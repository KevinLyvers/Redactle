armenian, endonym, hayeren, pronounced, is, an, indo, european, language, and, the, sole, member, of, the, independent, branch, of, the, armenian, language, family, it, is, the, native, language, of, the, armenian, people, and, the, official, language, of, armenia, historically, spoken, in, the, armenian, highlands, today, armenian, is, also, widely, spoken, throughout, the, armenian, diaspora, armenian, is, written, in, its, own, writing, system, the, armenian, alphabet, introduced, in, 405, ad, by, saint, mesrop, mashtots, the, estimated, number, of, armenian, speakers, worldwide, is, between, five, and, seven, million, pontic, steppe, caucasus, east, asia, eastern, europe, northern, europe, pontic, steppe, northern, eastern, steppe, europe, south, asia, steppe, europe, caucasus,

languages, it, is, of, interest, to, linguists, for, its, distinctive, phonological, changes, within, that, family, armenian, exhibits, more, satemization, than, centumization, although, it, is, not, classified, as, belonging, to, either, of, these, subgroups, some, linguists, tentatively, conclude, that, armenian, greek, and, phrygian, albanian, and, indo, iranian, were, dialectally, close, to, each, other, within, this, hypothetical, dialect, group, proto, armenian, was, situated, between, proto, greek, centum, subgroup, and, proto, indo, iranian, satem, subgroup, ronald, i, kim, has, noted, unique, morphological, developments, connecting, armenian, to, balto, slavic, languages, the, armenian, language, has, a, long, literary, history, with, a, 5th, century, bible, translation, as, its, oldest, surviving, text, another, text, translated, into, armenian, early, on, and, also, in, the, 5th, century, was, the, armenian, alexander, romance, the, vocabulary, of, the, language, has, historically, been, influenced, by, western, middle, iranian, languages, particularly, parthian, its, derivational, morphology, and, syntax, were, also, affected, by, language, contact, with, parthian, but, to, a, lesser, extent, contact, with, greek, persian, and, syriac, also, resulted, in, a, number, of, loanwords, there, are, two, standardized, modern, literary, forms, eastern, armenian, spoken, mainly, in, armenia, and, western, armenian, spoken, originally, mainly, in, modern, day, turkey, and, since, the, armenian, genocide, mostly, in, the, diaspora, the, differences, between, them, are, considerable, but, they, are, mutually, intelligible, after, significant, exposure, some, subdialects, such, as, homshetsi, are, not, mutually, intelligible, with, other, varieties, although, armenians, were, known, to, history, much, earlier, for, example, they, were, mentioned, in, the, 6th, century, bc, behistun, inscription, and, in, xenophon, s, 4th, century, bc, history, the, anabasis, the, oldest, surviving, armenian, language, writing, is, etched, in, stone, on, armenian, temples, and, is, called, mehenagir, the, armenian, alphabet, was, created, by, mesrop, mashtots, in, 405, at, which, time, it, had, 36, letters, he, is, also, credited, by, some, with, the, creation, of, the, georgian, alphabet, and, the, caucasian, albanian, alphabet, while, armenian, constitutes, the, sole, member, of, the, armenian, branch, of, the, indo, european, family, aram, kossian, has, suggested, that, the, hypothetical, mushki, language, may, have, been, a, now, extinct, armenic, language, w, m, austin, 1942, concluded, that, there, was, early, contact, between, armenian, and, anatolian, languages, based, on, what, he, considered, common, archaisms, such, as, the, lack, of, a, feminine, gender, and, the, absence, of, inherited, long, vowels, unlike, shared, innovations, or, synapomorphies, the, common, retention, of, archaisms, or, symplesiomorphy, is, not, considered, conclusive, evidence, of, a, period, of, common, isolated, development, there, are, words, used, in, armenian, that, are, generally, believed, to, have, been, borrowed, from, anatolian, languages, particularly, from, luwian, although, some, researchers, have, identified, possible, hittite, loanwords, as, well, one, notable, loanword, from, anatolian, is, armenian, xalam, skull, cognate, to, hittite, alanta, head, in, 1985, the, soviet, linguist, igor, m, diakonoff, noted, the, presence, in, classical, armenian, of, what, he, calls, a, caucasian, substratum, identified, by, earlier, scholars, consisting, of, loans, from, the, kartvelian, and, northeast, caucasian, languages, noting, that, hurro, urartian, speaking, peoples, inhabited, the, armenian, homeland, in, the, second, millennium, bc, diakonoff, identifies, in, armenian, a, hurro, urartian, substratum, of, social, cultural, and, animal, and, plant, terms, such, as, a, axin, slave, girl, hurr, al, l, a, e, enne, cov, sea, urart, inland, sea, u, t, camel, hurr, u, tu, and, xnjor, apple, tree, hurr, inzuri, some, of, the, terms, he, gives, admittedly, have, an, akkadian, or, sumerian, provenance, but, he, suggests, they, were, borrowed, through, hurrian, or, urartian, given, that, these, borrowings, do, not, undergo, sound, changes, characteristic, of, the, development, of, armenian, from, proto, indo, european, he, dates, their, borrowing, to, a, time, before, the, written, record, but, after, the, proto, armenian, language, stage, contemporary, linguists, such, as, hrach, martirosyan, have, rejected, many, of, the, hurro, urartian, and, northeast, caucasian, origins, for, these, words, and, instead, suggest, native, armenian, etymologies, leaving, the, possibility, that, these, words, may, have, been, loaned, into, hurro, urartian, and, caucasian, languages, from, armenian, and, not, vice, versa, a, notable, example, is, arciv, meaning, eagle, believed, to, have, been, the, origin, of, urartian, ar, ibi, and, northeast, caucasian, arzu, this, word, is, derived, from, proto, indo, european, h, r, ipy, s, with, cognates, in, sanskrit, jipy, avestan, r, zifiia, and, greek, aig, pios, hrach, martirosyan, and, armen, petrosyan, propose, additional, borrowed, words, of, armenian, origin, loaned, into, urartian, and, vice, versa, including, grammatical, words, and, parts, of, speech, such, as, urartian, eue, and, attested, in, the, earliest, urartian, texts, and, likely, a, loan, from, armenian, compare, to, armenian, yev, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, h, epi, other, loans, from, armenian, into, urartian, includes, personal, names, toponyms, and, names, of, deities, loan, words, from, iranian, languages, along, with, the, other, ancient, accounts, such, as, that, of, xenophon, above, initially, led, some, linguists, to, erroneously, classify, armenian, as, an, iranian, language, scholars, such, as, paul, de, lagarde, and, f, m, ller, believed, that, the, similarities, between, the, two, languages, meant, that, armenian, belonged, to, the, iranian, language, family, the, distinctness, of, armenian, was, recognized, when, philologist, heinrich, h, bschmann, 1875, used, the, comparative, method, to, distinguish, two, layers, of, iranian, words, from, the, older, armenian, vocabulary, he, showed, that, armenian, often, had, two, morphemes, for, one, concept, that, the, non, iranian, components, yielded, a, consistent, proto, indo, european, pattern, distinct, from, iranian, and, that, the, inflectional, morphology, was, different, from, that, of, iranian, languages, the, hypothesis, that, greek, is, armenian, s, closest, living, relative, originates, with, holger, pedersen, 1924, who, noted, that, the, number, of, greek, armenian, lexical, cognates, is, greater, than, that, of, agreements, between, armenian, and, any, other, indo, european, language, antoine, meillet, 1925, 1927, further, investigated, morphological, and, phonological, agreement, and, postulated, that, the, parent, languages, of, greek, and, armenian, were, dialects, in, immediate, geographical, proximity, during, the, proto, indo, european, period, meillet, s, hypothesis, became, popular, in, the, wake, of, his, book, esquisse, d, une, histoire, de, la, langue, latine, 1936, georg, renatus, solta, 1960, does, not, go, as, far, as, postulating, a, proto, graeco, armenian, stage, but, he, concludes, that, considering, both, the, lexicon, and, morphology, greek, is, clearly, the, dialect, to, be, most, closely, related, to, armenian, eric, p, hamp, 1976, 91, supports, the, graeco, armenian, thesis, and, even, anticipates, a, time, when, we, should, speak, of, helleno, armenian, meaning, the, postulate, of, a, graeco, armenian, proto, language, armenian, shares, the, augment, and, a, negator, derived, from, the, set, phrase, in, the, proto, indo, european, language, ne, h, oyu, k, id, never, anything, or, always, nothing, the, representation, of, word, initial, laryngeals, by, prothetic, vowels, and, other, phonological, and, morphological, peculiarities, with, greek, nevertheless, as, fortson, 2004, comments, by, the, time, we, reach, our, earliest, armenian, records, in, the, 5th, century, ad, the, evidence, of, any, such, early, kinship, has, been, reduced, to, a, few, tantalizing, pieces, graeco, armeno, aryan, is, a, hypothetical, clade, within, the, indo, european, family, ancestral, to, the, greek, language, the, armenian, language, and, the, indo, iranian, languages, graeco, aryan, unity, would, have, become, divided, into, proto, greek, and, proto, indo, iranian, by, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, bc, conceivably, proto, armenian, would, have, been, located, between, proto, greek, and, proto, indo, iranian, consistent, with, the, fact, that, armenian, shares, certain, features, only, with, indo, iranian, the, satem, change, but, others, only, with, greek, s, h, graeco, aryan, has, comparatively, wide, support, among, indo, europeanists, who, believe, the, indo, european, homeland, to, be, located, in, the, armenian, highlands, the, armenian, hypothesis, early, and, strong, evidence, was, given, by, euler, s, 1979, examination, on, shared, features, in, greek, and, sanskrit, nominal, flection, used, in, tandem, with, the, graeco, armenian, hypothesis, the, armenian, language, would, also, be, included, under, the, label, aryano, greco, armenic, splitting, into, proto, greek, phrygian, and, armeno, aryan, ancestor, of, armenian, and, indo, iranian, classical, armenian, arm, grabar, attested, from, the, 5th, century, to, the, 19th, century, as, the, literary, standard, up, to, the, 11th, century, also, as, a, spoken, language, with, different, varieties, was, partially, superseded, by, middle, armenian, attested, from, the, 12th, century, to, the, 18th, century, specialized, literature, prefers, old, armenian, for, grabar, as, a, whole, and, designates, as, classical, the, language, used, in, the, 5th, century, literature, post, classical, from, the, late, 5th, to, 8th, centuries, and, late, grabar, that, of, the, period, covering, the, 8th, to, 11th, centuries, later, it, was, used, mainly, in, religious, and, specialized, literature, with, the, exception, of, a, revival, during, the, early, modern, period, when, attempts, were, made, to, establish, it, as, the, language, of, a, literary, renaissance, with, neoclassical, inclinations, through, the, creation, and, dissemination, of, literature, in, varied, genres, especially, by, the, mekhitarists, the, first, armenian, periodical, azdarar, was, published, in, grabar, in, 1794, the, classical, form, borrowed, numerous, words, from, middle, iranian, languages, primarily, parthian, and, contains, smaller, inventories, of, loanwords, from, greek, syriac, aramaic, arabic, mongol, persian, and, indigenous, languages, such, as, urartian, an, effort, to, modernize, the, language, in, bagratid, armenia, and, the, armenian, kingdom, of, cilicia, 11, 14th, centuries, resulted, in, the, addition, of, two, more, characters, to, the, alphabet, and, bringing, the, total, number, to, 38, the, book, of, lamentations, by, gregory, of, narek, 951, 1003, is, an, example, of, the, development, of, a, literature, and, writing, style, of, old, armenian, by, the, 10th, century, in, addition, to, elevating, the, literary, style, and, vocabulary, of, the, armenian, language, by, adding, well, above, a, thousand, new, words, through, his, other, hymns, and, poems, gregory, paved, the, way, for, his, successors, to, include, secular, themes, and, vernacular, language, in, their, writings, the, thematic, shift, from, mainly, religious, texts, to, writings, with, secular, outlooks, further, enhanced, and, enriched, the, vocabulary, a, word, of, wisdom, a, poem, by, hovhannes, sargavak, devoted, to, a, starling, legitimizes, poetry, devoted, to, nature, love, or, female, beauty, gradually, the, interests, of, the, population, at, large, were, reflected, in, other, literary, works, as, well, konsdantin, yerzinkatsi, and, several, others, took, the, unusual, step, of, criticizing, the, ecclesiastic, establishment, and, addressing, the, social, issues, of, the, armenian, homeland, these, changes, represented, the, nature, of, the, literary, style, and, syntax, but, they, did, not, constitute, immense, changes, to, the, fundamentals, of, the, grammar, or, the, morphology, of, the, language, often, when, writers, codify, a, spoken, dialect, other, language, users, are, then, encouraged, to, imitate, that, structure, through, the, literary, device, known, as, parallelism, in, the, 19th, century, the, traditional, armenian, homeland, was, once, again, divided, this, time, eastern, armenia, was, conquered, from, qajar, iran, by, the, russian, empire, while, western, armenia, containing, two, thirds, of, historical, armenia, remained, under, ottoman, control, the, antagonistic, relationship, between, the, russian, and, ottoman, empires, led, to, creation, of, two, separate, and, different, environments, under, which, armenians, lived, halfway, through, the, 19th, century, two, important, concentrations, of, armenian, communities, were, further, consolidated, because, of, persecutions, or, the, search, for, better, economic, opportunities, many, armenians, living, under, ottoman, rule, gradually, moved, to, istanbul, whereas, tbilisi, became, the, center, of, armenians, living, under, russian, rule, these, two, cosmopolitan, cities, very, soon, became, the, primary, poles, of, armenian, intellectual, and, cultural, life, the, introduction, of, new, literary, forms, and, styles, as, well, as, many, new, ideas, sweeping, europe, reached, armenians, living, in, both, regions, this, created, an, ever, growing, need, to, elevate, the, vernacular, ashkharhabar, to, the, dignity, of, a, modern, literary, language, in, contrast, to, the, now, anachronistic, grabar, numerous, dialects, existed, in, the, traditional, armenian, regions, which, different, as, they, were, had, certain, morphological, and, phonetic, features, in, common, on, the, basis, of, these, features, two, major, standards, emerged, both, centers, vigorously, pursued, the, promotion, of, ashkharhabar, the, proliferation, of, newspapers, in, both, versions, eastern, western, and, the, development, of, a, network, of, schools, where, modern, armenian, was, taught, dramatically, increased, the, rate, of, literacy, in, spite, of, the, obstacles, by, the, colonial, administrators, even, in, remote, rural, areas, the, emergence, of, literary, works, entirely, written, in, the, modern, versions, increasingly, legitimized, the, language, s, existence, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, both, varieties, of, the, one, modern, armenian, language, prevailed, over, grabar, and, opened, the, path, to, a, new, and, simplified, grammatical, structure, of, the, language, in, the, two, different, cultural, spheres, apart, from, several, morphological, phonetic, and, grammatical, differences, the, largely, common, vocabulary, and, generally, analogous, rules, of, grammatical, fundamentals, allows, users, of, one, variant, to, understand, the, other, as, long, as, they, are, fluent, in, one, of, the, literary, standards, after, world, war, i, the, existence, of, the, two, modern, versions, of, the, same, language, was, sanctioned, even, more, clearly, the, armenian, soviet, socialist, republic, 1920, 1990, used, eastern, armenian, as, its, official, language, whereas, the, diaspora, created, after, the, armenian, genocide, preserved, the, western, armenian, dialect, the, two, modern, literary, dialects, western, originally, associated, with, writers, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, eastern, originally, associated, with, writers, in, the, russian, empire, removed, almost, all, of, their, turkish, lexical, influences, in, the, 20th, century, primarily, following, the, armenian, genocide, in, addition, to, armenia, and, turkey, where, it, is, indigenous, armenian, is, spoken, among, the, diaspora, according, to, ethnologue, globally, there, are, 1, 6, million, western, armenian, speakers, and, 3, 7, million, eastern, armenian, speakers, totalling, 5, 3, million, armenian, speakers, in, georgia, armenian, speakers, are, concentrated, in, ninotsminda, and, akhalkalaki, districts, where, they, represent, over, 90, of, the, population, the, short, lived, first, republic, of, armenia, declared, armenian, its, official, language, eastern, armenian, was, then, dominating, in, institutions, and, among, the, population, when, armenia, was, incorporated, into, the, ussr, the, armenian, soviet, socialist, republic, made, eastern, armenian, the, language, of, the, courts, government, institutions, and, schools, armenia, was, also, russified, the, current, republic, of, armenia, upholds, the, official, status, of, the, armenian, language, eastern, armenian, is, the, official, variant, used, making, it, the, prestige, variety, while, other, variants, have, been, excluded, from, national, institutions, indeed, western, armenian, is, perceived, by, some, as, a, mere, dialect, armenian, was, also, official, in, the, republic, of, artsakh, it, is, recognized, as, an, official, language, of, the, eurasian, economic, union, although, russian, is, the, working, language, armenian, without, reference, to, a, specific,

tense, mood, and, aspect, armenian, is, a, pluricentric, language, having, two, modern, standardized, forms, eastern, armenian, and, western, armenian, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, western, armenian, is, that, it, has, undergone, several, phonetic, mergers, these, may, be, due, to, proximity, to, arabic, and, turkish, speaking, communities, classical, armenian, grabar, which, remained, the, standard, until, the, 18th, century, was, quite, homogeneous, across, the, different, regions, that, works, in, it, were, written, it, may, have, been, a, cross, regional, standard, the, middle, armenian, variety, used, in, the, court, of, cilician, armenia, 1080, 1375, provides, a, window, into, the, development, of, western, armenian, which, came, to, be, based, on, what, became, the, dialect, of, istanbul, while, the, standard, for, eastern, armenian, was, based, on, the, dialect, around, mount, ararat, and, yerevan, although, the, armenian, language, is, often, divided, into, east, and, west, the, two, standards, are, actually, relatively, close, to, each, other, in, light, of, wealth, of, the, diversity, present, among, regional, non, standard, armenian, dialects, the, different, dialects, have, experienced, different, degrees, of, language, contact, effects, often, with, turkic, and, caucasian, languages, for, some, the, result, has, been, significant, phonological, and, syntactic, changes, fortson, notes, that, the, modern, standard, as, well, has, now, attained, a, subordinate, clausal, structure, that, greatly, resembles, a, turkic, language, eastern, armenian, speakers, pronounce, as, as, and, as, a, tenuis, occlusive, western, armenian, has, simplified, the, occlusive, system, into, a, simple, division, between, voiced, occlusives, and, aspirated, ones, the, first, series, corresponds, to, the, tenuis, series, of, eastern, armenian, and, the, second, corresponds, to, the, eastern, voiced, and, aspirated, series, thus, the, western, dialect, pronounces, both, and, as, and, the, letter, as, there, is, no, precise, linguistic, border, between, one, dialect, and, another, because, there, is, nearly, always, a, dialect, transition, zone, of, some, size, between, pairs, of, geographically, identified, dialects, armenian, can, be, divided, into, two, major, dialectal, blocks, and, those, blocks, into, individual, dialects, though, many, of, the, western, armenian, dialects, have, become, extinct, due, to, the, effects, of, the, armenian, genocide, in, addition, neither, dialect, is, completely, homogeneous, any, dialect, can, be, subdivided, into, several, subdialects, although, western, and, eastern, armenian, are, often, described, as, different, dialects, of, the, same, language, many, subdialects, are, not, readily, mutually, intelligible, nevertheless, a, fluent, speaker, of, one, of, two, greatly, varying, dialects, who, is, also, literate, in, one, of, the, standards, when, exposed, to, the, other, dialect, for, a, period, of, time, will, be, able, to, understand, the, other, with, relative, ease, distinct, western, armenian, varieties, currently, in, use, include, homshetsi, spoken, by, the, hemshin,

armenians, in, crimea, where, they, came, from, in, order, to, establish, the, town, and, surrounding, villages, in, 1779, western, armenian, dialects, are, currently, spoken, also, in, gavar, formerly, nor, bayazet, and, kamo, on, the, western, shore, of, lake, sevan, aparan, and, talin, in, armenia, mush, dialect, and, by, the, large, armenian, population, residing, in, abkhazia, where,

or, armenian, romanized, hayots, aybuben, is, a, graphically, unique, alphabetical, writing, system, that, is, used, to, write, the, armenian, language, it, was, introduced, around, ad, 405, by, mesrop, mashtots, an, armenian, linguist, and, ecclesiastical, leader, and, originally, contained, 36, letters, two, more, letters, and, f, were, added, in, the, middle, ages, during, the, 1920s, orthography, reform, in, soviet, armenia, a, new, letter, capital, was, added, which, was, a, ligature, before, whereas, the, letter, was, discarded, and, reintroduced, as, part, of, a, new, letter, which, was, a, digraph, before, this, alphabet, and, associated, orthography, is, used, by, most, armenian, speakers, of, armenia, and, the, countries, of, the, former, soviet, union, neither, the, alphabet, nor, the, orthography, has, been, adopted, by, diaspora, armenians, including, eastern, armenian, speakers, of, iran, and, all, western, armenian, speakers, who, keep, using, the, traditional, alphabet, and, spelling, armenian, is, an, indo, european, language, so, many, of, its, proto, indo, european, descended, words, are, cognates, of, words, in, other, indo, european, languages, such, as, english, latin, greek, and, sanskrit, due, to, extensive, loaning, only, around, 1, 500, words, g, jahukyan, are, known, to, have, been, inherited, from, indo, european, by, the, classical, armenian, stage, the, rest, were, lost, a, fact, that, presents, a, major, challenge, to, endeavors, to, better, understand, proto, armenian, and, its, place, within, the, family, especially, as, many, of, the, sound, changes, along, the, way, from, indo, european, to, armenian, remain, quite, difficult, to, analyze, this, table, lists, some, of, the, more, recognizable,
