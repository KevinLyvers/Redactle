centuries, after, 1700, the, united, states, gained, population, rapidly, and, imports, as, well, as, exports, grew, along, with, it, africa, asia, and, most, frequently, europe, contributed, to, the, trade, of, the, colonies, these, 13, colonies, gained, independence, from, the, british, empire, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, quickly, grew, from, colonial, economies, towards, an, economy, focused, on, agriculture, in, 180, years, the, united, states, grew, to, become, a, huge, integrated, and, industrialized, economy, which, made, up, about, a, fifth, of, the, world, economy, in, that,

compare, the, severity, of, modern, recessions, to, that, of, early, recessions, recessions, after, world, war, ii, appear, to, have, been, less, severe, than, earlier, recessions, but, the, reasons, for, this, are, unclear, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, new, innovations, and, improvements, in, existing, innovations, opened, the, door, for, improvements, in, the, standard, of, living,

prices, and, more, output, in, these, industries, many, workers, shared, the, success, of, these, large, firms, which, typically, offered, the, highest, wages, in, the, world, the, united, states, has, been, the, world, s, largest, national, economy, in, terms, of, gdp, since, around, 1890, for, many, years, following, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, when, the, danger, of, recession, appeared, most, serious, the, government, strengthened, the, economy, by, spending, heavily, itself, or, cutting, taxes, so, that, consumers, would, spend, more, and, by, fostering, rapid, growth, in, the, money, supply, which, also, encouraged, more, spending, ideas, about, the, best, tools, for, stabilizing, the, economy, changed, substantially, between, the, 1930s, and, the, 1980s, from, the, new, deal, era, that, began, in, 1933, to, the, great, society, initiatives, of, the, 1960s, national, policymakers, relied, principally, on, fiscal, policy, to, influence, the, economy, during, the, world, wars, of, the, twentieth, century, the, united, states, fared, better, than, the, rest, of, the, combatants, because, none, of, the, first, world, war, and, relatively, little, of, the, second, world, war, were, fought, on, american, territory, and, none, on, the, then, 48, states, yet, even, in, the, united, states, the, wars, meant, sacrifice, during, the, peak, of, second, world, war, activity, nearly, 40, percent, of, u, s, gdp, was, devoted, to, war, production, decisions, about, large, swaths, of, the, economy, were, largely, made, for, military, purposes, and, nearly, all, relevant, inputs, were, allocated, to, the, war, effort, many, goods, were, rationed, prices, and, wages, controlled, and, many, durable, consumer, goods, were, no, longer, produced, large, segments, of, the, workforce, were, inducted, into, the, military, and, paid, half, their, wages, roughly, half, of, those, were, sent, into, harm, s, way, the, approach, advanced, by, british, economist, john,

a, dramatic, increase, in, fertility, in, the, period, 1942, 1957, it, was, caused, by, delayed, marriages, and, childbearing, during, the, depression, years, a, surge, in, prosperity, a, demand, for, suburban, single, family, homes, as, opposed, to, inner, city, apartments, and, new, optimism, about, the, future, the, boom, peaked, around, 1957, and, then, began, to, fade, a, period, of, high, inflation, interest, rates, and, unemployment, after, 1973, weakened, confidence, in, fiscal, policy, as, a, tool, for, regulating, the, overall, pace, of, economic, activity, the, u, s, economy, grew, by, an, average, of, 3, 8, from, 1946, to, 1973, while, real, median, household, income, surged, by, 74, or, 2, 1, a, year, since, the, 1970s, several, emerging, countries, have, begun, to, close, the, economic, gap, with, the, united, states, in, most, cases, this, has, been, due, to, moving, the, manufacture, of, goods, formerly, made, in, the, u, s, to, countries, where, they, could, be, made, for, sufficiently, less, money, to, cover, the, cost, of, shipping, plus, a, higher, profit, in, other, cases, some, countries, have, gradually, learned, to, produce, the, same, products, and, services, that, previously, only, the, u, s, and, a, few, other, countries, could, produce, real, income, growth, in, the, u, s, has, slowed, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, it, was, popular, in, the, u, s, to, believe, that, japan, s, economy, would, surpass, that, of, the, u, s, but, this, did, not, occur, the, united, states, economy, experienced, a, recession, in, 2001, with, an, unusually, slow, jobs, recovery, with, the, number, of, jobs, not, regaining, the, february, 2001, level, until, january, 2005, this, jobless, recovery, overlapped, with, the, building, of, a, housing, bubble, and, arguably, a, wider, debt, bubble, as, the, ratio, of, household, debt, to, gdp, rose, from, a, record, level, of, 70, in, q1, 2001, to, 99, in, q1, 2008, homeowners, were, borrowing, against, their, bubble, priced, homes, to, fuel, consumption, driving, up, their, debt, levels, while, providing, an, unsustainable, boost, to, gdp, when, housing, prices, began, falling, in, 2006, the, value, of, securities, backed, by, mortgages, fell, dramatically, causing, the, equivalent, of, a, bank, run, in, the, essentially, unregulated, non, depository, banking, system, which,

2008, with, the, banking, crisis, peaking, in, september, 2008, with, the, bankruptcy, of, lehman, brothers, and, bailouts, of, several, other, financial, institutions, the, bush, administration, 2001, 2009, and, obama, administrations, 2009, 2017, applied, banking, bailout, programs, and, keynesian, stimulus, via, high, government, deficits, while, the, federal, reserve, maintained, near, zero, interest, rates, these, measures, helped, the, economy, recover, as, households, paid, down, debts, in, 2009, 2012, the, only, years, since, 1947, where, this, occurred, presenting, a, significant, barrier, to, recovery, real, gdp, regained, its, pre, crisis, late, 2007, peak, by, 2011, household, net, worth, by, q2, 2012, non, farm, payroll, jobs, by, may, 2014, and, the, unemployment, rate, by, september, 2015, each, of, these, variables, continued, into, post, recession, record, territory, following, those, dates, with, the, u, s, recovery, becoming, the, second, longest, on, record, in, april, 2018, a, significant, recession, as, defined, lost, economic, output, occurred, during, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, when, gdp, fell, by, 5, 0, from, the, spring, of, 2008, to, the, spring, of, 2009, other, significant, recessions, took, place, in, 1957, 1958, when, gdp, fell, 3, 7, following, the, 1973, oil, crisis, with, a, 3, 1, fall, from, late,

north, and, east, further, those, 18, states, that, have, not, expanded, medicaid, had, a, higher, uninsured, rate, than, those, that, did, according, to, physicians, for, a, national, health, program, this, lack, of, insurance, causes, roughly, 48, 000, unnecessary, deaths, per, year, the, group, s, methodology, has, been, criticized, by, john, c, goodman, for, not, looking, at, cause, of, death, or, tracking, insurance, status, changes, over, time, including, the, time, of, death, a, 2009, study, by, former, clinton, policy, adviser, richard, kronick, found, no, increased, mortality,

the, u, s, economy, as, too, short, sighted, targeting, either, the, next, election, or, the, next, news, cycle, rather, than, making, difficult, choices, that, favor, long, term, benefits, despite, short, term, pain, and, favoring, policies, that, sound, good, and, avoiding, those, that, sound, bad, regardless, of, merit, when, examined, rigorously, by, economists, the, u, s, federal, government, regulates, private, enterprise, in, numerous, ways, regulation, falls, into, two, general, categories, some, efforts, seek, either, directly, or, indirectly, to, control, prices, traditionally, the, government, has, sought, to, create, state, regulated, monopolies, such, as, electric, utilities, while, allowing, prices, in, the, level, that, would, ensure, them, normal, profits, at, times, the, government, has, extended, economic, control, to, other, kinds, of, industries, as, well, in, the, years, following, the, great, depression, it, devised, a, complex, system, to, stabilize, prices, for, agricultural, goods, which, tend, to, fluctuate, wildly, in, response, to, rapidly, changing, supply, and, demand, a, number, of, other, industries, trucking, and, later, airlines, successfully, sought, regulation, themselves, to, limit, what, they, considered, as, harmful, price, cutting, a, process, called, regulatory, capture, another, form, of, economic, regulation, antitrust, law, seeks, to, strengthen, market, forces, so, that, direct, regulation, is, unnecessary, the, government, and, sometimes, private, parties, have, used, antitrust, law, to, prohibit, practices, or, mergers, that, would, unduly, limit, competition, bank, regulation, in, the, united, states, is, highly, fragmented, compared, to, other, g10, countries, where, most, countries, have, only, one, bank, regulator, in, the, u, s, banking, is, regulated, at, both, the, federal, and, state, level, the, u, s, also, has, one, of, the, most, highly, regulated, banking, environments, in, the, world, however, many, of, the, regulations, are, not, soundness, related, but, are, instead, focused, on, privacy, disclosure, fraud, prevention, anti, money, laundering, anti, terrorism, anti, usury, lending, and, promoting, lending, to, lower, income, segments, since, the, 1970s, government, has, also, exercised, control, over, private, companies, to, achieve, social, goals, such, as, improving, the, public, s, health, and, safety, or, maintaining, a, healthy, environment, for, example, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, provides, and, enforces, standards, for, workplace, safety, and, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, provides, standards, and, regulations, to, maintain, air, water, and, land, resources, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, regulates, what, drugs, may, reach, the, market, and, also, provides, standards, of, disclosure, for, food, products, american, attitudes, about, regulation, changed, substantially, during, the, final, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, beginning, in, the, 1970s, policy, makers, grew, increasingly, convinced, that, economic, regulation, protected, companies, at, the, expense, of, consumers, in, industries, such, as, airlines, and, trucking, at, the, same, time, technological, changes, spawned, new, competitors, in, some, industries, such, as, telecommunications, that, once, were, considered, natural, monopolies, both, developments, led, to, a, succession, of, laws, easing, regulation, while, leaders, of, america, s, two, most, influential, political, parties, generally, favored, economic, deregulation, during, the, 1970s, 1980s, and, 1990s, there, was, less, agreement, concerning, regulations, designed, to, achieve, social, goals, social, regulation, had, assumed, growing, importance, in, the, years, following, the, depression, and, world, war, ii, and, again, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, during, the, 1980s, the, government,
