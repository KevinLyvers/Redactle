the, cosmic, ocean, of, milk, by, the, devas, gods, and, the, asuras, demons, a, vedic, legend, that, is, also, found, in, several, puranas, such, as, the, padma, purana, while, the, night, of, diwali, is, when, lakshmi, chose, and, wed, vishnu, along, with, lakshmi, who, is, representative, of, vaishnavism, ganesha, the, elephant, headed, son, of, parvati, and, shiva, of, shaivism, tradition, is, remembered, as, one, who, symbolises, ethical, beginnings, and, the, remover, of, obstacles, hindus, of, eastern, india, associate, the, festival, with, the, goddess, kali, who, symbolises, the, victory, of, good, over, evil, hindus, from, the, braj, region, in, northern, india, parts, of, assam, as, well, as, southern, tamil, and, telugu, communities, view, diwali, as, the, day, the, god, krishna, overcame, and, destroyed, the, evil, demon, king, narakasura, in, yet, another, symbolic, victory, of, knowledge, and, good, over, ignorance, and, evil, trade, and, merchant,

western, states, such, as, gujarat, and, certain, northern, hindu, communities, of, india, the, festival, of, diwali, signifies, the, start, of, a, new, year, mythical, tales, shared, on, diwali, vary, widely, depending, on, region, and, even, within, hindu, tradition, yet, all, share, a, common, focus, on, righteousness, self, inquiry, and, the, importance, of, knowledge, which, according, to, lindsey, harlan, an, indologist, and, scholar, of, religious, studies, is, the, path, to, overcoming, the, darkness, of, ignorance, the, telling, of, these, myths, are, reminiscent, of, the, hindu, belief, that, good, ultimately, triumphs, over, evil, originally, a, hindu, festival, diwali, has, transcended, religious, lines, diwali, is, celebrated, by, hindus, jains, sikhs, and, newar, buddhists, although, for, each, faith, it, marks, different, historical, events, and, stories, but, nonetheless, the, festival, represents, the, same, symbolic, victory, of, light, over, darkness, knowledge, over, ignorance, and, good, over, evil, a, scholar, of, jain, and, nivethan, states, that, in, jain, tradition, diwali, is, celebrated, in, observance, of, mahavira, nirvana, divas, the, physical, death, and, final, nirvana, of, mahavira, the, jain, diwali, celebrated, in, many, parts, of, india, has, similar, practices, to, the, hindu, diwali, such, as, the, lighting, of, lamps, and, the, offering, of, prayers, to, lakshmi, however, the, focus, of, the, jain, diwali, remains, the, dedication, to, mahavira, according, to, the, jain, tradition, this, practice, of, lighting, lamps, first, began, on, the, day, of, mahavira, s, nirvana, in, 527, bce, when, 18, kings, who, had, gathered, for, mahavira, s, final, teachings, issued, a, proclamation, that, lamps, be, lit, in, remembrance, of, the, great, light, mahavira, this, traditional, belief, of, the, origin, of, diwali, and, its, significance, to, jains, is, reflected, in, their, historic, artworks, such, as, paintings, sikhs, celebrate, bandi, chhor, divas, in, remembrance, of, the, release, of, guru, hargobind, from, the, gwalior, fort, prison, by, the, mughal, emperor, jahangir, and, the, day, he, arrived, at, the, golden, temple, in, amritsar, according, to, j, s, grewal, a, scholar, of, sikhism, and, sikh, history, diwali, in, the, sikh, tradition, is, older, than, the, sixth, guru, hargobind, legend, guru, amar, das, the, third, guru, of, the, sikhs, built, a, well, in, goindwal, with, eighty, four, steps, and, invited, sikhs, to, bathe, in, its, sacred, waters, on, baisakhi, and, diwali, as, a, form, of, community, bonding, over, time, these, spring, and, autumn, festivals, became, the, most, important, of, sikh, festivals, and, holy, sites, such, as, amritsar, became, focal, points, for, annual, pilgrimages, the, festival, of, diwali, according, to, ray, colledge, highlights, three, events, in, sikh, history, the, founding, of, the, city, of, amritsar, in, 1577, the, release, of, guru, hargobind, from, the, mughal, prison, and, the, day, of, bhai, mani, singh, s, martyrdom, in, 1738, as, a, result, of, his, failure, to, pay, a, fine, for, trying, to, celebrate, diwali, and, thereafter, refusing, to, convert, to, islam, diwali, is, not, a, festival, for, most, buddhists, with, the, exception, of, the, newar, people, of, nepal, who, revere, various,

much, the, same, way, and, on, the, same, days, as, the, nepalese, hindu, diwali, tihar, festival, according, to, some, observers, this, traditional, celebration, by, newar, buddhists, in, nepal, through, the, worship, of, lakshmi, and, vishnu, during, diwali, is, not, syncretism, but, rather, a, reflection, of, the, freedom, within, mahayana, buddhist, tradition, to, worship, any, deity, for,

on, the, puja, dedicated, to, kali, these, two, festivals, likely, developed, in, tandem, over, their, recent, histories, states, mcdermott, textual, evidence, suggests, that, bengali, hindus,
