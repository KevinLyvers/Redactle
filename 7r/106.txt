the, yen, japanese, symbol, code, jpy, is, the, official, currency, of, japan, it, is, the, third, most, traded, currency, in, the, foreign, exchange, market, after, the, united, states, dollar, and, the, euro, it, is, also, widely, used, as, a, third, reserve, currency, after, the, us, dollar, and, the, euro, the, new, currency, act, of, 1871, introduced, japan, s, modern, currency, system, with, the, yen, defined, as, 1, 5, g, 0, 048, troy, ounces, of, gold, or, 24, 26, g, 0, 780, troy, ounces, of, silver, and, divided, decimally, into, 100, sen, or, 1, 000, rin, the, yen, replaced, the, previous, tokugawa, coinage, as, well, as, the, various, hansatsu, paper, currencies, issued, by, feudal, han, fiefs, the, bank, of, japan, was, founded, in, 1882, and, given, a, monopoly, on, controlling, the, money, supply, following, world, war, ii, the, yen, lost, much, of, its, pre, war, value, to, stabilize, the, japanese, economy, the, exchange, rate, of, the, yen, was, fixed, at, 360, per, us, as, part, of, the, bretton, woods, system, when, that, system, was, abandoned, in, 1971, the, yen, became, undervalued, and, was, allowed, to, float, the, yen, had, appreciated, to, a, peak, of, 271, per, us, in, 1973, then, underwent, periods, of, depreciation, and, appreciation, due, to, the, 1973, oil, crisis, arriving, at, a, value, of, 227, per, us, by, 1980, since, 1973, the, government, of, japan, has, maintained, a, policy, of, currency, intervention, so, the, yen, is, under, a, managed, float, regime, the, japanese, government, focused, on, a, competitive, export, market, and, tried, to, ensure, a, low, exchange, rate, for, the, yen, through, a, trade, surplus, the, plaza, accord, of, 1985, temporarily, changed, this, situation, the, exchange, rate, fell, from, its, average, of, 239, per, dollar, in, 1985, to, 128, in, 1988, and, led, to, a, peak, rate, of, 80, against, the, us, in, 1995, effectively, increasing, the, value, of, japan, s, gdp, in, dollar, terms, to, almost, that, of, the, united, states, since, that, time, however, the, world, price, of, the, yen, has, greatly, decreased, falling, to, an, average, of, almost, 158, per, dollar, and, 171, per, euro, in, july, 2024, the, bank, of, japan, maintains, a, policy, of, zero, to, near, zero, interest, rates, and, the, japanese, government, has, previously, had, a, strict, anti, inflation, policy, from, late, 2021, to, first, half, 2024, the, yen, depreciated, against, the, dollar, by, about, 50, giving, rise, to, serious, concern, in, japan, about, long, term, prospects, for, the, currency, the, sharp, fall, in, the, value, of, the, currency, has, led, some, companies, including, modec, to, stop, presenting, their, financial, statements, in, japanese, yen, however, this, weakness, has, had, some, benefits, for, japan, s, tourism, industry, as, the, low, exchange, rate, makes, its, purchasing, power, attractive, for, travellers, particularly, those, from, foreign, nations, the, name, yen, derives, from, the, japanese, word, en, round, which, borrows, its, phonetic, reading, from, chinese, yuan, similar, to, north, korean, won, and, south, korean, won, originally, the, chinese, had, traded, silver, in, mass, called, sycees, and, when, spanish, and, mexican, silver, coins, arrived, from, the, philippines, the, chinese, called, them, silver, rounds, chinese, pinyin, y, nyu, n, for, their, circular, shapes, the, coins, and, the, name, also, appeared, in, japan, while, the, chinese, eventually, replaced, with, the, japanese, continued, to, use, the, same, word, which, was, given, the, shinjitai, form, in, reforms, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, spelling, and, pronunciation, yen, is, standard, in, english, because, when, japan, was, first, encountered, by, europeans, around, the, 16th, century, japanese, e, and, we, both, had, been, pronounced, and, portuguese, missionaries, had, spelled, them, ye, by, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, e, and, we, came, to, be, pronounced, as, in, modern, japanese, although, some, regions, retain, the, pronunciation, walter, henry, medhurst, who, had, neither, been, to, japan, nor, met, any, japanese, people, having, consulted, mainly, a, japanese, dutch, dictionary, spelled, some, e, s, as, ye, in, his, an, english, and, japanese, and, japanese, and, english, vocabulary, 1830, in, the, early, meiji, era, james, curtis, hepburn, following, medhurst, spelled, all, e, s, as, ye, in, his, a, japanese, and, english, dictionary, 1867, in, japanese, e, and, i, are, slightly, palatalized, somewhat, as, in, russian, that, was, the, first, full, scale, japanese, english, english, japanese, dictionary, which, had, a, strong, influence, on, westerners, in, japan, and, probably, prompted, the, spelling, yen, hepburn, revised, most, ye, s, to, e, in, the, 3rd, edition, 1886, to, mirror, the, contemporary, pronunciation, except, yen, although, the, edo, shogunate, collapsed, with, the, meiji, restoration, and, a, new, government, was, born, the, monetary, system, still, took, over, that, of, the, former, entity, during, this, unstable, period, the, confusion, caused, by, this, form, of, exchange, caused, economic, turmoil, the, gold, counting, money, system, of, eastern, japan, and, the, silver, weighing, money, system, of, the, western, japan, were, not, unified, and, the, difference, in, the, gold, silver, ratio, caused, a, large, amount, of, gold, to, flow, overseas, at, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, emperor, meiji, responded, to, this, by, appointing, kuma, shigenobu, as, head, of, japan, s, monetary, reform, program, he, worked, with, inoue, kaoru, it, hirobumi, and, shibusawa, eiichi, to, run, the, ministry, of, finance, seeking, to, introduce, a, modern, monetary, system, into, japan, kuma, eventually, proposed, that, coins, which, were, previously, square, be, made, into, circles, and, that, the, names, of, the, traditional, currencies, ry, bu, and, shu, be, unified, into, yen, which, was, accepted, by, the, government, other, rejected, proposals, included, physical, weight, units, of, fun, and, momme, which, never, made, it, past, the, pattern, stage, the, first, gold, yen, coins, consisted, of, 2, 5, and, 20, yen, coins, which, were, struck, throughout, 1870, five, yen, coins, were, first, struck, in, gold, for, the, japanese, government, in, 1870, at, the, san, francisco, mint, during, this, time, a, new, mint, was, being, established, at, osaka, which, did, not, receive, the, gold, bullion, needed, for, coinage, until, the, following, year, gold, bullion, was, delivered, from, private, japanese, citizens, foreigners, and, the, japanese, government, initially, the, government, opted, for, silver, which, would, become, the, standard, unit, of, value, leaving, gold, coinage, as, a, subsidiary, while, gold, coinage, couldn, t, be, produced, domestically, in, 1870, the, mint, at, osaka, could, produce, silver, coins, which, included, denominations, of, 5, 10, 20, and, 50, sen, none, of, these, coins, dated, 1870, circulated, until, the, meiji, government, officially, adopted, the, yen, as, japan, s, modern, unit, of, currency, on, june, 27, 1871, this, act, formally, stipulated, the, adoption, of, the, decimal, accounting, system, of, yen, 1, sen, 1, 100, and, rin, 1, 1000, the, new, currency, was, gradually, introduced, beginning, from, july, of, that, year, japanese, yen, denominated, paper, currency, was, also, conceived, with, the, coins, in, 1870, as, meiji, tsuho, notes, by, italian, engraver, edoardo, chiossone, these, were, released, as, fiat, currency, in, denominations, of, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, and, 100, yen, along, with, subsidiary, notes, of, 10, 20, and, 50, sen, in, 1872, almost, concurrently, the, government, established, a, series, of, national, banks, modeled, after, the, system, in, the, united, states, which, issued, national, bank, notes, massive, inflation, from, the, satsuma, rebellion, in, 1877, caused, a, glut, of, non, redeemable, fiat, currency, notes, the, issuance, of, national, fiat, banknotes, was, ultimately, suspended, in, 1880, by, then, prime, minister, matsukata, masayoshi, new, policies, were, put, into, place, which, included, the, establishment, of, a, centralized, banking, system, the, bank, of, japan, hence, commenced, operations, on, october, 10, 1882, with, the, authority, to, print, banknotes, that, could, be, exchanged, for, the, old, government, and, national, bank, notes, by, may, 1883, another, act, provided, the, redemption, and, retirement, of, national, bank, notes, the, national, bank, act, was, amended, again, in, march, 1896, providing, for, the, dissolution, of, the, national, banks, on, the, expiration, of, their, charters, this, amendment, also, prohibited, national, bank, notes, from, circulating, after, december, 31, 1899, in, that, year, japan, adopted, a, gold, exchange, standard, defining, the, yen, as, 0, 75, g, fine, gold, or, us, 0, 4985, this, exchange, rate, remained, in, place, until, japan, left, the, gold, standard, in, december, 1931, after, which, the, yen, fell, to, 0, 30, by, july, 1932, and, to, 0, 20, by, 1933, it, remained, steady, at, around, 0, 30, until, the, start, of, the, pacific, war, on, december, 7, 1941, at, which, time, it, fell, to, 0, 23, the, sen, and, the, rin, were, eventually, taken, out, of, circulation, at, the, end, of, 1953, no, true, exchange, rate, existed, for, the, yen, between, december, 7, 1941, and, april, 25, 1949, wartime, inflation, reduced, the, yen, to, a, fraction, of, its, prewar, value, after, a, period, of, instability, on, april, 25, 1949, the, u, s, occupation, government, fixed, the, value, of, the, yen, at, 360, per, usd, through, a, united, states, plan, which, was, part, of, the, bretton, woods, system, to, stabilize, prices, in, the, japanese, economy, that, exchange, rate, was, maintained, until, 1971, when, the, united, states, abandoned, the, gold, standard, ending, a, key, element, of, the, bretton, woods, system, and, setting, in, motion, changes, that, eventually, led, to, floating, exchange, rates, in, 1973, by, 1971, the, yen, had, become, undervalued, japanese, exports, were, costing, too, little, in, international, markets, and, imports, from, abroad, were, costing, the, japanese, too, much, this, undervaluation, was, reflected, in, the, current, account, balance, which, had, risen, from, the, deficits, of, the, early, 1960s, to, a, then, large, surplus, of, us, 5, 8, billion, in, 1971, the, belief, that, the, yen, and, several, other, major, currencies, were, undervalued, motivated, the, united, states, actions, in, 1971, following, the, united, states, measures, to, devalue, the, dollar, in, the, summer, of, 1971, the, japanese, government, agreed, to, a, new, fixed, exchange, rate, as, part, of, the, smithsonian, agreement, signed, at, the, end, of, the, year, this, agreement, set, the, exchange, rate, at, 308, per, us, however, the, new, fixed, rates, of, the, smithsonian, agreement, were, difficult, to, maintain, in, the, face, of, supply, and, demand, pressures, in, the, foreign, exchange, market, in, early, 1973, the, rates, were, abandoned, and, the, major, nations, of, the, world, allowed, their, currencies, to, float, after, world, war, ii, the, united, states, administered, okinawa, issued, a, higher, valued, currency, called, the, b, yen, from, 1946, to, 1958, which, was, then, replaced, by, the, u, s, dollar, at, the, rate, of, 1, 120, b, yen, upon, the, reversion, of, okinawa, to, japan, in, 1972, the, japanese, yen, then, replaced, the, dollar, in, light, of, the, dollar, s, reduction, in, value, from, 360, to, 308, just, before, the, reversion, an, unannounced, currency, confirmation, took, place, on, october, 9, 1971, wherein, residents, disclosed, their, dollar, holdings, in, cash, and, bank, accounts, dollars, held, that, day, amounting, to, us, 60, million, were, entitled, for, conversion, in, 1972, at, a, higher, rate, of, 360, in, the, 1970s, japanese, government, and, business, people, were, very, concerned, that, a, rise, in, the, value, of, the, yen, would, hurt, export, growth, by, making, japanese, products, less, competitive, and, would, damage, the, industrial, base, the, government, therefore, continued, to, intervene, heavily, in, foreign, exchange, marketing, buying, or, selling, dollars, even, after, the, 1973, decision, to, allow, the, yen, to, float, despite, intervention, market, pressures, caused, the, yen, to, continue, climbing, in, value, peaking, temporarily, at, an, average, of, 271, per, us, in, 1973, before, the, impact, of, the, 1973, oil, crisis, was, felt, this, was, retroactively, called, endaka, although, the, term, was, only, coined, in, 1985, the, increased, costs, of, imported, oil, caused, the, yen, to, depreciate, to, a, range, of, 290, per, us, to, 300, per, us, between, 1974, and, 1976, the, re, emergence, of, trade, surpluses, drove, the, yen, back, up, to, 211, in, 1978, this, currency, strengthening, was, again, reversed, by, the, second, oil, shock, in, 1979, with, the, yen, dropping, to, 227, per, us, by, 1980, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1980s, the, yen, failed, to, rise, in, value, though, current, account, surpluses, returned, and, grew, quickly, from, 221, per, us, in, 1981, the, average, value, of, the, yen, actually, dropped, to, 239, per, us, in, 1985, the, rise, in, the, current, account, surplus, generated, stronger, demand, for, yen, in, foreign, exchange, markets, but, this, trade, related, demand, for, yen, was, offset, by, other, factors, a, wide, differential, in, interest, rates, with, united, states, interest, rates, much, higher, than, those, in, japan, and, the, continuing, moves, to, deregulate, the, international, flow, of, capital, led, to, a, large, net, outflow, of, capital, from, japan, this, capital, flow, increased, the, supply, of, yen, in, foreign, exchange, markets, as, japanese, investors, changed, their, yen, for, other, currencies, mainly, dollars, to, invest, overseas, this, kept, the, yen, weak, relative, to, the, dollar, and, fostered, the, rapid, rise, in, the, japanese, trade, surplus, that, took, place, in, the, 1980s, in, 1985, a, dramatic, change, began, finance, officials, from, major, nations, signed, an, agreement, the, plaza, accord, affirming, that, the, dollar, was, overvalued, and, therefore, the, yen, undervalued, this, agreement, and, shifting, supply, and, demand, pressures, in, the, markets, led, to, a, rapid, rise, in, the, value, of, the, yen, from, its, average, of, 239, per, us, in, 1985, the, yen, rose, to, a, peak, of, 128, in, 1988, virtually, doubling, its, value, relative, to, the, dollar, after, declining, somewhat, in, 1989, and, 1990, it, reached, a, new, high, of, 123, to, us, in, december, 1992, in, april, 1995, the, yen, hit, a, peak, of, under, 80, yen, us, temporarily, making, japan, s, economy, nearly, the, size, of, that, of, the, us, the, yen, declined, during, the, japanese, asset, price, bubble, and, continued, to, do, so, afterwards, reaching, a, low, of, 134, to, us, in, february, 2002, the, bank, of, japan, s, policy, of, zero, interest, rates, has, discouraged, yen, investments, with, the, carry, trade, of, investors, borrowing, yen, and, investing, in, better, paying, currencies, thus, further, pushing, down, the, yen, estimated, to, be, as, large, as, 1, trillion, in, february, 2007, the, economist, estimated, that, the, yen, was, 15, undervalued, against, the, dollar, and, as, much, as, 40, undervalued, against, the, euro, however, this, trend, of, depreciation, reversed, after, the, global, economic, crisis, of, 2008, other, major, currencies, except, the, swiss, franc, have, been, declining, relative, to, the, yen, on, april, 4, 2013, the, bank, of, japan, announced, that, they, would, expand, their, asset, purchase, program, by, 1, 4, trillion, in, two, years, the, bank, of, japan, hopes, to, bring, japan, from, deflation, to, inflation, aiming, for, 2, inflation, the, number, of, purchases, is, so, large, that, it, is, expected, to, double, the, money, supply, but, this, move, has, sparked, concerns, that, the, authorities, in, japan, are, deliberately, devaluing, the, yen, to, boost, exports, however, the, commercial, sector, in, japan, worried, that, the, devaluation, would, trigger, an, increase, in, import, prices, especially, for, energy, and, raw, materials, since, 2022, the, yen, has, depreciated, significantly, against, its, peers, due, to, a, variety, of, factors, firstly, japan, s, prolonged, low, interest, rate, policy, to, tackle, domestic, deflation, has, created, a, yield, differential, with, other, countries, notably, the, us, that, have, high, interest, rates, to, tackle, domestic, inflation, prompting, investors, to, seek, higher, returns, in, foreign, currencies, this, interest, rate, differential, directly, affects, the, price, of, the, yen, and, serves, as, one, of, the, drivers, behind, its, depreciation, widely, held, expectations, of, yen, depreciation, can, become, self, fulfilling, prophecies, affecting, the, currency, s, exchange, rate, to, counter, this, the, boj, conducted, currency, interventions, of, more, than, jpy, 9, trillion, selling, the, dollar, and, buying, the, yen, in, the, september, october, 2022, and, april, may, 2024, periods, respectively, numerous, proposals, have, been, made, since, the, 1990s, to, redenominate, the, yen, by, introducing, a, new, unit, or, new, yen, equal, to, 100, yen, and, nearly, worth, one, u, s, dollar, this, has, not, happened, to, date, since, the, yen, remains, trusted, globally, despite, its, low, unit, value, and, due, to, the, huge, costs, of, reissuing, new, currency, and, updating, currency, reading, hardware, the, negative, impact, of, postponing, upgrades, to, various, computer, software, until, redenomination, occurs, in, particular, was, also, cited, the, japan, mint, has, issued, legal, tender, coins, from, 1871, to, the, present, the, obverse, side, of, all, coins, shows, the, coin, s, value, in, kanji, characters, as, well, as, the, country, name, through, 1945, dai, nippon, great, japan, after, 1945, nippon, koku, state, of, japan, except, for, the, current, 5, yen, coin, with, the, country, name, on, the, reverse, the, reverse, side, of, all, coins, shows, the, year, of, mintage, which, is, not, shown, in, gregorian, calendar, years, but, instead, in, the, regnal, year, of, the, current, emperor, s, reign, with, the, first, year, of, an, era, called, gannen, imperial, portraits, have, never, appeared, on, japanese, coins, as, the, image, of, the, emperor, remains, sacred, in, 1897, the, silver, 1, yen, coin, was, demonetized, and, the, sizes, of, the, gold, coins, were, reduced, by, 50, with, 5, 10, and, 20, yen, coins, issued, after, the, war, brass, 50, sen, 1, and, 5, yen, were, introduced, between, 1946, and, 1948, the, current, type, holed, brass, 5, yen, was, introduced, in, 1949, the, bronze, 10, yen, in, 1951, and, the, aluminum, 1, yen, in, 1955, in, 1955, the, first, unholed, nickel, 50, yen, was, introduced, in, 1957, silver, 100, yen, pieces, were, introduced, followed, by, the, holed, 50, yen, coin, in, 1959, these, were, replaced, in, 1967, by, the, current, cupro, nickel, 100, yen, along, with, a, smaller, 50, yen, in, 1982, the, first, cupronickel, 500, yen, coin, was, introduced, alongside, the, 5, swiss, franc, coin, the, 500, yen, coin, is, one, of, the, highest, valued, coin, to, be, used, regularly, in, the, world, with, a, value, of, us, 4, 42, as, of, december, 2016, because, of, its, high, face, value, the, 500, yen, coin, has, been, a, favorite, target, for, counterfeiters, resulting, in, the, issuance, in, 2000, of, the, second, nickel, brass, 500, yen, coin, with, added, security, features, continued, counterfeiting, of, the, latter, resulted, in, the, issuance, in, 2021, of, the, third, bi, metallic, 500, yen, coin, with, more, improvements, in, security, features, due, to, the, great, differences, in, style, size, weight, and, the, pattern, present, on, the, edge, of, the, coin, they, are, easy, for, people, with, visual, impairments, to, tell, apart, from, one, another, commemorative, coins, have, been, minted, on, various, occasions, in, base, metal, silver, and, gold, the, first, of, these, were, silver, 100, and, 1, 000, summer, olympic, coins, issued, for, the, 1964, games, the, largest, issuance, by, denomination, and, total, face, value, were, 10, million, gold, coins, of, 100, 000, denomination, for, the, 60th, anniversary, of, reign, of, the, sh, wa, emperor, in, 1986, totalling, 1, trillion, and, utilizing, 200, 000, kg, fine, gold, 500, commemorative, coins, have, been, regularly, issued, since, 1985, in, 2008, commemorative, 500, and, 1, 000, coins, were, issued, featuring, japan, s, 47, prefectures, even, though, all, commemorative, coins, can, be, spent, like, ordinary, non, commemorative, coins, they, do, not, normally, circulate, and, 100, 000, coins, are, treated, with, caution, due, to, the, discovery, of, counterfeits, the, 1, yen, coin, is, made, out, of, 100, aluminum, and, can, float, on, water, if, placed, correctly, subsidiary, coins, of, sen, one, hundredth, of, a, yen, were, initially, introduced, in, 1870, with, a, silver, alloy, in, denominations, of, 5, 10, 20, and, 50, sen, copper, sen, coins, in, denominations, of, half, 1, and, 2, came, three, years, later, as, japan, acquired, the, technology, needed, to, mint, them, the, removal, of, silver, from, sen, coinage, began, in, 1889, when, cupronickel, 5, sen, coins, were, introduced, by, 1920, this, included, cupro, nickel, 10, sen, and, reduced, size, silver, 50, sen, coins, production, of, the, latter, ceased, in, 1938, after, which, a, variety, of, base, metals, were, used, to, produce, 1, 5, and, 10, sen, coins, during, the, second, world, war, while, clay, 5, and, 10, sen, coins, were, produced, in, 1945, they, were, not, issued, for, circulation, as, with, the, rin, coins, in, denominations, of, less, than, 1, yen, became, invalid, at, the, end, of, 1953, and, were, demonetized, due, to, inflation, bronze, coins, worth, one, one, thousandth, of, a, yen, called, rin, were, first, introduced, in, 1873, one, rin, coins, were, very, small, measuring, 15, 75, mm, in, diameter, and, 0, 3, mm, in, thickness, and, co, circulated, with, mon, coins, of, the, old, currency, system, their, small, size, was, eventually, their, undoing, and, the, rin, was, abandoned, in, 1884, due, to, unpopularity, five, rin, coins, worth, one, two, hundredth, of, a, yen, also, used, a, bronze, alloy, these, were, successor, coins, to, the, equally, valued, half, sen, coin, which, had, been, previously, minted, until, 1888, the, decision, to, bring, back, an, equally, valued, coin, was, in, response, to, rising, inflation, caused, by, world, war, i, which, led, to, an, overall, shortage,
