vowels, so, most, arabic, alphabets, are, abjads, with, the, versions, used, for, some, languages, such, as, kurdish, dialect, of, sorani, uyghur, mandarin, and, bosniak, being, alphabets, it, is, the, basis, for, the, tradition, of, arabic, calligraphy, the, arabic, alphabet, is, derived, either, from, the, nabataean, alphabet, or, less, widely, believed, directly, from, the, syriac, alphabet, which, are, both, derived, from, the, aramaic, alphabet, which, also, gave, rise, to, the, hebrew, alphabet, which, in, turn, descended, from, the, phoenician, alphabet, in, addition, to, the, aramaic, script, and, therefore, the, arabic, and, hebrew, scripts, the, phoenician, script, also, gave, rise, to, the, greek, alphabet, and, therefore, both, the, cyrillic, alphabet, and, the, latin, alphabet, used, in, america, and, most, european, countries, in, the, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bce, northern, arab, tribes, emigrated, and, founded, a, kingdom, centred, around, petra, jordan, these, people, now, named, nabataeans, from, the, name, of, one, of, the, tribes, nabatu, spoke, nabataean, arabic, a, dialect, of, the, arabic, language, in, the, 2nd, or, 1st, centuries, bce, the, first, known, records, of, the, nabataean, alphabet, were, written, in, the, aramaic, language, which, was, the, language, of, communication, and, trade, but, included, some, arabic, language, features, the, nabataeans, did, not, write, the, language, which, they, spoke, they, wrote, in, a, form, of, the, aramaic, alphabet, which, continued, to, evolve, it, separated, into, two, forms, one, intended, for, inscriptions, known, as, monumental, nabataean, and, the, other, more, cursive, and, hurriedly, written, and, with, joined, letters, for, writing, on, papyrus, this, cursive, form, influenced, the, monumental, form, more, and, more, and, gradually, changed, into, the, arabic, alphabet, the, arabic, script, has, been, adapted, for, use, in, a, wide, variety, of, languages, aside, from, arabic, including, persian, malay, and, urdu, which, are, not, semitic, such, adaptations, may, feature, altered, or, new, characters, to, represent, phonemes, that, do, not, appear, in, arabic, phonology, for, example, the, arabic, language, lacks, a, voiceless, bilabial, plosive, the, sound, therefore, many, languages, add, their, own, letter, to, represent, in, the, script, though, the, specific, letter, used, varies, from, language, to, language, these, modifications, tend, to, fall, into, groups, indian, and, turkic, languages, written, in, the, arabic, script, tend, to, use, the, persian,

script, can, therefore, be, used, as, a, true, alphabet, as, well, as, an, abjad, although, it, is, often, strongly, if, erroneously, connected, to, the, latter, due, to, it, being, originally, used, only, for, arabic, use, of, the, arabic, script, in, west, african, languages, especially, in, the, sahel, developed, with, the, spread, of, islam, to, a, certain, degree, the, style, and, usage,

of, sounds, not, represented, in, the, arabic, language, the, term, ajam, which, comes, from, the, arabic, root, for, foreign, has, been, applied, to, arabic, based, orthographies, of, african,
