intellectual, property, ip, is, a, category, of, property, that, includes, intangible, creations, of, the, human, intellect, there, are, many, types, of, intellectual, property, and, some, countries, recognize, more, than, others, the, best, known, types, are, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and, trade, secrets, the, modern, concept, of, intellectual, property, developed, in, england, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, term, intellectual, property, began, to, be, used, in, the, 19th, century, though, it, was, not, until, the, late, 20th, century, that, intellectual, property, became, commonplace, in, most, of, the, world, s, legal, systems, supporters, of, intellectual, property, laws, often, describe, their, main, purpose, as, encouraging, the, creation, of, a, wide, variety, of, intellectual, goods, to, achieve, this, the, law, gives, people, and, businesses, property, rights, to, certain, information, and, intellectual, goods, they, create, usually, for, a, limited, period, of, time, supporters, argue, that, because, ip, laws, allow, people, to, protect, their, original, ideas, and, prevent, unauthorized, copying, creators, derive, greater, individual, economic, benefit, from, the, information, and, intellectual, goods, they, create, and, thus, have, more, economic, incentives, to, create, them, in, the, first, place, advocates, of, ip, believe, that, these, economic, incentives, and, legal, protections, stimulate, innovation, and, contribute, to, technological, progress, of, certain, kinds, the, intangible, nature, of, intellectual, property, presents, difficulties, when, compared, with, traditional, property, like, land, or, goods, unlike, traditional, property, intellectual, property, is, indivisible, since, an, unlimited, number, of, people, can, in, theory, consume, an, intellectual, good, without, its, being, depleted, additionally, investments, in, intellectual, goods, suffer, from, appropriation, problems, landowners, can, surround, their, land, with, a, robust, fence, and, hire, armed, guards, to, protect, it, but, producers, of, information, or, literature, can, usually, do, little, to, stop, their, first, buyer, from, replicating, it, and, selling, it, at, a, lower, price, balancing, rights, so, that, they, are, strong, enough, to, encourage, the, creation, of, intellectual, goods, but, not, so, strong, that, they, prevent, the, goods, wide, use, is, the, primary, focus, of, modern, intellectual, property, law, the, venetian, patent, statute, of, march, 19, 1474, established, by, the, republic, of, venice, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, earliest, codified, patent, system, in, the, world, it, states, that, patents, might, be, granted, for, any, new, and, ingenious, device, not, previously, made, provided, it, was, useful, by, and, large, these, principles, still, remain, the, basic, principles, of, current, patent, laws, the, statute, of, monopolies, 1624, and, the, british, statute, of, anne, 1710, are, seen, as, the, origins, of, the, current, patent, law, and, copyright, respectively, firmly, establishing, the, concept, of, intellectual, property, literary, property, was, the, term, predominantly, used, in, the, british, legal, debates, of, the, 1760s, and, 1770s, over, the, extent, to, which, authors, and, publishers, of, works, also, had, rights, deriving, from, the, common, law, of, property, millar, v, taylor, 1769, hinton, v, donaldson, 1773, donaldson, v, becket, 1774, the, first, known, use, of, the, term, intellectual, property, dates, to, this, time, when, a, piece, published, in, the, monthly, review, in, 1769, used, the, phrase, the, first, clear, example, of, modern, usage, goes, back, as, early, as, 1808, when, it, was, used, as, a, heading, title, in, a, collection, of, essays, the, german, equivalent, was, used, with, the, founding, of, the, north, german, confederation, whose, constitution, granted, legislative, power, over, the, protection, of, intellectual, property, schutz, des, geistigen, eigentums, to, the, confederation, when, the, administrative, secretariats, established, by, the, paris, convention, 1883, and, the, berne, convention, 1886, merged, in, 1893, they, located, in, berne, and, also, adopted, the, term, intellectual, property, in, their, new, combined, title, the, united, international, bureaux, for, the, protection, of, intellectual, property, the, organization, subsequently, relocated, to, geneva, in, 1960, and, was, succeeded, in, 1967, with, the, establishment, of, the, world, intellectual, property, organization, wipo, by, treaty, as, an, agency, of, the, united, nations, according, to, legal, scholar, mark, lemley, it, was, only, at, this, point, that, the, term, really, began, to, be, used, in, the, united, states, which, had, not, been, a, party, to, the, berne, convention, and, it, did, not, enter, popular, usage, there, until, passage, of, the, bayh, dole, act, in, 1980, the, history, of, patents, does, not, begin, with, inventions, but, rather, with, royal, grants, by, queen, elizabeth, i, 1558, 1603, for, monopoly, privileges, approximately, 200, years, after, the, end, of, elizabeth, s, reign, however, a, patent, represents, a, legal, right, obtained, by, an, inventor, providing, for, exclusive, control, over, the, production, and, sale, of, his, mechanical, or, scientific, invention, demonstrating, the, evolution, of, patents, from, royal, prerogative, to, common, law, doctrine, the, term, can, be, found, used, in, an, october, 1845, massachusetts, circuit, court, ruling, in, the, patent, case, davoll, et, al, v, brown, in, which, justice, charles, l, woodbury, wrote, that, only, in, this, way, can, we, protect, intellectual, property, the, labors, of, the, mind, productions, and, interests, are, as, much, a, man, s, own, as, the, wheat, he, cultivates, or, the, flocks, he, rears, the, statement, that, discoveries, are, property, goes, back, earlier, section, 1, of, the, french, law, of, 1791, stated, all, new, discoveries, are, the, property, of, the, author, to, assure, the, inventor, the, property, and, temporary, enjoyment, of, his, discovery, there, shall, be, delivered, to, him, a, patent, for, five, ten, or, fifteen, years, in, europe, french, author, a, nion, mentioned, propri, t, intellectuelle, in, his, droits, civils, des, auteurs, artistes, et, inventeurs, published, in, 1846, until, recently, the, purpose, of, intellectual, property, law, was, to, give, as, little, protection, as, possible, in, order, to, encourage, innovation, historically, therefore, legal, protection, was, granted, only, when, necessary, to, encourage, invention, and, it, was, limited, in, time, and, scope, this, is, mainly, as, a, result, of, knowledge, being, traditionally, viewed, as, a, public, good, in, order, to, allow, its, extensive, dissemination, and, improvement, the, concept, s, origin, can, potentially, be, traced, back, further, jewish, law, includes, several, considerations, whose, effects, are, similar, to, those, of, modern, intellectual, property, laws, though, the, notion, of, intellectual, creations, as, property, does, not, seem, to, exist, notably, the, principle, of, hasagat, ge, vul, unfair, encroachment, was, used, to, justify, limited, term, publisher, but, not, author, copyright, in, the, 16th, century, in, 500, bce, the, government, of, the, greek, state, of, sybaris, offered, one, year, s, patent, to, all, who, should, discover, any, new, refinement, in, luxury, according, to, jean, fr, d, ric, morin, the, global, intellectual, property, regime, is, currently, in, the, midst, of, a, paradigm, shift, indeed, up, until, the, early, 2000s, the, global, ip, regime, used, to, be, dominated, by, high, standards, of, protection, characteristic, of, ip, laws, from, europe, or, the, united, states, with, a, vision, that, uniform, application, of, these, standards, over, every, country, and, to, several, fields, with, little, consideration, over, social, cultural, or, environmental, values, or, of, the, national, level, of, economic, development, morin, argues, that, the, emerging, discourse, of, the, global, ip, regime, advocates, for, greater, policy, flexibility, and, greater, access, to, knowledge, especially, for, developing, countries, indeed, with, the, development, agenda, adopted, by, wipo, in, 2007, a, set, of, 45, recommendations, to, adjust, wipo, s, activities, to, the, specific, needs, of, developing, countries, and, aim, to, reduce, distortions, especially, on, issues, such, as, patients, access, to, medicines, internet, users, access, to, information, farmers, access, to, seeds, programmers, access, to, source, codes, or, students, access, to, scientific, articles, however, this, paradigm, shift, has, not, yet, manifested, itself, in, concrete, legal, reforms, at, the, international, level, similarly, it, is, based, on, these, background, that, the, trade, related, aspects, of, intellectual, property, rights, trips, agreement, requires, members, of, the, wto, to, set, minimum, standards, of, legal, protection, but, its, objective, to, have, a, one, fits, all, protection, law, on, intellectual, property, has, been, viewed, with, controversies, regarding, differences, in, the, development, level, of, countries, despite, the, controversy, the, agreement, has, extensively, incorporated, intellectual, property, rights, into, the, global, trading, system, for, the, first, time, in, 1995, and, has, prevailed, as, the, most, comprehensive, agreement, reached, by, the, world, intellectual, property, rights, include, patents, copyright, industrial, design, rights, trademarks, plant, variety, rights, trade, dress, geographical, indications, and, in, some, jurisdictions, trade, secrets, there, are, also, more, specialized, or, derived, varieties, of, sui, generis, exclusive, rights, such, as, circuit, design, rights, called, mask, work, rights, in, the, us, supplementary, protection, certificates, for, pharmaceutical, products, after, expiry, of, a, patent, protecting, them, and, database, rights, in, european, law, the, term, industrial, property, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, a, large, subset, of, intellectual, property, rights, including, patents, trademarks, industrial, designs, utility, models, service, marks, trade, names, and, geographical, indications, a, patent, is, a, form, of, right, granted, by, the, government, to, an, inventor, or, their, successor, in, title, giving, the, owner, the, right, to, exclude, others, from, making, using, selling, offering, to, sell, and, importing, an, invention, for, a, limited, period, of, time, in, exchange, for, the, public, disclosure, of, the, invention, an, invention, is, a, solution, to, a, specific, technological, problem, which, may, be, a, product, or, a, process, and, generally, has, to, fulfill, three, main, requirements, it, has, to, be, new, not, obvious, and, there, needs, to, be, an, industrial, applicability, 17, to, enrich, the, body, of, knowledge, and, to, stimulate, innovation, it, is, an, obligation, for, patent, owners, to, disclose, valuable, information, about, their, inventions, to, the, public, a, copyright, gives, the, creator, of, an, original, work, exclusive, rights, to, it, usually, for, a, limited, time, copyright, may, apply, to, a, wide, range, of, creative, intellectual, or, artistic, forms, or, works, copyright, does, not, cover, ideas, and, information, themselves, only, the, form, or, manner, in, which, they, are, expressed, an, industrial, design, right, sometimes, called, design, right, or, design, patent, protects, the, visual, design, of, objects, that, are, not, purely, utilitarian, an, industrial, design, consists, of, the, creation, of, a, shape, configuration, or, composition, of, pattern, or, color, or, combination, of, pattern, and, color, in, three, dimensional, form, containing, aesthetic, value, an, industrial, design, can, be, a, two, or, three, dimensional, pattern, used, to, produce, a, product, industrial, commodity, or, handicraft, generally, speaking, it, is, what, makes, a, product, look, appealing, and, as, such, it, increases, the, commercial, value, of, goods, plant, breeders, rights, or, plant, variety, rights, are, the, rights, to, commercially, use, a, new, variety, of, a, plant, the, variety, must, amongst, others, be, novel, and, distinct, and, for, registration, the, evaluation, of, propagating, material, of, the, variety, is, considered, a, trademark, is, a, recognizable, sign, design, or, expression, that, distinguishes, a, particular, trader, s, products, or, services, from, similar, products, or, services, of, other, traders, trade, dress, is, a, legal, term, of, art, that, generally, refers, to, characteristics, of, the, visual, and, aesthetic, appearance, of, a, product, or, its, packaging,

of, information, which, is, not, generally, known, or, reasonably, ascertainable, by, which, a, business, can, obtain, an, economic, advantage, over, competitors, and, customers, there, is, no, formal, government, protection, granted, each, business, must, take, measures, to, guard, its, own, trade, secrets, e, g, formula, of, its, soft, drinks, is, a, trade, secret, for, coca, cola, the, main, purpose, of, intellectual, property, law, is, to, encourage, the, creation, of, a, wide, variety, of, intellectual, goods, for, consumers, to, achieve, this, the, law, gives, people, and, businesses, property, rights, to, the, information, and, intellectual, goods, they, create, usually, for, a, limited, period, of, time, because, they, can, then, profit, from, them, this, gives,

an, incentive, is, created, for, inventors, and, authors, to, create, and, disclose, their, work, some, commentators, have, noted, that, the, objective, of, intellectual, property, legislators, and, those, who, support, its, implementation, appears, to, be, absolute, protection, if, some, intellectual, property, is, desirable, because, it, encourages, innovation, they, reason, more, is, better, the, thinking, is, that, creators, will, not, have, sufficient, incentive, to, invent, unless, they, are, legally, entitled, to, capture, the, full, social, value, of, their, inventions, this, absolute, protection, or, full, value, view, treats, intellectual, property, as, another, type, of, real, property, typically, adopting, its, law, and, rhetoric, other, recent, developments, in, intellectual, property, law, such, as, the, america, invents, act, stress, international, harmonization, recently, there, has, also, been, much, debate, over, the, desirability, of, using, intellectual, property, rights, to, protect, cultural, heritage, including, intangible, ones, as, well, as, over, risks, of, commodification, derived, from, this, possibility, the, issue, still, remains, open, in, legal, scholarship, these, exclusive, rights, allow, intellectual, property, owners, to, benefit, from, the, property, they, have, created, providing, a, financial, incentive, for, the, creation, of, an, investment, in, intellectual, property, and, in, case, of, patents, pay, associated, research, and, development, costs, in, the, united, states, article, i, section, 8, clause, 8, of, the, constitution, commonly, called, the, patent, and, copyright, clause, reads, the, congress, shall, have, power, to, promote, the, progress, of, science, and, useful, arts, by, securing, for, limited, times, to, authors, and, inventors, the, exclusive, right, to, their, respective, writings, and, discoveries, some, commentators, such, as, david, levine, and, michele, boldrin, dispute, this, justification, in, 2013, the, united, states, patent, trademark, office, approximated, that, the, worth, of, intellectual, property, to, the, u, s, economy, is, more, than, us, 5, trillion, and, creates, employment, for, an, estimated, 18, million, american, people, the, value, of, intellectual, property, is, considered, similarly, high, in, other, developed, nations, such, as, those, in, the, european, union, in, the, uk, ip, has, become, a, recognised, asset, class, for, use, in, pension, led, funding, and, other, types, of, business, finance, however, in, 2013, the, uk, intellectual, property, office, stated, there, are, millions, of, intangible, business, assets, whose, value, is, either, not, being, leveraged, at, all, or, only, being, leveraged, inadvertently, an, october, 2023, study, released, by, americans, for, the, arts, afta, found, that, nonprofit, arts, and, culture, organizations, and, their, audiences, generated, 151, 7, billion, in, economic, activity, 73, 3, billion, in, spending, by, the, organizations, which, leveraged, an, additional, 78, 4, billion, in, event, related, spending, by, their, audiences, this, spending, supported, 2, 6, million, jobs, and, generated, 29, 1, billion, in, local, state, and, federal, tax, revenue, 224, 000, audience, members, and, over, 16, 000, organizations, in, all, 50, states, and, puerto, rico, were, surveyed, over, an, 18, month, period, to, collect, the, data, the, wipo, treaty, and, several, related, international, agreements, underline, that, the, protection, of, intellectual, property, rights, is, essential, to, maintaining, economic, growth, the, wipo, intellectual, property, handbook, gives, two, reasons, for, intellectual, property, laws, one, is, to, give, statutory, expression, to, the, moral, and, economic, rights, of, creators, in, their, creations, and, the, rights, of, the, public, in, access, to, those, creations, the, second, is, to, promote, as, a, deliberate, act, of, government, policy, creativity, and, the, dissemination, and, application, of, its, results, and, to, encourage, fair, trading, which, would, contribute, to, economic, and, social, development, the, anti, counterfeiting, trade, agreement, acta, states, that, effective, enforcement, of, intellectual, property, rights, is, critical, to, sustaining, economic, growth, across, all, industries, and, globally, economists, estimate, that, two, thirds, of, the, value, of, large, businesses, in, the, united, states, can, be, traced, to, intangible, assets, ip, intensive, industries, are, estimated, to, generate, 72, more, value, added, price, minus, material, cost, per, employee, than, non, ip, intensive, industries, a, joint, research, project, of, the, wipo, and, the, united, nations, university, measuring, the, impact, of, ip, systems, on, six, asian, countries, found, a, positive, correlation, between, the, strengthening, of, the, ip, system, and, subsequent, economic, growth, according, to, article, 27, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, everyone, has, the, right, to, the, protection, of, the, moral, and, material, interests, resulting, from, any, scientific, literary, or, artistic, production, of, which, he, is, the, author, although, the, relationship, between, intellectual, property, and, human, rights, is, complex, there, are, moral, arguments, for, intellectual, property, the, arguments, that, justify, intellectual, property, fall, into, three, major, categories, personality, theorists, believe, intellectual, property, is, an, extension, of, an, individual, utilitarians, believe, that, intellectual, property, stimulates, social, progress, and, pushes, people, to, further, innovation, lockeans, argue, that, intellectual, property, is, justified, based, on, deservedness, and, hard, work, various, moral, justifications, for, private, property, can, be, used, to, argue, in, favor, of, the, morality, of, intellectual, property, such, as, lysander, spooner, 1855, argues, that, a, man, has, a, natural, and, absolute, right, and, if, a, natural, and, absolute, then, necessarily, a, perpetual, right, of, property, in, the, ideas, of, which, he, is, the, discoverer, or, creator, that, his, right, of, property, in, ideas, is, intrinsically, the, same, as, and, stands, on, identically, the, same, grounds, with, his, right, of, property, in, material, things, that, no, distinction, of, principle, exists, between, the, two, cases, writer, ayn, rand, argued, in, her, book, capitalism, the, unknown, ideal, that, the, protection, of, intellectual, property, is, essentially, a, moral, issue, the, belief, is, that, the, human, mind, itself, is, the, source, of, wealth, and, survival, and, that, all, property, at, its, base, is, intellectual, property, to, violate, intellectual, property, is, therefore, no, different, morally, than, violating, other, property, rights, which, compromises, the, very, processes, of, survival, and, therefore, constitutes, an, immoral, act, violation, of, intellectual, property, rights, called, infringement, with, respect, to, patents, copyright, and, trademarks, and, misappropriation, with, respect, to, trade, secrets, may, be, a, breach, of, civil, law, or, criminal, law, depending, on, the, type, of, intellectual, property, involved, jurisdiction, and, the, nature, of, the, action, as, of, 2011, trade, in, counterfeit, copyrighted, and, trademarked, works, was, a, 600, billion, industry, worldwide, and, accounted, for, 5, 7, of, global, trade, during, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, ip, has, been, a, consideration, in, punishment, of, the, aggressor, through, trade, sanctions, has, been, proposed, as, a, method, to, prevent, future, wars, of, aggression, involving, nuclear, weapons, and, has, caused, concern, about, stifling, innovation, by, keeping, patent, information, secret, patent, infringement, typically, is, caused, by, using, or, selling, a, patented, invention, without, permission, from, the, patent, holder, i, e, from, the, patent, owner, the, scope, of, the, patented, invention, or, the, extent, of, protection, is, defined, in, the, claims, of, the, granted, patent, there, is, safe, harbor, in, many, jurisdictions, to, use, a, patented, invention, for, research, this, safe, harbor, does, not, exist, in, the, us, unless, the, research, is, done, for, purely, philosophical, purposes, or, to, gather, data, to, prepare, an, application, for, regulatory, approval, of, a, drug, in, general, patent, infringement, cases, are, handled, under, civil, law, e, g, in, the, united, states, but, several, jurisdictions, incorporate, infringement, in, criminal, law, also, for, example, argentina, china, france, japan, russia, south, korea, copyright, infringement, is, reproducing, distributing, displaying, or, performing, a, work, or, to, make, derivative, works, without, permission, from, the, copyright, holder, which, is, typically, a, publisher, or, other, business, representing, or, assigned, by, the, work, s, creator, it, is, often, called, piracy, in, the, united, states, while, copyright, is, created, the, instant, a, work, is, fixed, generally, the, copyright, holder, can, only, get, money, damages, if, the, owner, registers, the, copyright, enforcement, of, copyright, is, generally, the, responsibility, of, the, copyright, holder, the, acta, trade, agreement, signed, in, may, 2011, by, the, united, states, japan, switzerland, and, the, eu, and, which, has, not, entered, into, force, requires, that, its, parties, add, criminal, penalties, including, incarceration, and, fines, for, copyright, and, trademark, infringement, and, obligated, the, parties, to, actively, police, for, infringement, there, are, limitations, and, exceptions, to, copyright, allowing, limited, use, of, copyrighted, works, which, does, not, constitute, infringement, examples, of, such, doctrines, are, the, fair, use, and, fair, dealing, doctrine, trademark, infringement, occurs, when, one, party, uses, a, trademark, that, is, identical, or, confusingly, similar, to, a, trademark, owned, by, another, party, in, relation, to, products, or, services, which, are, identical, or, similar, to, the, products, or, services, of, the, other, party, in, many, countries, a, trademark, receives, protection, without, registration, but, registering, a, trademark, provides, legal, advantages, for, enforcement, infringement, can, be, addressed, by, civil, litigation, and, in, several, jurisdictions, under, criminal, law, trade, secret, misappropriation, is, different, from, violations, of, other, intellectual, property, laws, since, by, definition, trade, secrets, are, secret, while, patents, and, registered, copyrights, and, trademarks, are, publicly, available, in, the, united, states, trade, secrets, are, protected, under, state, law, and, states, have, nearly, universally, adopted, the, uniform, trade, secrets, act, the, united, states, also, has, federal, law, in, the, form, of, the, economic, espionage, act, of, 1996, 18, u, s, c, 1831, 1839, which, makes, the, theft, or, misappropriation, of, a, trade, secret, a, federal, crime, this, law, contains, two, provisions, criminalizing, two, sorts, of, activity, the, first, 18, u, s, c, 1831, a, criminalizes, the, theft, of, trade, secrets, to, benefit, foreign, powers, the, second, 18, u, s, c, 1832, criminalizes, their, theft, for, commercial, or, economic, purposes, the, statutory, penalties, are, different, for, the, two, offenses, in, commonwealth, common, law, jurisdictions, confidentiality, and, trade, secrets, are, regarded, as, an, equitable, right, rather, than, a, property, right, but, penalties, for, theft, are, roughly, the, same, as, in, the, united, states, the, international, governance, of, ip, involves, multiple, overlapping, institutions, and, forums, 25, there, is, no, overall, rule, making, body, 25, one, of, the, most, important, aspects, of, global, ip, governance, is, the, agreement, on, trade, related, aspects, of, intellectual, property, rights, trips, 7, the, trips, agreement, sets, minimum, international, standards, for, ip, which, every, member, of, the, world, trade, organization, wto, must, comply, with, 7, a, member, s, non,

requirements, above, the, requirements, of, the, trips, agreement, 7, criticism, of, the, term, intellectual, property, ranges, from, discussing, its, vagueness, and, abstract, overreach, to, direct, contention, to, the, semantic, validity, of, using, words, like, property, and, rights, in, fashions, that, contradict, practice, and, law, many, detractors, think, this, term, specially, serves, the, doctrinal, agenda, of, parties, opposing, reform, in, the, public, interest, or, otherwise, abusing, related, legislations, and, that, it, disallows, intelligent, discussion, about, specific, and, often, unrelated, aspects, of, copyright, patents, trademarks, etc, free, software, foundation, founder, richard, stallman, argues, that, although, the, term, intellectual, property, is, in, wide, use, it, should, be, rejected, altogether, because, it, systematically, distorts, and, confuses, these, issues, and, its, use, was, and, is, promoted, by, those, who, gain, from, this, confusion, he, claims, that, the, term, operates, as, a, catch, all, to, lump, together, disparate, laws, originated, separately, evolved, differently, cover, different, activities, have, different, rules, and, raise, different, public, policy, issues, and, that, it, creates, a, bias, by, confusing, these, monopolies, with, ownership, of, limited, physical, things, likening, them, to, property, rights, stallman, advocates, referring, to, copyrights, patents, and, trademarks, in, the, singular, and, warns, against, abstracting, disparate, laws, into, a, collective, term, he, argues, that, to, avoid, spreading, unnecessary, bias, and, confusion, it, is, best, to, adopt, a, firm, policy, not, to, speak, or, even, think, in, terms, of, intellectual, property, similarly, economists, boldrin, and, levine, prefer, to, use, the, term, intellectual, monopoly, as, a, more, appropriate, and, clear, definition, of, the, concept, which, they, argue, is, very, dissimilar, from, property, rights, they, further, argued, that, stronger, patents, do, little, or, nothing, to, encourage, innovation, mainly, explained, by, its, tendency, to, create, market, monopolies, thereby, restricting, further, innovations, and, technology, transfer, on, the, assumption, that, intellectual, property, rights, are, actual, rights, stallman, says, that, this, claim, does, not, live, to, the, historical, intentions, behind, these, laws, which, in, the, case, of, copyright, served, as, a, censorship, system, and, later, on, a, regulatory, model, for, the, printing, press, that, may, have, benefited, authors, incidentally, but, never, interfered, with, the, freedom, of, average, readers, still, referring, to, copyright, he, cites, legal, literature, such, as, the, united, states, constitution, and, case, law, to, demonstrate, that, the, law, is, meant, to, be, an, optional, and, experimental, bargain, to, temporarily, trade, property, rights, and, free, speech, for, public, not, private, benefits, in, the, form, of, increased, artistic, production, and, knowledge, he, mentions, that, if, copyright, were, a, natural, right, nothing, could, justify, terminating, this, right, after, a, certain, period, of, time, law, professor, writer, and, political, activist, lawrence, lessig, along, with, many, other, copyleft, and, free, software, activists, has, criticized, the, implied, analogy, with, physical, property, like, land, or, an, automobile, they, argue, such, an, analogy, fails, because, physical, property, is, generally, rivalrous, while, intellectual, works, are, non, rivalrous, that, is, if, one, makes, a, copy, of, a, work, the, enjoyment, of, the, copy, does, not, prevent, enjoyment, of, the, original, other, arguments, along, these, lines, claim, that, unlike, the, situation, with, tangible, property, there, is, no, natural, scarcity, of, a, particular, idea, or, information, once, it, exists, at, all, it, can, be, re, used, and, duplicated, indefinitely, without, such, re, use, diminishing, the, original, stephan, kinsella, has, objected, to, intellectual, property, on, the, grounds, that, the, word, property, implies, scarcity, which, may, not, be, applicable, to, ideas, entrepreneur, and, politician, rickard, falkvinge, and, hacker, alexandre, oliva, have, independently, compared, george, orwell, s, fictional, dialect, newspeak, to, the, terminology, used, by, intellectual, property, supporters, as, a, linguistic, weapon, to, shape, public, opinion, regarding, copyright, debate, and, digital, rights, management, drm, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, intellectual, property, has, often, been, referred, to, as, intellectual, rights, traditionally, a, somewhat, broader, concept, that, has, included, moral, rights, and, other, personal, protections, that, cannot, be, bought, or, sold, use, of, the, term, intellectual, rights, has, declined, since, the, early, 1980s, as, use, of, the, term, intellectual, property, has, increased, alternative, terms, monopolies, on, information, and, intellectual, monopoly, have, emerged, among, those, who, argue, against, the, property, or, intellect, or, rights, assumptions, notably, richard, stallman, the, backronyms, intellectual, protectionism, and, intellectual, poverty, whose, initials, are, also, ip, have, also, found, supporters, especially, among, those, who, have, used, the, backronym, digital, restrictions, management, the, argument, that, an, intellectual, property, right, should, in, the, interests, of, better, balancing, of, relevant, private, and, public, interests, be, termed, an, intellectual, monopoly, privilege, imp, has, been, advanced, by, several, academics, including, birgitte, andersen, and, thomas, alured, faunce, some, critics, of, intellectual, property, such, as, those, in, the, free, culture, movement, point, at, intellectual, monopolies, as, harming, health, in, the, case, of, pharmaceutical, patents, preventing, progress, and, benefiting, concentrated, interests, to, the, detriment, of, the, masses, and, argue, that, ever, expansive, monopolies, in, the, form, of, copyright, extensions, software, patents, and, business, method, patents, harm, the, public, interest, more, recently, scientists, and, engineers, are, expressing, concern, that, patent, thickets, are, undermining, technological, development, even, in, high, tech, fields, like, nanotechnology, petra, moser, has, asserted, that, historical, analysis, suggests, that, intellectual, property, laws, may, harm, innovation, overall, the, weight, of, the, existing, historical, evidence, suggests, that, patent, policies, which, grant, strong, intellectual, property, rights, to, early, generations, of, inventors, may, discourage, innovation, on, the, contrary, policies, that, encourage, the, diffusion, of, ideas, and, modify, patent, laws, to, facilitate, entry, and, encourage, competition, may, be, an, effective, mechanism, to, encourage, innovation, in, support, of, that, argument, j, rg, baten, nicola, bianchi, and, petra, moser, find, historical, evidence, that, especially, compulsory, licensing, which, allows, governments, to, license, patents, without, the, consent, of, patent, owners, encouraged, invention, in, germany, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, increasing, the, threat, of, competition, in, fields, with, low, pre, existing, levels, of, competition, peter, drahos, notes, property, rights, confer, authority, over, resources, when, authority, is, granted, to, the, few, over, resources, on, which, the, many, depend, the, few, gain, power, over, the, goals, of, the, many, this, has, consequences, for, both, political, and, economic, freedom, within, a, society, 13, the, world, intellectual, property, organization, wipo, recognizes, that, conflicts, may, exist, between, respecting, and, implementing, current, intellectual, property, systems, and, other, human, rights, in, 2001, the, un, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, issued, a, document, called, human, rights, and, intellectual, property, that, argued, that, intellectual, property, tends, to, be, governed, by, economic, goals, when, it, should, be, viewed, primarily, as, a, social, product, in, order, to, serve, human, well, being, intellectual, property, systems, must, respect, and, conform, to, human, rights, laws, according, to, the, committee, when, systems, fail, to, do, so, they, risk, infringing, upon, the, human, right, to, food, and, health, and, to, cultural, participation, and, scientific, benefits, in, 2004, the, general, assembly, of, wipo, adopted, the, geneva, declaration, on, the, future, of, the, world, intellectual, property, organization, which, argues, that, wipo, should, focus, more, on, the, needs, of, developing, countries, and, to, view, ip, as, one, of, many, tools, for, development, not, as, an, end, in, itself, ethical, problems, are, most, pertinent, when, socially, valuable, goods, like, life, saving, medicines, are, given, ip, protection, while, the, application, of, ip, rights, can, allow, companies, to, charge, higher, than, the, marginal, cost, of, production, in, order, to, recoup, the, costs, of, research, and, development, the, price, may, exclude, from, the, market, anyone, who, cannot, afford, the, cost, of, the, product, in, this, case, a, life, saving, drug, an, ipr, driven, regime, is, therefore, not, a, regime, that, is, conductive, to, the, investment, of, r, d, of, products, that, are, socially, valuable, to, predominately, poor, populations, 1108, 9, libertarians, have, differing, views, on, intellectual, property, stephan, kinsella, an, anarcho, capitalist, on, the, right, wing, of, libertarianism, argues, against, intellectual, property, because, allowing, property, rights, in, ideas, and, information, creates, artificial, scarcity, and, infringes, on, the, right, to, own, tangible, property, kinsella, uses, the, following, scenario, to, argue, this, point, magine, the, time, when, men, lived, in, caves, one, bright, guy, let, s, call, him, galt, magnon, decides, to, build, a, log, cabin, on, an, open, field, near, his, crops, to, be, sure, this, is, a, good, idea, and, others, notice, it, they, naturally, imitate, galt, magnon, and, they, start, building, their, own, cabins, but, the, first, man, to, invent, a, house, according, to, ip, advocates, would, have, a, right, to, prevent, others, from, building, houses, on, their, own, land, with, their, own, logs, or, to, charge, them, a, fee, if, they, do, build, houses, it, is, plain, that, the, innovator, in, these, examples, becomes, a, partial, owner, of, the, tangible, property, e, g, land, and, logs, of, others, due, not, to, first, occupation, and, use, of, that, property, for, it, is, already, owned, but, due, to, his, coming, up, with, an, idea, clearly, this, rule, flies, in, the, face, of, the, first, user, homesteading, rule, arbitrarily, and, groundlessly, overriding, the, very, homesteading, rule, that, is, at, the, foundation, of, all, property, rights, thomas, jefferson, once, said, in, a, letter, to, isaac, mcpherson, on, 13, august, 1813, if, nature, has, made, any, one, thing, less, susceptible, than, all, others, of, exclusive, property, it, is, the, action, of, the, thinking, power, called, an, idea, which, an, individual, may, exclusively, possess, as, long, as, he, keeps, it, to, himself, but, the, moment, it, is, divulged, it, forces, itself, into, the, possession, of, every, one, and, the, receiver, cannot, dispossess, himself, of, it, its, peculiar, character, too, is, that, no, one, possesses, the, less, because, every, other, possesses, the, whole, of, it, he, who, receives, an, idea, from, me, receives, instruction, himself, without, lessening, mine, as, he, who, lights, his, taper, at, mine, receives, light, without, darkening, me, in, 2005, the, royal, society, of, arts, launched, the, adelphi, charter, aimed, at, creating, an, international, policy, statement, to, frame, how, governments, should, make, balanced, intellectual, property, law, another, aspect, of, current, u, s, intellectual, property, legislation, is, its, focus, on, individual, and, joint, works, thus, copyright, protection, can, only, be, obtained, in, original, works, of, authorship, critics, like, philip, bennet, argue, that, this, does, not, provide, adequate, protection, against, cultural, appropriation, of, indigenous, knowledge, for, which, a, collective, ip, regime, is, needed, intellectual, property, law, has, been, criticized, as, not, recognizing, new, forms, of, art, such, as, the, remix, culture, whose, participants, often, commit, what, technically, constitutes, violations, of, such, laws, creation, works, such, as, anime, music, videos, and, others, or, are, otherwise, subject, to, unnecessary, burdens, and, limitations, which, prevent, them, from, fully, expressing, themselves, 70, other, criticism, of, intellectual, property, law, concerns, the, expansion, of, intellectual, property, both, in, duration, and, in, scope, as, scientific, knowledge, has, expanded, and, allowed, new, industries, to, arise, in, fields, such, as, biotechnology, and, nanotechnology, originators, of, technology, have, sought, ip, protection, for, the, new, technologies, patents, have, been, granted, for, living, organisms, and, in, the, united, states, certain, living, organisms, have, been, patentable, for, over, a, century, the, increase, in, terms, of, protection, is, particularly, seen, in, relation, to, copyright, which, has, recently, been, the, subject, of, serial, extensions, in, the, united, states, and, in, europe, with, no, need, for, registration, or, copyright, notices, this, is, thought, to, have, led, to, an, increase, in, orphan, works, copyrighted, works, for, which, the, copyright, owner, cannot, be, contacted, a, problem, that, has, been, noticed, and, addressed, by, governmental, bodies, around, the, world, also, with, respect, to, copyright, the, american, film, industry, helped, to, change, the, social, construct, of, intellectual, property, via, its, trade, organization, the, motion, picture, association, of, america, mpaa, in, amicus, briefs, in, important, cases, in, lobbying, before, congress, and, in, its, statements, to, the, public, the, mpaa, has, advocated, strong, protection, of, intellectual, property, rights, in, framing, its, presentations, the, association, has, claimed, that, people, are, entitled, to, the, property, that, is, produced, by, their, labor, additionally, congress, s, awareness, of, the, position, of, the, united, states, as, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, films, has, made, it, convenient, to, expand, the, conception, of, intellectual, property, these, doctrinal, reforms, have, further, strengthened, the, industry, lending, the, mpaa, even, more, power, and, authority, the, growth, of, the, internet, and, particularly, distributed, search, engines, like, kazaa, and, gnutella, have, represented, a, challenge, for, copyright, policy, the, recording, industry, association, of, america, in, particular, has, been, on, the, front, lines, of, the, fight, against, copyright, infringement, which, the, industry, calls, piracy, the, industry, has, had, victories, against, some, services, including, a, highly, publicized, case, against, the, file, sharing, company, napster, and, some, people, have, been, prosecuted, for, sharing, files, in, violation, of, copyright, the, electronic, age, has, seen, an, increase, in, the, attempt, to, use, software, based, drm, tools, to, restrict, the, copying, and, use, of, digitally, based, works, laws, such, as, the, digital, millennium, copyright, act, have, been, enacted, that, use, criminal, law, to, prevent, any, circumvention, of, software, used, to, enforce, drm, systems, equivalent, provisions, to, prevent, circumvention, of, copyright, protection, have, existed, in, eu, for, some, time, and, are, being, expanded, in, for, example, article, 6, and, 7, the, copyright, directive, other, examples, are, article, 7, of, the, software, directive, of, 1991, 91, 250, eec, and, the, conditional, access, directive, of, 1998, 98, 84, eec, this, can, hinder, legal, uses, affecting, public, domain, works, limitations, and, exceptions, to, copyright, or, uses, allowed, by, the, copyright, holder, some, copyleft, licenses, like, the, gnu, gpl, 3, are, designed, to, counter, this, laws, may, permit, circumvention, under, specific, conditions, such, as, when, it, is, necessary, to, achieve, interoperability, with, the, circumventor, s, program, or, for, accessibility, reasons, however, distribution, of, circumvention, tools, or, instructions, may, be, illegal, in, the, context, of, trademarks, this, expansion, has, been, driven, by, international, efforts, to, harmonise, the, definition, of, trademark, as, exemplified, by, the, agreement, on, trade, related, aspects, of, intellectual, property, rights, ratified, in, 1994, which, formalized, regulations, for, ip, rights, that, had, been, handled, by, common, law, or, not, at, all, in, member, states, pursuant, to, trips, any, sign, which, is, capable, of, distinguishing, the, products, or, services, of, one, business,

covered, by, intellectual, property, rights, according, to, the, world, intellectual, property, organization, women, composed, only, 16, 5, of, patent, holders, even, as, recently, as, 2020, this, disparity, is, the, result, of, several, factors, including, systemic, bias, sexism, and, discrimination, within, the, intellectual, property, space, underrepresentation, within, stem, and, barriers, to, access, of, necessary, finance, and, knowledge, in, order, to, obtain, intellectual, property, rights, among, other, reasons, the, global, increase, in, intellectual, property, protection, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, global, ip, ratchet, in, which, a, spiral, of, bilateral, and, multilateral, agreements, result, in, growing, obligations, where, new, agreements, never, recede, from,
