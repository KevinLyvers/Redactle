a, famine, is, a, widespread, scarcity, of, food, caused, by, several, possible, factors, including, but, not, limited, to, war, natural, disasters, crop, failure, widespread, poverty, an, economic, catastrophe, or, government, policies, this, phenomenon, is, usually, accompanied, or, followed, by, regional, malnutrition, starvation, epidemic, and, increased, mortality, every, inhabited, continent, in, the, world, has, experienced, a, period, of, famine, throughout, history, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, southeast, and, south, asia, as, well, as, eastern, and, central, europe, suffered, the, greatest, number, of, fatalities, deaths, caused, by, famine, declined, sharply, beginning, in, the, 1970s, with, numbers, falling, further, since, 2000, since, 2010, africa, has, been, the, most, affected, continent, in, the, world, by, famine, according, to, the, united, nations, world, food, programme, famine, is, declared, when, malnutrition, is, widespread, and, when, people, have, started, dying, of, starvation, through, lack, of, access, to, sufficient, nutritious, food, the, integrated, food, security, phase, classification, criteria, define, phase, 5, famine, of, acute, food, insecurity, as, occurring, when, all, three, of, the, following, situations, exist, at, the, same, time, the, declaration, of, a, famine, carries, no, binding, obligations, on, the, un, or, member, states, but, serves, to, focus, global, attention, on, the, problem, the, cyclical, occurrence, of, famine, has, been, a, mainstay, of, societies, engaged, in, subsistence, agriculture, since, the, dawn, of, agriculture, itself, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, famine, has, fluctuated, throughout, history, depending, on, changes, in, food, demand, such, as, population, growth, and, supply, side, shifts, caused, by, changing, climatic, conditions, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, the, feudal, system, began, to, break, down, and, more, prosperous, farmers, began, to, enclose, their, own, land, and, improve, their, yields, to, sell, the, surplus, crops, for, a, profit, these, capitalist, landowners, paid, their, labourers, with, money, thereby, increasing, the, commercialization, of, rural, society, in, the, emerging, competitive, labour, market, better, techniques, for, the, improvement, of, labour, productivity, were, increasingly, valued, and, rewarded, it, was, in, the, farmer, s, interest, to, produce, as, much, as, possible, on, their, land, in, order, to, sell, it, to, areas, that, demanded, that, product, they, produced, guaranteed, surpluses, of, their, crop, every, year, if, they, could, subsistence, peasants, were, also, increasingly, forced, to, commercialize, their, activities, because, of, increasing, taxes, taxes, that, had, to, be, paid, to, central, governments, in, money, forced, the, peasants, to, produce, crops, to, sell, sometimes, they, produced, industrial, crops, but, they, would, find, ways, to, increase, their, production, in, order, to, meet, both, their, subsistence, requirements, as, well, as, their, tax, obligations, peasants, also, used, the, new, money, to, purchase, manufactured, goods, the, agricultural, and, social, developments, encouraging, increased, food, production, were, gradually, taking, place, throughout, the, 16th, century, but, took, off, in, the, early, 17th, century, by, the, 1590s, these, trends, were, sufficiently, developed, in, the, rich, and, commercialized, province, of, holland, to, allow, its, population, to, withstand, a, general, outbreak, of, famine, in, western, europe, at, that, time, by, that, time, the, netherlands, had, one, of, the, most, commercialized, agricultural, systems, in, europe, they, grew, many, industrial, crops, such, as, flax, hemp, and, hops, agriculture, became, increasingly, specialized, and, efficient, the, efficiency, of, dutch, agriculture, allowed, for, much, more, rapid, urbanization, in, the, late, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, centuries, than, anywhere, else, in, europe, as, a, result, productivity, and, wealth, increased, allowing, the, netherlands, to, maintain, a, steady, food, supply, by, 1650, english, agriculture, had, also, become, commercialized, on, a, much, wider, scale, the, last, peacetime, famine, in, england, was, in, 1623, 24, there, were, still, periods, of, hunger, as, in, the, netherlands, but, no, more, famines, ever, occurred, common, areas, for, pasture, were, enclosed, for, private, use, and, large, scale, efficient, farms, were, consolidated, other, technical, developments, included, the, draining, of, marshes, more, efficient, field, use, patterns, and, the, wider, introduction, of, industrial, crops, these, agricultural, developments, led, to, wider, prosperity, in, england, and, increasing, urbanization, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, english, agriculture, was, the, most, productive, in, europe, in, both, england, and, the, netherlands, the, population, stabilized, between, 1650, and, 1750, the, same, time, period, in, which, the, sweeping, changes, to, agriculture, occurred, famine, still, occurred, in, other, parts, of, europe, however, in, eastern, europe, famines, occurred, as, late, as, the, twentieth, century, because, of, the, severity, of, famine, it, was, a, chief, concern, for, governments, and, other, authorities, in, pre, industrial, europe, preventing, famine, and, ensuring, timely, food, supplies, was, one, of, the, chief, concerns, of, many, governments, although, they, were, severely, limited, in, their, options, due, to, limited, levels, of, external, trade, infrastructure, and, bureaucracy, generally, too, rudimentary, to, effect, real, relief, most, governments, were, concerned, by, famine, because, it, could, lead, to, revolt, and, other, forms, of, social, disruption, by, the, mid, 19th, century, and, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, it, became, possible, for, governments, to, alleviate, the, effects, of, famine, through, price, controls, large, scale, importation, of, food, products, from, foreign, markets, stockpiling, rationing, regulation, of, production, and, charity, the, great, famine, of, 1845, in, ireland, was, one, of, the, first, famines, to, feature, such, intervention, although, the, government, response, was, often, lackluster, the, initial, response, of, the, british, government, to, the, early, phase, of, the, famine, was, prompt, and, relatively, successful, according, to, f, s, l, lyons, confronted, by, widespread, crop, failure, in, the, autumn, of, 1845, prime, minister, sir, robert, peel, purchased, 100, 000, worth, of, maize, and, cornmeal, secretly, from, america, baring, brothers, co, initially, acted, as, purchasing, agents, for, the, prime, minister, the, government, hoped, that, they, would, not, stifle, private, enterprise, and, that, their, actions, would, not, act, as, a, disincentive, to, local, relief, efforts, due, to, weather, conditions, the, first, shipment, did, not, arrive, in, ireland, until, the, beginning, of, february, 1846, the, maize, corn, was, then, re, sold, for, a, penny, a, pound, in, 1846, peel, moved, to, repeal, the, corn, laws, tariffs, on, grain, which, kept, the, price, of, bread, artificially, high, the, famine, situation, worsened, during, 1846, and, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, that, year, did, little, to, help, the, starving, irish, the, measure, split, the, conservative, party, leading, to, the, fall, of, peel, s, ministry, in, march, peel, set, up, a, programme, of, public, works, in, ireland, despite, this, promising, start, the, measures, undertaken, by, peel, s, successor, lord, john, russell, proved, comparatively, inadequate, as, the, crisis, deepened, russell, s, ministry, introduced, public, works, projects, which, by, december, 1846, employed, some, half, million, irish, and, proved, impossible, to, administer, the, government, was, influenced, by, a, laissez, faire, belief, that, the, market, would, provide, the, food, needed, it, halted, government, food, and, relief, works, and, turned, to, a, mixture, of, indoor, and, outdoor, direct, relief, the, former, administered, in, workhouses, through, the, poor, law, the, latter, through, soup, kitchens, a, systematic, attempt, at, creating, the, necessary, regulatory, framework, for, dealing, with, famine, was, developed, by, the, british, raj, in, the, 1880s, in, order, to, comprehensively, address, the, issue, of, famine, the, british, created, an, indian, famine, commission, to, recommend, steps, that, the, government, would, be, required, to, take, in, the, event, of, a, famine, the, famine, commission, issued, a, series, of, government, guidelines, and, regulations, on, how, to, respond, to, famines, and, food, shortages, called, the, famine, code, the, famine, code, was, also, one, of, the, first, attempts, to, scientifically, predict, famine, in, order, to, mitigate, its, effects, these, were, finally, passed, into, law, in, 1883, under, lord, ripon, the, code, introduced, the, first, famine, scale, three, levels, of, food, insecurity, were, defined, near, scarcity, scarcity, and, famine, scarcity, was, defined, as, three, successive, years, of, crop, failure, crop, yields, of, one, third, or, one, half, normal, and, large, populations, in, distress, famine, further, included, a, rise, in, food, prices, above, 140, of, normal, the, movement, of, people, in, search, of, food, and, widespread, mortality, the, commission, identified, that, the, loss, of, wages, from, lack, of, employment, of, agricultural, labourers, and, artisans, were, the, cause, of, famines, the, famine, code, applied, a, strategy, of, generating, employment, for, these, sections, of, the, population, and, relied, on, open, ended, public, works, to, do, so, during, the, 20th, century, an, estimated, 70, to, 120, million, people, died, from, famines, across, the, world, of, whom, over, half, died, in, china, with, an, estimated, 30, million, dying, during, the, famine, of, 1958, 1961, up, to, 10, million, in, the, chinese, famine, of, 1928, 1930, and, over, two, million, in, the, chinese, famine, of, 1942, 1943, and, millions, more, lost, in, famines, in, north, and, east, china, the, ussr, lost, 8, million, claimed, by, the, soviet, famine, of, 1930, 1933, over, a, million, in, both, the, soviet, famine, of, 1946, 1947, and, siege, of, leningrad, the, 5, million, in, the, russian, famine, of, 1921, 1922, and, others, famines, java, suffered, 2, 5, million, deaths, under, japanese, occupation, during, world, war, two, the, other, most, notable, famine, of, the, century, was, the, bengal, famine, of, 1943, resulting, both, from, the, japanese, occupation, of, burma, resulting, in, an, influx, of, refugees, and, blocking, burmese, grain, imports, and, a, failure, of, the, bengali, provincial, government, to, declare, a, famine, and, fund, relief, the, imposition, of, grain, and, transport, embargoes, by, the, neighbouring, provincial, administrations, to, prevent, their, own, stocks, being, transferred, to, bengal, the, failure, to, implement, india, wide, rationing, by, the, central, delhi, authority, hoarding, and, profiteering, by, merchants, medieval, land, management, practices, an, axis, powers, denial, program, that, confiscated, boats, once, used, to, transport, grain, a, delhi, administration, that, prioritised, supplying, and, offering, medical, treatment, to, the, british, indian, army, war, workers, and, civil, servants, over, the, populace, at, large, incompetence, and, ignorance, and, an, imperial, war, cabinet, initially, leaving, the, issue, to, the, colonial, administration, to, resolve, than, to, the, original, local, crop, failures, and, blights, a, few, of, the, great, famines, of, the, late, 20th, century, were, the, biafran, famine, in, the, 1960s, the, khmer, rouge, caused, famine, in, cambodia, in, the, 1970s, the, north, korean, famine, of, the, 1990s, and, the, ethiopian, famine, of, 1983, 1985, approximately, 3, million, died, as, a, consequence, of, the, second, congo, war, the, ethiopian, famine, was, reported, on, television, reports, around, the, world, carrying, footage, of, starving, ethiopians, whose, plight, was, centered, around, a, feeding, station, near, the, town, of, korem, this, stimulated, the, first, mass, movements, to, end, famine, across, the, world, bbc, newsreader, michael, buerk, gave, moving, commentary, of, the, tragedy, on, 23, october, 1984, which, he, described, as, a, biblical, famine, this, prompted, the, band, aid, single, which, was, organized, by, bob, geldof, and, featured, more, than, 20, pop, stars, the, live, aid, concerts, in, london, and, philadelphia, raised, even, more, funds, for, the, cause, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, died, within, one, year, as, a, result, of, the, famine, but, the, publicity, live, aid, generated, encouraged, western, nations, to, make, available, enough, surplus, grain, to, end, the, immediate, hunger, crisis, in, africa, some, of, the, famines, of, the, 20th, century, served, the, geopolitical, purposes, of, governments, including, traumatizing, and, replacing, distrusted, ethnic, populations, in, strategically, important, regions, rendering, regions, vulnerable, to, invasion, difficult, to, govern, by, an, enemy, power, and, shifting, the, burden, of, food, shortage, onto, regions, where, the, distress, of, the, population, posed, a, lesser, risk, of, catastrophic, regime, de, legitimation, until, 2017, worldwide, deaths, from, famine, had, been, falling, dramatically, the, world, peace, foundation, reported, that, from, the, 1870s, to, the, 1970s, great, famines, killed, an, average, of, 928, 000, people, a, year, since, 1980, annual, deaths, had, dropped, to, an, average, of, 75, 000, less, than, 10, of, what, they, had, been, until, the, 1970s, that, reduction, was, achieved, despite, the, approximately, 150, 000, lives, lost, in, the, 2011, somalia, famine, yet, in, 2017, the, un, officially, declared, famine, had, returned, to, africa, with, about, 20, million, people, at, risk, of, death, from, starvation, in, the, northern, part, of, nigeria, in, south, sudan, in, yemen, and, in, somalia, on, 20, april, 2021, hundreds, of, aid, organizations, from, around, the, world, wrote, an, open, letter, to, the, guardian, newspaper, warning, that, millions, of, people, in, yemen, afghanistan, ethiopia, south, sudan, burkina, faso, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, honduras, venezuela, nigeria, haiti, central, african, republic, uganda, zimbabwe, and, sudan, faced, starvation, organizations, including, the, international, council, of, voluntary, agencies, and, the, world, food, programme, said, girls, and, boys, men, and, women, are, being, starved, by, conflict, and, violence, by, inequality, by, the, impacts, of, climate, change, by, the, loss, of, land, jobs, of, prospects, by, a, fight, against, covid, 19, that, has, left, them, even, further, behind, the, groups, warned, that, funding, had, dwindled, while, money, alone, would, not, be, enough, by, itself, governments, should, step, in, to, end, conflicts, and, ensure, humanitarian, access, they, said, if, no, action, is, taken, lives, will, be, lost, the, responsibility, to, address, this, lies, with, states, they, added, in, november, 2021, the, world, food, programme, reported, that, 45, million, people, were, teetering, on, the, very, edge, of, famine, in, 43, countries, and, that, the, slightest, shock, would, push, them, over, the, precipice, this, number, had, risen, from, 42, million, earlier, in, 2021, and, from, 27, million, in, 2019, the, slightest, shock, be, it, extreme, weather, linked, to, climate, change, conflict, or, the, deadly, interplay, of, both, hunger, drivers, could, push, tens, of, millions, of, people, into, irreversible, peril, a, prospect, the, agency, had, been, warning, of, for, more, than, a, year, afghanistan, was, becoming, the, world, s, largest, humanitarian, crisis, with, the, country, s, needs, surpassing, those, of, the, other, worst, hit, countries, ethiopia, south, sudan, syria, and, even, yemen, in, 2023, and, 2024, the, israeli, response, to, the, 2023, hamas, led, attack, on, israel, caused, the, gaza, strip, famine, this, includes, a, full, ban, on, all, shipments, for, a, short, time, after, the, attack, later, extremely, restrictive, security, checks, on, aid, attempting, to, go, through, the, blockade, and, israeli, protesters, blocking, aid, in, the, mid, 22nd, century, bc, a, sudden, and, short, lived, climatic, change, that, caused, reduced, rainfall, resulted, in, several, decades, of, drought, in, upper, egypt, the, resulting, famine, and, civil, strife, is, believed, to, have, been, a, major, cause, of, the, collapse, of, the, old, kingdom, an, account, from, the, first, intermediate, period, states, all, of, upper, egypt, was, dying, of, hunger, and, people, were, eating, their, children, as, for, recorded, examples, pertaining, to, more, recent, centuries, in, the, 1680s, famine, extended, across, the, entire, sahel, and, in, 1738, half, the, population, of, timbuktu, died, of, famine, in, egypt, between, 1687, and, 1731, there, were, six, famines, the, famine, that, afflicted, egypt, in, 1784, cost, it, roughly, one, sixth, of, its, population, the, maghreb, experienced, famine, and, plague, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, century, there, was, famine, in, tripoli, in, 1784, and, in, tunis, in, 1785, according, to, john, iliffe, portuguese, records, of, angola, from, the, 16th, century, show, that, a, great, famine, occurred, on, average, every, seventy, years, accompanied, by, epidemic, disease, it, might, kill, one, third, or, one, half, of, the, population, destroying, the, demographic, growth, of, a, generation, and, forcing, colonists, back, into, the, river, valleys, the, first, documentation, of, weather, in, west, central, africa, occurs, around, the, mid, 16th, to, 17th, centuries, in, areas, such, as, luanda, kongo, however, not, much, data, was, recorded, on, the, issues, of, weather, and, disease, except, for, a, few, notable, documents, the, only, records, obtained, are, of, violence, between, portuguese, and, africans, during, the, battle, of, mbwila, in, 1665, in, these, documents, the, portuguese, wrote, of, african, raids, on, portuguese, merchants, solely, for, food, giving, clear, signs, of, famine, additionally, instances, of, cannibalism, by, the, african, jaga, were, also, more, prevalent, during, this, time, frame, indicating, an, extreme, deprivation, of, a, primary, food, source, a, notable, period, of, famine, occurred, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, congo, free, state, in, forming, this, state, leopold, used, mass, labor, camps, to, finance, his, empire, this, period, resulted, in, the, death, of, up, to, 10, million, congolese, from, brutality, disease, and, famine, some, colonial, pacification, efforts, often, caused, severe, famine, notably, with, the, repression, of, the, maji, maji, revolt, in, tanganyika, in, 1906, the, introduction, of, cash, crops, such, as, cotton, and, forcible, measures, to, impel, farmers, to, grow, these, crops, sometimes, impoverished, the, peasantry, in, many, areas, such, as, northern, nigeria, contributing, to, greater, vulnerability, to, famine, when, severe, drought, struck, in, 1913, a, large, scale, famine, occurred, in, ethiopia, in, 1888, and, succeeding, years, as, the, rinderpest, epizootic, introduced, into, eritrea, by, infected, cattle, spread, southwards, reaching, ultimately, as, far, as, south, africa, in, ethiopia, it, was, estimated, that, as, much, as, 90, percent, of, the, national, herd, died, rendering, rich, farmers, and, herders, destitute, overnight, this, coincided, with, drought, associated, with, an, el, ni, o, oscillation, human, epidemics, of, smallpox, and, in, several, countries, intense, war, the, ethiopian, great, famine, that, afflicted, ethiopia, from, 1888, to, 1892, cost, it, roughly, one, third, of, its, population, in, sudan, the, year, 1888, is, remembered, as, the, worst, famine, in, history, on, account, of, these, factors, and, also, the, exactions, imposed, by, the, mahdist, state, the, oral, traditions, of, the, himba, people, recall, two, droughts, from, 1910, to, 1917, from, 1910, to, 1911, the, himba, described, the, drought, as, drought, of, the, omutati, seed, also, called, omangowi, the, fruit, of, an, unidentified, vine, that, people, ate, during, the, time, period, from, 1914, to, 1916, droughts, brought, katur, ombanda, or, kari, ombanda, the, time, of, eating, clothing, for, the, middle, part, of, the, 20th, century, agriculturalists, economists, and, geographers, did, not, consider, africa, to, be, especially, famine, prone, from, 1870, to, 2010, 87, of, deaths, from, famine, occurred, in, asia, and, eastern, europe, with, only, 9, 2, in, africa, there, were, notable, counter, examples, such, as, the, famine, in, rwanda, during, world, war, ii, and, the, malawi, famine, of, 1949, but, most, famines, were, localized, and, brief, food, shortages, although, the, drought, was, brief, the, main, cause, of, death, in, rwanda, was, due, to, belgian, prerogatives, to, acquisition, grain, from, their, colony, rwanda, the, increased, grain, acquisition, was, related, to, ww2, this, and, the, drought, caused, 300, 000, rwandans, to, perish, from, 1967, to, 1969, large, scale, famine, occurred, in, biafra, and, nigeria, due, to, a, government, blockade, of, the, breakaway, territory, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 5, million, people, died, of, starvation, due, to, this, famine, additionally, drought, and, other, government, interference, with, the, food, supply, caused, 500, thousand, africans, to, perish, in, central, and, west, africa, famine, recurred, in, the, early, 1970s, when, ethiopia, and, the, west, african, sahel, suffered, drought, and, famine, the, ethiopian, famine, of, that, time, was, closely, linked, to, the, crisis, of, feudalism, in, that, country, and, in, due, course, helped, to, bring, about, the, downfall, of, the, emperor, haile, selassie, the, sahelian, famine, was, associated, with, the, slowly, growing, crisis, of, pastoralism, in, africa, which, has, seen, livestock, herding, decline, as, a, viable, way, of, life, over, the, last, two, generations, famines, occurred, in, sudan, in, the, late, 1970s, and, again, in, 1990, and, 1998, the, 1980, famine, in, karamoja, uganda, was, in, terms, of, mortality, rates, one, of, the, worst, in, history, 21, of, the, population, died, including, 60, of, the, infants, in, the, 1980s, large, scale, multilayer, drought, occurred, in, the, sudan, and, sahelian, regions, of, africa, this, caused, famine, because, even, though, the, sudanese, government, believed, there, was, a, surplus, of, grain, there, were, local, deficits, across, the, region, in, october, 1984, television, reports, describing, the, ethiopian, famine, as, biblical, prompted, the, live, aid, concerts, in, london, and, philadelphia, which, raised, large, sums, to, alleviate, the, suffering, a, primary, cause, of, the, famine, one, of, the, largest, seen, in, the, country, is, that, ethiopia, and, the, surrounding, horn, was, still, recovering, from, the, droughts, which, occurred, in, the, mid, late, 1970s, compounding, this, problem, was, the, intermittent, fighting, due, to, civil, war, the, government, s, lack, of, organization, in, providing, relief, and, hoarding, of, supplies, to, control, the, population, ultimately, over, 1, million, ethiopians, died, and, over, 22, million, people, suffered, due, to, the, prolonged, drought, which, lasted, roughly, 2, years, in, 1992, somalia, became, a, war, zone, with, no, effective, government, police, or, basic, services, after, the, collapse, of, the, dictatorship, led, by, siad, barre, and, the, split, of, power, between, warlords, this, coincided, with, a, massive, drought, causing, over, 300, 000, somalis, to, perish, since, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, more, effective, early, warning, and, humanitarian, response, actions, have, reduced, the, number, of, deaths, by, famine, markedly, that, said, many, african, countries, are, not, self, sufficient, in, food, production, relying, on, income, from, cash, crops, to, import, food, agriculture, in, africa, is, susceptible, to, climatic, fluctuations, especially, droughts, which, can, reduce, the, amount, of, food, produced, locally, other, agricultural, problems, include, soil, infertility, land, degradation, and, erosion, swarms, of, desert, locusts, which, can, destroy, whole, crops, and, livestock, diseases, desertification, is, increasingly, problematic, the, sahara, reportedly, spreads, up, to, 48, kilometres, 30, mi, per, year, the, most, serious, famines, have, been, caused, by, a, combination, of, drought, misguided, economic, policies, and, conflict, the, 1983, 85, famine, in, ethiopia, for, example, was, the, outcome, of, all, these, three, factors, made, worse, by, the, communist, government, s, censorship, of, the, emerging, crisis, in, capitalist, sudan, at, the, same, date, drought, and, economic, crisis, combined, with, denials, of, any, food, shortage, by, the, then, government, of, president, gaafar, nimeiry, to, create, a, crisis, that, killed, perhaps, 250, 000, people, and, helped, bring, about, a, popular, uprising, that, overthrew, nimeiry, numerous, factors, make, the, food, security, situation, in, africa, tenuous, including, political, instability, armed, conflict, and, civil, war, corruption, and, mismanagement, in, handling, food, supplies, and, trade, policies, that, harm, african, agriculture, an, example, of, a, famine, created, by, human, rights, abuses, is, the, 1998, sudan, famine, aids, is, also, having, long, term, economic, effects, on, agriculture, by, reducing, the, available, workforce, and, is, creating, new, vulnerabilities, to, famine, by, overburdening, poor, households, on, the, other, hand, in, the, modern, history, of, africa, on, quite, a, few, occasions, famines, acted, as, a, major, source, of, acute, political, instability, in, africa, if, current, trends, of, population, growth, and, soil, degradation, continue, the, continent, might, be, able, to, feed, just, 25, of, its, population, by, 2025, according, to, united, nations, university, unu, s, ghana, based, institute, for, natural, resources, in, africa, recent, famines, in, africa, include, the, 2005, 06, niger, food, crisis, the, 2010, sahel, famine, and, the, 2011, east, africa, drought, where, two, consecutive, missed, rainy, seasons, precipitated, the, worst, drought, in, east, africa, in, 60, years, an, estimated, 50, 000, to, 150, 000, people, are, reported, to, have, died, during, the, period, in, 2012, the, sahel, drought, put, more, than, 10, million, people, in, the, western, sahel, at, risk, of, famine, according, to, a, methodist, relief, development, fund, mrdf, aid, expert, due, to, a, month, long, heat, wave, today, famine, is, most, widespread, in, sub, saharan, africa, but, with, exhaustion, of, food, resources, overdrafting, of, groundwater, wars, internal, struggles, and, economic, failure, famine, continues, to, be, a, worldwide, problem, with, hundreds, of, millions, of, people, suffering, these, famines, cause, widespread, malnutrition, and, impoverishment, the, famine, in, ethiopia, in, the, 1980s, had, an, immense, death, toll, although, asian, famines, of, the, 20th, century, have, also, produced, extensive, death, tolls, modern, african, famines, are, characterized, by, widespread, destitution, and, malnutrition, with, heightened, mortality, confined, to, young, children, against, a, backdrop, of, conventional, interventions, through, the, state, or, markets, alternative, initiatives, have, been, pioneered, to, address, the, problem, of, food, security, one, pan, african, example, is, the, great, green, wall, another, example, is, the, community, area, based, development, approach, to, agricultural, development, cabda, an, ngo, programme, with, the, objective, of, providing, an, alternative, approach, to, increasing, food, security, in, africa, cabda, proceeds, through, specific, areas, of, intervention, such, as, the, introduction, of, drought, resistant, crops, and, new, methods, of, food, production, such, as, agro, forestry, piloted, in, ethiopia, in, the, 1990s, it, has, spread, to, malawi, uganda, eritrea, and, kenya, in, an, analysis, of, the, programme, by, the, overseas, development, institute, cabda, s, focus, on, individual, and, community, capacity, building, is, highlighted, this, enables, farmers, to, influence, and, drive, their, own, development, through, community, run, institutions, bringing, food, security, to, their, household, and, region, the, organization, of, african, unity, and, its, role, in, the, african, crisis, has, been, interested, in, the, political, aspects, of, the, continent, especially, the, liberation, of, the, occupied, parts, of, it, and, the, elimination, of, racism, the, organization, has, succeeded, in, this, area, but, the, economic, field, and, development, has, not, succeeded, in, these, fields, african, leaders, have, agreed, to, waive, the, role, of, their, organization, in, the, development, to, the, united, nations, through, the, economic, commission, for, africa, eca, chinese, scholars, had, kept, count, of, 1, 828, instances, of, famine, from, 108, bc, to, 1911, in, one, province, or, another, an, average, of, more, than, one, famine, per, year, a, major, famine, from, 1333, to, 1337, killed, 6, million, the, four, famines, of, 1810, 1811, 1846, and, 1849, are, said, to, have, killed, no, fewer, than, 45, million, people, china, s, qing, dynasty, bureaucracy, devoted, extensive, attention, to, minimizing, famines, with, a, network, of, granaries, its, famines, generally, occurred, immediately, after, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, linked, droughts, and, floods, these, events, are, comparable, though, somewhat, smaller, in, scale, to, the, ecological, trigger, events, of, china, s, vast, 19th, century, famines, qing, china, carried, out, its, relief, efforts, which, included, vast, shipments, of, food, a, requirement, that, the, rich, open, their, storehouses, to, the, poor, and, price, regulation, as, part, of, a, state, guarantee, of, subsistence, to, the, peasantry, known, as, ming, sheng, however, the, taiping, rebellion, of, the, 1850s, disrupted, the, granary, relief, system, such, that, 1850, to, 1873, saw, the, population, of, china, drop, by, over, 30, million, people, from, early, deaths, and, missing, births, when, a, stressed, monarchy, shifted, from, state, management, and, direct, shipments, of, grain, to, monetary, charity, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, system, broke, down, thus, the, 1867, 68, famine, under, the, tongzhi, restoration, was, successfully, relieved, but, the, great, north, china, famine, of, 1877, 78, caused, by, drought, across, northern, china, was, a, catastrophe, the, province, of, shanxi, was, substantially, depopulated, as, grains, ran, out, and, desperately, starving, people, stripped, forests, fields, and, their, very, houses, for, food, estimated, mortality, is, 9, 5, to, 13, million, people, the, largest, famine, of, the, 20th, century, was, the, 1958, 1961, famine, associated, with, the, great, leap, forward, in, china, the, immediate, causes, of, this, famine, lay, in, mao, zedong, s, ill, fated, attempt, to, transform, china, from, an, agricultural, nation, to, an, industrial, power, in, one, huge, leap, communist, party, cadres, across, china, insisted, that, peasants, abandon, their, farms, for, collective, farms, and, begin, to, produce, steel, in, small, foundries, often, melting, down, their, farm, instruments, in, the, process, collectivisation, undermined, incentives, for, the, investment, of, labor, and, resources, in, agriculture, unrealistic, plans, for, decentralized, metal, production, sapped, needed, labor, unfavorable, weather, conditions, and, communal, dining, halls, encouraged, overconsumption, of, available, food, such, was, the, centralized, control, of, information, and, the, intense, pressure, on, party, cadres, to, report, only, good, news, such, as, production, quotas, met, or, exceeded, that, information, about, the, escalating, disaster, was, effectively, suppressed, when, the, leadership, did, become, aware, of, the, scale, of, the, famine, it, did, little, to, respond, and, continued, to, ban, any, discussion, of, the, cataclysm, this, blanket, suppression, of, news, was, so, effective, that, very, few, chinese, citizens, were, aware, of, the, scale, of, the, famine, and, the, greatest, peacetime, demographic, disaster, of, the, 20th, century, only, became, widely, known, twenty, years, later, when, the, veil, of, censorship, began, to, lift, the, exact, number, of, famine, deaths, during, 1958, 1961, is, difficult, to, determine, and, estimates, range, from, 18, million, to, at, least, 42, million, people, with, a, further, 30, million, cancelled, or, delayed, births, it, was, only, when, the, famine, had, wrought, its, worst, that, mao, reversed, agricultural, collectivisation, policies, which, were, effectively, dismantled, in, 1978, china, has, not, experienced, a, famine, of, the, proportions, of, the, great, leap, forward, since, 1961, japan, experienced, more, than, 130, famines, between, 1603, and, 1868, in, 1975, the, khmer, rouge, took, control, of, cambodia, the, new, government, was, led, by, pol, pot, who, desired, to, turn, cambodia, into, a, communist, agrarian, utopia, his, regime, emptied, the, cities, abolished, currency, and, private, property, and, forced, cambodia, s, population, into, slavery, on, communal, farms, in, less, than, four, years, the, khmer, rouge, had, executed, nearly, 1, 4, million, people, mostly, those, believed, to, be, a, threat, to, the, new, ideology, due, to, the, failure, of, the, khmer, rouge, s, agrarian, reform, policies, cambodia, experienced, widespread, famine, as, many, as, one, million, more, died, from, starvation, disease, and, exhaustion, resulting, from, these, policies, in, 1979, vietnam, invaded, cambodia, and, removed, the, khmer, rouge, from, power,

failure, in, 1995, 96, expanding, to, full, fledged, famine, by, 1996, 1999, estimates, based, on, the, north, korean, census, suggest, that, 240, 000, to, 420, 000, people, died, as, a, result, of, the, famine, and, that, there, were, 600, 000, to, 850, 000, unnatural, deaths, in, north, korea, from, 1993, to, 2008, north, korea, has, not, yet, regained, food, self, sufficiency, and, relies, on, external, food, aid, from, china, japan, south, korea, russia, and, the, united, states, while, woo, cumings, have, focused, on, the, fad, side, of, the, famine, moon, argues, that, fad, shifted, the, incentive, structure, of, the, authoritarian, regime, to, react, in, a, way, that, forced, millions, of, disenfranchised, people, to, starve, to, death, according, to, the, un, s, food, and, agriculture, organisation, fao, north, korea, is, facing, a, serious, cereal, shortfall, in, 2017, after, the, country, s, crop, harvest, was, diminished, as, a, result, of, severe, drought, the, fao, estimated, that, early, season, production, fell, by, over, 30, percent, compared, to, agricultural, output, from, the, previous, year, leading, to, the, country, s, worst, famine, since, 2001, japanese, occupation, during, world, war, ii, caused, the, vietnamese, famine, of, 1945, which, caused, around, 700, 000, to, 2, 000, 000, deaths, owing, to, its, almost, entire, dependence, upon, the, monsoon, rains, india, is, vulnerable, to, crop, failures, which, upon, occasion, deepen, into, famine, there, were, 14, famines, in, india, between, the, 11th, and, 17th, centuries, bhatia, 1985, for, example, during, the, 1022, 1033, great, famines, in, india, entire, provinces, were, depopulated, famine, in, deccan, killed, at, least, two, million, people, in, 1702, 1704, b, m, bhatia, believes, that, the, earlier, famines, were, localised, and, it, was, only, after, 1860, during, the, british, rule, that, famine, came, to, signify, general, shortage, of, foodgrains, in, the, country, there, were, approximately, 25, major, famines, spread, through, states, such, as, tamil, nadu, in, the, south, and, bihar, and, bengal, in, the, east, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, romesh, chunder, dutt, argued, as, early, as, 1900, and, present, day, scholars, such, as, amartya, sen, agree, that, some, historic, famines, were, a, product, of, both, uneven, rainfall, and, british, economic, and, administrative, policies, which, since, 1857, had, led, to, the, seizure, and, conversion, of, local, farmland, to, foreign, owned, plantations, restrictions, on, internal, trade, heavy, taxation, of, indian, citizens, to, support, british, expeditions, in, afghanistan, see, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, inflationary, measures, that, increased, the, price, of, food, and, substantial, exports, of, staple, crops, from, india, to, britain, dutt, 1900, and, 1902, srivastava, 1968, sen, 1982, bhatia, 1985, some, british, citizens, such, as, william, digby, agitated, for, policy, reforms, and, famine, relief, but, lord, lytton, the, governing, british, viceroy, in, india, opposed, such, changes, in, the, belief, that, they, would, stimulate, shirking, by, indian, workers, the, first, the, bengal, famine, of, 1770, is, estimated, to, have, taken, around, 10, million, lives, one, third, of, bengal, s, population, at, the, time, other, notable, famines, include, the, great, famine, of, 1876, 1878, in, which, 6, 1, million, to, 10, 3, million, people, died, and, the, indian, famine, of, 1899, 1900, in, which, 1, 25, to, 10, million, people, died, the, famines, were, ended, by, the, 20th, century, with, the, exception, of, the, bengal, famine, of, 1943, killing, an, estimated, 2, 1, million, bengalis, during, world, war, ii, the, observations, of, the, famine, commission, of, 1880, support, the, notion, that, food, distribution, is, more, to, blame, for, famines, than, food, scarcity, they, observed, that, each, province, in, british, india, including, burma, had, a, surplus, of, foodgrains, and, the, annual, surplus, was, 5, 16, million, tons, bhatia, 1970, at, that, time, annual, export, of, rice, and, other, grains, from, india, was, approximately, one, million, tons, population, growth, worsened, the, plight, of, the, peasantry, as, a, result, of, peace, and, improved, sanitation, and, health, the, indian, population, rose, from, perhaps, 100, million, in, 1700, to, 300, million, by, 1920, while, encouraging, agricultural, productivity, the, british, also, provided, economic, incentives, to, have, more, children, to, help, in, the, fields, although, a, similar, population, increase, occurred, in, europe, at, the, same, time, the, growing, numbers, could, be, absorbed, by, industrialization, or, emigration, to, the, americas, and, australia, india, enjoyed, neither, an, industrial, revolution, nor, an, increase, in, food, growing, moreover, indian, landlords, had, a, stake, in, the, cash, crop, system, and, discouraged, innovation, as, a, result, population, numbers, far, outstripped, the, amount, of, available, food, and, land, creating, dire, poverty, and, widespread, hunger, the, maharashtra, drought, saw, zero, deaths, from, starvation, and, is, known, for, the, successful, employment, of, famine, prevention, policies, unlike, during, british, rule, the, persian, famine, of, 1870, 1872, is, believed, to, have, caused, the, death, of, 1, 5, million, persons, 20, 25, of, the, population, in, persia, present, day, iran, in, the, early, 20th, century, an, ottoman, blockade, of, food, being, exported, to, lebanon, caused, a, famine, which, killed, up, to, 450, 000, lebanese, about, one, third, of, the, population, the, famine, killed, more, people, than, the, lebanese, civil, war, the, blockade, was, caused, by, uprisings, in, the, syrian, region, of, the, empire, including, one, which, occurred, in, the, 1860s, which, led, to, the, massacre, of, thousands, of, lebanese, and, syrian, by, ottoman, turks, and, local, druze, the, great, famine, of, 1315, 1317, or, to, 1322, was, the, first, major, food, crisis, to, strike, europe, in, the, 14th, century, millions, in, northern, europe, died, over, an, extended, number, of, years, marking, a, clear, end, to, the, earlier, period, of, growth, and, prosperity, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, an, unusually, cold, and, wet, spring, of, 1315, led, to, widespread, crop, failures, which, lasted, until, at, least, the, summer, of, 1317, some, regions, in, europe, did, not, fully, recover, until, 1322, most, nobles, cities, and, states, were, slow, to, respond, to, the, crisis, and, when, they, realized, its, severity, they, had, little, success, in, securing, food, for, their, people, in, 1315, in, norfolk, england, the, price, of, grain, soared, from, 5, shillings, quarter, to, 20, shillings, quarter, it, was, a, period, marked, by, extreme, levels, of, criminal, activity, disease, and, mass, death, infanticide, and, cannibalism, it, had, consequences, for, church, state, european, society, and, future, calamities, to, follow, in, the, 14th, century, there, were, 95, famines, in, medieval, britain, and, 75, or, more, in, medieval, france, more, than, 10, of, england, s, population, or, at, least, 500, 000, people, may, have, died, during, the, famine, of, 1315, 1316, famine, was, a, very, destabilizing, and, devastating, occurrence, the, prospect, of, starvation, led, people, to, take, desperate, measures, when, scarcity, of, food, became, apparent, to, peasants, they, would, sacrifice, long, term, prosperity, for, short, term, survival, they, would, kill, their, draught, animals, leading, to, lowered, production, in, subsequent, years, they, would, eat, their, seed, corn, sacrificing, next, year, s, crop, in, the, hope, that, more, seed, could, be, found, once, those, means, had, been, exhausted, they, would, take, to, the, road, in, search, of, food, they, migrated, to, the, cities, where, merchants, from, other, areas, would, be, more, likely, to, sell, their, food, as, cities, had, a, stronger, purchasing, power, than, did, rural, areas, cities, also, administered, relief, programs, and, bought, grain, for, their, populations, so, that, they, could, keep, order, with, the, confusion, and, desperation, of, the, migrants, crime, would, often, follow, them, many, peasants, resorted, to, banditry, in, order, to, acquire, enough, to, eat, one, famine, would, often, lead, to, difficulties, in, the, following, years, because, of, lack, of, seed, stock, or, disruption, of, routine, or, perhaps, because, of, less, available, labour, famines, were, often, interpreted, as, signs, of, god, s, displeasure, they, were, seen, as, the, removal, by, god, of, his, gifts, to, the, people, of, the, earth, elaborate, religious, processions, and, rituals, were, made, to, prevent, god, s, wrath, in, the, form, of, famine, during, the, 15th, century, to, the, 18th, century, famines, in, europe, became, more, frequent, due, to, the, little, ice, age, the, colder, climate, resulted, in, harvest, failures, and, shortfalls, that, led, to, a, rise, in, conspiracy, theories, concerning, the, causes, behind, these, famines, such, as, the, pacte, de, famine, in, france, the, 1590s, saw, the, worst, famines, in, centuries, across, all, of, europe, famine, had, been, relatively, rare, during, the, 16th, century, the, economy, and, population, had, grown, steadily, as, subsistence, populations, tend, to, when, there, is, an, extended, period, of, relative, peace, most, of, the, time, although, peasants, in, areas, of, high, population, density, such, as, northern, italy, had, learned, to, increase, the, yields, of, their, lands, through, techniques, such, as, promiscuous, culture, they, were, still, quite, vulnerable, to, famines, forcing, them, to, work, their, land, even, more, intensively, the, great, famine, of, the, 1590s, began, a, period, of, famine, and, decline, in, the, 17th, century, the, price, of, grain, all, over, europe, was, high, as, was, the, population, various, types, of, people, were, vulnerable, to, the, succession, of, bad, harvests, that, occurred, throughout, the, 1590s, in, different, regions, the, increasing, number, of, wage, labourers, in, the, countryside, were, vulnerable, because, they, had, no, food, of, their, own, and, their, meager, living, was, not, enough, to, purchase, the, expensive, grain, of, a, bad, crop, year, town, labourers, were, also, at, risk, because, their, wages, would, be, insufficient, to, cover, the, cost, of, grain, and, to, make, matters, worse, they, often, received, less, money, in, bad, crop, years, since, the, disposable, income, of, the, wealthy, was, spent, on, grain, often, unemployment, would, be, the, result, of, the, increase, in, grain, prices, leading, to, ever, increasing, numbers, of, urban, poor, all, areas, of, europe, were, badly, affected, by, the, famine, in, these, periods, especially, rural, areas, the, netherlands, was, able, to, escape, most, of, the, damaging, effects, of, the, famine, though, the, 1590s, were, still, difficult, years, there, amsterdam, s, grain, trade, with, the, baltic, guaranteed, a, food, supply, the, years, around, 1620, saw, another, period, of, famine, sweep, across, europe, these, famines, were, generally, less, severe, than, the, famines, of, twenty, five, years, earlier, but, they, were, nonetheless, quite, serious, in, many, areas, perhaps, the, worst, famine, since, 1600, the, great, famine, in, finland, in, 1696, killed, one, third, of, the, population, devastating, harvest, failures, afflicted, the, northern, italian, economy, from, 1618, to, 1621, and, it, did, not, recover, fully, for, centuries, there, were, serious, famines, in, the, late, 1640s, and, less, severe, ones, in, the, 1670s, throughout, northern, italy, over, two, million, people, died, in, two, famines, in, france, between, 1693, and, 1710, both, famines, were, made, worse, by, ongoing, wars, as, late, as, the, 1690s, scotland, experienced, famine, which, reduced, the, population, of, parts, of, scotland, by, at, least, 15, the, great, famine, of, 1695, 1697, may, have, killed, a, third, of, the, finnish, population, and, roughly, 10, of, norway, s, population, death, rates, rose, in, scandinavia, between, 1740, and, 1800, as, the, result, of, a, series, of, crop, failures, for, instance, the, finnish, famine, of, 1866, 1868, killed, 15, of, the, population, the, period, of, 1740, 1743, saw, frigid, winters, and, summer, droughts, which, led, to, famine, across, europe, and, a, major, spike, in, mortality, the, winter, 1740, 41, was, unusually, cold, possibly, because, of, volcanic, activity, according, to, scott, and, duncan, 2002, eastern, europe, experienced, more, than, 150, recorded, famines, between, ad, 1500, and, 1700, and, there, were, 100, hunger, years, and, 121, famine, years, in, russia, between, ad, 971, and, 1974, the, great, famine, which, lasted, from, 1770, until, 1771, killed, about, one, tenth, of, czech, lands, population, or, 250, 000, inhabitants, and, radicalised, countrysides, leading, to, peasant, uprisings, there, were, sixteen, good, harvests, and, 111, famine, years, in, northern, italy, from, 1451, to, 1767, according, to, stephen, l, dyson, and, robert, j, rowland, the, jesuits, of, cagliari, recorded, years, during, the, late, 1500s, of, such, hunger, and, so, sterile, that, the, majority, of, the, people, could, sustain, life, only, with, wild, ferns, and, other, weeds, during, the, terrible, famine, of, 1680, some, 80, 000, persons, out, of, a, total, population, of, 250, 000, are, said, to, have, died, and, entire, villages, were, devastated, according, to, bryson, 1974, there, were, thirty, seven, famine, years, in, iceland, between, 1500, and, 1804, in, 1783, the, volcano, laki, in, south, central,

perish, in, the, following, famine, around, ten, thousand, people, died, one, fifth, of, the, population, of, iceland, other, areas, of, europe, have, known, famines, much, more, recently, france, saw, famines, as, recently, as, the, 19th, century, the, great, famine, in, ireland, 1846, 1851, caused, by, the, failure, of, the, potato, crop, over, a, few, years, resulted, in, 1, 000, 000, dead, and, another, 2, 000, 000, refugees, fleeing, to, britain, australia, and, the, united, states, famine, still, occurred, in, eastern, europe, during, the, 20th, century, droughts, and, famines, in, imperial, russia, are, known, to, have, happened, every, 10, to, 13, years, with, average, droughts, happening, every, 5, to, 7, years, russia, experienced, eleven, major, famines, between, 1845, and, 1922, one, of, the, worst, being, the, famine, of, 1891, 1892, the, russian, famine, of, 1921, 22, killed, an, estimated, 5, million, famines, continued, in, the, soviet, era, the, most, notorious, being, the, holodomor, in, various, parts, of, the, country, especially, the, volga, and, the, ukrainian, and, northern, kazakh, ssr, s, during, the, winter, of, 1932, 1933, the, soviet, famine, of, 1932, 1933, is, nowadays, reckoned, to, have, cost, an, estimated, 6, million, lives, the, last, major, famine, in, the, ussr, happened, in, 1947, due, to, the, severe, drought, and, the, mismanagement, of, grain, reserves, by, the, soviet, government, the, hunger, plan, i, e, the, nazi, plan, to, starve, large, sections, of, the, soviet, population, caused, the, deaths, of, many, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, in, 1995, reported, civilian, victims, in, the, ussr, at, german, hands, including, jews, totaled, 13, 7, million, dead, 20, of, the, 68, million, persons, in, the, occupied, ussr, this, included, 4, 1, million, famine, and, disease, deaths, in, occupied, territory, there, were, an, additional, estimated, 3, million, famine, deaths, in, areas, of, the, ussr, not, under, german, occupation, the, 872, days, of, the, siege, of, leningrad, 1941, 1944, caused, unparalleled, famine, in, the, leningrad, region, through, disruption, of, utilities, water, energy, and, food, supplies, this, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, about, one, million, people, famine, also, struck, in, western, europe, during, the, second, world, war, in, the, netherlands, the, hongerwinter, of, 1944, killed, approximately, 30, 000, people, some, other, areas, of, europe, also, experienced, famine, at, the, same, time, the, pre, columbian, americans, often, dealt, with, severe, food, shortages, and, famines, the, persistent, drought, around, 850, ad, coincided, with, the, collapse, of, classic, maya, civilization, and, the, famine, of, one, rabbit, ad, 1454, was, a, major, catastrophe, in, mexico, brazil, s, 1877, 78, grande, seca, great, drought, the, worst, in, brazil, s, history, caused, approximately, half, a, million, deaths, the, one, from, 1915, was, devastating, too, easter, island, was, hit, by, a, great, famine, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, hunger, and, subsequent, cannibalism, was, caused, by, overpopulation, and, depletion, of, natural, resources, as, a, result, of, deforestation, partly, because, work, on, megalithic, monuments, required, a, lot, of, wood, there, are, other, documented, episodes, of, famine, in, various, islands, of, polynesia, such, as, occurred, in, kau, hawaii, in, 1868, according, to, daniel, lord, smail, famine, cannibalism, was, until, recently, a, regular, feature, of, life, in, the, islands, of, the, massim, near, new, guinea, and, of, some, other, societies, of, southeast, asia, and, the, pacific, when, russian, explorer, otto, von, kotzebue, visited, the, marshall, islands, in, micronesia, in, 1817, he, noted, that, marshallese, families, practiced, infanticide, after, the, birth, of, a, third, child, as, a, form, of, population, planning, due, to, frequent, famines, the, guardian, reports, that, as, of, 2007, approximately, 40, of, the, world, s, agricultural, land, is, seriously, degraded, if, current, trends, of, soil, degradation, continue, in, africa, the, continent, might, be, able, to, feed, just, 25, of, its, population, by, 2025, according, to, unu, s, ghana, based, institute, for, natural, resources, in, africa, as, of, late, 2007, increased, farming, for, use, in, biofuels, along, with, world, oil, prices, at, nearly, 100, a, barrel, has, pushed, up, the, price, of, grain, used, to, feed, poultry, and, dairy, cows, and, other, cattle, causing, higher, prices, of, wheat, up, 58, soybean, up, 32, and, maize, up, 11, over, the, year, in, 2007, food, riots, took, place, in, many, countries, across, the, world, an, epidemic, of, stem, rust, which, is, destructive, to, wheat, and, is, caused, by, race, ug99, has, in, 2007, spread, across, africa, and, into, asia, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, nitrogen, fertilizers, new, pesticides, desert, farming, and, other, agricultural, technologies, began, to, be, used, to, increase, food, production, in, part, to, combat, famine, between, 1950, and, 1984, as, the, green, revolution, influenced, agriculture, world, grain, production, increased, by, 250, developed, nations, have, shared, these, technologies, with, developing, nations, with, a, famine, problem, however, as, early, as, 1995, there, were, signs, that, these, new, developments, may, contribute, to, the, decline, of, arable, land, e, g, persistence, of, pesticides, leading, to, soil, contamination, salt, accumulation, due, to, irrigation, erosion, in, 1994, david, pimentel, professor, of, ecology, and, agriculture, at, cornell, university, and, mario, giampietro, senior, researcher, at, the, national, research, institute, on, food, and, nutrition, inran, estimated, the, maximum, u, s, population, for, a, sustainable, economy, at, 200, million, according, to, geologist, dale, allen, pfeiffer, coming, decades, could, see, rising, food, prices, without, relief, and, massive, starvation, on, a, global, level, water, deficits, which, are, already, spurring, heavy, grain, imports, in, numerous, smaller, countries, may, soon, do, the, same, in, larger, countries, such, as, china, or, india, the, water, tables, are, falling, in, many, countries, including, northern, china, the, us, and, india, due, to, widespread, overconsumption, other, countries, affected, include, pakistan, iran, and, mexico, this, will, eventually, lead, to, water, scarcity, and, cutbacks, in, grain, harvest, even, while, overexploiting, its, aquifers, china, has, developed, a, grain, deficit, contributing, to, the, upward, pressure, on, grain, prices, most, of, the, three, billion, people, projected, to, be, added, worldwide, by, mid, century, will, be, born, in, countries, already, experiencing, water, shortages, after, china, and, india, there, is, a, second, tier, of, smaller, countries, with, large, water, deficits, algeria, egypt, iran, mexico, and, pakistan, four, of, these, already, import, a, large, share, of, their, grain, only, pakistan, remains, marginally, self, sufficient, but, with, a, population, expanding, by, 4, million, a, year, it, will, also, soon, turn, to, the, world, market, for, grain, according, to, a, un, climate, report, the, himalayan, glaciers, that, are, the, principal, dry, season, water, sources, of, asia, s, biggest, rivers, ganges, indus, brahmaputra, yangtze, mekong, salween, and, yellow, could, disappear, by, 2350, as, temperatures, rise, and, human, demand, rises, approximately, 2, 4, billion, people, live, in, the, drainage, basin, of, the, himalayan, rivers, india, china, pakistan, afghanistan, bangladesh, nepal, and, myanmar, could, experience, floods, followed, by, severe, droughts, in, coming, decades, in, india, alone, the, ganges, provides, water, for, drinking, and, farming, for, more, than, 500, million, people, evan, fraser, a, geographer, at, the, university, of, guelph, in, ontario, canada, explores, the, ways, in, which, climate, change, may, affect, future, famines, to, do, this, he, draws, on, a, range, of, historic, cases, where, relatively, small, environmental, problems, triggered, famines, as, a, way, of, creating, theoretical, links, between, climate, and, famine, in, the, future, drawing, on, situations, as, diverse, as, the, great, famine, of, ireland, a, series, of, weather, induced, famines, in, asia, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, famines, in, ethiopia, during, the, 1980s, he, concludes, there, are, three, lines, of, defense, that, protect, a, community, s, food, security, from, environmental, change, the, first, line, of, defense, is, the, agro, ecosystem, on, which, food, is, produced, diverse, ecosystems, with, well, managed, soils, high, in, organic, matter, tend, to, be, more, resilient, the, second, line, of, defense, is, the, wealth, and, skills, of, individual, households, if, those, households, affected, by, bad, weather, such, as, drought, have, savings, or, skills, they, may, be, able, to, do, all, right, despite, the, bad, weather, the, final, line, of, defense, is, created, by, the, formal, institutions, present, in, a, society, governments, churches, or, ngos, must, be, willing, and, able, to, mount, effective, relief, efforts, pulling, this, together, evan, fraser, argues, that, if, an, ecosystem, is, resilient, enough, it, may, be, able, to, withstand, weather, related, shocks, but, if, these, shocks, overwhelm, the, ecosystem, s, line, of, defense, it, is, necessary, for, the, household, to, adapt, using, its, skills, and, savings, if, a, problem, is, too, big, for, the, family, or, household, then, people, must, rely, on, the, third, line, of, defense, which, is, whether, or, not, the, formal, institutions, present, in, a, society, are, able, to, provide, help, evan, fraser, concludes, that, in, almost, every, situation, where, an, environmental, problem, triggered, a, famine, you, see, a, failure, in, each, of, these, three, lines, of, defense, hence, understanding, how, climate, change, may, cause, famines, in, the, future, requires, combining, both, an, assessment, of, local, socio, economic, and, environmental, factors, along, with, climate, models, that, predict, where, bad, weather, may, occur, in, the, future, the, covid, 19, pandemic, alongside, lockdowns, and, travel, restrictions, has, prevented, movement, of, aid, and, greatly, impacted, food, production, as, a, result, several, famines, are, forecast, which, the, united, nations, called, a, crisis, of, biblical, proportions, or, hunger, pandemic, this, pandemic, in, conjunction, with, the, 2019, 20, locust, infestations, and, several, ongoing, armed, conflicts, is, predicted, to, form, the, worst, series, of, famines, since, the, great, chinese, famine, affecting, between, 10, and, 20, percent, of, the, global, population, in, some, way, western, nations, suspended, humanitarian, aid, to, afghanistan, following, the, taliban, s, takeover, of, the, country, in, august, 2021, the, united, states, has, frozen, about, 9, billion, in, assets, belonging, to, the, afghan, central, banks, blocking, the, taliban, from, accessing, billions, of, dollars, held, in, u, s, bank, accounts, in, october, 2021, more, than, half, of, afghanistan, s, 39, million, people, faced, an, acute, food, shortage, on, 11, november, 2021, the, human, rights, watch, reported, that, afghanistan, is, facing, widespread, famine, due, to, collapsed, economy, and, broken, banking, system, the, un, world, food, programme, has, also, issued, multiple, warnings, of, worsening, food, insecurity, definitions, of, famines, are, based, on, three, different, categories, these, include, food, supply, based, food, consumption, based, and, mortality, based, definitions, some, definitions, of, famines, are, food, shortages, in, a, population, are, caused, either, by, a, lack, of, food, or, by, difficulties, in, food, distribution, it, may, be, worsened, by, natural, climate, fluctuations, and, by, extreme, political, conditions, related, to, oppressive, government, or, warfare, the, conventional, explanation, until, 1981, for, the, cause, of, famines, was, the, food, availability, decline, fad, hypothesis, the, assumption, was, that, the, central, cause, of, all, famines, was, a, decline, in, food, availability, however, fad, could, not, explain, why, only, a, certain, section, of, the, population, such, as, the, agricultural, laborer, was, affected, by, famines, while, others, were, insulated, from, famines, based, on, the, studies, of, some, recent, famines, the, decisive, role, of, fad, has, been, questioned, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, causal, mechanism, for, precipitating, starvation, includes, many, variables, other, than, just, decline, of, food, availability, according, to, this, view, famines, are, a, result, of, entitlements, the, theory, being, proposed, is, called, the, failure, of, exchange, entitlements, or, fee, a, person, may, own, various, commodities, that, can, be, exchanged, in, a, market, economy, for, the, other, commodities, he, or, she, needs, the, exchange, can, happen, via, trading, or, production, or, through, a, combination, of, the, two, these, entitlements, are, called, trade, based, or, production, based, entitlements, per, this, proposed, view, famines, are, precipitated, due, to, a, breakdown, in, the, ability, of, the, person, to, exchange, his, entitlements, an, example, of, famines, due, to, fee, is, the, inability, of, an, agricultural, laborer, to, exchange, his, primary, entitlement, i, e, labor, for, rice, when, his, employment, became, erratic, or, was, eliminated, according, to, the, physicians, for, social, responsibility, psr, global, climate, change, is, additionally, challenging, the, earth, s, ability, to, produce, food, potentially, leading, to, famine, some, elements, make, a, particular, region, more, vulnerable, to, famine, these, include, poverty, population, growth, an, inappropriate, social, infrastructure, a, suppressive, political, regime, and, a, weak, or, under, prepared, government, according, to, oxfam, international, commenting, on, a, famine, early, warning, systems, network, fews, net, report, famines, are, not, natural, phenomena, they, are, catastrophic, political, failures, thomas, malthus, s, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, has, made, popular, the, theory, of, the, malthusian, catastrophe, that, many, famines, are, caused, by, imbalance, of, food, production, compared, to, the, large, populations, of, countries, whose, population, exceeds, the, regional, carrying, capacity, however, anthropologist, alex, de, waal, executive, director, of, the, world, peace, foundation, refutes, the, malthus, theory, looking, instead, to, political, factors, as, major, causes, of, recent, over, the, last, 150, years, famines, historically, famines, have, occurred, from, agricultural, problems, such, as, drought, crop, failure, or, pestilence, changing, weather, patterns, the, ineffectiveness, of, medieval, governments, in, dealing, with, crises, wars, and, epidemic, diseases, such, as, the, black, death, helped, to, cause, hundreds, of, famines, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, including, 95, in, britain, and, 75, in, france, in, france, the, hundred, years, war, crop, failures, and, epidemics, reduced, the, population, by, two, thirds, economist, amartya, sen, has, also, argued, that, sustained, famines, historically, have, been, caused, by, political, instability, and, repressive, political, regimes, rather, than, overpopulation, the, failure, of, a, harvest, or, change, in, conditions, such, as, drought, can, create, a, situation, whereby, large, numbers, of, people, continue, to, live, where, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, land, has, temporarily, dropped, radically, famine, is, often, associated, with, subsistence, agriculture, the, total, absence, of, agriculture, in, an, economically, strong, area, does, not, cause, famine, arizona, and, other, wealthy, regions, import, the, vast, majority, of, their, food, since, such, regions, produce, sufficient, economic, goods, for, trade, famines, have, also, been, caused, by, volcanism, the, 1815, eruption, of, the, mount, tambora, volcano, in, indonesia, caused, crop, failures, and, famines, worldwide, and, caused, the, worst, famine, of, the, 19th, century, the, current, consensus, of, the, scientific, community, is, that, the, aerosols, and, dust, released, into, the, upper, atmosphere, causes, cooler, temperatures, by, preventing, the, sun, s, energy, from, reaching, the, ground, the, same, mechanism, is, theorized, to, be, caused, by, very, large, meteorite, impacts, to, the, extent, of, causing, mass, extinctions, in, certain, cases, such, as, the, great, leap, forward, in, china, which, produced, the, largest, famine, in, absolute, numbers, north, korea, in, the, mid, 1990s, or, zimbabwe, in, the, early, 2000s, famine, can, occur, because, of, government, policy, according, to, simon, payaslian, a, tentative, scholarly, consensus, classifies, the, soviet, famine, at, least, in, ukraine, where, 2, 5, to, 4, million, perished, as, a, genocide, although, some, scholars, say, that, it, remains, a, significant, issue, in, modern, politics, and, dispute, whether, soviet, policies, would, fall, under, the, legal, definition, of, genocide, several, scholars, have, disputed, that, the, famine, was, a, genocidal, act, by, the, soviet, government, including, j, arch, getty, stephen, g, wheatcroft, r, w, davies, and, mark, tauger, getty, says, that, the, overwhelming, weight, of, opinion, among, scholars, working, in, the, new, archives, is, that, the, terrible, famine, of, the, 1930s, was, the, result, of, stalinist, bungling, and, rigidity, rather, than, some, genocidal, plan, wheatcroft, says, that, the, soviet, government, s, policies, during, the, famine, were, criminal, acts, of, fraud, and, manslaughter, though, not, outright, murder, or, genocide, in, regard, to, the, soviet, state, s, reaction, to, this, crisis, wheatcroft, comments, the, good, harvest, of, 1930, led, to, the, decisions, to, export, substantial, amounts, of, grain, in, 1931, and, 1932, the, soviet, leaders, also, assumed, that, the, wholesale, socialisation, of, livestock, farming, would, lead, to, the, rapid, growth, of, meat, and, dairy, production, these, policies, failed, and, the, soviet, leaders, attributed, the, failure, not, to, their, own, lack, of, realism, but, to, the, machinations, of, enemies, peasant, resistance, was, blamed, on, the, kulaks, and, the, increased, use, of, force, on, a, large, scale, almost, completely, replaced, attempts, at, persuasion, wheatcroft, says, that, soviet, authorities, refused, to, scale, down, grain, procurements, despite, the, low, harvest, and, that, work, has, confirmed, if, confirmation, were, needed, that, the, grain, campaign, in, 1932, 33, was, unprecedentedly, harsh, and, repressive, joseph, stalin, biographer, stephen, kotkin, supports, a, similar, view, stating, that, while, there, is, no, question, of, stalin, s, responsibility, for, the, famine, and, many, deaths, could, have, been, prevented, if, not, for, the, insufficient, and, counterproductive, soviet, measures, there, is, no, evidence, for, stalin, s, intention, to, kill, the, ukrainians, deliberately, while, mark, tauger, considers, the, famine, to, be, the, result, of, natural, factors, stating, that, the, harsh, 1932, 1933, procurements, only, displaced, the, famine, from, urban, areas, but, the, low, harvest, made, a, famine, inevitable, ultimately, concluding, that, it, is, difficult, to, accept, the, famine, as, the, result, of, the, 1932, grain, procurements, and, as, a, conscious, act, of, genocide, he, still, concurs, with, wheatcroft, that, the, regime, was, still, responsible, for, the, deprivation, and, suffering, of, the, soviet, population, in, the, early, 1930s, and, if, anything, these, data, show, that, the, effects, of, were, worse, than, has, been, assumed, in, 1958, in, china, mao, zedong, s, communist, government, launched, the, great, leap, forward, campaign, aimed, at, rapidly, industrializing, the, country, the, government, forcibly, took, control, of, agriculture, barely, enough, grain, was, left, for, the, peasants, and, starvation, occurred, in, many, rural, areas, exportation, of, grain, continued, despite, the, famine, and, the, government, attempted, to, conceal, it, while, the, famine, is, attributed, to, unintended, consequences, it, is, believed, that, the, government, refused, to, acknowledge, the, problem, thereby, further, contributing, to, the, deaths, in, many, instances, peasants, were, persecuted, between, 20, and, 45, million, people, perished, in, this, famine, making, it, one, of, the, deadliest, famines, to, date, historian, and, journalists, such, as, seumas, milne, and, jon, wiener, have, criticized, the, emphasis, on, communism, when, assigning, blame, for, famines, in, a, 2002, article, for, the, guardian, milne, mentions, the, moral, blindness, displayed, towards, the, record, of, colonialism, and, he, writes, if, lenin, and, stalin, are, regarded, as, having, killed, those, who, died, of, hunger, in, the, famines, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, then, churchill, is, certainly, responsible, for, the, 4, million, deaths, in, the, avoidable, bengal, famine, of, 1943, weiner, makes, a, similar, assertion, while, comparing, the, holodomor, and, the, bengal, famine, of, 1943, stating, that, winston, churchill, s, role, in, the, bengal, famine, seems, similar, to, stalin, s, role, in, the, ukrainian, famine, historian, mike, davis, author, of, late, victorian, holocausts, draws, comparisons, between, the, great, chinese, famine, and, the, indian, famines, of, the, late, 19th, century, arguing, that, in, both, instances, the, governments, which, oversaw, the, response, to, the, famines, deliberately, chose, not, to, alleviate, conditions, and, as, such, bear, responsibility, for, the, scale, of, deaths, in, said, famines, according, to, jason, hickel, and, dylan, sullivan, the, number, excess, deaths, during, the, apex, of, british, colonialism, in, india, rise, to, around, 100, million, malawi, ended, its, famine, by, subsidizing, farmers, despite, the, strictures, imposed, by, the, world, bank, during, the, 1973, wollo, famine, in, ethiopia, food, was, shipped, out, of, wollo, to, the, capital, city, of, addis, ababa, where, it, could, command, higher, prices, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, residents, of, the, dictatorships, of, ethiopia, and, sudan, suffered, massive, famines, but, the, democracy, of, botswana, avoided, them, despite, also, suffering, a, severe, drop, in, national, food, production, in, somalia, famine, occurred, because, of, a, failed, state, the, famine, in, yemen, is, a, direct, result, of, the, saudi, arabian, led, intervention, in, yemen, and, the, blockade, imposed, by, saudi, arabia, and, its, allies, including, the, united, states, according, to, the, un, 130, children, under, five, years, of, age, were, dying, from, starvation, and, starvation, related, diseases, every, day, by, the, end, of, 2017, with, 50, 000, dead, for, the, year, as, of, october, 2018, half, the, population, is, at, risk, of, famine, israel, s, blockade, of, gaza, and, the, war, between, israel, and, hamas, led, to, a, famine, in, the, gaza, strip, in, 2024, on, 16, january, 2024, un, experts, accused, israel, of, destroying, gaza, s, food, system, and, using, food, as, a, weapon, against, the, palestinian, people, according, to, amartya, sen, 1999, there, has, never, been, a, famine, in, a, functioning, multiparty, democracy, hasell, and, roser, have, demonstrated, that, while, there, have, been, a, few, minor, exceptions, famines, rarely, occur, in, democratic, systems, but, are, strongly, correlated, with, autocratic, and, colonial, systems, economic, sanctions, are, state, or, un, sanctioned, measures, to, pressure, a, targeted, country, to, submit, to, political, demands, because, such, measures, often, involve, limiting, imports, and, exports, to, crash, or, inflict, pain, on, the, targeted, nation, s, economy, this, can, restrict, the, targeted, nation, s, economic, development, and, make, it, more, difficult, for, their, population, to, access, food, economic, sanctions, have, been, blamed, for, contributing, to, the, north, korean, famine, in, the, 1990s, the, effects, of, sanctions, against, iraq, in, the, 1990s, on, mortality, are, disputed, following, the, taliban, s, takeover, of, afghanistan, in, august, 2021, human, rights, watch, warned, that, afghanistan, was, at, risk, of, famine, and, urged, the, un, world, bank, us, and, other, countries, to, modify, their, sanctions, to, help, prevent, famine, relief, technologies, including, immunization, improved, public, health, infrastructure, general, food, rations, and, supplementary, feeding, for, vulnerable, children, has, provided, temporary, mitigation, to, the, mortality, impact, of, famines, while, leaving, their, economic, consequences, unchanged, and, not, solving, the, underlying, issue, of, too, large, a, regional, population, relative, to, food, production, capability, humanitarian, crises, may, also, arise, from, genocide, campaigns, civil, wars, agro, terrorism, refugee, flows, and, episodes, of, extreme, violence, and, state, collapse, creating, famine, conditions, among, the, affected, populations, despite, repeated, stated, intentions, by, the, world, s, leaders, to, end, hunger, and, famine, famine, remains, a, chronic, threat, in, much, of, africa, eastern, europe, the, southeast, south, asia, and, the, middle, east, in, july, 2005, the, famine, early, warning, systems, network, fews, net, labelled, niger, with, emergency, status, as, well, as, chad, ethiopia, south, sudan, somalia, and, zimbabwe, in, january, 2006, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, warned, that, 11, million, people, in, somalia, kenya, djibouti, and, ethiopia, were, in, danger, of, starvation, due, to, the, combination, of, severe, drought, and, military, conflicts, in, 2006, the, most, serious, humanitarian, crisis, in, africa, was, in, sudan, s, region, darfur, frances, moore, lapp, later, co, founder, of, the, institute, for, food, and, development, policy, food, first, argued, in, diet, for, a, small, planet, 1971, that, vegetarian, diets, can, provide, food, for, larger, populations, with, the, same, resources, compared, to, omnivorous, diets, noting, that, modern, famines, are, sometimes, aggravated, by, misguided, economic, policies, political, design, to, impoverish, or, marginalize, certain, populations, or, acts, of, war, political, economists, have, investigated, the, political, conditions, under, which, famine, is, prevented, economist, amartya, sen, states, that, the, liberal, institutions, that, exist, in, india, including, competitive, elections, and, a, free, press, have, played, a, major, role, in, preventing, famine, in, that, country, since, independence, alex, de, waal, has, developed, this, theory, to, focus, on, the, political, contract, between, rulers, and, people, that, ensures, famine, prevention, noting, the, rarity, of, such, political, contracts, in, africa, and, the, danger, that, international, relief, agencies, will, undermine, such, contracts, through, removing, the, locus, of, accountability, for, famines, from, national, governments, the, demographic, impacts, of, famine, are, sharp, mortality, is, concentrated, among, children, and, the, elderly, a, consistent, demographic, fact, is, that, in, all, recorded, famines, male, mortality, exceeds, female, even, in, those, populations, such, as, northern, india, and, pakistan, where, there, is, a, male, longevity, advantage, during, normal, times, reasons, for, this, may, include, greater, female, resilience, under, the, pressure, of, malnutrition, and, possibly, female, s, naturally, higher, percentage, of, body, fat, famine, is, also, accompanied, by, lower, fertility, famines, therefore, leave, the, reproductive, core, of, a, population, adult, women, lesser, affected, compared, to, other, population, categories, and, post, famine, periods, are, often, characterized, a, rebound, with, increased, births, even, though, the, theories, of, thomas, malthus, would, predict, that, famines, reduce, the, size, of, the, population, commensurate, with, available, food, resources, in, fact, even, the, most, severe, famines, have, rarely, dented, population, growth, for, more, than, a, few, years, the, mortality, in, china, in, 1958, 61, bengal, in, 1943, and, ethiopia, in, 1983, 85, was, all, made, up, by, a, growing, population, over, just, a, few, years, of, greater, long, term, demographic, impact, is, emigration, ireland, was, chiefly, depopulated, after, the, 1840s, famines, by, waves, of, emigration, globally, the, amount, of, food, produced, per, person, has, kept, rising, despite, a, growing, world, population, a, local, crop, failure, does, not, cause, a, famine, unless, there, is, also, a, lack, of, money, to, buy, food, from, elsewhere, a, war, or, political, oppression, can, also, disrupt, distribution, of, otherwise, adequate, global, supplies, long, term, measures, to, improve, food, security, include, investment, in, modern, agriculture, techniques, such, as, fertilizers, and, irrigation, but, can, also, include, strategic, national, food, storage, world, bank, strictures, restrict, government, subsidies, for, farmers, and, increasing, use, of, fertilizers, is, opposed, by, some, environmental, groups, because, of, its, unintended, consequences, adverse, effects, on, water, supplies, and, habitat, the, effort, to, bring, modern, agricultural, techniques, found, in, the, western, world, such, as, nitrogen, fertilizers, and, pesticides, to, the, indian, sub, continent, called, the, green, revolution, resulted, in, decreases, in, malnutrition, similar, to, those, seen, earlier, in, western, nations, this, was, possible, because, of, existing, infrastructure, and, institutions, that, are, in, short, supply, in, africa, such, as, a, system, of, roads, or, public, seed, companies, that, made, seeds, available, supporting, farmers, in, areas, of, food, insecurity, through, such, measures, as, free, or, subsidized, fertilizers, and, seeds, increases, food, harvest, and, reduces, food, prices, the, energy, for, the, green, revolution, was, provided, by, fossil, fuels, in, the, form, of, fertilizers, natural, gas, pesticides, oil, and, hydrocarbon, fueled, irrigation, the, development, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, has, significantly, supported, global, population, growth, it, has, been, estimated, that, almost, half, the, people, on, the, earth, are, currently, fed, as, a, result, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, use, the, world, bank, and, some, rich, nations, press, nations, that, depend, on, them, for, aid, to, cut, back, or, eliminate, subsidized, agricultural, inputs, such, as, fertilizer, in, the, name, of, privatization, even, as, the, united, states, and, europe, extensively, subsidized, their, own, farmers, there, is, a, growing, realization, among, aid, groups, that, giving, cash, or, cash, vouchers, instead, of, food, is, a, cheaper, faster, and, more, efficient, way, to, deliver, help, to, the, hungry, particularly, in, areas, where, food, is, available, but, unaffordable, the, united, nations, world, food, programme, the, biggest, non, governmental, distributor, of, food, announced, that, it, will, begin, distributing, cash, and, vouchers, instead, of, food, in, some, areas, which, josette, sheeran, wfp, s, former, executive, director, described, as, a, revolution, in, food, aid, the, aid, agency, concern, worldwide, is, piloting, a, method, through, a, mobile, phone, operator, safaricom, which, runs, a, money, transfer, program, that, allows, cash, to, be, sent, from, one, part, of, the, country, to, another, however, for, people, in, a, drought, living, a, long, way, from, and, with, limited, access, to, markets, delivering, food, may, be, the, most, appropriate, way, to, help, fred, cuny, stated, that, the, chances, of, saving, lives, at, the, outset, of, a, relief, operation, are, greatly, reduced, when, food, is, imported, by, the, time, it, arrives, in, the, country, and, gets, to, people, many, will, have, died, us, law, which, requires, buying, food, at, home, rather, than, where, the, hungry, live, is, inefficient, because, approximately, half, of, what, is, spent, goes, for, transport, fred, cuny, further, pointed, out, studies, of, every, recent, famine, have, shown, that, food, was, available, in, country, though, not, always, in, the, immediate, food, deficit, area, and, even, though, by, local, standards, the, prices, are, too, high, for, the, poor, to, purchase, it, it, would, usually, be, cheaper, for, a, donor, to, buy, the, hoarded, food, at, the, inflated, price, than, to, import, it, from, abroad, deficient, micronutrients, can, be, provided, through, fortifying, foods, fortifying, foods, such, as, peanut, butter, sachets, see, plumpy, nut, have, revolutionized, emergency, feeding, in, humanitarian, emergencies, because, they, can, be, eaten, directly, from, the, packet, do, not, require, refrigeration, or, mixing, with, scarce, clean, water, can, be, stored, for, years, and, vitally, can, be, absorbed, by, extremely, ill, children, who, and, other, sources, recommend, that, malnourished, children, and, adults, who, also, have, diarrhea, drink, rehydration, solution, and, continue, to, eat, in, addition, to, antibiotics, and, zinc, supplements, there, is, a, special, oral, rehydration, solution, called, resomal, which, has, less, sodium, and, more, potassium, than, standard, solution, however, if, the, diarrhea, is, severe, the, standard, solution, is, preferable, as, the, person, needs, the, extra, sodium, obviously, this, is, a, judgment, call, best, made, by, a, physician, and, using, either, solution, is, better, than, doing, nothing, zinc, supplements, often, can, help, reduce, the, duration, and, severity, of, diarrhea, and, vitamin, a, can, also, be, helpful, the, world, health, organization, underlines, the, importance, of, a, person, with, diarrhea, continuing, to, eat, with, a, 2005, publication, for, physicians, stating, food, should, never, be, withheld, and, the, child, s, usual, foods, should, not, be, diluted, breastfeeding, should, always, be, continued, ethiopia, has, been, pioneering, a, program, that, has, now, become, part, of, the, world, bank, s, prescribed, recipe, for, coping, with, a, food, crisis, and, had, been, seen, by, aid, organizations, as, a, model, of, how, to, best, help, hungry, nations, through, the, country, s, main, food, assistance, program, the, productive, safety, net, program, ethiopia, has, been, giving, rural, residents, who, are, chronically, short, of, food, a, chance, to, work, for, food, or, cash, foreign, aid, organizations, like, the, world, food, program, were, then, able, to, buy, food, locally, from, surplus, areas, to, distribute, in, areas, with, a, shortage, of, food, the, green, revolution, was, widely, viewed, as, an, answer, to, famine, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, between, 1950, and, 1984, hybrid, strains, of, high, yielding, crops, transformed, agriculture, around, the, globe, and, world, grain, production, increased, by, 250, some, criticize, the, process, stating, that, these, new, high, yielding, crops, require, more, chemical, fertilizers, and, pesticides, which, can, harm, the, environment, although, these, high, yielding, crops, make, it, technically, possible, to, feed, more, people, there, are, indications, that, regional, food, production, has, peaked, in, many, world, sectors, due, to, certain, strategies, associated, with, intensive, agriculture, such, as, groundwater, overdrafting, and, overuse, of, pesticides, and, other, agricultural, chemicals, in, modern, times, local, and, political, governments, and, non, governmental, organizations, that, deliver, famine, relief, have, limited, resources, with, which, to, address, the, multiple, situations, of, food, insecurity, that, are, occurring, simultaneously, various, methods, of, categorizing, the, gradations, of, food, security, have, thus, been, used, in, order, to, most, efficiently, allocate, food, relief, one, of, the, earliest, were, the, indian, famine, codes, devised, by, the, british, in, the, 1880s, the, codes, listed, three, stages, of, food, insecurity, near, scarcity, scarcity, and, famine, and, were, highly, influential, in, the, creation, of, subsequent, famine, warning, or, measurement, systems, the, early, warning, system, developed, to, monitor, the, region, inhabited, by, the, turkana, people, in, northern, kenya, also, has, three, levels, but, links, each, stage, to, a, pre, planned, response, to, mitigate, the, crisis, and, prevent, its, deterioration, the, experiences, of, famine, relief, organizations, throughout, the, world, over, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, resulted, in, at, least, two, major, developments, the, livelihoods, approach, and, the, increased, use, of, nutrition, indicators, to, determine, the, severity, of, a, crisis, individuals, and, groups, in, food, stressful, situations, will, attempt, to, cope, by, rationing, consumption, finding, alternative, means, to, supplement, income, etc, before, taking, desperate, measures, such, as, selling, off, plots, of, agricultural, land, when, all, means, of, self, support, are, exhausted, the, affected, population, begins, to, migrate, in, search, of, food, or, fall, victim, to, outright, mass, starvation, famine, may, thus, be, viewed, partially, as, a, social, phenomenon, involving, markets, the, price, of, food, and, social, support, structures, a, second, lesson, drawn, was, the, increased, use, of, rapid, nutrition, assessments, in, particular, of, children, to, give, a, quantitative, measure, of, the, famine, s, severity, since, 2003, many, of, the, most, important, organizations, in, famine, relief, such, as, the, world, food, programme, and, the, u, s, agency, for, international, development, have, adopted, a, five, level, scale, measuring, intensity, and, magnitude, the, intensity, scale, uses, both, livelihoods, measures, and, measurements, of, mortality, and, child, malnutrition, to, categorize, a, situation, as, food, secure, food, insecure, food, crisis, famine, severe, famine, and, extreme, famine, the, number, of, deaths, determines, the, magnitude, designation, with, under, 1000, fatalities, defining, a, minor, famine, and, a, catastrophic, famine, resulting, in, over, 1, 000, 000, deaths, famine, personified, as, an, allegory, is, found, in, some, cultures, famine, is, one, of, the, four, horsemen, of, the, apocalypse, in, christian, tradition, a, man, riding, a, black, horse, holding, a, balance, scale, the, fear, gorta, of, irish, folklore, or, the, wendigo, of, algonquian, tradition, a, 2023, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, has, shown, that, prenatal, famine, exposure, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, mental, disorders, such, as, depression, and, schizophrenia, and, changes, in, dna, methylation, that, is, further, exacerbating, the, impact, of, famine, on, human, health, and, nutrition
