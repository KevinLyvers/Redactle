min, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, m, ny, pe, h, e, j, b, n, g, b, n, g, r, b, n, g, m, n, buc, m, ng, ng, is, a, broad, group, of, sinitic, languages, with, about, 70, million, native, speakers, these, languages, are, spoken, in, fujian, province, as, well, as, by, the, descendants, of, min, speaking, colonists, on, the, leizhou, peninsula, and, hainan, and, by, the, assimilated, natives, of, chaoshan, parts, of, zhongshan, three, counties, in, southern, wenzhou, the, zhoushan, archipelago, taiwan, and, scattered, in, pockets, or, sporadically, across, hong, kong, macau, and, several, countries, in, southeast, asia, particularly, singapore, malaysia, the, philippines, indonesia, thailand, myanmar, cambodia, vietnam, brunei, the, name, is, derived, from, the, min, river, in, fujian, which, is, also, the, abbreviated, name, of, fujian, province, min, varieties, are, not, mutually, intelligible, with, one, another, nor, with, any, other, variety, of, chinese, such, as, mandarin, cantonese, wu, gan, xiang, or, hakka, there, are, many, min, speakers, among, overseas, chinese, in, southeast, asia, the, most, widely, spoken, variety, of, min, outside, of, mainland, china, is, hokkien, a, variety, of, southern, min, which, has, its, origin, in, southern, fujian, amoy, hokkien, is, the, prestige, dialect, of, hokkien, in, fujian, while, a, majority, of, taiwanese, speak, a, dialect, called, taiwanese, hokkien, or, simply, taiwanese, the, majority, of, chinese, singaporeans, chinese, malaysians, chinese, filipinos, chinese, indonesians, chinese, thais, chinese, cambodians, are, of, southern, min, speaking, background, particularly, hokkien, and, or, teochew, although, the, rise, of, mandarin, has, led, to, a, decline, in, the, use, of, min, chinese, communities, speaking, eastern, min, pu, xian, min, haklau, min, leizhou, min, and, hainanese, can, also, be, found, in, parts, of, the, chinese, diaspora, such, as, in, malaysia, singapore, and, indonesia, many, min, languages, have, retained, notable, features, of, the, old, chinese, language, and, there, is, linguistic, evidence, that, not, all, min, varieties, are, directly, descended, from, middle, chinese, of, the, sui, tang, dynasties, min, languages, are, believed, to, have, a, significant, linguistic, substrate, from, the, languages, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, region, before, its, sinicization, the, min, homeland, of, fujian, was, opened, to, han, chinese, settlement, by, the, defeat, of, the, minyue, state, by, the, armies, of, emperor, wu, of, han, in, 110, bc, the, area, features, rugged, mountainous, terrain, with, short, rivers, that, flow, into, the, south, china, sea, most, subsequent, migration, from, north, to, south, china, passed, through, the, valleys, of, the, xiang, and, gan, rivers, to, the, west, so, that, min, varieties, have, experienced, less, northern, influence, than, other, southern, groups, as, a, result, whereas, most, varieties, of, chinese, can, be, treated, as, derived, from, middle, chinese, the, language, described, by, rhyme, dictionaries, such, as, the, qieyun, 601, ad, min, varieties, contain, traces, of, older, distinctions, linguists, estimate, that, the, oldest, layers, of, min, dialects, diverged, from, the, rest, of, chinese, around, the, time, of, the, han, dynasty, however, significant, waves, of, migration, from, the, north, china, plain, occurred, jerry, norman, identifies, four, main, layers, in, the, vocabulary, of, modern, min, varieties, laurent, sagart, 2008, disagrees, with, norman, and, mei, tsu, lin, s, analysis, of, an, austroasiatic, substratum, in, min, the, hypothesis, proposed, by, jerry, norman, and, mei, tsu, lin, arguing, for, an, austroasiatic, homeland, along, the, middle, yangtze, has, been, largely, abandoned, in, most, circles, and, left, unsupported, by, the, majority, of, austroasiatic, specialists, rather, recent, movements, of, analyzing, archeological, evidence, posit, an, austronesian, layer, rather, than, an, austroasiatic, one, min, languages, by, number, of, native, speakers, as, of, 2004, min, is, usually, described, as, one, of, seven, or, ten, groups, of, varieties, of, chinese, but, has, greater, dialectal, diversity, than, any, of, the, other, groups, the, varieties, used, in, neighbouring, counties, and, in, the, mountains, of, western, fujian, even, in, adjacent, villages, are, often, mutually, unintelligible, early, classifications, such, as, those, of, li, fang, kuei, in, 1937, and, yuan, jiahua, in, 1960, divided, min, into, northern, and, southern, subgroups, however, in, a, 1963, report, on, a, survey, of, fujian, pan, maoding, and, colleagues, argued, that, the, primary, split, was, between, inland, and, coastal, groups, a, key, discriminator, between, the, two, groups, is, a, group, of, words, that, have, a, lateral, initial, l, in, coastal, varieties, and, a, voiceless, fricative, s, or, in, inland, varieties, contrasting, with, another, group, having, l, in, both, areas, norman, reconstructs, these, initials, in, proto, min, as, voiceless, and, voiced, laterals, that, merged, in, coastal, varieties, the, coastal, varieties, have, the, vast, majority, of, speakers, and, have, spread, from, their, homeland, in, fujian, and, eastern, guangdong, to, the, islands, of, taiwan, and, hainan, to, other, coastal, areas, of, southern, china, and, to, southeast, asia, pan, and, colleagues, divided, them, into, three, groups, the, language, atlas, of, china, 1987, distinguished, two, further, groups, which, had, previously, been, included, in, southern, min, coastal, varieties, feature, some, uniquely, min, vocabulary, including, pronouns, and, negatives, all, but, the, hainan, dialects, have, complex, tone, sandhi, systems, although, they, have, far, fewer, speakers, the, inland, varieties, show, much, greater, variation, than, the, coastal, ones, pan, and, colleagues, divided, the, inland, varieties, into, two, groups, the, language, atlas, of, china, 1987, included, a, further, group, although, coastal, varieties, can, be, derived, from, a, proto, language, with, four, series, of, stops, or, affricates, at, each, point, of, articulation, e, g, t, t, d, and, d, inland, varieties, contain, traces, of, two, further, series, which, norman, termed, softened, stops, due, to, their, reflexes, in, some, varieties, inland, varieties, use, pronouns, and, negatives, cognate, with, those, in, hakka, and, yue, inland, varieties, have, little, or, no, tone, sandhi, most, min, vocabulary, corresponds, directly, to, cognates, in, other, chinese, varieties, but, there, are, also, a, significant, number, of, distinctively, min, words, that, may, be, traced, back, to, proto, min, in, some, cases, a, semantic, shift, has, occurred, in, min, or, the, rest, of, chinese, norman, and, mei, tsu, lin, have, suggested, an, austroasiatic, origin, for, some, min, words, however, norman, and, mei, tsu, lin, s, suggestion, is, rejected, by, laurent, sagart, 2008, with, some, linguists, arguing, that, the, austroasiatic, predecessor, of, the, modern, vietnamese, language, originated, in, the, mountainous, region, in, central, laos, and, vietnam, rather, than, in, the, region, north, of, the, red, river, delta, in, other, cases, the, origin, of, the, min, word, is, obscure, such, words, include, when, using, chinese, characters, to, write, a, non, mandarin, form, a, common, practice, is, to, use, characters, that, correspond, etymologically, to, the, words, being, represented, and, for, words, with, no, evident, etymology, to, either, invent, new, characters, or, borrow, characters, for, their, sound, or, meaning, written, cantonese, has, carried, this, process, out, to, the, farthest, extent, of, any, non, mandarin, variety, to, the, extent, that, pure, cantonese, vernacular, can, be, unambiguously, written, using, chinese, characters, contrary, to, popular, belief, a, vernacular, written, in, this, fashion, is, not, in, general, comprehensible, to, a, mandarin, speaker, due, to, significant, changes, in, grammar, and, vocabulary, and, the, necessary, use, of, a, large, number, of, non, mandarin, characters, for, most, min, varieties, a, similar, process, has, not, taken, place, for, hokkien, competing, systems, exist, given, that, min, combines, the, chinese, of, several, different, periods, and, contains, some, non, chinese, substrate, vocabulary, an, author, literate, in, mandarin, or, even, classical, chinese, may, have, trouble, finding, the, appropriate, chinese, characters, for, some, min, vocabulary, in, the, case, of, taiwanese, there, are, also, indigenous, words, borrowed, from, formosan, languages, particularly, for, place, names, as, well, as, a, substantial, number, of, loan, words, from, japanese, the, min, hokkien, teochew, hainanese, luichow, hinghwa, hokchew, hokchia, haklau, hai, lok, hong, spoken, in, singapore, malaysia, and, indonesia, has, borrowed, heavily, from, malay, or, indonesian, for, indonesia, and, to, a, lesser, extent, from, singaporean, or, malaysian, english, and, other, languages, meanwhile, the, hokkien, spoken, in, the, philippines, has, also, borrowed, a, few, terms, from, spanish, tagalog, filipino, and, english, over, the, recent, centuries, in, hokkien, kelantan, spoken, in, kelantan, state, of, malaysia, to, pattani, province, of, thailand, a, mix, of, southern, thai, and, kelantan, malay, is, also, used, with, the, local, kelantan, hokkien, of, peranakans, and, chinese, malaysians, in, northern, malaya, the, result, is, that, adapting, chinese, characters, to, write, min, requires, a, substantial, effort, to, choose, characters, for, a, significant, portion, of, the, vocabulary, other, approaches, to, writing, min, rely, on, romanization, or, phonetic, systems, such, as, taiwanese, phonetic, symbols, or, historically, during, japanese, rule, over, taiwan, taiwanese, kana, was, also, used, for, taiwanese, hokkien, in, some, taiwanese, japanese, dictionaries, made, during, that, time, since, 1987, taiwanese, hangul, also, exists, for, taiwanese, hokkien, some, min, speakers, use, the, church, romanization, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, ji, ohu, lu, m, z, pe, h, e, j, k, u, ho, l, m, j, for, hokkien, the, romanization, is, called, pe, h, e, j, poj, for, fuzhounese, it, is, called, foochow, romanized, b, ng, u, c, buc, for, putian, dialect, it, is, called, hinghwa, romanized, hing, hua, b, u, ci, for, jian, ou, dialect, it, is, called, kienning, colloquial, romanized, g, ing, n, ing, l, m, c, for, hainanese, it, is, called, b, h, oe, tu, bot, these, systems, were, developed, by, british, irish, danish, and, american, protestant, christian, missionaries, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, in, 2006, t, i, l, t, i, u, n, l, m, j, phing, im, hong, n, which, was, derived, from, pe, h, e, j, poj, was, officially, promoted, by, taiwan, s, ministry, of, education, moe, some, publications, use, mixed, writing, with, mostly, chinese, characters, but, using, the, latin, alphabet, to, represent, words, that, cannot, easily, be, represented, by, chinese, characters, in, taiwan, a, mix, of, chinese, characters, and, latin, letters, written, in, pe, h, e, j, poj, or, t, i, l, has, recently, been, practised, in, singapore, malaysia, the, philippines, and, indonesia, some, also, occasionally, write, hokkien, and, or, teochew, using, latin, letters, via, ad, hoc, means, using, the, writer, s, knowledge, of, the, local, mainstream, orthography, they, grew, up, being, literate, in, such, as, singaporean, or, malaysian, english, orthography, descended, from, british, english, malay,
