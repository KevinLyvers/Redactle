and, management, the, term, charismatic, describes, a, type, of, leadership, in, christian, theology, the, term, charisma, appears, as, the, spiritual, gift, charism, which, is, an, endowment, with, an, extraordinary, power, given, by, the, holy, spirit, the, english, word, charisma, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, word, ch, risma, which, denotes, a, favor, freely, given, and, the, gift, of, grace, the, singular, term, and, the, plural, term, charismata, both, derive, from, the, word, charis, meaning, grace, and, charm, in, religious, praxis, the, ancient, greeks, ascribed, personality, charisma, to, their, pantheon, of, gods, and, goddesses, e, g, attributing, charm, beauty, nature, creativity, and, fertility, to, the, individual, charites, in, theology, and, sociology, the, denotations, of, the, word, charisma, expanded, from, the, ancient, greek, definition, into, the, connotations, of, divinely, conferred, charisma, and, of, personality, charisma, thus, in, a, history, of, charisma, 2010, john, potts, said, that, contemporary, charisma, maintains, however, the, irreducible, character, ascribed, to, it, by, weber, it, retains, a, mysterious, elusive, quality, media, commentators, regularly, describe, charisma, as, the, x, factor, the, enigmatic, character, of, charisma, also, suggests, a, connection, at, least, to, some, degree, to, the, earliest, manifestations, of, charisma, as, a, spiritual, gift, 3, moreover, the, koine, greek, dialect, spoken, in, ancient, rome, employed, the, terms, charisma, and, charismata, without, the, religious, connotations, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, christian, bible, record, the, development, of, divinely, conferred, charisma, in, the, hebrew, text, the, idea, of, charismatic, leadership, is, generally, signaled, by, the, use, of, the, noun, hen, favor, or, the, verb, hanan, to, show, favor, the, greek, term, for, charisma, grace, or, favor, and, its, root, charis, grace, replaced, the, hebrew, terms, in, the, greek, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, 3rd, century, bce, septuagint, throughout, the, paradigmatic, image, of, the, charismatic, hero, is, the, figure, who, has, received, god, s, favor, 1545, in, other, words, divinely, conferred, charisma, applied, to, highly, revered, figures, thus, eastern, mediterranean, jews, in, the, 1st, century, ce, had, notions, of, charis, and, charisma, that, embraced, the, range, of, meanings, found, in, greek, culture, and, the, spiritual, meanings, from, the, hebrew, bible, 15, from, this, linguistic, legacy, of, fused, cultures, in, 1, corinthians, paul, the, apostle, introduced, the, meaning, that, the, holy, spirit, bestowed, charism, and, charismata, the, gift, of, god, s, grace, upon, individuals, or, groups, for, paul, here, is, a, clear, distinction, between, charisma, and, charis, charisma, is, the, direct, result, of, divine, charis, or, grace, 36, 37, 1549, in, the, new, testament, epistles, paul, refers, to, charisma, or, its, plural, charismata, seven, times, in, 1, corinthians, written, in, koine, or, common, greek, around, 54, ce, he, elaborates, on, his, concepts, with, six, references, in, romans, c, 56, he, makes, three, individual, references, in, 2, corinthians, 56, 1, timothy, and, 2, timothy, 62, 67, the, seventeenth, and, only, other, mention, of, charisma, is, in, 1, peter, 23, 37, 43, 45, the, gospels, written, in, the, late, first, century, apply, divinely, conferred, charisma, to, revered, figures, examples, are, accounts, of, jesus, baptism, and, of, his, transfiguration, in, which, disciples, see, him, as, radiant, with, light, appearing, together, with, moses, and, elijah, another, example, is, gabriel, s, greeting, to, mary, as, full, of, grace, in, these, and, other, instances, early, christians, designated, certain, individuals, as, possessing, spiritual, gifts, and, these, gifts, included, the, ability, to, penetrate, the, neighbour, to, the, bottom, of, his, heart, and, spirit, and, to, recognize, whether, he, is, dominated, by, a, good, or, by, an, evil, spirit, and, the, gift, to, help, him, to, freedom, from, his, demon, believers, characterized, their, revered, religious, figures, as, having, a, higher, perfection, a, special, charisma, then, with, the, establishment, of, the, christian, church, the, old, charismatic, gifts, and, free, offerings, were, transformed, into, a, hierarchical, sacerdotal, system, the, focus, on, the, institution, rather, than, divinely, inspired, individuals, increasingly, dominated, religious, thought, and, life, and, that, focus, went, unchanged, for, centuries, in, the, 17th, century, church, leaders, notably, in, the, latin, tradition, accented, individual, gifts, particular, talents, imparted, by, god, or, the, holy, spirit, the, 19th, century, brought, a, shift, in, emphasis, toward, individual, and, spiritual, aspects, of, charisma, protestant, and, some, catholic, theologians, narrowed, the, concept, to, superlative, out, of, the, ordinary, and, virtuoso, gifts, simultaneously, the, term, became, alienated, from, the, much, wider, meaning, that, early, christians, had, attached, to, it, still, the, narrowed, term, projected, back, to, the, earlier, period, a, systematically, reflected, and, highly, differentiated, understanding, of, charisma, was, often, unconsciously, infused, into, the, scriptures, and, writings, of, the, church, fathers, so, that, these, texts, were, no, longer, read, through, the, eyes, of, the, authors, these, dialectic, meanings, influenced, changes, in, pentecostalism, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, charismatic, movements, in, some, mainline, churches, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, discussion, in, the, 21st, century, religion, section, explores, what, charisma, means, in, these, and, other, religious, groups, the, basis, for, modern, secular, usage, comes, from, german, sociologist, max, weber, he, discovered, the, term, in, the, work, of, rudolph, sohm, a, german, church, historian, whose, 1892, kirchenrecht, was, immediately, recognized, in, germany, as, an, epoch, making, work, it, also, stimulated, a, debate, between, sohm, and, leading, theologians, and, religion, scholars, which, lasted, more, than, twenty, years, and, stimulated, a, rich, polemical, literature, that, debate, and, literature, had, made, charisma, a, popular, term, when, weber, used, it, in, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, and, in, his, sociology, of, religion, perhaps, because, he, assumed, that, readers, already, understood, the, idea, weber, s, early, writings, lacked, definition, or, explanation, of, the, concept, in, the, collection, of, his, works, economy, and, society, he, identified, the, term, as, a, prime, example, of, action, he, labeled, value, rational, in, distinction, from, and, opposition, to, action, he, labeled, instrumentally, rational, because, he, applied, meanings, for, charisma, similar, to, sohm, who, had, affirmed, the, purely, charismatic, nature, of, early, christianity, 1544, weber, s, charisma, would, have, coincided, with, the, divinely, conferred, charisma, sense, defined, above, in, sohm, s, work, weber, introduced, the, personality, charisma, sense, when, he, applied, charisma, to, designate, a, form, of, authority, to, explain, charismatic, authority, he, developed, his, classic, definition, charisma, is, a, certain, quality, of, an, individual, personality, by, virtue, of, which, he, is, set, apart, from, ordinary, men, and, treated, as, endowed, with, supernatural, superhuman, or, at, least, specifically, exceptional, powers, or, qualities, these, as, such, are, not, accessible, to, the, ordinary, person, but, are, regarded, as, of, divine, origin, or, as, exemplary, and, on, the, basis, of, them, the, individual, concerned, is, treated, as, a, leader, 328, 358ff, here, weber, extends, the, concept, of, charisma, beyond, supernatural, to, superhuman, and, even, to, exceptional, powers, and, qualities, sociologist, paul, joosse, examined, weber, s, famous, definition, and, found, that, through, simple, yet, profoundly, consequential, phrases, such, as, are, considered, and, is, treated, charisma, becomes, a, relational, attributable, and, at, last, a, properly, sociological, concept, for, weber, the, locus, of, power, is, in, the, led, who, actively, if, perhaps, unconsciously, invest, their, leaders, with, social, authority, in, other, words, weber, indicates, that, it, is, followers, who, attribute, powers, to, the, individual, emphasizing, that, the, recognition, on, the, part, of, those, subject, to, authority, is, decisive, for, the, validity, of, charisma, 359, weber, died, in, 1920, leaving, disordered, fragmentary, manuscripts, without, even, the, guidance, of, a, plan, or, table, of, the, proposed, contents, one, unfinished, manuscript, contained, his, above, quoted, definition, of, charisma, it, took, over, a, quarter, century, for, his, work, to, be, translated, into, english, with, regard, to, charisma, weber, s, formulations, are, generally, regarded, as, having, revived, the, concept, from, its, deep, theological, obscurity, however, even, with, the, admirable, translations, and, prefaces, of, his, entire, works, many, scholars, have, found, weber, s, formulations, ambiguous, for, the, past, half, century, they, have, debated, the, meaning, of, many, weberian, concepts, including, the, meaning, of, charisma, the, role, of, followers, and, the, degree, of, a, supernatural, component
