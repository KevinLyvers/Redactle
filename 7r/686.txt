libertarianism, from, french, libertaire, itself, from, the, latin, libertas, lit, freedom, is, a, political, philosophy, that, places, a, strong, emphasis, on, the, value, of, liberty, libertarians, advocate, for, the, expansion, of, individual, autonomy, and, political, freedom, emphasizing, the, principles, of, equality, before, the, law, and, the, protection, of, civil, rights, including, the, rights, to, freedom, of, association, freedom, of, speech, freedom, of, thought, and, freedom, of, choice, libertarians, often, oppose, authority, state, power, warfare, militarism, and, nationalism, but, some, libertarians, diverge, on, the, scope, of, their, opposition, to, existing, economic, and, political, systems, various, schools, of, libertarian, thought, offer, a, range, of, views, regarding, the, legitimate, functions, of, state, and, private, power, different, categorizations, have, been, used, to, distinguish, various, forms, of, libertarianism, scholars, have, identified, distinct, libertarian, perspectives, on, the, nature, of, property, and, capital, typically, delineating, them, along, left, right, or, socialist, capitalist, axes, the, various, schools, of, libertarian, thought, have, also, been, shaped, by, liberal, ideas, in, the, mid, 19th, century, libertarianism, originated, as, a, form, of, left, wing, politics, such, as, anti, authoritarian, and, anti, state, socialists, like, anarchists, especially, social, anarchists, but, more, generally, libertarian, communists, marxists, and, libertarian, socialists, these, libertarians, sought, to, abolish, capitalism, and, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, or, else, to, restrict, their, purview, or, effects, to, usufruct, property, norms, in, favor, of, common, or, cooperative, ownership, and, management, viewing, private, property, in, the, means, of, production, as, a, barrier, to, freedom, and, liberty, while, all, libertarians, support, some, level, of, individual, rights, left, libertarians, differ, by, supporting, an, egalitarian, redistribution, of, natural, resources, left, libertarian, ideologies, include, anarchist, schools, of, thought, alongside, many, other, anti, paternalist, and, new, left, schools, of, thought, centered, around, economic, egalitarianism, as, well, as, geolibertarianism, green, politics, market, oriented, left, libertarianism, and, the, steiner, vallentyne, school, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, libertarian, socialism, grew, in, popularity, and, influence, as, part, of, anti, war, anti, capitalist, and, anti, and, alter, globalisation, movements, in, the, mid, 20th, century, american, right, libertarian, proponents, of, anarcho, capitalism, and, minarchism, co, opted, the, term, libertarian, to, advocate, laissez, faire, capitalism, and, strong, private, property, rights, such, as, in, land, infrastructure, and, natural, resources, the, latter, is, the, dominant, form, of, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, this, libertarianism, a, revival, of, classical, liberalism, in, the, united, states, occurred, due, to, other, american, liberals, abandoning, classical, liberalism, and, embracing, progressivism, and, economic, interventionism, in, the, early, 20th, century, after, the, great, depression, and, with, the, new, deal, since, the, 1970s, this, classical, liberal, form, of, libertarianism, has, spread, beyond, the, united, states, with, right, libertarian, parties, being, established, in, the, united, kingdom, israel, south, africa, argentina, and, many, other, countries, minarchists, advocate, for, night, watchman, states, which, maintain, only, those, functions, of, government, necessary, to, safeguard, natural, rights, understood, in, terms, of, self, ownership, or, autonomy, while, anarcho, capitalists, advocate, for, the, replacement, of, all, state, institutions, with, private, institutions, some, right, wing, variants, of, libertarianism, such, as, anarcho, capitalism, have, been, labeled, as, far, right, or, radical, right, by, some, scholars, in, 2022, student, activist, and, self, described, libertarian, socialist, gabriel, boric, became, head, of, state, of, chile, after, winning, the, 2021, chilean, presidential, election, with, the, apruebo, dignidad, coalition, in, 2023, argentine, economist, javier, milei, became, the, first, openly, right, wing, libertarian, head, of, state, after, winning, that, year, s, general, election, with, the, la, libertad, avanza, coalition, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, libertarian, was, in, 1789, when, william, belsham, wrote, about, libertarianism, in, the, context, of, metaphysics, as, early, as, 1796, libertarian, came, to, mean, an, advocate, or, defender, of, liberty, especially, in, the, political, and, social, spheres, when, the, london, packet, printed, on, 12, february, the, following, lately, marched, out, of, the, prison, at, bristol, 450, of, the, french, libertarians, it, was, again, used, in, a, political, sense, in, 1802, in, a, short, piece, critiquing, a, poem, by, the, author, of, gebir, and, has, since, been, used, with, this, meaning, the, use, of, the, term, libertarian, to, describe, a, new, set, of, political, positions, has, been, traced, to, the, french, cognate, libertaire, coined, in, a, letter, french, libertarian, communist, joseph, d, jacque, wrote, to, mutualist, pierre, joseph, proudhon, in, 1857, d, jacque, also, used, the, term, for, his, anarchist, publication, le, libertaire, journal, du, mouvement, social, libertarian, journal, of, social, movement, which, was, printed, from, 9, june, 1858, to, 4, february, 1861, in, new, york, city, s, bastien, faure, another, french, libertarian, communist, began, publishing, a, new, le, libertaire, in, the, mid, 1890s, while, france, s, third, republic, enacted, the, so, called, villainous, laws, lois, sc, l, rates, which, banned, anarchist, publications, in, france, libertarianism, has, frequently, been, used, to, refer, to, anarchism, and, libertarian, socialism, since, this, time, in, the, united, states, libertarian, was, popularized, by, the, individualist, anarchist, benjamin, tucker, around, the, late, 1870s, and, early, 1880s, libertarianism, as, a, synonym, for, liberalism, was, popularized, in, may, 1955, by, writer, dean, russell, a, colleague, of, leonard, read, and, a, classical, liberal, himself, russell, justified, the, choice, of, the, term, as, follows, many, of, us, call, ourselves, liberals, and, it, is, true, that, the, word, liberal, once, described, persons, who, respected, the, individual, and, feared, the, use, of, mass, compulsions, but, the, leftists, have, now, corrupted, that, once, proud, term, to, identify, themselves, and, their, program, of, more, government, ownership, of, property, and, more, controls, over, persons, as, a, result, those, of, us, who, believe, in, freedom, must, explain, that, when, we, call, ourselves, liberals, we, mean, liberals, in, the, uncorrupted, classical, sense, at, best, this, is, awkward, and, subject, to, misunderstanding, here, is, a, suggestion, let, those, of, us, who, love, liberty, trade, mark, and, reserve, for, our, own, use, the, good, and, honorable, word, libertarian, subsequently, a, growing, number, of, americans, with, classical, liberal, beliefs, began, to, describe, themselves, as, libertarians, one, person, responsible, for, popularizing, the, term, libertarian, in, this, sense, was, murray, rothbard, who, started, publishing, libertarian, works, in, the, 1960s, rothbard, described, this, modern, use, of, the, words, overtly, as, a, capture, from, his, enemies, writing, that, for, the, first, time, in, my, memory, we, our, side, had, captured, a, crucial, word, from, the, enemy, libertarians, had, long, been, simply, a, polite, word, for, left, wing, anarchists, that, is, for, anti, private, property, anarchists, either, of, the, communist, or, syndicalist, variety, but, now, we, had, taken, it, over, in, the, 1970s, robert, nozick, was, responsible, for, popularizing, this, usage, of, the, term, in, academic, and, philosophical, circles, outside, the, united, states, especially, with, the, publication, of, anarchy, state, and, utopia, 1974, a, response, to, social, liberal, john, rawls, s, a, theory, of, justice, 1971, in, the, book, nozick, proposed, a, minimal, state, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, an, inevitable, phenomenon, which, could, arise, without, violating, individual, rights, according, to, common, united, states, meanings, of, conservative, and, liberal, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, has, been, described, as, conservative, on, economic, issues, economic, liberalism, and, fiscal, conservatism, and, liberal, on, personal, freedom, civil, libertarianism, and, cultural, liberalism, it, is, also, often, associated, with, a, foreign, policy, of, non, interventionism, although, libertarianism, originated, as, a, form, of, left, wing, politics, the, development, in, the, mid, 20th, century, of, modern, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, resulted, in, libertarianism, s, being, commonly, associated, with, right, wing, politics, as, well, as, viewed, by, many, as, neither, left, nor, right, wing, but, an, independent, pro, freedom, and, anti, authoritarian, philosophy, it, also, resulted, in, several, authors, and, political, scientists, using, two, or, more, categorizations, to, distinguish, libertarian, views, on, the, nature, of, property, and, capital, usually, along, left, right, or, socialist, capitalist, lines, right, libertarians, reject, the, label, due, to, its, association, with, conservatism, and, right, wing, politics, calling, themselves, simply, libertarians, while, proponents, of, free, market, anti, capitalism, in, the, united, states, consciously, label, themselves, as, left, libertarians, and, see, themselves, as, being, part, of, a, broad, libertarian, left, while, the, term, libertarian, has, been, largely, synonymous, with, anarchism, as, part, of, the, left, continuing, today, as, part, of, the, libertarian, left, in, opposition, to, the, moderate, left, such, as, social, democracy, or, authoritarian, and, statist, socialism, its, meaning, has, evolved, during, the, past, half, century, with, wider, adoption, by, ideologically, disparate, groups, including, some, viewed, as, right, wing, by, older, users, of, the, term, as, a, term, libertarian, can, include, both, the, new, left, marxists, who, do, not, associate, with, a, vanguard, party, and, extreme, liberals, primarily, concerned, with, civil, liberties, or, civil, libertarians, additionally, some, libertarians, use, the, term, libertarian, socialist, to, avoid, anarchism, s, negative, connotations, and, emphasize, its, connections, with, socialism, the, revival, of, free, market, ideologies, during, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, came, with, disagreement, over, what, to, call, the, movement, while, many, believers, in, free, markets, prefer, the, term, libertarian, many, conservative, libertarians, reject, the, term, s, association, with, the, 1960s, new, left, and, its, connotations, of, libertine, hedonism, the, movement, is, divided, over, the, use, of, conservatism, as, an, alternative, those, who, seek, both, economic, and, social, liberty, would, be, known, as, liberals, but, that, term, developed, associations, opposite, of, the, limited, government, low, taxation, minimal, state, advocated, by, the, movement, name, variants, of, the, free, market, revival, movement, include, classical, liberalism, economic, liberalism, free, market, liberalism, and, neoliberalism, as, a, term, libertarian, or, economic, libertarian, has, the, most, colloquial, acceptance, to, describe, a, member, of, the, movement, with, the, latter, term, being, based, on, both, the, ideology, s, primacy, of, economics, and, its, distinction, from, libertarians, of, the, new, left, while, both, historical, and, contemporary, libertarianism, share, general, antipathy, towards, power, by, government, authority, the, latter, exempts, power, wielded, through, free, market, capitalism, historically, libertarians, including, herbert, spencer, and, max, stirner, supported, the, protection, of, an, individual, s, freedom, from, powers, of, government, and, private, ownership, in, contrast, while, condemning, governmental, encroachment, on, personal, liberties, modern, american, libertarians, support, freedoms, on, the, basis, of, their, agreement, with, private, property, rights, the, abolishment, of, public, amenities, is, a, common, theme, in, modern, american, libertarian, writings, according, to, modern, american, libertarian, walter, block, left, libertarians, and, right, libertarians, agree, with, certain, libertarian, premises, but, where, differ, is, in, terms, of, the, logical, implications, of, these, founding, axioms, although, several, modern, american, libertarians, reject, the, political, spectrum, especially, the, left, right, political, spectrum, several, strands, of, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, and, right, libertarianism, have, been, described, as, being, right, wing, new, right, or, radical, right, and, reactionary, while, some, american, libertarians, such, as, walter, block, harry, browne, tibor, machan, justin, raimondo, leonard, read, and, murray, rothbard, deny, any, association, with, either, the, left, or, right, other, american, libertarians, such, as, kevin, carson, karl, hess, and, roderick, t, long, have, written, about, libertarianism, s, left, wing, opposition, to, authoritarian, rule, and, argued, that, libertarianism, is, fundamentally, a, left, wing, position, rothbard, himself, previously, made, the, same, point, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, defines, libertarianism, as, the, moral, view, that, agents, initially, fully, own, themselves, and, have, certain, moral, powers, to, acquire, property, rights, in, external, things, libertarian, historian, george, woodcock, defines, libertarianism, as, the, philosophy, that, fundamentally, doubts, authority, and, advocates, transforming, society, by, reform, or, revolution, libertarian, philosopher, roderick, t, long, defines, libertarianism, as, any, political, position, that, advocates, a, radical, redistribution, of, power, from, the, coercive, state, to, voluntary, associations, of, free, individuals, whether, voluntary, association, takes, the, form, of, the, free, market, or, of, communal, co, operatives, according, to, the, american, libertarian, party, libertarianism, is, the, advocacy, of, a, government, that, is, funded, voluntarily, and, limited, to, protecting, individuals, from, coercion, and, violence, according, to, the, internet, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, iep, what, it, means, to, be, a, libertarian, in, a, political, sense, is, a, contentious, issue, especially, among, libertarians, themselves, nevertheless, all, libertarians, begin, with, a, conception, of, personal, autonomy, from, which, they, argue, in, favor, of, civil, liberties, and, a, reduction, or, elimination, of, the, state, people, described, as, being, left, libertarian, or, right, libertarian, generally, tend, to, call, themselves, simply, libertarians, and, refer, to, their, philosophy, as, libertarianism, as, a, result, some, political, scientists, and, writers, classify, the, forms, of, libertarianism, into, two, or, more, groups, to, distinguish, libertarian, views, on, the, nature, of, property, and, capital, in, the, united, states, proponents, of, free, market, anti, capitalism, consciously, label, themselves, as, left, libertarians, and, see, themselves, as, being, part, of, a, broad, libertarian, left, libertarianism, is, a, heory, upholding, rights, above, all, else, and, seeks, to, reduce, the, power, of, a, state, or, states, especially, ones, a, libertarian, lives, in, or, is, closely, associated, with, to, safeguard, and, maintain, individualism, libertarians, argue, that, some, forms, of, order, within, society, emerge, spontaneously, from, the, actions, of, many, different, individuals, acting, independently, from, one, another, without, any, central, planning, proposed, examples, of, systems, which, evolved, through, spontaneous, order, or, self, organization, include, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, language, crystal, structure, the, internet, wikipedia, workers, councils, horizontalidad, and, a, free, market, economy, left, libertarianism, encompasses, those, libertarian, beliefs, that, claim, the, earth, s, natural, resources, belong, to, everyone, in, an, egalitarian, manner, either, unowned, or, owned, collectively, contemporary, left, libertarians, such, as, hillel, steiner, peter, vallentyne, philippe, van, parijs, michael, otsuka, and, david, ellerman, believe, the, appropriation, of, land, must, leave, enough, and, as, good, for, others, or, be, taxed, by, society, to, compensate, for, the, exclusionary, effects, of, private, property, socialist, libertarians, such, as, social, and, individualist, anarchists, libertarian, marxists, council, communists, luxemburgists, and, de, leonists, promote, usufruct, and, socialist, economic, theories, including, communism, collectivism, syndicalism, and, mutualism, they, criticize, the, state, for, being, the, defender, of, private, property, and, believe, capitalism, entails, wage, slavery, and, another, form, of, coercion, and, domination, related, to, that, of, the, state, there, are, a, number, of, different, left, libertarian, positions, on, the, state, which, can, range, from, advocating, for, the, complete, abolition, of, the, state, to, advocating, for, a, more, decentralized, and, limited, government, with, social, ownership, of, the, economy, according, to, sheldon, richman, of, the, independent, institute, other, left, libertarians, prefer, that, corporate, privileges, be, repealed, before, the, regulatory, restrictions, on, how, those, privileges, may, be, exercised, right, libertarianism, developed, in, the, united, states, in, the, mid, 20th, century, from, the, works, of, european, writers, like, john, locke, friedrich, hayek, and, ludwig, von, mises, and, is, the, most, popular, conception, of, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, today, commonly, referred, to, as, a, continuation, or, radicalization, of, classical, liberalism, the, most, important, of, these, early, right, libertarian, philosophers, was, robert, nozick, while, sharing, left, libertarians, advocacy, for, social, freedom, right, libertarians, value, the, social, institutions, that, enforce, conditions, of, capitalism, while, rejecting, institutions, that, function, in, opposition, to, these, on, the, grounds, that, such, interventions, represent, unnecessary, coercion, of, individuals, and, abrogation, of, their, economic, freedom, anarcho, capitalists, seek, the, elimination, of, the, state, in, favor, of, privately, funded, security, services, while, minarchists, defend, night, watchman, states, which, maintain, only, those, functions, of, government, necessary, to, safeguard, natural, rights, understood, in, terms, of, self, ownership, or, autonomy, libertarian, paternalism, is, a, position, advocated, in, the, international, bestseller, nudge, by, two, american, scholars, namely, the, economist, richard, thaler, and, the, jurist, cass, sunstein, in, the, book, thinking, fast, and, slow, daniel, kahneman, provides, the, brief, summary, thaler, and, sunstein, advocate, a, position, of, libertarian, paternalism, in, which, the, state, and, other, institutions, are, allowed, to, nudge, people, to, make, decisions, that, serve, their, own, long, term, interests, the, designation, of, joining, a, pension, plan, as, the, default, option, is, an, example, of, a, nudge, it, is, difficult, to, argue, that, anyone, s, freedom, is, diminished, by, being, automatically, enrolled, in, the, plan, when, they, merely, have, to, check, a, box, to, opt, out, nudge, is, considered, an, important, piece, of, literature, in, behavioral, economics, neo, libertarianism, combines, the, libertarian, s, moral, commitment, to, negative, liberty, with, a, procedure, that, selects, principles, for, restricting, liberty, on, the, basis, of, a, unanimous, agreement, in, which, everyone, s, particular, interests, receive, a, fair, hearing, neo, libertarianism, has, its, roots, at, least, as, far, back, as, 1980, when, it, was, first, described, by, the, american, philosopher, james, sterba, of, the, university, of, notre, dame, sterba, observed, that, libertarianism, advocates, for, a, government, that, does, no, more, than, protection, against, force, fraud, theft, enforcement, of, contracts, and, other, negative, liberties, as, contrasted, with, positive, liberties, by, isaiah, berlin, sterba, contrasted, this, with, the, older, libertarian, ideal, of, a, night, watchman, state, or, minarchism, sterba, held, that, it, is, obviously, impossible, for, everyone, in, society, to, be, guaranteed, complete, liberty, as, defined, by, this, ideal, after, all, people, s, actual, wants, as, well, as, their, conceivable, wants, can, come, into, serious, conflict, t, is, also, impossible, for, everyone, in, society, to, be, completely, free, from, the, interference, of, other, persons, in, 2013, sterna, wrote, that, i, shall, show, that, moral, commitment, to, an, ideal, of, negative, liberty, which, does, not, lead, to, a, night, watchman, state, but, instead, requires, sufficient, government, to, provide, each, person, in, society, with, the, relatively, high, minimum, of, liberty, that, persons, using, rawls, decision, procedure, would, select, the, political, program, actually, justified, by, an, ideal, of, negative, liberty, i, shall, call, neo, libertarianism, libertarian, populism, combines, libertarian, and, populist, politics, according, to, jesse, walker, writing, in, the, libertarian, magazine, reason, libertarian, populists, oppose, big, government, while, also, opposing, other, large, centralized, institutions, and, advocate, tak, an, axe, to, the, thicket, of, corporate, subsidies, favors, and, bailouts, clearing, our, way, to, an, economy, where, businesses, that, can, t, make, money, serving, customers, don, t, have, the, option, of, wringing, profits, from, the, taxpayers, instead, in, the, united, states, libertarian, is, a, typology, used, to, describe, a, political, position, that, advocates, small, government, and, is, culturally, liberal, and, fiscally, conservative, in, a, two, dimensional, political, spectrum, such, as, the, libertarian, inspired, nolan, chart, where, the, other, major, typologies, are, conservative, liberal, and, populist, libertarians, support, legalization, of, victimless, crimes, such, as, the, use, of, marijuana, while, opposing, high, levels, of, taxation, and, government, spending, on, health, welfare, and, education, libertarians, also, support, a, foreign, policy, of, non, interventionism, libertarian, was, adopted, in, the, united, states, where, liberal, had, become, associated, with, a, version, that, supports, extensive, government, spending, on, social, policies, libertarian, may, also, refer, to, an, anarchist, ideology, that, developed, in, the, 19th, century, and, to, a, liberal, version, which, developed, in, the, united, states, that, is, avowedly, pro, capitalist, according, to, polls, approximately, one, in, four, americans, self, identify, as, libertarian, while, this, group, is, not, typically, ideologically, driven, the, term, libertarian, is, commonly, used, to, describe, the, form, of, libertarianism, widely, practiced, in, the, united, states, and, is, the, common, meaning, of, the, word, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, this, form, is, often, named, liberalism, elsewhere, such, as, in, europe, where, liberalism, has, a, different, common, meaning, than, in, the, united, states, in, some, academic, circles, this, form, is, called, right, libertarianism, as, a, complement, to, left, libertarianism, with, acceptance, of, capitalism, or, the, private, ownership, of, land, as, being, the, distinguishing, feature, elements, of, libertarianism, can, be, traced, back, to, the, higher, law, concepts, of, the, greeks, and, the, israelites, and, christian, theologians, who, argued, for, the, moral, worth, of, the, individual, and, the, division, of, the, world, into, two, realms, one, of, which, is, the, province, of, god, and, thus, beyond, the, power, of, states, to, control, it, the, right, libertarian, economist, murray, rothbard, suggested, that, chinese, taoist, philosopher, laozi, was, the, first, libertarian, likening, laozi, s, ideas, on, government, to, friedrich, hayek, s, theory, of, spontaneous, order, similarly, the, cato, institute, s, david, boaz, includes, passages, from, the, tao, te, ching, in, his, 1997, book, the, libertarian, reader, and, noted, in, an, article, for, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, that, laozi, advocated, for, rulers, to, do, nothing, because, without, law, or, compulsion, men, would, dwell, in, harmony, libertarianism, was, influenced, by, debates, within, scholasticism, regarding, private, property, and, slavery, scholastic, thinkers, including, thomas, aquinas, francisco, de, vitoria, and, bartolom, de, las, casas, argued, for, the, concept, of, self, mastery, as, the, foundation, of, a, system, supporting, individual, rights, early, christian, sects, such, as, the, waldensians, displayed, libertarian, attitudes, in, 17th, century, england, libertarian, ideas, began, to, take, modern, form, in, the, writings, of, the, levellers, and, john, locke, in, the, middle, of, that, century, opponents, of, royal, power, began, to, be, called, whigs, or, sometimes, simply, opposition, or, country, as, opposed, to, court, writers, during, the, 18th, century, and, age, of, enlightenment, liberal, ideas, flourished, in, europe, and, north, america, libertarians, of, various, schools, were, influenced, by, liberal, ideas, for, philosopher, roderick, t, long, libertarians, share, a, common, or, at, least, an, overlapping, intellectual, ancestry, claim, the, seventeenth, century, english, levellers, and, the, eighteenth, century, french, encyclopedists, among, their, ideological, forebears, and, usually, share, an, admiration, for, thomas, jefferson, and, thomas, paine, john, locke, greatly, influenced, both, libertarianism, and, the, modern, world, in, his, writings, published, before, and, after, the, english, revolution, of, 1688, especially, a, letter, concerning, toleration, 1667, two, treatises, of, government, 1689, and, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1690, in, the, text, of, 1689, he, established, the, basis, of, liberal, political, theory, i, e, that, people, s, rights, existed, before, government, that, the, purpose, of, government, is, to, protect, personal, and, property, rights, that, people, may, dissolve, governments, that, do, not, do, so, and, that, representative, government, is, the, best, form, to, protect, rights, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, was, inspired, by, locke, in, its, statement, o, secure, these, rights, governments, are, instituted, among, men, deriving, their, just, powers, from, the, consent, of, the, governed, that, whenever, any, form, of, government, becomes, destructive, of, these, ends, it, is, the, right, of, the, people, to, alter, or, to, abolish, it, according, to, american, historian, bernard, bailyn, during, and, after, the, american, revolution, the, major, themes, of, eighteenth, century, libertarianism, were, brought, to, realization, in, constitutions, bills, of, rights, and, limits, on, legislative, and, executive, powers, including, limits, on, starting, wars, according, to, murray, rothbard, the, libertarian, creed, emerged, from, the, liberal, challenges, to, an, absolute, central, state, and, a, king, ruling, by, divine, right, on, top, of, an, older, restrictive, web, of, feudal, land, monopolies, and, urban, guild, controls, and, restrictions, as, well, as, the, mercantilism, of, a, bureaucratic, warfaring, state, allied, with, privileged, merchants, the, object, of, liberals, was, individual, liberty, in, the, economy, in, personal, freedoms, and, civil, liberty, separation, of, state, and, religion, and, peace, as, an, alternative, to, imperial, aggrandizement, he, cites, locke, s, contemporaries, the, levellers, who, held, similar, views, also, influential, were, the, english, cato, s, letters, during, the, early, 1700s, reprinted, eagerly, by, american, colonists, who, already, were, free, of, european, aristocracy, and, feudal, land, monopolies, in, january, 1776, only, two, years, after, coming, to, america, from, england, thomas, paine, published, his, pamphlet, common, sense, calling, for, independence, for, the, colonies, paine, promoted, liberal, ideas, in, clear, and, concise, language, that, allowed, the, general, public, to, understand, the, debates, among, the, political, elites, common, sense, was, immensely, popular, in, disseminating, these, ideas, selling, hundreds, of, thousands, of, copies, paine, would, later, write, the, rights, of, man, and, the, age, of, reason, and, participate, in, the, french, revolution, paine, s, theory, of, property, showed, a, libertarian, concern, with, the, redistribution, of, resources, in, 1793, william, godwin, wrote, a, libertarian, philosophical, treatise, titled, enquiry, concerning, political, justice, and, its, influence, on, morals, and, happiness, which, criticized, ideas, of, human, rights, and, of, society, by, contract, based, on, vague, promises, he, took, liberalism, to, its, logical, anarchic, conclusion, by, rejecting, all, political, institutions, law, government, and, apparatus, of, coercion, as, well, as, all, political, protest, and, insurrection, instead, of, institutionalized, justice, godwin, proposed, that, people, influence, one, another, to, moral, goodness, through, informal, reasoned, persuasion, including, in, the, associations, they, joined, as, this, would, facilitate, happiness, anarchist, communist, philosopher, joseph, d, jacque, was, the, first, person, to, describe, himself, as, a, libertarian, in, an, 1857, letter, unlike, mutualist, anarchist, philosopher, pierre, joseph, proudhon, he, argued, that, it, is, not, the, product, of, his, or, her, labor, that, the, worker, has, a, right, to, but, to, the, satisfaction, of, his, or, her, needs, whatever, may, be, their, nature, according, to, anarchist, historian, max, nettlau, the, first, use, of, the, term, libertarian, communism, was, in, november, 1880, when, a, french, anarchist, congress, employed, it, to, identify, its, doctrines, more, clearly, the, french, anarchist, journalist, s, bastien, faure, started, the, weekly, paper, le, libertaire, the, libertarian, in, 1895, the, revolutionary, wave, of, 1917, 1923, saw, the, active, participation, of, anarchists, in, russia, and, europe, russian, anarchists, participated, alongside, the, bolsheviks, in, both, the, february, and, october, 1917, revolutions, however, bolsheviks, in, central, russia, quickly, began, to, imprison, or, drive, underground, the, libertarian, anarchists, many, fled, to, ukraine, after, the, anarchist, makhnovshchina, helped, stave, off, the, white, movement, during, the, russian, civil, war, the, bolsheviks, turned, on, the, makkhnovists, and, contributed, to, the, schism, between, the, anarcho, syndicalists, and, the, communists, with, the, rise, of, fascism, in, europe, between, the, 1920s, and, the, 1930s, anarchists, began, to, fight, fascists, in, italy, in, france, during, the, february, 1934, riots, and, in, spain, where, the, cnt, confederaci, n, nacional, del, trabajo, boycott, of, elections, led, to, a, right, wing, victory, and, its, later, participation, in, voting, in, 1936, helped, bring, the, popular, front, back, to, power, this, led, to, a, ruling, class, attempted, coup, and, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, gruppo, comunista, anarchico, di, firenze, held, that, during, the, early, twentieth, century, the, terms, libertarian, communism, and, anarchist, communism, became, synonymous, within, the, international, anarchist, movement, as, a, result, of, the, close, connection, they, had, in, spain, anarchism, in, spain, with, libertarian, communism, becoming, the, prevalent, term, libertarian, socialism, reached, its, apex, of, popularity, with, the, spanish, revolution, of, 1936, during, which, libertarian, socialists, led, the, largest, and, most, successful, revolution, against, capitalism, to, ever, take, place, in, any, industrial, economy, during, the, revolution, the, means, of, production, were, brought, under, workers, control, and, worker, cooperatives, formed, the, basis, for, the, new, economy, according, to, gaston, leval, the, cnt, established, an, agrarian, federation, in, the, levante, that, encompassed, 78, of, spain, s, most, arable, land, the, regional, federation, was, populated, by, 1, 650, 000, people, 40, of, whom, lived, on, the, region, s, 900, agrarian, collectives, which, were, self, organised, by, peasant, unions, although, industrial, and, agricultural, production, was, at, its, highest, in, the, anarchist, controlled, areas, of, the, spanish, republic, and, the, anarchist, militias, displayed, the, strongest, military, discipline, liberals, and, communists, alike, blamed, the, sectarian, libertarian, socialists, for, the, defeat, of, the, republic, in, the, spanish, civil, war, these, charges, have, been, disputed, by, contemporary, libertarian, socialists, such, as, robin, hahnel, and, noam, chomsky, who, have, accused, such, claims, of, lacking, substantial, evidence, during, the, autumn, of, 1931, the, manifesto, of, the, 30, was, published, by, militants, of, the, anarchist, trade, union, cnt, and, among, those, who, signed, it, there, was, the, cnt, general, secretary, 1922, 1923, joan, peiro, ngel, pesta, a, cnt, general, secretary, in, 1929, and, juan, lopez, sanchez,

french, platformist, anarcho, communist, daniel, gu, rin, published, an, essay, in, 1969, called, libertarian, marxism, in, which, he, dealt, with, the, debate, between, karl, marx, and, mikhail, bakunin, at, the, first, international, libertarian, marxist, currents, often, draw, from, marx, and, engels, later, works, specifically, the, grundrisse, and, the, civil, war, in, france, h, l, mencken, and, albert, jay, nock, were, the, first, prominent, figures, in, the, united, states, to, describe, themselves, as, libertarian, as, synonym, for, liberal, they, believed, that, franklin, d, roosevelt, had, co, opted, the, word, liberal, for, his, new, deal, policies, which, they, opposed, and, used, libertarian, to, signify, their, allegiance, to, classical, liberalism, individualism, and, limited, government, according, to, david, boaz, in, 1943, three, women, published, books, that, could, be, said, to, have, given, birth, to, the, modern, libertarian, movement, isabel, paterson, s, the, god, of, the, machine, rose, wilder, lane, s, the, discovery, of, freedom, and, ayn, rand, s, the, fountainhead, each, promoted, individualism, and, capitalism, none, of, the, three, used, the, term, libertarianism, to, describe, their, beliefs, and, rand, specifically, rejected, the, label, criticizing, the, burgeoning, american, libertarian, movement, as, the, hippies, of, the, right, rand, accused, libertarians, of, plagiarizing, ideas, related, to, her, own, philosophy, of, objectivism, and, yet, viciously, attacking, other, aspects, of, it, in, 1946, leonard, e, read, founded, the, foundation, for, economic, education, fee, an, american, nonprofit, educational, organization, which, promotes, the, principles, of, laissez, faire, economics, private, property, and, limited, government, according, to, gary, north, the, fee, is, the, granddaddy, of, all, libertarian, organizations, karl, hess, a, speechwriter, for, barry, goldwater, and, primary, author, of, the, republican, party, s, 1960, and, 1964, platforms, became, disillusioned, with, traditional, politics, following, the, 1964, presidential, campaign, in, which, goldwater, lost, to, lyndon, b, johnson, he, and, his, friend, murray, rothbard, an, austrian, school, economist, founded, the, journal, left, and, right, a, journal, of, libertarian, thought, which, was, published, from, 1965, to, 1968, with, george, resch, and, leonard, p, liggio, in, 1969, they, edited, the, libertarian, forum, which, hess, left, in, 1971, the, vietnam, war, split, the, uneasy, alliance, between, growing, numbers, of, american, libertarians, and, conservatives, who, believed, in, limiting, liberty, to, uphold, moral, virtues, libertarians, opposed, to, the, war, joined, the, draft, resistance, and, peace, movements, as, well, as, organizations, such, as, students, for, a, democratic, society, sds, in, 1969, and, 1970, hess, joined, with, others, including, murray, rothbard, robert, lefevre, dana, rohrabacher, samuel, edward, konkin, iii, and, former, sds, leader, carl, oglesby, to, speak, at, two, conferences, which, brought, together, activists, from, both, the, new, left, and, the, old, right, in, what, was, emerging, as, a, nascent, libertarian, movement, rothbard, ultimately, broke, with, the, left, allying, himself, with, the, burgeoning, paleoconservative, movement, he, criticized, the, tendency, of, these, libertarians, to, appeal, to, free, spirits, to, people, who, don, t, want, to, push, other, people, around, and, who, don, t, want, to, be, pushed, around, themselves, in, contrast, to, the, bulk, of, americans, who, might, well, be, tight, assed, conformists, who, want, to, stamp, out, drugs, in, their, vicinity, kick, out, people, with, strange, dress, habits, etc, rothbard, emphasized, that, this, was, relevant, as, a, matter, of, strategy, as, the, failure, to, pitch, the, libertarian, message, to, middle, america, might, result, in, the, loss, of, the, tight, assed, majority, this, left, libertarian, tradition, has, been, carried, to, the, present, day, by, konkin, s, agorists, contemporary, mutualists, such, as, kevin, carson, roderick, t, long, and, others, such, as, gary, chartier, charles, w, johnson, sheldon, richman, chris, matthew, sciabarra, and, brad, spangler, in, 1971, a, small, group, led, by, david, nolan, formed, the, libertarian, party, which, has, run, a, presidential, candidate, every, election, year, since, 1972, other, libertarian, organizations, such, as, the, center, for, libertarian, studies, and, the, cato, institute, were, also, formed, in, the, 1970s, philosopher, john, hospers, a, one, time, member, of, rand, s, inner, circle, proposed, a, non, initiation, of, force, principle, to, unite, both, groups, but, this, statement, later, became, a, required, pledge, for, candidates, of, the, libertarian, party, and, hospers, became, its, first, presidential, candidate, in, 1972, modern, libertarianism, gained, significant, recognition, in, academia, with, the, publication, of, harvard, university, professor, robert, nozick, s, anarchy, state, and, utopia, in, 1974, for, which, he, received, a, national, book, award, in, 1975, in, response, to, john, rawls, a, theory, of, justice, nozick, s, book, supported, a, minimal, state, also, called, a, nightwatchman, state, by, nozick, on, the, grounds, that, the, ultraminimal, state, arises, without, violating, individual, rights, and, the, transition, from, an, ultraminimal, state, to, a, minimal, state, is, morally, obligated, to, occur, in, the, early, 1970s, rothbard, wrote, one, gratifying, aspect, of, our, rise, to, some, prominence, is, that, for, the, first, time, in, my, memory, we, our, side, had, captured, a, crucial, word, from, the, enemy, libertarians, had, long, been, simply, a, polite, word, for, left, wing, anarchists, that, is, for, anti, private, property, anarchists, either, of, the, communist, or, syndicalist, variety, but, now, we, had, taken, it, over, the, project, of, spreading, libertarian, ideals, in, the, united, states, has, been, so, successful, that, some, americans, who, do, not, identify, as, libertarian, seem, to, hold, libertarian, views, since, the, resurgence, of, neoliberalism, in, the, 1970s, this, modern, american, libertarianism, has, spread, beyond, north, america, via, think, tanks, and, political, parties, in, a, 1975, interview, with, reason, california, governor, ronald, reagan, appealed, to, libertarians, when, he, stated, to, believe, the, very, heart, and, soul, of, conservatism, is, libertarianism, libertarian, republican, ron, paul, supported, reagan, s, 1980, presidential, campaign, being, one, of, the, first, elected, officials, in, the, nation, to, support, his, campaign, and, actively, campaigned, for, reagan, in, 1976, and, 1980, however, paul, quickly, became, disillusioned, with, the, reagan, administration, s, policies, after, reagan, s, election, in, 1980, and, later, recalled, being, the, only, republican, to, vote, against, reagan, budget, proposals, in, 1981, in, the, 1980s, libertarians, such, as, paul, and, rothbard, criticized, president, reagan, reaganomics, and, policies, of, the, reagan, administration, for, among, other, reasons, having, turned, the, united, states, big, trade, deficit, into, debt, and, the, united, states, became, a, debtor, nation, for, the, first, time, since, world, war, i, under, the, reagan, administration, rothbard, argued, that, the, presidency, of, reagan, has, been, a, disaster, for, libertarianism, in, the, united, states, and, paul, described, reagan, himself, as, a, dramatic, failure, a, surge, of, popular, interest, in, libertarian, socialism, occurred, in, western, nations, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, anarchism, was, influential, in, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, and, anarchists, actively, participated, in, the, protests, of, 1968, which, included, students, and, workers, revolts, in, 1968, the, international, of, anarchist, federations, was, founded, in, carrara, italy, during, an, international, anarchist, conference, held, there, in, 1968, by, the, three, existing, european, federations, of, france, the, italian, and, the, iberian, anarchist, federation, as, well, as, the, bulgarian, anarchist, federation, in, french, exile, around, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, libertarian, socialism, grew, in, popularity, and, influence, as, part, of, the, anti, war, anti, capitalist, and, anti, globalisation, movements, anarchists, became, known, for, their, involvement, in, protests, against, the, meetings, of, the, world, trade, organization, wto, group, of, eight, and, the, world, economic, forum, some, anarchist, factions, at, these, protests, engaged, in, rioting, property, destruction, and, violent, confrontations, with, police, these, actions, were, precipitated, by, ad, hoc, leaderless, anonymous, cadres, known, as, black, blocs, and, other, organizational, tactics, pioneered, in, this, time, include, security, culture, affinity, groups, and, the, use, of, decentralized, technologies, such, as, the, internet, a, significant, event, of, this, period, was, the, confrontations, at, wto, conference, in, seattle, in, 1999, for, english, anarchist, scholar, simon, critchley, contemporary, anarchism, can, be, seen, as, a, powerful, critique, of, the, pseudo, libertarianism, of, contemporary, neo, liberalism, one, might, say, that, contemporary, anarchism, is, about, responsibility, whether, sexual, ecological, or, socio, economic, it, flows, from, an, experience, of, conscience, about, the, manifold, ways, in, which, the, west, ravages, the, rest, it, is, an, ethical, outrage, at, the, yawning, inequality, impoverishment, and, disenfranchisment, that, is, so, palpable, locally, and, globally, this, might, also, have, been, motivated, by, the, collapse, of, really, existing, socialism, and, the, capitulation, to, neo, liberalism, of, western, social, democracy, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, there, have, been, at, least, two, major, experiments, in, libertarian, socialism, the, zapatista, uprising, in, mexico, during, which, the, zapatista, army, of, national, liberation, ezln, enabled, the, formation, of, a, self, governing, autonomous, territory, in, the, mexican, state, of, chiapas, and, the, rojava, revolution, in, syria, which, established, the, autonomous, administration, of, north, and, east, syria, aanes, as, a, libertarian, socialist, alternative, to, the, colonially, established, state, boundaries, in, the, middle, east, in, 2022, student, activist, and, self, described, libertarian, socialist, gabriel, boric, became, head, of, state, of, chile, after,

the, political, spectrum, ranged, from, 17, 23, of, the, united, states, electorate, however, a, 2014, pew, poll, found, that, 23, of, americans, who, identify, as, libertarians, have, no, idea, what,

nationalism, and, social, issues, a, 2011, reason, rupe, poll, found, that, among, those, who, self, identified, as, tea, party, supporters, 41, percent, leaned, libertarian, and, 59, percent,
