by, a, population, of, about, 515, million, people, mainly, in, europe, north, america, oceania, and, southern, africa, the, most, widely, spoken, germanic, language, english, is, also, the, world, s, most, widely, spoken, language, with, an, estimated, 2, billion, speakers, all, germanic, languages, are, derived, from, proto, germanic, spoken, in, iron, age, scandinavia, iron, age, northern, germany, and, along, the, north, sea, and, baltic, coasts, the, west, germanic, languages, include, the, three, most, widely, spoken, germanic, languages, english, with, around, 360, 400, million, native, speakers, german, with, over, 100, million, native, speakers, and, dutch, with, 24, million, native, speakers, other, west, germanic, languages, include, afrikaans, an, offshoot, of, dutch, originating, from, the, afrikaners, of, south, africa, with, over, 7, 1, million, native, speakers, low, german, considered, a, separate, collection, of, unstandardized, dialects, with, roughly, 4, 35, 7, 15, million, native, speakers, and, probably, 6, 7, 10, million, people, who, can, understand, it, at, least, 2, 2, million, in, germany, 2016, and, 2, 15, million, in, the, netherlands, 2003,

by, linguists, the, total, number, of, germanic, languages, throughout, history, is, unknown, as, some, of, them, especially, the, east, germanic, languages, disappeared, during, or, after, the, migration, period, some, of, the, west, germanic, languages, also, did, not, survive, past, the, migration, period, including, lombardic, as, a, result, of, world, war, ii, and, subsequent, mass, expulsion, of, germans, the, german, language, suffered, a, significant, loss, of, sprachraum, as, well, as, moribundity, and, extinction, of, several, of, its, dialects, in, the, 21st, century,

languages, are, thought, to, be, descended, from, a, hypothetical, proto, germanic, united, by, subjection, to, the, sound, shifts, of, grimm, s, law, and, verner, s, law, these, probably, took, place, during, the, pre, roman, iron, age, of, northern, europe, from, c, 500, bc, proto, germanic, itself, was, likely, spoken, after, c, 500, bc, and, proto, norse, from, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, later, is, still, quite, close, to, reconstructed, proto, germanic, but, other, common, innovations, separating, germanic, from, proto, indo, european, suggest, a, common, history, of, pre, proto, germanic, speakers, throughout, the, nordic, bronze, age, from, the, time, of, their, earliest, attestation, the, germanic, varieties, are, divided, into, three, groups, west, east, and, north, germanic, their, exact, relation, is, difficult, to, determine, from, the, sparse, evidence, of, runic, inscriptions, the, western, group, would, have, formed, in, the, late, jastorf, culture, and, the, eastern, group, may, be, derived, from, the, 1st, century, variety, of, gotland, leaving, southern, sweden, as, the, original, location, of, the, northern, group, the, earliest, period, of, elder, futhark, 2nd, to, 4th, centuries, predates, the, division, in, regional, script, variants, and, linguistically, essentially, still, reflects, the, common, germanic, stage, the, vimose, inscriptions, include, some, of, the, oldest, datable, germanic, inscriptions, starting, in, c, 160, ad, the, earliest, coherent, germanic, text, preserved, is, the, 4th, century, gothic, translation,

texts, in, the, latin, alphabet, survive, from, the, 12th, century, slendingab, k, and, some, skaldic, poetry, dates, back, to, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, by, about, the, 10th, century, the, varieties, had, diverged, enough, to, make, mutual, intelligibility, difficult, the, linguistic, contact, of, the, viking, settlers, of, the, danelaw, with, the, anglo, saxons, left, traces, in, the, english, language, and, is, suspected, to, have, facilitated, the, collapse, of, old, english, grammar, that, combined, with, the, influx, of, romance, old, french, vocabulary, after, the, norman, conquest, resulted, in, middle, english, from, the, 12th, century, the, east, germanic, languages, were, marginalized, from, the, end, of, the, migration, period, the, burgundians, goths, and, vandals, became, linguistically, assimilated, by, their, respective, neighbors, by, about, the, 7th, century, with, only, crimean, gothic, lingering, on, until, the, 18th, century, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, west, germanic, languages, were, separated, by, the, insular, development, of, middle, english, on, one, hand, and, by, the, high, german, consonant, shift, on, the, continent, on, the, other, resulting, in, upper, german, and, low, saxon, with, graded, intermediate, central, german, varieties, by, early, modern, times, the, span, had, extended, into, considerable, differences, ranging, from, highest, alemannic, in, the, south, to, northern, low, saxon, in, the, north, and, although, both, extremes, are, considered, german, they, are, hardly, mutually, intelligible, the, southernmost, varieties, had, completed, the, second, sound, shift, while, the, northern, varieties, remained, unaffected, by, the, consonant, shift, the, north, germanic, languages, on, the, other, hand, remained, unified, until, well, past, 1000, ad, and, in, fact, the, mainland, scandinavian, languages, still, largely, retain, mutual, intelligibility, into, modern, times, the, main, split, in, these, languages, is, between, the, mainland, languages, and, the, island, languages, to, the, west, especially, icelandic, which, has, maintained, the, grammar, of, old, norse, virtually, unchanged, while, the, mainland, languages, have, diverged, greatly, germanic, languages, possess, a, number, of, defining, features, compared, with, other, indo, european, languages, some, of, the, best, known, are, the, following, other, significant, characteristics, are, some, of, the, characteristics, present, in, germanic, languages, were, not, present, in, proto, germanic, but, developed, later, as, areal, features, that, spread, from, language, to, language, roughly, speaking, germanic, languages, differ, in, how, conservative, or, how, progressive, each, language, is, with, respect, to, an, overall, trend, toward, analyticity, some, such, as, icelandic, and, to, a, lesser, extent, german, have, preserved, much, of, the, complex, inflectional, morphology, inherited, from, proto, germanic, and, in, turn, from, proto, indo, european, others, such, as, english, swedish, and, afrikaans, have, moved, toward, a, largely, analytic, type, the, subgroupings, of, the, germanic, languages, are, defined, by, shared, innovations, it, is, important, to, distinguish, innovations, from, cases, of, linguistic, conservatism, that, is, if, two, languages, in, a, family, share, a, characteristic, that, is, not, observed, in, a, third, language, that, is, evidence, of, common, ancestry, of, the, two, languages, only, if, the, characteristic, is, an, innovation, compared, to, the, family, s, proto, language, the, following, innovations, are, common, to, the, northwest, germanic, languages, all, but, gothic, the, following, innovations, are, also, common, to, the, northwest, germanic, languages, but, represent, areal, changes, the, following, innovations, are, common, to, the, west, germanic, languages, the, following, innovations, are, common, to, the, ingvaeonic, subgroup, of, the, west, germanic, languages, which, includes, english, frisian, and, in, a, few, cases, dutch, and, low, german, but, not, high, german, the, following, innovations, are, common, to, the, anglo, frisian, subgroup, of, the, ingvaeonic, languages, the, oldest, germanic, languages, all, share, a, number, of, features, which, are, assumed, to, be, inherited, from, proto, germanic, phonologically, it, includes, the, important, sound, changes, known, as, grimm, s, law, and, verner, s, law, which, introduced, a, large, number, of, fricatives, late, proto, indo, european, had, only, one, s, the, main, vowel, developments, are, the, merging, in, most, circumstances, of, long, and, short, a, and, o, producing, short, a, and, long, that, likewise, affected, the, diphthongs, with, pie, ai, and, oi, merging, into, ai, and, pie, au, and, ou, merging, into, au, pie, ei, developed, into, long, pie, long, developed, into, a, vowel, denoted, as, 1, often, assumed, to, be, phonetically, while, a, new, fairly, uncommon, long, vowel, 2, developed, in, varied, and, not, completely, understood, circumstances, proto, germanic, had, no, front, rounded, vowels, but, all, germanic, languages, except, for, gothic, subsequently, developed, them, through, the, process, of, i, umlaut, proto, germanic, developed, a, strong, stress, accent, on, the, first, syllable, of, the, root, but, remnants, of, the, original, free, pie, accent, are, visible, due, to, verner, s, law, which, was, sensitive, to, this, accent, that, caused, a, steady, erosion, of, vowels, in, unstressed, syllables, in, proto, germanic, that, had, progressed, only, to, the, point, that, absolutely, final, short, vowels, other, than, i, and, u, were, lost, and, absolutely, final, long, vowels, were, shortened, but, all, of, the, early, literary, languages, show, a, more, advanced, state, of, vowel, loss, this, ultimately, resulted, in, some, languages, like, modern, english, losing, practically, all, vowels, following, the, main, stress, and, the, consequent, rise, of, a, very, large, number, of, monosyllabic, words, the, following, table, shows, the, main, outcomes, of, proto, germanic, vowels, and, consonants, in, the, various, older, languages, for, vowels, only, the, outcomes, in, stressed, syllables, are, shown, outcomes, in, unstressed, syllables, are, quite, different, vary, from, language, to, language, and, depend, on, a, number, of, other, factors, such, as, whether, the, syllable, was, medial, or, final, whether, the, syllable, was, open, or, closed, and, in, some, cases, whether, the, preceding, syllable, was, light, or, heavy, notes, the, oldest, germanic, languages, have, the, typical, complex, inflected, morphology, of, old, indo, european, languages, with, four, or, five, noun, cases, verbs, marked, for, person, number, tense, and, mood, multiple, noun, and, verb, classes, few, or, no, articles, and, rather, free, word, order, the, old, germanic, languages, are, famous, for, having, only, two, tenses, present, and, past, with, three, pie, past, tense, aspects, imperfect, aorist, and, perfect, stative, merged, into, one, and, no, new, tenses, future, pluperfect, etc, developing, there, were, three, moods, indicative, subjunctive, developed, from, the, pie, optative, mood, and, imperative, gothic, verbs, had, a, number, of, archaic, features, inherited, from, pie, that, were, lost, in, the, other, germanic, languages, with, few, traces, including, dual, endings, an, inflected, passive, voice, derived, from, the, pie, mediopassive, voice, and, a, class, of, verbs, with, reduplication, in, the, past, tense, derived, from, the, pie, perfect, the, complex, tense, system, of, modern, english, e, g, in, three, months, the, house, will, still, be, being, built, or, if, you, had, not, acted, so, stupidly, we, would, never, have, been, caught, is, almost, entirely, due, to, subsequent, developments, although, paralleled, in, many, of, the, other, germanic, languages, among, the, primary, innovations, in, proto, germanic, are, the, preterite, present, verbs, a, special, set, of, verbs, whose, present, tense, looks, like, the, past, tense, of, other, verbs, and, which, is, the, origin, of, most, modal, verbs, in, english, a, past, tense, ending, in, the, so, called, weak, verbs, marked, with, ed, in, english, that, appears, variously, as, d, or, t, often, assumed, to, be, derived, from, the, verb, to, do, and, two, separate, sets, of, adjective, endings, originally, corresponding, to, a, distinction, between, indefinite, semantics, a, man, with, a, combination, of, pie, adjective, and, pronoun, endings, and, definite, semantics, the, man, with, endings, derived, from, pie, n, stem, nouns, note, that, most, modern, germanic, languages, have, lost, most, of, the, inherited, inflectional, morphology, as, a, result, of, the, steady, attrition, of, unstressed, endings, triggered, by, the, strong, initial, stress, contrast, for, example, the, balto, slavic, languages, which, have, largely, kept, the, indo, european, pitch, accent, and, consequently, preserved, much, of, the, inherited, morphology, icelandic, and, to, a, lesser, extent, modern, german, best, preserve, the, proto, germanic, inflectional, system, with, four, noun, cases, three, genders, and, well, marked, verbs, english, and, afrikaans, are, at, the, other, extreme, with, almost, no, remaining, inflectional, morphology, the, following, shows, a, typical, masculine, a, stem, noun, proto, germanic, fiskaz, fish, and, its, development, in, the, various, old, literary, languages, originally, adjectives, in, proto, indo, european, followed, the, same, declensional, classes, as, nouns, the, most, common, class, the, o, class, used, a, combination, of, o, stem, endings, for, masculine, and, neuter, genders, and, stems, ending, for, feminine, genders, but, other, common, classes, e, g, the, i, class, and, u, class, used, endings, from, a, single, vowel, stem, declension, for, all, genders, and, various, other, classes, existed, that, were, based, on, other, declensions, a, quite, different, set, of, pronominal, endings, was, used, for, pronouns, determiners, and, words, with, related, semantics, e, g, all, only, an, important, innovation, in, proto, germanic, was, the, development, of, two, separate, sets, of, adjective, endings, originally, corresponding, to, a, distinction, between, indefinite, semantics, a, man, and, definite, semantics, the, man, the, endings, of, indefinite, adjectives, were, derived, from, a, combination, of, pronominal, endings, with, one, of, the, common, vowel, stem, adjective, declensions, usually, the, o, class, often, termed, the, a, class, in, the, specific, context, of, the, germanic, languages, but, sometimes, the, i, or, u, classes, definite, adjectives, however, had, endings, based, on, n, stem, nouns, originally, both, types, of, adjectives, could, be, used, by, themselves, but, already, by, proto, germanic, times, a, pattern, evolved, whereby, definite, adjectives, had, to, be, accompanied, by, a, determiner, with, definite, semantics, e, g, a, definite, article, demonstrative, pronoun, possessive, pronoun, or, the, like, while, indefinite, adjectives, were, used, in, other, circumstances, either, accompanied, by, a, word, with, indefinite, semantics, such, as, a, one, or, some, or, unaccompanied, in, the, 19th, century, the, two, types, of, adjectives, indefinite, and, definite, were, respectively, termed, strong, and, weak, names, which, are, still, commonly, used, these, names, were, based, on, the, appearance, of, the, two, sets, of, endings, in, modern, german, in, german, the, distinctive, case, endings, formerly, present, on, nouns, have, largely, disappeared, with, the, result, that, the, load, of, distinguishing, one, case, from, another, is, almost, entirely, carried, by, determiners, and, adjectives, furthermore, due, to, regular, sound, change, the, various, definite, n, stem, adjective, endings, coalesced, to, the, point, where, only, two, endings, e, and, en, remain, in, modern, german, to, express, the, sixteen, possible, inflectional, categories, of, the, language, masculine, feminine, neuter, plural, crossed, with, nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, modern, german, merges, all, genders, in, the, plural, the, indefinite, a, stem, adjective, endings, were, less, affected, by, sound, change, with, six, endings, remaining, e, es, er, em, en, cleverly, distributed, in, a, way, that, is, capable, of, expressing, the, various, inflectional, categories, without, too, much, ambiguity, as, a, result, the, definite, endings, were, thought, of, as, too, weak, to, carry, inflectional, meaning, and, in, need, of, strengthening, by, the, presence, of, an, accompanying, determiner, while, the, indefinite, endings, were, viewed, as, strong, enough, to, indicate, the, inflectional, categories, even, when, standing, alone, this, view, is, enhanced, by, the, fact, that, modern, german, largely, uses, weak, ending, adjectives, when, accompanying, an, indefinite, article, and, hence, the, indefinite, definite, distinction, no, longer, clearly, applies, by, analogy, the, terms, strong, and, weak, were, extended, to, the, corresponding, noun, classes, with, a, stem, and, stem, nouns, termed, strong, and, n, stem, nouns, termed, weak, however, in, proto, germanic, and, still, in, gothic, the, most, conservative, germanic, language, the, terms, strong, and, weak, are, not, clearly, appropriate, for, one, thing, there, were, a, large, number, of, noun, declensions, the, a, stem, stem, and, n, stem, declensions, were, the, most, common, and, represented, targets, into, which, the, other, declensions, were, eventually, absorbed, but, this, process, occurred, only, gradually, originally, the, n, stem, declension, was, not, a, single, declension, but, a, set, of, separate, declensions, e, g, an, n, n, with, related, endings, and, these, endings, were, in, no, way, any, weaker, than, the, endings, of, any, other, declensions, for, example, among, the, eight, possible, inflectional, categories, of, a, noun, singular, plural, crossed, with, nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, masculine, an, stem, nouns, in, gothic, include, seven, endings, and, feminine, n, stem, nouns, include, six, endings, meaning, there, is, very, little, ambiguity, of, weakness, in, these, endings, and, in, fact, much, less, than, in, the, german, strong, endings, although, it, is, possible, to, group, the, various, noun, declensions, into, three, basic, categories, vowel, stem, n, stem, and, other, consonant, stem, a, k, a, minor, declensions, the, vowel, stem, nouns, do, not, display, any, sort, of, unity, in, their, endings, that, supports, grouping, them, together, with, each, other, but, separate, from, the, n, stem, endings, it, is, only, in, later, languages, that, the, binary, distinction, between, strong, and, weak, nouns, become, more, relevant, in, old, english, the, n, stem, nouns, form, a, single, clear, class, but, the, masculine, a, stem, and, feminine, stem, nouns, have, little, in, common, with, each, other, and, neither, has, much, similarity, to, the, small, class, of, u, stem, nouns, similarly, in, old, norse, the, masculine, a, stem, and, feminine, stem, nouns, have, little, in, common, with, each, other, and, the, continuations, of, the, masculine, an, stem, and, feminine, n, n, stem, nouns, are, also, quite, distinct, it, is, only, in, middle, dutch, and, modern, german, that, the, various, vowel, stem, nouns, have, merged, to, the, point, that, a, binary, strong, weak, distinction, clearly, applies, as, a, result, newer, grammatical, descriptions, of, the, germanic, languages, often, avoid, the, terms, strong, and, weak, except, in, conjunction, with, german, itself, preferring, instead, to, use, the, terms, indefinite, and, definite, for, adjectives, and, to, distinguish, nouns, by, their, actual, stem, class, in, english, both, sets, of, adjective, endings, were, lost, entirely, in, the, late, middle, english, period,

more, separated, ones, not, within, the, germanic, language, family, are, east, germanic, west, germanic, and, north, germanic, however, east, germanic, languages, became, extinct, several, centuries,

anglo, frisian, on, one, hand, and, continental, west, germanic, on, the, other, anglo, frisian, notably, includes, english, and, all, its, variants, while, continental, west, germanic, includes, german, standard, register, and, dialects, as, well, as, dutch, standard, register, and, dialects, east, germanic, includes, most, notably, the, extinct, gothic, and, crimean, gothic, languages,
