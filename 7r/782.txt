a, social, norm, is, a, shared, standard, of, acceptable, behavior, by, a, group, social, norms, can, both, be, informal, understandings, that, govern, the, behavior, of, members, of, a, society, as, well, as, be, codified, into, rules, and, laws, social, normative, influences, or, social, norms, are, deemed, to, be, powerful, drivers, of, human, behavioural, changes, and, well, organized, and, incorporated, by, major, theories, which, explain, human, behaviour, institutions, are, composed, of, multiple, norms, norms, are, shared, social, beliefs, about, behavior, thus, they, are, distinct, from, ideas, attitudes, and, values, which, can, be, held, privately, and, which, do, not, necessarily, concern, behavior, norms, are, contingent, on, context, social, group, and, historical, circumstances, scholars, distinguish, between, regulative, norms, which, constrain, behavior, constitutive, norms, which, shape, interests, and, prescriptive, norms, which, prescribe, what, actors, ought, to, do, the, effects, of, norms, can, be, determined, by, a, logic, of, appropriateness, and, logic, of, consequences, the, former, entails, that, actors, follow, norms, because, it, is, socially, appropriate, and, the, latter, entails, that, actors, follow, norms, because, of, cost, benefit, calculations, three, stages, have, been, identified, in, the, life, cycle, of, a, norm, 1, norm, emergence, norm, entrepreneurs, seek, to, persuade, others, of, the, desirability, and, appropriateness, of, certain, behaviors, 2, norm, cascade, when, a, norm, obtains, broad, acceptance, and, 3, norm, internalization, when, a, norm, acquires, a, taken, for, granted, quality, norms, are, robust, to, various, degrees, some, norms, are, often, violated, whereas, other, norms, are, so, deeply, internalized, that, norm, violations, are, infrequent, evidence, for, the, existence, of, norms, can, be, detected, in, the, patterns, of, behavior, within, groups, as, well, as, the, articulation, of, norms, in, group, discourse, there, are, varied, definitions, of, social, norms, but, there, is, agreement, among, scholars, that, norms, are, in, 1965, jack, p, gibbs, identified, three, basic, normative, dimensions, that, all, concepts, of, norms, could, be, subsumed, under, according, to, ronald, jepperson, peter, katzenstein, and, alexander, wendt, norms, are, collective, expectations, about, proper, behavior, for, a, given, identity, wayne, sandholtz, argues, against, this, definition, as, he, writes, that, shared, expectations, are, an, effect, of, norms, not, an, intrinsic, quality, of, norms, sandholtz, martha, finnemore, and, kathryn, sikkink, define, norms, instead, as, standards, of, appropriate, behavior, for, actors, with, a, given, identity, in, this, definition, norms, have, an, oughtness, quality, to, them, michael, hechter, and, karl, dieter, opp, define, norms, as, cultural, phenomena, that, prescribe, and, proscribe, behavior, in, specific, circumstances, sociologists, christine, horne, and, stefanie, mollborn, define, norms, as, group, level, evaluations, of, behavior, this, entails, that, norms, are, widespread, expectations, of, social, approval, or, disapproval, of, behavior, scholars, debate, whether, social, norms, are, individual, constructs, or, collective, constructs, economist, and, game, theorist, peyton, young, defines, norms, as, patterns, of, behavior, that, are, self, enforcing, within, a, group, he, emphasizes, that, norms, are, driven, by, shared, expectations, everyone, conforms, everyone, is, expected, to, conform, and, everyone, wants, to, conform, when, they, expect, everyone, else, to, conform, he, characterizes, norms, as, devices, that, coordinate, people, s, expectations, in, interactions, that, possess, multiple, equilibria, concepts, such, as, conventions, customs, morals, mores, rules, and, laws, have, been, characterized, as, equivalent, to, norms, institutions, can, be, considered, collections, or, clusters, of, multiple, norms, rules, and, norms, are, not, necessarily, distinct, phenomena, both, are, standards, of, conduct, that, can, have, varying, levels, of, specificity, and, formality, laws, are, a, highly, formal, version, of, norms, laws, rules, and, norms, may, be, at, odds, for, example, a, law, may, prohibit, something, but, norms, still, allow, it, norms, are, not, the, equivalent, of, an, aggregation, of, individual, attitudes, ideas, attitudes, and, values, are, not, necessarily, norms, as, these, concepts, do, not, necessarily, concern, behavior, and, may, be, held, privately, prevalent, behaviors, and, behavioral, regularities, are, not, necessarily, norms, instinctual, or, biological, reactions, personal, tastes, and, personal, habits, are, not, necessarily, norms, groups, may, adopt, norms, in, a, variety, of, ways, some, stable, and, self, reinforcing, norms, may, emerge, spontaneously, without, conscious, human, design, peyton, young, goes, as, far, as, to, say, that, norms, typically, evolve, without, top, down, direction, through, interactions, of, individuals, rather, than, by, design, norms, may, develop, informally, emerging, gradually, as, a, result, of, repeated, use, of, discretionary, stimuli, to, control, behavior, not, necessarily, laws, set, in, writing, informal, norms, represent, generally, accepted, and, widely, sanctioned, routines, that, people, follow, in, everyday, life, these, informal, norms, if, broken, may, not, invite, formal, legal, punishments, or, sanctions, but, instead, encourage, reprimands, warnings, or, othering, incest, for, example, is, generally, thought, of, as, wrong, in, society, but, many, jurisdictions, do, not, legally, prohibit, it, norms, may, also, be, created, and, advanced, through, conscious, human, design, by, norm, entrepreneurs, norms, can, arise, formally, where, groups, explicitly, outline, and, implement, behavioral, expectations, legal, norms, typically, arise, from, design, a, large, number, of, these, norms, we, follow, naturally, such, as, driving, on, the, right, side, of, the, road, in, the, us, and, on, the, left, side, in, the, uk, or, not, speeding, in, order, to, avoid, a, ticket, martha, finnemore, and, kathryn, sikkink, identify, three, stages, in, the, life, cycle, of, a, norm, they, argue, that, several, factors, may, raise, the, influence, of, certain, norms, christina, horne, and, stefanie, mollborn, have, identified, two, broad, categories, of, arguments, for, the, emergence, of, norms, per, consequentialism, norms, contribute, to, the, collective, good, however, per, relationalism, norms, do, not, necessarily, contribute, to, the, collective, good, norms, may, even, be, harmful, to, the, collective, some, scholars, have, characterized, norms, as, essentially, unstable, thus, creating, possibilities, for, norm, change, according, to, wayne, sandholtz, actors, are, more, likely, to, persuade, others, to, modify, existing, norms, if, they, possess, power, can, reference, existing, foundational, meta, norms, and, can, reference, precedents, social, closeness, between, actors, has, been, characterized, as, a, key, component, in, sustaining, social, norms, individuals, may, also, import, norms, from, a, previous, organization, to, their, new, group, which, can, get, adopted, over, time, without, a, clear, indication, of, how, to, act, people, typically, rely, on, their, history, to, determine, the, best, course, forward, what, was, successful, before, may, serve, them, well, again, in, a, group, individuals, may, all, import, different, histories, or, scripts, about, appropriate, behaviors, common, experience, over, time, will, lead, the, group, to, define, as, a, whole, its, take, on, the, right, action, usually, with, the, integration, of, several, members, schemas, under, the, importation, paradigm, norm, formation, occurs, subtly, and, swiftly, whereas, with, formal, or, informal, development, of, norms, may, take, longer, groups, internalize, norms, by, accepting, them, as, reasonable, and, proper, standards, for, behavior, within, the, group, once, firmly, established, a, norm, becomes, a, part, of, the, group, s, operational, structure, and, hence, more, difficult, to, change, while, possible, for, newcomers, to, a, group, to, change, its, norms, it, is, much, more, likely, that, the, new, individual, will, adopt, the, group, s, norms, values, and, perspectives, rather, than, the, other, way, around, deviance, is, defined, as, nonconformity, to, a, set, of, norms, that, are, accepted, by, a, significant, number, of, people, in, a, community, or, society, more, simply, put, if, group, members, do, not, follow, a, norm, they, become, tagged, as, a, deviant, in, the, sociological, literature, this, can, often, lead, to, them, being, considered, outcasts, of, society, yet, deviant, behavior, amongst, children, is, somewhat, expected, except, the, idea, of, this, deviance, manifesting, as, a, criminal, action, the, social, tolerance, given, in, the, example, of, the, child, is, quickly, withdrawn, against, the, criminal, crime, is, considered, one, of, the, most, extreme, forms, of, deviancy, according, to, scholar, clifford, r, shaw, what, is, considered, normal, is, relative, to, the, location, of, the, culture, in, which, the, social, interaction, is, taking, place, in, psychology, an, individual, who, routinely, disobeys, group, norms, runs, the, risk, of, turning, into, the, institutionalized, deviant, similar, to, the, sociological, definition, institutionalized, deviants, may, be, judged, by, other, group, members, for, their, failure, to, adhere, to, norms, at, first, group, members, may, increase, pressure, on, a, non, conformist, attempting, to, engage, the, individual, in, conversation, or, explicate, why, he, or, she, should, follow, their, behavioral, expectations, the, role, in, which, one, decides, on, whether, or, not, to, behave, is, largely, determined, on, how, their, actions, will, affect, others, especially, with, new, members, who, perhaps, do, not, know, any, better, groups, may, use, discretionary, stimuli, to, bring, an, individual, s, behavior, back, into, line, over, time, however, if, members, continue, to, disobey, the, group, will, give, up, on, them, as, a, lost, cause, while, the, group, may, not, necessarily, revoke, their, membership, they, may, give, them, only, superficial, consideration, if, a, worker, is, late, to, a, meeting, for, example, violating, the, office, norm, of, punctuality, a, supervisor, or, other, co, worker, may, wait, for, the, individual, to, arrive, and, pull, him, aside, later, to, ask, what, happened, if, the, behavior, continues, eventually, the, group, may, begin, meetings, without, him, since, the, individual, is, always, late, the, group, generalizes, the, individual, s, disobedience, and, promptly, dismisses, it, thereby, reducing, the, member, s, influence, and, footing, in, future, group, disagreements, group, tolerance, for, deviation, varies, across, membership, not, all, group, members, receive, the, same, treatment, for, norm, violations, individuals, may, build, up, a, reserve, of, good, behavior, through, conformity, which, they, can, borrow, against, later, these, idiosyncrasy, credits, provide, a, theoretical, currency, for, understanding, variations, in, group, behavioral, expectations, a, teacher, for, example, may, more, easily, forgive, a, straight, a, student, for, misbehaving, who, has, past, good, credit, saved, up, than, a, repeatedly, disruptive, student, while, past, performance, can, help, build, idiosyncrasy, credits, some, group, members, have, a, higher, balance, to, start, with, individuals, can, import, idiosyncrasy, credits, from, another, group, childhood, movie, stars, for, example, who, enroll, in, college, may, experience, more, leeway, in, adopting, school, norms, than, other, incoming, freshmen, finally, leaders, or, individuals, in, other, high, status, positions, may, begin, with, more, credits, and, appear, to, be, above, the, rules, at, times, even, their, idiosyncrasy, credits, are, not, bottomless, however, while, held, to, a, more, lenient, standard, than, the, average, member, leaders, may, still, face, group, rejection, if, their, disobedience, becomes, too, extreme, deviance, also, causes, multiple, emotions, one, experiences, when, going, against, a, norm, one, of, those, emotions, widely, attributed, to, deviance, is, guilt, guilt, is, connected, to, the, ethics, of, duty, which, in, turn, becomes, a, primary, object, of, moral, obligation, guilt, is, followed, by, an, action, that, is, questioned, after, its, doing, it, can, be, described, as, something, negative, to, the, self, as, well, as, a, negative, state, of, feeling, used, in, both, instances, it, is, both, an, unpleasant, feeling, as, well, as, a, form, of, self, punishment, using, the, metaphor, of, dirty, hands, it, is, the, staining, or, tainting, of, oneself, and, therefore, having, to, self, cleanse, away, the, filth, it, is, a, form, of, reparation, that, confronts, oneself, as, well, as, submitting, to, the, possibility, of, anger, and, punishment, from, others, guilt, is, a, point, in, both, action, and, feeling, that, acts, as, a, stimulus, for, further, honorable, actions, a, 2023, study, found, that, non, industrial, societies, varied, in, their, punishments, of, norm, violations, punishment, varied, based, on, the, types, of, norm, violations, and, the, socio, economic, system, of, the, society, the, study, found, evidence, that, reputational, punishment, was, associated, with, egalitarianism, and, the, absence, of, food, storage, material, punishment, was, associated, with, the, presence, of, food, storage, physical, punishment, was, moderately, associated, with, greater, dependence, on, hunting, and, execution, punishment, was, moderately, associated, with, social, stratification, whereas, ideas, in, general, do, not, necessarily, have, behavioral, implications, martha, finnemore, notes, that, norms, by, definition, concern, behavior, one, could, say, that, they, are, collectively, held, ideas, about, behavior, norms, running, counter, to, the, behaviors, of, the, overarching, society, or, culture, may, be, transmitted, and, maintained, within, small, subgroups, of, society, for, example, crandall, 1988, noted, that, certain, groups, e, g, cheerleading, squads, dance, troupes, sports, teams, sororities, have, a, rate, of, bulimia, a, publicly, recognized, life, threatening, disease, that, is, much, higher, than, society, as, a, whole, social, norms, have, a, way, of, maintaining, order, and, organizing, groups, in, the, field, of, social, psychology, the, roles, of, norms, are, emphasized, which, can, guide, behavior, in, a, certain, situation, or, environment, as, mental, representations, of, appropriate, behavior, it, has, been, shown, that, normative, messages, can, promote, pro, social, behavior, including, decreasing, alcohol, use, increasing, voter, turnout, and, reducing, energy, use, according, to, the, psychological, definition, of, social, norms, behavioral, component, norms, have, two, dimensions, how, much, a, behavior, is, exhibited, and, how, much, the, group, approves, of, that, behavior, although, not, considered, to, be, formal, laws, within, society, norms, still, work, to, promote, a, great, deal, of, social, control, they, are, statements, that, regulate, conduct, the, cultural, phenomenon, that, is, the, norm, is, the, prescriber, of, acceptable, behavior, in, specific, instances, ranging, in, variations, depending, on, culture, race, religion, and, geographical, location, it, is, the, foundation, of, the, terms, some, know, as, acceptable, as, not, to, injure, others, the, golden, rule, and, to, keep, promises, that, have, been, pledged, without, them, there, would, be, a, world, without, consensus, common, ground, or, restrictions, even, though, the, law, and, a, state, s, legislation, is, not, intended, to, control, social, norms, society, and, the, law, are, inherently, linked, and, one, dictates, the, other, this, is, why, it, has, been, said, that, the, language, used, in, some, legislation, is, controlling, and, dictating, for, what, should, or, should, not, be, accepted, for, example, the, criminalization, of, familial, sexual, relations, is, said, to, protect, those, that, are, vulnerable, however, even, consenting, adults, cannot, have, sexual, relationships, with, their, relatives, the, language, surrounding, these, laws, conveys, the, message, that, such, acts, are, supposedly, immoral, and, should, be, condemned, even, though, there, is, no, actual, victim, in, these, consenting, relationships, social, norms, can, be, enforced, formally, e, g, through, sanctions, or, informally, e, g, through, body, language, and, non, verbal, communication, cues, because, individuals, often, derive, physical, or, psychological, resources, from, group, membership, groups, are, said, to, control, discretionary, stimuli, groups, can, withhold, or, give, out, more, resources, in, response, to, members, adherence, to, group, norms, effectively, controlling, member, behavior, through, rewards, and, operant, conditioning, social, psychology, research, has, found, the, more, an, individual, values, group, controlled, resources, or, the, more, an, individual, sees, group, membership, as, central, to, his, definition, of, self, the, more, likely, he, is, to, conform, social, norms, also, allow, an, individual, to, assess, what, behaviors, the, group, deems, important, to, its, existence, or, survival, since, they, represent, a, codification, of, belief, groups, generally, do, not, punish, members, or, create, norms, over, actions, which, they, care, little, about, norms, in, every, culture, create, conformity, that, allows, for, people, to, become, socialized, to, the, culture, in, which, they, live, as, social, beings, individuals, learn, when, and, where, it, is, appropriate, to, say, certain, things, to, use, certain, words, to, discuss, certain, topics, or, wear, certain, clothes, and, when, it, is, not, thus, knowledge, about, cultural, norms, is, important, for, impressions, which, is, an, individual, s, regulation, of, their, nonverbal, behavior, one, also, comes, to, know, through, experience, what, types, of, people, he, she, can, and, cannot, discuss, certain, topics, with, or, wear, certain, types, of, dress, around, typically, this, knowledge, is, derived, through, experience, i, e, social, norms, are, learned, through, social, interaction, wearing, a, suit, to, a, job, interview, in, order, to, give, a, great, first, impression, represents, a, common, example, of, a, social, norm, in, the, white, collar, work, force, in, his, work, order, without, law, how, neighbors, settle, disputes, robert, ellickson, studies, various, interactions, between, members, of, neighbourhoods, and, communities, to, show, how, societal, norms, create, order, within, a, small, group, of, people, he, argues, that, in, a, small, community, or, neighborhood, many, rules, and, disputes, can, be, settled, without, a, central, governing, body, simply, by, the, interactions, within, these, communities, in, sociology, norms, are, seen, as, rules, that, bind, an, individual, s, actions, to, a, specific, sanction, in, one, of, two, forms, a, punishment, or, a, reward, through, regulation, of, behavior, social, norms, create, unique, patterns, that, allow, for, distinguishing, characteristics, to, be, made, between, social, systems, this, creates, a, boundary, that, allows, for, a, differentiation, between, those, that, belong, in, a, specific, social, setting, and, those, that, do, not, for, talcott, parsons, of, the, functionalist, school, norms, dictate, the, interactions, of, people, in, all, social, encounters, on, the, other, hand, karl, marx, believed, that, norms, are, used, to, promote, the, creation, of, roles, in, society, which, allows, for, people, of, different, levels, of, social, class, structure, to, be, able, to, function, properly, marx, claims, that, this, power, dynamic, creates, social, order, james, coleman, sociologist, used, both, micro, and, macro, conditions, for, his, theory, for, coleman, norms, start, out, as, goal, oriented, actions, by, actors, on, the, micro, level, if, the, benefits, do, not, outweigh, the, costs, of, the, action, for, the, actors, then, a, social, norm, would, emerge, the, norm, s, effectiveness, is, then, determined, by, its, ability, to, enforce, its, sanctions, against, those, who, would, not, contribute, to, the, optimal, social, order, heinrich, popitz, is, convinced, that, the, establishment, of, social, norms, that, make, the, future, actions, of, alter, foreseeable, for, ego, solves, the, problem, of, contingency, niklas, luhmann, in, this, way, ego, can, count, on, those, actions, as, if, they, would, already, have, been, performed, and, does, not, have, to, wait, for, their, actual, execution, social, interaction, is, thus, accelerated, important, factors, in, the, standardization, of, behavior, are, sanctions, and, social, roles, the, probability, of, these, behaviours, occurring, again, is, discussed, in, the, theories, of, b, f, skinner, who, states, that, operant, conditioning, plays, a, role, in, the, process, of, social, norm, development, operant, conditioning, is, the, process, by, which, behaviours, are, changed, as, a, function, of, their, consequences, the, probability, that, a, behaviour, will, occur, can, be, increased, or, decreased, depending, on, the, consequences, of, said, behaviour, in, the, case, of, social, deviance, an, individual, who, has, gone, against, a, norm, will, contact, the, negative, contingencies, associated, with, deviance, this, may, take, the, form, of, formal, or, informal, rebuke, social, isolation, or, censure, or, more, concrete, punishments, such, as, fines, or, imprisonment, if, one, reduces, the, deviant, behavior, after, receiving, a, negative, consequence, then, they, have, learned, via, punishment, if, they, have, engaged, in, a, behavior, consistent, with, a, social, norm, after, having, an, aversive, stimulus, reduced, then, they, have, learned, via, negative, reinforcement, reinforcement, increases, behavior, while, punishment, decreases, behavior, as, an, example, of, this, consider, a, child, who, has, painted, on, the, walls, of, her, house, if, she, has, never, done, this, before, she, may, immediately, seek, a, reaction, from, her, mother, or, father, the, form, of, reaction, taken, by, the, mother, or, father, will, affect, whether, the, behaviour, is, likely, to, occur, again, in, the, future, if, her, parent, is, positive, and, approving, of, the, behaviour, it, will, likely, reoccur, reinforcement, however, if, the, parent, offers, an, aversive, consequence, physical, punishment, time, out, anger, etc, then, the, child, is, less, likely, to, repeat, the, behaviour, in, future, punishment, skinner, also, states, that, humans, are, conditioned, from, a, very, young, age, on, how, to, behave, and, how, to, act, with, those, around, us, considering, the, outside, influences, of, the, society, and, location, one, is, in, built, to, blend, into, the, ambiance, and, attitude, around, us, deviance, is, a, frowned, upon, action, cialdini, reno, and, kallgren, developed, the, focus, theory, of, normative, conduct, to, describe, how, individuals, implicitly, juggle, multiple, behavioral, expectations, at, once, expanding, on, conflicting, prior, beliefs, about, whether, cultural, situational, or, personal, norms, motivate, action, the, researchers, suggested, the, focus, of, an, individual, s, attention, will, dictate, what, behavioral, expectation, they, follow, there, is, no, clear, consensus, on, how, the, term, norm, should, be, used, martha, finnemore, and, kathryn, sikkink, distinguish, between, three, types, of, norms, finnemore, sikkink, jeffrey, w, legro, and, others, have, argued, that, the, robustness, or, effectiveness, of, norms, can, be, measured, by, factors, such, as, christina, horne, argues, that, the, robustness, of, a, norm, is, shaped, by, the, degree, of, support, for, the, actors, who, sanction, deviant, behaviors, she, refers, to, norms, regulating, how, to, enforce, norms, as, metanorms, according, to, beth, g, simmons, and, hyeran, jo, diversity, of, support, for, a, norm, can, be, a, strong, indicator, of, robustness, they, add, that, institutionalization, of, a, norm, raises, its, robustness, it, has, also, been, posited, that, norms, that, exist, within, broader, clusters, of, distinct, but, mutually, reinforcing, norms, may, be, more, robust, jeffrey, checkel, argues, that, there, are, two, common, types, of, explanations, for, the, efficacy, of, norms, according, to, peyton, young, mechanisms, that, support, normative, behavior, include, descriptive, norms, depict, what, happens, while, injunctive, norms, describe, what, should, happen, cialdini, reno, and, kallgren, 1990, define, a, descriptive, norm, as, people, s, perceptions, of, what, is, commonly, done, in, specific, situations, it, signifies, what, most, people, do, without, assigning, judgment, the, absence, of, trash, on, the, ground, in, a, parking, lot, for, example, transmits, the, descriptive, norm, that, most, people, there, do, not, litter, an, injunctive, norm, on, the, other, hand, transmits, group, approval, about, a, particular, behavior, it, dictates, how, an, individual, should, behave, watching, another, person, pick, up, trash, off, the, ground, and, throw, it, out, a, group, member, may, pick, up, on, the, injunctive, norm, that, he, ought, to, not, litter, prescriptive, norms, are, unwritten, rules, that, are, understood, and, followed, by, society, and, indicate, what, we, should, do, expressing, gratitude, or, writing, a, thank, you, card, when, someone, gives, you, a, gift, represents, a, prescriptive, norm, in, american, culture, proscriptive, norms, in, contrast, comprise, the, other, end, of, the, same, spectrum, they, are, similarly, society, s, unwritten, rules, about, what, one, should, not, do, these, norms, can, vary, between, cultures, while, kissing, someone, you, just, met, on, the, cheek, is, an, acceptable, greeting, in, some, european, countries, this, is, not, acceptable, and, thus, represents, a, proscriptive, norm, in, the, united, states, subjective, norms, are, determined, by, beliefs, about, the, extent, to, which, important, others, want, a, person, to, perform, a, behavior, when, combined, with, attitude, toward, behavior, subjective, norms, shape, an, individual, s, intentions, social, influences, are, conceptualized, in, terms, of, the, pressure, that, people, perceive, from, important, others, to, perform, or, not, to, perform, a, behavior, social, psychologist, icek, azjen, theorized, that, subjective, norms, are, determined, by, the, strength, of, a, given, normative, belief, and, further, weighted, by, the, significance, of, a, social, referent, as, represented, in, the, following, equation, sn, n, i, m, i, where, n, is, a, normative, belief, and, m, is, the, motivation, to, comply, with, said, belief, over, the, last, few, decades, several, theorists, have, attempted, to, explain, social, norms, from, a, more, theoretical, point, of, view, by, quantifying, behavioral, expectations, graphically, or, attempting, to, plot, the, logic, behind, adherence, theorists, hoped, to, be, able, to, predict, whether, or, not, individuals, would, conform, the, return, potential, model, and, game, theory, provide, a, slightly, more, economic, conceptualization, of, norms, suggesting, individuals, can, calculate, the, cost, or, benefit, behind, possible, behavioral, outcomes, under, these, theoretical, frameworks, choosing, to, obey, or, violate, norms, becomes, a, more, deliberate, quantifiable, decision, developed, in, the, 1960s, the, return, potential, model, provides, a, method, for, plotting, and, visualizing, group, norms, in, the, regular, coordinate, plane, the, amount, of, behavior, exhibited, is, plotted, on, the, x, axis, label, a, in, figure, 1, while, the, amount, of, group, acceptance, or, approval, gets, plotted, on, the, y, axis, b, in, figure, 1, the, graph, represents, the, potential, return, or, positive, outcome, to, an, individual, for, a, given, behavioral, norm, theoretically, one, could, plot, a, point, for, each, increment, of, behavior, how, much, the, group, likes, or, dislikes, that, action, for, example, it, may, be, the, case, that, among, first, year, graduate, students, strong, social, norms, exist, around, how, many, daily, cups, of, coffee, a, student, drinks, if, the, return, curve, in, figure, 1, correctly, displays, the, example, social, norm, we, can, see, that, if, someone, drinks, 0, cups, of, coffee, a, day, the, group, strongly, disapproves, the, group, disapproves, of, the, behavior, of, any, member, who, drinks, fewer, than, four, cups, of, coffee, a, day, the, group, disapproves, of, drinking, more, than, seven, cups, shown, by, the, approval, curve, dipping, back, below, zero, as, seen, in, this, example, the, return, potential, model, displays, how, much, group, approval, one, can, expect, for, each, increment, of, behavior, another, general, formal, framework, that, can, be, used, to, represent, the, essential, elements, of, the, social, situation, surrounding, a, norm, is, the, repeated, game, of, game, theory, rational, choice, a, branch, of, game, theory, deals, with, the, relations, and, actions, socially, committed, among, rational, agents, a, norm, gives, a, person, a, rule, of, thumb, for, how, they, should, behave, however, a, rational, person, acts, according, to, the, rule, only, if, it, is, beneficial, for, them, the, situation, can, be, described, as, follows, a, norm, gives, an, expectation, of, how, other, people, act, in, a, given, situation, macro, a, person, acts, optimally, given, the, expectation, micro, for, a, norm, to, be, stable, people, s, actions, must, reconstitute, the, expectation, without, change, micro, macro, feedback, loop, a, set, of, such, correct, stable, expectations, is, known, as, a, nash, equilibrium, thus, a, stable, norm, must, constitute, a, nash, equilibrium, in, the, nash, equilibrium, no, one, actor, has, any, positive, incentive, in, individually, deviating, from, a, certain, action, social, norms, will, be, implemented, if, the, actions, of, that, specific, norm, come, into, agreement, by, the, support, of, the, nash, equilibrium, in, the, majority, of, the, game, theoretical, approaches, from, a, game, theoretical, point, of, view, there, are, two, explanations, for, the, vast, variety, of, norms, that, exist, throughout, the, world, one, is, the, difference, in, games, different, parts, of, the, world, may, give, different, environmental, contexts, and, different, people, may, have, different, values, which, may, result, in, a, difference, in, games, the, other, is, equilibrium, selection, not, explicable, by, the, game, itself, equilibrium, selection, is, closely, related, to, coordination, for, a, simple, example, driving, is, common, throughout, the, world, but, in, some, countries, people, drive, on, the, right, and, in, other, countries, people, drive, on, the, left, see, coordination, game, a, framework, called, comparative, institutional, analysis, is, proposed, to, deal, with, the, game, theoretical, structural, understanding, of, the, variety, of, social, norms
