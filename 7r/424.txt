gernot, windfuhr, considers, new, persian, as, an, evolution, of, the, old, persian, language, and, the, middle, persian, language, but, also, states, that, none, of, the, known, middle, persian, dialects, is, the, direct, predecessor, of, modern, persian, ludwig, paul, states, the, language, of, the, shahnameh, should, be, seen, as, one, instance, of, continuous, historical, development, from, middle, to, new, persian, the, known, history, of, the, persian, language, can, be, divided, into, the, following, three, distinct, periods, as, a, written, language, old, persian, is, attested, in, royal, achaemenid, inscriptions, the, oldest, known, text, written, in, old, persian, is, from, the, behistun, inscription, dating, to, the, time, of, king, darius, i, reigned, 522, 486, bc, examples, of, old, persian, have, been, found, in, what, is, now, iran, romania, gherla, armenia, bahrain, iraq, turkey, and, egypt, old, persian, is, one, of, the, earliest, attested, indo, european, languages, according, to, certain, historical, assumptions, about, the, early, history, and, origin, of, ancient, persians, in, southwestern, iran, where, achaemenids, hailed, from, old, persian, was, originally, spoken, by, a, tribe, called, parsuwash, who, arrived, in, the, iranian, plateau, early, in, the, 1st, millennium, bce, and, finally, migrated, down, into, the, area, of, present, day, f, rs, province, their, language, old, persian, became, the, official, language, of, the, achaemenid, kings, assyrian, records, which, in, fact, appear, to, provide, the, earliest, evidence, for, ancient, iranian, persian, and, median, presence, on, the, iranian, plateau, give, a, good, chronology, but, only, an, approximate, geographical, indication, of, what, seem, to, be, ancient, persians, in, these, records, of, the, 9th, century, bce, parsuwash, along, with, matai, presumably, medians, are, first, mentioned, in, the, area, of, lake, urmia, in, the, records, of, shalmaneser, iii, the, exact, identity, of, the, parsuwash, is, not, known, for, certain, but, from, a, linguistic, viewpoint, the, word, matches, old, persian, p, rsa, itself, coming, directly, from, the, older, word, p, r, wa, also, as, old, persian, contains, many, words, from, another, extinct, iranian, language, median, according, to, p, o, skj, rv, it, is, probable, that, old, persian, had, already, been, spoken, before, the, formation, of, the, achaemenid, empire, and, was, spoken, during, most, of, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, bce, xenophon, a, greek, general, serving, in, some, of, the, persian, expeditions, describes, many, aspects, of, armenian, village, life, and, hospitality, in, around, 401, bce, which, is, when, old, persian, was, still, spoken, and, extensively, used, he, relates, that, the, armenian, people, spoke, a, language, that, to, his, ear, sounded, like, the, language, of, the, persians, related, to, old, persian, but, from, a, different, branch, of, the, iranian, language, family, was, avestan, the, language, of, the, zoroastrian, liturgical, texts, the, complex, grammatical, conjugation, and, declension, of, old, persian, yielded, to, the, structure, of, middle, persian, in, which, the, dual, number, disappeared, leaving, only, singular, and, plural, as, did, gender, middle, persian, developed, the, ez, fe, construction, expressed, through, modern, e, ye, to, indicate, some, of, the, relations, between, words, that, have, been, lost, with, the, simplification, of, the, earlier, grammatical, system, although, the, middle, period, of, the, iranian, languages, formally, begins, with, the, fall, of, the, achaemenid, empire, the, transition, from, old, to, middle, persian, had, probably, already, begun, before, the, 4th, century, bc, however, middle, persian, is, not, actually, attested, until, 600, years, later, when, it, appears, in, the, sassanid, era, 224, 651, ad, inscriptions, so, any, form, of, the, language, before, this, date, cannot, be, described, with, any, degree, of, certainty, moreover, as, a, literary, language, middle, persian, is, not, attested, until, much, later, in, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, from, the, 8th, century, onward, middle, persian, gradually, began, yielding, to, new, persian, with, the, middle, period, form, only, continuing, in, the, texts, of, zoroastrianism, middle, persian, is, considered, to, be, a, later, form, of, the, same, dialect, as, old, persian, the, native, name, of, middle, persian, was, parsig, or, parsik, after, the, name, of, the, ethnic, group, of, the, southwest, that, is, of, pars, old, persian, parsa, new, persian, fars, this, is, the, origin, of, the, name, farsi, as, it, is, today, used, to, signify, new, persian, following, the, collapse, of, the, sassanid, state, parsik, came, to, be, applied, exclusively, to, either, middle, or, new, persian, that, was, written, in, the, arabic, script, from, about, the, 9th, century, onward, as, middle, persian, was, on, the, threshold, of, becoming, new, persian, the, older, form, of, the, language, came, to, be, erroneously, called, pahlavi, which, was, actually, but, one, of, the, writing, systems, used, to, render, both, middle, persian, as, well, as, various, other, middle, iranian, languages, that, writing, system, had, previously, been, adopted, by, the, sassanids, who, were, persians, i, e, from, the, southwest, from, the, preceding, arsacids, who, were, parthians, i, e, from, the, northeast, while, ibn, al, muqaffa, eighth, century, still, distinguished, between, pahlavi, i, e, parthian, and, persian, in, arabic, text, al, farisiyah, i, e, middle, persian, this, distinction, is, not, evident, in, arab, commentaries, written, after, that, date, new, persian, also, referred, to, as, modern, persian, is, conventionally, divided, into, three, stages, early, new, persian, remains, largely, intelligible, to, speakers, of, contemporary, persian, as, the, morphology, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, lexicon, of, the, language, have, remained, relatively, stable, new, persian, texts, written, in, the, arabic, script, first, appear, in, the, 9th, century, the, language, is, a, direct, descendant, of, middle, persian, the, official, religious, and, literary, language, of, the, sasanian, empire, 224, 651, however, it, is, not, descended, from, the, literary, form, of, middle, persian, known, as, p, rs, k, commonly, called, pahlavi, which, was, spoken, by, the, people, of, fars, and, used, in, zoroastrian, religious, writings, instead, it, is, descended, from, the, dialect, spoken, by, the, court, of, the, sasanian, capital, ctesiphon, and, the, northeastern, iranian, region, of, khorasan, known, as, dari, the, region, which, comprised, the, present, territories, of, northwestern, afghanistan, as, well, as, parts, of, central, asia, played, a, leading, role, in, the, rise, of, new, persian, khorasan, which, was, the, homeland, of, the, parthians, was, persianized, under, the, sasanians, dari, persian, thus, supplanted, parthian, language, which, by, the, end, of, the, sasanian, era, had, fallen, out, of, use, new, persian, has, incorporated, many, foreign, words, including, from, eastern, northern, and, northern, iranian, languages, such, as, sogdian, and, especially, parthian, the, transition, to, new, persian, was, already, complete, by, the, era, of, the, three, princely, dynasties, of, iranian, origin, the, tahirid, dynasty, 820, 872, saffarid, dynasty, 860, 903, and, samanid, empire, 874, 999, abbas, of, merv, is, mentioned, as, being, the, earliest, minstrel, to, chant, verse, in, the, new, persian, tongue, and, after, him, the, poems, of, hanzala, badghisi, were, among, the, most, famous, between, the, persian, speakers, of, the, time, the, first, poems, of, the, persian, language, a, language, historically, called, dari, emerged, in, present, day, afghanistan, the, first, significant, persian,

singer, has, survived, although, little, of, his, poetry, has, been, preserved, among, his, lost, works, are, versified, fables, collected, in, the, kalila, wa, dimna, the, language, spread, geographically, from, the, 11th, century, on, and, was, the, medium, through, which, among, others, central, asian, turks, became, familiar, with, islam, and, urban, culture, new, persian, was, widely, used, as, a, trans, regional, lingua, franca, a, task, aided, due, to, its, relatively, simple, morphology, and, this, situation, persisted, until, at, least, the, 19th, century, in, the, late, middle, ages, new, islamic, literary, languages, were, created, on, the, persian, model, ottoman, turkish, chagatai, turkic, dobhashi, bengali, and, urdu, which, are, regarded, as, structural,

to, 12th, centuries, which, continued, to, be, used, as, literary, language, and, lingua, franca, under, the, persianized, turko, mongol, dynasties, during, the, 12th, to, 15th, centuries, and, under, restored, persian, rule, during, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, persian, during, this, time, served, as, lingua, franca, of, greater, persia, and, of, much, of, the, indian, subcontinent, it, was,

language, especially, vocabulary, related, to, technology, the, first, official, attentions, to, the, necessity, of, protecting, the, persian, language, against, foreign, words, and, to, the, standardization, of, persian, orthography, were, under, the, reign, of, naser, ed, din, shah, of, the, qajar, dynasty, in, 1871, after, naser, ed, din, shah, mozaffar, ed, din, shah, ordered, the, establishment, of, the, first, persian, association, in, 1903, this, association, officially, declared, that, it, used, persian, and, arabic, as, acceptable, sources, for, coining, words, the, ultimate, goal, was, to, prevent, books, from, being, printed, with, wrong, use, of, words, according, to, the, executive, guarantee, of, this, association, the, government, was, responsible, for, wrongfully, printed, books, words, coined, by, this, association, such, as, r, h, han, for, railway, were, printed, in, soltani, newspaper, but, the, association, was, eventually, closed, due, to, inattention, a, scientific, association, was, founded, in, 1911, resulting, in, a, dictionary, called, words, of, scientific, association, which, was, completed, in, the, future, and, renamed, katouzian, dictionary, the, first, academy, for, the, persian, language, was, founded, on, 20, may, 1935, under, the, name, academy, of, iran, it, was, established, by, the, initiative, of, reza, shah, pahlavi, and, mainly, by, hekmat, e, shirazi, and, mohammad, ali, foroughi, all, prominent, names, in, the, nationalist, movement, of, the, time, the, academy, was, a, key, institution, in, the, struggle, to, re, build, iran, as, a, nation, state, after, the, collapse, of, the, qajar, dynasty, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, academy, led, massive, campaigns, to, replace, the, many, arabic, russian, french, and, greek, loanwords, whose, widespread, use, in, persian, during, the, centuries, preceding, the, foundation, of, the, pahlavi, dynasty, had, created, a, literary, language, considerably, different, from, the, spoken, persian, of, the, time, this, became, the, basis, of, what, is, now, known, as, contemporary, standard, persian, there, are, three, standard, varieties, of, modern, persian, all, these, three, varieties, are, based, on, the, classic, persian, literature, and, its, literary, tradition, there, are, also, several, local, dialects, from, iran, afghanistan, and, tajikistan, which, slightly, differ, from, the, standard, persian, the, hazaragi, dialect, in, central, afghanistan, and, pakistan, herati, in, western, afghanistan, darwazi, in, afghanistan, and, tajikistan, basseri, in, southern, iran, and, the, tehrani, accent, in, iran, the, basis, of, standard, iranian, persian, are, examples, of, these, dialects, persian, speaking, peoples, of, iran, afghanistan, and, tajikistan, can, understand, one, another, with, a, relatively, high, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, nevertheless, the, encyclop, dia, iranica, notes, that, the, iranian, afghan, and, tajiki, varieties, comprise, distinct, branches, of, the, persian, language, and, within, each, branch, a, wide, variety, of, local, dialects, exist, the, following, are, some, languages, closely, related, to, persian, or, in, some, cases, are, considered, dialects, more, distantly, related, branches, of, the, iranian, language, family, include, kurdish, and, balochi, the, glottolog, database, proposes, the, following, phylogenetic, classification, iranian, persian, and, tajik, have, six, vowels, dari, has, 8, iranian, persian, has, twenty, three, consonants, but, both, dari, and, tajiki, have, twenty, four, consonants, due, to, the, phonemic, merger, of, q, and, in, iranian, persian, historically, persian, distinguished, length, early, new, persian, had, a, series, of, five, long, vowels, i, u, o, and, e, along, with, three, short, vowels, i, and, u, at, some, point, prior, to, the, 16th, century, in, the, general, area, now, modern, iran, e, and, i, merged, into, i, and, o, and, u, merged, into, u, thus, older, contrasts, such, as, sh, r, lion, vs, sh, r, milk, and, z, d, quick, vs, z, r, strength, were, lost, however, there, are, exceptions, to, this, rule, and, in, some, words, and, are, merged, into, the, diphthongs, and, which, are, descendants, of, the, diphthongs, and, in, early, new, persian, instead, of, merging, into, i, and, u, examples, of, the, exception, can, be, found, in, words, such, as, bright, numerous, other, instances, exist, however, in, dari, the, archaic, distinction, of, e, and, i, respectively, known, as, y, ye, majh, l, and, y, ye, ma, r, f, is, still, preserved, as, well, as, the, distinction, of, o, and, u, known, as, w, w, e, majh, l, and, w, w, e, ma, r, f, on, the, other, hand, in, standard, tajik, the, length, distinction, has, disappeared, and, i, merged, with, i, and, u, with, u, therefore, contemporary, afghan, dari, dialects, are, the, closest, to, the, vowel, inventory, of, early, new, persian, according, to, most, studies, on, the, subject, e, g, samareh, 1977, harvnb, error, no, target, citerefsamareh1977, help, pisowicz, 1985, harvnb, error, no, target, citerefpisowicz1985, help, najafi, 2001, harvnb, error, no, target, citerefnajafi2001, help, the, three, vowels, traditionally, considered, long, i, u, are, currently, distinguished, from, their, short, counterparts, e, o, by, position, of, articulation, rather, than, by, length, however, there, are, studies, e, g, hayes, 1979, harvnb, error, no, target, citerefhayes1979, help, windfuhr, 1979, that, consider, vowel, length, to, be, the, active, feature, of, the, system, with, i, and, u, phonologically, long, or, bimoraic, and, e, and, o, phonologically, short, or, monomoraic, there, are, also, some, studies, that, consider, quality, and, quantity, to, be, both, active, in, the, iranian, system, such, as, toosarvandani, 2004, that, offers, a, synthetic, analysis, including, both, quality, and, quantity, which, often, suggests, that, modern, persian, vowels, are, in, a, transition, state, between, the, quantitative, system, of, classical, persian, and, a, hypothetical, future, iranian, language, which, will, eliminate, all, traces, of, quantity, and, retain, quality, as, the, only, active, feature, the, length, distinction, is, still, strictly, observed, by, careful, reciters, of, classic, style, poetry, for, all, varieties, including, tajik, notes, n, turns, to, in, words, that, comes, before, suffixes, predominate, persian, morphology, though, there, are, a, small, number, of, prefixes, verbs, can, express, tense, and, aspect, and, they, agree, with, the, subject, in, person, and, number, there, is, no, grammatical, gender, in, modern, persian, and, pronouns, are, not, marked, for, natural, gender, in, other, words, in, persian, pronouns, are, gender, neutral, when, referring, to, a, masculine, or, a, feminine, subject, the, same, pronoun, is, used, pronounced, ou, persian, adheres, mainly, to, subject, object, verb, sov, word, order, however, case, endings, e, g, for, subject, object, etc, expressed, via, suffixes, may, allow, users, to, vary, word, order, verbs, agree, with, the, subject, in, person, and, number, normal, declarative, sentences, are, structured, as, s, pp, o, v, sentences, have, optional, subjects, prepositional, phrases, and, objects, followed, by, a, compulsory, verb, if, the, object, is, specific, the, object, is, followed, by, the, word, r, and, precedes, prepositional, phrases, s, o, r, pp, v, persian, makes, extensive, use, of, word, building, and, combining, affixes, stems, nouns, and, adjectives, persian, frequently, uses, derivational, agglutination, to, form, new, words, from, nouns, adjectives, and, verbal, stems, new, words, are, extensively, formed, by, compounding, two, existing, words, combining, into, a, new, one, while, having, a, lesser, influence, from, arabic, and, other, languages, of, mesopotamia, and, its, core, vocabulary, being, of, middle, persian, origin, new, persian, contains, a, considerable, number, of, arabic, lexical, items, which, were, persianized, and, often, took, a, different, meaning, and, usage, than, the, arabic, original, persian, loanwords, of, arabic, origin, especially, include, islamic, terms, the, arabic, vocabulary, in, other, iranian, turkic, and, indic, languages, is, generally, understood, to, have, been, copied, from, new, persian, not, from, arabic, itself, john, r, perry, in, his, article, lexical, areas, and, semantic, fields, of, arabic, estimates, that, about, 20, percent, of, everyday, vocabulary, in, current, persian, and, around, 25, percent, of, the, vocabulary, of, classical, and, modern, persian, literature, are, of, arabic, origin, the, text, frequency, of, these, loan, words, is, generally, lower, and, varies, by, style, and, topic, area, it, may, approach, 25, percent, of, a, text, in, literature, according, to, another, source, about, 40, of, everyday, persian, literary, vocabulary, is, of, arabic, origin, among, the, arabic, loan, words, relatively, few, 14, percent, are, from, the, semantic, domain, of, material, culture, while, a, larger, number, are, from, domains, of, intellectual, and, spiritual, life, most, of, the, arabic, words, used, in, persian, are, either, synonyms, of, native, terms, or, could, be, glossed, in, persian, the, inclusion, of, mongolic, and, turkic, elements, in, the, persian, language, should, also, be, mentioned, not, only, because, of, the, political, role, a, succession, of, turkic, dynasties, played, in, iranian, history, but, also, because, of, the, immense, prestige, persian, language, and, literature, enjoyed, in, the, wider, non, arab, islamic, world, which, was, often, ruled, by, sultans, and, emirs, with, a, turkic, background, the, turkish, and, mongolian, vocabulary, in, persian, is, minor, in, comparison, to, that, of, arabic, and, these, words, were, mainly, confined, to, military, pastoral, terms, and, political, sector, titles, administration, etc, new, military, and, political, titles, were, coined, based, partially, on, middle, persian, e, g, arte, for, army, instead, of, the, uzbek, qo, shin, sarla, kar, dary, b, n, etc, in, the, 20th, century, persian, has, likewise, influenced, the, vocabularies, of, other, languages, especially, other, indo, european, languages, such, as, armenian, urdu, bengali, and, hindi, the, latter, three, through, conquests, of, persianized, central, asian, turkic, and, afghan, invaders, turkic, languages, such, as, ottoman, turkish, chagatai, tatar, turkish, turkmen, azeri, uzbek, and, karachay, balkar, caucasian, languages, such, as, georgian, and, to, a, lesser, extent, avar, and, lezgin, afro, asiatic, languages, like, assyrian, list, of, loanwords, in, assyrian, neo, aramaic, and, arabic, particularly, bahrani, arabic, and, even, dravidian, languages, indirectly, especially, malayalam, tamil, telugu, and, brahui, as, well, as, austronesian, languages, such, as, indonesian, and, malaysian, malay, persian, has, also, had, a, significant, lexical, influence, via, turkish, on, albanian, and, serbo, croatian, particularly, as, spoken, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, use, of, occasional, foreign, synonyms, instead, of, persian, words, can, be, a, common, practice, in, everyday, communications, as, an, alternative, expression, in, some, instances, in, addition, to, the, persian, vocabulary, the, equivalent, synonyms, from, multiple, foreign, languages, can, be, used, for, example, in, iranian, colloquial, persian, not, in, afghanistan, or, tajikistan, the, phrase, thank, you, may, be, expressed, using, the, french, word, merci, stressed, however, on, the, first, syllable, the, hybrid, persian, arabic, phrase, mote, akkeram, mote, akker, being, thankful, in, arabic, commonly, pronounced, mo, akker, in, persian, and, the, verb, am, meaning, i, am, in, persian, or, by, the, pure, persian, phrase, sep, s, goz, ram, the, vast, majority, of, modern, iranian, persian, and, dari, text, is, written, with, the, arabic, script, tajiki, which, is, considered, by, some, linguists, to, be, a, persian, dialect, influenced, by, russian, and, the, turkic, languages, of, central, asia, is, written, with, the, cyrillic, script, in, tajikistan, see, tajik, alphabet, there, also, exist, several, romanization, systems, for, persian, modern, iranian, persian, and, afghan, persian, are, written, using, the, persian, alphabet, which, is, a, modified, variant, of, the, arabic, alphabet, which, uses, different, pronunciation, and, additional, letters, not, found, in, arabic, language, after, the, arab, conquest, of, persia, it, took, approximately, 200, years, before, persians, adopted, the, arabic, script, in, place, of, the, older, alphabet, previously, two, different, scripts, were, used, pahlavi, used, for, middle, persian, and, the, avestan, alphabet, in, persian, d, ndapirak, or, din, dabire, literally, religion, script, used, for, religious, purposes, primarily, for, the, avestan, but, sometimes, for, middle, persian, in, the, modern, persian, script, historically, short, vowels, are, usually, not, written, only, the, historically, long, ones, are, represented, in, the, text, so, words, distinguished, from, each, other, only, by, short, vowels, are, ambiguous, in, writing, iranian, persian, kerm, worm, karam, generosity, kerem, cream, and, krom, chrome, are, all, spelled, krm, in, persian, the, reader, must, determine, the, word, from, context, the, arabic, system, of, vocalization, marks, known, as, harakat, is, also, used, in, persian, although, some, of, the, symbols, have, different, pronunciations, for, example, a, ammah, is, pronounced, while, in, iranian, persian, it, is, pronounced, this, system, is, not, used, in, mainstream, persian, literature, it, is, primarily, used, for, teaching, and, in, some, but, not, all, dictionaries, there, are, several, letters, generally, only, used, in, arabic, loanwords, these, letters, are, pronounced, the, same, as, similar, persian, letters, for, example, there, are, four, functionally, identical, letters, for, z, three, letters, for, s, two, letters, for, t, two, letters, for, h, on, the, other, hand, there, are, four, letters, that, do, not, exist, in, arabic, the, persian, alphabet, adds, four, letters, to, the, arabic, alphabet, historically, there, was, also, a, special, letter, for, the, sound, this, letter, is, no, longer, used, as, the, sound, changed, to, b, e, g, archaic, za, a, n, z, b, n, language, the, persian, alphabet, also, modifies, some, letters, of, the, arabic, alphabet, for, example, alef, with, hamza, below, changes, to, alef, words, using, various, hamzas, get, spelled, with, yet, another, kind, of, hamza, so, that, becomes, even, though, the, latter, has, been, accepted, in, arabic, since, the, 1980s, and, teh, marbuta, changes, to, heh, or, teh, the, letters, different, in, shape, are, however, in, shape, and, form, is, the, traditional, arabic, style, that, continues, in, the, nile, valley, namely, egypt, sudan, and, south, sudan, the, international, organization, for, standardization, has, published, a, standard, for, simplified, transliteration, of, persian, into, latin, iso, 233, 3, titled, information, and, documentation, transliteration, of, arabic, characters, into, latin, characters, part, 3, persian, language, simplified, transliteration, but, the, transliteration, scheme, is, not, in, widespread, use, another, latin, alphabet, based, on, the, new, turkic, alphabet, was, used, in, tajikistan, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, alphabet, was, phased, out, in, favor, of, cyrillic, in, the, late, 1930s, fingilish, is, persian, using, iso, basic, latin, alphabet, it, is, most, commonly, used, in, chat, emails, and, sms, applications, the, orthography, is, not, standardized, and, varies, among, writers, and, even, media, for, example, typing, aa, for, the, phoneme, is, easier, on, computer, keyboards, than, on, cellphone, keyboards, resulting, in, smaller, usage, of, the, combination, on, cellphones, the, cyrillic, script, was, introduced, for, writing, the, tajik, language, under, the, tajik, soviet, socialist, republic, in, the, late, 1930s, replacing, the, latin, alphabet, that, had, been, used, since, the, october, revolution, and, the, persian, script, that, had, been, used, earlier, after, 1939, materials, published, in, persian, in, the, persian, script, were, banned, in,
