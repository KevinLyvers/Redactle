a, service, is, an, act, or, use, for, which, a, consumer, company, or, government, is, willing, to, pay, examples, include, work, done, by, barbers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, banks, insurance, companies, and, so, on, public, services, are, those, that, society, nation, state, fiscal, union, or, region, as, a, whole, pays, for, using, resources, skill, ingenuity, and, experience, service, provider, s, benefit, service, consumers, services, may, be, defined, as, intangible, acts, or, performances, whereby, the, service, provider, provides, value, to, the, customer, services, have, three, key, characteristics, services, are, by, definition, intangible, they, are, not, manufactured, transported, or, stocked, one, cannot, store, services, for, future, use, they, are, produced, and, consumed, simultaneously, services, are, perishable, in, two, regards, the, service, provider, must, deliver, the, service, at, the, exact, time, of, service, consumption, the, service, is, not, manifested, in, a, physical, object, that, is, independent, of, the, provider, the, service, consumer, is, also, inseparable, from, service, delivery, examples, the, service, consumer, must, sit, in, the, hairdresser, s, chair, or, in, the, airplane, seat, correspondingly, the, hairdresser, or, the, pilot, must, be, in, the, shop, or, plane, respectively, to, deliver, the, service, each, service, is, unique, it, can, never, be, exactly, repeated, as, the, time, location, circumstances, conditions, current, configurations, and, or, assigned, resources, are, different, for, the, next, delivery, even, if, the, same, service, is, requested, by, the, consumer, many, services, are, regarded, as, heterogeneous, and, are, typically, modified, for, each, service, consumer, or, for, each, service, context, example, the, taxi, service, which, transports, the, service, consumer, from, home, to, work, is, different, from, the, taxi, service, which, transports, the, same, service, consumer, from, work, to, home, another, point, in, time, the, other, direction, possibly, another, route, probably, another, taxi, driver, and, cab, another, and, more, common, term, for, this, is, heterogeneity, mass, generation, and, delivery, of, services, must, be, mastered, for, a, service, provider, to, expand, this, can, be, seen, as, a, problem, of, service, quality, both, inputs, and, outputs, to, the, processes, involved, providing, services, are, highly, variable, as, are, the, relationships, between, these, processes, making, it, difficult, to, maintain, consistent, service, quality, many, services, involve, variable, human, activity, rather, than, a, precisely, determined, process, exceptions, include, utilities, the, human, factor, is, often, the, key, success, factor, in, service, provision, demand, can, vary, by, season, time, of, day, business, cycle, etc, consistency, is, necessary, to, create, enduring, business, relationships, any, service, can, be, clearly, and, completely, consistently, and, concisely, specified, by, means, of, standard, attributes, that, conform, to, the, mece, principle, mutually, exclusive, collectively, exhaustive, the, delivery, of, a, service, typically, involves, six, factors, the, service, encounter, is, defined, as, all, activities, involved, in, the, service, delivery, process, some, service, managers, use, the, term, moment, of, truth, to, indicate, that, point, in, a, service, encounter, where, interactions, are, most, intense, many, business, theorists, view, service, provision, as, a, performance, or, act, sometimes, humorously, referred, to, as, dramalurgy, perhaps, in, reference, to, dramaturgy, the, location, of, the, service, delivery, is, referred, to, as, the, stage, and, the, objects, that, facilitate, the, service, process, are, called, props, a, script, is, a, sequence, of, behaviors, followed, by, those, involved, including, the, client, s, some, service, dramas, are, tightly, scripted, others, are, more, ad, lib, role, congruence, occurs, when, each, actor, follows, a, script, that, harmonizes, with, the, roles, played, by, the, other, actors, in, some, service, industries, especially, health, care, dispute, resolution, and, social, services, a, popular, concept, is, the, idea, of, the, caseload, which, refers, to, the, total, number, of, patients, clients, litigants, or, claimants, for, which, a, given, employee, is, responsible, employees, must, balance, the, needs, of, each, individual, case, against, the, needs, of, all, other, current, cases, as, well, as, their, own, needs, under, english, law, if, a, service, provider, is, induced, to, deliver, services, to, a, dishonest, client, by, a, deception, this, is, an, offence, under, the, theft, act, 1978, lovelock, used, the, number, of, delivery, sites, whether, single, or, multiple, and, the, method, of, delivery, to, classify, services, in, a, 2, x, 3, matrix, then, implications, are, that, the, convenience, of, receiving, the, service, is, the, lowest, when, the, customer, has, to, come, to, the, service, and, must, use, a, single, or, specific, outlet, convenience, increases, to, a, point, as, the, number, of, service, points, increase, the, distinction, between, a, good, and, a, service, remains, disputed, the, perspective, in, the, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, centuries, focused, on, creation, and, possession, of, wealth, classical, economists, contended, that, goods, were, objects, of, value, over, which, ownership, rights, could, be, established, and, exchanged, ownership, implied, tangible, possession, of, an, object, that, had, been, acquired, through, purchase, barter, or, gift, from, the, producer, or, previous, owner, and, was, legally, identifiable, as, the, property, of, the, current, owner, adam, smith, s, famous, book, the, wealth, of, nations, published, in, 1776, distinguished, between, the, outputs, of, what, he, termed, productive, and, unproductive, labor, the, former, he, stated, produced, goods, that, could, be, stored, after, production, and, subsequently, exchanged, for, money, or, other, items, of, value, the, latter, however, useful, or, necessary, created, services, that, perished, at, the, time, of, production, and, therefore, did, not, contribute, to, wealth, building, on, this, theme, french, economist, jean, baptiste, say, argued, that, production, and, consumption, were, inseparable, in, services, coining, the, term, immaterial, products, to, describe, them, in, the, modern, day, gustofsson, johnson, describe, a, continuum, with, pure, service, on, one, terminal, point, and, pure, commodity, good, on, the, other, most, products, fall, between, these, two, extremes, for, example, a, restaurant, provides, a, physical, good, the, food, but, also, provides, services, in, the, form, of, ambience, the, setting, and, clearing, of, the, table, etc, and, although, some, utilities, actually, deliver, physical, goods, like, water, utilities, that, deliver, water, utilities, are, usually, treated, as, services, the, following, is, a, list, of, service, industries, grouped, into, sectors, parenthetical, notations, indicate, how, specific, occupations, and, organizations, can, be, regarded, as, service, industries, to, the, extent, they, provide, an, intangible, service, as, opposed, to, a, tangible,
