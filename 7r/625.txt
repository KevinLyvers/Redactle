political, science, is, the, scientific, study, of, politics, it, is, a, social, science, dealing, with, systems, of, governance, and, power, and, the, analysis, of, political, activities, political, thought, political, behavior, and, associated, constitutions, and, laws, modern, political, science, can, generally, be, divided, into, the, three, sub, disciplines, comparative, politics, international, relations, and, political, theory, political, science, is, a, social, science, dealing, with, systems, of, governance, and, power, and, the, analysis, of, political, activities, political, institutions, political, thought, and, behavior, and, associated, constitutions, and, laws, as, a, social, science, contemporary, political, science, started, to, take, shape, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, began, to, separate, itself, from, political, philosophy, and, history, into, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, still, uncommon, for, political, science, to, be, considered, a, distinct, field, from, history, the, term, political, science, was, not, always, distinguished, from, political, philosophy, and, the, modern, discipline, has, a, clear, set, of, antecedents, including, moral, philosophy, political, economy, political, theology, history, and, other, fields, concerned, with, normative, determinations, of, what, ought, to, be, and, with, deducing, the, characteristics, and, functions, of, the, ideal, state, generally, classical, political, philosophy, is, primarily, defined, by, a, concern, for, hellenic, and, enlightenment, thought, political, scientists, are, also, marked, by, a, great, concern, for, modernity, and, the, contemporary, nation, state, along, with, the, study, of, classical, thought, and, as, such, share, more, terminology, with, sociologists, e, g, structure, and, agency, the, advent, of, political, science, as, a, university, discipline, was, marked, by, the, creation, of, university, departments, and, chairs, with, the, title, of, political, science, arising, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, designation, political, scientist, is, commonly, used, to, denote, someone, with, a, doctorate, or, master, s, degree, in, the, field, integrating, political, studies, of, the, past, into, a, unified, discipline, is, ongoing, and, the, history, of, political, science, has, provided, a, rich, field, for, the, growth, of, both, normative, and, positive, political, science, with, each, part, of, the, discipline, sharing, some, historical, predecessors, the, american, political, science, association, and, the, american, political, science, review, were, founded, in, 1903, and, 1906, respectively, in, an, effort, to, distinguish, the, study, of, politics, from, economics, and, other, social, phenomena, apsa, membership, rose, from, 204, in, 1904, to, 1, 462, in, 1915, apsa, members, played, a, key, role, in, setting, up, political, science, departments, that, were, distinct, from, history, philosophy, law, sociology, and, economics, the, journal, political, science, quarterly, was, established, in, 1886, by, the, academy, of, political, science, in, the, inaugural, issue, of, political, science, quarterly, munroe, smith, defined, political, science, as, the, science, of, the, state, taken, in, this, sense, it, includes, the, organization, and, functions, of, the, state, and, the, relation, of, states, one, to, another, as, part, of, a, unesco, initiative, to, promote, political, science, in, the, late, 1940s, the, international, political, science, association, was, founded, in, 1949, as, well, as, national, associations, in, france, in, 1949, britain, in, 1950, and, west, germany, in, 1951, in, the, 1950s, and, the, 1960s, a, behavioral, revolution, stressing, the, systematic, and, rigorously, scientific, study, of, individual, and, group, behavior, swept, the, discipline, a, focus, on, studying, political, behavior, rather, than, institutions, or, interpretation, of, legal, texts, characterized, early, behavioral, political, science, including, work, by, robert, dahl, philip, converse, and, in, the, collaboration, between, sociologist, paul, lazarsfeld, and, public, opinion, scholar, bernard, berelson, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, witnessed, a, takeoff, in, the, use, of, deductive, game, theoretic, formal, modelling, techniques, aimed, at, generating, a, more, analytical, corpus, of, knowledge, in, the, discipline, this, period, saw, a, surge, of, research, that, borrowed, theory, and, methods, from, economics, to, study, political, institutions, such, as, the, united, states, congress, as, well, as, political, behavior, such, as, voting, william, h, riker, and, his, colleagues, and, students, at, the, university, of, rochester, were, the, main, proponents, of, this, shift, despite, considerable, research, progress, in, the, discipline, based, on, all, types, of, scholarship, discussed, above, scholars, have, noted, that, progress, toward, systematic, theory, has, been, modest, and, uneven, in, 2000, the, perestroika, movement, in, political, science, was, introduced, as, a, reaction, against, what, supporters, of, the, movement, called, the, mathematicization, of, political, science, those, who, identified, with, the, movement, argued, for, a, plurality, of, methodologies, and, approaches, in, political, science, and, for, more, relevance, of, the, discipline, to, those, outside, of, it, some, evolutionary, psychology, theories, argue, that, humans, have, evolved, a, highly, developed, set, of, psychological, mechanisms, for, dealing, with, politics, however, these, mechanisms, evolved, for, dealing, with, the, small, group, politics, that, characterized, the, ancestral, environment, and, not, the, much, larger, political, structures, in, today, s, world, this, is, argued, to, explain, many, important, features, and, systematic, cognitive, biases, of, current, politics, political, science, is, a, social, study, concerning, the, allocation, and, transfer, of, power, in, decision, making, the, roles, and, systems, of, governance, including, governments, and, international, organizations, political, behaviour, and, public, policies, it, measures, the, success, of, governance, and, specific, policies, by, examining, many, factors, including, stability, justice, material, wealth, peace, and, public, health, some, political, scientists, seek, to, advance, positive, theses, which, attempt, to, describe, how, things, are, as, opposed, to, how, they, should, be, by, analysing, politics, others, advance, normative, theses, such, as, by, making, specific, policy, recommendations, the, study, of, politics, and, policies, can, be, closely, connected, for, example, in, comparative, analyses, of, which, types, of, political, institutions, tend, to, produce, certain, types, of, policies, political, science, provides, analysis, and, predictions, about, political, and, governmental, issues, political, scientists, examine, the, processes, systems, and, political, dynamics, of, countries, and, regions, of, the, world, often, to, raise, public, awareness, or, to, influence, specific, governments, political, scientists, may, provide, the, frameworks, from, which, journalists, special, interest, groups, politicians, and, the, electorate, analyze, issues, according, to, chaturvedy, political, scientists, may, serve, as, advisers, to, specific, politicians, or, even, run, for, office, as, politicians, themselves, political, scientists, can, be, found, working, in, governments, in, political, parties, or, as, civil, servants, they, may, be, involved, with, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, or, political, movements, in, a, variety, of, capacities, people, educated, and, trained, in, political, science, can, add, value, and, expertise, to, corporations, private, enterprises, such, as, think, tanks, research, institutes, polling, and, public, relations, firms, often, employ, political, scientists, political, scientists, may, study, political, phenomena, within, one, specific, country, for, example, they, may, study, just, the, politics, of, the, united, states, or, just, the, politics, of, china, political, scientists, look, at, a, variety, of, data, including, constitutions, elections, public, opinion, and, public, policy, foreign, policy, legislatures, and, judiciaries, political, scientists, will, often, focus, on, the, politics, of, their, own, country, for, example, a, political, scientist, from, indonesia, may, become, an, expert, in, the, politics, of, indonesia, the, theory, of, political, transitions, and, the, methods, of, analyzing, and, anticipating, crises, form, an, important, part, of, political, science, several, general, indicators, of, crises, and, methods, were, proposed, for, anticipating, critical, transitions, among, them, one, statistical, indicator, of, crisis, a, simultaneous, increase, of, variance, and, correlations, in, large, groups, was, proposed, for, crisis, anticipation, and, may, be, successfully, used, in, various, areas, its, applicability, for, early, diagnosis, of, political, crises, was, demonstrated, by, the, analysis, of, the, prolonged, stress, period, preceding, the, 2014, ukrainian, economic, and, political, crisis, there, was, a, simultaneous, increase, in, the, total, correlation, between, the, 19, major, public, fears, in, the, ukrainian, society, by, about, 64, and, in, their, statistical, dispersion, by, 29, during, the, pre, crisis, years, a, feature, shared, by, certain, major, revolutions, is, that, they, were, not, predicted, the, theory, of, apparent, inevitability, of, crises, and, revolutions, was, also, developed, the, study, of, major, crises, both, political, crises, and, external, crises, that, can, affect, politics, is, not, limited, to, attempts, to, predict, regime, transitions, or, major, changes, in, political, institutions, political, scientists, also, study, how, governments, handle, unexpected, disasters, and, how, voters, in, democracies, react, to, their, governments, preparations, for, and, responses, to, crises, political, science, is, methodologically, diverse, and, appropriates, many, methods, originating, in, psychology, social, research, political, philosophy, and, many, others, in, addition, to, those, that, developed, chiefly, within, the, field, of, political, science, political, scientists, approach, the, study, of, politics, from, a, host, of, different, ontological, orientations, and, with, a, variety, of, different, tools, because, political, science, is, essentially, a, study, of, human, behavior, in, all, aspects, of, politics, observations, in, controlled, environments, are, often, challenging, to, reproduce, or, duplicate, though, experimental, methods, are, increasingly, common, see, experimental, political, science, citing, this, difficulty, former, american, political, science, association, president, lawrence, lowell, once, said, we, are, limited, by, the, impossibility, of, experiment, politics, is, an, observational, not, an, experimental, science, because, of, this, political, scientists, have, historically, observed, political, elites, institutions, and, individual, or, group, behaviour, in, order, to, identify, patterns, draw, generalizations, and, build, theories, of, politics, like, all, social, sciences, political, science, faces, the, difficulty, of, observing, human, actors, that, can, only, be, partially, observed, and, who, have, the, capacity, for, making, conscious, choices, unlike, other, subjects, such, as, non, human, organisms, in, biology, minerals, in, geoscience, chemical, elements, in, chemistry, stars, in, astronomy, or, particles, in, physics, despite, the, complexities, contemporary, political, science, has, progressed, by, adopting, a, variety, of, methods, and, theoretical, approaches, to, understanding, politics, and, methodological, pluralism, is, a, defining, feature, of, contemporary, political, science, empirical, political, science, methods, include, the, use, of, field, experiments, surveys, and, survey, experiments, case, studies, process, tracing, historical, and, institutional, analysis, ethnography, participant, observation, and, interview, research, political, scientists, also, use, and, develop, theoretical, tools, like, game, theory, and, agent, based, models, to, study, a, host, of, political, systems, and, situations, other, approaches, include, the, study, of, equation, based, models, and, opinion, dynamics, political, theorists, approach, theories, of, political, phenomena, with, a, similar, diversity, of, positions, and, tools, including, feminist, political, theory, historical, analysis, associated, with, the, cambridge, school, and, straussian, approaches, political, science, may, overlap, with, topics, of, study, that, are, the, traditional, focuses, of, other, social, sciences, for, example, when, sociological, norms, or, psychological, biases, are, connected, to, political, phenomena, in, these, cases, political, science, may, either, inherit, their, methods, of, study, or, develop, a, contrasting, approach, for, example, lisa, wedeen, has, argued, that, political, science, s, approach, to, the, idea, of, culture, originating, with, gabriel, almond, and, sidney, verba, and, exemplified, by, authors, like, samuel, p, huntington, could, benefit, from, aligning, more, closely, with, the, study, of, culture, in, anthropology, in, turn, methodologies, that, are, developed, within, political, science, may, influence, how, researchers, in, other, fields, like, public, health, conceive, of, and, approach, political, processes, and, policies, the, most, common, piece, of, academic, writing, in, generalist, political, sciences, is, the, research, paper, which, investigates, an, original, research, question, political, science, possibly, like, the, social, sciences, as, a, whole, can, be, described, as, a, discipline, which, lives, on, the, fault, line, between, the, two, cultures, in, the, academy, the, sciences, and, the, humanities, thus, in, most, american, colleges, especially, liberal, arts, colleges, it, would, be, located, within, the, school, or, college, of, arts, and, sciences, if, no, separate, college, of, arts, and, sciences, exists, or, if, the, college, or, university, prefers, that, it, be, in, a, separate, constituent, college, or, academic, department, then, political, science, may, be, a, separate, department, housed, as, part, of, a, division, or, school, of, humanities, or, liberal, arts, at, some, universities, especially, research, universities, and, in, particular, those, that, have, a, strong, cooperation, between, research, undergraduate, and, graduate, faculty, with, a, stronger, more, applied, emphasis, in, public, administration, political, science, would, be, taught, by, the, university, s, public, policy, school, most, united, states, colleges, and, universities, offer, ba, programs, in, political, science, ma, or, mat, and, phd, or, edd, programs, are, common, at, larger, universities, the, term, political, science, is, more, popular, in, post, 1960s, north, america, than, elsewhere, while, universities, predating, the, 1960s, or, those, historically, influenced, by, them, would, call, the, field, of, study, government, other, institutions, especially, those, outside, the, united, states, see, political, science, as, part, of, a, broader, discipline, of, political, studies, or, politics, in, general, while, political, science, implies, the, use, of, the, scientific, method, political, studies, implies, a, broader, approach, although, the, naming, of, degree, courses, does, not, necessarily, reflect, their, content, separate, specialized, or, in, some, cases, professional, degree, programs, in, international, relations, public, policy, and, public, administration, are, common, at, both, the, undergraduate, and, postgraduate, levels, although, most, but, not, all, undergraduate, level, education, in, these, sub, fields, of, political, science, is, generally, found, in, academic, concentrations, within, a, political, science, academic, major, master, s, level, programs, in, public, administration, are, professional, degrees, covering, public, policy, along, with, other, applied, subjects, they, are, often, seen, as, more, linked, to, politics, than, any, other, discipline, which, may, be, reflected, by, being, housed, in, that, department, the, main, national, honor, society, for, college, and, university, students, of, government, and, politics, in, the, united, states, is, pi, sigma, alpha, while, pi, alpha, alpha, is, a, national, honor, society, specifically, designated, for, public, administration
