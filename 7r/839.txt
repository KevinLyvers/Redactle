https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)
race, is, a, categorization, of, humans, based, on, shared, physical, or, social, qualities, into, groups, generally, viewed, as, distinct, within, a, given, society, the, term, came, into, common, usage, during, the, 16th, century, when, it, was, used, to, refer, to, groups, of, various, kinds, including, those, characterized, by, close, kinship, relations, by, the, 17th, century, the, term, began, to, refer, to, physical, phenotypical, traits, and, then, later, to, national, affiliations, modern, science, regards, race, as, a, social, construct, an, identity, which, is, assigned, based, on, rules, made, by, society, while, partly, based, on, physical, similarities, within, groups, race, does, not, have, an, inherent, physical, or, biological, meaning, the, concept, of, race, is, foundational, to, racism, the, belief, that, humans, can, be, divided, based, on, the, superiority, of, one, race, over, another, social, conceptions, and, groupings, of, races, have, varied, over, time, often, involving, folk, taxonomies, that, define, essential, types, of, individuals, based, on, perceived, traits, modern, scientists, consider, such, biological, essentialism, obsolete, and, generally, discourage, racial, explanations, for, collective, differentiation, in, both, physical, and, behavioral, traits, even, though, there, is, a, broad, scientific, agreement, that, essentialist, and, typological, conceptions, of, race, are, untenable, scientists, around, the, world, continue, to, conceptualize, race, in, widely, differing, ways, while, some, researchers, continue, to, use, the, concept, of, race, to, make, distinctions, among, fuzzy, sets, of, traits, or, observable, differences, in, behavior, others, in, the, scientific, community, suggest, that, the, idea, of, race, is, inherently, naive, or, simplistic, still, others, argue, that, among, humans, race, has, no, taxonomic, significance, because, all, living, humans, belong, to, the, same, subspecies, homo, sapiens, sapiens, since, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, race, has, been, associated, with, discredited, theories, of, scientific, racism, and, has, become, increasingly, seen, as, a, largely, pseudoscientific, system, of, classification, although, still, used, in, general, contexts, race, has, often, been, replaced, by, less, ambiguous, and, or, loaded, terms, populations, people, s, ethnic, groups, or, communities, depending, on, context, its, use, in, genetics, was, formally, renounced, by, the, u, s, national, academies, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, in, 2023, modern, scholarship, views, racial, categories, as, socially, constructed, that, is, race, is, not, intrinsic, to, human, beings, but, rather, an, identity, created, often, by, socially, dominant, groups, to, establish, meaning, in, a, social, context, different, cultures, define, different, racial, groups, often, focused, on, the, largest, groups, of, social, relevance, and, these, definitions, can, change, over, time, historical, race, concepts, have, included, a, wide, variety, of, schemes, to, divide, local, or, worldwide, populations, into, races, and, sub, races, across, the, world, different, organizations, and, societies, choose, to, disambiguate, race, to, different, extents, the, establishment, of, racial, boundaries, often, involves, the, subjugation, of, groups, defined, as, racially, inferior, as, in, the, one, drop, rule, used, in, the, 19th, century, united, states, to, exclude, those, with, any, amount, of, african, ancestry, from, the, dominant, racial, grouping, defined, as, white, such, racial, identities, reflect, the, cultural, attitudes, of, imperial, powers, dominant, during, the, age, of, european, colonial, expansion, this, view, rejects, the, notion, that, race, is, biologically, defined, according, to, geneticist, david, reich, while, race, may, be, a, social, construct, differences, in, genetic, ancestry, that, happen, to, correlate, to, many, of, today, s, racial, constructs, are, real, in, response, to, reich, a, group, of, 67, scientists, from, a, broad, range, of, disciplines, wrote, that, his, concept, of, race, was, flawed, as, the, meaning, and, significance, of, the, groups, is, produced, through, social, interventions, although, commonalities, in, physical, traits, such, as, facial, features, skin, color, and, hair, texture, comprise, part, of, the, race, concept, this, linkage, is, a, social, distinction, rather, than, an, inherently, biological, one, other, dimensions, of, racial, groupings, include, shared, history, traditions, and, language, for, instance, african, american, english, is, a, language, spoken, by, many, african, americans, especially, in, areas, of, the, united, states, where, racial, segregation, exists, furthermore, people, often, self, identify, as, members, of, a, race, for, political, reasons, when, people, define, and, talk, about, a, particular, conception, of, race, they, create, a, social, reality, through, which, social, categorization, is, achieved, in, this, sense, races, are, said, to, be, social, constructs, these, constructs, develop, within, various, legal, economic, and, sociopolitical, contexts, and, may, be, the, effect, rather, than, the, cause, of, major, social, situations, while, race, is, understood, to, be, a, social, construct, by, many, most, scholars, agree, that, race, has, real, material, effects, in, the, lives, of, people, through, institutionalized, practices, of, preference, and, discrimination, socioeconomic, factors, in, combination, with, early, but, enduring, views, of, race, have, led, to, considerable, suffering, within, disadvantaged, racial, groups, racial, discrimination, often, coincides, with, racist, mindsets, whereby, the, individuals, and, ideologies, of, one, group, come, to, perceive, the, members, of, an, outgroup, as, both, racially, defined, and, morally, inferior, as, a, result, racial, groups, possessing, relatively, little, power, often, find, themselves, excluded, or, oppressed, while, hegemonic, individuals, and, institutions, are, charged, with, holding, racist, attitudes, racism, has, led, to, many, instances, of, tragedy, including, slavery, and, genocide, in, some, countries, law, enforcement, uses, race, to, profile, suspects, this, use, of, racial, categories, is, frequently, criticized, for, perpetuating, an, outmoded, understanding, of, human, biological, variation, and, promoting, stereotypes, because, in, some, societies, racial, groupings, correspond, closely, with, patterns, of, social, stratification, for, social, scientists, studying, social, inequality, race, can, be, a, significant, variable, as, sociological, factors, racial, categories, may, in, part, reflect, subjective, attributions, self, identities, and, social, institutions, scholars, continue, to, debate, the, degrees, to, which, racial, categories, are, biologically, warranted, and, socially, constructed, for, example, in, 2008, john, hartigan, jr, argued, for, a, view, of, race, that, focused, primarily, on, culture, but, which, does, not, ignore, the, potential, relevance, of, biology, or, genetics, accordingly, the, racial, paradigms, employed, in, different, disciplines, vary, in, their, emphasis, on, biological, reduction, as, contrasted, with, societal, construction, in, the, social, sciences, theoretical, frameworks, such, as, racial, formation, theory, and, critical, race, theory, investigate, implications, of, race, as, social, construction, by, exploring, how, the, images, ideas, and, assumptions, of, race, are, expressed, in, everyday, life, a, large, body, of, scholarship, has, traced, the, relationships, between, the, historical, social, production, of, race, in, legal, and, criminal, language, and, their, effects, on, the, policing, and, disproportionate, incarceration, of, certain, groups, groups, of, humans, have, always, identified, themselves, as, distinct, from, neighboring, groups, but, such, differences, have, not, always, been, understood, to, be, natural, immutable, and, global, these, features, are, the, distinguishing, features, of, how, the, concept, of, race, is, used, today, in, this, way, the, idea, of, race, as, we, understand, it, today, came, about, during, the, historical, process, of, exploration, and, conquest, which, brought, europeans, into, contact, with, groups, from, different, continents, and, of, the, ideology, of, classification, and, typology, found, in, the, natural, sciences, the, term, race, was, often, used, in, a, general, biological, taxonomic, sense, starting, from, the, 19th, century, to, denote, genetically, differentiated, human, populations, defined, by, phenotype, the, modern, concept, of, race, emerged, as, a, product, of, the, colonial, enterprises, of, european, powers, from, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, which, identified, race, in, terms, of, skin, color, and, physical, differences, author, rebecca, f, kennedy, argues, that, the, greeks, and, romans, would, have, found, such, concepts, confusing, in, relation, to, their, own, systems, of, classification, according, to, bancel, et, al, the, epistemological, moment, where, the, modern, concept, of, race, was, invented, and, rationalized, lies, somewhere, between, 1730, and, 1790, according, to, smedley, and, marks, the, european, concept, of, race, along, with, many, of, the, ideas, now, associated, with, the, term, arose, at, the, time, of, the, scientific, revolution, which, introduced, and, privileged, the, study, of, natural, kinds, and, the, age, of, european, imperialism, and, colonization, which, established, political, relations, between, europeans, and, peoples, with, distinct, cultural, and, political, traditions, as, europeans, encountered, people, from, different, parts, of, the, world, they, speculated, about, the, physical, social, and, cultural, differences, among, various, human, groups, the, rise, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, which, gradually, displaced, an, earlier, trade, in, slaves, from, throughout, the, world, created, a, further, incentive, to, categorize, human, groups, in, order, to, justify, the, subordination, of, african, slaves, drawing, on, sources, from, classical, antiquity, and, upon, their, own, internal, interactions, for, example, the, hostility, between, the, english, and, irish, powerfully, influenced, early, european, thinking, about, the, differences, between, people, europeans, began, to, sort, themselves, and, others, into, groups, based, on, physical, appearance, and, to, attribute, to, individuals, belonging, to, these, groups, behaviors, and, capacities, which, were, claimed, to, be, deeply, ingrained, a, set, of, folk, beliefs, took, hold, that, linked, inherited, physical, differences, between, groups, to, inherited, intellectual, behavioral, and, moral, qualities, similar, ideas, can, be, found, in, other, cultures, for, example, in, china, where, a, concept, often, translated, as, race, was, associated, with, supposed, common, descent, from, the, yellow, emperor, and, used, to, stress, the, unity, of, ethnic, groups, in, china, brutal, conflicts, between, ethnic, groups, have, existed, throughout, history, and, across, the, world, the, first, post, graeco, roman, published, classification, of, humans, into, distinct, races, seems, to, be, fran, ois, bernier, s, nouvelle, division, de, la, terre, par, les, diff, rents, esp, ces, ou, races, qui, l, habitent, new, division, of, earth, by, the, different, species, or, races, which, inhabit, it, published, in, 1684, in, the, 18th, century, the, differences, among, human, groups, became, a, focus, of, scientific, investigation, but, the, scientific, classification, of, phenotypic, variation, was, frequently, coupled, with, racist, ideas, about, innate, predispositions, of, different, groups, always, attributing, the, most, desirable, features, to, the, white, european, race, and, arranging, the, other, races, along, a, continuum, of, progressively, undesirable, attributes, the, 1735, classification, of, carl, linnaeus, inventor, of, zoological, taxonomy, divided, the, human, species, homo, sapiens, into, continental, varieties, of, europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and, afer, each, associated, with, a, different, humour, sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and, phlegmatic, respectively, homo, sapiens, europaeus, was, described, as, active, acute, and, adventurous, whereas, homo, sapiens, afer, was, said, to, be, crafty, lazy, and, careless, the, 1775, treatise, the, natural, varieties, of, mankind, by, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, proposed, five, major, divisions, the, caucasoid, race, the, mongoloid, race, the, ethiopian, race, later, termed, negroid, the, american, indian, race, and, the, malayan, race, but, he, did, not, propose, any, hierarchy, among, the, races, blumenbach, also, noted, the, graded, transition, in, appearances, from, one, group, to, adjacent, groups, and, suggested, that, one, variety, of, mankind, does, so, sensibly, pass, into, the, other, that, you, cannot, mark, out, the, limits, between, them, from, the, 17th, through, 19th, centuries, the, merging, of, folk, beliefs, about, group, differences, with, scientific, explanations, of, those, differences, produced, what, smedley, has, called, an, ideology, of, race, according, to, this, ideology, races, are, primordial, natural, enduring, and, distinct, it, was, further, argued, that, some, groups, may, be, the, result, of, mixture, between, formerly, distinct, populations, but, that, careful, study, could, distinguish, the, ancestral, races, that, had, combined, to, produce, admixed, groups, subsequent, influential, classifications, by, georges, buffon, petrus, camper, and, christoph, meiners, all, classified, negros, as, inferior, to, europeans, in, the, united, states, the, racial, theories, of, thomas, jefferson, were, influential, he, saw, africans, as, inferior, to, whites, especially, in, regards, to, their, intellect, and, imbued, with, unnatural, sexual, appetites, but, described, native, americans, as, equals, to, whites, in, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 18th, century, the, theory, of, polygenism, the, belief, that, different, races, had, evolved, separately, in, each, continent, and, shared, no, common, ancestor, was, advocated, in, england, by, historian, edward, long, and, anatomist, charles, white, in, germany, by, ethnographers, christoph, meiners, and, georg, forster, and, in, france, by, julien, joseph, virey, in, the, us, samuel, george, morton, josiah, nott, and, louis, agassiz, promoted, this, theory, in, the, mid, 19th, century, polygenism, was, popular, and, most, widespread, in, the, 19th, century, culminating, in, the, founding, of, the, anthropological, society, of, london, 1863, which, during, the, period, of, the, american, civil, war, broke, away, from, the, ethnological, society, of, london, and, its, monogenic, stance, their, underlined, difference, lying, relevantly, in, the, so, called, negro, question, a, substantial, racist, view, by, the, former, and, a, more, liberal, view, on, race, by, the, latter, today, all, humans, are, classified, as, belonging, to, the, species, homo, sapiens, however, this, is, not, the, first, species, of, homininae, the, first, species, of, genus, homo, homo, habilis, evolved, in, east, africa, at, least, 2, million, years, ago, and, members, of, this, species, populated, different, parts, of, africa, in, a, relatively, short, time, homo, erectus, evolved, more, than, 1, 8, million, years, ago, and, by, 1, 5, million, years, ago, had, spread, throughout, europe, and, asia, virtually, all, physical, anthropologists, agree, that, archaic, homo, sapiens, a, group, including, the, possible, species, h, heidelbergensis, h, rhodesiensis, and, h, neanderthalensis, evolved, out, of, african, h, erectus, sensu, lato, or, h, ergaster, anthropologists, support, the, idea, that, anatomically, modern, humans, homo, sapiens, evolved, in, north, or, east, africa, from, an, archaic, human, species, such, as, h, heidelbergensis, and, then, migrated, out, of, africa, mixing, with, and, replacing, h, heidelbergensis, and, h, neanderthalensis, populations, throughout, europe, and, asia, and, h, rhodesiensis, populations, in, sub, saharan, africa, a, combination, of, the, out, of, africa, and, multiregional, models, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, anthropologists, taught, that, race, was, an, entirely, biological, phenomenon, and, that, this, was, core, to, a, person, s, behavior, and, identity, a, position, commonly, called, racial, essentialism, this, coupled, with, a, belief, that, linguistic, cultural, and, social, groups, fundamentally, existed, along, racial, lines, formed, the, basis, of, what, is, now, called, scientific, racism, after, the, nazi, eugenics, program, along, with, the, rise, of, anti, colonial, movements, racial, essentialism, lost, widespread, popularity, new, studies, of, culture, and, the, fledgling, field, of, population, genetics, undermined, the, scientific, standing, of, racial, essentialism, leading, race, anthropologists, to, revise, their, conclusions, about, the, sources, of, phenotypic, variation, a, significant, number, of, modern, anthropologists, and, biologists, in, the, west, came, to, view, race, as, an, invalid, genetic, or, biological, designation, the, first, to, challenge, the, concept, of, race, on, empirical, grounds, were, the, anthropologists, franz, boas, who, provided, evidence, of, phenotypic, plasticity, due, to, environmental, factors, and, ashley, montagu, who, relied, on, evidence, from, genetics, e, o, wilson, then, challenged, the, concept, from, the, perspective, of, general, animal, systematics, and, further, rejected, the, claim, that, races, were, equivalent, to, subspecies, human, genetic, variation, is, predominantly, within, races, continuous, and, complex, in, structure, which, is, inconsistent, with, the, concept, of, genetic, human, races, according, to, the, biological, anthropologist, jonathan, marks, by, the, 1970s, it, had, become, clear, that, 1, most, human, differences, were, cultural, 2, what, was, not, cultural, was, principally, polymorphic, that, is, to, say, found, in, diverse, groups, of, people, at, different, frequencies, 3, what, was, not, cultural, or, polymorphic, was, principally, clinal, that, is, to, say, gradually, variable, over, geography, and, 4, what, was, left, the, component, of, human, diversity, that, was, not, cultural, polymorphic, or, clinal, was, very, small, a, consensus, consequently, developed, among, anthropologists, and, geneticists, that, race, as, the, previous, generation, had, known, it, as, largely, discrete, geographically, distinct, gene, pools, did, not, exist, the, term, race, in, biology, is, used, with, caution, because, it, can, be, ambiguous, generally, when, it, is, used, it, is, effectively, a, synonym, of, subspecies, for, animals, the, only, taxonomic, unit, below, the, species, level, is, usually, the, subspecies, there, are, narrower, infraspecific, ranks, in, botany, and, race, does, not, correspond, directly, with, any, of, them, traditionally, subspecies, are, seen, as, geographically, isolated, and, genetically, differentiated, populations, studies, of, human, genetic, variation, show, that, human, populations, are, not, geographically, isolated, and, their, genetic, differences, are, far, smaller, than, those, among, comparable, subspecies, in, 1978, sewall, wright, suggested, that, human, populations, that, have, long, inhabited, separated, parts, of, the, world, should, in, general, be, considered, different, subspecies, by, the, criterion, that, most, individuals, of, such, populations, can, be, allocated, correctly, by, inspection, wright, argued, it, does, not, require, a, trained, anthropologist, to, classify, an, array, of, englishmen, west, africans, and, chinese, with, 100, accuracy, by, features, skin, color, and, type, of, hair, despite, so, much, variability, within, each, of, these, groups, that, every, individual, can, easily, be, distinguished, from, every, other, while, in, practice, subspecies, are, often, defined, by, easily, observable, physical, appearance, there, is, not, necessarily, any, evolutionary, significance, to, these, observed, differences, so, this, form, of, classification, has, become, less, acceptable, to, evolutionary, biologists, likewise, this, typological, approach, to, race, is, generally, regarded, as, discredited, by, biologists, and, anthropologists, in, 2000, philosopher, robin, andreasen, proposed, that, cladistics, might, be, used, to, categorize, human, races, biologically, and, that, races, can, be, both, biologically, real, and, socially, constructed, andreasen, cited, tree, diagrams, of, relative, genetic, distances, among, populations, published, by, luigi, cavalli, sforza, as, the, basis, for, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, human, races, p, 661, biological, anthropologist, jonathan, marks, 2008, responded, by, arguing, that, andreasen, had, misinterpreted, the, genetic, literature, these, trees, are, phenetic, based, on, similarity, rather, than, cladistic, based, on, monophyletic, descent, that, is, from, a, series, of, unique, ancestors, evolutionary, biologist, alan, templeton, 2013, argued, that, multiple, lines, of, evidence, falsify, the, idea, of, a, phylogenetic, tree, structure, to, human, genetic, diversity, and, confirm, the, presence, of, gene, flow, among, populations, marks, templeton, and, cavalli, sforza, all, conclude, that, genetics, does, not, provide, evidence, of, human, races, previously, anthropologists, lieberman, and, jackson, 1995, had, also, critiqued, the, use, of, cladistics, to, support, concepts, of, race, they, argued, that, the, molecular, and, biochemical, proponents, of, this, model, explicitly, use, racial, categories, in, their, initial, grouping, of, samples, for, example, the, large, and, highly, diverse, macroethnic, groups, of, east, indians, north, africans, and, europeans, are, presumptively, grouped, as, caucasians, prior, to, the, analysis, of, their, dna, variation, they, argued, that, this, a, priori, grouping, limits, and, skews, interpretations, obscures, other, lineage, relationships, deemphasizes, the, impact, of, more, immediate, clinal, environmental, factors, on, genomic, diversity, and, can, cloud, our, understanding, of, the, true, patterns, of, affinity, in, 2015, keith, hunley, graciela, cabana, and, jeffrey, long, analyzed, the, human, genome, diversity, project, sample, of, 1, 037, individuals, in, 52, populations, finding, that, diversity, among, non, african, populations, is, the, result, of, a, serial, founder, effect, process, with, non, african, populations, as, a, whole, nested, among, african, populations, that, some, african, populations, are, equally, related, to, other, african, populations, and, to, non, african, populations, and, that, outside, of, africa, regional, groupings, of, populations, are, nested, inside, one, another, and, many, of, them, are, not, monophyletic, earlier, research, had, also, suggested, that, there, has, always, been, considerable, gene, flow, between, human, populations, meaning, that, human, population, groups, are, not, monophyletic, rachel, caspari, has, argued, that, since, no, groups, currently, regarded, as, races, are, monophyletic, by, definition, none, of, these, groups, can, be, clades, one, crucial, innovation, in, reconceptualizing, genotypic, and, phenotypic, variation, was, the, anthropologist, c, loring, brace, s, observation, that, such, variations, insofar, as, they, are, affected, by, natural, selection, slow, migration, or, genetic, drift, are, distributed, along, geographic, gradations, or, clines, for, example, with, respect, to, skin, color, in, europe, and, africa, brace, writes, to, this, day, skin, color, grades, by, imperceptible, means, from, europe, southward, around, the, eastern, end, of, the, mediterranean, and, up, the, nile, into, africa, from, one, end, of, this, range, to, the, other, there, is, no, hint, of, a, skin, color, boundary, and, yet, the, spectrum, runs, from, the, lightest, in, the, world, at, the, northern, edge, to, as, dark, as, it, is, possible, for, humans, to, be, at, the, equator, in, part, this, is, due, to, isolation, by, distance, this, point, called, attention, to, a, problem, common, to, phenotype, based, descriptions, of, races, for, example, those, based, on, hair, texture, and, skin, color, they, ignore, a, host, of, other, similarities, and, differences, for, example, blood, type, that, do, not, correlate, highly, with, the, markers, for, race, thus, anthropologist, frank, livingstone, s, conclusion, was, that, since, clines, cross, racial, boundaries, there, are, no, races, only, clines, in, a, response, to, livingstone, theodore, dobzhansky, argued, that, when, talking, about, race, one, must, be, attentive, to, how, the, term, is, being, used, i, agree, with, dr, livingstone, that, if, races, have, to, be, discrete, units, then, there, are, no, races, and, if, race, is, used, as, an, explanation, of, the, human, variability, rather, than, vice, versa, then, the, explanation, is, invalid, he, further, argued, that, one, could, use, the, term, race, if, one, distinguished, between, race, differences, and, the, race, concept, the, former, refers, to, any, distinction, in, gene, frequencies, between, populations, the, latter, is, a, matter, of, judgment, he, further, observed, that, even, when, there, is, clinal, variation, race, differences, are, objectively, ascertainable, biological, phenomena, but, it, does, not, follow, that, racially, distinct, populations, must, be, given, racial, or, subspecific, labels, in, short, livingstone, and, dobzhansky, agree, that, there, are, genetic, differences, among, human, beings, they, also, agree, that, the, use, of, the, race, concept, to, classify, people, and, how, the, race, concept, is, used, is, a, matter, of, social, convention, they, differ, on, whether, the, race, concept, remains, a, meaningful, and, useful, social, convention, in, 1964, the, biologists, paul, ehrlich, and, holm, pointed, out, cases, where, two, or, more, clines, are, distributed, discordantly, for, example, melanin, is, distributed, in, a, decreasing, pattern, from, the, equator, north, and, south, frequencies, for, the, haplotype, for, beta, s, hemoglobin, on, the, other, hand, radiate, out, of, specific, geographical, points, in, africa, as, the, anthropologists, leonard, lieberman, and, fatimah, linda, jackson, observed, discordant, patterns, of, heterogeneity, falsify, any, description, of, a, population, as, if, it, were, genotypically, or, even, phenotypically, homogeneous, patterns, such, as, those, seen, in, human, physical, and, genetic, variation, as, described, above, have, led, to, the, consequence, that, the, number, and, geographic, location, of, any, described, races, is, highly, dependent, on, the, importance, attributed, to, and, quantity, of, the, traits, considered, a, skin, lightening, mutation, estimated, to, have, occurred, 20, 000, to, 50, 000, years, ago, partially, accounts, for, the, appearance, of, light, skin, in, people, who, migrated, out, of, africa, northward, into, what, is, now, europe, east, asians, owe, their, relatively, light, skin, to, different, mutations, on, the, other, hand, the, greater, the, number, of, traits, or, alleles, considered, the, more, subdivisions, of, humanity, are, detected, since, traits, and, gene, frequencies, do, not, always, correspond, to, the, same, geographical, location, or, as, ossorio, duster, 2005, put, it, anthropologists, long, ago, discovered, that, humans, physical, traits, vary, gradually, with, groups, that, are, close, geographic, neighbors, being, more, similar, than, groups, that, are, geographically, separated, this, pattern, of, variation, known, as, clinal, variation, is, also, observed, for, many, alleles, that, vary, from, one, human, group, to, another, another, observation, is, that, traits, or, alleles, that, vary, from, one, group, to, another, do, not, vary, at, the, same, rate, this, pattern, is, referred, to, as, nonconcordant, variation, because, the, variation, of, physical, traits, is, clinal, and, nonconcordant, anthropologists, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, discovered, that, the, more, traits, and, the, more, human, groups, they, measured, the, fewer, discrete, differences, they, observed, among, races, and, the, more, categories, they, had, to, create, to, classify, human, beings, the, number, of, races, observed, expanded, to, the, 1930s, and, 1950s, and, eventually, anthropologists, concluded, that, there, were, no, discrete, races, twentieth, and, 21st, century, biomedical, researchers, have, discovered, this, same, feature, when, evaluating, human, variation, at, the, level, of, alleles, and, allele, frequencies, nature, has, not, created, four, or, five, distinct, nonoverlapping, genetic, groups, of, people, another, way, to, look, at, differences, between, populations, is, to, measure, genetic, differences, rather, than, physical, differences, between, groups, the, mid, 20th, century, anthropologist, william, c, boyd, defined, race, as, a, population, which, differs, significantly, from, other, populations, in, regard, to, the, frequency, of, one, or, more, of, the, genes, it, possesses, it, is, an, arbitrary, matter, which, and, how, many, gene, loci, we, choose, to, consider, as, a, significant, constellation, leonard, lieberman, and, rodney, kirk, have, pointed, out, that, the, paramount, weakness, of, this, statement, is, that, if, one, gene, can, distinguish, races, then, the, number, of, races, is, as, numerous, as, the, number, of, human, couples, reproducing, moreover, the, anthropologist, stephen, molnar, has, suggested, that, the, discordance, of, clines, inevitably, results, in, a, multiplication, of, races, that, renders, the, concept, itself, useless, the, human, genome, project, states, people, who, have, lived, in, the, same, geographic, region, for, many, generations, may, have, some, alleles, in, common, but, no, allele, will, be, found, in, all, members, of, one, population, and, in, no, members, of, any, other, massimo, pigliucci, and, jonathan, kaplan, argue, that, human, races, do, exist, and, that, they, correspond, to, the, genetic, classification, of, ecotypes, but, that, real, human, races, do, not, correspond, very, much, if, at, all, to, folk, racial, categories, in, contrast, walsh, yun, reviewed, the, literature, in, 2011, and, reported, genetic, studies, using, very, few, chromosomal, loci, find, that, genetic, polymorphisms, divide, human, populations, into, clusters, with, almost, 100, percent, accuracy, and, that, they, correspond, to, the, traditional, anthropological, categories, some, biologists, argue, that, racial, categories, correlate, with, biological, traits, e, g, phenotype, and, that, certain, genetic, markers, have, varying, frequencies, among, human, populations, some, of, which, correspond, more, or, less, to, traditional, racial, groupings, the, distribution, of, genetic, variants, within, and, among, human, populations, are, impossible, to, describe, succinctly, because, of, the, difficulty, of, defining, a, population, the, clinal, nature, of, variation, and, heterogeneity, across, the, genome, long, and, kittles, 2003, in, general, however, an, average, of, 85, of, statistical, genetic, variation, exists, within, local, populations, 7, is, between, local, populations, within, the, same, continent, and, 8, of, variation, occurs, between, large, groups, living, on, different, continents, the, recent, african, origin, theory, for, humans, would, predict, that, in, africa, there, exists, a, great, deal, more, diversity, than, elsewhere, and, that, diversity, should, decrease, the, further, from, africa, a, population, is, sampled, hence, the, 85, average, figure, is, misleading, long, and, kittles, find, that, rather, than, 85, of, human, genetic, diversity, existing, in, all, human, populations, about, 100, of, human, diversity, exists, in, a, single, african, population, whereas, only, about, 60, of, human, genetic, diversity, exists, in, the, least, diverse, population, they, analyzed, the, surui, a, population, derived, from, new, guinea, statistical, analysis, that, takes, this, difference, into, account, confirms, previous, findings, that, western, based, racial, classifications, have, no, taxonomic, significance, a, 2002, study, of, random, biallelic, genetic, loci, found, little, to, no, evidence, that, humans, were, divided, into, distinct, biological, groups, in, his, 2003, paper, human, genetic, diversity, lewontin, s, fallacy, a, w, f, edwards, argued, that, rather, than, using, a, locus, by, locus, analysis, of, variation, to, derive, taxonomy, it, is, possible, to, construct, a, human, classification, system, based, on, characteristic, genetic, patterns, or, clusters, inferred, from, multilocus, genetic, data, geographically, based, human, studies, since, have, shown, that, such, genetic, clusters, can, be, derived, from, analyzing, of, a, large, number, of, loci, which, can, assort, individuals, sampled, into, groups, analogous, to, traditional, continental, racial, groups, joanna, mountain, and, neil, risch, cautioned, that, while, genetic, clusters, may, one, day, be, shown, to, correspond, to, phenotypic, variations, between, groups, such, assumptions, were, premature, as, the, relationship, between, genes, and, complex, traits, remains, poorly, understood, however, risch, denied, such, limitations, render, the, analysis, useless, perhaps, just, using, someone, s, actual, birth, year, is, not, a, very, good, way, of, measuring, age, does, that, mean, we, should, throw, it, out, any, category, you, come, up, with, is, going, to, be, imperfect, but, that, doesn, t, preclude, you, from, using, it, or, the, fact, that, it, has, utility, early, human, genetic, cluster, analysis, studies, were, conducted, with, samples, taken, from, ancestral, population, groups, living, at, extreme, geographic, distances, from, each, other, it, was, thought, that, such, large, geographic, distances, would, maximize, the, genetic, variation, between, the, groups, sampled, in, the, analysis, and, thus, maximize, the, probability, of, finding, cluster, patterns, unique, to, each, group, in, light, of, the, historically, recent, acceleration, of, human, migration, and, correspondingly, human, gene, flow, on, a, global, scale, further, studies, were, conducted, to, judge, the, degree, to, which, genetic, cluster, analysis, can, pattern, ancestrally, identified, groups, as, well, as, geographically, separated, groups, one, such, study, looked, at, a, large, multiethnic, population, in, the, united, states, and, detected, only, modest, genetic, differentiation, between, different, current, geographic, locales, within, each, race, ethnicity, group, thus, ancient, geographic, ancestry, which, is, highly, correlated, with, self, identified, race, ethnicity, as, opposed, to, current, residence, is, the, major, determinant, of, genetic, structure, in, the, u, s, population, witherspoon, et, al, 2007, have, argued, that, even, when, individuals, can, be, reliably, assigned, to, specific, population, groups, it, may, still, be, possible, for, two, randomly, chosen, individuals, from, different, populations, clusters, to, be, more, similar, to, each, other, than, to, a, randomly, chosen, member, of, their, own, cluster, they, found, that, many, thousands, of, genetic, markers, had, to, be, used, in, order, for, the, answer, to, the, question, how, often, is, a, pair, of, individuals, from, one, population, genetically, more, dissimilar, than, two, individuals, chosen, from, two, different, populations, to, be, never, this, assumed, three, population, groups, separated, by, large, geographic, ranges, european, african, and, east, asian, the, entire, world, population, is, much, more, complex, and, studying, an, increasing, number, of, groups, would, require, an, increasing, number, of, markers, for, the, same, answer, the, authors, conclude, that, caution, should, be, used, when, using, geographic, or, genetic, ancestry, to, make, inferences, about, individual, phenotypes, witherspoon, et, al, concluded, the, fact, that, given, enough, genetic, data, individuals, can, be, correctly, assigned, to, their, populations, of, origin, is, compatible, with, the, observation, that, most, human, genetic, variation, is, found, within, populations, not, between, them, it, is, also, compatible, with, our, finding, that, even, when, the, most, distinct, populations, are, considered, and, hundreds, of, loci, are, used, individuals, are, frequently, more, similar, to, members, of, other, populations, than, to, members, of, their, own, population, anthropologists, such, as, c, loring, brace, the, philosophers, jonathan, kaplan, and, rasmus, winther, and, the, geneticist, joseph, graves, have, argued, that, the, cluster, structure, of, genetic, data, is, dependent, on, the, initial, hypotheses, of, the, researcher, and, the, influence, of, these, hypotheses, on, the, choice, of, populations, to, sample, when, one, samples, continental, groups, the, clusters, become, continental, but, if, one, had, chosen, other, sampling, patterns, the, clustering, would, be, different, weiss, and, fullerton, have, noted, that, if, one, sampled, only, icelanders, mayans, and, maoris, three, distinct, clusters, would, form, and, all, other, populations, could, be, described, as, being, clinally, composed, of, admixtures, of, maori, icelandic, and, mayan, genetic, materials, kaplan, and, winther, therefore, argue, that, seen, in, this, way, both, lewontin, and, edwards, are, right, in, their, arguments, they, conclude, that, while, racial, groups, are, characterized, by, different, allele, frequencies, this, does, not, mean, that, racial, classification, is, a, natural, taxonomy, of, the, human, species, because, multiple, other, genetic, patterns, can, be, found, in, human, populations, that, crosscut, racial, distinctions, moreover, the, genomic, data, underdetermines, whether, one, wishes, to, see, subdivisions, i, e, splitters, or, a, continuum, i, e, lumpers, under, kaplan, and, winther, s, view, racial, groupings, are, objective, social, constructions, see, mills, 1998, that, have, conventional, biological, reality, only, insofar, as, the, categories, are, chosen, and, constructed, for, pragmatic, scientific, reasons, in, earlier, work, winther, had, identified, diversity, partitioning, and, clustering, analysis, as, two, separate, methodologies, with, distinct, questions, assumptions, and, protocols, each, is, also, associated, with, opposing, ontological, consequences, vis, a, vis, the, metaphysics, of, race, philosopher, lisa, gannett, has, argued, that, biogeographical, ancestry, a, concept, devised, by, mark, shriver, and, tony, frudakis, is, not, an, objective, measure, of, the, biological, aspects, of, race, as, shriver, and, frudakis, claim, it, is, she, argues, that, it, is, actually, just, a, local, category, shaped, by, the, u, s, context, of, its, production, especially, the, forensic, aim, of, being, able, to, predict, the, race, or, ethnicity, of, an, unknown, suspect, based, on, dna, found, at, the, crime, scene, recent, studies, of, human, genetic, clustering, have, included, a, debate, over, how, genetic, variation, is, organized, with, clusters, and, clines, as, the, main, possible, orderings, serre, p, bo, 2004, argued, for, smooth, clinal, genetic, variation, in, ancestral, populations, even, in, regions, previously, considered, racially, homogeneous, with, the, apparent, gaps, turning, out, to, be, artifacts, of, sampling, techniques, rosenberg, et, al, 2005, disputed, this, and, offered, an, analysis, of, the, human, genetic, diversity, panel, showing, that, there, were, small, discontinuities, in, the, smooth, genetic, variation, for, ancestral, populations, at, the, location, of, geographic, barriers, such, as, the, sahara, the, oceans, and, the, himalayas, nonetheless, rosenberg, et, al, 2005, stated, that, their, findings, should, not, be, taken, as, evidence, of, our, support, of, any, particular, concept, of, biological, race, genetic, differences, among, human, populations, derive, mainly, from, gradations, in, allele, frequencies, rather, than, from, distinctive, diagnostic, genotypes, using, a, sample, of, 40, populations, distributed, roughly, evenly, across, the, earth, s, land, surface, xing, et, al, 2010, p, 208, found, that, genetic, diversity, is, distributed, in, a, more, clinal, pattern, when, more, geographically, intermediate, populations, are, sampled, guido, barbujani, has, written, that, human, genetic, variation, is, generally, distributed, continuously, in, gradients, across, much, of, earth, and, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, genetic, boundaries, between, human, populations, exist, as, would, be, necessary, for, human, races, to, exist, over, time, human, genetic, variation, has, formed, a, nested, structure, that, is, inconsistent, with, the, concept, of, races, that, have, evolved, independently, of, one, another, as, anthropologists, and, other, evolutionary, scientists, have, shifted, away, from, the, language, of, race, to, the, term, population, to, talk, about, genetic, differences, historians, cultural, anthropologists, and, other, social, scientists, re, conceptualized, the, term, race, as, a, cultural, category, or, identity, i, e, a, way, among, many, possible, ways, in, which, a, society, chooses, to, divide, its, members, into, categories, many, social, scientists, have, replaced, the, word, race, with, the, word, ethnicity, to, refer, to, self, identifying, groups, based, on, beliefs, concerning, shared, culture, ancestry, and, history, alongside, empirical, and, conceptual, problems, with, race, following, the, second, world, war, evolutionary, and, social, scientists, were, acutely, aware, of, how, beliefs, about, race, had, been, used, to, justify, discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and, genocide, this, questioning, gained, momentum, in, the, 1960s, during, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, and, the, emergence, of, numerous, anti, colonial, movements, worldwide, they, thus, came, to, believe, that, race, itself, is, a, social, construct, a, concept, that, was, believed, to, correspond, to, an, objective, reality, but, which, was, believed, in, because, of, its, social, functions, craig, venter, and, francis, collins, of, the, national, institute, of, health, jointly, made, the, announcement, of, the, mapping, of, the, human, genome, in, 2000, upon, examining, the, data, from, the, genome, mapping, venter, realized, that, although, the, genetic, variation, within, the, human, species, is, on, the, order, of, 1, 3, instead, of, the, previously, assumed, 1, the, types, of, variations, do, not, support, the, notion, of, genetically, defined, races, venter, said, race, is, a, social, concept, it, s, not, a, scientific, one, there, are, no, bright, lines, that, would, stand, out, if, we, could, compare, all, the, sequenced, genomes, of, everyone, on, the, planet, when, we, try, to, apply, science, to, try, to, sort, out, these, social, differences, it, all, falls, apart, anthropologist, stephan, palmi, has, argued, that, race, is, not, a, thing, but, a, social, relation, or, in, the, words, of, katya, gibel, mevorach, a, metonym, a, human, invention, whose, criteria, for, differentiation, are, neither, universal, nor, fixed, but, have, always, been, used, to, manage, difference, as, such, the, use, of, the, term, race, itself, must, be, analyzed, moreover, they, argue, that, biology, will, not, explain, why, or, how, people, use, the, idea, of, race, only, history, and, social, relationships, will, imani, perry, has, argued, that, race, is, produced, by, social, arrangements, and, political, decision, making, and, that, race, is, something, that, happens, rather, than, something, that, is, it, is, dynamic, but, it, holds, no, objective, truth, similarly, in, racial, culture, a, critique, 2005, richard, t, ford, argued, that, while, there, is, no, necessary, correspondence, between, the, ascribed, identity, of, race, and, one, s, culture, or, personal, sense, of, self, and, group, difference, is, not, intrinsic, to, members, of, social, groups, but, rather, contingent, o, the, social, practices, of, group, identification, the, social, practices, of, identity, politics, may, coerce, individuals, into, the, compulsory, enactment, of, prewritten, racial, scripts, compared, to, 19th, century, united, states, 20th, century, brazil, was, characterized, by, a, perceived, relative, absence, of, sharply, defined, racial, groups, according, to, anthropologist, marvin, harris, this, pattern, reflects, a, different, history, and, different, social, relations, race, in, brazil, was, biologized, but, in, a, way, that, recognized, the, difference, between, ancestry, which, determines, genotype, and, phenotypic, differences, there, racial, identity, was, not, governed, by, rigid, descent, rule, such, as, the, one, drop, rule, as, it, was, in, the, united, states, a, brazilian, child, was, never, automatically, identified, with, the, racial, type, of, one, or, both, parents, nor, were, there, only, a, very, limited, number, of, categories, to, choose, from, to, the, extent, that, full, siblings, can, pertain, to, different, racial, groups, over, a, dozen, racial, categories, would, be, recognized, in, conformity, with, all, the, possible, combinations, of, hair, color, hair, texture, eye, color, and, skin, color, these, types, grade, into, each, other, like, the, colors, of, the, spectrum, and, not, one, category, stands, significantly, isolated, from, the, rest, that, is, race, referred, preferentially, to, appearance, not, heredity, and, appearance, is, a, poor, indication, of, ancestry, because, only, a, few, genes, are, responsible, for, someone, s, skin, color, and, traits, a, person, who, is, considered, white, may, have, more, african, ancestry, than, a, person, who, is, considered, black, and, the, reverse, can, be, also, true, about, european, ancestry, the, complexity, of, racial, classifications, in, brazil, reflects, the, extent, of, genetic, mixing, in, brazilian, society, a, society, that, remains, highly, but, not, strictly, stratified, along, color, lines, these, socioeconomic, factors, are, also, significant, to, the, limits, of, racial, lines, because, a, minority, of, pardos, or, brown, people, are, likely, to, start, declaring, themselves, white, or, black, if, socially, upward, and, being, seen, as, relatively, whiter, as, their, perceived, social, status, increases, much, as, in, other, regions, of, latin, america, fluidity, of, racial, categories, aside, the, biologification, of, race, in, brazil, referred, above, would, match, contemporary, concepts, of, race, in, the, united, states, quite, closely, though, if, brazilians, are, supposed, to, choose, their, race, as, one, among, asian, and, indigenous, apart, three, ibge, s, census, categories, while, assimilated, amerindians, and, people, with, very, high, quantities, of, amerindian, ancestry, are, usually, grouped, as, caboclos, a, subgroup, of, pardos, which, roughly, translates, as, both, mestizo, and, hillbilly, for, those, of, lower, quantity, of, amerindian, descent, a, higher, european, genetic, contribution, is, expected, to, be, grouped, as, a, pardo, in, several, genetic, tests, people, with, less, than, 60, 65, of, european, descent, and, 5, 10, of, amerindian, descent, usually, cluster, with, afro, brazilians, as, reported, by, the, individuals, or, 6, 9, of, the, population, and, those, with, about, 45, or, more, of, subsaharan, contribution, most, times, do, so, in, average, afro, brazilian, dna, was, reported, to, be, about, 50, subsaharan, african, 37, european, and, 13, amerindian, if, a, more, consistent, report, with, the, genetic, groups, in, the, gradation, of, genetic, mixing, is, to, be, considered, e, g, that, would, not, cluster, people, with, a, balanced, degree, of, african, and, non, african, ancestry, in, the, black, group, instead, of, the, multiracial, one, unlike, elsewhere, in, latin, america, where, people, of, high, quantity, of, african, descent, tend, to, classify, themselves, as, mixed, more, people, would, report, themselves, as, white, and, pardo, in, brazil, 47, 7, and, 42, 4, of, the, population, as, of, 2010, respectively, because, by, research, its, population, is, believed, to, have, between, 65, and, 80, of, autosomal, european, ancestry, in, average, also, 35, of, european, mt, dna, and, 95, of, european, y, dna, from, the, last, decades, of, the, empire, until, the, 1950s, the, proportion, of, the, white, population, increased, significantly, while, brazil, welcomed, 5, 5, million, immigrants, between, 1821, and, 1932, not, much, behind, its, neighbor, argentina, with, 6, 4, million, and, it, received, more, european, immigrants, in, its, colonial, history, than, the, united, states, between, 1500, and, 1760, 700, 000, europeans, settled, in, brazil, while, 530, 000, europeans, settled, in, the, united, states, for, the, same, given, time, thus, the, historical, construction, of, race, in, brazilian, society, dealt, primarily, with, gradations, between, persons, of, majority, european, ancestry, and, little, minority, groups, with, otherwise, lower, quantity, therefrom, in, recent, times, according, to, the, council, of, the, european, union, the, european, union, rejects, theories, which, attempt, to, determine, the, existence, of, separate, human, races, the, european, union, uses, the, terms, racial, origin, and, ethnic, origin, synonymously, in, its, documents, and, according, to, it, the, use, of, the, term, racial, origin, in, this, directive, does, not, imply, an, acceptance, of, such, theories, haney, l, pez, warns, that, using, race, as, a, category, within, the, law, tends, to, legitimize, its, existence, in, the, popular, imagination, in, the, diverse, geographic, context, of, europe, ethnicity, and, ethnic, origin, are, arguably, more, resonant, and, are, less, encumbered, by, the, ideological, baggage, associated, with, race, in, european, context, historical, resonance, of, race, underscores, its, problematic, nature, in, some, states, it, is, strongly, associated, with, laws, promulgated, by, the, nazi, and, fascist, governments, in, europe, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, indeed, in, 1996, the, european, parliament, adopted, a, resolution, stating, that, the, term, should, therefore, be, avoided, in, all, official, texts, the, concept, of, racial, origin, relies, on, the, notion, that, human, beings, can, be, separated, into, biologically, distinct, races, an, idea, generally, rejected, by, the, scientific, community, since, all, human, beings, belong, to, the, same, species, the, ecri, european, commission, against, racism, and, intolerance, rejects, theories, based, on, the, existence, of, different, races, however, in, its, recommendation, ecri, uses, this, term, in, order, to, ensure, that, those, persons, who, are, generally, and, erroneously, perceived, as, belonging, to, another, race, are, not, excluded, from, the, protection, provided, for, by, the, legislation, the, law, claims, to, reject, the, existence, of, race, yet, penalize, situations, where, someone, is, treated, less, favourably, on, this, ground, the, immigrants, to, the, united, states, came, from, every, region, of, europe, africa, and, asia, they, mixed, among, themselves, and, with, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, the, continent, in, the, united, states, most, people, who, self, identify, as, african, american, have, some, european, ancestors, while, many, people, who, identify, as, european, american, have, some, african, or, amerindian, ancestors, since, the, early, history, of, the, united, states, amerindians, african, americans, and, european, americans, have, been, classified, as, belonging, to, different, races, efforts, to, track, mixing, between, groups, led, to, a, proliferation, of, categories, such, as, mulatto, and, octoroon, the, criteria, for, membership, in, these, races, diverged, in, the, late, 19th, century, during, the, reconstruction, era, increasing, numbers, of, americans, began, to, consider, anyone, with, one, drop, of, known, black, blood, to, be, black, regardless, of, appearance, by, the, early, 20th, century, this, notion, was, made, statutory, in, many, states, amerindians, continue, to, be, defined, by, a, certain, percentage, of, indian, blood, called, blood, quantum, to, be, white, one, had, to, have, perceived, pure, white, ancestry, the, one, drop, rule, or, hypodescent, rule, refers, to, the, convention, of, defining, a, person, as, racially, black, if, he, or, she, has, any, known, african, ancestry, this, rule, meant, that, those, that, were, mixed, race, but, with, some, discernible, african, ancestry, were, defined, as, black, the, one, drop, rule, is, specific, to, not, only, those, with, african, ancestry, but, to, the, united, states, making, it, a, particularly, african, american, experience, the, decennial, censuses, conducted, since, 1790, in, the, united, states, created, an, incentive, to, establish, racial, categories, and, fit, people, into, these, categories, the, term, hispanic, as, an, ethnonym, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, with, the, rise, of, migration, of, laborers, from, the, spanish, speaking, countries, of, latin, america, to, the, united, states, today, the, word, latino, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, hispanic, the, definitions, of, both, terms, are, non, race, specific, and, include, people, who, consider, themselves, to, be, of, distinct, races, black, white, amerindian, asian, and, mixed, groups, however, there, is, a, common, misconception, in, the, us, that, hispanic, latino, is, a, race, or, sometimes, even, that, national, origins, such, as, mexican, cuban, colombian, salvadoran, etc, are, races, in, contrast, to, latino, or, hispanic, anglo, refers, to, non, hispanic, white, americans, or, non, hispanic, european, americans, most, of, whom, speak, the, english, language, but, are, not, necessarily, of, english, descent, the, concept, of, race, classification, in, physical, anthropology, lost, credibility, around, the, 1960s, and, is, now, considered, untenable, a, 2019, statement, by, the, american, association, of, physical, anthropologists, declares, race, does, not, provide, an, accurate, representation, of, human, biological, variation, it, was, never, accurate, in, the, past, and, it, remains, inaccurate, when, referencing, contemporary, human, populations, humans, are, not, divided, biologically, into, distinct, continental, types, or, racial, genetic, clusters, instead, the, western, concept, of, race, must, be, understood, as, a, classification, system, that, emerged, from, and, in, support, of, european, colonialism, oppression, and, discrimination, wagner, et, al, 2017, surveyed, 3, 286, american, anthropologists, views, on, race, and, genetics, including, both, cultural, and, biological, anthropologists, they, found, a, consensus, among, them, that, biological, races, do, not, exist, in, humans, but, that, race, does, exist, insofar, as, the, social, experiences, of, members, of, different, races, can, have, significant, effects, on, health, wang, trkalj, et, al, 2003, examined, the, use, of, race, as, a, biological, concept, in, research, papers, published, in, china, s, only, biological, anthropology, journal, acta, anthropologica, sinica, the, study, showed, that, the, race, concept, was, widely, used, among, chinese, anthropologists, in, a, 2007, review, paper, trkalj, suggested, that, the, stark, contrast, of, the, racial, approach, between, the, united, states, and, china, was, due, to, the, fact, that, race, is, a, factor, for, social, cohesion, among, the, ethnically, diverse, people, of, china, whereas, race, is, a, very, sensitive, issue, in, america, and, the, racial, approach, is, considered, to, undermine, social, cohesion, with, the, result, that, in, the, socio, political, context, of, us, academics, scientists, are, encouraged, not, to, use, racial, categories, whereas, in, china, they, are, encouraged, to, use, them, lieberman, et, al, in, a, 2004, study, researched, the, acceptance, of, race, as, a, concept, among, anthropologists, in, the, united, states, canada, the, spanish, speaking, areas, europe, russia, and, china, rejection, of, race, ranged, from, high, to, low, with, the, highest, rejection, rate, in, the, united, states, and, canada, a, moderate, rejection, rate, in, europe, and, the, lowest, rejection, rate, in, russia, and, china, methods, used, in, the, studies, reported, included, questionnaires, and, content, analysis, kaszycka, et, al, 2009, in, 2002, 2003, surveyed, european, anthropologists, opinions, toward, the, biological, race, concept, three, factors, country, of, academic, education, discipline, and, age, were, found, to, be, significant, in, differentiating, the, replies, those, educated, in, western, europe, physical, anthropologists, and, middle, aged, persons, rejected, race, more, frequently, than, those, educated, in, eastern, europe, people, in, other, branches, of, science, and, those, from, both, younger, and, older, generations, the, survey, shows, that, the, views, on, race, are, sociopolitically, ideologically, influenced, and, highly, dependent, on, education, since, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, physical, anthropology, in, the, united, states, has, moved, away, from, a, typological, understanding, of, human, biological, diversity, towards, a, genomic, and, population, based, perspective, anthropologists, have, tended, to, understand, race, as, a, social, classification, of, humans, based, on, phenotype, and, ancestry, as, well, as, cultural, factors, as, the, concept, is, understood, in, the, social, sciences, since, 1932, an, increasing, number, of, college, textbooks, introducing, physical, anthropology, have, rejected, race, as, a, valid, concept, from, 1932, to, 1976, only, seven, out, of, thirty, two, rejected, race, from, 1975, to, 1984, thirteen, out, of, thirty, three, rejected, race, from, 1985, to, 1993, thirteen, out, of, nineteen, rejected, race, according, to, one, academic, journal, entry, where, 78, percent, of, the, articles, in, the, 1931, journal, of, physical, anthropology, employed, these, or, nearly, synonymous, terms, reflecting, a, bio, race, paradigm, only, 36, percent, did, so, in, 1965, and, just, 28, percent, did, in, 1996, a, 1998, statement, on, race, composed, by, a, select, committee, of, anthropologists, and, issued, by, the, executive, board, of, the, american, anthropological, association, which, they, argue, represents, generally, the, contemporary, thinking, and, scholarly, positions, of, a, majority, of, anthropologists, declares, in, the, united, states, both, scholars, and, the, general, public, have, been, conditioned, to, viewing, human, races, as, natural, and, separate, divisions, within, the, human, species, based, on, visible, physical, differences, with, the, vast, expansion, of, scientific, knowledge, in, this, century, however, it, has, become, clear, that, human, populations, are, not, unambiguous, clearly, demarcated, biologically, distinct, groups, evidence, from, the, analysis, of, genetics, e, g, dna, indicates, that, most, physical, variation, about, 94, lies, within, so, called, racial, groups, conventional, geographic, racial, groupings, differ, from, one, another, only, in, about, 6, of, their, genes, this, means, that, there, is, greater, variation, within, racial, groups, than, between, them, in, neighboring, populations, there, is, much, overlapping, of, genes, and, their, phenotypic, physical, expressions, throughout, history, whenever, different, groups, have, come, into, contact, they, have, interbred, the, continued, sharing, of, genetic, materials, has, maintained, all, of, humankind, as, a, single, species, with, the, vast, expansion, of, scientific, knowledge, in, this, century, it, has, become, clear, that, human, populations, are, not, unambiguous, clearly, demarcated, biologically, distinct, groups, given, what, we, know, about, the, capacity, of, normal, humans, to, achieve, and, function, within, any, culture, we, conclude, that, present, day, inequalities, between, so, called, racial, groups, are, not, consequences, of, their, biological, inheritance, but, products, of, historical, and, contemporary, social, economic, educational, and, political, circumstances, an, earlier, survey, conducted, in, 1985, lieberman, et, al, 1992, asked, 1, 200, american, scientists, how, many, disagree, with, the, following, proposition, there, are, biological, races, in, the, species, homo, sapiens, among, anthropologists, the, responses, were, lieberman, s, study, also, showed, that, more, women, reject, the, concept, of, race, than, men, the, same, survey, conducted, again, in, 1999, showed, that, the, number, of, anthropologists, disagreeing, with, the, idea, of, biological, race, had, risen, substantially, the, results, were, as, follows, a, line, of, research, conducted, by, cartmill, 1998, however, seemed, to, limit, the, scope, of, lieberman, s, finding, that, there, was, a, significant, degree, of, change, in, the, status, of, the, race, concept, goran, trkalj, has, argued, that, this, may, be, because, lieberman, and, collaborators, had, looked, at, all, the, members, of, the, american, anthropological, association, irrespective, of, their, field, of, research, interest, while, cartmill, had, looked, specifically, at, biological, anthropologists, interested, in, human, variation, in, 2007, ann, morning, interviewed, over, 40, american, biologists, and, anthropologists, and, found, significant, disagreements, over, the, nature, of, race, with, no, one, viewpoint, holding, a, majority, among, either, group, morning, also, argues, that, a, third, position, antiessentialism, which, holds, that, race, is, not, a, useful, concept, for, biologists, should, be, introduced, into, this, debate, in, addition, to, constructionism, and, essentialism, according, to, the, 2000, university, of, wyoming, edition, of, a, popular, physical, anthropology, textbook, forensic, anthropologists, are, overwhelmingly, in, support, of, the, idea, of, the, basic, biological, reality, of, human, races, forensic, physical, anthropologist, and, professor, george, w, gill, has, said, that, the, idea, that, race, is, only, skin, deep, is, simply, not, true, as, any, experienced, forensic, anthropologist, will, affirm, and, many, morphological, features, tend, to, follow, geographic, boundaries, coinciding, often, with, climatic, zones, this, is, not, surprising, since, the, selective, forces, of, climate, are, probably, the, primary, forces, of, nature, that, have, shaped, human, races, with, regard, not, only, to, skin, color, and, hair, form, but, also, the, underlying, bony, structures, of, the, nose, cheekbones, etc, for, example, more, prominent, noses, humidify, air, better, while, he, can, see, good, arguments, for, both, sides, the, complete, denial, of, the, opposing, evidence, seems, to, stem, largely, from, socio, political, motivation, and, not, science, at, all, he, also, states, that, many, biological, anthropologists, see, races, as, real, yet, not, one, introductory, textbook, of, physical, anthropology, even, presents, that, perspective, as, a, possibility, in, a, case, as, flagrant, as, this, we, are, not, dealing, with, science, but, rather, with, blatant, politically, motivated, censorship, in, partial, response, to, gill, s, statement, professor, of, biological, anthropology, c, loring, brace, argues, that, the, reason, laymen, and, biological, anthropologists, can, determine, the, geographic, ancestry, of, an, individual, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, biological, characteristics, are, clinally, distributed, across, the, planet, and, that, does, not, translate, into, the, concept, of, race, he, states, well, you, may, ask, why, can, t, we, call, those, regional, patterns, races, in, fact, we, can, and, do, but, it, does, not, make, them, coherent, biological, entities, races, defined, in, such, a, way, are, products, of, our, perceptions, we, realize, that, in, the, extremes, of, our, transit, moscow, to, nairobi, perhaps, there, is, a, major, but, gradual, change, in, skin, color, from, what, we, euphemistically, call, white, to, black, and, that, this, is, related, to, the, latitudinal, difference, in, the, intensity, of, the, ultraviolet, component, of, sunlight, what, we, do, not, see, however, is, the, myriad, other, traits, that, are, distributed, in, a, fashion, quite, unrelated, to, the, intensity, of, ultraviolet, radiation, where, skin, color, is, concerned, all, the, northern, populations, of, the, old, world, are, lighter, than, the, long, term, inhabitants, near, the, equator, although, europeans, and, chinese, are, obviously, different, in, skin, color, they, are, closer, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, equatorial, africans, but, if, we, test, the, distribution, of, the, widely, known, abo, blood, group, system, then, europeans, and, africans, are, closer, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, chinese, the, concept, of, race, is, still, sometimes, used, within, forensic, anthropology, when, analyzing, skeletal, remains, biomedical, research, and, race, based, medicine, brace, has, criticized, forensic, anthropologists, for, this, arguing, that, they, in, fact, should, be, talking, about, regional, ancestry, he, argues, that, while, forensic, anthropologists, can, determine, that, a, skeletal, remain, comes, from, a, person, with, ancestors, in, a, specific, region, of, africa, categorizing, that, skeletal, as, being, black, is, a, socially, constructed, category, that, is, only, meaningful, in, the, particular, social, context, of, the, united, states, and, which, is, not, itself, scientifically, valid, in, the, same, 1985, survey, lieberman, et, al, 1992, 16, of, the, surveyed, biologists, and, 36, of, the, surveyed, developmental, psychologists, disagreed, with, the, proposition, there, are, biological, races, in, the, species, homo, sapiens, the, authors, of, the, study, also, examined, 77, college, textbooks, in, biology, and, 69, in, physical, anthropology, published, between, 1932, and, 1989, physical, anthropology, texts, argued, that, biological, races, exist, until, the, 1970s, when, they, began, to, argue, that, races, do, not, exist, in, contrast, biology, textbooks, did, not, undergo, such, a, reversal, but, many, instead, dropped, their, discussion, of, race, altogether, the, authors, attributed, this, to, biologists, trying, to, avoid, discussing, the, political, implications, of, racial, classifications, and, to, the, ongoing, discussions, in, biology, about, the, validity, of, the, idea, of, subspecies, the, authors, concluded, the, concept, of, race, masking, the, overwhelming, genetic, similarity, of, all, peoples, and, the, mosaic, patterns, of, variation, that, do, not, correspond, to, racial, divisions, is, not, only, socially, dysfunctional, but, is, biologically, indefensible, as, well, pp, 5, 18, 5, 19, lieberman, et, al, 1992, pp, 316, 17, a, 1994, examination, of, 32, english, sport, exercise, science, textbooks, found, that, 7, 21, 9, claimed, that, there, are, biophysical, differences, due, to, race, that, might, explain, differences,

adolescent, medicine, asked, authors, to, not, use, race, and, ethnicity, when, there, is, no, biological, scientific, or, sociological, reason, for, doing, so, the, editors, also, stated, that, analysis, by, race, and, ethnicity, has, become, an, analytical, knee, jerk, reflex, nature, genetics, now, ask, authors, to, explain, why, they, make, use, of, particular, ethnic, groups, or, populations, and, how, classification, was, achieved, morning, 2008, looked, at, high, school, biology, textbooks, during, the, 1952, 2002, period, and, initially, found, a, similar, pattern, with, only, 35, directly, discussing, race, in, the, 1983, 92, period, from, initially, 92, doing, so, however, this, has, increased, somewhat, after, this, to, 43, more, indirect, and, brief, discussions, of, race, in, the, context, of, medical, disorders, have, increased, from, none, to, 93, of, textbooks, in, general, the, material, on, race, has, moved, from, surface, traits, to, genetics, and,

community, in, 2008, morning, concluded, that, biologists, had, failed, to, come, to, a, clear, consensus, and, they, often, split, along, cultural, and, demographic, lines, she, notes, at, best, one, can, conclude, that, biologists, and, anthropologists, now, appear, equally, divided, in, their, beliefs, about, the, nature, of, race, gissis, 2008, examined, several, important, american, and, british, journals, in, genetics, epidemiology, and, medicine, for, their, content, during, the, 1946, 2003, period, he, wrote, that, based, upon, my, findings, i, argue, that, the, category, of, race, only, seemingly, disappeared, from, scientific, discourse, after, world, war, ii, and, has, had, a, fluctuating, yet, continuous, use, during, the, time, span, from, 1946, to, 2003, and, has, even, become, more, pronounced, from, the, early, 1970s, on, 33, health, services, researchers, from, differing, geographic, regions, were, interviewed, in, a, 2008, study, the, researchers, recognized, the, problems, with, racial, and, ethnic, variables, but, the, majority, still, believed, these, variables, were, necessary, and, useful, a, 2010, examination, of, 18, widely, used, english, anatomy, textbooks, found, that, they, all, represented, human, biological, variation, in, superficial, and, outdated, ways, many, of, them, making, use, of, the, race, concept, in, ways, that, were, current, in, 1950s, anthropology, the, authors, recommended, that, anatomical, education, should, describe, human, anatomical, variation, in, more, detail, and, rely, on, newer, research, that, demonstrates, the, inadequacies, of, simple, racial, typologies, a, 2021, study, that, examined, over, 11, 000, papers, from, 1949, to, 2018, in, the, american, journal, of, human, genetics, found, that, race, was, used, in, only, 5, of, papers, published, in, the, last, decade, down, from, 22, in, the, first, together, with, an, increase, in, use, of, the, terms, ethnicity, ancestry, and, location, based, terms, it, suggests, that, human, geneticists, have, mostly, abandoned, the, term, race, the, national, academies, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, nasem, supported, by, the, us, the, national, institutes, of, health, formally, declared, that, researchers, should, not, use, race, as, a, proxy, for, describing, human, genetic, variation, the, report, of, its, committee, on, the, use, of, race, ethnicity, and, ancestry, as, population, descriptors, in, genomics, research, titled, using, population, descriptors, in, genetics, and, genomics, research, was, released, on, 14, march, 2023, the, report, stated, in, humans, race, is, a, socially, constructed, designation, a, misleading, and, harmful, surrogate, for, population, genetic, differences, and, has, a, long, history, of, being, incorrectly, identified, as, the, major, genetic, reason, for, phenotypic, differences, between, groups, the, committee, co, chair, charmaine, d, royal, and, robert, o, keohane, of, duke, university, agreed, in, the, meeting, classifying, people, by, race, is, a, practice, entangled, with, and, rooted, in, racism, lester, frank, ward, 1841, 1913, considered, to, be, one, of, the, founders, of, american, sociology, rejected, notions, that, there, were, fundamental, differences, that, distinguished, one, race, from, another, although, he, acknowledged, that, social, conditions, differed, dramatically, by, race, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, sociologists, viewed, the, concept, of, race, in, ways, that, were, shaped, by, the, scientific, racism, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, many, sociologists, focused, on, african, americans, called, negroes, at, that, time, and, claimed, that, they, were, inferior, to, whites, white, sociologist, charlotte, perkins, gilman, 1860, 1935, for, example, used, biological, arguments, to, claim, the, inferiority, of, african, americans, american, sociologist, charles, h, cooley, 1864, 1929, theorized, that, differences, among, races, were, natural, and, that, biological, differences, result, in, differences, in, intellectual, abilities, edward, alsworth, ross, 1866, 1951, also, an, important, figure, in, the, founding, of, american, sociology, and, a, eugenicist, believed, that, whites, were, the, superior, race, and, that, there, were, essential, differences, in, temperament, among, races, in, 1910, the, journal, published, an, article, by, ulysses, g, weatherly, 1865, 1940, that, called, for, white, supremacy, and, segregation, of, the, races, to, protect, racial, purity, w, e, b, du, bois, 1868, 1963, one, of, the, first, african, american, sociologists, was, the, first, sociologist, to, use, sociological, concepts, and, empirical, research, methods, to, analyze, race, as, a, social, construct, instead, of, a, biological, reality, beginning, in, 1899, with, his, book, the, philadelphia, negro, du, bois, studied, and, wrote, about, race, and, racism, throughout, his, career, in, his, work, he, contended, that, social, class, colonialism, and, capitalism, shaped, ideas, about, race, and, racial, categories, social, scientists, largely, abandoned, scientific, racism, and, biological, reasons, for, racial, categorization, schemes, by, the, 1930s, other, early, sociologists, especially, those, associated, with, the, chicago, school, joined, du, bois, in, theorizing, race, as, a, socially, constructed, fact, by, 1978, william, julius, wilson, argued, that, race, and, racial, classification, systems, were, declining, in, significance, and, that, instead, social, class, more, accurately, described, what, sociologists, had, earlier, understood, as, race, by, 1986, sociologists, michael, omi, and, howard, winant, successfully, introduced, the, concept, of, racial, formation, to, describe, the, process, by, which, racial, categories, are, created, omi, and, winant, assert, that, there, is, no, biological, basis, for, distinguishing, among, human, groups, along, the, lines, of, race, eduardo, bonilla, silva, sociology, professor, at, duke, university, remarks, i, contend, that, racism, is, more, than, anything, else, a, matter, of, group, power, it, is, about, a, dominant, racial, group, whites, striving, to, maintain, its, systemic, advantages, and, minorities, fighting, to, subvert, the, racial, status, quo, the, types, of, practices, that, take, place, under, this, new, color, blind, racism, is, subtle, institutionalized, and, supposedly, not, racial, color, blind, racism, thrives, on, the, idea, that, race, is, no, longer, an, issue, in, the, united, states, there, are, contradictions, between, the, alleged, color, blindness, of, most, whites, and, the, persistence, of, a, color, coded, system, of, inequality, today, sociologists, generally, understand, race, and, racial, categories, as, socially, constructed, and, reject, racial, categorization, schemes, that, depend, on, biological, differences, in, the, united, states, federal, government, policy, promotes, the, use, of, racially, categorized, data, to, identify, and, address, health, disparities, between, racial, or, ethnic, groups, in, clinical, settings, race, has, sometimes, been, considered, in, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, medical, conditions, doctors, have, noted, that, some, medical, conditions, are, more, prevalent, in, certain, racial, or, ethnic, groups, than, in, others, without, being, sure, of, the, cause, of, those, differences, recent, interest, in, race, based, medicine, or, race, targeted, pharmacogenomics, has, been, fueled, by, the, proliferation, of, human, genetic, data, which, followed, the, decoding, of, the, human, genome, in, the, first, decade, of, the, twenty, first, century, there, is, an, active, debate, among, biomedical, researchers, about, the, meaning, and, importance, of, race, in, their, research, proponents, of, the, use, of, racial, categories, in, biomedicine, argue, that, continued, use, of, racial, categorizations, in, biomedical, research, and, clinical, practice, makes, possible, the, application, of, new, genetic, findings, and, provides, a, clue, to, diagnosis, biomedical, researchers, positions, on, race, fall, into, two, main, camps, those, who, consider, the, concept, of, race, to, have, no, biological, basis, and, those, who, consider, it, to, have, the, potential, to, be, biologically, meaningful, members, of, the, latter, camp, often, base, their, arguments, around, the, potential, to, create, genome, based, personalized, medicine, other, researchers, point, out, that, finding, a, difference, in, disease, prevalence, between, two, socially, defined, groups, does, not, necessarily, imply, genetic, causation, of, the, difference, they, suggest, that, medical, practices, should, maintain, their, focus, on, the, individual, rather, than, an, individual, s, membership, to, any, group, they, argue, that, overemphasizing, genetic, contributions, to, health, disparities, carries, various, risks, such, as, reinforcing, stereotypes, promoting, racism, or, ignoring, the, contribution, of, non, genetic, factors, to, health, disparities, international, epidemiological, data, show, that, living, conditions, rather, than, race, make, the, biggest, difference, in, health, outcomes, even, for, diseases, that, have, race, specific, treatments, some, studies, have, found, that, patients, are, reluctant, to, accept, racial, categorization, in, medical, practice, in, an, attempt, to, provide, general, descriptions, that, may, facilitate, the, job, of, law, enforcement, officers, seeking, to, apprehend, suspects, the, united, states, fbi, employs, the, term, race, to, summarize, the, general, appearance, skin, color, hair, texture, eye, shape, and, other, such, easily, noticed, characteristics, of, individuals, whom, they, are, attempting, to, apprehend, from, the, perspective, of, law, enforcement, officers, it, is, generally, more, important, to, arrive, at, a, description, that, will, readily, suggest, the, general, appearance, of, an, individual, than, to, make, a, scientifically, valid, categorization, by, dna, or, other, such, means, thus, in, addition, to, assigning, a, wanted, individual, to, a, racial, category, such, a, description, will, include, height, weight, eye, color, scars, and, other, distinguishing, characteristics, criminal, justice, agencies, in, england, and, wales, use, at, least, two, separate, racial, ethnic, classification, systems, when, reporting, crime, as, of, 2010, one, is, the,

france, the, state, is, legally, banned, from, maintaining, data, based, on, race, in, the, united, states, the, practice, of, racial, profiling, has, been, ruled, to, be, both, unconstitutional, and, a, violation, of, civil, rights, there, is, active, debate, regarding, the, cause, of, a, marked, correlation, between, the, recorded, crimes, punishments, meted, out, and, the, country, s, populations, many, consider, de, facto, racial, profiling, an, example, of, institutional, racism, in, law, enforcement, mass, incarceration, in, the, united, states, disproportionately, impacts, african, american, and, latino, communities, michelle, alexander, author, of, the, new, jim, crow, mass, incarceration, in, the, age, of, colorblindness, 2010, argues, that, mass, incarceration, is, best, understood, as, not, only, a, system, of, overcrowded, prisons, mass, incarceration, is, also, the, larger, web, of, laws, rules, policies, and, customs, that, control, those, labeled, criminals, both, in, and, out, of, prison, she, defines, it, further, as, a, system, that, locks, people, not, only, behind, actual, bars, in, actual, prisons, but, also, behind, virtual, bars, and, virtual, walls, illustrating, the, second, class, citizenship, that, is, imposed, on, a, disproportionate, number, of, people, of, color, specifically, african, americans, she, compares, mass, incarceration, to, jim, crow, laws, stating, that, both, work, as, racial, caste, systems, many, research, findings, appear, to, agree, that, the, impact, of, victim, race, in, the, interpersonal, violence, ipv, arrest, decision, might, include, a, racial, bias, in, favor, of, white, victims, a, 2011, study, in, a, national, sample, of, ipv, arrests, found, that, female, arrest, was, more, likely, if, the, male, victim, was, white, and, the, female, offender, was, black, while, male, arrest, was, more, likely, if, the, female, victim, was, white, for, both, female, and, male, arrest, in, ipv, cases, situations, involving, married, couples, were, more, likely, to, lead, to, arrest, compared, to, dating, or, divorced, couples, more, research, is, needed, to, understand, agency, and, community, factors, that, influence, police, behavior, and, how, discrepancies, in, ipv, interventions, tools, of, justice, can, be, addressed, recent, work, using, dna, cluster, analysis, to, determine, race, background, has, been, used, by, some, criminal, investigators, to, narrow, their, search, for, the, identity, of, both, suspects, and, victims, proponents, of, dna, profiling, in, criminal, investigations, cite, cases, where, leads, based, on, dna, analysis, proved, useful, but, the, practice, remains, controversial, among, medical, ethicists, defense, lawyers, and, some, in, law, enforcement, the, constitution, of, australia, contains, a, line, about, people, of, any, race, for, whom, it, is, deemed, necessary, to, make, special, laws, despite, there, being, no, agreed, definition, of, race, described, in, the, document, similarly, forensic, anthropologists, draw, on, highly, heritable, morphological, features, of, human, remains, e, g, cranial, measurements, to, aid, in, the, identification, of, the, body, including, in, terms, of, race, in, a, 1992, article, anthropologist, norman, sauer, noted, that, anthropologists, had, generally, abandoned, the, concept, of, race, as, a, valid, representation, of, human, biological, diversity, except, for, forensic, anthropologists, he, asked, if, races, don, t, exist, why, are, forensic, anthropologists, so, good, at, identifying, them, he, concluded, he, successful, assignment, of, race, to, a, skeletal, specimen, is, not, a, vindication, of, the, race, concept, but, rather, a, prediction, that, an, individual, while, alive, was, assigned, to, a, particular, socially, constructed, racial, category, a, specimen, may, display, features, that, point, to, african, ancestry, in, this, country, that, person, is, likely, to, have, been, labeled, black, regardless, of, whether, or, not, such, a, race, actually, exists, in, nature, identification, of, the, ancestry, of, an, individual, is, dependent, upon, knowledge, of, the, frequency, and, distribution, of, phenotypic, traits, in, a, population, this, does, not, necessitate, the, use, of, a, racial, classification, scheme, based, on, unrelated, traits, although, the, race, concept, is, widely, used, in, medical, and, legal, contexts, in, the, united, states, some, studies, have, reported, that, races, can, be, identified, with, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, using, certain, methods, such, as, that, developed, by, giles, and, elliot, however, this, method, sometimes, fails, to, be, replicated, in, other, times, and, places, for, instance, when, the, method, was, re, tested, to, identify, native, americans, the, average, rate, of, accuracy, dropped, from, 85, to, 33, prior, information, about, the, individual, e, g, census, data, is, also, important, in, allowing, the, accurate, identification, of, the, individual, s, race, in, a, different, approach, anthropologist, c, loring, brace, said, the, simple, answer, is, that, as, members, of, the, society, that, poses, the, question, they, are, inculcated, into, the, social, conventions, that, determine, the, expected, answer, they, should, also, be, aware, of, the, biological, inaccuracies, contained, in, that, politically, correct, answer, skeletal, analysis, provides, no, direct, assessment, of, skin, color, but, it, does, allow, an, accurate, estimate, of, original, geographical, origins, african, eastern, asian, and, european, ancestry, can, be, specified, with, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, africa, of, course, entails, black, but, black, does, not, entail, african, in, association, with, a, nova, program, in, 2000, about, race, he, wrote, an, essay, opposing, use, of, the, term, a, 2002, study, found, that, about, 13, of, human, craniometric, variation, existed, between, regions, while, 6, existed, between, local, populations, within, regions, and, 81, within, local, populations, in, contrast, the, opposite, pattern, of, genetic, variation, was, observed, for, skin, color, which, is, often, used, to, define, race, with, 88, of, variation, between, regions, the, study, concluded, the, apportionment, of, genetic, diversity, in, skin, color, is, atypical, and, cannot, be, used, for, purposes, of, classification, similarly, a, 2009, study, found, that, craniometrics, could, be, used, accurately, to, determine, what, part, of, the, world, someone, was, from, based, on, their, cranium, however, this, study, also, found, that, there, were, no, abrupt, boundaries, that, separated, craniometric, variation, into, distinct, racial, groups, another, 2009, study, showed, that, american, blacks, and, whites, had, different, skeletal, morphologies, and, that, significant, patterning, in, variation, in, these, traits, exists, within, continents, this, suggests, that, classifying, humans, into, races, based, on, skeletal, characteristics, would, necessitate, many, different, races, being, defined, in, 2010, philosopher, neven, sesardi, argued, that, when, several, traits, are, analyzed, at, the, same, time, forensic, anthropologists, can, classify, a, person, s, race, with, an, accuracy, of, close, to, 100, based, on, only, skeletal, remains, sesardi, s, claim, has, been, disputed, by, philosopher, massimo, pigliucci, who, accused, sesardi, of, cherry, pick, the, scientific, evidence, and, reach, conclusions, that, are, contradicted, by, it, specifically, pigliucci, argued, that, sesardi, misrepresented, a, paper, by, ousley, et, al, 2009, and, neglected, to, mention, that, they, identified, differentiation, not, just, between, individuals, from, different, races, but, also, between, individuals, from, different, tribes, local, environments, and, time, periods
