imperialism, is, the, practice, theory, or, attitude, of, maintaining, or, extending, power, over, foreign, nations, particularly, through, expansionism, employing, both, hard, power, military, and, economic, power, and, soft, power, diplomatic, power, and, cultural, imperialism, imperialism, focuses, on, establishing, or, maintaining, hegemony, and, a, more, or, less, formal, empire, while, related, to, the, concepts, of, colonialism, imperialism, is, a, distinct, concept, that, can, apply, to, other, forms, of, expansion, and, many, forms, of, government, the, word, imperialism, originated, from, the, latin, word, imperium, which, means, to, command, to, be, sovereign, or, simply, to, rule, the, word, imperialism, was, first, produced, in, the, 19th, century, to, decry, napoleon, iii, s, despotic, militarism, and, his, attempts, at, obtaining, political, support, through, foreign, military, interventions, the, term, became, common, in, the, current, sense, in, great, britain, during, the, 1870s, by, the, 1880, s, it, was, used, with, a, positive, connotation, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, being, used, to, describe, the, behavior, of, empires, at, all, times, and, places, hannah, arendt, and, joseph, schumpeter, defined, imperialism, as, expansion, for, the, sake, of, expansion, the, term, was, and, is, mainly, applied, to, western, and, japanese, political, and, economic, dominance, especially, in, asia, and, africa, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, its, precise, meaning, continues, to, be, debated, by, scholars, some, writers, such, as, edward, said, use, the, term, more, broadly, to, describe, any, system, of, domination, and, subordination, organized, around, an, imperial, core, and, a, periphery, this, definition, encompasses, both, nominal, empires, and, neocolonialism, the, term, imperialism, is, often, conflated, with, colonialism, however, many, scholars, have, argued, that, each, has, its, own, distinct, definition, imperialism, and, colonialism, have, been, used, in, order, to, describe, one, s, influence, upon, a, person, or, group, of, people, robert, young, writes, that, imperialism, operates, from, the, centre, as, a, state, policy, and, is, developed, for, ideological, as, well, as, financial, reasons, while, colonialism, is, simply, the, development, for, settlement, or, commercial, intentions, however, colonialism, still, includes, invasion, colonialism, in, modern, usage, also, tends, to, imply, a, degree, of, geographic, separation, between, the, colony, and, the, imperial, power, particularly, edward, said, distinguishes, between, imperialism, and, colonialism, by, stating, imperialism, involved, the, practice, the, theory, and, the, attitudes, of, a, dominating, metropolitan, center, ruling, a, distant, territory, while, colonialism, refers, to, the, implanting, of, settlements, on, a, distant, territory, contiguous, land, empires, such, as, the, russian, chinese, or, ottoman, have, traditionally, been, excluded, from, discussions, of, colonialism, though, this, is, beginning, to, change, since, it, is, accepted, that, they, also, sent, populations, into, the, territories, they, ruled, 116, imperialism, and, colonialism, both, dictate, the, political, and, economic, advantage, over, a, land, and, the, indigenous, populations, they, control, yet, scholars, sometimes, find, it, difficult, to, illustrate, the, difference, between, the, two, 107, although, imperialism, and, colonialism, focus, on, the, suppression, of, another, if, colonialism, refers, to, the, process, of, a, country, taking, physical, control, of, another, imperialism, refers, to, the, political, and, monetary, dominance, either, formally, or, informally, colonialism, is, seen, to, be, the, architect, deciding, how, to, start, dominating, areas, and, then, imperialism, can, be, seen, as, creating, the, idea, behind, conquest, cooperating, with, colonialism, colonialism, is, when, the, imperial, nation, begins, a, conquest, over, an, area, and, then, eventually, is, able, to, rule, over, the, areas, the, previous, nation, had, controlled, colonialism, s, core, meaning, is, the, exploitation, of, the, valuable, assets, and, supplies, of, the, nation, that, was, conquered, and, the, conquering, nation, then, gaining, the, benefits, from, the, spoils, of, the, war, 170, 75, the, meaning, of, imperialism, is, to, create, an, empire, by, conquering, the, other, state, s, lands, and, therefore, increasing, its, own, dominance, colonialism, is, the, builder, and, preserver, of, the, colonial, possessions, in, an, area, by, a, population, coming, from, a, foreign, region, 173, 76, colonialism, can, completely, change, the, existing, social, structure, physical, structure, and, economics, of, an, area, it, is, not, unusual, that, the, characteristics, of, the, conquering, peoples, are, inherited, by, the, conquered, indigenous, populations, 41, few, colonies, remain, remote, from, their, mother, country, thus, most, will, eventually, establish, a, separate, nationality, or, remain, under, complete, control, of, their, mother, colony, the, soviet, leader, vladimir, lenin, suggested, that, imperialism, was, the, highest, form, of, capitalism, claiming, that, imperialism, developed, after, colonialism, and, was, distinguished, from, colonialism, by, monopoly, capitalism, 116, the, age, of, imperialism, a, time, period, beginning, around, 1760, saw, european, industrializing, nations, engaging, in, the, process, of, colonizing, influencing, and, annexing, other, parts, of, the, world, 19th, century, episodes, included, the, scramble, for, africa, in, the, 1970s, british, historians, john, gallagher, 1919, 1980, and, ronald, robinson, 1920, 1999, argued, that, european, leaders, rejected, the, notion, that, imperialism, required, formal, legal, control, by, one, government, over, a, colonial, region, much, more, important, was, informal, control, of, independent, areas, according, to, wm, roger, louis, in, their, view, historians, have, been, mesmerized, by, formal, empire, and, maps, of, the, world, with, regions, colored, red, the, bulk, of, british, emigration, trade, and, capital, went, to, areas, outside, the, formal, british, empire, key, to, their, thinking, is, the, idea, of, empire, informally, if, possible, and, formally, if, necessary, oron, hale, says, that, gallagher, and, robinson, looked, at, the, british, involvement, in, africa, where, they, found, few, capitalists, less, capital, and, not, much, pressure, from, the, alleged, traditional, promoters, of, colonial, expansion, cabinet, decisions, to, annex, or, not, to, annex, were, made, usually, on, the, basis, of, political, or, geopolitical, considerations, 6, looking, at, the, main, empires, from, 1875, to, 1914, there, was, a, mixed, record, in, terms, of, profitability, at, first, planners, expected, that, colonies, would, provide, an, excellent, captive, market, for, manufactured, items, apart, from, the, indian, subcontinent, this, was, seldom, true, by, the, 1890s, imperialists, saw, the, economic, benefit, primarily, in, the, production, of, inexpensive, raw, materials, to, feed, the, domestic, manufacturing, sector, overall, great, britain, did, very, well, in, terms, of, profits, from, india, especially, mughal, bengal, but, not, from, most, of, the, rest, of, its, empire, according, to, indian, economist, utsa, patnaik, the, scale, of, the, wealth, transfer, out, of, india, between, 1765, and, 1938, was, an, estimated, 45, trillion, the, netherlands, did, very, well, in, the, east, indies, germany, and, italy, got, very, little, trade, or, raw, materials, from, their, empires, france, did, slightly, better, the, belgian, congo, was, notoriously, profitable, when, it, was, a, capitalistic, rubber, plantation, owned, and, operated, by, king, leopold, ii, as, a, private, enterprise, however, scandal, after, scandal, regarding, atrocities, in, the, congo, free, state, led, the, international, community, to, force, the, government, of, belgium, to, take, it, over, in, 1908, and, it, became, much, less, profitable, the, philippines, cost, the, united, states, much, more, than, expected, because, of, military, action, against, rebels, 7, 10, because, of, the, resources, made, available, by, imperialism, the, world, s, economy, grew, significantly, and, became, much, more, interconnected, in, the, decades, before, world, war, i, making, the, many, imperial, powers, rich, and, prosperous, europe, s, expansion, into, territorial, imperialism, was, largely, focused, on, economic, growth, by, collecting, resources, from, colonies, in, combination, with, assuming, political, control, by, military, and, political, means, the, colonization, of, india, in, the, mid, 18th, century, offers, an, example, of, this, focus, there, the, british, exploited, the, political, weakness, of, the, mughal, state, and, while, military, activity, was, important, at, various, times, the, economic, and, administrative, incorporation, of, local, elites, was, also, of, crucial, significance, for, the, establishment, of, control, over, the, subcontinent, s, resources, markets, and, manpower, although, a, substantial, number, of, colonies, had, been, designed, to, provide, economic, profit, and, to, ship, resources, to, home, ports, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, d, k, fieldhouse, suggests, that, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, in, places, such, as, africa, and, asia, this, idea, is, not, necessarily, valid, modern, empires, were, not, artificially, constructed, economic, machines, the, second, expansion, of, europe, was, a, complex, historical, process, in, which, political, social, and, emotional, forces, in, europe, and, on, the, periphery, were, more, influential, than, calculated, imperialism, individual, colonies, might, serve, an, economic, purpose, collectively, no, empire, had, any, definable, function, economic, or, otherwise, empires, represented, only, a, particular, phase, in, the, ever, changing, relationship, of, europe, with, the, rest, of, the, world, analogies, with, industrial, systems, or, investment, in, real, estate, were, simply, misleading, 184, during, this, time, european, merchants, had, the, ability, to, roam, the, high, seas, and, appropriate, surpluses, from, around, the, world, sometimes, peaceably, sometimes, violently, and, to, concentrate, them, in, europe, european, expansion, greatly, accelerated, in, the, 19th, century, to, obtain, raw, materials, europe, expanded, imports, from, other, countries, and, from, the, colonies, european, industrialists, sought, raw, materials, such, as, dyes, cotton, vegetable, oils, and, metal, ores, from, overseas, concurrently, industrialization, was, quickly, making, europe, the, centre, of, manufacturing, and, economic, growth, driving, resource, needs, communication, became, much, more, advanced, during, european, expansion, with, the, invention, of, railroads, and, telegraphs, it, became, easier, to, communicate, with, other, countries, and, to, extend, the, administrative, control, of, a, home, nation, over, its, colonies, steam, railroads, and, steam, driven, ocean, shipping, made, possible, the, fast, cheap, transport, of, massive, amounts, of, goods, to, and, from, colonies, along, with, advancements, in, communication, europe, also, continued, to, advance, in, military, technology, european, chemists, made, new, explosives, that, made, artillery, much, more, deadly, by, the, 1880s, the, machine, gun, had, become, a, reliable, battlefield, weapon, this, technology, gave, european, armies, an, advantage, over, their, opponents, as, armies, in, less, developed, countries, were, still, fighting, with, arrows, swords, and, leather, shields, e, g, the, zulus, in, southern, africa, during, the, anglo, zulu, war, of, 1879, some, exceptions, of, armies, that, managed, to, get, nearly, on, par, with, the, european, expeditions, and, standards, include, the, ethiopian, armies, at, the, battle, of, adwa, and, the, japanese, imperial, army, of, japan, but, these, still, relied, heavily, on, weapons, imported, from, europe, and, often, on, european, military, advisors, anglophone, academic, studies, often, base, their, theories, regarding, imperialism, on, the, british, experience, of, empire, the, term, imperialism, was, originally, introduced, into, english, in, its, present, sense, in, the, late, 1870s, by, opponents, of, the, allegedly, aggressive, and, ostentatious, imperial, policies, of, british, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, supporters, of, imperialism, such, as, joseph, chamberlain, quickly, appropriated, the, concept, for, some, imperialism, designated, a, policy, of, idealism, and, philanthropy, others, alleged, that, it, was, characterized, by, political, self, interest, and, a, growing, number, associated, it, with, capitalist, greed, historians, and, political, theorists, have, long, debated, the, correlation, between, capitalism, class, and, imperialism, much, of, the, debate, was, pioneered, by, such, theorists, as, john, a, hobson, 1858, 1940, joseph, schumpeter, 1883, 1950, thorstein, veblen, 1857, 1929, and, norman, angell, 1872, 1967, while, these, non, marxist, writers, were, at, their, most, prolific, before, world, war, i, they, remained, active, in, the, interwar, years, their, combined, work, informed, the, study, of, imperialism, and, its, impact, on, europe, as, well, as, contributing, to, reflections, on, the, rise, of, the, military, political, complex, in, the, united, states, from, the, 1950s, in, imperialism, a, study, 1902, hobson, developed, a, highly, influential, interpretation, of, imperialism, that, expanded, on, his, belief, that, free, enterprise, capitalism, had, a, negative, impact, on, the, majority, of, the, population, in, imperialism, he, argued, that, the, financing, of, overseas, empires, drained, money, that, was, needed, at, home, it, was, invested, abroad, because, of, lower, wages, paid, to, the, workers, overseas, made, for, higher, profits, and, higher, rates, of, return, compared, to, domestic, wages, so, although, domestic, wages, remained, higher, they, did, not, grow, nearly, as, fast, as, they, might, have, otherwise, exporting, capital, he, concluded, put, a, lid, on, the, growth, of, domestic, wages, in, the, domestic, standard, of, living, hobson, theorized, that, domestic, social, reforms, could, cure, the, international, disease, of, imperialism, by, removing, its, economic, foundation, while, state, intervention, through, taxation, could, boost, broader, consumption, create, wealth, and, encourage, a, peaceful, tolerant, multipolar, world, order, by, the, 1970s, historians, such, as, david, k, fieldhouse, and, oron, hale, could, argue, that, the, hobsonian, foundation, has, been, almost, completely, demolished, 5, 6, it, was, not, businessmen, and, bankers, but, politicians, who, went, with, the, stream, of, the, masses, the, modern, imperialism, was, primarily, a, political, product, caused, by, the, national, mass, hysteria, rather, than, by, the, much, abused, capitalists, the, british, experience, failed, to, support, it, similarly, american, historian, david, landes, claims, that, businessmen, were, less, enthusiastic, about, colonialism, than, statesmen, and, adventurers, however, european, marxists, picked, up, hobson, s, ideas, wholeheartedly, and, made, it, into, their, own, theory, of, imperialism, most, notably, in, vladimir, lenin, s, imperialism, the, highest, stage, of, capitalism, 1916, lenin, portrayed, imperialism, as, the, closure, of, the, world, market, and, the, end, of, capitalist, free, competition, that, arose, from, the, need, for, capitalist, economies, to, constantly, expand, investment, material, resources, and, manpower, in, such, a, way, that, necessitated, colonial, expansion, later, marxist, theoreticians, echo, this, conception, of, imperialism, as, a, structural, feature, of, capitalism, which, explained, the, world, war, as, the, battle, between, imperialists, for, control, of, external, markets, lenin, s, treatise, became, a, standard, textbook, that, flourished, until, the, collapse, of, communism, in, 1989, 91, some, theoreticians, on, the, non, communist, left, have, emphasized, the, structural, or, systemic, character, of, imperialism, such, writers, have, expanded, the, period, associated, with, the, term, so, that, it, now, designates, neither, a, policy, nor, a, short, space, of, decades, in, the, late, 19th, century, but, a, world, system, extending, over, a, period, of, centuries, often, going, back, to, colonization, and, in, some, accounts, to, the, crusades, as, the, application, of, the, term, has, expanded, its, meaning, has, shifted, along, five, distinct, but, often, parallel, axes, the, moral, the, economic, the, systemic, the, cultural, and, the, temporal, those, changes, reflect, among, other, shifts, in, sensibility, a, growing, unease, even, great, distaste, with, the, pervasiveness, of, such, power, specifically, western, power, walter, rodney, in, his, 1972, how, europe, underdeveloped, africa, proposes, the, idea, that, imperialism, is, a, phase, of, capitalism, in, which, western, european, capitalist, countries, the, us, and, japan, established, political, economic, military, and, cultural, hegemony, over, other, parts, of, the, world, which, were, initially, at, a, lower, level, and, therefore, could, not, resist, domination, as, a, result, imperialism, for, many, years, embraced, the, whole, world, one, part, being, the, exploiters, and, the, other, the, exploited, one, part, being, dominated, and, the, other, acting, as, overlords, one, part, making, policy, and, the, other, being, dependent, imperialism, has, also, been, identified, in, newer, phenomena, like, space, development, and, its, governing, context, imperial, control, territorial, and, cultural, is, justified, through, discourses, about, the, imperialists, understanding, of, different, spaces, conceptually, imagined, geographies, explain, the, limitations, of, the, imperialist, understanding, of, the, societies, of, the, different, spaces, inhabited, by, the, non, european, other, in, orientalism, 1978, edward, said, said, that, the, west, developed, the, concept, of, the, orient, an, imagined, geography, of, the, eastern, world, which, functions, as, an, essentializing, discourse, that, represents, neither, the, ethnic, diversity, nor, the, social, reality, of, the, eastern, world, that, by, reducing, the, east, into, cultural, essences, the, imperial, discourse, uses, place, based, identities, to, create, cultural, difference, and, psychologic, distance, between, we, the, west, and, they, the, east, and, between, here, in, the, west, and, there, in, the, east, that, cultural, differentiation, was, especially, noticeable, in, the, books, and, paintings, of, early, oriental, studies, the, european, examinations, of, the, orient, which, misrepresented, the, east, as, irrational, and, backward, the, opposite, of, the, rational, and, progressive, west, defining, the, east, as, a, negative, vision, of, the, western, world, as, its, inferior, not, only, increased, the, sense, of, self, of, the, west, but, also, was, a, way, of, ordering, the, east, and, making, it, known, to, the, west, so, that, it, could, be, dominated, and, controlled, therefore, orientalism, was, the, ideological, justification, of, early, western, imperialism, a, body, of, knowledge, and, ideas, that, rationalized, social, cultural, political, and, economic, control, of, other, non, white, peoples, 116, one, of, the, main, tools, used, by, imperialists, was, cartography, cartography, is, the, art, science, and, technology, of, making, maps, but, this, definition, is, problematic, it, implies, that, maps, are, objective, representations, of, the, world, when, in, reality, they, serve, very, political, means, for, harley, maps, serve, as, an, example, of, foucault, s, power, and, knowledge, concept, to, better, illustrate, this, idea, bassett, focuses, his, analysis, of, the, role, of, 19th, century, maps, during, the, scramble, for, africa, he, states, that, maps, contributed, to, empire, by, promoting, assisting, and, legitimizing, the, extension, of, french, and, british, power, into, west, africa, during, his, analysis, of, 19th, century, cartographic, techniques, he, highlights, the, use, of, blank, space, to, denote, unknown, or, unexplored, territory, this, provided, incentives, for, imperial, and, colonial, powers, to, obtain, information, to, fill, in, blank, spaces, on, contemporary, maps, although, cartographic, processes, advanced, through, imperialism, further, analysis, of, their, progress, reveals, many, biases, linked, to, eurocentrism, according, to, bassett, ineteenth, century, explorers, commonly, requested, africans, to, sketch, maps, of, unknown, areas, on, the, ground, many, of, those, maps, were, highly, regarded, for, their, accuracy, but, were, not, printed, in, europe, unless, europeans, verified, them, imperialism, in, pre, modern, times, was, common, in, the, form, of, expansionism, through, vassalage, and, conquest, the, concept, of, cultural, imperialism, refers, to, the, cultural, influence, of, one, dominant, culture, over, others, i, e, a, form, of, soft, power, which, changes, the, moral, cultural, and, societal, worldview, of, the, subordinate, culture, this, means, more, than, just, foreign, music, television, or, film, becoming, popular, with, young, people, rather, that, a, populace, changes, its, own, expectations, of, life, desiring, for, their, own, country, to, become, more, like, the, foreign, country, depicted, for, example, depictions, of, opulent, american, lifestyles, in, the, soap, opera, dallas, during, the, cold, war, changed, the, expectations, of, romanians, a, more, recent, example, is, the, influence, of, smuggled, south, korean, drama, series, in, north, korea, the, importance, of, soft, power, is, not, lost, on, authoritarian, regimes, which, may, oppose, such, influence, with, bans, on, foreign, popular, culture, control, of, the, internet, and, of, unauthorized, satellite, dishes, etc, nor, is, such, a, usage, of, culture, recent, as, part, of, roman, imperialism, local, elites, would, be, exposed, to, the, benefits, and, luxuries, of, roman, culture, and, lifestyle, with, the, aim, that, they, would, then, become, willing, participants, imperialism, has, been, subject, to, moral, or, immoral, censure, by, its, critics, and, thus, the, term, imperialism, is, frequently, used, in, international, propaganda, as, a, pejorative, for, expansionist, and, aggressive, foreign, policy, an, empire, mentality, may, build, on, and, bolster, views, contrasting, primitive, and, advanced, peoples, and, cultures, thus, justifying, and, encouraging, imperialist, practices, among, participants, associated, psychological, tropes, include, the, white, man, s, burden, and, the, idea, of, civilizing, mission, french, mission, civilatrice, the, political, concept, social, imperialism, is, a, marxist, expression, first, used, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, lenin, as, socialist, in, words, imperialist, in, deeds, describing, the, fabian, society, and, other, socialist, organizations, later, in, a, split, with, the, soviet, union, mao, zedong, criticized, its, leaders, as, social, imperialists, stephen, howe, has, summarized, his, view, on, the, beneficial, effects, of, the, colonial, empires, at, least, some, of, the, great, modern, empires, the, british, french, austro, hungarian, russian, and, even, the, ottoman, have, virtues, that, have, been, too, readily, forgotten, they, provided, stability, security, and, legal, order, for, their, subjects, they, constrained, and, at, their, best, tried, to, transcend, the, potentially, savage, ethnic, or, religious, antagonisms, among, the, peoples, and, the, aristocracies, which, ruled, most, of, them, were, often, far, more, liberal, humane, and, cosmopolitan, than, their, supposedly, ever, more, democratic, successors, a, controversial, aspect, of, imperialism, is, the, defense, and, justification, of, empire, building, based, on, seemingly, rational, grounds, in, ancient, china, tianxia, denoted, the, lands, space, and, area, divinely, appointed, to, the, emperor, by, universal, and, well, defined, principles, of, order, the, center, of, this, land, was, directly, apportioned, to, the, imperial, court, forming, the, center, of, a, world, view, that, centered, on, the, imperial, court, and, went, concentrically, outward, to, major, and, minor, officials, and, then, the, common, citizens, tributary, states, and, finally, ending, with, the, fringe, barbarians, tianxia, s, idea, of, hierarchy, gave, chinese, a, privileged, position, and, was, justified, through, the, promise, of, order, and, peace, the, purportedly, scientific, nature, of, social, darwinism, and, a, theory, of, races, formed, a, supposedly, rational, justification, for, imperialism, under, this, doctrine, the, french, politician, jules, ferry, could, declare, in, 1883, that, superior, races, have, a, right, because, they, have, a, duty, they, have, the, duty, to, civilize, the, inferior, races, j, a, hobson, identifies, this, justification, on, general, grounds, as, it, is, desirable, that, the, earth, should, be, peopled, governed, and, developed, as, far, as, possible, by, the, races, which, can, do, this, work, best, i, e, by, the, races, of, highest, social, efficiency, the, royal, geographical, society, of, london, and, other, geographical, societies, in, europe, had, great, influence, and, were, able, to, fund, travelers, who, would, come, back, with, tales, of, their, discoveries, these, societies, also, served, as, a, space, for, travellers, to, share, these, stories, 117, political, geographers, such, as, friedrich, ratzel, of, germany, and, halford, mackinder, of, britain, also, supported, imperialism, 117,

ending, in, 1868, with, the, reunification, of, political, power, under, the, japanese, emperor, during, the, meiji, restoration, this, sparked, a, period, of, rapid, industrialization, driven, in, part, by, a, japanese, desire, for, self, sufficiency, by, the, early, 1900s, japan, was, a, naval, power, that, could, hold, its, own, against, an, established, european, power, as, it, defeated, russia, despite, its, rising, population, and, increasingly, industrialized, economy, japan, lacked, significant, natural, resources, as, a, result, the, country, turned, to, imperialism, and, expansionism, in, part, as, a, means, of, compensating, for, these, shortcomings, adopting, the, national, motto, fukoku, ky, hei, enrich, the, state, strengthen, the, military, and, japan, was, eager, to, take, every, opportunity, in, 1869, they, took, advantage, of, the, defeat, of, the, rebels, of, the, republic, of, ezo, to, incorporate, definitely, the, island, of, hokkaido, to, japan, for, centuries, japan, viewed, the, ryukyu, islands, as, one, of, its, provinces, in, 1871, the, mudan, incident, happened, taiwanese, aborigines, murdered, 54, ry, ky, an, sailors, that, became, shipwrecked, at, that, time, the, ryukyu, islands, were, claimed, by, both, qing, china, and, japan, and, the, japanese, interpreted, the, incident, as, an, attack, on, their, citizens, they, took, steps, to, bring, the, islands, in, their, jurisdiction, in, 1872, the, japanese, ryukyu, domain, was, declared, and, in, 1874, a, retaliatory, incursion, to, taiwan, was, sent, which, was, a, success, the, success, of, this, expedition, emboldened, the, japanese, not, even, the, americans, could, defeat, the, taiwanese, in, the, formosa, expedition, of, 1867, very, few, gave, it, much, thought, at, the, time, but, this, was, the, first, move, in, the, japanese, expansionism, series, japan, occupied, taiwan, for, the, rest, of, 1874, and, then, left, owing, to, chinese, pressures, but, in, 1879, it, finally, annexed, the, ryukyu, islands, in, 1875, qing, china, sent, a, 300, men, force, to, subdue, the, taiwanese, but, unlike, the, japanese, the, chinese, were, routed, ambushed, and, 250, of, their, men, were, killed, the, failure, of, this, expedition, exposed, once, more, the, failure, of, qing, china, to, exert, effective, control, in, taiwan, and, acted, as, another, incentive, for, the, japanese, to, annex, taiwan, eventually, the, spoils, for, winning, the, first, sino, japanese, war, in, 1894, included, taiwan, in, 1875, japan, took, its, first, operation, against, joseon, korea, another, territory, that, for, centuries, it, coveted, the, ganghwa, island, incident, made, korea, open, to, international, trade, korea, was, annexed, in, 1910, as, a, result, of, winning, the, russo, japanese, war, in, 1905, japan, took, part, of, sakhalin, island, from, russia, precisely, the, victory, against, the, russian, empire, shook, the, world, never, before, had, an, asian, nation, defeated, a, european, power, and, in, japan, it, was, seen, as, a, feat, japan, s, victory, against, russia, would, act, as, an, antecedent, for, asian, countries, in, the, fight, against, the, western, powers, for, decolonization, during, world, war, i, japan, took, german, leased, territories, in, china, s, shandong, province, as, well, as, the, mariana, caroline, and, marshall, islands, and, kept, the, islands, as, league, of, nations, mandates, at, first, japan, was, in, good, standing, with, the, victorious, allied, powers, of, world, war, i, but, different, discrepancies, and, dissatisfaction, with, the, rewards, of, the, treaties, cooled, the, relations, with, them, for, example, american, pressure, forced, it, to, return, the, shandong, area, by, the, 30s, economic, depression, urgency, of, resources, and, a, growing, distrust, in, the, allied, powers, made, japan, lean, to, a, hardened, militaristic, stance, through, the, decade, it, would, grow, closer, to, germany, and, italy, forming, together, the, axis, alliance, in, 1931, japan, took, manchuria, from, china, international, reactions, condemned, this, move, but, japan, s, already, strong, skepticism, against, allied, nations, meant, that, it, nevertheless, carried, on, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, in, 1937, japan, s, military, invaded, central, china, also, in, 1938, 1939, japan, made, an, attempt, to, seize, the, territory, of, soviet, russia, and, mongolia, but, suffered, a, serious, defeats, see, battle, of, lake, khasan, battles, of, khalkhin, gol, by, now, relations, with, the, allied, powers, were, at, the, bottom, and, an, international, boycott, against, japan, to, deprive, it, of, natural, resources, was, enforced, a, military, move, to, gain, access, to, them, was, deemed, necessary, and, so, japan, attacked, pearl, harbor, bringing, the, united, states, to, world, war, ii, using, its, superior, technological, advances, in, naval, aviation, and, its, modern, doctrines, of, amphibious, and, naval, warfare, japan, achieved, one, of, the, fastest, maritime, expansions, in, history, by, 1942, japan, had, conquered, much, of, east, asia, and, the, pacific, including, the, east, of, china, hong, kong, thailand, vietnam, cambodia, burma, myanmar, malaysia, the, philippines, indonesia, part, of, new, guinea, and, many, islands, of, the, pacific, ocean, just, as, japan, s, late, industrialization, success, and, victory, against, the, russian, empire, was, seen, as, an, example, among, underdeveloped, asia, pacific, nations, the, japanese, took, advantage, of, this, and, promoted, among, its, conquered, the, goal, to, jointly, create, an, anti, european, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, this, plan, helped, the, japanese, gain, support, from, native, populations, during, its, conquests, especially, in, indonesia, however, the, united, states, had, a, vastly, stronger, military, and, industrial, base, and, defeated, japan, stripping, it, of, conquests, and, returning, its, settlers, back, to, japan, the, most, notable, example, of, dutch, imperialism, is, regarding, indonesia, the, ottoman, empire, was, an, imperial, state, that, lasted, from, 1299, to, 1922, in, 1453, mehmed, the, conqueror, captured, constantinople, and, made, it, his, capital, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, in, particular, at, the, height, of, its, power, under, the, reign, of, suleiman, the, magnificent, the, ottoman, empire, was, a, powerful, multinational, multilingual, empire, which, invaded, and, colonized, much, of, southeast, europe, western, asia, the, caucasus, north, africa, and, the, horn, of, africa, its, repeated, invasions, and, brutal, treatment, of, slavs, led, to, the, great, migrations, of, the, serbs, to, escape, persecution, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, the, empire, contained, 32, provinces, and, numerous, vassal, states, some, of, these, were, later, absorbed, into, the, empire, while, others, were, granted, various, types, of, autonomy, during, the, course, of, centuries, following, a, long, period, of, military, setbacks, against, european, powers, the, ottoman, empire, gradually, declined, losing, control, of, much, of, its, territory, in, europe, and, africa, by, 1810, egypt, was, effectively, independent, in, 1821, 1829, the, greeks, in, the, greek, war, of, independence, were, assisted, by, russia, britain, and, france, in, 1815, to, 1914, the, ottoman, empire, could, exist, only, in, the, conditions, of, acute, rivalry, of, the, great, powers, with, britain, its, main, supporter, especially, in, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, against, russia, after, ottoman, defeat, in, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 1878, bulgaria, serbia, and, montenegro, gained, independence, and, britain, took, colonial, control, of, cyprus, while, bosnia, and, herzegovina, were, occupied, and, annexed, by, austro, hungarian, empire, in, 1908, the, empire, allied, with, germany, in, world, war, i, with, the, imperial, ambition, of, recovering, its, lost, territories, but, it, dissolved, in, the, aftermath, of, its, decisive, defeat, the, kemalist, national, movement, supported, by, soviet, russia, achieved, victory, in, the, course, of, the, turkish, war, of, independence, and, the, parties, signed, and, ratified, the, treaty, of, lausanne, in, 1923, and, 1924, the, republic, of, turkey, was, established, by, the, 18th, century, the, russian, empire, extended, its, control, to, the, pacific, peacefully, forming, a, common, border, with, the, qing, empire, and, empire, of, japan, this, took, place, in, a, large, number, of, military, invasions, of, the, lands, east, west, and, south, of, it, the, polish, russian, war, of, 1792, took, place, after, polish, nobility, from, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, wrote, the, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, the, war, resulted, in, eastern, poland, being, conquered, by, imperial, russia, as, a, colony, until, 1918, the, southern, campaigns, involved, a, series, of, russo, persian, wars, which, began, with, the, persian, expedition, of, 1796, resulting, in, the, acquisition, of, georgia, as, a, protectorate, between, 1800, and, 1864, imperial, armies, invaded, south, in, the, russian, conquest, of, the, caucasus, the, murid, war, and, the, russo, circassian, war, this, last, conflict, led, to, the, ethnic, cleansing, of, circassians, from, their, lands, the, russian, conquest, of, siberia, over, the, khanate, of, sibir, took, place, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, and, resulted, in, the, slaughter, of, various, indigenous, tribes, by, russians, including, the, daur, the, koryaks, the, itelmens, mansi, people, and, the, chukchi, the, russian, colonization, of, central, and, eastern, europe, and, siberia, and, treatment, of, the, resident, indigenous, peoples, has, been, compared, to, european, colonization, of, the, americas, with, similar, negative, impacts, on, the, indigenous, siberians, as, upon, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, extermination, of, indigenous, siberian, tribes, was, so, complete, that, a, relatively, small, population, of, only, 180, 000, are, said, to, exist, today, the, russian, empire, exploited, and, suppressed, cossacks, hosts, during, this, period, before, turning, them, into, the, special, military, estate, sosloviye, in, the, late, 18th, century, cossacks, were, then, used, in, imperial, russian, campaigns, against, other, tribes, the, acquisition, of, ukraine, by, russia, commenced, in, 1654, with, the, pereiaslav, agreement, georgia, s, accession, to, russia, in, 1783, was, marked, by, the, treaty, of, georgievsk, bolshevik, leaders, had, effectively, reestablished, a, polity, with, roughly, the, same, extent, as, that, empire, by, 1921, however, with, an, internationalist, ideology, lenin, in, particular, asserted, the, right, to, limited, self, determination, for, national, minorities, within, the, new, territory, beginning, in, 1923, the, policy, of, indigenization, was, intended, to, support, non, russians, develop, their, national, cultures, within, a, socialist, framework, never, formally, revoked, it, stopped, being, implemented, after, 1932, after, world, war, ii, the, soviet, union, installed, socialist, regimes, modeled, on, those, it, had, installed, in, 1919, 20, in, the, old, russian, empire, in, areas, its, forces, occupied, in, eastern, europe, the, soviet, union, and, later, the, people, s, republic, of, china, supported, revolutionary, and, communist, movements, in, foreign, nations, and, colonies, to, advance, their, own, interests, but, were, not, always, successful, the, ussr, provided, great, assistance, to, kuomintang, in, 1926, 1928, in, the, formation, of, a, unified, chinese, government, see, northern, expedition, although, then, relations, with, the, ussr, deteriorated, but, the, ussr, was, the, only, world, power, that, provided, military, assistance, to, china, against, japanese, aggression, in, 1937, 1941, see, sino, soviet, non,

believed, that, the, revolution, could, only, succeed, in, russia, as, part, of, a, world, revolution, lenin, wrote, extensively, on, the, matter, and, famously, declared, that, imperialism, was, the, highest, stage, of, capitalism, however, after, lenin, s, death, joseph, stalin, established, socialism, in, one, country, for, the, soviet, union, creating, the, model, for, subsequent, inward, looking, stalinist, states, and, purging, the, early, internationalist, elements, the, internationalist, tendencies, of, the, early, revolution, would, be, abandoned, until, they, returned, in, the, framework, of, a, client, state, in, competition, with, the, americans, during, the, cold, war, in, the, post, stalin, period, in, the, late, 1950s, the, new, political, leader, nikita, khrushchev, put, pressure, on, the, soviet, american, relations, by, starting, a, new, wave, of, anti, imperialist, propaganda, in, his, speech, on, the, un, conference, in, 1960, he, announced, the, continuation, of, the, war, on, imperialism, stating, that, soon, the, people, of, different, countries, will, come, together, and, overthrow, their, imperialist, leaders, although, the, soviet, union, declared, itself, anti, imperialist, critics, argue, that, it, exhibited, traits, common, to, historic, empires, some, scholars, hold, that, the, soviet, union, was, a, hybrid, entity, containing, elements, common, to, both, multinational, empires, and, nation, states, some, also, argued, that, the, ussr, practiced, colonialism, as, did, other, imperial, powers, and, was, carrying, on, the, old, russian, tradition, of, expansion, and, control, mao, zedong, once, argued, that, the, soviet, union, had, itself, become, an, imperialist, power, while, maintaining, a, socialist, fa, ade, moreover, the, ideas, of, imperialism, were, widely, spread, in, action, on, the, higher, levels, of, government, josip, broz, tito, and, milovan, djilas, have, referred, to, the, stalinist, ussr, s, foreign, policies, such, as, the, occupation, and, economic, exploitations, of, eastern, europe, and, its, aggressive, and, hostile, policy, towards, yugoslavia, as, soviet, imperialism, some, marxists, within, the, russian, empire, and, later, the, ussr, like, sultan, galiev, and, vasyl, shakhrai, considered, the, soviet, regime, a, renewed, version, of, the, russian, imperialism, and, colonialism, the, crushing, of, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, and, soviet, afghan, war, have, been, cited, as, examples, contemporary, russian, imperialism, is, seen, by, some, in, russian, occupied, territories, made, up, of, former, colonies, itself, the, early, united, states, expressed, its, opposition, to, imperialism, at, least, in, a, form, distinct, from, its, own, manifest, destiny, through, policies, such, as, the, monroe, doctrine, however, the, us, may, have, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, capture, canada, in, the, war, of, 1812, the, united, states, achieved, very, significant, territorial, concessions, from, mexico, during, the, mexican, american, war, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, policies, such, as, theodore, roosevelt, s, interventionism, in, central, america, and, woodrow, wilson, s, mission, to, make, the, world, safe, for, democracy, changed, all, this, they, were, often, backed, by, military, force, but, were, more, often, affected, from, behind, the, scenes, this, is, consistent, with, the, general, notion, of, hegemony, and, imperium, of, historical, empires, in, 1898, americans, who, opposed, imperialism, created, the, anti, imperialist, league, to, oppose, the, us, annexation, of, the, philippines, and, cuba, one, year, later, a, war, erupted, in, the, philippines, causing, business, labor, and, government, leaders, in, the, us, to, condemn, america, s, occupation, in, the, philippines, as, they, also, denounced, them, for, causing, the, deaths, of, many, filipinos, american, foreign, policy, was, denounced, as, a, racket, by, smedley, butler, a, former, american, general, who, had, become, a, spokesman, for, the, far, left, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, was, opposed, to, european, colonialism, especially, in, india, he, pulled, back, when, britain, s, winston, churchill, demanded, that, victory, in, the, war, be, the, first, priority, roosevelt, expected, that, the, united, nations, would, take, up, the, problem, of, decolonization, some, have, described, the, internal, strife, between, various, people, groups, as, a, form, of, imperialism, or, colonialism, this, internal, form, is, distinct, from, informal, u, s, imperialism, in, the, form, of, political, and, financial, hegemony, it, also, showed, difference, in, the, united, states, formation, of, colonies, abroad, through, the, treatment, of, its, indigenous, peoples, during, westward, expansion, the, united, states, took, on, the, form, of, an, imperial, power, prior, to, any, attempts, at, external, imperialism, this, internal, form, of, empire, has, been, referred, to, as, internal, colonialism, participation, in, the, african, slave, trade, and, the, subsequent, treatment, of, its, 12, to, 15, million, africans, is, viewed, by, some, to, be, a, more, modern, extension, of, america, s, internal, colonialism, however, this, internal, colonialism, faced, resistance, as, external, colonialism, did, but, the, anti, colonial, presence, was, far, less, prominent, due, to, the, nearly, complete, dominance, that, the, united, states, was, able, to, assert, over, both, indigenous, peoples, and, african, americans, in, a, lecture, on, april, 16, 2003, edward, said, described, modern, imperialism, in, the, united, states, as, an, aggressive, means, of, attack, towards, the, contemporary, orient, stating, that, due, to, their, backward, living, lack, of, democracy, and, the, violation, of, women, s, rights, the, western, world, forgets, during, this, process, of, converting, the, other, that, enlightenment, and, democracy, are, concepts, that, not, all, will, agree, upon, spanish, imperialism, in, the, colonial, era, corresponds, with, the, rise, and, decline, of, the, spanish, empire, conventionally, recognized, as, emerging, in, 1402, with, the, conquest, of, the, canary, islands, following, the, successes, of, exploratory, maritime, voyages, conducted, during, the, age, of, discovery, spain, committed, considerable, financial, and, military, resources, towards, developing, a, robust, navy, capable, of, conducting, large, scale, transatlantic, expeditionary, operations, in, order, to, establish, and, solidify, a, firm, imperial, presence, across, large, portions, of, north, america, south, america, and, the, geographic, regions, comprising, the, caribbean, basin, concomitant, with, spanish, endorsement, and, sponsorship, of, transatlantic, expeditionary, voyages, was, the, deployment, of, conquistadors, which, further, expanded, spanish, imperial, boundaries, through, the, acquisition, and, development, of, territories, and, colonies, in, congruence, with, the, colonialist, activities, of, competing, european, imperial, powers, throughout, the, 15th, 19th, centuries, the, spanish, were, equally, engrossed, in, extending, geopolitical, power, the, caribbean, basin, functioned, as, a, key, geographic, focal, point, for, advancing, spanish, imperialism, similar, to, the, strategic, prioritization, spain, placed, towards, achieving, victory, in, the, conquests, of, the, aztec, empire, and, inca, empire, spain, placed, equal, strategic, emphasis, on, expanding, the, nation, s, imperial, footprint, within, the, caribbean, basin, echoing, the, prevailing, ideological, perspectives, regarding, colonialism, and, imperialism, embraced, by, spain, s, european, rivals, during, the, colonial, era, including, the, english, french, and, the, dutch, the, spanish, used, colonialism, as, a, means, of, expanding, imperial, geopolitical, borders, and, securing, the, defense, of, maritime, trade, routes, in, the, caribbean, basin, while, leveraging, colonialism, in, the, same, geographic, operating, theater, as, its, imperial, rivals, spain, maintained, distinct, imperial, objectives, and, instituted, a, unique, form, of, colonialism, in, support, of, its, imperial, agenda, spain, placed, significant, strategic, emphasis, on, the, acquisition, extraction, and, exportation, of, precious, metals, primarily, gold, and, silver, a, second, objective, was, the, evangelization, of, subjugated, indigenous, populations, residing, in, mineral, rich, and, strategically, favorable, locations, notable, examples, of, these, indigenous, groups, include, the, ta, no, populations, inhabiting, puerto, rico, and, segments, of, cuba, compulsory, labor, and, slavery, were, widely, institutionalized, across, spanish, occupied, territories, and, colonies, with, an, initial, emphasis, on, directing, labor, towards, mining, activity, and, related, methods, of, procuring, semi, precious, metals, the, emergence, of, the, encomienda, system, during, the, 16th, 17th, centuries, in, occupied, colonies, within, the, caribbean, basin, reflects, a, gradual, shift, in, imperial, prioritization, increasingly, focusing, on, large, scale, production, and, exportation, of, agricultural, commodities, the, scope, and, scale, of, spanish, participation, in, imperialism, within, the, caribbean, basin, remains, a, subject, of, scholarly, debate, among, historians, a, fundamental, source, of, contention, stems, from, the, inadvertent, conflation, of, theoretical, conceptions, of, imperialism, and, colonialism, furthermore, significant, variation, exists, in, the, definition, and, interpretation, of, these, terms, as, expounded, by, historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and, political, scientists, among, historians, there, is, substantial, support, in, favor, of, approaching, imperialism, as, a, conceptual, theory, emerging, during, the, 18th, 19th, centuries, particularly, within, britain, propagated, by, key, exponents, such, as, joseph, chamberlain, and, benjamin, disraeli, in, accordance, with, this, theoretical, perspective, the, activities, of, the, spanish, in, the, caribbean, are, not, components, of, a, preeminent, ideologically, driven, form, of, imperialism, rather, these, activities, are, more, accurately, classified, as, representing, a, form, of, colonialism, further, divergence, among, historians, can, be, attributed, to, varying, theoretical, perspectives, regarding, imperialism, that, are, proposed, by, emerging, academic, schools, of, thought, noteworthy, examples, include, cultural, imperialism, whereby, proponents, such, as, john, downing, and, annabelle, sreberny, modammadi, define, imperialism, as, the, conquest, and, control, of, one, country, by, a, more, powerful, one, cultural, imperialism, signifies, the, dimensions, of, the, process, that, go, beyond, economic, exploitation, or, military, force, moreover, colonialism, is, understood, as, the, form, of, imperialism, in, which, the, government, of, the, colony, is, run, directly, by, foreigners, in, spite, of, diverging, perspectives, and, the, absence, of, a, unilateral, scholarly, consensus, regarding, imperialism, among, historians, within, the, context, of, spanish, expansion, in, the, caribbean, basin, during, the, colonial, era, imperialism, can, be, interpreted, as, an, overarching, ideological, agenda, that, is, perpetuated, through, the, institution, of, colonialism, in, this, context, colonialism, functions, as, an, instrument, designed, to, achieve, specific, imperialist, objectives, primary, sources
