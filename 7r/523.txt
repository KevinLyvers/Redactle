into, predictable, routes, have, long, created, opportunities, for, piracy, as, well, as, for, privateering, and, commerce, raiding, historic, examples, of, such, areas, include, the, waters, of, gibraltar, the, strait, of, malacca, madagascar, the, gulf, of, aden, and, the, english, channel, whose, geographic, structures, facilitated, pirate, attacks, the, term, piracy, generally, refers, to,

waters, between, the, red, sea, and, the, indian, ocean, off, the, somali, coast, and, in, the, strait, of, malacca, and, singapore, have, frequently, been, targeted, by, modern, pirates, armed, with, automatic, weapons, such, as, assault, rifles, and, machine, guns, grenades, and, rocket, propelled, grenades, they, often, use, small, motorboats, to, attack, and, board, ships, a, tactic, that, takes, advantage, of, the, small, number, of, crew, members, on, modern, cargo, vessels, and, transport, ships, the, international, community, is, facing, many, challenges, in, bringing, modern, pirates, to, justice, as, these, attacks, often, occur, in, international, waters, nations, have, used, their, naval, forces, to, repel, and, pursue, pirates, and, some, private, vessels, use, armed, security, guards, high, pressure, water, cannons, or, sound, cannons, to, repel, boarders, and, use, radar, to, avoid, potential, threats, romanticised, accounts, of, piracy, during, the, age, of, sail, have, long, been, a, part, of, western, pop, culture, the, two, volume, a, general, history, of, the, pyrates, published, in, london, in, 1724, is, generally, credited, with, bringing, key,

and, other, media, across, over, a, century, more, recently, pirates, of, the, golden, age, were, further, stereotyped, and, popularized, by, the, pirates, of, the, caribbean, film, franchise, which, began, in, 2003, the, english, word, pirate, is, derived, from, the, latin, pirata, pirate, corsair, sea, robber, which, comes, from, greek, peirat, s, brigand, from, peir, omai, i, attempt, from, pe, ra, attempt, experience, the, meaning, of, the, greek, word, peirat, s, literally, is, anyone, who, attempts, something, over, time, it, came, to, be, used, of, anyone, who, engaged, in, robbery, or,

perfectly, normal, occurrence, in, many, texts, including, in, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, and, abduction, of, women, and, children, to, be, sold, into, slavery, was, common, by, the, era, of, classical, greece, piracy, was, looked, upon, as, a, disgrace, to, have, as, a, profession, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, pirate, attacks, on, olympus, in, lycia, brought, impoverishment, among, some, of, the, most, famous, ancient, pirateering, peoples, were, the, illyrians, a, people, populating, the, western, balkan, peninsula, constantly, raiding, the, adriatic, sea, the, illyrians, caused, many, conflicts, with, the, roman, republic, it, was, not, until, 229, bc, when, the, romans, decisively, beat, the, illyrian, fleets, that, their, threat, was, ended, during, the, 1st, century, bc,

raided, its, lagoon, city, of, caorle, this, caused, a, byzantine, military, action, against, them, that, brought, christianity, to, them, after, the, arab, raids, on, the, adriatic, coast, circa,

englishman, named, william, maurice, convicted, of, piracy, in, 1241, as, the, first, person, known, to, have, been, hanged, drawn, and, quartered, which, would, indicate, that, the, then, ruling, king, henry, iii, took, an, especially, severe, view, of, this, crime, the, ushkuiniks, were, novgorodian, pirates, who, looted, the, cities, on, the, volga, and, kama, rivers, in, the, 14th, century, as, early, as, byzantine, times, the, maniots, one, of, greece, s, toughest, populations, were, known, as, pirates, the, maniots, considered, piracy, as, a, legitimate, response, to, the, fact, that, their, land, was, poor, and, it, became, their, main, source, of, income, the, main, victims, of, maniot, pirates, were, the, ottomans, but, the, maniots, also, targeted, ships, of, european, countries, zaporizhian, sich, was, a, pirate, republic, in, europe, from, the, 16th, through, to, the, 18th, century, situated, in, cossack, territory, in, the, remote, steppe, of, eastern, europe, it, was, populated, with, ukrainian, peasants, that, had, run, away, from, their, feudal, masters, outlaws, destitute, gentry, run, away, slaves, from, turkish, galleys, etc, the, remoteness, of, the, place, and, the, rapids, at, the, dnieper, river, effectively, guarded, the, place, from, invasions, of, vengeful, powers, the, main, target, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, zaporizhian, sich, who, called, themselves, cossacks, were, rich, settlements, at, the, black, sea, shores, of, ottoman, empire, and, crimean, khanate, by, 1615, and, 1625, zaporozhian, cossacks, had, even, managed, to, raze, townships, on, the, outskirts, of, istanbul, forcing, the, ottoman, sultan, to, flee, his, palace, don, cossacks, under, stenka, razin, even, ravaged, the, persian, coasts, though, less, famous, and, romanticized, than, atlantic, or, caribbean, pirates, corsairs, in, the, mediterranean, equaled, or, outnumbered, the, former, at, any, given, point, in, history, mediterranean, piracy, was, conducted, almost, entirely, with, galleys, until, the, mid, 17th, century, when, they, were, gradually, replaced, with, highly, maneuverable, sailing, vessels, such, as, xebecs, and, brigantines, they, were, of, a, smaller, type, than, battle, galleys, often, referred, to, as, galiots, or, fustas, pirate, galleys, were, small, nimble, lightly, armed, but, often, crewed, in, large, numbers, in, order, to, overwhelm, the, often, minimal, crews, of, merchant, ships, in, general, pirate, craft, were, extremely, difficult, for, patrolling, craft, to, actually, hunt, down, and, capture, anne, hilarion, de, tourville, a, french, admiral, of, the, 17th, century, believed, that, the, only, way, to, run, down, raiders, from, the, infamous, corsair, moroccan, port, of, sal, was, by, using, a, captured, pirate, vessel, of, the, same, type, using, oared, vessels, to, combat, pirates, was, common, and, was, even, practiced, by, the, major, powers, in, the, caribbean, purpose, built, galleys, or, hybrid, sailing, vessels, were, built, by, the, english, in, jamaica, in, 1683, and, by, the, spanish, in, the, late, 16th, century, specially, built, sailing, frigates, with, oar, ports, on, the, lower, decks, like, the, james, galley, and, charles, galley, and, oar, equipped, sloops, proved, highly, useful, for, pirate, hunting, though, they, were, not, built, in, sufficient, numbers, to, check, piracy, until, the, 1720s, the, expansion, of, muslim, power, through, the, ottoman, conquest, of, large, parts, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, resulted, in, extensive, piracy, on, sea, trading, the, so, called, barbary, pirates, began, to, operate, out, of, north, african, ports, in, algiers, tunis, tripoli, morocco, around, 1500, preying, primarily, on, the, shipping, of, christian, powers, including, massive, slave, raids, at, sea, as, well, as, on, land, the, barbary, pirates, were, nominally, under, ottoman, suzerainty, but, had, considerable, independence, to, prey, on, the, enemies, of, islam, the, muslim, corsairs, were, technically, often, privateers, with, support, from, legitimate, though, highly, belligerent, states, they, considered, themselves, as, holy, muslim, warriors, or, ghazis, carrying, on, the, tradition, of, fighting, the, incursion, of, western, christians, that, had, begun, with, the, first, crusade, late, in, the, 11th, century, coastal, villages, and, towns, of, italy, spain, and, islands, in, the, mediterranean, were, frequently, attacked, by, muslim, corsairs, and, long, stretches, of, the, italian, and, spanish, coasts, were, almost, completely, abandoned, by, their, inhabitants, after, 1600, the, barbary, corsairs, occasionally, entered, the, atlantic, and, struck, as, far, north, as, iceland, according, to, robert, davis, between, 1, million, and, 1, 25, million, europeans, were, captured, by, barbary, corsairs, and, sold, as, slaves, in, north, africa, and, the, ottoman, empire, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, the, most, famous, corsairs, were, the, ottoman, albanian, hayreddin, and, his, older, brother, oru, reis, redbeard, turgut, reis, known, as, dragut, in, the, west, kurtoglu, known, as, curtogoli, in, the, west, kemal, reis, salih, reis, and, koca, murat, reis, a, few, barbary, corsairs, such, as, the, dutch, jan, janszoon, and, the, english, john, ward, muslim, name, yusuf, reis, were, renegade, european, privateers, who, had, converted, to, islam, the, barbary, pirates, had, a, direct, christian, counterpart, in, the, military, order, of, the, knights, of, saint, john, that, operated, first, out, of, rhodes, and, after, 1530, malta, though, they, were, less, numerous, and, took, fewer, slaves, both, sides, waged, war, against, the, respective, enemies, of, their, faith, and, both, used, galleys, as, their, primary, weapons, both, sides, also, used, captured, or, bought, galley, slaves, to, man, the, oars, of, their, ships, the, muslims, relied, mostly, on, captured, christians, the, christians, used, a, mix, of, muslim, slaves, christian, convicts, and, a, small, contingency, of, buonavoglie, free, men, who, out, of, desperation, or, poverty, had, taken, to, rowing, historian, peter, earle, has, described, the, two, sides, of, the, christian, muslim, mediterranean, conflict, as, mirror, image, of, maritime, predation, two, businesslike, fleets, of, plunderers, set, against, each, other, this, conflict, of, faith, in, the, form, of, privateering, piracy, and, slave, raiding, generated, a, complex, system, that, was, upheld, financed, operated, on, the, trade, in, plunder, and, slaves, that, was, generated, from, a, low, intensive, conflict, as, well, as, the, need, for, protection, from, violence, the, system, has, been, described, as, a, massive, multinational, protection, racket, the, christian, side, of, which, was, not, ended, until, 1798, in, the, napoleonic, wars, the, barbary, corsairs, were, quelled, as, late, as, the, 1830s, effectively, ending, the, last, vestiges, of, counter, crusading, jihad, piracy, off, the, barbary, coast, was, often, assisted, by, competition, among, european, powers, in, the, 17th, century, france, encouraged, the, corsairs, against, spain, and, later, britain, and, holland, supported, them, against, france, by, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, greater, european, naval, powers, began, to, initiate, reprisals, to, intimidate, the, barbary, states, into, making, peace, with, them, the, most, successful, of, the, christian, states, in, dealing, with, the, corsair, threat, was, england, from, the, 1630s, onwards, england, had, signed, peace, treaties, with, the, barbary, states, on, various, occasions, but, invariably, breaches, of, these, agreements, led, to, renewed, wars, a, particular, bone, of, contention, was, the, tendency, of, foreign, ships, to, pose, as, english, to, avoid, attack, growing, english, naval, power, and, increasingly, persistent, operations, against, the, corsairs, proved, increasingly, costly, for, the, barbary, states, during, the, reign, of, charles, ii, a, series, of, english, expeditions, won, victories, over, raiding, squadrons, and, mounted, attacks, on, their, home, ports, which, permanently, ended, the, barbary, threat, to, english, shipping, in, 1675, a, bombardment, from, a, royal, navy, squadron, led, by, sir, john, narborough, and, further, defeats, at, the, hands, of, a, squadron, under, arthur, herbert, negotiated, a, lasting, peace, until, 1816, with, tunis, and, tripoli, france, which, had, recently, emerged, as, a, leading, naval, power, achieved, comparable, success, soon, afterwards, with, bombardments, of, algiers, in, 1682, 1683, and, 1688, securing, a, lasting, peace, while, tripoli, was, similarly, coerced, in, 1686, in, 1783, and, 1784, the, spaniards, bombarded, algiers, in, an, effort, to, stem, the, piracy, the, second, time, admiral, barcel, damaged, the, city, so, severely, that, the, algerian, dey, asked, spain, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, from, then, on, spanish, vessels, and, coasts, were, safe, for, several, years, until, the, american, declaration, of, independence, in, 1776, british, treaties, with, the, north, african, states, protected, american, ships, from, the, barbary, corsairs, morocco, which, in, 1777, was, the, first, independent, nation, to, publicly, recognize, the, united, states, became, in, 1784, the, first, barbary, power, to, seize, an, american, vessel, after, independence, while, the, united, states, managed, to, secure, peace, treaties, these, obliged, it, to, pay, tribute, for, protection, from, attack, payments, in, ransom, and, tribute, to, the, barbary, states, amounted, to, 20, of, united, states, government, annual, expenditures, in, 1800, leading, to, the, barbary, wars, that, ended, the, payment, of, tribute, algiers, broke, the, 1805, peace, treaty, after, only, two, years, and, refused, to, implement, the, 1815, treaty, until, compelled, to, do, so, by, britain, in, 1816, in, 1815, the, sacking, of, palma, on, the, island, of, sardinia, by, a, tunisian, squadron, which, carried, off, 158, inhabitants, roused, widespread, indignation, britain, had, by, this, time, banned, the, slave, trade, and, was, seeking, to, induce, other, countries, to, do, likewise, this, led, to, complaints, from, states, which, were, still, vulnerable, to, the, corsairs, that, britain, s, enthusiasm, for, ending, the, trade, in, african, slaves, did, not, extend, to, stopping, the, enslavement, of, europeans, and, americans, by, the, barbary, states, in, order, to, neutralise, this, objection, and, further, the, anti, slavery, campaign, in, 1816, lord, exmouth, was, sent, to, secure, new, concessions, from, tripoli, tunis, and, algiers, including, a, pledge, to, treat, christian, captives, in, any, future, conflict, as, prisoners, of, war, rather, than, slaves, and, the, imposition, of, peace, between, algiers, and, the, kingdoms, of, sardinia, and, sicily, on, his, first, visit, he, negotiated, satisfactory, treaties, and, sailed, for, home, while, he, was, negotiating, a, number, of, sardinian, fishermen, who, had, settled, at, bona, on, the, tunisian, coast, were, brutally, treated, without, his, knowledge, as, sardinians, they, were, technically, under, british, protection, and, the, government, sent, exmouth, back, to, secure, reparation, on, august, 17, in, combination, with, a, dutch, squadron, under, admiral, van, de, capellen, he, bombarded, algiers, both, algiers, and, tunis, made, fresh, concessions, as, a, result, securing, uniform, compliance, with, a, total, prohibition, of, slave, raiding, which, was, traditionally, of, central, importance, to, the, north, african, economy, presented, difficulties, beyond, those, faced, in, ending, attacks, on, ships, of, individual, nations, which, had, left, slavers, able, to, continue, their, accustomed, way, of, life, by, preying, on, less, well, protected, peoples, algiers, renewed, its, slave, raiding, though, on, a, smaller, scale, measures, to, be, taken, against, the, city, s, government, were, discussed, at, the, congress, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1818, in, 1820, another, british, fleet, under, admiral, sir, harry, neal, again, bombarded, algiers, corsair, activity, based, in, algiers, did, not, entirely, cease, until, its, conquest, by, france, in, 1830, in, thalassocratic, austronesian, cultures, in, island, southeast, asia, maritime, raids, for, slaves, and, resources, against, rival, polities, have, ancient, origins, it, was, associated, with, prestige, and, prowess, and, often, recorded, in, tattoos, reciprocal, raiding, traditions, were, recorded, by, early, european, cultures, as, being, prevalent, throughout, island, southeast, asia, with, the, advent, of, islam, and, the, colonial, era, slaves, became, a, valuable, resource, for, trading, with, european, arab, and, chinese, slavers, and, the, volume, of, piracy, and, slave, raids, increased, significantly, numerous, native, peoples, engaged, in, sea, raiding, they, include, the, iranun, and, balanguingui, slavers, of, sulu, the, iban, headhunters, of, borneo, the, bugis, sailors, of, south, sulawesi, and, the, malays, of, western, southeast, asia, piracy, was, also, practiced, by, foreign, seafarers, on, a, smaller, scale, including, chinese, japanese, and, european, traders, renegades, and, outlaws, the, volume, of, piracy, and, raids, were, often, dependent, on, the, ebb, and, flow, of, trade, and, monsoons, with, pirate, season, known, colloquially, as, the, pirate, wind, starting, from, august, to, september, slave, raids, were, of, high, economic, importance, to, the, muslim, sultanates, in, the, sulu, sea, the, sultanate, of, sulu, the, sultanate, of, maguindanao, and, the, confederation, of, sultanates, in, lanao, the, modern, moro, people, it, is, estimated, that, from, 1770, to, 1870, around, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, people, were, enslaved, by, iranun, and, banguingui, slavers, david, p, forsythe, put, the, estimate, much, higher, at, around, 2, million, slaves, captured, within, the, first, two, centuries, of, spanish, rule, of, the, philippines, after, 1565, these, slaves, were, taken, from, piracy, on, passing, ships, as, well, as, coastal, raids, on, settlements, as, far, as, the, malacca, strait, java, the, southern, coast, of, china, and, the, islands, beyond, the, makassar, strait, most, of, the, slaves, were, tagalogs, visayans, and, malays, including, bugis, mandarese, iban, and, makassar, there, were, also, occasional, european, and, chinese, captives, who, were, usually, ransomed, off, through, tausug, intermediaries, of, the, sulu, sultanate, slaves, were, the, primary, indicators, of, wealth, and, status, and, they, were, the, source, of, labor, for, the, farms, fisheries, and, workshops, of, the, sultanates, while, personal, slaves, were, rarely, sold, they, trafficked, extensively, in, slaves, purchased, from, the, iranun, and, banguingui, slave, markets, by, the, 1850s, slaves, constituted, 50, or, more, of, the, population, of, the, sulu, archipelago, the, scale, was, so, massive, that, the, word, for, pirate, in, malay, became, lanun, an, exonym, of, the, iranun, people, the, economy, of, the, sulu, sultanates, was, largely, run, by, slaves, and, the, slave, trade, male, captives, of, the, iranun, and, the, banguingui, were, treated, brutally, even, fellow, muslim, captives, were, not, spared, they, were, usually, forced, to, serve, as, galley, slaves, on, the, lanong, and, garay, warships, of, their, captors, female, captives, however, were, usually, treated, better, there, were, no, recorded, accounts, of, rapes, though, some, were, starved, for, discipline, within, a, year, of, capture, most, of, the, captives, of, the, iranun, and, banguingui, would, be, bartered, off, in, jolo, usually, for, rice, opium, bolts, of, cloth, iron, bars, brassware, and, weapons, the, buyers, were, usually, tausug, datu, from, the, sultanate, of, sulu, who, had, preferential, treatment, but, buyers, also, included, european, dutch, and, portuguese, and, chinese, traders, as, well, as, visayan, pirates, renegados, spanish, authorities, and, native, christian, filipinos, responded, to, the, moro, slave, raids, by, building, watchtowers, and, forts, across, the, philippine, archipelago, many, of, which, are, still, standing, today, some, provincial, capitals, were, also, moved, further, inland, major, command, posts, were, built, in, manila, cavite, cebu, iloilo, zamboanga, and, iligan, defending, ships, were, also, built, by, local, communities, especially, in, the, visayas, islands, including, the, construction, of, war, barangayanes, balangay, that, were, faster, than, the, moro, raiders, and, could, give, chase, as, resistance, against, raiders, increased, lanong, warships, of, the, iranun, were, eventually, replaced, by, the, smaller, and, faster, garay, warships, of, the, banguingui, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, moro, raids, were, eventually, subdued, by, several, major, naval, expeditions, by, the, spanish, and, local, forces, from, 1848, to, 1891, including, retaliatory, bombardment, and, capture, of, moro, settlements, by, this, time, the, spanish, had, also, acquired, steam, gunboats, vapor, which, could, easily, overtake, and, destroy, the, native, moro, warships, aside, from, the, iranun, and, banguingui, pirates, other, polities, were, also, associated, with, maritime, raiding, the, bugis, sailors, of, south, sulawesi, were, infamous, as, pirates, who, used, to, range, as, far, west, as, singapore, and, as, far, north, as, the, philippines, in, search, of, targets, for, piracy, the, orang, laut, pirates, controlled, shipping, in, the, straits, of, malacca, and, the, waters, around, singapore, and, the, malay, and, sea, dayak, pirates, preyed, on, maritime, shipping, in, the, waters, between, singapore, and, hong, kong, from, their, haven, in, borneo, in, east, asia, by, the, ninth, century, populations, centered, mostly, around, merchant, activities, in, coastal, shandong, and, jiangsu, wealthy, benefactors, including, jang, bogo, established, silla, buddhist, temples, in, the, region, jang, bogo, had, become, incensed, at, the, treatment, of, his, fellow, countrymen, who, in, the, unstable, milieu, of, late, tang, often, fell, victim, to, coastal, pirates, or, inland, bandits, after, returning, to, silla, around, 825, and, in, possession, of, a, formidable, private, fleet, headquartered, at, cheonghae, wando, jang, bogo, petitioned, the, silla, king, heungdeok, r, 826, 836, to, establish, a, permanent, maritime, garrison, to, protect, silla, merchant, activities, in, the, yellow, sea, heungdeok, agreed, and, in, 828, formally, established, the, cheonghae, clear, sea, garrison, at, what, is, today, wando, island, off, korea, s, south, jeolla, province, heungdeok, gave, jang, an, army, of, 10, 000, men, to, establish, and, man, the, defensive, works, the, remnants, of, cheonghae, garrison, can, still, be, seen, on, jang, islet, just, off, wando, s, southern, coast, jang, s, force, though, nominally, bequeathed, by, the, silla, king, was, effectively, under, his, own, control, jang, became, arbiter, of, yellow, sea, commerce, and, navigation, from, the, 13th, century, wokou, based, in, japan, made, their, debut, in, east, asia, initiating, invasions, that, would, persist, for, 300, years, the, wokou, raids, peaked, in, the, 1550s, but, by, then, the, wokou, were, mostly, chinese, smugglers, who, reacted, strongly, against, the, ming, dynasty, s, strict, prohibition, on, private, sea, trade, during, the, qing, period, chinese, pirate, fleets, grew, increasingly, large, the, effects, large, scale, piracy, had, on, the, chinese, economy, were, immense, they, preyed, voraciously, on, china, s, junk, trade, which, flourished, in, fujian, and, guangdong, and, was, a, vital, artery, of, chinese, commerce, pirate, fleets, exercised, hegemony, over, villages, on, the, coast, collecting, revenue, by, exacting, tribute, and, running, extortion, rackets, in, 1802, the, menacing, zheng, yi, inherited, the, fleet, of, his, cousin, captain, zheng, qi, whose, death, provided, zheng, yi, with, considerably, more, influence, in, the, world, of, piracy, zheng, yi, and, his, wife, zheng, yi, sao, who, would, eventually, inherit, the, leadership, of, his, pirate, confederacy, then, formed, a, pirate, coalition, that, by, 1804, consisted, of, over, ten, thousand, men, their, military, might, alone, was, sufficient, to, combat, the, qing, navy, however, a, combination, of, famine, qing, naval, opposition, and, internal, rifts, crippled, piracy, in, china, around, the, 1820s, and, it, has, never, again, reached, the, same, status, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, united, states, navy, and, royal, navy, forces, campaigned, together, against, chinese, pirates, major, battles, were, fought, such, as, those, at, ty, ho, bay, and, the, tonkin, river, though, pirate, junks, continued, operating, off, china, for, years, more, however, some, british, and, american, individual, citizens, also, volunteered, to, serve, with, chinese, pirates, to, fight, against, european, forces, the, british, offered, rewards, for, the, capture, of, westerners, serving, with, chinese, pirates, during, the, second, opium, war, and, the, taiping, rebellion, piratical, junks, were, again, destroyed, in, large, numbers, by, british, naval, forces, but, ultimately, it, was, not, until, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, that, fleets, of, pirate, junks, ceased, to, exist, chinese, pirates, also, plagued, the, tonkin, gulf, area, pirates, in, the, ming, era, tended, to, come, from, populations, on, the, geographic, periphery, of, the, state, they, were, recruited, largely, from, the, lower, classes, of, society, including, poor, fishermen, and, many, were, fleeing, from, obligatory, labor, on, state, building, projects, organized, by, the, dynasty, these, lower, class, men, and, sometimes, women, may, have, fled, taxation, or, conscription, by, the, state, in, the, search, of, better, opportunities, and, wealth, and, willingly, joined, local, pirate, bands, these, local, lower, class, individuals, seem, to, have, felt, unrepresented, and, traded, the, small, amount, of, security, afforded, them, from, their, allegiance, to, the, state, for, the, promise, of, a, relatively, improved, existence, engaging, in, smuggling, or, other, illegal, trade, originally, pirates, in, the, coastal, areas, near, fujian, and, zhejiang, may, have, been, japanese, suggested, by, the, ming, government, referring, to, them, as, wokou, but, it, is, probable, that, piracy, was, a, multi, ethnic, profession, by, the, 16th, century, although, coastal, brigands, continued, to, be, referred, to, as, wokou, in, many, government, documents, most, pirates, were, probably, han, chinese, but, japanese, and, even, europeans, engaged, in, pirate, activities, in, the, region, pirates, engaged, in, a, number, of, different, schemes, to, make, a, living, smuggling, and, illegal, trade, overseas, were, major, sources, of, revenue, for, pirate, bands, both, large, and, small, as, the, ming, government, mostly, outlawed, private, trade, overseas, at, least, until, the, overseas, silver, trade, contributed, to, a, lifting, of, the, ban, pirates, basically, could, almost, by, default, control, the, market, for, any, number, of, foreign, goods, the, geography, of, the, coastline, made, chasing, pirates, quite, difficult, for, the, authorities, and, private, overseas, trade, began, to, transform, coastal, societies, by, the, 15th, century, as, nearly, all, aspects, of, the, local, society, benefitted, from, or, associated, with, illegal, trade, the, desire, to, trade, for, silver, eventually, led, to, open, conflict, between, the, ming, and, illegal, smugglers, and, pirates, this, conflict, along, with, local, merchants, in, southern, china, helped, persuade, the, ming, court, to, end, the, haijin, ban, on, private, international, trade, in, 1567, pirates, also, projected, local, political, authority, larger, pirate, bands, could, act, as, local, governing, bodies, for, coastal, communities, collecting, taxes, and, engaging, in, protection, schemes, in, addition, to, illegal, goods, pirates, ostensibly, offered, security, to, communities, on, land, in, exchange, for, a, tax, these, bands, also, wrote, and, codified, laws, that, redistributed, wealth, punished, crimes, and, provided, protection, for, the, taxed, community, these, laws, were, strictly, followed, by, the, pirates, as, well, the, political, structures, tended, to, look, similar, to, the, ming, structures, pirates, did, not, tend, to, stay, pirates, permanently, it, seems, to, have, been, relatively, easy, both, to, join, and, leave, a, pirate, band, and, these, raiding, groups, were, more, interested, in, maintaining, a, willing, force, members, of, these, pirate, groups, did, not, tend, to, stay, longer, than, a, few, months, or, years, at, a, time, there, appears, to, have, been, a, hierarchy, in, most, pirate, organizations, pirate, leaders, could, become, very, wealthy, and, powerful, especially, when, working, with, the, chinese, dynasty, and, consequently, so, could, those, who, served, under, them, these, pirate, groups, were, organized, similarly, to, other, escape, societies, throughout, history, and, maintained, a, redistributive, system, to, reward, looting, the, pirates, directly, responsible, for, looting, or, pillaging, got, their, cut, first, and, the, rest, was, allocated, to, the, rest, of, the, pirate, community, there, seems, to, be, evidence, that, there, was, an, egalitarian, aspect, to, these, communities, with, capability, to, do, the, job, being, rewarded, explicitly, the, pirates, themselves, had, some, special, privileges, under, the, law, when, they, interacted, with, communities, on, land, mostly, in, the, form, of, extra, allotments, of, redistributed, wealth, pirates, of, course, had, to, sell, their, loot, they, had, trading, relationships, with, land, communities, and, foreign, traders, in, the, southeastern, regions, of, china, zhu, wan, who, held, the, office, of, grand, coordinator, for, coastal, defense, documented, that, pirates, in, the, region, to, which, he, had, been, sent, had, the, support, of, the, local, elite, gentry, class, these, pirates, in, gowns, and, caps, directly, or, indirectly, sponsored, pirate, activity, and, certainly, directly, benefitted, from, the, illegal, private, trade, in, the, region, when, zhu, wan, or, other, officials, from, the, capital, attempted, to, eliminate, the, pirate, problem, these, local, elites, fought, back, having, zhu, wan, demoted, and, eventually, even, sent, back, to, beijing, to, possibly, be, executed, the, gentry, who, benefitted, from, illegal, maritime, trade, were, too, powerful, and, influential, and, they, were, clearly, very, invested, in, the, smuggling, activities, of, the, pirate, community, in, addition, to, their, relationship, with, the, local, elite, class, on, the, coast, pirates, also, had, complicated, and, often, friendly, relationships, and, partnerships, with, the, dynasty, itself, as, well, as, with, international, traders, when, pirate, groups, recognized, the, authority, of, the, dynasty, they, would, often, be, allowed, to, operate, freely, and, even, profit, from, the, relationship, there, were, also, opportunities, for, these, pirates, to, ally, themselves, with, colonial, projects, from, europe, or, other, overseas, powers, both, the, dynasty, and, foreign, colonial, projects, would, employ, pirates, as, mercenaries, to, establish, dominance, in, the, coastal, region, because, of, how, difficult, it, was, for, established, state, powers, to, control, these, regions, pirates, seem, to, have, had, a, lot, of, freedom, to, choose, their, allies, and, their, preferred, markets, included, in, this, list, of, possible, allies, sea, marauders, and, pirates, even, found, opportunities, to, bribe, military, officials, as, they, engaged, in, illegal, trade, they, seem, to, have, been, incentivized, mostly, by, money, and, loot, and, so, could, afford, to, play, the, field, with, regards, to, their, political, or, military, allies, because, pirate, organizations, could, be, so, powerful, locally, the, ming, government, made, concerted, efforts, to, weaken, them, the, presence, of, colonial, projects, complicated, this, however, as, pirates, could, ally, themselves, with, other, maritime, powers, or, local, elites, to, stay, in, business, the, chinese, government, was, clearly, aware, of, the, power, of, some, of, these, pirate, groups, as, some, documents, even, refer, to, them, as, sea, rebels, a, reference, to, the, political, nature, of, pirates, pirates, like, zheng, zhilong, and, zheng, chenggong, accrued, tremendous, local, power, eventually, even, being, hired, as, naval, commanders, by, the, chinese, dynasties, and, foreign, maritime, powers, bawarij, were, sindhi, pirates, named, for, their, distinctive, barja, warships, who, were, active, between, 251, and, 865, ad, their, frequent, piracy, and, the, incident, in, which, they, looted, two, treasure, ships, coming, from, ceylon, became, the, casus, belli, for, the, umayyad, conquest, of, sindh, pirates, who, accepted, the, royal, pardon, from, the, chola, empire, would, get, to, serve, in, the, chola, navy, as, kallarani, they, would, be, used, as, coast, guards, or, sent, on, recon, missions, to, deal, with, arab, piracy, in, the, arabian, sea, their, function, is, similar, to, the, 18th, century, privateers, used, by, the, royal, navy, starting, in, the, 14th, century, the, deccan, southern, peninsular, region, of, india, was, divided, into, two, entities, on, the, one, side, stood, the, muslim, bahmani, sultanate, and, on, the, other, stood, the, hindu, kings, rallied, around, the, vijayanagara, empire, continuous, wars, demanded, frequent, resupplies, of, fresh, horses, which, were, imported, through, sea, routes, from, persia, and, africa, this, trade, was, subjected, to, frequent, raids, by, thriving, bands, of, pirates, based, in, the, coastal, cities, of, western, india, one, of, such, was, timoji, who, operated, off, anjadip, island, both, as, a, privateer, by, seizing, horse, traders, that, he, rendered, to, the, raja, of, honavar, and, as, a, pirate, who, attacked, the, kerala, merchant, fleets, that, traded, pepper, with, gujarat, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, there, was, frequent, european, piracy, against, mughal, indian, merchants, especially, those, en, route, to, mecca, for, hajj, the, situation, came, to, a, head, when, the, portuguese, attacked, and, captured, the, vessel, rahimi, which, belonged, to, mariam, zamani, the, mughal, queen, which, led, to, the, mughal, seizure, of, the, portuguese, town, daman, in, the, 18th, century, the, famous, maratha, privateer, kanhoji, angre, ruled, the, seas, between, mumbai, and, goa, the, marathas, attacked, british, shipping, and, insisted, that, east, india, company, ships, pay, taxes, if, sailing, through, their, waters, the, southern, coast, of, the, persian, gulf, was, known, to, the, british, from, the, late, 18th, century, as, the, pirate, coast, where, control, of, the, seaways, of, the, persian, gulf, was, asserted, by, the, qawasim, al, qasimi, and, other, local, maritime, powers, memories, of, the, privations, carried, out, on, the, coast, by, portuguese, raiders, under, albuquerque, were, long, and, local, powers, antipathetic, as, a, consequence, to, christian, powers, asserting, dominance, of, their, coastal, waters, early, british, expeditions, to, protect, the, imperial, indian, ocean, trade, from, competitors, principally, the, al, qasimi, from, ras, al, khaimah, and, lingeh, led, to, campaigns, against, those, headquarters, and, other, harbours, along, the, coast, in, 1809, and, then, after, a, relapse, in, raiding, again, in, 1819, this, led, to, the, signing, of, the, first, formal, treaty, of, maritime, peace, between, the, british, and, the, rulers, of, several, coastal, sheikhdoms, in, 1820, this, was, cemented, by, the, treaty, of, maritime, peace, in, perpetuity, in, 1853, resulting, in, the, british, label, for, the, area, pirate, coast, being, softened, to, the, trucial, coast, with, several, emirates, being, recognised, by, the, british, as, trucial, states, at, one, point, there, were, nearly, 1, 000, pirates, located, in, madagascar, le, sainte, marie, was, a, popular, base, for, pirates, throughout, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, most, famous, pirate, utopia, is, that, of, the, probably, fictional, captain, misson, and, his, pirate, crew, who, allegedly, founded, the, free, colony, of, libertatia, in, northern, madagascar, in, the, late, 17th, century, until, it, was, destroyed, in, a, surprise, attack, by, the, island, natives, in, 1694, the, classic, era, of, piracy, in, the, caribbean, lasted, from, circa, 1650, until, the, mid, 1720s, by, 1650, france, england, and, the, united, provinces, began, to, develop, their, colonial, empires, this, involved, considerable, seaborne, trade, and, a, general, economic, improvement, there, was, money, to, be, made, or, stolen, and, much, of, it, traveled, by, ship, french, buccaneers, were, established, on, northern, hispaniola, as, early, as, 1625, but, lived, at, first, mostly, as, hunters, rather, than, robbers, their, transition, to, full, time, piracy, was, gradual, and, motivated, in, part, by, spanish, efforts, to, wipe, out, both, the, buccaneers, and, the, prey, animals, on, which, they, depended, the, buccaneers, migration, from, hispaniola, s, mainland, to, the, more, defensible, offshore, island, of, tortuga, limited, their, resources, and, accelerated, their, piratical, raids, according, to, alexandre, exquemelin, a, buccaneer, and, historian, who, remains, a, major, source, on, this, period, the, tortuga, buccaneer, pierre, le, grand, pioneered, the, settlers, attacks, on, galleons, making, the, return, voyage, to, spain, the, growth, of, buccaneering, on, tortuga, was, augmented, by, the, english, capture, of, jamaica, from, spain, in, 1655, the, early, english, governors, of, jamaica, freely, granted, letters, of, marque, to, tortuga, buccaneers, and, to, their, own, countrymen, while, the, growth, of, port, royal, provided, these, raiders, with, a, far, more, profitable, and, enjoyable, place, to, sell, their, booty, in, the, 1660s, the, new, french, governor, of, tortuga, bertrand, d, ogeron, similarly, provided, privateering, commissions, both, to, his, own, colonists, and, to, english, cutthroats, from, port, royal, these, conditions, brought, caribbean, buccaneering, to, its, zenith, a, new, phase, of, piracy, began, in, the, 1690s, as, english, pirates, began, to, look, beyond, the, caribbean, for, treasure, the, fall, of, britain, s, stuart, kings, had, restored, the, traditional, enmity, between, britain, and, france, thus, ending, the, profitable, collaboration, between, english, jamaica, and, french, tortuga, the, devastation, of, port, royal, by, an, earthquake, in, 1692, further, reduced, the, caribbean, s, attractions, by, destroying, the, pirates, chief, market, for, fenced, plunder, caribbean, colonial, governors, began, to, discard, the, traditional, policy, of, no, peace, beyond, the, line, under, which, it, was, understood, that, war, would, continue, and, thus, letters, of, marque, would, be, granted, in, the, caribbean, regardless, of, peace, treaties, signed, in, europe, henceforth, commissions, would, be, granted, only, in, wartime, and, their, limitations, would, be, strictly, enforced, furthermore, much, of, the, spanish, main, had, simply, been, exhausted, maracaibo, alone, had, been, sacked, three, times, between, 1667, and, 1678, while, r, o, de, la, hacha, had, been, raided, five, times, and, tol, eight, at, the, same, time, england, s, less, favored, colonies, including, bermuda, new, york, and, rhode, island, had, become, cash, starved, by, the, navigation, acts, which, restricted, trade, with, foreign, ships, merchants, and, governors, eager, for, coin, were, willing, to, overlook, and, even, underwrite, pirate, voyages, one, colonial, official, defended, a, pirate, because, he, thought, it, very, harsh, to, hang, people, that, brings, in, gold, to, these, provinces, although, some, of, these, pirates, operating, out, of, new, england, and, the, middle, colonies, targeted, spain, s, remoter, pacific, coast, colonies, well, into, the, 1690s, and, beyond, the, indian, ocean, was, a, richer, and, more, tempting, target, india, s, economic, output, was, large, during, this, time, especially, in, high, value, luxury, goods, like, silk, and, calico, which, made, ideal, pirate, booty, at, the, same, time, no, powerful, navies, plied, the, indian, ocean, leaving, both, local, shipping, and, the, various, east, india, companies, vessels, vulnerable, to, attack, this, set, the, stage, for, the, famous, pirates, thomas, tew, henry, every, robert, culliford, and, although, his, guilt, remains, controversial, william, kidd, in, 1713, and, 1714, a, series, of, peace, treaties, ended, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, as, a, result, thousands, of, seamen, including, european, privateers, who, had, operated, in, the, west, indies, were, relieved, of, military, duty, at, a, time, when, cross, atlantic, colonial, shipping, trade, was, beginning, to, boom, in, addition, european, sailors, who, had, been, pushed, by, unemployment, to, work, onboard, merchantmen, including, slave, ships, were, often, enthusiastic, to, abandon, that, profession, and, turn, to, pirating, giving, pirate, captains, a, steady, pool, of, recruits, from, various, coasts, across, the, atlantic, in, 1715, pirates, launched, a, major, raid, on, spanish, divers, trying, to, recover, gold, from, a, sunken, treasure, galleon, near, florida, the, nucleus, of, the, pirate, force, was, a, group, of, english, ex, privateers, all, of, whom, would, soon, be, enshrined, in, infamy, henry, jennings, charles, vane, samuel, bellamy, and, edward, england, the, attack, was, successful, but, contrary, to, their, expectations, the, governor, of, jamaica, refused, to, allow, jennings, and, their, cohorts, to, spend, their, loot, on, his, island, with, kingston, and, the, declining, port, royal, closed, to, them, jennings, and, his, comrades, founded, a, new, pirate, base, at, nassau, on, the, island, of, new, providence, in, the, bahamas, which, had, been, abandoned, during, the, war, until, the, arrival, of, governor, woodes, rogers, three, years, later, nassau, would, be, home, for, these, pirates, and, their, many, recruits, shipping, traffic, between, africa, the, caribbean, and, europe, began, to, soar, in, the, 18th, century, a, model, that, was, known, as, triangular, trade, and, was, a, rich, target, for, piracy, trade, ships, sailed, from, europe, to, the, african, coast, trading, manufactured, goods, and, weapons, in, exchange, for, slaves, the, traders, would, then, sail, to, the, caribbean, to, sell, the, slaves, and, return, to, europe, with, goods, such, as, sugar, tobacco, and, cocoa, another, triangular, trade, saw, ships, carry, raw, materials, preserved, cod, and, rum, to, europe, where, a, portion, of, the, cargo, would, be, sold, for, manufactured, goods, which, along, with, the, remainder, of, the, original, load, were, transported, to, the, caribbean, where, they, were, exchanged, for, sugar, and, molasses, which, with, some, manufactured, articles, were, borne, to, new, england, ships, in, the, triangular, trade, made, money, at, each, stop, as, part, of, the, peace, settlement, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, britain, obtained, the, asiento, a, spanish, government, contract, to, supply, slaves, to, spain, s, new, world, colonies, providing, british, traders, and, smugglers, more, access, to, the, traditionally, closed, spanish, markets, in, america, this, arrangement, also, contributed, heavily, to, the, spread, of, piracy, across, the, western, atlantic, at, this, time, shipping, to, the, colonies, boomed, simultaneously, with, the, flood, of, skilled, mariners, after, the, war, merchant, shippers, used, the, surplus, of, sailors, labor, to, drive, wages, down, cutting, corners, to, maximize, their, profits, and, creating, unsavory, conditions, aboard, their, vessels, merchant, sailors, suffered, from, mortality, rates, as, high, or, higher, than, the, slaves, being, transported, rediker, 2004, living, conditions, were, so, poor, that, many, sailors, began, to, prefer, a, freer, existence, as, a, pirate, the, increased, volume, of, shipping, traffic, also, could, sustain, a, large, body, of, brigands, preying, upon, it, among, the, most, infamous, caribbean, pirates, of, the, time, were, edward, teach, or, blackbeard, calico, jack, rackham, and, bartholomew, roberts, most, of, these, pirates, were, eventually, hunted, down, by, the, royal, navy, and, killed, or, captured, several, battles, were, fought, between, the, brigands, and, the, colonial, powers, on, both, land, and, sea, piracy, in, the, caribbean, declined, for, the, next, several, decades, after, 1730, but, by, the, 1810s, many, pirates, roamed, the, waters, though, they, were, not, as, bold, or, successful, as, their, predecessors, the, most, successful, pirates, of, the, era, were, jean, lafitte, and, roberto, cofresi, lafitte, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, last, buccaneer, due, to, his, army, of, pirates, and, fleet, of, pirate, ships, which, held, bases, in, and, around, the, gulf, of, mexico, lafitte, and, his, men, participated, in, the, war, of, 1812, battle, of, new, orleans, cofresi, s, base, was, in, mona, island, puerto, rico, from, where, he, disrupted, the, commerce, throughout, the, region, he, became, the, last, major, target, of, the, international, anti, piracy, operations, the, elimination, of, piracy, from, european, waters, expanded, to, the, caribbean, in, the, 18th, century, west, africa, and, north, america, by, the, 1710s, and, by, the, 1720s, even, the, indian, ocean, was, a, difficult, location, for, pirates, to, operate, england, began, to, strongly, turn, against, piracy, at, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, as, it, was, increasingly, damaging, to, the, country, s, economic, and, commercial, prospects, in, the, region, the, piracy, act, 1698, for, the, more, effectual, suppression, of, piracy, made, it, easier, to, capture, try, and, convict, pirates, by, lawfully, enabling, acts, of, piracy, to, be, examined, inquired, of, tried, heard, and, determined, and, adjudged, in, any, place, at, sea, or, upon, the, land, in, any, of, his, majesty, s, islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or, factories, this, effectively, enabled, admirals, to, hold, a, court, session, to, hear, the, trials, of, pirates, in, any, place, they, deemed, necessary, rather, than, requiring, that, the, trial, be, held, in, england, commissioners, of, these, vice, admiralty, courts, were, also, vested, with, full, power, and, authority, to, issue, warrants, summon, the, necessary, witnesses, and, to, do, all, thing, necessary, for, the, hearing, and, final, determination, of, any, case, of, piracy, robbery, or, felony, these, new, and, faster, trials, provided, no, legal, representation, for, the, pirates, and, ultimately, led, in, this, era, to, the, execution, of, 600, pirates, which, represented, approximately, 10, percent, of, the, pirates, active, at, the, time, in, the, caribbean, region, being, an, accessory, to, piracy, was, also, criminalised, under, the, statute, piracy, saw, a, brief, resurgence, between, the, end, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, 1713, and, around, 1720, as, many, unemployed, seafarers, took, to, piracy, as, a, way, to, make, ends, meet, when, a, surplus, of, sailors, after, the, war, led, to, a, decline, in, wages, and, working, conditions, at, the, same, time, one, of, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, utrecht, that, ended, the, war, gave, to, great, britain, s, royal, african, company, and, other, british, slavers, a, thirty, year, asiento, or, contract, to, furnish, african, slaves, to, the, spanish, colonies, providing, british, merchants, and, smugglers, potential, inroads, into, the, traditionally, closed, spanish, markets, in, america, and, leading, to, an, economic, revival, for, the, whole, region, this, revived, caribbean, trade, provided, rich, new, pickings, for, a, wave, of, piracy, also, contributing, to, the, increase, of, caribbean, piracy, at, this, time, was, spain, s, breakup, of, the, english, logwood, settlement, at, campeche, and, the, attractions, of, a, freshly, sunken, silver, fleet, off, the, southern, bahamas, in, 1715, fears, over, the, rising, levels, of, crime, and, piracy, political, discontent, concern, over, crowd, behaviour, at, public, punishments, and, an, increased, determination, by, parliament, to, suppress, piracy, resulted, in, the, piracy, act, of, 1717, and, of, 1721, these, established, a, seven, year, penal, transportation, to, north, america, as, a, possible, punishment, for, those, convicted, of, lesser, felonies, or, as, a, possible, sentence, that, capital, punishment, might, be, commuted, to, by, royal, pardon, in, 1717, a, pardon, was, offered, to, pirates, who, surrendered, to, british, authorities, after, 1720, piracy, in, the, classic, sense, became, extremely, rare, as, increasingly, effective, anti, piracy, measures, were, taken, by, the, royal, navy, making, it, impossible, for, any, pirate, to, pursue, an, effective, career, for, long, by, 1718, the, british, royal, navy, had, approximately, 124, vessels, and, 214, by, 1815, a, big, increase, from, the, two, vessels, england, had, possessed, in, 1670, british, royal, navy, warships, tirelessly, hunted, down, pirate, vessels, and, almost, always, won, these, engagements, many, pirates, did, not, surrender, and, were, killed, at, the, point, of, capture, notorious, pirate, edward, teach, or, blackbeard, was, hunted, down, by, lieutenant, robert, maynard, at, ocracoke, inlet, off, the, coast, of, north, carolina, on, november, 22, 1718, and, killed, his, flagship, was, a, captured, french, slave, ship, known, originally, as, la, concorde, he, renamed, the, frigate, queen, anne, s, revenge, captain, chaloner, ogle, of, hms, swallow, cornered, bartholomew, roberts, in, 1722, at, cape, lopez, and, a, fatal, broadside, from, the, swallow, killed, the, pirate, captain, instantly, roberts, death, shocked, the, pirate, world, as, well, as, the, royal, navy, the, local, merchants, and, civilians, had, thought, him, invincible, and, some, considered, him, a, hero, roberts, death, was, seen, by, many, historians, as, the, end, of, the, golden, age, of, piracy, also, crucial, to, the, end, of, this, era, of, piracy, was, the, loss, of, the, pirates, last, caribbean, safe, haven, at, nassau, in, the, early, 19th, century, piracy, along, the, east, and, gulf, coasts, of, north, america, as, well, as, in, the, caribbean, increased, again, jean, lafitte, was, just, one, of, hundreds, of, pirates, operating, in, american, and, caribbean, waters, between, the, years, of, 1820, and, 1835, the, united, states, navy, repeatedly, engaged, pirates, in, the, caribbean, gulf, of, mexico, and, in, the, mediterranean, cofres, s, el, mosquito, was, disabled, in, a, collaboration, between, spain, and, the, united, states, after, fleeing, for, hours, he, was, ambushed, and, captured, inland, the, united, states, landed, shore, parties, on, several, islands, in, the, caribbean, in, pursuit, of, pirates, cuba, was, a, major, haven, by, the, 1830s, piracy, had, died, out, again, and, the, navies, of, the, region, focused, on, the, slave, trade, about, the, time, of, the, mexican, american, war, in, 1846, the, united, states, navy, had, grown, strong, and, numerous, enough, to, eliminate, the, pirate, threat, in, the, west, indies, by, the, 1830s, ships, had, begun, to, convert, to, steam, propulsion, so, the, age, of, sail, and, the, classical, idea, of, pirates, in, the, caribbean, ended, privateering, similar, to, piracy, continued, as, an, asset, in, war, for, a, few, more, decades, and, proved, to, be, of, some, importance, during, the, naval, campaigns, of, the, american, civil, war, privateering, would, remain, a, tool, of, european, states, until, the, mid, 19th, century, s, declaration, of, paris, but, letters, of, marque, were, given, out, much, more, sparingly, by, governments, and, were, terminated, as, soon, as, conflicts, ended, the, idea, of, no, peace, beyond, the, line, was, a, relic, that, had, no, meaning, by, the, more, settled, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, due, to, the, strategic, situation, of, this, spanish, archipelago, as, a, crossroads, of, maritime, routes, and, commercial, bridge, between, europe, africa, and, america, this, was, one, of, the, places, on, the, planet, with, the, greatest, pirate, presence, in, the, canary, islands, the, following, stand, out, the, attacks, and, continuous, looting, of, berber, english, french, and, dutch, corsairs, sometimes, successful, and, often, a, failure, and, on, the, other, hand, the, presence, of, pirates, and, corsairs, from, this, archipelago, who, made, their, incursions, into, the, caribbean, pirates, and, corsairs, such, as, fran, ois, le, clerc, jacques, de, sores, francis, drake, defeat, in, gran, canaria, pieter, van, der, does, murat, reis, and, horacio, nelson, attacked, the, islands, and, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, santa, cruz, de, tenerife, 1797, among, those, born, in, the, archipelago, stands, out, above, all, amaro, pargo, whom, the, monarch, felipe, v, of, spain, frequently, benefited, in, his, commercial, incursions, and, corsairs, piracy, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, first, became, common, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, as, english, privateers, discharged, after, the, end, of, the, anglo, spanish, war, 1585, 1604, turned, to, piracy, the, most, famous, and, successful, of, these, early, pirates, was, peter, easton, river, piracy, in, late, 18th, mid, 19th, century, america, was, primarily, concentrated, along, the, ohio, river, and, mississippi, river, valleys, in, 1803, at, tower, rock, the, u, s, army, dragoons, possibly, from, the, frontier, army, post, up, river, at, fort, kaskaskia, on, the, illinois, side, opposite, st, louis, raided, and, drove, out, the, river, pirates, stack, island, was, also, associated, with, river, pirates, and, counterfeiters, in, the, late, 1790s, in, 1809, the, last, major, river, pirate, activity, took, place, on, the, upper, mississippi, river, and, river, piracy, in, this, area, came, to, an, abrupt, end, when, a, group, of, flatboatmen, raided, the, island, wiping, out, the, river, pirates, from, 1790, to, 1834, cave, in, rock, was, the, principal, outlaw, lair, and, headquarters, of, river, pirate, activity, in, the, ohio, river, region, from, which, samuel, mason, led, a, gang, of, river, pirates, on, the, ohio, river, river, piracy, continued, on, the, lower, mississippi, river, from, the, early, 1800s, to, the, mid, 1830s, declining, as, a, result, of, direct, military, action, and, local, law, enforcement, and, regulator, vigilante, groups, that, uprooted, and, swept, out, pockets, of, outlaw, resistance, roaring, dan, seavey, was, a, pirate, active, in, the, early, 1900s, in, the, great, lakes, region, pirates, had, a, system, of, hierarchy, on, board, their, ships, determining, how, captured, money, was, distributed, however, pirates, were, more, egalitarian, than, any, other, area, of, employment, at, the, time, in, fact, pirate, quartermasters, were, a, counterbalance, to, the, captain, and, had, the, power, to, veto, his, orders, the, majority, of, plunder, was, in, the, form, of, cargo, and, ship, s, equipment, with, medicines, the, most, highly, prized, a, vessel, s, doctor, s, chest, would, be, worth, anywhere, from, 300, to, 400, or, around, 470, 000, in, today, s, values, jewels, were, common, plunder, but, not, popular, as, they, were, hard, to, sell, and, pirates, unlike, the, public, of, today, had, little, concept, of, their, value, there, is, one, case, recorded, where, a, pirate, was, given, a, large, diamond, worth, a, great, deal, more, than, the, value, of, the, handful, of, small, diamonds, given, to, his, crewmates, as, a, share, he, felt, cheated, and, had, it, broken, up, to, match, what, they, received, spanish, pieces, of, eight, minted, in, mexico, or, seville, were, the, standard, trade, currency, in, the, american, colonies, however, every, colony, still, used, the, monetary, units, of, pounds, shillings, and, pence, for, bookkeeping, while, spanish, german, french, and, portuguese, money, were, all, standard, mediums, of, exchange, as, british, law, prohibited, the, export, of, british, silver, coinage, until, the, exchange, rates, were, standardised, in, the, late, 18th, century, each, colony, legislated, its, own, different, exchange, rates, in, england, 1, piece, of, eight, was, worth, 4s, 3d, while, it, was, worth, 8s, in, new, york, 7s, 6d, in, pennsylvania, and, 6s, 8d, in, virginia, one, 18th, century, english, shilling, was, worth, around, 58, in, modern, currency, so, a, piece, of, eight, could, be, worth, anywhere, from, 246, to, 465, as, such, the, value, of, pirate, plunder, could, vary, considerably, depending, on, who, recorded, it, and, where, ordinary, seamen, received, a, part, of, the, plunder, at, the, captain, s, discretion, but, usually, a, single, share, on, average, a, pirate, could, expect, the, equivalent, of, a, year, s, wages, as, his, share, from, each, ship, captured, while, the, crew, of, the, most, successful, pirates, would, often, each, receive, a, share, valued, at, around, 1, 000, 1, 17, million, at, least, once, in, their, career, one, of, the, larger, amounts, taken, from, a, single, ship, was, that, by, captain, thomas, tew, from, an, indian, merchantman, in, 1692, each, ordinary, seaman, on, his, ship, received, a, share, worth, 3, 000, 3, 5, million, with, officers, receiving, proportionally, larger, amounts, as, per, the, agreed, shares, with, tew, himself, receiving, 2, shares, it, is, known, there, were, actions, with, multiple, ships, captured, where, a, single, share, was, worth, almost, double, this, by, contrast, an, ordinary, seamen, in, the, royal, navy, received, 19s, per, month, to, be, paid, in, a, lump, sum, at, the, end, of, a, tour, of, duty, which, was, around, half, the, rate, paid, in, the, merchant, navy, however, corrupt, officers, would, often, tax, their, crews, wage, to, supplement, their, own, and, the, royal, navy, of, the, day, was, infamous, for, its, reluctance, to, pay, from, this, wage, 6d, per, month, was, deducted, for, the, maintenance, of, greenwich, hospital, with, similar, amounts, deducted, for, the, chatham, chest, the, chaplain, and, surgeon, six, months, pay, was, withheld, to, discourage, desertion, that, this, was, insufficient, incentive, is, revealed, in, a, report, on, proposed, changes, to, the, rn, admiral, nelson, wrote, in, 1803, he, noted, that, since, 1793, more, than, 42, 000, sailors, had, deserted, roughly, half, of, all, rn, crews, were, pressganged, and, these, not, only, received, lower, wages, than, volunteers, but, were, shackled, while, the, vessel, was, docked, and, were, never, permitted, to, go, ashore, until, released, from, service, although, the, royal, navy, suffered, from, many, morale, issues, it, answered, the, question, of, prize, money, via, the, cruizers, and, convoys, act, of, 1708, which, handed, over, the, share, previously, gained, by, the, crown, to, the, captors, of, the, ship, technically, it, was, still, possible, for, the, crown, to, get, the, money, or, a, portion, of, it, but, this, rarely, happened, the, process, of, condemnation, of, a, captured, vessel, and, its, cargo, and, men, was, given, to, the, high, court, of, the, admiralty, and, this, was, the, process, which, remained, in, force, with, minor, changes, throughout, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, even, the, flag, officer, s, share, was, not, quite, straightforward, he, would, only, get, the, full, one, eighth, if, he, had, no, junior, flag, officer, beneath, him, if, this, was, the, case, then, he, would, get, a, third, share, if, he, had, more, than, one, then, he, would, take, one, half, while, the, rest, was, shared, out, equally, there, was, a, great, deal, of, money, to, be, made, in, this, way, the, record, breaker, was, the, capture, of, the, spanish, frigate, hermione, which, was, carrying, treasure, in, 1762, the, value, of, this, was, so, great, that, each, individual, seaman, netted, 485, 1, 4, million, in, 2008, dollars, the, two, captains, responsible, evans, and, pownall, received, 65, 000, each, 188, 4, million, in, january, 1807, the, frigate, caroline, took, the, spanish, san, rafael, which, brought, in, 52, 000, for, her, captain, peter, rainier, who, had, been, only, a, midshipman, some, thirteen, months, before, all, through, the, wars, there, are, examples, of, this, kind, of, luck, falling, on, captains, another, famous, capture, was, that, of, the, spanish, frigates, thetis, and, santa, brigada, which, were, loaded, with, gold, specie, they, were, taken, by, four, british, frigates, who, shared, the, money, each, captain, receiving, 40, 730, each, lieutenant, got, 5, 091, the, warrant, officer, group, 2, 468, the, midshipmen, 791, and, the, individual, seamen, 182, it, should, also, be, noted, that, it, was, usually, only, the, frigates, which, took, prizes, the, ships, of, the, line, were, far, too, ponderous, to, be, able, to, chase, and, capture, the, smaller, ships, which, generally, carried, treasure, nelson, always, bemoaned, that, he, had, done, badly, out, of, prize, money, and, even, as, a, flag, officer, received, little, this, was, not, that, he, had, a, bad, command, of, captains, but, rather, that, british, mastery, of, the, seas, was, so, complete, that, few, enemy, ships, dared, to, sail, even, though, pirates, raided, many, ships, few, if, any, buried, their, treasure, often, the, treasure, that, was, stolen, was, food, water, alcohol, weapons, or, clothing, other, things, they, stole, were, household, items, like, bits, of, soap, and, gear, like, rope, and, anchors, or, sometimes, they, would, keep, the, ship, they, captured, either, to, sell, off, or, keep, because, it, was, better, than, their, ship, such, items, were, likely, to, be, needed, immediately, rather, than, saved, for, future, trade, for, this, reason, there, was, no, need, for, the, pirates, to, bury, these, goods, pirates, tended, to, kill, few, people, aboard, the, ships, they, captured, usually, they, would, kill, no, one, if, the, ship, surrendered, because, if, it, became, known, that, pirates, took, no, prisoners, their, victims, would, fight, to, the, last, breath, and, make, victory, both, very, difficult, and, costly, in, lives, in, contrast, ships, would, quickly, surrender, if, they, knew, they, would, be, spared, in, one, well, documented, case, 300, heavily, armed, soldiers, on, a, ship, attacked, by, thomas, tew, surrendered, after, a, brief, battle, with, none, of, tew, s, 40, man, crew, being, injured, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, once, pirates, were, caught, justice, was, meted, out, in, a, summary, fashion, and, many, ended, their, lives, by, dancing, the, hempen, jig, a, euphemism, for, hanging, public, execution, was, a, form, of, entertainment, at, the, time, and, people, came, out, to, watch, them, as, they, would, to, a, sporting, event, today, newspapers, reported, details, such, as, condemned, men, s, last, words, the, prayers, said, by, the, priests, and, descriptions, of, their, final, moments, in, the, gallows, in, england, most, of, these, executions, took, place, at, execution, dock, on, the, river, thames, in, london, in, the, cases, of, more, famous, prisoners, usually, captains, their, punishments, extended, beyond, death, their, bodies, were, enclosed, in, iron, cages, gibbet, for, which, they, were, measured, before, their, execution, and, left, to, swing, in, the, air, until, the, flesh, rotted, off, them, a, process, that, could, take, as, long, as, two, years, the, bodies, of, captains, such, as, william, captain, kidd, charles, vane, william, fly, and, jack, rackham, calico, jack, were, all, treated, this, manner, while, piracy, was, predominantly, a, male, occupation, throughout, history, a, minority, of, pirates, were, female, pirates, did, not, allow, women, onto, their, ships, very, often, additionally, women, were, often, regarded, as, bad, luck, among, pirates, it, was, feared, that, the, male, members, of, the, crew, would, argue, and, fight, over, the, women, on, many, ships, women, as, well, as, young, boys, were, prohibited, by, the, ship, s, contract, which, all, crew, members, were, required, to, sign, 303, because, of, the, resistance, to, allowing, women, on, board, many, female, pirates, did, not, identify, themselves, as, such, anne, bonny, for, example, dressed, and, acted, as, a, man, while, on, captain, calico, jack, s, ship, 285, she, and, mary, read, another, female, pirate, are, often, identified, as, being, unique, in, this, regard, however, it, is, possible, many, women, dressed, as, men, during, the, golden, age, of, piracy, in, an, effort, to, take, advantage, of, the, many, rights, privileges, and, freedoms, that, were, exclusive, to, men, unlike, traditional, western, societies, of, the, time, many, caribbean, pirate, crews, of, european, descent, operated, as, limited, democracies, pirate, communities, were, some, of, the, first, to, instate, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, similar, to, the, one, used, by, the, present, day, democracies, the, first, record, of, such, a, government, aboard, a, pirate, sloop, dates, to, the, 17th, century, as, recorded, by, captain, charles, johnson, regarding, the, articles, of, bartholomew, roberts, to, date, the, following, identifiable, pirate, shipwrecks, have, been, discovered, a, privateer, or, corsair, used, similar, methods, to, a, pirate, but, acted, under, orders, of, the, state, while, in, possession, of, a, commission, or, letter, of, marque, and, reprisal, from, a, government, or, monarch, authorizing, the, capture, of, merchant, ships, belonging, to, an, enemy, nation, for, example, the, united, states, constitution, of, 1787, specifically, authorized, congress, to, issue, letters, of, marque, and, reprisal, the, letter, of, marque, and, reprisal, was, recognized, by, international, convention, and, meant, that, a, privateer, could, not, technically, be, charged, with, piracy, while, attacking, the, targets, named, in, his, commission, this, nicety, of, law, did, not, always, save, the, individuals, concerned, however, since, whether, one, was, considered, a, pirate, or, a, legally, operating, privateer, often, depended, on, whose, custody, the, individual, found, himself, in, that, of, the, country, that, had, issued, the, commission, or, that, of, the, object, of, attack, spanish, authorities, were, known, to,

bounds, of, their, letters, of, marque, by, attacking, nations, with, which, their, sovereign, was, at, peace, thomas, tew, and, william, kidd, are, notable, alleged, examples, and, thus, made, themselves, liable, to, conviction, for, piracy, however, a, letter, of, marque, did, provide, some, cover, for, such, pirates, as, plunder, seized, from, neutral, or, friendly, shipping, could, be, passed, off, later, as, taken, from, enemy, merchants, the, famous, barbary, corsairs, of, the, mediterranean, authorized, by, the, ottoman, empire, were, privateers, as, were, the, maltese, corsairs, who, were, authorized, by, the, knights, of, st, john, and, the, dunkirkers, in, the, service, of, the, spanish, empire, in, the, years, 1626, 1634, alone, the, dunkirk, privateers, captured, 1, 499,

harassed, union, merchant, ships, privateering, lost, international, sanction, under, the, declaration, of, paris, in, 1856, a, wartime, activity, similar, to, piracy, involves, disguised, warships, called, commerce, raiders, or, merchant, raiders, which, attack, enemy, shipping, commerce, approaching, by, stealth, and, then, opening, fire, commerce, raiders, operated, successfully, during, the, american, revolution, during, the, american, civil, war, the, confederacy, sent, out, several, commerce, raiders, the, most, famous, of, which, was, the, css, alabama, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, germany, also, made, use, of, these, tactics, both, in, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, since, commissioned, naval, vessels, were, openly, used, these, commerce, raiders, should, not, be, considered, even, privateers, much, less, pirates, although, the, opposing, combatants, were, vocal, in, denouncing, them, as, such, seaborne, piracy, against, transport, vessels, is, a, significant, issue, with, estimated, worldwide, losses, of, us, 16, billion, per, year, in, 2004, increased, to, us, 25, billion, over, the, next, 20, years, waters, between, the, red, sea, and, indian, ocean, off, the, somali, coast, and, also, in, the, strait, of, malacca, and, singapore, which, are, used, by, over, 50, 000, commercial, ships, a, year, in, the, gulf, of, guinea, maritime, piracy, has, also, led, to, pressure, on, offshore, oil, and, gas, production, providing, security, for, offshore, installations, and, supply, vessels, is, often, paid, for, by, oil, companies, rather, than, the, respective, governments, in, the, late, 2000s, the, emergence, of, piracy, off, the, coast, of, somalia, spurred, a, multi, national, effort, led, by, the, united, states, to, patrol, the, waters, near, the, horn, of, africa, in, 2011, brazil, also, created, an, anti, piracy, unit, on, the, amazon, river, sir, peter, blake, a, new, zealand, world, champion, yachtsman, was, killed, by, pirates, on, the, amazon, river, in, 2001, river, piracy, happens, in, europe, with, vessels, suffering, from, pirate, attacks, on, the, serbian, and, romanian, stretches, of, the, international, danube, river, i, e, inside, the, european, union, s, territory, modern, pirates, favor, small, boats, and, taking, advantage, of, the, small, number, of, crew, members, on, modern, cargo, vessels, they, also, use, large, vessels, to, supply, the, smaller, attack, boarding, vessels, modern, pirates, can, be, successful, because, a, large, amount, of, international, commerce, occurs, via, shipping, major, shipping, routes, take, cargo, ships, through, narrow, bodies, of, water, such, as, the, gulf, of, aden, and, the, strait, of, malacca, making, them, vulnerable, to, be, overtaken, and, boarded, by, small, motorboats, other, active, areas, include, the, south, china, sea, and, the, niger, delta, as, usage, increases, many, of, these, ships, have, to, lower, cruising, speeds, to, allow, for, navigation, and, traffic, control, making, them, prime, targets, for, piracy, also, pirates, often, operate, in, regions, of, poor, developing, or, struggling, countries, with, small, or, nonexistent, navies, and, large, trade, routes, pirates, sometimes, evade, capture, by, sailing, into, waters, controlled, by, their, pursuer, s, enemies, with, the, end, of, the, cold, war, navies, have, decreased, in, size, and, patrol, less, frequently, while, trade, has, increased, making, organized, piracy, far, easier, modern, pirates, are, sometimes, linked, with, organized, crime, syndicates, but, often, are, small, individual, groups, the, international, maritime, bureau, imb, maintains, statistics, regarding, pirate, attacks, dating, back, to, 1995, their, records, indicate, hostage, taking, overwhelmingly, dominates, the, types, of, violence, against, seafarers, for, example, in, 2006, there, were, 239, attacks, 77, crew, members, were, kidnapped, and, 188, taken, hostage, but, only, 15, of, the, pirate, attacks, resulted, in, murder, in, 2007, the, attacks, rose, by, 10, percent, to, 263, attacks, there, was, a, 35, percent, increase, on, reported, attacks, involving, guns, crew, members, that, were, injured, numbered, 64, compared, to, just, 17, in, 2006, that, number, does, not, include, instances, of, hostage, taking, and, kidnapping, where, the, victims, were, not, injured, the, number, of, attacks, from, january, to, september, 2009, had, surpassed, the, previous, year, s, total, due, to, the, increased, pirate, attacks, in, the, gulf, of, aden, and, off, somalia, between, january, and, september, the, number, of, attacks, rose, to, 306, from, 293, pirates, boarded, the, vessels, in, 114, cases, and, hijacked, 34, of, them, gun, use, in, pirate, attacks, increased, to, 176, cases, from, 76, in, 2008, rather, than, cargo, modern, pirates, have, targeted, the, personal, belongings, of, the, crew, and, the, contents, of, the, ship, s, safe, which, potentially, contains, large, amounts, of, cash, needed, for, payroll, and, port, fees, in, other, cases, the, pirates, force, the, crew, off, the, ship, and, then, sail, it, to, a, port, to, be, repainted, and, given, a, new, identity, through, false, papers, purchased, from, corrupt, or, complicit, officials, modern, piracy, can, take, place, in, conditions, of, political, unrest, for, example, following, the, u, s, withdrawal, from, vietnam, thai, piracy, was, aimed, at, the, many, vietnamese, who, took, to, boats, to, escape, further, following, the, disintegration, of, the, government, of, somalia, warlords, in, the, region, have, attacked, ships, delivering, un, food, aid, the, attack, against, the, german, built, cruise, ship, the, seabourn, spirit, offshore, of, somalia, in, november, 2005, is, an, example, of, the, sophisticated, pirates, mariners, face, the, pirates, carried, out, their, attack, more, than, 100, miles, 160, km, offshore, with, speedboats, launched, from, a, larger, mother, ship, the, attackers, were, armed, with, automatic, firearms, and, an, rpg, since, 2008, somali, pirates, centered, in, the, gulf, of, aden, made, about, 120, million, annually, reportedly, costing, the, shipping, industry, between, 900, million, and, 3, 3, billion, per, year, by, september, 2012, the, heyday, of, piracy, in, the, indian, ocean, was, reportedly, over, backers, were, now, reportedly, reluctant, to, finance, pirate, expeditions, due, to, the, low, rate, of, success, and, pirates, were, no, longer, able, to, reimburse, their, creditors, according, to, the, international, maritime, bureau, pirate, attacks, had, by, october, 2012, dropped, to, a, six, year, low, only, five, ships, were, captured, by, the, end, of, the, year, representing, a, decrease, from, 25, in, 2011, and, 27, in, 2010, with, only, one, ship, attacked, in, the, third, quarter, compared, to, 36, during, the, same, period, in, 2011, however, pirate, incidents, off, on, the, west, african, seaboard, increased, to, 34, from, 30, the, previous, year, and, attacks, off, the, coast, of, indonesia, rose, from, 2011, s, total, of, 46, to, 51, many, nations, forbid, ships, to, enter, their, territorial, waters, or, ports, if, the, crew, of, the, ships, are, armed, in, an, effort, to, restrict, possible, piracy, shipping, companies, sometimes, hire, private, armed, security, guards, modern, definitions, of, piracy, include, the, following, acts, together, with, treason, and, counterfeiting, piracy, including, acts, against, the, law, of, nations, is, one, of, three, criminal, offenses, against, which, the, united, states, congress, is, delegated, power, to, enact, penal, legislation, by, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, in, modern, times, ships, and, airplanes, are, hijacked, for, political, reasons, as, well, the, perpetrators, of, these, acts, could, be, described, as, pirates, for, instance, the, french, term, for, plane, hijacker, is, pirate, de, l, air, literally, air, pirate, but, in, english, are, usually, termed, hijackers, an, example, is, the, hijacking, of, the, italian, civilian, passenger, ship, achille, lauro, by, the, palestinian, liberation, organization, in, 1985, which, is, regarded, as, an, act, of, piracy, a, 2009, book, entitled, international, legal, dimension, of, terrorism, called, the, attackers, terrorists, modern, pirates, also, use, a, great, deal, of, technology, it, has, been, reported, that, crimes, of, piracy, have, involved, the, use, of, mobile, phones, satellite, phones, gps, machetes, ak74, rifles, sonar, systems, modern, speedboats, shotguns, pistols, mounted, machine, guns, and, even, rpgs, and, grenade, launchers, in, 2020, the, amount, of, piracy, increased, by, 24, after, being, at, its, lowest, 21st, century, level, in, 2019, the, americas, and, africa, have, been, identified, by, the, international, chamber, of, commerce, as, the, most, vulnerable, to, piracy, as, a, result, of, less, wealthy, governments, in, the, regions, being, unable, to, adequately, combat, piracy, imb, piracy, reporting, centre, keeps, a, live, piracy, map, to, help, keep, track, of, all, recent, piracy, and, armed, robbery, incidents, under, a, principle, of, international, law, known, as, the, universality, principle, a, government, may, exercise, jurisdiction, over, conduct, outside, its, territory, if, that, conduct, is, universally, dangerous, to, states, and, their, nationals, the, rationale, behind, the, universality, principle, is, that, states, will, punish, certain, acts, wherever, they, may, occur, as, a, means, of, protecting, the, global, community, as, a, whole, even, absent, a, link, between, the, state, and, the, parties, or, the, acts, in, question, under, this, principle, the, concept, of, universal, jurisdiction, applies, to, the, crime, of, piracy, for, example, the, united, states, has, a, statute, section, 1651, of, title, 18, of, the, united, states, code, imposing, a, sentence, of, life, in, prison, for, piracy, as, defined, by, the, law, of, nations, committed, anywhere, on, the, high, seas, regardless, of, the, nationality, of, the, pirates, or, the, victims, the, goal, of, maritime, security, operations, is, actively, to, deter, disrupt, and, suppress, piracy, in, order, to, protect, global, maritime, security, and, secure, freedom, of, navigation, for, the, benefit, of, all, nations, and, pirates, are, often, detained, interrogated, disarmed, and, released, with, millions, of, dollars, at, stake, pirates, have, little, incentive, to, stop, in, finland, one, case, involved, pirates, who, had, been, captured, and, whose, boat, was, sunk, as, the, pirates, attacked, a, vessel, of, singapore, not, finland, and, are, not, themselves, eu, or, finnish, citizens, they, were, not, prosecuted, a, further, complication, in, many, cases, including, this, one, is, that, many, countries, do, not, allow, extradition, of, people, to, jurisdictions, where, they, may, be, sentenced, to, death, or, torture, the, dutch, are, using, a, 17th, century, law, against, sea, robbery, to, prosecute, warships, that, capture, pirates, have, no, jurisdiction, to, try, them, and, nato, does, not, have, a, detention, policy, in, place, prosecutors, have, a, hard, time, assembling, witnesses, and, finding, translators, and, countries, are, reluctant, to, imprison, pirates, because, the, countries, would, be, saddled, with, the, pirates, upon, their, release, the, regional, cooperation, agreement, on, combating, piracy, and, armed, robbery, against, ships, in, asia, formed, in, november, 2006, since, the, 2010s, the, u, s, navy, and, others, have, been, developing, artificial, intelligence, ai, based, systems, that, generate, piracy, alerts, based, on, surveillance, data, the, fourth, volume, of, the, handbook, best, management, practices, to, deter, piracy, off, the, coast, of, somalia, and, in, the, arabian, sea, area, known, as, bmp4, is, the, current, authoritative, guide, for, merchant, ships, on, self, defense, against, pirates, the, guide, is, issued, and, updated, by, oil, companies, international, marine, forum, ocimf, a, consortium, of, interested, international, shipping, and, trading, organizations, including, the, eu, nato, and, the, international, maritime, bureau, it, is, distributed, primarily, by, the, maritime, security, centre, horn, of, africa, mschoa, the, planning, and, coordination, authority, for, eu, naval, forces, eunavfor, the, bmp4, encourages, vessels, to, register, their, voyages, through, the, region, with, mschoa, as, this, registration, is, a, key, component, of, the, operation, of, the, international, recommended, transit, corridor, irtc, the, navy, patrolled, route, through, the, gulf, of, aden, the, bmp4, contains, a, chapter, entitled, self, protective, measures, which, lays, out, a, list, of, steps, a, merchant, vessel, can, take, to, make, itself, less, of, a, target, to, pirates, and, make, it, better, able, to, repel, an, attack, if, one, occurs, this, list, includes, rigging, the, deck, of, the, ship, with, razor, wire, rigging, fire, hoses, to, spray, sea, water, over, the, side, of, the, ship, to, hinder, boardings, having, a, distinctive, pirate, alarm, hardening, the, bridge, against, gunfire, and, creating, a, citadel, where, the, crew, can, retreat, if, pirates, get, on, board, other, unofficial, self, defense, measures, that, can, be, found, on, merchant, vessels, include, the, setting, up, of, mannequins, posing, as, armed, guards, or, firing, flares, at, the, pirates, though, it, varies, by, country, generally, peacetime, law, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, has, not, allowed, merchant, vessels, to, carry, weapons, as, a, response, to, the, rise, in, modern, piracy, however, the, u, s, government, changed, its, rules, so, that, it, is, now, possible, for, u, s, flagged, vessels, to, embark, a, team, of, armed, private, security, guards, the, us, coastguard, leaves, it, to, ship, owners, discretion, to, determine, if, those, guards, will, be, armed, the, international, chamber, of, shipping, ics, in, 2011, changed, its, stance, on, private, armed, guards, accepting, that, operators, must, be, able, to, defend, their, ships, against, pirate, attacks, this, has, given, birth, to, a, new, breed, of, private, security, companies, that, provide, training, for, crew, members, and, operate, floating, armouries, for, protection, of, crew, and, cargo, this, has, proved, effective, in, countering, pirate, attacks, the, use, of, floating, armouries, in, international, waters, allows, ships, to, carry, weapons, in, international, waters, without, being, in, possession, of, arms, within, coastal, waters, where, they, would, be, illegal, seychelles, has, become, a, central, location, for, international, anti, piracy, operations, hosting, the, anti, piracy, operation, center, for, the, indian, ocean, in, 2008, vsos, became, the, first, authorized, armed, maritime, security, company, to, operate, in, the, indian, ocean, region, with, safety, trials, complete, in, the, late, 2000s, laser, dazzlers, have, been, developed, for, defensive, purposes, on, super, yachts, they, can, be, effective, up, to, 4, kilometres, 2, 5, mi, with, the, effects, going, from, mild, disorientation, to, flash, blindness, at, closer, range, in, february, 2012, italian, marines, based, on, the, tanker, enrica, lexie, allegedly, fired, on, an, indian, fishing, trawler, off, kerala, killing, two, of, her, eleven, crew, the, marines, allegedly, mistook, the, fishing, vessel, as, a, pirate, vessel, the, incident, sparked, a, diplomatic, row, between, india, and, italy, enrica, lexie, was, ordered, into, kochi, where, her, crew, were, questioned, by, officers, of, the, indian, police, the, fact, is, still, sub, juris, and, its, legal, eventual, outcome, could, influence, future, deployment, of, vpds, since, states, will, be, either, encouraged, or, discouraged, to, provide, them, depending, on, whether, functional, immunity, is, ultimately, granted, or, denied, to, the, italians, another, similar, incident, has, been, reported, to, have, happened, in, the, red, sea, between, the, coasts, of, somalia, and, yemen, involving, the, death, of, a, yemeni, fisherman, allegedly, at, the, hands, of, a, russian, vessel, protection, detachment, vpd, on, board, a, norwegian, flagged, vessel, despite, vpd, deployment, being, controversial, because, of, these, incidents, according, to, the, associated, press, during, a, united, nations, security, council, conference, about, piracy, u, s, ambassador, susan, rice, told, the, council, that, no, ship, carrying, armed, guards, has, been, successfully, attacked, by, pirates, and, french, ambassador, gerard, araud, stressed, that, private, guards, do, not, have, the, deterrent, effect, that, government, posted, marine, and, sailors, and, naval, patrols, have, in, warding, off, attacks, the, best, protection, against, pirates, is, to, avoid, encountering, them, this, can, be, accomplished, by, using, tools, such, as, radar, or, by, using, specialised, systems, that, use, shorter, wavelengths, as, small, boats, are, not, always, picked, up, by, radar, an, example, of, a, specialised, system, is, watchstander, while, the, non, wartime, 20th, century, tradition, has, been, for, merchant, vessels, not, to, be, armed, the, u, s, government, has, recently, changed, the, rules, so, that, it, is, now, best, practice, for, vessels, to, embark, a, team, of, armed, private, security, guards, the, guards, are, usually, supplied, from, ships, intended, specifically, for, training, and, supplying, such, armed, personnel, the, crew, can, be, given, weapons, training, and, warning, shots, can, be, fired, legally, in, international, waters, other, measures, vessels, can, take, to, protect, themselves, against, piracy, are, air, pressurised, boat, stopping, systems, which, can, fire, a, variety, of, vessel, disabling, projectiles, implementing, a, high, freewall, and, vessel, boarding, protection, systems, e, g, hot, water, wall, electricity, charged, water, wall, automated, fire, monitor, slippery, foam, ships, can, also, attempt, to, protect, themselves, using, their, automatic, identification, systems, ais, every, ship, over, 300, tons, carries, a, transponder, supplying, both, information, about, the, ship, itself, and, its, movements, any, unexpected, change, in, this, information, can, attract, attention, previously, this, data, could, only, be, picked, up, if, there, was, a, nearby, ship, rendering, single, ships, vulnerable, special, satellites, have, been, launched, recently, that, are, now, able, to, detect, and, retransmit, this, data, large, ships, cannot, therefore, be, hijacked, without, being, detected, this, can, act, as, a, deterrent, to, attempts, to, either, hijack, the, entire, ship, or, steal, large, portions, of, cargo, with, another, ship, since, an, escort, can, be, sent, more, quickly, in, an, emergency, warships, can, be, called, upon, in, some, areas, such, as, near, somalia, patrolling, naval, vessels, from, different, nations, are, available, to, intercept, vessels, attacking, merchant, vessels, for, patrolling,
