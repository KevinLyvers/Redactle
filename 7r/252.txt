tanzania, swahili, and, english, the, maasai, population, has, been, reported, as, numbering, 1, 189, 522, in, kenya, in, the, 2019, census, compared, to, 377, 089, in, the, 1989, census, though, many, maasai, view, the, census, as, government, meddling, and, therefore, either, refuse, to, participate, or, actively, provide, false, information, the, maasai, inhabit, the, african, great, lakes, region, and, arrived, via, south, sudan, most, nilotic, speakers, in, the, area, including, the, maasai, the, turkana, and, the, kalenjin, are, pastoralists, and, have, a, reputation, as, fearsome, warriors, and, cattle, rustlers, the, maasai, and, other, groups, in, east, africa, have, adopted, customs, and, practices, from, neighbouring, cushitic, speaking, groups, including, the, age, set, system, of, social, organisation, circumcision, and, vocabulary, terms, many, ethnic, groups, that, had, already, formed, settlements, in, the, region, were, forcibly, displaced, by, the, incoming, maasai, other, mainly, southern, cushitic, groups, were, assimilated, into, maasai, society, the, nilotic, ancestors, of, the, kalenjin, likewise, absorbed, some, early, cushitic, populations, the, maasai, territory, reached, its, largest, size, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, covered, almost, all, of, the, great, rift, valley, and, adjacent, lands, from, mount, marsabit, in, the, north, to, dodoma, in, the, south, at, this, time, the, maasai, as, well, as, the, larger, nilotic, group, they, were, part, of, raised, cattle, as, far, east, as, the, tanga, coast, in, tanganyika, now, mainland, tanzania, raiders, used, spears, and, shields, but, were, most, feared, for, throwing, clubs, orinka, which, could, be, accurately, thrown, from, up, to, 70, paces, approx, 100, metres, in, 1852, there, was, a, report, of, a, concentration, of, 800, maasai, warriors, on, the, move, in, what, is, now, kenya, in, 1857, after, having, depopulated, the, wakuafi, wilderness, in, what, is, now, southeastern, kenya, maasai, warriors, threatened, mombasa, on, the, kenyan, coast, because, of, this, migration, the, maasai, are, the, southernmost, nilotic, speakers, the, period, of, expansion, was, followed, by, the, maasai, emutai, of, 1883, 1902, this, period, was, marked, by, epidemics, of, contagious, bovine, pleuropneumonia, rinderpest, see, 1890s, african, rinderpest, epizootic, and, smallpox, the, estimate, first, put, forward, by, a, german, lieutenant, in, what, was, then, northwest, tanganyika, was, that, 90, of, cattle, and, half, of, wild, animals, perished, from, rinderpest, german, doctors, in, the, same, area, claimed, that, every, second, african, had, a, pock, marked, face, as, the, result, of, smallpox, this, period, coincided, with, drought, rains, failed, in, 1897, and, 1898, the, austrian, explorer, oscar, baumann, travelled, in, maasai, lands, between, 1891, and, 1893, and, described, the, old, maasai, settlement, in, the, ngorongoro, crater, in, the, 1894, book, durch, massailand, zur, nilquelle, through, the, lands, of, the, maasai, to, the, source, of, the, nile, by, one, estimate, two, thirds, of, the, maasai, died, during, this, period, maasai, in, tanganyika, now, mainland, tanzania, were, displaced, from, the, fertile, lands, between, mount, meru, and, mount, kilimanjaro, and, most, of, the, fertile, highlands, near,

the, possible, background, of, modern, maasai, the, maasai, s, autosomal, dna, has, been, examined, in, a, comprehensive, study, by, tishkoff, et, al, 2009, on, the, genetic, affiliations, of, various, populations, in, africa, according, to, the, study, s, authors, the, maasai, have, maintained, their, culture, in, the, face, of, extensive, genetic, introgression, tishkoff, et, al, also, indicate, that, many, nilo, saharan, speaking, populations, in, east, africa, such, as, the, maasai, show, multiple, cluster, assignments, from, the, nilo, saharan, and, cushitic, aacs, in, accord, with, linguistic, evidence, of, repeated, nilotic, assimilation, of, cushites, over, the, past, 3000, years, and, with, the, high, frequency, of, a, shared, east, african, specific, mutation,

populations, of, the, horn, of, africa, specifically, among, amharas, genetic, data, and, archeologic, evidence, suggest, that, east, african, pastoralists, received, west, eurasian, ancestry, 25, through, afroasiatic, speaking, groups, from, northern, africa, or, the, arabian, peninsula, and, later, spread, this, ancestry, component, southwards, into, certain, khoisan, groups, roughly, 2, 000, years, ago, resulting, in, 5, west, eurasian, ancestry, among, southern, african, hunter, gatherers, a, 2019, archaeogenetic, study, sampled, ancient, remains, from, neolithic, inhabitants, of,

men, who, possess, the, haplogroup, at, high, frequencies, lived, more, than, 13, 000, years, ago, the, second, most, frequent, paternal, lineage, among, the, maasai, was, haplogroup, a3b2, which, is, commonly, found, in, nilotic, populations, such, as, the, alur, it, was, observed, in, 27, of, maasai, men, the, third, most, frequently, observed, paternal, dna, marker, in, the, maasai, was, e1b1a1, m2, e, p1, which, is, very, common, in, the, sub, saharan, region, it, was, found, in, 12, of, the, maasai, samples, haplogroup, b, m60, was, also, observed, in, 8, of, the, studied, maasai, which, is, also, found, in, 30, 16, 53, of, southern, sudanese, nilotes, according, to, an, mtdna, study, by, castri, et, al, 2008, which, tested, maasai, individuals, in, kenya, the, maternal, lineages, found, among, the, maasai, are, quite, diverse, but, similar, in, overall, frequency, to, that, observed, in, other, nilo, hamitic, populations, from, the, region, such, as, the, samburu, most, of, the, tested, maasai, belonged, to, various, macro, haplogroup, l, sub, clades, including, l0, l2, l3, l4, and, l5, some, maternal, gene, flow, from, north, and, northeast, africa, was, also, reported, particularly, via, the, presence, of, mtdna, haplogroup, m, lineages, in, about, 12, 5, of, the, maasai, samples, the, monotheistic, maasai, worship, a, single, deity, called, enkai, nkai, or, engai,

seen, from, lake, natron, in, southernmost, kenya, the, central, human, figure, in, the, maasai, religious, system, is, the, laibon, whose, roles, include, shamanistic, healing, divination, and, prophecy, and, ensuring, success, in, war, or, adequate, rainfall, today, they, have, a, political, role, as, well, due, to, the, elevation, of, leaders, whatever, power, an, individual, laibon, had,

blood, from, a, slaughtered, ox, traditional, maasai, lifestyle, centres, around, their, cattle, which, constitute, their, primary, source, of, food, in, a, patriarchal, culture, that, views, women, as, property, a, man, s, wealth, is, measured, in, cattle, wives, and, children, a, herd, of, 50, cattle, is, respectable, and, the, more, wives, and, children, the, better, a, man, who, has, plenty, of, one, but, not, the, other, is, considered, to, be, poor, all, of, the, maasai, s, needs, for, food, are, met, by, their, cattle, they, eat, their, meat, drink, their, milk, daily, and, drink, their, blood, on, occasion, bulls, goats, and, lambs, are, slaughtered, for, meat, on, special, occasions, and, ceremonies, though, the, maasai, s, entire, way, of, life, has, historically, depended, on, their, cattle, more, recently, with, their, cattle, dwindling, the, maasai, have, grown, dependent, on, food, such, as, sorghum, rice, potatoes, and, cabbage, known, to, the, maasai, as, goat, leaves, one, common, misconception, about, the, maasai, is, that, each, young, man, is, supposed, to, kill, a, lion, before, he, can, be, circumcised, and, enter, adulthood, lion, hunting, was, an, activity, of, the, past, but, it, has, been, banned, in, east, africa, yet, lions, are, still, hunted, when, they, maul, maasai, livestock, nevertheless, killing, a, lion, gives, one, great, value, and, celebrity, status, in, the, community, the, piercing, and, stretching, of, earlobes, are, common, among, the, maasai, as, with, other, tribes, and, both, men, and, women, wear, metal, hoops, on,

then, into, early, arranged, marriages, the, maasai, believe, that, female, genital, mutilation, is, necessary, and, maasai, men, may, reject, any, woman, who, has, not, undergone, it, as, either, not, marriageable, or, worthy, of, a, much, reduced, bride, price, in, eastern, africa, uncircumcised, women, even, highly, educated, members, of, parliament, like, linah, kilimo, can, be, accused, of, not, being, mature, enough, to, be, taken, seriously, the, maasai, activist, agnes, pareyio, campaigns, against, the, practice, the, female, rite, of, passage, ritual, has, recently, seen,
