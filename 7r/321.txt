the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, is, an, alphabetic, system, of, phonetic, notation, based, primarily, on, the, latin, script, it, was, devised, by, the, international, phonetic, association, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, a, standard, written, representation, for, the, sounds, of, speech, the, ipa, is, used, by, lexicographers, foreign, language, students, and, teachers, linguists, speech, language, pathologists, singers, actors, constructed, language, creators, and, translators, the, ipa, is, designed, to, represent, those, qualities, of, speech, that, are, part, of, lexical, and, to, a, limited, extent, prosodic, sounds, in, oral, language, phones, intonation, and, the, separation, of, syllables, to, represent, additional, qualities, of, speech, such, as, tooth, gnashing, lisping, and, sounds, made, with, a, cleft, palate, an, extended, set, of, symbols, may, be, used, segments, are, transcribed, by, one, or, more, ipa, symbols, of, two, basic, types, letters, and, diacritics, for, example, the, sound, of, the, english, digraph, ch, may, be, transcribed, in, ipa, with, a, single, letter, or, with, multiple, letters, plus, diacritics, depending, on, how, precise, one, wishes, to, be, slashes, are, used, to, signal, phonemic, transcription, therefore, t, is, more, abstract, than, either, or, and, might, refer, to, either, depending, on, the, context, and, language, occasionally, letters, or, diacritics, are, added, removed, or, modified, by, the, international, phonetic, association, as, of, the, most, recent, change, in, 2005, there, are, 107, segmental, letters, an, indefinitely, large, number, of, suprasegmental, letters, 44, diacritics, not, counting, composites, and, four, extra, lexical, prosodic, marks, in, the, ipa, these, are, illustrated, in, the, current, ipa, chart, posted, below, in, this, article, and, on, the, international, phonetic, association, s, website, in, 1886, a, group, of, french, and, english, language, teachers, led, by, the, french, linguist, paul, passy, formed, what, would, be, known, from, 1897, onwards, as, the, international, phonetic, association, in, french, l, association, phon, tique, internationale, their, original, alphabet, was, based, on, a, spelling, reform, for, english, known, as, the, romic, alphabet, but, to, make, it, usable, for, other, languages, the, values, of, the, symbols, were, allowed, to, vary, from, language, to, language, for, example, the, sound, the, sh, in, shoe, was, originally, represented, with, the, letter, c, in, english, but, with, the, digraph, ch, in, french, in, 1888, the, alphabet, was, revised, to, be, uniform, across, languages, thus, providing, the, base, for, all, future, revisions, the, idea, of, making, the, ipa, was, first, suggested, by, otto, jespersen, in, a, letter, to, passy, it, was, developed, by, alexander, john, ellis, henry, sweet, daniel, jones, and, passy, since, its, creation, the, ipa, has, undergone, a, number, of, revisions, after, revisions, and, expansions, from, the, 1890s, to, the, 1940s, the, ipa, remained, primarily, unchanged, until, the, kiel, convention, in, 1989, a, minor, revision, took, place, in, 1993, with, the, addition, of, four, letters, for, mid, central, vowels, and, the, removal, of, letters, for, voiceless, implosives, the, alphabet, was, last, revised, in, may, 2005, with, the, addition, of, a, letter, for, a, labiodental, flap, apart, from, the, addition, and, removal, of, symbols, changes, to, the, ipa, have, consisted, largely, of, renaming, symbols, and, categories, and, in, modifying, typefaces, extensions, to, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, for, speech, pathology, extipa, were, created, in, 1990, and, were, officially, adopted, by, the, international, clinical, phonetics, and, linguistics, association, in, 1994, the, general, principle, of, the, ipa, is, to, provide, one, letter, for, each, distinctive, sound, speech, segment, this, means, that, the, alphabet, is, designed, for, transcribing, sounds, phones, not, phonemes, though, it, is, used, for, phonemic, transcription, as, well, a, few, letters, that, did, not, indicate, specific, sounds, have, been, retired, once, used, for, the, compound, tone, of, swedish, and, norwegian, and, once, used, for, the, moraic, nasal, of, japanese, though, one, remains, used, for, the, sj, sound, of, swedish, when, the, ipa, is, used, for, broad, phonetic, or, for, phonemic, transcription, the, letter, sound, correspondence, can, be, rather, loose, the, ipa, has, recommended, that, more, familiar, letters, be, used, when, that, would, not, cause, ambiguity, for, example, e, and, o, for, and, t, for, or, f, for, etc, indeed, in, the, illustration, of, hindi, in, the, ipa, handbook, the, letters, c, and, are, used, for, t, and, d, among, the, symbols, of, the, ipa, 107, letters, represent, consonants, and, vowels, 31, diacritics, are, used, to, modify, these, and, 17, additional, signs, indicate, suprasegmental, qualities, such, as, length, tone, stress, and, intonation, these, are, organized, into, a, chart, the, chart, displayed, here, is, the, official, chart, as, posted, at, the, website, of, the, ipa, the, letters, chosen, for, the, ipa, are, meant, to, harmonize, with, the, latin, alphabet, for, this, reason, most, letters, are, either, latin, or, greek, or, modifications, thereof, some, letters, are, neither, for, example, the, letter, denoting, the, glottal, stop, originally, had, the, form, of, a, question, mark, with, the, dot, removed, a, few, letters, such, as, that, of, the, voiced, pharyngeal, fricative, were, inspired, by, other, writing, systems, in, this, case, the, arabic, letter, ayn, via, the, reversed, apostrophe, some, letter, forms, derive, from, existing, letters, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, is, based, on, the, latin, script, and, uses, as, few, non, latin, letters, as, possible, the, association, created, the, ipa, so, that, the, sound, values, of, most, letters, would, correspond, to, international, usage, approximately, classical, latin, hence, the, consonant, letters, b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, v, w, and, z, have, more, or, less, their, word, initial, values, in, english, g, as, in, gill, h, as, in, hill, though, p, t, k, are, unaspirated, as, in, spill, still, skill, and, the, vowel, letters, a, e, i, o, u, correspond, to, the, long, sound, values, of, latin, is, like, the, vowel, in, mach, i, ne, is, as, in, r, u, le, etc, other, latin, letters, particularly, j, r, and, y, differ, from, english, but, have, their, ipa, values, in, latin, or, other, european, languages, this, basic, latin, inventory, was, extended, by, adding, small, capital, and, cursive, forms, diacritics, and, rotation, the, sound, values, of, these, letters, are, related, to, those, of, the, original, letters, and, their, derivation, may, be, iconic, for, example, letters, with, a, rightward, facing, hook, at, the, bottom, represent, retroflex, equivalents, of, the, source, letters, and, small, capital, letters, usually, represent, uvular, equivalents, of, their, source, letters, there, are, also, several, letters, from, the, greek, alphabet, though, their, sound, values, may, differ, from, greek, for, most, greek, letters, subtly, different, glyph, shapes, have, been, devised, for, the, ipa, specifically, and, which, are, encoded, in, unicode, separately, from, their, parent, greek, letters, one, however, has, only, its, greek, form, while, for, and, both, greek, and, latin, forms, are, in, common, use, the, tone, letters, are, not, derived, from, an, alphabet, but, from, a, pitch, trace, on, a, musical, scale, beyond, the, letters, themselves, there, are, a, variety, of, secondary, symbols, which, aid, in, transcription, diacritic, marks, can, be, combined, with, ipa, letters, to, add, phonetic, detail, such, as, tone, and, secondary, articulations, there, are, also, special, symbols, for, prosodic, features, such, as, stress, and, intonation, there, are, two, principal, types, of, brackets, used, to, set, off, delimit, ipa, transcriptions, less, common, conventions, include, all, three, of, the, above, are, provided, by, the, ipa, handbook, the, following, are, not, but, may, be, seen, in, ipa, transcription, or, in, associated, material, especially, angle, brackets, other, symbols, sometimes, seen, are, pipes, and, double, pipes, from, americanist, phonetic, notation, and, braces, from, set, theory, especially, when, enclosing, the, set, of, phonemes, that, constitute, the, morphophoneme, e, g, t, d, or, t, d, or, t, d, only, double, slashes, are, unambiguous, both, pipes, and, braces, conflict, with, ipa, prosodic, transcription, for, example, cot, would, be, used, for, the, orthography, of, the, english, word, cot, as, opposed, to, its, pronunciation, k, t, italics, are, usual, when, words, are, written, as, themselves, as, with, cot, in, the, previous, sentence, rather, than, to, specifically, note, their, orthography, however, this, is, sometimes, ambiguous, and, italic, markup, is, not, always, accessible, to, sight, impaired, readers, who, rely, on, screen, reader, technology, vertical, lines, are, used, to, denote, glyphs, the, etic, units, which, represent, individual, concrete, realizations, of, graphemes, for, example, the, different, shapes, of, single, storey, and, double, storey, a, glyphs, both, represent, the, single, grapheme, a, in, ordinary, english, writing, but, represent, distinct, graphemes, in, the, ipa, some, examples, of, contrasting, brackets, in, the, literature, in, some, english, accents, the, phoneme, l, which, is, usually, spelled, as, l, or, ll, is, articulated, as, two, distinct, allophones, the, clear, occurs, before, vowels, and, the, consonant, j, whereas, the, dark, occurs, before, consonants, except, j, and, at, the, end, of, words, the, alternations, f, v, in, plural, formation, in, one, class, of, nouns, as, in, knife, na, f, knives, na, vz, which, can, be, represented, morphophonemically, as, na, v, na, v, z, the, morphophoneme, v, stands, for, the, phoneme, set, f, v, f, finals, held, in, barcelona, and, madrid, ipa, letters, have, cursive, forms, designed, for, use, in, manuscripts, and, when, taking, field, notes, but, the, handbook, recommended, against, their, use, as, cursive, ipa, is, harder, for, most, people, to, decipher, a, braille, representation, of, the, ipa, for, blind, or, visually, impaired, professionals, and, students, has, also, been, developed, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, is, occasionally, modified, by, the, association, after, each, modification, the, association, provides, an, updated, simplified, presentation, of, the, alphabet, in, the, form, of, a, chart, see, history, of, the, ipa, not, all, aspects, of, the, alphabet, can, be, accommodated, in, a, chart, of, the, size, published, by, the, ipa, the, alveolo, palatal, and, epiglottal, consonants, for, example, are, not, included, in, the, consonant, chart, for, reasons, of, space, rather, than, of, theory, two, additional, columns, would, be, required, one, between, the, retroflex, and, palatal, columns, and, the, other, between, the, pharyngeal, and, glottal, columns, and, the, lateral, flap, would, require, an, additional, row, for, that, single, consonant, so, they, are, listed, instead, under, the, catchall, block, of, other, symbols, the, indefinitely, large, number, of, tone, letters, would, make, a, full, accounting, impractical, even, on, a, larger, page, and, only, a, few, examples, are, shown, and, even, the, tone, diacritics, are, not, complete, the, reversed, tone, letters, are, not, illustrated, at, all, the, procedure, for, modifying, the, alphabet, or, the, chart, is, to, propose, the, change, in, the, journal, of, the, ipa, see, for, example, december, 2008, on, an, open, central, unrounded, vowel, and, august, 2011, on, central, approximants, reactions, to, the, proposal, may, be, published, in, the, same, or, subsequent, issues, of, the, journal, as, in, august, 2009, on, the, open, central, vowel, a, formal, proposal, is, then, put, to, the, council, of, the, ipa, which, is, elected, by, the, membership, for, further, discussion, and, a, formal, vote, many, users, of, the, alphabet, including, the, leadership, of, the, association, itself, deviate, from, its, standardized, usage, the, journal, of, the, ipa, finds, it, acceptable, to, mix, ipa, and, extipa, symbols, in, consonant, charts, in, their, articles, for, instance, including, the, extipa, letter, rather, than, in, an, illustration, of, the, ipa, of, more, than, 160, ipa, symbols, relatively, few, will, be, used, to, transcribe, speech, in, any, one, language, with, various, levels, of, precision, a, precise, phonetic, transcription, in, which, sounds, are, specified, in, detail, is, known, as, a, narrow, transcription, a, coarser, transcription, with, less, detail, is, called, a, broad, transcription, both, are, relative, terms, and, both, are, generally, enclosed, in, square, brackets, broad, phonetic, transcriptions, may, restrict, themselves, to, easily, heard, details, or, only, to, details, that, are, relevant, to, the, discussion, at, hand, and, may, differ, little, if, at, all, from, phonemic, transcriptions, but, they, make, no, theoretical, claim, that, all, the, distinctions, transcribed, are, necessarily, meaningful, in, the, language, for, example, the, english, word, little, may, be, transcribed, broadly, as, approximately, describing, many, pronunciations, a, narrower, transcription, may, focus, on, individual, or, dialectical, details, in, general, american, in, cockney, or, in, southern, us, english, phonemic, transcriptions, which, express, the, conceptual, counterparts, of, spoken, sounds, are, usually, enclosed, in, slashes, and, tend, to, use, simpler, letters, with, few, diacritics, the, choice, of, ipa, letters, may, reflect, theoretical, claims, of, how, speakers, conceptualize, sounds, as, phonemes, or, they, may, be, merely, a, convenience, for, typesetting, phonemic, approximations, between, slashes, do, not, have, absolute, sound, values, for, instance, in, english, either, the, vowel, of, pick, or, the, vowel, of, peak, may, be, transcribed, as, i, so, that, pick, peak, would, be, transcribed, as, pik, pi, k, or, as, p, k, pik, and, neither, is, identical, to, the, vowel, of, the, french, pique, which, would, also, be, transcribed, pik, by, contrast, a, narrow, phonetic, transcription, of, pick, peak, pique, could, be, ipa, is, popular, for, transcription, by, linguists, some, american, linguists, however, use, a, mix, of, ipa, with, americanist, phonetic, notation, or, sinological, phonetic, notation, or, otherwise, use, nonstandard, symbols, for, various, reasons, authors, who, employ, such, nonstandard, use, are, encouraged, to, include, a, chart, or, other, explanation, of, their, choices, which, is, good, practice, in, general, as, linguists, differ, in, their, understanding, of, the, exact, meaning, of, ipa, symbols, and, common, conventions, change, over, time, many, british, dictionaries, including, the, oxford, english, dictionary, and, some, learner, s, dictionaries, such, as, the, oxford, advanced, learner, s, dictionary, and, the, cambridge, advanced, learner, s, dictionary, now, use, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, to, represent, the, pronunciation, of, words, however, most, american, and, some, british, volumes, use, one, of, a, variety, of, pronunciation, respelling, systems, intended, to, be, more, comfortable, for, readers, of, english, and, to, be, more, acceptable, across, dialects, without, the, implication, of, a, preferred, pronunciation, that, the, ipa, might, convey, for, example, the, respelling, systems, in, many, american, dictionaries, such, as, merriam, webster, use, y, for, ipa, and, sh, for, ipa, reflecting, the, usual, spelling, of, those, sounds, in, english, in, ipa, represents, the, sound, of, the, french, u, as, in, tu, and, represents, the, sequence, of, consonants, in, gra, ssh, opper, the, ipa, is, also, not, universal, among, dictionaries, in, languages, other, than, english, monolingual, dictionaries, of, languages, with, phonemic, orthographies, generally, do, not, bother, with, indicating, the, pronunciation, of, most, words, and, tend, to, use, respelling, systems, for, words, with, unexpected, pronunciations, dictionaries, produced, in, israel, use, the, ipa, rarely, and, sometimes, use, the, hebrew, alphabet, for, transcription, of, foreign, words, bilingual, dictionaries, that, translate, from, foreign, languages, into, russian, usually, employ, the, ipa, but, monolingual, russian, dictionaries, occasionally, use, pronunciation, respelling, for, foreign, words, the, ipa, is, more, common, in, bilingual, dictionaries, but, there, are, exceptions, here, too, mass, market, bilingual, czech, dictionaries, for, instance, tend, to, use, the, ipa, only, for, sounds, not, found, in, czech, ipa, letters, have, been, incorporated, into, the, alphabets, of, various, languages, notably, via, the, africa, alphabet, in, many, sub, saharan, languages, such, as, hausa, fula, akan, gbe, languages, manding, languages, lingala, etc, capital, case, variants, have, been, created, for, use, in, these, languages, for, example, kabiy, of, northern, togo, has, these, and, others, are, supported, by, unicode, but, appear, in, latin, ranges, other, than, the, ipa, extensions, in, the, ipa, itself, however, only, lower, case, letters, are, used, the, 1949, edition, of, the, ipa, handbook, indicated, that, an, asterisk, might, be, prefixed, to, indicate, that, a, word, was, a, proper, name, but, this, convention, was, not, included, in, the, 1999, handbook, which, notes, the, contrary, use, of, the, asterisk, as, a, placeholder, for, a, sound, or, feature, that, does, not, have, a, symbol, the, ipa, has, widespread, use, among, classical, singers, during, preparation, as, they, are, frequently, required, to, sing, in, a, variety, of, foreign, languages, they, are, also, taught, by, vocal, coaches, to, perfect, diction, and, improve, tone, quality, and, tuning, opera, librettos, are, authoritatively, transcribed, in, ipa, such, as, nico, castel, s, volumes, and, timothy, cheek, s, book, singing, in, czech, opera, singers, ability, to, read, ipa, was, used, by, the, site, visual, thesaurus, which, employed, several, opera, singers, to, make, recordings, for, the, 150, 000, words, and, phrases, in, vt, s, lexical, database, for, their, vocal, stamina, attention, to, the, details, of, enunciation, and, most, of, all, knowledge, of, ipa, the, international, phonetic, association, organizes, the, letters, of, the, ipa, into, three, categories, pulmonic, consonants, non, pulmonic, consonants, and, vowels, pulmonic, consonant, letters, are, arranged, singly, or, in, pairs, of, voiceless, tenuis, and, voiced, sounds, with, these, then, grouped, in, columns, from, front, labial, sounds, on, the, left, to, back, glottal, sounds, on, the, right, in, official, publications, by, the, ipa, two, columns, are, omitted, to, save, space, with, the, letters, listed, among, other, symbols, even, though, theoretically, they, belong, in, the, main, chart, they, are, arranged, in, rows, from, full, closure, occlusives, stops, and, nasals, at, top, to, brief, closure, vibrants, trills, and, taps, to, partial, closure, fricatives, and, finally, minimal, closure, approximants, at, bottom, again, with, a, row, left, out, to, save, space, in, the, table, below, a, slightly, different, arrangement, is, made, all, pulmonic, consonants, are, included, in, the, pulmonic, consonant, table, and, the, vibrants, and, laterals, are, separated, out, so, that, the, rows, reflect, the, common, lenition, pathway, of, stop, fricative, approximant, as, well, as, the, fact, that, several, letters, pull, double, duty, as, both, fricative, and, approximant, affricates, may, then, be, created, by, joining, stops, and, fricatives, from, adjacent, cells, shaded, cells, represent, articulations, that, are, judged, to, be, impossible, or, not, distinctive, vowel, letters, are, also, grouped, in, pairs, of, unrounded, and, rounded, vowel, sounds, with, these, pairs, also, arranged, from, front, on, the, left, to, back, on, the, right, and, from, maximal, closure, at, top, to, minimal, closure, at, bottom, no, vowel, letters, are, omitted, from, the, chart, though, in, the, past, some, of, the, mid, central, vowels, were, listed, among, the, other, symbols, a, pulmonic, consonant, is, a, consonant, made, by, obstructing, the, glottis, the, space, between, the, vocal, folds, or, oral, cavity, the, mouth, and, either, simultaneously, or, subsequently, letting, out, air, from, the, lungs, pulmonic, consonants, make, up, the, majority, of, consonants, in, the, ipa, as, well, as, in, human, language, all, consonants, in, english, fall, into, this, category, the, pulmonic, consonant, table, which, includes, most, consonants, is, arranged, in, rows, that, designate, manner, of, articulation, meaning, how, the, consonant, is, produced, and, columns, that, designate, place, of, articulation, meaning, where, in, the, vocal, tract, the, consonant, is, produced, the, main, chart, includes, only, consonants, with, a, single, place, of, articulation, notes, non, pulmonic, consonants, are, sounds, whose, airflow, is, not, dependent, on, the, lungs, these, include, clicks, found, in, the, khoisan, languages, and, some, neighboring, bantu, languages, of, africa, implosives, found, in, languages, such, as, sindhi, hausa, swahili, and, vietnamese, and, ejectives, found, in, many, amerindian, and, caucasian, languages, notes, affricates, and, co, articulated, stops, are, represented, by, two, letters, joined, by, a, tie, bar, either, above, or, below, the, letters, with, no, difference, in, meaning, affricates, are, optionally, represented, by, ligatures, e, g, though, this, is, no, longer, official, ipa, usage, because, a, great, number, of, ligatures, would, be, required, to, represent, all, affricates, this, way, alternatively, a, superscript, notation, for, a, consonant, release, is, sometimes, used, to, transcribe, affricates, for, example, t, for, paralleling, the, letters, for, the, palatal, plosives, c, and, are, often, used, as, a, convenience, for, and, or, similar, affricates, even, in, official, ipa, publications, so, they, must, be, interpreted, with, care, co, articulated, consonants, are, sounds, that, involve, two, simultaneous, places, of, articulation, are, pronounced, using, two, parts, of, the, vocal, tract, in, english, the, in, went, is, a, coarticulated, consonant, being, pronounced, by, rounding, the, lips, and, raising, the, back, of, the, tongue, similar, sounds, are, and, in, some, languages, plosives, can, be, double, articulated, for, example, in, the, name, of, laurent, gbagbo, notes, the, ipa, defines, a, vowel, as, a, sound, which, occurs, at, a, syllable, center, below, is, a, chart, depicting, the, vowels, of, the, ipa, the, ipa, maps, the, vowels, according, to, the, position, of, the, tongue, the, vertical, axis, of, the, chart, is, mapped, by, vowel, height, vowels, pronounced, with, the, tongue, lowered, are, at, the, bottom, and, vowels, pronounced, with, the, tongue, raised, are, at, the, top, for, example, the, first, vowel, in, father, is, at, the, bottom, because, the, tongue, is, lowered, in, this, position, the, vowel, in, meet, is, at, the, top, because, the, sound, is, said, with, the, tongue, raised, to, the, roof, of, the, mouth, in, a, similar, fashion, the, horizontal, axis, of, the, chart, is, determined, by, vowel, backness, vowels, with, the, tongue, moved, towards, the, front, of, the, mouth, such, as, the, vowel, in, met, are, to, the, left, in, the, chart, while, those, in, which, it, is, moved, to, the, back, such, as, the, vowel, in, but, are, placed, to, the, right, in, the, chart, in, places, where, vowels, are, paired, the, right, represents, a, rounded, vowel, in, which, the, lips, are, rounded, while, the, left, is, its, unrounded, counterpart, diphthongs, are, typically, specified, with, a, non, syllabic, diacritic, as, in, ui, or, u, i, or, with, a, superscript, for, the, on, or, off, glide, as, in, u, or, i, sometimes, a, tie, bar, is, used, u, i, especially, when, it, is, difficult, to, tell, if, the, diphthong, is, characterized, by, an, on, glide, or, an, off, glide, or, when, it, is, variable, notes, diacritics, are, used, for, phonetic, detail, they, are, added, to, ipa, letters, to, indicate, a, modification, or, specification, of, that, letter, s, normal, pronunciation, by, being, made, superscript, any, ipa, letter, may, function, as, a, diacritic, conferring, elements, of, its, articulation, to, the, base, letter, those, superscript, letters, listed, below, are, specifically, provided, for, by, the, ipa, handbook, other, uses, can, be, illustrated, with, t, with, fricative, release, s, with, affricate, onset, d, prenasalized, b, with, breathy, voice, m, glottalized, s, with, a, flavor, of, i, e, a, voiceless, alveolar, retracted, sibilant, o, with, diphthongization, compressed, superscript, diacritics, placed, after, a, letter, are, ambiguous, between, simultaneous, modification, of, the, sound, and, phonetic, detail, at, the, end, of, the, sound, for, example, labialized, k, may, mean, either, simultaneous, and, or, else, with, a, labialized, release, superscript, diacritics, placed, before, a, letter, on, the, other, hand, normally, indicate, a,

above, a, letter, to, avoid, conflict, with, a, descender, as, in, voiceless, the, raising, and, lowering, diacritics, have, optional, spacing, forms, that, avoid, descenders, the, state, of, the,

the, extensions, to, the, ipa, for, speech, pathology, these, symbols, describe, the, features, of, a, language, above, the, level, of, individual, consonants, and, vowels, that, is, at, the, level, of, syllable, word, or, phrase, these, include, prosody, pitch, length, stress, intensity, tone, and, gemination, of, the, sounds, of, a, language, as, well, as, the, rhythm, and, intonation, of, speech, various, ligatures, of, pitch, tone, letters, and, diacritics, are, provided, for, by, the, kiel, convention, and, used, in, the, ipa, handbook, despite, not, being, found, in, the, summary, of, the, ipa, alphabet, found, on, the, one, page, chart, under, capital, letters, below, we, will, see, how, a, carrier, letter, may, be, used, to, indicate, suprasegmental, features, such, as, labialization, or, nasalization, some, authors, omit, the, carrier, letter, for, e, g, suffixed, or, prefixed, or, place, a, spacing, variant, of, a, diacritic, such, as, or, at, the, beginning, or, end, of, a, word, to, indicate, that, it, applies, to, the, entire, word, notes, the, old, staveless, tone, letters, which, are, effectively, obsolete, include, high, e, mid, e, low, e, rising, e, falling, e, low, rising, e, and, low, falling, e, officially, the, stress, marks, appear, before, the, stressed, syllable, and, thus, mark, the, syllable, boundary, as, well, as, stress, though, the, syllable, boundary, may, still, be, explicitly, marked, with, a, period, occasionally, the, stress, mark, is, placed, immediately, before, the, nucleus, of, the, syllable, after, any, consonantal, onset, in, such, transcriptions, the, stress, mark, does, not, mark, a, syllable, boundary, the, primary, stress, mark, may, be, doubled, for, extra, stress, such, as, prosodic, stress, the, secondary, stress, mark, is, sometimes, seen, doubled, for, extra, weak, stress, but, this, convention, has, not, been, adopted, by, the, ipa, some, dictionaries, place, both, stress, marks, before, a, syllable, to, indicate, that, pronunciations, with, either, primary, or, secondary, stress, are, heard, though, this, is, not, ipa, usage, there, are, three, boundary, markers, for, a, syllable, break, for, a, minor, prosodic, break, and, for, a, major, prosodic, break, the, tags, minor, and, major, are, intentionally, ambiguous, depending, on, need, minor, may, vary, from, a, foot, break, to, a, break, in, list, intonation, to, a, continuing, prosodic, unit, boundary, equivalent, to, a, comma, and, while, major, is, often, any, intonation, break, it, may, be, restricted, to, a, final, prosodic, unit, boundary, equivalent, to, a, period, the, major, symbol, may, also, be, doubled, for, a, stronger, break, although, not, part, of, the, ipa, the, following, additional, boundary, markers, are, often, used, in, conjunction, with, the, ipa, for, a, mora, or, mora, boundary, for, a, syllable, or, syllable, boundary, for, a, morpheme, boundary, for, a, word, boundary, may, be, doubled, for, e, g, a, breath, group, boundary, for, a, phrase, or, intermediate, boundary, and, for, a, prosodic, boundary, for, example, c, is, a, word, final, consonant, v, a, post, pausa, vowel, and, c, a, syllable, initial, consonant, are, defined, in, the, handbook, as, upstep, and, downstep, concepts, from, tonal, languages, however, the, upstep, symbol, can, also, be, used, for, pitch, reset, and, the, ipa, handbook, uses, it, for, prosody, in, the, illustration, for, portuguese, a, non, tonal, language, phonetic, pitch, and, phonemic, tone, may, be, indicated, by, either, diacritics, placed, over, the, nucleus, of, the, syllable, e, g, high, pitch, or, by, chao, tone, letters, placed, either, before, or, after, the, word, or, syllable, there, are, three, graphic, variants, of, the, tone, letters, with, or, without, a, stave, and, facing, left, or, facing, right, from, the, stave, the, stave, was, introduced, with, the, 1989, kiel, convention, as, was, the, option, of, placing, a, staved, letter, after, the, word, or, syllable, while, retaining, the, older, conventions, there, are, therefore, six, ways, to, transcribe, pitch, tone, in, the, ipa, i, e, e, e, e, e, and, e, for, a, high, pitch, tone, of, the, tone, letters, only, left, facing, staved, letters, and, a, few, representative, combinations, are, shown, in, the, summary, on, the, chart, and, in, practice, it, is, currently, more, common, for, tone, letters, to, occur, after, the, syllable, word, than, before, as, in, the, chao, tradition, placement, before, the, word, is, a, carry, over, from, the, pre, kiel, ipa, convention, as, is, still, the, case, for, the, stress, and, upstep, downstep, marks, the, ipa, endorses, the, chao, tradition, of, using, the, left, facing, tone, letters, for, underlying, tone, and, the, right, facing, letters, for, surface, tone, as, occurs, in, tone, sandhi, and, for, the, intonation, of, non, tonal, languages, in, the, portuguese, illustration, in, the, 1999, handbook, tone, letters, are, placed, before, a, word, or, syllable, to, indicate, prosodic, pitch, equivalent, to, global, rise, and, global, fall, but, allowing, more, precision, and, in, the, cantonese, illustration, they, are, placed, after, a, word, syllable, to, indicate, lexical, tone, theoretically, therefore, prosodic, pitch, and, lexical, tone, could, be, simultaneously, transcribed, in, a, single, text, though, this, is, not, a, formalized, distinction, rising, and, falling, pitch, as, in, contour, tones, are, indicated, by, combining, the, pitch, diacritics, and, letters, in, the, table, such, as, grave, plus, acute, for, rising, and, acute, plus, grave, for, falling, only, six, combinations, of, two, diacritics, are, supported, and, only, across, three, levels, high, mid, low, despite, the, diacritics, supporting, five, levels, of, pitch, in, isolation, the, four, other, explicitly, approved, rising, and, falling, diacritic, combinations, are, high, mid, rising, low, rising, high, falling, and, low, mid, falling, the, chao, tone, letters, on, the, other, hand, may, be, combined, in, any, pattern, and, are, therefore, used, for, more, complex, contours, and, finer, distinctions, than, the, diacritics, allow, such, as, mid, rising, extra, high, falling, etc, there, are, 20, such, possibilities, however, in, chao, s, original, proposal, which, was, adopted, by, the, ipa, in, 1989, he, stipulated, that, the, half, high, and, half, low, letters, may, be, combined, with, each, other, but, not, with, the, other, three, tone, letters, so, as, not, to, create, spuriously, precise, distinctions, with, this, restriction, there, are, 8, possibilities, the, old, staveless, tone, letters, tend, to, be, more, restricted, than, the, staved, letters, though, not, as, restricted, as, the, diacritics, officially, they, support, as, many, distinctions, as, the, staved, letters, but, typically, only, three, pitch, levels, are, distinguished, unicode, supports, default, or, high, pitch, and, low, pitch, only, a, few, mid, pitch, tones, are, supported, such, as, and, then, only, accidentally, although, tone, diacritics, and, tone, letters, are, presented, as, equivalent, on, the, chart, this, was, done, only, to, simplify, the, layout, of, the, chart, the, two, sets, of, symbols, are, not, comparable, in, this, way, using, diacritics, a, high, tone, is, and, a, low, tone, is, in, tone, letters, these, are, e, and, e, one, can, double, the, diacritics, for, extra, high, e, and, extra, low, there, is, no, parallel, to, this, using, tone, letters, instead, tone, letters, have, mid, high, e, and, mid, low, e, again, there, is, no, equivalent, among, the, diacritics, thus, in, a, three, register, tone, system, are, equivalent, to, e, e, e, while, in, a, four, register, system, e, may, be, equivalent, to, e, e, e, e, the, correspondence, breaks, down, even, further, once, they, start, combining, for, more, complex, tones, one, may, combine, three, or, four, tone, diacritics, in, any, permutation, though, in, practice, only, generic, peaking, rising, falling, e, and, dipping, falling, rising, e, combinations, are, used, chao, tone, letters, are, required, for, finer, detail, e, e, e, e, etc, although, only, 10, peaking, and, dipping, tones, were, proposed, in, chao, s, original, limited, set, of, tone, letters, phoneticians, often, make, finer, distinctions, and, indeed, an, example, is, found, on, the, ipa, chart, the, system, allows, the, transcription, of, 112, peaking, and, dipping, pitch, contours, including, tones, that, are, level, for, part, of, their, length, more, complex, contours, are, possible, chao, gave, an, example, of, mid, high, low, mid, from, english, prosody, chao, tone, letters, generally, appear, after, each, syllable, for, a, language, with, syllable, tone, a, v, or, after, the, phonological, word, for, a, language, with, word, tone, av, the, ipa, gives, the, option, of, placing, the, tone, letters, before, the, word, or, syllable, a, v, av, but, this, is, rare, for, lexical, tone, and, indeed, reversed, tone, letters, may, be, used, to, clarify, that, they, apply, to, the, following, rather, than, to, the, preceding, syllable, a, v, av, the, staveless, letters, are, not, directly, supported, by, unicode, but, some, fonts, allow, the, stave, in, chao, tone, letters, to, be, suppressed, ipa, diacritics, may, be, doubled, to, indicate, an, extra, degree, greater, intensity, of, the, feature, indicated, this, is, a, productive, process, but, apart, from, extra, high, and, extra, low, tones, being, marked, by, doubled, high, and, low, tone, diacritics, the, major, prosodic, break, being, marked, as, a, doubled, minor, break, and, a, couple, other, instances, such, usage, is, not, enumerated, by, the, ipa, for, example, the, stress, mark, may, be, doubled, or, even, tripled, etc, to, indicate, an, extra, degree, of, stress, such, as, prosodic, stress, in, english, an, example, in, french, with, a, single, stress, mark, for, normal, prosodic, stress, at, the, end, of, each, prosodic, unit, marked, as, a, minor, prosodic, break, and, a, double, or, even, triple, stress, mark, for, contrastive, emphatic, stress, entrez, monsieur, voil, madame, similarly, a, doubled, secondary, stress, mark, is, commonly, used, for, tertiary, extra, light, stress, though, a, proposal, to, officially, adopt, this, was, rejected, in, a, similar, vein, the, effectively, obsolete, staveless, tone, letters, were, once, doubled, for, an, emphatic, rising, intonation, and, an, emphatic, falling, intonation, length, is, commonly, extended, by, repeating, the, length, mark, which, may, be, phonetic, as, in, etc, as, in, english, shhh, or, phonemic, as, in, the, overlong, segments, of, estonian, normally, additional, phonemic, degrees, of, length, are, handled, by, the, extra, short, or, half, long, diacritic, i, e, e, e, e, or, e, e, but, the, first, two, words, in, each, of, the, estonian, examples, are, analyzed, as, typically, short, and, long, e, e, and, n, n, requiring, a, different, remedy, for, the, additional, words, delimiters, are, similar, double, slashes, indicate, extra, phonemic, morpho, phonemic, double, square, brackets, especially, precise, transcription, and, double, parentheses, especially, unintelligible, occasionally, other, diacritics, are, doubled, the, extipa, provides, combining, parentheses, for, weak, intensity, which, when, combined, with, a, doubled, diacritic, indicate, an, intermediate, degree, for, instance, increasing, degrees, of, nasalization, of, the, vowel, might, be, written, e, as, noted, above, ipa, letters, are, often, used, quite, loosely, in, broad, transcription, if, no, ambiguity, would, arise, in, a, particular, language, because, of, that, ipa, letters, have, not, generally, been, created, for, sounds, that, are, not, distinguished, in, individual, languages, a, distinction, between, voiced, fricatives, and, approximants, is, only, partially, implemented, by, the, ipa, for, example, even, with, the, relatively, recent, addition, of, the, palatal, fricative, and, the, velar, approximant, to, the, alphabet, other, letters, though, defined, as, fricatives, are, often, ambiguous, between, fricative, and, approximant, for, forward, places, and, can, generally, be, assumed, to, be, fricatives, unless, they, carry, a, lowering, diacritic, rearward, however, and, are, perhaps, more, commonly, intended, to, be, approximants, even, without, a, lowering, diacritic, h, and, are, similarly, either, fricatives, or, approximants, depending, on, the, language, or, even, glottal, transitions, without, that, often, being, specified, in, the, transcription, another, common, ambiguity, is, among, the, letters, for, palatal, consonants, c, and, are, not, uncommonly, used, as, a, typographic, convenience, for, affricates, typically, and, while, and, are, commonly, used, for, palatalized, alveolar, and, to, some, extent, this, may, be, an, effect, of, analysis, but, it, is, common, to, match, up, single, ipa, letters, to, the, phonemes, of, a, language, without, overly, worrying, about, phonetic, precision, it, has, been, argued, that, the, lower, pharyngeal, epiglottal, fricatives, and, are, better, characterized, as, trills, rather, than, as, fricatives, that, have, incidental, trilling, this, has, the, advantage, of, merging, the, upper, pharyngeal, fricatives, together, with, the, epiglottal, plosive, and, trills, into, a, single, pharyngeal, column, in, the, consonant, chart, however, in, shilha, berber, the, epiglottal, fricatives, are, not, trilled, although, they, might, be, transcribed, to, indicate, this, the, far, more, common, transcription, is, which, is, therefore, ambiguous, between, languages, among, vowels, a, is, officially, a, front, vowel, but, is, more, commonly, treated, as, a, central, vowel, the, difference, to, the, extent, it, is, even, possible, is, not, phonemic, in, any, language, for, all, phonetic, notation, it, is, good, practice, for, an, author, to, specify, exactly, what, they, mean, by, the, symbols, that, they, use, superscript, ipa, letters, are, used, to, indicate, secondary, aspects, of, articulation, these, may, be, aspects, of, simultaneous, articulation, that, are, considered, to, be, in, some, sense, less, dominant, than, the, basic, sound, or, may, be, transitional, articulations, that, are, interpreted, as, secondary, elements, examples, include, secondary, articulation, onsets, releases, and, other, transitions, shades, of, sound, light, epenthetic, sounds, and, incompletely, articulated, sounds, morphophonemically, superscripts, may, be, used, for, assimilation, e, g, a, for, the, effect, of, labialization, on, a, vowel, a, which, may, be, realized, as, phonemic, o, the, ipa, and, icpla, endorse, unicode, encoding, of, superscript, variants, of, all, contemporary, segmental, letters, including, the, implicit, ipa, retroflex, letters, superscripts, are, often, used, as, a, substitute, for, the, tie, bar, for, example, t, for, and, k, or, p, for, however, in, precise, notation, there, is, a, difference, between, a, fricative, release, in, and, the, affricate, between, a, velar, onset, in, and, doubly, articulated, superscript, letters, can, be, meaningfully, modified, by, combining, diacritics, just, as, baseline, letters, can, for, example, a, superscript, dental, nasal, in, d, a, superscript, voiceless, velar, nasal, in, and, labial, velar, prenasalization, in, b, although, the, diacritic, may, seem, a, bit, oversized, compared, to, the, superscript, letter, it, modifies, e, g, this, can, be, an, aid, to, legibility, just, as, it, is, with, the, composite, superscript, c, cedilla, and, rhotic, vowels, superscript, length, marks, can, be, used, to, indicate, the, length, of, aspiration, of, a, consonant, e, g, another, option, is, to, use, extipa, parentheses, and, a, doubled, diacritic, p, t, k, a, number, of, ipa, letters, and, diacritics, have, been, retired, or, replaced, over, the, years, this, number, includes, duplicate, symbols, symbols, that, were, replaced, due, to, user, preference, and, unitary, symbols, that, were, rendered, with, diacritics, or, digraphs, to, reduce, the, inventory, of, the, ipa, the, rejected, symbols, are, now, considered, obsolete, though, some, are, still, seen, in, the, literature, the, ipa, once, had, several, pairs, of, duplicate, symbols, from, alternative, proposals, but, eventually, settled, on, one, or, the, other, an, example, is, the, vowel, letter, rejected, in, favor, of, affricates, were, once, transcribed, with, ligatures, such, as, and, others, some, of, which, not, found, in, unicode, these, have, been, officially, retired, but, are, still, used, letters, for, specific, combinations, of, primary, and, secondary, articulation, have, also, been, mostly, retired, with, the, idea, that, such, features, should, be, indicated, with, tie, bars, or, diacritics, for, is, one, in, addition, the, rare, voiceless, implosives, were, dropped, soon, after, their, introduction, and, are, now, usually, written, the, original, set, of, click, letters, was, retired, but, is, still, sometimes, seen, as, the, current, pipe, letters, can, cause, problems, with, legibility, especially, when, used, with, brackets, or, the, letter, l, small, l, or, the, prosodic, marks, for, this, reason, some, publications, which, use, the, current, ipa, pipe, letters, disallow, ipa, brackets, individual, non, ipa, letters, may, find, their, way, into, publications, that, otherwise, use, the, standard, ipa, this, is, especially, common, with, in, addition, it, is, common, to, see, ad, hoc, typewriter, substitutions, generally, capital, letters, for, when, ipa, support, is, not, available, e, g, s, for, see, also, sampa, and, x, sampa, substitute, notation, the, extensions, to, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, for, disordered, speech, commonly, abbreviated, extipa, and, sometimes, called, extended, ipa, are, symbols, whose, original, purpose, was, to, accurately, transcribe, disordered, speech, at, the, kiel, convention, in, 1989, a, group, of, linguists, drew, up, the, initial, extensions, which, were, based, on, the, previous, work, of, the, prds, phonetic, representation, of, disordered, speech, group, in, the, early, 1980s, the, extensions, were, first, published, in, 1990, then, modified, and, published, again, in, 1994, in, the, journal, of, the, international, phonetic, association, when, they, were, officially, adopted, by, the, icpla, while, the, original, purpose, was, to, transcribe, disordered, speech, linguists, have, used, the, extensions, to, designate, a, number, of, sounds, within, standard, communication, such, as, hushing, gnashing, teeth, and, smacking, lips, as, well, as, regular, lexical, sounds, such, as, lateral, fricatives, that, do, not, have, standard, ipa, symbols, in, addition, to, the, extensions, to, the, ipa, for, disordered, speech, there, are, the, conventions, of, the, voice, quality, symbols, which, include, a, number, of, symbols, for, additional, airstream, mechanisms, and, secondary, articulations, in, what, they, call, voice, quality, capital, letters, and, various, characters, on, the, number, row, of, the, keyboard, are, commonly, used, to, extend, the, alphabet, in, various, ways, there, are, various, punctuation, like, conventions, for, linguistic, transcription, that, are, commonly, used, together, with, ipa, some, of, the, more, common, are, full, capital, letters, are, not, used, as, ipa, symbols, except, as, typewriter, substitutes, e, g, n, for, s, for, o, for, see, sampa, they, are, however, often, used, in, conjunction, with, the, ipa, in, two, cases, wildcards, are, commonly, used, in, phonology, to, summarize, syllable, or, word, shapes, or, to, show, the, evolution, of, classes, of, sounds, for, example, the, possible, syllable, shapes, of, mandarin, can, be, abstracted, as, ranging, from, v, an, atonic, vowel, to, cgvn, a, consonant, glide, vowel, nasal, syllable, with, tone, and, word, final, devoicing, may, be, schematized, as, c, c, in, speech, pathology, capital, letters, represent, indeterminate, sounds, and, may, be, superscripted, to, indicate, they, are, weakly, articulated, e, g, is, a, weak, indeterminate, alveolar, a, weak, indeterminate, velar, there, is, a, degree, of, variation, between, authors, as, to, the, capital, letters, used, but, c, for, consonant, v, for, vowel, and, n, for, nasal, are, ubiquitous, in, english, language, material, other, common, conventions, are, t, for, tone, accent, tonicity, p, for, plosive, f, for, fricative, s, for, sibilant, g, for, glide, semivowel, l, for, lateral, or, liquid, r, for, rhotic, or, resonant, sonorant, for, obstruent, for, click, a, e, o, u, for, open, front, back, close, rounded, vowel, and, b, d, k, q, h, for, labial, alveolar, post, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, glottal, consonant, respectively, and, x, for, any, sound, as, in, cvx, for, a, heavy, syllable, cvc, cvv, cv, the, letters, can, be, modified, with, ipa, diacritics, for, example, c, for, ejective, for, implosive, n, c, or, c, for, prenasalized, consonant, for, nasal, vowel, c, v, for, aspirated, cv, syllable, with, high, tone, s, for, voiced, sibilant, n, for, voiceless, nasal, p, f, or, p, for, affricate, c, for, a, consonant, with, a, glide, as, secondary, articulation, e, g, c, for, palatalized, consonant, and, c, for, labialized, consonant, and, d, for, dental, consonant, h, m, l, are, also, commonly, used, for, high, mid, and, low, tone, with, lh, for, rising, tone, and, hl, for, falling, tone, rather, than, transcribing, them, overly, precisely, with, ipa, tone, letters, or, with, ambiguous, digits, typical, examples, of, archiphonemic, use, of, capital, letters, are, i, for, the, turkish, harmonic, vowel, set, i, y, u, d, for, the, conflated, flapped, middle, consonant, of, american, english, writer, and, rider, n, for, the, homorganic, syllable, coda, nasal, of, languages, such, as, spanish, and, japanese, essentially, equivalent, to, the, wild, card, usage, of, the, letter, and, r, in, cases, where, a, phonemic, distinction, between, trill, r, and, flap, is, conflated, as, in, spanish, enrejar, enre, xar, the, n, is, homorganic, and, the, first, r, is, a, trill, but, the, second, r, is, variable, similar, usage, is, found, for, phonemic, analysis, where, a, language, does, not, distinguish, sounds, that, have, separate, letters, in, the, ipa, for, instance, castillian, spanish, has, been, analyzed, as, having, phonemes, and, s, which, surface, as, and, in, voiceless, environments, and, as, and, in, voiced, environments, e, g, hazte, a, te, vs, hazme, a, me, or, las, manos, las, manos, v, f, and, c, have, completely, different, meanings, as, voice, quality, symbols, where, they, stand, for, voice, voqs, jargon, for, secondary, articulation, falsetto, and, creak, these, three, letters, may, take, diacritics, to, indicate, what, kind, of, voice, quality, an, utterance, has, and, may, be, used, as, carrier, letters, to, extract, a, suprasegmental, feature, that, occurs, on, all, susceptible, segments, in, a, stretch, of, ipa, for, instance, the, transcription, of, scottish, gaelic, cat, and, cats, islay, dialect, can, be, made, more, economical, by, extracting, the, suprasegmental, labialization, of, the, words, v, and, v, the, conventional, wildcards, x, or, c, might, be, used, instead, of, voqs, v, so, that, the, reader, does, not, misinterpret, v, as, meaning, that, only, vowels, are, labialized, i, e, x, for, all, segments, labialized, c, for, all, consonants, labialized, or, the, carrier, letter, may, be, omitted, altogether, e, g, or, see, suprasegmentals, for, other, transcription, conventions, this, summary, is, to, some, extent, valid, internationally, but, linguistic, material, written, in, other, languages, may, have, different, associations, with, capital, letters, used, as, wildcards, for, example, in, german, k, and, v, are, used, for, konsonant, consonant, and, vokal, vowel, in, french, tone, may, be, transcribed, with, h, and, b, for, haut, high, and, bas, low, the, blank, cells, on, the, summary, ipa, chart, can, be, filled, without, much, difficulty, if, the, need, arises, the, missing, retroflex, letters, namely, are, implicit, in, the, alphabet, and, the, ipa, supported, their, adoption, into, unicode, attested, in, the, literature, are, the, retroflex, implosive, the, voiceless, retroflex, lateral, fricative, the, retroflex, lateral, flap, and, the, retroflex, click, the, first, is, also, mentioned, in, the, ipa, handbook, and, the, lateral, fricatives, are, provided, for, by, the, extipa, the, epiglottal, trill, is, arguably, covered, by, the, generally, trilled, epiglottal, fricatives, ad, hoc, letters, for, near, close, central, vowels, are, used, in, some, descriptions, of, english, though, those, are, specifically, reduced, vowels, forming, a, set, with, the, ipa, reduced, vowels, and, the, simple, points, in, vowel, space, are, easily, transcribed, with, diacritics, or, diacritics, are, able, to, fill, in, most, of, the, remainder, of, the, charts, if, a, sound, cannot, be, transcribed, an, asterisk, may, be, used, either, as, a, letter, or, as, a, diacritic, as, in, k, sometimes, seen, for, the, korean, fortis, velar, representations, of, consonant, sounds, outside, of, the, core, set, are, created, by, adding, diacritics, to, letters, with, similar, sound, values, the, spanish, bilabial, and, dental, approximants, are, commonly, written, as, lowered, fricatives, and, respectively, similarly, voiced, lateral, fricatives, can, be, written, as, raised, lateral, approximants, though, the, extipa, also, provides, for, the, first, of, these, a, few, languages, such, as, banda, have, a, bilabial, flap, as, the, preferred, allophone, of, what, is, elsewhere, a, labiodental, flap, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, be, written, with, the, labiodental, flap, letter, and, the, advanced, diacritic, similarly, a, labiodental, trill, would, be, written, bilabial, trill, and, the, dental, sign, and, the, labiodental, plosives, are, now, universally, p, b, rather, than, the, ad, hoc, letters, once, found, in, bantuist, literature, other, taps, can, be, written, as, extra, short, plosives, or, laterals, e, g, though, in, some, cases, the, diacritic, would, need, to, be, written, below, the, letter, a, retroflex, trill, can, be, written, as, a, retracted, just, as, non, subapical, retroflex, fricatives, sometimes, are, the, remaining, pulmonic, consonants, the, uvular, laterals, and, the, palatal, trill, while, not, strictly, impossible, are, very, difficult, to, pronounce, and, are, unlikely, to, occur, even, as, allophones, in, the, world, s, languages, the, vowels, are, similarly, manageable, by, using, diacritics, for, raising, lowering, fronting, backing, centering, and, mid, centering, for, example, the, unrounded, equivalent, of, can, be, transcribed, as, mid, centered, and, the, rounded, equivalent, of, as, raised, or, lowered, though, for, those, who, conceive, of, vowel, space, as, a, triangle, simple, already, is, the, rounded, equivalent, of, true, mid, vowels, are, lowered, or, raised, while, centered, and, or, less, commonly, are, near, close, and, open, central, vowels, respectively, the, only, known, vowels, that, cannot, be, represented, in, this, scheme, are, vowels, with, unexpected, roundedness, which, would, require, a, dedicated, diacritic, such, as, protruded, and, compressed, u, or, protruded, and, compressed, though, this, transcription, suggests, that, they, are, diphthongs, as, indeed, they, are, in, swedish, the, extipa, spread, diacritic, is, sometimes, seen, for, compressed, u, o, though, the, intended, meaning, needs, to, be, explained, or, they, will, be, interpreted, as, being, spread, the, way, is, ladefoged, maddieson, used, the, old, ipa, omega, diacritic, for, labialization, for, protrusion, w, like, labialization, without, velarization, e, g, protruded, y, while, kelly, local, use, a, combining, w, diacritic, for, protrusion, e, g, y, and, a, combining, turned, w, diacritic, for, compression, e, g, u, o, is, the, cursive, form, of, and, these, solutions, recall, an, old, ipa, convention, of, rounding, an, unrounded, vowel, letter, like, i, with, a, subscript, omega, and, unrounding, a, rounded, letter, like, u, with, a, turned, omega, as, of, 2024, the, turned, omega, diacritic, is, in, the, pipeline, for, unicode, an, ipa, symbol, is, often, distinguished, from, the, sound, it, is, intended, to, represent, since, there, is, not, necessarily, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, letter, and, sound, in, broad, transcription, making, articulatory, descriptions, such, as, mid, front, rounded, vowel, or, voiced, velar, stop, unreliable, while, the, handbook, of, the, international, phonetic, association, states, that, no, official, names, exist, for, its, symbols, it, admits, the, presence, of, one, or, two, common, names, for, each, the, symbols, also, have, nonce, names, in, the, unicode, standard, in, many, cases, the, names, in, unicode, and, the, ipa, handbook, differ, for, example, the, handbook, calls, epsilon, while, unicode, calls, it, small, letter, open, e, the, traditional, names, of, the, latin, and, greek, letters, are, usually, used, for, unmodified, letters, letters, which, are, not, directly, derived, from, these, alphabets, such, as, may, have, a, variety, of, names, sometimes, based, on, the, appearance, of, the, symbol, or, on, the, sound, that, it, represents, in, unicode, some, of, the, letters, of, greek, origin, have, latin, forms, for, use, in, ipa, the, others, use, the, characters, from, the, greek, block, for, diacritics, there, are, two, methods, of, naming, for, traditional, diacritics, the, ipa, notes, the, name, in, a, well, known, language, for, example, is, e, acute, based, on, the, name, of, the, diacritic, in, english, and, french, non, traditional, diacritics, are, often, named, after, objects, they, resemble, so, d, is, called, d, bridge, geoffrey, pullum, and, william, ladusaw, list, a, variety, of, names, in, use, for, both, current, and, retired, ipa, symbols, in, their, phonetic, symbol, guide, many, of, them, found, their, way, into, unicode, unicode, supports, nearly, all, of, the, ipa, apart, from, basic, latin, and, greek, and, general, punctuation, the, primary, blocks, are, ipa, extensions, spacing, modifier, letters, and, combining, diacritical, marks, with, lesser, support, from, phonetic, extensions, phonetic, extensions, supplement, combining, diacritical, marks, supplement, and, scattered, characters, elsewhere, the, extended, ipa, is, supported, primarily, by, those, blocks, and, latin, extended, g, after, the, kiel, convention, in, 1989, most, ipa, symbols, were, assigned, an, identifying, number, to, prevent, confusion, between, similar, characters, during, the, printing, of, manuscripts, the, codes, were, never, much, used, and, have, been, superseded, by, unicode, many, typefaces, have, support, for, ipa, characters, but, good, diacritic, rendering, remains, rare, web, browsers, generally, do, not, need, any, configuration, to, display, ipa, characters, provided, that, a, typeface, capable, of, doing, so, is, available, to, the, operating, system, typefaces, that, provide, full, ipa, and, nearly, full, extipa, support, including, properly, rendering, the, diacritics, include, gentium, plus, charis, sil, doulos, sil, and, andika, developed, by, sil, international, indeed, the, ipa, chose, doulos, to, publish, their, chart, in, unicode, format, in, addition, to, the, level, of, support, found, in, commercial, and, system, fonts, these, fonts, support, the, full, range, of, old, style, pre, kiel, staveless, tone, letters, through, a, character, variant, option, that, suppresses, the, stave, of, the, chao, tone, letters, they, also, have, an, option, to, maintain, the, vowel, distinction, in, italics, the, only, notable, gaps, are, with, the, extipa, the, combining, parentheses, which, enclose, diacritics, are, not, supported, nor, is, the, enclosing, circle, that, marks, unidentified, sounds, and, which, unicode, considers, to, be, a, copy, edit, mark, and, thus, not, eligible, for, unicode, support, the, basic, latin, noto, fonts, commissioned, by, google, also, have, decent, ipa, support, including, diacritic, placement, only, failing, with, the, more, obscure, ipa, and, extipa, characters, and, superscripts, of, the, latin, extended, f, and, latin, extended, g, blocks, the, extipa, parentheses, are, included, but, they, do, not, enclose, diacritics, as, they, are, supposed, to, dejavu, is, the, second, free, unicode, font, chosen, by, the, ipa, to, publish, their, chart, it, was, last, updated, in, 2016, and, so, does, not, support, the, latin, f, or, g, blocks, stacked, diacritics, tend, to, overstrike, each, other, as, of, 2018, the, ipa, was, developing, their, own, font, unitipa, based, on, tipa, calibri, the, default, font, of, microsoft, office, has, nearly, complete, ipa, support, with, good, diacritic, rendering, though, it, is, not, as, complete, as, some, free, fonts, see, image, at, right, other, widespread, microsoft, fonts, such, as, arial, and, times, new, roman, have, poor, support, the, apple, system, fonts, geneva, lucida, grande, and, hiragino, certain, weights, have, only, basic, ipa, support, brill, has, complete, ipa, and, extipa, coverage, of, characters, added, to, unicode, by, 2020, with, good, diacritic, and, tone, letter, support, it, is, a, commercial, font, but, is, freely, available, for, non, commercial, use, several, systems, have, been, developed, that, map, the, ipa, symbols, to, ascii, characters, notable, systems, include, sampa, and, x, sampa, the, usage, of, mapping, systems, in, on, line, text, has, to, some, extent, been, adopted, in, the, context, input, methods, allowing, convenient, keying, of, ipa, characters, that, would, be, otherwise, unavailable, on, standard, keyboard, layouts, ietf, language, tags, have, registered, fonipa, as, a, variant, subtag, identifying, text, as, written, in, ipa, thus, an, ipa, transcription, of, english, could, be, tagged, as, en, fonipa, for, the, use, of, ipa, without, attribution, to, a, concrete, language, und, fonipa, is, available, online, ipa, keyboard, utilities, are, available, though, none, of, them, cover, the, complete, range, of, ipa, symbols, and, diacritics, examples, are, the, ipa, 2018, i, charts, hosted, by, the, ipa, ipa, character, picker, by, richard, ishida, at, github, type, ipa, phonetic, symbols, at, typeit, org, and, an, ipa, chart, keyboard, by, weston, ruter, also, at, github, in, april, 2019, google, s, gboard, for, android, added, an, ipa, keyboard, to, its, platform, for, ios, there, are, multiple, free, keyboard, layouts, available, such, as, the, ipa, phonetic, keyboard, symbols, to, the, right, in, a, cell, are, voiced, to, the, left, are, voiceless, shaded, areas, denote, articulations, judged, impossible,
