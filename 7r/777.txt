in, social, psychology, a, stereotype, is, a, generalized, belief, about, a, particular, category, of, people, it, is, an, expectation, that, people, might, have, about, every, person, of, a, particular, group, the, type, of, expectation, can, vary, it, can, be, for, example, an, expectation, about, the, group, s, personality, preferences, appearance, or, ability, stereotypes, are, often, overgeneralized, inaccurate, and, resistant, to, new, information, a, stereotype, does, not, necessarily, need, to, be, a, negative, assumption, they, may, be, positive, neutral, or, negative, an, explicit, stereotype, refers, to, stereotypes, that, one, is, aware, that, one, holds, and, is, aware, that, one, is, using, to, judge, people, if, person, a, is, making, judgments, about, a, particular, person, b, from, group, g, and, person, a, has, an, explicit, stereotype, for, group, g, their, decision, bias, can, be, partially, mitigated, using, conscious, control, however, attempts, to, offset, bias, due, to, conscious, awareness, of, a, stereotype, often, fail, at, being, truly, impartial, due, to, either, underestimating, or, overestimating, the, amount, of, bias, being, created, by, the, stereotype, implicit, stereotypes, are, those, that, lay, on, individuals, subconsciousness, that, they, have, no, control, or, awareness, of, implicit, stereotypes, are, built, based, on, two, concepts, associative, networks, in, semantic, knowledge, memory, and, automatic, activation, implicit, stereotypes, are, automatic, and, involuntary, associations, that, people, make, between, a, social, group, and, a, domain, or, attribute, for, example, one, can, have, beliefs, that, women, and, men, are, equally, capable, of, becoming, successful, electricians, but, at, the, same, time, many, can, associate, electricians, more, with, men, than, women, in, social, psychology, a, stereotype, is, any, thought, widely, adopted, about, specific, types, of, individuals, or, certain, ways, of, behaving, intended, to, represent, the, entire, group, of, those, individuals, or, behaviors, as, a, whole, these, thoughts, or, beliefs, may, or, may, not, accurately, reflect, reality, within, psychology, and, across, other, disciplines, different, conceptualizations, and, theories, of, stereotyping, exist, at, times, sharing, commonalities, as, well, as, containing, contradictory, elements, even, in, the, social, sciences, and, some, sub, disciplines, of, psychology, stereotypes, are, occasionally, reproduced, and, can, be, identified, in, certain, theories, for, example, in, assumptions, about, other, cultures, the, term, stereotype, comes, from, the, french, adjective, st, r, otype, and, derives, from, the, greek, words, stereos, firm, solid, and, typos, impression, hence, solid, impression, on, one, or, more, ideas, theories, the, term, was, first, used, in, the, printing, trade, in, 1798, by, firmin, didot, to, describe, a, printing, plate, that, duplicated, any, typography, the, duplicate, printing, plate, or, the, stereotype, is, used, for, printing, instead, of, the, original, outside, of, printing, the, first, reference, to, stereotype, in, english, was, in, 1850, as, a, noun, that, meant, image, perpetuated, without, change, however, it, was, not, until, 1922, that, stereotype, was, first, used, in, the, modern, psychological, sense, by, american, journalist, walter, lippmann, in, his, work, public, opinion, stereotypes, prejudice, racism, and, discrimination, are, understood, as, related, but, different, concepts, stereotypes, are, regarded, as, the, most, cognitive, component, and, often, occurs, without, conscious, awareness, whereas, prejudice, is, the, affective, component, of, stereotyping, and, discrimination, is, one, of, the, behavioral, components, of, prejudicial, reactions, in, this, tripartite, view, of, intergroup, attitudes, stereotypes, reflect, expectations, and, beliefs, about, the, members, of, groups, perceived, as, different, from, one, s, own, prejudice, represents, the, emotional, response, and, discrimination, refers, to, actions, although, related, the, three, concepts, can, exist, independently, of, each, other, according, to, daniel, katz, and, kenneth, braly, stereotyping, leads, to, racial, prejudice, when, people, emotionally, react, to, the, name, of, a, group, ascribe, characteristics, to, members, of, that, group, and, then, evaluate, those, characteristics, possible, prejudicial, effects, of, stereotypes, are, stereotype, content, refers, to, the, attributes, that, people, think, characterize, a, group, studies, of, stereotype, content, examine, what, people, think, of, others, rather, than, the, reasons, and, mechanisms, involved, in, stereotyping, early, theories, of, stereotype, content, proposed, by, social, psychologists, such, as, gordon, allport, assumed, that, stereotypes, of, outgroups, reflected, uniform, antipathy, for, instance, katz, and, braly, argued, in, their, classic, 1933, study, that, ethnic, stereotypes, were, uniformly, negative, by, contrast, a, newer, model, of, stereotype, content, theorizes, that, stereotypes, are, frequently, ambivalent, and, vary, along, two, dimensions, warmth, and, competence, warmth, and, competence, are, respectively, predicted, by, lack, of, competition, and, status, groups, that, do, not, compete, with, the, in, group, for, the, same, resources, e, g, college, space, are, perceived, as, warm, whereas, high, status, e, g, economically, or, educationally, successful, groups, are, considered, competent, the, groups, within, each, of, the, four, combinations, of, high, and, low, levels, of, warmth, and, competence, elicit, distinct, emotions, the, model, explains, the, phenomenon, that, some, out, groups, are, admired, but, disliked, whereas, others, are, liked, but, disrespected, this, model, was, empirically, tested, on, a, variety, of, national, and, international, samples, and, was, found, to, reliably, predict, stereotype, content, an, even, more, recent, model, of, stereotype, content, called, the, agency, beliefs, communion, abc, model, suggested, that, methods, to, study, warmth, and, competence, in, the, stereotype, content, model, scm, were, missing, a, crucial, element, that, being, stereotypes, of, social, groups, are, often, spontaneously, generated, experiments, on, the, scm, usually, ask, participants, to, rate, traits, according, to, warmth, and, competence, but, this, does, not, allow, participants, to, use, any, other, stereotype, dimensions, the, abc, model, proposed, by, koch, and, colleagues, in, 2016, is, an, estimate, of, how, people, spontaneously, stereotype, u, s, social, groups, of, people, using, traits, koch, et, al, conducted, several, studies, asking, participants, to, list, groups, and, sort, them, according, to, their, similarity, using, statistical, techniques, they, revealed, three, dimensions, that, explained, the, similarity, ratings, these, three, dimensions, were, agency, a, beliefs, b, and, communion, c, agency, is, associated, with, reaching, goals, standing, out, and, socio, economic, status, and, is, related, to, competence, in, the, scm, with, some, examples, of, traits, including, poor, and, wealthy, powerful, and, powerless, low, status, and, high, status, beliefs, is, associated, with, views, on, the, world, morals, and, conservative, progressive, beliefs, with, some, examples, of, traits, including, traditional, and, modern, religious, and, science, oriented, or, conventional, and, alternative, finally, communion, is, associated, with, connecting, with, others, and, fitting, in, and, is, similar, to, warmth, from, the, scm, with, some, examples, of, traits, including, trustworthy, and, untrustworthy, cold, and, warm, and, repellent, and, likeable, according, to, research, using, this, model, there, is, a, curvilinear, relationship, between, agency, and, communion, for, example, if, a, group, is, high, or, low, in, the, agency, dimension, then, they, may, be, seen, as, un, communal, whereas, groups, that, are, average, in, agency, are, seen, as, more, communal, this, model, has, many, implications, in, predicting, behaviour, towards, stereotyped, groups, for, example, koch, and, colleagues, recently, proposed, that, perceived, similarity, in, agency, and, beliefs, increases, inter, group, cooperation, early, studies, suggested, that, stereotypes, were, only, used, by, rigid, repressed, and, authoritarian, people, this, idea, has, been, refuted, by, contemporary, studies, that, suggest, the, ubiquity, of, stereotypes, and, it, was, suggested, to, regard, stereotypes, as, collective, group, beliefs, meaning, that, people, who, belong, to, the, same, social, group, share, the, same, set, of, stereotypes, modern, research, asserts, that, full, understanding, of, stereotypes, requires, considering, them, from, two, complementary, perspectives, as, shared, within, a, particular, culture, subculture, and, as, formed, in, the, mind, of, an, individual, person, stereotyping, can, serve, cognitive, functions, on, an, interpersonal, level, and, social, functions, on, an, intergroup, level, for, stereotyping, to, function, on, an, intergroup, level, see, social, identity, approaches, social, identity, theory, and, self, categorization, theory, an, individual, must, see, themselves, as, part, of, a, group, and, being, part, of, that, group, must, also, be, salient, for, the, individual, craig, mcgarty, russell, spears, and, vincent, y, yzerbyt, 2002, argued, that, the, cognitive, functions, of, stereotyping, are, best, understood, in, relation, to, its, social, functions, and, vice, versa, stereotypes, can, help, make, sense, of, the, world, they, are, a, form, of, categorization, that, helps, to, simplify, and, systematize, information, thus, information, is, more, easily, identified, recalled, predicted, and, reacted, to, stereotypes, are, categories, of, objects, or, people, between, stereotypes, objects, or, people, are, as, different, from, each, other, as, possible, within, stereotypes, objects, or, people, are, as, similar, to, each, other, as, possible, gordon, allport, has, suggested, possible, answers, to, why, people, find, it, easier, to, understand, categorized, information, first, people, can, consult, a, category, to, identify, response, patterns, second, categorized, information, is, more, specific, than, non, categorized, information, as, categorization, accentuates, properties, that, are, shared, by, all, members, of, a, group, third, people, can, readily, describe, objects, in, a, category, because, objects, in, the, same, category, have, distinct, characteristics, finally, people, can, take, for, granted, the, characteristics, of, a, particular, category, because, the, category, itself, may, be, an, arbitrary, grouping, a, complementary, perspective, theorizes, how, stereotypes, function, as, time, and, energy, savers, that, allow, people, to, act, more, efficiently, yet, another, perspective, suggests, that, stereotypes, are, people, s, biased, perceptions, of, their, social, contexts, in, this, view, people, use, stereotypes, as, shortcuts, to, make, sense, of, their, social, contexts, and, this, makes, a, person, s, task, of, understanding, his, or, her, world, less, cognitively, demanding, in, the, following, situations, the, overarching, purpose, of, stereotyping, is, for, people, to, put, their, collective, self, their, in, group, membership, in, a, positive, light, as, mentioned, previously, stereotypes, can, be, used, to, explain, social, events, henri, tajfel, described, his, observations, of, how, some, people, found, that, the, antisemitic, fabricated, contents, of, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, only, made, sense, if, jews, have, certain, characteristics, therefore, according, to, tajfel, jews, were, stereotyped, as, being, evil, and, yearning, for, world, domination, to, match, the, antisemitic, facts, as, presented, in, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, people, create, stereotypes, of, an, outgroup, to, justify, the, actions, that, their, in, group, has, committed, or, plans, to, commit, towards, that, outgroup, for, example, according, to, tajfel, europeans, stereotyped, african, indian, and, chinese, people, as, being, incapable, of, achieving, financial, advances, without, european, help, this, stereotype, was, used, to, justify, european, colonialism, in, africa, india, and, china, an, assumption, is, that, people, want, their, ingroup, to, have, a, positive, image, relative, to, outgroups, and, so, people, want, to, differentiate, their, ingroup, from, relevant, outgroups, in, a, desirable, way, if, an, outgroup, does, not, affect, the, ingroup, s, image, then, from, an, image, preservation, point, of, view, there, is, no, point, for, the, ingroup, to, be, positively, distinct, from, that, outgroup, people, can, actively, create, certain, images, for, relevant, outgroups, by, stereotyping, people, do, so, when, they, see, that, their, ingroup, is, no, longer, as, clearly, and, or, as, positively, differentiated, from, relevant, outgroups, and, they, want, to, restore, the, intergroup, differentiation, to, a, state, that, favours, the, ingroup, stereotypes, can, emphasize, a, person, s, group, membership, in, two, steps, stereotypes, emphasize, the, person, s, similarities, with, ingroup, members, on, relevant, dimensions, and, also, the, person, s, differences, from, outgroup, members, on, relevant, dimensions, people, change, the, stereotype, of, their, ingroups, and, outgroups, to, suit, context, once, an, outgroup, treats, an, ingroup, member, badly, they, are, more, drawn, to, the, members, of, their, own, group, this, can, be, seen, as, members, within, a, group, are, able, to, relate, to, each, other, though, a, stereotype, because, of, identical, situations, a, person, can, embrace, a, stereotype, to, avoid, humiliation, such, as, failing, a, task, and, blaming, it, on, a, stereotype, stereotypes, are, an, indicator, of, ingroup, consensus, when, there, are, intragroup, disagreements, over, stereotypes, of, the, ingroup, and, or, outgroups, ingroup, members, take, collective, action, to, prevent, other, ingroup, members, from, diverging, from, each, other, john, c, turner, proposed, in, 1987, that, if, ingroup, members, disagree, on, an, outgroup, stereotype, then, one, of, three, possible, collective, actions, follow, first, ingroup, members, may, negotiate, with, each, other, and, conclude, that, they, have, different, outgroup, stereotypes, because, they, are, stereotyping, different, subgroups, of, an, outgroup, e, g, russian, gymnasts, versus, russian, boxers, second, ingroup, members, may, negotiate, with, each, other, but, conclude, that, they, are, disagreeing, because, of, categorical, differences, amongst, themselves, accordingly, in, this, context, it, is, better, to, categorise, ingroup, members, under, different, categories, e, g, democrats, versus, republican, than, under, a, shared, category, e, g, american, finally, ingroup, members, may, influence, each, other, to, arrive, at, a, common, outgroup, stereotype, different, disciplines, give, different, accounts, of, how, stereotypes, develop, psychologists, may, focus, on, an, individual, s, experience, with, groups, patterns, of, communication, about, those, groups, and, intergroup, conflict, as, for, sociologists, they, may, focus, on, the, relations, among, different, groups, in, a, social, structure, they, suggest, that, stereotypes, are, the, result, of, conflict, poor, parenting, and, inadequate, mental, and, emotional, development, once, stereotypes, have, formed, there, are, two, main, factors, that, explain, their, persistence, first, the, cognitive, effects, of, schematic, processing, see, schema, make, it, so, that, when, a, member, of, a, group, behaves, as, we, expect, the, behavior, confirms, and, even, strengthens, existing, stereotypes, second, the, affective, or, emotional, aspects, of, prejudice, render, logical, arguments, against, stereotypes, ineffective, in, countering, the, power, of, emotional, responses, correspondence, bias, refers, to, the, tendency, to, ascribe, a, person, s, behavior, to, disposition, or, personality, and, to, underestimate, the, extent, to, which, situational, factors, elicited, the, behavior, correspondence, bias, can, play, an, important, role, in, stereotype, formation, for, example, in, a, study, by, roguer, and, yzerbyt, 1999, participants, watched, a, video, showing, students, who, were, randomly, instructed, to, find, arguments, either, for, or, against, euthanasia, the, students, that, argued, in, favor, of, euthanasia, came, from, the, same, law, department, or, from, different, departments, results, showed, that, participants, attributed, the, students, responses, to, their, attitudes, although, it, had, been, made, clear, in, the, video, that, students, had, no, choice, about, their, position, participants, reported, that, group, membership, i, e, the, department, that, the, students, belonged, to, affected, the, students, opinions, about, euthanasia, law, students, were, perceived, to, be, more, in, favor, of, euthanasia, than, students, from, different, departments, despite, the, fact, that, a, pretest, had, revealed, that, subjects, had, no, preexisting, expectations, about, attitudes, toward, euthanasia, and, the, department, that, students, belong, to, the, attribution, error, created, the, new, stereotype, that, law, students, are, more, likely, to, support, euthanasia, nier, et, al, 2012, found, that, people, who, tend, to, draw, dispositional, inferences, from, behavior, and, ignore, situational, constraints, are, more, likely, to, stereotype, low, status, groups, as, incompetent, and, high, status, groups, as, competent, participants, listened, to, descriptions, of, two, fictitious, groups, of, pacific, islanders, one, of, which, was, described, as, being, higher, in, status, than, the, other, in, a, second, study, subjects, rated, actual, groups, the, poor, and, wealthy, women, and, men, in, the, united, states, in, terms, of, their, competence, subjects, who, scored, high, on, the, measure, of, correspondence, bias, stereotyped, the, poor, women, and, the, fictitious, lower, status, pacific, islanders, as, incompetent, whereas, they, stereotyped, the, wealthy, men, and, the, high, status, pacific, islanders, as, competent, the, correspondence, bias, was, a, significant, predictor, of, stereotyping, even, after, controlling, for, other, measures, that, have, been, linked, to, beliefs, about, low, status, groups, the, just, world, fallacy, and, social, dominance, orientation, based, on, the, anti, public, sector, bias, d, ring, and, willems, 2021, found, that, employees, in, the, public, sector, are, considered, as, less, professional, compared, to, employees, in, the, private, sector, they, build, on, the, assumption, that, the, red, tape, and, bureaucratic, nature, of, the, public, sector, spills, over, in, the, perception, that, citizens, have, about, the, employees, working, in, the, sector, with, an, experimental, vignette, study, they, analyze, how, citizens, process, information, on, employees, sector, affiliation, and, integrate, non, work, role, referencing, to, test, the, stereotype, confirmation, assumption, underlying, the, representativeness, heuristic, the, results, show, that, sector, as, well, as, non, work, role, referencing, influences, perceived, employee, professionalism, but, has, little, effect, on, the, confirmation, of, particular, public, sector, stereotypes, moreover, the, results, do, not, confirm, a, congruity, effect, of, consistent, stereotypical, information, non, work, role, referencing, does, not, aggravate, the, negative, effect, of, sector, affiliation, on, perceived, employee, professionalism, research, has, shown, that, stereotypes, can, develop, based, on, a, cognitive, mechanism, known, as, illusory, correlation, an, erroneous, inference, about, the, relationship, between, two, events, if, two, statistically, infrequent, events, co, occur, observers, overestimate, the, frequency, of, co, occurrence, of, these, events, the, underlying, reason, is, that, rare, infrequent, events, are, distinctive, and, salient, and, when, paired, become, even, more, so, the, heightened, salience, results, in, more, attention, and, more, effective, encoding, which, strengthens, the, belief, that, the, events, are, correlated, in, the, inter, group, context, illusory, correlations, lead, people, to, misattribute, rare, behaviors, or, traits, at, higher, rates, to, minority, group, members, than, to, majority, groups, even, when, both, display, the, same, proportion, of, the, behaviors, or, traits, black, people, for, instance, are, a, minority, group, in, the, united, states, and, interaction, with, blacks, is, a, relatively, infrequent, event, for, an, average, white, american, similarly, undesirable, behavior, e, g, crime, is, statistically, less, frequent, than, desirable, behavior, since, both, events, blackness, and, undesirable, behavior, are, distinctive, in, the, sense, that, they, are, infrequent, the, combination, of, the, two, leads, observers, to, overestimate, the, rate, of, co, occurrence, similarly, in, workplaces, where, women, are, underrepresented, and, negative, behaviors, such, as, errors, occur, less, frequently, than, positive, behaviors, women, become, more, strongly, associated, with, mistakes, than, men, in, a, landmark, study, david, hamilton, and, richard, gifford, 1976, examined, the, role, of, illusory, correlation, in, stereotype, formation, subjects, were, instructed, to, read, descriptions, of, behaviors, performed, by, members, of, groups, a, and, b, negative, behaviors, outnumbered, positive, actions, and, group, b, was, smaller, than, group, a, making, negative, behaviors, and, membership, in, group, b, relatively, infrequent, and, distinctive, participants, were, then, asked, who, had, performed, a, set, of, actions, a, person, of, group, a, or, group, b, results, showed, that, subjects, overestimated, the, frequency, with, which, both, distinctive, events, membership, in, group, b, and, negative, behavior, co, occurred, and, evaluated, group, b, more, negatively, this, despite, the, fact, the, proportion, of, positive, to, negative, behaviors, was, equivalent, for, both, groups, and, that, there, was, no, actual, correlation, between, group, membership, and, behaviors, although, hamilton, and, gifford, found, a, similar, effect, for, positive, behaviors, as, the, infrequent, events, a, meta, analytic, review, of, studies, showed, that, illusory, correlation, effects, are, stronger, when, the, infrequent, distinctive, information, is, negative, hamilton, and, gifford, s, distinctiveness, based, explanation, of, stereotype, formation, was, subsequently, extended, a, 1994, study, by, mcconnell, sherman, and, hamilton, found, that, people, formed, stereotypes, based, on, information, that, was, not, distinctive, at, the, time, of, presentation, but, was, considered, distinctive, at, the, time, of, judgement, once, a, person, judges, non, distinctive, information, in, memory, to, be, distinctive, that, information, is, re, encoded, and, re, represented, as, if, it, had, been, distinctive, when, it, was, first, processed, one, explanation, for, why, stereotypes, are, shared, is, that, they, are, the, result, of, a, common, environment, that, stimulates, people, to, react, in, the, same, way, the, problem, with, the, common, environment, is, that, explanation, in, general, is, that, it, does, not, explain, how, shared, stereotypes, can, occur, without, direct, stimuli, research, since, the, 1930s, suggested, that, people, are, highly, similar, with, each, other, in, how, they, describe, different, racial, and, national, groups, although, those, people, have, no, personal, experience, with, the, groups, they, are, describing, another, explanation, says, that, people, are, socialised, to, adopt, the, same, stereotypes, some, psychologists, believe, that, although, stereotypes, can, be, absorbed, at, any, age, stereotypes, are, usually, acquired, in, early, childhood, under, the, influence, of, parents, teachers, peers, and, the, media, if, stereotypes, are, defined, by, social, values, then, stereotypes, only, change, as, per, changes, in, social, values, the, suggestion, that, stereotype, content, depends, on, social, values, reflects, walter, lippman, s, argument, in, his, 1922, publication, that, stereotypes, are, rigid, because, they, cannot, be, changed, at, will, studies, emerging, since, the, 1940s, refuted, the, suggestion, that, stereotype, contents, cannot, be, changed, at, will, those, studies, suggested, that, one, group, s, stereotype, of, another, group, would, become, more, or, less, positive, depending, on, whether, their, intergroup, relationship, had, improved, or, degraded, intergroup, events, e, g, world, war, ii, persian, gulf, conflicts, often, changed, intergroup, relationships, for, example, after, wwii, black, american, students, held, a, more, negative, stereotype, of, people, from, countries, that, were, the, united, states, s, wwii, enemies, if, there, are, no, changes, to, an, intergroup, relationship, then, relevant, stereotypes, do, not, change, according, to, a, third, explanation, shared, stereotypes, are, neither, caused, by, the, coincidence, of, common, stimuli, nor, by, socialisation, this, explanation, posits, that, stereotypes, are, shared, because, group, members, are, motivated, to, behave, in, certain, ways, and, stereotypes, reflect, those, behaviours, it, is, important, to, note, from, this, explanation, that, stereotypes, are, the, consequence, not, the, cause, of, intergroup, relations, this, explanation, assumes, that, when, it, is, important, for, people, to, acknowledge, both, their, ingroup, and, outgroup, they, will, emphasise, their, difference, from, outgroup, members, and, their, similarity, to, ingroup, members, international, migration, creates, more, opportunities, for, intergroup, relations, but, the, interactions, do, not, always, disconfirm, stereotypes, they, are, also, known, to, form, and, maintain, them, the, dual, process, model, of, cognitive, processing, of, stereotypes, asserts, that, automatic, activation, of, stereotypes, is, followed, by, a, controlled, processing, stage, during, which, an, individual, may, choose, to, disregard, or, ignore, the, stereotyped, information, that, has, been, brought, to, mind, a, number, of, studies, have, found, that, stereotypes, are, activated, automatically, patricia, devine, 1989, for, example, suggested, that, stereotypes, are, automatically, activated, in, the, presence, of, a, member, or, some, symbolic, equivalent, of, a, stereotyped, group, and, that, the, unintentional, activation, of, the, stereotype, is, equally, strong, for, high, and, low, prejudice, persons, words, related, to, the, cultural, stereotype, of, blacks, were, presented, subliminally, during, an, ostensibly, unrelated, impression, formation, task, subjects, read, a, paragraph, describing, a, race, unspecified, target, person, s, behaviors, and, rated, the, target, person, on, several, trait, scales, results, showed, that, participants, who, received, a, high, proportion, of, racial, words, rated, the, target, person, in, the, story, as, significantly, more, hostile, than, participants, who, were, presented, with, a, lower, proportion, of, words, related, to, the, stereotype, this, effect, held, true, for, both, high, and, low, prejudice, subjects, as, measured, by, the, modern, racism, scale, thus, the, racial, stereotype, was, activated, even, for, low, prejudice, individuals, who, did, not, personally, endorse, it, studies, using, alternative, priming, methods, have, shown, that, the, activation, of, gender, and, age, stereotypes, can, also, be, automatic, subsequent, research, suggested, that, the, relation, between, category, activation, and, stereotype, activation, was, more, complex, lepore, and, brown, 1997, for, instance, noted, that, the, words, used, in, devine, s, study, were, both, neutral, category, labels, e, g, blacks, and, stereotypic, attributes, e, g, lazy, they, argued, that, if, only, the, neutral, category, labels, were, presented, people, high, and, low, in, prejudice, would, respond, differently, in, a, design, similar, to, devine, s, lepore, and, brown, primed, the, category, of, african, americans, using, labels, such, as, blacks, and, west, indians, and, then, assessed, the, differential, activation, of, the, associated, stereotype, in, the, subsequent, impression, formation, task, they, found, that, high, prejudice, participants, increased, their, ratings, of, the, target, person, on, the, negative, stereotypic, dimensions, and, decreased, them, on, the, positive, dimension, whereas, low, prejudice, subjects, tended, in, the, opposite, direction, the, results, suggest, that, the, level, of, prejudice, and, stereotype, endorsement, affects, people, s, judgements, when, the, category, and, not, the, stereotype, per, se, is, primed, research, has, shown, that, people, can, be, trained, to, activate, counterstereotypic, information, and, thereby, reduce, the, automatic, activation, of, negative, stereotypes, in, a, study, by, kawakami, et, al, 2000, for, example, participants, were, presented, with, a, category, label, and, taught, to, respond, no, to, stereotypic, traits, and, yes, to, nonstereotypic, traits, after, this, training, period, subjects, showed, reduced, stereotype, activation, this, effect, is, based, on, the, learning, of, new, and, more, positive, stereotypes, rather, than, the, negation, of, already, existing, ones, empirical, evidence, suggests, that, stereotype, activation, can, automatically, influence, social, behavior, for, example, bargh, chen, and, burrows, 1996, activated, the, stereotype, of, the, elderly, among, half, of, their, participants, by, administering, a, scrambled, sentence, test, where, participants, saw, words, related, to, age, stereotypes, subjects, primed, with, the, stereotype, walked, significantly, more, slowly, than, the, control, group, although, the, test, did, not, include, any, words, specifically, referring, to, slowness, thus, acting, in, a, way, that, the, stereotype, suggests, that, elderly, people, will, act, and, the, stereotype, of, the, elder, will, affect, the, subjective, perception, of, them, through, depression, in, another, experiment, bargh, chen, and, burrows, also, found, that, because, the, stereotype, about, blacks, includes, the, notion, of, aggression, subliminal, exposure, to, black, faces, increased, the, likelihood, that, randomly, selected, white, college, students, reacted, with, more, aggression, and, hostility, than, participants, who, subconsciously, viewed, a, white, face, similarly, correll, et, al, 2002, showed, that, activated, stereotypes, about, blacks, can, influence, people, s, behavior, in, a, series, of, experiments, black, and, white, participants, played, a, video, game, in, which, a, black, or, white, person, was, shown, holding, a, gun, or, a, harmless, object, e, g, a, mobile, phone, participants, had, to, decide, as, quickly, as, possible, whether, to, shoot, the, target, when, the, target, person, was, armed, both, black, and, white, participants, were, faster, in, deciding, to, shoot, the, target, when, he, was, black, than, when, he, was, white, when, the, target, was, unarmed, the, participants, avoided, shooting, him, more, quickly, when, he, was, white, time, pressure, made, the, shooter, bias, even, more, pronounced, stereotypes, can, be, efficient, shortcuts, and, sense, making, tools, they, can, however, keep, people, from, processing, new, or, unexpected, information, about, each, individual, thus, biasing, the, impression, formation, process, early, researchers, believed, that, stereotypes, were, inaccurate, representations, of, reality, a, series, of, pioneering, studies, in, the, 1930s, found, no, empirical, support, for, widely, held, racial, stereotypes, by, the, mid, 1950s, gordon, allport, wrote, that, it, is, possible, for, a, stereotype, to, grow, in, defiance, of, all, evidence, research, on, the, role, of, illusory, correlations, in, the, formation, of, stereotypes, suggests, that, stereotypes, can, develop, because, of, incorrect, inferences, about, the, relationship, between, two, events, e, g, membership, in, a, social, group, and, bad, or, good, attributes, this, means, that, at, least, some, stereotypes, are, inaccurate, a, 1995, book, by, yueh, ting, lee, et, al, argued, that, stereotypes, are, sometimes, accurate, similarly, a, 2015, study, by, jussim, et, al, reviewed, four, studies, of, racial, stereotypes, and, seven, studies, of, gender, stereotypes, regarding, demographic, characteristics, academic, achievement, personality, and, behavior, and, argued, that, some, aspects, of, ethnic, and, gender, stereotypes, are, accurate, while, stereotypes, concerning, political, affiliation, and, nationality, are, much, less, accurate, a, 2005, study, by, terracciano, et, al, found, that, stereotypic, beliefs, about, nationality, do, not, reflect, the, actual, personality, traits, of, people, from, different, cultures, in, a, 1973, paper, marlene, mackie, argued, that, while, stereotypes, are, inaccurate, this, is, a, definition, rather, than, empirical, claim, stereotypes, were, simply, defined, as, inaccurate, even, though, the, supposed, inaccuracy, of, stereotypes, was, treated, as, though, it, was, an, empirical, discovery, attributive, ambiguity, refers, to, the, uncertainty, that, members, of, stereotyped, groups, experience, in, interpreting, the, causes, of, others, behavior, toward, them, stereotyped, individuals, who, receive, negative, feedback, can, attribute, it, either, to, personal, shortcomings, such, as, lack, of, ability, or, poor, effort, or, the, evaluator, s, stereotypes, and, prejudice, toward, their, social, group, alternatively, positive, feedback, can, either, be, attributed, to, personal, merit, or, discounted, as, a, form, of, sympathy, or, pity, crocker, et, al, 1991, showed, that, when, black, participants, were, evaluated, by, a, white, person, who, was, aware, of, their, race, black, subjects, mistrusted, the, feedback, attributing, negative, feedback, to, the, evaluator, s, stereotypes, and, positive, feedback, to, the, evaluator, s, desire, to, appear, unbiased, when, the, black, participants, race, was, unknown, to, the, evaluator, they, were, more, accepting, of, the, feedback, attributional, ambiguity, has, been, shown, to, affect, a, person, s, self, esteem, when, they, receive, positive, evaluations, stereotyped, individuals, are, uncertain, of, whether, they, really, deserved, their, success, and, consequently, they, find, it, difficult, to, take, credit, for, their, achievements, in, the, case, of, negative, feedback, ambiguity, has, been, shown, to, have, a, protective, effect, on, self, esteem, as, it, allows, people, to, assign, blame, to, external, causes, some, studies, however, have, found, that, this, effect, only, holds, when, stereotyped, individuals, can, be, absolutely, certain, that, their, negative, outcomes, are, due, to, the, evaluators, s, prejudice, if, any, room, for, uncertainty, remains, stereotyped, individuals, tend, to, blame, themselves, attributional, ambiguity, can, also, make, it, difficult, to, assess, one, s, skills, because, performance, related, evaluations, are, mistrusted, or, discounted, moreover, it, can, lead, to, the, belief, that, one, s, efforts, are, not, directly, linked, to, the, outcomes, thereby, depressing, one, s, motivation, to, succeed, stereotype, threat, occurs, when, people, are, aware, of, a, negative, stereotype, about, their, social, group, and, experience, anxiety, or, concern, that, they, might, confirm, the, stereotype, stereotype, threat, has, been, shown, to, undermine, performance, in, a, variety, of, domains, claude, m, steele, and, joshua, aronson, conducted, the, first, experiments, showing, that, stereotype, threat, can, depress, intellectual, performance, on, standardized, tests, in, one, study, they, found, that, black, college, students, performed, worse, than, white, students, on, a, verbal, test, when, the, task, was, framed, as, a, measure, of, intelligence, when, it, was, not, presented, in, that, manner, the, performance, gap, narrowed, subsequent, experiments, showed, that, framing, the, test, as, diagnostic, of, intellectual, ability, made, black, students, more, aware, of, negative, stereotypes, about, their, group, which, in, turn, impaired, their, performance, stereotype, threat, effects, have, been, demonstrated, for, an, array, of, social, groups, in, many, different, arenas, including, not, only, academics, but, also, sports, chess, and, business, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, stereotype, threat, should, not, be, interpreted, as, a, factor, in, real, life, performance, gaps, and, have, raised, the, possibility, of, publication, bias, other, critics, have, focused, on, correcting, what, they, claim, are, misconceptions, of, early, studies, showing, a, large, effect, however, meta, analyses, and, systematic, reviews, have, shown, significant, evidence, for, the, effects, of, stereotype, threat, though, the, phenomenon, defies, over, simplistic, characterization, stereotypes, lead, people, to, expect, certain, actions, from, members, of, social, groups, these, stereotype, based, expectations, may, lead, to, self, fulfilling, prophecies, in, which, one, s, inaccurate, expectations, about, a, person, s, behavior, through, social, interaction, prompt, that, person, to, act, in, stereotype, consistent, ways, thus, confirming, one, s, erroneous, expectations, and, validating, the, stereotype, word, zanna, and, cooper, 1974, demonstrated, the, effects, of, stereotypes, in, the, context, of, a, job, interview, white, participants, interviewed, black, and, white, subjects, who, prior, to, the, experiments, had, been, trained, to, act, in, a, standardized, manner, analysis, of, the, videotaped, interviews, showed, that, black, job, applicants, were, treated, differently, they, received, shorter, amounts, of, interview, time, and, less, eye, contact, interviewers, made, more, speech, errors, e, g, stutters, sentence, incompletions, incoherent, sounds, and, physically, distanced, themselves, from, black, applicants, in, a, second, experiment, trained, interviewers, were, instructed, to, treat, applicants, all, of, whom, were, white, like, the, whites, or, blacks, had, been, treated, in, the, first, experiment, as, a, result, applicants, treated, like, the, blacks, of, the, first, experiment, behaved, in, a, more, nervous, manner, and, received, more, negative, performance, ratings, than, interviewees, receiving, the, treatment, previously, afforded, to, whites, a, 1977, study, by, snyder, tanke, and, berscheid, found, a, similar, pattern, in, social, interactions, between, men, and, women, male, undergraduate, students, were, asked, to, talk, to, female, undergraduates, whom, they, believed, to, be, physically, attractive, or, unattractive, on, the, phone, the, conversations, were, taped, and, analysis, showed, that, men, who, thought, that, they, were, talking, to, an, attractive, woman, communicated, in, a, more, positive, and, friendlier, manner, than, men, who, believed, that, they, were, talking, to, unattractive, women, this, altered, the, women, s, behavior, female, subjects, who, unknowingly, to, them, were, perceived, to, be, physically, attractive, behaved, in, a, friendly, likeable, and, sociable, manner, in, comparison, with, subjects, who, were, regarded, as, unattractive, a, 2005, study, by, j, thomas, kellow, and, brett, d, jones, looked, at, the, effects, of, self, fulfilling, prophecy, on, african, american, and, caucasian, high, school, freshman, students, both, white, and, black, students, were, informed, that, their, test, performance, would, be, predictive, of, their, performance, on, a, statewide, high, stakes, standardized, test, they, were, also, told, that, historically, white, students, had, outperformed, black, students, on, the, test, this, knowledge, created, a, self, fulfilling, prophecy, in, both, the, white, and, black, students, where, the, white, students, scored, statistically, significantly, higher, than, the, african, american, students, on, the, test, the, stereotype, threat, of, underperforming, on, standardized, tests, affected, the, african, american, students, in, this, study, in, accountancy, there, is, a, popular, stereotype, which, represents, members, of, the, profession, as, being, humorless, introspective, beancounters, because, stereotypes, simplify, and, justify, social, reality, they, have, potentially, powerful, effects, on, how, people, perceive, and, treat, one, another, as, a, result, stereotypes, can, lead, to, discrimination, in, labor, markets, and, other, domains, for, example, tilcsik, 2011, has, found, that, employers, who, seek, job, applicants, with, stereotypically, male, heterosexual, traits, are, particularly, likely, to, engage, in, discrimination, against, gay, men, suggesting, that, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, sexual, orientation, is, partly, rooted, in, specific, stereotypes, and, that, these, stereotypes, loom, large, in, many, labor, markets, agerstr, m, and, rooth, 2011, showed, that, automatic, obesity, stereotypes, captured, by, the, implicit, association, test, can, predict, real, hiring, discrimination, against, the, obese, similarly, experiments, suggest, that, gender, stereotypes, play, an, important, role, in, judgments, that, affect, hiring, decisions, stereotypes, can, cause, racist, prejudice, for, example, scientists, and, activists, have, warned, that, the, use, of, the, stereotype, nigerian, prince, for, referring, to, advance, fee, scammers, is, racist, i, e, reducing, nigeria, to, a, nation, of, scammers, and, fraudulent, princes, as, some, people, still, do, online, is, a, stereotype, that, needs, to, be, called, out, stereotypes, can, affect, self, evaluations, and, lead, to, self, stereotyping, for, instance, correll, 2001, 2004, found, that, specific, stereotypes, e, g, the, stereotype, that, women, have, lower, mathematical, ability, affect, women, s, and, men, s, evaluations, of, their, abilities, e, g, in, math, and, science, such, that, men, assess, their, own, task, ability, higher, than, women, performing, at, the, same, level, similarly, a, study, by, sinclair, et, al, 2006, has, shown, that, asian, american, women, rated, their, math, ability, more, favorably, when, their, ethnicity, and, the, relevant, stereotype, that, asian, americans, excel, in, math, was, made, salient, in, contrast, they, rated, their, math, ability, less, favorably, when, their, gender, and, the, corresponding, stereotype, of, women, s, inferior, math, skills, was, made, salient, sinclair, et, al, found, however, that, the, effect, of, stereotypes, on, self, evaluations, is, mediated, by, the, degree, to, which, close, people, in, someone, s, life, endorse, these, stereotypes, people, s, self, stereotyping, can, increase, or, decrease, depending, on, whether, close, others, view, them, in, stereotype, consistent, or, inconsistent, manner, stereotyping, can, also, play, a, central, role, in, depression, when, people, have, negative, self, stereotypes, about, themselves, according, to, cox, abramson, devine, and, hollon, 2012, stereotyping, can, also, play, a, central, role, in, depression, which, is, characterized, by, negative, self, schemas, stereotypes, and, self, schemas, are, the, same, type, of, cognitive, structure, therefore, they, suggest, that, an, integrated, perspective, of, prejudice, and, depression, provides, useful, insight, on, how, stereotypes, are, acquired, negative, stereotypes, are, set, in, motion, within, the, source, who, conveys, the, prejudice, towards, the, target, which, in, turn, will, lead, the, target, to, suffer, from, depression, members, of, stigmatized, groups, may, internalize, the, negative, evaluation, of, their, group, and, develop, depression, people, may, also, show, prejudice, internalization, through, self, stereotyping, because, of, negative, childhood, experiences, such, as, verbal, and, physical, abuse, this, depression, that, is, caused, by, prejudice, i, e, deprejudice, can, be, related, to, group, membership, e, g, me, gay, bad, or, not, e, g, me, bad, if, someone, holds, prejudicial, beliefs, about, a, stigmatized, group, and, then, becomes, a, member, of, that, group, they, may, internalize, their, prejudice, and, develop, depression, people, may, also, show, prejudice, internalization, through, self, stereotyping, because, of, negative, childhood, experiences, such, as, verbal, and, physical, abuse, stereotypes, are, traditional, and, familiar, symbol, clusters, expressing, a, more, or, less, complex, idea, in, a, convenient, way, they, are, often, simplistic, pronouncements, about, gender, racial, ethnic, and, cultural, backgrounds, and, they, can, become, a, source, of, misinformation, and, delusion, for, example, in, a, school, when, students, are, confronted, with, the, task, of, writing, a, theme, they, think, in, terms, of, literary, associations, often, using, stereotypes, picked, up, from, books, films, and, magazines, that, they, have, read, or, viewed, the, danger, in, stereotyping, lies, not, in, its, existence, but, in, the, fact, that, it, can, become, a, substitute, for, observation, and, a, misinterpretation, of, a, cultural, identity, promoting, information, literacy, is, a, pedagogical, approach, that, can, effectively, combat, the, entrenchment, of, stereotypes, the, necessity, for, using, information, literacy, to, separate, multicultural, fact, from, fiction, is, well, illustrated, with, examples, from, literature, and, media, stereotypes, are, common, in, various, cultural, media, where, they, take, the, form, of, dramatic, stock, characters, the, instantly, recognizable, nature, of, stereotypes, mean, that, they, are, effective, in, advertising, and, situation, comedy, alexander, fedorov, 2015, proposed, a, concept, of, media, stereotypes, analysis, this, concept, refers, to, identification, and, analysis, of, stereotypical, images, of, people, ideas, events, stories, themes, etc, in, media, context, the, characters, that, do, appear, in, movies, greatly, affect, how, people, worldwide, perceive, gender, relations, race, and, cultural, communities, because, approximately, 85, of, worldwide, ticket, sales, are, directed, toward, hollywood, movies, the, american, movie, industry, has, been, greatly, responsible, for, portraying, characters, of, different, cultures, and, diversity, to, fit, into, stereotypical, categories, this, has, led, to, the, spread, and, persistence, of, gender, racial, ethnic, and, cultural, stereotypes, seen, in, the, movies, for, example, russians, are, usually, portrayed, as, ruthless, agents, brutal, mobsters, and, villains, in, hollywood, movies, according, to, russian, american, professor, nina, l, khrushcheva, you, can, t, even, turn, the, tv, on, and, go, to, the, movies, without, reference, to, russians, as, horrible, the, portrayals, of, latin, americans, in, film, and, print, media, are, restricted, to, a, narrow, set, of, characters, latin, americans, are, largely, depicted, as, sexualized, figures, such, as, the, latino, macho, or, the, latina, vixen, gang, members, illegal, immigrants, or, entertainers, by, comparison, they, are, rarely, portrayed, as, working, professionals, business, leaders, or, politicians, in, hollywood, films, there, are, several, latin, american, stereotypes, that, have, historically, been, used, some, examples, are, el, bandido, the, halfbreed, harlot, the, male, buffoon, the, female, clown, the, latin, lover, the, dark, lady, the, wise, old, man, and, the, poor, peon, many, hispanic, characters, in, hollywood, films, consists, of, one, or, more, of, these, basic, stereotypes, but, it, has, been, rare, to, view, latin, american, actors, representing, characters, outside, of, this, stereotypical, criteria, media, stereotypes, of, women, first, emerged, in, the, early, 20th, century, various, stereotypic, depictions, or, types, of, women, appeared, in, magazines, including, victorian, ideals, of, femininity, the, new, woman, the, gibson, girl, the, femme, fatale, and, the, flapper, stereotypes, are, also, common, in, video, games, with, women, being, portrayed, as, stereotypes, such, as, the, damsel, in, distress, or, as, sexual, objects, see, gender, representation, in, video, games, studies, show, that, minorities, are, portrayed, most, often, in, stereotypical, roles, such, as, athletes, and, gangsters, see, race, and, video, games, in, literature, and, art, stereotypes, are, clich, d, or, predictable, characters, or, situations, throughout, history, storytellers, have, drawn, from, stereotypical, characters, and, situations, to, immediately, connect, the, audience, with, new, tales, female, athletes, encounter, various, pressures, and, stereotypes, which, have, significant, psychological, consequences, these, stereotypes, give, rise, to, challenges, in, athletes, lives, including, diminished, self, esteem, leading, to, more, profound, psychological, impacts, female, athletes, have, made, considerable, strides, in, overcoming, obstacles, they, have, transitioned, from, being, unable, to, compete, competitively, due, to, biological, misconceptions, to, having, equal, opportunities, as, male, athletes, thanks, to, title, ix, today, there, is, greater, societal, acceptance, of, female, athletes, however, the, intersection, of, being, a, female, athlete, adds, additional, pressures, not, only, are, they, expected, to, excel, in, competition, but, they, are, also, required, to, conform, to, societal, expectations, of, femininity, furthermore, female, athletes, often, face, scrutiny, and, criticism, regarding, their, appearance, compared, to, non, athletic, women, young, athletes, in, particular, confront, an, intensified, amount, of, pressure, leading, some, to, quit, sports, because, it, is, no, longer, enjoyable, and, the, implications, of, being, a, young, female, athlete, become, overwhelming, they, are, unfairly, labeled, as, gay, or, delicate, and, subjected, to, derogatory, comments, such, as, like, a, girl, additionally, they, grapple, with, body, image, concerns, that, can, give, rise, to, severe, health, issues, even, specific, sports, contribute, to, the, scrutiny, female, athletes, face, with, criticism, directed, at, the, uniforms, required, for, competition, the, proliferation, of, stereotypes, in, women, s, sports, has, resulted, in, a, decline, in, female, participation, these, social, stigmas, including, being, labeled, as, gay, or, delicate, and, the, expectation, to, play, in, a, manner, deemed, like, a, girl, have, contributed, to, body, image, issues, eating, disorders, and, depression, among, numerous, female, athletes
