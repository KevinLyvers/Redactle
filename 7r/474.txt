igbo, english, i, b, o, ee, boh, us, also, b, o, ig, boh, standard, igbo, s, s, gb, is, the, principal, native, language, cluster, of, the, igbo, people, an, ethnicity, in, the, southeastern, part, of, nigeria, igbo, languages, are, spoken, by, a, total, of, 31, million, people, the, number, of, igboid, languages, depends, on, how, one, classifies, a, language, versus, a, dialect, so, there, could, be, around, 35, different, igbo, languages, the, core, igbo, cluster, or, igbo, proper, is, generally, thought, to, be, one, language, but, there, is, limited, mutual, intelligibility, between, the, different, groupings, north, west, south, and, east, a, standard, literary, language, termed, igbo, izugbe, meaning, general, igbo, was, generically, developed, and, later, adopted, around, 1972, with, its, core, foundation, based, on, the, orlu, isu, dialects, anambra, awka, dialects, and, umuahia, ohuhu, dialects, omitting, the, nasalization, and, aspiration, of, those, varieties, the, first, book, to, publish, igbo, terms, was, history, of, the, mission, of, the, evangelical, brothers, in, the, caribbean, german, geschichte, der, mission, der, evangelischen, br, der, auf, den, carabischen, inseln, published, in, 1777, shortly, afterwards, in, 1789, the, interesting, narrative, of, the, life, of, olaudah, equiano, was, published, in, london, england, written, by, olaudah, equiano, who, was, a, former, slave, featuring, 79, igbo, words, the, narrative, also, illustrated, various, aspects, of, igbo, life, in, detail, based, on, equiano, s, experiences, in, his, hometown, of, essaka, following, the, british, niger, expeditions, of, 1854, and, 1857, samuel, ajayi, crowther, published, an, igbo, primer, coded, by, a, young, igbo, missionary, named, simon, jonas, who, travelled, with, him, to, aboh, in, 1857, the, language, was, standardized, in, church, usage, by, the, union, igbo, bible, 1913, central, igbo, is, based, on, the, dialects, of, two, members, of, the, ezinifite, group, of, igbo, in, central, owerri, province, between, the, towns, of, owerri, and, umuahia, in, eastern, nigeria, from, its, proposal, as, a, literary, form, in, 1939, by, ida, c, ward, it, was, gradually, accepted, by, missionaries, writers, and, publishers, across, the, region, standard, igbo, aims, to, cross, pollinate, central, igbo, with, words, from, other, igbo, dialects, with, the, adoption, of, loan, words, chinua, achebe, passionately, denounced, language, standardization, efforts, beginning, with, union, igbo, through, to, central, and, finally, standard, igbo, in, a, 1999, lecture, sponsored, by, the, roman, catholic, archdiocese, in, owerri, igbo, and, its, dialects, is, the, dominant, language, in, the, following, nigerian, states, lexical, categories, in, igbo, include, nouns, pronouns, numerals, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and, a, single, preposition, the, meaning, of, na, the, single, preposition, is, flexible, and, must, be, ascertained, from, the, context, examples, from, emenanjo, 2015, illustrate, the, range, of, meaning, o, 3sg, b, live, n, enugw, prep, enugw, o, b, n, enugw, 3sg, live, prep, enugw, he, lives, in, enugw, o, 3sg, b, live, ebe, here, this, n, og, prep, time, agha, war, o, b, ebe, n, og, agha, 3sg, live, here, this, prep, time, war, he, lived, here, during, the, time, of, the, war, nd, people, f,

believe, in, the, trinity, igbo, has, an, extremely, limited, number, of, adjectives, in, a, closed, class, emenanjo, 1978, 2015, counts, just, eight, which, occur, in, pairs, of, opposites, ukwu, big, nta, small, oji, dark, cha, light, h, r, new, ochie, old, ma, good, nj, bad, adjectival, meaning, is, otherwise, conveyed, through, the, use, of, stative, verbs, or, abstract, nouns, verbs, by, far, the, most, prominent, category, in, igbo, host, most, of, the, language, s, morphology, and, appear, to, be, the, most, basic, category, many, processes, can, derive, new, words, from, verbs, but, few, can, derive, verbs, from, words, of, other, classes, igbo, pronouns, do, not, index, gender, and, the, same, pronouns, are, used, for, male, female, and, inanimate, beings, so, the, sentence, maka, can, mean, he, she, or, it, is, beautiful, igbo, is, a, tonal, language, tone, varies, by, dialect, but, in, most, dialects, there, seem, to, be, three, register, tones, and, three, contour, tones, the, language, s, tone, system, was, given, by, john, goldsmith, as, an, example, of, autosegmental, phenomena, that, go, beyond, the, linear, model, of, phonology, laid, out, in, the, sound, pattern, of, english, igbo, words, may, differ, only, in, tone, an, example, is, kw, cry, kw, bed, kw, egg, and, kw, cloth, as, tone, is, not, normally, written, these, all, appear, as, akwa, in, print, in, many, cases, the, two, or, sometimes, three, tones, commonly, used, in, igbo, dictionaries, fail, to, represent, how, words, actually, sound, in, the, spoken, language, this, indicates, that, igbo, may, have, many, more, tones, than, previously, recognised, for, example, the, imperative, form, of, the, word, bia, come, has, a, different, tone, to, that, used, in, statement, o, bia, he, came, that, imperative, tone, is, also, used, in, the, second, syllable, of, abuo, two, another, distinct, tone, appears, in, the, second, syllable, of, asaa, seven, and, another, in, the, second, syllable, of, aguu, hunger, the, language, features, vowel, harmony, with, two, sets, of, oral, vowels, distinguished, by, pharyngeal, cavity, size, described, in, terms, of, retracted, tongue, root, rtr, these, vowels, also, occupy, different, places, in, vowel, space, the, last, commonly, transcribed, in, keeping, with, neighboring, languages, for, simplicity, phonemic, transcriptions, typically, choose, only, one, of, these, parameters, to, be, distinctive, either, rtr, as, in, the, chart, on, the, right, and, igbo, orthography, that, is, as, i, i, e, a, u, u, o, o, or, vowel, space, as, in, the, alphabetic, chart, below, that, is, as, i, e, a, u, o, there, are, also, nasal, vowels, adjacent, vowels, usually, undergo, assimilation, during, speech, the, sound, of, a, preceding, vowel, usually, at, the, end, of, one, word, merges, in, a, rapid, transition, to, the, sound, of, the, following, vowel, particularly, at, the, start, of, another, word, giving, the, second, vowel, greater, prominence, in, speech, usually, the, first, vowel, in, the, first, word, is, only, slightly, identifiable, to, listeners, usually, undergoing, centralisation, k, m, sj, for, example, becomes, k, m, sj, goodbye, an, exception, to, this, assimilation, may, be, with, words, ending, in, a, such, as, n, in, n, l, on, the, ground, which, could, be, completely, assimilated, leaving, n, in, rapid, speech, as, in, n, l, or, n, l, in, other, dialects, however, the, instance, of, a, such, as, in, n, in, n, r, r, he, she, it, is, eating, results, in, a, long, vowel, n, r, r, the, igbo, language, is, tonal, in, nature, this, means, that, the, meaning, of, a, word, can, be, altered, depending, on, the, tone, used, when, pronouncing, it, igbo, has, two, main, tones, high, and, low, the, high, tone, is, usually, marked, with, an, acute, accent, and, the, low, tone, is, marked, with, a, grave, accent, for, example, the, word, akwa, can, mean, cry, egg, cloth, sew, depending, on, the, tone, used, if, pronounced, with, a, high, tone, on, the, first, and, last, syllable, it, means, cry, but, if, pronounced, with, a, low, tone, on, the, first, syllable, and, high, on, the, last, syllable, it, means, egg, if, it, is, pronounced, with, low, tone, on, both, syllables, then, it, will, mean, cloth, or, sew, another, example, is, the, word, eze, which, means, king, or, teeth, if, pronounced, with, a, high, tone, it, means, king, but, if, pronounced, with, a, low, tone, it, means, teeth, the, use, of, tonal, inflection, in, igbo, language, is, very, important, because, it, helps, to, differentiate, between, words, that, would, otherwise, sound, the, same, it, can, be, challenging, for, english, speakers, to, learn, how, to, use, the, tones, properly, but, with, practice, it, can, be, mastered, igbo, does, not, have, a, contrast, among, voiced, occlusives, between, voiced, stops, and, nasals, stops, precede, oral, vowels, and, nasals, precede, nasal, vowels, only, a, limited, number, of, other, consonants, occur, before, nasal, vowels, including, f, z, s, in, some, dialects, such, as, enu, onitsha, igbo, the, doubly, articulated, b, and, k, p, are, realized, as, a, voiced, devoiced, labial, velar, implosive, the, approximant, is, realized, as, an, alveolar, tap, between, vowels, as, in, r, the, enu, onitsha, igbo, dialect, is, very, much, similar, to, enuani, spoken, among, the, igbo, anioma, people, in, delta, state, to, illustrate, the, effect, of, phonological, analysis, the, following, inventory, of, a, typical, central, dialect, is, taken, from, clark, 1990, nasality, has, been, analyzed, as, a, feature, of, consonants, rather, than, vowels, avoiding, the, problem, of, why, so, few, consonants, occur, before, nasal, vowels, has, also, been, analyzed, as, c, v, syllables, are, of, the, form, c, v, optional, consonant, vowel, or, n, a, syllabic, nasal, cv, is, the, most, common, syllable, type, every, syllable, bears, a, tone, consonant, clusters, do, not, occur, the, semivowels, j, and, w, can, occur, between, consonant, and, vowel, in, some, syllables, the, semi, vowel, in, cjv, is, analyzed, as, an, underlying, vowel, so, that, b, a, is, the, phonemic, form, of, bj, come, on, the, other, hand, w, in, cwv, is, analyzed, as, an, instance, of, labialization, so, the, phonemic, form, of, the, verb, gw, tell, is, igbo, is, an, isolating, language, that, exhibits, very, little, fusion, the, language, is, predominantly, suffixing, in, a, hierarchical, manner, such, that, the, ordering, of, suffixes, is, governed, semantically, rather, than, by, fixed, position, classes, the, language, has, very, little, inflectional, morphology, but, much, derivational, and, extensional, morphology, most, derivation, takes, place, with, verbal, roots, extensional, suffixes, a, term, used, in, the, igbo, literature, refer, to, morphology, that, has, some, but, not, all, characteristics, of, derivation, the, words, created, by, these, suffixes, always, belong, to, the, same, lexical, category, as, the, root, from, which, they, are, created, and, the, suffixes, effects, are, principally, semantic, on, these, grounds, emenanjo, 2015, asserts, that, the, suffixes, called, extensional, are, bound, lexical, compounding, elements, they, cannot, occur, independently, though, many, are, related, to, other, free, morphemes, from, which, they, may, have, originally, been, derived, in, addition, to, affixation, igbo, exhibits, both, partial, and, full, reduplication, to, form, gerunds, from, verbs, the, partial, form, copies, on, the, initial, consonant, and, inserts, a, high, front, vowel, while, the, full, form, copies, the, first, consonant, and, vowel, both, types, are, then, prefixed, with, o, for, example, go, buy, partially, reduplicates, to, form, gigo, buying, and, bu, carry, fully, reduplicates, to, form, bubu, carrying, some, other, noun, and, verb, forms, also, exhibit, reduplication, but, because, the, reduplicated, forms, are, semantically, unpredictable, reduplication, in, their, case, is, not, synchronically, productive, and, they, are, better, described, as, separate, lexical, items, igbo, does, not, mark, overt, case, distinctions, on, nominal, constituents, and, conveys, grammatical, relations, only, through, word, order, the, typical, igbo, sentence, displays, subject, verb, object, svo, ordering, where, the, subject, is, understood, as, the, sole, argument, of, an, intransitive, verb, or, the, agent, like, external, argument, of, a, transitive, verb, igbo, thus, exhibits, accusative, alignment, it, has, been, proposed, with, reservations, that, some, igbo, verbs, display, ergativity, on, some, level, as, in, the, following, two, examples, nnukwu, big, mm, ri, water, n, ez, aux, fall, n, iro, prep, outside, nnukwu, mm, ri, n, ez, n, iro, big, water, aux, fall, prep, outside, heavy, rain, is, falling, outside, it, n, ez, aux, fall, nnukwu, big, mm, ri, water, n, iro, prep, outside, n, ez, nnukwu, mm, ri, n, iro, it, aux, fall, big, water, prep, outside, heavy, rain, is, falling, outside, in, 4, the, verb, has, a, single, argument, nnukwu, mm, ri, which, appears, in, subject, position, and, in, the, transitive, sentence, 5, that, same, argument, appears, in, the, object, position, even, though, the, two, are, semantically, identical, on, this, basis, authors, such, as, emenanjuo, 2015, have, posited, that, this, argument, is, an, absolutive, and, that, igbo, therefore, contains, some, degree, of, ergativity, however, others, disagree, arguing, that, the, relevant, category, is, not, alignment, but, underlying, argument, structure, under, this, hypothesis, 4, and, 5, differ, only, in, the, application, of, a, transformation, and, can, be, accounted, for, entirely, by, the, unaccusative, hypothesis, and, the, extended, projection, principle, the, nominal, argument, is, generated, in, object, position, and, either, it, is, raised, to, the, subject, position, as, in, 4, or, the, subject, position, is, filled, with, a, pleonastic, pronoun, as, in, 5, igbo, relative, clauses, are, externally, headed, and, follow, the, head, noun, they, do, not, employ, overt, relative, markers, or, resumptive, pronouns, instead, leaving, a, gap, in, the, position, of, the, relativized, noun, subjects, and, objects, can, be, relativized, examples, include, relative, clauses, bracketed, 3sg, z, t, r, buy, suff, prf, kwa, egg, goodness, z, t, r, kwa, 3sg, buy, suff, prf, egg, she, bought, eggs, that, are, good, kwa, egg, buy, suff, prf, m, r, good, prf, mm, goodness, kwa, m, r, mm, egg, good, prf, goodness, the, eggs, that, she, bought, are, good, igbo, lacks, the, common, valence, decreasing, operation, of, passivization, a, fact, which, has, led, multiple, scholars, to, claim, that, voice, is, not, a, relevant, category, in, igbo, the, language, does, however, possess, some, valence, increasing, operations, that, could, be, construed, as, voice, under, a, broader, definition, g, ogu, a, v, la, pref, be, open, suff, prf, g, a, v, la, ogu, pref, be, open, suff, prf, ogu, has, become, disgraced,

applicative, construction, which, takes, the, suffix, rv, where, v, copies, the, previous, vowel, and, the, applicative, argument, follows, the, verb, directly, the, applicative, suffix, is, identical, in, form, with, the, past, tense, suffix, with, which, it, should, not, be, confused, for, example, b, ibe, nye, re, give, prf, appl, m, 1sg, g, ogu, kw, kw, book, b, nye, re, m, g, kw, kw, ibe, give, prf, appl, 1sg, ogu, book, ibe, gave, the, book, to, ogu, for, me, igbo, permits, verb, serialization, which, is, used, extensively, to, compensate, for, its, paucity, of, prepositions, among, the, meaning, types, commonly, expressed, in, serial, verb, constructions, are, instruments, datives, accompaniment, purpose, and, manner, 13, and, 14, below, illustrate, instrumental, and, dative, verb, series, respectively, 3sg, n, ji, aux, pref, use, mm, knife, bacha, pref, peel, j, yam, n, ji, mm, bacha, j, 3sg, aux, pref, use, knife, pref, peel, yam, he, peels, yams, with, a, knife,

nsibidi, ideograms, which, spread, to, their, neighbors, such, as, ekoi, people, and, ejegham, people, for, basic, written, communication, nsibidi, is, an, ancient, system, of, graphic, communication, indigenous, to, peoples, in, southeastern, nigeria, and, southwestern, cameroon, in, the, cross, river, region, it, is, also, used, by, neighboring, ekoi, ejegham, efik, and, ibibio, peoples, they, have, been, used, since, at, least, the, 16th, century, under, the, aro, confederacy, but, died, out, publicly, after, they, became, popular, amongst, secret, societies, such, as, the, ekpe, who, used, them, as, a, secret, form, of, communication, nsibidi, however, is, not, a, full, writing, system, because, it, cannot, transcribe, the, igbo, language, specifically, in, 1960, a, rural, land, owner, and, dibia, named, nwagu, aneke, developed, a, syllabary, for, the, umuleri, dialect, of, igbo, the, script, named, after, him, as, the, nwagu, aneke, script, was, used, to, write, hundreds, of, diary, entries, until, aneke, s, death, in, 1991, the, nwagu, aneke, project, is, working, on, translating, nwagu, s, commentary, and, diary, before, the, existence, of, any, official, system, of, orthography, for, the, igbo, language, travelers, and, writers, documented, igbo, sounds, by, utilizing, the, orthracyologies, of, their, own, languages, in, transcribing, them, though, they, encountered, difficulty, representing, particular, sounds, such, as, implosives, labialized, velars, syllabic, nasals, and, non, expanded, vowels, in, the, 1850s, german, philologist, karl, richard, lepsius, published, the, standard, alphabet, which, was, universal, to, all, languages, of, the, world, and, became, the, first, igbo, orthography, it, contained, 34, letters, and, included, digraphs, and, diacritical, marks, to, transcribe, sounds, distinct, to, african, languages, the, lepsius, standard, alphabet, contained, the, following, letters, the, lepsius, orthography, was, replaced, by, the, practical, orthography, of, african, languages, africa, orthography, in, 1929, by, the, colonial, government, in, nigeria, the, new, orthography, created, by, the, international, institute, of, african, languages, and, cultures, iialc, had, 36, letters, and, disposed, of, diacritic, marks, numerous, controversial, issues, with, the, new, orthography, eventually, led, to, its, replacement, in, the, early, 1960s, the, africa, orthography, contained, the, following, letters, the, current, nw, alphabet, a, compromise, between, the, older, lepsius, alphabet, and, a, newer, alphabet, advocated, by, the, international, institute, of, african, languages, and, cultures, iialc, is, presented, in, the, following, table, with, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, equivalents, for, the, characters, the, graphemes, gb, and, kp, are, described, both, as, coarticulated, b, and, k, p, and, as, implosives, so, both, values, are, included, in, the, table, m, and, n, each, represent, two, phonemes, a, nasal, consonant, and, a, syllabic, nasal, tones, are, sometimes, indicated, in, writing, and, sometimes, not, when, tone, is, indicated, low, tones, are, shown, with, a, grave, accent, over, the, vowel, for, example, a, and, high, tones, with, an, acute, accent, over, the, vowel, for, example, a, a, variety, of, issues, have, made, agreement, on, a, standardized, orthography, for, the, igbo, language, difficult, in, 1976, the, igbo, standardization, committee, criticized, the, official, orthography, in, light, of, the, difficulty, notating, diacritic, marks, using, typewriters, and, computers, difficulty, in, accurately, representing, tone, with, tone, marking, conventions, as, they, are, subject, to, change, in, different, environments, and, the, inability, to, capture, various, sounds, particular, to, certain, igbo, dialects, the, committee, produced, a, modified, version, of, the, nw, orthography, called, the, new, standard, orthography, which, substituted, and, for, and, c, for, ch, and, for, the, new, standard, orthography, has, not, been, widely, adopted, although, it, was, used, for, example, in, the, 1998, igbo, english, dictionary, by, michael, echeruo, more, recent, calls, for, reform, have, been, based, in, part, on, the, rogue, use, of, alphabetic, symbols, tonal, notations, and, spelling, conventions, that, deviate, from, the, standard, orthography, there, are, also, some, modern, movements, to, restore, the, use, of, and, modernize, nsibidi, as, a, writing, system, which, mostly, focus, on, igbo, as, it, is, the, most, populous, language, that, used, to, use, nsibidi, in, 2009, a, nigerian, software, engineer, and, artist, named, lotanna, igwe, odunze, developed, a, native, script, named, ndebe, script, it, was, further, redesigned, and, relaunched, in, 2020, as, a, standalone, writing, system, completely, independent, of, nsibidi, the, script, gained, notable, attention, after, a, write, up, from, nigerian, linguist, kola, tubosun, on, its, straightforward, and, logical, approach, to, indicating, tonal, and, dialectal, variety, compared, to, latin, proverbs, and, idiomatic, expressions, ilu, and, akpalaokwu, in, igbo, respectively, are, highly, valued, by, the, igbo, people, and, proficiency, in, the, language, means, knowing, how, to, intersperse, speech, with, a, good, dose, of, proverbs, chinua, achebe, in, things, fall, apart, describes, proverbs, as, the, palm, oil, with, which, words, are, eaten, proverbs, are, widely, used, in, the, traditional, society, to, describe, in, very, few, words, what, could, have, otherwise, required, a, thousand, words, proverbs, may, also, become, euphemistic, means, of, making, certain, expressions, in, the, igbo, society, thus, the, igbo, have, come, to, typically, rely, on, this, as, avenues, of, certain, expressions, as, a, consequence, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, igbo, language, was, spread, by, enslaved, igbo, people, throughout, slave, colonies, in, the, americas, examples, can, be, found, in, jamaican, patois, the, pronoun, unu, used, for, you, plural, is, taken, from, igbo, red, eboe, refers, to, a,

words, of, african, origin, for, more, examples, the, word, bim, a, name, for, barbados, was, commonly, used, by, enslaved, barbadians, bajans, this, word, is, said, to, derive, from, the, igbo, language, derived, from, bi, mu, or, either, bem, ndi, bem, nwanyi, ibem, or, nwoke, ibem, english, my, people, but, it, may, have, other, origins, see, barbados, etymology, in, cuba, the, igbo, language, along, with, the, efik, language, continues, to, be, used, albeit, in, a, creolized, form, in, ceremonies, of, the, abaku, society, equivalent, or, derived, from, the, ekpe, society, in, modern, nigeria, in, modern, times, igbo, people, in, the, diaspora, are, putting, resources, in, place, to, make, the, study, of, the, language, accessible, there, are, some, discussions, as, to, whether, the, igbo, language, is, in, danger, of, extinction, advanced, in, part, by, a, 2006, unesco, report, that, predicted, the, igbo, language, will, become, extinct, within, 50, years, professor, of, african, and, african, diaspora, literatures, at, university, of, massachusetts, chukwuma, azuonye, emphasizes, indicators, for, the, endangerment, of, the, igbo, language, based, on, criteria, that, includes, the, declining, population, of, monolingual, elderly, speakers, reduced, competence, and, performance, among, igbo, speakers, especially, children, the, deterioration, of,
