curiosity, from, latin, c, ri, sit, s, from, c, ri, sus, careful, diligent, curious, akin, to, cura, care, is, a, quality, related, to, inquisitive, thinking, such, as, exploration, investigation, and, learning, evident, in, humans, and, other, animals, curiosity, helps, human, development, from, which, derives, the, process, of, learning, and, desire, to, acquire, knowledge, and, skill, the, term, curiosity, can, also, denote, the, behavior, characteristic, or, emotion, of, being, curious, in, regard, to, the, desire, to, gain, knowledge, or, information, curiosity, as, a, behavior, and, emotion, is, the, driving, force, behind, human, development, such, as, progress, in, science, language, and, industry, curiosity, can, be, considered, to, be, an, evolutionary, adaptation, based, on, an, organism, s, ability, to, learn, certain, curious, animals, namely, corvids, octopuses, dolphins, elephants, rats, etc, will, pursue, information, in, order, to, adapt, to, their, surrounding, and, learn, how, things, work, this, behavior, is, termed, neophilia, the, love, of, new, things, for, animals, a, fear, of, the, unknown, or, the, new, neophobia, is, much, more, common, especially, later, in, life, many, species, display, curiosity, including, apes, cats, and, rodents, it, is, common, to, human, beings, at, all, ages, from, infancy, through, adulthood, research, has, shown, that, curiosity, is, not, a, fixed, attribute, amongst, humans, but, rather, can, be, nurtured, and, developed, early, definitions, of, curiosity, call, it, a, motivated, desire, for, information, this, motivational, desire, has, been, said, to, stem, from, a, passion, or, an, appetite, for, knowledge, information, and, understanding, traditional, ideas, of, curiosity, have, expanded, to, consider, the, difference, between, perceptual, curiosity, as, the, innate, exploratory, behavior, that, is, present, in, all, animals, and, epistemic, curiosity, as, the, desire, for, knowledge, that, is, specifically, attributed, to, humans, daniel, berlyne, recognized, three, classes, of, variables, playing, a, role, in, evoking, curiosity, psychophysical, variables, ecological, variables, and, collative, variables, psychophysical, variables, correspond, to, physical, intensity, ecological, variables, to, motivational, significance, and, task, relevance, collative, variables, involve, a, comparison, between, different, stimuli, or, features, which, may, be, actually, perceived, or, which, may, be, recalled, from, memory, berlyne, mentioned, four, collative, variables, novelty, complexity, uncertainty, and, conflict, though, he, suggested, that, all, collative, variables, probably, involve, conflict, additionally, he, considered, three, variables, supplementary, to, novelty, change, surprisingness, and, incongruity, finally, curiosity, may, not, only, be, aroused, by, the, perception, of, some, stimulus, associated, with, the, aforementioned, variables, specific, exploration, but, also, by, a, lack, of, stimulation, out, of, boredom, diversive, exploration, curiosity, driven, behavior, is, often, defined, as, behavior, through, which, knowledge, is, gained, a, form, of, exploratory, behavior, it, therefore, encompasses, all, behaviors, that, provide, access, to, or, increase, sensory, information, berlyne, divided, curiosity, driven, behavior, into, three, categories, orienting, responses, locomotor, exploration, and, investigatory, responses, or, investigatory, manipulation, previously, berlyne, suggested, that, curiosity, also, includes, verbal, activities, such, as, asking, questions, and, symbolic, activities, consisting, of, internally, fueled, mental, processes, such, as, thinking, epistemic, exploration, like, other, desires, and, need, states, that, take, on, an, appetitive, quality, e, g, food, hunger, curiosity, is, linked, with, exploratory, behavior, and, experiences, of, reward, curiosity, can, be, described, in, terms, of, positive, emotions, and, acquiring, knowledge, when, one, s, curiosity, has, been, aroused, it, is, considered, inherently, rewarding, and, pleasurable, discovering, new, information, may, also, be, rewarding, because, it, can, help, reduce, undesirable, states, of, uncertainty, rather, than, stimulating, interest, theories, have, arisen, in, attempts, to, further, understand, this, need, to, rectify, states, of, uncertainty, and, the, desire, to, participate, in, pleasurable, experiences, of, exploratory, behaviors, curiosity, drive, theory, posits, undesirable, experiences, of, uncertainty, and, ambiguity, the, reduction, of, these, unpleasant, feelings, is, rewarding, this, theory, suggests, that, people, desire, coherence, and, understanding, in, their, thought, processes, when, this, coherence, is, disrupted, by, something, that, is, unfamiliar, uncertain, or, ambiguous, an, individual, s, curiosity, drive, causes, them, to, collect, information, and, knowledge, of, the, unfamiliar, to, restore, coherent, thought, processes, this, theory, suggests, that, curiosity, is, developed, out, of, the, desire, to, make, sense, of, unfamiliar, aspects, of, one, s, environment, through, exploratory, behaviors, once, understanding, of, the, unfamiliar, has, been, achieved, and, coherence, has, been, restored, these, behaviors, and, desires, subside, derivations, of, curiosity, drive, theory, differ, on, whether, curiosity, is, a, primary, or, secondary, drive, and, if, this, curiosity, drive, originates, due, to, one, s, need, to, make, sense, of, and, regulate, one, s, environment, or, if, it, is, caused, by, an, external, stimulus, causes, can, range, from, basic, needs, that, need, to, be, satisfied, e, g, hunger, thirst, to, needs, in, fear, induced, situations, each, of, these, derived, theories, state, that, whether, the, need, is, primary, or, secondary, curiosity, develops, from, experiences, that, create, a, sensation, of, uncertainty, or, perceived, unpleasantness, curiosity, then, acts, to, dispel, this, uncertainty, by, exhibiting, curious, and, exploratory, behavior, one, is, able, to, gain, knowledge, of, the, unfamiliar, and, thus, reduce, the, state, of, uncertainty, or, unpleasantness, this, theory, however, does, not, address, the, idea, that, curiosity, can, often, be, displayed, even, in, the, absence, of, new, or, unfamiliar, situations, this, type, of, exploratory, behavior, too, is, common, in, many, species, a, human, toddler, if, bored, in, his, current, situation, devoid, of, arousing, stimuli, will, walk, about, until, he, finds, something, interesting, the, observation, of, curiosity, even, in, the, absence, of, novel, stimuli, pinpoints, one, of, the, major, shortcomings, in, the, curiosity, drive, model, optimal, arousal, theory, developed, out, of, the, need, to, explain, this, desire, to, seek, out, opportunities, to, engage, in, exploratory, behaviors, without, the, presence, of, uncertain, or, ambiguous, situations, optimal, arousal, suggests, that, one, can, be, motivated, to, maintain, a, pleasurable, sense, of, arousal, through, such, exploratory, behaviors, when, a, stimulus, is, encountered, that, is, associated, with, complexity, uncertainty, conflict, or, novelty, this, increases, arousal, above, the, optimal, point, and, exploratory, behavior, is, employed, to, learn, about, that, stimulus, and, thereby, reduce, arousal, again, in, contrast, if, the, environment, is, boring, and, lacks, excitement, arousal, is, reduced, below, the, optimal, point, and, exploratory, behavior, is, employed, to, increase, information, input, and, stimulation, and, thereby, increasing, arousal, again, this, theory, addresses, both, curiosity, elicited, by, uncertain, or, unfamiliar, situations, and, curiosity, elicited, in, the, absence, of, such, situations, cognitive, consistency, theories, assume, that, when, two, or, more, simultaneously, active, cognitive, structures, are, logically, inconsistent, arousal, is, increased, which, activates, processes, with, the, expected, consequence, of, increasing, consistency, and, decreasing, arousal, similar, to, optimal, arousal, theory, cognitive, consistency, theory, suggests, that, there, is, a, tendency, to, maintain, arousal, at, a, preferred, or, expected, level, but, it, also, explicitly, links, the, amount, of, arousal, to, the, amount, of, experienced, inconsistency, between, an, expected, situation, and, the, actually, perceived, situation, when, this, inconsistency, is, small, exploratory, behavior, triggered, by, curiosity, is, employed, to, gather, information, with, which, expectancy, can, be, updated, through, learning, to, match, perception, thereby, reducing, inconsistency, this, approach, associates, curiosity, with, aggression, and, fear, if, the, inconsistency, is, larger, fear, or, aggressive, behavior, may, be, employed, to, alter, the, perception, in, order, to, make, it, match, expectancy, depending, on, the, size, of, the, inconsistency, as, well, as, the, specific, context, aggressive, behavior, alters, perception, by, forcefully, manipulating, it, into, matching, the, expected, situation, while, fear, prompts, flight, which, removes, the, inconsistent, stimulus, from, the, perceptual, field, and, thus, resolves, the, inconsistency, taking, into, account, the, shortcomings, of, both, curiosity, drive, and, optimal, arousal, theories, attempts, have, been, made, to, integrate, neurobiological, aspects, of, reward, wanting, and, pleasure, into, a, more, comprehensive, theory, for, curiosity, research, suggests, that, desiring, new, information, involves, mesolimbic, pathways, of, the, brain, that, account, for, dopamine, activation, the, use, of, these, pathways, and, dopamine, activation, may, be, how, the, brain, assigns, value, to, new, information, and, interprets, this, as, reward, this, theory, from, neurobiology, can, supplement, curiosity, drive, theory, by, explaining, the, motivation, of, exploratory, behavior, although, curiosity, is, widely, regarded, its, root, causes, are, largely, empirically, unknown, however, some, studies, have, provided, insight, into, the, neurological, mechanisms, that, make, up, what, is, known, as, the, reward, pathway, which, may, influence, characteristics, associated, with, curiosity, such, as, learning, memory, and, motivation, due, to, the, complex, nature, of, curiosity, research, that, focuses, on, specific, neural, processes, with, these, characteristics, can, help, us, understand, of, the, phenomenon, of, curiosity, as, a, whole, the, following, are, descriptions, of, characteristics, of, curiosity, and, their, links, to, neurological, aspects, that, are, essential, in, creating, exploratory, behaviors, the, drive, to, learn, new, information, or, perform, some, action, may, be, prompted, by, the, anticipation, of, reward, so, what, we, learn, about, motivation, and, reward, may, help, us, to, understand, curiosity, reward, is, defined, as, the, positive, reinforcement, of, an, action, reinforcement, that, encourages, a, particular, behavior, by, means, of, the, emotional, sensations, of, relief, pleasure, and, satisfaction, that, correlate, with, happiness, many, areas, in, the, brain, process, reward, and, come, together, to, form, what, is, called, the, reward, pathway, in, this, pathway, many, neurotransmitters, play, a, role, in, the, activation, of, the, reward, sensation, including, dopamine, serotonin, and, opioids, dopamine, is, linked, to, curiosity, as, it, assigns, and, retains, reward, values, of, information, gained, research, suggests, higher, amounts, of, dopamine, are, released, when, the, reward, is, unknown, and, the, stimulus, is, unfamiliar, compared, to, activation, of, dopamine, when, stimulus, is, familiar, the, nucleus, accumbens, is, a, formation, of, neurons, that, is, important, in, reward, pathway, activation, such, as, the, release, of, dopamine, in, investigating, response, to, novel, or, exciting, stimuli, the, fast, dopamine, release, observed, during, childhood, and, adolescence, is, important, in, development, as, curiosity, and, exploratory, behavior, are, the, largest, facilitators, of, learning, during, early, years, the, sensation, pleasure, of, liking, can, occur, when, opioids, are, released, by, the, nucleus, accumbens, this, helps, someone, evaluate, the, unfamiliar, situation, or, environment, and, attach, value, to, the, novel, object, these, processes, of, both, wanting, and, liking, play, a, role, in, activating, the, reward, system, of, the, brain, and, perhaps, in, the, stimulation, of, curious, or, information, seeking, tendencies, as, well, the, caudate, nucleus, is, a, region, of, the, brain, that, is, highly, responsive, to, dopamine, and, is, another, component, of, the, reward, pathway, research, suggests, that, the, caudate, nucleus, anticipates, the, possibility, of, and, reward, of, exploratory, behavior, and, gathered, information, thus, contributing, to, factors, of, curiosity, regions, of, the, anterior, insula, and, anterior, cingulate, cortex, correspond, to, both, conflict, and, arousal, and, as, such, seem, to, reinforce, certain, exploratory, models, of, curiosity, cortisol, is, a, chemical, known, for, its, role, in, stress, regulation, however, cortisol, may, also, be, associated, with, curious, or, exploratory, behavior, studies, suggesting, a, role, of, cortisol, in, curiosity, support, optimal, arousal, theory, they, suggest, the, release, of, some, cortisol, causing, some, stress, encourages, curious, behavior, while, too, much, stress, can, initiate, a, back, away, response, attention, is, important, to, curiosity, because, it, allows, one, to, selectively, focus, and, concentrate, on, particular, stimuli, in, the, surrounding, environment, as, there, are, limited, cognitive, and, sensory, resources, to, understand, and, evaluate, stimuli, attention, allows, the, brain, to, better, focus, on, what, it, perceives, to, be, the, most, important, or, relevant, of, these, stimuli, individuals, tend, to, focus, on, stimuli, that, are, particularly, stimulating, or, engaging, the, more, attention, a, stimulus, garners, the, more, frequent, one, s, energy, and, focus, will, be, directed, towards, that, stimulus, this, suggests, an, individual, will, focus, on, new, or, unfamiliar, stimuli, in, an, effort, to, better, understand, or, make, sense, of, the, unknown, rather, than, on, more, familiar, or, repetitive, stimuli, the, striatum, is, a, part, of, the, brain, that, coordinates, motivation, with, body, movement, the, striatum, likely, plays, a, role, in, attention, and, reward, anticipation, both, of, which, are, important, in, provoking, curiosity, the, precuneus, is, a, region, of, the, brain, that, is, involved, in, attention, episodic, memory, and, visuospatial, processing, there, is, a, correlation, between, the, amount, of, grey, matter, in, the, precuneus, and, levels, of, curious, and, exploratory, behaviors, this, suggests, that, precuneus, density, has, an, influence, on, levels, of, curiosity, memory, plays, an, important, role, in, curiosity, memory, is, how, the, brain, stores, and, accesses, stored, information, if, curiosity, is, the, desire, to, seek, out, and, understand, unfamiliar, or, novel, stimuli, memory, helps, determine, if, the, stimulus, is, indeed, unfamiliar, in, order, to, determine, if, a, stimulus, is, novel, an, individual, must, remember, if, the, stimulus, has, been, encountered, before, curiosity, may, also, affect, memory, stimuli, that, are, novel, tend, to, capture, more, of, our, attention, additionally, novel, stimuli, usually, have, a, reward, value, associated, with, them, the, anticipated, reward, of, what, learning, that, new, information, may, bring, with, stronger, associations, and, more, attention, devoted, to, a, stimulus, it, is, probable, that, the, memory, formed, from, that, stimulus, will, be, longer, lasting, and, easier, to, recall, both, of, which, facilitate, better, learning, the, hippocampus, is, important, in, memory, formation, and, recall, and, therefore, in, determining, the, novelty, of, various, stimuli, research, suggests, the, hippocampus, is, involved, in, generating, the, motivation, to, explore, for, the, purpose, of, learning, the, parahippocampal, gyrus, phg, an, area, of, grey, matter, surrounding, the, hippocampus, has, been, implicated, in, the, amplification, of, curiosity, the, amygdala, is, associated, with, emotional, processing, particularly, for, the, emotion, of, fear, as, well, as, memory, it, is, important, in, processing, emotional, reactions, towards, novel, or, unexpected, stimuli, and, the, induction, of, exploratory, behavior, this, suggests, a, connection, between, curiosity, levels, and, the, amygdala, however, more, research, is, needed, on, direct, correlation, jean, piaget, argued, that, babies, and, children, constantly, try, to, make, sense, of, their, reality, and, that, this, contributes, to, their, intellectual, development, according, to, piaget, children, develop, hypotheses, conduct, experiments, and, then, reassess, their, hypotheses, depending, on, what, they, observe, piaget, was, the, first, to, closely, document, children, s, actions, and, interpret, them, as, consistent, calculated, efforts, to, test, and, learn, about, their, environment, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, for, curiosity, in, children, most, research, on, curiosity, focused, on, adults, and, used, self, report, measures, that, are, inappropriate, and, inapplicable, for, studying, children, exploratory, behaviour, is, commonly, observed, in, children, and, is, associated, with, their, curiosity, development, several, studies, of, children, s, curiosity, simply, observe, their, interaction, with, novel, and, familiar, toys, evidence, suggests, a, relationship, between, the, anxiety, children, might, feel, and, their, curiosity, one, study, found, that, object, curiosity, in, 11, year, olds, was, negatively, related, to, psychological, maladjusted, so, children, who, exhibit, more, anxiety, in, classroom, settings, engage, in, less, curious, behaviour, certain, aspects, of, classroom, learning, may, depend, on, curiosity, which, can, be, affected, by, students, anxiety, an, aptitude, for, curiosity, in, adolescents, may, produce, higher, academic, performance, one, study, revealed, that, of, 568, high, school, students, those, who, exhibited, an, aptitude, for, curiosity, in, conjunction, with, motivation, and, creativity, showed, a, 33, 1, variation, in, math, scores, and, 15, 5, variation, in, science, scores, when, tested, on, a, standardized, academic, exam, other, measures, of, childhood, curiosity, used, exploratory, behaviour, as, a, basis, but, differed, on, which, parts, of, this, behaviour, to, focus, on, some, studies, examined, children, s, preference, for, complexity, the, unknown, as, a, basis, for, their, curiosity, measure, others, relied, on, novelty, preference, as, their, basis, researchers, also, examined, the, relationship, between, a, child, s, reaction, to, surprise, and, their, curiosity, children, may, be, further, motivated, to, learn, when, dealing, with, uncertainty, their, reactions, to, not, having, their, expectations, met, may, fuel, their, curiosity, more, than, the, introduction, of, a, novel, or, complex, object, would, curiosity, has, been, of, interest, to, philosophers, curiosity, has, been, recognised, as, an, important, intellectual, or, epistemic, virtue, due, to, the, role, that, it, plays, in, motivating, people, to, acquire, knowledge, and, understanding, it, has, also, been, considered, an, important, moral, virtue, as, curiosity, can, help, humans, find, meaning, in, their, lives, and, to, cultivate, a, sense, of, care, about, others, and, things, in, the, world, when, curiosity, in, young, people, leads, to, knowledge, gathering, it, is, widely, seen, as, a, positive, due, to, the, importance, of, curiosity, people, debate, about, whether, contemporary, societies, effectively, cultivate, the, right, type, of, curiosity, some, believe, that, children, s, curiosity, is, discouraged, throughout, the, process, of, formal, education, children, are, born, scientists, from, the, first, ball, they, send, flying, to, the, ant, they, watch, carry, a, crumb, children, use, science, s, tools, enthusiasm, hypotheses, tests, conclusions, to, uncover, the, world, s, mysteries, but, somehow, students, seem, to, lose, what, once, came, naturally, neurodegenerative, diseases, and, psychological, disorders, can, affect, various, characteristics, of, curiosity, for, example, alzheimer, s, disease, s, effects, on, memory, or, depression, affect, motivation, and, reward, alzheimer, s, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, that, degrades, memory, depression, is, a, mood, disorder, that, is, characterized, by, a, lack, of, interest, in, one, s, environment, and, feelings, of, sadness, or, hopelessness, a, lack, of, curiosity, for, novel, stimuli, might, be, a, predictor, for, these, and, other, illnesses, social, curiosity, is, defined, as, a, drive, to, understand, one, s, environment, as, it, relates, to, sociality, with, others, such, curiosity, plays, a, role, in, one, s, ability, to, successfully, navigate, social, interactions, by, perceiving, and, processing, one, s, own, behavior, and, the, behavior, of, others, it, also, plays, a, role, in, helping, one, adapt, to, varying, social, situations, morbid, curiosity, is, focused, on, death, violence, or, any, other, event, that, may, cause, harm, physically, or, emotionally, it, typically, is, described, as, having, an, addictive, quality, associated, with, a, need, to, understand, or, make, sense, of, topics, that, surround, harm, violence, or, death, this, can, be, attributed, to, one, s, need, to, relate, unusual, and, often, difficult, circumstances, to, a, primary, emotion, or, experience, of, one, s, own, described, as, meta, emotions, one, explanation, evolutionary, biologists, offer, for, curiosity, about, death, is, that, by, learning, about, life, threatening, situations, death, can, be, avoided, another, suggestion, some, psychologists, posit, is, that, as, spectators, of, gruesome, events, humans, are, seeking, to, empathize, with, the, victim, alternatively, people, may, be, trying, to, understand, how, another, person, can, become, the, perpetrator, of, harm, according, to, science, journalist, erika, engelhaupt, morbid, curiosity, is, not, a, desire, to, be, sad, instead, it, has, the, ability, to, set, our, minds, at, ease, be, reassuring, us, that, even, death, follows, the, rules, of, the, natural, world, interest, in, human, curiosity, about, difficult, circumstances, dates, back, to, aristotle, in, his, poetics, in, which, he, noted, we, enjoy, and, admire, paintings, of, objects, that, in, themselves, would, annoy, or, disgust, us, in, a, 2017, paper, suzanne, oosterwijk, a, psychologist, from, the, netherlands, concluded, that, people, choose, to, see, graphic, images, even, when, presented, the, option, to, avoid, them, and, look, at, them, for, a, longer, period, of, time, than, neutral, or, positive, images, curiosity, can, be, a, temporary, state, of, being, or, a, stable, trait, in, an, individual, state, curiosity, is, external, wondering, why, things, happen, just, for, the, sake, of, curiousness, for, example, wondering, why, most, stores, open, at, 8, a, m, trait, curiosity, describes, people, who, are, interested, in, learning, for, example, by, trying, out, a, new, sport, or, food, or, traveling, to, an, unfamiliar, place, one, can, look, at, curiosity, as, the, urge, that, draws, people, out, of, their, comfort, zones, and, fears, as, the, agents, that, keep, them, within, those, zones, ai, agents, can, exhibit, curiosity, through, intrinsic, motivation, this, can, improve, the, success, of, an, ai, agent, at, various, tasks, in, artificial, intelligence, curiosity, is, typically, defined, quantitatively, as, the, uncertainty, the, agent, has, in, predicting, its, own, actions, given, its, current, state, in, 2019, a, study, trained, ai, agents, to, play, video, games, but, they, were, rewarded, only, for, curiosity, the, agents, reliably, learned, advantageous, game, behaviors, based, solely, on, the, curiosity, reward
