conservatism, is, a, cultural, social, and, political, philosophy, and, ideology, that, seeks, to, promote, and, preserve, traditional, institutions, customs, and, values, the, central, tenets, of, conservatism, may, vary, in, relation, to, the, culture, and, civilisation, in, which, it, appears, in, western, culture, depending, on, the, particular, nation, conservatives, seek, to, promote, and, preserve, a, range, of, institutions, such, as, the, nuclear, family, organised, religion, the, military, the, nation, state, property, rights, rule, of, law, aristocracy, and, monarchy, conservatives, tend, to, favour, institutions, and, practices, that, enhance, social, order, and, historical, continuity, edmund, burke, an, 18th, century, anglo, irish, statesman, who, opposed, the, french, revolution, but, supported, the, american, revolution, is, credited, as, one, of, the, forefathers, of, conservative, thought, in, the, 1790s, along, with, savoyard, statesman, joseph, de, maistre, the, first, established, use, of, the, term, in, a, political, context, originated, in, 1818, with, fran, ois, ren, de, chateaubriand, during, the, period, of, bourbon, restoration, that, sought, to, roll, back, the, policies, of, the, french, revolution, and, establish, social, order, conservatism, has, varied, considerably, as, it, has, adapted, itself, to, existing, traditions, and, national, cultures, thus, conservatives, from, different, parts, of, the, world, each, upholding, their, respective, traditions, may, disagree, on, a, wide, range, of, issues, one, of, the, three, major, ideologies, along, with, liberalism, and, socialism, conservatism, is, the, dominant, ideology, in, many, nations, across, the, world, including, hungary, india, iran, israel, japan, poland, russia, singapore, and, south, korea, historically, associated, with, right, wing, politics, the, term, has, been, used, to, describe, a, wide, range, of, views, conservatism, may, be, either, libertarian, or, authoritarian, populist, or, elitist, progressive, or, reactionary, moderate, or, extreme, scholars, have, tried, to, define, conservatism, as, a, set, of, beliefs, or, principles, andrew, heywood, argues, that, the, five, central, beliefs, of, conservatism, are, tradition, human, imperfection, organic, society, authority, hierarchy, and, property, russell, kirk, developed, five, canons, of, conservatism, in, the, conservative, mind, 1953, some, political, scientists, such, as, samuel, p, huntington, have, seen, conservatism, as, situational, under, this, definition, conservatives, are, seen, as, defending, the, established, institutions, of, their, time, according, to, quintin, hogg, the, chairman, of, the, british, conservative, party, in, 1959, conservatism, is, not, so, much, a, philosophy, as, an, attitude, a, constant, force, performing, a, timeless, function, in, the, development, of, a, free, society, and, corresponding, to, a, deep, and, permanent, requirement, of, human, nature, itself, conservatism, is, often, used, as, a, generic, term, to, describe, a, right, wing, viewpoint, occupying, the, political, spectrum, between, liberalism, and, fascism, conservatism, has, been, called, a, philosophy, of, human, imperfection, by, no, l, o, sullivan, reflecting, among, its, adherents, a, negative, view, of, human, nature, and, pessimism, of, the, potential, to, improve, it, through, utopian, schemes, thomas, hobbes, the, intellectual, godfather, of, the, realist, right, argued, that, the, state, of, nature, for, humans, was, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, requiring, centralised, authority, with, royal, sovereignty, to, guarantee, law, and, order, edmund, burke, often, called, the, father, of, modern, conservatism, believed, that, human, beings, are, steeped, in, original, sin, and, that, society, therefore, needs, traditional, institutions, such, as, an, established, church, and, a, landed, aristocracy, in, order, to, function, despite, the, lack, of, a, universal, definition, certain, themes, can, be, recognised, as, common, across, conservative, thought, according, to, michael, oakeshott, to, be, conservative, is, to, prefer, the, familiar, to, the, unknown, to, prefer, the, tried, to, the, untried, fact, to, mystery, the, actual, to, the, possible, the, limited, to, the, unbounded, the, near, to, the, distant, the, sufficient, to, the, superabundant, the, convenient, to, the, perfect, present, laughter, to, utopian, bliss, such, traditionalism, may, be, a, reflection, of, trust, in, time, tested, methods, of, social, organisation, giving, votes, to, the, dead, traditions, may, also, be, steeped, in, a, sense, of, identity, in, contrast, to, the, tradition, based, definition, of, conservatism, some, left, wing, political, theorists, like, corey, robin, define, conservatism, primarily, in, terms, of, a, general, defence, of, social, and, economic, inequality, from, this, perspective, conservatism, is, less, an, attempt, to, uphold, old, institutions, and, more, a, meditation, on, and, theoretical, rendition, of, the, felt, experience, of, having, power, seeing, it, threatened, and, trying, to, win, it, back, on, another, occasion, robin, argues, for, a, more, complex, relation, conservatism, is, a, defense, of, established, hierarchies, but, it, is, also, fearful, of, those, established, hierarchies, it, sees, in, their, assuredness, of, power, the, source, of, corruption, decadence, and, decline, ruling, regimes, require, some, kind, of, irritant, a, grain, of, sand, in, the, oyster, to, reactivate, their, latent, powers, to, exercise, their, atrophied, muscles, to, make, their, pearls, in, conservatism, a, rediscovery, 2022, political, philosopher, yoram, hazony, argues, that, in, a, traditional, conservative, community, members, have, importance, and, influence, to, the, degree, they, are, honoured, within, the, social, hierarchy, which, includes, factors, such, as, age, experience, and, wisdom, conservatives, often, glorify, hierarchies, as, demonstrated, in, an, aphorism, by, conservative, philosopher, nicol, s, g, mez, d, vila, hierarchies, are, celestial, in, hell, all, are, equal, the, word, hierarchy, has, religious, roots, and, translates, to, rule, of, a, high, priest, authority, is, a, core, tenet, of, conservatism, more, specifically, conservatives, tend, to, believe, in, traditional, authority, according, to, max, weber, this, form, of, authority, is, resting, on, an, established, belief, in, the, sanctity, of, immemorial, traditions, and, the, legitimacy, of, those, exercising, authority, under, them, alexandre, koj, ve, distinguishes, between, two, different, forms, of, traditional, authority, robert, nisbet, acknowledges, that, the, decline, of, traditional, authority, in, the, modern, world, is, partly, linked, with, the, retreat, of, old, institutions, such, as, guild, order, parish, and, family, institutions, that, formerly, acted, as, intermediaries, between, the, state, and, the, individual, hannah, arendt, argues, that, the, modern, world, suffers, an, existential, crisis, with, a, dramatic, breakdown, of, all, traditional, authorities, which, are, needed, for, the, continuity, of, an, established, civilisation, edmund, burke, has, been, widely, regarded, as, the, philosophical, founder, of, modern, conservatism, he, served, as, the, private, secretary, to, the, marquis, of, rockingham, and, as, official, pamphleteer, to, the, rockingham, branch, of, the, whig, party, together, with, the, tories, they, were, the, conservatives, in, the, late, 18th, century, united, kingdom, burke, s, views, were, a, mixture, of, conservatism, and, republicanism, he, supported, the, american, revolution, of, 1775, 1783, but, abhorred, the, violence, of, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, 1799, he, accepted, the, conservative, ideals, of, private, property, and, the, economics, of, adam, smith, but, he, thought, that, capitalism, should, remain, subordinate, to, the, conservative, social, ethic, and, that, the, business, class, should, be, subordinate, to, aristocracy, he, insisted, on, standards, of, honour, derived, from, the, medieval, aristocratic, tradition, and, saw, the, aristocracy, as, the, nation, s, natural, leaders, that, meant, limits, on, the, powers, of, the, crown, since, he, found, the, institutions, of, parliament, to, be, better, informed, than, commissions, appointed, by, the, executive, he, favoured, an, established, church, but, allowed, for, a, degree, of, religious, toleration, burke, ultimately, justified, the, social, order, on, the, basis, of, tradition, tradition, represented, the, wisdom, of, the, species, and, he, valued, community, and, social, harmony, over, social, reforms, another, form, of, conservatism, developed, in, france, in, parallel, to, conservatism, in, britain, it, was, influenced, by, counter, enlightenment, works, by, philosophers, such, as, joseph, de, maistre, and, louis, de, bonald, many, continental, conservatives, do, not, support, separation, of, church, and, state, with, most, supporting, state, cooperation, with, the, catholic, church, such, as, had, existed, in, france, before, the, revolution, conservatives, were, also, early, to, embrace, nationalism, which, was, previously, associated, with, liberalism, and, the, revolution, in, france, another, early, french, conservative, fran, ois, ren, de, chateaubriand, espoused, a, romantic, opposition, to, modernity, contrasting, its, emptiness, with, the, full, heart, of, traditional, faith, and, loyalty, elsewhere, on, the, continent, german, thinkers, justus, m, ser, and, friedrich, von, gentz, criticised, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, that, came, of, the, revolution, opposition, was, also, expressed, by, german, idealists, such, as, adam, m, ller, and, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, the, latter, inspiring, both, leftist, and, rightist, followers, both, burke, and, maistre, were, critical, of, democracy, in, general, though, their, reasons, differed, maistre, was, pessimistic, about, humans, being, able, to, follow, rules, while, burke, was, sceptical, about, humans, innate, ability, to, make, rules, for, maistre, rules, had, a, divine, origin, while, burke, believed, they, arose, from, custom, the, lack, of, custom, for, burke, and, the, lack, of, divine, guidance, for, maistre, meant, that, people, would, act, in, terrible, ways, both, also, believed, that, liberty, of, the, wrong, kind, led, to, bewilderment, and, political, breakdown, their, ideas, would, together, flow, into, a, stream, of, anti, rationalist, romantic, conservatism, but, would, still, stay, separate, whereas, burke, was, more, open, to, argumentation, and, disagreement, maistre, wanted, faith, and, authority, leading, to, a, more, illiberal, strain, of, thought, authoritarian, conservatism, refers, to, autocratic, regimes, that, portray, authority, as, absolute, and, unquestionable, authoritarian, conservative, movements, show, strong, devotion, towards, religion, tradition, and, culture, while, also, expressing, fervent, nationalism, akin, to, other, far, right, nationalist, movements, examples, of, authoritarian, conservative, dictators, include, marshal, philippe, p, tain, in, france, regent, mikl, s, horthy, in, hungary, general, ioannis, metaxas, in, greece, king, alexander, i, in, yugoslavia, prime, minister, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, in, portugal, chancellor, engelbert, dollfuss, in, austria, generalissimo, francisco, franco, in, spain, king, carol, ii, in, romania, and, tsar, boris, iii, in, bulgaria, authoritarian, conservative, movements, were, prominent, in, the, same, era, as, fascism, with, which, it, sometimes, clashed, although, both, ideologies, shared, core, values, such, as, nationalism, and, had, common, enemies, such, as, communism, there, was, nonetheless, a, contrast, between, the, traditionalist, and, elitist, nature, of, authoritarian, conservatism, and, the, revolutionary, and, populist, nature, of, fascism, thus, it, was, common, for, authoritarian, conservative, regimes, to, suppress, rising, fascist, and, nazi, movements, the, hostility, between, the, two, ideologies, is, highlighted, by, the, struggle, for, power, in, austria, which, was, marked, by, the, assassination, of, the, ultra, catholic, dictator, engelbert, dollfuss, by, austrian, nazis, likewise, croatian, fascists, assassinated, king, alexander, i, of, yugoslavia, in, romania, as, the, fascist, iron, guard, was, gaining, popularity, and, nazi, germany, was, making, advances, on, the, european, political, stage, king, carol, ii, ordered, the, execution, of, corneliu, zelea, codreanu, and, other, top, ranking, romanian, fascists, the, exiled, german, emperor, wilhelm, ii, was, an, enemy, of, adolf, hitler, and, stated, that, nazism, made, him, ashamed, to, be, a, german, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, the, catholic, seminarian, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, who, was, portugal, s, dictator, for, 40, years, denounced, fascism, and, nazism, as, a, pagan, caesarism, that, did, not, recognise, legal, religious, or, moral, limits, political, scientist, seymour, martin, lipset, has, examined, the, class, basis, of, right, wing, extremist, politics, in, the, 1920, 1960, era, he, reports, conservative, or, rightist, extremist, movements, have, arisen, at, different, periods, in, modern, history, ranging, from, the, horthyites, in, hungary, the, christian, social, party, of, dollfuss, in, austria, der, stahlhelm, and, other, nationalists, in, pre, hitler, germany, and, salazar, in, portugal, to, the, pre, 1966, gaullist, movements, and, the, monarchists, in, contemporary, france, and, italy, the, right, extremists, are, conservative, not, revolutionary, they, seek, to, change, political, institutions, in, order, to, preserve, or, restore, cultural, and, economic, ones, while, extremists, of, the, centre, and, left, seek, to, use, political, means, for, cultural, and, social, revolution, the, ideal, of, the, right, extremist, is, not, a, totalitarian, ruler, but, a, monarch, or, a, traditionalist, who, acts, like, one, many, such, movements, in, spain, austria, hungary, germany, and, italy, have, been, explicitly, monarchist, the, supporters, of, these, movements, differ, from, those, of, the, centrists, tending, to, be, wealthier, and, more, religious, which, is, more, important, in, terms, of, a, potential, for, mass, support, edmund, fawcett, states, that, fascism, is, totalitarian, populist, and, anti, pluralist, whereas, authoritarian, conservatism, is, somewhat, pluralist, but, most, of, all, elitist, and, anti, populist, he, concludes, the, fascist, is, a, nonconservative, who, takes, anti, liberalism, to, extremes, the, right, wing, authoritarian, is, a, conservative, who, takes, fear, of, democracy, to, extremes, during, the, cold, war, right, wing, military, dictatorships, were, prominent, in, latin, america, with, most, nations, being, under, military, rule, by, the, middle, of, the, 1970s, one, example, of, this, was, general, augusto, pinochet, who, ruled, over, chile, from, 1973, to, 1990, according, to, erik, von, kuehnelt, leddihn, military, dictatorships, arise, in, democratic, systems, in, order, to, stop, leftist, parties, from, becoming, totalitarian, the, most, recent, instance, occurred, in, bolivia, in, 2024, when, general, juan, jos, z, iga, staged, a, coup, in, order, to, overthrow, the, far, left, president, luis, arce, in, the, 21st, century, the, authoritarian, style, of, government, experienced, a, worldwide, renaissance, with, conservative, statesmen, such, as, president, vladimir, putin, in, russia, president, recep, tayyip, erdo, an, in, turkey, prime, minister, viktor, orb, n, in, hungary, prime, minister, narendra, modi, in, india, and, president, donald, trump, in, the, united, states, liberal, conservatism, is, a, variant, of, conservatism, that, is, strongly, influenced, by, liberal, stances, it, incorporates, the, classical, liberal, view, of, minimal, economic, interventionism, meaning, that, individuals, should, be, free, to, participate, in, the, market, and, generate, wealth, without, government, interference, however, individuals, cannot, be, thoroughly, depended, on, to, act, responsibly, in, other, spheres, of, life, therefore, liberal, conservatives, believe, that, a, strong, state, is, necessary, to, ensure, law, and, order, and, social, institutions, are, needed, to, nurture, a, sense, of, duty, and, responsibility, to, the, nation, originally, opposed, to, capitalism, and, the, industrial, revolution, the, conservative, ideology, in, many, countries, adopted, economic, liberalism, especially, in, the, united, states, where, this, ideology, is, known, as, fiscal, conservatism, national, conservatism, prioritises, the, defence, of, national, and, cultural, identity, often, based, on, a, theory, of, the, family, as, a, model, for, the, state, national, conservatism, is, orientated, towards, upholding, national, sovereignty, which, includes, limited, immigration, and, a, strong, national, defence, in, europe, national, conservatives, are, usually, eurosceptics, yoram, hazony, has, argued, for, national, conservatism, in, his, work, the, virtue, of, nationalism, 2018, paternalistic, conservatism, is, a, strand, in, conservatism, which, reflects, the, belief, that, societies, exist, and, develop, organically, and, that, members, within, them, have, obligations, towards, each, other, there, is, particular, emphasis, on, the, paternalistic, obligation, noblesse, oblige, of, those, who, are, privileged, and, wealthy, to, the, poorer, parts, of, society, which, is, consistent, with, principles, such, as, duty, organicism, and, hierarchy, its, proponents, often, stress, the, importance, of, a, social, safety, net, to, deal, with, poverty, supporting, limited, redistribution, of, wealth, along, with, government, regulation, of, markets, in, the, interests, of, both, consumers, and, producers, paternalistic, conservatism, first, arose, as, a, distinct, ideology, in, the, united,

of, social, programs, known, as, state, socialism, which, included, insurance, for, workers, against, sickness, accident, incapacity, and, old, age, the, goal, of, this, conservative, state, building, strategy, was, to, make, ordinary, germans, not, just, the, junker, aristocracy, more, loyal, to, state, and, emperor, chancellor, leo, von, caprivi, promoted, a, conservative, agenda, called, the, new, course, in, the, united, states, president, theodore, roosevelt, has, been, identified, as, the, main, exponent, of, progressive, conservatism, roosevelt, stated, that, he, had, always, believed, that, wise, progressivism, and, wise, conservatism, go, hand, in, hand, the, republican, administration, of, president, william, howard, taft, was, progressive, conservative, and, he, described,

return, to, the, status, quo, ante, and, tend, to, view, the, modern, world, in, a, negative, light, especially, concerning, mass, culture, and, secularism, although, different, groups, of, reactionaries, may, choose, different, traditional, values, to, revive, some, political, scientists, such, as, corey, robin, treat, the, words, reactionary, and, conservative, as, synonyms, others,

commitment, to, democracy, especially, under, benjamin, disraeli, the, effect, was, to, significantly, strengthen, conservatism, as, a, grassroots, political, force, conservatism, no, longer, was, the, philosophical, defence, of, the, landed, aristocracy, but, had, been, refreshed, into, redefining, its, commitment, to, the, ideals, of, order, both, secular, and, religious, expanding, imperialism, strengthened, monarchy, and, a, more, generous, vision, of, the, welfare, state, as, opposed, to, the, punitive, vision, of, the, whigs, and, liberals, as, early, as, 1835, disraeli, attacked, the, whigs, and, utilitarians, as, slavishly, devoted, to, an, industrial, oligarchy, while, he, described, his, fellow, tories, as, the, only, really, democratic, party, of, england, devoted, to, the, interests, of, the, whole, people, nevertheless, inside, the, party, there, was, a, tension, between, the, growing, numbers, of, wealthy, businessmen, on, the, one, side, and, the, aristocracy, and, rural, gentry, on, the, other, the, aristocracy, gained, strength, as, businessmen, discovered, they, could, use, their, wealth, to, buy, a, peerage, and, a, country, estate, some, conservatives, lamented, the, passing, of, a, pastoral, world, where, the, ethos, of, noblesse, oblige, had, promoted, respect, from, the, lower, classes, they, saw, the, anglican, church, and, the, aristocracy, as, balances, against, commercial, wealth, they, worked, toward, legislation, for, improved, working, conditions, and, urban, housing, this, viewpoint, would, later, be, called, tory, democracy, however, since, burke, there, has, always, been, tension, between, traditional, aristocratic, conservatism, and, the, wealthy, liberal, business, class, in, 1834, tory, prime, minister, robert, peel, issued, the, tamworth, manifesto, in, which, he, pledged, to, endorse, moderate, political, reform, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, transformation, from, high, tory, reactionism, towards, a, more, modern, form, of, conservatism, as, a, result, the, party, became, known, as, the, conservative, party, a, name, it, has, retained, to, this, day, however, peel, would, also, be, the, root, of, a, split, in, the, party, between, the, traditional, tories, by, the, earl, of, derby, and, benjamin, disraeli, and, the, peelites, led, first, by, peel, himself, then, by, the, earl, of, aberdeen, the, split, occurred, in, 1846, over, the, issue, of, free, trade, which, peel, supported, versus, protectionism, supported, by, derby, the, majority, of, the, party, sided, with, derby, whilst, about, a, third, split, away, eventually, merging, with, the, whigs, and, the, radicals, to, form, the, liberal, party, despite, the, split, the, mainstream, conservative, party, accepted, the, doctrine, of, free, trade, in, 1852, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, liberal, party, faced, political, schisms, especially, over, irish, home, rule, leader, william, gladstone, himself, a, former, peelite, sought, to, give, ireland, a, degree, of, autonomy, a, move, that, elements, in, both, the, left, and, right, wings, of, his, party, opposed, these, split, off, to, become, the, liberal, unionists, led, by, joseph, chamberlain, forming, a, coalition, with, the, conservatives, before, merging, with, them, in, 1912, the, liberal, unionist, influence, dragged, the, conservative, party, towards, the, left, as, conservative, governments, passed, a, number, of, progressive, reforms, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, traditional, business, supporters, of, the, liberal, party, had, joined, the, conservatives, making, them, the, party, of, business, and, commerce, as, well, after, a, period, of, liberal, dominance, before, world, war, i, the, conservatives, gradually, became, more, influential, in, government, regaining, full, control, of, the, cabinet, in, 1922, in, the, inter, war, period, conservatism, was, the, major, ideology, in, britain, as, the, liberal, party, vied, with, the, labour, party, for, control, of, the, left, after, world, war, ii, the, first, labour, government, 1945, 1951, under, clement, attlee, embarked, on, a, program, of, nationalisation, of, industry, and, the, promotion, of, social, welfare, the, conservatives, generally, accepted, those, policies, until, the, 1980s, in, the, 1980s, the, conservative, government, of, margaret, thatcher, guided, by, neoliberal, economics, reversed, many, of, labour, s, social, programmes, privatised, large, parts, of, the, uk, economy, and, sold, state, owned, assets, the, conservative, party, also, adopted, soft, eurosceptic, politics, and, opposed, federal, europe, other, conservative, political, parties, such, as, the, democratic, unionist, party, dup, founded, in, 1971, and, the, united, kingdom, independence, party, ukip, founded, in, 1993, began, to, appear, although, they, have, yet, to, make, any, significant, impact, at, westminster, as, of, 2014, the, dup, is, the, largest, political, party, in, the, ruling, coalition, in, the, northern, ireland, assembly, and, from, 2017, to, 2019, the, dup, provided,

employees, immune, from, civil, prosecution, where, conservative, parties, were, weak, or, non, existent, conservatives, were, more, likely, to, rely, on, military, dictatorship, as, a, preferred, form, of, government, however, in, some, nations, where, the, elites, were, able, to, mobilise, popular, support, for, conservative, parties, longer, periods, of, political, stability, were, achieved, chile, colombia, and, venezuela, are, examples, of, nations, that, developed, strong, conservative, parties, argentina, brazil, el, salvador, and, peru, are, examples, of, nations, where, this, did, not, occur, louis, hartz, explained, conservatism, in, latin, american, nations, as, a, result, of, their, settlement, as, feudal, societies, defunct, conservatism, in, brazil, originates, from, the,

in, political, federalism, and, monarchism, brazil, is, the, only, latin, american, nation, with, a, relatively, strong, royalist, sentiment, and, throughout, modern, history, a, significant, minority, of, the, population, has, always, supported, a, monarchical, restoration, the, military, dictatorship, in, brazil, was, established, on, april, 1, 1964, after, a, coup, d, tat, by, the, brazilian, army, with, support, from, the, united, states, government, and, it, lasted, for, 21, years, until, march, 15, 1985, the, coup, received, support, from, almost, all, high, ranking, members, of, the, military, along, with, conservative, sectors, in, society, such, as, the, catholic, church, and, anti, communist, civilian, movements, among, the, brazilian, middle, and, upper, classes, the, dictatorship, reached, the, height, of, its, popularity, in, the, 1970s, with, the, so, called, brazilian, miracle, brazil, s, military, government, provided, a, model, for, other, military, regimes, throughout, latin, america, being, systematised, by, the, national, security, doctrine, which, was, used, to, justify, the, military, s, actions, as, operating, in, the, interest, of, national, security, in, a, time, of, crisis, in, contemporary, politics, a, conservative, wave, began, roughly, around, the, 2014, brazilian, presidential, election, according, to, commentators, the, national, congress, of, brazil, elected, in, 2014, may, be, considered, the, most, conservative, since, the, re, democratisation, movement, citing, an, increase, in, the, number, of, parliamentarians, linked, to, more, conservative, segments, such, as, ruralists, the, military, the, police, and, religious, conservatives, the, subsequent, economic, crisis, of, 2015, and, investigations, of, corruption,

19th, centuries, although, canada, also, developed, an, american, style, conservatism, that, competed, with, the, older, tory, conservatism, according, to, louis, hartz, french, canada, is, a, fragment, of, feudal, europe, whereas, the, united, states, and, english, canada, are, liberal, fragments, reginald, bibby, asserts, that, conservatism, has, been, strong, and, enduring, throughout,

that, conservatism, had, been, brought, to, the, united, states, and, he, interpreted, the, american, revolution, as, a, conservative, revolution, against, royal, innovation, the, revolution, was, also, supported, by, anglo, irish, statesman, edmund, burke, widely, known, as, the, father, of, conservatism, although, burke, and, a, few, founding, fathers, most, notably, john, adams, were, highly, critical, of, the, french, revolution, american, conservatism, is, a, broad, system, of, political, beliefs, in, the, united, states, which, is, characterized, by, respect, for, american,

conservative, stances, the, agorist, philosopher, samuel, edward, konkin, iii, labeled, this, ideology, right, libertarianism, while, frank, meyer, coined, the, term, fusionism, to, describe, this, ideological, hybrid, some, scholars, such, as, conservative, philosopher, russell, kirk, have, highlighted, the, contrasts, between, the, two, ideologies, stating, that, to, talk, of, forming, a,

those, of, left, wing, party, supporters, however, a, 2005, study, by, h, michael, crowson, and, colleagues, suggested, a, moderate, gap, between, rwa, and, other, conservative, positions, stating, that, their, results, indicated, that, conservatism, is, not, synonymous, with, rwa, according, to, political, scientist, karen, stenner, who, specialises, in, authoritarianism, conservatives, will, embrace, diversity, and, civil, liberties, to, the, extent, that, they, are, institutionalised, traditions, in, the, social, order, but, they, tend, to, be, drawn, to, authoritarianism, when, public,

found, evidence, to, support, the, claim, that, a, high, sdo, is, strongly, correlated, with, conservative, views, and, opposition, to, social, engineering, to, promote, equality, pratto, and, her, colleagues, also, found, that, high, sdo, scores, were, highly, correlated, with, measures, of, prejudice, however, david, j, schneider, argued, for, a, more, complex, relationships, between, the, three, factors, writing, that, correlations, between, prejudice, and, political, conservatism, are, reduced, virtually, to, zero, when, controls, for, sdo, are, instituted, suggesting, that, the,

also, found, that, the, correlation, between, racism, and, conservatism, could, be, accounted, for, by, their, mutual, relationship, with, sdo, in, his, book, gross, national, happiness, 2008, arthur, c, brooks, presents, the, finding, that, conservatives, are, roughly, twice, as, happy, as, social, liberals, a, 2008, study, suggested, that, conservatives, tend, to, be, happier, than, social,
