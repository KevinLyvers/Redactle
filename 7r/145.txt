transported, to, then, van, diemen, s, land, now, tasmania, between, 1823, and, 1853, about, 37, of, all, men, and, about, 15, of, all, women, arrived, with, tattoos, making, australia, at, the, time, the, most, heavily, tattooed, english, speaking, country, by, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, there, were, tattoo, studios, in, australia, but, they, do, not, appear, to, have, been, numerous, for, example, the, sydney, tattoo, studio, of, fred, harris, was, touted, as, being, the, only, tattoo, studio, in, sydney, between, 1916, and, 1943, tattoo, designs, often, reflected, the, culture, of, the, day, and, in, 1923, harris, s, small, parlour, experienced, an, increase, in, the, number, of, women, getting, tattoos, another, popular, trend, was, for, women, to, have, their, legs, tattooed, so, the, designs, could, be, seen, through, their, stockings, by, 1937, harris, was, one, of, sydney, s, best, known, tattoo, artists, and, was, inking, around, 2000, tattoos, a, year, in, his, shop, sailors, provided, most, of, the, canvases, for, his, work, but, among, the, more, popular, tattoos, in, 1938, were, australian, flags, and, kangaroos, for, sailors, of, the, visiting, american, fleet, in, modern, day, australia, a, popular, tattoo, design, is, the, southern, cross, motif, or, variations, of, it, there, are, currently, over, 2000, official, tattoo, practitioners, in, australia, and, over, 100, registered, parlours, and, clinics, with, the, number, of, unregistered, parlours, and, clinics, are, estimated, to, be, double, that, amount, the, demand, over, the, last, decade, for, tattoos, in, australia, has, risen, over, 440, making, it, an, in, demand, profession, in, the, country, there, are, several, large, tattoo, conventions, held, in, australia, some, of, which, are, considered, the, biggest, in, the, southern, hemisphere, with, the, best, artists, from, around, oceania, attending, of, the, three, best, known, pre, columbian, civilizations, in, the, americas, the, mayas, and, the, aztecs, of, central, america, were, known, to, wear, tattoos, while, the, incas, of, south, america, were, not, however, there, is, evidence, that, the, chimu, people, who, preceded, the, incas, did, wear, tattoos, for, magic, and, medical, purposes, the, diverse, tribes, of, the, amazon, have, also, worn, tattoos, for, millennia, and, continue, to, do, so, to, this, day, including, facial, tattoos, and, notably, the, people, of, the, xingu, river, in, the, north, of, brazil, and, the, putumayo, river, between, peru, brazil, and, colombia, s, o, paulo, brazil, is, largely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, tattooed, cities, in, the, world, the, m, ori, people, of, new, zealand, have, historically, practiced, tattooing, amongst, these, are, facial, designs, worn, to, indicate, lineage, social, position, and, status, within, the, tribe, called, t, moko, the, tattoo, art, was, a, sacred, marker, of, identity, among, the, m, ori, and, also, referred, to, as, a, vehicle, for, storing, one, s, tapu, or, spiritual, being, in, the, afterlife, one, practice, was, after, death, to, preserve, the, skin, covered, skull, known, as, toi, moko, or, mokomokai, in, the, period, of, early, contact, between, m, ori, and, europeans, these, heads, were, traded, especially, for, firearms, many, of, these, are, now, being, repatriated, back, to, new, zealand, led, by, the, national, museum, te, papa, tattooing, involves, the, placement, of, pigment, into, the, skin, s, dermis, the, layer, of, dermal, tissue, underlying, the, epidermis, after, initial, injection, pigment, is, dispersed, throughout, a, homogenized, damaged, layer, down, through, the, epidermis, and, upper, dermis, in, both, of, which, the, presence, of, foreign, material, activates, the, immune, system, s, phagocytes, to, engulf, the, pigment, particles, as, healing, proceeds, the, damaged, epidermis, flakes, away, eliminating, surface, pigment, while, deeper, in, the, skin, granulation, tissue, forms, which, is, later, converted, to, connective, tissue, by, collagen, growth, this, mends, the, upper, dermis, where, pigment, remains, trapped, within, successive, generations, of, macrophages, ultimately, concentrating, in, a, layer, just, below, the, dermis, epidermis, boundary, its, presence, there, is, stable, but, in, the, long, term, decades, the, pigment, tends, to, migrate, deeper, into, the, dermis, accounting, for, the, degraded, detail, of, old, tattoos, an, alternative, and, painless, method, of, permanent, tattooing, is, to, use, patches, covered, by, microneedles, made, of, tattoo, ink, the, patch, is, pressed, onto, the, skin, the, same, way, a, temporary, tattoo, paper, is, applied, to, the, body, the, microneedles, then, dissolve, and, after, a, few, minutes, the, ink, sinks, into, the, skin, some, tribal, cultures, traditionally, created, tattoos, by, cutting, designs, into, the, skin, and, rubbing, the, resulting, wound, with, ink, ashes, or, other, agents, some, cultures, continue, this, practice, which, may, be, an, adjunct, to, scarification, some, cultures, create, tattooed, marks, by, hand, tapping, the, ink, into, the, skin, using, sharpened, sticks, or, animal, bones, made, into, needles, with, clay, formed, disks, or, in, modern, times, actual, needles, the, most, common, method, of, tattooing, in, modern, times, is, the, electric, tattoo, machine, which, inserts, ink, into, the, skin, via, a, single, needle, or, a, group, of, needles, that, are, soldered, onto, a, bar, which, is, attached, to, an, oscillating, unit, the, unit, rapidly, and, repeatedly, drives, the, needles, in, and, out, of, the, skin, usually, 80, to, 150, times, a, second, the, needles, are, single, use, needles, that, come, packaged, individually, or, manufactured, by, artists, on, demand, as, groupings, dictate, on, a, per, piece, basis, in, modern, tattooing, an, artist, may, use, thermal, stencil, paper, or,

dayak, people, tattoos, were, records, of, how, many, heads, the, warriors, had, taken, in, battle, and, were, part, of, the, initiation, rites, into, adulthood, the, number, design, and, location, of, tattoos, therefore, were, indicative, of, a, warrior, s, status, and, prowess, they, were, also, regarded, as, magical, wards, against, various, dangers, like, evil, spirits, and, illnesses, among, the, visayans, of, the, pre, colonial, philippines, tattoos, were, worn, by, the, tumao, nobility, and, the, timawa, warrior, class, as, permanent, records, of, their, participation, and,

wu, taibo, and, his, brother, zhongyong, were, recorded, cutting, their, hair, and, tattooing, themselves, to, gain, acceptance, before, founding, the, state, of, wu, but, zhou, and, imperial, chinese, culture, tended, to, restrict, tattooing, as, a, punishment, for, marking, criminals, the, association, of, tattoos, with, criminals, was, transmitted, from, china, to, influence, japan,

covered, with, proper, clothing, the, regulations, were, added, to, osaka, s, ethical, codes, and, employees, with, tattoos, were, encouraged, to, have, them, removed, this, was, done, because, of, the, strong, connection, of, tattoos, with, the, yakuza, or, japanese, organized, crime, after, an, osaka, official, in, february, 2012, threatened, a, schoolchild, by, showing, his, tattoo, native,

the, russian, mafia, current, cultural, understandings, of, tattoos, in, europe, and, north, america, have, been, greatly, influenced, by, long, standing, stereotypes, based, on, deviant, social, groups, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, particularly, in, north, america, tattoos, have, been, associated, with, stereotypes, folklore, and, racism, not, until, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, did, people, associate, tattoos, with, such, societal, outcasts, as, bikers, and, prisoners, today, in, the, united, states, many, prisoners, and, criminal, gangs, use, distinctive, tattoos, to, indicate, facts, about, their, criminal, behavior, prison, sentences, and, organizational, affiliation, a, teardrop, tattoo, for, example, can, be, symbolic, of, murder, or, each, tear, represents, the, death,

absenteeism, and, truancy, adolescent, girls, showed, a, positive, correlation, between, body, modification, and, negative, feelings, towards, the, body, and, low, self, esteem, however, the, study, also, demonstrated, that, a, strong, motive, for, body, modification, is, the, search, for, self, and, attempts, to, attain, mastery, and, control, over, the, body, in, an, age, of, increasing, alienation, the, prevalence, of, women, in, the, tattoo, industry, in, the, 21st, century, along, with, larger, numbers, of, women, bearing, tattoos, appears, to, be, changing, negative, perceptions,
