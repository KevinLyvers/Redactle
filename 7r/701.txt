developmental, psychology, is, the, scientific, study, of, how, and, why, humans, grow, change, and, adapt, across, the, course, of, their, lives, originally, concerned, with, infants, and, children, the, field, has, expanded, to, include, adolescence, adult, development, aging, and, the, entire, lifespan, developmental, psychologists, aim, to, explain, how, thinking, feeling, and, behaviors, change, throughout, life, this, field, examines, change, across, three, major, dimensions, which, are, physical, development, cognitive, development, and, social, emotional, development, within, these, three, dimensions, are, a, broad, range, of, topics, including, motor, skills, executive, functions, moral, understanding, language, acquisition, social, change, personality, emotional, development, self, concept, and, identity, formation, developmental, psychology, examines, the, influences, of, nature, and, nurture, on, the, process, of, human, development, as, well, as, processes, of, change, in, context, across, time, many, researchers, are, interested, in, the, interactions, among, personal, characteristics, the, individual, s, behavior, and, environmental, factors, this, includes, the, social, context, and, the, built, environment, ongoing, debates, in, regards, to, developmental, psychology, include, biological, essentialism, vs, neuroplasticity, and, stages, of, development, vs, dynamic, systems, of, development, research, in, developmental, psychology, has, some, limitations, but, at, the, moment, researchers, are, working, to, understand, how, transitioning, through, stages, of, life, and, biological, factors, may, impact, our, behaviors, and, development, developmental, psychology, involves, a, range, of, fields, such, as, educational, psychology, child, psychopathology, forensic, developmental, psychology, child, development, cognitive, psychology, ecological, psychology, and, cultural, psychology, influential, developmental, psychologists, from, the, 20th, century, include, urie, bronfenbrenner, erik, erikson, sigmund, freud, anna, freud, jean, piaget, barbara, rogoff, esther, thelen, and, lev, vygotsky, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, john, b, watson, are, typically, cited, as, providing, the, foundation, for, modern, developmental, psychology, in, the, mid, 18th, century, jean, jacques, rousseau, described, three, stages, of, development, infants, infancy, puer, childhood, and, adolescence, in, emile, or, on, education, rousseau, s, ideas, were, adopted, and, supported, by, educators, at, the, time, developmental, psychology, generally, focuses, on, how, and, why, certain, changes, cognitive, social, intellectual, personality, occur, over, time, in, the, course, of, a, human, life, many, theorists, have, made, a, profound, contribution, to, this, area, of, psychology, one, of, them, erik, erikson, developed, a, model, of, eight, stages, of, psychological, development, he, believed, that, humans, developed, in, stages, throughout, their, lifetimes, and, that, this, would, affect, their, behaviors, in, the, late, 19th, century, psychologists, familiar, with, the, evolutionary, theory, of, darwin, began, seeking, an, evolutionary, description, of, psychological, development, prominent, here, was, the, pioneering, psychologist, g, stanley, hall, who, attempted, to, correlate, ages, of, childhood, with, previous, ages, of, humanity, james, mark, baldwin, who, wrote, essays, on, topics, that, included, imitation, a, chapter, in, the, natural, history, of, consciousness, and, mental, development, in, the, child, and, the, race, methods, and, processes, was, significantly, involved, in, the, theory, of, developmental, psychology, sigmund, freud, whose, concepts, were, developmental, significantly, affected, public, perceptions, sigmund, freud, developed, a, theory, that, suggested, that, humans, behave, as, they, do, because, they, are, constantly, seeking, pleasure, this, process, of, seeking, pleasure, changes, through, stages, because, people, evolve, each, period, of, seeking, pleasure, that, a, person, experiences, is, represented, by, a, stage, of, psychosexual, development, these, stages, symbolize, the, process, of, arriving, to, become, a, maturing, adult, the, first, is, the, oral, stage, which, begins, at, birth, and, ends, around, a, year, and, a, half, of, age, during, the, oral, stage, the, child, finds, pleasure, in, behaviors, like, sucking, or, other, behaviors, with, the, mouth, the, second, is, the, anal, stage, from, about, a, year, or, a, year, and, a, half, to, three, years, of, age, during, the, anal, stage, the, child, defecates, from, the, anus, and, is, often, fascinated, with, its, defecation, this, period, of, development, often, occurs, during, the, time, when, the, child, is, being, toilet, trained, the, child, becomes, interested, with, feces, and, urine, children, begin, to, see, themselves, as, independent, from, their, parents, they, begin, to, desire, assertiveness, and, autonomy, the, third, is, the, phallic, stage, which, occurs, from, three, to, five, years, of, age, most, of, a, person, s, personality, forms, by, this, age, during, the, phallic, stage, the, child, becomes, aware, of, its, sexual, organs, pleasure, comes, from, finding, acceptance, and, love, from, the, opposite, sex, the, fourth, is, the, latency, stage, which, occurs, from, age, five, until, puberty, during, the, latency, stage, the, child, s, sexual, interests, are, repressed, stage, five, is, the, genital, stage, which, takes, place, from, puberty, until, adulthood, during, the, genital, stage, puberty, begins, to, occur, children, have, now, matured, and, begin, to, think, about, other, people, instead, of, just, themselves, pleasure, comes, from, feelings, of, affection, from, other, people, freud, believed, there, is, tension, between, the, conscious, and, unconscious, because, the, conscious, tries, to, hold, back, what, the, unconscious, tries, to, express, to, explain, this, he, developed, three, personality, structures, id, ego, and, superego, the, id, the, most, primitive, of, the, three, functions, according, to, the, pleasure, principle, seek, pleasure, and, avoid, pain, the, superego, plays, the, critical, and, moralizing, role, while, the, ego, is, the, organized, realistic, part, that, mediates, between, the, desires, of, the, id, and, the, superego, jean, piaget, a, swiss, theorist, posited, that, children, learn, by, actively, constructing, knowledge, through, their, interactions, with, their, physical, and, social, environments, he, suggested, that, the, adult, s, role, in, helping, the, child, learn, was, to, provide, appropriate, materials, in, his, interview, techniques, with, children, that, formed, an, empirical, basis, for, his, theories, he, used, something, similar, to, socratic, questioning, to, get, children, to, reveal, their, thinking, he, argued, that, a, principal, source, of, development, was, through, the, child, s, inevitable, generation, of, contradictions, through, their, interactions, with, their, physical, and, social, worlds, the, child, s, resolution, of, these, contradictions, led, to, more, integrated, and, advanced, forms, of, interaction, a, developmental, process, that, he, called, equilibration, piaget, argued, that, intellectual, development, takes, place, through, a, series, of, stages, generated, through, the, equilibration, process, each, stage, consists, of, steps, the, child, must, master, before, moving, to, the, next, step, he, believed, that, these, stages, are, not, separate, from, one, another, but, rather, that, each, stage, builds, on, the, previous, one, in, a, continuous, learning, process, he, proposed, four, stages, sensorimotor, pre, operational, concrete, operational, and, formal, operational, though, he, did, not, believe, these, stages, occurred, at, any, given, age, many, studies, have, determined, when, these, cognitive, abilities, should, take, place, piaget, claimed, that, logic, and, morality, develop, through, constructive, stages, expanding, on, piaget, s, work, lawrence, kohlberg, determined, that, the, process, of, moral, development, was, principally, concerned, with, justice, and, that, it, continued, throughout, the, individual, s, lifetime, he, suggested, three, levels, of, moral, reasoning, pre, conventional, moral, reasoning, conventional, moral, reasoning, and, post, conventional, moral, reasoning, the, pre, conventional, moral, reasoning, is, typical, of, children, and, is, characterized, by, reasoning, that, is, based, on, rewards, and, punishments, associated, with, different, courses, of, action, conventional, moral, reason, occurs, during, late, childhood, and, early, adolescence, and, is, characterized, by, reasoning, based, on, rules, and, conventions, of, society, lastly, post, conventional, moral, reasoning, is, a, stage, during, which, the, individual, sees, society, s, rules, and, conventions, as, relative, and, subjective, rather, than, as, authoritative, kohlberg, used, the, heinz, dilemma, to, apply, to, his, stages, of, moral, development, the, heinz, dilemma, involves, heinz, s, wife, dying, from, cancer, and, heinz, having, the, dilemma, to, save, his, wife, by, stealing, a, drug, preconventional, morality, conventional, morality, and, post, conventional, morality, applies, to, heinz, s, situation, german, american, psychologist, erik, erikson, and, his, collaborator, and, wife, joan, erikson, posits, eight, stages, of, individual, human, development, influenced, by, biological, psychological, and, social, factors, throughout, the, lifespan, at, each, stage, the, person, must, resolve, a, challenge, or, an, existential, dilemma, successful, resolution, of, the, dilemma, results, in, the, person, ingraining, a, positive, virtue, but, failure, to, resolve, the, fundamental, challenge, of, that, stage, reinforces, negative, perceptions, of, the, person, or, the, world, around, them, and, the, person, s, personal, development, is, unable, to, progress, the, first, stage, trust, vs, mistrust, takes, place, in, infancy, the, positive, virtue, for, the, first, stage, is, hope, in, the, infant, learning, whom, to, trust, and, having, hope, for, a, supportive, group, of, people, to, be, there, for, him, her, the, second, stage, is, autonomy, vs, shame, and, doubt, with, the, positive, virtue, being, will, this, takes, place, in, early, childhood, when, the, child, learns, to, become, more, independent, by, discovering, what, they, are, capable, of, whereas, if, the, child, is, overly, controlled, feelings, of, inadequacy, are, reinforced, which, can, lead, to, low, self, esteem, and, doubt, the, third, stage, is, initiative, vs, guilt, the, virtue, of, being, gained, is, a, sense, of, purpose, this, takes, place, primarily, via, play, this, is, the, stage, where, the, child, will, be, curious, and, have, many, interactions, with, other, kids, they, will, ask, many, questions, as, their, curiosity, grows, if, too, much, guilt, is, present, the, child, may, have, a, slower, and, harder, time, interacting, with, their, world, and, other, children, in, it, the, fourth, stage, is, industry, competence, vs, inferiority, the, virtue, for, this, stage, is, competency, and, is, the, result, of, the, child, s, early, experiences, in, school, this, stage, is, when, the, child, will, try, to, win, the, approval, of, others, and, understand, the, value, of, their, accomplishments, the, fifth, stage, is, identity, vs, role, confusion, the, virtue, gained, is, fidelity, and, it, takes, place, in, adolescence, this, is, when, the, child, ideally, starts, to, identify, their, place, in, society, particularly, in, terms, of, their, gender, role, the, sixth, stage, is, intimacy, vs, isolation, which, happens, in, young, adults, and, the, virtue, gained, is, love, this, is, when, the, person, starts, to, share, his, her, life, with, someone, else, intimately, and, emotionally, not, doing, so, can, reinforce, feelings, of, isolation, the, seventh, stage, is, generativity, vs, stagnation, this, happens, in, adulthood, and, the, virtue, gained, is, care, a, person, becomes, stable, and, starts, to, give, back, by, raising, a, family, and, becoming, involved, in, the, community, the, eighth, stage, is, ego, integrity, vs, despair, when, one, grows, old, they, look, back, on, their, life, and, contemplate, their, successes, and, failures, if, they, resolve, this, positively, the, virtue, of, wisdom, is, gained, this, is, also, the, stage, when, one, can, gain, a, sense, of, closure, and, accept, death, without, regret, or, fear, michael, commons, enhanced, and, simplified, b, rbel, inhelder, and, piaget, s, developmental, theory, and, offers, a, standard, method, of, examining, the, universal, pattern, of, development, the, model, of, hierarchical, complexity, mhc, is, not, based, on, the, assessment, of, domain, specific, information, it, divides, the, order, of, hierarchical, complexity, of, tasks, to, be, addressed, from, the, stage, performance, on, those, tasks, a, stage, is, the, order, hierarchical, complexity, of, the, tasks, the, participant, s, successfully, addresses, he, expanded, piaget, s, original, eight, stage, counting, the, half, stages, to, seventeen, stages, the, stages, are, the, order, of, hierarchical, complexity, of, tasks, predicts, how, difficult, the, performance, is, with, an, r, ranging, from, 0, 9, to, 0, 98, in, the, mhc, there, are, three, main, axioms, for, an, order, to, meet, in, order, for, the, higher, order, task, to, coordinate, the, next, lower, order, task, axioms, are, rules, that, are, followed, to, determine, how, the, mhc, orders, actions, to, form, a, hierarchy, these, axioms, are, a, defined, in, terms, of, tasks, at, the, next, lower, order, of, hierarchical, complexity, task, action, b, defined, as, the, higher, order, task, action, that, organizes, two, or, more, less, complex, actions, that, is, the, more, complex, action, specifies, the, way, in, which, the, less, complex, actions, combine, c, defined, as, the, lower, order, task, actions, have, to, be, carried, out, non, arbitrarily, ecological, systems, theory, originally, formulated, by, urie, bronfenbrenner, specifies, four, types, of, nested, environmental, systems, with, bi, directional, influences, within, and, between, the, systems, the, four, systems, are, microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and, macrosystem, each, system, contains, roles, norms, and, rules, that, can, powerfully, shape, development, the, microsystem, is, the, direct, environment, in, our, lives, such, as, our, home, and, school, mesosystem, is, how, relationships, connect, to, the, microsystem, exosystem, is, a, larger, social, system, where, the, child, plays, no, role, macrosystem, refers, to, the, cultural, values, customs, and, laws, of, society, the, microsystem, is, the, immediate, environment, surrounding, and, influencing, the, individual, example, school, or, the, home, setting, the, mesosystem, is, the, combination, of, two, microsystems, and, how, they, influence, each, other, example, sibling, relationships, at, home, vs, peer, relationships, at, school, the, exosystem, is, the, interaction, among, two, or, more, settings, that, are, indirectly, linked, example, a, father, s, job, requiring, more, overtime, ends, up, influencing, his, daughter, s, performance, in, school, because, he, can, no, longer, help, with, her, homework, the, macrosystem, is, broader, taking, into, account, social, economic, status, culture, beliefs, customs, and, morals, example, a, child, from, a, wealthier, family, sees, a, peer, from, a, less, wealthy, family, as, inferior, for, that, reason, lastly, the, chronosystem, refers, to, the, chronological, nature, of, life, events, and, how, they, interact, and, change, the, individual, and, their, circumstances, through, transition, example, a, mother, losing, her, own, mother, to, illness, and, no, longer, having, that, support, in, her, life, since, its, publication, in, 1979, bronfenbrenner, s, major, statement, of, this, theory, the, ecology, of, human, development, has, had, widespread, influence, on, the, way, psychologists, and, others, approach, the, study, of, human, beings, and, their, environments, as, a, result, of, this, conceptualization, of, development, these, environments, from, the, family, to, economic, and, political, structures, have, come, to, be, viewed, as, part, of, the, life, course, from, childhood, through, to, adulthood, lev, vygotsky, was, a, russian, theorist, from, the, soviet, era, who, posited, that, children, learn, through, hands, on, experience, and, social, interactions, with, members, of, their, culture, vygotsky, believed, that, a, child, s, development, should, be, examined, during, problem, solving, activities, unlike, piaget, he, claimed, that, timely, and, sensitive, intervention, by, adults, when, a, child, is, on, the, edge, of, learning, a, new, task, called, the, zone, of, proximal, development, could, help, children, learn, new, tasks, zone, of, proximal, development, is, a, tool, used, to, explain, the, learning, of, children, and, collaborating, problem, solving, activities, with, an, adult, or, peer, this, adult, role, is, often, referred, to, as, the, skilled, master, whereas, the, child, is, considered, the, learning, apprentice, through, an, educational, process, often, termed, cognitive, apprenticeship, martin, hill, stated, that, the, world, of, reality, does, not, apply, to, the, mind, of, a, child, this, technique, is, called, scaffolding, because, it, builds, upon, knowledge, children, already, have, with, new, knowledge, that, adults, can, help, the, child, learn, vygotsky, was, strongly, focused, on, the, role, of, culture, in, determining, the, child, s, pattern, of, development, arguing, that, development, moves, from, the, social, level, to, the, individual, level, in, other, words, vygotsky, claimed, that, psychology, should, focus, on, the, progress, of, human, consciousness, through, the, relationship, of, an, individual, and, their, environment, he, felt, that, if, scholars, continued, to, disregard, this, connection, then, this, disregard, would, inhibit, the, full, comprehension, of, the, human, consciousness, constructivism, is, a, paradigm, in, psychology, that, characterizes, learning, as, a, process, of, actively, constructing, knowledge, individuals, create, meaning, for, themselves, or, make, sense, of, new, information, by, selecting, organizing, and, integrating, information, with, other, knowledge, often, in, the, context, of, social, interactions, constructivism, can, occur, in, two, ways, individual, and, social, individual, constructivism, is, when, a, person, constructs, knowledge, through, cognitive, processes, of, their, own, experiences, rather, than, by, memorizing, facts, provided, by, others, social, constructivism, is, when, individuals, construct, knowledge, through, an, interaction, between, the, knowledge, they, bring, to, a, situation, and, social, or, cultural, exchanges, within, that, content, a, foundational, concept, of, constructivism, is, that, the, purpose, of, cognition, is, to, organize, one, s, experiential, world, instead, of, the, ontological, world, around, them, jean, piaget, a, swiss, developmental, psychologist, proposed, that, learning, is, an, active, process, because, children, learn, through, experience, and, make, mistakes, and, solve, problems, piaget, proposed, that, learning, should, be, whole, by, helping, students, understand, that, meaning, is, constructed, evolutionary, developmental, psychology, is, a, research, paradigm, that, applies, the, basic, principles, of, darwinian, evolution, particularly, natural, selection, to, understand, the, development, of, human, behavior, and, cognition, it, involves, the, study, of, both, the, genetic, and, environmental, mechanisms, that, underlie, the, development, of, social, and, cognitive, competencies, as, well, as, the, epigenetic, gene, environment, interactions, processes, that, adapt, these, competencies, to, local, conditions, edp, considers, both, the, reliably, developing, species, typical, features, of, ontogeny, developmental, adaptations, as, well, as, individual, differences, in, behavior, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, while, evolutionary, views, tend, to, regard, most, individual, differences, as, the, result, of, either, random, genetic, noise, evolutionary, byproducts, and, or, idiosyncrasies, for, example, peer, groups, education, neighborhoods, and, chance, encounters, rather, than, products, of, natural, selection, edp, asserts, that, natural, selection, can, favor, the, emergence, of, individual, differences, via, adaptive, developmental, plasticity, from, this, perspective, human, development, follows, alternative, life, history, strategies, in, response, to, environmental, variability, rather, than, following, one, species, typical, pattern, of, development, edp, is, closely, linked, to, the, theoretical, framework, of, evolutionary, psychology, ep, but, is, also, distinct, from, ep, in, several, domains, including, research, emphasis, edp, focuses, on, adaptations, of, ontogeny, as, opposed, to, adaptations, of, adulthood, and, consideration, of, proximate, ontogenetic, and, environmental, factors, i, e, how, development, happens, in, addition, to, more, ultimate, factors, i, e, why, development, happens, which, are, the, focus, of, mainstream, evolutionary, psychology, attachment, theory, originally, developed, by, john, bowlby, focuses, on, the, importance, of, open, intimate, emotionally, meaningful, relationships, attachment, is, described, as, a, biological, system, or, powerful, survival, impulse, that, evolved, to, ensure, the, survival, of, the, infant, a, threatened, or, stressed, child, will, move, toward, caregivers, who, create, a, sense, of, physical, emotional, and, psychological, safety, for, the, individual, attachment, feeds, on, body, contact, and, familiarity, later, mary, ainsworth, developed, the, strange, situation, protocol, and, the, concept, of, the, secure, base, this, tool, has, been, found, to, help, understand, attachment, such, as, the, strange, situation, test, and, the, adult, attachment, interview, both, of, which, help, determine, factors, to, certain, attachment, styles, the, strange, situation, test, helps, find, disturbances, in, attachment, and, whether, certain, attributes, are, found, to, contribute, to, a, certain, attachment, issue, the, adult, attachment, interview, is, a, tool, that, is, similar, to, the, strange, situation, test, but, instead, focuses, attachment, issues, found, in, adults, both, tests, have, helped, many, researchers, gain, more, information, on, the, risks, and, how, to, identify, them, theorists, have, proposed, four, types, of, attachment, styles, secure, anxious, avoidant, anxious, resistant, and, disorganized, secure, attachment, is, a, healthy, attachment, between, the, infant, and, the, caregiver, it, is, characterized, by, trust, anxious, avoidant, is, an, insecure, attachment, between, an, infant, and, a, caregiver, this, is, characterized, by, the, infant, s, indifference, toward, the, caregiver, anxious, resistant, is, an, insecure, attachment, between, the, infant, and, the, caregiver, characterized, by, distress, from, the, infant, when, separated, and, anger, when, reunited, disorganized, is, an, attachment, style, without, a, consistent, pattern, of, responses, upon, return, of, the, parent, a, child, can, be, hindered, in, its, natural, tendency, to, form, attachments, some, babies, are, raised, without, the, stimulation, and, attention, of, a, regular, caregiver, or, locked, away, under, conditions, of, abuse, or, extreme, neglect, the, possible, short, term, effects, of, this, deprivation, are, anger, despair, detachment, and, temporary, delay, in, intellectual, development, long, term, effects, include, increased, aggression, clinging, behavior, detachment, psychosomatic, disorders, and, an, increased, risk, of, depression, as, an, adult, according, to, the, theory, attachment, is, established, in, early, childhood, and, attachment, continues, into, adulthood, as, such, proponents, posit, that, the, attachment, style, that, individuals, form, in, childhood, impacts, the, way, they, manage, stressors, in, intimate, relationships, as, an, adult, a, significant, debate, in, developmental, psychology, is, the, relationship, between, innateness, and, environmental, influence, in, regard, to, any, particular, aspect, of, development, this, is, often, referred, to, as, nature, and, nurture, or, nativism, versus, empiricism, a, nativist, account, of, development, would, argue, that, the, processes, in, question, are, innate, that, is, they, are, specified, by, the, organism, s, genes, what, makes, a, person, who, they, are, is, it, their, environment, or, their, genetics, this, is, the, debate, of, nature, vs, nurture, an, empiricist, perspective, would, argue, that, those, processes, are, acquired, in, interaction, with, the, environment, today, developmental, psychologists, rarely, take, such, polarized, positions, with, regard, to, most, aspects, of, development, rather, they, investigate, among, many, other, things, the, relationship, between, innate, and, environmental, influences, one, of, the, ways, this, relationship, has, been, explored, in, recent, years, is, through, the, emerging, field, of, evolutionary, developmental, psychology, one, area, where, this, innateness, debate, has, been, prominently, portrayed, is, in, research, on, language, acquisition, a, major, question, in, this, area, is, whether, or, not, certain, properties, of, human, language, are, specified, genetically, or, can, be, acquired, through, learning, the, empiricist, position, on, the, issue, of, language, acquisition, suggests, that, the, language, input, provides, the, necessary, information, required, for, learning, the, structure, of, language, and, that, infants, acquire, language, through, a, process, of, statistical, learning, from, this, perspective, language, can, be, acquired, via, general, learning, methods, that, also, apply, to, other, aspects, of, development, such, as, perceptual, learning, the, nativist, position, argues, that, the, input, from, language, is, too, impoverished, for, infants, and, children, to, acquire, the, structure, of, language, linguist, noam, chomsky, asserts, that, evidenced, by, the, lack, of, sufficient, information, in, the, language, input, there, is, a, universal, grammar, that, applies, to, all, human, languages, and, is, pre, specified, this, has, led, to, the, idea, that, there, is, a, special, cognitive, module, suited, for, learning, language, often, called, the, language, acquisition, device, chomsky, s, critique, of, the, behaviorist, model, of, language, acquisition, is, regarded, by, many, as, a, key, turning, point, in, the, decline, in, the, prominence, of, the, theory, of, behaviorism, generally, but, skinner, s, conception, of, verbal, behavior, has, not, died, perhaps, in, part, because, it, has, generated, successful, practical, applications, maybe, there, could, be, strong, interactions, of, both, nature, and, nurture, one, of, the, major, discussions, in, developmental, psychology, includes, whether, development, is, discontinuous, or, continuous, continuous, development, is, quantifiable, and, quantitative, whereas, discontinuous, development, is, qualitative, quantitative, estimations, of, development, can, be, measuring, the, stature, of, a, child, and, measuring, their, memory, or, consideration, span, particularly, dramatic, examples, of, qualitative, changes, are, metamorphoses, such, as, the, emergence, of, a, caterpillar, into, a, butterfly, those, psychologists, who, bolster, the, continuous, view, of, improvement, propose, that, improvement, includes, slow, and, progressing, changes, all, through, the, life, span, with, behavior, within, the, prior, stages, of, advancement, giving, the, premise, of, abilities, and, capacities, required, for, the, other, stages, to, many, the, concept, of, continuous, quantifiable, measurement, seems, to, be, the, essence, of, science, not, all, psychologists, be, that, as, it, may, concur, that, advancement, could, be, a, continuous, process, a, few, see, advancement, as, a, discontinuous, process, they, accept, advancement, includes, unmistakable, and, partitioned, stages, with, diverse, sorts, of, behavior, happening, in, each, organization, this, proposes, that, the, development, of, certain, capacities, in, each, arrange, such, as, particular, feelings, or, ways, of, considering, have, a, definite, beginning, and, finishing, point, be, that, as, it, may, there, s, no, correct, time, at, which, a, capacity, abruptly, shows, up, or, disappears, although, some, sorts, of, considering, feeling, or, carrying, on, could, seem, to, seem, abruptly, it, is, more, than, likely, that, this, has, been, developing, gradually, for, some, time, stage, theories, of, development, rest, on, the, suspicion, that, development, may, be, a, discontinuous, process, including, particular, stages, which, are, characterized, by, subjective, contrasts, in, behavior, they, moreover, assume, that, the, structure, of, the, stages, is, not, variable, concurring, to, each, person, in, any, case, the, time, of, each, arrangement, may, shift, separately, stage, theories, can, be, differentiated, with, ceaseless, hypotheses, which, set, that, development, is, an, incremental, process, this, issue, involves, the, degree, to, which, one, becomes, older, renditions, of, their, early, experience, or, whether, they, develop, into, something, different, from, who, they, were, at, an, earlier, point, in, development, it, considers, the, extent, to, which, early, experiences, especially, infancy, or, later, experiences, are, the, key, determinants, of, a, person, s, development, stability, is, defined, as, the, consistent, ordering, of, individual, differences, with, respect, to, some, attribute, change, is, altering, someone, something, most, human, development, lifespan, developmentalists, recognize, that, extreme, positions, are, unwise, therefore, the, key, to, a, comprehensive, understanding, of, development, at, any, stage, requires, the, interaction, of, different, factors, and, not, only, one, theory, of, mind, is, the, ability, to, attribute, mental, states, to, ourselves, and, others, it, is, a, complex, but, vital, process, in, which, children, begin, to, understand, the, emotions, motives, and, feelings, of, not, only, themselves, but, also, others, theory, of, mind, allows, people, to, understand, that, others, have, unique, beliefs, and, desires, that, are, different, from, our, own, this, enables, people, to, engage, in, daily, social, interactions, as, we, explain, the, mental, state, around, us, if, a, child, does, not, fully, develop, theory, of, mind, within, this, crucial, 5, year, period, they, can, suffer, from, communication, barriers, that, follow, them, into, adolescence, and, adulthood, exposure, to, more, people, and, the, availability, of, stimuli, that, encourages, social, cognitive, growth, is, a, factor, that, relies, heavily, on, family, developmental, psychology, is, concerned, not, only, with, describing, the, characteristics, of, psychological, change, over, time, but, also, seeks, to, explain, the, principles, and, internal, workings, underlying, these, changes, psychologists, have, attempted, to, better, understand, these, factors, by, using, models, a, model, must, simply, account, for, the, means, by, which, a, process, takes, place, this, is, sometimes, done, in, reference, to, changes, in, the, brain, that, may, correspond, to, changes, in, behavior, over, the, course, of, the, development, mathematical, modeling, is, useful, in, developmental, psychology, for, implementing, theory, in, a, precise, and, easy, to, study, manner, allowing, generation, explanation, integration, and, prediction, of, diverse, phenomena, several, modeling, techniques, are, applied, to, development, symbolic, connectionist, neural, network, or, dynamical, systems, models, dynamic, systems, models, illustrate, how, many, different, features, of, a, complex, system, may, interact, to, yield, emergent, behaviors, and, abilities, nonlinear, dynamics, has, been, applied, to, human, systems, specifically, to, address, issues, that, require, attention, to, temporality, such, as, life, transitions, human, development, and, behavioral, or, emotional, change, over, time, nonlinear, dynamic, systems, is, currently, being, explored, as, a, way, to, explain, discrete, phenomena, of, human, development, such, as, affect, second, language, acquisition, and, locomotion, one, critical, aspect, of, developmental, psychology, is, the, study, of, neural, development, which, investigates, how, the, brain, changes, and, develops, during, different, stages, of, life, neural, development, focuses, on, how, the, brain, changes, and, develops, during, different, stages, of, life, studies, have, shown, that, the, human, brain, undergoes, rapid, changes, during, prenatal, and, early, postnatal, periods, these, changes, include, the, formation, of, neurons, the, development, of, neural, networks, and, the, establishment, of, synaptic, connections, the, formation, of, neurons, and, the, establishment, of, basic, neural, circuits, in, the, developing, brain, are, crucial, for, laying, the, foundation, of, the, brain, s, structure, and, function, and, disruptions, during, this, period, can, have, long, term, effects, on, cognitive, and, emotional, development, experiences, and, environmental, factors, play, a, crucial, role, in, shaping, neural, development, early, sensory, experiences, such, as, exposure, to, language, and, visual, stimuli, can, influence, the, development, of, neural, pathways, related, to, perception, and, language, processing, genetic, factors, play, a, huge, roll, in, neural, development, genetic, factors, can, influence, the, timing, and, pattern, of, neural, development, as, well, as, the, susceptibility, to, certain, developmental, disorders, such, as, autism, spectrum, disorder, and, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, research, finds, that, the, adolescent, brain, undergoes, significant, changes, in, neural, connectivity, and, plasticity, during, this, period, there, is, a, pruning, process, where, certain, neural, connections, are, strengthened, while, others, are, eliminated, resulting, in, more, efficient, neural, networks, and, increased, cognitive, abilities, such, as, decision, making, and, impulse, control, the, study, of, neural, development, provides, crucial, insights, into, the, complex, interplay, between, genetics, environment, and, experiences, in, shaping, the, developing, brain, by, understanding, the, neural, processes, underlying, developmental, changes, researchers, gain, a, better, understanding, of, cognitive, emotional, and, social, development, in, humans, cognitive, development, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, ways, that, infants, and, children, acquire, develop, and, use, internal, mental, capabilities, such, as, problem, solving, memory, and, language, major, topics, in, cognitive, development, are, the, study, of, language, acquisition, and, the, development, of, perceptual, and, motor, skills, piaget, was, one, of, the, influential, early, psychologists, to, study, the, development, of, cognitive, abilities, his, theory, suggests, that, development, proceeds, through, a, set, of, stages, from, infancy, to, adulthood, and, that, there, is, an, end, point, or, goal, other, accounts, such, as, that, of, lev, vygotsky, have, suggested, that, development, does, not, progress, through, stages, but, rather, that, the, developmental, process, that, begins, at, birth, and, continues, until, death, is, too, complex, for, such, structure, and, finality, rather, from, this, viewpoint, developmental, processes, proceed, more, continuously, thus, development, should, be, analyzed, instead, of, treated, as, a, product, to, obtain, k, warner, schaie, has, expanded, the, study, of, cognitive, development, into, adulthood, rather, than, being, stable, from, adolescence, schaie, sees, adults, as, progressing, in, the, application, of, their, cognitive, abilities, modern, cognitive, development, has, integrated, the, considerations, of, cognitive, psychology, and, the, psychology, of, individual, differences, into, the, interpretation, and, modeling, of, development, specifically, the, neo, piagetian, theories, of, cognitive, development, showed, that, the, successive, levels, or, stages, of, cognitive, development, are, associated, with, increasing, processing, efficiency, and, working, memory, capacity, these, increases, explain, differences, between, stages, progression, to, higher, stages, and, individual, differences, of, children, who, are, the, same, age, and, of, the, same, grade, level, however, other, theories, have, moved, away, from, piagetian, stage, theories, and, are, influenced, by, accounts, of, domain, specific, information, processing, which, posit, that, development, is, guided, by, innate, evolutionarily, specified, and, content, specific, information, processing, mechanisms, developmental, psychologists, who, are, interested, in, social, development, examine, how, individuals, develop, social, and, emotional, competencies, for, example, they, study, how, children, form, friendships, how, they, understand, and, deal, with, emotions, and, how, identity, develops, research, in, this, area, may, involve, study, of, the, relationship, between, cognition, or, cognitive, development, and, social, behavior, emotional, regulation, or, er, refers, to, an, individual, s, ability, to, modulate, emotional, responses, across, a, variety, of, contexts, in, young, children, this, modulation, is, in, part, controlled, externally, by, parents, and, other, authority, figures, as, children, develop, they, take, on, more, and, more, responsibility, for, their, internal, state, studies, have, shown, that, the, development, of, er, is, affected, by, the, emotional, regulation, children, observe, in, parents, and, caretakers, the, emotional, climate, in, the, home, and, the, reaction, of, parents, and, caretakers, to, the, child, s, emotions, music, also, has, an, influence, on, stimulating, and, enhancing, the, senses, of, a, child, through, self, expression, a, child, s, social, and, emotional, development, can, be, disrupted, by, motor, coordination, problems, evidenced, by, the, environmental, stress, hypothesis, the, environmental, hypothesis, explains, how, children, with, coordination, problems, and, developmental, coordination, disorder, are, exposed, to, several, psychosocial, consequences, which, act, as, secondary, stressors, leading, to, an, increase, in, internalizing, symptoms, such, as, depression, and, anxiety, motor, coordination, problems, affect, fine, and, gross, motor, movement, as, well, as, perceptual, motor, skills, secondary, stressors, commonly, identified, include, the, tendency, for, children, with, poor, motor, skills, to, be, less, likely, to, participate, in, organized, play, with, other, children, and, more, likely, to, feel, socially, isolated, social, and, emotional, development, focuses, on, five, keys, areas, self, awareness, self, management, social, awareness, relationship, skills, and, responsible, decision, making, physical, development, concerns, the, physical, maturation, of, an, individual, s, body, until, it, reaches, the, adult, stature, although, physical, growth, is, a, highly, regular, process, all, children, differ, tremendously, in, the, timing, of, their, growth, spurts, studies, are, being, done, to, analyze, how, the, differences, in, these, timings, affect, and, are, related, to, other, variables, of, developmental, psychology, such, as, information, processing, speed, traditional, measures, of, physical, maturity, using, x, rays, are, less, in, practice, nowadays, compared, to, simple, measurements, of, body, parts, such, as, height, weight, head, circumference, and, arm, span, a, few, other, studies, and, practices, with, physical, developmental, psychology, are, the, phonological, abilities, of, mature, 5, to, 11, year, olds, and, the, controversial, hypotheses, of, left, handers, being, maturationally, delayed, compared, to, right, handers, a, study, by, eaton, chipperfield, ritchot, and, kostiuk, in, 1996, found, in, three, different, samples, that, there, was, no, difference, between, right, and, left, handers, researchers, interested, in, memory, development, look, at, the, way, our, memory, develops, from, childhood, and, onward, according, to, fuzzy, trace, theory, a, theory, of, cognition, originally, proposed, by, valerie, f, reyna, and, charles, brainerd, people, have, two, separate, memory, processes, verbatim, and, gist, these, two, traces, begin, to, develop, at, different, times, as, well, as, at, a, different, pace, children, as, young, as, four, years, old, have, verbatim, memory, memory, for, surface, information, which, increases, up, to, early, adulthood, at, which, point, it, begins, to, decline, on, the, other, hand, our, capacity, for, gist, memory, memory, for, semantic, information, increases, up, to, early, adulthood, at, which, point, it, is, consistent, through, old, age, furthermore, one, s, reliance, on, gist, memory, traces, increases, as, one, ages, developmental, psychology, employs, many, of, the, research, methods, used, in, other, areas, of, psychology, however, infants, and, children, cannot, be, tested, in, the, same, ways, as, adults, so, different, methods, are, often, used, to, study, their, development, developmental, psychologists, have, a, number, of, methods, to, study, changes, in, individuals, over, time, common, research, methods, include, systematic, observation, including, naturalistic, observation, or, structured, observation, self, reports, which, could, be, clinical, interviews, or, structured, interviews, clinical, or, case, study, method, and, ethnography, or, participant, observation, 31, 35, these, methods, differ, in, the, extent, of, control, researchers, impose, on, study, conditions, and, how, they, construct, ideas, about, which, variables, to, study, every, developmental, investigation, can, be, characterized, in, terms, of, whether, its, underlying, strategy, involves, the, experimental, correlational, or, case, study, approach, the, experimental, method, involves, actual, manipulation, of, various, treatments, circumstances, or, events, to, which, the, participant, or, subject, is, exposed, the, experimental, design, points, to, cause, and, effect, relationships, this, method, allows, for, strong, inferences, to, be, made, of, causal, relationships, between, the, manipulation, of, one, or, more, independent, variables, and, subsequent, behavior, as, measured, by, the, dependent, variable, the, advantage, of, using, this, research, method, is, that, it, permits, determination, of, cause, and, effect, relationships, among, variables, on, the, other, hand, the, limitation, is, that, data, obtained, in, an, artificial, environment, may, lack, generalizability, the, correlational, method, explores, the, relationship, between, two, or, more, events, by, gathering, information, about, these, variables, without, researcher, intervention, the, advantage, of, using, a, correlational, design, is, that, it, estimates, the, strength, and, direction, of, relationships, among, variables, in, the, natural, environment, however, the, limitation, is, that, it, does, not, permit, determination, of, cause, and, effect, relationships, among, variables, the, case, study, approach, allows, investigations, to, obtain, an, in, depth, understanding, of, an, individual, participant, by, collecting, data, based, on, interviews, structured, questionnaires, observations, and, test, scores, each, of, these, methods, have, its, strengths, and, weaknesses, but, the, experimental, method, when, appropriate, is, the, preferred, method, of, developmental, scientists, because, it, provides, a, controlled, situation, and, conclusions, to, be, drawn, about, cause, and, effect, relationships, most, developmental, studies, regardless, of, whether, they, employ, the, experimental, correlational, or, case, study, method, can, also, be, constructed, using, research, designs, research, designs, are, logical, frameworks, used, to, make, key, comparisons, within, research, studies, such, as, in, a, longitudinal, study, a, researcher, observes, many, individuals, born, at, or, around, the, same, time, a, cohort, and, carries, out, new, observations, as, members, of, the, cohort, age, this, method, can, be, used, to, draw, conclusions, about, which, types, of, development, are, universal, or, normative, and, occur, in, most, members, of, a, cohort, as, an, example, a, longitudinal, study, of, early, literacy, development, examined, in, detail, the, early, literacy, experiences, of, one, child, in, each, of, 30, families, researchers, may, also, observe, ways, that, development, varies, between, individuals, and, hypothesize, about, the, causes, of, variation, in, their, data, longitudinal, studies, often, require, large, amounts, of, time, and, funding, making, them, unfeasible, in, some, situations, also, because, members, of, a, cohort, all, experience, historical, events, unique, to, their, generation, apparently, normative, developmental, trends, may, in, fact, be, universal, only, to, their, cohort, 40, in, a, cross, sectional, study, a, researcher, observes, differences, between, individuals, of, different, ages, at, the, same, time, this, generally, requires, fewer, resources, than, the, longitudinal, method, and, because, the, individuals, come, from, different, cohorts, shared, historical, events, are, not, so, much, of, a, confounding, factor, by, the, same, token, however, cross, sectional, research, may, not, be, the, most, effective, way, to, study, differences, between, participants, as, these, differences, may, result, not, from, their, different, ages, but, from, their, exposure, to, different, historical, events, 41, a, third, study, design, the, sequential, design, combines, both, methodologies, here, a, researcher, observes, members, of, different, birth, cohorts, at, the, same, time, and, then, tracks, all, participants, over, time, charting, changes, in, the, groups, while, much, more, resource, intensive, the, format, aids, in, a, clearer, distinction, between, what, changes, can, be, attributed, to, an, individual, or, historical, environment, from, those, that, are, truly, universal, 42, because, every, method, has, some, weaknesses, developmental, psychologists, rarely, rely, on, one, study, or, even, one, method, to, reach, conclusions, by, finding, consistent, evidence, from, as, many, converging, sources, as, possible, prenatal, development, is, of, interest, to, psychologists, investigating, the, context, of, early, psychological, development, the, whole, prenatal, development, involves, three, main, stages, germinal, stage, embryonic, stage, and, fetal, stage, germinal, stage, begins, at, conception, until, 2, weeks, embryonic, stage, means, the, development, from, 2, weeks, to, 8, weeks, fetal, stage, represents, 9, weeks, until, birth, of, the, baby, the, senses, develop, in, the, womb, itself, a, fetus, can, both, see, and, hear, by, the, second, trimester, 13, to, 24, weeks, of, age, the, sense, of, touch, develops, in, the, embryonic, stage, 5, to, 8, weeks, 97, most, of, the, brain, s, billions, of, neurons, also, are, developed, by, the, second, trimester, 100, babies, are, hence, born, with, some, odor, taste, and, sound, preferences, largely, related, to, the, mother, s, environment, 101, some, primitive, reflexes, too, arise, before, birth, and, are, still, present, in, newborns, one, hypothesis, is, that, these, reflexes, are, vestigial, and, have, limited, use, in, early, human, life, piaget, s, theory, of, cognitive, development, suggested, that, some, early, reflexes, are, building, blocks, for, infant, sensorimotor, development, for, example, the, tonic, neck, reflex, may, help, development, by, bringing, objects, into, the, infant, s, field, of, view, other, reflexes, such, as, the, walking, reflex, appear, to, be, replaced, by, more, sophisticated, voluntary, control, later, in, infancy, this, may, be, because, the, infant, gains, too, much, weight, after, birth, to, be, strong, enough, to, use, the, reflex, or, because, the, reflex, and, subsequent, development, are, functionally, different, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, some, reflexes, for, example, the, moro, and, walking, reflexes, are, predominantly, adaptations, to, life, in, the, womb, with, little, connection, to, early, infant, development, primitive, reflexes, reappear, in, adults, under, certain, conditions, such, as, neurological, conditions, like, dementia, or, traumatic, lesions, ultrasounds, have, shown, that, infants, are, capable, of, a, range, of, movements, in, the, womb, many, of, which, appear, to, be, more, than, simple, reflexes, by, the, time, they, are, born, infants, can, recognize, and, have, a, preference, for, their, mother, s, voice, suggesting, some, prenatal, development, of, auditory, perception, prenatal, development, and, birth, complications, may, also, be, connected, to, neurodevelopmental, disorders, for, example, in, schizophrenia, with, the, advent, of, cognitive, neuroscience, embryology, and, the, neuroscience, of, prenatal, development, is, of, increasing, interest, to, developmental, psychology, research, several, environmental, agents, teratogens, can, cause, damage, during, the, prenatal, period, these, include, prescription, and, nonprescription, drugs, illegal, drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental, pollutants, infectious, disease, agents, such, as, the, rubella, virus, and, the, toxoplasmosis, parasite, maternal, malnutrition, maternal, emotional, stress, and, rh, factor, blood, incompatibility, between, mother, and, child, 102, 115, there, are, many, statistics, which, prove, the, effects, of, the, aforementioned, substances, a, leading, example, of, this, would, be, that, at, least, 100, 000, cocaine, babies, were, born, in, the, united, states, annually, in, the, late, 1980s, cocaine, babies, are, proven, to, have, quite, severe, and, lasting, difficulties, which, persist, throughout, infancy, and, right, throughout, childhood, the, drug, also, encourages, behavioural, problems, in, the, affected, children, and, defects, of, various, vital, organs, from, birth, until, the, first, year, children, are, referred, to, as, infants, as, they, grow, children, respond, to, their, environment, in, unique, ways, developmental, psychologists, vary, widely, in, their, assessment, of, infant, psychology, and, the, influence, the, outside, world, has, upon, it, the, majority, of, a, newborn, infant, s, time, is, spent, sleeping, at, first, their, sleep, cycles, are, evenly, spread, throughout, the, day, and, night, but, after, a, couple, of, months, infants, generally, become, diurnal, in, human, or, rodent, infants, there, is, always, the, observation, of, a, diurnal, cortisol, rhythm, which, is, sometimes, entrained, with, a, maternal, substance, nevertheless, the, circadian, rhythm, starts, to, take, shape, and, a, 24, hour, rhythm, is, observed, in, just, some, few, months, after, birth, infants, can, be, seen, to, have, six, states, grouped, into, pairs, infant, perception, is, what, a, newborn, can, see, hear, smell, taste, and, touch, these, five, features, are, considered, as, the, five, senses, because, of, these, different, senses, infants, respond, to, stimuli, differently, babies, are, born, with, the, ability, to, discriminate, virtually, all, sounds, of, all, human, languages, 189, infants, of, around, six, months, can, differentiate, between, phonemes, in, their, own, language, but, not, between, similar, phonemes, in, another, language, notably, infants, are, able, to, differentiate, between, various, durations, and, sound, levels, and, can, easily, differentiate, all, the, languages, they, have, encountered, hence, easy, for, infants, to, understand, a, certain, language, compared, to, an, adult, at, this, stage, infants, also, start, to, babble, whereby, they, start, making, vowel, consonant, sound, as, they, try, to, understand, the, true, meaning, of, language, and, copy, whatever, they, are, hearing, in, their, surrounding, producing, their, own, phonemes, in, various, cultures, a, distinct, form, of, speech, called, babytalk, is, used, when, communicating, with, newborns, and, young, children, this, register, consists, of, simplified, terms, for, common, topics, such, as, family, members, food, hygiene, and, familiar, animals, it, also, exhibits, specific, phonological, patterns, such, as, substituting, alveolar, sounds, with, initial, velar, sounds, especially, in, languages, like, english, furthermore, babytalk, often, involves, morphological, simplifications, such, as, regularizing, verb, conjugations, for, instance, saying, corned, instead, of, cornered, or, goed, instead, of, went, this, language, is, typically, taught, to, children, and, is, perceived, as, their, natural, way, of, communication, interestingly, in, mythology, and, popular, culture, certain, characters, such, as, the, hausa, trickster, or, the, warner, bros, cartoon, character, tweety, pie, are, portrayed, as, speaking, in, a, babytalk, like, manner, piaget, suggested, that, an, infant, s, perception, and, understanding, of, the, world, depended, on, their, motor, development, which, was, required, for, the, infant, to, link, visual, tactile, and, motor, representations, of, objects, according, to, this, theory, infants, develop, object, permanence, through, touching, and, handling, objects, infants, start, to, understanding, that, objects, continue, to, exist, when, out, of, sight, piaget, s, sensorimotor, stage, comprised, six, sub, stages, see, sensorimotor, stages, for, more, detail, in, the, early, stages, development, arises, out, of, movements, caused, by, primitive, reflexes, discovery, of, new, behaviors, results, from, classical, and, operant, conditioning, and, the, formation, of, habits, from, eight, months, the, infant, is, able, to, uncover, a, hidden, object, but, will, persevere, when, the, object, is, moved, piaget, concluded, that, infants, lacked, object, permanence, before, 18, months, when, infants, before, this, age, failed, to, look, for, an, object, where, it, had, last, been, seen, instead, infants, continued, to, look, for, an, object, where, it, was, first, seen, committing, the, a, not, b, error, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, before, the, age, of, 8, 9, months, infants, inability, to, understand, object, permanence, extends, to, people, which, explains, why, infants, at, this, age, do, not, cry, when, their, mothers, are, gone, out, of, sight, out, of, mind, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, researchers, developed, new, methods, of, assessing, infants, understanding, of, the, world, with, far, more, precision, and, subtlety, than, piaget, was, able, to, do, in, his, time, since, then, many, studies, based, on, these, methods, suggest, that, young, infants, understand, far, more, about, the, world, than, first, thought, based, on, recent, findings, some, researchers, such, as, elizabeth, spelke, and, renee, baillargeon, have, proposed, that, an, understanding, of, object, permanence, is, not, learned, at, all, but, rather, comprises, part, of, the, innate, cognitive, capacities, of, our, species, according, to, jean, piaget, s, developmental, psychology, object, permanence, or, the, awareness, that, objects, exist, even, when, they, are, no, longer, visible, was, thought, to, emerge, gradually, between, the, ages, of, 8, and, 12, months, however, experts, such, as, elizabeth, spelke, and, renee, baillargeon, have, questioned, this, notion, they, studied, infants, comprehension, of, object, permanence, at, a, young, age, using, novel, experimental, approaches, such, as, violation, of, expectation, paradigms, these, findings, imply, that, children, as, young, as, 3, to, 4, months, old, may, have, an, innate, awareness, of, object, permanence, baillargeon, s, drawbridge, experiment, for, example, showed, that, infants, were, surprised, when, they, saw, occurrences, that, contradicted, object, permanence, expectations, this, proposition, has, important, consequences, for, our, understanding, of, infant, cognition, implying, that, infants, may, be, born, with, core, cognitive, abilities, rather, than, developing, them, via, experience, and, learning, other, research, has, suggested, that, young, infants, in, their, first, six, months, of, life, may, possess, an, understanding, of, numerous, aspects, of, the, world, around, them, including, there, are, critical, periods, in, infancy, and, childhood, during, which, development, of, certain, perceptual, sensorimotor, social, and, language, systems, depends, crucially, on, environmental, stimulation, feral, children, such, as, genie, deprived, of, adequate, stimulation, fail, to, acquire, important, skills, and, are, unable, to, learn, in, later, childhood, in, this, case, genie, is, used, to, represent, the, case, of, a, feral, child, because, she, was, socially, neglected, and, abused, while, she, was, just, a, young, girl, she, underwent, abnormal, child, psychology, which, involved, problems, with, her, linguistics, this, happened, because, she, was, neglected, while, she, was, very, young, with, no, one, to, care, about, her, and, had, less, human, contact, the, concept, of, critical, periods, is, also, well, established, in, neurophysiology, from, the, work, of, hubel, and, wiesel, among, others, neurophysiology, in, infants, generally, provides, correlating, details, that, exists, between, neurophysiological, details, and, clinical, features, and, also, focuses, on, vital, information, on, rare, and, common, neurological, disorders, that, affect, infants, studies, have, been, done, to, look, at, the, differences, in, children, who, have, developmental, delays, versus, typical, development, normally, when, being, compared, to, one, another, mental, age, ma, is, not, taken, into, consideration, there, still, may, be, differences, in, developmentally, delayed, dd, children, vs, typical, development, td, behavioral, emotional, and, other, mental, disorders, when, compared, to, ma, children, there, is, a, bigger, difference, between, normal, developmental, behaviors, overall, dds, can, cause, lower, ma, so, comparing, dds, with, tds, may, not, be, as, accurate, pairing, dds, specifically, with, td, children, at, similar, ma, can, be, more, accurate, there, are, levels, of, behavioral, differences, that, are, considered, as, normal, at, certain, ages, when, evaluating, dds, and, ma, in, children, consider, whether, those, with, dds, have, a, larger, amount, of, behavior, that, is, not, typical, for, their, ma, group, developmental, delays, tend, to, contribute, to, other, disorders, or, difficulties, than, their, td, counterparts, infants, shift, between, ages, of, one, and, two, to, a, developmental, stage, known, as, toddlerhood, in, this, stage, an, infant, s, transition, into, toddlerhood, is, highlighted, through, self, awareness, developing, maturity, in, language, use, and, presence, of, memory, and, imagination, during, toddlerhood, babies, begin, learning, how, to, walk, talk, and, make, decisions, for, themselves, an, important, characteristic, of, this, age, period, is, the, development, of, language, where, children, are, learning, how, to, communicate, and, express, their, emotions, and, desires, through, the, use, of, vocal, sounds, babbling, and, eventually, words, self, control, also, begins, to, develop, at, this, age, children, take, initiative, to, explore, experiment, and, learn, from, making, mistakes, caretakers, who, encourage, toddlers, to, try, new, things, and, test, their, limits, help, the, child, become, autonomous, self, reliant, and, confident, if, the, caretaker, is, overprotective, or, disapproving, of, independent, actions, the, toddler, may, begin, to, doubt, their, abilities, and, feel, ashamed, of, the, desire, for, independence, the, child, s, autonomic, development, is, inhibited, leaving, them, less, prepared, to, deal, with, the, world, in, the, future, toddlers, also, begin, to, identify, themselves, in, gender, roles, acting, according, to, their, perception, of, what, a, man, or, woman, should, do, socially, the, period, of, toddler, hood, is, commonly, called, the, terrible, twos, toddlers, often, use, their, new, found, language, abilities, to, voice, their, desires, but, are, often, misunderstood, by, parents, due, to, their, language, skills, just, beginning, to, develop, a, person, at, this, stage, testing, their, independence, is, another, reason, behind, the, stage, s, infamous, label, tantrums, in, a, fit, of, frustration, are, also, common, erik, erikson, divides, childhood, into, four, stages, each, with, its, distinct, social, crisis, infancy, as, stated, the, psychosocial, crisis, for, erikson, is, trust, versus, mistrust, needs, are, the, foundation, for, gaining, or, losing, trust, in, the, infant, if, the, needs, are, met, trust, in, the, guardian, and, the, world, forms, if, the, needs, are, not, met, or, the, infant, is, neglected, mistrust, forms, alongside, feelings, of, anxiety, and, fear, early, childhood, autonomy, versus, shame, follows, trust, in, infancy, the, child, begins, to, explore, their, world, in, this, stage, and, discovers, preferences, in, what, they, like, if, autonomy, is, allowed, the, child, grows, in, independence, and, their, abilities, if, freedom, of, exploration, is, hindered, it, leads, to, feelings, of, shame, and, low, self, esteem, play, or, preschool, ages, 3, 5, in, the, earliest, years, children, are, completely, dependent, on, the, care, of, others, therefore, they, develop, a, social, relationship, with, their, care, givers, and, later, with, family, members, during, their, preschool, years, 3, 5, they, enlarge, their, social, horizons, to, include, people, outside, the, family, preoperational, and, then, operational, thinking, develops, which, means, actions, are, reversible, and, egocentric, thought, diminishes, the, motor, skills, of, preschoolers, increase, so, they, can, do, more, things, for, themselves, they, become, more, independent, no, longer, completely, dependent, on, the, care, of, others, the, world, of, this, age, group, expands, more, people, have, a, role, in, shaping, their, individual, personalities, preschoolers, explore, and, question, their, world, for, jean, piaget, the, child, is, a, little, scientist, exploring, and, reflecting, on, these, explorations, to, increase, competence, and, this, is, done, in, a, very, independent, way, 7, 9, play, is, a, major, activity, for, ages, 3, 5, for, piaget, through, play, a, child, reaches, higher, levels, of, cognitive, development, 14, in, their, expanded, world, children, in, the, 3, 5, age, group, attempt, to, find, their, own, way, if, this, is, done, in, a, socially, acceptable, way, the, child, develops, the, initiative, if, not, the, child, develops, guilt, children, who, develop, guilt, rather, than, initiative, have, failed, erikson, s, psychosocial, crisis, for, the, 3, 5, age, group, middle, and, late, childhood, ages, 6, 12, for, erik, erikson, the, psychosocial, crisis, during, middle, childhood, is, industry, vs, inferiority, which, if, successfully, met, instills, a, sense, of, competency, in, the, child, in, all, cultures, middle, childhood, is, a, time, for, developing, skills, that, will, be, needed, in, their, society, school, offers, an, arena, in, which, children, can, gain, a, view, of, themselves, as, industrious, and, worthy, they, are, graded, for, their, school, work, and, often, for, their, industry, they, can, also, develop, industry, outside, of, school, in, sports, games, and, doing, volunteer, work, children, who, achieve, success, in, school, or, games, might, develop, a, feeling, of, competence, the, peril, during, this, period, is, that, feelings, of, inadequacy, and, inferiority, will, develop, parents, and, teachers, can, undermine, a, child, s, development, by, failing, to, recognize, accomplishments, or, being, overly, critical, of, a, child, s, efforts, children, who, are, encouraged, and, praised, develop, a, belief, in, their, competence, lack, of, encouragement, or, ability, to, excel, lead, to, feelings, of, inadequacy, and, inferiority, the, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, divides, middle, childhood, into, two, stages, 6, 8, years, and,

and, their, place, in, the, world, working, with, other, students, and, wanting, their, friendship, and, acceptance, become, more, important, this, leads, to, more, independence, from, parents, and, family, as, students, they, develop, the, mental, and, verbal, skills, to, describe, experiences, and, talk, about, thoughts, and, feelings, they, become, less, self, centered, and, show, more, concern, for, others, late, childhood, 9, 12, for, children, ages, 9, 11, friendships, and, peer, relationships, increase, in, strength, complexity, and, importance, this, results, in, greater, peer,

it, is, the, period, known, for, the, formation, of, personal, and, social, identity, see, erik, erikson, and, the, discovery, of, moral, purpose, see, william, damon, intelligence, is, demonstrated, through, the, logical, use, of, symbols, related, to, abstract, concepts, and, formal, reasoning, a, return, to, egocentric, thought, often, occurs, early, in, the, period, only, 35, develop, the, capacity, to, reason, formally, during, adolescence, or, adulthood, huitt, w, and, hummel, j, january, 1998, erik, erikson, labels, this, stage, identity, versus, role, confusion, erikson, emphasizes, the, importance, of, developing, a, sense, of, identity, in, adolescence, because, it, affects, the, individual, throughout, their, life, identity, is, a, lifelong, process, and, is, related, with, curiosity, and, active, engagement, role, confusion, is, often, considered, the, current, state, of, identity, of, the, individual, identity, exploration, is, the, process, of, changing, from, role, confusion, to, resolution, during, erik, erikson, s, identity, versus, role, uncertainty, stage, which, occurs, in, adolescence, people, struggle, to, form, a, cohesive, sense, of, self, while, exploring, many, social, roles, and, prospective, life, routes, this, time, is, characterized, by, deep, introspection, self, examination, and, the, pursuit, of, self, understanding, adolescents, are, confronted, with, questions, regarding, their, identity, beliefs, and, future, goals, the, major, problem, is, building, a, strong, sense, of, identity, in, the, face, of, society, standards, peer, pressure, and, personal, preferences, adolescents, participate, in, identity, exploration, commitment, and, synthesis, actively, seeking, out, new, experiences, embracing, ideals, and, aspirations, and, merging, their, changing, sense, of, self, into, a, coherent, identity, successfully, navigating, this, stage, builds, the, groundwork, for, good, psychological, development, in, adulthood, allowing, people, to, pursue, meaningful, relationships, make, positive, contributions, to, society, and, handle, life, s, adversities, with, perseverance, and, purpose, it, is, divided, into, three, parts, namely, the, adolescent, unconsciously, explores, questions, such, as, who, am, i, who, do, i, want, to, be, like, toddlers, adolescents, must, explore, test, limits, become, autonomous, and, commit, to, an, identity, or, sense, of, self, different, roles, behaviors, and, ideologies, must, be, tried, out, to, select, an, identity, role, confusion, and, inability, to, choose, vocation, can, result, from, a, failure, to, achieve, a, sense, of, identity, through, for, example, friends, early, adulthood, generally, refers, to, the, period, between, ages, 18, to, 39, and, according, to, theorists, such, as, erik, erikson, is, a, stage, where, development, is, mainly, focused, on, maintaining, relationships, erikson, shows, the, importance, of, relationships, by, labeling, this, stage, intimacy, vs, isolation, intimacy, suggests, a, process, of, becoming, part, of, something, larger, than, oneself, by, sacrificing, in, romantic, relationships, and, working, for, both, life, and, career, goals, other, examples, include, creating, bonds, of, intimacy, sustaining, friendships, and, starting, a, family, some, theorists, state, that, development, of, intimacy, skills, rely, on, the, resolution, of, previous, developmental, stages, a, sense, of, identity, gained, in, the, previous, stages, is, also, necessary, for, intimacy, to, develop, if, this, skill, is, not, learned, the, alternative, is, alienation, isolation, a, fear, of, commitment, and, the, inability, to, depend, on, others, isolation, on, the, other, hand, suggests, something, different, than, most, might, expect, erikson, defined, it, as, a, delay, of, commitment, in, order, to, maintain, freedom, yet, this, decision, does, not, come, without, consequences, erikson, explained, that, choosing, isolation, may, affect, one, s, chances, of, getting, married, progressing, in, a, career, and, overall, development, a, related, framework, for, studying, this, part, of, the, lifespan, is, that, of, emerging, adulthood, scholars, of, emerging, adulthood, such, as, jeffrey, arnett, are, not, necessarily, interested, in, relationship, development, instead, this, concept, suggests, that, people, transition, after, their, teenage, years, into, a, period, not, characterized, as, relationship, building, and, an, overall, sense, of, constancy, with, life, but, with, years, of, living, with, parents, phases, of, self, discovery, and, experimentation, middle, adulthood, generally, refers, to, the, period, between, ages, 40, to, 64, during, this, period, middle, aged, adults, experience, a, conflict, between, generativity, and, stagnation, generativity, is, the, sense, of, contributing, to, society, the, next, generation, or, their, immediate, community, on, the, other, hand, stagnation, results, in, a, lack, of, purpose, the, adult, s, identity, continues, to, develop, in, middle, adulthood, middle, aged, adults, often, adopt, opposite, gender, characeristics, the, adult, realizes, they, are, half, way, through, their, life, and, often, reevaluate, vocational, and, social, roles, life, circumstances, can, also, cause, a, reexamination, of, identity, physically, the, middle, aged, experience, a, decline, in, muscular, strength, reaction, time, sensory, keenness, and, cardiac, output, also, women, experience, menopause, at, an, average, age, of, 48, 8, and, a, sharp, drop, in, the, hormone, estrogen, men, experience, an, equivalent, endocrine, system, event, to, menopause, andropause, in, males, is, a, hormone, fluctuation, with, physical, and, psychological, effects, that, can, be, similar, to, those, seen, in, menopausal, females, as, men, age, lowered, testosterone, levels, can, contribute, to, mood, swings, and, a, decline, in, sperm, count, sexual, responsiveness, can, also, be, affected, including, delays, in, erection, and, longer, periods, of, penile, stimulation, required, to, achieve, ejaculation, the, important, influence, of, biological, and, social, changes, experienced, by, women, and, men, in, middle, adulthood, is, reflected, in, the, fact, that, depression, is, highest, at, age, 48, 5, around, the, world, the, world, health, organization, finds, no, general, agreement, on, the, age, at, which, a, person, becomes, old, most, developed, countries, set, the, age, as, 65, or, 70, however, in, developing, countries, inability, to, make, active, contribution, to, society, not, chronological, age, marks, the, beginning, of, old, age, according, to, erikson, s, stages, of, psychosocial, development, old, age, is, the, stage, in, which, individuals, assess, the, quality, of, their, lives, erikson, labels, this, stage, as, integrity, versus, despair, for, integrated, persons, there, is, a, sense, of, fulfillment, in, life, they, have, become, self, aware, and, optimistic, due, to, life, s, commitments, and, connection, to, others, while, reflecting, on, life, people, in, this, stage, develop, feelings, of, contentment, with, their, experiences, if, a, person, falls, into, despair, they, are, often, disappointed, about, failures, or, missed, chances, in, life, they, may, feel, that, the, time, left, in, life, is, an, insufficient, amount, to, turn, things, around, physically, older, people, experience, a, decline, in, muscular, strength, reaction, time, stamina, hearing, distance, perception, and, the, sense, of, smell, they, also, are, more, susceptible, to, diseases, such, as, cancer, and, pneumonia, due, to, a, weakened, immune, system, programs, aimed, at, balance, muscle, strength, and, mobility, have, been, shown, to, reduce, disability, among, mildly, but, not, more, severely, disabled, elderly, sexual, expression, depends, in, large, part, upon, the, emotional, and, physical, health, of, the, individual, many, older, adults, continue, to, be, sexually, active, and, satisfied, with, their, sexual, activity, mental, disintegration, may, also, occur, leading, to, dementia, or, ailments, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, the, average, age, of, onset, for, dementia, in, males, is, 78, 8, and, 81, 9, for, women, it, is, generally, believed, that, crystallized, intelligence, increases, up, to, old, age, while, fluid, intelligence, decreases, with, age, whether, or, not, normal, intelligence, increases, or, decreases, with, age, depends, on, the, measure, and, study, longitudinal, studies, show, that, perceptual, speed, inductive, reasoning, and, spatial, orientation, decline, an, article, on, adult, cognitive, development, reports, that, cross, sectional, studies, show, that, some, abilities, remained, stable, into, early, old, age, parenting, variables, alone, have, typically, accounted, for, 20, to, 50, percent, of, the, variance, in, child, outcomes, all, parents, have, their, own, parenting, styles, parenting, styles, according, to, kimberly, kopko, are, based, upon, two, aspects, of, parenting, behavior, control, and, warmth, parental, control, refers, to, the, degree, to, which, parents, manage, their, children, s, behavior, parental, warmth, refers, to, the, degree, to, which, parents, are, accepting, and, responsive, to, their, children, s, behavior, the, following, parenting, styles, have, been, described, in, the, child, development, literature, parenting, roles, in, child, development, have, typically, focused, on, the, role, of, the, mother, recent, literature, however, has, looked, toward, the, father, as, having, an, important, role, in, child, development, affirming, a, role, for, fathers, studies, have, shown, that, children, as, young, as, 15, months, benefit, significantly, from, substantial, engagement, with, their, father, in, particular, a, study, in, the, u, s, and, new, zealand, found, the, presence, of, the, natural, father, was, the, most, significant, factor, in, reducing, rates, of, early, sexual, activity, and, rates, of, teenage, pregnancy, in, girls, furthermore, another, argument, is, that, neither, a, mother, nor, a, father, is, actually, essential, in, successful, parenting, and, that, single, parents, as, well, as, homosexual, couples, can, support, positive, child, outcomes, according, to, this, set, of, research, children, need, at, least, one, consistently, responsible, adult, with, whom, the, child, can, have, a, positive, emotional, connection, having, more, than, one, of, these, figures, contributes, to, a, higher, likelihood, of, positive, child, outcomes, another, parental, factor, often, debated, in, terms, of, its, effects, on, child, development, is, divorce, divorce, in, itself, is, not, a, determining, factor, of, negative, child, outcomes, in, fact, the, majority, of, children, from, divorcing, families, fall, into, the, normal, range, on, measures, of, psychological, and, cognitive, functioning, a, number, of, mediating, factors, play, a, role, in, determining, the, effects, divorce, has, on, a, child, for, example, divorcing, families, with, young, children, often, face, harsher, consequences, in, terms, of, demographic, social, and, economic, changes, than, do, families, with, older, children, positive, coparenting, after, divorce, is, part, of, a, pattern, associated, with, positive, child, coping, while, hostile, parenting, behaviors, lead, to, a, destructive, pattern, leaving, children, at, risk, additionally, direct, parental, relationship, with, the, child, also, affects, the, development, of, a, child, after, a, divorce, overall, protective, factors, facilitating, positive, child, development, after, a, divorce, are, maternal, warmth, positive, father, child, relationship, and, cooperation, between, parents, a, way, to, improve, developmental, psychology, is, a, representation, of, cross, cultural, studies, the, psychology, field, in, general, assumes, that, basic, human, developments, are, represented, in, any, population, specifically, the, western, educated, industrialized, rich, and, democratic, w, e, i, r, d, subjects, that, are, relied, on, for, a, majority, of, their, studies, previous, research, generalizes, the, findings, done, with, w, e, i, r, d, samples, because, many, in, the, psychological, field, assume, certain, aspects, of, development, are, exempted, from, or, are, not, affected, by, life, experiences, however, many, of, the, assumptions, have, been, proven, incorrect, or, are, not, supported, by, empirical, research, for, example, according, to, kohlberg, moral, reasoning, is, dependent, on, cognitive, abilities, while, both, analytical, and, holistic, cognitive, systems, do, have, the, potential, to, develop, in, any, adult, the, west, is, still, on, the, extreme, end, of, analytical, thinking, and, the, non, west, tend, to, use, holistic, processes, furthermore, moral, reasoning, in, the, west, only, considers, aspects, that, support, autonomy, and, the, individual, whereas, non, western, adults, emphasize, moral, behaviors, supporting, the, community, and, maintaining, an, image, of, holiness, or, divinity, not, all, aspects, of, human, development, are, universal, and, we, can, learn, a, lot, from, observing, different, regions, and, subjects, an, example, of, a, non, western, model, for, development, stages, is, the, indian, model, focusing, a, large, amount, of, its, psychological, research, on, morality, and, interpersonal, progress, the, developmental, stages, in, indian, models, are, founded, by, hinduism, which, primarily, teaches, stages, of, life, in, the, process, of, someone, discovering, their, fate, or, dharma, this, cross, cultural, model, can, add, another, perspective, to, psychological, development, in, which, the, west, behavioral, sciences, have, not, emphasized, kinship, ethnicity, or, religion, indian, psychologists, study, the, relevance, of, attentive, families, during, the, early, stages, of, life, the, early, life, stages, conceptualize, a, different, parenting, style, from, the, west, because, it, does, not, try, to, rush, children, out, of, dependency, the, family, is, meant, to, help, the, child, grow, into, the, next, developmental, stage, at, a, particular, age, this, way, when, children, finally, integrate, into, society, they, are, interconnected, with, those, around, them, and, reach, renunciation, when, they, are, older, children, are, raised, in, joint, families, so, that, in, early, childhood, ages, 6, months, to, 2, years, the, other, family, members, help, gradually, wean, the, child, from, its, mother, during, ages, 2, to, 5, the, parents, do, not, rush, toilet, training, instead, of, training, the, child, to, perform, this, behavior, the, child, learns, to, do, it, as, they, mature, at, their, own, pace, this, model, of, early, human, development, encourages, dependency, unlike, western, models, that, value, autonomy, and, independence, by, being, attentive, and, not, forcing, the, child, to, become, independent, they, are, confident, and, have, a, sense, of, belonging, by, late, childhood, and, adolescence, this, stage, in, life, 5, 15, years, is, also, when, children, start, education, and, increase, their, knowledge, of, dharma, it, is, within, early, and, middle, adulthood, that, we, see, moral, development, progress, early, middle, and, late, adulthood, are, all, concerned, with, caring, for, others, and, fulfilling, dharma, the, main, distinction, between, early, adulthood, to, middle, or, late, adulthood, is, how, far, their, influence, reaches, early, adulthood, emphasizes, the, importance, of, fulfilling, the, immediate, family, needs, until, later, adulthood, when, they, broaden, their, responsibilities, to, the, general, public, the, old, age, life, stage, development, reaches, renunciation, or, a, complete, understanding, of, dharma, the, current, mainstream, views, in, the, psychological, field, are, against, the, indian, model, for, human, development, the, criticism, against, such, models, is, that, the, parenting, style, is, overly, protective, and, encourages, too, much, dependency, it, focuses, on, interpersonal, instead, of, individual, goals, also, there, are, some, overlaps, and, similarities, between, erikson, s, stages, of, human, development, and, the, indian, model, but, both, of, them, still, have, major, differences, the, west, prefers, erickson, s, ideas, over, the, indian, model, because, they, are, supported, by, scientific, studies, the, life, cycles, based, on, hinduism, are, not, as, favored, because, it, is, not, supported, with, research, and, it, focuses, on, the, ideal, human, development
