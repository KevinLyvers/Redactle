child, labour, is, the, exploitation, of, children, through, any, form, of, work, that, interferes, with, their, ability, to, attend, regular, school, or, is, mentally, physically, socially, and, morally, harmful, such, exploitation, is, prohibited, by, legislation, worldwide, although, these, laws, do, not, consider, all, work, by, children, as, child, labour, exceptions, include, work, by, child, artists, family, duties, supervised, training, and, some, forms, of, work, undertaken, by, amish, children, as, well, as, by, indigenous, children, in, the, americas, child, labour, has, existed, to, varying, extents, throughout, history, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, many, children, aged, 5, 14, from, poorer, families, worked, in, western, nations, and, their, colonies, alike, these, children, mainly, worked, in, agriculture, home, based, assembly, operations, factories, mining, and, services, such, as, news, boys, some, worked, night, shifts, lasting, 12, hours, with, the, rise, of, household, income, availability, of, schools, and, passage, of, child, labour, laws, the, incidence, rates, of, child, labour, fell, as, of, 2023, in, the, world, s, poorest, countries, around, one, in, five, children, are, engaged, in, child, labour, the, highest, number, of, whom, live, in, sub, saharan, africa, where, more, than, one, in, four, children, are, so, engaged, this, represents, a, decline, in, child, labour, over, the, preceding, half, decade, in, 2017, four, african, nations, mali, benin, chad, and, guinea, bissau, witnessed, over, 50, per, cent, of, children, aged, 5, 14, working, worldwide, agriculture, is, the, largest, employer, of, child, labour, the, vast, majority, of, child, labour, is, found, in, rural, settings, and, informal, urban, economies, children, are, predominantly, employed, by, their, parents, rather, than, factories, poverty, and, lack, of, schools, are, considered, the, primary, cause, of, child, labour, unicef, notes, that, boys, and, girls, are, equally, likely, to, be, involved, in, child, labour, but, in, different, roles, girls, being, substantially, more, likely, to, perform, unpaid, household, labour, globally, the, incidence, of, child, labour, decreased, from, 25, to, 10, between, 1960, and, 2003, according, to, the, world, bank, nevertheless, the, total, number, of, child, labourers, remains, high, with, unicef, and, ilo, acknowledging, an, estimated, 168, million, children, aged, 5, 17, worldwide, were, involved, in, child, labour, in, 2013, child, labour, forms, an, intrinsic, part, of, pre, industrial, economies, in, pre, industrial, societies, there, is, rarely, a, concept, of, childhood, in, the, modern, sense, children, often, begin, to, actively, participate, in, activities, such, as, child, rearing, hunting, and, farming, as, soon, as, they, are, competent, in, many, societies, children, as, young, as, 13, are, seen, as, adults, and, engage, in, the, same, activities, as, adults, the, work, of, children, was, important, in, pre, industrial, societies, as, children, needed, to, provide, their, labour, for, their, survival, and, that, of, their, group, pre, industrial, societies, were, characterised, by, low, productivity, and, short, life, expectancy, preventing, children, from, participating, in, productive, work, would, be, more, harmful, to, their, welfare, and, that, of, their, group, in, the, long, run, in, pre, industrial, societies, there, was, little, need, for, children, to, attend, school, this, is, especially, the, case, in, non, literate, societies, most, pre, industrial, skill, and, knowledge, were, amenable, to, being, passed, down, through, direct, mentoring, or, apprenticing, by, competent, adults, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, britain, in, the, late, 18th, century, there, was, a, rapid, increase, in, the, industrial, exploitation, of, labour, including, child, labour, industrial, cities, such, as, birmingham, manchester, and, liverpool, rapidly, grew, from, small, villages, into, large, cities, and, improving, child, mortality, rates, these, cities, drew, in, the, population, that, was, rapidly, growing, due, to, increased, agricultural, output, this, process, was, replicated, in, other, industrialising, countries, the, victorian, era, in, particular, became, notorious, for, the, conditions, under, which, children, were, employed, children, as, young, as, four, were, employed, in, production, factories, and, mines, working, long, hours, in, dangerous, often, fatal, working, conditions, in, coal, mines, children, would, crawl, through, tunnels, too, narrow, and, low, for, adults, children, also, worked, as, errand, boys, crossing, sweepers, shoe, blacks, or, selling, matches, flowers, and, other, cheap, goods, some, children, undertook, work, as, apprentices, to, respectable, trades, such, as, building, or, as, domestic, servants, there, were, over, 120, 000, domestic, servants, in, london, in, the, mid, 18th, century, working, hours, were, long, builders, worked, 64, hours, a, week, in, the, summer, and, 52, hours, in, winter, while, servants, worked, 80, hour, weeks, child, labour, played, an, important, role, in, the, industrial, revolution, from, its, outset, often, brought, about, by, economic, hardship, the, children, of, the, poor, were, expected, to, contribute, to, their, family, income, in, 19th, century, great, britain, one, third, of, poor, families, were, without, a, breadwinner, as, a, result, of, death, or, abandonment, obliging, many, children, to, work, from, a, young, age, in, england, and, scotland, in, 1788, two, thirds, of, the, workers, in, 143, water, powered, cotton, mills, were, described, as, children, a, high, number, of, children, also, worked, as, prostitutes, the, author, charles, dickens, worked, at, the, age, of, 12, in, a, blacking, factory, with, his, family, in, a, debtor, s, prison, child, wages, were, often, low, the, wages, were, as, little, as, 10, 20, of, an, adult, male, s, wage, karl, marx, was, an, outspoken, opponent, of, child, labour, saying, british, industries, could, but, live, by, sucking, blood, and, children, s, blood, too, and, that, u, s, capital, was, financed, by, the, capitalized, blood, of, children, letitia, elizabeth, landon, castigated, child, labour, in, her, 1835, poem, the, factory, portions, of, which, she, pointedly, included, in, her, 18th, birthday, tribute, to, princess, victoria, in, 1837, throughout, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, child, labour, began, to, decline, in, industrialised, societies, due, to, regulation, and, economic, factors, because, of, the, growth, of, trade, unions, the, regulation, of, child, labour, began, from, the, earliest, days, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, first, act, to, regulate, child, labour, in, britain, was, passed, in, 1803, as, early, as, 1802, and, 1819, factory, acts, were, passed, to, regulate, the, working, hours, of, workhouse, children, in, factories, and, cotton, mills, to, 12, hours, per, day, these, acts, were, largely, ineffective, and, after, radical, agitation, by, for, example, the, short, time, committees, in, 1831, a, royal, commission, recommended, in, 1833, that, children, aged, 11, 18, should, work, a, maximum, of, 12, hours, per, day, children, aged, 9, 11, a, maximum, of, eight, hours, and, children, under, the, age, of, nine, were, no, longer, permitted, to, work, this, act, however, only, applied, to, the, textile, industry, and, further, agitation, led, to, another, act, in, 1847, limiting, both, adults, and, children, to, 10, hour, working, days, lord, shaftesbury, was, an, outspoken, advocate, of, regulating, child, labour, as, technology, improved, and, proliferated, there, was, a, greater, need, for, educated, employees, this, saw, an, increase, in, schooling, with, the, eventual, introduction, of, compulsory, schooling, improved, technology, automation, and, further, legislation, significantly, reduced, child, labour, particularly, in, western, europe, and, the, u, s, in, the, early, 20th, century, thousands, of, boys, were, employed, in, glass, making, industries, glass, making, was, a, dangerous, and, tough, job, especially, without, the, current, technologies, the, process, of, making, glass, includes, intense, heat, to, melt, glass, 3, 133, f, 1, 723, c, when, the, boys, are, at, work, they, are, exposed, to, this, heat, this, could, cause, eye, trouble, lung, ailments, heat, exhaustion, cuts, and, burns, since, workers, were, paid, by, the, piece, they, had, to, work, productively, for, hours, without, a, break, since, furnaces, had, to, be, constantly, burning, there, were, night, shifts, from, 5, 00, pm, to, 3, 00, am, many, factory, owners, preferred, boys, under, 16, years, of, age, an, estimated, 1, 7, million, children, under, the, age, of, fifteen, were, employed, in, american, industry, by, 1900, in, 1910, over, 2, million, children, in, the, same, age, group, were, employed, in, the, united, states, this, included, children, who, rolled, cigarettes, engaged, in, factory, work, worked, as, bobbin, doffers, in, textile, mills, worked, in, coal, mines, and, were, employed, in, canneries, lewis, hine, s, photographs, of, child, labourers, in, the, 1910s, powerfully, evoked, the, plight, of, working, children, in, the, american, south, hine, took, these, photographs, between, 1908, and, 1917, as, the, staff, photographer, for, the, national, child, labor, committee, factories, and, mines, were, not, the, only, places, where, child, labour, was, prevalent, in, the, early, 20th, century, home, based, manufacturing, across, the, united, states, and, europe, employed, children, as, well, governments, and, reformers, argued, that, labour, in, factories, must, be, regulated, and, the, state, had, an, obligation, to, provide, welfare, for, poor, legislation, that, followed, had, the, effect, of, moving, work, out, of, factories, into, urban, homes, families, and, women, in, particular, preferred, it, because, it, allowed, them, to, generate, income, while, taking, care, of, household, duties, home, based, manufacturing, operations, were, active, year, round, families, willingly, deployed, their, children, in, these, income, generating, home, enterprises, in, many, cases, men, worked, from, home, in, france, over, 58, of, garment, workers, operated, out, of, their, homes, in, germany, the, number, of, full, time, home, operations, nearly, doubled, between, 1882, and, 1907, and, in, the, united, states, millions, of, families, operated, out, of, home, seven, days, a, week, year, round, to, produce, garments, shoes, artificial, flowers, feathers, match, boxes, toys, umbrellas, and, other, products, children, aged, 5, 14, worked, alongside, the, parents, home, based, operations, and, child, labour, in, australia, britain, austria, and, other, parts, of, the, world, was, common, rural, areas, similarly, saw, families, deploying, their, children, in, agriculture, in, 1946, frieda, s, miller, then, director, of, the, united, states, department, of, labor, told, the, international, labour, organization, ilo, that, these, home, based, operations, offered, low, wages, long, hours, child, labour, unhealthy, and, insanitary, working, conditions, child, labour, is, still, common, in, many, parts, of, the, world, estimates, for, child, labour, vary, it, ranges, between, 250, and, 304, million, if, children, aged, 5, 17, involved, in, any, economic, activity, are, counted, if, light, occasional, work, is, excluded, ilo, estimates, there, were, 153, million, child, labourers, aged, 5, 14, worldwide, in, 2008, this, is, about, 20, million, less, than, ilo, estimate, for, child, labourers, in, 2004, some, 60, per, cent, of, the, child, labour, was, involved, in, agricultural, activities, such, as, farming, dairy, fisheries, and, forestry, another, 25, of, child, labourers, were, in, service, activities, such, as, retail, hawking, goods, restaurants, load, and, transfer, of, goods, storage, picking, and, recycling, trash, polishing, shoes, domestic, help, and, other, services, the, remaining, 15, laboured, in, assembly, and, manufacturing, in, informal, economy, home, based, enterprises, factories, mines, packaging, salt, operating, machinery, and, such, operations, two, out, of, three, child, workers, work, alongside, their, parents, in, unpaid, family, work, situations, some, children, work, as, guides, for, tourists, sometimes, combined, with, bringing, in, business, for, shops, and, restaurants, child, labour, predominantly, occurs, in, the, rural, areas, 70, and, informal, urban, sector, 26, contrary, to, popular, belief, most, child, labourers, are, employed, by, their, parents, rather, than, in, manufacturing, or, formal, economy, children, who, work, for, pay, or, in, kind, compensation, are, usually, found, in, rural, settings, as, opposed, to, urban, centres, less, than, 3, of, child, labour, aged, 5, 14, across, the, world, work, outside, their, household, or, away, from, their, parents, child, labour, accounts, for, 22, of, the, workforce, in, asia, 32, in, africa, 17, in, latin, america, 1, in, the, us, canada, europe, and, other, wealthy, nations, the, proportion, of, child, labourers, varies, greatly, among, countries, and, even, regions, inside, those, countries, africa, has, the, highest, percentage, of, children, aged, 5, 17, employed, as, child, labour, and, a, total, of, over, 65, million, asia, with, its, larger, population, has, the, largest, number, of, children, employed, as, child, labour, at, about, 114, million, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, region, have, lower, overall, population, density, but, at, 14, million, child, labourers, has, high, incidence, rates, too, accurate, present, day, child, labour, information, is, difficult, to, obtain, because, of, disagreements, between, data, sources, as, to, what, constitutes, child, labour, in, some, countries, government, policy, contributes, to, this, difficulty, for, example, the, overall, extent, of, child, labour, in, china, is, unclear, due, to, the, government, categorising, child, labour, data, as, highly, secret, china, has, enacted, regulations, to, prevent, child, labour, still, the, practice, of, child, labour, is, reported, to, be, a, persistent, problem, within, china, generally, in, agriculture, and, low, skill, service, sectors, as, well, as, small, workshops, and, manufacturing, enterprises, in, 2014, the, u, s, department, of, labor, issued, a, list, of, goods, produced, by, child, labor, or, forced, labor, where, china, was, attributed, 12, goods, the, majority, of, which, were, produced, by, both, underage, children, and, indentured, labourers, the, report, listed, electronics, garments, toys, and, coal, among, other, goods, the, maplecroft, child, labour, index, 2012, survey, reports, that, 76, countries, pose, extreme, child, labour, complicity, risks, for, companies, operating, worldwide, the, ten, highest, risk, countries, in, 2012, ranked, in, decreasing, order, were, myanmar, north, korea, somalia, sudan, dr, congo, zimbabwe, afghanistan, burundi, pakistan, and, ethiopia, of, the, major, growth, economies, maplecroft, ranked, philippines, 25th, riskiest, india, 27th, china, 36th, vietnam, 37th, indonesia, 46th, and, brazil, 54th, all, of, them, rated, to, involve, extreme, risks, of, child, labour, uncertainties, to, corporations, seeking, to, invest, in, developing, world, and, import, products, from, emerging, markets, the, ilo, suggests, that, poverty, is, the, greatest, single, cause, behind, child, labour, for, impoverished, households, income, from, a, child, s, work, is, usually, crucial, for, his, or, her, own, survival, or, for, that, of, the, household, income, from, working, children, even, if, small, may, be, between, 25, and, 40, of, the, household, income, other, scholars, such, as, harsch, on, african, child, labour, and, edmonds, and, pavcnik, on, global, child, labour, have, reached, the, same, conclusion, lack, of, meaningful, alternatives, such, as, affordable, schools, and, quality, education, according, to, the, ilo, is, another, major, factor, driving, children, to, harmful, labour, children, work, because, they, have, nothing, better, to, do, many, communities, particularly, rural, areas, where, between, 60, and, 70, of, child, labour, is, prevalent, do, not, possess, adequate, school, facilities, even, when, schools, are, sometimes, available, they, are, too, far, away, difficult, to, reach, unaffordable, or, the, quality, of, education, is, so, poor, that, parents, wonder, if, going, to, school, is, really, worth, it, in, european, history, when, child, labour, was, common, as, well, as, in, contemporary, child, labour, of, modern, world, certain, cultural, beliefs, have, grounded, it, some, view, that, work, is, good, for, the, character, building, and, skill, development, of, children, in, many, cultures, particular, where, the, informal, economy, and, small, household, businesses, thrive, the, cultural, tradition, is, that, children, follow, in, their, parents, footsteps, child, labour, then, is, a, means, to, learn, and, practice, that, trade, from, a, very, early, age, similarly, in, many, cultures, the, education, of, girls, is, less, valued, or, girls, are, simply, not, expected, to, need, formal, schooling, and, these, girls, pushed, into, child, labour, such, as, providing, domestic, services, biggeri, and, mehrotra, have, studied, the, macroeconomic, factors, that, encourage, child, labour, they, focus, their, study, on, five, asian, nations, including, india, pakistan, indonesia, thailand, and, philippines, they, suggest, that, child, labour, is, a, serious, problem, in, all, five, but, it, is, not, a, new, problem, macroeconomic, causes, encouraged, widespread, child, labour, across, the, world, over, most, of, human, history, they, suggest, that, the, causes, for, child, labour, include, both, the, demand, and, the, supply, side, while, poverty, and, unavailability, of, good, schools, explain, the, child, labour, supply, side, they, suggest, that, the, growth, of, low, paying, informal, economy, rather, than, higher, paying, formal, economy, is, amongst, the, causes, of, the, demand, side, other, scholars, too, suggest, that, inflexible, labour, market, size, of, informal, economy, inability, of, industries, to, scale, up, and, lack, of, modern, manufacturing, technologies, are, major, macroeconomic, factors, affecting, demand, and, acceptability, of, child, labour, systematic, use, of, child, labour, was, commonplace, in, the, colonies, of, european, powers, between, 1650, and, 1950, in, africa, colonial, administrators, encouraged, traditional, kin, ordered, modes, of, production, that, is, hiring, a, household, for, work, not, just, the, adults, millions, of, children, worked, in, colonial, agricultural, plantations, mines, and, domestic, service, industries, sophisticated, schemes, were, promulgated, where, children, in, these, colonies, between, the, ages, of, 5, and, 14, were, hired, as, an, apprentice, without, pay, in, exchange, for, learning, a, craft, a, system, of, pauper, apprenticeship, came, into, practice, in, the, 19th, century, where, the, colonial, master, neither, needed, the, native, parents, nor, child, s, approval, to, assign, a, child, to, labour, away, from, parents, at, a, distant, farm, owned, by, a, different, colonial, master, other, schemes, included, earn, and, learn, programs, where, children, would, work, and, thereby, learn, britain, for, example, passed, a, law, the, so, called, masters, and, servants, act, of, 1899, followed, by, tax, and, pass, law, to, encourage, child, labour, in, colonies, particularly, in, africa, these, laws, offered, the, native, people, the, legal, ownership, to, some, of, the, native, land, in, exchange, for, making, labour, of, wife, and, children, available, to, colonial, government, s, needs, such, as, in, farms, and, as, picannins, beyond, laws, new, taxes, were, imposed, on, colonies, one, of, these, taxes, was, the, head, tax, in, the, british, and, french, colonial, empires, the, tax, was, imposed, on, everyone, older, than, 8, years, in, some, colonies, to, pay, these, taxes, and, cover, living, expenses, children, in, colonial, households, had, to, work, in, southeast, asian, colonies, such, as, hong, kong, child, labour, such, as, the, mui, tsai, was, rationalised, as, a, cultural, tradition, and, ignored, by, british, authorities, the, dutch, east, india, company, officials, rationalised, their, child, labour, abuses, with, it, is, a, way, to, save, these, children, from, a, worse, fate, christian, mission, schools, in, regions, stretching, from, zambia, to, nigeria, too, required, work, from, children, and, in, exchange, provided, religious, education, not, secular, education, elsewhere, the, canadian, dominion, statutes, in, form, of, so, called, breaches, of, contract, act, stipulated, jail, terms, for, uncooperative, child, workers, proposals, to, regulate, child, labour, began, as, early, as, 1786, children, working, at, a, young, age, has, been, a, consistent, theme, throughout, africa, many, children, began, first, working, in, the, home, to, help, their, parents, run, the, family, farm, children, in, africa, today, are, often, forced, into, exploitative, labour, due, to, family, debt, and, other, financial, factors, leading, to, ongoing, poverty, other, types, of, domestic, child, labour, include, working, in, commercial, plantations, begging, and, other, sales, such, as, boot, shining, in, total, there, is, an, estimated, five, million, children, who, are, currently, working, in, the, field, of, agriculture, which, steadily, increases, during, the, time, of, harvest, along, with, 30, of, children, who, are, picking, coffee, there, are, an, estimated, 25, 000, school, age, children, who, work, year, round, what, industries, children, work, in, depends, on, whether, they, grew, up, in, a, rural, area, or, an, urban, area, children, who, were, born, in, urban, areas, often, found, themselves, working, for, street, vendors, washing, cars, helping, in, construction, sites, weaving, clothing, and, sometimes, even, working, as, exotic, dancers, while, children, who, grew, up, in, rural, areas, would, work, on, farms, doing, physical, labour, working, with, animals, and, selling, crops, many, children, can, also, be, found, working, in, hazardous, environments, with, some, using, bare, hands, stones, and, hammers, to, take, apart, crt, based, televisions, and, computer, monitors, of, all, the, child, workers, the, most, serious, cases, involved, street, children, and, trafficked, children, due, to, the, physical, and, emotional, abuse, they, endured, by, their, employers, to, address, the, issue, of, child, labour, the, united, nations, conventions, on, the, rights, of, the, child, act, was, implemented, in, 1959, yet, due, to, poverty, lack, of, education, and, ignorance, the, legal, actions, were, not, are, not, wholly, enforced, or, accepted, in, africa, other, legal, factors, that, have, been, implemented, to, end, and, reduce, child, labour, includes, the, global, response, that, came, into, force, in, 1979, by, the, declaration, of, the, international, year, of, the, child, along, with, the, human, rights, committee, of, the, united, nations, these, two, declarations, worked, on, many, levels, to, eliminate, child, labour, although, many, actions, have, been, taken, to, end, this, epidemic, child, labour, in, africa, is, still, an, issue, today, due, to, the, unclear, definition, of, adolescence, and, how, much, time, is, needed, for, children, to, engage, in, activities, that, are, crucial, for, their, development, another, issue, that, often, comes, into, play, is, the, link, between, what, constitutes, as, child, labour, within, the, household, due, to, the, cultural, acceptance, of, children, helping, run, the, family, business, in, the, end, there, is, a, consistent, challenge, for, the, national, government, to, strengthen, its, grip, politically, on, child, labour, and, to, increase, education, and, awareness, on, the, issue, of, children, working, below, the, legal, age, limit, with, children, playing, an, important, role, in, the, african, economy, child, labour, still, plays, an, important, role, for, many, in, the, 20th, century, from, european, settlement, in, 1788, child, convicts, were, occasionally, sent, to, australia, where, they, were, made, to, work, child, labour, was, not, as, excessive, in, australia, as, in, britain, with, a, low, population, agricultural, productivity, was, higher, and, families, did, not, face, starvation, as, in, established, industrialised, countries, australia, also, did, not, have, significant, industry, until, the, later, part, of, the, 20th, century, when, child, labour, laws, and, compulsory, schooling, had, developed, under, the, influence, of, britain, from, the, 1870s, child, labour, was, restricted, by, compulsory, schooling, child, labour, laws, in, australia, differ, from, state, to, state, generally, children, are, allowed, to, work, at, any, age, but, restrictions, exist, for, children, under, 15, years, of, age, these, restrictions, apply, to, work, hours, and, the, type, of, work, that, children, can, perform, in, all, states, children, are, obliged, to, attend, school, until, a, minimum, leaving, age, 15, years, of, age, in, all, states, except, tasmania, and, queensland, where, the, leaving, age, is, 17, child, labour, has, been, a, consistent, struggle, for, children, in, brazil, ever, since, portuguese, colonisation, in, the, region, began, in, 1500, work, that, many, children, took, part, in, was, not, always, visible, legal, or, paid, free, or, slave, labour, was, a, common, occurrence, for, many, youths, and, was, a, part, of, their, everyday, lives, as, they, grew, into, adulthood, yet, due, to, there, being, no, clear, definition, of, how, to, classify, what, a, child, or, youth, is, there, has, been, little, historical, documentation, of, child, labour, during, the, colonial, period, due, to, this, lack, of, documentation, it, is, hard, to, determine, just, how, many, children, were, used, for, what, kinds, of, work, before, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, documentation, of, child, labour, in, brazil, occurred, during, the, time, of, indigenous, societies, and, slave, labour, where, it, was, found, that, children, were, forcibly, working, on, tasks, that, exceeded, their, emotional, and, physical, limits, armando, dias, for, example, died, in, november, 1913, whilst, still, very, young, a, victim, of, an, electric, shock, when, entering, the, textile, industry, where, he, worked, boys, and, girls, were, victims, of, industrial, accidents, on, a, daily, basis, in, brazil, the, minimum, working, age, has, been, identified, as, fourteen, due, to, constitutional, amendments, that, passed, in, 1934, 1937, and, 1946, yet, due, to, a, change, in, the, dictatorship, by, the, military, in, the, 1980s, the, minimum, age, restriction, was, reduced, to, twelve, but, was, reviewed, due, to, reports, of, dangerous, and, hazardous, working, conditions, in, 1988, this, led, to, the, minimum, age, being, raised, once, again, to, 14, another, set, of, restrictions, was, passed, in, 1998, that, restricted, the, kinds, of, work, youth, could, partake, in, such, as, work, that, was, considered, hazardous, like, running, construction, equipment, or, certain, kinds, of, factory, work, although, many, steps, were, taken, to, reduce, the, risk, and, occurrence, of, child, labour, there, is, still, a, high, number, of, children, and, adolescents, working, under, the, age, of, fourteen, in, brazil, it, was, not, until, recently, in, the, 1980s, that, it, was, discovered, that, almost, nine, million, children, in, brazil, were, working, illegally, and, not, partaking, in, traditional, childhood, activities, that, help, to, develop, important, life, experiences, brazilian, census, data, pnad, 1999, indicate, that, 2, 55, million, 10, to, 14, year, olds, were, illegally, holding, jobs, they, were, joined, by, 3, 7, million, 15, to, 17, year, olds, and, about, 375, 000, 5, to, 9, year, olds, due, to, the, raised, age, restriction, of, 14, at, least, half, of, the, recorded, young, workers, had, been, employed, illegally, which, led, to, many, not, being, protected, by, important, labour, laws, although, substantial, time, has, passed, since, the, time, of, regulated, child, labour, there, are, still, many, children, working, illegally, in, brazil, many, children, are, used, by, drug, cartels, to, sell, and, carry, drugs, guns, and, other, illegal, substances, because, of, their, perception, of, innocence, this, type, of, work, that, youth, are, taking, part, in, is, very, dangerous, due, to, the, physical, and, psychological, implications, that, come, with, these, jobs, yet, despite, the, hazards, that, come, with, working, with, drug, dealers, there, has, been, an, increase, in, this, area, of, employment, throughout, the, country, many, factors, played, a, role, in, britain, s, long, term, economic, growth, such, as, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, late, 1700s, and, the, prominent, presence, of, child, labour, during, the, industrial, age, children, who, worked, at, an, early, age, were, often, not, forced, but, did, so, because, they, needed, to, help, their, family, survive, financially, due, to, poor, employment, opportunities, for, many, parents, sending, their, children, to, work, on, farms, and, in, factories, was, a, way, to, help, feed, and, support, the, family, child, labour, first, started, to, occur, in, england, when, household, businesses, were, turned, into, local, labour, markets, that, mass, produced, the, once, homemade, goods, because, children, often, helped, produce, the, goods, out, of, their, homes, working, in, a, factory, to, make, those, same, goods, was, a, simple, change, for, many, of, these, youths, although, there, are, many, counts, of, children, under, the, age, of, ten, working, for, factories, the, majority, of, children, workers, were, between, the, ages, of, ten, and, fourteen, another, factor, that, influenced, child, labour, was, the, demographic, changes, that, occurred, in, the, eighteenth, century, by, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, 20, per, cent, of, the, population, was, made, up, of, children, between, the, ages, of, 5, and, 14, due, to, this, substantial, shift, in, available, workers, and, the, development, of, the, industrial, revolution, children, began, to, work, earlier, in, life, in, companies, outside, of, the, home, yet, even, though, there, was, an, increase, of, child, labour, in, factories, such, as, cotton, textiles, there, were, large, numbers, of, children, working, in, the, field, of, agriculture, and, domestic, production, with, such, a, high, percentage, of, children, working, the, rising, of, illiteracy, and, the, lack, of, a, formal, education, became, a, widespread, issue, for, many, children, who, worked, to, provide, for, their, families, due, to, this, problematic, trend, many, parents, developed, a, change, of, opinion, when, deciding, whether, or, not, to, send, their, children, to, work, other, factors, that, lead, to, the, decline, of, child, labour, included, financial, changes, in, the, economy, changes, in, the, development, of, technology, raised, wages, and, continuous, regulations, on, factory, legislation, in, 1933, britain, adopted, legislation, restricting, the, use, of, children, under, 14, in, employment, the, children, and, young, persons, act, 1933, defined, the, term, child, as, anyone, of, compulsory, school, age, age, sixteen, in, general, no, child, may, be, employed, under, the, age, of, fifteen, years, or, fourteen, years, for, light, work, significant, levels, of, child, labour, appear, to, be, found, in, cambodia, in, 1998, ilo, estimated, that, 24, 1, of, children, in, cambodia, aged, between, 10, and, 14, were, economically, active, many, of, these, children, work, long, hours, and, cambodia, human, development, report, 2000, reported, that, approximately, 65, 000, children, between, the, ages, of, 5, and, 13, worked, 25, hours, a, week, and, did, not, attend, school, there, are, also, many, initiative, and, policies, put, in, place, to, decrease, the, prevalence, of, child, labour, such, as, the, united, states, generalised, system, of, preferences, the, u, s, cambodia, textile, agreement, ilo, garment, sector, working, conditions, improvement, project, and, childwise, tourism, an, ecuadorean, study, published, in, 2006, found, child, labour, to, be, one, of, the, main, environmental, problems, affecting, children, s, health, it, reported, that, over, 800, 000, children, are, working, in, ecuador, where, they, are, exposed, to, heavy, metals, and, toxic, chemicals, and, are, subject, to, mental, and, physical, stress, and, the, insecurity, caused, by, being, at, risk, of, work, related, accidents, minors, performing, agricultural, work, along, with, their, parents, help, apply, pesticides, without, wearing, protective, equipment, in, 2015, the, country, of, india, is, home, to, the, largest, number, of, children, who, are, working, illegally, in, various, industrial, industries, agriculture, in, india, is, the, largest, sector, where, many, children, work, at, early, ages, to, help, support, their, family, many, of, these, children, are, forced, to, work, at, young, ages, due, to, many, family, factors, such, as, unemployment, large, families, poverty, and, lack, of, parental, education, this, is, often, the, major, cause, of, the, high, rate, of, child, labour, in, india, on, 23, june, 1757, the, english, east, india, company, defeated, siraj, ud, daula, the, nawab, of, bengal, in, the, battle, of, plassey, the, british, thus, became, masters, of, east, india, bengal, bihar, orissa, a, prosperous, region, with, a, flourishing, agriculture, industry, and, trade, this, led, to, many, children, being, forced, into, labour, due, to, the, increasing, need, of, cheap, labour, to, produce, large, numbers, of, goods, many, multinationals, often, employed, children, because, that, they, can, be, recruited, for, less, pay, and, have, more, endurance, to, utilise, in, factory, environments, another, reason, many, indian, children, were, hired, was, because, they, lack, knowledge, of, their, basic, rights, they, did, not, cause, trouble, or, complain, and, they, were, often, more, trustworthy, the, innocence, that, comes, with, childhood, was, utilised, to, make, a, profit, by, many, and, was, encouraged, by, the, need, for, family, income, a, variety, of, indian, social, scientists, as, well, as, the, non, governmental, organisations, ngos, have, done, extensive, research, on, the, numeric, figures, of, child, labour, found, in, india, and, determined, that, india, contributes, to, one, third, of, asia, s, child, labour, and, one, fourth, of, the, world, s, child, labour, due, to, many, children, being, illegally, employed, the, indian, government, began, to, take, extensive, actions, to, reduce, the, number, of, children, working, and, to, focus, on, the, importance, of, facilitating, the, proper, growth, and, development, of, children, international, influences, help, to, encourage, legal, actions, to, be, taken, in, india, such, as, the, geneva, declaration, of, the, right, of, children, act, was, passed, in, 1924, this, act, was, followed, by, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, 1948, to, which, incorporated, the, basic, human, rights, and, needs, of, children, for, proper, progression, and, growth, in, their, younger, years, these, international, acts, encouraged, major, changes, to, the, workforce, in, india, which, occurred, in, 1986, when, the, child, labour, prohibition, and, regulation, act, was, put, into, place, this, act, prohibited, hiring, children, younger, than, the, age, of, 14, and, from, working, in, hazardous, conditions, due, to, the, increase, of, regulations, and, legal, restrictions, on, child, labour, there, has, been, a, 64, per, cent, decline, in, child, labour, from, 1993, to, 2005, although, this, is, a, great, decrease, in, the, country, of, india, there, is, still, high, numbers, of, children, working, in, the, rural, areas, of, india, with, 85, per, cent, of, the, child, labour, occurring, in, rural, areas, and, 15, per, cent, occurring, in, urban, areas, there, are, still, substantial, areas, of, concern, in, the, country, of, india, india, has, legislation, since, 1986, which, allows, work, by, children, in, non, hazardous, industry, in, 2013, the, punjab, and, haryana, high, court, gave, a, landmark, order, that, directed, that, there, shall, be, a, total, ban, on, the, employment, of, children, up, to, the, age, of, 14, years, be, it, hazardous, or, non, hazardous, industries, however, the, court, ruled, that, a, child, can, work, with, his, or, her, family, in, family, based, trades, occupations, for, the, purpose, of, learning, a, new, trade, craftsmanship, or, vocation, the, phenomenon, of, children, labour, is, one, of, the, social, issues, of, iranian, society, which, has, taken, on, serious, and, diverse, dimensions, over, time, researches, and, official, and, unofficial, data, show, that, this, social, damage, is, more, common, in, big, cities, also, research, data, shows, that, most, of, the, working, children, in, tehran, province, are, related, to, afghan, children, who, have, immigrated, to, iran, legally, or, illegally, kameel, ahmady, a, social, researcher, and, winner, of, the, literature, and, humanities, award, from, the, world, peace, foundation, while, emphasizing, the, fact, that, most, of, the, children, labour, in, tehran, province, are, afghan, children, along, with, his, colleagues, believes, that, with, the, continuation, of, iran, s, economic, crisis, the, lack, of, proper, mechanisms, to, manage, and, control, the, phenomenon, and, absence, of, legal, working, visa, scheme, for, afghan, immigrants, have, caused, this, social, harm, to, spread, abdolreza, rahmani, fazli, the, minister, of, interior, at, the, time, in, august, 2019, while, analysing, and, describing, the, situation, of, working, children, in, tehran, said, reports, show, that, street, children, live, in, poor, conditions, and, are, exploited, one, thing, that, should, be, noted, is, that, up, to, 80, of, these, children, are, non, iranian, considering, that, some, of, these, children, were, afghan, nationals, we, have, raised, the, issue, with, the, embassy, of, this, country, if, other, institutions, cooperate, we, can, take, appropriate, measures, to, organise, street, children, but, if, they, do, not, cooperate, it, has, also, been, decided, to, issue, arrest, warrants, for, gangs, exploiting, children, with, the, cooperation, of, the, police, force, and, the, judicial, system, in, isfahan, province, the, iranian, department, of, state, welfare, behzisti, keeps, a, database, of, the, scanned, retina, irises, of, a, number, of, working, street, kids, and, have, put, child, friendly, measures, in, place, to, support, them, reduce, the, social, harm, from, their, presence, and, improve, their, quality, of, life, only, tehran, as, of, june, 2023, has, seventy, thousand, working, children, they, also, collect, recycles, as, of, july, 2023, 15, of, children, are, child, labour, 8, do, not, have, a, residence, 10, per, cent, of, children, are, not, in, school, in, post, colonial, ireland, the, rate, of, child, exploitation, was, extremely, high, as, children, were, used, as, farm, labourers, once, they, were, able, to, walk, these, children, were, never, paid, for, the, labour, that, they, carried, out, on, the, family, farm, children, were, wanted, and, desired, in, ireland, for, the, use, of, their, labour, on, the, family, farm, irish, parents, felt, that, it, was, the, children, s, duty, to, carry, out, chores, on, the, family, farm, though, banned, in, modern, japan, shonenko, child, labourers, were, a, feature, of, the, imperial, era, until, its, end, in, 1945, during, world, war, ii, labour, recruiting, efforts, targeted, youths, from, taiwan, formosa, then, a, japanese, territory, with, promises, of, educational, opportunity, though, the, target, of, 25, 000, recruits, was, never, reached, over, 8, 400, taiwanese, youths, aged, 12, to, 14, relocated, to, japan, to, help, manufacture, the, mitsubishi, j2m, raiden, aircraft, child, labour, existed, in, the, netherlands, up, to, and, through, the, industrial, revolution, laws, governing, child, labour, in, factories, were, first, passed, in, 1874, but, child, labour, on, farms, continued, to, be, the, norm, up, until, the, 20th, century, although, formally, banned, since, 1922, child, labour, was, widespread, in, the, soviet, union, mostly, in, the, form, of, mandatory, unpaid, work, by, schoolchildren, on, saturdays, and, holidays, the, students, were, used, as, a, cheap, unqualified, workforce, on, kolhoz, collective, farms, as, well, as, in, industry, and, forestry, the, practice, was, formally, called, work, education, from, the, 1950s, on, the, students, were, also, used, for, unpaid, work, at, schools, where, they, cleaned, and, performed, repairs, this, practice, has, continued, in, the, russian, federation, where, up, to, 21, days, of, the, summer, holidays, is, sometimes, set, aside, for, school, works, by, law, this, is, only, allowed, as, part, of, specialised, occupational, training, and, with, the, students, and, parents, permission, but, those, provisions, are, widely, ignored, in, 2012, there, was, an, accident, near, the, city, of, nalchik, where, a, car, killed, several, pupils, cleaning, up, a, highway, shoulder, during, their, holiday, work, as, well, as, their, teacher, who, was, supervising, them, out, of, former, soviet, union, republics, uzbekistan, continued, and, expanded, the, program, of, child, labour, on, industrial, scale, to, increase, profits, on, the, main, source, of, islam, karimov, s, income, cotton, harvesting, in, september, when, school, normally, starts, the, classes, are, suspended, and, children, are, sent, to, cotton, fields, for, work, where, they, are, assigned, daily, quotas, of, 20, to, 60, kg, of, raw, cotton, they, have, to, collect, this, process, is, repeated, in, spring, when, collected, cotton, needs, to, be, hoed, and, weeded, in, 2006, it, is, estimated, that, 2, 7, million, children, were, forced, to, work, this, way, as, in, many, other, countries, child, labour, in, switzerland, affected, among, the, so, called, kaminfegerkinder, chimney, sweep, children, and, children, working, p, e, in, spinning, mills, factories, and, in, agriculture, in, 19th, century, switzerland, but, also, to, the, 1960s, so, called, verdingkinder, literally, contract, children, or, indentured, child, laborers, were, children, who, were, taken, from, their, parents, often, due, to, poverty, or, moral, reasons, usually, mothers, being, unmarried, very, poor, citizens, of, gypsy, yeniche, origin, so, called, kinder, der, landstrasse, etc, and, sent, to, live, with, new, families, often, poor, farmers, who, needed, cheap, labour, there, were, even, verdingkinder, auctions, where, children, were, handed, over, to, the, farmer, asking, the, least, money, from, the, authorities, thus, securing, cheap, labour, for, his, farm, and, relieving, the, authority, from, the, financial, burden, of, looking, after, the, children, in, the, 1930s, 20, of, all, agricultural, labourers, in, the, canton, of, bern, were, children, below, the, age, of, 15, swiss, municipality, guardianship, authorities, acted, so, commonly, tolerated, by, federal, authorities, to, the, 1960s, not, all, of, them, of, course, but, usually, communities, affected, of, low, taxes, in, some, swiss, cantons, swiss, historian, marco, leuenberger, investigated, that, in, 1930, there, were, some, 35, 000, indentured, children, and, between, 1920, and, 1970, more, than, 100, 000, are, believed, to, have, been, placed, with, families, or, homes, 10, 000, verdingkinder, are, still, alive, therefore, the, so, called, wiedergutmachungsinitiative, was, started, in, april, 2014, in, april, 2014, the, collection, of, targeted, at, least, authenticated, 100, 000, signatures, of, swiss, citizens, has, started, and, still, have, to, be, collected, to, october, 2015, child, labour, laws, in, the, united, states, are, found, at, the, federal, and, state, levels, the, most, sweeping, federal, law, that, restricts, the, employment, and, abuse, of, child, workers, is, the, fair, labor, standards, act, flsa, child, labour, provisions, under, flsa, are, designed, to, protect, the, educational, opportunities, of, youth, and, prohibit, their, employment, in, jobs, that, are, detrimental, to, their, health, and, safety, flsa, restricts, the, hours, that, youth, under, 16, years, of, age, can, work, and, lists, hazardous, occupations, too, dangerous, for, young, workers, to, perform, under, the, flsa, for, non, agricultural, jobs, children, under, 14, may, not, be, employed, children, between, 14, and, 16, may, be, employed, in, allowed, occupations, during, limited, hours, and, children, between, 16, and, 17, may, be, employed, for, unlimited, hours, in, non, hazardous, occupations, a, number, of, exceptions, to, these, rules, exist, such, as, for, employment, by, parents, newspaper, delivery, and, child, actors, the, regulations, for, agricultural, employment, are, generally, less, strict, states, have, varying, laws, covering, youth, employment, each, state, has, minimum, requirements, such, as, earliest, age, a, child, may, begin, working, number, of, hours, a, child, is, allowed, to, be, working, during, the, day, number, of, hours, a, child, is, allowed, to, be, worked, during, the, week, the, united, states, department, of, labor, lists, the, minimum, requirements, for, agricultural, work, in, each, state, where, state, law, differs, from, federal, law, on, child, labour, the, law, with, the, more, rigorous, standard, applies, individual, states, have, a, wide, range, of, restrictions, on, labour, by, minors, often, requiring, work, permits, for, minors, who, are, still, enrolled, in, high, school, limiting, the, times, and, hours, that, minors, can, work, by, age, and, imposing, additional, safety, regulations, almost, every, country, in, the, world, has, laws, relating, to, and,

authorised, by, the, competent, authority, children, above, the, age, of, 13, may, perform, light, work, for, a, limited, number, of, hours, per, week, in, other, economic, activities, as, defined, at, the, discretion, of, each, country, additionally, the, european, law, exception, allows, children, aged, 14, years, or, over, to, work, as, part, of, a, work, training, scheme, the, eu, directive, clarified, that, these, exceptions, do, not, allow, child, labour, where, the, children, may, experience, harmful, exposure, to, dangerous, substances, nonetheless, many, children, under, the, age, of, 13, do, work, even, in, the, most, developed, countries, of, the, eu, for, instance, a, recent, study, showed, over, a, third, of, dutch, twelve, year, old, kids, had, a, job, the, most, common, being, babysitting, very, often, however, these, state, laws, were, not, enforced, federal, legislation, was, passed, in, 1916, and, again, in, 1919, but, both, laws, were, declared, unconstitutional, by, the, supreme, court, although, the, number, of, child, workers, declined, dramatically, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, it, was, not, until, the, fair, labor, standards, act, in, 1938, that, federal, regulation, of, child, labor, finally, became, a, reality, scholars, disagree, on, the, best, legal, course, forward, to, address, child, labour, some, suggest, the, need, for, laws, that, place, a, blanket, ban, on, any, work, by, children, less, than, 18, years, old, others, suggest, the, current, international, laws, are, enough, and, the, need, for, more, engaging, approach, to, achieve, the, ultimate, goals, some, scholars, suggest, any, labour, by, children, aged, 18, years, or, less, is, wrong, since, this, encourages, illiteracy, inhumane, work, and, lower, investment, in, human, capital, these, activists, claim, that, child, labour, also, leads, to, poor, labour, standards, for, adults, depresses, the, wages, of, adults, in, developing, countries, as, well, as, the, developed, countries, and, dooms, the, third, world, economies, to, low, skill, jobs, only, capable, of, producing, poor, quality, cheap, exports, more, children, that, work, in, poor, countries, the, fewer, and, worse, paid, are, the, jobs, for, adults, in, these, countries, in, other, words, there, are, moral, and, economic, reasons, that, justify, a, blanket, ban, on, labour, from, children, aged, 18, years, or, less, everywhere, in, the, world, other, scholars, suggest, that, these, arguments, are, flawed, and, ignore, history, and, that, more, laws, will, do, more, harm, than, good, according, to, them, child, labour, is, merely, the, symptom, of, poverty, if, laws, ban, all, lawful, work, that, enables, the, poor, to, survive, informal, economy, illicit, operations, and, underground, businesses, will, thrive, these, will, increase, abuse, of, the, children, in, poor, countries, with, very, high, incidence, rates, of, child, labour, such, as, ethiopia, chad, niger, and, nepal, schools, are, not, available, and, the, few, schools, that, exist, offer, poor, quality, education, or, are, unaffordable, the, alternatives, for, children, who, currently, work, claim, these, studies, are, worse, grinding, subsistence, farming, militia, or, prostitution, child, labour, is, not, a, choice, it, is, a, necessity, the, only, option, for, survival, it, is, currently, the, least, undesirable, of, a, set, of, very, bad, choices, traidcraft, exchange, and, homeworkers, worldwide, argue, that, attempts, to, eliminate, child, labour, without, addressing, the, level, of, adult, earnings, may, lead, to, children, being, engaged, in, labour, in, less, visible, and, more, hazardous, occupations, these, scholars, suggest, from, their, studies, of, economic, and, social, data, that, early, 20th, century, child, labour, in, europe, and, the, united, states, ended, in, large, part, as, a, result, of, the, economic, development, of, the, formal, regulated, economy, technology, development, and, general, prosperity, child, labour, laws, and, ilo, conventions, came, later, edmonds, suggests, even, in, contemporary, times, the, incidence, of, child, labour, in, vietnam, has, rapidly, reduced, following, economic, reforms, and, gdp, growth, these, scholars, suggest, economic, engagement, emphasis, on, opening, quality, schools, rather, than, more, laws, and, expanding, economically, relevant, skill, development, opportunities, in, the, third, world, international, legal, actions, such, as, trade, sanctions, increase, child, labour, the, incredible, bread, machine, a, book, published, by, world, research, inc, in, 1974, stated, child, labour, was, a, particular, target, of, early, reformers, william, cooke, tatlor, wrote, at, the, time, about, these, reformers, who, witnessing, children, at, work, in, the, factories, thought, to, themselves, how, much, more, delightful, would, have, been, the, gambol, of, the, free, limbs, on, the, hillside, the, sight, of, the, green, mead, with, its, spangles, of, buttercups, and, daisies, the, song, of, the, bird, and, the, humming, bee, but, for, many, of, these, children, the, factory, system, meant, quite, literally, the, only, chance, for, survival, today, we, overlook, the, fact, that, death, from, starvation, and, exposure, was, a, common, fate, before, the, industrial, revolution, for, the, pre, capitalist, economy, was, barely, able, to, support, the, population, yes, children, were, working, formerly, they, would, have, starved, it, was, only, as, goods, were, produced, in, greater, abundance, at, a, lower, cost, that, men, could, support, their, families, without, sending, their, children, to, work, it, was, not, the, reformer, or, the, politician, that, ended, the, grim, necessity, for, child, labour, it, was, capitalism, in, 1998, unicef, reported, that, ivory, coast, farmers, used, enslaved, children, many, from, surrounding, countries, in, late, 2000, a, bbc, documentary, reported, the, use, of, enslaved, children, in, the, production, of, cocoa, the, main, ingredient, in, chocolate, in, west, africa, other, media, followed, by, reporting, widespread, child, slavery, and, child, trafficking, in, the, production, of, cocoa, in, 2001, the, us, state, department, estimated, there, were, 15, 000, child, slaves, cocoa, cotton, and, coffee, farms, in, the, ivory, coast, and, the, chocolate, manufacturers, association, acknowledged, that, child, slavery, is, used, in, the, cocoa, harvest, malian, migrants, have, long, worked, on, cocoa, farms, in, the, ivory, coast, but, in, 2000, cocoa, prices, had, dropped, to, a, 10, year, low, and, some, farmers, stopped, paying, their, employees, the, malian, counsel, had, to, rescue, some, boys, who, had, not, been, paid, for, five, years, and, who, were, beaten, if, they, tried, to, run, away, malian, officials, believed, that, 15, 000, children, some, as, young, as, 11, years, old, were, working, in, the, ivory, coast, in, 2001, these, children, were, often, from, poor, families, or, the, slums, and, were, sold, to, work, in, other, countries, parents, were, told, the, children, would, find, work, and, send, money, home, but, once, the, children, left, home, they, often, worked, in, conditions, resembling, slavery, in, other, cases, children, begging, for, food, were, lured, from, bus, stations, and, sold, as, slaves, in, 2002, the, ivory, coast, had, 12, 000, children, with, no, relatives, nearby, which, suggested, they, were, trafficked, likely, from, neighboring, mali, burkina, faso, and, togo, the, cocoa, industry, was, accused, of, profiting, from, child, slavery, and, trafficking, the, european, cocoa, association, dismissed, these, accusations, as, false, and, excessive, and, the, industry, said, the, reports, were, not, representative, of, all, areas, later, the, industry, acknowledged, the, working, conditions, for, children, were, unsatisfactory, and, children, s, rights, were, sometimes, violated, and, acknowledged, the, claims, could, not, be, ignored, in, a, bbc, interview, the, ambassador, for, ivory, coast, to, the, united, kingdom, called, these, reports, of, widespread, use, of, slave, child, labour, by, 700, 000, cocoa, farmers, as, absurd, and, inaccurate, in, 2001, a, voluntary, agreement, called, the, harkin, engel, protocol, was, accepted, by, the, international, cocoa, and, chocolate, industry, to, eliminate, the, worst, forms, of, child, labour, as, defined, by, ilo, s, convention, 182, in, west, africa, this, agreement, created, a, foundation, named, international, cocoa, initiative, in, 2002, the, foundation, claims, it, has, as, of, 2011, active, programs, in, 290, cocoa, growing, communities, in, c, te, d, ivoire,

these, children, hrw, claimed, were, bonded, child, labour, in, india, easy, to, find, in, karnataka, uttar, pradesh, and, tamil, nadu, in, 2010, a, german, news, investigative, report, claimed, that, non, governmental, organisations, ngos, had, found, up, to, 10, 000, children, working, in, the, 1, 000, silk, factories, in, 1998, in, other, locations, thousands, of, bonded, child, labourers, were, present, in, 1994, after, unicef, and, ngos, got, involved, the, child, labour, figure, dropped, drastically, after, 2005, with, the, total, estimated, to, be, fewer, than, a, thousand, child, labourers, the, report, claims, the, released, children, were, back, in, school, in, 2008, the, bbc, reported, that, the, company, primark, was, using, child, labour, in, the, manufacture, of, clothing, in, particular, a, 4, hand, embroidered, shirt, was, the, starting, point, of, a, documentary, produced, by, bbc, s, panorama, programme, the, programme, asks, consumers, to, ask, themselves, why, am, i, only, paying, 4, for, a, hand, embroidered, top, this, item, looks, handmade, who, made, it, for, such, little, cost, in, addition, to, exposing, the, violent, side, of, the, child, labour, industry, in, countries, where, child, exploitation, is, prevalent, as, a, result, of, the, bbc, report, royal, television, society, awarded, it, a, prize, and, primark, took, immediate, action, and, fired, three, indian, suppliers, in, 2008, primark, continued, to, investigate, the, allegations, for, three, years, concluding, that, bbc, report, was, a, fake, in, 2011, following, an, investigation, by, the, bbc, trust, s, editorial, standards, committee, the, bbc, announced, having, carefully, scrutinised, all, of, the, relevant, evidence, the, committee, concluded, that, on, the, balance, of, probabilities, it, was, more, likely, than, not, that, the, bangalore, footage, was, not, authentic, bbc, subsequently, apologised, for, faking, footage, and, returned, the, television, award, for, investigative, reporting, concerns, have, often, been, raised, over, the, buying, public, s, moral, complicity, in, purchasing, products, assembled, or, otherwise, manufactured, in, developing, countries, with, child, labour, however, others, have, raised, concerns, that, boycotting, products, manufactured, through, child, labour, may, force, these, children, to, turn, to, more, dangerous, or, strenuous, professions, such, as, prostitution, or, agriculture, for, example, a, unicef, study, found, that, after, the, child, labor, deterrence, act, was, introduced, in, the, us, an, estimated, 50, 000, children, were, dismissed, from, their, garment, industry, jobs, in, bangladesh, leaving, many, to, resort, to, jobs, such, as, stone, crushing, street, hustling, and, prostitution, jobs, that, are, more, hazardous, and, exploitative, than, garment, production, the, study, suggests, that, boycotts, are, blunt, instruments, with, long, term, consequences, that, can, actually, harm, rather, than, help, the, children, involved, according, to, milton, friedman, before, the, industrial, revolution, virtually, all, children, worked, in, agriculture, during, the, industrial, revolution, many, of, these, children, moved, from, farm, work, to, factory, work, over, time, as, real, wages, rose, parents, became, able, to, afford, to, send, their, children, to, school, instead, of, work, and, as, a, result, child, labour, declined, both, before, and, after, legislation, british, historian, and, socialist, e, p, thompson, in, the, making, of, the, english, working, class, draws, a, qualitative, distinction, between, child, domestic, work, and, participation, in, the, wider, waged, labour, market, further, the, usefulness, of, the, experience, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, making, predictions, about, current, trends, has, been, disputed, social, historian, hugh, cunningham, author, of, children, and, childhood, in, western, society, since, 1500, notes, that, fifty, years, ago, it, might, have, been, assumed, that, just, as, child, labour, had, declined, in, the, developed, world, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, so, it, would, also, in, a, trickle, down, fashion, in, the, rest, of, the, world, its, failure, to, do, that, and, its, re, emergence, in, the, developed, world, raise, questions, about, its, role, in, any, economy, whether, national, or, global, according, to, thomas, degregori, an, economics, professor, at, the, university, of, houston, in, an, article, published, by, the, cato, institute, a, libertarian, think, tank, operating, in, washington, d, c, it, is, clear, that, technological, and, economic, change, are, vital, ingredients, in, getting, children, out, of, the, workplace, and, into, schools, then, they, can, grow, to, become, productive, adults, and, live, longer, healthier, lives, however, in, poor, countries, like, bangladesh, working, children, are, essential, for, survival, in, many, families, as, they, were, in, our, own, heritage, until, the, late, 19th, century, so, while, the, struggle, to, end, child, labour, is, necessary, getting, there, often, requires, taking, different, routes, and, sadly, there, are, many, political, obstacles, the, international, programme, on, the, elimination, of, child, labour, ipec, founded, in, 1992, aims, to, eliminate, child, labour, it, operates, in, 88, countries, and, is, the, largest, program, of, its, kind, in, the, world, ipec, works, with, international, and, government, agencies, ngos, the, media, and, children, and, their, families, to, end, child, labour, and, provide, children, with, education, and, assistance, from, 2008, to, 2013, the, ilo, operated, a, program, through, ipec, entitled, combating, abusive, child, labour, cacl, ii, the, project, funded, by, the, european, union, contributed, to, the, government, of, pakistan, by, providing, alternative, opportunities, for, vocational, training, and, education, to, children, withdrawn, from, the, worst, forms, of, child, labour, periodically, governments, employers, and, workers, organisations, have, met, in, global, conference, to, assess, progress, and, remaining, obstacles, and, to, agree, measures, to, eliminate, the, worst, forms, of, child, labour, by, 2016, first, in, oslo, 1997, followed, by, the, hague, 2010, bras, lia, 8, 10, october, 2013, buenos, aires, 14, 16, november, 2017, and, most, recently, durban, south, africa, 15, 20, may, 2022, between, 2000, and, 2012, progress, was, made, against, child, labour, but, the, elimination, of, its, worst, forms, was, not, accomplished, under, the, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, of, the, 2030, agenda, un, member, states, employers, and, workers, organisations, and, civil, society, organisations, are, required, to, work, together, to, eliminate, child, labour, by, 2025, forced, labour, modern, slavery, and, human, trafficking, by, 2030, thus, the, ilo, established, alliance, 8, 7, as, a, global, partnership, in, january, 2021, the, ilo, published, the, child, labour, global, estimates, 2020, in, collaboration, with, unicef, according, to, the, report, child, labour, decreased, by, 38, from, 246, million, in, 2000, to, 152, million, in, 2016, due, to, covid, 19, pandemic, the, number, of, children, in, child, labour, increased, by, 9, million, the, term, child, labour, can, be, misleading, when, it, confuses, harmful, work, with, employment, that, may, be, beneficial, to, children, it, can, also, ignore, harmful, work, outside, employment, and, any, benefits, children, normally, derive, from, their, work, domestic, work, is, an, example, all, families, but, the, rich, must, work, at, cleaning, cooking, caring, and, more, to, maintain, their, homes, in, most, families, in, the, world, this, process, extends, to, productive, activities, especially, herding, and, various, types, of, agriculture, and, to, a, variety, of, small, family, businesses, where, trading, is, a, significant, feature, of, social, life, children, can, start, trading, in, small, items, at, an, early, age, often, in, the, company, of, family, members, or, of, peers, work, is, undertaken, from, an, early, age, by, vast, numbers, of, children, in, the, world, and, may, have, a, natural, place, in, growing, up, work, can, contribute, to, the, well, being, of, children, in, a, variety, of, ways, children, often, choose, to, work, to, improve, their, lives, both, in, the, short, and, long, term, at, the, material, level, children, s, work, often, contributes, to, producing, food, or, earning, income, that, benefits, themselves, and, their, families, and, such, income, is, especially, important, when, the, families, are, poor, work, can, provide, an, escape, from, debilitating, poverty, sometimes, by, allowing, a, young, person, to, move, away, from, an, impoverished, environment, young, people, often, enjoy, their, work, especially, paid, work, or, when, work, involves, the, company, of, peers, even, when, work, is, intensive, and, enforced, children, often, find, ways, to, combine, their, work, with, play, while, full, time, work, hinders, schooling, empirical, evidence, is, varied, on, the, relationship, between, part, time, work, and, school, sometimes, even, part, time, work, may, hinder, school, attendance, or, performance, on, the, other, hand, many, poor, children, work, for, resources, to, attend, school, children, who, are, not, doing, well, at, school, sometimes, seek, more,
