dialect, from, latin, dialectus, dialectos, from, the, ancient, greek, word, di, lektos, discourse, from, di, through, and, l, g, i, speak, refers, to, two, distinctly, different, types, of, linguistic, relationships, the, more, common, usage, of, the, term, in, english, refers, to, a, variety, of, a, language, that, is, a, characteristic, of, a, particular, group, of, the, language, s, speakers, the, dialects, or, varieties, of, a, particular, language, are, closely, related, and, despite, their, differences, are, most, often, largely, mutually, intelligible, especially, if, geographically, close, to, one, another, in, a, dialect, continuum, the, term, is, applied, most, often, to, regional, speech, patterns, but, a, dialect, may, also, be, defined, by, other, factors, such, as, social, class, or, ethnicity, a, dialect, that, is, associated, with, a, particular, social, class, can, be, termed, a, sociolect, a, dialect, that, is, associated, with, a, particular, ethnic, group, can, be, termed, an, ethnolect, and, a, geographical, regional, dialect, may, be, termed, a, regiolect, alternative, terms, include, regionalect, geolect, and, topolect, any, variety, of, a, given, language, can, be, classified, as, a, dialect, including, any, standardized, varieties, the, other, usage, which, refers, to, colloquial, settings, typically, diglossic, in, a, few, countries, like, italy, such, as, dialetto, patois, in, france, much, of, east, central, europe, and, the, philippines, may, carry, a, pejorative, undertone, and, underlines, the, politically, and, socially, subordinated, status, of, an, autochthonous, non, national, language, to, the, country, s, official, language, s, dialects, in, this, sense, do, not, derive, from, a, dominant, language, are, therefore, not, one, of, its, varieties, but, they, evolved, in, a, separate, and, parallel, way, while, they, may, be, historically, cognate, with, and, share, genetic, roots, in, the, same, subfamily, as, the, dominant, national, language, and, may, to, a, varying, degree, share, some, mutual, intelligibility, with, the, latter, dialects, under, this, second, definition, are, separate, languages, from, the, standard, or, national, language, under, this, definition, the, standard, or, national, language, would, not, itself, be, considered, a, dialect, as, it, is, the, dominant, language, in, terms, of, linguistic, prestige, social, or, political, e, g, official, status, predominance, or, prevalence, or, all, of, the, above, dialect, used, this, way, implies, a, political, connotation, often, being, used, to, refer, to, non, standardized, low, prestige, languages, regardless, of, their, actual, degree, of, distance, from, the, national, language, of, limited, geographic, distribution, languages, lacking, institutional, support, or, even, those, considered, to, be, unsuitable, for, writing, a, third, designation, dialect, is, occasionally, used, popularly, to, refer, to, the, unwritten, or, non, codified, languages, of, developing, countries, or, isolated, areas, where, the, term, vernacular, language, would, be, preferred, by, linguists, features, that, distinguish, dialects, from, each, other, can, be, found, in, lexicon, vocabulary, and, grammar, morphology, syntax, as, well, as, in, pronunciation, phonology, including, prosody, in, instances, where, the, salient, distinctions, are, only, or, mostly, to, be, observed, in, pronunciation, the, more, specific, term, accent, may, be, used, instead, of, dialect, differences, that, are, largely, concentrated, in, lexicon, may, be, classified, as, creoles, when, lexical, differences, are, mostly, concentrated, in, the, specialized, vocabulary, of, a, profession, or, other, organization, they, are, jargons, differences, in, vocabulary, that, are, deliberately, cultivated, to, exclude, outsiders, or, to, serve, as, shibboleths, are, known, as, cryptolects, or, cant, and, include, slangs, and, argots, the, particular, speech, patterns, used, by, an, individual, are, referred, to, as, that, person, s, idiolect, languages, are, classified, as, dialects, based, on, linguistic, distance, the, dialects, of, a, language, with, a, writing, system, will, operate, at, different, degrees, of, distance, from, the, standardized, written, form, some, dialects, of, a, language, are, not, mutually, intelligible, in, spoken, form, leading, to, debate, as, to, whether, they, are, regiolects, or, separate, languages, a, standard, dialect, also, known, as, a, standardized, language, is, supported, by, institutions, such, institutional, support, may, include, any, or, all, of, the, following, government, recognition, or, designation, formal, presentation, in, schooling, as, the, correct, form, of, a, language, informal, monitoring, of, everyday, usage, published, grammars, dictionaries, and, textbooks, that, set, forth, a, normative, spoken, and, written, form, and, an, extensive, formal, literature, be, it, prose, poetry, non, fiction, etc, that, uses, it, an, example, of, a, standardized, language, is, the, french, language, which, is, supported, by, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, institution, a, nonstandard, dialect, also, has, a, complete, grammar, and, vocabulary, but, is, usually, not, the, beneficiary, of, institutional, support, the, distinction, between, the, standard, dialect, and, the, nonstandard, vernacular, dialects, of, the, same, language, is, often, arbitrary, and, based, on, social, political, cultural, or, historical, considerations, or, prevalence, and, prominence, in, a, similar, way, the, definitions, of, the, terms, language, and, dialect, may, overlap, and, are, often, subject, to, debate, with, the, differentiation, between, the, two, classifications, often, grounded, in, arbitrary, or, sociopolitical, motives, and, the, term, dialect, is, sometimes, restricted, to, mean, non, standard, variety, particularly, in, non, specialist, settings, and, non, english, linguistic, traditions, the, term, is, applied, most, often, to, regional, speech, patterns, but, a, dialect, may, also, be, defined, by, other, factors, such, as, social, class, or, ethnicity, a, dialect, that, is, associated, with, a, particular, social, class, can, be, termed, a, sociolect, a, dialect, that, is, associated, with, a, particular, ethnic, group, can, be, termed, an, ethnolect, a, geographical, regional, dialect, may, be, termed, a, regiolect, alternative, terms, include, regionalect, geolect, and, topolect, according, to, this, definition, any, variety, of, a, given, language, can, be, classified, as, a, dialect, including, any, standardized, varieties, in, this, case, the, distinction, between, the, standard, language, i, e, the, standard, dialect, of, a, particular, language, and, the, nonstandard, vernacular, dialects, of, the, same, language, is, often, arbitrary, and, based, on, social, political, cultural, or, historical, considerations, or, prevalence, and, prominence, in, a, similar, way, the, definitions, of, the, terms, language, and, dialect, may, overlap, and, are, often, subject, to, debate, with, the, differentiation, between, the, two, classifications, often, grounded, in, arbitrary, or, sociopolitical, motives, the, term, dialect, is, however, sometimes, restricted, to, mean, non, standard, variety, particularly, in, non, specialist, settings, and, non, english, linguistic, traditions, conversely, some, dialectologists, have, reserved, the, term, dialect, for, forms, that, they, believed, sometimes, wrongly, to, be, purer, forms, of, the, older, languages, as, in, how, early, dialectologists, of, english, did, not, consider, the, brummie, of, birmingham, or, the, scouse, of, liverpool, to, be, real, dialects, as, they, had, arisen, fairly, recently, in, time, and, partly, as, a, result, of, influences, from, irish, migrants, there, is, no, universally, accepted, criterion, for, distinguishing, two, different, languages, from, two, dialects, i, e, varieties, of, the, same, language, a, number, of, rough, measures, exist, sometimes, leading, to, contradictory, results, the, distinction, between, dialect, and, language, is, therefore, subjective, and, depends, upon, the, user, s, preferred, frame, of, reference, for, example, there, has, been, discussion, about, whether, or, not, the, lim, n, creole, english, should, be, considered, a, kind, of, english, or, a, different, language, this, creole, is, spoken, in, the, caribbean, coast, of, costa, rica, central, america, by, descendants, of, jamaican, people, the, position, that, costa, rican, linguists, support, depends, upon, which, university, they, represent, another, example, is, scanian, which, even, for, a, time, had, its, own, iso, code, an, important, criterion, for, categorizing, varieties, of, language, is, linguistic, distance, for, a, variety, to, be, considered, a, dialect, the, linguistic, distance, between, the, two, varieties, must, be, low, linguistic, distance, between, spoken, or, written, forms, of, language, increases, as, the, differences, between, the, forms, are, characterized, for, example, two, languages, with, completely, different, syntactical, structures, would, have, a, high, linguistic, distance, while, a, language, with, very, few, differences, from, another, may, be, considered, a, dialect, or, a, sibling, of, that, language, linguistic, distance, may, be, used, to, determine, language, families, and, language, siblings, for, example, languages, with, little, linguistic, distance, like, dutch, and, german, are, considered, siblings, dutch, and, german, are, siblings, in, the, west, germanic, language, group, some, language, siblings, are, closer, to, each, other, in, terms, of, linguistic, distance, than, to, other, linguistic, siblings, french, and, spanish, siblings, in, the, romance, branch, of, the, indo, european, group, are, closer, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, any, of, the, languages, of, the, west, germanic, group, when, languages, are, close, in, terms, of, linguistic, distance, they, resemble, one, another, hence, why, dialects, are, not, considered, linguistically, distant, to, their, parent, language, one, criterion, which, is, often, considered, to, be, purely, linguistic, is, that, of, mutual, intelligibility, two, varieties, are, said, to, be, dialects, of, the, same, language, if, being, a, speaker, of, one, variety, has, sufficient, knowledge, to, understand, and, be, understood, by, a, speaker, of, the, other, dialect, otherwise, they, are, said, to, be, different, languages, however, this, definition, has, often, been, criticized, especially, in, the, case, of, a, dialect, continuum, or, dialect, chain, which, contains, a, sequence, of, varieties, where, each, mutually, intelligible, with, the, next, but, may, not, be, mutually, intelligible, with, distant, varieties, others, have, argued, that, mutual, intelligibility, occurs, in, varying, degrees, and, the, potential, difficulty, in, distinguishing, between, intelligibility, and, prior, familiarity, with, the, other, variety, however, recent, research, suggests, that, there, is, some, empirical, evidence, in, favor, of, using, some, form, of, the, intelligibility, criterion, to, distinguish, between, languages, and, dialects, though, mutuality, may, not, be, as, relevant, as, initially, thought, the, requirement, for, mutuality, is, abandoned, by, the, language, survey, reference, guide, of, sil, international, publishers, of, the, ethnologue, and, the, registration, authority, for, the, iso, 639, 3, standard, for, language, codes, they, define, a, dialect, cluster, as, a, central, variety, together, with, all, those, varieties, whose, speakers, understand, the, central, variety, at, a, specified, threshold, level, or, higher, if, the, threshold, level, is, high, usually, between, 70, and, 85, the, cluster, is, designated, as, a, language, another, occasionally, used, criterion, for, discriminating, dialects, from, languages, is, the, sociolinguistic, notion, of, linguistic, authority, according, to, this, definition, two, varieties, are, considered, dialects, of, the, same, language, if, under, at, least, some, circumstances, they, would, defer, to, the, same, authority, regarding, some, questions, about, their, language, for, instance, to, learn, the, name, of, a, new, invention, or, an, obscure, foreign, species, of, plant, speakers, of, westphalian, and, east, franconian, german, might, each, consult, a, german, dictionary, or, ask, a, german, speaking, expert, in, the, subject, thus, these, varieties, are, said, to, be, dependent, on, or, heteronomous, with, respect, to, standard, german, which, is, said, to, be, autonomous, in, contrast, speakers, in, the, netherlands, of, low, saxon, varieties, similar, to, westphalian, would, instead, consult, a, dictionary, of, standard, dutch, and, hence, is, categorized, as, a, dialect, of, dutch, instead, similarly, although, yiddish, is, classified, by, linguists, as, a, language, in, the, high, german, group, of, languages, and, has, some, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, with, german, a, yiddish, speaker, would, consult, a, yiddish, dictionary, rather, than, a, german, dictionary, in, such, a, case, and, is, classified, as, its, own, language, within, this, framework, w, a, stewart, defined, a, language, as, an, autonomous, variety, in, addition, to, all, the, varieties, that, are, heteronomous, with, respect, to, it, noting, that, an, essentially, equivalent, definition, had, been, stated, by, charles, a, ferguson, and, john, j, gumperz, in, 1960, a, heteronomous, variety, may, be, considered, a, dialect, of, a, language, defined, in, this, way, in, these, terms, danish, and, norwegian, though, mutually, intelligible, to, a, large, degree, are, considered, separate, languages, in, the, framework, of, heinz, kloss, these, are, described, as, languages, by, ausbau, development, rather, than, by, abstand, separation, in, other, situations, a, closely, related, group, of, varieties, possess, considerable, though, incomplete, mutual, intelligibility, but, none, dominates, the, others, to, describe, this, situation, the, editors, of, the, handbook, of, african, languages, introduced, the, term, dialect, cluster, as, a, classificatory, unit, at, the, same, level, as, a, language, a, similar, situation, but, with, a, greater, degree, of, mutual, unintelligibility, has, been, termed, a, language, cluster, in, the, language, survey, reference, guide, issued, by, sil, international, who, produce, ethnologue, a, dialect, cluster, is, defined, as, a, central, variety, together, with, a, collection, of, varieties, whose, speakers, can, understand, the, central, variety, at, a, specified, threshold, level, usually, between, 70, and, 85, or, higher, it, is, not, required, that, peripheral, varieties, be, understood, by, speakers, of, the, central, variety, or, of, other, peripheral, varieties, a, minimal, set, of, central, varieties, providing, coverage, of, a, dialect, continuum, may, be, selected, algorithmically, from, intelligibility, data, in, many, societies, however, a, particular, dialect, often, the, sociolect, of, the, elite, class, comes, to, be, identified, as, the, standard, or, proper, version, of, a, language, by, those, seeking, to, make, a, social, distinction, and, is, contrasted, with, other, varieties, as, a, result, of, this, in, some, contexts, the, term, dialect, refers, specifically, to, varieties, with, low, social, status, in, this, secondary, sense, of, dialect, language, varieties, are, often, called, dialects, rather, than, languages, the, status, of, language, is, not, solely, determined, by, linguistic, criteria, but, it, is, also, the, result, of, a, historical, and, political, development, romansh, came, to, be, a, written, language, and, therefore, it, is, recognized, as, a, language, even, though, it, is, very, close, to, the, lombardic, alpine, dialects, and, classical, latin, an, opposite, example, is, chinese, whose, variations, such, as, mandarin, and, cantonese, are, often, called, dialects, and, not, languages, in, china, despite, their, mutual, unintelligibility, national, boundaries, sometimes, make, the, distinction, between, language, and, dialect, an, issue, of, political, importance, a, group, speaking, a, separate, language, may, be, seen, as, having, a, greater, claim, to, being, a, separate, people, and, thus, to, be, more, deserving, of, its, own, independent, state, while, a, group, speaking, a, dialect, may, be, seen, as, a, sub, group, part, of, a, bigger, people, which, must, content, itself, with, regional, autonomy, the, yiddish, linguist, max, weinreich, published, the, expression, a, shprakh, iz, a, dialekt, mit, an, armey, un, flot, a, language, is, a, dialect, with, an, army, and, navy, in, yivo, bleter, 25, 1, 1945, p, 13, the, significance, of, the, political, factors, in, any, attempt, at, answering, the, question, what, is, a, language, is, great, enough, to, cast, doubt, on, whether, any, strictly, linguistic, definition, without, a, socio, cultural, approach, is, possible, this, is, illustrated, by, the, frequency, with, which, the, army, navy, aphorism, is, cited, by, the, definition, most, commonly, used, by, linguists, any, linguistic, variety, can, be, considered, a, dialect, of, some, language, everybody, speaks, a, dialect, according, to, that, interpretation, the, criteria, above, merely, serve, to, distinguish, whether, two, varieties, are, dialects, of, the, same, language, or, dialects, of, different, languages, the, terms, language, and, dialect, are, not, necessarily, mutually, exclusive, although, they, are, often, perceived, to, be, thus, there, is, nothing, contradictory, in, the, statement, the, language, of, the, pennsylvania, dutch, is, a, dialect, of, german, there, are, various, terms, that, linguists, may, use, to, avoid, taking, a, position, on, whether, the, speech, of, a, community, is, an, independent, language, in, its, own, right, or, a, dialect, of, another, language, perhaps, the, most, common, is, variety, lect, is, another, a, more, general, term, is, languoid, which, does, not, distinguish, between, dialects, languages, and, groups, of, languages, whether, genealogically, related, or, not, the, colloquial, meaning, of, dialect, can, be, understood, by, example, e, g, in, italy, see, dialetto, france, see, patois, and, the, philippines, carries, a, pejorative, undertone, and, underlines, the, politically, and, socially, subordinated, status, of, a, non, national, language, to, the, country, s, single, official, language, in, other, words, these, dialects, are, not, actual, dialects, in, the, same, sense, as, in, the, first, usage, as, they, do, not, derive, from, the, politically, dominant, language, and, are, therefore, not, one, of, its, varieties, but, instead, they, evolved, in, a, separate, and, parallel, way, and, may, thus, better, fit, various, parties, criteria, for, a, separate, language, despite, this, these, dialects, may, often, be, historically, cognate, and, share, genetic, roots, in, the, same, subfamily, as, the, dominant, national, language, and, may, even, to, a, varying, degree, share, some, mutual, intelligibility, with, the, latter, in, this, sense, unlike, in, the, first, usage, the, national, language, would, not, itself, be, considered, a, dialect, as, it, is, the, dominant, language, in, a, particular, state, be, it, in, terms, of, linguistic, prestige, social, or, political, e, g, official, status, predominance, or, prevalence, or, all, of, the, above, the, term, dialect, used, this, way, implies, a, political, connotation, being, mostly, used, to, refer, to, low, prestige, languages, regardless, of, their, actual, degree, of, distance, from, the, national, language, languages, lacking, institutional, support, or, those, perceived, as, unsuitable, for, writing, the, designation, dialect, is, also, used, popularly, to, refer, to, the, unwritten, or, non, codified, languages, of, developing, countries, or, isolated, areas, where, the, term, vernacular, language, would, be, preferred, by, linguists, john, lyons, writes, that, many, linguists, subsume, differences, of, accent, under, differences, of, dialect, in, general, accent, refers, to, variations, in, pronunciation, while, dialect, also, encompasses, specific, variations, in, grammar, and, vocabulary, there, are, three, geographical, zones, in, which, arabic, is, spoken, jastrow, 2002, zone, i, is, categorized, as, the, area, in, which, arabic, was, spoken, before, the, rise, of, islam, it, is, the, arabian, peninsula, excluding, the, areas, where, southern, arabian, was, spoken, zone, ii, is, categorized, as, the, areas, to, which, arabic, speaking, peoples, moved, as, a, result, of, the, conquests, of, islam, included, in, zone, ii, are, the, levant, egypt, north, africa, iraq, and, some, parts, of, iran, the, egyptian, sudanese, and, levantine, dialects, including, the, syrian, dialect, are, well, documented, and, widely, spoken, and, studied, zone, iii, comprises, the, areas, in, which, arabic, is, spoken, outside, of, the, continuous, arabic, language, area, spoken, dialects, of, the, arabic, language, share, the, same, writing, system, and, share, modern, standard, arabic, as, their, common, prestige, dialect, used, in, writing, when, talking, about, the, german, language, the, term, german, dialects, is, only, used, for, the, traditional, regional, varieties, that, allows, them, to, be, distinguished, from, the, regional, varieties, of, modern, standard, german, the, german, dialects, show, a, wide, spectrum, of, variation, some, of, them, are, not, mutually, intelligible, german, dialectology, traditionally, names, the, major, dialect, groups, after, germanic, tribes, from, which, they, were, assumed, to, have, descended, the, extent, to, which, the, dialects, are, spoken, varies, according, to, a, number, of, factors, in, northern, germany, dialects, are, less, common, than, in, the, south, in, cities, dialects, are, less, common, than, in, the, countryside, in, a, public, environment, dialects, are, less, common, than, in, a, familiar, environment, the, situation, in, switzerland, and, liechtenstein, is, different, from, the, rest, of, the, german, speaking, countries, the, swiss, german, dialects, are, the, default, everyday, language, in, virtually, every, situation, whereas, standard, german, is, only, spoken, in, education, partially, in, media, and, with, foreigners, not, possessing, knowledge, of, swiss, german, most, swiss, german, speakers, perceive, standard, german, to, be, a, foreign, language, the, low, german, and, low, franconian, varieties, spoken, in, germany, are, often, counted, among, the, german, dialects, this, reflects, the, modern, situation, where, they, are, roofed, by, standard, german, this, is, different, from, the, situation, in, the, middle, ages, when, low, german, had, strong, tendencies, towards, an, ausbau, language, the, frisian, languages, spoken, in, germany, and, the, netherlands, are, excluded, from, the, german, dialects, italy, is, an, often, quoted, example, of, a, country, where, the, second, definition, of, the, word, dialect, dialetto, is, most, prevalent, italy, is, in, fact, home, to, a, vast, array, of, separate, languages, most, of, which, lack, mutual, intelligibility, with, one, another, and, have, their, own, local, varieties, twelve, of, them, albanian, catalan, german, greek, slovene, croatian, french, franco, proven, al, friulian, ladin, occitan, and, sardinian, underwent, italianization, to, a, varying, degree, ranging, from, the, currently, endangered, state, displayed, by, sardinian, and, southern, italian, greek, to, the, vigorous, promotion, of, germanic, tyrolean, but, have, been, officially, recognized, as, minority, languages, minoranze, linguistiche, storiche, in, light, of, their, distinctive, historical, development, yet, most, of, the, regional, languages, spoken, across, the, peninsula, are, often, colloquially, referred, to, in, non, linguistic, circles, as, italian, dialetti, since, most, of, them, including, the, prestigious, neapolitan, sicilian, and, venetian, have, adopted, vulgar, tuscan, as, their, reference, language, since, the, middle, ages, however, all, these, languages, evolved, from, vulgar, latin, in, parallel, with, italian, long, prior, to, the, popular, diffusion, of, the, latter, throughout, what, is, now, italy, during, the, risorgimento, italian, still, existed, mainly, as, a, literary, language, and, only, 2, 5, of, italy, s, population, could, speak, italian, proponents, of, italian, nationalism, like, the, lombard, alessandro, manzoni, stressed, the, importance, of, establishing, a, uniform, national, language, in, order, to, better, create, an, italian, national, identity, with, the, unification, of, italy, in, the, 1860s, italian, became, the, official, national, language, of, the, new, italian, state, while, the, other, ones, came, to, be, institutionally, regarded, as, dialects, subordinate, to, italian, and, negatively, associated, with, a, lack, of, education, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, conscription, of, italian, men, from, all, throughout, italy, during, world, war, i, is, credited, with, having, facilitated, the, diffusion, of, italian, among, the, less, educated, conscripted, soldiers, as, these, men, who, had, been, speaking, various, regional, languages, up, until, then, found, themselves, forced, to, communicate, with, each, other, in, a, common, tongue, while, serving, in, the, italian, military, with, the, popular, spread, of, italian, out, of, the, intellectual, circles, because, of, the, mass, media, and, the, establishment, of, public, education, italians, from, all, regions, were, increasingly, exposed, to, italian, while, dialect, levelling, has, increased, the, number, of, italian, speakers, and, decreased, the, number, of, speakers, of, other, languages, native, to, italy, italians, in, different, regions, have, developed, variations, of, standard, italian, specific, to, their, region, these, variations, of, standard, italian, known, as, regional, italian, would, thus, more, appropriately, be, called, dialects, in, accordance, with, the, first, linguistic, definition, of, the, term, as, they, are, in, fact, derived, from, italian, with, some, degree, of, influence, from, the, local, or, regional, native, languages, and, accents, the, most, widely, spoken, languages, of, italy, which, are, not, to, be, confused, with, regional, italian, fall, within, a, family, of, which, even, italian, is, part, the, italo, dalmatian, group, this, wide, category, includes, modern, italian, is, heavily, based, on, the, florentine, dialect, of, tuscan, the, tuscan, based, language, that, would, eventually, become, modern, italian, had, been, used, in, poetry, and, literature, since, at, least, the, 12th, century, and, it, first, spread, outside, the, tuscan, linguistic, borders, through, the, works, of, the, so, called, tre, corone, three, crowns, dante, alighieri, petrarch, and, giovanni, boccaccio, florentine, thus, gradually, rose, to, prominence, as, the, volgare, of, the, literate, and, upper, class, in, italy, and, it, spread, throughout, the, peninsula, and, sicily, as, the, lingua, franca, among, the, italian, educated, class, as, well, as, italian, travelling, merchants, the, economic, prowess, and, cultural, and, artistic, importance, of, tuscany, in, the, late, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, further, encouraged, the, diffusion, of, the, florentine, tuscan, italian, throughout, italy, and, among, the, educated, and, powerful, though, local, and, regional, languages, remained, the, main, languages, of, the, common, people, aside, from, the, italo, dalmatian, languages, the, second, most, widespread, family, in, italy, is, the, gallo, italic, group, spanning, throughout, much, of, northern, italy, s, languages, and, dialects, such, as, piedmontese, emilian, romagnol, ligurian, lombard, venetian, sicily, s, and, basilicata, s, gallo, italic, in, southern, italy, etc, finally, other, languages, from, a, number, of, different, families, follow, the, last, two, major, groups, the, gallo, romance, languages, french, occitan, and, its, vivaro, alpine, dialect, franco, proven, al, the, rhaeto, romance, languages, friulian, and, ladin, the, ibero, romance, languages, sardinia, s, algherese, the, germanic, cimbrian, southern, bavarian, walser, german, and, the, m, cheno, language, the, albanian, arb, resh, language, the, hellenic, griko, language, and, calabrian, greek, the, serbo, croatian, slavomolisano, dialect, and, the, various, slovene, languages, including, the, gail, valley, dialect, and, istrian, dialect, the, language, indigenous, to, sardinia, while, being, romance, in, nature, is, considered, to, be, a, specific, linguistic, family, of, its, own, separate, from, the, other, neo, latin, groups, it, is, often, subdivided, into, the, centro, southern, and, centro, northern, dialects, though, mostly, mutually, unintelligible, the, exact, degree, to, which, all, the, italian, languages, are, mutually, unintelligible, varies, often, correlating, with, geographical, distance, or, geographical, barriers, between, the, languages, some, regional, italian, languages, that, are, closer, in, geographical, proximity, to, each, other, or, closer, to, each, other, on, the, dialect, continuum, are, more, or, less, mutually, intelligible, for, instance, a, speaker, of, purely, eastern, lombard, a, language, in, northern, italy, s, lombardy, region, that, includes, the, bergamasque, dialect, would, have, severely, limited, mutual, intelligibility, with, a, purely, italian, speaker, and, would, be, nearly, completely, unintelligible, to, a, sicilian, speaking, individual, due, to, eastern, lombard, s, status, as, a, gallo, italic, language, an, eastern, lombard, speaker, may, in, fact, have, more, mutual, intelligibility, with, an, occitan, catalan, or, french, speaker, than, with, an, italian, or, sicilian, speaker, meanwhile, a, sicilian, speaking, person, would, have, a, greater, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, with, a, speaker, of, the, more, closely, related, neapolitan, language, but, far, less, mutual, intelligibility, with, a, person, speaking, sicilian, gallo, italic, a, language, that, developed, in, isolated, lombard, emigrant, communities, on, the, same, island, as, the, sicilian, language, today, the, majority, of, italian, nationals, are, able, to, speak, italian, though, many, italians, still, speak, their, regional, language, regularly, or, as, their, primary, day, to, day, language, especially, at, home, with, family, or, when, communicating, with, italians, from, the, same, town, or, region, the, classification, of, speech, varieties, as, dialects, or, languages, and, their, relationship, to, other, varieties, of, speech, can, be, controversial, and, the, verdicts, inconsistent, serbo, croatian, illustrates, this, point, serbo, croatian, has, two, major, formal, variants, serbian, and, croatian, both, are, based, on, the, shtokavian, dialect, and, therefore, mutually, intelligible, with, differences, found, mostly, in, their, respective, local, vocabularies, and, minor, grammatical, differences, certain, dialects, of, serbia, torlakian, and, croatia, kajkavian, and, chakavian, however, are, not, mutually, intelligible, even, though, they, are, usually, subsumed, under, serbo, croatian, how, these, dialects, should, be, classified, in, relation, to, shtokavian, remains, a, matter, of, dispute, macedonian, although, largely, mutually, intelligible, with, bulgarian, and, certain, dialects, of, serbo, croatian, torlakian, is, considered, by, bulgarian, linguists, to, be, a, bulgarian, dialect, in, contrast, with, the, view, in, north, macedonia, which, regards, it, as, a, language, in, its, own, right, before, the, establishment, of, a, literary, standard, of, macedonian, in, 1944, in, most, sources, in, and, out, of, bulgaria, before, the, second, world, war, the, south, slavic, dialect, continuum, covering, the, area, of, today, s, north, macedonia, were, referred, to, as, bulgarian, dialects, sociolinguists, agree, that, the, question, of, whether, macedonian, is, a, dialect, of, bulgarian, or, a, language, is, a, political, one, and, cannot, be, resolved, on, a, purely, linguistic, basis, in, lebanon, a, part, of, the, christian, population, considers, lebanese, to, be, in, some, sense, a, distinct, language, from, arabic, and, not, merely, a, dialect, thereof, during, the, civil, war, christians, often, used, lebanese, arabic, officially, and, sporadically, used, the, latin, script, to, write, lebanese, thus, further, distinguishing, it, from, arabic, all, lebanese, laws, are, written, in, the, standard, literary, form, of, arabic, though, parliamentary, debate, may, be, conducted, in, lebanese, arabic, in, tunisia, algeria, and, morocco, the, darijas, translated, as, literally, meaning, dialect, in, arabic, spoken, north, african, languages, are, sometimes, considered, more, different, from, other, arabic, dialects, officially, north, african, countries, prefer, to, give, preference, to, the, literary, arabic, and, conduct, much, of, their, political, and, religious, life, in, it, adherence, to, islam, and, refrain, from, declaring, each, country, s, specific, variety, to, be, a, separate, language, because, literary, arabic, is, the, liturgical, language, of, islam, and, the, language, of, the, islamic, sacred, book, the, qur, an, although, especially, since, the, 1960s, the, darijas, are, occupying, an, increasing, use, and, influence, in, the, cultural, life, of, these, countries, examples, of, cultural, elements, where, darijas, use, became, dominant, include, theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social, media, folk, tale, books, and, companies, names, the, modern, ukrainian, language, has, been, in, common, use, since, the, late, 17th, century, associated, with, the, establishment, of, the, cossack, hetmanate, in, the, 19th, century, the, tsarist, government, of, the, russian, empire, claimed, that, ukrainian, or, little, russian, per, official, name, was, merely, a, dialect, of, russian, or, polonized, dialect, and, not, a, language, on, its, own, same, concept, as, for, belarusian, language, that, concepted, was, enrooted, soon, after, the, partitions, of, poland, according, to, these, claims, the, differences, were, few, and, caused, by, the, conquest, of, western, ukraine, by, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, however, in, reality, the, dialects, in, ukraine, were, developing, independently, from, the, dialects, in, the, modern, russia, for, several, centuries, and, as, a, result, they, differed, substantially, following, the, spring, of, nations, in, europe, and, efforts, of, the, brotherhood, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, across, the, so, called, southwestern, krai, of, russian, empire, started, to, spread, cultural, societies, of, hromada, and, their, sunday, schools, themselves, hromadas, acted, in, same, manner, as, orthodox, fraternities, of, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, back, in, 15th, century, around, that, time, in, ukraine, becoming, popular, political, movements, narodnichestvo, narodniks, and, khlopomanstvo, there, have, been, cases, of, a, variety, of, speech, being, deliberately, reclassified, to, serve, political, purposes, one, example, is, moldovan, in, 1996, the, moldovan, parliament, citing, fears, of, romanian, expansionism, rejected, a, proposal, from, president, mircea, snegur, to, change, the, name, of, the, language, to, romanian, and, in, 2003, a, moldovan, romanian, dictionary, was, published, purporting, to, show, that, the, two, countries, speak, different, languages, linguists, of, the, romanian, academy, reacted, by, declaring, that, all, the, moldovan, words, were, also, romanian, words, while, in, moldova, the, head, of, the, academy, of, sciences, of, moldova, ion, b, rbu, described, the, dictionary, as, a, politically, motivated, absurdity, unlike, languages, that, use, alphabets, to, indicate, their, pronunciation, chinese, characters, have, developed, from, logograms, that, do, not, always, give, hints, to, their, pronunciation, although, the, written, characters, have, remained, relatively, consistent, for, the, last, two, thousand, years, the, pronunciation, and, grammar, in, different, regions, have, developed, to, an, extent, that, the, varieties, of, the, spoken, language, are, often, mutually, unintelligible, as, a, series, of, migration, to, the, south, throughout, the, history, the, regional, languages, of, the, south, including, gan, xiang, wu, min, yue, and, hakka, often, show, traces, of, old, chinese, or, middle, chinese, from, the, ming, dynasty, onward, beijing, has, been, the, capital, of, china, and, the, dialect, spoken, in, beijing, has, had, the, most, prestige, among, other, varieties, with, the, founding, of, the, republic, of, china, standard, mandarin, was, designated, as, the, official, language, based, on, the, spoken, language, of, beijing, since, then, other, spoken, varieties, are, regarded, as, fangyan, regional, speech, cantonese, is, still, the, most, commonly, used, language, in, guangzhou, hong, kong, macau, and, among, some, overseas, chinese, communities, whereas, hokkien, has, been, accepted, in, taiwan, as, an, important, local, language, alongside, mandarin
