confirmation, bias, also, confirmatory, bias, myside, bias, or, congeniality, bias, is, the, tendency, to, search, for, interpret, favor, and, recall, information, in, a, way, that, confirms, or, supports, one, s, prior, beliefs, or, values, people, display, this, bias, when, they, select, information, that, supports, their, views, ignoring, contrary, information, or, when, they, interpret, ambiguous, evidence, as, supporting, their, existing, attitudes, the, effect, is, strongest, for, desired, outcomes, for, emotionally, charged, issues, and, for, deeply, entrenched, beliefs, biased, search, for, information, biased, interpretation, of, this, information, and, biased, memory, recall, have, been, invoked, to, explain, four, specific, effects, a, series, of, psychological, experiments, in, the, 1960s, suggested, that, people, are, biased, toward, confirming, their, existing, beliefs, later, work, re, interpreted, these, results, as, a, tendency, to, test, ideas, in, a, one, sided, way, focusing, on, one, possibility, and, ignoring, alternatives, explanations, for, the, observed, biases, include, wishful, thinking, and, the, limited, human, capacity, to, process, information, another, proposal, is, that, people, show, confirmation, bias, because, they, are, pragmatically, assessing, the, costs, of, being, wrong, rather, than, investigating, in, a, neutral, scientific, way, flawed, decisions, due, to, confirmation, bias, have, been, found, in, a, wide, range, of, political, organizational, financial, and, scientific, contexts, these, biases, contribute, to, overconfidence, in, personal, beliefs, and, can, maintain, or, strengthen, beliefs, in, the, face, of, contrary, evidence, for, example, confirmation, bias, produces, systematic, errors, in, scientific, research, based, on, inductive, reasoning, the, gradual, accumulation, of, supportive, evidence, similarly, a, police, detective, may, identify, a, suspect, early, in, an, investigation, but, then, may, only, seek, confirming, rather, than, disconfirming, evidence, a, medical, practitioner, may, prematurely, focus, on, a, particular, disorder, early, in, a, diagnostic, session, and, then, seek, only, confirming, evidence, in, social, media, confirmation, bias, is, amplified, by, the, use, of, filter, bubbles, or, algorithmic, editing, which, display, to, individuals, only, information, they, are, likely, to, agree, with, while, excluding, opposing, views, confirmation, bias, a, phrase, coined, by, english, psychologist, peter, wason, is, the, tendency, of, people, to, favor, information, that, confirms, or, strengthens, their, beliefs, or, values, and, is, difficult, to, dislodge, once, affirmed, confirmation, biases, are, effects, in, information, processing, they, differ, from, what, is, sometimes, called, the, behavioral, confirmation, effect, commonly, known, as, self, fulfilling, prophecy, in, which, a, person, s, expectations, influence, their, own, behavior, bringing, about, the, expected, result, some, psychologists, restrict, the, term, confirmation, bias, to, selective, collection, of, evidence, that, supports, what, one, already, believes, while, ignoring, or, rejecting, evidence, that, supports, a, different, conclusion, others, apply, the, term, more, broadly, to, the, tendency, to, preserve, one, s, existing, beliefs, when, searching, for, evidence, interpreting, it, or, recalling, it, from, memory, confirmation, bias, is, a, result, of, automatic, unintentional, strategies, rather, than, deliberate, deception, experiments, have, found, repeatedly, that, people, tend, to, test, hypotheses, in, a, one, sided, way, by, searching, for, evidence, consistent, with, their, current, hypothesis, 177, 178, rather, than, searching, through, all, the, relevant, evidence, they, phrase, questions, to, receive, an, affirmative, answer, that, supports, their, theory, they, look, for, the, consequences, that, they, would, expect, if, their, hypothesis, was, true, rather, than, what, would, happen, if, it, was, false, for, example, someone, using, yes, no, questions, to, find, a, number, they, suspect, to, be, the, number, 3, might, ask, is, it, an, odd, number, people, prefer, this, type, of, question, called, a, positive, test, even, when, a, negative, test, such, as, is, it, an, even, number, would, yield, exactly, the, same, information, however, this, does, not, mean, that, people, seek, tests, that, guarantee, a, positive, answer, in, studies, where, subjects, could, select, either, such, pseudo, tests, or, genuinely, diagnostic, ones, they, favored, the, genuinely, diagnostic, the, preference, for, positive, tests, in, itself, is, not, a, bias, since, positive, tests, can, be, highly, informative, however, in, combination, with, other, effects, this, strategy, can, confirm, existing, beliefs, or, assumptions, independently, of, whether, they, are, true, in, real, world, situations, evidence, is, often, complex, and, mixed, for, example, various, contradictory, ideas, about, someone, could, each, be, supported, by, concentrating, on, one, aspect, of, his, or, her, behavior, thus, any, search, for, evidence, in, favor, of, a, hypothesis, is, likely, to, succeed, one, illustration, of, this, is, the, way, the, phrasing, of, a, question, can, significantly, change, the, answer, for, example, people, who, are, asked, are, you, happy, with, your, social, life, report, greater, satisfaction, than, those, asked, are, you, un, happy, with, your, social, life, even, a, small, change, in, a, question, s, wording, can, affect, how, people, search, through, available, information, and, hence, the, conclusions, they, reach, this, was, shown, using, a, fictional, child, custody, case, participants, read, that, parent, a, was, moderately, suitable, to, be, the, guardian, in, multiple, ways, parent, b, had, a, mix, of, salient, positive, and, negative, qualities, a, close, relationship, with, the, child, but, a, job, that, would, take, them, away, for, long, periods, of, time, when, asked, which, parent, should, have, custody, of, the, child, the, majority, of, participants, chose, parent, b, looking, mainly, for, positive, attributes, however, when, asked, which, parent, should, be, denied, custody, of, the, child, they, looked, for, negative, attributes, and, the, majority, answered, that, parent, b, should, be, denied, custody, implying, that, parent, a, should, have, custody, similar, studies, have, demonstrated, how, people, engage, in, a, biased, search, for, information, but, also, that, this, phenomenon, may, be, limited, by, a, preference, for, genuine, diagnostic, tests, in, an, initial, experiment, participants, rated, another, person, on, the, introversion, extroversion, personality, dimension, on, the, basis, of, an, interview, they, chose, the, interview, questions, from, a, given, list, when, the, interviewee, was, introduced, as, an, introvert, the, participants, chose, questions, that, presumed, introversion, such, as, what, do, you, find, unpleasant, about, noisy, parties, when, the, interviewee, was, described, as, extroverted, almost, all, the, questions, presumed, extroversion, such, as, what, would, you, do, to, liven, up, a, dull, party, these, loaded, questions, gave, the, interviewees, little, or, no, opportunity, to, falsify, the, hypothesis, about, them, a, later, version, of, the, experiment, gave, the, participants, less, presumptive, questions, to, choose, from, such, as, do, you, shy, away, from, social, interactions, participants, preferred, to, ask, these, more, diagnostic, questions, showing, only, a, weak, bias, towards, positive, tests, this, pattern, of, a, main, preference, for, diagnostic, tests, and, a, weaker, preference, for, positive, tests, has, been, replicated, in, other, studies, personality, traits, influence, and, interact, with, biased, search, processes,

information, that, is, consistent, rather, than, inconsistent, with, their, personal, beliefs, an, experiment, examined, the, extent, to, which, individuals, could, refute, arguments, that, contradicted, their, personal, beliefs, people, with, high, confidence, levels, more, readily, seek, out, contradictory, information, to, their, personal, position, to, form, an, argument, this, can, take, the, form, of, an, oppositional, news, consumption, where, individuals, seek, opposing, partisan, news, in, order, to, counterargue, individuals, with, low, confidence, levels, do, not, seek, out, contradictory, information, and, prefer, information, that, supports, their, personal, position, people, generate, and, evaluate, evidence, in, arguments, that, are, biased, towards, their, own, beliefs, and, opinions, heightened, confidence, levels, decrease, preference, for, information, that, supports, individuals, personal, beliefs, another, experiment, gave, participants, a, complex, rule, discovery, task, that, involved, moving, objects, simulated, by, a, computer, objects, on, the, computer, screen, followed, specific, laws, which, the, participants, had, to, figure, out, so, participants, could, fire, objects, across, the, screen, to, test, their, hypotheses, despite, making, many, attempts, over, a, ten, hour, session, none, of, the, participants, figured, out, the, rules, of, the, system, they, typically, attempted, to, confirm, rather, than, falsify, their, hypotheses, and, were, reluctant, to, consider, alternatives, even, after, seeing, objective, evidence, that, refuted, their, working, hypotheses, they, frequently, continued, doing, the, same, tests, some, of, the, participants, were, taught, proper, hypothesis, testing, but, these, instructions, had,

are, not, limited, to, the, collection, of, evidence, even, if, two, individuals, have, the, same, information, the, way, they, interpret, it, can, be, biased, a, team, at, stanford, university, conducted, an, experiment, involving, participants, who, felt, strongly, about, capital, punishment, with, half, in, favor, and, half, against, it, each, participant, read, descriptions, of, two, studies, a, comparison, of, u, s, states, with, and, without, the, death, penalty, and, a, comparison, of, murder, rates, in, a, state, before, and, after, the, introduction, of, the, death, penalty, after, reading, a, quick, description, of, each, study, the, participants, were, asked, whether, their, opinions, had, changed, then, they, read, a, more, detailed, account, of, each, study, s, procedure, and, had, to, rate, whether, the, research, was, well, conducted, and, convincing, in, fact, the, studies, were, fictional, half, the, participants, were, told, that, one, kind, of, study, supported, the, deterrent, effect, and, the, other, undermined, it, while, for, other, participants, the, conclusions, were, swapped, the, participants, whether, supporters, or, opponents, reported, shifting, their, attitudes, slightly, in, the, direction, of, the, first, study, they, read, once, they, read, the, more, detailed, descriptions, of, the, two, studies, they, almost, all, returned, to, their, original, belief, regardless, of, the, evidence, provided, pointing, to, details, that, supported, their, viewpoint, and, disregarding, anything, contrary, participants, described, studies, supporting, their, pre, existing, view, as, superior, to, those, that, contradicted, it, in, detailed, and, specific, ways, writing, about, a, study, that, seemed, to, undermine, the, deterrence, effect, a, death, penalty, proponent, wrote, the, research, didn, t, cover, a, long, enough, period, of, time, while, an, opponent, s, comment, on, the, same, study, said, no, strong, evidence, to, contradict, the, researchers, has, been, presented, the, results, illustrated, that, people, set, higher, standards, of, evidence, for, hypotheses, that, go, against, their, current, expectations, this, effect, known, as, disconfirmation, bias, has, been, supported, by, other, experiments, another, study, of, biased, interpretation, occurred, during, the, 2004, u, s, presidential, election, and, involved, participants, who, reported, having, strong, feelings, about, the, candidates, they, were, shown, apparently, contradictory, pairs, of, statements, either, from, republican, candidate, george, w, bush, democratic, candidate, john, kerry, or, a, politically, neutral, public, figure, they, were, also, given, further, statements, that, made, the, apparent, contradiction, seem, reasonable, from, these, three, pieces, of, information, they, had, to, decide, whether, each, individual, s, statements, were, inconsistent, 1948, there, were, strong, differences, in, these, evaluations, with, participants, much, more, likely, to, interpret, statements, from, the, candidate, they, opposed, as, contradictory, 1951, in, this, experiment, the, participants, made, their, judgments, while, in, a, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, scanner, which, monitored, their, brain, activity, as, participants, evaluated, contradictory, statements, by, their, favored, candidate, emotional, centers, of, their, brains, were, aroused, this, did, not, happen, with, the, statements, by, the, other, figures, the, experimenters, inferred, that, the, different, responses, to, the, statements, were, not, due, to, passive, reasoning, errors, instead, the, participants, were, actively, reducing, the, cognitive, dissonance, induced, by, reading, about, their, favored, candidate, s, irrational, or, hypocritical, behavior, 1956, biases, in, belief, interpretation, are, persistent, regardless, of, intelligence, level, participants, in, an, experiment, took, the, sat, test, a, college, admissions, test, used, in, the, united, states, to, assess, their, intelligence, levels, they, then, read, information, regarding, safety, concerns, for, vehicles, and, the, experimenters, manipulated, the, national, origin, of, the, car, american, participants, provided, their, opinion, if, the, car, should, be, banned, on, a, six, point, scale, where, one, indicated, definitely, yes, and, six, indicated, definitely, no, participants, firstly, evaluated, if, they, would, allow, a, dangerous, german, car, on, american, streets, and, a, dangerous, american, car, on, german, streets, participants, believed, that, the, dangerous, german, car, on, american, streets, should, be, banned, more, quickly, than, the, dangerous, american, car, on, german, streets, there, was, no, difference, among, intelligence, levels, at, the, rate, participants, would, ban, a, car, biased, interpretation, is, not, restricted, to, emotionally, significant, topics, in, another, experiment, participants, were, told, a, story, about, a, theft, they, had, to, rate, the, evidential, importance, of, statements, arguing, either, for, or, against, a, particular, character, being, responsible, when, they, hypothesized, that, character, s, guilt, they, rated, statements, supporting, that, hypothesis, as, more, important, than, conflicting, statements, people, may, remember, evidence, selectively, to, reinforce, their, expectations, even, if, they, gather, and, interpret, evidence, in, a, neutral, manner, this, effect, is, called, selective, recall, confirmatory, memory, or, access, biased, memory, psychological, theories, differ, in, their, predictions, about, selective, recall, schema, theory, predicts, that, information, matching, prior, expectations, will, be, more, easily, stored, and, recalled, than, information, that, does, not, match, some, alternative, approaches, say, that, surprising, information, stands, out, and, so, is, memorable, predictions, from, both, these, theories, have, been, confirmed, in, different, experimental, contexts, with, no, theory, winning, outright, in, one, study, participants, read, a, profile, of, a, woman, which, described, a, mix, of, introverted, and, extroverted, behaviors, they, later, had, to, recall, examples, of, her, introversion, and, extroversion, one, group, was, told, this, was, to, assess, the, woman, for, a, job, as, a, librarian, while, a, second, group, were, told, it, was, for, a, job, in, real, estate, sales, there, was, a, significant, difference, between, what, these, two, groups, recalled, with, the, librarian, group, recalling, more, examples, of, introversion, and, the, sales, groups, recalling, more, extroverted, behavior, a, selective, memory, effect, has, also, been, shown, in, experiments, that, manipulate, the, desirability, of, personality, types, in, one, of, these, a, group, of, participants, were, shown, evidence, that, extroverted, people, are, more, successful, than, introverts, another, group, were, told, the, opposite, in, a, subsequent, apparently, unrelated, study, participants, were, asked, to, recall, events, from, their, lives, in, which, they, had, been, either, introverted, or, extroverted, each, group, of, participants, provided, more, memories, connecting, themselves, with, the, more, desirable, personality, type, and, recalled, those, memories, more, quickly, changes, in, emotional, states, can, also, influence, memory, recall, participants, rated, how, they, felt, when, they, had, first, learned, that, o, j, simpson, had, been, acquitted, of, murder, charges, they, described, their, emotional, reactions, and, confidence, regarding, the, verdict, one, week, two, months, and, one, year, after, the, trial, results, indicated, that, participants, assessments, for, simpson, s, guilt, changed, over, time, the, more, that, participants, opinion, of, the, verdict, had, changed, the, less, stable, were, the, participant, s, memories, regarding, their, initial, emotional, reactions, when, participants, recalled, their, initial, emotional, reactions, two, months, and, a, year, later, past, appraisals, closely, resembled, current, appraisals, of, emotion, people, demonstrate, sizable, myside, bias, when, discussing, their, opinions, on, controversial, topics, memory, recall, and, construction, of, experiences, undergo, revision, in, relation, to, corresponding, emotional, states, myside, bias, has, been, shown, to, influence, the, accuracy, of, memory, recall, in, an, experiment, widows, and, widowers, rated, the, intensity, of, their, experienced, grief, six, months, and, five, years, after, the, deaths, of, their, spouses, participants, noted, a, higher, experience, of, grief, at, six, months, rather, than, at, five, years, yet, when, the, participants, were, asked, after, five, years, how, they, had, felt, six, months, after, the, death, of, their, significant, other, the, intensity, of, grief, participants, recalled, was, highly, correlated, with, their, current, level, of, grief, individuals, appear, to, utilize, their, current, emotional, states, to, analyze, how, they, must, have, felt, when, experiencing, past, events, emotional, memories, are, reconstructed, by, current, emotional, states, one, study, showed, how, selective, memory, can, maintain, belief, in, extrasensory, perception, esp, believers, and, disbelievers, were, each, shown, descriptions, of, esp, experiments, half, of, each, group, were, told, that, the, experimental, results, supported, the, existence, of, esp, while, the, others, were, told, they, did, not, in, a, subsequent, test, participants, recalled, the, material, accurately, apart, from, believers, who, had, read, the, non, supportive, evidence, this, group, remembered, significantly, less, information, and, some, of, them, incorrectly, remembered, the, results, as, supporting, esp, myside, bias, was, once, believed, to, be, correlated, with, intelligence, however, studies, have, shown, that, myside, bias, can, be, more, influenced, by, ability, to, rationally, think, as, opposed, to, level, of, intelligence, myside, bias, can, cause, an, inability, to, effectively, and, logically, evaluate, the, opposite, side, of, an, argument, studies, have, stated, that, myside, bias, is, an, absence, of, active, open, mindedness, meaning, the, active, search, for, why, an, initial, idea, may, be, wrong, typically, myside, bias, is, operationalized, in, empirical, studies, as, the, quantity, of, evidence, used, in, support, of, their, side, in, comparison, to, the, opposite, side, a, study, has, found, individual, differences, in, myside, bias, this, study, investigates, individual, differences, that, are, acquired, through, learning, in, a, cultural, context, and, are, mutable, the, researcher, found, important, individual, difference, in, argumentation, studies, have, suggested, that, individual, differences, such, as, deductive, reasoning, ability, ability, to, overcome, belief, bias, epistemological, understanding, and, thinking, disposition, are, significant, predictors, of, the, reasoning, and, generating, arguments, counterarguments, and, rebuttals, a, study, by, christopher, wolfe, and, anne, britt, also, investigated, how, participants, views, of, what, makes, a, good, argument, can, be, a, source, of, myside, bias, that, influences, the, way, a, person, formulates, their, own, arguments, the, study, investigated, individual, differences, of, argumentation, schema, and, asked, participants, to, write, essays, the, participants, were, randomly, assigned, to, write, essays, either, for, or, against, their, preferred, side, of, an, argument, and, were, given, research, instructions, that, took, either, a, balanced, or, an, unrestricted, approach, the, balanced, research, instructions, directed, participants, to, create, a, balanced, argument, i, e, that, included, both, pros, and, cons, the, unrestricted, research, instructions, included, nothing, on, how, to, create, the, argument, overall, the, results, revealed, that, the, balanced, research, instructions, significantly, increased, the, incidence, of, opposing, information, in, arguments, these, data, also, reveal, that, personal, belief, is, not, a, source, of, myside, bias, however, that, those, participants, who, believe, that, a, good, argument, is, one, that, is, based, on, facts, are, more, likely, to, exhibit, myside, bias, than, other, participants, this, evidence, is, consistent, with, the, claims, proposed, in, baron, s, article, that, people, s, opinions, about, what, makes, good, thinking, can, influence, how, arguments, are, generated, before, psychological, research, on, confirmation, bias, the, phenomenon, had, been, observed, throughout, history, beginning, with, the, greek, historian, thucydides, c, 460, bc, c, 395, bc, who, wrote, of, misguided, reason, in, the, peloponnesian, war, for, it, is, a, habit, of, mankind, to, entrust, to, careless, hope, what, they, long, for, and, to, use, sovereign, reason, to, thrust, aside, what, they, do, not, fancy, italian, poet, dante, alighieri, 1265, 1321, noted, it, in, the, divine, comedy, in, which, st, thomas, aquinas, cautions, dante, upon, meeting, in, paradise, opinion, hasty, often, can, incline, to, the, wrong, side, and, then, affection, for, one, s, own, opinion, binds, confines, the, mind, ibn, khaldun, noticed, the, same, effect, in, his, muqaddimah, untruth, naturally, afflicts, historical, information, there, are, various, reasons, that, make, this, unavoidable, one, of, them, is, partisanship, for, opinions, and, schools, if, the, soul, is, infected, with, partisanship, for, a, particular, opinion, or, sect, it, accepts, without, a, moment, s, hesitation, the, information, that, is, agreeable, to, it, prejudice, and, partisanship, obscure, the, critical, faculty, and, preclude, critical, investigation, the, result, is, that, falsehoods, are, accepted, and, transmitted, in, the, novum, organum, english, philosopher, and, scientist, francis, bacon, 1561, 1626, noted, that, biased, assessment, of, evidence, drove, all, superstitions, whether, in, astrology, dreams, omens, divine, judgments, or, the, like, he, wrote, the, human, understanding, when, it, has, once, adopted, an, opinion, draws, all, things, else, to, support, and, agree, with, it, and, though, there, be, a, greater, number, and, weight, of, instances, to, be, found, on, the, other, side, yet, these, it, either, neglects, or, despises, or, else, by, some, distinction, sets, aside, or, rejects, in, the, second, volume, of, his, the, world, as, will, and, representation, 1844, german, philosopher, arthur, schopenhauer, observed, that, an, adopted, hypothesis, gives, us, lynx, eyes, for, everything, that, confirms, it, and, makes, us, blind, to, everything, that, contradicts, it, in, his, essay, 1897, what, is, art, russian, novelist, leo, tolstoy, wrote, i, know, that, most, men, not, only, those, considered, clever, but, even, those, who, are, very, clever, and, capable, of, understanding, most, difficult, scientific, mathematical, or, philosophic, problems, can, very, seldom, discern, even, the, simplest, and, most, obvious, truth, if, it, be, such, as, to, oblige, them, to, admit, the, falsity, of, conclusions, they, have, formed, perhaps, with, much, difficulty, conclusions, of, which, they, are, proud, which, they, have, taught, to, others, and, on, which, they, have, built, their, lives, in, his, essay, 1894, the, kingdom, of, god, is, within, you, tolstoy, had, earlier, written, the, most, difficult, subjects, can, be, explained, to, the, most, slow, witted, man, if, he, has, not, formed, any, idea, of, them, already, but, the, simplest, thing, cannot, be, made, clear, to, the, most, intelligent, man, if, he, is, firmly, persuaded, that, he, knows, already, without, a, shadow, of, doubt, what, is, laid, before, him, in, peter, wason, s, initial, experiment, published, in, 1960, which, does, not, mention, the, term, confirmation, bias, he, repeatedly, challenged, participants, to, identify, a, rule, applying, to, triples, of, numbers, they, were, told, that, 2, 4, 6, fits, the, rule, they, generated, triples, and, the, experimenter, told, them, whether, each, triple, conformed, to, the, rule, 179, the, actual, rule, was, simply, any, ascending, sequence, but, participants, had, great, difficulty, in, finding, it, often, announcing, rules, that, were, far, more, specific, such, as, the, middle, number, is, the, average, of, the, first, and, last, the, participants, seemed, to, test, only, positive, examples, triples, that, obeyed, their, hypothesized, rule, for, example, if, they, thought, the, rule, was, each, number, is, two, greater, than, its, predecessor, they, would, offer, a, triple, that, fitted, confirmed, this, rule, such, as, 11, 13, 15, rather, than, a, triple, that, violated, falsified, it, such, as, 11, 12, 19, wason, interpreted, his, results, as, showing, a, preference, for, confirmation, over, falsification, hence, he, coined, the, term, confirmation, bias, wason, also, used, confirmation, bias, to, explain, the, results, of, his, selection, task, experiment, participants, repeatedly, performed, badly, on, various, forms, of, this, test, in, most, cases, ignoring, information, that, could, potentially, refute, falsify, the, specified, rule, klayman, and, ha, s, 1987, paper, argues, that, the, wason, experiments, do, not, actually, demonstrate, a, bias, towards, confirmation, but, instead, a, tendency, to, make, tests, consistent, with, the, working, hypothesis, they, called, this, the, positive, test, strategy, this, strategy, is, an, example, of, a, heuristic, a, reasoning, shortcut, that, is, imperfect, but, easy, to, compute, klayman, and, ha, used, bayesian, probability, and, information, theory, as, their, standard, of, hypothesis, testing, rather, than, the, falsificationism, used, by, wason, according, to, these, ideas, each, answer, to, a, question, yields, a, different, amount, of, information, which, depends, on, the, person, s, prior, beliefs, thus, a, scientific, test, of, a, hypothesis, is, one, that, is, expected, to, produce, the, most, information, since, the, information, content, depends, on, initial, probabilities, a, positive, test, can, either, be, highly, informative, or, uninformative, klayman, and, ha, argued, that, when, people, think, about, realistic, problems, they, are, looking, for, a, specific, answer, with, a, small, initial, probability, in, this, case, positive, tests, are, usually, more, informative, than, negative, tests, however, in, wason, s, rule, discovery, task, the, answer, three, numbers, in, ascending, order, is, very, broad, so, positive, tests, are, unlikely, to, yield, informative, answers, klayman, and, ha, supported, their, analysis, by, citing, an, experiment, that, used, the, labels, dax, and, med, in, place, of, fits, the, rule, and, doesn, t, fit, the, rule, this, avoided, implying, that, the, aim, was, to, find, a, low, probability, rule, participants, had, much, more, success, with, this, version, of, the, experiment, in, light, of, this, and, other, critiques, the, focus, of, research, moved, away, from, confirmation, versus, falsification, of, an, hypothesis, to, examining, whether, people, test, hypotheses, in, an, informative, way, or, an, uninformative, but, positive, way, the, search, for, true, confirmation, bias, led, psychologists, to, look, at, a, wider, range, of, effects, in, how, people, process, information, there, are, currently, three, main, information, processing, explanations, of, confirmation, bias, plus, a, recent, addition, according, to, robert, maccoun, most, biased, evidence, processing, occurs, through, a, combination, of, cold, cognitive, and, hot, motivated, mechanisms, cognitive, explanations, for, confirmation, bias, are, based, on, limitations, in, people, s, ability, to, handle, complex, tasks, and, the, shortcuts, called, heuristics, that, they, use, for, example, people, may, judge, the, reliability, of, evidence, by, using, the, availability, heuristic, that, is, how, readily, a, particular, idea, comes, to, mind, it, is, also, possible, that, people, can, only, focus, on, one, thought, at, a, time, so, find, it, difficult, to, test, alternative, hypotheses, in, parallel, 198, 199, another, heuristic, is, the, positive, test, strategy, identified, by, klayman, and, ha, in, which, people, test, a, hypothesis, by, examining, cases, where, they, expect, a, property, or, event, to, occur, this, heuristic, avoids, the, difficult, or, impossible, task, of, working, out, how, diagnostic, each, possible, question, will, be, however, it, is, not, universally, reliable, so, people, can, overlook, challenges, to, their, existing, beliefs, 200, motivational, explanations, involve, an, effect, of, desire, on, belief, 197, it, is, known, that, people, prefer, positive, thoughts, over, negative, ones, in, a, number, of, ways, this, is, called, the, pollyanna, principle, applied, to, arguments, or, sources, of, evidence, this, could, explain, why, desired, conclusions, are, more, likely, to, be, believed, true, according, to, experiments, that, manipulate, the, desirability, of, the, conclusion, people, demand, a, high, standard, of, evidence, for, unpalatable, ideas, and, a, low, standard, for, preferred, ideas, in, other, words, they, ask, can, i, believe, this, for, some, suggestions, and, must, i, believe, this, for, others, although, consistency, is, a, desirable, feature, of, attitudes, an, excessive, drive, for, consistency, is, another, potential, source, of, bias, because, it, may, prevent, people, from, neutrally, evaluating, new, surprising, information, social, psychologist, ziva, kunda, combines, the, cognitive, and, motivational, theories, arguing, that, motivation, creates, the, bias, but, cognitive, factors, determine, the, size, of, the, effect, 198, explanations, in, terms, of, cost, benefit, analysis, assume, that, people, do, not, just, test, hypotheses, in, a, disinterested, way, but, assess, the, costs, of, different, errors, using, ideas, from, evolutionary, psychology, james, friedrich, suggests, that, people, do, not, primarily, aim, at, truth, in, testing, hypotheses, but, try, to, avoid, the, most, costly, errors, for, example, employers, might, ask, one, sided, questions, in, job, interviews, because, they, are, focused, on, weeding, out, unsuitable, candidates, yaacov, trope, and, akiva, liberman, s, refinement, of, this, theory, assumes, that, people, compare, the, two, different, kinds, of, error, accepting, a, false, hypothesis, or, rejecting, a, true, hypothesis, for, instance, someone, who, underestimates, a, friend, s, honesty, might, treat, him, or, her, suspiciously, and, so, undermine, the, friendship, overestimating, the, friend, s, honesty, may, also, be, costly, but, less, so, in, this, case, it, would, be, rational, to, seek, evaluate, or, remember, evidence, of, their, honesty, in, a, biased, way, when, someone, gives, an, initial, impression, of, being, introverted, or, extroverted, questions, that, match, that, impression, come, across, as, more, empathic, this, suggests, that, when, talking, to, someone, who, seems, to, be, an, introvert, it, is, a, sign, of, better, social, skills, to, ask, do, you, feel, awkward, in, social, situations, rather, than, do, you, like, noisy, parties, the, connection, between, confirmation, bias, and, social, skills, was, corroborated, by, a, study, of, how, college, students, get, to, know, other, people, highly, self, monitoring, students, who, are, more, sensitive, to, their, environment, and, to, social, norms, asked, more, matching, questions, when, interviewing, a, high, status, staff, member, than, when, getting, to, know, fellow, students, psychologists, jennifer, lerner, and, philip, tetlock, distinguish, two, different, kinds, of, thinking, process, exploratory, thought, neutrally, considers, multiple, points, of, view, and, tries, to, anticipate, all, possible, objections, to, a, particular, position, while, confirmatory, thought, seeks, to, justify, a, specific, point, of, view, lerner, and, tetlock, say, that, when, people, expect, to, justify, their, position, to, others, whose, views, they, already, know, they, will, tend, to, adopt, a, similar, position, to, those, people, and, then, use, confirmatory, thought, to, bolster, their, own, credibility, however, if, the, external, parties, are, overly, aggressive, or, critical, people, will, disengage, from, thought, altogether, and, simply, assert, their, personal, opinions, without, justification, lerner, and, tetlock, say, that, people, only, push, themselves, to, think, critically, and, logically, when, they, know, in, advance, they, will, need, to, explain, themselves, to, others, who, are, well, informed, genuinely, interested, in, the, truth, and, whose, views, they, do, not, already, know, because, those, conditions, rarely, exist, they, argue, most, people, are, using, confirmatory, thought, most, of, the, time, developmental, psychologist, eve, whitmore, has, argued, that, beliefs, and, biases, involved, in, confirmation, bias, have, their, roots, in, childhood, coping, through, make, believe, which, becomes, the, basis, for, more, complex, forms, of, self, deception, and, illusion, into, adulthood, the, friction, brought, on, by, questioning, as, an, adolescent, with, developing, critical, thinking, can, lead, to, the, rationalization, of, false, beliefs, and, the, habit, of, such, rationalization, can, become, unconscious, over, the, years, in, social, media, confirmation, bias, is, amplified, by, the, use, of, filter, bubbles, or, algorithmic, editing, which, displays, to, individuals, only, information, they, are, likely, to, agree, with, while, excluding, opposing, views, some, have, argued, that, confirmation, bias, is, the, reason, why, society, can, never, escape, from, filter, bubbles, because, individuals, are, psychologically, hardwired, to, seek, information, that, agrees, with, their, preexisting, values, and, beliefs, others, have, further, argued, that, the, mixture, of, the, two, is, degrading, democracy, claiming, that, this, algorithmic, editing, removes, diverse, viewpoints, and, information, and, that, unless, filter, bubble, algorithms, are, removed, voters, will, be, unable, to, make, fully, informed, political, decisions, the, rise, of, social, media, has, contributed, greatly, to, the, rapid, spread, of, fake, news, that, is, false, and, misleading, information, that, is, presented, as, credible, news, from, a, seemingly, reliable, source, confirmation, bias, selecting, or, reinterpreting, evidence, to, support, one, s, beliefs, is, one, of, three, main, hurdles, cited, as, to, why, critical, thinking, goes, astray, in, these, circumstances, the, other, two, are, shortcut, heuristics, when, overwhelmed, or, short, of, time, people, rely, on, simple, rules, such, as, group, consensus, or, trusting, an, expert, or, role, model, and, social, goals, social, motivation, or, peer, pressure, can, interfere, with, objective, analysis, of, facts, at, hand, in, combating, the, spread, of, fake, news, social, media, sites, have, considered, turning, toward, digital, nudging, this, can, currently, be, done, in, two, different, forms, of, nudging, this, includes, nudging, of, information, and, nudging, of, presentation, nudging, of, information, entails, social, media, sites, providing, a, disclaimer, or, label, questioning, or, warning, users, of, the, validity, of, the, source, while, nudging, of, presentation, includes, exposing, users, to, new, information, which, they, may, not, have, sought, out, but, could, introduce, them, to, viewpoints, that, may, combat, their, own, confirmation, biases, a, distinguishing, feature, of, scientific, thinking, is, the, search, for, confirming, or, supportive, evidence, inductive, reasoning, as, well, as, falsifying, evidence, deductive, reasoning, many, times, in, the, history, of, science, scientists, have, resisted, new, discoveries, by, selectively, interpreting, or, ignoring, unfavorable, data, 192, 194, several, studies, have, shown, that, scientists, rate, studies, that, report, findings, consistent, with, their, prior, beliefs, more, favorably, than, studies, reporting, findings, inconsistent, with, their, previous, beliefs, however, assuming, that, the, research, question, is, relevant, the, experimental, design, adequate, and, the, data, are, clearly, and, comprehensively, described, the, empirical, data, obtained, should, be, important, to, the, scientific, community, and, should, not, be, viewed, prejudicially, regardless, of, whether, they, conform, to, current, theoretical, predictions, in, practice, researchers, may, misunderstand, misinterpret, or, not, read, at, all, studies, that, contradict, their, preconceptions, or, wrongly, cite, them, anyway, as, if, they, actually, supported, their, claims, further, confirmation, biases, can, sustain, scientific, theories, or, research, programs, in, the, face, of, inadequate, or, even, contradictory, evidence, the, discipline, of, parapsychology, is, often, cited, as, an, example, an, experimenter, s, confirmation, bias, can, potentially, affect, which, data, are, reported, data, that, conflict, with, the, experimenter, s, expectations, may, be, more, readily, discarded, as, unreliable, producing, the, so, called, file, drawer, effect, to, combat, this, tendency, scientific, training, teaches, ways, to, prevent, bias, for, example, experimental, design, of, randomized, controlled, trials, coupled, with, their, systematic, review, aims, to, minimize, sources, of, bias, the, social, process, of, peer, review, aims, to, mitigate, the, effect, of, individual, scientists, biases, even, though, the, peer, review, process, itself, may, be, susceptible, to, such, biases, confirmation, bias, may, thus, be, especially, harmful, to, objective, evaluations, regarding, nonconforming, results, since, biased, individuals, may, regard, opposing, evidence, to, be, weak, in, principle, and, give, little, serious, thought, to, revising, their, beliefs, scientific, innovators, often, meet, with, resistance, from, the, scientific, community, and, research, presenting, controversial, results, frequently, receives, harsh, peer, review, confirmation, bias, can, lead, investors, to, be, overconfident, ignoring, evidence, that, their, strategies, will, lose, money, in, studies, of, political, stock, markets, investors, made, more, profit, when, they, resisted, bias, for, example, participants, who, interpreted, a, candidate, s, debate, performance, in, a, neutral, rather, than, partisan, way, were, more, likely, to, profit, to, combat, the, effect, of, confirmation, bias, investors, can, try, to, adopt, a, contrary, viewpoint, for, the, sake, of, argument, in, one, technique, they, imagine, that, their, investments, have, collapsed, and, ask, themselves, why, this, might, happen, cognitive, biases, are, important, variables, in, clinical, decision, making, by, medical, general, practitioners, gps, and, medical, specialists, two, important, ones, are, confirmation, bias, and, the, overlapping, availability, bias, a, gp, may, make, a, diagnosis, early, on, during, an, examination, and, then, seek, confirming, evidence, rather, than, falsifying, evidence, this, cognitive, error, is, partly, caused, by, the, availability, of, evidence, about, the, supposed, disorder, being, diagnosed, for, example, the, client, may, have, mentioned, the, disorder, or, the, gp, may, have, recently, read, a, much, discussed, paper, about, the, disorder, the, basis, of, this, cognitive, shortcut, or, heuristic, termed, anchoring, is, that, the, doctor, does, not, consider, multiple, possibilities, based, on, evidence, but, prematurely, latches, on, or, anchors, to, a, single, cause, in, emergency, medicine, because, of, time, pressure, there, is, a, high, density, of, decision, making, and, shortcuts, are, frequently, applied, the, potential, failure, rate, of, these, cognitive, decisions, needs, to, be, managed, by, education, about, the, 30, or, more, cognitive, biases, that, can, occur, so, as, to, set, in, place, proper, debiasing, strategies, confirmation, bias, may, also, cause, doctors, to, perform, unnecessary, medical, procedures, due, to, pressure, from, adamant, patients, raymond, nickerson, a, psychologist, blames, confirmation, bias, for, the, ineffective, medical, procedures, that, were, used, for, centuries, before, the, arrival, of, scientific, medicine, 192, if, a, patient, recovered, medical, authorities, counted, the, treatment, as, successful, rather, than, looking, for, alternative, explanations, such, as, that, the, disease, had, run, its, natural, course, biased, assimilation, is, a, factor, in, the, modern, appeal, of, alternative, medicine, whose, proponents, are, swayed, by, positive, anecdotal, evidence, but, treat, scientific, evidence, hyper, critically, cognitive, therapy, was, developed, by, aaron, t, beck, in, the, early, 1960s, and, has, become, a, popular, approach, according, to, beck, biased, information, processing, is, a, factor, in, depression, his, approach, teaches, people, to, treat, evidence, impartially, rather, than, selectively, reinforcing, negative, outlooks, phobias, and, hypochondria, have, also, been, shown, to, involve, confirmation, bias, for, threatening, information, nickerson, argues, that, reasoning, in, judicial, and, political, contexts, is, sometimes, subconsciously, biased, favoring, conclusions, that, judges, juries, or, governments, have, already, committed, to, 191, 193, since, the, evidence, in, a, jury, trial, can, be, complex, and, jurors, often, reach, decisions, about, the, verdict, early, on, it, is, reasonable, to, expect, an, attitude, polarization, effect, the, prediction, that, jurors, will, become, more, extreme, in, their, views, as, they, see, more, evidence, has, been, borne, out, in, experiments, with, mock, trials, both, inquisitorial, and, adversarial, criminal, justice, systems, are, affected, by, confirmation, bias, confirmation, bias, can, be, a, factor, in, creating, or, extending, conflicts, from, emotionally, charged, debates, to, wars, by, interpreting, the, evidence, in, their, favor, each, opposing, party, can, become, overconfident, that, it, is, in, the, stronger, position, on, the, other, hand, confirmation, bias, can, result, in, people, ignoring, or, misinterpreting, the, signs, of, an, imminent, or, incipient, conflict, for, example, psychologists, stuart, sutherland, and, thomas, kida, have, each, argued, that, u, s, navy, admiral, husband, e, kimmel, showed, confirmation, bias, when, playing, down, the, first, signs, of, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, a, two, decade, study, of, political, pundits, by, philip, e, tetlock, found, that, on, the, whole, their, predictions, were, not, much, better, than, chance, tetlock, divided, experts, into, foxes, who, maintained, multiple, hypotheses, and, hedgehogs, who, were, more, dogmatic, in, general, the, hedgehogs, were, much, less, accurate, tetlock, blamed, their, failure, on, confirmation, bias, and, specifically, on, their, inability, to, make, use, of, new, information, that, contradicted, their, existing, theories, in, police, investigations, a, detective, may, identify, a, suspect, early, in, an, investigation, but, then, sometimes, largely, seek, supporting, or, confirming, evidence, ignoring, or, downplaying, falsifying, evidence, social, psychologists, have, identified, two, tendencies, in, the, way, people, seek, or, interpret, information, about, themselves, self, verification, is, the, drive, to, reinforce, the, existing, self, image, and, self, enhancement, is, the, drive, to, seek, positive, feedback, both, are, served, by, confirmation, biases, in, experiments, where, people, are, given, feedback, that, conflicts, with, their, self, image, they, are, less, likely, to, attend, to, it, or, remember, it, than, when, given, self, verifying, feedback, they, reduce, the, impact, of, such, information, by, interpreting, it, as, unreliable, similar, experiments, have, found, a, preference, for, positive, feedback, and, the, people, who, give, it, over, negative, feedback, confirmation, bias, can, play, a, key, role, in, the, propagation, of, mass, delusions, witch, trials, are, frequently, cited, as, an, example, for, another, example, in, the, seattle, windshield, pitting, epidemic, there, seemed, to, be, a, pitting, epidemic, in, which, windshields, were, damaged, due, to, an, unknown, cause, as, news, of, the, apparent, wave, of, damage, spread, more, and, more, people, checked, their, windshields, discovered, that, their, windshields, too, had, been, damaged, thus, confirming, belief, in, the, supposed, epidemic, in, fact, the, windshields, were, previously, damaged, but, the, damage, went, unnoticed, until, people, checked, their, windshields, as, the, delusion, spread, one, factor, in, the, appeal, of, alleged, psychic, readings, is, that, listeners, apply, a, confirmation, bias, which, fits, the, psychic, s, statements, to, their, own, lives, by, making, a, large, number, of, ambiguous, statements, in, each, sitting, the, psychic, gives, the, client, more, opportunities, to, find, a, match, this, is, one, of, the, techniques, of, cold, reading, with, which, a, psychic, can, deliver, a, subjectively, impressive, reading, without, any, prior, information, about, the, client, investigator, james, randi, compared, the, transcript, of, a, reading, to, the, client, s, report, of, what, the, psychic, had, said, and, found, that, the, client, showed, a, strong, selective, recall, of, the, hits, as, a, striking, illustration, of, confirmation, bias, in, the, real, world, nickerson, mentions, numerological, pyramidology, the, practice, of, finding, meaning, in, the, proportions, of, the, egyptian, pyramids, 190, there, are, many, different, length, measurements, that, can, be, made, of, for, example, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, and, many, ways, to, combine, or, manipulate, them, hence, it, is, almost, inevitable, that, people, who, look, at, these, numbers, selectively, will, find, superficially, impressive, correspondences, for, example, with, the, dimensions, of, the, earth, 190, unconscious, cognitive, bias, including, confirmation, bias, in, job, recruitment, affects, hiring, decisions, and, can, potentially, prohibit, a, diverse, and, inclusive, workplace, there, are, a, variety, of, unconscious, biases, that, affects, recruitment, decisions, but, confirmation, bias, is, one, of, the, major, ones, especially, during, the, interview, stage, the, interviewer, will, often, select, a, candidate, that, confirms, their, own, beliefs, even, though, other, candidates, are, equally, or, better, qualified, when, people, with, opposing, views, interpret, new, information, in, a, biased, way, their, views, can, move, even, further, apart, this, is, called, attitude, polarization, the, effect, was, demonstrated, by, an, experiment, that, involved, drawing, a, series, of, red, and, black, balls, from, one, of, two, concealed, bingo, baskets, participants, knew, that, one, basket, contained, 60, percent, black, and, 40, percent, red, balls, the, other, 40, percent, black, and, 60, percent, red, the, experimenters, looked, at, what, happened, when, balls, of, alternating, color, were, drawn, in, turn, a, sequence, that, does, not, favor, either, basket, after, each, ball, was, drawn, participants, in, one, group, were, asked, to, state, out, loud, their, judgments, of, the, probability, that, the, balls, were, being, drawn, from, one, or, the, other, basket, these, participants, tended, to, grow, more, confident, with, each, successive, draw, whether, they, initially, thought, the, basket, with, 60, percent, black, balls, or, the, one, with, 60, percent, red, balls, was, the, more, likely, source, their, estimate, of, the, probability, increased, another, group, of, participants, were, asked, to, state, probability, estimates, only, at, the, end, of, a, sequence, of, drawn, balls, rather, than, after, each, ball, they, did, not, show, the, polarization, effect, suggesting, that, it, does, not, necessarily, occur, when, people, simply, hold, opposing, positions, but, rather, when, they, openly, commit, to, them, a, less, abstract, study, was, the, stanford, biased, interpretation, experiment, in, which, participants, with, strong, opinions, about, the, death, penalty, read, about, mixed, experimental, evidence, twenty, three, percent, of, the, participants, reported, that, their, views, had, become, more, extreme, and, this, self, reported, shift, correlated, strongly, with, their, initial, attitudes, in, later, experiments, participants, also, reported, their, opinions, becoming, more, extreme, in, response, to, ambiguous, information, however, comparisons, of, their, attitudes, before, and, after, the, new, evidence, showed, no, significant, change, suggesting, that, the, self, reported, changes, might, not, be, real, based, on, these, experiments, deanna, kuhn, and, joseph, lao, concluded, that, polarization, is, a, real, phenomenon, but, far, from, inevitable, only, happening, in, a, small, minority, of, cases, and, it, was, prompted, not, only, by, considering, mixed, evidence, but, by, merely, thinking, about, the, topic, charles, taber, and, milton, lodge, argued, that, the, stanford, team, s, result, had, been, hard, to, replicate, because, the, arguments, used, in, later, experiments, were, too, abstract, or, confusing, to, evoke, an, emotional, response, the, taber, and, lodge, study, used, the, emotionally, charged, topics, of, gun, control, and, affirmative, action, they, measured, the, attitudes, of, their, participants, towards, these, issues, before, and, after, reading, arguments, on, each, side, of, the, debate, two, groups, of, participants, showed, attitude, polarization, those, with, strong, prior, opinions, and, those, who, were, politically, knowledgeable, in, part, of, this, study, participants, chose, which, information, sources, to, read, from, a, list, prepared, by, the, experimenters, for, example, they, could, read, arguments, on, gun, control, from, the, national, rifle, association, of, america, and, the, brady, anti, handgun, coalition, even, when, instructed, to, be, even, handed, participants, were, more, likely, to, read, arguments, that, supported, their, existing, attitudes, than, arguments, that, did, not, this, biased, search, for, information, correlated, well, with, the, polarization, effect, the, backfire, effect, is, a, name, for, the, finding, that, given, evidence, against, their, beliefs, people, can, reject, the, evidence, and, believe, even, more, strongly, the, phrase, was, coined, by, brendan, nyhan, and, jason, reifler, in, 2010, however, subsequent, research, has, since, failed, to, replicate, findings, supporting, the, backfire, effect, one, study, conducted, out, of, the, ohio, state, university, and, george, washington, university, studied, 10, 100, participants, with, 52, different, issues, expected, to, trigger, a, backfire, effect, while, the, findings, did, conclude, that, individuals, are, reluctant, to, embrace, facts, that, contradict, their, already, held, ideology, no, cases, of, backfire, were, detected, the, backfire, effect, has, since, been, noted, to, be, a, rare, phenomenon, rather, than, a, common, occurrence, compare, the, boomerang, effect, beliefs, can, survive, potent, logical, or, empirical, challenges, they, can, survive, and, even, be, bolstered, by, evidence, that, most, uncommitted, observers, would, agree, logically, demands, some, weakening, of, such, beliefs, they, can, even, survive, the, total, destruction, of, their, original, evidential, bases, lee, ross, and, craig, anderson, confirmation, biases, provide, one, plausible, explanation, for, the, persistence, of, beliefs, when, the, initial, evidence, for, them, is, removed, or, when, they, have, been, sharply, contradicted, 187, this, belief, perseverance, effect, has, been, first, demonstrated, experimentally, by, festinger, riecken, and, schachter, these, psychologists, spent, time, with, a, cult, whose, members, were, convinced, that, the, world, would, end, on, 21, december, 1954, after, the, prediction, failed, most, believers, still, clung, to, their, faith, their, book, describing, this, research, is, aptly, named, when, prophecy, fails, the, term, belief, perseverance, however, was, coined, in, a, series, of, experiments, using, what, is, called, the, debriefing, paradigm, participants, read, fake, evidence, for, a, hypothesis, their, attitude, change, is, measured, then, the, fakery, is, exposed, in, detail, their, attitudes, are, then, measured, once, more, to, see, if, their, belief, returns, to, its, previous, level, a, common, finding, is, that, at, least, some, of, the, initial, belief, remains, even, after, a, full, debriefing, in, one, experiment, participants, had, to, distinguish, between, real, and, fake, suicide, notes, the, feedback, was, random, some, were, told, they, had, done, well, while, others, were, told, they, had, performed, badly, even, after, being, fully, debriefed, participants, were, still, influenced, by, the, feedback, they, still, thought, they, were, better, or, worse, than, average, at, that, kind, of, task, depending, on, what, they, had, initially, been, told, in, another, study, participants, read, job, performance, ratings, of, two, firefighters, along, with, their, responses, to, a, risk, aversion, test, this, fictional, data, was, arranged, to, show, either, a, negative, or, positive, association, some, participants, were, told, that, a, risk, taking, firefighter, did, better, while, others, were, told, they, did, less, well, than, a, risk, averse, colleague, even, if, these, two, case, studies, were, true, they, would, have, been, scientifically, poor, evidence, for, a, conclusion, about, firefighters, in, general, however, the, participants, found, them, subjectively, persuasive, when, the, case, studies, were, shown, to, be, fictional, participants, belief, in, a, link, diminished, but, around, half, of, the, original, effect, remained, follow, up, interviews, established, that, the, participants, had, understood, the, debriefing, and, taken, it, seriously, participants, seemed, to, trust, the, debriefing, but, regarded, the, discredited, information, as, irrelevant, to, their, personal, belief, the, continued, influence, effect, is, the, tendency, for, misinformation, to, continue, to, influence, memory, and, reasoning, about, an, event, despite, the, misinformation, having, been, retracted, or, corrected, this, occurs, even, when, the, individual, believes, the, correction, experiments, have, shown, that, information, is, weighted, more, strongly, when, it, appears, early, in, a, series, even, when, the, order, is, unimportant, for, example, people, form, a, more, positive, impression, of, someone, described, as, intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious, than, when, they, are, given, the, same, words, in, reverse, order, this, irrational, primacy, effect, is, independent, of, the, primacy, effect, in, memory, in, which, the, earlier, items, in, a, series, leave, a, stronger, memory, trace, biased, interpretation, offers, an, explanation, for, this, effect, seeing, the, initial, evidence, people, form, a, working, hypothesis, that, affects, how, they, interpret, the, rest, of, the, information, 187, one, demonstration, of, irrational, primacy, used, colored, chips, supposedly, drawn, from, two, urns, participants, were, told, the, color, distributions, of, the, urns, and, had, to, estimate, the, probability, of, a, chip, being, drawn, from, one, of, them, in, fact, the, colors, appeared, in, a, prearranged, order, the, first, thirty, draws, favored, one, urn, and, the, next, thirty, favored, the, other, 187, the, series, as, a, whole, was, neutral, so, rationally, the, two, urns, were, equally, likely, however, after, sixty, draws, participants, favored, the, urn, suggested, by, the, initial, thirty, another, experiment, involved, a, slide, show, of, a, single, object, seen, as, just, a, blur, at, first, and, in, slightly, better, focus, with, each, succeeding, slide, after, each, slide, participants, had, to, state, their, best, guess, of, what, the, object, was, participants, whose, early, guesses, were, wrong, persisted, with, those, guesses, even, when, the, picture, was, sufficiently, in, focus, that, the, object, was, readily, recognizable, to, other, people, 187, illusory, correlation, is, the, tendency, to, see, non, existent, correlations, in, a, set, of, data, this, tendency, was, first, demonstrated, in, a, series, of, experiments, in, the, late, 1960s, in, one, experiment, participants, read, a, set, of, psychiatric, case, studies, including, responses, to, the, rorschach, inkblot, test, the, participants, reported, that, the, homosexual, men, in, the, set, were, more, likely, to, report, seeing, buttocks, anuses, or, sexually, ambiguous, figures, in, the, inkblots, in, fact, the, fictional, case, studies, had, been, constructed, so, that, the, homosexual, men, were, no, more, likely, to, report, this, imagery, or, in, one, version, of, the, experiment, were, less, likely, to, report, it, than, heterosexual, men, in, a, survey, a, group, of, experienced, psychoanalysts, reported, the, same, set, of, illusory, associations, with, homosexuality, another, study, recorded, the, symptoms, experienced, by, arthritic, patients, along, with, weather, conditions, over, a, 15, month, period, nearly, all, the, patients, reported, that, their, pains, were, correlated, with, weather, conditions, although, the, real, correlation, was, zero, this, effect, is, a, kind, of, biased, interpretation, in, that, objectively, neutral, or, unfavorable, evidence, is, interpreted, to, support, existing, beliefs, it, is, also, related, to, biases, in, hypothesis, testing, behavior, in, judging, whether, two, events, such, as, illness, and, bad, weather, are, correlated, people, rely, heavily, on, the, number, of, positive, positive, cases, in, this, example, instances, of, both, pain, and, bad, weather, they, pay, relatively, little, attention, to, the, other, kinds, of, observation, of, no, pain, and, or, good, weather, this, parallels, the, reliance, on, positive, tests, in, hypothesis, testing, it, may, also, reflect, selective, recall, in, that, people, may, have, a, sense, that, two, events, are, correlated, because, it, is, easier, to, recall, times, when, they, happened, together
