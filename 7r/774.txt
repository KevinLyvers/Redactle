in, classical, psychoanalytic, theory, the, oedipus, complex, also, spelled, dipus, complex, refers, to, a, son, s, sexual, attitude, towards, his, mother, and, concomitant, hostility, toward, his, father, first, formed, during, the, phallic, stage, of, psychosexual, development, a, daughter, s, attitude, of, desire, for, her, father, and, hostility, toward, her, mother, is, referred, to, as, the, feminine, oedipus, complex, the, general, concept, was, considered, by, sigmund, freud, in, the, interpretation, of, dreams, 1899, although, the, term, itself, was, introduced, in, his, paper, a, special, type, of, choice, of, object, made, by, men, 1910, freud, s, ideas, of, castration, anxiety, and, penis, envy, refer, to, the, differences, of, the, sexes, in, their, experience, of, the, oedipus, complex, the, complex, is, thought, to, persist, into, adulthood, as, an, unconscious, psychic, structure, which, can, assist, in, social, adaptation, but, also, be, the, cause, of, neurosis, according, to, sexual, difference, a, positive, oedipus, complex, refers, to, the, child, s, sexual, desire, for, the, opposite, sex, parent, and, aversion, to, the, same, sex, parent, while, a, negative, oedipus, complex, refers, to, the, desire, for, the, same, sex, parent, and, aversion, to, the, opposite, sex, parent, freud, considered, that, the, child, s, identification, with, the, same, sex, parent, is, the, socially, acceptable, outcome, of, the, complex, failure, to, move, on, from, the, compulsion, to, satisfy, a, basic, desire, and, to, reconcile, with, the, same, sex, parent, leads, to, neurosis, the, theory, is, named, for, the, mythological, figure, oedipus, an, ancient, theban, king, who, discovers, he, has, unknowingly, murdered, his, father, and, married, his, mother, whose, depiction, in, sophocles, oedipus, rex, had, a, profound, influence, on, freud, freud, rejected, the, term, electra, complex, introduced, by, carl, jung, in, 1913, as, a, proposed, equivalent, complex, among, young, girls, some, critics, have, argued, that, freud, by, abandoning, his, earlier, seduction, theory, which, attributed, neurosis, to, childhood, sexual, abuse, and, replacing, it, with, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, instigated, a, cover, up, for, sexual, abuse, of, children, some, scholars, and, psychologists, have, criticized, the, theory, for, being, incapable, of, applying, to, same, sex, parents, and, as, being, incompatible, with, the, widespread, aversion, to, incest, oedipus, refers, to, a, 5th, century, bc, greek, mythological, character, oedipus, who, unknowingly, kills, his, father, laius, and, marries, his, mother, jocasta, a, play, based, on, the, myth, oedipus, rex, was, written, by, sophocles, c, 429, bc, modern, productions, of, sophocles, play, were, staged, in, paris, and, vienna, in, the, 19th, century, and, were, phenomenally, successful, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, the, austrian, neurologist, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, attended, in, his, book, the, interpretation, of, dreams, first, published, in, 1899, he, proposes, that, an, oedipal, desire, is, a, universal, psychological, phenomenon, innate, phylogenetic, to, human, beings, and, the, cause, of, much, unconscious, guilt, freud, believed, that, the, oedipal, sentiment, has, been, inherited, through, the, millions, of, years, it, took, for, humans, to, evolve, from, apes, his, view, of, its, universality, was, based, on, his, clinical, observation, of, neurotic, or, normal, children, his, analysis, of, his, own, response, to, oedipus, rex, and, on, the, fact, that, the, play, was, effective, on, both, ancient, and, modern, audiences, freud, describes, the, oedipus, myth, s, timeless, appeal, thus, his, destiny, moves, us, only, because, it, might, have, been, ours, because, the, oracle, laid, the, same, curse, upon, us, before, our, birth, as, upon, him, it, is, the, fate, of, all, of, us, perhaps, to, direct, our, first, sexual, impulse, towards, our, mother, and, our, first, hatred, and, our, first, murderous, wish, against, our, father, our, dreams, convince, us, that, this, is, so, freud, also, claims, that, the, play, hamlet, has, its, roots, in, the, same, soil, as, oedipus, rex, and, that, the, differences, between, the, two, plays, are, revealing, in, the, child, s, wishful, fantasy, that, underlies, it, is, brought, into, the, open, and, realized, as, it, would, be, in, a, dream, in, hamlet, it, remains, repressed, and, just, as, in, the, case, of, a, neurosis, we, only, learn, of, its, existence, from, its, inhibiting, consequences, however, in, the, interpretation, of, dreams, freud, makes, it, clear, that, the, primordial, urges, and, fears, that, are, his, concern, and, the, basis, of, the, oedipal, complex, are, inherent, in, the, myths, the, play, is, based, on, not, primarily, in, the, play, itself, which, freud, refers, to, as, a, further, modification, of, the, legend, that, originates, in, a, misconceived, secondary, revision, of, the, material, which, has, sought, to, exploit, it, for, theological, purposes, before, the, idea, of, the, oedipus, complex, freud, believed, that, childhood, sexual, trauma, was, the, cause, of, neurosis, this, idea, sometimes, called, freud, s, seduction, theory, was, deemphasized, in, favor, of, the, oedipus, complex, around, 1897, freud, s, original, examples, of, the, oedipus, complex, are, applied, only, to, boys, or, men, he, never, fully, clarified, his, views, on, the, nature, of, the, complex, in, girls, he, described, the, complex, as, a, young, boy, s, hatred, or, desire, to, eliminate, his, father, and, to, have, sex, with, his, mother, freud, introduced, the, term, oedipus, complex, in, a, 1910, article, titled, a, special, type, of, choice, of, object, made, by, men, it, appears, in, a, section, of, this, paper, describing, what, happens, after, a, boy, first, becomes, aware, of, prostitution, when, after, this, he, can, no, longer, maintain, the, doubt, which, makes, his, parents, an, exception, to, the, universal, and, odious, norms, of, sexual, activity, he, tells, himself, with, cynical, logic, that, the, difference, between, his, mother, and, a, whore, is, not, after, all, so, very, great, since, basically, they, do, the, same, thing, the, enlightening, information, he, has, received, has, in, fact, awakened, the, memory, traces, of, the, impressions, and, wishes, of, his, early, infancy, and, these, have, led, to, a, reactivation, in, him, of, certain, mental, impulses, he, begins, to, desire, his, mother, herself, in, the, sense, with, which, he, has, recently, become, acquainted, and, to, hate, his, father, anew, as, a, rival, who, stands, in, the, way, of, this, wish, he, comes, as, we, say, under, the, dominance, of, the, oedipus, complex, he, does, not, forgive, his, mother, for, having, granted, the, favour, of, sexual, intercourse, not, to, himself, but, to, his, father, and, he, regards, it, as, an, act, of, unfaithfulness, freud, and, others, eventually, extended, this, idea, and, embedded, it, in, a, larger, body, of, theory, in, classical, psychoanalytic, theory, the, oedipus, complex, occurs, during, the, phallic, stage, of, psychosexual, development, age, 3, 6, years, although, it, can, manifest, at, an, earlier, age, in, the, phallic, stage, a, boy, s, decisive, psychosexual, experience, is, the, oedipus, complex, his, son, father, competition, for, possession, of, his, mother, it, is, in, this, third, stage, of, psychosexual, development, that, the, child, s, genitalia, is, his, or, her, primary, erogenous, zone, thus, when, children, become, aware, of, their, bodies, the, bodies, of, other, children, and, the, bodies, of, their, parents, they, gratify, physical, curiosity, by, undressing, and, exploring, themselves, each, other, and, their, genitals, so, learning, the, anatomic, differences, between, male, and, female, and, the, gender, differences, between, boy, and, girl, despite, the, mother, being, the, parent, who, primarily, gratifies, the, child, s, desires, the, child, begins, forming, a, discrete, sexual, identity, boy, girl, that, alters, the, dynamics, of, the, parent, and, child, relationship, the, parents, become, objects, of, infantile, libidinal, energy, the, boy, directs, his, libido, sexual, desire, toward, his, mother, and, directs, jealousy, and, emotional, rivalry, against, his, father, the, boy, s, desire, for, his, mother, is, concomitant, with, a, desire, for, the, death, of, his, father, and, even, an, impulse, to, instigate, that, death, these, desires, manifest, in, the, realm, of, the, id, governed, by, the, pleasure, principle, but, the, pragmatic, ego, governed, by, the, reality, principle, knows, that, the, father, is, an, impossible, rival, to, overcome, and, the, impulse, is, repressed, the, boy, s, ambivalence, about, his, father, s, place, in, the, family, is, manifested, as, fear, of, castration, by, the, physically, superior, father, the, fear, is, an, irrational, subconscious, manifestation, of, the, infantile, id, in, both, sexes, defense, mechanisms, provide, transitory, resolutions, of, the, conflict, between, the, drives, of, the, id, and, the, drives, of, the, ego, repression, the, blocking, of, unacceptable, ideas, and, impulses, from, the, conscious, mind, is, the, first, defence, mechanism, but, its, action, does, not, resolve, the, id, ego, conflict, it, merely, confines, the, impulse, in, the, unconscious, where, it, continues, to, exert, pressure, in, the, direction, of, consciousness, the, second, defense, mechanism, is, identification, in, which, the, child, adapts, by, incorporating, into, his, or, her, super, ego, the, personality, characteristics, of, the, same, sex, parent, in, the, case, of, the, boy, this, diminishes, his, castration, anxiety, because, his, likeness, to, his, father, protects, him, from, the, consequences, of, their, rivalry, the, little, girl, s, anxiety, is, diminished, in, her, identification, with, the, mother, who, understands, that, neither, of, them, possesses, a, penis, and, thus, are, not, antagonists, the, satisfactory, resolution, of, the, oedipus, complex, is, considered, important, in, developing, the, male, infantile, super, ego, by, identifying, with, the, father, the, boy, internalizes, social, morality, thereby, potentially, becoming, a, voluntary, self, regulating, follower, of, societal, rules, rather, than, merely, reflexively, complying, out, of, fear, of, punishment, unresolved, son, father, competition, for, the, psychosexual, possession, of, the, mother, might, result, in, a, phallic, stage, fixation, that, leads, to, the, boy, becoming, an, aggressive, over, ambitious, and, vain, man, in, analysis, of, a, phobia, in, a, five, year, old, boy, 1909, the, case, study, of, the, equinophobic, boy, little, hans, freud, claimed, that, the, relation, between, hans, s, fears, of, horses, and, of, his, father, derived, from, external, factors, the, birth, of, a, sister, and, internal, factors, the, desire, of, the, infantile, id, to, replace, his, father, as, companion, to, his, mother, and, guilt, for, enjoying, the, masturbation, normal, to, a, boy, of, his, age, little, hans, himself, was, unable, to, relate, his, fear, of, horses, to, his, fear, of, his, father, as, the, treating, psychoanalyst, freud, noted, that, hans, had, to, be, told, many, things, that, he, could, not, say, himself, and, that, he, had, to, be, presented, with, thoughts, which, he, had, so, far, shown, no, signs, of, possessing, freud, applied, the, oedipus, complex, to, the, psychosexual, development, of, boys, and, girls, but, later, modified, the, female, aspects, of, the, theory, as, feminine, oedipus, attitude, and, negative, oedipus, complex, his, student, collaborator, carl, jung, in, his, 1913, work, the, theory, of, psychoanalysis, proposed, the, electra, complex, to, describe, a, girl, s, daughter, mother, competition, for, psychosexual, possession, of, the, father, in, the, phallic, stage, the, feminine, oedipus, attitude, is, the, little, girl, s, decisive, psychodynamic, experience, in, forming, a, discrete, sexual, identity, ego, whereas, a, boy, develops, castration, anxiety, a, girl, develops, penis, envy, for, she, perceives, that, she, has, been, castrated, previously, and, missing, the, penis, and, so, forms, resentment, towards, her, own, kind, as, inferior, while, simultaneously, striving, to, claim, her, father, s, penis, through, bearing, a, male, child, of, her, own, furthermore, after, the, phallic, stage, the, girl, s, psychosexual, development, includes, transferring, her, primary, erogenous, zone, from, the, infantile, clitoris, to, the, adult, vagina, freud, considered, a, girl, s, negative, oedipus, complex, to, be, more, emotionally, intense, than, that, of, a, boy, resulting, potentially, in, a, woman, of, submissive, insecure, personality, in, response, to, freud, s, proposal, of, the, oedipus, complex, which, was, initially, more, focused, on, the, little, boy, s, experience, of, desire, for, the, mother, and, jealous, rivalry, in, relation, of, the, father, student, collaborator, carl, jung, proposed, that, girls, experienced, desire, for, the, father, and, aggression, towards, the, mother, via, what, he, called, the, electra, complex, electra, was, a, greek, mythologic, figure, who, plotted, matricidal, revenge, with, orestes, her, brother, against, their, mother, clytemnestra, and, their, stepfather, aegisthus, for, the, murder, of, her, father, agamemnon, like, oedipus, the, character, is, the, subject, of, a, play, by, sophocles, electra, from, the, 5th, century, bc, orthodox, jungian, psychology, uses, the, term, oedipus, complex, only, to, denote, a, boy, s, psychosexual, development, freud, himself, rejected, the, equivalence, arguing, that, at, this, stage, of, development, it, is, only, the, male, who, experiences, a, simultaneous, love, for, one, parent, and, competitive, hatred, for, the, other, for, freud, the, idea, of, the, electra, complex, assumes, an, analogous, relation, between, boys, and, girls, in, relation, to, their, same, and, opposite, sex, parents, that, does, not, actually, exist, according, to, freud, the, electra, complex, fails, to, take, account, of, the, differing, effects, of, the, castration, complex, and, the, significance, of, the, phallus, in, the, two, sexes, and, overlooks, the, girl, s, preoedipal, attachment, to, the, mother, in, classical, freudian, psychology, the, super, ego, the, heir, to, the, oedipus, complex, is, formed, as, the, infant, boy, internalizes, the, familial, rules, of, his, father, in, contrast, in, the, early, 1920s, using, the, term, pre, oedipal, otto, rank, proposed, that, a, boy, s, powerful, mother, was, the, source, of, the, super, ego, in, the, course, of, normal, psychosexual, development, rank, s, theoretic, conflict, with, freud, excluded, him, from, the, freudian, inner, circle, nonetheless, he, later, developed, the, psychodynamic, object, relations, theory, in, 1925, whereas, freud, proposed, that, the, father, the, paternal, phallus, was, central, to, infantile, and, adult, psychosexual, development, melanie, klein, concentrated, on, the, early, maternal, relationship, proposing, that, oedipal, manifestations, are, perceptible, in, the, first, year, of, life, the, oral, stage, her, proposal, was, part, of, the, controversial, discussions, 1942, 44, at, the, british, psychoanalytical, association, the, kleinian, psychologists, proposed, that, underlying, the, oedipus, complex, as, freud, described, it, there, is, an, earlier, layer, of, more, primitive, relationships, with, the, oedipal, couple, she, assigned, dangerous, destructive, tendencies, not, just, to, the, father, but, also, to, the, mother, in, her, discussion, of, the, child, s, projective, fantasies, klein, s, concept, of, the, depressive, position, resulting, from, the, infant, s, ambivalence, toward, the, mother, lessened, the, central, importance, of, the, oedipus, complex, in, psychosexual, development, for, the, post, kleinian, bion, the, myth, of, oedipus, concerns, investigatory, curiosity, the, quest, for, knowledge, rather, than, sexual, difference, the, other, main, character, in, the, oedipal, drama, becomes, tiresias, the, false, hypothesis, erected, against, anxiety, about, a, new, theory, as, a, result, bion, regarded, the, central, crime, of, oedipus, as, his, insistence, on, knowing, the, truth, at, all, costs, jacques, lacan, argued, against, removing, the, oedipus, complex, from, the, center, of, psychosexual, developmental, experience, for, him, the, oedipus, complex, in, so, far, as, we, continue, to, recognize, it, as, covering, the, whole, field, of, our, experience, with, its, signification, may, be, said, to, mark, the, limits, that, our, discipline, assigns, to, subjectivity, it, is, that, which, superimposes, the, kingdom, of, culture, upon, the, person, marking, his, or, her, introduction, to, the, symbolic, order, thus, a, child, learns, what, power, independent, of, itself, is, as, it, goes, through, the, oedipus, complex, encountering, the, existence, of, a, symbolic, system, independent, of, itself, moreover, lacan, s, proposal, that, the, ternary, relation, of, the, oedipus, complex, liberates, the, prisoner, of, the, dual, relationship, of, the, son, mother, relationship, proved, useful, to, later, psychoanalysts, thus, for, bollas, the, achievement, of, the, oedipus, complex, is, that, the, child, comes, to, understand, something, about, the, oddity, of, possessing, one, s, own, mind, discovers, the, multiplicity, of, points, of, view, likewise, for, ronald, britton, if, the, link, between, the, parents, perceived, in, love, and, hate, can, be, tolerated, in, the, child, s, mind, this, provides, us, with, a, capacity, for, seeing, us, in, interaction, with, others, and, for, reflecting, on, ourselves, whilst, being, ourselves, as, such, in, the, dove, that, returns, the, dove, that, vanishes, 2000, michael, parsons, proposed, that, such, a, perspective, permits, viewing, the, oedipus, complex, as, a, life, long, developmental, challenge, new, kinds, of, oedipal, configurations, that, belong, to, later, life, in, 1920, sigmund, freud, wrote, that, with, the, progress, of, psychoanalytic, studies, the, importance, of, the, oedipus, complex, has, become, more, and, more, clearly, evident, its, recognition, has, become, the, shibboleth, that, distinguishes, the, adherents, of, psychoanalysis, from, its, opponents, thereby, it, remained, a, theoretic, cornerstone, of, psychoanalysis, until, about, 1930, when, psychoanalysts, began, investigating, the, pre, oedipal, son, mother, relationship, within, the, theory, of, psychosexual, development, janet, malcolm, reports, that, by, the, late, 20th, century, to, the, object, relations, psychology, avant, garde, the, events, of, the, oedipal, period, are, pallid, and, inconsequential, in, comparison, with, the, cliff, hanging, psychodramas, of, infancy, for, kohut, as, for, winnicott, and, balint, the, oedipus, complex, is, an, irrelevance, in, the, treatment, of, severe, pathology, nonetheless, ego, psychology, continued, to, maintain, that, the, oedipal, period, roughly, three, and, a, half, to, six, years, is, like, lorenz, standing, in, front, of, the, chick, it, is, the, most, formative, significant, moulding, experience, of, human, life, if, you, take, a, person, s, adult, life, his, love, his, work, his, hobbies, his, ambitions, they, all, point, back, to, the, oedipus, complex, studies, conducted, of, children, s, attitudes, to, parents, at, the, oedipal, stage, do, not, demonstrate, the, shifts, in, positive, feelings, that, are, predicted, by, the, theory, case, studies, that, freud, relied, upon, such, as, the, case, of, little, hans, could, not, be, verified, through, research, or, experimentation, on, a, larger, population, adolf, gr, nbaum, argues, that, the, type, of, evidence, freud, and, his, followers, used, the, clinical, productions, of, patients, during, analytic, treatment, by, their, nature, cannot, provide, cogent, observational, support, for, freud, s, core, hypotheses, evolutionary, psychologists, martin, daly, and, margo, wilson, in, their, 1988, book, homicide, argue, that, the, oedipus, complex, theory, yields, few, testable, predictions, they, find, no, evidence, of, the, oedipus, complex, in, people, there, is, evidence, of, parent, child, conflict, but, it, is, not, for, sexual, possession, of, the, opposite, sex, parent, according, to, psychiatrist, jeffrey, lieberman, freud, and, his, followers, resisted, subjecting, his, theories, including, the, oedipus, theory, to, scientific, testing, and, verification, lieberman, claims, that, investigations, based, in, cognitive, psychology, either, contradict, or, fail, to, support, freud, s, ideas, in, the, 1970s, social, worker, florence, rush, wrote, that, freud, s, seduction, theory, which, came, early, in, his, career, correctly, attributed, his, patients, memories, of, childhood, trauma, to, the, patient, s, family, often, the, father, implying, that, widespread, sexual, abuse, of, children, by, parents, was, common, in, his, society, according, to, rush, the, discovery, of, this, abuse, made, freud, uncomfortable, so, he, abandoned, the, theory, and, invented, the, oedipus, complex, to, replace, it, the, oedipus, complex, allowed, him, to, attribute, stories, of, childhood, sexual, abuse, to, the, children, themselves, freud, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, stories, were, fantasies, of, hidden, desires, rather, than, factual, descriptions, of, trauma, thus, rush, argues, freud, covered, up, illegal, and, immoral, sexual, abuse, by, undermining, the, perceptions, of, his, patients, particularly, his, female, patients, rush, s, theory, became, known, as, the, freudian, coverup, a, director, of, the, sigmund, freud, archives, jeffrey, moussaieff, masson, adopted, the, view, that, freud, s, work, was, a, cover, up, for, abuse, after, reading, freud, s, unpublished, letters, in, his, book, the, assault, on, truth, masson, argues, that, freud, misattributed, accounts, of, sexual, abuse, to, fabrications, and, fantasies, of, children, because, for, personal, reasons, he, was, unable, to, accept, that, the, accounts, were, real, according, to, masson, among, freud, s, reasons, to, suppress, the, abuse, was, that, he, did, not, want, to, be, confronted, by, the, father, of, a, patient, who, was, accused, of, committing, abuse, late, in, his, career, freud, sought, to, prevent, colleague, sandor, ferenczi, from, delivering, a, paper, that, reasserted, the, seduction, theory, freud, had, hoped, that, his, former, student, would, abandon, the, theory, as, he, himself, had, done, but, ferenczi, delivered, the, paper, in, 1932, masson, writes, that, because, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, became, widely, popular, psychoanalysts, continue, to, do, damage, to, their, patients, by, doubting, the, reality, of, the, patient, s, early, memories, of, trauma, other, freud, scholars, argue, that, masson, and, rush, have, misrepresented, the, reasons, and, intention, behind, freud, s, abandonment, of, the, seduction, theory, and, adoption, of, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, according, to, dr, kurt, r, eissler, who, replaced, masson, as, director, of, the, freud, archives, freud, did, not, in, any, sense, reject, the, reality, of, childhood, sexual, trauma, but, realized, that, actual, abuse, was, not, the, universal, cause, of, neurosis, he, had, thought, it, to, be, new, york, psychiatrist, dr, frank, r, hartmann, said, that, freud, realized, he, made, a, mistake, in, attributing, all, neurosis, to, repressed, memories, of, actual, abuse, he, discovered, a, much, broader, theory, which, explained, much, more, the, historian, peter, gay, author, of, freud, a, life, for, our, time, 1988, emphasizes, that, freud, continued, to, believe, that, some, patients, were, sexually, abused, but, realized, that, there, can, be, a, difficulty, in, distinguishing, between, truth, and, fiction, therefore, according, to, gay, there, was, no, sinister, motive, in, changing, his, theory, freud, was, a, scientist, seeking, the, facts, and, was, entitled, to, change, his, views, if, new, evidence, was, presented, to, him, many, scholars, and, psychologists, observe, that, because, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, assigns, distinct, roles, to, a, mother, and, father, it, is, a, poor, fit, for, families, that, do, not, use, traditional, gender, roles, as, of, november, 2022, same, sex, marriage, is, legal, in, 31, nations, same, sex, couples, start, families, through, adoption, or, surrogacy, the, pillars, of, the, family, structure, are, diversifying, to, include, parents, who, are, single, or, of, the, same, sex, as, their, partner, along, with, the, traditional, heterosexual, married, parents, these, new, family, structures, pose, new, questions, for, the, psychoanalytic, theories, such, as, the, oedipus, complex, that, require, the, presence, of, the, mother, and, the, father, in, the, successful, development, of, a, child, evidence, suggests, children, who, have, been, raised, by, parents, of, the, same, sex, are, not, much, different, from, children, raised, in, a, traditional, family, structure, the, classic, theory, of, the, oedipal, drama, has, fallen, out, of, favor, in, today, s, society, according, to, a, study, by, drescher, having, been, criticized, for, its, negative, implications, towards, same, sex, parents, many, psychoanalytic, thinkers, such, as, chodorow, and, corbett, are, working, towards, changing, the, oedipus, complex, to, eliminate, automatic, associations, among, sex, gender, and, the,

oedipus, according, to, didier, eribon, eribon, criticizes, the, oedipus, complex, described, by, freud, or, lacan, as, an, implausible, ideological, construct, which, is, an, inferiorization,

loose, interpretation, of, the, oedipus, complex, in, which, the, child, seeks, sexual, satisfaction, from, any, parent, regardless, of, gender, or, sex, would, be, helpful, from, this, perspective, any, parental, authority, or, institution, for, that, matter, may, represent, the, taboo, that, gives, rise, to, the, complex, psychoanalyst, melanie, klein, proposed, a, theory, which, broke, gender,

this, post, lacanian, interpretation, of, the, complex, diverges, considerably, from, its, description, in, 19th, century, eribon, writes, that, it, stretches, the, oedipus, complex, to, a, point, where, it, almost, doesn, t, look, like, freud, s, any, more, parent, child, and, sibling, sibling, incestuous, unions, are, almost, universally, forbidden, an, explanation, for, this, incest, taboo,

domination, that, are, reinforced, in, the, use, of, this, myth, in, other, words, if, oedipus, was, bantu, or, baoul, his, story, would, probably, not, be, viewed, as, a, human, universal, this,

penis, for, girls, in, the, oedipus, complex, she, thinks, that, freud, s, desire, for, a, neat, symmetrical, theory, leads, him, to, a, contrived, understanding, of, women, as, inverse, men, she,
