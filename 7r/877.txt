in, the, social, sciences, there, is, a, standing, debate, over, the, primacy, of, structure, or, agency, in, shaping, human, behaviour, structure, is, the, recurrent, patterned, arrangements, which, influence, or, limit, the, choices, and, opportunities, available, agency, is, the, capacity, of, individuals, to, act, independently, and, to, make, their, own, free, choices, the, structure, versus, agency, debate, may, be, understood, as, an, issue, of, socialization, against, autonomy, in, determining, whether, an, individual, acts, as, a, free, agent, or, in, a, manner, dictated, by, social, structure, the, debate, over, the, primacy, of, structure, or, of, agency, relates, to, an, issue, at, the, heart, of, both, classical, and, contemporary, sociological, theory, the, question, of, social, ontology, what, is, the, social, world, made, of, what, is, a, cause, of, the, social, world, and, what, is, an, effect, do, social, structures, determine, an, individual, s, behaviour, or, does, human, agency, structural, functionalists, such, as, mile, durkheim, see, structure, and, hierarchy, as, essential, in, establishing, the, very, existence, of, society, theorists, such, as, karl, marx, by, contrast, emphasize, that, the, social, structure, can, act, to, the, detriment, of, the, majority, of, individuals, in, a, society, in, both, these, instances, structure, may, refer, to, something, both, material, or, economic, and, cultural, i, e, related, to, norms, customs, traditions, and, ideologies, some, theorists, put, forward, that, what, we, know, as, our, social, existence, is, largely, determined, by, the, overall, structure, of, society, the, perceived, agency, of, individuals, can, also, mostly, be, explained, by, the, operation, of, this, structure, theoretical, systems, aligned, with, this, view, include, all, of, these, schools, in, this, context, can, be, seen, as, forms, of, holism, the, notion, that, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, on, the, other, hand, other, theorists, stress, the, capacity, of, individual, agents, to, construct, and, reconstruct, their, worlds, in, this, sense, the, individual, can, be, viewed, as, more, influential, than, the, system, theoretical, systems, aligned, with, this, view, include, lastly, a, third, option, taken, by, many, modern, social, theorists, attempts, to, find, a, point, of, balance, between, the, two, previous, positions, they, see, structure, and, agency, as, complementary, forces, structure, influences, human, behaviour, and, humans, are, capable, of, changing, the, social, structures, they, inhabit, structuration, issue, one, prominent, example, of, this, view, the, first, approach, emphasizing, the, importance, of, societal, structure, dominated, in, classical, sociology, theorists, saw, unique, aspects, of, the, social, world, that, could, not, be, explained, simply, by, the, sum, of, the, individuals, present, durkheim, strongly, believed, that, the, collective, had, emergent, properties, of, its, own, and, saw, the, need, for, a, science, which, would, deal, with, this, emergence, the, second, approach, methodological, individualism, etc, however, also, has, a, well, established, position, in, social, science, many, theorists, still, follow, this, course, economists, for, example, tend, to, disregard, any, kind, of, holism, the, central, debate, therefore, pits, theorists, committed, to, the, notions, of, methodological, holism, against, those, committed, to, methodological, individualism, the, first, notion, methodological, holism, is, the, idea, that, actors, are, socialized, and, embedded, into, social, structures, and, institutions, that, constrain, or, enable, and, generally, shape, the, individuals, dispositions, towards, and, capacities, for, action, and, that, this, social, structure, should, be, taken, as, primary, and, most, significant, the, second, notion, methodological, individualism, is, the, idea, that, actors, are, the, central, theoretical, and, ontological, elements, in, social, systems, and, social, structure, is, an, epiphenomenon, a, result, and, consequence, of, the, actions, and, activities, of, interacting, individuals, georg, simmel, 1858, 1918, was, one, of, the, first, generation, of, german, nonpositivist, sociologists, his, studies, pioneered, the, concepts, of, social, structure, and, agency, his, most, famous, works, today, include, the, metropolis, and, mental, life, and, the, philosophy, of, money, norbert, elias, 1897, 1990, was, a, german, sociologist, whose, work, focused, on, the, relationship, between, power, behaviour, emotion, and, knowledge, over, time, he, significantly, shaped, what, is, called, process, sociology, or, figurational, sociology, talcott, parsons, 1902, 1979, was, an, american, sociologist, and, the, main, theorist, of, action, theory, misleadingly, called, structural, functionalism, in, sociology, from, the, 1930s, in, the, united, states, his, works, analyze, social, structure, but, in, terms, of, voluntary, action, and, through, patterns, of, normative, institutionalization, by, codifying, its, theoretical, gestalt, into, a, system, theoretical, framework, based, on, the, idea, of, living, systems, and, cybernetic, hierarchy, for, parsons, there, is, no, structure, agency, problem, it, is, a, pseudo, problem, his, development, of, max, weber, s, means, end, action, structure, is, summarized, in, instrumental, and, value, rational, action, pierre, bourdieu, 1930, 2002, was, a, french, theorist, who, presented, his, theory, of, practice, on, the, dichotomic, understanding, of, the, relation, between, agency, and, structure, in, a, great, number, of, publications, beginning, with, an, outline, of, the, theory, of, practice, in, 1972, where, he, presented, the, concept, of, habitus, his, book, distinction, a, social, critique, of, the, judgement, of, taste, 1979, was, named, as, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, 10, most, important, works, of, sociology, by, the, international, sociological, association, the, key, concepts, in, bourdieu, s, work, are, habitus, field, and, capital, the, agent, is, socialized, in, a, field, an, evolving, set, of, roles, and, relationships, in, a, social, domain, where, various, forms, of, capital, such, as, prestige, or, financial, resources, are, at, stake, as, the, agent, accommodates, to, their, roles, and, relationships, in, the, context, of, their, position, in, the, field, they, internalize, relationships, and, expectations, for, operating, in, that, domain, these, internalized, relationships, and, habitual, expectations, and, relationships, form, over, time, the, habitus, bourdieu, s, work, attempts, to, reconcile, structure, and, agency, as, external, structures, are, internalized, into, the, habitus, while, the, actions, of, the, agent, externalize, interactions, between, actors, into, the, social, relationships, in, the, field, bourdieu, s, theory, therefore, is, a, dialectic, between, externalizing, the, internal, and, internalizing, the, external, peter, l, berger, and, thomas, luckmann, in, their, social, construction, of, reality, 1966, saw, the, relationship, between, structure, and, agency, as, dialectical, society, forms, the, individuals, who, create, society, forming, a, continuous, loop, the, sociologist, james, samuel, coleman, famously, diagramed, the, link, between, macrosociological, phenomena, and, individual, behaviour, in, what, is, commonly, referred, to, as, coleman, s, boat, a, macro, level, phenomenon, is, described, as, instigating, particular, actions, by, individuals, which, results, in, a, subsequent, macro, level, phenomenon, in, this, way, individual, action, is, taken, in, reference, to, a, macro, sociological, structure, and, that, action, by, many, individuals, results, in, change, to, that, macro, structure, contemporary, sociology, has, generally, aimed, toward, a, reconciliation, of, structure, and, agency, as, concepts, anthony, giddens, has, developed, structuration, theory, in, such, works, as, the, constitution, of, society, 1984, he, presents, a, developed, attempt, to, move, beyond, the, dualism, of, structure, and, agency, and, argues, for, the, duality, of, structure, where, social, structure, is, both, the, medium, and, the, outcome, of, social, action, and, agents, and, structures, as, mutually, constitutive, entities, with, equal, ontological, status, for, giddens, an, agent, s, common, interaction, with, structure, as, a, system, of, norms, is, described, as, structuration, the, term, reflexivity, is, used, to, refer, to, the, ability, of, an, agent, to, consciously, alter, his, or, her, place, in, the, social, structure, thus, globalization, and, the, emergence, of, the, post, traditional, society, might, be, said, to, allow, for, greater, social, reflexivity, social, and, political, sciences, are, therefore, important, because, social, knowledge, as, self, knowledge, is, potentially, emancipatory, his, access, to, research, on, structure, and, agency, is, characterized, by, socialization, theory, central, to, the, theory, is, the, life, long, interaction, between, the, individual, and, his, her, longing, for, freedom, and, autonomy, and, society, with, its, pressure, of, order, and, structure, as, he, states, in, his, model, of, productive, processing, of, reality, ppr, personality, does, not, form, independently, from, society, any, of, its, functions, or, dimensions, but, is, continuously, being, shaped, in, a, concrete, historically, conveyed, life, world, throughout, the, entire, space, of, the, life, span, the, ppr, model, places, the, human, subject, in, a, social, and, ecological, context, that, must, be, absorbed, and, processed, subjectively, the, human, being, as, an, autonomous, subject, has, the, lifelong, task, to, harmonize, the, processes, of, social, integration, and, personal, individualization, this, task, is, mastered, in, specific, steps, that, are, typical, for, the, respective, age, and, the, achieved, developmental, stage, developmental, tasks, the, social, theorist, and, legal, philosopher, roberto, mangabeira, unger, developed, the, thesis, of, negative, capability, to, address, this, problem, of, agency, in, relation, to, structure, in, his, work, on, false, necessity, or, anti, necessitarian, social, theory, unger, recognizes, the, constraints, of, structure, and, its, molding, influence, upon, the, individual, but, at, the, same, time, finds, the, individual, able, to, resist, deny, and, transcend, their, context, the, varieties, of, this, resistance, are, negative, capability, unlike, other, theories, of, structure, and, agency, negative, capability, does, not, reduce, the, individual, to, a, simple, actor, possessing, only, the, dual, capacity, of, compliance, or, rebellion, but, rather, sees, him, or, her, as, able, to, partake, in, a, variety, of, activities, of, self, empowerment, a, recent, development, in, the, debate, is, the, critical, realist, structure, agency, perspective, embodied, in, roy, bhaskar, s, transformational, model, of, social, action, tmsa, which, he, later, expanded, into, his, concept, of, four, planar, social, being, a, major, difference, between, giddens, structuration, theory, and, the, tmsa, is, that, the, tmsa, includes, a, temporal, element, time, the, tmsa, has, been, further, advocated, and, applied, in, other, social, science, fields, by, additional, authors, for, example, in, economics, by, tony, lawson, and, in, sociology, by, margaret, archer, in, 2005, the, journal, of, management, studies, debated, the, merits, of, critical, realism, kenneth, wilkinson, in, the, community, in, rural, america, took, an, interactional, field, theoretical, perspective, focusing, on, the, role, of, community, agency, in, contributing, to, the, emergence, of, community, with, critical, psychology, as, a, framework, the, danish, psychologist, ole, dreier, proposes, in, his, book, psychotherapy, in, everyday, life, that, we, may, best, conceptualize, persons, as, participants, in, social, practices, that, constitute, social, structures, who, can, either, reproduce, or, change, these, social, practices, this, indicates, that, neither, participants, nor, social, practices, can, be, understood, when, looked, at, in, isolation, in, fact, this, undermines, the, very, idea, of, trying, to, do, so, since, practice, and, structure, is, co, created, by, participants, and, since, the, participants, can, only, be, called, so, if, they, participate, in, a, social, practice, the, structure, agency, debate, continues, to, evolve, with, contributions, such, as, nicos, mouzelis, s, sociological, theory, what, went, wrong, and, margaret, archer, s, realist, social, theory, the, morphogenetic, approach, continuing, to, push, the, ongoing, development, of, structure, agency, theory, work, in, information, systems, by, mutch, 2010, has, emphasized, archer, s, realist, social, theory, as, well, as, robert, archer, s, 2018, application, in, the, field, of, education, policy, and, organization, theory, in, entrepreneurship, a, discussion, between, sarason, et, al, and, mole, mole, 2010, used, archer, s, theory, to, critique, structuration, by, arguing, that, starting, a, new, business, organization, needs, to, be, understood, in, the, context, of, social, structure, and, agency, however, this, depends, upon, one, s, view, of, structure, which, differs, between, giddens, and, archer, hence, if, strata, in, social, reality, have, different, ontologies, then, they, must, be, viewed, as, a, dualism, moreover, agents, have, causal, power, and, ultimate, concerns, which, they, try, to, fallibly, put, into, practice, mole, and, mole, propose, entrepreneurship, as, the, study, of, the, interplay, between, the, structures, of, a, society, and, the, agents, within, it, while, the, structure, agency, debate, has, been, a, central, issue, in, social, theory, and, recent, theoretical, reconciliation, attempts, have, been, made, structure, agency, theory, has, tended, to, develop, more, in, european, countries, by, european, theorists, while, social, theorists, from, the, united, states, have, tended, to, focus, instead, on, the, issue, of, integration, between, macrosociological, and, microsociological, perspectives, george, ritzer, examines, these, issues, and, surveys, the, structure, agency, debate, in, greater, detail, in, his, book, modern, sociological, theory, 2000
