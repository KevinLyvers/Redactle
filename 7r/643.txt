a, cult, of, personality, or, a, cult, of, the, leader, is, the, result, of, an, effort, which, is, made, to, create, an, idealized, and, heroic, image, of, a, glorious, leader, often, through, unquestioning, flattery, and, praise, historically, it, has, developed, through, techniques, of, mass, media, propaganda, spectacle, the, arts, patriotism, and, government, organized, demonstrations, and, rallies, a, cult, of, personality, is, similar, to, apotheosis, except, that, it, is, established, by, modern, social, engineering, techniques, usually, by, the, state, or, the, party, in, one, party, states, and, dominant, party, states, cults, of, personality, often, accompany, the, leaders, of, totalitarian, or, authoritarian, governments, they, can, also, be, seen, in, some, monarchies, theocracies, failed, democracies, and, even, in, liberal, democracies, throughout, human, history, monarchs, and, other, heads, of, state, were, frequently, treated, with, enormous, reverence, and, they, were, also, thought, to, be, endowed, with, super, human, qualities, through, the, principle, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, notably, in, medieval, europe, rulers, were, said, to, hold, office, by, the, will, of, god, or, the, will, of, the, gods, ancient, egypt, imperial, japan, the, inca, the, aztecs, tibet, siam, now, thailand, and, the, roman, empire, are, especially, noted, for, their, redefinition, of, monarchs, as, god, kings, furthermore, the, imperial, cult, of, ancient, rome, identified, emperors, and, some, members, of, their, families, with, the, divinely, sanctioned, authority, auctoritas, of, the, roman, state, the, spread, of, democratic, and, secular, ideas, in, europe, and, north, america, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, made, it, increasingly, difficult, for, monarchs, to, preserve, this, aura, though, napoleon, iii, and, queen, victoria, appreciated, its, perpetuation, in, their, carte, de, visite, portraits, which, proliferated, circulated, and, were, collected, in, the, 19th, century, the, subsequent, development, of, mass, media, such, as, radio, enabled, political, leaders, to, project, a, positive, image, of, themselves, onto, the, masses, as, never, before, it, was, from, these, circumstances, in, the, 20th, century, that, the, most, notorious, personality, cults, arose, frequently, these, cults, are, a, form, of, political, religion, the, advent, of, the, internet, and, the, world, wide, web, in, the, 21st, century, has, renewed, the, personality, cult, phenomenon, disinformation, via, social, media, platforms, and, the, twenty, four, hour, news, cycle, has, enabled, the, widespread, dissemination, and, acceptance, of, deceptive, information, and, propaganda, as, a, result, personality, cults, have, grown, and, remained, popular, in, many, places, corresponding, with, a, marked, rise, in, authoritarian, government, across, the, world, the, term, cult, of, personality, likely, appeared, in, english, around, 1800, 1850, along, with, the, french, and, german, versions, of, the, term, it, initially, had, no, political, connotations, but, was, instead, closely, related, to, the, romanticist, cult, of, genius, the, first, known, political, use, of, the, phrase, appeared, in, a, letter, from, karl, marx, to, german, political, worker, wilhelm, blos, dated, to, november, 10, 1877, neither, of, us, cares, a, straw, of, popularity, let, me, cite, one, proof, of, this, such, was, my, aversion, to, the, personality, cult, that, at, the, time, of, the, international, when, plagued, by, numerous, moves, to, accord, me, public, honor, i, never, allowed, one, of, these, to, enter, the, domain, of, publicity, there, are, various, views, about, what, constitutes, a, cult, of, personality, in, a, leader, historian, jan, plamper, wrote, that, modern, day, personality, cults, display, five, characteristics, that, set, them, apart, from, their, predecessors, the, cults, are, secular, and, anchored, in, popular, sovereignty, their, objects, are, all, males, they, target, the, entire, population, not, only, the, well, to, do, or, just, the, ruling, class, they, use, mass, media, they, exist, where, the, mass, media, can, be, controlled, enough, to, inhibit, the, introduction, of, rival, cults, in, his, 2013, paper, what, is, character, and, why, it, really, does, matter, thomas, a, wright, stated, the, cult, of, personality, phenomenon, refers, to, the, idealized, even, god, like, public, image, of, an, individual, consciously, shaped, and, molded, through, constant, propaganda, and, media, exposure, as, a, result, one, is, able, to, manipulate, others, based, entirely, on, the, influence, of, public, personality, the, cult, of, personality, perspective, focuses, on, the, often, shallow, external, images, that, many, public, figures, cultivate, to, create, an, idealized, and, heroic, image, adrian, teodor, popan, defined, a, cult, of, personality, as, a, quantitatively, exaggerated, and, qualitatively, extravagant, public, demonstration, of, praise, of, the, leader, he, also, identified, three, causal, necessary, but, not, sufficient, structural, conditions, and, a, path, dependent, chain, of, events, which, together, lead, to, the, cult, formation, a, particular, combination, of, patrimonialism, and, clientelism, lack, of, dissidence, and, systematic, falsification, pervading, the, society, s, culture, one, underlying, characteristic, as, explained, by, john, pittman, is, the, nature, of, the, cult, of, personalities, to, be, a, patriarch, the, idea, of, the, cult, of, personalities, that, coincides, with, the, marxist, movements, gains, popular, footing, among, the, men, in, power, with, the, idea, that, they, would, be, the, fathers, of, the, people, by, the, end, of, the, 1920s, the, male, features, of, the, cults, became, more, extreme, pittman, identifies, that, these, features, became, roles, including, the, formal, role, for, a, great, leader, as, a, cultural, focus, of, the, apparatus, of, the, regime, reliance, on, top, down, administrative, measures, and, a, pyramidal, structure, of, authority, which, was, created, by, a, single, ideal, the, twentieth, century, brought, technological, advancements, that, made, it, possible, for, regimes, to, package, propaganda, in, the, form, of, radio, broadcasts, films, and, later, content, on, the, internet, writing, in, 2013, thomas, a, wright, observed, that, t, is, becoming, evident, that, the, charismatic, leader, especially, in, politics, has, increasingly, become, the, product, of, media, and, self, exposure, focusing, on, the, media, in, the, united, states, robert, n, bellah, added, it, is, hard, to, determine, the, extent, to, which, the, media, reflect, the, cult, of, personality, in, american, politics, and, to, what, extent, they, have, created, it, surely, they, did, not, create, it, all, alone, but, just, as, surely, they, have, contributed, to, it, in, any, case, american, politics, is, dominated, by, the, personalities, of, political, leaders, to, an, extent, rare, in, the, modern, world, in, the, personalized, politics, of, recent, years, the, charisma, of, the, leader, may, be, almost, entirely, a, product, of, media, exposure, often, a, single, leader, became, associated, with, this, revolutionary, transformation, and, came, to, be, treated, as, a, benevolent, guide, for, the, nation, without, whom, the, claimed, transformation, to, a, better, future, could, not, occur, generally, this, has, been, the, justification, for, personality, cults, that, arose, in, totalitarian, societies, such, as, those, of, adolf, hitler, of, nazi, germany, joseph, stalin, of, the, ussr, kim, il, sung, his, son, kim, jong, il, and, currently, ruling, grandson, kim, jong, un, of, north, korea, mao, zedong, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, hafez, al, assad, of, syria, whose, son, bashar, al, assad, currently, rules, the, country, admiration, for, mao, zedong, has, remained, widespread, in, china, in, spite, of, somewhat, general, knowledge, of, his, actions, in, december, 2013, a, global, times, poll, revealed, that, over, 85, of, chinese, viewed, mao, s, achievements, as, outweighing, his, mistakes, jan, plamper, argues, while, napoleon, iii, made, some, innovations, in, france, it, was, benito, mussolini, in, italy, in, the, 1920s, who, originated, the, model, of, dictator, as, cult, figure, that, was, emulated, by, hitler, stalin, and, the, others, using, the, propaganda, powers, of, a, totalitarian, state, pierre, du, bois, de, dunilac, argues, that, the, stalin, cult, was, elaborately, constructed, to, legitimize, his, rule, many, deliberate, distortions, and, falsehoods, were, used, the, kremlin, refused, access, to, archival, records, that, might, reveal, the, truth, and, key, documents, were, destroyed, photographs, were, altered, and, documents, were, invented, people, who, knew, stalin, were, forced, to, provide, official, accounts, to, meet, the, ideological, demands, of, the, cult, especially, as, stalin, himself, presented, it, in, 1938, in, short, course, on, the, history, of, the, all, union, communist, party, bolsheviks, which, became, the, official, history, historian, david, l, hoffmann, states, the, stalin, cult, was, a, central, element, of, stalinism, and, as, such, it, was, one, of, the, most, salient, features, of, soviet, rule, many, scholars, of, stalinism, cite, the, cult, as, integral, to, stalin, s, power, or, as, evidence, of, stalin, s, megalomania, in, latin, america, cas, mudde, and, crist, bal, rovira, kaltwasser, link, the, cult, of, the, leader, to, the, concept, of, the, caudillo, a, strong, leader, who, exercises, a, power, that, is, independent, of, any, office, and, free, of, any, constraint, these, populist, strongmen, are, portrayed, as, masculine, and, potentially, violent, and, enhance, their, authority, through, the, use, of, the, cult, of, personality, mudde, and, kaltwasser, trace, the, linkage, back, to, juan, per, n, of, argentina, juan, per, n, who, was, elected, three, times,

leader, adolf, hitler, as, a, demagogue, figure, who, was, the, almighty, defender, and, savior, of, germany, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, and, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, german, people, were, left, in, turmoil, under, the, weimar, republic, and, according, to, nazi, propaganda, only, hitler, could, save, them, and, restore, germany, s, greatness, which, in, turn, gave, rise, to, the, f, hrer, cult, during, the, five, election, campaigns, in, 1932, the, nazi, newspaper, v, lkischer, beobachter, portrayed, hitler, as, a, man, who, had, a, mass, movement, united, behind, him, a, man, with, one, mission, to, solely, save, germany, as, the, leader, of, the, coming, germany, the, night, of, the, long, knives, in, 1934, after, which, hitler, referred, to, himself, as, being, single, handedly, responsible, for, the, fate, of, the, german, people, also, helped, to, reinforce, the, myth, that, hitler, was, the, sole, protector, of, the, volksgemeinschaft, the, ethnic, community, of, the, german, people, nazi, propaganda, minister, joseph, goebbels, cultivated, an, image, of, hitler, as, a, heroic, genius, the, myth, also, gave, rise, to, the, saying, and, concept, if, only, the, f, hrer, knew, germans, thought, that, problems, which, they, ascribed, to, the, nazi, hierarchy, would, not, have, occurred, if, hitler, had, been, aware, of, the, situation, thus, nazi, bigwigs, were, blamed, and, hitler, escaped, criticism, british, historian, ian, kershaw, published, his, book, the, hitler, myth, image, and, reality, in, the, third, reich, in, 1987, and, wrote, hitler, stood, for, at, least, some, things, they, admired, and, for, many, had, become, the, symbol, and, embodiment, of, the, national, revival, which, the, third, reich, had, in, many, respects, been, perceived, to, accomplish, during, the, early, 1930s, the, myth, was, given, credence, due, to, hitler, s, perceived, ability, to, revive, the, german, economy, during, the, great, depression, however, albert, speer, wrote, that, by, 1939, the, myth, was, under, threat, and, the, nazis, had, to, organize, cheering, crowds, to, turn, up, to, events, speer, wrote, the, shift, in, the, mood, of, the, population, the, drooping, morale, which, began, to, be, felt, throughout, germany, in, 1939, was, evident, in, the, necessity, to, organize, cheering, crowds, where, two, years, earlier,

than, in, the, past, when, as, still, occasionally, happened, a, crowd, on, wilhelmsplatz, began, clamoring, for, him, to, appear, two, years, before, he, had, often, stepped, out, on, the, historic,

was, greatly, expanded, after, his, death, in, 1994, the, pervasiveness, and, the, extreme, nature, of, north, korea, s, personality, cult, surpasses, those, of, joseph, stalin, and, mao, zedong, the, cult, is, also, marked, by, the, intensity, of, the, people, s, feelings, for, and, devotion, to, their, leaders, and, the, key, role, played, by, a, confucianized, ideology, of, familism, both, in, maintaining, the, cult, and, thereby, in, sustaining, the, regime, itself, the, north, korean, cult, of, personality, is, a, large, part, of, juche, and, totalitarianism, yakov, novichenko, a, soviet,

that, political, scientists, have, compared, to, other, authoritarian, and, totalitarian, leaders, such, as, joseph, stalin, and, adolf, hitler, but, also, to, more, contemporary, dictators, such, as, suharto, in, indonesia, saddam, hussein, in, iraq, and, the, kim, dynasty, of, north, korea, p114, the, propaganda, techniques, used, either, by, himself, or, by, others, to, mythologize, ferdinand, marcos, began, with, local, political, machinations, in, ilocos, norte, while, ferdinand, was, still, the, young, son, of, politician, and, japanese, collaborator, mariano, marcos, and, persist, today, in, the, efforts, to, revise, the, way, marcos, is, portrayed, in, philippine, history, according, to, members, of, his, administration, such, as, adrian, cristobal, marcos, s, intent, was, to, project, an, image, of, himself, the, only, patron, the, king, of, philippine, society, which, he, still, saw, as, a, society, of, tribes, cristobal, furthers, that, marcos, and, the, first, lady, wanted, more, than, anything, else, to, be, king, and, queen, they, wished, to, shape, the, kingdom, in, their, own, image, marcos, wanted, to, be, able, to, say, l, tat, c, est, moi, in, some, extreme, cases, where, marcos, encouraged, the, formation, of, cults, so, that, they, could, serve, as, a, political, weapon, marcos, came, to, be, thought, of, as, a, god, these, propaganda, narratives, and, techniques, include, using, red, scare, tactics, such, as, red, tagging, to, portray, activists, as, communists, and, to, exaggerate, the, threat, represented, by, the, communist, party, of, the, philippines, 43, using, martial, law, to, take, control, of, mass, media, and, silence, criticism, the, use, of, foreign, funded, government, development, projects, and, construction, projects, as, propaganda, tools, creating, an, entire, propaganda, framework, around, a, new, society, in, which, he, would, rule, under, a, system, of, constitutional, authoritarianism, the, perpetuation, of, hagiographical, books, and, films, the, perpetuation, of, propaganda, narratives, about, marcos, s, activities, during, world, war, ii, which, have, since, been, proven, false, by, historical, documents, the, creation, of, myths, and, stories, around, himself, and, his, family, and, portrayals, of, himself, in, coinage, and, even, a, mount, rushmore, type, monument, among, others, the, first, cult, of, personality, to, take, shape, in, the, ussr, was, vladimir, lenin, up, until, the, dissolution, of, the, ussr, lenin, s, portrait, and, quotes, were, a, ubiquitous, part, of, the, culture, however, during, his, lifetime, lenin, vehemently, denounced, any, effort, to, build, a, cult, of, personality, as, in, his, eyes, the, cult, of, personality, was, antithetical, to, marxism, despite, this, members, of, the, communist, party, further, used, lenin, s, image, as, the, all, knowing, revolutionary, who, would, liberate, the, proletariat, lenin, attempted, to, take, action, against, this, however, it, was, halted, as, lenin, was, nearly, assassinated, in, august, 1918, his, health, would, only, further, decline, as, he, suffered, numerous, severe, strokes, with, the, worst, in, may, 1922, and, march, 1923, in, this, state, lenin, would, lose, the, ability, to, walk, and, speak, it, was, during, this, time, that, the, communist, party, began, to, promote, the, accomplishments, of, lenin, as, the, basis, for, his, cult, of, personality, using, him, as, an, image, of, morality, and, revolutionary, ideas, after, vladimir, lenin, s, death, in, 1924, and, the, exile, of, leon, trotsky, joseph, stalin, came, to, embody, the, soviet, union, once, lenin, s, cult, of, personality, had, risen, in, power, creating, enough, influence, stalin, integrated, his, ideals, into, his, own, cult, unlike, other, cults, of, personalities, the, lenin, and, stalin, cults, were, not, created, to, give, the, leaders, power, they, were, created, to, give, power, and, validation, to, the, communist, party, stalin, initially, spoke, out, against, the, cult, and, other, outrageous, and, false, claims, centered, around, him, however, stalin, s, attitude, began, to, shift, in, favor, of, the, cult, in, the, 1930s, and, he, began, to, encourage, it, following, the, great, purge, seldom, did, stalin, object, to, state, actions, that, furthered, his, cult, of, personality, however, he, did, oppose, some, initiatives, from, soviet, propagandists, when, nikolai, yezhov, proposed, to, rename, moscow, to, stalinodar, which, translates, to, gift, of, stalin, stalin, objected, to, merge, the, idea, of, the, lenin, and, stalin, cults, together, stalin, changed, aspects, of, lenin, s, life, in, the, public, s, eye, in, order, to, place, himself, in, power, this, kept, the, two, cults, in, a, line, that, showed, that, both, lenin, and, stalin, had, the, same, ideas, and, that, stalin, was, the, rightful, successor, of, lenin, leading, the, ussr, in, the, fashion, lenin, would, have, in, december, 1929, stalin, celebrated, his, 50th, birthday, which, made, stalin, become, a, prominent, feature, in, the, soviet, press, the, soviet, press, used, positive, adjectives, like, great, beloved, bold, wise, inspirer, and, genius, to, describe, him, similarly, speeches, that, were, given, by, people, to, the, peasants, described, stalin, as, our, best, collective, farm, worker, our, shockworker, our, best, of, best, and, our, darling, our, guiding, star, by, 1934, under, stalin, s, full, control, of, the, country, socialist, realism, became, the, endorsed, method, of, art, and, literature, even, under, the, communist, regime, the, stalin, cult, of, personality, portrayed, stalin, s, leadership, as, patriarchy, under, the, features, laid, out, during, khrushchev, s, speech, after, 1936, the, soviet, press, described, stalin, as, the, father, of, nations, one, key, element, of, soviet, propaganda, was, interactions, between, stalin, and, the, children, of, the, soviet, union, he, was, often, photographed, with, children, of, different, ethnic, backgrounds, of, the, soviet, union, and, was, often, photographed, giving, gifts, to, children, in, 1935, the, phrase, thank, you, dear, comrade, stalin, for, a, happy, childhood, started, to, appear, above, doorways, at, nurseries, orphanages, and, schools, children, also, chanted, this, slogan, at, festivals, another, key, element, of, soviet, propaganda, was, imagery, of, stalin, and, lenin, in, many, posters, stalin, and, lenin, were, placed, together, to, show, their, camaraderie, and, that, their, ideals, were, one, throughout, the, 1930s, posters, with, both, images, were, used, as, a, way, to, bring, the, nation, and, the, military, together, under, the, policies, of, the, communist, party, during, world, war, ii, with, the, idea, of, lenin, as, the, father, of, the, revolutionary, ideas, and, stalin, as, the, disciple, who, would, fulfill, the,
