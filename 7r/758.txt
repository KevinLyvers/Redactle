attention, or, focus, is, the, concentration, of, awareness, on, some, phenomenon, to, the, exclusion, of, other, stimuli, it, is, the, selective, concentration, on, discrete, information, either, subjectively, or, objectively, william, james, 1890, wrote, that, attention, is, the, taking, possession, by, the, mind, in, clear, and, vivid, form, of, one, out, of, what, seem, several, simultaneously, possible, objects, or, trains, of, thought, focalization, concentration, of, consciousness, are, of, its, essence, attention, has, also, been, described, as, the, allocation, of, limited, cognitive, processing, resources, attention, is, manifested, by, an, attentional, bottleneck, in, terms, of, the, amount, of, data, the, brain, can, process, each, second, for, example, in, human, vision, less, than, 1, of, the, visual, input, data, stream, of, 1mbyte, sec, can, enter, the, bottleneck, leading, to, inattentional, blindness, attention, remains, a, crucial, area, of, investigation, within, education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive, neuroscience, and, neuropsychology, areas, of, active, investigation, involve, determining, the, source, of, the, sensory, cues, and, signals, that, generate, attention, the, effects, of, these, sensory, cues, and, signals, on, the, tuning, properties, of, sensory, neurons, and, the, relationship, between, attention, and, other, behavioral, and, cognitive, processes, which, may, include, working, memory, and, psychological, vigilance, a, relatively, new, body, of, research, which, expands, upon, earlier, research, within, psychopathology, is, investigating, the, diagnostic, symptoms, associated, with, traumatic, brain, injury, and, its, effects, on, attention, attention, also, varies, across, cultures, the, relationships, between, attention, and, consciousness, are, complex, enough, that, they, have, warranted, philosophical, exploration, such, exploration, is, both, ancient, and, continually, relevant, as, it, can, have, effects, in, fields, ranging, from, mental, health, and, the, study, of, disorders, of, consciousness, to, artificial, intelligence, and, its, domains, of, research, prior, to, the, founding, of, psychology, as, a, scientific, discipline, attention, was, studied, in, the, field, of, philosophy, thus, many, of, the, discoveries, in, the, field, of, attention, were, made, by, philosophers, psychologist, john, b, watson, calls, juan, luis, vives, the, father, of, modern, psychology, because, in, his, book, de, anima, et, vita, the, soul, and, life, he, was, the, first, to, recognize, the, importance, of, empirical, investigation, in, his, work, on, memory, vives, found, that, the, more, closely, one, attends, to, stimuli, the, better, they, will, be, retained, by, the, 1990s, psychologists, began, using, positron, emission, tomography, pet, and, later, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, to, image, the, brain, while, monitoring, tasks, involving, attention, considering, this, expensive, equipment, was, generally, only, available, in, hospitals, psychologists, sought, cooperation, with, neurologists, psychologist, michael, posner, then, already, renowned, for, his, influential, work, on, visual, selective, attention, and, neurologist, marcus, raichle, pioneered, brain, imaging, studies, of, selective, attention, their, results, soon, sparked, interest, from, the, neuroscience, community, which, until, then, had, been, focused, on, monkey, brains, with, the, development, of, these, technological, innovations, neuroscientists, became, interested, in, this, type, of, research, that, combines, sophisticated, experimental, paradigms, from, cognitive, psychology, with, these, new, brain, imaging, techniques, although, the, older, technique, of, electroencephalography, eeg, had, long, been, used, to, study, the, brain, activity, underlying, selective, attention, by, cognitive, psychophysiologists, the, ability, of, the, newer, techniques, to, measure, precisely, localized, activity, inside, the, brain, generated, renewed, interest, by, a, wider, community, of, researchers, a, growing, body, of, such, neuroimaging, research, has, identified, a, frontoparietal, attention, network, which, appears, to, be, responsible, for, control, of, attention, a, definition, of, a, psychological, construct, forms, a, research, approach, to, its, study, in, scientific, works, attention, often, coincides, and, substitutes, the, notion, of, intentionality, due, to, the, extent, of, semantic, uncertainty, in, the, linguistic, explanations, of, these, notions, definitions, intentionality, has, in, turn, been, defined, as, the, power, of, minds, to, be, about, something, to, represent, or, to, stand, for, things, properties, and, states, of, affairs, although, these, two, psychological, constructs, attention, and, intentionality, appear, to, be, defined, by, similar, terms, they, are, different, notions, to, clarify, the, definition, of, attention, it, would, be, correct, to, consider, the, origin, of, this, notion, to, review, the, meaning, of, the, term, given, to, it, when, the, experimental, study, on, attention, was, initiated, it, is, thought, that, the, experimental, approach, began, with, famous, experiments, with, a, 4, x, 4, matrix, of, sixteen, randomly, chosen, letters, the, experimental, paradigm, that, informed, wundt, s, theory, of, attention, wundt, interpreted, the, experimental, outcome, introducing, the, meaning, of, attention, as, that, psychical, process, which, is, operative, in, the, clear, perception, of, the, narrow, region, of, the, content, of, consciousness, these, experiments, showed, the, physical, limits, of, attention, threshold, which, were, 3, 6, letters, observing, the, matrix, during, 1, 10, s, of, their, exposition, we, shall, call, the, entrance, into, the, large, region, of, consciousness, apprehension, and, the, elevation, into, the, focus, of, attention, apperception, wundt, s, theory, of, attention, postulated, one, of, the, main, features, of, this, notion, that, attention, is, an, active, voluntary, process, realized, during, a, certain, time, in, contrast, neuroscience, research, shows, that, intentionality, may, emerge, instantly, even, unconsciously, research, reported, to, register, neuronal, correlates, of, an, intentional, act, that, preceded, this, conscious, act, also, see, shared, intentionality, therefore, while, intentionality, is, a, mental, state, the, power, of, the, mind, to, be, about, something, arising, even, unconsciously, the, description, of, the, construct, of, attention, should, be, understood, in, the, dynamical, sense, as, the, ability, to, elevate, the, clear, perception, of, the, narrow, region, of, the, content, of, consciousness, and, to, keep, in, mind, this, state, for, a, time, the, attention, threshold, would, be, the, period, of, minimum, time, needed, for, employing, perception, to, clearly, apprehend, the, scope, of, intention, from, this, perspective, a, scientific, approach, to, attention, is, relevant, when, it, considers, the, difference, between, these, two, concepts, first, of, all, between, their, statical, and, dynamical, statuses, the, growing, body, of, literature, shows, empirical, evidence, that, attention, is, conditioned, by, the, number, of, elements, and, the, duration, of, exposition, decades, of, research, on, subitizing, have, supported, wundt, s, findings, about, the, limits, of, a, human, ability, to, concentrate, awareness, on, a, task, latvian, prof, sandra, mihailova, and, prof, igor, val, danilov, drew, an, essential, conclusion, from, the, wundtian, approach, to, the, study, of, attention, the, scope, of, attention, is, related, to, cognitive, development, as, the, mind, grasps, more, details, about, an, event, it, also, increases, the, number, of, reasonable, combinations, within, that, event, enhancing, the, probability, of, better, understanding, its, features, and, particularity, for, example, three, items, in, the, focal, point, of, consciousness, have, six, possible, combinations, 3, factorial, and, four, items, have, 24, 4, factorial, combinations, this, number, of, combinations, becomes, significantly, prominent, in, the, case, of, a, focal, point, with, six, items, with, 720, possible, combinations, 6, factorial, empirical, evidence, suggests, that, the, scope, of, attention, in, young, children, develops, from, two, items, in, the, focal, point, at, age, up, to, six, months, to, five, or, more, items, in, the, focal, point, at, age, about, five, years, in, cognitive, psychology, there, are, at, least, two, models, which, describe, how, visual, attention, operates, these, models, may, be, considered, metaphors, which, are, used, to, describe, internal, processes, and, to, generate, hypotheses, that, are, falsifiable, generally, speaking, visual, attention, is, thought, to, operate, as, a, two, stage, process, in, the, first, stage, attention, is, distributed, uniformly, over, the, external, visual, scene, and, processing, of, information, is, performed, in, parallel, in, the, second, stage, attention, is, concentrated, to, a, specific, area, of, the, visual, scene, i, e, it, is, focused, and, processing, is, performed, in, a, serial, fashion, the, first, of, these, models, to, appear, in, the, literature, is, the, spotlight, model, the, term, spotlight, was, inspired, by, the, work, of, william, james, who, described, attention, as, having, a, focus, a, margin, and, a, fringe, the, focus, is, an, area, that, extracts, information, from, the, visual, scene, with, a, high, resolution, the, geometric, center, of, which, being, where, visual, attention, is, directed, surrounding, the, focus, is, the, fringe, of, attention, which, extracts, information, in, a, much, more, crude, fashion, i, e, low, resolution, this, fringe, extends, out, to, a, specified, area, and, the, cut, off, is, called, the, margin, the, second, model, is, called, the, zoom, lens, model, and, was, first, introduced, in, 1986, this, model, inherits, all, properties, of, the, spotlight, model, i, e, the, focus, the, fringe, and, the, margin, but, it, has, the, added, property, of, changing, in, size, this, size, change, mechanism, was, inspired, by, the, zoom, lens, one, might, find, on, a, camera, and, any, change, in, size, can, be, described, by, a, trade, off, in, the, efficiency, of, processing, the, zoom, lens, of, attention, can, be, described, in, terms, of, an, inverse, trade, off, between, the, size, of, focus, and, the, efficiency, of, processing, because, attention, resources, are, assumed, to, be, fixed, then, it, follows, that, the, larger, the, focus, is, the, slower, processing, will, be, of, that, region, of, the, visual, scene, since, this, fixed, resource, will, be, distributed, over, a, larger, area, it, is, thought, that, the, focus, of, attention, can, subtend, a, minimum, of, 1, of, visual, angle, however, the, maximum, size, has, not, yet, been, determined, a, significant, debate, emerged, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 20th, century, in, which, treisman, s, 1993, feature, integration, theory, fit, was, compared, to, duncan, and, humphrey, s, 1989, attentional, engagement, theory, aet, 5, 7, fit, posits, that, objects, are, retrieved, from, scenes, by, means, of, selective, spatial, attention, that, picks, out, objects, features, forms, feature, maps, and, integrates, those, features, that, are, found, at, the, same, location, into, forming, objects, treismans, s, theory, is, based, on, a, two, stage, process, to, help, solve, the, binding, problem, of, attention, these, two, stages, are, the, preattentive, stage, and, the, focused, attention, stage, through, sequencing, these, steps, parallel, and, serial, search, is, better, exhibited, through, the, formation, of, conjunctions, of, objects, conjunctive, searches, according, to, treismans, are, done, through, both, stages, in, order, to, create, selective, and, focused, attention, on, an, object, though, duncan, and, humphrey, would, disagree, duncan, and, humphrey, s, aet, understanding, of, attention, maintained, that, there, is, an, initial, pre, attentive, parallel, phase, of, perceptual, segmentation, and, analysis, that, encompasses, all, of, the, visual, items, present, in, a, scene, at, this, phase, descriptions, of, the, objects, in, a, visual, scene, are, generated, into, structural, units, the, outcome, of, this, parallel, phase, is, a, multiple, spatial, scale, structured, representation, selective, attention, intervenes, after, this, stage, to, select, information, that, will, be, entered, into, visual, short, term, memory, 5, 7, the, contrast, of, the, two, theories, placed, a, new, emphasis, on, the, separation, of, visual, attention, tasks, alone, and, those, mediated, by, supplementary, cognitive, processes, as, rastophopoulos, summarizes, the, debate, against, treisman, s, fit, which, posits, spatial, attention, as, a, necessary, condition, for, detection, of, objects, humphreys, argues, that, visual, elements, are, encoded, and, bound, together, in, an, initial, parallel, phase, without, focal, attention, and, that, attention, serves, to, select, among, the, objects, that, result, from, this, initial, grouping, 8, in, the, twentieth, century, the, pioneering, research, of, lev, vygotsky, and, alexander, luria, led, to, the, three, part, model, of, neuropsychology, defining, the, working, brain, as, being, represented, by, three, co, active, processes, listed, as, attention, memory, and, activation, a, r, luria, published, his, well, known, book, the, working, brain, in, 1973, as, a, concise, adjunct, volume, to, his, previous, 1962, book, higher, cortical, functions, in, man, in, this, volume, luria, summarized, his, three, part, global, theory, of, the, working, brain, as, being, composed, of, three, constantly, co, active, processes, which, he, described, as, the, 1, attention, system, 2, mnestic, memory, system, and, 3, cortical, activation, system, the, two, books, together, are, considered, by, homskaya, s, account, as, among, luria, s, major, works, in, neuropsychology, most, fully, reflecting, all, the, aspects, theoretical, clinical, experimental, of, this, new, discipline, the, product, of, the, combined, research, of, vygotsky, and, luria, have, determined, a, large, part, of, the, contemporary, understanding, and, definition, of, attention, as, it, is, understood, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, multitasking, can, be, defined, as, the, attempt, to, perform, two, or, more, tasks, simultaneously, however, research, shows, that, when, multitasking, people, make, more, mistakes, or, perform, their, tasks, more, slowly, attention, must, be, divided, among, all, of, the, component, tasks, to, perform, them, in, divided, attention, individuals, attend, or, give, attention, to, multiple, sources, of, information, at, once, or, perform, more, than, one, task, at, the, same, time, older, research, involved, looking, at, the, limits, of, people, performing, simultaneous, tasks, like, reading, stories, while, listening, and, writing, something, else, or, listening, to, two, separate, messages, through, different, ears, i, e, dichotic, listening, generally, classical, research, into, attention, investigated, the, ability, of, people, to, learn, new, information, when, there, were, multiple, tasks, to, be, performed, or, to, probe, the, limits, of, our, perception, c, f, donald, broadbent, there, is, also, older, literature, on, people, s, performance, on, multiple, tasks, performed, simultaneously, such, as, driving, a, car, while, tuning, a, radio, or, driving, while, being, on, the, phone, the, vast, majority, of, current, research, on, human, multitasking, is, based, on, performance, of, doing, two, tasks, simultaneously, usually, that, involves, driving, while, performing, another, task, such, as, texting, eating, or, even, speaking, to, passengers, in, the, vehicle, or, with, a, friend, over, a, cellphone, this, research, reveals, that, the, human, attentional, system, has, limits, for, what, it, can, process, driving, performance, is, worse, while, engaged, in, other, tasks, drivers, make, more, mistakes, brake, harder, and, later, get, into, more, accidents, veer, into, other, lanes, and, or, are, less, aware, of, their, surroundings, when, engaged, in, the, previously, discussed, tasks, there, has, been, little, difference, found, between, speaking, on, a, hands, free, cell, phone, or, a, hand, held, cell, phone, which, suggests, that, it, is, the, strain, of, attentional, system, that, causes, problems, rather, than, what, the, driver, is, doing, with, his, or, her, hands, while, speaking, with, a, passenger, is, as, cognitively, demanding, as, speaking, with, a, friend, over, the, phone, passengers, are, able, to, change, the, conversation, based, upon, the, needs, of, the, driver, for, example, if, traffic, intensifies, a, passenger, may, stop, talking, to, allow, the, driver, to, navigate, the, increasingly, difficult, roadway, a, conversation, partner, over, a, phone, would, not, be, aware, of, the, change, in, environment, there, have, been, multiple, theories, regarding, divided, attention, one, conceived, by, cognitive, scientist, daniel, kahneman, explains, that, there, is, a, single, pool, of, attentional, resources, that, can, be, freely, divided, among, multiple, tasks, this, model, seems, oversimplified, however, due, to, the, different, modalities, e, g, visual, auditory, verbal, that, are, perceived, when, the, two, simultaneous, tasks, use, the, same, modality, such, as, listening, to, a, radio, station, and, writing, a, paper, it, is, much, more, difficult, to, concentrate, on, both, because, the, tasks, are, likely, to, interfere, with, each, other, the, specific, modality, model, was, theorized, by, cognitive, psychologists, david, navon, and, daniel, gopher, in, 1979, however, more, recent, research, using, well, controlled, dual, task, paradigms, points, at, the, importance, of, tasks, as, an, alternative, resource, theory, has, been, proposed, as, a, more, accurate, metaphor, for, explaining, divided, attention, on, complex, tasks, resource, theory, states, that, as, each, complex, task, is, automatized, performing, that, task, requires, less, of, the, individual, s, limited, capacity, attentional, resources, other, variables, play, a, part, in, our, ability, to, pay, attention, to, and, concentrate, on, many, tasks, at, once, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, anxiety, arousal, task, difficulty, and, skills, simultaneous, attention, is, a, type, of, attention, classified, by, attending, to, multiple, events, at, the, same, time, simultaneous, attention, is, demonstrated, by, children, in, indigenous, communities, who, learn, through, this, type, of, attention, to, their, surroundings, simultaneous, attention, is, present, in, the, ways, in, which, children, of, indigenous, backgrounds, interact, both, with, their, surroundings, and, with, other, individuals, simultaneous, attention, requires, focus, on, multiple, simultaneous, activities, or, occurrences, this, differs, from, multitasking, which, is, characterized, by, alternating, attention, and, focus, between, multiple, activities, or, halting, one, activity, before, switching, to, the, next, simultaneous, attention, involves, uninterrupted, attention, to, several, activities, occurring, at, the, same, time, another, cultural, practice, that, may, relate, to, simultaneous, attention, strategies, is, coordination, within, a, group, indigenous, heritage, toddlers, and, caregivers, in, san, pedro, were, observed, to, frequently, coordinate, their, activities, with, other, members, of, a, group, in, ways, parallel, to, a, model, of, simultaneous, attention, whereas, middle, class, european, descent, families, in, the, u, s, would, move, back, and, forth, between, events, research, concludes, that, children, with, close, ties, to, indigenous, american, roots, have, a, high, tendency, to, be, especially, wide, keen, observers, this, points, to, a, strong, cultural, difference, in, attention, management, attention, may, be, differentiated, into, overt, versus, covert, orienting, overt, orienting, is, the, act, of, selectively, attending, to, an, item, or, location, over, others, by, moving, the, eyes, to, point, in, that, direction, overt, orienting, can, be, directly, observed, in, the, form, of, eye, movements, although, overt, eye, movements, are, quite, common, there, is, a, distinction, that, can, be, made, between, two, types, of, eye, movements, reflexive, and, controlled, reflexive, movements, are, commanded, by, the, superior, colliculus, of, the, midbrain, these, movements, are, fast, and, are, activated, by, the, sudden, appearance, of, stimuli, in, contrast, controlled, eye, movements, are, commanded, by, areas, in, the, frontal, lobe, these, movements, are, slow, and, voluntary, covert, orienting, is, the, act, of, mentally, shifting, one, s, focus, without, moving, one, s, eyes, simply, it, is, changes, in, attention, that, are, not, attributable, to, overt, eye, movements, covert, orienting, has, the, potential, to, affect, the, output, of, perceptual, processes, by, governing, attention, to, particular, items, or, locations, for, example, the, activity, of, a, v4, neuron, whose, receptive, field, lies, on, an, attended, stimuli, will, be, enhanced, by, covert, attention, but, does, not, influence, the, information, that, is, processed, by, the, senses, researchers, often, use, filtering, tasks, to, study, the, role, of, covert, attention, of, selecting, information, these, tasks, often, require, participants, to, observe, a, number, of, stimuli, but, attend, to, only, one, the, current, view, is, that, visual, covert, attention, is, a, mechanism, for, quickly, scanning, the, field, of, view, for, interesting, locations, this, shift, in, covert, attention, is, linked, to, eye, movement, circuitry, that, sets, up, a, slower, saccade, to, that, location, there, are, studies, that, suggest, the, mechanisms, of, overt, and, covert, orienting, may, not, be, controlled, separately, and, independently, as, previously, believed, central, mechanisms, that, may, control, covert, orienting, such, as, the, parietal, lobe, also, receive, input, from, subcortical, centres, involved, in, overt, orienting, in, support, of, this, general, theories, of, attention, actively, assume, bottom, up, reflexive, processes, and, top, down, voluntary, processes, converge, on, a, common, neural, architecture, in, that, they, control, both, covert, and, overt, attentional, systems, for, example, if, individuals, attend, to, the, right, hand, corner, field, of, view, movement, of, the, eyes, in, that, direction, may, have, to, be, actively, suppressed, covert, attention, has, been, argued, to, reflect, the, existence, of, processes, programming, explicit, ocular, movement, however, this, has, been, questioned, on, the, grounds, that, n2, a, neural, measure, of, covert, attentional, allocation, does, not, always, precede, eye, movements, however, the, researchers, acknowledge, it, may, be, impossible, to, definitively, rule, out, the, possibility, that, some, kind, of, shift, of, covert, attention, precedes, every, shift, of, overt, attention, orienting, attention, is, vital, and, can, be, controlled, through, external, exogenous, or, internal, endogenous, processes, however, comparing, these, two, processes, is, challenging, because, external, signals, do, not, operate, completely, exogenously, but, will, only, summon, attention, and, eye, movements, if, they, are, important, to, the, subject, exogenous, from, greek, exo, meaning, outside, and, genein, meaning, to, produce, orienting, is, frequently, described, as, being, under, control, of, a, stimulus, exogenous, orienting, is, considered, to, be, reflexive, and, automatic, and, is, caused, by, a, sudden, change, in, the, periphery, this, often, results, in, a, reflexive, saccade, since, exogenous, cues, are, typically, presented, in, the, periphery, they, are, referred, to, as, peripheral, cues, exogenous, orienting, can, even, be, observed, when, individuals, are, aware, that, the, cue, will, not, relay, reliable, accurate, information, about, where, a, target, is, going, to, occur, this, means, that, the, mere, presence, of, an, exogenous, cue, will, affect, the, response, to, other, stimuli, that, are, subsequently, presented, in, the, cue, s, previous, location, several, studies, have, investigated, the, influence, of, valid, and, invalid, cues, they, concluded, that, valid, peripheral, cues, benefit, performance, for, instance, when, the, peripheral, cues, are, brief, flashes, at, the, relevant, location, before, the, onset, of, a, visual, stimulus, psychologists, michael, posner, and, yoav, cohen, 1984, noted, a, reversal, of, this, benefit, takes, place, when, the, interval, between, the, onset, of, the, cue, and, the, onset, of, the, target, is, longer, than, about, 300, ms, the, phenomenon, of, valid, cues, producing, longer, reaction, times, than, invalid, cues, is, called, inhibition, of, return, endogenous, from, greek, endo, meaning, within, or, internally, orienting, is, the, intentional, allocation, of, attentional, resources, to, a, predetermined, location, or, space, simply, stated, endogenous, orienting, occurs, when, attention, is, oriented, according, to, an, observer, s, goals, or, desires, allowing, the, focus, of, attention, to, be, manipulated, by, the, demands, of, a, task, in, order, to, have, an, effect, endogenous, cues, must, be, processed, by, the, observer, and, acted, upon, purposefully, these, cues, are, frequently, referred, to, as, central, cues, this, is, because, they, are, typically, presented, at, the, center, of, a, display, where, an, observer, s, eyes, are, likely, to, be, fixated, central, cues, such, as, an, arrow, or, digit, presented, at, fixation, tell, observers, to, attend, to, a, specific, location, when, examining, differences, between, exogenous, and, endogenous, orienting, some, researchers, suggest, that, there, are, four, differences, between, the, two, kinds, of, cues, there, exist, both, overlaps, and, differences, in, the, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, responsible, for, endogenous, and, exogenous, orientating, another, approach, to, this, discussion, has, been, covered, under, the, topic, heading, of, bottom, up, versus, top, down, orientations, to, attention, researchers, of, this, school, have, described, two, different, aspects, of, how, the, mind, focuses, attention, to, items, present, in, the, environment, the, first, aspect, is, called, bottom, up, processing, also, known, as, stimulus, driven, attention, or, exogenous, attention, these, describe, attentional, processing, which, is, driven, by, the, properties, of, the, objects, themselves, some, processes, such, as, motion, or, a, sudden, loud, noise, can, attract, our, attention, in, a, pre, conscious, or, non, volitional, way, we, attend, to, them, whether, we, want, to, or, not, these, aspects, of, attention, are, thought, to, involve, parietal, and, temporal, cortices, as, well, as, the, brainstem, more, recent, experimental, evidence, support, the, idea, that, the, primary, visual, cortex, creates, a, bottom, up, saliency, map, which, is, received, by, the, superior, colliculus, in, the, midbrain, area, to, guide, attention, or, gaze, shifts, the, second, aspect, is, called, top, down, processing, also, known, as, goal, driven, endogenous, attention, attentional, control, or, executive, attention, this, aspect, of, our, attentional, orienting, is, under, the, control, of, the, person, who, is, attending, it, is, mediated, primarily, by, the, frontal, cortex, and, basal, ganglia, as, one, of, the, executive, functions, research, has, shown, that, it, is, related, to, other, aspects, of, the, executive, functions, such, as, working, memory, and, conflict, resolution, and, inhibition, a, hugely, influential, theory, regarding, selective, attention, is, the, perceptual, load, theory, which, states, that, there, are, two, mechanisms, that, affect, attention, cognitive, and, perceptual, the, perceptual, mechanism, considers, the, subject, s, ability, to, perceive, or, ignore, stimuli, both, task, related, and, non, task, related, studies, show, that, if, there, are, many, stimuli, present, especially, if, they, are, task, related, it, is, much, easier, to, ignore, the, non, task, related, stimuli, but, if, there, are, few, stimuli, the, mind, will, perceive, the, irrelevant, stimuli, as, well, as, the, relevant, the, cognitive, mechanism, refers, to, the, actual, processing, of, the, stimuli, studies, regarding, this, showed, that, the, ability, to, process, stimuli, decreased, with, age, meaning, that, younger, people, were, able, to, perceive, more, stimuli, and, fully, process, them, but, were, likely, to, process, both, relevant, and, irrelevant, information, while, older, people, could, process, fewer, stimuli, but, usually, processed, only, relevant, information, some, people, can, process, multiple, stimuli, e, g, trained, morse, code, operators, have, been, able, to, copy, 100, of, a, message, while, carrying, on, a, meaningful, conversation, this, relies, on, the, reflexive, response, due, to, overlearning, the, skill, of, morse, code, reception, detection, transcription, so, that, it, is, an, autonomous, function, requiring, no, specific, attention, to, perform, this, overtraining, of, the, brain, comes, as, the, practice, of, a, skill, 100, accuracy, allowing, the, activity, to, become, autonomic, while, your, mind, has, room, to, process, other, actions, simultaneously, based, on, the, primary, role, of, the, perceptual, load, theory, assumptions, regarding, its, functionality, surrounding, that, attentional, resources, are, that, of, limited, capacity, which, signify, the, need, for, all, of, the, attentional, resources, to, be, used, this, performance, however, is, halted, when, put, hand, in, hand, with, accuracy, and, reaction, time, rt, this, limitation, arises, through, the, measurement, of, literature, when, obtaining, outcomes, for, scores, this, affects, both, cognitive, and, perceptual, attention, because, there, is, a, lack, of, measurement, surrounding, distributions, of, temporal, and, spatial, attention, only, a, concentrated, amount, of, attention, on, how, effective, one, is, completing, the, task, and, how, long, they, take, is, being, analyzed, making, a, more, redundant, analysis, on, overall, cognition, of, being, able, to, process, multiple, stimuli, through, perception, attention, is, best, described, as, the, sustained, focus, of, cognitive, resources, on, information, while, filtering, or, ignoring, extraneous, information, attention, is, a, very, basic, function, that, often, is, a, precursor, to, all, other, neurological, cognitive, functions, as, is, frequently, the, case, clinical, models, of, attention, differ, from, investigation, models, one, of, the, most, used, models, for, the, evaluation, of, attention, in, patients, with, very, different, neurologic, pathologies, is, the, model, of, sohlberg, and, mateer, this, hierarchic, model, is, based, in, the, recovering, of, attention, processes, of, brain, damage, patients, after, coma, five, different, kinds, of, activities, of, growing, difficulty, are, described, in, the, model, connecting, with, the, activities, those, patients, could, do, as, their, recovering, process, advanced, this, model, has, been, shown, to, be, very, useful, in, evaluating, attention, in, very, different, pathologies, correlates, strongly, with, daily, difficulties, and, is, especially, helpful, in, designing, stimulation, programs, such, as, attention, process, training, a, rehabilitation, program, for, neurological, patients, of, the, same, authors, most, experiments, show, that, one, neural, correlate, of, attention, is, enhanced, firing, if, a, neuron, has, a, different, response, to, a, stimulus, when, an, animal, is, not, attending, to, a, stimulus, versus, when, the, animal, does, attend, to, the, stimulus, then, the, neuron, s, response, will, be, enhanced, even, if, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, stimulus, remain, the, same, in, a, 2007, review, professor, eric, knudsen, describes, a, more, general, model, which, identifies, four, core, processes, of, attention, with, working, memory, at, the, center, neurally, at, different, hierarchical, levels, spatial, maps, can, enhance, or, inhibit, activity, in, sensory, areas, and, induce, orienting, behaviors, like, eye, movement, in, many, cases, attention, produces, changes, in, the, eeg, many, animals, including, humans, produce, gamma, waves, 40, 60, hz, when, focusing, attention, on, a, particular, object, or, activity, another, commonly, used, model, for, the, attention, system, has, been, put, forth, by, researchers, such, as, michael, posner, he, divides, attention, into, three, functional, components, alerting, orienting, and, executive, attention, that, can, also, interact, and, influence, each, other, children, appear, to, develop, patterns, of, attention, related, to, the, cultural, practices, of, their, families, communities, and, the, institutions, in, which, they, participate, in, 1955, jules, henry, suggested, that, there, are, societal, differences, in, sensitivity, to, signals, from, many, ongoing, sources, that, call, for, the, awareness, of, several, levels, of, attention, simultaneously, he, tied, his, speculation, to, ethnographic, observations, of, communities, in, which, children, are, involved, in, a, complex, social, community, with, multiple, relationships, many, indigenous, children, in, the, americas, predominantly, learn, by, observing, and, pitching, in, there, are, several, studies, to, support, that, the, use, of, keen, attention, towards, learning, is, much, more, common, in, indigenous, communities, of, north, and, central, america, than, in, a, middle, class, european, american, setting, this, is, a, direct, result, of, the, learning, by, observing, and, pitching, in, model, keen, attention, is, both, a, requirement, and, result, of, learning, by, observing, and, pitching, in, incorporating, the, children, in, the, community, gives, them, the, opportunity, to, keenly, observe, and, contribute, to, activities, that, were, not, directed, towards, them, it, can, be, seen, from, different, indigenous, communities, and, cultures, such, as, the, mayans, of, san, pedro, that, children, can, simultaneously, attend, to, multiple, events, most, maya, children, have, learned, to, pay, attention, to, several, events, at, once, in, order, to, make, useful, observations, one, example, is, simultaneous, attention, which, involves, uninterrupted, attention, to, several, activities, occurring, at, the, same, time, another, cultural, practice, that, may, relate, to, simultaneous, attention, strategies, is, coordination, within, a, group, san, pedro, toddlers, and, caregivers, frequently, coordinated, their, activities, with, other, members, of, a, group, in, multiway, engagements, rather, than, in, a, dyadic, fashion, research, concludes, that, children, with, close, ties, to, indigenous, american, roots, have, a, high, tendency, to, be, especially, keen, observers, this, learning, by, observing, and, pitching, in, model, requires, active, levels, of, attention, management, the, child, is, present, while, caretakers, engage, in, daily, activities, and, responsibilities, such, as, weaving, farming, and, other, skills, necessary, for, survival, being, present, allows, the, child, to, focus, their, attention, on, the, actions, being, performed, by, their, parents, elders, and, or, older, siblings, in, order, to, learn, in, this, way, keen, attention, and, focus, is, required, eventually, the, child, is, expected, to, be, able, to, perform, these, skills, themselves, in, the, domain, of, computer, vision, efforts, have, been, made, to, model, the, mechanism, of, human, attention, especially, the, bottom, up, intentional, mechanism, and, its, semantic, significance, in, classification, of, video, contents, both, spatial, attention, and, temporal, attention, have, been, incorporated, in, such, classification, efforts, generally, speaking, there, are, two, kinds, of, models, to, mimic, the, bottom, up, salience, mechanism, in, static, images, one, is, based, on, the, spatial, contrast, analysis, for, example, a, center, surround, mechanism, has, been, used, to, define, salience, across, scales, inspired, by, the, putative, neural, mechanism, it, has, also, been, hypothesized, that, some, visual, inputs, are, intrinsically, salient, in, certain, background, contexts, and, that, these, are, actually, task, independent, this, model, has, established, itself, as, the, exemplar, for, salience, detection, and, consistently, used, for, comparison, in, the, literature, the, other, kind, of, model, is, based, on, the, frequency, domain, analysis, this, method, was, first, proposed, by, hou, et, al, this, method, was, called, sr, then, the, pqft, method, was, also, introduced, both, sr, and, pqft, only, use, the, phase, information, in, 2012, the, hft, method, was, introduced, and, both, the, amplitude, and, the, phase, information, are, made, use, of, the, neural, abstraction, pyramid, is, a, hierarchical, recurrent, convolutional, model, which, incorporates, bottom, up, and, top, down, flow, of, information, to, iteratively, interpret, images, hemispatial, neglect, also, called, unilateral, neglect, often, occurs, when, people, have, damage, to, the, right, hemisphere, of, their, brain, this, damage, often, leads, to, a, tendency, to, ignore, the, left, side, of, one, s, body, or, even, the, left, side, of, an, object, that, can, be, seen, damage, to, the, left, side, of, the, brain, the, left, hemisphere, rarely, yields, significant, neglect, of, the, right, side, of, the, body, or, object, in, the, person, s, local, environments, the, effects, of, spatial, neglect, however, may, vary, and, differ, depending, on, what, area, of, the, brain, was, damaged, damage, to, different, neural, substrates, can, result, in, different, types, of, neglect, attention, disorders, lateralized, and, nonlaterized, may, also, contribute, to, the, symptoms, and, effects, much, research, has, asserted, that, damage, to, gray, matter, within, the, brain, results, in, spatial, neglect, new, technology, has, yielded, more, information, such, that, there, is, a, large, distributed, network, of, frontal, parietal, temporal, and, subcortical, brain, areas, that, have, been, tied, to, neglect, this, network, can, be, related, to, other, research, as, well, the, dorsal, attention, network, is, tied, to, spatial, orienting, the, effect, of, damage, to, this, network, may, result, in, patients, neglecting, their, left, side, when, distracted, about, their, right, side, or, an, object, on, their, right, side, social, attention, is, one, special, form, of, attention, that, involves, the, allocation, of, limited, processing, resources, in, a, social, context, previous, studies, on, social, attention, often, regard, how, attention, is, directed, toward, socially, relevant, stimuli, such, as, faces, and, gaze, directions, of, other, individuals, in, contrast, to, attending, to, others, a, different, line, of, researches, has, shown, that, self, related, information, such, as, own, face, and, name, automatically, captures, attention, and, is, preferentially, processed, comparing, to, other, related, information, these, contrasting, effects, between, attending, to, others, and, attending, to, self, prompt, a, synthetic, view, in, a, recent, opinion, article, proposing, that, social, attention, operates, at, two, polarizing, states, in, one, extreme, individual, tends, to, attend, to, the, self, and, prioritize, self, related, information, over, others, and, in, the, other, extreme, attention, is, allocated, to, other, individuals, to, infer, their, intentions, and, desires, attending, to, self, and, attending, to, others, mark, the, two, ends, of, an, otherwise, continuum, spectrum, of, social, attention, for, a, given, behavioral, context, the, mechanisms, underlying, these, two, polarities, might, interact, and, compete, with, each, other, in, order, to, determine, a, saliency, map, of, social, attention, that, guides, our, behaviors, an, imbalanced, competition, between, these, two, behavioral, and, cognitive, processes, will, cause, cognitive, disorders, and, neurological, symptoms, such, as, autism, spectrum, disorders, and, williams, syndrome, according, to, daniel, goleman, s, book, focus, the, hidden, driver, of, excellence, there, are, two, types, of, distracting, factors, affecting, focus, sensory, and, emotional, a, sensory, distracting, factor, would, be, for, example, while, a, person, is, reading, this, article, they, are, neglecting, the, white, field, surrounding, the, text, an, emotional, distracting, factor, would, be, when, someone, is, focused, on, answering, an, email, and, somebody, shouts, their, name, it, would, be, almost, impossible, to, neglect, the, voice, speaking, it, attention, is, immediately, directed, toward, the, source, positive, emotions, have, also, been, found, to, affect, attention, induction, of, happiness, has, led, to, increased, response, times, and, an, increase, in, inaccurate, responses, in, the, face, of, irrelevant, stimuli, two, possible, theories, as, to, why, emotions, might, make, one, more, susceptible, to, distracting, stimuli, is, that, emotions, take, up, too, much, of, one, s, cognitive, resources, and, make, it, harder, to, control, your, focus, of, attention, the, other, theory, is, that, emotions, make, it, harder, to, filter, out, distractions, specifically, with, positive, emotions, due, to, a, feeling, of, security, another, distracting, factor, to, attention, processes, is, insufficient, sleep, sleep, deprivation, is, found, to, impair, cognition, specifically, performance, in, divided, attention, divided, attention, is, possibly, linked, with, the, circadian, processes, inattentional, blindness, was, first, introduced, in, 1998, by, arien, mack, and, irvic, rock, their, studies, show, that, when, people, are, focused, on, specific, stimuli, they, often, miss, other, stimuli, that, are, clearly, present, though, actual, blindness, is, not, occurring, here, the, blindness, that, happens, is, due, to, the, perceptual, load, of, what, is, being, attended, to, based, on, the, experiment, performed, by, mack, and, rock, ula, finch, and, nilli, lavie, tested, participants, with, a, perceptual, task, they, presented, subjects, with, a, cross, one, arm, being, longer, than, the, other, for, 5, trials, on, the, sixth, trial, a, white, square, was, added, to, the, top, left, of, the, screen, the, results, conclude, that, out, of, 10, participants, only, 2, 20, actually, saw, the, square, this, would, suggest, that, when, a, higher, focus, was, attended, to, the, length, of, the, crossed, arms, the, more, likely, someone, would, altogether, miss, an, object, that, was, in, plain, sight, change, blindness, was, first, tested, by, rensink, and, coworkers, in, 1997, their, studies, show, that, people, have, difficulty, detecting, changes, from, scene, to, scene, due, to, the, intense, focus, on, one, thing, or, lack, of, attention, overall, this, was, tested, by, rensink, through, a, presentation, of, a, picture, and, then, a, blank, field, and, then, the, same, picture, but, with, an, item, missing, the, results, showed, that, the, pictures, had, to, be, alternated, back, and, forth, a, good, number, of, times, for, participants, to, notice, the, difference, this, idea, is, greatly, portrayed, in, films, that, have, continuity, errors, many, people, do, not, pick, up, on, differences, when, in, reality, the, changes, tend, to, be, significant, psychologist, daniel, e, berlyne, credits, the, first, extended, treatment, of, attention, to, philosopher, nicolas, malebranche, in, his, work, the, search, after, truth, malebranche, held, that, we, have, access, to, ideas, or, mental, representations, of, the, external, world, but, not, direct, access, to, the, world, itself, thus, in, order, to, keep, these, ideas, organized, attention, is, necessary, otherwise, we, will, confuse, these, ideas, malebranche, writes, in, the, search, after, truth, because, it, often, happens, that, the, understanding, has, only, confused, and, imperfect, perceptions, of, things, it, is, truly, a, cause, of, our, errors, it, is, therefore, necessary, to, look, for, means, to, keep, our, perceptions, from, being, confused, and, imperfect, and, because, as, everyone, knows, there, is, nothing, that, makes, them, clearer, and, more, distinct, than, attentiveness, we, must, try, to, find, the, means, to, become, more, attentive, than, we, are, according, to, malebranche, attention, is, crucial, to, understanding, and, keeping, thoughts, organized, philosopher, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, introduced, the, concept, of, apperception, to, this, philosophical, approach, to, attention, apperception, refers, to, the, process, by, which, new, experience, is, assimilated, to, and, transformed, by, the, residuum, of, past, experience, of, an, individual, to, form, a, new, whole, apperception, is, required, for, a, perceived, event, to, become, a, conscious, event, leibniz, emphasized, a, reflexive, involuntary, view, of, attention, known, as, exogenous, orienting, however, there, is, also, endogenous, orienting, which, is, voluntary, and, directed, attention, philosopher, johann, friedrich, herbart, agreed, with, leibniz, s, view, of, apperception, however, he, expounded, on, it, in, by, saying, that, new, experiences, had, to, be, tied, to, ones, already, existing, in, the, mind, herbart, was, also, the, first, person, to, stress, the, importance, of, applying, mathematical, modeling, to, the, study, of, psychology, throughout, the, philosophical, era, various, thinkers, made, significant, contributions, to, the, field, of, attention, studies, beginning, with, research, on, the, extent, of, attention, and, how, attention, is, directed, in, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, thought, that, people, were, not, able, to, attend, to, more, than, one, stimulus, at, a, time, however, with, research, contributions, by, sir, william, hamilton, 9th, baronet, this, view, was, changed, hamilton, proposed, a, view, of, attention, that, likened, its, capacity, to, holding, marbles, you, can, only, hold, a, certain, number, of, marbles, at, a, time, before, it, starts, to, spill, over, his, view, states, that, we, can, attend, to, more, than, one, stimulus, at, once, william, stanley, jevons, later, expanded, this, view, and, stated, that, we, can, attend, to, up, to, four, items, at, a, time, this, period, of, attention, research, took, the, focus, from, conceptual, findings, to, experimental, testing, it, also, involved, psychophysical, methods, that, allowed, measurement, of, the, relation, between, physical, stimulus, properties, and, the, psychological, perceptions, of, them, this, period, covers, the, development, of, attentional, research, from, the, founding, of, psychology, to, 1909, wilhelm, wundt, introduced, the, study, of, attention, to, the, field, of, psychology, wundt, measured, mental, processing, speed, by, likening, it, to, differences, in, stargazing, measurements, astronomers, in, this, time, would, measure, the, time, it, took, for, stars, to, travel, among, these, measurements, when, astronomers, recorded, the, times, there, were, personal, differences, in, calculation, these, different, readings, resulted, in, different, reports, from, each, astronomer, to, correct, for, this, a, personal, equation, was, developed, wundt, applied, this, to, mental, processing, speed, wundt, realized, that, the, time, it, takes, to, see, the, stimulus, of, the, star, and, write, down, the, time, was, being, called, an, observation, error, but, actually, was, the, time, it, takes, to, switch, voluntarily, one, s, attention, from, one, stimulus, to, another, wundt, called, his, school, of, psychology, voluntarism, it, was, his, belief, that, psychological, processes, can, only, be, understood, in, terms, of, goals, and, consequences, franciscus, donders, used, mental, chronometry, to, study, attention, and, it, was, considered, a, major, field, of, intellectual, inquiry, by, authors, such, as, sigmund, freud, donders, and, his, students, conducted, the, first, detailed, investigations, of, the, speed, of, mental, processes, donders, measured, the, time, required, to, identify, a, stimulus, and, to, select, a, motor, response, this, was, the, time, difference, between, stimulus, discrimination, and, response, initiation, donders, also, formalized, the, subtractive, method, which, states, that, the, time, for, a, particular, process, can, be, estimated, by, adding, that, process, to, a, task, and, taking, the, difference, in, reaction, time, between, the, two, tasks, he, also, differentiated, between, three, types, of, reactions, simple, reaction, choice, reaction, and, go, no, go, reaction, hermann, von, helmholtz, also, contributed, to, the, field, of, attention, relating, to, the, extent, of, attention, von, helmholtz, stated, that, it, is, possible, to, focus, on, one, stimulus, and, still, perceive, or, ignore, others, an, example, of, this, is, being, able, to, focus, on, the, letter, u, in, the, word, house, and, still, perceiving, the, letters, h, o, s, and, e, one, major, debate, in, this, period, was, whether, it, was, possible, to, attend, to, two, things, at, once, split, attention, walter, benjamin, described, this, experience, as, reception, in, a, state, of, distraction, this, disagreement, could, only, be, resolved, through, experimentation, in, 1890, william, james, in, his, textbook, the, principles, of, psychology, remarked, everyone, knows, what, attention, is, it, is, the, taking, possession, by, the, mind, in, clear, and, vivid, form, of, one, out, of, what, seem, several, simultaneously, possible, objects, or, trains, of, thought, focalization, concentration, of, consciousness, are, of, its, essence, it, implies, withdrawal, from, some, things, in, order, to, deal, effectively, with, others, and, is, a, condition, which, has, a, real, opposite, in, the, confused, dazed, scatterbrained, state, which, in, french, is, called, distraction, and, zerstreutheit, in, german, james, differentiated, between, sensorial, attention, and, intellectual, attention, sensorial, attention, is, when, attention, is, directed, to, objects, of, sense, stimuli, that, are, physically, present, intellectual, attention, is, attention, directed, to, ideal, or, represented, objects, stimuli, that, are, not, physically, present, james, also, distinguished, between, immediate, or, derived, attention, attention, to, the, present, versus, to, something, not, physically, present, according, to, james, attention, has, five, major, effects, attention, works, to, make, us, perceive, conceive, distinguish, remember, and, shorten, reactions, time, during, this, period, research, in, attention, waned, and, interest, in, behaviorism, flourished, leading, some, to, believe, like, ulric, neisser, that, in, this, period, there, was, no, research, on, attention, however, jersild, published, very, important, work, on, mental, set, and, shift, in, 1927, he, stated, the, fact, of, mental, set, is, primary, in, all, conscious, activity, the, same, stimulus, may, evoke, any, one, of, a, large, number, of, responses, depending, upon, the, contextual, setting, in, which, it, is, placed, this, research, found, that, the, time, to, complete, a, list, was, longer, for, mixed, lists, than, for, pure, lists, for, example, if, a, list, was, names, of, animals, versus, a, list, of, the, same, size, with, names, of, animals, books, makes, and, models, of, cars, and, types, of, fruits, it, takes, longer, to, process, the, second, list, this, is, task, switching, in, 1931, telford, discovered, the, psychological, refractory, period, the, stimulation, of, neurons, is, followed, by, a, refractory, phase, during, which, neurons, are, less, sensitive, to, stimulation, in, 1935, john, ridley, stroop, developed, the, stroop, task, which, elicited, the, stroop, effect, stroop, s, task, showed, that, irrelevant, stimulus, information, can, have, a, major, impact, on, performance, in, this, task, subjects, were, to, look, at, a, list, of, colors, this, list, of, colors, had, each, color, typed, in, a, color, different, from, the, actual, text, for, example, the, word, blue, would, be, typed, in, orange, pink, in, black, and, so, on, example, blue, purple, red, green, purple, green, subjects, were, then, instructed, to, say, the, name, of, the, ink, color, and, ignore, the, text, it, took, 110, seconds, to, complete, a, list, of, this, type, compared, to, 63, seconds, to, name, the, colors, when, presented, in, the, form, of, solid, squares, the, naming, time, nearly, doubled, in, the, presence, of, conflicting, color, words, an, effect, known, as, the, stroop, effect, in, the, 1950s, research, psychologists, renewed, their, interest, in, attention, when, the, dominant, epistemology, shifted, from, positivism, i, e, behaviorism, to, realism, during, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, cognitive, revolution, the, cognitive, revolution, admitted, unobservable, cognitive, processes, like, attention, as, legitimate, objects, of, scientific, study, modern, research, on, attention, began, with, the, analysis, of, the, cocktail, party, problem, by, colin, cherry, in, 1953, at, a, cocktail, party, how, do, people, select, the, conversation, that, they, are, listening, to, and, ignore, the, rest, this, problem, is, at, times, called, focused, attention, as, opposed, to, divided, attention, cherry, performed, a, number, of, experiments, which, became, known, as, dichotic, listening, and, were, extended, by, donald, broadbent, and, others, 112, in, a, typical, experiment, subjects, would, use, a, set, of, headphones, to, listen, to, two, streams, of, words, in, different, ears, and, selectively, attend, to, one, stream, after, the, task, the, experimenter, would, question, the, subjects, about, the, content, of, the, unattended, stream, broadbent, s, filter, model, of, attention, states, that, information, is, held, in, a, pre, attentive, temporary, store, and, only, sensory, events, that, have, some, physical, feature, in, common, are, selected, to, pass, into, the, limited, capacity, processing, system, this, implies, that, the, meaning, of, unattended, messages, is, not, identified, also, a, significant, amount, of, time, is, required, to, shift, the, filter, from, one, channel, to, another, experiments, by, gray, and, wedderburn, and, later, anne, treisman, pointed, out, various, problems, in, broadbent, s, early, model, and, eventually, led, to, the, deutsch, norman, model, in, 1968, in, this, model, no, signal, is, filtered, out, but, all, are, processed, to, the, point, of, activating, their, stored, representations, in, memory, the, point, at, which, attention, becomes, selective, is, when, one, of, the, memory, representations, is, selected, for, further, processing, at, any, time, only, one, can, be, selected, resulting, in, the, attentional, bottleneck, 115, 116, this, debate, became, known, as, the, early, selection, vs, late, selection, models, in, the, early, selection, models, first, proposed, by, donald, broadbent, attention, shuts, down, in, broadbent, s, model, or, attenuates, in, treisman, s, refinement, processing, in, the, unattended, ear, before, the, mind, can, analyze, its, semantic, content, in, the, late, selection, models, first, proposed, by, j, anthony, deutsch, and, diana, deutsch, the, content, in, both, ears, is, analyzed, semantically, but, the, words, in, the, unattended, ear, cannot, access, consciousness, lavie, s, perceptual, load, theory, however, provided, elegant, solution, to, what, had, once, been, a, heated, debate
