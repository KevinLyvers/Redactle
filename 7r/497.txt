forensic, science, also, known, as, criminalistics, is, the, application, of, science, principles, and, methods, to, support, legal, decision, making, in, matters, of, criminal, and, civil, law, during, criminal, investigation, in, particular, it, is, governed, by, the, legal, standards, of, admissible, evidence, and, criminal, procedure, it, is, a, broad, field, utilizing, numerous, practices, such, as, the, analysis, of, dna, fingerprints, bloodstain, patterns, firearms, ballistics, toxicology, microscopy, and, fire, debris, analysis, forensic, scientists, collect, preserve, and, analyze, evidence, during, the, course, of, an, investigation, while, some, forensic, scientists, travel, to, the, scene, of, the, crime, to, collect, the, evidence, themselves, others, occupy, a, laboratory, role, performing, analysis, on, objects, brought, to, them, by, other, individuals, others, are, involved, in, analysis, of, financial, banking, or, other, numerical, data, for, use, in, financial, crime, investigation, and, can, be, employed, as, consultants, from, private, firms, academia, or, as, government, employees, in, addition, to, their, laboratory, role, forensic, scientists, testify, as, expert, witnesses, in, both, criminal, and, civil, cases, and, can, work, for, either, the, prosecution, or, the, defense, while, any, field, could, technically, be, forensic, certain, sections, have, developed, over, time, to, encompass, the, majority, of, forensically, related, cases, the, term, forensic, stems, from, the, latin, word, for, nsis, 3rd, declension, adjective, meaning, of, a, forum, place, of, assembly, the, history, of, the, term, originates, in, roman, times, when, a, criminal, charge, meant, presenting, the, case, before, a, group, of, public, individuals, in, the, forum, both, the, person, accused, of, the, crime, and, the, accuser, would, give, speeches, based, on, their, sides, of, the, story, the, case, would, be, decided, in, favor, of, the, individual, with, the, best, argument, and, delivery, this, origin, is, the, source, of, the, two, modern, usages, of, the, word, forensic, as, a, form, of, legal, evidence, and, as, a, category, of, public, presentation, in, modern, use, the, term, forensics, is, often, used, in, place, of, forensic, science, the, word, science, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, knowledge, and, is, today, closely, tied, to, the, scientific, method, a, systematic, way, of, acquiring, knowledge, taken, together, forensic, science, means, the, use, of, scientific, methods, and, processes, for, crime, solving, the, ancient, world, lacked, standardized, forensic, practices, which, enabled, criminals, to, escape, punishment, criminal, investigations, and, trials, relied, heavily, on, forced, confessions, and, witness, testimony, however, ancient, sources, do, contain, several, accounts, of, techniques, that, foreshadow, concepts, in, forensic, science, developed, centuries, later, the, first, written, account, of, using, medicine, and, entomology, to, solve, criminal, cases, is, attributed, to, the, book, of, xi, yuan, lu, translated, as, washing, away, of, wrongs, written, in, china, in, 1248, by, song, ci, 1186, 1249, a, director, of, justice, jail, and, supervision, during, the, song, dynasty, song, ci, introduced, regulations, concerning, autopsy, reports, to, court, how, to, protect, the, evidence, in, the, examining, process, and, explained, why, forensic, workers, must, demonstrate, impartiality, to, the, public, he, devised, methods, for, making, antiseptic, and, for, promoting, the, reappearance, of, hidden, injuries, to, dead, bodies, and, bones, using, sunlight, and, vinegar, under, a, red, oil, umbrella, for, calculating, the, time, of, death, allowing, for, weather, and, insect, activity, described, how, to, wash, and, examine, the, dead, body, to, ascertain, the, reason, for, death, at, that, time, the, book, had, described, methods, for, distinguishing, between, suicide, and, faked, suicide, he, wrote, the, book, on, forensics, stating, that, all, wounds, or, dead, bodies, should, be, examined, not, avoided, the, book, became, the, first, form, of, literature, to, help, determine, the, cause, of, death, in, one, of, song, ci, s, accounts, washing, away, of, wrongs, the, case, of, a, person, murdered, with, a, sickle, was, solved, by, an, investigator, who, instructed, each, suspect, to, bring, his, sickle, to, one, location, he, realized, it, was, a, sickle, by, testing, various, blades, on, an, animal, carcass, and, comparing, the, wounds, flies, attracted, by, the, smell, of, blood, eventually, gathered, on, a, single, sickle, in, light, of, this, the, owner, of, that, sickle, confessed, to, the, murder, the, book, also, described, how, to, distinguish, between, a, drowning, water, in, the, lungs, and, strangulation, broken, neck, cartilage, and, described, evidence, from, examining, corpses, to, determine, if, a, death, was, caused, by, murder, suicide, or, accident, methods, from, around, the, world, involved, saliva, and, examination, of, the, mouth, and, tongue, to, determine, innocence, or, guilt, as, a, precursor, to, the, polygraph, test, in, ancient, india, some, suspects, were, made, to, fill, their, mouths, with, dried, rice, and, spit, it, back, out, similarly, in, ancient, china, those, accused, of, a, crime, would, have, rice, powder, placed, in, their, mouths, in, ancient, middle, eastern, cultures, the, accused, were, made, to, lick, hot, metal, rods, briefly, it, is, thought, that, these, tests, had, some, validity, since, a, guilty, person, would, produce, less, saliva, and, thus, have, a, drier, mouth, the, accused, would, be, considered, guilty, if, rice, was, sticking, to, their, mouths, in, abundance, or, if, their, tongues, were, severely, burned, due, to, lack, of, shielding, from, saliva, initial, glance, forensic, intelligence, may, appear, as, a, nascent, facet, of, forensic, science, facilitated, by, advancements, in, information, technologies, such, as, computers, databases, and, data, flow, management, software, however, a, more, profound, examination, reveals, that, forensic, intelligence, represents, a, genuine, and, emerging, inclination, among, forensic, practitioners, to, actively, participate, in, investigative, and, policing, strategies, in, doing, so, it, elucidates, existing, practices, within, scientific, literature, advocating, for, a, paradigm, shift, from, the, prevailing, conception, of, forensic, science, as, a, conglomerate, of, disciplines, merely, aiding, the, criminal, justice, system, instead, it, urges, a, perspective, that, views, forensic, science, as, a, discipline, studying, the, informative, potential, of, traces, remnants, of, criminal, activity, embracing, this, transformative, shift, poses, a, significant, challenge, for, education, necessitating, a, shift, in, learners, mindset, to, accept, concepts, and, methodologies, in, forensic, intelligence, recent, calls, advocating, for, the, integration, of, forensic, scientists, into, the, criminal, justice, system, as, well, as, policing, and, intelligence, missions, underscore, the, necessity, for, the, establishment, of, educational, and, training, initiatives, in, the, field, of, forensic, intelligence, this, article, contends, that, a, discernible, gap, exists, between, the, perceived, and, actual, comprehension, of, forensic, intelligence, among, law, enforcement, and, forensic, science, managers, positing, that, this, asymmetry, can, be, rectified, only, through, educational, interventions, the, primary, challenge, in, forensic, intelligence, education, and, training, is, identified, as, the, formulation, of, programs, aimed, at, heightening, awareness, particularly, among, managers, to, mitigate, the, risk, of, making, suboptimal, decisions, in, information, processing, the, paper, highlights, two, recent, european, courses, as, exemplars, of, educational, endeavors, elucidating, lessons, learned, and, proposing, future, directions, the, overarching, conclusion, is, that, the, heightened, focus, on, forensic, intelligence, has, the, potential, to, rejuvenate, a, proactive, approach, to, forensic, science, enhance, quantifiable, efficiency, and, foster, greater, involvement, in, investigative, and, managerial, decision, making, a, novel, educational, challenge, is, articulated, for, forensic, science, university, programs, worldwide, a, shift, in, emphasis, from, a, fragmented, criminal, trace, analysis, to, a, more, comprehensive, security, problem, solving, approach, in, 16th, century, europe, medical, practitioners, in, army, and, university, settings, began, to, gather, information, on, the, cause, and, manner, of, death, ambroise, par, a, french, army, surgeon, systematically, studied, the, effects, of, violent, death, on, internal, organs, two, italian, surgeons, fortunato, fidelis, and, paolo, zacchia, laid, the, foundation, of, modern, pathology, by, studying, changes, that, occurred, in, the, structure, of, the, body, as, the, result, of, disease, in, the, late, 18th, century, writings, on, these, topics, began, to, appear, these, included, a, treatise, on, forensic, medicine, and, public, health, by, the, french, physician, francois, immanuele, fod, r, and, the, complete, system, of, police, medicine, by, the, german, medical, expert, johann, peter, frank, as, the, rational, values, of, the, enlightenment, era, increasingly, permeated, society, in, the, 18th, century, criminal, investigation, became, a, more, evidence, based, rational, procedure, the, use, of, torture, to, force, confessions, was, curtailed, and, belief, in, witchcraft, and, other, powers, of, the, occult, largely, ceased, to, influence, the, court, s, decisions, two, examples, of, english, forensic, science, in, individual, legal, proceedings, demonstrate, the, increasing, use, of, logic, and, procedure, in, criminal, investigations, at, the, time, in, 1784, in, lancaster, john, toms, was, tried, and, convicted, for, murdering, edward, culshaw, with, a, pistol, when, the, dead, body, of, culshaw, was, examined, a, pistol, wad, crushed, paper, used, to, secure, powder, and, balls, in, the, muzzle, found, in, his, head, wound, matched, perfectly, with, a, torn, newspaper, found, in, toms, s, pocket, leading, to, the, conviction, in, warwick, 1816, a, farm, laborer, was, tried, and, convicted, of, the, murder, of, a, young, maidservant, she, had, been, drowned, in, a, shallow, pool, and, bore, the, marks, of, violent, assault, the, police, found, footprints, and, an, impression, from, corduroy, cloth, with, a, sewn, patch, in, the, damp, earth, near, the, pool, there, were, also, scattered, grains, of, wheat, and, chaff, the, breeches, of, a, farm, labourer, who, had, been, threshing, wheat, nearby, were, examined, and, corresponded, exactly, to, the, impression, in, the, earth, near, the, pool, an, article, appearing, in, scientific, american, in, 1885, describes, the, use, of, microscopy, to, distinguish, between, the, blood, of, two, persons, in, a, criminal, case, in, chicago, chromatography, is, a, common, technique, used, in, the, field, of, forensic, science, chromatography, is, a, method, of, separating, the, components, of, a, mixture, from, a, mobile, phase, chromatography, is, an, essential, tool, used, in, forensic, science, helping, analysts, identify, and, compare, trace, amounts, of, samples, including, ignitable, liquids, drugs, and, biological, samples, many, laboratories, utilize, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gc, ms, to, examine, these, kinds, of, samples, this, analysis, provides, rapid, and, reliant, data, to, identify, samples, in, question, a, method, for, detecting, arsenious, oxide, simple, arsenic, in, corpses, was, devised, in, 1773, by, the, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, his, work, was, expanded, upon, in, 1806, by, german, chemist, valentin, ross, who, learned, to, detect, the, poison, in, the, walls, of, a, victim, s, stomach, james, marsh, was, the, first, to, apply, this, new, science, to, the, art, of, forensics, he, was, called, by, the, prosecution, in, a, murder, trial, to, give, evidence, as, a, chemist, in, 1832, the, defendant, john, bodle, was, accused, of, poisoning, his, grandfather, with, arsenic, laced, coffee, marsh, performed, the, standard, test, by, mixing, a, suspected, sample, with, hydrogen, sulfide, and, hydrochloric, acid, while, he, was, able, to, detect, arsenic, as, yellow, arsenic, trisulfide, when, it, was, shown, to, the, jury, it, had, deteriorated, allowing, the, suspect, to, be, acquitted, due, to, reasonable, doubt, annoyed, by, that, marsh, developed, a, much, better, test, he, combined, a, sample, containing, arsenic, with, sulfuric, acid, and, arsenic, free, zinc, resulting, in, arsine, gas, the, gas, was, ignited, and, it, decomposed, to, pure, metallic, arsenic, which, when, passed, to, a, cold, surface, would, appear, as, a, silvery, black, deposit, so, sensitive, was, the, test, known, formally, as, the, marsh, test, that, it, could, detect, as, little, as, one, fiftieth, of, a, milligram, of, arsenic, he, first, described, this, test, in, the, edinburgh, philosophical, journal, in, 1836, ballistics, is, the, science, of, the, motion, of, projectiles, in, flight, in, forensic, science, analysts, examine, the, patterns, left, on, bullets, and, cartridge, casings, after, being, ejected, from, a, weapon, when, fired, a, bullet, is, left, with, indentations, and, markings, that, are, unique, to, the, barrel, and, firing, pin, of, the, firearm, that, ejected, the, bullet, this, examination, can, help, scientists, identify, possible, makes, and, models, of, weapons, connected, to, a, crime, henry, goddard, at, scotland, yard, pioneered, the, use, of, bullet, comparison, in, 1835, he, noticed, a, flaw, in, the, bullet, that, killed, the, victim, and, was, able, to, trace, this, back, to, the, mold, that, was, used, in, the, manufacturing, process, the, french, police, officer, alphonse, bertillon, was, the, first, to, apply, the, anthropological, technique, of, anthropometry, to, law, enforcement, thereby, creating, an, identification, system, based, on, physical, measurements, before, that, time, criminals, could, be, identified, only, by, name, or, photograph, dissatisfied, with, the, ad, hoc, methods, used, to, identify, captured, criminals, in, france, in, the, 1870s, he, began, his, work, on, developing, a, reliable, system, of, anthropometrics, for, human, classification, bertillon, created, many, other, forensics, techniques, including, forensic, document, examination, the, use, of, galvanoplastic, compounds, to, preserve, footprints, ballistics, and, the, dynamometer, used, to, determine, the, degree, of, force, used, in, breaking, and, entering, although, his, central, methods, were, soon, to, be, supplanted, by, fingerprinting, his, other, contributions, like, the, mug, shot, and, the, systematization, of, crime, scene, photography, remain, in, place, to, this, day, sir, william, herschel, was, one, of, the, first, to, advocate, the, use, of, fingerprinting, in, the, identification, of, criminal, suspects, while, working, for, the, indian, civil, service, he, began, to, use, thumbprints, on, documents, as, a, security, measure, to, prevent, the, then, rampant, repudiation, of, signatures, in, 1858, in, 1877, at, hooghly, near, kolkata, herschel, instituted, the, use, of, fingerprints, on, contracts, and, deeds, and, he, registered, government, pensioners, fingerprints, to, prevent, the, collection, of, money, by, relatives, after, a, pensioner, s, death, in, 1880, henry, faulds, a, scottish, surgeon, in, a, tokyo, hospital, published, his, first, paper, on, the, subject, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, discussing, the, usefulness, of, fingerprints, for, identification, and, proposing, a, method, to, record, them, with, printing, ink, he, established, their, first, classification, and, was, also, the, first, to, identify, fingerprints, left, on, a, vial, returning, to, the, uk, in, 1886, he, offered, the, concept, to, the, metropolitan, police, in, london, but, it, was, dismissed, at, that, time, faulds, wrote, to, charles, darwin, with, a, description, of, his, method, but, too, old, and, ill, to, work, on, it, darwin, gave, the, information, to, his, cousin, francis, galton, who, was, interested, in, anthropology, having, been, thus, inspired, to, study, fingerprints, for, ten, years, galton, published, a, detailed, statistical, model, of, fingerprint, analysis, and, identification, and, encouraged, its, use, in, forensic, science, in, his, book, finger, prints, he, had, calculated, that, the, chance, of, a, false, positive, two, different, individuals, having, the, same, fingerprints, was, about, 1, in, 64, billion, juan, vucetich, an, argentine, chief, police, officer, created, the, first, method, of, recording, the, fingerprints, of, individuals, on, file, in, 1892, after, studying, galton, s, pattern, types, vucetich, set, up, the, world, s, first, fingerprint, bureau, in, that, same, year, francisca, rojas, of, necochea, was, found, in, a, house, with, neck, injuries, whilst, her, two, sons, were, found, dead, with, their, throats, cut, rojas, accused, a, neighbour, but, despite, brutal, interrogation, this, neighbour, would, not, confess, to, the, crimes, inspector, alvarez, a, colleague, of, vucetich, went, to, the, scene, and, found, a, bloody, thumb, mark, on, a, door, when, it, was, compared, with, rojas, prints, it, was, found, to, be, identical, with, her, right, thumb, she, then, confessed, to, the, murder, of, her, sons, a, fingerprint, bureau, was, established, in, calcutta, kolkata, india, in, 1897, after, the, council, of, the, governor, general, approved, a, committee, report, that, fingerprints, should, be, used, for, the, classification, of, criminal, records, working, in, the, calcutta, anthropometric, bureau, before, it, became, the, fingerprint, bureau, were, azizul, haque, and, hem, chandra, bose, haque, and, bose, were, indian, fingerprint, experts, who, have, been, credited, with, the, primary, development, of, a, fingerprint, classification, system, eventually, named, after, their, supervisor, sir, edward, richard, henry, the, henry, classification, system, co, devised, by, haque, and, bose, was, accepted, in, england, and, wales, when, the, first, united, kingdom, fingerprint, bureau, was, founded, in, scotland, yard, the, metropolitan, police, headquarters, london, in, 1901, sir, edward, richard, henry, subsequently, achieved, improvements, in, dactyloscopy, in, the, united, states, henry, p, deforrest, used, fingerprinting, in, the, new, york, civil, service, in, 1902, and, by, december, 1905, new, york, city, police, department, deputy, commissioner, joseph, a, faurot, an, expert, in, the, bertillon, system, and, a, fingerprint, advocate, at, police, headquarters, introduced, the, fingerprinting, of, criminals, to, the, united, states, the, uhlenhuth, test, or, the, antigen, antibody, precipitin, test, for, species, was, invented, by, paul, uhlenhuth, in, 1901, and, could, distinguish, human, blood, from, animal, blood, based, on, the, discovery, that, the, blood, of, different, species, had, one, or, more, characteristic, proteins, the, test, represented, a, major, breakthrough, and, came, to, have, tremendous, importance, in, forensic, science, the, test, was, further, refined, for, forensic, use, by, the, swiss, chemist, maurice, m, ller, in, the, year, 1960s, forensic, dna, analysis, was, first, used, in, 1984, it, was, developed, by, sir, alec, jeffreys, who, realized, that, variation, in, the, genetic, sequence, could, be, used, to, identify, individuals, and, to, tell, individuals, apart, from, one, another, the, first, application, of, dna, profiles, was, used, by, jeffreys, in, a, double, murder, mystery, in, the, small, english, town, of, narborough, leicestershire, in, 1985, a, 15, year, old, school, girl, by, the, name, of, lynda, mann, was, raped, and, murdered, in, carlton, hayes, psychiatric, hospital, the, police, did, not, find, a, suspect, but, were, able, to, obtain, a, semen, sample, in, 1986, dawn, ashworth, 15, years, old, was, also, raped, and, strangled, in, the, nearby, village, of, enderby, forensic, evidence, showed, that, both, killers, had, the, same, blood, type, richard, buckland, became, the, suspect, because, he, worked, at, carlton, hayes, psychiatric, hospital, had, been, spotted, near, dawn, ashworth, s, murder, scene, and, knew, unreleased, details, about, the, body, he, later, confessed, to, dawn, s, murder, but, not, lynda, s, jefferys, was, brought, into, the, case, to, analyze, the, semen, samples, he, concluded, that, there, was, no, match, between, the, samples, and, buckland, who, became, the, first, person, to, be, exonerated, using, dna, jefferys, confirmed, that, the, dna, profiles, were, identical, for, the, two, murder, semen, samples, to, find, the, perpetrator, dna, samples, from, the, entire, male, population, more, than, 4, 000, aged, from, 17, to, 34, of, the, town, were, collected, they, all, were, compared, to, semen, samples, from, the, crime, a, friend, of, colin, pitchfork, was, heard, saying, that, he, had, given, his, sample, to, the, police, claiming, to, be, colin, colin, pitchfork, was, arrested, in, 1987, and, it, was, found, that, his, dna, profile, matched, the, semen, samples, from, the, murder, because, of, this, case, dna, databases, were, developed, there, is, the, national, fbi, and, international, databases, as, well, as, the, european, countries, enfsi, european, network, of, forensic, science, institutes, these, searchable, databases, are, used, to, match, crime, scene, dna, profiles, to, those, already, in, a, database, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, science, of, forensics, had, become, largely, established, in, the, sphere, of, criminal, investigation, scientific, and, surgical, investigation, was, widely, employed, by, the, metropolitan, police, during, their, pursuit, of, the, mysterious, jack, the, ripper, who, had, killed, a, number, of, women, in, the, 1880s, this, case, is, a, watershed, in, the, application, of, forensic, science, large, teams, of, policemen, conducted, house, to, house, inquiries, throughout, whitechapel, forensic, material, was, collected, and, examined, suspects, were, identified, traced, and, either, examined, more, closely, or, eliminated, from, the, inquiry, police, work, follows, the, same, pattern, today, over, 2000, people, were, interviewed, upwards, of, 300, people, were, investigated, and, 80, people, were, detained, the, investigation, was, initially, conducted, by, the, criminal, investigation, department, cid, headed, by, detective, inspector, edmund, reid, later, detective, inspectors, frederick, abberline, henry, moore, and, walter, andrews, were, sent, from, central, office, at, scotland, yard, to, assist, initially, butchers, surgeons, and, physicians, were, suspected, because, of, the, manner, of, the, mutilations, the, alibis, of, local, butchers, and, slaughterers, were, investigated, with, the, result, that, they, were, eliminated, from, the, inquiry, some, contemporary, figures, thought, the, pattern, of, the, murders, indicated, that, the, culprit, was, a, butcher, or, cattle, drover, on, one, of, the, cattle, boats, that, plied, between, london, and, mainland, europe, whitechapel, was, close, to, the, london, docks, and, usually, such, boats, docked, on, thursday, or, friday, and, departed, on, saturday, or, sunday, the, cattle, boats, were, examined, but, the, dates, of, the, murders, did, not, coincide, with, a, single, boat, s, movements, and, the, transfer, of, a, crewman, between, boats, was, also, ruled, out, at, the, end, of, october, robert, anderson, asked, police, surgeon, thomas, bond, to, give, his, opinion, on, the, extent, of, the, murderer, s, surgical, skill, and, knowledge, the, opinion, offered, by, bond, on, the, character, of, the, whitechapel, murderer, is, the, earliest, surviving, offender, profile, bond, s, assessment, was, based, on, his, own, examination, of, the, most, extensively, mutilated, victim, and, the, post, mortem, notes, from, the, four, previous, canonical, murders, in, his, opinion, the, killer, must, have, been, a, man, of, solitary, habits, subject, to, periodical, attacks, of, homicidal, and, erotic, mania, with, the, character, of, the, mutilations, possibly, indicating, satyriasis, bond, also, stated, that, the, homicidal, impulse, may, have, developed, from, a, revengeful, or, brooding, condition, of, the, mind, or, that, religious, mania, may, have, been, the, original, disease, but, i, do, not, think, either, hypothesis, is, likely, handbook, for, coroners, police, officials, military, policemen, was, written, by, the, austrian, criminal, jurist, hans, gross, in, 1893, and, is, generally, acknowledged, as, the, birth, of, the, field, of, criminalistics, the, work, combined, in, one, system, fields, of, knowledge, that, had, not, been, previously, integrated, such, as, psychology, and, physical, science, and, which, could, be, successfully, used, against, crime, gross, adapted, some, fields, to, the, needs, of, criminal, investigation, such, as, crime, scene, photography, he, went, on, to, found, the, institute, of, criminalistics, in, 1912, as, part, of, the, university, of, graz, law, school, this, institute, was, followed, by, many, similar, institutes, all, over, the, world, in, 1909, archibald, reiss, founded, the, institut, de, police, scientifique, of, the, university, of, lausanne, unil, the, first, school, of, forensic, science, in, the, world, dr, edmond, locard, became, known, as, the, sherlock, holmes, of, france, he, formulated, the, basic, principle, of, forensic, science, every, contact, leaves, a, trace, which, became, known, as, locard, s, exchange, principle, in, 1910, he, founded, what, may, have, been, the, first, criminal, laboratory, in, the, world, after, persuading, the, police, department, of, lyon, france, to, give, him, two, attic, rooms, and, two, assistants, symbolic, of, the, newfound, prestige, of, forensics, and, the, use, of, reasoning, in, detective, work, was, the, popularity, of, the, fictional, character, sherlock, holmes, written, by, arthur, conan, doyle, in, the, late, 19th, century, he, remains, a, great, inspiration, for, forensic, science, especially, for, the, way, his, acute, study, of, a, crime, scene, yielded, small, clues, as, to, the, precise, sequence, of, events, he, made, great, use, of, trace, evidence, such, as, shoe, and, tire, impressions, as, well, as, fingerprints, ballistics, and, handwriting, analysis, now, known, as, questioned, document, examination, such, evidence, is, used, to, test, theories, conceived, by, the, police, for, example, or, by, the, investigator, himself, all, of, the, techniques, advocated, by, holmes, later, became, reality, but, were, generally, in, their, infancy, at, the, time, conan, doyle, was, writing, in, many, of, his, reported, cases, holmes, frequently, complains, of, the, way, the, crime, scene, has, been, contaminated, by, others, especially, by, the, police, emphasising, the, critical, importance, of, maintaining, its, integrity, a, now, well, known, feature, of, crime, scene, examination, he, used, analytical, chemistry, for, blood, residue, analysis, as, well, as, toxicology, examination, and, determination, for, poisons, he, used, ballistics, by, measuring, bullet, calibres, and, matching, them, with, a, suspected, murder, weapon, hans, gross, applied, scientific, methods, to, crime, scenes, and, was, responsible, for, the, birth, of, criminalistics, edmond, locard, expanded, on, gross, work, with, locard, s, exchange, principle, which, stated, whenever, two, objects, come, into, contact, with, one, another, materials, are, exchanged, between, them, this, means, that, every, contact, by, a, criminal, leaves, a, trace, alexander, lacassagne, who, taught, locard, produced, autopsy, standards, on, actual, forensic, cases, alphonse, bertillon, was, a, french, criminologist, and, founder, of, anthropometry, scientific, study, of, measurements, and, proportions, of, the, human, body, he, used, anthropometry, for, identification, stating, that, since, each, individual, is, unique, by, measuring, aspects, of, physical, difference, there, could, be, a, personal, identification, system, he, created, the, bertillon, system, around, 1879, a, way, of, identifying, criminals, and, citizens, by, measuring, 20, parts, of, the, body, in, 1884, over, 240, repeat, offenders, were, caught, using, the, bertillon, system, but, the, system, was, largely, superseded, by, fingerprinting, frances, glessner, lee, known, as, the, mother, of, forensic, science, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, forensic, science, in, the, us, she, lobbied, to, have, coroners, replaced, by, medical, professionals, endowed, the, harvard, associates, in, police, science, and, conducted, many, seminars, to, educate, homicide, investigators, she, also, created, the, nutshell, studies, of, unexplained, death, intricate, crime, scene, dioramas, used, to, train, investigators, which, are, still, in, use, today, later, in, the, 20th, century, several, british, pathologists, mikey, rochman, francis, camps, sydney, smith, and, keith, simpson, pioneered, new, forensic, science, methods, alec, jeffreys, pioneered, the, use, of, dna, profiling, in, forensic, science, in, 1984, he, realized, the, scope, of, dna, fingerprinting, which, uses, variations, in, the, genetic, code, to, identify, individuals, the, method, has, since, become, important, in, forensic, science, to, assist, police, detective, work, and, it, has, also, proved, useful, in, resolving, paternity, and, immigration, disputes, dna, fingerprinting, was, first, used, as, a, police, forensic, test, to, identify, the, rapist, and, killer, of, two, teenagers, lynda, mann, and, dawn, ashworth, who, were, both, murdered, in, narborough, leicestershire, in, 1983, and, 1986, respectively, colin, pitchfork, was, identified, and, convicted, of, murder, after, samples, taken, from, him, matched, semen, samples, taken, from, the, two, dead, girls, forensic, science, has, been, fostered, by, a, number, of, national, and, international, forensic, science, learned, bodies, including, the, american, academy, of, forensic, sciences, founded, 1948, publishers, of, the, journal, of, forensic, sciences, the, canadian, society, of, forensic, science, founded, 1953, publishers, of, the, journal, of, the, canadian, society, of, forensic, science, the, chartered, society, of, forensic, sciences, founded, 1959, then, known, as, the, forensic, science, society, publisher, of, science, justice, the, british, academy, of, forensic, sciences, founded, 1960, publishers, of, medicine, science, and, the, law, the, australian, academy, of, forensic, sciences, founded, 1967, publishers, of, the, australian, journal, of, forensic, sciences, and, the, european, network, of, forensic, science, institutes, founded, 1995, in, the, past, decade, documenting, forensics, scenes, has, become, more, efficient, forensic, scientists, have, started, using, laser, scanners, drones, and, photogrammetry, to, obtain, 3d, point, clouds, of, accidents, or, crime, scenes, reconstruction, of, an, accident, scene, on, a, highway, using, drones, involves, data, acquisition, time, of, only, 10, 20, minutes, and, can, be, performed, without, shutting, down, traffic, the, results, are, not, just, accurate, in, centimeters, for, measurement, to, be, presented, in, court, but, also, easy, to, digitally, preserve, in, the, long, term, now, in, the, 21st, century, much, of, forensic, science, s, future, is, up, for, discussion, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, has, several, forensic, science, related, programs, csafe, a, nist, center, of, excellence, in, forensic, science, the, national, commission, on, forensic, science, now, concluded, and, administration, of, the, organization, of, scientific, area, committees, for, forensic, science, osac, one, of, the, more, recent, additions, by, nist, is, a, document, called, nistir, 7941, titled, forensic, science, laboratories, handbook, for, facility, planning, design, construction, and, relocation, the, handbook, provides, a, clear, blueprint, for, approaching, forensic, science, the, details, even, include, what, type, of, staff, should, be, hired, for, certain, positions, some, forensic, techniques, believed, to, be, scientifically, sound, at, the, time, they, were, used, have, turned, out, later, to, have, much, less, scientific, merit, or, none, some, such, techniques, include, litigation, science, describes, analysis, or, data, developed, or, produced, expressly, for, use, in, a, trial, versus, those, produced, in, the, course, of, independent, research, this, distinction, was, made, by, the, u, s, 9th, circuit, court, of, appeals, when, evaluating, the, admissibility, of, experts, this, uses, demonstrative, evidence, which, is, evidence, created, in, preparation, of, trial, by, attorneys, or, paralegals, in, the, united, states, there, are, over, 17, 200, forensic, science, technicians, as, of, 2019, real, life, crime, scene, investigators, and, forensic, scientists, warn, that, popular, television, shows, do, not, give, a, realistic, picture, of, the, work, often, wildly, distorting, its, nature, and, exaggerating, the, ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence, and, comfort, level, of, their, jobs, which, they, describe, as, far, more, mundane, tedious, and, boring, some, claim, these, modern, tv, shows, have, changed, individuals, expectations, of, forensic, science, sometimes, unrealistically, an, influence, termed, the, csi, effect, further, research, has, suggested, that, public, misperceptions, about, criminal, forensics, can, create, in, the, mind, of, a, juror, unrealistic, expectations, of, forensic, evidence, which, they, expect, to, see, before, convicting, implicitly, biasing, the, juror, towards, the, defendant, citing, the, csi, effect, at, least, one, researcher, has, suggested, screening, jurors, for, their, level, of, influence, from, such, tv, programs, questions, about, certain, areas, of, forensic, science, such, as, fingerprint, evidence, and, the, assumptions, behind, these, disciplines, have, been, brought, to, light, in, some, publications, including, the, new, york, post, the, article, stated, that, no, one, has, proved, even, the, basic, assumption, that, everyone, s, fingerprint, is, unique, the, article, also, stated, that, now, such, assumptions, are, being, questioned, and, with, it, may, come, a, radical, change, in, how, forensic, science, is, used, by, police, departments, and, prosecutors, law, professor, jessica, gabel, said, on, nova, that, forensic, science, lacks, the, rigors, the, standards, the, quality, controls, and, procedures, that, we, find, usually, in, science, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, has, reviewed, the, scientific, foundations, of, bite, mark, analysis, used, in, forensic, science, bite, mark, analysis, is, a, forensic, science, technique, that, analyzes, the, marks, on, the, victim, s, skin, compared, to, the, suspects, teeth, nist, reviewed, the, findings, of, the, national, academies, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, 2009, study, the, national, academics, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, conducted, research, to, address, the, issues, of, reliability, accuracy, and, reliability, of, bitemark, analysis, where, they, concluded, that, there, is, a, lack, of, sufficient, scientific, foundation, to, support, the, data, yet, the, technique, is, still, legal, to, use, in, court, as, evidence, nist, funded, a, 2019, meeting, that, consisted, of, dentists, lawyers, researchers, and, others, to, address, the, gaps, in, this, field, in, the, us, on, 25, june, 2009, the, supreme, court, issued, a, 5, to, 4, decision, in, melendez, diaz, v, massachusetts, stating, that, crime, laboratory, reports, may, not, be, used, against, criminal, defendants, at, trial, unless, the, analysts, responsible, for, creating, them, give, testimony, and, subject, themselves, to, cross, examination, the, supreme, court, cited, the, national, academies, of, sciences, report, strengthening, forensic, science, in, the, united, states, in, their, decision, writing, for, the, majority, justice, antonin, scalia, referred, to, the, national, research, council, report, in, his, assertion, that, forensic, evidence, is, not, uniquely, immune, from, the, risk, of, manipulation, in, the, us, another, area, of, forensic, science, that, has, come, under, question, in, recent, years, is, the, lack, of, laws, requiring, the, accreditation, of, forensic, labs, some, states, require, accreditation, but, some, states, do, not, because, of, this, many, labs, have, been, caught, performing, very, poor, work, resulting, in, false, convictions, or, acquittals, for, example, it, was, discovered, after, an, audit, of, the, houston, police, department, in, 2002, that, the, lab, had, fabricated, evidence, which, led, george, rodriguez, being, convicted, of, raping, a, fourteen, year, old, girl, the, former, director, of, the, lab, when, asked, said, that, the, total, number, of, cases, that, could, have, been, contaminated, by, improper, work, could, be, in, the, range, of, 5, 000, to, 10, 000, the, innocence, project, database, of, dna, exonerations, shows, that, many, wrongful, convictions, contained, forensic, science, errors, according, to, the, innocence, project, and, the, us, department, of, justice, forensic, science, has, contributed, to, about, 39, percent, to, 46, percent, of, wrongful, convictions, as, indicated, by, the, national, academy, of, sciences, report, strengthening, forensic, sciences, in, the, united, states, part, of, the, problem, is, that, many, traditional, forensic, sciences, have, never, been, empirically, validated, and, part, of, the, problem, is, that, all, examiners, are, subject, to, forensic, confirmation, biases, and, should, be, shielded, from, contextual, information, not, relevant, to, the, judgment, they, make, many, studies, have, discovered, a, difference, in, rape, related, injuries, reporting, based, on, race, with, white, victims, reporting, a, higher, frequency, of, injuries, than, black, victims, however, since, current, forensic, examination, techniques, may, not, be, sensitive, to, all, injuries, across, a, range, of, skin, colors, more, research, needs, to, be, conducted, to, understand, if, this, trend, is, due, to, skin, confounding, healthcare, providers, when, examining, injuries, or, if, darker, skin, extends, a, protective, element, in, clinical, practice, for, patients, with, darker, skin, one, study, recommends, that, attention, must, be, paid, to, the, thighs, labia, majora, posterior, fourchette, and, fossa, navicularis, so, that, no, rape, related, injuries, are, missed, upon, close, examination, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, icrc, uses, forensic, science, for, humanitarian, purposes, to, clarify, the, fate, of, missing, persons, after, armed, conflict, disasters, or, migration, and, is, one, of, the, services, related, to, restoring, family, links, and, missing, persons, knowing, what, has, happened, to, a, missing, relative, can, often, make, it, easier, to, proceed, with, the, grieving, process, and, move, on, with, life, for, families, of, missing, persons, forensic, science, is, used, by, various, other, organizations, to, clarify, the, fate, and, whereabouts, of, persons, who, have, gone, missing, examples, include, the, ngo, argentine, forensic, anthropology, team, working, to, clarify, the, fate, of, people, who, disappeared, during, the, period, of, the, 1976, 1983, military, dictatorship, the, international, commission, on, missing, persons, icmp, used, forensic, science, to, find, missing, persons, for, example, after, the, conflicts, in, the, balkans, recognising, the, role, of, forensic, science, for, humanitarian, purposes, as, well, as, the, importance, of, forensic, investigations, in, fulfilling, the, state, s, responsibilities, to, investigate, human, rights, violations, a, group, of, experts, in, the, late, 1980s, devised, a, un, manual, on, the, prevention, and, investigation, of, extra, legal, arbitrary, and, summary, executions, which, became, known, as, the, minnesota, protocol, this, document, was, revised, and, re, published, by, the, office, of, the, high,
