aryan, ia, language, evolved, from, sanskrit, the, traditional, practice, is, to, differentiate, the, ia, languages, on, the, basis, of, three, historical, stages, another, view, postulates, successive, family, tree, splits, in, which, gujarati, is, assumed, to, have, separated, from, other, ia, languages, in, four, stages, the, principal, changes, from, the, middle, indo, aryan, stage, are, the, following, gujarati, is, then, customarily, divided, into, the, following, three, historical, stages, old, gujar, t, 1200, ce, 1500, ce, which, descended, from, prakrit, and, the, ancestor, of, modern, gujarati, and, rajasthani, was, spoken, by, the, gurjars, who, were, residing, and, ruling, in, gujarat, punjab, rajputana, and, central, india, the, language, was, used, as, literary,

three, genders, as, gujarati, does, today, and, by, around, the, time, of, 1300, ce, a, fairly, standardized, form, of, this, language, emerged, while, generally, known, as, old, gujarati, some, scholars, prefer, the, name, old, western, rajasthani, based, upon, the, argument, that, gujarati, and, rajasthani, were, not, yet, distinct, factoring, into, this, preference, was, the, belief, that, modern, rajasthani, sporadically, expressed, a, neuter, gender, based, on, the, incorrect, conclusion, that, the, that, came, to, be, pronounced, in, some, areas, for, masculine, after, a, nasal, consonant, was, analogous, to, gujarati, s, neuter, a, formal, grammar, prakrita, vyakarana, of, the, precursor, to, this, language, gurjar, apabhra, a, was, written, by, jain, monk, and, eminent,

the, phonemes, and, the, auxiliary, stem, ch, and, the, possessive, marker, n, major, phonological, changes, characteristic, of, the, transition, between, old, and, middle, gujarati, are, these, developments, would, have, grammatical, consequences, for, example, old, gujarati, s, instrumental, locative, singular, in, i, was, leveled, and, eliminated, having, become, the, same, as, old, gujarati, s, nominative, accusative, singular, in, a, major, phonological, change, was, the, deletion, of, final, such, that, the, modern, language, has, consonant, final, words, grammatically, a,

dialect, however, gujarati, has, undergone, contemporary, reclassification, with, respect, to, the, widespread, regional, differences, in, vocabulary, and, phrasing, notwithstanding, the, number, of, poorly, attested, dialects, and, regional, variations, in, naming, kharwa, kakari, and, tarimuki, ghisadi, are, also, often, cited, as, additional, varieties, of, gujarati, kutchi, is, often, referred, to, as, a, dialect, of, gujarati, but, most, linguists, consider, it, closer, to, sindhi, in, addition, the, memoni, is, related, to, gujarati, albeit, distantly, furthermore, words, used, by, the, native, languages, of, areas, where, the, gujarati, people, have, become, a, diaspora, community, such, as, east, africa, swahili, have, become, loanwords, in, local, dialects, of, gujarati,

differentiated, by, the, loss, of, the, characteristic, horizontal, line, running, above, the, letters, and, by, a, small, number, of, modifications, in, the, remaining, characters, these, are, the, three, general, categories, of, words, in, modern, indo, aryan, tadbhav, tatsam, and, loanwords, tadbhava, of, the, nature, of, that, gujarati, is, a, modern, indo, aryan, language, descended, from, sanskrit, old, indo, aryan, and, this, category, pertains, exactly, to, that, words, of, sanskritic, origin, that, have, demonstratively, undergone, change, over, the, ages, ending, up, characteristic, of, modern, indo, aryan, languages, specifically, as, well, as, in, general, thus, the, that, in, of, the, nature, of, that, refers, to, sanskrit, they, tend, to, be, non, technical, everyday, crucial, words, part, of, the, spoken, vernacular, below, is, a, table, of, a, few, gujarati, tadbhav, words, and, their, old, indo, aryan, sources, tatsama, same, as, that, while, sanskrit, eventually, stopped, being, spoken, vernacularly, in, that, it, changed, into, middle, indo, aryan, it, was, nonetheless, standardised, and, retained, as, a, literary, and, liturgical, language, for, long, after, this, category, consists, of, these, borrowed, words, of, more, or, less, pure, sanskrit, character, they, serve, to, enrich, gujarati, and, modern, indo, aryan, in, its, formal, technical, and, religious, vocabulary, they, are, recognisable, by, their, sanskrit, inflections, and, markings, they, are, thus, often, treated, as, a, separate, grammatical, category, unto, themselves, many, old, tatsam, words, have, changed, their, meanings, or, have, had, their, meanings, adopted, for, modern, times, pras, ra, means, spreading, but, now, it, is, used, for, broadcasting, in, addition, to, this, are, neologisms, often, being, calques, an, example, is, telephone, which, is, greek, for, far, talk, translated, as, durbh, most, people, though, just, use, phon, and, thus, neo, sanskrit, has, varying, degrees, of, acceptance, so, while, having, unique, tadbhav, sets, modern, ia, languages, have, a, common, higher, tatsam, pool, also, tatsam, s, and, their, derived, tadbhav, s, can, also, co, exist, in, a, language, sometimes, of, no, consequence, and, at, other, times, with, differences, in, meaning, what, remains, are, words, of, foreign, origin, vide, as, well, as, words, of, local, origin, that, cannot, be, pegged, as, belonging, to, any, of, the, three, prior, categories, de, aj, the, former, consists, mainly, of, persian, arabic, and, english, with, trace, elements, of, portuguese, and, turkish, while, the, phenomenon, of, english, loanwords, is, relatively, new, perso, arabic, has, a, longer, history, behind, it, both, english, and, perso, arabic, influences, are, quite, nationwide, phenomena, in, a, way, paralleling, tatsam, as, a, common, vocabulary, set, or, bank, what, s, more, is, how, beyond, a, transposition, into, general, indo, aryan, the, perso, arabic, set, has, also, been, assimilated, in, a, manner, characteristic, and, relevant, to, the, specific, indo, aryan, language, it, is, being, used, in, bringing, to, mind, tadbhav, india, was, ruled, for, many, centuries, by, persian, speaking, muslims, amongst, the, most, notable, being, the, delhi, sultanate, and, the, mughal, dynasty, as, a, consequence, indian, languages, were, changed, greatly, with, the, large, scale, entry, of, persian, and, its, many, arabic, loans, into, the, gujarati, lexicon, one, fundamental, adoption, was, persian, s, conjunction, that, ke, also, while, tatsam, or, sanskrit, is, etymologically, continuous, to, gujarati, it, is, essentially, of, a, differing, grammar, or, language, and, that, in, comparison, while, perso, arabic, is, etymologically, foreign, it, has, been, in, certain, instances, and, to, varying, degrees, grammatically, indigenised, owing, to, centuries, of, situation, and, the, end, of, persian, education, and, power, 1, perso, arabic, loans, are, quite, unlikely, to, be, thought, of, or, known, as, loans, and, 2, more, importantly, these, loans, have, often, been,

the, last, three, are, definite, part, and, parcel, below, is, a, table, displaying, a, number, of, these, loans, currently, some, of, the, etymologies, are, being, referenced, to, an, urdu, dictionary, so, that, gujarati, s, singular, masculine, o, corresponds, to, urdu, neuter, groups, into, as, urdu, has, no, neuter, gender, and, urdu, s, persian, z, is, not, upheld, in, gujarati, and, corresponds, to, j, or, jh, in, contrast, to, modern, persian, the, pronunciation, of, these, loans, into, gujarati, and, other, indo, aryan, languages, as, well, as, that, of, indian, recited, persian, seems, to, be, in, line, with, persian, spoken, in, afghanistan, and, central, asia, perhaps, 500, years, ago, lastly, persian, being, part, of, the, indo, iranian, language, family, as, sanskrit, and, gujarati, are, met, up, in, some, instances, with, its, cognates, zoroastrian, persian, refugees, known, as, parsis, also, speak, an, accordingly, persianized, form, of, gujarati, with, the, end, of, perso, arabic, inflow, english, became, the, current, foreign, source, of, new, vocabulary, english, had, and, continues, to, have, a, considerable, influence, over, indian, languages, loanwords, include, new, innovations, and, concepts, first, introduced, directly, through, british, colonial, rule, and, then, streaming, in, on, the, basis, of, continued, anglophone, dominance, in, the, republic, of, india, besides, the, category, of, new, ideas, is, the, category, of, english, words, that, already, have, gujarati, counterparts, which, end, up, replaced, or, existed, alongside, with, the, major, driving, force, behind, this, latter, category, has, to, be, the, continuing, role, of, english, in, modern, india, as, a, language, of, education, prestige, and, mobility, in, this, way, indian, speech, can, be, sprinkled, with, english, words, and, expressions, even, switches, to, whole, sentences, see, hinglish, code, switching, in, matters, of, sound, english, alveolar, consonants, map, as, retroflexes, rather, than, dentals, two, new, characters, were, created, in, gujarati, to, represent, english, s, and, s, levels, of, gujarati, ization, in, sound, vary, some, words, do, not, go, far, beyond, this, basic, transpositional, rule, and, sound, much, like, their, english, source, while, others, differ, in, ways, one, of, those, ways, being, the, carrying, of, dentals, see, indian, english, as, english, loanwords, are, a, relatively, new, phenomenon, they, adhere, to, english, grammar, as, tatsam, words, adhere, to, sanskrit, that, is, not, to, say, that, the, most, basic, changes, have, been, underway, many, english, words, are, pluralised, with, gujarati, o, over, english, s, also, with, gujarati, having, three, genders, genderless, english, words, must, take, one, though, often, inexplicable, gender, assignment, may, follow, the, same, basis, as, it, is, expressed, in, gujarati, vowel, type, and, the, nature, of, word, meaning, the, smaller, foothold, the, portuguese, had, in, wider, india, had, linguistic, effects, gujarati, took, up, a, number, of, words, while, elsewhere, the, influence, was, great, enough, to, the, extent, that, creole, languages, came, to, be, see, portuguese, india, portuguese, based, creole, languages, in, india, and, sri, lanka, comparatively, the, impact, of, portuguese, has, been, greater, on, coastal,
