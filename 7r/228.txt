ethnography, is, a, branch, of, anthropology, and, the, systematic, study, of, individual, cultures, ethnography, explores, cultural, phenomena, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, subject, of, the, study, ethnography, is, also, a, type, of, social, research, that, involves, examining, the, behavior, of, the, participants, in, a, given, social, situation, and, understanding, the, group, members, own, interpretation, of, such, behavior, as, a, form, of, inquiry, ethnography, relies, heavily, on, participant, observation, on, the, researcher, participating, in, the, setting, or, with, the, people, being, studied, at, least, in, some, marginal, role, and, seeking, to, document, in, detail, patterns, of, social, interaction, and, the, perspectives, of, participants, and, to, understand, these, in, their, local, contexts, it, had, its, origin, in, social, and, cultural, anthropology, in, the, early, twentieth, century, but, spread, to, other, social, science, disciplines, notably, sociology, during, the, course, of, that, century, ethnographers, mainly, use, qualitative, methods, though, they, may, also, employ, quantitative, data, the, typical, ethnography, is, a, holistic, study, and, so, includes, a, brief, history, and, an, analysis, of, the, terrain, the, climate, and, the, habitat, a, wide, range, of, groups, and, organisations, have, been, studied, by, this, method, including, traditional, communities, youth, gangs, religious, cults, and, organisations, of, various, kinds, while, traditionally, ethnography, has, relied, on, the, physical, presence, of, the, researcher, in, a, setting, there, is, research, using, the, label, that, has, relied, on, interviews, or, documents, sometimes, to, investigate, events, in, the, past, such, as, the, nasa, challenger, disaster, there, is, also, a, considerable, amount, of, virtual, or, online, ethnography, sometimes, labelled, netnography, or, cyber, ethnography, the, term, ethnography, is, from, greek, thnos, folk, people, nation, and, gr, ph, i, write, and, encompasses, the, ways, in, which, ancient, authors, described, and, analyzed, foreign, cultures, anthony, kaldellis, loosely, suggests, the, odyssey, as, a, starting, point, for, ancient, ethnography, while, noting, that, herodotus, histories, is, the, usual, starting, point, while, edith, hall, has, argued, that, homeric, poetry, lacks, the, coherence, and, vigour, of, ethnological, science, from, herodotus, forward, ethnography, was, a, mainstay, of, ancient, historiography, tacitus, has, ethnographies, in, the, agricola, histories, and, germania, tacitus, germania, stands, as, the, sole, surviving, full, scale, monograph, by, a, classical, author, on, an, alien, people, ethnography, formed, a, relatively, coherent, subgenre, in, byzantine, literature, while, ethnography, ethnographic, writing, was, widely, practiced, in, antiquity, ethnography, as, a, science, cf, ethnology, did, not, exist, in, the, ancient, world, there, is, no, ancient, term, or, concept, applicable, to, ethnography, and, those, writers, probably, did, not, consider, the, study, of, other, cultures, as, a, distinct, mode, of, inquiry, from, history, gerhard, friedrich, m, ller, developed, the, concept, of, ethnography, as, a, separate, discipline, whilst, participating, in, the, second, kamchatka, expedition, 1733, 43, as, a, professor, of, history, and, geography, whilst, involved, in, the, expedition, he, differentiated, v, lker, beschreibung, as, a, distinct, area, of, study, this, became, known, as, ethnography, following, the, introduction, of, the, greek, neologism, ethnographia, by, johann, friedrich, sch, pperlin, and, the, german, variant, by, a, f, thilo, in, 1767, august, ludwig, von, schl, zer, and, christoph, wilhelm, jacob, gatterer, of, the, university, of, g, ttingen, introduced, the, term, into, the, academic, discourse, in, an, attempt, to, reform, the, contemporary, understanding, of, world, history, according, to, dewan, 2018, the, researcher, is, not, looking, for, generalizing, the, findings, rather, they, are, considering, it, in, reference, to, the, context, of, the, situation, in, this, regard, the, best, way, to, integrate, ethnography, in, a, quantitative, research, would, be, to, use, it, to, discover, and, uncover, relationships, and, then, use, the, resultant, data, to, test, and, explain, the, empirical, assumptions, in, ethnography, the, researcher, gathers, what, is, available, what, is, normal, what, it, is, that, people, do, what, they, say, and, how, they, work, ethnography, can, also, be, used, in, other, methodological, frameworks, for, instance, an, action, research, program, of, study, where, one, of, the, goals, is, to, change, and, improve, the, situation, ethnographic, research, is, a, fundamental, methodology, in, cultural, ecology, development, studies, and, feminist, geography, in, addition, it, has, gained, importance, in, social, political, cultural, and, nature, society, geography, ethnography, is, an, effective, methodology, in, qualitative, geographic, research, that, focuses, on, people, s, perceptions, and, experiences, and, their, traditionally, place, based, immersion, within, a, social, group, according, to, john, brewer, a, leading, social, scientist, data, collection, methods, are, meant, to, capture, the, social, meanings, and, ordinary, activities, of, people, informants, in, naturally, occurring, settings, that, are, commonly, referred, to, as, the, field, the, goal, is, to, collect, data, in, such, a, way, that, the, researcher, imposes, a, minimal, amount, of, personal, bias, in, the, data, multiple, methods, of, data, collection, may, be, employed, to, facilitate, a, relationship, that, allows, for, a, more, personal, and, in, depth, portrait, of, the, informants, and, their, community, these, can, include, participant, observation, field, notes, interviews, and, surveys, as, well, as, various, visual, methods, interviews, are, often, taped, and, later, transcribed, allowing, the, interview, to, proceed, unimpaired, of, note, taking, but, with, all, information, available, later, for, full, analysis, secondary, research, and, document, analysis, are, also, used, to, provide, insight, into, the, research, topic, in, the, past, kinship, charts, were, commonly, used, to, discover, logical, patterns, and, social, structure, in, non, western, societies, in, the, 21st, century, anthropology, focuses, more, on, the, study, of, people, in, urban, settings, and, the, use, of, kinship, charts, is, seldom, employed, in, order, to, make, the, data, collection, and, interpretation, transparent, researchers, creating, ethnographies, often, attempt, to, be, reflexive, reflexivity, refers, to, the, researcher, s, aim, to, explore, the, ways, in, which, researcher, s, involvement, with, a, particular, study, influences, acts, upon, and, informs, such, research, marvasti, amir, gubrium, jaber, 2023, crafting, ethnographic, fieldwork, sites, selves, social, worlds, routledge, despite, these, attempts, of, reflexivity, no, researcher, can, be, totally, unbiased, this, factor, has, provided, a, basis, to, criticize, ethnography, traditionally, the, ethnographer, focuses, attention, on, a, community, selecting, knowledgeable, informants, who, know, the, activities, of, the, community, well, these, informants, are, typically, asked, to, identify, other, informants, who, represent, the, community, often, using, snowball, or, chain, sampling, this, process, is, often, effective, in, revealing, common, cultural, denominators, connected, to, the, topic, being, studied, ethnography, relies, greatly, on, up, close, personal, experience, participation, rather, than, just, observation, is, one, of, the, keys, to, this, process, ethnography, is, very, useful, in, social, research, an, inevitability, during, ethnographic, participation, is, that, the, researcher, experiences, at, least, some, resocialization, in, other, words, the, ethnographer, to, some, extent, becomes, what, they, are, studying, for, instance, an, ethnographer, may, become, skilled, at, a, work, activity, that, they, are, studying, they, may, become, members, of, a, particular, religious, group, they, are, interested, in, studying, or, they, may, even, inhabit, a, familial, role, in, a, community, they, are, staying, with, robert, m, emerson, rachel, fretz, and, linda, shaw, summarize, this, idea, in, their, book, writing, ethnographic, field, notes, using, a, common, metaphor, the, fieldworker, cannot, and, should, not, attempt, to, be, a, fly, on, the, wall, ybema, et, al, 2010, examine, the, ontological, and, epistemological, presuppositions, underlying, ethnography, ethnographic, research, can, range, from, a, realist, perspective, in, which, behavior, is, observed, to, a, constructivist, perspective, where, understanding, is, socially, constructed, by, the, researcher, and, subjects, research, can, range, from, an, objectivist, account, of, fixed, observable, behaviors, to, an, interpretive, narrative, describing, the, interplay, of, individual, agency, and, social, structure, critical, theory, researchers, address, issues, of, power, within, the, researcher, researched, relationships, and, the, links, between, knowledge, and, power, another, form, of, data, collection, is, that, of, the, image, the, image, is, the, projection, that, an, individual, puts, on, an, object, or, abstract, idea, an, image, can, be, contained, within, the, physical, world, through, a, particular, individual, s, perspective, primarily, based, on, that, individual, s, past, experiences, one, example, of, an, image, is, how, an, individual, views, a, novel, after, completing, it, the, physical, entity, that, is, the, novel, contains, a, specific, image, in, the, perspective, of, the, interpreting, individual, and, can, only, be, expressed, by, the, individual, in, the, terms, of, i, can, tell, you, what, an, image, is, by, telling, you, what, it, feels, like, the, idea, of, an, image, relies, on, the, imagination, and, has, been, seen, to, be, utilized, by, children, in, a, very, spontaneous, and, natural, manner, effectively, the, idea, of, the, image, is, a, primary, tool, for, ethnographers, to, collect, data, the, image, presents, the, perspective, experiences, and, influences, of, an, individual, as, a, single, entity, and, in, consequence, the, individual, will, always, contain, this, image, in, the, group, under, study, the, ethnographic, method, is, used, across, a, range, of, different, disciplines, primarily, by, anthropologists, ethnologists, but, also, occasionally, by, sociologists, cultural, studies, occupational, therapy, economics, social, work, education, design, psychology, computer, science, human, factors, and, ergonomics, ethnomusicology, folkloristics, religious, studies, geography, history, linguistics, communication, studies, performance, studies, advertising, accounting, research, nursing, urban, planning, usability, political, science, social, movement, and, criminology, are, other, fields, which, have, made, use, of, ethnography, cultural, anthropology, and, social, anthropology, were, developed, around, ethnographic, research, and, their, canonical, texts, which, are, mostly, ethnographies, e, g, argonauts, of, the, western, pacific, 1922, by, bronis, aw, malinowski, ethnologische, excursion, in, johore, 1875, by,

1963, by, mary, douglas, cultural, and, social, anthropologists, today, place, a, high, value, on, doing, ethnographic, research, the, typical, ethnography, is, a, document, written, about, a, particular, people, almost, always, based, at, least, in, part, on, emic, views, of, where, the, culture, begins, and, ends, using, language, or, community, boundaries, to, bound, the, ethnography, is, common, ethnographies, are, also, sometimes, called, case, studies, ethnographers, study, and, interpret, culture, its, universalities, and, its, variations, through, the, ethnographic, study, based, on, fieldwork, an, ethnography, is, a, specific, kind, of, written, observational, science, which, provides, an, account, of, a, particular, culture, society, or, community, the, fieldwork, usually, involves, spending, a, year, or, more, in, another, society, living, with, the, local, people, and, learning, about, their, ways, of, life, ruth, fulton, benedict, uses, examples, of,

the, culture, isomorphism, that, would, be, considered, her, personalized, unique, approach, to, the, study, of, anthropology, using, ethnographic, techniques, a, typical, ethnography, attempts, to, be, holistic, and, typically, follows, an, outline, to, include, a, brief, history, of, the, culture, in, question, an, analysis, of, the, physical, geography, or, terrain, inhabited, by, the, people, under, study, including, climate, and, often, including, what, biological, anthropologists, call, habitat, folk, notions, of, botany, and, zoology, are, presented, as, ethnobotany, and, ethnozoology, alongside, references, from, the, formal, sciences, material, culture, technology, and, means, of, subsistence, are, usually, treated, next, as, they, are, typically, bound, up, in, physical, geography, and, include, descriptions, of, infrastructure, kinship, and, social, structure, including, age, grading, peer, groups, gender, voluntary, associations, clans, moieties, and, so, forth, if, they, exist, are, typically, included, languages, spoken, dialects, and, the, history, of, language, change, are, another, group, of, standard, topics, practices, of, child, rearing, acculturation, and, emic, views, on, personality, and, values, usually, follow, after, sections, on, social, structure, rites, rituals, and, other, evidence, of, religion, have, long, been, an, interest, and, are, sometimes, central, to, ethnographies, especially, when, conducted, in, public, where, visiting, anthropologists, can, see, them, as, ethnography, developed, anthropologists, grew, more, interested, in, less, tangible, aspects, of, culture, such, as, values, worldview, and, what, clifford, geertz, termed, the, ethos, of, the, culture, in, his, fieldwork, geertz, used, elements, of, a, phenomenological, approach, tracing, not, just, the, doings, of, people, but, the, cultural, elements, themselves, for, example, if, within, a, group, of, people, winking, was, a, communicative, gesture, he, sought, to, first, determine, what, kinds, of, things, a, wink, might, mean, it, might, mean, several, things, then, he, sought, to, determine, in, what, contexts, winks, were, used, and, whether, as, one, moved, about, a, region, winks, remained, meaningful, in, the, same, way, in, this, way, cultural, boundaries, of, communication, could, be, explored, as, opposed, to, using, linguistic, boundaries, or, notions, about, the, residence, geertz, while, still, following, something, of, a, traditional, ethnographic, outline, moved, outside, that, outline, to, talk, about, webs, instead, of, outlines, of, culture, within, cultural, anthropology, there, are, several, subgenres, of, ethnography, beginning, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, anthropologists, began, writing, bio, confessional, ethnographies, that, intentionally, exposed, the, nature, of, ethnographic, research, famous, examples, include, tristes, tropiques, 1955, by, l, vi, strauss, the, high, valley, by, kenneth, read, and, the, savage, and, the, innocent, by, david, maybury, lewis, as, well, as, the, mildly, fictionalized, return, to, laughter, by, elenore, smith, bowen, laura, bohannan, later, reflexive, ethnographies, refined, the, technique, to, translate, cultural, differences, by, representing, their, effects, on, the, ethnographer, famous, examples, include, deep, play, notes, on, a, balinese, cockfight, by, clifford, geertz, reflections, on, fieldwork, in, morocco, by, paul, rabinow, the, headman, and, i, by, jean, paul, dumont, and, tuhami, by, vincent, crapanzano, in, the, 1980s, the, rhetoric, of, ethnography, was, subjected, to, intense, scrutiny, within, the, discipline, under, the, general, influence, of, literary, theory, and, post, colonial, post, structuralist, thought, experimental, ethnographies, that, reveal, the, ferment, of, the, discipline, include, shamanism, colonialism, and, the, wild, man, by, michael, taussig, debating, muslims, by, michael, f, j, fischer, and, mehdi, abedi, a, space, on, the, side, of, the, road, by, kathleen, stewart, and, advocacy, after, bhopal, by, kim, fortun, this, critical, turn, in, sociocultural, anthropology, during, the, mid, 1980s, can, be, traced, to, the, influence, of, the, now, classic, and, often, contested, text, writing, culture, the, poetics, and, politics, of, ethnography, 1986, edited, by, james, clifford, and, george, marcus, writing, culture, helped, bring, changes, to, both, anthropology, and, ethnography, often, described, in, terms, of, being, postmodern, reflexive, literary, deconstructive, or, poststructural, in, nature, in, that, the, text, helped, to, highlight, the, various, epistemic, and, political, predicaments, that, many, practitioners, saw, as, plaguing, ethnographic, representations, and, practices, where, geertz, s, and, turner, s, interpretive, anthropology, recognized, subjects, as, creative, actors, who, constructed, their, sociocultural, worlds, out, of, symbols, postmodernists, attempted, to, draw, attention, to, the, privileged, status, of, the, ethnographers, themselves, that, is, the, ethnographer, cannot, escape, the, personal, viewpoint, in, creating, an, ethnographic, account, thus, making, any, claims, of, objective, neutrality, highly, problematic, if, not, altogether, impossible, in, regards, to, this, last, point, writing, culture, became, a, focal, point, for, looking, at, how, ethnographers, could, describe, different, cultures, and, societies, without, denying, the, subjectivity, of, those, individuals, and, groups, being, studied, while, simultaneously, doing, so, without, laying, claim, to, absolute, knowledge, and, objective, authority, along, with, the, development, of, experimental, forms, such, as, dialogic, anthropology, narrative, ethnography, and, literary, ethnography, writing, culture, helped, to, encourage, the, development, of, collaborative, ethnography, this, exploration, of, the, relationship, between, writer, audience, and, subject, has, become, a, central, tenet, of, contemporary, anthropological, and, ethnographic, practice, in, certain, instances, active, collaboration, between, the, researcher, s, and, subject, s, has, helped, blend, the, practice, of, collaboration, in, ethnographic, fieldwork, with, the, process, of, creating, the, ethnographic, product, resulting, from, the, research, 1800s, martineau, tocqueville, marx, spencer, le, bon, ward, pareto, t, nnies, veblen, simmel, durkheim, addams, mead, weber, du, bois, mannheim, elias, sociology, is, another, field, which, prominently, features, ethnographies, urban, sociology, atlanta, university, now, clark, atlanta, university, and, the, chicago, school, in, particular, are, associated, with, ethnographic, research, with, some, well, known, early, examples, being, the, philadelphia, negro, 1899, by, w, e, b, du, bois, street, corner, society, by, william, foote, whyte, and, black, metropolis, by, st, clair, drake, and, horace, r, cayton, jr, well, known, is, jaber, f, gubrium, s, pioneering, ethnography, on, the, experiences, of, a, nursing, home, living, and, dying, at, murray, manor, major, influences, on, this, development, were, anthropologist, lloyd, warner, on, the, chicago, sociology, faculty, and, to, robert, park, s, experience, as, a, journalist, symbolic, interactionism, developed, from, the, same, tradition, and, yielded, such, sociological, ethnographies, as, shared, fantasy, by, gary, alan, fine, which, documents, the, early, history, of, fantasy, role, playing, games, other, important, ethnographies, in, sociology, include, pierre, bourdieu, s, work, in, algeria, and, france, jaber, f, gubrium, s, series, of, organizational, ethnographies, focused, on, the, everyday, practices, of, illness, care, and, recovery, are, notable, they, include, living, and, dying, at, murray, manor, which, describes, the, social, worlds, of, a, nursing, home, describing, care, image, and, practice, in, rehabilitation, which, documents, the, social, organization, of, patient, subjectivity, in, a, physical, rehabilitation, hospital, caretakers, treating, emotionally, disturbed, children, which, features, the, social, construction, of, behavioral, disorders, in, children, and, oldtimers, and, alzheimer, s, the, descriptive, organization, of, senility, which, describes, how, the, alzheimer, s, disease, movement, constructed, a, new, subjectivity, of, senile, dementia, and, how, that, is, organized, in, a, geriatric, hospital, another, approach, to, ethnography, in, sociology, comes, in, the, form, of, institutional, ethnography, developed, by, dorothy, e, smith, for, studying, the, social, relations, which, structure, people, s, everyday, lives, other, notable, ethnographies, include, paul, willis, s, learning, to, labour, on, working, class, youth, the, work, of, elijah, anderson, mitchell, duneier, and, lo, c, wacquant, on, black, america, and, lai, olurode, s, glimpses, of, madrasa, from, africa, but, even, though, many, sub, fields, and, theoretical, perspectives, within, sociology, use, ethnographic, methods, ethnography, is, not, the, sine, qua, non, of, the, discipline, as, it, is, in, cultural, anthropology, beginning, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, ethnographic, research, methods, began, to, be, widely, used, by, communication, scholars, as, the, purpose, of, ethnography, is, to, describe, and, interpret, the, shared, and, learned, patterns, of, values, behaviors, beliefs, and, language, of, a, culture, sharing, group, harris, 1968, also, agar, 1980, note, that, ethnography, is, both, a, process, and, an, outcome, of, the, research, studies, such, as, gerry, philipsen, s, analysis, of, cultural, communication, strategies, in, a, blue, collar, working, class, neighborhood, on, the, south, side, of, chicago, speaking, like, a, man, in, teamsterville, paved, the, way, for, the, expansion, of, ethnographic, research, in, the, study, of, communication, scholars, of, communication, studies, use, ethnographic, research, methods, to, analyze, communicative, behaviors, and, phenomena, this, is, often, characterized, in, the, writing, as, attempts, to, understand, taken, for, granted, routines, by, which, working, definitions, are, socially, produced, ethnography, as, a, method, is, a, storied, careful, and, systematic, examination, of, the, reality, generating, mechanisms, of, everyday, life, coulon, 1995, ethnographic, work, in, communication, studies, seeks, to, explain, how, ordinary, methods, practices, performances, construct, the, ordinary, actions, used, by, ordinary, people, in, the, accomplishments, of, their, identities, this, often, gives, the, perception, of, trying, to, answer, the, why, and, how, come, questions, of, human, communication, often, this, type, of, research, results, in, a, case, study, or, field, study, such, as, an, analysis, of, speech, patterns, at, a, protest, rally, or, the, way, firemen, communicate, during, down, time, at, a, fire, station, like, anthropology, scholars, communication, scholars, often, immerse, themselves, and, participate, in, and, or, directly, observe, the, particular, social, group, being, studied, the, american, anthropologist, george, spindler, was, a, pioneer, in, applying, the, ethnographic, methodology, to, the, classroom, anthropologists, such, as, daniel, miller, and, mary, douglas, have, used, ethnographic, data, to, answer, academic, questions, about, consumers, and, consumption, in, this, sense, tony, salvador, genevieve, bell, and, ken, anderson, describe, design, ethnography, as, being, a, way, of, understanding, the, particulars, of, daily, life, in, such, a, way, as, to, increase, the, success, probability, of, a, new, product, or, service, or, more, appropriately, to, reduce, the, probability, of, failure, specifically, due, to, a, lack, of, understanding, of, the, basic, behaviors, and, frameworks, of, consumers, sociologist, sam, ladner, argues, in, her, book, that, understanding, consumers, and, their, desires, requires, a, shift, in, standpoint, one, that, only, ethnography, provides, the, results, are, products, and, services, that, respond, to, consumers, unmet, needs, businesses, too, have, found, ethnographers, helpful, for, understanding, how, people, use, products, and, services, by, assessing, user, experience, in, a, natural, setting, ethnology, yields, insights, into, the, practical, applications, of, a, product, or, service, it, is, one, of, the, best, ways, to, identify, areas, of, friction, and, improve, overall, user, experience, companies, make, increasing, use, of, ethnographic, methods, to, understand, consumers, and, consumption, or, for, new, product, development, such, as, video, ethnography, the, ethnographic, praxis, in, industry, epic, conference, is, evidence, of, this, ethnographers, systematic, and, holistic, approach, to, real, life, experience, is, valued, by, product, developers, who, use, the, method, to, understand, unstated, desires, or, cultural, practices, that, surround, products, where, focus, groups, fail, to, inform, marketers, about, what, people, really, do, ethnography, links, what, people, say, to, what, they, do, avoiding, the, pitfalls, that, come, from, relying, only, on, self, reported, focus, group, data, the, ethnographic, methodology, is, not, usually, evaluated, in, terms, of, philosophical, standpoint, such, as, positivism, and, emotionalism, ethnographic, studies, need, to, be, evaluated, in, some, manner, no, consensus, has, been, developed, on, evaluation, standards, but, richardson, 2000, p, 254, provides, five, criteria, that, ethnographers, might, find, helpful, jaber, f, gubrium, and, james, a, holstein, s, 1997, monograph, the, new, language, of, qualitative, method, discusses, forms, of, ethnography, in, terms, of, their, methods, talk, gary, alan, fine, argues, that, the, nature, of, ethnographic, inquiry, demands, that, researchers, deviate, from, formal, and, idealistic, rules, or, ethics, that, have, come, to, be, widely, accepted, in, qualitative, and, quantitative, approaches, in, research, many, of, these, ethical, assumptions, are, rooted, in, positivist, and, post, positivist, epistemologies, that, have, adapted, over, time, but, are, apparent, and, must, be, accounted, for, in, all, research, paradigms, these, ethical, dilemmas, are, evident, throughout, the, entire, process, of, conducting, ethnographies, including, the, design, implementation, and, reporting, of, an, ethnographic, study, essentially, fine, maintains, that, researchers, are, typically, not, as, ethical, as, they, claim, or, assume, to, be, and, that, each, job, includes, ways, of, doing, things, that, would, be, inappropriate, for, others, to, know, also, see, jaber, f, gubrium, concept, of, site, specificity, discussed, his, book, co, edited, with, amir, marvasti, titled, crafting, ethnographic, fieldwork, routledge, 2023, fine, is, not, necessarily, casting, blame, at, ethnographic, researchers, but, tries, to, show, that, researchers, often, make, idealized, ethical, claims, and, standards, which, are, inherently, based, on, partial, truths, and, self, deceptions, fine, also, acknowledges, that, many, of, these, partial, truths, and, self, deceptions, are, unavoidable, he, maintains, that, illusions, are, essential, to, maintain, an, occupational, reputation, and, avoid, potentially, more, caustic, consequences, he, claims, ethnographers, cannot, help, but, lie, but, in, lying, we, reveal, truths, that, escape, those, who, are, not, so, bold, based, on, these, assertions, fine, establishes, three, conceptual, clusters, in, which, ethnographic, ethical, dilemmas, can, be, situated, classic, virtues, technical, skills, and, ethnographic, self, much, debate, surrounding, the, issue, of, ethics, arose, following, revelations, about, how, the, ethnographer, napoleon, chagnon, conducted, his, ethnographic, fieldwork, with, the, yanomani, people, of, south, america, while, there, is, no, international, standard, on, ethnographic, ethics, many, western, anthropologists, look, to, the, american, anthropological, association, for, guidance, when, conducting, ethnographic, work, in, 2009, the, association, adopted, a, code, of, ethics, stating, anthropologists, have, moral, obligations, as, members, of, other, groups, such, as, the, family, religion, and, community, as, well, as, the, profession, the, code, of, ethics, notes, that, anthropologists, are, part, of, a, wider, scholarly, and, political, network, as, well, as, human, and, natural, environment, which, needs, to, be, reported, on, respectfully, the, code, of, ethics, recognizes, that, sometimes, very, close, and, personal, relationship, can, sometimes, develop, from, doing, ethnographic, work, the, association, acknowledges, that, the, code, is, limited, in, scope, ethnographic, work, can, sometimes, be, multidisciplinary, and, anthropologists, need, to, be, familiar, with, ethics, and, perspectives, of, other, disciplines, as, well, the, eight, page, code, of, ethics, outlines, ethical, considerations, for, those, conducting, research, teaching, application, and, dissemination, of, results, which, are, briefly, outlined, below, the, following, are, commonly, misconceived, conceptions, of, ethnographers, according, to, norman, k, denzin, ethnographers, should, consider, the, following, seven, principles, when, observing, recording, and, sampling, data, autoethnography, is, a, form, of, ethnographic, research, in, which, a, researcher, connects, personal, experiences, to, wider, cultural, political, and, social, meanings, and, understandings, according, to, adams, et, al, autoethnography, bochner, and, ellis, have, also, defined, autoethnography, as, an, autobiographical, genre, of, writing, and, research, that, displays, multiple, layers, of, consciousness, connecting, the, personal, to, the, cultural, 65, they, further, indicate, that, autoethnography, is, typically, written, in, first, person, and, can, appear, in, a, variety, of, forms, such, as, short, stories, poetry, fiction, novels, photographic, essays, personal, essays, journals, fragmented, and, layered, writing, and, social, science, prose, 65, the, genealogical, method, investigates, links, of, kinship, determined, by, marriage, and, descent, the, method, owes, its, origin, from, the, book, of, british, ethnographer, w, h, r, rivers, titled, kinship, and, social, organisation, in, 1911, genealogy, or, kinship, commonly, plays, a, crucial, role, in, the, structure, of, non, industrial, societies, determining, both, social, relations, and, group, relationship, to, the, past, marriage, for, example, is, frequently, pivotal, in, determining, military, alliances, between, villages, clans, or, ethnic, groups, in, the, field, of, epistemology, the, term, is, used, to, characterize, the, philosophical, method, employed, by, such, writers, as, friedrich, nietzsche, and, michel, foucault, digital, ethnography, is, also, seen, as, virtual, ethnography, this, type, of, ethnography, is, not, so, typical, as, ethnography, recorded, by, pen, and, pencil, digital, ethnography, allows, for, a, lot, more, opportunities, to, look, at, different, cultures, and, societies, traditional, ethnography, may, use, videos, or, images, but, digital, ethnography, goes, more, in, depth, for, example, digital, ethnographers, would, use, social, media, platforms, such, as, twitter, or, blogs, so, that, people, s, interactions, and, behaviors, can, be, studied, modern, developments, in, computing, power, and, ai, have, enabled, higher, efficiencies, in, ethnographic, data, collection, via, multimedia, and, computational, analysis, using, machine, learning, to, corroborate, many, data, sources, together, to, produce, a, refined, output, for, various, purposes, a, modern, example, of, this, technology, in, application, is, the, use, of, captured, audio, in, smart, devices, transcribed, to, issue, targeted, adverts, often, reconciled, vs, other, metadata, or, product, development, data, for, designers, digital, ethnography, comes, with, its, own, set, of, ethical, questions, and, the, association, of, internet, researchers, ethical, guidelines, are, frequently, used, gabriele, de, seta, s, paper, three, lies, of, digital, ethnography, explores, some, of, the, methodological, questions, more, central, to, a, specifically, ethnographical, approach, to, internet, studies, drawing, upon, fine, s, classic, text, multispecies, ethnography, in, particular, focuses, on, both, nonhuman, and, human, participants, within, a, group, or, culture, as, opposed, to, just, human, participants, in, traditional, ethnography, a, multispecies, ethnography, in, comparison, to, other, forms, of, ethnography, studies, species, that, are, connected, to, people, and, our, social, lives, species, affect, and, are, affected, by, culture, economics, and, politics, the, study, s, roots, go, back, to, general, anthropology, of, animals, one, of, the, earliest, well, known, studies, was, lewis, henry, morgan, s, the, american, beaver, and, his, works, 1868, his, study, closely, observed, a, group, of, beavers, in, northern, michigan, morgan, s, main, objective, was, to, highlight, that, the, daily, individual, tasks, that, the, beavers, performed, were, complex, communicative, acts, that, had, been, passed, down, for, generations, in, the, early, 2000s, multi, species, ethnography, took, on, a, huge, increase, in, popularity, the, annual, meetings, of, the, american, anthropological, association, began, to, host, the, multispecies, salon, a, collection, of, discussions, showcases, and, other, events, for, anthropologists, the, event, provided, a, space, for, anthropologists, and, artists, to, come, together, and, showcase, vast, knowledge, of, different, organisms, and, their, intertwined, systems, multispecies, ethnography, highlights, a, lot, of, the, negative, effects, of, these, shared, environments, and, systems, not, only, does, multispecies, ethnography, observe, the, physical, relationships, between, organisms, it, also, takes, note, of, the, emotional, and, psychological, relationships, built, between, species, most, ethnographies, take, place, in, specific, places, where, the, observer, can, observe, specific, instances, that, relate, to, the, topic, involved, relational, ethnography, articulates, studying, fields, rather, than, places, or, processes, rather, than, processed, people, meaning, that, relational, ethnography, doesn, t, take, an, object, nor, a, bounded, group, that, is, defined, by, its, members, shared, social, features, nor, a, specific, location, that, is, delimited, by, the, boundaries, of, a, particular, area, but, rather, the, processes, involving, configurations, of, relations, among, different, agents, or, institutions
