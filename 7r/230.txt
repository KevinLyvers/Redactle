aboriginal, australians, are, the, various, indigenous, peoples, of, the, australian, mainland, and, many, of, its, islands, excluding, the, ethnically, distinct, people, of, the, torres, strait, islands, humans, first, migrated, to, australia, at, least, 65, 000, years, ago, and, over, time, formed, as, many, as, 500, language, based, groups, in, the, past, aboriginal, people, lived, over, large, sections, of, the, continental, shelf, they, were, isolated, on, many, of, the, smaller, offshore, islands, and, tasmania, when, the, land, was, inundated, at, the, start, of, the, holocene, inter, glacial, period, about, 11, 700, years, ago, despite, this, aboriginal, people, maintained, extensive, networks, within, the, continent, and, certain, groups, maintained, relationships, with, torres, strait, islanders, and, the, makassar, people, of, modern, day, indonesia, aboriginal, australians, have, a, wide, variety, of, cultural, practices, and, beliefs, that, make, up, the, oldest, continuous, cultures, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, european, colonisation, of, australia, the, aboriginal, people, consisted, of, complex, cultural, societies, with, more, than, 250, languages, and, varying, degrees, of, technology, and, settlements, languages, or, dialects, and, language, associated, groups, of, people, are, connected, with, stretches, of, territory, known, as, country, with, which, they, have, a, profound, spiritual, connection, over, the, millennia, aboriginal, people, developed, complex, trade, networks, inter, cultural, relationships, law, and, religions, contemporary, aboriginal, beliefs, are, a, complex, mixture, varying, by, region, and, individual, across, the, continent, they, are, shaped, by, traditional, beliefs, the, disruption, of, colonisation, religions, brought, to, the, continent, by, europeans, and, contemporary, issues, traditional, cultural, beliefs, are, passed, down, and, shared, through, dancing, stories, songlines, and, art, that, collectively, weave, an, ontology, of, modern, daily, life, and, ancient, creation, known, as, dreaming, studies, of, aboriginal, groups, genetic, makeup, are, ongoing, but, evidence, suggests, that, they, have, genetic, inheritance, from, ancient, asian, but, not, more, modern, peoples, they, share, some, similarities, with, papuans, but, have, been, isolated, from, southeast, asia, for, a, very, long, time, they, have, a, broadly, shared, complex, genetic, history, but, only, in, the, last, 200, years, were, they, defined, by, others, as, and, started, to, self, identify, as, a, single, group, aboriginal, identity, has, changed, over, time, and, place, with, family, lineage, self, identification, and, community, acceptance, all, of, varying, importance, in, the, 2021, census, indigenous, australians, comprised, 3, 8, of, australia, s, population, most, aboriginal, people, today, speak, english, and, live, in, cities, some, may, use, aboriginal, phrases, and, words, in, australian, aboriginal, english, which, also, has, a, tangible, influence, of, aboriginal, languages, in, the, phonology, and, grammatical, structure, many, but, not, all, also, speak, the, various, traditional, languages, of, their, clans, and, peoples, aboriginal, people, along, with, torres, strait, islander, people, have, a, number, of, severe, health, and, economic, deprivations, in, comparison, with, the, wider, australian, community, dna, studies, have, confirmed, that, aboriginal, australians, are, one, of, the, oldest, living, populations, in, the, world, certainly, the, oldest, outside, of, africa, their, ancestors, left, the, african, continent, 75, 000, years, ago, they, may, have, the, oldest, continuous, culture, on, earth, in, arnhem, land, in, the, northern, territory, oral, histories, comprising, complex, narratives, have, been, passed, down, by, yolngu, people, through, hundreds, of, generations, the, aboriginal, rock, art, dated, by, modern, techniques, shows, that, their, culture, has, continued, from, ancient, times, the, ancestors, of, present, day, aboriginal, australian, people, migrated, from, southeast, asia, by, sea, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, and, lived, over, large, sections, of, the, australian, continental, shelf, when, the, sea, levels, were, lower, at, that, time, australia, tasmania, and, new, guinea, were, part, of, the, same, landmass, known, as, sahul, as, sea, levels, rose, the, people, on, the, australian, mainland, and, nearby, islands, became, increasingly, isolated, some, on, tasmania, and, some, of, the, smaller, offshore, islands, when, the, land, was, inundated, at, the, start, of, the, holocene, the, inter, glacial, period, that, started, about, 11, 700, years, ago, scholars, of, this, ancient, history, believe, that, it, would, have, been, difficult, for, aboriginal, people, to, have, originated, purely, from, mainland, asia, not, enough, people, would, have, migrated, to, australia, and, surrounding, islands, to, fulfill, the, beginning, of, the, size, of, the, population, seen, in, the, 19th, century, scholars, believe, that, most, aboriginal, australians, originated, from, southeast, asia, if, this, is, the, case, aboriginal, australians, were, among, the, first, in, the, world, to, have, completed, sea, voyages, a, 2017, paper, in, nature, evaluated, artefacts, in, kakadu, its, authors, concluded, human, occupation, began, around, 65, 000, years, ago, a, 2021, study, by, researchers, at, the, australian, research, council, centre, of, excellence, for, australian, biodiversity, and, heritage, has, mapped, the, likely, migration, routes, of, the, peoples, as, they, moved, across, the, australian, continent, to, its, southern, reaches, and, what, is, now, tasmania, then, part, of, the, mainland, the, modelling, is, based, on, data, from, archaeologists, anthropologists, ecologists, geneticists, climatologists, geomorphologists, and, hydrologists, it, is, intended, to, compare, this, data, with, the, oral, histories, of, aboriginal, peoples, including, dreaming, stories, australian, rock, art, and, linguistic, features, of, the, many, aboriginal, languages, which, reveal, how, the, peoples, developed, separately, the, routes, dubbed, superhighways, by, the, authors, are, similar, to, current, highways, and, stock, routes, in, australia, lynette, russell, of, monash, university, believes, that, the, new, model, is, a, starting, point, for, collaboration, with, aboriginal, people, to, help, reveal, their, history, the, new, models, suggest, that, the, first, people, may, have, landed, in, the, kimberley, region, in, what, is, now, western, australia, about, 60, 000, years, ago, they, migrated, across, the, continent, within, 6, 000, years, a, 2018, study, using, archaeobotany, dated, evidence, of, continuous, human, habitation, at, karnatukul, serpent, s, glen, in, the, carnarvon, range, in, the, little, sandy, desert, in, wa, from, around, 50, 000, years, ago, genetic, studies, have, revealed, that, aboriginal, australians, largely, descended, from, an, eastern, eurasian, population, wave, during, the, initial, upper, paleolithic, they, are, most, closely, related, to, other, oceanians, such, as, melanesians, the, aboriginal, australians, also, show, affinity, to, other, australasian, populations, such, as, negritos, as, well, as, to, east, asian, peoples, phylogenetic, data, suggests, that, an, early, initial, eastern, lineage, ena, trifurcated, somewhere, in, south, asia, and, gave, rise, to, australasians, oceanians, ancient, ancestral, south, indian, aasi, andamanese, and, the, east, southeast, asian, lineage, including, ancestors, of, the, native, americans, papuans, may, have, received, approximately, 2, of, their, geneflow, from, an, earlier, group, xooa, as, well, next, to, additional, archaic, admixture, in, the, sahul, region, aboriginal, people, are, genetically, most, similar, to, the, indigenous, populations, of, papua, new, guinea, and, more, distantly, related, to, groups, from, east, indonesia, they, are, more, distinct, from, the, indigenous, populations, of, borneo, and, malaysia, sharing, drift, with, them, than, compared, to, the, groups, from, papua, new, guinea, and, indonesia, this, indicates, that, populations, in, australia, were, isolated, for, a, long, time, from, the, rest, of, southeast, asia, they, remained, untouched, by, migrations, and, population, expansions, into, that, area, which, can, be, explained, by, the, wallace, line, in, a, 2001, study, blood, samples, were, collected, from, some, warlpiri, people, in, the, northern, territory, to, study, their, genetic, makeup, which, is, not, representative, of, all, aboriginal, peoples, in, australia, the, study, concluded, that, the, warlpiri, are, descended, from, ancient, asians, whose, dna, is, still, somewhat, present, in, southeastern, asian, groups, although, greatly, diminished, the, warlpiri, dna, lacks, certain, information, found, in, modern, asian, genomes, and, carries, information, not, found, in, other, genomes, this, reinforces, the, idea, of, ancient, aboriginal, isolation, genetic, data, extracted, in, 2011, by, morten, rasmussen, et, al, who, took, a, dna, sample, from, an, early, 20th, century, lock, of, an, aboriginal, person, s, hair, found, that, the, aboriginal, ancestors, probably, migrated, through, south, asia, and, maritime, southeast, asia, into, australia, where, they, stayed, as, a, result, outside, of, africa, the, aboriginal, peoples, have, occupied, the, same, territory, continuously, longer, than, any, other, human, populations, these, findings, suggest, that, modern, aboriginal, australians, are, the, direct, descendants, of, the, eastern, wave, who, left, africa, up, to, 75, 000, years, ago, this, finding, is, compatible, with, earlier, archaeological, finds, of, human, remains, near, lake, mungo, that, date, to, approximately, 40, 000, years, ago, the, idea, of, the, oldest, continuous, culture, is, based, on, the, aboriginal, peoples, geographical, isolation, with, little, or, no, interaction, with, outside, cultures, before, some, contact, with, makassan, fishermen, and, dutch, explorers, up, to, 500, years, ago, the, rasmussen, study, also, found, evidence, that, aboriginal, peoples, carry, some, genes, associated, with, the, denisovans, a, species, of, human, related, to, but, distinct, from, neanderthals, of, asia, the, study, suggests, that, there, is, an, increase, in, allele, sharing, between, the, denisovan, and, aboriginal, australian, genomes, compared, to, other, eurasians, or, africans, examining, dna, from, a, finger, bone, excavated, in, siberia, researchers, concluded, that, the, denisovans, migrated, from, siberia, to, tropical, parts, of, asia, and, that, they, interbred, with, modern, humans, in, southeast, asia, 44, 000, years, bp, before, australia, separated, from, new, guinea, approximately, 11, 700, years, bp, they, contributed, dna, to, aboriginal, australians, and, to, present, day, new, guineans, and, an, indigenous, tribe, in, the, philippines, known, as, mamanwa, this, study, confirms, aboriginal, australians, as, one, of, the, oldest, living, populations, in, the, world, they, are, possibly, the, oldest, outside, africa, and, they, may, have, the, oldest, continuous, culture, on, the, planet, a, 2016, study, at, the, university, of, cambridge, suggests, that, it, was, about, 50, 000, years, ago, that, these, peoples, reached, sahul, the, supercontinent, consisting, of, present, day, australia, and, its, islands, and, new, guinea, the, sea, levels, rose, and, isolated, australia, about, 10, 000, years, ago, but, aboriginal, australians, and, papuans, diverged, from, each, other, genetically, earlier, about, 37, 000, years, bp, possibly, because, the, remaining, land, bridge, was, impassable, this, isolation, makes, the, aboriginal, people, the, world, s, oldest, culture, the, study, also, found, evidence, of, an, unknown, hominin, group, distantly, related, to, denisovans, with, whom, the, aboriginal, and, papuan, ancestors, must, have, interbred, leaving, a, trace, of, about, 4, in, most, aboriginal, australians, genome, there, is, however, increased, genetic, diversity, among, aboriginal, australians, based, on, geographical, distribution, carlhoff, et, al, 2021, analysed, a, holocene, hunter, gatherer, sample, leang, panninge, from, south, sulawesi, which, shares, high, amounts, of, genetic, drift, with, aboriginal, australians, and, papuans, this, suggests, that, a, population, split, from, the, common, ancestor, of, aboriginal, australians, and, papuans, the, sample, also, shows, genetic, affinity, with, east, asians, and, the, andamanese, people, of, south, asia, the, authors, note, that, this, hunter, gatherer, sample, can, be, modelled, with, 50, papuan, related, ancestry, and, either, with, 50, east, asian, or, andamanese, onge, ancestry, highlighting, the, deep, split, between, leang, panninge, and, aboriginal, papuans, mallick, et, al, 2016, and, mark, lipson, et, al, 2017, study, found, the, bifurcation, of, eastern, eurasians, and, western, eurasians, dates, to, least, 45, 000, years, ago, with, indigenous, australians, nested, inside, the, eastern, eurasian, clade, two, genetic, studies, by, larena, et, al, 2021, found, that, philippines, negrito, people, split, from, the, common, ancestor, of, aboriginal, australians, and, papuans, before, the, latter, two, diverged, from, each, other, but, after, their, common, ancestor, diverged, from, the, ancestor, of, east, asian, peoples, the, dingo, reached, australia, about, 4, 000, years, ago, near, that, time, there, were, changes, in, language, with, the, pama, nyungan, language, family, spreading, over, most, of, the, mainland, and, in, stone, tool, technology, smaller, tools, were, used, human, contact, has, thus, been, inferred, and, genetic, data, of, two, kinds, have, been, proposed, to, support, a, gene, flow, from, india, to, australia, firstly, signs, of, south, asian, components, in, aboriginal, australian, genomes, reported, on, the, basis, of, genome, wide, snp, data, and, secondly, the, existence, of, a, y, chromosome, male, lineage, designated, haplogroup, c, with, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, about, 5, 000, years, ago, the, first, type, of, evidence, comes, from, a, 2013, study, by, the, max, planck, institute, for, evolutionary, anthropology, using, large, scale, genotyping, data, from, a, pool, of, aboriginal, australians, new, guineans, island, southeast, asians, and, indians, it, found, that, the, new, guinea, and, mamanwa, philippines, area, groups, diverged, from, the, aboriginal, about, 36, 000, years, ago, there, is, supporting, evidence, that, these, populations, are, descended, from, migrants, taking, an, early, southern, route, out, of, africa, before, other, groups, in, the, area, also, the, indian, and, australian, populations, mixed, long, before, european, contact, with, this, gene, flow, occurring, during, the, holocene, c, 4, 200, years, ago, the, researchers, had, two, theories, for, this, either, some, indians, had, contact, with, people, in, indonesia, who, eventually, transferred, those, indian, genes, to, aboriginal, australians, or, a, group, of, indians, migrated, from, india, to, australia, and, intermingled, with, the, locals, directly, however, a, 2016, study, in, current, biology, by, anders, bergstr, m, et, al, excluded, the, y, chromosome, as, providing, evidence, for, recent, gene, flow, from, india, into, australia, the, study, authors, sequenced, 13, aboriginal, australian, y, chromosomes, using, recent, advances, in, gene, sequencing, technology, they, investigated, their, divergence, times, from, y, chromosomes, in, other, continents, including, comparing, the, haplogroup, c, chromosomes, they, found, a, divergence, time, of, about, 54, 100, years, between, the, sahul, c, chromosome, and, its, closest, relative, c5, as, well, as, about, 54, 300, years, between, haplogroups, k, m, and, their, closest, haplogroups, r, and, q, the, deep, divergence, time, of, 50, 000, plus, years, with, the, south, asian, chromosome, and, the, fact, that, the, aboriginal, australian, cs, share, a, more, recent, common, ancestor, with, papuan, cs, excludes, any, recent, genetic, contact, the, 2016, study, s, authors, concluded, that, although, this, does, not, disprove, the, presence, of, any, holocene, gene, flow, or, non, genetic, influences, from, south, asia, at, that, time, and, the, appearance, of, the, dingo, does, provide, strong, evidence, for, external, contacts, the, evidence, overall, is, consistent, with, a, complete, lack, of, gene, flow, and, points, to, indigenous, origins, for, the, technological, and, linguistic, changes, they, attributed, the, disparity, between, their, results, and, previous, findings, to, improvements, in, technology, none, of, the, other, studies, had, utilised, complete, y, chromosome, sequencing, which, has, the, highest, precision, for, example, use, of, a, ten, y, strs, method, has, been, shown, to, massively, underestimate, divergence, times, gene, flow, across, the, island, dotted, 150, kilometre, wide, 93, mi, torres, strait, is, both, geographically, plausible, and, demonstrated, by, the, data, although, at, this, point, it, could, not, be, determined, from, this, study, when, within, the, last, 10, 000, years, it, may, have, occurred, newer, analytical, techniques, have, the, potential, to, address, such, questions, bergstrom, s, 2018, doctoral, thesis, looking, at, the, population, of, sahul, suggests, that, other, than, relatively, recent, admixture, the, populations, of, the, region, appear, to, have, been, genetically, independent, from, the, rest, of, the, world, since, their, divergence, about, 50, 000, years, ago, he, writes, there, is, no, evidence, for, south, asian, gene, flow, to, australia, despite, sahul, being, a, single, connected, landmass, until, different, groups, across, australia, are, nearly, equally, related, to, papuans, and, vice, versa, and, the, two, appear, to, have, separated, genetically, already, aboriginal, australians, possess, inherited, abilities, to, adapt, to, a, wide, range, of, environmental, temperatures, in, various, ways, a, study, in, 1958, comparing, cold, adaptation, in, the, desert, dwelling, pitjantjatjara, people, compared, with, a, group, of, european, people, showed, that, the, cooling, adaptation, of, the, aboriginal, group, differed, from, that, of, the, white, people, and, that, they, were, able, to, sleep, more, soundly, through, a, cold, desert, night, a, 2014, cambridge, university, study, found, that, a, beneficial, mutation, in, two, genes, which, regulate, thyroxine, a, hormone, involved, in, regulating, body, metabolism, helps, to, regulate, body, temperature, in, response, to, fever, the, effect, of, this, is, that, the, desert, people, are, able, to, have, a, higher, body, temperature, without, accelerating, the, activity, of, the, whole, of, the, body, which, can, be, especially, detrimental, in, childhood, diseases, this, helps, protect, people, to, survive, the, side, effects, of, infection, aboriginal, people, have, lived, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, on, the, continent, of, australia, through, its, various, changes, in, landmass, the, area, within, australia, s, borders, today, includes, the, islands, of, tasmania, k, gari, previously, fraser, island, hinchinbrook, island, the, tiwi, islands, kangaroo, island, and, groote, eylandt, indigenous, people, of, the, torres, strait, islands, however, are, not, aboriginal, in, the, 2021, census, people, who, self, identified, on, the, census, form, as, being, of, aboriginal, and, or, torres, strait, islander, origin, totalled, 812, 728, out, of, a, total, of, 25, 422, 788, australians, equating, to, 3, 2, of, australia, s, population, and, an, increase, of, 163, 557, people, or, 25, 2, since, the, previous, census, in, 2016, reasons, for, the, increase, were, broadly, as, follows, most, aboriginal, people, speak, english, with, aboriginal, phrases, and, words, being, added, to, create, australian, aboriginal, english, which, also, has, a, tangible, influence, of, aboriginal, languages, in, the, phonology, and, grammatical, structure, some, aboriginal, people, especially, those, living, in, remote, areas, are, multi, lingual, many, of, the, original, 250, 400, aboriginal, languages, more, than, 250, languages, and, about, 800, dialectal, varieties, on, the, continent, are, endangered, or, extinct, although, some, efforts, are, being, made, at, language, revival, for, some, as, of, 2016, only, 13, traditional, indigenous, languages, were, still, being, acquired, by, children, and, about, another, 100, spoken, by, older, generations, only, dispersing, across, the, australian, continent, over, time, the, ancient, people, expanded, and, differentiated, into, distinct, groups, each, with, its, own, language, and, culture, more, than, 400, distinct, australian, aboriginal, peoples, have, been, identified, distinguished, by, names, designating, their, ancestral, languages, dialects, or, distinctive, speech, patterns, according, to, noted, anthropologist, archaeologist, and, sociologist, harry, lourandos, historically, these, groups, lived, in, three, main, cultural, areas, the, northern, southern, and, central, cultural, areas, the, northern, and, southern, areas, having, richer, natural, marine, and, woodland, resources, were, more, densely, populated, than, the, central, area, there, are, various, other, names, from, australian, aboriginal, languages, commonly, used, to, identify, groups, based, on, geography, known, as, demonyms, including, other, group, names, are, based, on, the, language, group, or, specific, dialect, spoken, these, also, coincide, with, geographical, regions, of, varying, sizes, a, few, examples, are, however, these, lists, are, neither, exhaustive, nor, definitive, and, there, are, overlaps, different, approaches, have, been, taken, by, non, aboriginal, scholars, in, trying, to, understand, and, define, aboriginal, culture, and, societies, some, focusing, on, the, micro, level, tribe, clan, etc, and, others, on, shared, languages, and, cultural, practices, spread, over, large, regions, defined, by, ecological, factors, anthropologists, have, encountered, many, difficulties, in, trying, to, define, what, constitutes, an, aboriginal, people, community, group, tribe, let, alone, naming, them, knowledge, of, pre, colonial, aboriginal, cultures, and, societal, groupings, is, still, largely, dependent, on, the, observers, interpretations, which, were, filtered, through, colonial, ways, of, viewing, societies, some, aboriginal, peoples, identify, as, one, of, several, saltwater, freshwater, rainforest, or, desert, peoples, the, term, aboriginal, australians, includes, many, distinct, peoples, who, have, developed, across, australia, for, over, 50, 000, years, these, peoples, have, a, broadly, shared, though, complex, genetic, history, but, it, is, only, in, the, last, two, hundred, years, that, they, have, been, defined, and, started, to, self, identify, as, a, single, group, socio, politically, while, some, preferred, the, term, aborigine, to, aboriginal, in, the, past, as, the, latter, was, seen, to, have, more, directly, discriminatory, legal, origins, use, of, the, term, aborigine, has, declined, in, recent, decades, as, many, consider, the, term, an, offensive, and, racist, hangover, from, australia, s, colonial, era, the, definition, of, the, term, aboriginal, has, changed, over, time, and, place, with, the, importance, of, family, lineage, self, identification, and, community, acceptance, all, being, of, varying, importance, the, term, indigenous, australians, refers, to, aboriginal, australians, and, torres, strait, islander, peoples, and, the, term, is, conventionally, only, used, when, both, groups, are, included, in, the, topic, being, addressed, or, by, self, identification, by, a, person, as, indigenous, torres, strait, islanders, are, ethnically, and, culturally, distinct, despite, extensive, cultural, exchange, with, some, of, the, aboriginal, groups, and, the, torres, strait, islands, are, mostly, part, of, queensland, but, have, a, separate, governmental, status, some, aboriginal, people, object, to, being, labelled, indigenous, as, an, artificial, and, denialist, term, australian, indigenous, people, have, beliefs, unique, to, each, mob, tribe, and, have, a, strong, connection, to, the, land, contemporary, indigenous, australian, beliefs, are, a, complex, mixture, varying, by, region, and, individual, across, the, continent, they, are, shaped, by, traditional, beliefs, the, disruption, of, colonisation, religions, brought, to, the, continent, by, europeans, and, contemporary, issues, traditional, cultural, beliefs, are, passed, down, and, shared, by, dancing, stories, songlines, and, art, especially, papunya, tula, dot, painting, collectively, telling, the, story, of, creation, known, as, the, dreamtime, additionally, traditional, healers, were, also, custodians, of, important, dreaming, stories, as, well, as, their, medical, roles, for, example, the, ngangkari, in, the, western, desert, some, core, structures, and, themes, are, shared, across, the, continent, with, details, and, additional, elements, varying, between, language, and, cultural, groups, for, example, in, the, dreamtime, of, most, regions, a, spirit, creates, the, earth, then, tells, the, humans, to, treat, the, animals, and, the, earth, in, a, way, which, is, respectful, to, land, in, northern, territory, this, is, commonly, said, to, be, a, huge, snake, or, snakes, that, weaved, its, way, through, the, earth, and, sky, making, the, mountains, and, oceans, but, in, other, places, the, spirits, who, created, the, world, are, known, as, wandjina, rain, and, water, spirits, major, ancestral, spirits, include, the, rainbow, serpent, baiame, dirawong, and, bunjil, similarly, the, arrernte, people, of, central, australia, believed, that, humanity, originated, from, great, superhuman, ancestors, who, brought, the, sun, wind, and, rain, as, a, result, of, breaking, through, the, surface, of, the, earth, when, waking, from, their, slumber, taken, as, a, whole, aboriginal, australians, along, with, torres, strait, islander, people, have, a, number, of, health, and, economic, deprivations, in, comparison, with, the, wider, australian, community, due, to, the, aforementioned, disadvantage, aboriginal, australian, communities, experience, a, higher,
