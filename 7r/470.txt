districts, of, karnataka, and, kanyakumari, coimbatore, and, nilgiris, district, of, tamil, nadu, it, is, also, spoken, by, the, malayali, diaspora, worldwide, especially, in, the, persian, gulf, countries, due, to, the, large, populations, of, malayali, expatriates, there, they, are, a, significant, population, in, each, city, in, india, including, mumbai, bengaluru, chennai, delhi, hyderabad, etc, the, origin, of, malayalam, remains, a, matter, of, dispute, among, scholars, the, mainstream, view, holds, that, malayalam, descends, from, early, middle, tamil, and, sanskrit, and, separated, from, it, sometime, between, the, 9th, and, 13th, centuries, a, second, view, argues, for, the, development, of, the, two, languages, out, of, proto, dravidian, or, proto, tamil, malayalam, in, the, prehistoric, era, although, this, is, generally, rejected, by, historical, linguists, the, quilon, syrian, copper, plates, of, 849, 850, ce, are, considered, by, some, to, be, the, oldest, available, inscription, written, in, old, malayalam, however, the, existence, of, old, malayalam, is, sometimes, disputed, by, scholars, they, regard, the, chera, perumal, inscriptional, language, as, a, diverging, dialect, or, variety, of, contemporary, tamil, the, oldest, extant, literary, work, in, malayalam, distinct, from, the, tamil, tradition, is, ramacharitam, late, 12th, or, early, 13th, century, the, earliest, script, used, to, write, malayalam, was, the, vatteluttu, script, the, current, malayalam, script, is, based, on, the, vatteluttu, script, which, was, extended, with, grantha, script, letters, to, adopt, indo, aryan, loanwords, it, bears, high, similarity, with, the, tigalari, script, a, historical, script, that, was, used, to, write, the, tulu, language, in, south, canara, and, sanskrit, in, the, adjacent, malabar, region, the, modern, malayalam, grammar, is, based, on, the, book, kerala, panineeyam, written, by, a, r, raja, raja, varma, in, late, 19th, century, ce, the, first, travelogue, in, any, indian, language, is, the, malayalam, varthamanappusthakam, written, by, paremmakkal, thoma, kathanar, in, 1785, robert, caldwell, describes, the, extent, of, malayalam, in, the, 19th, century, as, extending, from, the, vicinity, of, kumbla, in, the, north, where, it, supersedes, with, tulu, to, kanyakumari, in, the, south, where, it, begins, to, be, superseded, by, tamil, beside, the, inhabited, islands, of, lakshadweep, in, the, arabian, sea, the, word, malayalam, originated, from, the, words, mala, meaning, mountain, and, alam, meaning, region, or, ship, as, in, township, malayalam, thus, translates, directly, as, the, mountain, region, the, term, malabar, was, used, as, an, alternative, term, for, malayalam, in, foreign, trade, circles, to, denote, the, southwestern, coast, of, the, indian, peninsula, which, also, means, the, land, of, hills, the, term, originally, referred, to, the, western, hilly, land, of, the, chera, dynasty, later, zamorins, and, the, kingdom, of, cochin, kingdom, of, ezhimala, later, kolathunadu, and, ay, kingdom, later, travancore, and, only, later, became, the, name, of, its, language, the, language, malayalam, was, alternatively, called, alealum, malayalani, malayali, malabari, malean, maliyad, mallealle, and, kerala, bhasha, until, the, early, 19th, century, ce, the, earliest, extant, literary, works, in, the, regional, language, of, present, day, kerala, probably, date, back, to, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, at, that, time, the, language, was, differentiated, by, the, name, kerala, bhasha, the, distinctive, malayalam, named, identity, of, this, language, appears, to, have, come, into, existence, only, around, the, 16th, century, when, it, was, known, as, malayayma, or, malayanma, the, words, were, also, used, to, refer, to, the, script, and, the, region, according, to, duarte, barbosa, a, portuguese, visitor, who, visited, kerala, in, the, early, 16th, century, ce, the, people, in, the, southwestern, malabar, coast, of, india, from, kumbla, in, north, to, kanyakumari, in, south, had, a, unique, language, which, was, called, maliama, by, them, prior, to, this, period, the, people, of, kerala, usually, referred, to, their, language, as, tamil, and, both, terms, overlapped, into, the, colonial, period, due, to, the, geographical, isolation, of, the, malabar, coast, from, the, rest, of, the, indian, peninsula, due, to, the, presence, of, the, western, ghats, mountain, ranges, which, lie, parallel, to, the, coast, the, dialect, of, old, tamil, spoken, in, kerala, was, different, from, that, spoken, in, tamil, nadu, the, mainstream, view, holds, that, malayalam, began, to, grow, as, a, distinct, literary, language, from, the, western, coastal, dialect, of, middle, tamil, and, the, linguistic, separation, completed, sometime, between, the, 9th, and, 13th, centuries, the, renowned, poets, of, classical, tamil, such, as, paranar, 1st, century, ce, ilango, adigal, 2nd, 3rd, century, ce, and, kulasekhara, alvar, 9th, century, ce, were, keralites, the, sangam, works, can, be, considered, as, the, ancient, predecessor, of, malayalam, some, scholars, however, believe, that, both, tamil, and, malayalam, developed, during, the, prehistoric, period, from, a, common, ancestor, proto, tamil, malayalam, and, that, the, notion, of, malayalam, being, a, daughter, of, tamil, is, misplaced, this, is, based, on, the, fact, that, malayalam, and, several, dravidian, languages, on, the, western, coast, have, common, archaic, features, which, are, not, found, even, in, the, oldest, historical, forms, of, literary, tamil, despite, this, malayalam, shares, many, common, innovations, with, tamil, that, emerged, during, the, early, middle, tamil, period, thus, making, independent, descent, impossible, for, example, old, tamil, lacks, the, first, and, second, person, plural, pronouns, with, the, ending, ka, it, is, in, the, early, middle, tamil, stage, that, ka, first, appears, indeed, most, features, of, malayalam, morphology, are, derivable, from, a, form, of, speech, corresponding, to, early, middle, tamil, robert, caldwell, in, his, 1856, book, a, comparative, grammar, of, the, dravidian, or, south, indian, family, of, languages, opined, that, literary, malayalam, branched, from, classical, tamil, and, over, time, gained, a, large, amount, of, sanskrit, vocabulary, and, lost, the, personal, terminations, of, verbs, as, the, language, of, scholarship, and, administration, old, tamil, which, was, written, in, tamil, brahmi, and, the, vatteluttu, alphabet, later, greatly, influenced, the, early, development, of, malayalam, as, a, literary, language, the, malayalam, script, began, to, diverge, from, the, vatteluttu, and, the, western, grantha, scripts, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, of, common, era, by, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, a, written, form, of, the, language, emerged, which, was, unique, from, the, vatteluttu, script, that, was, used, to, write, tamil, on, the, eastern, coast, old, malayalam, pa, aya, malay, am, an, inscriptional, language, found, in, kerala, from, circa, 9th, to, circa, 13th, century, ce, is, the, earliest, attested, form, of, malayalam, the, beginning, of, the, development, of, old, malayalam, from, a, western, coastal, dialect, of, middle, tamil, can, be, dated, to, circa, 8th, century, ce, it, remained, a, west, coast, dialect, until, circa, 9th, century, ce, or, a, little, later, the, origin, of, malayalam, calendar, dates, back, to, year, 825, ce, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, western, coastal, dialect, of, tamil, began, to, separate, diverge, and, grow, as, a, distinct, language, due, to, geographical, separation, of, kerala, from, the, tamil, country, and, the, influence, of, sanskrit, and, prakrit, from, the, nambudiri, brahmins, of, the, malabar, coast, the, old, malayalam, language, was, employed, in, several, official, records, and, transactions, at, the, level, of, the, chera, perumal, kings, as, well, as, the, upper, caste, nambudiri, village, temples, most, of, the, inscriptions, in, old, malayalam, were, found, from, the, northern, districts, of, kerala, those, lie, adjacent, to, tulu, nadu, old, malayalam, was, mostly, written, in, vatteluttu, script, with, pallava, southern, grantha, characters, old, malayalam, had, several, features, distinct, from, the, contemporary, tamil, which, include, the, nasalisation, of, adjoining, sounds, substitution, of, palatal, sounds, for, dental, sounds, contraction, of, vowels, and, the, rejection, of, gender, verbs, ramacharitam, and, thirunizhalmala, are, the, possible, literary, works, of, old, malayalam, found, so, far, old, malayalam, gradually, developed, into, middle, malayalam, madhyakaala, malayalam, by, the, 13th, century, ce, malayalam, literature, also, completely, diverged, from, tamil, literature, during, this, period, works, including, unniyachi, charitham, unnichiruthevi, charitham, and, unniyadi, charitham, are, written, in, middle, malayalam, and, date, back, to, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, of, the, common, era, the, sandesha, kavya, s, of, 14th,

middle, malayalam, the, literary, works, of, this, period, were, heavily, influenced, by, manipravalam, which, was, a, combination, of, contemporary, tamil, and, sanskrit, the, word, mani, pravalam, literally, means, diamond, coral, or, ruby, coral, the, 14th, century, lilatilakam, text, states, manipravalam, to, be, a, bhashya, language, where, dravida, and, sanskrit, should, combine, together, like, ruby, and, coral, without, the, least, trace, of, any, discord, the, scripts, of, kolezhuthu, and, malayanma, were, also, used, to, write, middle, malayalam, in, addition, to, vatteluthu, and, grantha, script, those, were, used, to, write, old, malayalam, the, literary, works, written, in, middle, malayalam, were, heavily, influenced, by, sanskrit, and, prakrit, while, comparing, them, with, the, modern, malayalam, literature, the, middle, malayalam, was, succeeded, by, modern, malayalam, aadhunika, malayalam, by, 15th, century, ce, the, poem, krishnagatha, written, by, cherusseri,

are, also, included, in, the, earliest, form, of, modern, malayalam, thunchaththu, ezhuthachan, is, also, credited, with, developing, the, malayalam, script, into, the, current, form, through, the,
