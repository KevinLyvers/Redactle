cognitive, development, is, a, field, of, study, in, neuroscience, and, psychology, focusing, on, a, child, s, development, in, terms, of, information, processing, conceptual, resources, perceptual, skill, language, learning, and, other, aspects, of, the, developed, adult, brain, and, cognitive, psychology, qualitative, differences, between, how, a, child, processes, their, waking, experience, and, how, an, adult, processes, their, waking, experience, are, acknowledged, such, as, object, permanence, the, understanding, of, logical, relations, and, cause, effect, reasoning, in, school, age, children, cognitive, development, is, defined, as, the, emergence, of, the, ability, to, consciously, cognize, understand, and, articulate, their, understanding, in, adult, terms, cognitive, development, is, how, a, person, perceives, thinks, and, gains, understanding, of, their, world, through, the, relations, of, genetic, and, learning, factors, there, are, four, stages, to, cognitive, information, development, they, are, reasoning, intelligence, language, and, memory, these, stages, start, when, the, baby, is, about, 18, months, old, they, play, with, toys, listen, to, their, parents, speak, they, watch, tv, anything, that, catches, their, attention, helps, build, their, cognitive, development, jean, piaget, was, a, major, force, establishing, this, field, forming, his, theory, of, cognitive, development, piaget, proposed, four, stages, of, cognitive, development, the, sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete, operational, and, formal, operational, period, many, of, piaget, s, theoretical, claims, have, since, fallen, out, of, favor, his, description, of, the, most, prominent, changes, in, cognition, with, age, is, generally, still, accepted, today, e, g, how, early, perception, moves, from, being, dependent, on, concrete, external, actions, later, abstract, understanding, of, observable, aspects, of, reality, can, be, captured, leading, to, the, discovery, of, underlying, abstract, rules, and, principles, usually, starting, in, adolescence, in, recent, years, however, alternative, models, have, been, advanced, including, information, processing, theory, neo, piagetian, theories, of, cognitive, development, which, aim, to, integrate, piaget, s, ideas, with, more, recent, models, and, concepts, in, developmental, and, cognitive, science, theoretical, cognitive, neuroscience, and, social, constructivist, approaches, another, such, model, of, cognitive, development, is, bronfenbrenner, s, ecological, systems, theory, a, major, controversy, in, cognitive, development, has, been, nature, versus, nurture, i, e, the, question, if, cognitive, development, is, mainly, determined, by, an, individual, s, innate, qualities, nature, or, by, their, personal, experiences, nurture, however, it, is, now, recognized, by, most, experts, that, this, is, a, false, dichotomy, there, is, overwhelming, evidence, from, biological, and, behavioral, sciences, that, from, the, earliest, points, in, development, gene, activity, interacts, with, events, and, experiences, in, the, environment, while, naturalists, are, convinced, of, the, power, of, genetic, mechanisms, knowledge, from, different, disciplines, such, as, comparative, psychology, molecular, biology, and, neuroscience, shows, arguments, for, an, ecological, component, in, launching, cognition, see, the, section, the, beginning, of, cognition, below, jean, piaget, is, inexorably, linked, to, cognitive, development, as, he, was, the, first, to, systematically, study, developmental, processes, despite, being, the, first, to, develop, a, systemic, study, of, cognitive, development, piaget, was, not, the, first, to, theorize, about, cognitive, development, jean, jacques, rousseau, wrote, emile, or, on, education, in, 1762, he, discusses, childhood, development, as, happening, in, three, stages, in, the, first, stage, up, to, age, 12, the, child, is, guided, by, their, emotions, and, impulses, in, the, second, stage, ages, 12, 16, the, child, s, reason, starts, to, develop, in, the, third, and, final, stage, age, 16, and, up, the, child, develops, into, an, adult, james, sully, wrote, several, books, on, childhood, development, including, studies, of, childhood, in, 1895, and, children, s, ways, in, 1897, he, used, a, detailed, observational, study, method, with, the, children, contemporary, research, in, child, development, actually, repeats, observations, and, observational, methods, summarized, by, sully, in, studies, of, childhood, such, as, the, mirror, technique, sigmund, freud, developed, the, theory, of, psychosexual, development, which, indicates, children, must, pass, through, several, stages, as, they, develop, their, cognitive, skills, maria, montessori, began, her, career, working, with, mentally, disabled, children, in, 1897, then, conducted, observation, and, experimental, research, in, elementary, schools, she, wrote, the, discovery, of, the, child, in, 1950, which, developed, the, montessori, method, of, education, she, discussed, four, planes, of, development, birth, to, 6, years, 6, to, 12, 12, to, 18, and, 18, to, 24, the, montessori, method, now, has, three, developmentally, meaningful, age, groups, 2, 2, 5, years, 2, 5, 6, and, 6, 12, she, was, working, on, human, behavior, in, older, children, but, only, published, lecture, notes, on, the, subject, arnold, gesell, was, the, creator, of, the, maturational, theory, of, development, gesell, said, that, development, occurs, due, to, biological, hereditary, features, such, as, genetics, and, children, will, reach, developmental, milestones, when, they, are, ready, to, do, so, in, a, predictable, sequence, because, of, his, theory, of, development, he, devised, a, developmental, scale, that, is, used, today, called, the, gesell, developmental, schedule, gds, that, provides, parents, teachers, doctors, and, other, pertinent, people, with, an, overview, of, where, an, infant, or, child, falls, on, the, developmental, spectrum, erik, erikson, was, a, neo, freudian, who, focused, on, how, children, develop, personality, and, identity, although, a, contemporary, of, freud, there, is, a, larger, focus, on, social, experiences, that, occur, across, the, lifespan, as, opposed, to, childhood, exclusively, that, contribute, to, how, personality, and, identity, emerge, his, framework, uses, eight, systematic, stages, that, all, children, must, pass, through, urie, bronfenbrenner, devised, the, ecological, systems, theory, which, identifies, various, levels, of, a, child, s, environment, the, primary, focus, of, this, theory, focuses, on, the, quality, and, context, of, a, child, s, environment, bronfenbrenner, suggested, that, as, a, child, grows, older, their, interaction, between, the, various, levels, of, their, environment, grows, more, complex, due, to, cognitive, abilities, expanding, lawrence, kohlberg, wrote, the, theory, of, stages, of, moral, development, which, extended, piaget, s, findings, of, cognitive, development, and, showed, that, they, continue, through, the, lifespan, kohlberg, s, six, stages, follow, piaget, s, constructivist, requirements, in, that, those, stages, can, not, be, skipped, and, it, is, very, rare, to, regress, in, stages, notable, works, moral, stages, and, moralization, the, cognitive, development, approach, 1976, and, essays, on, moral, development, 1981, lev, vygotsky, s, theory, is, based, on, social, learning, as, the, most, important, aspect, of, cognitive, development, in, vygotsky, s, theory, adults, are, very, important, for, young, children, s, development, they, help, children, learn, through, mediation, which, is, modeling, and, explaining, concepts, together, adults, and, children, master, concepts, of, their, culture, and, activities, vygotsky, believed, we, get, our, complex, mental, activities, through, social, learning, a, significant, part, of, vygotsky, s, theory, is, based, on, the, zone, of, proximal, development, which, he, believes, is, when, the, most, effective, learning, takes, place, the, zone, of, proximal, development, is, what, a, child, cannot, accomplish, alone, but, can, accomplish, with, the, help, of, an, mko, more, knowledgeable, other, vygotsky, also, believed, culture, is, a, very, important, part, of, cognitive, development, such, as, the, language, writing, and, counting, system, used, in, that, culture, another, aspect, of, vygotsky, s, theory, is, private, speech, private, speech, is, when, a, person, talks, to, themselves, in, order, to, help, themselves, problem, solve, scaffolding, or, providing, support, to, a, child, and, then, slowly, removing, support, and, allowing, the, child, to, do, more, on, their, own, over, time, is, also, an, aspect, of, vygotsky, s, theory, in, cognitive, development, the, essential, issue, in, beginning, cognition, is, how, the, nervous, system, grasps, perception, and, shapes, intentionality, in, the, sensorimotor, stage, or, before, when, organisms, only, demonstrate, simple, reflexes, see, articles, perception, cognition, binding, problem, multi, sensory, integration, the, significance, of, this, knowledge, is, that, the, mode, to, cognize, at, the, stage, without, communication, and, abstract, thinking, being, a, pre, requisite, of, social, reality, formation, determines, the, development, of, everything, from, cooperative, interactions, and, knowledge, assimilation, to, moral, identity, and, cultural, evolution, that, provides, building, societies, see, also, social, cognition, and, collective, behaviour, the, contemporary, academic, discussion, on, a, controversy, in, cognitive, development, whether, cognitive, development, is, mainly, determined, by, an, individual, s, innate, qualities, or, personal, experiences, is, still, in, progress, many, influential, scientists, argue, that, the, genetic, code, is, no, more, than, a, rule, of, causal, specificity, based, on, the, fact, that, cells, use, nucleic, acids, as, templates, for, the, primary, structure, of, proteins, however, it, is, unacceptable, to, say, that, dna, contains, the, information, for, phenotypic, design, the, epigenetic, approach, to, human, psychological, development, that, cascading, phenotypic, effects, are, not, encoded, directly, in, the, genes, contrasts, sharply, with, many, so, called, nativist, approaches, opponents, of, innate, knowledge, discuss, four, problems, in, appearance, of, the, perception, of, objects, the, binding, problem, according, to, cognitive, psychologist, anne, treisman, the, binding, problem, can, be, divided, into, three, separate, problems, 1, how, are, relevant, elements, that, should, be, related, as, a, whole, selected, and, separated, from, elements, that, belong, to, other, objects, ideas, or, events, 2, how, is, the, binding, encoded, so, it, can, be, transferred, to, other, brain, systems, and, used, 3, how, are, the, correct, relationships, between, related, elements, within, the, same, object, defined, this, problem, is, also, connected, to, the, problem, of, multisensory, integration, in, perception, the, perception, stability, problem, according, to, research, professor, of, liepaja, university, igor, val, danilov, newborns, and, infants, cannot, capture, the, same, picture, of, the, environment, as, adults, because, of, their, immature, sensory, systems, they, cannot, sense, environmental, stimuli, from, social, phenomena, to, the, same, extent, as, adults, the, outcomes, of, processing, similar, sensory, stimuli, in, immature, and, mature, organisms, differ, the, corresponding, holistic, representations, of, objects, can, hardly, occur, in, these, organisms, the, excitatory, inputs, problem, according, to, the, received, view, in, cognitive, sciences, cognition, develops, due, to, experience, dependent, neuronal, plasticity, e, g, neuronal, plasticity, refers, to, the, capacity, of, the, nervous, system, to, modify, itself, functionally, and, structurally, in, response, to, experience, and, injury, however, the, structural, organization, of, excitatory, inputs, supporting, spike, timing, dependent, plasticity, remains, unknown, how, is, the, relation, between, a, specific, sensory, stimulus, and, the, appropriate, structural, organization, of, the, excitatory, inputs, in, specific, neurons, formed, the, problem, of, morphogenesis, cell, actions, during, an, embryo, formation, including, shape, changes, cell, contact, remodeling, cell, migration, cell, division, and, cell, extrusion, need, control, over, cell, mechanics, this, complex, dynamical, process, is, associated, with, protrusive, contractile, and, adhesive, forces, and, hydrostatic, pressure, as, well, as, material, properties, of, cells, that, dictate, how, cells, respond, to, active, stresses, precise, coordination, of, all, cells, is, a, necessary, condition, moreover, such, a, complex, dynamical, process, likely, requires, clear, parameters, of, the, final, biological, structure, the, complete, developmental, program, with, a, template, for, accomplishing, it, collinet, and, lecuit, 2021, pose, a, question, what, forces, or, mechanisms, at, the, cellular, level, manage, four, very, general, classes, of, tissue, deformation, namely, tissue, folding, and, invagination, tissue, flow, and, extension, tissue, hollowing, and, finally, tissue, branching, they, challenge, the, nativists, notion, that, shape, is, fully, encoded, and, determined, by, genes, how, are, cell, mechanics, and, associated, cell, behaviors, robustly, organized, in, space, and, time, during, tissue, morphogenesis, they, argue, that, not, only, gene, expression, and, the, resulting, biochemical, cues, but, also, mechanics, and, geometry, act, as, sources, of, morphogenetic, information, to, ultimately, define, the, time, and, length, scales, of, the, cell, behaviors, driving, morphogenesis, thus, it, is, not, only, the, interaction, of, gene, activity, with, events, and, experiences, in, the, environment, that, contributes, to, the, formation, of, tissues, in, morphogenesis, because, the, nervous, system, structures, operate, over, everything, that, makes, us, human, the, formation, of, neural, tissues, in, a, certain, way, is, essential, for, shaping, cognitive, functions, according, to, research, professor, igor, val, danilov, such, a, complex, process, of, shaping, the, determined, structure, of, the, nervous, system, requires, a, complete, developmental, program, with, a, template, for, accomplishing, the, final, biological, structure, of, the, nervous, system, indeed, because, even, processes, of, the, cell, coupling, for, shaping, a, nervous, system, during, embryonal, development, challenge, the, naturalistic, approach, how, the, nervous, system, grasps, perception, and, shapes, intentionality, independently, i, e, without, any, template, seems, even, more, complicated, so, the, fact, that, gene, activity, interacts, with, events, and, experiences, in, the, environment, as, noted, above, may, not, fully, explain, the, integrative, complexity, of, intentionality, perception, development, for, beginning, cognitive, development, nowadays, the, shared, intentionality, hypothesis, is, the, only, one, that, attempts, to, explain, neurophysiological, processes, at, the, beginning, of, cognitive, development, at, different, levels, of, interaction, from, interpersonal, dynamics, to, neuronal, interactions, it, also, solves, the, above, noted, problems, professor, of, psychology, michael, tomasello, hypothesised, that, social, bonds, between, children, and, caregivers, would, gradually, increase, through, the, essential, motive, force, of, shared, intentionality, beginning, from, birth, the, notion, of, shared, intentionality, introduced, by, michael, tomasello, was, developed, by, research, professor, igor, val, danilov, expanding, it, to, the, intrauterine, period, the, shared, intentionality, approach, also, points, out, that, an, innate, sensitivity, to, specific, patterns, of, information, mentioned, in, the, section, speculated, core, systems, of, cognition, is, also, the, outcome, of, shared, intentionality, with, caregivers, who, obviously, participated, in, the, experiments, jean, piaget, was, the, first, psychologist, and, philosopher, to, brand, this, type, of, study, as, cognitive, development, other, researchers, in, multiple, disciplines, had, studied, development, in, children, before, but, piaget, is, often, credited, as, being, the, first, one, to, make, a, systematic, study, of, cognitive, development, and, gave, it, its, name, his, main, contribution, is, the, stage, theory, of, child, cognitive, development, he, also, published, his, observational, studies, of, cognition, in, children, and, created, a, series, of, simple, tests, to, reveal, different, cognitive, abilities, in, children, piaget, believed, that, people, move, through, stages, of, development, that, allow, them, to, think, in, new, more, complex, ways, many, of, piaget, s, claims, have, fallen, out, of, favor, for, example, he, claimed, that, young, children, cannot, conserve, numbers, however, further, experiments, showed, that, children, did, not, really, understand, what, was, being, asked, of, them, when, the, experiment, is, done, with, candies, and, the, children, are, asked, which, set, they, want, rather, than, having, to, tell, an, adult, which, is, more, they, show, no, confusion, about, which, group, has, more, items, piaget, argues, that, the, child, cannot, conserve, numbers, if, they, do, not, understand, one, to, one, correspondence, piaget, s, theory, of, cognitive, development, ends, at, the, formal, operational, stage, that, is, usually, developed, in, early, adulthood, it, does, not, take, into, account, later, stages, of, adult, cognitive, development, as, described, by, for, example, harvard, university, professor, robert, kegan, additionally, piaget, largely, ignores, the, effects, of, social, and, cultural, upbringing, on, stages, of, development, because, he, only, examined, children, from, western, societies, this, matters, as, certain, societies, and, cultures, have, different, early, childhood, experiences, for, example, individuals, in, nomadic, tribes, struggle, with, number, counting, and, object, counting, certain, cultures, have, specific, activities, and, events, that, are, common, at, a, younger, age, which, can, affect, aspects, such, as, object, permeance, this, indicates, that, children, from, different, societies, may, achieve, a, stage, like, the, formal, operational, stage, while, in, other, societies, children, at, the, exact, same, age, remain, in, the, concrete, operational, stage, piaget, believed, that, infants, entered, a, sensorimotor, stage, which, lasts, from, birth, until, age, 2, in, this, stage, individuals, use, their, senses, to, investigate, and, interact, with, their, environment, through, this, they, develop, coordination, between, the, sensory, input, and, motor, responses, piaget, also, theorized, that, this, stage, ended, with, the, acquisition, of, object, permanence, and, the, emergence, of, symbolic, thought, this, view, collapsed, in, the, 1980s, when, research, was, put, out, showing, that, infants, as, young, as, five, months, are, able, to, represent, out, of, sight, objects, as, well, their, properties, such, as, number, and, rigidity, piaget, believed, that, children, entered, a, preoperational, stage, from, roughly, age, 2, until, age, 7, this, stage, involves, the, development, of, symbolic, thought, which, manifests, in, children, s, increased, ability, to, play, pretend, this, stage, involves, language, acquisition, but, also, the, inability, to, understand, complex, logic, or, to, manipulate, information, subsequent, work, suggesting, that, preschoolers, were, indeed, capable, of, taking, others, perspectives, into, account, and, reasoning, about, abstract, relationships, including, causal, relationships, marked, the, demise, of, this, aspect, of, stage, theory, as, well, piaget, believed, that, the, concrete, operational, stage, spanned, roughly, from, age, 6, through, age, 12, this, stage, is, marked, by, the, development, and, achievement, of, skills, such, as, conservation, classification, serialism, and, spatial, reasoning, work, suggesting, that, much, younger, children, reason, about, abstract, ideas, including, kinds, logical, operators, and, causal, relationships, rendered, this, aspect, of, stage, theory, obsolete, piaget, believed, that, the, formal, operational, stage, spans, roughly, from, age, 12, through, adulthood, and, is, marked, by, the, ability, to, apply, mental, operations, to, abstract, ideas, erikson, worked, with, freud, but, unlike, freud, erikson, focused, on, biological, psychological, and, social, factors, in, human, development, each, stage, is, rooted, in, some, kind, of, competence, or, perceived, ability, to, do, things, each, stage, is, defined, by, 2, conflicting, psychological, tendencies, and, by, what, traits, develop, in, the, stage, dependent, on, how, much, of, each, tendency, was, experienced, there, are, virtues, that, develop, in, healthy, circumstances, and, maladaptations, that, develop, in, unhealthy, circumstances, it, consists, of, 8, stages, while, the, conflicting, tendencies, may, appear, to, be, good, versus, bad, they, can, be, considered, as, a, balance, where, most, healthy, individuals, experience, some, of, each, a, baby, has, very, little, ability, to, do, anything, for, themself, as, such, infants, develop, according, to, whether, they, learn, to, trust, or, distrust, the, world, around, them, the, virtue, that, arises, during, this, stage, is, hope, and, the, maladaptation, is, withdrawal, as, a, child, starts, to, explore, the, world, the, conflict, they, experience, is, autonomy, or, a, feeling, of, being, able, to, do, things, themselves, verses, shame, or, doubt, which, is, a, feeling, of, being, unable, to, do, things, themselves, and, fear, of, making, mistakes, the, virtue, that, arises, during, this, period, is, will, suggesting, a, control, over, one, s, actions, the, maladaptation, for, this, stage, is, compulsion, or, lack, of, control, over, one, s, actions, as, a, child, grows, from, the, stage, of, autonomy, verses, shame, they, experience, the, conflict, of, initiative, vs, guilt, initiative, or, having, the, ability, to, act, in, a, situation, against, guilt, or, feeling, bad, about, their, actions, or, feeling, incapable, of, acting, the, virtue, that, develops, in, this, stage, is, purpose, and, the, maladaptation, is, inhibition, as, a, child, s, awareness, of, their, effect, on, the, world, around, them, grows, they, come, to, the, conflict, of, industry, and, inferiority, industry, meaning, ability, and, willingness, to, proactively, interact, with, the, world, around, them, and, inferiority, meaning, incapability, or, perceived, incapability, to, interact, with, the, world, the, virtue, that, is, learned, in, this, stage, is, competence, and, the, maladaptation, is, inertia, or, passivity, as, a, child, grows, into, adolescence, their, ability, to, interact, with, the, world, starts, to, interact, with, their, perceptions, of, who, they, are, and, they, find, themselves, in, a, conflict, between, identity, and, identity, confusion, identity, means, knowledge, of, who, they, are, and, developing, their, own, sense, of, right, and, wrong, identity, confusion, meaning, confusion, over, who, they, are, and, what, right, and, wrong, is, to, them, the, virtue, that, is, developed, is, fidelity, and, the, maldevelopment, is, repudiation, during, young, adulthood, people, find, themselves, in, a, place, where, they, are, looking, for, belonging, in, a, small, number, of, close, relationships, intimacy, suggests, finding, very, close, relationships, with, other, people, and, isolation, is, a, lack, of, such, a, connection, the, virtue, that, can, arise, from, this, is, love, and, the, maladaptation, is, distantiation, in, this, stage, of, life, people, find, that, along, with, accomplishing, personal, goals, they, are, either, giving, to, the, next, generation, whether, as, a, mentor, or, a, parent, or, they, turn, towards, themselves, and, keep, a, distance, from, others, the, virtue, that, arises, in, this, stage, is, caring, and, the, maladaptation, is, rejectivity, those, in, the, twilight, of, their, life, look, back, at, their, lives, and, either, are, satisfied, with, their, life, s, work, or, feel, great, regret, this, satisfaction, or, regret, is, a, large, part, of, their, identity, at, the, end, of, their, lives, the, virtue, that, develops, is, wisdom, and, the, maldevelopment, is, disdain, empiricists, study, how, these, skills, may, be, learned, in, such, a, short, time, the, debate, is, over, whether, these, systems, are, learned, by, general, purpose, learning, devices, or, domain, specific, cognition, moreover, many, modern, cognitive, developmental, psychologists, recognizing, that, the, term, innate, does, not, square, with, modern, knowledge, about, epigenesis, neurobiological, development, or, learning, favor, a, non, nativist, framework, researchers, who, discuss, core, systems, often, speculate, about, differences, in, thinking, and, learning, between, proposed, domains, research, suggests, that, children, have, an, innate, sensitivity, to, specific, patterns, of, information, referred, to, as, core, domains, the, discussion, of, core, knowledge, theory, focuses, on, a, few, main, systems, including, agents, objects, numbers, and, navigation, it, is, speculated, that, a, piece, of, an, infants, core, knowledge, lies, in, their, ability, to, abstractly, represent, actors, agents, are, actors, human, or, otherwise, who, process, events, and, situations, and, select, actions, based, on, goals, and, beliefs, children, expect, the, actions, of, agents, to, be, goal, directed, efficient, and, understand, that, they, have, costs, such, as, time, energy, or, effort, children, are, importantly, able, to, differentiate, between, actors, and, inanimate, objects, proving, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, concept, of, an, agent, within, the, theorized, systems, infants, core, knowledge, of, objects, has, been, one, of, the, most, extensively, studied, these, studies, suggest, that, young, infants, appear, to, have, an, early, expectation, of, object, solidity, namely, understanding, that, objects, cannot, pass, through, one, another, similarly, they, demonstrate, an, awareness, of, object, continuity, expecting, objects, to, move, on, continuous, paths, rather, than, teleporting, or, discontinuously, changing, their, locations, they, also, expect, objects, to, follow, the, laws, of, gravity, evidence, suggests, that, humans, utilize, two, core, systems, for, number, representation, approximate, representations, and, precise, representations, the, approximate, number, system, helps, to, capture, the, relationship, between, quantities, by, estimating, numerical, magnitudes, this, system, becomes, more, precise, with, age, the, second, system, helps, to, precisely, monitor, small, groups, limited, to, around, 3, for, infants, of, individual, objects, and, accurately, represent, those, numerical, quantities, very, young, children, appear, to, have, some, skill, in, navigation, this, basic, ability, to, infer, the, direction, and, distance, of, unseen, locations, develops, in, ways, that, are, not, entirely, clear, however, there, is, some, evidence, that, it, involves, the, development, of, complex, language, skills, between, 3, and, 5, years, also, there, is, evidence, that, this, skill, depends, importantly, on, visual, experience, because, congenitally, blind, individuals, have, been, found, to, have, impaired, abilities, to, infer, new, paths, between, familiar, locations, one, of, the, original, nativist, versus, empiricist, debates, was, over, depth, perception, there, is, some, evidence, that, children, less, than, 72, hours, old, can, perceive, such, complex, things, as, biological, motion, however, it, is, unclear, how, visual, experience, in, the, first, few, days, contributes, to, this, perception, there, are, far, more, elaborate, aspects, of, visual, perception, that, develop, during, infancy, and, beyond, this, approach, integrates, externalism, a, group, of, positions, in, the, philosophy, of, mind, embodied, cognition, embodied, embedded, cognition, enactivism, extended, mind, and, situated, cognition, with, the, empiricist, ideas, about, the, beginning, of, cognition, only, from, learning, in, the, environment, according, to, the, externalism, approach, communicative, symbols, are, encoded, into, the, local, topological, properties, of, neuronal, maps, which, reflect, a, dynamical, action, pattern, the, sensorimotor, neuronal, network, enables, pairing, the, relevant, cue, with, a, particular, symbol, saved, in, the, sensorimotor, structures, and, processes, that, reveals, embodied, meanings, in, this, sense, the, shared, intentionality, theory, does, not, contradict, the, core, knowledge, theory, while, complements, it, based, on, evidence, of, child, cognitive, development, experimental, data, from, research, on, child, behavior, in, the, prenatal, period, and, advances, in, inter, brain, neuroscience, research, research, professor, at, liepaja, university, igor, val, danilov, introduced, the, notion, of, non, local, neuronal, coupling, of, the, mother, and, fetus, neuronal, networks, the, term, non, local, neuronal, coupling, refers, to, the, pre, perceptual, communication, provided, by, copying, adequate, ecological, dynamics, by, one, biological, system, from, another, both, indwelling, one, environmental, context, the, naive, actor, fetus, replicates, information, from, the, experienced, agent, mother, due, to, the, synchronization, of, intrinsic, processes, of, these, dynamic, systems, embodied, information, this, non, local, neuronal, coupling, succeeds, due, to, a, low, frequency, oscillator, mother, s, heartbeats, that, coordinates, relevant, local, neuronal, networks, in, specific, subsystems, of, these, two, organisms, which, already, exhibit, gamma, activity, similar, embodied, information, in, both, the, registered, cooperative, neuronal, activity, in, inter, brain, research, so, called, mirror, neurons, is, probably, the, manifestation, of, this, non, local, neuronal, coupling, in, such, a, manner, the, experienced, agent, ensures, one, direction, conveying, information, about, an, actual, cognitive, event, toward, an, organism, at, the, simple, reflexes, stage, of, cognitive, development, without, interacting, through, sensory, signals, obviously, any, sensory, communication, between, the, mother, and, fetus, is, impossible, therefore, non, local, neuronal, coupling, mediates, environmental, learning, early, in, cognition, the, notion, of, non, local, neuronal, coupling, filled, a, gap, in, knowledge, both, in, the, core, knowledge, theory, and, the, group, of, positions, in, externalism, about, the, very, beginning, of, cognition, which, has, also, been, shown, by, the, binding, problem, the, perception, stability, problem, the, excitatory, inputs, problem, and, the, problem, of, morphogenesis, the, nervous, system, of, the, young, organism, at, the, prenatal, stage, of, development, cannot, alone, solve, the, complexity, of, intentionality, perception, development, for, beginning, cognitive, development, for, the, innate, sensitivity, to, specific, patterns, of, information, referred, to, as, core, domains, according, to, the, core, knowledge, theory, or, for, pairing, the, relevant, cue, with, a, particular, symbol, saved, in, the, sensorimotor, structures, embodied, information, according, to, externalism, the, organism, only, with, an, ability, of, reflex, responses, should, distinguish, the, relevant, stimulus, an, informative, cue, from, the, environment, with, the, cacophony, of, stimuli, electromagnetic, waves, chemical, interactions, and, pressure, fluctuations, the, notion, of, non, local, neuronal, coupling, explains, the, neurophysiological, processes, of, shared, intentionality, at, the, cellular, level, that, reveal, in, young, organisms, the, innate, sensitivity, and, or, embodied, meanings, during, cognition, the, shared, intentionality, approach, shows, how, at, different, levels, of, interaction, from, interpersonal, dynamics, to, neuronal, coupling, the, collaborative, interaction, emerges, in, the, mother, child, pairs, for, sharing, the, essential, sensory, stimulus, of, the, actual, cognitive, event, finally, research, has, already, shown, that, the, shared, intentionality, magnitude, can, be, assessed, by, emulating, the, mother, fetal, communication, model, in, dyads, of, mothers, and, children, from, 2, to, 10, years, old, a, major, well, studied, process, and, consequence, of, cognitive, development, is, language, acquisition, the, traditional, view, was, that, this, is, the, result, of, deterministic, human, specific, genetic, structures, and, processes, other, traditions, however, have, emphasized, the, role, of, social, experience, in, language, learning, however, the, relation, of, gene, activity, experience, and, language, development, is, now, recognized, as, incredibly, complex, and, difficult, to, specify, language, development, is, sometimes, separated, into, learning, of, phonology, systematic, organization, of, sounds, morphology, structure, of, linguistic, units, root, words, affixes, parts, of, speech, intonation, etc, syntax, rules, of, grammar, within, sentence, structure, semantics, study, of, meaning, and, discourse, or, pragmatics, relation, between, sentences, however, all, of, these, aspects, of, language, knowledge, which, were, originally, posited, by, the, linguist, noam, chomsky, to, be, autonomous, or, separate, are, now, recognized, to, interact, in, complex, ways, it, was, not, until, 1962, that, bilingualism, had, been, accepted, as, a, contributing, factor, to, cognitive, development, there, have, been, a, number, of, studies, showing, how, bilingualism, contributes, to, the, executive, function, of, the, brain, which, is, the, main, center, at, which, cognitive, development, happens, according, to, bialystok, in, bilingualism, and, the, development, of, executive, function, the, role, of, attention, children, who, are, bilingual, have, to, actively, filter, through, the, two, different, languages, to, select, the, one, they, need, to, use, which, in, turn, makes, the, development, stronger, in, that, center, while, working, as, a, student, of, edward, sapir, benjamin, lee, whorf, posited, that, a, person, s, thinking, depends, on, the, structure, and, content, of, their, social, group, s, language, per, whorf, language, determines, our, thoughts, and, perceptions, for, example, it, used, to, be, thought, that, the, greeks, who, wrote, left, to, right, thought, differently, than, egyptians, since, the, egyptians, wrote, right, to, left, whorf, s, theory, was, so, strict, that, he, believed, if, a, word, is, absent, in, a, language, then, the, individual, is, unaware, of, the, object, s, existence, this, theory, was, played, out, in, george, orwell, s, book, animal, farm, the, pig, leaders, slowly, eliminated, words, from, the, citizen, s, vocabulary, so, that, they, were, incapable, of, realizing, what, they, were, missing, the, whorfian, hypothesis, failed, to, recognize, that, people, can, still, be, aware, of, the, concept, or, item, even, though, they, lack, efficient, coding, to, quickly, identify, the, target, information, willard, van, orman, quine, argued, that, there, are, innate, conceptual, biases, that, enable, the, acquisition, of, language, concepts, and, beliefs, quine, s, theory, follows, nativist, philosophical, traditions, such, as, the, european, rationalist, philosophers, for, example, immanuel, kant, neo, piagetian, theories, of, cognitive, development, emphasized, the, role, of, information, processing, mechanisms, in, cognitive, development, such, as, attention, control, and, working, memory, they, suggested, that, progression, along, piagetian, stages, or, other, levels, of, cognitive, development, is, a, function, of, strengthening, of, control, mechanisms, and, is, within, the, stages, themselves, during, development, especially, the, first, few, years, of, life, children, show, interesting, patterns, of, neural, development, and, a, high, degree, of, neuroplasticity, neuroplasticity, as, explained, by, the, world, health, organization, can, be, summed, up, in, three, points, the, relation, of, brain, development, and, cognitive, development, is, extremely, complex, and, since, the, 1990s, has, been, a, growing, area, of, research, cognitive, development, and, motor, development, may, also, be, closely, interrelated, when, a, person, experiences, a, neurodevelopmental, disorder, and, their, cognitive, development, is, disturbed, we, often, see, adverse, effects, in, motor, development, as, well, cerebellum, which, is, the, part, of, brain, that, is, most, responsible, for, motor, skills, has, been, shown, to, have, significant, importance, in, cognitive, functions, in, the, same, way, that, prefrontal, cortex, has, important, duties, in, not, only, cognitive, abilities, but, also, development, of, motor, skills, to, support, this, there, is, evidence, of, close, co, activation, of, neocerebellum, and, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, in, functional, neuroimaging, as, well, as, abnormalities, seen, in, both, cerebellum, and, prefrontal, cortex, in, the, same, developmental, disorder, in, this, way, we, see, close, interrelation, of, motor, development, and, cognitive, development, and, they, cannot, operate, in, their, full, capacity, when, either, of, them, are, impaired, or, delayed, from, cultural, psychologists, view, minds, and, culture, shape, each, other, in, other, words, culture, can, influence, brain, structures, which, then, influence, our, interpretation, of, the, culture, these, examples, reveal, cultural, variations, in, neural, responses, behavioral, research, has, shown, that, one, s, strength, in, independent, tasks, which, are, focused, on, influencing, others, or, oneself, or, interdependent, tasks, tasks, where, one, changes, their, own, behavior, to, favor, others, differ, based, on, their, cultural, context, in, general, east, asian, cultures, are, more, interdependent, whereas, western, cultures, are, more, independent, hedden, et, al, assessed, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, responses, of, east, asians, and, americans, while, they, performed, independent, absolute, or, interdependent, relative, tasks, the, study, showed, that, participants, used, regions, of, the, brain, associated, with, attentional, control, when, they, had, to, perform, culturally, incongruent, tasks, in, other, words, neural, paths, used, for, the, same, task, were, different, for, americans, and, east, asians, new, studies, in, transcultural, neuroimaging, studies, have, demonstrated, that, one, s, cultural, background, can, influence, the, neural, activity, that, underlies, both, high, for, example, social, cognition, and, low, for, example, perception, level, cognitive, functions, studies, demonstrated, that, groups, that, come, from, different, cultures, or, that, have, been, exposed, to, culturally, different, stimuli, have, differences, in, neural, activity, for, example, differences, were, found, in, that, of, the, pre, motor, cortex, during, mental, calculation, and, that, of, the, vmpfc, during, trait, judgements, of, one, s, mother, from, people, with, different, cultural, backgrounds, in, conclusion, since, differences, were, found, in, both, high, level, and, low, level, cognition, one, can, assume, that, our, brain, s, activity, is, strongly, and, at, least, in, part, constitutionally, shaped, by, its, sociocultural, context, kobayashi, et, al, compared, american, english, monolingual, and, japanese, english, bilingual, children, s, brain, responses, in, understanding, others, intentions, through, false, belief, story, and, cartoon, tasks, they, found, universal, activation, of, the, region, bilateral, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, in, theory, of, mind, tasks, however, american, children, showed, greater, activity, in, the, left, inferior, frontal, gyrus, during, the, tasks, whereas, japanese, children, had, greater, activity, in, the, right, inferior, frontal, gyrus, during, the, japanese, theory, of, mind, tasks, in, conclusion, these, examples, suggest, that, the, brain, s, neural, activities, are, not, universal, but, are, culture, dependent, being, deaf, or, hard, of, hearing, has, been, noted, to, impact, cognitive, development, as, hearing, loss, impacts, social, development, language, acquisition, and, the, culture, reacts, to, a, deaf, child, cognitive, development, in, academic, achievement, reading, development, language, development, performance, on, standardized, measures, of, intelligence, visual, spatial, and, memory, skills, development, of, conceptual, skills, and, neuropsychological, function, are, dependent, upon, the, child, s, primary, language, of, communication, either, american, sign, language, or, english, as, well, as, if, the, child, is, able, to, communicate, and, use, the, communication, modality, as, a, language, there, is, some, research, pointing, to, deficits, in, development, of, theory, of, mind, in, children, who, are, deaf, and, hard, of, hearing, which, may, be, due, to, a, lack, of, early, conversational, experience, other, research, points, to, lower, scores, on, the, wechsler, intelligence, scale, for, children, especially, in, the, verbal, comprehension, index, due, differences, in, cultural, knowledge, acquisition, since, the, 2010s, there, has, been, an, increase, in, research, into, how, transgender, people, fit, into, cognitive, development, theory, at, the, earliest, transgender, children, can, begin, to, socially, transition, during, identity, exploration, in, 2015, kristina, olson, and, colleagues, studied, transgender, youth, in, comparison, to, their, cisgender, siblings, and, unrelated, cisgender, children, the, students, participated, in, the, iat, a, test, that, measures, how, one, may, identify, based, on, a, series, of, questions, related, to, memory, overall, it, determines, a, child, s, gender, preference, it, showed, that, the, transgender, children, s, results, correlated, with, their, desired, gender, the, behaviors, of, the, children, also, related, back, to, their, results, for, instance, the, transgender, boys, enjoyed, food, and, activities, typically, associated, and, enjoyed, by, cisgender, boys, the, article, reports, that, the, researchers, found, that, the, children, were, not, confused, deceptive, or, oppositional, of, their, gender, identity, and, responded, with, actions, that, are, typically, represented, by, their, gender, identity
