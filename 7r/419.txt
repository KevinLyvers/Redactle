every, consonant, has, a, hard, or, soft, counterpart, and, the, distinction, is, a, prominent, feature, of, the, language, another, important, aspect, is, the, reduction, of, unstressed, vowels, stress, which, is, often, unpredictable, is, not, normally, indicated, orthographically, though, an, optional, acute, accent, may, be, used, to, mark, stress, such, as, to, distinguish, between,

point, of, view, of, spoken, language, its, closest, relatives, are, ukrainian, belarusian, and, rusyn, the, other, three, languages, in, the, east, slavic, branch, in, many, places, in, eastern, and, southern, ukraine, and, throughout, belarus, these, languages, are, spoken, interchangeably, and, in, certain, areas, traditional, bilingualism, resulted, in, language, mixtures, such, as, surzhyk, in, eastern, ukraine, and, trasianka, in, belarus, an, east, slavic, old, novgorod, dialect, although, it, vanished, during, the, 15th, or, 16th, century, is, sometimes, considered, to, have, played, a, significant, role, in, the, formation, of, modern, russian, also, russian, has, notable, lexical, similarities, with, bulgarian, due, to, a, common, church, slavonic, influence, on, both, languages, but, because, of, later, interaction, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, bulgarian, grammar, differs, markedly, from, russian, over, the, course, of, centuries, the, vocabulary, and,

differences, and, for, a, while, prevented, the, emergence, of, a, standardized, national, language, the, formation, of, the, unified, and, centralized, russian, state, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, and, the, gradual, re, emergence, of, a, common, political, economic, and, cultural, space, created, the, need, for, a, common, standard, language, the, initial, impulse, for, standardization, came, from, the, government, bureaucracy, for, the, lack, of, a, reliable, tool, of, communication, in, administrative, legal, and, judicial, affairs, became, an, obvious, practical, problem, the, earliest, attempts, at, standardizing, russian, were, made, based, on, the, so, called, moscow, official, or, chancery, language, during, the, 15th, to, 17th, centuries, since, then, the, trend, of, language, policy, in, russia, has, been, standardization, in, both, the, restricted, sense, of, reducing, dialectical, barriers, between, ethnic, russians, and, the, broader, sense, of, expanding, the, use, of, russian, alongside, or, in, favour, of, other, languages, the, current, standard, form, of, russian, is, generally, regarded, as, the, modern, russian, literary, language, sovremenny, russky, literaturny, yazyk, it, arose, at, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, with, the, modernization, reforms, of, the, russian, state, under, the, rule, of, peter, the, great, and,

revolution, the, spoken, form, of, the, russian, language, was, that, of, the, nobility, and, the, urban, bourgeoisie, russian, peasants, the, great, majority, of, the, population, continued, to, speak, in, their, own, dialects, however, the, peasants, speech, was, never, systematically, studied, as, it, was, generally, regarded, by, philologists, as, simply, a, source, of, folklore, and, an, object, of, curiosity, this, was, acknowledged, by, the, noted, russian, dialectologist, nikolai, karinsky, who, toward, the, end, of, his, life, wrote, scholars, of, russian, dialects, mostly, studied, phonetics, and, morphology, some, scholars, and, collectors, compiled, local, dictionaries, we, have, almost, no, studies, of, lexical, material, or, the, syntax, of, russian, dialects, after, 1917, marxist, linguists, had, no, interest, in, the, multiplicity, of, peasant, dialects, and, regarded, their, language, as, a, relic, of, the, rapidly, disappearing, past, that, was, not, worthy, of, scholarly, attention, nakhimovsky, quotes, the, soviet, academicians, a, m, ivanov, and, l, p, yakubinsky, writing, in, 1930, the, language, of, peasants, has, a, motley, diversity,
