the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, french, d, claration, des, droits, de, l, homme, et, du, citoyen, de, 1789, set, by, france, s, national, constituent, assembly, in, 1789, is, a, human, civil, rights, document, from, the, french, revolution, inspired, by, enlightenment, philosophers, the, declaration, was, a, core, statement, of, the, values, of, the, french, revolution, and, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, development, of, popular, conceptions, of, individual, liberty, and, democracy, in, europe, and, worldwide, the, declaration, was, initially, drafted, by, marquis, de, lafayette, with, assistance, from, thomas, jefferson, but, the, majority, of, the, final, draft, came, from, abb, siey, s, influenced, by, the, doctrine, of, natural, right, human, rights, are, held, to, be, universal, valid, at, all, times, and, in, every, place, it, became, the, basis, for, a, nation, of, free, individuals, protected, equally, by, the, law, it, is, included, at, the, beginning, of, the, constitutions, of, both, the, fourth, french, republic, 1946, and, fifth, republic, 1958, and, is, considered, valid, as, constitutional, law, the, content, of, the, document, emerged, largely, from, the, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, lafayette, prepared, the, principal, drafts, in, consultation, with, his, close, friend, thomas, jefferson, in, august, 1789, abb, emmanuel, joseph, siey, s, and, honor, mirabeau, played, a, central, role, in, conceptualizing, and, drafting, the, final, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, the, last, article, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, the, citizen, was, adopted, on, the, 26, of, august, 1789, by, the, national, constituent, assembly, during, the, period, of, the, french, revolution, as, the, first, step, toward, writing, a, constitution, for, france, inspired, by, the, enlightenment, the, original, version, of, the, declaration, was, discussed, by, the, representatives, based, on, a, 24, article, draft, proposed, by, the, sixth, bureau, led, by, j, r, me, champion, de, cic, the, draft, was, later, modified, during, the, debates, a, second, and, lengthier, declaration, known, as, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, citizen, of, 1793, was, written, in, 1793, but, never, formally, adopted, the, concepts, in, the, declaration, come, from, the, philosophical, and, political, duties, of, the, enlightenment, such, as, individualism, the, social, contract, as, theorized, by, the, genevan, philosopher, rousseau, and, the, separation, of, powers, espoused, by, the, baron, de, montesquieu, as, can, be, seen, in, the, texts, the, french, declaration, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, political, philosophy, of, the, enlightenment, and, principles, of, human, rights, as, was, the, u, s, declaration, of, independence, which, preceded, it, 4, july, 1776, these, principles, were, shared, widely, throughout, european, society, rather, than, being, confined, to, a, small, elite, as, in, the, past, this, took, different, forms, such, as, english, coffeehouse, culture, and, extended, to, areas, colonised, by, europeans, particularly, british, north, america, contacts, between, diverse, groups, in, edinburgh, geneva, boston, amsterdam, paris, london, or, vienna, were, much, greater, than, often, appreciated, transnational, elites, who, shared, ideas, and, styles, were, not, new, what, changed, was, their, extent, and, the, numbers, involved, under, louis, xiv, versailles, was, the, centre, of, french, culture, fashion, and, political, power, improvements, in, education, and, literacy, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, meant, larger, audiences, for, newspapers, and, journals, with, masonic, lodges, coffee, houses, and, reading, clubs, providing, areas, where, people, could, debate, and, discuss, ideas, the, emergence, of, this, public, sphere, led, to, paris, replacing, versailles, as, the, cultural, and, intellectual, centre, leaving, the, court, isolated, and, less, able, to, influence, opinion, assisted, by, thomas, jefferson, then, american, ambassador, to, france, lafayette, prepared, a, draft, which, echoed, some, of, the, provisions, of, the, us, declaration, however, there, was, no, consensus, on, the, role, of, the, crown, and, until, this, question, was, settled, it, was, impossible, to, create, political, institutions, when, presented, to, the, legislative, committee, on, 11, july, it, was, rejected, by, pragmatists, such, as, jean, joseph, mounier, president, of, the, assembly, who, feared, creating, expectations, that, could, not, be, satisfied, conservatives, like, g, rard, de, lally, tollendal, wanted, a, bicameral, system, with, an, upper, house, appointed, by, the, king, who, would, have, the, right, of, veto, on, 10, september, the, majority, led, by, siey, s, and, talleyrand, rejected, this, in, favour, of, a, single, assembly, while, louis, xvi, retained, only, a, suspensive, veto, this, meant, he, could, delay, the, implementation, of, a, law, but, not, block, it, with, these, questions, settled, a, new, committee, was, convened, to, agree, on, a, constitution, the, most, controversial, remaining, issue, was, citizenship, itself, linked, to, the, debate, on, the, balance, between, individual, rights, and, obligations, ultimately, the, 1791, constitution, distinguished, between, active, citizens, who, held, political, rights, defined, as, french, males, over, the, age, of, 25, who, paid, direct, taxes, equal, to, three, days, labour, and, passive, citizens, who, were, restricted, to, civil, rights, as, a, result, it, was, never, fully, accepted, by, radicals, in, the, jacobin, club, after, editing, by, mirabeau, it, was, published, on, 26, august, as, a, statement, of, principle, the, final, draft, contained, provisions, then, considered, radical, in, any, european, society, let, alone, france, in, 1789, french, historian, georges, lefebvre, argues, that, combined, with, the, elimination, of, privilege, and, feudalism, it, highlighted, equality, in, a, way, the, american, declaration, of, independence, did, not, more, importantly, the, two, differed, in, intent, jefferson, saw, the, us, constitution, and, bill, of, rights, as, fixing, the, political, system, at, a, specific, point, in, time, claiming, they, contained, no, original, thought, but, expressed, the, american, mind, at, that, stage, the, 1791, french, constitution, was, viewed, as, a, starting, point, the, declaration, providing, an, aspirational, vision, a, key, difference, between, the, two, revolutions, attached, as, a, preamble, to, the, french, constitution, of, 1791, and, that, of, the, 1870, to, 1940, french, third, republic, it, was, incorporated, into, the, current, constitution, of, france, in, 1958, the, declaration, defined, a, single, set, of, individual, and, collective, rights, for, all, men, influenced, by, the, doctrine, of, natural, rights, these, rights, are, held, to, be, universal, and, valid, in, all, times, and, places, for, example, men, are, born, and, remain, free, and, equal, in, rights, social, distinctions, may, be, founded, only, upon, the, general, good, they, have, certain, natural, rights, to, property, to, liberty, and, to, life, according, to, this, theory, the, role, of, government, is, to, recognize, and, secure, these, rights, furthermore, the, government, should, be, carried, on, by, elected, representatives, when, it, was, written, the, rights, contained, in, the, declaration, were, only, awarded, to, men, furthermore, the, declaration, was, a, statement, of, vision, rather, than, reality, the, declaration, was, not, deeply, rooted, in, either, the, practice, of, the, west, or, even, france, at, the, time, the, declaration, emerged, in, the, late, 18th, century, out, of, war, and, revolution, it, encountered, opposition, as, democracy, and, individual, rights, were, frequently, regarded, as, synonymous, with, anarchy, and, subversion, this, declaration, embodies, ideals, and, aspirations, towards, which, france, pledged, to, struggle, in, the, future, the, declaration, is, introduced, by, a, preamble, describing, the, fundamental, characteristics, of, the, rights, which, are, qualified, as, natural, unalienable, and, sacred, and, simple, and, incontestable, principles, on, which, citizens, could, base, their, demands, in, the, second, article, the, natural, and, imprescriptible, rights, of, man, are, defined, as, liberty, property, security, and, resistance, to, oppression, it, called, for, the, destruction, of, aristocratic, privileges, by, proclaiming, an, end, to, feudalism, and, to, exemptions, from, taxation, freedom, and, equal, rights, for, all, men, and, access, to, public, office, based, on, talent, the, monarchy, was, restricted, and, all, citizens, had, the, right, to, participate, in, the, legislative, process, freedom, of, speech, and, press, were, declared, and, arbitrary, arrests, outlawed, the, declaration, also, asserted, the, principles, of, popular, sovereignty, in, contrast, to, the, divine, right, of, kings, that, characterized, the, french, monarchy, and, social, equality, among, citizens, all, the, citizens, being, equal, in, the, eyes, of, the, law, are, equally, admissible, to, all, public, dignities, places, and, employments, according, to, their, capacity, and, without, distinction, other, than, that, of, their, virtues, and, of, their, talents, eliminating, the, special, rights, of, the, nobility, and, clergy, article, i, men, are, born, and, remain, free, and, equal, in, rights, social, distinctions, may, be, founded, only, upon, the, general, good, article, ii, the, goal, of, any, political, association, is, the, conservation, of, the, natural, and, imprescriptible, rights, of, man, these, rights, are, liberty, property, safety, and, resistance, against, oppression, article, iii, the, principle, of, any, sovereignty, resides, essentially, in, the, nation, no, body, no, individual, may, exercise, any, authority, which, does, not, proceed, directly, from, the, nation, article, iv, liberty, consists, of, doing, anything, which, does, not, harm, others, thus, the, exercise, of, the, natural, rights, of, each, man, has, only, those, borders, which, assure, other, members, of, the, society, the, fruition, of, these, same, rights, these, borders, can, be, determined, only, by, the, law, article, v, the, law, has, the, right, to, forbid, only, actions, harmful, to, society, anything, which, is, not, forbidden, by, the, law, cannot, be, impeded, and, no, one, can, be, constrained, to, do, what, it, does, not, order, article, vi, the, law, is, the, expression, of, the, general, will, all, the, citizens, have, the, right, of, contributing, personally, or, through, their, representatives, to, its, formation, it, must, be, the, same, for, all, either, that, it, protects, or, that, it, punishes, all, the, citizens, being, equal, in, its, eyes, are, equally, admissible, to, all, public, dignities, places, and, employments, according, to, their, capacity, and, without, distinction, other, than, that, of, their, virtues, and, of, their, talents, article, vii, no, man, can, be, accused, arrested, nor, detained, but, in, the, cases, determined, by, the, law, and, according, to, the, forms, which, it, has, prescribed, those, who, solicit, dispatch, carry, out, or, cause, to, be, carried, out,

legally, applied, article, ix, any, man, being, presumed, innocent, until, he, is, declared, culpable, if, it, is, judged, indispensable, to, arrest, him, any, rigor, which, would, not, be, necessary, for, the, securing, of, his, person, must, be, severely, reprimanded, by, the, law, article, x, no, one, may, be, disquieted, for, his, opinions, even, religious, ones, provided, that, their, manifestation, does, not, trouble, the, public, order, established, by, the, law, article, xi, the, free, communication, of, thoughts, and, of, opinions, is, one, of, the, most, precious, rights, of,

rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, necessitates, a, public, force, this, force, is, thus, instituted, for, the, advantage, of, all, and, not, for, the, particular, utility, of, those, in, whom,

necessity, legally, noted, evidently, requires, it, and, under, the, condition, of, a, just, and, prior, indemnity, while, the, french, revolution, provided, rights, to, a, larger, portion, of, the, population, there, remained, a, distinction, between, those, who, obtained, the, political, rights, in, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, and, those, who, did, not, those, who, were, deemed, to, hold, these, political, rights, were, called, active, citizens, active, citizenship, was, granted, to, men, who, were, french, at, least, 25, years, old, paid, taxes, equal, to, three, days, work, and, could, not, be, defined, as, servants, this, meant, that, at, the, time, of, the, declaration, only, male, property, owners, held, these, rights, the, deputies, in, the, national, assembly, believed, that, only, those, who, held, tangible, interests, in, the, nation, could, make, informed, political, decisions, this, distinction, directly, affects, articles, 6, 12, 14, and, 15, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, as, each, of, these, rights, is, related, to, the, right, to, vote, and, to, participate, actively, in, the, government, with, the, decree, of, 29, october, 1789, the, term, active, citizen, became, embedded, in, french, politics, the, concept, of, passive, citizens, was, created, to, encompass, those, populations, excluded, from, political, rights, in, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, because, of, the, requirements, set, down, for, active, citizens, the, vote, was, granted, to, approximately, 4, 3, million, frenchmen, out, of, a, population, of, around, 29, million, these, omitted, groups, included, women, the, poor, enslaved, people, children, and, foreigners, as, the, general, assembly, voted, upon, these, measures, they, limited, the, rights, of, certain, groups, of, citizens, while, implementing, the, democratic, process, of, the, new, french, republic, 1792, 1804, this, legislation, passed, in, 1789, was, amended, by, the, creators, of, the, constitution, of, the, year, iii, to, eliminate, the, label, of, an, active, citizen, the, power, to, vote, was, then, however, to, be, granted, solely, to, substantial, property, owners, tensions, arose, between, active, and, passive, citizens, throughout, the, revolution, this, happened, when, passive, citizens, started, to, call, for, more, rights, or, openly, refused, to, listen, to, the, ideals, set, forth, by, active, citizens, women, in, particular, were, strong, passive, citizens, who, played, a, significant, role, in, the, revolution, olympe, de, gouges, penned, her, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, in, 1791, and, drew, attention, to, the, need, for, gender, equality, by, supporting, the, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, and, wishing, to, expand, them, to, women, she, represented, herself, as, a, revolutionary, citizen, madame, roland, also, established, herself, as, an, influential, figure, throughout, the, revolution, she, saw, women, of, the, french, revolution, as, holding, three, roles, inciting, revolutionary, action, formulating, policy, and, informing, others, of, revolutionary, events, by, working, with, men, as, opposed, to, working, apart, from, men, she, may, have, been, able, to, further, the, fight, for, revolutionary, women, as, players, in, the, french, revolution, women, occupied, a, significant, role, in, the, civic, sphere, by, forming, social, movements, and, participating, in, popular, clubs, allowing, them, societal, influence, despite, their, lack, of, direct, political, power, the, declaration, recognized, many, rights, as, belonging, to, citizens, who, could, only, be, male, this, was, despite, the, fact, that, after, the, march, on, versailles, on, 5, october, 1789, women, presented, the, women, s, petition, to, the, national, assembly, in, which, they, proposed, a, decree, giving, women, equal, rights, in, 1790, nicolas, de, condorcet, and, etta, palm, d, aelders, unsuccessfully, called, on, the, national, assembly, to, extend, civil, and, political, rights, to, women, condorcet, declared, that, he, who, votes, against, the, right, of, another, whatever, the, religion, color, or, sex, of, that, other, has, henceforth, abjured, his, own, the, french, revolution, did, not, lead, to, a, recognition, of, women, s, rights, and, this, prompted, olympe, de, gouges, to, publish, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, in, september, 1791, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, is, modeled, on, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, and, is, ironic, in, the, formulation, and, exposes, the, failure, of, the, french, revolution, which, had, been, devoted, to, equality, it, states, that, this, revolution, will, only, take, effect, when, all, women, become, fully, aware, of, their, deplorable, condition, and, of, the, rights, they, have, lost, in, society, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, follows, the, seventeen, articles, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, point, for, point, camille, naish, has, described, it, as, almost, a, parody, of, the, original, document, the, first, article, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, proclaims, that, men, are, born, and, remain, free, and, equal, in, rights, social, distinctions, may, be, based, only, on, common, utility, the, first, article, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, the, female, citizen, replied, woman, is, born, free, and, remains, equal, to, man, in, rights, social, distinctions, may, only, be, based, on, common, utility, de, gouges, also, draws, attention, to, the, fact, that, under, french, law, women, were, fully, punishable, yet, denied, equal, rights, declaring, women, have, the, right, to, mount, the, scaffold, they, must, also, have, the, right, to, mount, the, speaker, s, rostrum, the, declaration, did, not, revoke, the, institution, of, slavery, as, lobbied, for, by, jacques, pierre, brissot, s, les, amis, des, noirs, and, against, by, the, group, of, colonial, planters, called, the, club, massiac, because, they, met, at, the, h, tel, massiac, despite, the, lack, of, explicit, mention, of, slavery, in, the, declaration, slave, uprisings, in, saint, domingue, in, the, haitian, revolution, were, inspired, by, it, as, discussed, in, c, l, r, james, s, history, of, the, haitian, revolution, the, black, jacobins, in, louisiana, the, organizers, of, the, pointe, coup, e, slave, conspiracy, of, 1795, also, drew, information, from, the, declaration, deplorable, conditions, for, the, thousands, of, enslaved, people, in, saint, domingue, the, most, profitable, slave, colony, in, the, world, led, to, the, uprisings, known, as, the, first, successful, slave, revolt, in, the, new, world, free, persons, of, color, were, part, of, the, first, wave, of, revolt, but, later, formerly, enslaved, people, took, control, in, 1794, the, convention, was, dominated, by, the, jacobins, and, abolished, slavery, including, in, the, colonies, of, saint, domingue, and, guadeloupe, however, napoleon, reinstated, it, in, 1802, and, attempted, to, regain, control, of, saint, domingue, by, sending, in, thousands, of, troops, after, suffering, the, losses, of, two, thirds, of, the, men, many, to, yellow, fever, the, french, withdrew, from, saint, domingue, in, 1803, napoleon, gave, up, on, north, america, and, agreed, to, the, louisiana, purchase, by, the, united, states, in, 1804, the, leaders, of, saint, domingue, declared, it, an, independent, state, the, republic, of, haiti, the, second, republic, of, the, new, world, napoleon, abolished, the, slave, trade, in, 1815, slavery, in, france, was, finally, abolished, in, 1848, the, vast, amount, of, personal, freedom, given, to, citizens, by, the, document, created, a, situation, where, homosexuality, was, decriminalized, by, the, french, penal, code, of, 1791, which, covered, felonies, the, law, simply, failed, to, mention, sodomy, as, a, crime, and, thus, no, one, could, be, prosecuted, for, it, the, 1791, code, of, municipal, police, did, provide, misdemeanor, penalties, for, gross, public, indecency, which, the, police, could, use, to, punish, anyone, having, sex, in, public, places, or, otherwise, violating, social, norms, this, approach, to, punishing, homosexual, conduct, was, reiterated, in, the, french, penal, code, of, 1810
