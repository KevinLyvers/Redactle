washington, and, wisconsin, have, exercised, their, shared, sovereignty, to, offer, citizens, the, opportunity, to, write, propose, and, vote, on, referendums, other, states, and, the, federal, government, have, not, referendums, in, the, united, kingdom, are, rare, suffrage, continues, to, be, especially, restricted, on, the, basis, of, age, residency, and, citizenship, status, in, many, places, in, some, countries, additional, restrictions, exist, in, great, britain, and, the, united, states, a, felon, might, lose, the, right, to, vote, as, of, 2022, florida, felons, with, court,

european, union, citizens, or, to, certain, offices, or, questions, multiple, citizenship, typically, allows, to, vote, in, multiple, countries, historically, the, right, to, vote, was, more, restricted, for, example, by, gender, race, or, wealth, the, word, suffrage, comes, from, latin, suffragium, which, initially, meant, a, voting, tablet, a, ballot, a, vote, or, the, right, to, vote, suffragium, in, the, second, century, and, later, came, to, mean, political, patronage, influence, interest, or, support, and, sometimes, popular, acclaim, or, applause, by, the, fourth, century, the, word, was, used, for, an, intercession, asking, a, patron, for, their, influence, with, the, almighty, suffragium, was, used, in, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, with, connection, to, buying, influence, or, profiteering, from, appointing, to, office, and, eventually, the, word, referred, to, the, bribe, itself, william, smith, rejects, the, connection, of, suffragium, to, sub, under, fragor, crash, din, shouts, as, of, approval, related, to, frangere, to, break, eduard, wunder, writes, that, the, word, may, be, related, to, suffrago, signifying, an, ankle, bone, or, knuckle, bone, in, the, 17th, century, the, english, suffrage, regained, the, earlier, meaning, of, the, latin, suffragium, a, vote, or, the, right, to, vote, the, word, franchise, comes, from, the, french, word, franchir, which, means, to, free, other, common, uses, of, the, term, today, have, less, resemblance, to, the, original, meaning, as, they, are, associated, with, a, corporation, or, organization, selling, limited, autonomy, to, run, a, part, of, its, operation, such, as, a, sports, team, or, restaurant, this, modern, connotation, with, exclusivity, however, clashes, with, ideas, like, universal, suffrage, where, voting, is, a, right, for, all, not, a, privilege, for, a, select, few, universal, suffrage, would, be, achieved, when, all, have, the, right, to, vote, without, restriction, it, could, for, example, look, like, a, system, where, everyone, was, presumed, to, have, the, right, to, vote, unless, a, government, can, prove, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, the, need, to, revoke, voting, rights, the, trend, towards, universal, suffrage, has, progressed, in, some, democracies, by, eliminating, some, or, all, of, the, voting, restrictions, due, to, gender, race, religion, social, status, education, level, wealth, citizenship, ability, and, age, however, throughout, history, the, term, universal, suffrage, has, meant, different, things, with, the, different, assumptions, about, the, groups, that, were, or, were, not, deemed, desirable, voters, the, short, lived, corsican, republic, 1755, 1769, was, the, first, country, to, grant, limited, universal,

lack, of, any, representation, in, the, houses, of, parliament, historian, robert, poole, has, called, the, peterloo, massacre, one, of, the, defining, moments, of, its, age, the, eponymous, peterloo, film, featured, a, scene, of, women, suffragists, planning, their, contribution, to, the, protest, at, that, time, manchester, had, a, population, of, around, 140, 000, and, the, population, totals, of, greater, manchester, were, around, 490, 000, this, was, followed, by, other, experiments, in, the, paris, commune, of, 1871, and, the, island, republic, of, franceville, 1889, from, 1840, to, 1852, the, kingdom, of, hawai, i, granted, universal, suffrage, without, mention, of, sex, in, 1893, when, the, kingdom, of, hawai, i, was, overthrown, in, a, coup, new, zealand, was, the, only,

short, lived, suffrage, equity, was, drafted, into, provisions, of, the, state, of, new, jersey, s, first, 1776, constitution, which, extended, the, right, to, vote, to, unwed, female, landholders, and, black, land, owners, iv, that, all, inhabitants, of, this, colony, of, full, age, who, are, worth, fifty, pounds, proclamation, money, clear, estate, in, the, same, and, have, resided, within,

for, all, other, public, officers, that, shall, be, elected, by, the, people, of, the, county, at, large, new, jersey, 1776, however, the, document, did, not, specify, an, amendment, procedure, and, the, provision, was, subsequently, replaced, in, 1844, by, the, adoption, of, the, succeeding, constitution, which, reverted, to, all, white, male, suffrage, restrictions, although, the, kingdom, of, hawai, i, granted, female, suffrage, in, 1840, the, right, was, rescinded, in, 1852, limited, voting, rights, were, gained, by, some, women, in, sweden, britain, and, some, western, u, s, states, in,

a, woman, s, place, was, in, the, home, not, polls, political, cartoons, and, public, outrage, over, women, s, rights, increased, as, the, opposition, to, suffrage, worked, to, organize, legitimate, groups, campaigning, against, women, s, voting, rights, the, massachusetts, association, opposed, to, the, further, extension, of, suffrage, to, women, was, one, organization, that, came, out, of, the, 1880s, to, put, down, the, voting, efforts, much, anti, suffrage, propaganda, poked, fun, at, the, idea, of, women, in, politics, political, cartoons, displayed, the, most, sentiment, by,

turning, into, suffragettes, after, a, failure, in, life, such, as, not, being, married, equal, suffrage, is, sometimes, confused, with, universal, suffrage, although, the, meaning, of, the, former, is, the, removal, of, graded, votes, wherein, a, voter, could, possess, a, number, of, votes, in, accordance, with, income, wealth, or, social, status, also, known, as, censitary, suffrage, it, is,
