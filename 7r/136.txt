popular, culture, also, called, pop, culture, or, mass, culture, is, generally, recognized, by, members, of, a, society, as, a, set, of, practices, beliefs, artistic, output, also, known, as, popular, art, or, mass, art, and, objects, that, are, dominant, or, prevalent, in, a, society, at, a, given, point, in, time, popular, culture, also, encompasses, the, activities, and, feelings, produced, as, a, result, of, interaction, with, these, dominant, objects, the, primary, driving, forces, behind, popular, culture, especially, when, speaking, of, western, popular, cultures, are, the, media, mass, appeal, marketing, and, capitalism, and, it, is, produced, by, what, philosopher, theodor, adorno, refers, to, as, the, culture, industry, heavily, influenced, in, modern, times, by, mass, media, this, collection, of, ideas, permeates, the, everyday, lives, of, people, in, a, given, society, therefore, popular, culture, has, a, way, of, influencing, an, individual, s, attitudes, towards, certain, topics, however, there, are, various, ways, to, define, pop, culture, because, of, this, popular, culture, is, something, that, can, be, defined, in, a, variety, of, conflicting, ways, by, different, people, across, different, contexts, it, is, generally, viewed, in, contrast, to, other, forms, of, culture, such, as, folk, culture, working, class, culture, or, high, culture, and, also, from, different, academic, perspectives, such, as, psychoanalysis, structuralism, postmodernism, and, more, the, common, pop, culture, categories, are, entertainment, such, as, film, music, television, literature, and, video, games, sports, news, as, in, people, places, in, the, news, politics, fashion, technology, and, slang, in, the, past, folk, culture, functioned, analogously, to, the, popular, culture, of, the, masses, and, of, the, nations, the, phrase, popular, culture, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, or, earlier, traditionally, popular, culture, was, associated, with, poor, education, and, with, the, lower, classes, as, opposed, to, the, official, culture, and, higher, education, of, the, upper, classes, with, the, rise, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, britain, experienced, social, changes, that, resulted, in, increased, literacy, rates, and, with, the, rise, of, capitalism, and, industrialization, people, began, to, spend, more, money, on, entertainment, such, as, commercialised, public, houses, and, sports, reading, also, gained, traction, labeling, penny, dreadfuls, the, victorian, equivalent, of, video, games, the, guardian, in, 2016, described, penny, fiction, as, britain, s, first, taste, of, mass, produced, popular, culture, for, the, young, a, growing, consumer, culture, and, an, increased, capacity, for, travel, via, the, newly, invented, railway, the, first, public, railway, stockton, and, darlington, railway, opened, in, north, east, england, in, 1825, created, both, a, market, for, cheap, popular, literature, and, the, ability, for, its, distribution, on, a, large, scale, the, first, penny, serials, were, published, in, the, 1830s, to, meet, the, growing, demand, the, stress, on, the, distinction, from, official, culture, became, more, pronounced, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, usage, that, became, established, by, the, interbellum, period, from, the, end, of, world, war, ii, following, major, cultural, and, social, changes, brought, by, mass, media, innovations, the, meaning, of, popular, culture, began, to, overlap, with, the, connotations, of, mass, culture, media, culture, image, culture, consumer, culture, and, culture, for, mass, consumption, the, abbreviated, form, pop, for, popular, as, in, pop, music, dates, from, the, late, 1950s, although, the, terms, pop, and, popular, are, in, some, cases, used, interchangeably, and, their, meaning, partially, overlap, the, term, pop, is, narrower, pop, is, specific, to, something, containing, qualities, of, mass, appeal, while, popular, refers, to, what, has, gained, popularity, regardless, of, its, style, according, to, author, john, storey, there, are, various, definitions, of, popular, culture, the, quantitative, definition, of, culture, has, the, problem, that, too, much, high, culture, e, g, television, dramatizations, of, jane, austen, is, also, popular, pop, culture, is, also, defined, as, the, culture, that, is, leftover, when, we, have, decided, what, high, culture, is, however, many, works, straddle, the, boundaries, e, g, william, shakespeare, and, charles, dickens, leo, tolstoy, and, george, orwell, a, third, definition, equates, pop, culture, with, mass, culture, and, ideas, this, is, seen, as, a, commercial, culture, mass, produced, for, mass, consumption, by, mass, media, from, a, western, european, perspective, this, may, be, compared, to, american, culture, alternatively, pop, culture, can, be, defined, as, an, authentic, culture, of, the, people, but, this, can, be, problematic, as, there, are, many, ways, of, defining, the, people, storey, argued, that, there, is, a, political, dimension, to, popular, culture, neo, gramscian, hegemony, theory, sees, popular, culture, as, a, site, of, struggle, between, the, resistance, of, subordinate, groups, in, society, and, the, forces, of, incorporation, operating, in, the, interests, of, dominant, groups, in, society, a, postmodernist, approach, to, popular, culture, would, no, longer, recognize, the, distinction, between, high, and, popular, culture, storey, claims, that, popular, culture, emerged, from, the, urbanization, of, the, industrial, revolution, studies, of, shakespeare, by, weimann, barber, or, bristol, for, example, locate, much, of, the, characteristic, vitality, of, his, drama, in, its, participation, in, renaissance, popular, culture, while, contemporary, practitioners, like, dario, fo, and, john, mcgrath, use, popular, culture, in, its, gramscian, sense, that, includes, ancient, folk, traditions, the, commedia, dell, arte, for, example, popular, culture, is, constantly, evolving, and, occurs, uniquely, in, place, and, time, it, forms, currents, and, eddies, and, represents, a, complex, of, mutually, interdependent, perspectives, and, values, that, influence, society, and, its, institutions, in, various, ways, for, example, certain, currents, of, pop, culture, may, originate, from, or, diverge, into, a, subculture, representing, perspectives, with, which, the, mainstream, popular, culture, has, only, limited, familiarity, items, of, popular, culture, most, typically, appeal, to, a, broad, spectrum, of, the, public, important, contemporary, contributions, to, understanding, what, popular, culture, means, have, been, given, by, the, german, researcher, ronald, daus, who, studies, the, impact, of, extra, european, cultures, in, north, america, asia, and, especially, in, latin, america, within, the, realm, of, popular, culture, there, exists, an, organizational, culture, from, its, beginning, popular, culture, has, revolved, around, classes, in, society, and, the, push, back, between, them, within, popular, culture, there, are, two, levels, that, have, emerged, high, and, low, high, culture, can, be, described, as, art, and, works, considered, of, superior, value, historically, aesthetically, and, socially, low, culture, is, regarded, by, some, as, that, of, the, lower, classes, historically, adaptations, based, on, traditional, folklore, provide, a, source, of, popular, culture, this, early, layer, of, cultural, mainstream, still, persists, today, in, a, form, separate, from, mass, produced, popular, culture, propagating, by, word, of, mouth, rather, than, via, mass, media, e, g, in, the, form, of, jokes, or, urban, legends, with, the, widespread, use, of, the, internet, from, the, 1990s, the, distinction, between, mass, media, and, word, of, mouth, has, become, blurred, although, the, folkloric, element, of, popular, culture, engages, heavily, with, the, commercial, element, communities, amongst, the, public, have, their, own, tastes, and, they, may, not, always, embrace, every, cultural, or, subcultural, item, sold, moreover, certain, beliefs, and, opinions, about, the, products, of, commercial, culture, may, spread, by, word, of, mouth, and, become, modified, in, the, process, and, in, the, same, manner, that, folklore, evolves, popular, culture, in, the, west, has, been, critiqued, for, being, a, system, of, commercialism, that, privileges, products, selected, and, mass, marketed, by, the, upper, class, capitalist, elite, such, criticisms, are, most, notable, in, many, marxist, theorists, such, as, herbert, marcuse, theodor, adorno, max, horkheimer, bell, hooks, antonio, gramsci, guy, debord, fredric, jameson, terry, eagleton, as, well, as, certain, postmodern, philosophers, such, as, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, who, has, written, about, the, commercialisation, of, information, under, capitalism, and, jean, baudrillard, as, well, as, others, the, most, influential, critiques, of, popular, culture, came, from, marxist, theorists, of, the, frankfurt, school, during, the, twentieth, century, theodor, adorno, and, max, horkheimer, analyzed, the, dangers, of, the, culture, industry, in, their, influential, work, the, dialectic, of, enlightenment, by, drawing, upon, the, works, of, kant, marx, nietzsche, and, others, capitalist, popular, culture, as, adorno, argued, was, not, an, authentic, culture, of, the, people, but, a, system, of, homogenous, and, standardized, products, manufactured, in, the, service, of, capitalist, domination, by, the, elite, the, consumer, demand, for, hollywood, films, pop, tunes, and, consumable, books, is, influenced, by, capitalist, industries, like, hollywood, and, the, elite, who, decide, which, commodities, are, to, be, promoted, in, the, media, including, television, and, print, journalism, adorno, wrote, the, industry, bows, to, the, vote, it, has, itself, rigged, it, is, the, elite, who, commodify, products, in, accordance, with, their, narrow, ideological, values, and, criteria, and, adorno, argues, that, the, audience, becomes, accustomed, to, these, formulaic, conventions, making, intellectual, contemplation, impossible, adorno, s, work, has, had, a, considerable, influence, on, culture, studies, philosophy, and, the, new, left, writing, in, the, new, yorker, in, 2014, music, critic, alex, ross, argued, that, adorno, s, work, has, a, renewed, importance, in, the, digital, age, the, pop, hegemony, is, all, but, complete, its, superstars, dominating, the, media, and, wielding, the, economic, might, of, tycoons, culture, appears, more, monolithic, than, ever, with, a, few, gigantic, corporations, google, apple, facebook, amazon, presiding, over, unprecedented, monopolies, there, is, much, scholarship, on, how, western, entertainment, industries, strengthen, transnational, capitalism, and, reinforce, western, cultural, dominance, hence, rather, than, being, a, local, culture, commercial, entertainment, is, artificially, reinforced, by, transnational, media, corporations, globalized, pop, culture, can, contribute, to, the, homogenization, of, cultural, identities, erasing, or, diluting, diverse, local, traditions, and, practices, in, favor, of, standardized, marketable, forms, of, entertainment, and, consumption, jack, zipes, a, professor, of, german, and, literature, critiqued, the, mass, commercialization, and, corporate, hegemony, behind, the, harry, potter, franchise, he, argued, that, the, commodities, of, the, culture, industry, are, popular, because, they, are, homogenous, and, obey, standard, conventions, the, media, then, influences, the, tastes, of, children, in, his, analysis, of, harry, potter, s, global, brand, zipes, wrote, it, must, conform, to, the, standards, of, exception, set, by, the, mass, media, and, promoted, by, the, culture, industry, in, general, to, be, a, phenomenon, means, that, a, person, or, commodity, must, conform, to, the, hegemonic, groups, that, determine, what, makes, up, a, phenomenon, according, to, john, m, mackenzie, many, products, of, popular, culture, have, been, designed, to, promote, imperialist, ideologies, and, to, glorify, the, british, upper, classes, rather, than, present, a, democratic, view, of, the, world, although, there, are, many, films, which, do, not, contain, such, propaganda, there, have, been, many, films, that, promote, racism, and, militarist, imperialism, bell, hooks, an, influential, feminist, argues, that, commercial, commodities, and, celebrities, cannot, be, symbols, of, progressiveness, when, they, collaborate, with, imperialist, capitalism, and, promote, ideals, of, beauty, hooks, uses, beyonc, as, an, example, of, a, commodity, reinforced, by, capitalist, corporations, complicit, in, imperialism, and, patriarchy, edward, s, herman, and, noam, chomsky, critiqued, the, mass, media, in, their, 1988, work, manufacturing, consent, the, political, economy, of, the, mass, media, they, argue, that, mass, media, is, controlled, by, a, powerful, hegemonic, elite, who, are, motivated, by, their, own, interests, that, determine, and, manipulate, what, information, is, present, in, the, mainstream, the, mass, media, is, therefore, a, system, of, propaganda, in, sum, a, propaganda, approach, to, media, coverage, suggests, a, systematic, and, highly, political, dichotomization, in, news, coverage, based, on, serviceability, to, important, domestic, power, interests, this, should, be, observable, in, dichotomized, choices, of, story, and, in, the, volume, and, quality, of, coverage, such, dichotomization, in, the, mass, media, is, massive, and, systematic, not, only, are, choices, for, publicity, and, suppression, comprehensible, in, terms, of, system, advantage, but, the, modes, of, handling, favored, and, inconvenient, materials, placement, tone, context, fullness, of, treatment, differ, in, ways, that, serve, political, ends, according, to, the, postmodern, sociologist, jean, baudrillard, the, individual, is, trained, into, the, duty, of, seeking, the, relentless, maximization, of, pleasure, lest, he, or, she, become, asocial, therefore, enjoyment, and, fun, become, indistinguishable, from, the, need, to, consume, whereas, the, frankfurt, school, believed, consumers, were, passive, baudrillard, argued, that, consumers, were, trained, to, consume, products, in, the, form, of, active, labor, in, order, to, achieve, upward, social, mobility, thus, consumers, under, capitalism, are, trained, to, purchase, products, such, as, pop, albums, and, consumable, fiction, in, order, to, signal, their, devotion, to, social, trends, fashions, and, subcultures, although, the, consumption, may, arise, from, an, active, choice, the, choice, is, still, the, consequence, of, a, social, conditioning, that, the, individual, is, unconscious, of, baudrillard, says, one, is, permanently, governed, by, a, code, whose, rules, and, meaning, constraints, like, those, of, language, are, for, the, most, part, beyond, the, grasp, of, individuals, jean, baudrillard, argued, that, the, vague, conception, public, opinion, is, a, subjective, and, inaccurate, illusion, for, it, attributes, a, sovereignty, to, consumers, that, they, do, not, really, have, in, baudrillard, s, understanding, the, products, of, capitalist, popular, culture, can, only, give, the, illusion, of, rebellion, since, they, are, still, produced, by, a, system, controlled, by, the, powerful, baudrillard, stated, in, an, interview, critiquing, the, content, and, production, of, the, matrix, the, matrix, paints, the, picture, of, a, monopolistic, superpower, like, we, see, today, and, then, collaborates, in, its, refraction, basically, its, dissemination, on, a, world, scale, is, complicit, with, the, film, itself, on, this, point, it, is, worth, recalling, marshall, mcluhan, the, medium, is, the, message, the, message, of, the, matrix, is, its, own, diffusion, by, an, uncontrollable, and, proliferating, contamination, with, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, in, the, sixteenth, century, mass, produced, cheap, books, pamphlets, and, periodicals, became, widely, available, to, the, public, with, this, the, transmission, of, common, knowledge, and, ideas, was, possible, in, the, 1890s, nikola, tesla, and, guglielmo, marconi, created, the, radiotelegraph, allowing, for, the, modern, radio, to, be, born, this, led, to, the, radio, being, able, to, influence, a, more, listened, to, culture, with, individuals, being, able, to, feel, like, they, have, a, more, direct, impact, this, radio, culture, is, vital, because, it, was, imperative, to, advertising, and, it, introduced, the, commercial, films, and, cinema, are, highly, influential, to, popular, culture, as, films, as, an, art, form, are, what, people, seem, to, respond, to, the, most, with, moving, pictures, being, first, captured, by, eadweard, muybridge, in, 1877, films, have, evolved, into, elements, that, can, be, cast, into, different, digital, formats, spreading, to, different, cultures, the, impact, of, films, and, cinema, are, most, evident, when, analyzing, in, the, search, of, what, the, films, aim, to, portray, films, are, used, to, seek, acceptance, and, understanding, of, many, subjects, because, of, the, influence, the, films, carry, an, example, of, an, early, representation, of, this, can, be, seen, in, casablanca, 1942, the, film, introduced, war, subjects, to, the, public, after, the, united, states, entered, world, war, ii, and, it, meant, to, increase, pro, war, sentiment, for, the, allies, films, are, a, known, massive, influencer, to, popular, culture, yet, not, all, films, create, a, movement, that, contributes, enough, to, be, part, of, the, popular, culture, that, starts, movements, the, content, must, resonate, to, most, of, the, public, so, the, knowledge, in, the, material, connects, with, the, majority, popular, culture, is, a, set, of, beliefs, in, trends, and, entail, to, change, a, person, s, set, of, ideologies, and, create, social, transformation, the, beliefs, are, still, a, trend, that, change, more, rapidly, in, the, modern, age, that, carries, a, continuation, of, outpouring, media, and, more, specifically, films, the, trend, does, not, last, but, it, also, carries, a, different, effect, based, on, individuals, that, can, be, grouped, to, generalized, groups, based, on, age, and, education, the, creation, of, culture, by, films, is, seen, in, fandoms, religions, ideologies, and, movements, the, culture, of, film, is, more, evident, through, social, media, social, media, is, an, instant, source, of, feedback, and, creates, discussion, on, films, a, repeating, event, that, has, been, set, in, modern, culture, within, the, trend, setting, phase, is, the, creation, of, movements, in, social, media, platforms, to, defend, a, featured, subject, on, a, film, popular, culture, or, mass, culture,

and, applaudable, changes, over, the, years, culminating, in, the, production, of, masterpieces, unimaginable, in, the, past, decades, this, dynamic, trend, has, compelled, renowned, clothing, lines,

functionality, as, well, as, to, be, made, in, the, cheapest, way, possible, this, was, due, to, collective, preparation, efforts, through, the, conservation, of, materials, this, trend, can, also, be, seen, throughout, the, 1930s, or, the, great, depression, era, of, history, due, to, the, state, of, the, economy, clothing, yet, again, faced, fundamental, changes, in, shape, and, function, the,

have, a, great, effect, on, fashion, as, consumers, will, be, looking, to, make, more, of, an, investment, in, the, items, that, they, purchase, rather, than, participating, in, a, constant, cycle, of, buying, sustainability, is, something, that, designers, are, actively, pursuing, as, well, connolly, a, british, menswear, brand, is, just, one, example, of, the, many, who, are, challenging, designers, and, stylists, to, revamp, and, upcycle, pieces, of, clothing, from, past, collections, further, the, past, few, decades, have, seen, the, reintroduction, of, old, designs, which, have, been, revitalized, and, improvised, to, fit, the, current, market, needs, additionally, celebrities, and, influencers, are, at, the, forefront, of, setting, fashion, trends, through, various, platforms, clothing, will, continue, to, act, as, an, area, for, personal, expression, no, matter, the, trends, constantly, shaped, by, the, world, around, us, pop, culture, has, had, a, lasting,
