destination, is, usually, located, near, the, mountains, in, a, valley, and, most, families, already, have, fixed, winter, locations, their, winter, locations, have, shelter, for, animals, and, are, not, used, by, other, families, while, they, are, out, in, the, summer, they, move, to, a, more, open, area, in, which, the, animals, can, graze, most, nomads, usually, move, within, the, same, region, and, do, not, travel, very, far, since, they, usually, circle, around, a, large, area, communities, form, and, families, generally, know, where, the, other, ones, are, often, families, do, not, have, the, resources, to, move, from, one, province, to, another, unless, they, are, moving, out, of, the, area, permanently, a, family, can, move, on, its, own, or, with, others, if, it, moves,

usually, do, not, have, large, populations, one, nomadic, society, the, mongols, gave, rise, to, the, largest, land, empire, in, history, the, mongols, originally, consisted, of, loosely, organized, nomadic, tribes, in, mongolia, manchuria, and, siberia, in, the, late, 12th, century, genghis, khan, united, them, and, other, nomadic, tribes, to, found, the, mongol, empire, which, eventually, stretched, the, length, of, asia, the, nomadic, way, of, life, has, become, increasingly, rare, many, countries, have, converted, pastures, into, cropland, and, forced, nomadic, peoples, into, permanent, settlements, modern, forms, of, nomadic, peoples, are, variously, referred, to, as, shiftless, gypsies, rootless, cosmopolitans, hunter, gatherers, refugees, and, urban, homeless, or, street, people, depending, on, their, individual, circumstances, these, terms, may, be, used, in, a, derogatory, sense, according, to, g, rard, chaliand, terrorism, originated, in, nomad, warrior, cultures, he, points, to, machiavelli, s, classification, of, war, into, two, types, which, chaliand, interprets, as, describing, a, difference, between, warfare, in, sedentary, and, nomadic, societies, there, are, two, different, kinds, of, war, the, one, springs, from, the, ambition, of, princes, or, republics, that, seek, to, extend, their, empire, such, were, the, wars, of, alexander, the, great, and, those, of, the, romans, and, those, which, two, hostile, powers, carry, on, against, each, other, these, wars, are, dangerous, but, never, go, so, far, as, to, drive, all, its, inhabitants, out, of, a, province, because, the, conqueror, is, satisfied, with, the, submission, of, the, people, the, other, kind, of, war, is, when, an, entire, people, constrained, by, famine, or, war, leave, their, country, with, their, families, for, the, purpose, of, seeking, a, new, home, in, a, new, country, not, for, the, purpose, of, subjecting, it, to, their, dominion, as, in, the, first, case, but, with, the, intention, of, taking, absolute, possession, of, it, themselves, and, driving, out, or, killing, its, original, inhabitants, primary, historical, sources, for, nomadic, steppe, style, warfare, are, found, in, many, languages, chinese, persian, polish, russian, classical, greek, armenian, latin, and, arabic, these, sources, concern, both, the, true, steppe, nomads, mongols, huns, magyars, and, scythians, and, also, the, semi, settled, people, like, turks, crimean, tatars, and, russians, who, retained, or, in, some, cases, adopted, the, nomadic, form, of, warfare, hunter, gatherers, also, known, as, foragers, move, from, campsite, to, campsite, following, game, and, wild, fruits, and, vegetables, hunting, and, gathering, describes, early, peoples, subsistence, living, style, following, the, development, of, agriculture, most, hunter, gatherers, were, eventually, either, displaced, or, converted, to, farming, or, pastoralist, groups, only, a, few, contemporary, societies, such, as, the, pygmies, the, hadza, people, and, some, uncontacted, tribes, in, the, amazon, rainforest, are, classified, as, hunter, gatherers, some, of, these, societies, supplement, sometimes, extensively, their, foraging, activity, with, farming, or, animal, husbandry, pastoral, nomads, are, nomads, moving, between, pastures, nomadic, pastoralism, is, thought, to, have, developed, in, three, stages, that, accompanied, population, growth, and, an, increase, in, the, complexity, of, social, organization, karim, sadr, has, proposed, the, following, stages, the, pastoralists, are, sedentary, to, a, certain, area, as, they, move, between, the, permanent, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, or, dry, and, wet, season, pastures, for, their, livestock, the, nomads, moved, depending, on, the, availability, of, resources, nomadic, pastoralism, seems, to, have, developed, first, as, a, part, of, the, secondary, products, revolution, proposed, by, andrew, sherratt, in, which, early, pre, pottery, neolithic, cultures, that, had, used, animals, as, live, meat, on, the, hoof, also, began, using, animals, for, their, secondary, products, for, example, milk, and, its, associated, dairy, products, wool, and, other, animal, hair, hides, and, consequently, leather, manure, for, fuel, and, fertilizer, and, traction, the, first, nomadic, pastoral, society, developed, in, the, period, from, 8, 500, to, 6, 500, bce, in, the, area, of, the, southern, levant, there, during, a, period, of, increasing, aridity, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, ppnb, cultures, in, the, sinai, were, replaced, by, a, nomadic, pastoral, pottery, using, culture, which, seems, to, have, been, a, cultural, fusion, between, them, and, a, newly, arrived, mesolithic, people, from, egypt, the, harifian, culture, adopting, their, nomadic, hunting, lifestyle, to, the, raising, of, stock, this, lifestyle, quickly, developed, into, what, jaris, yurins, has, called, the, circum, arabian, nomadic, pastoral, techno, complex, and, is, possibly, associated, with, the, appearance, of, semitic, languages, in, the, region, of, the, ancient, near, east, the, rapid, spread, of, such, nomadic, pastoralism, was, typical, of, such, later, developments, as, of, the, yamnaya, culture, of, the, horse, and, cattle, nomads, of, the, eurasian, steppe, c, 3300, 2600, bce, and, of, the, mongol, spread, in, the, later, middle, ages, yamnaya, steppe, pastoralists, from, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, who, were, among, the, first, to, master, horseback, riding, played, a, key, role, in, indo, european, migrations, and, in, the, spread, of, indo, european, languages, across, eurasia, trekboers, in, southern, africa, adopted, nomadism, from, the, 17th, century, some, elements, of, gaucho, culture, in, colonial, south, america, also, re, invented, nomadic, lifestyles, one, of, the, results, of, the, break, up, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, subsequent, political, independence, and, economic, collapse, of, its, central, asian, republics, has, been, the, resurgence, of, pastoral, nomadism, taking, the, kyrgyz, people, as, a, representative, example, nomadism, was, the, centre, of, their, economy, before, russian, colonization, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, when, they, were, settled, into, agricultural, villages, the, population, became, increasingly, urbanized, after, world, war, ii, but, some, people, still, take, their, herds, of, horses, and, cows, to, high, pastures, jailoo, every, summer, continuing, a, pattern, of, transhumance, since, the, 1990s, as, the, cash, economy, shrank, unemployed, relatives, were, reabsorbed, into, family, farms, and, the, importance, of, this, form, of, nomadism, has, increased, the, symbols, of, nomadism, specifically, the, crown, of, the, grey, felt, tent, known, as, the, yurt, appears, on, the, national, flag, emphasizing, the, central, importance, of, nomadism, in, the, genesis, of, the, modern, nation, of, kyrgyzstan, from, 1920, to, 2008, the, population, of, nomadic, pastoral, tribes, slowly, decreased, from, over, a, quarter, of, iran, s, population, tribal, pastures, were, nationalized, during, the, 1960s, the, national, commission, of, unesco, registered, the, population, of, iran, at, 21, million, in, 1963, of, whom, two, million, 9, 5, were, nomads, although, the, nomadic, population, of, iran, has, dramatically, decreased, in, the, 20th, century, iran, still, has, one, of, the, largest, nomadic, populations, in, the, world, an, estimated, 1, 5, million, in, a, country, of, about, 70, million, in, kazakhstan, where, the, major, agricultural, activity, was, nomadic, herding, forced, collectivization, under, joseph, stalin, s, rule, met, with, massive, resistance, and, major, losses, and, confiscation, of, livestock, livestock, in, kazakhstan, fell, from, 7, million, cattle, to, 1, 6, million, and, from, 22, million, sheep, to, 1, 7, million, the, resulting, famine, of, 1931, 1934, caused, some, 1, 5, million, deaths, this, represents, more, than, 40, of, the, total, kazakh, population, at, that, time, in, the, 1950s, as, well, as, the, 1960s, large, numbers, of, bedouin, throughout, the, middle, east, started, to, leave, the, traditional, nomadic, life, to, settle, in, the, cities, of, the, middle, east, especially, as, home, ranges, have, shrunk, and, population, levels, have, grown, government, policies, in, egypt, and, israel, oil, production, in, libya, and, the, persian, gulf, as, well, as, a, desire, for, improved, standards, of, living, effectively, led, most, bedouin, to, become, settled, citizens, of, various, nations, rather, than, stateless, nomadic, herders, a, century, ago, nomadic, bedouin, still, made, up, some, 10, of, the, total, arab, population, today, they, account, for, some, 1, of, the, total, at, independence, in, 1960, mauritania, was, essentially, a, nomadic, society, the, great, sahel, droughts, of, the, early, 1970s, caused, massive, problems, in, a, country, where, 85, of, its, inhabitants, were, nomadic, herders, today, only, 15, remain, nomads, as, many, as, 2, million, nomadic, kuchis, wandered, over, afghanistan, in, the, years, before, the, soviet, invasion, and, most, experts, agreed, that, by, 2000, the, number, had, fallen, dramatically, perhaps, by, half, a, severe, drought, had, destroyed, 80, of, the, livestock, in, some, areas, niger, experienced, a, serious, food, crisis, in, 2005, following, erratic, rainfall, and, desert, locust, invasions, nomads, such, as, the, tuareg, and, fulani, who, make, up, about, 20, of, niger, s, 12, 9, million, population, had, been, so, badly, hit, by, the, niger, food, crisis, that, their, already, fragile, way, of, life, is, at, risk, nomads, in, mali, were, also, affected, the, fulani, of, west, africa, are, the, world, s, largest, nomadic, group, pala, nomads, living, in, western, tibet, have, a, diet, that, is, unusual, in, that, they, consume, very, few, vegetables, and, no, fruit, the, main, staple, of, their, diet, is, tsampa, and, they, drink, tibetan, style, butter, tea, pala, will, eat, heartier, foods, in, the, winter, months, to, help, keep, warm, some, of, the, customary, restrictions, they, explain, as, cultural, saying, only, that, drokha, do, not, eat, certain, foods, even, some, that, may, be, naturally, abundant, though, they, live, near, sources, of, fish, and, fowl, these, do, not, play, a, significant, role, in, their, diet, and, they, do, not, eat, carnivorous, animals, rabbits, or, the, wild, asses, that, are, abundant, in, the, environs, classifying, the, latter, as, horse, due, to, their, cloven, hooves, some, families, do, not, eat, until, after, the, morning, milking, while, others, may, have, a, light, meal, with, butter, tea, and, tsampa, in, the, afternoon, after, the, morning, milking, the, families, gather, and, share, a, communal, meal, of, tea, tsampa, and, sometimes, yogurt, during, winter, months, the, meal, is, more, substantial, and, includes, meat, herders, will, eat, before, leaving, the, camp, and, most, do, not, eat, again, until, they, return, to, camp, for, the, evening, meal, the, typical, evening, meal, may, include, thin, stew, with, tsampa, animal, fat, and, dried, radish, winter, stew, would,

a, valued, skill, in, their, culture, ann, marie, kroll, lerner, states, that, the, pastoral, nomads, were, viewed, as, invading, destructive, and, altogether, antithetical, to, civilizing, sedentary, societies, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, according, to, lerner, they, are, rarely, accredited, as, a, civilizing, force, allan, hill, and, sara, randall, observe, that, western, authors, have, looked, for, romance, and, mystery, as, well, as, the, repository, of, laudable, characteristics, believed, lost, in, the, west, such, as, independence, stoicism, in, the, face, of, physical, adversity, and, a, strong, sense, of, loyalty, to, family, and, to, tribe, in, nomadic, pastoralist, societies, hill, and, randall, observe, that, nomadic, pastoralists, are, stereotypically, seen, by, the, settled, populace, in, africa, and, middle, east, as, aimless, wanderers, immoral, promiscuous, and, disease, ridden, peoples, according, to, hill, and, randall, both, of, these, perceptions, misrepresent, the, reality, peripatetic, minorities, are, mobile, populations, moving, among, settled, populations, offering, a, craft, or, trade, each, existing, community,
