royal, monopolies, and, other, trade, barriers, instead, promoting, free, trade, and, marketization, philosopher, john, locke, is, often, credited, with, founding, liberalism, as, a, distinct, tradition, based, on, the, social, contract, arguing, that, each, man, has, a, natural, right, to, life, liberty, and, property, and, governments, must, not, violate, these, rights, while, the, british, liberal, tradition, has, emphasized, expanding, democracy, french, liberalism, has, emphasized, rejecting, authoritarianism, and, is, linked, to, nation, building, leaders, in, the, british, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, the, american, revolution, of, 1776, and, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, used, liberal, philosophy, to, justify, the, armed, overthrow, of, royal, sovereignty, the, 19th, century, saw, liberal, governments, established, in, europe, and, south, america, and, it, was, well, established, alongside, republicanism, in, the, united, states, in, victorian, britain, it,

with, other, factors, helped, to, create, a, sense, of, crisis, within, islam, which, continues, to, this, day, leading, to, islamic, revivalism, before, 1920, the, main, ideological, opponents, of, liberalism, were, communism, conservatism, and, socialism, liberalism, then, faced, major, ideological, challenges, from, fascism, and, marxism, leninism, as, new, opponents, during, the, 20th, century, liberal, ideas, spread, even, further, especially, in, western, europe, as, liberal, democracies, found, themselves, as, the, winners, in, both, world, wars, and, the, cold, war, liberals, sought, and, established, a, constitutional, order, that, prized, important, individual, freedoms, such, as, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, association, an, independent, judiciary, and, public, trial, by, jury, and, the, abolition, of, aristocratic, privileges, later, waves, of, modern, liberal, thought, and, struggle, were, strongly, influenced, by, the, need, to, expand, civil, rights, liberals, have, advocated, gender, and, racial, equality, in, their, drive, to, promote, civil, rights, and, global, civil, rights, movements, in, the, 20th, century, achieved, several, objectives, towards, both, goals, other, goals, often, accepted, by, liberals, include, universal, suffrage, and, universal, access, to, education, in, europe, and, north, america, the, establishment, of, social, liberalism, often, called, simply, liberalism, in, the, united, states, became, a, key, component, in, expanding, the, welfare, state, today, liberal, parties, continue, to, wield, power,

man, the, word, s, early, connection, with, the, classical, education, of, a, medieval, university, soon, gave, way, to, a, proliferation, of, different, denotations, and, connotations, liberal, could, refer, to, free, in, bestowing, as, early, as, 1387, made, without, stint, in, 1433, freely, permitted, in, 1530, and, free, from, restraint, often, as, a, pejorative, remark, in, the, 16th, and, the, 17th, centuries, in, the, 16th, century, kingdom, of, england, liberal, could, have, positive, or, negative, attributes, in, referring, to, someone, s, generosity, or, indiscretion, in,

politicised, term, for, parties, and, movements, worldwide, over, time, the, meaning, of, liberalism, began, to, diverge, in, different, parts, of, the, world, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, in, the, united, states, liberalism, is, associated, with, the, welfare, state, policies, of, the, new, deal, programme, of, the, democratic, administration, of, pres, franklin, d, roosevelt, whereas, in, europe, it, is, more, commonly, associated, with, a, commitment, to, limited, government, and, laissez, faire, economic, policies, consequently, the, ideas, of, individualism, and, laissez, faire, economics, previously, associated, with, classical, liberalism, are, key, components, of, modern, american, conservatism, and, movement, conservatism, and, became, the, basis, for, the, emerging, school, of, modern, american, libertarian, thought, in, this, american, context, liberal, is, often, used, as, a, pejorative, yellow, is, the, political, colour, most, commonly, associated, with, liberalism, in, europe, and, latin, america, liberalism, means, a, moderate, form, of, classical, liberalism, and, includes, both, conservative, liberalism, centre, right,

sense, liberalism, both, as, a, political, current, and, an, intellectual, tradition, is, mostly, a, modern, phenomenon, that, started, in, the, 17th, century, although, some, liberal, philosophical, ideas, had, precursors, in, classical, antiquity, and, imperial, china, the, roman, emperor, marcus, aurelius, praised, the, idea, of, a, polity, administered, with, regard, to, equal, rights, and, equal, freedom, of, speech, and, the, idea, of, a, kingly, government, which, respects, most, of, all, the, freedom, of, the, governed, scholars, have, also, recognised, many, principles, familiar, to, contemporary, liberals, in, the, works, of, several, sophists, and, the, funeral, oration, by, pericles, liberal, philosophy, is, the, culmination, of, an, extensive, intellectual, tradition, that, has, examined, and, popularized, some, of, the, modern, world, s, most, important, and, controversial, principles, its, immense, scholarly, output, has, been, characterized, as, containing, richness, and, diversity, but, that, diversity, often, has, meant, that, liberalism, comes, in, different, formulations, and, presents, a, challenge, to, anyone, looking, for, a, clear, definition, although, all, liberal, doctrines, possess, a, common, heritage, scholars, frequently, assume, that, those, doctrines, contain, separate, and, often, contradictory, streams, of, thought, the, objectives, of, liberal, theorists, and, philosophers, have, differed, across, various, times, cultures, and, continents, the, diversity, of, liberalism, can, be, gleaned, from, the, numerous, qualifiers, that, liberal, thinkers, and, movements, have, attached, to, the, term, liberalism, including, classical, egalitarian, economic, social, the, welfare, state, ethical, humanist, deontological, perfectionist, democratic, and, institutional, to, name, a, few, despite, these, variations, liberal, thought, does, exhibit, a, few, definite, and, fundamental, conceptions, political, philosopher, john, gray, identified, the, common, strands, in, liberal, thought, as, individualist, egalitarian, meliorist, and, universalist, the, individualist, element, avers, the, ethical, primacy, of, the, human, being, against, the, pressures, of, social, collectivism, the, egalitarian, element, assigns, the, same, moral, worth, and, status, to, all, individuals, the, meliorist, element, asserts, that, successive, generations, can, improve, their, sociopolitical, arrangements, and, the, universalist, element, affirms, the, moral, unity, of, the, human, species, and, marginalises, local, cultural, differences, the, meliorist, element, has, been, the, subject, of, much, controversy, defended, by, thinkers, such, as, immanuel, kant, who, believed, in, human, progress, while, suffering, criticism, by, thinkers, such, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, instead, believed, that, human, attempts, to, improve, themselves, through, social, cooperation, would, fail, the, liberal, philosophical, tradition, has, searched, for, validation, and, justification, through, several, intellectual, projects, the, moral, and, political, suppositions, of, liberalism, have, been, based, on, traditions, such, as, natural, rights, and, utilitarian, theory, although, sometimes, liberals, even, request, support, from, scientific, and, religious, circles, through, all, these, strands, and, traditions, scholars, have, identified, the, following, major, common, facets, of, liberal, thought, enlightenment, philosophers, are, given, credit, for, shaping, liberal, ideas, these, ideas, were, first, drawn, together, and, systematized, as, a, distinct, ideology, by, the, english, philosopher, john, locke, generally, regarded, as, the, father, of, modern, liberalism, thomas, hobbes, attempted, to, determine, the, purpose, and, the, justification, of, governing, authority, in, post, civil, war, england, employing, the, idea, of, a, state, of, nature, a, hypothetical, war, like, scenario, prior, to, the, state, he, constructed, the, idea, of, a, social, contract, that, individuals, enter, into, to, guarantee, their, security, and, in, so, doing, form, the, state, concluding, that, only, an, absolute, sovereign, would, be, fully, able, to, sustain, such, security, hobbes, had, developed, the, concept, of, the, social, contract, according, to, which, individuals, in, the, anarchic, and, brutal, state, of, nature, came, together, and, voluntarily, ceded, some, of, their, rights, to, an, established, state, authority, which, would, create, laws, to, regulate, social, interactions, to, mitigate, or, mediate, conflicts, and, enforce, justice, whereas, hobbes, advocated, a, strong, monarchical, commonwealth, the, leviathan, locke, developed, the, then, radical, notion, that, government, acquires, consent, from, the, governed, which, has, to, be, constantly, present, for, the, government, to, remain, legitimate, while, adopting, hobbes, s, idea, of, a, state, of, nature, and, social, contract, locke, nevertheless, argued, that, when, the, monarch, becomes, a, tyrant, it, violates, the, social, contract, which, protects, life, liberty, and, property, as, a, natural, right, he, concluded, that, the, people, have, a, right, to, overthrow, a, tyrant, by, placing, the, security, of, life, liberty, and, property, as, the, supreme, value, of, law, and, authority, locke, formulated, the, basis, of, liberalism, based, on, social, contract, theory, to, these, early, enlightenment, thinkers, securing, the, essential, amenities, of, life, liberty, and, private, property, required, forming, a, sovereign, authority, with, universal, jurisdiction, his, influential, two, treatises, 1690, the, foundational, text, of, liberal, ideology, outlined, his, major, ideas, once, humans, moved, out, of, their, natural, state, and, formed, societies, locke, argued, that, which, begins, and, actually, constitutes, any, political, society, is, nothing, but, the, consent, of, any, number, of, freemen, capable, of, a, majority, to, unite, and, incorporate, into, such, a, society, and, this, is, that, and, that, only, which, did, or, could, give, beginning, to, any, lawful, government, in, the, world, 170, the, stringent, insistence, that, lawful, government, did, not, have, a, supernatural, basis, was, a, sharp, break, with, the, dominant, theories, of, governance, which, advocated, the, divine, right, of, kings, and, echoed, the, earlier, thought, of, aristotle, dr, john, zvesper, described, this, new, thinking, in, the, liberal, understanding, there, are, no, citizens, within, the, regime, who, can, claim, to, rule, by, natural, or, supernatural, right, without, the, consent, of, the, governed, locke, had, other, intellectual, opponents, besides, hobbes, in, the, first, treatise, locke, aimed, his, arguments, first, and, foremost, at, one, of, the, doyens, of, 17th, century, english, conservative, philosophy, robert, filmer, filmer, s, patriarcha, 1680, argued, for, the, divine, right, of, kings, by, appealing, to, biblical, teaching, claiming, that, the, authority, granted, to, adam, by, god, gave, successors, of, adam, in, the, male, line, of, descent, a, right, of, dominion, over, all, other, humans, and, creatures, in, the, world, however, locke, disagreed, so, thoroughly, and, obsessively, with, filmer, that, the, first, treatise, is, almost, a, sentence, by, sentence, refutation, of, patriarcha, reinforcing, his, respect, for, consensus, locke, argued, that, conjugal, society, is, made, up, by, a, voluntary, compact, between, men, and, women, locke, maintained, that, the, grant, of, dominion, in, genesis, was, not, to, men, over, women, as, filmer, believed, but, to, humans, over, animals, locke, was, not, a, feminist, by, modern, standards, but, the, first, major, liberal, thinker, in, history, accomplished, an, equally, major, task, on, the, road, to, making, the, world, more, pluralistic, integrating, women, into, social, theory, locke, also, originated, the, concept, of, the, separation, of, church, and, state, based, on, the, social, contract, principle, locke, argued, that, the, government, lacked, authority, in, the, realm, of, individual, conscience, as, this, was, something, rational, people, could, not, cede, to, the, government, for, it, or, others, to, control, for, locke, this, created, a, natural, right, to, the, liberty, of, conscience, which, he, argued, must, remain, protected, from, any, government, authority, in, his, letters, concerning, toleration, he, also, formulated, a, general, defence, for, religious, toleration, three, arguments, are, central, locke, was, also, influenced, by, the, liberal, ideas, of, presbyterian, politician, and, poet, john, milton, who, was, a, staunch, advocate, of, freedom, in, all, its, forms, milton, argued, for, disestablishment, as, the, only, effective, way, of, achieving, broad, toleration, rather, than, force, a, man, s, conscience, the, government, should, recognise, the, persuasive, force, of, the, gospel, as, assistant, to, oliver, cromwell, milton, also, drafted, a, constitution, of, the, independents, agreement, of, the, people, 1647, that, strongly, stressed, the, equality, of, all, humans, as, a, consequence, of, democratic, tendencies, in, his, areopagitica, milton, provided, one, of, the, first, arguments, for, the, importance, of, freedom, of, speech, the, liberty, to, know, to, utter, and, to, argue, freely, according, to, conscience, above, all, liberties, his, central, argument, was, that, the, individual, could, use, reason, to, distinguish, right, from, wrong, to, exercise, this, right, everyone, must, have, unlimited, access, to, the, ideas, of, his, fellow, men, in, a, free, and, open, encounter, which, will, allow, good, arguments, to, prevail, in, a, natural, state, of, affairs, liberals, argued, humans, were, driven, by, the, instincts, of, survival, and, self, preservation, and, the, only, way, to, escape, from, such, a, dangerous, existence, was, to, form, a, common, and, supreme, power, capable, of, arbitrating, between, competing, human, desires, this, power, could, be, formed, in, the, framework, of, a, civil, society, that, allows, individuals, to, make, a, voluntary, social, contract, with, the, sovereign, authority, transferring, their, natural, rights, to, that, authority, in, return, for, the, protection, of, life, liberty, and, property, these, early, liberals, often, disagreed, about, the, most, appropriate, form, of, government, but, all, believed, that, liberty, was, natural, and, its, restriction, needed, strong, justification, liberals, generally, believed, in, limited, government, although, several, liberal, philosophers, decried, government, outright, with, thomas, paine, writing, government, even, in, its, best, state, is, a, necessary, evil, as, part, of, the, project, to, limit, the, powers, of, government, liberal, theorists, such, as, james, madison, and, montesquieu, conceived, the, notion, of, separation, of, powers, a, system, designed, to, equally, distribute, governmental, authority, among, the, executive, legislative, and, judicial, branches, governments, had, to, realise, liberals, maintained, that, legitimate, government, only, exists, with, the, consent, of, the, governed, so, poor, and, improper, governance, gave, the, people, the, authority, to, overthrow, the, ruling, order, through, all, possible, means, even, through, outright, violence, and, revolution, if, needed, contemporary, liberals, heavily, influenced, by, social, liberalism, have, supported, limited, constitutional, government, while, advocating, for, state, services, and, provisions, to, ensure, equal, rights, modern, liberals, claim, that, formal, or, official, guarantees, of, individual, rights, are, irrelevant, when, individuals, lack, the, material, means, to, benefit, from, those, rights, and, call, for, a, greater, role, for, government, in, the, administration, of, economic, affairs, early, liberals, also, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, separation, of, church, and, state, as, heirs, of, the, enlightenment, liberals, believed, that, any, given, social, and, political, order, emanated, from, human, interactions, not, from, divine, will, many, liberals, were, openly, hostile, to, religious, belief, but, most, concentrated, their, opposition, to, the, union, of, religious, and, political, authority, arguing, that, faith, could, prosper, independently, without, official, sponsorship, or, administration, by, the, state, beyond, identifying, a, clear, role, for, government, in, modern, society, liberals, have, also, argued, over, the, meaning, and, nature, of, the, most, important, principle, in, liberal, philosophy, liberty, from, the, 17th, century, until, the, 19th, century, liberals, from, adam, smith, to, john, stuart, mill, conceptualised, liberty, as, the, absence, of, interference, from, government, and, other, individuals, claiming, that, all, people, should, have, the, freedom, to, develop, their, unique, abilities, and, capacities, without, being, sabotaged, by, others, mill, s, on, liberty, 1859, one, of, the, classic, texts, in, liberal, philosophy, proclaimed, the, only, freedom, which, deserves, the, name, is, that, of, pursuing, our, own, good, in, our, own, way, support, for, laissez, faire, capitalism, is, often, associated, with, this, principle, with, friedrich, hayek, arguing, in, the, road, to, serfdom, 1944, that, reliance, on, free, markets, would, preclude, totalitarian, control, by, the, state, the, development, into, maturity, of, modern, classical, in, contrast, to, ancient, liberalism, took, place, before, and, soon, after, the, french, revolution, one, of, the, historic, centres, of, this, development, was, at, coppet, castle, near, geneva, where, the, eponymous, coppet, group, gathered, under, the, aegis, of, the, exiled, writer, and, salonni, re, madame, de, sta, l, in, the, period, between, the, establishment, of, napoleon, s, first, empire, 1804, and, the, bourbon, restoration, of, 1814, 1815, the, unprecedented, concentration, of, european, thinkers, who, met, there, was, to, have, a, considerable, influence, on, the, development, of, nineteenth, century, liberalism, and, incidentally, romanticism, they, included, wilhelm, von, humboldt, jean, de, sismondi, charles, victor, de, bonstetten, prosper, de, barante, henry, brougham, lord, byron, alphonse, de, lamartine, sir, james, mackintosh, juliette, r, camier, and, august, wilhelm, schlegel, among, them, was, also, one, of, the, first, thinkers, to, go, by, the, name, of, liberal, the, edinburgh, university, educated, swiss, protestant, benjamin, constant, who, looked, to, the, united, kingdom, rather, than, to, ancient, rome, for, a, practical, model, of, freedom, in, a, large, mercantile, society, he, distinguished, between, the, liberty, of, the, ancients, and, the, liberty, of, the, moderns, the, liberty, of, the, ancients, was, a, participatory, republican, liberty, which, gave, the, citizens, the, right, to, influence, politics, directly, through, debates, and, votes, in, the, public, assembly, in, order, to, support, this, degree, of, participation, citizenship, was, a, burdensome, moral, obligation, requiring, a, considerable, investment, of, time, and, energy, generally, this, required, a, sub, group, of, slaves, to, do, much, of, the, productive, work, leaving, citizens, free, to, deliberate, on, public, affairs, ancient, liberty, was, also, limited, to, relatively, small, and, homogenous, male, societies, where, they, could, congregate, in, one, place, to, transact, public, affairs, in, contrast, the, liberty, of, the, moderns, was, based, on, the, possession, of, civil, liberties, the, rule, of, law, and, freedom, from, excessive, state, interference, direct, participation, would, be, limited, a, necessary, consequence, of, the, size, of, modern, states, and, the, inevitable, result, of, creating, a, mercantile, society, where, there, were, no, slaves, but, almost, everybody, had, to, earn, a, living, through, work, instead, the, voters, would, elect, representatives, who, would, deliberate, in, parliament, on, the, people, s, behalf, and, would, save, citizens, from, daily, political, involvement, the, importance, of, constant, s, writings, on, the, liberty, of, the, ancients, and, that, of, the, moderns, has, informed, the, understanding, of, liberalism, as, has, his, critique, of, the, french, revolution, the, british, philosopher, and, historian, of, ideas, sir, isaiah, berlin, has, pointed, to, the, debt, owed, to, constant, liberalism, in, britain, was, based, on, core, concepts, such, as, classical, economics, free, trade, laissez, faire, government, with, minimal, intervention, and, taxation, and, a, balanced, budget, classical, liberals, were, committed, to, individualism, liberty, and, equal, rights, writers, such, as, john, bright, and, richard, cobden, opposed, aristocratic, privilege, and, property, which, they, saw, as, an, impediment, to, developing, a, class, of, yeoman, farmers, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, new, conception, of, liberty, entered, the, liberal, intellectual, arena, this, new, kind, of, liberty, became, known, as, positive, liberty, to, distinguish, it, from, the, prior, negative, version, and, it, was, first, developed, by, british, philosopher, t, h, green, green, rejected, the, idea, that, humans, were, driven, solely, by, self, interest, emphasising, instead, the, complex, circumstances, involved, in, the, evolution, of, our, moral, character, 54, 55, in, a, very, profound, step, for, the, future, of, modern, liberalism, he, also, tasked, society, and, political, institutions, with, the, enhancement, of, individual, freedom, and, identity, and, the, development, of, moral, character, will, and, reason, and, the, state, to, create, the, conditions, that, allow, for, the, above, allowing, genuine, choice, 54, 55, foreshadowing, the, new, liberty, as, the, freedom, to, act, rather, than, to, avoid, suffering, from, the, acts, of, others, green, wrote, the, following, if, it, were, ever, reasonable, to, wish, that, the, usage, of, words, had, been, other, than, it, has, been, one, might, be, inclined, to, wish, that, the, term, freedom, had, been, confined, to, the, power, to, do, what, one, wills, rather, than, previous, liberal, conceptions, viewing, society, as, populated, by, selfish, individuals, green, viewed, society, as, an, organic, whole, in, which, all, individuals, have, a, duty, to, promote, the, common, good, 55, his, ideas, spread, rapidly, and, were, developed, by, other, thinkers, such, as, leonard, trelawny, hobhouse, and, john, a, hobson, in, a, few, years, this, new, liberalism, had, become, the, essential, social, and, political, programme, of, the, liberal, party, in, britain, 58, and, it, would, encircle, much, of, the, world, in, the, 20th, century, in, addition, to, examining, negative, and, positive, liberty, liberals, have, tried, to, understand, the, proper, relationship, between, liberty, and, democracy, as, they, struggled, to, expand, suffrage, rights, liberals, increasingly, understood, that, people, left, out, of, the, democratic, decision, making, process, were, liable, to, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, a, concept, explained, in, mill, s, on, liberty, and, democracy, in, america, 1835, by, alexis, de, tocqueville, as, a, response, liberals, began, demanding, proper, safeguards, to, thwart, majorities, in, their, attempts, at, suppressing, the, rights, of, minorities, besides, liberty, liberals, have, developed, several, other, principles, important, to, the, construction, of, their, philosophical, structure, such, as, equality, pluralism, and, tolerance, highlighting, the, confusion, over, the, first, principle, voltaire, commented, equality, is, at, once, the, most, natural, and, at, times, the, most, chimeral, of, things, all, forms, of, liberalism, assume, in, some, basic, sense, that, individuals, are, equal, in, maintaining, that, people, are, naturally, equal, liberals, assume, they, all, possess, the, same, right, to, liberty, in, other, words, no, one, is, inherently, entitled, to, enjoy, the, benefits, of, liberal, society, more, than, anyone, else, and, all, people, are, equal, subjects, before, the, law, beyond, this, basic, conception, liberal, theorists, diverge, in, their, understanding, of, equality, american, philosopher, john, rawls, emphasised, the, need, to, ensure, equality, under, the, law, and, the, equal, distribution, of, material, resources, that, individuals, required, to, develop, their, aspirations, in, life, libertarian, thinker, robert, nozick, disagreed, with, rawls, championing, the, former, version, of, lockean, equality, to, contribute, to, the, development, of, liberty, liberals, also, have, promoted, concepts, like, pluralism, and, tolerance, by, pluralism, liberals, refer, to, the, proliferation, of, opinions, and, beliefs, that, characterise, a, stable, social, order, unlike, many, of, their, competitors, and, predecessors, liberals, do, not, seek, conformity, and, homogeneity, in, how, people, think, their, efforts, have, been, geared, towards, establishing, a, governing, framework, that, harmonises, and, minimises, conflicting, views, but, still, allows, those, views, to, exist, and, flourish, for, liberal, philosophy, pluralism, leads, easily, to, toleration, since, individuals, will, hold, diverging, viewpoints, liberals, argue, they, ought, to, uphold, and, respect, the, right, of, one, another, to, disagree, from, the, liberal, perspective, toleration, was, initially, connected, to, religious, toleration, with, baruch, spinoza, condemning, the, stupidity, of, religious, persecution, and, ideological, wars, toleration, also, played, a, central, role, in, the, ideas, of, kant, and, john, stuart, mill, both, thinkers, believed, that, society, would, contain, different, conceptions, of, a, good, ethical, life, and, that, people, should, be, allowed, to, make, their, own, choices, without, interference, from, the, state, or, other, individuals, adam, smith, s, the, wealth, of, nations, published, in, 1776, followed, by, the, french, liberal, economist, jean, baptiste, say, s, treatise, on, political, economy, published, in, 1803, and, expanded, in, 1830, with, practical, applications, were, to, provide, most, of, the, ideas, of, economics, until, the, publication, of, john, stuart, mill, s, principles, in, 1848, 63, 68, smith, addressed, the, motivation, for, economic, activity, the, causes, of, prices, and, wealth, distribution, and, the, policies, the, state, should, follow, to, maximise, wealth, 64, smith, wrote, that, as, long, as, supply, demand, prices, and, competition, were, left, free, of, government, regulation, the, pursuit, of, material, self, interest, rather, than, altruism, maximises, society, s, wealth, through, profit, driven, production, of, goods, and, services, an, invisible, hand, directed, individuals, and, firms, to, work, toward, the, nation, s, good, as, an, unintended, consequence, of, efforts, to, maximise, their, gain, this, provided, a, moral, justification, for, accumulating, wealth, which, some, had, previously, viewed, as, sinful, 64, smith, assumed, that, workers, could, be, paid, as, low, as, was, necessary, for, their, survival, which, david, ricardo, and, thomas, robert, malthus, later, transformed, into, the, iron, law, of, wages, 65, his, main, emphasis, was, on, the, benefit, of, free, internal, and, international, trade, which, he, thought, could, increase, wealth, through, specialisation, in, production, 66, he, also, opposed, restrictive, trade, preferences, state, grants, of, monopolies, and, employers, organisations, and, trade, unions, 67, government, should, be, limited, to, defence, public, works, and, the, administration, of, justice, financed, by, taxes, based, on, income, 68, smith, was, one, of, the, progenitors, of, the, idea, which, was, long, central, to, classical, liberalism, and, has, resurfaced, in, the, globalisation, literature, of, the, later, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, that, free, trade, promotes, peace, smith, s, economics, was, carried, into, practice, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, lowering, of, tariffs, in, the, 1820s, the, repeal, of, the, poor, relief, act, that, had, restricted, the, mobility, of, labour, in, 1834, and, the, end, of, the, rule, of, the, east, india, company, over, india, in, 1858, 69, in, his, treatise, trait, d, conomie, politique, say, states, that, any, production, process, requires, effort, knowledge, and, the, application, of, the, entrepreneur, he, sees, entrepreneurs, as, intermediaries, in, the, production, process, who, combine, productive, factors, such, as, land, capital, and, labour, to, meet, the, consumers, demands, as, a, result, they, play, a, central, role, in, the, economy, through, their, coordinating, function, he, also, highlights, qualities, essential, for, successful, entrepreneurship, and, focuses, on, judgement, in, that, they, have, continued, to, assess, market, needs, and, the, means, to, meet, them, this, requires, an, unerring, market, sense, say, views, entrepreneurial, income, primarily, as, the, high, revenue, paid, in, compensation, for, their, skills, and, expert, knowledge, he, does, so, by, contrasting, the, enterprise, and, supply, of, capital, functions, distinguishing, the, entrepreneur, s, earnings, on, the, one, hand, and, the, remuneration, of, capital, on, the, other, this, differentiates, his, theory, from, that, of, joseph, schumpeter, who, describes, entrepreneurial, rent, as, short, term, profits, which, compensate, for, high, risk, schumpeterian, rent, say, himself, also, refers, to, risk, and, uncertainty, along, with, innovation, without, analysing, them, in, detail, say, is, also, credited, with, say, s, law, or, the, law, of, markets, which, may, be, summarised, as, aggregate, supply, creates, its, own, aggregate, demand, and, supply, creates, its, own, demand, or, supply, constitutes, its, own, demand, and, inherent, in, supply, is, the, need, for, its, own, consumption, the, related, phrase, supply, creates, its, own, demand, was, coined, by, john, maynard, keynes, who, criticized, say, s, separate, formulations, as, amounting, to, the, same, thing, some, advocates, of, say, s, law, who, disagree, with, keynes, have, claimed, that, say, s, law, can, be, summarized, more, accurately, as, production, precedes, consumption, and, that, what, say, is, stating, is, that, for, consumption, to, happen, one, must, produce, something, of, value, so, that, it, can, be, traded, for, money, or, barter, for, consumption, later, say, argues, products, are, paid, for, with, products, 1803, p, 153, or, a, glut, occurs, only, when, too, much, resource, is, applied, to, making, one, product, and, not, enough, to, another, 1803, pp, 178, 179, related, reasoning, appears, in, the, work, of, john, stuart, mill, and, earlier, in, that, of, his, scottish, classical, economist, father, james, mill, 1808, mill, senior, restates, say, s, law, in, 1808, production, of, commodities, creates, and, is, the, one, and, universal, cause, which, creates, a, market, for, the, commodities, produced, in, addition, to, smith, s, and, say, s, legacies, thomas, malthus, theories, of, population, and, david, ricardo, s, iron, law, of, wages, became, central, doctrines, of, classical, economics, 76, meanwhile, jean, baptiste, say, challenged, smith, s, labour, theory, of, value, believing, that, prices, were, determined, by, utility, and, also, emphasised, the, critical, role, of, the, entrepreneur, in, the, economy, however, neither, of, those, observations, became, accepted, by, british, economists, at, the, time, malthus, wrote, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, in, 1798, 71, 72, becoming, a, major, influence, on, classical, liberalism, malthus, claimed, that, population, growth, would, outstrip, food, production, because, the, population, grew, geometrically, while, food, production, grew, arithmetically, as, people, were, provided, with, food, they, would, reproduce, until, their, growth, outstripped, the, food, supply, nature, would, then, provide, a, check, to, growth, in, the, forms, of, vice, and, misery, no, gains, in, income, could, prevent, this, and, any, welfare, for, the, poor, would, be, self, defeating, the, poor, were, in, fact, responsible, for, their, problems, which, could, have, been, avoided, through, self, restraint, 72, several, liberals, including, adam, smith, and, richard, cobden, argued, that, the, free, exchange, of, goods, between, nations, would, lead, to, world, peace, smith, argued, that, as, societies, progressed, the, spoils, of, war, would, rise, but, the, costs, of, war, would, rise, further, making, war, difficult, and, costly, for, industrialised, nations, cobden, believed, that, military, expenditures, worsened, the, state, s, welfare, and, benefited, a, small, but, concentrated, elite, minority, combining, his, little, englander, beliefs, with, opposition, to, the, economic, restrictions, of, mercantilist, policies, to, cobden, and, many, classical, liberals, those, who, advocated, peace, must, also, advocate, free, markets, utilitarianism, was, seen, as, a, political, justification, for, implementing, economic, liberalism, by, british, governments, an, idea, dominating, economic, policy, from, the, 1840s, although, utilitarianism, prompted, legislative, and, administrative, reform, and, john, stuart, mill, s, later, writings, foreshadowed, the, welfare, state, it, was, mainly, used, as, a, premise, for, a, laissez, faire, approach, 32, the, central, concept, of, utilitarianism, developed, by, jeremy, bentham, was, that, public, policy, should, seek, to, provide, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, while, this, could, be, interpreted, as, a, justification, for, state, action, to, reduce, poverty, it, was, used, by, classical, liberals, to, justify, inaction, with, the, argument, that, the, net, benefit, to, all, individuals, would, be, higher, 76, his, philosophy, proved, highly, influential, on, government, policy, and, led, to, increased, benthamite, attempts, at, government, social, control, including, robert, peel, s, metropolitan, police, prison, reforms, the, workhouses, and, asylums, for, the, mentally, ill, during, the, great, depression, the, english, economist, john, maynard, keynes, 1883, 1946, gave, the, definitive, liberal, response, to, the, economic, crisis, keynes, had, been, brought, up, as, a, classical, liberal, but, especially, after, world, war, i, became, increasingly, a, welfare, or, social, liberal, a, prolific, writer, among, many, other, works, he, had, begun, a, theoretical, work, examining, the, relationship, between, unemployment, money, and, prices, back, in, the, 1920s, keynes, was, deeply, critical, of, the, british, government, s, austerity, measures, during, the, great, depression, he, believed, budget, deficits, were, a, good, thing, a, product, of, recessions, he, wrote, for, government, borrowing, of, one, kind, or, another, is, nature, s, remedy, so, to, speak, for, preventing, business, losses, from, being, in, so, severe, a, slump, as, the, present, one, so, great, as, to, bring, production, altogether, to, a, standstill, at, the, height, of, the, great, depression, in, 1933, keynes, published, the, means, to, prosperity, which, contained, specific, policy, recommendations, for, tackling, unemployment, in, a, global, recession, chiefly, counter, cyclical, public, spending, the, means, to, prosperity, contains, one, of, the, first, mentions, of, the, multiplier, effect, keynes, s, magnum, opus, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, was, published, in, 1936, and, served, as, a, theoretical, justification, for, the, interventionist, policies, keynes, favoured, for, tackling, a, recession, the, general, theory, challenged, the, earlier, neo, classical, economic, paradigm, which, had, held, that, the, market, would, naturally, establish, full, employment, equilibrium, if, it, were, unfettered, by, government, interference, classical, economists, believed, in, say, s, law, which, states, that, supply, creates, its, own, demand, and, that, in, a, free, market, workers, would, always, be, willing, to, lower, their, wages, to, a, level, where, employers, could, profitably, offer, them, jobs, an, innovation, from, keynes, was, the, concept, of, price, stickiness, i, e, the, recognition, that, in, reality, workers, often, refuse, to, lower, their, wage, demands, even, in, cases, where, a, classical, economist, might, argue, it, is, rational, for, them, to, do, so, due, in, part, to, price, stickiness, it, was, established, that, the, interaction, of, aggregate, demand, and, aggregate, supply, may, lead, to, stable, unemployment, equilibria, and, in, those, cases, it, is, the, state, and, not, the, market, that, economies, must, depend, on, for, their, salvation, the, book, advocated, activist, economic, policy, by, the, government, to, stimulate, demand, in, times, of, high, unemployment, for, example, by, spending, on, public, works, in, 1928, he, wrote, let, us, be, up, and, doing, using, our, idle, resources, to, increase, our, wealth, with, men, and, plants, unemployed, it, is, ridiculous, to, say, that, we, cannot, afford, these, new, developments, it, is, precisely, with, these, plants, and, these, men, that, we, shall, afford, them, where, the, market, failed, to, allocate, resources, properly, the, government, was, required, to, stimulate, the, economy, until, private, funds, could, start, flowing, again, a, prime, the, pump, kind, of, strategy, designed, to, boost, industrial, production, liberal, feminism, the, dominant, tradition, in, feminist, history, is, an, individualistic, form, of, feminist, theory, that, focuses, on, women, s, ability, to, maintain, their, equality, through, their, actions, and, choices, liberal, feminists, hope, to, eradicate, all, barriers, to, gender, equality, claiming, that, the, continued, existence, of, such, barriers, eviscerates, the, individual, rights, and, freedoms, ostensibly, guaranteed, by, a, liberal, social, order, they, argue, that, society, believes, women, are, naturally, less, intellectually, and, physically, capable, than, men, thus, it, tends, to, discriminate, against, women, in, the, academy, the, forum, and, the, marketplace, liberal, feminists, believe, that, female, subordination, is, rooted, in, a, set, of, customary, and, legal, constraints, that, blocks, women, s, entrance, to, and, success, in, the, so, called, public, world, they, strive, for, sexual, equality, via, political, and, legal, reform, british, philosopher, mary, wollstonecraft, 1759, 1797, is, widely, regarded, as, the, pioneer, of, liberal, feminism, with, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, 1792, expanding, the, boundaries, of, liberalism, to, include, women, in, the, political, structure, of, liberal, society, in, her, writings, such, as, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, wollstonecraft, commented, on, society, s, view, of, women, and, encouraged, women, to, use, their, voices, in, making, decisions, separate, from, those, previously, made, for, them, wollstonecraft, denied, that, women, are, by, nature, more, pleasure, seeking, and, pleasure, giving, than, men, she, reasoned, that, if, they, were, confined, to, the, same, cages, that, trap, women, men, would, develop, the, same, flawed, characters, what, wollstonecraft, most, wanted, for, women, was, personhood, john, stuart, mill, was, also, an, early, proponent, of, feminism, in, his, article, the, subjection, of, women, 1861, published, 1869, mill, attempted, to, prove, that, the, legal, subjugation, of, women, is, wrong, and, that, it, should, give, way, to, perfect, equality, he, believed, that, both, sexes, should, have, equal, rights, under, the, law, and, that, until, conditions, of, equality, exist, no, one, can, possibly, assess, the, natural, differences, between, women, and, men, distorted, as, they, have, been, what, is, natural, to, the, two, sexes, can, only, be, found, out, by, allowing, both, to, develop, and, use, their, faculties, freely, mill, frequently, spoke, of, this, imbalance, and, wondered, if, women, were, able, to, feel, the, same, genuine, unselfishness, that, men, did, in, providing, for, their, families, this, unselfishness, mill, advocated, is, the, one, that, motivates, people, to, take, into, account, the, good, of, society, as, well, as, the, good, of, the, individual, person, or, small, family, unit, like, mary, wollstonecraft, mill, compared, sexual, inequality, to, slavery, arguing, that, their, husbands, are, often, just, as, abusive, as, masters, and, that, a, human, being, controls, nearly, every, aspect, of, life, for, another, human, being, in, his, book, the, subjection, of, women, mill, argues, that, three, major, parts, of, women, s, lives, are, hindering, them, society, and, gender, construction, education, and, marriage, equity, feminism, is, a, form, of, liberal, feminism, discussed, since, the, 1980s, specifically, a, kind, of, classically, liberal, or, libertarian, feminism, steven, pinker, an, evolutionary, psychologist, defines, equity, feminism, as, a, moral, doctrine, about, equal, treatment, that, makes, no, commitments, regarding, open, empirical, issues, in, psychology, or, biology, barry, kuhle, asserts, that, equity, feminism, is, compatible, with, evolutionary, psychology, in, contrast, to, gender, feminism, jean, charles, l, onard, simonde, de, sismondi, s, new, principles, of, political, economy, french, nouveaux, principes, d, conomie, politique, ou, de, la, richesse, dans, ses, rapports, avec, la, population, 1819, represents, the, first, comprehensive, liberal, critique, of, early, capitalism, and, laissez, faire, economics, and, his, writings, which, were, studied, by, john, stuart, mill, and, karl, marx, among, many, others, had, a, profound, influence, on, both, liberal, and, socialist, responses, to, the, failures, and, contradictions, of, industrial, society, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, principles, of, classical, liberalism, were, being, increasingly, challenged, by, downturns, in, economic, growth, a, growing, perception, of, the, evils, of, poverty, unemployment, and, relative, deprivation, present, within, modern, industrial, cities, as, well, as, the, agitation, of, organised, labour, the, ideal, of, the, self, made, individual, who, could, make, his, or, her, place, in, the, world, through, hard, work, and, talent, seemed, increasingly, implausible, a, major, political, reaction, against, the, changes, introduced, by, industrialisation, and, laissez, faire, capitalism, came, from, conservatives, concerned, about, social, balance, although, socialism, later, became, a, more, important, force, for, change, and, reform, some, victorian, writers, including, charles, dickens, thomas, carlyle, and, matthew, arnold, became, early, influential, critics, of, social, injustice, 36, 37, new, liberals, began, to, adapt, the, old, language, of, liberalism, to, confront, these, difficult, circumstances, which, they, believed, could, only, be, resolved, through, a, broader, and, more, interventionist, conception, of, the, state, an, equal, right, to, liberty, could, not, be, established, merely, by, ensuring, that, individuals, did, not, physically, interfere, with, each, other, or, by, having, impartially, formulated, and, applied, laws, more, positive, and, proactive, measures, were, required, to, ensure, that, every, individual, would, have, an, equal, opportunity, for, success, john, stuart, mill, contributed, enormously, to, liberal, thought, by, combining, elements, of, classical, liberalism, with, what, eventually, became, known, as, the, new, liberalism, mill, s, 1859, on, liberty, addressed, the, nature, and, limits, of, the, power, that, can, be, legitimately, exercised, by, society, over, the, individual, he, gave, an, impassioned, defence, of, free, speech, arguing, that, free, discourse, is, a, necessary, condition, for, intellectual, and, social, progress, mill, defined, social, liberty, as, protection, from, the, tyranny, of, political, rulers, he, introduced, many, different, concepts, of, the, form, tyranny, can, take, referred, to, as, social, tyranny, and, tyranny, of, the, majority, social, liberty, meant, limits, on, the, ruler, s, power, through, obtaining, recognition, of, political, liberties, or, rights, and, establishing, a, system, of, constitutional, checks, his, definition, of, liberty, influenced, by, joseph, priestley, and, josiah, warren, was, that, the, individual, ought, to, be, free, to, do, as, he, wishes, unless, he, harms, others, however, although, mill, s, initial, economic, philosophy, supported, free, markets, and, argued, that, progressive, taxation, penalised, those, who, worked, harder, he, later, altered, his, views, toward, a, more, socialist, bent, adding, chapters, to, his, principles, of, political, economy, in, defence, of, a, socialist, outlook, and, defending, some, socialist, causes, including, the, radical, proposal, that, the, whole, wage, system, be, abolished, in, favour, of, a, co, operative, wage, system, another, early, liberal, convert, to, greater, government, intervention, was, t, h, green, seeing, the, effects, of, alcohol, he, believed, that, the, state, should, foster, and, protect, the, social, political, and, economic, environments, in, which, individuals, will, have, the, best, chance, of, acting, according, to, their, consciences, the, state, should, intervene, only, where, there, is, a, clear, proven, and, strong, tendency, of, liberty, to, enslave, the, individual, green, regarded, the, national, state, as, legitimate, only, to, the, extent, that, it, upholds, a, system, of, rights, and, obligations, most, likely, to, foster, individual, self, realisation, the, new, liberalism, or, social, liberalism, movement, emerged, in, about, 1900, in, britain, the, new, liberals, including, intellectuals, like, l, t, hobhouse, and, john, a, hobson, saw, individual, liberty, as, something, achievable, only, under, favourable, social, and, economic, circumstances, 29, in, their, view, the, poverty, squalor, and, ignorance, in, which, many, people, lived, made, it, impossible, for, freedom, and, individuality, to, flourish, new, liberals, believed, these, conditions, could, be, ameliorated, only, through, collective, action, coordinated, by, a, strong, welfare, oriented, interventionist, state, it, supports, a, mixed, economy, that, includes, public, and, private, property, in, capital, goods, principles, that, can, be, described, as, social, liberal, have, been, based, upon, or, developed, by, philosophers, such, as, john, stuart, mill, eduard, bernstein, john, dewey, carlo, rosselli, norberto, bobbio, and, chantal, mouffe, other, important, social, liberal, figures, include, guido, calogero, piero, gobetti, leonard, trelawny, hobhouse, and, r, h, tawney, liberal, socialism, has, been, particularly, prominent, in, british, and, italian, politics, classical, liberalism, advocates, free, trade, under, the, rule, of, law, anarcho, capitalism, goes, one, step, further, with, law, enforcement, and, the, courts, being, provided, by, private, companies, various, theorists, have, espoused, legal, philosophies, similar, to, anarcho, capitalism, one, of, the, first, liberals, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, privatizing, the, protection, of, individual, liberty, and, property, was, france, s, jakob, mauvillon, in, the, 18th, century, later, in, the, 1840s, julius, faucher, and, gustave, de, molinari, advocated, the, same, in, his, essay, the, production, of, security, molinari, argued, no, government, should, have, the, right, to, prevent, another, government, from, going, into, competition, with, it, or, to, require, consumers, of, security, to, come, exclusively, to, it, for, this, commodity, molinari, and, this, new, type, of, anti, state, liberal, grounded, their, reasoning, on, liberal, ideals, and, classical, economics, historian, and, libertarian, ralph, raico, argued, that, what, these, liberal, philosophers, had, come, up, with, was, a, form, of, individualist, anarchism, or, as, it, would, be, called, today, anarcho, capitalism, or, market, anarchism, unlike, the, liberalism, of, locke, which, saw, the, state, as, evolving, from, society, the, anti, state, liberals, saw, a, fundamental, conflict, between, the, voluntary, interactions, of, people, i, e, society, and, the, institutions, of, force, i, e, the, state, this, society, versus, state, idea, was, expressed, in, various, ways, natural, society, vs, artificial, society, liberty, vs, authority, society, of, contract, vs, society, of, authority, and, industrial, society, vs, militant, society, to, name, a, few, the, anti, state, liberal, tradition, in, europe, and, the, united, states, continued, after, molinari, in, the, early, writings, of, herbert, spencer, and, thinkers, such, as, paul, mile, de, puydt, and, auberon, herbert, however, the, first, person, to, use, the, term, anarcho, capitalism, was, murray, rothbard, in, the, mid, 20th, century, rothbard, synthesized, elements, from, the, austrian, school, of, economics, classical, liberalism, and, 19th, century, american, individualist, anarchists, lysander, spooner, and, benjamin, tucker, while, rejecting, their, labour, theory, of, value, and, the, norms, they, derived, from, it, anarcho, capitalism, advocates, the, elimination, of, the, state, in, favour, of, individual, sovereignty, private, property, and, free, markets, anarcho, capitalists, believe, that, in, the, absence, of, statute, law, by, decree, or, legislation, society, would, improve, itself, through, the, discipline, of, the, free, market, or, what, its, proponents, describe, as, a, voluntary, society, in, a, theoretical, anarcho, capitalist, society, law, enforcement, courts, and, all, other, security, services, would, be, operated, by, privately, funded, competitors, rather, than, centrally, through, taxation, money, and, other, goods, and, services, would, be, privately, and, competitively, provided, in, an, open, market, anarcho, capitalists, say, personal, and, economic, activities, under, anarcho, capitalism, would, be, regulated, by, victim, based, dispute, resolution, organizations, under, tort, and, contract, law, rather, than, by, statute, through, centrally, determined, punishment, under, what, they, describe, as, political, monopolies, a, rothbardian, anarcho, capitalist, society, would, operate, under, a, mutually, agreed, upon, libertarian, legal, code, which, would, be, generally, accepted,

intellectual, vitality, questioned, old, traditions, and, influenced, several, european, monarchies, throughout, the, 18th, century, political, tension, between, england, and, its, american, colonies, grew, after, 1765, and, the, seven, years, war, over, the, issue, of, taxation, without, representation, culminating, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, eventually, the, declaration, of, independence, after, the, war, the, leaders, debated, about, how, to, move, forward, the, articles, of, confederation, written, in, 1776, now, appeared, inadequate, to, provide, security, or, even, a,

effect, worldwide, the, two, key, events, that, marked, the, triumph, of, liberalism, in, france, were, the, abolition, of, feudalism, in, france, on, the, night, of, 4, august, 1789, which, marked, the, collapse, of, feudal, and, old, traditional, rights, and, privileges, and, restrictions, as, well, as, the, passage, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, in,

nations, published, in, 1776, was, to, provide, most, of, the, ideas, of, economics, at, least, until, the, publication, of, john, stuart, mill, s, principles, in, 1848, 63, 68, smith, addressed, the, motivation, for, economic, activity, the, causes, of, prices, and, wealth, distribution, and, the, policies, the, state, should, follow, to, maximise, wealth, 64, the, radical, liberal, movement, began, in, the, 1790s, in, england, and, concentrated, on, parliamentary, and, electoral, reform, emphasizing, natural, rights, and, popular, sovereignty, radicals, like, richard, price, and, joseph, priestley, saw, parliamentary, reform, as, a, first, step, toward, dealing, with, their, many, grievances, including, the, treatment, of, protestant, dissenters, the, slave, trade, high, prices, and, high, taxes, in, latin, america, liberal, unrest, dates, back, to, the, 18th, century, when, liberal, agitation, in, latin, america, led, to, independence, from, the, imperial, power, of, spain, and, portugal, the, new, regimes, were, generally, liberal, in, their, political, outlook, and, employed, the, philosophy, of, positivism, which, emphasized, the, truth, of, modern, science, to, buttress, their, positions, in, the, united, states, a, vicious, war, ensured, the, integrity, of, the, nation, and, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, south, historian, don, h, doyle, has, argued, that, the, union, victory, in, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, greatly, boosted, the, course, of, liberalism, in, the, 19th, century, english, liberal, political, philosophers, were, the, most, influential, in, the, global, tradition, of, liberalism, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, middle, east, liberalism, influenced, periods, of, reform, such, as, the, tanzimat, and, al, nahda, the, rise, of, secularism, constitutionalism, and, nationalism, and, different, intellectuals, and, religious, groups, and, movements, like, the, young, ottomans, and, islamic, modernism, prominent, of, the, era, were, rifa, a, al, tahtawi, nam, k, kemal, and, brahim, inasi, however, the, reformist, ideas, and, trends, did, not, reach, the, common, population, successfully, as, the, books, periodicals, and, newspapers, were, accessible, primarily, to, intellectuals, and, segments, of, the, emerging, middle, class, many, muslims, saw, them, as, foreign, influences, on, the, world, of, islam, that, perception, complicated, reformist, efforts, made, by, middle, eastern, states, these, changes, along, with, other, factors, helped, to, create, a, sense, of, crisis, within, islam, which, continues, to, this, day, this, led, to, islamic, revivalism, abolitionist, and, suffrage, movements, spread, along, with, representative, and, democratic, ideals, france, established, an, enduring, republic, in, the, 1870s, however, nationalism, also, spread, rapidly, after, 1815, a, mixture, of, liberal, and, nationalist, sentiments, in, italy, and, germany, brought, about, the, unification, of, the, two, countries, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, liberal, regime, came, to, power, in, italy, and, ended, the, secular, power, of, the, popes, however, the, vatican, launched, a, counter, crusade, against, liberalism, pope, pius, ix, issued, the, syllabus, of, errors, in, 1864, condemning, liberalism, in, all, its, forms, in, many, countries, liberal, forces, responded, by, expelling, the, jesuit, order, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, principles, of, classical, liberalism, were, being, increasingly, challenged, and, the, ideal, of, the, self, made, individual, seemed, increasingly, implausible, victorian, writers, like, charles, dickens, thomas, carlyle, and, matthew, arnold, were, early, influential, critics, of, social, injustice, 36, 37, liberalism, gained, momentum, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, bastion, of, autocracy, the, russian, tsar, was, overthrown, in, the, first, phase, of, the, russian, revolution, the, allied, victory, in, the, first, world, war, and, the, collapse, of, four, empires, seemed, to, mark, the, triumph, of, liberalism, across, the, european, continent, not, just, among, the, victorious, allies, but, also, in, germany, and, the, newly, created, states, of, eastern, europe, militarism, as, typified, by, germany, was, defeated, and, discredited, as, blinkhorn, argues, the, liberal, themes, were, ascendant, in, terms, of, cultural, pluralism, religious, and, ethnic, toleration, national, self, determination, free, market, economics, representative, and, responsible, government, free, trade, unionism, and, the, peaceful, settlement, of, international, disputes, through, a, new, body, the, league, of, nations, in, the, middle, east, liberalism, led, to, constitutional, periods, like, the, ottoman, first, and, second, constitutional, era, and, the, persian, constitutional, period, but, it, declined, in, the, late, 1930s, due, to, the, growth, and, opposition, of, islamism, and, pan, arab, nationalism, however, many, intellectuals, advocated, liberal, values, and, ideas, prominent, liberals, were, taha, hussein, ahmed, lutfi, el, sayed, tawfiq, al, hakim, abd, el, razzak, el, sanhuri, and, muhammad, mandur, in, the, united, states, modern, liberalism, traces, its, history, to, the, popular, presidency, of, franklin, d, roosevelt, who, initiated, the, new, deal, in, response, to, the, great, depression, and, won, an, unprecedented, four, elections, the, new, deal, coalition, established, by, roosevelt, left, a, strong, legacy, and, influenced, many, future, american, presidents, including, john, f, kennedy, meanwhile, the, definitive, liberal, response, to, the, great, depression, was, given, by, the, british, economist, john, maynard, keynes, who, had, begun, a, theoretical, work, examining, the, relationship, between, unemployment, money, and, prices, back, in, the, 1920s, the, worldwide, great, depression, starting, in, 1929, hastened, the, discrediting, of, liberal, economics, and, strengthened, calls, for, state, control, over, economic, affairs, economic, woes, prompted, widespread, unrest, in, the, european, political, world, leading, to, the, rise, of, fascism, as, an, ideology, and, a, movement, against, liberalism, and, communism, especially, in, nazi, germany, and, italy, the, rise, of, fascism, in, the, 1930s, eventually, culminated, in, world, war, ii, the, deadliest, conflict, in, human, history, the, allies, prevailed, in, the, war, by, 1945, and, their, victory, set, the, stage, for, the, cold, war, between, the, communist, eastern, bloc, and, the, liberal, western, bloc, in, iran, liberalism, enjoyed, wide, popularity, in, april, 1951, the, national, front, became, the, governing, coalition, when, democratically, elected, mohammad, mosaddegh, a, liberal, nationalist, took, office, as, the, prime, minister, however, his, way, of, governing, conflicted, with, western, interests, and, he, was, removed, from, power, in, a, coup, on, 19, august, 1953, the, coup, ended, the, dominance, of, liberalism, in, the, country, s, politics, among, the, various, regional, and, national, movements, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1960s, strongly, highlighted, the, liberal, efforts, for, equal, rights, the, great, society, project, launched, by, president, lyndon, b, johnson, oversaw, the, creation, of, medicare, and, medicaid, the, establishment, of, head, start, and, the, job, corps, as, part, of, the, war, on, poverty, and, the, passage, of, the, landmark, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, an, altogether, rapid, series, of, events, that, some, historians, have, dubbed, the, liberal, hour, the, cold, war, featured, extensive, ideological, competition, and, several, proxy, wars, but, the, widely, feared, world, war, iii, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, never, occurred, while, communist, states, and, liberal, democracies, competed, against, one, another, an, economic, crisis, in, the, 1970s, inspired, a, move, away, from, keynesian, economics, especially, under, margaret, thatcher, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ronald, reagan, in, the, united, states, this, trend, known, as, neoliberalism, constituted, a, paradigm, shift, away, from, the, post, war, keynesian, consensus, which, lasted, from, 1945, to, 1980, meanwhile, nearing, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, communist, states, in, eastern, europe, collapsed, precipitously, leaving, liberal, democracies, as, the, only, major, forms, of, government, in, the, west, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, the, number, of, democracies, worldwide, was, about, the, same, as, it, had, been, forty, years, before, after, 1945, liberal, democracies, spread, very, quickly, but, then, retreated, in, the, spirit, of, democracy, larry, diamond, argues, that, by, 1974, dictatorship, not, democracy, was, the, way, of, the, world, and, that, barely, a, quarter, of, independent, states, chose, their, governments, through, competitive, free, and, fair, elections, diamond, says, that, democracy, bounced, back, and, by, 1995, the, world, was, predominantly, democratic, however, liberalism, still, faces, challenges, especially, with, the, phenomenal, growth, of, china, as, a, model, combination, of, authoritarian, government, and, economic, liberalism, liberalism, is, frequently, cited, as, the, dominant, ideology, of, the, modern, era, 11, liberalism, has, drawn, criticism, and, support, from, various, ideological, groups, throughout, its, history, despite, these, complex, relationships, some, scholars, have, argued, that, liberalism, actually, rejects, ideological, thinking, altogether, largely, because, such, thinking, could, lead, to, unrealistic, expectations, for, human, society, the, first, major, proponent, of, modern, conservative, thought, edmund, burke, offered, a, blistering, critique, of, the, french, revolution, by, assailing, the, liberal, pretensions, to, the, power, of, rationality, and, the, natural, equality, of, all, humans, conservatives, have, also, attacked, what, they, perceive, as, the, reckless, liberal, pursuit, of, progress, and, material, gains, arguing, that, such, preoccupations, undermine, traditional, social, values, rooted, in, community, and, continuity, however, a, few, variations, of, conservatism, like, liberal, conservatism, expound, some, of, the, same, ideas, and, principles, championed, by, classical, liberalism, including, small, government, and, thriving, capitalism, in, the, book, why, liberalism, failed, 2018, patrick, deneen, argued, that, liberalism, has, led, to, income, inequality, cultural, decline, atomization, nihilism, the, erosion, of, freedoms, and, the, growth, of, powerful, centralized, bureaucracies, the, book, also, argues, that, liberalism, has, replaced, old, values, of, community, religion, and, tradition, with, self, interest, russian, president, vladimir, putin, believes, that, liberalism, has, become, obsolete, and, claims, that, the, vast, majority, of, people, in, the, world, oppose, multiculturalism, immigration, and, rights, for, lgbt, people, one, of, the, most, outspoken, early, critics, of, liberalism, was, the, roman, catholic, church, which, resulted, in, lengthy, power, struggles, between, national, governments, and, the, church, a, movement, associated, with, modern, democracy, christian, democracy, hopes, to, spread, catholic, social, ideas, and, has, gained, a, large, following, in, some, european, nations, the, early, roots, of, christian, democracy, developed, as, a, reaction, against, the, industrialisation, and, urbanisation, associated, with, laissez, faire, liberalism, in, the, 19th, century, anarchists, criticize, the, liberal, social, contract, arguing, that, it, creates, a, state, that, is, oppressive, violent, corrupt, and, inimical, to, liberty, karl, marx, rejected, the, foundational, aspects, of, liberal, theory, hoping, to, destroy, both, the, state, and, the, liberal, distinction, between, society, and, the, individual, while, fusing, the, two, into, a, collective, whole, designed, to, overthrow, the, developing, capitalist, order, of, the, 19th, century, vladimir, lenin, stated, that, in, contrast, with, marxism, liberal, science, defends, wage, slavery, however, some, proponents, of, liberalism, such, as, thomas, paine, george, henry, evans, and, silvio, gesell, were, critics, of, wage, slavery, deng, xiaoping, criticized, that, liberalization, would, destroy, the, political, stability, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, the, chinese, communist, party, making, it, difficult, for, development, to, take, place, and, is, inherently, capitalistic, he, termed, it, bourgeois, liberalization, thus, some, socialists, accuse, the, economic, doctrines, of, liberalism, such, as, individual, economic, freedom, of, giving, rise, to, what, they, view, as, a, system, of, exploitation, that, goes, against, the, democratic, principles, of, liberalism, while, some, liberals, oppose, the, wage, slavery, that, the, economic, doctrines, of, capitalism, allow, some, feminists, argue, that, liberalism, s, emphasis, on, distinguishing, between, the, private, and, public, spheres, in, society, allow, the, flourishing, of, bigotry, and, intolerance, in, the, private, sphere, and, to, require, respect, for, equality, only, in, the, public, sphere, making, liberalism, vulnerable, to, the, right, wing, populist, attack, political, liberalism, has, rejected, the, feminist, call, to, recognize, that, the, personal, is, political, and, has, relied, on, political, institutions, and, processes, as, barriers, against, illiberalism, social, democracy, an, ideology, advocating, modification, of, capitalism, along, progressive, lines, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, and, was, influenced, by, socialism, broadly, defined, as, a, project, that, aims, to, correct, through, government, reform, what, it, regards, as, the, intrinsic, defects, of, capitalism, by, reducing, inequality, social, democracy, does, not, oppose, the, existence, of, the, state, several, commentators, have, noted, strong, similarities, between, social, liberalism, and, social, democracy, with, one, political, scientist, calling, american, liberalism, bootleg, social, democracy, due, to, the, absence, of, a, significant, social, democratic, tradition, in, the, united, states, fascists, accuse, liberalism, of, materialism, and, a, lack, of, spiritual, values, in, particular, fascism, opposes, liberalism, for, its, materialism, rationalism, individualism, and, utilitarianism, fascists, believe, that, the, liberal, emphasis, on, individual, freedom, produces, national, divisiveness, but, many, fascists, agree, with, liberals, in, their, support, of, private, property, rights, and, a, market, economy, notes
