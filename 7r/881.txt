https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription
conscription, is, the, state, mandated, enlistment, of, people, in, a, national, service, mainly, a, military, service, conscription, dates, back, to, antiquity, and, it, continues, in, some, countries, to, the, present, day, under, various, names, the, modern, system, of, near, universal, national, conscription, for, young, men, dates, to, the, french, revolution, in, the, 1790s, where, it, became, the, basis, of, a, very, large, and, powerful, military, most, european, nations, later, copied, the, system, in, peacetime, so, that, men, at, a, certain, age, would, serve, 1, to, 8, years, on, active, duty, and, then, transfer, to, the, reserve, force, conscription, is, controversial, for, a, range, of, reasons, including, conscientious, objection, to, military, engagements, on, religious, or, philosophical, grounds, political, objection, for, example, to, service, for, a, disliked, government, or, unpopular, war, sexism, in, that, historically, men, have, been, subject, to, the, draft, in, the, most, cases, and, ideological, objection, for, example, to, a, perceived, violation, of, individual, rights, those, conscripted, may, evade, service, sometimes, by, leaving, the, country, and, seeking, asylum, in, another, country, some, selection, systems, accommodate, these, attitudes, by, providing, alternative, service, outside, combat, operations, roles, or, even, outside, the, military, such, as, siviilipalvelus, alternative, civil, service, in, finland, and, zivildienst, compulsory, community, service, in, austria, and, switzerland, several, countries, conscript, male, soldiers, not, only, for, armed, forces, but, also, for, paramilitary, agencies, which, are, dedicated, to, police, like, domestic, only, service, like, internal, troops, border, guards, or, non, combat, rescue, duties, like, civil, defence, as, of, 2023, many, states, no, longer, conscript, their, citizens, relying, instead, upon, professional, militaries, with, volunteers, the, ability, to, rely, on, such, an, arrangement, however, presupposes, some, degree, of, predictability, with, regard, to, both, war, fighting, requirements, and, the, scope, of, hostilities, many, states, that, have, abolished, conscription, still, therefore, reserve, the, power, to, resume, conscription, during, wartime, or, times, of, crisis, states, involved, in, wars, or, interstate, rivalries, are, most, likely, to, implement, conscription, and, democracies, are, less, likely, than, autocracies, to, implement, conscription, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, singapore, and, egypt, former, british, colonies, are, less, likely, to, have, conscription, as, they, are, influenced, by, british, anti, conscription, norms, that, can, be, traced, back, to, the, english, civil, war, the, united, kingdom, abolished, conscription, in, 1960, around, the, reign, of, hammurabi, 1791, 1750, bc, the, babylonian, empire, used, a, system, of, conscription, called, ilkum, under, that, system, those, eligible, were, required, to, serve, in, the, royal, army, in, time, of, war, during, times, of, peace, they, were, instead, required, to, provide, labour, for, other, activities, of, the, state, in, return, for, this, service, people, subject, to, it, gained, the, right, to, hold, land, it, is, possible, that, this, right, was, not, to, hold, land, per, se, but, specific, land, supplied, by, the, state, various, forms, of, avoiding, military, service, are, recorded, while, it, was, outlawed, by, the, code, of, hammurabi, the, hiring, of, substitutes, appears, to, have, been, practiced, both, before, and, after, the, creation, of, the, code, later, records, show, that, ilkum, commitments, could, become, regularly, traded, in, other, places, people, simply, left, their, towns, to, avoid, their, ilkum, service, another, option, was, to, sell, ilkum, lands, and, the, commitments, along, with, them, with, the, exception, of, a, few, exempted, classes, this, was, forbidden, by, the, code, of, hammurabi, under, the, feudal, laws, on, the, european, continent, landowners, in, the, medieval, period, enforced, a, system, whereby, all, peasants, freemen, commoners, and, noblemen, aged, 15, to, 60, living, in, the, countryside, or, in, urban, centers, were, summoned, for, military, duty, when, required, by, either, the, king, or, the, local, lord, bringing, along, the, weapons, and, armor, according, to, their, wealth, these, levies, fought, as, footmen, sergeants, and, men, at, arms, under, local, superiors, appointed, by, the, king, or, the, local, lord, such, as, the, arri, re, ban, in, france, arri, re, ban, denoted, a, general, levy, where, all, able, bodied, males, age, 15, to, 60, living, in, the, kingdom, of, france, were, summoned, to, go, to, war, by, the, king, or, the, constable, and, the, marshals, men, were, summoned, by, the, bailiff, or, the, s, n, chal, in, the, south, bailiffs, were, military, and, political, administrators, installed, by, the, king, to, steward, and, govern, a, specific, area, of, a, province, following, the, king, s, commands, and, orders, the, men, summoned, in, this, way, were, then, summoned, by, the, lieutenant, who, was, the, king, s, representative, and, military, governor, over, an, entire, province, comprising, many, bailiwicks, seneschalties, and, castellanies, all, men, from, the, richest, noble, to, the, poorest, commoner, were, summoned, under, the, arri, re, ban, and, they, were, supposed, to, present, themselves, to, the, king, or, his, officials, in, medieval, scandinavia, the, lei, angr, old, norse, leidang, norwegian, leding, danish, ledung, swedish, lichting, dutch, expeditio, latin, or, sometimes, le, ing, old, english, was, a, levy, of, free, farmers, conscripted, into, coastal, fleets, for, seasonal, excursions, and, in, defence, of, the, realm, the, bulk, of, the, anglo, saxon, english, army, called, the, fyrd, was, composed, of, part, time, english, soldiers, drawn, from, the, freemen, of, each, county, in, the, 690s, laws, of, ine, of, wessex, three, levels, of, fines, are, imposed, on, different, social, classes, for, neglecting, military, service, some, modern, writers, claim, military, service, in, europe, was, restricted, to, the, landowning, minor, nobility, these, thegns, were, the, land, holding, aristocracy, of, the, time, and, were, required, to, serve, with, their, own, armour, and, weapons, for, a, certain, number, of, days, each, year, the, historian, david, sturdy, has, cautioned, about, regarding, the, fyrd, as, a, precursor, to, a, modern, national, army, composed, of, all, ranks, of, society, describing, it, as, a, ridiculous, fantasy, the, persistent, old, belief, that, peasants, and, small, farmers, gathered, to, form, a, national, army, or, fyrd, is, a, strange, delusion, dreamt, up, by, antiquarians, in, the, late, eighteenth, or, early, nineteenth, centuries, to, justify, universal, military, conscription, in, feudal, japan, the, shogun, decree, of, 1393, exempted, money, lenders, from, religious, or, military, levies, in, return, for, a, yearly, tax, the, nin, war, weakened, the, shogun, and, levies, were, imposed, again, on, money, lenders, this, overlordism, was, arbitrary, and, unpredictable, for, commoners, while, the, money, lenders, were, not, poor, several, overlords, tapped, them, for, income, levies, became, necessary, for, the, survival, of, the, overlord, allowing, the, lord, to, impose, taxes, at, will, these, levies, included, tansen, tax, on, agricultural, land, for, ceremonial, expenses, y, akubu, takumai, tax, was, raised, on, all, land, to, rebuild, the, ise, grand, shrine, and, munabechisen, tax, was, imposed, on, all, houses, at, the, time, land, in, kyoto, was, acquired, by, commoners, through, usury, and, in, 1422, the, shogun, threatened, to, repossess, the, land, of, those, commoners, who, failed, to, pay, their, levies, the, system, of, military, slaves, was, widely, used, in, the, middle, east, beginning, with, the, creation, of, the, corps, of, turkic, slave, soldiers, ghulams, or, mamluks, by, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mu, tasim, in, the, 820s, and, 830s, the, turkic, troops, soon, came, to, dominate, the, government, establishing, a, pattern, throughout, the, islamic, world, of, a, ruling, military, class, often, separated, by, ethnicity, culture, and, even, religion, by, the, mass, of, the, population, a, paradigm, that, found, its, apogee, in, the, mamluks, of, egypt, and, the, janissary, corps, of, the, ottoman, empire, institutions, that, survived, until, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, ottoman, sultan, murad, i, developed, personal, troops, to, be, loyal, to, him, with, a, slave, army, called, the, kap, kulu, the, new, force, was, built, by, taking, christian, children, from, newly, conquered, lands, especially, from, the, far, areas, of, his, empire, in, a, system, known, as, the, dev, irme, translated, gathering, or, converting, the, captive, children, were, forced, to, convert, to, islam, the, sultans, had, the, young, boys, trained, over, several, years, those, who, showed, special, promise, in, fighting, skills, were, trained, in, advanced, warrior, skills, put, into, the, sultan, s, personal, service, and, turned, into, the, janissaries, the, elite, branch, of, the, kap, kulu, a, number, of, distinguished, military, commanders, of, the, ottomans, and, most, of, the, imperial, administrators, and, upper, level, officials, of, the, empire, such, as, pargal, brahim, pasha, and, sokollu, mehmet, pa, a, were, recruited, in, this, way, by, 1609, the, sultan, s, kap, kulu, forces, increased, to, about, 100, 000, in, later, years, sultans, turned, to, the, barbary, pirates, to, supply, their, jannissaries, corps, their, attacks, on, ships, off, the, coast, of, africa, or, in, the, mediterranean, and, subsequent, capture, of, able, bodied, men, for, ransom, or, sale, provided, some, captives, for, the, sultan, s, system, starting, in, the, 17th, century, christian, families, living, under, the, ottoman, rule, began, to, submit, their, sons, into, the, kapikulu, system, willingly, as, they, saw, this, as, a, potentially, invaluable, career, opportunity, for, their, children, eventually, the, sultan, turned, to, foreign, volunteers, from, the, warrior, clans, of, circassians, in, southern, russia, to, fill, his, janissary, armies, as, a, whole, the, system, began, to, break, down, the, loyalty, of, the, jannissaries, became, increasingly, suspect, mahmud, ii, forcibly, disbanded, the, janissary, corps, in, 1826, similar, to, the, janissaries, in, origin, and, means, of, development, were, the, mamluks, of, egypt, in, the, middle, ages, the, mamluks, were, usually, captive, non, muslim, iranian, and, turkic, children, who, had, been, kidnapped, or, bought, as, slaves, from, the, barbary, coasts, the, egyptians, assimilated, and, trained, the, boys, and, young, men, to, become, islamic, soldiers, who, served, the, muslim, caliphs, and, the, ayyubid, sultans, during, the, middle, ages, the, first, mamluks, served, the, abbasid, caliphs, in, 9th, century, baghdad, over, time, they, became, a, powerful, military, caste, on, more, than, one, occasion, they, seized, power, for, example, ruling, egypt, from, 1250, to, 1517, from, 1250, egypt, had, been, ruled, by, the, bahri, dynasty, of, kipchak, origin, slaves, from, the, caucasus, served, in, the, army, and, formed, an, elite, corps, of, troops, they, eventually, revolted, in, egypt, to, form, the, burgi, dynasty, the, mamluks, excellent, fighting, abilities, massed, islamic, armies, and, overwhelming, numbers, succeeded, in, overcoming, the, christian, crusader, fortresses, in, the, holy, land, the, mamluks, were, the, most, successful, defence, against, the, mongol, ilkhanate, of, persia, and, iraq, from, entering, egypt, on, the, western, coast, of, africa, berber, muslims, captured, non, muslims, to, put, to, work, as, laborers, they, generally, converted, the, younger, people, to, islam, and, many, became, quite, assimilated, in, morocco, the, berber, looked, south, rather, than, north, the, moroccan, sultan, moulay, ismail, called, the, bloodthirsty, 1672, 1727, employed, a, corps, of, 150, 000, black, slaves, called, his, black, guard, he, used, them, to, coerce, the, country, into, submission, modern, conscription, the, massed, military, enlistment, of, national, citizens, lev, e, en, masse, was, devised, during, the, french, revolution, to, enable, the, republic, to, defend, itself, from, the, attacks, of, european, monarchies, deputy, jean, baptiste, jourdan, gave, its, name, to, the, 5, september, 1798, act, whose, first, article, stated, any, frenchman, is, a, soldier, and, owes, himself, to, the, defense, of, the, nation, it, enabled, the, creation, of, the, grande, arm, e, what, napoleon, bonaparte, called, the, nation, in, arms, which, overwhelmed, european, professional, armies, that, often, numbered, only, into, the, low, tens, of, thousands, more, than, 2, 6, million, men, were, inducted, into, the, french, military, in, this, way, between, the, years, 1800, and, 1813, the, defeat, of, the, prussian, army, in, particular, shocked, the, prussian, establishment, which, had, believed, it, was, invincible, after, the, victories, of, frederick, the, great, the, prussians, were, used, to, relying, on, superior, organization, and, tactical, factors, such, as, order, of, battle, to, focus, superior, troops, against, inferior, ones, given, approximately, equivalent, forces, as, was, generally, the, case, with, professional, armies, these, factors, showed, considerable, importance, however, they, became, considerably, less, important, when, the, prussian, armies, faced, napoleon, s, forces, that, outnumbered, their, own, in, some, cases, by, more, than, ten, to, one, scharnhorst, advocated, adopting, the, lev, e, en, masse, the, military, conscription, used, by, france, the, kr, mpersystem, was, the, beginning, of, short, term, compulsory, service, in, prussia, as, opposed, to, the, long, term, conscription, previously, used, in, the, russian, empire, the, military, service, time, owed, by, serfs, was, 25, years, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1834, it, was, decreased, to, 20, years, the, recruits, were, to, be, not, younger, than, 17, and, not, older, than, 35, in, 1874, russia, introduced, universal, conscription, in, the, modern, pattern, an, innovation, only, made, possible, by, the, abolition, of, serfdom, in, 1861, new, military, law, decreed, that, all, male, russian, subjects, when, they, reached, the, age, of, 20, were, eligible, to, serve, in, the, military, for, six, years, in, the, decades, prior, to, world, war, i, universal, conscription, along, broadly, prussian, lines, became, the, norm, for, european, armies, and, those, modeled, on, them, by, 1914, the, only, substantial, armies, still, completely, dependent, on, voluntary, enlistment, were, those, of, britain, and, the, united, states, some, colonial, powers, such, as, france, reserved, their, conscript, armies, for, home, service, while, maintaining, professional, units, for, overseas, duties, the, range, of, eligible, ages, for, conscripting, was, expanded, to, meet, national, demand, during, the, world, wars, in, the, united, states, the, selective, service, system, drafted, men, for, world, war, i, initially, in, an, age, range, from, 21, to, 30, but, expanded, its, eligibility, in, 1918, to, an, age, range, of, 18, to, 45, in, the, case, of, a, widespread, mobilization, of, forces, where, service, includes, homefront, defense, ages, of, conscripts, may, range, much, higher, with, the, oldest, conscripts, serving, in, roles, requiring, lesser, mobility, expanded, age, conscription, was, common, during, the, second, world, war, in, britain, it, was, commonly, known, as, call, up, and, extended, to, age, 51, nazi, germany, termed, it, volkssturm, people, s, storm, and, included, boys, as, young, as, 16, and, men, as, old, as, 60, during, the, second, world, war, both, britain, and, the, soviet, union, conscripted, women, the, united, states, was, on, the, verge, of, drafting, women, into, the, nurse, corps, because, it, anticipated, it, would, need, the, extra, personnel, for, its, planned, invasion, of, japan, however, the, japanese, surrendered, and, the, idea, was, abandoned, during, the, great, patriotic, war, the, red, army, conscripted, nearly, 30, million, men, men, s, rights, activists, feminists, and, opponents, of, discrimination, against, men, 102, have, criticized, military, conscription, or, compulsory, military, service, as, sexist, the, national, coalition, for, men, a, men, s, rights, group, sued, the, us, selective, service, system, in, 2019, leading, to, it, being, declared, unconstitutional, by, a, us, federal, judge, the, federal, district, judge, s, opinion, was, unanimously, overturned, on, appeal, to, the, u, s, court, of, appeals, for, the, 5th, circuit, in, september, 2021, the, house, of, representatives, passed, the, annual, defense, authorization, act, which, included, an, amendment, that, states, that, all, americans, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 25, must, register, for, selective, service, this, amendment, omitted, the, word, male, which, would, have, extended, a, potential, draft, to, women, however, the, amendment, was, removed, before, the, national, defense, authorization, act, was, passed, feminists, have, argued, first, that, military, conscription, is, sexist, because, wars, serve, the, interests, of, what, they, view, as, the, patriarchy, second, that, the, military, is, a, sexist, institution, and, that, conscripts, are, therefore, indoctrinated, into, sexism, and, third, that, conscription, of, men, normalizes, violence, by, men, as, socially, acceptable, feminists, have, been, organizers, and, participants, in, resistance, to, conscription, in, several, countries, conscription, has, also, been, criticized, on, the, ground, that, historically, only, men, have, been, subjected, to, conscription, men, who, opt, out, or, are, deemed, unfit, for, military, service, must, often, perform, alternative, service, such, as, zivildienst, in, austria, germany, and, switzerland, or, pay, extra, taxes, whereas, women, do, not, have, these, obligations, in, the, us, men, who, do, not, register, with, the, selective, service, cannot, apply, for, citizenship, receive, federal, financial, aid, grants, or, loans, be, employed, by, the, federal, government, be, admitted, to, public, colleges, or, universities, or, in, some, states, obtain, a, driver, s, license, many, american, libertarians, oppose, conscription, and, call, for, the, abolition, of, the, selective, service, system, arguing, that, impressment, of, individuals, into, the, armed, forces, amounts, to, involuntary, servitude, for, example, ron, paul, a, former, u, s, libertarian, party, presidential, nominee, has, said, that, conscription, is, wrongly, associated, with, patriotism, when, it, really, represents, slavery, and, involuntary, servitude, the, philosopher, ayn, rand, opposed, conscription, opining, that, of, all, the, statist, violations, of, individual, rights, in, a, mixed, economy, the, military, draft, is, the, worst, it, is, an, abrogation, of, rights, it, negates, man, s, fundamental, right, the, right, to, life, and, establishes, the, fundamental, principle, of, statism, that, a, man, s, life, belongs, to, the, state, and, the, state, may, claim, it, by, compelling, him, to, sacrifice, it, in, battle, in, 1917, a, number, of, radicals, and, anarchists, including, emma, goldman, challenged, the, new, draft, law, in, federal, court, arguing, that, it, was, a, violation, of, the, thirteenth, amendment, s, prohibition, against, slavery, and, involuntary, servitude, however, the, supreme, court, unanimously, upheld, the, constitutionality, of, the, draft, act, in, the, case, of, arver, v, united, states, on, 7, january, 1918, on, the, ground, that, the, constitution, gives, congress, the, power, to, declare, war, and, to, raise, and, support, armies, the, court, also, relied, on, the, principle, of, the, reciprocal, rights, and, duties, of, citizens, it, may, not, be, doubted, that, the, very, conception, of, a, just, government, in, its, duty, to, the, citizen, includes, the, reciprocal, obligation, of, the, citizen, to, render, military, service, in, case, of, need, and, the, right, to, compel, it, can, be, argued, that, in, a, cost, to, benefit, ratio, conscription, during, peacetime, is, not, worthwhile, months, or, years, of, service, performed, by, the, most, fit, and, capable, subtract, from, the, productivity, of, the, economy, add, to, this, the, cost, of, training, them, and, in, some, countries, paying, them, compared, to, these, extensive, costs, some, would, argue, there, is, very, little, benefit, if, there, ever, was, a, war, then, conscription, and, basic, training, could, be, completed, quickly, and, in, any, case, there, is, little, threat, of, a, war, in, most, countries, with, conscription, in, the, united, states, every, male, resident, is, required, by, law, to, register, with, the, selective, service, system, within, 30, days, following, his, 18th, birthday, and, be, available, for, a, draft, this, is, often, accomplished, automatically, by, a, motor, vehicle, department, during, licensing, or, by, voter, registration, according, to, milton, friedman, the, cost, of, conscription, can, be, related, to, the, parable, of, the, broken, window, in, anti, draft, arguments, the, cost, of, the, work, military, service, does, not, disappear, even, if, no, salary, is, paid, the, work, effort, of, the, conscripts, is, effectively, wasted, as, an, unwilling, workforce, is, extremely, inefficient, the, impact, is, especially, severe, in, wartime, when, civilian, professionals, are, forced, to, fight, as, amateur, soldiers, not, only, is, the, work, effort, of, the, conscripts, wasted, and, productivity, lost, but, professionally, skilled, conscripts, are, also, difficult, to, replace, in, the, civilian, workforce, every, soldier, conscripted, in, the, army, is, taken, away, from, his, civilian, work, and, away, from, contributing, to, the, economy, which, funds, the, military, this, may, be, less, a, problem, in, an, agrarian, or, pre, industrialized, state, where, the, level, of, education, is, generally, low, and, where, a, worker, is, easily, replaced, by, another, however, this, is, potentially, more, costly, in, a, post, industrial, society, where, educational, levels, are, high, and, where, the, workforce, is, sophisticated, and, a, replacement, for, a, conscripted, specialist, is, difficult, to, find, even, more, dire, economic, consequences, result, if, the, professional, conscripted, as, an, amateur, soldier, is, killed, or, maimed, for, life, his, work, effort, and, productivity, are, lost, jean, jacques, rousseau, argued, vehemently, against, professional, armies, since, he, believed, that, it, was, the, right, and, privilege, of, every, citizen, to, participate, to, the, defense, of, the, whole, society, and, that, it, was, a, mark, of, moral, decline, to, leave, the, business, to, professionals, he, based, his, belief, upon, the, development, of, the, roman, republic, which, came, to, an, end, at, the, same, time, as, the, roman, army, changed, from, a, conscript, to, a, professional, force, similarly, aristotle, linked, the, division, of, armed, service, among, the, populace, intimately, with, the, political, order, of, the, state, niccol, machiavelli, argued, strongly, for, conscription, and, saw, the, professional, armies, made, up, of, mercenary, units, as, the, cause, of, the, failure, of, societal, unity, in, italy, other, proponents, such, as, william, james, consider, both, mandatory, military, and, national, service, as, ways, of, instilling, maturity, in, young, adults, some, proponents, such, as, jonathan, alter, and, mickey, kaus, support, a, draft, in, order, to, reinforce, social, equality, create, social, consciousness, break, down, class, divisions, and, allow, young, adults, to, immerse, themselves, in, public, enterprise, charles, rangel, called, for, the, reinstatement, of, the, draft, during, the, iraq, war, not, because, he, seriously, expected, it, to, be, adopted, but, to, stress, how, the, socioeconomic, restratification, meant, that, very, few, children, of, upper, class, americans, served, in, the, all, volunteer, american, armed, forces, it, is, estimated, by, the, british, military, that, in, a, professional, military, a, company, deployed, for, active, duty, in, peacekeeping, corresponds, to, three, inactive, companies, at, home, salaries, for, each, are, paid, from, the, military, budget, in, contrast, volunteers, from, a, trained, reserve, are, in, their, civilian, jobs, when, they, are, not, deployed, it, was, more, financially, beneficial, for, less, educated, young, portuguese, men, born, in, 1967, to, participate, in, conscription, than, to, participate, in, the, highly, competitive, job, market, with, men, of, the, same, age, who, continued, to, higher, education, throughout, history, women, have, only, been, conscripted, to, join, armed, forces, in, a, few, countries, in, contrast, to, the, universal, practice, of, conscription, from, among, the, male, population, the, traditional, view, has, been, that, military, service, is, a, test, of, manhood, and,

the, fifth, amendment, by, requiring, that, only, men, register, with, the, selective, service, system, sss, the, supreme, court, eventually, upheld, the, act, stating, that, the, argument, for, registering, women, was, based, on, considerations, of, equity, but, congress, was, entitled, in, the, exercise, of, its, constitutional, powers, to, focus, on, the, question, of, military, need, rather, than, equity, in, 2013, judge, gray, h, miller, of, the, united, states, district, court, for, the, southern, district, of, texas, ruled, that, the, service, s, men, only, requirement, was,

kavanaugh, the, three, justices, agreed, that, the, male, only, draft, was, likely, unconstitutional, given, the, changes, in, the, military, s, stance, on, the, roles, but, because, congress, had, been, reviewing, and, evaluating, legislation, to, eliminate, its, male, only, draft, requirement, via, the, national, commission, on, military, national, and, public, service, ncmnps, since, 2016,

considered, that, the, physical, differences, between, males, and, females, and, the, derived, role, differentiation, in, their, respective, social, functions, and, lives, would, not, make, drafting,

expressed, their, support, for, the, return, of, conscription, most, notably, krasimir, karakachanov, opposition, towards, this, idea, from, the, main, coalition, partner, gerb, saw, a, compromise, in, 2018, where, instead, of, conscription, bulgaria, could, have, possibly, introduced, a, voluntary, military, service, by, 2019, where, young, citizens, can, volunteer, for, a, period, of, 6, to, 9, months, receiving, a, basic, wage, however, this, has, not, gone, forward, since, the, signing, of, the, peace, accord, in, 1993, there, has, been, no, official, conscription, in, cambodia, also,
