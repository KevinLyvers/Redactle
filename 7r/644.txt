a, government, is, the, system, or, group, of, people, governing, an, organized, community, generally, a, state, in, the, case, of, its, broad, associative, definition, government, normally, consists, of, legislature, executive, and, judiciary, government, is, a, means, by, which, organizational, policies, are, enforced, as, well, as, a, mechanism, for, determining, policy, in, many, countries, the, government, has, a, kind, of, constitution, a, statement, of, its, governing, principles, and, philosophy, while, all, types, of, organizations, have, governance, the, term, government, is, often, used, more, specifically, to, refer, to, the, approximately, 200, independent, national, governments, and, subsidiary, organizations, the, main, types, of, modern, political, systems, recognized, are, democracies, totalitarian, regimes, and, sitting, between, these, two, authoritarian, regimes, with, a, variety, of, hybrid, regimes, modern, classification, system, also, include, monarchies, as, a, standalone, entity, or, as, a, hybrid, system, of, the, main, three, historically, prevalent, forms, of, government, include, monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and, tyranny, these, forms, are, not, always, mutually, exclusive, and, mixed, governments, are, common, the, main, aspect, of, any, philosophy, of, government, is, how, political, power, is, obtained, with, the, two, main, forms, being, electoral, contest, and, hereditary, succession, a, government, is, the, system, to, govern, a, state, or, community, the, columbia, encyclopedia, defines, government, as, a, system, of, social, control, under, which, the, right, to, make, laws, and, the, right, to, enforce, them, is, vested, in, a, particular, group, in, society, while, all, types, of, organizations, have, governance, the, word, government, is, often, used, more, specifically, to, refer, to, the, approximately, 200, independent, national, governments, on, earth, as, well, as, their, subsidiary, organizations, such, as, state, and, provincial, governments, as, well, as, local, governments, the, word, government, derives, from, the, greek, verb, meaning, to, steer, with, a, gubernaculum, rudder, the, metaphorical, sense, being, attested, in, the, literature, of, classical, antiquity, including, plato, s, ship, of, state, in, british, english, government, sometimes, refers, to, what, s, also, known, as, a, ministry, or, an, administration, i, e, the, policies, and, government, officials, of, a, particular, executive, or, governing, coalition, finally, government, is, also, sometimes, used, in, english, as, a, synonym, for, rule, or, governance, in, other, languages, cognates, may, have, a, narrower, scope, such, as, the, government, of, portugal, which, is, actually, more, similar, to, the, concept, of, administration, the, moment, and, place, that, the, phenomenon, of, human, government, developed, is, lost, in, time, however, history, does, record, the, formations, of, early, governments, about, 5, 000, years, ago, the, first, small, city, states, appeared, by, the, third, to, second, millenniums, bc, some, of, these, had, developed, into, larger, governed, areas, sumer, ancient, egypt, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, the, yellow, river, civilization, one, reason, that, explains, the, emergence, of, governments, includes, agriculture, since, the, neolithic, revolution, agriculture, was, an, efficient, method, to, create, food, surplus, this, enabled, people, to, specialize, in, non, agricultural, activities, some, of, them, included, being, able, to, rule, over, others, as, an, external, authority, others, included, social, experimentation, with, diverse, governance, models, both, these, activities, formed, the, basis, of, governments, these, governments, gradually, became, more, complex, as, agriculture, supported, larger, and, denser, populations, creating, new, interactions, and, social, pressures, that, the, government, needed, to, control, david, christian, explains, as, farming, populations, gathered, in, larger, and, denser, communities, interactions, between, different, groups, increased, and, the, social, pressure, rose, until, in, a, striking, parallel, with, star, formation, new, structures, suddenly, appeared, together, with, a, new, level, of, complexity, like, stars, cities, and, states, reorganize, and, energize, the, smaller, objects, within, their, gravitational, field, another, explanation, includes, the, need, to, properly, manage, infrastructure, projects, such, as, water, infrastructure, historically, this, required, centralized, administration, and, complex, social, organisation, as, seen, in, regions, like, mesopotamia, however, there, is, archaeological, evidence, that, shows, similar, successes, with, more, egalitarian, and, decentralized, complex, societies, starting, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, prevalence, of, republican, forms, of, government, grew, the, english, civil, war, and, glorious, revolution, in, england, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, revolution, contributed, to, the, growth, of, representative, forms, of, government, the, soviet, union, was, the, first, large, country, to, have, a, communist, government, since, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, liberal, democracy, has, become, an, even, more, prevalent, form, of, government, in, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, century, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, the, size, and, scale, of, government, at, the, national, level, this, included, the, regulation, of, corporations, and, the, development, of, the, welfare, state, in, political, science, it, has, long, been, a, goal, to, create, a, typology, or, taxonomy, of, polities, as, typologies, of, political, systems, are, not, obvious, it, is, especially, important, in, the, political, science, fields, of, comparative, politics, and, international, relations, like, all, categories, discerned, within, forms, of, government, the, boundaries, of, government, classifications, are, either, fluid, or, ill, defined, superficially, all, governments, have, an, official, de, jure, or, ideal, form, the, united, states, is, a, federal, constitutional, republic, while, the, former, soviet, union, was, a, federal, socialist, republic, however, self, identification, is, not, objective, and, as, kopstein, and, lichbach, argue, defining, regimes, can, be, tricky, especially, de, facto, when, both, its, government, and, its, economy, deviate, in, practice, for, example, voltaire, argued, that, the, holy, roman, empire, is, neither, holy, nor, roman, nor, an, empire, in, practice, the, soviet, union, was, a, centralized, autocratic, one, party, state, under, joseph, stalin, identifying, a, form, of, government, is, also, difficult, because, many, political, systems, originate, as, socio, economic, movements, and, are, then, carried, into, governments, by, parties, naming, themselves, after, those, movements, all, with, competing, political, ideologies, experience, with, those, movements, in, power, and, the, strong, ties, they, may, have, to, particular, forms, of, government, can, cause, them, to, be, considered, as, forms, of, government, in, themselves, other, complications, include, general, non, consensus, or, deliberate, distortion, or, bias, of, reasonable, technical, definitions, to, political, ideologies, and, associated, forms, of, governing, due, to, the, nature, of, politics, in, the, modern, era, for, example, the, meaning, of, conservatism, in, the, united, states, has, little, in, common, with, the, way, the, word, s, definition, is, used, elsewhere, as, ribuffo, notes, what, americans, now, call, conservatism, much, of, the, world, calls, liberalism, or, neoliberalism, a, conservative, in, finland, would, be, labeled, a, socialist, in, the, united, states, since, the, 1950s, conservatism, in, the, united, states, has, been, chiefly, associated, with, right, wing, politics, and, the, republican, party, however, during, the, era, of, segregation, many, southern, democrats, were, conservatives, and, they, played, a, key, role, in, the, conservative, coalition, that, controlled, congress, from, 1937, to, 1963, opinions, vary, by, individuals, concerning, the, types, and, properties, of, governments, that, exist, shades, of, gray, are, commonplace, in, any, government, and, its, corresponding, classification, even, the, most, liberal, democracies, limit, rival, political, activity, to, one, extent, or, another, while, the, most, tyrannical, dictatorships, must, organize, a, broad, base, of, support, thereby, creating, difficulties, for, pigeonholing, governments, into, narrow, categories, examples, include, the, claims, of, the, united, states, as, being, a, plutocracy, rather, than, a, democracy, since, some, american, voters, believe, elections, are, being, manipulated, by, wealthy, super, pacs, some, consider, that, government, is, to, be, reconceptualised, where, in, times, of, climatic, change, the, needs, and, desires, of, the, individual, are, reshaped, to, generate, sufficiency, for, all, a, quality, of, a, government, can, be, measured, by, government, effectiveness, index, which, relates, to, political, efficacy, and, state, capacity, list, of, forms, of, government, plato, in, his, book, the, republic, 375, bc, divided, governments, into, five, basic, types, four, being, existing, forms, and, one, being, plato, s, ideal, form, which, exists, only, in, speech, these, five, regimes, progressively, degenerate, starting, with, aristocracy, at, the, top, and, tyranny, at, the, bottom, in, his, politics, aristotle, elaborates, on, plato, s, five, regimes, discussing, them, in, relation, to, the, government, of, one, of, the, few, and, of, the, many, from, this, follows, the, classification, of, forms, of, government, according, to, which, people, have, the, authority, to, rule, either, one, person, an, autocracy, such, as, monarchy, a, select, group, of, people, an, aristocracy, or, the, people, as, a, whole, a, democracy, such, as, a, republic, thomas, hobbes, stated, on, their, classification, the, difference, of, commonwealths, consisteth, in, the, difference, of, the, sovereign, or, the, person, representative, of, all, and, every, one, of, the, multitude, and, because, the, sovereignty, is, either, in, one, man, or, in, an, assembly, of, more, than, one, and, into, that, assembly, either, every, man, hath, right, to, enter, or, not, every, one, but, certain, men, distinguished, from, the, rest, it, is, manifest, there, can, be, but, three, kinds, of, commonwealth, for, the, representative, must, needs, be, one, man, or, more, and, if, more, then, it, is, the, assembly, of, all, or, but, of, a, part, when, the, representative, is, one, man, then, is, the, commonwealth, a, monarchy, when, an, assembly, of, all, that, will, come, together, then, it, is, a, democracy, or, popular, commonwealth, when, an, assembly, of, a, part, only, then, it, is, called, an, aristocracy, other, kind, of, commonwealth, there, can, be, none, for, either, one, or, more, or, all, must, have, the, sovereign, power, which, i, have, shown, to, be, indivisible, entire, according, to, yale, professor, juan, jos, linz, there, a, three, main, types, of, political, systems, today, democracies, totalitarian, regimes, and, sitting, between, these, two, authoritarian, regimes, with, hybrid, regimes, another, modern, classification, system, includes, monarchies, as, a, standalone, entity, or, as, a, hybrid, system, of, the, main, three, scholars, generally, refer, to, a, dictatorship, as, either, a, form, of, authoritarianism, or, totalitarianism, an, autocracy, is, a, system, of, government, in, which, supreme, power, is, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, one, person, whose, decisions, are, subject, to, neither, external, legal, restraints, nor, regularized, mechanisms, of, popular, control, except, perhaps, for, the, implicit, threat, of, a, coup, d, tat, or, mass, insurrection, absolute, monarchy, is, a, historically, prevalent, form, of, autocracy, wherein, a, monarch, governs, as, a, singular, sovereign, with, no, limitation, on, royal, prerogative, most, absolute, monarchies, are, hereditary, however, some, notably, the, holy, see, are, elected, by, an, electoral, college, such, as, the, college, of, cardinals, or, prince, electors, other, forms, of, autocracy, include, tyranny, despotism, and, dictatorship, aristocracy, is, a, form, of, government, that, places, power, in, the, hands, of, a, small, elite, ruling, class, such, as, a, hereditary, nobility, or, privileged, caste, this, class, exercises, minority, rule, often, as, a, landed, timocracy, wealthy, plutocracy, or, oligarchy, many, monarchies, were, aristocracies, although, in, modern, constitutional, monarchies, the, monarch, may, have, little, effective, power, the, term, aristocracy, could, also, refer, to, the, non, peasant, non, servant, and, non, city, classes, in, the, feudal, system, democracy, is, a, system, of, government, where, citizens, exercise, power, by, voting, and, deliberation, in, a, direct, democracy, the, citizenry, as, a, whole, directly, forms, a, participatory, governing, body, and, vote, directly, on, each, issue, in, indirect, democracy, the, citizenry, governs, indirectly, through, the, selection, of, representatives, or, delegates, from, among, themselves, typically, by, election, or, less, commonly, by, sortition, these, select, citizens, then, meet, to, form, a, governing, body, such, as, a, legislature, or, jury, some, governments, combine, both, direct, and, indirect, democratic, governance, wherein, the, citizenry, selects, representatives, to, administer, day, to, day, governance, while, also, reserving, the, right, govern, directly, through, popular, initiatives, referendums, plebiscites, and, the, right, of, recall, in, a, constitutional, democracy, the, powers, of, the, majority, are, exercised, within, the, framework, of, a, representative, democracy, but, the, constitution, limits, majority, rule, usually, through, the, provision, by, all, of, certain, universal, rights, such, as, freedom, of, speech, or, freedom, of, association, a, republic, is, a, form, of, government, in, which, the, country, is, considered, a, public, matter, latin, res, publica, not, the, private, concern, or, property, of, the, rulers, and, where, offices, of, states, are, subsequently, directly, or, indirectly, elected, or, appointed, rather, than, inherited, the, people, or, some, significant, portion, of, them, have, supreme, control, over, the, government, and, where, offices, of, state, are, elected, or, chosen, by, elected, people, a, common, simplified, definition, of, a, republic, is, a, government, where, the, head, of, state, is, not, a, monarch, montesquieu, included, both, democracies, where, all, the, people, have, a, share, in, rule, and, aristocracies, or, oligarchies, where, only, some, of, the, people, rule, as, republican, forms, of, government, other, terms, used, to, describe, different, republics, include, democratic, republic, parliamentary, republic, semi, presidential, republic, presidential, republic, federal, republic, people, s, republic, and, islamic, republic, federalism, is, a, political, concept, in, which, a, group, of, members, are, bound, together, by, covenant, with, a, governing, representative, head, the, term, federalism, is, also, used, to, describe, a, system, of, government, in, which, sovereignty, is, constitutionally, divided, between, a, central, governing, authority, and, constituent, political, units, variously, called, states, provinces, or, otherwise, federalism, is, a, system, based, upon, democratic, principles, and, institutions, in, which, the, power, to, govern, is, shared, between, national, and, provincial, state, governments, creating, what, is, often, called, a, federation, proponents, are, often, called, federalists, governments, are, typically, organised, into, distinct, institutions, constituting, branches, of, government, each, with, particular, powers, functions, duties, and, responsibilities, the, distribution, of, powers, between, these, institutions, differs, between, governments, as, do, the, functions, and, number, of, branches, an, independent, parallel, distribution, of, powers, between, branches, of, government, is, the, separation, of, powers, a, shared, intersecting, or, overlapping, distribution, of, powers, is, the, fusion, of, powers, governments, are, often, organised, into, three, branches, with, separate, powers, a, legislature, an, executive, and, a, judiciary, this, is, sometimes, called, the, trias, politica, model, however, in, parliamentary, and, semi, presidential, systems, branches, of, government, often, intersect, having, shared, membership, and, overlapping, functions, many, governments, have, fewer, or, additional, branches, such, as, an, independent, electoral, commission, or, auditory, branch, presently, most, governments, are, administered, by, members, of, an, explicitly, constituted, political, party, which, coordinates, the, activities, of, associated, government, officials, and, candidates, for, office, in, a, multiparty, system, of, government, multiple, political, parties, have, the, capacity, to, gain, control, of, government, offices, typically, by, competing, in, elections, although, the, effective, number, of, parties, may, be, limited, a, majority, government, is, a, government, by, one, or, more, governing, parties, together, holding, an, absolute, majority, of, seats, in, the, parliament, in, contrast, to, a, minority, government, in, which, they, have, only, a, plurality, of, seats, and, often, depend, on, a, confidence, and, supply, arrangement, with, other, parties, a, coalition, government, is, one, in, which, multiple, parties, cooperate, to, form, a, government, as, part, of, a, coalition, agreement, in, a, single, party, government, a, single, party, forms, a, government, without, the, support, of, a, coalition, as, is, typically, the, case, with, majority, governments, but, even, a, minority, government, may, consist, of, just, one, party, unable, to, find, a, willing, coalition, partner, at, the, moment, a, state, that, continuously, maintains, a, single, party, government, within, a, nominally, multiparty, system, possesses, a, dominant, party, system, in, a, nondemocratic, one, party, system, a, single, ruling, party, has, the, more, or, less, exclusive, right, to, form, the, government, and, the, formation, of, other, parties, may, be, obstructed, or, illegal, in, some, cases, a, government, may, have, a, non, partisan, system, as, is, the, case, with, absolute, monarchy, or, non, partisan, democracy, democracy, is, the, most, popular, form, of, government, with, more, than, half, of, the, nations, in, the, world, being, democracies, 97, of, 167, nations, as, of, 2021, however, the, world, is, becoming, more, authoritarian, with, a, quarter, of, the, world, s, population, under, democratically, backsliding, governments
