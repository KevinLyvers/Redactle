northern, berber, kabyle, atlas, zenati, western, berber, eastern, berber, tuareg, the, berber, languages, also, known, as, the, amazigh, languages, or, tamazight, are, a, branch, of, the, afroasiatic, language, family, they, comprise, a, group, of, closely, related, but, mostly, mutually, unintelligible, languages, spoken, by, berber, communities, who, are, indigenous, to, north, africa, the, languages, are, primarily, spoken, and, not, typically, written, historically, they, have, been, written, with, the, ancient, libyco, berber, script, which, now, exists, in, the, form, of, tifinagh, today, they, may, also, be, written, in, the, berber, latin, alphabet, or, the, arabic, script, with, latin, being, the, most, pervasive, the, berber, languages, have, a, similar, level, of, variety, to, the, romance, languages, although, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, single, collective, language, often, as, berber, tamazight, or, amazigh, the, languages, with, a, few, exceptions, form, a, dialect, continuum, there, is, a, debate, as, to, how, to, best, sub, categorize, languages, within, the, berber, branch, berber, languages, typically, follow, verb, subject, object, word, order, their, phonological, inventories, are, diverse, millions, of, people, in, morocco, and, algeria, natively, speak, a, berber, language, as, do, smaller, populations, of, libya, tunisia, northern, mali, western, and, northern, niger, northern, burkina, faso, and, mauritania, and, the, siwa, oasis, of, egypt, there, are, also, likely, a, few, million, speakers, of, berber, languages, in, western, europe, tashlhiyt, kabyle, central, atlas, tamazight, tarifit, and, shawiya, are, some, of, the, most, commonly, spoken, berber, languages, exact, numbers, are, impossible, to, ascertain, as, there, are, few, modern, north, african, censuses, that, include, questions, on, language, use, and, what, censuses, do, exist, have, known, flaws, following, independence, in, the, 20th, century, the, berber, languages, have, been, suppressed, and, suffered, from, low, prestige, in, north, africa, recognition, of, the, berber, languages, has, been, growing, in, the, 21st, century, with, morocco, and, algeria, adding, tamazight, as, an, official, language, to, their, constitutions, in, 2011, and, 2016, respectively, most, berber, languages, have, a, high, percentage, of, borrowing, and, influence, from, the, arabic, language, as, well, as, from, other, languages, for, example, arabic, loanwords, represent, 35, to, 46, of, the, total, vocabulary, of, the, kabyle, language, and, represent, 51, 7, of, the, total, vocabulary, of, tarifit, almost, all, berber, languages, took, from, arabic, the, pharyngeal, fricatives, and, the, nongeminated, uvular, stop, q, and, the, voiceless, pharyngealized, consonant, unlike, the, chadic, cushitic, and, omotic, languages, of, the, afro, asiatic, phylum, berber, languages, are, not, tonal, languages, tamazight, and, berber, languages, are, often, used, interchangeably, however, tamazight, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, a, specific, subset, of, berber, languages, such, as, central, tashlhiyt, tamazight, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, standard, moroccan, tamazight, or, standard, algerian, tamazight, as, in, the, moroccan, and, algerian, constitutions, respectively, in, morocco, besides, referring, to, all, berber, languages, or, to, standard, moroccan, tamazight, tamazight, is, often, used, in, contrast, to, tashelhit, and, tarifit, to, refer, to, central, atlas, tamazight, the, use, of, berber, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, due, to, its, historical, background, as, an, exonym, and, present, equivalence, with, the, arabic, word, for, barbarian, one, group, the, linguasphere, observatory, has, attempted, to, introduce, the, neologism, tamazic, languages, to, refer, to, the, berber, languages, amazigh, people, typically, use, tamazight, when, speaking, english, historically, berbers, did, not, refer, to, themselves, as, berbers, amazigh, but, had, their, own, terms, to, refer, to, themselves, for, example, the, kabyles, use, the, term, leqbayel, to, refer, to, their, own, people, while, the, chaouis, identified, themselves, as, ishawiyen, instead, of, berber, amazigh, since, modern, berber, languages, are, relatively, homogeneous, the, date, of, the, proto, berber, language, from, which, the, modern, group, is, derived, was, probably, comparatively, recent, comparable, to, the, age, of, the, germanic, or, romance, subfamilies, of, the, indo, european, family, in, contrast, the, split, of, the, group, from, the, other, afroasiatic, sub, phyla, is, much, earlier, and, is, therefore, sometimes, associated, with, the, local, mesolithic, capsian, culture, a, number, of, extinct, populations, are, believed, to, have, spoken, afroasiatic, languages, of, the, berber, branch, according, to, peter, behrens, and, marianne, bechaus, gerst, linguistic, evidence, suggests, that, the, peoples, of, the, c, group, culture, in, present, day, southern, egypt, and, northern, sudan, spoke, berber, languages, the, nilo, saharan, nobiin, language, today, contains, a, number, of, key, loanwords, related, to, pastoralism, that, are, of, berber, origin, including, the, terms, for, sheep, and, water, nile, this, in, turn, suggests, that, the, c, group, population, which, along, with, the, kerma, culture, inhabited, the, nile, valley, immediately, before, the, arrival, of, the, first, nubian, speakers, spoke, afroasiatic, languages, berber, languages, are, primarily, oral, languages, without, a, major, written, component, historically, they, were, written, with, the, libyco, berber, script, early, uses, of, the, script, have, been, found, on, rock, art, and, in, various, sepulchres, the, oldest, known, variations, of, the, script, dates, to, inscriptions, in, dugga, from, 600, bc, usage, of, this, script, in, the, form, of, tifinagh, has, continued, into, the, present, day, among, the, tuareg, people, following, the, spread, of, islam, some, berber, scholars, also, utilized, the, arabic, script, the, berber, latin, alphabet, was, developed, following, the, introduction, of, the, latin, script, in, the, nineteenth, century, by, the, west, the, nineteenth, century, also, saw, the, development, of, neo, tifinagh, an, adaptation, of, tuareg, tifinagh, for, use, with, other, berber, languages, there, are, now, three, writing, systems, in, use, for, berber, languages, tifinagh, the, arabic, script, and, the, berber, latin, alphabet, with, the, latin, alphabet, being, the, most, widely, used, today, with, the, exception, of, zenaga, tetserret, and, tuareg, the, berber, languages, form, a, dialect, continuum, different, linguists, take, different, approaches, towards, drawing, boundaries, between, languages, in, this, continuum, maarten, kossmann, notes, that, it, is, difficult, to, apply, the, classic, tree, model, of, historical, linguistics, towards, the, berber, languages, s, continuous, history, of, convergence, and, differentiation, along, new, lines, makes, an, definition, of, branches, arbitrary, moreover, mutual, intelligibility, and, mutual, influence, render, notions, such, as, split, or, branching, rather, difficult, to, apply, except, maybe, in, the, case, of, zenaga, and, tuareg, kossmann, roughly, groups, the, berber, languages, into, seven, blocks, the, zenatic, block, is, typically, divided, into, the, zenati, and, eastern, berber, branches, due, to, the, marked, difference, in, features, at, each, end, of, the, continuum, otherwise, subclassifications, by, different, linguists, typically, combine, various, blocks, into, different, branches, western, moroccan, languages, zenati, languages, kabyle, and, ghadames, may, be, grouped, under, northern, berber, awjila, is, often, included, as, an, eastern, berber, language, alongside, siwa, sokna, and, el, foqaha, these, approaches, divide, the, berber, languages, into, northern, southern, tuareg, eastern, and, western, varieties, the, vast, majority, of, speakers, of, berber, languages, are, concentrated, in, morocco, and, algeria, the, exact, population, of, speakers, has, been, historically, difficult, to, ascertain, due, to, lack, of, official, recognition, morocco, is, the, country, with, the, greatest, number, of, speakers, of, berber, languages, as, of, 2022, ethnologue, estimates, there, to, be, 13, 8, million, speakers, of, berber, languages, in, morocco, based, on, figures, from, 2016, and, 2017, in, 1960, the, first, census, after, moroccan, independence, was, held, it, claimed, that, 32, percent, of, moroccans, spoke, a, berber, language, including, bi, tri, and, quadrilingual, people, the, 2004, census, found, that, 3, 894, 805, moroccans, over, five, years, of, age, spoke, tashelhit, 2, 343, 937, spoke, central, atlas, tamazight, and, 1, 270, 986, spoke, tarifit, representing, 14, 6, 8, 8, and, 4, 8, respectively, of, the, surveyed, population, or, roughly, 28, 2, of, the, surveyed, population, combined, the, 2014, census, found, that, 14, 1, of, the, population, spoke, tashelhit, 7, 9, spoke, central, atlas, tamazight, and, 4, spoke, tarifit, or, about, 26, of, the, population, combined, these, estimates, as, well, as, the, estimates, from, various, academic, sources, are, summarized, as, follows, algeria, is, the, country, with, the, second, greatest, number, of, speakers, of, berber, languages, in, 1906, the, total, population, speaking, berber, languages, in, algeria, excluding, the, thinly, populated, sahara, region, was, estimated, at, 1, 305, 730, out, of, 4, 447, 149, or, 29, secondary, sources, disagree, on, the, percentage, of, self, declared, native, berber, speakers, in, the, 1966, census, the, last, algerian, census, containing, a, question, about, the, mother, tongue, some, give, 17, 9, while, other, report, 19, kabyle, speakers, account, for, the, vast, majority, of, speakers, of, berber, languages, in, algeria, shawiya, is, the, second, most, commonly, spoken, berber, language, in, algeria, other, berber, languages, spoken, in, algeria, include, shenwa, with, 76, 300, speakers, tashelhit, with, 6, 000, speakers, ouargli, with, 20, 000, speakers, tamahaq, with, 71, 400, speakers, tugurt, with, 8, 100, speakers, tidikelt, with, 1, 000, speakers, gurara, with, 11, 000, speakers, and, mozabite, with, 150, 000, speakers, population, estimates, are, summarized, as, follows, as, of, 1998, there, were, an, estimated, 450, 000, tawellemmet, speakers, 250, 000, air, tamajeq, speakers, and, 20, 000, tamahaq, speakers, in, niger, as, of, 2018, and, 2014, respectively, there, were, an, estimated, 420, 000, speakers, of, tawellemmet, and, 378, 000, of, tamasheq, in, mali, as, of, 2022, based, on, figures, from, 2020, ethnologue, estimates, there, to, be, 285, 890, speakers, of, berber, languages, in, libya, 247, 000, speakers, of, nafusi, 22, 800, speakers, of, tamahaq, 13, 400, speakers, of, ghadam, s, and, 2, 690, speakers, of, awjila, the, number, of, siwi, speakers, in, libya, is, listed, as, negligible, and, the, last, sokna, speaker, is, thought, to, have, died, in, the, 1950s, there, are, an, estimated, 50, 000, djerbi, speakers, in, tunisia, based, on, figures, from, 2004, sened, is, likely, extinct, with, the, last, speaker, having, died, in, the, 1970s, ghadam, s, though, not, indigenous, to, tunisia, is, estimated, to, have, 3, 100, speakers, throughout, the, country, chenini, is, one, of, the, rare, remaining, berber, speaking, villages, in, tunisia, there, are, an, estimated, 20, 000, siwi, speakers, in, egypt, based, on, figures, from, 2013, as, of, 2018, and, 2017, respectively, there, were, an, estimated, 200, speakers, of, zenaga, and, 117, 000, of, tamasheq, in, mauritania, as, of, 2009, there, were, an, estimated, 122, 000, tamasheq, speakers, in, burkina, faso, there, are, an, estimated, 1, 5, million, speakers, of, various, berber, languages, in, france, a, small, number, of, tawellemmet, speakers, live, in, nigeria, in, total, there, are, an, estimated, 3, 6, million, speakers, of, berber, languages, in, countries, outside, of, morocco, and, algeria, summarized, as, follows, after, independence, all, the, maghreb, countries, to, varying, degrees, pursued, a, policy, of, arabisation, aimed, partly, at, displacing, french, from, its, colonial, position, as, the, dominant, language, of, education, and, literacy, under, this, policy, the, use, of, the, berber, languages, was, suppressed, or, even, banned, this, state, of, affairs, has, been, contested, by, berbers, in, morocco, and, algeria, especially, kabylie, and, was, addressed, in, both, countries, by, affording, the, language, official, status, and, introducing, it, in, some, schools, after, gaining, independence, from, france, in, 1956, morocco, began, a, period, of, arabisation, through, 1981, with, primary, and, secondary, school, education, gradually, being, changed, to, arabic, instruction, and, with, the, aim, of, having, administration, done, in, arabic, rather, than, french, during, this, time, there, were, riots, amongst, the, amazigh, population, which, called, for, the, inclusion, of, tamazight, as, an, official, language, the, 2000, charter, for, education, reform, marked, a, change, in, policy, with, its, statement, of, openness, to, tamazight, planning, for, a, public, tamazight, language, tv, network, began, in, 2006, in, 2010, the, moroccan, government, launched, tamazight, tv, on, july, 29, 2011, tamazight, was, added, as, an, official, language, to, the, moroccan, constitution, after, gaining, independence, from, france, in, 1962, algeria, committed, to, a, policy, of, arabisation, which, after, the, imposition, of, the, circular, of, july, 1976, encompassed, the, spheres, of, education, public, administration, public, signage, print, publication, and, the, judiciary, while, primarily, directed, towards, the, erasure, of, french, in, algerian, society, these, policies, also, targeted, berber, languages, leading, to, dissatisfaction, and, unrest, amongst, speakers, of, berber, languages, who, made, up, about, one, quarter, of, the, population, after, the, 1994, 1995, general, school, boycott, in, kabylia, tamazight, was, recognized, for, the, first, time, as, a, national, language, in, 2002, following, the, riots, of, the, black, spring, tamazight, was, recognized, for, the, second, time, as, a, national, language, though, not, as, an, official, one, this, was, done, on, april, 8, 2003, tamazight, has, been, taught, for, three, hours, a, week, through, the, first, three, years, of, algerian, middle, schools, since, 2005, on, january, 5, 2016, it, was, announced, that, tamazight, had, been, added, as, a, national, and, official, language, in, a, draft, amendment, to, the, algerian, constitution, it, was, added, to, the, constitution, as, a, national, and, official, language, on, february, 7, 2016, although, regional, councils, in, libya, s, nafusa, mountains, affiliated, with, the, national, transitional, council, reportedly, use, the, berber, language, of, nafusi, and, have, called, for, it, to, be, granted, co, official, status, with, arabic, in, a, prospective, new, constitution, it, does, not, have, official, status, in, libya, as, in, morocco, and, algeria, as, areas, of, libya, south, and, west, of, tripoli, such, as, the, nafusa, mountains, were, taken, from, the, control, of, gaddafi, government, forces, in, early, summer, 2011, berber, workshops, and, exhibitions, sprang, up, to, share, and, spread, the, berber, culture, and, language, in, mali, and, niger, some, tuareg, languages, have, been, recognized, as, national, languages, and, have, been, part, of, school, curriculums, since, the, 1960s, in, linguistics, the, phonology, of, berber, languages, is, written, with, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, with, the, following, exceptions, the, influence, of, arabic, the, process, of, spirantization, and, the, absence, of, labialization, have, caused, the, consonant, systems, of, berber, languages, to, differ, significantly, by, region, berber, languages, found, north, of, and, in, the, northern, half, of, the, sahara, have, greater, influence, from, arabic, including, that, of, loaned, phonemes, than, those, in, more, southern, regions, like, tuareg, most, berber, languages, in, northern, regions, have, additionally, undergone, spirantization, in, which, historical, short, stops, have, changed, into, fricatives, northern, berber, languages, which, is, a, subset, of, but, not, identical, to, berber, languages, in, geographically, northern, regions, commonly, have, labialized, velars, and, uvulars, unlike, other, berber, languages, two, languages, that, illustrate, the, resulting, range, in, consonant, inventory, across, berber, languages, are, ahaggar, tuareg, and, kabyle, kabyle, has, two, more, places, of, articulation, and, three, more, manners, of, articulation, than, ahaggar, tuareg, there, is, still, however, common, consonant, features, observed, across, berber, languages, almost, all, berber, languages, have, bilabial, dental, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and, laryngeal, consonants, and, almost, all, consonants, have, a, long, counterpart, all, berber, languages, as, is, common, in, afroasiatic, languages, have, pharyngealized, consonants, and, phonemic, gemination, the, consonants, which, may, undergo, gemination, and, the, positions, in, a, word, where, gemination, may, occur, differ, by, language, they, have, also, been, observed, to, have, tense, and, lax, consonants, although, the, status, of, tense, consonants, has, been, the, subject, of, considerable, discussion, by, linguists, the, vowel, systems, of, berber, languages, also, vary, widely, with, inventories, ranging, from, three, phonemic, vowels, in, most, northern, berber, languages, to, seven, in, some, eastern, berber, and, tuareg, languages, for, example, taselhiyt, has, the, vowels, i, a, and, u, while, ayer, tuareg, has, the, vowels, i, u, e, o, and, a, contrastive, vowel, length, is, rare, in, berber, languages, tuareg, languages, had, previously, been, reported, to, have, contrastive, vowel, length, but, this, is, no, longer, the, leading, analysis, a, complex, feature, of, berber, vowel, systems, is, the, role, of, central, vowels, which, vary, in, occurrence, and, function, across, languages, there, is, a, debate, as, to, whether, schwa, is, a, proper, phoneme, of, northern, berber, languages, most, berber, languages, phonetic, correspondences, between, berber, languages, are, fairly, regular, some, examples, of, varying, importance, and, regularity, include, and, words, in, various, berber, languages, are, shown, to, demonstrate, these, phonetic, correspondences, as, follows, berber, languages, characteristically, make, frequent, use, of, apophony, in, the, form, of, ablaut, berber, apophony, has, been, historically, analyzed, as, functioning, similarly, to, the, semitic, root, but, this, analysis, has, fallen, out, of, favor, due, to, the, lexical, significance, of, vowels, in, berber, languages, as, opposed, to, their, primarily, grammatical, significance, in, semitic, languages, the, lexical, categories, of, all, berber, languages, are, nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, and, prepositions, with, the, exception, of, a, handful, of, arabic, loanwords, in, most, languages, berber, languages, do, not, have, proper, adjectives, in, northern, and, eastern, berber, languages, adjectives, are, a, subcategory, of, nouns, in, tuareg, relative, clauses, and, stative, verb, forms, are, used, to, modify, nouns, instead, the, gender, number, and, case, of, nouns, as, well, as, the, gender, number, and, person, of, verbs, are, typically, distinguished, through, affixes, arguments, are, described, with, word, order, and, clitics, when, sentences, have, a, verb, they, essentially, follow, verb, subject, object, word, order, although, some, linguists, believe, alternate, descriptors, would, better, categorize, certain, languages, such, as, taqbaylit, berber, languages, have, both, independent, and, dependent, pronouns, both, of, which, distinguish, between, person, and, number, gender, is, also, typically, distinguished, in, the, second, and, third, person, and, sometimes, in, first, person, plural, linguist, maarten, kossmann, divides, pronouns, in, berber, languages, into, three, morphological, groups, when, clitics, precede, or, follow, a, verb, they, are, almost, always, ordered, with, the, indirect, object, first, direct, object, second, and, andative, venitive, deictic, clitic, last, an, example, in, tarifit, is, shown, as, follows, y, w, 3sg, m, give, past, as, 3sg, io, 3sg, m, do, i, ven, y, w, as, i, 3sg, m, give, past, 3sg, io, 3sg, m, do, ven, he, gave, it, to, him, in, this, direction, tarifit, the, allowed, positioning, of, different, kinds, of, clitics, varies, by, language, nouns, are, distinguished, by, gender, number, and, case, in, most, berber, languages, with, gender, being, feminine, or, masculine, number, being, singular, or, plural, and, case, being, in, the, construct, or, free, state, some, arabic, borrowings, in, northern, and, eastern, berber, languages, do, not, accept, these, affixes, they, instead, retain, the, arabic, article, regardless, of, case, and, follow, arabic, patterns, to, express, number, and, gender, gender, can, be, feminine, or, masculine, and, can, be, lexically, determined, or, can, be, used, to, distinguish, qualities, of, the, noun, for, humans, and, higher, animals, such, as, mammals, and, large, birds, gender, distinguishes, sex, whereas, for, objects, and, lesser, animals, such, as, insects, and, lizards, it, distinguishes, size, for, some, nouns, often, fruits, and, vegetables, gender, can, also, distinguish, the, specificity, of, the, noun, the, ways, in, which, gender, is, used, to, distinguish, nouns, is, shown, in, as, follows, with, examples, from, figuig, an, example, of, nouns, with, lexically, determined, gender, are, the, feminine, t, lussi, butter, and, masculine, a, i, buttermilk, in, figuig, mass, nouns, have, lexically, determined, gender, across, berber, languages, most, berber, languages, have, two, cases, which, distinguish, the, construct, state, from, the, free, state, the, construct, state, is, also, called, the, construct, case, relative, case, annexed, state, tat, d, annexion, or, the, nominative, case, the, free, state, tat, libre, is, also, called, the, direct, case, or, accusative, case, when, present, case, is, always, expressed, through, nominal, prefixes, and, initial, vowel, reduction, the, use, of, the, marked, nominative, system, and, constructions, similar, to, split, s, alignment, varies, by, language, eastern, berber, languages, do, not, have, case, number, can, be, singular, or, plural, which, is, marked, with, prefixation, suffixation, and, sometimes, apophony, nouns, usually, are, made, plural, by, one, of, either, suffixation, or, apophony, with, prefixation, applied, independently, specifics, vary, by, language, but, prefixation, typically, changes, singular, a, and, ta, to, plural, i, and, ti, respectively, the, number, of, mass, nouns, are, lexically, determined, for, example, in, multiple, berber, languages, such, as, figuig, a, i, buttermilk, is, singular, while, am, an, water, is, plural, nouns, or, pronouns, optionally, extended, with, genitival, pronominal, affixes, demonstrative, clitics, or, pre, nominal, elements, and, then, further, modified, by, numerals, adjectives, possessive, phrases, or, relative, clauses, can, be, built, into, noun, phrases, possessive, phrases, in, noun, phrases, must, have, a, genitive, proposition, there, are, a, limited, number, of, pre, nominal, elements, which, function, similarly, to, pronoun, syntactic, heads, of, the, noun, phrase, and, which, can, be, categorized, into, three, types, as, follows, verb, bases, are, formed, by, stems, that, are, optionally, extended, by, prefixes, with, mood, aspect, and, negation, applied, with, a, vocalic, scheme, this, form, can, then, be, conjugated, with, affixes, to, agree, with, person, number, and, gender, which, produces, a, word, different, linguists, analyze, and, label, aspects, in, the, berber, languages, very, differently, kossman, roughly, summarizes, the, basic, stems, which, denote, aspect, as, follows, different, languages, may, have, more, stems, and, aspects, or, may, distinguish, within, the, above, categories, stem, formation, can, be, very, complex, with, tuareg, by, some, measures, having, over, two, hundred, identified, conjugation, subtypes, the, aspectual, stems, of, some, classes, of, verbs, in, various, berber, languages, are, shown, as, follows, verb, phrases, are, built, with, verb, morphology, pronominal, and, deictic, clitics, pre, verbal, particles, and,

have, lost, use, of, their, original, numerals, from, three, onwards, due, to, the, influence, of, arabic, tarifit, has, lost, all, except, one, languages, that, may, retain, all, their, original,

unique, intonation, in, the, sentence, precedes, all, other, arguments, in, both, types, verbal, sentences, have, a, finite, verb, and, are, commonly, understood, to, follow, verb, subject, object, word, order, vso, some, linguists, have, proposed, opposing, analyses, of, the, word, order, patterns, in, berber, languages, and, there, has, been, some, support, for, characterizing, taqbaylit, as, discourse, configurational, existential, attributive, and, locational, sentences, in, most, berber, languages, are, expressed, with, non, verbal, sentences, which, have, no, finite, verb, in, these, sentences, the, predicate, follows, the, noun, with, the, predicative, particle, d, sometimes, in, between, two, examples, one, without, and, one, with, a, subject, are, given, from, kabyle, as,

verbal, sentences, may, use, the, verb, meaning, to, be, which, exists, in, all, berber, languages, an, example, from, tarifit, is, given, as, follows, i, ti, i, 3sg, m, be, i, a, here, i, ti, i, a, 3sg, m, be, i, here, he, is, always, here, habitual, tarifit, above, all, in, the, area, of, basic, lexicon, the, berber, languages, are, very, similar, however, the, household, related, vocabulary, in, sedentary, tribes, is, especially, different, from, the, one, found, in, nomadic, ones, whereas, tahaggart, has, only, two, or, three, designations, for, species, of, palm, tree, other, languages, may, have, as, many, as, 200, similar, words, in, contrast, tahaggart, has, a, rich, vocabulary, for, the, description, of, camels, some, loanwords, in, the, berber, languages, can, be, traced, to, pre, roman, times, the, berber, words, te, yne, date, and, a, s, an, loose, woody, tissue, around, the, palm, tree, stem, originate, from, ancient, egyptian, likely, due, to, the, introduction, of, date, palm, cultivation, into, north, africa, from, egypt, around, a, dozen, berber, words, are, probable, phoenician, punic, loanwords, although, the, overall, influence, of, phoenician, punic, on, berber, languages, is, negligible, a, number, of, loanwords, could, be, attributed, to, phoenician, punic, hebrew, or, aramaic, the, similar, vocabulary, between, these, semitic, languages, as, well, as, arabic, is, a, complicating, factor, in, tracing, the, etymology, of, certain, words, words, of, latin, origin, have, been, introduced, into, berber, languages, over, time, maarten, kossman, separates, latin, loanwords, in, berber, languages, into, those, from, during, the, roman, empire, latin, loans, from, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, african, romance, loans, precolonial, non, african, romance, loans, and, colonial, and, post, colonial, romance, loans, it, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, latin, from, african, romance, loans, there, are, about, 40, likely, latin, or, african, romance, loanwords, in, berber, languages, which, tend, to, be, agricultural, terms, religious, terms, terms, related, to, learning, or, words, for, plants, or, useful, objects, use, of, these, terms, varies, by, language, for, example, tuareg, does, not, retain, the, latin, agricultural, terms, which, relate, to, a, form, of, agriculture, not, practiced, by, the, tuareg, people, there, are, some, latin, loans, that, are, only, known, to, be, used, in, shawiya, the, berber, calendar, uses, month, names, derived, from, the, julian, calendar, not, every, language, uses, every, month, for, example, figuig, appears, to, use, only, eight, of, the, months, these, names, may, be, precolonial, non, african, romance, loans, adopted, into, berber, languages, through, arabic, rather, than, from, latin, directly, the, most, influential, external, language, on, the, lexicon, of, berber, languages, is, arabic, maarten, kossmann, calculates, that, 0, 5, of, ghadames, and, awdjila, s, core, vocabularies, and, over, 15, of, ghomara, siwa, and, senhadja, de, sra, r, s, core, vocabularies, are, loans, from, arabic, most, other, berber, languages, loan, from, 6, 15, of, their, core, vocabulary, from, arabic, salem, chaker, estimates, that, arabic, loanwords, represent, 38, of, kabyle, vocabulary, 25, of, tashelhiyt, vocabulary, and, 5, of, tuareg, vocabulary, including, non, core, words, on, the, one, hand, the, words, and, expressions, connected, to, islam, were, borrowed, e, g, tashlhiyt, bismillah, in, the, name, of, allah, classical, arabic, bi, smi,

expressions, such, as, the, arabic, greeting, as, sal, mu, alaikum, peace, be, upon, you, were, adopted, tuareg, sal, mu, l, kum, the, berber, languages, have, influenced, local, arabic, dialects, in, the, maghreb, although, maghrebi, arabic, has, a, predominantly, semitic, and, arabic, vocabulary, it, contains, a, few, berber, loanwords, which, represent, 2, 3, of, the, vocabulary, of, libyan, arabic, 8, 9, of, algerian, arabic, and, tunisian, arabic, and, 10, 15, of, moroccan, arabic, their, influence, is, also, seen, in, some, languages, in, west, africa, f, w, h, migeod, pointed, to, strong, resemblances, between, berber, and, hausa, in, such, words, and, phrases, as, these, in, addition, he, notes, that, the, genitive, in, both, languages, is, formed, with, n, of, though, likely, a, common, inheritance, from, proto, afro, asiatic, cf, a, eg, genitive, n, a, number, of, extinct, populations, are, believed, to, have, spoken, afro, asiatic, languages, of, the, berber, branch, according, to, peter, behrens, 1981, and, marianne, bechaus, gerst, 2000, linguistic, evidence, suggests, that, the, peoples, of, the, c, group, culture, in, present, day, southern, egypt, and, northern, sudan, spoke, berber, languages, the, nilo, saharan, nobiin, language, today, contains, a, number, of, key, pastoralism, related, loanwords, that, are, of, berber, origin, including, the, terms, for, sheep, and, water, nile, this, in, turn, suggests, that, the, c, group, population, which, along, with, the, kerma, culture, inhabited, the, nile, valley, immediately, before, the, arrival, of, the, first, nubian, speakers, spoke, afro, asiatic, languages, additionally, historical, linguistics, indicate, that, the, guanche, language, which, was, spoken, on, the, canary, islands, by, the, ancient, guanches, likely, belonged, to, the, berber, branch, of, the, afro, asiatic, family
