council, of, europe, also, use, german, and, italian, for, some, of, their, work, in, a, speech, in, 1929, french, foreign, minister, aristide, briand, floated, the, idea, of, an, organisation, which, would, gather, european, nations, together, in, a, federal, union, to, resolve, common, problems, the, united, kingdom, s, wartime, prime, minister, winston, churchill, first, publicly, suggested, the, creation, of, a, council, of, europe, in, a, bbc, radio, broadcast, on, 21, march, 1943, while, the, second, world, war, was, still, raging, in, his, own, words, he, tried, to, peer, through, the, mists, of, the, future, to, the, end, of, the, war, and, think, about, how, to, rebuild, and, maintain, peace, on, a, shattered, continent, given, that, europe, had, been, at, the, origin, of, two, world, wars, the, creation, of, such, a, body, would, be, he, suggested, a, stupendous, business, he, returned, to, the, idea, during, a, well, known, speech, at, the, university, of, zurich, on, 19, september, 1946, throwing, the, full, weight, of, his, considerable, post, war, prestige, behind, it, additionally, there, were, also, many, other, statesmen, and, politicians, across, the, continent, many, of, them, members, of, the, european, movement, who, were, quietly, working, towards, the, creation, of, the, council, some, regarded, it, as, a, guarantee, that, the, horrors, of, war, or, the, human, rights, violations, of, the, nazi, regime, could, never, again, be, visited, on, the, continent, others, came, to, see, it, as, a, club, of, democracies, built, around, a, set, of, common, values, that, could, stand, as, a, bulwark, against, totalitarian, states, belonging, to, the, eastern, bloc, others, again, saw, it, as, a, nascent, united, states, of, europe, the, resonant, phrase, that, churchill, had, reached, for, at, zurich, in, 1946, the, future, structure, of, the, council, of, europe, was, discussed, at, the, congress, of, europe, which, brought, together, several, hundred, leading, politicians, government, representatives, and, members, of, civil, society, in, the, hague, netherlands, in, 1948, responding, to, the, conclusions, of, the, congress, of, europe, the, consultative, council, of, the, treaty, of, brussels, convened, a, committee, for, the, study, of, european, unity, which, met, eight, times, from, november, 1948, to, january, 1949, to, draw, up, the, blueprint, of, a, new, broad, based, european, organisation, there, were, two, competing, schools, of, thought, some, favoured, a, classical, international, organisation, with, representatives, of, governments, while, others, preferred, a, political, forum, with, parliamentarians, both, approaches, were, finally, combined, through, the, creation, of, a, committee, of, ministers, in, which, governments, were, represented, and, a, consultative, assembly, in, which, parliaments, were, represented, the, two, main, bodies, mentioned, in, the, statute, of, the, council, of, europe, this, dual, intergovernmental, and, inter, parliamentary, structure, was, later, copied, for, the, european, communities, nato, and, osce, the, council, of, europe, was, signed, into, existence, on, 5, may, 1949, by, the, treaty, of, london, the, organisation, s, founding, statute, which, set, out, the, three, basic, values, that, should, guide, its, work, democracy, human, rights, and, the, rule, of, law, it, was, signed, in, london, on, that, day, by, ten, states, belgium, denmark, france, ireland, italy, luxembourg, the, netherlands, norway, sweden, and, the, united, kingdom, though, turkey, and, greece, joined, three, months, later, on, 10, august, 1949, 100, members, of, the, council, s, consultative, assembly, parliamentarians, drawn, from, the, twelve, member, nations, met, in, strasbourg, for, its, first, plenary, session, held, over, 18, sittings, and, lasting, nearly, a, month, they, debated, how, to, reconcile, and, reconstruct, a, continent, still, reeling, from, war, yet, already, facing, a, new, east, west, divide, launched, the, radical, concept, of, a, trans, national, court, to, protect, the, basic, human, rights, of, every, citizen, and, took, the, first, steps, in, a, process, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, creation, of, an, offshoot, organisation, the, european, union, in, august, 1949, paul, henri, spaak, resigned, as, belgium, s, foreign, minister, in, order, to, be, elected, as, the, first, president, of, the, assembly, behind, the, scenes, he, too, had, been, quietly, working, towards, the, creation, of, the, council, and, played, a, key, role, in, steering, its, early, work, however, in, december, 1951, after, nearly, three, years, in, the, role, spaak, resigned, in, disappointment, after, the, assembly, rejected, proposals, for, a, european, political, authority, convinced, that, the, council, of, europe, was, never, going, to, be, in, a, position, to, achieve, his, long, term, goal, of, a, unified, europe, he, soon, tried, again, in, a, new, and, more, promising, format, based, this, time, on, economic, integration, becoming, one, of, the, founders, of, the, european, union, there, was, huge, enthusiasm, for, the, council, of, europe, in, its, early, years, as, its, pioneers, set, about, drafting, what, was, to, become, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, a, charter, of, individual, rights, which, it, was, hoped, no, member, government, could, ever, again, violate, they, drew, in, part, on, the, tenets, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, signed, only, a, few, months, earlier, in, paris, but, crucially, where, the, universal, declaration, was, essentially, aspirational, the, european, convention, from, the, beginning, featured, an, enforcement, mechanism, an, international, court, which, was, to, adjudicate, on, alleged, violations, of, its, articles, and, to, hold, governments, to, account, a, dramatic, leap, forward, for, international, justice, today, this, is, the, european, court, of, human, rights, whose, rulings, are, binding, on, 46, european, nations, the, most, far, reaching, system, of, international, justice, anywhere, in, the, world, one, of, the, council, s, first, acts, was, to, welcome, west, germany, into, its, fold, on, 2, may, 1951, setting, a, pattern, of, post, war, reconciliation, that, was, to, become, a, hallmark, of, the, council, and, beginning, a, long, process, of, enlargement, which, was, to, see, the, organisation, grow, from, its, original, ten, founding, member, states, to, the, 46, nations, that, make, up, the, council, of, europe, today, iceland, had, already, joined, in, 1950, followed, in, 1956, by, austria, cyprus, in, 1961, switzerland, in, 1963, and, malta, in, 1965, in, 2018, an, archive, of, all, speeches, made, to, the, pace, by, heads, of, state, or, government, since, the, council, of, europe, s, creation, in, 1949, appeared, online, the, fruit, of, a, two, year, project, entitled, voices, of, europe, at, the, time, of, its, launch, the, archive, comprised, 263, speeches, delivered, over, a, 70, year, period, by, some, 216, presidents, prime, ministers, monarchs, and, religious, leaders, from, 45, countries, though, it, continues, to, expand, as, new, speeches, are, added, every, few, months, some, very, early, speeches, by, individuals, considered, to, be, founding, figures, of, the, european, institutions, even, if, they, were, not, heads, of, state, or, government, at, the, time, are, also, included, such, as, sir, winston, churchill, or, robert, schuman, addresses, by, eight, monarchs, appear, in, the, list, such, as, king, juan, carlos, i, of, spain, king, albert, ii, of, belgium, and, grand, duke, henri, of, luxembourg, as, well, as, the,

of, europe, being, the, geographically, wider, circle, the, european, union, could, be, seen, as, the, smaller, circle, with, a, much, higher, level, of, integration, through, the, transfer, of,
