colonialism, is, the, pursuing, establishing, and, maintaining, of, control, and, exploitation, of, people, and, of, resources, by, a, foreign, group, colonizers, monopolize, political, power, and, hold, conquered, societies, and, their, people, to, be, inferior, to, their, conquerors, in, legal, administrative, social, cultural, or, biological, terms, while, frequently, advanced, as, an, imperialist, regime, colonialism, can, also, take, the, form, of, settler, colonialism, whereby, colonial, settlers, invade, and, occupy, territory, to, permanently, replace, an, existing, society, with, that, of, the, colonizers, possibly, towards, a, genocide, of, native, populations, colonialism, developed, as, a, concept, describing, european, colonial, empires, of, the, modern, era, which, spread, globally, from, the, 15th, century, to, the, mid, 20th, century, spanning, 35, of, earth, s, land, by, 1800, and, peaking, at, 84, by, the, beginning, of, world, war, i, european, colonialism, employed, mercantilism, and, chartered, companies, and, established, coloniality, which, keeps, the, colonized, socio, economically, othered, and, subaltern, through, modern, biopolitics, of, sexuality, gender, race, disability, and, class, among, others, resulting, in, intersectional, violence, and, discrimination, colonialism, has, been, justified, with, beliefs, of, having, a, civilizing, mission, to, cultivate, land, and, life, based, on, beliefs, of, entitlement, and, superiority, historically, often, rooted, in, the, belief, of, a, christian, mission, because, of, this, broad, impact, different, instances, of, colonialism, have, been, identified, from, around, the, world, and, in, history, starting, with, when, colonization, was, developed, by, developing, colonies, and, metropoles, the, base, colonial, separation, and, characteristic, decolonization, which, started, in, the, 18th, century, gradually, in, waves, led, to, the, independence, of, colonies, with, a, particular, large, wave, of, decolonizations, happening, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, between, 1945, and, 1975, colonialism, has, a, persistent, impact, on, a, wide, range, of, modern, outcomes, as, scholars, have, shown, that, variations, in, colonial, institutions, can, account, for, variations, in, economic, development, regime, types, and, state, capacity, some, academics, have, used, the, term, neocolonialism, to, describe, the, continuation, or, imposition, of, elements, of, colonial, rule, through, indirect, means, in, the, contemporary, period, colonialism, is, etymologically, rooted, in, the, latin, word, colonus, which, was, used, to, describe, tenant, farmers, in, the, roman, empire, the, coloni, sharecroppers, started, as, tenants, of, landlords, but, as, the, system, evolved, they, became, permanently, indebted, to, the, landowner, and, trapped, in, servitude, the, earliest, uses, of, colonialism, referred, to, plantations, that, men, emigrated, to, and, settled, the, term, expanded, its, meaning, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, primarily, refer, to, european, imperial, expansion, and, the, imperial, subjection, of, asian, and, african, peoples, collins, english, dictionary, defines, colonialism, as, the, practice, by, which, a, powerful, country, directly, controls, less, powerful, countries, and, uses, their, resources, to, increase, its, own, power, and, wealth, webster, s, encyclopedic, dictionary, defines, colonialism, as, the, system, or, policy, of, a, nation, seeking, to, extend, or, retain, its, authority, over, other, people, or, territories, the, merriam, webster, dictionary, offers, four, definitions, including, something, characteristic, of, a, colony, and, control, by, one, power, over, a, dependent, area, or, people, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, uses, the, term, to, describe, the, process, of, european, settlement, and, political, control, over, the, rest, of, the, world, including, the, americas, australia, and, parts, of, africa, and, asia, it, discusses, the, distinction, between, colonialism, imperialism, and, conquest, and, states, that, he, difficulty, of, defining, colonialism, stems, from, the, fact, that, the, term, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, imperialism, both, colonialism, and, imperialism, were, forms, of, conquest, that, were, expected, to, benefit, europe, economically, and, strategically, and, continues, given, the, difficulty, of, consistently, distinguishing, between, the, two, terms, this, entry, will, use, colonialism, broadly, to, refer, to, the, project, of, european, political, domination, from, the, sixteenth, to, the, twentieth, centuries, that, ended, with, the, national, liberation, movements, of, the, 1960s, in, his, preface, to, j, rgen, osterhammel, s, colonialism, a, theoretical, overview, roger, tignor, says, for, osterhammel, the, essence, of, colonialism, is, the, existence, of, colonies, which, are, by, definition, governed, differently, from, other, territories, such, as, protectorates, or, informal, spheres, of, influence, in, the, book, osterhammel, asks, how, can, colonialism, be, defined, independently, from, colony, he, settles, on, a, three, sentence, definition, colonialism, is, a, relationship, between, an, indigenous, or, forcibly, imported, majority, and, a, minority, of, foreign, invaders, the, fundamental, decisions, affecting, the, lives, of, the, colonised, people, are, made, and, implemented, by, the, colonial, rulers, in, pursuit, of, interests, that, are, often, defined, in, a, distant, metropolis, rejecting, cultural, compromises, with, the, colonised, population, the, colonisers, are, convinced, of, their, own, superiority, and, their, ordained, mandate, to, rule, according, to, julian, go, colonialism, refers, to, the, direct, political, control, of, a, society, and, its, people, by, a, foreign, ruling, state, the, ruling, state, monopolizes, political, power, and, keeps, the, subordinated, society, and, its, people, in, a, legally, inferior, position, he, also, writes, colonialism, depends, first, and, foremost, upon, the, declaration, of, sovereignty, and, or, territorial, seizure, by, a, core, state, over, another, territory, and, its, inhabitants, who, are, classified, as, inferior, subjects, rather, than, equal, citizens, according, to, david, strang, decolonization, is, achieved, through, the, attainment, of, sovereign, statehood, with, de, jure, recognition, by, the, international, community, or, through, full, incorporation, into, an, existing, sovereign, state, the, times, once, quipped, that, there, were, three, types, of, colonial, empire, the, english, which, consists, in, making, colonies, with, colonists, the, german, which, collects, colonists, without, colonies, the, french, which, sets, up, colonies, without, colonists, modern, studies, of, colonialism, have, often, distinguished, between, various, overlapping, categories, of, colonialism, broadly, classified, into, four, types, settler, colonialism, exploitation, colonialism, surrogate, colonialism, and, internal, colonialism, some, historians, have, identified, other, forms, of, colonialism, including, national, and, trade, forms, when, colonists, settled, in, pre, populated, areas, the, societies, and, cultures, of, the, people, in, those, areas, permanently, changed, colonial, practices, directly, and, indirectly, forced, the, colonized, peoples, to, abandon, their, traditional, cultures, for, example, european, colonizers, in, the, united, states, implemented, the, residential, schools, program, to, force, native, children, to, assimilate, into, the, hegemonic, culture, cultural, colonialism, gave, rise, to, culturally, and, ethnically, mixed, populations, such, as, the, mestizos, of, the, americas, as, well, as, racially, divided, populations, such, as, those, found, in, french, algeria, or, in, southern, rhodesia, in, fact, everywhere, where, colonial, powers, established, a, consistent, and, continued, presence, hybrid, communities, existed, notable, examples, in, asia, include, the, anglo, burmese, anglo, indian, burgher, eurasian, singaporean, filipino, mestizo, kristang, and, macanese, peoples, in, the, dutch, east, indies, later, indonesia, the, vast, majority, of, dutch, settlers, were, in, fact, eurasians, known, as, indo, europeans, formally, belonging, to, the, european, legal, class, in, the, colony, activity, that, could, be, called, colonialism, has, a, long, history, starting, at, least, as, early, as, the, ancient, egyptians, phoenicians, greeks, and, romans, founded, colonies, in, antiquity, phoenicia, had, an, enterprising, maritime, trading, culture, that, spread, across, the, mediterranean, from, 1550, bc, to, 300, bc, later, the, persian, empire, and, various, greek, city, states, continued, on, this, line, of, setting, up, colonies, the, romans, would, soon, follow, setting, up, coloniae, throughout, the, mediterranean, in, north, africa, and, in, western, asia, beginning, in, the, 7th, century, arabs, colonized, a, substantial, portion, of, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, parts, of, asia, and, europe, from, the, 9th, century, vikings, norsemen, such, as, leif, erikson, established, colonies, in, britain, ireland, iceland, greenland, north, america, present, day, russia, and, ukraine, france, normandy, and, sicily, in, the, 9th, century, a, new, wave, of, mediterranean, colonisation, began, with, competitors, such, as, the, venetians, genovese, and, amalfians, infiltrating, the, wealthy, previously, byzantine, or, eastern, roman, islands, and, lands, european, crusaders, set, up, colonial, regimes, in, outremer, in, the, levant, 1097, 1291, and, in, the, baltic, littoral, 12th, century, onwards, venice, began, to, dominate, dalmatia, and, reached, its, greatest, nominal, colonial, extent, at, the, conclusion, of, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, with, the, declaration, of, the, acquisition, of, three, octaves, of, the, byzantine, empire, the, european, early, modern, period, began, with, the, turkish, colonization, of, anatolia, after, the, ottoman, empire, colonialised, constantinople, in, 1453, the, sea, routes, discovered, by, portuguese, prince, henry, the, navigator, 1394, 1460, became,

extents, of, land, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, divided, the, areas, of, these, new, lands, between, the, spanish, empire, and, the, portuguese, empire, in, 1494, the, 17th, century, saw, the, birth, of, the, dutch, empire, and, french, colonial, empire, as, well, as, the, english, overseas, possessions, which, later, became, the, british, empire, it, also, saw, the, establishment, of, danish, overseas, colonies, and, swedish, overseas, colonies, a, first, wave, of, separatism, started, with, the, american, revolutionary, war, 1775, 1783, initiating, the, rise, of, the, second, british, empire, 1783, 1815, the, spanish, empire, largely, collapsed, in, the, americas, with, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, 1808, 1833, empire, builders, established, several, new, colonies, after, this, time, including, in, the, german, colonial, empire, and, belgian, colonial, empire, starting, with, the, end, of, the, french, revolution, european, authors, such, as, johann, gottfried, herder, august, von, kotzebue, and, heinrich, von, kleist, prolifically, published, so, as, to, conjure, up, sympathy, for, the, oppressed, native, peoples, and, the, slaves, of, the, new, world, thereby, starting, the, idealization, of, native, humans, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, russian, empire, and, the, ottoman, empire, existed, at, the, same, time, but, did, not, expand, over, oceans, rather, these, empires, expanded, through, the, conquest, of, neighbouring, territories, there, was, though, some, russian, colonization, of, north, america, across, the, bering, strait, from, the, 1860s, onwards, the, empire, of, japan, modelled, itself, on, european, colonial, empires, and, expanded, its, territories, in, the, pacific, and, on, the, asian, mainland, the, empire, of, brazil, fought, for, hegemony, in, south, america, the, united, states, gained, overseas, territories, after, the, 1898, spanish, american, war, hence, the, coining, of, the, term, american, imperialism, in, the, late, 19th, century, many, european, powers, became, involved, in, the, scramble, for, africa, the, world, s, colonial, population, at, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, 1914, a, high, point, for, colonialism, totalled, about, 560, million, people, of, whom, 70, lived, in, british, possessions, 10, in, french, possessions, 9, in, dutch, possessions, 4, in, japanese, possessions, 2, in, german, possessions, 2, in, american, possessions, 3, in, portuguese, possessions, 1, in, belgian, possessions, and, 0, 5, in, italian, possessions, the, domestic, domains, of, the, colonial, powers, had, a, total, population, of, about, 370, million, people, outside, europe, few, areas, had, remained, without, coming, under, formal, colonial, tutorship, and, even, siam, china, japan, nepal, afghanistan, persia, and, abyssinia, had, felt, varying, degrees, of, western, colonial, style, influence, concessions, unequal, treaties, extraterritoriality, and, the, like, asking, whether, colonies, paid, economic, historian, grover, clark, 1891, 1938, argues, an, emphatic, no, he, reports, that, in, every, case, the, support, cost, especially, the, military, system, necessary, to, support, and, defend, colonies, outran, the, total, trade, they, produced, apart, from, the, british, empire, they, did, not, provide, favoured, destinations, for, the, immigration, of, surplus, metropole, populations, the, question, of, whether, colonies, paid, is, a, complicated, one, when, recognizing, the, multiplicity, of, interests, involved, in, some, cases, colonial, powers, paid, a, lot, in, military, costs, while, private, investors, pocketed, the, benefits, in, other, cases, the, colonial, powers, managed, to, move, the, burden, of, administrative, costs, to, the, colonies, themselves, by, imposing, taxes, after, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, the, victorious, allies, divided, up, the, german, colonial, empire, and, much, of, the, ottoman, empire, between, themselves, as, league, of, nations, mandates, grouping, these, territories, into, three, classes, according, to, how, quickly, it, was, deemed, that, they, could, prepare, for, independence, the,

major, colonial, powers, and, they, quickly, lost, control, of, colonies, such, as, singapore, india, and, libya, in, addition, the, united, nations, shows, support, for, decolonisation, in, its, 1945, charter, in, 1960, the, un, issued, the, declaration, on, the, granting, of, independence, to, colonial, countries, and, peoples, which, affirmed, its, stance, though, notably, colonial, empires, such, as, france, spain, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, abstained, the, word, neocolonialism, originated, from, jean, paul, sartre, in, 1956, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, contexts, since, the, decolonisation, that, took, place, after, world, war, ii, generally, it, does, not, refer, to, a, type, of, direct, colonisation, rather, to, colonialism, or, colonial, style, exploitation, by, other, means, specifically, neocolonialism, may, refer, to, the, theory, that, former, or, existing, economic, relationships, such, as, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, and, the, central, american, free, trade, agreement, or, the, operations, of, companies, such, as, royal, dutch, shell, in, nigeria, and, brunei, fostered, by, former, colonial, powers, were, or, are, used, to, maintain, control, of, former, colonies, and, dependencies, after, the, colonial, independence, movements, of, the, post, world, war, ii, period, the, term, neocolonialism, became, popular, in, ex, colonies, in, the, late, 20th, century, while, colonies, of, contiguous, empires, have, been, historically, excluded, they, can, be, seen, as, colonies, contemporary, expansion, of, colonies, is, seen, by, some, in, case, of, russian, imperialism, and, chinese, imperialism, there, is, also, ongoing, debate, in, academia, about, zionism, as, settler, colonialism, the, impacts, of, colonisation, are, immense, and, pervasive, various, effects, both, immediate, and, protracted, include, the, spread, of, virulent, diseases, unequal, social, relations, detribalization, exploitation, enslavement, medical, advances, the, creation, of, new, institutions, abolitionism, improved, infrastructure, and, technological, progress, colonial, practices, also, spur, the, spread, of, conquerors, languages, literature, and, cultural, institutions, while, endangering, or, obliterating, those, of, indigenous, peoples, the, cultures, of, the, colonised, peoples, can, also, have, a, powerful, influence, on, the, imperial, country, with, respect, to, international, borders, britain, and, france, traced, close, to, 40, of, the, entire, length, of, the, world, s, international, boundaries, economic, expansion, sometimes, described, as, the, colonial, surplus, has, accompanied, imperial, expansion, since, ancient, times, greek, trade, networks, spread, throughout, the, mediterranean, region, while, roman, trade, expanded, with, the, primary, goal, of, directing, tribute, from, the, colonised, areas, towards, the, roman, metropole, according, to, strabo, by, the, time, of, emperor, augustus, up, to, 120, roman, ships, would, set, sail, every, year, from, myos, hormos, in, roman, egypt, to, india, with, the, development, of, trade, routes, under, the, ottoman, empire, gujari, hindus, syrian, muslims, jews, armenians, christians, from, south, and, central, europe, operated, trading, routes, that, supplied, persian, and, arab, horses, to, the, armies, of, all, three, empires, mocha, coffee, to, delhi, and, belgrade, persian, silk, to, india, and, istanbul, aztec, civilisation, developed, into, an, extensive, empire, that, much, like, the, roman, empire, had, the, goal, of, exacting, tribute, from, the, conquered, colonial, areas, for, the, aztecs, a, significant, tribute, was, the, acquisition, of, sacrificial, victims, for, their, religious, rituals, on, the, other, hand, european, colonial, empires, sometimes, attempted, to, channel, restrict, and, impede, trade, involving, their, colonies, funneling, activity, through, the, metropole, and, taxing, accordingly, despite, the, general, trend, of, economic, expansion, the, economic, performance, of, former, european, colonies, varies, significantly, in, institutions, as, a, fundamental, cause, of, long, run, growth, economists, daron, acemoglu, simon, johnson, and, james, a, robinson, compare, the, economic, influences, of, the, european, colonists, on, different, colonies, and, study, what, could, explain, the, huge, discrepancies, in, previous, european, colonies, for, example, between, west, african, colonies, like, sierra, leone, and, hong, kong, and, singapore, according, to, the, paper, economic, institutions, are, the, determinant, of, the, colonial, success, because, they, determine, their, financial, performance, and, order, for, the, distribution, of, resources, at, the, same, time, these, institutions, are, also, consequences, of, political, institutions, especially, how, de, facto, and, de, jure, political, power, is, allocated, to, explain, the, different, colonial, cases, we, thus, need, to, look, first, into, the, political, institutions, that, shaped, the, economic, institutions, for, example, one, interesting, observation, is, the, reversal, of, fortune, the, less, developed, civilisations, in, 1500, like, north, america, australia, and, new, zealand, are, now, much, richer, than, those, countries, who, used, to, be, in, the, prosperous, civilisations, in, 1500, before, the, colonists, came, like, the, mughals, in, india, and, the, incas, in, the, americas, one, explanation, offered, by, the, paper, focuses, on, the, political, institutions, of, the, various, colonies, it, was, less, likely, for, european, colonists, to, introduce, economic, institutions, where, they, could, benefit, quickly, from, the, extraction, of, resources, in, the, area, therefore, given, a, more, developed, civilisation, and, denser, population, european, colonists, would, rather, keep, the, existing, economic, systems, than, introduce, an, entirely, new, system, while, in, places, with, little, to, extract, european, colonists, would, rather, establish, new, economic, institutions, to, protect, their, interests, political, institutions, thus, gave, rise, to, different, types, of, economic, systems, which, determined, the, colonial, economic, performance, european, colonisation, and, development, also, changed, gendered, systems, of, power, already, in, place, around, the, world, in, many, pre, colonialist, areas, women, maintained, power, prestige, or, authority, through, reproductive, or, agricultural, control, for, example, in, certain, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, women, maintained, farmland, in, which, they, had, usage, rights, while, men, would, make, political, and, communal, decisions, for, a, community, the, women, would, control, the, village, s, food, supply, or, their, individual, family, s, land, this, allowed, women, to, achieve, power, and, autonomy, even, in, patrilineal, and, patriarchal, societies, through, the, rise, of, european, colonialism, came, a, large, push, for, development, and, industrialisation, of, most, economic, systems, when, working, to, improve, productivity, europeans, focused, mostly, on, male, workers, foreign, aid, arrived, in, the, form, of, loans, land, credit, and, tools, to, speed, up, development, but, were, only, allocated, to, men, in, a, more, european, fashion, women, were, expected, to, serve, on, a, more, domestic, level, the, result, was, a, technologic, economic, and, class, based, gender, gap, that, widened, over, time, within, a, colony, the, presence, of, extractive, colonial, institutions, in, a, given, area, has, been, found, have, effects, on, the, modern, day, economic, development, institutions, and, infrastructure, of, these, areas, european, nations, entered, their, imperial, projects, with, the, goal, of, enriching, the, european, metropoles, exploitation, of, non, europeans, and, of, other, europeans, to, support, imperial, goals, was, acceptable, to, the, colonisers, two, outgrowths, of, this, imperial, agenda, were, the, extension, of, slavery, and, indentured, servitude, in, the, 17th, century, nearly, two, thirds, of, english, settlers, came, to, north, america, as, indentured, servants, european, slave, traders, brought, large, numbers, of, african, slaves, to, the, americas, by, sail, spain, and, portugal, had, brought, african, slaves, to, work, in, african, colonies, such, as, cape, verde, and, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, and, then, in, latin, america, by, the, 16th, century, the, british, french, and, dutch, joined, in, the, slave, trade, in, subsequent, centuries, the, european, colonial, system, took, approximately, 11, million, africans, to, the, caribbean, and, to, north, and, south, america, as, slaves, abolitionists, in, europe, and, americas, protested, the, inhumane, treatment, of, african, slaves, which, led, to, the, elimination, of, the, slave, trade, and, later, of, most, forms, of, slavery, by, the, late, 19th, century, one, disputed, school, of, thought, points, to, the, role, of, abolitionism, in, the, american, revolution, while, the, british, colonial, metropole, started, to, move, towards, outlawing, slavery, slave, owning, elites, in, the, thirteen, colonies, saw, this, as, one, of, the, reasons, to, fight, for, their, post, colonial, independence, and, for, the, right, to, develop, and, continue, a, largely, slave, based, economy, british, colonising, activity, in, new, zealand, from, the, early, 19th, century, played, a, part, in, ending, slave, taking, and, slave, keeping, among, the, indigenous, m, ori, on, the, other, hand, british, colonial, administration, in, southern, africa, when, it, officially, abolished, slavery, in, the, 1830s, caused, rifts, in, society, which, arguably, perpetuated, slavery, in, the, boer, republics, and, fed, into, the, philosophy, of, apartheid, the, labour, shortages, that, resulted, from, abolition, inspired, european, colonisers, in, queensland, british, guaiana, and, fiji, for, example, to, develop, new, sources, of, labour, re, adopting, a, system, of, indentured, servitude, indentured, servants, consented, to, a, contract, with, the, european, colonisers, under, their, contract, the, servant, would, work, for, an, employer, for, a, term, of, at, least, a, year, while, the, employer, agreed, to, pay, for, the, servant, s, voyage, to, the, colony, possibly, pay, for, the, return, to, the, country, of, origin, and, pay, the, employee, a, wage, as, well, the, employees, became, indentured, to, the, employer, because, they, owed, a, debt, back, to, the, employer, for, their, travel, expense, to, the, colony, which, they, were, expected, to, pay, through, their, wages, in, practice, indentured, servants, were, exploited, through, terrible, working, conditions, and, burdensome, debts, imposed, by, the, employers, with, whom, the, servants, had, no, means, of, negotiating, the, debt, once, they, arrived, in, the, colony, india, and, china, were, the, largest, source, of, indentured, servants, during, the, colonial, era, indentured, servants, from, india, travelled, to, british, colonies, in, asia, africa, and, the, caribbean, and, also, to, french, and, portuguese, colonies, while, chinese, servants, travelled, to, british, and, dutch, colonies, between, 1830, and, 1930, around, 30, million, indentured, servants, migrated, from, india, and, 24, million, returned, to, india, china, sent, more, indentured, servants, to, european, colonies, and, around, the, same, proportion, returned, to, china, following, the, scramble, for, africa, an, early, but, secondary, focus, for, most, colonial, regimes, was, the, suppression, of, slavery, and, the, slave, trade, by, the, end, of, the, colonial, period, they, were, mostly, successful, in, this, aim, though, slavery, persists, in, africa, and, in, the, world, at, large, with, much, the, same, practices, of, de, facto, servility, despite, legislative, prohibition, conquering, forces, have, throughout, history, applied, innovation, in, order, to, gain, an, advantage, over, the, armies, of, the, people, they, aim, to, conquer, greeks, developed, the, phalanx, system, which, enabled, their, military, units, to, present, themselves, to, their,

colonial, botany, refers, to, the, body, of, works, concerning, the, study, cultivation, marketing, and, naming, of, the, new, plants, that, were, acquired, or, traded, during, the, age, of, european, colonialism, notable, examples, of, these, plants, included, sugar, nutmeg, tobacco, cloves, cinnamon, peruvian, bark, peppers, sassafras, albidum, and, tea, this, work, was, a, large, part, of, securing, financing, for, colonial, ambitions, supporting, european, expansion, and, ensuring, the, profitability, of, such, endeavors, vasco, de, gama, and, christopher, columbus, were, seeking, to, establish, routes, to, trade, spices, dyes, and, silk, from, the, moluccas, india, and, china, by, sea, that, would, be, independent, of, the, established, routes, controlled, by, venetian, and, middle, eastern, merchants, naturalists, like, hendrik, van, rheede, georg, eberhard, rumphius, and, jacobus, bontius, compiled, data, about, eastern, plants, on, behalf, of, the, europeans, though, sweden, did, not, possess, an, extensive, colonial, network, botanical, research, based, on, carl, linnaeus, identified, and, developed, techniques, to, grow, cinnamon, tea, and, rice, locally, as, an, alternative, to, costly, imports, settlers, acted, as, the, link, between, indigenous, populations, and, the, imperial, hegemony, thus, bridging, the, geographical, ideological, and, commercial, gap, between, the, colonisers, and, colonised, while, the, extent, in, which, geography, as, an, academic, study, is, implicated, in, colonialism, is, contentious, geographical, tools, such, as, cartography, shipbuilding, navigation, mining, and, agricultural, productivity, were, instrumental, in, european, colonial, expansion, colonisers, awareness, of, the, earth, s, surface, and, abundance, of, practical, skills, provided, colonisers, with, a, knowledge, that, in, turn, created, power, anne, godlewska, and, neil, smith, argue, that, empire, was, quintessentially, a, geographical, project, historical, geographical, theories, such, as, environmental, determinism, legitimised, colonialism, by, positing, the, view, that, some, parts, of, the, world, were, underdeveloped, which, created, notions, of, skewed, evolution, geographers, such, as, ellen, churchill, semple, and, ellsworth, huntington, put, forward, the, notion, that, northern, climates, bred, vigour, and, intelligence, as, opposed, to, those, indigenous, to, tropical, climates, see, the, tropics, viz, a, viz, a, combination, of, environmental, determinism, and, social, darwinism, in, their, approach, political, geographers, also, maintain, that, colonial, behaviour, was, reinforced, by, the, physical, mapping, of, the, world, therefore, creating, a, visual, separation, between, them, and, us, geographers, are, primarily, focused, on, the, spaces, of, colonialism, and, imperialism, more, specifically, the, material, and, symbolic, appropriation, of, space, enabling, colonialism, 5, maps, played, an, extensive, role, in, colonialism, as, bassett, would, put, it, by, providing, geographical, information, in, a, convenient, and, standardised, format, cartographers, helped, open, west, africa, to, european, conquest, commerce, and, colonisation, because, the, relationship, between, colonialism, and, geography, was, not, scientifically, objective, cartography, was, often, manipulated, during, the, colonial, era, social, norms, and, values, had, an, effect, on, the, constructing, of, maps, during, colonialism, map, makers, used, rhetoric, in, their, formation, of, boundaries, and, in, their, art, the, rhetoric, favoured, the, view, of, the, conquering, europeans, this, is, evident, in, the, fact, that, any, map, created, by, a, non, european, was, instantly, regarded, as, inaccurate, furthermore, european, cartographers, were, required, to, follow, a, set, of, rules, which, led, to, ethnocentrism, portraying, one, s, own, ethnicity, in, the, centre, of, the, map, as, j, b, harley, put, it, the, steps, in, making, a, map, selection, omission, simplification, classification, the, creation, of, hierarchies, and, symbolisation, are, all, inherently, rhetorical, a, common, practice, by, the, european, cartographers, of, the, time, was, to, map, unexplored, areas, as, blank, spaces, this, influenced, the, colonial, powers, as, it, sparked, competition, amongst, them, to, explore, and, colonise, these, regions, imperialists, aggressively, and, passionately, looked, forward, to, filling, these, spaces, for, the, glory, of, their, respective, countries, the, dictionary, of, human, geography, notes, that, cartography, was, used, to, empty, undiscovered, lands, of, their, indigenous, meaning, and, bring, them, into, spatial, existence, via, the, imposition, of, western, place, names, and, borders, priming, virgin, putatively, empty, land, wilderness, for, colonisation, thus, sexualising, colonial, landscapes, as, domains, of, male, penetration, reconfiguring, alien, space, as, absolute, quantifiable, and, separable, as, property, david, livingstone, stresses, that, geography, has, meant, different, things, at, different, times, and, in, different, places, and, that, we, should, keep, an, open, mind, in, regards, to, the, relationship, between, geography, and, colonialism, instead, of, identifying, boundaries, geography, as, a, discipline, was, not, and, is, not, an, objective, science, painter, and, jeffrey, argue, rather, it, is, based, on, assumptions, about, the, physical, world, comparison, of, exogeographical, representations, of, ostensibly, tropical, environments, in, science, fiction, art, support, this, conjecture, finding, the, notion, of, the, tropics, to, be, an, artificial, collection, of, ideas, and, beliefs, that, are, independent, of, geography, with, contemporary, advances, in, deep, sea, and, outer, space, technologies, colonization, of, the, seabed, and, the, moon, have, become, an, object, of, non, terrestrial, colonialism, the, term, imperialism, is, often, conflated, with, colonialism, however, many, scholars, have, argued, that, each, has, its, own, distinct, definition, imperialism, and, colonialism, have, been, used, in, order, to, describe, one, s, influence, upon, a, person, or, group, of, people, robert, young, writes, that, imperialism, operates, from, the, centre, as, a, state, policy, and, is, developed, for, ideological, as, well, as, financial, reasons, while, colonialism, is, simply, the, development, for, settlement, or, commercial, intentions, however, colonialism, still, includes, invasion, colonialism, in, modern, usage, also, tends, to, imply, a, degree, of, geographic, separation, between, the, colony, and, the, imperial, power, particularly, edward, said, distinguishes, between, imperialism, and, colonialism, by, stating, imperialism, involved, the, practice, the, theory, and, the, attitudes, of, a, dominating, metropolitan, center, ruling, a, distant, territory, while, colonialism, refers, to, the, implanting, of, settlements, on, a, distant, territory, contiguous, land, empires, such, as, the, russian, chinese, or, ottoman, have, traditionally, been, excluded, from, discussions, of, colonialism, though, this, is, beginning, to, change, since, it, is, accepted, that, they, also, sent, populations, into, the, territories, they, ruled, 116, imperialism, and, colonialism, both, dictate, the, political, and, economic, advantage, over, a, land, and, the, indigenous, populations, they, control, yet, scholars, sometimes, find, it, difficult, to, illustrate, the, difference, between, the, two, 107, although, imperialism, and, colonialism, focus, on, the, suppression, of, another, if, colonialism, refers, to, the, process, of, a, country, taking, physical, control, of, another, imperialism, refers, to, the, political, and, monetary, dominance, either, formally, or, informally, colonialism, is, seen, to, be, the, architect, deciding, how, to, start, dominating, areas, and, then, imperialism, can, be, seen, as, creating, the, idea, behind, conquest, cooperating, with, colonialism, colonialism, is, when, the, imperial, nation, begins, a, conquest, over, an, area, and, then, eventually, is, able, to, rule, over, the, areas, the, previous, nation, had, controlled, colonialism, s, core, meaning, is, the, exploitation, of, the, valuable, assets, and, supplies, of, the, nation, that, was, conquered, and, the, conquering, nation, then, gaining, the, benefits, from, the, spoils, of, the, war, 170, 75, the, meaning, of, imperialism, is, to, create, an, empire, by, conquering, the, other, state, s, lands, and, therefore, increasing, its, own, dominance, colonialism, is, the, builder, and, preserver, of, the, colonial, possessions, in, an, area, by, a, population, coming, from, a, foreign, region, 173, 76, colonialism, can, completely, change, the, existing, social, structure, physical, structure, and, economics, of, an, area, it, is, not, unusual, that, the, characteristics, of, the, conquering, peoples, are, inherited, by, the, conquered, indigenous, populations, 41, few, colonies, remain, remote, from, their, mother, country, thus, most, will, eventually, establish, a, separate, nationality, or, remain, under, complete, control, of, their, mother, colony, marxism, views, colonialism, as, a, form, of, capitalism, enforcing, exploitation, and, social, change, marx, thought, that, working, within, the, global, capitalist, system, colonialism, is, closely, associated, with, uneven, development, it, is, an, instrument, of, wholesale, destruction, dependency, and, systematic, exploitation, producing, distorted, economies, socio, psychological, disorientation, massive, poverty, and, neocolonial, dependency, colonies, are, constructed, into, modes, of, production, the, search, for, raw, materials, and, the, current, search, for, new, investment, opportunities, is, a, result, of, inter, capitalist, rivalry, for, capital, accumulation, lenin, regarded, colonialism, as, the, root, cause, of, imperialism, as, imperialism, was, distinguished, by, monopoly, capitalism, via, colonialism, and, as, lyal, s, sunga, explains, vladimir, lenin, advocated, forcefully, the, principle, of, self, determination, of, peoples, in, his, theses, on, the, socialist, revolution, and, the, right, of, nations, to, self, determination, as, an, integral, plank, in, the, programme, of, socialist, internationalism, and, he, quotes, lenin, who, contended, that, the, right, of, nations, to, self, determination, implies, exclusively, the, right, to, independence, in, the, political, sense, the, right, to, free, political, separation, from, the, oppressor, nation, specifically, this, demand, for, political, democracy, implies, complete, freedom, to, agitate, for, secession, and, for, a, referendum, on, secession, by, the, seceding, nation, non, russian, marxists, within, the, rsfsr, and, later, the, ussr, like, sultan, galiev, and, vasyl, shakhrai, meanwhile, between, 1918, and, 1923, and, then, after, 1929, considered, the, soviet, regime, a, renewed, version, of, russian, imperialism, and, colonialism, in, his, critique, of, colonialism, in, africa, the, guyanese, historian, and, political, activist, walter, rodney, states, the, decisiveness, of, the, short, period, of, colonialism, and, its, negative, consequences, for, africa, spring, mainly, from, the, fact, that, africa, lost, power, power, is, the, ultimate, determinant, in, human, society, being, basic, to, the, relations, within, any, group, and, between, groups, it, implies, the, ability, to, defend, one, s, interests, and, if, necessary, to, impose, one, s, will, by, any, means, available, when, one, society, finds, itself, forced, to, relinquish, power, entirely, to, another, society, that, in, itself, is, a, form, of, underdevelopment, during, the, centuries, of, pre, colonial, trade, some, control, over, social, political, and, economic, life, was, retained, in, africa, in, spite, of, the, disadvantageous, commerce, with, europeans, that, little, control, over, internal, matters, disappeared, under, colonialism, colonialism, went, much, further, than, trade, it, meant, a, tendency, towards, direct, appropriation, by, europeans, of, the, social, institutions, within, africa, africans, ceased, to, set, indigenous, cultural, goals, and, standards, and, lost, full, command, of, training, young, members, of, the, society, those, were, undoubtedly, major, steps, backwards, colonialism, was, not, merely, a, system, of, exploitation, but, one, whose, essential, purpose, was, to, repatriate, the, profits, to, the, so, called, mother, country, from, an, african, view, point, that, amounted, to, consistent, expatriation, of, surplus, produced, by, african, labour, out, of, african, resources, it, meant, the, development, of, europe, as, part, of, the, same, dialectical, process, in, which, africa, was, underdeveloped, colonial, africa, fell, within, that, part, of, the, international, capitalist, economy, from, which, surplus, was, drawn, to, feed, the, metropolitan, sector, as, seen, earlier, exploitation, of, land, and, labour, is, essential, for, human, social, advance, but, only, on, the, assumption, that, the, product, is, made, available, within, the, area, where, the, exploitation, takes, place, according, to, lenin, the, new, imperialism, emphasised, the, transition, of, capitalism, from, free, trade, to, a, stage, of, monopoly, capitalism, to, finance, capital, he, states, it, is, connected, with, the, intensification, of, the, struggle, for, the, partition, of, the, world, as, free, trade, thrives, on, exports, of, commodities, monopoly, capitalism, thrived, on, the, export, of, capital, amassed, by, profits, from, banks, and, industry, this, to, lenin, was, the, highest, stage, of, capitalism, he, goes, on, to, state, that, this, form, of, capitalism, was, doomed, for, war, between, the, capitalists, and, the, exploited, nations, with, the, former, inevitably, losing, war, is, stated, to, be, the, consequence, of, imperialism, as, a, continuation, of, this, thought, g, n, uzoigwe, states, but, it, is, now, clear, from, more, serious, investigations, of, african, history, in, this, period, that, imperialism, was, essentially, economic, in, its, fundamental, impulses, classical, liberals, were, generally, in, abstract, opposition, to, colonialism, and, imperialism, including, adam, smith, fr, d, ric, bastiat, richard, cobden, john, bright, henry, richard, herbert, spencer, h, r, fox, bourne, edward, morel, josephine, butler, w, j, fox, and, william, ewart, gladstone, their, philosophies, found, the, colonial, enterprise, particularly, mercantilism, in, opposition, to, the, principles, of, free, trade, and, liberal, policies, adam, smith, wrote, in, the, wealth, of, nations, that, britain, should, grant, independence, to, all, of, its, colonies, and, also, argued, that, it, would, be, economically, beneficial, for, british, people, in, the, average, although, the, merchants, having, mercantilist, privileges, would, lose, out, during, the, colonial, era, the, global, process, of, colonisation, served, to, spread, and, synthesize, the, social, and, political, belief, systems, of, the, mother, countries, which, often, included, a, belief, in, a, certain, natural, racial, superiority, of, the, race, of, the, mother, country, colonialism, also, acted, to, reinforce, these, same, racial, belief, systems, within, the, mother, countries, themselves, usually, also, included, within, the, colonial, belief, systems, was, a, certain, belief, in, the, inherent, superiority, of, male, over, female, this, particular, belief, was, often, pre, existing, amongst, the, pre, colonial, societies, prior, to, their, colonisation, popular, political, practices, of, the, time, reinforced, colonial, rule, by, legitimising, european, and, or, japanese, male, authority, and, also, legitimising, female, and, non, mother, country, race, inferiority, through, studies, of, craniology, comparative, anatomy, and, phrenology, biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and, ethnologists, of, the, 19th, century, were, focused, on, the, study, of, colonised, indigenous, women, as, in, the, case, of, georges, cuvier, s, study, of, sarah, baartman, such, cases, embraced, a, natural, superiority, and, inferiority, relationship, between, the, races, based, on, the, observations, of, naturalists, from, the, mother, countries, european, studies, along, these, lines, gave, rise, to, the, perception, that, african, women, s, anatomy, and, especially, genitalia, resembled, those, of, mandrills, baboons, and, monkeys, thus, differentiating, colonised, africans, from, what, were, viewed, as, the, features, of, the, evolutionarily, superior, and, thus, rightfully, authoritarian, european, woman, in, addition, to, what, would, now, be, viewed, as, pseudo, scientific, studies, of, race, which, tended, to, reinforce, a, belief, in, an, inherent, mother, country, racial, superiority, a, new, supposedly, science, based, ideology, concerning, gender, roles, also, then, emerged, as, an, adjunct, to, the, general, body, of, beliefs, of, inherent, superiority, of, the, colonial, era, female, inferiority, across, all, cultures, was, emerging, as, an, idea, supposedly, supported, by, craniology, that,
