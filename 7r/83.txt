in, finance, a, derivative, is, a, contract, that, derives, its, value, from, the, performance, of, an, underlying, entity, this, underlying, entity, can, be, an, asset, index, or, interest, rate, and, is, often, simply, called, the, underlying, derivatives, can, be, used, for, a, number, of, purposes, including, insuring, against, price, movements, hedging, increasing, exposure, to, price, movements, for, speculation, or, getting, access, to, otherwise, hard, to, trade, assets, or, markets, some, of, the, more, common, derivatives, include, forwards, futures, options, swaps, and, variations, of, these, such, as, synthetic, collateralized, debt, obligations, and, credit, default, swaps, most, derivatives, are, traded, over, the, counter, off, exchange, or, on, an, exchange, such, as, the, chicago, mercantile, exchange, while, most, insurance, contracts, have, developed, into, a, separate, industry, in, the, united, states, after, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crisis, there, has, been, increased, pressure, to, move, derivatives, to, trade, on, exchanges, derivatives, are, one, of, the, three, main, categories, of, financial, instruments, the, other, two, being, equity, i, e, stocks, or, shares, and, debt, i, e, bonds, and, mortgages, the, oldest, example, of, a, derivative, in, history, attested, to, by, aristotle, is, thought, to, be, a, contract, transaction, of, olives, entered, into, by, ancient, greek, philosopher, thales, who, made, a, profit, in, the, exchange, however, aristotle, did, not, define, this, arrangement, as, a, derivative, but, as, a, monopoly, aristotle, s, politics, book, i, chapter, xi, bucket, shops, outlawed, in, 1936, in, the, us, are, a, more, recent, historical, example, derivatives, are, contracts, between, two, parties, that, specify, conditions, especially, the, dates, resulting, values, and, definitions, of, the, underlying, variables, the, parties, contractual, obligations, and, the, notional, amount, under, which, payments, are, to, be, made, between, the, parties, the, assets, include, commodities, stocks, bonds, interest, rates, and, currencies, but, they, can, also, be, other, derivatives, which, adds, another, layer, of, complexity, to, proper, valuation, the, components, of, a, firm, s, capital, structure, e, g, bonds, and, stock, can, also, be, considered, derivatives, more, precisely, options, with, the, underlying, being, the, firm, s, assets, but, this, is, unusual, outside, of, technical, contexts, from, the, economic, point, of, view, financial, derivatives, are, cash, flows, that, are, conditioned, stochastically, and, discounted, to, present, value, the, market, risk, inherent, in, the, underlying, asset, is, attached, to, the, financial, derivative, through, contractual, agreements, and, hence, can, be, traded, separately, the, underlying, asset, does, not, have, to, be, acquired, derivatives, therefore, allow, the, breakup, of, ownership, and, participation, in, the, market, value, of, an, asset, this, also, provides, a, considerable, amount, of, freedom, regarding, the, contract, design, that, contractual, freedom, allows, derivative, designers, to, modify, the, participation, in, the, performance, of, the, underlying, asset, almost, arbitrarily, thus, the, participation, in, the, market, value, of, the, underlying, can, be, effectively, weaker, stronger, leverage, effect, or, implemented, as, inverse, hence, specifically, the, market, price, risk, of, the, underlying, asset, can, be, controlled, in, almost, every, situation, there, are, two, groups, of, derivative, contracts, the, privately, traded, over, the, counter, otc, derivatives, such, as, swaps, that, do, not, go, through, an, exchange, or, other, intermediary, and, exchange, traded, derivatives, etd, that, are, traded, through, specialized, derivatives, exchanges, or, other, exchanges, derivatives, are, more, common, in, the, modern, era, but, their, origins, trace, back, several, centuries, one, of, the, oldest, derivatives, is, rice, futures, which, have, been, traded, on, the, dojima, rice, exchange, since, the, eighteenth, century, derivatives, are, broadly, categorized, by, the, relationship, between, the, underlying, asset, and, the, derivative, such, as, forward, option, swap, the, type, of, underlying, asset, such, as, equity, derivatives, foreign, exchange, derivatives, interest, rate, derivatives, commodity, derivatives, or, credit, derivatives, the, market, in, which, they, trade, such, as, exchange, traded, or, over, the, counter, and, their, pay, off, profile, derivatives, may, broadly, be, categorized, as, lock, or, option, products, lock, products, such, as, swaps, futures, or, forwards, obligate, the, contractual, parties, to, the, terms, over, the, life, of, the, contract, option, products, such, as, interest, rate, swaps, provide, the, buyer, the, right, but, not, the, obligation, to, enter, the, contract, under, the, terms, specified, derivatives, can, be, used, either, for, risk, management, i, e, to, hedge, by, providing, offsetting, compensation, in, case, of, an, undesired, event, a, kind, of, insurance, or, for, speculation, i, e, making, a, financial, bet, this, distinction, is, important, because, the, former, is, a, prudent, aspect, of, operations, and, financial, management, for, many, firms, across, many, industries, the, latter, offers, managers, and, investors, a, risky, opportunity, to, increase, profit, which, may, not, be, properly, disclosed, to, stakeholders, along, with, many, other, financial, products, and, services, derivatives, reform, is, an, element, of, the, dodd, frank, wall, street, reform, and, consumer, protection, act, of, 2010, the, act, delegated, many, rule, making, details, of, regulatory, oversight, to, the, commodity, futures, trading, commission, cftc, and, those, details, are, not, finalized, nor, fully, implemented, as, of, late, 2012, to, give, an, idea, of, the, size, of, the, derivative, market, the, economist, has, reported, that, as, of, june, 2011, the, over, the, counter, otc, derivatives, market, amounted, to, approximately, 700, trillion, and, the, size, of, the, market, traded, on, exchanges, totaled, an, additional, 83, trillion, for, the, fourth, quarter, 2017, the, european, securities, market, authority, estimated, the, size, of, european, derivatives, market, at, a, size, of, 660, trillion, with, 74, million, outstanding, contracts, however, these, are, notional, values, and, some, economists, say, that, these, aggregated, values, greatly, exaggerate, the, market, value, and, the, true, credit, risk, faced, by, the, parties, involved, for, example, in, 2010, while, the, aggregate, of, otc, derivatives, exceeded, 600, trillion, the, value, of, the, market, was, estimated, to, be, much, lower, at, 21, trillion, the, credit, risk, equivalent, of, the, derivative, contracts, was, estimated, at, 3, 3, trillion, still, even, these, scaled, down, figures, represent, huge, amounts, of, money, for, perspective, the, budget, for, total, expenditure, of, the, united, states, government, during, 2012, was, 3, 5, trillion, and, the, total, current, value, of, the, u, s, stock, market, is, an, estimated, 23, trillion, meanwhile, the, global, annual, gross, domestic, product, is, about, 65, trillion, at, least, for, one, type, of, derivative, credit, default, swaps, cds, for, which, the, inherent, risk, is, considered, high, the, higher, nominal, value, remains, relevant, it, was, this, type, of, derivative, that, investment, magnate, warren, buffett, referred, to, in, his, famous, 2002, speech, in, which, he, warned, against, financial, weapons, of, mass, destruction, cds, notional, value, in, early, 2012, amounted, to, 25, 5, trillion, down, from, 55, trillion, in, 2008, derivatives, are, used, for, the, following, lock, products, are, theoretically, valued, at, zero, at, the, time, of, execution, and, thus, do, not, typically, require, an, up, front, exchange, between, the, parties, based, upon, movements, in, the, underlying, asset, over, time, however, the, value, of, the, contract, will, fluctuate, and, the, derivative, may, be, either, an, asset, i, e, in, the, money, or, a, liability, i, e, out, of, the, money, at, different, points, throughout, its, life, importantly, either, party, is, therefore, exposed, to, the, credit, quality, of, its, counterparty, and, is, interested, in, protecting, itself, in, an, event, of, default, option, products, have, immediate, value, at, the, outset, because, they, provide, specified, protection, intrinsic, value, over, a, given, time, period, time, value, one, common, form, of, option, product, familiar, to, many, consumers, is, insurance, for, homes, and, automobiles, the, insured, would, pay, more, for, a, policy, with, greater, liability, protections, intrinsic, value, and, one, that, extends, for, a, year, rather, than, six, months, time, value, because, of, the, immediate, option, value, the, option, purchaser, typically, pays, an, up, front, premium, just, like, for, lock, products, movements, in, the, underlying, asset, will, cause, the, option, s, intrinsic, value, to, change, over, time, while, its, time, value, deteriorates, steadily, until, the, contract, expires, an, important, difference, between, a, lock, product, is, that, after, the, initial, exchange, the, option, purchaser, has, no, further, liability, to, its, counterparty, upon, maturity, the, purchaser, will, execute, the, option, if, it, has, positive, value, i, e, if, it, is, in, the, money, or, expire, at, no, cost, other, than, to, the, initial, premium, i, e, if, the, option, is, out, of, the, money, derivatives, allow, risk, related, to, the, price, of, the, underlying, asset, to, be, transferred, from, one, party, to, another, for, example, a, wheat, farmer, and, a, miller, could, sign, a, futures, contract, to, exchange, a, specified, amount, of, cash, for, a, specified, amount, of, wheat, in, the, future, both, parties, have, reduced, a, future, risk, for, the, wheat, farmer, the, uncertainty, of, the, price, and, for, the, miller, the, availability, of, wheat, however, there, is, still, the, risk, that, no, wheat, will, be, available, because, of, events, unspecified, by, the, contract, such, as, the, weather, or, that, one, party, will, renege, on, the, contract, although, a, third, party, called, a, clearing, house, insures, a, futures, contract, not, all, derivatives, are, insured, against, counter, party, risk, from, another, perspective, the, farmer, and, the, miller, both, reduce, a, risk, and, acquire, a, risk, when, they, sign, the, futures, contract, the, farmer, reduces, the, risk, that, the, price, of, wheat, will, fall, below, the, price, specified, in, the, contract, and, acquires, the, risk, that, the, price, of, wheat, will, rise, above, the, price, specified, in, the, contract, thereby, losing, additional, income, that, he, could, have, earned, the, miller, on, the, other, hand, acquires, the, risk, that, the, price, of, wheat, will, fall, below, the, price, specified, in, the, contract, thereby, paying, more, in, the, future, than, he, otherwise, would, have, and, reduces, the, risk, that, the, price, of, wheat, will, rise, above, the, price, specified, in, the, contract, in, this, sense, one, party, is, the, insurer, risk, taker, for, one, type, of, risk, and, the, counter, party, is, the, insurer, risk, taker, for, another, type, of, risk, hedging, also, occurs, when, an, individual, or, institution, buys, an, asset, such, as, a, commodity, a, bond, that, has, coupon, payments, a, stock, that, pays, dividends, and, so, on, and, sells, it, using, a, futures, contract, the, individual, or, institution, has, access, to, the, asset, for, a, specified, amount, of, time, and, can, then, sell, it, in, the, future, at, a, specified, price, according, to, the, futures, contract, of, course, this, allows, the, individual, or, institution, the, benefit, of, holding, the, asset, while, reducing, the, risk, that, the, future, selling, price, will, deviate, unexpectedly, from, the, market, s, current, assessment, of, the, future, value, of, the, asset, derivatives, trading, of, this, kind, may, serve, the, financial, interests, of, certain, particular, businesses, for, example, a, corporation, borrows, a, large, sum, of, money, at, a, specific, interest, rate, the, interest, rate, on, the, loan, reprices, every, six, months, the, corporation, is, concerned, that, the, rate, of, interest, may, be, much, higher, in, six, months, the, corporation, could, buy, a, forward, rate, agreement, fra, which, is, a, contract, to, pay, a, fixed, rate, of, interest, six, months, after, purchases, on, a, notional, amount, of, money, if, the, interest, rate, after, six, months, is, above, the, contract, rate, the, seller, will, pay, the, difference, to, the, corporation, or, fra, buyer, if, the, rate, is, lower, the, corporation, will, pay, the, difference, to, the, seller, the, purchase, of, the, fra, serves, to, reduce, the, uncertainty, concerning, the, rate, increase, and, stabilize, earnings, derivatives, can, be, used, to, acquire, risk, rather, than, to, hedge, against, risk, thus, some, individuals, and, institutions, will, enter, into, a, derivative, contract, to, speculate, on, the, value, of, the, underlying, asset, speculators, look, to, buy, an, asset, in, the, future, at, a, low, price, according, to, a, derivative, contract, when, the, future, market, price, is, high, or, to, sell, an, asset, in, the, future, at, a, high, price, according, to, a, derivative, contract, when, the, future, market, price, is, less, speculative, trading, in, derivatives, gained, a, great, deal, of, notoriety, in, 1995, when, nick, leeson, a, trader, at, barings, bank, made, poor, and, unauthorized, investments, in, futures, contracts, through, a, combination, of, poor, judgment, lack, of, oversight, by, the, bank, s, management, and, regulators, and, unfortunate, events, like, the, kobe, earthquake, leeson, incurred, a, 1, 3, billion, loss, that, bankrupted, the, centuries, old, institution, individuals, and, institutions, may, also, look, for, arbitrage, opportunities, as, when, the, current, buying, price, of, an, asset, falls, below, the, price, specified, in, a, futures, contract, to, sell, the, asset, the, true, proportion, of, derivatives, contracts, used, for, hedging, purposes, is, unknown, but, it, appears, to, be, relatively, small, also, derivatives, contracts, account, for, only, 3, 6, of, the, median, firms, total, currency, and, interest, rate, exposure, nonetheless, we, know, that, many, firms, derivatives, activities, have, at, least, some, speculative, component, for, a, variety, of, reasons, in, broad, terms, there, are, two, groups, of, derivative, contracts, which, are, distinguished, by, the, way, they, are, traded, in, the, market, over, the, counter, otc, derivatives, are, contracts, that, are, traded, and, privately, negotiated, directly, between, two, parties, without, going, through, an, exchange, or, other, intermediary, products, such, as, swaps, forward, rate, agreements, exotic, options, and, other, exotic, derivatives, are, almost, always, traded, in, this, way, the, otc, derivative, market, is, the, largest, market, for, derivatives, and, is, largely, unregulated, with, respect, to, disclosure, of, information, between, the, parties, since, the, otc, market, is, made, up, of, banks, and, other, highly, sophisticated, parties, such, as, hedge, funds, reporting, of, otc, amounts, is, difficult, because, trades, can, occur, in, private, without, activity, being, visible, on, any, exchanges, according, to, the, bank, for, international, settlements, who, first, surveyed, otc, derivatives, in, 1995, reported, that, the, gross, market, value, which, represent, the, cost, of, replacing, all, open, contracts, at, the, prevailing, market, prices, increased, by, 74, since, 2004, to, 11, trillion, at, the, end, of, june, 2007, bis, 2007, 24, positions, in, the, otc, derivatives, market, increased, to, 516, trillion, at, the, end, of, june, 2007, 135, higher, than, the, level, recorded, in, 2004, the, total, outstanding, notional, amount, is, us, 708, trillion, as, of, june, 2011, of, this, total, notional, amount, 67, are, interest, rate, contracts, 8, are, credit, default, swaps, cds, 9, are, foreign, exchange, contracts, 2, are, commodity, contracts, 1, are, equity, contracts, and, 12, are, other, because, otc, derivatives, are, not, traded, on, an, exchange, there, is, no, central, counter, party, therefore, they, are, subject, to, counterparty, risk, like, an, ordinary, contract, since, each, counter, party, relies, on, the, other, to, perform, exchange, traded, derivatives, etd, are, those, derivatives, instruments, that, are, traded, via, specialized, derivatives, exchanges, or, other, exchanges, a, derivatives, exchange, is, a, market, where, individuals, trade, standardized, contracts, that, have, been, defined, by, the, exchange, a, derivatives, exchange, acts, as, an, intermediary, to, all, related, transactions, and, takes, initial, margin, from, both, sides, of, the, trade, to, act, as, a, guarantee, the, world, s, largest, derivatives, exchanges, by, number, of, transactions, are, the, korea, exchange, which, lists, kospi, index, futures, options, eurex, which, lists, a, wide, range, of, european, products, such, as, interest, rate, index, products, and, cme, group, made, up, of, the, 2007, merger, of, the, chicago, mercantile, exchange, and, the, chicago, board, of, trade, and, the, 2008, acquisition, of, the, new, york, mercantile, exchange, according, to, bis, the, combined, turnover, in, the, world, s, derivatives, exchanges, totaled, us, 344, trillion, during, q4, 2005, by, december, 2007, the, bank, for, international, settlements, reported, that, derivatives, traded, on, exchanges, surged, 27, to, a, record, 681, trillion, inverse, exchange, traded, funds, ietfs, and, leveraged, exchange, traded, funds, letfs, are, two, special, types, of, exchange, traded, funds, etfs, that, are, available, to, common, traders, and, investors, on, major, exchanges, like, the, nyse, and, nasdaq, to, maintain, these, products, net, asset, value, these, funds, administrators, must, employ, more, sophisticated, financial, engineering, methods, than, what, s, usually, required, for, maintenance, of, traditional, etfs, these, instruments, must, also, be, regularly, rebalanced, and, re, indexed, each, day, some, of, the, common, variants, of, derivative, contracts, are, as, follows, some, common, examples, of, these, derivatives, are, the, following, a, collateralized, debt, obligation, cdo, is, a, type, of, structured, asset, backed, security, abs, an, asset, backed, security, is, used, as, an, umbrella, term, for, a, type, of, security, backed, by, a, pool, of, assets, including, collateralized, debt, obligations, and, mortgage, backed, securities, mbs, example, the, capital, market, in, which, asset, backed, securities, are, issued, and, traded, is, composed, of, three, main, categories, abs, mbs, and, cdos, and, sometimes, for, a, particular, type, of, that, security, one, backed, by, consumer, loans, example, as, a, rule, of, thumb, securitization, issues, backed, by, mortgages, are, called, mbs, and, securitization, issues, backed, by, debt, obligations, are, called, cdo, securitization, issues, backed, by, consumer, backed, products, car, loans, consumer, loans, and, credit, cards, among, others, are, called, abs, originally, developed, for, the, corporate, debt, markets, over, time, cdos, evolved, to, encompass, the, mortgage, and, mortgage, backed, security, mbs, markets, like, other, private, label, securities, backed, by, assets, a, cdo, can, be, thought, of, as, a, promise, to, pay, investors, in, a, prescribed, sequence, based, on, the, cash, flow, the, cdo, collects, from, the, pool, of, bonds, or, other, assets, it, owns, the, cdo, is, sliced, into, tranches, which, catch, the, cash, flow, of, interest, and, principal, payments, in, sequence, based, on, seniority, if, some, loans, default, and, the, cash, collected, by, the, cdo, is, insufficient, to, pay, all, of, its, investors, those, in, the, lowest, most, junior, tranches, suffer, losses, first, the, last, to, lose, payment, from, default, are, the, safest, most, senior, tranches, consequently, coupon, payments, and, interest, rates, vary, by, tranche, with, the, safest, most, senior, tranches, paying, the, lowest, and, the, lowest, tranches, paying, the, highest, rates, to, compensate, for, higher, default, risk, as, an, example, a, cdo, might, issue, the, following, tranches, in, order, of, safeness, senior, aaa, sometimes, known, as, super, senior, junior, aaa, aa, a, bbb, residual, separate, special, purpose, entities, rather, than, the, parent, investment, bank, issue, the, cdos, and, pay, interest, to, investors, as, cdos, developed, some, sponsors, repackaged, tranches, into, yet, another, iteration, called, cdo, squared, or, the, cdos, of, cdos, in, the, early, 2000s, cdos, were, generally, diversified, but, by, 2006, 2007, when, the, cdo, market, grew, to, hundreds, of, billions, of, dollars, this, changed, cdo, collateral, became, dominated, not, by, loans, but, by, lower, level, bbb, or, a, tranches, recycled, from, other, asset, backed, securities, whose, assets, were, usually, non, prime, mortgages, these, cdos, have, been, called, the, engine, that, powered, the, mortgage, supply, chain, for, nonprime, mortgages, and, are, credited, with, giving, lenders, greater, incentive, to, make, non, prime, loans, leading, up, to, the, 2007, 9, subprime, mortgage, crisis, a, credit, default, swap, cds, is, a, financial, swap, agreement, that, the, seller, of, the, cds, will, compensate, the, buyer, the, creditor, of, the, reference, loan, in, the, event, of, a, loan, default, by, the, debtor, or, other, credit, event, the, buyer, of, the, cds, makes, a, series, of, payments, the, cds, fee, or, spread, to, the, seller, and, in, exchange, receives, a, payoff, if, the, loan, defaults, it, was, invented, by, blythe, masters, from, jp, morgan, in, 1994, in, the, event, of, default, the, buyer, of, the, cds, receives, compensation, usually, the, face, value, of, the, loan, and, the, seller, of, the, cds, takes, possession, of, the, defaulted, loan, however, anyone, with, sufficient, collateral, to, trade, with, a, bank, or, hedge, fund, can, purchase, a, cds, even, buyers, who, do, not, hold, the, loan, instrument, and, who, have, no, direct, insurable, interest, in, the, loan, these, are, called, naked, cdss, if, there, are, more, cds, contracts, outstanding, than, bonds, in, existence, a, protocol, exists, to, hold, a, credit, event, auction, the, payment, received, is, usually, substantially, less, than, the, face, value, of, the, loan, credit, default, swaps, have, existed, since, the, early, 1990s, and, increased, in, use, after, 2003, by, the, end, of, 2007, the, outstanding, cds, amount, was, 62, 2, trillion, falling, to, 26, 3, trillion, by, mid, year, 2010, but, reportedly, 25, 5, trillion, in, early, 2012, cdss, are, not, traded, on, an, exchange, and, there, is, no, required, reporting, of, transactions, to, a, government, agency, during, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crisis, the, lack, of, transparency, in, this, large, market, became, a, concern, to, regulators, as, it, could, pose, a, systemic, risk, in, march, 2010, the, trade, information, warehouse, announced, it, would, give, regulators, greater, access, to, its, credit, default, swaps, database, cds, data, can, be, used, by, financial, professionals, regulators, and, the, media, to, monitor, how, the, market, views, credit, risk, of, any, entity, on, which, a, cds, is, available, which, can, be, compared, to, that, provided, by, credit, rating, agencies, u, s, courts, may, soon, be, following, suit, most, cdss, are, documented, using, standard, forms, drafted, by, the, international, swaps, and, derivatives, association, isda, although, there, are, many, variants, in, addition, to, the, basic, single, name, swaps, there, are, basket, default, swaps, bdss, index, cdss, funded, cdss, also, called, credit, linked, notes, as, well, as, loan, only, credit, default, swaps, lcds, in, addition, to, corporations, and, governments, the, reference, entity, can, include, a, special, purpose, vehicle, issuing, asset, backed, securities, some, claim, that, derivatives, such, as, cds, are, potentially, dangerous, in, that, they, combine, priority, in, bankruptcy, with, a, lack, of, transparency, a, cds, can, be, unsecured, without, collateral, and, be, at, higher, risk, for, a, default, in, finance, a, forward, contract, or, simply, a, forward, is, a, non, standardized, contract, between, two, parties, to, buy, or, to, sell, an, asset, at, a, specified, future, time, at, an, amount, agreed, upon, today, making, it, a, type, of, derivative, instrument, this, is, in, contrast, to, a, spot, contract, which, is, an, agreement, to, buy, or, sell, an, asset, on, its, spot, date, which, may, vary, depending, on, the, instrument, for, example, most, of, the, fx, contracts, have, spot, date, two, business, days, from, today, the, party, agreeing, to, buy, the, underlying, asset, in, the, future, assumes, a, long, position, and, the, party, agreeing, to, sell, the, asset, in, the, future, assumes, a, short, position, the, price, agreed, upon, is, called, the, delivery, price, which, is, equal, to, the, forward, price, at, the, time, the, contract, is, entered, into, the, price, of, the, underlying, instrument, in, whatever, form, is, paid, before, control, of, the, instrument, changes, this, is, one, of, the, many, forms, of, buy, sell, orders, where, the, time, and, date, of, trade, is, not, the, same, as, the, value, date, where, the, securities, themselves, are, exchanged, the, forward, price, of, such, a, contract, is, commonly, contrasted, with, the, spot, price, which, is, the, price, at, which, the, asset, changes, hands, on, the, spot, date, the, difference, between, the, spot, and, the, forward, price, is, the, forward, premium, or, forward, discount, generally, considered, in, the, form, of, a, profit, or, loss, by, the, purchasing, party, forwards, like, other, derivative, securities, can, be, used, to, hedge, risk, typically, currency, or, exchange, rate, risk, as, a, means, of, speculation, or, to, allow, a, party, to, take, advantage, of, a, quality, of, the, underlying, instrument, which, is, time, sensitive, a, closely, related, contract, is, a, futures, contract, they, differ, in, certain, respects, forward, contracts, are, very, similar, to, futures, contracts, except, they, are, not, exchange, traded, or, defined, on, standardized, assets, forwards, also, typically, have, no, interim, partial, settlements, or, true, ups, in, margin, requirements, like, futures, such, that, the, parties, do, not, exchange, additional, property, securing, the, party, at, gain, and, the, entire, unrealized, gain, or, loss, builds, up, while, the, contract, is, open, however, being, traded, over, the, counter, otc, forward, contracts, specification, can, be, customized, and, may, include, mark, to, market, and, daily, margin, calls, hence, a, forward, contract, arrangement, might, call, for, the, loss, party, to, pledge, collateral, or, additional, collateral, to, better, secure, the, party, at, gain, in, other, words, the, terms, of, the, forward, contract, will, determine, the, collateral, calls, based, upon, certain, trigger, events, relevant, to, a, particular, counterparty, such, as, among, other, things, credit, ratings, value, of, assets, under, management, or, redemptions, over, a, specific, time, frame, e, g, quarterly, annually, in, finance, a, futures, contract, more, colloquially, futures, is, a, standardized, contract, between, two, parties, to, buy, or, sell, a, specified, asset, of, standardized, quantity, and, quality, for, a, price, agreed, upon, today, the, futures, price, with, delivery, and, payment, occurring, at, a, specified, future, date, the, delivery, date, making, it, a, derivative, product, i, e, a, financial, product, that, is, derived, from, an, underlying, asset, the, contracts, are, negotiated, at, a, futures, exchange, which, acts, as, an, intermediary, between, buyer, and, seller, the, party, agreeing, to, buy, the, underlying, asset, in, the, future, the, buyer, of, the, contract, is, said, to, be, long, and, the, party, agreeing, to, sell, the, asset, in, the, future, the, seller, of, the, contract, is, said, to, be, short, while, the, futures, contract, specifies, a, trade, taking, place, in, the, future, the, purpose, of, the, futures, exchange, is, to, act, as, intermediary, and, mitigate, the, risk, of, default, by, either, party, in, the, intervening, period, for, this, reason, the, futures, exchange, requires, both, parties, to, put, up, an, initial, amount, of, cash, performance, bond, the, margin, margins, sometimes, set, as, a, percentage, of, the, value, of, the, futures, contract, need, to, be, proportionally, maintained, at, all, times, during, the, life, of, the, contract, to, underpin, this, mitigation, because, the, price, of, the, contract, will, vary, in, keeping, with, supply, and, demand, and, will, change, daily, and, thus, one, party, or, the, other, will, theoretically, be, making, or, losing, money, to, mitigate, risk, and, the, possibility, of, default, by, either, party, the, product, is, marked, to, market, on, a, daily, basis, whereby, the, difference, between, the, prior, agreed, upon, price, and, the, actual, daily, futures, price, is, settled, on, a, daily, basis, this, is, sometimes, known, as, the, variation, margin, where, the, futures, exchange, will, draw, money, out, of, the, losing, party, s, margin, account, and, put, it, into, the, other, party, s, thus, ensuring, that, the, correct, daily, loss, or, profit, is, reflected, in, the, respective, account, if, the, margin, account, goes, below, a, certain, value, set, by, the, exchange, then, a, margin, call, is, made, and, the, account, owner, must, replenish, the, margin, account, this, process, is, known, as, marking, to, market, thus, on, the, delivery, date, the, amount, exchanged, is, not, the, specified, price, on, the, contract, but, the, spot, value, i, e, the, original, value, agreed, upon, since, any, gain, or, loss, has, already, been, previously, settled, by, marking, to, market, upon, marketing, the, strike, price, is, often, reached, and, creates, much, income, for, the, caller, a, closely, related, contract, is, a, forward, contract, a, forward, is, like, a, futures, in, that, it, specifies, the, exchange, of, goods, for, a, specified, price, at, a, specified, future, date, however, a, forward, is, not, traded, on, an, exchange, and, thus, does, not, have, the, interim, partial, payments, due, to, marking, to, market, nor, is, the, contract, standardized, as, on, the, exchange, unlike, an, option, both, parties, of, a, futures, contract, must, fulfill, the, contract, on, the, delivery, date, the, seller, delivers, the, underlying, asset, to, the, buyer, or, if, it, is, a, cash, settled, futures, contract, then, cash, is, transferred, from, the, futures, trader, who, sustained, a, loss, to, the, one, who, made, a, profit, to, exit, the, commitment, prior, to, the, settlement, date, the, holder, of, a, futures, position, can, close, out, its, contract, obligations, by, taking, the, opposite, position, on, another, futures, contract, on, the, same, asset, and, settlement, date, the, difference, in, futures, prices, is, then, a, profit, or, loss, a, mortgage, backed, security, mbs, is, an, asset, backed, security, that, is, secured, by, a, mortgage, or, more, commonly, a, collection, pool, of, sometimes, hundreds, of, mortgages, the, mortgages, are, sold, to, a, group, of, individuals, a, government, agency, or, investment, bank, that, securitizes, or, packages, the, loans, together, into, a, security, that, can, be, sold, to, investors, the, mortgages, of, an, mbs, may, be, residential, or, commercial, depending, on, whether, it, is, an, agency, mbs, or, a, non, agency, mbs, in, the, united, states, they, may, be, issued, by, structures, set, up, by, government, sponsored, enterprises, like, fannie, mae, or, freddie, mac, or, they, can, be, private, label, issued, by, structures, set, up, by, investment, banks, the, structure, of, the, mbs, may, be, known, as, pass, through, where, the, interest, and, principal, payments, from, the, borrower, or, homebuyer, pass, through, it, to, the, mbs, holder, or, it, may, be, more, complex, made, up, of, a, pool, of, other, mbss, other, types, of, mbs, include, collateralized, mortgage, obligations, cmos, often, structured, as, real, estate, mortgage, investment, conduits, and, collateralized, debt, obligations, cdos, the, shares, of, subprime, mbss, issued, by, various, structures, such, as, cmos, are, not, identical, but, rather, issued, as, tranches, french, for, slices, each, with, a, different, level, of, priority, in, the, debt, repayment, stream, giving, them, different, levels, of, risk, and, reward, tranches, especially, the, lower, priority, higher, interest, tranches, of, an, mbs, are, were, often, further, repackaged, and, resold, as, collaterized, debt, obligations, these, subprime, mbss, issued, by, investment, banks, were, a, major, issue, in, the, subprime, mortgage, crisis, of, 2006, 2008, the, total, face, value, of, an, mbs, decreases, over, time, because, like, mortgages, and, unlike, bonds, and, most, other, fixed, income, securities, the, principal, in, an, mbs, is, not, paid, back, as, a, single, payment, to, the, bond, holder, at, maturity, but, rather, is, paid, along, with, the, interest, in, each, periodic, payment, monthly, quarterly, etc, this, decrease, in, face, value, is, measured, by, the, mbs, s, factor, the, percentage, of, the, original, face, that, remains, to, be, repaid, in, finance, an, option, is, a, contract, which, gives, the, buyer, the, owner, the, right, but, not, the, obligation, to, buy, or, sell, an, underlying, asset, or, instrument, at, a, specified, strike, price, on, or, before, a, specified, date, the, seller, has, the, corresponding, obligation, to, fulfill, the, transaction, that, is, to, sell, or, buy, if, the, buyer, owner, exercises, the, option, the, buyer, pays, a, premium, to, the, seller, for, this, right, an, option, that, conveys, to, the, owner, the, right, to, buy, something, at, a, certain, price, is, a, call, option, an, option, that, conveys, the, right, of, the, owner, to, sell, something, at, a, certain, price, is, a, put, option, both, are, commonly, traded, but, for, clarity, the, call, option, is, more, frequently, discussed, options, valuation, is, a, topic, of, ongoing, research, in, academic, and, practical, finance, in, basic, terms, the, value, of, an, option, is, commonly, decomposed, into, two, parts, although, options, valuation, has, been, studied, since, the, 19th, century, the, contemporary, approach, is, based, on, the, black, scholes, model, which, was, first, published, in, 1973, options, contracts, have, been, known, for, many, centuries, however, both, trading, activity, and, academic, interest, increased, when, as, from, 1973, options, were, issued, with, standardized, terms, and, traded, through, a, guaranteed, clearing, house, at, the, chicago, board, options, exchange, today, many, options, are, created, in, a, standardized, form, and, traded, through, clearing, houses, on, regulated, options, exchanges, while, other, over, the, counter, options, are, written, as, bilateral, customized, contracts, between, a, single, buyer, and, seller, one, or, both, of, which, may, be, a, dealer, or, market, maker, options, are, part, of, a, larger, class, of, financial, instruments, known, as, derivative, products, or, simply, derivatives, a, swap, is, a, derivative, in, which, two, counterparties, exchange, cash, flows, of, one, party, s, financial, instrument, for, those, of, the, other, party, s, financial, instrument, the, benefits, in, question, depend, on, the, type, of, financial, instruments, involved, for, example, in, the, case, of, a, swap, involving, two, bonds, the, benefits, in, question, can, be, the, periodic, interest, coupon, payments, associated, with, such, bonds, specifically, two, counterparties, agree, to, the, exchange, one, stream, of, cash, flows, against, another, stream, these, streams, are, called, the, swap, s, legs, the, swap, agreement, defines, the, dates, when, the, cash, flows, are, to, be, paid, and, the, way, they, are, accrued, and, calculated, usually, at, the, time, when, the, contract, is, initiated, at, least, one, of, these, series, of, cash, flows, is, determined, by, an, uncertain, variable, such, as, a, floating, interest, rate, foreign, exchange, rate, equity, price, or, commodity, price, the, cash, flows, are, calculated, over, a, notional, principal, amount, contrary, to, a, future, a, forward, or, an, option, the, notional, amount, is, usually, not, exchanged, between, counterparties, consequently, swaps, can, be, in, cash, or, collateral, swaps, can, be, used, to, hedge, certain, risks, such, as, interest, rate, risk, or, to, speculate, on, changes, in, the, expected, direction, of, underlying, prices, swaps, were, first, introduced, to, the, public, in, 1981, when, ibm, and, the, world, bank, entered, into, a, swap, agreement, today, swaps, are, among, the, most, heavily, traded, financial, contracts, in, the, world, the, total, amount, of, interest, rates, and, currency, swaps, outstanding, is, more, than, 348, trillion, in, 2010, according, to, the, bank, for, international, settlements, bis, the, five, generic, types, of, swaps, in, order, of, their, quantitative, importance, are, interest, rate, swaps, currency, swaps, credit, swaps, commodity, swaps, and, equity, swaps, there, are, many, other, types, some, of, the, salient, economic, functions, of, the, derivative, market, include, in, a, nutshell, there, is, a, substantial, increase, in, savings, and, investment, in, the, long, run, due, to, augmented, activities, by, derivative, market, participant, two, common, measures, of, value, are, for, exchange, traded, derivatives, market, price, is, usually, transparent, often, published, in, real, time, by, the, exchange, based, on, all, the, current, bids, and, offers, placed, on, that, particular, contract, at, any, one, time, complications, can, arise, with, otc, or, floor, traded, contracts, though, as, trading, is, handled, manually, making, it, difficult, to, automatically, broadcast, prices, in, particular, with, otc, contracts, there, is, no, central, exchange, to, collate, and, disseminate, prices, the, arbitrage, free, price, for, a, derivatives, contract, can, be, complex, and, there, are, many, different, variables, to, consider, arbitrage, free, pricing, is, a, central, topic, of, financial, mathematics, for, futures, forwards, the, arbitrage, free, price, is, relatively, straightforward, involving, the, price, of, the, underlying, together, with, the, cost, of, carry, income, received, less, interest, costs, although, there, can, be, complexities, however, for, options, and, more, complex, derivatives, pricing, involves, developing, a, complex, pricing, model, understanding, the, stochastic, process, of, the, price, of, the, underlying, asset, is, often, crucial, a, key, equation, for, the, theoretical, valuation, of, options, is, the, black, scholes, formula, which, is, based, on, the, assumption, that, the, cash, flows, from, a, european, stock, option, can, be, replicated, by, a, continuous, buying, and, selling, strategy, using, only, the, stock, a, simplified, version, of, this, valuation, technique, is, the, binomial, options, model, otc, represents, the, biggest, challenge, in, using, models, to, price, derivatives, since, these, contracts, are, not, publicly, traded, no, market, price, is, available, to, validate, the, theoretical, valuation, most, of, the, model, s, results, are, input, dependent, meaning, the, final, price, depends, heavily, on, how, we, derive, the, pricing, inputs, therefore, it, is, common, that, otc, derivatives, are, priced, by, independent, agents, that, both, counterparties, involved, in, the, deal, designate, upfront, when, signing, the, contract, derivatives, are, often, subject, to, the, following, criticisms, particularly, since, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crisis, the, discipline, of, risk, management, has, developed, attempting, to, address, the, below, and, other, risks, see, financial, risk, management, banking, according, to, raghuram, rajan, a, former, chief, economist, of, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, it, may, well, be, that, the, managers, of, these, firms, have, figured, out, the, correlations, between, the, various, instruments, they, hold, and, believe, they, are, hedged, yet, as, chan, and, others, 2005, point, out, the, lessons, of, summer, 1998, following, the, default, on, russian, government, debt, is, that, correlations, that, are, zero, or, negative, in, normal, times, can, turn, overnight, to, one, a, phenomenon, they, term, phase, lock, in, a, hedged, position, can, become, unhedged, at, the, worst, times, inflicting, substantial, losses, on, those, who, mistakenly, believe, they, are, protected, see, the, frtb, framework, which, seeks, to, address, this, to, some, extent, the, use, of, derivatives, can, result, in, large, losses, because, of, the, use, of, leverage, or, borrowing, derivatives, allow, investors, to, earn, large, returns, from, small, movements, in, the, underlying, asset, s, price, however, investors, could, lose, large, amounts, if, the, price, of, the, underlying, moves, against, them, significantly, there, have, been, several, instances, of, massive, losses, in, derivative, markets, such, as, the, following, derivatives, typically, have, a, large, notional, value, as, such, there, is, the, danger, that, their, use, could, result, in, losses, for, which, the, investor, would, be, unable, to, compensate, the, possibility, that, this, could, lead, to, a, chain, reaction, ensuing, in, an, economic, crisis, was, pointed, out, by, famed, investor, warren, buffett, in, berkshire, hathaway, s, 2002, annual, report, buffett, called, them, financial, weapons, of, mass, destruction, a, potential, problem, with, derivatives, is, that, they, comprise, an, increasingly, larger, notional, amount, of, assets, which, may, lead, to, distortions, in, the, underlying, capital, and, equities, markets, themselves, investors, begin, to, look, at, the, derivatives, markets, to, make, a, decision, to, buy, or, sell, securities, and, so, what, was, originally, meant, to, be, a, market, to, transfer, risk, now, becomes, a, leading, indicator, see, berkshire, hathaway, annual, report, for, 2002, some, derivatives, especially, swaps, expose, investors, to, counterparty, risk, or, risk, arising, from, the, other, party, in, a, financial, transaction, counterparty, risk, results, from, the, differences, in, the, current, price, versus, the, expected, future, settlement, price, different, types, of, derivatives, have, different, levels, of, counter, party, risk, for, example, standardized, stock, options, by, law, require, the, party, at, risk, to, have, a, certain, amount, deposited, with, the, exchange, showing, that, they, can, pay, for, any, losses, banks, that, help, businesses, swap, variable, for, fixed, rates, on, loans, may, do, credit, checks, on, both, parties, however, in, private, agreements, between, two, companies, for, example, there, may, not, be, benchmarks, for, performing, due, diligence, and, risk, analysis, under, us, law, and, the, laws, of, most, other, developed, countries, derivatives, have, special, legal, exemptions, that, make, them, a, particularly, attractive, legal, form, to, extend, credit, the, strong, creditor, protections, afforded, to, derivatives, counterparties, in, combination, with, their, complexity, and, lack, of, transparency, however, can, cause, capital, markets, to, underprice, credit, risk, this, can, contribute, to, credit, booms, and, increase, systemic, risks, indeed, the, use, of, derivatives, to, conceal, credit, risk, from, third, parties, while, protecting, derivative, counterparties, contributed, to, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crisis, in, the, united, states, in, the, context, of, a, 2010, examination, of, the, ice, trust, an, industry, self, regulatory, body, gary, gensler, the, chairman, of, the, commodity, futures, trading, commission, which, regulates, most, derivatives, was, quoted, saying, that, the, derivatives, marketplace, as, it, functions, now, adds, up, to, higher, costs, to, all, americans, more, oversight, of, the, banks, in, this, market, is, needed, he, also, said, additionally, the, report, said, he, department, of, justice, is, looking, into, derivatives, too, the, department, s, antitrust, unit, is, actively, investigating, the, possibility, of, anticompetitive, practices, in, the, credit, derivatives, clearing, trading, and, information, services, industries, according, to, a, department, spokeswoman, for, legislators, and, committees, responsible, for, financial, reform, related, to, derivatives, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, distinguishing, between, hedging, and, speculative, derivatives, activities, has, been, a, nontrivial, challenge, the, distinction, is, critical, because, regulation, should, help, to, isolate, and, curtail, speculation, with, derivatives, especially, for, systemically, significant, institutions, whose, default, could, be, large, enough, to, threaten, the, entire, financial, system, at, the, same, time, the, legislation, should, allow, for, responsible, parties, to, hedge, risk, without, unduly, tying, up, working, capital, as, collateral, that, firms, may, better, employ, elsewhere, in, their, operations, and, investment, in, this, regard, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, financial, e, g, banks, and, non, financial, end, users, of, derivatives, e, g, real, estate, development, companies, because, these, firms, derivatives, usage, is, inherently, different, more, importantly, the, reasonable, collateral, that, secures, these, different, counterparties, can, be, very, different, the, distinction, between, these, firms, is, not, always, straight, forward, e, g, hedge, funds, or, even, some, private, equity, firms, do, not, neatly, fit, either, category, finally, even, financial, users, must, be, differentiated, as, large, banks, may, classified, as, systemically, significant, whose, derivatives, activities, must, be, more, tightly, monitored, and, restricted, than, those, of, smaller, local, and, regional, banks, over, the, counter, dealing, will, be, less, common, as, the, dodd, frank, wall, street, reform, and, consumer, protection, act, comes, into, effect, the, law, mandated, the, clearing, of, certain, swaps, at, registered, exchanges, and, imposed, various, restrictions, on, derivatives, to, implement, dodd, frank, the, cftc, developed, new, rules, in, at, least, 30, areas, the, commission, determines, which, swaps, are, subject, to, mandatory, clearing, and, whether, a, derivatives, exchange, is, eligible, to, clear, a, certain, type, of, swap, contract, nonetheless, the, above, and, other, challenges, of, the, rule, making, process, have, delayed, full, enactment, of, aspects, of, the, legislation, relating, to, derivatives, the, challenges, are, further, complicated, by, the, necessity, to, orchestrate, globalized, financial, reform, among, the, nations, that, comprise, the, world, s, major, financial, markets, a, primary, responsibility, of, the, financial, stability, board, whose, progress, is, ongoing, in, the, u, s, by, february, 2012, the, combined, effort, of, the, sec, and, cftc, had, produced, over, 70, proposed, and, final, derivatives, rules, however, both, of, them, had, delayed, adoption, of, a, number, of, derivatives, regulations, because, of, the, burden, of, other, rule, making, litigation, and, opposition, to, the, rules, and, many, core, definitions, such, as, the, terms, swap, security, based, swap, swap, dealer, security, based, swap, dealer, major, swap, participant, and, major, security, based, swap, participant, had, still, not, been, adopted, sec, chairman, mary, schapiro, opined, at, the, end, of, the, day, it, probably, does, not, make, sense, to, harmonize, everything, because, some, of, these, products, are, quite, different, and, certainly, the, market, structures, are, quite, different, on, february, 11, 2015, the, securities, and, exchange, commission, sec, released, two, final, rules, toward, establishing, a, reporting, and, public, disclosure, framework, for, security, based, swap, transaction, data, the, two, rules, are, not, completely, harmonized, with, the, requirements, with, cftc, requirements, in, november, 2012, the, sec, and, regulators, from, australia, brazil, the, european, union, hong, kong, japan, ontario, quebec, singapore, and, switzerland, met, to, discuss, reforming, the, otc, derivatives, market, as, had, been, agreed, by, leaders, at, the, 2009, g, 20, pittsburgh, summit, in, september, 2009, in, december, 2012, they, released, a, joint, statement, to, the, effect, that, they, recognized, that, the, market, is, a, global, one, and, firmly, support, the, adoption, and, enforcement, of, robust, and, consistent, standards, in, and, across, jurisdictions, with, the, goals, of, mitigating, risk, improving, transparency, protecting, against, market, abuse, preventing, regulatory, gaps, reducing, the, potential, for, arbitrage, opportunities, and, fostering, a, level, playing, field, for, market, participants, they, also, agreed, on, the, need, to, reduce, regulatory, uncertainty, and, provide, market, participants, with, sufficient, clarity, on, laws, and, regulations, by, avoiding, to, the, extent, possible, the, application, of, conflicting, rules, to, the, same, entities, and, transactions, and, minimizing, the, application, of, inconsistent, and, duplicative, rules, at, the, same, time, they, noted, that, complete, harmonization, perfect, alignment, of, rules, across, jurisdictions, would, be, difficult, because, of, jurisdictions, differences, in, law, policy, markets, implementation, timing, and, legislative, and, regulatory, processes, on, december, 20, 2013, the, cftc, provided, information, on, its, swaps, regulation, comparability, determinations, the, release, addressed, the, cftc, s, cross, border, compliance, exceptions, specifically, it, addressed, which, entity, level, and, in, some, cases, transaction, level, requirements, in, six, jurisdictions, australia, canada, the, european, union, hong, kong, japan, and, switzerland, it, found, comparable, to, its, own, rules, thus, permitting, non, us, swap, dealers, major, swap, participants, and, the, foreign, branches, of, us, swap, dealers, and, major, swap, participants, in, these, jurisdictions, to, comply, with, local, rules, in, lieu, of, commission, rules, mandatory, reporting, regulations, are, being, finalized, in, a, number, of, countries, such, as, dodd, frank, act, in, the, us, the, european, market, infrastructure, regulations, emir, in, europe, as, well, as, regulations, in, hong, kong, japan, singapore, canada, and, other, countries, the, otc, derivatives, regulators, forum, odrf, a, group, of, over, 40, worldwide, regulators, provided, trade, repositories, with, a, set, of, guidelines, regarding, data, access, to, regulators, and, the, financial, stability, board, and, cpss, iosco, also, made, recommendations, in, with, regard, to, reporting, dtcc, through, its, global, trade, repository, gtr, service,

plans, to, do, the, same, for, esma, in, europe, and, for, regulators, in, hong, kong, japan, and, singapore, it, covers, cleared, and, uncleared, otc, derivatives, products, whether, or, not, a, trade, is, electronically, processed, or, bespoke
