a, slang, is, a, vocabulary, words, phrases, and, linguistic, usages, of, an, informal, register, common, in, everyday, conversation, but, avoided, in, formal, writing, it, also, often, refers, to, the, language, exclusively, used, by, the, members, of, particular, in, groups, in, order, to, establish, group, identity, exclude, outsiders, or, both, the, word, itself, came, about, in, the, 18th, century, and, has, been, defined, in, multiple, ways, since, its, conception, with, no, single, technical, usage, in, linguistics, in, its, earliest, attested, use, 1756, the, word, slang, referred, to, the, vocabulary, of, low, or, disreputable, people, by, the, early, nineteenth, century, it, was, no, longer, exclusively, associated, with, disreputable, people, but, continued, to, be, applied, to, usages, below, the, level, of, standard, educated, speech, in, scots, dialect, it, meant, talk, chat, gossip, as, used, by, aberdeen, poet, william, scott, in, 1832, the, slang, gaed, on, aboot, their, war, ly, care, in, northern, english, dialect, it, meant, impertinence, abusive, language, the, origin, of, the, word, slang, is, unclear, it, was, first, used, in, print, around, 1800, to, refer, to, the, language, of, the, disreputable, and, criminal, classes, in, london, though, its, usage, likely, dates, back, further, a, scandinavian, origin, has, been, proposed, compare, for, example, norwegian, slengenavn, which, means, nickname, but, based, on, date, and, early, associations, is, discounted, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, jonathon, green, however, agrees, with, the, possibility, of, a, scandinavian, origin, suggesting, the, same, root, as, that, of, sling, which, means, to, throw, and, noting, that, slang, is, thrown, language, a, quick, and, honest, way, to, make, your, point, linguists, have, no, simple, and, clear, definition, of, slang, but, agree, that, it, is, a, constantly, changing, linguistic, phenomenon, present, in, every, subculture, worldwide, some, argue, that, slang, exists, because, we, must, come, up, with, ways, to, define, new, experiences, that, have, surfaced, with, time, and, modernity, attempting, to, remedy, the, lack, of, a, clear, definition, however, bethany, k, dumas, and, jonathan, lighter, argue, that, an, expression, should, be, considered, true, slang, if, it, meets, at, least, two, of, the, following, criteria, michael, adams, remarks, that, is, liminal, language, it, is, often, impossible, to, tell, even, in, context, which, interests, and, motives, it, serves, slang, is, on, the, edge, slang, dictionaries, collecting, thousands, of, slang, entries, offer, a, broad, empirical, window, into, the, motivating, forces, behind, slang, while, many, forms, of, lexicon, may, be, considered, low, register, or, sub, standard, slang, remains, distinct, from, colloquial, and, jargon, terms, because, of, its, specific, social, contexts, while, viewed, as, inappropriate, in, formal, usage, colloquial, terms, are, typically, considered, acceptable, in, speech, across, a, wide, range, of, contexts, whereas, slang, tends, to, be, perceived, as, inappropriate, in, many, common, communication, situations, jargon, refers, to, language, used, by, personnel, in, a, particular, field, or, to, language, used, to, represent, specific, terms, within, a, field, to, those, with, a, particular, interest, although, jargon, and, slang, can, both, be, used, to, exclude, non, group, members, from, the, conversation, slang, tends, to, emphasize, social, and, contextual, understanding, whereas, the, main, purpose, of, jargon, is, to, optimize, communication, using, terms, that, imply, technical, understanding, while, colloquialisms, and, jargon, may, seem, like, slang, because, they, reference, a, particular, group, they, do, not, necessarily, fit, the, same, definition, because, they, do, not, represent, a, particular, effort, to, replace, the, general, lexicon, of, a, standard, language, colloquialisms, are, considered, more, acceptable, and, more, expected, in, standard, usage, than, slang, is, and, jargon, is, often, created, to, talk, about, aspects, of, a, particular, field, that, are, not, accounted, for, in, the, general, lexicon, however, this, differentiation, is, not, consistently, applied, by, linguists, the, terms, slang, and, jargon, are, sometimes, treated, as, synonymous, and, the, scope, of, jargon, is, at, times, extended, to, mean, all, forms, of, socially, restricted, language, it, is, often, difficult, to, differentiate, slang, from, colloquialisms, and, even, high, register, lexicon, because, slang, generally, becomes, accepted, into, common, vocabulary, over, time, words, such, as, spurious, and, strenuous, were, once, perceived, as, slang, but, they, are, now, considered, general, even, high, register, words, some, literature, on, slang, even, says, that, mainstream, acceptance, of, a, slang, term, removes, its, status, as, true, slang, because, it, is, then, accepted, by, the, media, and, is, thus, no, longer, the, special, insider, speech, of, a, particular, group, for, example, black, american, music, frequently, uses, slang, and, many, of, its, frequently, used, terms, have, therefore, become, part, of, vernacular, english, some, say, that, a, general, test, for, whether, a, word, is, slang, or, not, is, whether, or, not, it, would, be, acceptable, in, an, academic, or, legal, setting, but, that, would, consider, slang, to, be, the, same, as, normal, everyday, informal, language, others, say, that, a, general, test, is, whether, the, word, has, been, entered, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, which, some, scholars, claim, changes, its, status, as, slang, it, is, often, difficult, to, collect, etymologies, for, slang, terms, largely, because, slang, is, a, phenomenon, of, speech, rather, than, written, language, and, etymologies, which, are, typically, traced, via, corpus, eric, partridge, cited, as, the, first, to, report, on, the, phenomenon, of, slang, in, a, systematic, and, linguistic, way, postulated, that, a, term, would, likely, be, in, circulation, for, a, decade, before, it, would, be, written, down, nevertheless, it, seems, that, slang, generally, forms, via, deviation, from, a, standard, form, this, spawning, of, slang, occurs, in, much, the, same, way, that, any, general, semantic, change, might, occur, the, difference, here, is, that, the, slang, term, s, new, meaning, takes, on, a, specific, social, significance, having, to, do, with, the, group, the, term, indexes, coleman, also, suggests, that, slang, is, differentiated, within, more, general, semantic, change, in, that, it, typically, has, to, do, with, a, certain, degree, of, playfulness, the, development, of, slang, is, considered, to, be, a, largely, spontaneous, lively, and, creative, speech, process, still, while, a, great, deal, of, slang, takes, off, even, becoming, accepted, into, the, standard, lexicon, much, slang, dies, out, sometimes, only, referencing, a, group, an, example, of, this, is, the, term, groovy, which, is, a, relic, of, 1960s, and, 70s, american, hippie, slang, nevertheless, for, a, slang, term, to, become, a, slang, term, people, must, use, it, at, some, point, in, time, as, a, way, to, flout, standard, language, additionally, slang, terms, may, be, borrowed, between, groups, such, as, the, term, gig, which, was, originally, coined, by, jazz, musicians, in, the, 1930s, and, then, borrowed, into, the, same, hippie, slang, of, the, 1960s, the, word, groovy, has, remained, a, part, of, subculture, lexicon, since, its, popularization, it, is, still, in, common, use, today, by, a, significant, population, the, word, gig, to, refer, to, a, performance, very, likely, originated, well, before, the, 1930s, and, remained, a, common, term, throughout, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, before, becoming, vaguely, associated, with, the, hippie, slang, of, the, 1960s, the, word, gig, is, now, a, widely, accepted, synonym, for, a, concert, recital, or, performance, of, any, type, generally, slang, terms, undergo, the, same, processes, of, semantic, change, that, words, in, the, regular, lexicon, do, slang, often, forms, from, words, with, previously, differing, meanings, one, example, is, the, often, used, and, popular, slang, word, lit, which, was, created, by, a, generation, labeled, generation, z, the, word, itself, used, to, be, associated, with, something, being, on, fire, or, being, lit, up, until, 1988, when, it, was, first, used, in, writing, to, indicate, a, person, who, was, drunk, in, the, book, warbirds, diary, of, an, unknown, aviator, since, this, time, lit, has, gained, popularity, through, rap, songs, such, as, asap, rocky, s, get, lit, in, 2011, as, the, popularity, of, the, word, has, increased, so, too, has, the, number, of, different, meanings, associated, with, the, word, now, lit, describes, a, person, who, is, drunk, and, or, high, as, well, as, an, event, that, is, especially, awesome, and, hype, words, and, phrases, from, popular, hollywood, films, and, television, series, frequently, become, slang, one, early, slang, like, code, thieves, cant, was, first, used, in, england, in, around, the, year, 1600, as, a, way, of, law, breakers, to, communicate, without, the, authorities, knowing, of, what, they, were, saying, slang, is, usually, associated, with, a, particular, social, group, and, plays, a, role, in, constructing, identity, while, slang, outlines, social, space, attitudes, about, slang, partly, construct, group, identity, and, identify, individuals, as, members, of, groups, therefore, using, the, slang, of, a, particular, group, associates, an, individual, with, that, group, michael, silverstein, s, orders, of, indexicality, can, be, employed, to, assign, a, slang, term, as, a, second, order, index, to, that, particular, group, using, a, slang, term, however, can, also, give, an, individual, the, qualities, associated, with, the, term, s, group, of, origin, whether, or, not, the, individual, is, trying, to, identify, as, a, member, of, the, group, this, allocation, of, qualities, based, on, abstract, group, association, is, known, as, third, order, indexicality, as, outlined, in, elisa, mattiello, s, book, an, introduction, to, english, slang, a, slang, term, can, assume, several, levels, of, meaning, and, can, be, used, for, many, reasons, connected, with, identity, for, example, male, adolescents, use, the, terms, foxy, and, shagadelic, to, show, their, belonging, to, a, band, to, stress, their, virility, or, their, age, to, reinforce, connection, with, their, peer, group, and, to, exclude, outsiders, to, show, off, etc, these, two, examples, use, both, traditional, and, nontraditional, methods, of, word, formation, to, create, words, with, more, meaning, and, expressiveness, than, the, more, direct, and, traditional, words, sexy, and, beautiful, from, the, semantic, point, of, view, slangy, foxy, is, more, loaded, than, neutral, sexy, in, terms, of, information, provided, that, is, for, young, people, foxy, means, having, the, quality, of, 1, attracting, interest, attention, affection, 2, causing, desire, 3, excellent, or, admirable, in, appearance, and, 4, sexually, provocative, exciting, etc, whereas, sexy, only, refers, to, the, quality, indicated, in, point, 4, matiello, stresses, that, those, agents, who, identify, themselves, as, young, men, have, genuinely, coined, these, terms, and, choose, to, use, them, over, canonical, terms, like, beautiful, or, sexy, because, of, the, indexicalized, social, identifications, the, former, convey, in, terms, of, first, and, second, order, indexicality, the, usage, of, speaker, oriented, terms, by, male, adolescents, indicated, their, membership, to, their, age, group, to, reinforce, connection, to, their, peer, group, and, to, exclude, outsiders, in, terms, of, higher, order, indexicality, anyone, using, these, terms, may, desire, to, appear, fresher, undoubtedly, more, playful, faddish, and, colourful, than, someone, who, employs, the, standard, english, term, beautiful, this, appearance, relies, heavily, on, the, hearer, s, third, order, understanding, of, the, term, s, associated, social, nuances, and, presupposed, use, cases, often, distinct, subcultures, will, create, slang, that, members, will, use, in, order, to, associate, themselves, with, the, group, or, to, delineate, outsiders, slang, terms, are, often, known, only, within, a, clique, or, ingroup, for, example, leet, leetspeak, or, 1337, was, originally, popular, only, among, certain, internet, subcultures, such, as, software, crackers, and, online, video, gamers, during, the, 1990s, and, into, the, early, 21st, century, however, leet, became, increasingly, commonplace, on, the, internet, and, it, has, spread, outside, internet, based, communication, and, into, spoken, languages, other, types, of, slang, include, sms, language, used, on, mobile, phones, and, chatspeak, e, g, lol, an, acronym, meaning, laughing, out, loud, or, laugh, out, loud, or, rofl, rolling, on, the, floor, laughing, which, are, widely, used, in, instant, messaging, on, the, internet, as, subcultures, are, often, forms, of, counterculture, which, is, understood, to, oppose, the, norm, it, follows, that, slang, has, come, to, be, associated, with, counterculture, slang, is, often, adopted, from, social, media, as, a, sign, of, social, awareness, and, shared, knowledge, of, popular, culture, this, type, known, as, internet, slang, has, become, prevalent, since, the, early, 2000s, along, with, the, rise, in, popularity, of, social, networking, services, including, facebook, twitter, and, instagram, this, has, spawned, new, vocabularies, associated, with, each, new, social, media, venue, such, as, the, use, of, the, term, friending, on, facebook, which, is, a, verbification, of, friend, used, to, describe, the, process, of, adding, a, new, person, to, one, s, group, of, friends, on, the, website, despite, the, existence, of, an, analogous, term, befriend, this, term, is, much, older, than, facebook, but, has, only, recently, entered, the, popular, lexicon, other, examples, of, slang, in, social, media, demonstrate, a, proclivity, toward, shortened, words, or, acronyms, these, are, especially, associated, with, services, such, as, twitter, which, as, of, november, 2017, has, a, 280, character, limit, for, each, message, and, therefore, requires, a, relatively, brief, mode, of, expression, this, includes, the, use, of, hashtags, which, explicitly, state, the, main, content, of, a, message, or, image, such, as, food, or, photography, some, critics, believe, that, when, slang, becomes, more, commonplace, it, effectively, eradicates, the, proper, use, of, a, certain, language, however, academic, descriptive, linguists, believe, that, language, is, not, static, but, ever, changing, and, that, slang, terms, are, valid, words, within, a, language, s, lexicon, while, prescriptivists, study, and, promote, the, socially, preferable, or, correct, ways, to, speak, according, to, a, language, s, normative, grammar, and, syntactical, words, descriptivists, focus, on, studying, language, to, further, understand, the, subconscious, rules, of, how, individuals, speak, which, makes, slang, important, in, understanding, such, rules, noam, chomsky, a, founder, of, anthropological, linguistic, thought, challenged, structural, and, prescriptive, grammar, and, began, to, study, sounds, and, morphemes, functionally, as, well, as, their, changes, within, a, language, over, time, the, 1941, film, ball, of, fire, portrays, a, professor, played, by, gary, cooper, who, is, researching, and, writing, an, encyclopedia, article, about, slang, the, 2006, film, idiocracy, portrays, a, less, intelligent, society, in, the, year, 2505, that, has, people, who, use, all, various, sorts, of, aggressive, slang, these, slangs, sound, very, foreign, and, alienating, to, the, protagonist, of, the, movie, a, us, army, librarian
