in, linguistics, language, death, occurs, when, a, language, loses, its, last, native, speaker, by, extension, language, extinction, is, when, the, language, is, no, longer, known, including, by, second, language, speakers, when, it, becomes, known, as, an, extinct, language, a, related, term, is, linguicide, the, death, of, a, language, from, natural, or, political, causes, and, rarely, glottophagy, the, absorption, or, replacement, of, a, minor, language, by, a, major, language, language, death, is, a, process, in, which, the, level, of, a, speech, community, s, linguistic, competence, in, their, language, variety, decreases, eventually, resulting, in, no, native, or, fluent, speakers, of, the, variety, language, death, can, affect, any, language, form, including, dialects, language, death, should, not, be, confused, with, language, attrition, also, called, language, loss, which, describes, the, loss, of, proficiency, in, a, first, language, of, an, individual, in, the, modern, period, c, 1500, ce, present, following, the, rise, of, colonialism, language, death, has, typically, resulted, from, the, process, of, cultural, assimilation, leading, to, language, shift, and, the, gradual, abandonment, of, a, native, language, in, favour, of, a, foreign, lingua, franca, largely, those, of, european, countries, as, of, the, 2000s, a, total, of, roughly, 7, 000, natively, spoken, languages, existed, worldwide, most, of, these, are, minor, languages, in, danger, of, extinction, one, estimate, published, in, 2004, expected, that, some, 90, of, the, currently, spoken, languages, will, have, become, extinct, by, 2050, ethnologue, recorded, 7, 358, living, languages, known, in, 2001, but, on, 20, may, 2015, ethnologue, reported, only, 7, 102, known, living, languages, and, on, 23, february, 2016, ethnologue, reported, only, 7, 097, known, living, languages, language, death, is, typically, the, outcome, of, language, shift, and, may, manifest, itself, in, one, of, the, following, ways, the, most, common, process, leading, to, language, death, is, one, in, which, a, community, of, speakers, of, one, language, becomes, bilingual, with, another, language, and, gradually, shifts, allegiance, to, the, second, language, until, they, cease, to, use, their, original, heritage, language, this, is, a, process, of, assimilation, which, may, be, voluntary, or, may, be, forced, upon, a, population, speakers, of, some, languages, particularly, regional, or, minority, languages, may, decide, to, abandon, them, because, of, economic, or, utilitarian, reasons, in, favor, of, languages, regarded, as, having, greater, utility, or, prestige, languages, with, a, small, geographically, isolated, population, of, speakers, can, die, when, their, speakers, are, wiped, out, by, genocide, disease, or, natural, disaster, a, language, is, often, declared, to, be, dead, even, before, the, last, native, speaker, of, the, language, has, died, if, there, are, only, a, few, elderly, speakers, of, a, language, remaining, and, they, no, longer, use, that, language, for, communication, then, the, language, is, effectively, dead, a, language, that, has, reached, such, a, reduced, stage, of, use, is, generally, considered, moribund, half, of, the, spoken, languages, of, the, world, are, not, being, taught, to, new, generations, of, children, once, a, language, is, no, longer, a, native, language, that, is, if, no, children, are, being, socialized, into, it, as, their, primary, language, the, process, of, transmission, is, ended, and, the, language, itself, will, not, survive, past, the, current, generations, language, death, is, rarely, a, sudden, event, but, a, slow, process, of, each, generation, learning, less, and, less, of, the, language, until, its, use, is, relegated, to, the, domain, of, traditional, use, such, as, in, poetry, and, song, typically, the, transmission, of, the, language, from, adults, to, children, becomes, more, and, more, restricted, to, the, final, setting, that, adults, speaking, the, language, will, raise, children, who, never, acquire, fluency, one, example, of, this, process, reaching, its, conclusion, is, that, of, the, dalmatian, language, during, language, loss, sometimes, referred, to, as, obsolescence, in, the, linguistic, literature, the, language, that, is, being, lost, generally, undergoes, changes, as, speakers, make, their, language, more, similar, to, the, language, to, which, they, are, shifting, this, process, of, change, has, been, described, by, appel, 1983, in, two, categories, though, they, are, not, mutually, exclusive, often, speakers, replace, elements, of, their, own, language, with, something, from, the, language, they, are, shifting, toward, also, if, their, heritage, language, has, an, element, that, the, new, language, does, not, speakers, may, drop, it, within, indigenous, communities, the, death, of, language, has, consequences, for, individuals, and, the, communities, as, a, whole, there, have, been, links, made, between, their, health, both, physically, and, mentally, and, the, death, of, their, traditional, language, language, is, an, important, part, of, their, identity, and, as, such, is, linked, to, their, well, being, one, study, conducted, on, aboriginal, youth, suicide, rates, in, canada, found, that, indigenous, communities, in, which, a, majority, of, members, speak, the, traditional, language, exhibit, low, suicide, rates, while, suicide, rates, were, six, times, higher, in, groups, where, less, than, half, of, its, members, communicate, in, their, ancestral, language, another, study, was, also, conducted, on, aboriginal, peoples, in, alberta, canada, and, there, was, a, link, found, between, their, traditional, language, knowledge, and, the, prevalence, of, diabetes, the, greater, their, knowledge, was, of, their, traditional, language, the, lower, the, prevalence, of, diabetes, was, within, their, communities, language, revitalization, is, an, attempt, to, slow, or, reverse, language, death, revitalization, programs, are, ongoing, in, many, languages, and, have, had, varying, degrees, of, success, the, revival, of, the, hebrew, language, in, israel, is, the, only, example, of, a, language, s, acquiring, new, first, language, speakers, after, it, became, extinct, in, everyday, use, for, an, extended, period, being, used, only, as, a, liturgical, language, even, in, the, case, of, hebrew, there, is, a, theory, that, argues, that, the, hebrew, revivalists, who, wished, to, speak, pure, hebrew, failed, the, result, is, a, fascinating, and, multifaceted, israeli, language, which, is, not, only, multi, layered, but, also, multi, sourced, the, revival, of, a, clinically, dead, language, is, unlikely, without, cross, fertilization, from, the, revivalists, mother, tongue, s, other, cases, of, language, revitalization, which, have, seen, some, degree, of, success, are, welsh, basque, hawaiian, and, navajo, reasons, for, language, revitalization, vary, they, can, include, physical, danger, affecting, those, whose, language, is, dying, economic, danger, such, as, the, exploitation, of, natural, resources, political, danger, such, as, genocide, or, cultural, danger, such, as, assimilation, during, the, past, century, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, 2, 000, languages, have, already, become, extinct, the, united, nations, un, estimates, that, more, than, half, of, the, languages, spoken, today, have, fewer, than, 10, 000, speakers, and, that, a, quarter, have, fewer, than, 1, 000, speakers, and, that, unless, there, are, some, efforts, to, maintain, them, over, the, next, hundred, years, most, of, these, will, become, extinct, these, figures, are, often, cited, as, reasons, why, language, revitalization, is, necessary, to, preserve, linguistic, diversity, culture, and, identity, are, also, frequently, cited, reasons, for, language, revitalization, when, a, language, is, perceived, as, a, unique, cultural, treasure, a, community, often, sees, language, as, a, unique, part, of, their, culture, connecting, them, with, their, ancestors, or, with, the, land, making, up, an, essential, part, of, their, history, and, self, image, according, to, ghil, ad, zuckermann, language, reclamation, will, become, increasingly, relevant, as, people, seek, to, recover, their, cultural, autonomy, empower, their, spiritual, and, intellectual, sovereignty, and, improve, wellbeing, there, are, various, ethical, aesthetic, and, utilitarian, benefits, of, language, revival, for, example, historical, justice, diversity, and, employability, respectively, google, launched, the, endangered, languages, project, aimed, at, helping, preserve, languages, that, are, at, risk, of, extinction, its, goal, is, to, compile, up, to, date, information, about, endangered, languages, and, share, the, latest, research, about, them, anthropologist, akira, yamamoto, has, identified, nine, factors, that, he, believes, will, help, prevent, language, death, linguists, distinguish, between, language, death, and, the, process, where, a, language, becomes, a, dead, language, through, normal, language, change, a, linguistic, phenomenon, analogous, to, pseudoextinction, this, happens, when, a, language, in, the, course, of, its, normal, development, gradually, morphs, into, something, that, is, then, recognized, as, a, separate, different, language, leaving, the, old, form, with, no, native, speakers, thus, for, example, old, english, may, be, regarded, as, a, dead, language, although, it, changed, and, developed, into, middle, english, early, modern, english, and, modern, english, dialects, of, a, language, can, also, die, contributing, to, the, overall, language, death, for, example, the, ainu, language, is, slowly, dying, the, unesco, atlas, of, the, world, s, languages, in, danger, lists, hokkaido, ainu, as, critically, endangered, with, 15, speakers, and, both, sakhalin, and, kuril, ainu, as, extinct, the, language, vitality, for, ainu, has, weakened, because, of, japanese, becoming, the, favoured, language, for, education, since, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, education, in, japanese, heavily, impacted, the, decline, in, use, of, the, ainu, language, because, of, forced, linguistic, assimilation, the, process, of, language, change, may, also, involve, the, splitting, up, of, a, language, into, a, family, of, several, daughter, languages, leaving, the, common, parent, language, dead, this, has, happened, to, latin, which, through, vulgar, latin, eventually, developed, into, the, romance, languages, and, to, sanskrit, which, through, prakrit, developed, into, the, new, indo, aryan, languages, such, a, process, is, normally, not, described, as, language, death, because, it, involves, an, unbroken, chain, of, normal, transmission, of, the, language, from, one, generation, to, the, next, with, only, minute, changes, at, every, single, point, in, the, chain, thus, with, regard, to, latin, for, example, there, is, no, point, at, which, latin, died, it, evolved, in, different, ways, in, different, geographic, areas, and, its, modern, forms, are, now, identified, by, a, plethora, of, different, names, such, as, french, portuguese, spanish, italian, etc, language, shift, can, be, used, to, understand, the, evolution, of, latin, into, the, various, modern, forms, language, shift, which, could, lead, to, language, death, occurs, because, of, a, shift, in, language, behaviour, from, a, speech, community, contact, with, other, languages, and, cultures, causes, change, in, behaviour, to, the, original, language, which, creates, language, shift, except, in, case, of, linguicide, languages, do, not, suddenly, become, extinct, they, become, moribund, as, the, community, of, speakers, gradually, shifts, to, using, other, languages, as, speakers, shift, there, are, discernible, if, subtle, changes, in, language, behavior, these, changes, in, behavior, lead, to, a, change, of, linguistic, vitality, in, the, community, there, are, a, variety, of, systems, that, have, been, proposed, for, measuring, the, vitality, of, a, language, in, a, community, one, of, the, earliest, is, the, gids, graded, intergenerational, disruption, scale, proposed, by, joshua, fishman, in, 1991, a, noteworthy, publishing, milestone, in, measuring, language, vitality, is, an, entire, issue, of, journal, of, multilingual, and, multicultural, development, devoted, to, the, study, of, ethnolinguistic, vitality, vol, 32, 2, 2011, with, several, authors, presenting, their, own, tools, for, measuring, language, vitality, a, number, of, other, published, works, on, measuring, language, vitality, have, been, published, prepared, by, authors, with, varying, situations, and, applications, in, mind, these, include, works, by, arienne, dwyer, martin, ehala, m, lynne, landwehr, mark, karan, andr, s, kornai, and, paul, lewis, and, gary, simons
