the, revolution, reports, of, clashes, and, violence, by, militia, groups, have, been, increasing, mexico, has, a, history, of, various, activities, and, insurrection, by, militia, and, paramilitary, groups, dating, back, several, hundred, years, that, include, the, exploits, of, historical, figures, such, as, captain, manuel, pineda, munoz, and, francisco, pancho, villa, this, also, includes, groups, such, as, the, free, colored, militia, the, interracial, militias, of, new, spain, colonial, mexico, the, camisas, doradas, and, the, contemporary, self, defense, council, of, michoacan, free, colored, militias, were, an, important, and, at, times, critical, organization, in, colonial, mexico, prior, to, the, eighteenth, century, spain, s, territories, in, the, americas, were, mainly, defended, through, a, series, of, spanish, military, units, being, based, in, strategic, coastal, port, cities, and, important, economic, centers, 8, 10, but, as, european, rivals, began, to, challenge, the, spanish, crown, and, their, dominance, in, the, new, world, the, bourbon, dynasty, initiated, a, series, of, reforms, allowing, people, from, their, colonies, to, serve, in, the, regular, armies, as, well, as, permitting, local, militias, in, their, territories, 14, 16, while, these, groups, began, to, integrate, themselves, into, the, official, spanish, colonial, militaries, free, colored, militias, have, been, reluctantly, used, since, the, mid, sixteenth, century, palenques, or, run, away, slave, communities, would, often, initiate, slavery, uprising, in, various, cities, and, towns, in, new, spain, which, made, the, colonial, spanish, authorities, uneasy, about, arming, any, free, colored, individuals, 14, 16, free, colored, rebellions, and, violence, in, mexico, city, impacted, regional, policy, of, new, spain, towards, blacks, given, this, social, context, the, racial, climate, in, which, these, free, colored, militias, first, appeared, was, a, hostile, one, and, the, first, militias, often, had, conflicts, within, them, between, their, free, colored, and, white, commanders, 20, 23, the, first, large, scale, recruitment, of, fee, colored, militias, was, in, response, to, the, attack, on, veracruz, port, in, 1683, by, dutch, pirateer, lorenzo, de, graff, with, free, colored, soldiers, being, called, in, from, mexico, city, puebla, orizaba, and, other, large, colonial, cities, 30, 32, militias, increasingly, began, to, take, shape, and, develop, over, the, course, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, but, it, s, critical, to, understand, that, their, development, was, not, a, linear, progressive, one, the, experiences, of, militias, in, urban, areas, was, vastly, different, from, those, in, rural, communities, and, the, role, influence, and, duties, of, militias, in, the, early, 17th, century, were, not, the, same, as, those, of, a, century, later, the, critical, stage, for, militia, growth, was, during, 1670, 1762, where, there, was, an, increase, of, the, militias, responsibilities, and, they, gained, a, considerable, amount, of, autonomy, over, their, own, affairs, 30, 32, the, social, impact, of, these, free, colored, militias, added, complexity, to, the, race, based, caste, system, that, dominated, the, social, landscape, free, colored, militias, were, structured, to, follow, the, tercio, organizational, model, that, was, used, by, spanish, habsburg, and, bourbon, dynasties, 47, 50, tercios, compromised, 2, 500, soldiers, distributed, among, ten, companies, each, under, the, leadership, of, a, captain, free, colored, militias, under, the, tercio, system, were, headed, by, a, sargento, mayor, major, who, became, the, senior, operating, officer, in, militias, under, the, sargento, mayor, were, the, junior, officers, which, included, one, captain, and, alferez, lieutenant, per, company, who, were, also, aided, by, an, ayudante, adjutant, and, subteniente, second, lieutenant, after, they, were, incorporated, into, the, system, after, 1767, the, captain, had, supreme, authority, within, their, company, only, reporting, to, the, sargento, mayor, when, he, could, not, control, matters, of, the, company, the, alferez, coordinated, affairs, with, his, captain, and, was, next, in, line, in, command, in, his, absence, below, the, junior, officers, were, ranking, nco, s, and, up, to, four, sergeants, served, per, company, a, cabo, corporal, was, assigned, to, lead, each, squad, of, 25, soldiers, these, nco, s, were, responsible, for, discipline, of, the, soldiers, and, maintaining, a, limited, record, of, individuals, 47, 50, officers, and, first, sergeants, were, the, only, soldiers, in, the, free, colored, militias, to, receive, a, monthly, salary, with, lower, ranked, soldiers, only, receiving, pay, when, on, campaigns, their, salaries, came, from, the, royal, treasuries, alongside, occasional, supplementation, by, private, contributions, of, prominent, individuals, 83, 84, who, exactly, constitutes, as, a, free, colored, person, is, subject, to, much, debate, and, discussion, while, the, terms, pardos, mulatos, negros, and, morenos, were, commonly, used, under, the, caste, system, that, was, in, place, during, this, era, their, use, in, this, context, is, much, more, complex, and, who, exactly, qualified, as, who, was, a, very, fluid, process, dependent, on, the, social, context, of, the, time, and, place, 200, 201, despite, the, lack, of, universal, understanding, of, racial, identification, across, new, spain, when, they, were, faced, with, external, threats, to, their, organizations, free, colored, militias, showed, great, racial, unity, in, these, times, such, as, in, the, case, of, huajolotitlan, a, small, town, of, oaxaca, in, southern, mexico, 207, 211, after, a, decree, was, passed, in, 1784, calling, for, the, retirement, of, every, free, colored, officer, and, the, disbandment, of, their, militia, the, tows, free, coloreds, fiercely, resisted, free, colored, soldiers, refused, to, leave, their, posts, and, they, dispatched, to, the, capital, in, protests, to, defend, their, racially, integrated, organizations, this, later, inspired, the, communities, other, free, colored, people, to, protests, what, they, saw, as, other, aggressions, by, the, government, such, as, increasing, tribute, burdens, 207, 211, while, some, of, the, previous, examples, are, historical, the, current, official, view, on, the, existence, of, such, militias, in, mexico, when, they, are, not, backed, by, the, government, has, been, to, always, label, them, as, illegal, and, to, combat, them, in, a, military, and, a, political, way, modern, examples, on, the, mexican, view, on, militias, are, the, chiapas, conflict, against, the, ezln, and, against, the, epr, in, guerrero, where, the, government, forces, combated, the, upraised, militias, and, in, a, more, recent, case, when, civilian, self, defence, militias, appeared, during, the, mexican, war, on, drugs, the, government, regulated, them, and, transformed, the, militias, in, to, rural, federal, forces, and, those, who, resisted, were, combated, and, imprisoned, in, 1910, king, nicholas, i, of, montenegro, proclaimed, that, all, male, citizens, were, members, of, a, national, militia, and, had, both, a, right, and, a, duty, to, own, at, least, one, gasser, pattern, revolver, under, penalty, of, law, the, official, reason, for, the, king, s, decree, was, to, create, an, armed, populace, that, would, deter, neighbouring, countries, from, attacking, montenegro, which, was, unable, to, field, a, large, army, however, it, was, widely, believed, in, montenegro, that, this, decision, was, actually, taken, because, the, king, owned, shares, in, leopold, gasser, waffenfabrik, in, vienna, the, patent, holder, and, sole, manufacturer, of, the, pistol, at, that, time, despite, this, the, decree, actually, obliged, montenegrin, adult, males, to, own, a, gasser, pattern, revolver, not, necessarily, one, made, by, gasser, itself, in, fact, leopold, gasser, was, faced, with, such, heavy, demand, for, the, pistol, internationally, that, it, could, not, fulfil, all, of, the, orders, placed, for, it, this, led, the, revolver, s, manufacturer, to, license, out, production, to, other, companies, and, many, gasser, pattern, pistols, were, then, manufactured, and, sold, by, other, european, firms, most, notably, based, out, of, belgium, and, spain, even, these, licensed, models, did, not, satiate, demand, for, the, pistol, and, this, alongside, a, lax, enforcement, of, intellectual, property, rights, in, montenegro, led, to, many, unlicensed, local, models, of, the, pistol, also, being, produced, with, quality, ranging, from, very, good, to, outright, dangerous, to, its, user, subsequently, the, weapon, quickly, became, a, status, symbol, for, montenegrin, men, and, was, commonly, worn, alongside, traditional, attire, many, montenegrin, immigrants, that, travelled, to, north, america, brought, their, gasser, pattern, revolvers, with, them, and, at, least, two, batches, of, several, thousand, pistols, were, smuggled, into, mexico, during, the, mexican, revolution, leading, to, the, gasser, revolver, becoming, widespread, in, the, americas, however, as, the, original, reason, for, their, mass, production, and, the, generation, that, grew, around, it, faded, the, pistol, eventually, lost, its, place, as, a, status, symbol, and, many, were, either, given, away, or, sold, in, the, secondhand, market, schutterij, dutch, pronunciation, refers, to, a, voluntary, city, guard, or, citizen, militia, in, the, medieval, and, early, modern, netherlands, intended, to, protect, the, town, or, city, from, attack, and, act, in, case, of, revolt, or, fire, their, training, grounds, were, often, on, open, spaces, within, the, city, near, the, city, walls, but, when, the, weather, did, not, allow, inside, a, church, they, are, mostly, grouped, according, to, their, district, and, to, the, weapon, that, they, used, bow, crossbow, or, gun, together, its, members, are, called, a, schuttersgilde, which, could, be, roughly, translated, as, a, shooter, s, guild, it, is, now, a, title, applied, to, ceremonial, shooting, clubs, and, to, the, country, s, olympic, rifle, team, from, the, treaty, of, waitangi, in, 1840, until, 1844, small, detachments, of, british, imperial, troops, based, in, new, zealand, were, the, only, military, this, changed, as, a, result, of, the, flagstaff, war, with, the, colonial, government, passing, a, militia, act, on, 25, march, 1845, militia, units, were, formed, in, auckland, wellington, new, plymouth, and, nelson, service, in, the, militia, was, compulsory, many, localized, militia, saw, service, together, with, british, imperial, troops, during, the, new, zealand, wars, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, a, system, of, local, volunteer, militias, evolved, throughout, the, country, these, were, semi, trained, but, uniformed, and, administered, by, a, small, number, of, regular, imperial, officers, the, militia, units, were, disbanded, and, reformed, as, the, territorial, army, in, 1911, the, worker, peasant, red, guards, is, a, north, korean, paramilitary, organization, organized, on, a, provincial, town, city, village, level, militias, have, played, an, important, role, supporting, pakistan, s, military, since, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1947, when, pakistan, with, the, support, of, militias, was, able, to, gain, control, of, parts, of, the, region, of, kashmir, pakistan, found, the, militias, volunteering, to, participate, in, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1965, and, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, quite, useful, as, well, currently, pakistani, citizens, forming, militias, from, the, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, province, are, participating, in, the, war, on, terror, portugal, has, a, long, tradition, in, the, use, of, militias, for, national, defense, between, the, 12th, and, 16th, centuries, the, municipal, militias, composed, of, spearmen, pikemen, horsemen, slingers, javelineers, archers, crossbowmen, and, later, arquebusiers, constituted, the, main, component, of, the, portuguese, royal, army, together, with, smaller, military, forces, from, the, king, the, military, orders, and, the, feudal, lords, after, some, failed, previous, attempts, in, 1570, king, sebastian, of, portugal, created, the, ordenan, as, a, centrally, managed, military, territorial, organization, that, would, replace, the, municipal, militias, and, became, the, basis, of, a, national, army, after, 60, years, of, foreign, domination, 1580, 1640, the, ordenan, as, were, reorganized, for, the, portuguese, restoration, war, the, portuguese, army, was, then, organized, in, three, lines, with, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, being, militia, forces, the, ordenan, as, became, the, 3rd, line, and, acted, both, as, a, territorial, draft, organization, for, the, 1st, and, 2nd, line, troops, and, as, a, kind, of, home, guard, for, local, defense, the, 2nd, line, was, made, of, the, auxiliary, troops, also, militia, units, with, the, role, of, regional, defense, in, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, auxiliary, troops, were, renamed, militias, in, the, peninsular, war, the, militia, regiments, and, the, ordenan, as, units, had, an, important, role, in, the, defense, of, the, country, against, the, napoleonic, invader, army, still, in, the, 19th, century, the, militia, units, also, had, an, important, role, in, the, liberal, wars, with, the, majority, of, those, troops, fighting, on, the, side, of, king, miguel, besides, the, regular, militias, a, number, of, volunteer, militia, units, were, formed, to, fight, on, both, sides, of, the, war, with, the, establishment, of, the, constitutional, regime, the, old, militias, and, ordenan, as, were, replaced, by, a, single, national, militia, force, the, national, guard, however, the, national, guard, revealed, itself, an, ineffective, and, undisciplined, force, their, units, became, highly, politicized, being, involved, in, a, number, of, conspiracies, and, coups, the, national, guard, having, less, and, less, confidence, from, the, authorities, became, extinct, in, 1847, terminating, a, long, tradition, of, national, militias, in, portugal, during, the, 20th, century, some, experiments, with, militia, type, forces, were, made, from, 1911, to, 1926, the, portuguese, army, was, organized, as, a, militia, army, also, in, 1936, the, estado, novo, regime, created, the, portuguese, legion, as, a, political, volunteer, militia, dedicated, to, the, fight, against, the, enemies, of, country, and, of, the, social, order, from, world, war, ii, the, portuguese, legion, assumed, the, responsibility, for, civil, defense, this, becoming, its, main, role, during, the, cold, war, until, its, extinction, in, 1974, neither, the, russian, empire, nor, the, soviet, union, ever, had, an, organised, force, that, could, be, equated, to, a, militia, instead, a, form, of, organisation, that, predated, the, russian, state, was, used, during, national, emergencies, called, narodnoe, opolcheniye, people, s, regimentation, more, comparable, to, the, english, fyrd, it, was, a, popular, voluntary, joining, of, the, local, polk, or, a, regiment, though, it, had, no, regular, established, strength, or, officers, these, usually, elected, from, prominent, local, citizens, the, tsarist, regime, was, particularly, reluctant, to, arm, and, organise, militia, forces, because, of, concern, over, a, repetition, of, the, pugachev, serf, revolt, of, the, late, 18th, century, only, in, the, face, of, the, national, emergency, of, 1812, was, the, raising, of, opolcheniye, cohorts, permitted, numbering, over, 223, 000, loosely, trained, and, barely, equipped, these, enthusiastic, volunteers, nevertheless, provided, a, useful, reserve, for, the, regular, army, although, these, spontaneously, created, popular, forces, had, participated, in, several, major, wars, of, the, russian, empire, including, in, combat, they, were, not, obligated, to, serve, for, more, than, one, year, and, notably, departed, for, home, during, the, 1813, campaign, in, germany, on, only, one, occasion, during, the, military, history, of, the, soviet, union, the, narodnoe, opolcheniye, was, incorporated, into, the, regular, forces, of, the, red, army, notably, in, leningrad, and, moscow, the, term, militsiya, in, russia, and, former, communist, bloc, nations, was, specifically, used, to, refer, to, the, civilian, police, force, and, should, not, be, confused, with, the, conventional, western, definition, of, militia, the, term, as, used, in, this, context, dated, from, post, revolutionary, russia, in, late, 1917, and, was, intended, to, draw, a, distinction, between, the, new, soviet, law, enforcement, agencies, and, the, disbanded, tsarist, police, in, some, of, these, states, such, as, ukraine, the, militia, were, renamed, as, police, while, in, other, states, e, g, belarus, the, title, remains, unchanged, in, russia, itself, the, militia, became, police, in, russian, politsiya, in, march, 2011, the, first, militias, formed, in, sri, lanka, were, by, lankan, kings, who, raised, militia, armies, for, their, military, campaigns, both, within, and, outside, the, island, this, was, due, to, the, reason, that, the, kings, never, maintained, a, standing, army, instead, had, a, royal, guard, during, peacetime, and, formed, a, militia, in, wartime, when, the, portuguese, who, were, the, first, colonial, power, to, dominate, the, island, raised, local, militias, under, the, command, of, local, leaders, known, as, mudaliyars, these, militias, took, part, in, the, many, portuguese, campaigns, against, the, lankan, kings, the, dutch, continued, to, employ, these, militias, but, due, to, their, unreliability, tended, to, favor, employing, swiss, and, malay, mercenaries, in, their, campaigns, in, the, island, the, british, empire, then, ousted, the, dutch, from, the, coastal, areas, of, the, country, and, sought, to, conquer, the, independent, kandyan, kingdom, in, 1802, the, british, became, the, first, foreign, power, to, raise, a, regular, unit, of, sinhalese, with, british, officers, which, was, named, the, 2nd, ceylon, regiment, also, known, as, the, sepoy, corps, it, fought, alongside, british, troops, in, the, kandyan, wars, after, the, matale, rebellion, led, by, puran, appu, in, 1848, in, which, a, number, of, sinhalese, recruits, defected, to, the, side, of, the, rebels, the, recruitment, of, sinhalese, to, the, british, forces, was, temporarily, halted, and, the, ceylon, regiments, disbanded, in, 1861, the, ceylon, light, infantry, volunteers, were, raised, as, a, militia, but, soon, became, a, military, reserve, force, this, became, the, ceylon, defence, force, in, 1910, and, consisted, of, militia, units, these, were, the, colombo, town, guard, and, the, town, guard, artillery, formed, during, the, two, world, wars, with, the, escalation, of, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, local, villagers, under, threat, of, attack, were, formed, into, localized, militia, to, protect, their, families, and, homes, according, to, the, sri, lankan, military, these, militias, were, formed, after, massacres, done, by, the, ltte, and, in, the, early, 1990s, they, were, reformed, as, the, sri, lankan, home, guard, in, 2007, the, home, guard, became, the, sri, lanka, civil, security, force, in, 2008, the, government, called, for, the, formation, of, nearly, 15, 000, civil, defence, committees, at, the, village, level, for, additional, protection, in, 2004, the, liberation, tigers, of, tamil, eelam, claimed, have, establish, a, voluntary, tamil, eelam, auxiliary, force, according, to, the, ltte, s, then, head, of, police, the, force, was, to, be, assigned, to, tasks, such, as, rehabilitation, construction, forest, conservation, and, agriculture, but, would, also, be, used, to, battle, the, sri, lankan, military, if, the, need, arose, in, early, 2009, it, ceased, to, exist, with, the, military, defeat, of, the, ltte, at, the, hands, of, the, sri, lanka, armed, forces, the, janjaweed, militia, consists, of, armed, arab, muslims, fighting, for, the, government, in, khartoum, against, non, arab, muslim, rebels, they, are, active, in, the, darfur, region, of, western, sudan, and, also, in, eastern, chad, according, to, human, rights, watch, these, partisans, are, responsible, for, abuses, including, war, crimes, crimes, against, humanity, and, ethnic, cleansing, as, of, 2012, the, swedish, home, guard, consists, of, 22, 000, organized, into, 40, light, infantry, battalions, of, 300, 700, guardsmen, these, battalions, are, then, organised, into, companies, usually, one, for, every, municipality, the, main, task, of, the, battalions, is, to, guard, vital, military, and, civilian, installations, throughout, the, country, in, 2001, the, rapid, response, units, numbered, around, 5, 000, soldiers, of, the, total, of, 42, 000, as, of, 2014, the, majority, of, the, force, 17, 000, out, of, 22, 000, soldiers, will, be, in, rapid, response, units, the, decrease, in, number, of, troops, comes, with, an, equal, increase, in, quality, and, modern, equipment, these, units, are, motorized, and, are, ready, to, be, mobilized, more, often, than, other, home, guard, units, rapid, response, units, have, more, combat, tasks, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, home, guard, including, escort, duties, some, battalions, located, near, the, coast, also, have, marine, companies, equipped, with, combat, boat, 90, a, few, battalions, have, recently, set, up, specialized, companies, to, evaluate, the, possibility, to, add, new, abilities, to, the, home, guard, these, are, at, the, time, of, writing, eight, reconnaissance, intelligence, companies, four, cbrn, platoons, a, movcon, platoon, an, engineer, platoon, and, a, military, police, unit, one, of, the, best, known, and, ancient, militias, is, the, swiss, armed, forces, switzerland, has, long, maintained, proportionally, the, second, largest, military, force, in, the, world, with, about, half, the, proportional, amount, of, reserve, forces, of, the, israeli, defense, forces, a, militia, of, some, 33, of, the, total, population, the, militia, principle, of, public, duties, is, central, to, swiss, political, culture, and, not, limited, to, military, issues, for, example, in, most, municipalities, it, is, common, to, serve, as, a, conscript, fire, fighter, in, the, compulsory, fire, department, article, 58, 1, of, the, april, 18, 1999, federal, constitution, of, the, swiss, confederation, official, french, version, provides, that, switzerland, has, an, army, it, is, primarily, organised, according, to, the, principle, of, a, militia, however, under, the, country, s, militia, system, professional, soldiers, constitute, about, 5, percent, of, military, personnel, in, 1995, the, number, of, soldiers, was, reduced, to, 400, 000, including, reservists, amounting, to, some, 5, 6, of, the, population, in, 2004, to, 200, 000, including, 80, 000, reservists, or, 2, 5, of, the, population, and, again, in, 2022, to, 150, 000, including, 50, 000, reservists, however, the, swiss, militia, continues, to, consist, of, most, of, the, adult, male, population, with, voluntary, participation, by, women, who, are, usually, issued, an, assault, rifle, which, they, can, keep, at, home, or, store, in, a, central, arsenal, and, most, of, them, have, to, periodically, engage, in, combat, and, marksmanship, training, the, militia, clauses, of, the, swiss, federal, constitution, are, contained, in, art, 59, where, it, is, referred, to, as, military, service, german, milit, rdienst, french, service, militaire, italian, servizio, militare, romansh, servetsch, militar, the, syrian, national, defense, force, was, formed, out, of, pro, government, militias, they, receive, their, salaries, and, their, military, equipment, from, the, government, and, as, of, 2013, numbers, around, 100, 000, the, force, acts, in, an, infantry, role, directly, fighting, against, rebels, on, the, ground, and, running, counter, insurgency, operations, in, coordination, with, the, army, which, provides, them, with, logistical, and, artillery, support, unlike, the, syrian, army, ndf, soldiers, are, allowed, to, take, loot, from, battlefields, which, can, then, be, sold, on, for, extra, money, the, obligation, to, serve, in, the, militia, also, known, as, the, constitutional, force, in, england, derives, from, a, common, law, tradition, and, dates, back, to, anglo, saxon, times, the, tradition, was, that, all, able, bodied, males, were, liable, to, be, called, out, to, serve, in, one, of, two, organisations, these, were, the, posse, comitatus, an, ad, hoc, assembly, called, together, by, a, law, officer, to, apprehend, lawbreakers, and, the, fyrd, a, military, body, intended, to, preserve, internal, order, or, defend, the, locality, against, an, invader, the, latter, developed, into, the, militia, and, was, usually, embodied, by, a, royal, warrant, service, in, each, organisation, involved, different, levels, of, preparedness, with, the, decay, of, the, feudal, system, and, the, military, revolution, of, the, 16th, century, the, militia, began, to, become, an, important, institution, in, english, life, it, was, organised, on, the, basis, of, the, shire, county, and, was, one, of, the, responsibilities, of, the, lord, lieutenant, a, royal, official, usually, a, trusted, nobleman, each, of, the, county, hundreds, was, likewise, the, responsibility, of, a, deputy, lieutenant, who, relayed, orders, to, the, justices, of, the, peace, or, magistrates, every, parish, furnished, a, quota, of, eligible, men, whose, names, were, recorded, on, muster, rolls, likewise, each, household, was, assessed, for, the, purpose, of, finding, weapons, armour, horses, or, their, financial, equivalent, according, to, their, status, the, militia, was, supposed, to, be, mustered, for, training, purposes, from, time, to, time, but, this, was, rarely, done, the, militia, regiments, were, consequently, ill, prepared, for, an, emergency, and, could, not, be, relied, upon, to, serve, outside, their, own, counties, this, state, of, affairs, concerned, many, people, consequently, an, elite, force, was, created, composed, of, members, of, the, militia, who, were, prepared, to, meet, regularly, for, military, training, and, exercise, these, were, formed, into, trained, band, regiments, particularly, in, the, city, of, london, where, the, artillery, ground, was, used, for, training, the, trained, bands, performed, an, important, role, in, the, english, civil, war, on, the, side, of, parliament, in, marching, to, raise, the, siege, of, gloucester, 5, september, 1643, except, for, the, london, trained, bands, both, sides, in, the, civil, war, made, little, use, of, the, militia, preferring, to, recruit, their, armies, by, other, means, as, successful, english, settlement, of, north, america, began, to, take, place, in, 1607, in, the, face, of, the, hostile, intentions, of, the, powerful, spanish, and, of, the, native, populations, it, became, immediately, necessary, to, raise, militia, amongst, the, settlers, the, militia, in, jamestown, saw, constant, action, against, the, powhatan, federation, and, other, native, polities, in, the, virginia, company, s, other, outpost, bermuda, fortification, began, immediately, in, 1612, a, spanish, attack, in, 1614, was, repulsed, by, two, shots, fired, from, the, incomplete, castle, islands, fortifications, manned, by, bermudian, militiamen, in, the, nineteenth, century, fortress, bermuda, would, become, britain, s, gibraltar, of, the, west, heavily, fortified, by, a, regular, army, garrison, to, protect, the, royal, navy, s, headquarters, and, dockyard, in, the, western, atlantic, in, the, 17th, century, however, bermuda, s, defence, was, left, entirely, in, the, hands, of, the, militia, in, addition, to, requiring, all, male, civilians, to, train, and, serve, in, the, militia, of, their, parish, the, bermudian, militia, included, a, standing, body, of, trained, artillerymen, to, garrison, the, numerous, fortifications, which, ringed, new, london, st, george, s, this, standing, body, was, created, by, recruiting, volunteers, and, by, sentencing, criminals, to, serve, as, punishment, the, bermudian, militiamen, were, called, out, on, numerous, occasions, of, war, and, on, one, notable, occasion, to, quell, rioting, privateers, the, 1707, acts, of, union, made, bermudian, and, other, english, militiamen, british, the, militia, in, bermuda, came, to, include, a, troop, of, horse, mounted, infantry, and, served, alongside, volunteers, and, from, 1701, a, small, body, of, regulars, the, militia, faded, away, after, the, american, war, of, 1812, when, the, parliament, of, bermuda, declined, to, renew, the, militia, act, this, resulted, from, the, build, up, of, the, regular, army, bermuda, garrison, along, with, bermuda, s, development, as, the, headquarters, and, dockyard, of, the, north, america, and, west, indies, station, of, the, royal, navy, which, made, the, militia, seem, excess, to, need, vast, sums, of, the, imperial, defence, expenditure, were, lavished, on, fortifying, bermuda, during, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, british, government, cajoled, implored, begged, and, threatened, the, colonial, legislature, for, 80, years, before, it, raised, a, militia, and, volunteer, units, in, 1894, and, 1894, respectively, although, the, militia, had, historically, been, an, infantry, force, many, units, in, britain, had, been, re, tasked, as, militia, artillery, from, the, 1850s, onward, due, to, the, increased, importance, of, the, coastal, artillery, defences, and, the, new, militia, unit, in, bermuda, followed, suit, titled, the, bermuda, militia, artillery, it, was, badged, and, uniformed, as, part, of, the, royal, artillery, and, tasked, with, the, garrison, artillery, role, manning, coastal, batteries, as, in, britain, recruitment, was, of, volunteers, who, engaged, for, terms, of, service, whereas, the, bermuda, volunteer, rifle, corps, was, organised, on, the, same, lines, as, volunteer, rifle, corps, in, britain, recruitment, to, the, bvrc, was, restricted, to, whites, but, the, bma, recruited, primarily, coloured, those, who, were, not, entirely, of, european, heritage, other, ranks, though, its, officers, were, all, white, until, 1953, neither, unit, was, reorganised, in, 1908, when, the, militia, volunteer, force, and, yeomanry, in, britain, merged, into, the, territorial, force, but, the, bvrc, was, re, organised, as, a, territorial, in, 1921, and, the, bma, in, 1926, the, bvrc, name, was, not, modified, to, bermuda, rifles, until, 1951, however, and, the, bermuda, militia, artillery, and, from, 1939, the, bermuda, militia, infantry, continued, to, be, titled, as, militia, until, amalgamated, with, the, bermuda, rifles, in, 1965, to, form, the, bermuda, regiment, in, british, india, a, special, class, of, militia, was, established, in, 1907, this, took, the, form, of, the, frontier, corps, which, consisted, of, locally, recruited, full, time, auxiliaries, under, british, officers, their, role, combined, the, functions, of, tribal, police, and, border, guards, deployed, along, the, north, west, frontier, regional, units, included, the, zhob, militia, the, kurram, militia, and, the, chagai, militia, after, 1946, the, frontier, corps, became, part, of, the, modern, pakistan, army, until, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1688, the, crown, and, parliament, were, in, strong, disagreement, the, english, civil, war, left, a, rather, unusual, military, legacy, both, whigs, and, tories, distrusted, the, creation, of, a, large, standing, army, not, under, civilian, control, the, former, feared, that, it, would, be, used, as, an, instrument, of, royal, tyranny, the, latter, had, memories, of, the, new, model, army, and, the, anti, monarchical, social, and, political, revolution, that, it, brought, about, both, preferred, a, small, standing, army, under, civilian, control, for, defensive, deterrence, and, to, prosecute, foreign, wars, a, large, navy, as, the, first, line, of, national, defence, and, a, militia, composed, of, their, neighbours, as, additional, defence, and, to, preserve, domestic, order, consequently, the, english, bill, of, rights, 1689, declared, amongst, other, things, that, the, raising, or, keeping, a, standing, army, within, the, kingdom, in, time, of, peace, unless, it, be, with, consent, of, parliament, is, against, law, and, that, the, subjects, which, are, protestants, may, have, arms, for, their, defence, suitable, to, their, conditions, and, as, allowed, by, law, this, implies, that, they, are, fitted, to, serve, in, the, militia, which, was, intended, to, serve, as, a, counterweight, to, the, standing, army, and, preserve, civil, liberties, against, the, use, of, the, army, by, a, tyrannical, monarch, or, government, the, crown, still, in, the, british, constitution, controls, the, use, of, the, army, this, ensures, that, officers, and, enlisted, men, swear, an, oath, to, a, politically, neutral, head, of, state, and, not, to, a, politician, while, the, funding, of, the, standing, army, subsists, on, annual, financial, votes, by, parliament, the, mutiny, act, superseded, by, the, army, act, and, now, the, armed, forces, act, is, also, renewed, on, an, annual, basis, by, parliament, if, it, lapses, the, legal, basis, for, enforcing, discipline, disappears, and, soldiers, lose, their, legal, indemnity, for, acts, committed, under, orders, with, the, creation, of, the, british, empire, militias, were, also, raised, in, the, colonies, where, little, support, could, be, provided, by, regular, forces, overseas, militias, were, first, raised, in, jamestown, virginia, and, in, bermuda, where, the, bermuda, militia, followed, over, the, next, two, centuries, a, similar, trajectory, to, that, in, britain, in, 1707, the, acts, of, union, united, the, kingdom, of, england, with, the, kingdom, of, scotland, the, scottish, navy, was, incorporated, into, the, royal, navy, the, scottish, military, as, opposed, to, naval, forces, merged, with, the, english, with, pre, existing, regular, scottish, regiments, maintaining, their, identities, though, command, of, the, new, british, army, was, from, england, how, this, affected, militias, either, side, of, the, border, is, unclear, the, militia, act, 1757, created, a, more, professional, force, better, records, were, kept, and, the, men, were, selected, by, ballot, to, serve, for, longer, periods, specific, provision, was, made, for, members, of, the, religious, society, of, friends, quakers, to, be, exempted, as, conscientious, objectors, from, compulsory, enlistment, in, the, militia, proper, uniforms, and, better, weapons, were, provided, and, the, force, was, embodied, from, time, to, time, for, training, sessions, the, militia, was, widely, embodied, at, various, times, during, the, french, and, napoleonic, wars, it, served, at, several, vulnerable, locations, and, was, particularly, stationed, on, the, south, coast, and, in, ireland, a, number, of, camps, were, held, at, brighton, where, the, militia, regiments, were, reviewed, by, the, prince, regent, this, is, the, origin, of, the, song, brighton, camp, the, militia, could, not, be, compelled, to, serve, overseas, but, it, was, seen, as, a, training, reserve, for, the, army, as, bounties, were, offered, to, men, who, opted, to, exchange, from, the, militia, to, the, regular, army, the, parliament, of, ireland, passed, an, act, in, 1715, raising, regiments, of, militia, in, each, county, and, county, corporate, membership, was, restricted, to, protestants, between, the, ages, of, 16, and, 60, in, 1793, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, irish, militia, were, reorganised, to, form, thirty, seven, county, and, city, regiments, while, officers, of, the, reorganised, force, were, protestant, membership, of, the, other, ranks, was, now, made, available, to, members, of, all, denominations, in, the, late, 17th, century, numerous, individuals, in, the, kingdom, of, scotland, then, in, a, personal, union, with, the, kingdom, of, england, called, for, the, resurrection, of, a, scottish, militia, with, the, understated, aim, of, protecting, the, rights, of, scots, in, great, britain, after, scotland, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, the, militia, act, 1757, did, not, apply, there, the, traditional, scottish, militia, system, continued, with, only, certain, settlements, in, scotland, playing, host, to, a, militia, regiment, this, was, viewed, with, resentment, among, some, in, scotland, and, the, militia, club, was, formed, to, promote, the, raising, of, a, scottish, militia, the, militia, club, along, with, several, other, scottish, gentlemen, s, clubs, became, the, crucible, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, the, militia, act, 1797, empowered, scottish, lord, lieutenants, to, raise, and, command, militia, regiments, in, each, of, the, counties, stewartries, cities, and, places, under, their, jurisdiction, although, muster, rolls, were, prepared, as, late, as, 1820, the, element, of, compulsion, was, abandoned, and, the, militia, transformed, into, a, volunteer, force, revived, by, the, militia, act, 1852, it, was, intended, to, be, seen, as, an, alternative, to, the, regular, army, men, would, volunteer, and, undertake, basic, training, for, several, months, at, an, army, depot, thereafter, they, would, return, to, civilian, life, but, report, for, regular, periods, of, military, training, usually, on, the, weapons, ranges, and, an, annual, two, week, training, camp, in, return, they, would, receive, military, pay, and, a, financial, retainer, a, useful, addition, to, their, civilian, wage, of, course, many, saw, the, annual, camp, as, the, equivalent, of, a, paid, holiday, the, militia, thus, appealed, to, agricultural, labourers, colliers, and, the, like, men, in, casual, occupations, who, could, leave, their, civilian, job, and, pick, it, up, again, until, 1852, the, militia, were, an, entirely, infantry, force, but, from, that, year, a, number, of, county, infantry, regiments, were, converted, to, artillery, and, new, ones, raised, in, 1877, the, militia, of, anglesey, and, monmouthshire, were, converted, to, engineers, under, the, reforms, introduced, by, secretary, of, state, for, war, hugh, childers, in, 1881, the, remaining, militia, infantry, regiments, were, re, designated, as, numbered, battalions, of, regiments, of, the, line, ranking, after, the, two, regular, battalions, typically, an, english, welsh, or, scottish, regiment, would, have, two, militia, battalions, the, 3rd, and, 4th, and, irish, regiments, three, numbered, 3rd, 5th, the, militia, must, not, be, confused, with, the, volunteer, units, created, in, a, wave, of, enthusiasm, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, contrast, with, the, volunteer, force, and, the, similar, yeomanry, cavalry, they, were, considered, rather, plebeian, the, militia, was, transformed, into, the, special, reserve, by, the, military, reforms, of, haldane, in, the, reforming, post, 1906, liberal, government, in, 1908, the, militia, infantry, battalions, were, redesignated, as, reserve, and, a, number, were, amalgamated, or, disbanded, numbered, territorial, force, battalions, ranking, after, the, special, reserve, were, formed, from, the, volunteer, units, at, the, same, time, altogether, 101, infantry, battalions, 33, artillery, regiments, and, two, engineer, regiments, of, special, reservists, were, formed, upon, mobilisation, the, special, reserve, units, would, be, formed, at, the, depot, and, continue, training, while, guarding, vulnerable, points, in, britain, the, special, reserve, units, remained, in, britain, throughout, the, first, world, war, but, their, rank, and, file, did, not, since, the, object, of, the, special, reserve, was, to, supply, drafts, of, replacements, for, the, overseas, units, of, the, regiment, the, original, militiamen, soon, disappeared, and, the, battalions, simply, became, training, units, the, special, reserve, reverted, to, its, militia, designation, in, 1921, then, to, supplementary, reserve, in, 1924, though, the, units, were, effectively, placed, in, suspended, animation, until, disbanded, in, 1953, the, name, was, briefly, revived, in, the, military, training, act, 1939, in, the, aftermath, of, the, munich, crisis, leslie, hore, belisha, secretary, of, state, for, war, wished, to, introduce, a, limited, form, of, conscription, not, known, in, peacetime, britain, since, the, militia, of, the, early, 19th, century, and, previously, it, was, thought, that, calling, the, conscripts, militiamen, would, make, this, more, acceptable, as, it, would, render, them, distinct, from, the, rest, of, the, army, only, single, men, aged, 20, up, to, the, day, before, their, 22nd, birthday, were, to, be, conscripted, for, six, months, full, time, training, before, discharge, into, the, reserve, with, a, free, suit, of, civilian, clothing, although, the, first, intake, was, called, up, in, late, july, 1939, the, declaration, of, war, on, 3, september, entailed, implementation, of, full, time, conscription, for, all, men, aged, 18, 41, superseding, the, militia, never, to, be, revived, three, units, still, maintain, their, militia, designation, in, the, british, army, these, are, the, royal, monmouthshire, royal, engineers, formed, in, 1539, the, jersey, field, squadron, the, royal, militia, island, of, jersey, formed, in, 1337, and, the, royal, alderney, militia, created, in, the, 13th, century, and, reformed, in, 1984, additionally, the, atholl, highlanders, are, a, ceremonial, infantry, militia, maintained, by, the, duke, of, atholl, they, are, the, only, legal, private, army, in, europe, various, other, part, time, home, defence, organisations, have, been, raised, during, times, of, crisis, or, perceived, threat, although, without, the, word, militia, in, their, title, these, have, included, the, various, non, state, paramilitary, groups, involved, in, the, 20th, century, conflicts, in, northern, ireland, and, the, island, of, ireland, such, as, the, various, irish, republican, army, groups, and, loyalist, paramilitaries, could, also, be, described, as, militias, and, are, occasionally, referred, to, as, such, the, ulster, defence, regiment, udr, was, a, locally, raised, professional, militia, instituted, by, an, act, of, parliament, in, december, 1969, becoming, operational, on, 1, april, 1970, created, as, a, non, partisan, force, to, defend, northern, ireland, against, armed, attack, or, sabotage, it, eventually, peaked, at, 11, battalions, with, 7, 559, men, and, women, 197, soldiers, of, the, udr, were, killed, as, active, servicemen, with, a, further, 61, killed, after, leaving, the, regiment, mostly, by, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, as, a, result, of, defence, cuts, it, was, eventually, reduced, to, 7, battalions, before, being, amalgamated, with, the, royal, irish, rangers, in, 1992, to, form, the, home, service, battalions, of, the, royal, irish, regiment, the, history, of, militia, in, the, united, states, dates,

of, manpower, shortages, the, militia, provided, short, term, support, to, the, regulars, in, the, field, throughout, the, war, in, colonial, era, anglo, american, usage, militia, service, was, distinguished, from, military, service, in, that, the, latter, was, normally, a, commitment, for, a, fixed, period, of, time, of, at, least, a, year, for, a, salary, whereas, militia, was, only, to,

argument, presented, in, the, ratification, debates, the, first, legislation, on, the, subject, was, the, militia, act, of, 1792, which, provided, in, part, that, each, and, every, free, able, bodied,

reaching, a, peak, in, the, late, 1860s, even, more, significant, in, terms, of, effect, were, private, militias, paramilitary, organizations, that, formed, starting, in, 1874, including, the, white, league, in, louisiana, which, quickly, formed, chapters, in, other, states, the, red, shirts, in, mississippi, in, 1875, and, with, force, in, south, carolina, and, north, carolina, and, other, white,
