environmentalism, or, environmental, rights, is, a, broad, philosophy, ideology, and, social, movement, about, supporting, life, habitats, and, surroundings, while, environmentalism, focuses, more, on, the, environmental, and, nature, related, aspects, of, green, ideology, and, politics, ecologism, combines, the, ideology, of, social, ecology, and, environmentalism, ecologism, is, more, commonly, used, in, continental, european, languages, while, environmentalism, is, more, commonly, used, in, english, but, the, words, have, slightly, different, connotations, environmentalism, advocates, the, preservation, restoration, and, improvement, of, the, natural, environment, and, critical, earth, system, elements, or, processes, such, as, the, climate, and, may, be, referred, to, as, a, movement, to, control, pollution, or, protect, plant, and, animal, diversity, for, this, reason, concepts, such, as, a, land, ethics, environmental, ethics, biodiversity, ecology, and, the, biophilia, hypothesis, figure, predominantly, the, environmentalist, movement, encompasses, various, approaches, to, addressing, environmental, issues, including, free, market, environmentalism, evangelical, environmentalism, and, the, environmental, conservation, movement, at, its, crux, environmentalism, is, an, attempt, to, balance, relations, between, humans, and, the, various, natural, systems, on, which, they, depend, in, such, a, way, that, all, the, components, are, accorded, a, proper, degree, of, sustainability, the, exact, measures, and, outcomes, of, this, balance, is, controversial, and, there, are, many, different, ways, for, environmental, concerns, to, be, expressed, in, practice, environmentalism, and, environmental, concerns, are, often, represented, by, the, colour, green, but, this, association, has, been, appropriated, by, the, marketing, industries, for, the, tactic, known, as, greenwashing, environmentalism, is, opposed, by, anti, environmentalism, which, says, that, the, earth, is, less, fragile, than, some, environmentalists, maintain, and, portrays, environmentalism, as, overreacting, to, the, human, contribution, to, climate, change, or, opposing, human, advancement, environmentalism, denotes, a, social, movement, that, seeks, to, influence, the, political, process, by, lobbying, activism, and, education, in, order, to, protect, natural, resources, and, ecosystems, an, environmentalist, is, a, person, who, may, speak, out, about, our, natural, environment, and, the, sustainable, management, of, its, resources, through, changes, in, public, policy, or, individual, behaviour, this, may, include, supporting, practices, such, as, informed, consumption, conservation, initiatives, investment, in, renewable, resources, improved, efficiencies, in, the, materials, economy, transitioning, to, new, accounting, paradigms, such, as, ecological, economics, renewing, and, revitalizing, our, connections, with, non, human, life, or, even, opting, to, have, one, less, child, to, reduce, consumption, and, pressure, on, resources, in, various, ways, for, example, grassroots, activism, and, protests, environmentalists, and, environmental, organisations, seek, to, give, the, natural, world, a, stronger, voice, in, human, affairs, in, general, terms, environmentalists, advocate, the, sustainable, management, of, resources, and, the, protection, and, restoration, when, necessary, of, the, natural, environment, through, changes, in, public, policy, and, individual, behaviour, in, its, recognition, of, humanity, as, a, participant, in, ecosystems, the, movement, is, centered, around, ecology, health, and, human, rights, a, concern, for, environmental, protection, has, recurred, in, diverse, forms, in, different, parts, of, the, world, throughout, history, the, earliest, ideas, of, environmental, protectionism, can, be, found, in, jainism, a, religion, from, ancient, india, revived, by, mahavira, in, the, 6th, century, bc, jainism, offers, a, view, that, is, in, many, ways, compatible, with, core, values, associated, with, environmental, activism, such, as, the, protection, of, life, by, nonviolence, which, could, form, a, strong, ecological, ethos, for, global, protection, of, the, environment, mahavira, s, teachings, on, the, symbiosis, between, all, living, beings, as, well, as, the, five, elements, of, earth, water, air, fire, and, space, are, core, to, environmental, thought, today, in, west, asia, the, caliph, abu, bakr, in, the, 630s, ad, commanded, his, army, to, bring, no, harm, to, the, trees, nor, burn, them, with, fire, and, to, slay, not, any, of, the, enemy, s, flock, save, for, your, food, various, islamic, medical, treatises, during, the, 9th, to, 13th, centuries, dealt, with, environmentalism, and, environmental, science, including, the, issue, of, pollution, the, authors, of, such, treatises, included, al, kindi, qusta, ibn, luqa, al, razi, ibn, al, jazzar, al, tamimi, al, masihi, avicenna, ali, ibn, ridwan, ibn, jumay, isaac, israeli, ben, solomon, abd, el, latif, ibn, al, quff, and, ibn, al, nafis, their, works, covered, a, number, of, subjects, related, to, pollution, such, as, air, pollution, water, pollution, soil, contamination, and, the, mishandling, of, municipal, solid, waste, they, also, included, assessments, of, certain, localities, environmental, impact, in, europe, king, edward, i, of, england, banned, the, burning, and, sale, of, sea, coal, in, 1272, by, proclamation, in, london, after, its, smoke, had, become, a, prevalent, annoyance, throughout, the, city, this, fuel, common, in, london, due, to, the, local, scarcity, of, wood, was, given, this, early, name, because, it, could, be, found, washed, up, on, some, shores, from, where, it, was, carted, away, on, a, wheelbarrow, at, the, advent, of, steam, and, electricity, the, muse, of, history, holds, her, nose, and, shuts, her, eyes, h, g, wells, 1918, the, origins, of, the, environmental, movement, lay, in, the, response, to, increasing, levels, of, smoke, pollution, in, the, atmosphere, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, emergence, of, great, factories, and, the, concomitant, immense, growth, in, coal, consumption, gave, rise, to, an, unprecedented, level, of, air, pollution, in, industrial, centers, after, 1900, the, large, volume, of, industrial, chemical, discharges, added, to, the, growing, load, of, untreated, human, waste, the, first, large, scale, modern, environmental, laws, came, in, the, form, of, britain, s, alkali, acts, passed, in, 1863, to, regulate, the, deleterious, air, pollution, gaseous, hydrochloric, acid, given, off, by, the, leblanc, process, used, to, produce, soda, ash, an, alkali, inspector, and, four, sub, inspectors, were, appointed, to, curb, this, pollution, the, inspectorate, s, responsibilities, were, gradually, expanded, culminating, in, the, alkali, order, 1958, which, placed, all, major, heavy, industries, that, emitted, smoke, grit, dust, and, fumes, under, supervision, in, industrial, cities, local, experts, and, reformers, especially, after, 1890, took, the, lead, in, identifying, environmental, degradation, and, pollution, and, initiating, grass, roots, movements, to, demand, and, achieve, reforms, typically, the, highest, priority, went, to, water, and, air, pollution, the, coal, smoke, abatement, society, was, formed, in, 1898, making, it, one, of, the, oldest, environmental, ngos, it, was, founded, by, artist, sir, william, blake, richmond, frustrated, with, the, pall, cast, by, coal, smoke, although, there, were, earlier, pieces, of, legislation, the, public, health, act, 1875, required, all, furnaces, and, fireplaces, to, consume, their, own, smoke, it, also, provided, for, sanctions, against, factories, that, emitted, large, amounts, of, black, smoke, this, law, s, provisions, were, extended, in, 1926, with, the, smoke, abatement, act, to, include, other, emissions, such, as, soot, ash, and, gritty, particles, and, to, empower, local, authorities, to, impose, their, own, regulations, it, was, only, under, the, impetus, of, the, great, smog, of, 1952, in, london, which, almost, brought, the, city, to, a, standstill, and, may, have, caused, upward, of, 6, 000, deaths, that, the, clean, air, act, 1956, was, passed, and, airborne, pollution, in, the, city, was, first, tackled, financial, incentives, were, offered, to, householders, to, replace, open, coal, fires, with, alternatives, such, as, installing, gas, fires, or, those, who, preferred, to, burn, coke, instead, a, byproduct, of, town, gas, production, which, produces, minimal, smoke, smoke, control, areas, were, introduced, in, some, towns, and, cities, where, only, smokeless, fuels, could, be, burnt, and, power, stations, were, relocated, away, from, cities, the, act, formed, an, important, impetus, to, modern, environmentalism, and, caused, a, rethinking, of, the, dangers, of, environmental, degradation, to, people, s, quality, of, life, the, late, 19th, century, also, saw, the, passage, of, the, first, wildlife, conservation, laws, the, zoologist, alfred, newton, published, a, series, of, investigations, into, the, desirability, of, establishing, a, close, time, for, the, preservation, of, indigenous, animals, between, 1872, and, 1903, his, advocacy, for, legislation, to, protect, animals, from, hunting, during, the, mating, season, led, to, the, formation, of, the, royal, society, for, the, protection, of, birds, and, influenced, the, passage, of, the, sea, birds, preservation, act, in, 1869, as, the, first, nature, protection, law, in, the, world, during, the, spanish, revolution, anarchist, controlled, territories, undertook, several, environmental, reforms, which, were, possibly, the, largest, in, the, world, at, the, time, daniel, guerin, notes, that, anarchist, territories, would, diversify, crops, extend, irrigation, initiate, reforestation, start, tree, nurseries, and, help, to, establish, naturist, communities, once, there, was, a, link, discovered, between, air, pollution, and, tuberculosis, the, cnt, shut, down, several, metal, factories, early, interest, in, the, environment, was, a, feature, of, the, romantic, movement, in, the, early, 19th, century, one, of, the, earliest, modern, pronouncements, on, thinking, about, human, industrial, advancement, and, its, influence, on, the, environment, was, written, by, japanese, geographer, educator, philosopher, and, author, tsunesaburo, makiguchi, in, his, 1903, publication, jinsei, chirigaku, a, geography, of, human, life, in, britain, the, poet, william, wordsworth, travelled, extensively, in, the, lake, district, and, wrote, that, it, is, a, sort, of, national, property, in, which, every, man, has, a, right, and, interest, who, has, an, eye, to, perceive, and, a, heart, to, enjoy, systematic, efforts, on, behalf, of, the, environment, only, began, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, grew, out, of, the, amenity, movement, in, britain, in, the, 1870s, which, was, a, reaction, to, industrialisation, the, growth, of, cities, and, worsening, air, and, water, pollution, starting, with, the, formation, of, the, commons, preservation, society, in, 1865, the, movement, championed, rural, preservation, against, the, encroachments, of, industrialisation, robert, hunter, solicitor, for, the, society, worked, with, hardwicke, rawnsley, octavia, hill, and, john, ruskin, to, lead, a, successful, campaign, to, prevent, the, construction, of, railways, to, carry, slate, from, the, quarries, which, would, have, ruined, the, unspoiled, valleys, of, newlands, and, ennerdale, this, success, led, to, the, formation, of, the, lake, district, defence, society, later, to, become, the, friends, of, the, lake, district, peter, kropotkin, wrote, about, ecology, in, economics, agricultural, science, conservation, ethology, criminology, urban, planning, geography, geology, and, biology, he, observed, in, swiss, and, siberian, glaciers, that, they, had, been, slowly, melting, since, the, dawn, of, the, industrial, revolution, possibly, making, him, one, of, the, first, predictors, for, climate, change, he, also, observed, the, damage, done, from, deforestation, and, hunting, kropotkin, s, writings, would, become, influential, in, the, 1970s, and, became, a, major, inspiration, for, the, intentional, community, movement, as, well, as, his, ideas, becoming, the, basis, for, the, theory, of, social, ecology, in, 1893, hill, hunter, and, rawnsley, agreed, to, set, up, a, national, body, to, coordinate, environmental, conservation, efforts, across, the, country, the, national, trust, for, places, of, historic, interest, or, natural, beauty, was, formally, inaugurated, in, 1894, the, organisation, obtained, secure, footing, through, the, 1907, national, trust, bill, which, gave, the, trust, the, status, of, a, statutory, corporation, and, the, bill, was, passed, in, august, 1907, an, early, back, to, nature, movement, which, anticipated, the, romantic, ideal, of, modern, environmentalism, was, advocated, by, intellectuals, such, as, john, ruskin, william, morris, george, bernard, shaw, and, edward, carpenter, who, were, all, against, consumerism, pollution, and, other, activities, that, were, harmful, to, the, natural, world, the, movement, was, a, reaction, to, the, urban, conditions, of, the, industrial, towns, where, sanitation, was, awful, pollution, levels, intolerable, and, housing, terribly, cramped, idealists, championed, the, rural, life, as, a, mythical, utopia, and, advocated, a, return, to, it, john, ruskin, argued, that, people, should, return, to, a, small, piece, of, english, ground, beautiful, peaceful, and, fruitful, we, will, have, no, steam, engines, upon, it, we, will, have, plenty, of, flowers, and, vegetables, we, will, have, some, music, and, poetry, the, children, will, learn, to, dance, to, it, and, sing, it, practical, ventures, in, the, establishment, of, small, cooperative, farms, were, even, attempted, and, old, rural, traditions, without, the, taint, of, manufacture, or, the, canker, of, artificiality, were, enthusiastically, revived, including, the, morris, dance, and, the, maypole, these, ideas, also, inspired, various, environmental, groups, in, the, uk, such, as, the, royal, society, for, the, protection, of, birds, established, in, 1889, by, emily, williamson, as, a, protest, group, to, campaign, for, greater, protection, for, the, indigenous, birds, of, the, island, the, society, attracted, growing, support, from, the, suburban, middle, classes, as, well, as, support, from, many, other, influential, figures, such, as, the, ornithologist, professor, alfred, newton, by, 1900, public, support, for, the, organisation, had, grown, and, it, had, over, 25, 000, members, the, garden, city, movement, incorporated, many, environmental, concerns, into, its, urban, planning, manifesto, the, socialist, league, and, the, clarion, movement, also, began, to, advocate, measures, of, nature, conservation, the, movement, in, the, united, states, began, in, the, late, 19th, century, out, of, concerns, for, protecting, the, natural, resources, of, the, west, with, individuals, such, as, john, muir, and, henry, david, thoreau, making, key, philosophical, contributions, thoreau, was, interested, in, peoples, relationship, with, nature, and, studied, this, by, living, close, to, nature, in, a, simple, life, he, published, his, experiences, in, the, book, walden, which, argues, that, people, should, become, intimately, close, with, nature, muir, came, to, believe, in, nature, s, inherent, right, especially, after, spending, time, hiking, in, yosemite, valley, and, studying, both, the, ecology, and, geology, he, successfully, lobbied, congress, to, form, yosemite, national, park, and, went, on, to, set, up, the, sierra, club, in, 1892, the, conservationist, principles, as, well, as, the, belief, in, an, inherent, right, of, nature, were, to, become, the, bedrock, of, modern, environmentalism, in, the, 20th, century, environmental, ideas, continued, to, grow, in, popularity, and, recognition, efforts, were, starting, to, be, made, to, save, some, wildlife, particularly, the, american, bison, the, death, of, the, last, passenger, pigeon, as, well, as, the, endangerment, of, the, american, bison, helped, to, focus, the, minds, of, conservationists, and, to, popularise, their, concerns, in, 1916, the, national, park, service, was, founded, by, us, president, woodrow, wilson, the, forestry, commission, was, set, up, in, 1919, in, britain, to, increase, the, amount, of, woodland, in, britain, by, buying, land, for, afforestation, and, reforestation, the, commission, was, also, tasked, with, promoting, forestry, and, the, production, of, timber, for, trade, during, the, 1920s, the, commission, focused, on, acquiring, land, to, begin, planting, out, new, forests, much, of, the, land, was, previously, used, for, agricultural, purposes, by, 1939, the, forestry, commission, was, the, largest, landowner, in, britain, during, the, 1930s, the, nazis, had, elements, that, were, supportive, of, animal, rights, zoos, and, wildlife, and, took, several, measures, to, ensure, their, protection, in, 1933, the, government, created, a, stringent, animal, protection, law, and, in, 1934, das, reichsjagdgesetz, the, reich, hunting, law, was, enacted, which, limited, hunting, several, nazis, were, environmentalists, notably, rudolf, hess, and, species, protection, and, animal, welfare, were, significant, issues, in, the, regime, in, 1935, the, regime, enacted, the, reich, nature, protection, act, reichsnaturschutzgesetz, the, concept, of, the, dauerwald, best, translated, as, the, perpetual, forest, which, included, concepts, such, as, forest, management, and, protection, was, promoted, and, efforts, were, also, made, to, curb, air, pollution, in, 1949, a, sand, county, almanac, by, aldo, leopold, was, published, it, explained, leopold, s, belief, that, humankind, should, have, moral, respect, for, the, environment, and, that, it, is, unethical, to, harm, it, the, book, is, sometimes, called, the, most, influential, book, on, conservation, throughout, the, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and, beyond, photography, was, used, to, enhance, public, awareness, of, the, need, for, protecting, land, and, recruiting, members, to, environmental, organisations, david, brower, ansel, adams, and, nancy, newhall, created, the, sierra, club, exhibit, format, series, which, helped, raise, public, environmental, awareness, and, brought, a, rapidly, increasing, flood, of, new, members, to, the, sierra, club, and, to, the, environmental, movement, in, general, this, is, dinosaur, edited, by, wallace, stegner, with, photographs, by, martin, litton, and, philip, hyde, prevented, the, building, of, dams, within, dinosaur, national, monument, by, becoming, part, of, a, new, kind, of, activism, called, environmentalism, that, combined, the, conservationist, ideals, of, thoreau, leopold, and, muir, with, hard, hitting, advertising, lobbying, book, distribution, letter, writing, campaigns, and, more, the, powerful, use, of, photography, in, addition, to, the, written, word, for, conservation, dated, back, to, the, creation, of, yosemite, national, park, when, photographs, persuaded, abraham, lincoln, to, preserve, the, beautiful, glacier, carved, landscape, for, all, time, the, sierra, club, exhibit, format, series, galvanised, public, opposition, to, building, dams, in, the, grand, canyon, and, protected, many, other, national, treasures, the, sierra, club, often, led, a, coalition, of, many, environmental, groups, including, the, wilderness, society, and, many, others, after, a, focus, on, preserving, wilderness, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, sierra, club, and, other, groups, broadened, their, focus, to, include, such, issues, as, air, and, water, pollution, population, concern, and, curbing, the, exploitation, of, natural, resources, the, prevailing, belief, regarding, the, origins, of, early, environmentalism, suggests, that, it, emerged, as, a, local, response, to, the, adverse, impacts, of, industrialization, in, western, nations, and, communities, in, terms, of, conservation, efforts, there, is, a, widespread, view, that, the, conservation, movement, began, as, a, predominantly, elite, concern, in, north, america, focusing, on, the, preservation, of, local, natural, areas, a, less, prevailing, view, however, attributes, the, roots, of, early, environmentalism, to, a, growing, public, concern, about, the, influence, of, western, economic, forces, particularly, in, connection, with, colonization, on, tropical, environments, richard, grove, in, a, 1990, report, points, out, that, little, attention, has, been, given, to, the, significance, of, the, colonial, experience, particularly, the, european, colonial, experience, in, shaping, early, european, environmentalism, grove, argues, that, as, european, colonization, expanded, so, did, the, european, interaction, with, land, and, indigenous, people, providing, europeans, with, an, awareness, of, the, destructive, consequences, of, their, economic, and, colonial, activities, on, the, newly, discovered, lands, as, global, trade, expanded, through, colonization, the, european, concept, of, nature, underwent, a, transformation, with, the, foreign, tropical, environments, of, their, conquests, evolving, into, romantic, symbols, of, idyllic, landscapes, that, required, care, and, protection, by, europeans, examples, of, this, impact, of, colonization, on, the, western, mindset, can, be, found, in, prominent, cultural, references, such, as, william, shakespeare, s, play, the, tempest, and, andrew, marvell, s, poem, bermoothes, although, this, newfound, self, awareness, among, europeans, about, the, destructive, impacts, of, colonization, on, the, environment, did, not, halt, the, expansion, of, colonization, itself, it, did, pave, the, way, for, a, different, approach, to, colonization, one, focused, on, the, preservation, and, protection, of, foreign, natural, resources, this, phenomenon, can, be, linked, to, the, emergence, of, edenic, thinking, or, the, quest, for, eden, on, earth, this, quest, to, locate, eden, gained, prominence, in, the, 15th, century, coinciding, with, colonization, and, fostered, the, belief, that, newly, discovered, lands, especially, tropical, ones, had, the, potential, to, be, heavenly, paradises, in, 1962, silent, spring, by, american, biologist, rachel, carson, was, published, the, book, cataloged, the, environmental, impacts, of, the, indiscriminate, spraying, of, ddt, in, the, us, and, questioned, the, logic, of, releasing, large, amounts, of, chemicals, into, the, environment, without, fully, understanding, their, effects, on, human, health, and, ecology, the, book, suggested, that, ddt, and, other, pesticides, may, cause, cancer, and, that, their, agricultural, use, was, a, threat, to, wildlife, particularly, birds, the, resulting, public, concern, led, to, the, creation, of, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, in, 1970, which, subsequently, banned, the, agricultural, use, of, ddt, in, the, us, in, 1972, the, limited, use, of, ddt, in, disease, vector, control, continues, to, this, day, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, and, remains, controversial, the, book, s, legacy, was, to, produce, a, far, greater, awareness, of, environmental, issues, and, interest, into, how, people, affect, the, environment, with, this, new, interest, in, environment, came, interest, in, problems, such, as, air, pollution, and, petroleum, spills, and, environmental, interest, grew, new, pressure, groups, formed, notably, greenpeace, and, friends, of, the, earth, us, as, well, as, notable, local, organisations, such, as, the, wyoming, outdoor, council, which, was, founded, in, 1967, from, 1962, to, 1998, the, environmental, movement, founded, 772, national, organizations, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1970s, the, environmental, movement, gained, rapid, speed, around, the, world, as, a, productive, outgrowth, of, the, counterculture, movement, the, world, s, first, political, parties, to, campaign, on, a, predominantly, environmental, platform, were, the, united, tasmania, group, of, tasmania, australia, and, the, values, party, of, new, zealand, the, first, green, party, in, europe, was, the, popular, movement, for, the, environment, founded, in, 1972, in, the, swiss, canton, of, neuch, tel, the, first, national, green, party, in, europe, was, people, founded, in, britain, in, february, 1973, which, eventually, turned, into, the, ecology, party, and, then, the, green, party, protection, of, the, environment, also, became, important, in, the, developing, world, the, chipko, movement, was, formed, in, india, under, the, influence, of, mhatmas, gandhi, and, they, set, up, peaceful, resistance, to, deforestation, by, literally, hugging, trees, leading, to, the, term, tree, huggers, their, peaceful, methods, of, protest, and, slogan, ecology, is, permanent, economy, were, very, influential, another, milestone, in, the, movement, was, the, creation, of, earth, day, earth, day, was, first, observed, in, san, francisco, and, other, cities, on, 21, march, 1970, the, first, day, of, spring, it, was, created, to, give, awareness, to, environmental, issues, on, 21, march, 1971, united, nations, secretary, general, u, thant, spoke, of, a, spaceship, earth, on, earth, day, hereby, referring, to, the, ecosystem, services, the, earth, supplies, to, us, and, hence, our, obligation, to, protect, it, and, with, it, ourselves, earth, day, is, now, coordinated, globally, by, the, earth, day, network, and, is, celebrated, in, more, than, 192, countries, every, year, the, un, s, first, major, conference, on, international, environmental, issues, the, united, nations, conference, on, the, human, environment, also, known, as, the, stockholm, conference, was, held, on, 5, 16, june, 1972, it, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, development, of, international, environmental, politics, by, the, mid, 1970s, many, felt, that, people, were, on, the, edge, of, environmental, catastrophe, the, back, to, the, land, movement, started, to, form, and, ideas, of, environmental, ethics, joined, with, anti, vietnam, war, sentiments, and, other, political, issues, these, individuals, lived, outside, normal, society, and, started, to, take, on, some, of, the, more, radical, environmental, theories, such, as, deep, ecology, around, this, time, more, mainstream, environmentalism, was, starting, to, show, force, with, the, signing, of, the, endangered,

lovelock, a, british, scientist, published, gaia, a, new, look, at, life, on, earth, which, put, forth, the, gaia, hypothesis, it, proposes, that, life, on, earth, can, be, understood, as, a, single, organism, this, became, an, important, part, of, the, deep, green, ideology, throughout, the, rest, of, the, history, of, environmentalism, there, has, been, debate, and, argument, between, more, radical, followers, of, this, deep, green, ideology, and, more, mainstream, environmentalists, environmentalism, continues, to, evolve, to, face, up, to, new, issues, such, as, global, warming, overpopulation, genetic, engineering, and, plastic, pollution, research, demonstrates, a, precipitous, decline, in, the, us, public, s, interest, in, 19, different, areas, of, environmental, concern, americans, are, less, likely, to, be, actively, participating, in, an, environmental, movement, or, organisation, and, more, likely, to, identify, as, unsympathetic, to, an, environmental, movement, than, in, 2000, this, is, likely, a, lingering, factor, of, the, great, recession, in, 2008, since, 2005, the, percentage, of, americans, agreeing, that, the, environment, should, be, given, priority, over, economic, growth, has, dropped, 10, points, in, contrast, those, feeling, that, growth, should, be, given, priority, even, if, the, environment, suffers, to, some, extent, has, risen, 12, percent, nevertheless, a, recent, national, geographic, survey, indicated, strong, desire, for, commitment, across, a, dozen, countries, indicating, a, majority, were, in, favour, of, more, than,

cooperatives, and, built, schools, and, hospitals, to, help, the, local, populations, they, have, also, created, a, network, of, autonomous, community, radio, stations, to, educate, people, about, dangers, to, the, environment, and, inform, the, surrounding, communities, about, new, industrial, projects, that, would, destroy, more, land, in, 2001, the, cipo, rfm, defeated, the, construction, of, a, highway, that, was, part, of, plan, puebla, panama, the, environmental, movement, a, term, that, sometimes, includes, the, conservation, and, green, movements, is, a, diverse, scientific, social, and, political, movement, though, the, movement, is, represented, by, a, range, of, organisations, because, of, the, inclusion, of, environmentalism, in, the, classroom, curriculum, the, environmental, movement, has, a, younger, demographic, than, is, common, in, other, social, movements, see, green, seniors, environmentalism, as, a, movement, covers, broad, areas, of, institutional, oppression, including, for, example, consumption, of, ecosystems, and, natural, resources, into, waste, dumping, waste, into, disadvantaged, communities, air, pollution, water, pollution, weak, infrastructure, exposure, of, organic, life, to, toxins, mono, culture, anti, polythene, drive, jhola, movement, and, various, other, focuses, because, of, these, divisions, the, environmental, movement, can, be, categorized, into, these, primary, focuses, environmental, science, environmental, activism, environmental, advocacy, and, environmental, justice, free, market, environmentalism, is, a, theory, that, argues, that, the, free, market, property, rights, and, tort, law, provide, the, best, tools, to, preserve, the, health, and, sustainability, of, the, environment, it, considers, environmental, stewardship, to, be, natural, as, well, as, the, expulsion, of, polluters, and, other, aggressors, through, individual, and, class, action, evangelical, environmentalism, is, an, environmental, movement, in, the, united, states, in, which, some, evangelicals, have, emphasized, biblical, mandates, concerning, humanity, s, role, as, steward, and, subsequent, responsibility, for, the, care, taking, of, creation, while, the, movement, has, focused, on, different, environmental, issues, it, is, best, known, for, its, focus, of, addressing, climate, action, from, a, biblically, grounded, theological, perspective, this, movement, is, controversial, among, some, non, christian, environmentalists, due, to, its, rooting, in, a, specific, religion, environmental, preservation, in, the, united, states, and, other, parts, of, the, world, including, australia, is, viewed, as, the, setting, aside, of, natural, resources, to, prevent, damage, caused, by, contact, with, humans, or, by, certain, human, activities, such, as, logging, mining, hunting, and, fishing, often, to, replace, them, with, new, human, activities, such, as, tourism, and, recreation, regulations, and, laws, may, be, enacted, for, the, preservation, of, natural, resources, thermodynamic, derived, environmentalism, is, based, on, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, minimization, of, exergy, disruption, or, entropy, generation, and, the, concept, of, availability, it, moves, from, he, milestone, work, of, jan, szargut, who, emphasized, the, relation, between, exergy, and, availability, it, is, necessary, to, remember, exergy, ecology, and, democracy, by, goran, wall, a, short, essay, which, evidences, the, strict, relation, that, relates, exergy, disruption, with, environmental, and, social, disruption, more, recently, it, has, verified, that, governmental, emissions, and, impacts, balances, underestimate, the, effective, ghg, production, by, means, of, human, processes, in, fact, they, often, neglects, the, impacts, of, import, export, related, emissions, in, addition, they, have, analyzed, the, un, sdgs, and, the, methods, which, are, suggested, for, verifying, the, advances, of, the, countries, this, activity, has, evidenced, that, objective, and, coherent, parameters, are, missing, therefore, they, suggest, the, introduction, of, exergy, analysis, as, the, most, effective, method, for, estimating, the, environmental, degradation, therefore, a, novel, fiscal, model, based, on, exergy, and, availability, disruption, has, been, defined, as, the, only, possible, way, for, overcoming, the, problems, induced, by, the, globalized, markets, environmental, organisations, can, be, global, regional, national, or, local, they, can, be, government, run, or, private, ngo, environmentalist, activity, exists, in, almost, every, country, moreover, groups, dedicated, to, community, development, and, social, justice, also, focus, on, environmental, concerns, some, us, environmental, organisations, among, them, the, natural, resources, defense, council, and, the, environmental, defense, fund, specialise, in, bringing, lawsuits, a, tactic, seen, as, particularly, useful, in, that, country, other, groups, such, as, the, us, based, national, wildlife, federation, earth, day, national, cleanup, day, the, nature, conservancy, and, the, wilderness, society, and, global, groups, like, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, and, friends, of, the, earth, disseminate, information, participate, in, public, hearings, lobby, stage, demonstrations, and, may, purchase, land, for, preservation, statewide, nonprofit, organisations, such, as, the, wyoming, outdoor, council, often, collaborate, with, these, national, organisations, and, employ, similar, strategies, smaller, groups, including, wildlife, conservation, international, conduct, research, on, endangered, species, and, ecosystems, more, radical, organisations, such, as, greenpeace, earth, first, and, the, earth, liberation, front, have, more, directly, opposed, actions, they, regard, as, environmentally, harmful, while, greenpeace, is, devoted, to, nonviolent, confrontation, as, a, means, of, bearing, witness, to, environmental, wrongs, and, bringing, issues, into, the, public, realm, for, debate, the, underground, earth, liberation, front, engages, in, the, clandestine, destruction, of, property, the, release, of, caged, or, penned, animals, and, other, criminal, acts, such, tactics, are, regarded, as, unusual, within, the, movement, however, on, an, international, level, concern, for, the, environment, was, the, subject, of, a, united, nations, conference, on, the, human, environment, in, stockholm, in, 1972, attended, by, 114, nations, out, of, this, meeting, developed, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, and, the, follow, up, united, nations, conference, on, environment, and, development, in, 1992, other, international, organisations, in, support, of, environmental, policies, development, include, the, commission, for, environmental, cooperation, as, part, of, nafta, the, european, environment, agency, eea, and, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, notable, environmental, protests, and, campaigns, include, notable, advocates, for, environmental, protection, and, sustainability, include, every, year, more, than, 100, environmental, activists, are, murdered, throughout, the, world, most, recent, deaths, are, in, brazil, where, activists, combat, logging, in, the, amazon, rainforest, 116, environmental, activists, were, assassinated, in, 2014, and, 185, in, 2015, this, represents, more, than, two, environmentalists, assassinated, every, week, in, 2014, and, three, every, week, in, 2015, more, than, 200, environmental, activists, were, assassinated, worldwide, between, 2016, and, early, 2018, a, 2020, incident, saw, several, rangers, murdered, in, the, congo, rainforest, by, poaching, squads, occurrences, like, this, are, relatively, common, and, account, for, a, large, number, of, deaths, when, environmentalism, first, became, popular, during, the, early, 20th, century, the, focus, was, wilderness, protection, and, wildlife, preservation, these, goals, reflected, the, interests, of, the, movement, s, initial, primarily, white, middle, and, upper, class, supporters, including, through, viewing, preservation, and, protection, via, a, lens, that, failed, to, appreciate, the, centuries, long, work, of, indigenous, communities, who, had, lived, without, ushering, in, the, types, of, environmental, devastation, these, settler, colonial, environmentalists, now, sought, to, mitigate, the, actions, of, many, mainstream, environmental, organizations, still, reflect, these, early, principles, numerous, low, income, minorities, felt, isolated, or, negatively, impacted, by, the, movement, exemplified, by, the, southwest, organizing, project, s, swop, letter, to, the, group, of, 10, a, letter, sent, to, major, environmental, organizations, by, several, local, environmental, justice, activists, the, letter, argued, that, the, environmental, movement, was, so, concerned, about, cleaning, up, and, preserving, nature, that, it, ignored, the, negative, side, effects, that, doing, so, caused, communities, nearby, namely, less, job, growth, in, addition, the, nimby, movement, has, transferred, locally, unwanted, land, uses, lulus, from, middle, class, neighborhoods, to, poor, communities, with, large, minority, populations, therefore, vulnerable, communities, with, fewer, political, opportunities, are, more, often, exposed, to, hazardous, waste, and, toxins, this, has, resulted, in, the, pibby, principle, or, at, least, the, pimby, place, in, minorities, backyard, as, supported, by, the, united, church, of, christ, s, study, in, 1987, as, a, result, some, minorities, have, viewed, the, environmental, movement, as, elitist, environmental, elitism, manifested, itself, in, three, different, forms, many, environmentalists, believe, that, human, interference, with, nature, should, be, restricted, or, minimised, as, a, matter, of, urgency, for, the, sake, of, life, or, the, planet, or, just, for, the, benefit, of, the, human, species, whereas, environmental, skeptics, and, anti, environmentalists, do, not, believe, that, there, is, such, a, need, one, can, also, regard, oneself, as, an, environmentalist, and, believe, that, human, interference, with, nature, should, be, increased, nevertheless, there, is, a, risk, that, the, shift, from, emotional, environmentalism, into, the, technical, management, of, natural, resources, and, hazards, could, decrease, the, touch, of, humans, with, nature, leading, to, less, concern, with, environment, preservation, increasingly, typical, conservation, rhetoric, is, being, replaced, with, restoration, approaches, and, larger, landscape, initiatives, that, seek, to, create, more, holistic, impacts, in, the, 2000s, american, author, film, director, medical, graduate, and, intellect, michael, crichton, criticized, environmentalism, as, being, religiously, motivated, rather, than, grounded, in, empirical, evidence, arguing, that, climate, change, was, a, natural, part, of, earth, s, history, and, had, been, occurring, long, before, humans, dominated, the, planet, also, claiming, to, argue, from, his, minor, education, in, anthropology, he, stated, that, religion, was, a, part, of, human, social, make, up, and, that, if, it, was, suppressed, it, would, simply, re, emerge, in, another, form, with, the, decline, of, christianity, and, church, attendance, in, the, western, world, environmentalism, has, become, more, popular, according, to, him, which, he, termed, as, the, religion, of, urban, atheists, others, seek, a, balance, that, involves, both, caring, deeply, for, the, environment, while, letting, science, guide, human, actions, affecting, it, such, an, approach, would, avoid, the, emotionalism, which, for, example, anti, gmo, activism, has, been, criticized, for, and, protect, the, integrity, of, science, planting, trees, for, another, example, can, be, emotionally, satisfying, but, should, also, involve, being, conscious, of, ecological, concerns, such, as, the, effect, on, water, cycles, and, the, use, of, nonnative, potentially, invasive, species
