typing, as, opposed, to, handwriting, has, been, a, source, of, confusion, for, many, especially, because, whereas, in, arabic, and, persian, there, exists, one, single, letter, for, h, in, urdu, the, letter, has, diverged, into, two, distinct, variants, gol, he, round, he, and, do, ca, mi, he, two, eyed, he, the, former, is, written, is, written, round, and, zigzagged, as, and, can, impart, the,

t, apply, to, all, aspirated, consoants, some, are, still, written, as, digraphs, the, letter, h, is, also, used, in, sindhi, to, represent, the, sound, in, native, sindhi, words, in, arabic, and, persian, loanwords, and, to, represent, vowels, or, at, the, end, of, the, word, the, notations, and, conventions, in, sindhi, are, different, from, either, persian, or, arabic, and, from, urdu, given, the, variety, of, the, types, of, h, across, these, languages, for, which, unicode, characters, have, been, designed, in, order, for, the, letters, to, be, displayed, correctly, when, typing, a, correct, and, consistent, convention, needs, to, be, followed, the, following, table, will, present, these, in, detail, the, punctuation, of, sindhi, perso, arabic, script, differs, slightly, from, that, of, urdu, persian, and, arabic, namely, instead, of, using, the, typical, inverted, comma, common, in, these, mentioned, alphabet, a, reversed, comma, is, used, although, many, documents, do, indeed, incorrectly, use, urdu, punctuations, in, india, the, devanagari, script, is, also, used, to, write, sindhi, a, modern, version, was, introduced, by, the, government, of, india, in, 1948, however, it, did, not, gain, full, acceptance, so, both, the, sindhi, arabic, and, devanagari, scripts, are, used, in, india, a, person, may, write, a, sindhi, language, paper, for, a, civil, services, examination, in, either, script, devanagari, was, seen, as, the, most, practical, option, for, sindhi, language, in, india, diacritical, bars, below, the, letter, are, used, to, mark,

historically, to, write, sindhi, the, khudabadi, alphabet, was, invented, in, 1550, ce, and, was, used, alongside, other, scripts, by, the, hindu, community, until, the, colonial, era, where, the, sole, usage, of, the, arabic, script, for, official, purposes, was, legislated, the, script, continued, to, be, used, on, a, smaller, scale, by, the, trader, community, until, the, partition, of, india, in, 1947, khojki, was, employed, primarily, to, record, muslim, shia, ismaili, religious, literature, as, well, as, literature, for, a, few, secret, shia, muslim, sects, the, gurmukhi, script, was, also, used, to, write, sindhi, mainly, in, india, by, hindus, the, sindhi, roman, script, or, roman, sindhi, script, is, the, contemporary, sindhi, script, usually, used, by, the, sindhis, when,

provincial, language, in, pakistan, to, have, its, own, official, status, by, 2001, abdul, majid, bhurgri, had, coordinated, with, microsoft, to, develop, unicode, based, software, in, the, form, of, the, perso, arabic, sindhi, script, which, afterwards, became, the, basis, for, the, communicated, use, by, sindhi, speakers, around, the, world, in, 2016, google, introduced, the, first, automated, translator, for, sindhi, language, later, on, in, 2023, an, offline, support, was, introduced, by, google, translate, which, was, followed, by, microsoft, translator, strengthening, support, in, may, of, same, year, in, june, 2014, the, khudabadi, script, of, the, sindhi, language, was, added, to, unicode, however, as, of, now, the, script, currently, has, no, proper, rendering, support, to, view, it, in, unsupported, devices
