korean, south, korean, hangugeo, north, korean, chos, n, is, the, native, language, for, about, 81, million, people, mostly, of, korean, descent, it, is, the, national, language, of, both, north, korea, and, south, korea, beyond, korea, the, language, is, recognized, as, a, minority, language, in, parts, of, china, namely, jilin, and, specifically, yanbian, prefecture, and, changbai, county, it, is, also, spoken, by, sakhalin, koreans, in, parts, of, sakhalin, the, russian, island, just, north, of, japan, and, by, the, koryo, saram, in, parts, of, central, asia, the, language, has, a, few, extinct, relatives, which, along, with, the, jeju, language, jejuan, of, jeju, island, and, korean, itself, form, the, compact, koreanic, language, family, even, so, jejuan, and, korean, are, not, mutually, intelligible, the, linguistic, homeland, of, korean, is, suggested, to, be, somewhere, in, contemporary, manchuria, the, hierarchy, of, the, society, from, which, the, language, originates, deeply, influences, the, language, leading, to, a, system, of, speech, levels, and, honorifics, indicative, of, the, formality, of, any, given, situation, modern, korean, is, written, in, the, korean, script, hangul, in, south, korea, chos, n, g, l, in, north, korea, a, system, developed, during, the, 15th, century, for, that, purpose, although, it, did, not, become, the, primary, script, until, the, 20th, century, the, script, uses, 24, basic, letters, jamo, and, 27, complex, letters, formed, from, the, basic, ones, when, first, recorded, in, historical, texts, korean, was, only, a, spoken, language, since, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, aspects, of, korean, culture, have, spread, to, other, countries, through, globalization, and, cultural, exports, as, such, interest, in, korean, language, acquisition, as, a, foreign, language, is, also, generated, by, longstanding, alliances, military, involvement, and, diplomacy, such, as, between, south, korea, united, states, and, china, north, korea, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, the, korean, war, along, with, other, languages, such, as, chinese, and, arabic, korean, is, ranked, at, the, top, difficulty, level, for, english, speakers, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, modern, korean, descends, from, middle, korean, which, in, turn, descends, from, old, korean, which, descends, from, the, proto, koreanic, language, which, is, generally, suggested, to, have, its, linguistic, homeland, somewhere, in, manchuria, whitman, 2012, suggests, that, the, proto, koreans, already, present, in, northern, korea, expanded, into, the, southern, part, of, the, korean, peninsula, at, around, 300, bc, and, coexisted, with, the, descendants, of, the, japonic, mumun, cultivators, or, assimilated, them, both, had, influence, on, each, other, and, a, later, founder, effect, diminished, the, internal, variety, of, both, language, families, since, the, establishment, of, two, independent, governments, north, south, differences, have, developed, in, standard, korean, including, variations, in, pronunciation, and, vocabulary, chosen, however, these, minor, differences, can, be, found, in, any, of, the, korean, dialects, which, are, still, largely, mutually, intelligible, chinese, characters, arrived, in, korea, see, sino, xenic, pronunciations, for, further, information, during, the, proto, three, kingdoms, era, in, the, 1st, century, bc, they, were, adapted, for, korean, and, became, known, as, hanja, and, remained, as, the, main, script, for, writing, korean, for, over, a, millennium, alongside, various, phonetic, scripts, that, were, later, invented, such, as, idu, gugyeol, and, hyangchal, mainly, privileged, elites, were, educated, to, read, and, write, in, hanja, however, most, of, the, population, was, illiterate, in, the, 15th, century, king, sejong, the, great, personally, developed, an, alphabetic, featural, writing, system, known, today, as, hangul, he, felt, that, hanja, was, inadequate, to, write, korean, and, that, caused, its, very, restricted, use, hangul, was, designed, to, either, aid, in, reading, hanja, or, to, replace, hanja, entirely, introduced, in, the, document, hunminjeongeum, it, was, called, eonmun, colloquial, script, and, quickly, spread, nationwide, to, increase, literacy, in, korea, hangul, was, widely, used, by, all, the, korean, classes, but, was, often, treated, as, amkeul, script, for, women, and, disregarded, by, privileged, elites, and, hanja, was, regarded, as, jinseo, true, text, consequently, official, documents, were, always, written, in, hanja, during, the, joseon, era, since, few, people, could, understand, hanja, korean, kings, sometimes, released, public, notices, entirely, written, in, hangul, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, for, all, korean, classes, including, uneducated, peasants, and, slaves, by, the, 17th, century, the, elite, class, of, yangban, had, exchanged, hangul, letters, with, slaves, which, suggests, a, high, literacy, rate, of, hangul, during, the, joseon, era, today, hanja, is, largely, unused, in, everyday, life, because, of, its, inconvenience, but, it, is, still, important, for, historical, and, linguistic, studies, neither, south, korea, nor, north, korea, opposes, the, learning, of, hanja, but, they, are, no, longer, officially, used, in, north, korea, and, their, usage, in, south, korea, is, mainly, reserved, for, specific, circumstances, such, as, newspapers, scholarly, papers, and, disambiguation, the, korean, names, for, the, language, are, based, on, the, names, for, korea, used, in, both, south, korea, and, north, korea, the, english, word, korean, is, derived, from, goryeo, which, is, thought, to, be, the, first, korean, dynasty, known, to, western, nations, korean, people, in, the, former, ussr, refer, to, themselves, as, koryo, saram, or, koryo, in, literally, koryo, goryeo, persons, and, call, the, language, koryo, mal, some, older, english, sources, also, use, the, spelling, corea, to, refer, to, the, nation, and, its, inflected, form, for, the, language, culture, and, people, korea, becoming, more, popular, in, the, late, 1800s, in, south, korea, the, korean, language, is, referred, to, by, many, names, including, hanguk, eo, korean, language, hanguk, mal, korean, speech, and, uri, mal, our, language, hanguk, is, taken, from, the, name, of, the, korean, empire, daehan, jeguk, the, han, in, hanguk, and, daehan, jeguk, is, derived, from, samhan, in, reference, to, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, not, the, ancient, confederacies, in, the, southern, korean, peninsula, while, eo, and, mal, mean, language, and, speech, respectively, korean, is, also, simply, referred, to, as, guk, eo, literally, national, language, this, name, is, based, on, the, same, han, characters, nation, language, that, are, also, used, in, taiwan, and, japan, to, refer, to, their, respective, national, languages, in, north, korea, and, china, the, language, is, most, often, called, joseon, mal, or, more, formally, joseon, o, this, is, taken, from, the, north, korean, name, for, korea, joseon, a, name, retained, from, the, joseon, dynasty, until, the, proclamation, of, the, korean, empire, which, in, turn, was, annexed, by, the, empire, of, japan, in, mainland, china, following, the, establishment, of, diplomatic, relations, with, south, korea, in, 1992, the, term, ch, oxi, ny, or, the, short, form, ch, oy, has, normally, been, used, to, refer, to, the, standard, language, of, north, korea, and, yanbian, whereas, h, ngu, y, or, the, short, form, h, ny, is, used, to, refer, to, the, standard, language, of, south, korea, korean, is, a, member, of, the, koreanic, family, along, with, the, jeju, language, some, linguists, have, included, it, in, the, altaic, family, but, the, core, altaic, proposal, itself, has, lost, most, of, its, prior, support, the, khitan, language, has, several, vocabulary, items, similar, to, korean, that, are, not, found, in, other, mongolian, or, tungusic, languages, suggesting, a, korean, influence, on, khitan, the, hypothesis, that, korean, could, be, related, to, japanese, has, had, some, supporters, due, to, some, overlap, in, vocabulary, and, similar, grammatical, features, that, have, been, elaborated, upon, by, such, researchers, as, samuel, e, martin, and, roy, andrew, miller, sergei, starostin, 1991, found, about, 25, of, potential, cognates, in, the, japanese, korean, 100, word, swadesh, list, some, linguists, concerned, with, the, issue, between, japanese, and, korean, including, alexander, vovin, have, argued, that, the, indicated, similarities, are, not, due, to, any, genetic, relationship, but, rather, to, a, sprachbund, effect, and, heavy, borrowing, especially, from, ancient, korean, into, western, old, japanese, a, good, example, might, be, middle, korean, s, m, and, japanese, as, meaning, hemp, this, word, seems, to, be, a, cognate, but, although, it, is, well, attested, in, western, old, japanese, and, northern, ryukyuan, languages, in, eastern, old, japanese, it, only, occurs, in, compounds, and, it, is, only, present, in, three, dialects, of, the, southern, ryukyuan, language, group, also, the, doublet, wo, meaning, hemp, is, attested, in, western, old, japanese, and, southern, ryukyuan, languages, it, is, thus, plausible, to, assume, a, borrowed, term, see, classification, of, the, japonic, languages, or, comparison, of, japanese, and, korean, for, further, details, on, a, possible, relationship, hudson, robbeets, 2020, suggested, that, there, are, traces, of, a, pre, nivkh, substratum, in, korean, according, to, the, hypothesis, ancestral, varieties, of, nivkh, also, known, as, amuric, were, once, distributed, on, the, korean, peninsula, before, the, arrival, of, koreanic, speakers, korean, syllable, structure, is, c, g, v, c, consisting, of, an, optional, onset, consonant, glide, j, w, and, final, coda, p, t, k, m, n, l, surrounding, a, core, vowel, the, ipa, symbol, u, 0348, combining, double, vertical, line, below, is, used, to, denote, the, tensed, consonants, p, t, k, t, s, its, official, use, in, the, extensions, to, the, ipa, is, for, strong, articulation, but, is, used, in, the, literature, for, faucalized, voice, the, korean, consonants, also, have, elements, of, stiff, voice, but, it, is, not, yet, known, how, typical, this, is, of, faucalized, consonants, they, are, produced, with, a, partially, constricted, glottis, and, additional, subglottal, pressure, in, addition, to, tense, vocal, tract, walls, laryngeal, lowering, or, other, expansion, of, the, larynx, s, is, aspirated, and, becomes, an, alveolo, palatal, before, or, for, most, speakers, but, see, north, south, differences, in, the, korean, language, this, occurs, with, the, tense, fricative, and, all, the, affricates, as, well, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, s, changes, to, t, example, beoseot, mushroom, h, may, become, a, bilabial, before, or, a, palatal, before, or, a, velar, before, a, voiced, between, voiced, sounds, and, a, elsewhere, p, t, t, k, become, voiced, between, voiced, sounds, m, n, frequently, denasalize, at, the, beginnings, of, words, l, becomes, alveolar, flap, between, vowels, and, or, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, or, next, to, another, l, a, written, syllable, final, when, followed, by, a, vowel, or, a, glide, i, e, when, the, next, character, starts, with, migrates, to, the, next, syllable, and, thus, becomes, traditionally, l, was, disallowed, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, it, disappeared, before, and, otherwise, became, n, however, the, inflow, of, western, loanwords, changed, the, trend, and, now, word, initial, l, mostly, from, english, loanwords, are, pronounced, as, a, free, variation, of, either, or, all, obstruents, plosives, affricates, fricatives, at, the, end, of, a, word, are, pronounced, with, no, audible, release, plosive, sounds, p, t, k, become, nasals, before, nasal, sounds, hangul, spelling, does, not, reflect, these, assimilatory, pronunciation, rules, but, rather, maintains, the, underlying, partly, historical, morphology, given, this, it, is, sometimes, hard, to, tell, which, actual, phonemes, are, present, in, a, certain, word, the, traditional, prohibition, of, word, initial, became, a, morphological, rule, called, initial, law, in, the, pronunciation, standards, of, south, korea, which, pertains, to, sino, korean, vocabulary, such, words, retain, their, word, initial, in, the, pronunciation, standards, of, north, korea, for, example, note, is, closer, to, a, near, open, central, vowel, though, a, is, still, used, for, tradition, grammatical, morphemes, may, change, shape, depending, on, the, preceding, sounds, examples, include, eun, neun, and, i, ga, sometimes, sounds, may, be, inserted, instead, examples, include, eul, reul, euro, ro, eseo, seo, ideunji, deunji, and, iya, ya, some, verbs, may, also, change, shape, morphophonemically, korean, is, an, agglutinative, language, the, korean, language, is, traditionally, considered, to, have, nine, parts, of, speech, modifiers, generally, precede, the, modified, words, and, in, the, case, of, verb, modifiers, can, be, serially, appended, the, sentence, structure, or, basic, form, of, a, korean, sentence, is, subject, object, verb, sov, but, the, verb, is, the, only, required, and, immovable, element, and, word, order, is, highly, flexible, as, in, many, other, agglutinative, languages, the, relationship, between, a, speaker, writer, and, their, subject, and, audience, is, paramount, in, korean, grammar, the, relationship, between, the, speaker, writer, and, subject, referent, is, reflected, in, honorifics, whereas, that, between, speaker, writer, and, audience, is, reflected, in, speech, level, when, talking, about, someone, superior, in, status, a, speaker, or, writer, usually, uses, special, nouns, or, verb, endings, to, indicate, the, subject, s, superiority, generally, someone, is, superior, in, status, if, they, are, an, older, relative, a, stranger, of, roughly, equal, or, greater, age, or, an, employer, teacher, customer, or, the, like, someone, is, equal, or, inferior, in, status, if, they, are, a, younger, stranger, student, employee, or, the, like, nowadays, there, are, special, endings, which, can, be, used, on, declarative, interrogative, and, imperative, sentences, and, both, honorific, or, normal, sentences, honorifics, in, traditional, korea, were, strictly, hierarchical, the, caste, and, estate, systems, possessed, patterns, and, usages, much, more, complex, and, stratified, than, those, used, today, the, intricate, structure, of, the, korean, honorific, system, flourished, in, traditional, culture, and, society, honorifics, in, contemporary, korea, are, now, used, for, people, who, are, psychologically, distant, honorifics, are, also, used, for, people, who, are, superior, in, status, such, as, older, people, teachers, and, employers, there, are, seven, verb, paradigms, or, speech, levels, in, korean, and, each, level, has, its, own, unique, set, of, verb, endings, which, are, used, to, indicate, the, level, of, formality, of, a, situation, unlike, honorifics, which, are, used, to, show, respect, towards, the, referent, the, person, spoken, of, speech, levels, are, used, to, show, respect, towards, a, speaker, s, or, writer, s, audience, the, person, spoken, to, the, names, of, the, seven, levels, are, derived, from, the, non, honorific, imperative, form, of, the, verb, hada, do, in, each, level, plus, the, suffix, che, hanja, which, means, style, the, three, levels, with, high, politeness, very, formally, polite, formally, polite, casually, polite, are, generally, grouped, together, as, jondaesmal, whereas, the, two, levels, with, low, politeness, formally, impolite, casually, impolite, are, banmal, in, korean, the, remaining, two, levels, neutral, formality, with, neutral, politeness, high, formality, with, neutral, politeness, are, neither, polite, nor, impolite, nowadays, younger, generation, speakers, no, longer, feel, obligated, to, lower, their, usual, regard, toward, the, referent, it, is, common, to, see, younger, people, talk, to, their, older, relatives, with, banmal, this, is, not, out, of, disrespect, but, instead, it, shows, the, intimacy, and, the, closeness, of, the, relationship, between, the, two, speakers, transformations, in, social, structures, and, attitudes, in, today, s, rapidly, changing, society, have, brought, about, change, in, the, way, people, speak, in, general, korean, lacks, grammatical, gender, as, one, of, the, few, exceptions, the, third, person, singular, pronoun, has, two, different, forms, geu, male, and, geu, nyeo, female, before, was, invented, in, need, of, translating, she, into, korean, was, the, only, third, person, singular, pronoun, and, had, no, grammatical, gender, its, origin, causes, never, to, be, used, in, spoken, korean, but, appearing, only, in, writing, to, have, a, more, complete, understanding, of, the, intricacies, of, gender, in, korean, three, models, of, language, and, gender, that, have, been, proposed, the, deficit, model, the, dominance, model, and, the, cultural, difference, model, in, the, deficit, model, male, speech, is, seen, as, the, default, and, any, form, of, speech, that, diverges, from, that, norm, female, speech, is, seen, as, lesser, than, the, dominance, model, sees, women, as, lacking, in, power, due, to, living, within, a, patriarchal, society, the, cultural, difference, model, proposes, that, the, difference, in, upbringing, between, men, and, women, can, explain, the, differences, in, their, speech, patterns, it, is, important, to, look, at, the, models, to, better, understand, the, misogynistic, conditions, that, shaped, the, ways, that, men, and, women, use, the, language, korean, s, lack, of, grammatical, gender, makes, it, different, from, most, european, languages, rather, gendered, differences, in, korean, can, be, observed, through, formality, intonation, word, choice, etc, however, one, can, still, find, stronger, contrasts, between, genders, within, korean, speech, some, examples, of, this, can, be, seen, in, 1, the, softer, tone, used, by, women, in, speech, 2, a, married, woman, introducing, herself, as, someone, s, mother, or, wife, not, with, her, own, name, 3, the, presence, of, gender, differences, in, titles, and, occupational, terms, for, example, a, sajang, is, a, company, president, and, y, sajang, is, a, female, company, president, 4, females, sometimes, using, more, tag, questions, and, rising, tones, in, statements, also, seen, in, speech, from, children, between, two, people, of, asymmetric, status, in, korean, society, people, tend, to, emphasize, differences, in, status, for, the, sake, of, solidarity, koreans, prefer, to, use, kinship, terms, rather, than, any, other, terms, of, reference, in, traditional, korean, society, women, have, long, been, in, disadvantaged, positions, korean, social, structure, traditionally, was, a, patriarchically, dominated, family, system, that, emphasized, the, maintenance, of, family, lines, that, structure, has, tended, to, separate, the, roles, of, women, from, those, of, men, cho, and, whitman, 2019, explore, how, categories, such, as, male, and, female, and, social, context, influence, korean, s, features, for, example, they, point, out, that, usage, of, jagi, you, is, dependent, on, context, among, middle, aged, women, jagi, is, used, to, address, someone, who, is, close, to, them, while, young, koreans, use, jagi, to, address, their, lovers, or, spouses, regardless, of, gender, korean, society, s, prevalent, attitude, towards, men, being, in, public, outside, the, home, and, women, living, in, private, still, exists, today, for, instance, the, word, for, husband, is, bakkat, yangban, outside, nobleman, but, a, husband, introduces, his, wife, as, an, saram, an, inside, person, also, in, kinship, terminology, we, outside, or, wrong, is, added, for, maternal, grandparents, creating, oe, harabeoji, and, oe, hal, meoni, grandfather, and, grandmother, with, different, lexicons, for, males, and, females, and, patriarchal, society, revealed, further, in, interrogatives, to, an, addressee, of, equal, or, lower, status, korean, men, tend, to, use, haennya, did, it, in, aggressive, masculinity, but, women, use, haenni, did, it, as, a, soft, expression, however, there, are, exceptions, korean, society, used, the, question, endings, ni, and, nya, the, former, prevailing, among, women, and, men, until, a, few, decades, ago, in, fact, nya, was, characteristic, of, the, jeolla, and, chungcheong, dialects, however, since, the, 1950s, large, numbers, of, people, have, moved, to, seoul, from, chungcheong, and, jeolla, and, they, began, to, influence, the, way, men, speak, recently, women, also, have, used, the, nya, as, for, ni, it, is, usually, used, toward, people, to, be, polite, even, to, someone, not, close, or, younger, as, for, nya, it, is, used, mainly, to, close, friends, regardless, of, gender, like, the, case, of, actor, and, actress, it, also, is, possible, to, add, a, gender, prefix, for, emphasis, biseo, secretary, is, sometimes, combined, with, yeo, female, to, form, yeo, biseo, female, secretary, namja, man, often, is, added, to, ganhosa, nurse, to, form, namja, ganhosa, male, nurse, another, crucial, difference, between, men, and, women, is, the, tone, and, pitch, of, their, voices, and, how, they, affect, the, perception, of, politeness, men, learn, to, use, an, authoritative, falling, tone, in, korean, culture, a, deeper, voice, is, associated, with, being, more, polite, in, addition, to, the, deferential, speech, endings, being, used, men, are, seen, as, more, polite, as, well, as, impartial, and, professional, while, women, who, use, a, rising, tone, in, conjunction, with, yo, are, not, perceived, to, be, as, polite, as, men, the, yo, also, indicates, uncertainty, since, the, ending, has, many, prefixes, that, indicate, uncertainty, and, questioning, while, the, deferential, ending, has, no, prefixes, to, indicate, uncertainty, the, hamnida, ending, is, the, most, polite, and, formal, form, of, korea, and, the, yo, ending, is, less, polite, and, formal, which, reinforces, the, perception, of, women, as, less, professional, hedges, and, euphemisms, to, soften, assertions, are, common, in, women, s, speech, women, traditionally, add, nasal, sounds, neyng, neym, ney, e, in, the, last, syllable, more, frequently, than, men, often, l, is, added, in, women, s, for, female, stereotypes, and, so, igeolo, this, thing, becomes, igeollo, this, thing, to, communicate, a, lack, of, confidence, and, passivity, women, use, more, linguistic, markers, such, as, exclamation, eomeo, oh, and, eojjeom, what, a, surprise, than, men, do, in, cooperative, communication, the, core, of, the, korean, vocabulary, is, made, up, of, native, korean, words, however, a, significant, proportion, of, the, vocabulary, especially, words, that, denote, abstract, ideas, are, sino, korean, words, of, chinese, origin, to, a, much, lesser, extent, some, words, have, also, been, borrowed, from, mongolian, and, other, languages, more, recent, loanwords, are, dominated, by, english, in, south, korea, it, is, widely, believed, that, north, korea, wanted, to, emphasize, the, use, of, unique, korean, expressions, in, its, language, and, eliminate, the, influence, of, foreign, languages, however, according, to, researchers, such, as, jeon, soo, tae, who, has, seen, first, hand, data, from, north, korea, the, country, has, reduced, the, number, of, difficult, foreign, words, in, a, similar, way, to, south, korea, in, 2021, moon, sung, guk, of, kim, il, sung, university, in, north, korea, wrote, in, his, thesis, that, kim, jong, il, had, said, that, vernacularized, sino, korean, vocabulary, should, be, used, as, it, is, not, modified, a, language, is, in, constant, interaction, with, other, languages, and, in, the, process, it, is, constantly, being, developed, and, enriched, he, said, according, to, the, paper, kim, jong, il, argued, that, academic, terms, used, in, the, natural, sciences, and, engineering, such, as, compyut, computer, and, had, dis, k, hard, disk, should, remain, in, the, names, of, their, inventors, and, that, the, word, ch, okolet, chocolate, should, not, be, replaced, because, it, had, been, used, for, so, long, south, korea, defines, its, vocabulary, standards, through, the, standard, korean, language, dictionary, and, north, korea, defines, its, vocabulary, standards, through, the, korean, language, dictionary, sino, korean, vocabulary, consists, of, therefore, just, like, other, words, korean, has, two, sets, of, numeral, systems, english, is, similar, having, native, english, words, and, latinate, equivalents, such, as, water, aqua, fire, flame, sea, marine, two, dual, sun, solar, star, stellar, however, unlike, english, and, latin, which, belong, to, the, same, indo, european, languages, family, and, bear, a, certain, resemblance, korean, and, chinese, are, genetically, unrelated, and, the, two, sets, of, korean, words, differ, completely, from, each, other, all, sino, korean, morphemes, are, monosyllabic, as, in, chinese, whereas, native, korean, morphemes, can, be, polysyllabic, the, sino, korean, words, were, deliberately, imported, alongside, corresponding, chinese, characters, for, a, written, language, and, everything, was, supposed, to, be, written, in, hanja, so, the, coexistence, of, sino, korean, would, be, more, thorough, and, systematic, than, that, of, latinate, words, in, english, the, exact, proportion, of, sino, korean, vocabulary, is, a, matter, of, debate, sohn, 2001, stated, 50, 60, in, 2006, the, same, author, gives, an, even, higher, estimate, of, 65, jeong, jae, do, one, of, the, compilers, of, the, dictionary, urimal, keun, sajeon, asserts, that, the, proportion, is, not, so, high, he, points, out, that, korean, dictionaries, compiled, during, the, colonial, period, include, many, unused, sino, korean, words, in, his, estimation, the, proportion, of, sino, korean, vocabulary, in, the, korean, language, might, be, as, low, as, 30, the, vast, majority, of, loanwords, other, than, sino, korean, come, from, modern, times, approximately, 90, of, which, are, from, english, many, words, have, also, been, borrowed, from, western, languages, such, as, german, via, japanese, e, g, areubaiteu, part, time, job, allereugi, allergy, gibseu, or, gibuseu, plaster, cast, used, for, broken, bones, some, western, words, were, borrowed, indirectly, via, japanese, during, the, japanese, occupation, of, korea, taking, a, japanese, sound, pattern, for, example, dozen, d, su, daseu, however, most, indirect, western, borrowings, are, now, written, according, to, current, hangulization, rules, for, the, respective, western, language, as, if, borrowed, directly, in, south, korean, official, use, a, number, of, other, sino, korean, country, names, have, been, replaced, with, phonetically, oriented, hangeulizations, of, the, countries, endonyms, or, english, names, because, of, such, a, prevalence, of, english, in, modern, south, korean, culture, and, society, lexical, borrowing, is, inevitable, english, derived, korean, or, konglish, is, increasingly, used, the, vocabulary, of, the, south, korean, dialect, of, the, korean, language, is, roughly, 5, loanwords, excluding, sino, korean, vocabulary, however, due, to, north, korea, s, isolation, such, influence, is, lacking, in, north, korean, speech, before, the, creation, of, the, modern, korean, alphabet, known, as, chos, n, g, l, in, north, korea, and, as, hangul, in, south, korea, people, in, korea, known, as, joseon, at, the, time, primarily, wrote, using, classical, chinese, alongside, native, phonetic, writing, systems, that, predate, hangul, by, hundreds, of, years, including, idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and, gakpil, few, people, in, the, lower, classes, had, the, opportunity, to, receive, an, education, and, they, found, it, extremely, difficult, to, learn, how, to, write, in, chinese, characters, due, to, the, fundamental, disparities, between, the, korean, and, chinese, languages, and, the, sheer, amount, of, characters, that, needed, to, be, taught, to, assuage, that, problem, king, sejong, r, 1418, 1450, created, the, unique, alphabet, known, as, hangul, to, promote, literacy, among, the, common, people, the, korean, alphabet, was, denounced, and, looked, down, upon, by, the, yangban, aristocracy, who, deemed, it, too, easy, to, learn, but, it, gained, widespread, use, among, the, common, class, and, was, widely, used, to, print, popular, novels, which, were, enjoyed, by, the, common, class, with, growing, korean, nationalism, in, the, 19th, century, the, gabo, reformists, push, and, the, promotion, of, hangul, in, schools, in, 1894, hangul, displaced, hanja, as, korea, s, national, script, hanja, are, still, used, to, a, certain, extent, in, south, korea, where, they, are, sometimes, combined, with, hangul, but, that, method, is, slowly, declining, in, use, even, though, students, learn, hanja, in, school, below, is, a, chart, of, the, korean, alphabet, s, hangul, symbols, and, their, revised, romanization, rr, and, canonical, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, values, the, letters, of, the, korean, alphabet, are, not, written, linearly, like, most, alphabets, but, instead, arranged, into, blocks, that, represent, syllables, so, while, the, word, bibimbap, korean, rice, dish, is, written, as, eight, characters, in, a, row, in, the, latin, alphabet, in, korean, it, is, written, as, three, syllabic, blocks, in, a, row, mukbang, eating, show, is, seven, characters, after, romanization, but, only, two, syllabic, blocks, before, modern, korean, is, written, with, spaces, between, words, a, feature, not, found, in, chinese, or, japanese, except, when, japanese, is, written, exclusively, in, hiragana, as, in, children, s, books, the, marks, used, for, korean, punctuation, are, almost, identical, to, western, ones, traditionally, korean, was, written, in, columns, from, top, to, bottom, right, to, left, like, traditional, chinese, however, the, syllabic, blocks, are, now, usually, written, in, rows, from, left, to, right, top, to, bottom, like, english, korean, has, numerous, small, local, dialects, called, mal, saturi, or, bang, eon, south, korean, authors, claim, that, the, standard, language, pyojun, eo, or, pyojun, mal, of, both, south, korea, and, north, korea, is, based, on, the, dialect, of, the, area, around, seoul, which, as, hanyang, was, the, capital, of, joseon, era, korea, for, 500, years, however, since, 1966, north, korea, officially, states, that, its, standard, is, based, on, the, pyongyang, speech, all, dialects, of, korean, are, similar, to, each, other, and, largely, mutually, intelligible, with, the, exception, of, dialect, specific, phrases, or, non, standard, vocabulary, unique, to, dialects, though, the, dialect, of, jeju, island, is, divergent, enough, to, be, generally, considered, a, separate, language, one, of, the, more, salient, differences, between, dialects, is, the, use, of, tone, speakers, of, the, seoul, dialect, make, use, of, vowel, length, whereas, speakers, of, the, gyeongsang, dialect, maintain, the, pitch, accent, of, middle, korean, some, dialects, are, conservative, maintaining, middle, korean, sounds, such, as, z, which, have, been, lost, from, the, standard, language, whereas, others, are, highly, innovative, kang, yoonjung, han, sungwoo, 2013, kim, mi, ryoung, 2013, and, cho, sunghye, 2017, suggest, that, the, modern, seoul, dialect, is, currently, undergoing, tonogenesis, based, on, the, finding, that, in, recent, years, lenis, consonants, aspirated, consonants, and, fortis, consonants, were, shifting, from, a, distinction, via, voice, onset, time, to, that, of, pitch, change, however, choi, jiyoun, kim, sahyang, cho, taehong, 2020, disagree, with, the, suggestion, that, the, consonant, distinction, shifting, away, from, voice, onset, time, is, due, to, the, introduction, of, tonal, features, and, instead, proposes, that, it, is, a, prosodically, conditioned, change, there, is, substantial, evidence, for, a, history, of, extensive, dialect, levelling, or, even, convergent, evolution, or, intermixture, of, two, or, more, originally, distinct, linguistic, stocks, within, the, korean, language, and, its, dialects, many, korean, dialects, have, basic, vocabulary, that, is, etymologically, distinct, from, vocabulary, of, identical, meaning, in, standard, korean, or, other, dialects, for, example, garlic, chives, translated, into, gyeongsang, dialect, t, u, d, i, jeongguji, but, in, standard, korean, it, is, pu, t, u, buchu, this, suggests, that, the, korean, peninsula, may, have, at, one, time, been, much, more, linguistically, diverse, than, it, is, at, present, see, also, the, japanese, koguryoic, languages, hypothesis, the, language, used, in, the, north, and, the, south, exhibit, differences, in, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, and, vocabulary, in, north, korea, palatalization, of, si, is, optional, and, t, can, be, pronounced, between, vowels, words, that, are, written, the, same, way, may, be, pronounced, differently, such, as, the, examples, below, the, pronunciations, below, are, given, in, revised, romanization, mccune, reischauer, and, modified, hangul, what, the, korean, characters, would, be, if, one, were, to, write, the, word, as, pronounced, in, the, north, similar, pronunciation, is, used, whenever, the, hanja, is, attached, to, a, sino, korean, word, ending, in, or, in, the, south, this, rule, only, applies, when, it, is, attached, to, any, single, character, sino, korean, word, some, words, are, spelled, differently, by, the, north, and, the, south, but, the, pronunciations, are, the, same, basically, the, standard, languages, of, north, and, south, korea, including, pronunciation, and, vocabulary, are, both, linguistically, based, on, the, seoul, dialect, but, in, north, korea, words, have, been, modified, to, reflect, the, theories, of, scholars, like, kim, tu, bong, who, sought, a, refined, language, as, well, as, political, needs, some, differences, are, difficult, to, explain, in, terms, of, political, ideas, such, as, north, korea, s, use, of, the, word, rajio, in, general, when, transcribing, place, names, north, korea, tends, to, use, the, pronunciation, in, the, original, language, more, than, south, korea, which, often, uses, the, pronunciation, in, english, for, example, some, grammatical, constructions, are, also, different, in, the, north, guillemets, and, are, the, symbols, used, for, quotes, in, the, south, quotation, marks, equivalent, to, the, english, ones, and, are, standard, although, and, are, also, used, some, vocabulary, is, different, between, the, north, and, the, south, joseoneo, chos, n, is, officially, used, in, the, north, such, changes, were, made, after, the, korean, war, and, the, ideological, battle, between, the, anti, communist, government, in, the, south, and, north, korea, s, communism, korean, is, spoken, by, the, korean, people, in, both, south, korea, and, north, korea, and, by, the, korean, diaspora, in, many, countries, including, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, united, states, japan, and, russia, in, 2001, korean, was, the, fourth, most, popular, foreign, language, in, china, following, english, japanese, and, russian, korean, speaking, minorities, exist, in, these, states, but, because, of, cultural, assimilation, into, host, countries, not, all, ethnic, koreans, may, speak, it, with, native, fluency, korean, is, the, official, language, of, south, korea, and, north, korea, it, along, with, mandarin, chinese, is, also, one, of, the, two, official, languages, of, china, s, yanbian, korean, autonomous, prefecture, in, north, korea, the, regulatory, body, is, the, language, institute, of, the, academy, of, social, sciences, sahoe, gwahagweon, eohag, yeonguso, in, south, korea, the, regulatory, body, for, korean, is, the, seoul, based, national, institute, of, the, korean, language, which, was, created, by, presidential, decree, on, 23, january, 1991, established, pursuant, to, article, 9, section, 2, of, the, framework, act, on, the, national, language, the, king, sejong, institute, is, a, public, institution, set, up, to, coordinate, the, government, s, project, of, propagating, korean, language, and, culture, it, also, supports, the, king, sejong, institute, which, is, the, institution, s, overseas, branch, the, king, sejong, institute, was, established, in, response, to, king, sejong, institute, has, 59, in, europe, 15, in, africa, 146, in, asia, 34, in, the, americas, and, 4, in, oceania, the, topik, korea, institute, is, a, lifelong, educational, center, affiliated, with, a, variety, of, korean, universities, in, seoul, south, korea, whose, aim, is, to, promote, korean, language, and, culture, support, local, korean, teaching, internationally, and, facilitate, cultural, exchanges, the, institute, is, sometimes, compared, to, language, and, culture, promotion, organizations, such, as, the, king, sejong, institute, unlike, that, organization, however, the, topik, korea, institute, operates, within, established, universities, and, colleges, around, the, world, providing, educational, materials, in, countries, around, the, world, korean, embassies, and, cultural, centers, administer, topik, examinations, for, native, english, speakers, korean, is, generally, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, difficult, foreign, languages, to, master, despite, the, relative, ease, of, learning, hangul, for, instance, the, united, states, defense, language, institute, places, korean, in, category, iv, with, japanese, chinese, mandarin, and, cantonese, and, arabic, requiring, 64, weeks, of, instruction, as, compared, to, just, 26, weeks, for, category, i, languages, like, italian, french, and, spanish, to, bring, an, english, speaking, student, to, a, limited, working, level, of, proficiency, in, which, they, have, sufficient, capability, to, meet, routine, social, demands, and, limited, job, requirements, and, can, deal, with, concrete, topics, in, past, present, and, future, tense, similarly, the, foreign, service, institute, s, school, of, language, studies, places, korean, in, category, iv, the, highest, level, of, difficulty, the, study, of, the, korean, language, in, the, united, states, is, dominated, by, korean, american, heritage, language, students, in, 2007, these, students, were, estimated, to, form, over, 80, of, all, students, of, the, language, at, non, military, universities, however, sejong, institutes, in, the, united, states, have, noted, a, sharp, rise, in, the, number, of, people, of, other, ethnic, backgrounds, studying, korean, between, 2009, and, 2011, which, they, attribute, to, rising, popularity, of, south, korean, music, and, television, shows, in, 2018, it, was, reported, that, the, rise, in, k, pop, was, responsible, for, the, increase, in, people, learning, the, language, in, us, universities, there, are, two, widely, used, tests, of, korean, as, a, foreign, language, the, korean, language, proficiency, test, klpt, and, the, test, of, proficiency, in, korean, topik, the, korean, language, proficiency, test, an, examination, aimed, at, assessing, non, native, speakers, competence, in, korean, was, instituted, in, 1997, 17, 000, people, applied, for, the, 2005, sitting, of, the, examination, the, topik, was, first, administered, in, 1997, and, was, taken, by, 2, 274, people, since, then, the, total, number, of, people, who, have, taken, the, topik, has, surpassed, 1, million, with, more, than, 150, 000, candidates, taking, the, test, in, 2012, topik, is, administered, in, 45, regions, within, south, korea, and, 72, nations, outside, of, south, korea, with, a, significant, portion, being, administered, in, japan, and, north, america, which, would, suggest, the, targeted, audience, for, topik, is, still, primarily, foreigners, of, korean, heritage, this, is, also, evident, in, topik, s, website, where, the, examination, is, introduced, as, intended, for, korean, heritage, students, from, article, 1,
