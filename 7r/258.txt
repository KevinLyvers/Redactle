the, tibetan, people, tibetan, wylie, bod, pa, thl, b, pa, are, an, east, asian, ethnic, group, native, to, tibet, their, current, population, is, estimated, to, be, around, 6, 7, million, in, addition, to, the, majority, living, in, tibet, autonomous, region, of, china, significant, numbers, of, tibetans, live, in, the, chinese, provinces, of, gansu, qinghai, sichuan, and, yunnan, as, well, as, in, india, nepal, and, bhutan, the, tibetic, languages, belong, to, the, tibeto, burman, language, group, the, traditional, or, mythological, explanation, of, the, tibetan, people, s, origin, is, that, they, are, the, descendants, of, the, human, pha, trelgen, changchup, sempa, and, rock, ogress, ma, drag, sinmo, it, is, thought, that, most, of, the, tibeto, burman, speakers, in, southwest, china, including, tibetans, are, direct, descendants, from, the, ancient, qiang, people, most, tibetans, practice, tibetan, buddhism, although, a, significant, minority, observe, the, indigenous, bon, religion, there, are, also, smaller, communities, of, tibetan, muslims, and, christians, tibetan, buddhism, influences, tibetan, art, drama, and, architecture, while, the, harsh, geography, of, tibet, has, produced, an, adaptive, culture, of, tibetan, medicine, and, cuisine, as, of, the, 2014, census, there, are, about, 6, million, tibetans, living, in, the, tibet, autonomous, region, and, the, 10, tibetan, autonomous, prefectures, in, the, provinces, of, gansu, qinghai, sichuan, and, yunnan, the, sil, ethnologue, in, 2009, documents, an, additional, 189, 000, tibetic,

tibetans, the, central, tibetan, administration, claims, that, the, 5, 4, million, number, is, a, decrease, from, 6, 3, million, in, 1959, while, the, chinese, government, claims, that, it, is, an, increase, from, 2, 7, million, in, 1954, however, the, question, depends, on, the, definition, and, extent, of, tibet, the, region, claimed, by, the, cta, is, more, expansive, and, china, more, diminutive, also, the, tibetan, administration, did, not, take, a, formal, census, of, its, territory, in, the, 1950s, the, numbers, provided, by, the, administration, at, the, time, were, based, on,

diqing, tibetan, autonomous, prefecture, 33, in, india, tibetic, people, are, found, in, the, regions, of, ladakh, ladakhi, and, balti, kinnaur, district, in, himachal, pradesh, spiti, valley, uttarakhand, bhotiya, sikkim, bhutia, and, arunachal, pradesh, khamba, lhoba, and, monpa, people, there, are, also, nearly, 100, 000, tibetans, living, in, exile, in, india, since, 1959, the, majority, of, them, living, in, tibetan, enclaves, such, as, dharamshala, and, bylakuppe, in, 2011, the, indian, government, reported, 150, 000, tibetan, diaspora, residing, in, india, in, 2019, the, number, of, tibetan, diaspora, in, india, declined, to, 85, 000, tibetans, are, known, as, bhotiyas, in, nepal, where, they, are, majority, in, regions, such, as, upper, mustang, dolpo, walung, region, and, limi, and, muchu, valleys, nepal, is, also, home, to, other, tibetic, people, such, as, the, sherpa, hyolmo, and, tamang, there, are, also, more, than, 10, 000, tibetan, refugees, in, nepal, the, tibetic, languages, tibetan, are, a, cluster, of, mutually, unintelligible, sino, tibetan, languages, spoken, by, approximately, 8, million, people, primarily, tibetan, living, across, a, wide, area, of, east, and, south, asia, including, the, tibetan, plateau, and, baltistan, ladakh, nepal, sikkim, and, bhutan, classical, tibetan, is, a, major, regional, literary, language, particularly, for, its, use, in, buddhist, literature, the, central, tibetan, language, the, dialects, of, tsang, including, lhasa, khams, tibetan, and, amdo, tibetan, are, generally, considered, to, be, dialects, of, a, single, language, especially, since, they, all, share, the, same, literary, language, while, dzongkha, sikkimese, sherpa, and, ladakhi, are, generally, considered, to, be, separate, languages, the, ethnic, roots, of, tibetans, can, be, traced, back, to, a, deep, eastern, asian, lineage, representing, the, indigenous, population, of, the, tibetan, plateau, since, c, 40, 000, to, 30, 000, years, ago, and, arriving, neolithic, farmers, from, the, yellow, river, within, the, last, 10, 000, years, and, which, can, be, associated, with, having, introduced, the, sino, tibetan, languages, modern, tibetan, populations, are, genetically, most, similar, to, other, east, asian, populations, especially, han, chinese, bhutanese, as, well, as, other, sino, tibetan, speaking, populations, they, show, relatively, more, genetic, affinity, for, modern, central, asian, than, modern, siberian, populations, they, also, share, some, genetic, affinity, for, south, asian, groups, genetic, studies, shows, that, many, of, the, sherpa, people, have, allele, frequencies, which, are, often, found, in, other, tibeto, burman, regions, the, strongest, affinity, was, for, tibetan, population, sample, studies, done, in, the, tibet, autonomous, region, genetically, the, sherpa, cluster, closest, with, the, sampled, tibetan, and, han, populations, additionally, the, sherpa, and, tibetans, had, exhibited, affinity, for, several, nepalese, populations, with, the, strongest, for, the, rai, people, followed, by, the, magars, and, the, tamang, tibetan, males, predominantly, belong, to, the, paternal, lineage, d, m174, followed, by, lower, amounts, of, o, m175, tibetan, females, belong, mainly, to, the, northeast, asian, maternal, haplogroups, m9a1a, m9a1b, d4g2, d4i, and, g2ac, showing, continuity, with, ancient, middle, and, upper, yellow, river, populations, although, east, asian, highlanders, associated, with, haplogroup, d1, are, closely, related, to, east, asian, lowland, farmers, associated, with, haplogroup, o, they, form, a, divergent, sister, branch, to, them, full, genome, studies, revealed, that, tibetans, and, other, high, alltitude, east, asians, formed, from, two, divergent, ancient, east, eurasian, lineages, in, eastern, asia, specifically, a, lineage, representing, the, paleolithic, population, of, the, tibetan, plateau, and, a, lineage, associated, with, ancient, northern, east, asians, the, paleolithic, tibetan, lineage, was, found, to, be, distinct, from, other, deep, lineages, such, as, ust, ishim, hoabinhian, onge, or, tianyuan, but, forming, a, clade, with, them, to, the, exclusion, of, other, eurasians, the, northern, east, asian, lineage, can, be, represented, by, neolithic, yellow, river, farmers, which, are, associated, with, the, spread, of, sino, tibetan, languages, modern, tibetans, derive, up, to, 20, from, paleolithic, tibetans, with, the, remaining, 80, being, primarily, derived, from, yellow, river, farmers, the, formation, of, the, present, day, tibetan, gene, pool, dates, back, at, least, 5, 100, years, bp, northeastern, tibetans, display, additional, geneflow, from, a, yellow, river, farmers, like, population, c, 4, 700, years, ago, resulting, in, the, formation, of, a, tibetan, cline, modern, tibetans, display, genetic, continuity, to, ancient, samples, from, nepal, with, their, genetic, diversity, having, been, reduced, compared, to, early, ancient, tibetans, suggesting, low, to, none, geneflow, from, outside, groups, since, c, 3, 500, years, ago, subsequent, internal, geneflow, resulted, in, a, northeastern, plateau, ancestry, associated, with, the, northeast, cluster, a, southern, plateau, ancestry, associated, with, the, south, southwest, cluster, and, a, southeastern, plateau, ancestry, associated, with, the, southeast, central, cluster, there, was, limited, contact, with, central, asian, populations, inline, with, historical, events, evident, in, mutual, geneflow, the, expansion, of, the, tibetan, empire, may, have, left, genetic, traces, in, surrounding, populations, genetic, studies, identified, more, than, 30, genetic, factors, that, make, tibetans, bodies, well, suited, for, high, altitudes, including, the, epas1, gene, also, referred, to, as, the, super, athlete, gene, which, regulates, the, body, s, production, of, hemoglobin, allowing, for, greater, efficiency, in, the, use, of, oxygen, the, genetic, basis, of, tibetan, adaptations, have, been, attributed, to, a, mutation, in, the, epas1, gene, and, has, become, prevalent, in, the, past, 5, 000, years, ancient, tibetans, carried, this, allele, at, a, frequency, of, 25, 58, while, modern, tibetans, carry, it, at, a, frequency, of, 75, the, widespread, presence, of, this, gene, may, represent, one, of, the, fastest, genetic, change, ever, observed, in, humans, recent, research, into, the, ability, of, tibetans, metabolism, to, function, normally, in, the, oxygen, deficient, atmosphere, above, 4, 400, metres, 14, 400, ft, shows, that, although, tibetans, living, at, high, altitudes, have, no, more, oxygen, in, their, blood, than, other, people, they, have, ten, times, more, nitric, oxide, and, double, the, forearm, blood, flow, of, low, altitude, dwellers, tibetans, inherited, this, adaptation, due, to, selected, genes, associated, with, denisovan, admixture, among, asian, populations, highlighting, how, different, environments, trigger, different, selective, pressures, nitric, oxide, causes, dilation, of, blood, vessels, allowing, blood, to, flow, more, freely, to, the, extremities, and, aids, the, release, of, oxygen, to, tissues, according, to, tibetan, mythology, the, origins, of, tibetans, are, said, to, be, rooted, in, the, marriage, of, the, monkey, pha, trelgen, changchup, sempa, and, rock, ogress, ma, drag, sinmo, most, tibetans, generally, observe, tibetan, buddhism, or, a, collection, of, native, traditions, known, as, b, n, also, absorbed, into, mainstream, tibetan, buddhism, there, is, a, minority, tibetan, muslim, population, there, is, also, a, small, tibetan, christian, population, in, the, eastern, tibet, and, northwestern, yunnan, of, china, also, there, are, some, tibetan, hindus, who, mainly, live, in, china, india, and, nepal, according, to, legend, the, 28th, king, of, tibet, thothori, nyantsen, dreamed, of, a, sacred, treasure, falling, from, heaven, which, contained, a, buddhist, sutra, mantras, and, religious, objects, however, because, the, tibetan, script, had, not, been, invented, the, text, could, not, be, translated, in, writing, and, no, one, initially, knew, what, was, written, in, it, buddhism, did, not, take, root, in, tibet, until, the, reign, of, songts, n, gampo, who, married, two, buddhist, princesses, bhrikuti, of, nepal, and, wencheng, of, china, it, then, gained, popularity, when, padmasambh, va, visited, tibet, at, the, invitation, of, the, 38th, tibetan, king, trisong, deutson, today, one, can, see, tibetans, placing, mani, stones, prominently, in, public, places, tibetan, lamas, both, buddhist, and, b, n, play, a, major, role, in, the, lives, of, the, tibetan, people, conducting, religious, ceremonies, and, taking, care, of, the, monasteries, pilgrims, plant, prayer, flags, over, sacred, grounds, as, a, symbol, of, good, luck, the, prayer,

order, not, to, desecrate, religious, artifacts, such, as, stupas, mani, stones, and, gompas, tibetan, buddhists, walk, around, them, in, a, clockwise, direction, although, the, reverse, direction,

festivals, such, as, losar, shoton, linka, and, the, bathing, festival, are, deeply, rooted, in, indigenous, religion, and, also, contain, foreign, influences, each, person, takes, part, in, the, bathing, festival, three, times, at, birth, at, marriage, and, at, death, tibetan, art, is, deeply, religious, in, nature, from, the, exquisitely, detailed, statues, found, in, gonpas, to, wooden, carvings, and, the, intricate, designs, of, the, thangka, paintings, tibetan, art, can, be, found, in, almost, every, object, and, every, aspect, of, daily, life, thangka, paintings, a, syncretism, of, indian, scroll, painting, with, nepalese, and, kashmiri, painting, appeared, in, tibet, around, the, 8th, century, rectangular, and, painted, on, cotton, or, linen, they, usually, depict, traditional, motifs, including, religious, astrological, and, theological, subjects, and, sometimes, a, mandala, to, ensure, that, the, image, will, not, fade, organic, and, mineral, pigments, are, added, and, the, painting, is, framed, in, colorful, silk, brocades, tibetan, folk, opera, known, as, lhamo, is, a, combination, of, dances, chants, and, songs, the, repertoire, is, drawn, from, buddhist, stories, and, tibetan, history, tibetan, opera, was, founded, in, the, fourteenth, century, by, thang, tong, gyalpo, a, lama, and, a, bridge, builder, gyalpo, and, seven, girls, he, recruited, organized, the, first, performance, to, raise, funds, for, building, bridges, to, facilitate, transportation, in, tibet, the, tradition, continued, uninterrupted, for, nearly, seven, hundred, years, and, performances, are, held, on, various, festive, occasions, such, as, the, lingka, and, shoton, festival, the, performance, is, usually, a, drama, held, on, a, barren, stage, that, combines, dances, chants, and, songs, colorful, masks, are, sometimes, worn, to, identify, a, character, with, red, symbolizing, a, king, and, yellow, indicating, deities, and, lamas, the,

the, end, of, the, play, there, are, also, many, historical, myths, epics, written, by, high, lamas, about, the, reincarnation, of, a, chosen, one, who, will, do, great, things, the, most, unusual, feature, of, tibetan, architecture, is, that, many, of, the, houses, and, monasteries, are, built, on, elevated, sunny, sites, facing, the, south, they, are, commonly, made, of, a, mixture, of, rocks, wood, cement, and, earth, little, fuel, is, available, for, heating, or, lighting, so, flat, roofs, are, built, to, conserve, heat, and, multiple, windows, are, constructed, to, let, in, sunlight,
