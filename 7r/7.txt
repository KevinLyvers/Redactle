safety, is, the, state, of, being, safe, the, condition, of, being, protected, from, harm, or, other, danger, safety, can, also, refer, to, the, control, of, recognized, hazards, in, order, to, achieve, an, acceptable, level, of, risk, the, word, safety, entered, the, english, language, in, the, 14th, century, it, is, derived, from, latin, salvus, meaning, uninjured, in, good, health, safe, there, are, two, slightly, different, meanings, of, safety, for, example, home, safety, may, indicate, a, building, s, ability, to, protect, against, external, harm, events, such, as, weather, home, invasion, etc, or, may, indicate, that, its, internal, installations, such, as, appliances, stairs, etc, are, safe, not, dangerous, or, harmful, for, its, inhabitants, discussions, of, safety, often, include, mention, of, related, terms, security, is, such, a, term, with, time, the, definitions, between, these, two, have, often, become, interchanged, equated, and, frequently, appear, juxtaposed, in, the, same, sentence, readers, are, left, to, conclude, whether, they, comprise, a, redundancy, this, confuses, the, uniqueness, that, should, be, reserved, for, each, by, itself, when, seen, as, unique, as, we, intend, here, each, term, will, assume, its, rightful, place, in, influencing, and, being, influenced, by, the, other, safety, is, the, condition, of, a, steady, state, of, an, organization, or, place, doing, what, it, is, supposed, to, do, what, it, is, supposed, to, do, is, defined, in, terms, of, public, codes, and, standards, associated, architectural, and, engineering, designs, corporate, vision, and, mission, statements, and, operational, plans, and, personnel, policies, for, any, organization, place, or, function, large, or, small, safety, is, a, normative, concept, it, complies, with, situation, specific, definitions, of, what, is, expected, and, acceptable, using, this, definition, protection, from, a, home, s, external, threats, and, protection, from, its, internal, structural, and, equipment, failures, see, meanings, above, are, not, two, types, of, safety, but, rather, two, aspects, of, a, home, s, steady, state, in, the, world, of, everyday, affairs, not, all, goes, as, planned, some, entity, s, steady, state, is, challenged, this, is, where, security, science, which, is, of, more, recent, date, enters, drawing, from, the, definition, of, safety, then, security, is, the, process, or, means, physical, or, human, of, delaying, preventing, and, otherwise, protecting, against, external, or, internal, defects, dangers, loss, criminals, and, other, individuals, or, actions, that, threaten, hinder, or, destroy, an, organization, s, steady, state, and, deprive, it, of, its, intended, purpose, for, being, using, this, generic, definition, of, safety, it, is, possible, to, specify, the, elements, of, a, security, program, safety, can, be, limited, in, relation, to, some, guarantee, or, a, standard, of, insurance, to, the, quality, and, unharmful, function, of, an, object, or, organization, it, is, used, in, order, to, ensure, that, the, object, or, organization, will, do, only, what, it, is, meant, to, do, it, is, important, to, realize, that, safety, is, relative, eliminating, all, risk, if, even, possible, would, be, extremely, difficult, and, very, expensive, a, safe, situation, is, one, where, risks, of, injury, or, property, damage, are, low, and, manageable, when, something, is, called, safe, this, usually, means, that, it, is, safe, within, certain, reasonable, limits, and, parameters, for, example, a, medication, may, be, safe, for, most, people, under, most, circumstances, if, taken, in, a, certain, amount, a, choice, motivated, by, safety, may, have, other, unsafe, consequences, for, example, frail, elderly, people, are, sometimes, moved, out, of, their, homes, and, into, hospitals, or, skilled, nursing, homes, with, the, claim, that, this, will, improve, the, person, s, safety, the, safety, provided, is, that, daily, medications, will, be, supervised, the, person, will, not, need, to, engage, in, some, potentially, risky, activities, such, as, climbing, stairs, or, cooking, and, if, the, person, falls, down, someone, there, will, be, able, to, help, the, person, get, back, up, however, the, end, result, might, be, decidedly, unsafe, including, the, dangers, of, transfer, trauma, hospital, delirium, elder, abuse, hospital, acquired, infections, depression, anxiety, and, even, a, desire, to, die, there, is, a, distinction, between, products, that, meet, standards, that, are, safe, and, that, merely, feel, safe, the, highway, safety, community, uses, these, terms, normative, safety, is, achieved, when, a, product, or, design, meets, applicable, standards, and, practices, for, design, and, construction, or, manufacture, regardless, of, the, product, s, actual, safety, history, substantive, or, objective, safety, occurs, when, the, real, world, safety, history, is, favorable, whether, or, not, standards, are, met, perceived, or, subjective, safety, refers, to, the, users, level, of, comfort, and, perception, of, risk, without, consideration, of, standards, or, safety, history, for, example, traffic, signals, are, perceived, as, safe, yet, under, some, circumstances, they, can, increase, traffic, crashes, at, an, intersection, traffic, roundabouts, have, a, generally, favorable, safety, record, yet, often, make, drivers, nervous, low, perceived, safety, can, have, costs, for, example, after, the, 9, 11, attacks, in, 2001, many, people, chose, to, drive, rather, than, fly, despite, the, fact, that, even, counting, terrorist, attacks, flying, is, safer, than, driving, perceived, risk, discourages, people, from, walking, and, bicycling, for, transportation, enjoyment, or, exercise, even, though, the, health, benefits, outweigh, the, risk, of, injury, perceived, safety, can, drive, regulation, which, increases, costs, and, inconvenience, without, improving, actual, safety, also, called, social, safety, or, public, safety, security, addresses, the, risk, of, harm, due, to, intentional, criminal, acts, such, as, assault, burglary, or, vandalism, because, of, the, moral, issues, involved, security, is, of, higher, importance, to, many, people, than, substantive, safety, for, example, a, death, due, to, murder, is, considered, worse, than, a, death, in, a, car, crash, even, though, in, many, countries, traffic, deaths, are, more, common, than, homicides, operational, safety, is, the, absence, of, unacceptable, risk, in, the, presence, of, the, associated, hazards, that, are, known, expected, or, reasonably, assumed, to, exist, during, a, planned, activity, and, any, likely, contingencies, associated, with, it, safety, is, generally, interpreted, as, implying, a, real, and, significant, impact, on, risk, of, death, injury, or, damage, to, property, in, response, to, perceived, risks, many, interventions, may, be, proposed, with, engineering, responses, and, regulation, being, two, of, the, most, common, probably, the, most, common, individual, response, to, perceived, safety, issues, is, insurance, which, compensates, for, or, provides, restitution, in, the, case, of, damage, or, loss, system, safety, and, reliability, engineering, is, an, engineering, discipline, continuous, changes, in, technology, environmental, regulation, and, public, safety, concerns, make, the, analysis, of, complex, safety, critical, systems, more, and, more, demanding, a, common, fallacy, for, example, among, electrical, engineers, regarding, structure, power, systems, is, that, safety, issues, can, be, readily, deduced, in, fact, safety, issues, have, been, discovered, one, by, one, over, more, than, a, century, in, the, case, mentioned, in, the, work, of, many, thousands, of, practitioners, and, cannot, be, deduced, by, a, single, individual, over, a, few, decades, a, knowledge, of, the, literature, the, standards, and, custom, in, a, field, is, a, critical, part, of, safety, engineering, a, combination, of, theory, and, track, record, of, practices, is, involved, and, track, record, indicates, some, of, the, areas, of, theory, that, are, relevant, in, the, us, persons, with, a, state, license, in, professional, engineering, in, electrical, engineering, are, expected, to, be, competent, in, this, regard, the, foregoing, notwithstanding, but, most, electrical, engineers, have, no, need, of, the, license, for, their, work, safety, is, often, seen, as, one, of, a, group, of, related, disciplines, quality, reliability, availability, maintainability, and, safety, availability, is, sometimes, not, mentioned, on, the, principle, that, it, is, a, simple, function, of, reliability, and, maintainability, these, issues, tend, to, determine, the, value, of, any, work, and, deficits, in, any, of, these, areas, are, considered, to, result, in, a, cost, beyond, the, cost, of, addressing, the, area, in, the, first, place, good, management, is, then, expected, to, minimize, total, cost, safety, measures, are, activities, and, precautions, taken, to, improve, safety, i, e, reduce, risk, related, to, human, health, common, safety, measures, include, today, there, are, multiple, scientific, journals, focusing, on, safety, research, among, the, most, popular, ones, are, safety, science, and, journal, of, safety, research, the, goal, of, this, research, is, to, identify, understand, and, mitigate, risks, to, human, health, and, well, being, in, various, environments, this, involves, systematically, studying, hazards, analyzing, potential, and, actual, accidents, and, developing, effective, strategies, to, prevent, injuries, and, fatalities, safety, research, aims, to, create, safer, products, systems, and, practices, by, incorporating, scientific, engineering, and, behavioral, insights, ultimately, it, seeks, to, enhance, public, safety, reduce, economic, losses, and, improve, overall, quality, of, life, by, ensuring, that, both, individuals, and, communities, are, better, protected, from, harm, a, number, of, standards, organizations, exist, that, promulgate, safety, standards, these, may, be, voluntary, organizations, or, government, agencies, these, agencies, first, define, the, safety, standards, which, they, publish, in, the, form, of, codes, they, are, also, accreditation, bodies, and, entitle, independent, third, parties, such, as, testing, and, certification, agencies, to, inspect, and, ensure, compliance, to, the, standards, they, defined, for, instance, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, asme, formulated, a, certain, number, of, safety, standards, in, its, boiler, and, pressure, vessel, code, bpvc, and, accredited, t, v, rheinland, to, provide, certification, services, to, guarantee, product, compliance, to, the, defined, safety, regulations, a, major, american, standards, organization, is, the, american, national, standards, institute, ansi, usually, members, of, a, particular, industry, will, voluntarily, form, a, committee, to, study, safety, issues, and, propose, standards, those, standards, are, then, recommended, to, ansi, which, reviews, and, adopts, them, many, government, regulations, require, that, products, sold, or, used, must, comply, with, a, particular, ansi, standard, many, government, agencies, set, safety, standards, for, matters, under, their, jurisdiction, such, as, product, safety, testing, for, the, united, states, is, largely, controlled, by, the, consumer, product, safety, commission, in, addition, workplace, related, products, come, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, which, certifies, independent, testing, companies, as, nationally, recognized, testing, laboratories, nrtl, see, the, european, commission, provides, the, legal, framework, but, the, different, member, states, may, authorize, test, laboratories, to, carry, out, safety, testing, many, countries, have, national, organizations, that, have, accreditation, to, test, and, or, submit, test, reports, for, safety, certification, these, are, typically, referred, to, as, a, notified, or, competent, body
