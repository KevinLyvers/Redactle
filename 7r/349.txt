an, orthography, is, a, set, of, conventions, for, writing, a, language, including, norms, of, spelling, punctuation, word, boundaries, capitalization, hyphenation, and, emphasis, most, national, and, international, languages, have, an, established, writing, system, that, has, undergone, substantial, standardization, thus, exhibiting, less, dialect, variation, than, the, spoken, language, these, processes, can, fossilize, pronunciation, patterns, that, are, no, longer, routinely, observed, in, speech, e, g, would, and, should, they, can, also, reflect, deliberate, efforts, to, introduce, variability, for, the, sake, of, national, identity, as, seen, in, noah, webster, s, efforts, to, introduce, easily, noticeable, differences, between, american, and, british, spelling, e, g, honor, and, honour, orthographic, norms, develop, through, social, and, political, influence, at, various, levels, such, as, encounters, with, print, in, education, the, workplace, and, the, state, some, nations, have, established, language, academies, in, an, attempt, to, regulate, aspects, of, the, national, language, including, its, orthography, such, as, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, france, and, the, royal, spanish, academy, in, spain, no, such, authority, exists, for, most, languages, including, english, some, non, state, organizations, such, as, newspapers, of, record, and, academic, journals, choose, greater, orthographic, homogeneity, by, enforcing, a, particular, style, guide, or, spelling, standard, such, as, oxford, spelling, the, english, word, orthography, dates, from, the, 15th, century, it, comes, from, the, french, orthographie, from, latin, orthographia, which, derives, from, ancient, greek, orth, s, correct, and, gr, phein, to, write, orthography, in, phonetic, writing, systems, is, often, concerned, with, matters, of, spelling, i, e, its, graphemes, relationship, to, the, phonemes, found, in, speech, other, elements, that, may, be, considered, part, of, orthography, include, hyphenation, capitalization, word, boundaries, emphasis, and, punctuation, thus, orthography, describes, or, defines, the, symbols, used, in, writing, and, the, conventions, that, regulate, their, use, most, natural, languages, developed, as, oral, languages, and, writing, systems, have, usually, been, crafted, or, adapted, as, ways, of, representing, the, spoken, language, the, rules, for, doing, this, tend, to, become, standardized, for, a, given, language, leading, to, the, development, of, an, orthography, that, is, generally, considered, correct, in, linguistics, orthography, often, refers, to, any, method, of, writing, a, language, without, judgment, as, to, right, and, wrong, with, a, scientific, understanding, that, orthographic, standardization, exists, on, a, spectrum, of, strength, of, convention, the, original, sense, of, the, word, though, implies, a, dichotomy, of, correct, and, incorrect, and, the, word, is, still, most, often, used, to, refer, specifically, to, a, standardized, prescriptive, manner, of, writing, a, distinction, is, made, between, emic, and, etic, viewpoints, with, the, emic, approach, taking, account, of, language, users, perceptions, of, correctness, and, the, etic, approach, being, purely, descriptive, considering, only, the, empirical, qualities, of, any, system, as, used, orthographic, units, such, as, letters, of, an, alphabet, are, technically, called, graphemes, these, are, a, type, of, abstraction, analogous, to, the, phonemes, of, spoken, languages, different, physical, forms, of, written, symbols, are, considered, to, represent, the, same, grapheme, if, the, differences, between, them, are, not, significant, for, meaning, thus, a, grapheme, can, be, regarded, as, an, abstraction, of, a, collection, of, glyphs, that, are, all, functionally, equivalent, for, example, in, written, english, or, other, languages, using, the, latin, alphabet, there, are, two, different, physical, representations, glyphs, of, the, lowercase, latin, letter, a, a, and, since, however, the, substitution, of, either, of, them, for, the, other, cannot, change, the, meaning, of, a, word, they, are, considered, to, be, allographs, of, the, same, grapheme, which, can, be, written, a, the, italic, and, boldface, forms, are, also, allographic, graphemes, or, sequences, of, them, are, sometimes, placed, between, angle, brackets, as, in, b, or, back, this, distinguishes, them, from, phonemic, transcription, which, is, placed, between, slashes, b, b, k, and, from, phonetic, transcription, which, is, placed, between, square, brackets, the, writing, systems, on, which, orthographies, are, based, can, be, divided, into, a, number, of, types, depending, on, what, type, of, unit, each, symbol, serves, to, represent, the, principal, types, are, logographic, with, symbols, representing, words, or, morphemes, syllabic, with, symbols, representing, syllables, and, alphabetic, with, symbols, roughly, representing, phonemes, many, writing, systems, combine, features, of, more, than, one, of, these, types, and, a, number, of, detailed, classifications, have, been, proposed, japanese, is, an, example, of, a, writing, system, that, can, be, written, using, a, combination, of, logographic, kanji, characters, and, syllabic, hiragana, and, katakana, characters, as, with, many, non, alphabetic, languages, alphabetic, romaji, characters, may, also, be, used, as, needed, orthographies, that, use, alphabets, and, syllabaries, are, based, on, the, principle, that, the, written, symbols, graphemes, correspond, to, units, of, sound, of, the, spoken, language, phonemes, in, the, former, case, and, syllables, in, the, latter, however, in, virtually, all, cases, this, correspondence, is, not, exact, different, languages, orthographies, offer, different, degrees, of, correspondence, between, spelling, and, pronunciation, english, french, danish, and, thai, orthographies, for, example, are, highly, irregular, whereas, the, orthographies, of, languages, such, as, russian, german, and, spanish, represent, pronunciation, much, more, faithfully, although, the, correspondence, between, letters, and, phonemes, is, still, not, exact, finnish, turkish, and, serbo, croatian, orthographies, more, consistently, approximate, the, principle, of, one, letter, per, sound, an, orthography, in, which, the, correspondences, between, spelling, and, pronunciation, are, highly, complex, or, inconsistent, is, called, a, deep, orthography, or, less, formally, the, language, is, said, to, have, irregular, spelling, an, orthography, with, relatively, simple, and, consistent, correspondences, is, called, shallow, and, the, language, has, regular, spelling, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, spelling, and, pronunciation, diverge, is, that, sound, changes, taking, place, in, the, spoken, language, are, not, always, reflected, in, the, orthography, and, hence, spellings, correspond, to, historical, rather, than, present, day, pronunciation, one, consequence, of, this, is, that, many, spellings, come, to, reflect, a, word, s, morphophonemic, structure, rather, than, its, purely, phonemic, structure, for, example, the, english, regular, past, tense, morpheme, is, consistently, spelled, ed, in, spite, of, its, different, pronunciations, in, various, words, this, is, discussed, further, at, phonemic, orthography, morphophonemic, features, the, syllabary, systems, of, japanese, hiragana, and, katakana, are, examples, of, almost, perfectly, shallow, orthographies, the, kana, correspond, with, almost, perfect, consistency, to, the, spoken, syllables, although, with, a, few, exceptions, where, symbols, reflect, historical, or, morphophonemic, features, notably, the, use, of, ji, and, zu, rather, than, ji, and, zu, their, pronunciation, in, standard, tokyo, dialect, when, the, character, is, a, voicing, of, an, underlying, or, see, rendaku, and, the, use, of, and, to, represent, the, sounds, and, as, relics, of, historical, kana, usage, korean, hangul, and, tibetan, scripts, were, also, originally, extremely, shallow, orthographies, but, as, a, representation, of, the, modern, language, those, frequently, also, reflect, morphophonemic, features, for, full, discussion, of, degrees, of, correspondence, between, spelling, and, pronunciation, in, alphabetic, orthographies, including, reasons, why, such, correspondence, may, break, down, see, phonemic, orthography, an, orthography, based, on, a, correspondence, to, phonemes, may, sometimes, lack, characters, to, represent, all, the, phonemic, distinctions, in, the, language, this, is, called, a, defective, orthography, an, example, in, english, is, the, lack, of, any, indication, of, stress, another, is, the, digraph, th, which, represents, two, different, phonemes, as, in, then, and, thin, and, replaced, the, old, letters, and, a, more, systematic, example, is, that, of, abjads, like, the, arabic, and, hebrew, alphabets, in, which, the, short, vowels, are, normally, left, unwritten, and, must, be, inferred, by, the, reader, when, an, alphabet, is, borrowed, from, its, original, language, for, use, with, a, new, language, as, has, been, done, with, the, latin, alphabet, for, many, languages, or, japanese, katakana, for, non, japanese, words, it, often, proves, defective, in, representing, the, new, language, s, phonemes, sometimes, this, problem, is, addressed, by, the, use, of, such, devices, as, digraphs, such, as, sh, and, ch, in, english, where, pairs, of, letters, represent, single, sounds, diacritics, like, the, caron, on, the, letters, and, which, represent, those, same, sounds, in, czech, or, the, addition, of, completely, new, symbols, as, some, languages, have, introduced, the, letter, w, to, the, latin, alphabet, or, of, symbols, from, another, alphabet, such, as, the, rune, in, icelandic, after, the, classical, period, greek, developed, a, lowercase, letter, system, with, diacritics, to, enable, foreigners, to, learn, pronunciation, and, grammatical, features, however, as, pronunciation, of, letters, changed, over, time, the, diacritics, were, reduced, to, representing, the, stressed, syllable, in, modern, greek, typesetting, this, system, has, been, simplified, to, only, have, a, single, accent, to, indicate, which, syllable, is, stressed
