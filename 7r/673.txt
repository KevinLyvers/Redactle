employees, are, referred, to, as, civil, servants, whereas, employees, of, local, authorities, counties, cities, and, similar, administrations, are, generally, referred, to, as, local, government, civil, service, officers, who, are, considered, public, servants, but, not, civil, servants, thus, in, the, uk, a, civil, servant, is, a, public, servant, but, a, public, servant, is, not, necessarily, a, civil, servant, the, study, of, the, civil, service, is, a, part, of, the, field, of, public, service, and, in, some, countries, there, is, no, distinction, between, the, two, staff, members, in, non, departmental, public, bodies, sometimes, called, quangos, may, also, be, classed, as, civil, servants, for, the, purpose, of, statistics, and, possibly, for, their, terms, and, conditions, collectively, a, state, s, civil, servants, form, its, civil, service, or, public, service, the, concept, arose, in, china, and, modern, civil, service, developed, in, britain, in, the, 18th, century, an, international, civil, servant, or, international, staff, member, is, a, civilian, employee, who, is, employed, by, an, intergovernmental, organization, these, international, civil, servants, do, not, resort, under, any, national, legislation, from, which, they, have, immunity, of, jurisdiction, but, are, governed, by, internal, staff, regulations, all, disputes, related, to, international, civil, service, are, brought, before, special, tribunals, created, by, these, international, organizations, such, as, for, instance, the, administrative, tribunal, of, the, ilo, specific, referral, can, be, made, to, the, international, civil, service, commission, icsc, of, the, united, nations, an, independent, expert, body, established, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, its, mandate, is, to, regulate, and, coordinate, the, conditions, of, service, of, staff, in, the, united, nations, common, system, while, promoting, and, maintaining, high, standards, in, the, international, civil, service, the, origin, of, the, modern, meritocratic, civil, service, can, be, traced, back, to, imperial, examination, founded, in, imperial, china, the, imperial, exam, based, on, merit, was, designed, to, select, the, best, administrative, officials, for, the, state, s, bureaucracy, this, system, had, a, huge, influence, on, both, society, and, culture, in, imperial, china, and, was, directly, responsible, for, the, creation, of, a, class, of, scholar, bureaucrats, irrespective, of, their, family, pedigree, originally, appointments, to, the, bureaucracy, were, based, on, the, patronage, of, aristocrats, during, the, han, dynasty, emperor, wu, of, han, established, the, xiaolian, system, of, recommendation, by, superiors, for, appointments, to, office, in, the, areas, of, administration, especially, the, military, appointments, were, based, solely, on, merit, this, was, an, early, form, of, the, imperial, examinations, transitioning, from, inheritance, and, patronage, to, merit, in, which, local, officials, would, select, candidates, to, take, part, in, an, examination, of, the, confucian, classics, after, the, fall, of, the, han, dynasty, the, chinese, bureaucracy, regressed, into, a, semi, merit, system, known, as, the, nine, rank, system, this, system, was, reversed, during, the, short, lived, sui, dynasty, 581, 618, which, initiated, a, civil, service, bureaucracy, recruited, through, written, examinations, and, recommendation, the, first, civil, service, examination, system, was, established, by, emperor, wen, of, sui, emperor, yang, of, sui, established, a, new, category, of, recommended, candidates, for, the, mandarinate, in, ad, 605, the, following, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, adopted, the, same, measures, for, drafting, officials, and, decreasingly, relied, on, aristocratic, recommendations, and, more, and, more, on, promotion, based, on, the, results, of, written, examinations, the, structure, of, the, examination, system, was, extensively, expanded, during, the, reign, of, wu, zetian, the, system, reached, its, apogee, during, the, song, dynasty, in, theory, the, chinese, civil, service, system, provided, one, of, the, main, avenues, for, social, mobility, in, chinese, society, although, in, practice, due, to, the, time, consuming, nature, of, the, study, the, examination, was, generally, only, taken, by, sons, of, the, landed, gentry, the, examination, tested, the, candidate, s, memorization, of, the, nine, classics, of, confucianism, and, his, ability, to, compose, poetry, using, fixed, and, traditional, forms, and, calligraphy, it, was, ideally, suited, to, literary, candidates, thus, toward, the, end, of, the, ming, dynasty, the, system, attracted, the, candidature, of, tang, xianzu, 1550, 1616, tang, at, 14, passed, the, imperial, examination, at, the, county, level, and, at, 21, he, did, so, at, the, provincial, level, but, not, until, he, was, 34, did, he, pass, at, the, national, level, however, he, had, already, become, a, well, known, poet, at, age, 12, and, among, other, things, he, went, on, to, such, distinction, as, a, profound, literati, and, dramatist, that, it, would, not, be, far, fetched, to, regard, him, as, china, s, answer, to, william, shakespeare, in, the, late, 19th, century, however, the, system, increasingly, engendered, internal, dissatisfaction, and, was, criticized, as, not, reflecting, candidates, ability, to, govern, well, and, for, giving, undue, weight, to, style, over, content, and, originality, of, thought, indeed, long, before, its, abandonment, the, notion, of, the, imperial, system, as, a, route, to, social, mobility, was, somewhat, mythical, in, tang, s, magnum, opus, the, peony, pavilion, sc, 13, leaving, home, the, male, lead, liu, mengmei, laments, after, twenty, years, of, studies, i, still, have, no, hope, of, getting, into, office, and, on, this, point, tang, may, be, speaking, through, liu, as, his, alter, ego, the, system, was, finally, abolished, by, the, qing, government, in, 1905, as, part, of, the, new, policies, reform, package, the, chinese, system, was, often, admired, by, european, commentators, from, the, 16th, century, onward, however, the, chinese, imperial, examination, system, was, hardly, universally, admired, by, all, europeans, who, knew, of, it, in, a, debate, in, the, unelected, chamber, of, the, uk, parliament, on, march, 13, 1854, john, browne, pointed, out, that, the, only, precedent, for, appointing, civil, servants, by, literary, exams, was, that, of, the, chinese, government, in, the, 18th, century, in, response, to, economic, changes, and, the, growth, of, the, british, empire, the, bureaucracy, of, institutions, such, as, the, office, of, works, and, the, navy, board, greatly, expanded, each, had, its, own, system, but, in, general, staff, were, appointed, through, patronage, or, outright, purchase, by, the, 19th, century, it, became, increasingly, clear, that, these, arrangements, were, falling, short, the, origins, of, the, british, civil, service, are, better, known, during, the, eighteenth, century, a, number, of, englishmen, wrote, in, praise, of, the, chinese, examination, system, some, of, them, going, so, far, as, to, urge, the, adoption, for, england, of, something, similar, the, first, concrete, step, in, this, direction, was, taken, by, the, british, east, india, company, in, 1806, in, that, year, the, honourable, east, india, company, established, a, college, the, east, india, company, college, near, london, to, train, and, examine, administrators, of, the, company, s, territories, in, india, the, proposal, for, establishing, this, college, came, significantly, from, members, of, the, east, india, company, s, trading, post, in, canton, china, examinations, for, the, indian, civil, service, a, term, coined, by, the, company, were, introduced, in, 1829, british, efforts, at, reform, were, influenced, by, the, imperial, examinations, system, and, meritocratic, system, of, china, thomas, taylor, meadows, britain, s, consul, in, guangzhou, china, argued, in, his, desultory, notes, on, the, government, and, people, of, china, published, in, 1847, that, the, long, duration, of, the, chinese, empire, is, solely, and, altogether, owing, to, the, good, government, which, consists, in, the, advancement, of, men, of, talent, and, merit, only, and, that, the, british, must, reform, their, civil, service, by, making, the, institution, meritocratic, on, the, other, hand, john, browne, in, the, 1854, debate, mentioned, above, argued, that, elegant, writing, had, become, an, end, in, itself, and, the, stultifying, effect, of, this, on, the, chinese, civil, service, had, contributed, in, no, small, measure, to, china, s, failure, to, develop, its, early, lead, over, western, civilisations, coolican, p, 107, in, 1853, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, william, gladstone, commissioned, sir, stafford, northcote, and, charles, trevelyan, to, look, into, the, operation, and, organisation, of, the, civil, service, influenced, by, the, chinese, imperial, examinations, the, northcote, trevelyan, report, of, 1854, made, four, principal, recommendations, that, recruitment, should, be, on, the, basis, of, merit, determined, through, competitive, examination, that, candidates, should, have, a, solid, general, education, to, enable, inter, departmental, transfers, that, recruits, should, be, graded, into, a, hierarchy, and, that, promotion, should, be, through, achievement, rather, than, preferment, patronage, or, purchase, it, also, recommended, a, clear, division, between, staff, responsible, for, routine, mechanical, work, and, those, engaged, in, policy, formulation, and, implementation, in, an, administrative, class, the, report, was, well, timed, because, bureaucratic, chaos, during, the, crimean, war, was, causing, a, clamour, for, the, change, the, report, s, conclusions, were, immediately, implemented, and, a, permanent, unified, and, politically, neutral, civil, service, was, introduced, as, her, majesty, s, civil, service, a, civil, service, commission, was, also, set, up, in, 1855, to, oversee, open, recruitment, and, end, patronage, and, most, of, the, other, northcote, trevelyan, recommendations, were, implemented, over, some, years, the, same, model, the, imperial, civil, service, was, implemented, in, british, india, from, 1858, after, the, demise, of, the, east, india, company, s, rule, in, india, through, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, which, came, close, to, toppling, british, rule, in, the, country, the, northcote, trevelyan, model, remained, essentially, stable, for, a, hundred, years, this, was, a, tribute, to, its, success, in, removing, corruption, delivering, public, services, even, under, the, stress, of, two, world, wars, and, responding, effectively, to, political, change, it, also, had, a, great, international, influence, and, was, adapted, by, members, of, the, commonwealth, the, pendleton, civil, service, reform, act, established, a, modern, civil, service, in, the, united, states, and, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, almost, all, western, governments, had, implemented, similar, reforms, brazil, started, to, move, away, from, a, patronage, based, public, service, starting, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, but, written, tests, and, merit, only, became, the, norm, towards, the, end, of, the, 1930s, as, a, result, from, reforms, introduced, during, get, lio,

practiced, on, a, much, smaller, scale, in, comparison, to, the, stronger, centralized, bureaucracy, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, in, response, to, the, regional, military, rule, of, jiedushi, and, the, loss, of, civil, authority, during, the, late, tang, period, and, five, dynasties, 907, 960, the, song, emperors, were, eager, to, implement, a, system, where, civil, officials, would, owe, their, social, prestige, to, the, central, court, and, gain, their, salaries, strictly, from, the, central, government, this, ideal, was, not, fully, achieved, since, many, scholar, officials, were, affluent, landowners, and, were, engaged, in, many, anonymous, business, affairs, in, an, age, of, economic, revolution, in, china, nonetheless, gaining, a, degree, through, three, levels, of, examination, prefectural, exams, provincial, exams, and, the, prestigious, palace, exams, was, a, far, more, desirable, goal, in, society, than, becoming, a, merchant, this, was, because, the, mercantile, class, was, traditionally, regarded, with, some, disdain, by, the, scholar, official, class, this, class, of, state, bureaucrats, in, the, song, period, were, far, less, aristocratic, than, their, tang, predecessors, the, examinations, were, carefully, structured, in, order, to, ensure, that, people, of, lesser, means, than, what, was, available, to, candidates, born, into, wealthy, landowning, families, were, given, a, greater, chance, to, pass, the, exams, and, obtain, an, official, degree, this, included, the, employment, of, a, bureau, of, copyists, who, would, rewrite, all, of, the, candidates, exams, in, order, to, mask, their, handwriting, and, thus, prevent, favoritism, by, graders, of, the, exams, who, might, otherwise, recognize, a, candidate, s, handwriting, the, advent, of, widespread, printing, in, the, song, period, allowed, many, more, examination, candidates, access, to, the, confucian, texts, whose, mastery, was, required, for, passing, the, exams, hong, kong, and, macau, have, separate, civil, service, systems, in, india, civil, servants, are, selected, as, per, the, constitution, of, india, civil, servants, serve, at, the,
