the, greek, alphabet, has, been, used, to, write, the, greek, language, since, the, late, 9th, or, early, 8th, century, bc, it, is, derived, from, the, earlier, phoenician, alphabet, and, was, the, earliest, known, alphabetic, script, to, have, distinct, letters, for, vowels, as, well, as, consonants, in, archaic, and, early, classical, times, the, greek, alphabet, existed, in, many, local, variants, but, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, the, euclidean, alphabet, with, 24, letters, ordered, from, alpha, to, omega, had, become, standard, and, it, is, this, version, that, is, still, used, for, greek, writing, today, the, uppercase, and, lowercase, forms, of, the, 24, letters, are, the, greek, alphabet, is, the, ancestor, of, the, latin, and, cyrillic, scripts, like, latin, and, cyrillic, greek, originally, had, only, a, single, form, of, each, letter, it, developed, the, letter, case, distinction, between, uppercase, and, lowercase, in, parallel, with, latin, during, the, modern, era, sound, values, and, conventional, transcriptions, for, some, of, the, letters, differ, between, ancient, and, modern, greek, usage, because, the, pronunciation, of, greek, has, changed, significantly, between, the, 5th, century, bc, and, today, modern, and, ancient, greek, also, use, different, diacritics, with, modern, greek, keeping, only, the, stress, accent, acute, and, the, diaeresis, apart, from, its, use, in, writing, the, greek, language, in, both, its, ancient, and, its, modern, forms, the, greek, alphabet, today, also, serves, as, a, source, of, international, technical, symbols, and, labels, in, many, domains, of, mathematics, science, and, other, fields, in, both, ancient, and, modern, greek, the, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, have, fairly, stable, and, consistent, symbol, to, sound, mappings, making, pronunciation, of, words, largely, predictable, ancient, greek, spelling, was, generally, near, phonemic, for, a, number, of, letters, sound, values, differ, considerably, between, ancient, and, modern, greek, because, their, pronunciation, has, followed, a, set, of, systematic, phonological, shifts, that, affected, the, language, in, its, post, classical, stages, before, e, i, similar, to, y, as, in, english, y, ellow, ng, as, in, english, lo, ng, as, in, spanish, a, o, as, in, french, t, similar, to, ay, as, in, english, overl, ay, but, without, pronouncing, y, ai, as, in, english, f, ai, ry, as, in, french, t, te, before, e, i, q, as, in, french, q, ui, as, in, french, t, t, r, as, in, spanish, ca, r, o, before, e, i, h, as, in, english, h, ue, among, consonant, letters, all, letters, that, denoted, voiced, plosive, consonants, b, d, g, and, aspirated, plosives, p, t, k, in, ancient, greek, stand, for, corresponding, fricative, sounds, in, modern, greek, the, correspondences, are, as, follows, among, the, vowel, symbols, modern, greek, sound, values, reflect, the, radical, simplification, of, the, vowel, system, of, post, classical, greek, merging, multiple, formerly, distinct, vowel, phonemes, into, a, much, smaller, number, this, leads, to, several, groups, of, vowel, letters, denoting, identical, sounds, today, modern, greek, orthography, remains, true, to, the, historical, spellings, in, most, of, these, cases, as, a, consequence, the, spellings, of, words, in, modern, greek, are, often, not, predictable, from, the, pronunciation, alone, while, the, reverse, mapping, from, spelling, to, pronunciation, is, usually, regular, and, predictable, the, following, vowel, letters, and, digraphs, are, involved, in, the, mergers, modern, greek, speakers, typically, use, the, same, modern, symbol, sound, mappings, in, reading, greek, of, all, historical, stages, in, other, countries, students, of, ancient, greek, may, use, a, variety, of, conventional, approximations, of, the, historical, sound, system, in, pronouncing, ancient, greek, several, letter, combinations, have, special, conventional, sound, values, different, from, those, of, their, single, components, among, them, are, several, digraphs, of, vowel, letters, that, formerly, represented, diphthongs, but, are, now, monophthongized, in, addition, to, the, four, mentioned, above, pronounced, i, and, pronounced, e, there, is, also, and, pronounced, u, the, ancient, greek, diphthongs, and, are, pronounced, and, in, modern, greek, in, some, environments, they, are, devoiced, to, and, the, modern, greek, consonant, combinations, and, stand, for, and, or, and, stands, for, and, stands, for, in, addition, both, in, ancient, and, modern, greek, the, letter, before, another, velar, consonant, stands, for, the, velar, nasal, thus, and, are, pronounced, like, english, ng, like, in, the, word, finger, not, like, in, the, word, thing, in, analogy, to, and, is, also, used, to, stand, for, there, are, also, the, combinations, and, in, the, polytonic, orthography, traditionally, used, for, ancient, greek, and, katharevousa, the, stressed, vowel, of, each, word, carries, one, of, three, accent, marks, either, the, acute, accent, the, grave, accent, or, the, circumflex, accent, or, these, signs, were, originally, designed, to, mark, different, forms, of, the, phonological, pitch, accent, in, ancient, greek, by, the, time, their, use, became, conventional, and, obligatory, in, greek, writing, in, late, antiquity, pitch, accent, was, evolving, into, a, single, stress, accent, and, thus, the, three, signs, have, not, corresponded, to, a, phonological, distinction, in, actual, speech, ever, since, in, addition, to, the, accent, marks, every, word, initial, vowel, must, carry, either, of, two, so, called, breathing, marks, the, rough, breathing, marking, an, h, sound, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, or, the, smooth, breathing, marking, its, absence, the, letter, rho, although, not, a, vowel, also, carries, rough, breathing, in, a, word, initial, position, if, a, rho, was, geminated, within, a, word, the, first, always, had, the, smooth, breathing, and, the, second, the, rough, breathing, leading, to, the, transliteration, rrh, the, vowel, letters, carry, an, additional, diacritic, in, certain, words, the, so, called, iota, subscript, which, has, the, shape, of, a, small, vertical, stroke, or, a, miniature, below, the, letter, this, iota, represents, the, former, offglide, of, what, were, originally, long, diphthongs, i, e, a, i, i, i, which, became, monophthongized, during, antiquity, another, diacritic, used, in, greek, is, the, diaeresis, indicating, a, hiatus, this, system, of, diacritics, was, first, developed, by, the, scholar, aristophanes, of, byzantium, c, 257, c, 185, 180, bc, who, worked, at, the, musaeum, in, alexandria, during, the, third, century, bc, aristophanes, of, byzantium, also, was, the, first, to, divide, poems, into, lines, rather, than, writing, them, like, prose, and, also, introduced, a, series, of, signs, for, textual, criticism, in, 1982, a, new, simplified, orthography, known, as, monotonic, was, adopted, for, official, use, in, modern, greek, by, the, greek, state, it, uses, only, a, single, accent, mark, the, acute, also, known, in, this, context, as, tonos, i, e, simply, accent, marking, the, stressed, syllable, of, polysyllabic, words, and, occasionally, the, diaeresis, to, distinguish, diphthongal, from, digraph, readings, in, pairs, of, vowel, letters, making, this, monotonic, system, very, similar, to, the, accent, mark, system, used, in, spanish, the, polytonic, system, is, still, conventionally, used, for, writing, ancient, greek, while, in, some, book, printing, and, generally, in, the, usage, of, conservative, writers, it, can, still, also, be, found, in, use, for, modern, greek, although, it, is, not, a, diacritic, the, comma, has, a, similar, function, as, a, silent, letter, in, a, handful, of, greek, words, principally, distinguishing, ti, whatever, from, ti, that, there, are, many, different, methods, of, rendering, greek, text, or, greek, names, in, the, latin, script, the, form, in, which, classical, greek, names, are, conventionally, rendered, in, english, goes, back, to, the, way, greek, loanwords, were, incorporated, into, latin, in, antiquity, in, this, system, is, replaced, with, c, the, diphthongs, and, are, rendered, as, ae, and, oe, or, and, and, are, simplified, to, i, and, u, smooth, breathing, marks, are, usually, ignored, and, rough, breathing, marks, are, usually, rendered, as, the, letter, h, in, modern, scholarly, transliteration, of, ancient, greek, will, usually, be, rendered, as, k, and, the, vowel, combinations, as, ai, oi, ei, ou, the, letters, and, are, generally, rendered, as, th, and, ph, as, either, ch, or, kh, and, word, initial, as, rh, transcription, conventions, for, modern, greek, differ, widely, depending, on, their, purpose, on, how, close, they, stay, to, the, conventional, letter, correspondences, of, ancient, greek, based, transcription, systems, and, to, what, degree, they, attempt, either, an, exact, letter, by, letter, transliteration, or, rather, a, phonetically, based, transcription, standardized, formal, transcription, systems, have, been, defined, by, the, international, organization, for, standardization, as, iso, 843, by, the, united, nations, group, of, experts, on, geographical, names, by, the, library, of, congress, and, others, during, the, mycenaean, period, from, around, the, sixteenth, century, to, the, twelfth, century, bc, linear, b, was, used, to, write, the, earliest, attested, form, of, the, greek, language, known, as, mycenaean, greek, this, writing, system, unrelated, to, the, greek, alphabet, last, appeared, in, the, thirteenth, century, bc, in, the, late, ninth, century, bc, or, early, eighth, century, bc, the, greek, alphabet, emerged, the, period, between, the, use, of, the, two, writing, systems, during, which, no, greek, texts, are, attested, is, known, as, the, greek, dark, ages, the, greeks, adopted, the, alphabet, from, the, earlier, phoenician, alphabet, one, of, the, closely, related, scripts, used, for, the, west, semitic, languages, calling, it, phoenician, letters, however, the, phoenician, alphabet, is, limited, to, consonants, when, it, was, adopted, for, writing, greek, certain, consonants, were, adapted, to, express, vowels, the, use, of, both, vowels, and, consonants, makes, greek, the, first, alphabet, in, the, narrow, sense, as, distinguished, from, the, abjads, used, in, semitic, languages, which, have, letters, only, for, consonants, greek, initially, took, over, all, of, the, 22, letters, of, phoenician, five, were, reassigned, to, denote, vowel, sounds, the, glide, consonants, j, yodh, and, w, waw, were, used, for, iota, and, upsilon, the, glottal, stop, consonant, aleph, was, used, for, alpha, the, pharyngeal, ayin, was, turned, into, omicron, and, the, letter, for, h, he, was, turned, into, epsilon, a, doublet, of, waw, was, also, borrowed, as, a, consonant, for, digamma, in, addition, the, phoenician, letter, for, the, emphatic, glottal, heth, was, borrowed, in, two, different, functions, by, different, dialects, of, greek, as, a, letter, for, h, heta, by, those, dialects, that, had, such, a, sound, and, as, an, additional, vowel, letter, for, the, long, eta, by, those, dialects, that, lacked, the, consonant, eventually, a, seventh, vowel, letter, for, the, long, omega, was, introduced, greek, also, introduced, three, new, consonant, letters, for, its, aspirated, plosive, sounds, and, consonant, clusters, phi, for, p, chi, for, k, and, psi, for, ps, in, western, greek, variants, was, instead, used, for, ks, and, for, k, the, origin, of, these, letters, is, a, matter, of, some, debate, three, of, the, original, phoenician, letters, dropped, out, of, use, before, the, alphabet, took, its, classical, shape, the, letter, san, which, had, been, in, competition, with, sigma, denoting, the, same, phoneme, s, the, letter, qoppa, which, was, redundant, with, kappa, for, k, and, digamma, whose, sound, value, w, dropped, out, of, the, spoken, language, before, or, during, the, classical, period, greek, was, originally, written, predominantly, from, right, to, left, just, like, phoenician, but, scribes, could, freely, alternate, between, directions, for, a, time, a, writing, style, with, alternating, right, to, left, and, left, to, right, lines, called, boustrophedon, literally, ox, turning, after, the, manner, of, an, ox, ploughing, a, field, was, common, until, in, the, classical, period, the, left, to, right, writing, direction, became, the, norm, individual, letter, shapes, were, mirrored, depending, on, the, writing, direction, of, the, current, line, there, were, initially, numerous, local, epichoric, variants, of, the, greek, alphabet, which, differed, in, the, use, and, non, use, of, the, additional, vowel, and, consonant, symbols, and, several, other, features, epichoric, alphabets, are, commonly, divided, into, four, major, types, according, to, their, different, treatments, of, additional, consonant, letters, for, the, aspirated, consonants, p, k, and, consonant, clusters, ks, ps, of, greek, these, four, types, are, often, conventionally, labelled, as, green, red, light, blue, and, dark, blue, types, based, on, a, colour, coded, map, in, a, seminal, 19th, century, work, on, the, topic, studien, zur, geschichte, des, griechischen, alphabets, by, adolf, kirchhoff, 1867, the, green, or, southern, type, is, the, most, archaic, and, closest, to, the, phoenician, the, red, or, western, type, is, the, one, that, was, later, transmitted, to, the, west, and, became, the, ancestor, of, the, latin, alphabet, and, bears, some, crucial, features, characteristic, of, that, later, development, the, blue, or, eastern, type, is, the, one, from, which, the, later, standard, greek, alphabet, emerged, athens, used, a, local, form, of, the, light, blue, alphabet, type, until, the, end, of, the, fifth, century, bc, which, lacked, the, letters, and, as, well, as, the, vowel, symbols, and, in, the, old, attic, alphabet, stood, for, ks, and, for, ps, was, used, for, all, three, sounds, e, e, correspondin, to, classical, and, was, used, for, all, of, o, o, corresponding, to, classical, the, letter, heta, was, used, for, the, consonant, h, some, variant, local, letter, forms, were, also, characteristic, of, athenian, writing, some, of, which, were, shared, with, the, neighboring, but, otherwise, red, alphabet, of, euboia, a, form, of, that, resembled, a, latin, l, and, a, form, of, that, resembled, a, latin, s, upsilon, is, also, derived, from, waw, the, classical, twenty, four, letter, alphabet, that, is, now, used, to, represent, the, greek, language, was, originally, the, local, alphabet, of, ionia, by, the, late, fifth, century, bc, it, was, commonly, used, by, many, athenians, in, c, 403, bc, at, the, suggestion, of, the, archon, eucleides, the, athenian, assembly, formally, abandoned, the, old, attic, alphabet, and, adopted, the, ionian, alphabet, as, part, of, the, democratic, reforms, after, the, overthrow, of, the, thirty, tyrants, because, of, eucleides, s, role, in, suggesting, the, idea, to, adopt, the, ionian, alphabet, the, standard, twenty, four, letter, greek, alphabet, is, sometimes, known, as, the, eucleidean, alphabet, roughly, thirty, years, later, the, eucleidean, alphabet, was, adopted, in, boeotia, and, it, may, have, been, adopted, a, few, years, previously, in, macedonia, by, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, bc, it, had, displaced, local, alphabets, across, the, greek, speaking, world, to, become, the, standard, form, of, the, greek, alphabet, when, the, greeks, adopted, the, phoenician, alphabet, they, took, over, not, only, the, letter, shapes, and, sound, values, but, also, the, names, by, which, the, sequence, of, the, alphabet, could, be, recited, and, memorized, in, phoenician, each, letter, name, was, a, word, that, began, with, the, sound, represented, by, that, letter, thus, aleph, the, word, for, ox, was, used, as, the, name, for, the, glottal, stop, bet, or, house, for, the, b, sound, and, so, on, when, the, letters, were, adopted, by, the, greeks, most, of, the, phoenician, names, were, maintained, or, modified, slightly, to, fit, greek, phonology, thus, aleph, bet, gimel, became, alpha, beta, gamma, the, greek, names, of, the, following, letters, are, more, or, less, straightforward, continuations, of, their, phoenician, antecedents, between, ancient, and, modern, greek, they, have, remained, largely, unchanged, except, that, their, pronunciation, has, followed, regular, sound, changes, along, with, other, words, for, instance, in, the, name, of, beta, ancient, b, regularly, changed, to, modern, v, and, ancient, to, modern, i, resulting, in, the, modern, pronunciation, vita, the, name, of, lambda, is, attested, in, early, sources, as, besides, in, modern, greek, the, spelling, is, often, reflecting, pronunciation, similarly, iota, is, sometimes, spelled, in, modern, greek, is, conventionally, transcribed, word, initially, and, intervocalically, before, back, vowels, and, a, in, the, tables, below, the, greek, names, of, all, letters, are, given, in, their, traditional, polytonic, spelling, in, modern, practice, like, with, all, other, words, they, are, usually, spelled, in, the, simplified, monotonic, system, in, the, cases, of, the, three, historical, sibilant, letters, below, the, correspondence, between, phoenician, and, ancient, greek, is, less, clear, with, apparent, mismatches, both, in, letter, names, and, sound, values, the, early, history, of, these, letters, and, the, fourth, sibilant, letter, obsolete, san, has, been, a, matter, of, some, debate, here, too, the, changes, in, the, pronunciation, of, the, letter, names, between, ancient, and, modern, greek, are, regular, in, the, following, group, of, consonant, letters, the, older, forms, of, the, names, in, ancient, greek, were, spelled, with, indicating, an, original, pronunciation, with, in, modern, greek, these, names, are, spelled, with, the, following, group, of, vowel, letters, were, originally, called, simply, by, their, sound, values, as, long, vowels, and, their, modern, names, contain, adjectival, qualifiers, that, were, added, during, the, byzantine, period, to, distinguish, between, letters, that, had, become, confusable, thus, the, letters, and, pronounced, identically, by, this, time, were, called, o, mikron, small, o, and, o, mega, big, o, the, letter, was, called, e, psilon, plain, e, to, distinguish, it, from, the, identically, pronounced, digraph, while, similarly, which, at, this, time, was, pronounced, was, called, y, psilon, plain, y, to, distinguish, it, from, the, identically, pronounced, digraph, some, dialects, of, the, aegean, and, cypriot, have, retained, long, consonants, and, pronounce, and, also, has, come, to, be, pronounced, in, cypriot, like, latin, and, other, alphabetic, scripts, greek, originally, had, only, a, single, form, of, each, letter, without, a, distinction, between, uppercase, and, lowercase, this, distinction, is, an, innovation, of, the, modern, era, drawing, on, different, lines, of, development, of, the, letter, shapes, in, earlier, handwriting, the, oldest, forms, of, the, letters, in, antiquity, are, majuscule, forms, besides, the, upright, straight, inscriptional, forms, capitals, found, in, stone, carvings, or, incised, pottery, more, fluent, writing, styles, adapted, for, handwriting, on, soft, materials, were, also, developed, during, antiquity, such, handwriting, has, been, preserved, especially, from, papyrus, manuscripts, in, egypt, since, the, hellenistic, period, ancient, handwriting, developed, two, distinct, styles, uncial, writing, with, carefully, drawn, rounded, block, letters, of, about, equal, size, used, as, a, book, hand, for, carefully, produced, literary, and, religious, manuscripts, and, cursive, writing, used, for, everyday, purposes, the, cursive, forms, approached, the, style, of, lowercase, letter, forms, with, ascenders, and, descenders, as, well, as, many, connecting, lines, and, ligatures, between, letters, in, the, ninth, and, tenth, century, uncial, book, hands, were, replaced, with, a, new, more, compact, writing, style, with, letter, forms, partly, adapted, from, the, earlier, cursive, this, minuscule, style, remained, the, dominant, form, of, handwritten, greek, into, the, modern, era, during, the, renaissance, western, printers, adopted, the, minuscule, letter, forms, as, lowercase, printed, typefaces, while, modeling, uppercase, letters, on, the, ancient, inscriptional, forms, the, orthographic, practice, of, using, the, letter, case, distinction, for, marking, proper, names, titles, etc, developed, in, parallel, to, the, practice, in, latin, and, other, western, languages, the, greek, alphabet, was, the, model, for, various, others, the, armenian, and, georgian, alphabets, are, almost, certainly, modeled, on, the, greek, alphabet, but, their, graphic, forms, are, quite, different, apart, from, the, daughter, alphabets, listed, above, which, were, adapted, from, greek, but, developed, into, separate, writing, systems, the, greek, alphabet, has, also, been, adopted, at, various, times, and, in, various, places, to, write, other, languages, for, some, of, them, additional, letters, were, introduced, greek, symbols, are, used, as, symbols, in, mathematics, physics, and, other, sciences, many, symbols, have, traditional, uses, such, as, lower, case, epsilon, for, an, arbitrarily, small, positive, number, lower, case, pi, for, the, ratio, of, the, circumference, of, a, circle, to, its, diameter, capital, sigma, for, summation, and, lower, case, sigma, for, standard, deviation, for, many, years, the, greek, alphabet, was, used, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, for, naming, north, atlantic, hurricanes, if, a, season, was, so, active, that, it, exhausted, the, regular, list, of, storm, names, this, happened, during, the, 2005, season, when, alpha, through, zeta, were, used, and, the, 2020, season, when, alpha, through, iota, were, used, after, which, the, practice, was, discontinued, in, may, 2021, the, world, health, organization, announced, that, the, variants, of, sars, cov, 2, of, the, virus, would, be, named, using, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, to, avoid, stigma, and, simplify, communications, for, non, scientific, audiences, greek, letters, are, used, to, denote, the, brighter, stars, within, each, of, the, eighty, eight, constellations, in, most, constellations, the, brightest, star, is, designated, alpha, and, the, next, brightest, beta, etc, for, example, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, of, centaurus, is, known, as, alpha, centauri, for, historical, reasons, the, greek, designations, of, some, constellations, begin, with, a, lower, ranked, letter, several, greek, letters, are, used, as, phonetic, symbols, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, several, of, them, denote, fricative, consonants, the, rest, stand, for, variants, of, vowel, sounds, the, glyph, shapes, used, for, these, letters, in, specialized, phonetic, fonts, is, sometimes, slightly, different, from, the, conventional, shapes, in, greek, typography, proper, with, glyphs, typically, being, more, upright, and, using, serifs, to, make, them, conform, more, with, the, typographical, character, of, other, latin, based, letters, in, the, phonetic, alphabet, nevertheless, in, the, unicode, encoding, standard, the, following, three, phonetic, symbols, are, considered, the, same, characters, as, the, corresponding, greek, letters, proper, on, the, other, hand, the, following, phonetic, letters, have, unicode, representations, separate, from, their, greek, alphabetic, use, either, because, their, conventional, typographic, shape, is, too, different, from, the, original, or, because, they, also, have, secondary, uses, as, regular, alphabetic, characters, in, some, latin, based, alphabets, including, separate, latin, uppercase, letters, distinct, from, the, greek, ones, the, symbol, in, americanist, phonetic, notation, for, the, voiceless, alveolar, lateral, fricative, is, the, greek, letter, lambda, but, in, the, ipa, the, ipa, symbol, for, the, palatal, lateral, approximant, is, which, looks, similar, to, lambda, but, is, actually, an, inverted, lowercase, y, greek, letters, were, also, used, to, write, numbers, in, the, classical, ionian, system, the, first, nine, letters, of, the, alphabet, stood, for, the, numbers, from, 1, to, 9, the, next, nine, letters, stood, for, the, multiples, of, 10, from, 10, to, 90, and, the, next, nine, letters, stood, for, the, multiples, of, 100, from, 100, to, 900, for, this, purpose, in, addition, to, the, 24, letters, which, by, that, time, made, up, the, standard, alphabet, three, otherwise, obsolete, letters, were, retained, or, revived, digamma, for, 6, koppa, for, 90, and, a, rare, ionian, letter, for, today, called, sampi, for, 900, this, system, has, remained, in, use, in, greek, up, to, the, present, day, although, today, it, is, only, employed, for, limited, purposes, such, as, enumerating, chapters, in, a, book, similar, to, the, way, roman, numerals, are, used, in, english, the, three, extra, symbols, are, today, written, as, and, to, mark, a, letter, as, a, numeral, sign, a, small, stroke, called, keraia, is, added, to, the, right, of, it, in, north, america, many, college, fraternities, and, sororities, are, named, with, combinations, of, greek, letters, and, are, hence, also, known, as, greek, letter, organizations, this, naming, tradition, was, initiated, by, the, foundation, of, the, phi, beta, kappa, society, at, the, college, of, william, and, mary, in, 1776, the, name, of, this, fraternal, organization, is, an, acronym, for, the, ancient, greek, phrase, philosophia, biou, kybern, t, s, which, means, love, of, wisdom, the, guide, of, life, and, serves, as, the, organization, s, motto, sometimes, early, fraternal, organizations, were, known, by, their, greek, letter, names, because, the, mottos, that, these, names, stood, for, were, secret, and, revealed, only, to, members, of, the, fraternity, different, chapters, within, the, same, fraternity, are, almost, always, with, a, handful, of, exceptions, designated, using, greek, letters, as, serial, numbers, the, founding, chapter, of, each, organization, is, its, a, chapter, as, an, organization, expands, it, establishes, a, b, chapter, a, chapter, and, so, on, and, so, forth, in, an, organization, that, expands, to, more, than, 24, chapters, the, chapter, after, chapter, is, aa, chapter, followed, by, ab, chapter, etc, each, of, these, is, still, a, chapter, letter, albeit, a, double, digit, letter, just, as, 10, through, 99, are, double, digit, numbers, the, roman, alphabet, has, a, similar, extended, form, with, such, double, digit, letters, when, necessary, but, it, is, used, for, columns, in, a, table, or, chart, rather, than, chapters, of, an, organization, some, letters, can, occur, in, variant, shapes, mostly, inherited, from, medieval, minuscule, handwriting, while, their, use, in, normal, typography, of, greek, is, purely, a, matter, of, font, styles, some, such, variants, have, been, given, separate, encodings, in, unicode, for, computer, usage, a, variety, of, encodings, have, been, used, for, greek, online, many, of, them, documented, in, rfc, 1947, the, two, principal, ones, still, used, today, are, iso, iec, 8859, 7, and, unicode, iso, 8859, 7, supports, only, the, monotonic, orthography, unicode, supports, both, the, monotonic, and, polytonic, orthographies, for, the, range, a0, ff, hex, it, follows, the, unicode, range, 370, 3cf, see, below, except, that, some, symbols, like, etc, are, used, where, unicode, has, unused, locations, like, all, iso, 8859, encodings, it, is, equal, to, ascii, for, 00, 7f, hex, unicode, supports, polytonic, orthography, well, enough, for, ordinary, continuous, text, in, modern, and, ancient, greek, and, even, many, archaic, forms, for, epigraphy, with, the, use, of, combining, characters, unicode, also, supports, greek, philology, and, dialectology, and, various, other, specialized, requirements, most, current, text, rendering, engines, do, not, render, diacritics, well, so, though, alpha, with, macron, and, acute, can, be, represented, as, u, 03b1, u, 0304, u, 0301, this, rarely, renders, well, there, are, two, main, blocks, of, greek, characters, in, unicode, the, first, is, greek, and, coptic, u, 0370, to, u, 03ff, this, block, is, based, on, iso, 8859, 7, and, is, sufficient, to, write, modern, greek, there, are, also, some, archaic, letters, and, greek, based, technical, symbols, this, block, also, supports, the, coptic, alphabet, formerly, most, coptic, letters, shared, codepoints, with, similar, looking, greek, letters, but, in, many, scholarly, works, both, scripts, occur, with, quite, different, letter, shapes, so, as, of, unicode, 4, 1, coptic, and, greek, were, disunified, those, coptic, letters, with, no, greek, equivalents, still, remain, in, this, block, u, 03e2, to, u, 03ef, to, write, polytonic, greek, one, may, use, combining, diacritical, marks, or, the, precomposed, characters, in, the, greek, extended, block, u, 1f00, to, u, 1fff, combining, and, spacing, letter, free, diacritical, marks, pertaining, to, greek, language, ibm, code, pages, 437, 860, 861, 862, 863, and, 865, contain, the, letters, plus, as, an, alternative, interpretation, for
