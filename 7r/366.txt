the, slavic, languages, also, known, as, the, slavonic, languages, are, indo, european, languages, spoken, primarily, by, the, slavic, peoples, and, their, descendants, they, are, thought, to, descend, from, a, proto, language, called, proto, slavic, spoken, during, the, early, middle, ages, which, in, turn, is, thought, to, have, descended, from, the, earlier, proto, balto, slavic, language, linking, the, slavic, languages, to, the, baltic, languages, in, a, balto, slavic, group, within, the, indo, european, family, the, slavic, languages, are, conventionally, that, is, also, on, the, basis, of, extralinguistic, features, divided, into, three, subgroups, east, south, and, west, which, together, constitute, more, than, 20, languages, of, these, 10, have, at, least, one, million, speakers, and, official, status, as, the, national, languages, of, the, countries, in, which, they, are, predominantly, spoken, russian, belarusian, and, ukrainian, of, the, east, group, polish, czech, and, slovak, of, the, west, group, bulgarian, and, macedonian, eastern, members, of, the, south, group, and, serbo, croatian, and, slovene, western, members, of, the, south, group, in, addition, aleksandr, dulichenko, recognizes, a, number, of, slavic, microlanguages, both, isolated, ethnolects, and, peripheral, dialects, of, more, well, established, slavic, languages, the, current, geographical, distribution, of, natively, spoken, slavic, languages, includes, the, balkans, central, and, eastern, europe, and, all, the, way, from, western, siberia, to, the, russian, far, east, furthermore, the, diasporas, of, many, slavic, peoples, have, established, isolated, minorities, of, speakers, of, their, languages, all, over, the, world, the, number, of, speakers, of, all, slavic, languages, together, was, estimated, to, be, 315, million, at, the, turn, of, the, twenty, first, century, it, is, the, largest, and, most, diverse, ethno, linguistic, group, in, europe, all, slavic, languages, have, fusional, morphology, and, with, a, partial, exception, of, bulgarian, and, macedonian, they, have, fully, developed, inflection, based, conjugation, and, declension, in, their, relational, synthesis, slavic, languages, distinguish, between, lexical, and, inflectional, suffixes, in, all, cases, the, lexical, suffix, precedes, the, inflectional, in, an, agglutination, mode, the, fusional, categorization, of, slavic, languages, is, based, on, grammatic, inflectional, suffixes, alone, prefixes, are, also, used, particularly, for, lexical, modification, of, verbs, for, example, the, equivalent, of, english, came, out, in, russian, is, vyshel, where, the, prefix, vy, means, out, the, reduced, root, sh, means, come, and, the, suffix, el, denotes, past, tense, of, masculine, gender, the, equivalent, phrase, for, a, feminine, subject, is, vyshla, the, gender, conjugation, of, verbs, as, in, the, preceding, example, is, another, feature, of, some, slavic, languages, rarely, found, in, other, language, groups, the, well, developed, fusional, grammar, allows, slavic, languages, to, have, a, somewhat, unusual, feature, of, virtually, free, word, order, in, a, sentence, clause, although, subject, verb, object, and, adjective, before, noun, is, the, preferred, order, in, the, neutral, style, of, speech, modern, bulgarian, differs, from, other, slavic, languages, because, it, almost, completely, lost, declension, it, developed, definite, articles, from, demonstrative, pronouns, similar, to, the, from, this, in, english, and, it, formed, indicative, and, renarrative, tenses, for, verbs, since, the, interwar, period, scholars, have, conventionally, divided, slavic, languages, on, the, basis, of, geographical, and, genealogical, principle, and, with, the, use, of, the, extralinguistic, feature, of, script, into, three, main, branches, that, is, east, south, and, west, from, the, vantage, of, linguistic, features, alone, there, are, only, two, branches, of, the, slavic, languages, namely, north, and, south, these, three, conventional, branches, feature, some, of, the, following, sub, branches, some, linguists, speculate, that, a, north, slavic, branch, has, existed, as, well, the, old, novgorod, dialect, may, have, reflected, some, idiosyncrasies, of, this, group, recent, studies, of, mutual, intelligibility, between, slavic, languages, revealed, that, their, traditional, three, branch, division, does, not, withstand, quantitative, scrutiny, while, the, grouping, of, czech, slovak, and, polish, into, west, slavic, turned, out, to, be, appropriate, south, slavic, croatians, and, slovenes, were, found, to, be, closer, to, czech, and, slovak, west, slavic, languages, than, to, south, slavic, bulgarian, on, the, other, hand, the, close, similarities, between, pairs, croatian, slovenian, and, czech, slovak, were, confirmed, modern, russian, differs, from, other, slavic, languages, in, an, unusually, high, percentage, of, words, of, non, slavic, origin, particularly, of, dutch, e, g, for, naval, terms, introduced, during, the, reign, of, peter, the, great, french, for, household, and, culinary, terms, during, the, reign, of, catherine, the, great, and, german, for, medical, scientific, and, military, terminology, in, the, mid, 1800, s, another, difference, between, the, east, south, and, west, slavic, branches, is, in, the, orthography, of, the, standard, languages, west, slavic, languages, and, western, south, slavic, languages, croatian, and, slovene, are, written, in, the, latin, script, and, have, had, more, western, european, influence, due, to, their, proximity, and, speakers, being, historically, roman, catholic, whereas, the, east, slavic, and, eastern, south, slavic, languages, are, written, in, cyrillic, and, with, eastern, orthodox, or, uniate, faith, have, had, more, greek, influence, two, slavic, languages, belarusian, and, serbian, are, biscriptal, commonly, written, in, either, alphabet, the, tripartite, division, of, the, slavic, languages, does, not, take, into, account, the, spoken, dialects, of, each, language, of, these, certain, so, called, transitional, dialects, and, hybrid, dialects, often, bridge, the, gaps, between, different, languages, showing, similarities, that, do, not, stand, out, when, comparing, slavic, literary, i, e, standard, languages, for, example, slovak, west, slavic, and, ukrainian, east, slavic, are, bridged, by, the, rusyn, language, spoken, in, transcarpatian, ukraine, and, adjascent, counties, of, slovakia, and, ukraine, similarly, the, croatian, kajkavian, dialect, is, more, similar, to, slovene, than, to, the, standard, croatian, language, although, the, slavic, languages, diverged, from, a, common, proto, language, later, than, any, other, groups, of, the, indo, european, language, family, enough, differences, exist, between, the, various, slavic, dialects, and, languages, to, make, communication, between, speakers, of, different, slavic, languages, difficult, within, the, individual, slavic, languages, dialects, may, vary, to, a, lesser, degree, as, those, of, russian, or, to, a, much, greater, degree, like, those, of, slovene, pontic, steppe, caucasus, east, asia, eastern, europe, northern, europe, pontic, steppe, northern, eastern, steppe, europe, south, asia, steppe, europe, caucasus, india, indo, aryans, iranians, east, asia, europe, east, asia, europe, indo, aryan, iranian, indo, aryan, iranian, others, european, slavic, languages, descend, from, proto, slavic, their, immediate, parent, language, ultimately, deriving, from, proto, indo, european, the, ancestor, language, of, all, indo, european, languages, via, a, proto, balto, slavic, stage, during, the, proto, balto, slavic, period, a, number, of, exclusive, isoglosses, in, phonology, morphology, lexis, and, syntax, developed, which, makes, slavic, and, baltic, the, closest, related, of, all, the, indo, european, branches, the, secession, of, the, balto, slavic, dialect, ancestral, to, proto, slavic, is, estimated, on, archaeological, and, glottochronological, criteria, to, have, occurred, sometime, in, the, period, 1500, 1000, bce, a, minority, of, baltists, maintain, the, view, that, the, slavic, group, of, languages, differs, so, radically, from, the, neighboring, baltic, group, lithuanian, latvian, and, the, now, extinct, old, prussian, that, they, could, not, have, shared, a, parent, language, after, the, breakup, of, the, proto, indo, european, continuum, about, five, millennia, ago, substantial, advances, in, balto, slavic, accentology, that, occurred, in, the, last, three, decades, however, make, this, view, very, hard, to, maintain, nowadays, especially, when, one, considers, that, there, was, most, likely, no, proto, baltic, language, and, that, west, baltic, and, east, baltic, differ, from, each, other, as, much, as, each, of, them, does, from, proto, slavic, the, proto, slavic, language, existed, until, around, ad, 500, by, the, 7th, century, it, had, broken, apart, into, large, dialectal, zones, there, are, no, reliable, hypotheses, about, the, nature, of, the, subsequent, breakups, of, west, and, south, slavic, east, slavic, is, generally, thought, to, converge, to, one, old, east, slavic, language, which, existed, until, at, least, the, 12th, century, linguistic, differentiation, was, accelerated, by, the, dispersion, of, the, slavic, peoples, over, a, large, territory, which, in, central, europe, exceeded, the, current, extent, of, slavic, speaking, majorities, written, documents, of, the, 9th, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, already, display, some, local, linguistic, features, for, example, the, freising, manuscripts, show, a, language, that, contains, some, phonetic, and, lexical, elements, peculiar, to, slovene, dialects, e, g, rhotacism, the, word, krilatec, the, freising, manuscripts, are, the, first, latin, script, continuous, text, in, a, slavic, language, the, migration, of, slavic, speakers, into, the, balkans, in, the, declining, centuries, of, the, byzantine, empire, expanded, the, area, of, slavic, speech, but, the, pre, existing, writing, notably, greek, survived, in, this, area, the, arrival, of, the, hungarians, in, pannonia, in, the, 9th, century, interposed, non, slavic, speakers, between, south, and, west, slavs, frankish, conquests, completed, the, geographical, separation, between, these, two, groups, also, severing, the, connection, between, slavs, in, moravia, and, lower, austria, moravians, and, those, in, present, day, styria, carinthia, east, tyrol, in, austria, and, in, the, provinces, of, modern, slovenia, where, the, ancestors, of, the, slovenes, settled, during, first, colonisation, in, september, 2015, alexei, kassian, and, anna, dybo, published, as, a, part, of, interdisciplinary, study, of, slavic, ethnogenesis, a, lexicostatistical, classification, of, slavic, languages, it, was, built, using, qualitative, 110, word, swadesh, lists, that, were, compiled, according, to, the, standards, of, the, global, lexicostatistical, database, project, and, processed, using, modern, phylogenetic, algorithms, the, resulting, dated, tree, complies, with, the, traditional, expert, views, on, the, slavic, group, structure, kassian, dybo, s, tree, suggests, that, proto, slavic, first, diverged, into, three, branches, eastern, western, and, southern, the, proto, slavic, break, up, is, dated, to, around, 100, a, d, which, correlates, with, the, archaeological, assessment, of, slavic, population, in, the, early, 1st, millennium, a, d, being, spread, on, a, large, territory, and, already, not, being, monolithic, then, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, a, d, these, three, slavic, branches, almost, simultaneously, divided, into, sub, branches, which, corresponds, to, the, fast, spread, of, the, slavs, through, eastern, europe, and, the, balkans, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, a, d, the, so, called, slavicization, of, europe, the, slovenian, language, was, excluded, from, the, analysis, as, both, ljubljana, koine, and, literary, slovenian, show, mixed, lexical, features, of, southern, and, western, slavic, languages, which, could, possibly, indicate, the, western, slavic, origin, of, slovenian, which, for, a, long, time, was, being, influenced, on, the, part, of, the, neighboring, serbo, croatian, dialects, and, the, quality, swadesh, lists, were, not, yet, collected, for, slovenian, dialects, because, of, scarcity, or, unreliability, of, data, the, study, also, did, not, cover, the, so, called, old, novgordian, dialect, the, polabian, language, and, some, other, slavic, lects, the, above, kassian, dybo, s, research, did, not, take, into, account, the, findings, by, russian, linguist, andrey, zaliznyak, who, stated, that, until, the, 14th, or, 15th, century, major, language, differences, were, not, between, the, regions, occupied, by, modern, belarus, russia, and, ukraine, but, rather, between, the, north, west, around, modern, velikiy, novgorod, and, pskov, and, the, center, around, modern, kyiv, suzdal, rostov, moscow, as, well, as, belarus, of, the, east, slavic, territories, the, old, novgorodian, dialect, of, that, time, differed, from, the, central, east, slavic, dialects, as, well, as, from, all, other, slavic, languages, much, more, than, in, later, centuries, according, to, zaliznyak, the, russian, language, developed, as, a, convergence, of, that, dialect, and, the, central, ones, whereas, ukrainian, and, belarusian, were, continuation, of, development, of, the, central, dialects, of, east, slavs, also, russian, linguist, sergey, nikolaev, analysing, historical, development, of, slavic, dialects, accent, system, concluded, that, a, number, of, other, tribes, in, kievan, rus, came, from, different, slavic, branches, and, spoke, distant, slavic, dialects, zaliznyak, and, nikolaev, s, points, mean, that, there, was, a, convergence, stage, before, the, divergence, or, simultaneously, which, was, not, taken, into, consideration, by, kassian, dybo, s, research, ukrainian, linguists, stepan, smal, stotsky, ivan, ohienko, george, shevelov, yevhen, tymchenko, vsevolod, hantsov, olena, kurylo, deny, the, existence, of, a, common, old, east, slavic, language, at, any, time, in, the, past, according, to, them, the, dialects, of, east, slavic, tribes, evolved, gradually, from, the, common, proto, slavic, language, without, any, intermediate, stages, the, following, is, a, summary, of, the, main, changes, from, proto, indo, european, pie, leading, up, to, the, common, slavic, cs, period, immediately, following, the, proto, slavic, language, ps, the, slavic, languages, are, a, relatively, homogeneous, family, compared, with, other, families, of, indo, european, languages, e, g, germanic, romance, and, indo, iranian, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, ad, the, entire, slavic, speaking, area, still, functioned, as, a, single, dialectally, differentiated, language, termed, common, slavic, compared, with, most, other, indo, european, languages, the, slavic, languages, are, quite, conservative, particularly, in, terms, of, morphology, the, means, of, inflecting, nouns, and, verbs, to, indicate, grammatical, differences, most, slavic, languages, have, a, rich, fusional, morphology, that, conserves, much, of, the, inflectional, morphology, of, proto, indo, european, the, vocabulary, of, the, slavic, languages, is, also, of, indo, european, origin, many, of, its, elements, which, do, not, find, exact, matches, in, the, ancient, indo, european, languages, are, associated, with, the, balto, slavic, community, the, following, table, shows, the, inventory, of, consonants, of, late, common, slavic, 1, the, sound, s, did, not, occur, in, west, slavic, where, it, had, developed, to, this, inventory, of, sounds, is, quite, similar, to, what, is, found, in, most, modern, slavic, languages, the, extensive, series, of, palatal, consonants, along, with, the, affricates, ts, and, dz, developed, through, a, series, of, palatalizations, that, happened, during, the, proto, slavic, period, from, earlier, sequences, either, of, velar, consonants, followed, by, front, vowels, e, g, ke, ki, ge, gi, xe, and, xi, or, of, various, consonants, followed, by, j, e, g, tj, dj, sj, zj, rj, lj, kj, and, gj, where, j, is, the, palatal, approximant, the, sound, of, the, english, letter, y, in, yes, or, you, the, biggest, change, in, this, inventory, results, from, a, further, general, palatalization, occurring, near, the, end, of, the, common, slavic, period, where, all, consonants, became, palatalized, before, front, vowels, this, produced, a, large, number, of, new, palatalized, or, soft, sounds, which, formed, pairs, with, the, corresponding, non, palatalized, or, hard, consonants, and, absorbed, the, existing, palatalized, sounds, l, r, n, s, these, sounds, were, best, preserved, in, russian, but, were, lost, to, varying, degrees, in, other, languages, particularly, czech, and, slovak, the, following, table, shows, the, inventory, of, modern, russian, this, general, process, of, palatalization, did, not, occur, in, serbo, croatian, and, slovenian, as, a, result, the, modern, consonant, inventory, of, these, languages, is, nearly, identical, to, the, late, common, slavic, inventory, late, common, slavic, tolerated, relatively, few, consonant, clusters, however, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, certain, formerly, present, vowels, the, weak, yers, the, modern, slavic, languages, allow, quite, complex, clusters, as, in, the, russian, word, flash, also, present, in, many, slavic, languages, are, clusters, rarely, found, cross, linguistically, as, in, russian, mercury, or, polish, mch, u, moss, gen, sg, the, word, for, mercury, with, the, initial, rt, cluster, for, example, is, also, found, in, the, other, east, and, west, slavic, languages, although, slovak, retains, an, epenthetic, vowel, ortu, a, typical, vowel, inventory, is, as, follows, the, sound, occurs, only, in, some, languages, e, g, russian, and, belarusian, and, even, in, these, languages, it, is, often, unclear, whether, it, is, its, own, phoneme, or, an, allophone, of, i, nonetheless, it, is, a, quite, prominent, and, noticeable, characteristic, of, the, languages, in, which, it, is, present, common, slavic, also, had, two, nasal, vowels, and, however, these, are, preserved, only, in, modern, polish, along, with, a, few, lesser, known, dialects, and, microlanguages, see, yus, for, more, details, other, phonemic, vowels, are, found, in, certain, languages, e, g, the, schwa, in, bulgarian, and, slovenian, distinct, high, mid, and, low, mid, vowels, in, slovenian, and, the, lax, front, vowel, in, ukrainian, an, area, of, great, difference, among, slavic, languages, is, that, of, prosody, i, e, syllabic, distinctions, such, as, vowel, length, accent, and, tone, common, slavic, had, a, complex, system, of, prosody, inherited, with, little, change, from, proto, indo, european, this, consisted, of, phonemic, vowel, length, and, a, free, mobile, pitch, accent, the, modern, languages, vary, greatly, in, the, extent, to, which, they, preserve, this, system, on, one, extreme, serbo, croatian, preserves, the, system, nearly, unchanged, even, more, so, in, the, conservative, chakavian, dialect, on, the, other, macedonian, has, basically, lost, the, system, in, its, entirety, between, them, are, found, numerous, variations, similarly, slavic, languages, have, extensive, morphophonemic, alternations, in, their, derivational, and, inflectional, morphology, including, between, velar, and, postalveolar, consonants, front, and, back, vowels, and, a, vowel, and, no, vowel, the, following, is, a, very, brief, selection, of, cognates, in, basic, vocabulary, across, the, slavic, language, family, which, may, serve, to, give, an, idea, of, the, sound, changes, involved, this, is, not, a, list, of, translations, cognates, have, a, common, origin, but, their, meaning, may, be, shifted, and, loanwords, may, have, replaced, them, most, languages, of, the, former, soviet, union, and, of, some, neighbouring, countries, for, example, mongolian, are, significantly, influenced, by, russian, especially, in, vocabulary, the, romanian, albanian, and, hungarian, languages, show, the, influence, of, the, neighboring, slavic, nations, especially, in, vocabulary, pertaining, to, urban, life, agriculture, and, crafts, and, trade, the, major, cultural, innovations, at, times, of, limited, long, range, cultural, contact, in, each, one, of, these, languages, slavic, lexical, borrowings, represent, at, least, 15, of, the, total, vocabulary, this, is, potentially, because, slavic, tribes, crossed, and, partially, settled, the, territories, inhabited, by, ancient, illyrians, and, vlachs, on, their, way, to, the, balkans, max, vasmer, a, specialist, in, slavic, etymology, has, claimed, that, there, were, no, slavic, loans, into, proto, germanic, however, there, are, isolated, slavic, loans, mostly, recent, into, other, germanic, languages, for, example, the, word, for, border, in, modern, german, grenze, dutch, grens, was, borrowed, from, the, common, slavic, granica, there, are, however, many, cities, and, villages, of, slavic, origin, in, eastern, germany, the, largest, of, which, are, berlin, leipzig, and, dresden, english, derives, quark, a, kind, of, cheese, and, subatomic, particle, from, the, german, quark, which, in, turn, is, derived, from, the, slavic, tvarog, which, means, curd, many, german, surnames, particularly, in, eastern, germany, and, austria, are, slavic, in, origin, the, nordic, languages, also, have, torg, torv, market, place, from, old, russian, t, rg, tr, g, or, polish, targ, humle, hops, r, ka, reke, reje, shrimp, prawn, and, via, middle, low, german, tolk, interpreter, from, old, slavic, tl, k, and, pr, m, pram, barge, from, west, slavonic, pram, finnic, and, slavic, languages, have, many, words, in, common, according, to, petri, kallio, this, suggests, slavic, words, being, borrowed, into, finnish, languages, as, early, as, proto, finnic, many, loanwords, have, acquired, a, finnicized, form, making, it, difficult, to, say, whether, such, a, word, is, natively, finnic, or, slavic, the, czech, word, robot, is, now, found, in, most, languages, worldwide, and, the, word, pistol, probably, also, from, czech, is, found, in, many, european, languages, a, well, known, slavic, word, in, almost, all, european, languages, is, vodka, a, borrowing, from, russian, vodka, lit, little, water, from, common, slavic, voda, water, cognate, to, the, english, word, water, with, the, diminutive, ending, ka, owing, to, the, medieval, fur, trade, with, northern, russia, pan, european, loans, from, russian, include, such, familiar, words, as, sable, the, english, word, vampire, was, borrowed, perhaps, via, french, vampire, from, german, vampir, in, turn, derived, from, serbo, croatian, vampir, continuing, proto, slavic, pyr, although, polish, scholar, k, stachowski, has, argued, that, the, origin, of, the, word, is, early, slavic, v, p, r, going, back, to, turkic, oobyr, several, european, languages, including, english, have, borrowed, the, word, polje, meaning, large, flat, plain, directly, from, the, former, yugoslav, languages, i, e, slovene, and, serbo, croatian, during, the, heyday, of, the, ussr, in, the, 20th, century, many, more, russian, words, became, known, worldwide, da, soviet, sputnik, perestroika, glasnost, kolkhoz, etc, another, borrowed, russian, term, is, samovar, lit, self, boiling, the, following, tree, for, the, slavic, languages, derives, from, the, ethnologue, report, for, slavic, languages, it, includes, the, iso, 639, 1, and, iso, 639, 3, codes, where, available, east, slavic, languages, south, slavic, languages, west, slavic, languages, para, and, supranational, languages
