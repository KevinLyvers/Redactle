federalism, is, a, mode, of, government, that, combines, a, general, government, the, central, or, federal, government, with, regional, governments, provincial, state, cantonal, territorial, or, other, sub, unit, governments, in, a, single, political, system, dividing, the, powers, between, the, two, johannes, althusius, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, federalism, along, with, montesquieu, althusius, notably, exposes, the, bases, of, this, political, philosophy, in, politica, methodice, digesta, atque, exemplis, sacris, et, profanis, illustrata, 1603, in, the, spirit, of, law, montesquieu, for, his, part, sees, examples, of, federalist, republics, in, corporate, societies, the, polis, bringing, together, villages, and, the, cities, themselves, forming, confederations, federalism, in, the, modern, era, was, first, adopted, in, the, unions, of, states, during, the, old, swiss, confederacy, federalism, differs, from, confederalism, in, which, the, general, level, of, government, is, subordinate, to, the, regional, level, and, from, devolution, within, a, unitary, state, in, which, the, regional, level, of, government, is, subordinate, to, the, general, level, it, represents, the, central, form, in, the, pathway, of, regional, integration, or, separation, bounded, on, the, less, integrated, side, by, confederalism, and, on, the, more, integrated, side, by, devolution, within, a, unitary, state, examples, of, a, federation, or, federal, province, or, state, include, argentina, australia, austria, belgium, bosnia, and, herzegovina, brazil, canada, ethiopia, germany, india, iraq, malaysia, mexico, micronesia, nepal, nigeria, pakistan, russia, somalia, south, sudan, sudan, switzerland, the, united, arab, emirates, the, united, states, and, venezuela, some, characterize, the, european, union, as, the, pioneering, example, of, federalism, in, a, multi, state, setting, in, a, concept, termed, the, federal, union, of, states, the, terms, federalism, and, confederalism, share, a, root, in, the, latin, word, foedus, meaning, treaty, pact, or, covenant, their, common, early, meaning, until, the, late, eighteenth, century, was, a, simple, league, or, inter, governmental, relationship, among, sovereign, states, based, on, a, treaty, they, were, therefore, initially, synonyms, it, was, in, this, sense, that, james, madison, in, the, federalist, no, 39, had, referred, to, the, new, us, constitution, as, neither, a, national, nor, a, federal, constitution, but, a, composition, of, both, i, e, as, constituting, neither, a, single, large, unitary, state, nor, a, league, confederation, among, several, small, states, but, a, hybrid, of, the, two, in, the, course, of, the, nineteenth, century, united, states, the, meaning, of, federalism, would, come, to, shift, strengthening, to, refer, uniquely, to, the, novel, compound, political, form, established, at, the, philadelphia, convention, while, the, meaning, of, confederalism, would, remain, at, a, league, of, states, in, the, narrow, sense, federalism, refers, to, the, mode, in, which, the, body, politic, of, a, state, is, organized, internally, and, this, is, the, meaning, most, often, used, in, modern, times, political, scientists, however, use, it, in, a, much, broader, sense, referring, instead, to, a, multi, layer, or, pluralistic, concept, of, social, and, political, life, the, first, forms, of, federalism, took, place, in, ancient, times, in, the, form, of, alliances, between, states, some, examples, from, the, seventh, to, second, century, b, c, were, the, archaic, league, the, aetolic, league, the, peloponnesian, league, and, the, delian, league, an, early, ancestor, of, federalism, was, the, achaean, league, in, hellenistic, greece, unlike, the, greek, city, states, of, classical, greece, each, of, which, insisted, on, keeping, its, complete, independence, changing, conditions, in, the, hellenistic, period, drove, many, city, states, to, band, together, even, at, the, cost, of, losing, part, of, their, sovereignty, subsequent, unions, of, states, included, the, first, and, second, swiss, confederations, 1291, 1798, and, 1815, 48, the, united, provinces, of, the, netherlands, 1579, 1795, the, german, bund, 1815, 66, the, first, american, union, known, as, the, confederation, of, the, united, states, of, america, 1781, 89, and, second, american, union, formed, as, the, united, states, of, america, 1789, present, modern, federalism, is, a, political, system, based, upon, democratic, rules, and, institutions, in, which, the, power, to, govern, is, shared, between, national, and, provincial, state, governments, the, term, federalist, describes, several, political, beliefs, around, the, world, depending, on, context, since, the, term, federalization, also, describes, distinctive, political, processes, its, use, as, well, depends, on, the, context, in, political, theory, two, main, types, of, federalization, are, recognized, according, to, daniel, ziblatt, there, are, four, competing, theoretical, explanations, in, the, academic, literature, for, the, adoption, of, federal, systems, immanuel, kant, noted, that, the, problem, of, setting, up, a, state, can, be, solved, even, by, a, nation, of, devils, so, long, as, they, possess, an, appropriate, constitution, which, pits, opposing, factions, against, each, other, with, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, in, particular, individual, states, required, a, federation, as, a, safeguard, against, the, possibility, of, war, proponents, for, federal, systems, have, historically, argued, that, the, power, sharing, inherent, in, federal, systems, reduces, both, domestic, security, threats, and, foreign, threats, federalism, allows, states, to, be, large, and, diverse, mitigating, the, risk, of, a, tyrannical, government, through, centralization, of, powers, many, countries, have, implemented, federal, systems, of, government, with, varying, degree, of, central, and, regional, sovereignty, the, federal, government, of, these, countries, can, be, divided, into, minimalistic, federations, consisting, of, only, two, sub, federal, units, or, multi, regional, those, that, consist, of, three, to, dozens, of, regional, governments, they, can, also, be, grouped, based, on, their, body, polity, type, such, as, emirate, provincial, republican, or, state, federal, systems, another, way, to, study, federated, countries, is, by, categorizing, them, into, those, whose, entire, territory, is, federated, as, opposed, to, only, part, of, its, territory, comprising, the, federal, portion, of, the, country, some, federal, systems, are, national, systems, while, others, like, the, european, union, are, supra, national, in, general, two, extremes, of, federalism, can, be, distinguished, at, one, extreme, the, strong, federal, state, is, almost, completely, unitary, with, few, powers, reserved, for, local, governments, while, at, the, other, extreme, the, national, government, may, be, a, federal, state, in, name, only, being, a, confederation, in, actuality, federalism, may, encompass, as, few, as, two, or, three, internal, divisions, as, is, the, case, in, belgium, or, bosnia, and, herzegovina, the, governments, of, argentina, australia, brazil, india, and, mexico, among, others, are, also, organized, along, federalist, principles, in, canada, federalism, typically, implies, opposition, to, sovereigntist, movements, most, commonly, quebec, separatism, in, 1999, the, government, of, canada, established, the, forum, of, federations, as, an, international, network, for, exchange, of, best, practices, among, federal, and, federalizing, countries, headquartered, in, ottawa, the, forum, of, federations, partner, governments, include, australia, brazil, ethiopia, germany, india, mexico, nigeria, pakistan, and, switzerland, in, europe, federalist, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, those, who, favor, a, common, federal, government, with, distributed, power, at, regional, national, and, supranational, levels, the, union, of, european, federalists, advocates, for, this, development, within, the, european, union, ultimately, leading, to, the, united, states, of, europe, although, there, are, medieval, and, early, modern, examples, of, european, states, which, used, confederal, and, federal, systems, contemporary, european, federalism, originated, in, post, war, europe, one, of, the, more, important, initiatives, was, winston, churchill, s, speech, in, z, rich, in, 1946, in, the, united, states, federalism, originally, referred, to, belief, in, a, stronger, central, government, when, the, u, s, constitution, was, being, drafted, the, federalist, party, supported, a, stronger, central, government, while, anti, federalists, wanted, a, weaker, central, government, this, is, very, different, from, the, modern, usage, of, federalism, in, europe, and, the, united, states, the, distinction, stems, from, the, fact, that, federalism, is, situated, in, the, middle, of, the, political, spectrum, between, a, confederacy, and, a, unitary, state, the, u, s, constitution, was, written, as, a, replacement, for, the, articles, of, confederation, under, which, the, united, states, was, a, loose, confederation, with, a, weak, central, government, in, contrast, europe, has, a, greater, history, of, unitary, states, than, north, america, thus, european, federalism, argues, for, a, weaker, central, government, relative, to, a, unitary, state, the, modern, american, usage, of, the, word, is, much, closer, to, the, european, sense, as, the, power, of, the, u, s, federal, government, has, increased, some, people, have, perceived, a, much, more, unitary, state, than, they, believe, the, founding, fathers, intended, most, people, politically, advocating, federalism, in, the, united, states, argue, in, favor, of, limiting, the, powers, of, the, federal, government, especially, the, judiciary, see, federalist, society, new, federalism, the, contemporary, concept, of, federalism, came, about, with, the, creation, of, an, entirely, new, system, of, government, that, provided, for, democratic, representation, at, two, governing, levels, simultaneously, which, was, implemented, in, the, us, constitution, in, the, united, states, implementation, of, federalism, a, bicameral, general, government, consisting, of, a, chamber, of, popular, representation, proportional, to, population, the, house, of, representatives, and, a, chamber, of, equal, state, based, representation, consisting, of, two, delegates, per, state, the, senate, was, overlaid, upon, the, pre, existing, regional, governments, of, the, thirteen, independent, states, with, each, level, of, government, allocated, a, defined, sphere, of, powers, under, a, written, constitution, and, the, rule, of, law, that, is, subject, to, the, independent, third, party, arbitration, of, a, supreme, court, in, competence, disputes, the, two, levels, were, thus, brought, into, a, coordinate, relationship, for, the, first, time, in, 1946, kenneth, wheare, observed, that, the, two, levels, of, government, in, the, us, were, co, equally, supreme, in, this, he, echoed, the, perspective, of, american, founding, father, james, madison, who, saw, the, several, states, as, forming, distinct, and, independent, portions, of, the, supremacy, in, relation, to, the, general, government, in, a, federation, the, division, of, power, between, federal, and, regional, governments, is, usually, outlined, in, the, constitution, almost, every, country, allows, some, degree, of, regional, self, government, but, in, federations, the, right, to, self, government, of, the, component, states, is, constitutionally, entrenched, component, states, often, also, possess, their, own, constitutions, which, they, may, amend, as, they, see, fit, although, in, the, event, of, conflict, the, federal, constitution, usually, takes, precedence, in, almost, all, federations, the, central, government, enjoys, the, powers, of, foreign, policy, and, national, defense, as, exclusive, federal, powers, were, this, not, the, case, a, federation, would, not, be, a, single, sovereign, state, per, the, un, definition, notably, the, states, of, germany, retain, the, right, to, act, on, their, own, behalf, at, an, international, level, a, condition, originally, granted, in, exchange, for, the, kingdom, of, bavaria, s, agreement, to, join, the, german, empire, in, 1871, the, constitutions, of, germany, and, the, united, states, provide, that, all, powers, not, specifically, granted, to, the, federal, government, are, retained, by, the, states, the, constitution, of, some, countries, like, canada, and, india, state, that, powers, not, explicitly, granted, to, the, provincial, state, governments, are, retained, by, the, federal, government, much, like, the, us, system, the, australian, constitution, allocates, to, the, federal, government, the, commonwealth, of, australia, the, power, to, make, laws, about, certain, specified, matters, which, were, considered, too, difficult, for, the, states, to, manage, so, that, the, states, retain, all, other, areas, of, responsibility, under, the, division, of, powers, of, the, european, union, in, the, lisbon, treaty, powers, which, are, not, either, exclusively, of, union, competence, or, shared, between, the, union, and, the, member, states, as, concurrent, powers, are, retained, by, the, constituent, states, where, every, component, state, of, a, federation, possesses, the, same, powers, we, are, said, to, find, symmetric, federalism, asymmetric, federalism, exists, where, states, are, granted, different, powers, or, some, possess, greater, autonomy, than, others, do, this, is, often, done, in, recognition, of, the, existence, of, a, distinct, culture, in, a, particular, region, or, regions, in, spain, the, basques, and, catalans, as, well, as, the, galicians, spearheaded, a, historic, movement, to, have, their, national, specificity, recognized, crystallizing, in, the, historical, communities, such, as, navarre, galicia, catalonia, and, the, basque, country, they, have, more, powers, than, the, later, expanded, arrangement, for, other, spanish, regions, or, the, spain, of, the, autonomous, communities, called, also, the, coffee, for, everyone, arrangement, partly, to, deal, with, their, separate, identity, and, to, appease, peripheral, nationalist, leanings, partly, out, of, respect, to, specific, rights, they, had, held, earlier, in, history, however, strictly, speaking, spain, is, not, a, federation, but, a, system, of, asymmetric, devolved, government, within, a, unitary, state, it, is, common, that, during, the, historical, evolution, of, a, federation, there, is, a, gradual, movement, of, power, from, the, component, states, to, the, centre, as, the, federal, government, acquires, additional, powers, sometimes, to, deal, with, unforeseen, circumstances, the, acquisition, of, new, powers, by, a, federal, government, may, occur, through, formal, constitutional, amendment, or, simply, through, a, broadening, of, the, interpretation, of, a, government, s, existing, constitutional, powers, given, by, the, courts, usually, a, federation, is, formed, at, two, levels, the, central, government, and, the, regions, states, provinces, territories, and, little, to, nothing, is, said, about, second, or, third, level, administrative, political, entities, brazil, is, an, exception, because, the, 1988, constitution, included, the, municipalities, as, autonomous, political, entities, making, the, federation, tripartite, encompassing, the, union, the, states, and, the, municipalities, each, state, is, divided, into, municipalities, munic, pios, with, their, own, legislative, council, c, mara, de, vereadores, and, a, mayor, prefeito, which, are, partly, autonomous, from, both, federal, and, state, government, each, municipality, has, a, little, constitution, called, organic, law, lei, org, nica, mexico, is, an, intermediate, case, in, that, municipalities, are, granted, full, autonomy, by, the, federal, constitution, and, their, existence, as, autonomous, entities, municipio, libre, free, municipality, is, established, by, the, federal, government, and, cannot, be, revoked, by, the, states, constitutions, moreover, the, federal, constitution, determines, which, powers, and, competencies, belong, exclusively, to, the, municipalities, and, not, to, the, constituent, states, however, municipalities, do, not, have, an, elected, legislative, assembly, federations, often, employ, the, paradox, of, being, a, union, of, states, while, still, being, states, or, having, aspects, of, statehood, in, themselves, for, example, james, madison, author, of, the, united, states, constitution, wrote, in, federalist, paper, no, 39, that, the, us, constitution, is, in, strictness, neither, a, national, nor, a, federal, constitution, but, a, composition, of, both, in, its, foundation, it, is, federal, not, national, in, the, sources, from, which, the, ordinary, powers, of, the, government, are, drawn, it, is, partly, federal, and, partly, national, this, stems, from, the, fact, that, states, in, the, us, maintain, all, sovereignty, that, they, do, not, yield, to, the, federation, by, their, own, consent, this, was, reaffirmed, by, the, tenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, which, reserves, all, powers, and, rights, that, are, not, delegated, to, the, federal, government, as, left, to, the, states, and, to, the, people, the, structures, of, most, federal, governments, incorporate, mechanisms, to, protect, the, rights, of, component, states, one, method, known, as, intrastate, federalism, is, to, directly, represent, the, governments, of, component, states, in, federal, political, institutions, where, a, federation, has, a, bicameral, legislature, the, upper, house, is, often, used, to, represent, the, component, states, while, the, lower, house, represents, the, people, of, the, nation, as, a, whole, a, federal, upper, house, may, be, based, on, a, special, scheme, of, apportionment, as, is, the, case, in, the, senates, of, the, united, states, and, australia, where, each, state, is, represented, by, an, equal, number, of, senators, irrespective, of, the, size, of, its, population, alternatively, or, in, addition, to, this, practice, the, members, of, an, upper, house, may, be, indirectly, elected, by, the, government, or, legislature, of, the, component, states, as, occurred, in, the, united, states, prior, to, 1913, or, be, actual, members, or, delegates, of, the, state, governments, as, for, example, is, the, case, in, the, german, bundesrat, and, in, the, council, of, the, european, union, the, lower, house, of, a, federal, legislature, is, usually, directly, elected, with, apportionment, in, proportion, to, population, although, states, may, sometimes, still, be, guaranteed, a, certain, minimum, number, of, seats, in, canada, the, provincial, governments, represent, regional, interests, and, negotiate, directly, with, the, central, government, a, first, ministers, conference, of, the, prime, minister, and, the, provincial, premiers, is, the, de, facto, highest, political, forum, in, the, land, although, it, is, not, mentioned, in, the, constitution, federations, often, have, special, procedures, for, amendment, of, the, federal, constitution, as, well, as, reflecting, the, federal, structure, of, the, state, this, may, guarantee, that, the, self, governing, status, of, the, component, states, cannot, be, abolished, without, their, consent, an, amendment, to, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, must, be, ratified, by, three, quarters, of, either, the, state, legislatures, or, of, constitutional, conventions, specially, elected, in, each, of, the, states, before, it, can, come, into, effect, in, referendums, to, amend, the, constitutions, of, australia, and, switzerland, it, is, required, that, a, proposal, be, endorsed, not, just, by, an, overall, majority, of, the, electorate, in, the, nation, as, a, whole, but, also, by, separate, majorities, in, each, of, a, majority, of, the, states, or, cantons, in, australia, this, latter, requirement, is, known, as, a, double, majority, some, federal, constitutions, also, provide, that, certain, constitutional, amendments, cannot, occur, without, the, unanimous, consent, of, all, states, or, of, a, particular, state, the, us, constitution, provides, that, no, state, may, be, deprived, of, equal, representation, in, the, senate, without, its, consent, in, australia, if, a, proposed, amendment, will, specifically, impact, one, or, more, states, then, it, must, be, endorsed, in, the, referendum, held, in, each, of, those, states, any, amendment, to, the, canadian, constitution, that, would, modify, the, role, of, the, monarchy, would, require, unanimous, consent, of, the, provinces, the, german, basic, law, provides, that, no, amendment, is, admissible, at, all, that, would, abolish, the, federal, system, it, has, been, argued, that, federalism, and, other, forms, of, territorial, autonomy, are, a, useful, way, to, structure, political, systems, in, order, to, prevent, violence, among, different, groups, within, countries, because, it, allows, certain, groups, to, legislate, at, the, subnational, level, some, scholars, have, suggested, however, that, federalism, can, divide, countries, and, result, in, state, collapse, because, it, creates, proto, states, still, others, have, shown, that, federalism, is, only, divisive, when, it, lacks, mechanisms, that, encourage, political, parties, to, compete, across, regional, boundaries, federalism, is, sometimes, viewed, in, the, context, of, international, negotiation, as, the, best, system, for, integrating, diverse, nations, ethnic, groups, or, combatant, parties, all, of, whom, may, have, cause, to, fear, control, by, an, overly, powerful, center, however, those, skeptical, of, federal, prescriptions, sometimes, believe, that, increased, regional, autonomy, can, lead, to, secession, or, dissolution, of, the, nation, in, syria, for, example, federalization, proposals, have, failed, in, part, because, syrians, fear, that, these, borders, could, turn, out, to, be, the, same, as, the, ones, that, the, fighting, parties, have, currently, carved, out
