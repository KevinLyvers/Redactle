civil, law, is, a, legal, system, originating, in, italy, and, france, that, has, been, adopted, in, large, parts, of, the, world, modern, civil, law, stems, mainly, from, the, napoleonic, code, of, the, early, 19th, century, and, it, is, a, continuation, of, ancient, roman, law, its, core, principles, are, codified, into, a, referable, system, which, serves, as, the, primary, source, of, law, the, civil, law, system, is, often, contrasted, with, the, common, law, system, which, originated, in, medieval, england, whereas, the, civil, law, takes, the, form, of, legal, codes, the, common, law, comes, from, uncodified, case, law, that, arises, as, a, result, of, judicial, decisions, recognising, prior, court, decisions, as, legally, binding, precedent, historically, a, civil, law, is, the, group, of, legal, ideas, and, systems, ultimately, derived, from, the, corpus, juris, civilis, but, heavily, overlain, by, napoleonic, germanic, canonical, feudal, and, local, practices, as, well, as, doctrinal, strains, such, as, natural, law, codification, and, legal, positivism, the, napoleonic, code, is, the, most, widespread, system, of, law, in, the, world, in, force, in, various, forms, in, about, 120, countries, conceptually, civil, law, proceeds, from, abstractions, formulates, general, principles, and, distinguishes, substantive, rules, from, procedural, rules, it, holds, case, law, secondary, and, subordinate, to, statutory, law, civil, law, is, often, paired, with, the, inquisitorial, system, but, the, terms, are, not, synonymous, there, are, key, differences, between, a, statute, and, a, code, the, most, pronounced, features, of, civil, systems, are, their, legal, codes, with, concise, and, broadly, applicable, texts, that, typically, avoid, factually, specific, scenarios, the, short, articles, in, a, civil, law, code, deal, in, generalities, and, stand, in, contrast, with, ordinary, statutes, which, are, often, very, long, and, very, detailed, the, civil, law, system, is, the, most, widespread, system, of, law, in, the, world, in, force, in, various, forms, in, about, 150, countries, civil, law, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, neo, roman, law, romano, germanic, law, or, continental, law, the, expression, civil, law, is, a, translation, of, latin, jus, civile, or, citizens, law, which, was, the, late, imperial, term, for, its, legal, system, as, opposed, to, the, laws, governing, conquered, peoples, jus, gentium, hence, the, justinian, code, s, title, corpus, juris, civilis, civil, law, practitioners, however, traditionally, refer, to, their, system, in, a, broad, sense, as, jus, commune, it, draws, heavily, from, roman, law, arguably, the, most, intricate, known, legal, system, before, the, modern, era, in, civil, law, legal, systems, where, codes, exist, the, primary, source, of, law, is, the, law, code, a, systematic, collection, of, interrelated, articles, arranged, by, subject, matter, in, some, pre, specified, order, codes, explain, the, principles, of, law, rights, and, entitlements, and, how, basic, legal, mechanisms, work, the, purpose, of, codification, is, to, provide, all, citizens, with, manners, and, written, collection, of, the, laws, which, apply, to, them, and, which, judges, must, follow, law, codes, are, laws, enacted, by, a, legislature, even, if, they, are, in, general, much, longer, than, other, laws, rather, than, a, compendium, of, statutes, or, catalog, of, case, law, the, code, sets, out, general, principles, as, rules, of, law, while, the, typical, french, speaking, supreme, court, decision, is, short, concise, and, devoid, of, explanation, or, justification, in, germanic, europe, the, supreme, courts, can, and, do, tend, to, write, more, verbose, opinions, supported, by, legal, reasoning, a, line, of, similar, case, decisions, while, not, precedent, per, se, constitute, jurisprudence, constante, while, civil, law, jurisdictions, place, little, reliance, on, court, decisions, they, tend, to, generate, a, phenomenal, number, of, reported, legal, opinions, however, this, tends, to, be, uncontrolled, since, there, is, no, statutory, requirement, that, any, case, be, reported, or, published, in, a, law, report, except, for, the, councils, of, state, and, constitutional, courts, except, for, the, highest, courts, all, publication, of, legal, opinions, is, unofficial, or, commercial, civil, law, systems, can, be, divided, into, a, prominent, example, of, a, civil, law, code, is, the, napoleonic, code, 1804, named, after, french, emperor, napoleon, the, napoleonic, code, comprises, three, components, another, prominent, civil, code, is, the, german, civil, code, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, or, bgb, which, went, into, effect, in, the, german, empire, in, 1900, the, german, civil, code, is, highly, influential, inspiring, the, civil, codes, in, countries, such, as, japan, south, korea, and, switzerland, 1907, it, is, divided, into, five, parts, civil, law, takes, as, its, major, inspiration, classical, roman, law, c, ad, 1, 250, and, in, particular, justinian, law, 6th, century, ad, and, further, expanded, and, developed, in, the, late, middle, ages, under, the, influence, of, canon, law, the, justinian, code, s, doctrines, provided, a, sophisticated, model, for, contracts, rules, of, procedure, family, law, wills, and, a, strong, monarchical, constitutional, system, roman, law, was, received, differently, in, different, countries, in, some, it, went, into, force, wholesale, by, legislative, act, i, e, it, became, positive, law, whereas, in, others, it, was, diffused, into, society, by, increasingly, influential, legal, experts, and, scholars, roman, law, continued, without, interruption, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, until, its, final, fall, in, the, 15th, century, however, given, the, empire, s, influence, on, the, continent, in, late, antiquity, and, then, multiple, incursions, and, occupations, by, western, european, powers, in, the, late, medieval, period, its, laws, became, widely, implemented, in, the, west, it, was, first, received, in, the, holy, roman, empire, partly, because, it, was, considered, imperial, law, and, it, spread, in, europe, mainly, because, its, students, were, the, only, trained, lawyers, it, became, the, basis, of, scots, law, though, partly, rivaled, by, received, feudal, norman, law, in, england, it, was, taught, academically, at, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, but, underlay, only, probate, and, matrimonial, law, insofar, as, both, were, inherited, from, canon, law, and, maritime, law, adapted, from, lex, mercatoria, through, the, bordeaux, trade, consequently, neither, of, the, two, waves, of, roman, influence, completely, dominated, in, europe, roman, law, was, ultimately, a, secondary, source, that, was, applied, only, when, local, customs, and, laws, were, found, lacking, on, a, certain, subject, however, after, a, time, even, local, law, came, to, be, interpreted, and, evaluated, primarily, on, the, basis, of, roman, law, since, it, was, a, common, european, legal, tradition, of, sorts, and, thereby, in, turn, influenced, the, main, source, of, law, eventually, the, work, of, civilian, glossators, and, commentators, led, to, the, development, of, a, common, body, of, law, and, writing, about, law, a, common, legal, language, and, a, common, method, of, teaching, and, scholarship, all, termed, the, jus, commune, or, law, common, to, europe, which, consolidated, canon, law, and, roman, law, and, to, some, extent, feudal, law, an, important, common, characteristic, of, civil, law, aside, from, its, origins, in, roman, law, is, the, comprehensive, codification, of, received, roman, law, i, e, its, inclusion, in, civil, codes, the, earliest, codification, known, is, the, code, of, hammurabi, written, in, ancient, babylon, during, the, 18th, century, bc, however, this, and, many, of, the, codes, that, followed, were, mainly, lists, of, civil, and, criminal, wrongs, and, their, punishments, the, codification, typical, of, modern, civilian, systems, did, not, first, appear, until, the, justinian, code, germanic, codes, appeared, over, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, to, clearly, delineate, the, law, in, force, for, germanic, privileged, classes, versus, their, roman, subjects, and, regulate, those, laws, according, to, folk, right, under, feudal, law, a, number, of, private, custumals, were, compiled, first, under, the, norman, empire, tr, s, ancien, coutumier, 1200, 1245, then, elsewhere, to, record, the, manorial, and, later, regional, customs, court, decisions, and, the, legal, principles, underpinning, them, custumals, were, commissioned, by, lords, who, presided, as, lay, judges, over, manorial, courts, in, order, to, inform, themselves, about, the, court, process, the, use, of, custumals, from, influential, towns, soon, became, commonplace, over, large, areas, in, keeping, with, this, certain, monarchs, consolidated, their, kingdoms, by, attempting, to, compile, custumals, that, would, serve, as, the, law, of, the, land, for, their, realms, as, when, charles, vii, of, france, in, 1454, commissioned, an, official, custumal, of, crown, law, two, prominent, examples, include, the, coutume, de, paris, written, 1510, revised, 1580, which, served, as, the, basis, for, the, napoleonic, code, and, the, sachsenspiegel, c, 1220, of, the, bishoprics, of, magdeburg, and, halberstadt, which, was, used, in, northern, germany, poland, and, the, low, countries, the, concept, of, codification, was, further, developed, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, ad, as, an, expression, of, both, natural, law, and, the, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, the, political, ideals, of, that, era, was, expressed, by, the, concepts, of, democracy, protection, of, property, and, the, rule, of, law, those, ideals, required, certainty, of, law, recorded, uniform, law, so, the, mix, of, roman, law, and, customary, and, local, law, gave, way, to, law, codification, also, the, notion, of, a, nation, state, implied, recorded, law, that, would, be, applicable, to, that, state, there, was, also, a, reaction, to, law, codification, the, proponents, of, codification, regarded, it, as, conducive, to, certainty, unity, and, systematic, recording, of, the, law, whereas, its, opponents, claimed, that, codification, would, result, in, the, ossification, of, the, law, in, the, end, despite, whatever, resistance, to, codification, the, codification, of, continental, european, private, laws, moved, forward, codifications, were, completed, by, denmark, 1687, sweden, 1734, prussia, 1794, france, 1804, and, austria, 1811, the, french, codes, were, imported, into, areas, conquered, by, napoleon, and, later, adopted, with, modifications, in, poland, duchy, of, warsaw, congress, poland, kodeks, cywilny, 1806, 1825, louisiana, 1807, canton, of, vaud, switzerland, 1819, the, netherlands, 1838, serbia, 1844, italy, and, romania, 1865, portugal, 1867, and, spain, 1888, germany, 1900, and, switzerland, 1912, adopted, their, own, codifications, these, codifications, were, in, turn, imported, into, colonies, at, one, time, or, another, by, most, of, these, countries, the, swiss, version, was, adopted, in, brazil, 1916, and, turkey, 1926, louisiana, is, the, only, u, s, state, whose, private, civil, law, is, based, heavily, on, the, french, and, spanish, codes, as, opposed, to, english, common, law, in, louisiana, private, law, was, codified, into, the, louisiana, civil, code, current, louisiana, law, has, converged, considerably, with, american, law, especially, in, its, public, law, judicial, system, and, adoption, of, the, uniform, commercial, code, except, for, article, 2, and, certain, legal, devices, of, american, common, law, in, fact, any, innovation, whether, private, or, public, has, been, decidedly, common, law, in, origin, in, theory, codes, conceptualized, in, the, civil, law, system, should, go, beyond, the, compilation, of, discrete, statutes, and, instead, state, the, law, in, a, coherent, and, comprehensive, piece, of, legislation, sometimes, introducing, major, reforms, or, starting, anew, in, this, regard, civil, law, codes, are, more, similar, to, the, restatements, of, the, law, the, uniform, commercial, code, which, drew, from, european, inspirations, and, the, model, penal, code, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, u, s, states, began, codification, with, new, york, s, 1850, field, code, laying, down, civil, procedure, rules, and, inspired, by, european, and, louisiana, codes, other, examples, include, california, s, codes, 1872, and, the, federal, revised, statutes, 1874, and, the, current, united, states, code, 1926, which, are, closer, to, compilations, of, statute, than, to, systematic, expositions, of, law, akin, to, civil, law, codes, for, the, legal, system, of, japan, beginning, in, the, meiji, era, european, legal, systems, especially, the, civil, law, of, germany, and, france, were, the, primary, models, for, emulation, in, china, the, german, civil, code, was, introduced, in, the, later, years, of, the, qing, dynasty, emulating, japan, in, addition, it, formed, the, basis, of, the, law, of, the, republic, of, china, which, remains, in, force, in, taiwan, furthermore, taiwan, and, korea, former, japanese, colonies, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, the, japanese, legal, system, civil, law, is, primarily, contrasted, with, the, english, common, law, that, influenced, the, legal, traditions, of, the, english, speaking, countries, the, primary, contrast, between, the, two, systems, is, the, role, of, written, decisions, and, precedent, as, a, source, of, law, one, of, the, defining, features, of, common, law, legal, systems, while, common, law, systems, place, great, weight, on, precedent, civil, law, judges, tend, to, give, less, weight, to, judicial, precedent, for, example, the, napoleonic, code, expressly, forbade, french, judges, to, pronounce, general, principles, of, law, there, is, no, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, in, the, french, civil, law, tradition, there, are, regular, good, quality, law, reports, in, france, but, it, is, not, a, consistent, practice, in, many, of, the, existing, civil, law, jurisdictions, in, french, speaking, colonial, africa, there, were, no, law, reports, and, what, little, we, know, of, those, historical, cases, comes, from, publication, in, journals, civil, law, codes, must, be, changed, constantly, because, the, precedent, of, courts, is, not, binding, and, because, courts, lack, authority, to, act, if, there, is, no, statute, in, some, civil, law, jurisdictions, the, judiciary, does, not, have, the, authority, to, invalidate, legislative, provisions, for, example, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, the, armenian, parliament, with, substantial, support, from, usaid, adopted, new, legal, codes, some, of, the, codes, introduced, problems, which, the, judiciary, was, not, empowered, to, adjudicate, under, the, established, principles, of, the, common, law, of, contracts, they, could, only, apply, the, code, as, written, codification, however, is, by, no, means, a, defining, characteristic, of, a, civil, law, system, for, example, the, statutes, that, govern, the, civil, law, systems, of, sweden, and, other, nordic, countries, and, the, roman, dutch, countries, are, not, grouped, into, larger, expansive, codes, like, those, in, french, and, german, law, in, actual, practice, an, increasing, degree, of, precedent, is, creeping, into, civil, law, jurisprudence, and, is, generally, seen, in, many, nations, highest, courts, some, authors, consider, civil, law, the, foundation, for, socialist, law, used, in, communist, countries, which, in, this, view, would, basically, be, civil, law, with, the, addition, of, marxist, leninist, ideals, even, if, this, is, so, civil, law, was, generally, the, legal, system, in, place, before, the, rise, of, socialist, law, and, some, eastern, european, countries, reverted, to, the, pre, socialist, civil, law, following, the, fall, of, socialism, while, others, continued, using, a, socialist, legal, systems, the, term, civil, law, comes, from, english, legal, scholarship, and, is, used, in, english, speaking, countries, to, lump, together, all, legal, systems, of, the, jus, commune, tradition, however, legal, comparativists, and, economists, promoting, the, legal, origins, theory, prefer, to, subdivide, civil, law, jurisdictions, into, distinct, groups, however, some, of, these, legal, systems, are, often, and, more, correctly, said, to, be, of, hybrid, nature, napoleonic, to, germanistic, influence, the, italian, civil, code, of, 1942, replaced, the, original, one, of, 1865, introducing, german, elements, as, a, result, of, its, world, war, ii, axis, alliance, this, approach, has, been, imitated, by, other, countries, including, portugal, 1966, the, netherlands, 1992, brazil, 2002, and, argentina, 2014, most, of, them, have, innovations, introduced, by, the, italian, legislation, including, the, unification, of, the, civil, and, commercial, codes, germanistic, to, napoleonic, influence, the, swiss, civil, code, is, considered, mainly, influenced, by, the, german, civil, code, and, partly, influenced, by, the, french, civil, code, the, civil, code, of, the, republic, of, turkey, is, a, slightly, modified, version, of, the, swiss, code, adopted, in, 1926, during, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, s, presidency, as, part, of, the, government, s, progressive, reforms, and, secularization, some, systems, of, civil, law, do, not, fit, neatly, into, this, typology, however, polish, law, developed, as, a, mixture, of, french, and, german, civil, law, in, the, 19th, century, after, the, reunification, of, poland, in, 1918, five, legal, systems, french, napoleonic, code, from, the, duchy, of, warsaw, german, bgb, from, western, poland, austrian, abgb, from, southern, poland, russian, law, from, eastern, poland, and, hungarian, law, from, spisz, and, orawa, were, merged, into, one, similarly, dutch, law, while, originally, codified, in, the, napoleonic, tradition, has, been, heavily, altered, under, influence, from, the, dutch, native, tradition, of, roman, dutch, law, still, in, effect, in, its, former, colonies, scotland, s, civil, law, tradition, borrowed, heavily, from, roman, dutch, law, swiss, law, is, categorized, as, germanistic, but, it, has, been, heavily, influenced, by, the, napoleonic, tradition, with, some, indigenous, elements, added, in, as, well, quebec, law, whose, private, law, is, also, of, french, civil, origin, has, developed, along, the, same, lines, adapting, in, the, same, way, as, louisiana, to, the, public, law, and, judicial, system, of, canadian, common, law, by, contrast, quebec, private, law, has, innovated, mainly, from, civil, sources, to, a, lesser, extent, other, states, formerly, part, of, the, spanish, empire, such, as, texas, and, california, have, also, retained, aspects, of, spanish, civil, law, into, their, legal, system, for, example, community, property, the, legal, system, of, puerto, rico, exhibits, similarities, to, that, of, louisiana, a, civil, code, whose, interpretations, rely, on, both, the, civil, and, common, law, systems, because, puerto, rico, s, civil, code, is, based, on, the, spanish, civil, code, of, 1889, available, jurisprudence, has, tended, to, rely, on, common, law, innovations, due, to, the, code, s, age, and, in, many, cases, obsolete, nature, several, islamic, countries, have, civil, law, systems, that, contain, elements, of, islamic, law, as, an, example, the, egyptian, civil, code, of, 1810, that, developed, in, the, early, 19th, century, which, remains, in, force, in, egypt, is, the, basis, for, the, civil, law, in, many, countries, of, the, arab, world, where, the, civil, law, is, used, is, based, on, the, napoleonic, code, but, its, primary, author, abd, el, razzak, el, sanhuri, attempted, to, integrate, principles, and, features, of, islamic, law, in, deference, to, the, unique, circumstances, of, egyptian, society, japanese, civil, code, is, considered, a, mixture, drawing, roughly, 60, from, the, german, civil, code, roughly, 30, from, the, french, civil, code, 8, from, japanese, customary, law, and, 2, from, english, law, regarding, the, latter, the, code, borrows, the, doctrine, of, ultra, vires, and, the, precedent, of, hadley, v, baxendale, from, english, common, law, system, some, countries, where, civil, law, is, practiced, includes
