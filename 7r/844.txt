a, social, class, or, social, stratum, is, a, grouping, of, people, into, a, set, of, hierarchical, social, categories, the, most, common, being, the, working, class, middle, class, and, upper, class, membership, of, a, social, class, can, for, example, be, dependent, on, education, wealth, occupation, income, and, belonging, to, a, particular, subculture, or, social, network, class, is, a, subject, of, analysis, for, sociologists, political, scientists, anthropologists, and, social, historians, the, term, has, a, wide, range, of, sometimes, conflicting, meanings, and, there, is, no, broad, consensus, on, a, definition, of, class, some, people, argue, that, due, to, social, mobility, class, boundaries, do, not, exist, in, common, parlance, the, term, social, class, is, usually, synonymous, with, socioeconomic, class, defined, as, people, having, the, same, social, economic, cultural, political, or, educational, status, e, g, the, working, class, an, emerging, professional, class, etc, however, academics, distinguish, social, class, from, socioeconomic, status, using, the, former, to, refer, to, one, s, relatively, stable, cultural, background, and, the, latter, to, refer, to, one, s, current, social, and, economic, situation, which, is, consequently, more, changeable, over, time, the, precise, measurements, of, what, determines, social, class, in, society, have, varied, over, time, karl, marx, defined, class, by, one, s, relationship, to, the, means, of, production, their, relations, of, production, his, understanding, of, classes, in, modern, capitalist, society, is, that, the, proletariat, work, but, do, not, own, the, means, of, production, and, the, bourgeoisie, those, who, invest, and, live, off, the, surplus, generated, by, the, proletariat, s, operation, of, the, means, of, production, do, not, work, at, all, this, contrasts, with, the, view, of, the, sociologist, max, weber, who, contrasted, class, as, determined, by, economic, position, with, social, status, stand, which, is, determined, by, social, prestige, rather, than, simply, just, relations, of, production, the, term, class, is, etymologically, derived, from, the, latin, classis, which, was, used, by, census, takers, to, categorize, citizens, by, wealth, in, order, to, determine, military, service, obligations, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, term, class, began, to, replace, classifications, such, as, estates, rank, and, orders, as, the, primary, means, of, organizing, society, into, hierarchical, divisions, this, corresponded, to, a, general, decrease, in, significance, ascribed, to, hereditary, characteristics, and, increase, in, the, significance, of, wealth, and, income, as, indicators, of, position, in, the, social, hierarchy, the, existence, of, social, classes, is, considered, normal, in, many, societies, both, historic, and, modern, to, varying, degrees, it, is, important, to, note, that, not, all, systems, that, have, social, classes, are, the, same, rather, they, can, vary, to, each, other, in, substantial, ways, that, reflect, the, respective, cultures, of, said, societies, at, times, even, only, having, the, shared, creation, of, social, class, in, common, the, existence, of, a, class, system, dates, back, to, times, of, ancient, egypt, where, the, position, of, elite, was, also, characterized, by, literacy, the, wealthier, people, were, at, the, top, in, the, social, order, and, common, people, and, slaves, being, at, the, bottom, however, the, class, was, not, rigid, a, man, of, humble, origins, could, ascend, to, a, high, post, 38, the, ancient, egyptians, viewed, men, and, women, including, people, from, all, social, classes, as, essentially, equal, under, the, law, and, even, the, lowliest, peasant, was, entitled, to, petition, the, vizier, and, his, court, for, redress, farmers, made, up, the, bulk, of, the, population, but, agricultural, produce, was, owned, directly, by, the, state, temple, or, noble, family, that, owned, the, land, 383, farmers, were, also, subject, to, a, labor, tax, and, were, required, to, work, on, irrigation, or, construction, projects, in, a, corv, e, system, 136, artists, and, craftsmen, were, of, higher, status, than, farmers, but, they, were, also, under, state, control, working, in, the, shops, attached, to, the, temples, and, paid, directly, from, the, state, treasury, scribes, and, officials, formed, the, upper, class, in, ancient, egypt, known, as, the, white, kilt, class, in, reference, to, the, bleached, linen, garments, that, served, as, a, mark, of, their, rank, 109, the, upper, class, prominently, displayed, their, social, status, in, art, and, literature, below, the, nobility, were, the, priests, physicians, and, engineers, with, specialized, training, in, their, field, it, is, unclear, whether, slavery, as, understood, today, existed, in, ancient, egypt, there, is, difference, of, opinions, among, authors, not, a, single, egyptian, was, in, our, sense, of, the, word, free, no, individual, could, call, in, question, a, hierarchy, of, authority, which, culminated, in, a, living, god, although, slaves, were, mostly, used, as, indentured, servants, they, were, able, to, buy, and, sell, their, servitude, work, their, way, to, freedom, or, nobility, and, were, usually, treated, by, doctors, in, the, workplace, in, ancient, greece, when, the, clan, system, was, declining, the, classes, replaced, the, clan, society, when, it, became, too, small, to, sustain, the, needs, of, increasing, population, the, division, of, labor, is, also, essential, for, the, growth, of, classes, 39, historically, social, class, and, behavior, were, laid, down, in, law, for, example, permitted, mode, of, dress, in, some, times, and, places, was, strictly, regulated, with, sumptuous, dressing, only, for, the, high, ranks, of, society, and, aristocracy, whereas, sumptuary, laws, stipulated, the, dress, and, jewelry, appropriate, for, a, person, s, social, rank, and, station, in, europe, these, laws, became, increasingly, commonplace, during, the, middle, ages, however, these, laws, were, prone, to, change, due, to, societal, changes, and, in, many, cases, these, distinctions, may, either, almost, disappear, such, as, the, distinction, between, a, patrician, and, a, plebeian, being, almost, erased, during, the, late, roman, republic, jean, jacques, rousseau, had, a, large, influence, over, political, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, because, of, his, views, of, inequality, and, classes, rousseau, saw, humans, as, naturally, pure, and, good, meaning, that, humans, from, birth, were, seen, as, innocent, and, any, evilness, was, learned, he, believed, that, social, problems, arise, through, the, development, of, society, and, suppress, the, innate, pureness, of, humankind, he, also, believed, that, private, property, is, the, main, reason, for, social, issues, in, society, because, private, property, creates, inequality, through, the, property, s, value, even, though, his, theory, predicted, if, there, were, no, private, property, then, there, would, be, wide, spread, equality, rousseau, accepted, that, there, will, always, be, social, inequality, because, of, how, society, is, viewed, and, run, later, enlightenment, thinkers, viewed, inequality, as, valuable, and, crucial, to, society, s, development, and, prosperity, they, also, acknowledged, that, private, property, will, ultimately, cause, inequality, because, specific, resources, that, are, privately, owned, can, be, stored, and, the, owners, profit, off, of, the, deficit, of, the, resource, this, can, create, competition, between, the, classes, that, was, seen, as, necessary, by, these, thinkers, this, also, creates, stratification, between, the, classes, keeping, a, distinct, difference, between, lower, poorer, classes, and, the, higher, wealthier, classes, india, nepal, north, korea, sri, lanka, and, some, indigenous, peoples, maintain, social, classes, today, in, class, societies, class, conflict, has, tended, to, recur, or, is, ongoing, depending, on, the, sociological, and, anthropolitical, perspective, class, societies, have, not, always, existed, there, have, been, widely, different, types, of, class, communities, for, example, societies, based, on, age, rather, than, capital, during, colonialism, social, relations, were, dismantled, by, force, which, gave, rise, to, societies, based, on, the, social, categories, of, waged, labor, private, property, and, capital, class, society, or, class, based, society, is, an, organizing, principle, society, in, which, ownership, of, property, means, of, production, and, wealth, is, the, determining, factor, of, the, distribution, of, power, in, which, those, with, more, property, and, wealth, are, stratified, higher, in, the, society, and, those, without, access, to, the, means, of, production, and, without, wealth, are, stratified, lower, in, the, society, in, a, class, society, at, least, implicitly, people, are, divided, into, distinct, social, strata, commonly, referred, to, as, social, classes, or, castes, the, nature, of, class, society, is, a, matter, of, sociological, research, class, societies, exist, all, over, the, globe, in, both, industrialized, and, developing, nations, class, stratification, is, theorized, to, come, directly, from, capitalism, in, terms, of, public, opinion, nine, out, of, ten, people, in, a, swedish, survey, considered, it, correct, that, they, are, living, in, a, class, society, one, may, use, comparative, methods, to, study, class, societies, using, for, example, comparison, of, gini, coefficients, de, facto, educational, opportunities, unemployment, and, culture, societies, with, large, class, differences, have, a, greater, proportion, of, people, who, suffer, from, mental, health, issues, such, as, anxiety, and, depression, symptoms, a, series, of, scientific, studies, have, demonstrated, this, relationship, statistics, support, this, assertion, and, results, are, found, in, life, expectancy, and, overall, health, for, example, in, the, case, of, high, differences, in, life, expectancy, between, two, stockholm, suburbs, the, differences, between, life, expectancy, of, the, poor, and, less, well, educated, inhabitants, who, live, in, proximity, to, the, station, v, rby, g, rd, and, the, highly, educated, and, more, affluent, inhabitants, living, near, danderyd, differ, by, 18, years, similar, data, about, new, york, is, also, available, for, life, expectancy, average, income, per, capita, income, distribution, median, income, mobility, for, people, who, grew, up, poor, share, with, a, bachelor, s, degree, or, higher, in, class, societies, the, lower, classes, systematically, receive, lower, quality, education, and, care, there, are, more, explicit, effects, where, those, within, the, higher, class, actively, demonize, parts, of, the, lower, class, population, definitions, of, social, classes, reflect, a, number, of, sociological, perspectives, informed, by, anthropology, economics, psychology, and, sociology, the, major, perspectives, historically, have, been, marxism, and, structural, functionalism, the, common, stratum, model, of, class, divides, society, into, a, simple, hierarchy, of, working, class, middle, class, and, upper, class, within, academia, two, broad, schools, of, definitions, emerge, those, aligned, with, 20th, century, sociological, stratum, models, of, class, society, and, those, aligned, with, the, 19th, century, historical, materialist, economic, models, of, the, marxists, and, anarchists, another, distinction, can, be, drawn, between, analytical, concepts, of, social, class, such, as, the, marxist, and, weberian, traditions, as, well, as, the, more, empirical, traditions, such, as, socioeconomic, status, approach, which, notes, the, correlation, of, income, education, and, wealth, with, social, outcomes, without, necessarily, implying, a, particular, theory, of, social, structure, large, groups, of, people, differing, from, each, other, by, the, place, they, occupy, in, a, historically, determined, system, of, social, production, by, their, relation, in, most, cases, fixed, and, formulated, in, law, to, the, means, of, production, by, their, role, in, the, social, organization, of, labor, and, consequently, by, the, dimensions, of, the, share, of, social, wealth, of, which, they, dispose, and, the, mode, of, acquiring, it, vladimir, lenin, a, great, beginning, on, june, 1919, for, marx, class, is, a, combination, of, objective, and, subjective, factors, objectively, a, class, shares, a, common, relationship, to, the, means, of, production, the, class, society, itself, is, understood, as, the, aggregated, phenomenon, to, the, interlinked, movement, which, generates, the, quasi, objective, concept, of, capital, subjectively, the, members, will, necessarily, have, some, perception, class, consciousness, of, their, similarity, and, common, interest, class, consciousness, is, not, simply, an, awareness, of, one, s, own, class, interest, but, is, also, a, set, of, shared, views, regarding, how, society, should, be, organized, legally, culturally, socially, and, politically, these, class, relations, are, reproduced, through, time, in, marxist, theory, the, class, structure, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, is, characterized, by, the, conflict, between, two, main, classes, the, bourgeoisie, the, capitalists, who, own, the, means, of, production, and, the, much, larger, proletariat, or, working, class, who, must, sell, their, own, labour, power, wage, labour, this, is, the, fundamental, economic, structure, of, work, and, property, a, state, of, inequality, that, is, normalized, and, reproduced, through, cultural, ideology, for, marxists, every, person, in, the, process, of, production, has, separate, social, relationships, and, issues, along, with, this, every, person, is, placed, into, different, groups, that, have, similar, interests, and, values, that, can, differ, drastically, from, group, to, group, class, is, special, in, that, does, not, relate, to, specifically, to, a, singular, person, but, to, a, specific, role, marxists, explain, the, history, of, civilized, societies, in, terms, of, a, war, of, classes, between, those, who, control, production, and, those, who, produce, the, goods, or, services, in, society, in, the, marxist, view, of, capitalism, this, is, a, conflict, between, capitalists, bourgeoisie, and, wage, workers, the, proletariat, for, marxists, class, antagonism, is, rooted, in, the, situation, that, control, over, social, production, necessarily, entails, control, over, the, class, which, produces, goods, in, capitalism, this, is, the, exploitation, of, workers, by, the, bourgeoisie, furthermore, in, countries, where, modern, civilisation, has, become, fully, developed, a, new, class, of, petty, bourgeois, has, been, formed, an, industrial, army, of, workmen, under, the, command, of, a, capitalist, requires, like, a, real, army, officers, managers, and, sergeants, foremen, over, lookers, who, while, the, work, is, being, done, command, in, the, name, of, the, capitalist, marx, makes, the, argument, that, as, the, bourgeoisie, reach, a, point, of, wealth, accumulation, they, hold, enough, power, as, the, dominant, class, to, shape, political, institutions, and, society, according, to, their, own, interests, marx, then, goes, on, to, claim, that, the, non, elite, class, owing, to, their, large, numbers, have, the, power, to, overthrow, the, elite, and, create, an, equal, society, in, the, communist, manifesto, marx, himself, argued, that, it, was, the, goal, of, the, proletariat, itself, to, displace, the, capitalist, system, with, socialism, changing, the, social, relationships, underpinning, the, class, system, and, then, developing, into, a, future, communist, society, in, which, the, free, development, of, each, is, the, condition, for, the, free, development, of, all, this, would, mark, the, beginning, of, a, classless, society, in, which, human, needs, rather, than, profit, would, be, motive, for, production, in, a, society, with, democratic, control, and, production, for, use, there, would, be, no, class, no, state, and, no, need, for, financial, and, banking, institutions, and, money, these, theorists, have, taken, this, binary, class, system, and, expanded, it, to, include, contradictory, class, locations, the, idea, that, a, person, can, be, employed, in, many, different, class, locations, that, fall, between, the, two, classes, of, proletariat, and, bourgeoisie, erik, olin, wright, stated, that, class, definitions, are, more, diverse, and, elaborate, through, identifying, with, multiple, classes, having, familial, ties, with, people, in, different, a, class, or, having, a, temporary, leadership, role, max, weber, formulated, a, three, component, theory, of, stratification, that, saw, social, class, as, emerging, from, an, interplay, between, class, status, and, power, weber, believed, that, class, position, was, determined, by, a, person, s, relationship, to, the, means, of, production, while, status, or, stand, emerged, from, estimations, of, honor, or, prestige, weber, views, class, as, a, group, of, people, who, have, common, goals, and, opportunities, that, are, available, to, them, this, means, that, what, separates, each, class, from, each, other, is, their, value, in, the, marketplace, through, their, own, goods, and, services, this, creates, a, divide, between, the, classes, through, the, assets, that, they, have, such, as, property, and, expertise, weber, derived, many, of, his, key, concepts, on, social, stratification, by, examining, the, social, structure, of, many, countries, he, noted, that, contrary, to, marx, s, theories, stratification, was, based, on, more, than, simply, ownership, of, capital, weber, pointed, out, that, some, members, of, the, aristocracy, lack, economic, wealth, yet, might, nevertheless, have, political, power, likewise, in, europe, many, wealthy, jewish, families, lacked, prestige, and, honor, because, they, were, considered, members, of, a, pariah, group, for, bourdieu, the, place, in, the, social, strata, for, any, person, is, vaguer, than, the, equivalent, in, weberian, sociology, bourdieu, introduced, an, array, of, concepts, of, what, he, refers, to, as, types, of, capital, these, types, were, economic, capital, in, the, form, assets, convertible, to, money, and, secured, as, private, property, this, type, of, capital, is, separated, from, the, other, types, of, culturally, constituted, types, of, capital, which, bourdieu, introduces, which, are, personal, cultural, capital, formal, education, knowledge, objective, cultural, capital, books, art, and, institutionalized, cultural, capital, honours, and, titles, on, 2, april, 2013, the, results, of, a, survey, conducted, by, bbc, lab, uk, developed, in, collaboration, with, academic, experts, and, slated, to, be, published, in, the, journal, sociology, were, published, online, the, results, released, were, based, on, a, survey, of, 160, 000, residents, of, the, united, kingdom, most, of, whom, lived, in, england, and, described, themselves, as, white, class, was, defined, and, measured, according, to, the, amount, and, kind, of, economic, cultural, and, social, resources, reported, economic, capital, was, defined, as, income, and, assets, cultural, capital, as, amount, and, type, of, cultural, interests, and, activities, and, social, capital, as, the, quantity, and, social, status, of, their, friends, family, and, personal, and, business, contacts, this, theoretical, framework, was, developed, by, pierre, bourdieu, who, first, published, his, theory, of, social, distinction, in, 1979, today, concepts, of, social, class, often, assume, three, general, economic, categories, a, very, wealthy, and, powerful, upper, class, that, owns, and, controls, the, means, of, production, a, middle, class, of, professional, workers, small, business, owners, and, low, level, managers, and, a, lower, class, who, rely, on, low, paying, jobs, for, their, livelihood, and, experience, poverty, the, upper, class, is, the, social, class, composed, of, those, who, are, rich, well, born, powerful, or, a, combination, of, those, they, usually, wield, the, greatest, political, power, in, some, countries, wealth, alone, is, sufficient, to, allow, entry, into, the, upper, class, in, others, only, people, who, are, born, or, marry, into, certain, aristocratic, bloodlines, are, considered, members, of, the, upper, class, and, those, who, gain, great, wealth, through, commercial, activity, are, looked, down, upon, by, the, aristocracy, as, nouveau, riche, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, the, upper, classes, are, the, aristocracy, and, royalty, with, wealth, playing, a, less, important, role, in, class, status, many, aristocratic, peerages, or, titles, have, seats, attached, to, them, with, the, holder, of, the, title, e, g, earl, of, bristol, and, his, family, being, the, custodians, of, the, house, but, not, the, owners, many, of, these, require, high, expenditures, so, wealth, is, typically, needed, many, aristocratic, peerages, and, their, homes, are, parts, of, estates, owned, and, run, by, the, title, holder, with, moneys, generated, by, the, land, rents, or, other, sources, of, wealth, however, in, the, united, states, where, there, is, no, aristocracy, or, royalty, the, upper, class, status, exclusive, of, americans, of, ancestral, wealth, or, patricians, of, european, ancestry, is, referred, to, in, the, media, as, the, extremely, wealthy, the, so, called, super, rich, though, there, is, some, tendency, even, in, the, united, states, for, those, with, old, family, wealth, to, look, down, on, those, who, have, accrued, their, money, through, business, the, struggle, between, new, money, and, old, money, the, upper, class, is, generally, contained, within, the, richest, one, or, two, percent, of, the, population, members, of, the, upper, class, are, often, born, into, it, and, are, distinguished, by, immense, wealth, which, is, passed, from, generation, to, generation, in, the, form, of, estates, based, on, some, new, social, and, political, theories, upper, class, consists, of, the, most, wealthy, decile, group, in, society, which, holds, nearly, 87, of, the, whole, society, s, wealth, see, also, middle, class, squeeze, the, middle, class, is, the, most, contested, of, the, three, categories, the, broad, group, of, people, in, contemporary, society, who, fall, socio, economically, between, the, lower, and, upper, classes, one, example, of, the, contest, of, this, term, is, that, in, the, united, states, middle, class, is, applied, very, broadly, and, includes, people, who, would, elsewhere, be, considered, working, class, middle, class, workers, are, sometimes, called, white, collar, workers, theorists, such, as, ralf, dahrendorf, have, noted, the, tendency, toward, an, enlarged, middle, class, in, modern, western, societies, particularly, in, relation, to, the, necessity, of, an, educated, work, force, in, technological, economies, perspectives, concerning, globalization, and, neocolonialism, such, as, dependency, theory, suggest, this, is, due, to, the, shift, of, low, level, labour, to, developing, nations, and, the, third, world, middle, class, is, the, group, of, people, with, jobs, that, pay, significantly, more, than, the, poverty, line, examples, of, these, types, of, jobs, are, factory, workers, salesperson, teacher, cooks, and, nurses, there, is, a, new, trend, by, some, scholars, which, assumes, that, the, size, of, the, middle, class, in, every, society, is, the, same, for, example, in, paradox, of, interest, theory, middle, class, are, those, who, are, in, 6th, 9th, decile, groups, which, hold, nearly, 12, of, the, whole, society, s, wealth, lower, class, occasionally, described, as, working, class, are, those, employed, in, low, paying, wage, jobs, with, very, little, economic, security, the, term, lower, class, also, refers, to, persons, with, low, income, the, working, class, is, sometimes, separated, into, those, who, are, employed, but, lacking, financial, security, the, working, poor, and, an, underclass, those, who, are, long, term, unemployed, and, or, homeless, especially, those, receiving, welfare, from, the, state, the, latter, is, today, considered, analogous, to, the, marxist, term, lumpenproletariat, however, during, the, time, of, marx, s, writing, the, lumpenproletariat, referred, to, those, in, dire, poverty, such, as, the, homeless, members, of, the, working, class, are, sometimes, called, blue, collar, workers, a, person, s, socioeconomic, class, has, wide, ranging, effects, it, can, determine, the, schools, they, are, able, to, attend, their, health, the, jobs, open, to, them, when, they, exit, the, labour, market, whom, they, may, marry, and, their, treatment, by, police, and, the, courts, angus, deaton, and, anne, case, have, analyzed, the, mortality, rates, related, to, the, group, of, white, middle, aged, americans, between, the, ages, of, 45, and, 54, and, its, relation, to, class, there, has, been, a, growing, number, of, suicides, and, deaths, by, substance, abuse, in, this, particular, group, of, middle, class, americans, this, group, also, has, been, recorded, to, have, an, increase, in, reports, of, chronic, pain, and, poor, general, health, deaton, and, case, came, to, the, conclusion, from, these, observations, that, because, of, the, constant, stress, that, these, white, middle, aged, americans, feel, fighting, poverty, and, wavering, between, the, middle, and, lower, classes, these, strains, have, taken, a, toll, on, these, people, and, affected, their, whole, bodies, social, classifications, can, also, determine, the, sporting, activities, that, such, classes, take, part, in, it, is, suggested, that, those, of, an, upper, social, class, are, more, likely, to, take, part, in, sporting, activities, whereas, those, of, a, lower, social, background, are, less, likely, to, participate, in, sport, however, upper, class, people, tend, to, not, take, part, in, certain, sports, that, have, been, commonly, known, to, be, linked, with, the, lower, class, a, person, s, social, class, has, a, significant, effect, on, their, educational, opportunities, not, only, are, upper, class, parents, able, to, send, their, children, to, exclusive, schools, that, are, perceived, to, be, better, but, in, many, places, state, supported, schools, for, children, of, the, upper, class, are, of, a, much, higher, quality, than, those, the, state, provides, for, children, of, the, lower, classes, this, lack, of, good, schools, is, one, factor, that, perpetuates, the, class, divide, across, generations, in, the, uk, the, educational, consequences, of, class, position, have, been, discussed, by, scholars, inspired, by, the, cultural, studies, framework, of, the, cccs, and, or, especially, regarding, working, class, girls, feminist, theory, on, working, class, boys, paul, willis, 1977, book, learning, to, labour, how, working, class, kids, get, working, class, jobs, is, seen, within, the, british, cultural,
