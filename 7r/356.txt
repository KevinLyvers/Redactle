the, austroasiatic, languages, s, t, r, o, e, i, t, k, oss, troh, ay, zhee, at, ik, awss, are, a, large, language, family, spoken, throughout, mainland, southeast, asia, south, asia, and, east, asia, these, languages, are, natively, spoken, by, the, majority, of, the, population, in, vietnam, and, cambodia, and, by, minority, populations, scattered, throughout, parts, of, thailand, laos, india, myanmar, malaysia, bangladesh, nepal, and, southern, china, approximately, 117, million, people, speak, an, austroasiatic, language, of, which, more, than, two, thirds, are, vietnamese, speakers, of, the, austroasiatic, languages, only, vietnamese, khmer, and, mon, have, lengthy, established, presences, in, the, historical, record, only, two, are, presently, considered, to, be, the, national, languages, of, sovereign, states, vietnamese, in, vietnam, and, khmer, in, cambodia, the, mon, language, is, a, recognized, indigenous, language, in, myanmar, and, thailand, while, the, wa, language, is, a, recognized, national, language, in, the, de, facto, autonomous, wa, state, within, myanmar, santali, is, one, of, the, 22, scheduled, languages, of, india, the, remainder, of, the, family, s, languages, are, spoken, by, minority, groups, and, have, no, official, status, ethnologue, identifies, 168, austroasiatic, languages, these, form, thirteen, established, families, plus, perhaps, shompen, which, is, poorly, attested, as, a, fourteenth, which, have, traditionally, been, grouped, into, two, as, mon, khmer, and, munda, however, one, recent, classification, posits, three, groups, munda, mon, khmer, and, khasi, khmuic, while, another, has, abandoned, mon, khmer, as, a, taxon, altogether, making, it, synonymous, with, the, larger, family, austroasiatic, languages, appear, to, be, the, extant, autochthonous, languages, in, mainland, southeast, asia, with, the, neighboring, kra, dai, hmong, mien, austronesian, and, sino, tibetan, languages, having, arrived, via, later, migrations, the, name, austroasiatic, was, coined, by, wilhelm, schmidt, german, austroasiatisch, based, on, auster, the, latin, word, for, south, but, idiosyncratically, used, by, schmidt, to, refer, to, the, southeast, and, asia, despite, the, literal, meaning, of, its, name, only, three, austroasiatic, branches, are, actually, spoken, in, south, asia, khasic, munda, and, nicobarese, regarding, word, structure, austroasiatic, languages, are, well, known, for, having, an, iambic, sesquisyllabic, pattern, with, basic, nouns, and, verbs, consisting, of, an, initial, unstressed, reduced, minor, syllable, followed, by, a, stressed, full, syllable, this, reduction, of, presyllables, has, led, to, a, variety, of, phonological, shapes, of, the, same, original, proto, austroasiatic, prefixes, such, as, the, causative, prefix, ranging, from, cvc, syllables, to, consonant, clusters, to, single, consonants, among, the, modern, languages, as, for, word, formation, most, austroasiatic, languages, have, a, variety, of, derivational, prefixes, many, have, infixes, but, suffixes, are, almost, completely, non, existent, in, most, branches, except, munda, and, a, few, specialized, exceptions, in, other, austroasiatic, branches, the, austroasiatic, languages, are, further, characterized, as, having, unusually, large, vowel, inventories, and, employing, some, sort, of, register, contrast, either, between, modal, normal, voice, and, breathy, lax, voice, or, between, modal, voice, and, creaky, voice, languages, in, the, pearic, branch, and, some, in, the, vietic, branch, can, have, a, three, or, even, four, way, voicing, contrast, however, some, austroasiatic, languages, have, lost, the, register, contrast, by, evolving, more, diphthongs, or, in, a, few, cases, such, as, vietnamese, tonogenesis, vietnamese, has, been, so, heavily, influenced, by, chinese, that, its, original, austroasiatic, phonological, quality, is, obscured, and, now, resembles, that, of, south, chinese, languages, whereas, khmer, which, had, more, influence, from, sanskrit, has, retained, a, more, typically, austroasiatic, structure, much, work, has, been, done, on, the, reconstruction, of, proto, mon, khmer, in, harry, l, shorto, s, mon, khmer, comparative, dictionary, little, work, has, been, done, on, the, munda, languages, which, are, not, well, documented, with, their, demotion, from, a, primary, branch, proto, mon, khmer, becomes, synonymous, with, proto, austroasiatic, paul, sidwell, 2005, reconstructs, the, consonant, inventory, of, proto, mon, khmer, as, follows, this, is, identical, to, earlier, reconstructions, except, for, is, better, preserved, in, the, katuic, languages, which, sidwell, has, specialized, in, linguists, traditionally, recognize, two, primary, divisions, of, austroasiatic, the, mon, khmer, languages, of, southeast, asia, northeast, india, and, the, nicobar, islands, and, the, munda, languages, of, east, and, central, india, and, parts, of, bangladesh, and, nepal, however, no, evidence, for, this, classification, has, ever, been, published, each, of, the, families, that, is, written, in, boldface, type, below, is, accepted, as, a, valid, clade, by, contrast, the, relationships, between, these, families, within, austroasiatic, are, debated, in, addition, to, the, traditional, classification, two, recent, proposals, are, given, neither, of, which, accepts, traditional, mon, khmer, as, a, valid, unit, however, little, of, the, data, used, for, competing, classifications, has, ever, been, published, and, therefore, cannot, be, evaluated, by, peer, review, in, addition, there, are, suggestions, that, additional, branches, of, austroasiatic, might, be, preserved, in, substrata, of, acehnese, in, sumatra, diffloth, the, chamic, languages, of, vietnam, and, the, land, dayak, languages, of, borneo, adelaar, 1995, diffloth, s, widely, cited, original, classification, now, abandoned, by, diffloth, himself, is, used, in, encyclop, dia, britannica, and, except, for, the, breakup, of, southern, mon, khmer, in, ethnologue, peiros, is, a, lexicostatistic, classification, based, on, percentages, of, shared, vocabulary, this, means, that, languages, can, appear, to, be, more, distantly, related, than, they, actually, are, due, to, language, contact, indeed, when, sidwell, 2009, replicated, peiros, s, study, with, languages, known, well, enough, to, account, for, loans, he, did, not, find, the, internal, branching, structure, below, diffloth, compares, reconstructions, of, various, clades, and, attempts, to, classify, them, based, on, shared, innovations, though, like, other, classifications, the, evidence, has, not, been, published, as, a, schematic, we, have, remo, savara, kharia, juang, korku, kherwarian, khmuic, pakanic, palaungic, khasian, vietic, katuic, bahnaric, khmer, pearic, nicobarese, aslian, monic, or, in, more, detail, paul, sidwell, 2009, in, a, lexicostatistical, comparison, of, 36, languages, which, are, well, known, enough, to, exclude, loanwords, finds, little, evidence, for, internal, branching, though, he, did, find, an, area, of, increased, contact, between, the, bahnaric, and, katuic, languages, such, that, languages, of, all, branches, apart, from, the, geographically, distant, munda, and, nicobarese, show, greater, similarity, to, bahnaric, and, katuic, the, closer, they, are, to, those, branches, without, any, noticeable, innovations, common, to, bahnaric, and, katuic, he, therefore, takes, the, conservative, view, that, the, thirteen, branches, of, austroasiatic, should, be, treated, as, equidistant, on, current, evidence, sidwell, blench, 2011, discuss, this, proposal, in, more, detail, and, note, that, there, is, good, evidence, for, a, khasi, palaungic, node, which, could, also, possibly, be, closely, related, to, khmuic, if, this, would, the, case, sidwell, blench, suggest, that, khasic, may, have, been, an, early, offshoot, of, palaungic, that, had, spread, westward, sidwell, blench, 2011, suggest, shompen, as, an, additional, branch, and, believe, that, a, vieto, katuic, connection, is, worth, investigating, in, general, however, the, family, is, thought, to, have, diversified, too, quickly, for, a, deeply, nested, structure, to, have, developed, since, proto, austroasiatic, speakers, are, believed, by, sidwell, to, have, radiated, out, from, the, central, mekong, river, valley, relatively, quickly, subsequently, sidwell, 2015a, 179, proposed, that, nicobarese, subgroups, with, aslian, just, as, how, khasian, and, palaungic, subgroup, with, each, other, munda, khasian, palaungic, khmuic, mang, pakanic, vietic, katuic, bahnaric, khmer, pearic, monic, aslian, nicobarese, shompen, a, subsequent, computational, phylogenetic, analysis, sidwell, 2015b, suggests, that, austroasiatic, branches, may, have, a, loosely, nested, structure, rather, than, a, completely, rake, like, structure, with, an, east, west, division, consisting, of, munda, khasic, palaungic, and, khmuic, forming, a, western, group, as, opposed, to, all, of, the, other, branches, occurring, possibly, as, early, as, 7, 000, years, before, present, however, he, still, considers, the, subbranching, dubious, integrating, computational, phylogenetic, linguistics, with, recent, archaeological, findings, paul, sidwell, 2015c, further, expanded, his, mekong, riverine, hypothesis, by, proposing, that, austroasiatic, had, ultimately, expanded, into, indochina, from, the, lingnan, area, of, southern, china, with, the, subsequent, mekong, riverine, dispersal, taking, place, after, the, initial, arrival, of, neolithic, farmers, from, southern, china, sidwell, 2015c, tentatively, suggests, that, austroasiatic, may, have, begun, to, split, up, 5, 000, years, b, p, during, the, neolithic, transition, era, of, mainland, southeast, asia, with, all, the, major, branches, of, austroasiatic, formed, by, 4, 000, b, p, austroasiatic, would, have, had, two, possible, dispersal, routes, from, the, western, periphery, of, the, pearl, river, watershed, of, lingnan, which, would, have, been, either, a, coastal, route, down, the, coast, of, vietnam, or, downstream, through, the, mekong, river, via, yunnan, both, the, reconstructed, lexicon, of, proto, austroasiatic, and, the, archaeological, record, clearly, show, that, early, austroasiatic, speakers, around, 4, 000, b, p, cultivated, rice, and, millet, kept, livestock, such, as, dogs, pigs, and, chickens, and, thrived, mostly, in, estuarine, rather, than, coastal, environments, at, 4, 500, b, p, this, neolithic, package, suddenly, arrived, in, indochina, from, the, lingnan, area, without, cereal, grains, and, displaced, the, earlier, pre, neolithic, hunter, gatherer, cultures, with, grain, husks, found, in, northern, indochina, by, 4, 100, b, p, and, in, southern, indochina, by, 3, 800, b, p, however, sidwell, 2015c, found, that, iron, is, not, reconstructable, in, proto, austroasiatic, since, each, austroasiatic, branch, has, different, terms, for, iron, that, had, been, borrowed, relatively, lately, from, tai, chinese, tibetan, malay, and, other, languages, during, the, iron, age, about, 2, 500, b, p, relatively, young, austroasiatic, branches, in, indochina, such, as, vietic, katuic, pearic, and, khmer, were, formed, while, the, more, internally, diverse, bahnaric, branch, dating, to, about, 3, 000, b, p, underwent, more, extensive, internal, diversification, by, the, iron, age, all, of, the, austroasiatic, branches, were, more, or, less, in, their, present, day, locations, with, most, of, the, diversification, within, austroasiatic, taking, place, during, the, iron, age, paul, sidwell, 2018, considers, the, austroasiatic, language, family, to, have, rapidly, diversified, around, 4, 000, years, b, p, during, the, arrival, of, rice, agriculture, in, indochina, but, notes, that, the, origin, of, proto, austroasiatic, itself, is, older, than, that, date, the, lexicon, of, proto, austroasiatic, can, be, divided, into, an, early, and, late, stratum, the, early, stratum, consists, of, basic, lexicon, including, body, parts, animal, names, natural, features, and, pronouns, while, the, names, of, cultural, items, agriculture, terms, and, words, for, cultural, artifacts, which, are, reconstructible, in, proto, austroasiatic, form, part, of, the, later, stratum, roger, blench, 2017, suggests, that, vocabulary, related, to, aquatic, subsistence, strategies, such, as, boats, waterways, river, fauna, and, fish, capture, techniques, can, be, reconstructed, for, proto, austroasiatic, blench, 2017, finds, widespread, austroasiatic, roots, for, river, valley, boat, fish, catfish, sp, eel, prawn, shrimp, central, austroasiatic, crab, tortoise, turtle, otter, crocodile, heron, fishing, bird, and, fish, trap, archaeological, evidence, for, the, presence, of, agriculture, in, northern, indochina, northern, vietnam, laos, and, other, nearby, areas, dates, back, to, only, about, 4, 000, years, ago, 2, 000, bc, with, agriculture, ultimately, being, introduced, from, further, up, to, the, north, in, the, yangtze, valley, where, it, has, been, dated, to, 6, 000, b, p, sidwell, 2022, proposes, that, the, locus, of, proto, austroasiatic, was, in, the, red, river, delta, area, about, 4, 000, 4, 500, years, before, present, instead, of, the, middle, mekong, as, he, had, previously, proposed, austroasiatic, dispersed, coastal, maritime, routes, and, also, upstream, through, river, valleys, khmuic, palaungic, and, khasic, resulted, from, a, westward, dispersal, that, ultimately, came, from, the, red, valley, valley, based, on, their, current, distributions, about, half, of, all, austroasiatic, branches, including, nicobaric, and, munda, can, be, traced, to, coastal, maritime, dispersals, hence, this, points, to, a, relatively, late, riverine, dispersal, of, austroasiatic, as, compared, to, sino, tibetan, whose, speakers, had, a, distinct, non, riverine, culture, in, addition, to, living, an, aquatic, based, lifestyle, early, austroasiatic, speakers, would, have, also, had, access, to, livestock, crops, and, newer, types, of, watercraft, as, early, austroasiatic, speakers, dispersed, rapidly, via, waterways, they, would, have, encountered, speakers, of, older, language, families, who, were, already, settled, in, the, area, such, as, sino, tibetan, sidwell, 2018, quoted, in, sidwell, 2021, gives, a, more, nested, classification, of, austroasiatic, branches, as, suggested, by, his, computational, phylogenetic, analysis, of, austroasiatic, languages, using, a, 200, word, list, many, of, the, tentative, groupings, are, likely, linkages, pakanic, and, shompen, were, not, included, bahnaric, vietic, katuic, khmeric, pearic, mang, khmuic, khasian, palaungic, monic, nicobarese, aslian, munda, roger, blench, 2009, also, proposes, that, there, might, have, been, other, primary, branches, of, austroasiatic, that, are, now, extinct, based, on, substrate, evidence, in, modern, day, languages, other, languages, with, proposed, austroasiatic, substrata, are, john, peterson, 2017, suggests, that, pre, munda, proto, in, regular, terminology, languages, may, have, once, dominated, the, eastern, indo, gangetic, plain, and, were, then, absorbed, by, indo, aryan, languages, at, an, early, date, as, indo, aryan, spread, east, peterson, notes, that, eastern, indo, aryan, languages, display, many, morphosyntactic, features, similar, to, those, of, munda, languages, while, western, indo, aryan, languages, do, not, other, than, latin, based, alphabets, many, austroasiatic, languages, are, written, with, the, khmer, thai, lao, and, burmese, alphabets, vietnamese, divergently, had, an, indigenous, script, based, on, chinese, logographic, writing, this, has, since, been, supplanted, by, the, latin, alphabet, in, the, 20th, century, the, following, are, examples, of, past, used, alphabets, or, current, alphabets, of, austroasiatic, languages, austroasiatic, is, an, integral, part, of, the, controversial, austric, hypothesis, which, also, includes, the, austronesian, languages, and, in, some, proposals, also, the, kra, dai, languages, and, the, hmong, mien, languages, several, lexical, resemblances, are, found, between, the, hmong, mien, and, austroasiatic, language, families, ratliff, 2010, some, of, which, had, earlier, been, proposed, by, haudricourt, 1951, this, could, imply, a, relation, or, early, language, contact, along, the, yangtze, according, to, cai, et, al, 2011, hmong, mien, people, are, genetically, related, to, austroasiatic, speakers, and, their, languages, were, heavily, influenced, by, sino, tibetan, especially, tibeto, burman, languages, it, is, suggested, that, the, austroasiatic, languages, have, some, influence, on, indo, aryan, languages, including, sanskrit, and, middle, indo, aryan, languages, indian, linguist, suniti, kumar, chatterji, pointed, that, a, specific, number, of, substantives, in, languages, such, as, hindi, punjabi, and, bengali, were, borrowed, from, munda, languages, additionally, french, linguist, jean, przyluski, suggested, a, similarity, between, the, tales, from, the, austroasiatic, realm, and, the, indian, mythological, stories, of, matsyagandha, satyavati, from, mahabharata, and, the, n, gas, mitsuru, sakitani, suggests, that, haplogroup, o1b1, which, is, common, in, austroasiatic, people, and, some, other, ethnic, groups, in, southern, china, and, haplogroup, o1b2, which, is, common, in, today, s, japanese, and, koreans, are, the, carriers, of, early, rice, agriculture, from, southern, china, another, study, suggests, that, the, haplogroup, o1b1, is, the, major, austroasiatic, paternal, lineage, and, o1b2, the, para, austroasiatic, lineage, of, the, koreans, and, yayoi, people, a, full, genomic, study, by, lipson, et, al, 2018, identified, a, characteristic, lineage, that, can, be, associated, with, the, spread, of, austroasiatic, languages, in, southeast, asia, and, which, can, be, traced, back, to, remains, of, neolithic, farmers, from, m, n, b, c, c, 2000, bce, in, the, red, river, delta, in, northern, vietnam, and, to, closely, related, ban, chiang, and, vat, komnou, remains, in, thailand, and, cambodia, respectively, this, austroasiatic, lineage, can, be, modeled, as, a, sister, group, of, the, austronesian, peoples, with, significant, admixture, ca, 30, from, a, deeply, diverging, eastern, eurasian, source, modeled, by, the, authors, as, sharing, some, genetic, drift, with, the, onge, a, modern, andamanese, hunter, gatherer, group, and, which, is, ancestral, to, modern, austroasiatic, speaking, groups, of, southeast, asia, such, as, the, mlabri, and, the, nicobarese, and, partially, to, the, austroasiatic, munda, speaking, groups, of, south, asia, e, g, the, juang, significant, levels, of, austroasiatic, ancestry, were, also, found, in, austronesian, speaking, groups, of, sumatra, java, and, borneo, austroasiatic, speaking, groups, in, southern, china, such, as, the, wa, and, blang, in, yunnan, predominatly, carry, the, same, mainland, southeast, asian, neolithic, farmer, ancestry, but, with, additional, geneflow, from, northern, and, southern, east, asian, lineages, that, can, be, associated, with, the, spread, of, tibeto, burman, and, kra, dai, languages, respectively, according, to, chaubey, et, al, austro, asiatic, speakers, in, india, today, are, derived, from, dispersal, from, southeast, asia, followed, by, extensive, sex, specific, admixture, with, local, indian, populations, according, to, riccio, et, al, the, munda, peoples, are, likely, descended, from, austroasiatic, migrants, from, southeast, asia, according, to, zhang, et, al, austroasiatic, migrations, from, southeast, asia, into, india, took, place, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, circa, 10, 000, years, ago, arunkumar, et, al, suggest, austroasiatic, migrations, from, southeast, asia, occurred, into, northeast, india, 5, 2, 0, 6, kya, and, into, east, india, 4, 3, 0, 2, kya
