the, california, institute, of, technology, branded, as, caltech, is, a, private, research, university, in, pasadena, california, the, university, is, responsible, for, many, modern, scientific, advances, and, is, among, a, small, group, of, institutes, of, technology, in, the, united, states, that, are, devoted, to, the, instruction, of, pure, and, applied, sciences, the, institution, was, founded, as, a, preparatory, and, vocational, school, by, amos, g, throop, in, 1891, and, began, attracting, influential, scientists, such, as, george, ellery, hale, arthur, amos, noyes, and, robert, andrews, millikan, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, vocational, and, preparatory, schools, were, disbanded, and, spun, off, in, 1910, and, the, college, assumed, its, present, name, in, 1920, in, 1934, caltech, was, elected, to, the, association, of, american, universities, and, the, antecedents, of, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, which, caltech, continues, to, manage, and, operate, were, established, between, 1936, and, 1943, under, theodore, von, k, rm, n, caltech, has, six, academic, divisions, with, strong, emphasis, on, science, and, engineering, managing, 423, million, in, sponsored, research, in, 2022, its, 124, acre, 50, ha, primary, campus, is, located, approximately, 11, mi, 18, km, northeast, of, downtown, los, angeles, in, pasadena, first, year, students, are, required, to, live, on, campus, and, 95, of, undergraduates, remain, in, the, on, campus, housing, system, at, caltech, students, agree, to, abide, by, an, honor, code, which, allows, faculty, to, assign, take, home, examinations, the, caltech, beavers, compete, in, 13, intercollegiate, sports, in, the, ncaa, division, iii, s, southern, california, intercollegiate, athletic, conference, sciac, scientists, and, engineers, at, or, from, the, university, have, played, an, essential, role, in, many, modern, scientific, breakthroughs, and, innovations, including, advances, in, space, research, sustainability, science, quantum, physics, earthquake, monitoring, protein, engineering, and, soft, robotics, as, of, october, 2022, there, are, 79, nobel, laureates, who, have, been, affiliated, with, caltech, making, it, the, institution, with, the, highest, number, of, nobelists, per, capita, in, america, this, includes, 46, alumni, and, faculty, members, 47, prizes, with, chemist, linus, pauling, being, the, only, individual, in, history, to, win, two, unshared, prizes, in, addition, four, fields, medalists, and, six, turing, award, winners, have, been, affiliated, with, caltech, caltech, started, as, a, vocational, school, founded, in, present, day, old, pasadena, on, fair, oaks, avenue, and, chestnut, street, on, september, 23, 1891, by, local, businessman, and, politician, amos, g, throop, the, school, was, known, successively, as, throop, university, throop, polytechnic, institute, and, manual, training, school, and, throop, college, of, technology, before, acquiring, its, current, name, in, 1920, the, vocational, school, was, disbanded, and, the, preparatory, program, was, split, off, to, form, the, independent, polytechnic, school, in, 1907, at, a, time, when, scientific, research, in, the, united, states, was, still, in, its, infancy, george, ellery, hale, a, solar, astronomer, from, the, university, of, chicago, founded, the, mount, wilson, observatory, in, 1904, he, joined, throop, s, board, of, trustees, in, 1907, and, soon, began, developing, the, university, and, the, whole, of, pasadena, into, a, major, scientific, and, cultural, destination, he, engineered, the, appointment, of, james, a, b, scherer, a, literary, scholar, untutored, in, science, but, very, capable, in, administration, and, fund, raising, to, throop, s, presidency, in, 1908, scherer, persuaded, retired, businessman, and, trustee, charles, w, gates, to, donate, 25, 000, in, seed, money, equivalent, to, 800, 000, in, 2023, to, build, gates, laboratory, the, first, science, building, on, campus, in, 1910, throop, moved, to, its, current, site, arthur, fleming, donated, the, land, for, the, permanent, campus, site, theodore, roosevelt, delivered, an, address, at, throop, institute, on, march, 21, 1911, and, he, declared, i, want, to, see, institutions, like, throop, turn, out, perhaps, ninety, nine, of, every, hundred, students, as, men, who, are, to, do, given, pieces, of, industrial, work, better, than, any, one, else, can, do, them, i, want, to, see, those, men, do, the, kind, of, work, that, is, now, being, done, on, the, panama, canal, and, on, the, great, irrigation, projects, in, the, interior, of, this, country, and, the, one, hundredth, man, i, want, to, see, with, the, kind, of, cultural, scientific, training, that, will, make, him, and, his, fellows, the, matrix, out, of, which, you, can, occasionally, develop, a, man, like, your, great, astronomer, george, ellery, hale, also, in, 1911, a, bill, was, introduced, in, the, california, legislature, calling, for, the, establishment, of, a, publicly, funded, california, institute, of, technology, with, an, initial, budget, of, a, million, dollars, ten, times, the, budget, of, throop, at, the, time, the, board, of, trustees, offered, to, turn, throop, over, to, the, state, but, the, presidents, of, stanford, university, and, the, university, of, california, berkeley, successfully, lobbied, to, defeat, the, bill, which, allowed, throop, to, develop, as, the, only, scientific, research, oriented, educational, institute, in, southern, california, public, or, private, until, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, necessitated, the, broader, development, of, research, based, science, education, the, promise, of, throop, attracted, physical, chemist, arthur, amos, noyes, from, mit, to, develop, the, institution, and, assist, in, establishing, it, as, a, center, for, science, and, technology, with, the, onset, of, world, war, i, hale, organized, the, national, research, council, to, coordinate, and, support, scientific, work, on, military, problems, while, he, supported, the, idea, of, federal, appropriations, for, science, he, took, exception, to, a, federal, bill, that, would, have, funded, engineering, research, at, land, grant, colleges, and, instead, sought, to, raise, a, 1, million, national, research, fund, entirely, from, private, sources, to, that, end, as, hale, wrote, in, the, new, york, times, throop, college, of, technology, in, pasadena, california, has, recently, afforded, a, striking, illustration, of, one, way, in, which, the, research, council, can, secure, co, operation, and, advance, scientific, investigation, this, institution, with, its, able, investigators, and, excellent, research, laboratories, could, be, of, great, service, in, any, broad, scheme, of, cooperation, president, scherer, hearing, of, the, formation, of, the, council, immediately, offered, to, take, part, in, its, work, and, with, this, object, he, secured, within, three, days, an, additional, research, endowment, of, one, hundred, thousand, dollars, through, the, national, research, council, hale, simultaneously, lobbied, for, science, to, play, a, larger, role, in, national, affairs, and, for, throop, to, play, a, national, role, in, science, the, new, funds, were, designated, for, physics, research, and, ultimately, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, norman, bridge, laboratory, which, attracted, experimental, physicist, robert, andrews, millikan, from, the, university, of, chicago, in, 1917, during, the, course, of, the, war, hale, noyes, and, millikan, worked, together, in, washington, on, the, nrc, subsequently, they, continued, their, partnership, in, developing, caltech, under, the, leadership, of, hale, noyes, and, millikan, aided, by, the, booming, economy, of, southern, california, caltech, grew, to, national, prominence, in, the, 1920s, and, concentrated, on, the, development, of, roosevelt, s, hundredth, man, on, november, 29, 1921, the, trustees, declared, it, to, be, the, express, policy, of, the, institute, to, pursue, scientific, research, of, the, greatest, importance, and, at, the, same, time, to, continue, to, conduct, thorough, courses, in, engineering, and, pure, science, basing, the, work, of, these, courses, on, exceptionally, strong, instruction, in, the, fundamental, sciences, of, mathematics, physics, and, chemistry, broadening, and, enriching, the, curriculum, by, a, liberal, amount, of, instruction, in, such, subjects, as, english, history, and, economics, and, vitalizing, all, the, work, of, the, institute, by, the, infusion, in, generous, measure, of, the, spirit, of, research, in, 1923, millikan, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1925, the, school, established, a, department, of, geology, and, hired, william, bennett, munro, then, chairman, of, the, division, of, history, government, and, economics, at, harvard, university, to, create, a, division, of, humanities, and, social, sciences, at, caltech, in, 1928, a, division, of, biology, was, established, under, the, leadership, of, thomas, hunt, morgan, the, most, distinguished, biologist, in, the, united, states, at, the, time, and, discoverer, of, the, role, of, genes, and, the, chromosome, in, heredity, in, 1930, kerckhoff, marine, laboratory, was, established, in, corona, del, mar, under, the, care, of, professor, george, macginitie, in, 1926, a, graduate, school, of, aeronautics, was, created, which, eventually, attracted, theodore, von, k, rm, n, k, rm, n, later, helped, create, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, and, played, an, integral, part, in, establishing, caltech, as, one, of, the, world, s, centers, for, rocket, science, in, 1928, construction, of, the, palomar, observatory, began, millikan, served, as, chairman, of, the, executive, council, effectively, caltech, s, president, from, 1921, to, 1945, and, his, influence, was, such, that, the, institute, was, occasionally, referred, to, as, millikan, s, school, millikan, initiated, a, visiting, scholars, program, soon, after, joining, caltech, notable, scientists, who, accepted, his, invitation, include, paul, dirac, erwin, schr, dinger, werner, heisenberg, hendrik, lorentz, and, niels, bohr, albert, einstein, arrived, on, the, caltech, campus, for, the, first, time, in, 1931, to, polish, up, his, theory, of, general, relativity, and, he, returned, to, caltech, subsequently, as, a, visiting, professor, in, 1932, and, 1933, during, world, war, ii, caltech, was, one, of, 131, colleges, and, universities, nationally, that, took, part, in, the, v, 12, navy, college, training, program, which, offered, students, a, path, to, a, navy, commission, the, united, states, navy, also, maintained, a, naval, training, school, for, aeronautical, engineering, resident, inspectors, of, ordinance, and, naval, material, and, a, liaison, officer, to, the, national, defense, research, committee, on, campus, during, the, war, some, scientists, from, caltech, including, j, robert, oppenheimer, richard, tolman, and, robert, bacher, were, instrumental, in, the, manhattan, project, and, contributed, to, critical, aspects, of, the, atomic, bomb, s, development, caltech, was, also, directly, involved, in, other, bomb, related, research, with, a, group, led, by, charles, lauritsen, which, assisted, in, the, development, of, the, high, explosive, lenses, used, in, the, fat, man, implosion, bomb, crucial, to, the, trinity, test, and, the, subsequent, bombing, of, nagasaki, lauritsen, s, team, at, caltech, developed, detonators, that, would, later, be, used, in, atomic, bombs, in, november, 1943, caltech, and, the, u, s, navy, established, the, naval, ordnance, test, station, nots, in, inyokern, california, near, the, mojave, desert, to, work, on, aircraft, ordnance, and, rocket, development, one, of, the, most, successful, innovations, was, the, development, of, the, 5, inch, high, velocity, aircraft, rocket, commonly, known, as, the, holy, moses, which, was, used, in, combat, against, enemy, fortifications, and, ships, the, partnership, between, the, navy, and, caltech, continued, to, deepen, throughout, the, war, leading, to, the, creation, of, several, military, technologies, and, by, 1945, the, focus, of, caltech, s, war, contributions, expanded, further, with, project, camel, a, collaboration, between, the, naval, ordnance, test, station, and, the, manhattan, project, caltech, scientists, worked, on, a, variety, of, assignments, including, b, 29, airdrop, tests, of, model, atomic, bombs, and, the, manufacturing, of, explosives, for, use, in, the, atomic, bomb, s, implosion, mechanism, additionally, the, salt, wells, pilot, plant, at, inyokern, was, developed, with, caltech, scientists, in, response, to, concerns, about, the, safety, of, explosive, production, at, los, alamos, and, began, producing, high, explosives, just, days, before, the, trinity, test, in, july, 1945, early, in, the, war, caltech, scientists, including, lauritsen, s, son, thomas, lauritsen, worked, on, various, rocket, designs, at, the, kellogg, radiation, laboratory, these, rockets, including, the, tiny, tim, and, the, mighty, mouse, were, used, in, critical, military, operations, from, naval, engagements, to, land, assaults, by, the, end, of, the, war, caltech, had, essentially, become, an, extension, of, the, u, s, navy, s, bureau, of, ordnance, with, its, rocket, research, providing, important, technology, to, u, s, combat, capabilities, from, april, to, december, 1951, caltech, was, the, host, of, a, federal, classified, study, project, vista, the, selection, of, caltech, as, host, for, the, project, was, based, on, the, university, s, expertise, in, rocketry, and, nuclear, physics, in, response, to, the, war, in, korea, and, the, pressure, from, the, soviet, union, the, project, was, caltech, s, way, of, assisting, the, federal, government, in, its, effort, to, increase, national, security, the, project, was, created, to, study, new, ways, of, improving, the, relationship, between, tactical, air, support, and, ground, troops, the, army, air, force, and, navy, sponsored, the, project, however, it, was, under, contract, with, the, army, the, study, was, named, after, the, hotel, vista, del, arroyo, hotel, which, housed, the, study, the, study, operated, under, a, committee, with, the, supervision, of, president, lee, a, dubridge, william, a, fowler, a, professor, at, caltech, was, selected, as, research, director, more, than, a, fourth, of, caltech, s, faculty, and, a, group, of, outside, scientists, staffed, the, project, moreover, the, number, increases, if, one, takes, into, account, visiting, scientists, military, liaisons, secretarial, and, security, staff, in, compensation, for, its, participation, the, university, received, about, 750, 000, from, the, 1950s, to, 1980s, caltech, was, the, home, of, murray, gell, mann, and, richard, feynman, whose, work, was, central, to, the, establishment, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, feynman, was, also, widely, known, outside, the, physics, community, as, an, exceptional, teacher, and, a, colorful, unconventional, character, during, lee, a, dubridge, s, tenure, as, caltech, s, president, 1946, 1969, caltech, s, faculty, doubled, and, the, campus, tripled, in, size, dubridge, unlike, his, predecessors, welcomed, federal, funding, of, science, new, research, fields, flourished, including, chemical, biology, planetary, science, nuclear, astrophysics, and, geochemistry, a, 200, inch, telescope, was, dedicated, on, nearby, palomar, mountain, in, 1948, and, remained, the, world, s, most, powerful, optical, telescope, for, over, forty, years, caltech, opened, its, doors, to, female, undergraduates, during, the, presidency, of, harold, brown, in, 1970, and, they, made, up, 14, of, the, entering, class, the, portion, of, female, undergraduates, has, been, increasing, since, then, protests, by, caltech, students, are, rare, the, earliest, was, a, 1968, protest, outside, the, nbc, burbank, studios, in, response, to, rumors, that, nbc, was, to, cancel, star, trek, in, 1973, the, students, from, dabney, house, protested, a, presidential, visit, with, a, sign, on, the, library, bearing, the, simple, phrase, impeach, nixon, the, following, week, ross, mccollum, president, of, the, national, oil, company, wrote, an, open, letter, to, dabney, house, stating, that, in, light, of, their, actions, he, had, decided, not, to, donate, one, million, dollars, to, caltech, the, dabney, family, being, republicans, disowned, dabney, house, after, hearing, of, the, protest, since, 2000, the, einstein, papers, project, has, been, located, at, caltech, the, project, was, established, in, 1986, to, assemble, preserve, translate, and, publish, papers, selected, from, the, literary, estate, of, albert, einstein, and, from, other, collections, in, fall, 2008, the, freshman, class, was, 42, female, a, record, for, caltech, s, undergraduate, enrollment, in, the, same, year, the, institute, concluded, a, six, year, long, fund, raising, campaign, the, campaign, raised, more, than, 1, 4, billion, from, about, 16, 000, donors, nearly, half, of, the, funds, went, into, the, support, of, caltech, programs, and, projects, in, 2010, caltech, in, partnership, with, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, and, headed, by, professor, nathan, lewis, established, a, doe, energy, innovation, hub, aimed, at, developing, revolutionary, methods, to, generate, fuels, directly, from, sunlight, this, hub, the, joint, center, for, artificial, photosynthesis, will, receive, up, to, 122, million, in, federal, funding, over, five, years, since, 2012, caltech, began, to, offer, classes, through, massive, open, online, courses, moocs, under, coursera, from, 2013, edx, and, bootcamps, jean, lou, chameau, the, eighth, president, announced, on, february, 19, 2013, that, he, would, be, stepping, down, to, accept, the, presidency, at, king, abdullah, university, of, science, and, technology, thomas, f, rosenbaum, was, announced, to, be, the, ninth, president, of, caltech, on, october, 24, 2013, and, his, term, began, on, july, 1, 2014, in, 2019, caltech, received, a, gift, of, 750, million, for, sustainability, research, from, the, resnick, family, of, the, wonderful, company, the, gift, is, the, largest, ever, for, environmental, sustainability, research, and, the, second, largest, private, donation, to, a, us, academic, institution, after, bloomberg, s, gift, of, 1, 8, billion, to, johns, hopkins, university, in, 2018, on, account, of, president, robert, a, millikan, s, affiliation, with, the, human, betterment, foundation, in, january, 2021, the, caltech, board, of, trustees, authorized, the, removal, of, millikan, s, name, and, the, names, of, five, other, historical, figures, affiliated, with, the, foundation, from, campus, buildings, caltech, s, 124, acre, 50, ha, primary, campus, is, located, in, pasadena, california, approximately, 11, miles, 18, km, northeast, of, downtown, los, angeles, it, is, within, walking, distance, of, old, town, pasadena, and, the, pasadena, playhouse, district, and, therefore, the, two, locations, are, frequent, getaways, for, caltech, students, in, 1917, hale, hired, architect, bertram, goodhue, to, produce, a, master, plan, for, the, 22, acres, 8, 9, ha, campus, goodhue, conceived, the, overall, layout, of, the, campus, and, designed, the, physics, building, dabney, hall, and, several, other, structures, in, which, he, sought, to, be, consistent, with, the, local, climate, the, character, of, the, school, and, hale, s, educational, philosophy, goodhue, s, designs, for, caltech, were, also, influenced, by, the, traditional, spanish, mission, architecture, of, southern, california, during, the, 1960s, caltech, underwent, considerable, expansion, in, part, due, to, the, philanthropy, of, alumnus, arnold, o, beckman, in, 1953, beckman, was, asked, to, join, the, caltech, board, of, trustees, 282, in, 1964, he, became, its, chairman, 275, over, the, next, few, years, as, caltech, s, president, emeritus, david, baltimore, describes, it, arnold, beckman, and, his, wife, mabel, shaped, the, destiny, of, caltech, 288, in, 1971, a, magnitude, 6, 6, earthquake, in, san, fernando, caused, some, damage, to, the, caltech, campus, engineers, who, evaluated, the, damage, found, that, two, historic, buildings, dating, from, the, early, days, of, the, institute, throop, hall, and, the, goodhue, designed, culbertson, auditorium, had, cracked, new, additions, to, the, campus, include, the, cahill, center, for, astronomy, and, astrophysics, and, the, walter, and, leonore, annenberg, center, for, information, science, and, technology, which, opened, in, 2009, and, the, warren, and,

caltech, community, shall, take, unfair, advantage, of, any, other, member, of, the, caltech, community, this, is, enforced, by, a, board, of, control, which, consists, of, undergraduate, students, and, by, a, similar, body, at, the, graduate, level, called, the, graduate, honor, council, the, honor, code, aims, at, promoting, an, atmosphere, of, respect, and, trust, that, allows, caltech, students, to, enjoy, privileges, that, make, for, a, more, relaxed, atmosphere, for, example, the, honor, code, allows, professors, to, make, the, majority, of, exams, as, take, home, allowing, students, to, take, them, on, their, own, schedule, and, in, their, preferred, environment, through, the, late, 1990s, the, only, exception, to, the, honor, code, implemented, earlier, in, the, decade, in, response, to, changes, in, federal, regulations, concerned, the, sexual, harassment, policy, today, there, are, myriad, exceptions, to, the, honor, code, in, the, form, of, new, institute, policies, such, as, the, fire, policy, and, alcohol, policy, although, both, policies, are, presented, in, the, honor, system, handbook, given, to, new, members, of, the, caltech, community, some,

office, has, also, taken, up, pursuing, investigations, independently, of, the, board, of, control, and, conduct, review, committee, an, implicit, violation, of, both, the, honor, code, and, written, disciplinary, policy, that, has, contributed, to, further, erosion, of, trust, between, some, parts, of, the, undergraduate, community, and, the, administration, as, of, october, 2022, caltech, has,
