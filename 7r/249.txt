the, ojibwe, trading, with, the, hereditary, enemies, of, the, sioux, the, cree, and, assiniboine, tensions, rose, in, the, 1720s, into, a, prolonged, war, in, 1736, the, dakota, lost, their, traditional, lands, around, leech, lake, and, mille, lacs, as, they, were, forced, south, along, the, mississippi, river, and, st, croix, river, valley, as, a, result, of, the, battles, these,

group, of, sioux, killed, jean, baptiste, de, la, v, rendrye, and, twenty, other, men, on, an, island, in, lake, of, the, woods, for, such, reasons, however, trade, with, the, french, continued, until, the, french, gave, up, north, america, in, 1763, europeans, repeatedly, tried, to, make, truce, between, the, warring, tribes, in, order, to, protect, their, interests, one, of, the, larger,

back, as, they, would, quickly, destroy, their, enemies, when, the, dakota, joined, the, battle, they, had, the, upper, hand, until, sandy, lake, ojibwe, reinforcements, arrived, the, dakota, were, driven, back, and, warren, states, many, were, driven, over, the, rocks, into, the, boiling, floods, below, there, to, find, a, watery, grave, others, in, attempting, to, jump, into, their, narrow, wooden, canoes, were, capsized, into, the, rapids, while, dakota, and, ojibwe, suffered, heavy, losses, the, meskwaki, were, left, with, the, most, dead, and, forced, to, join, their, relatives, the,

sisseton, and, wahpeton, bands, of, the, dakota, ceded, 21, million, acres, for, 1, 665, 000, or, about, 7, 5, cents, an, acre, however, the, american, government, kept, more, than, 80, of, the, funds, with, only, the, interest, 5, for, 50, years, being, paid, to, the, dakota, the, u, s, set, aside, two, reservations, for, the, sioux, along, the, minnesota, river, each, about, 20, miles, 30, km, wide, and, 70, miles, 110, km, long, later, the, government, declared, these, were, intended, to, be, temporary, in, an, effort, to, force, the, sioux, out, of, minnesota, the, upper, sioux, agency, for, the, sisseton, and, wahpeton, bands, was, established, near, granite, falls, minnesota, while, the, lower, sioux, agency, for, the, mdewakanton, and, wahpekute, bands, was, established, about, thirty, miles, downstream, near, what, developed, as, redwood, falls, minnesota, the, upper, sioux, were, not, satisfied, with, their, reservation, because, of, low, food, supplies, but, as, it, included, several, of, their, old, villages, they, agreed, to, stay, the, lower, sioux, were, displaced, from, their, traditional, woodlands, and, were, dissatisfied, with, their, new, territory, of, mostly, prairie, the, u, s, intended, the, treaties, to, encourage, the, sioux, to, convert, from, their, nomadic, hunting, lifestyle, into, more, european, american, settled, farming, offering, them, compensation, in, the, transition, by, 1858, the, dakota, only, had, a, small, strip, of, land, along, the, minnesota, river, with, no, access, to, their, traditional, hunting, grounds, they, had, to, rely, on, treaty, payments, for, their, survival, which, were, often, late, the, forced, change, in, lifestyle, and, the, much, lower, than, expected, payments, from, the, federal, government, caused, economic, suffering, and, increased, social, tensions, within, the, tribes, by, 1862, many, dakota, were, starving, and, tensions, erupted, in, the, dakota, war, of, 1862, by, 1862, shortly, after, a, failed, crop, the, year, before, and, a, winter, starvation, the, federal, payment, was, late, the, local, traders, refused, to, issue, any, credit, to, the, dakota, one, trader, andrew, myrick, went, so, far, as, to, say, if, they, re, hungry, let, them, eat, grass, on, august, 16, 1862, the, treaty, payments, to, the, eastern, dakota, arrived, in, st, paul, minnesota, and, were, brought, to, fort, ridgely, the, next, day, however, they, arrived, too, late, to, prevent, the, war, on, august, 17, 1862, the, dakota, war, began, when, a, few, santee, men, murdered, a, white, farmer, and, most, of, his, family, they, inspired, further, attacks, on, white, settlements, along, the, minnesota, river, on, august, 18, 1862, little, crow, of, the, mdewakanton, band, led, a, group, that, attacked, the, lower, sioux, agency, or, redwood, agency, and, trading, post, located, there, later, settlers, found, myrick, among, the, dead, with, his, mouth, stuffed, full, of, grass, many, of, the, upper, dakota, sisseton, and, wahpeton, wanted, no, part, in, the, attacks, with, the, majority, of, the, 4, 000, members, of, the, sisseton, and, wahpeton, opposed, to, the, war, thus, their, bands, did, not, participate, in, the, early, killings, historian, mary, wingerd, has, stated, that, it, is, a, complete, myth, that, all, the, dakota, people, went, to, war, against, the, united, states, and, that, it, was, rather, a, faction, that, went, on, the, offensive, most, of, little, crow, s, men, surrendered, shortly, after, the, battle, of, wood, lake, at, camp, release, on, september, 26, 1862, little, crow, was, forced, to, retreat, sometime, in, september, 1862, he, stayed, briefly, in, canada, but, soon, returned, to, the, western, minnesota, he, was, killed, on, july, 3, 1863, near, hutchinson, minnesota, while, gathering, raspberries, with, his, teenage, son, the, pair, had, wandered, onto, the, land, of, a, settler, nathan, lamson, who, shot, at, them, to, collect, bounties, once, it, was, discovered, that, the, body, was, of, little, crow, his, skull, and, scalp, were, put, on, display, by, the, minnesota, historical, society, in, st, paul, minnesota, the, state, held, the, trophies, until, 1971, when, it, returned, the, remains, to, little, crow, s, grandson, for, killing, little, crow, the, state, increased, the, bounty, to, 500, when, it, paid, lamson, on, november, 5, 1862, a, military, tribunal, found, 303, mostly, mdewakanton, tribesmen, guilty, of, rape, murder, and, atrocities, of, hundreds, of, minnesota, settlers, they, were, sentenced, to, be, hanged, the, men, had, no, attorneys, or, defense, witnesses, and, many, were, convicted, in, less, than, five, minutes, president, abraham, lincoln, commuted, the, death, sentences, of, 284, of, the, warriors, while, signing, off, on, the, hanging, of, 38, santee, men, on, december, 26, 1862, in, mankato, minnesota, it, was, the, largest, mass, execution, in, u, s, history, on, u, s, soil, the, men, remanded, by, order, of, president, lincoln, were, sent, to, a, prison, in, iowa, where, more, than, half, died, afterwards, the, u, s, congress, annulled, all, treaty, agreements, with, the, eastern, dakota, and, expelled, the, eastern, dakota, with, the, forfeiture, act, of, february, 16, 1863, meaning, all, lands, held, by, the, eastern, dakota, and, all, annuities, due, to, them, were, forfeited, to, the, u, s, government, during, and, after, the, hostilities, the, majority, of, eastern, dakota, fled, minnesota, for, the, dakota, territory, or, canada, some, settled, in, the, james, river, valley, in, a, short, lived, reservation, before, being, forced, to, move, to, crow, creek, reservation, on, the, east, bank, of, the, missouri, river, there, were, as, few, as, 50, eastern, dakota, left, in, minnesota, by, 1867, many, had, fled, to, the, santee, sioux, reservation, in, nebraska, created, 1863, the, flandreau, reservation, created, 1869, from, members, who, left, the, santee, reservation, the, lake, traverse, and, spirit, lake, reservations, both, created, 1867, those, who, fled, to, canada, throughout, the, 1870s, now, have, descendants, residing, on, nine, small, dakota, reserves, five, of, which, are, located, in, manitoba, sioux, valley, dakota, plain, dakota, tipi, birdtail, creek, and, canupawakpa, dakota, and, the, remaining, four, standing, buffalo, white, cap, round, plain, and, wood, mountain, in, saskatchewan, a, few, dakota, joined, the, yanktonai, and, moved, further, west, to, join, with, the, lakota, bands, to, continue, their, struggle, against, the, united, states, military, later, settling, on, the, fort, peck, reservation, in, montana, prior, to, the, 1650s, the, th, t, u, wa, division, of, the, o, h, thi, ak, wi, known, as, the, lakota, was, noted, as, being, located, east, of, the, red, river, and, living, on, the, fringes, of, the, prairies, and, woods, of, the, prairies, of, southern, minnesota, and, the, eastern, dakotas, by, at, least, 1680, according, to, baptiste, good, s, winter, count, the, lakota, had, horses, by, 1700, while, the, dakota, continued, a, subsistence, cycle, of, corn, wild, rice, and, hunting, woodland, animals, the, lakota, increasing, became, reliant, on, bison, for, meat, and, its, by, products, housing, clothing, tools, as, they, expanded, their, territory, westward, with, the, arrival, of, the, horse, after, their, adoption, of, horse, culture, lakota, society, centered, on, the, buffalo, hunt, on, horseback, by, the, 19th, century, the, typical, year, of, the, lakota, was, a, communal, buffalo, hunt, as, early, in, spring, as, their, horses, had, recovered, from, the, rigors, of, the, winter, in, june, and, july, the, scattered, bands, of, the, tribes, gathered, together, into, large, encampments, which, included, ceremonies, such, as, the, sun, dance, these, gatherings, afforded, leaders, to, meet, to, make, political, decisions, plan, movements, arbitrate, disputes, and, organize, and, launch, raiding, expeditions, or, war, parties, in, the, fall, people, split, into, smaller, bands, to, facilitate, hunting, to, procure, meat, for, the, long, winter, between, the, fall, hunt, and, the, onset, of, winter, was, a, time, when, lakota, warriors, could, undertake, raiding, and, warfare, with, the, coming, of, winter, snows, the, lakota, settled, into, winter, camps, where, activities, of, the, season, ceremonies, and, dances, as, well, as, trying, to, ensure, adequate, winter, feed, for, their, horses, they, began, to, dominate, the, prairies, east, of, the, missouri, river, by, the, 1720s, at, the, same, time, the, lakota, branch, split, into, two, major, sects, the, sa, ne, who, moved, to, the, lake, traverse, area, on, the, south, dakota, north, dakota, minnesota, border, and, the, ogl, la, si, h, u, who, occupied, the, james, river, valley, however, by, about, 1750, the, sa, ne, had, moved, to, the, east, bank, of, the, missouri, river, followed, 10, years, later, by, the, ogl, la, and, brul, si, h, u, by, 1750, they, had, crossed, the, missouri, river, and, encountered, lewis, and, clark, in, 1804, initial, united, states, contact, with, the, lakota, during, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, of, 1804, 1806, was, marked, by, a, standoff, lakota, bands, refused, to, allow, the, explorers, to, continue, upstream, and, the, expedition, prepared, for, battle, which, never, came, in, 1776, the, lakota, defeated, the, cheyenne, for, the, black, hills, who, had, earlier, taken, the, region, from, the, kiowa, the, cheyenne, then, moved, west, to, the, powder, river, country, and, the, lakota, made, the, black, hills, their, home, as, their, territory, expanded, so, did, the, number, of, rival, groups, they, encountered, they, secured, an, alliance, with, the, northern, cheyenne, and, northern, arapaho, by, the, 1820s, as, intertribal, warfare, on, the, plains, increased, amongst, the, tribes, for, access, to, the, dwindling, population, of, buffalo, the, alliance, fought, the, mandan, hidatsa, and, arikara, for, control, of, the, missouri, river, in, north, dakota, by, the, 1840s, their, territory, expanded, to, the, powder, river, country, in, montana, in, which, they, fought, with, the, crow, their, victories, over, these, tribes, during, this, time, period, were, aided, by, the, fact, those, tribes, were, decimated, by, european, diseases, most, of, the, mandan, hidatsa, and, arikara, were, killed, by, smallpox, and, almost, half, the, population, of, the, crow, were, killed, due, to, smallpox, cholera, and, other, diseases, in, 1843, the, southern, lakotas, attacked, pawnee, chief, blue, coat, s, village, near, the, loup, in, nebraska, killing, many, and, burning, half, of, the, earth, lodges, and, 30, years, later, the, lakota, again, inflicted, a, blow, so, severe, on, the, pawnee, during, the, massacre, canyon, battle, near, republican, river, by, the, 1850s, the, lakota, were, known, as, the, most, powerful, tribe, on, the, plains, the, fort, laramie, treaty, of, 1851, was, signed, on, september, 17, 1851, between, u, s, treaty, commissioners, and, representatives, of, the, cheyenne, sioux, arapaho, crow, assiniboine, mandan, hidatsa, and, arikara, nations, the, treaty, was, an, agreement, between, nine, more, or, less, independent, parties, the, treaty, set, forth, traditional, territorial, claims, of, the, tribes, as, among, themselves, the, united, states, acknowledged, that, all, the, land, covered, by, the, treaty, was, indian, territory, and, did, not, claim, any, part, of, it, the, boundaries, agreed, to, in, the, fort, laramie, treaty, of, 1851, were, used, to, settle, a, number, of, claims, cases, in, the, 20th, century, the, tribes, guaranteed, safe, passage, for, settlers, on, the, oregon, trail, and, allowed, roads, and, forts, to, be, built, in, their, territories, in, return, for, promises, of, an, annuity, in, the, amount, of, fifty, thousand, dollars, for, fifty, years, the, treaty, should, also, make, an, effective, and, lasting, peace, among, the, eight, tribes, each, of, them, often, at, odds, with, a, number, of, the, others, the, treaty, was, broken, almost, immediately, after, its, inception, by, the, lakota, and, cheyenne, attacking, the, crow, over, the, next, two, years, in, 1858, the, failure, of, the, united, states, to, prevent, the, mass, immigration, of, miners, and, settlers, into, colorado, during, the, pike, s, peak, gold, rush, also, did, not, help, matters, they, took, over, indian, lands, in, order, to, mine, them, against, the, protests, of, the, indians, and, founded, towns, started, farms, and, improved, roads, such, immigrants, competed, with, the, tribes, for, game, and, water, straining, limited, resources, and, resulting, in, conflicts, with, the, emigrants, the, u, s, government, did, not, enforce, the, treaty, to, keep, out, the, immigrants, the, situation, escalated, with, the, grattan, affair, in, 1854, when, a, detachment, of, u, s, soldiers, illegally, entered, a, sioux, encampment, to, arrest, those, accused, of, stealing, a, cow, and, in, the, process, sparked, a, battle, in, which, chief, conquering, bear, was, killed, though, intertribal, fighting, had, existed, before, the, arrival, of, white, settlers, some, of, the, post, treaty, intertribal, fighting, can, be, attributed, to, mass, killings, of, bison, by, white, settlers, and, government, agents, the, u, s, army, did, not, enforce, treaty, regulations, and, allowed, hunters, onto, native, land, to, slaughter, buffalo, providing, protection, and, sometimes, ammunition, one, hundred, thousand, buffalo, were, killed, each, year, until, they, were, on, the, verge, of, extinction, which, threatened, the, tribes, subsistence, these, mass, killings, affected, all, tribes, thus, the, tribes, were, forced, onto, each, other, s, hunting, grounds, where, fighting, broke, out, on, july, 20, 1867, an, act, of, congress, created, the, indian, peace, commission, to, establish, peace, with, certain, hostile, indian, tribes, the, indian, peace, commission, was, generally, seen, as, a, failure, and, violence, had, reignited, even, before, it, was, disbanded, in, october, 1868, two, official, reports, were, submitted, to, the, federal, government, ultimately, recommending, that, the, u, s, cease, recognizing, tribes, as, sovereign, nations, refrain, from, making, treaties, with, them, employ, military, force, against, those, who, refused, to, relocate, to, reservations, and, move, the, bureau, of, indian, affairs, from, the, department, of, the, interior, to, the, department, of, war, the, system, of, treaties, eventually, deteriorated, to, the, point, of, collapse, and, a, decade, of, war, followed, the, commission, s, work, it, was, the, last, major, commission, of, its, kind, from, 1866, to, 1868, the, lakota, fought, the, united, states, army, in, the, wyoming, territory, and, the, montana, territory, in, what, is, known, as, red, cloud, s, war, also, referred, to, as, the, bozeman, war, the, war, is, named, after, red, cloud, a, prominent, lakota, chief, who, led, the, war, against, the, united, states, following, encroachment, into, the, area, by, the, u, s, military, the, sioux, victory, in, the, war, led, to, their, temporarily, preserving, their, control, of, the, powder, river, country, the, war, ended, with, the, treaty, of, fort, laramie, of, 1868, the, treaty, of, fort, laramie, also, the, sioux, treaty, of, 1868, was, an, agreement, between, the, u, s, and, the, oglala, miniconjou, and, brul, bands, of, lakota, people, yanktonai, dakota, and, arapaho, nation, following, the, failure, of, the, first, fort, laramie, treaty, signed, in, 1851, it, established, the, great, sioux, reservation, including, ownership, of, the, black, hills, and, set, aside, additional, lands, as, unceded, indian, territory, in, areas, of, south, dakota, wyoming, and, nebraska, and, possibly, montana, it, established, that, the, us, government, would, hold, the, authority, to, punish, not, only, white, settlers, who, committed, crimes, against, the, tribes, but, also, tribe, members, who, committed, crimes, and, who, were, to, be, delivered, to, the, government, rather, than, face, charges, in, tribal, courts, it, stipulated, that, the, government, would, abandon, forts, along, the, bozeman, trail, and, included, a, number, of, provisions, designed, to, encourage, a, transition, to, farming, and, move, the, tribes, closer, to, the, white, man, s, way, of, life, the, treaty, protected, specified, rights, of, third, parties, not, partaking, in, the, negotiations, and, effectively, ended, red, cloud, s, war, the, treaty, overall, and, in, comparison, with, the, 1851, agreement, represented, a, departure, from, earlier, considerations, of, tribal, customs, and, demonstrated, instead, the, government, s, more, heavy, handed, position, with, regard, to, tribal, nations, and, desire, to, assimilate, the, sioux, into, american, property, arrangements, and, social, customs, according, to, one, source, animosities, over, the, treaty, arose, almost, immediately, when, a, group, of, miniconjou, were, informed, they, were, no, longer, welcome, to, trade, at, fort, laramie, being, south, of, their, newly, established, territory, this, was, notwithstanding, that, the, treaty, did, not, make, any, stipulation, that, the, tribes, could, not, travel, outside, their, land, only, that, they, would, not, permanently, occupy, outside, land, the, only, travel, expressly, forbidden, by, the, treaty, was, that, of, white, settlers, onto, the, reservation, the, government, eventually, broke, the, terms, of, the, treaty, following, the, black, hills, gold, rush, and, an, expedition, into, the, area, by, george, armstrong, custer, in, 1874, and, failed, to, prevent, white, settlers, from, moving, onto, tribal, lands, rising, tensions, eventually, lead, again, to, open, conflict, in, the, great, sioux, war, of, 1876, 46, the, 1868, treaty, was, modified, three, times, by, the, us, congress, between, 1876, and, 1889, each, time, taking, more, land, originally, granted, including, unilaterally, seizing, the, black, hills, in, 1877, the, treaty, formed, the, basis, of, the, 1980, supreme, court, case, united, states, v, sioux, nation, of, indians, in, which, the, court, ruled, that, tribal, lands, covered, under, the, treaty, had, been, taken, illegally, by, the, us, government, and, the, tribe, was, owed, compensation, plus, interest, as, of, 2018, this, amounted, to, more, than, 1, billion, the, sioux, have, refused, the, payment, demanding, instead, the, return, of, their, land, the, ongoing, raids, and, battles, on, the, northern, plains, that, lasted, from, 1850, to, 1890, are, collectively, known, as, the, sioux, wars, included, are, the, dakota, war, of, 1862, 1862, 1864, red, cloud, s, war, 1866, 1868, and, the, black, hills, war, which, includes, the, battle, of, the,

decades, thousands, of, native, american, children, were, forcibly, removed, from, their, homes, and, sent, to, boarding, schools, with, a, primary, objective, of, assimilating, native, american, children, and, youth, into, euro, american, culture, while, at, the, same, time, providing, a, basic, education, in, euro, american, subject, matters, many, children, lost, knowledge, of, their, culture, and, languages, as, well, as, faced, physical, and, sexual, abuse, at, these, schools, in, 1978, the, government, tried, to, put, an, end, to, these, boarding, schools, and, placement, into, foster, families, with, the, indian, child, welfare, act, icwa, which, says, except, in, the, rarest, circumstances, native, american, children, must, be, placed, with, their, relatives, or, tribes, it, also, says, states, must, do, everything, it, can, to, keep, native, families, together, in, 2011, the, lakota, made, national, news, when, npr, s, investigative, series, called, lost, children, shattered, families, aired, it, exposed, what, many, critics, consider, to, be, the, kidnapping, of, lakota, children, from, their, homes, by, the, state, of, south, dakota, s, department, of, social, services, the, npr, investigation, found, south, dakota, has, the, most, cases, which, fail, to, abide, by, the, icwa, in, south, dakota, native, american, children, make, up, less, than, 15, percent, of, the, child, population, yet, they, make, up, more, than, half, of, the, children, in, foster, care, the, state, receives, thousands, of, dollars, from, the, federal, government, for, every, child, it, takes, from, a, family, and, in, some, cases, the, state, gets, even, more, money, if, the, child, is, native, american, lakota, activists, madonna, thunder, hawk, and, chase, iron, eyes, worked, with, the, lakota, people, s, law, project, as, they, sought, to, end, what, they, claimed, were, unlawful, seizures, of, native, american, lakota, children, in, south, dakota, and, to, stop, the, state, practice, of, placing, these, children, in, non, native, homes, they, are, currently, working, to, redirect, federal, funding, away, from, the, state, of, south, dakota, s, department, of, social, systems, to, a, new, tribal, foster, care, programs, in, 2015, in, response, to, the, investigative, reports, by, npr, the, lakota, people, s, law, project, as, well, as, the, coalition, of, all, nine, lakota, dakota, reservations, in, south, dakota, the, bureau, of, indian, affairs, updated, the, icwa, guidelines, to, give, more, strength, to, tribes, to, intervene, on, behalf, of, the, children, stating, the, updated, guidelines, establish, that, an, indian, child, parent, or, indian, custodian, or, tribe, may, petition, to, invalidate, an, action, if, the, act, or, guidelines, have, been, violated, regardless, of, which, party, s, rights, were, violated, this, approach, promotes, compliance, with, icwa, and, reflects, that, icwa, is, intended, to, protect, the, rights, of, each, of, these, parties, the, new, guidelines, also, not, only, prevent, courts, from, taking, children, away, based, on, socioeconomic, status, but, give, a, strict, definition, of, what, is, to, be, considered, harmful, living, conditions, previously, the, state, of, south, dakota, used, being, poor, as, harmful, in, the, summer, of, 2016, sioux, indians, and, the, standing, rock, sioux, tribe, began, a, protest, against, construction, of, the, dakota, access, oil, pipeline, also, known, as, the, bakken, pipeline, which, if, completed, is, designed, to, carry, hydrofracked, crude, oil, from, the, bakken, oil, fields, of, north, dakota, to, the, oil, storage, and, transfer, hub, of, patoka, illinois, the, pipeline, travels, only, half, a, mile, north, of, the, standing, rock, sioux, reservation, and, is, designed, to, pass, underneath, the, missouri, river, and, upstream, of, the, reservation, causing, many, concerns, over, the, tribe, s, drinking, water, safety, environmental, protection, and, harmful, impacts, on, culture, the, pipeline, company, claims, that, the, pipeline, will, provide, jobs, reduce, american, dependence, on, foreign, oil, and, reduce, the, price, of, gas, the, conflict, sparked, a, nationwide, debate, and, much, news, media, coverage, thousands, of, indigenous, and, non, indigenous, supporters, joined, the, protest, and, several, camp, sites, were, set, up, south, of, the, construction, zone, the, protest, was, peaceful, and, alcohol, drugs, and, firearms, were, not, allowed, at, the, campsite, or, the, protest, site, on, august, 23, standing, rock, sioux, tribe, released, a, list, of, 87, tribal, governments, who, wrote, resolutions, proclamations, and, letters, of, support, stating, their, solidarity, with, standing, rock, and, the, sioux, people, since, then, many, more, native, american, organizations, environmental, groups, and, civil, rights, groups, have, joined, the, effort, in, north, dakota, including, the, black, lives, matter, movement, vermont, senator, bernie, sanders, the, 2016, green, party, presidential, candidate, jill, stein, and, her, running, mate, ajamu, baraka, and, many, more, the, washington, post, called, it, a, national, movement, for, native, americans, in, november, 2022, 150, sacred, artifacts, are, repatriated, to, the, lakota, sioux, peoples, they, were, stored, for, more, than, a, century, at, the, founders, museum, in, barre, massachusetts, however, these, are, just, a, small, fraction, of, circa, 870, 000, native, american, artifacts, including, nearly, 110, 000, human, remains, that, are, still, at, prestigious, colleges, museums, and, the, federal, government, the, sioux, comprise, three, closely, related, language, groups, the, earlier, linguistic,

yanktonai, however, the, latest, studies, show, that, yankton, yanktonai, never, used, the, autonym, nakh, ta, but, pronounced, their, name, roughly, the, same, as, the, santee, i, e, dak, ta, these, later, studies, identify, assiniboine, and, stoney, as, two, separate, languages, with, sioux, being, the, third, language, sioux, has, three, similar, dialects, lakota, western, dakota, yankton, yanktonai, and, eastern, dakota, santee, sisseton, assiniboine, and, stoney, speakers, refer, to, themselves, as, nakh, ta, or, nakh, da, cf, nakota, the, term, dakota, has, also, been, applied, by, anthropologists, and, governmental, departments, to, refer, to, all, sioux, groups, resulting, in, names, such, as, teton, dakota, santee, dakota, etc, this, was, mainly, because, of, the, misrepresented, translation, of, the, ottawa, word, from, which, sioux, is, derived, the, sioux, are, divided, into, three, ethnic, groups, the, larger, of, which, are, divided, into, sub, groups, and, further, branched, into, bands, the, earliest, known, european, record, of, the, sioux, identified, them, in, minnesota, iowa, and, wisconsin, after, the, introduction, of, the, horse, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, sioux, dominated, larger, areas, of, land, from, present, day, central, canada, to, the, platte, river, from, minnesota, to, the, yellowstone, river, including, the, powder,

the, dakota, further, into, minnesota, and, west, and, southward, the, us, gave, the, name, dakota, territory, to, the, northern, expanse, west, of, the, mississippi, river, and, up, to, its, headwaters, today, the, santee, live, on, reservations, reserves, and, communities, in, minnesota, nebraska, south, dakota, north, dakota, and, canada, however, after, the, dakota, war, of, 1862, many, santee, were, sent, to, crow, creek, indian, reservation, and, in, 1864, some, from, the, crow, creek, reservation, were, sent, to, the, santee, sioux, reservation, the, ih, kthu, wa, ih, kthu,
