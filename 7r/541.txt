streets, in, the, late, 1500s, in, stockholm, patrol, duties, were, in, large, part, taken, over, by, a, special, corps, of, salaried, city, guards, the, city, guard, was, organized, uniformed, and, armed, like, a, military, unit, and, was, responsible, for, interventions, against, various, crimes, and, the, arrest, of, suspected, criminals, these, guards, were, assisted, by, the, military, fire, patrolmen, and, a, civilian, unit, that, did, not, wear, a, uniform, but, instead, wore, a, small, badge, around, the, neck, the, civilian, unit, monitored, compliance, with, city, ordinances, relating, to, e, g, sanitation, issues, traffic, and, taxes, in, rural, areas, the, king, s, bailiffs, were, responsible, for, law, and, order, until, the, establishment, of, counties, in, the, 1630s, up, to, the, early, 18th, century, the, level, of, state, involvement, in, law, enforcement, in, britain, was, low, although, some, law, enforcement, officials, existed, in, the, form, of, constables, and, watchmen, there, was, no, organized, police, force, a, professional, police, force, like, the, one, already, present, in, france, would, have, been, ill, suited, to, britain, which, saw, examples, such, as, the, french, one, as, a, threat, to, the, people, s, liberty, and, balanced, constitution, in, favor, of, an, arbitrary, and, tyrannical, government, law, enforcement, was, mostly, up, to, the, private, citizens, who, had, the, right, and, duty, to, prosecute, crimes, in, which, they, were, involved, or, in, which, they, were, not, at, the, cry, of, murder, or, stop, thief, everyone, was, entitled, and, obliged, to, join, the, pursuit, once, the, criminal, had, been, apprehended, the, parish, constables, and, night, watchmen, who, were, the, only, public, figures, provided, by, the, state, and, who, were, typically, part, time, and, local, would, make, the, arrest, as, a, result, the, state, set, a, reward, to, encourage, citizens, to, arrest, and, prosecute, offenders, the, first, of, such, rewards, was, established, in, 1692, of, the, amount, of, 40, for, the, conviction, of, a, highwayman, and, in, the, following, years, it, was, extended, to, burglars, coiners, and, other, forms, of, offense, the, reward, was, to, be, increased, in, 1720, when, after, the, end, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, and, the, consequent, rise, of, criminal, offenses, the, government, offered, 100, for, the, conviction, of, a, highwayman, although, the, offer, of, such, a, reward, was, conceived, as, an, incentive, for, the, victims, of, an, offense, to, proceed, to, the, prosecution, and, to, bring, criminals, to, justice, the, efforts, of, the, government, also, increased, the, number, of, private, thief, takers, thief, takers, became, infamously, known, not, so, much, for, what, they, were, supposed, to, do, catching, real, criminals, and, prosecuting, them, as, for, setting, themselves, up, as, intermediaries, between, victims, and, their, attackers, extracting, payments, for, the, return, of, stolen, goods, and, using, the, threat, of, prosecution, to, keep, offenders, in, thrall, some, of, them, such, as, jonathan, wild, became, infamous, at, the, time, for, staging, robberies, in, order, to, receive, the, reward, in, 1737, george, ii, began, paying, some, london, and, middlesex, watchmen, with, tax, monies, beginning, the, shift, to, government, control, in, 1749, judge, henry, fielding, began, organizing, a, force, of, quasi, professional, constables, known, as, the, bow, street, runners, the, bow, street, runners, are, considered, to, have, been, britain, s, first, dedicated, police, force, they, represented, a, formalization, and, regularization, of, existing, policing, methods, similar, to, the, unofficial, thief, takers, what, made, them, different, was, their, formal, attachment, to, the, bow, street, magistrates, office, and, payment, by, the, magistrate, with, funds, from, the, central, government, they, worked, out, of, fielding, s, office, and, court, at, no, 4, bow, street, and, did, not, patrol, but, served, writs, and, arrested, offenders, on, the, authority, of, the, magistrates, travelling, nationwide, to, apprehend, criminals, fielding, wanted, to, regulate, and, legalize, law, enforcement, activities, due, to, the, high, rate, of, corruption, and, mistaken, or, malicious, arrests, seen, with, the, system, that, depended, mainly, on, private, citizens, and, state, rewards, for, law, enforcement, henry, fielding, s, work, was, carried, on, by, his, brother, justice, john, fielding, who, succeeded, him, as, magistrate, in, the, bow, street, office, under, john, fielding, the, institution, of, the, bow, street, runners, gained, more, and, more, recognition, from, the, government, although, the, force, was, only, funded, intermittently, in, the, years, that, followed, in, 1763, the, bow, street, horse, patrol, was, established, to, combat, highway, robbery, funded, by, a, government, grant, the, bow, street, runners, served, as, the, guiding, principle, for, the, way, that, policing, developed, over, the, next, 80, years, bow, street, was, a, manifestation, of, the, move, towards, increasing, professionalisation, and, state, control, of, street, life, beginning, in, london, the, macdaniel, affair, a, 1754, british, political, scandal, in, which, a, group, of, thief, takers, was, found, to, be, falsely, prosecuting, innocent, men, in, order, to, collect, reward, money, from, bounties, added, further, impetus, for, a, publicly, salaried, police, force, that, did, not, depend, on, rewards, nonetheless, in, 1828, there, were, privately, financed, police, units, in, no, fewer, than, 45, parishes, within, a, 10, mile, radius, of, london, the, word, police, was, borrowed, from, french, into, the, english, language, in, the, 18th, century, but, for, a, long, time, it, applied, only, to, french, and, continental, european, police, forces, the, word, and, the, concept, of, police, itself, were, disliked, as, a, symbol, of, foreign, oppression, before, the, 19th, century, the, first, use, of, the, word, police, recorded, in, government, documents, in, the, united, kingdom, was, the, appointment, of, commissioners, of, police, for, scotland, in, 1714, and, the, creation, of, the, marine, police, in, 1798, following, early, police, forces, established, in, 1779, and, 1788, in, glasgow, scotland, the, glasgow, authorities, successfully, petitioned, the, government, to, pass, the, glasgow, police, act, establishing, the, city, of, glasgow, police, in, 1800, other, scottish, towns, soon, followed, suit, and, set, up, their, own, police, forces, through, acts, of, parliament, in, ireland, the, irish, constabulary, act, of, 1822, marked, the, beginning, of, the, royal, irish, constabulary, the, act, established, a, force, in, each, barony, with, chief, constables, and, inspectors, general, under, the, control, of, the, civil, administration, at, dublin, castle, by, 1841, this, force, numbered, over, 8, 600, men, in, 1797, patrick, colquhoun, was, able, to, persuade, the, west, indies, merchants, who, operated, at, the, pool, of, london, on, the, river, thames, to, establish, a, police, force, at, the, docks, to, prevent, rampant, theft, that, was, causing, annual, estimated, losses, of, 500, 000, worth, of, cargo, in, imports, alone, the, idea, of, a, police, as, it, then, existed, in, france, was, considered, as, a, potentially, undesirable, foreign, import, in, building, the, case, for, the, police, in, the, face, of, england, s, firm, anti, police, sentiment, colquhoun, framed, the, political, rationale, on, economic, indicators, to, show, that, a, police, dedicated, to, crime, prevention, was, perfectly, congenial, to, the, principle, of, the, british, constitution, moreover, he, went, so, far, as, to, praise, the, french, system, which, had, reached, the, greatest, degree, of, perfection, in, his, estimation, with, the, initial, investment, of, 4, 200, the, new, force, the, marine, police, began, with, about, 50, men, charged, with, policing, 33, 000, workers, in, the, river, trades, of, whom, colquhoun, claimed, 11, 000, were, known, criminals, and, on, the, game, the, force, was, part, funded, by, the, london, society, of, west, india, planters, and, merchants, the, force, was, a, success, after, its, first, year, and, his, men, had, established, their, worth, by, saving, 122, 000, worth, of, cargo, and, by, the, rescuing, of, several, lives, word, of, this, success, spread, quickly, and, the, government, passed, the, depredations, on, the, thames, act, 1800, on, 28, july, 1800, establishing, a, fully, funded, police, force, the, thames, river, police, together, with, new, laws, including, police, powers, now, the, oldest, police, force, in, the, world, colquhoun, published, a, book, on, the, experiment, the, commerce, and, policing, of, the, river, thames, it, found, receptive, audiences, far, outside, london, and, inspired, similar, forces, in, other, cities, notably, new, york, city, dublin, and, sydney, colquhoun, s, utilitarian, approach, to, the, problem, using, a, cost, benefit, argument, to, obtain, support, from, businesses, standing, to, benefit, allowed, him, to, achieve, what, henry, and, john, fielding, failed, for, their, bow, street, detectives, unlike, the, stipendiary, system, at, bow, street, the, river, police, were, full, time, salaried, officers, prohibited, from, taking, private, fees, his, other, contribution, was, the, concept, of, preventive, policing, his, police, were, to, act, as, a, highly, visible, deterrent, to, crime, by, their, permanent, presence, on, the, thames, london, was, fast, reaching, a, size, unprecedented, in, world, history, due, to, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, it, became, clear, that, the, locally, maintained, system, of, volunteer, constables, and, watchmen, was, ineffective, both, in, detecting, and, preventing, crime, a, parliamentary, committee, was, appointed, to, investigate, the, system, of, policing, in, london, upon, sir, robert, peel, being, appointed, as, home, secretary, in, 1822, he, established, a, second, and, more, effective, committee, and, acted, upon, its, findings, royal, assent, to, the, metropolitan, police, act, 1829, was, given, and, the, metropolitan, police, service, was, established, on, september, 29, 1829, in, london, peel, widely, regarded, as, the, father, of, modern, policing, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, social, and, legal, philosophy, of, jeremy, bentham, who, called, for, a, strong, and, centralised, but, politically, neutral, police, force, for, the, maintenance, of, social, order, for, the, protection, of, people, from, crime, and, to, act, as, a, visible, deterrent, to, urban, crime, and, disorder, peel, decided, to, standardise, the, police, force, as, an, official, paid, profession, to, organise, it, in, a, civilian, fashion, and, to, make, it, answerable, to, the, public, due, to, public, fears, concerning, the, deployment, of, the, military, in, domestic, matters, peel, organised, the, force, along, civilian, lines, rather, than, paramilitary, to, appear, neutral, the, uniform, was, deliberately, manufactured, in, blue, rather, than, red, which, was, then, a, military, colour, along, with, the, officers, being, armed, only, with, a, wooden, truncheon, and, a, rattle, to, signal, the, need, for, assistance, along, with, this, police, ranks, did, not, include, military, titles, with, the, exception, of, sergeant, to, distance, the, new, police, force, from, the, initial, public, view, of, it, as, a, new, tool, of, government, repression, peel, publicised, the, so, called, peelian, principles, which, set, down, basic, guidelines, for, ethical, policing, the, metropolitan, police, act, 1829, created, a, modern, police, force, by, limiting, the, purview, of, the, force, and, its, powers, and, envisioning, it, as, merely, an, organ, of, the, judicial, system, their, job, was, apolitical, to, maintain, the, peace, and, apprehend, criminals, for, the, courts, to, process, according, to, the, law, this, was, very, different, from, the, continental, model, of, the, police, force, that, had, been, developed, in, france, where, the, police, force, worked, within, the, parameters, of, the, absolutist, state, as, an, extension, of, the, authority, of, the, monarch, and, functioned, as, part, of, the, governing, state, in, 1863, the, metropolitan, police, were, issued, with, the, distinctive, custodian, helmet, and, in, 1884, they, switched, to, the, use, of, whistles, that, could, be, heard, from, much, further, away, the, metropolitan, police, became, a, model, for, the, police, forces, in, many, countries, including, the, united, states, and, most, of, the, british, empire, bobbies, can, still, be, found, in,

it, was, made, up, from, a, large, number, of, policing, and, military, units, operating, within, the, then, colony, of, new, south, wales, and, traces, its, links, back, to, the, royal, marines, the, passing, of, the, police, regulation, act, of, 1862, essentially, tightly, regulated, and, centralised, all, of, the, police, forces, operating, throughout, the, colony, of, new, south, wales, each,

author, makes, note, of, a, substantial, bibliography, was, produced, of, over, 4, 000, pieces, of, the, practice, of, polizeiwissenschaft, however, this, may, be, a, mistranslation, of, foucault, s, own, work, since, the, actual, source, of, magdalene, humpert, states, over, 14, 000, items, were, produced, from, the, 16th, century, dates, ranging, from, 1520, to, 1850, as, conceptualized, by, the, polizeiwissenschaft, according, to, foucault, the, police, had, an, administrative, economic, and, social, duty, procuring, abundance, it, was, in, charge, of, demographic, concerns, and, needed, to, be, incorporated, within, the, western, political, philosophy, system, of, raison, d, tat, and, therefore, giving, the, superficial, appearance, of, empowering, the, population, and, unwittingly, supervising, the, population, which, according, to, mercantilist, theory, was, to, be, the, main, strength, of, the, state, thus, its, functions, largely, overreached, simple, law, enforcement, activities, and, included, public, health, concerns, urban, planning, which, was, important, because, of, the, miasma, theory, of, disease, thus, cemeteries, were, moved, out, of, town, etc, and, surveillance, of, prices, the, concept, of, preventive, policing, or, policing, to, deter, crime, from, taking, place, gained, influence, in, the, late, 18th, century, police, magistrate, john, fielding, head, of, the, bow, street, runners, argued, that, it, is, much, better, to, prevent, even, one, man, from, being, a, rogue, than, apprehending, and, bringing, forty, to, justice, the, utilitarian, philosopher, jeremy, bentham, promoted, the, views, of, italian, marquis, cesare, beccaria, and, disseminated, a, translated, version, of, essay, on, crime, in, punishment, bentham, espoused, the, guiding, principle, of, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, it, is, better, to, prevent, crimes, than, to, punish, them, this, is, the, chief, aim, of, every, good, system, of, legislation, which, is, the, art, of, leading, men, to, the, greatest, possible, happiness, or, to, the, least, possible, misery, according, to, calculation, of, all, the, goods, and, evils, of, life, patrick, colquhoun, s, influential, work, a, treatise, on, the, police, of, the, metropolis, 1797, was, heavily, influenced, by, benthamite, thought, colquhoun, s, thames, river, police, was, founded, on, these, principles, and, in, contrast, to, the, bow, street, runners, acted, as, a, deterrent, by, their, continual, presence, on, the, riverfront, in, addition, to, being, able, to, intervene, if, they, spotted, a, crime, in, progress, edwin, chadwick, s, 1829, article, preventive, police, in, the, london, review, argued, that, prevention, ought, to, be, the, primary, concern, of, a, police, body, which, was, not, the, case, in, practice, the, reason, argued, chadwick, was, that, a, preventive, police, would, act, more, immediately, by, placing, difficulties, in, obtaining, the, objects, of, temptation, in, contrast, to, a, deterrent, of, punishment, a, preventive, police, force, would, deter, criminality, by, making, crime, cost, ineffective, crime, doesn, t, pay, in, the, second, draft, of, his, 1829, police, act, the, object, of, the, new, metropolitan, police, was, changed, by, robert, peel, to, the, principal, object, which, was, the, prevention, of, crime, later, historians, would, attribute, the, perception, of, england, s, appearance, of, orderliness, and, love, of, public, order, to, the, preventive, principle, entrenched, in, peel, s, police, system, development, of, modern, police, forces, around, the, world, was, contemporary, to, the, formation, of, the, state, later, defined, by, sociologist, max, weber, as, achieving, a, monopoly, on, the, legitimate, use, of, physical, force, and, which, was, primarily, exercised, by, the, police, and, the, military, marxist, theory, situates, the, development, of, the, modern, state, as, part, of, the, rise, of, capitalism, in, which, the, police, are, one, component, of, the, bourgeoisie, s, repressive, apparatus, for, subjugating, the, working, class, by, contrast, the, peelian, principles, argue, that, the, power, of, the, police, is, dependent, on, public, approval, of, their, existence, actions, and, behavior, a, philosophy, known, as, policing, by, consent, police, forces, include, both, preventive, uniformed, police, and, detectives, terminology, varies, from, country, to, country, police, functions, include, protecting, life, and, property, enforcing, criminal, law, criminal, investigations, regulating, traffic, crowd, control, public, safety, duties, civil, defense, emergency, management, searching, for, missing, persons, lost, property, and, other, duties, concerned, with, public, order, regardless, of, size, police, forces, are, generally, organized, as, a, hierarchy, with, multiple, ranks, the, exact, structures, and, the, names, of, rank, vary, considerably, by, country, the, police, who, wear, uniforms, make, up, the, majority, of, a, police, service, s, personnel, their, main, duty, is, to, respond, to, calls, for, service, when, not, responding, to, these, calls, they, do, work, aimed, at, preventing, crime, such, as, patrols, the, uniformed, police, are, known, by, varying, names, such, as, preventive, police, the, uniform, branch, division, administrative, police, order, police, the, patrol, bureau, division, or, patrol, in, australia, and, the, united, kingdom, patrol, personnel, are, also, known, as, general, duties, officers, atypically, brazil, s, preventive, police, are, known, as, military, police, as, stated, by, the, name, uniformed, police, wear, uniforms, they, perform, functions, that, require, an, immediate, recognition, of, an, officer, s, legal, authority, and, a, potential, need, for, force, most, commonly, this, means, intervening, to, stop, a, crime, in, progress, and, securing, the, scene, of, a, crime, that, has, already, happened, besides, dealing, with, crime, these, officers, may, also, manage, and, monitor, traffic, carry, out, community, policing, duties, maintain, order, at, public, events, or, carry, out, searches, for, missing, people, in, 2012, the, latter, accounted, for, 14, of, police, time, in, the, united, kingdom, as, most, of, these, duties, must, be, available, as, a, 24, 7, service, uniformed, police, are, required, to, do, shift, work, police, detectives, are, responsible, for, investigations, and, detective, work, detectives, may, be, called, investigations, police, judiciary, judicial, police, or, criminal, police, in, the, united, kingdom, they, are, often, referred, to, by, the, name, of, their, department, the, criminal, investigation, department, detectives, typically, make, up, roughly, 15, 25, of, a, police, service, s, personnel, detectives, in, contrast, to, uniformed, police, typically, wear, business, styled, attire, in, bureaucratic, and, investigative, functions, where, a, uniformed, presence, would, be, either, a, distraction, or, intimidating, but, a, need, to, establish, police, authority, still, exists, plainclothes, officers, dress, in, attire, consistent, with, that, worn, by, the, general, public, for, purposes, of, blending, in, in, some, cases, police, are, assigned, to, work, undercover, where, they, conceal, their, police, identity, to, investigate, crimes, such, as, organized, crime, or, narcotics, crime, that, are, unsolvable, by, other, means, in, some, cases, this, type, of, policing, shares, aspects, with, espionage, the, relationship, between, detective, and, uniformed, branches, varies, by, country, in, the, united, states, there, is, high, variation, within, the, country, itself, many, american, police, departments, require, detectives, to, spend, some, time, on, temporary, assignments, in, the, patrol, division, the, argument, is, that, rotating, officers, helps, the, detectives, to, better, understand, the, uniformed, officers, work, to, promote, cross, training, in, a, wider, variety, of, skills, and, prevent, cliques, that, can, contribute, to, corruption, or, other, unethical, behavior, conversely, some, countries, regard, detective, work, as, being, an, entirely, separate, profession, with, detectives, working, in, separate, agencies, and, recruited, without, having, to, serve, in, uniform, a, common, compromise, in, english, speaking, countries, is, that, most, detectives, are, recruited, from, the, uniformed, branch, but, once, qualified, they, tend, to, spend, the, rest, of, their, careers, in, the, detective, branch, another, point, of, variation, is, whether, detectives, have, extra, status, in, some, forces, such, as, the, new, york, police, department, and, philadelphia, police, department, a, regular, detective, holds, a, higher, rank, than, a, regular, police, officer, in, others, such, as, british, police, and, canadian, police, a, regular, detective, has, equal, status, with, regular, uniformed, officers, officers, still, have, to, take, exams, to, move, to, the, detective, branch, but, the, move, is, regarded, as, being, a, specialization, rather, than, a, promotion, police, services, often, include, part, time, or, volunteer, officers, some, of, whom, have, other, jobs, outside, policing, these, may, be, paid, positions, or, entirely, volunteer, these, are, known, by, a, variety, of, names, such, as, reserves, auxiliary, police, or, special, constables, other, volunteer, organizations, work, with, the, police, and, perform, some, of, their, duties, groups, in, the, u, s, including, the, retired, and, senior, volunteer, program, community, emergency, response, team, and, the, boy, scouts, police, explorers, provide, training, traffic, and, crowd, control, disaster, response, and, other, policing, duties, in, the, u, s, the, volunteers, in, police, service, program, assists, over, 200, 000, volunteers, in, almost, 2, 000, programs, volunteers, may, also, work, on, the, support, staff, examples, of, these, schemes, are, volunteers, in, police, service, in, the, us, police, support, volunteers, in, the, uk, and, volunteers, in, policing, in, new, south, wales, specialized, preventive, and, detective, groups, or, specialist, investigation, departments, exist, within, many, law, enforcement, organizations, either, for, dealing, with, particular, types, of, crime, such, as, traffic, law, enforcement, k9, use, of, police, dogs, crash, investigation, homicide, or, fraud, or, for, situations, requiring, specialized, skills, such, as, underwater, search, aviation, explosive, disposal, bomb, squad, and, computer, crime, most, larger, jurisdictions, employ, police, tactical, units, specially, selected, and, trained, paramilitary, units, with, specialized, equipment, weapons, and, training, for, the, purposes, of, dealing, with, particularly, violent, situations, beyond, the, capability, of, a, patrol, officer, response, including, standoffs, counterterrorism, and, rescue, operations, in, counterinsurgency, type, campaigns, select, and, specially, trained, units, of, police, armed, and, equipped, as, light, infantry, have, been, designated, as, police, field, forces, who, perform, paramilitary, type, patrols, and, ambushes, whilst, retaining, their, police, powers, in, areas, that, were, highly, dangerous, because, their, situational, mandate, typically, focuses, on, removing, innocent, bystanders, from, dangerous, people, and, dangerous, situations, not, violent, resolution, they, are, often, equipped, with, non, lethal, tactical, tools, like, chemical, agents, stun, grenades, and, rubber, bullets, the, specialist, firearms, command, mo19, of, the, metropolitan, police, in, london, is, a, group, of, armed, police, used, in, dangerous, situations, including, hostage, taking, armed, robbery, assault, and, terrorism, police, may, have, administrative, duties, that, are, not, directly, related, to, enforcing, the, law, such, as, issuing, firearms, licenses, the, extent, that, police, have, these, functions, varies, among, countries, with, police, in, france, germany, and, other, continental, european, countries, handling, such, tasks, to, a, greater, extent, than, british, counterparts, military, police, may, refer, to, some, jurisdictions, with, religious, laws, may, have, dedicated, religious, police, to, enforce, said, laws, these, religious, police, forces, which, may, operate, either, as, a, unit, of, a, wider, police, force, or, as, an, independent, agency, may, only, have, jurisdiction, over, members, of, said, religion, or, they, may, have, the, ability, to, enforce, religious, customs, nationwide, regardless, of, individual, religious, beliefs, religious, police, may, enforce, social, norms, gender, roles, dress, codes, and, dietary, laws, per, religious, doctrine, and, laws, and, may, also, prohibit, practices, that, run, contrary, to, said, doctrine, such, as, atheism, proselytism, homosexuality, socialization, between, different, genders, business, operations, during, religious, periods, or, events, such, as, salah, or, the, sabbath, or, the, sale, and, possession, of, offending, material, ranging, from, pornography, to, foreign, media, forms, of, religious, law, enforcement, were, relatively, common, in, historical, religious, civilizations, but, eventually, declined, in, favor, of, religious, tolerance, and, pluralism, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, religious, police, in, the, modern, world, are, islamic, religious, police, which, enforce, the, application, of, sharia, islamic, religious, law, as, of, 2018, there, are, eight, islamic, countries, that, maintain, islamic, religious, police, afghanistan, iran, iraq, mauritania, pakistan, saudi, arabia, sudan, and, yemen, some, forms, of, religious, police, may, not, enforce, religious, law, but, rather, suppress, religion, or, religious, extremism, this, is, often, done, for, ideological, reasons, for, example, communist, states, such, as, china, and, vietnam, have, historically, suppressed, and, tightly, controlled, religions, such, as, christianity, secret, police, organizations, are, typically, used, to, suppress, dissidents, for, engaging, in, non, politically, correct, communications, and, activities, which, are, deemed, counter, productive, to, what, the, state, and, related, establishment, promote, secret, police, interventions, to, stop, such, activities, are, often, illegal, and, are, designed, to, debilitate, in, various, ways, the, people, targeted, in, order, to, limit, or, stop, outright, their, ability, to, act, in, a, non, politically, correct, manner, the, methods, employed, may, involve, spying, various, acts, of, deception, intimidation, framing, false, imprisonment, false, incarceration, under, mental, health, legislation, and, physical, violence, countries, widely, reported, to, use, secret, police, organizations, include, china, the, ministry, of, state, security, and, north, korea, the, ministry, of, state, security, police, forces, are, usually, organized, and, funded, by, some, level, of, government, the, level, of, government, responsible, for, policing, varies, from, place, to, place, and, may, be, at, the, national, regional, or, local, level, some, countries, have, police, forces, that, serve, the, same, territory, with, their, jurisdiction, depending, on, the, type, of, crime, or, other, circumstances, other, countries, such, as, austria, chile, israel, new, zealand, the, philippines, south, africa, and, sweden, have, a, single, national, police, force, in, some, places, with, multiple, national, police, forces, one, common, arrangement, is, to, have, a, civilian, police, force, and, a, paramilitary, gendarmerie, such, as, the, police, nationale, and, national, gendarmerie, in, france, the, french, policing, system, spread, to, other, countries, through, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, french, colonial, empire, another, example, is, the, polic, a, nacional, and, guardia, civil, in, spain, in, both, france, and, spain, the, civilian, force, polices, urban, areas, and, the, paramilitary, force, polices, rural, areas, italy, has, a, similar, arrangement, with, the, polizia, di, stato, and, carabinieri, though, their, jurisdictions, overlap, more, some, countries, have, separate, agencies, for, uniformed, police, and, detectives, such, as, the, military, police, and, civil, police, in, brazil, and, the, carabineros, and, investigations, police, in, chile, other, countries, have, sub, national, police, forces, but, for, the, most, part, their, jurisdictions, do, not, overlap, in, many, countries, especially, federations, there, may, be, two, or, more, tiers, of, police, force, each, serving, different, levels, of, government, and, enforcing, different, subsets, of, the, law, in, australia, and, germany, the, majority, of, policing, is, carried, out, by, state, i, e, provincial, police, forces, which, are, supplemented, by, a, federal, police, force, though, not, a, federation, the, united, kingdom, has, a, similar, arrangement, where, policing, is, primarily, the, responsibility, of, a, regional, police, force, and, specialist, units, exist, at, the, national, level, in, canada, the, royal, canadian, mounted, police, rcmp, are, the, federal, police, while, municipalities, can, decide, whether, to, run, a, local, police, service, or, to, contract, local, policing, duties, to, a, larger, one, most, urban, areas, have, a, local, police, service, while, most, rural, areas, contract, it, to, the, rcmp, or, to, the, provincial, police, in, ontario, and, quebec, the, united, states, has, a, highly, decentralized, and, fragmented, system, of, law, enforcement, with, over, 17, 000, state, and, local, law, enforcement, agencies, these, agencies, include, local, police, county, law, enforcement, often, in, the, form, of, a, sheriff, s, office, or, county, police, state, police, and, federal, law, enforcement, agencies, federal, agencies, such, as, the, fbi, only, have, jurisdiction, over, federal, crimes, or, those, that, involve, more, than, one, state, other, federal, agencies, have, jurisdiction, over, a, specific, type, of, crime, examples, include, the, federal, protective, service, which, patrols, and, protects, government, buildings, the, postal, inspection, service, which, protect, united, states, postal, service, facilities, vehicles, and, items, the, park, police, which, protect, national, parks, and, amtrak, police, which, patrol, amtrak, stations, and, trains, there, are, also, some, government, agencies, and, uniformed, services, that, perform, police, functions, in, addition, to, other, duties, such, as, the, coast, guard, most, countries, are, members, of, the, international, criminal, police, organization, interpol, established, to, detect, and, fight, transnational, crime, and, provide, for, international, co, operation, and, co, ordination, of, other, police, activities, such, as, notifying, relatives, of, the, death, of, foreign, nationals, interpol, does, not, conduct, investigations, or, arrests, by, itself, but, only, serves, as, a, central, point, for, information, on, crime, suspects, and, criminals, political, crimes, are, excluded, from, its, competencies, the, terms, international, policing, transnational, policing, and, or, global, policing, began, to, be, used, from, the, early, 1990s, onwards, to, describe, forms, of, policing, that, transcended, the, boundaries, of, the, sovereign, nation, state, these, terms, refer, in, variable, ways, to, practices, and, forms, for, policing, that, in, some, sense, transcend, national, borders, this, includes, a, variety, of, practices, but, international, police, cooperation, criminal, intelligence, exchange, between, police, agencies, working, in, different, nation, states, and, police, development, aid, to, weak, failed, or, failing, states, are, the, three, types, that, have, received, the, most, scholarly, attention, historical, studies, reveal, that, policing, agents, have, undertaken, a, variety, of, cross, border, police, missions, for, many, years, for, example, in, the, 19th, century, a, number, of, european, policing, agencies, undertook, cross, border, surveillance, because, of, concerns, about, anarchist, agitators, and, other, political, radicals, a, notable, example, of, this, was, the, occasional, surveillance, by, prussian, police, of, karl, marx, during, the, years, he, remained, resident, in, london, the, interests, of, public, police, agencies, in, cross, border, co, operation, in, the, control, of, political, radicalism, and, ordinary, law, crime, were, primarily, initiated, in, europe, which, eventually, led, to, the, establishment, of, interpol, before, world, war, ii, there, are, also, many, interesting, examples, of, cross, border, policing, under, private, auspices, and, by, municipal, police, forces, that, date, back, to, the, 19th, century, it, has, been, established, that, modern, policing, has, transgressed, national, boundaries, from, time, to, time, almost, from, its, inception, it, is, also, generally, agreed, that, in, the, post, cold, war, era, this, type, of, practice, became, more, significant, and, frequent, few, empirical, works, on, the, practices, of, inter, transnational, information, and, intelligence, sharing, have, been, undertaken, a, notable, exception, is, james, sheptycki, s, study, of, police, cooperation, in, the, english, channel, region, which, provides, a, systematic, content, analysis, of, information, exchange, files, and, a, description, of, how, these, transnational, information, and, intelligence, exchanges, are, transformed, into, police, casework, the, study, showed, that, transnational, police, information, sharing, was, routinized, in, the, cross, channel, region, from, 1968, on, the, basis, of, agreements, directly, between, the, police, agencies, and, without, any, formal, agreement, between, the, countries, concerned, by, 1992, with, the, signing, of, the, schengen, treaty, which, formalized, aspects, of, police, information, exchange, across, the, territory, of, the, european, union, there, were, worries, that, much, if, not, all, of, this, intelligence, sharing, was, opaque, raising, questions, about, the, efficacy, of, the, accountability, mechanisms, governing, police, information, sharing, in, europe, studies, of, this, kind, outside, of, europe, are, even, rarer, so, it, is, difficult, to, make, generalizations, but, one, small, scale, study, that, compared, transnational, police, information, and, intelligence, sharing, practices, at, specific, cross, border, locations, in, north, america, and, europe, confirmed, that, the, low, visibility, of, police, information, and, intelligence, sharing, was, a, common, feature, intelligence, led, policing, is, now, common, practice, in, most, advanced, countries, and, it, is, likely, that, police, intelligence, sharing, and, information, exchange, has, a, common, morphology, around, the, world, james, sheptycki, has, analyzed, the, effects, of, the, new, information, technologies, on, the, organization, of, policing, intelligence, and, suggests, that, a, number, of, organizational, pathologies, have, arisen, that, make, the, functioning, of, security, intelligence, processes, in, transnational, policing, deeply, problematic, he, argues, that, transnational, police, information, circuits, help, to, compose, the, panic, scenes, of, the, security, control, society, the, paradoxical, effect, is, that, the, harder, policing, agencies, work, to, produce, security, the, greater, are, feelings, of, insecurity, police, development, aid, to, weak, failed, or, failing, states, is, another, form, of, transnational, policing, that, has, garnered, attention, this, form, of, transnational, policing, plays, an, increasingly, important, role, in, united, nations, peacekeeping, and, this, looks, set, to, grow, in, the, years, ahead, especially, as, the, international, community, seeks, to, develop, the, rule, of, law, and, reform, security, institutions, in, states, recovering, from, conflict, with, transnational, police, development, aid, the, imbalances, of, power, between, donors, and, recipients, are, stark, and, there, are, questions, about, the, applicability, and, transportability, of, policing, models, between, jurisdictions, one, topic, concerns, making, transnational, policing, institutions, democratically, accountable, according, to, the, global, accountability, report, for, 2007, interpol, had, the, lowest, scores, in, its, category, igos, coming, in, tenth, with, a, score, of, 22, on, overall, accountability, capabilities, a, police, force, may, establish, its, presence, in, a, foreign, country, with, or, without, the, permission, of, the, host, state, in, the, case, of, china, and, the, ruling, communist, party, this, has, involved, setting, up, unofficial, police, service, stations, around, the, world, and, using, coercive, means, to, influence, the, behaviour, of, members, of, the, chinese, diaspora, and, especially, those, who, hold, chinese, citizenship, political, dissidents, have, been, harassed, and, intimidated, in, a, form, of, transnational, repression, and, convinced, to, return, to, china, many, of, these, actions, were, illegal, in, the, states, where, they, occurred, such, police, stations, have, been, established, in, dozens, of, countries, around, the, world, with, some, such, as, the, uk, and, the, us, forcing, them, to, close, in, many, jurisdictions, police, officers, carry, firearms, primarily, handguns, in, the, normal, course, of, their, duties, in, the, united, kingdom, except, northern, ireland, iceland, ireland, norway, new, zealand, and, malta, with, the, exception, of, specialist, units, officers, do, not, carry, firearms, as, a, matter, of, course, norwegian, police, carry, firearms, in, their, vehicles, but, not, on, their, duty, belts, and, must, obtain, authorization, before, the, weapons, can, be, removed, from, the, vehicle, police, often, have, specialized, units, for, handling, armed, offenders, or, dangerous, situations, where, combat, is, likely, such, as, police, tactical, units, or, authorised, firearms, officers, in, some, jurisdictions, depending, on, the, circumstances, police, can, call, on, the, military, for, assistance, as, military, aid, to, the, civil, power, is, an, aspect, of, many, armed, forces, perhaps, the, most, high, profile, example, of, this, was, in, 1980, when, the, british, army, s, special, air, service, was, deployed, to, resolve, the, iranian, embassy, siege, on, behalf, of, the, metropolitan, police, they, can, also, be, armed, with, non, lethal, more, accurately, known, as, less, than, lethal, or, less, lethal, given, that, they, can, still, be, deadly, weaponry, particularly, for, riot, control, or, to, inflict, pain, against, a, resistant, suspect, to, force, them, to, surrender, without, lethally, wounding, them, non, lethal, weapons, include, batons, tear, gas, riot, control, agents, rubber, bullets, riot, shields, water, cannons, and, electroshock, weapons, police, officers, typically, carry, handcuffs, to, restrain, suspects, the, use, of, firearms, or, deadly, force, is, typically, a, last, resort, only, to, be, used, when, necessary, to, save, the, lives, of, others, or, themselves, though, some, jurisdictions, such, as, brazil, allow, its, use, against, fleeing, felons, and, escaped, convicts, police, officers, in, the, united, states, are, generally, allowed, to, use, deadly, force, if, they, believe, their, life, is, in, danger, a, policy, that, has, been, criticized, for, being, vague, south, african, police, have, a, shoot, to, kill, policy, which, allows, officers, to, use, deadly, force, against, any, person, who, poses, a, significant, threat, to, them, with, the, country, having, one, of, the, highest, rates, of, violent, crime, president, jacob, zuma, stated, that, south, africa, needs, to, handle, crime, differently, from, other, countries, modern, police, forces, make, extensive, use, of, two, way, radio, communications, equipment, carried, both, on, the, person, and, installed, in, vehicles, to, coordinate, their, work, share, information, and, get, help, quickly, vehicle, installed, mobile, data, terminals, enhance, the, ability, of, police, communications, enabling, easier, dispatching, of, calls, criminal, background, checks, on, persons, of, interest, to, be, completed, in, a, matter, of, seconds, and, updating, officers, daily, activity, log, and, other, required, reports, on, a, real, time, basis, other, common, pieces, of, police, equipment, include, flashlights, whistles, police, notebooks, and, ticket, books, or, citations, some, police, departments, have, developed, advanced, computerized, data, display, and, communication, systems, to, bring, real, time, data, to, officers, one, example, being, the, nypd, s, domain, awareness, system, police, vehicles, are, used, for, detaining, patrolling, and, transporting, over, wide, areas, that, an, officer, could, not, effectively, cover, otherwise, the, average, police, car, used, for, standard, patrol, is, a, four, door, sedan, suv, or, cuv, often, modified, by, the, manufacturer, or, police, force, s, fleet, services, to, provide, better, performance, pickup, trucks, off, road, vehicles, and, vans, are, often, used, in, utility, roles, though, in, some, jurisdictions, or, situations, such, as, those, where, dirt, roads, are, common, off, roading, is, required, or, the, nature, of, the, officer, s, assignment, necessitates, it, they, may, be, used, as, standard, patrol, cars, sports, cars, are, typically, not, used, by, police, due, to, cost, and, maintenance, issues, though, those, that, are, used, are, typically, only, assigned, to, traffic, enforcement, or, community, policing, and, are, rarely, if, ever, assigned, to, standard, patrol, or, authorized, to, respond, to, dangerous, calls, such, as, armed, calls, or, pursuits, where, the, likelihood, of, the, vehicle, being, damaged, or, destroyed, is, high, police, vehicles, are, usually, marked, with, appropriate, symbols, and, equipped, with, sirens, and, flashing, emergency, lights, to, make, others, aware, of, police, presence, or, response, in, most, jurisdictions, police, vehicles, with, their, sirens, and, emergency, lights, on, have, right, of, way, in, traffic, while, in, other, jurisdictions, emergency, lights, may, be, kept, on, while, patrolling, to, ensure, ease, of, visibility, unmarked, or, undercover, police, vehicles, are, used, primarily, for, traffic, enforcement, or, apprehending, criminals, without, alerting, them, to, their, presence, the, use, of, unmarked, police, vehicles, for, traffic, enforcement, is, controversial, with, the, state, of, new, york, banning, this, practice, in, 1996, on, the, grounds, that, it, endangered, motorists, who, might, be, pulled, over, by, police, impersonators, motorcycles, having, historically, been, a, mainstay, in, police, fleets, are, commonly, used, particularly, in, locations, that, a, car, may, not, be, able, to, reach, to, control, potential, public, order, situations, involving, meetings, of, motorcyclists, and, often, in, police, escorts, where, motorcycle, police, officers, can, quickly, clear, a, path, for, escorted, vehicles, bicycle, patrols, are, used, in, some, areas, often, downtown, areas, or, parks, because, they, allow, for, wider, and, faster, area, coverage, than, officers, on, foot, bicycles, are, also, commonly, used, by, riot, police, to, create, makeshift, barricades, against, protesters, police, aviation, consists, of, helicopters, and, fixed, wing, aircraft, while, police, watercraft, tend, to, consist, of, rhibs, motorboats, and, patrol, boats, swat, vehicles, are, used, by, police, tactical, units, and, often, consist, of, four, wheeled, armored, personnel, carriers, used, to, transport, tactical, teams, while, providing, armored, cover, equipment, storage, space, or, makeshift, battering, ram, capabilities, these, vehicles, are, typically, not, armed, and, do, not, patrol, and, are, only, used, to, transport, mobile, command, posts, may, also, be, used, by, some, police, forces, to, establish, identifiable, command, centers, at, the, scene, of, major, situations, police, cars, may, contain, issued, long, guns, ammunition, for, issued, weapons, less, lethal, weaponry, riot, control, equipment, traffic, cones, road, flares, physical, barricades, or, barricade, tape, fire, extinguishers, first, aid, kits, or, defibrillators, the, advent, of, the, police, car, two, way, radio, and, telephone, in, the, early, 20th, century, transformed, policing, into, a, reactive, strategy, that, focused, on, responding, to, calls, for, service, away, from, their, beat, with, this, transformation, police, command, and, control, became, more, centralized, in, the, united, states, august, vollmer, introduced, other, reforms, including, education, requirements, for, police, officers, o, w, wilson, a, student, of, vollmer, helped, reduce, corruption, and, introduce, professionalism, in, wichita, kansas, and, later, in, the, chicago, police, department, strategies, employed, by, o, w, wilson, included, rotating, officers, from, community, to, community, to, reduce, their, vulnerability, to, corruption, establishing, of, a, non, partisan, police, board, to, help, govern, the, police, force, a, strict, merit, system, for, promotions, within, the, department, and, an, aggressive, recruiting, drive, with, higher, police, salaries, to, attract, professionally, qualified, officers, during, the, professionalism, era, of, policing, law, enforcement, agencies, concentrated, on, dealing, with, felonies, and, other, serious, crime, and, conducting, visible, car, patrols, in, between, rather, than, broader, focus, on, crime, prevention, the, kansas, city, preventive, patrol, study, in, the, early, 1970s, showed, flaws, in, using, visible, car, patrols, for, crime, prevention, it, found, that, aimless, car, patrols, did, little, to, deter, crime, and, often, went, unnoticed, by, the, public, patrol, officers, in, cars, had, insufficient, contact, and, interaction, with, the, community, leading, to, a, social, rift, between, the, two, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, many, law, enforcement, agencies, began, to, adopt, community, policing, strategies, and, others, adopted, problem, oriented, policing, broken, windows, policing, was, another, related, approach, introduced, in, the, 1980s, by, james, q, wilson, and, george, l, kelling, who, suggested, that, police, should, pay, greater, attention, to, minor, quality, of, life, offenses, and, disorderly, conduct, the, concept, behind, this, method, is, simple, broken, windows, graffiti, and, other, physical, destruction, or, degradation, of, property, create, an, environment, in, which, crime, and, disorder, is, more, likely, the, presence, of, broken, windows, and, graffiti, sends, a, message, that, authorities, do, not, care, and, are, not, trying, to, correct, problems, in, these, areas, therefore, correcting, these, small, problems, prevents, more, serious, criminal, activity, the, theory, was, popularised, in, the, early, 1990s, by, police, chief, william, j, bratton, and, new, york, city, mayor, rudy, giuliani, it, was, emulated, in, 2010s, in, kazakhstan, through, zero, tolerance, policing, yet, it, failed, to, produce, meaningful, results, in, this, country, because, citizens, distrusted, police, while, state, leaders, preferred, police, loyalty, over, police, good, behavior, building, upon, these, earlier, models, intelligence, led, policing, has, also, become, an, important, strategy, intelligence, led, policing, and, problem, oriented, policing, are, complementary, strategies, both, of, which, involve, systematic, use, of, information, although, it, still, lacks, a, universally, accepted, definition, the, crux, of, intelligence, led, policing, is, an, emphasis, on, the, collection, and, analysis, of, information, to, guide, police, operations, rather, than, the, reverse, a, related, development, is, evidence, based, policing, in, a, similar, vein, to, evidence, based, policy, evidence, based, policing, is, the, use, of, controlled, experiments, to, find, which, methods, of, policing, are, more, effective, leading, advocates, of, evidence, based, policing, include, the, criminologist, lawrence, w, sherman, and, philanthropist, jerry, lee, findings, from, controlled, experiments, include, the, minneapolis, domestic, violence, experiment, evidence, that, patrols, deter, crime, if, they, are, concentrated, in, crime, hotspots, and, that, restricting, police, powers, to, shoot, suspects, does, not, cause, an, increase, in, crime, or, violence, against, police, officers, use, of, experiments, to, assess, the, usefulness, of, strategies, has, been, endorsed, by, many, police, services, and, institutions, including, the, u, s, police, foundation, and, the, uk, college, of, policing, in, many, nations, criminal, procedure, law, has, been, developed, to, regulate, officers, discretion, so, that, they, do, not, arbitrarily, or, unjustly, exercise, their, powers, of, arrest, search, and, seizure, and, use, of, force, in, the, united, states, miranda, v, arizona, led, to, the, widespread, use, of, miranda, warnings, or, constitutional, warnings, in, miranda, the, court, created, safeguards, against, self, incriminating, statements, made, after, an, arrest, the, court, held, that, the, prosecution, may, not, use, statements, whether, exculpatory, or, inculpatory, stemming, from, questioning, initiated, by, law, enforcement, officers, after, a, person, has, been, taken, into, custody, or, otherwise, deprived, of, his, freedom, of, action, in, any, significant, way, unless, it, demonstrates, the, use, of, procedural, safeguards, effective, to, secure, the, fifth, amendment, s, privilege, against, self, incrimination, police, in, the, united, states, are, also, prohibited, from, holding, criminal, suspects, for, more, than, a, reasonable, amount, of, time, usually, 24, 48, hours, before, arraignment, using, torture, abuse, or, physical, threats, to, extract, confessions, using, excessive, force, to, effect, an, arrest, and, searching, suspects, bodies, or, their, homes, without, a, warrant, obtained, upon, a, showing, of, probable, cause, the, four, exceptions, to, the, constitutional, requirement, of, a, search, warrant, are, in, terry, v, ohio, 1968, the, court, divided, seizure, into, two, parts, the, investigatory, stop, and, arrest, the, court, further, held, that, during, an, investigatory, stop, a, police, officer, s, search, confined, to, what, minimally, necessary, to, determine, whether, is, armed, and, the, intrusion, which, made, for, the, sole, purpose, of, protecting, himself, and, others, nearby, confined, to, ascertaining, the, presence, of, weapons, u, s, supreme, court, before, terry, every, police, encounter, constituted, an, arrest, giving, the, police, officer, the, full, range, of, search, authority, search, authority, during, a, terry, stop, investigatory, stop, is, limited, to, weapons, only, using, deception, for, confessions, is, permitted, but, not, coercion, there, are, exceptions, or, exigent, circumstances, such, as, an, articulated, need, to, disarm, a, suspect, or, searching, a, suspect,

but, generally, have, greater, powers, they, may, for, example, legally, search, any, suspect, who, has, been, arrested, or, their, vehicles, home, or, business, premises, without, a, warrant, and, may, seize, anything, they, find, in, a, search, as, evidence, all, police, officers, in, the, united, kingdom, whatever, their, actual, rank, are, constables, in, terms, of, their, legal, position, this, means, that, a, newly, appointed, constable, has, the, same, arrest, powers, as, a, chief, constable, or, commissioner, however, certain, higher, ranks, have, additional, powers, to, authorize, certain, aspects, of, police, operations, such, as, a, power, to, authorize, a, search, of, a, suspect, s, house, section, 18, pace, in, england, and, wales, by, an, officer, of, the, rank, of, inspector, or, the, power, to, authorize, a, suspect, s, detention, beyond, 24, hours, by, a, superintendent, police, services, commonly, include, units, for, investigating, crimes, committed, by, the, police, themselves, these, units, are, typically, called, internal, affairs, or, inspectorate, general, units, in, some, countries, separate, organizations, outside, the, police, exist, for, such, purposes, such, as, the, british, independent, office, for, police, conduct, however, due, to, american, laws, around, qualified, immunity, it, has, become, increasingly, difficult, to, investigate, and, charge, police, misconduct, and, crimes, likewise, some, state, and, local, jurisdictions, for, example, springfield, illinois, have, similar, outside, review, organizations, the, police, service, of, northern, ireland, is, investigated, by, the, police, ombudsman, for, northern, ireland, an, external, agency, set, up, as, a, result, of, the, patten, report, into, policing, the, province, in, the, republic, of, ireland, the, garda, s, och, na, is, investigated, by, the, garda, s, och, na, ombudsman, commission, an, independent, commission, that, replaced, the, garda, complaints, board, in, may, 2007, the, special, investigations, unit, of, ontario, canada, is, one, of, only, a, few, civilian, agencies, around, the, world, responsible, for, investigating, circumstances, involving, police, and, others, that, have, resulted, in, a, death, serious, injury, or, allegations, of, sexual, assault, the, agency, has, made, allegations, of, insufficient, cooperation, from, various, police, services, hindering, their, investigations, in, hong, kong, any, allegations, of, corruption, within, the, police, are, investigated, by, the, independent, commission, against, corruption, and, the, independent, police, complaints, council, two, agencies, which, are, independent, of, the, police, force, in, the, united, states, body, cameras, are, often, worn, by, police, officers, to, record, their, interactions, with, the, public, and, each, other, providing, audiovisual, recorded, evidence, for, review, in, the, event, an, officer, or, agency, s, actions, are, investigated, police, forces, also, find, themselves, under, criticism, for, their, use, of, force, particularly, deadly, force, specifically, tension, increases, when, a, police, officer, of, one, ethnic, group, harms, or, kills, a, suspect, of, another, one, in, the, united, states, such, events, occasionally, spark, protests, and, accusations, of, racism, against, police, and, allegations, that, police, departments, practice, racial, profiling, similar, incidents, have, also, happened, in, other, countries, in, the, united, states, since, the, 1960s, concern, over, such, issues, has, increasingly, weighed, upon, law, enforcement, agencies, courts, and, legislatures, at, every, level, of, government, incidents, such, as, the, 1965, watts, riots, the, videotaped, 1991, beating, by, lapd, officers, of, rodney, king, and, the, riot, following, their, acquittal, have, been, suggested, by, some, people, to, be, evidence, that, u, s, police, are, dangerously, lacking, in, appropriate, controls, the, fact, that, this, trend, has, occurred, contemporaneously, with, the, rise, of, the, civil, rights, movement, the, war, on, drugs, and, a, precipitous, rise, in, violent, crime, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1990s, has, made, questions, surrounding, the, role, administration, and, scope, of, police, authority, increasingly, complicated, police, departments, and, the, local, governments, that, oversee, them, in, some, jurisdictions, have, attempted, to, mitigate, some, of, these, issues, through, community, outreach, programs, and, community, policing, to, make, the, police, more, accessible, to, the, concerns, of, local, communities, by, working, to, increase, hiring, diversity, by, updating, training, of, police, in, their, responsibilities, to, the, community, and, under, the, law, and, by, increased, oversight, within, the, department, or, by, civilian, commissions, in, cases, in, which, such, measures, have, been, lacking, or, absent, civil, lawsuits, have, been, brought, by, the, united, states, department, of, justice, against, local, law, enforcement, agencies, authorized, under, the, 1994, violent, crime, control, and, law, enforcement, act, this, has, compelled, local, departments, to, make, organizational, changes, enter, into, consent, decree, settlements, to, adopt, such, measures, and, submit, to, oversight, by, the, justice, department, in, may, 2020, a, global, movement, to, increase, scrutiny, of, police, violence, grew, in, popularity, starting, in, minneapolis, minnesota, with, the, murder, of, george, floyd, calls, for, defunding, of, the, police, and, full, abolition, of, the, police, gained, larger, support, in, the, united, states, as, more, criticized, systemic, racism, in, policing, critics, also, argue, that, sometimes, this, abuse, of, force, or, power, can, extend, to, police, officer, civilian, life, as, well, for, example, critics, note, that, women, in, around, 40, of, police, officer, families, have, experienced, domestic, violence, and, that, police, officers, are, convicted, of, misdemeanors, and, felonies, at, a, rate, of, more, than, six, times, higher, than, concealed, carry, weapon, permit, holders, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, has, consistently, ruled, that, law, enforcement, officers, in, the, u, s, have, no, duty, to, protect, any, individual, only, to, enforce, the, law, in, general, this, is, despite, the, motto, of, many, police, departments, in, the, u, s, being, a, variation, of, protect, and, serve, regardless, many, departments, generally, expect, their, officers, to, protect, individuals, the, first, case, to, make, such, a, ruling, was, south, v, state, of, maryland, in, 1855, and, the, most, recent, was, town, of, castle, rock, v, gonzales, in, 2005, in, contrast, the, police, are, entitled, to, protect, private, rights, in, some, jurisdictions, to, ensure, that, the, police, would, not, interfere, in, the, regular, competencies, of, the, courts, of, law, some, police, acts, require, that, the, police, may, only, interfere, in, such, cases, where, protection, from, courts, cannot, be, obtained, in, time, and, where, without, interference, of, the, police, the, realization, of, the, private, right, would, be, impeded, this, would, for, example, allow, police, to, establish, a, restaurant, guest, s, identity, and, forward, it, to, the, innkeeper, in, a, case, where, the, guest, cannot, pay, the, bill, at, nighttime, because, his, wallet, had, just, been, stolen, from, the, restaurant, table, in, addition, there, are, federal, law, enforcement, agencies, in, the, united, states, whose, mission, includes, providing, protection, for, executives, such, as, the, president, and, accompanying, family, members, visiting, foreign, dignitaries, and, other, high, ranking, individuals, such, agencies, include, the, u, s, secret, service, and, the, u, s, park, police
