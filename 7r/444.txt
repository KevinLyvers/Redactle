quickly, spread, to, mesopotamia, the, southern, levant, southeastern, anatolia, eastern, arabia, and, the, sinai, peninsula, where, it, has, been, continually, written, and, spoken, in, different, varieties, for, over, three, thousand, years, aramaic, served, as, a, language, of, public, life, and, administration, of, ancient, kingdoms, and, empires, and, also, as, a, language, of, divine,

adaptation, of, specific, writing, systems, in, some, other, semitic, languages, of, west, asia, such, as, the, hebrew, alphabet, and, the, arabic, alphabet, the, aramaic, languages, are, now, considered, endangered, with, several, varieties, used, mainly, by, the, older, generations, researchers, are, working, to, record, and, analyze, all, of, the, remaining, varieties, of, neo, aramaic, languages, before, or, in, case, they, become, extinct, aramaic, dialects, today, form, the, mother, tongues, of, the, arameans, syriacs, in, the, qalamoun, mountains, assyrians, and, mandaeans, as,

linguistic, history, of, aramaic, prior, to, the, appearance, of, the, first, textual, sources, in, the, ninth, century, bc, remains, unknown, aramaic, is, also, believed, by, most, historians, and, scholars, to, have, been, the, primary, language, spoken, by, jesus, of, nazareth, both, for, preaching, and, in, everyday, life, historically, and, originally, aramaic, was, the, language, of, the, arameans, a, semitic, speaking, people, of, the, region, between, the, northern, levant, and, the, northern, tigris, valley, by, around, 1000, bc, the, arameans, had, a, string, of, kingdoms, in, what, is, now, part, of, syria, lebanon, jordan, turkey, and, the, fringes, of, southern, mesopotamia, iraq, aramaic, rose, to, prominence, under, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 605, bc, under, whose, influence, aramaic, became, a, prestige, language, after, being, adopted, as, a, lingua, franca, of, the, empire, by, assyrian, kings, and, its, use, was, spread, throughout, mesopotamia, the, levant, and, parts, of, asia, minor, arabian, peninsula, and, ancient, iran, under, assyrian, rule, at, its, height, aramaic, was, spoken, in, what, is, now, iraq, syria, lebanon, israel, jordan, kuwait, parts, of, southeast, and, south, central, turkey, northern, parts, of, the, arabian, peninsula, and, parts, of, northwest, iran, as, well, as, the, southern, caucasus, having, gradually, replaced, several, other, related, semitic, languages, according, to, the, babylonian, talmud, sanhedrin, 38b, the, language, spoken, by, adam, the, bible, s, first, human, was, aramaic, aramaic, was, the, language, of, jesus, who, spoke, the, galilean, dialect, during, his, public, ministry, as, well, as, the, language, of, several, sections, of, the, hebrew, bible, including, parts, of, the, books, of, daniel, and, ezra, and, also, the, language, of, the, targum, the, aramaic, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, it, is, also, the, language, of, the, jerusalem, talmud, babylonian, talmud, and, zohar, the, scribes, of, the, neo, assyrian, bureaucracy, also, used, aramaic, and, this, practice, was, subsequently, inherited, by, the, succeeding, neo, babylonian, empire, 605, 539, bc, and, later, by, the, achaemenid, empire, 539, 330, bc, mediated, by, scribes, that, had, been, trained, in, the, language, highly, standardized, written, aramaic, named, by, scholars, imperial, aramaic, progressively, also, became, the, lingua, franca, of, public, life, trade, and, commerce, throughout, achaemenid, territories, wide, use, of, written, aramaic, subsequently, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, aramaic, alphabet, and, as, logograms, some, aramaic, vocabulary, in, the, pahlavi, scripts, which, were, used, by, several, middle, iranian, languages, including, parthian, middle, persian, sogdian, and, khwarezmian, some, variants, of, aramaic, are, also, retained, as, sacred, languages, by, certain, religious, communities, most, notable, among, them, is, classical, syriac, the, liturgical, language, of, syriac, christianity, it, is, used, by, several, communities, including, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, the, ancient, church, of, the, east, the, chaldean, catholic, church, the, syriac, orthodox, church, the, syriac, catholic, church, the, maronite, church, and, also, the, saint, thomas, christians, syriac, christians, of, kerala, india, one, of, the, liturgical, dialects, was, mandaic, which, besides, becoming, a, vernacular, neo, mandaic, also, remained, the, liturgical, language, of, mandaeism, syriac, was, also, the, liturgical, language, of, several, now, extinct, gnostic, faiths, such, as, manichaeism, neo, aramaic, languages, are, still, spoken, in, the, 21st, century, as, a, first, language, by, many, communities, of, assyrians, mizrahi, jews, in, particular, the, jews, of, kurdistan, iraqi, jews, and, mandaeans, of, the, near, east, with, the, main, neo, aramaic, languages, being, suret, 240, 000, speakers, and, turoyo, 250, 000, speakers, western, neo, aramaic, 3, 000, persists, in, only, two, villages, in, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, in, western, syria, they, have, retained, use, of, the, once, dominant, lingua, franca, despite, subsequent, language, shifts, experienced, throughout, the, middle, east, the, connection, between, chaldean, syriac, and, samaritan, as, aramaic, was, first, identified, in, 1679, by, german, theologian, johann, wilhelm, hilliger, in, 1819, 21, ulrich, friedrich, kopp, published, his, bilder, und, schriften, der, vorzeit, images, and, inscriptions, of, the, past, in, which, he, established, the, basis, of, the, paleographical, development, of, the, northwest, semitic, scripts, kopp, criticised, jean, jacques, barth, lemy, and, other, scholars, who, had, characterized, all, the, then, known, inscriptions, and, coins, as, phoenician, with, everything, left, to, the, phoenicians, and, nothing, to, the, arameans, as, if, they, could, not, have, written, at, all, kopp, noted, that, some, of, the, words, on, the, carpentras, stele, corresponded, to, the, aramaic, in, the, book, of, daniel, and, in, the, book, of, ruth, josephus, and, strabo, the, latter, citing, posidonius, both, stated, that, the, syrians, called, themselves, arameans, the, septuagint, the, earliest, extant, full, copy, of, the, hebrew, bible, a, greek, translation, used, the, terms, syria, and, syrian, where, the, masoretic, text, the, earliest, extant, hebrew, copy, of, the, bible, uses, the, terms, aramean, and, aramaic, numerous, later, bibles, followed, the, septuagint, s, usage, including, the, king, james, version, this, connection, between, the, names, syrian, and, aramaic, was, discussed, in, 1835, by, tienne, marc, quatrem, re, in, historical, sources, aramaic, language, is, designated, by, two, distinctive, groups, of, terms, first, of, them, represented, by, endonymic, native, names, and, the, other, one, represented, by, various, exonymic, foreign, in, origin, names, native, endonymic, terms, for, aramaic, language, were, derived, from, the, same, word, root, as, the, name, of, its, original, speakers, the, ancient, arameans, endonymic, forms, were, also, adopted, in, some, other, languages, like, ancient, hebrew, in, the, torah, hebrew, bible, aram, is, used, as, a, proper, name, of, several, people, including, descendants, of, shem, nahor, and, jacob, ancient, aram, bordering, northern, israel, and, what, is, now, called, syria, is, considered, the, linguistic, center, of, aramaic, the, language, of, the, arameans, who, settled, the, area, during, the, bronze, age, c, 3500, bc, the, language, is, often, mistakenly, considered, to, have, originated, within, assyria, iraq, in, fact, arameans, carried, their, language, and, writing, into, mesopotamia, by, voluntary, migration, by, forced, exile, of, conquering, armies, and, by, nomadic, chaldean, invasions, of, babylonia, during, the, period, from, 1200, to, 1000, bc, unlike, in, hebrew, designations, for, aramaic, language, in, some, other, ancient, languages, were, mostly, exonymic, in, ancient, greek, aramaic, language, was, most, commonly, known, as, the, syrian, language, in, relation, to, the, native, non, greek, inhabitants, of, the, historical, region, of, syria, since, the, name, of, syria, itself, emerged, as, a, variant, of, assyria, the, biblical, ashur, and, akkadian, ashuru, a, complex, set, of, semantic, phenomena, was, created, becoming, a, subject, of, interest, both, among, ancient, writers, and, modern, scholars, the, koine, greek, word, hebra, st, has, been, translated, as, aramaic, in, some, versions, of, the, christian, new, testament, as, aramaic, was, at, that, time, the, language, commonly, spoken, by, the, jews, however, is, consistently, used, in, koine, greek, at, this, time, to, mean, hebrew, and, syristi, is, used, to, mean, aramaic, in, biblical, scholarship, the, term, chaldean, was, for, many, years, used, as, a, synonym, of, aramaic, due, to, its, use, in, the, book, of, daniel, and, subsequent, interpretation, by, jerome, during, the, neo, assyrian, and, neo, babylonian, empires, arameans, the, native, speakers, of, aramaic, began, to, settle, in, greater, numbers, in, babylonia, and, later, in, the, heartland, of, assyria, also, known, as, the, arbela, triangle, assur, nineveh, and, arbela, the, influx, eventually, resulted, in, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 605, bc, adopting, an, akkadian, influenced, imperial, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, its, empire, this, policy, was, continued, by, the, short, lived, neo, babylonian, empire, and, the, medes, and, all, three, empires, became, operationally, bilingual, in, written, sources, with, aramaic, used, alongside, akkadian, the, achaemenid, empire, 539, 323, bc, continued, this, tradition, and, the, extensive, influence, of, these, empires, led, to, aramaic, gradually, becoming, the, lingua, franca, of, most, of, western, asia, anatolia, the, caucasus, and, egypt, beginning, with, the, rise, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, and, the, early, muslim, conquests, in, the, late, seventh, century, arabic, gradually, replaced, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, near, east, however, aramaic, remains, a, spoken, literary, and, liturgical, language, for, local, christians, and, also, some, jews, aramaic, also, continues, to, be, spoken, by, the, assyrians, of, northern, iraq, northeastern, syria, southeastern, turkey, and, northwest, iran, with, diaspora, communities, in, armenia, georgia, azerbaijan, and, southern, russia, the, mandaeans, also, continue, to, use, classical, mandaic, as, a, liturgical, language, although, most, now, speak, arabic, as, their, first, language, there, are, still, also, a, small, number, of, first, language, speakers, of, western, aramaic, varieties, in, isolated, villages, in, western, syria, being, in, contact, with, other, regional, languages, some, neo, aramaic, dialects, were, often, engaged, in, the, mutual, exchange, of, influences, particularly, with, arabic, iranian, and, kurdish, the, turbulence, of, the, last, two, centuries, particularly, the, assyrian, genocide, also, known, as, seyfo, sword, in, syriac, has, seen, speakers, of, first, language, and, literary, aramaic, dispersed, throughout, the, world, however, there, are, several, sizable, assyrian, towns, in, northern, iraq, such, as, alqosh, bakhdida, bartella, tesqopa, and, tel, keppe, and, numerous, small, villages, where, aramaic, is, still, the, main, spoken, language, and, many, large, cities, in, this, region, also, have, suret, speaking, communities, particularly, mosul, erbil, kirkuk, dohuk, and, al, hasakah, in, modern, israel, the, only, native, aramaic, speaking, population, are, the, jews, of, kurdistan, although, the, language, is, dying, out, however, aramaic, is, also, experiencing, a, revival, among, maronites, in, israel, in, jish, aramaic, is, often, spoken, of, as, a, single, language, but, is, actually, a, group, of, related, languages, some, languages, differ, more, from, each, other, than, the, romance, languages, do, among, themselves, its, long, history, extensive, literature, and, use, by, different, religious, communities, are, all, factors, in, the, diversification, of, the, language, some, aramaic, dialects, are, mutually, intelligible, whereas, others, are, not, similar, to, the, situation, with, modern, varieties, of, arabic, some, aramaic, languages, are, known, under, different, names, for, example, syriac, is, particularly, used, to, describe, the, eastern, aramaic, variety, spoken, by, syriac, christian, communities, in, northern, iraq, southeastern, turkey, northeastern, syria, and, northwestern, iran, and, the, saint, thomas, christians, in, kerala, india, most, dialects, can, be, described, as, either, eastern, or, western, the, dividing, line, being, roughly, the, euphrates, or, slightly, west, of, it, it, is, also, helpful, to, distinguish, modern, living, languages, or, neo, aramaics, and, those, that, are, still, in, use, as, literary, or, liturgical, languages, or, are, only, of, interest, to, scholars, although, there, are, some, exceptions, to, this, rule, this, classification, gives, old, middle, and, modern, periods, alongside, eastern, and, western, areas, to, distinguish, between, the, various, languages, and, dialects, that, are, aramaic, the, earliest, aramaic, alphabet, was, based, on, the, phoenician, alphabet, in, time, aramaic, developed, its, distinctive, square, style, the, ancient, israelites, and, other, peoples, of, canaan, adopted, this, alphabet, for, writing, their, own, languages, thus, it, is, better, known, as, the, hebrew, alphabet, this, is, the, writing, system, used, in, biblical, aramaic, and, other, jewish, writing, in, aramaic, the, other, main, writing, system, used, for, aramaic, was, developed, by, christian, communities, a, cursive, form, known, as, the, syriac, alphabet, a, highly, modified, form, of, the, aramaic, alphabet, the, mandaic, alphabet, is, used, by, the, mandaeans, in, addition, to, these, writing, systems, certain, derivatives, of, the, aramaic, alphabet, were, used, in, ancient, times, by, particular, groups, the, nabataean, alphabet, in, petra, and, the, palmyrene, alphabet, in, palmyra, in, modern, times, turoyo, see, below, has, sometimes, been, written, in, a, latin, script, periodization, of, historical, development, of, aramaic, language, has, been, the, subject, of, particular, interest, for, scholars, who, proposed, several, types, of, periodization, based, on, linguistic, chronological, and, territorial, criteria, overlapping, terminology, used, in, different, periodizations, led, to, the, creation, of, several, polysemic, terms, that, are, used, differently, among, scholars, terms, like, old, aramaic, ancient, aramaic, early, aramaic, middle, aramaic, late, aramaic, and, some, others, like, paleo, aramaic, were, used, in, various, meanings, thus, referring, in, scope, or, substance, to, different, stages, in, historical, development, of, aramaic, language, most, commonly, used, types, of, periodization, are, those, of, klaus, beyer, and, joseph, fitzmyer, periodization, of, klaus, beyer, 1929, 2014, periodization, of, joseph, fitzmyer, 1920, 2016, recent, periodization, of, aaron, butts, aramaic, s, long, history, and, diverse, and, widespread, use, has, led, to, the, development, of, many, divergent, varieties, which, are, sometimes, considered, dialects, though, they, have, become, distinct, enough, over, time, that, they, are, now, sometimes, considered, separate, languages, therefore, there, is, not, one, singular, static, aramaic, language, each, time, and, place, rather, has, had, its, own, variation, the, more, widely, spoken, eastern, aramaic, languages, are, largely, restricted, to, assyrian, mandean, and, mizrahi, jewish, communities, in, iraq, northeastern, syria, northwestern, iran, and, southeastern, turkey, whilst, the, severely, endangered, western, neo, aramaic, language, is, spoken, by, small, christian, and, muslim, communities, in, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, and, closely, related, western, varieties, of, aramaic, persisted, in, mount, lebanon, until, as, late, as, the, 17th, century, the, term, old, aramaic, is, used, to, describe, the, varieties, of, the, language, from, its, first, known, use, until, the, point, roughly, marked, by, the, rise, of, the, sasanian, empire, 224, ad, dominating, the, influential, eastern, dialect, region, as, such, the, term, covers, over, thirteen, centuries, of, the, development, of, aramaic, this, vast, time, span, includes, all, aramaic, that, is, now, effectively, extinct, regarding, the, earliest, forms, beyer, suggests, that, written, aramaic, probably, dates, from, the, 11th, century, bce, as, it, is, established, by, the, 10th, century, to, which, he, dates, the, oldest, inscriptions, of, northern, syria, heinrichs, uses, the, less, controversial, date, of, the, 9th, century, for, which, there, is, clear, and, widespread, attestation, the, central, phase, in, the, development, of, old, aramaic, was, its, official, use, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 608, bc, neo, babylonian, empire, 620, 539, bc, and, achaemenid, empire, 500, 330, bc, the, period, before, this, dubbed, ancient, aramaic, saw, the, development, of, the, language, from, being, spoken, in, aramaean, city, states, to, become, a, major, means, of, communication, in, diplomacy, and, trade, throughout, mesopotamia, the, levant, and, egypt, after, the, fall, of, the, achaemenid, empire, local, vernaculars, became, increasingly, prominent, fanning, the, divergence, of, an, aramaic, dialect, continuum, and, the, development, of, differing, written, standards, ancient, aramaic, refers, to, the, earliest, known, period, of, the, language, from, its, origin, until, it, becomes, the, lingua, franca, of, the, fertile, crescent, it, was, the, language, of, the, aramean, city, states, of, damascus, hamath, and, arpad, there, are, inscriptions, that, evidence, the, earliest, use, of, the, language, dating, from, the, 10th, century, bc, these, inscriptions, are, mostly, diplomatic, documents, between, aramaean, city, states, the, alphabet, of, aramaic, at, this, early, period, seems, to, be, based, on, the, phoenician, alphabet, and, there, is, a, unity, in, the, written, language, it, seems, that, in, time, a, more, refined, alphabet, suited, to, the, needs, of, the, language, began, to, develop, from, this, in, the, eastern, regions, of, aram, due, to, increasing, aramean, migration, eastward, the, western, periphery, of, assyria, became, bilingual, in, akkadian, and, aramean, at, least, as, early, as, the, mid, 9th, century, bc, as, the, neo, assyrian, empire, conquered, aramean, lands, west, of, the, euphrates, tiglath, pileser, iii, made, aramaic, the, empire, s, second, official, language, and, it, eventually, supplanted, akkadian, completely, from, 700, bc, the, language, began, to, spread, in, all, directions, but, lost, much, of, its, unity, different, dialects, emerged, in, assyria, babylonia, the, levant, and, egypt, around, 600, bc, adon, a, canaanite, king, used, aramaic, to, write, to, an, egyptian, pharaoh, around, 500, bc, following, the, achaemenid, persian, conquest, of, mesopotamia, under, darius, i, aramaic, as, had, been, used, in, that, region, was, adopted, by, the, conquerors, as, the, vehicle, for, written, communication, between, the, different, regions, of, the, vast, empire, with, its, different, peoples, and, languages, the, use, of, a, single, official, language, which, modern, scholarship, has, dubbed, official, aramaic, or, imperial, aramaic, can, be, assumed, to, have, greatly, contributed, to, the, astonishing, success, of, the, achaemenids, in, holding, their, far, flung, empire, together, for, as, long, as, they, did, in, 1955, richard, frye, questioned, the, classification, of, imperial, aramaic, as, an, official, language, noting, that, no, surviving, edict, expressly, and, unambiguously, accorded, that, status, to, any, particular, language, frye, reclassifies, imperial, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, achaemenid, territories, suggesting, then, that, the, achaemenid, era, use, of, aramaic, was, more, pervasive, than, generally, thought, imperial, aramaic, was, highly, standardised, its, orthography, was, based, more, on, historical, roots, than, any, spoken, dialect, and, the, inevitable, influence, of, persian, gave, the, language, a, new, clarity, and, robust, flexibility, for, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, achaemenid, empire, in, 330, bc, imperial, aramaic, or, a, version, thereof, near, enough, for, it, to, be, recognisable, would, remain, an, influence, on, the, various, native, iranian, languages, aramaic, script, and, as, ideograms, aramaic, vocabulary, would, survive, as, the, essential, characteristics, of, the, pahlavi, scripts, one, of, the, largest, collections, of, imperial, aramaic, texts, is, that, of, the, persepolis, administrative, archives, found, at, persepolis, which, number, about, five, hundred, many, of, the, extant, documents, witnessing, to, this, form, of, aramaic, come, from, egypt, and, elephantine, in, particular, see, elephantine, papyri, of, them, the, best, known, is, the, story, of, ahikar, a, book, of, instructive, aphorisms, quite, similar, in, style, to, the, biblical, book, of, proverbs, consensus, as, of, 2022, regards, the, aramaic, portion, of, the, biblical, book, of, daniel, i, e, 2, 4b, 7, 28, as, an, example, of, imperial, official, aramaic, achaemenid, aramaic, is, sufficiently, uniform, that, it, is, often, difficult, to, know, where, any, particular, example, of, the, language, was, written, only, careful, examination, reveals, the, occasional, loan, word, from, a, local, language, a, group, of, thirty, aramaic, documents, from, bactria, have, been, discovered, and, an, analysis, was, published, in, november, 2006, the, texts, which, were, rendered, on, leather, reflect, the, use, of, aramaic, in, the, 4th, century, bc, achaemenid, administration, of, bactria, and, sogdia, biblical, aramaic, is, the, aramaic, found, in, four, discrete, sections, of, the, bible, biblical, aramaic, is, a, somewhat, hybrid, dialect, it, is, theorized, that, some, biblical, aramaic, material, originated, in, both, babylonia, and, judaea, before, the, fall, of, the, achaemenid, dynasty, biblical, aramaic, presented, various, challenges, for, writers, who, were, engaged, in, early, biblical, studies, since, the, time, of, jerome, of, stridon, d, 420, aramaic, of, the, bible, was, named, as, chaldean, chaldaic, chaldee, that, label, remained, common, in, early, aramaic, studies, and, persisted, up, into, the, nineteenth, century, the, chaldean, misnomer, was, eventually, abandoned, when, modern, scholarly, analyses, showed, that, aramaic, dialect, used, in, hebrew, bible, was, not, related, to, ancient, chaldeans, and, their, language, the, fall, of, the, achaemenid, empire, c, 334, 330, bc, and, its, replacement, with, the, newly, created, political, order, imposed, by, alexander, the, great, d, 323, bc, and, his, hellenistic, successors, marked, an, important, turning, point, in, the, history, of, aramaic, language, during, the, early, stages, of, the, post, achaemenid, era, public, use, of, aramaic, language, was, continued, but, shared, with, the, newly, introduced, greek, language, by, the, year, 300, bc, all, of, the, main, aramaic, speaking, regions, came, under, political, rule, of, the, newly, created, seleucid, empire, that, promoted, hellenistic, culture, and, favored, greek, language, as, the, main, language, of, public, life, and, administration, during, the, 3rd, century, bce, greek, overtook, aramaic, in, many, spheres, of, public, communication, particularly, in, highly, hellenized, cities, throughout, the, seleucid, domains, however, aramaic, continued, to, be, used, in, its, post, achaemenid, form, among, upper, and, literate, classes, of, native, aramaic, speaking, communities, and, also, by, local, authorities, along, with, the, newly, introduced, greek, post, achaemenid, aramaic, that, bears, a, relatively, close, resemblance, to, that, of, the, achaemenid, period, continued, to, be, used, up, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, by, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, several, variants, of, post, achaemenid, aramaic, emerged, bearing, regional, characteristics, one, of, them, was, hasmonaean, aramaic, the, official, administrative, language, of, hasmonaean, judaea, 142, 37, bc, alongside, hebrew, which, was, the, language, preferred, in, religious, and, some, other, public, uses, coinage, it, influenced, the, biblical, aramaic, of, the, qumran, texts, and, was, the, main, language, of, non, biblical, theological, texts, of, that, community, the, major, targums, translations, of, the, hebrew, bible, into, aramaic, were, originally, composed, in, hasmonaean, aramaic, it, also, appears, in, quotations, in, the, mishnah, and, tosefta, although, smoothed, into, its, later, context, it, is, written, quite, differently, from, achaemenid, aramaic, there, is, an, emphasis, on, writing, as, words, are, pronounced, rather, than, using, etymological, forms, the, use, of, written, aramaic, in, the, achaemenid, bureaucracy, also, precipitated, the, adoption, of, aramaic, derived, scripts, to, render, a, number, of, middle, iranian, languages, moreover, many, common, words, including, even, pronouns, particles, numerals, and, auxiliaries, continued, to, be, written, as, aramaic, words, even, when, writing, middle, iranian, languages, in, time, in, iranian, usage, these, aramaic, words, became, disassociated, from, the, aramaic, language, and, came, to, be, understood, as, signs, i, e, logograms, much, like, the, symbol, is, read, as, and, in, english, and, the, original, latin, et, is, now, no, longer, obvious, under, the, early, 3rd, century, bc, parthian, arsacids, whose, government, used, greek, but, whose, native, language, was, parthian, the, parthian, language, and, its, aramaic, derived, writing, system, both, gained, prestige, this, in, turn, also, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, name, pahlavi, parthawi, of, the, parthians, for, that, writing, system, the, persian, sassanids, who, succeeded, the, parthian, arsacids, in, the, mid, 3rd, century, ad, subsequently, inherited, adopted, the, parthian, mediated, aramaic, derived, writing, system, for, their, own, middle, iranian, ethnolect, as, well, that, particular, middle, iranian, dialect, middle, persian, i, e, the, language, of, persia, proper, subsequently, also, became, a, prestige, language, following, the, conquest, of, the, sassanids, by, the, arabs, in, the, 7th, century, the, aramaic, derived, writing, system, was, replaced, by, the, arabic, alphabet, in, all, but, zoroastrian, usage, which, continued, to, use, the, name, pahlavi, for, the, aramaic, derived, writing, system, and, went, on, to, create, the, bulk, of, all, middle, iranian, literature, in, that, writing, system, other, regional, dialects, continued, to, exist, alongside, these, often, as, simple, spoken, variants, of, aramaic, early, evidence, for, these, vernacular, dialects, is, known, only, through, their, influence, on, words, and, names, in, a, more, standard, dialect, however, some, of, those, regional, dialects, became, written, languages, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, these, dialects, reflect, a, stream, of, aramaic, that, is, not, directly, dependent, on, achaemenid, aramaic, and, they, also, show, a, clear, linguistic, diversity, between, eastern, and, western, regions, babylonian, targumic, is, the, later, post, achaemenid, dialect, found, in, the, targum, onqelos, and, targum, jonathan, the, official, targums, the, original, hasmonaean, targums, had, reached, babylon, sometime, in, the, 2nd, or, 3rd, century, ad, they, were, then, reworked, according, to, the, contemporary, dialect, of, babylon, to, create, the, language, of, the, standard, targums, this, combination, formed, the, basis, of, babylonian, jewish, literature, for, centuries, to, follow, galilean, targumic, is, similar, to, babylonian, targumic, it, is, the, mixing, of, literary, hasmonaean, with, the, dialect, of, galilee, the, hasmonaean, targums, reached, galilee, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, were, reworked, into, this, galilean, dialect, for, local, use, the, galilean, targum, was, not, considered, an, authoritative, work, by, other, communities, and, documentary, evidence, shows, that, its, text, was, amended, from, the, 11th, century, ad, onwards, once, the, babylonian, targum, had, become, normative, the, galilean, version, became, heavily, influenced, by, it, babylonian, documentary, aramaic, is, a, dialect, in, use, from, the, 3rd, century, ad, onwards, it, is, the, dialect, of, babylonian, private, documents, and, from, the, 12th, century, all, jewish, private, documents, are, in, aramaic, it, is, based, on, hasmonaean, with, very, few, changes, this, was, perhaps, because, many, of, the, documents, in, bda, are, legal, documents, the, language, in, them, had, to, be, sensible, throughout, the, jewish, community, from, the, start, and, hasmonaean, was, the, old, standard, nabataean, aramaic, was, the, written, language, of, the, arab, kingdom, of, nabataea, whose, capital, was, petra, the, kingdom, c, 200, bc, 106, ad, controlled, the, region, to, the, east, of, the, jordan, river, the, negev, the, sinai, peninsula, and, the, northern, hijaz, and, supported, a, wide, ranging, trade, network, the, nabataeans, used, imperial, aramaic, for, written, communications, rather, than, their, native, arabic, nabataean, aramaic, developed, from, imperial, aramaic, with, some, influence, from, arabic, l, is, often, turned, into, n, and, there, are, some, arabic, loanwords, arabic, influence, on, nabataean, aramaic, increased, over, time, some, nabataean, aramaic, inscriptions, date, from, the, early, days, of, the, kingdom, but, most, datable, inscriptions, are, from, the, first, four, centuries, ad, the, language, is, written, in, a, cursive, script, that, was, the, precursor, to, the, arabic, alphabet, after, annexation, by, the, romans, in, 106, ad, most, of, nabataea, was, subsumed, into, the, province, of, arabia, petraea, the, nabataeans, turned, to, greek, for, written, communications, and, the, use, of, aramaic, declined, palmyrene, aramaic, is, the, dialect, that, was, in, use, in, the, multicultural, city, state, of, palmyra, in, the, syrian, desert, from, 44, bc, to, 274, ad, it, was, written, in, a, rounded, script, which, later, gave, way, to, cursive, estrangela, like, nabataean, palmyrene, was, influenced, by, arabic, but, to, a, much, lesser, degree, in, the, eastern, regions, from, mesopotamia, to, persia, dialects, like, palmyrene, aramaic, and, arsacid, aramaic, gradually, merged, with, the, regional, vernacular, dialects, thus, creating, languages, with, a, foot, in, achaemenid, and, a, foot, in, regional, aramaic, in, the, kingdom, of, osroene, founded, in, 132, bce, and, centred, in, edessa, urhay, the, regional, dialect, became, the, official, language, edessan, aramaic, urhaya, that, later, came, to, be, known, as, classical, syriac, on, the, upper, reaches, of, the, tigris, east, mesopotamian, aramaic, flourished, with, evidence, from, the, regions, of, hatra, and, assur, tatian, the, assyrian, or, syrian, the, author, of, the, gospel, harmony, the, diatessaron, came, from, adiabene, syr, beth, hadiab, and, perhaps, wrote, his, work, 172, ad, in, east, mesopotamian, rather, than, classical, syriac, or, greek, in, babylonia, the, regional, dialect, was, used, by, the, jewish, community, jewish, old, babylonian, from, c, 70, ad, this, everyday, language, increasingly, came, under, the, influence, of, biblical, aramaic, and, babylonian, targumic, the, written, form, of, mandaic, the, language, of, mandaeism, was, descended, from, the, arsacid, chancery, script, the, western, regional, dialects, of, aramaic, followed, a, similar, course, to, those, of, the, east, they, are, quite, distinct, from, the, eastern, dialects, and, imperial, aramaic, aramaic, came, to, coexist, with, canaanite, dialects, eventually, completely, displacing, phoenician, in, the, first, century, bc, and, hebrew, around, the, turn, of, the, fourth, century, ad, the, form, of, late, old, western, aramaic, used, by, the, jewish, community, is, best, attested, and, is, usually, referred, to, as, jewish, old, palestinian, its, oldest, form, is, old, east, jordanian, which, probably, comes, from, the, region, of, caesarea, philippi, this, is, the, dialect, of, the, oldest, manuscript, of, the, book, of, enoch, c, 170, bc, the, next, distinct, phase, of, the, language, is, called, old, judaean, lasting, into, the, second, century, ad, old, judean, literature, can, be, found, in, various, inscriptions, and, personal, letters, preserved, quotations, in, the, talmud, and, receipts, from, qumran, josephus, first, non, extant, edition, of, his, the, jewish, war, was, written, in, old, judean, the, old, east, jordanian, dialect, continued, to, be, used, into, the, first, century, ad, by, pagan, communities, living, to, the, east, of, the, jordan, their, dialect, is, often, then, called, pagan, old, palestinian, and, it, was, written, in, a, cursive, script, somewhat, similar, to, that, used, for, old, syriac, a, christian, old, palestinian, dialect, may, have, arisen, from, the, pagan, one, and, this, dialect, may, be, behind, some, of, the, western, aramaic, tendencies, found, in, the, otherwise, eastern, old, syriac, gospels, see, peshitta, it, is, generally, believed, by, christian, scholars, that, in, the, first, century, jews, in, judea, primarily, spoke, aramaic, with, a, decreasing, number, using, hebrew, as, their, first, language, though, many, learned, hebrew, as, a, liturgical, language, additionally, koine, greek, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, near, east, in, trade, among, the, hellenized, classes, much, like, french, in, the, 18th, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, in, europe, and, in, the, roman, administration, latin, the, language, of, the, roman, army, and, higher, levels, of, administration, had, almost, no, impact, on, the, linguistic, landscape, in, addition, to, the, formal, literary, dialects, of, aramaic, based, on, hasmonean, and, babylonian, there, were, a, number, of, colloquial, aramaic, dialects, seven, western, aramaic, varieties, were, spoken, in, the, vicinity, of, judea, in, jesus, time, they, were, probably, distinctive, yet, mutually, intelligible, old, judean, was, the, prominent, dialect, of, jerusalem, and, judaea, the, region, of, ein, gedi, spoke, the, southeast, judaean, dialect, samaria, had, its, distinctive, samaritan, aramaic, where, the, consonants, he, heth, and, ayin, all, became, pronounced, as, aleph, galilean, aramaic, the, dialect, of, jesus, home, region, is, only, known, from, a, few, place, names, the, influences, on, galilean, targumic, some, rabbinic, literature, and, a, few, private, letters, it, seems, to, have, a, number, of, distinctive, features, diphthongs, are, never, simplified, into, monophthongs, east, of, the, jordan, the, various, dialects, of, east, jordanian, were, spoken, in, the, region, of, damascus, and, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, damascene, aramaic, was, spoken, deduced, mostly, from, modern, western, aramaic, finally, as, far, north, as, aleppo, the, western, dialect, of, orontes, aramaic, was, spoken, the, three, languages, especially, hebrew, and, aramaic, influenced, one, another, through, loanwords, and, semantic, loans, hebrew, words, entered, jewish, aramaic, most, were, mostly, technical, religious, words, but, a, few, were, everyday, words, like, wood, conversely, aramaic, words, such, as, m, mm, n, wealth, were, borrowed, into, hebrew, and, hebrew, words, acquired, additional, senses, from, aramaic, for, instance, hebrew, r, i, seen, borrowed, the, sense, worthy, seemly, from, the, aramaic, z, meaning, seen, and, worthy, the, greek, of, the, new, testament, preserves, some, semiticisms, including, transliterations, of, semitic, words, some, are, aramaic, like, talitha, which, represents, the, noun, al, and, others, may, be, either, hebrew, or, aramaic, like, rabbounei, which, means, my, master, great, one, teacher, in, both, languages, other, examples, the, 2004, film, the, passion, of, the, christ, used, aramaic, for, much, of, its, dialogue, specially, reconstructed, by, a, scholar, william, fulco, s, j, where, the, appropriate, words, in, first, century, aramaic, were, no, longer, known, he, used, the, aramaic, of, daniel, and, fourth, century, syriac, and, hebrew, as, the, basis, for, his, work, during, the, late, middle, aramaic, period, spanning, from, 300, b, c, e, to, 200, c, e, aramaic, diverged, into, its, eastern, and, western, branches, during, this, time, the, nature, of, various, aramaic, dialects, began, to, change, the, descendants, of, imperial, aramaic, ceased, to, be, living, languages, and, the, eastern, and, western, regional, dialects, started, to, develop, significant, new, literatures, unlike, many, dialects, of, old, aramaic, much, is, known, about, the, vocabulary, and, grammar, of, middle, aramaic, the, dialects, of, old, eastern, aramaic, continued, in, ancient, assyria, babylon, and, the, achaemenid, empire, as, written, languages, using, various, aramaic, scripts, eastern, middle, aramaic, comprises, classical, mandaic, hatran, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, dialects, and, classical, syriac, syriac, aramaic, also, classical, syriac, is, the, literary, liturgical, and, often, spoken, language, of, syriac, christianity, it, originated, by, the, first, century, ad, in, the, region, of, osroene, centered, in, edessa, but, its, golden, age, was, the, fourth, to, eight, centuries, this, period, began, with, the, translation, of, the, bible, into, the, language, the, peshitta, and, the, masterful, prose, and, poetry, of, ephrem, the, syrian, classical, syriac, became, the, language, of, the, assyrian, church, of, the, east, and, the, syriac, orthodox, church, and, later, the, nestorian, church, missionary, activity, led, to, the, spread, of, syriac, from, mesopotamia, and, persia, into, central, asia, india, and, china, jewish, middle, babylonian, is, the, language, employed, by, jewish, writers, in, babylonia, between, the, fourth, and, the, eleventh, century, it, is, most, commonly, identified, with, the, language, of, the, babylonian, talmud, which, was, completed, in, the, seventh, century, and, of, post, talmudic, geonic, literature, which, are, the, most, important, cultural, products, of, babylonian, judaism, the, most, important, epigraphic, sources, for, the, dialect, are, the, hundreds, of, incantation, bowls, written, in, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, classical, mandaic, used, as, a, liturgical, language, by, the, mandaeans, of, iraq, and, iran, is, a, sister, dialect, to, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, though, it, is, both, linguistically, and, culturally, distinct, it, is, the, language, in, which, the, mandaeans, gnostic, religious, literature, was, composed, it, is, characterized, by, a, highly, phonetic, orthography, and, does, not, make, use, of, vowel, diacritics, the, dialects, of, old, western, aramaic, continued, with, nabataean, jewish, palestinian, in, hebrew, square, script, samaritan, aramaic, in, the, old, hebrew, script, and, christian, palestinian, in, syriac, estrangela, script, of, these, four, only, jewish, palestinian, continued, as, a, written, language, the, samaritan, aramaic, is, earliest, attested, by, the, documentary, tradition, of, the, samaritans, that, can, be, dated, back, to, the, fourth, century, its, modern, pronunciation, is, based, on, the, form, used, in, the, tenth, century, in, 135, after, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, many, jewish, leaders, expelled, from, jerusalem, moved, to, galilee, the, galilean, dialect, thus, rose, from, obscurity, to, become, the, standard, among, jews, in, the, west, this, dialect, was, spoken, not, only, in, galilee, but, also, in, the, surrounding, parts, it, is, the, linguistic, setting, for, the, jerusalem, talmud, completed, in, the, 5th, century, palestinian, targumim, jewish, aramaic, versions, of, scripture, and, midrashim, biblical, commentaries, and, teaching, the, standard, vowel, pointing, for, the, hebrew, bible, the, tiberian, system, 7th, century, was, developed, by, speakers, of, the, galilean, dialect, of, jewish, middle, palestinian, classical, hebrew, vocalisation, therefore, in, representing, the, hebrew, of, this, period, probably, reflects, the, contemporary, pronunciation, of, this, aramaic, dialect, middle, judaean, aramaic, the, descendant, of, old, judaean, aramaic, was, no, longer, the, dominant, dialect, and, was, used, only, in, southern, judaea, the, variant, engedi, dialect, continued, throughout, this, period, likewise, middle, east, jordanian, aramaic, continued, as, a, minor, dialect, from, old, east, jordanian, aramaic, the, inscriptions, in, the, synagogue, at, dura, europos, are, either, in, middle, east, jordanian, or, middle, judaean, this, was, the, language, of, the, christian, melkite, chalcedonian, community, predominantly, of, jewish, descent, in, palestine, transjordan, and, sinai, from, the, 5th, to, the, 8th, century, as, a, liturgical, language, it, was, used, up, to, the, 13th, century, it, is, also, been, called, melkite, aramaic, syro, palestinian, and, palestinian, syriac, the, language, itself, comes, from, old, western, aramaic, but, its, writing, conventions, were, based, on, the, aramaic, dialect, of, edessa, and, it, was, heavily, influenced, by, greek, for, example, the, name, jesus, syriac, is, written, s, s, a, transliteration, of, the, greek, form, in, christian, palestinian, as, the, western, aramaic, dialects, of, the, levant, have, become, nearly, extinct, in, non, liturgical, usage, the, most, prolific, speakers, of, neo, aramaic, languages, in, the, 21st, century, are, eastern, aramaic, speakers, the, most, numerous, being, the, central, neo, aramaic, and, northeastern, neo, aramaic, nena, speakers, of, mesopotamia, this, includes, speakers, of, the, assyrian, 235, 000, speakers, and, chaldean, 216, 000, speakers, varieties, of, suret, and, turoyo, 112, 000, to, 450, 000, speakers, having, largely, lived, in, remote, areas, as, insulated, communities, for, over, a, millennium, the, remaining, speakers, of, modern, aramaic, dialects, such, as, the, arameans, of, the, qalamoun, mountains, assyrians, mandaeans, and, mizrahi, jews, escaped, the, linguistic, pressures, experienced, by, others, during, the, large, scale, language, shifts, that, saw, the, proliferation, of, other, tongues, among, those, who, previously, did, not, speak, them, most, recently, the, arabization, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, by, arabs, beginning, with, the, early, muslim, conquests, of, the, seventh, century, modern, eastern, aramaic, exists, in, a, wide, variety, of, dialects, and, languages, there, is, significant, difference, between, the, aramaic, spoken, by, assyrians, mizrahi, jews, and, mandaeans, with, mutually, unintelligible, variations, within, each, of, these, groups, the, christian, varieties, of, northeastern, neo, aramaic, nena, are, often, called, assyrian, chaldean, or, eastern, syriac, and, are, spoken, by, the, assyrians, in, northern, iraq, northeast, syria, southeast, turkey, northwest, iran, and, in, the, diaspora, however, they, also, have, roots, in, numerous, previously, unwritten, local, aramaic, varieties, and, in, some, cases, even, contain, akkadian, influences, these, varieties, are, not, purely, the, direct, descendants, of, the, language, of, ephrem, the, syrian, which, was, classical, syriac, the, judeo, aramaic, languages, are, now, mostly, spoken, in, israel, and, most, are, facing, extinction, the, jewish, varieties, that, have, come, from, communities, that, once, lived, between, lake, urmia, and, mosul, are, not, all, mutually, intelligible, in, some, places, for, example, urmia, christian, assyrians, and, mizrahi, jews, speak, mutually, unintelligible, varieties, of, northeastern, neo, aramaic, in, the, same, place, in, others, the, nineveh, plains, around, mosul, for, example, the, varieties, of, these, two, ethnicities, are, similar, enough, to, allow, conversation, modern, central, neo, aramaic, being, in, between, western, neo, aramaic, and, northeastern, neo, aramaic, is, generally, represented, by, turoyo, the, language, of, the, assyrians, syriacs, of, tur, abdin, a, related, neo, aramaic, language, mla, s, has, recently, become, extinct, mandaeans, living, in, the, khuzestan, province, of, iran, and, scattered, throughout, iraq, speak,

as, few, as, 5, 000, people, with, other, mandaeans, having, varying, degrees, of, knowledge, very, little, remains, of, western, aramaic, its, only, remaining, vernacular, is, western, neo, aramaic, which, is, still, spoken, in, the, aramean, villages, of, maaloula, and, jubb, adin, on, syria, s, side, of, the, anti, lebanon, mountains, as, well, as, by, some, people, who, migrated, from, these,

in, west, syriac, dialects, and, possibly, middle, galilean, the, long, a, became, the, o, sound, the, open, e, and, back, a, are, often, indicated, in, writing, by, the, use, of, the, letters, alaph, a, glottal, stop, or, he, like, the, english, h, the, close, front, vowel, is, the, long, i, like, the, vowel, in, need, it, has, a, slightly, more, open, counterpart, the, long, e, as, in, the, final, vowel, of, caf, both, of, these, have, shorter, counterparts, which, tend, to, be, pronounced, slightly, more, open, thus, the, short, close, e, corresponds, with, the, open, e, in, some, dialects, the, close, front, vowels, usually, use, the, consonant, y, as, a, mater, lectionis, the, close, back, vowel, is, the, long, u, like, the, vowel, in, school, it, has, a, more, open, counterpart, the, long, o, like, the, vowel, in, show, there, are, shorter, and, thus, more, open, counterparts, to, each, of, these, with, the, short, close, o, sometimes, corresponding, with, the, long, open, a, the, close, back, vowels, often, use, the, consonant, w, to, indicate, their, quality, two, basic, diphthongs, exist, an, open, vowel, followed, by, y, ay, and, an, open, vowel, followed, by, w, aw, these, were, originally, full, diphthongs, but, many, dialects, have, converted, them, to, e, and, o, respectively, the, so, called, emphatic, consonants, see, the, next, section, cause, all, vowels, to, become, mid, centralised, the, various, alphabets, used, for, writing, aramaic, languages, have, twenty, two, letters, all, of, which, are, consonants, some, of, these, letters, though, can, stand, for, two, or, three, different, sounds, usually, a, stop, and, a, fricative, at, the, same, point, of, articulation, aramaic, classically, uses, a, series, of, lightly, contrasted, plosives, and, fricatives, each, member, of, a, certain, pair, is, written, with, the, same, letter, of, the, alphabet, in, most, writing, systems, that, is, p, and, f, are, written, with, the, same, letter, and, are, near, allophones, a, distinguishing, feature, of, aramaic, phonology, and, that, of, semitic, languages, in, general, is, the, presence, of, emphatic, consonants, these, are, consonants, that, are, pronounced, with, the, root, of, the, tongue, retracted, with, varying, degrees, of, pharyngealization, and, velarization, using, their, alphabetic, names, these, emphatics, are, ancient, aramaic, may, have, had, a, larger, series, of, emphatics, and, some, neo, aramaic, languages, definitely, do, not, all, dialects, of, aramaic, give, these, consonants, their, historic, values, overlapping, with, the, set, of, emphatics, are, the, guttural, consonants, they, include, and, ayn, from, the, emphatic, set, and, add, lap, a, glottal, stop, and, h, as, the, english, h, aramaic, classically, has, a, set, of, four, sibilants, ancient, aramaic, may, have, had, six, in, addition, to, these, sets, aramaic, has, the, nasal, consonants, m, and, n, and, the, approximants, r, usually, an, alveolar, trill, l, y, and, w, six, broad, features, of, sound, change, can, be, seen, as, dialect, differentials, as, in, other, semitic, languages, aramaic, morphology, the, way, words, are, formed, is, based, on, the, consonantal, root, the, root, generally, consists, of, two, or, three, consonants, and, has, a, basic, meaning, for, example, k, t, b, has, the, meaning, of, writing, this, is, then, modified, by, the, addition, of, vowels, and, other, consonants, to, create, different, nuances, of, the, basic, meaning, aramaic, nouns, and, adjectives, are, inflected, to, show, gender, number, and, state, aramaic, has, two, grammatical, genders, masculine, and, feminine, the, feminine, absolute, singular, is, often, marked, by, the, ending, nouns, can, be, either, singular, or, plural, but, an, additional, dual, number, exists, for, nouns, that, usually, come, in, pairs, the, dual, number, gradually, disappeared, from, aramaic, over, time, and, has, little, influence, in, middle, and, modern, aramaic, aramaic, nouns, and, adjectives, can, exist, in, one, of, three, states, to, a, certain, extent, these, states, correspond, to, the, role, of, articles, and, cases, in, the, indo, european, languages, whereas, other, northwest, semitic, languages, like, hebrew, have, the, absolute, and, construct, states, the, emphatic, determined, state, is, a, unique, feature, to, aramaic, case, endings, as, in, ugaritic, probably, existed, in, a, very, early, stage, of, the, language, and, glimpses, of, them, can, be, seen, in, a, few, compound, proper, names, however, as, most, of, those, cases, were, expressed, by, short, final, vowels, they, were, never, written, and, the, few, characteristic, long, vowels, of, the, masculine, plural, accusative, and, genitive, are, not, clearly, evidenced, in, inscriptions, often, the, direct, object, is, marked, by, a, prefixed, l, the, preposition, to, if, it, is, definite, adjectives, agree, with, their, nouns, in, number, and, gender, but, agree, in, state, only, if, used, attributively, predicative, adjectives, are, in, the, absolute, state, regardless, of, the, state, of, their, noun, a, copula, may, or, may, not, be, written, thus, an, attributive, adjective, to, an, emphatic, noun, as, in, the, phrase, the, good, king, is, written, also, in, the, emphatic, state, malk, king, good, in, comparison, the, predicative, adjective, as, in, the, phrase, the, king, is, good, is, written, in, the, absolute, state, malk, king, good, the, final, in, a, number, of, these, suffixes, is, written, with, the, letter, aleph, however, some, jewish, aramaic, texts, employ, the, letter, he, for, the, feminine, absolute, singular, likewise, some, jewish, aramaic, texts, employ, the, hebrew, masculine, absolute, singular, suffix, m, instead, of, n, the, masculine, determined, plural, suffix, ayy, has, an, alternative, version, the, alternative, is, sometimes, called, the, gentilic, plural, for, its, prominent, use, in, ethnonyms, y, h, y, the, jews, for, example, this, alternative, plural, is, written, with, the, letter, aleph, and, came, to, be, the, only, plural, for, nouns, and, adjectives, of, this, type, in, syriac, and, some, other, varieties, of, aramaic, the, masculine, construct, plural, is, written, with, yodh, in, syriac, and, some, other, variants, this, ending, is, diphthongized, to, ai, possessive, phrases, in, aramaic, can, either, be, made, with, the, construct, state, or, by, linking, two, nouns, with, the, relative, particle, as, the, use, of, the, construct, state, almost, disappears, from, the, middle, aramaic, period, on, the, latter, method, became, the, main, way, of, making, possessive, phrases, for, example, the, various, forms, of, possessive, phrases, for, the, handwriting, of, the, queen, are, in, modern, aramaic, the, last, form, is, by, far, the, most, common, in, biblical, aramaic, the, last, form, is, virtually, absent, the, aramaic, verb, has, gradually, evolved, in, time, and, place, varying, between, varieties, of, the, language, verb, forms, are, marked, for, person, first, second, or, third, number, singular, or, plural, gender, masculine, or, feminine, tense, perfect, or, imperfect, mood, indicative, imperative, jussive, or, infinitive, and, voice, active, reflexive, or, passive, aramaic, also, employs, a, system, of, conjugations, or, verbal, stems, to, mark, intensive, and, extensive, developments, in, the, lexical, meaning, of, verbs, aramaic, has, two, proper, tenses, perfect, and, imperfect, these, were, originally, aspectual, but, developed, into, something, more, like, a, preterite, and, future, the, perfect, is, unmarked, while, the, imperfect, uses, various, preformatives, that, vary, according, to, person, number, and, gender, in, both, tenses, the, third, person, singular, masculine, is, the, unmarked, form, from, which, others, are, derived, by, addition, of, afformatives, and, preformatives, in, the, imperfect, in, the, chart, below, on, the, root, k, t, b, meaning, to, write, the, first, form, given, is, the, usual, form, in, imperial, aramaic, while, the, second, is, classical, syriac, like, other, semitic, languages, aramaic, employs, a, number, of, derived, verb, stems, to, extend, the, lexical, coverage, of, verbs, the, basic, form, of, the, verb, is, called, the, ground, stem, or, g, stem, following, the, tradition, of, mediaeval, arabic, grammarians, it, is, more, often, called, the, p, al, also, written, pe, al, using, the, form, of, the, semitic, root, p, l, meaning, to, do, this, stem, carries, the, basic, lexical, meaning, of, the, verb, by, doubling, of, the, second, radical, or, root, letter, the, d, stem, or, pa, el, is, formed, this, is, often, an, intensive, development, of, the, basic, lexical, meaning, for, example, q, al, means, he, killed, whereas, qa, el, means, he, slew, the, precise, relationship, in, meaning, between, the, two, stems, differs, for, every, verb, a, preformative, which, can, be, ha, a, or, a, creates, the, c, stem, or, variously, the, hap, el, ap, el, or, ap, el, also, spelt, haph, el, aph, el, and, shaph, el, this, is, often, an, extensive, or, causative, development, of, the, basic, lexical, meaning, for, example, means, he, went, astray, whereas, a, means, he, deceived, the, ap, el, is, the, least, common, variant, of, the, c, stem, because, this, variant, is, standard, in, akkadian, it, is, possible, that, its, use, in, aramaic, represents, loanwords, from, that, language, the, difference, between, the, variants, hap, el, and, ap, el, appears, to, be, the, gradual, dropping, of, the, initial, h, sound, in, later, old, aramaic, this, is, noted, by, the, respelling, of, the, older, he, preformative, with, aleph, these, three, conjugations, are, supplemented, with, three, further, derived, stems, produced, by, the, preformative, hi, or, e, the, loss, of, the, initial, h, sound, occurs, similarly, to, that, in, the, form, above, these, three, derived, stems, are, the, gt, stem, hi, p, el, or, e, p, el, also, written, hithpe, el, or, ethpe, el, the, dt, stem, hi, pa, al, or, e, pa, al, also, written, hithpa, al, or, ethpa, al, and, the, ct, stem, hi, hap, al, ettap, al, hi, tap, al, or, e, tap, al, also, written, hithhaph, al, ettaph, al, hishtaph, al, or, eshtaph, al, their, meaning, is, usually, reflexive, but, later, became, passive, however, as, with, other, stems, actual, meaning, differs, from, verb, to, verb, not, all, verbs, use, all, of, these, conjugations, and, in, some, the, g, stem, is, not, used, in, the, chart, below, on, the, root, k, t, b, meaning, to, write, the, first, form, given, is, the, usual, form, in, imperial, aramaic, while, the, second, is, classical, syriac, in, imperial, aramaic, the, participle, began, to, be, used, for, a, historical, present, perhaps, under, influence, from, other, languages, middle, aramaic, developed, a, system, of, composite, tenses, combinations, of, forms, of, the, verb, with, pronouns, or, an, auxiliary, verb, allowing, for, narrative, that, is, more, vivid, aramaic, syntax, usually, follows, the, order, verb, subject, object, vso, imperial, persian, aramaic, however, tended, to, follow, a, s, o, v, pattern, similar, to, akkadian, which, was, the, result, of, persian, syntactic, influence
