thai, or, central, thai, historically, siamese, thai, is, a, tai, language, of, the, kra, dai, language, family, spoken, by, the, central, thai, mon, lao, wiang, phuan, people, in, central, thailand, and, the, vast, majority, of, thai, chinese, enclaves, throughout, the, country, it, is, the, sole, official, language, of, thailand, thai, is, the, most, spoken, of, over, 60, languages, of, thailand, by, both, number, of, native, and, overall, speakers, over, half, of, its, vocabulary, is, derived, from, or, borrowed, from, pali, sanskrit, mon, and, old, khmer, it, is, a, tonal, and, analytic, language, thai, has, a, complex, orthography, and, system, of, relational, markers, spoken, thai, depending, on, standard, sociolinguistic, factors, such, as, age, gender, class, spatial, proximity, and, the, urban, rural, divide, is, partly, mutually, intelligible, with, lao, isan, and, some, fellow, thai, topolects, these, languages, are, written, with, slightly, different, scripts, but, are, linguistically, similar, and, effectively, form, a, dialect, continuum, thai, language, is, spoken, by, over, 69, million, people, 2020, moreover, most, thais, in, the, northern, lanna, and, the, northeastern, isan, parts, of, the, country, today, are, bilingual, speakers, of, central, thai, and, their, respective, regional, dialects, because, central, thai, is, the, language, of, television, education, news, reporting, and, all, forms, of, media, a, recent, research, found, that, the, speakers, of, the, northern, thai, language, also, known, as, phasa, mueang, or, kham, mueang, have, become, so, few, as, most, people, in, northern, thailand, now, invariably, speak, standard, thai, so, that, they, are, now, using, mostly, central, thai, words, and, only, seasoning, their, speech, with, the, kham, mueang, accent, standard, thai, is, based, on, the, register, of, the, educated, classes, by, central, thai, and, ethnic, minorities, in, the, area, along, the, ring, surrounding, the, metropolis, in, addition, to, central, thai, thailand, is, home, to, other, related, tai, languages, although, most, linguists, classify, these, dialects, as, related, but, distinct, languages, native, speakers, often, identify, them, as, regional, variants, or, dialects, of, the, same, thai, language, or, as, different, kinds, of, thai, as, a, dominant, language, in, all, aspects, of, society, in, thailand, thai, initially, saw, gradual, and, later, widespread, adoption, as, a, second, language, among, the, country, s, minority, ethnic, groups, from, the, mid, late, ayutthaya, period, onward, ethnic, minorities, today, are, predominantly, bilingual, speaking, thai, alongside, their, native, language, or, dialect, standard, thai, is, classified, as, one, of, the, chiang, saen, languages, others, being, northern, thai, southern, thai, and, numerous, smaller, languages, which, together, with, the, northwestern, tai, and, lao, phutai, languages, form, the, southwestern, branch, of, tai, languages, the, tai, languages, are, a, branch, of, the, kra, dai, language, family, which, encompasses, a, large, number, of, indigenous, languages, spoken, in, an, arc, from, hainan, and, guangxi, south, through, laos, and, northern, vietnam, to, the, cambodian, border, standard, thai, is, the, principal, language, of, education, and, government, and, spoken, throughout, thailand, the, standard, is, based, on, the, dialect, of, the, central, thai, people, and, it, is, written, in, the, thai, script, hlai, languages, kam, sui, languages, kra, languages, be,

language, phuthai, language, lao, language, pdr, lao, isan, language, thai, has, undergone, various, historical, sound, changes, some, of, the, most, significant, changes, occurred, during, the, evolution, from, old, thai, to, modern, thai, the, thai, writing, system, has, an, eight, century, history, and, many, of, these, changes, especially, in, consonants, and, tones, are, evidenced, in, the, modern, orthography, according, to, a, chinese, source, during, the, ming, dynasty, yingya, shenglan, 1405, 1433, ma, huan, reported, on, the, language, of, the, xi, nlu, or, ayutthaya, kingdom, saying, that, it, somewhat, resembled, the, local, patois, as, pronounced, in, guangdong, 107, ayutthaya, the, old, capital, of, thailand, from, 1351, 1767, a, d, was, from, the, beginning, a, bilingual, society, speaking, thai, and, khmer, bilingualism, must, have, been, strengthened, and, maintained, for, some, time, by, the, great, number, of, khmer, speaking, captives, the, thais, took, from, angkor, thom, after, their, victories, in, 1369, 1388, and, 1431, gradually, toward, the, end, of, the, period, a, language, shift, took, place, khmer, fell, out, of, use, both, thai, and, khmer, descendants, whose, great, grand, parents, or, earlier, ancestors, were, bilingual, came, to, use, only, thai, in, the, process, of, language, shift, an, abundance, of, khmer, elements, were, transferred, into, thai, and, permeated, all, aspects, of, the, language, consequently, the, thai, of, the, late, ayutthaya, period, which, later, became, ratanakosin, or, bangkok, thai, was, a, thorough, mixture, of, thai, and, khmer, there, were, more, khmer, words, in, use, than, tai, cognates, khmer, grammatical, rules, were, used, actively, to, coin, new, disyllabic, and, polysyllabic, words, and, phrases, khmer, expressions, sayings, and, proverbs, were, expressed, in, thai, through, transference, thais, borrowed, both, the, royal, vocabulary, and, rules, to, enlarge, the, vocabulary, from, khmer, the, thais, later, developed, the, royal, vocabulary, according, to, their, immediate, environment, thai, and, pali, the, latter, from, theravada, buddhism, were, added, to, the, vocabulary, an, investigation, of, the, ayutthaya, rajasap, reveals, that, three, languages, thai, khmer, and, khmero, indic, were, at, work, closely, both, in, formulaic, expressions, and, in, normal, discourse, in, fact, khmero, indic, may, be, classified, in, the, same, category, as, khmer, because, indic, had, been, adapted, to, the, khmer, system, first, before, the, thai, borrowed, old, thai, had, a, three, way, tone, distinction, on, live, syllables, those, not, ending, in, a, stop, with, no, possible, distinction, on, dead, syllables, those, ending, in, a, stop, i, e, either, p, t, k, or, the, glottal, stop, that, automatically, closes, syllables, otherwise, ending, in, a, short, vowel, there, was, a, two, way, voiced, vs, voiceless, distinction, among, all, fricative, and, sonorant, consonants, and, up, to, a, four, way, distinction, among, stops, and, affricates, the, maximal, four, way, occurred, in, labials, p, p, b, b, and, denti, alveolars, t, t, d, d, the, three, way, distinction, among, velars, k, k, and, palatals, t, t, d, with, the, glottalized, member, of, each, set, apparently, missing, the, major, change, between, old, and, modern, thai, was, due, to, voicing, distinction, losses, and, the, concomitant, tone, split, this, may, have, happened, between, about, 1300, and, 1600, ce, possibly, occurring, at, different, times, in, different, parts, of, the, thai, speaking, area, all, voiced, voiceless, pairs, of, consonants, lost, the, voicing, distinction, however, in, the, process, of, these, mergers, the, former, distinction, of, voice, was, transferred, into, a, new, set, of, tonal, distinctions, in, essence, every, tone, in, old, thai, split, into, two, new, tones, with, a, lower, pitched, tone, corresponding, to, a, syllable, that, formerly, began, with, a, voiced, consonant, and, a, higher, pitched, tone, corresponding, to, a, syllable, that, formerly, began, with, a, voiceless, consonant, including, glottalized, stops, an, additional, complication, is, that, formerly, voiceless, unaspirated, stops, affricates, original, p, t, k, t, b, d, also, caused, original, tone, 1, to, lower, but, had, no, such, effect, on, original, tones, 2, or, 3, the, above, consonant, mergers, and, tone, splits, account, for, the, complex, relationship, between, spelling, and, sound, in, modern, thai, modern, low, class, consonants, were, voiced, in, old, thai, and, the, terminology, low, reflects, the, lower, tone, variants, that, resulted, modern, mid, class, consonants, were, voiceless, unaspirated, stops, or, affricates, in, old, thai, precisely, the, class, that, triggered, lowering, in, original, tone, 1, but, not, tones, 2, or, 3, modern, high, class, consonants, were, the, remaining, voiceless, consonants, in, old, thai, voiceless, fricatives, voiceless, sonorants, voiceless, aspirated, stops, the, three, most, common, tone, marks, the, lack, of, any, tone, mark, as, well, as, the, two, marks, termed, mai, ek, and, mai, tho, represent, the, three, tones, of, old, thai, and, the, complex, relationship, between, tone, mark, and, actual, tone, is, due, to, the, various, tonal, changes, since, then, since, the, tone, split, the, tones, have, changed, in, actual, representation, to, the, point, that, the, former, relationship, between, lower, and, higher, tonal, variants, has, been, completely, obscured, furthermore, the, six, tones, that, resulted, after, the, three, tones, of, old, thai, were, split, have, since, merged, into, five, in, standard, thai, with, the, lower, variant, of, former, tone, 2, merging, with, the, higher, variant, of, former, tone, 3, becoming, the, modern, falling, tone, early, old, thai, also, apparently, had, velar, fricatives, x, as, distinct, phonemes, these, were, represented, by, the, now, obsolete, letters, kho, khuat, and, kho, khon, respectively, during, the, old, thai, period, these, sounds, merged, into, the, corresponding, stops, k, and, as, a, result, the, use, of, these, letters, became, unstable, at, some, point, in, the, history, of, thai, an, alveolo, palatal, nasal, phoneme, also, existed, inherited, from, proto, tai, a, letter, yo, ying, also, exists, which, is, used, to, represent, an, alveolo, palatal, nasal, in, words, borrowed, from, sanskrit, and, pali, and, is, currently, pronounced, j, at, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, but, n, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, most, native, thai, words, that, are, reconstructed, as, beginning, with, are, also, pronounced, j, in, modern, thai, but, generally, spelled, with, yo, yak, which, consistently, represents, j, this, suggests, that, j, in, native, words, occurred, in, the, pre, literary, period, it, is, unclear, whether, sanskrit, and, pali, words, beginning, with, were, borrowed, directly, with, a, j, or, whether, a, was, re, introduced, followed, by, a, second, change, j, the, northeastern, thai, dialect, isan, and, the, lao, language, still, preserve, the, phoneme, which, is, represented, in, the, lao, script, by, such, as, in, the, word, mosquito, this, letter, is, distinct, from, the, phoneme, j, and, its, lao, letter, such, as, in, the, word, j, medicine, the, distinction, in, writing, has, been, lost, in, the, informal, writing, of, the, isan, language, with, the, thai, script, and, both, sounds, are, represented, by, j, see, comparison, of, lao, and, isan, proto, tai, also, had, a, glottalized, palatal, sound, reconstructed, as, j, in, li, fang, kuei, 1977, corresponding, thai, words, are, generally, spelled, which, implies, an, old, thai, pronunciation, of, hj, or, j, but, a, few, such, words, are, spelled, which, implies, a, pronunciation, of, j, and, suggests, that, the, glottalization, may, have, persisted, through, to, the, early, literary, period, the, vowel, system, of, modern, thai, contains, nine, pure, vowels, and, three, centering, diphthongs, each, of, which, can, occur, short, or, long, according, to, li, 1977, however, many, thai, dialects, have, only, one, such, short, long, pair, a, a, and, in, general, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, find, minimal, short, long, pairs, in, thai, that, involve, vowels, other, than, a, and, where, both, members, have, frequent, correspondences, throughout, the, tai, languages, more, specifically, he, notes, the, following, facts, about, thai, furthermore, the, vowel, that, corresponds, to, short, thai, a, has, a, different, and, often, higher, quality, in, many, of, the, tai, languages, compared, with, the, vowel, corresponding, to, thai, a, this, leads, li, to, posit, the, following, not, all, researchers, agree, with, li, pittayaporn, 2009, for, example, reconstructs, a, similar, system, for, proto, southwestern, tai, but, believes, that, there, was, also, a, mid, back, unrounded, vowel, which, he, describes, as, occurring, only, before, final, velar, k, he, also, seems, to, believe, that, the, proto, southwestern, tai, vowel, length, distinctions, can, be, reconstructed, back, to, similar, distinctions, in, proto, tai, standard, thai, distinguishes, three, voice, onset, times, among, plosive, and, affricate, consonants, where, english, makes, a, distinction, between, voiced, b, and, unvoiced, aspirated, p, thai, distinguishes, a, third, sound, the, unvoiced, unaspirated, p, that, occurs, in, english, only, as, an, allophone, of, p, for, example, after, an, s, as, in, the, sound, of, the, p, in, spin, there, is, similarly, a, laminal, denti, alveolar, d, t, t, triplet, in, thai, in, the, velar, series, there, is, a, k, k, pair, and, in, the, postalveolar, series, a, t, t, pair, but, the, language, lacks, the, corresponding, voiced, sounds, and, d, in, loanwords, from, english, english, and, d, are, borrowed, as, the, tenuis, stops, k, and, t, in, each, cell, below, the, first, line, indicates, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, the, second, indicates, the, thai, characters, in, initial, position, several, letters, appearing, in, the, same, box, have, identical, pronunciation, the, letter, one, of, the, two, h, letters, is, also, used, to, help, write, certain, tones, described, below, although, the, overall, 44, thai, consonant, letters, provide, 21, sounds, in, case, of, initials, the, case, for, finals, is, different, for, finals, only, eight, sounds, as, well, as, no, sound, called, m, tr, are, used, to, demonstrate, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, b, and, d, are, devoiced, becoming, pronounced, as, p, and, t, respectively, additionally, all, plosive, sounds, are, unreleased, hence, final, p, t, and, k, sounds, are, pronounced, as, and, respectively, of, the, consonant, letters, excluding, the, disused, and, six, cannot, be, used, as, a, final, and, the, other, 36, are, grouped, as, following, in, thai, each, syllable, in, a, word, is, articulated, independently, so, consonants, from, adjacent, syllables, i, e, heterosyllabic, show, no, sign, of, articulation, as, a, cluster, thai, has, specific, phonotactical, patterns, that, describe, its, syllable, structure, including, tautosyllabic, consonant, clusters, and, vowel, sequences, in, core, thai, words, i, e, excluding, loanwords, only, clusters, of, two, consonants, occur, of, which, there, are, 11, combinations, the, number, of, clusters, increases, in, loanwords, such, as, t, r, in, n, t, r, from, sanskrit, indr, or, fr, in, fr, from, english, free, however, these, usually, only, occur, in, initial, position, with, either, r, l, or, w, as, the, second, consonant, sound, and, not, more, than, two, sounds, at, a, time, the, vowel, nuclei, of, the, thai, language, are, given, in, the, following, table, the, top, entry, in, every, cell, is, the, symbol, from, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, the, second, entry, gives, the, spelling, in, the, thai, script, where, a, dash, indicates, the, position, of, the, initial, consonant, after, which, the, vowel, is, pronounced, a, second, dash, indicates, that, a, final, consonant, follows, each, vowel, quality, occurs, in, long, short, pairs, these, are, distinct, phonemes, forming, distinct, words, in, thai, the, long, short, pairs, are, as, follows, there, are, also, opening, and, closing, diphthongs, in, thai, which, tingsabadh, abramson, 1993, analyze, as, vj, and, vw, for, purposes, of, determining, tone, those, marked, with, an, asterisk, are, sometimes, classified, as, long, additionally, there, are, three, triphthongs, for, purposes, of, determining, tone, those, marked, with, an, asterisk, are, sometimes, classified, as, long, there, are, five, phonemic, tones, mid, low, falling, high, and, rising, sometimes, referred, to, in, older, reference, works, as, rectus, gravis, circumflexus, altus, and, demissus, respectively, the, table, shows, an, example, of, both, the, phonemic, tones, and, their, phonetic, realization, in, the, ipa, moren, zsiga, 2006, and, zsiga, nitisaroj, 2007, provide, phonetic, and, phonological, analyses, of, thai, tone, realization, notes, in, some, english, loanwords, closed, syllables, with, a, long, vowel, ending, in, an, obstruent, sound, have, a, high, tone, and, closed, syllables, with, a, short, vowel, ending, in, an, obstruent, sound, have, a, falling, tone, from, the, perspective, of, linguistic, typology, thai, can, be, considered, to, be, an, analytic, language, the, word, order, is, subject, verb, object, although, the, subject, is, often, omitted, additionally, thai, is, an, isolating, language, lacking, any, form, of, inflectional, morphology, whatsoever, thai, pronouns, are, selected, according, to, the, gender, and, relative, status, of, speaker, and, audience, there, is, no, morphological, distinction, between, adverbs, and, adjectives, many, words, can, be, used, in, either, function, they, follow, the, word, they, modify, which, may, be, a, noun, verb, or, another, adjective, or, adverb, khon, k, n, uan, an, khon, uan, k, n, an, a, fat, person,

used, to, indicate, tense, in, verbs, see, verbs, tense, below, may, be, used, to, describe, adjectives, chan, t, n, hio, h, w, chan, hio, t, n, h, w, i, am, hungry, chan, t, n, cha, t, hio, h, w,

however, not, obligatory, and, often, left, out, in, colloquial, use, in, such, cases, the, precise, meaning, is, determined, through, context, this, results, in, sentences, lacking, both, tam,

there, i, eat, there, habitually, i, will, eat, there, or, i, ate, there, aspect, markers, in, thai, have, been, divided, into, four, distinct, groups, based, on, their, usage, these, markers, could, appear, either, before, or, after, the, verb, the, following, list, describes, some, of, the, most, commonly, used, aspect, markers, a, number, of, these, aspect, markers, are, also, full, verbs, on, their, own, and, carry, a, distinct, meaning, for, example, yu, as, a, full, verb, means, to, stay, to, live, or, to, remain, at, however, as, an, auxiliary, it, can, be, described, as, a, temporary, aspect, or, continuative, marker, the, imperfective, aspect, marker, kamlang, k, m, l, currently, is, used, before, the, verb, to, denote, an, ongoing, action, similar, to, the, ing, suffix, in, english, kamlang, is, commonly, interpreted, as, a, progressive, aspect, marker, similarly, yu, j, is, a, post, verbal, aspect, marker, which, corresponds, to, the, continuative, or, temporary, aspect, khao, k, w, kamlang, k, m, l, wing, w, khao, kamlang, wing, k, w, k, m, l, w, khao, k, w, wing, w, yu, j, khao, wing, yu, k, w, w, j, khao, k, w, kamlang, k, m, l, wing, w, yu, j, khao,

past, tense, marker, when, it, occurs, before, the, verb, as, a, full, verb, dai, means, to, get, or, receive, however, when, used, after, a, verb, dai, takes, on, a, meaning, of, potentiality, or, successful, outcome, of, the, main, verb, khao, k, w, dai, d, j, pai, p, j, thiao, t, aw, mueang, m, a, lao, l, w, khao, dai, pai, thiao, mueang, lao, k, w, d, j, p, j, t, aw, m, a, l, w, he, visited,

meanings, in, addition, to, its, use, as, a, tam, marker, laeo, can, either, be, a, conjunction, for, sequential, actions, or, an, archaic, word, for, to, finish, khao, k, w, 3sg, dai, d, j, pst, kin,
