citizenship, is, a, membership, and, allegiance, to, a, sovereign, state, though, citizenship, is, often, conflated, with, nationality, in, today, s, english, speaking, world, international, law, does, not, usually, use, the, term, citizenship, to, refer, to, nationality, these, two, notions, being, conceptually, different, dimensions, of, collective, membership, generally, citizenships, have, no, expiration, and, allow, persons, to, work, reside, and, vote, in, the, polity, as, well, as, identify, with, the, polity, possibly, acquiring, a, passport, though, through, discriminatory, laws, like, disfranchisement, and, outright, apartheid, citizens, have, been, made, second, class, citizens, historically, populations, of, states, were, mostly, subjects, while, citizenship, was, a, particular, status, which, originated, in, the, rights, of, urban, populations, like, the, rights, of, the, male, public, of, cities, and, republics, particularly, ancient, city, states, giving, rise, to, a, civitas, and, the, social, class, of, the, burgher, or, bourgeoisie, since, then, states, have, expanded, the, status, of, citizenship, to, most, of, their, national, people, while, the, extent, of, citizen, rights, remain, contested, conceptually, citizenship, and, nationality, are, different, dimensions, of, state, membership, citizenship, is, focused, on, the, internal, political, life, of, the, state, and, nationality, is, the, dimension, of, state, membership, in, international, law, article, 15, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, states, that, everyone, has, the, right, to, nationality, as, such, nationality, in, international, law, can, be, called, and, understood, as, citizenship, or, more, generally, as, subject, or, belonging, to, a, sovereign, state, and, not, as, ethnicity, this, notwithstanding, around, 10, million, people, are, stateless, today, the, concept, of, full, citizenship, encompasses, not, only, active, political, rights, but, full, civil, rights, and, social, rights, a, person, can, be, recognized, as, a, citizen, on, a, number, of, bases, every, citizen, has, obligations, that, are, required, by, law, and, some, responsibilities, that, benefit, the, community, obeying, the, laws, of, a, country, and, paying, taxes, are, some, of, the, obligations, required, of, citizens, by, law, voting, and, community, services, form, part, of, responsibilities, of, a, citizen, that, benefits, the, community, the, constitution, of, ghana, 1992, article, 41, obligates, citizens, to, promote, the, prestige, and, good, name, of, ghana, and, respect, the, symbols, of, ghana, examples, of, national, symbols, includes, the, ghanaian, flag, coat, of, arms, money, and, state, sword, these, national, symbols, must, be, treated, with, respect, and, high, esteem, by, citizens, since, they, best, represent, ghanaians, apart, from, responsibilities, citizens, also, have, rights, some, of, the, rights, are, the, right, to, pursue, life, liberty, and, happiness, the, right, to, worship, right, to, run, for, elected, office, and, right, to, express, oneself, many, thinkers, such, as, giorgio, agamben, in, his, work, extending, the, biopolitical, framework, of, foucault, s, history, of, sexuality, in, the, book, homo, sacer, point, to, the, concept, of, citizenship, beginning, in, the, early, city, states, of, ancient, greece, although, others, see, it, as, primarily, a, modern, phenomenon, dating, back, only, a, few, hundred, years, and, for, humanity, that, the, concept, of, citizenship, arose, with, the, first, laws, polis, meant, both, the, political, assembly, of, the, city, state, as, well, as, the, entire, society, citizenship, concept, has, generally, been, identified, as, a, western, phenomenon, there, is, a, general, view, that, citizenship, in, ancient, times, was, a, simpler, relation, than, modern, forms, of, citizenship, although, this, view, has, come, under, scrutiny, the, relation, of, citizenship, has, not, been, a, fixed, or, static, relation, but, constantly, changed, within, each, society, and, that, according, to, one, view, citizenship, might, really, have, worked, only, at, select, periods, during, certain, times, such, as, when, the, athenian, politician, solon, made, reforms, in, the, early, athenian, state, citizenship, was, also, contingent, on, a, variety, of, biopolitical, assemblages, such, as, the, bioethics, of, emerging, theo, philosophical, traditions, it, was, necessary, to, fit, aristotle, s, definition, of, the, besouled, the, animate, to, obtain, citizenship, neither, the, sacred, olive, tree, nor, spring, would, have, any, rights, an, essential, part, of, the, framework, of, greco, roman, ethics, is, the, figure, of, homo, sacer, or, the, bare, life, historian, geoffrey, hosking, in, his, 2005, modern, scholar, lecture, course, suggested, that, citizenship, in, ancient, greece, arose, from, an, appreciation, for, the, importance, of, freedom, hosking, explained, it, can, be, argued, that, this, growth, of, slavery, was, what, made, greeks, particularly, conscious, of, the, value, of, freedom, after, all, any, greek, farmer, might, fall, into, debt, and, therefore, might, become, a, slave, at, almost, any, time, when, the, greeks, fought, together, they, fought, in, order, to, avoid, being, enslaved, by, warfare, to, avoid, being, defeated, by, those, who, might, take, them, into, slavery, and, they, also, arranged, their, political, institutions, so, as, to, remain, free, men, slavery, permitted, slave, owners, to, have, substantial, free, time, and, enabled, participation, in, public, life, polis, citizenship, was, marked, by, exclusivity, inequality, of, status, was, widespread, citizens, polit, s, city, had, a, higher, status, than, non, citizens, such, as, women, slaves, and, resident, foreigners, metics, the, first, form, of, citizenship, was, based, on, the, way, people, lived, in, the, ancient, greek, times, in, small, scale, organic, communities, of, the, polis, the, obligations, of, citizenship, were, deeply, connected, to, one, s, everyday, life, in, the, polis, these, small, scale, organic, communities, were, generally, seen, as, a, new, development, in, world, history, in, contrast, to, the, established, ancient, civilizations, of, egypt, or, persia, or, the, hunter, gatherer, bands, elsewhere, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, ancient, greeks, a, person, s, public, life, could, not, be, separated, from, their, private, life, and, greeks, did, not, distinguish, between, the, two, worlds, according, to, the, modern, western, conception, the, obligations, of, citizenship, were, deeply, connected, with, everyday, life, to, be, truly, human, one, had, to, be, an, active, citizen, to, the, community, which, aristotle, famously, expressed, to, take, no, part, in, the, running, of, the, community, s, affairs, is, to, be, either, a, beast, or, a, god, this, form, of, citizenship, was, based, on, the, obligations, of, citizens, towards, the, community, rather, than, rights, given, to, the, citizens, of, the, community, this, was, not, a, problem, because, they, all, had, a, strong, affinity, with, the, polis, their, own, destiny, and, the, destiny, of, the, community, were, strongly, linked, also, citizens, of, the, polis, saw, obligations, to, the, community, as, an, opportunity, to, be, virtuous, it, was, a, source, of, honor, and, respect, in, athens, citizens, were, both, rulers, and, ruled, important, political, and, judicial, offices, were, rotated, and, all, citizens, had, the, right, to, speak, and, vote, in, the, political, assembly, in, the, roman, empire, citizenship, expanded, from, small, scale, communities, to, the, entirety, of, the, empire, romans, realized, that, granting, citizenship, to, people, from, all, over, the, empire, legitimized, roman, rule, over, conquered, areas, roman, citizenship, was, no, longer, a, status, of, political, agency, as, it, had, been, reduced, to, a, judicial, safeguard, and, the, expression, of, rule, and, law, rome, carried, forth, greek, ideas, of, citizenship, such, as, the, principles, of, equality, under, the, law, civic, participation, in, government, and, notions, that, no, one, citizen, should, have, too, much, power, for, too, long, but, rome, offered, relatively, generous, terms, to, its, captives, including, chances, for, lesser, forms, of, citizenship, if, greek, citizenship, was, an, emancipation, from, the, world, of, things, the, roman, sense, increasingly, reflected, the, fact, that, citizens, could, act, upon, material, things, as, well, as, other, citizens, in, the, sense, of, buying, or, selling, property, possessions, titles, goods, one, historian, explained, the, person, was, defined, and, represented, through, his, actions, upon, things, in, the, course, of, time, the, term, property, came, to, mean, first, the, defining, characteristic, of, a, human, or, other, being, second, the, relation, which, a, person, had, with, a, thing, and, third, the, thing, defined, as, the, possession, of, some, person, roman, citizenship, reflected, a, struggle, between, the, upper, class, patrician, interests, against, the, lower, order, working, groups, known, as, the, plebeian, class, a, citizen, came, to, be, understood, as, a, person, free, to, act, by, law, free, to, ask, and, expect, the, law, s, protection, a, citizen, of, such, and, such, a, legal, community, of, such, and, such, a, legal, standing, in, that, community, citizenship, meant, having, rights, to, have, possessions, immunities, expectations, which, were, available, in, many, kinds, and, degrees, available, or, unavailable, to, many, kinds, of, person, for, many, kinds, of, reason, the, law, itself, was, a, kind, of, bond, uniting, people, roman, citizenship, was, more, impersonal, universal, multiform, having, different, degrees, and, applications, during, the, european, middle, ages, citizenship, was, usually, associated, with, cities, and, towns, see, medieval, commune, and, applied, mainly, to, middle, class, folk, titles, such, as, burgher, grand, burgher, german, gro, b, rger, and, the, bourgeoisie, denoted, political, affiliation, and, identity, in, relation, to, a, particular, locality, as, well, as, membership, in, a, mercantile, or, trading, class, thus, individuals, of, respectable, means, and, socioeconomic, status, were, interchangeable, with, citizens, during, this, era, members, of, the, nobility, had, a, range, of, privileges, above, commoners, see, aristocracy, though, political, upheavals, and, reforms, beginning, most, prominently, with, the, french, revolution, abolished, privileges, and, created, an, egalitarian, concept, of, citizenship, during, the, renaissance, people, transitioned, from, being, subjects, of, a, king, or, queen, to, being, citizens, of, a, city, and, later, to, a, nation, p, 161, each, city, had, its, own, law, courts, and, independent, administration, and, being, a, citizen, often, meant, being, subject, to, the, city, s, law, in, addition, to, having, power, in, some, instances, to, help, choose, officials, city, dwellers, who, had, fought, alongside, nobles, in, battles, to, defend, their, cities, were, no, longer, content, with, having, a, subordinate, social, status, but, demanded, a, greater, role, in, the, form, of, citizenship, membership, in, guilds, was, an, indirect, form, of, citizenship, in, that, it, helped, their, members, succeed, financially, the, rise, of, citizenship, was, linked, to, the, rise, of, republicanism, according, to, one, account, since, independent, citizens, meant, that, kings, had, less, power, citizenship, became, an, idealized, almost, abstract, concept, and, did, not, signify, a, submissive, relation, with, a, lord, or, count, but, rather, indicated, the, bond, between, a, person, and, the, state, in, the, rather, abstract, sense, of, having, rights, and, duties, the, modern, idea, of, citizenship, still, respects, the, idea, of, political, participation, but, it, is, usually, done, through, elaborate, systems, of, political, representation, at, a, distance, such, as, representative, democracy, modern, citizenship, is, much, more, passive, action, is, delegated, to, others, citizenship, is, often, a, constraint, on, acting, not, an, impetus, to, act, nevertheless, citizens, are, usually, aware, of, their, obligations, to, authorities, and, are, aware, that, these, bonds, often, limit, what, they, can, do, from, 1790, until, the, mid, twentieth, century, united, states, law, used, racial, criteria, to, establish, citizenship, rights, and, regulate, who, was, eligible, to, become, a, naturalized, citizen, the, naturalization, act, of, 1790, the, first, law, in, u, s, history, to, establish, rules, for, citizenship, and, naturalization, barred, citizenship, to, all, people, who, were, not, of, european, descent, stating, that, any, alien, being, a, free, white, person, who, shall, have, resided, within, the, limits, and, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, united, states, for, the, term, of, two, years, maybe, admitted, to, becoming, a, citizen, thereof, under, early, u, s, laws, african, americans, were, not, eligible, for, citizenship, in, 1857, these, laws, were, upheld, in, the, us, supreme, court, case, dred, scott, v, sandford, which, ruled, that, a, free, negro, of, the, african, race, whose, ancestors, were, brought, to, this, country, and, sold, as, slaves, is, not, a, citizen, within, the, meaning, of, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, and, that, the, special, rights, and, immunities, guaranteed, to, citizens, do, not, apply, to, them, it, was, not, until, the, abolition, of, slavery, following, the, american, civil, war, that, african, americans, were, granted, citizenship, rights, the, 14th, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, ratified, on, july, 9, 1868, stated, that, all, persons, born, or, naturalized, in, the, united, states, and, subject, to, the, jurisdiction, thereof, are, citizens, of, the, united, states, and, of, the, state, wherein, they, reside, two, years, later, the, naturalization, act, of, 1870, would, extend, the, right, to, become, a, naturalized, citizen, to, include, aliens, of, african, nativity, and, to, persons, of, african, descent, despite, the, gains, made, by, african, americans, after, the, civil, war, native, americans, asians, and, others, not, considered, free, white, persons, were, still, denied, the, ability, to, become, citizens, the, 1882, chinese, exclusion, act, explicitly, denied, naturalization, rights, to, all, people, of, chinese, origin, while, subsequent, acts, passed, by, the, us, congress, such, as, laws, in, 1906, 1917, and, 1924, would, include, clauses, that, denied, immigration, and, naturalization, rights, to, people, based, on, broadly, defined, racial, categories, supreme, court, cases, such, as, ozawa, v, the, united, states, 1922, and, u, s, v, bhagat, singh, thind, 1923, would, later, clarify, the, meaning, of, the, phrase, free, white, persons, ruling, that, ethnically, japanese, indian, and, other, non, european, people, were, not, white, persons, and, were, therefore, ineligible, for, naturalization, under, u, s, law, native, americans, were, not, granted, full, us, citizenship, until, the, passage, of, the, indian, citizenship, act, in, 1924, however, even, well, into, the, 1960s, some, state, laws, prevented, native, americans, from, exercising, their, full, rights, as, citizens, such, as, the, right, to, vote, in, 1962, new, mexico, became, the, last, state, to, enfranchise, native, americans, it, was, not, until, the, passage, of, the, immigration, and, nationality, act, of, 1952, that, the, racial, and, gender, restrictions, for, naturalization, were, explicitly, abolished, however, the, act, still, contained, restrictions, regarding, who, was, eligible, for, us, citizenship, and, retained, a, national, quota, system, which, limited, the, number, of, visas, given, to, immigrants, based, on, their, national, origin, to, be, fixed, at, a, rate, of, one, sixth, of, one, percent, of, each, nationality, s, population, in, the, united, states, in, 1920, it, was, not, until, the, passage, of, the, immigration, and, nationality, act, of, 1965, that, these, immigration, quota, systems, were, drastically, altered, in, favor, of, a, less, discriminatory, system, the, 1918, constitution, of, revolutionary, russia, granted, citizenship, to, any, foreigners, who, were, living, within, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, so, long, as, they, were, engaged, in, work, and, to, the, working, class, it, recognized, the, equal, rights, of, all, citizens, irrespective, of, their, racial, or, national, connections, and, declared, oppression, of, any, minority, group, or, race, to, be, contrary, to, the, fundamental, laws, of, the, republic, the, 1918, constitution, also, established, the, right, to, vote, and, be, elected, to, soviets, for, both, men, and, women, irrespective, of, religion, nationality, domicile, etc, who, shall, have, completed, their, eighteenth, year, by, the, day, of, the, election, the, later, constitutions, of, the, ussr, would, grant, universal, soviet, citizenship, to, the, citizens, of, all, member, republics, in, concord, with, the, principles, of, non, discrimination, laid, out, in, the, original, 1918, constitution, of, russia, nazism, the, german, variant, of, twentieth, century, fascism, classified, inhabitants, of, the, country, into, three, main, hierarchical, categories, each, of, which, would, have, different, rights, in, relation, to, the, state, citizens, subjects, and, aliens, the, first, category, citizens, were, to, possess, full, civic, rights, and, responsibilities, citizenship, was, conferred, only, on, males, of, german, or, so, called, aryan, heritage, who, had, completed, military, service, and, could, be, revoked, at, any, time, by, the, state, the, reich, citizenship, law, of, 1935, established, racial, criteria, for, citizenship, in, the, german, reich, and, because, of, this, law, jews, and, others, who, could, not, prove, german, racial, heritage, were, stripped, of, their, citizenship, the, second, category, subjects, referred, to, all, others, who, were, born, within, the, nation, s, boundaries, who, did, not, fit, the, racial, criteria, for, citizenship, subjects, would, have, no, voting, rights, could, not, hold, any, position, within, the, state, and, possessed, none, of, the, other, rights, and, civic, responsibilities, conferred, on, citizens, all, women, were, to, be, conferred, subject, status, upon, birth, and, could, only, obtain, citizen, status, if, they, worked, independently, or, if, they, married, a, german, citizen, see, women, in, nazi, germany, the, final, category, aliens, referred, to, those, who, were, citizens, of, another, state, who, also, had, no, rights, in, 2021, the, german, government, passed, article, 116, 2, of, the, basic, law, which, entitles, the, restoration, of, citizenship, to, individuals, who, had, their, german, citizenship, revoked, on, political, racial, or, religious, grounds, between, 30, january, 1933, and, 8, may, 1945, this, also, entitles, their, descendants, to, german, citizenship, the, primary, principles, of, israeli, citizenship, is, jus, sanguinis, citizenship, by, descent, for, jews, and, jus, soli, citizenship, by, place, of, birth, for, others, many, theorists, suggest, that, there, are, two, opposing, conceptions, of, citizenship, an, economic, one, and, a, political, one, for, further, information, see, history, of, citizenship, citizenship, status, under, social, contract, theory, carries, with, it, both, rights, and, duties, in, this, sense, citizenship, was, described, as, a, bundle, of, rights, primarily, political, participation, in, the, life, of, the, community, the, right, to, vote, and, the, right, to, receive, certain, protection, from, the, community, as, well, as, obligations, citizenship, is, seen, by, most, scholars, as, culture, specific, in, the, sense, that, the, meaning, of, the, term, varies, considerably, from, culture, to, culture, and, over, time, in, china, for, example, there, is, a, cultural, politics, of, citizenship, which, could, be, called, peopleship, argued, by, an, academic, article, how, citizenship, is, understood, depends, on, the, person, making, the, determination, the, relation, of, citizenship, has, never, been, fixed, or, static, but, constantly, changes, within, each, society, while, citizenship, has, varied, considerably, throughout, history, and, within, societies, over, time, there, are, some, common, elements, but, they, vary, considerably, as, well, as, a, bond, citizenship, extends, beyond, basic, kinship, ties, to, unite, people, of, different, genetic, backgrounds, it, usually, signifies, membership, in, a, political, body, it, is, often, based, on, or, was, a, result, of, some, form, of, military, service, or, expectation, of, future, service, it, usually, involves, some, form, of, political, participation, but, this, can, vary, from, token, acts, to, active, service, in, government, it, generally, describes, a, person, with, legal, rights, within, a, given, political, order, it, almost, always, has, an, element, of, exclusion, meaning, that, some, people, are, not, citizens, and, that, this, distinction, can, sometimes, be, very, important, or, not, important, depending, on, a, particular, society, citizenship, as, a, concept, is, generally, hard, to, isolate, intellectually, and, compare, with, related, political, notions, since, it, relates, to, many, other, aspects, of, society, such, as, the, family, military, service, the, individual, freedom, religion, ideas, of, right, and, wrong, ethnicity, and, patterns, for, how, a, person, should, behave, in, society, when, there, are, many, different, groups, within, a, nation, citizenship, may, be, the, only, real, bond, that, unites, everybody, as, equals, without, discrimination, it, is, a, broad, bond, linking, a, person, with, the, state, and, gives, people, a, universal, identity, as, a, legal, member, of, a, specific, nation, modern, citizenship, has, often, been, looked, at, as, two, competing, underlying, ideas, responsibilities, of, citizens, responsibility, is, an, action, that, individuals, of, a, state, or, country, must, take, note, of, in, the, interest, of, a, common, good, these, responsibilities, can, be, categorised, into, personal, and, civic, responsibilities, scholars, suggest, that, the, concept, of, citizenship, contains, many, unresolved, issues, sometimes, called, tensions, existing, within, the, relation, that, continue, to, reflect, uncertainty, about, what, citizenship, is, supposed, to, mean, some, unresolved, issues, regarding, citizenship, include, questions, about, what, is, the, proper, balance, between, duties, and, rights, another, is, a, question, about, what, is, the, proper, balance, between, political, citizenship, versus, social, citizenship, some, thinkers, see, benefits, with, people, being, absent, from, public, affairs, since, too, much, participation, such, as, revolution, can, be, destructive, yet, too, little, participation, such, as, total, apathy, can, be, problematic, as, well, citizenship, can, be, seen, as, a, special, elite, status, and, it, can, also, be, seen, as, a, democratizing, force, and, something, that, everybody, has, the, concept, can, include, both, senses, according, to, sociologist, arthur, stinchcombe, citizenship, is, based, on, the, extent, that, a, person, can, control, one, s, own, destiny, within, the, group, in, the, sense, of, being, able, to, influence, the, government, of, the, group, p, 150, one, last, distinction, within, citizenship, is, the, so, called, consent, descent, distinction, and, this, issue, addresses, whether, citizenship, is, a, fundamental, matter, determined, by, a, person, choosing, to, belong, to, a, particular, nation, by, their, consent, or, is, citizenship, a, matter, of, where, a, person, was, born, that, is, by, their, descent, some, intergovernmental, organizations, have, extended, the, concept, and, terminology, associated, with, citizenship, to, the, international, level, where, it, is, applied, to, the, totality, of, the, citizens, of, their, constituent, countries, combined, citizenship, at, this, level, is, a, secondary, concept, with, rights, deriving, from, national, citizenship, the, maastricht, treaty, introduced, the, concept, of, citizenship, of, the, european, union, article, 17, 1, of, the, treaty, on, european, union, stated, that, citizenship, of, the, union, is, hereby, established, every, person, holding, the, nationality, of, a, member, state, shall, be, a, citizen, of, the, union, citizenship, of, the, union, shall, be, additional, to, and, not, replace, national, citizenship, an, agreement, is, known, as, the, amended, ec, treaty, established, certain, minimal, rights, for, european, union, citizens, article, 12, of, the, amended, ec, treaty, guaranteed, a, general, right, of, non, discrimination, within, the, scope, of, the, treaty, article, 18, provided, a, limited, right, to, free, movement, and, residence, in, the, member, states, other, than, that, of, which, the, european, union, citizen, is, a, national, articles, 18, 21, and, 225, provide, certain, political, rights, union, citizens, have, also, extensive, rights, to, move, in, order, to, exercise, economic, activity, in, any, of, the, member, states, which, predate, the, introduction, of, union, citizenship, citizenship, of, the, mercosur, is, granted, to, eligible, citizens, of, the, southern, common, market, member, states, it, was, approved, in, 2010, through, the, citizenship, statute, and, should, be, fully, implemented, by, the, member, countries, in, 2021, when, the, program, will, be, transformed, in, an, international, treaty, incorporated, into, the, national, legal, system, of, the, countries, under, the, concept, of, mercosur, citizen, the, concept, of, commonwealth, citizenship, has, been, in, place, ever, since, the, establishment, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, as, with, the, eu, one, holds, commonwealth, citizenship, only, by, being, a, citizen, of, a, commonwealth, member, state, this, form, of, citizenship, offers, certain, privileges, within, some, commonwealth, countries, although, ireland, was, excluded, from, the, commonwealth, in, 1949, because, it, declared, itself, a, republic, ireland, is, generally, treated, as, if, it, were, still, a, member, legislation, often, specifically, provides, for, equal, treatment, between, commonwealth, countries, and, ireland, and,
