the, mind, is, that, which, thinks, feels, perceives, imagines, remembers, and, wills, in, other, words, it, encompasses, the, totality, of, mental, phenomena, it, includes, both, conscious, processes, through, which, an, individual, is, aware, of, external, and, internal, circumstances, and, unconscious, processes, which, can, influence, an, individual, without, intention, or, awareness, traditionally, minds, were, often, conceived, as, separate, entities, that, can, exist, on, their, own, but, are, more, commonly, understood, as, features, or, capacities, of, other, entities, in, the, contemporary, discourse, the, mind, plays, a, central, role, in, most, aspects, of, human, life, but, its, exact, nature, is, disputed, some, theorists, suggest, that, all, mental, phenomena, are, private, and, directly, knowable, transform, information, have, the, ability, to, refer, to, and, represent, other, entities, or, are, dispositions, to, engage, in, behavior, the, mind, body, problem, is, the, challenge, of, explaining, the, relation, between, matter, and, mind, the, dominant, position, today, is, physicalism, which, says, that, everything, is, material, meaning, that, minds, are, certain, aspects, or, features, of, some, material, objects, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, mind, is, tied, to, the, development, of, the, nervous, system, which, led, to, the, formation, of, brains, as, brains, became, more, complex, the, number, and, capacity, of, mental, functions, increased, with, particular, brain, areas, dedicated, to, specific, mental, functions, individual, human, minds, also, develop, as, they, learn, from, experience, and, pass, through, psychological, stages, in, the, process, of, aging, some, people, are, affected, by, mental, disorders, for, which, certain, mental, capacities, do, not, function, as, they, should, it, is, widely, accepted, that, animals, have, some, form, of, mind, but, it, is, controversial, to, which, animals, this, applies, the, topic, of, artificial, minds, poses, similar, challenges, with, theorists, discussing, the, possibility, and, consequences, of, creating, them, using, computers, the, main, fields, of, inquiry, studying, the, mind, include, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive, science, and, philosophy, they, tend, to, focus, on, different, aspects, of, the, mind, and, employ, different, methods, of, investigation, ranging, from, empirical, observation, and, neuroimaging, to, conceptual, analysis, and, thought, experiments, the, mind, is, relevant, to, many, other, fields, including, epistemology, anthropology, religion, and, education, the, mind, is, the, totality, of, psychological, phenomena, and, capacities, encompassing, consciousness, thought, perception, sensation, feeling, mood, motivation, behavior, memory, and, learning, the, term, is, sometimes, used, in, a, more, narrow, sense, to, refer, only, to, higher, or, more, abstract, cognitive, functions, associated, with, reasoning, and, awareness, minds, were, traditionally, conceived, as, immaterial, substances, or, independent, entities, and, contrasted, with, matter, and, body, in, the, contemporary, discourse, they, are, more, commonly, seen, as, features, of, other, entities, and, are, often, understood, as, capacities, of, material, brains, the, precise, definition, of, mind, is, disputed, and, while, it, is, generally, accepted, that, some, non, human, animals, also, have, mind, there, is, no, agreement, on, where, exactly, the, boundary, lies, despite, these, disputes, there, is, wide, agreement, that, mind, plays, a, central, role, in, most, aspects, of, human, life, as, the, seat, of, consciousness, emotions, thoughts, and, sense, of, personal, identity, various, fields, of, inquiry, study, the, mind, the, main, ones, include, psychology, cognitive, science, neuroscience, and, philosophy, the, words, psyche, and, mentality, are, usually, used, as, synonyms, of, mind, they, are, often, employed, in, overlapping, ways, with, the, terms, soul, spirit, cognition, intellect, intelligence, and, brain, but, their, meanings, are, not, exactly, the, same, some, religions, understand, the, soul, as, an, independent, entity, that, constitutes, the, immaterial, essence, of, human, beings, is, of, divine, origin, survives, bodily, death, and, is, immortal, the, word, spirit, has, various, additional, meanings, not, directly, associated, with, mind, such, as, a, vital, principle, animating, living, beings, or, a, supernatural, being, inhabiting, objects, or, places, cognition, encompasses, certain, types, of, mental, processes, in, which, knowledge, is, acquired, and, information, processed, the, intellect, is, one, mental, capacity, responsible, for, thought, reasoning, and, understanding, and, is, closely, related, to, intelligence, as, the, ability, to, acquire, understand, and, apply, knowledge, the, brain, is, the, physical, organ, responsible, for, most, or, all, mental, functions, the, modern, english, word, mind, originates, from, the, old, english, word, gemynd, meaning, memory, this, term, gave, rise, to, the, middle, english, words, mind, e, m, nd, e, and, mend, e, resulting, in, a, slow, expansion, of, meaning, to, cover, all, mental, capacities, the, original, meaning, is, preserved, in, expressions, like, call, to, mind, and, keep, in, mind, cognates, include, the, old, high, german, gimunt, the, gothic, gamunds, the, ancient, greek, the, latin, mens, and, the, sanskrit, manas, the, mind, encompasses, many, functions, and, processes, including, perception, memory, thought, imagination, motivation, emotion, attention, learning, and, consciousness, perception, is, the, process, of, interpreting, and, organizing, sensory, information, to, become, acquainted, with, the, environment, this, information, is, acquired, through, sense, organs, receptive, to, various, types, of, physical, stimuli, which, correspond, to, different, forms, of, perception, such, as, vision, sound, touch, smell, and, taste, the, sensory, information, received, this, way, is, a, form, of, raw, data, that, is, filtered, and, processed, to, actively, construct, a, representation, of, the, world, and, the, objects, within, it, this, complex, process, underlying, perceptual, experience, is, shaped, by, many, factors, including, the, individual, s, past, experiences, cultural, background, beliefs, and, expectations, memory, is, the, mechanism, of, storing, and, retrieving, information, episodic, memory, handles, information, about, specific, past, events, in, one, s, life, and, makes, this, information, available, in, the, present, when, a, person, remembers, what, they, had, for, dinner, yesterday, they, employ, episodic, memory, semantic, memory, handles, general, knowledge, about, the, world, that, is, not, tied, to, any, specific, episodes, when, a, person, recalls, that, the, capital, of, japan, is, tokyo, they, usually, access, this, general, information, without, recalling, the, specific, instance, when, they, learned, it, procedural, memory, is, memory, of, how, to, do, things, such, as, riding, a, bicycle, or, playing, a, musical, instrument, another, distinction, is, between, short, term, memory, which, holds, information, for, brief, periods, usually, with, the, purpose, of, completing, specific, cognitive, tasks, and, long, term, memory, which, can, store, information, indefinitely, thinking, involves, the, processing, of, information, and, the, manipulation, of, mental, representations, it, is, a, goal, oriented, activity, that, often, happens, in, response, to, experiences, as, a, symbolic, process, aimed, at, making, sense, of, them, organizing, their, information, and, deciding, how, to, respond, logical, reasoning, is, a, form, of, thinking, that, starts, from, a, set, of, premises, and, aims, to, arrive, at, a, conclusion, supported, by, these, premises, this, is, the, case, when, deducing, that, socrates, is, mortal, from, the, premises, socrates, is, a, man, and, all, men, are, mortal, problem, solving, is, a, closely, related, process, that, consists, of, several, steps, such, as, identifying, a, problem, developing, a, plan, to, address, it, implementing, the, plan, and, assessing, whether, it, worked, thinking, in, the, form, of, decision, making, involves, considering, possible, courses, of, action, to, assess, which, one, is, the, most, beneficial, as, a, symbolic, process, thinking, is, deeply, intertwined, with, language, and, some, theorists, hold, that, all, thought, happens, through, the, medium, of, language, imagination, is, a, creative, process, of, internally, generating, mental, images, unlike, perception, it, does, not, directly, depend, on, the, stimulation, of, sensory, organs, similar, to, dreaming, these, images, are, often, derived, from, previous, experiences, but, can, include, novel, combinations, and, elements, imagination, happens, during, daydreaming, and, plays, a, key, role, in, art, and, literature, but, can, also, be, used, to, come, up, with, novel, solutions, to, real, world, problems, motivation, is, an, internal, state, that, propels, individuals, to, initiate, continue, or, terminate, goal, directed, behavior, it, is, responsible, for, the, formation, of, intentions, to, perform, actions, and, affects, what, goals, someone, pursues, how, much, effort, they, invest, in, the, activity, and, how, long, they, engage, in, it, motivation, is, affected, by, emotions, which, are, temporary, experiences, of, positive, or, negative, feelings, like, joy, or, anger, they, are, directed, at, and, evaluate, specific, events, persons, or, situations, they, usually, come, together, with, certain, physiological, and, behavioral, responses, attention, is, an, aspect, of, other, mental, processes, in, which, mental, resources, like, awareness, are, directed, towards, certain, features, of, experience, and, away, from, others, this, happens, when, a, driver, focuses, on, the, traffic, while, ignoring, billboards, on, the, side, of, the, road, attention, can, be, controlled, voluntarily, in, the, pursuit, of, specific, goals, but, can, also, occur, involuntarily, when, a, strong, stimulus, captures, a, person, s, attention, attention, is, relevant, to, learning, which, is, the, ability, of, the, mind, to, acquire, new, information, and, permanently, modify, its, understanding, and, behavioral, patterns, individuals, learn, by, undergoing, experiences, which, helps, them, adapt, to, the, environment, an, influential, distinction, is, between, conscious, and, unconscious, mental, processes, consciousness, is, the, awareness, of, external, and, internal, circumstances, it, encompasses, a, wide, variety, of, states, such, as, perception, thinking, fantasizing, dreaming, and, altered, states, of, consciousness, in, the, case, of, phenomenal, consciousness, the, awareness, involves, a, direct, and, qualitative, experience, of, mental, phenomena, like, the, auditory, experience, of, attending, a, concert, access, consciousness, by, contrast, refers, to, an, awareness, of, information, that, is, accessible, to, other, mental, processes, but, not, necessarily, part, of, current, experience, for, example, the, information, stored, in, a, memory, may, be, accessible, when, drawing, conclusions, or, guiding, actions, even, when, the, person, is, not, explicitly, thinking, about, it, unconscious, or, nonconscious, mental, processes, operate, without, the, individual, s, awareness, but, can, still, influence, mental, phenomena, on, the, level, of, thought, feeling, and, action, some, theorists, distinguish, between, preconscious, subconscious, and, unconscious, states, depending, on, their, accessibility, to, conscious, awareness, when, applied, to, the, overall, state, of, a, person, rather, than, specific, processes, the, term, unconscious, implies, that, the, person, lacks, any, awareness, of, their, environment, and, themselves, like, during, a, coma, the, unconscious, mind, plays, a, central, role, in, psychoanalysis, as, the, part, of, the, mind, that, contains, thoughts, memories, and, desires, not, accessible, to, conscious, introspection, according, to, sigmund, freud, the, psychological, mechanism, of, repression, keeps, disturbing, phenomena, like, unacceptable, sexual, and, aggressive, impulses, from, entering, consciousness, to, protect, the, individual, psychoanalytic, theory, studies, symptoms, caused, by, this, process, and, therapeutic, methods, to, avoid, them, by, making, the, repressed, thoughts, accessible, to, conscious, awareness, mental, states, are, often, divided, into, sensory, and, propositional, states, sensory, states, are, experiences, of, sensory, qualities, often, referred, to, as, qualia, like, colors, sounds, smells, pains, itches, and, hunger, propositional, states, involve, an, attitude, towards, a, content, that, can, be, expressed, by, a, declarative, sentence, when, a, person, believes, that, it, is, raining, they, have, the, propositional, attitude, of, belief, towards, the, content, it, is, raining, different, types, of, propositional, states, are, characterized, by, different, attitudes, towards, their, content, for, instance, it, is, also, possible, to, hope, fear, desire, or, doubt, that, it, is, raining, a, mental, state, or, process, is, rational, if, it, is, based, on, good, reasons, or, follows, the, norms, of, rationality, for, example, a, belief, is, rational, if, it, relies, on, strong, supporting, evidence, and, a, decision, is, rational, if, it, follows, careful, deliberation, of, all, the, relevant, factors, and, outcomes, mental, states, are, irrational, if, they, are, not, based, on, good, reasons, such, as, beliefs, caused, by, faulty, reasoning, superstition, or, cognitive, biases, and, decisions, that, give, into, temptations, instead, of, following, one, s, best, judgment, mental, states, that, fall, outside, the, domain, of, rational, evaluation, are, arational, rather, than, irrational, there, is, controversy, regarding, which, mental, phenomena, lie, outside, this, domain, suggested, examples, include, sensory, impressions, feelings, desires, and, involuntary, responses, another, contrast, is, between, dispositional, and, occurrent, mental, states, a, dispositional, state, is, a, power, that, is, not, exercised, if, a, person, believes, that, cats, have, whiskers, but, does, not, think, about, this, fact, it, is, a, dispositional, belief, by, activating, the, belief, to, consciously, think, about, it, or, use, it, in, other, cognitive, processes, it, becomes, occurrent, until, it, is, no, longer, actively, considered, or, used, the, great, majority, of, a, person, s, beliefs, are, dispositional, most, of, the, time, traditionally, the, mind, was, subdivided, into, mental, faculties, understood, as, capacities, to, perform, certain, functions, or, bring, about, certain, processes, an, influential, subdivision, in, the, history, of, philosophy, was, between, the, faculties, of, intellect, and, will, the, intellect, encompasses, mental, phenomena, aimed, at, understanding, the, world, and, determining, what, to, believe, or, what, is, true, the, will, has, a, practical, orientation, focused, on, desire, decision, making, action, and, what, is, good, the, exact, number, and, nature, of, the, mental, faculties, are, disputed, and, more, fine, grained, subdivisions, have, been, proposed, such, as, dividing, the, intellect, into, the, faculties, of, understanding, and, judgment, or, adding, sensibility, as, an, additional, faculty, responsible, for, sensory, impressions, in, contrast, to, the, traditional, view, more, recent, approaches, analyze, the, mind, in, terms, of, mental, modules, rather, than, faculties, a, mental, module, is, an, inborn, system, of, the, brain, that, automatically, performs, a, particular, function, within, a, specific, domain, without, conscious, awareness, or, effort, in, contrast, to, faculties, the, concept, of, mental, modules, is, normally, used, to, provide, a, more, limited, explanation, restricted, to, certain, low, level, cognitive, processes, without, trying, to, explain, how, they, are, integrated, into, higher, level, processes, such, as, conscious, reasoning, many, low, level, cognitive, processes, responsible, for, visual, perception, have, this, automatic, and, unconscious, nature, in, the, case, of, visual, illusions, like, the, m, ller, lyer, illusion, the, underlying, processes, continue, their, operation, and, the, illusion, persists, even, after, a, person, has, become, aware, of, the, illusion, indicating, the, mechanical, and, involuntary, nature, of, the, process, other, examples, of, mental, modules, concern, cognitive, processes, responsible, for, language, processing, and, facial, recognition, theories, of, the, nature, of, mind, aim, to, determine, what, all, mental, states, have, in, common, they, seek, to, discover, the, mark, of, the, mental, that, is, the, criteria, that, distinguish, mental, from, non, mental, phenomena, epistemic, criteria, say, that, the, unique, feature, of, mental, states, is, how, people, know, about, them, for, example, if, a, person, has, a, toothache, they, have, direct, or, non, inferential, knowledge, that, they, are, in, pain, but, they, do, not, have, this, kind, of, knowledge, of, the, physical, causes, of, the, pain, and, may, have, to, consult, external, evidence, through, visual, inspection, or, a, visit, to, the, dentist, another, feature, commonly, ascribed, to, mental, states, is, that, they, are, private, meaning, that, others, do, not, have, this, kind, of, direct, access, to, a, person, s, mental, state, and, have, to, infer, it, from, other, observations, like, the, pain, behavior, of, the, person, with, the, toothache, some, philosophers, claim, that, knowledge, of, some, or, all, mental, states, is, infallible, for, instance, that, a, person, cannot, be, mistaken, about, whether, they, are, in, pain, a, related, view, states, that, all, mental, states, are, either, conscious, or, accessible, to, consciousness, according, to, this, view, when, a, person, actively, remembers, the, fact, that, the, eiffel, tower, is, in, paris, then, this, state, is, mental, because, it, is, part, of, consciousness, when, the, person, does, not, think, about, it, this, belief, is, still, a, mental, state, because, the, person, could, bring, it, to, consciousness, by, thinking, about, it, this, view, denies, the, existence, of, a, deep, unconsciousness, that, is, unconscious, mental, states, that, cannot, in, principle, become, conscious, another, theory, says, that, intentionality, is, the, mark, of, the, mental, a, state, is, intentional, if, it, refers, to, or, represents, something, for, example, if, a, person, perceives, a, piano, or, thinks, about, it, then, the, mental, state, is, intentional, because, it, refers, to, a, piano, this, view, distinguishes, between, original, and, derivative, intentionality, mental, states, have, original, intentionality, while, some, non, mental, phenomena, have, derivative, intentionality, for, instance, the, word, piano, and, a, picture, of, a, piano, are, intentional, in, a, derivative, sense, they, do, not, directly, refer, to, a, piano, but, if, a, person, looks, at, them, they, may, evoke, in, this, person, a, mental, state, that, refers, to, a, piano, philosophers, who, disagree, that, all, mental, states, are, intentional, cite, examples, such, as, itches, tickles, and, pains, as, possible, exceptions, according, to, behaviorism, mental, states, are, dispositions, to, engage, in, certain, publicly, observable, behavior, as, a, reaction, to, particular, external, stimuli, this, view, implies, that, mental, phenomena, are, not, private, internal, states, but, are, accessible, to, empirical, observation, like, regular, physical, phenomena, functionalism, agrees, that, mental, states, do, not, depend, on, the, exact, internal, constitution, of, the, mind, and, characterizes, them, instead, in, regard, to, their, functional, role, unlike, behaviorism, this, role, is, not, limited, to, behavioral, patterns, but, includes, other, factors, as, well, for, example, part, of, the, functional, role, of, pain, is, given, by, its, relation, to, bodily, injury, and, its, tendency, to, cause, behavioral, patterns, like, moaning, and, other, mental, states, like, a, desire, to, stop, the, pain, computationalism, a, similar, theory, prominent, in, cognitive, science, defines, minds, in, terms, of, cognitions, and, computations, as, information, processors, theories, under, the, umbrella, of, externalism, emphasize, the, mind, s, dependency, on, the, environment, according, to, this, view, mental, states, and, their, contents, are, at, least, partially, determined, by, external, circumstances, for, example, some, forms, of, content, externalism, hold, that, it, can, depend, on, external, circumstances, whether, a, belief, refers, to, one, object, or, another, the, extended, mind, thesis, states, that, external, circumstances, not, only, affect, the, mind, but, are, part, of, it, like, a, diary, or, a, calculator, extend, the, mind, s, capacity, to, store, and, process, information, the, closely, related, view, of, enactivism, holds, that, mental, processes, involve, an, interaction, between, organism, and, environment, the, mind, body, problem, is, the, difficulty, of, providing, a, general, explanation, of, the, relationship, between, mind, and, body, for, example, of, the, link, between, thoughts, and, brain, processes, despite, their, different, characteristics, mind, and, body, interact, with, each, other, like, when, a, bodily, change, causes, mental, discomfort, or, when, a, limb, moves, because, of, an, intention, according, to, substance, dualism, minds, or, souls, exist, as, distinct, substances, that, have, mental, states, while, material, things, are, another, type, of, substance, this, view, implies, that, at, least, in, principle, minds, can, exist, without, bodies, property, dualism, is, another, form, of, dualism, that, says, that, mind, and, matter, are, not, distinct, individuals, but, different, properties, that, apply, to, the, same, individual, monist, views, by, contrast, state, that, reality, is, made, up, of, only, one, kind, according, to, idealists, everything, is, mental, they, understand, material, things, as, mental, constructs, for, example, as, ideas, or, perceptions, according, to, neutral, monists, the, world, is, at, its, most, fundamental, level, neither, physical, nor, mental, but, neutral, they, see, physical, and, mental, concepts, as, convenient, but, superficial, ways, to, describe, reality, the, monist, view, most, influential, in, contemporary, philosophy, is, physicalism, also, referred, to, as, materialism, which, states, that, everything, is, physical, according, to, eliminative, physicalism, there, are, no, mental, phenomena, meaning, that, things, like, beliefs, and, desires, do, not, form, part, of, reality, reductive, physicalists, defend, a, less, radical, position, they, say, that, mental, states, exist, but, can, at, least, in, principle, be, completely, described, by, physics, without, the, need, for, special, sciences, like, psychology, for, example, behaviorists, aim, to, analyze, mental, concepts, in, terms, of, observable, behavior, without, resorting, to, internal, mental, states, type, identity, theory, also, belongs, to, reductive, physicalism, and, says, that, mental, states, are, the, same, as, brain, states, while, non, reductive, physicalists, agree, that, everything, is, physical, they, say, that, mental, concepts, describe, physical, reality, on, a, more, abstract, level, that, cannot, be, achieved, by, physics, according, to, functionalism, mental, concepts, do, not, describe, the, internal, constitution, of, physical, substances, but, functional, roles, within, a, system, one, consequence, of, this, view, is, that, mind, does, not, depend, on, brains, but, can, also, be, realized, by, other, systems, that, implement, the, corresponding, functional, roles, possibly, also, computers, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, is, a, central, aspect, of, the, mind, body, problem, it, is, the, challenge, of, explaining, how, physical, states, can, give, rise, to, conscious, experience, its, main, difficulty, lies, in, the, subjective, and, qualitative, nature, of, consciousness, which, is, unlike, typical, physical, processes, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, contrasts, with, the, easy, problems, of, explaining, how, certain, aspects, of, consciousness, function, such, as, perception, memory, or, learning, another, approach, to, the, relation, between, mind, and, matter, uses, empirical, observation, to, study, how, the, brain, works, and, which, brain, areas, and, processes, are, associated, with, specific, mental, phenomena, the, brain, is, the, central, organ, of, the, nervous, system, and, is, present, in, all, vertebrates, and, the, majority, of, invertebrates, the, human, brain, is, of, particular, complexity, and, consists, of, 86, billion, neurons, which, communicate, with, one, another, via, synapses, they, form, a, complex, neural, network, and, cognitive, processes, emerge, from, their, electrical, and, chemical, interactions, the, human, brain, is, divided, into, regions, that, are, associated, with, different, functions, the, main, regions, are, the, hindbrain, midbrain, and, forebrain, the, hindbrain, and, the, midbrain, are, responsible, for, many, biological, functions, associated, with, basic, survival, while, higher, mental, functions, ranging, from, thoughts, to, motivation, are, primarily, localized, in, the, forebrain, the, primary, operation, of, many, of, the, main, mental, phenomena, is, located, in, specific, areas, of, the, forebrain, the, prefrontal, cortex, is, responsible, for, executive, functions, such, as, planning, decision, making, problem, solving, and, working, memory, the, role, of, the, sensory, cortex, is, to, process, and, interpret, sensory, information, with, different, subareas, dedicated, to, different, senses, like, the, visual, and, the, auditory, areas, a, central, function, of, the, hippocampus, is, the, formation, and, retrieval, of, long, term, memories, it, belongs, to, the, limbic, system, which, plays, a, key, role, in, the, regulation, of, emotions, through, the, amygdala, the, motor, cortex, is, responsible, for, planning, executing, and, controlling, voluntary, movements, broca, s, area, is, a, separate, region, dedicated, to, speech, production, the, activity, of, the, different, areas, is, additionally, influenced, by, neurotransmitters, which, are, signaling, molecules, that, enhance, or, inhibit, different, types, of, neural, communication, for, example, dopamine, influences, motivation, and, pleasure, while, serotonin, affects, mood, and, appetite, the, close, interrelation, of, brain, processes, and, the, mind, is, seen, by, the, effect, that, physical, changes, of, the, brain, have, on, the, mind, for, instance, the, consumption, of, psychoactive, drugs, like, caffeine, antidepressants, alcohol, and, psychedelics, temporarily, affects, brain, chemistry, with, diverse, effects, on, the, mind, ranging, from, increased, attention, to, mood, changes, impaired, cognitive, functions, and, hallucinations, long, term, changes, to, the, brain, in, the, form, of, neurodegenerative, diseases, and, brain, injuries, can, lead, to, permanent, alterations, in, mental, functions, alzheimer, s, disease, in, its, first, stage, deteriorates, the, hippocampus, reducing, the, ability, to, form, new, memories, and, recall, existing, ones, an, often, cited, case, of, the, effects, of, brain, injury, is, phineas, gage, whose, prefrontal, cortex, was, severely, damaged, during, a, work, accident, when, an, iron, rod, pierced, through, his, skull, and, brain, gage, survived, the, accident, but, his, personality, and, social, attitude, changed, significantly, as, he, became, more, impulsive, irritable, and, anti, social, while, showing, little, regard, for, social, conventions, and, an, impaired, ability, to, plan, and, make, rational, decisions, not, all, these, changes, were, permanent, and, gage, managed, to, recover, and, adapt, in, some, areas, the, mind, has, a, long, evolutionary, history, starting, with, the, development, of, the, nervous, system, and, the, brain, while, it, is, generally, accepted, today, that, mind, is, not, exclusive, to, humans, and, various, non, human, animals, have, some, form, of, mind, there, is, no, consensus, at, which, point, exactly, the, mind, emerged, the, evolution, of, mind, is, usually, explained, in, terms, of, natural, selection, genetic, variations, responsible, for, new, or, improved, mental, capacities, like, better, perception, or, social, dispositions, have, an, increased, chance, of, being, passed, on, to, future, generations, if, they, are, beneficial, to, survival, and, reproduction, minimal, forms, of, information, processing, are, already, found, in, the, earliest, forms, of, life, 4, to, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, like, the, abilities, of, bacteria, and, eukaryotic, unicellular, organisms, to, sense, the, environment, store, this, information, and, react, to, it, nerve, cells, emerged, with, the, development, of, multicellular, organisms, more, than, 600, million, years, ago, as, a, way, to, process, and, transmit, information, about, 600, to, 550, million, years, ago, an, evolutionary, bifurcation, happened, into, radially, symmetric, organisms, with, ring, shaped, nervous, systems, or, a, nerve, net, like, jellyfish, and, organisms, with, bilaterally, symmetric, bodies, whose, nervous, systems, tend, to, be, more, centralized, about, 540, million, years, ago, the, bilaterally, organized, organisms, separated, into, invertebrates, and, vertebrates, all, vertebrates, like, birds, and, mammals, have, a, central, nervous, system, including, a, complex, brain, with, specialized, functions, while, invertebrates, like, clams, and, insects, either, have, no, brains, or, tend, to, have, simple, brains, with, the, evolution, of, vertebrates, their, brains, tended, to, grow, and, the, specialization, of, the, different, brain, areas, tended, to, increase, these, developments, are, closely, related, to, changes, in, limb, structures, sense, organs, and, living, conditions, with, a, close, correspondence, between, the, size, of, a, brain, area, and, the, importance, of, its, function, to, the, organism, an, important, step, in, the, evolution, of, mammals, about, 200, million, years, ago, was, the, development, of, the, neocortex, which, is, responsible, for, many, higher, order, brain, functions, the, size, of, the, brain, relative, to, the, body, further, increased, with, the, development, of, primates, like, monkeys, about, 65, million, years, ago, and, later, with, the, emergence, of, the, first, hominins, about, 7, 5, million, years, ago, anatomically, modern, humans, appeared, about, 300, 000, to, 200, 000, years, ago, various, theories, of, the, evolutionary, processes, responsible, for, human, intelligence, have, been, proposed, the, social, intelligence, hypothesis, says, that, the, evolution, of, the, human, mind, was, triggered, by, the, increased, importance, of, social, life, and, its, emphasis, on, mental, abilities, associated, with, empathy, knowledge, transfer, and, meta, cognition, according, to, the, ecological, intelligence, hypothesis, the, main, value, of, the, increased, mental, capacities, comes, from, their, advantages, in, dealing, with, a, complex, physical, environment, through, processes, like, behavioral, flexibility, learning, and, tool, use, other, suggested, mechanisms, include, the, effects, of, a, changed, diet, with, energy, rich, food, and, general, benefits, from, an, increased, speed, and, efficiency, of, information, processing, besides, the, development, of, mind, in, general, in, the, course, of, history, there, is, also, the, development, of, individual, human, minds, some, of, the, individual, changes, vary, from, person, to, person, as, a, form, of, learning, from, experience, like, forming, specific, memories, or, acquiring, particular, behavioral, patterns, others, are, more, universal, developments, as, psychological, stages, that, all, or, most, humans, go, through, as, they, pass, through, early, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and, old, age, these, developments, cover, various, areas, including, intellectual, sensorimotor, linguistic, emotional, social, and, moral, developments, some, factors, affect, the, development, of, mind, before, birth, such, as, nutrition, maternal, stress, and, exposure, to, harmful, substances, like, alcohol, during, pregnancy, early, childhood, is, marked, by, rapid, developments, as, infants, learn, voluntary, control, over, their, bodies, and, interact, with, their, environment, on, a, basic, level, typically, after, about, one, year, this, covers, abilities, like, walking, recognizing, familiar, faces, and, producing, individual, words, on, the, emotional, and, social, levels, they, develop, attachments, with, their, primary, caretakers, and, express, emotions, ranging, from, joy, to, anger, fear, and, surprise, an, influential, theory, by, jean, piaget, divides, the, cognitive, development, of, children, into, four, stages, the, sensorimotor, stage, from, birth, until, two, years, is, concerned, with, sensory, impressions, and, motor, activities, while, learning, that, objects, remain, in, existence, even, when, not, observed, in, the, preoperational, stage, until, seven, years, children, learn, to, interpret, and, use, symbols, in, an, intuitive, manner, they, start, employing, logical, reasoning, to, physical, objects, in, the, concrete, operational, stage, until, eleven, years, and, extend, this, capacity, in, the, following, formal, operational, stage, to, abstract, ideas, as, well, as, probabilities, and, possibilities, other, important, processes, shaping, the, mind, in, this, period, are, socialization, and, enculturation, at, first, through, primary, caretakers, and, later, through, peers, and, the, schooling, system, psychological, changes, during, adolescence, are, provoked, both, by, physiological, changes, and, being, confronted, with, a, different, social, situation, and, new, expectations, from, others, an, important, factor, in, this, period, is, change, to, the, self, concept, which, can, take, the, form, of, an, identity, crisis, this, process, often, involves, developing, individuality, and, independence, from, parents, while, at, the, same, time, seeking, closeness, and, conformity, with, friends, and, peers, further, developments, in, this, period, include, improvements, to, the, reasoning, ability, and, the, formation, of, a, principled, moral, viewpoint, the, mind, also, changes, during, adulthood, but, in, a, less, rapid, and, pronounced, manner, reasoning, and, problem, solving, skills, improve, during, early, and, middle, adulthood, some, people, experience, the, mid, life, transition, as, a, midlife, crisis, involving, an, inner, conflict, about, personal, identity, often, associated, with, anxiety, a, sense, of, lack, of, accomplishments, in, life, and, an, awareness, of, mortality, intellectual, faculties, tend, to, decline, in, later, adulthood, specifically, the, ability, to, learn, complex, unfamiliar, tasks, and, later, also, the, ability, to, remember, while, people, tend, to, become, more, inward, looking, and, cautious, it, is, commonly, acknowledged, today, that, animals, have, some, form, of, mind, but, it, is, controversial, to, which, animals, this, applies, and, how, their, mind, differs, from, the, human, mind, different, conceptions, of, the, mind, lead, to, different, responses, to, this, problem, when, understood, in, a, very, wide, sense, as, the, capacity, to, process, information, the, mind, is, present, in, all, forms, of, life, including, insects, plants, and, individual, cells, on, the, other, side, of, the, spectrum, are, views, that, deny, the, existence, of, mentality, in, most, or, all, non, human, animals, based, on, the, idea, that, they, lack, key, mental, capacities, like, abstract, rationality, and, symbolic, language, the, status, of, animal, minds, is, highly, relevant, to, the, field, of, ethics, since, it, affects, the, treatment, of, animals, including, the, topic, of, animal, rights, discontinuity, views, state, that, the, minds, of, non, human, animals, are, fundamentally, different, from, human, minds, and, often, point, to, higher, mental, faculties, like, thinking, reasoning, and, decision, making, based, on, beliefs, and, desires, this, outlook, is, reflected, in, the, traditionally, influential, position, of, defining, humans, as, rational, animals, as, opposed, to, all, other, animals, continuity, views, by, contrast, emphasize, similarities, and, see, the, increased, human, mental, capacities, as, a, matter, of, degree, rather, than, kind, central, considerations, for, this, position, are, the, shared, evolutionary, origin, organic, similarities, on, the, level, of, brain, and, nervous, system, and, observable, behavior, ranging, from, problem, solving, skills, animal, communication, and, reactions, to, and, expressions, of, pain, and, pleasure, of, particular, importance, are, the, questions, of, consciousness, and, sentience, that, is, to, what, extent, non, human, animals, have, a, subjective, experience, of, the, world, and, are, capable, of, suffering, and, feeling, joy, some, of, the, difficulties, of, assessing, animal, minds, are, also, reflected, in, the, topic, of, artificial, minds, that, is, the, question, of, whether, computer, systems, implementing, artificial, intelligence, should, be, considered, a, form, of, mind, this, idea, is, consistent, with, some, theories, of, the, nature, of, mind, such, as, functionalism, and, its, idea, that, mental, concepts, describe, functional, roles, which, are, implemented, by, biological, brains, but, could, in, principle, also, be, implemented, by, artificial, devices, the, turing, test, is, a, traditionally, influential, procedure, to, test, artificial, intelligence, a, person, exchanges, messages, with, two, parties, one, of, them, a, human, and, the, other, a, computer, the, computer, passes, the, test, if, it, is, not, possible, to, reliably, tell, which, party, is, the, human, and, which, one, is, the, computer, while, there, are, computer, programs, today, that, may, pass, the, turing, test, this, alone, is, usually, not, accepted, as, conclusive, proof, of, mindedness, for, other, aspects, of, mind, it, is, more, controversial, whether, computers, can, in, principle, implement, them, such, as, desires, feelings, consciousness, and, free, will, this, problem, is, often, discussed, through, the, contrast, between, weak, and, strong, artificial, intelligence, weak, or, narrow, artificial, intelligence, is, limited, to, specific, mental, capacities, or, functions, it, focuses, on, a, particular, task, or, a, narrow, set, of, tasks, like, autonomous, driving, speech, recognition, or, theorem, proving, the, goal, of, strong, ai, also, termed, artificial, general, intelligence, is, to, create, a, complete, artificial, person, that, has, all, the, mental, capacities, of, humans, including, consciousness, emotion, and, reason, it, is, controversial, whether, strong, ai, is, possible, influential, arguments, against, it, include, john, searle, s, chinese, room, argument, and, hubert, dreyfus, s, critique, based, on, heideggerian, philosophy, mental, health, is, a, state, of, mind, characterized, by, internal, equilibrium, and, well, being, in, which, mental, capacities, function, as, they, should, some, theorists, emphasize, positive, features, such, as, the, abilities, of, a, person, to, realize, their, potential, express, and, modulate, emotions, cope, with, adverse, life, situations, and, fulfill, their, social, role, negative, definitions, by, contrast, see, mental, health, as, the, absence, of, mental, illness, in, the, form, of, mental, disorders, mental, disorders, are, abnormal, patterns, of, thought, emotion, or, behavior, that, deviate, not, only, from, how, a, mental, capacity, works, on, average, but, from, the, norm, of, how, it, should, work, while, usually, causing, some, form, of, distress, the, content, of, those, norms, is, controversial, and, there, are, differences, from, culture, to, culture, for, example, homosexuality, was, historically, considered, a, mental, disorder, by, medical, professionals, a, view, which, only, changed, in, the, late, 20th, century, there, is, a, great, variety, of, mental, disorders, each, associated, with, a, different, form, of, malfunctioning, anxiety, disorders, involve, intense, and, persistent, fear, that, is, disproportionate, to, the, actual, threat, and, significantly, impairs, everyday, life, like, social, phobias, which, involve, irrational, fear, of, certain, social, situations, anxiety, disorders, also, include, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, for, which, the, anxiety, manifests, in, the, form, of, intrusive, thoughts, that, the, person, tries, to, alleviate, by, following, compulsive, rituals, mood, disorders, cause, intensive, moods, or, mood, swings, that, are, inconsistent, with, the, external, circumstances, and, can, last, for, extensive, periods, for, instance, people, affected, by, bipolar, disorder, experience, extreme, mood, swings, between, manic, states, of, euphoria, and, depressive, states, of, hopelessness, personality, disorders, are, characterized, by, enduring, patterns, of, maladaptive, behavior, that, significantly, impair, regular, life, like, paranoid, personality, disorder, which, leads, people, to, be, deeply, suspicious, of, the, motives, of, others, without, rational, basis, psychotic, disorders, are, among, the, most, severe, mental, illnesses, and, involve, a, distorted, relation, to, reality, in, the, form, of, hallucinations, and, delusions, as, seen, in, schizophrenia, other, disorders, include, dissociative, disorders, and, eating, disorders, there, are, different, approaches, to, treating, mental, disorders, and, the, most, appropriate, treatment, usually, depends, on, factors, like, the, type, of, disorder, its, cause, and, the, person, s, general, condition, psychotherapeutic, methods, use, personal, interaction, with, a, therapist, to, understand, the, disorder, and, help, the, patient, change, their, patterns, of, thinking, feeling, and, acting, psychoanalysis, conceives, the, source, of, mental, disorders, as, a, conflict, between, the, conscious, and, the, unconscious, mind, the, therapeutic, aim, is, to, gain, insight, into, unconscious, conflicts, to, resolve, them, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, also, focuses, on, insight, but, gives, more, emphasis, to, conscious, mental, phenomena, to, identify, and, change, irrational, beliefs, and, negative, thought, patterns, behavior, therapy, is, a, related, approach, that, relies, on, classical, conditioning, to, unlearn, harmful, behaviors, rather, than, alter, thought, patterns, humanistic, therapies, try, to, help, people, gain, insight, into, their, self, worth, and, empower, them, to, resolve, their, problems, and, discover, their, potential, drug, therapies, use, medication, to, alter, the, brain, chemistry, involved, in, the, disorder, through, substances, like, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood, stabilizers, and, anxiolytics, they, fall, into, the, domain, of, psychiatry, and, are, sometimes, used, in, combination, with, psychotherapeutic, methods, various, fields, of, inquiry, study, the, mind, including, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and, cognitive, science, they, differ, from, each, other, in, the, aspects, of, mind, they, investigate, and, the, methods, they, employ, in, the, process, the, study, of, the, mind, poses, various, problems, since, it, is, difficult, to, directly, examine, manipulate, and, measure, it, trying, to, circumvent, this, problem, by, investigating, the, brain, comes, with, new, challenges, of, its, own, mainly, because, of, the, brain, s, complexity, as, a, neural, network, consisting, of, billions, of, neurons, each, with, up, to, 10, 000, links, to, other, neurons, psychology, is, the, scientific, study, of, mind, and, behavior, it, investigates, conscious, and, unconscious, mental, phenomena, including, perception, memory, feeling, thought, decision, intelligence, and, personality, it, is, further, interested, in, their, outward, manifestation, in, the, form, of, observable, behavioral, patterns, and, how, these, patterns, depend, on, external, circumstances, and, are, shaped, by, learning, psychology, is, a, wide, discipline, that, includes, many, subfields, cognitive, psychology, is, interested, in, higher, order, mental, activities, like, thinking, problem, solving, reasoning, and, concept, formation, biological, psychology, seeks, to, understand, the, underlying, mechanisms, on, the, physiological, level, and, how, they, depend, on, genetic, transmission, and, the, environment, developmental, psychology, studies, the, development, of, the, mind, from, childhood, to, old, age, while, social, psychology, examines, the, influence, of, social, contexts, on, mind, and, behavior, further, subfields, include, comparative, clinical, educational, occupational, and, neuropsychology, psychologists, use, a, great, variety, of, methods, to, study, the, mind, experimental, approaches, set, up, a, controlled, situation, either, in, the, laboratory, or, the, field, in, which, they, modify, independent, variables, and, measure, their, effects, on, dependent, variables, this, approach, makes, it, possible, to, identify, causal, relations, between, the, variables, for, example, to, determine, whether, people, with, similar, interests, independent, variable, are, more, likely, to, become, friends, dependent, variables, participants, of, a, study, could, be, paired, with, either, similar, or, dissimilar, participants, after, giving, the, pairs, time, to, interact, it, is, assessed, whether, the, members, of, similar, pairs, have, more, positive, attitudes, toward, one, another, than, the, members, of, dissimilar, pairs, correlational, methods, examine, the, strength, of, association, between, two, variables, without, establishing, a, causal, relationship, between, them, the, survey, method, presents, participants, with, a, list, of, questions, aimed, at, eliciting, information, about, their, mental, attitudes, behavior, and, other, relevant, factors, it, analyzes, how, participants, respond, to, questions, and, how, answers, to, different, questions, correlate, with, one, another, surveys, usually, have, a, large, number, of, participants, in, contrast, to, case, studies, which, focus, on, an, in, depth, examination, of, a, single, subject, or, a, small, group, of, subjects, often, to, examine, rare, phenomena, or, explore, new, fields, further, methods, include, longitudinal, studies, naturalistic, observation, and, phenomenological, description, of, experience, neuroscience, is, the, study, of, the, nervous, system, its, primary, focus, is, the, central, nervous, system, and, the, brain, in, particular, but, it, also, investigates, the, peripheral, nervous, system, mainly, responsible, for, connecting, the, central, nervous, system, to, the, limbs, and, organs, neuroscience, examines, the, implementation, of, mental, phenomena, on, a, physiological, basis, it, covers, various, levels, of, analysis, on, the, small, scale, it, studies, the, molecular, and, cellular, basis, of, the, mind, dealing, with, the, constitution, of, and, interaction, between, individual, neurons, on, the, large, scale, it, analyzes, the, architecture, of, the, brain, as, a, whole, and, its, division, into, regions, with, different, functions, neuroimaging, techniques, are, of, particular, importance, as, the, main, research, methods, of, neuroscientists, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, measures, changes, in, the, magnetic, field, of, the, brain, associated, with, blood, flow, areas, of, increased, blood, flow, indicate, that, the, corresponding, brain, region, is, particularly, active, positron, emission, tomography, pet, uses, radioactive, substances, to, detect, a, range, of, metabolic, changes, in, the, brain, electroencephalography, eeg, measures, the, electrical, activity, of, the, brain, usually, by, placing, electrodes, on, the, scalp, and, measuring, the, voltage, differences, between, them, these, techniques, are, often, employed, to, measure, brain, changes, under, particular, circumstances, for, example, while, engaged, in, a, specific, cognitive, task, important, insights, are, also, gained, from, patients, and, laboratory, animals, with, brain, damage, in, particular, areas, to, assess, the, function, of, the, damaged, area, and, how, its, absence, affects, the, remaining, brain, philosophy, of, mind, examines, the, nature, of, mental, phenomena, and, their, relation, to, the, physical, world, it, seeks, to, understand, the, mark, of, the, mental, that, is, the, features, that, all, mental, states, have, in, common, it, further, investigates, the, essence, of, different, types, of, mental, phenomena, such, as, beliefs, desires, emotions, intentionality, and, consciousness, while, exploring, how, they, are, related, to, one, another, philosophy, of, mind, also, examines, solutions, to, the, mind, body, problem, like, dualism, idealism, and, physicalism, and, assesses, arguments, for, and, against, them, further, topics, are, personal, identity, and, free, will, while, philosophers, of, mind, also, include, empirical, considerations, in, their, inquiry, they, differ, from, fields, like, psychology, and, neuroscience, by, giving, significantly, more, emphasis, to, non, empirical, forms, of, inquiry, one, such, method, is, conceptual, analysis, which, aims, to, clarify, the, meaning, of, concepts, like, mind, and, intention, by, decomposing, them, to, identify, their, semantic, parts, thought, experiments, are, often, used, to, evoke, intuitions, about, abstract, theories, to, assess, their, coherence, and, plausibility, philosophers, imagine, a, situation, relevant, to, a, theory, and, employ, counterfactual, thinking, to, assess, the, possible, consequences, of, this, theory, as, in, mary, the, color, scientist, philosophical, zombies, and, brain, in, a, vat, scenarios, because, of, the, subjective, nature, of, the, mind, the, phenomenological, method, is, also, commonly, used, to, analyze, the, structure, of, consciousness, by, describing, experience, from, the, first, person, perspective, cognitive, science, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, mental, processes, it, aims, to, overcome, the, challenge, of, understanding, something, as, complex, as, the, mind, by, integrating, research, from, diverse, fields, ranging, from, psychology, and, neuroscience, to, philosophy, linguistics, and, artificial, intelligence, unlike, these, disciplines, it, is, not, a, unified, field, but, a, collaborative, effort, one, difficulty, in, synthesizing, their, insights, is, that, each, of, these, disciplines, explores, the, mind, from, a, different, perspective, and, level, of, abstraction, while, using, different, research, methods, to, arrive, at, its, conclusion, cognitive, science, aims, to, overcome, this, difficulty, by, relying, on, a, unified, conceptualization, of, minds, as, information, processors, this, means, that, mental, processes, are, understood, as, computations, that, retrieve, transform, store, and, transmit, information, for, example, perception, retrieves, sensory, information, from, the, environment, and, transforms, it, to, extract, meaningful, patterns, that, can, be, used, in, other, mental, processes, such, as, planning, and, decision, making, cognitive, science, relies, on, different, levels, of, description, to, analyze, cognitive, processes, the, most, abstract, level, focuses, on, the, basic, problem, the, process, is, supposed, to, solve, and, the, reasons, why, the, organism, needs, to, solve, it, the, intermediate, level, seeks, to, uncover, the, algorithm, as, a, formal, step, by, step, procedure, to, solve, the, problem, the, most, concrete, level, asks, how, the, algorithm, is, implemented, through, physiological, changes, on, the, level, of, the, brain, another, methodology, to, deal, with, the, complexity, of, the, mind, is, to, analyze, the, mind, as, a, complex, system, composed, of, individual, subsystems, that, can, be, studied, independently, of, one, another, the, mind, is, relevant, to, many, fields, in, epistemology, the, problem, of, other, minds, is, the, challenge, of, explaining, how, it, is, possible, to, know, that, people, other, than, oneself, have, a, mind, the, difficulty, arises, from, the, fact, that, people, directly, experience, their, own, minds, but, do, not, have, the, same, access, to, the, minds, of, others, according, to, a, common, view, it, is, necessary, to, rely, on, perception, to, observe, the, behavior, of, others, and, then, infer, that, they, have, a, mind, based, on, analogical, or, abductive, reasoning, closely, related, to, this, problem, is, theory, of, mind, in, psychology, which, is, the, ability, to, understand, that, other, people, possess, beliefs, desires, intentions, and, feelings, that, may, differ, from, one, s, own, anthropology, is, interested, in, how, different, cultures, conceptualize, the, nature, of, mind, and, its, relation, to, the, world, these, conceptualizations, affect, the, way, people, understand, themselves, experience, illness, and, interpret, ritualistic, practices, as, attempts, to, commune, with, spirits, some, cultures, do, not, draw, a, strict, boundary, between, mind, and, world, by, allowing, that, thoughts, can, pass, directly, into, the, world, and, manifest, as, beneficial, or, harmful, forces, others, strictly, separate, the, mind, as, an, internal, phenomenon, without, supernatural, powers, from, external, reality, sociology, is, a, related, field, concerned, with, the, connections, between, mind, society, and, behavior, the, concept, of, mind, plays, a, central, role, in, various, religions, buddhists, say, that, there, is, no, enduring, self, underlying, mental, activity, and, analyze, the, mind, as, a, stream, of, constantly, changing, experiences, characterized, by, five, aspects, or, aggregates, material, form, feelings, perception, volition, and, consciousness, hindus, by, contrast, affirm, the, existence, of, a, permanent, self, in, an, influential, analogy, the, human, mind, is, compared, to, a, horse, drawn, chariot, the, horses, are, the, senses, which, lure, the, sense, mind, corresponding, to, the, reins, through, sensual, pleasures, but, are, controlled, by, the, charioteer, embodying, the, intellect, while, the, self, is, a, passenger, in, traditional, christian, philosophy, mind, and, soul, are, closely, intertwined, as, the, immaterial, aspect, of, humans, that, may, survive, bodily, death, islamic, thought, distinguishes, between, the, mind, spirit, heart, and, self, as, interconnected, aspects, of, the, spiritual, dimension, of, humans, daoism, and, confucianism, use, the, concept, of, heart, mind, as, the, center, of, cognitive, and, emotional, life, encompassing, thought, understanding, will, desire, and, mood, in, the, field, of, education, the, minds, of, students, are, shaped, through, the, transmission, of, knowledge, skills, and, character, traits, as, a, process, of, socialization, and, enculturation, this, is, achieved, through, different, teaching, methods, including, the, contrast, between, group, work, and, individual, learning, and, the, use, of, instructional, media, teacher, centered, education, positions, the, teacher, as, the, central, authority, controlling, the, learning, process, whereas, in, student, centered, education, students, have, a, more, active, role, in, shaping, classroom, activities, the, choice, of, the, most, effective, method, to, develop, the, minds, of, the, learners, is, determined, by, various, factors, including, the, topic, and, the, learner, s, age, and, skill, level, the, mind, is, a, frequent, subject, of, pseudoscientific, inquiry, phrenology, was, an, early, attempt, to, correlate, mental, functions, with, specific, brain, areas, while, its, central, claims, about, predicting, mental, traits, by, measuring, bumps, on, the, skull, did, not, survive, scientific, scrutiny, the, underlying, idea, that, certain, mental, functions, are, localized, in, particular, regions, of, the, brain, is, now, widely, accepted, parapsychologists, seek, to, discover, and, study, paranormal, mental, abilities, ranging, from, clairvoyance, to, telepathy, and, telekinesis
