in, grammar, a, noun, is, a, word, that, represents, a, concrete, or, abstract, thing, such, as, living, creatures, places, actions, qualities, states, of, existence, and, ideas, a, noun, may, serve, as, an, object, or, subject, within, a, phrase, clause, or, sentence, in, linguistics, nouns, constitute, a, lexical, category, part, of, speech, defined, according, to, how, its, members, combine, with, members, of, other, lexical, categories, the, syntactic, occurrence, of, nouns, differs, among, languages, in, english, prototypical, nouns, are, common, nouns, or, proper, nouns, that, can, occur, with, determiners, articles, and, attributive, adjectives, and, can, function, as, the, head, of, a, noun, phrase, according, to, traditional, and, popular, classification, pronouns, are, distinct, from, nouns, but, in, much, modern, theory, they, are, considered, a, subclass, of, nouns, every, language, has, various, linguistic, and, grammatical, distinctions, between, nouns, and, verbs, word, classes, parts, of, speech, were, described, by, sanskrit, grammarians, from, at, least, the, 5th, century, bc, in, y, ska, s, nirukta, the, noun, n, ma, is, one, of, the, four, main, categories, of, words, defined, the, ancient, greek, equivalent, was, noma, referred, to, by, plato, in, the, cratylus, dialog, and, later, listed, as, one, of, the, eight, parts, of, speech, in, the, art, of, grammar, attributed, to, dionysius, thrax, 2nd, century, bc, the, term, used, in, latin, grammar, was, n, men, all, of, these, terms, for, noun, were, also, words, meaning, name, the, english, word, noun, is, derived, from, the, latin, term, through, the, anglo, norman, nom, other, forms, include, nomme, and, noun, itself, the, word, classes, were, defined, partly, by, the, grammatical, forms, that, they, take, in, sanskrit, greek, and, latin, for, example, nouns, are, categorized, by, gender, and, inflected, for, case, and, number, because, adjectives, share, these, three, grammatical, categories, adjectives, typically, were, placed, in, the, same, class, as, nouns, similarly, the, latin, term, n, men, includes, both, nouns, substantives, and, adjectives, as, originally, did, the, english, word, noun, the, two, types, being, distinguished, as, nouns, substantive, and, nouns, adjective, or, substantive, nouns, and, adjective, nouns, or, simply, substantives, and, adjectives, the, word, nominal, is, now, sometimes, used, to, denote, a, class, that, includes, both, nouns, and, adjectives, many, european, languages, use, a, cognate, of, the, word, substantive, as, the, basic, term, for, noun, for, example, spanish, sustantivo, noun, nouns, in, the, dictionaries, of, such, languages, are, demarked, by, the, abbreviation, s, or, sb, instead, of, n, which, may, be, used, for, proper, nouns, or, neuter, nouns, instead, in, english, some, modern, authors, use, the, word, substantive, to, refer, to, a, class, that, includes, both, nouns, single, words, and, noun, phrases, multiword, units, that, are, sometimes, called, noun, equivalents, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, counterpart, to, attributive, when, distinguishing, between, a, noun, being, used, as, the, head, main, word, of, a, noun, phrase, and, a, noun, being, used, as, a, noun, adjunct, for, example, the, noun, knee, can, be, said, to, be, used, substantively, in, my, knee, hurts, but, attributively, in, the, patient, needed, knee, replacement, a, noun, can, co, occur, with, an, article, or, an, attributive, adjective, verbs, and, adjectives, cannot, in, the, following, an, asterisk, in, front, of, an, example, means, that, this, example, is, ungrammatical, nouns, have, sometimes, been, characterized, in, terms, of, the, grammatical, categories, by, which, they, may, be, varied, for, example, gender, case, and, number, such, definitions, tend, to, be, language, specific, since, different, languages, may, apply, different, categories, nouns, are, frequently, defined, particularly, in, informal, contexts, in, terms, of, their, semantic, properties, their, meanings, nouns, are, described, as, words, that, refer, to, a, person, place, thing, event, substance, quality, quantity, etc, but, this, manner, of, definition, has, been, criticized, as, uninformative, several, english, nouns, lack, an, intrinsic, referent, of, their, own, behalf, as, in, on, behalf, of, dint, by, dint, of, and, sake, for, the, sake, of, moreover, other, parts, of, speech, may, have, reference, like, properties, the, verbs, to, rain, or, to, mother, or, adjectives, like, red, and, there, is, little, difference, between, the, adverb, gleefully, and, the, prepositional, phrase, with, glee, a, functional, approach, defines, a, noun, as, a, word, that, can, be, the, head, of, a, nominal, phrase, i, e, a, phrase, with, referential, function, without, needing, to, go, through, morphological, transformation, nouns, can, have, a, number, of, different, properties, and, are, often, sub, categorized, based, on, various, of, these, criteria, depending, on, their, occurrence, in, a, language, nouns, may, be, classified, according, to, morphological, properties, such, as, which, prefixes, or, suffixes, they, take, and, also, their, relations, in, syntax, how, they, combine, with, other, words, and, expressions, of, various, types, many, such, classifications, are, language, specific, given, the, obvious, differences, in, syntax, and, morphology, in, english, for, example, it, might, be, noted, that, nouns, are, words, that, can, co, occur, with, definite, articles, as, stated, at, the, start, of, this, article, but, this, could, not, apply, in, russian, which, has, no, definite, articles, in, some, languages, common, and, proper, nouns, have, grammatical, gender, typically, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, the, gender, of, a, noun, as, well, as, its, number, and, case, where, applicable, will, often, require, agreement, in, words, that, modify, or, are, used, along, with, it, in, french, for, example, the, singular, form, of, the, definite, article, is, le, for, masculine, nouns, and, la, for, feminine, adjectives, and, certain, verb, forms, also, change, sometimes, with, the, simple, addition, of, e, for, feminine, grammatical, gender, often, correlates, with, the, form, of, the, noun, and, the, inflection, pattern, it, follows, for, example, in, both, italian, and, romanian, most, nouns, ending, in, a, are, feminine, gender, can, also, correlate, with, the, sex, or, social, gender, of, the, noun, s, referent, particularly, in, the, case, of, nouns, denoting, people, and, sometimes, animals, though, with, exceptions, the, feminine, french, noun, personne, can, refer, to, a, male, or, a, female, person, in, modern, english, even, common, nouns, like, hen, and, princess, and, proper, nouns, like, alicia, do, not, have, grammatical, gender, their, femininity, has, no, relevance, in, syntax, though, they, denote, persons, or, animals, of, a, specific, sex, the, gender, of, a, pronoun, must, be, appropriate, for, the, item, referred, to, the, girl, said, the, ring, was, from, her, new, boyfriend, but, he, denied, it, was, from, him, three, nouns, and, three, gendered, pronouns, or, four, if, this, her, is, counted, as, a, possessive, pronoun, a, proper, noun, sometimes, called, a, proper, name, though, the, two, terms, normally, have, different, meanings, is, a, noun, that, represents, a, unique, entity, india, pegasus, jupiter, confucius, pequod, as, distinguished, from, common, nouns, or, appellative, nouns, which, describe, a, class, of, entities, country, animal, planet, person, ship, in, modern, english, most, proper, nouns, unlike, most, common, nouns, are, capitalized, regardless, of, context, albania, newton, pasteur, america, as, are, many, of, the, forms, that, are, derived, from, them, the, common, noun, in, he, s, an, albanian, the, adjectival, forms, in, he, s, of, albanian, heritage, and, newtonian, physics, but, not, in, pasteurized, milk, the, second, verb, in, they, sought, to, americanize, us, count, nouns, or, countable, nouns, are, common, nouns, that, can, take, a, plural, can, combine, with, numerals, or, counting, quantifiers, e, g, one, two, several, every, most, and, can, take, an, indefinite, article, such, as, a, or, an, in, languages, that, have, such, articles, examples, of, count, nouns, are, chair, nose, and, occasion, mass, nouns, or, uncountable, non, count, nouns, differ, from, count, nouns, in, precisely, that, respect, they, cannot, take, plurals, or, combine, with, number, words, or, the, above, type, of, quantifiers, for, example, the, forms, a, furniture, and, three, furnitures, are, not, used, even, though, pieces, of, furniture, can, be, counted, the, distinction, between, mass, and, count, nouns, does, not, primarily, concern, their, corresponding, referents, but, more, how, the, nouns, present, those, entities, many, nouns, have, both, countable, and, uncountable, uses, for, example, soda, is, countable, in, give, me, three, sodas, but, uncountable, in, he, likes, soda, collective, nouns, are, nouns, that, even, when, they, are, treated, in, their, morphology, and, syntax, as, singular, refer, to, groups, consisting, of, more, than, one, individual, or, entity, examples, include, committee, government, and, police, in, english, these, nouns, may, be, followed, by, a, singular, or, a, plural, verb, and, referred, to, by, a, singular, or, plural, pronoun, the, singular, being, generally, preferred, when, referring, to, the, body, as, a, unit, and, the, plural, often, being, preferred, especially, in, british, english, when, emphasizing, the, individual, members, examples, of, acceptable, and, unacceptable, use, given, by, gowers, in, plain, words, include, concrete, nouns, refer, to, physical, entities, that, can, in, principle, at, least, be, observed, by, at, least, one, of, the, senses, chair, apple, janet, atom, as, items, supposed, to, exist, in, the, physical, world, abstract, nouns, on, the, other, hand, refer, to, abstract, objects, ideas, or, concepts, justice, anger, solubility, duration, some, nouns, have, both, concrete, and, abstract, meanings, art, usually, refers, to, something, abstract, art, is, important, in, human, culture, but, it, can, also, refer, to, a, concrete, item, i, put, my, daughter, s, art, up, on, the, fridge, a, noun, might, have, a, literal, concrete, and, also, a, figurative, abstract, meaning, a, brass, key, and, the, key, to, success, a, block, in, the, pipe, and, a, mental, block, similarly, some, abstract, nouns, have, developed, etymologically, by, figurative, extension, from, literal, roots, drawback, fraction, holdout, uptake, many, abstract, nouns, in, english, are, formed, by, adding, a, suffix, ness, ity, ion, to, adjectives, or, verbs, happiness, and, serenity, from, the, adjectives, happy, and, serene, circulation, from, the, verb, circulate, illustrating, the, wide, range, of, possible, classifying, principles, for, nouns, the, awa, language, of, papua, new, guinea, regiments, nouns, according, to, how, ownership, is, assigned, as, alienable, possession, or, inalienable, possession, an, alienably, possessed, item, a, tree, for, example, can, exist, even, without, a, possessor, but, inalienably, possessed, items, are, necessarily, associated, with, their, possessor, and, are, referred, to, differently, for, example, with, nouns, that, function, as, kin, terms, meaning, father, etc, body, part, nouns, meaning, shadow, hair, etc, or, part, whole, nouns, meaning, top, bottom, etc, a, noun, phrase, or, np, is, a, phrase, usually, headed, by, a, common, noun, a, proper, noun, or, a, pronoun, the, head, may, be, the, only, constituent, or, it, may, be, modified, by, determiners, and, adjectives, for, example, the, dog, sat, near, ms, curtis, and, wagged, its, tail, contains, three, nps, the, dog, subject, of, the, verbs, sat, and, wagged, ms, curtis, complement, of, the, preposition, near, and, its, tail, object, of, wagged, you, became, their, teacher, contains, two, nps, you, subject, of, became, and, their, teacher, nouns, and, noun, phrases, can, typically, be, replaced, by, pronouns, such, as, he, it, she, they, which, these, and, those, to, avoid, repetition, or, explicit, identification, or, for, other, reasons, but, as, noted, earlier, current, theory, often, classifies, pronouns, as, a, subclass, of, nouns, parallel, to, prototypical, nouns, for, example, in, the, sentence, gareth, thought, she, was, weird, the, word, she, is, a, pronoun, that, refers, to, a, person, just, as, the, noun, gareth, does, the, word, one, can, replace, parts, of, noun, phrases, and, it, sometimes, stands, in, for, a, noun, an, example, is, given, below, but, one, can, also, stand, in, for, larger, parts, of, a, noun, phrase, for, example, in, the, following, example, one, can, stand, in, for, new, car, nominalization, is, a, process, whereby, a, word, that, belongs, to, another, part, of, speech, comes, to, be, used, as, a, noun, this, can, be, a, way, to, create, new, nouns, or, to, use, other, words, in, ways, that, resemble, nouns, in, french, and, spanish, for, example, adjectives, frequently, act, as, nouns, referring, to, people, who, have, the, characteristics, denoted, by, the, adjective, this, sometimes, happens, in, english, as, well, as, in, the, following, examples, for, definitions, of, nouns, based, on, the, concept, of, identity, criteria, for, more, on, identity, criteria, for, the, concept, that, nouns, are, prototypically, referential, for, an, attempt, to, relate, the, concepts, of, identity, criteria, and, prototypical, referentiality
