place, and, have, even, labelled, unicef, a, villain, for, the, extent, of, its, negative, impact, on, orphans, one, concern, is, that, the, child, mortality, rate, has, not, decreased, in, some, areas, as, rapidly, as, had, been, planned, especially, in, sub, saharan, africa, where, in, 2013, the, region, still, has, the, highest, child, mortality, rate, 92, deaths, per, 1000, live, births, and, that, globally, nearly, half, of, under, five, deaths, are, attributable, to, undernutrition, in, 2005, richard, horton, editor, in, chief, of, the, lancet, editorialized, that, over, 60, of, these, deaths, were, and, remain, preventable, and, that, the, coverage, levels, for, these, interventions, are, appallingly, low, in, the, 42, countries, that, account, for, 90, of, child, deaths, a, 27, million, unicef, program, in, west, africa, in, 2001, 2005, which, was, meant, to, decrease, child, deaths, from, disease, has, been, deemed, a, failure, according, to, a, study, that, found, higher, survival, rates, of, children, in, some, regions, that, weren, t, included, in, that, program, critics, argue, that, unicef, s, focus, on, rights, rather, than, safety, and, survival, is, idealistic, and, that, by, focusing, on, politicized, children, s, rights, instead, of, mere, child, survival, unicef, has, contributed, indirectly, to, the, child, mortality, crisis, in, 1995, in, what, was, called, the, worst, scandal, in, its, history, unicef, disclosed, that, 24, employees, in, its, kenya, office, stole, or, squandered, 10, million, this, fraud, consumed, more, than, a, quarter, of, the, unicef, s, 37, million, two, year, budget, for, kenya, in, germany, in, the, late, 2000s, unicef, was, accused, of, mismanagement, abuse, and, waste, of, funds, this, has, resulted, in, 5, 000, of, unicef, regular, donors, abandoning, their, support, from, the, charity, and, politicians, and, public, figures, including, angela, merkel, demanding, explanations, and, the, chairwoman, of, unicef, germany, resigning, in, 2008, in, 2012, unicef, confirmed, fraud, in, a, pakistan, school, rehabilitation, project, where, an, estimated, us, 4, million, was, lost, when,

center, had, accused, unicef, of, failure, to, take, action, to, prevent, abuses, he, stated, there, are, tens, of, thousands, of, aid, workers, around, the, world, with, pedophile, tendencies, but, if, you, wear, a, unicef, t, shirt, nobody, will, ask, what, you, re, up, to, in, december, 2020, unicef, made, funding, available, to, feed, children, in, the, uk, for, the, first, time, as, part,

are, famines, and, where, there, are, civil, wars, and, they, make, cheap, political, points, of, this, kind, giving, i, think, 25, 000, to, one, council, it, is, a, political, stunt, of, the, lowest,
