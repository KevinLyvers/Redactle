the, constitution, of, the, united, states, is, the, supreme, law, of, the, united, states, it, superseded, the, articles, of, confederation, the, nation, s, first, constitution, on, march, 4, 1789, originally, including, seven, articles, the, constitution, delineates, the, frame, of, the, federal, government, the, constitution, s, first, three, articles, embody, the, doctrine, of, the, separation, of, powers, in, which, the, federal, government, is, divided, into, three, branches, the, legislative, consisting, of, the, bicameral, congress, article, i, the, executive, consisting, of, the, president, and, subordinate, officers, article, ii, and, the, judicial, consisting, of, the, supreme, court, and, other, federal, courts, article, iii, article, iv, article, v, and, article, vi, embody, concepts, of, federalism, describing, the, rights, and, responsibilities, of, state, governments, the, states, in, relationship, to, the, federal, government, and, the, shared, process, of, constitutional, amendment, article, vii, establishes, the, procedure, subsequently, used, by, the, 13, states, to, ratify, it, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, is, the, oldest, and, longest, standing, written, and, codified, national, constitution, in, force, in, the, world, the, drafting, of, the, constitution, often, referred, to, as, its, framing, was, completed, at, the, constitutional, convention, which, assembled, at, independence, hall, in, philadelphia, between, may, 25, and, september, 17, 1787, delegates, to, the, convention, were, chosen, by, the, state, legislatures, of, 12, of, the, 13, original, states, rhode, island, refused, to, send, delegates, the, convention, s, initial, mandate, was, limited, to, amending, the, articles, of, confederation, which, had, proven, highly, ineffective, in, meeting, the, young, nation, s, needs, almost, immediately, however, delegates, began, considering, measures, to, replace, the, articles, the, first, proposal, discussed, introduced, by, delegates, from, virginia, called, for, a, bicameral, two, house, congress, that, was, to, be, elected, on, a, proportional, basis, based, on, state, population, an, elected, chief, executive, and, an, appointed, judicial, branch, an, alternative, to, the, virginia, plan, known, as, the, new, jersey, plan, also, called, for, an, elected, executive, but, retained, the, legislative, structure, created, by, the, articles, a, unicameral, congress, where, all, states, had, one, vote, on, june, 19, 1787, delegates, rejected, the, new, jersey, plan, with, three, states, voting, in, favor, seven, against, and, one, divided, the, plan, s, defeat, led, to, a, series, of, compromises, centering, primarily, on, two, issues, slavery, and, proportional, representation, the, first, of, these, pitted, northern, states, where, slavery, was, slowly, being, abolished, against, southern, states, whose, agricultural, economies, depended, on, slave, labor, the, issue, of, proportional, representation, was, of, similar, concern, to, less, populous, states, which, under, the, articles, had, the, same, power, as, larger, states, to, satisfy, interests, in, the, south, particularly, in, georgia, and, south, carolina, the, delegates, agreed, to, protect, the, slave, trade, that, is, the, importation, of, slaves, for, 20, years, slavery, was, protected, further, by, allowing, states, to, count, three, fifths, of, their, slaves, as, part, of, their, populations, for, the, purpose, of, representation, in, the, federal, government, and, by, requiring, the, return, of, escaped, slaves, to, their, owners, even, if, captured, in, states, where, slavery, had, been, abolished, finally, the, delegates, adopted, the, connecticut, compromise, which, proposed, a, congress, with, proportional, representation, in, the, lower, house, and, equal, representation, in, the, upper, house, the, senate, giving, each, state, two, senators, while, these, compromises, held, the, union, together, and, aided, the, constitution, s, ratification, slavery, continued, for, six, more, decades, and, the, less, populous, states, continue, to, have, disproportional, representation, in, the, u, s, senate, and, electoral, college, since, the, constitution, became, operational, in, 1789, it, has, been, amended, 27, times, the, first, ten, amendments, known, collectively, as, the, bill, of, rights, offer, specific, protections, of, individual, liberty, and, justice, and, place, restrictions, on, the, powers, of, government, within, the, u, s, states, the, majority, of, the, 17, later, amendments, expand, individual, civil, rights, protections, others, address, issues, related, to, federal, authority, or, modify, government, processes, and, procedures, amendments, to, the, united, states, constitution, unlike, ones, made, to, many, constitutions, worldwide, are, appended, to, the, document, the, original, u, s, constitution, was, handwritten, on, five, pages, of, parchment, by, jacob, shallus, the, first, permanent, constitution, it, is, interpreted, supplemented, and, implemented, by, a, large, body, of, federal, constitutional, law, and, has, influenced, the, constitutions, of, other, nations, from, september, 5, 1774, to, march, 1, 1781, the, second, continental, congress, convened, in, philadelphia, in, what, today, is, called, independence, hall, functioned, as, the, provisional, government, of, the, united, states, delegates, to, the, first, continental, congress, in, 1774, and, then, the, second, continental, congress, from, 1775, to, 1781, were, chosen, largely, from, the, revolutionary, committees, of, correspondence, in, various, colonies, rather, than, through, the, colonial, governments, of, the, thirteen, colonies, the, articles, of, confederation, and, perpetual, union, was, the, first, constitution, of, the, united, states, the, document, was, drafted, by, a, committee, appointed, by, the, second, continental, congress, in, mid, june, 1777, and, was, adopted, by, the, full, congress, in, mid, november, of, that, year, ratification, by, the, 13, colonies, took, more, than, three, years, and, was, completed, march, 1, 1781, the, articles, gave, little, power, to, the, central, government, while, the, confederation, congress, had, some, decision, making, abilities, it, lacked, enforcement, powers, the, implementation, of, most, decisions, including, amendments, to, the, articles, required, legislative, approval, by, all, 13, of, the, newly, formed, states, despite, these, limitations, based, on, the, congressional, authority, granted, in, article, 9, the, league, of, states, was, considered, as, strong, as, any, similar, republican, confederation, ever, formed, the, chief, problem, was, in, the, words, of, george, washington, no, money, the, confederated, congress, could, print, money, but, it, was, worthless, and, while, the, congress, could, borrow, money, it, could, not, pay, it, back, no, state, paid, its, share, of, taxes, to, support, the, government, and, some, paid, nothing, a, few, states, did, meet, the, interest, payments, toward, the, national, debt, owed, by, their, citizens, but, nothing, greater, and, no, interest, was, paid, on, debts, owed, foreign, governments, by, 1786, the, united, states, was, facing, default, on, its, outstanding, debts, under, the, articles, the, united, states, had, little, ability, to, defend, its, sovereignty, most, of, the, troops, in, the, nation, s, 625, man, army,

ransom, if, a, military, crisis, required, action, the, congress, had, no, credit, or, taxing, power, to, finance, a, response, domestically, the, articles, of, confederation, was, failing, to, bring, unity, to, the, diverse, sentiments, and, interests, of, the, various, states, although, the, treaty, of, paris, in, 1783, was, signed, between, britain, and, the, u, s, and, named, each, of, the, american, states, various, states, proceeded, to, violate, it, new, york, and, south, carolina, repeatedly, prosecuted, loyalists, for, wartime, activity, and, redistributed, their, lands, individual,

in, september, 1786, during, an, inter, state, convention, to, discuss, and, develop, a, consensus, about, reversing, the, protectionist, trade, barriers, that, each, state, had, erected, james, madison, questioned, whether, the, articles, of, confederation, was, a, binding, compact, or, even, a, viable, government, connecticut, paid, nothing, and, positively, refused, to, pay, u, s,

a, volunteer, army, congress, was, paralyzed, it, could, do, nothing, significant, without, nine, states, and, some, legislation, required, all, 13, when, a, state, produced, only, one, member, in, attendance, its, vote, was, not, counted, if, a, state, s, delegation, was, evenly, divided, its, vote, could, not, be, counted, towards, the, nine, count, requirement, the, congress, of, the, confederation, had, virtually, ceased, trying, to, govern, the, vision, of, a, respectable, nation, among, nations, seemed, to, be, fading, in, the, eyes, of, revolutionaries, such, as, george, washington, benjamin, franklin, and, rufus, king, their, dream, of, a, republic, a, nation, without, hereditary, rulers, with, power, derived, from, the, people, in, frequent, elections, was, in, doubt, on, february, 21, 1787, the, confederation, congress, called, a, convention, of, state, delegates, in, philadelphia, to, propose, revisions, to, the, articles, unlike, earlier, attempts, the, convention, was, not, meant, for, new, laws, or, piecemeal, alterations, but, for, the, sole, and, express, purpose, of, revising, the, articles, of, confederation, the, convention, was, not, limited, to, commerce, rather, it, was, intended, to, render, the, federal, constitution, adequate, to, the, exigencies, of, government, and, the, preservation, of, the, union, the, proposal, might, take, effect, when, approved, by, congress, and, the, states, on, the, appointed, day, may, 14, 1787, only, the, virginia, and, pennsylvania, delegations, were, present, and, the, convention, s, opening, meeting, was, postponed, for, lack, of, a, quorum, a, quorum, of, seven, states, met, on, may, 25, and, deliberations, began, eventually, 12, states, were, represented, with, rhode, island, refusing, to, participate, of, the, 74, delegates, appointed, by, the, states, 55, attended, the, delegates, were, generally, convinced, that, an, effective, central, government, with, a, wide, range, of, enforceable, powers, must, replace, the, weaker, congress, established, by, the, articles, of, confederation, two, plans, for, structuring, the, federal, government, arose, at, the, convention, s, outset, on, may, 31, the, convention, devolved, into, the, committee, of, the, whole, charged, with, considering, the, virginia, plan, on, june, 13, the, virginia, resolutions, in, amended, form,

represented, met, from, july, 2, to, 16, to, work, out, a, compromise, on, the, issue, of, representation, in, the, federal, legislature, all, agreed, to, a, republican, form, of, government, grounded, in, representing, the, people, in, the, states, for, the, legislature, two, issues, were, to, be, decided, how, the, votes, were, to, be, allocated, among, the, states, in, the, congress, and, how, the, representatives, should, be, elected, in, its, report, now, known, as, the, connecticut, compromise, or, great, compromise, the, committee, proposed, proportional, representation, for, seats, in, the, house, of, representatives, based, on, population, with, the, people, voting, for, representatives, and, equal, representation, for, each, state, in, the, senate, with, each, state, s, legislators, generally, choosing, their, respective, senators, and, that, all, money, bills, would, originate, in, the, house, the, great, compromise, ended, the, stalemate, between, patriots, and, nationalists, leading, to, numerous, other, compromises, in, a, spirit, of, accommodation, there, were, sectional, interests, to, be, balanced, by, the, three, fifths, compromise, reconciliation, on, presidential, term, powers, and, method, of, selection, and, jurisdiction, of, the, federal, judiciary, on, july, 24, a, committee, of, detail, including, john, rutledge, south, carolina, edmund, randolph, virginia, nathaniel, gorham, massachusetts, oliver, ellsworth, connecticut, and, james, wilson, pennsylvania, was, elected, to, draft, a, detailed, constitution, reflective, of, the, resolutions, passed, by, the, convention, up, to, that, point, the, convention, recessed, from, july, 26, to, august, 6, to, await, the, report, of, this, committee, of, detail, overall, the, report,

september, 17, at, the, convention, s, final, session, several, of, the, delegates, were, disappointed, in, the, result, a, makeshift, series, of, unfortunate, compromises, some, delegates, left, before, the, ceremony, and, three, others, refused, to, sign, of, the, thirty, nine, signers, benjamin, franklin, summed, up, addressing, the, convention, there, are, several, parts, of, this, constitution, which, i, do, not, at, present, approve, but, i, am, not, sure, i, shall, never, approve, them, he, would, accept, the, constitution, because, i, expect, no, better, and, because, i, am, not, sure, that, it, is, not, the, best, the, advocates, of, the, constitution, were, anxious, to, obtain, unanimous, support, of, all, twelve, states, represented, in, the, convention, their, accepted, formula, for, the, closing, endorsement, was, done, in, convention, by, the, unanimous, consent, of, the, states, present, at, the, end, of, the, convention, the, proposal, was, agreed, to, by, eleven, state, delegations, and, the, lone, remaining, delegate, from, new, york, alexander, hamilton, within, three, days, of, its, signing, on, september, 17, 1787, the, constitution, was, submitted, to, the, congress, of, the, confederation, then, sitting, in, new, york, city, the, nation, s, temporary, capital, the, document, originally, intended, as, a, revision, of, the, articles, of, confederation, instead, introduced, a, completely, new, form, of, government, while, members, of, congress, had, the, power, to, reject, it, they, voted, unanimously, on, september, 28, to, forward, the, proposal, to, the, thirteen, states, for, their, ratification, under, the, process, outlined, in, article, vii, of, the, proposed, constitution, the, state, legislatures, were, tasked, with, organizing, federal, conventions, to, ratify, the, document, this, process, ignored, the, amendment, provision, of, the, articles, of, confederation, which, required, unanimous, approval, of, all, the, states, instead, article, vii, called, for, ratification, by, just, nine, of, the, 13, states, a, two, thirds, majority, two, factions, soon, emerged, one, supporting, the, constitution, the, federalists, and, the, other, opposing, it, the, so, called, anti, federalists, over, the, ensuing, months, the, proposal, was, debated, criticized, and, expounded, upon, clause, by, clause, in, the, state, of, new, york, at, the, time, a, hotbed, of, anti, federalism, three, delegates, from, the, philadelphia, convention, who, were, also, members, of, the, congress, hamilton, madison, and, jay, published, a, series, of, commentaries, now, known, as, the, federalist, papers, in, support, of, ratification, before, year, s, end, three, state, legislatures, voted, in, favor, of, ratification, delaware, was, first, voting, unanimously, 30, 0, pennsylvania, second, approving, the, measure, 46, 23, and, new, jersey, third, also, recording, a, unanimous, vote, as, 1788, began, connecticut, and, georgia, followed, delaware, s, lead, with, almost, unanimous, votes, but, the, outcome, became, less, certain, as, leaders, in, key, states, such, as, virginia, new, york, and, massachusetts, expressed, concerns, over, the, lack, of, protections, for, people, s, rights, fearing, the, prospect, of, defeat, the, federalists, relented, promising, that, if, the, constitution, was, adopted, amendments, would, be, added, to, secure, individual, liberties, with, that, the, anti, federalists, position, collapsed, on, june, 21, 1788, new, hampshire, became, the, ninth, state, to, ratify, three, months, later, on, september, 17, the, congress, of, the, confederation, certified, the, ratification, of, eleven, states, and, passed, resolutions, setting, dates, for, choosing, the, first, senators, and, representatives, the, first, wednesday, of, january, january, 7, 1789, electing, the, first, president, the, first, wednesday, of, february, february, 4, and, officially,

agreed, to, purchase, 10, square, miles, from, maryland, and, virginia, for, establishing, a, permanent, capital, north, carolina, waited, to, ratify, the, constitution, until, after, the, bill, of, rights, was, passed, by, the, new, congress, and, rhode, island, s, ratification, would, only, come, after, a, threatened, trade, embargo, the, u, s, constitution, was, a, federal, one, and, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, study, of, magna, carta, and, other, federations, both, ancient, and, extant, the, due, process, clause, of, the, constitution, was, partly, based, on, common, law, and, on, magna, carta, 1215, which, had, become, a, foundation, of, english, liberty, against, arbitrary, power, wielded, by, a, ruler, the, idea, of, separation, of, powers, inherent, in, the, constitution, was, largely, inspired, by, eighteenth, century, enlightenment, philosophers, such, as, montesquieu, and, john, locke, the, influence, of, montesquieu, locke, edward, coke, and, william, blackstone, were, evident, at, the, constitutional, convention, prior, to, and, during, the, framing, and, signing, of, the, constitution, blackstone, hume, locke, and, montesquieu, were, among, the, political, philosophers, most, frequently, referred, to, historian, herbert, w, schneider, held, that, the, scottish, enlightenment, was, probably, the, most, potent, single, tradition, in, the, american, enlightenment, and, the, advancement, of, personal, liberties, historian, jack, p, greene, maintains, that, by, 1776, the, founders, drew, heavily, upon, magna, carta, and, the, later, writings, of, enlightenment, rationalism, and, english, common, law, historian, daniel, walker, howe, notes, that, benjamin, franklin, greatly, admired, david, hume, an, eighteenth, century, scottish, philosopher, and, had, studied, many, of, his, works, while, at, edinburgh, in, 1760, both, embraced, the, idea, that, high, ranking, public, officials, should, receive, no, salary, and, that, the, lower, class, was, a, better, judge, of, character, when, it, came, to, choosing, their, representatives, in, his, institutes, of, the, lawes, of, england, coke, interpreted, magna, carta, protections, and, rights, to, apply, not, just, to, nobles, but, to, all, british, subjects, in, writing, the, virginia, charter, of, 1606, he, enabled, the, king, in, parliament, to, give, those, to, be, born, in, the, colonies, all, rights, and, liberties, as, though, they, were, born, in, england, william, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, are, considered, the, most, influential, books, on, law, in, the, new, republic, madison, made, frequent, reference, to, blackstone, locke, and, montesquieu, all, of, whom, were, among, the, most, prominent, political, theorists, of, the, late, eighteenth, century, following, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, british, political, philosopher, john, locke, was, a, major, influence, expanding, on, the, contract, theory, of, government, advanced, by, thomas, hobbes, his, contemporary, locke, advanced, the, principle, of, consent, of, the, governed, in, his, two, treatises, of, government, government, s, duty, under, a, social, contract, among, the, sovereign, people, was, to, serve, the, people, by, protecting, their, rights, these, basic, rights, were, life, liberty, and, property, montesquieu, s, influence, on, the, framers, is, evident, in, madison, s, federalist, no, 47, and, hamilton, s, federalist, no, 78, jefferson, adams, and, mason, were, known, to, read, montesquieu, supreme, court, justices, the, ultimate, interpreters, of, the, constitution, have, cited, montesquieu, throughout, the, court, s, history, see, e, g, green, v, biddle, 21, u, s, 1, 1, 36, 1823, united, states, v,

1310, 1330, 2016, montesquieu, emphasized, the, need, for, balanced, forces, pushing, against, each, other, to, prevent, tyranny, reflecting, the, influence, of, polybius, s, 2nd, century, bc, treatise, on, the, checks, and, balances, of, the, roman, republic, in, his, the, spirit, of, law, montesquieu, maintained, that, the, separation, of, state, powers, should, be, by, its, service, to, the, people, s, liberty, legislative, executive, and, judicial, while, also, emphasizing, that, the, idea, of, separation, had, for, its, purpose, the, even, distribution, of, authority, among, the, several, branches, of, government, the, english, bill, of, rights, 1689, was, an, inspiration, for, the, american, bill, of, rights, both, require, jury, trials, contain, a, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, prohibit, excessive, bail, and, forbid, cruel, and, unusual, punishments, many, liberties, protected, by, state, constitutions, and, the, virginia, declaration, of, rights, were, incorporated, into, the, bill, of, rights, upon, the, arrival, of, the, american, revolution, many, of, the, rights, guaranteed, by, the, federal, bill, of, rights, were, recognized, as, being, inspired, by, english, law, a, substantial, body, of, thought, had, been, developed, from, the, literature, of, republicanism, in, the, united, states, typically, demonstrated, by, the, works, of, john, adams, who, often, quoted, blackstone, and, montesquieu, verbatim, and, applied, to, the, creation, of, state, constitutions, while, the, ideas, of, unalienable, rights, the, separation, of, powers, and, the, structure, of, the, constitution, were, largely, influenced, by, the, european, enlightenment, thinkers, like, montesquieu, john, locke, and, others, benjamin, franklin, and, thomas, jefferson, still, had, reservations, about, the, existing, forms, of, government, in, europe, in, a, speech, at, the, constitutional, convention, franklin, stated, we, have, gone, back, to, ancient, history, for, models, of, government, and, examined, different, forms, of, those, republics, and, we, have, viewed, modern, states, all, round, europe, but, find, none, of, their, constitutions, suitable, to, our, circumstances, jefferson, maintained, that, most, european, governments, were, autocratic, monarchies, and, not, compatible, with, the, egalitarian, character, of, the, american, people, in, a, 1787, letter, to, john, rutledge, jefferson, asserted, that, the, only, condition, on, earth, to, be, compared, with, is, that, of, the, indians, where, they, still, have, less, law, than, we, in, that, same, letter, jefferson, maintained, that, american, government, with, its, native, american, features, marked, a, great, improvement, over, the, european, models, american, indian, history, scholars, donald, grinde, and, bruce, johansen, claim, there, is, overwhelming, evidence, that, iroquois, confederacy, political, concepts, and, ideas, influenced, the, u, s, constitution, and, are, considered, to, be, the, most, outspoken, supporters, of, the, iroquois, thesis, the, idea, as, to, the, extent, of, that, influence, on, the, founding, however, varies, among, historians, and, has, been, questioned, or, criticized, by, various, historians, including, samuel, payne, william, starna, george, hamell, and, historian, and, archaeologist, philip, levy, who,

that, amendments, were, to, be, proposed, by, congress, and, ratified, by, the, unanimous, vote, of, all, 13, state, legislatures, this, proved, to, be, a, major, flaw, in, the, articles, as, it, created, an, insurmountable, obstacle, to, constitutional, reform, the, amendment, process, crafted, during, the, philadelphia, constitutional, convention, was, according, to, the, federalist, no, 43, designed, to, establish, a, balance, between, pliancy, and, rigidity, it, guards, equally, against, that, extreme, facility, which, would, render, the, constitution, too, mutable, and, that, extreme, difficulty, which, might, perpetuate, its, discovered, faults, it, moreover, equally, enables, the, general, and, the, state, governments, to, originate, the, amendment, of, errors, as, they, may, be, pointed, out, by, the, experience, on, one, side, or, on, the, other, there, are, two, steps, in, the, amendment, process, proposals, to, amend, the, constitution, must, be, properly, adopted, and, ratified, before, they, change, the, constitution, first, there, are, two, procedures, for, adopting, the, language, of, a, proposed, amendment, either, by, a, congress, by, two, thirds, majority, in, both, the, senate, and, the, house, of, representatives, or, b, national, convention, which, shall, take, place, whenever, two, thirds, of, the, state, legislatures, collectively, call, for, one, second, there, are, two, procedures, for, ratifying, the, proposed, amendment, which, requires, three, fourths, of, the, states, presently, 38, of, 50, approval, a, consent, of, the, state, legislatures, or, b, consent, of, state, ratifying, conventions, the, ratification, method, is, chosen, by, congress, for, each, amendment, state, ratifying, conventions, were, used, only, once, for, the, twenty, first, amendment, presently, the, archivist, of, the, united, states, is, charged, with, responsibility, for, administering, the, ratification, process, under, the, provisions, of, 1, u, s, code, 106b, the, archivist, submits, the, proposed, amendment, to, the, states, for, their, consideration, by, sending, a, letter, of, notification, to, each, governor, each, governor, then, formally, submits, the, amendment, to, their, state, s, legislature, when, a, state, ratifies, a, proposed, amendment, it, sends, the, archivist, an, original, or, certified, copy, of, the, state, s, action, ratification, documents, are, examined, by, the, office, of, the, federal, register, for, facial, legal, sufficiency, and, an, authenticating, signature, article, five, ends, by, shielding, certain, clauses, in, the, new, frame, of, government, from, being, amended, article, one, section, 9, clause, 1, prevents, congress, from, passing, any, law, that, would, restrict, the, importation, of, slaves, into, the, united, states, prior, to, 1808, plus, the, fourth, clause, from, that, same, section, which, reiterates, the, constitutional, rule, that, direct, taxes, must, be, apportioned, according, to, state, populations, these, clauses, were, explicitly, shielded, from, constitutional, amendment, prior, to, 1808, on, january, 1, 1808, the, first, day, it, was, permitted, to, do, so, congress, approved, legislation, prohibiting, the, importation, of, slaves, into, the, country, on, february, 3, 1913, with, ratification, of, the, sixteenth, amendment, congress, gained, the, authority, to, levy, an, income, tax, without, apportioning, it, among, the, states, or, basing, it, on, the, united, states, census, the, third, textually, entrenched, provision, is, article, one, section, 3, clauses, 1, which, provides, for, equal, representation, of, the, states, in, the, senate, the, shield, protecting, this, clause, from, the, amendment, process, no, state, without, its, consent, shall, be, deprived, of, its, equal, suffrage, in, the, senate, is, less, absolute, but, it, is, permanent, article, vi, establishes, that, the, constitution, and, all, federal, laws, and, treaties, made, in, accordance, with, it, have, supremacy, over, state, laws, and, that, the, judges, in, every, state, shall, be, bound, thereby, any, thing, in, the, laws, or, constitutions, of, any, state, notwithstanding, it, validates, national, debt, created, under, the, articles, of, confederation, and, requires, that, all, federal, and, state, legislators, officers, and, judges, take, oaths, or, affirmations, to, support, the, constitution, this, means, that, the, states, constitutions, and, laws, should, not, conflict, with, the, laws, of, the, federal, constitution, and, that, in, case, of, a, conflict, state, judges, are, legally, bound, to, honor, the, federal, laws, and, constitution, over, those, of, any, state, article, six, also, states, no, religious, test, shall, ever, be, required, as, a, qualification, to, any, office, or, public, trust, under, the, united, states, article, vii, describes, the, process, for, establishing, the, proposed, new, frame, of, government, anticipating, that, the, influence, of, many, state, politicians, would, be, antifederalist, delegates, to, the, philadelphia, convention, provided, for, ratification, of, the, constitution, by, popularly, elected, ratifying, conventions, in, each, state, the, convention, method, also, made, it, possible, that, judges, ministers, and, others, ineligible, to, serve, in, state, legislatures, could, be, elected, to, a, convention, suspecting, that, rhode, island, at, least, might, not, ratify, delegates, decided, that, the, constitution, would, go, into, effect, as, soon, as, nine, states, two, thirds, rounded, up, ratified, each, of, the, remaining, four, states, could, then, join, the, newly, formed, union, by, ratifying, the, signing, of, the, united, states, constitution, occurred, on, september, 17, 1787, when, 39, delegates, endorsed, the, constitution, created, during, the, convention, in, addition, to, signatures, this, closing, endorsement, the, constitution, s, eschatocol, included, a, brief, declaration, that, the, delegates, work, has, been, successfully, completed, and, that, those, whose, signatures, appear, on, it, subscribe, to, the, final, document, included, are, a, statement, pronouncing, the, document, s, adoption, by, the, states, present, a, formulaic, dating, of, its, adoption, and, the, delegates, signatures, additionally, the, convention, s, secretary, william, jackson, added, a, note, to, verify, four, amendments, made, by, hand, to, the, final, document, and, signed, the, note, to, authenticate, its, validity, the, language, of, the, concluding, endorsement, conceived, by, gouverneur, morris, and, presented, to, the, convention, by, benjamin, franklin, was, made, intentionally, ambiguous, in, hopes, of, winning, over, the, votes, of, dissenting, delegates, advocates, for, the, new, frame, of, government, realizing, the, impending, difficulty, of, obtaining, the, consent, of, the, states, needed, to, make, it, operational, were, anxious, to, obtain, the, unanimous, support, of, the, delegations, from, each, state, it, was, feared, that, many, of, the, delegates, would, refuse, to, give, their, individual, assent, to, the, constitution, therefore, in, order, that, the, action, of, the, convention, would, appear, to, be, unanimous, the, formula, done, in, convention, by, the, unanimous, consent, of, the, states, present, was, devised, the, document, is, dated, the, seventeenth, day, of, september, in, the, year, of, our, lord, 1787, and, of, the, independence, of, the, united, states, of, america, the, twelfth, this, two, fold, epoch, dating, serves, to, place, the, constitution, in, the, context, of, the, religious, traditions, of, western, civilization, and, at, the, same, time, links, it, to, the, regime, principles, proclaimed, in, the, declaration, of, independence, this, dual, reference, can, also, be, found, in, the, articles, of, confederation, and, the, northwest, ordinance, the, closing, endorsement, serves, an, authentication, function, only, it, neither, assigns, powers, to, the, federal, government, nor, does, it, provide, specific, limitations, on, government, action, it, does, however, provide, essential, documentation, of, the, constitution, s, validity, a, statement, of, this, is, what, was, agreed, to, it, records, who, signed, the, constitution, and, when, and, where, the, procedure, for, amending, the, constitution, is, outlined, in, article, v, see, above, the, process, is, overseen, by, the, archivist, of, the, united, states, between, 1949, and, 1985, it, was, overseen, by, the, administrator, of, general, services, and, before, that, by, the, secretary, of, state, under, article, five, a, proposal, for, an, amendment, must, be, adopted, either, by, two, thirds, of, both, houses, of, congress, or, by, a, national, convention, that, had, been, requested, by, two, thirds, of, the, state, legislatures, once, the, proposal, has, passed, by, either, method, congress, must, decide, whether, the, proposed, amendment, is, to, be, ratified, by, state, legislatures, or, by, state, ratifying, conventions, the, proposed, amendment, along, with, the, method, of, ratification, is, sent, to, the, office, of, the, federal, register, which, copies, it, in, slip, law, format, and, submits, it, to, the, states, to, date, the, convention, method, of, proposal, has, never, been, tried, and, the, convention, method, of, ratification, has, only, been, used, once, for, the, twenty, first, amendment, a, proposed, amendment, becomes, an, operative, part, of, the, constitution, as, soon, as, it, is, ratified, by, three, fourths, of, the, states, currently, 38, of, the, 50, states, there, is, no, further, step, the, text, requires, no, additional, action, by, congress, or, anyone, else, after, ratification, by, the, required, number, of, states, thus, when, the, office, of, the, federal, register, verifies, that, it, has, received, the, required, number, of, authenticated, ratification, documents, it, drafts, a, formal, proclamation, for, the, archivist, to, certify, that, the, amendment, is, valid, and, has, become, part, of, the, nation, s, frame, of, government, this, certification, is, published, in, the, federal, register, and, united, states, statutes, at, large, and, serves, as, official, notice, to, congress, and, to, the, nation, that, the, ratification, process, has, been, successfully, completed, the, constitution, has, twenty, seven, amendments, structurally, the, constitution, s, original, text, and, all, prior, amendments, remain, untouched, the, precedent, for, this, practice, was, set, in, 1789, when, congress, considered, and, proposed, the, first, several, constitutional, amendments, among, these, amendments, 1, 10, are, collectively, known, as, the, bill, of, rights, and, amendments, 13, 15, are, known, as, the, reconstruction, amendments, excluding, the, twenty, seventh, amendment, which, was, pending, before, the, states, for, 202, years, 225, days, the, longest, pending, amendment, that, was, successfully, ratified, was, the, twenty, second, amendment, which, took, 3, years, 343, days, the, twenty, sixth, amendment, was, ratified, in, the, shortest, time, 100, days, the, average, ratification, time, for, the, first, twenty, six, amendments, was, 1, year, 252, days, for, all, twenty, seven, 9, years, 48, days, the, first, ten, amendments, introduced, were, referred, to, as, the, bill, of, rights, which, consists, of, 10, amendments, that, were, added, to, the, constitution, in, 1791, as, supporters, of, the, constitution, had, promised, critics, during, the, debates, of, 1788, the, first, amendment, 1791, prohibits, congress, from, obstructing, the, exercise, of, certain, individual, freedoms, freedom, of, religion, freedom, of, speech, freedom, of, the, press, freedom, of, assembly, and, right, to, petition, its, free, exercise, clause, guarantees, a, person, s, right, to, hold, whatever, religious, beliefs, they, want, and, to, freely, exercise, that, belief, and, its, establishment, clause, prevents, the, federal, government, from, creating, an, official, national, church, or, favoring, one, set, of, religious, beliefs, over, another, the, amendment, guarantees, an, individual, s, right, to, express, and, to, be, exposed, to, a, wide, range, of, opinions, and, views, it, was, intended, to, ensure, a, free, exchange, of, ideas, even, unpopular, ones, it, also, guarantees, an, individual, s, right, to, physically, gather, or,

government, by, implication, the, anti, federalists, persisted, and, several, state, ratification, conventions, refused, to, ratify, the, constitution, without, a, more, specific, list, of,

income, tax, on, rents, dividends, and, interest, unconstitutional, this, amendment, has, become, the, basis, for, all, subsequent, federal, income, tax, legislation, and, has, greatly, expanded, the, scope, of, federal, taxing, and, spending, in, the, years, since, the, eighteenth, amendment, 1919, prohibited, the, making, transporting, and, selling, of, alcoholic, beverages, nationwide, it, also, authorized, congress, to, enact, legislation, enforcing, this, prohibition, adopted, at, the, urging, of, a, national, temperance, movement, proponents, believed, that, the, use, of, alcohol, was, reckless, and, destructive, and, that, prohibition, would, reduce, crime, and, corruption, solve, social, problems, decrease, the, need, for, welfare, and, prisons, and, improve, the, health, of, all, americans, during, prohibition, it, is, estimated, that, alcohol, consumption, and, alcohol, related, deaths, declined, dramatically, but, prohibition, had, other, more, negative, consequences, the,

authorized, congress, to, enforce, abolition, though, millions, of, slaves, had, been, declared, free, by, the, 1863, emancipation, proclamation, their, post, civil, war, status, was, unclear, as, was, the, status, of, other, millions, congress, intended, the, thirteenth, amendment, to, be, a, proclamation, of, freedom, for, all, slaves, throughout, the, nation, and, to, take, the, question, of, emancipation, away, from, politics, this, amendment, rendered, inoperative, or, moot, several, of, the, original, parts, of, the, constitution, the, fourteenth, amendment, 1868, granted, united, states, citizenship, to, former, slaves, and, to, all, persons, subject, to, u, s, jurisdiction, it, also, contained, three, new, limits, on, state, power, a, state, shall, not, violate, a, citizen,

these, limitations, dramatically, expanded, the, protections, of, the, constitution, this, amendment, according, to, the, supreme, court, s, doctrine, of, incorporation, makes, most, provisions, of, the, bill, of, rights, applicable, to, state, and, local, governments, as, well, it, superseded, the, mode, of, apportionment, of, representatives, delineated, in, article, 1, section, 2, clause, 3,

established, as, the, nation, s, capital, in, 1800, the, district, of, columbia, s, five, thousand, residents, had, neither, a, local, government, nor, the, right, to, vote, in, federal, elections, by, 1960, the, population, of, the, district, had, grown, to, over, 760, 000, the, twenty, fourth, amendment, 1964, prohibits, a, poll, tax, for, voting, although, passage, of, the, thirteenth, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, amendments, helped, remove, many, of, the, discriminatory, laws, left, over, from, slavery, they, did, not, eliminate, all, forms, of, discrimination, along, with, literacy, tests, and, durational, residency, requirements, poll, taxes, were, used, to, keep, low, income, primarily, african, american, citizens, from, participating, in, elections, the, supreme,

changes, the, date, on, which, a, new, president, vice, president, and, congress, take, office, thus, shortening, the, time, between, election, day, and, the, beginning, of, presidential, vice, presidential, and, congressional, terms, originally, the, constitution, provided, that, the, annual, meeting, was, to, be, on, the, first, monday, in, december, unless, otherwise, provided, by, law, this, meant, that, when, a, new, congress, was, elected, in, november, it, did, not, come, into, office, until, the, following, march, with, a, lame, duck, congress, convening, in, the, interim, by, moving, the, beginning, of, the, president, s, new, term, from, march, 4, to, january, 20, and, in, the, case, of, congress, to, january, 3, proponents, hoped, to, put, an, end, to, lame, duck, sessions, while, allowing, for, a, speedier, transition, for, the, new, administration, and, legislators, the, twenty, second, amendment, 1951, limits, an, elected, president, to, two, terms, in, office, a, total, of, eight, years, however, under, some, circumstances, it, is, possible, for, an, individual, to, serve, more, than, eight, years, although, nothing, in, the, original, frame, of, government, limited, how, many, presidential, terms, one, could, serve, the, nation, s, first, president, george, washington, declined, to, run, for, a, third, term, suggesting, that, two, terms, of, four, years, were, enough, for, any, president, this, precedent, remained, an, unwritten, rule, of, the, presidency, until, broken, by, franklin, d, roosevelt, who, was, elected, to, a, third, term, as, president, 1940, and, in, 1944, to, a, fourth, the, twenty, fifth, amendment, 1967, clarifies, what, happens, upon, the, death, removal, or, resignation, of, the, president, or, vice, president, and, how, the, presidency, is, temporarily, filled, if, the, president, becomes, disabled, and, cannot, fulfill, the, responsibilities, of, the, office, it, supersedes, the, ambiguous, succession, rule, established, in, article, ii, section, 1, clause, 6, a, concrete, plan, of, succession, has, been, needed, on, multiple, occasions, since, 1789, however, for, nearly, 20, of, u, s, history,

during, the, current, session, rather, any, raises, that, are, adopted, must, take, effect, during, the, next, session, of, congress, its, proponents, believed, that, federal, legislators, would, be, more, likely, to, be, cautious, about, increasing, congressional, pay, if, they, have, no, personal, stake, in, the, vote, article, one, section, 6, clause, 1, has, been, affected, by, this, amendment, which, remained, pending, for, over, two, centuries, as, it, contained, no, time, limit, for, ratification, collectively, members, of, the, house, and, senate, propose, around, 150, amendments, during, each, two, year, term, of, congress, most, however, never, get, out, of, the, congressional, committees, in, which, they, are, proposed, and, only, a, fraction, of, those, approved, in, committee, receive, sufficient, support, to, win, congressional, approval, and, actually, enter, the, constitutional, ratification, process, six, amendments, approved, by, congress, and, proposed, to, the, states, for, consideration, have, not, been, ratified, by, the, required, number, of, states, to, become, part, of, the, constitution, four, of, these, are, technically, still, pending, as, congress, did, not, set, a, time, limit, see, also, coleman, v, miller, for, their, ratification, the, other, two, are, no, longer, pending, as, both, had, a, time, limit, attached, and, in, both, cases, the, time, period, set, for, their, ratification, expired, the, way, the, constitution, is, understood, is, influenced, by, court, decisions, especially, those, of, the, supreme, court, these, decisions, are, referred, to, as, precedents, judicial, review, is, the, power, of, the, court, to, examine, federal, legislation, federal, executive, and, all, state, branches, of, government, to, decide, their, constitutionality, and, to, strike, them, down, if, found, unconstitutional, judicial, review, includes, the, power, of, the, court, to, explain, the, meaning, of, the, constitution, as, it, applies, to, particular, cases, over, the, years, court, decisions, on, issues, ranging, from, governmental, regulation, of, radio, and, television, to, the, rights, of, the, accused, in, criminal, cases, have, changed, the, way, many, constitutional, clauses, are, interpreted, without, amendment, to, the, actual, text, of, the, constitution, legislation, passed, to, implement, the, constitution, or, to, adapt, those, implementations, to, changing, conditions, broadens, and, in, subtle, ways, changes, the, meanings, given, to, the, words, of, the, constitution, up, to, a, point, the, rules, and, regulations, of, the, many, federal, executive, agencies, have, a, similar, effect, if, an, action, of, congress, or, the, agencies, is, challenged, however, the, court, system, ultimately, decides, whether, these, actions, are, permissible, under, the, constitution, courts, established, by, the, constitution, can, regulate, government, under, the, constitution, the, supreme, law, of, the, land, first, they, have, jurisdiction, over, actions, by, an, officer, of, government, and, state, law, second, federal, courts, may, rule, on, whether, coordinate, branches, of, national, government, conform, to, the, constitution, until, the, twentieth, century, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, may, have, been, the, only, high, tribunal, in, the, world, to, use, a, court, for, constitutional, interpretation, of, fundamental, law, others, generally, depending, on, their, national, legislature, the, basic, theory, of, american, judicial, review, is, summarized, by, constitutional, legal, scholars, and, historians, as, follows, the, written, constitution, is, fundamental, law, within, the, states, it, can, change, only, by, extraordinary, legislative, process, of, national, proposal, then, state, ratification, the, powers, of, all, departments, are, limited, to, enumerated, grants, found, in, the, constitution, courts, are, expected, a, to, enforce, provisions, of, the, constitution, as, the, supreme, law, of, the, land, and, b, to, refuse, to, enforce, anything, in, conflict, with, it, as, to, judicial, review, and, the, congress, the, first, proposals, by, madison, virginia, and, wilson, pennsylvania, called, for, a, supreme, court, veto, over, national, legislation, in, this, it, resembled, the, system, in, new, york, where, the, constitution, of, 1777, called, for, a, council, of, revision, by, the, governor, and, justices, of, the, state, supreme, court, the, council, would, review, and, veto, any, passed, legislation, violating, the, spirit, of, the, constitution, before, it, went, into, effect, the, nationalist, s, proposal, in, convention, was, defeated, three, times, and, replaced, by, a, presidential, veto, with, congressional, over, ride, judicial, review, relies, on, the, jurisdictional, authority, in, article, iii, and, the, supremacy, clause, the, justification, for, judicial, review, is, to, be, explicitly, found, in, the, open, ratifications, held, in, the, states, and, reported, in, their, newspapers, john, marshall, in, virginia, james, wilson, in, pennsylvania, and, oliver, ellsworth, of, connecticut, all, argued, for, supreme, court, judicial, review, of, acts, of, state, legislature, in, federalist, no, 78, alexander, hamilton, advocated, the, doctrine, of, a, written, document, held, as, a, superior, enactment, of, the, people, a, limited, constitution, can, be, preserved, in, practice, no, other, way, than, through, courts, which, can, declare, void, any, legislation, contrary, to, the, constitution, the, preservation, of, the, people, s, authority, over, legislatures, rests, particularly, with, judges, the, supreme, court, was, initially, made, up, of, jurists, who, had, been, intimately, connected, with, the, framing, of, the, constitution, and, the, establishment, of, its, government, as, law, john, jay, new, york, a, co, author, of, the, federalist, papers, served, as, chief, justice, for, the, first, six, years, the, second, chief, justice, john, rutledge, south, carolina, was, appointed, by, washington, in, 1795, as, a, recess, appointment, but, was, not, confirmed, by, the, senate, resigning, later, that, year, he, was, succeeded, in, 1796, by, the, third, chief, justice, oliver, ellsworth, connecticut, both, rutledge, and, ellsworth, were, delegates, to, the, constitutional, convention, john, marshall, virginia, the, fourth, chief, justice, had, served, in, the, virginia, ratification, convention, in, 1788, his, 34, years, of, service, on, the, court, would, see, some, of, the, most, important, rulings, to, help, establish, the, nation, the, constitution, had, begun, other, early, members, of, the, supreme, court, who, had, been, delegates, to, the, constitutional, convention, included, james, wilson, pennsylvania, for, ten, years, and, john, blair, jr, virginia, for, five, years, when, john, marshall, followed, oliver, ellsworth, as, chief, justice, of, the, supreme, court, in, 1801, the, federal, judiciary, had, been, established, by, the, judiciary, act, but, there, were, few, cases, and, less, prestige, the, fate, of, judicial, review, was, in, the, hands, of, the, supreme, court, itself, review, of, state, legislation, and, appeals, from, state, supreme, courts, was, understood, but, the, court, s, life, jurisdiction, over, state, legislation, was, limited, the, marshall, court, s, landmark, barron, v, baltimore, held, that, the, bill, of, rights, restricted, only, the, federal, government, and, not, the, states, in, the, landmark, marbury, v, madison, case, the, supreme, court, asserted, its, authority, of, judicial, review, over, acts, of, congress, its, findings, were, that, marbury, and, the, others, had, a, right, to, their, commissions, as, judges, in, the, district, of, columbia, marshall, writing, the, opinion, for, the, majority, announced, his, discovered, conflict, between, section, 13, of, the, judiciary, act, of, 1789, and, article, iii, in, this, case, both, the, constitution, and, the, statutory, law, applied, to, the, particulars, at, the, same, time, the, very, essence, of, judicial, duty, according, to, marshall, was, to, determine, which, of, the, two, conflicting, rules, should, govern, the, constitution, enumerates, powers, of, the, judiciary, to, extend, to, cases, arising, under, the, constitution, further, justices, take, a, constitutional, oath, to, uphold, it, as, supreme, law, of, the, land, therefore, since, the, united, states, government, as, created, by, the, constitution, is, a, limited, government, the, federal, courts, were, required, to, choose, the, constitution, over, congressional, law, if, there, were, deemed, to, be, a, conflict, this, argument, has, been, ratified, by, time, and, by, practice, the, supreme, court, did, not, declare, another, act, of, congress, unconstitutional, until, the, controversial, dred, scott, decision, in, 1857, held, after, the, voided, missouri, compromise, statute, had, already, been, repealed, in, the, eighty, years, following, the, civil, war,

standing, to, sue, simply, having, the, money, to, sue, and, being, injured, by, government, action, are, not, enough, these, three, procedural, ways, of, dismissing, cases, have, led, critics, to, charge, that, the, supreme, court, delays, decisions, by, unduly, insisting, on, technicalities, in, their, standards, of, litigability, they, say, cases, are, left, unconsidered, which, are, in, the,

it, does, a, rule, of, constitutional, law, is, formulated, only, as, the, precise, facts, in, the, case, require, the, court, will, choose, statutes, or, general, law, for, the, basis, of, its,
