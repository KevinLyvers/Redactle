the, term, tribe, is, used, in, many, different, contexts, to, refer, to, a, category, of, human, social, group, the, predominant, worldwide, usage, of, the, term, in, english, is, in, the, discipline, of, anthropology, its, definition, is, contested, in, part, due, to, conflicting, theoretical, understandings, of, social, and, kinship, structures, and, also, reflecting, the, problematic, application, of, this, concept, to, extremely, diverse, human, societies, the, concept, is, often, contrasted, by, anthropologists, with, other, social, and, kinship, groups, being, hierarchically, larger, than, a, lineage, or, clan, but, smaller, than, a, chiefdom, ethnicity, nation, or, state, these, terms, are, similarly, disputed, in, some, cases, tribes, have, legal, recognition, and, some, degree, of, political, autonomy, from, national, or, federal, government, but, this, legalistic, usage, of, the, term, may, conflict, with, anthropological, definitions, in, the, united, states, native, american, tribes, are, legally, considered, to, have, domestic, dependent, nation, status, within, the, territorial, united, states, with, a, government, to, government, relationship, with, the, federal, government, the, modern, english, word, tribe, stems, from, middle, english, tribu, which, ultimately, derives, from, latin, tribus, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, it, remains, unclear, if, this, form, is, the, result, of, a, borrowing, from, a, romance, language, source, such, as, old, french, tribu, or, if, the, form, is, a, result, of, borrowing, directly, from, latin, the, middle, english, plural, tribuz, 1250, may, be, a, direct, representation, of, latin, plural, trib, s, modern, english, tribe, may, also, be, a, result, of, a, common, pattern, wherein, english, borrows, nouns, directly, from, latin, and, drops, suffixes, including, us, latin, tribus, is, generally, held, by, linguists, to, be, a, compound, formed, from, two, elements, tri, three, and, bhu, bu, fu, a, verbal, root, meaning, to, be, latin, tribus, is, held, to, derive, from, the, proto, indo, european, compound, tri, d, h, u, o, rendered, in, three, tripartite, division, compare, with, umbrian, trifu, trinity, district, sanskrit, tr, dha, threefold, considerable, debate, has, accompanied, efforts, to, define, and, characterize, tribes, in, the, popular, imagination, tribes, reflect, a, primordial, social, structure, from, which, all, subsequent, civilizations, and, states, developed, anthropologist, elman, service, presented, a, system, of, classification, for, societies, in, all, human, cultures, based, on, the, evolution, of, social, inequality, and, the, role, of, the, state, this, system, of, classification, contains, four, categories, tribes, are, therefore, considered, to, be, a, political, unit, formed, from, an, organisation, of, families, including, clans, and, lineages, based, on, social, or, ideological, solidarity, membership, of, a, tribe, may, be, understood, as, being, based, on, factors, such, as, kinship, clan, ethnicity, race, language, dwelling, place, political, group, religious, beliefs, oral, tradition, and, or, cultural, practices, archaeologists, continue, to, explore, the, development, of, pre, state, tribes, current, research, suggests, that, tribal, structures, constituted, one, type, of, adaptation, to, situations, providing, plentiful, yet, unpredictable, resources, such, structures, proved, flexible, enough, to, coordinate, production, and, distribution, of, food, in, times, of, scarcity, without, limiting, or, constraining, people, during, times, of, surplus, anthropologist, morton, fried, argued, in, 1967, that, bands, organized, into, tribes, in, order, to, resist, the, violence, and, exploitation, of, early, kingdoms, and, states, he, wrote, in, fact, there, is, no, absolute, necessity, for, a, tribal, stage, as, defined, by, sahlins, and, service, no, necessity, that, is, for, such, a, stage, to, appear, in, the, transit, from, a, single, settlement, with, embedded, political, organization, to, a, complex, state, structured, polity, such, a, developmental, process, could, have, gone, on, within, a, unit, that, we, may, conceptualize, as, a, city, state, such, a, unit, as, jericho, might, have, become, in, its, later, stages, tribalism, can, be, viewed, as, reaction, to, the, formation, of, complex, political, structure, rather, than, a, necessary, preliminary, stage, in, its, evolution, the, term, tribe, was, in, common, use, in, the, field, of, anthropology, until, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, continued, use, of, the, term, has, attracted, controversy, among, anthropologists, and, other, academics, active, in, the, social, sciences, with, scholars, of, anthropological, and, ethnohistorical, research, challenging, the, utility, of, the, concept, in, 1970, anthropologist, j, clyde, mitchell, wrote, despite, the, membership, boundaries, for, a, tribe, being, conceptually, simple, in, reality, they, are, often, vague, and, subject, to, change, over, time, in, his, 1975, study, the, notion, of, the, tribe, fried, provided, numerous, examples, of, tribes, that, encompassed, members, who, spoke, different, languages, and, practiced, different, rituals, or, who, shared, languages, and, rituals, with, members, of, other, tribes, similarly, he, provided, examples, of, tribes, in, which, people, followed, different, political, leaders, or, followed, the, same, leaders, as, members, of, other, tribes, he, concluded, that, tribes, in, general, are, characterized, by, fluid, boundaries, heterogeneity, and, dynamism, and, are, not, parochial, part, of, the, difficulty, with, the, term, is, that, it, seeks, to, construct, and, apply, a, common, conceptual, framework, across, diverse, cultures, and, peoples, different, anthropologists, studying, different, peoples, therefore, draw, conflicting, conclusions, about, the, nature, structure, and, practices, of, tribes, writing, on, the, kurdish, peoples, anthropologist, martin, van, bruinessen, argued, the, terms, of, standard, anthropological, usage, tribe, clan, and, lineage, appear, to, be, a, straitjacket, that, ill, fits, the, social, reality, of, kurdistan, there, are, further, negative, connotations, of, the, term, tribe, that, have, reduced, its, use, writing, in, 2013, scholar, matthew, ortoleva, noted, that, like, the, word, indian, ribe, is, a, word, that, has, connotations, of, colonialism, survival, international, says, it, is, important, to, make, the, distinction, between, tribal, and, indigenous, because, tribal, peoples, have, a, special, status, acknowledged, in, international, law, as, well, as, problems, in, addition, to, those, faced, by, the, wider, category, of, indigenous, peoples, few, tribes, today, remain, isolated, from, the, development, of, the, modern, state, system, tribes, have, lost, their, legitimacy, to, conduct, traditional, functions, such, as, tithing, delivering, justice, and, defending, territory, with, these, being, replaced, by, states, functions, and, institutions, such, as, taxation, law, courts, and, the, military, most, have, suffered, decline, and, loss, of, cultural, identity, some, have, adapted, to, the, new, political, context, and, transformed, their, culture, and, practices, in, order, to, survive, whilst, others, have, secured, legal, rights, and, protections, fried, proposed, that, most, surviving, tribes, do, not, have, their, origin, in, pre, state, tribes, but, rather, in, pre, state, bands, such, secondary, tribes, he, suggested, developed, as, modern, products, of, state, expansion, bands, comprise, small, mobile, and, fluid, social, formations, with, weak, leadership, they, do, not, generate, surpluses, pay, no, taxes, and, support, no, standing, army, fried, argued, that, secondary, tribes, develop, in, one, of, two, ways, first, states, could, set, them, up, as, means, to, extend, administrative, and, economic, influence, in, their, hinterland, where, direct, political, control, costs, too, much, states, would, encourage, or, require, people, on, their, frontiers, to, form, more, clearly, bounded, and, centralized, polities, because, such, polities, could, begin, producing, surpluses, and, taxes, and, would, have, a, leadership, responsive, to, the, needs, of, neighboring, states, the, so, called, tribes, of, the, united, states, or, british, india, provide, good, examples, of, this, the, british, favored, the, label, aboriginal, tribe, for, some, communities, india, adopted, a, republican, constitution, in, 1950, after, three, years, of, debate, in, its, constituent, assembly, during, the, debate, jaipal, singh, a, member, of, munda, tribe, from, central, india, advocated, for, special, provisions, for, the, adibasi, a, translation, into, hindi, of, aboriginal, his, arguments, proved, persuasive, these, communities, were, to, have, seats, in, the, legislatures, and, positions, in, government, employment, reserved, for, them, each, of, the, assembly, members, prepared, a, list, of, communities, that, deserved, special, protections, these, names, were, listed, in, a, schedule, appendix, to, the, constitution, so, these, came, to, be, called, the, scheduled, tribes, often, abbreviated, to, st, second, bands, could, form, secondary, tribes, as, a, means, to, defend, against, state, expansion, members, of, bands, would, form, more, clearly, bounded, and, centralized, polities, because, such, polities, could, begin, producing, surpluses, that, could, support, a, standing, army, that, could, fight, against, states, and, they, would, have, a, leadership, that, could, co, ordinate, economic, production, and, military, activities, in, the, native, american, tribes, of, north, america, tribes, are, considered, sovereign, nations, that, have, retained, their, sovereignty, or, been, granted, legal, recognition, by, the, federal, government
