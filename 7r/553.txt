precedent, is, a, principle, or, rule, established, in, a, legal, case, that, becomes, authoritative, to, a, court, or, other, tribunal, when, deciding, subsequent, cases, with, similar, legal, issues, or, facts, the, legal, doctrine, stating, that, courts, should, follow, precedent, is, called, stare, decisis, a, latin, phrase, with, the, literal, meaning, to, stand, by, things, decided, common, law, legal, systems, often, view, precedent, as, binding, or, persuasive, while, civil, law, systems, do, not, common, law, systems, aim, for, similar, facts, to, yield, similar, and, predictable, outcomes, and, observing, precedent, when, making, decisions, is, the, mechanism, to, achieve, that, goal, common, law, precedent, is, a, third, kind, of, law, on, equal, footing, with, statutory, law, that, is, statutes, and, codes, enacted, by, legislative, bodies, and, subordinate, legislation, that, is, regulations, promulgated, by, executive, branch, agencies, in, the, form, of, delegated, legislation, in, uk, parlance, or, regulatory, law, in, us, parlance, case, law, in, common, law, jurisdictions, is, the, set, of, decisions, of, adjudicatory, tribunals, or, other, rulings, that, can, be, cited, as, precedent, in, most, countries, including, most, european, countries, the, term, is, applied, to, any, set, of, rulings, on, law, which, is, guided, by, previous, rulings, for, example, previous, decisions, of, a, government, agency, essential, to, the, development, of, case, law, is, the, publication, and, indexing, of, decisions, for, use, by, lawyers, courts, and, the, general, public, in, the, form, of, law, reports, a, precedent, is, a, historical, setting, example, for, the, future, though, at, varying, levels, of, authority, as, discussed, throughout, this, article, some, become, leading, cases, or, landmark, decisions, that, are, cited, especially, often, generally, speaking, a, legal, precedent, may, be, in, contrast, civil, law, systems, adhere, to, a, legal, positivism, where, past, decisions, do, not, usually, have, the, precedential, binding, effect, that, they, have, in, common, law, decision, making, the, judicial, review, practiced, by, constitutional, courts, can, be, regarded, as, a, notable, exception, stare, decisis, s, t, r, r, i, d, s, a, s, s, s, t, r, e, is, a, legal, principle, by, which, judges, are, obligated, to, respect, the, precedent, established, by, prior, decisions, the, words, originate, from, the, phrasing, of, the, principle, in, the, latin, maxim, stare, decisis, et, non, quieta, movere, to, stand, by, decisions, and, not, disturb, the, undisturbed, in, a, legal, context, this, means, that, courts, should, abide, by, precedent, and, not, disturb, settled, matters, the, principle, can, be, divided, into, two, components, the, second, principle, regarding, persuasive, precedent, reflects, the, broad, precedent, guidance, a, court, may, draw, upon, in, reaching, all, of, its, decisions, in, the, common, law, tradition, courts, decide, the, law, applicable, to, a, case, by, interpreting, statutes, and, applying, precedent, which, record, how, and, why, prior, cases, have, been, decided, unlike, most, civil, law, systems, common, law, systems, follow, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, by, which, most, courts, are, bound, by, their, own, previous, decisions, in, similar, cases, and, all, lower, courts, should, make, decisions, consistent, with, previous, decisions, of, higher, courts, for, example, in, england, and, wales, the, high, court, and, the, court, of, appeal, are, each, bound, by, their, own, previous, decisions, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, kingdom, is, able, to, deviate, from, its, earlier, decisions, although, in, practice, it, rarely, does, so, a, lower, court, may, not, rule, against, a, binding, precedent, even, if, the, lower, court, feels, that, the, precedent, is, wrong, even, if, an, intermediate, judge, issues, a, ruling, inconsistent, with, existing, or, subsequent, precedent, if, the, case, is, not, vacated, on, appeal, the, decision, will, stand, if, the, court, believes, that, developments, or, trends, in, legal, reasoning, render, the, precedent, unhelpful, and, wishes, to, evade, it, and, help, the, law, evolve, the, court, may, either, hold, that, the, precedent, is, inconsistent, with, subsequent, authority, or, that, the, precedent, should, be, distinguished, by, some, material, difference, between, the, facts, of, the, cases, if, that, decision, goes, to, appeal, the, appellate, court, will, have, the, opportunity, to, review, both, the, precedent, and, the, case, under, appeal, perhaps, overruling, the, previous, case, law, by, setting, a, new, precedent, of, higher, authority, this, may, happen, several, times, as, the, case, works, its, way, through, successive, appeals, lord, denning, first, of, the, high, court, of, justice, later, of, the, court, of, appeal, provided, a, famous, example, of, this, evolutionary, process, in, his, development, of, the, concept, of, estoppel, starting, in, the, high, trees, case, central, london, property, trust, ltd, v, high, trees, house, ltd, k, b, 130, judges, may, refer, to, various, types, of, persuasive, authority, to, reach, a, decision, in, a, case, widely, cited, nonbinding, sources, include, legal, encyclopedias, such, as, corpus, juris, secundum, and, halsbury, s, laws, of, england, or, the, published, work, of, the, law, commission, or, the, american, law, institute, some, bodies, are, given, statutory, powers, to, issue, guidance, with, persuasive, authority, or, similar, statutory, effect, such, as, the, highway, code, in, federal, or, multijurisdictional, law, systems, conflicts, may, exist, between, the, various, lower, appellate, courts, sometimes, these, differences, may, not, be, resolved, and, distinguishing, how, the, law, is, applied, in, one, district, province, division, or, appellate, department, may, be, necessary, usually, only, an, appeal, accepted, by, the, court, of, last, resort, will, resolve, such, differences, and, for, many, reasons, such, appeals, are, often, not, granted, any, court, may, seek, to, distinguish, its, present, case, from, that, of, a, binding, precedent, to, reach, a, different, conclusion, the, validity, of, such, a, distinction, may, or, may, not, be, accepted, on, appeal, an, appellate, court, may, also, propound, an, entirely, new, and, different, analysis, from, that, of, junior, courts, and, may, or, may, not, be, bound, by, its, own, previous, decisions, or, in, any, case, may, distinguish, the, decisions, based, on, significant, differences, in, the, facts, applicable, to, each, case, or, a, court, may, view, the, matter, before, it, as, one, of, first, impression, not, governed, by, any, controlling, precedent, when, various, members, of, a, multi, judge, court, write, separate, opinions, the, reasoning, may, differ, only, the, ratio, decidendi, of, the, majority, becomes, binding, precedent, for, example, if, a, 12, member, court, splits, 5, 2, 3, 2, in, four, different, opinions, on, several, different, issues, whatever, reasoning, commands, seven, votes, on, each, specific, issue, becomes, precedent, and, the, seven, judge, majorities, may, differ, issue, to, issue, all, may, be, cited, as, persuasive, though, of, course, opinions, that, concur, in, the, majority, result, are, more, persuasive, than, dissents, quite, apart, from, the, rules, of, precedent, the, weight, actually, given, to, any, reported, opinion, may, depend, on, the, reputation, of, both, the, court, and, the, judges, with, respect, to, the, specific, issue, for, example, in, the, united, states, the, second, circuit, new, york, and, surrounding, states, is, especially, respected, in, commercial, and, securities, law, the, seventh, circuit, in, chicago, especially, judge, posner, is, highly, regarded, on, antitrust, and, the, district, of, columbia, circuit, is, highly, regarded, on, administrative, law, the, doctrine, of, vertical, precedent, states, that, each, court, is, bound, by, the, decisions, of, higher, courts, in, its, jurisdictional, area, or, tribunal, hierarchy, generally, a, common, law, court, system, has, trial, courts, intermediate, appellate, courts, and, a, supreme, court, thus, the, lower, courts, are, bound, to, obey, precedent, established, by, the, appellate, court, for, their, jurisdiction, and, all, supreme, court, precedent, the, supreme, court, of, california, s, explanation, of, this, principle, is, that, nder, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, all, tribunals, exercising, inferior, jurisdiction, are, required, to, follow, decisions, of, courts, exercising, superior, jurisdiction, otherwise, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, makes, no, sense, the, decisions, of, this, court, are, binding, upon, and, must, be, followed, by, all, the, state, courts, of, california, decisions, of, every, division, of, the, district, courts, of, appeal, are, binding, upon, all, the, justice, and, municipal, courts, and, upon, all, the, superior, courts, of, this, state, and, this, is, so, whether, or, not, the, superior, court, is, acting, as, a, trial, or, appellate, court, courts, exercising, inferior, jurisdiction, must, accept, the, law, declared, by, courts, of, superior, jurisdiction, it, is, not, their, function, to, attempt, to, overrule, decisions, of, a, higher, court, the, doctrine, stating, that, a, judge, is, bound, by, or, at, least, should, respect, previous, decisions, by, the, same, court, is, called, horizontal, stare, decisis, for, example, in, the, united, states, federal, court, system, the, intermediate, appellate, courts, are, divided, into, thirteen, circuits, each, covering, some, range, of, territory, ranging, in, size, from, the, district, of, columbia, alone, and, up, to, seven, states, each, panel, of, judges, on, the, court, of, appeals, for, a, circuit, is, bound, to, obey, the, prior, appellate, decisions, of, the, same, circuit, precedent, of, a, united, states, court, of, appeals, may, be, overruled, only, by, the, court, en, banc, that, is, a, session, of, all, the, active, appellate, judges, of, the, circuit, or, by, the, united, states, supreme, court, not, simply, by, a, different, three, judge, panel, in, federal, systems, the, division, between, federal, and, state, law, may, result, in, complex, interactions, in, the, united, states, state, courts, are, not, considered, inferior, to, federal, courts, but, rather, constitute, a, parallel, court, system, in, practice, however, judges, in, one, system, will, almost, always, choose, to, follow, relevant, case, law, in, the, other, system, to, prevent, divergent, results, and, to, minimize, forum, shopping, precedent, that, must, be, applied, or, followed, is, known, as, binding, precedent, alternately, metaphorically, precedent, mandatory, or, binding, authority, etc, under, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, a, lower, court, must, honor, findings, of, law, made, by, a, higher, court, that, is, within, the, appeals, path, of, cases, the, court, hears, in, state, and, federal, courts, in, the, united, states, of, america, jurisdiction, is, often, divided, geographically, among, local, trial, courts, several, of, which, fall, under, the, territory, of, a, regional, appeals, court, all, appellate, courts, fall, under, a, highest, court, sometimes, but, not, always, called, a, supreme, court, by, definition, decisions, of, lower, courts, are, not, binding, on, courts, higher, in, the, system, nor, are, appeals, court, decisions, binding, on, local, courts, that, fall, under, a, different, appeals, court, further, courts, must, follow, their, own, proclamations, of, law, made, earlier, on, other, cases, and, honor, rulings, made, by, other, courts, in, disputes, among, the, parties, before, them, pertaining, to, the, same, pattern, of, facts, or, events, unless, they, have, a, strong, reason, to, change, these, rulings, in, law, a, binding, precedent, also, known, as, a, mandatory, precedent, or, binding, authority, is, a, precedent, which, must, be, followed, by, all, lower, courts, under, common, law, legal, systems, in, english, law, it, is, usually, created, by, the, decision, of, a, higher, court, such, as, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, kingdom, which, took, over, the, judicial, functions, of, the, house, of, lords, in, 2009, in, civil, law, and, pluralist, systems, precedent, is, not, binding, but, case, law, is, taken, into, account, by, the, courts, binding, precedent, relies, on, the, legal, principle, of, stare, decisis, stare, decisis, means, to, stand, by, things, decided, it, ensures, certainty, and, consistency, in, the, application, of, law, existing, binding, precedent, from, past, cases, are, applied, in, principle, to, new, situations, by, analogy, one, law, professor, has, described, mandatory, precedent, as, follows, given, a, determination, as, to, the, governing, jurisdiction, a, court, is, bound, to, follow, a, precedent, of, that, jurisdiction, only, if, it, is, directly, in, point, in, the, strongest, sense, directly, in, point, means, that, 1, the, question, resolved, in, the, precedent, case, is, the, same, as, the, question, to, be, resolved, in, the, pending, case, 2, resolution, of, that, question, was, necessary, to, the, disposition, of, the, precedent, case, 3, the, significant, facts, of, the, precedent, case, are, also, presented, in, the, pending, case, and, 4, no, additional, facts, appear, in, the, pending, case, that, might, be, treated, as, significant, in, extraordinary, circumstances, a, higher, court, may, overturn, or, overrule, mandatory, precedent, but, will, often, attempt, to, distinguish, the, precedent, before, overturning, it, thereby, limiting, the, scope, of, the, precedent, under, the, u, s, legal, system, courts, are, set, up, in, a, hierarchy, at, the, top, of, the, federal, or, national, system, is, the, supreme, court, and, underneath, are, lower, federal, courts, the, state, court, systems, have, hierarchical, structures, similar, to, that, of, the, federal, system, the, u, s, supreme, court, has, final, authority, on, questions, about, the, meaning, of, federal, law, including, the, u, s, constitution, for, example, when, the, supreme, court, says, that, the, first, amendment, applies, in, a, specific, way, to, suits, for, slander, then, every, court, is, bound, by, that, precedent, in, its, interpretation, of, the, first, amendment, as, it, applies, to, suits, for, slander, if, a, lower, court, judge, disagrees, with, a, higher, court, precedent, on, what, the, first, amendment, should, mean, the, lower, court, judge, must, rule, according, to, the, binding, precedent, until, the, higher, court, changes, the, ruling, or, the, law, itself, is, changed, the, binding, precedent, is, authoritative, on, the, meaning, of, the, law, lower, courts, are, bound, by, the, precedent, set, by, higher, courts, within, their, region, thus, a, federal, district, court, that, falls, within, the, geographic, boundaries, of, the, third, circuit, court, of, appeals, the, mid, level, appeals, court, that, hears, appeals, from, district, court, decisions, from, delaware, new, jersey, pennsylvania, and, the, virgin, islands, is, bound, by, rulings, of, the, third, circuit, court, but, not, by, rulings, in, the, ninth, circuit, alaska, arizona, california, guam, hawaii, idaho, montana, nevada, northern, mariana, islands, oregon, and, washington, since, the, circuit, courts, of, appeals, have, jurisdiction, defined, by, geography, the, circuit, courts, of, appeals, can, interpret, the, law, how, they, want, so, long, as, there, is, no, binding, supreme, court, precedent, one, of, the, common, reasons, the, supreme, court, grants, certiorari, that, is, they, agree, to, hear, a, case, is, if, there, is, a, conflict, among, the, circuit, courts, as, to, the, meaning, of, a, federal, law, there, are, three, elements, needed, for, a, precedent, to, work, firstly, the, hierarchy, of, the, courts, needs, to, be, accepted, and, an, efficient, system, of, law, reporting, a, balance, must, be, struck, between, the, need, on, one, side, for, the, legal, certainty, resulting, from, the, binding, effect, of, previous, decisions, and, on, the, other, side, the, avoidance, of, undue, restriction, on, the, proper, development, of, the, law, judges, are, bound, by, the, law, of, binding, precedent, in, england, and, wales, and, other, common, law, jurisdictions, this, is, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, english, legal, system, in, other, countries, particularly, in, mainland, europe, civil, law, means, that, judges, take, case, law, into, account, in, a, similar, way, but, are, not, obliged, to, do, so, and, are, required, to, consider, the, precedent, in, terms, of, principle, their, fellow, judges, decisions, may, be, persuasive, but, are, not, binding, under, the, english, legal, system, judges, are, not, necessarily, entitled, to, make, their, own, decisions, about, the, development, or, interpretations, of, the, law, they, may, be, bound, by, a, decision, reached, in, a, previous, case, two, facts, are, crucial, to, determining, whether, a, precedent, is, binding, in, a, conflict, of, laws, situation, jus, cogens, norms, erga, omnes, and, principles, of, the, common, law, such, as, in, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, to, a, varying, degree, in, different, jurisdictions, are, deemed, overriding, which, means, they, are, used, to, read, down, legislation, that, is, giving, them, a, particular, purposive, interpretation, for, example, applying, european, court, of, human, rights, jurisprudence, of, courts, case, law, super, stare, decisis, is, a, term, used, for, important, precedent, that, is, resistant, or, immune, from, being, overturned, without, regard, to, whether, correctly, decided, in, the, first, place, it, may, be, viewed, as, one, extreme, in, a, range, of, precedential, power, or, alternatively, to, express, a, belief, or, a, critique, of, that, belief, that, some, decisions, should, not, be, overturned, in, 1976, richard, posner, and, william, landes, coined, the, term, super, precedent, in, an, article, they, wrote, about, testing, theories, of, precedent, by, counting, citations, posner, and, landes, used, this, term, to, describe, the, influential, effect, of, a, cited, decision, the, term, super, precedent, later, became, associated, with, different, issue, the, difficulty, of, overturning, a, decision, in, 1992, rutgers, professor, earl, maltz, criticized, the, supreme, court, s, decision, in, planned, parenthood, v, casey, for, endorsing, the, idea, that, if, one, side, can, take, control, of, the, court, on, an, issue, of, major, national, importance, as, in, roe, v, wade, that, side, can, protect, its, position, from, being, reversed, by, a, kind, of, super, stare, decisis, the, controversial, idea, that, some, decisions, are, virtually, immune, from, being, overturned, regardless, of, whether, they, were, decided, correctly, in, the, first, place, is, the, idea, to, which, the, term, super, stare, decisis, now, usually, refers, the, concept, of, super, stare, decisis, or, super, precedent, was, mentioned, during, the, hearings, of, chief, justice, john, roberts, and, justice, samuel, alito, before, the, senate, judiciary, committee, prior, to, the, commencement, of, the, roberts, hearings, the, committee, chair, senator, arlen, specter, of, pennsylvania, wrote, an, op, ed, in, the, new, york, times, referring, to, roe, as, a, super, precedent, he, revisited, this, concept, during, the, hearings, but, neither, roberts, nor, alito, endorsed, the, term, or, the, concept, persuasive, precedent, also, persuasive, authority, is, precedent, or, other, legal, writing, that, is, not, binding, precedent, but, that, is, useful, or, relevant, and, that, may, guide, the, judge, in, making, the, decision, in, a, current, case, persuasive, precedent, includes, cases, decided, by, lower, courts, by, peer, or, higher, courts, from, other, geographic, jurisdictions, cases, made, in, other, parallel, systems, for, example, military, courts, administrative, courts, indigenous, tribal, courts, state, courts, versus, federal, courts, in, the, united, states, statements, made, in, dicta, treatises, or, academic, law, reviews, and, in, some, exceptional, circumstances, cases, of, other, nations, treaties, world, judicial, bodies, etc, in, a, case, of, first, impression, courts, often, rely, on, persuasive, precedent, from, courts, in, other, jurisdictions, that, have, previously, dealt, with, similar, issues, persuasive, precedent, may, become, binding, through, its, adoption, by, a, higher, court, in, civil, law, and, pluralist, systems, as, under, scots, law, precedent, is, not, binding, but, case, law, is, taken, into, account, by, the, courts, a, court, may, consider, the, ruling, of, a, higher, court, that, is, not, binding, for, example, a, district, court, in, the, united, states, first, circuit, could, consider, a, ruling, made, by, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, ninth, circuit, as, persuasive, authority, courts, may, consider, rulings, made, in, other, courts, that, are, of, equivalent, authority, in, the, legal, system, for, example, an, appellate, court, for, one, district, could, consider, a, ruling, issued, by, an, appeals, court, in, another, district, courts, may, consider, obiter, dicta, in, the, opinions, of, higher, courts, the, dicta, of, a, higher, court, though, not, binding, will, often, be, persuasive, to, lower, courts, the, phrase, obiter, dicta, is, usually, translated, as, other, things, said, but, due, to, the, high, number, of, judges, and, individual, concurring, opinions, it, is, often, hard, to, distinguish, from, the, ratio, decidendi, reason, for, the, decision, for, these, reasons, the, obiter, dicta, may, often, be, taken, into, consideration, by, a, court, a, litigant, may, also, consider, obiter, dicta, if, a, court, has, previously, signaled, that, a, particular, legal, argument, is, weak, and, may, even, warrant, sanctions, if, repeated, a, case, decided, by, a, multijudge, panel, could, result, in, a, split, decision, while, only, the, majority, opinion, is, considered, precedential, an, outvoted, judge, can, still, publish, a, dissenting, opinion, common, patterns, for, dissenting, opinions, include, a, judge, in, a, subsequent, case, particularly, in, a, different, jurisdiction, could, find, the, dissenting, judge, s, reasoning, persuasive, in, the, jurisdiction, of, the, original, decision, however, a, judge, should, only, overturn, the, holding, of, a, court, lower, or, equivalent, in, the, hierarchy, a, district, court, for, example, could, not, rely, on, a, supreme, court, dissent, as, a, basis, to, depart, from, the, reasoning, of, the, majority, opinion, however, lower, courts, occasionally, cite, dissents, either, for, a, limiting, principle, on, the, majority, or, for, propositions, that, are, not, stated, in, the, majority, opinion, and, not, inconsistent, with, that, majority, or, to, explain, a, disagreement, with, the, majority, and, to, urge, reform, while, following, the, majority, in, the, outcome, courts, may, consider, the, writings, of, eminent, legal, scholars, in, treatises, restatements, of, the, law, and, law, reviews, the, extent, to, which, judges, find, these, types, of, writings, persuasive, will, vary, widely, with, elements, such, as, the, reputation, of, the, author, and, the, relevance, of, the, argument, in, the, united, states, every, state, attorney, general, is, permitted, to, issue, advisory, opinions, on, questions, of, law, it, is, a, process, that, has, its, origins, in, the, english, common, law, most, state, attorney, opinions, address, issues, of, government, finance, or, the, authority, of, political, bodies, within, the, state, often, these, opinions, are, the, only, available, authority, interpreting, rarely, litigated, statutes, and, constitutional, provisions, by, and, large, courts, treat, state, attorney, general, opinions, as, persuasive, authority, the, opinions, lack, the, force, of, law, that, statutes, and, judicial, opinions, have, but, they, still, have, the, potential, to, act, as, a, sort, of, pseudo, law, if, they, constrain, the, activities, of, public, officials, or, the, public, oftentimes, this, effect, depends, on, the, formality, of, the, opinion, opinions, can, be, either, formal, meaning, they, are, published, or, informal, meaning, that, they, are, sent, directly, to, the, opinion, requestor, although, formal, opinions, can, act, as, a, sort, of, binding, precedent, when, they, answer, legal, questions, that, a, court, has, not, either, form, of, opinion, may, act, as, a, source, of, law, if, they, have, a, direct, effect, on, the, administration, of, government, the, courts, of, england, and, wales, are, free, to, consider, decisions, of, other, jurisdictions, and, give, them, whatever, persuasive, weight, the, english, court, sees, fit, even, though, these, other, decisions, are, not, binding, precedent, jurisdictions, that, are, closer, to, modern, english, common, law, are, more, likely, to, be, given, persuasive, weight, for, example, commonwealth, states, such, as, canada, australia, or, new, zealand, persuasive, weight, might, be, given, to, other, common, law, courts, such, as, from, the, united, states, most, often, where, the, american, courts, have, been, particularly, innovative, e, g, in, product, liability, and, certain, areas, of, contract, law, in, the, united, states, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, concept, of, a, u, s, court, considering, foreign, law, or, precedent, has, been, considered, controversial, by, some, parties, the, supreme, court, splits, on, this, issue, this, critique, is, recent, as, in, the, early, history, of, the, united, states, citation, of, english, authority, was, ubiquitous, one, of, the, first, acts, of, many, of, the, new, state, legislatures, was, to, adopt, the, body, of, english, common, law, into, the, law, of, the, state, citation, to, english, cases, was, common, through, the, 19th, and, well, into, the, 20th, centuries, even, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, it, is, relatively, uncontroversial, for, american, state, courts, to, rely, on, english, decisions, for, matters, of, pure, common, i, e, judge, made, law, within, the, federal, legal, systems, of, several, common, law, countries, and, most, especially, the, united, states, it, is, relatively, common, for, the, distinct, lower, level, judicial, systems, e, g, state, courts, in, the, united, states, and, australia, provincial, courts, in, canada, to, regard, the, decisions, of, other, jurisdictions, within, the, same, country, as, persuasive, precedent, particularly, in, the, united, states, the, adoption, of, a, legal, doctrine, by, a, large, number, of, other, state, judiciaries, is, regarded, as, highly, persuasive, evidence, that, such, doctrine, is, preferred, a, good, example, is, the, adoption, in, tennessee, of, comparative, negligence, replacing, contributory, negligence, as, a, complete, bar, to, recovery, by, the, 1992, tennessee, supreme, court, decision, mcintyre, v, balentine, by, this, point, all, us, jurisdictions, save, tennessee, five, other, states, and, the, district, of, columbia, had, adopted, comparative, negligence, schemes, moreover, in, american, law, the, erie, doctrine, requires, federal, courts, sitting, in, diversity, actions, to, apply, state, substantive, law, but, in, a, manner, consistent, with, how, the, court, believes, the, state, s, highest, court, would, rule, in, that, case, since, such, decisions, are, not, binding, on, state, courts, but, are, often, very, well, reasoned, and, useful, state, courts, cite, federal, interpretations, of, state, law, fairly, often, as, persuasive, precedent, although, it, is, also, fairly, common, for, a, state, high, court, to, reject, a, federal, court, s, interpretation, of, its, jurisprudence, nonpublication, of, opinions, or, unpublished, opinions, are, those, decisions, of, courts, that, are, not, available, for, citation, as, precedent, because, the, judges, making, the, opinion, deem, the, cases, as, having, less, precedential, value, selective, publication, is, the, legal, process, which, a, judge, or, justices, of, a, court, decide, whether, a, decision, is, to, be, or, not, published, in, a, reporter, unpublished, federal, appellate, decisions, are, published, in, the, federal, appendix, depublication, is, the, power, of, a, court, to, make, a, previously, published, order, or, opinion, unpublished, litigation, that, is, settled, out, of, court, generates, no, written, decision, thus, has, no, precedential, effect, as, one, practical, effect, the, u, s, department, of, justice, settles, many, cases, against, the, federal, government, simply, to, avoid, creating, adverse, precedent, several, rules, may, cause, a, decision, to, apply, as, narrow, precedent, to, preclude, future, legal, positions, of, the, specific, parties, to, a, case, even, if, a, decision, is, non, precedential, with, respect, to, all, other, parties, once, a, case, is, decided, the, same, plaintiff, cannot, sue, the, same, defendant, again, on, any, claim, arising, out, of, the, same, facts, the, law, requires, plaintiffs, to, put, all, issues, on, the, table, in, a, single, case, not, split, the, case, for, example, in, a, case, of, an, auto, accident, the, plaintiff, cannot, sue, first, for, property, damage, and, then, personal, injury, in, a, separate, case, this, is, called, res, judicata, or, claim, preclusion, res, judicata, is, the, traditional, name, going, back, centuries, the, name, shifted, to, claim, preclusion, in, the, united, states, over, the, late, 20th, century, claim, preclusion, applies, regardless, of, the, plaintiff, wins, or, loses, the, earlier, case, even, if, the, later, case, raises, a, different, legal, theory, even, the, second, claim, is, unknown, at, the, time, of, the, first, case, exceptions, are, extremely, limited, for, example, if, the, two, claims, for, relief, must, necessarily, be, brought, in, different, courts, for, example, one, claim, might, be, exclusively, federal, and, the, other, exclusively, state, once, a, case, is, finally, decided, any, issues, decided, in, the, previous, case, may, be, binding, against, the, party, who, lost, the, issue, in, later, cases, even, in, cases, involving, other, parties, for, example, if, a, first, case, decides, that, a, party, was, negligent, then, other, plaintiffs, may, rely, on, that, earlier, determination, in, later, cases, and, need, not, reprove, the, issue, of, negligence, for, another, example, if, a, patent, is, shown, to, be, invalid, in, a, case, against, one, accused, infringer, that, same, patent, is, invalid, against, all, other, accused, infringers, invalidity, need, not, be, reproven, again, limits, and, exceptions, on, this, principle, exist, the, principle, is, called, collateral, estoppel, or, issue, preclusion, within, a, single, case, once, there, has, been, a, first, appeal, both, the, lower, court, and, the, appellate, court, itself, will, not, further, review, the, same, issue, and, will, not, re, review, an, issue, that, could, have, been, appealed, in, the, first, appeal, exceptions, are, limited, to, three, exceptional, circumstances, 1, when, substantially, different, evidence, is, raised, at, a, subsequent, trial, 2, when, the, law, changes, after, the, first, appeal, for, example, by, a, decision, of, a, higher, court, or, 3, when, a, decision, is, clearly, erroneous, and, would, result, in, a, manifest, injustice, this, principle, is, called, law, of, the, case, on, many, questions, reasonable, people, may, differ, when, two, of, those, people, are, judges, the, tension, among, two, lines, of, precedent, may, be, resolved, as, follows, if, the, two, courts, are, in, separate, parallel, jurisdictions, there, is, no, conflict, and, two, lines, of, precedent, may, persist, courts, in, one, jurisdiction, are, influenced, by, decisions, in, others, and, notably, better, rules, may, be, adopted, over, time, courts, try, to, formulate, the, common, law, as, a, seamless, web, so, that, principles, in, one, area, of, the, law, apply, to, other, areas, however, this, principle, does, not, apply, uniformly, thus, a, word, may, have, different, definitions, in, different, areas, of, the, law, or, different, rules, may, apply, so, that, a, question, has, different, answers, in, different, legal, contexts, judges, try, to, minimize, these, conflicts, but, they, arise, from, time, to, time, and, under, principles, of, stare, decisis, may, persist, for, some, time, a, matter, of, first, impression, also, known, as, an, issue, of, first, impression, case, of, first, impression, or, in, latin, as, primae, impressionis, is, an, issue, where, the, parties, disagree, on, what, the, applicable, law, is, and, there, is, no, prior, binding, authority, so, that, the, matter, has, to, be, decided, for, the, first, time, a, first, impression, case, may, be, a, first, impression, in, only, a, particular, jurisdiction, by, definition, a, case, of, first, impression, cannot, be, decided, by, precedent, since, there, is, no, precedent, for, the, court, to, follow, the, court, uses, the, plain, language, and, legislative, history, of, any, statute, that, must, be, interpreted, holdings, of, other, jurisdictions, persuasive, authority, and, analogies, from, prior, rulings, by, other, courts, which, may, be, higher, peers, or, lower, courts, in, the, hierarchy, or, from, other, jurisdictions, commentaries, and, articles, by, legal, scholars, and, the, court, s, own, logic, and, sense, of, justice, the, different, roles, of, case, law, in, civil, law, and, common, law, traditions, create, differences, in, the, way, that, courts, render, decisions, common, law, courts, generally, explain, in, detail, the, legal, rationale, behind, their, decisions, with, citations, of, both, legislation, and, previous, relevant, judgments, and, often, an, exegesis, of, the, wider, legal, principles, these, are, called, ratio, decidendi, and, constitute, a, precedent, binding, on, other, courts, further, analyses, not, strictly, necessary, to, the, determination, of, the, current, case, are, called, obiter, dicta, which, have, persuasive, authority, but, are, not, technically, binding, by, contrast, decisions, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, are, generally, very, short, referring, only, to, statutes, not, very, analytical, and, fact, based, the, reason, for, this, difference, is, that, these, civil, law, jurisdictions, apply, legislative, positivism, a, form, of, legal, positivism, which, holds, that, legislation, is, the, only, valid, source, of, law, because, it, has, been, voted, on, democratically, thus, it, is, not, the, judiciary, s, role, to, create, law, but, rather, to, interpret, and, apply, statute, and, therefore, their, decisions, must, reflect, that, stare, decisis, is, not, usually, a, doctrine, used, in, civil, law, systems, because, it, violates, the, legislative, positivist, principle, that, only, the, legislature, may, make, law, instead, the, civil, law, system, relies, on, the, doctrine, of, jurisprudence, constante, according, to, which, if, a, court, has, adjudicated, a, consistent, line, of, cases, that, arrive, at, the, same, holdings, using, sound, reasoning, then, the, previous, decisions, are, highly, persuasive, but, not, controlling, on, issues, of, law, this, doctrine, is, similar, to, stare, decisis, insofar, as, it, dictates, that, a, court, s, decision, must, condone, a, cohesive, and, predictable, result, in, theory, lower, courts, are, generally, not, bound, by, the, precedents, of, higher, courts, in, practice, the, need, for, predictability, means, that, lower, courts, generally, defer, to, the, precedent, of, higher, courts, as, a, result, the, precedent, of, courts, of, last, resort, such, as, the, french, cassation, court, and, the, council, of, state, is, recognized, as, being, de, facto, binding, on, lower, courts, the, doctrine, of, jurisprudence, constante, also, influences, how, court, decisions, are, structured, in, general, court, decisions, of, common, law, jurisdictions, give, a, sufficient, ratio, decidendi, as, to, guide, future, courts, the, ratio, is, used, to, justify, a, court, decision, on, the, basis, of, previous, case, law, as, well, as, to, make, it, easier, to, use, the, decision, as, a, precedent, for, future, cases, by, contrast, court, decisions, in, some, civil, law, jurisdictions, most, prominently, france, tend, to, be, extremely, brief, mentioning, only, the, relevant, legislation, and, codal, provisions, and, not, going, into, the, ratio, decidendi, in, any, great, detail, this, is, the, result, of, the, legislative, positivist, view, that, the, court, is, only, interpreting, the, legislature, s, intent, and, therefore, detailed, exposition, is, unnecessary, because, of, this, ratio, decidendi, is, carried, out, by, legal, academics, doctrinal, writers, who, provide, the, explanations, that, in, common, law, jurisdictions, would, be, provided, by, the, judges, themselves, in, other, civil, law, jurisdictions, such, as, the, german, speaking, countries, ratio, decidendi, tend, to, be, much, more, developed, than, in, france, and, courts, will, frequently, cite, previous, cases, and, doctrinal, writers, however, some, courts, such, as, german, courts, have, less, emphasis, on, the, particular, facts, of, the, case, than, common, law, courts, but, have, more, emphasis, on, the, discussion, of, various, doctrinal, arguments, and, on, finding, what, the, correct, interpretation, of, the, law, is, the, mixed, systems, of, the, nordic, countries, are, sometimes, considered, a, branch, of, the, civil, law, but, they, are, sometimes, counted, as, separate, from, the, civil, law, tradition, in, sweden, for, instance, case, law, arguably, plays, a, more, important, role, than, in, some, of, the, continental, civil, law, systems, the, two, highest, courts, the, supreme, court, h, gsta, domstolen, and, the, supreme, administrative, court, h, gsta, f, rvaltningsdomstolen, have, the, right, to, set, precedent, which, has, persuasive, authority, on, all, future, application, of, the, law, appellate, courts, be, they, judicial, hovr, tter, or, administrative, kammarr, tter, may, also, issue, decisions, that, act, as, guides, for, the, application, of, the, law, but, these, decisions, are, persuasive, not, controlling, and, may, therefore, be, overturned, by, higher, courts, some, mixed, systems, such, as, scots, law, in, scotland, south, african, law, laws, of, the, philippines, and, the, law, of, quebec, and, louisiana, do, not, fit, into, the, civil, vs, common, law, dichotomy, because, they, mix, portions, of, both, such, systems, may, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, the, common, law, tradition, however, their, private, law, is, firmly, rooted, in, the, civil, law, tradition, because, of, their, position, between, the, two, main, systems, of, law, these, types, of, legal, systems, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, mixed, systems, of, law, louisiana, courts, for, instance, operate, under, both, stare, decisis, and, jurisprudence, constante, in, south, africa, the, precedent, of, higher, courts, is, absolutely, or, fully, binding, on, lower, courts, whereas, the, precedent, of, lower, courts, only, has, persuasive, authority, on, higher, courts, horizontally, precedent, is, prima, facie, or, presumptively, binding, between, courts, law, professors, in, common, law, traditions, play, a, much, smaller, role, in, developing, case, law, than, professors, in, civil, law, traditions, because, court, decisions, in, civil, law, traditions, are, brief, and, not, amenable, to, establishing, precedent, much, of, the, exposition, of, the, law, in, civil, law, traditions, is, done, by, academics, rather, than, by, judges, this, is, called, doctrine, and, may, be, published, in, treatises, or, in, journals, such, as, recueil, dalloz, in, france, historically, common, law, courts, relied, little, on, legal, scholarship, thus, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, it, was, very, rare, to, see, an, academic, writer, quoted, in, a, legal, decision, except, perhaps, for, the, academic, writings, of, prominent, judges, such, as, coke, and, blackstone, today, academic, writers, are, often, cited, in, legal, argument, and, decisions, as, persuasive, authority, often, they, are, cited, when, judges, are, attempting, to, implement, reasoning, that, other, courts, have, not, yet, adopted, or, when, the, judge, believes, the, academic, s, restatement, of, the, law, is, more, compelling, than, can, be, found, in, precedent, thus, common, law, systems, are, adopting, one, of, the, approaches, long, common, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, justice, louis, brandeis, in, a, heavily, footnoted, dissent, to, burnet, v, coronado, oil, gas, co, 285, u, s, 393, 405, 411, 1932, explained, citations, and, quotations, omitted, stare, decisis, is, not, a, universal, inexorable, command, the, rule, of, stare, decisis, though, one, tending, to, consistency, and, uniformity, of, decision, is, not, inflexible, whether, it, shall, be, followed, or, departed, from, is, a, question, entirely, within, the, discretion, of, the, court, which, is, again, called, upon, to, consider, a, question, once, decided, stare, decisis, is, usually, the, wise, policy, because, in, most, matters, it, is, more, important, that, the, applicable, rule, of, law, be, settled, than, that, it, be, settled, right, this, is, commonly, true, even, where, the, error, is, a, matter, of, serious, concern, provided, correction, can, be, had, by, legislation, but, in, cases, involving, the, federal, constitution, where, correction, through, legislative, action, is, practically, impossible, this, court, has, often, overruled, its, earlier, decisions, the, court, bows, to, the, lessons, of, experience, and, the, force, of, better, reasoning, recognizing, that, the, process, of, trial, and, error, so, fruitful, in, the, physical, sciences, is, appropriate, also, in, the, judicial, function, in, cases, involving, the, federal, constitution, the, position, of, this, court, is, unlike, that, of, the, highest, court, of, england, where, the, policy, of, stare, decisis, was, formulated, and, is, strictly, applied, to, all, classes, of, cases, parliament, is, free, to, correct, any, judicial, error, and, the, remedy, may, be, promptly, invoked, the, reasons, why, this, court, should, refuse, to, follow, an, earlier, constitutional, decision, which, it, deems, erroneous, are, particularly, strong, where, the, question, presented, is, one, of, applying, as, distinguished, from, what, may, accurately, be, called, interpreting, the, constitution, in, the, cases, which, now, come, before, us, there, is, seldom, any, dispute, as, to, the, interpretation, of, any, provision, the, controversy, is, usually, over, the, application, to, existing, conditions, of, some, well, recognized, constitutional, limitation, this, is, strikingly, true, of, cases, under, the, due, process, clause, when, the, question, is, whether, a, statute, is, unreasonable, arbitrary, or, capricious, of, cases, under, the, equal, protection, clause, when, the, question, is, whether, there, is, any, reasonable, basis, for, the, classification, made, by, a, statute, and, of, cases, under, the, commerce, clause, when, the, question, is, whether, an, admitted, burden, laid, by, a, statute, upon, interstate, commerce, is, so, substantial, as, to, be, deemed, direct, in, his, landmark, dissent, in, burnet, brandeis, catalogued, the, court, s, actual, overruling, practices, in, such, a, powerful, manner, that, his, attendant, stare, decisis, analysis, immediately, assumed, canonical, authority, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, third, circuit, has, stated, a, judicial, precedent, attaches, a, specific, legal, consequence, to, a, detailed, set, of, facts, in, an, adjudged, case, or, judicial, decision, which, is, then, considered, as, furnishing, the, rule, for, the, determination, of, a, subsequent, case, involving, identical, or, similar, material, facts, and, arising, in, the, same, court, or, a, lower, court, in, the, judicial, hierarchy, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, ninth, circuit, has, stated, stare, decisis, is, the, policy, of, the, court, to, stand, by, precedent, the, term, is, but, an, abbreviation, of, stare, decisis, et, non, quieta, movere, to, stand, by, and, adhere, to, decisions, and, not, disturb, what, is, settled, consider, the, word, decisis, the, word, means, literally, and, legally, the, decision, under, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, a, case, is, important, only, for, what, it, decides, for, the, what, not, for, the, why, and, not, for, the, how, insofar, as, precedent, is, concerned, stare, decisis, is, important, only, for, the, decision, for, the, detailed, legal, consequence, following, a, detailed, set, of, facts, lord, hodge, of, the, uk, supreme, court, quoted, lord, wright, in, 1938, saying, hat, is, the, way, of, the, common, law, the, judges, preferring, to, go, from, case, to, case, like, the, ancient, mediterranean, mariners, hugging, the, coast, from, point, to, point, and, avoiding, the, dangers, of, the, open, sea, of, system, or, science, precedent, viewed, against, passing, time, can, serve, to, establish, trends, thus, indicating, the, next, logical, step, in, evolving, interpretations, of, the, law, for, instance, if, immigration, has, become, more, and, more, restricted, under, the, law, then, the, next, legal, decision, on, that, subject, may, serve, to, restrict, it, further, still, the, existence, of, submerged, precedent, reasoned, opinions, not, made, available, through, conventional, legal, research, sources, has, been, identified, as, a, potentially, distorting, force, in, the, evolution, of, law, scholars, have, recently, attempted, to, apply, network, theory, to, precedent, in, order, to, establish, which, precedent, is, most, important, or, authoritative, and, how, the, court, s, interpretations, and, priorities, have, changed, over, time, early, english, common, law, did, not, have, or, require, the, stare, decisis, doctrine, for, a, range, of, legal, and, technological, reasons, these, features, changed, over, time, opening, the, door, to, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, by, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, the, common, law, courts, had, absorbed, most, of, the, business, of, their, nonroyal, competitors, although, there, was, still, internal, competition, among, the, different, common, law, courts, themselves, during, the, nineteenth, century, legal, reform, movements, in, both, england, and, the, united, states, brought, this, to, an, end, as, well, by, merging, the, various, common, law, courts, into, a, unified, system, of, courts, with, a, formal, hierarchical, structure, this, and, the, advent, of, reliable, private, case, reporters, made, adherence, to, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, practical, and, the, practice, soon, evolved, of, holding, judges, to, be, bound, by, the, decisions, of, courts, of, superior, or, equal, status, in, their, jurisdiction, over, time, courts, in, the, united, states, and, especially, its, supreme, court, developed, a, large, body, of, judicial, decisions, which, are, called, precedents, these, ules, and, principles, established, in, prior, cases, inform, the, court, s, future, decisions, the, adherence, to, rules, and, principles, created, in, past, cases, as, a, foundation, for, future, decisions, by, the, courts, is, called, stare, decisis, the, united, states, supreme, court, considers, stare, decisis, not, only, as, an, important, doctrine, but, also, the, means, by, which, we, ensure, that, the, law, will, not, merely, change, erratically, but, will, develop, in, a, principled, and, intelligible, fashion, stare, decisis, aims, to, bolster, the, legitimacy, of, the, judicial, process, and, foster, the, rule, of, law, it, does, so, by, strengthening, stability, certainty, predictability, consistency, and, uniformity, in, the, application, of, the, law, to, cases, and, litigants, by, adhering, to, stare, decisis, the, supreme, court, attempts, to, preserve, its, role, as, a, careful, unbiased, and, predictable, decisionmaker, that, decides, cases, according, to, the, law, rather, than, the, justices, individual, policy, preferences, in, vasquez, v, hillery, 1986, the, supreme, court, stated, succinctly, that, stare, decisis, contributes, to, the, integrity, of, our, constitutional, system, of, government, both, in, appearance, and, in, fact, by, maintaining, the, notion, that, bedrock, principles, are, founded, in, the, law, rather, than, in, the, proclivities, of, individuals, stare, decisis, reduces, the, number, and, scope, of, legal, questions, that, the, court, must, resolve, in, litigation, it, is, therefore, a, time, saver, for, judges, and, litigants, once, a, court, has, settled, a, particular, question, of, law, it, has, established, a, precedent, thanks, to, stare, decisis, lawsuits, can, be, quickly, and, efficiently, dismissed, because, legal, battles, can, be, resolved, through, recourse, to, rules, and, principles, established, prior, decisions, stare, decisis, can, thus, encourage, parties, to, settle, cases, out, of, court, and, thereby, enhance, judicial, efficiency, several, supreme, court, decisions, were, overruled, by, subsequent, decisions, since, 1798, in, doing, so, the, supreme, court, has, time, and, time, again, made, several, statements, regarding, stare, decisis, the, following, is, a, non, exhaustive, list, of, examples, of, these, statements, stare, decisis, applies, to, the, holding, of, a, case, rather, than, to, obiter, dicta, things, said, by, the, way, as, the, united, states, supreme, court, has, put, it, dicta, may, be, followed, if, sufficiently, persuasive, but, are, not, binding, in, the, u, s, supreme, court, the, principle, of, stare, decisis, is, most, flexible, in, constitutional, cases, as, observed, by, justice, brandeis, in, his, landmark, dissent, in, burnet, as, quoted, at, length, above, for, example, in, the, years, 1946, 1992, the, u, s, supreme, court, reversed, itself, in, about, 130, cases, the, u, s, supreme, court, has, further, explained, as, follows, hen, convinced, of, former, error, this, court, has, never, felt, constrained, to, follow, precedent, in, constitutional, questions, where, correction, depends, upon, amendment, and, not, upon, legislative, action, this, court, throughout, its, history, has, freely, exercised, its, power, to, reexamine, the, basis, of, its, constitutional, decisions, the, court, has, stated, that, where, a, court, gives, multiple, reasons, for, a, given, result, each, alternative, reason, that, is, explicitly, labeled, by, the, court, as, an, independent, ground, for, the, decision, is, not, treated, as, simply, a, dictum, as, colin, starger, has, pointed, out, the, contemporary, rule, of, stare, decisis, descended, from, brandeis, s, landmark, dissent, in, burnet, would, later, split, into, strong, and, weak, conceptions, as, a, result, of, the, disagreement, between, chief, justice, william, rehnquist, and, associate, justice, thurgood, marshall, in, payne, v, tennessee, 1991, the, strong, conception, requires, a, special, justification, to, overrule, challenged, precedent, beyond, the, fact, the, precedent, was, wrongly, decided, while, the, weak, conception, holds, that, a, precedent, can, be, overruled, if, it, suffers, from, bad, reasoning, the, opinion, of, chief, justice, john, roberts, in, the, case, june, medical, services, llc, v, russo, provides, a, clear, statement, of, the, strong, conception, of, stare, decisis, in, this, case, the, court, upheld, by, a, 5, 4, margin, their, 2016, decision, in, whole, woman, s, health, v, hellerstedt, that, struck, down, a, similar, texas, law, requiring, doctors, who, perform, abortions, to, have, the, right, to, admit, patients, at, a, nearby, hospital, roberts, wrote, the, legal, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, requires, us, absent, special, circumstances, to, treat, like, cases, alike, roberts, provided, the, fifth, vote, to, uphold, the, 2016, decision, even, though, he, felt, it, was, wrongly, decided, the, doctrine, of, binding, precedent, or, stare, decisis, is, basic, to, the, english, legal, system, special, features, of, the, english, legal, system, include, the, following, the, british, house, of, lords, as, the, court, of, last, appeal, outside, scotland, before, it, was, replaced, by, the, uk, supreme, court, was, not, strictly, bound, to, always, follow, its, own, decisions, until, the, case, london, street, tramways, v, london, county, council, ac, 375, after, this, case, once, the, lords, had, given, a, ruling, on, a, point, of, law, the, matter, was, closed, unless, and, until, parliament, made, a, change, by, statute, this, is, the, most, strict, form, of, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, one, not, applied, previously, in, common, law, jurisdictions, where, there, was, somewhat, greater, flexibility, for, a, court, of, last, resort, to, review, its, own, precedent, this, situation, changed, however, after, the, house, of, lords, issued, the, practice, statement, of, 1966, the, house, of, lords, decided, to, allow, itself, to, adapt, english, law, to, meet, changing, social, conditions, in, r, v, g, ukhl, 50, the, house, of, lords, overruled, its, 1981, decision, in, r, v, caldwell, which, had, allowed, the, lords, to, establish, mens, rea, guilty, mind, by, measuring, a, defendant, s, conduct, against, that, of, a, reasonable, person, regardless, of, the, defendant, s, actual, state, of, mind, however, the, practice, statement, was, seldom, applied, by, the, house, of, lords, usually, only, as, a, last, resort, up, to, 2005, the, house, of, lords, rejected, its, past, decisions, no, more, than, 20, times, they, were, reluctant, to, use, it, because, they, feared, to, introduce, uncertainty, into, the, law, in, particular, the, practice, statement, stated, that, the, lords, would, be, especially, reluctant, to, overrule, themselves, in, criminal, cases, because, of, the, importance, of, certainty, of, that, law, the, first, case, involving, criminal, law, to, be, overruled, with, the, practice, statement, was, anderton, v, ryan, 1985, which, was, overruled, by, r, v, shivpuri, 1986, two, decades, after, the, practice, statement, remarkably, the, precedent, overruled, had, been, made, only, a, year, before, but, it, had, been, criticised, by, several, academic, lawyers, as, a, result, lord, bridge, stated, he, was, undeterred, by, the, consideration, that, the, decision, in, anderton, v, ryan, was, so, recent, the, practice, statement, is, an, effective, abandonment, of, our, pretension, to, infallibility, if, a, serious, error, embodied, in, a, decision, of, this, house, has, distorted, the, law, the, sooner, it, is, corrected, the, better, still, the, house, of, lords, has, remained, reluctant, to, overrule, itself, in, some, cases, in, r, v, kansal, 2002, the, majority, of, house, members, adopted, the, opinion, that, r, v, lambert, had, been, wrongly, decided, and, agreed, to, depart, from, their, earlier, decision, a, precedent, does, not, bind, a, court, if, it, finds, there, was, a, lack, of, care, in, the, original, per, incuriam, for, example, if, a, statutory, provision, or, precedent, had, not, been, brought, to, the, previous, court, s, attention, before, its, decision, the, precedent, would, not, be, binding, one, of, the, most, important, roles, of, precedent, is, to, resolve, ambiguities, in, other, legal, texts, such, as, constitutions, statutes, and, regulations, the, process, involves, first, and, foremost, consultation, of, the, plain, language, of, the, text, as, enlightened, by, the, legislative, history, of, enactment, subsequent, precedent, and, experience, with, various, interpretations, of, similar, texts, a, judge, s, normal, aids, include, access, to, all, previous, cases, in, which, a, precedent, has, been, set, and, a, good, english, dictionary, judges, and, barristers, in, the, uk, use, three, primary, rules, for, interpreting, the, law, under, the, literal, rule, the, judge, should, do, what, the, actual, legislation, states, rather, than, trying, to, do, what, the, judge, thinks, that, it, means, the, judge, should, use, the, plain, everyday, ordinary, meaning, of, the, words, even, if, this, produces, an, unjust, or, undesirable, outcome, a, good, example, of, problems, with, this, method, is, r, v, maginnis, 1987, in, which, several, judges, in, separate, opinions, found, several, different, dictionary, meanings, of, the, word, supply, another, example, is, fisher, v, bell, where, it, was, held, that, a, shopkeeper, who, placed, an, illegal, item, in, a, shop, window, with, a, price, tag, did, not, make, an, offer, to, sell, it, because, of, the, specific, meaning, of, offer, for, sale, in, contract, law, merely, an, invitation, to, treat, as, a, result, of, this, case, parliament, amended, the, statute, concerned, to, end, this, discrepancy, the, golden, rule, is, used, when, use, of, the, literal, rule, would, obviously, create, an, absurd, result, there, are, two, ways, in, which, the, golden, rule, can, be, applied, a, narrow, method, and, a, broad, method, under, the, narrow, method, when, there, are, apparently, two, contradictory, meanings, to, the, wording, of, a, legislative, provision, or, the, wording, is, ambiguous, the, least, absurd, is, to, be, preferred, under, the, broad, method, the, court, modifies, the, literal, meaning, in, such, a, way, as, to, avoid, the, absurd, result, an, example, of, the, latter, approach, is, adler, v, george, 1964, under, the, official, secrets, act, 1920, it, was, an, offence, to, obstruct, hm, forces, in, the, vicinity, of, a, prohibited, place, adler, argued, that, he, was, not, in, the, vicinity, of, such, a, place, but, was, actually, in, it, the, court, chose, not, to, read, the, statutory, wording, in, a, literal, sense, to, avoid, what, would, otherwise, be, an, absurd, result, and, adler, was, convicted, the, mischief, rule, is, the, most, flexible, of, the, interpretation, methods, stemming, from, heydon, s, case, 1584, it, allows, the, court, to, enforce, what, the, statute, is, intended, to, remedy, rather, than, what, the, words, actually, say, for, example, in, corkery, v, carpenter, 1950, a, man, was, found, guilty, of, being, drunk, in, charge, of, a, carriage, although, in, fact, he, only, had, a, bicycle, the, final, rule, although, will, no, longer, be, used, after, the, uk, fully, transitions, out, of, the, european, union, known, as, the, purposive, approach, this, considers, the, intention, of, the, european, court, of, justice, when, the, act, was, passed, in, the, united, states, the, courts, have, stated, consistently, that, the, text, of, the, statute, is, read, as, it, is, written, using, the, ordinary, meaning, of, the, words, of, the, statute, however, most, legal, texts, have, some, lingering, ambiguity, inevitably, situations, arise, in, which, the, words, chosen, by, the, legislature, do, not, address, the, precise, facts, in, issue, or, there, is, some, tension, among, two, or, more, statutes, in, such, cases, a, court, must, analyze, the, various, available, sources, and, reach, a, resolution, of, the, ambiguity, the, canons, of, statutory, construction, are, discussed, in, a, separate, article, once, the, ambiguity, is, resolved, that, resolution, has, binding, effect, as, described, in, the, rest, of, this, article, although, inferior, courts, are, bound, in, theory, by, superior, court, precedent, in, practice, a, judge, may, believe, that, justice, requires, an, outcome, at, some, variance, with, precedent, and, may, distinguish, the, facts, of, the, individual, case, on, reasoning, that, does, not, appear, in, the, binding, precedent, on, appeal, the, appellate, court, may, either, adopt, the, new, reasoning, or, reverse, on, the, basis, of, precedent, on, the, other, hand, if, the, losing, party, does, not, appeal, typically, because, of, the, cost, of, the, appeal, the, lower, court, decision, may, remain, in, effect, at, least, as, to, the, individual, parties, occasionally, lower, court, judges, may, explicitly, state, a, personal, disagreement, with, the, rendered, judgment, but, are, required, to, rule, a, particular, way, because, of, binding, precedent, inferior, courts, cannot, evade, binding, precedent, of, superior, courts, but, a, court, can, depart, from, its, own, prior, decisions, in, the, united, states, stare, decisis, can, interact, in, counterintuitive, ways, with, the, federal, and, state, court, systems, on, an, issue, of, federal, law, a, state, court, is, not, bound, by, an, interpretation, of, federal, law, at, the, district, or, circuit, level, but, is, bound, by, an, interpretation, by, the, united, states, supreme, court, on, an, interpretation, of, state, law, whether, common, law, or, statutory, law, the, federal, courts, are, bound, by, the, interpretation, of, a, state, court, of, last, resort, and, are, required, normally, to, defer, to, the, precedent, of, intermediate, state, courts, as, well, courts, may, choose, to, obey, precedent, of, international, jurisdictions, but, this, is, not, an, application, of, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, because, foreign, decisions, are, not, binding, rather, a, foreign, decision, that, is, obeyed, on, the, basis, of, the, soundness, of, its, reasoning, will, be, called, persuasive, authority, indicating, that, its, effect, is, limited, to, the, persuasiveness, of, the, reasons, it, provides, originalism, is, an, approach, to, interpretation, of, a, legal, text, in, which, controlling, weight, is, given, to, the, intent, of, the, original, authors, at, least, the, intent, as, inferred, by, a, modern, judge, in, contrast, a, non, originalist, looks, at, other, cues, to, meaning, including, the, current, meaning, of, the, words, the, pattern, and, trend, of, other, judicial, decisions, changing, context, and, improved, scientific, understanding, observation, of, practical, outcomes, and, what, works, contemporary, standards, of, justice, and, stare, decisis, both, are, directed, at, interpreting, the, text, not, changing, it, interpretation, is, the, process, of, resolving, ambiguity, and, choosing, from, among, possible, meanings, not, changing, the, text, the, two, approaches, look, at, different, sets, of, underlying, facts, that, may, or, may, not, point, in, the, same, direction, stare, decisis, gives, most, weight, to, the, newest, understanding, of, a, legal, text, while, originalism, gives, most, weight, to, the, oldest, while, they, do, not, necessarily, reach, different, results, in, every, case, the, two, approaches, are, in, direct, tension, originalists, such, as, justice, antonin, scalia, argue, that, stare, decisis, is, not, usually, a, doctrine, used, in, civil, law, systems, because, it, violates, the, principle, that, only, the, legislature, may, make, law, justice, scalia, argues, that, america, is, a, civil, law, nation, not, a, common, law, nation, by, principle, originalists, are, generally, unwilling, to, defer, to, precedent, when, precedent, seems, to, come, into, conflict, with, the, originalist, s, own, interpretation, of, the, constitutional, text, or, inferences, of, original, intent, even, in, situations, where, there, is, no, original, source, statement, of, that, original, intent, however, there, is, still, room, within, an, originalist, paradigm, for, stare, decisis, whenever, the, plain, meaning, of, the, text, has, alternative, constructions, past, precedent, is, generally, considered, a, valid, guide, with, the, qualifier, being, that, it, cannot, change, what, the, text, actually, says, originalists, vary, in, the, degree, to, which, they, defer, to, precedent, in, his, confirmation, hearings, justice, clarence, thomas, answered, a, question, from, senator, strom, thurmond, qualifying, his, willingness, to, change, precedent, in, this, way, i, think, overruling, a, case, or, reconsidering, a, case, is, a, very, serious, matter, certainly, you, would, have, to, be, of, the, view, that, a, case, is, incorrectly, decided, but, i, think, even, that, is, not, adequate, there, are, some, cases, that, you, may, not, agree, with, that, should, not, be, overruled, stare, decisis, provides, continuity, to, our, system, it, provides, predictability, and, in, our, process, of, case, by, case, decision, making, i, think, it, is, a, very, important, and, critical, concept, a, judge, that, wants, to, reconsider, a, case, and, certainly, one, who, wants, to, overrule, a, case, has, the, burden, of, demonstrating, that, not, only, is, the, case, incorrect, but, that, it, would, be, appropriate, in, view, of, stare, decisis, to, make, that, additional, step, of, overruling, that, case, possibly, he, has, changed, his, mind, or, there, are, a, very, large, body, of, cases, which, merit, the, additional, step, of, ignoring, the, doctrine, according, to, scalia, clarence, thomas, doesn, t, believe, in, stare, decisis, period, if, a, constitutional, line, of, authority, is, wrong, he, would, say, let, s, get, it, right, caleb, nelson, a, former, clerk, for, justice, thomas, and, law, professor, at, the, university, of, virginia, has, elaborated, on, the, role, of, stare, decisis, in, originalist, jurisprudence, american, courts, of, last, resort, recognize, a, rebuttable, presumption, against, overruling, their, own, past, decisions, in, earlier, eras, people, often, suggested, that, this, presumption, did, not, apply, if, the, past, decision, in, the, view, of, the, court, s, current, members, was, demonstrably, erroneous, but, when, the, supreme, court, makes, similar, noises, today, it, is, roundly, criticized, at, least, within, the, academy, conventional, wisdom, now, maintains, that, a, purported, demonstration, of, error, is, not, enough, to, justify, overruling, a, past, decision, he, conventional, wisdom, is, wrong, to, suggest, that, any, coherent, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, must, include, a, presumption, against, overruling, precedent, that, the, current, court, deems, demonstrably, erroneous, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, would, indeed, be, no, doctrine, at, all, if, courts, were, free, to, overrule, a, past, decision, simply, because, they, would, have, reached, a, different, decision, as, an, original, matter, but, when, a, court, says, that, a, past, decision, is, demonstrably, erroneous, it, is, saying, not, only, that, it, would, have, reached, a, different, decision, as, an, original, matter, but, also, that, the, prior, court, went, beyond, the, range, of, indeterminacy, created, by, the, relevant, source, of, law, americans, from, the, founding, on, believed, that, court, decisions, could, help, liquidate, or, settle, the, meaning, of, ambiguous, provisions, of, written, law, later, courts, generally, were, supposed, to, abide, by, such, liquidations, to, the, extent, that, the, underlying, legal, provision, was, determinate, however, courts, were, not, thought, to, be, similarly, bound, by, precedent, that, misinterpreted, it, of, the, court, s, current, members, justices, scalia, and, thomas, seem, to, have, the, most, faith, in, the, determinacy, of, the, legal, texts, that, come, before, the, court, it, should, come, as, no, surprise, that, they, also, seem, the, most, willing, to, overrule, the, court, s, past, decisions, prominent, journalists, and, other, commentators, suggest, that, there, is, some, contradiction, between, these, justices, mantra, of, judicial, restraint, and, any, systematic, re, examination, of, precedent, but, if, one, believes, in, the, determinacy, of, the, underlying, legal, texts, one, need, not, define, judicial, restraint, solely, in, terms, of, fidelity, to, precedent, one, can, also, speak, of, fidelity, to, the, texts, themselves, there, are, disadvantages, and, advantages, of, binding, precedent, as, noted, by, scholars, and, jurists, one, of, the, most, prominent, critics, of, the, development, of, legal, precedent, on, a, case, by, case, basis, as, both, overly, reactive, and, unfairly, retroactive, was, philosopher, jeremy, bentham, he, famously, attacked, the, common, law, as, dog, law, when, your, dog, does, anything, you, want, to, break, him, of, you, wait, till, he, does, it, and, then, beat, him, for, it, this, is, the, way, you, make, laws, for, your, dog, and, this, is, the, way, the, judges, make, law, for, you, and, me, in, a, 1997, book, attorney, michael, trotter, blamed, overreliance, by, american, lawyers, on, precedent, especially, persuasive, authority, of, marginal, relevance, rather, than, the, merits, of, the, case, at, hand, as, a, major, factor, behind, the, escalation, of, legal, costs, during, the, 20th, century, he, argued, that, courts, should, ban, the, citation, of, persuasive, authority, from, outside, their, jurisdiction, and, force, lawyers, and, parties, to, argue, only, from, binding, precedent, subject, to, two, exceptions, the, disadvantages, of, stare, decisis, include, its, rigidity, the, complexity, of, learning, law, the, fact, that, differences, between, certain, cases, may, be, very, small, and, thereby, appear, illogical, and, arbitrary, and, the, slow, growth, or, incremental, changes, to, the, law, that, are, in, need, of, major, overhaul, an, argument, often, leveled, against, precedent, is, that, it, is, undemocratic, because, it, allows, judges, who, may, or, may, not, be, elected, to, make, law, a, counter, argument, in, favor, of, the, advantages, of, stare, decisis, is, that, if, the, legislature, wishes, to, alter, the, case, law, other, than, constitutional, interpretations, by, statute, the, legislature, is, empowered, to, do, so, critics, sometimes, accuse, particular, judges, of, applying, the, doctrine, selectively, invoking, it, to, support, precedent, that, the, judge, supported, anyway, but, ignoring, it, in, order, to, change, precedent, with, which, the, judge, disagreed, there, is, much, discussion, about, the, virtue, of, using, stare, decisis, supporters, of, the, system, such, as, minimalists, argue, that, obeying, precedent, makes, decisions, predictable, for, example, a, business, person, can, be, reasonably, assured, of, predicting, a, decision, where, the, facts, of, his, or, her, case, are, sufficiently, similar, to, a, case, decided, previously, this, parallels, the, arguments, against, retroactive, ex, post, facto, laws, banned, by, the, u, s, constitution, some, instances, of, disregarding, precedent, are, almost, universally, considered, inappropriate, for, example, in, a, rare, showing, of, unity, in, a, supreme, court, opinion, discussing, judicial, activism, justice, stevens, wrote, that, a, circuit, court, engaged, in, an, indefensible, brand, of, judicial, activism, when, it, refused, to, follow, a, controlling, precedent, of, the, supreme, court, the, rule, that, lower, courts, should, abide, by, controlling, precedent, sometimes, called, vertical, precedent, can, safely, be, called, settled, law, it, appears, to, be, equally, well, accepted, that, the, act, of, disregarding, vertical, precedent, qualifies, as, one, kind, of, judicial, activism, horizontal, precedent, the, doctrine, requiring, a, court, to, follow, its, own, prior, decisions, in, similar, cases, is, a, more, complicated, and, debatable, matter, cademics, argue, that, it, is, sometimes, proper, to, disregard, horizontal, precedent, professor, gary, lawson, for, example, has, argued, that, stare, decisis, itself, may, be, unconstitutional, if, it, requires, the, court, to, adhere, to, an, erroneous, reading, of, the, constitution, if, the, constitution, says, x, and, a, prior, judicial, decision, says, y, a, court, has, not, merely, the, power, but, the, obligation, to, prefer, the, constitution, in, the, same, vein, professors, ahkil, amar, and, vikram, amar, have, stated, our, general, view, is, that, the, rehnquist, court, s, articulated, theory, of, stare, decisis, tends, to, improperly, elevate, judicial, doctrine, over, the, constitution, itself, it, does, so, they, argue, by, requiring, excessive, deference, to, past, decisions, that, themselves, may, have, been, misinterpretations, of, the, law, of, the, land, for, lawson, akhil, amar, and, vikram, amar, dismissing, erroneous, horizontal, precedent, would, not, be, judicial, activism, instead, it, would, be, appropriate, constitutional, decisionmaking
