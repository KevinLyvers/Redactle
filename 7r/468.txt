vietnamese, ti, ng, vi, t, is, a, vietic, language, in, the, austroasiatic, language, family, spoken, primarily, in, vietnam, where, it, is, the, national, and, official, language, vietnamese, is, spoken, natively, by, around, 85, million, people, several, times, as, many, as, the, rest, of, the, austroasiatic, family, combined, it, is, the, native, language, of, the, vietnamese, kinh, people, as, well, as, a, second, or, first, language, for, other, ethnic, groups, in, vietnam, and, still, used, by, vietnamese, diaspora, in, the, world, like, many, languages, in, southeast, asia, and, east, asia, vietnamese, is, highly, analytic, and, is, tonal, it, has, head, initial, directionality, with, subject, verb, object, order, and, modifiers, following, the, words, they, modify, it, also, uses, noun, classifiers, its, vocabulary, has, had, significant, influence, from, middle, chinese, and, loanwords, from, french, although, it, is, often, mistakenly, thought, as, being, an, monosyllabic, language, vietnamese, words, typically, consist, of, from, one, to, many, as, ten, morphemes, or, syllables, the, majority, of, vietnamese, vocabulary, are, disyllabic, and, trisyllabic, words, vietnamese, is, written, using, the, vietnamese, alphabet, ch, qu, c, ng, the, alphabet, is, based, on, the, latin, script, and, was, officially, adopted, in, the, early, 20th, century, during, french, rule, of, vietnam, it, uses, digraphs, and, diacritics, to, mark, tones, and, some, phonemes, vietnamese, was, historically, written, using, ch, n, m, a, logographic, script, using, chinese, characters, ch, h, n, to, represent, sino, vietnamese, vocabulary, and, some, native, vietnamese, words, together, with, many, locally, invented, characters, to, represent, other, words, early, linguistic, work, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, logan, 1852, forbes, 1881, m, ller, 1888, kuhn, 1889, schmidt, 1905, przyluski, 1924, and, benedict, 1942, classified, vietnamese, as, belonging, to, the, mon, khmer, branch, of, the, austroasiatic, language, family, which, also, includes, the, khmer, language, spoken, in, cambodia, as, well, as, various, smaller, and, or, regional, languages, such, as, the, munda, and, khasi, languages, spoken, in, eastern, india, and, others, in, laos, southern, china, and, parts, of, thailand, in, 1850, british, lawyer, james, richardson, logan, detected, striking, similarities, between, the, korku, language, in, central, india, and, vietnamese, he, suggested, that, korku, mon, and, vietnamese, were, part, of, what, he, termed, mon, annam, languages, in, a, paper, published, in, 1856, later, in, 1920, french, polish, linguist, jean, przyluski, found, that, m, ng, is, more, closely, related, to, vietnamese, than, other, mon, khmer, languages, and, a, viet, muong, subgrouping, was, established, also, including, thavung, chut, cuoi, etc, the, term, vietic, was, proposed, by, hayes, 1992, who, proposed, to, redefine, viet, muong, as, referring, to, a, subbranch, of, vietic, containing, only, vietnamese, and, m, ng, the, term, vietic, is, used, among, others, by, g, rard, diffloth, with, a, slightly, different, proposal, on, subclassification, within, which, the, term, viet, muong, refers, to, a, lower, subgrouping, within, an, eastern, vietic, branch, consisting, of, vietnamese, dialects, m, ng, dialects, and, ngu, n, of, qu, ng, b, nh, province, austroasiatic, is, believed, to, have, dispersed, around, 2000, bc, the, arrival, of, the, agricultural, ph, ng, nguy, n, culture, in, the, red, river, delta, at, that, time, may, correspond, to, the, vietic, branch, this, ancestral, vietic, was, typologically, very, different, from, later, vietnamese, it, was, polysyllabic, or, rather, sesquisyllabic, with, roots, consisting, of, a, reduced, syllable, followed, by, a, full, syllable, and, featured, many, consonant, clusters, both, of, these, features, are, found, elsewhere, in, austroasiatic, and, in, modern, conservative, vietic, languages, south, of, the, red, river, area, the, language, was, non, tonal, but, featured, glottal, stop, and, voiceless, fricative, codas, borrowed, vocabulary, indicates, early, contact, with, speakers, of, tai, languages, in, the, last, millennium, bc, which, is, consistent, with, genetic, evidence, from, dong, son, culture, sites, extensive, contact, with, chinese, began, from, the, han, dynasty, 2nd, century, bc, at, this, time, vietic, groups, began, to, expand, south, from, the, red, river, delta, and, into, the, adjacent, uplands, possibly, to, escape, chinese, encroachment, the, oldest, layer, of, loans, from, chinese, into, northern, vietic, which, would, become, the, viet, muong, subbranch, date, from, this, period, the, northern, vietic, varieties, thus, became, part, of, the, mainland, southeast, asia, linguistic, area, in, which, languages, from, genetically, unrelated, families, converged, toward, characteristics, such, as, isolating, morphology, and, similar, syllable, structure, many, languages, in, this, area, including, viet, muong, underwent, a, process, of, tonogenesis, in, which, distinctions, formerly, expressed, by, final, consonants, became, phonemic, tonal, distinctions, when, those, consonants, disappeared, these, characteristics, have, become, part, of, many, of, the, genetically, unrelated, languages, of, southeast, asia, for, example, tsat, a, member, of, the, malayo, polynesian, group, within, austronesian, and, vietnamese, each, developed, tones, as, a, phonemic, feature, after, the, split, from, muong, around, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, ad, the, following, stages, of, vietnamese, are, commonly, identified, after, expelling, the, chinese, at, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, the, ng, dynasty, adopted, classical, chinese, as, the, formal, medium, of, government, scholarship, and, literature, with, the, dominance, of, chinese, came, wholesale, importation, of, chinese, vocabulary, the, resulting, sino, vietnamese, vocabulary, makes, up, about, a, third, of, the, vietnamese, lexicon, in, all, realms, and, may, account, for, as, much, as, 60, of, the, vocabulary, used, in, formal, texts, vietic, languages, were, confined, to, the, northern, third, of, modern, vietnam, until, the, southward, advance, nam, ti, n, from, the, late, 15th, century, the, conquest, of, the, ancient, nation, of, champa, and, the, conquest, of, the, mekong, delta, led, to, an, expansion, of, the, vietnamese, people, and, language, with, distinctive, local, variations, emerging, after, france, invaded, vietnam, in, the, late, 19th, century, french, gradually, replaced, literary, chinese, as, the, official, language, in, education, and, government, vietnamese, adopted, many, french, terms, such, as, m, dame, from, madame, ga, train, station, from, gare, s, mi, shirt, from, chemise, and, b, p, b, doll, from, poup, e, resulting, in, a, language, that, was, austroasiatic, but, with, major, sino, influences, and, some, minor, french, influences, from, the, french, colonial, era, the, following, diagram, shows, the, phonology, of, proto, viet, muong, the, nearest, ancestor, of, vietnamese, and, the, closely, related, m, ng, language, along, with, the, outcomes, in, the, modern, language, 1, according, to, ferlus, t, and, are, not, accepted, by, all, researchers, ferlus, 1992, also, had, additional, phonemes, d, and, 2, the, fricatives, indicated, above, in, parentheses, developed, as, allophones, of, stop, consonants, occurring, between, vowels, i, e, when, a, minor, syllable, occurred, these, fricatives, were, not, present, in, proto, viet, muong, as, indicated, by, their, absence, in, m, ng, but, were, evidently, present, in, the, later, proto, vietnamese, stage, subsequent, loss, of, the, minor, syllable, prefixes, phonemicized, the, fricatives, ferlus, 1992, proposes, that, originally, there, were, both, voiced, and, voiceless, fricatives, corresponding, to, original, voiced, or, voiceless, stops, but, ferlus, 2009, appears, to, have, abandoned, that, hypothesis, suggesting, that, stops, were, softened, and, voiced, at, approximately, the, same, time, according, to, the, following, pattern, 3, in, middle, vietnamese, the, outcome, of, these, sounds, was, written, with, a, hooked, b, representing, a, that, was, still, distinct, from, v, then, pronounced, w, see, below, 4, it, is, unclear, what, this, sound, was, according, to, ferlus, 1992, in, the, archaic, vietnamese, period, c, 10th, century, ad, when, sino, vietnamese, vocabulary, was, borrowed, it, was, r, distinct, at, that, time, from, r, the, following, initial, clusters, occurred, with, outcomes, indicated, a, large, number, of, words, were, borrowed, from, middle, chinese, forming, part, of, the, sino, vietnamese, vocabulary, these, caused, the, original, introduction, of, the, retroflex, sounds, and, modern, s, tr, into, the, language, proto, viet, muong, did, not, have, tones, tones, developed, later, in, some, of, the, daughter, languages, from, distinctions, in, the, initial, and, final, consonants, vietnamese, tones, developed, as, follows, glottal, ending, syllables, ended, with, a, glottal, stop, while, fricative, ending, syllables, ended, with, s, or, h, both, types, of, syllables, could, co, occur, with, a, resonant, e, g, m, or, n, at, some, point, a, tone, split, occurred, as, in, many, other, mainland, southeast, asian, languages, essentially, an, allophonic, distinction, developed, in, the, tones, whereby, the, tones, in, syllables, with, voiced, initials, were, pronounced, differently, from, those, with, voiceless, initials, approximately, speaking, the, voiced, allotones, were, pronounced, with, additional, breathy, voice, or, creaky, voice, and, with, lowered, pitch, the, quality, difference, predominates, in, today, s, northern, varieties, e, g, in, hanoi, while, in, the, southern, varieties, the, pitch, difference, predominates, as, in, ho, chi, minh, city, subsequent, to, this, the, plain, voiced, stops, became, voiceless, and, the, allotones, became, new, phonemic, tones, the, implosive, stops, were, unaffected, and, in, fact, developed, tonally, as, if, they, were, unvoiced, this, behavior, is, common, to, all, east, asian, languages, with, implosive, stops, as, noted, above, proto, viet, muong, had, sesquisyllabic, words, with, an, initial, minor, syllable, in, addition, to, and, independent, of, initial, clusters, in, the, main, syllable, when, a, minor, syllable, occurred, the, main, syllable, s, initial, consonant, was, intervocalic, and, as, a, result, suffered, lenition, becoming, a, voiced, fricative, the, minor, syllables, were, eventually, lost, but, not, until, the, tone, split, had, occurred, as, a, result, words, in, modern, vietnamese, with, voiced, fricatives, occur, in, all, six, tones, and, the, tonal, register, reflects, the, voicing, of, the, minor, syllable, prefix, and, not, the, voicing, of, the, main, syllable, stop, in, proto, viet, muong, that, produced, the, fricative, for, similar, reasons, words, beginning, with, l, and, occur, in, both, registers, thompson, 1976, reconstructed, voiceless, resonants, to, account, for, outcomes, where, resonants, occur, with, a, first, register, tone, but, this, is, no, longer, considered, necessary, at, least, by, ferlus, old, vietnamese, ancient, vietnamese, was, a, vietic, language, which, was, separated, from, viet, muong, around, the, 9th, century, and, evolved, into, middle, vietnamese, by, 16th, century, the, sources, for, the, reconstruction, of, old, vietnamese, are, nom, texts, such, as, the, 12th, century, 1486, buddhist, scripture, ph, t, thuy, t, i, b, o, ph, m, u, n, tr, ng, kinh, s, tra, explained, by, the, buddha, on, the, great, repayment, of, the, heavy, debt, to, parents, old, inscriptions, and, a, late, 13th, century, possibly, 1293, annan, jishi, glossary, by, chinese, diplomat, chen, fu, c, 1259, 1309, old, vietnamese, used, chinese, characters, phonetically, where, each, word, monosyllabic, in, modern, vietnamese, is, written, with, two, chinese, characters, or, in, a, composite, character, made, of, two, different, characters, this, conveys, the, transformation, of, the, vietnamese, lexicon, from, sesquisyllabic, to, fully, monosyllabic, under, the, pressure, of, chinese, linguistic, influence, characterized, by, linguistic, phenomena, such, as, the, reduction, of, minor, syllables, loss, of, affixal, morphology, drifting, towards, analytical, grammar, simplification, of, major, syllable, segments, and, the, change, of, suprasegment, instruments, for, example, the, modern, vietnamese, word, tr, i, heaven, was, read, as, pl, i, in, old, ancient, vietnamese, and, as, bl, i, in, middle, vietnamese, the, writing, system, used, for, vietnamese, is, based, closely, on, the, system, developed, by, alexandre, de, rhodes, for, his, 1651, dictionarium, annamiticum, lusitanum, et, latinum, it, reflects, the, pronunciation, of, the, vietnamese, of, hanoi, at, that, time, a, stage, commonly, termed, middle, vietnamese, ti, ng, vi, t, trung, i, the, pronunciation, of, the, rime, of, the, syllable, i, e, all, parts, other, than, the, initial, consonant, optional, w, glide, vowel, nucleus, tone, and, final, consonant, appears, nearly, identical, between, middle, vietnamese, and, modern, hanoi, pronunciation, on, the, other, hand, the, middle, vietnamese, pronunciation, of, the, initial, consonant, differs, greatly, from, all, modern, dialects, and, in, fact, is, significantly, closer, to, the, modern, saigon, dialect, than, the, modern, hanoi, dialect, the, following, diagram, shows, the, orthography, and, pronunciation, of, middle, vietnamese, 1, occurs, only, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, 2, this, letter, is, no, longer, used, 3, does, not, occur, at, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, but, can, occur, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, where, it, is, notated, i, or, y, with, the, difference, between, the, two, often, indicating, differences, in, the, quality, or, length, of, the, preceding, vowel, and, after, and, where, it, is, notated, this, and, the, j, it, notated, have, disappeared, from, the, modern, language, note, that, b, and, p, never, contrast, in, any, position, suggesting, that, they, are, allophones, the, language, also, has, three, clusters, at, the, beginning, of, syllables, which, have, since, disappeared, most, of, the, unusual, correspondences, between, spelling, and, modern, pronunciation, are, explained, by, middle, vietnamese, note, in, particular, de, rhodes, s, orthography, also, made, use, of, an, apex, diacritic, as, in, o, and, u, to, indicate, a, final, labial, velar, nasal, m, an, allophone, of, that, is, peculiar, to, the, hanoi, dialect, to, the, present, day, this, diacritic, is, often, mistaken, for, a, tilde, in, modern, reproductions, of, early, vietnamese, writing, as, a, result, of, emigration, vietnamese, speakers, are, also, found, in, other, parts, of, southeast, asia, east, asia, north, america, europe, and, australia, vietnamese, has, also, been, officially, recognized, as, a, minority, language, in, the, czech, republic, as, the, national, language, vietnamese, is, the, lingua, franca, in, vietnam, it, is, also, spoken, by, the, jing, people, traditionally, residing, on, three, islands, now, joined, to, the, mainland, off, dongxing, in, southern, guangxi, province, china, a, large, number, of, vietnamese, speakers, also, reside, in, neighboring, countries, of, cambodia, and, laos, in, the, united, states, vietnamese, is, the, sixth, most, spoken, language, with, over, 1, 5, million, speakers, who, are, concentrated, in, a, handful, of, states, it, is, the, third, most, spoken, language, in, texas, and, washington, fourth, most, in, georgia, louisiana, and, virginia, and, fifth, most, in, arkansas, and, california, vietnamese, is, the, third, most, spoken, language, in, australia, other, than, english, after, mandarin, and, arabic, in, france, it, is, the, most, spoken, asian, language, and, the, eighth, most, spoken, immigrant, language, at, home, vietnamese, is, the, sole, official, and, national, language, of, vietnam, it, is, the, first, language, of, the, majority, of, the, vietnamese, population, as, well, as, a, first, or, second, language, for, the, country, s, ethnic, minority, groups, in, the, czech, republic, vietnamese, has, been, recognized, as, one, of, 14, minority, languages, on, the, basis, of, communities, that, have, resided, in, the, country, either, traditionally, or, on, a, long, term, basis, this, status, grants, the, vietnamese, community, in, the, country, a, representative, on, the, government, council, for, nationalities, an, advisory, body, of, the, czech, government, for, matters, of, policy, towards, national, minorities, and, their, members, it, also, grants, the, community, the, right, to, use, vietnamese, with, public, authorities, and, in, courts, anywhere, in, the, country, vietnamese, is, taught, in, schools, and, institutions, outside, of, vietnam, a, large, part, contributed, by, its, diaspora, in, countries, with, vietnamese, speaking, communities, vietnamese, language, education, largely, serves, as, a, role, to, link, descendants, of, vietnamese, immigrants, to, their, ancestral, culture, in, neighboring, countries, and, vicinities, near, vietnam, such, as, southern, china, cambodia, laos, and, thailand, vietnamese, as, a, foreign, language, is, largely, due, to, trade, as, well, as, recovery, and, growth, of, the, vietnamese, economy, since, the, 1980s, vietnamese, language, schools, tr, ng, vi, t, ng, tr, ng, ng, n, ng, ti, ng, vi, t, have, been, established, for, youth, in, many, vietnamese, speaking, communities, around, the, world, such, as, in, the, united, states, germany, and, france, vietnamese, has, a, large, number, of, vowels, below, is, a, vowel, diagram, of, vietnamese, from, hanoi, including, centering, diphthongs, front, and, central, vowels, i, e, a, are, unrounded, whereas, the, back, vowels, u, o, are, rounded, the, vowels, and, are, pronounced, very, short, much, shorter, than, the, other, vowels, thus, and, are, basically, pronounced, the, same, except, that, is, of, normal, length, while, is, short, the, same, applies, to, the, vowels, long, a, and, short, the, centering, diphthongs, are, formed, with, only, the, three, high, vowels, i, u, they, are, generally, spelled, as, ia, a, ua, when, they, end, a, word, and, are, spelled, i, u, respectively, when, they, are, followed, by, a, consonant, in, addition, to, single, vowels, or, monophthongs, and, centering, diphthongs, vietnamese, has, closing, diphthongs, and, triphthongs, the, closing, diphthongs, and, triphthongs, consist, of, a, main, vowel, component, followed, by, a, shorter, semivowel, offglide, j, or, w, there, are, restrictions, on, the, high, offglides, j, cannot, occur, after, a, front, vowel, i, e, nucleus, and, w, cannot, occur, after, a, back, vowel, u, o, nucleus, the, correspondence, between, the, orthography, and, pronunciation, is, complicated, for, example, the, offglide, j, is, usually, written, as, i, however, it, may, also, be, represented, with, y, in, addition, in, the, diphthongs, and, the, letters, y, and, i, also, indicate, the, pronunciation, of, the, main, vowel, ay, j, ai, a, j, thus, tay, hand, is, while, tai, ear, is, similarly, u, and, o, indicate, different, pronunciations, of, the, main, vowel, au, w, ao, a, w, thus, thau, brass, is, while, thao, raw, silk, is, the, consonants, that, occur, in, vietnamese, are, listed, below, in, the, vietnamese, orthography, with, the, phonetic, pronunciation, to, the, right, some, consonant, sounds, are, written, with, only, one, letter, like, p, other, consonant, sounds, are, written, with, a, digraph, like, ph, and, others, are, written, with, more, than, one, letter, or, digraph, the, velar, stop, is, written, variously, as, c, k, or, q, in, some, cases, they, are, based, on, their, middle, vietnamese, pronunciation, since, that, period, ph, and, kh, but, not, th, have, evolved, from, aspirated, stops, into, fricatives, like, greek, phi, and, chi, while, d, and, gi, have, collapsed, and, converged, together, into, z, in, the, north, and, j, in, the, south, not, all, dialects, of, vietnamese, have, the, same, consonant, in, a, given, word, although, all, dialects, use, the, same, spelling, in, the, written, language, see, the, language, variation, section, for, further, elaboration, syllable, final, orthographic, ch, and, nh, in, vietnamese, has, had, different, analyses, one, analysis, has, final, ch, nh, as, being, phonemes, c, contrasting, with, syllable, final, t, c, t, k, and, n, ng, n, and, identifies, final, ch, with, the, syllable, initial, ch, c, the, other, analysis, has, final, ch, and, nh, as, predictable, allophonic, variants, of, the, velar, phonemes, k, and, that, occur, after, the, upper, front, vowels, i, i, and, e, although, they, also, occur, after, a, but, in, such, cases, are, believed, to, have, resulted, from, an, earlier, e, which, diphthongized, to, ai, cf, ach, from, aic, anh, from, aing, see, vietnamese, phonology, analysis, of, final, ch, nh, for, further, details, each, vietnamese, syllable, is, pronounced, with, one, of, six, inherent, tones, centered, on, the, main, vowel, or, group, of, vowels, tones, differ, in, tone, is, indicated, by, diacritics, written, above, or, below, the, vowel, most, of, the, tone, diacritics, appear, above, the, vowel, except, the, n, ng, tone, dot, diacritic, goes, below, the, vowel, the, six, tones, in, the, northern, varieties, including, hanoi, with, their, self, referential, vietnamese, names, are, other, dialects, of, vietnamese, may, have, fewer, tones, typically, only, five, in, vietnamese, poetry, tones, are, classed, into, two, groups, tone, pattern, words, with, tones, belonging, to, a, particular, tone, group, must, occur, in, certain, positions, within, the, poetic, verse, vietnamese, catholics, practice, a, distinctive, style, of, prayer, recitation, called, c, kinh, in, which, each, tone, is, assigned, a, specific, note, or, sequence, of, notes, before, vietnamese, switched, from, a, chinese, based, script, to, a, latin, based, script, vietnamese, had, used, the, traditional, chinese, system, of, classifying, tones, using, this, system, vietnamese, has, 8, tones, but, modern, linguists, only, count, 6, phonemic, tones, vietnamese, tones, were, classified, into, two, main, groups, b, ng, level, tones, and, tr, c, sharp, tones, tones, such, as, ngang, belong, to, the, b, ng, group, while, other, tones, such, as, ng, belong, to, the, tr, c, group, then, these, tones, were, further, divided, in, several, other, categorizes, b, nh, even, th, ng, rising, kh, departing, and, nh, p, entering, s, c, and, n, ng, are, counted, twice, in, the, system, once, in, kh, departing, and, again, in, nh, p, entering, the, reason, for, the, extra, two, tones, is, that, syllables, ending, in, the, stops, p, t, c, and, k, are, treated, as, having, entering, tones, but, phonetically, they, are, exactly, the, same, the, tones, in, the, old, classification, were, called, m, b, nh, ngang, d, ng, b, nh, huy, n, m, th, ng, h, i, d, ng, th, ng, ng, m, kh, s, c, for, words, that, do, not, end, in, p, t, c, and, k, d, ng, kh, n, ng, for, words, that, do, not, end, in, p, t, c, and, k, m, nh, p, s, c, for, words, that, do, end, in, p, t, c, and, k, and, d, ng, nh, p, n, ng, for, words, that, do, end, in, p, t, c, and, k, vietnamese, like, thai, and, many, languages, in, southeast, asia, is, an, analytic, language, vietnamese, does, not, use, morphological, marking, of, case, gender, number, or, tense, and, as, a, result, has, no, finite, nonfinite, distinction, also, like, other, languages, in, the, region, vietnamese, syntax, conforms, to, subject, verb, object, word, order, is, head, initial, displaying,

early, studies, hypothesized, vietnamese, language, origins, to, have, been, either, kra, dai, sino, tibetan, or, austroasiatic, austroasiatic, origins, are, so, far, the, most, tenable, to, date, with, some, of, the, oldest, words, in, vietnamese, being, austroasiatic, in, origin, although, vietnamese, roots, are, classified, as, austroasiatic, vietic, and, viet, muong, language, contact, with, chinese, heavily, influenced, the, vietnamese, language, causing, it, to, diverge, from, viet, muong, around, the, 10th, to, 11th, century, and, become, the, vietnamese, we, know, today, for, instance, the, vietnamese, word, qu, n, l, meaning, management, noun, or, manage, verb, likely, descended, from, the, same, word, as, gu, nl, in, chinese, also, kanri, in, japanese, and, gwalli, gwan, ri, korean, hanja, in, korean, instances, of, chinese, contact, include, the, historical, nam, vi, t, aka, nanyue, as, well, as, other, periods, of, influence, besides, english, and, french, which, have, made, some, contributions, to, the, vietnamese, language, japanese, loanwords, into, vietnamese, are, also, a, more, recently, studied, phenomenon, modern, linguists, describe, modern, vietnamese, having, lost, many, proto, austroasiatic, phonological, and, morphological, features, that, original, vietnamese, had, the, chinese, influence, on, vietnamese, corresponds, to, various, periods, when, vietnam, was, under, chinese, rule, and, subsequent, influence, after, vietnam, became, independent, early, linguists, thought, that, this, meant, the, vietnamese, lexicon, had, only, two, influxes, of, chinese, words, one, stemming, from, the, period, under, actual, chinese, rule, and, a, second, from, afterwards, these, words, are, grouped, together, as, sino, vietnamese, vocabulary, however, according, to, linguist, john, phan, annamese, middle, chinese, was, already, used, and, spoken, in, the, red, river, valley, by, the, 1st, century, ce, and, its, vocabulary, significantly, fused, with, the, co, existing, proto, viet, muong, language, the, immediate, ancestor, of, vietnamese, he, lists, three, major, classes, of, sino, vietnamese, borrowings, early, sino, vietnamese, han, dynasty, ca, 1st, century, ce, and, jin, dynasty, ca, 4th, century, ce, late, sino, vietnamese, tang, dynasty, and, recent, sino, vietnamese, ming, dynasty, and, afterwards, vietnam, became, a, french, protectorate, colonial, territory, in, 1883, until, the, geneva, accords, of, 1954, which, resulted, in, significant, influence, from, french, into, the, indochina, region, laos, cambodia, and, vietnam, examples, include, c, ph, in, vietnamese, was, derived, from, the, french, caf, coffee, yogurt, in, vietnamese, is, s, a, chua, lit, sour, milk, but, it, is, also, calqued, from, french, yaourt, into, vietnamese, da, ua, j, a, ua, ph, mai, cheese, is, from, the, french, fromage, musical, note, was, borrowed, into, vietnamese, as, n, t, or, n, t, nh, c, from, the, french, note, de, musique, the, vietnamese, term, for, steering, wheel, is, v, l, ng, a, partial, derivation, from, the, french, volant, directionnel, a, necktie, cravate, in, french, is, rendered, into, vietnamese, as, c, v, t, in, addition, modern, vietnamese, pronunciations, of, french, names, correspond, directly, to, the, original, french, pronunciations, pa, ri, for, paris, m, c, x, y, for, marseille, bo, c, for, bordeaux, etc, whereas, pronunciations, of, other, foreign, names, chinese, excluded, are, generally, derived, from, english, some, english, words, were, incorporated, into, vietnamese, as, loan, words, such, as, tv, borrowed, as, tivi, or, just, tv, but, still, officially, called, truy, n, h, nh, some, other, borrowings, are, calques, translated, into, vietnamese, for, example, software, is, translated, into, ph, n, m, m, literally, meaning, soft, part, some, scientific, terms, such, as, biological, cell, were, derived, from, ch, h, n, for, example, the, word, t, b, o, is, in, ch, h, n, whilst, other, scientific, names, such, as, acetylcholine, are, unaltered, words, like, peptide, may, be, seen, as, peptit, japanese, loanwords, are, a, more, recently, studied, phenomenon, with, a, paper, by, nguy, n, l, 2020, classifying, three, waves, of, japanese, influence, with, the, first, two, waves, being, the, principal, influxes, and, the, third, wave, coming, from, the, vietnamese, who, studied, japanese, the, first, wave, consisted, of, kanji, words, created, by, japanese, to, represent, western, concepts, that, were, not, readily, available, in, chinese, or, japanese, where, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, they, were, imported, to, other, asian, languages, this, first, influx, is, called, sino, vietnamese, words, of, japanese, origins, for, example, the, vietnamese, term, for, association, club, c, u, l, c, b, which, was, borrowed, from, chinese, pinyin, j, l, b, jyutping, keoi1, lok6, bou6, and, then, in, turn, from, japanese, kanji, katakana, r, maji, kurabu, which, came, from, the, english, club, resulting, in, indirect, borrowing, from, japanese, the, second, wave, was, during, the, brief, japanese, occupation, of, vietnam, from, 1940, until, 1945, however, japanese, cultural, influence, in, vietnam, started, significantly, from, the, 1980s, this, newer, second, wave, of, japanese, origin, loanwords, is, distinctive, from, the, sino, vietnamese, words, of, japanese, origin, in, that, they, were, borrowed, directly, from, japanese, this, vocabulary, includes, words, representative, of, japanese, culture, such, as, kimono, sumo, samurai, and, bonsai, from, modified, hepburn, romanisation, these, loanwords, are, coined, as, new, japanese, loanwords, a, significant, number, of, new, japanese, loanwords, were, also, of, chinese, origin, sometimes, the, same, concept, can, be, described, using, both, sino, vietnamese, words, of, japanese, origin, first, wave, and, new, japanese, loanwords, second, wave, for, example, judo, can, be, referred, to, as, both, judo, and, nhu, o, the, vietnamese, reading, of, some, words, such, as, l, p, x, ng, from, chinese, sausage, primarily, keep, to, the, cantonese, pronunciations, having, been, brought, over, by, southern, chinese, migrants, whereas, in, h, n, vi, t, which, has, been, described, as, being, close, to, middle, chinese, pronunciation, it, is, actually, pronounced, l, p, tr, ng, however, the, cantonese, term, is, the, better, known, name, for, chinese, sausage, in, vietnam, meanwhile, any, new, terms, calqued, from, chinese, would, be, based, on, the, mandarin, pronunciation, additionally, in, the, southern, provinces, of, vietnam, the, term, x, ng, u, can, be, used, to, refer, to, dice, which, may, have, derived, from, a, cantonese, or, teochew, idiom, x, p, x, x, p, ng, u, sino, vietnamese, th, p, t, th, p, ng, literally, fourteen, fifteen, to, mean, uncertain, basic, vocabulary, in, vietnamese, has, proto, vietic, origins, vietnamese, shares, a, large, amount, of, vocabulary, with, the, m, ng, languages, a, close, relative, of, the, vietnamese, language, other, compound, words, such, as, n, c, non, ch, n, m, country, nation, lit, water, and, mountains, appear, to, be, of, purely, vietnamese, origin, and, used, to, be, inscribed, in, ch, n, m, characters, compounded, self, coined, chinese, characters, but, are, now, written, in, the, vietnamese, alphabet, vietnamese, slang, ti, ng, l, ng, has, changed, over, time, vietnamese, slang, consists, of, pure, vietnamese, words, as, well, as, words, borrowed, from, other, languages, such, as, mandarin, or, indo, european, languages, it, is, estimated, that, vietnamese, slang, originating, from, mandarin, accounts, for, a, tiny, proportion, 4, 6, of, surveyed, data, in, newspapers, on, the, other, hand, slang, originating, from, indo, european, languages, accounts, for, a, more, significant, proportion, 12, and, is, much, more, common, in, today, s, usage, slang, borrowed, from, these, languages, can, be, either, transliteral, or, vernacular, some, examples, with, the, rise, of, the, internet, new, slang, is, generated, and, popularized, through, social, media, this, more, modern, slang, is, commonly, used, in, the, younger, generation, s, teenspeak, in, vietnam, this, recent, slang, is, mostly, pure, vietnamese, and, almost, all, the, words, are, homonyms, or, some, form, of, wordplay, some, slang, words, may, include, profanity, swear, words, derogatory, or, just, a, play, on, words, some, examples, with, newer, and, older, slang, that, originate, from, northern, central, or, southern, vietnamese, dialects, include, lu, su, bu, whilst, older, slang, has, been, used, by, previous, generations, the, prevalence, of, modern, slang, used, by, young, people, in, vietnam, as, teenspeak, has, made, conversations, more, difficult, for, older, generations, to, understand, this, has, become, subject, for, debate, some, believe, that, incorporating, teenspeak, or, internet, slang, in, daily, conversation, among, teenagers, will, affect, the, formality, and, cadence, of, their, general, speech, others, argue, that, it, is, not, slang, that, is, the, problem, but, rather, the, lack, of, communication, techniques, for, the, instant, internet, messaging, era, they, believe, slang, should, not, be, dismissed, but, instead, youth, should, be, adequately, informed, to, recognise, when, to, use, it, and, when, it, is, inappropriate, after, ending, a, millennium, of, chinese, rule, in, 939, the, vietnamese, state, adopted, literary, chinese, called, v, n, ng, n, or, h, n, v, n, in, vietnamese, for, official, purposes, up, to, the, late, 19th, century, except, for, two, brief, interludes, all, formal, writing, including, government, business, scholarship, and, formal, literature, was, done, in, literary, chinese, written, with, chinese, characters, ch, h, n, although, the, writing, system, is, now, mostly, in, ch, qu, c, ng, latin, script, chinese, script, known, as, ch, h, n, in, vietnamese, as, well, as, ch, n, m, together, h, n, n, m, is, still, present, in, such, activities, such, as, vietnamese, calligraphy, from, around, the, 13th, century, vietnamese, scholars, used, their, knowledge, of, the, chinese, script, to, develop, the, ch, n, m, lit, southern, characters, script, to, record, folk, literature, in, vietnamese, the, script, used, chinese, characters, to, represent, both, borrowed, sino, vietnamese, vocabulary, and, native, words, with, similar, pronunciation, or, meaning, in, addition, thousands, of, new, compound, characters, were, created, to, write, vietnamese, words, using, a, variety, of, methods, including, phono, semantic, compounds, for, example, in, the, opening, lines, of, the, classic, poem, the, tale, of, ki, u, the, oldest, example, of, an, early, form, of, the, n, m, is, found, in, a, list, of, names, in, the, th, p, mi, u, temple, inscription, dating, from, early, 13th, century, ad, n, m, writing, reached, its, zenith, in, the, 18th, century, when, many, vietnamese, writers, and, poets, composed, their, works, in, n, m, most, notably, nguy, n, du, and, h, xu, n, h, ng, dubbed, the, queen, of, n, m, poetry, however, it, was, only, used, for, official, purposes, during, the, brief, h, and, t, y, s, n, dynasties, 1400, 1406, and, 1778, 1802, respectively, a, vietnamese, catholic, nguy, n, tr, ng, t, unsuccessfully, petitioned, the, court, suggesting, the, adoption, of, a, script, for, vietnamese, based, on, chinese, characters, a, romanisation, of, vietnamese, was, codified, in, the, 17th, century, by, the, avignonese, jesuit, missionary, alexandre, de, rhodes, 1591, 1660, based, on, works, of, earlier, portuguese, missionaries, particularly, francisco, de, pina, gaspar, do, amaral, and, antonio, barbosa, it, reflects, a, middle, vietnamese, dialect, close, to, the, hanoi, variety, as, spoken, in, the, 17th, century, its, vowels, and, final, consonants, correspond, most, closely, to, northern, dialects, while, its, initial, consonants, are, most, similar, to, southern, dialects, this, is, not, unlike, how, english, orthography, is, based, on, the, chancery, standard, of, late, middle, english, with, many, spellings, retained, even, after, the, great, vowel, shift, the, vietnamese, alphabet, contains, 29, letters, supplementing, the, latin, alphabet, with, an, additional, consonant, letter, and, 6, additional, vowel, letters, formed, with, diacritics, the, latin, letters, f, j, w, and, z, are, not, used, the, script, also, represents, additional, phonemes, using, ten, digraphs, ch, gh, gi, kh, ng, nh, ph, qu, th, and, tr, and, a, single, trigraph, ngh, further, diacritics, are, used, to, indicate, the, tone, of, each, syllable, thus, it, is, possible, for, diacritics, to, be, stacked, e, g, combining, letter, with, diacritic, with, diacritic, for, tone, to, make, despite, the, missionaries, creation, of, the, alphabetic, script, ch, n, m, remained, the, dominant, script, in, vietnamese, catholic, literature, for, more, than, 200, years, starting, from, the, late, 19th, century, the, vietnamese, alphabet, ch, qu, c, ng, or, national, language, script, gradually, expanded, from, its, initial, usage, in, christian, writing, to, become, more, popular, among, the, general, public, the, romanised, script, became, predominant, over, the, course, of, the, early, 20th, century, when, education, became, widespread, and, a, simpler, writing, system, was, found, to, be, more, expedient, for, teaching, and, communication, with, the, general, population, the, french, colonial, administration, sought, to, eliminate, chinese, writing, confucianism, and, other, chinese, influences, from, vietnam, french, superseded, literary, chinese, in, administration, vietnamese, written, with, the, alphabet, became, required, for, all, public, documents, in, 1910, by, issue, of, a, decree, by, the, french, r, sident, sup, rieur, of, the, protectorate, of, tonkin, in, turn, vietnamese, reformists, and, nationalists, themselves, encouraged, and, popularized, the, use, of, ch, qu, c, ng, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, most, writing, was, done, in, ch, qu, c, ng, which, became, the, official, script, on, independence, nevertheless, ch, h, n, was, still, in, use, during, the, french, colonial, period, and, as, late, as, world, war, ii, was, still, featured, on, banknotes, but, fell, out, of, official, and, mainstream, use, shortly, thereafter, the, education, reform, by, north, vietnam, in, 1950, eliminated, the, use, of, ch, h, n, and, ch, n, m, today, only, a, few, scholars, and, some, extremely, elderly, people, are, able, to, read, ch, n, m, or, use, it, in, vietnamese, calligraphy, priests, of, the, jing, minority, in, china, descendants, of, 16th, century, migrants, from, vietnam, use, songbooks, and, scriptures, written, in, ch, n, m, in, their, ceremonies, the, unicode, character, set, contains, all, vietnamese, characters, and, the, vietnamese, currency, symbol, on, systems, that, do, not, support, unicode, many, 8, bit, vietnamese, code, pages, are, available, such, as, vietnamese, standard, code, for, information, interchange, vscii, or, windows, 1258, where, ascii, must, be, used, vietnamese, letters, are, often, typed, using, the, viqr, convention, though, this, is, largely, unnecessary, with, the, increasing, ubiquity, of, unicode, there, are, many, software, tools, that, help, type, roman, script, vietnamese, on, english, keyboards, such, as, winvnkey, and, unikey, on, windows, or, macvnkey, on, macintosh, with, popular, methods, of, encoding, vietnamese, using, telex, vni, or, viqr, input, methods, all, included, telex, input, method, is, often, set, as, the, default, for, many, devices, besides, third, party, software, tools, operating, systems, such, as, windows, or, macos, can, also, be, installed, with, vietnamese, and, vietnamese, keyboard, e, g, vietnamese, telex, in, microsoft, windows, vietnamese, speak, date, in, the, format, day, month, year, each, month, s, name, is, just, the, ordinal, of, that, month, appended, after, the, word, th, ng, which, means, month, traditional, vietnamese, however, assigns, other, names, to, some, months, these, names, are, mostly, used, in, the, lunar, calendar, and, in, poetry, when, written, in, the, short, form, dd, mm, yyyy, is, preferred, example, the, vietnamese, prefer, writing, numbers, with, a, comma, as, the, decimal, separator, in, lieu, of, dots, and, either, spaces, or, dots, to, group, the, digits, an, example, is, 1, 629, 15, one, thousand, six, hundred, twenty, nine, point, fifteen, because, a, comma, is, used, as, the, decimal, separator, a, semicolon, is, used, to, separate, two, numbers, instead, the, tale, of, ki, u, is, an, epic, narrative, poem, by, the, celebrated, poet, nguy, n, du, which, is, often, considered, the, most, significant, work, of, vietnamese, literature, it, was, originally, written, in, ch, n, m, titled, o, n, tr, ng, t, n, thanh, and, is, widely, taught, in, vietnam, in, ch, qu, c, ng, transliteration, currently, ngu, n, language, is, considered, by, the, vietnamese, government, to, be, a, dialect, of, vietnamese, however, it, is, also, considered, a, separate, vi, t, m, ng, language, or, the, southernmost, dialect, of, m, ng, language, the, vietnamese, language, also, has, several, mutually, intelligible, regional, varieties, vietnamese, has, traditionally, been, divided, into, three, dialect, regions, north, 45, central, 10, and, south, 45, michel, ferlus, and, nguy, n, t, i, c, n, found, that, there, was, a, separate, north, central, dialect, for, vietnamese, as, well, the, term, haut, annam, refers, to, dialects, spoken, from, the, northern, ngh, an, province, to, the, southern, former, th, a, thi, n, province, that, preserve, archaic, features, like, consonant, clusters, and, undiphthongized, vowels, that, have, been, lost, in, other, modern, dialects, the, dialect, regions, differ, mostly, in, their, sound, systems, see, below, but, also, in, vocabulary, including, basic, and, non, basic, vocabulary, and, grammar, the, north, central, and, the, central, regional, varieties, which, have, a, significant, number, of, vocabulary, differences, are, generally, less, mutually, intelligible, to, northern, and, southern, speakers, there, is, less, internal, variation, within, the, southern, region, than, the, other, regions, because, of, its, relatively, late, settlement, by, vietnamese, speakers, around, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, the, north, central, region, is, particularly, conservative, since, its, pronunciation, has, diverged, less, from, vietnamese, orthography, than, the, other, varieties, which, tend, to, merge, certain, sounds, along, the, coastal, areas, regional, variation, has, been, neutralized, to, a, certain, extent, but, more, mountainous, regions, preserve, more, variation, as, for, sociolinguistic, attitudes, the, north, central, varieties, are, often, felt, to, be, peculiar, or, difficult, to, understand, by, speakers, of, other, dialects, although, their, pronunciation, fits, the, written, language, the, most, closely, that, is, typically, because, of, various, words, in, their, vocabulary, that, are, unfamiliar, to, other, speakers, see, the, example, vocabulary, table, below, the, large, movements, of, people, between, north, and, south, since, the, mid, 20th, century, has, resulted, in, a, sizable, number, of, southern, residents, speaking, in, the, northern, accent, dialect, and, to, a, greater, extent, northern, residents, speaking, in, the, southern, accent, dialect, after, the, geneva, accords, of, 1954, which, called, for, the, temporary, division, of, the, country, about, a, million, northerners, mainly, from, hanoi, haiphong, and, the, surrounding, red, river, delta, areas, moved, south, mainly, to, saigon, and, heavily, to, bi, n, h, a, and, v, ng, t, u, and, the, surrounding, areas, as, part, of, operation, passage, to, freedom, about, 180, 000, moved, in, the, reverse, direction, t, p, k, t, ra, b, c, literally, go, to, the, north, after, the, fall, of, saigon, in, 1975, northern, and, north, central, speakers, from, the, densely, populated, red, river, delta, and, the, traditionally, poorer, provinces, of, ngh, an, h, t, nh, and, qu, ng, b, nh, have, continued, to, move, south, to, look, for, better, economic, opportunities, allowed, by, the, new, government, s, new, economic, zones, a, program, that, lasted, from, 1975, to, 1985, the, first, half, of, the, program, 1975, 1980, resulted, in, 1, 3, million, people, sent, to, the, new, economic, zones, nezs, most, of, which, were, relocated, to, the, southern, half, of, the, country, in, previously, uninhabited, areas, and, 550, 000, of, them, were, northerners, the, second, half, 1981, 1985, saw, almost, 1, million, northerners, relocated, to, the, new, economic, zones, government, and, military, personnel, from, northern, and, north, central, vietnam, are, also, posted, to, various, locations, throughout, the, country, that, were, often, away, from, their, home, regions, more, recently, the, growth, of, the, free, market, system, has, resulted, in, increased, interregional, movement, and, relations, between, distant, parts, of, vietnam, through, business, and, travel, the, movements, have, also, resulted, in, some, blending, of, dialects, and, more, significantly, have, made, the, northern, dialect, more, easily, understood, in, the, south, and, vice, versa, most, southerners, when, singing, modern, old, popular, vietnamese, songs, or, addressing, the, public, do, so, in, the, standardized, accent, if, possible, which, uses, the, northern, pronunciation, that, is, true, in, both, vietnam, and, overseas, vietnamese, communities, modern, standard, vietnamese, is, based, on, the, hanoi, dialect, nevertheless, the, major, dialects, are, still, predominant, in, their, respective, areas, and, have, also, evolved, over, time, with, influences, from, other, areas, historically, accents, have, been, distinguished, by, how, each, region, pronounces, the, letters, d, in, the, northern, dialect, and, in, the, central, and, southern, dialect, and, r, in, the, northern, dialect, and, in, the, central, and, southern, dialects, thus, the, central, and, the, southern, dialects, can, be, said, to, have, retained, a, pronunciation, closer, to, vietnamese, orthography, and, resemble, how, middle, vietnamese, sounded, in, contrast, to, the, modern, northern, hanoi, dialect, which, has, since, undergone, pronunciation, shifts, although, regional, variations, developed, over, time, most, of, those, words, can, be, used, interchangeably, and, be, understood, well, albeit, with, more, or, less, frequency, then, others, or, with, slightly, different, but, often, discernible, word, choices, and, pronunciations, some, accents, may, mix, with, words, such, d, v, ng, combining, d, and, v, ng, being, created, the, syllable, initial, ch, and, tr, digraphs, are, pronounced, distinctly, in, the, north, central, central, and, southern, varieties, but, are, merged, in, northern, varieties, which, pronounce, them, the, same, way, many, north, central, varieties, preserve, three, distinct, pronunciations, for, d, gi, and, r, but, the, northern, varieties, have, a, three, way, merger, and, the, central, and, the, southern, varieties, have, a, merger, of, d, and, gi, but, keep, r, distinct, at, the, end, of, syllables, the, palatals, ch, and, nh, have, merged, with, the, alveolars, t, and, n, which, in, turn, have, also, partially,

rural, varieties, in, the, north, variation, between, l, and, n, can, be, found, even, in, mainstream, vietnamese, in, certain, words, for, example, the, numeral, five, appears, as, n, m, by, itself, and, in, compound, numerals, like, n, m, m, i, fifty, but, it, appears, as, l, m, in, m, i, l, m, fifteen, see, vietnamese, grammar, cardinal, in, some, northern, varieties, the, numeral, appears, with, an, initial, nh, instead, of, l, hai, m, i, nh, m, twenty, five, instead, of, the, mainstream, hai, m, i, l, m, there, is, also, a, merger, of, r, and, g, in, certain, rural, varieties, in, the, south, the, consonant, clusters, that, were, originally, present, in, middle, vietnamese, in, the, 17th, century, have, been, lost, in, almost, all, modern, vietnamese, varieties, although, they, have, been, retained, in, other, closely, related, vietic, languages, however, some, speech, communities, have, preserved, some, of, these, archaic, clusters, sky, is, bl, i, with, a, cluster, in, h,

vietnamese, some, tones, may, slightly, merge, but, are, still, highly, distinguishable, from, the, context, of, the, speech, the, h, i, and, ng, tones, are, distinct, in, north, and, some, north, central, varieties, although, often, with, different, pitch, contours, but, have, somewhat, merged, in, the, central, southern, and, some, north, central, varieties, also, with, different, pitch, contours, some, north, central, varieties, such, as, h, t, nh, vietnamese, have, a, slight, merger, of, the, ng, and, n, ng, tones, but, keep, the, h, i, tone, distinct, still, other, north, central, varieties, have, a, three, way, merger, of, h, i, ng, and, n, ng, and, so, have, a, four, tone, system, in, addition, there, are, several, phonetic, differences, mostly, in, pitch, contour, and, phonation, type, in, the, tones, among, the, dialects, the, table, above, shows, the, pitch, contour, of, each, tone, using, chao, tone, number, notation, in, which, 1, represents, the, lowest, pitch,

chain, this, game, involves, two, members, versing, each, other, until, the, opponent, is, unable, to, think, of, another, word, for, instance, another, language, game, known, as, n, i, l, i, is, used, by, vietnamese, speakers, n, i, l, i, involves, switching, adding, or, removing, the, tones, in, a, pair, of, words, and, may, also, involve, switching, the, order, of, words, or, the, first, consonant, and, the, rime, of, each, word, some, examples, the, resulting, transformed, phrase, often, has, a, different, meaning, but, sometimes, may, just, be, a, nonsensical, word, pair, n, i, l, i, can, be, used, to, obscure, the, original, meaning, and, thus, soften, the, discussion, of, a, socially, sensitive, issue, as, with, d, m, i, and, ho, ng, ch, a, above, or, when, implied, and, not, overtly, spoken, to, deliver, a, hidden, subtextual, message, as, with, b, i, t, y, naturally, n, i, l, i, can, be, used, for, a, humorous, effect, another, word, game, somewhat, reminiscent, of, pig, latin, is, played, by, children, here, a, nonsense, syllable, chosen, by, the, child, is, prefixed, onto, a, target, word, s, syllables, then, their, initial, consonants, and, rimes, are, switched, with, the, tone, of, the, original, word, remaining, on, the, new, switched, rime, this, language, game, is, often, used, as, a, secret, or, coded, language, useful, for, obscuring, messages, from,
