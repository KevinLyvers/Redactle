personality, psychology, is, a, branch, of, psychology, that, examines, personality, and, its, variation, among, individuals, it, aims, to, show, how, people, are, individually, different, due, to, psychological, forces, its, areas, of, focus, include, personality, is, a, dynamic, and, organized, set, of, characteristics, possessed, by, an, individual, that, uniquely, influences, their, environment, cognition, emotions, motivations, and, behaviors, in, various, situations, the, word, personality, originates, from, the, latin, persona, which, means, mask, personality, also, pertains, to, the, pattern, of, thoughts, feelings, social, adjustments, and, behaviors, persistently, exhibited, over, time, that, strongly, influences, one, s, expectations, self, perceptions, values, and, attitudes, personality, also, predicts, human, reactions, to, other, people, problems, and, stress, gordon, allport, 1937, described, two, major, ways, to, study, personality, the, nomothetic, and, the, idiographic, nomothetic, psychology, seeks, general, laws, that, can, be, applied, to, many, different, people, such, as, the, principle, of, self, actualization, or, the, trait, of, extraversion, idiographic, psychology, is, an, attempt, to, understand, the, unique, aspects, of, a, particular, individual, the, study, of, personality, has, a, broad, and, varied, history, in, psychology, with, an, abundance, of, theoretical, traditions, the, major, theories, include, dispositional, trait, perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and, social, learning, perspective, many, researchers, and, psychologists, do, not, explicitly, identify, themselves, with, a, certain, perspective, and, instead, take, an, eclectic, approach, research, in, this, area, is, empirically, driven, such, as, dimensional, models, based, on, multivariate, statistics, like, factor, analysis, or, emphasizes, theory, development, such, as, that, of, the, psychodynamic, theory, there, is, also, a, substantial, emphasis, on, the, applied, field, of, personality, testing, in, psychological, education, and, training, the, study, of, the, nature, of, personality, and, its, psychological, development, is, usually, reviewed, as, a, prerequisite, to, courses, in, abnormal, psychology, or, clinical, psychology, many, of, the, ideas, conceptualized, by, historical, and, modern, personality, theorists, stem, from, the, basic, philosophical, assumptions, they, hold, the, study, of, personality, is, not, a, purely, empirical, discipline, as, it, brings, in, elements, of, art, science, and, philosophy, to, draw, general, conclusions, the, following, five, categories, are, some, of, the, most, fundamental, philosophical, assumptions, on, which, theorists, disagree, personality, type, refers, to, the, psychological, classification, of, people, into, different, classes, personality, types, are, distinguished, from, personality, traits, which, come, in, different, degrees, for, example, according, to, type, theories, there, are, two, types, of, people, introverts, and, extroverts, according, to, trait, theories, introversion, and, extroversion, are, part, of, a, continuous, dimension, with, many, people, in, the, middle, personality, is, complex, a, typical, theory, of, personality, contains, several, propositions, or, sub, theories, often, growing, over, time, as, more, psychologists, explore, the, theory, the, most, widely, accepted, empirical, model, of, durable, universal, personality, descriptors, is, the, system, of, big, five, personality, traits, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, to, experience, and, extraversion, introversion, it, is, based, on, cluster, analysis, of, verbal, descriptions, in, self, reporting, surveys, these, traits, demonstrate, considerable, genetic, heritability, perhaps, the, most, ancient, attempt, at, personality, psychology, is, the, personality, typology, outlined, by, the, indian, buddhist, abhidharma, schools, this, typology, mostly, focuses, on, negative, personal, traits, greed, hatred, and, delusion, and, the, corresponding, positive, meditation, practices, used, to, counter, those, traits, an, influential, european, tradition, of, psychological, types, originated, in, the, theoretical, work, of, carl, jung, specifically, in, his, 1921, book, psychologische, typen, psychological, types, and, william, marston, building, on, the, writings, and, observations, of, jung, during, world, war, ii, isabel, briggs, myers, and, her, mother, katharine, c, briggs, delineated, personality, types, by, constructing, the, myers, briggs, type, indicator, this, model, was, later, used, by, david, keirsey, with, a, different, understanding, from, jung, briggs, and, myers, in, the, former, soviet, union, lithuanian, au, ra, augustinavi, i, t, independently, derived, a, model, of, personality, type, from, jung, s, called, socionics, later, on, many, other, tests, were, developed, on, this, model, e, g, golden, pti, pro, and, jti, theories, could, also, be, considered, an, approach, to, personality, or, psychology, and, is, generally, referred, to, as, a, model, the, model, is, an, older, and, more, theoretical, approach, to, personality, accepting, extroversion, and, introversion, as, basic, psychological, orientations, in, connection, with, two, pairs, of, psychological, functions, briggs, and, myers, also, added, another, personality, dimension, to, their, type, indicator, to, measure, whether, a, person, prefers, to, use, a, judging, or, perceiving, function, when, interacting, with, the, external, world, therefore, they, included, questions, designed, to, indicate, whether, someone, wishes, to, come, to, conclusions, judgement, or, to, keep, options, open, perception, this, personality, typology, has, some, aspects, of, a, trait, theory, it, explains, people, s, behavior, in, terms, of, opposite, fixed, characteristics, in, these, more, traditional, models, the, sensing, intuition, preference, is, considered, the, most, basic, dividing, people, into, n, intuitive, or, s, sensing, personality, types, an, n, is, further, assumed, to, be, guided, either, by, thinking, or, feeling, and, divided, into, the, nt, scientist, engineer, or, nf, author, humanitarian, temperament, an, s, in, contrast, is, assumed, to, be, guided, more, by, the, judgment, perception, axis, and, thus, divided, into, the, sj, guardian, traditionalist, or, sp, performer, artisan, temperament, these, four, are, considered, basic, with, the, other, two, factors, in, each, case, including, always, extraversion, introversion, less, important, critics, of, this, traditional, view, have, observed, that, the, types, can, be, quite, strongly, stereotyped, by, professions, although, neither, myers, nor, keirsey, engaged, in, such, stereotyping, in, their, type, descriptions, and, thus, may, arise, more, from, the, need, to, categorize, people, for, purposes, of, guiding, their, career, choice, this, among, other, objections, led, to, the, emergence, of, the, five, factor, view, which, is, less, concerned, with, behavior, under, work, conditions, and, more, concerned, with, behavior, in, personal, and, emotional, circumstances, the, mbti, is, not, designed, to, measure, the, work, self, but, rather, what, myers, and, mccaulley, called, the, shoes, off, self, type, a, and, type, b, personality, theory, during, the, 1950s, meyer, friedman, and, his, co, workers, defined, what, they, called, type, a, and, type, b, behavior, patterns, they, theorized, that, intense, hard, driving, type, a, personalities, had, a, higher, risk, of, coronary, disease, because, they, are, stress, junkies, type, b, people, on, the, other, hand, tended, to, be, relaxed, less, competitive, and, lower, in, risk, there, was, also, a, type, ab, mixed, profile, health, psychology, a, field, of, study, has, been, influenced, by, the, type, a, and, type, b, personality, theories, which, reveal, how, personality, traits, can, impact, cardiovascular, health, type, a, individuals, known, for, their, competitiveness, and, urgency, may, increase, the, risk, of, conditions, like, high, blood, pressure, and, coronary, heart, disease, day, and, jreige, 2002, investigate, the, type, a, behavior, pattern, as, a, mediator, in, the, relationship, between, job, stressors, and, psychosocial, outcomes, their, study, published, in, the, journal, of, occupational, health, psychology, demonstrates, that, individuals, exhibiting, type, a, characteristics, are, more, susceptible, to, adverse, psychosocial, effects, such, as, increased, stress, and, lower, job, satisfaction, when, exposed, to, workplace, stressors, this, research, highlights, the, importance, of, considering, personality, traits, in, managing, occupational, health, eduard, spranger, s, personality, model, consisting, of, six, or, by, some, revisions, 6, 1, basic, types, of, value, attitudes, described, in, his, book, types, of, men, lebensformen, halle, saale, niemeyer, 1914, english, translation, by, p, j, w, pigors, new, york, g, e, stechert, company, 1928, the, enneagram, of, personality, a, model, of, human, personality, which, is, principally, used, as, a, typology, of, nine, interconnected, personality, types, it, has, been, criticized, as, being, subject, to, interpretation, making, it, difficult, to, test, or, validate, scientifically, john, l, holland, s, riasec, vocational, model, commonly, referred, to, as, the, holland, codes, focuses, specifically, on, choice, of, occupation, it, proposes, that, six, personality, types, lead, people, to, choose, their, career, paths, in, this, circumplex, model, the, six, types, are, represented, as, a, hexagon, with, adjacent, types, more, closely, related, than, those, more, distant, the, model, is, widely, used, in, vocational, counseling, psychoanalytic, theories, explain, human, behavior, in, terms, of, the, interaction, of, various, components, of, personality, sigmund, freud, was, the, founder, of, this, school, of, thought, he, drew, on, the, physics, of, his, day, thermodynamics, to, coin, the, term, psychodynamics, based, on, the, idea, of, converting, heat, into, mechanical, energy, freud, proposed, psychic, energy, could, be, converted, into, behavior, his, theory, places, central, importance, on, dynamic, unconscious, psychological, conflicts, freud, divides, human, personality, into, three, significant, components, the, id, ego, and, super, ego, the, id, acts, according, to, the, pleasure, principle, demanding, immediate, gratification, of, its, needs, regardless, of, external, environment, the, ego, then, must, emerge, in, order, to, realistically, meet, the, wishes, and, demands, of, the, id, in, accordance, with, the, outside, world, adhering, to, the, reality, principle, finally, the, superego, conscience, inculcates, moral, judgment, and, societal, rules, upon, the, ego, thus, forcing, the, demands, of, the, id, to, be, met, not, only, realistically, but, morally, the, superego, is, the, last, function, of, the, personality, to, develop, and, is, the, embodiment, of, parental, social, ideals, established, during, childhood, according, to, freud, personality, is, based, on, the, dynamic, interactions, of, these, three, components, the, channeling, and, release, of, sexual, libidal, and, aggressive, energies, which, ensues, from, the, eros, sex, instinctual, self, preservation, and, thanatos, death, instinctual, self, annihilation, drives, respectively, are, major, components, of, his, theory, freud, s, broad, understanding, of, sexuality, included, all, kinds, of, pleasurable, feelings, experienced, by, the, human, body, freud, proposed, five, psychosexual, stages, of, personality, development, he, believed, adult, personality, is, dependent, upon, early, childhood, experiences, and, largely, determined, by, age, five, fixations, that, develop, during, the, infantile, stage, contribute, to, adult, personality, and, behavior, one, of, sigmund, freud, s, earlier, associates, alfred, adler, agreed, with, freud, that, early, childhood, experiences, are, important, to, development, and, believed, birth, order, may, influence, personality, development, adler, believed, that, the, oldest, child, was, the, individual, who, would, set, high, achievement, goals, in, order, to, gain, attention, lost, when, the, younger, siblings, were, born, he, believed, the, middle, children, were, competitive, and, ambitious, he, reasoned, that, this, behavior, was, motivated, by, the, idea, of, surpassing, the, firstborn, s, achievements, he, added, however, that, the, middle, children, were, often, not, as, concerned, about, the, glory, attributed, to, their, behavior, he, also, believed, the, youngest, would, be, more, dependent, and, sociable, adler, finished, by, surmising, that, an, only, child, loves, being, the, center, of, attention, and, matures, quickly, but, in, the, end, fails, to, become, independent, heinz, kohut, thought, similarly, to, freud, s, idea, of, transference, he, used, narcissism, as, a, model, of, how, people, develop, their, sense, of, self, narcissism, is, the, exaggerated, sense, of, self, in, which, one, is, believed, to, exist, in, order, to, protect, one, s, low, self, esteem, and, sense, of, worthlessness, kohut, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, field, by, extending, freud, s, theory, of, narcissism, and, introducing, what, he, called, the, self, object, transferences, of, mirroring, and, idealization, in, other, words, children, need, to, idealize, and, emotionally, sink, into, and, identify, with, the, idealized, competence, of, admired, figures, such, as, parents, or, older, siblings, they, also, need, to, have, their, self, worth, mirrored, by, these, people, such, experiences, allow, them, to, thereby, learn, the, self, soothing, and, other, skills, that, are, necessary, for, the, development, of, a, healthy, sense, of, self, another, important, figure, in, the, world, of, personality, theory, is, karen, horney, she, is, credited, with, the, development, of, feminist, psychology, she, disagrees, with, freud, on, some, key, points, one, being, that, women, s, personalities, are, not, just, a, function, of, penis, envy, but, that, girl, children, have, separate, and, different, psychic, lives, unrelated, to, how, they, feel, about, their, fathers, or, primary, male, role, models, she, talks, about, three, basic, neurotic, needs, basic, anxiety, basic, hostility, and, basic, evil, she, posits, that, to, any, anxiety, an, individual, experiences, they, would, have, one, of, three, approaches, moving, toward, people, moving, away, from, people, or, moving, against, people, it, is, these, three, that, give, us, varying, personality, types, and, characteristics, she, also, places, a, high, premium, on, concepts, like, overvaluation, of, love, and, romantic, partners, behaviorists, explain, personality, in, terms, of, the, effects, external, stimuli, have, on, behavior, the, approaches, used, to, evaluate, the, behavioral, aspect, of, personality, are, known, as, behavioral, theories, or, learning, conditioning, theories, these, approaches, were, a, radical, shift, away, from, freudian, philosophy, one, of, the, major, tenets, of, this, concentration, of, personality, psychology, is, a, strong, emphasis, on, scientific, thinking, and, experimentation, this, school, of, thought, was, developed, by, b, f, skinner, who, put, forth, a, model, which, emphasized, the, mutual, interaction, of, the, person, or, the, organism, with, its, environment, skinner, believed, children, do, bad, things, because, the, behavior, obtains, attention, that, serves, as, a, reinforcer, for, example, a, child, cries, because, the, child, s, crying, in, the, past, has, led, to, attention, these, are, the, response, and, consequences, the, response, is, the, child, crying, and, the, attention, that, child, gets, is, the, reinforcing, consequence, according, to, this, theory, people, s, behavior, is, formed, by, processes, such, as, operant, conditioning, skinner, put, forward, a, three, term, contingency, model, which, helped, promote, analysis, of, behavior, based, on, the, stimulus, response, consequence, model, in, which, the, critical, question, is, under, which, circumstances, or, antecedent, stimuli, does, the, organism, engage, in, a, particular, behavior, or, response, which, in, turn, produces, a, particular, consequence, richard, herrnstein, extended, this, theory, by, accounting, for, attitudes, and, traits, an, attitude, develops, as, the, response, strength, the, tendency, to, respond, in, the, presences, of, a, group, of, stimuli, become, stable, rather, than, describing, conditionable, traits, in, non, behavioral, language, response, strength, in, a, given, situation, accounts, for, the, environmental, portion, herrstein, also, saw, traits, as, having, a, large, genetic, or, biological, component, as, do, most, modern, behaviorists, ivan, pavlov, is, another, notable, influence, he, is, well, known, for, his, classical, conditioning, experiments, involving, dogs, which, led, him, to, discover, the, foundation, of, behaviorism, in, cognitive, theory, behavior, is, explained, as, guided, by, cognitions, e, g, expectations, about, the, world, especially, those, about, other, people, cognitive, theories, are, theories, of, personality, that, emphasize, cognitive, processes, such, as, thinking, and, judging, albert, bandura, a, social, learning, theorist, suggested, the, forces, of, memory, and, emotions, worked, in, conjunction, with, environmental, influences, bandura, was, known, mostly, for, his, bobo, doll, experiment, during, these, experiments, bandura, video, taped, a, college, student, kicking, and, verbally, abusing, a, bobo, doll, he, then, showed, this, video, to, a, class, of, kindergarten, children, who, were, getting, ready, to, go, out, to, play, when, they, entered, the, play, room, they, saw, bobo, dolls, and, some, hammers, the, people, observing, these, children, at, play, saw, a, group, of, children, beating, the, doll, he, called, this, study, and, his, findings, observational, learning, or, modeling, early, examples, of, approaches, to, cognitive, style, are, listed, by, baron, 1982, these, include, witkin, s, 1965, work, on, field, dependency, gardner, s, 1953, discovering, people, had, consistent, preference, for, the, number, of, categories, they, used, to, categorize, heterogeneous, objects, and, block, and, petersen, s, 1955, work, on, confidence, in, line, discrimination, judgments, baron, relates, early, development, of, cognitive, approaches, of, personality, to, ego, psychology, more, central, to, this, field, have, been, various, scales, have, been, developed, to, assess, both, attributional, style, and, locus, of, control, locus, of, control, scales, include, those, used, by, rotter, and, later, by, duttweiler, the, nowicki, and, strickland, 1973, locus, of, control, scale, for, children, and, various, locus, of, control, scales, specifically, in, the, health, domain, most, famously, that, of, kenneth, wallston, and, his, colleagues, the, multidimensional, health, locus, of, control, scale, attributional, style, has, been, assessed, by, the, attributional, style, questionnaire, the, expanded, attributional, style, questionnaire, the, attributions, questionnaire, the, real, events, attributional, style, questionnaire, and, the, attributional, style, assessment, test, recognition, that, the, tendency, to, believe, that, hard, work, and, persistence, often, results, in, attainment, of, life, and, academic, goals, has, influenced, formal, educational, and, counseling, efforts, with, students, of, various, ages, and, in, various, settings, since, the, 1970s, research, about, achievement, counseling, aimed, toward, encouraging, individuals, to, design, ambitious, goals, and, work, toward, them, with, recognition, that, there, are, external, factors, that, may, impact, often, results, in, the, incorporation, of, a, more, positive, achievement, style, by, students, and, employees, whatever, the, setting, to, include, higher, education, workplace, or, justice, programming, walter, mischel, 1999, has, also, defended, a, cognitive, approach, to, personality, his, work, refers, to, cognitive, affective, units, and, considers, factors, such, as, encoding, of, stimuli, affect, goal, setting, and, self, regulatory, beliefs, the, term, cognitive, affective, units, shows, how, his, approach, considers, affect, as, well, as, cognition, cognitive, experiential, self, theory, cest, is, another, cognitive, personality, theory, developed, by, seymour, epstein, cest, argues, that, humans, operate, by, way, of, two, independent, information, processing, systems, experiential, system, and, rational, system, the, experiential, system, is, fast, and, emotion, driven, the, rational, system, is, slow, and, logic, driven, these, two, systems, interact, to, determine, our, goals, thoughts, and, behavior, personal, construct, psychology, pcp, is, a, theory, of, personality, developed, by, the, american, psychologist, george, kelly, in, the, 1950s, kelly, s, fundamental, view, of, personality, was, that, people, are, like, naive, scientists, who, see, the, world, through, a, particular, lens, based, on, their, uniquely, organized, systems, of, construction, which, they, use, to, anticipate, events, but, because, people, are, naive, scientists, they, sometimes, employ, systems, for, construing, the, world, that, are, distorted, by, idiosyncratic, experiences, not, applicable, to, their, current, social, situation, a, system, of, construction, that, chronically, fails, to, characterize, and, or, predict, events, and, is, not, appropriately, revised, to, comprehend, and, predict, one, s, changing, social, world, is, considered, to, underlie, psychopathology, mental, disorders, from, the, theory, kelly, derived, a, psychotherapy, approach, and, also, a, technique, called, the, repertory, grid, interview, that, helped, his, patients, to, uncover, their, own, constructs, with, minimal, intervention, or, interpretation, by, the, therapist, the, repertory, grid, was, later, adapted, for, various, uses, within, organizations, including, decision, making, and, interpretation, of, other, people, s, world, views, humanistic, psychology, emphasizes, that, people, have, free, will, and, that, this, plays, an, active, role, in, determining, how, they, behave, accordingly, humanistic, psychology, focuses, on, subjective, experiences, of, persons, as, opposed, to, forced, definitive, factors, that, determine, behavior, abraham, maslow, and, carl, rogers, were, proponents, of, this, view, which, is, based, on, the, phenomenal, field, theory, of, combs, and, snygg, 1949, rogers, and, maslow, were, among, a, group, of, psychologists, that, worked, together, for, a, decade, to, produce, the, journal, of, humanistic, psychology, this, journal, was, primarily, focused, on, viewing, individuals, as, a, whole, rather, than, focusing, solely, on, separate, traits, and, processes, within, the, individual, robert, w, white, wrote, the, book, the, abnormal, personality, that, became, a, standard, text, on, abnormal, psychology, he, also, investigated, the, human, need, to, strive, for, positive, goals, like, competence, and, influence, to, counterbalance, the, emphasis, of, freud, on, the, pathological, elements, of, personality, development, maslow, spent, much, of, his, time, studying, what, he, called, self, actualizing, persons, those, who, are, fulfilling, themselves, and, doing, the, best, they, are, capable, of, doing, maslow, believes, all, who, are, interested, in, growth, move, towards, self, actualizing, growth, happiness, satisfaction, views, many, of, these, people, demonstrate, a, trend, in, dimensions, of, their, personalities, characteristics, of, self, actualizers, according, to, maslow, include, the, four, key, dimensions, maslow, and, rogers, emphasized, a, view, of, the, person, as, an, active, creative, experiencing, human, being, who, lives, in, the, present, and, subjectively, responds, to, current, perceptions, relationships, and, encounters, they, disagree, with, the, dark, pessimistic, outlook, of, those, in, the, freudian, psychoanalysis, ranks, but, rather, view, humanistic, theories, as, positive, and, optimistic, proposals, which, stress, the, tendency, of, the, human, personality, toward, growth, and, self, actualization, this, progressing, self, will, remain, the, center, of, its, constantly, changing, world, a, world, that, will, help, mold, the, self, but, not, necessarily, confine, it, rather, the, self, has, opportunity, for, maturation, based, on, its, encounters, with, this, world, this, understanding, attempts, to, reduce, the, acceptance, of, hopeless, redundancy, humanistic, therapy, typically, relies, on, the, client, for, information, of, the, past, and, its, effect, on, the, present, therefore, the, client, dictates, the, type, of, guidance, the, therapist, may, initiate, this, allows, for, an, individualized, approach, to, therapy, rogers, found, patients, differ, in, how, they, respond, to, other, people, rogers, tried, to, model, a, particular, approach, to, therapy, he, stressed, the, reflective, or, empathetic, response, this, response, type, takes, the, client, s, viewpoint, and, reflects, back, their, feeling, and, the, context, for, it, an, example, of, a, reflective, response, would, be, it, seems, you, are, feeling, anxious, about, your, upcoming, marriage, this, response, type, seeks, to, clarify, the, therapist, s, understanding, while, also, encouraging, the, client, to, think, more, deeply, and, seek, to, fully, understand, the, feelings, they, have, expressed, biology, plays, a, very, important, role, in, the, development, of, personality, the, study, of, the, biological, level, in, personality, psychology, focuses, primarily, on, identifying, the, role, of, genetic, determinants, and, how, they, mold, individual, personalities, some, of, the, earliest, thinking, about, possible, biological, bases, of, personality, grew, out, of, the, case, of, phineas, gage, in, an, 1848, accident, a, large, iron, rod, was, driven, through, gage, s, head, and, his, personality, apparently, changed, as, a, result, although, descriptions, of, these, psychological, changes, are, usually, exaggerated, in, general, patients, with, brain, damage, have, been, difficult, to, find, and, study, in, the, 1990s, researchers, began, to, use, electroencephalography, eeg, positron, emission, tomography, pet, and, more, recently, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, which, is, now, the, most, widely, used, imaging, technique, to, help, localize, personality, traits, in, the, brain, this, line, of, research, has, led, to, the, developing, field, of, personality, neuroscience, which, uses, neuroscientific, methods, to, study, the, neural, underpinnings, of, personality, traits, ever, since, the, human, genome, project, allowed, for, a, much, more, in, depth, comprehension, of, genetics, there, has, been, an, ongoing, controversy, involving, heritability, personality, traits, and, environmental, vs, genetic, influence, on, personality, the, human, genome, is, known, to, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, personality, previously, genetic, personality, studies, focused, on, specific, genes, correlating, to, specific, personality, traits, today, s, view, of, the, gene, personality, relationship, focuses, primarily, on, the, activation, and, expression, of, genes, related, to, personality, and, forms, part, of, what, is, referred, to, as, behavioral, genetics, genes, provide, numerous, options, for, varying, cells, to, be, expressed, however, the, environment, determines, which, of, these, are, activated, many, studies, have, noted, this, relationship, in, varying, ways, in, which, our, bodies, can, develop, but, the, interaction, between, genes, and, the, shaping, of, our, minds, and, personality, is, also, relevant, to, this, biological, relationship, dna, environment, interactions, are, important, in, the, development, of, personality, because, this, relationship, determines, what, part, of, the, dna, code, is, actually, made, into, proteins, that, will, become, part, of, an, individual, while, different, choices, are, made, available, by, the, genome, in, the, end, the, environment, is, the, ultimate, determinant, of, what, becomes, activated, small, changes, in, dna, in, individuals, are, what, leads, to, the, uniqueness, of, every, person, as, well, as, differences, in, looks, abilities, brain, functioning, and, all, the, factors, that, culminate, to, develop, a, cohesive, personality, cattell, and, eysenck, have, proposed, that, genetics, have, a, powerful, influence, on, personality, a, large, part, of, the, evidence, collected, linking, genetics, and, the, environment, to, personality, have, come, from, twin, studies, this, twin, method, compares, levels, of, similarity, in, personality, using, genetically, identical, twins, one, of, the, first, of, these, twin, studies, measured, 800, pairs, of, twins, studied, numerous, personality, traits, and, determined, that, identical, twins, are, most, similar, in, their, general, abilities, personality, similarities, were, found, to, be, less, related, for, self, concepts, goals, and, interests, twin, studies, have, also, been, important, in, the, creation, of, the, five, factor, personality, model, neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and, extraversion, are, the, two, most, widely, studied, traits, individuals, scoring, high, in, trait, extraversion, more, often, display, characteristics, such, as, impulsiveness, sociability, and, activeness, individuals, scoring, high, in, trait, neuroticism, are, more, likely, to, be, moody, anxious, or, irritable, identical, twins, however, have, higher, correlations, in, personality, traits, than, fraternal, twins, one, study, measuring, genetic, influence, on, twins, in, five, different, countries, found, that, the, correlations, for, identical, twins, were, 50, while, for, fraternal, they, were, about, 20, it, is, suggested, that, heredity, and, environment, interact, to, determine, one, s, personality, charles, darwin, is, the, founder, of, the, theory, of, the, evolution, of, the, species, the, evolutionary, approach, to, personality, psychology, is, based, on, this, theory, this, theory, examines, how, individual, personality, differences, are, based, on, natural, selection, through, natural, selection, organisms, change, over, time, through, adaptation, and, selection, traits, are, developed, and, certain, genes, come, into, expression, based, on, an, organism, s, environment, and, how, these, traits, aid, in, an, organism, s, survival, and, reproduction, polymorphisms, such, as, sex, and, blood, type, are, forms, of, diversity, which, evolve, to, benefit, a, species, as, a, whole, the, theory, of, evolution, has, wide, ranging, implications, on, personality, psychology, personality, viewed, through, the, lens, of, evolutionary, biology, places, a, great, deal, of, emphasis, on, specific, traits, that, are, most, likely, to, aid, in, survival, and, reproduction, such, as, conscientiousness, sociability, emotional, stability, and, dominance, the, social, aspects, of, personality, can, be, seen, through, an, evolutionary, perspective, specific, character, traits, develop, and, are, selected, for, because, they, play, an, important, and, complex, role, in, the, social, hierarchy, of, organisms, such, characteristics, of, this, social, hierarchy, include, the, sharing, of, important, resources, family, and, mating, interactions, and, the, harm, or, help, organisms, can, bestow, upon, one, another, in, the, 1930s, john, dollard, and, neal, elgar, miller, met, at, yale, university, and, began, an, attempt, to, integrate, drives, see, drive, theory, into, a, theory, of, personality, basing, themselves, on, the, work, of, clark, hull, they, began, with, the, premise, that, personality, could, be, equated, with, the, habitual, responses, exhibited, by, an, individual, their, habits, from, there, they, determined, that, these, habitual, responses, were, built, on, secondary, or, acquired, drives, secondary, drives, are, internal, needs, directing, the, behavior, of, an, individual, that, results, from, learning, acquired, drives, are, learned, by, and, large, in, the, manner, described, by, classical, conditioning, when, we, are, in, a, certain, environment, and, experience, a, strong, response, to, a, stimulus, we, internalize, cues, from, the, said, environment, when, we, find, ourselves, in, an, environment, with, similar, cues, we, begin, to, act, in, anticipation, of, a, similar, stimulus, thus, we, are, likely, to, experience, anxiety, in, an, environment, with, cues, similar, to, one, where, we, have, experienced, pain, or, fear, such, as, the, dentist, s, office, secondary, drives, are, built, on, primary, drives, which, are, biologically, driven, and, motivate, us, to, act, with, no, prior, learning, process, such, as, hunger, thirst, or, the, need, for, sexual, activity, however, secondary, drives, are, thought, to, represent, more, specific, elaborations, of, primary, drives, behind, which, the, functions, of, the, original, primary, drive, continue, to, exist, thus, the, primary, drives, of, fear, and, pain, exist, behind, the, acquired, drive, of, anxiety, secondary, drives, can, be, based, on, multiple, primary, drives, and, even, in, other, secondary, drives, this, is, said, to, give, them, strength, and, persistence, examples, include, the, need, for, money, which, was, conceptualized, as, arising, from, multiple, primary, drives, such, as, the, drive, for, food, and, warmth, as, well, as, from, secondary, drives, such, as, imitativeness, the, drive, to, do, as, others, do, and, anxiety, secondary, drives, vary, based, on, the, social, conditions, under, which, they, were, learned, such, as, culture, dollard, and, miller, used, the, example, of, food, stating, that, the, primary, drive, of, hunger, manifested, itself, behind, the, learned, secondary, drive, of, an, appetite, for, a, specific, type, of, food, which, was, dependent, on, the, culture, of, the, individual, secondary, drives, are, also, explicitly, social, representing, a, manner, in, which, we, convey, our, primary, drives, to, others, indeed, many, primary, drives, are, actively, repressed, by, society, such, as, the, sexual, drive, dollard, and, miller, believed, that, the, acquisition, of, secondary, drives, was, essential, to, childhood, development, as, children, develop, they, learn, not, to, act, on, their, primary, drives, such, as, hunger, but, acquire, secondary, drives, through, reinforcement, friedman, and, schustack, describe, an, example, of, such, developmental, changes, stating, that, if, an, infant, engaging, in, an, active, orientation, towards, others, brings, about, the, fulfillment, of, primary, drives, such, as, being, fed, or, having, their, diaper, changed, they, will, develop, a, secondary, drive, to, pursue, similar, interactions, with, others, perhaps, leading, to, an, individual, being, more, gregarious, dollard, and, miller, s, belief, in, the, importance, of, acquired, drives, led, them, to, reconceive, sigmund, freud, s, theory, of, psychosexual, development, they, found, themselves, to, be, in, agreement, with, the, timing, freud, used, but, believed, that, these, periods, corresponded, to, the, successful, learning, of, certain, secondary, drives, dollard, and, miller, gave, many, examples, of, how, secondary, drives, impact, our, habitual, responses, and, by, extension, our, personalities, including, anger, social, conformity, imitativeness, or, anxiety, to, name, a, few, in, the, case, of, anxiety, dollard, and, miller, note, that, people, who, generalize, the, situation, in, which, they, experience, the, anxiety, drive, will, experience, anxiety, far, more, than, they, should, these, people, are, often, anxious, all, the, time, and, anxiety, becomes, part, of, their, personality, this, example, shows, how, drive, theory, can, have, ties, with, other, theories, of, personality, many, of, them, look, at, the, trait, of, neuroticism, or, emotional, stability, in, people, which, is, strongly, linked, to, anxiety, there, are, two, major, types, of, personality, tests, projective, and, objective, projective, tests, assume, personality, is, primarily, unconscious, and, assess, individuals, by, how, they, respond, to, an, ambiguous, stimulus, such, as, an, ink, blot, projective, tests, have, been, in, use, for, about, 60, years, and, continue, to, be, used, today, examples, of, such, tests, include, the, rorschach, test, and, the, thematic, apperception, test, the, rorschach, test, involves, showing, an, individual, a, series, of, note, cards, with, ambiguous, ink, blots, on, them, the, individual, being, tested, is, asked, to, provide, interpretations, of, the, blots, on, the, cards, by, stating, everything, that, the, ink, blot, may, resemble, based, on, their, personal, interpretation, the, therapist, then, analyzes, their, responses, rules, for, scoring, the, test, have, been, covered, in, manuals, that, cover, a, wide, variety, of, characteristics, such, as, content, originality, of, response, location, of, perceived, images, and, several, other, factors, using, these, specific, scoring, methods, the, therapist, will, then, attempt, to, relate, test, responses, to, attributes, of, the, individual, s, personality, and, their, unique, characteristics, the, idea, is, that, unconscious, needs, will, come, out, in, the, person, s, response, e, g, an, aggressive, person, may, see, images, of, destruction, the, thematic, apperception, test, tat, involves, presenting, individuals, with, vague, pictures, scenes, and, asking, them, to, tell, a, story, based, on, what, they, see, common, examples, of, these, scenes, include, images, that, may, suggest, family, relationships, or, specific, situations, such, as, a, father, and, son, or, a, man, and, a, woman, in, a, bedroom, responses, are, analyzed, for, common, themes, responses, unique, to, an, individual, are, theoretically, meant, to, indicate, underlying, thoughts, processes, and, potentially, conflicts, present, within, the, individual, responses, are, believed, to, be, directly, linked, to, unconscious, motives, there, is, very, little, empirical, evidence, available, to, support, these, methods, objective, tests, assume, personality, is, consciously, accessible, and, that, it, can, be, measured, by, self, report, questionnaires, research, on, psychological, assessment, has, generally, found, objective, tests, to, be, more, valid, and, reliable, than, projective, tests, critics, have, pointed, to, the, forer, effect, to, suggest, some, of, these, appear, to, be, more, accurate, and, discriminating, than, they, really, are, issues, with, these, tests, include, false, reporting, because, there, is, no, way, to, tell, if, an, individual, is, answering, a, question, honestly, or, accurately, the, myers, briggs, type, indicator, also, known, as, the, mbti, is, self, reporting, questionnaire, based, on, carl, jung, s, psychological, types, however, the, mbti, modified, jung, s, theory, into, their, own, by, disregarding, certain, processes, held, in, the, unconscious, mind, and, the, impact, these, have, on, personality, psychology, has, traditionally, defined, personality, through, its, behavioral, patterns, and, more, recently, with, neuroscientific, studies, of, the, brain, in, recent, years, some, psychologists, have, turned, to, the, study, of, inner, experiences, for, insight, into, personality, as, well, as, individuality, inner, experiences, are, the, thoughts, and, feelings, to, an, immediate, phenomenon, another, term, used, to, define, inner, experiences, is, qualia, being, able, to, understand, inner, experiences, assists, in, understanding, how, humans, behave, act, and, respond, defining, personality, using, inner, experiences, has, been, expanding, due, to, the, fact, that, solely, relying, on, behavioral, principles, to, explain, one, s, character, may, seem, incomplete, behavioral, methods, allow, the, subject, to, be, observed, by, an, observer, whereas, with, inner, experiences, the, subject, is, its, own, observer, descriptive, experience, sampling, des, developed, by, psychologist, russel, hurlburt, this, is, an, idiographic, method, that, is, used, to, help, examine, inner, experiences, this, method, relies, on, an, introspective, technique, that, allows, an, individual, s, inner, experiences, and, characteristics, to, be, described, and, measured, a, beep, notifies, the, subject, to, record, their, experience, at, that, exact, moment, and, 24, hours, later, an, interview, is, given, based, on, all, the, experiences, recorded, des, has, been, used, in, subjects, that, have, been, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, and, depression, it, has, also, been, crucial, to, studying, the, inner, experiences, of, those, who, have, been, diagnosed, with, common, psychiatric, diseases, articulated, thoughts, in, stimulated, situations, atss, atss, is, a, paradigm, which, was, created, as, an, alternative, to, the, ta, think, aloud, method, this, method, assumes, that, people, have, continuous, internal, dialogues, that, can, be, naturally, attended, to, atss, also, assesses, a, person, s, inner, thoughts, as, they, verbalize, their, cognitions, in, this, procedure, subjects, listen, to, a, scenario, via, a, video, or, audio, player, and, are, asked, to, imagine, that, they, are, in, that, specific, situation, later, they, are, asked, to, articulate, their, thoughts, as, they, occur, in, reaction, to, the, playing, scenario, this, method, is, useful, in, studying, emotional, experience, given, that, the, scenarios, used, can, influence, specific, emotions, most, importantly, the, method, has, contributed, to, the, study, of, personality, in, a, study, conducted, by, rayburn, and, davison, 2002, subjects, thoughts, and, empathy, toward, anti, gay, hate, crimes, were, evaluated, the, researchers, found, that, participants, showed, more, aggressive, intentions, towards, the, offender, in, scenarios, which, mimicked, hate, crimes, experimental, method, this, method, is, an, experimental, paradigm, used, to, study, human, experiences, involved, in, the, studies, of, sensation, and, perception, learning, and, memory, motivation, and, biological, psychology, the, experimental, psychologist, usually, deals, with, intact, organisms, although, studies, are, often, conducted, with, organisms, modified, by, surgery, radiation, drug, treatment, or, long, standing, deprivations, of, various, kinds, or, with, organisms, that, naturally, present, organic, abnormalities, or, emotional, disorders, economists, and, psychologists, have, developed, a, variety, of, experimental, methodologies, to, elicit, and, assess, individual, attitudes, where, each, emotion, differs, for, each, individual, the, results, are, then, gathered, and, quantified, to, conclude, if, specific, experiences, have, any, common, factors, this, method, is, used, to, seek, clarity, of, the, experience, and, remove, any, biases, to, help, understand, the, meaning, behind, the, experience, to, see, if, it, can, be, generalized, the, experimental, method, does, have, some, complications, though, if, researchers, are, manipulating, a, variable, it, s, possible, this, change, will, affect, a, different, variable, which, in, turn, will, change, the, measured, result, not, the, original, manipulated, condition, introducing, uncertainty, this, method, in, personality, research, often, requires, deception, so, the, ethics, of, experiments, are, also, brought, into, question
