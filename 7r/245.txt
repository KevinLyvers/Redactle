the, iroquois, r, k, w, k, w, irr, kwoy, kwah, also, known, as, the, five, nations, and, later, as, the, six, nations, from, 1722, onwards, alternatively, referred, to, by, the, endonym, haudenosaunee, h, o, d, n, o, o, n, i, hoh, din, oh, shoh, nee, lit, people, who, are, building, the, longhouse, are, an, iroquoian, speaking, confederacy, of, native, americans, and, first, nations, peoples, in, northeast, north, america, they, were, known, by, the, french, during, the, colonial, years, as, the, iroquois, league, and, later, as, the, iroquois, confederacy, while, the, english, simply, called, them, the, five, nations, the, peoples, of, the, iroquois, included, from, east, to, west, the, mohawk, oneida, onondaga, cayuga, and, seneca, after, 1722, the, iroquoian, speaking, tuscarora, people, from, the, southeast, were, accepted, into, the, confederacy, from, which, point, it, was, known, as, the, six, nations, the, confederacy, likely, came, about, between, the, years, 1450, ce, and, 1660, ce, as, a, result, of, the, great, law, of, peace, said, to, have, been, composed, by, the, deganawidah, the, great, peacemaker, hiawatha, and, jigonsaseh, the, mother, of, nations, for, nearly, 200, years, the, six, nations, haudenosaunee, confederacy, were, a, powerful, factor, in, north, american, colonial, policy, with, some, scholars, arguing, for, the, concept, of, the, middle, ground, in, that, european, powers, were, used, by, the, iroquois, just, as, much, as, europeans, used, them, at, its, peak, around, 1700, iroquois, power, extended, from, what, is, today, new, york, state, north, into, present, day, ontario, and, quebec, along, the, lower, great, lakes, upper, st, lawrence, and, south, on, both, sides, of, the, allegheny, mountains, into, present, day, virginia, and, kentucky, and, into, the, ohio, valley, the, st, lawrence, iroquoians, wendat, huron, erie, and, susquehannock, all, independent, peoples, known, to, the, european, colonists, also, spoke, iroquoian, languages, they, are, considered, iroquoian, in, a, larger, cultural, sense, all, being, descended, from, the, proto, iroquoian, people, and, language, historically, however, they, were, competitors, and, enemies, of, the, iroquois, confederacy, nations, in, 2010, more, than, 45, 000, enrolled, six, nations, people, lived, in, canada, and, over, 81, 000, in, the, united, states, haudenosaunee, people, of, the, longhouse, is, the, autonym, by, which, the, six, nations, refer, to, themselves, while, its, exact, etymology, is, debated, the, term, iroquois, is, of, colonial, origin, some, scholars, of, native, american, history, consider, iroquois, a, derogatory, name, adopted, from, the, traditional, enemies, of, the, haudenosaunee, a, less, common, older, autonym, for, the, confederation, is, ongweh, onweh, meaning, original, people, haudenosaunee, derives, from, two, phonetically, similar, but, etymologically, distinct, words, in, the, seneca, language, hod, n, h, ni, h, meaning, those, of, the, extended, house, and, hod, n, hs, ni, h, meaning, house, builders, the, name, haudenosaunee, first, appears, in, english, in, lewis, henry, morgan, s, work, 1851, where, he, writes, it, as, ho, d, no, sau, nee, the, spelling, hotinnonsionni, is, also, attested, from, later, in, the, nineteenth, century, an, alternative, designation, ganonsyoni, is, occasionally, encountered, as, well, from, the, mohawk, kan, hsy, ni, the, extended, house, or, from, a, cognate, expression, in, a, related, iroquoian, language, in, earlier, sources, it, is, variously, spelled, kanosoni, akwanoschioni, aquanuschioni, cannassoone, canossoone, ke, nunctioni, or, konossioni, more, transparently, the, haudenosaunee, confederacy, is, often, referred, to, as, the, six, nations, or, for, the, period, before, the, entry, of, the, tuscarora, in, 1722, the, five, nations, the, word, is, rotinonsh, n, ni, in, the, mohawk, language, the, origins, of, the, name, iroquois, are, somewhat, obscure, although, the, term, has, historically, been, more, common, among, english, texts, than, haudenosaunee, its, first, written, appearance, as, irocois, is, in, samuel, de, champlain, s, account, of, his, journey, to, tadoussac, in, 1603, other, early, french, spellings, include, erocoise, hiroquois, hyroquoise, irecoies, iriquois, iroquaes, irroquois, and, yroquois, pronounced, at, the, time, as, or, competing, theories, have, been, proposed, for, this, term, s, origin, but, none, have, gained, widespread, acceptance, by, 1978, ives, goddard, wrote, no, such, form, is, attested, in, any, indian, language, as, a, name, for, any, iroquoian, group, and, the, ultimate, origin, and, meaning, of, the, name, are, unknown, jesuit, priest, and, missionary, pierre, fran, ois, xavier, de, charlevoix, wrote, in, 1744, the, name, iroquois, is, purely, french, and, is, formed, from, the, term, hiro, or, hero, which, means, i, have, said, with, which, these, indians, close, all, their, addresses, as, the, latins, did, of, old, with, their, dixi, and, of, kou, which, is, a, cry, sometimes, of, sadness, when, it, is, prolonged, and, sometimes, of, joy, when, it, is, pronounced, shorter, in, 1883, horatio, hale, wrote, that, charlevoix, s, etymology, was, dubious, and, that, no, other, nation, or, tribe, of, which, we, have, any, knowledge, has, ever, borne, a, name, composed, in, this, whimsical, fashion, hale, suggested, instead, that, the, term, came, from, huron, and, was, cognate, with, the, mohawk, ierokwa, they, who, smoke, or, cayuga, iakwai, a, bear, in, 1888, j, n, b, hewitt, expressed, doubts, that, either, of, those, words, exist, in, the, respective, languages, he, preferred, the, etymology, from, montagnais, irin, true, real, and, ako, snake, plus, the, french, ois, suffix, later, he, revised, this, to, algonquin, iri, akhoiw, as, the, origin, a, more, modern, etymology, was, advocated, by, gordon, m, day, in, 1968, elaborating, upon, charles, arnaud, from, 1880, arnaud, had, claimed, that, the, word, came, from, montagnais, irnoku, meaning, terrible, man, via, the, reduced, form, irokue, day, proposed, a, hypothetical, montagnais, phrase, irno, kw, da, meaning, a, man, an, iroquois, as, the, origin, of, this, term, for, the, first, element, irno, day, cites, cognates, from, other, attested, montagnais, dialects, irinou, irini, and, ilnu, and, for, the, second, element, kw, da, he, suggests, a, relation, to, kouetakiou, k, etat, chi, in, and, go, tjg, names, used, by, neighboring, algonquian, tribes, to, refer, to, the, iroquois, huron, and, laurentian, peoples, the, gale, encyclopedia, of, multicultural, america, attests, the, origin, of, iroquois, to, iroqu, algonquian, for, rattlesnake, the, french, encountered, the, algonquian, speaking, tribes, first, and, would, have, learned, the, algonquian, names, for, their, iroquois, competitors, the, iroquois, confederacy, is, believed, to, have, been, founded, by, the, great, peacemaker, at, an, unknown, date, estimated, between, 1450, and, 1660, bringing, together, five, distinct, nations, in, the, southern, great, lakes, area, into, the, great, league, of, peace, other, research, however, suggests, the, founding, occurred, in, 1142, each, nation, within, this, iroquoian, confederacy, had, a, distinct, language, territory, and, function, in, the, league, the, league, is, governed, by, a, grand, council, an, assembly, of, fifty, chiefs, or, sachems, each, representing, a, clan, of, a, nation, when, europeans, first, arrived, in, north, america, the, haudenosaunee, iroquois, league, to, the, french, five, nations, to, the, british, were, based, in, what, is, now, central, and, west, new, york, state, including, the, finger, lakes, region, occupying, large, areas, north, to, the, st, lawrence, river, east, to, montreal, and, the, hudson, river, and, south, into, what, is, today, northwestern, pennsylvania, at, its, peak, around, 1700, iroquois, power, extended, from, what, is, today, new, york, state, north, into, present, day, ontario, and, quebec, along, the, lower, great, lakes, upper, st, lawrence, and, south, on, both, sides, of, the, allegheny, mountains, into, present, day, virginia, and, kentucky, and, into, the, ohio, valley, from, east, to, west, the, league, was, composed, of, the, mohawk, oneida, onondaga, cayuga, and, seneca, nations, in, about, 1722, the, iroquoian, speaking, tuscarora, joined, the, league, having, migrated, northwards, from, the, carolinas, after, a, bloody, conflict, with, white, settlers, a, shared, cultural, background, with, the, five, nations, of, the, iroquois, and, a, sponsorship, from, the, oneida, led, the, tuscarora, to, becoming, accepted, as, the, sixth, nation, in, the, confederacy, in, 1722, the, iroquois, become, known, afterwards, as, the, six, nations, other, independent, iroquoian, speaking, peoples, such, as, the, erie, susquehannock, huron, wendat, and, wyandot, lived, at, various, times, along, the, st, lawrence, river, and, around, the, great, lakes, in, the, american, southeast, the, cherokee, were, an, iroquoian, language, people, who, had, migrated, to, that, area, centuries, before, european, contact, none, of, these, were, part, of, the, haudenosaunee, league, those, on, the, borders, of, haudenosaunee, territory, in, the, great, lakes, region, competed, and, warred, with, the, nations, of, the, league, french, dutch, and, english, colonists, both, in, new, france, canada, and, what, became, the, thirteen, colonies, recognized, a, need, to, gain, favor, with, the, iroquois, people, who, occupied, a, significant, portion, of, lands, west, of, the, colonial, settlements, their, first, relations, were, for, fur, trading, which, became, highly, lucrative, for, both, sides, the, colonists, also, sought, to, establish, friendly, relations, to, secure, their, settlement, borders, for, nearly, 200, years, the, iroquois, were, a, powerful, factor, in, north, american, colonial, policy, alliance, with, the, iroquois, offered, political, and, strategic, advantages, to, the, european, powers, but, the, iroquois, preserved, considerable, independence, some, of, their, people, settled, in, mission, villages, along, the, st, lawrence, river, becoming, more, closely, tied, to, the, french, while, they, participated, in, french, led, raids, on, dutch, and, english, colonial, settlements, where, some, mohawk, and, other, iroquois, settled, in, general, the, iroquois, resisted, attacking, their, own, peoples, the, iroquois, remained, a, large, politically, united, native, american, polity, until, the, american, revolution, when, the, league, was, divided, by, their, conflicting, views, on, how, to, respond, to, requests, for, aid, from, the, british, crown, after, their, defeat, the, british, ceded, iroquois, territory, without, consultation, and, many, iroquois, had, to, abandon, their, lands, in, the, mohawk, valley, and, elsewhere, and, relocate, to, the, northern, lands, retained, by, the, british, the, crown, gave, them, land, in, compensation, for, the, five, million, acres, they, had, lost, in, the, south, but, it, was, not, equivalent, to, earlier, territory, modern, scholars, of, the, iroquois, distinguish, between, the, league, and, the, confederacy, according, to, this, interpretation, the, iroquois, league, refers, to, the, ceremonial, and, cultural, institution, embodied, in, the, grand, council, which, still, exists, the, iroquois, confederacy, was, the, decentralized, political, and, diplomatic, entity, that, emerged, in, response, to, european, colonization, which, was, dissolved, after, the, british, defeat, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, today, s, iroquois, six, nations, people, do, not, make, any, such, distinction, use, the, terms, interchangeably, but, prefer, the, name, haudenosaunee, confederacy, after, the, migration, of, a, majority, to, canada, the, iroquois, remaining, in, new, york, were, required, to, live, mostly, on, reservations, in, 1784, a, total, of, 6, 000, iroquois, faced, 240, 000, new, yorkers, with, land, hungry, new, englanders, poised, to, migrate, west, oneidas, alone, who, were, only, 600, strong, owned, six, million, acres, or, about, 2, 4, million, hectares, iroquoia, was, a, land, rush, waiting, to, happen, by, the, war, of, 1812, the, iroquois, had, lost, control, of, considerable, territory, knowledge, of, iroquois, history, stem, from, haudenosaunee, oral, tradition, archaeological, evidence, accounts, from, jesuit, missionaries, and, subsequent, european, historians, historian, scott, stevens, credits, the, early, modern, european, value, of, written, sources, over, oral, tradition, as, contributing, to, a, racialized, prejudiced, perspective, about, the, iroquois, through, the, 19th, century, the, historiography, of, the, iroquois, peoples, is, a, topic, of, much, debate, especially, regarding, the, american, colonial, period, french, jesuit, accounts, of, the, iroquois, portrayed, them, as, savages, lacking, government, law, letters, and, religion, but, the, jesuits, made, considerable, effort, to, study, their, languages, and, cultures, and, some, came, to, respect, them, a, source, of, confusion, for, european, sources, coming, from, a, patriarchal, society, was, the, matrilineal, kinship, system, of, iroquois, society, and, the, related, power, of, women, the, canadian, historian, d, peter, macleod, wrote, about, the, canadian, iroquois, and, the, french, in, the, time, of, the, seven, years, war, most, critically, the, importance, of, clan, mothers, who, possessed, considerable, economic, and, political, power, within, canadian, iroquois, communities, was, blithely, overlooked, by, patriarchal, european, scribes, those, references, that, do, exist, show, clan, mothers, meeting, in, council, with, their, male, counterparts, to, take, decisions, regarding, war, and, peace, and, joining, in, delegations, to, confront, the, onontio, and, the, french, leadership, in, montreal, but, only, hint, at, the, real, influence, wielded, by, these, women, eighteenth, century, english, historiography, focuses, on, the, diplomatic, relations, with, the, iroquois, supplemented, by, such, images, as, john, verelst, s, four, mohawk, kings, and, publications, such, as, the, anglo, iroquoian, treaty, proceedings, printed, by, benjamin, franklin, a, persistent, 19th, and, 20th, century, narrative, casts, the, iroquois, as, an, expansive, military, and, political, power, subjugated, their, enemies, by, violent, force, and, for, almost, two, centuries, acted, as, the, fulcrum, in, the, balance, of, power, in, colonial, north, america, historian, scott, stevens, noted, that, the, iroquois, themselves, began, to, influence, the, writing, of, their, history, in, the, 19th, century, including, joseph, brant, mohawk, and, david, cusick, tuscarora, c, 1780, 1840, john, arthur, gibson, seneca, 1850, 1912, was, an, important, figure, of, his, generation, in, recounting, versions, of, iroquois, history, in, epics, on, the, peacemaker, notable, women, historians, among, the, iroquois, emerged, in, the, following, decades, including, laura, minnie, kellogg, oneida, 1880, 1949, and, alice, lee, jemison, seneca, 1901, 1964, the, iroquois, league, was, established, prior, to, european, contact, with, the, banding, together, of, five, of, the, many, iroquoian, peoples, who, had, emerged, south, of, the, great, lakes, many, archaeologists, and, anthropologists, believe, that, the, league, was, formed, about, 1450, though, arguments, have, been, made, for, an, earlier, date, one, theory, argues, that, the, league, formed, shortly, after, a, solar, eclipse, on, august, 31, 1142, an, event, thought, to, be, expressed, in, oral, tradition, about, the, league, s, origins, some, sources, link, an, early, origin, of, the, iroquois, confederacy, to, the, adoption, of, corn, as, a, staple, crop, anthropologist, dean, snow, argues, that, the, archaeological, evidence, does, not, support, a, date, earlier, than, 1450, he, has, said, that, recent, claims, for, a, much, earlier, date, may, be, for, contemporary, political, purposes, other, scholars, note, that, anthropological, researchers, consulted, only, male, informants, thus, losing, the, half, of, the, historical, story, told, in, the, distinct, oral, traditions, of, women, for, this, reason, origin, tales, tend, to, emphasize, the, two, men, deganawidah, and, hiawatha, while, the, woman, jigonsaseh, who, plays, a, prominent, role, in, the, female, tradition, remains, largely, unknown, the, founders, of, league, are, traditionally, held, to, be, dekanawida, the, great, peacemaker, hiawatha, and, jigonhsasee, the, mother, of, nations, whose, home, acted, as, a, sort, of, united, nations, they, brought, the, peacemaker, s, great, law, of, peace, to, the, squabbling, iroquoian, nations, who, were, fighting, raiding, and, feuding, with, each, other, and, with, other, tribes, both, algonkian, and, iroquoian, five, nations, originally, joined, in, the, league, giving, rise, to, the, many, historic, references, to, five, nations, of, the, iroquois, with, the, addition, of, the, southern, tuscarora, in, the, 18th, century, these, original, five, tribes, still, compose, the, haudenosaunee, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, mohawk, onondaga, oneida, cayuga, and, seneca, according, to, legend, an, evil, onondaga, chieftain, named, tadodaho, was, the, last, converted, to, the, ways, of, peace, by, the, great, peacemaker, and, hiawatha, he, was, offered, the, position, as, the, titular, chair, of, the, league, s, council, representing, the, unity, of, all, nations, of, the, league, this, is, said, to, have, occurred, at, onondaga, lake, near, present, day, syracuse, new, york, the, title, tadodaho, is, still, used, for, the, league, s, chair, the, fiftieth, chief, who, sits, with, the, onondaga, in, council, the, iroquois, subsequently, created, a, highly, egalitarian, society, one, british, colonial, administrator, declared, in, 1749, that, the, iroquois, had, such, absolute, notions, of, liberty, that, they, allow, no, kind, of, superiority, of, one, over, another, and, banish, all, servitude, from, their, territories, as, raids, between, the, member, tribes, ended, and, they, directed, warfare, against, competitors, the, iroquois, increased, in, numbers, while, their, rivals, declined, the, political, cohesion, of, the, iroquois, rapidly, became, one, of, the, strongest, forces, in, 17th, and, 18th, century, northeastern, north, america, the, league, s, council, of, fifty, ruled, on, disputes, and, sought, consensus, however, the, confederacy, did, not, speak, for, all, five, tribes, which, continued, to, act, independently, and, form, their, own, war, bands, around, 1678, the, council, began, to, exert, more, power, in, negotiations, with, the, colonial, governments, of, pennsylvania, and, new, york, and, the, iroquois, became, very, adroit, at, diplomacy, playing, off, the, french, against, the, british, as, individual, tribes, had, earlier, played, the, swedes, dutch, and, english, iroquoian, language, peoples, were, involved, in, warfare, and, trading, with, nearby, members, of, the, iroquois, league, the, explorer, robert, la, salle, in, the, 17th, century, identified, the, mosopelea, as, among, the, ohio, valley, peoples, defeated, by, the, iroquois, in, the, early, 1670s, the, erie, and, peoples, of, the, upper, allegheny, valley, declined, earlier, during, the, beaver, wars, by, 1676, the, power, of, the, susquehannock, was, broken, from, the, effects, of, three, years, of, epidemic, disease, war, with, the, iroquois, and, frontier, battles, as, settlers, took, advantage, of, the, weakened, tribe, according, to, one, theory, of, early, iroquois, history, after, becoming, united, in, the, league, the, iroquois, invaded, the, ohio, river, valley, in, the, territories, that, would, become, the, eastern, ohio, country, down, as, far, as, present, day, kentucky, to, seek, additional, hunting, grounds, they, displaced, about, 1, 200, siouan, speaking, tribepeople, of, the, ohio, river, valley, such, as, the, quapaw, akansea, ofo, mosopelea, and, tutelo, and, other, closely, related, tribes, out, of, the, region, these, tribes, migrated, to, regions, around, the, mississippi, river, and, the, piedmont, regions, of, the, east, coast, other, iroquoian, language, peoples, including, the, populous, wyandot, huron, with, related, social, organization, and, cultures, became, extinct, as, tribes, as, a, result, of, disease, and, war, they, did, not, join, the, league, when, invited, and, were, much, reduced, after, the, beaver, wars, and, high, mortality, from, eurasian, infectious, diseases, while, the, indigenous, nations, sometimes, tried, to, remain, neutral, in, the, various, colonial, frontier, wars, some, also, allied, with, europeans, as, in, the, french, and, indian, war, the, north, american, front, of, the, seven, years, war, the, six, nations, were, split, in, their, alliances, between, the, french, and, british, in, that, war, in, reflections, in, bullough, s, pond, historian, diana, muir, argues, that, the, pre, contact, iroquois, were, an, imperialist, expansionist, culture, whose, cultivation, of, the, corn, beans, squash, agricultural, complex, enabled, them, to, support, a, large, population, they, made, war, primarily, against, neighboring, algonquian, peoples, muir, uses, archaeological, data, to, argue, that, the, iroquois, expansion, onto, algonquian, lands, was, checked, by, the, algonquian, adoption, of, agriculture, this, enabled, them, to, support, their, own, populations, large, enough, to, resist, iroquois, conquest, the, people, of, the, confederacy, dispute, this, historical, interpretation, regarding, the, league, of, the, great, peace, as, the, foundation, of, their, heritage, the, iroquois, may, be, the, kwedech, described, in, the, oral, legends, of, the, mi, kmaq, nation, of, eastern, canada, these, legends, relate, that, the, mi, kmaq, in, the, late, pre, contact, period, had, gradually, driven, their, enemies, the, kwedech, westward, across, new, brunswick, and, finally, out, of, the, lower, st, lawrence, river, region, the, mi, kmaq, named, the, last, conquered, land, gespedeg, or, last, land, from, which, the, french, derived, gasp, the, kwedech, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, iroquois, specifically, the, mohawk, their, expulsion, from, gasp, by, the, mi, kmaq, has, been, estimated, as, occurring, c, 1535, 1600, around, 1535, jacques, cartier, reported, iroquoian, speaking, groups, on, the, gasp, peninsula, and, along, the, st, lawrence, river, archeologists, and, anthropologists, have, defined, the, st, lawrence, iroquoians, as, a, distinct, and, separate, group, and, possibly, several, discrete, groups, living, in, the, villages, of, hochelaga, and, others, nearby, near, present, day, montreal, which, had, been, visited, by, cartier, by, 1608, when, samuel, de, champlain, visited, the, area, that, part, of, the, st, lawrence, river, valley, had, no, settlements, but, was, controlled, by, the, mohawk, as, a, hunting, ground, the, fate, of, the, iroquoian, people, that, cartier, encountered, remains, a, mystery, and, all, that, can, be, stated, for, certain, is, when, champlain, arrived, they, were, gone, on, the, gasp, peninsula, champlain, encountered, algonquian, speaking, groups, the, precise, identity, of, any, of, these, groups, is, still, debated, on, july, 29, 1609, champlain, assisted, his, allies, in, defeating, a, mohawk, war, party, by, the, shores, of, what, is, now, called, lake, champlain, and, again, in, june, 1610, champlain, fought, against, the, mohawks, the, iroquois, became, well, known, in, the, southern, colonies, in, the, 17th, century, by, this, time, after, the, first, english, settlement, in, jamestown, virginia, 1607, numerous, 17th, century, accounts, describe, a, powerful, people, known, to, the, powhatan, confederacy, as, the, massawomeck, and, to, the, french, as, the, antouhonoron, they, were, said, to, come, from, the, north, beyond, the, susquehannock, territory, historians, have, often, identified, the, massawomeck, antouhonoron, as, the, haudenosaunee, in,

their, own, success, the, five, nations, of, the, league, established, a, trading, relationship, with, the, dutch, at, fort, orange, modern, albany, new, york, trading, furs, for, european, goods, an, economic, relationship, that, profoundly, changed, their, way, of, life, and, led, to, much, over, hunting, of, beavers, between, 1665, and, 1670, the, iroquois, established, seven, villages, on, the, northern, shores, of, lake, ontario, in, present, day, ontario, collectively, known, as, the, iroquois, du, nord, villages, the, villages, were, all, abandoned, by, 1701, over, the, years, 1670, 1710,

as, a, result, of, the, beaver, wars, they, pushed, siouan, speaking, tribes, out, and, reserved, the, territory, as, a, hunting, ground, by, right, of, conquest, they, finally, sold, to, british, colonists, their, remaining, claim, to, the, lands, south, of, the, ohio, in, 1768, at, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, historian, pekka, h, m, l, inen, writes, of, the, league, there, had, never,

in, 1609, the, league, engaged, in, the, decades, long, beaver, wars, against, the, french, their, huron, allies, and, other, neighboring, tribes, including, the, petun, erie, and, susquehannock,

canadian, shield, region, and, not, infrequently, the, english, colonies, as, well, during, the, beaver, wars, they, were, said, to, have, defeated, and, assimilated, the, huron, 1649, petun, 1650, the, neutral, nation, 1651, erie, tribe, 1657, and, susquehannock, 1680, the, traditional, view, is, that, these, wars, were, a, way, to, control, the, lucrative, fur, trade, to, purchase, european, goods, on, which, they, had, become, dependent, starna, questions, this, view, recent, scholarship, has, elaborated, on, this, view, arguing, that, the, beaver, wars, were, an, escalation, of, the, iroquoian, tradition, of, mourning, wars, this, view, suggests, that, the, iroquois, launched, large, scale, attacks, against, neighboring, tribes, to, avenge, or, replace, the, many, dead, from, battles, and, smallpox, epidemics, in, 1628, the, mohawk, defeated, the, mahican, to, gain, a, monopoly, in, the, fur, trade, with, the, dutch, at, fort, orange, present, day, albany, new, netherland,

these, attacks, primarily, against, the, huron, towns, of, taenhatentaron, st, ignace, and, st, louis, in, what, is, now, simcoe, county, ontario, were, the, final, battles, that, effectively,

frontenac, for, support, it, would, be, a, shame, for, him, to, allow, his, children, to, be, crushed, as, they, saw, themselves, to, be, they, not, having, the, means, of, going, to, attack, their, fort, which, was, very, strong, nor, even, of, defending, themselves, if, the, others, came, to, attack, them, in, their, villages, some, old, histories, state, that, the, iroquois, defeated, the,

1676, destroying, villages, and, food, stores, while, taking, many, prisoners, by, 1677, the, iroquois, formed, an, alliance, with, the, english, through, an, agreement, known, as, the, covenant, chain, by, 1680, the, iroquois, confederacy, was, in, a, strong, position, having, eliminated, the, susquehannock, and, the, wampanoag, taken, vast, numbers, of, captives, to, augment, their,

allies, peace, was, not, reached, until, 1685, during, the, same, period, french, jesuit, missionaries, were, active, in, iroquoia, which, led, to, a, voluntary, mass, relocation, of, many, haudenosaunee, to, the, st, lawrence, valley, at, kahnawake, and, kanesatake, near, montreal, it, was, the, intention, of, the, french, to, use, the, catholic, haudenosaunee, in, the, st, lawrence, valley, as, a, buffer, to, keep, the, english, allied, haudenosaunee, tribes, in, what, is, now, upstate, new, york, away, from, the, center, of, the, french, fur, trade, in, montreal, the, attempts, of, both, the, english, and, the, french, to, make, use, of, their, haudenosaunee, allies, were, foiled, as, the, two, groups, of, haudenosaunee, showed, a, profound, reluctance, to, kill, one, another, following, the, move, of, the, catholic, iroquois, to, the, st, lawrence, valley, historians, commonly, describe, the, iroquois, living, outside, of, montreal, as, the, canadian, iroquois, while, those, remaining, in, their, historical, heartland, in, modern, upstate, new, york, are, described, as, the, league, iroquois, in, 1684, the, governor, general, of, new, france, joseph, antoine, le, febvre, de, la, barre, decided, to, launch, a, punitive, expedition, against, the, seneca, who, were, attacking, french, and, algonquian, fur, traders, in, the, mississippi, river, valley, and, asked, for, the, catholic, haudenosaunee, to, contribute, fighting, men, la, barre, s, expedition, ended, in, fiasco, in, september, 1684, when, influenza, broke, out, among, the, french, troupes, de, la, marine, while, the, canadian, iroquois, warriors, refused, to, fight, instead, only, engaging, in, battles, of, insults, with, the, seneca, warriors, king, louis, xiv, of, france, was, not, amused, when, he, heard, of, la, barre, s, failure, which, led, to, his, replacement, with, jacques, ren, de, brisay, marquis, de, denonville, governor, general, 1685, 1689, who, arrived, in, august, with, orders, from, the, sun, king, to, crush, the, haudenosaunee, confederacy, and, uphold, the, honor, of, france, even, in, the, wilds, of, north, america, in, the, same, year, the, iroquois, again, invaded, virginia, and, illinois, territory, and, unsuccessfully, attacked, french, outposts, in, the, latter, trying, to, reduce, warfare, in, the, shenandoah, valley, of, virginia, later, that, year, the, virginia, colony, agreed, in, a, conference, at, albany, to, recognize, the, iroquois, right, to, use, the, north, south, path, known, as, the, great, warpath, running, east, of, the, blue, ridge, provided, they, did, not, intrude, on, the, english, settlements, east, of, the, fall, line, in, 1687, the, marquis, de, denonville, set, out, for, fort, frontenac, modern,

marseilles, france, to, be, used, as, galley, slaves, several, of, the, catholic, haudenosaunee, were, outraged, at, this, treachery, to, a, diplomatic, party, which, led, to, at, least, 100, of, them, to, desert, to, the, seneca, denonville, justified, enslaving, the, people, he, encountered, saying, that, as, a, civilized, european, he, did, not, respect, the, customs, of, savages, and, would, do, as, he, liked, with, them, on, august, 13, 1687, an, advance, party, of, french, soldiers, walked, into, a, seneca, ambush, and, were, nearly, killed, to, a, man, however, the, seneca,

farther, west, east, and, south, down, the, susquehanna, river, although, great, damage, was, done, to, their, homeland, the, senecas, military, might, was, not, appreciably, weakened, the, confederacy, and, the, seneca, developed, an, alliance, with, the, english, who, were, settling, in, the, east, the, destruction, of, the, seneca, land, infuriated, the, members, of, the, iroquois,

the, mohawk, who, had, been, the, favorite, enemies, of, the, french, on, july, 6, he, left, lachine, at, the, head, of, a, considerable, force, and, traveled, to, the, capital, of, onondaga, where, he, arrived, a, month, later, with, support, from, the, french, the, algonquian, nations, drove, the, iroquois, out, of, the, territories, north, of, lake, erie, and, west, of, present, day,

repulsed, with, heavy, losses, though, the, battle, of, lake, george, was, a, british, victory, the, heavy, losses, taken, by, the, mohawk, and, oneida, at, the, battle, caused, the, league, to, declare, neutrality, in, the, war, despite, johnson, s, best, efforts, the, league, iroquois, remained, neutral, for, next, several, years, and, a, series, of, french, victories, at, oswego, louisbourg, fort, william, henry, and, fort, carillon, ensured, the, league, iroquois, would, not, fight, on, what, appeared, to, be, the, losing, side, in, february, 1756, the, french, learned, from, a, spy, oratory, an, oneida, chief, that, the, british, were, stockpiling, supplies, at, the, oneida, carrying, place, a, crucial, portage, between, albany, and, oswego, to, support, an, offensive, in, the, spring, into, what, is, now, ontario, as, the, frozen, waters, melted, south, of, lake, ontario, on, average, two, weeks, before, the, waters, did, north, of, lake, ontario, the, british, would, be, able, to, move, against, the, french, bases, at, fort, frontenac, and, fort, niagara, before, the, french, forces, in, montreal, could, come, to, their, relief, which, from, the, french, perspective, necessitated, a, preemptive, strike, at, the, oneida, carrying, place, in, the, winter, to, carry, out, this, strike, the, marquis, de, vaudreuil, the, governor, general, of, new, france, assigned, the, task, to, gaspard, joseph, chaussegros, de, l, ry, an, officer, of, the, troupes, de, le, marine, who, required, and, received, the, assistance, of, the, canadian, iroquois, to, guide, him, to, the, oneida, carrying, place, the, canadian, iroquois, joined, the, expedition, which, left, montreal, on, february, 29, 1756, on, the, understanding, that, they, would, only, fight, against, the, british, not, the, league, iroquois, and, they, would, not, be, assaulting, a, fort, on, march, 13, 1756, an, oswegatchie, indian, traveler, informed, the, expedition, that, the, british, had, built, two, forts, at, the, oneida, carrying, place, which, caused, the, majority, of, the, canadian, iroquois, to, want, to, turn, back, as, they, argued, the, risks, of, assaulting, a, fort, would, mean, too, many, casualties, and, many, did, in, fact, abandon, the, expedition, on, march, 26, 1756, l, ry, s, force, of, troupes, de, le, marine, and, french, canadian, militiamen, who, had, not, eaten, for, two, days, received, much, needed, food, when, the, canadian, iroquois, ambushed, a, british, wagon, train, bringing, supplies, to, fort, william, and, fort, bull, as, far, as, the, canadian, iroquois, were, concerned, the, raid, was, a, success, as, they, captured, 9, wagons, full, of, supplies, and, took, 10, prisoners, without, losing, a, man, and, for, them, engaging, in, a, frontal, attack, against, the, two, wooden, forts, as, l, ry, wanted, to, do, was, irrational, the, canadian, iroquois, informed, l, ry, if, i, absolutely, wanted, to, die, i, was, the, master, of, the, french, but, they, were, not, going, to, follow, me, in, the, end, about, 30, canadian, iroquois, reluctantly, joined, l, ry, s, attack, on, fort, bull, on, the, morning, of, march, 27, 1756, when, the, french, and, their, indian, allies, stormed, the, fort, finally, smashing, their, way, in, through, the, main, gate, with, a, battering, ram, at, noon, of, the, 63, people, in, fort, bull, half, of, whom, were, civilians, only, 3, soldiers, one, carpenter, and, one, woman, survived, the, battle, of, fort, bull, as, l, ry, reported, i, could, not, restrain, the, ardor, of, the, soldiers, and, the, canadians, they, killed, everyone, they, encountered, afterwards, the, french, destroyed, all, of, the, british, supplies, and, fort, bull, itself, which, secured, the, western, flank, of, new, france, on, the, same, day, the, main, force, of, the, canadian, iroquois, ambushed, a, relief, force, from, fort, william, coming, to, the, aid, of, fort, bull, and, did, not, slaughter, their, prisoners, as, the, french, did, at, fort, bull, for, the, iroquois, prisoners, were, very, valuable, as, they, increased, the, size, of, the, tribe, the, crucial, difference, between, the, european, and, first, nations, way, of, war, was, that, europe, had, millions, of, people, which, meant, that, british, and, french, generals, were, willing, to, see, thousands, of, their, own, men, die, in, battle, in, order, to, secure, victory, as, their, losses, could, always, be, made, good, by, contrast, the, iroquois, had, a, considerably, smaller, population, and, could, not, afford, heavy, losses, which, could, cripple, a, community, the, iroquois, custom, of, mourning, wars, to, take, captives, who, would, become, iroquois, reflected, the, continual, need, for, more, people, in, the, iroquois, communities, iroquois, warriors, were, brave, but, would, only, fight, to, the, death, if, necessary, usually, to, protect, their, women, and, children, otherwise, the, crucial, concern, for, iroquois, chiefs, was, always, to, save, manpower, the, canadian, historian, d, peter, macleod, wrote, that, the, iroquois, way, of, war, was, based, on, their, hunting, philosophy, where, a, successful, hunter, would, bring, down, an, animal, efficiently, without, taking, any, losses, to, his, hunting, party, and, in, the, same, way, a, successful, war, leader, would, inflict, losses, on, the, enemy, without, taking, any, losses, in, return, the, iroquois, only, entered, the, war, on, the, british, side, again, in, late, 1758, after, the, british, took, louisbourg, and, fort, frontenac, at, the, treaty, of, fort, easton, in, october, 1758, the, iroquois, forced, the, lenape, and, shawnee, who, had, been, fighting, for, the, french, to, declare, neutrality, in, july, 1759, the, iroquois, helped, johnson, take, fort, niagara, in, the, ensuing, campaign, the, league, iroquois, assisted, general, jeffrey, amherst, as, he, took, various, french, forts, by, the, great, lakes, and, the, st, lawrence, valley, as, he, advanced, towards, montreal, which, he, took, in, september, 1760, the, british, historian, michael, johnson, wrote, the, iroquois, had, played, a, major, supporting, role, in, the, final, british, victory, in, the, seven, years, war, in, 1763, johnson, left, his, old, home, of, fort, johnson, for, the, lavish, estate, which, he, called, johnson, hall, which, become, a, center, of, social, life, in, the, region, johnson, was, close, to, two, white, families, the, butlers, and, the, croghans, and, three, mohawk, families, the, brants, the, hills, and, the, peters, after, the, war, to, protect, their, alliance, the, british, government, issued, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, forbidding, white, settlement, beyond, the, appalachian, mountains, american, colonists, largely, ignored, the, order, and, the, british, had, insufficient, soldiers, to, enforce, it, faced, with, confrontations, the, iroquois, agreed, to, adjust, the, line, again, in, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, 1768, sir, william, johnson, 1st, baronet, british, superintendent, of, indian, affairs, for, the, northern, district, had, called, the, iroquois, nations, together, in, a, grand, conference, in, western, new, york, which, a, total, of, 3, 102, indians, attended, they, had, long, had, good, relations, with, johnson, who, had, traded, with, them, and, learned, their, languages, and, customs, as, alan, taylor, noted, in, his, history, the, divided, ground, indians, settlers, and, the, northern, borderland, of, the, american, revolution, 2006, the, iroquois, were, creative, and, strategic, thinkers, they, chose, to, sell, to, the, british, crown, all, their, remaining, claim, to, the, lands, between, the, ohio, and, tennessee, rivers, which, they, did, not, occupy, hoping, by, doing, so, to, draw, off, english, pressure, on, their, territories, in, the, province, of, new, york, during, the, american, revolution, the, iroquois, first, tried, to, stay, neutral, the, reverend, samuel, kirkland, a, congregational, minister, working, as, a, missionary, pressured, the, oneida, and, the, tuscarora, for, a, pro, american, neutrality, while, guy, johnson, and, his, cousin, john, johnson, pressured, the, mohawk, the, cayuga, and, the, seneca, to, fight, for, the, british, pressed, to, join, one, side, or, the, other, the, tuscarora, and, the, oneida, sided, with, the, colonists, while, the, mohawk, seneca, onondaga, and, cayuga, remained, loyal, to, great, britain, with, whom, they, had, stronger, relationships, joseph, louis, cook, offered, his, services, to, the, united, states, and, received, a, congressional, commission, as, a, lieutenant, colonel, the, highest, rank, held, by, any, native, american, during, the, war, the, mohawk, war, chief, joseph, brant, together, with, john, butler, and, john, johnson, raised, racially, mixed, forces, of, irregulars, to, fight, for, the, crown, molly, brant, had, been, the, common, law, wife, of, sir, william, johnson, and, it, was, through, her, patronage, that, her, brother, joseph, came, to, be, a, war, chief, the, mohawk, war, chief, joseph, brant, other, war, chiefs, and, british, allies, conducted, numerous, operations, against, frontier, settlements, in, the, mohawk, valley, including, the, cherry, valley, massacre, destroying, many, villages, and, crops, and, killing, and, capturing, inhabitants, the, destructive, raids, by, brant, and, other, loyalists, led, to, appeals, to, congress, for, help, the, continentals, retaliated, and, in, 1779, george, washington, ordered, the, sullivan, campaign, led, by, col, daniel, brodhead, and, general, john, sullivan, against, the, iroquois, nations, to, not, merely, overrun, but, destroy, the, british, indian, alliance, they, burned, many, iroquois, villages, and, stores, throughout, western, new, york, refugees, moved, north, to, canada, by, the, end, of, the, war, few, houses, and, barns, in, the, valley, had, survived, the, warfare, in, the, aftermath, of, the, sullivan, expedition, brant, visited, quebec, city, to, ask, general, sir, frederick, haildmand, for, assurances, that, the, mohawk, and, the, other, loyalist, iroquois, would, receive, a, new, homeland, in, canada, as, compensation, for, their, loyalty, to, the, crown, if, the, british, should, lose, the, american, revolution, caused, a, great, divide, between, the, colonists, between, patriots, and, loyalists, and, a, large, proportion, 30, 35, who, were, neutral, it, caused, a, divide, between, the, colonies, and, great, britain, and, it, also, caused, a, rift, that, would, break, the, iroquois, confederacy, at, the, onset, of, the, revolution, the, iroquois, confederacy, s, six, nations, attempted, to, take, a, stance, of, neutrality, however, almost, inevitably, the, iroquois, nations, eventually, had, to, take, sides, in, the, conflict, it, is, easy, to, see, how, the, american, revolution, would, have, caused, conflict, and, confusion, among, the, six, nations, for, years, they, had, been, used, to, thinking, about, the, english, and, their, colonists, as, one, and, the, same, people, in, the, american, revolution, the, iroquois, confederacy, now, had, to, deal, with, relationships, between, two, governments, the, iroquois, confederation, s, population, had, changed, significantly, since, the, arrival, of, europeans, disease, had, reduced, their, population, to, a, fraction, of, what, it, had, been, in, the, past, therefore, it, was, in, their, best, interest, to, be, on, the, good, side, of, whoever, would, prove, to, be, the, winning, side, in, the, war, for, the, winning, side, would, dictate, how, future, relationships, would, be, with, the, iroquois, in, north, america, dealing, with, two, governments, made, it, hard, to, maintain, a, neutral, stance, because, the, governments, could, get, jealous, easily, if, the, confederacy, was, interacting, or, trading, more, with, one, side, over, the, other, or, even, if, there, was, simply, a, perception, of, favoritism, because, of, this, challenging, situation, the, six, nations, had, to, choose, sides, the, oneida, and, tuscarora, decided, to, support, the, american, colonists, while, the, rest, of, the, iroquois, league, the, cayuga, mohawk, onondaga, and, seneca, sided, with, the, british, and, their, loyalists, among, the, colonists, there, were, many, reasons, that, the, six, nations, could, not, remain, neutral, and, uninvolved, in, the, revolutionary, war, one, of, these, is, simple, proximity, the, iroquois, confederacy, was, too, close, to, the, action, of, the, war, to, not, be, involved, the, six, nations, were, very, discontented, with, the, encroachment, of, the, english, and, their, colonists, upon, their, land, they, were, particularly, concerned, with, the, border, established, in, the, proclamation, of, 1763, and, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, in, 1768, during, the, american, revolution, the, authority, of, the, british, government, over, the, frontier, was, hotly, contested, the, colonists, tried, to, take, advantage, of, this, as, much, as, possible, by, seeking, their, own, profit, and, claiming, new, land, in, 1775, the, six, nations, were, still, neutral, when, a, mohawk, person, was, killed, by, a, continental, soldier, such, a, case, shows, how, the, six, nations, proximity, to, the, war, drew, them, into, it, they, were, concerned, about, being, killed, and, about, their, lands, being, taken, from, them, they, could, not, show, weakness, and, simply, let, the, colonists, and, british, do, whatever, they, wanted, many, of, the, english, and, colonists, did, not, respect, the, treaties, made, in, the, past, a, number, of, his, majesty, s, subjects, in, the, american, colonies, viewed, the, proclamation, as, a, temporary, prohibition, which, would, soon, give, way, to, the, opening, of, the, area, for, settlement, and, that, it, was, simply, an, agreement, to, quiet, the, minds, of, the, indians, the, six, nations, had, to, take, a, stand, to, show, that, they, would, not, accept, such, treatment, and, they, looked, to, build, a, relationship, with, a, government, that, would, respect, their, territory, in, addition, to, being, in, close, proximity, to, the, war, the, new, lifestyle, and, economics, of, the, iroquois, confederacy, since, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, in, north, america, made, it, nearly, impossible, for, the, iroquois, to, isolate, themselves, from, the, conflict, by, this, time, the, iroquois, had, become, dependent, upon, the, trade, of, goods, from, the, english, and, colonists, and, had, adopted, many, european, customs, tools, and, weapons, for, example, they, were, increasingly, dependent, on, firearms, for, hunting, after, becoming, so, reliant, it, would, have, been, hard, to, even, consider, cutting, off, trade, that, brought, goods, that, were, a, central, part, of, everyday, life, as, barbara, graymont, stated, their, task, was, an, impossible, one, to, maintain, neutrality, their, economies, and, lives, had, become, so, dependent, on, each, other, for, trading, goods, and, benefits, it, was, impossible, to, ignore, the, conflict, meanwhile, they, had, to, try, and, balance, their, interactions, with, both, groups, they, did, not, want, to, seem, as, they, were, favoring, one, group, over, the, other, because, of, sparking, jealousy, and, suspicion, from, either, side, furthermore, the, english, had, made, many, agreements, with, the, six, nations, over, the, years, yet, most, of, the, iroquois, day, to, day, interaction, had, been, with, the, colonists, this, made, it, a, confusing, situation, for, the, iroquois, because, they, could, not, tell, who, the, true, heirs, of, the, agreement, were, and, could, not, know, if, agreements, with, england, would, continue, to, be, honored, by, the, colonists, if, they, were, to, win, independence, supporting, either, side, in, the, revolutionary, war, was, a, complicated, decision, each, nation, individually, weighed, their, options, to, come, up, with, a, final, stance, that, ultimately, broke, neutrality, and, ended, the, collective, agreement, of, the, confederation, the, british, were, clearly, the, most, organized, and, seemingly, most, powerful, in, many, cases, the, british, presented, the, situation, to, the, iroquois, as, the, colonists, just, being, naughty, children, on, the, other, the, iroquois, considered, that, the, british, government, was, three, thousand, miles, away, this, placed, them, at, a, disadvantage, in, attempting, to, enforce, both, the, proclamation, of, 1763, and, the, treaty, at, fort, stanwix, 1768, against, land, hungry, frontiersmen, in, other, words, even, though, the, british, were, the, strongest, and, best, organized, faction, the, six, nations, had, concerns, about, whether, they, would, truly, be, able, to, enforce, their, agreements, from, so, far, away, the, iroquois, also, had, concerns, about, the, colonists, the, british, asked, for, iroquois, support, in, the, war, in, 1775, the, continental, congress, sent, a, delegation, to, the, iroquois, in, albany, to, ask, for, their, neutrality, in, the, war, coming, against, the, british, it, had, been, clear, in, prior, years, that, the, colonists, had, not, been, respectful, of, the, land, agreements, made, in, 1763, and, 1768, the, iroquois, confederacy, was, particularly, concerned, over, the, possibility, of, the, colonists, winning, the, war, for, if, a, revolutionary, victory, were, to, occur, the, iroquois, very, much, saw, it, as, the, precursor, to, their, lands, being, taken, away, by, the, victorious, colonists, who, would, no, longer, have, the, british, crown, to, restrain, them, continental, army, officers, such, as, george, washington, had, attempted, to, destroy, the, iroquois, on, a, contrasting, note, it, was, the, colonists, who, had, formed, the, most, direct, relationships, with, the, iroquois, due, to, their, proximity, and, trade, ties, for, the, most, part, the, colonists, and, iroquois, had, lived, in, relative, peace, since, the, english, arrival, on, the, continent, a, century, and, a, half, before, the, iroquois, had, to, determine, whether, their, relationships, with, the, colonists, were, reliable, or, whether, the, english, would, prove, to, better, serve, their, interests, they, also, had, to, determine, whether, there, were, really, any, differences, between, how, the, english, and, the, colonists, would, treat, them, the, war, ensued, and, the, iroquois, broke, their, confederation, hundreds, of, years, of, precedent, and, collective, government, was, trumped, by, the, immensity, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, oneida, and, tuscarora, decided, to, support, the, colonists, while, the, rest, of, the, iroquois, league, the, cayuga, mohawk, onondaga, and, seneca, sided, with, the, british, and, loyalists, at, the, conclusion, of, the, war, the, fear, that, the, colonists, would, not, respect, the, iroquois, pleas, came, true, especially, after, the, majority, of, the, six, nations, decided, to, side, with, the, british, and, were, no, longer, considered, trustworthy, by, the, newly, independent, americans, in, 1783, the, treaty, of, paris, was, signed, while, the, treaty, included, peace, agreements, between, all, of, the, european, nations, involved, in, the, war, as, well, as, the, newborn, united, states, it, made, no, provisions, for, the, iroquois, who, were, left, to, be, treated, with, by, the, new, u, s, government, as, it, saw, fit, after, the, revolutionary, war, the, ancient, central, fireplace, of, the, league, was, re, established, at, buffalo, creek, the, u, s, and, the, iroquois, signed, the, treaty, of, fort, stanwix, in, 1784, under, which, the, iroquois, ceded, much, of, their, historical, homeland, to, the, americans, which, was, followed, by, another, treaty, in, 1794, at, canandaigua, which, they, ceded, even, more, land, to, the, americans, the, governor, of, new, york, state, george, clinton, was, constantly, pressuring, the, iroquois, to, sell, their, land, to, white, settlers, and, as, alcoholism, became, a, major, problem, in, the, iroquois, communities, many, did, sell, their, land, in, order, to, buy, more, alcohol, usually, to, unscrupulous, agents, of, land, companies, at, the, same, time, american, settlers, continued, to, push, into, the, lands, beyond, the, ohio, river, leading, to, a, war, between, the, western, confederacy, and, the, u, s, one, of, the, iroquois, chiefs, cornplanter, persuaded, the, remaining, iroquois, in, new, york, state, to, remain, neutral, and, not, to, join, the, western, confederacy, at, the, same, time, american, policies, to, make, the, iroquois, more, settled, started, to, have, some, effect, traditionally, for, the, iroquois, farming, was, woman, s, work, and, hunting, was, men, s, work, by, the, early, 19th, century, american, policies, to, have, the, men, farm, the, land, and, cease, hunting, were, having, effect, during, this, time, the, iroquois, living, in, new, york, state, become, demoralized, as, more, of, their, land, was, sold, to, land, speculators, while, alcoholism, violence, and, broken, families, became, major, problems, on, their, reservations, the, oneida, and, the, cayuga, sold, almost, all, of, their, land, and, moved, out, of, their, traditional, homelands, by, 1811, methodist, and, episcopalian, missionaries, established, missions, to, assist, the, oneida, and, onondaga, in, western, new, york, however, white, settlers, continued, to, move, into, the, area, by, 1821, a, group, of, oneida, led, by, eleazer, williams, son, of, a, mohawk, woman, went, to, wisconsin, to, buy, land, from, the, menominee, and, ho, chunk, and, thus, move, their, people, further, westward, in, 1838, the, holland, land, company, used, forged, documents, to, cheat, the, seneca, of, almost, all, of, their, land, in, western, new, york, but, a, quaker, missionary, asher, wright, launched, lawsuits, that, led, to, one, of, the, seneca, reservations, being, returned, in, 1842, and, another, in, 1857, however, as, late, as, the, 1950s, both, the, u, s, and, new, york, governments, confiscated, land, belonging, to, the, six, nations, for, roads, dams, and, reservoirs, with, the, land, being, given, to, cornplanter, for, keeping, the, iroquois, from, joining, the, western, confederacy, in, the, 1790s, being, forcibly, purchased, by, eminent, domain, and, flooded, for, the, kinzua, dam, captain, joseph, brant, and, a, group, of, iroquois, left, new, york, to, settle, in, the, province, of, quebec, present, day, ontario, to, partially, replace, the, lands, they, had, lost, in, the, mohawk, valley, and, elsewhere, because, of, their, fateful, alliance, with, the, british, crown, the, haldimand, proclamation, gave, them, a, large, land, grant, on, the, grand, river, at, six, nations, of, the, grand, river, first, nation, brant, s, crossing, of, the, river,

in, the, north, american, fur, trade, as, far, west, as, the, rocky, mountains, they, are, known, to, have, settled, in, the, area, around, jasper, s, house, and, possibly, as, far, west, as, the,

in, the, war, of, 1812, the, canadian, iroquois, again, declared, their, neutrality, the, canadian, iroquois, communities, at, oka, and, kahnaweke, were, prosperous, settlements, in, the, 19th, century, supporting, themselves, via, farming, and, the, sale, of, sleds, snowshoes, boats, and, baskets, in, 1884, about, 100, canadian, iroquois, were, hired, by, the, british, government, to,

by, queen, victoria, for, their, services, to, queen, and, country, in, 1886, when, a, bridge, was, being, built, at, the, st, lawrence, a, number, of, iroquois, men, from, kahnawke, were, hired, to, help, built, and, the, iroquois, workers, proved, so, skilled, as, steelwork, erectors, that, since, that, time, a, number, of, bridges, and, skyscrapers, in, canada, and, the, u, s, have, been, built, by, the, iroquois, steelmen, during, world, war, i, it, was, canadian, policy, to, encourage, men, from, the, first, nations, to, enlist, in, the, canadian, expeditionary, force, cef, where, their, skills, at, hunting, made, them, excellent, as, snipers, and, scouts, as, the, iroquois, six, nations, were, considered, the, most, warlike, of, canada, s, first, nations, and, in, turn, the, mohawk, the, most, warlike, of, the, six, nations, the, canadian, government, especially, encouraged, the, iroquois, particularly, the, mohawks, to, join, about, half, of, the, 4, 000, or, so, first, nations, men, who, served, in, the, cef, were, iroquois, men, from, the, six, nations, reservation, at, brantford, were, encouraged, to, join, the, 114th, haldimand, battalion, also, known, as, brock, s, rangers, of, the, cef, where, two, entire, companies, including, the, officers, were, all, iroquois, the, 114th, battalion, was, formed, in, december, 1915, and, broken, up, in, november, 1916, to, provide, reinforcements, for, other, battalions, a, mohawk, from, brantford, william, forster, lickers, who, enlisted, in, the, cef, in, september, 1914, was, captured, at, the, second, battle, of, ypres, in, april, 1915, where, he, was, savagely, beaten, by, his, captors, as, one, german, officer, wanted, to, see, if, indians, could, feel, pain, lickers, was, beaten, so, badly, that, he, was, left, paralyzed, for, the, rest, of, his, life, though, the, officer, was, well, pleased, to, establish, that, indians, did, indeed, feel, pain, the, six, nations, council, at, brantford, tended, to, see, themselves, as, a, sovereign, nation, that, was, allied, to, the, crown, through, the, covenant, chain, going, back, to, the, 17th, century, and, thus, allied, to, king, george, v, personally, instead, of, being, under, the, authority, of, canada, one, iroquois, clan, mother, in, a, letter, sent, in, august, 1916, to, a, recruiting, sergeant, who, refused, to, allow, her, teenage, son, to, join, the, cef, under, the, grounds, that, he, was, underage, declared, the, six, nations, were, not, subject, to, the, laws, of, canada, and, he, had, no, right, to, refuse, her, son, because, canadian, laws, did, not, apply, to, them, as, she, explained, the, iroquois, regarded, the, covenant, chain, as, still, being, in, effect, meaning, the, iroquois, were, only, fighting, in, the, war, in, response, to, an, appeal, for, help, from, their, ally, king, george, v, who, had, asked, them, to, enlist, in, the, cef, the, complex, political, environment, which, emerged, in, canada, with, the, haudenosaunee, grew, out, of, the, anglo, american, era, of, european, colonization, at, the, end, of, the, war, of, 1812, britain, shifted, indian, affairs, from, the, military, to, civilian, control, with, the, creation, of, the, canadian, confederation, in, 1867, civil, authority, and, thus, indian, affairs, passed, to, canadian, officials, with, britain, retaining, control, of, military, and, security, matters, at, the, turn, of, the, century, the, canadian, government, began, passing, a, series, of, acts, which, were, strenuously, objected, to, by, the, iroquois, confederacy, during, world, war, i, an, act, attempted, to, conscript, six, nations, men, for, military, service, under, the, soldiers, resettlement, act, legislation, was, introduced, to, redistribute, native, land, finally, in, 1920, an, act, was, proposed, to, force, citizenship, on, indians, with, or, without, their, consent, which, would, then, automatically, remove, their, share, of, any, tribal, lands, from, tribal, trust, and, make, the, land, and, the, person, subject, to, the, laws, of, canada, the, haudenosaunee, hired, a, lawyer, to, defend, their, rights, in, the, supreme, court, of, canada, the, supreme, court, refused, to, take, the, case, declaring, that, the, members, of, the, six, nations, were, british, citizens, in, effect, as, canada, was, at, the, time, a, division, of, the, british, government, it, was, not, an, international, state, as, defined, by, international, law, in, contrast, the, iroquois, confederacy, had, been, making, treaties, and, functioning, as, a, state, since, 1643, and, all, of, their, treaties, had, been, negotiated, with, britain, not, canada, as, a, result, a, decision, was, made, in, 1921, to, send, a, delegation, to, petition, the, king, george, v, whereupon, canada, s, external, affairs, division, blocked, issuing, passports, in, response, the, iroquois, began, issuing, their, own, passports, and, sent, levi, general, the, cayuga, chief, deskaheh, to, england, with, their, attorney, winston, churchill, dismissed, their, complaint, claiming, that, it, was, within, the, realm, of, canadian, jurisdiction, and, referred, them, back, to, canadian, officials, on, december, 4, 1922, charles, stewart, superintendent, of, indian, affairs, and, duncan, campbell, scott, deputy, superintendent, of, the, canadian, department, of, indian, affairs, traveled, to, brantford, to, negotiate, a, settlement, on, the, issues, with, the, six, nations, after, the, meeting, the, native, delegation, brought, the, offer, to, the, tribal, council, as, was, customary, under, haudenosaunee, law, the, council, agreed, to, accept, the, offer, but, before, they, could, respond, the, royal, canadian, mounted, police, conducted, a, liquor, raid, on, the, iroquois, grand, river, territory, the, siege, lasted, three, days, and, prompted, the, haudenosaunee, to, send, deskaheh, to, washington, d, c, to, meet, with, the, charg, d, affaires, of, the, netherlands, asking, the, dutch, queen, to, sponsor, them, for, membership, in, the, league, of, nations, under, pressure, from, the, british, the, netherlands, reluctantly, refused, sponsorship, deskaheh, and, the, tribal, attorney, proceeded, to, geneva, and, attempted, to, gather, support, on, 27, september, 1923, delegates, representing, estonia, ireland, panama, and, persia, signed, a, letter, asking, for, communication, of, the, six, nations, petition, to, the, league, s, assembly, but, the, effort, was, blocked, six, nations, delegates, traveled, to, the, hague, and, back, to, geneva, attempting, to, gain, supporters, and, recognition, while, back, in, canada, the, government, was, drafting, a, mandate, to, replace, the, traditional, haudenosaunee, confederacy, council, with, one, that, would, be, elected, under, the, auspices, of, the, canadian, indian, act, in, an, unpublicized, signing, on, september, 17, 1924, prime, minister,

the, long, term, effect, of, the, order, was, that, the, canadian, government, had, wrested, control, over, the, haudenosaunee, trust, funds, from, the, iroquois, confederation, and, decades, of, litigation, would, follow, in, 1979, over, 300, indian, chiefs, visited, london, to, oppose, patriation, of, the, canadian, constitution, fearing, that, their, rights, to, be, recognized, in, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, would, be, jeopardized, in, 1981, hoping, again, to, clarify, that, judicial, responsibilities, of, treaties, signed, with, britain, were, not, transferred, to, canada, several, alberta, indian, chiefs, filed, a, petition, with, the, british, high, court, of, justice, they, lost, the, case, but, gained, an, invitation, from, the, canadian, government, to, participate, in, the, constitutional, discussions, which, dealt, with, protection, of, treaty, rights, in, 1990, a, long, running, dispute, over, ownership, of, land, at, oka, quebec, caused, a, violent, stand, off, the, mohawk, reservation, at, oka, had, become, dominated, by, a, group, called, the, mohawk, warrior, society, that, engaged, in, practices, that, american, and, canadian, authorities, considered, smuggling, across, the, u, s, canada, border, and, were, well, armed, with, assault, rifles, on, july, 11, 1990, the, mohawk, warrior, society, tried, to, stop, the, building, of, a, golf, course, on, land, claimed, by, the, mohawk, people, which, led, to, a, shoot, out, between, the, warrior, society, and, the, s, ret, du, qu, bec, that, left, a, policeman, dead, in, the, resulting, oka, crisis, the, warrior, society, occupied, both, the, land, that, they, claimed, belonged, to, the, mohawk, people, and, the, mercier, bridge, linking, the, island, of, montreal, to, the, south, shore, of, the, st, lawrence, river, on, august, 17, 1990, quebec, premier, robert, bourassa, asked, for, the, canadian, army, to, intervene, to, maintain, public, safety, leading, to, the, deployment, of, the, royal, 22, e, r, giment, to, oka, and, montreal, the, stand, off, ended, on, september, 26, 1990, with, a, melee, between, the, soldiers, and, the, warriors, the, dispute, over, ownership, of, the, land, at, oka, continues, in, the, period, between, world, war, ii, and, the, sixties, the, u, s, government, followed, a, policy, of, indian, termination, for, its, native,

unauthorized, taking, of, land, dishonorable, or, unfair, dealings, or, inadequate, compensation, claims, had, to, be, filed, within, a, five, year, period, and, most, of, the, 370, complaints, that, were, submitted, were, filed, at, the, approach, of, the, five, year, deadline, in, august, 1951, on, july, 2, 1948, congress, enacted, 62, stat, 1224, which, transferred, criminal, jurisdiction, over, offenses, committed, by, and, against, indians, to, the, state, of, new, york, it, covered, all, reservations, lands, within, the, state, and, prohibited, the, deprivation, of, hunting, and,

the, state, from, enforcing, judgments, regarding, any, land, disputes, or, applying, any, state, laws, to, tribal, lands, or, claims, prior, to, the, effective, date, of, the, law, september, 13, 1952, during, congressional, hearings, on, the, law, tribes, strongly, opposed, its, passage, fearful, that, states, would, deprive, them, of, their, reservations, the, state, of, new, york, disavowed, any, intention, to, break, up, or, deprive, tribes, of, their, reservations, and, asserted, that, they, did, not, have, the, ability, to, do, so, on, august, 1, 1953, u, s, congress, issued, a, formal, statement, house, concurrent, resolution, 108, which, was, the, formal, policy, presentation, announcing, the, official, federal, policy, of, indian, termination, the, resolution,

resolution, also, called, for, the, interior, department, to, quickly, identify, other, tribes, who, would, be, ready, for, termination, in, the, near, future, beginning, in, 1953, a, federal, task, force, began, meeting, with, the, tribes, of, the, six, nations, despite, tribal, objections, legislation, was, introduced, into, congress, for, termination, the, proposed, legislation, involved, more, than, 11, 000, indians, of, the, iroquois, confederation, and, was, divided, into, two, separate, bills, one, bill, dealt, with, the, mohawk, oneida, onondaga, cayuga, and, tuscarora, tribes, and, the, other, dealt, with, the, seneca, the, arguments, the, six, nations, made, in, their, hearings, with, committees, were, that, their, treaties, showed, that, the, u, s, recognized, that, their, lands, belonged, to, the, six, nations, not, the, u, s, and, that, termination, contradicted, any, reasonable, interpretation, that, their, lands, would, not, be, claimed, or, their, nations, disturbed, by, the, federal, government, the, bill, for, the, iroquois, confederation, died, in, committee, without, further, serious, consideration, on, august, 31, 1964, h, r, 1794, an, act, to, authorize, payment, for, certain, interests, in, lands, within, the, allegheny, indian, reservation, in, new, york, was, passed, by, congress, and, sent, to, the, president, for, signature, the, bill, authorized, payment, for, resettling, and, rehabilitation, of, the, seneca, indians, who, were, being, dislocated, by, the, construction, of, the, kinzua, dam, on, the, allegheny, river, though, only, 127, seneca, families, about, 500, people, were, being, dislocated, the, legislation, benefited, the, entire, seneca, nation, because, the, taking, of, the, indian, land, for, the, dam, abridged, a, 1794, treaty, agreement, in, addition, the, bill, provided, that, within, three, years, a, plan, from, the, interior, secretary, should, be, submitted, to, congress, withdrawing, all, federal, supervision, over, the, seneca, nation, though, technically, civil, and, criminal, jurisdiction, had, lain, with, the, state, of, new, york, since, 1950, accordingly, on, september, 5, 1967, a, memo, from, the, department, of, the, interior, announced, proposed, legislation, was, being, submitted, to, end, federal, ties, with, the, seneca, in, 1968, a, new, liaison, was, appointed, from, the, bia, for, the, tribe, to, assist, the, tribe, in, preparing, for, termination, and, rehabilitation, the, seneca, were, able, to, hold, off, termination, until, president, nixon, issued, his, special, message, to, the, congress, on, indian, affairs, in, july, 1970, no, new, york, tribes, then, living, in, the, state, were, terminated, during, this, period, one, tribe, that, had, formerly, lived, in, new, york, did, lose, its, federal, recognition, the, emigrant, indians, of, new, york, included, the, oneida, stockbridge, munsee, and, brothertown, indians, of, wisconsin, in, an, effort, to, fight, termination, and, force, the, government, into, recognizing, their, outstanding, land, claims, in, new, york, the, three, tribes, filed, litigation, with, the, claims, commission, in, the, 1950s, they, won, their, claim, on, august, 11, 1964, public, law, 90, 93, 81, stat, 229, emigrant, new, york, indians, of, wisconsin, judgment, act, established, federal, trusteeship, to, pay, the, oneida, and, stockbridge, munsee, effectively, ending, congressional, termination, efforts, for, them, though, the, law, did, not, specifically, state, the, brothertown, indians, were, terminated, it, authorized, all, payments, to, be, made, directly, to, each, enrollee, with, special, provisions, for, minors, to, be, handled, by, the, secretary, the, payments, were, not, subject, to, state, or, federal, taxes, beginning, in, 1978, the, brothertown, indians, submitted, a, petition, to, regain, federal, recognition, in, 2012, the, department, of, the, interior, in, the, final, determination, on, the, brothertown, petition, found, that, congress, had, terminated, their, tribal, status, when, it, granted, them, citizenship, in, 1838, and, therefore, only, congress, could, restore, their, tribal, status, they, are, still, seeking, congressional, approval, for, the, haudenosaunee, grief, for, a, loved, one, who, died, was, a, powerful, emotion, they, believed, that, if, it, was, not, attended, to, it, would, cause, all, sorts, of, problems, for, the, grieving, who, would, go, mad, if, left, without, consolation, rituals, to, honor, the, dead, were, very, important, and, the, most, important, of, all, was, the, condolence, ceremony, to, provide, consolation, for, those, who, lost, a, family, member, or, friend, since, it, was, believed, that, the, death, of, a, family, member, also, weakened, the, spiritual, strength, of, the, surviving, family, members, it, was, considered, crucially, important, to, replace, the, lost, family, member, by, providing, a, substitute, who, could, be, adopted, or, alternatively, could, be, tortured, to, provide, an, outlet, for, the, grief, hence, the, mourning, wars, one, of, the, central, features, of, traditional, iroquois, life, were, the, mourning, wars, when, their, warriors, would, raid, neighboring, peoples, in, search, of, captives, to, replace, those, haudenosaunee, who, had, died, war, for, the, haudenosaunee, was, primarily, undertaken, for, captives, they, were, not, concerned, with, such, goals, as, expansion, of, territory, or, glory, in, battle, as, were, the, europeans, they, did, however, go, to, war, to, control, hunting, grounds, especially, as, the, fur, trade, became, more, lucrative, a, war, party, was, considered, successful, if, it, took, many, prisoners, without, suffering, losses, in, return, killing, enemies, was, considered, acceptable, if, necessary, but, disapproved, of, as, it, reduced, the, number, of, potential, captives, taking, captives, were, considered, far, more, important, than, scalps, additionally, war, served, as, a, way, for, young, men, to, demonstrate, their, valor, and, courage, this, was, a, prerequisite, for, a, man, to, be, made, a, chief, and, it, was, also, essential, for, men, who, wanted, to, marry, haudenosaunee, women, admired, warriors, who, were, brave, in, war, in, the, pre, contact, era, war, was, relatively, bloodless, as, first, nations, peoples, did, not, have, guns, and, fought, one, another, in, suits, of, wooden, armor, in, 1609, the, french, explorer, samuel, de, champlain, observed, several, battles, between, the, algonquin, and, the, iroquois, that, resulted, in, hardly, any, deaths, this, seemed, to, be, the, norm, for, first, nations, wars, at, a, battle, between, the, algonquin, and, the, iroquois, by, the, shores, of, lake, champlain, the, only, people, killed, were, two, iroquois, warriors, hit, by, bullets, from, champlain, s, musket, in, a, demonstration, to, his, algonquin, allies, the, clan, mothers, would, demand, a, mourning, war, to, provide, consolation, and, renewed, spiritual, strength, for, a, family, that, lost, a, member, to, death, either, the, warriors, would, go, on, a, mourning, war, or, would, be, marked, by, the, clan, mothers, as, cowards, forever, which, made, them, unmarriageable, at, this, point, the, warriors, would, usually, leave, to, raid, a, neighboring, people, in, search, of, captives, the, captives, were, either, adopted, into, haudenosaunee, families, to, become, assimilated, or, were, to, be, killed, after, bouts, of, ritualized, torture, as, a, way, of, expressing, rage, at, the, death, of, a, family, member, the, male, captives, were, usually, received, with, blows, passing, through, a, kind, of, gantlet, as, they, were, brought, into, the, community, all, captives, regardless, of, their, sex, or, age, were, stripped, naked, and, tied, to, poles, in, the, middle, of, the, community, after, having, sensitive, parts, of, their, bodies, burned, and, some, of, their, fingernails, pulled, out, the, prisoners, were, allowed, to, rest, and, given, food, and, water, in, the, following, days, the, captives, had, to, dance, naked, before, the, community, when, individual, families, decided, for, each, if, the, person, was, to, be, adopted, or, killed, women, and, children, were, more, often, adopted, than, were, older, men, if, those, who, were, adopted, into, the, haudenosaunee, families, made, a, sincere, effort, to, become, haudenosaunee, then, they, would, be, embraced, by, the, community, and, if, they, did, not, then, they, were, swiftly, executed, those, slated, for, execution, had, to, wear, red, and, black, facial, paint, and, were, adopted, by, a, family, who, addressed, the, prisoner, as, uncle, aunt, nephew, or, niece, depending, on, their, age, and, sex, and, would, bring, them, food, and, water, the, captive, would, be, executed, after, a, day, long, torture, session, of, burning, and, removing, body, parts, which, the, prisoner, was, expected, to, bear, with, stoicism, and, nobility, an, expectation, not, usually, met, before, being, scalped, alive, hot, sand, was, applied, to, the, exposed, skull, and, they, were, finally, killed, by, cutting, out, their, hearts, afterward, the, victim, s, body, was, cut, and, eaten, by, the, community, the, practice, of, ritual, torture, and, execution, together, with, cannibalism, ended, some, time, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, the, late, 18th, century, european, writers, such, as, philip, mazzei, and, james, adair, were, denying, that, the, haudenosaunee, engaged, in, ritual, torture, and, cannibalism, saying, they, had, seen, no, evidence, of, such, practices, during, their, visits, to, haudenosaunee, villages, in, 1711, onondaga, chief, teganissorens, told, sir, robert, hunter, governor, of, new, york, we, are, not, like, you, christians, for, when, you, have, prisoners, of, one, another, you, send, them, home, by, such, means, you, can, never, rout, one, another, the, converse, of, this, strategy, was, that, the, iroquois, would, not, accept, losses, in, battle, as, it, defeated, the, whole, purpose, of, the, mourning, wars, which, was, to, add, to, their, numbers, not, decrease, them, the, french, during, their, wars, with, the, haudenosaunee, were, often, astonished, when, a, war, party, that, was, on, the, verge, of, victory, over, them, could, be, made, to, retreat, by, killing, one, or, two, of, their, number, the, european, notion, of, a, glorious, death, in, battle, had, no, counterpart, with, the, haudenosaunee, death, in, battle, was, accepted, only, when, absolutely, necessary, and, the, iroquois, believed, the, souls, of, those, who, died, in, battle, were, destined, to, spend, eternity, as, angry, ghosts, haunting, the, world, in, search, of, vengeance, for, this, reason, those, who, died, in, battle, were, never, buried, in, community, cemeteries, as, it, would, bring, the, presence, of, unhappy, ghosts, into, the, community, the, haudenosaunee, engaged, in, tactics, that, the, french, the, british, and, the, americans, all, considered, to, be, cowardly, until, the, americans, adopted, similar, guerrilla, tactics, the, haudenosaunee, preferred, ambushes, and, surprise, attacks, would, almost, never, attack, a, fortified, place, or, attack, frontally, and, would, retreat, if, outnumbered, if, kanienkeh, was, invaded, the, haudenosaunee, would, attempt, to, ambush, the, enemy, or, alternatively, they, would, retreat, behind, the, wooden, walls, of, their, villages, to, endure, a, siege, if, the, enemy, appeared, too, powerful, as, when, the, french, invaded, kanienkeh, in, 1693, the, haudenosaunee, burned, their, villages, and, their, crops, and, the, entire, population, retreated, into, the, woods, to, wait, for, the, french, to, depart, the, main, weapons, for, the, iroquois, were, bows, and, arrows, with, flint, tips, and, quivers, made, from, corn, husks, shields, and, war, clubs, were, made, from, wood, after, contact, was, established, with, europeans, the, native, americans, adopted, such, tools, as, metal, knives, and, hatchets, and, made, their, tomahawks, with, iron, or, steel, blades, it, has, been, posited, that, the, tomahawk, was, not, used, extensively, in, battle, but, instead, became, associated, with, the, haudenosaunee, through, european, depictions, that, sought, to, portray, natives, as, savage, and, threatening, before, taking, to, the, field, war, chiefs, would, lead, ritual, purification, ceremonies, in, which, the, warriors, would, dance, around, a, pole, painted, red, european, infectious, diseases, such, as, smallpox, devastated, the, five, nations, in, the, 17th, century, causing, thousands, of, deaths, as, they, had, no, acquired, immunity, to, the, new, diseases, which, had, been, endemic, among, europeans, for, centuries, the, league, began, a, period, of, mourning, wars, without, precedent, compounding, deaths, from, disease, they, nearly, annihilated, the, huron, petun, and, neutral, peoples, by, the, 1640s, it, is, estimated, that, smallpox, had, reduced, the, population, of, the, haudenosaunee, by, least, 50, massive, mourning, wars, were, undertaken, to, make, up, these, losses, the, american, historian, daniel, richter, wrote, it, was, at, this, point, that, war, changed, from, being, sporadic, small, scale, raids, launched, in, response, to, individual, deaths, and, became, the, constant, and, increasing, undifferentiated, symptom, of, societies, in, demographic, crisis, the, introduction, of, guns, which, could, pierce, the, wooden, armor, made, first, nations, warfare, bloodier, and, more, deadly, than, it, had, been, in, the, pre, contact, era, this, ended, the, age, when, armed, conflicts, were, more, brawls, than, battles, as, europeans, would, have, understood, the, term, at, the, same, time, guns, could, only, be, obtained, by, trading, furs, with, the, europeans, once, the, haudenosaunee, exhausted, their, supplies, of, beaver, by, about, 1640, they, were, forced, to, buy, beaver, pelts, from, indians, living, further, north, which, led, them, to, attempt, to, eliminate, other, middlemen, in, order, to, monopolize, the, fur, trade, in, a, series, of, beaver, wars, richter, wrote, the, mourning, war, tradition, deaths, from, disease, dependence, on, firearms, and, the, trade, in, furs, combined, to, produce, a, dangerous, spiral, epidemics, led, to, deadlier, mourning, wars, fought, with, firearms, the, need, for, guns, increased, the, need, for, pelts, to, trade, for, them, the, quest, for, furs, provoked, wars, with, other, nations, and, deaths, in, those, wars, began, the, mourning, war, cycle, anew, from, 1640, to, 1701, the, five, nations, was, almost, continuously, at, war, battling, at, various, times, the, french, huron, erie, neutral, lenape, susquenhannock, petun, abenaki, ojibwa, and, algonquin, peoples, fighting, campaigns, from, virginia, to, the, mississippi, and, all, the, way, to, what, is, now, northern, ontario, despite, taking, thousands, of, captives, the, five, nations, populations, continued, to, fall, as, diseases, continued, to, take, their, toll, french, jesuits, whom, the, haudenosaunee, were, forced, to, accept, after, making, peace, with, the, french, in, 1667, encouraged, catholic, converts, to, move, to, mission, villages, in, the, st, lawrence, river, valley, near, montreal, and, quebec, in, the, 1640s, the, mohawk, could, field, about, 800, warriors, by, the, 1670s, they, could, field, only, 300, warriors, indicating, population, decline, the, iroquois, league, traditions, allowed, for, the, dead, to, be, symbolically, replaced, through, captives, taken, in, mourning, wars, the, blood, feuds, and, vendettas, that, were, an, essential, aspect, of, iroquois, culture, as, a, way, of, expediting, the, mourning, process, raids, were, conducted, to, take, vengeance, and, seize, captives, captives, were, generally, adopted, directly, by, the, grieving, family, to, replace, the, member, s, who, had, been, lost, this, process, not, only, allowed, the, iroquois, to, maintain, their, own, numbers, but, also, to, disperse, and, assimilate, their, enemies, the, adoption, of, conquered, peoples, especially, during, the, period, of, the, beaver, wars, 1609, 1701, meant, that, the, iroquois, league, was, composed, largely, of, naturalized, members, of, other, tribes, cadwallader, colden, wrote, it, has, been, a, constant, maxim, with, the, five, nations, to, save, children, and, young, men, of, the, people, they, conquer, to, adopt, them, into, their, own, nation, and, to, educate, them, as, their, own, children, without, distinction, these, young, people, soon, forget, their, own, country, and, nation, and, by, this, policy, the, five, nations, make, up, the, losses, which, their, nation, suffers, by, the, people, they, lose, in, war, those, who, attempted, to, return, to, their, families, were, harshly, punished, for, instance, the, french, fur, trader, pierre, esprit, radisson, was, captured, by, an, iroquois, raiding, party, as, a, teenager, was, adopted, by, a, mohawk, family, and, ran, away, to, return, to, his, family, in, trois, rivi, res, when, he, was, recaptured, he, was, punished, by, having, his, fingernails, pulled, out, and, having, one, of, his, fingers, cut, to, the, bone, but, radisson, was, not, executed, as, his, adoptive, parents, provided, gifts, to, the, families, of, the, men, whom, radisson, had, killed, when, he, escaped, given, as, compensation, for, their, loss, several, huron, who, escaped, with, radisson, and, were, recaptured, were, quickly, executed, by, 1668, two, thirds, of, the, oneida, village, were, assimilated, algonquian, and, huron, at, onondaga, there, were, native, americans, of, seven, different, nations, and, among, the, seneca, eleven, they, also, adopted, european, captives, as, did, the, catholic, mohawk, in, settlements, outside, montreal, this, tradition, of, adoption, and, assimilation, was, common, to, native, people, of, the, northeast, at, the, time, of, first, european, contact, the, iroquois, lived, in, a, small, number, of, large, villages, scattered, throughout, their, territory, each, nation, had, between, one, and, four, villages, at, any, one, time, and, villages, were, moved, approximately, every, five, to, twenty, years, as, soil, and, firewood, were, depleted, these, settlements, were, surrounded, by, a, palisade, and, usually, located, in, a, defensible, area, such, as, a, hill, with, access, to, water, because, of, their, appearance, with, the, palisade, europeans, termed, them, castles, villages, were, usually, built, on, level, or, raised, ground, surrounded, by, log, palisades, and, sometimes, ditches, within, the, villages, the, inhabitants, lived, in, longhouses, longhouses, varied, in, size, from, 15, to, 150, feet, long, and, 15, to, 25, feet, in, breadth, longhouses, were, usually, built, of, layers, of, elm, bark, on, a, frame, of, rafters, and, standing, logs, raised, upright, in, 1653, dutch, official, and, landowner, adriaen, van, der, donck, described, a, mohawk, longhouse, in, his, description, of, new, netherland, their, houses, are, mostly, of, one, and, the, same, shape, without, any, special, embellishment, or, remarkable, design, when, building, a, house, large, or, small, for, sometimes, they, build, them, as, long, as, some, hundred, feet, though, never, more, than, twenty, feet, wide, they, stick, long, thin, peeled, hickory, poles, in, the, ground, as, wide, apart, and, as, long, as, the, house, is, to, be, the, poles, are, then, bent, over, and, fastened, one, to, another, so, that, it, looks, like, a, wagon, or, arbor, as, are, put, in, gardens, next, strips, like, split, laths, are, laid, across, these, poles, from, one, end, to, the, other, this, is, then, well, covered, all, over, with, very, tough, bark, from, one, end, of, the, house, to, the, other, along, the, center, they, kindle, fires, and, the, area, left, open, which, is, also, in, the, middle, serves, as, a, chimney, to, release, the, smoke, often, there, are, sixteen, or, eighteen, families, in, a, house, this, means, that, often, a, hundred, or, a, hundred, and, fifty, or, more, lodge, in, one, house, usually, between, 2, and, 20, families, lived, in, a, single, longhouse, with, sleeping, platforms, being, 2, feet, above, the, ground, and, food, left, to, dry, on, the, rafters, a, castle, might, contain, twenty, or, thirty, longhouses, in, addition, to, the, castles, the, iroquois, also, had, smaller, settlements, which, might, be, occupied, seasonally, by, smaller, groups, for, example, for, fishing, or, hunting, living, in, the, smoke, filled, longhouses, often, caused, conjunctivitis, total, population, for, the, five, nations, has, been, estimated, at, 20, 000, before, 1634, after, 1635, the, population, dropped, to, around, 6, 800, chiefly, due, to, the, epidemic, of, smallpox, introduced, by, contact, with, european, settlers, the, iroquois, lived, in, extended,

the, main, woods, used, by, the, iroquois, to, make, their, utensils, were, oak, birch, hickory, and, elm, bones, and, antlers, were, used, to, make, hunting, and, fishing, equipment, the, iroquois, are, a, mix, of, horticulturalists, farmers, fishers, gatherers, and, hunters, though, traditionally, their, main, diet, has, come, from, farming, for, the, iroquois, farming, was, traditionally,

the, name, and, resumes, his, previous, one, although, the, iroquois, are, sometimes, mentioned, as, examples, of, groups, who, practiced, cannibalism, the, evidence, is, mixed, as, to, whether, such, a, practice, could, be, said, to, be, widespread, among, the, six, nations, and, to, whether, it, was, a, notable, cultural, feature, some, anthropologists, have, found, evidence, of, ritual, torture, and, cannibalism, at, iroquois, sites, for, example, among, the, onondaga, in, the, sixteenth, century, however, other, scholars, such, as, anthropologist, william, arens, in, his, controversial, book, the, man, eating, myth, have, challenged, the, evidence, suggesting, the, human, bones, found, at, sites, point, to, funerary, practices, asserting, that, if, cannibalism, was, practiced, among, the, iroquois, it, was, not, widespread, modern, anthropologists, seem, to, accept, the, probability, that, cannibalism, did, exist, among, the, iroquois, with, thomas, abler, describing, the, evidence, from, the, jesuit, relations, and, archaeology, as, making, a, case, for, cannibalism, in, early, historic, times, so, strong, that, it, cannot, be, doubted, scholars, are, also, urged, to, remember, the, context, for, a, practice, that, now, shocks, the, modern, western, society, sanday, reminds, us, that, the, ferocity, of, the, iroquois, rituals, cannot, be, separated, from, the, severity, of, conditions, where, death, from, hunger, disease, and, warfare, became, a, way, of, life, the, missionaries, johannes, megapolensis, fran, ois, joseph, bressani, and, the, fur, trader, pierre, esprit, radisson, present, first, hand, accounts, of, cannibalism, among, the, mohawk, a, common, theme, is, ritualistic, roasting, and, eating, the, heart, of, a, captive, who, has, been, tortured, and, killed, to, eat, your, enemy, is, to, perform, an, extreme, form, of, physical, dominance, haudenosaunee, peoples, participated, in, mourning, wars, to, obtain, captives, leland, donald, suggests, in, slavery, in, indigenous, north, america, that, captives, and, slaves, were, interchangeable, roles, there, have, been, archaeological, studies, to, support, that, haudenosaunee, peoples, did, in, fact, have, a, hierarchal, system, that, included, slaves, note, that, the, term, slave, in, haudenosaunee, culture, is, identified, by, spiritual, and, revengeful, purposes, not, to, be, mistaken, for, the, term, in, the, african, slave, trade, however, once, african, slavery, was, introduced, into, north, america, by, european, settlers, some, iroquois, such, as, mohawk, chief, joseph, brant, did, own, african, slaves, to, obtain, captives, haudenosaunee, peoples, fought, mourning, wars, after, the, wars, were, over, haudenosaunee, warriors, journeyed, back, to, their, villages, with, the, enemies, taken, captive, during, these, journeys, captives, were, routinely, tortured, or, even, killed, by, their, captors, leland, donald, writes, that, captives, were, killed, if, they, could, not, keep, up, tried, to, escape, or, members, of, the, attacking, party, could, not, restrain, their, emotions, daniel, richter, suggests, that, keeping, the, pace, may, not,

on, the, march, back, to, a, haudenosaunee, village, the, torture, did, not, end, captives, were, mutilated, and, beaten, for, several, days, upon, arrival, by, haudenosaunee, warriors, after, the, initiation, process, they, were, either, killed, or, welcomed, into, the, nation, where, they, would, be, replacing, a, deceased, member, of, that, community, the, iroquois, have, absorbed, many, other, individuals, from, various, peoples, into, their, tribes, as, a, result, of, adopting, war, captives, and, giving, refuge, to, displaced, peoples, when, such, adoptees, become, fully, assimilated, they, are, considered, full, members, of, their, adoptive, families, clans, and, tribes, historically, such, adoptees, have, married, into, the, tribes, and, some, have, become, chiefs, or, respected, elders, slaves, brought, onto, haudenosaunee, territory, were, mainly, adopted, into, families, or, kin, groups, that, had, lost, a, person, although, if, that, person, had, been, vital, for, the, community, they, were, usually, replaced, by, other, kin, group, members, and, captives, were, adopted, to, fill, lesser, places, during, adoption, rituals, slaves, were, to, reject, their, former, life, and, be, renamed, as, part, of, their, genuine, assimilation, the, key, goal, of, haudenosaunee, slavery, practices, was, to, have, slaves, assimilate, to, haudenosaunee, culture, to, rebuild, population, after, one, or, many, deaths, children, and, indigenous, peoples, of, neighbouring, villages, to, the, haudenosaunee, are, said, to, have, been, good, slaves, because, of, their, better, ability, to, assimilate, that, being, said, the, role, of, a, slave, was, not, a, limited, position, and, whenever, slaves, were, available, for, capture, they, were, taken, no, matter, their, age, race, gender, etc, once, adopted, slaves, in, haudenosaunee, communities, had, potential, to, move, up, in, society, since, slaves, were, replacing, dead, nation, members, they, took, on, the, role, of, that, former, member, if, they, could, prove, that, they, could, live, up, to, it, their, rights, within, the, aforementioned, framework, were, still, limited, though, meaning, slaves, performed, chores, or, labor, for, their, adoptive, families, also, there, are, a, few, cases, where, slaves, were, never, adopted, into, families, and, their, only, role, was, to, perform, tasks, in, the, village, these, types, of, slaves, may, have, been, used, solely, for, exchange, slave, trade, was, common, in, haudenosaunee, culture, and, it, aimed, to, increase, haudenosaunee, population, slaves, were, often, tortured, once, captured, by, the, haudenosaunee, torture, methods, consisted, of, most, notably, finger, mutilation, among, other, things, slaves, endured, torture, not, only, on, their, journey, back, to, haudenosaunee, nations, but, also, during, initiation, rituals, and, sometimes, throughout, their, enslavement, finger, mutilation, was, common, as, a, sort, of, marking, of, a, slave, in, northern, iroquoian, slavery, starna, and, watkins, suggest, that, sometimes, torture, was, so, brutal, that, captives, died, before, being, adopted, initial, torture, upon, entry, into, the, haudenosaunee, culture, also, involved, binding, bodily, mutilation, with, weapons, and, starvation, and, for, female, slaves, sexual, assault, starvation, may, have, lasted, longer, depending, on, the, circumstance, louis, hennepin, was, captured, by, haudenosaunee, peoples, in, the, 17th, century, and, recalled, being, starved, during, his, adoption, as, one, of, aquipaguetin, s, replacement, sons, indigenous, slaves, were, also, starved, by, their, captors, such, as, hennepin, was, the, brutality, of, haudenosaunee, slavery, was, not, without, its, purposes, torture, was, used, to, demonstrate, a, power, dynamic, between, the, slave, and, the, master, to, constantly, remind, the, slave, that, they, were, inferior, language, played, another, role, in, haudenosaunee, slavery, practices, slaves, were, often, referred, to, as, domestic, animals, or, dogs, which, were, equivalent, to, the, word, to, slave, this, use, of, language, suggests, that, slaves, were, dehumanized, that, slaves, were, domesticated, and, another, that, slaves, were, to, be, eaten, as, haudenosaunee, peoples, ate, dogs, jacques, bruyas, wrote, a, dictionary, of, the, mohawk, language, where, the, word, gatsennen, is, defined, as, animal, domestique, serviteur, esclave, english, domestic, animal, butler, slave, there, are, also, more, language, accounts, of, slaves, being, compared, to, animals, mostly, dogs, in, oneida, and, onondaga, language, this, language, serves, as, a, proof, not, only, that, slavery, did, exist, but, also, that, slaves, were, at, the, bottom, of, the, hierarchy, inevitably, haudenosaunee, slavery, practices, changed, after, european, contact, with, the, arrival, of, european, introduced, infectious, diseases, came, the, increase, in, haudenosaunee,

haudenosaunee, populations, were, made, up, mostly, of, captives, from, other, nations, among, the, indigenous, groups, targeted, by, the, haudenosaunee, were, the, wyandot, who, were, captured, in, such, large, numbers, that, they, lost, their, independence, for, a, large, period, of, time, mourning, wars, became, essential, to, rebuilding, their, numbers, while, at, the, same, time, haudenosaunee, warriors, began, launching, raids, on, european, colonial, settlements, similarly, to, indigenous, slaves, european, slaves, were, tortured, by, the, haudenosaunee, using, finger, mutilation, and, sometimes, cannibalism, european, captives, did, not, make, good, slaves, because, they, resisted, even, more, than, indigenous, captives, and, did, not, understand, rituals, such, as, renaming, and, forgetting, their, past, for, this, reason, most, european, captives, were, either, used, as, ransom, or, murdered, upon, arrival, to, haudenosaunee, territory, many, europeans, who, were, not, captured, became, trading, partners, with, the, haudenosaunee, indigenous, slaves, were, now, being, traded, amongst, european, settlers, and, some, slaves, even, ended, up, in, quebec, households, eventually, european, contact, led, to, adoptees, outnumbering, the, haudenosaunee, in, their, own, communities, the, difficulty, of, controlling, these, slaves, in, large,

the, grand, council, in, the, 19th, century, he, interpreted, it, as, a, central, government, this, interpretation, became, influential, but, richter, argues, that, while, the, grand, council, served, an, important, ceremonial, role, it, was, not, a, government, in, the, sense, that, morgan, thought, according, to, this, view, iroquois, political, and, diplomatic, decisions, are, made, on, the, local, level, and, are, based, on, assessments, of, community, consensus, a, central, government, that, develops, policy, and, implements, it, for, the, people, at, large, is, not, the, iroquois, model, of, government, unanimity, in, public, acts, was, essential, to, the, council, in, 1855, minnie, myrtle, observed, that, no, iroquois, treaty, was, binding, unless, it, was, ratified, by, 75,

whelk, and, snow, whelk, are, used, wampum, was, primarily, used, to, make, wampum, belts, by, the, iroquois, which, iroquois, tradition, claims, was, invented, by, hiawatha, to, console, chiefs, and, clan, mothers, who, lost, family, members, to, war, wampum, belts, played, a, major, role, in, the, condolence, ceremony, and, in, the, raising, of, new, chiefs, wampum, belts, are, used, to, signify, the, importance, of, a, specific, message, being, presented, treaty, making, often, involved, wampum, belts, to, signify, the, importance, of, the, treaty, a, famous, example, is, the, two, row, wampum, or, guesuenta, meaning, it, brightens, our, minds, which, was, originally, presented, to, the, dutch, settlers, and, then, french, representing, a, canoe, and, a, sailboat, moving, side, by,

of, peace, traditionally, the, onondaga, are, the, peace, keepers, of, the, confederacy, the, placement, of, the, nations, on, the, belt, represents, the, actually, geographical, distribution, of, the, six, nations, over, their, shared, territory, with, the, seneca, in, the, far, west, and, the, mohawk, in, the, far, east, of, iroquois, territory, the, haudenosaunee, flag, created, in, the, 1980s, is, based, on, the, hiawatha, belt, created, from, purple, and, white, wampum, beads, centuries, ago, to, symbolize, the, union, forged, when, the, former, enemies, buried, their, weapons, under, the, great, tree, of, peace, it, represents, the, original, five, nations, that, were, united, by, the, peacemaker, and, hiawatha, the, tree, symbol, in, the, center, represents, an, eastern, white, pine, the, needles, of, which, are, clustered, in, groups, of, five, historians, in, the, 20th, century, have, suggested, the, iroquois, system, of, government, influenced, the, development, of, the, u, s, government, although, the, extent, and, nature, of, this, influence, has, been, disputed, bruce, johansen, proposes, that, the, iroquois, had, a, representative, form, of, government, consensus, has, not, been, reached, on, how, influential, the, iroquois, model, was, to, the, development, of, u, s, documents, such, as, the, articles, of, confederation, and, the, u, s, constitution, the, influence, thesis, has, been, discussed, by, historians, such, as, donald, grinde, and, bruce, johansen, in, 1988, the, u, s, congress, passed, a, resolution, to, recognize, the, influence, of, the, iroquois, league, upon, the, constitution, and, bill, of, rights, in, 1987, cornell, university, held, a, conference, on, the, link, between, the, iroquois, government, and, the, u, s, constitution, scholars, such, as, jack, n, rakove, challenge, this, thesis, stanford, university, historian, rakove, writes, the, voluminous, records, we, have, for, the, constitutional, debates, of, the, late, 1780s, contain, no, significant, references, to, the, iroquois, and, notes, that, there, are, ample, european, precedents, to, the, democratic, institutions, of, the, u, s, in, reply, journalist, charles, c, mann, wrote, that, while, he, agreed, that, the, specific, form, of, government, created, for, the, u, s, was, not, at, all, like, that, of, the, iroquois, available, evidence, does, support, a, cultural, argument, that, the, well, known, democratic, spirit, had, much, to, do, with, colonial, contact, with, the, indians, of, the, eastern, seaboard, including, and, especially, the, iroquois, and, quoting, rakove, that, prolonged, contact, between, the, aboriginal, and, colonizing, populations, were, important, elements, in, the, shaping, of, colonial, society, and, culture, historian, francis, jennings, noted, that, supporters, of, the, thesis, frequently, cite, the, following, statement, by, benjamin, franklin, made, in, a, letter, from, benjamin, franklin, to, james, parker, in, 1751, it, would, be, a, very, strange, thing, if, six, nations, of, ignorant, savages, should, be, capable, of, forming, a, scheme, for, such, a, union, and, yet, that, a, like, union, should, be, impracticable, for, ten, or, a, dozen, english, colonies, but, he, disagrees, that, it, establishes, influence, rather, he, thinks, franklin, was, promoting, union, against, the, ignorant, savages, and, called, the, idea, absurd, the, anthropologist, dean, snow, has, stated, that, although, franklin, s, albany, plan, may, have, drawn, inspiration, from, the, iroquois, league, there, is, little, evidence, that, either, the, plan, or, the, constitution, drew, substantially, from, that, source, he, argues, that, such, claims, muddle, and, denigrate, the, subtle, and, remarkable, features, of, iroquois, government, the, two, forms, of, government, are, distinctive, and, individually, remarkable, in, conception, similarly, the, anthropologist, elisabeth, tooker, has, concluded, that, there, is, virtually, no, evidence, that, the, framers, borrowed, from, the, iroquois, she, argues, that, the, idea, is, a, myth, resulting, from, a, claim, made, by, linguist, and, ethnographer, j, n, b, hewitt, that, was, exaggerated, and, misunderstood, after, his, death, in, 1937, according, to, tooker, the, original, iroquois, constitution, did, not, involve, representative, democracy, and, elections, deceased, chiefs, successors, were, selected, by, the, most, senior, woman, within, the, hereditary, lineage, in, consultation, with, other, women,

years, on, the, contrary, lewis, h, morgan, in, his, 1851, book, estimated, the, iroquois, population, in, year, 1650, at, 25, 000, people, including, 10, 000, seneca, 5, 000, mohawk, 4, 000,
