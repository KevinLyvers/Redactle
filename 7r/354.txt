the, semitic, languages, are, a, branch, of, the, afroasiatic, language, family, they, include, arabic, amharic, aramaic, hebrew, maltese, and, numerous, other, ancient, and, modern, languages, they, are, spoken, by, more, than, 330, million, people, across, much, of, west, asia, north, africa, the, horn, of, africa, malta, and, in, large, immigrant, and, expatriate, communities, in, north, america, europe, and, australasia, the, terminology, was, first, used, in, the, 1780s, by, members, of, the, g, ttingen, school, of, history, who, derived, the, name, from, shem, one, of, the, three, sons, of, noah, in, the, book, of, genesis, semitic, languages, occur, in, written, form, from, a, very, early, historical, date, in, west, asia, with, east, semitic, akkadian, also, known, as, assyrian, and, babylonian, and, eblaite, texts, written, in, a, script, adapted, from, sumerian, cuneiform, appearing, from, c, 2600, bce, in, mesopotamia, and, the, northeastern, levant, respectively, the, only, earlier, attested, languages, are, sumerian, and, elamite, 2800, bce, to, 550, bce, both, language, isolates, and, egyptian, c, 3000, bce, a, sister, branch, within, the, afroasiatic, family, related, to, the, semitic, languages, but, not, part, of, them, amorite, appeared, in, mesopotamia, and, the, northern, levant, c, 2100, bc, followed, by, the, mutually, intelligible, canaanite, languages, including, hebrew, phoenician, moabite, edomite, and, ammonite, and, perhaps, ekronite, amalekite, and, sutean, the, still, spoken, aramaic, and, ugaritic, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, most, scripts, used, to, write, semitic, languages, are, abjads, a, type, of, alphabetic, script, that, omits, some, or, all, of, the, vowels, which, is, feasible, for, these, languages, because, the, consonants, are, the, primary, carriers, of, meaning, in, the, semitic, languages, these, include, the, ugaritic, phoenician, aramaic, hebrew, syriac, arabic, and, ancient, south, arabian, alphabets, the, ge, ez, script, used, for, writing, the, semitic, languages, of, ethiopia, and, eritrea, is, technically, an, abugida, a, modified, abjad, in, which, vowels, are, notated, using, diacritic, marks, added, to, the, consonants, at, all, times, in, contrast, with, other, semitic, languages, which, indicate, vowels, based, on, need, or, for, introductory, purposes, maltese, is, the, only, semitic, language, written, in, the, latin, script, and, the, only, semitic, language, to, be, an, official, language, of, the, european, union, the, semitic, languages, are, notable, for, their, nonconcatenative, morphology, that, is, word, roots, are, not, themselves, syllables, or, words, but, instead, are, isolated, sets, of, consonants, usually, three, making, a, so, called, triliteral, root, words, are, composed, from, roots, not, so, much, by, adding, prefixes, or, suffixes, but, rather, by, filling, in, the, vowels, between, the, root, consonants, although, prefixes, and, suffixes, are, often, added, as, well, for, example, in, arabic, the, root, meaning, write, has, the, form, k, t, b, from, this, root, words, are, formed, by, filling, in, the, vowels, and, sometimes, adding, consonants, e, g, k, i, t, b, book, k, u, t, u, b, books, k, t, i, b, writer, k, u, tt, b, writers, k, a, t, a, b, a, he, wrote, ya, kt, u, b, u, he, writes, etc, the, similarity, of, the, hebrew, arabic, and, aramaic, languages, has, been, accepted, by, all, scholars, since, medieval, times, the, languages, were, familiar, to, western, european, scholars, due, to, historical, contact, with, neighbouring, near, eastern, countries, and, through, biblical, studies, and, a, comparative, analysis, of, hebrew, arabic, and, aramaic, was, published, in, latin, in, 1538, by, guillaume, postel, almost, two, centuries, later, hiob, ludolf, described, the, similarities, between, these, three, languages, and, the, ethiopian, semitic, languages, however, neither, scholar, named, this, grouping, as, semitic, the, term, semitic, was, created, by, members, of, the, g, ttingen, school, of, history, initially, by, august, ludwig, von, schl, zer, 1781, to, designate, the, languages, closely, related, to, arabic, aramaic, and, hebrew, the, choice, of, name, was, derived, from, shem, one, of, the, three, sons, of, noah, in, the, genealogical, accounts, of, the, biblical, book, of, genesis, or, more, precisely, from, the, koine, greek, rendering, of, the, name, s, m, johann, gottfried, eichhorn, is, credited, with, popularising, the, term, particularly, via, a, 1795, article, semitische, sprachen, semitic, languages, in, which, he, justified, the, terminology, against, criticism, that, hebrew, and, canaanite, were, the, same, language, despite, canaan, being, hamitic, in, the, table, of, nations, in, the, mosaic, table, of, nations, those, names, which, are, listed, as, semites, are, purely, names, of, tribes, who, speak, the, so, called, oriental, languages, and, live, in, southwest, asia, as, far, as, we, can, trace, the, history, of, these, very, languages, back, in, time, they, have, always, been, written, with, syllabograms, or, with, alphabetic, script, never, with, hieroglyphs, or, pictograms, and, the, legends, about, the, invention, of, the, syllabograms, and, alphabetic, script, go, back, to, the, semites, in, contrast, all, so, called, hamitic, peoples, originally, used, hieroglyphs, until, they, here, and, there, either, through, contact, with, the, semites, or, through, their, settlement, among, them, became, familiar, with, their, syllabograms, or, alphabetic, script, and, partly, adopted, them, viewed, from, this, aspect, too, with, respect, to, the, alphabet, used, the, name, semitic, languages, is, completely, appropriate, previously, these, languages, had, been, commonly, known, as, the, oriental, languages, in, european, literature, in, the, 19th, century, semitic, became, the, conventional, name, however, an, alternative, name, syro, arabian, languages, was, later, introduced, by, james, cowles, prichard, and, used, by, some, writers, semitic, languages, were, spoken, and, written, across, much, of, the, middle, east, and, asia, minor, during, the, bronze, age, and, iron, age, the, earliest, attested, being, the, east, semitic, akkadian, of, mesopotamia, akkad, assyria, isin, larsa, and, babylonia, from, the, third, millennium, bc, the, origin, of, semitic, speaking, peoples, is, still, under, discussion, several, locations, were, proposed, as, possible, sites, of, a, prehistoric, origin, of, semitic, speaking, peoples, mesopotamia, the, levant, ethiopia, the, eastern, mediterranean, region, the, arabian, peninsula, and, north, africa, according, to, a, 2009, study, the, semitic, languages, originated, in, the, levant, c, 3750, bc, and, were, introduced, to, the, horn, of, africa, c, 800, bc, from, the, southern, arabian, peninsula, and, to, north, africa, via, phoenician, colonists, at, approximately, the, same, time, others, assign, the, arrival, of, semitic, speakers, in, the, horn, of, africa, to, a, much, earlier, date, according, to, another, hypothesis, semitic, originated, from, an, offshoot, of, a, still, earlier, language, in, north, africa, and, desertification, made, its, inhabitants, to, migrate, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, into, what, is, now, ethiopia, others, northwest, out, of, africa, into, west, asia, the, various, extremely, closely, related, and, mutually, intelligible, canaanite, languages, a, branch, of, the, northwest, semitic, languages, included, edomite, hebrew, ammonite, moabite, phoenician, punic, carthaginian, samaritan, hebrew, and, ekronite, they, were, spoken, in, what, is, today, israel, and, the, palestinian, territories, syria, lebanon, jordan, the, northern, sinai, peninsula, some, northern, and, eastern, parts, of, the, arabian, peninsula, southwest, fringes, of, turkey, and, in, the, case, of, phoenician, coastal, regions, of, tunisia, carthage, libya, algeria, and, parts, of, morocco, spain, and, possibly, in, malta, and, other, mediterranean, islands, ugaritic, a, northwest, semitic, language, closely, related, to, but, distinct, from, the, canaanite, group, was, spoken, in, the, kingdom, of, ugarit, in, north, western, syria, a, hybrid, canaano, akkadian, language, also, emerged, in, canaan, israel, and, the, palestinian, territories, jordan, lebanon, during, the, 14th, century, bc, incorporating, elements, of, the, mesopotamian, east, semitic, akkadian, language, of, assyria, and, babylonia, with, the, west, semitic, canaanite, languages, aramaic, a, still, living, ancient, northwest, semitic, language, first, attested, in, the, 12th, century, bc, in, the, northern, levant, gradually, replaced, the, east, semitic, and, canaanite, languages, across, much, of, the, near, east, particularly, after, being, adopted, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, vast, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 605, bc, by, tiglath, pileser, iii, during, the, 8th, century, bc, and, being, retained, by, the, succeeding, neo, babylonian, and, achaemenid, empires, the, chaldean, language, not, to, be, confused, with, aramaic, or, its, biblical, variant, sometimes, referred, to, as, chaldean, was, a, northwest, semitic, language, possibly, closely, related, to, aramaic, but, no, examples, of, the, language, remain, as, after, settling, in, south, eastern, mesopotamia, from, the, levant, during, the, 9th, century, bc, the, chaldeans, appear, to, have, rapidly, adopted, the, akkadian, and, aramaic, languages, of, the, indigenous, mesopotamians, old, south, arabian, languages, classified, as, south, semitic, and, therefore, distinct, from, the, central, semitic, arabic, were, spoken, in, the, kingdoms, of, dilmun, sheba, ubar, socotra, and, magan, which, in, modern, terms, encompassed, part, of, the, eastern, coast, of, saudi, arabia, and, bahrain, qatar, oman, and, yemen, south, semitic, languages, are, thought, to, have, spread, to, the, horn, of, africa, circa, 8th, century, bc, where, the, ge, ez, language, emerged, though, the, direction, of, influence, remains, uncertain, classical, syriac, a, 200, ce, eastern, middle, aramaic, dialect, used, as, a, liturgical, language, in, mesopotamia, the, levant, and, kerala, india, rose, to, importance, as, a, literary, language, of, early, christianity, in, the, third, to, fifth, centuries, and, continued, into, the, early, islamic, era, the, arabic, language, although, originating, in, the, arabian, peninsula, first, emerged, in, written, form, in, the, 1st, to, 4th, centuries, ce, in, the, southern, regions, of, the, levant, with, the, advent, of, the, early, arab, conquests, of, the, seventh, and, eighth, centuries, classical, arabic, eventually, replaced, many, but, not, all, of, the, indigenous, semitic, languages, and, cultures, of, the, near, east, both, the, near, east, and, north, africa, saw, an, influx, of, muslim, arabs, from, the, arabian, peninsula, followed, later, by, non, semitic, muslim, iranian, and, turkic, peoples, the, previously, dominant, aramaic, dialects, maintained, by, the, assyrians, babylonians, and, persians, gradually, began, to, be, sidelined, however, descendant, dialects, of, eastern, aramaic, including, suret, assyrian, and, chaldean, varieties, turoyo, and, mandaic, survive, to, this, day, among, the, assyrians, syriacs, and, mandaeans, of, northern, and, southern, iraq, northwestern, iran, northeastern, syria, and, southeastern, turkey, with, up, to, a, million, fluent, speakers, syriac, is, a, recognized, language, in, iraq, furthermore, mesopotamian, arabic, is, one, of, the, most, syriac, influenced, dialects, of, arabic, due, to, syriac, the, dialect, of, edessa, specifically, having, originated, in, mesopotamia, meanwhile, western, aramaic, is, now, only, spoken, by, a, few, thousand, christian, and, muslim, arameans, syriacs, in, western, syria, the, arabs, spread, their, central, semitic, language, to, north, africa, egypt, libya, tunisia, algeria, morocco, and, northern, sudan, and, mauritania, where, it, gradually, replaced, egyptian, coptic, and, many, berber, languages, although, berber, is, still, largely, extant, in, many, areas, and, for, a, time, to, the, iberian, peninsula, modern, spain, portugal, and, gibraltar, and, malta, with, the, patronage, of, the, caliphs, and, the, prestige, of, its, liturgical, status, arabic, rapidly, became, one, of, the, world, s, main, literary, languages, its, spread, among, the, masses, took, much, longer, however, as, many, although, not, all, of, the, native, populations, outside, the, arabian, peninsula, only, gradually, abandoned, their, languages, in, favour, of, arabic, as, bedouin, tribes, settled, in, conquered, areas, it, became, the, main, language, of, not, only, central, arabia, but, also, yemen, the, fertile, crescent, and, egypt, most, of, the, maghreb, followed, specifically, in, the, wake, of, the, banu, hilal, s, incursion, in, the, 11th, century, and, arabic, became, the, native, language, of, many, inhabitants, of, al, andalus, after, the, collapse, of, the, nubian, kingdom, of, dongola, in, the, 14th, century, arabic, began, to, spread, south, of, egypt, into, modern, sudan, soon, after, the, beni, ass, n, brought, arabization, to, mauritania, a, number, of, modern, south, arabian, languages, distinct, from, arabic, still, survive, such, as, soqotri, mehri, and, shehri, which, are, mainly, spoken, in, socotra, yemen, and, oman, meanwhile, the, semitic, languages, that, had, arrived, from, southern, arabia, in, the, 8th, century, bc, were, diversifying, in, ethiopia, and, eritrea, where, under, heavy, cushitic, influence, they, split, into, a, number, of, languages, including, amharic, and, tigrinya, with, the, expansion, of, ethiopia, under, the, solomonic, dynasty, amharic, previously, a, minor, local, language, spread, throughout, much, of, the, country, replacing, both, semitic, such, as, gafat, and, non, semitic, such, as, weyto, languages, and, replacing, ge, ez, as, the, principal, literary, language, though, ge, ez, remains, the, liturgical, language, for, christians, in, the, region, this, spread, continues, to, this, day, with, qimant, set, to, disappear, in, another, generation, arabic, is, currently, the, native, language, of, majorities, from, mauritania, to, oman, and, from, iraq, to, sudan, classical, arabic, is, the, language, of, the, quran, it, is, also, studied, widely, in, the, non, arabic, speaking, muslim, world, the, maltese, language, is, a, descendant, of, the, extinct, siculo, arabic, a, variety, of, maghrebi,

is, restricted, to, the, city, of, harar, ge, ez, remains, the, liturgical, language, for, certain, groups, of, christians, in, ethiopia, and, in, eritrea, the, phonologies, of, the, attested, semitic, languages, are, presented, here, from, a, comparative, point, of, view, see, proto, semitic, language, phonology, for, details, on, the, phonological, reconstruction, of, proto, semitic, used, in, this, article, the, reconstruction, of, proto, semitic, ps, was, originally, based, primarily, on, arabic, whose, phonology, and, morphology, particularly, in, classical, arabic, is, very, conservative, and, which, preserves, as, contrastive, 28, out, of, the, evident, 29, consonantal, phonemes, with, s, and, merging, into, arabic, s, and, becoming, arabic, note, the, fricatives, s, z, and, may, also, be, interpreted, as, affricates, t, s, d, z, t, s, t, t, and, t, as, discussed, in, proto, semitic, language, fricatives, this, comparative, approach, is, natural, for, the, consonants, as, sound, correspondences, among, the, consonants, of, the, semitic, languages, are, very, straightforward, for, a, family, of, its, time, depth, sound, shifts, affecting, the, vowels, are, more, numerous, and, at, times, less, regular, each, proto, semitic, phoneme, was, reconstructed, to, explain, a, certain, regular, sound, correspondence, between, various, semitic, languages, note, that, latin, letter, values, italicized, for, extinct, languages, are, a, question, of, transcription, the, exact, pronunciation, is, not, recorded, most, of, the, attested, languages, have, merged, a, number, of, the, reconstructed, original, fricatives, though, south, arabian, retains, all, fourteen, and, has, added, a, fifteenth, from, p, f, in, aramaic, and, hebrew, all, non, emphatic, stops, occurring, singly, after, a, vowel, were, softened, to, fricatives, leading, to, an, alternation, that, was, often, later, phonemicized, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, gemination, in, languages, exhibiting, pharyngealization, of, emphatics, the, original, velar, emphatic, has, rather, developed, to, a, uvular, stop, note, the, fricatives, s, z, and, may, also, be, interpreted, as, affricates, t, s, d, z, t, s, t, t, and, t, notes, the, following, table, shows, the, development, of, the, various, fricatives, in, hebrew, aramaic, arabic, and, maltese, through, cognate, words, mien, xahar, sliem, tnejn, d, d, da, aq, olm, g, arb, sebg, a, proto, semitic, vowels, are, in, general, harder, to, deduce, due, to, the, nonconcatenative, morphology, of, semitic, languages, the, history, of, vowel, changes, in, the, languages, makes, drawing, up, a, complete, table, of, correspondences, impossible, so, only, the, most, common, reflexes, can, be, given, the, semitic, languages, share, a, number, of, grammatical, features, although, variation, both, between, separate, languages, and, within, the, languages, themselves, has, naturally, occurred, over, time, the, reconstructed, default, word, order, in, proto, semitic, is, verb, subject, object, vso, possessed, possessor, ng, and, noun, adjective, na, this, was, still, the, case, in, classical, arabic, and, biblical, hebrew, e, g, classical, arabic, ra, mu, ammadun, far, dan, literally, saw, muhammad, farid, muhammad, saw, farid, in, the, modern, arabic, vernaculars, however, as, well, as, sometimes, in,

different, from, those, used, in, the, suffix, conjugation, indicate, number, and, gender, whenever, the, prefix, does, not, mark, this, the, prefix, conjugation, is, noted, for, a, particular, pattern, of, t, y, n, prefixes, where, 1, a, t, prefix, is, used, in, the, singular, to, mark, the, second, person, and, third, person, feminine, while, a, y, prefix, marks, the, third, person, masculine, and, 2, identical, words, are, used, for, second, person, masculine, and, third, person, feminine, singular, the, prefix, conjugation, is, extremely, old, with, clear, analogues, in, nearly, all, the, families, of, afroasiatic, languages, i, e, at, least, 10, 000, years, old, the, table, on, the, right, shows, examples, of, the, prefix, and, suffix, conjugations, in, classical, arabic, which, has, forms, that, are, close, to, proto, semitic, in, proto, semitic, as, still, largely, reflected, in, east, semitic, prefix, conjugations, are, used, both, for, the, past, and, the,

retracted, stress, the, west, semitic, languages, significantly, reshaped, the, system, the, most, substantial, changes, occurred, in, the, central, semitic, languages, the, ancestors, of, modern, hebrew, arabic, and, aramaic, essentially, the, old, prefix, conjugated, jussive, or, preterite, became, a, new, non, past, or, imperfect, while, the, stative, became, a, new, past, or, perfect, and, the, old, prefix, conjugated, non, past, or, imperfect, with, gemination, was, discarded, new, suffixes, were, used, to, mark, different, moods, in, the, non, past, e, g, classical, arabic, u,

past, vs, non, past, or, aspect, i, e, perfect, vs, imperfect, a, special, feature, in, classical, hebrew, is, the, waw, consecutive, prefixing, a, verb, form, with, the, letter, waw, in, order, to, change, its, tense, or, aspect, the, south, semitic, languages, show, a, system, somewhere, between, the, east, and, central, semitic, languages, later, languages, show, further, developments, in, the, modern, varieties, of, arabic, for, example, the, old, mood, suffixes, were, dropped, and, new, mood, prefixes, developed, e, g, bi, for, indicative, vs, no, prefix, for, subjunctive, in, many, varieties, in, the, extreme, case, of, neo, aramaic, the, verb, conjugations, have, been, entirely, reworked, under, iranian, influence, all, semitic, languages, exhibit, a, unique, pattern, of, stems, called, semitic, roots, consisting, typically, of, triliteral, or, three, consonant, consonantal, roots, two, and, four, consonant, roots, also, exist, from, which, nouns, adjectives, and, verbs, are, formed, in, various, ways, e, g, by, inserting, vowels, doubling, consonants, lengthening, vowels, or, by, adding, prefixes, suffixes, or, infixes, for, instance, the, root, k, t, b, dealing, with, writing, generally, yields, in, arabic, and, the, same, root, in, hebrew, underlined, consonants, represent, the, fricatives, x, v, respectively, in, tigrinya, and, amharic, this, root, was, used, widely, but, is, now, seen, as, an, archaic, form, ethiopic, derived, languages, use, different, roots, for, things, that, have, to, do, with, writing, and, in, some, cases, counting, the, primitive, root, f, and, the, trilateral, root, stems, m, f, h, f, and, f, r, are, used, this, root, also, exists, in, other, semitic, languages, such, as, hebrew, sep, er, book, s, p, er, scribe, misp, r, number, and, sipp, r, story, this, root, also, exists, in, arabic, and, is, used, to, form, words, with, a, close, meaning, to, writing, such, as, a, fa, journalism, and, a, fa, newspaper, or, parchment, verbs, in, other, non, semitic, afroasiatic, languages, show, similar, radical, patterns, but, more, usually, with, biconsonantal, roots, e, g, kabyle, afeg, means, fly, while, affug, means, flight, and, yufeg, means, he, flew, compare, with, hebrew, where, hap, l, means, set, sail, hap, l, means, a, sailing, trip, and, hip, l, means, he, sailed, while, the, unrelated, p, t, p, and, p, pertain, to, flight, these, are, the, basic, numeral, stems, without, feminine, suffixes, in, most, older, semitic, languages, the, forms, of, the, numerals, from, 3, to, 10, exhibit, polarity, of, gender, also, called, chiastic, concord, or, reverse, agreement, i, e, if, the, counted, noun, is, masculine, the, numeral, would, be, feminine, and, vice, versa, some, early, semitic, languages, are, speculated, to, have, had, weak, ergative, features, due, to, the, semitic, languages, common, origin, they, share, some, words, and, roots, others, differ, for, example, terms, given, in, brackets, are, not, derived, from, the, respective, proto, semitic, roots, though, they, may, also, derive, from, proto, semitic, as, does, e, g, arabic, d, r, cf, biblical, hebrew, d, r, dwelling, sometimes, certain, roots, differ, in, meaning, from, one, semitic, language, to, another, for, example, the, root, b, y, in, arabic, has, the, meaning, of, white, as, well, as, egg, whereas, in, hebrew, it, only, means, egg, the, root, l, b, n, means, milk, in, arabic, but, the, color, white, in, hebrew, the, root, l, m, means, meat, in, arabic, but, bread, in, hebrew, and, cow, in, ethiopian, semitic, the, original, meaning, was, most, probably, food, the, word, medina, root, d, y, n, d, w, n, has, the, meaning, of, metropolis, in, amharic, city, in, arabic, and, ancient, hebrew, and, state, in, modern, hebrew, of, course, there, is, sometimes, no, relation, between, the, roots, for, example, knowledge, is, represented, in, hebrew, by, the, root, y, d, but, in, arabic, by, the, roots, r, f, and, l, m, and, in, ethiosemitic, by, the, roots, w, q, and, f, l, for, more, comparative, vocabulary, lists, see, the, wiktionary, appendix, list, of, proto, semitic, stems, there, are, six, fairly, uncontroversial, nodes, within, the, semitic, languages, east, semitic, northwest, semitic, north, arabian, old, south, arabian, also, known, as, sayhadic, modern, south, arabian, and, ethiopian, semitic, these, are, generally, grouped, further, but, there, is, ongoing, debate, as, to, which, belong, together, the, classification, based, on, shared, innovations, given, below, established, by, robert, hetzron, in, 1976, and, with, later, emendations, by, john, huehnergard, and, rodgers, as, summarized, in, hetzron, 1997, is, the, most, widely, accepted, today, in, particular, several, semiticists, still, argue, for, the, traditional, partially, nonlinguistic, view, of, arabic, as, part, of, south, semitic, and, a, few, e, g, alexander, militarev, or, the, german, egyptian, professor, arafa, hussein, mustafa, see, modern, south, arabian, as, a, third, branch, of, semitic, alongside, east, and, west, semitic, rather, than, as, a, subgroup, of, south, semitic, however, a, new, classification, groups, old, south, arabian, as, central, semitic, instead, roger, blench, notes, that, the, gurage, languages, are, highly, divergent, and, wonders, whether, they, might, not, be, a, primary, branch, reflecting, an, origin, of, afroasiatic, in, or, near, ethiopia, at, a, lower, level, there, is, still, no, general, agreement, on, where, to, draw, the, line, between, languages, and, dialects, an, issue, particularly, relevant, in, arabic, aramaic, and, gurage, and, the, strong, mutual, influences, between, arabic, dialects, render, a, genetic, subclassification, of, them, particularly, difficult, a, computational, phylogenetic, analysis, by, kitchen, et, al, 2009, considers, the, semitic, languages, to, have, originated, in, the, levant, c, 3750, bce, during, the, early, bronze, age, with, early, ethiosemitic, originating, from, southern, arabia, c, 800, bce, evidence, for, gene, movements, consistent, with, this, were, found, in, almarri, et, al, 2021, the, himyaritic, and, sutean, languages, appear, to, have, been, semitic, but, are, unclassified, due, to, insufficient, data, the, following, is, a, list, of, some, modern, and, ancient, semitic, speaking, peoples, and, nations
