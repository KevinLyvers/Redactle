the, afroasiatic, languages, or, afro, asiatic, sometimes, afrasian, also, known, as, hamito, semitic, or, semito, hamitic, are, a, language, family, or, phylum, of, about, 400, languages, spoken, predominantly, in, west, asia, north, africa, the, horn, of, africa, and, parts, of, the, sahara, and, sahel, over, 500, million, people, are, native, speakers, of, an, afroasiatic, language, constituting, the, fourth, largest, language, family, after, indo, european, sino, tibetan, and, niger, congo, most, linguists, divide, the, family, into, six, branches, berber, chadic, cushitic, egyptian, semitic, and, omotic, the, vast, majority, of, afroasiatic, languages, are, considered, indigenous, to, the, african, continent, including, all, those, not, belonging, to, the, semitic, branch, arabic, if, counted, as, a, single, language, is, by, far, the, most, widely, spoken, within, the, family, with, around, 300, million, native, speakers, concentrated, primarily, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, other, major, afroasiatic, languages, include, the, chadic, hausa, language, with, over, 34, million, native, speakers, the, semitic, amharic, language, with, 25, million, and, the, cushitic, somali, language, with, 15, million, other, afroasiatic, languages, with, millions, of, native, speakers, include, the, semitic, tigrinya, and, modern, hebrew, the, cushitic, sidaama, and, the, omotic, wolaitta, language, though, most, languages, within, the, family, are, much, smaller, in, size, there, are, many, well, attested, afroasiatic, languages, from, antiquity, that, have, since, died, or, gone, extinct, including, egyptian, and, the, semitic, languages, akkadian, biblical, hebrew, phoenician, amorite, and, ugaritic, there, is, no, consensus, among, historical, linguists, as, to, precisely, where, or, when, the, common, ancestor, of, all, afroasiatic, languages, known, as, proto, afroasiatic, was, originally, spoken, however, most, agree, that, the, afroasiatic, homeland, was, located, somewhere, in, northeastern, africa, with, specific, proposals, including, the, horn, of, africa, egypt, and, the, eastern, sahara, a, significant, minority, of, scholars, argues, for, an, origin, in, the, levant, the, reconstructed, timelines, of, when, proto, afroasiatic, was, spoken, vary, extensively, with, dates, ranging, from, 18, 000, bc, to, 8, 000, bc, even, the, latest, plausible, dating, makes, afroasiatic, the, oldest, language, family, accepted, by, contemporary, linguists, comparative, study, of, afroasiatic, is, hindered, by, the, massive, disparities, in, textual, attestation, between, its, branches, while, the, semitic, and, egyptian, branches, are, attested, in, writing, as, early, as, the, fourth, millennium, bc, berber, cushitic, and, omotic, languages, were, often, not, recorded, until, the, 19th, or, 20th, centuries, while, systematic, sound, laws, have, not, yet, been, established, to, explain, the, relationships, between, the, various, branches, of, afroasiatic, the, languages, share, a, number, of, common, features, one, of, the, most, important, for, establishing, membership, in, the, branch, is, a, common, set, of, pronouns, other, widely, shared, features, include, a, prefix, m, which, creates, nouns, from, verbs, evidence, for, alternations, between, the, vowel, a, and, a, high, vowel, in, the, forms, of, the, verb, similar, methods, of, marking, gender, and, plurality, and, some, details, of, phonology, such, as, the, presence, of, pharyngeal, fricatives, other, features, found, in, multiple, branches, include, a, specialized, verb, conjugation, using, suffixes, egyptian, semitic, berber, a, specialized, verb, conjugation, using, prefixes, semitic, berber, cushitic, verbal, prefixes, deriving, middle, t, causative, s, and, passive, m, verb, forms, semitic, berber, egyptian, cushitic, and, a, suffix, used, to, derive, adjectives, egyptian, semitic, in, current, scholarship, the, most, common, names, for, the, family, are, afroasiatic, or, afro, asiatic, hamito, semitic, and, semito, hamitic, other, proposed, names, that, have, yet, to, find, widespread, acceptance, include, erythraic, erythraean, lisramic, noahitic, and, lamekhite, friedrich, m, ller, introduced, the, name, hamito, semitic, to, describe, the, family, in, his, grundriss, der, sprachwissenschaft, 1876, the, variant, semito, hamitic, is, mostly, used, in, older, russian, sources, the, elements, of, the, name, were, derived, from, the, names, of, two, sons, of, noah, as, attested, in, the, book, of, genesis, s, table, of, nations, passage, semitic, from, the, first, born, shem, and, hamitic, from, the, second, born, ham, genesis, 5, 32, within, the, table, of, nations, each, of, noah, s, sons, is, presented, as, the, common, progenitor, of, various, people, groups, deemed, to, be, closely, related, among, others, shem, was, the, father, of, the, jews, assyrians, and, arameans, while, ham, was, the, father, of, the, egyptians, and, cushites, this, genealogy, does, not, reflect, the, actual, origins, of, these, peoples, languages, for, example, the, canaanites, are, descendants, of, ham, according, to, the, table, even, though, hebrew, is, now, classified, as, a, canaanite, language, while, the, elamites, are, ascribed, to, shem, despite, their, language, being, totally, unrelated, to, hebrew, the, term, semitic, for, the, semitic, languages, had, already, been, coined, in, 1781, by, august, ludwig, von, schl, zer, following, an, earlier, suggestion, by, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, in, 1710, hamitic, was, first, used, by, ernest, renan, in, 1855, to, refer, to, languages, that, appeared, similar, to, the, semitic, languages, but, were, not, themselves, provably, a, part, of, the, family, the, belief, in, a, connection, between, africans, and, the, biblical, ham, which, had, existed, at, least, as, far, back, as, isidore, of, seville, in, the, 6th, century, ad, led, scholars, in, the, early, 19th, century, to, speak, vaguely, of, hamian, or, hamitish, languages, the, term, hamito, semitic, has, largely, fallen, out, of, favor, among, linguists, writing, in, english, but, is, still, frequently, used, in, the, scholarship, of, various, other, languages, such, as, german, several, issues, with, the, label, hamito, semitic, have, led, many, scholars, to, abandon, the, term, and, criticize, its, continued, use, one, common, objection, is, that, the, hamitic, component, inaccurately, suggests, that, a, monophyletic, hamitic, branch, exists, alongside, semitic, in, addition, joseph, greenberg, has, argued, that, hamitic, possesses, racial, connotations, and, that, hamito, semitic, overstates, the, centrality, of, the, semitic, languages, within, the, family, by, contrast, victor, porkhomovsky, suggests, that, the, label, is, simply, an, inherited, convention, and, doesn, t, imply, a, duality, of, semitic, and, hamitic, any, more, than, indo, european, implies, a, duality, of, indic, and, european, because, of, its, use, by, several, important, scholars, and, in, the, titles, of, significant, works, of, scholarship, the, total, replacement, of, hamito, semitic, is, difficult, while, greenberg, ultimately, popularized, the, name, afroasiatic, in, 1960, it, appears, to, have, been, coined, originally, by, maurice, delafosse, as, french, afroasiatique, in, 1914, the, name, refers, to, the, fact, that, it, is, the, only, major, language, family, with, large, populations, in, both, africa, and, asia, due, to, concerns, that, afroasiatic, could, imply, the, inclusion, of, all, languages, spoken, across, africa, and, asia, the, name, afrasian, russian, afrazijskije, was, proposed, by, igor, diakonoff, in, 1980, at, present, it, predominantly, sees, use, among, russian, scholars, the, names, lisramic, based, on, the, afroasiastic, root, lis, tongue, and, the, egyptian, word, rm, person, and, erythraean, referring, to, the, core, area, around, which, the, languages, are, spoken, the, red, sea, have, also, been, proposed, scholars, generally, consider, afroasiatic, to, have, between, five, and, eight, branches, the, five, that, are, universally, agreed, upon, are, berber, also, called, libyco, berber, chadic, cushitic, egyptian, and, semitic, most, specialists, consider, the, omotic, languages, to, constitute, a, sixth, branch, due, to, the, presumed, distance, of, relationship, between, the, various, branches, many, scholars, prefer, to, refer, to, afroasiatic, as, a, linguistic, phylum, rather, than, a, language, family, m, victoria, almansa, villatoro, and, silvia, tub, ov, nigrelli, write, that, there, are, about, 400, languages, in, afroasiatic, ethnologue, lists, 375, languages, many, scholars, estimate, fewer, languages, exact, numbers, vary, depending, on, the, definitions, of, language, and, dialect, the, berber, or, libyco, berber, languages, are, spoken, today, by, perhaps, 16, million, people, they, are, often, considered, to, constitute, a, single, language, with, multiple, dialects, other, scholars, however, argue, that, they, are, a, group, of, around, twelve, languages, about, as, different, from, each, other, as, the, romance, or, germanic, languages, in, the, past, berber, languages, were, spoken, throughout, north, africa, except, in, egypt, since, the, 7th, century, ce, however, they, have, been, heavily, affected, by, arabic, and, have, been, replaced, by, it, in, many, places, there, are, two, extinct, languages, potentially, related, to, modern, berber, the, first, is, the, numidian, language, represented, by, over, a, thousand, short, inscriptions, in, the, libyco, berber, alphabet, found, throughout, north, africa, and, dating, from, the, 2nd, century, bce, onward, the, second, is, the, guanche, language, which, was, formerly, spoken, on, the, canary, islands, and, went, extinct, in, the, 17th, century, ce, the, first, longer, written, examples, of, modern, berber, varieties, only, date, from, the, 16th, or, 17th, centuries, ce, chadic, languages, number, between, 150, and, 190, making, chadic, the, largest, family, in, afroasiatic, by, number, of, extant, languages, the, chadic, languages, are, typically, divided, into, three, major, branches, east, chadic, central, chadic, and, west, chadic, most, chadic, languages, are, located, in, the, chad, basin, with, the, exception, of, hausa, hausa, is, the, largest, chadic, language, by, native, speakers, and, is, spoken, by, a, large, number, of, people, as, a, lingua, franca, in, northern, nigeria, it, may, have, as, many, as, 80, to, 100, million, first, and, second, language, speakers, eight, other, chadic, languages, have, around, 100, 000, speakers, other, chadic, languages, often, have, few, speakers, and, may, be, in, danger, of, going, extinct, only, about, 40, chadic, languages, have, been, fully, described, by, linguists, there, are, about, 30, cushitic, languages, more, if, omotic, is, included, spoken, around, the, horn, of, africa, and, in, sudan, and, tanzania, the, cushitic, family, is, traditionally, split, into, four, branches, the, single, language, of, beja, c, 3, million, speakers, the, agaw, languages, eastern, cushitic, and, southern, cushitic, only, one, cushitic, language, oromo, has, more, than, 25, million, speakers, other, languages, with, more, than, a, million, speakers, include, somali, afar, hadiyya, and, sidaama, many, cushitic, languages, have, relatively, few, speakers, cushitic, does, not, appear, to, be, related, to, the, written, ancient, languages, known, from, its, area, meroitic, or, old, nubian, the, oldest, text, in, a, cushitic, language, probably, dates, from, around, 1770, written, orthographies, were, only, developed, for, a, select, number, of, cushitic, languages, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, egyptian, branch, consists, of, a, single, language, egyptian, often, called, ancient, egyptian, which, was, historically, spoken, in, the, lower, nile, valley, egyptian, is, first, attested, in, writing, around, 3000, bce, and, finally, went, extinct, around, 1300, ce, making, it, the, language, with, the, longest, written, history, in, the, world, egyptian, is, usually, divided, into, two, major, periods, earlier, egyptian, c, 3000, 1300, bce, which, is, further, subdivided, into, old, egyptian, and, middle, egyptian, and, later, egyptian, 1300, bce, 1300, ce, which, is, further, subdivided, into, late, egyptian, demotic, and, coptic, coptic, is, the, only, stage, written, alphabetically, to, show, vowels, whereas, egyptian, was, previously, written, in, egyptian, hieroglyphs, which, only, represent, consonants, in, the, coptic, period, there, is, evidence, for, six, major, dialects, which, presumably, existed, previously, but, are, obscured, by, pre, coptic, writing, additionally, middle, egyptian, appears, to, be, based, on, a, different, dialect, than, old, egyptian, which, in, turn, shows, dialectal, similarities, to, late, egyptian, egyptian, was, replaced, by, arabic, as, the, spoken, language, of, egypt, but, coptic, continues, to, be, the, liturgical, language, of, the, coptic, orthodox, church, the, c, 30, omotic, languages, are, still, mostly, undescribed, by, linguists, they, are, all, spoken, in, southwest, ethiopia, except, for, the, ganza, language, spoken, in, sudan, omotic, is, typically, split, into, north, omotic, or, aroid, and, south, omotic, with, the, latter, more, influenced, by, the, nilotic, languages, it, is, unclear, whether, the, dizoid, group, of, omotic, languages, belongs, to, the, northern, or, southern, group, the, two, omotic, languages, with, the, most, speakers, are, wolaitta, and, gamo, gofa, dawro, with, about, 1, 2, million, speakers, each, a, majority, of, specialists, consider, omotic, to, constitute, a, sixth, branch, of, afroasiatic, omotic, was, formerly, considered, part, of, the, cushitic, branch, some, scholars, continue, to, consider, it, part, of, cushitic, other, scholars, have, questioned, whether, it, is, afroasiatic, at, all, due, its, lack, of, several, typical, aspects, of, afroasiatic, morphology, there, are, between, 40, and, 80, languages, in, the, semitic, family, today, semitic, languages, are, spoken, across, north, africa, west, asia, and, the, horn, of, africa, as, well, as, on, the, island, of, malta, making, them, the, sole, afroasiatic, branch, with, members, originating, outside, africa, arabic, spoken, in, both, asia, and, africa, is, by, far, the, most, widely, spoken, afroasiatic, language, today, with, around, 300, million, native, speakers, while, the, ethiopian, amharic, language, has, around, 25, million, collectively, semitic, is, the, largest, branch, of, afroasiatic, by, number, of, current, speakers, most, authorities, divide, semitic, into, two, branches, east, semitic, which, includes, the, extinct, akkadian, language, and, west, semitic, which, includes, arabic, aramaic, the, canaanite, languages, including, hebrew, as, well, as, the, ethiopian, semitic, languages, such, as, ge, ez, and, amharic, the, classification, within, west, semitic, remains, contested, the, only, group, with, an, african, origin, is, ethiopian, semitic, the, oldest, written, attestations, of, semitic, languages, come, from, mesopotamia, northern, syria, and, egypt, and, date, as, early, as, c, 3000, bce, there, are, also, other, proposed, branches, but, none, has, so, far, convinced, a, majority, of, scholars, there, is, no, agreement, on, the, relationships, between, and, subgrouping, of, the, different, afroasiatic, branches, whereas, marcel, cohen, 1947, claimed, he, saw, no, evidence, for, internal, subgroupings, numerous, other, scholars, have, made, proposals, with, carsten, peust, counting, 27, as, of, 2012, common, trends, in, proposals, as, of, 2019, include, using, common, or, lacking, grammatical, features, to, argue, that, omotic, was, the, first, language, to, branch, off, often, followed, by, chadic, in, contrast, to, scholars, who, argue, for, an, early, split, of, chadic, from, afroasiatic, scholars, of, the, russian, school, tend, to, argue, that, chadic, and, egyptian, are, closely, related, and, scholars, who, rely, on, percentage, of, shared, lexicon, often, group, chadic, with, berber, three, scholars, who, agree, on, an, early, split, between, omotic, and, the, other, subbranches, but, little, else, are, harold, fleming, 1983, christopher, ehret, 1995, and, lionel, bender, 1997, in, contrast, scholars, relying, on, shared, lexicon, often, produce, a, cushitic, omotic, group, additionally, the, minority, of, scholars, who, favor, an, asian, origin, of, afroasiatic, tend, to, place, semitic, as, the, first, branch, to, split, off, disagreement, on, which, features, are, innovative, and, which, are, inherited, from, proto, afroasiatic, produces, radically, different, trees, as, can, be, seen, by, comparing, the, trees, produced, by, ehret, and, igor, diakonoff, responding, to, the, above, tom, g, ldemann, criticizes, attempts, at, finding, subgroupings, based, on, common, or, lacking, morphology, by, arguing, that, the, presence, or, absence, of, morphological, features, is, not, a, useful, way, of, discerning, subgroupings, in, afroasiatic, because, it, can, not, be, excluded, that, families, currently, lacking, certain, features, did, not, have, them, in, the, past, this, also, means, that, the, presence, of, morphological, features, cannot, be, taken, as, defining, a, subgroup, peust, notes, that, other, factors, that, can, obscure, genetic, relationships, between, languages, include, the, poor, state, of, present, documentation, and, understanding, of, particular, language, families, historically, with, egyptian, presently, with, omotic, gene, gragg, likewise, argues, that, more, needs, to, be, known, about, omotic, still, and, that, afroasiatic, linguists, have, still, not, found, convincing, isoglosses, on, which, to, base, genetic, distinctions, one, way, of, avoiding, the, problem, of, determining, which, features, are, original, and, which, are, inherited, is, to, use, a, computational, methodology, such, as, lexicostatistics, with, one, of, the, earliest, attempts, being, fleming, 1983, this, is, also, the, method, used, by, alexander, militarev, and, sergei, starostin, to, create, a, family, tree, fleming, 2006, was, a, more, recent, attempt, by, fleming, with, a, different, result, from, militarev, and, starostin, hezekiah, bacovcin, and, david, wilson, argue, that, this, methodology, is, invalid, for, discerning, linguistic, sub, relationship, they, note, the, method, s, inability, to, detect, various, strong, commonalities, even, between, well, studied, branches, of, aa, a, relationship, between, hebrew, arabic, and, aramaic, and, the, berber, languages, was, perceived, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, ce, by, the, hebrew, grammarian, and, physician, judah, ibn, quraysh, who, is, regarded, as, a, forerunner, of, afroasiatic, studies, the, french, orientalist, guillaume, postel, had, also, pointed, out, similarities, between, hebrew, arabic, and, aramaic, in, 1538, and, hiob, ludolf, noted, similarities, also, to, ge, ez, and, amharic, in, 1701, this, family, was, formally, described, and, named, semitic, by, august, ludwig, von, schl, zer, in, 1781, in, 1844, theodor, benfey, first, described, the, relationship, between, semitic, and, the, egyptian, language, and, connected, both, to, the, berber, and, the, cushitic, languages, which, he, called, ethiopic, in, the, same, year, t, n, newman, suggested, a, relationship, between, semitic, and, the, hausa, language, an, idea, that, was, taken, up, by, early, scholars, of, afroasiatic, in, 1855, ernst, renan, named, these, languages, related, to, semitic, but, not, semitic, hamitic, in, 1860, carl, lottner, proposed, that, they, belonged, to, a, single, language, family, and, in, 1876, friedrich, m, ller, first, described, them, as, a, hamito, semitic, language, family, m, ller, assumed, that, there, existed, a, distinct, hamitic, branch, of, the, family, that, consisted, of, egyptian, berber, and, cushitic, he, did, not, include, the, chadic, languages, though, contemporary, egyptologist, karl, richard, lepsius, argued, for, the, relation, of, hausa, to, the, berber, languages, some, scholars, would, continue, to, regard, hausa, as, related, to, the, other, afroasiatic, languages, but, the, idea, was, controversial, many, scholars, refused, to, admit, that, the, largely, unwritten, negroid, chadic, languages, were, in, the, same, family, as, the, caucasian, ancient, civilizations, of, the, egyptians, and, semites, an, important, development, in, the, history, of, afroasiatic, scholarship, and, the, history, of, african, linguistics, was, the, creation, of, the, hamitic, theory, or, hamitic, hypothesis, by, lepsius, fellow, egyptologist, christian, bunsen, and, linguist, christian, bleek, this, theory, connected, the, hamites, the, originators, of, hamitic, languages, with, supposedly, culturally, superior, caucasians, who, were, assumed, to, have, migrated, into, africa, and, intermixed, with, indigenous, negroid, africans, in, ancient, times, the, hamitic, theory, would, serve, as, the, basis, for, carl, meinhof, s, highly, influential, classification, of, african, languages, in, his, 1912, book, die, sprache, der, hamiten, on, one, hand, the, hamitic, classification, was, justified, partially, based, on, linguistic, features, for, example, meinhof, split, the, presently, understood, chadic, family, into, hamito, chadic, and, an, unrelated, non, hamitic, chadic, based, on, which, languages, possessed, grammatical, gender, on, the, other, hand, the, classification, also, relied, on, non, linguistic, anthropological, and, culturally, contingent, features, such, as, skin, color, hair, type, and, lifestyle, ultimately, meinhof, s, classification, of, hamitic, proved, to, include, languages, from, every, presently, recognized, language, family, within, africa, the, first, scholar, to, question, the, existence, of, hamitic, languages, was, marcel, cohen, in, 1924, with, skepticism, also, expressed, by, a, klingenheben, and, dietrich, westermann, during, the, 1920s, and, 30s, however, meinhof, s, hamitic, classification, remained, prevalent, throughout, the, early, 20th, century, until, it, was, definitively, disproven, by, joseph, greenberg, in, the, 1940s, based, on, racial, and, anthropological, data, instead, greenberg, proposed, an, afroasiatic, family, consisting, of, five, branches, berber, chadic, cushitic, egyptian, and, semitic, reluctance, among, some, scholars, to, recognize, chadic, as, a, branch, of, afroasiatic, persisted, as, late, as, the, 1980s, in, 1969, harold, fleming, proposed, that, a, group, of, languages, classified, by, greenberg, as, cushitic, were, in, fact, their, own, independent, omotic, branch, a, proposal, that, has, been, widely, if, not, universally, accepted, these, six, branches, now, constitute, an, academic, consensus, on, the, genetic, structure, of, the, family, greenberg, relied, on, his, own, method, of, mass, comparison, of, vocabulary, items, rather, than, the, comparative, method, of, demonstrating, regular, sound, correspondences, to, establish, the, family, an, alternative, classification, based, on, the, pronominal, and, conjugation, systems, was, proposed, by, a, n, tucker, in, 1967, as, of, 2023, widely, accepted, sound, correspondences, between, the, different, branches, have, not, yet, been, firmly, established, nevertheless, morphological, traits, attributable, to, the, proto, language, and, the, establishment, of, cognates, throughout, the, family, have, confirmed, its, genetic, validity, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, when, proto, afroasiatic, was, spoken, the, absolute, latest, date, for, when, proto, afroasiatic, could, have, been, extant, is, c, 4000, bce, after, which, egyptian, and, the, semitic, languages, are, firmly, attested, however, in, all, likelihood, these, languages, began, to, diverge, well, before, this, hard, boundary, the, estimations, offered, by, scholars, as, to, when, proto, afroasiatic, was, spoken, vary, widely, ranging, from, 18, 000, bce, to, 8, 000, bce, an, estimate, at, the, youngest, end, of, this, range, still, makes, afroasiatic, the, oldest, proven, language, family, contrasting, proposals, of, an, early, emergence, tom, g, ldemann, has, argued, that, less, time, may, have, been, required, for, the, divergence, than, is, usually, assumed, as, it, is, possible, for, a, language, to, rapidly, restructure, due, to, areal, contact, with, the, evolution, of, chadic, and, likely, also, omotic, serving, as, pertinent, examples, likewise, no, consensus, exists, as, to, where, proto, afroasiatic, originated, scholars, have, proposed, locations, for, the, afroasiatic, homeland, across, africa, and, west, asia, roger, blench, writes, that, the, debate, possesses, a, strong, ideological, flavor, with, associations, between, an, asian, origin, and, high, civilization, an, additional, complicating, factor, is, the, lack, of, agreement, on, the, subgroupings, of, afroasiatic, see, further, subdivisions, this, makes, associating, archaeological, evidence, with, the, spread, of, afroasiatic, particularly, difficult, nevertheless, there, is, a, long, accepted, link, between, the, speakers, of, proto, southern, cushitic, languages, and, the, east, african, savanna, pastoral, neolithic, 5, 000, years, ago, and, archaeological, evidence, associates, the, proto, cushitic, speakers, with, economic, transformations, in, the, sahara, dating, c, 8, 500, ago, as, well, as, the, speakers, of, the, proto, zenati, variety, of, the, berber, languages, with, an, expansion, across, the, maghreb, in, the, 5th, century, ce, an, origin, somewhere, on, the, african, continent, has, broad, scholarly, support, and, is, seen, as, being, well, supported, by, the, linguistic, data, most, scholars, more, narrowly, place, the, homeland, near, the, geographic, center, of, its, present, distribution, in, the, southeastern, sahara, or, adjacent, horn, of, africa, the, afroasiatic, languages, spoken, in, africa, are, not, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, semitic, as, one, would, expect, if, only, semitic, had, remained, in, a, west, asian, homeland, while, all, other, branches, had, spread, from, there, likewise, all, semitic, languages, are, fairly, similar, to, each, other, whereas, the, african, branches, of, afroasiatic, are, very, diverse, this, suggests, the, rapid, spread, of, semitic, out, of, africa, proponents, of, an, origin, of, afroasiatic, within, africa, assume, the, proto, language, to, have, been, spoken, by, pre, neolithic, hunter, gatherers, arguing, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, words, in, proto, afroasiatic, related, to, agriculture, or, animal, husbandry, christopher, ehret, s, o, y, keita, and, paul, newman, also, argue, that, archaeology, does, not, support, a, spread, of, migrating, farmers, into, africa, but, rather, a, gradual, incorporation, of, animal, husbandry, into, indigenous, foraging, cultures, ehret, in, a, separate, publication, argued, that, the, two, principles, in, linguistic, approaches, for, determining, the, origin, of, languages, which, are, the, principles, of, fewest, moves, and, greatest, diversity, had, put, beyond, reasonable, doubt, that, the, language, family, had, originated, in, the, horn, of, africa, a, significant, minority, of, scholars, supports, an, asian, origin, of, afroasiatic, most, of, whom, are, specialists, in, semitic, or, egyptian, studies, the, main, proponent, of, an, asian, origin, is, the, linguist, alexander, militarev, who, argues, that, proto, afroasiatic, was, spoken, by, early, agriculturalists, in, the, levant, and, subsequently, spread, to, africa, militarev, associates, the, speakers, of, proto, afroasiatic, with, the, levantine, post, natufian, culture, arguing, that, the, reconstructed, lexicon, of, flora, and, fauna, as, well, as, farming, and, pastoralist, vocabulary, indicates, that, proto, aa, must, have, been, spoken, in, this, area, scholar, jared, diamond, and, archaeologist, peter, bellwood, have, taken, up, militarev, s, arguments, as, part, of, their, general, argument, that, the, spread, of, linguistic, macrofamilies, such, as, indo, european, bantu, and, austro, asiatic, can, be, associated, with, the, development, of, agriculture, they, argue, that, there, is, clear, archaeological, support, for, farming, spreading, from, the, levant, into, africa, via, the, nile, valley, afroasiatic, languages, share, a, number, of, phonetic, and, phonological, features, egyptian, cushitic, berber, omotic, and, most, languages, in, the, semitic, branch, all, require, a, syllable, to, begin, with, a, consonant, with, the, exception, of, some, grammatical, prefixes, igor, diakonoff, argues, that, this, constraint, goes, back, to, proto, afroasiatic, some, chadic, languages, allow, a, syllable, to, begin, with, a, vowel, however, in, many, chadic, languages, verbs, must, begin, with, a, consonant, in, cushitic, and, chadic, languages, a, glottal, stop, or, glottal, fricative, may, be, inserted, to, prevent, a, word, from, beginning, with, a, vowel, typically, syllables, only, begin, with, a, single, consonant, diakonoff, argues, that, proto, afroasiatic, did, not, have, consonant, clusters, within, a, syllable, with, the, exception, of, some, chadic, languages, all, afroasiatic, languages, allow, both, closed, and, open, syllables, many, chadic, languages, do, not, allow, a, syllable, to, end, in, a, consonant, most, words, end, in, a, vowel, in, omotic, and, cushitic, making, syllable, final, consonant, clusters, rare, syllable, weight, plays, an, important, role, in, aa, especially, in, chadic, it, can, affect, the, form, of, affixes, attached, to, a, word, several, afroasiatic, languages, have, large, consonant, inventories, and, it, is, likely, that, this, is, inherited, from, proto, afroasiatic, all, afroasiatic, languages, contain, stops, and, fricatives, some, branches, have, additional, types, of, consonants, such, as, affricates, and, lateral, consonants, aa, languages, tend, to, have, pharyngeal, fricative, consonants, with, egyptian, semitic, berber, and, cushitic, sharing, and, in, all, aa, languages, consonants, can, be, bilabial, alveolar, velar, and, glottal, with, additional, places, of, articulation, found, in, some, branches, or, languages, additionally, the, glottal, stop, usually, exists, as, a, phoneme, and, there, tends, to, be, no, phonemic, contrast, between, and, or, and, in, cushitic, the, ethiopian, semitic, language, tigrinya, and, some, chadic, languages, there, is, no, underlying, phoneme, at, all, most, if, not, all, branches, of, afroasiatic, distinguish, between, voiceless, voiced, and, emphatic, consonants, the, emphatic, consonants, are, typically, formed, deeper, in, the, throat, than, the, others, they, can, be, realized, variously, as, glottalized, pharyngealized, uvularized, ejective, and, or, implosive, consonants, in, the, different, branches, it, is, generally, agreed, that, only, the, obstruents, had, a, contrast, between, voiceless, and, voiced, forms, in, proto, afroasiatic, whereas, continuants, were, voiceless, a, form, of, long, distance, consonant, assimilation, known, as, consonant, harmony, is, attested, in, berber, chadic, cushitic, and, semitic, it, usually, affects, features, such, as, pharyngealization, palatalization, and, labialization, several, omotic, languages, have, sibilant, harmony, meaning, that, all, sibilants, s, sh, z, ts, etc, in, a, word, must, match, restrictions, against, the, co, occurrence, of, certain, usually, similar, consonants, in, verbal, roots, can, be, found, in, all, afroasiatic, branches, though, they, are, only, weakly, attested, in, chadic, and, omotic, the, most, widespread, constraint, is, against, two, different, labial, consonants, other, than, w, occurring, together, in, a, root, a, constraint, which, can, be, found, in, all, branches, but, omotic, another, widespread, constraint, is, against, two, non, identical, lateral, obstruents, which, can, be, found, in, egyptian, chadic, semitic, and, probably, cushitic, such, rules, do, not, always, apply, for, nouns, numerals, or, denominal, verbs, and, do, not, affect, prefixes, or, suffixes, added, to, the, root, roots, that, may, have, contained, sequences, that, were, possible, in, proto, afroasiatic, but, are, disallowed, in, the, daughter, languages, are, assumed, to, have, undergone, consonant, dissimilation, or, assimilation, a, set, of, constraints, developed, originally, by, joseph, greenberg, on, the, basis, of, arabic, has, been, claimed, to, be, typical, for, afroasiatic, languages, greenberg, divided, semitic, consonants, into, four, types, back, consonants, glottal, pharyngeal, uvular, laryngeal, and, velar, consonants, front, consonants, dental, or, alveolar, consonants, liquid, consonants, and, labial, consonants, he, showed, that, generally, any, consonant, from, one, of, these, groups, could, combine, with, consonants, from, any, other, group, but, could, not, be, used, together, with, consonants, from, the, same, group, additionally, he, showed, that, proto, semitic, restricted, a, sequence, of, two, identical, consonants, in, the, first, and, second, position, of, the, triliteral, root, these, rules, also, have, a, number, of, exceptions, similar, exceptions, can, be, demonstrated, for, the, other, aa, branches, that, have, these, restrictions, to, their, root, formation, james, p, allen, has, demonstrated, that, slightly, different, rules, apply, to, egyptian, for, instance, egyptian, allows, two, identical, consonants, in, some, roots, and, disallows, velars, from, occurring, with, pharyngeals, there, is, a, large, variety, of, vocalic, systems, in, aa, and, attempts, to, reconstruct, the, vocalic, system, of, proto, afroasiatic, vary, considerably, all, branches, of, afroasiatic, have, a, limited, number, of, underlying, vowels, between, two, and, seven, but, the, number, of, phonetic, vowels, can, be, much, larger, the, quality, of, the, underlying, vowels, varies, considerably, by, language, the, most, common, vowel, throughout, aa, is, schwa, in, the, different, languages, central, vowels, are, often, inserted, to, break, up, consonant, clusters, a, form, of, epenthesis, various, semitic, cushitic, berber, and, chadic, languages, including, arabic, amharic, berber, somali, and, east, dangla, also, exhibit, various, types, of, vowel, harmony, the, majority, of, aa, languages, are, tonal, languages, phonemic, tonality, is, found, in, omotic, chadic, and, cushitic, languages, but, absent, in, berber, and, semitic, there, is, no, information, on, whether, egyptian, had, tones, in, contemporary, omotic, chadic, and, cushitic, languages, tone, is, primarily, a, grammatical, feature, it, encodes, various, grammatical, functions, only, differentiating, lexical, roots, in, a, few, cases, in, some, chadic, and, some, omotic, languages, every, syllable, has, to, have, a, tone, whereas, in, most, cushitic, languages, this, is, not, the, case, some, scholars, postulate, that, proto, afroasiatic, may, have, had, tone, while, others, believe, it, arose, later, from, a, pitch, accent, at, present, there, is, no, generally, accepted, reconstruction, of, proto, afroasiatic, grammar, syntax, or, morphology, nor, one, for, any, of, the, sub, branches, besides, egyptian, this, means, that, it, is, difficult, to, know, which, features, in, afroasiatic, languages, are, retentions, and, which, are, innovations, moreover, all, afroasiatic, languages, have, long, been, in, contact, with, other, language, families, and, with, each, other, leading, to, the, possibility, of, widespread, borrowing, both, within, afroasiatic, and, from, unrelated, languages, there, are, nevertheless, a, number, of, commonly, observed, features, in, afroasiatic, morphology, and, derivation, including, the, use, of, suffixes, infixes, vowel, lengthening, and, shortening, as, a, morphological, change, as, well, as, the, use, of, tone, changes, to, indicate, morphology, further, commonalities, and, differences, are, explored, in, more, detail, below, a, widely, attested, feature, in, aa, languages, is, a, consonantal, structure, into, which, various, vocalic, templates, are, placed, this, structure, is, particularly, visible, in, the, verbs, and, is, particularly, noticeable, in, semitic, besides, for, semitic, vocalic, templates, are, well, attested, for, cushitic, and, berber, where, along, with, chadic, it, is, less, productive, it, is, absent, in, omotic, for, egyptian, evidence, for, the, root, and, template, structure, exists, from, coptic, in, semitic, egyptian, berber, verbs, have, no, inherent, vowels, at, all, the, vowels, found, in, a, given, stem, are, dependent, on, the, vocalic, template, in, chadic, verb, stems, can, include, an, inherent, vowel, as, well, most, semitic, verbs, are, triliteral, have, three, consonants, whereas, most, chadic, omotic, and, cushitic, verbs, are, biliteral, having, two, consonants, the, degree, to, which, the, proto, aa, verbal, root, was, triliteral, is, debated, it, may, have, originally, been, mostly, biconsonantal, to, which, various, affixes, such, as, verbal, extensions, were, then, added, and, lexicalized, although, any, root, could, theoretically, be, used, to, create, a, noun, or, a, verb, there, is, evidence, for, the, existence, of, distinct, noun, and, verb, roots, which, behave, in, different, ways, as, part, of, these, templates, the, alternation, apophony, between, high, vowels, e, g, i, u, and, a, low, vowel, a, in, verbal, forms, is, usually, described, as, one, of, the, main, characteristics, of, aa, languages, this, change, codes, a, variety, of, different, functions, it, is, unclear, whether, this, system, is, a, common, aa, trait, the, chadic, examples, for, instance, show, signs, of, originally, deriving, from, affixes, which, could, explain, the, origins, of, the, alterations, in, other, languages, as, well, it, remains, unclear, what, word, order, proto, afroasiatic, had, berber, egyptian, and, most, semitic, languages, are, verb, initial, languages, whereas, cushitic, omotic, and, some, semitic, subgroups, are, verb, final, languages, proto, chadic, is, reconstructed, as, having, verb, initial, word, order, but, most, chadic, languages, have, subject, verb, object, word, order, afroasiatic, languages, use, the, processes, of, reduplication, and, gemination, which, often, overlap, in, meaning, to, derive, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and, adverbs, throughout, the, aa, language, family, gemination, in, particular, is, one, of, the, typical, features, of, aa, full, or, partial, reduplication, of, the, verb, is, often, used, to, derive, forms, showing, repeated, action, pluractionality, though, it, is, unclear, if, this, is, an, inherited, feature, or, has, been, widely, borrowed, the, assignment, of, nouns, and, pronouns, to, either, masculine, or, feminine, gender, is, present, in, all, branches, but, not, all, languages, of, the, afroasiatic, family, this, sex, based, gender, system, is, widely, agreed, to, derive, from, proto, afroasiatic, in, most, branches, gender, is, an, inherent, property, of, nouns, additionally, even, when, nouns, are, not, cognates, they, tend, to, have, the, same, gender, throughout, afroasiatic, gender, stability, in, egyptian, semitic, and, berber, a, feminine, suffix, t, is, attested, to, mark, feminine, nouns, in, some, cushitic, and, chadic, languages, a, feminine, t, suffix, or, prefix, lexicalized, from, a, demonstrative, is, used, to, mark, definiteness, in, addition, to, these, uses, t, also, functions, as, a, diminutive, pejorative, and, or, singulative, marker, in, some, languages, afroasiatic, languages, have, a, variety, of, ways, of, marking, plurals, in, some, branches, nouns, change, gender, from, singular, to, plural, gender, polarity, while, in, others, plural, forms, are, ungendered, in, addition, to, marking, plurals, via, a, number, of, affixes, with, the, suffixes, uu, w, and, n, a, widely, attested, several, aa, languages, make, use, of, internal, vowel, change, apophony, and, or, insertion, epenthesis, these, so, called, internal, a, or, broken, plurals, are, securely, attested, in, semitic, berber, cushitic, and, chadic, although, it, is, unclear, if, the, chadic, examples, are, an, independent, development, another, common, method, of, forming, plurals, is, reduplication, nouns, cases, are, found, in, the, semitic, berber, cushitic, and, omotic, branches, they, are, not, found, in, chadic, languages, and, there, is, no, evidence, for, cases, in, egyptian, a, common, pattern, in, aa, languages, with, case, is, for, the, nominative, to, be, marked, by, u, or, i, and, the, accusative, to, be, marked, by, a, however, the, number, and, types, of, cases, varies, across, aa, and, also, within, the, individual, branches, some, languages, in, aa, have, a, marked, nominative, alignment, a, feature, which, may, date, back, to, proto, afroasiatic, zygmont, frajzyngier, states, that, a, general, characteristic, of, case, marking, in, aa, languages, is, that, it, tends, to, mark, roles, such, as, genitive, dative, locative, etc, rather, than, the, subject, and, object, a, second, category, which, partially, overlaps, with, case, is, the, aa, linguistic, category, of, state, linguists, use, the, term, state, to, refer, to, different, things, in, different, languages, in, cushitic, and, semitic, nouns, exist, in, the, free, state, or, the, construct, state, the, construct, state, is, a, special, usually, reduced, form, of, a, noun, which, is, used, when, the, noun, is, possessed, by, another, noun, semitic, or, is, modified, by, an, adjective, or, relative, clause, cushitic, edward, lipi, ski, refers, to, semitic, nouns, as, having, four, states, absolute, free, indeterminate, construct, determinate, and, predicate, coptic, and, egyptian, grammar, also, refers, to, nouns, having, a, free, absolute, state, a, construct, state, and, a, pronominal, state, the, construct, state, is, used, when, a, noun, becomes, unstressed, as, the, first, element, of, a, compound, whereas, the, pronominal, state, is, used, when, the, noun, has, a, suffixed, possessive, pronoun, berber, instead, contrasts, between, the, free, state, and, the, annexed, state, the, latter, of, which, is, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, including, for, subjects, placed, after, a, verb, and, after, certain, prepositions, there, is, no, strict, distinction, between, adjectives, nouns, and, adverbs, in, afroasiatic, all, branches, of, afroasiatic, have, a, lexical, category, of, adjectives, except, for, chadic, some, chadic, languages, do, have, adjectives, however, in, berber, languages, adjectives, are, rare, and, are, mostly, replaced, by, nouns, of, quality, and, stative, verbs, in, different, languages, adjectives, and, other, modifiers, must, either, precede, or, follow, the, noun, in, most, aa, languages, numerals, precede, the, noun, in, those, languages, that, have, adjectives, they, can, take, gender, and, number, markings, which, in, some, cases, agree, with, the, gender, and, number, of, the, noun, they, are, modifying, however, in, omotic, adjectives, do, not, agree, with, nouns, sometimes, they, only, take, gender, and, number, marking, when, they, are, used, as, nouns, in, other, cases, they, take, gender, and, number, marking, only, when, they, follow, the, noun, the, noun, then, receives, no, marking, a, widespread, pattern, of, gender, and, number, marking, in, afroasiatic, found, on, demonstratives, articles, adjectives, and, relative, markers, is, a, consonant, n, for, masculine, t, for, feminine, and, n, for, plural, this, can, be, found, in, semitic, egyptian, beja, berber, and, chadic, a, system, k, masculine, t, feminine, and, h, plural, can, be, found, in, cushitic, chadic, with, masculine, k, also, appearing, in, omotic, the, feminine, marker, t, is, one, of, the, most, consistent, aspects, across, the, different, branches, of, aa, there, is, no, agreement, about, which, tenses, aspects, or, moods, tams, proto, afroasiatic, might, have, had, most, grammars, of, aa, posit, a, distinction, between, perfective, and, imperfective, verbal, aspects, which, can, be, found, in, cushitic, berber, semitic, most, chadic, languages, and, some, omotic, languages, the, egyptian, verbal, system, diverges, greatly, from, that, found, in, the, other, branches, additionally, it, is, common, in, afroasiatic, languages, for, the, present, imperfective, form, to, be, a, derived, marked, form, of, the, verb, whereas, in, most, other, languages, and, language, families, the, present, tense, is, the, default, form, of, the, verb, another, common, trait, across, the, family, is, the, use, of, a, suppletive, imperative, for, verbs, of, motion, conjugation, of, verbs, using, prefixes, that, mark, person, number, and, gender, can, be, found, in, semitic, berber, and, in, cushitic, where, it, is, only, found, on, a, small, set, of, frequent, verbs, these, prefixes, are, clearly, cognate, across, the, branches, although, their, use, within, the, verbal, systems, of, the, individual, languages, varies, there, is, a, general, pattern, in, which, n, is, used, for, the, first, person, plural, whereas, t, is, used, for, all, forms, of, the, second, person, regardless, of, plurality, or, gender, as, well, as, feminine, singular, prefixes, of, glottal, stop, for, the, first, person, singular, and, y, for, the, third, person, masculine, can, also, be, reconstructed, as, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, prefix, conjugation, in, omotic, chadic, or, egyptian, it, is, unclear, whether, this, was, a, proto, afroasiatic, feature, that, has, been, lost, in, those, branches, or, is, a, shared, innovation, among, semitic, berber, and, cushitic, some, aa, branches, have, what, is, called, a, suffix, conjugation, formed, by, adding, pronominal, suffixes, to, indicate, person, gender, and, number, to, a, verbal, adjective, in, akkadian, egyptian, berber, and, cushitic, this, forms, a, stative, conjugation, used, to, express, the, state, or, result, of, an, action, the, same, endings, as, in, akkadian, and, egyptian, are, also, present, in, the, west, semitic, perfective, verb, form, in, akkadian, and, egyptian, the, suffixes, appear, to, be, reduced, forms, of, the, independent, pronouns, see, pronouns, the, obvious, correspondence, between, the, endings, in, the, two, branches, has, been, argued, to, show, that, egyptian, and, semitic, are, closely, related, while, some, scholars, posit, an, aa, origin, for, this, form, it, is, possible, that, the, berber, and, cushitic, forms, are, independent, developments, as, they, show, significant, differences, from, the, egyptian, and, semitic, forms, the, cushitic, forms, in, particular, may, be, derived, from, morphology, found, in, subordinate, clauses, a, prefix, in, m, is, the, most, widely, attested, affix, in, aa, that, is, used, to, derive, nouns, and, is, one, of, the, features, joseph, greenberg, used, to, diagnose, membership, in, the, family, it, forms, agent, nouns, place, nouns, and, instrument, nouns, in, some, branches, it, can, also, derive, abstract, nouns, and, participles, omotic, meanwhile, shows, evidence, for, a, non, productive, prefix, mv, associated, with, the, feminine, gender, christopher, ehret, has, argued, that, this, prefix, is, a, later, development, that, was, not, present, in, proto, afro, asiatic, but, rather, derived, from, a, paa, indefinite, pronoun, m, such, an, etymology, is, rejected, by, a, zaborski, and, g, bor, tak, cs, the, latter, of, whom, argues, for, a, paa, ma, that, unites, all, or, some, of, the, meanings, in, the, modern, languages, many, aa, languages, use, prefixes, or, suffixes, verbal, extensions, to, encode, various, pieces, of, information, about, the, verb, three, derivational, prefixes, can, be, reconstructed, for, proto, afroasiatic, s, causative, t, middle, voice, or, reflexive, and, n, passive, the, prefixes, appear, with, various, related, meanings, in, the, individual, daughter, languages, and, branches, christopher, ehret, has, proposed, that, proto, afroasiatic, originally, had, as, many, as, thirty, seven, separate, verbal, extensions, many, of, which, then, became, fossilized, as, third, consonants, this, theory, has, been, criticized, by, some, such, as, andrzej, zaborski, and, alan, kaye, as, being, too, many, extensions, to, be, realistic, though, zygmont, frajzyngier, and, erin, shay, note, that, some, chadic, languages, have, as, many, as, twelve, extensions, the, so, called, nisba, is, a, suffix, used, to, derive, adjectives, from, nouns, and, in, egyptian, also, from, prepositions, it, is, found, in, egyptian, semitic, and, possibly, in, some, relic, forms, berber, the, suffix, has, the, same, basic, form, in, egyptian, and, semitic, taking, the, form, i, y, in, semitic, and, being, written, j, in, egyptian, the, semitic, and, cushitic, genitive, case, in, i, ii, may, be, related, to, nisba, adjective, derivation, due, to, its, presence, in, the, oldest, attested, and, best, known, aa, branches, nisba, derivation, is, often, thought, of, as, a, quintessentially, afroasiatic, feature, christopher, ehret, argues, for, its, presence, in, proto, afroasiatic, and, for, its, attestation, in, some, form, in, all, branches, with, a, shape, ay, in, addition, to, iy, in, some, cases, the, forms, of, the, pronouns, are, very, stable, throughout, afroasiatic, excluding, omotic, and, they, have, been, used, as, one, of, the, chief, tools, for, determining, whether, a, language, belongs, to, the, family, however, there, is, no, consensus, on, what, the, reconstructed, set, of, afroasiatic, pronouns, might, have, looked, like, a, common, characteristic, of, aa, languages, is, the, existence, of, a, special, set, of, independent, pronouns, which, are, distinct, from, subject, pronouns, they, can, occur, together, with, subject, pronouns, but, cannot, fulfill, an, object, function, also, common, are, dependent, affix, pronouns, used, for, direct, objects, and, to, mark, possession, for, most, branches, the, first, person, pronouns, contain, a, nasal, consonant, n, m, whereas, the, third, person, displays, a, sibilant, consonant, s, sh, other, commonalities, are, masculine, and, feminine, forms, used, in, both, the, second, and, third, persons, except, in, cushitic, and, omotic, these, pronouns, tend, to, show, a, masculine, u, and, a, feminine, i, the, omotic, forms, of, the, personal, pronouns, differ, from, the, others, with, only, the, plural, forms, in, north, omotic, appearing, potentially, to, be, cognate, unlike, in, the, indo, european, or, austronesian, language, families, numerals, in, aa, languages, cannot, be, traced, to, a, proto, system, the, cushitic, and, chadic, numeral, systems, appear, to, have, originally, been, base, 5, the, system, in, berber, egyptian, and, semitic, however, has, independent, words, for, the, numbers, 6, 9, thus, it, is, possible, that, the, numerals, in, egyptian, berber, and, semitic, are, more, closely, related, whereas, the, cushitic, and, chadic, numerals, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, modern, chadic, numeral, systems, are, sometimes, decimal, having, separate, names, for, the, numbers, 1, 10, and, sometimes, base, 5, deriving, the, numbers, 6, 9, from, the, numbers, 1, 5, in, some, way, some, families, show, more, than, one, word, for, a, numeral, chadic, semitic, and, berber, each, have, two, words, for, two, and, semitic, has, four, words, for, one, andrzej, zaborski, further, notes, that, the, numbers, one, two, and, five, are, particularly, susceptible, to, replacement, by, new, words, with, five, often, based, on, a, word, meaning, hand, another, factor, making, comparisons, of, aa, numeral, systems, difficult, is, the, possibility, of, borrowing, only, some, berber, languages, maintain, the, native, berber, numeral, system, with, many, using, arabic, loans, for, higher, numbers, and, some, from, any, numeral, beyond, two, in, some, berber, languages, the, roots, for, one, and, two, are, also, borrowed, from, arabic, some, south, cushitic, numerals, are, borrowed, from, nilotic, languages, other, cushitic, numerals, have, been, borrowed, from, ethiopian, semitic, languages, afroasiatic, languages, share, a, vocabulary, of, proto, afroasiatic, origin, to, varying, extents, writing, in, 2004, john, huehnergard, notes, the, great, difficulty, in, establishing, cognate, sets, across, the, family, identifying, cognates, is, difficult, because, the, languages, in, question, are, often, separated, by, thousands, of, years, of, development, and, many, languages, within, the, family, have, long, been, in, contact, with, each, other, raising, the, possibility, of, loanwords, work, is, also, hampered, because, of, the, poor, state, of, documentation, of, many, languages, there, are, two, etymological, dictionaries, of, afroasiatic, one, by, christopher, ehret, and, one, by, vladimir, orel, and, olga, stolbova, both, from, 1995, both, works, provide, highly, divergent, reconstructions, and, have, been, heavily, criticized, by, other, scholars, andrzej, zaborski, refers, to, orel, and, stolbova, s, reconstructions, as, controversial, and, ehret, s, as, not, acceptable, to, many, scholars, tom, g, ldemann, argues, that, much, comparative, work, in, afroasiatic, suffers, from, not, attempting, first, to, reconstruct, smaller, units, within, the, individual, branches, but, instead, comparing, words, in, the, individual, languages, nevertheless, both, dictionaries, agree, on, some, items, and, some, proposed, cognates, are, uncontroversial, such, cognates, tend, to, rely, on, relatively, simple, sound, correspondences, possibly, hausa, b, ga, to, hit, strike, hausa, halshe, h, tongue, lashe, to, lick
