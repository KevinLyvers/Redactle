https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity
conformity, is, the, act, of, matching, attitudes, beliefs, and, behaviors, to, group, norms, politics, or, being, like, minded, norms, are, implicit, specific, rules, guidance, shared, by, a, group, of, individuals, that, guide, their, interactions, with, others, people, often, choose, to, conform, to, society, rather, than, to, pursue, personal, desires, because, it, is, often, easier, to, follow, the, path, others, have, made, already, rather, than, forging, a, new, one, thus, conformity, is, sometimes, a, product, of, group, communication, this, tendency, to, conform, occurs, in, small, groups, and, or, in, society, as, a, whole, and, may, result, from, subtle, unconscious, influences, predisposed, state, of, mind, or, from, direct, and, overt, social, pressure, conformity, can, occur, in, the, presence, of, others, or, when, an, individual, is, alone, for, example, people, tend, to, follow, social, norms, when, eating, or, when, watching, television, even, if, alone, the, asch, conformity, experiment, demonstrates, how, much, influence, conformity, has, on, people, in, a, laboratory, experiment, asch, asked, 50, male, students, from, swarthmore, college, in, the, us, to, participate, in, a, vision, test, asch, put, a, naive, participant, in, a, room, with, seven, confederates, stooges, in, a, line, judgment, task, when, confronted, with, the, line, task, each, confederate, had, already, decided, what, response, they, would, give, the, real, members, of, the, experimental, group, sat, in, the, last, position, while, the, others, were, pre, arranged, experimenters, who, gave, apparently, incorrect, answers, in, unison, asch, recorded, the, last, person, s, answer, to, analyze, the, influence, of, conformity, surprisingly, about, one, third, 32, of, the, participants, who, were, placed, in, this, situation, sided, with, the, clearly, incorrect, majority, on, the, critical, trials, over, the, 12, critical, trials, about, 75, of, participants, conformed, at, least, once, after, being, interviewed, subjects, acknowledged, that, they, did, not, actually, agree, with, the, answers, given, by, others, the, majority, of, them, however, believe, that, groups, are, wiser, or, do, not, want, to, appear, as, mavericks, and, choose, to, repeat, the, same, obvious, misconception, it, is, clear, from, this, that, conformity, has, a, powerful, effect, on, human, perception, and, behavior, even, to, the, extent, that, it, can, be, faked, against, a, person, s, basic, belief, system, changing, one, s, behaviors, to, match, the, responses, of, others, which, is, conformity, can, be, conscious, or, not, people, have, an, intrinsic, tendency, to, unconsciously, imitate, other, s, behaviors, such, as, gesture, language, talking, speed, and, other, actions, of, the, people, they, interact, with, there, are, two, other, main, reasons, for, conformity, informational, influence, and, normative, influence, people, display, conformity, in, response, to, informational, influence, when, they, believe, the, group, is, better, informed, or, in, response, to, normative, influence, when, they, are, afraid, of, rejection, when, the, advocated, norm, could, be, correct, the, informational, influence, is, more, important, than, the, normative, influence, while, otherwise, the, normative, influence, dominates, people, often, conform, from, a, desire, for, security, within, a, group, also, known, as, normative, influence, typically, a, group, of, a, similar, age, culture, religion, or, educational, status, this, is, often, referred, to, as, groupthink, a, pattern, of, thought, characterized, by, self, deception, forced, manufacture, of, consent, and, conformity, to, group, values, and, ethics, which, ignores, realistic, appraisal, of, other, courses, of, action, unwillingness, to, conform, carries, the, risk, of, social, rejection, conformity, is, often, associated, in, media, with, adolescence, and, youth, culture, but, strongly, affects, humans, of, all, ages, although, peer, pressure, may, manifest, negatively, conformity, can, be, regarded, as, either, good, or, bad, driving, on, the, conventionally, approved, side, of, the, road, may, be, seen, as, beneficial, conformity, with, the, appropriate, environmental, influence, conforming, in, early, childhood, years, allows, one, to, learn, and, thus, adopt, the, appropriate, behaviors, necessary, to, interact, and, develop, correctly, within, one, s, society, conformity, influences, the, formation, and, maintenance, of, social, norms, and, helps, societies, function, smoothly, and, predictably, via, the, self, elimination, of, behaviors, seen, as, contrary, to, unwritten, rules, conformity, was, found, to, impair, group, performance, in, a, variable, environment, but, was, not, found, to, have, a, significant, effect, on, performance, in, a, stable, environment, according, to, herbert, kelman, there, are, three, types, of, conformity, 1, compliance, which, is, public, conformity, and, it, is, motivated, by, the, need, for, approval, or, the, fear, of, disapproval, 2, identification, which, is, a, deeper, type, of, conformism, than, compliance, 3, internalization, which, is, to, conform, both, publicly, and, privately, major, factors, that, influence, the, degree, of, conformity, include, culture, gender, age, size, of, the, group, situational, factors, and, different, stimuli, in, some, cases, minority, influence, a, special, case, of, informational, influence, can, resist, the, pressure, to, conform, and, influence, the, majority, to, accept, the, minority, s, belief, or, behaviors, conformity, is, the, tendency, to, change, our, perceptions, opinions, or, behaviors, in, ways, that, are, consistent, with, group, norms, norms, are, implicit, specific, rules, shared, by, a, group, of, individuals, on, how, they, should, behave, people, may, be, susceptible, to, conform, to, group, norms, because, they, want, to, gain, acceptance, from, their, group, some, adolescents, gain, acceptance, and, recognition, from, their, peers, by, conformity, this, peer, moderated, conformity, increases, from, the, transition, of, childhood, to, adolescence, it, follows, a, u, shaped, age, pattern, wherein, conformity, increases, through, childhood, peaking, at, sixth, and, ninth, grades, and, then, declines, adolescents, often, follow, the, logic, that, if, everyone, else, is, doing, it, then, it, must, be, good, and, right, however, it, is, found, that, they, are, more, likely, to, conform, if, peer, pressure, involves, neutral, activities, such, as, those, in, sports, entertainment, and, prosocial, behaviors, rather, than, anti, social, behaviors, researchers, have, found, that, peer, conformity, is, strongest, for, individuals, who, reported, strong, identification, with, their, friends, or, groups, making, them, more, likely, to, adopt, beliefs, and, behaviors, accepted, in, such, circles, there, is, also, the, factor, that, the, mere, presence, of, a, person, can, influence, whether, one, is, conforming, or, not, norman, triplett, 1898, was, the, researcher, that, initially, discovered, the, impact, that, mere, presence, has, especially, among, peers, in, other, words, all, people, can, affect, society, we, are, influenced, by, people, doing, things, beside, us, whether, this, is, in, a, competitive, atmosphere, or, not, people, tend, to, be, influenced, by, those, who, are, their, own, age, especially, co, actors, that, are, similar, to, us, tend, to, push, us, more, than, those, who, are, not, according, to, donelson, forsyth, after, submitting, to, group, pressures, individuals, may, find, themselves, facing, one, of, several, responses, to, conformity, these, types, of, responses, to, conformity, vary, in, their, degree, of, public, agreement, versus, private, agreement, when, an, individual, finds, themselves, in, a, position, where, they, publicly, agree, with, the, group, s, decision, yet, privately, disagrees, with, the, group, s, consensus, they, are, experiencing, compliance, or, acquiescence, this, is, also, referenced, as, apparent, conformity, this, type, of, conformity, recognizes, that, behavior, is, not, always, consistent, with, our, beliefs, and, attitudes, which, mimics, leon, festinger, s, cognitive, dissonance, theory, in, turn, conversion, otherwise, known, as, private, acceptance, or, true, conformity, involves, both, publicly, and, privately, agreeing, with, the, group, s, decision, in, the, case, of, private, acceptance, the, person, conforms, to, the, group, by, changing, their, beliefs, and, attitudes, thus, this, represents, a, true, change, of, opinion, to, match, the, majority, another, type, of, social, response, which, does, not, involve, conformity, with, the, majority, of, the, group, is, called, convergence, in, this, type, of, social, response, the, group, member, agrees, with, the, group, s, decision, from, the, outset, and, thus, does, not, need, to, shift, their, opinion, on, the, matter, at, hand, in, addition, forsyth, shows, that, nonconformity, can, also, fall, into, one, of, two, response, categories, firstly, an, individual, who, does, not, conform, to, the, majority, can, display, independence, independence, or, dissent, can, be, defined, as, the, unwillingness, to, bend, to, group, pressures, thus, this, individual, stays, true, to, his, or, her, personal, standards, instead, of, the, swaying, toward, group, standards, secondly, a, nonconformist, could, be, displaying, anticonformity, or, counterconformity, which, involves, the, taking, of, opinions, that, are, opposite, to, what, the, group, believes, this, type, of, nonconformity, can, be, motivated, by, a, need, to, rebel, against, the, status, quo, instead, of, the, need, to, be, accurate, in, one, s, opinion, to, conclude, social, responses, to, conformity, can, be, seen, to, vary, along, a, continuum, from, conversion, to, anticonformity, for, example, a, popular, experiment, in, conformity, research, known, as, the, asch, situation, or, asch, conformity, experiments, primarily, includes, compliance, and, independence, also, other, responses, to, conformity, can, be, identified, in, groups, such, as, juries, sports, teams, and, work, teams, muzafer, sherif, was, interested, in, knowing, how, many, people, would, change, their, opinions, to, bring, them, in, line, with, the, opinion, of, a, group, in, his, experiment, participants, were, placed, in, a, dark, room, and, asked, to, stare, at, a, small, dot, of, light, 15, feet, away, they, were, then, asked, to, estimate, the, amount, it, moved, the, trick, was, there, was, no, movement, it, was, caused, by, a, visual, illusion, known, as, the, autokinetic, effect, the, participants, stated, estimates, ranging, from, 1, 10, inches, on, the, first, day, each, person, perceived, different, amounts, of, movement, but, from, the, second, to, the, fourth, day, the, same, estimate, was, agreed, on, and, others, conformed, to, it, over, time, the, personal, estimates, converged, with, the, other, group, members, estimates, once, discussing, their, judgments, aloud, sherif, suggested, this, was, a, simulation, for, how, social, norms, develop, in, a, society, providing, a, common, frame, of, reference, for, people, his, findings, emphasize, that, people, rely, on, others, to, interpret, ambiguous, stimuli, and, new, situations, subsequent, experiments, were, based, on, more, realistic, situations, in, an, eyewitness, identification, task, participants, were, shown, a, suspect, individually, and, then, in, a, lineup, of, other, suspects, they, were, given, one, second, to, identify, him, making, it, a, difficult, task, one, group, was, told, that, their, input, was, very, important, and, would, be, used, by, the, legal, community, to, the, other, it, was, simply, a, trial, being, more, motivated, to, get, the, right, answer, increased, the, tendency, to, conform, those, who, wanted, to, be, more, accurate, conformed, 51, of, the, time, as, opposed, to, 35, in, the, other, group, sherif, s, study, provided, a, framework, for, subsequent, studies, of, influence, such, as, solomon, asch, s, 1955, study, solomon, e, asch, conducted, a, modification, of, sherif, s, study, assuming, that, when, the, situation, was, very, clear, conformity, would, be, drastically, reduced, he, exposed, people, in, a, group, to, a, series, of, lines, and, the, participants, were, asked, to, match, one, line, with, a, standard, line, all, participants, except, one, were, accomplices, and, gave, the, wrong, answer, in, 12, of, the, 18, trials, the, results, showed, a, surprisingly, high, degree, of, conformity, 74, of, the, participants, conformed, on, at, least, one, trial, on, average, people, conformed, one, third, of, the, time, a, question, is, how, the, group, would, affect, individuals, in, a, situation, where, the, correct, answer, is, less, obvious, after, his, first, test, asch, wanted, to, investigate, whether, the, size, or, unanimity, of, the, majority, had, greater, influence, on, test, subjects, which, aspect, of, the, influence, of, a, majority, is, more, important, the, size, of, the, majority, or, its, unanimity, the, experiment, was, modified, to, examine, this, question, in, one, series, the, size, of, the, opposition, was, varied, from, one, to, 15, persons, the, results, clearly, showed, that, as, more, people, opposed, the, subject, the, subject, became, more, likely, to, conform, however, the, increasing, majority, was, only, influential, up, to, a, point, from, three, or, more, opponents, there, is, more, than, 30, of, conformity, besides, that, this, experiment, proved, that, conformity, is, powerful, but, also, fragile, it, is, powerful, because, just, by, having, actors, giving, the, wrong, answer, made, the, participant, to, also, give, the, wrong, answer, even, though, they, knew, it, was, not, correct, it, is, also, fragile, however, because, in, one, of, the, variants, for, the, experiment, one, of, the, actors, was, supposed, to, give, the, correct, answer, being, an, ally, to, the, participant, with, an, ally, the, participant, was, more, likely, to, give, the, correct, answer, than, he, was, before, the, ally, in, addition, if, the, participant, was, able, to, write, down, the, answer, instead, of, saying, out, loud, he, was, also, more, likely, to, put, the, correct, answer, the, reason, for, that, is, because, he, was, not, afraid, of, being, different, from, the, rest, of, the, group, since, the, answers, were, hidden, this, experiment, was, conducted, by, yale, university, psychologist, stanley, milgram, in, order, to, portray, obedience, to, authority, they, measured, the, willingness, of, participants, men, aged, 20, to, 50, from, a, diverse, range, of, occupations, with, different, levels, of, education, to, obey, the, instructions, from, an, authority, figure, to, supply, fake, electric, shocks, that, would, gradually, increase, to, fatal, levels, regardless, of, these, instructions, going, against, their, personal, conscience, 65, of, the, participants, shocked, all, the, way, to, 450, volts, fully, obeying, the, instruction, even, if, they, did, so, reluctantly, additionally, all, participants, shocked, to, at, least, 300, volts, in, this, experiment, the, subjects, did, not, have, punishments, or, rewards, if, they, chose, to, disobey, or, obey, all, they, might, receive, is, disapproval, or, approval, from, the, experimenter, since, this, is, the, case, they, had, no, motives, to, sway, them, to, perform, the, immoral, orders, or, not, one, of, the, most, important, factors, of, the, experiment, is, the, position, of, the, authority, figure, relative, to, the, subject, the, shocker, along, with, the, position, of, the, learner, the, one, getting, shocked, there, is, a, reduction, in, conformity, depending, on, if, the, authority, figure, or, learner, was, in, the, same, room, as, the, subject, when, the, authority, figure, was, in, another, room, and, only, phoned, to, give, their, orders, the, obedience, rate, went, down, to, 20, 5, when, the, learner, was, in, the, same, room, as, the, subject, the, obedience, rate, dropped, to, 40, this, experiment, led, by, psychology, professor, philip, g, zimbardo, recruited, stanford, students, using, a, local, newspaper, ad, who, he, checked, to, be, both, physically, and, mentally, healthy, subjects, were, either, assigned, the, role, of, a, prisoner, or, guard, at, random, over, an, extended, period, of, time, within, a, pretend, prison, setting, on, the, stanford, university, campus, the, study, was, set, to, be, over, the, course, of, two, weeks, but, it, was, abruptly, cut, short, because, of, the, behaviors, the, subjects, were, exuding, it, was, terminated, due, to, the, guards, taking, on, tyrannical, and, discriminatory, characteristics, while, prisoners, showed, blatant, signs, of, depression, and, distress, in, essence, this, study, showed, us, a, lot, about, conformity, and, power, imbalance, for, one, it, demonstrates, how, situations, determines, the, way, our, behavior, is, shaped, and, predominates, over, our, personality, attitudes, and, individual, morals, those, chosen, to, be, guards, were, not, mean, spirited, but, the, situation, they, were, put, in, made, them, act, accordingly, to, their, role, furthermore, this, study, elucidates, the, idea, that, humans, conform, to, expected, roles, good, people, i, e, the, guards, before, the, experiment, were, transformed, into, perpetrators, of, evil, healthy, people, i, e, the, prisoners, before, the, experiment, were, subject, to, pathological, reactions, these, aspects, are, also, traceable, to, situational, forces, this, experiment, also, demonstrated, the, notion, of, the, banality, of, evil, which, explains, that, evil, is, not, something, special, or, rare, but, it, is, something, that, exists, in, all, ordinary, people, harvard, psychologist, herbert, kelman, identified, three, major, types, of, conformity, although, kelman, s, distinction, has, been, influential, research, in, social, psychology, has, focused, primarily, on, two, varieties, of, conformity, these, are, informational, conformity, or, informational, social, influence, and, normative, conformity, also, called, normative, social, influence, in, kelman, s, terminology, these, correspond, to, internalization, and, compliance, respectively, there, are, naturally, more, than, two, or, three, variables, in, society, influential, on, human, psychology, and, conformity, the, notion, of, varieties, of, conformity, based, upon, social, influence, is, ambiguous, and, indefinable, in, this, context, according, to, deutsch, and, g, rard, 1955, conformity, results, from, a, motivational, conflict, between, the, fear, of, being, socially, rejected, and, the, wish, to, say, what, we, think, is, correct, that, leads, to, normative, influence, and, a, cognitive, conflict, others, create, doubts, in, what, we, think, which, leads, to, informational, influence, informational, social, influence, occurs, when, one, turns, to, the, members, of, one, s, group, to, obtain, and, accept, accurate, information, about, reality, a, person, is, most, likely, to, use, informational, social, influence, in, certain, situations, when, a, situation, is, ambiguous, people, become, uncertain, about, what, to, do, and, they, are, more, likely, to, depend, on, others, for, the, answer, and, during, a, crisis, when, immediate, action, is, necessary, in, spite, of, panic, looking, to, other, people, can, help, ease, fears, but, unfortunately, they, are, not, always, right, the, more, knowledgeable, a, person, is, the, more, valuable, they, are, as, a, resource, thus, people, often, turn, to, experts, for, help, but, once, again, people, must, be, careful, as, experts, can, make, mistakes, too, informational, social, influence, often, results, in, internalization, or, private, acceptance, where, a, person, genuinely, believes, that, the, information, is, right, normative, social, influence, occurs, when, one, conforms, to, be, liked, or, accepted, by, the, members, of, the, group, this, need, of, social, approval, and, acceptance, is, part, of, our, state, of, humans, in, addition, to, this, we, know, that, when, people, do, not, conform, with, their, group, and, therefore, are, deviants, they, are, less, liked, and, even, punished, by, the, group, normative, influence, usually, results, in, public, compliance, doing, or, saying, something, without, believing, in, it, the, experiment, of, asch, in, 1951, is, one, example, of, normative, influence, even, though, john, turner, et, al, argued, that, the, post, experimental, interviews, showed, that, the, respondents, were, uncertain, about, the, correct, answers, in, some, cases, the, answers, might, have, been, evident, to, the, experimenters, but, the, participants, did, not, have, the, same, experience, subsequent, studies, pointed, out, the, fact, that, the, participants, were, not, known, to, each, other, and, therefore, did, not, pose, a, threat, against, social, rejection, see, normative, influence, vs, referent, informational, influence, in, a, reinterpretation, of, the, original, data, from, these, experiments, hodges, and, geyer, 2006, found, that, asch, s, subjects, were, not, so, conformist, after, all, the, experiments, provide, powerful, evidence, for, people, s, tendency, to, tell, the, truth, even, when, others, do, not, they, also, provide, compelling, evidence, of, people, s, concern, for, others, and, their, views, by, closely, examining, the, situation, in, which, asch, s, subjects, find, themselves, they, find, that, the, situation, places, multiple, demands, on, participants, they, include, truth, i, e, expressing, one, s, own, view, accurately, trust, i, e, taking, seriously, the, value, of, others, claims, and, social, solidarity, i, e, a, commitment, to, integrate, the, views, of, self, and, others, without, deprecating, in, addition, to, these, epistemic, values, there, are, multiple, moral, claims, as, well, these, include, the, need, for, participants, to, care, for, the, integrity, and, well, being, of, other, participants, the, experimenter, themselves, and, the, worth, of, scientific, research, deutsch, g, rard, 1955, designed, different, situations, that, variated, from, asch, experiment, and, found, that, when, participants, were, writing, their, answer, privately, they, were, giving, the, correct, one, normative, influence, a, function, of, social, impact, theory, has, three, components, the, number, of, people, in, the, group, has, a, surprising, effect, as, the, number, increases, each, person, has, less, of, an, impact, a, group, s, strength, is, how, important, the, group, is, to, a, person, groups, we, value, generally, have, more, social, influence, immediacy, is, how, close, the, group, is, in, time, and, space, when, the, influence, is, taking, place, psychologists, have, constructed, a, mathematical, model, using, these, three, factors, and, are, able, to, predict, the, amount, of, conformity, that, occurs, with, some, degree, of, accuracy, baron, and, his, colleagues, conducted, a, second, eyewitness, study, that, focused, on, normative, influence, in, this, version, the, task, was, easier, each, participant, had, five, seconds, to, look, at, a, slide, instead, of, just, one, second, once, again, there, were, both, high, and, low, motives, to, be, accurate, but, the, results, were, the, reverse, of, the, first, study, the, low, motivation, group, conformed, 33, of, the, time, similar, to, asch, s, findings, the, high, motivation, group, conformed, less, at, 16, these, results, show, that, when, accuracy, is, not, very, important, it, is, better, to, get, the, wrong, answer, than, to, risk, social, disapproval, an, experiment, using, procedures, similar, to, asch, s, found, that, there, was, significantly, less, conformity, in, six, person, groups, of, friends, as, compared, to, six, person, groups, of, strangers, because, friends, already, know, and, accept, each, other, there, may, be, less, normative, pressure, to, conform, in, some, situations, field, studies, on, cigarette, and, alcohol, abuse, however, generally, demonstrate, evidence, of, friends, exerting, normative, social, influence, on, each, other, although, conformity, generally, leads, individuals, to, think, and, act, more, like, groups, individuals, are, occasionally, able, to, reverse, this, tendency, and, change, the, people, around, them, this, is, known, as, minority, influence, a, special, case, of, informational, influence, minority, influence, is, most, likely, when, people, can, make, a, clear, and, consistent, case, for, their, point, of, view, if, the, minority, fluctuates, and, shows, uncertainty, the, chance, of, influence, is, small, however, a, minority, that, makes, a, strong, convincing, case, increases, the, probability, of, changing, the, majority, s, beliefs, and, behaviors, minority, members, who, are, perceived, as, experts, are, high, in, status, or, have, benefited, the, group, in, the, past, are, also, more, likely, to, succeed, another, form, of, minority, influence, can, sometimes, override, conformity, effects, and, lead, to, unhealthy, group, dynamics, a, 2007, review, of, two, dozen, studies, by, the, university, of, washington, found, that, a, single, bad, apple, an, inconsiderate, or, negligent, group, member, can, substantially, increase, conflicts, and, reduce, performance, in, work, groups, bad, apples, often, create, a, negative, emotional, climate, that, interferes, with, healthy, group, functioning, they, can, be, avoided, by, careful, selection, procedures, and, managed, by, reassigning, them, to, positions, that, require, less, social, interaction, stanley, milgram, found, that, individuals, in, norway, from, a, collectivistic, culture, exhibited, a, higher, degree, of, conformity, than, individuals, in, france, from, an, individualistic, culture, similarly, berry, studied, two, different, populations, the, temne, collectivists, and, the, inuit, individualists, and, found, that, the, temne, conformed, more, than, the, inuit, when, exposed, to, a, conformity, task, bond, and, smith, compared, 134, studies, in, a, meta, analysis, and, found, that, there, is, a, positive, correlation, between, a, country, s, level, of, collectivistic, values, and, conformity, rates, in, the, asch, paradigm, bond, and, smith, also, reported, that, conformity, has, declined, in, the, united, states, over, time, influenced, by, the, writings, of, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, western, travelers, scholars, or, diplomats, who, visited, japan, such, as, basil, hall, chamberlain, george, trumbull, ladd, and, percival, lowell, as, well, as, by, ruth, benedict, s, influential, book, the, chrysanthemum, and, the, sword, many, scholars, of, japanese, studies, speculated, that, there, would, be, a, higher, propensity, to, conform, in, japanese, culture, than, in, american, culture, however, this, view, was, not, formed, on, the, basis, of, empirical, evidence, collected, in, a, systematic, way, but, rather, on, the, basis, of, anecdotes, and, casual, observations, which, are, subject, to, a, variety, of, cognitive, biases, modern, scientific, studies, comparing, conformity, in, japan, and, the, united, states, show, that, americans, conform, in, general, as, much, as, the, japanese, and, in, some, situations, even, more, psychology, professor, yohtaro, takano, from, the, university, of, tokyo, along, with, eiko, osaka, reviewed, four, behavioral, studies, and, found, that, the, rate, of, conformity, errors, that, the, japanese, subjects, manifested, in, the, asch, paradigm, was, similar, with, that, manifested, by, americans, the, study, published, in, 1970, by, robert, frager, from, the, university, of, california, santa, cruz, found, that, the, percentage, of, conformity, errors, within, the, asch, paradigm, was, significantly, lower, in, japan, than, in, the, united, states, especially, in, the, prize, condition, another, study, published, in, 2008, which, compared, the, level, of, conformity, among, japanese, in, groups, peers, from, the, same, college, clubs, with, that, found, among, americans, found, no, substantial, difference, in, the, level, of, conformity, manifested, by, the, two, nations, even, in, the, case, of, in, groups, societal, norms, often, establish, gender, differences, and, researchers, have, reported, differences, in, the, way, men, and, women, conform, to, social, influence, for, example, alice, eagly, and, linda, carli, performed, a, meta, analysis, of, 148, studies, of, influenceability, they, found, that, women, are, more, persuadable, and, more, conforming, than, men, in, group, pressure, situations, that, involve, surveillance, eagly, has, proposed, that, this, sex, difference, may, be, due, to, different, sex, roles, in, society, women, are, generally, taught, to, be, more, agreeable, whereas, men, are, taught, to, be, more, independent, the, composition, of, the, group, plays, a, role, in, conformity, as, well, in, a, study, by, reitan, and, shaw, it, was, found, that, men, and, women, conformed, more, when, there, were, participants, of, both, sexes, involved, versus, participants, of, the, same, sex, subjects, in, the, groups, with, both, sexes, were, more, apprehensive, when, there, was, a, discrepancy, amongst, group, members, and, thus, the, subjects, reported, that, they, doubted, their, own, judgments, sistrunk, and, mcdavid, made, the, argument, that, women, conformed, more, because, of, a, methodological, bias, they, argued, that, because, stereotypes, used, in, studies, are, generally, male, ones, sports, cars, more, than, female, ones, cooking, fashion, women, are, feeling, uncertain, and, conformed, more, which, was, confirmed, by, their, results, research, has, noted, age, differences, in, conformity, for, example, research, with, australian, children, and, adolescents, ages, 3, to, 17, discovered, that, conformity, decreases, with, age, another, study, examined, individuals, that, were, ranged, from, ages, 18, to, 91, the, results, revealed, a, similar, trend, older, participants, displayed, less, conformity, when, compared, to, younger, participants, in, the, same, way, that, gender, has, been, viewed, as, corresponding, to, status, age, has, also, been, argued, to, have, status, implications, berger, rosenholtz, and, zelditch, suggest, that, age, as, a, status, role, can, be, observed, among, college, students, younger, students, such, as, those, in, their, first, year, in, college, are, treated, as, lower, status, individuals, and, older, college, students, are, treated, as, higher, status, individuals, therefore, given, these, status, roles, it, would, be, expected, that, younger, individuals, low, status, conform, to, the, majority, whereas, older, individuals, high, status, would, be, expected, not, to, conform, researchers, have, also, reported, an, interaction, of, gender, and, age, on, conformity, eagly, and, chrvala, examined, the, role, of, age, under, 19, years, vs, 19, years, and, older, gender, and, surveillance, anticipating, responses, to, be, shared, with, group, members, vs, not, anticipating, responses, being, shared, on, conformity, to, group, opinions, they, discovered, that, among, participants, that, were, 19, years, or, older, females, conformed, to, group, opinions, more, so, than, males, when, under, surveillance, i, e, anticipated, that, their, responses, would, be, shared, with, group, members, however, there, were, no, gender, differences, in, conformity, among, participants, who, were, under, 19, years, of, age, and, in, surveillance, conditions, there, were, also, no, gender, differences, when, participants, were, not, under, surveillance, in, a, subsequent, research, article, eagly, suggests, that, women, are, more, likely, to, conform, than, men, because, of, lower, status, roles, of, women, in, society, she, suggests, that, more, submissive, roles, i, e, conforming, are, expected, of, individuals, that, hold, low, status, roles, still, eagly, and, chrvala, s, results, do, conflict, with, previous, research, which, have, found, higher, conformity, levels, among, younger, rather, than, older, individuals, although, conformity, pressures, generally, increase, as, the, size, of, the, majority, increases, asch, s, experiment, in, 1951, stated, that, increasing, the, size, of, the, group, will, have, no, additional, impact, beyond, a, majority, of, size, three, brown, and, byrne, s, 1997, study, described, a, possible, explanation, that, people, may, suspect, collusion, when, the, majority, exceeds, three, or, four, gerard, s, 1968, study, reported, a, linear, relationship, between, the, group, size, and, conformity, when, the, group, size, ranges, from, two, to, seven, people, according, to, latane, s, 1981, study, the, number, of, the, majority, is, one, factor, that, influences, the, degree, of, conformity, and, there, are, other, factors, like, strength, and, immediacy, moreover, a, study, suggests, that, the, effects, of, group, size, depend, on, the, type, of, social, influence, operating, this, means, that, in, situations, where, the, group, is, clearly, wrong, conformity, will, be, motivated, by, normative, influence, the, participants, will, conform, in, order, to, be, accepted, by, the, group, a, participant, may, not, feel, much, pressure, to, conform, when, the, first, person, gives, an, incorrect, response, however, conformity, pressure, will, increase, as, each, additional, group, member, also, gives, the, same, incorrect, response, research, has, found, different, group, and, situation, factors, that, affect, conformity, accountability, increases, conformity, if, an, individual, is, trying, to, be, accepted, by, a, group, which, has, certain, preferences, then, individuals, are, more, likely, to, conform, to, match, the, group, similarly, the, attractiveness, of, group, members, increases, conformity, if, an, individual, wishes, to, be, liked, by, the, group, they, are, increasingly, likely, to, conform, accuracy, also, effects, conformity, as, the, more, accurate, and, reasonable, the, majority, is, in, their, decision, than, the, more, likely, the, individual, will, be, to, conform, as, mentioned, earlier, size, also, effects, individuals, likelihood, to, conform, the, larger, the, majority, the, more, likely, an, individual, will, conform, to, that, majority, similarly, the, less, ambiguous, the, task, or, decision, is, the, more, likely, someone, will, conform, to, the, group, when, tasks, are, ambiguous, people, are, less, pressured, to, conform, task, difficulty, also, increases, conformity, but, research, has, found, that, conformity, increases, when, the, task, is, difficult, but, also, important, research, has, also, found, that, as, individuals, become, more, aware, that, they, disagree, with, the, majority, they, feel, more, pressure, and, hence, are, more, likely, to, conform, to, the, decisions, of, the, group, likewise, when, responses, must, be, made, face, face, individuals, increasingly, conform, and, therefore, conformity, increases, as, the, anonymity, of, the, response, in, a, group, decreases, conformity, also, increases, when, individuals, have, committed, themselves, to, the, group, making, decisions, conformity, has, also, been, shown, to, be, linked, to, cohesiveness, cohesiveness, is, how, strongly, members, of, a, group, are, linked, together, and, conformity, has, been, found, to, increase, as, group, cohesiveness, increases, similarly, conformity, is, also, higher, when, individuals, are, committed, and, wish, to, stay, in, the, group, conformity, is, also, higher, when, individuals, are, in, situations, involving, existential, thoughts, that, cause, anxiety, in, these, situations, individuals, are, more, likely, to, conform, to, the, majority, s, decisions, in, 1961, stanley, milgram, published, a, study, in, which, he, utilized, asch, s, conformity, paradigm, using, audio, tones, instead, of, lines, he, conducted, his, study, in, norway, and, france, he, found, substantially, higher, levels, of, conformity, than, asch, with, participants, conforming, 50, of, the, time, in, france, and, 62, of, the, time, in, norway, during, critical, trials, milgram, also, conducted, the, same, experiment, once, more, but, told, participants, that, the, results, of, the, study, would, be, applied, to, the, design, of, aircraft, safety, signals, his, conformity, estimates, were, 56, in, norway, and, 46, in, france, suggesting, that, individuals, conformed, slightly, less, when, the, task, was, linked, to, an, important, issue, stanley, milgram, s, study, demonstrated, that, asch, s, study, could, be, replicated, with, other, stimuli, and, that, in, the, case, of, tones, there, was, a, high, degree, of, conformity, evidence, has, been, found, for, the, involvement, of, the, posterior, medial, frontal, cortex, pmfc, in, conformity, an, area, associated, with, memory, and, decision, making, for, example, klucharev, et, al, revealed, in, their, study, that, by, using, repetitive, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, on, the, pmfc, participants, reduced, their, tendency, to, conform, to, the, group, suggesting, a, causal, role, for, the, brain, region, in, social, conformity, neuroscience, has, also, shown, how, people, quickly, develop, similar, values, for, things, opinions, of, others, immediately, change, the, brain, s, reward, response, in, the, ventral, striatum, to, receiving, or, losing, the, object, in, question, in, proportion, to, how, susceptible, the, person, is, to, social, influence, having, similar, opinions, to, others, can, also, generate, a, reward, response, the, amygdala, and, hippocampus, have, also, been, found, to, be, recruited, when, individuals, participated, in, a, social, manipulation, experiment, involving, long, term, memory, several, other, areas, have, further, been, suggested, to, play, a, role, in, conformity, including, the, insula, the, temporoparietal, junction, the, ventral, striatum, and, the, anterior, and, posterior, cingulate, cortices, more, recent, work, stresses, the, role, of, orbitofrontal, cortex, ofc, in, conformity, not, only, at, the, time, of, social, influence, but, also, later, on, when, participants, are, given, an, opportunity, to, conform, by, selecting, an, action, in, particular, charpentier, et, al, found, that, the, ofc, mirrors, the, exposure, to, social, influence, at, a, subsequent, time, point, when, a, decision, is, being, made, without, the, social, influence, being, present, the, tendency, to, conform, has, also, been, observed, in, the, structure, of, the, ofc, with, a, greater, grey, matter, volume, in, high, conformers
