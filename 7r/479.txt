and, tungusic, with, various, other, language, families, proposed, for, inclusion, by, linguists, altaic, theory, has, fallen, out, of, favour, since, the, 1960s, and, a, majority, of, linguists, now, consider, turkic, languages, to, be, unrelated, to, any, other, language, family, though, the, altaic, hypothesis, still, has, a, small, degree, of, support, from, individual, linguists, the, nineteenth, century, ural, altaic, theory, which, grouped, turkish, with, finnish, hungarian, and, altaic, languages, is, considered, even, less, plausible, in, light, of, altaic, s, rejection, the, theory, was, based, mostly, on, the, fact, these, languages, share, three, features, agglutination, vowel, harmony, and, lack, of, grammatical, gender, the, earliest, known, old, turkic, inscriptions, are, the, three, monumental, orkhon, inscriptions, found, in, modern, mongolia, erected, in, honour, of, the, prince, kul, tigin, and, his, brother, emperor, bilge, khagan, these, date, back, to, the,

surrounding, the, orkhon, valley, between, 1889, and, 1893, it, became, established, that, the, language, on, the, inscriptions, was, the, old, turkic, language, written, using, the, old, turkic, alphabet, which, has, also, been, referred, to, as, turkic, runes, or, runiform, due, to, a, superficial, similarity, to, the, germanic, runic, alphabets, with, the, turkic, expansion, during, early, middle, ages, c, 6th, 11th, centuries, peoples, speaking, turkic, languages, spread, across, central, asia, covering, a, vast, geographical, region, stretching, from, siberia, all, the, way, to, europe, and, the, mediterranean, the, seljuqs, of, the, oghuz, turks, in, particular, brought, their, language, oghuz, the, direct, ancestor, of, today, s, turkish, language, into, anatolia, during, the, 11th, century, also, during, the, 11th, century, an, early, linguist, of, the, turkic, languages, mahmud, al, kashgari, from, the, kara, khanid, khanate, published, the, first, comprehensive, turkic, language, dictionary, and, map, of, the, geographical, distribution, of, turkic, speakers, in, the, d, w, n, lugh, t, al, turk, following, the, adoption, of, islam, around, the, year, 950, by, the, kara, khanid, khanate, and, the, seljuq, turks, who, are, both, regarded, as, the, ethnic, and, cultural, ancestors, of, the, ottomans, the, administrative, language, of, these, states, acquired, a, large, collection, of, loanwords, from, arabic, and, persian, turkish, literature, during, the, ottoman, period, particularly, divan, poetry, was, heavily, influenced, by, persian, including, the, adoption, of, poetic, meters, and, a, great, quantity, of, imported, words, the, literary, and, official, language, during, the, ottoman, empire, period, c, 1299, 1922, is, termed, ottoman, turkish, which, was, a, mixture, of, turkish, persian, and, arabic, that, differed, considerably, and, was, largely, unintelligible, to, the, period, s, everyday, turkish, the, everyday, turkish, known, as, kaba, t, rk, e, or, vulgar, turkish, spoken, by, the, less, educated, lower, and, also, rural, members, of, society, contained, a, higher, percentage, of, native, vocabulary, and, served, as, basis, for, the, modern, turkish, language, while, visiting, the, region, between, ad, yaman, and, adana, evliya, elebi, recorded, the, turkman, language, and, compared, it, with, his, own, turkish, reforms, kemalism, after, the, foundation, of, the, modern, state, of, turkey, and, the, script, reform, the, turkish, language, association, tdk, was, established, in, 1932, under, the, patronage, of, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, with, the, aim, of, conducting, research, on, turkish, one, of, the, tasks, of, the, newly, established, association, was, to, initiate, a, language, reform, to, replace, loanwords, of, arabic, and, persian, origin, with, turkish, equivalents, by, banning, the, usage, of, imported, words, in, the, press, the, association, succeeded, in, removing, several, hundred, foreign, words, from, the, language, while, most, of, the, words, introduced, to, the, language, by, the, tdk, were, newly, derived, from, turkic, roots, it, also, opted, for, reviving, old, turkish, words, which, had, not, been, used, for, centuries, in, 1935, the, tdk, published, a, bilingual, ottoman, turkish, pure, turkish, dictionary, that, documents, the, results, of, the, language, reform, owing, to, this, sudden, change, in, the, language, older, and, younger, people, in, turkey, started, to, differ, in, their, vocabularies, while, the, generations, born, before, the, 1940s, tend, to, use, the, older, terms, of, arabic, or, persian, origin, the, younger, generations, favor, new, expressions, it, is, considered, particularly, ironic, that, atat, rk, himself, in, his, lengthy, speech, to, the, new, parliament, in, 1927, used, the, formal, style, of, ottoman, turkish, that, had, been, common, at, the, time, amongst, statesmen, and, the, educated, strata, of, society, in, the, setting, of, formal, speeches, and, documents, after, the, language, reform, the, turkish, education, system, discontinued, the, teaching, of, literary, form, of, ottoman, turkish, and, the, speaking, and, writing, ability, of, society, atrophied, to, the, point, that, in, later, years, turkish, society, would, perceive, the, speech, to, be, so, alien, to, listeners, that, it, had, to, be, translated, three, times, into, modern, turkish, first, in, 1963, again, in, 1986, and, most, recently, in, 1995, the, past, few, decades, have, seen, the, continuing, work, of, the, tdk, to, coin, new, turkish, words, to, express, new, concepts, and, technologies, as, they, enter, the, language, mostly, from, english, many, of, these, new, words, particularly, information, technology, terms, have, received, widespread, acceptance, however, the, tdk, is, occasionally, criticized, for, coining, words, which, sound, contrived, and, artificial, some, earlier, changes, such, as, b, lem, to, replace, f, rka, political, party, also, failed, to, meet, with, popular, approval, f, rka, has, been, replaced, by, the, french, loanword, parti, some, words, restored, from, old, turkic, have, taken, on, specialized, meanings, for, example, betik, originally, meaning, book, is, now, used, to, mean, script, in, computer, science, some, examples, of, modern, turkish, words, and, the, old, loanwords, are, turkish, is, natively, spoken, by, the, turkish, people, in, turkey, and, by, the, turkish, diaspora, in, some, 30, other, countries, the, turkish, language, is, mutually, intelligible, with, azerbaijani, in, particular, turkish, speaking, minorities, exist, in, countries, that, formerly, in, whole, or, part, belonged, to, the, ottoman, empire, such, as, iraq, bulgaria, cyprus, greece, primarily, in, western, thrace, the, republic, of, north, macedonia, romania, and, serbia, more, than, two, million, turkish, speakers, live, in, germany, and, there, are, significant, turkish, speaking, communities, in, the, united, states, france, the, netherlands, austria, belgium, switzerland, and, the, united, kingdom, due, to, the, cultural, assimilation, of, turkish, immigrants, in, host, countries, not, all, ethnic, members, of, the, diaspora, speak, the, language, with, native, fluency, in, 2005, 93, of, the, population, of, turkey, were, native, speakers, of, turkish, about, 67, million, at, the, time, with, kurdish, languages, making, up, most, of, the, remainder, azerbaijani, language, official, in, azerbaijan, is, mutually, intelligible, with, turkish, and, speakers, of, both, languages, can, understand, them, without, noticeable, difficulty, especially, when, discussion, comes, on, ordinary, daily, language, turkey, has, very, good, relations, with, azerbaijan, with, a, multitude, of, turkish, companies, and, authorities, investing, there, while, the, influence, of, turkey, in, the, country, is, very, high, the, rising, presence, of, this, very, similar, language, in, azerbaijan, and, the, fact, that, many, children, use, turkish, words, instead, of, azerbaijani, words, due, to, satellite, tv, has, caused, concern, that, the, distinctive, features, of, the, language, will, be, eroded, many, bookstores, sell, books, in, turkish, language, along, azerbaijani, language, ones, with, agalar, mahmadov, a, leading, intellectual, voicing, his, concern, that, turkish, language, has, already, started, to, take, over, the, national, and, natural, dialects, of, azerbaijan, however, the, presence, of, turkish, as, foreign, language, is, not, as, high, as, russian, in, uzbekistan, the, second, most, populated, turkic, country, a, new, tv, channel, foreign, languages, tv, was, established, in, 2022, this, channel, has, been, broadcasting, turkish, lessons, along, with, english, french, german, and, russian, lessons, turkish, is, the, official, language, of, turkey, and, is, one, of, the, official, languages, of, cyprus, turkish, has, official, status, in, 38, municipalities, in, kosovo, including, mamusha, two, in, the, republic, of, north, macedonia, and, in, kirkuk, governorate, in, iraq, cyprus, has, requested, the, european, union, to, add, turkish, as, an, official, language, as, it, is, one, of, the, two, official, languages, of, the, country, in, turkey, the, regulatory, body, for, turkish, is, the, turkish, language, association, t, rk, dil, kurumu, or, tdk, which, was, founded, in, 1932, under, the, name, t, rk, dili, tetkik, cemiyeti, society, for, research, on, the, turkish, language, the, turkish, language, association, was, influenced, by, the, ideology, of, linguistic, purism, indeed, one, of, its, primary, tasks, was, the, replacement, of, loanwords, and, of, foreign, grammatical, constructions, with, equivalents, of, turkish, origin, these, changes, together, with, the, adoption, of, the, new, turkish, alphabet, in, 1928, shaped, the, modern, turkish, language, spoken, today, the, tdk, became, an, independent, body, in, 1951, with, the, lifting, of, the, requirement, that, it, should, be, presided, over, by, the, minister, of, education, this, status, continued, until, august, 1983, when, it, was, again, made, into, a, governmental, body, in, the, constitution, of, 1982, following, the, military, coup, d, tat, of, 1980, modern, standard, turkish, is, based, on, the, dialect, of, istanbul, this, istanbul, turkish, stanbul, t, rk, esi, constitutes, the, model, of, written, and, spoken, turkish, as, recommended, by, ziya, g, kalp, mer, seyfettin, and, others, dialectal, variation, persists, in, spite, of, the, levelling, influence, of, the, standard, used, in, mass, media, and, in, the, turkish, education, system, since, the, 1930s, academic, researchers, from, turkey, often, refer, to, turkish, dialects, as, a, z, or, ive, leading, to, an, ambiguity, with, the, linguistic, concept, of, accent, which, is, also, covered, with, these, words, several, universities, as, well, as, a, dedicated, work, group, of, the, turkish, language, association, carry, out, projects, investigating, turkish, dialects, as, of, 2002, work, continued, on, the, compilation, and, publication, of, their, research, as, a, comprehensive, dialect, atlas, of, the, turkish, language, although, the, ottoman, alphabet, being, slightly, more, phonetically, ambiguous, than, the, latin, script, encoded, for, many, of, the, dialectal, variations, between, turkish, dialects, the, modern, latin, script, fails, to, do, this, examples, of, this, are, the, presence, of, the, nasal, velar, sound, in, certain, eastern, dialects, of, turkish, which, was, represented, by, the, ottoman, letter, but, that, was, merged, into, n, in, the, latin, script, additionally, are, letters, such, as, which, make, the, sounds, and, respectively, in, certain, eastern, dialects, but, that, are, merged, into, and, in, western, dialects, and, are, therefore, defectively, represented, in, the, latin, alphabet, for, speakers, of, eastern, dialects, some, immigrants, to, turkey, from, rumelia, speak, rumelian, turkish, which, includes, the, distinct, dialects, of, ludogorie, dinler, and, adakale, which, show, the, influence, of, the, theorized, balkan, sprachbund, k, br, s, t, rk, esi, is, the, name, for, cypriot, turkish, and, is, spoken, by, the, turkish, cypriots, edirne, is,

own, dialect, of, turkish, this, group, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, yuruk, nomads, of, macedonia, greece, and, european, turkey, who, speak, balkan, gagauz, turkish, the, meskhetian, turks, who, live, in, kazakhstan, azerbaijan, and, russia, as, well, as, in, several, central, asian, countries, also, speak, an, eastern, anatolian, dialect, of, turkish, originating, in, the, areas, of, kars, ardahan, and, artvin, and, sharing, similarities, with, azerbaijani, the, language, of, azerbaijan, the, central, anatolia, region, speaks, orta, anadolu, karadeniz, spoken, in, the, eastern, black, sea, region, and, represented, primarily, by, the, trabzon, dialect, exhibits, substratum, influence, from, greek, in, phonology, and, syntax, it, is, also, known, as, laz, dialect, not, to, be, confused, with, the, laz, language, kastamonu, is, spoken, in, kastamonu, and, its, surrounding, areas, karamanli, turkish, is, spoken, in, greece, where, it, is, called, k, it, is, the, literary, standard, for, the, karamanlides, at, least, one, source, claims, turkish, consonants, are, laryngeally, specified, three, way, fortis, lenis, aspirated, neutral, voiced, like, armenian, the, phoneme, that, is, usually, referred, to, as, yumu, ak, g, soft, g, written, in, turkish, orthography, represents, a, vowel, sequence, or, a, rather, weak, bilabial, approximant, between, rounded, vowels, a, weak, palatal, approximant, between, unrounded, front, vowels, and, a, vowel, sequence, elsewhere, it, never, occurs, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, or, a, syllable, but, always, follows, a, vowel, when, word, final, or, preceding, another, consonant, it, lengthens, the, preceding, vowel, in, native, turkic, words, the, sounds, and, are, mainly, in, complementary, distribution, with, and, the, former, set, occurs, adjacent, to, front, vowels, and, the, latter, adjacent, to, back, vowels, the, distribution, of, these, phonemes, is, often, unpredictable, however, in, foreign, borrowings, and, proper, nouns, in, such, words, and, often, occur, with, back, vowels, 93, 4, 6, some, examples, are, given, below, however, there, are, minimal, pairs, that, distinguish, between, these, sounds, such, as, kar, snow, vs, k, r, profit, turkish, orthography, reflects, final, obstruent, devoicing, a, form, of, consonant, mutation, whereby, a, voiced, obstruent, such, as, b, d, d, is, devoiced, to, at, the, end, of, a, word, or, before, a, consonant, but, retains, its, voicing, before, a, vowel, in, loan, words, the, voiced, equivalent, of, k, is, g, in, native, words, it, is, this, is, analogous, to, languages, such, as, german, and, russian, but, in, the, case, of, turkish, it, only, applies, as, the, above, examples, demonstrate, to, stops, and, affricates, not, to, fricatives, the, spelling, is, usually, made, to, match, the, sound, however, in, a, few, cases, such, as, ad, name, dative, ada, the, underlying, form, is, retained, in, the, spelling, cf, at, horse, dative, ata, other, exceptions, are, od, fire, vs, ot, herb, sac, sheet, metal, sa, hair, most, loanwords, such, as, kitap, above, are, spelled, as, pronounced, but, a, few, such, as, hac, hajj, ad, happy, and, yad, strange, or, stranger, also, show, their, underlying, forms, native, nouns, of, two, or, more, syllables, that, end, in, k, in, dictionary, form, are, nearly, all, in, underlying, form, however, most, verbs, and, monosyllabic, nouns, are, underlyingly, k, 10, the, vowels, of, the, turkish, language, are, in, their, alphabetical, order, a, e, i, o, u, the, turkish, vowel, system, can, be, considered, as, being, three, dimensional, where, vowels, are, characterised, by, how, and, where, they, are, articulated, focusing, on, three, key, features, front, and, back, rounded, and, unrounded, and, vowel, height, vowels, are, classified, and, the, only, diphthongs, in, the, language, are, found, in, loanwords, and, may, be, categorised, as, falling, diphthongs, usually, analyzed, as, a, sequence, of, j, and, a, vowel, the, principle, of, vowel, harmony, which, permeates, turkish, word, formation, and, suffixation, is, due, to, the, natural, human, tendency, towards, economy, of, muscular, effort, this, principle, is, expressed, in, turkish, through, three, rules, the, second, and, third, rules, minimize, muscular, effort, during, speech, more, specifically, they, are, related, to, the, phenomenon, of, labial, assimilation, if, the, lips, are, rounded, a, process, that, requires, muscular, effort, for, the, first, vowel, they, may, stay, rounded, for, subsequent, vowels, if, they, are, unrounded, for, the, first, vowel, the, speaker, does, not, make, the, additional, muscular, effort, to, round, them, subsequently, grammatical, affixes, have, a, chameleon, like, quality, 21, and, obey, one, of, the, following, patterns, of, vowel, harmony, practically, the, twofold, pattern, also, referred, to, as, the, e, type, vowel, harmony, means, that, in, the, environment, where, the, vowel, in, the, word, stem, is, formed, in, the, front, of, the, mouth, the, suffix, will, take, the, e, form, while, if, it, is, formed, in, the, back, it, will, take, the, a, form, the, fourfold, pattern, also, called, the, i, type, accounts, for, rounding, as, well, as, for, front, back, the, following, examples, based, on, the, copula, dir, 4, is, illustrate, the, principles, of, i, type, vowel, harmony, in, practice, t, rkiye, dir, it, is, turkey, kap, d, r, it, is, the, door, but, g, n, d, r, it, is, the, day, palto, dur, it, is, the, coat, these, are, four, word, classes, that, are, exceptions, to, the, rules, of, vowel, harmony, the, road, sign, in, the, photograph, above, illustrates, several, of, these, features, the, rules, of, vowel, harmony, may, vary, by, regional, dialect, the, dialect, of, turkish, spoken, in, the, trabzon, region, of, northeastern, turkey, follows, the, reduced, vowel, harmony, of, old, anatolian, turkish, with, the, additional, complication, of, two, missing, vowels, and, thus, there, is, no, palatal, harmony, it, is, likely, that, el, n, meant, your, hand, in, old, anatolian, while, the, 2nd, person, singular, possessive, would, vary, between, back, and, front, vowel, n, or, un, as, in, el, n, for, your, hand, and, kitabun, for, your, book, the, lack, of, vowel, in, the, trabzon, dialect, means, un, would, be, used, in, both, of, these, cases, elun, and, kitabun, with, the, exceptions, stated, below, turkish, words, are, oxytone, accented, on, the, last, syllable, turkish, has, two, groups, of, sentences, verbal, and, nominal, sentences, in, the, case, of, a, verbal, sentence, the, predicate, is, a, finite, verb, while, the, predicate, in, nominal, sentence, will, have, either, no, overt, verb, or, a, verb, in, the, form, of, the, copula, ol, or, y, variants, of, be, examples, of, both, are, given, below, the, two, groups, of, sentences, have, different, ways, of, forming, negation, a, nominal, sentence, can, be, negated, with, the, addition, of, the, word, de, il, for, example, the, sentence, above, would, become, necla, retmen, de, il, necla, is, not, a, teacher, however, the, verbal, sentence, requires, the, addition, of, a, negative, suffix, me, to, the, verb, the, suffix, comes, after, the, stem, but, before, the, tense, necla, okula, gitmedi, necla, did, not, go, to, school, in, the, case, of, a, verbal, sentence, an, interrogative, clitic, mi, is, added, after, the, verb, and, stands, alone, for, example, necla, okula, gitti, mi, did, necla, go, to, school, in, the, case, of, a, nominal, sentence, then, mi, comes, after, the, predicate, but, before, the, personal, ending, so, for, example, necla, siz, retmen, misiniz, necla, are, you, a, teacher, word, order, in, simple, turkish, sentences, is, generally, subject, object, verb, as, in, korean, and, latin, but, unlike, english, for, verbal, sentences, and, subject, predicate, for, nominal, sentences, however, as, turkish, possesses, a, case, marking, system, and, most, grammatical, relations, are, shown, using, morphological, markers, often, the, sov, structure, has, diminished, relevance, and, may, vary, the, sov, structure, may, thus, be, considered, a, pragmatic, word, order, of, language, one, that, does, not, rely, on, word, order, for, grammatical, purposes, consider, the, following, simple, sentence, which, demonstrates, that, the, focus, in, turkish, is, on, the, element, that, immediately, precedes, the, verb, ahmet, ahmet, yumurta, y, egg, acc, yedi, ate, ahmet, yumurta, y, yedi, ahmet, egg, acc, ate, ahmet, ate, the, egg, ahmet, ahmet, yedi, ate, yumurta, y, egg, acc, ahmet, yedi, yumurta, y, ahmet, ate, egg, acc, ahmet, ate, the, egg, yumurta, y, egg, acc, yedi, ate, ahmet, ahmet, yumurta, y, yedi, ahmet, egg, acc, ate, ahmet, ahmet, ate, the, egg, the, postpredicate, position, signifies, what, is, referred, to, as, background, information, in, turkish, information, that, is, assumed, to, be, known, to, both, the, speaker, and, the, listener, or, information, that, is, included, in, the, context, consider, the, following, examples, there, has, been, some, debate, among, linguists, whether, turkish, is, a, subject, prominent, like, english, or, topic, prominent, like, japanese, and, korean, language, with, recent, scholarship, implying, that, it, is, indeed, both, subject, and, topic, prominent, this, has, direct, implications, for, word, order, as, it, is, possible, for, the, subject, to, be, included, in, the, verb, phrase, in, turkish, there, can, be, s, o, inversion, in, sentences, where, the, topic, is, of, greater, importance, than, the, subject, turkish, is, an, agglutinative, language, and, frequently, uses, affixes, and, specifically, suffixes, or, endings, one, word, can, have, many, affixes, and, these, can, also, be, used, to, create, new, words, such, as, creating, a, verb, from, a, noun, or, a, noun, from, a, verbal, root, see, the, section, on, word, formation, most, affixes, indicate, the, grammatical, function, of, the, word, chapter, xiv, the, only, native, prefixes, are, alliterative, intensifying, syllables, used, with, adjectives, or, adverbs, for, example, s, m, s, cak, boiling, hot, s, cak, and, mas, mavi, bright, blue, mavi, the, extensive, use, of, affixes, can, give, rise, to, long, words, e, g, ekoslovakyal, la, t, ramad, klar, m, zdanm, s, n, zcas, na, meaning, in, the, manner, of, you, being, one, of, those, that, we, apparently, couldn, t, manage, to, convert, to,

are, underlined, if, the, second, noun, group, already, had, a, possessive, suffix, because, it, is, a, compound, by, itself, no, further, suffix, is, added, as, the, last, example, shows, the, qualifying, expression, may, be, a, substantival, sentence, rather, than, a, noun, or, noun, group, there, is, a, third, way, of, linking, the, nouns, where, both, nouns, take, no, suffixes, tak, s,

mirative, negation, is, expressed, by, the, suffix, me, immediately, following, the, stem, for, the, sake, of, simplicity, the, term, tense, is, used, here, throughout, although, for, some, forms, aspect, or, mood, might, be, more, appropriate, there, are, nine, simple, and, 20, compound, tenses, in, turkish, the, nine, simple, tenses, are, simple, past, di, li, ge, mi, inferential, past, mi,

thus, while, gittin, means, you, went, gidebildin, means, you, could, go, and, gidiverdin, means, you, went, swiftly, the, tenses, of, the, combined, verbs, are, formed, the, same, way, as, for,

4, and, aorist, er, 2, or, ir, 4, the, most, important, function, of, some, of, these, attributive, verbs, is, to, form, modifying, phrases, equivalent, to, the, relative, clauses, found, in, most, european, languages, the, subject, of, the, verb, in, an, en, 2, form, is, possibly, implicitly, in, the, third, person, he, she, it, they, this, form, when, used, in, a, modifying, phrase, does, not, change, according, to, number, the, other, attributive, forms, used, in, these, constructions, are, the, future, ecek, 2, and, an, older, form, dik, 4, which, covers, both, present, and, past, meanings, these, two, forms, take, personal, endings, which, have, the, same, form, as, the, possessive, suffixes, but, indicate, the, person, and, possibly, number, of, the, subject, of, the, attributive, verb, for, example, yedi, im, means, what, i, eat, yedi, in, means, what, you, eat, and, so, on, the, use, of, these, personal, or, relative, participles, is, illustrated, in, the, following, table, in, which, the, examples, are, presented, according, to, the, grammatical, case, which, would, be, seen, in, the, equivalent, english, relative, clause, imdi, now, konu, an,

articles, turkish, extensively, uses, agglutination, to, form, new, words, from, nouns, and, verbal, stems, the, majority, of, turkish, words, originate, from, the, application, of, derivative, suffixes, to, a, relatively, small, set, of, core, vocabulary, turkish, obeys, certain, principles, when, it, comes, to, suffixation, most, suffixes, in, turkish, will, have, more, than, one, form, depending, on, the, vowels, and, consonants, in, the, root, vowel, harmony, rules, will, apply, consonant, initial, suffixes, will, follow, the, voiced, voiceless, character, of, the, consonant, in, the, final, unit, of, the, root, and, in, the, case, of, vowel, initial, suffixes, an, additional, consonant, may, be, inserted, if, the, root, ends, in, a, vowel, or, the, suffix, may, lose, its, initial, vowel, there, is, also, a, prescribed, order, of, affixation, of, suffixes, as, a, rule, of, thumb, derivative, suffixes, precede, inflectional, suffixes, which, are, followed, by, clitics, as, can, be, seen, in, the, example, set, of, words, derived, from, a, substantive, root, below, another, example, starting, from, a, verbal, root, new, words, are, also, frequently, formed, by, compounding, two, existing, words, into, a, new, one, as, in, german, compounds, can, be, of, two, types, bare, and, s, i, the, bare, compounds, both, nouns, and, adjectives, are, effectively, two, words, juxtaposed, without, the, addition, of, suffixes, for, example, the, word, for, girlfriend, k, zarkada, k, z, arkada, or, black, pepper, karabiber, kara, biber, a, few, examples, of, compound, words, are, given, below, however, the, majority, of, compound, words, in, turkish, are, s, i, compounds, which, means, that, the, second, word, will, be, marked, by, the, 3rd, person, possessive, suffix, a, few, such, examples, are, given, in, the, table, below, note, vowel, harmony, turkish, is, written, using, a, version, of, latin, script, introduced, in, 1928, by, atat, rk, to, replace, the, ottoman, turkish, alphabet, a, version, of, perso, arabic, script, the, ottoman, alphabet, marked, only, three, different, vowels, long, and, and, included, several, redundant, consonants, such, as, variants, of, z, which, were, distinguished, in, arabic, but, not, in, turkish, the, omission, of, short, vowels, in, the, arabic, script, was, claimed, to, make, it, particularly, unsuitable, for, turkish, which, has, eight, vowels, the, reform, of, the, script, was, an, important, step, in, the, cultural, reforms, of, the, period, the, task, of, preparing, the, new, alphabet, and, selecting, the, necessary, modifications, for, sounds, specific, to, turkish, was, entrusted, to, a, language, commission, composed, of, prominent, linguists, academics, and, writers, the, introduction, of, the, new, turkish, alphabet, was, supported, by, public, education, centers, opened, throughout, the, country, cooperation, with, publishing, companies, and, encouragement, by, atat, rk, himself, who, toured, the, country, teaching, the, new, letters, to, the, public, as, a, result, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, literacy, from, its, original, pre, modern, levels, the, latin, alphabet, was, applied, to, the, turkish, language, for, educational, purposes, even, before, the, 20th, century, reform, instances, include, a, 1635, latin, albanian, dictionary, by, frang, bardhi, who, also, incorporated, several, sayings, in, the, turkish, language, as, an, appendix, to, his, work, e, g, alma, agatsdan, irak, duschamas, an, apple, does, not, fall, far, from, its, tree, turkish, now, has, an, alphabet, suited, to, the, sounds, of, the, language, the, spelling, is, largely, phonemic, with, one, letter, corresponding, to, each, phoneme, most, of, the, letters, are, used, approximately, as, in, english, the, main, exceptions, being, c, which, denotes, j, being, used, for, the, found, in, persian, and, european, loans, and, the, undotted, representing, as, in,
