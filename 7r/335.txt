https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(sociolinguistics)
in, sociolinguistics, an, accent, is, a, way, of, pronouncing, a, language, that, is, distinctive, to, a, country, area, social, class, or, individual, an, accent, may, be, identified, with, the, locality, in, which, its, speakers, reside, a, regional, or, geographical, accent, the, socioeconomic, status, of, its, speakers, their, ethnicity, an, ethnolect, their, caste, or, social, class, a, social, accent, or, influence, from, their, first, language, a, foreign, accent, accents, typically, differ, in, quality, of, voice, pronunciation, and, distinction, of, vowels, and, consonants, stress, and, prosody, although, grammar, semantics, vocabulary, and, other, language, characteristics, often, vary, concurrently, with, accent, the, word, accent, may, refer, specifically, to, the, differences, in, pronunciation, whereas, the, word, dialect, encompasses, the, broader, set, of, linguistic, differences, accent, is, often, a, subset, of, dialect, as, human, beings, spread, out, into, isolated, communities, stresses, and, peculiarities, develop, over, time, they, can, develop, into, identifiable, accents, in, north, america, the, interaction, of, people, from, many, ethnic, backgrounds, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, different, varieties, of, north, american, accents, it, is, difficult, to, measure, or, predict, how, long, it, takes, an, accent, to, form, accents, from, canada, south, africa, australia, and, the, united, states, for, example, developed, from, the, combinations, of, different, accents, and, languages, in, various, societies, and, their, effect, on, the, various, pronunciations, of, british, settlers, accents, may, vary, within, regions, of, an, area, in, which, a, uniform, language, is, spoken, in, some, cases, such, as, regional, accents, of, english, in, the, united, states, accents, can, be, traced, back, to, when, an, area, was, settled, and, by, whom, areas, like, the, city, of, new, orleans, in, louisiana, that, are, or, at, one, point, in, time, were, semi, isolated, have, distinct, accents, due, to, the, absence, of, contact, between, regions, isolated, regions, allow, dialects, to, expand, and, evolve, independently, social, and, economic, factors, can, also, influence, the, way, people, speak, during, the, early, period, of, rapid, cognitive, development, in, a, child, s, life, it, is, much, easier, to, develop, and, master, foreign, skills, such, as, learning, a, new, or, first, language, verbal, cues, are, processed, and, silently, learned, in, preparation, for, the, day, the, vocal, system, is, developed, enough, to, speak, its, first, words, usually, around, 12, months, before, infants, can, identify, words, they, just, hear, sounds, that, they, come, to, recognize, eventually, neural, pathways, are, established, in, the, brain, that, link, each, sound, with, a, meaning, the, more, frequently, a, word, is, heard, the, more, its, connection, is, solidified, and, the, same, goes, for, accents, there, is, no, standard, accent, for, the, child, to, practice, as, far, as, they, are, concerned, the, accent, they, hear, from, their, parents, is, not, the, right, way, but, the, only, way, eventually, children, graduate, from, the, conscious, act, of, recalling, each, word, and, it, becomes, natural, like, breathing, as, children, grow, up, they, learn, vocabulary, of, the, language, they, are, immersed, in, whether, assisted, by, parents, or, not, however, their, first, few, encounters, with, words, determine, the, way, they, will, pronounce, them, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, this, is, how, accents, are, cultivated, in, groups, as, small, as, towns, and, as, large, as, countries, it, is, a, compounding, effect, though, it, is, possible, to, develop, a, new, accent, or, lose, an, old, one, it, is, difficult, because, the, neural, pathways, created, when, learning, the, language, were, developed, with, the, original, pronunciations, children, are, able, to, take, on, accents, relatively, quickly, children, of, immigrant, families, for, example, generally, have, a, pronunciation, more, similar, to, people, native, to, where, they, live, compared, to, their, parents, but, both, children, and, parents, may, have, an, accent, noticeably, differing, from, local, people, accents, seem, to, remain, relatively, malleable, until, a, person, s, early, twenties, after, which, a, person, s, accent, seems, to, become, more, entrenched, nonetheless, accents, are, not, fixed, even, in, adulthood, an, acoustic, analysis, by, jonathan, harrington, of, elizabeth, ii, s, royal, christmas, messages, revealed, that, the, speech, patterns, of, even, so, conservative, a, figure, as, a, monarch, can, continue, to, change, over, her, lifetime, accents, of, non, native, speakers, may, be, the, result, of, the, speaker, s, native, language, each, language, contains, distinct, sets, of, sounds, at, around, 12, months, of, age, human, infants, will, pick, out, which, sounds, they, need, to, learn, their, language, as, they, get, older, it, becomes, increasingly, harder, to, learn, these, forgotten, sounds, a, prime, example, of, this, can, be, seen, between, german, and, english, the, w, and, th, sounds, like, in, the, english, words, wish, and, this, respectively, do, not, exist, in, german, the, closest, sounds, are, v, and, z, as, a, result, many, english, speaking, germans, pronounce, wish, as, vish, and, this, as, zis, a, similar, disjunction, occurs, in, german, speaking, native, english, speakers, who, may, find, it, difficult, to, pronounce, the, vowels, in, german, words, such, as, sch, n, beautiful, and, m, de, tired, an, important, factor, in, predicting, the, degree, to, which, the, accent, will, be, noticeable, or, strong, is, the, age, at, which, the, non, native, language, was, learned, the, critical, period, theory, states, that, if, learning, takes, place, after, the, critical, period, usually, considered, around, puberty, for, acquiring, native, like, pronunciation, an, individual, is, unlikely, to, acquire, a, native, like, accent, this, theory, however, is, quite, controversial, among, researchers, although, many, subscribe, to, some, form, of, the, critical, period, they, either, place, it, earlier, than, puberty, or, consider, it, more, of, a, critical, window, which, may, vary, from, one, individual, to, another, and, depend, on, factors, other, than, age, such, as, length, of, residence, similarity, of, the, non, native, language, to, the, native, language, and, the, frequency, with, which, both, languages, are, used, nevertheless, children, as, young, as, 6, at, the, time, of, moving, to, another, country, often, speak, with, a, noticeable, non, native, accent, as, adults, there, are, also, rare, instances, of, individuals, who, are, able, to, pass, for, native, speakers, even, if, they, learned, their, non, native, language, in, early, adulthood, however, neurological, constraints, associated, with, brain, development, appear, to, limit, most, non, native, speakers, ability, to, sound, native, like, most, researchers, agree, that, for, most, adults, acquiring, a, native, like, accent, in, a, non, native, language, is, near, impossible, when, a, group, defines, a, standard, pronunciation, speakers, who, deviate, from, it, are, often, said, to, speak, with, an, accent, however, everyone, speaks, with, an, accent, people, from, the, united, states, would, speak, english, with, an, accent, from, the, point, of, view, of, an, australian, and, vice, versa, accents, such, as, received, pronunciation, or, general, american, english, may, sometimes, be, erroneously, designated, in, their, countries, of, origin, as, accentless, to, indicate, that, they, offer, no, obvious, clue, to, the, speaker, s, regional, or, social, background, accents, are, an, important, dimension, of, social, identity, both, individual, and, communal, due, to, their, ability, to, identify, group, or, community, belonging, one, s, accent, can, showcase, their, class, religion, or, sexual, orientation, many, teachers, of, english, as, a, second, language, for, example, neglect, teaching, speech, and, pronunciation, many, adult, and, near, adult, learners, of, second, languages, have, unintelligible, speech, patterns, that, may, interfere, with, their, education, profession, and, social, interactions, pronunciation, in, a, second, or, foreign, language, involves, more, than, the, correct, articulation, of, individual, sounds, it, involves, producing, a, wide, range, of, complex, and, subtle, distinctions, which, relate, sound, to, meaning, at, several, levels, teaching, of, speech, pronunciation, is, neglected, in, part, because, of, the, following, myths, inadequate, instruction, in, speech, pronunciation, can, result, in, a, complete, breakdown, in, communication, the, proliferation, of, commercial, accent, reduction, services, is, seen, as, a, sign, that, many, esl, teachers, are, not, meeting, their, students, needs, for, speech, pronunciation, instruction, the, goals, of, speech, pronunciation, instruction, should, include, to, help, the, learner, speak, in, a, way, that, is, easy, to, understand, and, does, not, distract, the, listener, to, increase, the, self, confidence, of, the, learner, and, to, develop, the, skills, to, self, monitor, and, adapt, one, s, own, speech, even, when, the, listener, does, understand, the, speaker, the, presence, of, an, accent, that, is, difficult, to, understand, can, produce, anxiety, in, the, listener, that, he, will, not, understand, what, comes, next, and, cause, him, to, end, the, conversation, earlier, or, avoid, difficult, topics, in, speech, the, perceptual, salience, of, the, accent, overrides, other, measures, of, competence, and, performance, wrote, ingrid, piller, intelligibility, of, speech, in, comparison, to, native, like, accent, has, been, experimentally, reported, to, be, of, greater, importance, for, the, second, language, speakers, as, such, ways, of, increasing, intelligibility, of, speech, has, been, recommended, by, some, researchers, within, the, field, a, strong, accent, does, not, necessarily, impede, intelligibility, despite, common, perceptions, certain, accents, particularly, those, of, european, heritage, are, perceived, to, carry, more, prestige, in, a, society, than, other, accents, such, that, some, speakers, may, as, a, result, consciously, adopt, them, this, is, often, due, to, their, association, with, the, elite, part, of, society, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, received, pronunciation, of, the, english, language, is, associated, with, the, traditional, upper, class, the, same, can, be, said, about, the, predominance, of, southeastern, brazilian, accents, in, the, case, of, the, brazilian, variant, of, the, portuguese, language, especially, considering, the, disparity, of, prestige, between, most, caipira, influenced, speech, associated, with, rural, environment, and, lack, of, formal, education, together, with, the, portuguese, spoken, in, some, other, communities, of, lower, socioeconomic, strata, such, as, favela, dwellers, and, other, sociocultural, variants, such, as, middle, and, upper, class, paulistano, dialect, spoken, from, greater, s, o, paulo, to, the, east, and, fluminense, dialect, spoken, in, the, state, of, rio, de, janeiro, to, the, other, side, inside, southeastern, brazil, itself, in, linguistics, there, is, no, differentiation, among, accents, in, regard, to, their, prestige, aesthetics, or, correctness, all, languages, and, accents, are, linguistically, equal, negative, perceptions, of, accents, the, basis, of, which, may, relate, to, the, speaker, s, social, identity, can, manifest, as, stereotyping, harassment, or, employment, discrimination, researchers, consistently, show, that, people, with, non, native, accents, are, judged, as, less, intelligent, less, competent, less, educated, having, poor, english, language, skills, and, unpleasant, to, listen, to, not, only, people, with, standard, accents, subscribe, to, these, beliefs, and, attitudes, but, individuals, with, accents, also, often, stereotype, against, their, own, or, others, accents, research, demonstrates, that, an, average, listener, is, adept, at, detecting, an, accent, typical, of, a, language, differing, from, their, own, accents, have, even, found, to, be, more, impactful, on, perception, of, babies, than, known, perceptual, dividers, like, race, religion, or, sex, in, a, pnas, study, babies, were, told, to, choose, a, toy, from, two, recorded, speakers, with, varying, characteristics, ahead, of, all, variables, tested, including, race, and, gender, recordings, speaking, with, an, accent, native, to, the, child, were, selected, at, a, considerably, higher, frequency, unlike, other, forms, of, discrimination, there, are, no, strong, norms, against, accent, discrimination, in, the, general, society, rosina, lippi, green, writes, accent, serves, as, the, first, point, of, gate, keeping, because, we, are, forbidden, by, law, and, social, custom, and, perhaps, by, a, prevailing, sense, of, what, is, morally, and, ethically, right, from, using, race, ethnicity, homeland, or, economics, more, directly, we, have, no, such, compunctions, about, language, thus, accent, becomes, a, litmus, test, for, exclusion, and, excuse, to, turn, away, to, recognize, the, other, in, the, english, speaking, world, speakers, with, certain, accents, often, experience, discrimination, in, housing, and, employment, for, example, speakers, who, have, foreign, or, ethnic, minority, accents, are, less, likely, to, be, called, back, by, landlords, and, are, more, likely, to, be, assigned, by, employers, to, lower, status, positions, than, those, with, standard, accents, in, business, settings, individuals, with, non, standard, accents, are, more, likely, to, be, evaluated, negatively, accent, discrimination, is, also, present, in, educational, institutions, for, example, non, native, speaking, graduate, students, lecturers, and, professors, across, college, campuses, in, the, us, have, been, targeted, for, being, unintelligible, because, of, accent, second, language, speakers, have, reported, being, discriminated, against, or, feeling, marginalized, for, when, they, attempted, to, find, a, job, in, higher, ranking, positions, mainly, because, of, their, accents, on, average, however, students, taught, by, non, native, english, speakers, do, not, underperform, when, compared, to, those, taught, by, native, speakers, of, english, some, english, native, speaker, students, in, canada, reported, a, preference, for, non, native, speaker, instructors, as, long, as, the, instructor, s, speech, is, intelligible, this, was, due, to, the, psychological, impacts, such, circumstances, has, on, the, students, requiring, them, to, pay, closer, attention, to, the, instructor, to, ensure, they, understand, them, studies, have, shown, the, perception, of, the, accent, not, the, accent, by, itself, often, results, in, negative, evaluations, of, speakers, in, a, study, conducted, by, rubin, 1992, students, listened, to, a, taped, lecture, recorded, by, a, native, english, speaker, with, a, standard, accent, they, were, then, shown, an, image, of, the, lecturer, sometimes, asian, looking, sometimes, white, participants, in, the, study, who, saw, the, asian, picture, believed, that, they, had, heard, an, accented, lecturer, and, performed, worse, on, a, task, that, measured, lecture, comprehension, negative, evaluations, may, reflect, the, prejudices, rather, than, real, issues, with, understanding, accents, in, the, united, states, title, vii, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, prohibits, discrimination, based, on, national, origin, implying, accents, however, employers, may, claim, that, a, person, s, accent, impairs, their, communication, skills, that, are, necessary, to, the, effective, business, operation, the, courts, often, rely, on, the, employer, s, claims, or, use, judges, subjective, opinions, when, deciding, whether, the, potential, employee, s, accent, would, interfere, with, communication, or, performance, without, any, objective, proof, that, accent, was, or, might, be, a, hindrance, kentucky, s, highest, court, in, the, case, of, clifford, vs, commonwealth, held, that, a, white, police, officer, who, had, not, seen, the, black, defendant, allegedly, involved, in, a, drug, transaction, could, nevertheless, identify, him, as, a, participant, by, saying, that, a, voice, on, an, audiotape, sounded, black, the, police, officer, based, this, identification, on, the, fact, that, the, defendant, was, the, only, african, american, man, in, the, room, at, the, time, of, the, transaction, and, that, an, audio, tape, contained, the, voice, of, a, man, the, officer, said, sounded, black, selling, crack, cocaine, to, a, european, american, informant, planted, by, the, police, actors, are, often, called, upon, to, speak, a, language, variety, other, than, their, own, for, instance, an, actor, may, portray, a, character, of, some, nationality, other, than, their, own, by, adopting, into, their, native, language, the, phonological, profile, typical, of, the, nationality, to, be, portrayed, in, what, is, commonly, known, as, speaking, with, an, accent, accents, may, have, stereotypical, associations, in, entertainment, for, example, in, disney, animated, films, mothers, and, fathers, typically, speak, with, white, middle, class, american, or, english, accents, on, another, note, english, accents, in, disney, animated, films, are, frequently, employed, for, one, of, two, purposes, slapstick, comedy, and, the, portrayal, of, evil, geniuses, examples, of, this, can, be, seen, in, characters, from, the, films, aladdin, the, sultan, and, jafar, respectively, and, the, lion, king, zazu, and, scar, respectively, among, others
