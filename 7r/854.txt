united, states, were, motivated, by, a, sexual, orientation, bias, moreover, in, a, southern, poverty, law, center, 2010, intelligence, report, extrapolating, data, from, fbi, national, hate, crime, statistics, from, 1995, to, 2008, found, that, lgbt, people, were, far, more, likely, than, any, other, minority, group, in, the, united, states, to, be, victimized, by, violent, hate, crime, although, sexual, attitudes, tracing, back, to, ancient, greece, from, the, 8th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, to, the, end, of, antiquity, c, 600, ad, have, been, termed, homophobia, by, scholars, and, it, is, used, to, describe, an, intolerance, towards, homosexuality, and, homosexuals, that, grew, during, the, middle, ages, especially, by, adherents, of, islam, and, christianity, the, term, itself, is, relatively, new, coined, by, george, weinberg, a, psychologist, in, the, 1960s, the, term, homophobia, is, a, blend, of, 1, the, word, homo, sexual, itself, a, mix, of, neo, classical, morphemes, and, 2, phobia, from, the, greek, ph, bos, meaning, fear, morbid, fear, or, aversion, weinberg, is, credited, as, the, first, person, to, have, used, the, term, in, speech, the, word, homophobia, first, appeared, in, print, in, an, article, written, for, the, 23, may, 1969, edition, of, the, american, pornographic, magazine, screw, in, which, the, word, was, used, to, refer, to, heterosexual, men, s, fear, that, others, might, think, they, are, gay, conceptualizing, anti, lgbt, prejudice, as, a, social, problem, worthy, of, scholarly, attention, was, not, new, a, 1969, article, in, time, described, examples, of, negative, attitudes, toward, homosexuality, as, homophobia, including, a, mixture, of, revulsion, and, apprehension, which, some, called, homosexual, panic, in, 1971, kenneth, smith, used, homophobia, as, a, personality, profile, to, describe, the, psychological, aversion, to, homosexuality, weinberg, also, used, it, this, way, in, his, 1972, book, society, and, the, healthy, homosexual, published, one, year, before, the, american, psychiatric, association, voted, to, remove, homosexuality, from, its, list, of, mental, disorders, weinberg, s, term, became, an, important, tool, for, gay, and, lesbian, activists, advocates, and, their, allies, he, describes, the, concept, as, a, medical, phobia, phobia, about, homosexuals, it, was, a, fear, of, homosexuals, which, seemed, to, be, associated, with, a, fear, of, contagion, a, fear, of, reducing, the, things, one, fought, for, home, and, family, it, was, a, religious, fear, and, it, had, led, to, great, brutality, as, fear, always, does, in, 1981, homophobia, was, used, for, the, first, time, in, the, times, of, london, to, report, that, the, general, synod, of, the, church, of, england, voted, to, refuse, to, condemn, homosexuality, however, when, taken, literally, homophobia, may, be, a, problematic, term, professor, david, a, f, haaga, says, that, contemporary, usage, includes, a, wide, range, of, negative, emotions, attitudes, and, behaviours, toward, homosexual, people, which, are, characteristics, that, are, not, consistent, with, accepted, definitions, of, phobias, that, of, an, intense, illogical, or, abnormal, fear, of, a, specified, thing, homophobia, manifests, in, different, forms, and, a, number, of, different, types, have, been, postulated, among, which, are, internalized, homophobia, social, homophobia, emotional, homophobia, rationalized, homophobia, and, others, there, were, also, ideas, to, classify, homophobia, and, other, types, of, bigotry, as, intolerant, personality, disorder, in, 1992, the, american, psychiatric, association, recognizing, the, power, of, the, stigma, against, homosexuality, issued, the, following, statement, reaffirmed, by, the, board, of, trustees, july, 2011, whereas, homosexuality, per, se, implies, no, impairment, in, judgment, stability, reliability, or, general, social, or, vocational, capabilities, the, american, psychiatric, association, apa, calls, on, all, international, health, organizations, psychiatric, organizations, and, individual, psychiatrists, in, other, countries, to, urge, the, repeal, in, their, own, countries, of, legislation, that, penalizes, homosexual, acts, by, consenting, adults, in, private, further, apa, calls, on, these, organizations, and, individuals, to, do, all, that, is, possible, to, decrease, the, stigma, related, to, homosexuality, wherever, and, whenever, it, may, occur, some, world, religions, contain, anti, homosexual, teachings, while, other, religions, have, varying, degrees, of, ambivalence, neutrality, or, incorporate, teachings, that, regard, homosexuals, as, third, gender, even, within, some, religions, which, generally, discourage, homosexuality, there, may, also, be, people, who, view, homosexuality, positively, and, some, religious, denominations, bless, or, conduct, same, sex, marriages, there, also, exist, so, called, queer, religions, dedicated, to, serving, the, spiritual, needs, of, lgbtqi, persons, queer, theology, seeks, to, provide, a, counterpoint, to, religious, homophobia, in, 2015, attorney, and, author, roberta, kaplan, stated, that, kim, davis, is, the, clearest, example, of, someone, who, wants, to, use, a, religious, liberty, argument, to, discriminate, passages, commonly, interpreted, as, condemning, homosexuality, or, same, gender, sexual, relations, are, found, in, both, old, and, new, testaments, of, the, bible, leviticus, 18, 22, says, thou, shalt, not, lie, with, mankind, as, with, womankind, it, is, abomination, the, destruction, of, sodom, and, gomorrah, is, also, commonly, seen, as, a, condemnation, of, homosexuality, christians, and, jews, who, oppose, homosexuality, may, often, cite, such, passages, the, historical, context, and, interpretation, of, which, is, more, complicated, scholarly, debate, over, the, interpretation, of, these, passages, has, tended, to, focus, on, placing, them, in, proper, historical, context, for, instance, pointing, out, that, sodom, s, sins, are, historically, interpreted, as, being, other, than, homosexuality, and, on, the, translation, of, rare, or, unusual, words, in, the, passages, in, question, in, religion, dispatches, magazine, candace, chellew, hodge, argues, that, the, six, or, so, verses, that, are, often, cited, to, condemn, lgbt, people, are, referring, instead, to, abusive, sex, she, states, that, the, bible, has, no, condemnation, for, loving, committed, gay, and, lesbian, relationships, and, that, jesus, was, silent, on, the, subject, this, view, is, opposed, by, a, number, of, conservative, evangelicals, including, robert, a, j, gagnon, the, official, teaching, of, the, catholic, church, regarding, homosexuality, is, that, same, sex, behavior, should, not, be, expressed, in, the, united, states, a, february, 2012, pew, research, center, poll, shows, that, catholics, support, gay, marriage, by, a, margin, of, 52, to, 37, that, is, a, shift, upwards, from, 2010, when, 46, of, catholics, favored, gay, marriage, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, that, homosexual, acts, are, intrinsically, disordered, they, are, contrary, to, the, natural, law, under, no, circumstances, can, they, be, approved, in, some, cases, the, distinction, between, religious, homophobia, and, state, sponsored, homophobia, is, not, clear, a, key, example, being, territories, under, islamic, authority, all, major, islamic, sects, forbid, homosexuality, which, is, a, crime, under, sharia, law, and, treated, as, such, in, most, muslim, countries, in, afghanistan, for, instance, homosexuality, carried, the, death, penalty, under, the, taliban, after, their, fall, homosexuality, was, reduced, from, a, capital, crime, to, one, that, is, punished, with, fines, and, prison, sentences, after, the, revolution, of, 1979, in, iran, and, the, establishment, of, a, new, government, based, on, islamic, sharia, the, pressure, and, punishment, against, lgbt, people, has, expanded, in, this, country, the, legal, situation, in, the, united, arab, emirates, however, is, unclear, in, 2009, the, international, lesbian, and, gay, association, ilga, published, a, report, entitled, state, sponsored, homophobia, 2009, which, is, based, on, research, carried, out, by, daniel, ottosson, at, s, dert, rn, university, college, stockholm, sweden, this, research, found, that, of, the, 80, countries, around, the, world, that, continue, to, consider, homosexuality, illegal, in, 2001, al, muhajiroun, an, international, organization, seeking, the, establishment, of, a, global, islamic, caliphate, issued, a, fatwa, declaring, that, all, members, of, the, al, fatiha, foundation, which, advances, the, cause, of, gay, lesbian, and, transgender, muslims, were, murtadd, or, apostates, and, condemning, them, to, death, because, of, the, threat, and, because, they, come, from, conservative, societies, many, members, of, the, foundation, s, site, still, prefer, to, be, anonymous, so, as, to, protect, their, identities, while, they, are, continuing, a, tradition, of, secrecy, in, some, regions, gay, people, have, been, persecuted, and, murdered, by, islamist, militias, such, as, al, nusra, front, and, isil, in, parts, of, iraq, and, syria, state, sponsored, homophobia, includes, the, criminalization, and, penalization, of, homosexuality, hate, speech, from, government, figures, and, other, forms, of, discrimination, violence, persecution, of, lgbt, people, in, medieval, europe, homosexuality, was, considered, sodomy, and, was, punishable, by, death, persecutions, reached, their, height, during, the, medieval, inquisitions, when, the, sects, of, cathars, and, waldensians, were, accused, of, fornication, and, sodomy, alongside, accusations, of, satanism, in, 1307, accusations, of, sodomy, and, homosexuality, were, major, charges, leveled, during, the, trial, of, the, knights, templar, the, theologian, thomas, aquinas, was, influential, in, linking, condemnation, of, homosexuality, with, the, idea, of, natural, law, arguing, that, special, sins, are, against, nature, as, for, instance, those, that, run, counter, to, the, intercourse, of, male, and, female, natural, to, animals, and, so, are, peculiarly, qualified, as, unnatural, vices, although, bisexuality, was, accepted, as, normal, human, behavior, in, ancient, china, homophobia, became, ingrained, in, the, late, qing, dynasty, and, the, republic, of, china, due, to, interactions, with, the, christian, west, and, homosexual, behavior, was, outlawed, in, 1740, during, the, cultural, revolution, homosexuality, was, treated, by, the, government, as, a, social, disgrace, or, a, form, of, mental, illness, and, individuals, who, were, homosexual, widely, faced, persecution, although, there, were, no, laws, specifically, against, homosexuality, other, laws, were, used, to, prosecute, homosexual, people, and, they, were, charged, with, hooliganism, or, disturbing, public, order, the, soviet, union, under, vladimir, lenin, decriminalized, homosexuality, in, 1922, long, before, many, other, european, countries, the, soviet, communist, party, effectively, legalized, no, fault, divorce, abortion, and, homosexuality, when, they, abolished, all, the, old, tsarist, laws, and, the, initial, soviet, criminal, code, kept, these, liberal, sexual, policies, in, place, lenin, s, emancipation, was, reversed, a, decade, later, by, joseph, stalin, and, homosexuality, remained, illegal, under, article, 121, until, the, yeltsin, era, in, nazi, germany, gay, men, were, persecuted, and, approximately, five, to, fifteen, thousand, were, imprisoned, in, nazi, concentration, camps, homosexuality, is, illegal, in, 74, countries, the, north, korean, government, condemns, western, gay, culture, as, a, vice, caused, by, the, decadence, of, a, capitalist, society, and, it, denounces, it, as, promoting, consumerism, classism, and, promiscuity, in, north, korea, violating, the, rules, of, collective, socialist, life, can, be, punished, with, up, to, two, years, imprisonment, however, according, to, the, north, korean, government, as, a, country, that, has, embraced, science, and, rationalism, the, dprk, recognizes, that, many, individuals, are, born, with, homosexuality, as, a, genetic, trait, and, treats, them, with, due, respect, homosexuals, in, the, dprk, have, never, been, subject, to, repression, as, in, many, capitalist, regimes, around, the, world, robert, mugabe, the, former, president, of, zimbabwe, waged, a, violent, campaign, against, lgbt, people, arguing, that, before, colonisation, zimbabweans, did, not, engage, in, homosexual, acts, his, first, major, public, condemnation, of, homosexuality, was, in, august, 1995, during, the, zimbabwe, international, book, fair, he, told, an, audience, if, you, see, people, parading, themselves, as, lesbians, and, gays, arrest, them, and, hand, them, over, to, the, police, in, september, 1995, zimbabwe, s, parliament, introduced, legislation, banning, homosexual, acts, in, 1997, a, court, found, canaan, banana, mugabe, s, predecessor, and, the, first, president, of, zimbabwe, guilty, of, 11, counts, of, sodomy, and, indecent, assault, in, poland, local, towns, cities, and, voivodeship, sejmiks, have, declared, their, respective, regions, as, lgbt, ideology, free, zone, with, the, encouragement, of, the, ruling, law, and, justice, party, since, 2006, under, vladimir, putin, regions, in, russia, have, enacted, varying, laws, restricting, the, distribution, of, materials, promoting, lgbt, relationships, to, minors, in, june, 2013, a, federal, law, criminalizing, the, distribution, of, materials, among, minors, in, support, of, non, traditional, sexual, relationships, was, enacted, as, an, amendment, to, an, existing, child, protection, law, the, law, resulted, in, the, numerous, arrests, of, russian, lgbt, citizens, in, 2023, the, russian, supreme, court, declared, that, the, international, lgbt, rights, movement, is, an, extremist, organization, internalized, homophobia, refers, to, negative, stereotypes, beliefs, stigma, and, prejudice, about, homosexuality, and, lgbt, people, that, a, person, with, same, sex, attraction, turns, inward, on, themselves, whether, or, not, they, identify, as, lgbt, some, studies, have, shown, that, people, who, are, homophobic, are, more, likely, to, have, repressed, homosexual, desires, in, 1996, a, controlled, study, of, 64, heterosexual, men, half, said, they, were, homophobic, by, experience, with, self, reported, orientation, at, the, university, of, georgia, found, that, men, who, were, found, to, be, homophobic, as, measured, by, the, index, of, homophobia, were, considerably, more, likely, to, experience, more, erectile, responses, when, exposed, to, homoerotic, images, than, non, homophobic, men, weinstein, and, colleagues, arrived, at, similar, results, when, researchers, found, that, students, who, came, from, controlling, and, homophobic, homes, were, most, likely, to, reveal, repressed, homosexual, attraction, the, researchers, said, that, this, explained, why, some, religious, leaders, who, denounce, homosexuality, are, later, revealed, to, have, secret, homosexual, relations, one, co, author, said, in, many, cases, these, are, people, who, are, at, war, with, themselves, and, they, are, turning, this, internal, conflict, outward, a, 2016, eye, tracking, study, showed, that, heterosexual, men, with, high, negative, impulse, reactions, toward, homosexuals, gazed, for, longer, periods, at, homosexual, imagery, than, other, heterosexual, men, according, to, cheval, et, al, 2016, these, findings, reinforce, the, necessity, to, consider, that, homophobia, might, reflect, concerns, about, sexuality, in, general, and, not, homosexuality, in, particular, in, contrast, jesse, marczyk, argued, in, psychology, today, that, homophobia, is, not, necessarily, repressed, homosexuality, the, effect, of, these, ideas, depends, on, how, much, and, which, they, have, consciously, and, subconsciously, internalized, these, negative, beliefs, can, be, mitigated, with, education, life, experience, and, therapy, especially, with, gay, friendly, psychotherapy, analysis, internalized, homophobia, also, applies, to, conscious, or, unconscious, behaviors, which, a, person, feels, the, need, to, promote, or, conform, to, cultural, expectations, of, heteronormativity, or, heterosexism, this, can, include, repression, and, denial, coupled, with, forced, outward, displays, of, heteronormative, behavior, for, the, purpose, of, appearing, or, attempting, to, feel, normal, or, accepted, other, expressions, of, internalized, homophobia, can, also, be, subtle, some, less, overt, behaviors, may, include, making, assumptions, about, the, gender, of, a, person, s, romantic, partner, or, about, gender, roles, some, researchers, also, apply, this, label, to, lgbt, people, who, support, compromise, policies, such, as, those, that, find, civil, unions, acceptable, in, place, of, same, sex, marriage, researcher, iain, r, williamson, finds, the, term, homophobia, to, be, highly, problematic, but, for, reasons, of, continuity, and, consistency, with, the, majority, of, other, publications, on, the, issue, retains, its, use, rather, than, using, more, accurate, but, obscure, terminology, the, phrase, internalized, sexual, stigma, is, sometimes, used, in, place, to, represent, internalized, homophobia, an, internalized, stigma, arises, when, a, person, believes, negative, stereotypes, about, themselves, regardless, of, where, the, stereotypes, come, from, it, can, also, refer, to, many, stereotypes, beyond, sexuality, and, gender, roles, internalized, homophobia, can, cause, discomfort, with, and, disapproval, of, one, s, own, sexual, orientation, ego, dystonic, sexual, orientation, or, egodystonic, homophobia, for, instance, is, a, condition, characterized, by, having, a, sexual, orientation, or, an, attraction, that, is, at, odds, with, one, s, idealized, self, image, causing, anxiety, and, a, desire, to, change, one, s, orientation, or, become, more, comfortable, with, one, s, sexual, orientation, such, a, situation, may, cause, extreme, repression, of, homosexual, desires, in, other, cases, a, conscious, internal, struggle, may, occur, for, some, time, often, pitting, deeply, held, religious, or, social, beliefs, against, strong, sexual, and, emotional, desires, this, discordance, can, cause, clinical, depression, and, a, higher, rate, of, suicide, among, lgbt, youth, up, to, 30, percent, of, non, heterosexual, youth, attempt, suicide, has, been, attributed, to, this, phenomenon, psychotherapy, such, as, gay, affirmative, psychotherapy, and, participation, in, a, sexual, minority, affirming, group, can, help, resolve, the, internal, conflicts, such, as, between, religious, beliefs, and, sexual, identity, even, informal, therapies, that, address, understanding, and, accepting, of, non, heterosexual, orientations, can, prove, effective, many, diagnostic, internalized, homophobia, scales, can, be, used, to, measure, a, person, s, discomfort, with, their, sexuality, and, some, can, be, used, by, people, regardless, of, gender, or, sexual, orientation, critics, of, the, scales, note, that, they, presume, a, discomfort, with, non, heterosexuality, which, in, itself, enforces, heternormativity, the, fear, of, being, identified, as, gay, can, be, considered, as, a, form, of, social, homophobia, theorists, including, calvin, thomas, and, judith, butler, have, suggested, that, homophobia, can, be, rooted, in, an, individual, s, fear, of, being, identified, as, gay, homophobia, in, men, is, correlated, with, insecurity, about, masculinity, for, this, reason, homophobia, is, allegedly, rampant, in, sports, and, in, the, subculture, of, its, supporters, that, is, considered, stereotypically, male, such, as, association, football, and, rugby, nancy, j, chodorow, states, that, homophobia, can, be, viewed, as, a, method, of, protection, of, male, masculinity, various, psychoanalytic, theories, explain, homophobia, as, a, threat, to, an, individual, s, own, same, sex, impulses, whether, those, impulses, are, imminent, or, merely, hypothetical, this, threat, causes, repression, denial, or, reaction, formation, homophobia, is, not, evenly, distributed, throughout, society, but, is, more, or, less, pronounced, according, to, ethnicity, age, geographic, location, race, sex, social, class, education, partisan, identification, and, religion, according, to, uk, hiv, aids, charity, avert, religious, views, lack, of, homosexual, feelings, or, experiences, and, lack, of, interaction, with, gay, people, are, strongly, associated, with, such, views, the, anxiety, of, heterosexual, individuals, particularly, adolescents, whose, construction, of, heterosexual, masculinity, is, based, in, part, on, not, being, seen, as, gay, that, others, may, identify, them, as, gay, has, also, been, identified, by, michael, kimmel, as, an, example, of, homophobia, the, taunting, of, boys, seen, as, eccentric, and, who, are, not, usually, gay, is, said, to, be, endemic, in, rural, and, suburban, american, schools, and, has, been, associated, with, risk, taking, behavior, and, outbursts, of, violence, such, as, a, spate, of, school, shootings, by, boys, seeking, revenge, or, trying, to, assert, their, masculinity, homophobic, bullying, is, also, very, common, in, schools, in, the, united, kingdom, at, least, 445, lgbt, brazilians, were, either, murdered, or, committed, suicide, in, 2017, in, some, cases, the, works, of, authors, who, merely, have, the, word, gay, in, their, name, gay, talese, peter, gay, or, works, about, things, also, contain, the, name, enola, gay, have, been, destroyed, because, of, a, perceived, pro, homosexual, bias, in, the, united, states, attitudes, vary, on, the, basis, of, partisan, identification, republicans, are, far, more, likely, than, democrats, to, have, negative, attitudes, about, gays, and, lesbians, according, to, surveys, conducted, by, the, national, election, studies, from, 2000, through, 2004, homophobia, also, varies, by, region, statistics, show, that, the, southern, united, states, has, more, reports, of, anti, gay, prejudice, than, any, other, region, in, the, us, in, a, 1998, address, civil, rights, leader, coretta, scott, king, stated, homophobia, is, like, racism, and, anti, semitism, and, other, forms, of, bigotry, in, that, it, seeks, to, dehumanize, a, large, group, of, people, to, deny, their, humanity, their, dignity, and, personhood, one, study, of, white, adolescent, males, conducted, at, the, university, of, cincinnati, by, janet, baker, has, been, used, to, argue, that, negative, feelings, towards, gay, people, are, also, associated, with, other, discriminatory, behaviors, according, to, the, study, hatred, of, gay, people, antisemitism, and, racism, are, likely, companions, baker, hypothesized, maybe, it, s, a, matter, of, power, and, looking, down, on, all, you, think, are, at, the, bottom, a, study, performed, in, 2007, in, the, uk, for, the, charity, stonewall, reports, that, up, to, 90, percent, of, the, population, support, anti, discrimination, laws, protecting, gay, and, lesbian, people, there, are, at, least, two, studies, which, indicate, that, homophobia, may, have, a, negative, economic, impact, for, the, countries, where, it, is, widespread, in, these, countries, there, is, a, flight, of, their, lgbt, populations, with, the, consequent, loss, of, talent, as, well, as, an, avoidance, of, lgbt, tourism, that, leaves, the, pink, money, in, lgbt, friendlier, countries, as, an, example, lgbt, tourists, contribute, 6, 8, billion, dollars, every, year, to, the, spanish, economy, as, soon, as, 2005, an, editorial, from, the, new, york, times, related, the, politics, of, don, t, ask, don, t, tell, in, the, us, army, with, the, lack, of, translators, from, arabic, and, with, the, delay, in, the, translation, of, arabic, documents, calculated, to, be, about, 120, 000, hours, at, the, time, since, 1998, with, the, introduction, of, the, new, policy, about, 20, arabic, translators, had, been, expelled, from, the, army, specifically, during, the, years, the, us, was, involved, in, wars, in, iraq, and, afghanistan, m, v, lee, badgett, an, economist, at, the, university, of, massachusetts, amherst, presented, in, march, 2014, in, a, meeting, of, the, world, bank, the, results, of, a, study, about, the, economic, impact, of, homophobia, in, india, only, in, health, expenses, caused, by, depression, suicide, and, hiv, treatment, india, would, have, spent, additional, 23, 100, million, dollars, due, to, homophobia, on, top, there, would, be, costs, caused, by, violence, workplace, loss, rejection, of, the, family, and, bullying, at, school, that, would, result, in, a, lower, education, level, lower, productivity, lower, wages, worse, health, and, a, lower, life, expectancy, among, the, lgbt, population, in, total, she, estimated, for, 2014, in, india, a, loss, of, up, to, 30, 800, million, dollars, or, 1, 7, of, the, indian, gdp, the, lgbt, activist, adebisi, alimi, in, a, preliminary, estimation, has, calculated, that, the, economic, loss, due, to, homophobia, in, nigeria, is,

effects, on, that, class, of, people, warren, j, blumenfeld, argues, that, this, emotion, gains, a, dimension, beyond, itself, as, a, tool, for, extreme, right, wing, conservatives, and, fundamentalist, religious, groups, and, as, a, restricting, factor, on, gender, relations, as, to, the, weight, associated, with, performing, each, role, accordingly, furthermore, blumenfeld, in, particular, stated, anti, gay, bias, causes, young, people, to, engage, in, sexual, behavior, earlier, in, order, to, prove, that, they, are, straight, anti, gay, bias, contributed, significantly, to,

elena, delavega, argued, in, a, 2016, article, published, in, the, journal, of, homosexuality, that, homophobia, could, be, reduced, through, exposure, learning, about, lgbt, experiences, explanation, understanding, the, different, challenges, faced, by, lgbt, people, and, experience, putting, themselves, in, situations, experienced, by, lgbt, people, by, working, alongside, lgbt, co, workers, or, volunteering, at, an, lgbt, community, center, researchers, have, proposed, alternative, terms, to, describe, prejudice, and, discrimination, against, lgbt, people, some, of, these, alternatives, show, more, semantic, transparency, while, others, do, not, include, phobia, use, of, homophobia, homophobic, and, homophobe, has, been, criticized, as, pejorative, against, lgbt, rights, opponents, behavioral, scientists, william, o, donohue, and, christine, caselles, stated, in, 1993, that, as, is, usually, used, makes, an, illegitimately, pejorative, evaluation, of, certain, open, and, debatable, value, positions, much, like, the, former, disease, construct, of, homosexuality, itself, arguing, that, the, term, may, be, used, as, an, ad, hominem, argument, against, those, who, advocate, values, or, positions, of, which, the, user, does, not, approve, psychologists, gregory, m, herek, and, beverly, a, greene, also, find, fault, with, the, term, homophobia, technically, homophobia, means, fear, of, sameness, yet, its, usage, implies, a, fear, of, homosexuals, the, phobia, suffix, implies, a, specific, kind, of, fear, fear, or, aversion, may, comprise, one, component, of, beliefs, about, homosexuality, but, other, factors, are, unquestionably, important, several, alternative, terms, have, been, offered, these, include, homonegativism, hudson, ricketts, 1980, homosexism, hansen, 1982, and, heterosexism, herek, 1986a, unfortunately, none, has, gained, widespread, acceptance, however, neutral, use, of, the, term, has, gained, acceptance, and, usage, over, time, since, the, 1990s, in, 2017, the, associated, press, stylebook, added, an, entry, for, homophobia, and, homophobic, for, the, first, time, after, having, excluded, it, in, 2012, the, entry, says, the, terms, are, acceptable, in, broad, references, or, in, quotations, to, the, concept, of, fear, or, hatred, of, gays, lesbians, and, bisexuals, the, term, heterophobia, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, reverse, discrimination, towards, heterosexuals, the, scientific, use, of, heterophobia, in, sexology, is, restricted, to, a, few, researchers, who, question, alfred, kinsey, s, sex, research, to, date, the, existence, or, extent, of, heterophobia, is, mostly, unrecognized, by, sexologists, beyond, sexology, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, the, meaning, of, the, term, because, it, is, also, used, to, mean, fear, of, the, opposite, such, as, in, pierre, andr, taguieff, s, the, force, of, prejudice, on, racism, and, its, doubles, 2001, referring, to, the, debate, on, both, meaning, and, use, suny, lecturer, raymond, j, noonan, stated, the, term, heterophobia, is, confusing, for, some, people, for, several, reasons, on, the, one, hand, some, look, at, it, as, just, another, of, the, many, me, too, social, constructions, that, have, arisen, in, the, pseudoscience, of, victimology, in, recent, decades, many, of, us, recall, john, money, s, 1995, criticism, of, the, ascendancy, of, victimology, and, its, negative, impact, on, sexual, science, others, look, at, the, parallelism, between, heterophobia, and, homophobia, and, suggest, that, the, former, trivializes, the, latter, for, others, it, is, merely, a, curiosity, or, parallel, construction, word, game, but, for, others, still, it, is, part, of, both, the, recognition, and, politicization, of, heterosexuals, cultural, interests, in, contrast, to, those, of, gays, particularly, where, those, interests, are, perceived, to, clash, stephen, m, white, and, louis, r, franzini, introduced, the, related, term, heteronegativism, to, refer, to, the, range, of, negative, feelings, that, some, gay, individuals, may, hold, toward, heterosexuals, this, term, is, preferred, to, heterophobia, because, it, does, not, imply, extreme, or, irrational, fear, the, merriam, webster, dictionary, of, the, english, language, defines, heterophobia, as, irrational, fear, of, aversion, to, or, discrimination, against, heterosexual, people
