https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture
nature, versus, nurture, is, a, long, standing, debate, in, biology, and, society, about, the, relative, influence, on, human, beings, of, their, genetic, inheritance, nature, and, the, environmental, conditions, of, their, development, nurture, the, alliterative, expression, nature, and, nurture, in, english, has, been, in, use, since, at, least, the, elizabethan, period, and, goes, back, to, medieval, french, the, complementary, combination, of, the, two, concepts, is, an, ancient, concept, ancient, greek, nature, is, what, people, think, of, as, pre, wiring, and, is, influenced, by, genetic, inheritance, and, other, biological, factors, nurture, is, generally, taken, as, the, influence, of, external, factors, after, conception, e, g, the, product, of, exposure, experience, and, learning, on, an, individual, the, phrase, in, its, modern, sense, was, popularized, by, the, victorian, polymath, francis, galton, the, modern, founder, of, eugenics, and, behavioral, genetics, when, he, was, discussing, the, influence, of, heredity, and, environment, on, social, advancement, galton, was, influenced, by, on, the, origin, of, species, written, by, his, half, cousin, the, evolutionary, biologist, charles, darwin, the, view, that, humans, acquire, all, or, almost, all, their, behavioral, traits, from, nurture, was, termed, tabula, rasa, blank, tablet, slate, by, john, locke, in, 1690, a, blank, slate, view, sometimes, termed, blank, slatism, in, human, developmental, psychology, which, assumes, that, human, behavioral, traits, develop, almost, exclusively, from, environmental, influences, was, widely, held, during, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, debate, between, blank, slate, denial, of, the, influence, of, heritability, and, the, view, admitting, both, environmental, and, heritable, traits, has, often, been, cast, in, terms, of, nature, versus, nurture, these, two, conflicting, approaches, to, human, development, were, at, the, core, of, an, ideological, dispute, over, research, agendas, throughout, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, both, nature, and, nurture, factors, were, found, to, contribute, substantially, often, in, an, inextricable, manner, such, views, were, seen, as, naive, or, outdated, by, most, scholars, of, human, development, by, the, 21st, century, the, strong, dichotomy, of, nature, versus, nurture, has, thus, been, claimed, to, have, limited, relevance, in, some, fields, of, research, close, feedback, loops, have, been, found, in, which, nature, and, nurture, influence, one, another, constantly, as, seen, in, self, domestication, in, ecology, and, behavioral, genetics, researchers, think, nurture, has, an, essential, influence, on, the, nature, of, an, individual, similarly, in, other, fields, the, dividing, line, between, an, inherited, and, an, acquired, trait, becomes, unclear, as, in, epigenetics, or, fetal, development, according, to, records, of, the, grand, historian, 94, bc, by, sima, qian, during, chen, sheng, wu, guang, uprising, in, 209, b, c, chen, sheng, asked, the, rhetorical, question, as, a, call, to, war, are, kings, generals, and, ministers, merely, born, into, their, kind, chinese, though, chen, was, obviously, negative, to, the, question, the, phrase, has, often, been, cited, as, an, early, quest, to, the, nature, versus, nurture, problem, john, locke, s, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1690, is, often, cited, as, the, foundational, document, of, the, blank, slate, view, in, the, essay, locke, specifically, criticizes, ren, descartes, s, claim, of, an, innate, idea, of, god, that, is, universal, to, humanity, locke, s, view, was, harshly, criticized, in, his, own, time, anthony, ashley, cooper, 3rd, earl, of, shaftesbury, complained, that, by, denying, the, possibility, of, any, innate, ideas, locke, threw, all, order, and, virtue, out, of, the, world, leading, to, total, moral, relativism, by, the, 19th, century, the, predominant, perspective, was, contrary, to, that, of, locke, s, tending, to, focus, on, instinct, leda, cosmides, and, john, tooby, noted, that, william, james, 1842, 1910, argued, that, humans, have, more, instincts, than, animals, and, that, greater, freedom, of, action, is, the, result, of, having, more, psychological, instincts, not, fewer, the, question, of, innate, ideas, or, instincts, were, of, some, importance, in, the, discussion, of, free, will, in, moral, philosophy, in, 18th, century, philosophy, this, was, cast, in, terms, of, innate, ideas, establishing, the, presence, of, a, universal, virtue, prerequisite, for, objective, morals, in, the, 20th, century, this, argument, was, in, a, way, inverted, since, some, philosophers, j, l, mackie, now, argued, that, the, evolutionary, origins, of, human, behavioral, traits, forces, us, to, concede, that, there, is, no, foundation, for, ethics, while, others, thomas, nagel, treated, ethics, as, a, field, of, cognitively, valid, statements, in, complete, isolation, from, evolutionary, considerations, in, the, early, 20th, century, there, was, an, increased, interest, in, the, role, of, one, s, environment, as, a, reaction, to, the, strong, focus, on, pure, heredity, in, the, wake, of, the, triumphal, success, of, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, during, this, time, the, social, sciences, developed, as, the, project, of, studying, the, influence, of, culture, in, clean, isolation, from, questions, related, to, biology, franz, boas, s, the, mind, of, primitive, man, 1911, established, a, program, that, would, dominate, american, anthropology, for, the, next, 15, years, in, this, study, he, established, that, in, any, given, population, biology, language, material, and, symbolic, culture, are, autonomous, that, each, is, an, equally, important, dimension, of, human, nature, but, that, none, of, these, dimensions, is, reducible, to, another, john, b, watson, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, established, the, school, of, purist, behaviorism, that, would, become, dominant, over, the, following, decades, watson, is, often, said, to, have, been, convinced, of, the, complete, dominance, of, cultural, influence, over, anything, that, heredity, might, contribute, this, is, based, on, the, following, quote, which, is, frequently, repeated, without, context, as, the, last, sentence, is, frequently, omitted, leading, to, confusion, about, watson, s, position, give, me, a, dozen, healthy, infants, well, formed, and, my, own, specified, world, to, bring, them, up, in, and, i, ll, guarantee, to, take, any, one, at, random, and, train, him, to, become, any, type, of, specialist, i, might, select, doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant, chief, and, yes, even, beggar, man, and, thief, regardless, of, his, talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and, race, of, his, ancestors, i, am, going, beyond, my, facts, and, i, admit, it, but, so, have, the, advocates, of, the, contrary, and, they, have, been, doing, it, for, many, thousands, of, years, during, the, 1940s, to, 1960s, ashley, montagu, was, a, notable, proponent, of, this, purist, form, of, behaviorism, which, allowed, no, contribution, from, heredity, whatsoever, man, is, man, because, he, has, no, instincts, because, everything, he, is, and, has, become, he, has, learned, acquired, from, his, culture, with, the, exception, of, the, instinctoid, reactions, in, infants, to, sudden, withdrawals, of, support, and, to, sudden, loud, noises, the, human, being, is, entirely, instinctless, in, 1951, calvin, hall, suggested, that, the, dichotomy, opposing, nature, to, nurture, is, ultimately, fruitless, in, african, genesis, 1961, and, the, territorial, imperative, 1966, robert, ardrey, argues, for, innate, attributes, of, human, nature, especially, concerning, territoriality, desmond, morris, in, the, naked, ape, 1967, expresses, similar, views, organised, opposition, to, montagu, s, kind, of, purist, blank, slatism, began, to, pick, up, in, the, 1970s, notably, led, by, e, o, wilson, on, human, nature, 1979, the, tool, of, twin, studies, was, developed, as, a, research, design, intended, to, exclude, all, confounders, based, on, inherited, behavioral, traits, such, studies, are, designed, to, decompose, the, variability, of, a, given, trait, in, a, given, population, into, a, genetic, and, an, environmental, component, twin, studies, established, that, there, was, in, many, cases, a, significant, heritable, component, these, results, did, not, in, any, way, point, to, overwhelming, contribution, of, heritable, factors, with, heritability, typically, ranging, around, 40, to, 50, so, that, the, controversy, may, not, be, cast, in, terms, of, purist, behaviorism, vs, purist, nativism, rather, it, was, purist, behaviorism, that, was, gradually, replaced, by, the, now, predominant, view, that, both, kinds, of, factors, usually, contribute, to, a, given, trait, anecdotally, phrased, by, donald, hebb, as, an, answer, to, the, question, which, nature, or, nurture, contributes, more, to, personality, by, asking, in, response, which, contributes, more, to, the, area, of, a, rectangle, its, length, or, its, width, in, a, comparable, avenue, of, research, anthropologist, donald, brown, in, the, 1980s, surveyed, hundreds, of, anthropological, studies, from, around, the, world, and, collected, a, set, of, cultural, universals, he, identified, approximately, 150, such, features, coming, to, the, conclusion, there, is, indeed, a, universal, human, nature, and, that, these, features, point, to, what, that, universal, human, nature, is, at, the, height, of, the, controversy, during, the, 1970s, to, 1980s, the, debate, was, highly, ideologised, in, not, in, our, genes, biology, ideology, and, human, nature, 1984, richard, lewontin, steven, rose, and, leon, kamin, criticise, genetic, determinism, from, a, marxist, framework, arguing, that, science, is, the, ultimate, legitimator, of, bourgeois, ideology, if, biological, determinism, is, a, weapon, in, the, struggle, between, classes, then, the, universities, are, weapons, factories, and, their, teaching, and, research, faculties, are, the, engineers, designers, and, production, workers, the, debate, thus, shifted, away, from, whether, heritable, traits, exist, to, whether, it, was, politically, or, ethically, permissible, to, admit, their, existence, the, authors, deny, this, requesting, that, evolutionary, inclinations, be, discarded, in, ethical, and, political, discussions, regardless, of, whether, they, exist, or, not, heritability, studies, became, much, easier, to, perform, and, hence, much, more, numerous, with, the, advances, of, genetic, studies, during, the, 1990s, by, the, late, 1990s, an, overwhelming, amount, of, evidence, had, accumulated, that, amounts, to, a, refutation, of, the, extreme, forms, of, blank, slatism, advocated, by, watson, or, montagu, this, revised, state, of, affairs, was, summarized, in, books, aimed, at, a, popular, audience, from, the, late, 1990s, in, the, nurture, assumption, why, children, turn, out, the, way, they, do, 1998, judith, rich, harris, was, heralded, by, steven, pinker, as, a, book, that, will, come, to, be, seen, as, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, psychology, however, harris, was, criticized, for, exaggerating, the, point, of, parental, upbringing, seems, to, matter, less, than, previously, thought, to, the, implication, that, parents, do, not, matter, the, situation, as, it, presented, itself, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, was, summarized, in, the, blank, slate, the, modern, denial, of, human, nature, 2002, by, steven, pinker, the, book, became, a, best, seller, and, was, instrumental, in, bringing, to, the, attention, of, a, wider, public, the, paradigm, shift, away, from, the, behaviourist, purism, of, the, 1940s, to, 1970s, that, had, taken, place, over, the, preceding, decades, pinker, portrays, the, adherence, to, pure, blank, slatism, as, an, ideological, dogma, linked, to, two, other, dogmas, found, in, the, dominant, view, of, human, nature, in, the, 20th, century, pinker, argues, that, all, three, dogmas, were, held, onto, for, an, extended, period, even, in, the, face, of, evidence, because, they, were, seen, as, desirable, in, the, sense, that, if, any, human, trait, is, purely, conditioned, by, culture, any, undesired, trait, such, as, crime, or, aggression, may, be, engineered, away, by, purely, cultural, political, means, pinker, focuses, on, reasons, he, assumes, were, responsible, for, unduly, repressing, evidence, to, the, contrary, notably, the, fear, of, imagined, or, projected, political, or, ideological, consequences, the, term, heritability, refers, only, to, the, degree, of, genetic, variation, between, people, on, a, trait, it, does, not, refer, to, the, degree, to, which, a, trait, of, a, particular, individual, is, due, to, environmental, or, genetic, factors, the, traits, of, an, individual, are, always, a, complex, interweaving, of, both, for, an, individual, even, strongly, genetically, influenced, or, obligate, traits, such, as, eye, color, assume, the, inputs, of, a, typical, environment, during, ontogenetic, development, e, g, certain, ranges, of, temperatures, oxygen, levels, etc, in, contrast, the, heritability, index, statistically, quantifies, the, extent, to, which, variation, between, individuals, on, a, trait, is, due, to, variation, in, the, genes, those, individuals, carry, in, animals, where, breeding, and, environments, can, be, controlled, experimentally, heritability, can, be, determined, relatively, easily, such, experiments, would, be, unethical, for, human, research, this, problem, can, be, overcome, by, finding, existing, populations, of, humans, that, reflect, the, experimental, setting, the, researcher, wishes, to, create, one, way, to, determine, the, contribution, of, genes, and, environment, to, a, trait, is, to, study, twins, in, one, kind, of, study, identical, twins, reared, apart, are, compared, to, randomly, selected, pairs, of, people, the, twins, share, identical, genes, but, different, family, environments, twins, reared, apart, are, not, assigned, at, random, to, foster, or, adoptive, parents, in, another, kind, of, twin, study, identical, twins, reared, together, who, share, family, environment, and, genes, are, compared, to, fraternal, twins, reared, together, who, also, share, family, environment, but, only, share, half, their, genes, another, condition, that, permits, the, disassociation, of, genes, and, environment, is, adoption, in, one, kind, of, adoption, study, biological, siblings, reared, together, who, share, the, same, family, environment, and, half, their, genes, are, compared, to, adoptive, siblings, who, share, their, family, environment, but, none, of, their, genes, in, many, cases, it, has, been, found, that, genes, make, a, substantial, contribution, including, psychological, traits, such, as, intelligence, and, personality, yet, heritability, may, differ, in, other, circumstances, for, instance, environmental, deprivation, examples, of, low, medium, and, high, heritability, traits, include, twin, and, adoption, studies, have, their, methodological, limits, for, example, both, are, limited, to, the, range, of, environments, and, genes, which, they, sample, almost, all, of, these, studies, are, conducted, in, western, countries, and, therefore, cannot, necessarily, be, extrapolated, globally, to, include, non, western, populations, additionally, both, types, of, studies, depend, on, particular, assumptions, such, as, the, equal, environments, assumption, in, the, case, of, twin, studies, and, the, lack, of, pre, adoptive, effects, in, the, case, of, adoption, studies, since, the, definition, of, nature, in, this, context, is, tied, to, heritability, the, definition, of, nurture, has, consequently, become, very, wide, including, any, type, of, causality, that, is, not, heritable, the, term, has, thus, moved, away, from, its, original, connotation, of, cultural, influences, to, include, all, effects, of, the, environment, including, indeed, a, substantial, source, of, environmental, input, to, human, nature, may, arise, from, stochastic, variations, in, prenatal, development, and, is, thus, in, no, sense, of, the, term, cultural, many, properties, of, the, brain, are, genetically, organized, and, don, t, depend, on, information, coming, in, from, the, senses, the, interactions, of, genes, with, environment, called, gene, environment, interactions, are, another, component, of, the, nature, nurture, debate, a, classic, example, of, gene, environment, interaction, is, the, ability, of, a, diet, low, in, the, amino, acid, phenylalanine, to, partially, suppress, the, genetic, disease, phenylketonuria, yet, another, complication, to, the, nature, nurture, debate, is, the, existence, of, gene, environment, correlations, these, correlations, indicate, that, individuals, with, certain, genotypes, are, more, likely, to, find, themselves, in, certain, environments, thus, it, appears, that, genes, can, shape, the, selection, or, creation, of, environments, even, using, experiments, like, those, described, above, it, can, be, very, difficult, to, determine, convincingly, the, relative, contribution, of, genes, and, environment, the, analogy, genetics, loads, the, gun, but, environment, pulls, the, trigger, has, been, attributed, to, judith, stern, heritability, refers, to, the, origins, of, differences, between, people, individual, development, even, of, highly, heritable, traits, such, as, eye, color, depends, on, a, range, of, environmental, factors, from, the, other, genes, in, the, organism, to, physical, variables, such, as, temperature, oxygen, levels, etc, during, its, development, or, ontogenesis, the, variability, of, trait, can, be, meaningfully, spoken, of, as, being, due, in, certain, proportions, to, genetic, differences, nature, or, environments, nurture, for, highly, penetrant, mendelian, genetic, disorders, such, as, huntington, s, disease, virtually, all, the, incidence, of, the, disease, is, due, to, genetic, differences, huntington, s, animal, models, live, much, longer, or, shorter, lives, depending, on, how, they, are, cared, for, at, the, other, extreme, traits, such, as, native, language, are, environmentally, determined, linguists, have, found, that, any, child, if, capable, of, learning, a, language, at, all, can, learn, any, human, language, with, equal, facility, with, virtually, all, biological, and, psychological, traits, however, genes, and, environment, work, in, concert, communicating, back, and, forth, to, create, the, individual, at, a, molecular, level, genes, interact, with, signals, from, other, genes, and, from, the, environment, while, there, are, many, thousands, of, single, gene, locus, traits, so, called, complex, traits, are, due, to, the, additive, effects, of, many, often, hundreds, of, small, gene, effects, a, good, example, of, this, is, height, where, variance, appears, to, be, spread, across, many, hundreds, of, loci, extreme, genetic, or, environmental, conditions, can, predominate, in, rare, circumstances, if, a, child, is, born, mute, due, to, a, genetic, mutation, it, will, not, learn, to, speak, any, language, regardless, of, the, environment, similarly, someone, who, is, practically, certain, to, eventually, develop, huntington, s, disease, according, to, their, genotype, may, die, in, an, unrelated, accident, an, environmental, event, long, before, the, disease, will, manifest, itself, steven, pinker, likewise, described, several, examples, oncrete, behavioral, traits, that, patently, depend, on, content, provided, by, the, home, or, culture, which, language, one, speaks, which, religion, one, practices, which, political, party, one, supports, are, not, heritable, at, all, but, traits, that, reflect, the, underlying, talents, and, temperaments, how, proficient, with, language, a, person, is, how, religious, how, liberal, or, conservative, are, partially, heritable, when, traits, are, determined, by, a, complex, interaction, of, genotype, and, environment, it, is, possible, to, measure, the, heritability, of, a, trait, within, a, population, however, many, non, scientists, who, encounter, a, report, of, a, trait, having, a, certain, percentage, heritability, imagine, non, interactional, additive, contributions, of, genes, and, environment, to, the, trait, as, an, analogy, some, laypeople, may, think, of, the, degree, of, a, trait, being, made, up, of, two, buckets, genes, and, environment, each, able, to, hold, a, certain, capacity, of, the, trait, but, even, for, intermediate, heritabilities, a, trait, is, always, shaped, by, both, genetic, dispositions, and, the, environments, in, which, people, develop, merely, with, greater, and, lesser, plasticities, associated, with, these, heritability, measures, heritability, measures, always, refer, to, the, degree, of, variation, between, individuals, in, a, population, that, is, as, these, statistics, cannot, be, applied, at, the, level, of, the, individual, it, would, be, incorrect, to, say, that, while, the, heritability, index, of, personality, is, about, 0, 6, 60, of, one, s, personality, is, obtained, from, one, s, parents, and, 40, from, the, environment, to, help, to, understand, this, imagine, that, all, humans, were, genetic, clones, the, heritability, index, for, all, traits, would, be, zero, all, variability, between, clonal, individuals, must, be, due, to, environmental, factors, and, contrary, to, erroneous, interpretations, of, the, heritability, index, as, societies, become, more, egalitarian, everyone, has, more, similar, experiences, the, heritability, index, goes, up, as, environments, become, more, similar, variability, between, individuals, is, due, more, to, genetic, factors, one, should, also, take, into, account, the, fact, that, the, variables, of, heritability, and, environmentality, are, not, precise, and, vary, within, a, chosen, population, and, across, cultures, it, would, be, more, accurate, to, state, that, the, degree, of, heritability, and, environmentality, is, measured, in, its, reference, to, a, particular, phenotype, in, a, chosen, group, of, a, population, in, a, given, period, of, time, the, accuracy, of, the, calculations, is, further, hindered, by, the, number, of, coefficients, taken, into, consideration, age, being, one, such, variable, the, display, of, the, influence, of, heritability, and, environmentality, differs, drastically, across, age, groups, the, older, the, studied, age, is, the, more, noticeable, the, heritability, factor, becomes, the, younger, the, test, subjects, are, the, more, likely, it, is, to, show, signs, of, strong, influence, of, the, environmental, factors, for, example, one, study, found, no, statistically, significant, difference, in, self, reported, wellbeing, between, middle, aged, monozygotic, twins, separated, at, birth, and, those, reared, in, the, same, household, suggesting, that, happiness, in, middle, aged, adults, is, not, based, in, environmental, factors, related, to, family, rearing, the, same, result, was, also, found, among, middle, aged, dizygotic, twins, furthermore, there, was, significantly, more, variance, in, the, dizygotic, twins, self, reported, wellbeing, than, there, was, in, the, monozygotic, group, genetic, similarity, has, thus, been, estimated, to, account, for, around, 50, of, the, variance, in, adult, happiness, at, a, given, point, in, time, and, as, much, as, 80, of, the, variance, in, long, term, happiness, stability, other, studies, have, similarly, found, the, heritability, of, happiness, to, be, around, 0, 35, 0, 50, some, have, pointed, out, that, environmental, inputs, affect, the, expression, of, genes, this, is, one, explanation, of, how, environment, can, influence, the, extent, to, which, a, genetic, disposition, will, actually, manifest, traits, may, be, considered, to, be, adaptations, such, as, the, umbilical, cord, byproducts, of, adaptations, the, belly, button, or, due, to, random, variation, convex, or, concave, belly, button, shape, an, alternative, to, contrasting, nature, and, nurture, focuses, on, obligate, vs, facultative, adaptations, adaptations, may, be, generally, more, obligate, robust, in, the, face, of, typical, environmental, variation, or, more, facultative, sensitive, to, typical, environmental, variation, for, example, the, rewarding, sweet, taste, of, sugar, and, the, pain, of, bodily, injury, are, obligate, psychological, adaptations, typical, environmental, variability, during, development, does, not, much, affect, their, operation, on, the, other, hand, facultative, adaptations, are, somewhat, like, if, then, statements, an, example, of, a, facultative, psychological, adaptation, may, be, adult, attachment, style, the, attachment, style, of, adults, for, example, a, secure, attachment, style, the, propensity, to, develop, close, trusting, bonds, with, others, is, proposed, to, be, conditional, on, whether, an, individual, s, early, childhood, caregivers, could, be, trusted, to, provide, reliable, assistance, and, attention, an, example, of, a, facultative, physiological, adaptation, is, tanning, of, skin, on, exposure, to, sunlight, to, prevent, skin, damage, facultative, social, adaptation, have, also, been, proposed, for, example, whether, a, society, is, warlike, or, peaceful, has, been, proposed, to, be, conditional, on, how, much, collective, threat, that, society, is, experiencing, quantitative, studies, of, heritable, traits, throw, light, on, the, question, developmental, genetic, analysis, examines, the, effects, of, genes, over, the, course, of, a, human, lifespan, early, studies, of, intelligence, which, mostly, examined, young, children, found, that, heritability, measured, 40, 50, subsequent, developmental, genetic, analyses, found, that, variance, attributable, to, additive, environmental, effects, is, less, apparent, in, older, individuals, with, estimated, heritability, of, iq, increasing, in, adulthood, multivariate, genetic, analysis, examines, the, genetic, contribution, to, several, traits, that, vary, together, for, example, multivariate, genetic, analysis, has, demonstrated, that, the, genetic, determinants, of, all, specific, cognitive, abilities, e, g, memory, spatial, reasoning, processing, speed, overlap, greatly, such, that, the, genes, associated, with, any, specific, cognitive, ability, will, affect, all, others, similarly, multivariate, genetic, analysis, has, found, that, genes, that, affect, scholastic, achievement, completely, overlap, with, the, genes, that, affect, cognitive, ability, extremes, analysis, examines, the, link, between, normal, and, pathological, traits, for, example, it, is, hypothesized, that, a, given, behavioral, disorder, may, represent, an, extreme, of, a, continuous, distribution, of, a, normal, behavior, and, hence, an, extreme, of, a, continuous, distribution, of, genetic, and, environmental, variation, depression, phobias, and, reading, disabilities, have, been, examined, in, this, context, for, a, few, highly, heritable, traits, studies, have, identified, loci, associated, with, variance, in, that, trait, for, instance, in, some, individuals, with, schizophrenia, the, budding, field, of, epigenetics, has, conducted, research, showing, that, hereditable, conditions, like, schizophrenia, which, have, an, 80, hereditability, with, only, 10, of, those, who, have, inherited, the, trait, actually, displaying, schizophrenic, traits, new, research, is, showing, that, gene, expression, can, happen, in, adults, due, to, environmental, stimuli, for, example, people, with, schizophrenic, gene, have, a, genetic, predisposition, for, this, illness, but, the, gene, lays, dormant, in, most, people, however, if, introduced, to, chronic, stress, or, introducing, some, amphetamines, it, caused, the, methyl, groups, to, stick, to, hippocampi, histones, cognitive, functions, have, a, significant, genetic, component, a, 2015, meta, analysis, of, over, 14, million, twin, pairs, found, that, genetics, explained, 57, of, the, variability, in, cognitive, functions, evidence, from, behavioral, genetic, research, suggests, that, family, environmental, factors, may, have, an, effect, upon, childhood, iq, accounting, for, up, to, a, quarter, of, the, variance, the, american, psychological, association, s, report, intelligence, knowns, and, unknowns, 1995, states, that, there, is, no, doubt, that, normal, child, development, requires, a, certain, minimum, level, of, responsible, care, here, environment, is, playing, a, role, in, what, is, believed, to, be, fully, genetic, intelligence, but, it, was, found, that, severely, deprived, neglectful, or, abusive, environments, have, highly, negative, effects, on, many, aspects, of, children, s, intellect, development, beyond, that, minimum, however, the, role, of, family, experience, is, in, serious, dispute, on, the, other, hand, by, late, adolescence, this, correlation, disappears, such, that, adoptive, siblings, no, longer, have, similar, iq, scores, moreover, adoption, studies, indicate, that, by, adulthood, adoptive, siblings, are, no, more, similar, in, iq, than, strangers, iq, correlation, near, zero, while, full, siblings, show, an, iq, correlation, of, 0, 6, twin, studies, reinforce, this, pattern, monozygotic, identical, twins, raised, separately, are, highly, similar, in, iq, 0, 74, more, so, than, dizygotic, fraternal, twins, raised, together, 0, 6, and, much, more, than, adoptive, siblings, 0, 0, recent, adoption, studies, also, found, that, supportive, parents, can, have, a, positive, effect, on, the, development, of, their, children, other, studies, have, focused, on, environmental, factors, that, may, affect, iq, for, example, research, has, shown, that, factors, such, as, access, to, education, nutrition, and, social, support, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, iq, furthermore, research, has, suggested, that, certain, experiences, during, early, childhood, such, as, exposure, to, lead, or, other, environmental, toxins, can, have, a, negative, impact, on, iq, studies, have, consistently, shown, that, environmental, factors, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, iq, access, to, quality, education, has, been, found, to, have, a, positive, effect, on, iq, with, one, study, indicating, that, access, to, quality, preschool, education, had, a, lasting, impact, on, iq, scores, up, to, age, 35, malnutrition, in, early, childhood, has, been, linked, to, lower, iq, scores, later, in, life, while, supplementation, with, certain, nutrients, such, as, iron, and, iodine, has, been, shown, to, improve, iq, scores, social, support, is, also, an, important, environmental, factor, that, positively, affects, iq, with, one, study, indicating, that, children, who, received, high, levels, of, emotional, support, from, their, mothers, had, higher, iq, scores, than, those, who, received, low, levels, of, emotional, support, personality, is, a, frequently, cited, example, of, a, heritable, trait, that, has, been, studied, in, twins, and, adoptees, using, behavioral, genetic, study, designs, the, most, famous, categorical, organization, of, heritable, personality, traits, were, defined, in, the, 1970s, by, two, research, teams, led, by, paul, costa, robert, r, mccrae, and, warren, norman, lewis, goldberg, in, which, they, had, people, rate, their, personalities, on, 1000, dimensions, they, then, narrowed, these, down, into, the, big, five, factors, of, personality, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and, neuroticism, studies, have, found, that, extraversion, has, a, genetic, component, with, estimates, of, heritability, ranging, from, 30, to, 50, however, environmental, factors, such, as, parenting, style, cultural, values, and, life, experiences, can, also, shape, a, person, s, level, of, extraversion, likewise, neuroticism, has, a, genetic, component, with, estimates, of, heritability, ranging, from, 30, to, 50, environmental, factors, such, as, adverse, childhood, experiences, chronic, stress, and, cultural, values, can, also, influence, a, person, s, level, of, neuroticism, the, close, genetic, relationship, between, positive, personality, traits, and, for, example, our, happiness, traits, are, the, mirror, images, of, comorbidity, in, psychopathology, these, personality, factors, were, consistent, across, cultures, and, many, studies, have, also, tested, the, heritability, of, these, traits, personal, agency, also, factors, into, this, debate, while, genetic, and, environmental, factors, can, shape, personality, individuals, also, have, agency, in, shaping, their, own, personality, through, their, choices, behaviors, and, attitudes, for, example, one, study, found, that, college, students, who, participated, in, study, abroad, programs, scored, higher, on, measures, of, openness, to, experience, compared, to, those, who, did, not, participate, another, study, found, that, individuals, who, lived, in, diverse, neighborhoods, were, more, likely, to, score, higher, on, openness, to, experience, compared, to, those, who, lived, in, more, homogenous, neighborhoods, identical, twins, reared, apart, are, far, more, similar, in, personality, than, randomly, selected, pairs, of, people, likewise, identical, twins, are, more, similar, than, fraternal, twins, also, biological, siblings, are, more, similar, in, personality, than, adoptive, siblings, each, observation, suggests, that, personality, is, heritable, to, a, certain, extent, a, supporting, article, had, focused, on, the, heritability, of, personality, which, is, estimated, to, be, around, 50, for, subjective, well, being, in, which, a, study, was, conducted, using, a, representative, sample, of, 973, twin, pairs, to, test, the, heritable, differences, in, subjective, well, being, which, were, found, to, be, fully, accounted, for, by, the, genetic, model, of, the, five, factor, model, s, personality, domains, however, these, same, study, designs, allow, for, the, examination, of, environment, as, well, as, genes, adoption, studies, also, directly, measure, the, strength, of, shared, family, effects, adopted, siblings, share, only, family, environment, most, adoption, studies, indicate, that, by, adulthood, the, personalities, of, adopted, siblings, are, little, or, no, more, similar, than, random, pairs, of, strangers, this, would, mean, that, shared, family, effects, on, personality, are, zero, by, adulthood, in, the, case, of, personality, traits, non, shared, environmental, effects, are, often, found, to, out, weigh, shared, environmental, effects, that, is, environmental, effects, that, are, typically, thought, to, be, life, shaping, such, as, family, life, may, have, less, of, an, impact, than, non, shared, effects, which, are, harder, to, identify, one, possible, source, of, non, shared, effects, is, the, environment, of, pre, natal, development, random, variations, in, the, genetic, program, of, development, may, be, a, substantial, source, of, non, shared, environment, these, results, suggest, that, nurture, may, not, be, the, predominant, factor, in, environment, environment, and, our, situations, do, in, fact, impact, our, lives, but, not, the, way, in, which, we, would, typically, react, to, these, environmental, factors, we, are, preset, with, personality, traits, that, are, the, basis, for, how, we, would, react, to, situations, an, example, would, be, how, extraverted, prisoners, become, less, happy, than, introverted, prisoners, and, would, react, to, their, incarceration, more, negatively, due, to, their, preset, extraverted, personality, ch, 19, behavioral, genes, are, somewhat, proven, to, exist, when, we, take, a, look, at, fraternal, twins, when, fraternal, twins, are, reared, apart, they, show, the, same, similarities, in, behavior, and, response, as, if, they, have, been, reared, together, the, relationship, between, personality, and, people, s, own, well, being, is, influenced, and, mediated, by, genes, there, has, been, found, to, be, a, stable, set, point, for, happiness, that, is, characteristic, of, the, individual, largely, determined, by, the, individual, s, genes, happiness, fluctuates, around, that, setpoint, again, genetically, determined, based, on, whether, good, things, or, bad, things, are, happening, to, us, nurture, but, only, fluctuates, in, small, magnitude, in, a, normal, human, the, midpoint, of, these, fluctuations, is, determined, by, the, great, genetic, lottery, that, people, are, born, with, which, leads, them, to, conclude, that, how, happy, they, may, feel, at, the, moment, or, over, time, is, simply, due, to, the, luck, of, the, draw, or, gene, this, fluctuation, was, also, not, due, to, educational, attainment, which, only, accounted, for, less, than, 2, of, the, variance, in, well, being, for, women, and, less, than, 1, of, the, variance, for, men, they, consider, that, the, individualities, measured, together, with, personality, tests, remain, steady, throughout, an, individual, s, lifespan, they, further, believe, that, human, beings, may, refine, their, forms, or, personality, but, can, never, change, them, entirely, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, steered, naturalists, such, as, george, williams, and, william, hamilton, to, the, concept, of, personality, evolution, they, suggested, that, physical, organs, and, also, personality, is, a, product, of, natural, selection, with, the, advent, of, gene, sequencing, it, has, become, possible, to, search, for, and, identify, specific, gene, polymorphisms, that, affect, traits, such, as, iq, and, personality, these, techniques, work, by, tracking, the, association, of, differences, in, a, trait, of, interest, with, differences, in, specific, molecular, markers, or, functional, variants, an, example, of, a, visible, human, trait, for, which, the, precise, genetic, basis, of, differences, are, relatively, well, known, is, eye, color, in, contrast, to, views, developed, in, 1960s, that, gender, identity, is, primarily, learned, which, led, to, a, protocol, of, surgical, sex, changes, in, male, infants, with, injured, or, malformed, genitals, such, as, david, reimer, genomics, has, provided, solid, evidence, that, both, sex, and, gender, identities, are, primarily, influenced, by, genes, it, is, now, clear, that, genes, are, vastly, more, influential, than, virtually, any, other, force, in, shaping, sex, identity, and, gender, identity, the, growing, consensus, in, medicine, is, that, children, should, be, assigned, to, their, chromosomal, i, e, genetic, sex, regardless, of, anatomical, variations, and, differences, with, the, option, of, switching, if, desired, later, in, life
