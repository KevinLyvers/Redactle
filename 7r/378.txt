the, uralic, languages, j, r, l, k, yoor, al, ik, sometimes, called, the, uralian, languages, j, r, e, l, i, n, yoor, ay, lee, n, form, a, language, family, of, 42, languages, spoken, predominantly, in, europe, and, north, asia, the, uralic, languages, with, the, most, native, speakers, are, hungarian, which, alone, accounts, for, approximately, 60, of, speakers, finnish, and, estonian, other, languages, with, speakers, above, 100, 000, are, erzya, moksha, mari, udmurt, and, komi, spoken, in, the, european, parts, of, the, russian, federation, still, smaller, minority, languages, are, s, mi, languages, of, the, northern, fennoscandia, other, members, of, the, finnic, languages, ranging, from, livonian, in, northern, latvia, to, karelian, in, northwesternmost, russia, and, the, samoyedic, languages, mansi, and, khanty, spoken, in, western, siberia, the, name, uralic, derives, from, the, family, s, purported, original, homeland, urheimat, hypothesized, to, have, been, somewhere, in, the, vicinity, of, the, ural, mountains, and, was, first, proposed, by, julius, klaproth, in, asia, polyglotta, 1823, finno, ugric, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, uralic, though, finno, ugric, is, widely, understood, to, exclude, the, samoyedic, languages, scholars, who, do, not, accept, the, traditional, notion, that, samoyedic, split, first, from, the, rest, of, the, uralic, family, may, treat, the, terms, as, synonymous, uralic, langagues, are, known, for, their, often, complex, case, systems, and, vowel, harmony, proposed, homelands, of, the, proto, uralic, language, include, the, first, plausible, mention, of, a, people, speaking, a, uralic, language, is, in, tacitus, s, germania, c, 98, ad, mentioning, the, fenni, usually, interpreted, as, referring, to, the, s, mi, and, two, other, possibly, uralic, tribes, living, in, the, farthest, reaches, of, scandinavia, there, are, many, possible, earlier, mentions, including, the, iyrcae, perhaps, related, to, yugra, described, by, herodotus, living, in, what, is, now, european, russia, and, the, budini, described, by, herodotus, as, notably, red, haired, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, udmurts, and, living, in, northeast, ukraine, and, or, adjacent, parts, of, russia, in, the, late, 15th, century, european, scholars, noted, the, resemblance, of, the, names, hungaria, and, yugria, the, names, of, settlements, east, of, the, ural, they, assumed, a, connection, but, did, not, seek, linguistic, evidence, the, affinity, of, hungarian, and, finnish, was, first, proposed, in, the, late, 17th, century, three, candidates, can, be, credited, for, the, discovery, the, german, scholar, martin, fogel, the, swedish, scholar, georg, stiernhielm, and, the, swedish, courtier, bengt, skytte, fogel, s, unpublished, study, of, the, relationship, commissioned, by, cosimo, iii, of, tuscany, was, clearly, the, most, modern, of, these, he, established, several, grammatical, and, lexical, parallels, between, finnish, and, hungarian, as, well, as, s, mi, stiernhielm, commented, on, the, similarities, of, s, mi, estonian, and, finnish, and, also, on, a, few, similar, words, between, finnish, and, hungarian, these, authors, were, the, first, to, outline, what, was, to, become, the, classification, of, the, finno, ugric, and, later, uralic, family, this, proposal, received, some, of, its, initial, impetus, from, the, fact, that, these, languages, unlike, most, of, the, other, languages, spoken, in, europe, are, not, part, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, indo, european, family, in, 1717, the, swedish, professor, olof, rudbeck, proposed, about, 100, etymologies, connecting, finnish, and, hungarian, of, which, about, 40, are, still, considered, valid, several, early, reports, comparing, finnish, or, hungarian, with, mordvin, mari, or, khanty, were, additionally, collected, by, gottfried, leibniz, and, edited, by, his, assistant, johann, georg, von, eckhart, in, 1730, philip, johan, von, strahlenberg, published, his, book, das, nord, und, ostliche, theil, von, europa, und, asia, the, northern, and, eastern, parts, of, europe, and, asia, surveying, the, geography, peoples, and, languages, of, russia, all, the, main, groups, of, the, uralic, languages, were, already, identified, here, nonetheless, these, relationships, were, not, widely, accepted, hungarian, intellectuals, especially, were, not, interested, in, the, theory, and, preferred, to, assume, connections, with, turkic, tribes, an, attitude, characterized, by, merritt, ruhlen, as, due, to, the, wild, unfettered, romanticism, of, the, epoch, still, in, spite, of, this, hostile, climate, the, hungarian, jesuit, j, nos, sajnovics, traveled, with, maximilian, hell, to, survey, the, alleged, relationship, between, hungarian, and, s, mi, while, they, were, also, on, a, mission, to, observe, the, 1769, venus, transit, sajnovics, published, his, results, in, 1770, arguing, for, a, relationship, based, on, several, grammatical, features, in, 1799, the, hungarian, s, muel, gyarmathi, published, the, most, complete, work, on, finno, ugric, to, that, date, up, to, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, knowledge, of, the, uralic, languages, spoken, in, russia, had, remained, restricted, to, scanty, observations, by, travelers, already, the, finnish, historian, henrik, gabriel, porthan, had, stressed, that, further, progress, would, require, dedicated, field, missions, one, of, the, first, of, these, was, undertaken, by, anders, johan, sj, gren, who, brought, the, vepsians, to, general, knowledge, and, elucidated, in, detail, the, relatedness, of, finnish, and, komi, still, more, extensive, were, the, field, research, expeditions, made, in, the, 1840s, by, matthias, castr, n, 1813, 1852, and, antal, reguly, 1819, 1858, who, focused, especially, on, the, samoyedic, and, the, ob, ugric, languages, respectively, reguly, s, materials, were, worked, on, by, the, hungarian, linguist, p, l, hunfalvy, 1810, 1891, and, german, josef, budenz, 1836, 1892, who, both, supported, the, uralic, affinity, of, hungarian, budenz, was, the, first, scholar, to, bring, this, result, to, popular, consciousness, in, hungary, and, to, attempt, a, reconstruction, of, the, proto, finno, ugric, grammar, and, lexicon, another, late, 19th, century, hungarian, contribution, is, that, of, ign, cz, hal, sz, 1855, 1901, who, published, extensive, comparative, material, of, finno, ugric, and, samoyedic, in, the, 1890s, and, whose, work, is, at, the, base, of, today, s, wide, acceptance, of, the, inclusion, of, samoyedic, as, a, part, of, the, uralic, family, meanwhile, in, the, autonomous, grand, duchy, of, finland, a, chair, for, finnish, language, and, linguistics, at, the, university, of, helsinki, was, created, in, 1850, first, held, by, castr, n, in, 1883, the, finno, ugrian, society, was, founded, in, helsinki, on, the, proposal, of, otto, donner, which, would, lead, to, helsinki, overtaking, st, petersburg, as, the, chief, northern, center, of, research, of, the, uralic, languages, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, until, the, separation, of, finland, from, russia, following, the, russian, revolution, the, society, hired, many, scholars, to, survey, the, still, less, known, uralic, languages, major, researchers, of, this, period, included, heikki, paasonen, studying, especially, the, mordvinic, languages, yrj, wichmann, studying, permic, artturi, kannisto, mansi, kustaa, fredrik, karjalainen, khanty, toivo, lehtisalo, nenets, and, kai, donner, kamass, the, vast, amounts, of, data, collected, on, these, expeditions, would, provide, over, a, century, s, worth, of, editing, work, for, later, generations, of, finnish, uralicists, the, uralic, family, comprises, nine, undisputed, groups, with, no, consensus, classification, between, them, some, of, the, proposals, are, listed, in, the, next, section, an, agnostic, approach, treats, them, as, separate, branches, obsolete, or, native, names, are, displayed, in, italics, there, is, also, historical, evidence, of, a, number, of, extinct, languages, of, uncertain, affiliation, traces, of, finno, ugric, substrata, especially, in, toponymy, in, the, northern, part, of, european, russia, have, been, proposed, as, evidence, for, even, more, extinct, uralic, languages, all, uralic, languages, are, thought, to, have, descended, through, independent, processes, of, language, change, from, proto, uralic, the, internal, structure, of, the, uralic, family, has, been, debated, since, the, family, was, first, proposed, doubts, about, the, validity, of, most, or, all, of, the, proposed, higher, order, branchings, grouping, the, nine, undisputed, families, are, becoming, more, common, a, traditional, classification, of, the, uralic, languages, has, existed, since, the, late, 19th, century, it, has, enjoyed, frequent, adaptation, in, whole, or, in, part, in, encyclopedias, handbooks, and, overviews, of, the, uralic, family, otto, donner, s, model, from, 1879, is, as, follows, at, donner, s, time, the, samoyedic, languages, were, still, poorly, known, and, he, was, not, able, to, address, their, position, as, they, became, better, known, in, the, early, 20th, century, they, were, found, to, be, quite, divergent, and, they, were, assumed, to, have, separated, already, early, on, the, terminology, adopted, for, this, was, uralic, for, the, entire, family, finno, ugric, for, the, non, samoyedic, languages, though, finno, ugric, has, to, this, day, remained, in, use, also, as, a, synonym, for, the, whole, family, finno, ugric, and, samoyedic, are, listed, in, iso, 639, 5, as, primary, branches, of, uralic, the, following, table, lists, nodes, of, the, traditional, family, tree, that, are, recognized, in, some, overview, sources, little, explicit, evidence, has, however, been, presented, in, favour, of, donner, s, model, since, his, original, proposal, and, numerous, alternate, schemes, have, been, proposed, especially, in, finland, there, has, been, a, growing, tendency, to, reject, the, finno, ugric, intermediate, protolanguage, a, recent, competing, proposal, instead, unites, ugric, and, samoyedic, in, an, east, uralic, group, for, which, shared, innovations, can, be, noted, the, finno, permic, grouping, still, holds, some, support, though, the, arrangement, of, its, subgroups, is, a, matter, of, some, dispute, mordvinic, is, commonly, seen, as, particularly, closely, related, to, or, part, of, finno, samic, the, term, volgaic, or, volga, finnic, was, used, to, denote, a, branch, previously, believed, to, include, mari, mordvinic, and, a, number, of, the, extinct, languages, but, it, is, now, obsolete, and, considered, a, geographic, classification, rather, than, a, linguistic, one, within, ugric, uniting, mansi, with, hungarian, rather, than, khanty, has, been, a, competing, hypothesis, to, ob, ugric, lexicostatistics, has, been, used, in, defense, of, the, traditional, family, tree, a, recent, re, evaluation, of, the, evidence, however, fails, to, find, support, for, finno, ugric, and, ugric, suggesting, four, lexically, distinct, branches, finno, permic, hungarian, ob, ugric, and, samoyedic, one, alternative, proposal, for, a, family, tree, with, emphasis, on, the, development, of, numerals, is, as, follows, another, proposed, tree, more, divergent, from, the, standard, focusing, on, consonant, isoglosses, which, does, not, consider, the, position, of, the, samoyedic, languages, is, presented, by, viitso, 1997, and, refined, in, viitso, 2000, the, grouping, of, the, four, bottom, level, branches, remains, to, some, degree, open, to, interpretation, with, competing, models, of, finno, saamic, vs, eastern, finno, ugric, mari, mordvinic, permic, ugric, k, between, vowels, degemination, of, stops, and, finno, volgaic, finno, saamic, mari, mordvinic, between, vowels, vs, permic, ugric, viitso, finds, no, evidence, for, a, finno, permic, grouping, extending, this, approach, to, cover, the, samoyedic, languages, suggests, affinity, with, ugric, resulting, in, the, aforementioned, east, uralic, grouping, as, it, also, shares, the, same, sibilant, developments, a, further, non, trivial, ugric, samoyedic, isogloss, is, the, reduction, k, x, w, when, before, i, and, after, a, vowel, cf, k, above, or, adjacent, to, t, s, or, finno, ugric, consonant, developments, after, viitso, 2000, samoyedic, changes, after, sammallahti, 1988, the, inverse, relationship, between, consonant, gradation, and, medial, lenition, of, stops, the, pattern, also, continuing, within, the, three, families, where, gradation, is, found, is, noted, by, helimski, 1995, an, original, allophonic, gradation, system, between, voiceless, and, voiced, stops, would, have, been, easily, disrupted, by, a, spreading, of, voicing, to, previously, unvoiced, stops, as, well, a, computational, phylogenetic, study, by, honkola, et, al, 2013, classifies, the, uralic, languages, as, follows, estimated, divergence, dates, from, honkola, et, al, 2013, are, also, given, structural, characteristics, generally, said, to, be, typical, of, uralic, languages, include, basic, vocabulary, of, about, 200, words, including, body, parts, e, g, eye, heart, head, foot, mouth, family, members, e, g, father, mother, in, law, animals, e, g, viper, partridge, fish, nature, objects, e, g, tree, stone, nest, water, basic, verbs, e, g, live, fall, run, make, see, suck, go, die, swim, know, basic, pronouns, e, g, who, what, we, you, i, numerals, e, g, two, five, derivatives, increase, the, number, of, common, words, the, following, is, a, very, brief, selection, of, cognates, in, basic, vocabulary, across, the, uralic, family, which, may, serve, to, give, an, idea, of, the, sound, changes, involved, this, is, not, a, list, of, translations, cognates, have, a, common, origin, but, their, meaning, may, be, shifted, and, loanwords, may, have, replaced, them, orthographical, notes, the, hacek, denotes, postalveolar, articulation, in, northern, s, mi, while, the, acute, denotes, a, secondary, palatal, articulation, l, or, in, hungarian, vowel, length, the, finnish, letter, y, and, the, letter, in, other, languages, represent, the, high, rounded, vowel, the, letters, and, are, the, front, vowels, and, as, is, apparent, from, the, list, finnish, is, the, most, conservative, of, the, uralic, languages, presented, here, with, nearly, half, the, words, on, the, list, above, identical, to, their, proto, uralic, reconstructions, and, most, of, the, remainder, only, having, minor, changes, such, as, the, conflation, of, into, s, or, widespread, changes, such, as, the, loss, of, x, and, alteration, of, finnish, has, also, preserved, old, indo, european, borrowings, relatively, unchanged, an, example, is, porsas, pig, loaned, from, proto, indo, european, por, os, or, pre, proto, indo, iranian, por, os, unchanged, since, loaning, save, for, loss, of, palatalization, s, the, estonian, philologist, mall, hellam, proposed, cognate, sentences, that, she, asserted, to, be, mutually, intelligible, among, the, three, most, widely, spoken, uralic, languages, finnish, estonian, and, hungarian, however, linguist, geoffrey, pullum, reports, that, neither, finns, nor, hungarians, could, understand, the, other, language, s, version, of, the, sentence, no, uralic, language, has, exactly, the, idealized, typological, profile, of, the, family, typological, features, with, varying, presence, among, the, modern, uralic, language, groups, include, notes, many, relationships, between, uralic, and, other, language, families, have, been, suggested, but, none, of, these, is, generally, accepted, by, linguists, at, the, present, time, all, of, the, following, hypotheses, are, minority, views, at, the, present, time, in, uralic, studies, the, uralic, yukaghir, hypothesis, identifies, uralic, and, yukaghir, as, independent, members, of, a, single, language, family, it, is, currently, widely, accepted, that, the, similarities, between, uralic, and, yukaghir, languages, are, due, to, ancient, contacts, regardless, the, hypothesis, is, accepted, by, a, few, linguists, and, viewed, as, attractive, by, a, somewhat, larger, number, the, eskimo, uralic, hypothesis, associates, uralic, with, the, eskimo, aleut, languages, this, is, an, old, thesis, whose, antecedents, go, back, to, the, 18th, century, an, important, restatement, of, it, was, made, by, bergsland, 1959, uralo, siberian, is, an, expanded, form, of, the, eskimo, uralic, hypothesis, it, associates, uralic, with, yukaghir, chukotko, kamchatkan, and, eskimo, aleut, it, was, propounded, by, michael, fortescue, in, 1998, michael, fortescue, 2017, presented, new, evidence, in, favor, for, a, connection, between, uralic, and, other, paleo, siberian, languages, theories, proposing, a, close, relationship, with, the, altaic, languages, were, formerly, popular, based, on, similarities, in, vocabulary, as, well, as, in, grammatical, and, phonological, features, in, particular, the, similarities, in, the, uralic, and, altaic, pronouns, and, the, presence, of, agglutination, in, both, sets, of, languages, as, well, as, vowel, harmony, in, some, for, example, the, word, for, language, is, similar, in, estonian, keel, and, mongolian, hel, these, theories, are, now, generally, rejected, and, most, such, similarities, are, attributed, to, language, contact, or, coincidence, the, indo, uralic, or, indo, euralic, hypothesis, suggests, that, uralic, and, indo, european, are, related, at, a, fairly, close, level, or, in, its, stronger, form, that, they, are, more, closely, related, than, either, is, to, any, other, language, family, the, hypothesis, that, the, dravidian, languages, display, similarities, with, the, uralic, language, group, suggesting, a, prolonged, period, of, contact, in, the, past, is, popular, amongst, dravidian, linguists, and, has, been, supported, by, a, number, of, scholars, including, robert, caldwell, thomas, burrow, kamil, zvelebil, and, mikhail, andronov, this, hypothesis, has, however, been, rejected, by, some, specialists, in, uralic, languages, and, has, in, recent, times, also, been, criticised, by, other, dravidian, linguists, such, as, bhadriraju, krishnamurti, stefan, georg, describes, the, theory, as, outlandish, and, not, meriting, a, second, look, even, in, contrast, to, hypotheses, such, as, uralo, yukaghir, or, indo, uralic, nostratic, associates, uralic, indo, european, altaic, dravidian, afroasiatic, and, various, other, language, families, of, asia, the, nostratic, hypothesis, was, first, propounded, by, holger, pedersen, in, 1903, and, subsequently, revived, by, vladislav, illich, svitych, and, aharon, dolgopolsky, in, the, 1960s, eurasiatic, resembles, nostratic, in, including, uralic, indo, european, and, altaic, but, differs, from, it, in, excluding, the, south, caucasian, languages, dravidian, and, afroasiatic, and, including, chukotko, kamchatkan, nivkh, ainu, and, eskimo, aleut, it, was, propounded, by, joseph, greenberg, in, 2000, 2002, similar, ideas, had, earlier, been, expressed, by, heinrich, koppelmann, in, 1933, and, by, bj, rn, collinder, in, 1965, the, linguist, angela, marcantonio, has, argued, against, the, validity, of, several, subgroups, of, the, uralic, family, as, well, against, the, family, itself, claiming, that, many, of, the, languages, are, no, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, various, other, eurasian, languages, e, g, yukaghir, or, turkic, and, that, in, particular, hungarian, is, a, language, isolate, marcantonio, s, proposal, has, been, strongly, dismissed, by, most, reviewers, as, unfounded, and, methodologically, flawed, problems, identified, by, reviewers, include, various, unorthodox, comparisons, have, been, advanced, these, are, considered, at, best, spurious, fringe, theories, by, specialists, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in,
