the, latin, script, also, known, as, the, roman, script, is, a, writing, system, based, on, the, letters, of, the, classical, latin, alphabet, derived, from, a, form, of, the, greek, alphabet, which, was, in, use, in, the, ancient, greek, city, of, cumae, in, magna, graecia, the, greek, alphabet, was, altered, by, the, etruscans, and, subsequently, their, alphabet, was, altered, by, the, ancient, romans, several, latin, script, alphabets, exist, which, differ, in, graphemes, collation, and, phonetic, values, from, the, classical, latin, alphabet, the, latin, script, is, the, basis, of, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, and, the, 26, most, widespread, letters, are, the, letters, contained, in, the, iso, basic, latin, alphabet, which, are, the, same, letters, as, the, english, alphabet, latin, script, is, the, basis, for, the, largest, number, of, alphabets, of, any, writing, system, and, is, the, most, widely, adopted, writing, system, in, the, world, latin, script, is, used, as, the, standard, method, of, writing, the, languages, of, western, and, central, europe, most, of, sub, saharan, africa, the, americas, and, oceania, as, well, as, many, languages, in, other, parts, of, the, world, the, script, is, either, called, latin, script, or, roman, script, in, reference, to, its, origin, in, ancient, rome, though, some, of, the, capital, letters, are, greek, in, origin, in, the, context, of, transliteration, the, term, romanization, british, english, romanisation, is, often, found, unicode, uses, the, term, latin, as, does, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, the, numeral, system, is, called, the, roman, numeral, system, and, the, collection, of, the, elements, is, known, as, the, roman, numerals, the, numbers, 1, 2, 3, are, latin, roman, script, numbers, for, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, the, use, of, the, letters, i, and, v, for, both, consonants, and, vowels, proved, inconvenient, as, the, latin, alphabet, was, adapted, to, germanic, and, romance, languages, w, originated, as, a, doubled, v, vv, used, to, represent, the, voiced, labial, velar, approximant, w, found, in, old, english, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, it, came, into, common, use, in, the, later, 11th, century, replacing, the, letter, wynn, which, had, been, used, for, the, same, sound, in, the, romance, languages, the, minuscule, form, of, v, was, a, rounded, u, from, this, was, derived, a, rounded, capital, u, for, the, vowel, in, the, 16th, century, while, a, new, pointed, minuscule, v, was, derived, from, v, for, the, consonant, in, the, case, of, i, a, word, final, swash, form, j, came, to, be, used, for, the, consonant, with, the, un, swashed, form, restricted, to, vowel, use, such, conventions, were, erratic, for, centuries, j, was, introduced, into, english, for, the, consonant, in, the, 17th, century, it, had, been, rare, as, a, vowel, but, it, was, not, universally, considered, a, distinct, letter, in, the, alphabetic, order, until, the, 19th, century, by, the, 1960s, it, became, apparent, to, the, computer, and, telecommunications, industries, in, the, first, world, that, a, non, proprietary, method, of, encoding, characters, was, needed, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, encapsulated, the, latin, alphabet, in, their, iso, iec, 646, standard, to, achieve, widespread, acceptance, this, encapsulation, was, based, on, popular, usage, as, the, united, states, held, a, preeminent, position, in, both, industries, during, the, 1960s, the, standard, was, based, on, the, already, published, american, standard, code, for, information, interchange, better, known, as, ascii, which, included, in, the, character, set, the, 26, 2, uppercase, and, lowercase, letters, of, the, english, alphabet, later, standards, issued, by, the, iso, for, example, iso, iec, 10646, unicode, latin, have, continued, to, define, the, 26, 2, letters, of, the, english, alphabet, as, the, basic, latin, alphabet, with, extensions, to, handle, other, letters, in, other, languages, the, latin, alphabet, spread, along, with, latin, from, the, italian, peninsula, to, the, lands, surrounding, the, mediterranean, sea, with, the, expansion, of, the, roman, empire, the, eastern, half, of, the, empire, including, greece, turkey, the, levant, and, egypt, continued, to, use, greek, as, a, lingua, franca, but, latin, was, widely, spoken, in, the, western, half, and, as, the, western, romance, languages, evolved, out, of, latin, they, continued, to, use, and, adapt, the, latin, alphabet, with, the, spread, of, western, christianity, during, the, middle, ages, the, latin, alphabet, was, gradually, adopted, by, the, peoples, of, northern, europe, who, spoke, celtic, languages, displacing, the, ogham, alphabet, or, germanic, languages, displacing, earlier, runic, alphabets, or, baltic, languages, as, well, as, by, the, speakers, of, several, uralic, languages, most, notably, hungarian, finnish, and, estonian, the, latin, script, also, came, into, use, for, writing, the, west, slavic, languages, and, several, south, slavic, languages, as, the, people, who, spoke, them, adopted, roman, catholicism, the, speakers, of, east, slavic, languages, generally, adopted, cyrillic, along, with, orthodox, christianity, the, serbian, language, uses, both, scripts, with, cyrillic, predominating, in, official, communication, and, latin, elsewhere, as, determined, by, the, law, on, official, use, of, the, language, and, alphabet, as, late, as, 1500, the, latin, script, was, limited, primarily, to, the, languages, spoken, in, western, northern, and, central, europe, the, orthodox, christian, slavs, of, eastern, and, southeastern, europe, mostly, used, cyrillic, and, the, greek, alphabet, was, in, use, by, greek, speakers, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, arabic, script, was, widespread, within, islam, both, among, arabs, and, non, arab, nations, like, the, iranians, indonesians, malays, and, turkic, peoples, most, of, the, rest, of, asia, used, a, variety, of, brahmic, alphabets, or, the, chinese, script, through, european, colonization, the, latin, script, has, spread, to, the, americas, oceania, parts, of, asia, africa, and, the, pacific, in, forms, based, on, the, spanish, portuguese, english, french, german, and, dutch, alphabets, it, is, used, for, many, austronesian, languages, including, the, languages, of, the, philippines, and, the, malaysian, and, indonesian, languages, replacing, earlier, arabic, and, indigenous, brahmic, alphabets, latin, letters, served, as, the, basis, for, the, forms, of, the, cherokee, syllabary, developed, by, sequoyah, however, the, sound, values, are, completely, different, under, portuguese, missionary, influence, a, latin, alphabet, was, devised, for, the, vietnamese, language, which, had, previously, used, chinese, characters, the, latin, based, alphabet, replaced, the, chinese, characters, in, administration, in, the, 19th, century, with, french, rule, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, romanians, switched, to, using, the, latin, alphabet, dropping, the, romanian, cyrillic, alphabet, romanian, is, one, of, the, romance, languages, in, 1928, as, part, of, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, s, reforms, the, new, republic, of, turkey, adopted, a, latin, alphabet, for, the, turkish, language, replacing, a, modified, arabic, alphabet, most, of, the, turkic, speaking, peoples, of, the, former, ussr, including, tatars, bashkirs, azeri, kazakh, kyrgyz, and, others, had, their, writing, systems, replaced, by, the, latin, based, uniform, turkic, alphabet, in, the, 1930s, but, in, the, 1940s, all, were, replaced, by, cyrillic, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, three, of, the, newly, independent, turkic, speaking, republics, azerbaijan, uzbekistan, turkmenistan, as, well, as, romanian, speaking, moldova, officially, adopted, latin, alphabets, for, their, languages, kyrgyzstan, iranian, speaking, tajikistan, and, the, breakaway, region, of, transnistria, kept, the, cyrillic, alphabet, chiefly, due, to, their, close, ties, with, russia, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, majority, of, kurds, replaced, the, arabic, script, with, two, latin, alphabets, although, only, the, official, kurdish, government, uses, an, arabic, alphabet, for, public, documents, the, latin, kurdish, alphabet, remains, widely, used, throughout, the, region, by, the, majority, of, kurdish, speakers, in, 1957, the, people, s, republic, of, china, introduced, a, script, reform, to, the, zhuang, language, changing, its, orthography, from, sawndip, a, writing, system, based, on, chinese, to, a, latin, script, alphabet, that, used, a, mixture, of, latin, cyrillic, and, ipa, letters, to, represent, both, the, phonemes, and, tones, of, the, zhuang, language, without, the, use, of, diacritics, in, 1982, this, was, further, standardised, to, use, only, latin, script, letters, with, the, collapse, of, the, derg, and, subsequent, end, of, decades, of, amharic, assimilation, in, 1991, various, ethnic, groups, in, ethiopia, dropped, the, ge, ez, script, which, was, deemed, unsuitable, for, languages, outside, of, the, semitic, branch, in, the, following, years, the, kafa, oromo, sidama, somali, and, wolaitta, languages, switched, to, latin, while, there, is, continued, debate, on, whether, to, follow, suit, for, the, hadiyya, and, kambaata, languages, on, 15, september, 1999, the, authorities, of, tatarstan, russia, passed, a, law, to, make, the, latin, script, a, co, official, writing, system, alongside, cyrillic, for, the, tatar, language, by, 2011, a, year, later, however, the, russian, government, overruled, the, law, and, banned, latinization, on, its, territory, in, 2015, the, government, of, kazakhstan, announced, that, a, kazakh, latin, alphabet, would, replace, the, kazakh, cyrillic, alphabet, as, the, official, writing, system, for, the, kazakh, language, by, 2025, there, are, also, talks, about, switching, from, the, cyrillic, script, to, latin, in, ukraine, kyrgyzstan, and, mongolia, mongolia, however, has, since, opted, to, revive, the, mongolian, script, instead, of, switching, to, latin, in, october, 2019, the, organization, national, representational, organization, for, inuit, in, canada, itk, announced, that, they, will, introduce, a, unified, writing, system, for, the, inuit, languages, in, the, country, the, writing, system, is, based, on, the, latin, alphabet, and, is, modeled, after, the, one, used, in, the, greenlandic, language, on, 12, february, 2021, the, government, of, uzbekistan, announced, it, will, finalize, the, transition, from, cyrillic, to, latin, for, the, uzbek, language, by, 2023, plans, to, switch, to, latin, originally, began, in, 1993, but, subsequently, stalled, and, cyrillic, remained, in, widespread, use, at, present, the, crimean, tatar, language, uses, both, cyrillic, and, latin, the, use, of, latin, was, originally, approved, by, crimean, tatar, representatives, after, the, soviet, union, s, collapse, but, was, never, implemented, by, the, regional, government, after, russia, s, annexation, of, crimea, in, 2014, the, latin, script, was, dropped, entirely, nevertheless, crimean, tatars, outside, of, crimea, continue, to, use, latin, and, on, 22, october, 2021, the, government, of, ukraine, approved, a, proposal, endorsed, by, the, mejlis, of, the, crimean, tatar, people, to, switch, the, crimean, tatar, language, to, latin, by, 2025, in, july, 2020, 2, 6, billion, people, 36, of, the, world, population, use, the, latin, alphabet, by, the, 1960s, it, became, apparent, to, the, computer, and, telecommunications, industries, in, the, first, world, that, a, non, proprietary, method, of, encoding, characters, was, needed, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, encapsulated, the, latin, alphabet, in, their, iso,

uppercase, and, lowercase, letters, of, the, english, alphabet, later, standards, issued, by, the, iso, for, example, iso, iec, 10646, unicode, latin, have, continued, to, define, the, 26, 2, letters, of, the, english, alphabet, as, the, basic, latin, alphabet, with, extensions, to, handle, other, letters, in, other, languages, the, din, standard, din, 91379, specifies, a, subset, of, unicode, letters, special, characters, and, sequences, of, letters, and, diacritic, signs, to, allow, the, correct, representation, of, names, and, to, simplify, data, exchange, in, europe, this, specification, supports, all, official, languages, of, european, union, and, european, free, trade, association, countries, thus, also, the, greek, and, cyrillic, scripts, plus, the, german, minority, languages, to, allow, the, transliteration, of, names, in, other, writing, systems, to, the, latin, script, according, to, the, relevant, iso, standards, all, necessary, combinations, of, base, letters, and, diacritic, signs, are, provided, efforts, are, being, made, to, further, develop, it, into, a, european, cen, standard, in, the, course, of, its, use, the, latin, alphabet, was, adapted, for, use, in, new, languages, sometimes, representing, phonemes, not, found, in, languages, that, were, already, written, with, the, roman, characters, to, represent, these, new, sounds, extensions, were, therefore, created, be, it, by, adding, diacritics, to, existing, letters, by, joining, multiple, letters, together, to, make, ligatures, by, creating, completely, new, forms, or, by, assigning, a, special, function, to, pairs, or, triplets, of, letters, these, new, forms, are, given, a, place, in, the, alphabet, by, defining, an, alphabetical, order, or, collation, sequence, which, can, vary, with, the, particular, language, some, examples, of, new, letters, to, the, standard, latin, alphabet, are, the, runic, letters, wynn, and, thorn, and, the, letter, eth, which, were, added, to, the, alphabet, of, old, english, another, irish, letter, the, insular, g, developed, into, yogh, used, in, middle, english, wynn, was, later, replaced, with, the, new, letter, w, eth, and, thorn, with, th, and, yogh, with, gh, although, the, four, are, no, longer, part, of, the, english, or, irish, alphabets, eth, and, thorn, are, still, used, in, the, modern, icelandic, alphabet, while, eth, is, also, used, by, the, faroese, alphabet, some, west, central, and, southern, african, languages, use, a, few, additional, letters, that, have, sound, values, similar, to, those, of, their, equivalents, in, the, ipa, for, example, adangme, uses, the, letters, and, and, ga, uses, and, hausa, uses, and, for, implosives, and, for, an, ejective, africanists, have, standardized, these, into, the, african, reference, alphabet, dotted, and, dotless, i, i, and, i, are, two, forms, of, the, letter, i, used, by, the, turkish, azerbaijani, and, kazakh, alphabets, the, azerbaijani, language, also, has, which, represents, the, near, open, front, unrounded, vowel, a, digraph, is, a, pair, of, letters, used, to, write, one, sound, or, a, combination, of, sounds, that, does, not, correspond, to, the, written, letters, in, sequence, examples, are, ch, ng, rh, sh, ph, th, in, english, and, ij, ee, ch, and, ei, in, dutch, in, dutch, the, ij, is, capitalized, as, ij, or, the, ligature, but, never, as, ij, and, it, often, takes, the, appearance, of, a, ligature, very, similar, to, the, letter, in, handwriting, a, trigraph, is, made, up, of, three, letters, like, the, german, sch, the, breton, c, h, or, the, milanese, oeu, in, the, orthographies, of, some, languages, digraphs, and, trigraphs, are, regarded, as, independent, letters, of, the, alphabet, in, their, own, right, the, capitalization, of, digraphs, and, trigraphs, is, language, dependent, as, only, the, first, letter, may, be, capitalized, or, all, component, letters, simultaneously, even, for, words, written, in, title, case, where, letters, after, the, digraph, or, trigraph, are, left, in, lowercase, a, ligature, is, a, fusion, of, two, or, more, ordinary, letters, into, a, new, glyph, or, character, examples, are, from, ae, called, ash, from, oe, sometimes, called, oethel, or, e, el, the, abbreviation, from, latin, et, lit, and, called, ampersand, and, from, or, s, the, archaic, medial, form, of, s, followed, by, an, or, s, called, sharp, s, or, eszett, a, diacritic, in, some, cases, also, called, an, accent, is, a, small, symbol, that, can, appear, above, or, below, a, letter, or, in, some, other, position, such, as, the, umlaut, sign, used, in, the, german, characters, or, the, romanian, characters, its, main, function, is, to, change, the, phonetic, value, of, the, letter, to, which, it, is, added, but, it, may, also, modify, the, pronunciation, of, a, whole, syllable, or, word, indicate, the, start, of, a, new, syllable, or, distinguish, between, homographs, such, as, the, dutch, words, een, pronounced, meaning, a, or, an, and, n, pronounced, meaning, one, as, with, the, pronunciation, of, letters, the, effect, of, diacritics, is, language, dependent, english, is, the, only, major, modern, european, language, that, requires, no, diacritics, for, its, native, vocabulary, historically, in, formal, writing, a, diaeresis, was, sometimes, used, to, indicate, the, start, of, a, new, syllable, within, a, sequence, of, letters, that, could, otherwise, be, misinterpreted, as, being, a, single, vowel, e, g, co, perative, re, lect, but, modern, writing, styles, either, omit, such, marks, or, use, a, hyphen, to, indicate, a, syllable, break, e, g, co, operative, re, elect, some, modified, letters, such, as, the, symbols, and, may, be, regarded, as, new, individual, letters, in, themselves, and, assigned, a, specific, place, in, the, alphabet, for, collation, purposes, separate, from, that, of, the, letter, on, which, they, are, based, as, is, done, in, swedish, in, other, cases, such, as, with, in, german, this, is, not, done, letter, diacritic, combinations, being, identified, with, their, base, letter, the, same, applies, to, digraphs, and, trigraphs, different, diacritics, may, be, treated, differently, in, collation, within, a, single, language, for, example, in, spanish, the, character, is, considered, a, letter, and, sorted, between, n, and, o, in, dictionaries, but, the, accented, vowels, are, not, separated, from, the, unaccented, vowels, a, e, i, o, u, the, languages, that, use, the, latin, script, today, generally, use, capital, letters, to, begin, paragraphs, and, sentences, and, proper, nouns, the, rules, for, capitalization, have, changed, over, time, and, different, languages, have, varied, in, their, rules, for, capitalization, old, english, for, example, was, rarely, written, with, even, proper, nouns, capitalized, whereas, modern, english, of, the, 18th, century, had, frequently, all, nouns, capitalized, in, the, same, way, that, modern, german, is, written, today, e, g, german, alle, schwestern, der, alten, stadt, hatten, die, v, gel, gesehen, lit, all, of, the, sisters, of, the, old, city, had, seen, the, birds, words, from, languages, natively, written, with, other, scripts, such, as, arabic, or, chinese, are, usually, transliterated, or, transcribed, when, embedded, in, latin, script, text, or, in, multilingual, international, communication, a, process, termed, romanization, whilst, the, romanization, of, such, languages, is, used, mostly, at, unofficial, levels, it, has, been, especially, prominent, in, computer, messaging, where, only, the, limited, seven, bit, ascii, code, is, available, on, older, systems, however, with, the, introduction, of, unicode, romanization, is, now, becoming, less, necessary, keyboards, used, to, enter, such, text, may, still, restrict, users, to, romanized, text, as, only, ascii, or, latin, alphabet, characters, may, be, available
