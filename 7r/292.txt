in, linguistics, grammar, is, the, set, of, rules, for, how, a, natural, language, is, structured, as, demonstrated, by, its, speakers, or, writers, grammar, rules, may, concern, the, use, of, clauses, phrases, and, words, the, term, may, also, refer, to, the, study, of, such, rules, a, subject, that, includes, phonology, morphology, and, syntax, together, with, phonetics, semantics, and, pragmatics, there, are, broadly, speaking, two, different, ways, to, study, grammar, traditional, grammar, and, theoretical, grammar, fluency, in, a, particular, language, variety, involves, a, speaker, internalizing, these, rules, many, or, most, of, which, are, acquired, by, observing, other, speakers, as, opposed, to, intentional, study, or, instruction, much, of, this, internalization, occurs, during, early, childhood, learning, a, language, later, in, life, usually, involves, more, direct, instruction, the, term, grammar, can, also, describe, the, linguistic, behaviour, of, groups, of, speakers, and, writers, rather, than, individuals, differences, in, scale, are, important, to, this, meaning, for, example, english, grammar, could, describe, those, rules, followed, by, every, one, of, the, language, s, speakers, at, smaller, scales, it, may, refer, to, rules, shared, by, smaller, groups, of, speakers, a, description, study, or, analysis, of, such, rules, may, also, be, known, as, a, grammar, or, as, a, grammar, book, a, reference, work, describing, the, grammar, of, a, language, is, called, a, reference, grammar, or, simply, a, grammar, a, fully, revealed, grammar, which, describes, the, grammatical, constructions, of, a, particular, speech, type, in, great, detail, is, called, descriptive, grammar, this, kind, of, linguistic, description, contrasts, with, linguistic, prescription, a, plan, to, marginalize, some, constructions, while, codifying, others, either, absolutely, or, in, the, framework, of, a, standard, language, the, word, grammar, often, has, divergent, meanings, when, used, in, contexts, outside, linguistics, it, may, be, used, more, broadly, as, to, include, orthographic, conventions, of, written, language, such, as, spelling, and, punctuation, which, are, not, typically, considered, as, part, of, grammar, by, linguists, the, conventions, used, for, writing, a, language, it, may, also, be, used, more, narrowly, to, refer, to, a, set, of, prescriptive, norms, only, excluding, the, aspects, of, a, language, s, grammar, which, do, not, change, or, are, clearly, acceptable, or, not, without, the, need, for, discussions, the, word, grammar, is, derived, from, greek, grammatik, t, chn, which, means, art, of, letters, from, gr, mma, letter, itself, from, gr, phein, to, draw, to, write, the, same, greek, root, also, appears, in, the, words, graphics, grapheme, and, photograph, the, first, systematic, grammar, of, sanskrit, originated, in, iron, age, india, with, yaska, 6th, century, bc, p, ini, 6th, 5th, century, bc, and, his, commentators, pingala, c, 200, bc, katyayana, and, patanjali, 2nd, century, bc, tolk, ppiyam, the, earliest, tamil, grammar, is, mostly, dated, to, before, the, 5th, century, ad, the, babylonians, also, made, some, early, attempts, at, language, description, grammar, appeared, as, a, discipline, in, hellenism, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, forward, with, authors, such, as, rhyanus, and, aristarchus, of, samothrace, the, oldest, known, grammar, handbook, is, the, art, of, grammar, a, succinct, guide, to, speaking, and, writing, clearly, and, effectively, written, by, the, ancient, greek, scholar, dionysius, thrax, c, 170, c, 90, bc, a, student, of, aristarchus, of, samothrace, who, founded, a, school, on, the, greek, island, of, rhodes, dionysius, thrax, s, grammar, book, remained, the, primary, grammar, textbook, for, greek, schoolboys, until, as, late, as, the, twelfth, century, ad, the, romans, based, their, grammatical, writings, on, it, and, its, basic, format, remains, the, basis, for, grammar, guides, in, many, languages, even, today, latin, grammar, developed, by, following, greek, models, from, the, 1st, century, bc, due, to, the, work, of, authors, such, as, orbilius, pupillus, remmius, palaemon, marcus, valerius, probus, verrius, flaccus, and, aemilius, asper, the, grammar, of, irish, originated, in, the, 7th, century, with, auraicept, na, n, ces, arabic, grammar, emerged, with, abu, al, aswad, al, du, ali, in, the, 7th, century, the, first, treatises, on, hebrew, grammar, appeared, in, the, high, middle, ages, in, the, context, of, midrash, exegesis, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, karaite, tradition, originated, in, abbasid, baghdad, the, diqduq, 10th, century, is, one, of, the, earliest, grammatical, commentaries, on, the, hebrew, bible, ibn, barun, in, the, 12th, century, compares, the, hebrew, language, with, arabic, in, the, islamic, grammatical, tradition, belonging, to, the, trivium, of, the, seven, liberal, arts, grammar, was, taught, as, a, core, discipline, throughout, the, middle, ages, following, the, influence, of, authors, from, late, antiquity, such, as, priscian, treatment, of, vernaculars, began, gradually, during, the, high, middle, ages, with, isolated, works, such, as, the, first, grammatical, treatise, but, became, influential, only, in, the, renaissance, and, baroque, periods, in, 1486, antonio, de, nebrija, published, las, introduciones, latinas, contrapuesto, el, romance, al, latin, and, the, first, spanish, grammar, gram, tica, de, la, lengua, castellana, in, 1492, during, the, 16th, century, italian, renaissance, the, questione, della, lingua, was, the, discussion, on, the, status, and, ideal, form, of, the, italian, language, initiated, by, dante, s, de, vulgari, eloquentia, pietro, bembo, prose, della, volgar, lingua, venice, 1525, the, first, grammar, of, slovene, was, written, in, 1583, by, adam, bohori, and, grammatica, germanicae, linguae, the, first, grammar, of, german, was, published, in, 1578, grammars, of, some, languages, began, to, be, compiled, for, the, purposes, of, evangelism, and, bible, translation, from, the, 16th, century, onward, such, as, grammatica, o, arte, de, la, lengua, general, de, los, indios, de, los, reynos, del, per, 1560, a, quechua, grammar, by, fray, domingo, de, santo, tom, s, from, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, grammar, came, to, be, understood, as, a, subfield, of, the, emerging, discipline, of, modern, linguistics, the, deutsche, grammatik, of, jacob, grimm, was, first, published, in, the, 1810s, the, comparative, grammar, of, franz, bopp, the, starting, point, of, modern, comparative, linguistics, came, out, in, 1833, frameworks, of, grammar, which, seek, to, give, a, precise, scientific, theory, of, the, syntactic, rules, of, grammar, and, their, function, have, been, developed, in, theoretical, linguistics, other, frameworks, are, based, on, an, innate, universal, grammar, an, idea, developed, by, noam, chomsky, in, such, models, the, object, is, placed, into, the, verb, phrase, the, most, prominent, biologically, oriented, theories, are, parse, trees, are, commonly, used, by, such, frameworks, to, depict, their, rules, there, are, various, alternative, schemes, for, some, grammar, grammars, evolve, through, usage, historically, with, the, advent, of, written, representations, formal, rules, about, language, usage, tend, to, appear, also, although, such, rules, tend, to, describe, writing, conventions, more, accurately, than, conventions, of, speech, formal, grammars, are, codifications, of, usage, which, are, developed, by, repeated, documentation, and, observation, over, time, as, rules, are, established, and, developed, the, prescriptive, concept, of, grammatical, correctness, can, arise, this, often, produces, a, discrepancy, between, contemporary, usage, and, that, which, has, been, accepted, over, time, as, being, standard, or, correct, linguists, tend, to, view, prescriptive, grammar, as, having, little, justification, beyond, their, authors, aesthetic, tastes, although, style, guides, may, give, useful, advice, about, standard, language, employment, based, on, descriptions, of, usage, in, contemporary, writings, of, the, same, language, linguistic, prescriptions, also, form, part, of, the, explanation, for, variation, in, speech, particularly, variation, in, the, speech, of, an, individual, speaker, for, example, why, some, speakers, say, i, didn, t, do, nothing, some, say, i, didn, t, do, anything, and, some, say, one, or, the, other, depending, on, social, context, the, formal, study, of, grammar, is, an, important, part, of, children, s, schooling, from, a, young, age, through, advanced, learning, though, the, rules, taught, in, schools, are, not, a, grammar, in, the, sense, that, most, linguists, use, particularly, as, they, are, prescriptive, in, intent, rather, than, descriptive, constructed, languages, also, called, planned, languages, or, conlangs, are, more, common, in, the, modern, day, although, still, extremely, uncommon, compared, to, natural, languages, many, have, been, designed, to, aid, human, communication, for, example, naturalistic, interlingua, schematic, esperanto, and, the, highly, logical, lojban, each, of, these, languages, has, its, own, grammar, syntax, refers, to, the, linguistic, structure, above, the, word, level, for, example, how, sentences, are, formed, though, without, taking, into, account, intonation, which, is, the, domain, of, phonology, morphology, by, contrast, refers, to, the, structure, at, and, below, the, word, level, for, example, how, compound, words, are, formed, but, above, the, level, of, individual, sounds, which, like, intonation, are, in, the, domain, of, phonology, however, no, clear, line, can, be, drawn, between, syntax, and, morphology, analytic, languages, use, syntax, to, convey, information, that, is, encoded, by, inflection, in, synthetic, languages, in, other, words, word, order, is, not, significant, and, morphology, is, highly, significant, in, a, purely, synthetic, language, whereas, morphology, is, not, significant, and, syntax, is, highly, significant, in, an, analytic, language, for, example, chinese, and, afrikaans, are, highly, analytic, thus, meaning, is, very, context, dependent, both, have, some, inflections, and, both, have, had, more, in, the, past, thus, they, are, becoming, even, less, synthetic, and, more, purely, analytic, over, time, latin, which, is, highly, synthetic, uses, affixes, and, inflections, to, convey, the, same, information, that, chinese, does, with, syntax, because, latin, words, are, quite, though, not, totally, self, contained, an, intelligible, latin, sentence, can, be, made, from, elements, that, are, arranged, almost, arbitrarily, latin, has, a, complex, affixation, and, simple, syntax, whereas, chinese, has, the, opposite, prescriptive, grammar, is, taught, in, primary, and, secondary, school, the, term, grammar, school, historically, referred, to, a, school, attached, to, a, cathedral, or, monastery, that, teaches, latin, grammar, to, future, priests, and, monks, it, originally, referred, to, a, school, that, taught, students, how, to, read, scan, interpret, and, declaim, greek, and, latin, poets, including, homer, virgil, euripides, and, others, these, should, not, be, mistaken, for, the, related, albeit, distinct, modern, british, grammar, schools, a, standard, language, is, a, dialect, that, is, promoted, above, other, dialects, in, writing, education, and, broadly, speaking, in, the, public, sphere, it, contrasts, with, vernacular, dialects, which, may, be, the, objects, of, study, in, academic, descriptive, linguistics, but, which, are, rarely, taught, prescriptively, the, standardized, first, language, taught, in, primary, education, may, be, subject, to, political, controversy, because, it, may, sometimes, establish, a, standard, defining, nationality, or, ethnicity, recently, efforts, have, begun, to, update, grammar, instruction, in, primary, and, secondary, education, the, main, focus, has, been, to, prevent, the, use, of, outdated, prescriptive, rules, in, favor, of, setting, norms, based, on, earlier, descriptive, research, and, to, change, perceptions, about, the, relative, correctness, of, prescribed, standard, forms, in, comparison, to, non, standard, dialects, a, series, of, metastudies, have, found, that, the, explicit, teaching, of, grammatical, parts, of, speech, and, syntax, has, little, or, no, effect, on, the, improvement, of, student, writing, quality, in, elementary, school, middle, school, of, high, school, other, methods, of, writing, instruction, had, far, greater, positive, effect, including, strategy, instruction, collaborative, writing, summary, writing, process, instruction, sentence, combining, and, inquiry, projects, the, preeminence, of, parisian, french, has, reigned, largely, unchallenged, throughout, the, history, of, modern, french, literature, standard, italian, is, based, on, the, speech, of, florence, rather, than, the, capital, because, of, its, influence, on, early, literature, likewise, standard, spanish, is, not, based, on, the, speech, of, madrid, but, on, that, of, educated, speakers, from, more, northern, areas, such, as, castile, and, le, n, see, gram, tica, de, la, lengua, castellana, in, argentina, and, uruguay, the, spanish, standard, is, based, on, the, local, dialects, of, buenos, aires, and, montevideo, rioplatense, spanish, portuguese, has, for, now, two, official, standards, brazilian, portuguese, and, european, portuguese, the, serbian, variant, of, serbo, croatian, is, likewise, divided, serbia, and, the, republika, srpska, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, use, their, own, distinct, normative, subvarieties, with, differences, in, yat, reflexes, the, existence, and, codification, of, a, distinct, montenegrin, standard, is, a, matter, of, controversy, some, treat, montenegrin, as, a, separate, standard, lect, and, some, think, that, it, should, be, considered, another, form, of, serbian, norwegian, has, two, standards, bokm, l, and, nynorsk, the, choice, between, which, is, subject, to, controversy, each, norwegian, municipality, can, either, declare, one,

the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, until, about, 1800, it, was, almost, exclusively, a, written, language, but, now, it, is, so, widely, spoken, that, most, of, the, former, german, dialects, are,
