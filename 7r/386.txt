of, india, and, nepal, it, was, developed, and, in, regular, use, by, the, 8th, century, ce, and, achieved, its, modern, form, by, 1200, ce, the, devan, gari, script, composed, of, 48, primary, characters, including, 14, vowels, and, 34, consonants, is, the, fourth, most, widely, adopted, writing, system, in, the, world, being, used, for, over, 120, languages, the, orthography, of, this, script, reflects, the, pronunciation, of, the, language, unlike, the, latin, alphabet, the, script, has, no, concept, of, letter, case, it, is, written, from, left, to, right, has, a, strong, preference, for, symmetrical, rounded, shapes, within, squared, outlines, and, is, recognisable, by, a, horizontal, line, known, as, a, irorekh, that, runs, along, the, top, of, full, letters, in, a, cursory, look, the, devan, gar, script, appears, different, from, other, indic, scripts, such, as, bengali, assamese, or, gurmukhi, but, a, closer, examination, reveals, they, are, very, similar, except, for, angles, and, structural, emphasis, among, the, languages, using, it, as, a, primary, or, secondary, script, are, marathi, p, i, sanskrit, hindi, boro, nepali, sherpa, prakrit,

and, santali, the, devan, gar, script, is, closely, related, to, the, nandin, gar, script, commonly, found, in, numerous, ancient, manuscripts, of, south, india, and, it, is, distantly, related, to, a, number, of, southeast, asian, scripts, devan, gar, is, formed, by, the, addition, of, the, word, deva, to, the, word, n, gar, n, gar, is, an, adjective, derived, from, nagara, a, sanskrit, word, meaning, town, or, city, and, literally, means, urban, or, urbane, the, word, n, gar, implicitly, modifying, lipi, script, was, used, on, its, own, to, refer, to, a, north, indian, script, or, perhaps, a, number, of, such, scripts, as, al, biruni, attests, in, the, 11th, century, the, form, devan, gar, is, attested, later, at, least, by, the, 18th, century, the, name, of, the, nandin, gar, script, is, also, formed, by, adding, a, prefix, to, the, generic, script, name, n, gar, the, precise, origin, and, significance, of, the, prefix, deva, remains, unclear, devan, gar, is, part, of, the, brahmic, family, of, scripts, of, india, nepal, tibet, and, southeast, asia, it, is, a, descendant, of, the, 3rd, century, bce, br, hm, script, which, evolved, into, the, nagari, script, which, in, turn, gave, birth, to, devan, gar, and, nandin, gar, devan, gar, has, been, widely, adopted, across, india, and, nepal, to, write, sanskrit, marathi, hindi, central, indo, aryan, languages, konkani, boro, and, various, nepalese, languages, some, of, the, earliest, epigraphic, evidence, attesting, to, the, developing, sanskrit, n, gar, script, in, ancient, india, is, from, the, 1st, to, 4th, century, ce, inscriptions, discovered, in, gujarat, variants, of, script, called, n, gar, recognisably, close, to, devan, gar, are, first, attested, from, the, 1st, century, ce, rudradaman, inscriptions, in, sanskrit, while, the, modern, standardised, form, of, devan, gar, was, in, use, by, about, 1000, ce, medieval, inscriptions, suggest, widespread, diffusion, of, n, gar, related, scripts, with, biscripts, presenting, local, script, along, with, the, adoption, of, n, gar, scripts, for, example, the, mid, 8th, century, pattadakal, pillar, in, karnataka, has, text, in, both, siddha, matrika, script, and, an, early, telugu, kannada, script, while, the, kangra, jawalamukhi, inscription, in, himachal, pradesh, is, written, in, both, sharada, and, devan, gar, scripts, the, n, gar, script, was, in, regular, use, by, the, 7th, century, ce, and, it, was, fully, developed, by, about, the, end, of, first, millennium, the, use, of, sanskrit, in, n, gar, script, in, medieval, india, is, attested, by, numerous, pillar, and, cave, temple, inscriptions, including, the, 11th, century, udayagiri, inscriptions, in, madhya, pradesh, and, an, inscribed, brick, found, in, uttar, pradesh, dated, to, be, from, 1217, ce, which, is, now, held, at, the, british, museum, the, script, s, prototypes, and, related, versions, have, been, discovered, with, ancient, relics, outside, india, in, places, such, as, sri, lanka, myanmar, and, indonesia, in, east, asia, the, siddha, matrika, script, considered, as, the, closest, precursor, to, n, gar, was, in, use, by, buddhists, n, gar, has, been, the, primus, inter, pares, of, the, indic, scripts, it, has, long, been, used, traditionally, by, religiously, educated, people, in, south, asia, to, record, and, transmit, information, existing, throughout, the, land, in, parallel, with, a, wide, variety, of, local, scripts, such, as, mo, kaithi, and, mahajani, used, for, administration, commerce, and, other, daily, uses, sharada, remained, in, parallel, use, in, kashmir, an, early, version, of, devan, gar, is, visible, in, the, kutila, inscription, of, bareilly, dated, to, vs, 1049, 992, ce, which, demonstrates, the, emergence, of, the, horizontal, bar, to, group, letters, belonging, to, a, word, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, sanskrit, texts, from, the, early, post, maurya, period, consists, of, 1, 413, n, gar, pages, of, a, commentary, by, patanjali, with, a, composition, date, of, about, 150, bce, the, surviving, copy, transcribed, about, 14th, century, ce, in, the, 7th, century, under, the, rule, of, songtsen, gampo, of, the, tibetan, empire, thonmi, sambhota, was, sent, to, nepal, to, open, marriage, negotiations, with, a, nepali, princess, and, to, find, a, writing, system, suitable, for, the, tibetan, language, he, then, invented, the, tibetan, script, based, on, the, n, gar, used, in, kashmir, he, added, 6, new, characters, for, sounds, that, did, not, exist, in, sanskrit, other, scripts, closely, related, to, n, gar, such, as, siddha, were, introduced, throughout, east, and, southeast, asia, from, the, 7th, to, the, 10th, centuries, ce, notably, in, indonesia, vietnam, and, japan, most, of, the, southeast, asian, scripts, have, roots, in, dravidian, scripts, but, a, few, found, in, south, central, regions, of, java, and, isolated, parts, of, southeast, asia, resemble, devan, gar, or, its, prototypes, the, kawi, script, in, particular, is, similar, to, the, devan, gar, in, many, respects, though, the, morphology, of, the, script, has, local, changes, the, earliest, inscriptions, in, the, devan, gar, like, scripts, are, from, around, the, 10th, century, ce, with, many, more, between, the, 11th, and, 14th, centuries, some, of, the, old, devan, gar, inscriptions, are, found, in, hindu, temples, of, java, such, as, the, prambanan, temple, the, ligor, and, the, kalasan, inscriptions, of, central, java, dated, to, the, 8th, century, are, also, in, the, n, gar, script, of, north, india, according, to, the, epigraphist, and, asian, studies, scholar, lawrence, briggs, these, may, be, related, to, the, 9th, century, copper, plate, inscription, of, devapaladeva, bengal, which, is, also, in, early, devan, gar, script, the, term, kawi, in, kawi, script, is, a, loan, word, from, k, vya, poetry, according, to, anthropologists, and, asian, studies, scholars, john, norman, miksic, and, goh, geok, yian, the, 8th, century, version, of, early, n, gar, or, devan, gar, script, was, adopted, in, java, bali, and, khmer, around, the, 8th, 9th, centuries, as, evidenced, by, the, many, contemporaneous, inscriptions, of, this, period, the, letter, order, of, devan, gar, like, nearly, all, br, hmic, scripts, is, based, on, phonetic, principles, that, consider, both, the, manner, and, place, of, articulation, of, the, consonants, and, vowels, they, represent, this, arrangement, is, usually, referred, to, as, the, var, am, l, garland, of, letters, the, format, of, devan, gar, for, sanskrit, serves, as, the, prototype, for, its, application, with, minor, variations, or, additions, to, other, languages, the, vowels, and, their, arrangement, are, the, table, below, shows, the, consonant, letters, in, combination, with, inherent, vowel, a, and, their, arrangement, to, the, right, of, the, devan, gar, letter, it, shows, the, latin, script, transliteration, using, international, alphabet, of, sanskrit, transliteration, and, the, phonetic, value, ipa, in, hindi, table, consonants, with, vowel, diacritics, vowels, in, their, independent, form, on, the, top, and, in, their, corresponding, dependent, form, vowel, sign, combined, with, the, consonant, k, on, the, bottom, ka, is, without, any, added, vowel, sign, where, the, vowel, a, is, inherent, a, vowel, combines, with, a, consonant, in, their, diacritic, form, for, example, the, vowel, combines, with, the, consonant, k, to, form, the, syllabic, letter, k, with, halant, cancel, sign, removed, and, added, vowel, sign, which, is, indicated, by, diacritics, the, vowel, a, combines, with, the, consonant, k, to, form, ka, with, halant, removed, but, the, diacritic, series, of, ka, kha, ga, gha, respectively, is, without, any, added, vowel, sign, as, the, vowel, a, is, inherent, the, combinations, of, all, consonants, and, vowels, each, in, alphabetical, order, are, laid, out, in, the, b, r, kha, or, b, rahkha, table, in, the, following, barakhadi, table, the, transliteration, of, each, combination, will, appear, on, mouseover, the, following, letter, variants, are, also, in, use, particularly, in, older, texts, and, in, specific, regions, as, mentioned, successive, consonants, lacking, a, vowel, in, between, them, may, physically, join, as, a, conjunct, consonant, or, ligature, when, devan, gar, is, used, for, writing, languages, other, than, sanskrit, conjuncts, are, used, mostly, with, sanskrit, words, and, loan, words, native, words, typically, use, the, basic, consonant, and, native, speakers, know, to, suppress, the, vowel, when, it, is, conventional, to, do, so, for, example, the, native, hindi, word, karn, is, written, ka, ra, n, the, government, of, these, clusters, ranges, from, widely, to, narrowly, applicable, rules, with, special, exceptions, within, while, standardised, for, the, most, part, there, are, certain, variations, in, clustering, of, which, the, unicode, used, on, this, page, is, just, one, scheme, the, following, are, a, number, of, rules, the, pitch, accent, of, vedic, sanskrit, is, written, with, various, symbols, depending, on, shakha, in, the, rigveda, anud, tta, is, written, with, a, bar, below, the, line, svarita, with, a, stroke, above, the, line, while, ud, tta, is, unmarked, the, end, of, a, sentence, or, half, verse, may, be, marked, with, the, symbol, called, a, da, a, meaning, bar, or, called, a, p, r, a, vir, m, meaning, full, stop, pause, the, end, of, a, full, verse, may, be, marked, with, a, double, da, a, a, symbol, a, comma, called, an, alpa, vir, m, meaning, short, stop, pause, is, used, to, denote, a, natural, pause, in, speech, punctuation, marks, of, western, origin, such, as, the, colon, semicolon, exclamation, mark, dash, and, question, mark, have, been, in, use, in, devan, gar, script, since, at, least, the, 1900s, matching, their, use, in, european, languages, a, variety, of, unicode, fonts, are, in, use, for, devan, gar, these, include, akshar, annapurna, arial, cdac, gist, surekh, cdac, gist, yogesh, chandas, gargi, gurumaa, jaipur, jana, kalimati, kanjirowa, lohit, devanagari, mangal, kokila, preeti, raghu, sanskrit2003, santipur, ot, siddhanta, and, thyaka, the, form, of, devan, gar, fonts, vary, with, function, according, to, harvard, college, for, sanskrit, studies, uttara, is, the, best, in, terms, of, ligatures, but, because, it, is, designed, for, vedic, as, well, requires, so, much, vertical, space, that, it, is, not, well, suited, for, the, user, interface, font, though, an, excellent, choice, for, the, original, field, font, santipur, ot, is, a, beautiful, font, reflecting, a, very, early, typesetting, style, for, devanagari, sanskrit, 2003, is, a, good, all, around, font, and, has, more, ligatures, than, most, fonts, though, students, will, probably, find, the, spacing, of, the, cdac, gist, surekh, font, makes, for, quicker, comprehension, and, reading, the, google, fonts, project, has, a, number, of, unicode, fonts, for, devan, gar, in, a, variety, of, typefaces, in, serif, sans, serif, display, and, handwriting, categories, there, are, several, methods, of, romanisation, or, transliteration, from, devan, gar, to, the, roman, script, the, hunterian, system, is, the, national, system, of, romanisation, in, india, officially, adopted, by, the, government, of, india, a, standard, transliteration, convention, was, codified, in, the, iso, 15919, standard, of, 2001, it, uses, diacritics, to, map, the, much, larger, set, of, br, hmic, graphemes, to, the, latin, script, the, devan, gar, specific, portion, is, nearly, identical, to, the, academic, standard, for, sanskrit, iast, the, international, alphabet, of, sanskrit, transliteration, iast, is, the, academic, standard, for, the, romanisation, of, sanskrit, iast, is, the, de, facto, standard, used, in, printed, publications, like, books, magazines, and, electronic, texts, with, unicode, fonts, it, is, based, on, a, standard, established, by, the, congress, of, orientalists, at, athens, in, 1912, the, iso, 15919, standard, of, 2001, codified, the, transliteration, convention, to, include, an, expanded, standard, for, sister, scripts, of, devan, gar, the, national, library, at, kolkata, romanisation, intended, for, the, romanisation, of, all, indic, scripts, is, an, extension, of, iast, compared, to, iast, harvard, kyoto, looks, much, simpler, it, does, not, contain, all, the, diacritic, marks, that, iast, contains, it, was, designed, to, simplify, the, task, of, putting, large, amount, of, sanskrit, textual, material, into, machine, readable, form, and, the, inventors, stated, that, it, reduces, the, effort, needed, in, transliteration, of, sanskrit, texts, on, the, keyboard, this, makes, typing, in, harvard, kyoto, much, easier, than, iast, harvard, kyoto, uses, capital, letters, that, can, be, difficult, to, read, in, the, middle, of, words, itrans, is, a, lossless, transliteration, scheme, of, devan, gar, into, ascii, that, is, widely, used, on, usenet, it, is, an, extension, of, the, harvard, kyoto, scheme, in, itrans, the, word, devan, gar, is, written, devanaagarii, or, devanagari, itrans, is, associated, with, an, application, of, the, same, name, that, enables, typesetting, in, indic, scripts, the, user, inputs, in, roman, letters, and, the, itrans, pre, processor, translates, the, roman, letters, into, devan, gar, or, other, indic, languages, the, latest, version, of, itrans, is, version, 5, 30, released, in, july, 2001, it, is, similar, to, velthuis, system, and, was, created, by, avinash, chopde, to, help, print, various, indic, scripts, with, personal, computers, the, disadvantage, of, the, above, ascii, schemes, is, case, sensitivity, implying, that, transliterated, names, may, not, be, capitalised, this, difficulty, is, avoided, with, the, system, developed, in, 1996, by, frans, velthuis, for, tex, loosely, based, on, iast, in, which, case, is, irrelevant, ala, lc, romanisation, is, a, transliteration, scheme, approved, by, the, library, of, congress, and, the, american, library, association, and, widely, used, in, north, american, libraries, transliteration, tables, are, based, on, languages, so, there, is, a, table, for, hindi, one, for, sanskrit, and, prakrit, etc, wx, is, a, roman, transliteration, scheme, for, indian, languages, widely, used, among, the, natural, language, processing, community, in, india, it, originated, at, iit, kanpur, for, computational, processing, of, indian, languages, the, salient, features, of, this, transliteration, scheme, are, as, follows, iscii, is, an, 8, bit, encoding, the, lower, 128, codepoints, are, plain, ascii, the, upper, 128, codepoints, are, iscii, specific, it, has, been, designed, for, representing, not, only, devan, gar, but, also, various, other, indic, scripts, as, well, as, a, latin, based, script, with, diacritic, marks, used, for, transliteration, of, the, indic, scripts, iscii, has, largely, been, superseded, by, unicode, which, has, however, attempted, to, preserve, the, iscii, layout, for, its, indic, language, blocks, the, unicode, standard, defines, four, blocks, for, devan, gar, devanagari, u, 0900, u, 097f, devanagari, extended, u, a8e0, u, a8ff, devanagari, extended, a, u, 11b00, 11b5f, and, vedic, extensions, u, 1cd0, u, 1cff, inscript, is, the, standard, keyboard, layout, for, devan, gar, as, standardized, by, the, government, of, india, it, is, inbuilt, in, all, modern, major, operating, systems, microsoft, windows, supports, the, inscript, layout, which, can, be, used, to, input, unicode, devan, gar, characters, inscript, is, also, available, in, some, touchscreen, mobile, phones, this, layout, was, used, on, manual, typewriters, when, computers, were, not, available, or, were, uncommon, for, backward, compatibility, some, typing, tools, like, indic, ime, still, provide, this, layout, such, tools, work, on, phonetic, transliteration, the, user, writes, in, the, latin, alphabet, and, the, ime, automatically, converts, it, into, devan, gar, some, popular, phonetic, typing, tools, are, akruti, baraha, ime, and, google, ime, the, mac, os, x, operating, system, includes, two, different, keyboard, layouts, for, devan, gar, one, resembles, the, inscript, kde, linux, while, the, other, is, a, phonetic, layout, called, devan, gar, qwerty, any, one, of, the, unicode, fonts, input, systems, is, fine, for, the, indic, language, wikipedia, and, other, wikiprojects, including, hindi, bhojpuri, marathi, and, nepali, wikipedia, while, some, people, use, inscript, the, majority, uses, either, google, phonetic, transliteration, or, the, input, facility, universal, language, selector, provided, on, wikipedia, on, indic, language, wikiprojects, the, phonetic, facility, provided, initially, was, java, based, and, was, later, supported, by, narayam, extension, for, phonetic, input, facility, currently, indic, language, wiki, projects, are, supported, by, universal, language, selector, uls, that, offers, both, phonetic, keyboard, aksharantaran, marathi, hindi, and, inscript, keyboard, marathi, the, ubuntu, linux, operating, system, supports, several, keyboard, layouts, for, devan, gar, including, harvard, kyoto, wx, notation, bolanagari, and, phonetic, the, remington, typing, method, in, ubuntu, ibus, is, similar, to, the, krutidev, typing, method, popular, in, rajasthan, the, itrans, method, is, useful, for, those, who, know, english, and, the, english, keyboard, well, but, are, not, familiar, with, typing, in, devan, gar, thousands, of, manuscripts, of, ancient, and, medieval, era, sanskrit, texts, in, devan, gar, have, been, discovered, since, the, 19th, century, major, catalogues, and, census, include
