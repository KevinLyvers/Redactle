https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion
extraversion, and, introversion, are, a, central, trait, dimension, in, human, personality, theory, the, terms, were, introduced, into, psychology, by, carl, jung, though, both, the, popular, understanding, and, current, psychological, usage, are, not, the, same, as, jung, s, original, concept, extraversion, also, spelled, extroversion, tends, to, be, manifested, in, outgoing, talkative, energetic, behavior, whereas, introversion, is, manifested, in, more, reflective, and, reserved, behavior, jung, defined, introversion, as, an, attitude, type, characterised, by, orientation, in, life, through, subjective, psychic, contents, and, extraversion, as, an, attitude, type, characterised, by, concentration, of, interest, on, the, external, object, extraversion, and, introversion, are, typically, viewed, as, a, single, continuum, so, to, be, higher, in, one, necessitates, being, lower, in, the, other, jung, provides, a, different, perspective, and, suggests, that, everyone, has, both, an, extraverted, side, and, an, introverted, side, with, one, being, more, dominant, than, the, other, virtually, all, comprehensive, models, of, personality, include, these, concepts, in, various, forms, examples, include, the, big, five, model, jung, s, analytical, psychology, hans, eysenck, s, three, factor, model, raymond, cattell, s, 16, personality, factors, the, minnesota, multiphasic, personality, inventory, and, the, myers, briggs, type, indicator, in, september, 1909, swiss, psychiatrist, carl, jung, used, the, term, introverted, in, a, lecture, at, clark, university, a, transcript, of, this, lecture, was, then, published, with, two, others, in, a, journal, in, 1910, the, first, time, the, term, appeared, in, print, in, the, lecture, he, mentions, that, love, that, is, introverted, is, turned, inward, into, the, subject, and, there, produces, increased, imaginative, activity, his, 1921, book, psychologische, typen, was, published, as, personality, types, in, english, in, 1923, it, described, the, introverted, in, detail, for, the, first, time, in, his, later, paper, psychologische, typologie, he, gives, a, more, concise, definition, of, the, introverted, type, writing, he, holds, aloof, from, external, happenings, does, not, join, in, has, a, distinct, dislike, of, society, as, soon, as, he, finds, himself, among, too, many, people, in, a, large, gathering, he, feels, lonely, and, lost, the, more, crowded, it, is, the, greater, becomes, his, resistance, he, is, not, in, the, least, with, it, and, has, no, love, of, enthusiastic, get, togethers, he, is, not, a, good, mixer, what, he, does, he, does, in, his, own, way, barricading, himself, against, influences, from, outside, he, is, apt, to, appear, awkward, often, seeming, inhibited, and, it, frequently, happens, that, by, a, certain, brusqueness, of, manner, or, by, his, glum, unapproachability, or, some, kind, of, malapropism, he, causes, unwitting, offence, to, people, for, him, self, communings, are, a, pleasure, his, own, world, is, a, safe, harbor, a, carefully, tended, and, walled, in, garden, closed, to, the, public, and, hidden, from, prying, eyes, his, own, company, is, the, best, he, feels, at, home, in, his, world, where, the, only, changes, are, made, by, himself, his, best, work, is, done, with, his, own, resources, on, his, own, initiative, and, in, his, own, way, crowds, majority, views, public, opinion, popular, enthusiasm, never, convince, him, of, anything, but, mere, make, him, creep, still, deeper, into, his, shell, his, relations, with, other, people, become, warm, only, when, safety, is, guaranteed, and, when, he, can, lay, aside, his, defensive, distrust, all, too, often, he, cannot, and, consequently, the, number, of, friends, and, acquaintances, is, very, restricted, in, the, 1950s, british, psychologist, hans, eysenck, theorized, that, the, trait, of, introversion, extraversion, could, be, explained, in, terms, of, clark, hull, s, drive, theory, of, motivation, he, later, developed, his, own, arousal, theory, to, explain, individual, differences, in, the, trait, suggesting, that, the, brains, of, extraverts, were, chronically, under, aroused, leading, them, to, seek, out, stimulation, from, the, environment, the, trait, of, introversion, extraversion, would, become, one, of, three, central, traits, in, eysenck, s, pen, theory, of, personality, william, mcdougall, discussed, jung, s, conception, and, reached, this, conclusion, the, introverts, are, those, in, whom, reflective, thought, inhibits, and, postpones, action, and, expression, the, extroverts, are, those, in, whom, the, energies, liberated, upon, the, stirring, of, any, propensity, flow, out, freely, in, outward, action, and, expression, extraversion, is, the, state, of, primarily, obtaining, gratification, from, outside, oneself, extraverts, tend, to, enjoy, human, interactions, and, to, be, enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and, gregarious, extraverts, are, energized, and, thrive, off, being, around, other, people, they, take, pleasure, in, activities, that, involve, large, social, gatherings, such, as, parties, community, activities, public, demonstrations, and, business, or, political, groups, they, also, tend, to, work, well, in, groups, an, extraverted, person, is, likely, to, enjoy, time, spent, with, people, and, find, less, reward, in, time, spent, alone, they, tend, to, be, energized, when, around, other, people, and, they, are, more, prone, to, boredom, when, they, are, by, themselves, introversion, is, the, state, of, primarily, obtaining, gratification, from, one, s, own, mental, life, introverts, are, typically, perceived, as, more, reserved, or, reflective, some, popular, psychologists, have, characterized, introverts, as, people, whose, energy, tends, to, expand, through, reflection, and, dwindle, during, interaction, this, is, similar, to, jung, s, view, although, he, focused, on, mental, energy, rather, than, physical, energy, few, modern, conceptions, make, this, distinction, introverts, often, take, pleasure, in, solitary, activities, such, as, reading, writing, or, meditating, an, introvert, is, likely, to, enjoy, time, spent, alone, and, find, less, reward, in, time, spent, with, large, groups, of, people, introverts, are, easily, overwhelmed, by, too, much, stimulation, from, social, gatherings, and, engagement, introversion, having, even, been, defined, by, some, in, terms, of, a, preference, for, a, quiet, more, minimally, stimulating, external, environment, they, prefer, to, concentrate, on, a, single, activity, at, a, time, and, like, to, observe, situations, before, they, participate, especially, observed, in, developing, children, and, adolescents, they, are, more, analytical, before, speaking, a, study, published, in, the, journal, of, social, psychology, found, that, introverts, tend, to, have, higher, levels, of, self, awareness, and, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, deep, thought, and, reflection, mistaking, introversion, for, shyness, is, a, common, error, introversion, is, a, preference, while, shyness, stems, from, distress, introverts, prefer, solitary, to, social, activities, but, do, not, necessarily, fear, social, encounters, like, shy, people, do, susan, cain, author, of, the, book, quiet, the, power, of, introverts, in, a, world, that, can, t, stop, talking, argues, that, modern, western, culture, misjudges, the, capabilities, of, introverted, people, leading, to, a, waste, of, talent, energy, and, happiness, cain, describes, how, society, is, biased, against, introverts, and, that, with, people, being, taught, from, childhood, that, to, be, sociable, is, to, be, happy, introversion, is, now, considered, somewhere, between, a, disappointment, and, pathology, in, contrast, cain, says, that, introversion, is, not, a, second, class, trait, but, that, both, introverts, and, extraverts, enrich, society, with, examples, including, the, introverts, isaac, newton, albert, einstein, mahatma, gandhi, dr, seuss, w, b, yeats, steven, spielberg, and, larry, page, most, contemporary, trait, theories, measure, levels, of, extraversion, introversion, as, part, of, a, single, continuous, dimension, of, personality, with, some, scores, near, one, end, and, others, near, the, halfway, mark, ambiversion, is, falling, more, or, less, in, the, middle, quiet, author, susan, cain, reported, studies, indicating, that, 33, to, 50, of, the, american, population, are, introverts, particular, demographics, have, higher, prevalence, with, a, 6, 000, subject, mbti, based, survey, indicating, that, 60, of, attorneys, and, 90, of, intellectual, property, attorneys, are, introverts, the, extent, of, extraversion, and, introversion, is, most, commonly, assessed, through, self, report, measures, although, peer, reports, and, third, party, observation, can, also, be, used, self, report, measures, are, either, lexical, or, based, on, statements, the, type, of, measure, is, determined, by, an, assessment, of, psychometric, properties, and, the, time, and, space, constraints, of, the, research, being, undertaken, lexical, measures, use, individual, adjectives, that, reflect, extravert, and, introvert, traits, such, as, outgoing, talkative, reserved, and, quiet, words, representing, introversion, are, reverse, coded, to, create, composite, measures, of, extraversion, introversion, running, on, a, continuum, goldberg, 1992, developed, a, 20, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 100, word, big, five, markers, saucier, 1994, developed, a, briefer, 8, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 40, word, mini, markers, however, the, psychometric, properties, of, saucier, s, original, mini, markers, have, been, found, to, be, suboptimal, with, samples, outside, of, north, america, as, a, result, a, systematically, revised, measure, was, developed, to, have, better, psychometric, properties, the, international, english, mini, markers, the, international, english, mini, markers, has, good, internal, consistency, reliabilities, and, other, validity, for, assessing, extraversion, introversion, and, other, five, factor, personality, dimensions, both, within, and, especially, without, american, populations, internal, consistency, reliability, of, the, extraversion, measure, for, native, english, speakers, is, reported, as, a, cronbach, s, alpha, of, 0, 92, that, for, non, native, english, speakers, is, of, 0, 85, statement, measures, tend, to, contain, more, words, and, hence, consume, more, research, instrument, space, than, lexical, measures, respondents, are, asked, the, extent, to, which, they, for, example, talk, to, a, lot, of, different, people, at, parties, or, often, feel, uncomfortable, around, others, while, some, statement, based, measures, of, extraversion, introversion, have, similarly, acceptable, psychometric, properties, in, north, american, populations, to, lexical, measures, their, generally, emic, development, makes, them, less, suited, to, use, in, other, populations, for, example, statements, asking, about, talkativeness, in, parties, are, hard, to, answer, meaningfully, by, those, who, do, not, attend, parties, as, americans, are, assumed, to, do, moreover, the, sometimes, colloquial, north, american, language, of, statements, makes, them, less, suited, for, use, outside, america, for, instance, statements, like, keep, in, the, background, and, know, how, to, captivate, people, are, sometimes, hard, for, non, native, english, speakers, to, understand, except, in, a, literal, sense, hans, eysenck, described, extraversion, introversion, as, the, degree, to, which, a, person, is, outgoing, and, interactive, with, other, people, these, behavioral, differences, are, presumed, to, be, the, result, of, underlying, differences, in, brain, physiology, eysenck, associated, cortical, inhibition, and, excitation, with, the, ascending, reticular, activation, system, aras, a, pathway, located, in, the, brainstem, extraverts, seek, excitement, and, social, activity, in, an, effort, to, raise, their, naturally, low, arousal, level, whereas, introverts, tend, to, avoid, social, situations, in, an, effort, to, avoid, raising, their, naturally, high, arousal, level, too, far, eysenck, designated, extraversion, as, one, of, three, major, traits, in, his, p, e, n, model, of, personality, which, also, includes, psychoticism, and, neuroticism, eysenck, originally, suggested, that, extraversion, was, a, combination, of, two, major, tendencies, impulsiveness, and, sociability, he, later, added, several, other, more, specific, traits, namely, liveliness, activity, level, and, excitability, these, traits, are, further, linked, in, his, personality, hierarchy, to, even, more, specific, habitual, responses, such, as, partying, on, the, weekend, eysenck, compared, this, trait, to, the, four, temperaments, of, ancient, medicine, with, choleric, and, sanguine, temperaments, equating, to, extraversion, and, melancholic, and, phlegmatic, temperaments, equating, to, introversion, the, relative, importance, of, nature, versus, environment, in, determining, the, level, of, extraversion, is, controversial, and, the, focus, of, many, studies, twin, studies, have, found, a, genetic, component, of, 39, to, 58, in, terms, of, the, environmental, component, the, shared, family, environment, appears, to, be, far, less, important, than, individual, environmental, factors, that, are, not, shared, between, siblings, eysenck, proposed, that, extraversion, was, caused, by, variability, in, cortical, arousal, he, hypothesized, that, introverts, are, characterized, by, higher, levels, of, activity, than, extraverts, and, so, are, chronically, more, cortically, aroused, than, extraverts, that, extraverts, require, more, external, stimulation, than, introverts, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, other, evidence, of, the, stimulation, hypothesis, is, that, introverts, salivate, more, than, extraverts, in, response, to, a, drop, of, lemon, juice, this, is, due, to, increased, activity, in, their, aras, which, responds, to, stimuli, like, food, or, social, contact, extraversion, has, been, linked, to, higher, sensitivity, of, the, mesolimbic, dopamine, system, to, potentially, rewarding, stimuli, this, in, part, explains, the, high, levels, of, positive, affect, found, in, extraverts, since, they, will, more, intensely, feel, the, excitement, of, a, potential, reward, one, consequence, of, this, is, that, extraverts, can, more, easily, learn, the, contingencies, for, positive, reinforcement, since, the, reward, itself, is, experienced, as, greater, one, study, found, that, introverts, have, more, blood, flow, in, the, frontal, lobes, of, their, brain, and, the, anterior, or, frontal, thalamus, which, are, areas, dealing, with, internal, processing, such, as, planning, and, problem, solving, extraverts, have, more, blood, flow, in, the, anterior, cingulate, gyrus, temporal, lobes, and, posterior, thalamus, which, are, involved, in, sensory, and, emotional, experience, this, study, and, other, research, indicate, that, introversion, extraversion, is, related, to, individual, differences, in, brain, function, a, study, on, regional, brain, volume, found, a, positive, correlation, between, introversion, and, grey, matter, volume, in, the, right, prefrontal, cortex, and, right, temporoparietal, junction, as, well, as, a, positive, correlation, between, introversion, and, total, white, matter, volume, task, related, functional, neuroimaging, has, shown, that, extraversion, is, associated, with, increased, activity, in, the, anterior, cingulate, gyrus, prefrontal, cortex, middle, temporal, gyrus, and, the, amygdala, extraversion, has, also, been, linked, to, physiological, factors, such, as, respiration, through, its, association, with, surgency, various, differences, in, behavioral, characteristics, are, attributed, to, extraverts, and, introverts, according, to, one, study, extraverts, tend, to, wear, more, decorative, clothing, whereas, introverts, prefer, practical, comfortable, clothes, extraverts, are, more, likely, to, prefer, more, upbeat, conventional, and, energetic, music, than, introverts, personality, also, influences, how, people, arrange, their, work, areas, in, general, extraverts, decorate, their, offices, more, keep, their, doors, open, keep, extra, chairs, nearby, and, are, more, likely, to, put, dishes, of, candy, on, their, desks, these, are, attempts, to, invite, co, workers, and, encourage, interaction, introverts, in, contrast, decorate, less, and, tend, to, arrange, their, workspace, to, discourage, social, interaction, extraverts, and, introverts, often, use, social, media, differently, extraverts, may, be, more, active, on, platforms, like, instagram, and, facebook, posting, frequently, and, engaging, with, others, introverts, might, prefer, smaller, more, intimate, online, communities, or, use, platforms, like, reddit, for, anonymous, discussions, despite, these, differences, a, meta, analysis, of, 15, experience, sampling, studies, has, suggested, that, there, is, a, great, deal, of, overlap, in, the, way, that, extraverts, and, introverts, behave, in, these, studies, participants, used, mobile, devices, to, report, how, extraverted, e, g, bold, talkative, assertive, outgoing, they, were, acting, at, multiple, times, during, their, daily, lives, fleeson, and, gallagher, 2009, found, that, extraverts, regularly, behave, in, an, introverted, way, and, introverts, regularly, behave, in, an, extraverted, way, indeed, there, was, more, within, person, variability, than, between, person, variability, in, extraverted, behaviors, the, key, feature, that, distinguishes, extraverts, and, introverts, was, that, extraverts, tend, to, act, moderately, extraverted, about, 5, 10, more, often, than, introverts, from, this, perspective, extraverts, and, introverts, are, not, fundamentally, different, rather, an, extravert, is, just, someone, who, acts, more, extraverted, more, often, suggesting, that, extraversion, is, more, about, what, one, does, than, what, one, has, additionally, a, study, by, lippa, 1978, found, evidence, for, the, extent, to, which, individuals, present, themselves, in, a, different, way, this, is, called, expressive, behavior, and, it, is, dependent, upon, the, individuals, motivation, and, ability, to, control, that, behavior, lippa, 1978, examined, 68, students, who, were, asked, to, role, play, by, pretending, to, teach, a, math, class, the, students, level, of, extraversion, and, introversion, were, rated, based, on, their, external, expressive, behaviors, such, as, stride, length, graphic, expansiveness, the, percentage, of, time, they, spent, talking, the, amount, of, time, they, spent, making, eye, contact, and, the, total, time, of, each, teaching, session, this, study, found, that, actual, introverts, were, perceived, and, judged, as, having, more, extraverted, looking, expressive, behaviors, because, they, were, higher, in, terms, of, their, self, monitoring, this, means, that, the, introverts, consciously, put, more, effort, into, presenting, a, more, extraverted, and, rather, socially, desirable, version, of, themselves, thus, individuals, are, able, to, regulate, and, modify, behavior, based, on, their, environmental, situations, humans, are, complex, and, unique, and, because, introversion, extraversion, varies, along, a, continuum, individuals, may, have, a, mixture, of, both, orientations, a, person, who, acts, introverted, in, one, situation, may, act, extraverted, in, another, and, people, can, learn, to, act, in, counter, dispositional, ways, in, certain, situations, for, example, brian, little, s, free, trait, theory, suggests, that, people, can, take, on, free, traits, behaving, in, ways, that, may, not, be, their, first, nature, but, can, strategically, advance, projects, that, are, important, to, them, together, this, presents, an, optimistic, view, of, what, extraversion, is, rather, than, being, fixed, and, stable, individuals, vary, in, their, extraverted, behaviors, across, different, moments, and, can, choose, to, act, extraverted, to, advance, important, personal, projects, or, even, increase, their, happiness, as, mentioned, above, researchers, have, found, a, correlation, between, extraversion, and, self, reported, happiness, that, is, more, extraverted, people, tend, to, report, higher, levels, of, happiness, than, introverts, other, research, has, shown, that, being, instructed, to, act, in, an, extraverted, manner, leads, to, increases, in, positive, affect, even, for, people, who, are, trait, level, introverts, extraverts, report, experiencing, more, positive, emotions, whereas, introverts, tend, to, be, closer, to, neutral, this, may, be, because, extraversion, is, socially, preferable, in, contemporary, western, culture, and, thus, introversion, feels, less, desirable, in, addition, to, the, research, on, happiness, other, studies, have, found, that, extraverts, tend, to, report, higher, levels, of, self, esteem, than, introverts, others, suggest, that, such, results, reflect, socio, cultural, bias, in, the, survey, itself, dr, david, meyers, has, claimed, that, happiness, is, a, matter, of, possessing, three, traits, self, esteem, optimism, and, extraversion, meyers, bases, his, conclusions, on, studies, that, report, extraverts, to, be, happier, these, findings, have, been, questioned, in, light, of, the, fact, that, the, happiness, prompts, given, to, the, studies, subjects, such, as, i, like, to, be, with, others, and, i, m, fun, to, be, with, only, measure, happiness, among, extraverts, also, according, to, carl, jung, introverts, acknowledge, more, readily, their, psychological, needs, and, problems, whereas, extraverts, tend, to, be, oblivious, to, them, because, they, focus, more, on, the, outer, world, although, extraversion, is, perceived, as, socially, desirable, in, western, culture, it, is, not, always, an, advantage, for, example, extraverted, youths, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, antisocial, or, delinquent, behavior, in, line, with, this, certain, evidence, suggest, that, the, trait, of, extraversion, may, also, be, related, to, that, of, psychopathy, conversely, while, introversion, is, perceived, as, less, socially, desirable, it, is, strongly, associated, with, positive, traits, such, as, intelligence, and, giftedness, though, more, recent, large, scale, meta, analyses, have, found, that, the, activity, facet, of, extraversion, has, the, most, sizable, positive, relations, with, cognitive, abilities, for, many, years, researchers, have, found, that, introverts, tend, to, be, more, successful, in, academic, environments, which, extraverts, may, find, boring, research, shows, that, behavioral, immune, system, the, psychological, processes, that, infer, infection, risk, from, perceptual, cues, and, respond, to, these, perceptual, cues, through, the, activation, of, aversive, emotions, may, influence, gregariousness, although, extraversion, is, associated, with, many, positive, outcomes, like, higher, levels, of, happiness, those, extraverted, people, are, also, more, likely, to, be, exposed, to, communicable, diseases, such, as, airborne, infections, as, they, tend, to, have, more, contact, with, people, when, individuals, are, more, vulnerable, to, infection, the, cost, of, being, social, will, be, relatively, greater, therefore, people, tend, to, be, less, extraversive, when, they, feel, vulnerable, and, vice, versa, some, claim, that, americans, live, in, an, extraverted, society, that, rewards, extravert, behavior, and, rejects, introversion, this, is, because, the, u, s, is, a, culture, of, external, personality, whereas, in, some, other, cultures, people, are, valued, for, their, inner, selves, and, their, moral, rectitude, other, cultures, such, as, those, in, china, india, japan, and, regions, where, eastern, orthodox, christianity, buddhism, hinduism, sufism, etc, prevail, prize, introversion, these, cultural, differences, predict, individuals, happiness, in, that, people, who, score, higher, in, extraversion, are, happier, on, average, in, particularly, extraverted, cultures, and, vice, versa, despite, this, extraverts, are, still, seen, as, prototypical, leaders, in, traditionally, introverted, cultures, researchers, have, found, that, people, who, live, on, islands, tend, to, be, less, extraverted, more, introverted, than, those, living, on, the, mainland, and, that, people, whose, ancestors, had, inhabited, the, island, for, twenty, generations, tend, to, be, less, extraverted, than, more, recent, arrivals, furthermore, people, who, emigrate, from, islands, to, the, mainland, tend, to, be, more, extraverted, than, people, that, stay, on, islands, and, those, that, immigrate, to, islands, in, the, united, states, researchers, have, found, that, people, living, in, the, midwestern, states, of, north, dakota, south, dakota, nebraska, minnesota, wisconsin, and, illinois, score, higher, than, the, u, s, average, on, extraversion, utah, and, the, southeastern, states, of, florida, and, georgia, also, score, high, on, this, personality, trait, the, most, introverted, states, in, the, u, s, are, maryland, new, hampshire, alaska, washington, oregon, and, vermont, people, who, live, in, the, northwestern, states, of, idaho, montana, and, wyoming, are, also, relatively, introverted, as, earlier, stated, extraverts, are, often, found, to, have, higher, levels, of, positive, affect, than, introverts, however, this, relationship, has, only, been, found, between, extraversion, and, activated, forms, of, positive, affect, there, is, no, relationship, between, extraversion, and, deactivated, calm, forms, of, positive, affect, such, as, contentment, or, serenity, although, one, study, found, a, negative, relationship, between, extraversion, and, deactivated, positive, affect, i, e, a, positive, relationship, between, introversion, and, calm, positive, affect, moreover, the, relationship, between, extraversion, and, activated, positive, affect, is, only, significant, for, agentic, extraversion, i, e, there, is, no, significant, relationship, between, affiliative, extraversion, and, activated, positive, affect, especially, when, controlling, for, neuroticism, an, influential, review, article, concluded, that, personality, specifically, extraversion, and, emotional, stability, was, the, best, predictor, of, subjective, well, being, as, examples, argyle, and, lu, 1990, found, that, the, trait, of, extraversion, as, measured, by, extraversion, scale, of, the, eysenck, personality, questionnaire, epq, was, positively, and, significantly, correlated, with, positive, affect, as, measured, by, the, oxford, happiness, inventory, using, the, same, positive, affect, and, extraversion, scales, hills, and, argyle, 2001, found, that, positive, affect, was, again, significantly, correlated, with, extraversion, also, the, study, by, emmons, and, diener, 1986, showed, that, extraversion, correlates, positively, and, significantly, with, positive, affect, but, not, with, negative, affect, similar, results, were, found, in, a, large, longitudinal, study, by, diener, sandvik, pavot, and, fujita, 1992, which, assessed, 14, 407, participants, from, 100, areas, of, continental, united, states, using, the, abbreviated, general, well, being, schedule, which, tapped, positive, and, negative, affects, and, costa, and, mccrae, s, 1986, short, version, of, the, neo, s, extraversion, scale, the, authors, reported, that, extraverts, experienced, greater, well, being, at, two, points, in, time, during, which, data, were, collected, first, between, 1971, and, 1975, and, later, between, 1981, and, 1984, however, the, latter, study, did, not, control, for, neuroticism, an, important, covariate, when, investigating, relationships, between, extraversion, and, positive, affect, or, wellbeing, studies, that, controlled, for, neuroticism, have, found, no, significant, relationship, between, extraversion, and, subjective, well, being, larsen, and, ketelaar, 1991, showed, that, extraverts, respond, more, to, positive, affect, than, to, negative, affect, since, they, exhibit, more, positive, affect, reactivity, to, the, positive, affect, induction, yet, they, do, not, react, more, negatively, to, the, negative, affect, induction, the, instrumental, view, proposes, that, personality, traits, give, rise, to, conditions, and, actions, which, have, affective, consequences, and, thus, generate, individual, differences, in, emotionality, according, to, the, instrumental, view, one, explanation, for, greater, subjective, well, being, among, extraverts, could, be, that, extraversion, helps, in, the, creation, of, life, circumstances, which, promote, high, levels, of, positive, affect, specifically, the, personality, trait, of, extraversion, is, seen, as, a, facilitator, of, more, social, interactions, since, the, low, cortical, arousal, among, extraverts, results, in, them, seeking, more, social, situations, in, order, to, increase, their, arousal, according, to, the, social, activity, hypothesis, more, frequent, participation, in, social, situations, creates, more, frequent, and, higher, levels, of, positive, affect, therefore, it, is, believed, that, since, extraverts, are, characterized, as, more, sociable, than, introverts, they, also, possess, higher, levels, of, positive, affect, brought, on, by, social, interactions, specifically, the, results, of, furnham, and, brewin, s, study, 1990, suggest, that, extraverts, enjoy, and, participate, more, in, social, activities, than, introverts, and, as, a, result, extraverts, report, a, higher, level, of, happiness, also, in, the, study, of, argyle, and, lu, 1990, extraverts, were, found, to, be, less, likely, to, avoid, participation, in, noisy, social, activities, and, to, be, more, likely, to, participate, in, social, activities, such, as, party, games, jokes, or, going, to, the, cinema, similar, results, were, reported, by, diener, larsen, and, emmons, 1984, who, found, that, extraverts, seek, social, situations, more, often, than, introverts, especially, when, engaging, in, recreational, activities, however, a, variety, of, findings, contradict, the, claims, of, the, social, activity, hypothesis, firstly, it, was, found, that, extraverts, were, happier, than, introverts, even, when, alone, specifically, extraverts, tend, to, be, happier, regardless, of, whether, they, live, alone, or, with, others, or, whether, they, live, in, a, vibrant, city, or, quiet, rural, environment, similarly, a, study, by, diener, sandvik, pavot, and, fujita, 1992, showed, that, although, extraverts, chose, social, jobs, relatively, more, frequently, 51, than, nonsocial, jobs, compared, to, introverts, 38, they, were, happier, than, introverts, regardless, of, whether, their, occupations, had, social, or, nonsocial, character, secondly, it, was, found, that, extraverts, only, sometimes, reported, greater, amounts, of, social, activity, than, introverts, but, in, general, extraverts, and, introverts, do, not, differ, in, the, quantity, of, their, socialization, similar, finding, was, reported, by, srivastava, angelo, and, vallereux, 2008, who, found, that, extraverts, and, introverts, both, enjoy, participating, in, social, interactions, but, extraverts, participate, socially, more, thirdly, studies, have, shown, that, both, extraverts, and, introverts, participate, in, social, relations, but, that, the, quality, of, this, participation, differs, the, more, frequent, social, participation, among, extraverts, could, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, extraverts, know, more, people, but, those, people, are, not, necessarily, their, close, friends, whereas, introverts, when, participating, in, social, interactions, are, more, selective, and, have, only, few, close, friends, with, whom, they, have, special, relationships, yet, another, explanation, of, the, high, correlation, between, extraversion, and, happiness, comes, from, the, study, by, ashton, lee, and, paunonen, 2002, they, suggested, that, the, core, element, of, extraversion, is, a, tendency, to, behave, in, ways, that, attract, hold, and, enjoy, social, attention, and, not, reward, sensitivity, they, claimed, that, one, of, the, fundamental, qualities, of, social, attention, is, its, potential, of, being, rewarding, therefore, if, a, person, shows, positive, emotions, of, enthusiasm, energy, and, excitement, that, person, is, seen, favorably, by, others, and, he, or, she, gains, others, attention, this, favorable, reaction, from, others, likely, encourages, extraverts, to, engage, in, further, extraverted, behavior, ashton, lee, and, paunonen, s, 2002, study, showed, that, their, measure, of, social, attention, the, social, attention, scale, was, much, more, highly, correlated, with, extraversion, than, were, measures, of, reward, sensitivity, temperamental, view, is, based, on, the, notion, that, there, is, a, direct, link, between, people, s, personality, traits, and, their, sensitivity, to, positive, and, negative, affects, the, affective, reactivity, model, states, that, the, strength, of, a, person, s, reactions, to, affect, relevant, events, are, caused, by, people, s, differences, in, affect, this, model, is, based, on, the, reinforcement, sensitivity, theory, by, jeffrey, alan, gray, which, states, that, people, with, stronger, behavioral, activation, system, bas, are, high, in, reward, responsiveness, and, are, predisposed, to, the, personality, trait, of, extraversion, while, people, with, a, stronger, behavioral, inhibition, system, bis, are, lower, in, reward, responsiveness, and, are, more, predisposed, to, personality, trait, of, neuroticism, and, introversion, therefore, extraverts, are, seen, as, having, a, temperamental, predisposition, to, positive, affect, since, positive, mood, induction, has, a, greater, effect, on, them, than, on, introverts, thus, extraverts, are, more, prone, to, react, to, pleasant, effects, for, example, gable, reis, and, elliot, 2000, found, in, two, consecutive, studies, that, people, with, more, sensitive, bis, reported, higher, levels, of, average, negative, affect, while, people, with, more, sensitive, bas, reported, higher, levels, of, positive, affect, also, zelenski, and, larsen, 1999, found, that, people, with, more, sensitive, bas, reported, more, positive, emotions, during, the, positive, mood, induction, while, people, with, more, sensitive, bis, reported, more, negative, emotions, during, the, negative, mood, induction, the, social, reactivity, theory, alleges, that, all, humans, whether, they, like, it, or, not, are, required, to, participate, in, social, situations, since, extraverts, prefer, engaging, in, social, interactions, more, than, introverts, they, also, derive, more, positive, affect, from, such, situations, than, introverts, do, the, support, for, this, theory, comes, from, work, of, brian, r, little, who, popularized, concept, of, restorative, niches, little, claimed, that, life, often, requires, people, to, participate, in, social, situations, and, since, acting, social, is, out, of, character, for, introverts, it, was, shown, to, harm, their, well, being, therefore, one, way, to, preserve, introverts, well, being, is, for, them, to, recharge, as, often, as, possible, in, places, where, they, can, return, to, their, true, selves, places, little, calls, restorative, niches, however, it, was, also, found, that, extraverts, did, not, respond, stronger, to, social, situations, than, introverts, nor, did, they, report, bigger, boosts, of, positive, affect, during, such, interactions, another, possible, explanation, for, more, happiness, among, extraverts, comes, from, the, fact, that, extraverts, are, able, to, better, regulate, their, affective, states, this, means, that, in, ambiguous, situations, situations, where, positive, and, negative, moods, are, introduced, and, mixed, in, similar, proportions, extraverts, show, a, slower, decrease, of, positive, affect, and, as, a, result, they, maintained, a, more, positive, affect, balance, than, introverts, extraverts, may, also, choose, activities, that, facilitate, happiness, e, g, recalling, pleasant, vs, unpleasant, memories, more, than, introverts, when, anticipating, difficult, tasks, according, to, the, set, point, model, levels, of, positive, and, negative, affects, are, more, or, less, fixed, within, each, individual, hence, after, a, positive, or, negative, event, people, s, moods, tend, to, go, back, to, the, pre, set, level, according, to, the, set, point, model, extraverts, experience, more, happiness, because, their, pre, set, level, of, positive, affect, is, set, higher, than, the, pre, set, point, of, positive, affect, in, introverts, therefore, extraverts, require, less, positive, reinforcement, in, order, to, feel, happy, a, study, by, peter, kuppens, 2008, showed, that, extraverts, and, introverts, engage, in, different, behaviors, when, feeling, pleasant, which, may, explain, underestimation, of, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, happiness, exhibited, by, introverts, specifically, kuppens, 2008, found, that, arousal, and, pleasantness, are, positively, correlated, for, extraverts, which, means, that, pleasant, feelings, are, more, likely, to, be, accompanied, by, high, arousal, for, extraverts, on, the, other, hand, arousal, and, pleasantness, are, negatively, correlated, for, introverts, resulting, in, introverts, exhibiting, low, arousal, when, feeling, pleasant, in, other, words, if, everything, is, going, well, in, an, extravert, s, life, which, is, a, source, of, pleasant, feelings, extraverts, see, such, a, situation, as, an, opportunity, to, engage, in, active, behavior, and, goal, pursuit, which, brings, about, an, active, aroused, pleasant, state, when, everything, is, going, well, for, introverts, they, see, it, as, an, opportunity, to, let, down, their, guard, resulting, in, them, feeling, relaxed, and, content, though, extraversion, has, consistently, been, shown, to, have, a, strong, correlation, with, happiness, and, well, being, these, findings, are, complicated, by, the, presence, of, other, personality, traits, that, act, as, strong, indicators, of, happiness, in, multiple, studies, neuroticism, has, been, shown, to, have, an, equal, if, not, larger, impact, on, happiness, and, subjective, well, being, than, extraversion, one, study, classified, school, children, into, four, categories, based, on, their, scores, in, assessments, of, extraversion, and, emotional, stability, neuroticism, the, results, showed, no, significant, difference, between, the, happiness, levels, of, stable, introverts, and, stable, extraverts, while, unstable, extraverts, and, introverts, both, demonstrated, significantly, less, happiness, than, their, counterparts, in, this, study, neuroticism, appeared, to, be, the, more, salient, factor, for, overall, well, being, likewise, in, later, studies, researchers, used, assessment, scales, to, test, for, categories, such, as, self, esteem, and, life, goal, orientation, which, they, had, positively, correlated, with, happiness, participants, responses, to, these, scales, suggested, that, neuroticism, actually, had, a, larger, impact, than, extraversion, in, measures, of, well, being, though, extraversion, and, neuroticism, seem, to, have, the, largest, effect, on, personal, happiness, other, big, 5, personality, factors, have, also, been, shown, to, correlate, with, happiness, and, subjective, well, being, for, example, one, study, showed, that, conscientiousness, and, agreeableness, correlated, about, 0, 20, with, subjective, well, being, while, the, effect, of, these, traits, was, not, as, strong, as, extraversion, or, neuroticism, it, is, clear, that, they, still, have, some, impact, on, happiness, outcomes, similarly, interactions, between, extraversion, neuroticism, and, conscientiousness, have, demonstrated, significant, impacts, on, subjective, well, being, in, one, study, researchers, used, three, scales, to, assess, subjective, well, being, they, found, that, extraversion, only, served, as, a, predictor, for, one, assessment, in, conjunction, with, neuroticism, while, the, other, two, assessment, outcomes, were, better, predicted, by, conscientiousness, and, neuroticism, in, addition, to, the, importance, of, including, other, factors, in, happiness, assessments, this, study, also, demonstrates, the, manner, in, which, an, operational, definition, of, well, being, changes, whether, extraversion, emerges, as, a, salient, predictive, factor, there, is, also, evidence, that, other, non, trait, elements, of, personality, may, correlate, with, happiness, for, instance, one, study, demonstrated, that, various, features, of, one, s, goals, such, as, progress, towards, important, goals, or, conflicts, between, them, can, affect, both, emotional, and, cognitive, well, being, several, other, researchers, have, also, suggested, that, at, least, in, more, individualistic, cultures, having, a, coherent, sense, of, one, s, personality, and, acting, in, a, way, that, conforms, to, that, self, concept, is, positively, related, to, well, being, thus, focusing, solely, on, extraversion, or, even, extraversion, and, neuroticism, is, likely, to, provide, an, incomplete, picture, of, the, relationship, between, happiness, and, personality, in, addition, one, s, culture, may, also, influence, happiness, and, overall, subjective, well, being, the, overall, level, of, happiness, fluctuates, from, culture, to, culture, as, does, preferred, expression, of, happiness, comparing, various, international, surveys, across, countries, reveals, that, different, nations, and, different, ethnic, groups, within, nations, exhibit, differences, in, average, life, satisfaction, for, example, one, researcher, found, that, between, 1958, and, 1987, japanese, life, satisfaction, fluctuated, around, 6, on, a, 10, point, scale, while, denmark, s, fluctuated, around, 8, comparing, ethnic, groups, within, the, united, states, another, study, found, that, european, americans, reported, being, significantly, happier, with, their, lives, than, asian, americans, researchers, have, hypothesized, a, number, of, factors, that, could, be, responsible, for, these, differences, between, countries, including, national, differences, in, overall, income, levels, self, serving, biases, and, self, enhancement, and, approach, and, avoidance, orientations, taken, together, these, findings, suggest, that, while, extraversion, introversion, does, have, a, strong, correlation, with, happiness, it, does, not, stand, alone, as, a, sole, predictor, of, subjective, well, being, and, that, other, factors, must, be, accounted, for, when, trying, to, determine, the, correlates, of, happiness
