judiciary, and, for, regional, and, local, government, this, process, is, also, used, in, many, other, private, and, business, organisations, from, clubs, to, voluntary, associations, and, corporations, the, global, use, of, elections, as, a, tool, for, selecting, representatives, in, modern, representative, democracies, is, in, contrast, with, the, practice, in, the, democratic, archetype, ancient, athens, where, the, elections, were, considered, an, oligarchic, institution, and, most, political, offices, were, filled, using, sortition, also, known, as, allotment, by, which, officeholders, were, chosen, by, lot, electoral, reform, describes, the, process, of, introducing, fair, electoral, systems, where, they, are, not, in, place, or, improving, the, fairness, or, effectiveness, of, existing, systems, psephology, is, the, study, of, results, and, other, statistics, relating, to, elections, especially, with, a, view, to, predicting, future, results, election, is, the, fact, of, electing, or, being, elected, to, elect, means, to, select, or, make, a, decision, and, so, sometimes, other, forms, of, ballot, such, as, referendums, are, referred, to, as, elections, especially, in, the, united, states, elections, were, used, as, early, in, history, as, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, and, throughout, the, medieval, period, to, select, rulers, such, as, the, holy, roman, emperor, see, imperial, election, and, the, pope, see, papal, election, the, pala, king, gopala, ruled, c, 750s, 770s, ce, in, early, medieval, bengal, was, elected, by, a, group, of, feudal, chieftains, such, elections, were, quite, common, in, contemporary, societies, of, the, region, in, the, chola, empire, around, 920, ce, in, uthiramerur, in, present, day, tamil, nadu, palm, leaves, were, used, for, selecting, the, village, committee, members, the, leaves, with, candidate, names, written, on, them, were, put, inside, a, mud, pot, to, select, the, committee, members, a, young, boy, was, asked, to, take, out, as, many, leaves, as, the, number, of, positions, available, this, was, known, as, the, kudavolai, system, the, first, recorded, popular, elections, of, officials, to, public, office, by, majority, vote, where, all, citizens, were, eligible, both, to, vote, and, to, hold, public, office, date, back, to, the, ephors, of, sparta, in, 754, bc, under, the, mixed, government, of, the, spartan, constitution, athenian, democratic, elections, where, all, citizens, could, hold, public, office, were, not, introduced, for, another, 247, years, until, the, reforms, of, cleisthenes, under, the, earlier, solonian, constitution, c, 574, bc, all, athenian, citizens, were, eligible, to, vote, in, the, popular, assemblies, on, matters, of, law, and, policy, and, as, jurors, but, only, the, three, highest, classes, of, citizens, could, vote, in, elections, nor, were, the, lowest, of, the, four, classes, of, athenian, citizens, as, defined, by, the, extent, of, their, wealth, and, property, rather, than, by, birth, eligible, to, hold, public, office, through, the, reforms, of, solon, the, spartan, election, of, the, ephors, therefore, also, predates, the, reforms, of, solon, in, athens, by, approximately, 180, years, questions, of, suffrage, especially, suffrage, for, minority, groups, have, dominated, the, history, of, elections, males, the, dominant, cultural, group, in, north, america, and, europe, often, dominated, the, electorate, and, continue, to, do, so, in, many, countries, early, elections, in, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, were, dominated, by, landed, or, ruling, class, males, however, by, 1920, all, western, european, and, north, american, democracies, had, universal, adult, male, suffrage, except, switzerland, and, many, countries, began, to, consider, women, s, suffrage, despite, legally, mandated, universal, suffrage, for, adult, males, political, barriers, were, sometimes, erected, to, prevent, fair, access, to, elections, see, civil, rights, movement, elections, are, held, in, a, variety, of, political, organizational, and, corporate, settings, many, countries, hold, elections, to, select, people, to, serve, in, their, governments, but, other, types, of, organizations, hold, elections, as, well, for, example, many, corporations, hold, elections, among, shareholders, to, select, a, board, of, directors, and, these, elections, may, be, mandated, by, corporate, law, in, many, places, an, election, to, the, government, is, usually, a, competition, among, people, who, have, already, won, a, primary, election, within, a, political, party, elections, within, corporations, and, other, organizations, often, use, procedures, and, rules, that, are, similar, to, those, of, governmental, elections, the, question, of, who, may, vote, is, a, central, issue, in, elections, the, electorate, does, not, generally, include, the, entire, population, for, example, many, countries, prohibit, those, who, are, under, the, age, of, majority, from, voting, all, jurisdictions, require, a, minimum, age, for, voting, in, australia, aboriginal, people, were, not, given, the, right, to, vote, until, 1962, see, 1967, referendum, entry, and, in, 2010, the, federal, government, removed, the, rights, of, prisoners, serving, for, three, years, or, more, to, vote, a, large, proportion, of, which, were, aboriginal, australians, suffrage, is, typically, only, for, citizens, of, the, country, though, further, limits, may, be, imposed, however, in, the, european, union, one, can, vote, in, municipal, elections, if, one, lives, in, the, municipality, and, is, an, eu, citizen, the, nationality, of, the, country, of, residence, is, not, required, in, some, countries, voting, is, required, by, law, eligible, voters, may, be, subject, to, punitive, measures, such, as, a, fine, for, not, casting, a, vote, in, western, australia, the, penalty, for, a, first, time, offender, failing, to, vote, is, a, 20, 00, fine, which, increases, to, 50, 00, if, the, offender, refused, to, vote, prior, historically, the, size, of, eligible, voters, the, electorate, was, small, having, the, size, of, groups, or, communities, of, privileged, men, like, aristocrats, and, men, of, a, city, citizens, with, the, growth, of, the, number, of, people, with, bourgeois, citizen, rights, outside, of, cities, expanding, the, term, citizen, the, electorates, grew, to, numbers, beyond, the, thousands, elections, with, an, electorate, in, the, hundred, thousands, appeared, in, the, final, decades, of, the, roman, republic, by, extending, voting, rights, to, citizens, outside, of, rome, with, the, lex, julia, of, 90, bc, reaching, an, electorate, of, 910, 000, and, estimated, voter, turnout, of, maximum, 10, in, 70, bc, only, again, comparable, in, size, to, the, first, elections, of, the, united, states, at, the, same, time, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, had, in, 1780, about, 214, 000, eligible, voters, 3, of, the, whole, population, naturalization, can, reshape, the, electorate, of, a, country, a, representative, democracy, requires, a, procedure, to, govern, nomination, for, political, office, in, many, cases, nomination, for, office, is, mediated, through, preselection, processes, in, organized, political, parties, non, partisan, systems, tend, to, be, different, from, partisan, systems, as, concerns, nominations, in, a, direct, democracy, one, type, of, non, partisan, democracy, any, eligible, person, can, be, nominated, although, elections, were, used, in, ancient, athens, in, rome, and, in, the, selection, of, popes, and, holy, roman, emperors, the, origins, of, elections, in, the, contemporary, world, lie, in, the, gradual, emergence, of, representative, government, in, europe, and, north, america, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, in, some, systems, no, nominations, take, place, at, all, with, voters, free, to, choose, any, person, at, the, time, of, voting, with, some, possible, exceptions, such, as, through, a, minimum, age, requirement, in, the, jurisdiction, in, such, cases, it, is, not, required, or, even, possible, that, the, members, of, the, electorate, be, familiar, with, all, of, the, eligible, persons, though, such, systems, may, involve, indirect, elections, at, larger, geographic, levels, to, ensure, that, some, first, hand, familiarity, among, potential, electees, can, exist, at, these, levels, i, e, among, the, elected, delegates, electoral, systems, are, the, detailed, constitutional, arrangements, and, voting, systems, that, convert, the, vote, into, a, political, decision, the, first, step, is, for, voters, to, cast, the, ballots, which, may, be, simple, single, choice, ballots, but, other, types, such, as, multiple, choice, or, ranked, ballots, may, also, be, used, then, the, votes, are, tallied, for, which, various, vote, counting, systems, may, be, used, and, the, voting, system, then, determines, the, result, on, the, basis, of, the, tally, most, systems, can, be, categorized, as, either, proportional, majoritarian, or, mixed, among, the, proportional, systems, the, most, commonly, used, are, party, list, proportional, representation, list, pr, systems, among, majoritarian, are, first, past, the, post, electoral, system, single, winner, plurality, voting, and, different, methods, of, majority, voting, such, as, the, widely, used, two, round, system, mixed, systems, combine, elements, of, both, proportional, and, majoritarian, methods, with, some, typically, producing, results, closer, to, the, former, mixed, member, proportional, or, the, other, e, g, parallel, voting, many, countries, have, growing, electoral, reform, movements, which, advocate, systems, such, as, approval, voting, single, transferable, vote, instant, runoff, voting, or, a, condorcet, method, these, methods, are, also, gaining, popularity, for, lesser, elections, in, some, countries, where, more, important, elections, still, use, more, traditional, counting, methods, while, openness, and, accountability, are, usually, considered, cornerstones, of, a, democratic, system, the, act, of, casting, a, vote, and, the, content, of, a, voter, s, ballot, are, usually, an, important, exception, the, secret, ballot, is, a, relatively, modern, development, but, it, is, now, considered, crucial, in, most, free, and, fair, elections, as, it, limits, the, effectiveness, of, intimidation, when, elections, are, called, politicians, and, their, supporters, attempt, to, influence, policy, by, competing, directly, for, the, votes, of, constituents, in, what, are, called, campaigns, supporters, for, a, campaign, can, be, either, formally, organized, or, loosely, affiliated, and, frequently, utilize, campaign, advertising, it, is, common, for, political, scientists, to, attempt, to, predict, elections, via, political, forecasting, methods, the, most, expensive, election, campaign, included, us, 7, billion, spent, on, the, 2012, united, states, presidential, election, and, is, followed, by, the, us, 5, billion, spent, on, the, 2014, indian, general, election, the, nature, of, democracy, is, that, elected, officials, are, accountable, to, the, people, and, they, must, return, to, the, voters, at, prescribed, intervals, to, seek, their, mandate, to, continue, in, office, for, that, reason, most, democratic, constitutions, provide, that, elections, are, held, at, fixed, regular, intervals, in, the, united, states, elections, for, public, offices, are, typically, held, between, every, two, and, six, years, in, most, states, and, at, the, federal, level, with, exceptions, for, elected, judicial, positions, that, may, have, longer, terms, of, office, there, is, a, variety, of, schedules, for, example, presidents, the, president, of, ireland, is, elected, every, seven, years, the, president, of, russia, and, the, president, of, finland, every, six, years, the, president, of, france, every, five, years, president, of, the, united, states, every, four, years, pre, decided, or, fixed, election, dates, have, the, advantage, of, fairness, and, predictability, however, they, tend, to, greatly, lengthen, campaigns, and, make, dissolving, the, legislature, parliamentary, system, more, problematic, if, the, date, should, happen, to, fall, at, a, time, when, dissolution, is, inconvenient, e, g, when, war, breaks, out, other, states, e, g, the, united, kingdom, only, set, maximum, time, in, office, and, the, executive, decides, exactly, when, within, that, limit, it, will, actually, go, to, the, polls, in, practice, this, means, the, government, remains, in, power, for, close, to, its, full, term, and, chooses, an, election, date, it, calculates, to, be, in, its, best, interests, unless, something, special, happens, such, as, a, motion, of, no, confidence, this, calculation, depends, on, a, number, of, variables, such, as, its, performance, in, opinion, polls, and, the, size, of, its, majority, rolling, elections, are, elections, in, which, all, representatives, in, a, body, are, elected, but, these, elections, are, spread, over, a, period, of, time, rather, than, all, at, once, examples, are, the, presidential, primaries, in, the, united, states, elections, to, the, european, parliament, where, due, to, differing, election, laws, in, each, member, state, elections, are, held, on, different, days, of, the, same, week, and, due, to, logistics, general, elections, in, lebanon, and, india, the, voting, procedure, in, the, legislative, assemblies, of, the, roman, republic, are, also, a, classical, example, in, rolling, elections, voters, have, information, about, previous, voters, choices, while, in, the, first, elections, there, may, be, plenty, of, hopeful, candidates, in, the, last, rounds, consensus, on, one, winner, is, generally, achieved, in, today, s, context, of, rapid, communication, candidates, can, put, disproportionate, resources, into, competing, strongly, in, the, first, few, stages, because, those, stages, affect, the, reaction, of, latter, stages, in, many, of, the, countries, with, weak, rule, of, law, the, most, common, reason, why, elections, do, not, meet, international, standards, of, being, free, and, fair, is, interference, from, the, incumbent, government, dictators, may, use, the, powers, of, the, executive, police, martial, law, censorship, physical, implementation, of, the, election, mechanism, etc, to, remain, in, power, despite, popular, opinion, in, favour, of, removal, members, of, a, particular, faction, in, a, legislature, may, use, the, power, of, the, majority, or, supermajority, passing, criminal, laws, and, defining, the, electoral, mechanisms, including, eligibility, and, district, boundaries, to, prevent, the, balance, of, power, in, the, body, from, shifting, to, a, rival, faction, due, to, an, election, non, governmental, entities, can, also, interfere, with, elections, through, physical, force, verbal, intimidation, or, fraud, which, can, result, in, improper, casting, or, counting, of, votes, monitoring, for, and, minimizing, electoral, fraud, is, also, an, ongoing, task, in, countries, with, strong, traditions, of, free, and, fair, elections, problems, that, prevent, an, election, from, being, free, and, fair, take, various, forms, the, electorate, may, be, poorly, informed, about, issues, or, candidates, due, to, lack, of, freedom, of, the, press, lack, of, objectivity, in, the, press, due, to, state, or, corporate, control, and, or, lack, of, access, to, news, and, political, media, freedom, of, speech, may, be, curtailed, by, the, state, favouring, certain, viewpoints, or, state, propaganda, gerrymandering, exclusion, of, opposition, candidates, from, eligibility, for, office, needlessly, high, restrictions, on, who, may, be, a, candidate, like, ballot, access, rules, and, manipulating, thresholds, for, electoral, success, are, some, of, the, ways, the, structure, of, an, election, can, be, changed, to, favour, a, specific, faction, or, candidate, scheduling, frequent, elections, can, also, lead, to, voter, fatigue, those, in, power, may, arrest, or, assassinate, candidates, suppress, or, even, criminalize, campaigning, close, campaign, headquarters, harass, or, beat, campaign, workers, or, intimidate, voters, with, violence, foreign, electoral, intervention, can, also, occur, with, the, united, states, interfering, between, 1946, and, 2000, in, 81, elections, and, russia, ussr, in, 36, in, 2018, the, most, intense, interventions, utilizing, false, information, were, by, china, in, taiwan, and, by, russia, in, latvia, the, next, highest, levels, were, in, bahrain, qatar, and, hungary, this, can, include, falsifying, voter, instructions, violation, of, the, secret, ballot, ballot, stuffing, tampering, with, voting, machines, destruction, of, legitimately, cast, ballots, voter, suppression, voter, registration, fraud, failure, to, validate, voter, residency, fraudulent, tabulation, of, results, and, use, of, physical, force, or, verbal, intimation, at, polling, places, other, examples, include, persuading, candidates, not, to, run, such, as, through, blackmailing, bribery, intimidation, or, physical, violence, a, sham, election, or, show, election, is, an, election, that, is, held, purely, for, show, that, is, without, any, significant, political, choice, or, real, impact, on, the, results, of, the, election, sham, elections, are, a, common, event, in, dictatorial, regimes, that, feel, the, need, to, feign, the, appearance, of, public, legitimacy, published, results, usually, show, nearly, 100, voter, turnout, and, high, support, typically, at, least, 80, and, close, to, 100, in, many, cases, for, the, prescribed, candidate, s, or, for, the, referendum, choice, that, favours, the, political, party, in, power, dictatorial, regimes, can, also, organize, sham, elections, with, results, simulating, those, that, might, be, achieved, in, democratic, countries, sometimes, only, one, government, approved, candidate, is, allowed, to, run, in, sham, elections, with, no, opposition, candidates, allowed, or, opposition, candidates, are, arrested, on, false, charges, or, even, without, any, charges, before, the, election, to, prevent, them, from, running, ballots, may, contain, only, one, yes, option, or, in, the, case, of, a, simple, yes, or, no, question, security, forces, often, persecute, people, who, pick, no, thus, encouraging, them, to, pick, the, yes, option, in, other, cases, those, who, vote, receive, stamps, in, their, passport, for, doing, so, while, those, who, did, not, vote, and, thus, do, not, receive, stamps, are, persecuted, as, enemies, of, the, people, sham, elections, can, sometimes, backfire, against, the, party, in, power, especially, if, the, regime, believes, they, are, popular, enough, to, win, without, coercion, fraud, or, suppressing, the, opposition, the, most, famous, example, of, this, was, the, 1990, myanmar, general, election, in, which, the, government, sponsored, national, unity, party, suffered, a, landslide, defeat, by, the, opposition, national, league, for, democracy, and, consequently, the, results, were, annulled, examples, of, sham, elections, include, the, presidential, and, parliamentary, elections, of, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, the, 1929, and, 1934, elections, in, fascist, italy, the, 1942, general, election, in, imperial, japan, those, in, nazi, germany, east, germany, the, 1940, elections, of, stalinist, people, s, parliaments, to, legitimise, the, soviet, occupation, of, estonia, latvia, and, lithuania, those, in, egypt, under, gamal, abdel, nasser, anwar, sadat, hosni, mubarak, and, abdel, fattah, el, sisi, those, in, bangladesh, under, sheikh, hasina, those, in, russia, under, vladimir, putin, including, the, 2014, crimean, status, referendum, as, well, as, the, 2014, donbass, status, referendums, and, the, 2022, annexation, referendum, in, russian, occupied, ukraine, the, 2018, and, 2024, venezuelan, presidential, election, the, 1928, 1935, 1942, 1949, 1951, and, 1958, elections, in, portugal, those, in, indonesia, during, new, order, regime, the, 1991, and, 2019, kazakh, presidential, elections, those, in, north, korea, the, 1995, and, 2002, presidential, referendums, in, saddam, hussein, s, iraq, in, mexico, all, of, the, presidential, elections, from, 1929, to, 1982, are, considered, to, be, sham, elections, as, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, pri, and, its, predecessors, governed, the, country, in, a, de, facto, single, party, system, without, serious, opposition, and, they, won, all, of, the, presidential, elections, in, that, period, with, more, than, 70, of, the, vote, the, first, seriously, competitive, presidential, election, in, modern, mexican, history, was, that, of, 1988, in, which, for, the, first, time, the, pri, candidate, faced, two, strong, opposition, candidates, though, it, is, believed, that, the, government, rigged, the, result, the, first, fair, election, was, held, in, 1994, though, the, opposition, did, not, win, until, 2000, a, predetermined, conclusion, is, permanently, established, by, the, regime, through, suppression, of, the, opposition, coercion, of, voters, vote, rigging, reporting, several, votes, received, greater, than, the, number, of, voters, outright, lying, or, some, combination, of, these, in, an, extreme, example, charles, d, b, king, of, liberia, was, reported, to, have, won, by, 234, 000, votes, in, the, 1927, general, election, a, majority, that, was, over, fifteen, times, larger, than, the, number, of, eligible, voters, some, scholars, argue, that, the, predominance, of, elections, in, modern, liberal, democracies, masks, the, fact, that, they, are, actually, aristocratic, selection, mechanisms, that, deny, each, citizen, an, equal, chance, of, holding, public, office, such, views, were, expressed, as, early, as, the, time, of, ancient, greece, by, aristotle, according, to, french, political, scientist, bernard, manin, the, inegalitarian, nature, of, elections, stems, from, four, factors, the, unequal, treatment, of, candidates, by, voters, the, distinction, of, candidates, required, by, choice, the, cognitive, advantage, conferred, by, salience, and, the, costs, of, disseminating, information, these, four, factors, result, in, the, evaluation, of, candidates, based, on, voters, partial, standards, of, quality, and, social, saliency, for, example, skin, colour, and, good, looks, this, leads, to, self, selection, biases, in, candidate, pools, due, to, unobjective, standards, of, treatment, by, voters, and, the, costs, barriers, to, entry, associated, with, raising, one, s, political, profile, ultimately, the, result, is, the, election, of, candidates, who, are, superior, whether, in, actuality, or, as, perceived, within, a, cultural, context, and, objectively, unlike, the, voters, they, are, supposed, to, represent, additionally, evidence, suggests, that, the, concept, of, electing, representatives, was, originally, conceived, to, be, different, from, democracy, prior, to, the, 18th, century, some, societies, in, western, europe, used, sortition, as, a, means, to, select, rulers, a, method, which, allowed, regular, citizens, to, exercise, power, in, keeping, with, understandings, of, democracy, at, the, time, however, the, idea, of, what, constituted, a, legitimate, government, shifted, in, the, 18th, century, to, include, consent, especially, with, the, rise, of, the, enlightenment, from, this, point, onwards, sortition, fell, out, of, favor, as, a, mechanism, for, selecting, rulers, on, the, other, hand, elections, began, to, be, seen, as, a, way, for, the, masses, to, express, popular, consent, repeatedly, resulting, in, the, triumph, of, the, electoral, process, until, the, present, day, this, conceptual, misunderstanding, of, elections, as, open, and, egalitarian, when, they, are, not, innately, so, may, thus, be, a, root, cause, of, the, problems, in, contemporary, governance, those, in, favor, of, this, view, argue, that, the, modern, system, of, elections, was, never, meant, to, give, ordinary, citizens, the, chance, to, exercise, power, merely, privileging, their, right, to, consent, to, those, who, rule, therefore, the, representatives, that, modern, electoral, systems, select, for, are, too, disconnected, unresponsive, and, elite, serving, to, deal, with, this, issue, various, scholars, have, proposed, alternative, models, of, democracy, many, of, which, include, a, return, to, sortition, based, selection, mechanisms, the, extent, to, which, sortition, should, be, the, dominant, mode, of, selecting, rulers, or, instead, be, hybridised, with, electoral, representation, remains, a, topic, of, debate
