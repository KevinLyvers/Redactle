the, regulatory, psychotherapeutic, organizations, codes, of, ethical, practice, examples, of, when, it, is, typically, accepted, to, break, confidentiality, include, when, the, therapist, has, knowledge, that, a, child, or, elder, is, being, physically, abused, when, there, is, a, direct, clear, and, imminent, threat, of, serious, physical, harm, to, self, or, to, a, specific, individual,

balances, psychotherapy, can, be, said, to, have, been, practiced, through, the, ages, as, medics, philosophers, spiritual, practitioners, and, people, in, general, used, psychological, methods, to, heal, others, in, the, western, tradition, by, the, 19th, century, a, moral, treatment, movement, then, meaning, morale, or, mental, developed, based, on, non, invasive, non, restraint, therapeutic, methods, another, influential, movement, was, started, by, franz, mesmer, 1734, 1815, and, his, student, armand, marie, jacques, de, chastenet, marquis, of, puys, gur, 1751, 1825, called, mesmerism, or, animal, magnetism, it, would, have, a, strong, influence, on, the, rise, of, dynamic, psychology, and, psychiatry, as, well, as, theories, about, hypnosis, in, 1853, walter, cooper, dendy, introduced, the, term, psycho, therapeia, regarding, how, physicians, might, influence, the, mental, states, of, patients, and, thus, their, bodily, ailments, for, example, by, creating, opposing, emotions, to, promote, mental, balance, daniel, hack, tuke, cited, the, term, and, wrote, about, psycho, therapeutics, in, 1872, in, which, he, also, proposed, making, a, science, of, animal, magnetism, hippolyte, bernheim, and, colleagues, in, the, nancy, school, developed, the, concept, of, psychotherapy, in, the, sense, of, using, the, mind, to, heal, the, body, through, hypnotism, yet, further, charles, lloyd, tuckey, s, 1889, work, psycho, therapeutics, or, treatment, by, hypnotism, and, suggestion, popularized, the, work, of, the, nancy, school, in, english, also, in, 1889, a, clinic, used, the, word, in, its, title, for, the, first, time, when, frederik, van, eeden, and, albert, willem, van, renterghem, in, amsterdam, renamed, theirs, clinique, de, psycho, th, rapeutique, suggestive, after, visiting, nancy, during, this, time, travelling, stage, hypnosis, became, popular, and, such, activities, added, to, the, scientific, controversies, around, the, use, of, hypnosis, in, medicine, also, in, 1892, at, the, second, congress, of, experimental, psychology, van, eeden, attempted, to, take, the, credit, for, the, term, psychotherapy, and, to, distance, the, term, from, hypnosis, in, 1896, the, german, journal, zeitschrift, f, r, hypnotismus, suggestionstherapie, suggestionslehre, und, verwandte, psychologische, forschungen, changed, its, name, to, zeitschrift, f, r, hypnotismus, psychotherapie, sowie, andere, psychophysiologische, und, psychopathologische, forschungen, which, is, probably, the, first, journal, to, use, the, term, thus, psychotherapy, initially, meant, the, treatment, of, disease, by, psychic, or, hypnotic, influence, or, by, suggestion, sigmund, freud, visited, the, nancy, school, and, his, early, neurological, practice, involved, the, use, of, hypnotism, however, following, the, work, of, his, mentor, josef, breuer, in, particular, a, case, where, symptoms, appeared, partially, resolved, by, what, the, patient, bertha, pappenheim, dubbed, a, talking, cure, freud, began, focusing, on, conditions, that, appeared, to, have, psychological, causes, originating, in, childhood, experiences, and, the, unconscious, mind, he, went, on, to, develop, techniques, such, as, free, association, dream, interpretation, transference, and, analysis, of, the, id, ego, and, superego, his, popular, reputation, as, the, father, of, psychotherapy, was, established, by, his, use, of, the, distinct, term, psychoanalysis, tied, to, an, overarching, system, of, theories, and, methods, and, by, the, effective, work, of, his, followers, in, rewriting, history, many, theorists, including, alfred, adler, carl, jung, karen, horney, anna, freud, otto, rank, erik, erikson, melanie, klein, and, heinz, kohut, built, upon, freud, s, fundamental, ideas, and, often, developed, their, own, systems, of, psychotherapy, these, were, all, later, categorized, as, psychodynamic, meaning, anything, that, involved, the, psyche, s, conscious, unconscious, influence, on, external, relationships, and, the, self, sessions, tended, to, number, into, the, hundreds, over, several, years, behaviorism, developed, in, the, 1920s, and, behavior, modification, as, a, therapy, became, popularized, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, notable, contributors, were, joseph, wolpe, in, south, africa, m, b, shapiro, and, hans, eysenck, in, britain, and, john, b, watson, and, b, f, skinner, in, the, united, states, behavioral, therapy, approaches, relied, on, principles, of, operant, conditioning, classical, conditioning, and, social, learning, theory, to, bring, about, therapeutic, change, in, observable, symptoms, the, approach, became, commonly, used, for, phobias, as, well, as, other, disorders, some, therapeutic, approaches, developed, out, of, the, european, school, of, existential, philosophy, concerned, mainly, with, the, individual, s, ability, to, develop, and, preserve, a, sense, of, meaning, and, purpose, throughout, life, major, contributors, to, the, field, e, g, irvin, yalom, rollo, may, and, europe, viktor, frankl, ludwig, binswanger, medard, boss, r, d, laing, emmy, van, deurzen, attempted, to, create, therapies, sensitive, to, common, life, crises, springing, from, the, essential, bleakness, of, human, self, awareness, previously, accessible, only, through, the, complex, writings, of, existential, philosophers, e, g, s, ren, kierkegaard, jean, paul, sartre, gabriel, marcel, martin, heidegger, friedrich, nietzsche, the, uniqueness, of, the, patient, therapist, relationship, thus, also, forms, a, vehicle, for, therapeutic, inquiry, a, related, body, of, thought, in, psychotherapy, started, in, the, 1950s, with, carl, rogers, based, also, on, the, works, of, abraham, maslow, and, his, hierarchy, of, human, needs, rogers, brought, person, centered, psychotherapy, into, mainstream, focus, the, primary, requirement, was, that, the, client, receive, three, core, conditions, from, his, counselor, or, therapist, unconditional, positive, regard, sometimes, described, as, prizing, the, client, s, humanity, congruence, and, empathic, understanding, this, type, of, interaction, was, thought, to, enable, clients, to, fully, experience, and, express, themselves, and, thus, develop, according, to, their, innate, potential, others, developed, the, approach, like, fritz, and, laura, perls, in, the, creation, of, gestalt, therapy, as, well, as, marshall, rosenberg, founder, of, nonviolent, communication, and, eric, berne, founder, of, transactional, analysis, later, these, fields, of, psychotherapy, would, become, what, is, known, as, humanistic, psychotherapy, today, self, help, groups, and, books, became, widespread, during, the, 1950s, albert, ellis, originated, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, rebt, independently, a, few, years, later, psychiatrist, aaron, t, beck, developed, a, form, of, psychotherapy, known, as, cognitive, therapy, both, of, these, included, relatively, short, structured, and, present, focused, techniques, aimed, at, identifying, and, changing, a, person, s, beliefs, appraisals, and, reaction, patterns, by, contrast, with, the, more, long, lasting, insight, based, approach, of, psychodynamic, or, humanistic, therapies, beck, s, approach, used, primarily, the, socratic, method, and, links, have, been, drawn, between, ancient, stoic, philosophy, and, these, cognitive, therapies, cognitive, and, behavioral, therapy, approaches, were, increasingly, combined, and, grouped, under, the, umbrella, term, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, in, the, 1970s, many, approaches, within, cbt, are, oriented, towards, active, directive, yet, collaborative, empiricism, a, form, of, reality, testing, and, assessing, and, modifying, core, beliefs, and, dysfunctional, schemas, these, approaches, gained, widespread, acceptance, as, a, primary, treatment, for, numerous, disorders, a, third, wave, of, cognitive, and, behavioral, therapies, developed, including, acceptance, and, commitment, therapy, and, dialectical, behavior, therapy, which, expanded, the, concepts, to, other, disorders, and, or, added, novel, components, and, mindfulness, exercises, however, the, third, wave, concept, has, been, criticized, as, not, essentially, different, from, other, therapies, and, having, roots, in, earlier, ones, as, well, counseling, methods, developed, include, solution, focused, therapy, and, systemic, coaching, postmodern, psychotherapies, such, as, narrative, therapy, and, coherence, therapy, do, not, impose, definitions, of, mental, health, and, illness, but, rather, see, the, goal, of, therapy, as, something, constructed, by, the, client, and, therapist, in, a, social, context, systemic, therapy, also, developed, which, focuses, on, family, and, group, dynamics, and, transpersonal, psychology, which, focuses, on, the, spiritual, facet, of, human, experience, other, orientations, developed, in, the, last, three, decades, include, feminist, therapy, brief, therapy, somatic, psychology, expressive, therapy, applied, positive, psychology, and, the, human, givens, approach, a, survey, of, over, 2, 500, us, therapists, in, 2006, revealed, the, most, utilized, models, of, therapy, and, the, ten, most, influential, therapists, of, the, previous, quarter, century, there, are, hundreds, of, psychotherapy, approaches, or, schools, of, thought, by, 1980, there, were, more, than, 250, by, 1996, more, than, 450, and, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, there, were, over, a, thousand, different, named, psychotherapies, some, being, minor, variations, while, others, are, based, on, very, different, conceptions, of, psychology, ethics, how, to, live, or, technique, in, practice, therapy, is, often, not, of, one, pure, type, but, draws, from, a, number, of, perspectives, and, schools, known, as, an, integrative, or, eclectic, approach, the, importance, of, the, therapeutic, relationship, also, known, as, therapeutic, alliance, between, client, and, therapist, is, often, regarded, as, crucial, to, psychotherapy, common, factors, theory, addresses, this, and, other, core, aspects, thought, to, be, responsible, for, effective, psychotherapy, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, a, viennese, neurologist, who, studied, with, jean, martin, charcot, in, 1885, is, often, considered, the, father, of, modern, psychotherapy, his, methods, included, analyzing, his, patient, s, dreams, in, search, of, important, hidden, insights, into, their, unconscious, minds, other, major, elements, of, his, methods, which, changed, throughout, the, years, included, identification, of, childhood, sexuality, the, role, of, anxiety, as, a, manifestation, of, inner, conflict, the, differentiation, of, parts, of, the, psyche, id, ego, superego, transference, and, countertransference, the, patient, s, projections, onto, the, therapist, and, the, therapist, s, emotional, responses, to, that, some, of, his, concepts, were, too, broad, to, be, amenable, to, empirical, testing, and, invalidation, and, he, was, critiqued, for, this, by, jaspers, numerous, major, figures, elaborated, and, refined, freud, s, therapeutic, techniques, including, melanie, klein, donald, winnicott, and, others, since, the, 1960s, however, the, use, of, freudian, based, analysis, for, the, treatment, of, mental, disorders, has, declined, substantially, different, types, of, psychotherapy, have, been, created, along, with, the, advent, of, clinical, trials, to, test, them, scientifically, these, incorporate, subjective, treatments, after, beck, behavioral, treatments, after, skinner, and, wolpe, and, additional, time, constrained, and, centered, structures, for, example, interpersonal, psychotherapy, in, youth, issue, and, in, schizophrenia, the, systems, of, family, treatment, hold, esteem, a, portion, of, the, thoughts, emerging, from, therapy, are, presently, pervasive, and, some, are, a, piece, of, the, tool, set, of, ordinary, clinical, practice, they, are, not, just, medications, they, additionally, help, to, understand, complex, conduct, therapy, may, address, specific, forms, of, diagnosable, mental, illness, or, everyday, problems, in, managing, or, maintaining, interpersonal, relationships, or, meeting, personal, goals, a, course, of, therapy, may, happen, before, during, or, after, pharmacotherapy, e, g, taking, psychiatric, medication, psychotherapies, are, categorized, in, several, different, ways, a, distinction, can, be, made, between, those, based, on, a, medical, model, and, those, based, on, a, humanistic, model, in, the, medical, model, the, client, is, seen, as, unwell, and, the, therapist, employs, their, skill, to, help, the, client, back, to, health, the, extensive, use, of, the, dsm, iv, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, in, the, united, states, is, an, example, of, a, medically, exclusive, model, the, humanistic, or, non, medical, model, in, contrast, strives, to, depathologise, the, human, condition, the, therapist, attempts, to, create, a, relational, environment, conducive, to, experiential, learning, and, help, build, the, client, s, confidence, in, their, own, natural, process, resulting, in, a, deeper, understanding, of, themselves, the, therapist, may, see, themselves, as, a, facilitator, helper, another, distinction, is, between, individual, one, to, one, therapy, sessions, and, group, psychotherapy, including, couples, therapy, and, family, therapy, therapies, are, sometimes, classified, according, to, their, duration, a, small, number, of, sessions, over, a, few, weeks, or, months, may, be, classified, as, brief, therapy, or, short, term, therapy, others, where, regular, sessions, take, place, for, years, may, be, classified, as, long, term, some, practitioners, distinguish, between, more, uncovering, or, depth, approaches, and, more, supportive, psychotherapy, uncovering, psychotherapy, emphasizes, facilitating, the, client, s, insight, into, the, roots, of, their, difficulties, the, best, known, example, is, classical, psychoanalysis, supportive, psychotherapy, by, contrast, stresses, strengthening, the, client, s, coping, mechanisms, and, often, providing, encouragement, and, advice, as, well, as, reality, testing, and, limit, setting, where, necessary, depending, on, the, client, s, issues, and, situation, a, more, supportive, or, more, uncovering, approach, may, be, optimal, these, psychotherapies, also, known, as, experiential, are, based, on, humanistic, psychology, and, emerged, in, reaction, to, both, behaviorism, and, psychoanalysis, being, dubbed, the, third, force, they, are, primarily, concerned, with, the, human, development, and, needs, of, the, individual, with, an, emphasis, on, subjective, meaning, a, rejection, of, determinism, and, a, concern, for, positive, growth, rather, than, pathology, some, posit, an, inherent, human, capacity, to, maximize, potential, the, self, actualizing, tendency, the, task, of, therapy, is, to, create, a, relational, environment, where, this, tendency, might, flourish, humanistic, psychology, can, in, turn, be, rooted, in, existentialism, the, belief, that, human, beings, can, only, find, meaning, by, creating, it, this, is, the, goal, of, existential, therapy, existential, therapy, is, in, turn, philosophically, associated, with, phenomenology, person, centered, therapy, also, known, as, client, centered, focuses, on, the, therapist, showing, openness, empathy, and, unconditional, positive, regard, to, help, clients, express, and, develop, their, own, self, humanistic, psychodrama, hpd, is, based, on, the, human, image, of, humanistic, psychology, so, all, rules, and, methods, follow, the, axioms, of, humanistic, psychology, the, hpd, sees, itself, as, development, oriented, psychotherapy, and,

existential, experiential, form, that, facilitates, awareness, in, the, various, contexts, of, life, by, moving, from, talking, about, relatively, remote, situations, to, action, and, direct, current, experience, derived, from, various, influences, including, an, overhaul, of, psychoanalysis, it, stands, on, top, of, essentially, four, load, bearing, theoretical, walls, phenomenological, method, dialogical, relationship, field, theoretical, strategies, and, experimental, freedom, a, briefer, form, of, humanistic, therapy, is, the, human, givens, approach, introduced, in, 1998, 99, it, is, a, solution, focused, intervention, based, on, identifying, emotional, needs, such, as, for, security, autonomy, and, social, connection, and, using, various, educational, and, psychological, methods, to, help, people, meet, those, needs, more, fully, or, appropriately, insight, oriented, psychotherapies, focus, on, revealing, or, interpreting, unconscious, processes, most, commonly, referring, to, psychodynamic, therapy, of, which, psychoanalysis, is, the, oldest, and, most, intensive, form, these, applications, of, depth, psychology, encourage, the, verbalization, of, all, the, patient, s, thoughts, including, free, associations, fantasies, and, dreams, from, which, the, analyst, formulates, the, nature, of, the, past, and, present, unconscious, conflicts, which, are, causing, the, patient, s, symptoms, and, character, problems, there, are, six, main, schools, of, psychoanalysis, which, all, influenced, psychodynamic, theory, freudian, ego, psychology, object, relations, theory, self, psychology, interpersonal, psychoanalysis, and, relational, psychoanalysis, techniques, for, analytic, group, therapy, have, also, developed, behavior, therapies, use, behavioral, techniques, including, applied, behavior, analysis, also, known, as, behavior, modification, to, change, maladaptive, patterns, of, behavior, to, improve, emotional, responses, cognitions, and, interactions, with, others, functional, analytic, psychotherapy, is, one, form, of, this, approach, by, nature, behavioral, therapies, are, empirical, data, driven, contextual, focused, on, the, environment, and,

emotions, and, behaviors, generally, in, cbt, the, therapist, through, a, wide, array, of, modalities, helps, clients, assess, recognize, and, deal, with, problematic, and, dysfunctional, ways, of,

psychiatric, association, apa, state, that, cbt, drawing, primarily, on, behavioral, techniques, such, as, erp, has, the, strongest, evidence, base, among, psychosocial, interventions, by, confronting, feared, scenarios, i, e, exposure, and, refraining, from, performing, rituals, i, e, responsive, prevention, patients, may, gradually, feel, less, distress, in, confronting, feared, stimuli, while, also, feeling, less, inclination, to, use, rituals, to, relieve, that, distress, typically, erp, is, delivered, in, hierarchical, fashion, meaning, patients, confront, increasingly, anxiety, provoking, stimuli, as, they, progress, through, a, course, of, treatment, other, types, include, reality, therapy, choice, theory, multimodal, therapy, and, therapies, for, specific, disorders, including, ptsd, therapies, such, as, cognitive, processing, therapy, substance, abuse, therapies, such, as, relapse, prevention, and, contingency, management, and, co, occurring, disorders, therapies, such, as, seeking, safety, systemic, therapy, seeks, to, address, people, not, just, individually, as, is, often, the, focus, of, other, forms, of, therapy, but, in,

psychology, the, term, group, therapy, was, first, used, around, 1920, by, jacob, l, moreno, whose, main, contribution, was, the, development, of, psychodrama, in, which, groups, were, used, as, both, cast, and, audience, for, the, exploration, of, individual, problems, by, reenactment, under, the, direction, of, the, leader, the, more, analytic, and, exploratory, use, of, groups, in, both, hospital, and, out, patient, settings, was, pioneered, by, a, few, european, psychoanalysts, who, emigrated, to, the, us, such, as, paul, schilder, who, treated, severely, neurotic, and, mildly, psychotic, out, patients, in, small, groups, at, bellevue, hospital, new, york, the, power, of, groups, was, most, influentially, demonstrated, in, britain, during, the, second, world, war, when, several, psychoanalysts, and, psychiatrists, proved, the, value, of, group, methods, for, officer, selection, in, the, war, office, selection, boards, a, chance, to, run, an, army, psychiatric, unit, on, group, lines, was, then, given, to, several, of, these, pioneers, notably, wilfred, bion, and, rickman, followed, by, s, h, foulkes, main, and, bridger, the, northfield, hospital, in, birmingham, gave, its, name, to, what, came, to, be, called, the, two, northfield, experiments, which, provided, the, impetus, for, the, development, since, the, war, of, both, social, therapy, that, is, the, therapeutic, community, movement, and, the, use, of, small, groups, for, the, treatment, of, neurotic, and, personality, disorders, today, group, therapy, is, used, in, clinical, settings, and, in,

dance, therapy, drama, therapy, art, therapy, music, therapy, writing, therapy, among, others, this, may, include, techniques, such, as, affect, labeling, expressive, psychotherapists, believe, that, often, the, most, effective, way, of, treating, a, client, is, through, the, expression, of, imagination, in, creative, work, and, integrating, and, processing, what, issues, are, raised, in, the, act, also, known, as, post, structuralist, or, constructivist, narrative, therapy, gives, attention, to, each, person, s, dominant, story, through, therapeutic, conversations, which, also, may, involve, exploring, unhelpful, ideas, and, how, they, came, to, prominence, possible, social, and, cultural, influences, may, be, explored, if, the, client, deems, it, helpful, coherence, therapy, posits, multiple, levels, of, mental, constructs, that, create, symptoms, as, a, way, to, strive, for, self, protection, or, self, realization, feminist, therapy, does, not, accept, that, there, is,

positive, image, of, humans, with, a, health, promoting, resource, oriented, and, conflict, centered, approach, hypnotherapy, is, undertaken, while, a, subject, is, in, a, state, of, hypnosis, hypnotherapy, is, often, applied, in, order, to, modify, a, subject, s, behavior, emotional, content, and, attitudes, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, conditions, including, dysfunctional, habits, anxiety, stress, related, illness, pain, management, and, personal, development, psychedelic, therapy, are, therapeutic, practices, involving, psychedelic, drugs, such, as, lsd, psilocybin, dmt, and,

psychotherapy, session, during, the, acute, psychedelic, activity, with, additional, sessions, both, before, and, after, in, order, to, help, integrate, experiences, with, the, psychedelics, psychedelic, therapy, has, been, compared, with, the, shamanic, healing, rituals, of, indigenous, people, researchers, identified, two, main, differences, the, first, is, the, shamanic, belief, that, multiple, realities, exist, and, can, be, explored, through, altered, states, of, consciousness, and, second, the, belief, that, spirits, encountered, in, dreams, and, visions, are, real, the,

psychotherapy, part, of, the, field, of, somatic, psychology, focuses, on, the, link, between, the, mind, and, the, body, and, tries, to, access, deeper, levels, of, the, psyche, through, greater, awareness, of, the, physical, body, and, emotions, there, are, various, body, oriented, approaches, such, as, reichian, wilhelm, reich, character, analytic, vegetotherapy, and, orgonomy, neo, reichian, bioenergetic, analysis, somatic, experiencing, integrative, body, psychotherapy, ron, kurtz, s, hakomi, psychotherapy, sensorimotor, psychotherapy, biosynthesis, psychotherapy, and, biodynamic, psychotherapy, these, approaches, are, not, to, be, confused, with, body, work, or, body, therapies, that, seek, to, improve, primarily, physical, health, through, direct, work, touch, and, manipulation, on, the, body, rather, than, through, directly, psychological, methods, some, non, western, indigenous, therapies, have, been, developed, in, african, countries, this, includes, harmony, restoration, therapy, meseron, therapy, and, systemic, therapies, based, on, the, ubuntu, philosophy, integrative, psychotherapy, is, an, attempt, to, combine, ideas, and, strategies, from, more, than, one, theoretical, approach, these, approaches, include, mixing, core, beliefs, and, combining, proven, techniques, forms, of, integrative, psychotherapy, include, multimodal, therapy, the, transtheoretical, model, cyclical, psychodynamics, systematic, treatment, selection, cognitive, analytic, therapy, internal, family, systems, model, multitheoretical, psychotherapy, and, conceptual,

children, depending, on, age, it, is, generally, held, to, be, one, part, of, an, effective, strategy, to, help, the, needs, of, a, child, within, the, family, setting, child, psychotherapy, training, programs, necessarily, include, courses, in, human, development, since, children, often, do, not, have, the, ability, to, articulate, thoughts, and, feelings, psychotherapists, will, use, a, variety, of, media, such, as, musical, instruments, sand, and, toys, crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling, books, or, board, games, the, use, of, play, therapy, is, often, rooted, in, psychodynamic, theory, but, other, approaches, also, exist, in, addition, to, therapy, for, the, child, sometimes, instead, of, it, children, may, benefit, if, their, parents, work, with, a, therapist, take, parenting, classes, attend, grief, counseling, or, take, other, action, to, resolve, stressful, situations, that, affect, the, child, parent, management, training, is, a, highly, effective, form, of, psychotherapy, that, teaches, parenting, skills, to, reduce, their, child, s, behavior, problems, in, many, cases, a, different, psychotherapist, will, work, with, the, care, taker, of, the, child, while, a, colleague, works, with, the, child, therefore, contemporary, thinking, on, working, with, the, younger, age, group, has, leaned, towards, working, with, parent, and, child, simultaneously, as, well, as, individually, as, needed, research, on, computer, supported, and, computer, based, interventions, has, increased, significantly, over, the, course, of, the, last, two, decades, the, following, applications, frequently, have, been, investigated, telepsychiatry, or, telemental, health, refers, to, the, use, of, telecommunications, technology, mostly, videoconferencing, and, phone, calls, to, deliver, psychiatric, care, remotely, for, people, with, mental, health, conditions, it, is, a, branch, of, telemedicine, telepsychiatry, can, be, effective, in, treating, people, with, mental, health, conditions, in, the, short, term, it, can, be, as, acceptable, and, effective, as, face, to, face, care, it, can, improve, access, to, mental, health, services, for, some, but, might, also, represent, a, barrier, for, those, lacking, access, to, a, suitable, device, the, internet, or, the, necessary, digital, skills, factors, such, as, poverty, that, are, associated, with, lack, of, internet, access, are, also, associated, with, greater, risk, of, mental, health, problems, making, digital, exclusion, an, important, problem, of, telemental, health, services, there, is, considerable, controversy, about, whether, or, when, psychotherapy, efficacy, is, best, evaluated, by, randomized, controlled, trials, or, more, individualized, idiographic, methods, one, issue, with, trials, is, what, to, use, as, a, placebo, treatment, group, or, non, treatment, control, group, often, this, group, includes, patients, on, a, waiting, list, or, those, receiving, some, kind, of, regular, non, specific, contact, or, support, researchers, must, consider, how, best, to, match, the, use, of, inert, tablets, or, sham, treatments, in, placebo, controlled, studies, in, pharmaceutical, trials, several, interpretations, and, differing, assumptions, and, language, remain, another, issue, is, the, attempt, to, standardize, and, manualize, therapies, and, link, them, to, specific, symptoms, of, diagnostic, categories, making, them, more, amenable, to, research, some, report, that, this, may, reduce, efficacy, or, gloss, over, individual, needs, fonagy, and, roth, s, opinion, is, that, the, benefits, of, the, evidence, based, approach, outweighs, the, difficulties, there, are, several, formal, frameworks, for, evaluating, whether, a, psychotherapist, is, a, good, fit, for, a, patient, one, example, is, the, scarsdale, psychotherapy, self, evaluation, spse, however, some, scales, such, as, the, sps, elicit, information, specific, to, certain, schools, of, psychotherapy, alone, e, g, the, superego, many, psychotherapists, believe, that, the, nuances, of, psychotherapy, cannot, be, captured, by, questionnaire, style, observation, and, prefer, to, rely, on, their, own, clinical, experiences, and, conceptual, arguments, to, support, the, type, of, treatment, they, practice, psychodynamic, therapists, increasingly, believe, that, evidence, based, approaches, are, appropriate, to, their, methods, and, assumptions, and, have, increasingly, accepted, the, challenge, to, implement, evidence, based, approaches, in, their, methods, a, pioneer, in, investigating, the, results, of, different, psychological, therapies, was, psychologist, hans, eysenck, who, argued, that, psychotherapy, does, not, produce, any, improvement, in, patients, he, held, that, behavior, therapy, is, the, only, effective, one, however, it, was, revealed, that, eysenck, who, died, in, 1997, falsified, data, in, his, studies, about, this, subject, fabricating, data, that, would, indicate, that, behavioral, therapy, enables, achievements, that, are, impossible, to, believe, fourteen, of, his, papers, were, retracted, by, journals, in, 2020, and, journals, issued, 64, statements, of, concern, about, publications, by, him, rod, buchanan, a, biographer, of, eysenck, has, argued, that, 87, publications, by, eysenck, should, be, retracted, the, response, rate, of, psychotherapy, varies, no, reliable, changes, due, to, psychotherapy, can, be, found, in, up, to, 33, of, patients, large, scale, international, reviews, of, scientific, studies, have, concluded, that, psychotherapy, is, effective, for, numerous, conditions, a, 2022, meta, analysis, of, meta, analyses, found, that, effect, sizes, reported, for, both, psychotherapies, and, pharmacotherapies, compared, to, treatment, as, usual, or, placebo, were, small, for, most, disorders, and, treatments, and, concluded, that, a, paradigm, shift, in, research, was, needed, to, advance, the, field, and, improve, treatment, strategies, for, mental, disorders, one, line, of, research, consistently, found, that, supposedly, different, forms, of, psychotherapy, show, similar, effectiveness, according, to, the, 2008, edition, of, the, handbook, of, counseling, psychology, meta, analyses, of, psychotherapy, studies, have, consistently, demonstrated, that, there, are, no, substantial, differences, in, outcomes, among, treatments, the, handbook, stated, that, little, evidence, suggests, that, any, one, treatment, consistently, outperforms, any, other, for, any, specific, psychological, disorders, this, is, sometimes, called, the, dodo, bird, verdict, after, a, scene, section, in, alice, in, wonderland, where, every, competitor, in, a, race, was, called, a, winner, and, is, given, prizes, further, analyses, seek, to, identify, the, factors, that, the, psychotherapies, have, in, common, that, seem, to, account, for, this, known, as, common, factors, theory, for, example, the, quality, of, the, therapeutic, relationship, interpretation, of, problem, and, the, confrontation, of, painful, emotions, outcome, studies, have, been, critiqued, for, being, too, removed, from, real, world, practice, in, that, they, use, carefully, selected, therapists, who, have, been, extensively, trained, and, monitored, and, patients, who, may, be, non, representative, of, typical, patients, by, virtue, of, strict, inclusionary, exclusionary, criteria, such, concerns, impact, the, replication, of, research, results, and, the, ability, to, generalize, from, them, to, practicing, therapists, however, specific, therapies, have, been, tested, for, use, with, specific, disorders, and, regulatory, organizations, in, both, the, uk, and, us, make, recommendations, for, different, conditions, the, helsinki, psychotherapy, study, was, one, of, several, large, long, term, clinical, trials, of, psychotherapies, that, have, taken, place, anxious, and, depressed, patients, in, two, short, term, therapies, solution, focused, and, brief, psychodynamic, improved, faster, but, five, years, long, term, psychotherapy, and, psychoanalysis, gave, greater, benefits, several, patient, and, therapist, factors, appear, to, predict, suitability, for, different, psychotherapies, meta, analyses, have, established, that, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, cbt, and, psychodynamic, psychotherapy, are, equally, effective, in, treating, depression, a, 2014, meta, analysis, over, 11, 000, patients, reveals, that, interpersonal, psychotherapy, ipt, is, of, comparable, effectiveness, to, cbt, for, depression, but, is, inferior, to, the, latter, for, eating, disorders, for, children, and, adolescents, interpersonal, psychotherapy, and, cbt, are, the, best, methods, according, to, a, 2014, meta, analysis, of, almost, 4000, patients, research, on, adverse, effects, of, psychotherapy, has, been, limited, yet, worsening, of, symptoms, may, be, expected, to, occur, in, 3, to, 15, of, patients, with, variability, across, patient, and, therapist, characteristics, potential, problems, include, deterioration, of, symptoms, or, developing, new, symptoms, strains, in, other, relationships, social, stigma, and, therapy, dependence, some, techniques, or, therapists, may, carry, more, risks, than, others, and, some, client, characteristics, may, make, them, more, vulnerable, side, effects, from, properly, conducted, therapy, should, be, distinguished, from, harms, caused, by, malpractice, patient, adherence, to, a, course, of, psychotherapy, continuing, to, attend, sessions, or, complete, tasks, is, a, major, issue, the, dropout, level, early, termination, ranges, from, around, 30, to, 60, depending, partly, on, how, it, is, defined, the, range, is, lower, for, research, settings, for, various, reasons, such, as, the, selection, of, clients, and, how, they, are, inducted, early, termination, is, associated, on, average, with, various, demographic, and, clinical, characteristics, of, clients, therapists, and, treatment, interactions, the, high, level, of, dropout, has, raised, some, criticism, about, the, relevance, and, efficacy, of, psychotherapy, most, psychologists, use, between, session, tasks, in, their, general, therapy, work, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapies, in, particular, use, and, see, them, as, an, active, ingredient, it, is, not, clear, how, often, clients, do, not, complete, them, but, it, is, thought, to, be, a, pervasive, phenomenon, from, the, other, side, the, adherence, of, therapists, to, therapy, protocols, and, techniques, known, as, treatment, integrity, or, fidelity, has, also, been, studied, with, complex, mixed, results, in, general, however, it, is, a, hallmark, of, evidence, based, psychotherapy, to, use, fidelity, monitoring, as, part, of, therapy, outcome, trials, and, ongoing, quality, assurance, in, clinical, implementation, it, is, not, yet, understood, how, psychotherapies, can, succeed, in, treating, mental, illnesses, different, therapeutic, approaches, may, be, associated, with, particular, theories, about, what, needs, to, change, in, a, person, for, a, successful, therapeutic, outcome, in, general, processes, of, emotional, arousal, and, memory, have, long, been, held, to, play, an, important, role, one, theory, combining, these, aspects, proposes, that, permanent, change, occurs, to, the, extent, that, the, neuropsychological, mechanism, of, memory, reconsolidation, is, triggered, and, is, able, to, incorporate, new, emotional, experiences, some, critics, are, skeptical, of, the, healing, power, of, psychotherapeutic, relationships, some, dismiss, psychotherapy, altogether, in, the, sense, of, a, scientific, discipline, requiring, professional, practitioners, instead, favoring, either, nonprofessional, help, or, biomedical, treatments, others, have, pointed, out, ways, in, which, the, values, and, techniques, of, therapists, can, be, harmful, as, well, as, helpful, to, clients, or, indirectly, to, other, people, in, a, client, s, life, many, resources, available, to, a, person, experiencing, emotional, distress, the, friendly, support, of, friends, peers, family, members, clergy, contacts, personal, reading, healthy, exercise, research, and, independent, coping, all, present, considerable, value, critics, note, that, humans, have, been, dealing, with, crises, navigating, severe, social, problems, and, finding, solutions, to, life, problems, long, before, the, advent, of, psychotherapy, on, the, other, hand, some, argue, psychotherapy, is, under, utilized, and, under, researched, by, contemporary, psychiatry, despite, offering, more, promise, than, stagnant, medication, development, in, 2015, the, us, national, institute, of, mental, health, allocated, only, 5, 4, of, its, budget, to, new, clinical, trials, of, psychotherapies, medication, trials, are, largely, funded, by, pharmaceutical, companies, despite, plentiful, evidence, they, can, work, and, that, patients, are, more, likely, to, prefer, them, further, critiques, have, emerged, from, feminist, constructionist, and, discourse, analytical, sources, key, to, these, is, the, issue, of, power, in, this, regard, there, is, a, concern, that, clients, are, persuaded, both, inside, and, outside, the, consulting, room, to, understand, themselves, and, their, difficulties, in, ways, that, are, consistent, with, therapeutic, ideas, this, means, that, alternative, ideas, e, g, feminist, economic, spiritual, are, sometimes, implicitly, undermined, critics, suggest, that, we, idealize, the, situation, when, we, think, of, therapy, only, as, a, helping, relationship, arguing, instead, that, it, is, fundamentally, a, political, practice, in, that, some, cultural, ideas, and, practices, are, supported, while, others, are, undermined, or, disqualified, and, that, while, it, is, seldom, intended, the, therapist, client, relationship, always, participates, in, society, s, power, relations, and, political, dynamics, a, noted, academic, who, espoused, this, criticism, was, michel, foucault
