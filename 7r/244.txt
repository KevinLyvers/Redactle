traditionally, alaska, and, chukotsky, district, of, chukotka, autonomous, okrug, russia, inuit, languages, are, part, of, the, eskimo, aleut, languages, also, known, as, inuit, yupik, unangan, and, also, as, eskaleut, inuit, sign, language, is, a, critically, endangered, language, isolate, used, in, nunavut, canadian, inuit, live, throughout, most, of, northern, canada, in, the, territory, of, nunavut, nunavik, in, the, northern, third, of, quebec, the, nunatsiavut, in, labrador, and, in, various, parts, of, the, northwest, territories, and, yukon, traditionally, particularly, around, the, arctic, ocean, in, the, inuvialuit, settlement, region, these, areas, are, known, primarily, by, inuit, tapiriit, kanatami, as, inuit, nunangat, in, canada, sections, 25, and, 35, of, the, constitution, act, of, 1982, classify, inuit, as, a, distinctive, group, of, aboriginal, canadians, who, are, not, included, under, either, the, first, nations, or, the, m, tis, greenlandic, inuit, also, known, as, kalaallit, are, descendants, of, thule, migrations, from, canada, by, 1100, ce, although, greenland, withdrew, from, the, european, communities, in, 1985, inuit, of, greenland, are, danish, citizens, and, as, such, remain, citizens, of, the, european, union, in, the, united, states, the, alaskan, i, upiat, are, traditionally, located, in, the, northwest, arctic, borough, on, the, alaska, north, slope, the, bering, strait, and, on, little, diomede, island, in, russia, few, pockets, of, diaspora, communities, of, russian, i, upiat, from, big, diomede, island, of, which, inhabitants, were, removed, to, russian, mainland, remain, in, bering, strait, coast, of, chukotka, autonomous, okrug, particularly, in, uelen, lavrentiya, and, lorino, many, individuals, who, would, have, historically, been, referred, to, as, eskimo, find, that, term, offensive, or, forced, upon, them, in, a, colonial, way, inuit, is, now, a, common, autonym, for, a, large, sub, group, of, these, people, the, word, inuit, varying, forms, i, upiat, inuvialuit, inughuit, etc, however, is, an, ancient, self, referential, to, a, group, of, peoples, which, includes, at, most, the, i, upiat, of, bering, strait, coast, of, chukotka, and, northern, alaska, the, four, broad, groups, of, inuit, in, canada, and, the, greenlandic, inuit, this, usage, has, long, been, employed, to, the, exclusion, of, other, closely, related, groups, e, g, yupik, aleut, therefore, the, aleut, unangan, and, yupik, peoples, alutiiq, sugpiaq, central, yup, ik, siberian, yupik, who, live, in, alaska, and, siberia, at, least, at, an, individual, and, local, level, generally, do, not, self, identify, as, inuit, inuit, are, the, descendants, of, what, anthropologists, call, the, thule, people, who, emerged, from, the, bering, strait, and, western, alaska, around, 1000, ce, they, had, split, from, the, related, aleut, group, about, 4000, years, ago, and, from, northeastern, siberian, migrants, they, spread, eastward, across, the, arctic, they, displaced, the, related, dorset, culture, called, the, tuniit, in, inuktitut, which, was, the, last, major, paleo, eskimo, culture, inuit, legends, speak, of, the, tuniit, as, giants, people, who, were, taller, and, stronger, than, inuit, less, frequently, the, legends, refer, to, the, dorset, as, dwarfs, researchers, believe, that, inuit, society, had, advantages, by, having, adapted, to, using, dogs, as, transport, animals, and, developing, larger, weapons, and, other, technologies, superior, to, those, of, the, dorset, culture, by, 1100, ce, inuit, migrants, had, reached, west, greenland, where, they, settled, during, the, 12th, century, they, also, settled, in, east, greenland, faced, with, population, pressures, from, the, thule, and, other, surrounding, groups, such, as, the, algonquian, and, siouan, speaking, peoples, to, the, south, the, tuniit, gradually, receded, the, tuniit, were, thought, to, have, become, completely, extinct, as, a, people, by, about, 1400, or, 1500, but, in, the, mid, 1950s, researcher, henry, b, collins, determined, that, based, on, the, ruins, found, at, native, point, on, southampton, island, the, sadlermiut, were, likely, the, last, remnants, of, the, dorset, culture, or, tuniit, the, sadlermiut, population, survived, up, until, winter, 1902, 1903, when, exposure, to, new, infectious, diseases, brought, by, contact, with, europeans, led, to, their, extinction, as, a, people, in, the, early, 21st, century, mitochondrial, dna, research, has, supported, the, theory, of, continuity, between, the, tuniit, and, the, sadlermiut, peoples, it, also, provided, evidence, that, a, population, displacement, did, not, occur, within, the, aleutian, islands, between, the, dorset, and, thule, transition, however, a, subsequent, 2012, genetic, analysis, showed, no, genetic, link, between, the, sadlermiut, and, the, dorset, or, tuniit, people, in, contrast, to, other, tuniit, populations, the, aleut, and, sadlermiut, benefited, from, both, geographical, isolation, and, their, ability, to, adopt, certain, thule, technologies, in, canada, and, greenland, inuit, circulated, almost, exclusively, north, of, the, arctic, tree, line, with, the, exception, of, inuit, in, labrador, where, there, are, large, swaths, of, coastal, barrens, in, labrador, there, are, two, inuit, groups, one, accepted, by, inuit, tapiriit, kanatami, nunatsiavut, and, one, independent, nunatukavut, the, most, southern, inuit, community, in, nunatsiavut, is, rigolet, while, the, most, southern, community, within, the, traditional, inuit, territory, of, nunatukavut, and, in, the, world, is, l, anse, au, clair, labrador, in, other, areas, south, of, the, tree, line, non, inuit, indigenous, cultures, were, well, established, as, a, result, being, challenged, by, the, groups, below, the, tree, line, including, chukchi, and, siberian, yupik, for, russian, i, upiat, arctic, athabascan, and, gwich, in, for, alaskan, i, upiat, and, inuvialuit, cree, for, nunavummiut, nunavut, inuit, and, nunavimmiut, northern, quebec, inuit, and, innu, for, nunatsiavummiut, labrador, inuit, and,

cultures, boundary, disputes, were, common, and, gave, rise, to, aggressive, actions, warfare, was, not, uncommon, among, those, inuit, groups, with, sufficient, population, density, inuit, such, as, the, nunamiut, uummarmiut, who, inhabited, the, mackenzie, river, delta, area, often, engaged, in, warfare, the, more, sparsely, settled, inuit, in, the, central, arctic, however, did, so, less, often, their, first, european, contact, was, with, the, vikings, who, had, settled, in, greenland, centuries, prior, the, sagas, recorded, meeting, skr, lingar, probably, an, undifferentiated, label, for, all, the, indigenous, peoples, whom, the, norse, encountered, whether, tuniit, inuit, or, beothuk, after, about, 1350, the, climate, grew, colder, during, the, period, known, as, the, little, ice, age, during, this, period, russian, and, alaskan, natives, were, able, to, continue, their, whaling, activities, but, in, the, high, arctic, inuit, were, forced, to, abandon, their, hunting, and, whaling, sites, as, bowhead, whales, disappeared, from, canada, and, greenland, these, inuit, had, to, subsist, on, a, much, poorer, diet, and, lost, access, to, the, essential, raw, materials, for, their, tools, and, architecture, which, they, had, previously, derived, from, whaling, the, lives, of, paleo, eskimos, of, the, far, north, were, largely, unaffected, by, the, arrival, of, visiting, norsemen, except, for, mutual, trade, after, the, disappearance, of, the, norse, colonies, in, greenland, inuit, had, no, contact, with, europeans, for, at, least, a, century, by, the, mid, 16th, century, basque, whalers, and, fishermen, were, already, working, the, labrador, coast, and, had, established, whaling, stations, on, land, such, as, the, one, that, has, been, excavated, at, red, bay, labrador, inuit, do, not, appear, to, have, interfered, with, their, operations, but, raided, the, stations, in, winter, taking, tools, and, items, made, of, worked, iron, which, they, adapted, to, their, own, needs, martin, frobisher, s, 1576, search, for, the, northwest, passage, was, the, first, well, documented, contact, between, europeans, and, inuit, frobisher, s, expedition, landed, in, frobisher, bay, baffin, island, not, far, from, the, settlement, now, called, iqaluit, frobisher, encountered, inuit, on, resolution, island, where, five, sailors, left, the, ship, under, orders, from, frobisher, with, instructions, to, stay, clear, of, inuit, they, became, part, of, inuit, mythology, inuit, oral, tradition, tells, that, the, men, lived, among, them, for, a, few, years, of, their, own, free, will, until, they, died, attempting, to, leave, baffin, island, in, a, self, made, boat, and, vanished, frobisher, in, an, attempt, to, find, the, men, captured, three, inuit, and, brought, them, back, to, england, they, were, possibly, the, first, inuit, ever, to, visit, europe, the, semi, nomadic, inuit, were, fishermen, and, hunters, harvesting, lakes, seas, ice, platforms, and, tundra, while, there, are, some, allegations, that, inuit, were, hostile, to, early, french, and, english, explorers, fishermen, and, whalers, more, recent, research, suggests, that, the, early, relations, with, whaling, stations, along, the, labrador, coast, and, later, james, bay, were, based, on, a, mutual, interest, in, trade, in, the, final, years, of, the, 18th, century, the, moravian, church, began, missionary, activities, in, labrador, supported, by, the, british, who, were, tired, of, the, raids, on, their, whaling, stations, the, moravian, missionaries, could, easily, provide, inuit, with, the, iron, and, basic, materials, they, had, been, stealing, from, whaling, outposts, materials, whose, real, cost, to, europeans, was, almost, nothing, but, whose, value, to, inuit, was, enormous, from, then, on, contacts, between, the, national, groups, in, labrador, were, far, more, peaceful, the, exchanges, that, accompanied, the, arrival, and, colonization, by, the, europeans, greatly, damaged, inuit, way, of, life, mass, death, was, caused, by, the, new, infectious, diseases, carried, by, whalers, and, explorers, to, which, the, indigenous, peoples, had, no, acquired, immunity, the, high, mortality, rate, contributed, to, the, enormous, social, disruptions, caused, by, the, distorting, effect, of, europeans, material, wealth, and, the, introduction, of, different, materials, nonetheless, inuit, society, in, the, higher, latitudes, largely, remained, in, isolation, during, the, 19th, century, the, hudson, s, bay, company, opened, trading, posts, such, as, great, whale, river, 1820, today, the, site, of, the, twin, villages, of, whapmagoostui, cree, majority, and, kuujjuarapik, inuit, majority, where, whale, products, of, the, commercial, whale, hunt, were, processed, and, furs, traded, the, expedition, of, 1821, 23, to, the, northwest, passage, led, by, commander, william, edward, parry, twice, over, wintered, in, foxe, basin, it, provided, the, first, informed, sympathetic, and, well, documented, account, of, the, economic, social, and, religious, life, of, inuit, parry, stayed, in, what, is, now, igloolik, over, the, second, winter, parry, s, writings, with, pen, and, ink, illustrations, of, inuit, everyday, life, and, those, of, george, francis, lyon, were, widely, read, after, they, were, both, published, in, 1824, captain, george, comer, s, inuk, wife, shoofly, known, for, her, sewing, skills, and, elegant, attire, was, influential, in, convincing, him, to, acquire, more, sewing, accessories, and, beads, for, trade, with, inuit, during, the, early, 20th, century, a, few, traders, and, missionaries, circulated, among, the, more, accessible, bands, after, 1904, they, were, accompanied, by, a, handful, of, north, west, mounted, police, nwmp, unlike, most, aboriginal, peoples, in, canada, however, inuit, did, not, occupy, lands, that, were, coveted, by, european, settlers, used, to, more, temperate, climates, and, conditions, most, europeans, considered, the, homeland, of, inuit, to, be, hostile, hinterland, southerners, enjoyed, lucrative, careers, as, bureaucrats, and, service, providers, to, the, people, of, the, north, but, very, few, ever, chose, to, visit, there, once, its, more, hospitable, lands, were, largely, settled, the, government, of, canada, and, entrepreneurs, began, to, take, a, greater, interest, in, its, more, peripheral, territories, especially, the, fur, and, mineral, rich, hinterlands, by, the, late, 1920s, there, were, no, longer, any, inuit, who, had, not, been, contacted, by, traders, missionaries, or, government, agents, in, 1939, the, supreme, court, of, canada, found, in, a, decision, known, as, re, eskimos, that, inuit, should, be, considered, indians, and, were, thus, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, federal, government, native, customs, were, worn, down, by, the, actions, of, the, rcmp, who, enforced, canadian, criminal, law, on, inuit, people, such, as, kikkik, often, did, not, understand, the, rules, of, the, alien, society, with, which, they, had, to, interact, in, addition, the, generally, protestant, missionaries, of, the, british, preached, a, moral, code, very, different, from, the, one, inuit, had, as, part, of, their, tradition, many, inuit, were, systematically, converted, to, christianity, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, through, rituals, such, as, the, siqqitiq, world, war, ii, and, the, cold, war, made, arctic, canada, strategically, important, to, the, great, powers, for, the, first, time, thanks, to, the, development, of, modern, long, distance, aircraft, these, areas, became, accessible, year, round, the, construction, of, air, bases, and, the, distant, early, warning, line, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, brought, more, intensive, contact, with, european, society, particularly, in, the, form, of, public, education, for, children, the, traditionalists, complained, that, canadian, education, promoted, foreign, values, that, were, disdainful, of, the, traditional, structure, and, culture, of, inuit, society, in, the, 1950s, the, government, of, canada, undertook, what, was, called, the, high, arctic, relocation, for, several, reasons, these, were, to, include, protecting, canada, s, sovereignty, in, the, arctic, alleviating, hunger, as, the, area, currently, occupied, had, been, over, hunted, and, attempting, to, solve, the, eskimo, problem, by, seeking, assimilation, of, the, people, and, the, end, of, their, traditional, inuit, culture, one, of, the, more, notable, relocations, was, undertaken, in, 1953, when, 17, families, were, moved, from, port, harrison, now, inukjuak, quebec, to, resolute, and, grise, fiord, they, were, dropped, off, in, early, september, when, winter, had, already, arrived, the, land, they, were, sent, to, was, very, different, from, that, in, the, inukjuak, area, it, was, barren, with, only, a, couple, of, months, when, the, temperature, rose, above, freezing, and, several, months, of, polar, night, the, families, were, told, by, the, rcmp, they, would, be, able, to, return, to, their, home, territory, within, two, years, if, conditions, were, not, right, however, two, years, later, more, inuit, families, were, relocated, to, the, high, arctic, thirty, years, passed, before, they, were, able, to, visit, inukjuak, by, 1953, canada, s, prime, minister, louis, st, laurent, publicly, admitted, apparently, we, have, administered, the, vast, territories, of, the, north, in, an, almost, continuing, absence, of, mind, the, government, began, to, establish, about, forty, permanent, administrative, centers, to, provide, education, health, and, economic, development, services, inuit, from, hundreds, of, smaller, camps, scattered, across, the, north, began, to, congregate, in, these, hamlets, regular, visits, from, doctors, and, access, to, modern, medical, care, raised, the, birth, rate, and, decreased, the, death, rate, causing, a, marked, natural, increase, in, the, population, that, made, it, more, difficult, for, them, to, survive, by, traditional, means, in, the, 1950s, the, canadian, government, began, to, actively, settle, inuit, into, permanent, villages, and, cities, occasionally, against, their, will, such, as, in, nuntak, and, hebron, in, 2005, the, canadian, government, acknowledged, the, abuses, inherent, in, these, forced, resettlements, by, the, mid, 1960s, encouraged, first, by, missionaries, then, by, the, prospect, of, paid, jobs, and, government, services, and, finally, forced, by, hunger, and, required, by, the, police, most, canadian, inuit, lived, year, round, in, permanent, settlements, the, nomadic, migrations, that, were, the, central, feature, of, arctic, life, had, become, a, much, smaller, part, of, life, in, the, north, inuit, a, once, self, sufficient, people, in, an, extremely, harsh, environment, were, in, the, span, of, perhaps, two, generations, transformed, into, a, small, impoverished, minority, lacking, skills, or, resources, to, sell, to, the, larger, economy, but, increasingly, dependent, on, it, for, survival, although, anthropologists, like, diamond, jenness, 1964, were, quick, to, predict, that, inuit, culture, was, facing, extinction, inuit, political, activism, was, already, emerging, in, the, 1960s, the, canadian, government, funded, the, establishment, of, secular, government, operated, high, schools, in, the, northwest, territories, including, what, is, now, nunavut, and, inuit, areas, in, quebec, and, labrador, along, with, the, residential, school, system, inuit, population, was, not, large, enough, to, support, a, full, high, school, in, every, community, so, this, meant, only, a, few, schools, were, built, and, students, from, across, the, territories, were, boarded, there, these, schools, in, aklavik, iqaluit, yellowknife, inuvik, and, kuujjuaq, brought, together, young, inuit, from, across, the, arctic, in, one, place, for, the, first, time, and, exposed, them, to, the, rhetoric, of, civil, and, human, rights, that, prevailed, in, canada, in, the, 1960s, this, was, a, real, wake, up, call, for, inuit, and, it, stimulated, the, emergence, of, a, new, generation, of, young, inuit, activists, in, the, late, 1960s, who, came, forward, and, pushed, for, respect, for, inuit, and, their, territories, inuit, began, to, emerge, as, a, political, force, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, shortly, after, the, first, graduates, returned, home, they, formed, new, politically, active, associations, in, the, early, 1970s, starting, with, the, inuit, tapirisat, of, canada, inuit, brotherhood, and, today, known, as, inuit, tapiriit, kanatami, an, outgrowth, of, the, indian, and, eskimo, association, of, the, 60s, in, 1971, and, more, region, specific, organizations, shortly, afterward, including, the, committee, for, the, original, people, s, entitlement, representing, the, inuvialuit, the, northern, quebec, inuit, association, makivik, corporation, and, the, labrador, inuit, association, lia, representing, northern, labrador, inuit, since, the, mid, 1980s, the, disputed, southern, labrador, inuit, of, nunatukavut, began, organizing, politically, after, being, geographically, cut, out, of, the, lia, because, the, organization, called, itself, the, labrador, m, tis, nation, just, a, few, years, before, various, activist, movements, began, to, change, the, direction, of, inuit, society, in, 1975, with, the, james, bay, and, northern, quebec, agreement, this, comprehensive, land, claims, settlement, for, quebec, inuit, along, with, a, large, cash, settlement, and, substantial, administrative, autonomy, in, the, new, region, of, nunavik, set, the, precedent, for, the, settlements, to, follow, the, northern, labrador, inuit, submitted, their, land, claim, in, 1977, although, they, had, to, wait, until, 2005, to, have, a, signed, land, settlement, establishing, nunatsiavut, southern, labrador, inuit, of, nunatukavut, is, currently, in, the, process, of, establishing, land, claims, and, title, rights, that, would, allow, them, to, negotiate, with, the, newfoundland, government, canada, s, 1982, constitution, act, recognized, inuit, as, aboriginal, peoples, in, canada, in, the, same, year, the, tunngavik, federation, of, nunavut, tfn, was, incorporated, in, order, to, take, over, negotiations, for, land, claims, on, behalf, of, inuit, living, in, the, eastern, northwest, territories, that, would, later, become, nunavut, from, inuit, tapiriit, kanatami, which, became, a, joint, association, of, inuit, of, quebec, labrador, and, the, northwest, territories, on, october, 30, 2008, leona, aglukkaq, was, appointed, as, minister, of, health, the, first, inuk, to, hold, a, senior, cabinet, position, although, she, is, not, the, first, inuk, to, be, in, cabinet, altogether, jack, anawak, and, nancy, karetak, lindell, were, both, parliamentary, secretaries, respectively, from, 1993, to, 1996, and, in, 2003, the, term, eskimo, is, still, used, by, people, however, in, the, 21st, century, usage, in, north, america, has, declined, in, the, united, states, the, term, eskimo, was, as, of, 2016, commonly, used, to, describe, inuit, and, the, siberian, and, alaskan, yupik, and, i, upiat, peoples, eskimo, is, still, used, by, some, groups, and, organizations, to, encompass, inuit, and, yupik, as, well, as, other, indigenous, alaskan, and, siberian, peoples, in, 2011, lawrence, kaplan, of, the, alaska, native, language, center, at, the, university, of, alaska, fairbanks, wrote, that, inuit, was, not, generally, accepted, as, a, term, for, the, yupik, and, eskimo, was, often, used, as, the, term, that, applied, to, the, yupik, i, upiat, and, inuit, since, then, kaplan, has, updated, this, to, indicate, that, the, term, inuit, has, gained, acceptance, in, alaska, though, there, is, much, debate, the, word, eskimo, likely, derives, from, a, innu, aimun, montagnais, exonym, meaning, a, person, who, laces, a, snowshoe, but, is, also, used, in, folk, etymology, as, meaning, eater, of, raw, meat, in, the, cree, language, though, the, cree, etymology, has, been, discredited, eskimo, is, considered, pejorative, by, some, canadian, and, english, speaking, greenlandic, inuit, in, canada, and, greenland, inuit, is, preferred, inuit, is, the, eastern, canadian, inuit, inuktitut, and, west, greenlandic, kalaallisut, word, for, the, people, since, inuktitut, and, kalaallisut, are, the, prestige, dialects, in, canada, and, greenland, respectively, their, version, has, become, dominant, although, every, inuit, dialect, uses, cognates, from, the, proto, eskimo, i, u, for, example, people, is, inughuit, in, north, greenlandic, and, iivit, in, east, greenlandic, inuit, speak, inupiaq, inupiatun, inuinnaqtun, inuktitut, inuvialuktun, and, greenlandic, languages, which, belong, to, the, inuit, inupiaq, branch, of, the, inuit, yupik, unangan, language, family, inupiaq, inupiatun, is, spoken, in, russia, extinct, and, alaska, which, is, one, of, the, 22, official, languages, of, the, state, of, alaska, in, russia, due, to, the, replacement, from, their, traditional, territory, in, big, diomede, island, to, mainland, russia, inupiaq, language, has, been, nearly, extinct, with, most, of, them, speaking, central, siberian, yupik, or, russian, predominantly, with, some, inupiaq, linguistic, features, in, canada, three, inuit, languages, inuvialuktun, inuinnaqtun, inuktitut, are, spoken, inuvialuktun, is, spoken, in, the, inuvialuit, settlement, region, northwest, territories, with, official, language, status, from, the, territorial, government, inuinnaqtun, is, spoken, across, the, northwest, territories, and, the, kitikmeot, region, of, nunavut, with, official, language, status, from, both, territories, inuktitut, the, most, widely, spoken, inuit, language, in, canada, however, is, an, official, and, one, of, two, main, languages, alongside, english, of, nunavut, and, has, its, speakers, throughout, nunavut, nunavik, northern, quebec, nunatsiavut, labrador, and, the, northwest, territories, where, it, is,

language, isolate, and, is, almost, extinct, as, only, around, 50, people, still, use, it, inuit, have, traditionally, been, fishermen, and, hunters, they, still, hunt, whales, esp, bowhead, whale, seal, esp, ringed, seal, harp, seal, common, seal, bearded, seal, polar, bears, muskoxen, caribou, birds, and, fish, and, at, times, other, less, commonly, eaten, animals, such, as, the, arctic, fox, the, typical, inuit, diet, is, high, in, protein, and, very, high, in, fat, in, their, traditional, diets, inuit, consumed, an, average, of, 75, per, cent, of, their, daily, energy, intake, from, fat, while, it, is, not, possible, to, cultivate, plants, for, food, in, the, arctic, inuit, have, traditionally, gathered, those, that, are, naturally, available, grasses, tubers, roots, plant, stems, berries, and, seaweed, kuanniq, or, edible, seaweed, were, collected, and, preserved, depending, on, the, season, and, the, location, there, is, a, vast, array, of, different, hunting, technologies, that, inuit, used, to, gather, their, food, in, the, 1920s, anthropologist, vilhjalmur, stefansson, lived, with, and, studied, a, group, of, inuit, the, study, focused, on, stefansson, s, observation, that, inuit, s, low, carbohydrate, diet, apparently, had, no, adverse, effects, on, their, health, nor, indeed, on, his, own, health, stefansson, 1946, also, observed, that, inuit, were, able, to, get, the, necessary, vitamins, they, needed, from, their, traditional, winter, diet, which, did, not, contain, any, plant, matter, in, particular, he, found, that, adequate, vitamin, c, could, be, obtained, from, items, in, their, traditional, diet, of, raw, meat, such, as, ringed, seal, liver, and, whale, skin, muktuk, while, there, was, considerable, skepticism, when, he, reported, these, findings, the, initial, anecdotal, reports, were, reaffirmed, both, in, the, 1970s, and, more, recently, modern, inuit, have, lifespans, 12, to, 15, years, shorter, than, the, average, canadian, s, which, is, thought, to, be, influenced, by, factors, such, as, their, diet, and, limited, access, to, medical, services, the, life, expectancy, gap, is, not, closing, and, remains, stagnant, the, ancient, art, of, face, tattooing, among, inuit, women, which, is, called, kakiniit, or, tunniit, in, inuktitut, dates, back, nearly, 4, 000, years, the, facial, tattoos, detailed, aspects, of, the, women, s, lives, such, as, where, they, were, from, who, their, family, was, their, life, achievements, and, their, position, in, the, community, when, catholic, missionaries, arrived, in, the, area, in, the, early, 20th, century, they, outlawed, the, practice, but, it, is, now, making, a, comeback, thanks, to, some, modern, inuit, women, who, want, to, revive, the, practices, of, their, ancestors, and, get, in, touch, with, their, cultural, roots, the, traditional, method, of, tattooing, was, done, with, needles, made, of, sinew, or, bone, soaked, in, suet, and, sewn, into, the, skin, but, today, they, use, ink, the, inuit, tattoo, revitalization, project, is, a, community, that, was, created, to, highlight, the, revitalization, of, this, ancient, tradition, inuit, hunted, sea, animals, from, single, passenger, seal, skin, covered, boats, called, qajaq, inuktitut, syllabics, which, were, extraordinarily, buoyant, and, could, be, righted, by, a, seated, person, even, if, completely, overturned, because, of, this, property, the, design, was, copied, by, europeans, and, americans, who, still, produce, them, under, inuit, name, kayak, inuit, also, made, umiaq, woman, s, boat, larger, open, boats, made, of, wood, frames, covered, with, animal, skins, for, transporting, people, goods, and, dogs, they, were, 6, 12, m, 20, 39, ft, long, and, had, a, flat, bottom, so, that, the, boats, could, come, close, to, shore, in, the, winter, inuit, would, also, hunt, sea, mammals, by, patiently, watching, an, aglu, breathing, hole, in, the, ice, and, waiting, for, the, air, breathing, seals, to, use, them, this, technique, is, also, used, by, the, polar, bear, who, hunts, by, seeking, holes, in, the, ice, and, waiting, nearby, in, winter, both, on, land, and, on, sea, ice, inuit, used, dog, sleds, qamutik, for, transportation, the, husky, dog, breed, comes, from, the, siberian, husky, these, dogs, were, bred, from, wolves, for, transportation, a, team, of, dogs, in, either, a, tandem, side, by, side, or, fan, formation, would, pull, a, sled, made, of, wood, animal, bones, or, the, baleen, from, a, whale, s, mouth, and, even, frozen, fish, over, the, snow, and, ice, inuit, used, stars, to, navigate, at, sea, and, landmarks, to, navigate, on, land, they, possessed, a, comprehensive, native, system, of, toponymy, where, natural, landmarks, were, insufficient, inuit, would, erect, an, inukshuk, also, greenland, inuit, created, ammassalik, wooden, maps, which, are, tactile, devices, that, represent, the, coastline, dogs, played, an, integral, role, in, the, annual, routine, of, inuit, during, the, summer, they, became, pack, animals, sometimes, dragging, up, to, 20, kg, 44, lb, of, baggage, and, in, the, winter, they, pulled, the, sled, yearlong, they, assisted, with, hunting, by, sniffing, out, seals, holes, and, pestering, polar, bears, they, also, protected, inuit, villages, by, barking, at, bears, and, strangers, inuit, generally, favoured, and, tried, to, breed, the, most, striking, and, handsome, of, dogs, especially, ones, with, bright, eyes, and, healthy, coats, common, husky, dog, breeds, used, by, inuit, were,

exclusively, on, animal, hides, driftwood, and, bones, although, some, tools, were, also, made, out, of, worked, stones, particularly, the, readily, worked, soapstone, walrus, ivory, was, a, particularly, essential, material, used, to, make, knives, art, played, a, big, part, in, inuit, society, and, continues, to, do, so, today, small, sculptures, of, animals, and, human, figures, usually, depicting, everyday, activities, such, as, hunting, and, whaling, were, carved, from, ivory, and, bone, in, modern, times, prints, and, figurative, works, carved, in, relatively, soft, stone, such, as, soapstone, serpentinite, or, argillite, have, also, become, popular, traditional, inuit, clothing, and, footwear, is, made, from, animal, skins, sewn, together, using, needles, made, from, animal, bones, and, threads, made, from, other, animal, products, such, as, sinew, the, anorak, parka, is, made, in, a, similar, fashion, by, arctic, peoples, from, europe, through, asia, and, the, americas, including, inuit, the, back, part, of, an, amauti, women, s, parka, was, traditionally, made, extra, large, with, a, separate, compartment, below, the, hood, to, allow, the, mother, to, carry, a, baby, against, her, back, and, protect, it, from, the, harsh, wind, styles, vary, from, region, to, region, from, the, shape, of, the, hood, to, the, length, of, the, tails, boots, mukluk, or, kamik, could, be, made, of, caribou, or, seal, skin, and, designed, for, men, and, women, during, the, winter, certain, inuit, lived, in, a, temporary, shelter, made, from, snow, called, an, igloo, and, during, the, few, months, of, the, year, when, temperatures, were, above, freezing, they, lived, in, tents, known, as, tupiq, made, of, animal, skins, supported, by, a, frame, of, bones, or, wood, some, such, as, the, siglit, used, driftwood, while, others, built, sod, houses, inuit, also, used, the, cape, york, meteorite, as, a, primary, resource, of, iron, using, a, technique, called, cold, forging, which, consisted, in, slicing, a, piece, of, the, meteorite, and, giving, it, shape, by, smashing, it, with, rocks, until, getting, the, desired, shape, for, example, tools, for, fishing, they, used, this, meteorite, for, centuries, until, robert, e, peary, sold, it, to, the, american, natural, history, museum, in, 1883, the, division, of, labor, in, traditional, inuit, society, had, a, strong, gender, component, but, it, was, not, absolute, the, men, were, traditionally, hunters, and, fishermen, and, the, women, took, care, of, the, children, cleaned, the, home, sewed, processed, food, and, cooked, however, there, are, numerous, examples, of, women, who, hunted, out, of, necessity, or, as, a, personal, choice, at, the, same, time, men, who, could, be, away, from, camp, for, several, days, at, a, time, would, be, expected, to, know, how, to, sew, and, cook, the, marital, customs, among, inuit, were, not, strictly, monogamous, many, inuit, relationships, were, implicitly, or, explicitly, sexual, open, marriages, polygamy, divorce, and, remarriage, were, known, among, some, inuit, groups, if, there, were, children, divorce, required, the, approval, of, the, community, and, particularly, the, agreement, of, the, elders, marriages, were, often, arranged, sometimes, in, infancy, and, occasionally, forced, on, the, couple, by, the, community, marriage, was, common, for, women, at, puberty, and, for, men, when, they, became, productive, hunters, family, structure, was, flexible, a, household, might, consist, of, a, husband, and, wife, or, wives, and, children, it, might, include, his, parents, or, his, wife, s, parents, as, well, as, adopted, children, it, might, be, a, larger, formation, of, several, siblings, with, their, parents, wives, and, children, or, even, more, than, one, family, sharing, dwellings, and, resources, every, household, had, its, head, either, an, elder, or, a, particularly, respected, man, there, was, also, a, larger, notion, of, community, as, generally, several, families, shared, a, place, where, they, wintered, goods, were, shared, within, a, household, and, also, to, a, significant, extent, within, a, whole, community, inuit, were, hunter, gatherers, and, have, been, referred, to, as, nomadic, one, of, the, customs, following, the, birth, of, an, infant, was, for, an, angakkuq, shaman, to, place, a, tiny, ivory, carving, of, a, whale, into, the, baby, s, mouth, in, hopes, this, would, make, the, child, good, at, hunting, loud, singing, and, drumming, were, also, customary, at, birth, virtually, all, inuit, cultures, have, oral, traditions, of, raids, by, other, indigenous, peoples, including, fellow, inuit, and, of, taking, vengeance, on, them, in, return, such, as, the, bloody, falls, massacre, western, observers, often, regarded, these, tales, as, generally, not, entirely, accurate, historical, accounts, but, more, as, self, serving, myths, however, evidence, shows, that, inuit, cultures, had, quite, accurate, methods, of, teaching, historical, accounts, to, each, new, generation, in, northern, canada, historically, there, were, ethnic, feuds, between, the, dene, and, inuit, as, witnessed, by, samuel, hearne, in, 1771, in, 1996, dene, and, inuit, representatives, participated, in, a, healing, ceremony, to, reconcile, the, centuries, old, grievances, the, historic, accounts, of, violence, against, outsiders, make, it, clear, that, there, was, a, history, of, hostile, contact, within, inuit, cultures, and, with, other, cultures, it, also, makes, it, clear, that, inuit, nations, existed, through, history, as, well, as, confederations, of, such, nations, the, known, confederations, were, usually, formed, to, defend, against, a, more, prosperous, and, thus, stronger, nation, alternately, people, who, lived, in, less, productive, geographical, areas, tended, to, be, less, warlike, as, they, had, to, spend, more, time, producing, food, justice, within, inuit, culture, was, moderated, by, the, form, of, governance, that, gave, significant, power, to, the, elders, as, in, most, cultures, around, the, world, justice, could, be, harsh, and, often, included, capital, punishment, for, serious, crimes, against, the, community, or, the, individual, during, raids, against, other, peoples, inuit, like, their, non, inuit, neighbors, tended, to, be, merciless, a, pervasive, european, myth, about, inuit, is, that, they, killed, elderly, senicide, and, unproductive, people, but, this, is, not, generally, true, in, a, culture, with, an, oral, history, elders, are, the, keepers, of, communal, knowledge, effectively, the, community, library, because, they, are, of, extreme, value, as, the, repository, of, knowledge, there, are, cultural, taboos, against, sacrificing, elders, in, antoon, a, leenaars, book, suicide, in, canada, he, states, that, rasmussen, found, that, the, death, of, elders, by, suicide, was, a, commonplace, among, the, iglulik, inuit, according, to, franz, boas, suicide, was, not, of, rare, occurrence, and, was, generally, accomplished, through, hanging, writing, of, the, labrador, inuit, hawkes, 1916, was, considerably, more, explicit, on, the, subject, of, suicide, and, the, burden, of, the, elderly, aged, people, who, have, outlived, their, usefulness, and, whose, life, is, a, burden, both, to, themselves, and, their, relatives, are, put, to, death, by, stabbing, or, strangulation, this, is, customarily, done, at, the, request, of, the, individual, concerned, but, not, always, so, aged, people, who, are, a, hindrance, on, the, trail, are, abandoned, when, food, is, not, sufficient, the, elderly, are, the, least, likely, to, survive, in, the, extreme, case, of, famine, inuit, fully, understood, that, if, there, was, to, be, any, hope, of, obtaining, more, food, a, hunter, was, necessarily, the, one, to, feed, on, whatever, food, was, left, however, a, common, response, to, desperate, conditions, and, the, threat, of, starvation, was, infanticide, a, mother, abandoned, an, infant, in, hopes, that, someone, less, desperate, might, find, and, adopt, the, child, before, the, cold, or, animals, killed, it, the, belief, that, inuit, regularly, resorted, to, infanticide, may, be, due, in, part, to, studies, done, by, asen, balikci, milton, freeman, and, david, riches, among, the, netsilik, along, with, the, trial, of, kikkik, other, recent, research, has, noted, that, while, there, is, little, disagreement, that, there, were, examples, of, infanticide, in, inuit, communities, it, is, presently, not, known, the, depth, and, breadth, of, these, incidents, the, research, is, neither, complete, nor, conclusive, to, allow, for, a, determination, of, whether, infanticide, was, a, rare, or, a, widely, practiced, event, there, is, no, agreement, about, the, actual, estimates, of, the, frequency, of, newborn, female, infanticide, in, inuit, population, carmel, schrire, mentions, diverse, studies, ranging, from, 15, to, 80, percent, anthropologists, believed, that, inuit, cultures, routinely, killed, children, born, with, physical, defects, because, of, the, demands, of, the, extreme, climate, these, views, were, changed, by, late, 20th, century, discoveries, of, burials, at, an, archaeological, site, between, 1982, and, 1994, a, storm, with, high, winds, caused, ocean, waves, to, erode, part, of, the, bluffs, near, utqia, vik, alaska, and, a, body, was, discovered, to, have, been, washed, out, of, the, mud, unfortunately, the, storm, claimed, the, body, which, was, not, recovered, but, examination, of, the, eroded, bank, indicated, that, an, ancient, house, perhaps, with, other, remains, was, likely, to, be, claimed, by, the, next, storm, the, site, known, as, the, ukkuqsi, archaeological, site, was, excavated, several, frozen, bodies, now, known, as, the, frozen, family, were, recovered, autopsies, were, performed, and, they, were, re, interred, as, the, first, burials, in, the, then, new, imaiqsaun, cemetery, south, of, barrow, years, later, another, body, was, washed, out, of, the, bluff, it, was, a, female, child, approximately, nine, years, old, who, had, clearly, been, born, with, a, congenital, birth, defect, this, child, had, never, been, able, to, walk, but, must, have, been, cared, for, by, family, throughout, her, life, she, was, the, best, preserved, body, ever, recovered, in, alaska, and, radiocarbon, dating, of, grave, goods, and, of, a, strand, of, her, hair, all, place, her, back, to, about, 1200, ce, during, the, 19th, century, the, western, arctic, suffered, a, population, decline, of, close, to, 90, per, cent, resulting, from, exposure, to, new, diseases, including, tuberculosis, measles, influenza, and, smallpox, autopsies, near, greenland, reveal, that, more, commonly, pneumonia, kidney, diseases, trichinosis, malnutrition, and, degenerative, disorders, may, have, contributed, to, mass, deaths, among, different, inuit, tribes, inuit, believed, that, the, causes, of, the, disease, were, of, a, spiritual, origin, canadian, churches, and, eventually, the, federal, government, ran, the, earliest, health, facilities, for, inuit, population, whether, fully, segregated, hospitals, or, annexes, and, wards, attached, to, settler, hospitals, these, indian, hospitals, were, focused, on, treating, people, for, tuberculosis, though, diagnosis, was, difficult, and, treatment, involved, forced, removal, of, individuals, from, their, communities, for, in, patient, confinement, in, other, parts, of, the, country, dr, kevin, patterson, a, physician, wrote, an, op, ed, in, the, globe, and, mail, in, october, 2017, the, federal, minister, of, indigenous, services, jane, philpott, announced, that, in, 2015, tuberculosis, was, 270, times, more, common, among, the, canadian, inuit, than, it, is, among, non, indigenous, southern, canadians, the, canadian, medical, association, journal, published, in, 2013, that, tuberculosis, among, canadian, inuit, has, dramatically, increased, since, 1997, in, 2010, the, incidence, in, nunavut, was, 304, per, 100, 000, more, than, 66, times, the, rate, seen, in, the, general, population, inuit, qaujimajatuqangit, or, inuit, traditional, laws, are, anthropologically, different, from, western, law, concepts, customary, law, was, thought, non, existent, in, inuit, society, before, the, introduction, of, the, canadian, legal, system, in, 1954, e, adamson, hoebel, concluded, that, only, rudimentary, law, existed, amongst, inuit, no, known, western, observer, before, 1970, was, aware, that, any, form, of, governance, existed, among, any, inuit, however, there, was, a, set, way, of, doing, things, that, had, to, be, followed, if, an, individual, s, actions, went, against, the, tirigusuusiit, maligait, or, piqujait, the, angakkuq, shaman, might, have, to, intervene, lest, the, consequences, be, dire, to, the, individual, or, the, community, we, are, told, today, that, inuit, never, had, laws, or, maligait, why, they, say, because, they, are, not, written, on, paper, when, i, think, of, paper, i, think, you, can, tear, it, up, and, the, laws, are, gone, the, laws, of, the, inuit, are, not, on, paper, the, environment, in, which, inuit, lived, inspired, a, mythology, filled, with, adventure, tales, of, whale, and, walrus, hunts, long, winter, months, of, waiting, for, caribou, herds, or, sitting, near, breathing, holes, hunting, seals, gave, birth, to, stories, of, the, mysterious, and, sudden, appearance, of, ghosts, and, fantastic, creatures, some, inuit, looked, into, the, aurora, borealis, or, northern, lights, to, find, images, of, their, family, and, friends, dancing, in, the, next, life, however, some, inuit, believed, that, the, lights, were, more, sinister, and, if, you, whistled, at, them, they, would, come, down, and, cut, off, your, head, this, tale, is, still, told, to, children, today, for, others, they, were, invisible, giants, the, souls, of, animals, a, guide, to, hunting, and, as, a, spirit, for, the, angakkuq, to, help, with, healing, they, relied, upon, the, angakkuq, shaman, for, spiritual, interpretation, the, nearest, thing, to, a, central, deity, was, the, old, woman, sedna, who, lived, beneath, the, sea, the, waters, a, central, food, source, were, believed, to, contain, great, gods, inuit, practiced, a, form, of, shamanism, based, on, animist, principles, they, believed, that, all, things, had, a, form, of, spirit, including, humans, and, that, to, some, extent, these, spirits, could, be, influenced, by, a, pantheon, of, supernatural, entities, that, could, be, appeased, when, one, required, some, animal, or, inanimate, thing, to, act, in, a, certain, way, the, angakkuq, of, a, community, of, inuit, was, not, the, leader, but, rather, a, sort, of, healer, and, psychotherapist, who, tended, wounds, and, offered, advice, as, well, as, invoking, the, spirits, to, assist, people, in, their, lives, their, role, was, to, see, interpret, and, exhort, the, subtle, and, unseen, angakkuit, were, not, trained, they, were, held, to, be, born, with, the, ability, and, recognized, by, the, community, as, they, approached, adulthood, inuit, religion, was, closely, tied, to, a, system, of, rituals, integrated, into, the, daily, life, of, the, people, these, rituals, were, simple, but, held, to, be, necessary, according, to, a, customary, inuit, saying, the, great, peril, of, our, existence, lies, in, the, fact, that, our, diet, consists, entirely, of, souls, by, believing, that, all, things, including, animals, have, souls, like, those, of, humans, any, hunt, that, failed, to, show, appropriate, respect, and, customary, supplication, would, only, give, the, liberated, spirits, cause, to, avenge, themselves, the, harshness, and, unpredictability, of, life, in, the, arctic, ensured, that, inuit, lived, with, concern, for, the, uncontrollable, where, a, streak, of, bad, luck, could, destroy, an, entire, community, to, offend, a, spirit, was, to, risk, its, interference, with, an, already, marginal, existence, inuit, understood, that, they, had, to, work, in, harmony, with, supernatural, powers, to, provide, the, necessities, of, day, to, day, life, in, total, there, are, about, 148, 000, inuit, living, in, four, countries, canada, greenland, denmark, and, the, united, states, as, of, the, 2016, canadian, census, there, were, 65, 025, people, identifying, as, inuit, living, in, canada, this, was, up, 29, 1, per, cent, from, the, 2006, canadian, census, close, to, three, quarters, 72, 8, per, cent, of, inuit, lived, in, one, of, the, four, regions, comprising, inuit, nunangat, nunavut, nunavik,
