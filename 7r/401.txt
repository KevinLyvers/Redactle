dutch, endonym, nederlands, is, a, west, germanic, language, spoken, by, about, 25, million, people, as, a, first, language, and, 5, million, as, a, second, language, and, is, the, third, most, spoken, germanic, language, in, europe, dutch, is, the, native, language, of, most, of, the, population, of, the, netherlands, and, flanders, and, 60, of, the, population, of, belgium, dutch, was, one, of, the, official, languages, of, south, africa, until, 1925, when, it, was, replaced, by, afrikaans, a, separate, but, partially, mutually, intelligible, daughter, language, of, dutch, afrikaans, depending, on, the, definition, used, may, be, considered, a, sister, language, spoken, to, some, degree, by, at, least, 16, million, people, mainly, in, south, africa, and, namibia, and, evolving, from, cape, dutch, dialects, in, south, america, it, is, the, native, language, of, the, majority, of, the, population, of, suriname, and, spoken, as, a, second, language, in, the, polyglot, caribbean, island, countries, of, aruba, cura, ao, and, sint, maarten, all, these, countries, have, recognised, dutch, as, one, of, their, official, languages, and, are, involved, in, one, way, or, another, in, the, dutch, language, union, the, dutch, caribbean, municipalities, st, eustatius, saba, and, bonaire, have, dutch, as, one, of, the, official, languages, in, asia, dutch, was, used, in, the, dutch, east, indies, now, mostly, indonesia, by, a, limited, educated, elite, of, around, 2, of, the, total, population, including, over, 1, million, indigenous, indonesians, until, it, was, banned, in, 1957, but, the, ban, was, lifted, afterwards, about, a, fifth, of, the, indonesian, language, can, be, traced, to, dutch, including, many, loan, words, indonesia, s, civil, code, has, not, been, officially, translated, and, the, original, dutch, language, version, dating, from, colonial, times, remains, the, authoritative, version, up, to, half, a, million, native, speakers, reside, in, the, united, states, canada, and, australia, combined, and, historical, linguistic, minorities, on, the, verge, of, extinction, remain, in, parts, of, france, and, germany, dutch, is, one, of, the, closest, relatives, of, both, german, and, english, and, is, colloquially, said, to, be, roughly, in, between, them, dutch, like, english, has, not, undergone, the, high, german, consonant, shift, does, not, use, germanic, umlaut, as, a, grammatical, marker, has, largely, abandoned, the, use, of, the, subjunctive, and, has, levelled, much, of, its, morphology, including, most, of, its, case, system, features, shared, with, german, however, include, the, survival, of, two, to, three, grammatical, genders, albeit, with, few, grammatical, consequences, as, well, as, the, use, of, modal, particles, final, obstruent, devoicing, and, similar, word, order, dutch, vocabulary, is, mostly, germanic, it, incorporates, slightly, more, romance, loans, than, german, but, far, fewer, than, english, in, belgium, the, netherlands, and, suriname, the, native, official, name, for, dutch, is, nederlands, historically, nederlandsch, before, the, dutch, orthographic, reforms, sometimes, vlaams, flemish, is, used, as, well, to, describe, standard, dutch, in, flanders, whereas, hollands, hollandic, is, occasionally, used, as, a, colloquial, term, for, the, standard, language, in, the, central, and, northwestern, parts, of, the, netherlands, english, uses, the, adjective, dutch, as, a, noun, for, the, language, of, the, netherlands, and, flanders, the, word, is, derived, from, proto, germanic, iudiskaz, the, stem, of, this, word, eud, meant, people, in, proto, germanic, and, iskaz, was, an, adjective, forming, suffix, of, which, ish, is, the, modern, english, form, theodiscus, was, its, latinised, form, and, used, as, an, adjective, referring, to, the, germanic, vernaculars, of, the, early, middle, ages, in, this, sense, it, meant, the, language, of, the, common, people, the, term, was, used, as, opposed, to, latin, the, non, native, language, of, writing, and, the, catholic, church, it, was, first, recorded, in, 786, when, the, bishop, of, ostia, writes, to, pope, adrian, i, about, a, synod, taking, place, in, corbridge, england, where, the, decisions, are, being, written, down, tam, latine, quam, theodisce, meaning, in, latin, as, well, as, common, vernacular, according, to, a, hypothesis, by, de, grauwe, in, northern, west, francia, i, e, modern, day, belgium, the, term, would, take, on, a, new, meaning, during, the, early, middle, ages, when, within, the, context, of, a, highly, dichromatic, linguistic, landscape, it, came, to, be, the, antonym, of, walhisk, romance, speakers, specifically, old, french, the, word, now, rendered, as, dietsc, southwestern, variant, or, duutsc, central, and, northern, variant, could, refer, to, the, dutch, language, itself, as, well, as, a, broader, germanic, category, depending, on, context, during, the, high, middle, ages, dietsc, duutsc, was, increasingly, used, as, an, umbrella, term, for, the, specific, germanic, dialects, spoken, in, the, low, countries, its, meaning, being, largely, implicitly, provided, by, the, regional, orientation, of, medieval, dutch, society, apart, from, the, higher, echelons, of, the, clergy, and, nobility, mobility, was, largely, static, and, hence, while, dutch, could, by, extension, also, be, used, in, its, earlier, sense, referring, to, what, to, today, would, be, called, germanic, dialects, as, opposed, to, romance, dialects, in, many, cases, it, was, understood, or, meant, to, refer, to, the, language, now, known, as, dutch, in, the, low, countries, dietsch, or, its, early, modern, dutch, form, duytsch, as, an, endonym, for, dutch, gradually, went, out, of, common, use, and, was, gradually, replaced, by, the, dutch, endonym, nederlands, this, designation, first, attested, in, 1482, started, at, the, burgundian, court, in, the, 15th, century, although, the, use, of, neder, laag, bas, and, inferior, nether, or, low, to, refer, to, the, area, known, as, the, low, countries, goes, back, further, in, time, with, the, romans, referring, to, the, region, as, germania, inferior, lower, germania, it, is, a, reference, to, the, low, countries, downriver, location, at, the, rhine, meuse, scheldt, delta, near, the, north, sea, from, 1551, the, designation, nederlands, received, strong, competition, from, the, name, nederduytsch, literally, low, dutch, dutch, being, used, in, its, archaic, sense, covering, all, continental, west, germanic, languages, it, is, a, calque, of, the, aforementioned, roman, province, germania, inferior, and, an, attempt, by, early, dutch, grammarians, to, give, their, language, more, prestige, by, linking, it, to, roman, times, likewise, hoogduits, high, german, and, overlands, upper, landish, came, into, use, as, a, dutch, exonym, for, the, various, german, dialects, used, in, neighboring, german, states, use, of, nederduytsch, was, popular, in, the, 16th, century, but, ultimately, lost, out, over, nederlands, during, the, close, of, the, 18th, century, with, hoog, duytsch, establishing, itself, as, the, dutch, exonym, for, german, during, this, same, period, in, the, 19th, century, germany, saw, the, rise, of, the, categorisation, of, dialects, with, german, dialectologists, terming, the, german, dialects, spoken, in, the, mountainous, south, of, germany, as, hochdeutsch, high, german, subsequently, german, dialects, spoken, in, the, north, were, designated, as, niederdeutsch, low, german, the, names, for, these, dialects, were, calqued, by, dutch, linguists, as, nederduits, and, hoogduits, as, a, result, nederduits, no, longer, serves, as, a, synonym, for, the, dutch, language, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, diets, was, revived, by, dutch, linguists, and, historians, as, well, as, a, poetic, name, for, middle, dutch, and, its, literature, old, dutch, can, be, discerned, more, or, less, around, the, same, time, as, old, english, anglo, saxon, old, high, german, old, frisian, and, old, saxon, these, names, are, derived, from, the, modern, standard, languages, in, this, age, no, standard, languages, had, yet, developed, while, a, perfect, west, germanic, dialect, continuum, remained, present, the, division, reflects, the, contingent, future, contribution, dialect, groups, would, have, to, the, later, languages, the, early, form, of, dutch, was, a, set, of, franconian, dialects, spoken, by, the, salian, franks, in, the, 5th, century, these, happened, to, develop, through, middle, dutch, to, modern, dutch, over, the, course, of, fifteen, centuries, during, that, period, they, forced, old, frisian, back, from, the, western, coast, to, the, north, of, the, low, countries, and, influenced, or, even, replaced, old, saxon, spoken, in, the, east, contiguous, with, the, low, german, area, on, the, other, hand, dutch, has, been, replaced, in, adjacent, lands, in, present, day, france, and, germany, the, division, into, old, middle, and, modern, dutch, is, mostly, conventional, since, the, transition, between, them, was, very, gradual, one, of, the, few, moments, when, linguists, can, detect, something, of, a, revolution, is, when, the, dutch, standard, language, emerged, and, quickly, established, itself, the, development, of, the, dutch, language, is, illustrated, by, the, following, sentence, in, old, middle, and, modern, dutch, among, the, indo, european, languages, dutch, is, grouped, within, the, germanic, languages, meaning, it, shares, a, common, ancestor, with, languages, such, as, english, german, and, the, scandinavian, languages, all, germanic, languages, are, subject, to, the, grimm, s, law, and, verner, s, law, sound, shifts, which, originated, in, the, proto, germanic, language, and, define, the, basic, features, differentiating, them, from, other, indo, european, languages, this, is, assumed, to, have, taken, place, in, approximately, the, mid, first, millennium, bce, in, the, pre, roman, northern, european, iron, age, the, germanic, languages, are, traditionally, divided, into, three, groups, east, now, extinct, west, and, north, germanic, they, remained, mutually, intelligible, throughout, the, migration, period, dutch, is, part, of, the, west, germanic, group, which, also, includes, english, scots, frisian, low, german, old, saxon, and, high, german, it, is, characterised, by, a, number, of, phonological, and, morphological, innovations, not, found, in, north, or, east, germanic, the, west, germanic, varieties, of, the, time, are, generally, split, into, three, dialect, groups, ingvaeonic, north, sea, germanic, istvaeonic, weser, rhine, germanic, and, irminonic, elbe, germanic, it, appears, that, the, frankish, tribes, fit, primarily, into, the, istvaeonic, dialect, group, with, certain, ingvaeonic, influences, towards, the, northwest, which, are, still, seen, in, modern, dutch, the, frankish, language, itself, is, not, directly, attested, the, only, possible, exception, being, the, bergakker, inscription, found, near, the, dutch, city, of, tiel, which, may, represent, a, primary, record, of, 5th, century, frankish, although, some, place, names, recorded, in, roman, texts, such, as, vadam, modern, dutch, wad, english, mudflat, could, arguably, be, considered, as, the, oldest, single, dutch, words, the, bergakker, inscription, yields, the, oldest, evidence, of, dutch, morphology, however, interpretations, of, the, rest, of, the, text, lack, any, consensus, the, franks, emerged, in, the, southern, netherlands, salian, franks, and, central, germany, ripuarian, franks, and, later, descended, into, gaul, the, name, of, their, kingdom, survives, in, that, of, france, although, they, ruled, the, gallo, romans, for, nearly, 300, years, their, language, frankish, became, extinct, in, most, of, france, and, was, replaced, by, later, forms, of, the, language, throughout, luxembourg, and, germany, in, around, the, 7th, century, it, was, replaced, in, france, by, old, french, a, romance, language, with, a, considerable, old, frankish, influence, however, the, old, franconian, language, did, not, die, out, at, large, as, it, continued, to, be, spoken, in, the, low, countries, and, subsequently, evolved, into, what, is, now, called, old, low, franconian, or, old, dutch, in, the, low, countries, in, fact, old, frankish, could, be, reconstructed, from, old, dutch, and, frankish, loanwords, in, old, french, the, term, old, dutch, or, old, low, franconian, refers, to, the, set, of, franconian, dialects, i, e, west, germanic, varieties, that, are, assumed, to, have, evolved, from, frankish, spoken, in, the, low, countries, during, the, early, middle, ages, from, around, the, 5th, to, the, 12th, century, old, dutch, is, mostly, recorded, on, fragmentary, relics, and, words, have, been, reconstructed, from, middle, dutch, and, old, dutch, loanwords, in, french, old, dutch, is, regarded, as, the, primary, stage, in, the, development, of, a, separate, dutch, language, it, was, spoken, by, the, descendants, of, the, salian, franks, who, occupied, what, is, now, the, southern, netherlands, northern, belgium, part, of, northern, france, and, parts, of, the, lower, rhine, regions, of, germany, the, high, german, consonant, shift, moving, over, western, europe, from, south, to, west, caused, a, differentiation, with, the, central, and, high, franconian, in, germany, the, latter, would, as, a, consequence, evolve, along, with, alemannic, bavarian, and, lombardic, into, old, high, german, at, more, or, less, the, same, time, the, ingvaeonic, nasal, spirant, law, moving, over, western, europe, from, west, to, east, led, to, the, development, of, old, english, or, anglo, saxon, old, frisian, and, old, saxon, hardly, influenced, by, either, development, old, dutch, probably, remained, relatively, close, to, the, original, language, of, the, franks, however, the, language, did, experience, developments, of, its, own, such, as, very, early, final, obstruent, devoicing, in, fact, the, find, at, bergakker, indicates, that, the, language, may, already, have, experienced, this, shift, during, the, old, frankish, period, attestations, of, old, dutch, sentences, are, extremely, rare, the, language, is, mostly, recorded, on, fragmentary, relics, and, words, have, been, reconstructed, from, middle, dutch, and, loan, words, from, old, dutch, in, other, languages, the, oldest, recorded, is, found, in, the, salic, law, in, this, frankish, document, written, around, 510, the, oldest, dutch, sentence, has, been, identified, maltho, thi, afrio, lito, i, say, to, you, i, free, you, serf, used, to, free, a, serf, another, old, fragment, of, dutch, is, visc, flot, aftar, themo, uuatare, a, fish, was, swimming, in, the, water, the, oldest, conserved, larger, dutch, text, is, the, utrecht, baptismal, vow, 776, 800, starting, with, forsachistu, diobolae, ec, forsacho, diabolae, litt, forsake, you, the, devil, i, forsake, the, devil, if, only, for, its, poetic, content, the, most, famous, old, dutch, sentence, is, probably, hebban, olla, vogala, nestas, hagunnan, hinase, hic, enda, tu, wat, unbidan, we, nu, all, birds, have, started, making, nests, except, me, and, you, what, are, we, waiting, for, is, dated, to, around, the, year, 1100, written, by, a, flemish, monk, in, a, convent, in, rochester, england, since, the, sentence, speaks, to, the, imagination, it, is, often, erroneously, stated, as, the, oldest, dutch, sentence, old, dutch, naturally, evolved, into, middle, dutch, the, year, 1150, is, often, cited, as, the, time, of, the, discontinuity, but, it, actually, marks, a, time, of, profuse, dutch, writing, during, this, period, a, rich, medieval, dutch, literature, developed, there, was, at, that, time, no, overarching, standard, language, middle, dutch, is, rather, a, collective, name, for, a, number, of, closely, related, mutually, intelligible, dialects, spoken, in, the, former, old, dutch, area, where, old, dutch, fragments, are, very, hard, to, read, for, untrained, modern, dutch, speakers, the, various, literary, works, of, middle, dutch, are, somewhat, more, accessible, the, most, notable, difference, between, old, and, middle, dutch, is, in, a, feature, of, speech, known, as, vowel, reduction, whereby, vowels, in, unstressed, syllables, are, leveled, to, a, schwa, the, middle, dutch, dialect, areas, were, affected, by, political, boundaries, the, sphere, of, political, influence, of, a, certain, ruler, often, also, created, a, sphere, of, linguistic, influence, with, the, language, within, the, area, becoming, more, homogenous, following, the, contemporary, political, divisions, they, are, in, order, of, importance, a, process, of, standardisation, started, in, the, middle, ages, especially, under, the, influence, of, the, burgundian, ducal, court, in, dijon, brussels, after, 1477, the, dialects, of, flanders, and, brabant, were, the, most, influential, around, this, time, the, process, of, standardisation, became, much, stronger, at, the, start, of, the, 16th, century, mainly, based, on, the, urban, dialect, of, antwerp, the, 1585, fall, of, antwerp, to, the, spanish, army, led, to, a, flight, to, the, northern, netherlands, where, the, dutch, republic, declared, its, independence, from, spain, this, influenced, the, urban, dialects, of, the, province, of, holland, in, 1637, a, further, important, step, was, made, towards, a, unified, language, when, the, statenvertaling, the, first, major, bible, translation, into, dutch, was, created, that, people, from, all, over, the, new, republic, could, understand, it, used, elements, from, various, even, dutch, low, saxon, dialects, but, was, predominantly, based, on, the, urban, dialects, of, holland, of, post, 16th, century, in, the, southern, netherlands, now, belgium, and, luxembourg, developments, were, different, under, subsequent, spanish, austrian, and, french, rule, the, standardisation, of, dutch, language, came, to, a, standstill, the, state, law, and, increasingly, education, used, french, yet, more, than, half, the, belgian, population, were, speaking, a, variety, of, dutch, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, the, flemish, movement, stood, up, for, the, rights, of, dutch, speakers, mostly, referred, to, as, flemish, however, the, dialect, variation, was, a, serious, disadvantage, in, the, face, of, the, standardised, francophony, since, standardisation, is, a, lengthy, process, dutch, speaking, belgium, associated, itself, with, the, standard, language, that, had, already, developed, in, the, netherlands, over, the, centuries, therefore, the, situation, in, belgium, is, essentially, no, different, from, that, in, the, netherlands, although, there, are, recognisable, differences, in, pronunciation, comparable, to, the, pronunciation, differences, between, standard, british, and, standard, american, english, in, 1980, the, netherlands, and, belgium, concluded, the, language, union, treaty, this, treaty, lays, down, the, principle, that, the, two, countries, must, gear, their, language, policy, to, each, other, among, other, things, for, a, common, system, of, spelling, dutch, belongs, to, its, own, west, germanic, sub, group, the, low, franconian, languages, paired, with, its, sister, language, limburgish, or, east, low, franconian, its, closest, relative, is, the, mutually, intelligible, daughter, language, afrikaans, other, west, germanic, languages, related, to, dutch, are, german, english, and, the, un, standardised, languages, low, german, and, yiddish, dutch, stands, out, in, combining, some, ingvaeonic, characteristics, occurring, consistently, in, english, and, frisian, and, reduced, in, intensity, from, west, to, east, over, the, continental, west, germanic, plane, with, dominant, istvaeonic, characteristics, some, of, which, are, also, incorporated, in, german, unlike, german, dutch, apart, from, limburgish, has, not, been, influenced, at, all, by, the, south, to, north, movement, of, the, high, german, consonant, shift, and, had, some, changes, of, its, own, the, cumulation, of, these, changes, resulted, over, time, in, separate, but, related, standard, languages, with, various, degrees, of, similarities, and, differences, between, them, for, a, comparison, between, the, west, germanic, languages, see, the, sections, morphology, grammar, and, vocabulary, dutch, dialects, are, primarily, the, dialects, that, are, both, related, with, the, dutch, language, and, are, spoken, in, the, same, language, area, as, the, dutch, standard, language, although, heavily, under, the, influence, of, the, standard, language, some, of, them, remain, remarkably, diverse, and, are, found, in, the, netherlands, and, in, the, brussels, and, flemish, regions, of, belgium, the, areas, in, which, they, are, spoken, often, correspond, with, former, mediaeval, counties, and, duchies, the, netherlands, but, not, belgium, distinguishes, between, a, dialect, and, a, streektaal, regional, language, those, words, are, actually, more, political, than, linguistic, because, a, regional, language, unites, a, large, group, of, very, different, varieties, such, is, the, case, with, the, gronings, dialect, which, is, considered, a, variety, of, the, dutch, low, saxon, regional, language, but, it, is, relatively, distinct, from, other, dutch, low, saxon, varieties, also, some, dutch, dialects, are, more, remote, from, the, dutch, standard, language, than, some, varieties, of, a, regional, language, are, within, the, netherlands, a, further, distinction, is, made, between, a, regional, language, and, a, separate, language, which, is, the, case, with, the, standardised, west, frisian, language, it, is, spoken, alongside, dutch, in, the, province, of, friesland, dutch, dialects, and, regional, languages, are, not, spoken, as, often, as, they, used, to, be, especially, in, the, netherlands, recent, research, by, geert, driessen, shows, that, the, use, of, dialects, and, regional, languages, among, both, dutch, adults, and, youth, is, in, heavy, decline, in, 1995, 27, percent, of, the, dutch, adult, population, spoke, a, dialect, or, regional, language, on, a, regular, basis, but, in, 2011, that, was, no, more, than, 11, percent, in, 1995, 12, percent, of, children, of, primary, school, age, spoke, a, dialect, or, regional, language, but, in, 2011, that, had, declined, to, four, percent, of, the, officially, recognised, regional, languages, limburgish, is, spoken, the, most, in, 2011, among, adults, 54, among, children, 31, and, dutch, low, saxon, the, least, adults, 15, children, 1, the, decline, of, the, west, frisian, language, in, friesland, occupies, a, middle, position, adults, 44, children, 22, dialects, are, most, often, spoken, in, rural, areas, but, many, cities, have, a, distinct, city, dialect, for, example, the, city, of, ghent, has, very, distinct, g, e, and, r, sounds, that, greatly, differ, from, its, surrounding, villages, the, brussels, dialect, combines, brabantian, with, words, adopted, from, walloon, and, french, some, dialects, had, until, recently, extensions, across, the, borders, of, other, standard, language, areas, in, most, cases, the, heavy, influence, of, the, standard, language, has, broken, the, dialect, continuum, examples, are, the, gronings, dialect, spoken, in, groningen, as, well, as, the, closely, related, varieties, in, adjacent, east, frisia, germany, kleverlandish, is, a, dialect, spoken, in, southern, gelderland, the, northern, tip, of, limburg, and, northeast, of, north, brabant, netherlands, but, also, in, adjacent, parts, of, north, rhine, westphalia, germany, limburgish, limburgs, is, spoken, in, limburg, belgium, as, well, as, in, the, remaining, part, of, limburg, netherlands, and, extends, across, the, german, border, west, flemish, westvlaams, is, spoken, in, west, flanders, the, western, part, of, zeelandic, flanders, and, also, in, french, flanders, where, it, virtually, became, extinct, to, make, way, for, french, the, west, flemish, group, of, dialects, spoken, in, west, flanders, and, zeeland, is, so, distinct, that, it, might, be, considered, as, a, separate, language, variant, although, the, strong, significance, of, language, in, belgian, politics, would, prevent, the, government, from, classifying, them, as, such, an, oddity, of, the, dialect, is, that, the, voiced, velar, fricative, written, as, g, in, dutch, shifts, to, a, voiced, glottal, fricative, written, as, h, in, dutch, while, the, letter, h, becomes, mute, like, in, french, as, a, result, when, west, flemings, try, to, talk, standard, dutch, they, are, often, unable, to, pronounce, the, g, sound, and, pronounce, it, similar, to, the, h, sound, this, leaves, for, example, no, difference, between, held, hero, and, geld, money, or, in, some, cases, they, are, aware, of, the, problem, and, hyper, correct, the, h, into, a, voiced, velar, fricative, or, g, sound, again, leaving, no, difference, the, west, flemish, variety, historically, spoken, in, adjacent, parts, in, france, is, sometimes, called, french, flemish, and, is, listed, as, a, french, minority, language, however, only, a, very, small, and, aging, minority, of, the, french, flemish, population, still, speaks, and, understands, west, flemish, hollandic, is, spoken, in, holland, and, utrecht, though, the, original, forms, of, this, dialect, which, were, heavily, influenced, by, a, west, frisian, substratum, and, from, the, 16th, century, on, by, brabantian, dialects, are, now, relatively, rare, the, urban, dialects, of, the, randstad, which, are, hollandic, dialects, do, not, diverge, from, standard, dutch, very, much, but, there, is, a, clear, difference, between, the, city, dialects, of, rotterdam, the, hague, amsterdam, and, utrecht, in, some, rural, hollandic, areas, more, authentic, hollandic, dialects, are, still, being, used, especially, north, of, amsterdam, another, group, of, dialects, based, on, hollandic, is, that, spoken, in, the, cities, and, larger, towns, of, friesland, where, it, partially, displaced, west, frisian, in, the, 16th, century, and, is, known, as, stadsfries, urban, frisian, hollandic, together, with, inter, alia, kleverlandish, and, north, brabantian, but, without, stadsfries, are, the, central, dutch, dialects, brabantian, is, named, after, the, historical, duchy, of, brabant, which, corresponded, mainly, to, the, provinces, of, north, brabant, and, southern, gelderland, the, belgian, provinces, of, antwerp, and, flemish, brabant, as, well, as, brussels, where, its, native, speakers, have, become, a, minority, and, the, province, of, walloon, brabant, brabantian, expands, into, small, parts, in, the, west, of, limburg, while, its, strong, influence, on, the, east, flemish, of, east, flanders, and, eastern, zeelandic, flanders, weakens, towards, the, west, in, a, small, area, in, the, northwest, of, north, brabant, willemstad, hollandic, is, spoken, conventionally, the, kleverlandish, dialects, are, distinguished, from, brabantian, but, there, are, no, objective, criteria, apart, from, geography, to, do, so, over, 5, million, people, live, in, an, area, with, some, form, of, brabantian, being, the, predominant, colloquial, language, out, of, the, area, s, 22, million, dutch, speakers, limburgish, spoken, in, both, belgian, limburg, and, netherlands, limburg, and, in, adjacent, parts, in, germany, is, considered, a, dialect, in, belgium, while, having, obtained, the, official, status, of, regional, language, in, the, netherlands, limburgish, has, been, influenced, by, the, ripuarian, varieties, like, the, colognian, dialect, and, has, had, a, somewhat, different, development, since, the, late, middle, ages, two, dialect, groups, have, been, given, the, official, status, of, regional, language, or, streektaal, in, the, netherlands, like, several, other, dialect, groups, both, are, part, of, a, dialect, continuum, that, continues, across, the, national, border, the, dutch, low, saxon, dialect, area, comprises, the, provinces, of, groningen, drenthe, and, overijssel, as, well, as, parts, of, the, provinces, of, gelderland, flevoland, friesland, and, utrecht, this, group, which, is, not, low, franconian, but, instead, low, saxon, and, close, to, neighbouring, low, german, has, been, elevated, by, the, netherlands, and, by, germany, to, the, legal, status, of, streektaal, regional, language, according, to, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, it, is, regarded, as, dutch, for, a, number, of, reasons, from, the, 14th, to, 15th, century, onward, its, urban, centers, deventer, zwolle, kampen, zutphen, and, doesburg, have, been, increasingly, influenced, by, the, western, written, dutch, and, became, a, linguistically, mixed, area, from, the, 17th, century, onward, it, was, gradually, integrated, into, the, dutch, language, area, dutch, low, saxon, used, to, be, at, one, end, of, the, low, german, dialect, continuum, however, the, national, border, has, given, way, to, dialect, boundaries, coinciding, with, a, political, border, because, the, traditional, dialects, are, strongly, influenced, by, the, national, standard, varieties, while, a, somewhat, heterogeneous, group, of, low, franconian, dialects, limburgish, has, received, official, status, as, a, regional, language, in, the, netherlands, and, germany, but, not, in, belgium, due, to, this, official, recognition, it, receives, protection, by, chapter, 2, of, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, afrikaans, although, to, a, significant, degree, mutually, intelligible, with, dutch, is, usually, not, considered, a, dialect, but, instead, a, separate, standardised, language, it, is, spoken, in, south, africa, and, namibia, as, a, daughter, language, of, dutch, afrikaans, evolved, mainly, from, 17th, century, dutch, dialects, but, was, influenced, by, various, other, languages, in, south, africa, west, frisian, westerlauwers, fries, along, with, saterland, frisian, and, north, frisian, evolved, from, the, same, branch, of, the, west, germanic, languages, as, old, english, i, e, anglo, frisian, and, are, therefore, genetically, more, closely, related, to, english, and, scots, than, to, dutch, the, different, influences, on, the, respective, languages, however, particularly, that, of, norman, french, on, english, and, dutch, on, west, frisian, have, rendered, english, quite, distinct, from, west, frisian, and, west, frisian, less, distinct, from, dutch, than, from, english, although, under, heavy, influence, of, the, dutch, standard, language, it, is, not, mutually, intelligible, with, dutch, and, considered, a, sister, language, of, dutch, like, english, and, german, approximate, distribution, of, native, dutch,

varies, between, dialects, indeed, in, stark, contrast, to, its, written, uniformity, dutch, lacks, a, unique, prestige, dialect, and, has, a, large, dialectal, continuum, consisting, of, 28, main, dialects, which, can, themselves, be, further, divided, into, at, least, 600, distinguishable, varieties, in, the, netherlands, the, hollandic, dialect, dominates, in, national, broadcast, media,

and, history, students, in, indonesia, this, involves, about, 35, 000, students, unlike, other, european, nations, the, dutch, chose, not, to, follow, a, policy, of, language, expansion, amongst, the, indigenous, peoples, of, their, colonies, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, however, a, local, elite, gained, proficiency, in, dutch, so, as, to, meet, the, needs, of, expanding, bureaucracy, and, business, nevertheless, the, dutch, government, remained, reluctant, to, teach, dutch, on, a, large, scale, for, fear, of, destabilising, the, colony, dutch, the, language, of, power, was, supposed, to, remain, in, the, hands, of, the, leading, elite, after, independence, dutch, was, dropped, as, an, official, language, and, replaced, by, indonesian, yet, the, indonesian, language, inherited, many, words, from, dutch, words, for, everyday, life, as, well, as, scientific, and, technological, terms, one, scholar, argues, that, 20, of, indonesian, words, can, be, traced, back, to, dutch, words, many, of, which, are, transliterated, to, reflect, phonetic, pronunciation, e, g, kantoor, office, in, indonesian, is, kantor, handdoek, towel, in, indonesian, is, handuk, or, bushalte, bus, stop, in, indonesian, is, halte, bus, in, addition, many, indonesian, words, are, calques, of, dutch, for, example, rumah, sakit, hospital, is, calqued, on, the, dutch, ziekenhuis, literally, sickhouse, kebun, binatang, zoo, on, dierentuin, literally, animal, garden, undang, undang, dasar, constitution, from, grondwet, literally, ground, law, these, account, for, some, of, the,

netherlands, envisaged, the, expansion, of, dutch, in, its, colonies, in, the, west, indies, until, 1863, when, slavery, was, abolished, in, the, west, indies, slaves, were, forbidden, to, speak, dutch, with, the, effect, that, local, creoles, such, as, papiamento, and, sranan, tongo, which, were, based, not, on, dutch, but, rather, other, european, languages, became, common, in, the, dutch, west, indies, however, as, most, of, the, people, in, the, colony, of, surinam, now, suriname, worked, on, dutch, plantations, this, reinforced, the, use, of, dutch, as, a, means, for, direct, communication, in, suriname, today, dutch, is, the, sole, official, language, and, over, 60, percent, of, the, population, speaks, it, as, a, mother, tongue, dutch, is, the, obligatory, medium, of,

estimated, that, between, 90, and, 95, of, afrikaans, vocabulary, is, ultimately, of, dutch, origin, both, languages, are, still, largely, mutually, intelligible, although, this, relation, can, in, some, fields, such, as, lexicon, spelling, and, grammar, be, asymmetric, as, it, is, easier, for, dutch, speakers, to, understand, written, afrikaans, than, it, is, for, afrikaans, speakers, to, understand, written, dutch, afrikaans, is, grammatically, far, less, complex, than, dutch, and, vocabulary, items, are, generally, altered, in, a, clearly, patterned, manner, e, g, vogel, becomes, vo,

inevitably, includes, the, study, of, dutch, elsewhere, in, the, world, the, number, of, people, learning, dutch, is, relatively, small, afrikaans, is, the, third, largest, language, of, south,

always, considered, a, distinctive, feature, in, dutch, phonology, because, it, normally, occurs, with, changes, in, vowel, quality, one, feature, or, the, other, may, be, considered, redundant, and, some, phonemic, analyses, prefer, to, treat, it, as, an, opposition, of, tenseness, however, even, if, it, is, not, considered, part, of, the, phonemic, opposition, the, long, tense, vowels, are, still, realised, as, phonetically, longer, than, their, short, counterparts, the, changes, in, vowel, quality, are, also, not, always, the, same, in, all, dialects, some, of, which, may, be, little, difference, at, all, with, length, remaining, the, primary, distinguishing, feature, although, all, older, words, pair, vowel, length, with, a, change, in, vowel, quality, new, loanwords, have,

goud, zout, and, bout, corresponds, with, low, german, gold, solt, bolt, german, gold, salz, balt, and, english, gold, salt, bolt, it, is, the, most, common, diphthong, along, with, i, y, all, three, are, the, only, ones, commonly, considered, unique, phonemes, in, dutch, the, tendency, for, native, english, speakers, is, to, pronounce, dutch, names, with, i, written, as, ij, or, ei, as, a, like, the, english, long, i, which, does, not, normally, lead, to, confusion, for, native, listeners, since, in, a, number, of, dialects, such, as, in, amsterdam, the, same, pronunciation, is, heard, in, contrast, i, and, i, are, rare, in, dutch, the, long, tense, diphthongs, are, indeed, realised, as, proper, diphthongs, but, are, generally, analysed, phonemically, as, a, long, tense, vowel, followed, by, a, glide, j, or, all, diphthongs, end, in, a, close, vowel, i, y, u, and, are, grouped, here, by, their, first, element, the, syllable, structure, of, dutch, is, c, c, c, v, c, c, c, c,

speakers, pronounce, ij, ei, ou, au, and, ui, which, used, to, be, pronounced, respectively, as, i, u, and, y, as, increasingly, lowered, to, and, respectively, in, addition, the, same, speakers, pronounce, e, o, and, as, the, diphthongs, and, respectively, making, the, change, an, example, of, a, chain, shift, the, change, is, interesting, from, a, sociolinguistic, point, of, view, because, it, has, apparently, happened, relatively, recently, in, the, 1970s, and, was, pioneered, by, older, well, educated, women, from, the, upper, middle, classes, the, lowering, of, the, diphthongs, has, long, been, current, in, many, dutch, dialects, and, is, comparable, to, the, english, great, vowel, shift, and, the, diphthongisation, of, long, high, vowels, in, modern, high, german, which, had, centuries, earlier, reached, the, state, now, found, in, polder, dutch, stroop, theorises, that, the, lowering, of, open, mid, to, open, diphthongs, is, a, phonetically, natural, and, inevitable, development, and, that, dutch, after, it, had, diphthongised, the, long, high, vowels, like, german, and, english, should, have, lowered, the, diphthongs, like, german, and, english, as, well, instead, he, argues, that, the, development, has, been, artificially, frozen, in, an, intermediate, state, by, the, standardisation, of, dutch, pronunciation, in, the, 16th, century, in, which, lowered, diphthongs, found, in, rural, dialects, were, perceived, as, ugly, by, the, educated, classes, and, were, accordingly, declared, substandard, now, however, he, thinks, that, the, newly, affluent, and, independent, women, can, afford, to, let, that, natural, development, take, place, in, their, speech, stroop, compares, the, role, of, polder, dutch, with, the, urban, variety, of, british, english, pronunciation, called, estuary, english, among, belgian, and, surinamese, dutch, speakers, and, speakers, from, other, regions, in, the, netherlands, this, vowel, shift, is, not, taking, place, dutch, is, grammatically, similar, to, german, such, as, in, syntax, and, verb, morphology, for, verb, morphology, in, english, verbs, dutch, and, german, see, germanic, weak, verb, and, germanic, strong, verb, grammatical, cases, have, largely, become, limited, to, pronouns, and, many, set, phrases, inflected, forms, of, the, articles, are, often, grace, surnames, and, toponyms, standard, dutch, uses, three, genders, across, natural, and, grammatical, genders, but, for, most, non, belgian, speakers, masculine, and, feminine, have, merged, to, form, the, common, gender, with, de, for, the, the, neuter, which, uses, het, remains, distinct, this, is, similar, to, those, of, most, continental, scandinavian, tongues, less, so, than, english, inflectional, grammar, such, as, in, adjectival, and, noun, endings, has, simplified, when, grouped, according, to, their, conjugational, class, dutch, has, four, main, verb, types, weak, verbs, strong, verbs, irregular, verbs, and, mixed, verbs, weak, verbs, are, most, numerous, constituting, about, 60, of, all, verbs, in, these, the, past, tense, and, past, participle, are, formed, with, a, dental, suffix, strong, verbs, are, the, second, most, numerous, verb, group, this, group, is, characterised, by, a, vowel, alternation, of, the, stem, in, the, past, tense, and, perfect, participle, dutch, distinguishes, between, 7, classes, comprising, almost, all, strong, verbs, with, some, internal, variants, dutch, has, many, half, strong, verbs, these, have, a, weak, past, tense, and, a, strong, participle, or, a, strong, past, tense, and, a, weak, participle, the, following, table, shows, the, vowel, alternations, in, more, detail, it, also, shows, the, number, of, roots, bare, verbs, that, belong, to, each, class, variants, with, a, prefix, are, excluded, there, is, an, ongoing, process, of, weakening, of, strong, verbs, the, verb, ervaren, to, experience, used, to, be, strictly, a, class, 6, strong, verb, having, the, past, tense, ervoer, and, participle, ervaren, but, the, weak, form, ervaarde, for, both, past, tense, and, participle, is, currently, also, in, use, some, other, verbs, that, were, originally, strong, such, as, raden, to, guess, and, stoten, to, bump, have, past, tense, forms, ried, and, stiet, that, are, at, present, far, less, common, than, their, weakened, forms, raadde, and, stootte, in, most, examples, of, such, weakened, verbs, that, were, originally, strong, both, their, strong, and, weak, formations, are, deemed, correct, as, in, english, the, case, system, of, dutch, and, the, subjunctive, have, largely, fallen, out, of, use, and, the, system, has, generalised, the, dative, over, the, accusative, case, for, certain, pronouns, nl, me, je, en, me, you, li, mi, di, vs, de, mich, mir, dich, dir, while, standard, dutch, has, three, grammatical, genders, this, has, few, consequences, and, the, masculine, and, feminine, gender, are, usually, merged, into, a, common, gender, in, the, netherlands, but, not, in, belgium, en, none, nl, li, common, and, neuter, in, belgium, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, is, in, use, modern, dutch, has, mostly, lost, its, case, system, however, certain, idioms, and, expressions, continue, to, include, now, archaic, case, declensions, the, definite, article, has, just, two, forms, de, and, het, more, complex, than, english, which, has, only, the, the, use, of, the, older, inflected, form, den, in, the, dative, and, accusative, as, well, as, use, of, der, in, the, dative, is, restricted, to, numerous, set, phrases, surnames, and, toponyms, but, some, dialects, still, use, both, particularly, der, is, often, used, instead, of, haar, her, in, modern, dutch, the, genitive, articles, des, and, der, in, the, bottom, line, are, commonly, used, in, idioms, other, usage, is, typically, considered, archaic, poetic, or, stylistic, one, must, know, whether, a, noun, is, masculine, or, feminine, to, use, them, correctly, in, most, circumstances, the, preposition, van, the, middle, line, is, instead, used, followed, by, the, normal, article, de, or, het, and, in, that, case, it, makes, no, difference, whether, a, word, is, masculine, or, feminine, for, the, idiomatic, use, of, the, articles, in, the, genitive, see, for, example, in, contemporary, usage, the, genitive, case, still, occurs, a, little, more, often, with, plurals, than, with, singulars, as, the, plural, article, is, der, for, all, genders, and, no, special, noun, inflection, must, be, taken, account, of, der, is, commonly, used, in, order, to, avoid, reduplication, of, van, e, g, het, merendeel, der, gedichten, van, de, auteur, instead, of, het, merendeel, van, de, gedichten, van, de, auteur, the, bulk, of, the, author, s, poems, there, is, also, a, genitive, form, for, the, pronoun, die, dat, that, those, namely, diens, for, masculine, and, neuter, singulars, occurrences, of, dier, for, feminine, singular, and, all, plurals, are, extremely, rare, although, usually, avoided, in, common, speech, this, form, can, be, used, instead, of, possessive, pronouns, to, avoid, confusion, compare, analogically, the, relative, and, interrogative, pronoun, wie, who, has, the, genitive, forms, wiens, and, wier, corresponding, to, english, whose, but, less, frequent, in, use, dutch, also, has, a, range, of, fixed, expressions, that, make, use, of, the, genitive, articles, which, can, be, abbreviated, using, apostrophes, common, examples, include, s, ochtends, with, s, as, abbreviation, of, des, in, the, morning, and, desnoods, lit, of, the, need, translated, if, necessary, the, dutch, written, grammar, has, simplified, over, the, past, 100, years, cases, are, now, mainly, used, for, the, pronouns, such, as, ik, i, mij, me, me, mijn, my, wie, who, wiens, whose, masculine, or, neuter, singular, wier, whose, feminine, singular, masculine, feminine, or, neuter, plural, nouns, and, adjectives, are, not, case, inflected, except, for, the, genitive, of, proper, nouns, names, s, s, or, in, the, spoken, language, cases, and, case, inflections, had, already, gradually, disappeared, from, a, much, earlier, date, on, probably, the, 15th, century, as, in, many, continental, west, germanic, dialects, inflection, of, adjectives, is, more, complicated, the, adjective, receives, no, ending, with, indefinite, neuter, nouns, in, singular, as, with, een, n, a, an, and, e, in, all, other, cases, this, was, also, the, case, in, middle, english, as, in, a, good, e, man, fiets, belongs, to, the, masculine, feminine, category, while, water, and, huis, are, neuter, an, adjective, has, no, e, if, it, is, in, the, predicative, de, soep, is, koud, more, complex, inflection, is, still, found, in, certain, lexicalised, expressions, like, de, heer, de, s, hui, zes, literally, the, man, of, the, house, etc, these, are, usually, remnants, of, cases, in, this, instance, the, genitive, case, which, is, still, used, in, german, cf, der, herr, des, hauses, and, other, inflections, no, longer, in, general, use, today, in, such, lexicalised, expressions, remnants, of, strong, and, weak, nouns, can, be, found, too, e, g, in, het, jaar, de, s, her, en, anno, domini, where, en, is, actually, the, genitive, ending, of, the, weak, noun, similarly, in, some, place, names, s, grav, en, brakel, s, hertog, en, bosch, etc, with, weak, genitives, of, graaf, count, hertog, duke, also, in, this, case, german, retains, this, feature, dutch, shares, much, of, its, word, order, with, german, dutch, exhibits, subject, object, verb, word, order, but, in, main, clauses, the, conjugated, verb, is, moved, into, the, second, position, in, what, is, known, as, verb, second, or, v2, word, order, this, makes, dutch, word, order, almost, identical, to, that, of, german, but, often, different, from, english, which, has, subject, verb, object, word, order, and, has, since, lost, the, v2, word, order, that, existed, in, old, english, an, example, sentence, used, in, some, dutch, language, courses, and, textbooks, is, ik, kan, mijn, pen, niet, vinden, omdat, het, veel, te, donker, is, which, translates, into, english, word, for, word, as, i, can, my, pen, not, find, because, it, far, too, dark, is, but, in, standard, english, word, order, would, be, written, i, cannot, find, my, pen, because, it, is, far, too, dark, if, the, sentence, is, split, into, a, main, and, subclause, and, the, verbs, highlighted, the, logic, behind, the, word, order, can, be, seen, main, clause, ik, kan, mijn, pen, niet, vinden, verb, infinitives, are, placed, in, final, position, but, the, finite, conjugated, verb, in, this, case, kan, can, is, made, the, second, element, of, the, clause, in, subordinate, clauses, omdat, het, veel, te, donker, is, the, verb, or, verbs, always, go, in, the, final, position, in, an, interrogative, main, clause, the, usual, word, order, is, conjugated, verb, followed, by, subject, other, verbs, in, final, position, in, the, dutch, equivalent, of, a, wh, question, the, word, order, is, interrogative, pronoun, or, expression, conjugated, verb, subject, other, verbs, in, final, position, in, a, tag, question, the, word, order, is, the, same, as, in, a, declarative, clause, a, subordinate, clause, does, not, change, its, word, order, in, dutch, the, diminutive, is, used, extensively, the, nuances, of, meaning, expressed, by, the, diminutive, are, a, distinctive, aspect, of, dutch, and, can, be, difficult, for, non, native, speakers, to, master, it, is, very, productive, 61, and, formed, by, adding, one, of, the, suffixes, to, the, noun, in, question, depending, on, the, latter, s, phonological, ending, the, diminutive, suffixes, ke, from, which, tje, has, derived, by, palatalisation, eke, ske, ie, only, for, words, ending, ch, k, p, or, s, kie, instead, of, kje, and, pie, instead, of, pje, are, used, in, southern, dialects, and, the, forms, ending, on, ie, as, well, in, northern, urban, dialects, some, of, these, form, part, of, expressions, that, became, standard, language, like, een, makkie, from, ge, mak, ease, the, noun, joch, young, boy, has, exceptionally, only, the, diminutive, form, jochie, also, in, standard, dutch, the, form, ke, is, also, found, in, many, women, s, given, names, janneke, marieke, marijke, mieke, meike, etc, in, dutch, the, diminutive, is, not, restricted, to, nouns, but, can, be, applied, to, numerals, met, z, n, tweetjes, the, two, of, us, pronouns, onderonsje, t, te, t, te, verbal, particles, moetje, shotgun, marriage, and, even, prepositions, toetje, dessert, 64, 65, adjectives, and, adverbs, commonly, take, diminutive, forms, the, former, take, a, diminutive, ending, and, thus, function, as, nouns, while, the, latter, remain, adverbs, and, always, have, the, diminutive, with, the, s, appended, e, g, adjective, groen, green, noun, groen, tje, rookie, adverb, even, a, while, adverb, even, tjes, a, little, while, some, nouns, have, two, different, diminutives, each, with, a, different, meaning, bloem, flower, bloem, pje, lit, small, flower, but, bloem, etje, lit, also, small, flower, meaning, bouquet, a, few, nouns, exist, solely, in, a, diminutive, form, e, g, zeepaardje, seahorse, while, many, e, g, meisje, girl, originally, a, diminutive, of, meid, maid, have, acquired, a, meaning, independent, of, their, non, diminutive, forms, a, diminutive, can, sometimes, be, added, to, an, uncountable, noun, to, refer, to, a, single, portion, ijs, ice, ice, cream, ijsje, ice, cream, treat, cone, of, ice, cream, bier, beer, biertje, some, diminutive, forms, only, exist, in, the, plural, e, g, kleertjes, clothing, when, used, to, refer, to, time, the, dutch, diminutive, form, can, indicate, whether, the, person, in, question, found, it, pleasant, or, not, een, uur, tje, kletsen, chatting, for, a, little, hour, the, diminutive, can, however, also, be, used, pejoratively, hij, was, weer, eens, het, mannetje, he, acted, as, if, he, was, the, little, man, all, diminutives, even, lexicalised, ones, like, meisje, girl, have, neuter, gender, and, take, neuter, concords, dit, kleine, meisje, not, deze, kleine, meisje, there, are, two, series, of, personal, pronouns, subject, and, objects, pronouns, the, forms, on, the, right, hand, sides, within, each, column, are, the, unemphatic, forms, those, not, normally, written, are, given, in, brackets, only, ons, and, u, do, not, have, an, unemphatic, form, the, distinction, between, emphatic, and, unemphatic, pronouns, is, very, important, in, dutch, 67, emphatic, pronouns, in, english, use, the, reflexive, pronoun, form, but, are, used, to, emphasise, the, subject, not, to, indicate, a, direct, or, indirect, object, for, example, i, gave, to, myself, the, money, is, reflexive, but, i, myself, gave, the, money, to, someone, else, is, emphatic, like, english, dutch, has, generalised, the, dative, over, the, accusative, case, for, all, pronouns, e, g, nl, me, je, en, me, you, vs, de, mich, mir, dich, dir, there, is, one, exception, the, standard, language, prescribes, that, in, the, third, person, plural, hen, is, to, be, used, for, the, direct, object, and, hun, for, the, indirect, object, this, distinction, was, artificially, introduced, in, the, 17th, century, by, grammarians, and, is, largely, ignored, in, spoken, language, and, not, well, understood, by, dutch, speakers, consequently, the, third, person, plural, forms, hun, and, hen, are, interchangeable, in, normal, usage, with, hun, being, more, common, the, shared, unstressed, form, ze, is, also, often, used, as, both, direct, and, indirect, objects, and, is, a, useful, avoidance, strategy, when, people, are, unsure, which, form, to, use, dutch, also, shares, with, english, the, presence, of, h, pronouns, e, g, nl, hij, hem, haar, hen, hun, and, en, he, him, her, vs, de, er, ihn, ihr, ihnen, like, most, germanic, languages, dutch, forms, noun, compounds, where, the, first, noun, modifies, the, category, given, by, the, second, hondenhok, doghouse, unlike, english, where, newer, compounds, or, combinations, of, longer, nouns, are, often, written, in, open, form, with, separating, spaces, dutch, like, the, other, germanic, languages, either, uses, the, closed, form, without, spaces, boomhut, tree, house, or, inserts, a, hyphen, vvd, coryfee, outstanding, member, of, the, vvd, a, political, party, like, german, dutch, allows, arbitrarily, long, compounds, but, the, longer, they, get, the, less, frequent, they, tend, to, be, the, longest, serious, entry, in, the, van, dale, dictionary, is, wapenstilstandsonderhandeling, ceasefire, negotiation, leafing, through, the, articles, of, association, statuten, one, may, come, across, a, 30, letter, vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid, authorisation, of, representation, an, even, longer, word, cropping, up, in, official, documents, is, ziektekostenverzekeringsmaatschappij, health, insurance, company, though, the, shorter, zorgverzekeraar, health, insurer, is, more, common, notwithstanding, official, spelling, rules, some, dutch, speaking, people, like, some, scandinavians, and, german, speakers, nowadays, tend, to, write, the, parts, of, a, compound, separately, a, practice, sometimes, dubbed, de, engelse, ziekte, the, english, disease, dutch, vocabulary, is, predominantly, germanic, in, origin, with, loanwords, accounting, for, 20, the, main, foreign, influence, on, dutch, vocabulary, since, the, 12th, century, and, culminating, in, the, french, period, has, been, french, and, northern, o, l, languages, accounting, for, an, estimated, 6, 8, of, all, words, or, more, than, a, third, of, all, loanwords, latin, which, was, spoken, in, the, southern, low, countries, for, centuries, and, then, played, a, major, role, as, the, language, of, science, and, religion, follows, with, 6, 1, high, german, and, low, german, were, influential, until, the, mid, 20th, century, and, account, for, 2, 7, but, they, are, mostly, unrecognisable, since, many, have, been, dutchified, german, fremdling, dutch, vreemdeling, dutch, has, borrowed, words, from, english, since, the, mid, 19th, century, as, a, consequence, of, the, increasing, power, and, influence, of, britain, and, the, united, states, english, loanwords, are, about, 1, 5, but, continue, to, increase, many, english, loanwords, become, less, visible, over, time, as, they, are, either, gradually, replaced, by, calques, skyscraper, became, dutch, wolkenkrabber, or, neologisms, bucket, list, became, loodjeslijst, conversely, dutch, contributed, many, loanwords, to, english, accounting, for, 1, 3, of, its, lexicon, the, main, dutch, dictionary,

latin, script, dutch, uses, one, additional, character, beyond, the, standard, alphabet, the, digraph, ij, it, has, a, relatively, high, proportion, of, doubled, letters, both, vowels, and, consonants, due, to, the, formation, of, compound, words, and, also, to, the, spelling, devices, for, distinguishing, the, many, vowel, sounds, in, the, dutch, language, an, example, of, five, consecutive, doubled, letters, is, the, word, voorraaddoos, food, storage, container, the, diaeresis, dutch, trema, is, used, to, mark, vowels, that, are, pronounced, separately, when, involving, a,

other, diacritical, marks, occur, only, in, loanwords, however, the, acute, accent, can, also, be, used, for, emphasis, or, to, differentiate, between, two, forms, and, its, most, common, use, is, to, differentiate, between, the, indefinite, article, een, n, a, an, and, the, numeral, n, e, n, one, since, the, 1980s, the, dutch, language, union, has, been, given, the, mandate, to, review, and, make,
