may, result, in, issuing, and, holding, equity, or, may, be, only, governed, by, a, contract, partnerships, have, a, long, history, they, were, already, in, use, in, medieval, times, in, europe, and, in, the, middle, east, according, to, a, 2006, article, the, first, partnership, was, implemented, in, 1383, by, francesco, di, marco, datini, a, merchant, of, prato, and, florence, the, covoni, company, 1336, 40, and, the, del, buono, bencivenni, company, 1336, 40, have, also, been, referred, to, as, early, partnerships, but, they, were, not, formal, partnerships, in, europe, the, partnerships, contributed, to, the, commercial, revolution, which, started, in, the, 13th, century, in, the, 15th, century, the, cities, of, the, hanseatic, league, would, mutually, strengthen, each, other, a, ship, from, hamburg, to, gdansk, would, not, only, carry, its, own, cargo, but, was, also, commissioned, to, transport, freight, for, other, members, of, the, league, this, practice, not, only, saved, time, and, money, but, also, constituted, a, first, step, toward, partnership, this, capacity, to, join, forces, in, reciprocal, services, became, a, distinctive, feature, and, a, long, lasting, success, factor, of, the, hanseatic, team, spirit, a, close, examination, of, medieval, trade, in, europe, shows, that, numerous, significant, credit, based, trades, were, not, bearing, interest, hence, pragmatism, and, common, sense, called, for, a, fair, compensation, for, the, risk, of, lending, money, and, a, compensation, for, the, opportunity, cost, of, lending, money, without, using, it, for, other, fruitful, purposes, to, circumvent, the, usury, laws, edicted, by, the, church, other, forms, of, reward, were, created, in, particular, through, the, widespread, form, of, partnership, called, commenda, very, popular, with, italian, merchant, bankers, florentine, merchant, banks, were, almost, sure, to, make, a, positive, return, on, their, loans, but, this, would, be, before, taking, into, account, solvency, risks, in, the, middle, east, the, qirad, and, mudarabas, institutions, developed, when, trade, with, the, levant, namely, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, muslim, near, east, flourished, and, when, early, trading, companies, contracts, bills, of, exchange, and, long, distance, international, trade, were, established, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, levant, trade, revived, from, the, 10th, to, 11th, century, in, byzantine, italy, the, eastern, and, western, mediterranean, formed, part, of, a, single, commercial, civilization, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, two, regions, were, economically, interdependent, through, trade, in, varying, degrees, the, mongols, adopted, and, developed, the, concepts, of, liability, in, relation, to, investments, and, loans, in, mongol, ortoq, partnerships, promoting, trade, and, investment, to, facilitate, the, commercial, integration, of, the, mongol, empire, the, contractual, features, of, a, mongol, ortoq, partnership, closely, resembled, that, of, qirad, and, commenda, arrangements, however, mongol, investors, used, metal, coins, paper, money, gold, and, silver, ingots, and, tradable, goods, for, partnership, investments, and, primarily, financed, money, lending, and, trade, activities, moreover, mongol, elites, formed, trade, partnerships, with, merchants, from, central, and, western, asia, and, europe, including, marco, polo, s, family, to, come, into, being, every, partnership, necessarily, involves, a, partnership, agreement, even, if, it, has, not, been, reduced, to, writing, in, common, law, jurisdictions, a, written, partnership, agreement, is, not, legally, required, but, partners, may, benefit, from, a, partnership, agreement, that, articulates, the, important, terms, of, their, relationship, in, business, two, or, more, companies, join, forces, in, a, joint, venture, a, buyer, supplier, relationship, a, strategic, alliance, or, a, consortium, to, i, work, on, a, project, e, g, industrial, or, research, project, which, would, be, too, heavy, or, too, risky, for, a, single, entity, ii, join, forces, to, have, a, stronger, position, on, the, market, iii, comply, with, specific, regulation, e, g, in, some, emerging, countries, foreigners, can, only, invest, in, the, form, of, partnerships, with, local, entrepreneurs, in, this, case, the, alliance, may, be, structured, in, a, process, comparable, to, a, mergers, acquisitions, transaction, a, large, literature, in, business, and, management, has, paid, attention, to, forming, and, managing, partnership, agreements, it, has, in, particular, shown, the, role, of, contracts, and, relational, mechanisms, to, organize, business, partnerships, partnerships, present, the, involved, parties, with, complex, negotiations, and, special, challenges, that, must, be, navigated, to, agreement, overarching, goals, levels, of, give, and, take, areas, of, responsibility, lines, of, authority, and, succession, how, success, is, evaluated, and, distributed, and, often, a, variety, of, other, factors, must, all, be, negotiated, once, an, agreement, is, reached, the, partnership, is, typically, enforceable, by, civil, law, especially, if, well, documented, partners, who, wish, to, make, their, agreement, affirmatively, explicit, and, enforceable, typically, draw, up, articles, of, partnership, trust, and, pragmatism, are, also, essential, as, it, cannot, be, expected, that, everything, can, be, written, in, the, initial, partnership, agreement, therefore, quality, governance, and, clear, communication, are, critical, success, factors, in, the, long, run, it, is, common, for, information, about, formally, partnered, entities, to, be, made, public, such, as, through, a, press, release, a, newspaper, ad, or, public, records, laws, partner, compensation, will, often, be, defined, by, the, terms, of, a, partnership, agreement, partners, who, work, for, the, partnership, may, receive, compensation, for, their, labor, before, any, division, of, profits, between, partners, in, certain, partnerships, of, individuals, particularly, law, firms, and, accountancy, firms, equity, partners, are, distinguished, from, salaried, partners, or, contract, or, income, partners, the, degree, of, control, which, each, type, of, partner, exerts, over, the, partnership, depends, on, the, relevant, partnership, agreement, although, individuals, in, both, categories, are, described, as, partners, equity, partners, and, salaried, partners, have, little, in, common, other, than, joint, and, several, liability, in, many, legal, systems, salaried, partners, are, not, technically, partners, at, all, in, the, eyes, of, the, law, however, if, their, firm, holds, them, out, as, partners, they, are, nonetheless, subject, to, joint, and, several, liabilities, in, their, most, basic, form, equity, partners, enjoy, a, fixed, share, of, the, partnership, usually, but, not, always, an, equal, share, with, the, other, partners, and, upon, distribution, of, profits, receive, a, portion, of, the, partnership, s, profits, proportionate, to, that, share, in, more, sophisticated, partnerships, different, models, exist, for, determining, either, ownership, interest, profit, distribution, or, both, two, common, alternate, approaches, to, distribution, of, profit, are, lockstep, and, source, of, origination, compensation, sometimes, referred, to, more, graphically, as, eat, what, you, kill, the, source, of, origination, compensation, is, rarely, seen, outside, of, law, firms, the, principle, is, simply, that, each, partner, receives, a, share, of, the, partnership, profits, up, to, a, certain, amount, with, any, additional, profits, being, distributed, to, the, partner, who, was, responsible, for, the, origination, of, the, work, that, generated, the, profits, british, law, firms, tend, to, use, the, lockstep, principle, whereas, american, firms, are, more, accustomed, to, source, of, origination, when, british, firm, clifford, chance, merged, with, american, firm, rogers, wells, many, of, the, difficulties, associated, with, that, merger, were, blamed, on, the, difficulties, of, merging, a, lockstep, culture, with, a, source, of, origination, culture, partnerships, recognized, by, a, government, body, may, enjoy, special, benefits, from, taxation, policy, among, developed, countries, for, example, business, partnerships, are, often, favored, over, corporations, in, taxation, policy, since, dividend, taxes, only, occur, on, profit, before, they, are, distributed, to, the, partners, however, depending, on, the, partnership, structure, and, the, jurisdiction, in, which, it, operates, owners, of, a, partnership, may, be, exposed, to, greater, personal, liability, than, they, would, as, shareholders, of, a, corporation, in, such, countries, partnerships, are, often, regulated, via, antitrust, laws, so, as, to, inhibit, monopolistic, practices, and, foster, free, market, competition, enforcement, of, the, laws, however, varies, considerably, domestic, partnerships, recognized, by, governments, typically,
