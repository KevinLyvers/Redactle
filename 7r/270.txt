critics, contend, that, the, benefits, of, wto, facilitated, free, trade, are, not, shared, equally, the, wto, precursor, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, gatt, was, established, by, a, multilateral, treaty, of, 23, countries, in, 1947, after, world, war, ii, in, the, wake, of, other, new, multilateral, institutions, dedicated, to, international, economic, cooperation, such, as, the,

never, started, as, the, u, s, and, other, signatories, did, not, ratify, the, establishment, treaty, and, so, gatt, slowly, became, a, de, facto, international, organization, seven, rounds, of, negotiations, occurred, under, gatt, 1949, to, 1979, the, first, real, gatt, trade, rounds, 1947, to, 1960, concentrated, on, further, reducing, tariffs, then, the, kennedy, round, in, the, mid,

barriers, that, do, not, take, the, form, of, tariffs, and, to, improve, the, system, adopting, a, series, of, agreements, on, non, tariff, barriers, which, in, some, cases, interpreted, existing, gatt, rules, and, in, others, broke, entirely, new, ground, because, not, all, gatt, members, accepted, these, plurilateral, agreements, they, were, often, informally, called, codes, the, uruguay, round, amended, several, of, these, codes, and, turned, them, into, multilateral, commitments, accepted, by, all, wto, members, only, four, remained, plurilateral, those, on, government, procurement, bovine, meat, civil, aircraft, and, dairy, products, but, in, 1997, wto, members, agreed, to, terminate, the, bovine, meat, and, dairy, agreements, leaving, only, two, despite, attempts, in, the, mid, 1950s, and, 1960s, to, establish, some, form, of, institutional, mechanism, for, international, trade, the, gatt, continued, to, operate, for, almost, half, a, century, as, a, semi, institutionalized, multilateral, treaty, r, gime, on, a, provisional, basis, well, before, gatt, s, 40th, anniversary, due, in, 1987, 1988, gatt, members, concluded, that, the, gatt, system, was, straining, to, adapt, to, a, globalizing, world, economy, in, response, to, problems, identified, in, the, 1982, ministerial, declaration, structural, deficiencies, spill, over, impacts, of, certain, countries, policies, on, world, trade, which, gatt, could, not, manage, etc, a, meeting, in, punta, del, este, uruguay, launched, the, eighth, gatt, round, known, as, the, uruguay, round, in, september, 1986, in, the,

member, governments, and, the, rules, are, the, outcome, of, negotiations, among, members, the, wto, agreement, foresees, votes, where, consensus, cannot, be, reached, but, the, practice, of, consensus, dominates, the, process, of, decision, making, richard, harold, steinberg, 2002, argues, that, although, the, wto, s, consensus, governance, model, provides, law, based, initial, bargaining, trading, rounds, close, through, power, based, bargaining, favoring, europe, and, the, u, s, and, may, not, lead, to, pareto, improvement, the, wto, s, dispute, settlement, system, is, the, result, of, the, evolution, of, rules, procedures, and, practices, developed, over, almost, half, a, century, under, the, gatt, 1947, in, 1994, the, wto, members, agreed, on, the, understanding, on, rules, and, procedures, governing, the, settlement, of, disputes, dsu, annexed, to, the, final, act, signed, in, marrakesh, in, 1994, dispute, settlement, is, regarded, by, the, wto, as, the, central, pillar, of, the, multilateral, trading, system, and, as, a, unique, contribution, to, the, stability, of, the, global, economy, wto, members, have, agreed, that, if, they, believe, fellow, members, are, violating, trade, rules, they, will, use, the, multilateral, system, of, settling, disputes, instead, of, taking, action, unilaterally, the, operation, of, the, wto, dispute, settlement, process, involves, case, specific, panels, appointed, by, the, dispute, settlement, body, dsb, the, appellate, body, the, director, general, and, the, wto, secretariat, arbitrators, and, advisory, experts, the, priority, is, to, settle, disputes, preferably, through, a, mutually, agreed, solution, and, provision, has, been, made, for, the, process, to, be, conducted, in, an, efficient, and, timely, manner, so, that, if, a, case, is, adjudicated, it, should, normally, take, no, more, than, one, year, for, a, panel, ruling, and, no, more, than, 16, months, if, the, case, is, appealed, if, the, complainant, deems, the, case, urgent, consideration, of, the, case, should, take, even, less, time, wto, member, nations, are, obliged, to, accept, the, process, as, exclusive, and, compulsory, according, to, a, 2018, study, in, the, journal, of, politics, states, are, less, likely, and, slower, to, enforce, wto, violations, when, the, violations, affect, states, in, a, diffuse, manner, this, is, because, states, face, collective, action, problems, with, pursuing, litigation, they, all, expect, other, states, to, carry, the, costs, of, litigation, a, 2016, study, in, international, studies, quarterly, challenges, that, the, wto, dispute, settlement, system, leads, to, greater, increases, in, trade, however, the, dispute, settlement, system, cannot, be, used, to, resolve, trade, disputes, that, arise, from, political, disagreements, when, qatar, requested, the, establishment, of, a, dispute, panel, concerning, measures, imposed, by, the, uae, other, gcc, countries, and, the, us, were, quick, to, dismiss, its, request, as, a, political, matter, stating, that, national, security, issues, were, political, and, not, appropriate, for, the, wto, dispute, system, the, process, of, becoming, a, wto, member, is, unique, to, each, applicant, country, and, the, terms, of, accession, are, dependent, upon, the, country, s, stage, of, economic, development, and, the, current, trade, regime, the, process, takes, about, five, years, on, average, but, it, can, last, longer, if, the, country, is, less, than, fully, committed, to, the, process, or, if, political, issues, interfere, the, shortest, accession, negotiation, was, that, of, the, kyrgyz, republic, while, the, longest, was, that, of, russia, which, having, first, applied, to, join, gatt, in, 1993, was, approved, for, membership, in, december, 2011, and, became, a, wto, member, on, 22, august, 2012, kazakhstan, also, had, a, long, accession, negotiation, process, the, working, party, on, the, accession, of, kazakhstan, was, established, in, 1996, and, was, approved, for, membership, in, 2015, the, second, longest, was, that, of, vanuatu, whose, working, party, on, the, accession, of, vanuatu, was, established, on, 11, july, 1995, after, a, final, meeting, of, the, working, party, in, october, 2001, vanuatu, requested, more, time, to, consider, its, accession, terms, in, 2008, it, indicated, its, interest, to, resume, and, conclude, its, wto, accession, the, working, party, on, the, accession, of, vanuatu, was, reconvened, informally, on, 4, april, 2011, to, discuss, vanuatu, s, future, wto, membership, the, re, convened, working, party, completed, its, mandate, on, 2, may, 2011, the, general, council, formally, approved, the, accession, package, of, vanuatu, on, 26, october, 2011, on, 24, august, 2012, the, wto, welcomed, vanuatu, as, its, 157th, member, an, offer, of, accession, is, only, given, once, consensus, is, reached, among, interested, parties, a, 2017, study, argues, that, political, ties, rather, than, issue, area, functional, gains, determine, who, joins, and, shows, how, geopolitical, alignment, shapes, the, demand, and, supply, sides, of, membership, the, findings, challenge, the, view, that, states, first, liberalize, trade, to, join, the, gatt, wto, instead, democracy, and, foreign, policy, similarity, encourage, states, to, join, a, country, wishing, to, accede, to, the, wto, submits, an, application, to, the, general, council, and, has, to, describe, all, aspects, of, its, trade, and, economic, policies, that, have, a, bearing, on, wto, agreements, the, application, is, submitted, to, the, wto, in, a, memorandum, which, is, examined, by, a, working, party, open, to, all, interested, wto, members, after, all, necessary, background, information, has, been, acquired, the, working, party, focuses, on, issues, of, discrepancy, between, the, wto, rules, and, the, applicant, s, international, and, domestic, trade, policies, and, laws, the, working, party, determines, the, terms, and, conditions, of, entry, into, the, wto, for, the, applicant, nation, and, may, consider, transitional, periods, to, allow, countries, some, leeway, in, complying, with, the, wto, rules, the, final, phase, of, accession, involves, bilateral, negotiations, between, the, applicant, nation, and, other, working, party, members, regarding, the, concessions, and, commitments, on, tariff, levels, and, market, access, for, goods, and, services, the, new, member, s, commitments, are, to, apply, equally, to, all, wto, members, under, normal, non, discrimination, rules, even, though, they, are, negotiated, bilaterally, for, instance, as, a, result, of, joining, the, wto, armenia, offered, a, 15, per, cent, ceiling, bound, tariff, rate, on, accessing, its, market, for, goods, together, with, the, tariff, bindings, being, ad, valorem, there, are, no, specific, or, compound, rates, moreover, there, are, no, tariff, rate, quotas, on, both, industrial, and, agricultural, products, armenia, s, economic, and, trade, performance, growth, was, noted, since, its, first, review, in, 2010, especially, its, revival, from, the, 2008, global, financial, crisis, with, an, average, annual, 4, gdp, growth, rate, despite, some, fluctuations, armenia, s, economy, was, marked, by, low, inflation, diminishing, poverty, and, essential, progress, in, enhancing, its, macroeconomic, steadiness, in, which, trade, in, goods, and, services, which, is, the, equivalent, of, 87, of, gdp, played, a, growing, role, when, the, bilateral, talks, conclude, the, working, party, sends, to, the, general, council, or, ministerial, conference, an, accession, package, which, includes, a, summary, of, all, the, working, party, meetings, the, protocol, of, accession, a, draft, membership, treaty, and, lists, schedules, of, the, member, to, be, commitments, once, the, general, council, or, ministerial, conference, approves, of, the, terms, of, accession, the, applicant, s, parliament, must, ratify, the, protocol, of, accession, before, it, can, become, a, member, some, countries, may, have, faced, tougher, and, a, much, longer, accession, process, due, to, challenges, during, negotiations, with, other, wto, members, such, as, vietnam, whose, negotiations, took, more, than, 11, years, before, it, became, an, official, member, in, january, 2007, the, wto, has, 166, members, and, 23, observer, governments, most, recently, on, 26, february, 2024, at, the, 13th, ministerial, conference, in, abu, dhabi, comoros, and,

tariffs, and, other, trade, barriers, have, been, significantly, reduced, thanks, to, gatt, and, wto, the, promise, that, free, trade, will, accelerate, economic, growth, reduce, poverty, and, increase, people, s, incomes, has, been, questioned, by, many, critics, economist, ha, joon, chang, argues, that, there, is, a, paradox, in, neo, liberal, beliefs, regarding, free, trade, because, the, economic, growth, of, developing, countries, was, higher, in, the, 1960, 1980, period, compared, to, the, 1980, 2000, period, even, though, its, trade, policies, are, now, far, more, liberal, than, before, also, there, are, results, of, research, that, show, that, new, countries, actively, reduce, trade, barriers, only, after, becoming, significantly, rich, from, the, results, of, the, study, wto, critics, argue, that, trade, liberalization, does, not, guarantee, economic, growth, and, certainly, not, poverty, alleviation, he, also, cites, the, example, of, el, salvador, in, the, early, 1990s, el, salvador, removed, all, quantitative, barriers, to, imports, and, also, cut, tariffs, however, the, country, s, economic, growth, remained, weak, on, the, other, hand, vietnam, which, only, began, reforming, its, economy, in, the, late, 1980s, saw, a, great, deal, of, success, by, deciding, to, follow, china, s, economic, model, and, liberalizing, slowly, along, with, implementing, safeguards, for, domestic, commerce, vietnam, has, largely, succeeded, in, accelerating, economic, growth, and, reducing, poverty, without, immediately, removing, substantial, trade, barriers, critics, also, put, forward, the, view, that, the, benefits, derived, from, wto, facilitated, free, trade, are, not, shared, equally, this, criticism, is, usually, supported, by, historical, accounts, of, the, outcomes, of, negotiations, and, or, data, showing, that, the, gap, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, continues, to, widen, especially, in, china, and, india, where, economic, inequality, was, growing, at, the, time, even, though, economic, growth, is, very, high, in, addition, wto, approaches, aiming, to, reduce, trade, barriers, can, harm, developing, countries, trade, liberalization, that, is, too, early, without, any, prominent, domestic, barriers, is, feared, to, trap, the, developing, economies, in, the, primary, sector, which, often, does, not, require, skilled, labor, and, when, these, developing, countries, decide, to, advance, their, economy, utilizing, industrialization, the, premature, domestic, industry, cannot, immediately, skyrocket, as, expected, making, it, difficult, to, compete, with, other, countries, whose, industries, are, more, advanced, studies, show, that, the, wto, boosted, trade, research, shows, that, in, the, absence, of, the, wto, the, average, country, would, face, an, increase, in, tariffs, on, their, exports, by, 32, percentage, points, the, dispute, settlement, mechanism, in, the, wto, is, one, way, in, which, trade, is, increased, according, to, a, 2017, study, in, the, journal, of, international, economic, law, nearly, all, recent, preferential, trade, agreements, ptas, reference, the, wto, explicitly, often, dozens, of, times, across, multiple, chapters, likewise, in, many, of, these, same, ptas, we, find, that, substantial, portions, of, treaty, language, sometime, the, majority, of, a, chapter, is, copied, verbatim, from, a, wto, agreement, the, presence, of, the, wto, in, ptas, has, increased, over, time, world, portal
