a, few, remaining, forms, of, product, differentiation, brand, equity, is, the, measurable, totality, of, a, brand, s, worth, and, is, validated, by, observing, the, effectiveness, of, these,

occur, in, ancient, egyptian, tombs, dating, to, around, 2, 700, bce, over, time, purchasers, realized, that, the, brand, provided, information, about, origin, as, well, as, about, ownership, and, could, serve, as, a, guide, to, quality, branding, was, adapted, by, farmers, potters, and, traders, for, use, on, other, types, of, goods, such, as, pottery, and, ceramics, forms, of, branding, or, proto, branding, emerged, spontaneously, and, independently, throughout, africa, asia, and, europe, at, different, times, depending, on, local, conditions, seals, which, acted, as, quasi, brands, have, been, found, on, early, chinese, products, of, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 206, bce, large, numbers, of, seals, survive, from, the, harappan, civilization, of, the, indus, valley, 3, 300, 1, 300, bce, where, the, local, community, depended, heavily, on, trade, cylinder, seals, came, into, use, in, ur, in, mesopotamia, in, around, 3, 000, bce, and, facilitated, the, labelling, of, goods, and, property, and, the, use, of, maker, s, marks, on, pottery, was, commonplace, in, both, ancient, greece, and, rome, identity, marks, such, as, stamps, on, ceramics, were, also, used, in, ancient, egypt, diana, twede, has, argued, that, the, consumer, packaging, functions, of, protection, utility, and, communication, have, been, necessary, whenever, packages, were, the, object, of, transactions, she, has, shown, that, amphorae, used, in, mediterranean, trade, between, 1, 500, and, 500, bce, exhibited, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, and, markings, which, consumers, used, to, glean, information, about, the, type, of, goods, and, the, quality, the, systematic, use, of, stamped, labels, dates, from, around, the, fourth, century, bce, in, largely, pre, literate, society, the,

convey, information, about, product, quality, david, wengrow, has, argued, that, branding, became, necessary, following, the, urban, revolution, in, ancient, mesopotamia, in, the, 4th, century, bce, when, large, scale, economies, started, mass, producing, commodities, such, as, alcoholic, drinks, cosmetics, and, textiles, these, ancient, societies, imposed, strict, forms, of, quality, control, over, commodities, and, also, needed, to, convey, value, to, the, consumer, through, branding, producers, began, by, attaching, simple, stone, seals, to, products, which, over, time, gave, way, to, clay, seals, bearing, impressed, images, often, associated, with, the, producer, s, personal, identity, thus, giving, the, product, a, personality, not, all, historians, agree, that, these, markings, are, comparable, with, modern, brands, or, labels, with, some, suggesting, that, the, early, pictorial, brands, or, simple, thumbprints, used, in, pottery, should, be, termed, proto, brands, while, other, historians, argue, that, the, presence, of, these, simple, markings, does, not, imply, that, mature, brand, management, practices, operated, scholarly, studies, have, found, evidence, of, branding, packaging, and, labeling, in, antiquity, archaeological, evidence, of, potters, stamps, has, been, found, across, the, breadth, of, the, roman, empire, and, in, ancient, greece, stamps,

a, language, of, visual, symbolism, which, would, feed, into, the, evolution, of, branding, and, with, the, rise, of, the, merchant, guilds, the, use, of, marks, resurfaced, and, was, applied, to, specific, types, of, goods, by, the, 13th, century, the, use, of, maker, s, marks, had, become, evident, on, a, broad, range, of, goods, in, 1266, makers, marks, on, bread, became, compulsory, in,

use, of, branding, originating, with, the, advent, of, packaged, goods, industrialization, moved, the, production, of, many, household, items, such, as, soap, from, local, communities, to, centralized, factories, when, shipping, their, items, the, factories, would, literally, brand, their, logo, or, company, insignia, on, the, barrels, used, effectively, using, a, corporate, trademark, as, a, quasi, brand, factories, established, following, the, industrial, revolution, introduced, mass, produced, goods, and, needed, to, sell, their, products, to, a, wider, market, that, is, to, customers, previously, familiar, only, with, locally, produced, goods, it, became, apparent, that, a, generic, package, of, soap, had, difficulty, competing, with, familiar, local, products, packaged, goods, manufacturers, needed, to, convince, the, market, that, the, public, could, place, just, as, much, trust, in, the, non, local, product, gradually, manufacturers, began, using, personal, identifiers, to, differentiate, their, goods, from, generic, products, on, the, market, marketers, generally, began, to, realize, that, brands, to, which, personalities, were, attached, outsold, rival, brands, by, the, 1880s, large, manufacturers, had, learned, to, imbue, their, brands, identity, with, personality, traits, such, as, youthfulness, fun, sex, appeal, luxury, or, the, cool, factor, this, began, the, modern, practice, now, known, as, branding, where, the, consumers, buy, the, brand, instead, of, the, product, and, rely, on, the, brand, name, instead, of, a, retailer, s, recommendation, the, process, of, giving, a, brand, human, characteristics, represented, at, least, in, part, a, response, to, consumer, concerns, about, mass, produced, goods, the, quaker, oats, company, began, using, the, image, of, the, quaker, man, in, place, of, a, trademark, from, the, late, 1870s, with, great, success, pears, soap, campbell, s, soup, coca, cola, juicy, fruit, chewing, gum, and, aunt, jemima, pancake, mix, were, also, among, the, first, products, to, be, branded, in, an, effort, to, increase, the, consumer, s, familiarity, with, the, product, s, merits, other, brands, which, date, from, that, era, such, as, ben, s, original, rice, and, kellogg, s, breakfast, cereal, furnish, illustrations, of, the, trend, by, the, early, 1900s, trade, press, publications, advertising, agencies, and, advertising, experts, began, producing, books, and, pamphlets, exhorting, manufacturers, to, bypass, retailers, and, to, advertise, directly, to, consumers, with, strongly, branded, messages, around, 1900, advertising, guru, james, walter, thompson, published, a, housing, advertisement, explaining, trademark, advertising, this, was, an, early, commercial, explanation, of, what, scholars, now, recognize, as, modern, branding, and, the, beginnings, of, brand, management, this, trend, continued, to, the, 1980s, and, as, of, 2018, is, quantified, by, marketers, in, concepts, such, as, brand, value, and, brand, equity, naomi, klein, has, described, this, development, as, brand, equity, mania, in, 1988, for, example, philip, morris, companies, purchased, kraft, foods, inc, for, six, times, what, the, company, was, worth, on, paper, business, analysts, reported, that, what, they, really, purchased, was, the, brand, name, with, the, rise, of, mass, media, in, the, early, 20th, century, companies, adopted, techniques, that, allowed, their, messages, to, stand, out, slogans, mascots, and, jingles, began, to, appear, on, radio, in, the, 1920s, and, in, early, television, in, the, 1930s, soap, manufacturers, sponsored, many, of, the, earliest, radio, drama, series, and, the, genre, became, known, as, soap, opera, by, the, 1940s, manufacturers, began, to, recognize, the, way, in, which, consumers, had, started, to, develop, relationships, with, their, brands, in, a, social, psychological, anthropological, sense, advertisers, began, to, use, motivational, research, and, consumer, research, to, gather, insights, into, consumer, purchasing, strong, branded, campaigns, for, chrysler, and, exxon, esso, using, insights, drawn, from, research, into, psychology, and, cultural, anthropology, led, to, some, of, the, most, enduring, campaigns, of, the, 20th, century, brand, advertisers, began, to, imbue, goods, and, services, with, a, personality, based, on, the, insight, that, consumers, searched, for, brands, with, personalities, that, matched, their, own, effective, branding, attached, to, strong, brand, values, can, result, in, higher, sales, of, not, only, one, product, but, of, other, products, associated, with, that, brand, if, a, customer, loves, pillsbury, biscuits, and, trusts, the, brand, he, or, she, is, more, likely, to, try, other, products, offered, by, the, company, such, as, chocolate, chip, cookies, for, example, brand, development, often, performed, by, a, design, team, takes, time, to, produce, a, brand, name, is, the, part, of, a, brand, that, can, be, spoken, or, written, and, identifies, a, product, service, or, company, and, sets, it, apart, from, other, comparable, products, within, a, category, a, brand, name, may, include, words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or, any, combination, of, these, elements, for, consumers, a, brand, name, is, a, memory, heuristic, a, convenient, way, to, remember, preferred, product, choices, a, brand, name, is, not, to, be, confused, with, a, trademark, which, refers, to, the, brand, name, or, part, of, a, brand, that, is, legally, protected, for, example, coca, cola, not, only, protects, the, brand, name, coca, cola, but, also, protects, the, distinctive, spencerian, script, and, the, contoured, shape, of, the, bottle, brand, identity, is, a, collection, of, individual, components, such, as, a, name, a, design, a, set, of, images, a, slogan, a, vision, writing, style, a, particular, font, or, a, symbol, etc, which, sets, the, brand, aside, from, others, for, a, company, to, exude, a, strong, sense, of, brand, identity, it, must, have, an, in, depth, understanding, of, its, target, market, competitors, and, the, surrounding, business, environment, brand, identity, includes, both, the, core, identity, and, the, extended, identity, the, core, identity, reflects, consistent, long, term, associations, with, the, brand, whereas, the, extended, identity, involves, the, intricate, details, of, the, brand, that, help, generate, a, constant, motif, according, to, kotler, et, al, 2009, a, brand, s, identity, may, deliver, four, levels, of, meaning, a, brand, s, attributes, are, a, set, of, labels, with, which, the, corporation, wishes, to, be, associated, for, example, a, brand, may, showcase, its, primary, attribute, as, environmental, friendliness, however, a, brand, s, attributes, alone, are, not, enough, to, persuade, a, customer, into, purchasing, the, product, these, attributes, must, be, communicated, through, benefits, which, are, more, emotional, translations, if, a, brand, s, attribute, is, being, environmentally, friendly, customers, will, receive, the, benefit, of, feeling, that, they, are, helping, the, environment, by, associating, with, the, brand, aside, from, attributes, and, benefits, a, brand, s, identity, may, also, involve, branding, to, focus, on, representing, its, core, set, of, values, if, a, company, is, seen, to, symbolize, specific, values, it, will, in, turn, attract, customers, who, also, believe, in, these, values, for, example, nike, s, brand, represents, the, value, of, a, just, do, it, attitude, thus, this, form, of, brand, identification, attracts, customers, who, also, share, this, same, value, even, more, extensive, than, its, perceived, values, is, a, brand, s, personality, quite, literally, one, can, easily, describe, a, successful, brand, identity, as, if, it, were, a, person, this, form, of, brand, identity, has, proven, to, be, the, most, advantageous, in, maintaining, long, lasting, relationships, with, consumers, as, it, gives, them, a, sense, of, personal, interaction, with, the, brand, collectively, all, four, forms, of, brand, identification, help, to, deliver, a, powerful, meaning, behind, what, a, corporation, hopes, to, accomplish, and, to, explain, why, customers, should, choose, one, brand, over, its, competitors, brand, personality, refers, to, the, set, of, human, personality, traits, that, are, both, applicable, to, and, relevant, for, brands, marketers, and, consumer, researchers, often, argue, that, brands, can, be, imbued, with, human, like, characteristics, which, resonate, with, potential, consumers, such, personality, traits, can, assist, marketers, to, create, unique, brands, that, are, differentiated, from, rival, brands, aaker, conceptualized, brand, personality, as, consisting, of, five, broad, dimensions, namely, sincerity, down, to, earth, honest, wholesome, and, cheerful, excitement, daring, spirited, imaginative, and, up, to, date, competence, reliable, intelligent, and, successful, sophistication, glamorous, upper, class, charming, and, ruggedness, outdoorsy, and, tough, subsequent, research, studies, have, suggested, that, aaker, s, dimensions, of, brand, personality, are, relatively, stable, across, different, industries, market, segments, and, over, time, much, of, the, literature, on, branding, suggests, that, consumers, prefer, brands, with, personalities, that, are, congruent, with, their, own, consumers, may, distinguish, the, psychological, aspect, brand, associations, like, thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and, so, on, that, become, linked, to, the, brand, of, a, brand, from, the, experiential, aspect, the, experiential, aspect, consists, of, the, sum, of, all, points, of, contact, with, the, brand, and, is, termed, the, consumer, s, brand, experience, the, brand, is, often, intended, to, create, an, emotional, response, and, recognition, leading, to, potential, loyalty, and, repeat, purchases, the, brand, experience, is, a, brand, s, action, perceived, by, a, person, the, psychological, aspect, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, brand, image, is, a, symbolic, construct, created, within, the, minds, of, people, consisting, of, all, the, information, and, expectations, associated, with, a, product, with, a, service, or, with, the, companies, providing, them, marketers, or, product, managers, that, responsible, for, branding, seek, to, develop, or, align, the, expectations, behind, the, brand, experience, creating, the, impression, that, a, brand, associated, with, a, product, or, service, has, certain, qualities, or, characteristics, which, make, it, special, or, unique, a, brand, can, therefore, become, one, of, the, most, valuable, elements, in, an, advertising, theme, as, it, demonstrates, what, the, brand, owner, is, able, to, offer, in, the, marketplace, this, means, that, building, a, strong, brand, helps, to, distinguish, a, product, from, similar, ones, and, differentiate, it, from, competitors, the, art, of, creating, and, maintaining, a, brand, is, called, brand, management, the, orientation, of, an, entire, organization, towards, its, brand, is, called, brand, orientation, brand, orientation, develops, in, response, to, market, intelligence, careful, brand, management, seeks, to, make, products, or, services, relevant, and, meaningful, to, a, target, audience, marketers, tend, to, treat, brands, as, more, than, the, difference, between, the, actual, cost, of, a, product, and, its, selling, price, rather, brands, represent, the, sum, of, all, valuable, qualities, of, a, product, to, the, consumer, and, are, often, treated, as, the, total, investment, in, brand, building, activities, including, marketing, communications, consumers, may, look, on, branding, as, an, aspect, of, products, or, services, as, it, often, serves, to, denote, a, certain, attractive, quality, or, characteristic, see, also, brand, promise, from, the, perspective, of, brand, owners, branded, products, or, services, can, command, higher, prices, where, two, products, resemble, each, other, but, one, of, the, products, has, no, associated, branding, such, as, a, generic, store, branded, product, potential, purchasers, may, often, select, the, more, expensive, branded, product, on, the, basis, of, the, perceived, quality, of, the, brand, or, on, the, basis, of, the, reputation, of, the, brand, owner, brand, awareness, involves, a, customer, s, ability, to, recall, and, or, recognize, brands, logos, and, branded, advertising, brands, help, customers, to, understand, which, brands, or, products, belong, to, which, product, or, service, category, brands, assist, customers, to, understand, the, constellation, of, benefits, offered, by, individual, brands, and, how, a, given, brand, within, a, category, is, differentiated, from, its, competing, brands, and, thus, the, brand, helps, customers, potential, customers, understand, which, brand, satisfies, their, needs, thus, the, brand, offers, the, customer, a, short, cut, to, understanding, the, different, product, or, service, offerings, that, make, up, a, particular, category, brand, awareness, is, a, key, step, in, the, customer, s, purchase, decision, process, since, some, kind, of, awareness, is, a, precondition, to, purchasing, that, is, customers, will, not, consider, a, brand, if, they, are, not, aware, of, it, brand, awareness, is, a, key, component, in, understanding, the, effectiveness, both, of, a, brand, s, identity, and, of, its, communication, methods, successful, brands, are, those, that, consistently, generate, a, high, level, of, brand, awareness, as, this, can, be, the, pivotal, factor, in, securing, customer, transactions, various, forms, of, brand, awareness, can, be, identified, each, form, reflects, a, different, stage, in, a, customer, s, cognitive, ability, to, address, the, brand, in, a, given, circumstance, marketers, typically, identify, two, distinct, types, of, brand, awareness, namely, brand, recall, also, known, as, unaided, recall, or, occasionally, spontaneous, recall, and, brand, recognition, also, known, as, aided, brand, recall, these, types, of, awareness, operate, in, entirely, different, ways, with, important, implications, for, marketing, strategy, and, advertising, brand, recognition, is, one, of, the, initial, phases, of, brand, awareness, and, validates, whether, or, not, a, customer, remembers, being, pre, exposed, to, the, brand, brand, recognition, also, known, as, aided, brand, recall, refers, to, consumers, ability, to, correctly, differentiate, a, brand, when, they, come, into, contact, with, it, this, does, not, necessarily, require, consumers, to, identify, or, recall, the, brand, name, when, customers, experience, brand, recognition, they, are, triggered, by, either, a, visual, or, verbal, cue, for, example, when, looking, to, satisfy, a, category, need, such, as, a, toilet, paper, the, customer, would, firstly, be, presented, with, multiple, brands, to, choose, from, once, the, customer, is, visually, or, verbally, faced, with, a, brand, they, may, remember, being, introduced, to, it, before, when, given, a, cue, consumers, able, to, retrieve, the, memory, node, associated, with, the, brand, exhibit, brand, recognition, often, this, form, of, brand, awareness, assists, customers, in, choosing, one, brand, over, another, when, faced, with, a, low, involvement, purchasing, decision, brand, recognition, is, often, the, mode, of, brand, awareness, that, operates, in, retail, shopping, environments, when, presented, with, a, product, at, the, point, of, sale, or, after, viewing, its, visual, packaging, consumers, are, able, to, recognize, the, brand, and, may, be, able, to, associate, it, with, attributes, or, meanings, acquired, through, exposure, to, promotion, or, word, of, mouth, referrals, in, contrast, to, brand, recall, where, few, consumers, are, able, to, spontaneously, recall, brand, names, within, a, given, category, when, prompted, with, a, brand, name, a, larger, number, of, consumers, are, typically, able, to, recognize, it, brand, recognition, is, most, successful, when, people, can, elicit, recognition, without, being, explicitly, exposed, to, the, company, s, name, but, rather, through, visual, signifiers, like, logos, slogans, and, colors, for, example, disney, successfully, branded, its, particular, script, font, originally, created, for, walt, disney, s, signature, logo, which, it, used, in, the, logo, for, go, com, unlike, brand, recognition, brand, recall, also, known, as, unaided, brand, recall, or, spontaneous, brand, recall, is, the, ability, of, the, customer, retrieving, the, brand, correctly, from, memory, rather, than, being, given, a, choice, of, multiple, brands, to, satisfy, a, need, consumers, are, faced, with, a, need, first, and, then, must, recall, a, brand, from, their, memory, to, satisfy, that, need, this, level, of, brand, awareness, is, stronger, than, brand, recognition, as, the, brand, must, be, firmly, cemented, in, the, consumer, s, memory, to, enable, unassisted, remembrance, this, gives, the, company, huge, advantage, over, its, competitors, because, the, customer, is, already, willing, to, buy, or, at, least, know, the, company, offering, available, in, the, market, thus, brand, recall, is, a, confirmation, that, previous, branding, touchpoints, have, successfully, fermented, in, the, minds, of, its, consumers, marketing, mix, modeling, can, help, marketing, leaders, optimize, how, they, spend, marketing, budgets, to, maximize, the, impact, on, brand, awareness, or, on, sales, managing, brands, for, value, creation, will, often, involve, applying, marketing, mix, modeling, techniques, in, conjunction, with, brand, valuation, brands, typically, comprise, various, elements, such, as, although, brand, identity, is, a, fundamental, asset, to, a, brand, s, equity, the, worth, of, a, brand, s, identity, would, become, obsolete, without, ongoing, brand, communication, integrated, marketing, communications, imc, relates, to, how, a, brand, transmits, a, clear, consistent, message, to, its, stakeholders, five, key, components, comprise, imc, the, effectiveness, of, a, brand, s, communication, is, determined, by, how, accurately, the, customer, perceives, the, brand, s, intended, message, through, its, imc, although, imc, is, a, broad, strategic, concept, the, most, crucial, brand, communication, elements, are, pinpointed, to, how, the, brand, sends, a, message, and, what, touch, points, the, brand, uses, to, connect, with, its, customers, one, can, analyze, the, traditional, communication, model, into, several, consecutive, steps, when, a, brand, communicates, a, brand, identity, to, a, receiver, it, runs, the, risk, of, the, receiver, incorrectly, interpreting, the, message, therefore, a, brand, should, use, appropriate, communication, channels, to, positively, affect, how, the, psychological, and, physical, aspects, of, a, brand, are, perceived, in, order, for, brands, to, effectively, communicate, to, customers, marketers, must, consider, all, touch, point, s, or, sources, of, contact, that, a, customer, has, with, the, brand, touch, points, represent, the, channel, stage, in, the, traditional, communication, model, where, a, message, travels, from, the, sender, to, the, receiver, any, point, where, a, customer, has, an, interaction, with, the, brand, whether, watching, a, television, advertisement, hearing, about, a, brand, through, word, of, mouth, or, even, noticing, a, branded, license, plate, defines, a, touchpoint, according, to, dahlen, et, al, 2010, every, touchpoint, has, the, potential, to, add, positive, or, suppress, negative, associations, to, the, brand, s, equity, thus, a, brand, s, imc, should, cohesively, deliver, positive, messages, through, appropriate, touch, points, associated, with, its, target, market, one, methodology, involves, using, sensory, stimuli, touch, points, to, activate, customer, emotion, for, example, if, a, brand, consistently, uses, a, pleasant, smell, as, a, primary, touchpoint, the, brand, has, a, much, higher, chance, of, creating, a, positive, lasting, effect, on, its, customers, senses, as, well, as, memory, another, way, a, brand, can, ensure, that, it, is, utilizing, the, best, communication, channel, is, by, focusing, on, touchpoints, that, suit, particular, areas, associated, with, customer, experience, as, suggested, figure, 2, certain, touch, points, link, with, a, specific, stage, in, customer, brand, involvement, for, example, a, brand, may, recognize, that, advertising, touchpoints, are, most, effective, during, the, pre, purchase, experience, stage, therefore, they, may, target, their, advertisements, to, new, customers, rather, than, to, existing, customers, overall, a, brand, has, the, ability, to, strengthen, brand, equity, by, using, imc, branding, communications, through, touchpoints, brand, communication, is, important, in, ensuring, brand, success, in, the, business, world, and, refers, to, how, businesses, transmit, their, brand, messages, characteristics, and, attributes, to, their, consumers, one, method, of, brand, communication, that, companies, can, exploit, involves, electronic, word, of, mouth, ewom, ewom, is, a, relatively, new, approach, identified, to, communicate, with, consumers, one, popular, method, of, ewom, involves, social, networking, sites, snss, such, as, twitter, a, study, found, that, consumers, classed, their, relationship, with, a, brand, as, closer, if, that, brand, was, active, on, a, specific, social, media, site, twitter, research, further, found, that, the, more, consumers, retweeted, and, communicated, with, a, brand, the, more, they, trusted, the, brand, this, suggests, that, a, company, could, look, to, employ, a, social, media, campaign, to, gain, consumer, trust, and, loyalty, as, well, as, in, the, pursuit, of, communicating, brand, messages, mckee, 2014, also, looked, into, brand, communication, and, states, that, when, communicating, a, brand, a, company, should, look, to, simplify, its, message, as, this, will, lead, to, more, value, being, portrayed, as, well, as, an, increased, chance, of, target, consumers, recalling, and, recognizing, the, brand, in, 2012, riefler, stated, that, if, the, company, communicating, a, brand, is, a, global, organization, or, has, future, global, aims, that, company, should, look, to, employ, a, method, of, communication, that, is, globally, appealing, to, their, consumers, and, subsequently, choose, a, method, of, communication, with, will, be, internationally, understood, one, way, a, company, can, do, this, involves, choosing, a, product, or, service, s, brand, name, as, this, name, will, need, to, be, suitable, for, the, marketplace, that, it, aims, to, enter, it, is, important, that, if, a, company, wishes, to, develop, a, global, market, the, company, name, will, also, need, to, be, suitable, in, different, cultures, and, not, cause, offense, or, be, misunderstood, when, communicating, a, brand, a, company, needs, to, be, aware, that, they, must, not, just, visually, communicate, their, brand, message, and, should, take, advantage, of, portraying, their, message, through, multi, sensory, information, one, article, suggests, that, other, senses, apart, from, vision, need, to, be, targeted, when, trying, to, communicate, a, brand, with, consumers, for, example, a, jingle, or, background, music, can, have, a, positive, effect, on, brand, recognition, purchasing, behaviour, and, brand, recall, therefore, when, looking, to, communicate, a, brand, with, chosen, consumers, companies, should, investigate, a, channel, of, communication, that, is, most, suitable, for, their, short, term, and, long, term, aims, and, should, choose, a, method, of, communication, that, is, most, likely, to, reach, their, target, consumers, the, match, up, between, the, product, the, consumer, lifestyle, and, the, endorser, is, important, for, the, effectiveness, of, brand, communication, the, term, brand, name, is, quite, often, used, interchangeably, with, brand, although, it, is, more, correctly, used, to, specifically, denote, written, or, spoken, linguistic, elements, of, any, product, in, this, context, a, brand, name, constitutes, a, type, of, trademark, if, the, brand, name, exclusively, identifies, the, brand, owner, as, the, commercial, source, of, products, or, services, a, brand, owner, may, seek, to, protect, proprietary, rights, in, relation, to, a, brand, name, through, trademark, registration, such, trademarks, are, called, registered,

jeans, a, brandnomer, is, a, brand, name, that, has, colloquially, become, a, generic, term, for, a, product, or, service, such, as, band, aid, nylon, or, kleenex, which, are, often, used, to, describe, any, brand, of, adhesive, bandage, any, type, of, hosiery, or, any, brand, of, facial, tissue, respectively, xerox, for, example, has, become, synonymous, with, the, word, copy, a, brand, line, allows, the, introduction, of, various, subtypes, of, a, product, under, a, common, ideally, already, established, brand, name, examples, would, be, the, individual, kinder, chocolates, by, ferrero, spa, the, subtypes, of, coca, cola, or, special, editions, of, popular, brands, see, also, brand, extension, open, knowledge, foundation, created, in, december, 2013, the, bsin, brand,

because, the, identity, is, assembled, by, the, brand, owner, it, reflects, how, the, owner, wants, the, consumer, to, perceive, the, brand, and, by, extension, the, branded, company, organization, product, or, service, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, brand, image, which, is, a, customer, s, mental, picture, of, a, brand, the, brand, owner, will, seek, to, bridge, the, gap, between, the, brand,

brand, image, brand, identity, is, what, the, owner, wants, to, communicate, to, its, potential, consumers, however, over, time, a, product, s, brand, identity, may, acquire, evolve, gaining, new, attributes, from, consumer, perspective, but, not, necessarily, from, the, marketing, communications, an, owner, percolates, to, targeted, consumers, therefore, businesses, research, consumer, s, brand, associations, the, brand, identity, works, as, a, guideline, as, the, frame, in, which, a, brand, will, evolve, and, define, itself, or, in, the, words, of, david, aaker, a, unique, set, of, brand, associations, that, the, brand, strategist, aspires, to, create, or, maintain, according, to, kapferer, 2004, there, are, six, facets, to, a, brand, s, identity, color, is, a, particularly, important, element, of, visual, brand, identity, and, color, mapping, provides, an, effective, way, of, ensuring, color, contributes, to, differentiation, in, a, visually, cluttered, marketplace,

parity, is, the, perception, of, customers, that, some, brands, are, equivalent, this, means, that, shoppers, will, purchase, within, a, group, of, accepted, brands, rather, than, choosing, one, specific, brand, cranfield, management, professor, christopher, martin, has, referred, to, research, confirming, that, consumers, choose, from, a, portfolio, of, brands, and, that, factors, such, as, availability, will, be, a, major, determinant, of, actual, choice, when, brand, parity, operates, quality, is, often, not, a, major, concern, because, consumers, believe, that, only, minor, quality, differences, exist, instead, it, is, important, to, have, brand, equity, which, is, the, perception, that, a, good, or, service, with, a, given, brand, name, is, different, better, and, can, be, trusted, according, to, kenneth, e, clow, the, original, aim, of, branding, was, to, simplify, the, process, of, identifying, and, differentiating, products, over, time, manufacturers, began, to, use, branded, messages, to, give, the, brand, a, unique, personality, brands, came, to, embrace, a, performance, or, benefit, promise, for, the, product, certainly, but, eventually, also, for, the, company, behind, the, brand, today, brands, play, a, much, bigger, role, the, power, of, brands, to, communicate, a, complex, message, quickly, with, emotional, impact, and, with, the, ability, of, brands, to, attract, media, attention, makes, them, ideal, tools, in, the, hands, of, activists, cultural, conflict, over, a, brand, s, meaning, has, also, influences, the, diffusion, of, an, innovation, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, 75, of, us, customers, tried, different, stores, websites, or, brands, and, 60, of, those, expect, to, integrate, new, brands, or, stores, into, their, post, pandemic, lives, if, brands, can, find, ways, to, help, people, feel, empowered, and, regain, a, sense, of, control, in, uncertain, times, they, can, help, people, reconnect, and, heal, and, be, appreciated, for, it, often, especially, in, the, industrial, sector, brand, engineers, will, promote, a, company, s, name, exactly, how, the, company, name, relates, to, product, and, services, names, forms, part, of, a, brand, architecture, decisions, about, company, names, and, product, names, and, their, relationship, depend, on, more, than, a, dozen, strategic, considerations, in, this, case, a, strong, brand, name, or, company, name, becomes, the, vehicle, for, marketing, a, range, of, products, for, example, mercedes, benz, or, black, decker, or, a, range, of, subsidiary, brands, such, as, cadbury, dairy, milk, cadbury, flake, or, cadbury, fingers, in, the, uk, corporate, name, changes, offer, particularly, stark, examples, of, branding, related, decisions, a, name, change, may, signal, different, ownership, or, new, product, directions, thus, the, name, unisys, originated, in, 1986, when, burroughs, bought, and, incorporated, univac, and, the, newly, named, international, business, machines, represented, a, broadening, of, scope, in, 1924, from, its, original, name, the, computing, tabulating, recording, company, a, change, in, corporate, naming, may, also, have, a, role, in, seeking, to, shed, an, undesirable, image, for, example, werner, erhard, and, associates, re, branded, its, activities, as, landmark, education, in, 1991, at, a, time, when, publicity, in, a, 60, minutes, investigative, report, broadcast, cast, the, est, and, werner, erhard, brands, in, a, negative, light, and, union, carbide, india, limited, became, eveready, industries, india, in, 1994, subsequent, to, the, bhopal, disaster, of, 1984, marketers, associate, separate, products, or, lines, with, separate, brand, names, such, as, seven, up, kool, aid, or, nivea, sun, beiersdorf, which, may, compete, against, other, brands, from, the, same, company, for, example, unilever, owns, persil, omo, surf, and, lynx, a, challenger, brand, is, a, brand, in, an, industry, where, it, is, neither, the, market, leader, nor, a, niche, brand, challenger, brands, are, categorized, by, a, mindset, that, sees, them, have, business, ambitions, beyond, conventional, resources, and, an, intent, to, bring, change, to, an, industry, multiproduct, branding, strategy, is, when, a, company, uses, one, name, across, all, its, products, in, a, product, class, when, the, company, s, trade, name, is, used, multiproduct, branding, is, also, known, as, corporate, branding, family, branding, or, umbrella, branding, examples, of, companies, that, use, corporate, branding, are, microsoft, samsung, apple, and, sony, as, the, company, s, brand, name, is, identical, to, their, trade, name, other, examples, of, multiproduct, branding, strategy, include, virgin, and, church, dwight, virgin, a, multination, conglomerate, uses, the, punk, inspired, handwritten, red, logo, with, the, iconic, tick, for, all, its, products, ranging, from, airlines, hot, air, balloons, telecommunication, to, healthcare, church, dwight, a, manufacturer, of, household, products, displays, the, arm, hammer, family, brand, name, for, all, its, products, containing, baking, soda, as, the, main, ingredient, a, multiproduct, branding, strategy, has, many, advantages, it, capitalizes, on, brand, equity, as, consumers, that, have, a, good, experience, with, the, product, will, in, turn, pass, on, this, positive, opinion, to, supplementary, objects, in, the, same, product, class, as, they, share, the, same, name, consequently, the, multiproduct, branding, strategy, makes, product, line, extension, possible, a, product, line, extension, is, the, procedure, of, entering, a, new, market, segment, in, its, product, class, by, means, of, using, a, current, brand, name, an, example, of, this, is, the, campbell, soup, company, primarily, a, producer, of, canned, soups, they, utilize, a, multiproduct, branding, strategy, by, way, of, soup, line, extensions, they, have, over, 100, soup, flavours, putting, forward, varieties, such, as, regular, campbell, soup, condensed, chunky, fresh, brewed, organic, and, soup, on, the, go, this, approach, is, seen, as, favourable, as, it, can, result, in, lower, promotion, costs, and, advertising, due, to, the, same, name, being, used, on, all, products, therefore, increasing, the, level, of, brand, awareness, although, line, extension, has, potential, negative, outcomes, with, one, being, that, other, items, in, the, company, s, line, may, be, disadvantaged, because, of, the, sale, of, the, extension, line, extensions, work, at, their, best, when, they, deliver, an, increase, in, company, revenue, by, enticing, new, buyers, or, by, removing, sales, from, competitors, subbranding, is, used, by, certain, multiproduct, branding, companies, subbranding, merges, a, corporate, family, or, umbrella, brand, with, the, introduction, of, a, new, brand, in, order, to, differentiate, part, of, a, product, line, from, others, in, the, whole, brand, system, subbranding, assists, to, articulate, and, construct, offerings, it, can, alter, a, brand, s, identity, as, subbranding, can, modify, associations, of, the, parent, brand, examples, of, successful, subbranding, can, be, seen, through, gatorade, and, porsche, gatorade, a, manufacturer, of, sport, themed, food, and, beverages, effectively, introduced, gatorade, g2, a, low, calorie, line, of, gatorade, drinks, likewise, porsche, a, specialized, automobile, manufacturer, successfully, markets, its, lower, end, line, porsche, boxster, and, higher, end, line, porsche, carrera, brand, extension, is, the, system, of, employing, a, current, brand, name, to, enter, a, different, product, class, having, a, strong, brand, equity, allows, for, brand, extension, for, example, many, fashion, and, designer, companies, extended, brands, into, fragrances, shoes, and, accessories, home, textile, home, decor, luggage, sun, glasses, furniture, hotels, etc, nevertheless, brand, extension, has, its, disadvantages, there, is, a, risk, that, too, many, uses, for, one, brand, name, can, oversaturate, the, market, resulting, in, a, blurred, and, weak, brand, for, consumers, examples, of, brand, extension, can, be, seen, through, kimberly, clark, and, honda, kimberly, clark, is, a, corporation, that, produces, personal, and, health, care, products, being, able, to, extend, the, huggies, brand, name, across, a, full, line, of, toiletries, for, toddlers, and, babies, the, success, of, this, brand, extension, strategy, is, apparent, in, the, 500, million, in, annual, sales, generated, globally, similarly, honda, using, their, reputable, name, for, automobiles, has, spread, to, other, products, such, as, motorcycles, power, equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and, bikes, mars, extended, its, brand, to, ice, cream, caterpillar, to, shoes, and, watches, michelin, to, a, restaurant, guide, adidas, and, puma, to, personal, hygiene, dunlop, extended, its, brand, from, tires, to, other, rubber, products, such, as, shoes, golf, balls, tennis, racquets, and, adhesives, frequently, the, product, is, no, different, from, what, else, is, on, the, market, except, a, brand, name, marking, brand, is, product, identity, there, is, a, difference, between, brand, extension, and, line, extension, a, line, extension, is, when, a, current, brand, name, is, used, to, enter, a, new, market, segment, in, the, existing, product, class, with, new, varieties, or, flavors, or, sizes, when, coca, cola, launched, diet, coke, and, cherry, coke, they, stayed, within, the, originating, product, category, non, alcoholic, carbonated, beverages, procter, gamble, did, likewise, extending, its, strong, lines, such, as, fairy, soap, into, neighboring, products, fairy, liquid, and, fairy, automatic, within, the, same, category, dish, washing, detergents, the, risk, of, over, extension, is, brand, dilution, where, the, brand, loses, its, brand, associations, with, a, market, segment, product, area, or, quality, price, or, cachet, brand, collaborations, refer, to, the, participation, of, multiple, firms, in, a, branding, initiative, one, of, the, most, well, known, is, co, branding, a, strategy, in, which, two, firms, combine, their, brands, into, a, single, product, most, recently, brands, have, engaged, in, unconventional, brand, collaborations, defined, as, unexpected, partnerships, between, well, established, brands, and, an, unconventional, partner, seemingly, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, design, spectrum, for, example, in, 2017, louis, vuitton, partnered, with, the, skateboarding, brand, supreme, multibranding, strategy, is, when, a, company, gives, each, product, a, distinct, name, multibranding, is, best, used, as, an, approach, when, each, brand, in, intended, for, a, different, market, segment, multibranding, is, used, in, an, assortment, of, ways, with, selected, companies, grouping, their, brands, based, on, price, quality, segments, individual, brand, names, naturally, allow, greater, flexibility, by, permitting, a, variety, of, different, products, of, differing, quality, to, be, sold, without, confusing, the, consumer, s, perception, of, what, business, the, company, is, in, or, diluting, higher, quality, products, procter, gamble, a, multinational, consumer, goods, company, that, offers, over, 100, brands, each, suited, for, different, consumer, needs, for, instance, head, shoulders, that, helps, consumers, relieve, dandruff, in, the, form, of, a, shampoo, oral, b, which, offers, inter, dental, products, vicks, which, offers, cough, and, cold, products, and, downy, which, offers, dryer, sheets, and, fabric, softeners, other, examples, include, coca, cola, nestl, kellogg, s, and, mars, this, approach, usually, results, in, higher, promotion, costs, and, advertising, this, is, due, to, the, company, being, required, to, generate, awareness, among, consumers, and, retailers, for, each, new, brand, name, without, the, benefit, of, any, previous, impressions, multibranding, strategy, has, many, advantages, there, is, no, risk, that, a, product, failure, will, affect, other, products, in, the, line, as, each, brand, is, unique, to, each, market, segment, although, certain, large, multiband, companies, have, come, across, that, the, cost, and, difficulty, of, implementing, a, multibranding, strategy, can, overshadow, the, benefits, for, example, unilever, the, world, s, third, largest, multination, consumer, goods, company, recently, streamlined, its, brands, from, over, 400, brands, to, center, their, attention, onto, 14, brands, with, sales, of, over, 1, billion, euros, unilever, accomplished, this, through, product, deletion, and, sales, to, other, companies, other, multibrand, companies, introduce, new, product, brands, as, a, protective, measure, to, respond, to, competition, called, fighting, brands, or, fighter, brands, cannibalization, is, a, particular, challenge, with, a, multi, brand, strategy, approach, in, which, the, new, brand, takes, business, away, from, an, established, one, which, the, organization, also, owns, this, may, be, acceptable, indeed, to, be, expected, if, there, is, a, net, gain, overall, alternatively, it, may, be, the, price, the, organization, is, willing, to, pay, for, shifting, its, position, in, the, market, the, new, product, being, one, stage, in, this, process, the, main, purpose, of, fighting, brands, is, to, challenge, competitor, brands, for, example, qantas, australia, s, largest, flag, carrier, airline, introduced, jetstar, to, go, head, to, head, against, the, low, cost, carrier, virgin, australia, formerly, known, as, virgin, blue, jetstar, is, an, australian, low, cost, airline, for, budget, conscious, travellers, but, it, receives, many, negative, reviews, due, to, this, the, launching, of, jetstar, allowed, qantas, to, rival, virgin, australia, without, the, criticism, being, affiliated, with, qantas, because, of, the, distinct, brand, name, private, branding, also, known, as, reseller, branding, private, labelling, store, brands, or, own, brands, have, increased, in, popularity, private, branding, is, when, a, company, manufactures, products, but, it, is, sold, under, the, brand, name, of, a, wholesaler, or, retailer, private, branding, is, popular, because, it, typically, produces, high, profits, for, manufacturers, and, resellers, the, pricing, of, private, brand, product, are, usually, cheaper, compared, to, competing, name, brands, consumers, are, commonly, deterred, by, these, prices, in, good, economic, circumstances, as, it, sets, a, perception, of, lower, quality, and, standard, but, this, view, shifts, in, less, ideal, economic, circumstances, in, australia, their, leading, supermarket, chains, both, woolworths, and, coles, are, saturated, with, store, brands, or, private, labels, for, example, in, the, united, states, paragon, trade, brands, ralcorp, holdings, and, rayovac, are, major, suppliers, of, diapers, grocery, products, and, private, label, alkaline, batteries, correspondingly, costco, walmart, radioshack, sears, and, kroger, are, large, retailers, that, have, their, own, brand, names, similarly, macy, s, a, mid, range, chain, of, department, stores, offers, a, wide, catalogue, of, private, brands, exclusive, to, their, stores, from, brands, such, as, first, impressions, which, supply, newborn, and, infant, clothing, hotel, collection, which, supply, luxury, linens, and, mattresses, and, tasso, elba, which, supply, european, inspired, menswear, they, use, private, branding, strategy, to, specifically, target, consumer, markets, mixed, branding, strategy, is, where, a, firm, markets, products, under, its, own, name, s, and, that, of, a, reseller, because, the, segment, attracted, to, the, reseller, is, different, from, its, own, market, for, example, elizabeth, arden, inc, a, major, american, cosmetics, and, fragrance, company, uses, mixed, branding, strategy, the, company, sells, its, elizabeth, arden, brand, through, department, stores, and, line, of, skin, care, products, at, walmart, with, the, skin, simple, brand, name, companies, such, as, whirlpool, del, monte, and, dial, produce, private, brands, of, home, appliances, pet, foods, and, soap, correspondingly, other, examples, of, mixed, branding, strategy, include, michelin, epson, microsoft, gillette, and, toyota, michelin, one, of, the, largest, tire, manufacturers, allowed, sears, an, american, retail, chain, to, place, their, brand, name, on, the, tires, microsoft, a, multinational, technology, company, is, seriously, regarded, as, a, corporate, technology, brand, but, it, sells, its, versatile, home, entertainment, hub, under, the, brand, xbox, to, better, align, with, the, new, and, crazy, identity, gillette, catered, to, females, with, gillette, for, women, which, has, now, become, known, as, venus, the, launch, of, venus, was, conducted, in, order, to, fulfil, the, feminine, market, of, the, previously, dominating, masculine, razor, industry, similarly, toyota, an, automobile, manufacturer, used, mixed, branding, in, the, u, s, toyota, was, regarded, as, a, valuable, car, brand, being, economical, family, orientated, and, known, as, a, vehicle, that, rarely, broke, down, but, toyota, sought, out, to, fulfil, a, higher, end, expensive, market, segment, thus, they, created, lexus, the, luxury, vehicle, division, of, premium, cars, attitude, branding, is, the, choice, to, represent, a, larger, feeling, which, is, not, necessarily, connected, with, the, product, or, consumption, of, the, product, at, all, marketing, labeled, as, attitude, branding, include, that, of, nike, starbucks, the, body, shop, safeway, and, apple, in, the, 1999, book, no, logo, naomi, klein, describes, attitude, branding, as, a, fetish, strategy, schaefer, and, kuehlwein, analyzed, brands, such, as, apple, ben, jerry, s, or, chanel, describing, them, as, ueber, brands, brands, that, are, able, to, gain, and, retain, meaning, beyond, the, material, a, great, brand, raises, the, bar, it, adds, a, greater, sense, of, purpose, to, the, experience, whether, it, s, the, challenge, to, do, your, best, in, sports, and, fitness, or, the, affirmation, that, the, cup, of, coffee, you, re, drinking, really, matters, howard, schultz, president, ceo, and, chairman, of, starbucks, iconic, brands, are, defined, as, having, aspects, that, contribute, to, consumer, s, self, expression, and, personal, identity, brands, whose, value, to, consumers, comes, primarily, from, having, identity, value, are, said, to, be, identity, brands, some, of, these, brands, have, such, a, strong, identity, that, they, become, more, or, less, cultural, icons, which, makes, them, iconic, brands, examples, are, apple, nike, and, harley, davidson, many, iconic, brands, include, almost, ritual, like, behaviour, in, purchasing, or, consuming, the, products, there, are, four, key, elements, to, creating, iconic, brands, holt, 2004, schaefer, and, kuehlwein, propose, the, following, ueber, branding, principles, they, derived, them, from, studying, successful, modern, prestige, brands, and, what, elevates, them, above, mass, competitors, and, beyond, considerations, of, performance, and, price, alone, in, the, minds, of, consumers, recently, a, number, of, companies, have, successfully, pursued, no, brand, strategies, by, creating, packaging, that, imitates, generic, brand, simplicity, examples, include, the, japanese, company, muji, which, means, no, label, in, english, from, mujirushi, ryohin, literally, no, brand, quality, goods, and, the, florida, company, no, ad, sunscreen, although, there, is, a, distinct, muji, brand, muji, products, are, not, branded, this, no, brand, strategy, means, that, little, is, spent, on, advertisement, or, classical, marketing, and, muji, s, success, is, attributed, to, the, word, of, mouth, simple, shopping, experience, and, the, anti, brand, movement, no, brand, branding, may, be, construed, as, a, type, of, branding, as, the, product, is, made, conspicuous, through, the, absence, of, a, brand, name, tapa, amarilla, or, yellow, cap, in, venezuela, during, the, 1980s, is, another, good, example, of, no, brand, strategy, it, was, simply, recognized, by, the, color, of, the, cap, of, this, cleaning, products, company, in, this, case, the, supplier, of, a, key, component, used, by, a, number, of, suppliers, of, the, end, product, may, wish, to, guarantee, its, own, position, by, promoting, that, component, as, a, brand, in, its, own, right, the, most, frequently, quoted, example, is, intel, which, positions, itself, in, the, pc, market, with, the, slogan, and, sticker, intel, inside, in, the, better, mousetrap, brand, invention, in, a, media, democracy, 2012, author, and, brand, strategist, simon, pont, posits, that, social, media, brands, may, be, the, most, evolved, version, of, the, brand, form, because, they, focus, not, on, themselves, but, on, their, users, in, so, doing, social, media, brands, are, arguably, more, charismatic, in, that, consumers, are, compelled, to, spend, time, with, them, because, the, time, spent, is, in, the, meeting, of, fundamental, human, drivers, related, to, belonging, and, individualism, we, wear, our, physical, brands, like, badges, to, help, define, us, but, we, use, our, digital, brands, to, help, express, who, we, are, they, allow, us, to, be, to, hold, a, mirror, up, to, ourselves, and, it, is, clear, we, like, what, we, see, private, label, brands, also, called, own, brands, or, store, brands, have, become, popular, where, the, retailer, has, a, particularly, strong, identity, such, as, marks, spencer, in, the, uk, clothing, sector, this, own, brand, may, be, able, to, compete, against, even, the, strongest, brand, leaders, and, may, outperform, those, products, that, are, not, otherwise, strongly, branded, designer, private, labels, a, relatively, recent, innovation, in, retailing, is, the, introduction, of, designer, private, labels, designer, private, labels, involve, a, collaborative, contract, between, a, well, known, fashion, designer, and, a, retailer, both, retailer, and, designer, collaborate, to, design, goods, with, popular, appeal, pitched, at, price, points, that, fit, the, consumer, s, budget, for, retail, outlets, these, types, of, collaborations, give, them, greater, control, over, the, design, process, as, well, as, access, to, exclusive, store, brands, that, can, potentially, drive, store, traffic, in, australia, for, example, the, department, store, myer, now, offers, a, range, of, exclusive, designer, private, labels, including, jayson, brundson, karen, walker, leona, edmiston, wayne, cooper, fleur, wood, and, l, for, lisa, ho, another, up, market, department, store, david,

wildlife, fund, and, aiesec, are, among, the, most, recognized, brands, around, the, world, ngos, and, non, profit, organizations, moved, beyond, using, their, brands, for, fundraising, to, express, their, internal, identity, and, to, clarify, their, social, goals, and, long, term, aims, organizational, brands, have, well, determined, brand, guidelines, and, logo, variables, these, are, brands, that, are, created, by, the, public, for, the, business, which, is, opposite, to, the, traditional, method, where, the, business, creates, a, brand, many, businesses, have, started, to, use, elements, of, personalization, in, their, branding, strategies, offering, the, client, or, consumer, the, ability, to, choose, from, various, brand, options, or, have, direct, control, over, the, brand, examples, of, this, include, the, shareacoke, campaign, by, coca, cola, which, printed, people, s, names, and, place, names, on, their, bottles, encouraging, people, airbnb, has, created, the, facility, for, users, to, create, their, own, symbol, for, the, software, to, replace, the, brand, s, mark, known, as, the, b, lo, nation, branding, is, a, field, of, theory, and, practice, which, aims, to, measure, build, and, manage, the, reputation, of, countries, closely, related, to, place, branding, some, approaches, applied, such, as, an, increasing, importance, on, the, symbolic, value, of, products, have, led, countries, to, emphasize, their, distinctive, characteristics, the, branding, and, image, of, a, nation, state, and, the, successful, transference, of, this, image, to, its, exports, is, just, as, important, as, what, they, actually, produce, and, sell, destination, branding, is, the, work, of, cities, states, and, other, localities, to, promote, the, location, to, tourists, and, drive, additional, revenues, into, a, tax, base, these, activities, are, often, undertaken, by, governments, but, can, also, result, from, the, work, of, community, associations, the, destination, marketing, association, international, is, the, industry, leading, organization, intellectual, property, infringements, in, particular, counterfeiting, can, affect, consumer, trust, and, ultimately, damage, brand, equity, brand, protection, is, the, set, of, preventive, monitoring, and, reactive, measures, taken, by, brand, owners, to, eliminate, reduce, or, mitigate, these,

express, criticism, of, a, brand, and, its, perceived, values, through, a, form, of, parody, and, are, typically, unflattering, in, nature, due, to, the, ability, of, doppelg, nger, brands, to,
