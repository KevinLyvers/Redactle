over, the, last, few, decades, airbus, prominently, illustrated, the, european, airliner, manufacturing, consolidation, in, the, late, 1960s, between, 1988, and, 2010, more, than, 5, 452, mergers, and, acquisitions, with, a, total, known, value, of, us, 579, billion, were, announced, worldwide, in, 1993, then, united, states, secretary, of, defense, les, aspin, and, his, deputy, william, j,

billion, in, 1996, raytheon, acquired, hughes, aircraft, company, for, 9, 5, billion, in, 1997, bae, systems, is, the, successor, company, to, numerous, british, aircraft, manufacturers, which, merged, throughout, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, many, of, these, mergers, followed, the, 1957, defence, white, paper, marconi, electronic, systems, a, subsidiary, of, the, general, electric, company, plc, was, acquired, by, british, aerospace, for, us, 12, 3, billion, in, 1999, merger, to, form, bae, systems, in, 2002, when, fairchild, dornier, was, bankrupt, airbus, boeing, or, bombardier, declined, to, take, the, 728jet, 928jet, large, regional, jet, program, as, mainline, and, regional, aircraft, manufacturers, were, split, and, airbus, was, digesting, its, ill, fated, fokker, acquisition, a, decade, earlier, on, september, 4, 2017, united, technologies, acquired, rockwell, collins, in, cash, and, stock, for, 23, billion, 30, billion, including, rockwell, collins, net, debt, for, 500, million, of, synergies, expected, by, year, four, the, oct, 16, 2017, announcement, of, the, cseries, partnership, between, airbus, and, bombardier, aerospace, could, trigger, a, daisy, chain, of, reactions, towards, a, new, order, airbus, gets, a, new, efficient, model, at, the, lower, end, of, the, narrowbody, market, which, provides, the, bulk, of, airliner, profits, and, can, abandon, the, slow, selling, a319, while, bombardier, benefits, from, the, growth, in, this, expanded, market, even, if, it, holds, a, smaller, residual, stake, boeing, could, forge, a, similar, alliance, with, either, embraer, with, its, e, jet, e2, or, mitsubishi, heavy, industries, and, its, mrj, on, 21, december, boeing, and, embraer, confirmed, to, be, discussing, a, potential, combination, with, a, transaction, subject, to, brazilian, government, regulators, the, companies, boards, and, shareholders, approvals, the, weight, of, airbus, and, boeing, could, help, e2, and, cseries, sales, but, the, 100, 150, seats, market, seems, slow, as, the, cseries, renamed, a220, and, e, jet, e2, are, more, capable, than, their, predecessors, they, moved, closer, to, the, lower, end, of, the, narrowbodies, in, 2018, the, four, western, airframers, combined, into, two, within, nine, months, as, boeing, acquired, 80, of, embraer, s, airliners, for, 3, 8, billion, on, july, 5, on, april, 3, 2020, raytheon, and, united, technologies, corporation, except, otis, worldwide, leaving, rockwell, collins, and, engine, maker, pratt, and, whitney, merged, to, form, raytheon, technologies, corporation, with, combined, sales, of, 79, billion, in, 2019, the, most, prominent, unions, between, 1995, and, 2020, include, those, of, boeing, and, mcdonnell, douglas, the, french, german, and, spanish, parts, of, eads, and, united, technologies, with, rockwell, collins, then, raytheon, but, many, mergers, projects, did, not, went, through, textron, bombardier, eads, bae,

northrop, grumman, the, largest, aerospace, suppliers, are, united, technologies, with, 28, 2, billion, of, revenue, followed, by, ge, aviation, with, 24, 7, billion, safran, with, 22, 5, billion, rolls, royce, holdings, with, 16, 9, billion, honeywell, aerospace, with, 15, 2, billion, and, rockwell, collins, including, b, e, aerospace, with, 8, 1, billion, electric, aircraft, development, could, generate, large, changes, for, the, aerospace, suppliers, on, 26, november, 2018, united, technologies, announced, the, completion, of, its, rockwell, collins, acquisition, renaming, systems, supplier, utc, aerospace, systems, as, collins, aerospace, for, 23, billion, of, sales, in, 2017, and, 70, 000, employees, and, 39, 0, billion, of, sales, in, 2017, combined, with, engine, manufacturer, pratt, whitney, before, the, 1980s, 1990s, aircraft, and, aeroengine, manufacturers, were, vertically, integrated, then, douglas, aircraft, outsourced, large, aerostructures, and, the, bombardier, global, express, pioneered, the, tier, 1, supply, chain, model, inspired, by, automotive, industry, with, 10, 12, risk, sharing, limited, partners, funding, around, half, of, the, development, costs, the, embraer, e, jet, followed, in, the, late, 1990s, with, fewer, than, 40, primary, suppliers, tier, 1, suppliers, were, led, by, honeywell, safran, goodrich, corporation, and, hamilton, sundstrand, in, the, 2000s, rolls, royce, reduced, its, supplier, count, after, bringing, in, automotive, supply, chain, executives, on, the, airbus, a380, less, than, 100, major, suppliers, outsource, 60, of, its, value, even, 80, on, the, a350, boeing, embraced, an, aggressive, tier, 1, model, for, the, 787, but, with, its, difficulties, began, to, question, why, it, was, earning, lower, margins, than, its, suppliers, while, it, seemed, to, take, all, the, risk, ensuing, its, 2011, partnering, for, success, initiative, as, airbus, initiated, its, own, scope, initiative, for, the, a320, tier, 1, consolidation, also, affects, engine, manufacturers, ge, aerospace, acquired, avio, in, 2013, and, rolls, royce, took, control, of, itp, aero
