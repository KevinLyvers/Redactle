kx, a, language, families, and, can, be, defined, as, a, people, only, in, contrast, to, neighboring, pastoralists, such, as, the, khoekhoe, and, descendants, of, more, recent, waves, of, immigration, such, as, the, bantu, europeans, and, asians, in, 2017, botswana, was, home, to, approximately, 63, 500, san, making, it, the, country, with, the, highest, proportion, of, san, people, at, 2, 8, in, khoekhoegowab, the, term, san, has, a, long, vowel, and, is, spelled, s, n, it, is, an, exonym, meaning, foragers, and, is, used, in, a, derogatory, manner, to, describe, people, too, poor, to, have, cattle, based, on, observation, of, lifestyle, this, term, has, been, applied, to, speakers, of, three, distinct, language, families, living, between, the, okavango, river, in, botswana, and, etosha, national, park, in, northwestern, namibia, extending, up, into, southern, angola, central, peoples, of, most, of, namibia, and, botswana, extending, into, zambia, and, zimbabwe, and, the, southern, people, in, the, central, kalahari, towards, the, molopo, river, who, are, the, last, remnant, of, the, previously, extensive, indigenous, peoples, of, southern, africa, the, designations, bushmen, and, san, are, both, exonyms, the, san, have, no, collective, word, for, themselves, in, their, own, languages, san, comes, from, a, derogatory, khoekhoe, word, used, to, refer, to, foragers, without, cattle, or, other, wealth, from, a, root, saa, picking, up, from, the, ground, plural, n, in, the, hai, om, dialect, bushmen, is, the, older, cover, term, but, san, was, widely, adopted, in, the, west, by, the, late, 1990s, the, term, bushmen, from, 17th, century, dutch, bosjesmans, is, still, used, by, others, and, to, self, identify, but, is, now, considered, pejorative, or, derogatory, by, many, south, africans, in, 2008, the, use, of, boesman, the, modern, afrikaans, equivalent, of, bushman, in, the, die, burger, newspaper, was, brought, before, the, equality, court, the, san, council, testified, that, it, had, no, objection, to, its, use, in, a, positive, context, and, the, court, ruled, that, the, use, of, the, term, was, not, derogatory, the, san, refer, to, themselves, as,

gwi, etc, representatives, of, san, peoples, in, 2003, stated, their, preference, for, the, use, of, such, individual, group, names, where, possible, over, the, use, of, the, collective, term, san, adoption, of, the, khoekhoe, term, san, in, western, anthropology, dates, to, the, 1970s, and, this, remains, the, standard, term, in, english, language, ethnographic, literature, although, some, authors, later, switched, back, to, using, the, name, bushmen, the, compound, khoisan, is, used, to, refer, to, the, pastoralist, khoi, and, the, foraging, san, collectively, it, was, coined, by, leonhard, schulze, in, the, 1920s, and, popularized, by, isaac, schapera, in, 1930, anthropological, use, of, san, was, detached, from, the, compound, khoisan, as, it, has, been, reported, that, the, exonym, san, is, perceived, as, a, pejorative, in, parts, of, the, central, kalahari, by, the, late, 1990s, the, term, san, was, used, generally, by, the, people, themselves, the, adoption, of, the, term, was, preceded, by, a, number, of, meetings, held, in, the, 1990s, where, delegates, debated, on, the, adoption, of, a, collective, term, these, meetings, included, the, common, access, to, development, conference, organized, by, the, government, of, botswana, held, in, gaborone, in, 1993, the, 1996, inaugural, annual, general, meeting, of, the, working, group, of, indigenous, minorities, in, southern, africa, wimsa, held, in, namibia, and, a, 1997, conference, in, cape, town, on, khoisan, identities, and, cultural, heritage, organized, by, the, university, of, the, western, cape, the, term, san, is, now, standard, in, south, african, and, used, officially, in, the, blazon, of, the, national, coat, of, arms, the, south, african, san, council, representing, san,

south, africa, the, historical, presence, of, the, san, in, botswana, is, particularly, evident, in, northern, botswana, s, tsodilo, hills, region, san, were, traditionally, semi, nomadic, moving, seasonally, within, certain, defined, areas, based, on, the, availability, of, resources, such, as, water, game, animals, and, edible, plants, peoples, related, to, or, similar, to, the, san, occupied, the, southern, shores, throughout, the, eastern, shrubland, and, may, have, formed, a, sangoan, continuum, from, the, red, sea, to, the, cape, of, good, hope, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, after, the, arrival, of, the, dutch, thousands, of, san, had, been, killed, and, forced, to, work, for, the, colonists, the, british, tried, to, civilize, the, san, and, make, them, adopt, a, more, agricultural, lifestyle, but, were, not, successful, by, the, 1870s, the, last, san, of, the, cape, were, hunted, to, extinction, while, other, san, were, able, to, survive, the, south, african, government, used, to, issue, licenses, for, people, to, hunt, the, san, with, the, last, one, being, reportedly, issued, in, namibia, in, 1936, from, the, 1950s, through, to, the, 1990s, san, communities, switched, to, farming, because, of, government, mandated, modernization, programs, despite, the, lifestyle, changes, they, have, provided, a, wealth, of, information, in, anthropology, and, genetics, one, broad, study, of, african, genetic, diversity, completed, in, 2009, found, that, the, genetic, diversity, of, the, san, was, among, the, top, five, of, all, 121, sampled, populations, certain, san, groups, are, one, of, 14, known, extant, ancestral, population, clusters, that, is, groups, of, populations, with, common, genetic, ancestry, who, share, ethnicity, and, similarities, in, both, their, culture, and, the, properties, of, their, languages, despite, some, positive, aspects, of, government, development, programs, reported, by, members, of, san, and, bakgalagadi, communities, in, botswana, many, have, spoken, of, a, consistent, sense, of, exclusion, from, government, decision, making, processes, and, many, san, and, bakgalagadi, have, alleged, experiencing, ethnic, discrimination, on, the, part, of, the, government, 8, 9, the, united, states, department, of, state, described, ongoing, discrimination, against, san, or, basarwa, people, in, botswana, in, 2013, as, the, principal, human, rights, concern, of, that, country, 1, the, san, kinship, system, reflects, their, history, as, traditionally, small, mobile, foraging, bands, san, kinship, is, similar, to, inuit, kinship, which, uses, the, same, set, of, terms, as, in, european, cultures, but, adds, a, name, rule, and, an, age, rule, for, determining, what, terms, to, use, the, age, rule, resolves, any, confusion, arising, from, kinship, terms, as, the, older, of, two, people, always, decides, what, to, call, the, younger, relatively, few, names, circulate, approximately, 35, names, per, sex, and, each, child, is, named, after, a, grandparent, or, another, relative, but, never, their, parents, children, have, no, social, duties, besides, playing, and, leisure, is, very, important, to, san, of, all, ages, large, amounts, of, time, are, spent, in, conversation, joking, music, and, sacred, dances, women, may, be, leaders, of, their, own, family, groups, they, may, also, make, important, family, and, group, decisions, and, claim, ownership, of, water, holes, and, foraging, areas, women, are, mainly, involved, in, the, gathering, of, food, but, sometimes, also, partake, in, hunting, water, is, important, in, san, life, during, long, droughts, they, make, use, of, sip, wells, in, order, to, collect, water, to, make, a, sip, well, a, san, scrapes, a, deep, hole, where, the, sand, is, damp, and, inserts, a, long, hollow, grass, stem, into, the, hole, an, empty, ostrich, egg, is, used, to, collect, the, water, water, is, sucked, into, the, straw, from, the, sand, into, the, mouth, and, then, travels, down, another, straw, into, the, ostrich, egg, traditionally, the, san, were, an, egalitarian, society, although, they, had, hereditary, chiefs, their, authority, was, limited, the, san, made, decisions, among, themselves, by, consensus, with, women, treated, as, relative, equals, in, decision, making, san, economy, was, a, gift, economy, based, on, giving, each, other, gifts, regularly, rather, than, on, trading, or, purchasing, goods, and, services, most, san, are, monogamous, but, if, a, hunter, is, able, to, obtain, enough, food, he, can, afford, to, have, a, second, wife, as, well, villages, range, in, sturdiness, from, nightly, rain, shelters, in, the, warm, spring, when, people, move, constantly, in, search, of, budding, greens, to,

receding, waters, women, gather, fruit, berries, tubers, bush, onions, and, other, plant, materials, for, the, band, s, consumption, ostrich, eggs, are, gathered, and, the, empty, shells, are, used, as, water, containers, insects, provide, perhaps, 10, of, animal, proteins, consumed, most, often, during, the, dry, season, depending, on, location, the, san, consume, 18, to, 104, species, including, grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and, termites, women, s, traditional, gathering, gear, is, simple, and, effective, a, hide, sling, a, blanket, a, cloak, called, a, kaross, to, carry, foodstuffs, firewood, smaller, bags, a, digging, stick, and, perhaps, a, smaller, version, of, the, kaross, to, carry, a, baby, men, and, presumably, women, when, they, accompany,

2012, historical, evidence, shows, that, certain, san, communities, have, always, lived, in, the, desert, regions, of, the, kalahari, however, eventually, nearly, all, other, san, communities, in, southern, africa, were, forced, into, this, region, the, kalahari, san, remained, in, poverty, where, their, richer, neighbours, denied, them, rights, to, the, land, before, long, in, both, botswana, and, namibia, they, found, their, territory, drastically, reduced, various, y, chromosome, studies, show, that, the, san, carry, some, of, the, most, divergent, earliest, branching, human, y, chromosome, haplogroups, these, haplogroups, are, specific, sub, groups, of, haplogroups, a, and, b, the, two, earliest, branches, on, the, human, y, chromosome, tree, mitochondrial, dna, studies, also, provide, evidence, that, the, san, carry, high, frequencies, of, the, earliest, haplogroup, branches, in, the, human, mitochondrial, dna, tree, this, dna, is, inherited, only, from, one, s, mother, the, most, divergent, earliest, branching, mitochondrial, haplogroup, l0d, has, been, identified, at, its, highest, frequencies, in, the, southern, african, san, groups, in, a, study, published, in, march, 2011, brenna, henn, and, colleagues, found, that, the, khomani, san, as, well, as, the, sandawe, and, hadza, peoples, of, tanzania, were, the, most, genetically, diverse, of, any, living, humans, studied, this, high, degree, of, genetic, diversity, hints, at, the, origin, of, anatomically, modern, humans, a, 2008, study, suggested, that, the, san, may, have, been, isolated, from, other, original, ancestral, groups, for, as, much, as, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, years, and, later, rejoined, re, integrating, into, the, rest, of, the, human, gene, pool, a, dna, study, of, fully, sequenced, genomes, published, in, september, 2016, showed, that, the, ancestors, of, today, s, san, hunter, gatherers, began, to, diverge, from, other, human, populations, in, africa, about, 200, 000, years, ago, and, were, fully, isolated, by, 100, 000, years, ago, according, to, professors, robert, k, hitchcock, wayne, a, babchuk, in, 1652, when, europeans, established, a, full, time, presence, in, southern, africa, there, were, some, 300, 000, san, and, 600, 000, khoekhoe, in, southern, africa, during, the, early, phases, of, european, colonization, tens, of, thousands, of, khoekhoe, and, san, peoples, lost, their, lives, as, a, result, of, genocide, murder, physical, mistreatment, and, disease, there, were, cases, of, bushman, hunting, in, which, commandos, mobile, paramilitary, units, or, posses, sought, to, dispatch, san, and, khoekhoe, in, various, parts, of, southern, africa, much, aboriginal, people, s, land, in, botswana, including, land, occupied, by, the, san, people, or, basarwa, was, conquered, during, colonization, loss, of, land, and, access, to, natural, resources, continued, after, botswana, s, independence, 2, the, san, have, been, particularly, affected, by, encroachment, by, majority, peoples, and, non, indigenous, farmers, onto, their, traditional, land, government, policies, from, the, 1970s, transferred, a, significant, area, of, traditionally, san, land, to, majority, agro, pastoralist, tribes, and, white, settlers, 15, much, of, the, government, s, policy, regarding, land, tended, to, favor, the, dominant, tswana, peoples, over, the, minority, san, and, bakgalagadi, 2, loss, of, land, is, a, major, contributor, to, the, problems, facing, botswana, s, indigenous, people, including, especially, the, san, s, eviction, from, the, central, kalahari, game, reserve, 2, the, government, of, botswana, decided, to, relocate, all, of, those, living, within, the, reserve, to, settlements, outside, it, harassment, of, residents, dismantling, of, infrastructure, and, bans, on, hunting, appear, to, have, been, used, to, induce, residents, to, leave, 16, the, government, has, denied, that, any, of, the, relocation, was, forced, a, legal, battle, followed, the, relocation, policy, may, have, been, intended, to, facilitate, diamond, mining, by, gem, diamonds, within, the, reserve, 18, hoodia, gordonii,

granted, to, phytopharm, for, development, of, the, active, ingredient, in, the, hoodia, plant, p57, glycoside, to, be, used, as, a, pharmaceutical, drug, for, dieting, once, this, patent, was, brought, to, the, attention, of, the, san, a, benefit, sharing, agreement, was, reached, between, them, and, the, csir, in, 2003, this, would, award, royalties, to, the, san, for, the, benefits, of, their, indigenous, knowledge, during, the, case, the, san, people, were, represented, and, assisted, by, the, working, group, of, indigenous, minorities, in, southern, africa, wimsa, the, south, african, san, council, and, the, south, african, san, institute, this, benefit, sharing, agreement, is, one, of, the, first, to, give, royalties, to, the, holders, of, traditional, knowledge, used, for, drug, sales, the, terms, of, the, agreement, are, contentious, because, of, their, apparent, lack, of, adherence, to, the, bonn, guidelines, on, access, to, genetic, resources, and, benefit, sharing, as, outlined, in, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, cbd, the, san, have, yet, to, profit, from, this, agreement, as, p57, has, still, not, yet, been, legally, developed, and,

in, south, africa, and, had, a, respectful, lifelong, fascination, with, native, african, cultures, in, 1955, he, was, commissioned, by, the, bbc, to, go, to, the, kalahari, desert, with, a, film, crew, in, search, of, the, san, the, filmed, material, was, turned, into, a, very, popular, six, part, television, documentary, a, year, later, driven, by, a, lifelong, fascination, with, this, vanished, tribe, van, der, post, published, a, 1958, book, about, this, expedition, entitled, the, lost, world, of, the, kalahari, it, was, to, be, his, most, famous, book, in, 1961, he, published, the, heart, of, the, hunter, a, narrative, which, he, admits, in, the, introduction, uses, two, previous, works, of, stories, and, mythology, as, a, sort, of, stone, age, bible, namely, specimens, of, bushman, folklore, 1911, collected, by, wilhelm, h, i, bleek, and, lucy, c, lloyd, and, dorothea, bleek, s, mantis, and, his, friend, van, der, post, s, work, brought, indigenous, african, cultures, to, millions, of, people, around, the, world, for, the, first, time, but, some, people, disparaged, it, as, part, of, the, subjective, view, of, a, european, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, stating, that, he, branded, the, san, as, simple, children, of, nature, or, even, mystical, ecologists, in, 1992, by, john, perrot, and, team, published, the, book, bush, for, the, bushman, a, desperate, plea, on,
