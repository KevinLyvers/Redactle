the, muddy, slow, unpaved, roads, common, in, japan, at, the, time, the, project, had, been, championed, for, many, years, by, founder, kiichiro, toyoda, who, died, suddenly, on, march, 27, 1952, the,

in, japan, but, ultimately, production, was, cut, back, to, 100, cars, for, special, fleet, use, in, japan, and, the, u, s, only, in, late, 2012, toyota, announced, that, it, would, back, away, from, fully, electric, vehicles, after, producing, less, than, 5, 000, at, the, time, the, company, s, vice, chairman, takeshi, uchiyamada, said, the, current, capabilities, of, electric, vehicles, do, not, meet, society, s, needs, whether, it, may, be, the, distance, the, cars, can, run, or, the, costs, or, how, it, takes, a, long, time, to, charge, a, shift, in, toyota, s, formerly, battery, agnostic, posture, could, be, seen, as, early, as, 2016, when, toyota, s, cfo, takahiko, ijichi, sent, a, strong, signal, that, toyota, soon, plans, to, jump, on, the, battery, bandwagon, and, make, electric, cars, despite, expressing, skeptical, views, about, their, range, and, charging, times, as, the, wall, street, journal, wrote, toyota, said, it, would, make, and, sell, battery, electric, vehicles,
