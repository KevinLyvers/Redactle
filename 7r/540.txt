a, lawyer, is, a, person, who, is, qualified, to, offer, advice, about, the, law, draft, legal, documents, or, represent, individuals, in, legal, matters, the, exact, nature, of, a, lawyer, s, work, varies, depending, on, the, legal, jurisdiction, and, the, legal, system, as, well, as, the, lawyer, s, area, of, practice, in, many, jurisdictions, the, legal, profession, is, divided, into, various, branches, including, barristers, solicitors, conveyancers, notaries, canon, lawyer, who, perform, different, tasks, related, to, the, law, historically, the, role, of, lawyers, can, be, traced, back, to, ancient, civilizations, such, as, greece, and, rome, in, modern, times, the, practice, of, law, includes, activities, such, as, representing, clients, in, criminal, or, civil, court, advising, on, business, transactions, protecting, intellectual, property, and, ensuring, compliance, with, laws, and, regulations, depending, on, the, country, the, education, required, to, become, a, lawyer, can, range, from, completing, an, undergraduate, law, degree, to, undergoing, postgraduate, education, and, professional, training, in, many, jurisdictions, passing, a, bar, examination, is, also, necessary, before, one, can, practice, law, working, as, a, lawyer, generally, involves, the, practical, application, of, abstract, legal, theories, and, knowledge, to, solve, specific, problems, some, lawyers, also, work, primarily, in, upholding, the, rule, of, law, human, rights, and, the, interests, of, the, legal, profession, some, jurisdictions, have, multiple, types, of, lawyers, while, others, only, have, one, or, two, england, the, mother, of, the, common, law, jurisdictions, emerged, from, the, middle, ages, with, a, complexity, in, its, legal, professions, similar, to, that, of, civil, law, jurisdictions, but, then, evolved, by, the, 19th, century, to, a, single, division, between, barristers, and, solicitors, several, countries, that, originally, had, two, or, more, legal, professions, have, since, fused, or, united, their, professions, into, a, single, type, of, lawyer, most, countries, in, this, category, are, common, law, countries, though, france, a, civil, law, country, merged, its, jurists, in, 1990, and, 1991, in, response, to, anglo, american, competition, in, countries, with, fused, professions, a, lawyer, is, usually, permitted, to, carry, out, all, or, nearly, all, the, responsibilities, listed, below, in, some, jurisdictions, descended, from, the, english, common, law, tradition, including, england, and, wales, there, are, often, two, kinds, of, lawyers, a, barrister, also, known, as, an, advocate, or, counselor, is, a, lawyer, who, typically, specializes, in, arguing, before, courts, particularly, in, higher, courts, a, solicitor, or, attorney, is, a, lawyer, who, prepares, cases, and, gives, advice, on, legal, subjects, in, some, jurisdictions, solicitors, also, represent, people, in, court, fused, professions, where, lawyers, have, rights, of, both, barristers, and, solicitors, have, emerged, in, other, former, english, common, law, jurisdictions, such, as, the, united, states, india, and, pakistan, on, the, other, hand, civil, law, jurisdictions, do, not, have, lawyers, in, terms, of, a, single, general, purpose, legal, services, provider, rather, their, legal, professions, consist, of, a, large, number, of, different, kinds, of, legally, trained, persons, known, as, jurists, some, of, whom, are, advocates, who, are, licensed, to, practice, in, the, courts, in, some, civil, law, countries, a, similar, distinction, to, the, common, law, tradition, exists, between, advocates, and, procurators, because, each, country, has, traditionally, had, its, own, method, of, dividing, up, legal, work, among, its, legal, professionals, it, has, been, difficult, to, formulate, accurate, generalizations, that, cover, all, the, countries, with, multiple, legal, professions, other, kinds, of, legal, practitioners, include, while, some, jurisdictions, regulate, the, use, of, the, title, lawyer, others, do, not, historically, lawyers, in, most, european, countries, were, addressed, with, the, title, of, doctor, the, first, university, degrees, starting, with, the, law, school, of, the, university, of, bologna, in, the, 11th, century, were, all, law, degrees, and, doctorates, therefore, in, many, southern, european, countries, including, portugal, italy, and, malta, lawyers, have, traditionally, been, addressed, as, doctor, a, practice, which, was, transferred, to, many, countries, in, south, america, and, macau, in, some, jurisdictions, the, term, doctor, has, since, fallen, into, disuse, but, it, is, still, in, use, in, many, countries, within, and, outside, of, europe, the, title, of, doctor, has, traditionally, not, been, used, to, address, lawyers, in, england, or, other, common, law, countries, until, 1846, lawyers, in, england, were, trained, by, apprenticeship, or, in, the, inns, of, court, with, no, undergraduate, degree, being, required, although, the, most, common, law, degree, in, the, united, states, is, the, juris, doctor, most, j, d, holders, in, the, united, states, do, not, use, the, title, doctor, it, is, however, common, for, lawyers, in, the, united, states, to, use, the, honorific, suffix, esq, for, esquire, in, french, france, quebec, belgium, luxembourg, french, speaking, area, of, switzerland, and, dutch, speaking, countries, netherlands, belgium, legal, professionals, are, addressed, as, ma, tre, abbreviated, to, m, e, in, french, or, meester, abbreviated, to, mr, in, dutch, in, poland, the, title, mecenas, is, used, to, refer, to, advocates, and, attorneys, at, law, although, as, an, informal, title, its, status, is, not, protected, by, law, in, south, africa, and, india, lawyers, who, have, been, admitted, to, the, bar, may, use, the, title, advocate, abbreviated, to, adv, in, written, correspondence, lawyers, who, have, completed, two, years, of, clerkship, with, a, principal, attorney, and, passed, all, four, board, exams, may, be, admitted, as, an, attorney, likewise, italian, law, graduates, who, have, qualified, for, the, bar, use, the, title, avvocato, abbreviated, in, avv, some, lawyers, particularly, barristers, and, advocates, argue, the, legal, cases, of, clients, case, before, a, judge, or, jury, in, a, court, of, law, in, some, jurisdictions, there, are, specialist, lawyers, who, have, exclusive, rights, of, audience, before, a, court, in, others, particularly, fused, legal, jurisdictions, there, are, lawyers, who, specialize, in, courtroom, advocacy, but, who, do, not, have, a, legal, monopoly, over, the, profession, in, some, countries, litigants, have, the, option, of, arguing, on, their, own, behalf, in, other, countries, like, venezuela, no, one, may, appear, before, a, judge, unless, represented, by, a, lawyer, the, advantage, of, the, latter, regime, is, that, lawyers, are, familiar, with, the, court, s, customs, and, procedures, making, the, legal, system, more, efficient, for, all, involved, unrepresented, parties, often, damage, their, own, credibility, or, slow, the, court, down, as, a, result, of, their, inexperience, often, lawyers, brief, a, court, in, writing, on, the, issues, in, a, case, before, the, issues, can, be, orally, argued, they, may, have, to, perform, extensive, research, into, relevant, facts, also, they, draft, legal, papers, and, prepare, for, an, oral, argument, in, split, common, law, jurisdictions, the, usual, division, of, labor, is, that, a, solicitor, will, obtain, the, facts, of, the, case, from, the, client, and, then, brief, a, barrister, usually, in, writing, the, barrister, then, researches, and, drafts, the, necessary, court, pleadings, which, will, be, filed, and, served, by, the, solicitor, and, orally, argues, the, case, in, spanish, civil, law, the, procurator, merely, signs, and, presents, the, papers, to, the, court, but, it, is, the, advocate, who, drafts, the, papers, and, argues, the, case, in, other, civil, law, jurisdictions, like, japan, a, scrivener, or, clerk, may, fill, out, court, forms, and, draft, simple, papers, for, laypersons, who, cannot, afford, or, do, not, need, attorneys, and, advise, them, on, how, to, manage, and, argue, their, own, cases, in, most, developed, countries, the, legislature, has, granted, original, jurisdiction, over, highly, technical, matters, to, executive, branch, administrative, agencies, which, oversee, such, things, as, a, result, some, lawyers, have, become, specialists, in, administrative, law, in, a, few, countries, there, is, a, special, category, of, jurists, with, a, monopoly, over, this, form, of, advocacy, for, example, france, formerly, had, conseils, juridiques, who, were, merged, into, the, main, legal, profession, in, 1991, in, other, countries, like, the, united, states, lawyers, have, been, effectively, barred, by, statute, from, certain, types, of, administrative, hearings, in, order, to, preserve, their, informality, in, some, fused, common, law, jurisdictions, the, client, lawyer, relationship, begins, with, an, intake, interview, where, the, lawyer, gets, to, know, the, client, personally, following, which, the, lawyer, discovers, the, facts, of, the, client, s, case, clarifies, what, the, client, wants, to, accomplish, and, shapes, the, client, s, expectations, as, to, what, actually, can, be, accomplished, the, second, to, last, step, begins, to, develop, various, claims, or, defenses, for, the, client, lastly, the, lawyer, explains, her, or, his, fees, to, the, client, in, england, only, solicitors, were, traditionally, in, direct, contact, with, the, client, but, barristers, nowadays, may, apply, for, rights, to, liaise, with, clients, directly, the, solicitor, retained, a, barrister, if, one, was, necessary, and, acted, as, an, intermediary, between, the, barrister, and, the, client, in, most, cases, barristers, were, obliged, under, what, is, known, as, the, cab, rank, rule, to, accept, instructions, for, a, case, in, an, area, in, which, they, held, themselves, out, as, practicing, at, a, court, at, which, they, normally, appeared, and, at, their, usual, rates, legal, advice, is, the, application, of, abstract, principles, of, law, to, the, concrete, facts, of, the, client, s, case, to, advise, the, client, about, what, they, should, do, next, in, some, jurisdictions, only, a, properly, licensed, lawyer, may, provide, legal, advice, to, clients, for, good, consideration, even, if, no, lawsuit, is, contemplated, or, is, in, progress, in, these, jurisdictions, even, conveyancers, and, corporate, in, house, counsel, must, first, get, a, license, to, practice, though, they, may, actually, spend, very, little, of, their, careers, in, court, some, jurisdictions, have, made, the, violation, of, such, a, rule, the, crime, of, unauthorized, practice, of, law, in, other, countries, jurists, who, hold, law, degrees, are, allowed, to, provide, legal, advice, to, individuals, or, to, corporations, and, it, is, irrelevant, if, they, lack, a, license, and, cannot, appear, in, court, some, countries, go, further, in, england, and, wales, there, is, no, general, prohibition, on, the, giving, of, legal, advice, singapore, does, not, have, any, admission, requirements, for, in, house, counsel, sometimes, civil, law, notaries, are, allowed, to, give, legal, advice, as, in, belgium, in, many, countries, non, jurist, accountants, may, provide, what, is, technically, legal, advice, in, tax, and, accounting, matters, in, virtually, all, countries, patents, trademarks, industrial, designs, and, other, forms, of, intellectual, property, must, be, formally, registered, with, a, government, agency, in, order, to, receive, maximum, protection, under, the, law, the, division, of, such, work, among, lawyers, licensed, non, lawyer, jurists, agents, and, ordinary, clerks, or, scriveners, varies, greatly, from, one, country, to, the, next, the, trend, in, industrialized, countries, since, the, 1970s, has, been, to, greatly, restrict, the, role, of, clerks, and, scriveners, in, patent, and, trademark, work, and, to, require, these, functions, to, be, performed, only, by, lawyers, or, other, licensed, agents, this, ensures, that, all, work, product, in, such, cases, receives, the, full, protection, of, attorney, client, privilege, in, the, united, states, for, example, the, patent, and, trademark, office, may, not, speak, with, anyone, but, the, applicant, s, attorney, about, pending, applications, and, all, documents, filed, in, connection, with, a, pending, application, are, automatically, accorded, attorney, client, privilege, the, european, patent, office, has, a, similar, policy, in, contrast, many, countries, in, the, world, do, not, recognize, attorney, client, privilege, for, work, product, related, to, intellectual, property, or, have, only, very, limited, recognition, of, the, privilege, these, countries, include, china, japan, korea, much, of, southeast, asia, and, most, of, latin, america, as, a, result, great, care, must, be, taken, in, these, countries, to, protect, intellectual, property, as, any, work, product, related, to, a, pending, application, may, be, disclosed, to, the, public, many, companies, choose, to, file, their, applications, in, the, united, states, or, europe, first, and, then, file, for, protection, in, other, countries, where, attorney, client, privilege, is, not, recognized, this, allows, them, to, keep, their, work, product, confidential, while, they, are, still, in, the, process, of, perfecting, their, invention, or, design, in, some, countries, the, negotiating, and, drafting, of, contracts, is, considered, to, be, similar, to, the, provision, of, legal, advice, so, that, it, is, subject, to, the, licensing, requirement, explained, above, in, others, jurists, or, notaries, may, negotiate, or, draft, contracts, conveyancing, is, the, drafting, of, the, documents, necessary, for, the, transfer, of, real, property, such, as, deeds, and, mortgages, in, some, jurisdictions, all, real, estate, transactions, must, be, carried, out, by, a, lawyer, historically, conveyancing, accounted, for, about, half, of, english, solicitors, income, though, this, has, since, changed, and, a, 1978, study, showed, that, conveyancing, accounts, for, as, much, as, 80, percent, of, solicitor, client, contact, in, new, south, wales, in, most, common, law, jurisdictions, outside, of, the, united, states, this, monopoly, arose, from, an, 1804, law, that, was, introduced, by, william, pitt, the, younger, as, a, quid, pro, quo, for, the, raising, of, fees, on, the, certification, of, legal, professionals, such, as, barristers, solicitors, attorneys, and, notaries, in, others, the, use, of, a, lawyer, is, optional, and, banks, title, companies, or, realtors, may, be, used, instead, in, some, civil, law, jurisdictions, real, estate, transactions, are, handled, by, civil, law, notaries, in, england, and, wales, a, special, class, of, legal, professionals, the, licensed, conveyancer, is, also, allowed, to, carry, out, conveyancing, services, for, reward, in, many, countries, only, lawyers, have, the, legal, authority, to, draft, wills, trusts, and, any, other, documents, that, ensure, the, efficient, disposition, of, a, person, s, property, after, death, in, some, civil, law, countries, this, responsibility, is, handled, by, civil, law, notaries, in, many, civil, law, countries, prosecutors, are, trained, and, employed, as, part, of, the, judiciary, they, are, law, trained, jurists, but, may, not, necessarily, be, lawyers, in, the, sense, that, the, word, is, used, in, the, common, law, world, in, common, law, countries, prosecutors, are, usually, lawyers, holding, regular, licenses, who, work, for, the, government, office, that, files, criminal, charges, against, suspects, criminal, defense, lawyers, specialize, in, the, defense, of, those, charged, with, any, crimes, the, educational, prerequisites, for, becoming, a, lawyer, vary, greatly, across, countries, in, some, countries, law, is, an, undergraduate, degree, culminating, in, a, bachelors, or, masters, degree, in, law, in, some, of, these, jurisdictions, it, is, common, or, even, required, for, students, to, earn, another, bachelor, s, degree, at, the, same, time, where, law, is, taught, as, an, undergraduate, degree, legal, training, after, law, school, may, comprise, advanced, examinations, apprenticeships, and, additional, coursework, at, special, government, institutes, for, example, in, many, english, common, law, jurisdictions, individuals, with, a, law, degree, have, to, undergo, further, education, and, professional, training, before, qualifying, as, a, lawyer, such, as, the, bar, professional, training, course, in, other, jurisdictions, particularly, the, united, states, and, canada, law, is, taught, at, the, graduate, level, following, the, completion, of, an, unrelated, bachelors, degree, in, america, the, american, bar, association, decides, which, law, schools, to, approve, for, the, purposes, of, admission, to, the, bar, law, schools, in, the, united, states, and, canada, award, graduating, students, a, j, d, juris, doctor, as, a, professional, law, degree, in, a, handful, of, u, s, states, one, may, become, an, attorney, a, so, called, country, lawyer, by, simply, reading, law, and, passing, the, bar, examination, without, having, to, attend, law, school, first, although, very, few, people, actually, become, lawyers, that, way, the, methods, and, quality, of, legal, education, vary, widely, some, countries, require, extensive, clinical, training, in, the, form, of, apprenticeships, or, special, clinical, courses, others, like, venezuela, do, not, a, few, countries, prefer, to, teach, through, assigned, readings, of, judicial, opinions, the, casebook, method, followed, by, intense, in, class, cross, examination, by, the, professor, the, socratic, method, many, others, focus, on, theoretical, aspects, of, law, leaving, the, professional, and, practical, training, of, lawyers, to, apprenticeship, and, employment, contexts, some, countries, particularly, industrialized, ones, have, a, traditional, preference, for, full, time, law, programs, while, in, developing, countries, students, often, work, full, or, part, time, to, pay, the, tuition, and, fees, of, their, part, time, law, programs, law, schools, in, developing, countries, share, several, common, problems, such, as, an, over, reliance, on, practicing, judges, and, lawyers, who, treat, teaching, as, a, part, time, commitment, a, concomitant, scarcity, of, full, time, law, professors, incompetent, faculty, with, underqualified, credentials, and, textbooks, that, lag, behind, the, current, state, of, the, law, some, jurisdictions, grant, a, diploma, privilege, to, certain, institutions, so, that, merely, earning, a, degree, or, credential, from, those, institutions, is, the, primary, qualification, for, practicing, law, mexico, allows, anyone, with, a, law, degree, to, practice, law, however, in, a, large, number, of, countries, a, law, student, must, pass, a, bar, examination, or, a, series, of, such, examinations, before, receiving, a, license, to, practice, some, countries, require, a, formal, apprenticeship, with, an, experienced, practitioner, while, others, do, not, a, few, jurisdictions, still, allow, an, apprenticeship, in, place, of, any, kind, of, formal, legal, education, though, the, number, of, persons, who, actually, become, lawyers, that, way, is, increasingly, rare, the, career, structure, of, lawyers, varies, widely, from, one, country, to, the, next, in, most, common, law, countries, especially, those, with, fused, professions, lawyers, have, many, options, over, the, course, of, their, careers, besides, private, practice, they, can, become, a, prosecutor, government, counsel, corporate, in, house, counsel, administrative, law, judge, judge, arbitrator, or, law, professor, there, are, also, many, non, legal, jobs, for, which, legal, training, is, good, preparation, such, as, politician, corporate, executive, government, administrator, investment, banker, entrepreneur, or, journalist, in, developing, countries, like, india, a, large, majority, of, law, students, never, actually, practice, but, simply, use, their, law, degree, as, a, foundation, for, careers, in, other, fields, in, most, civil, law, countries, lawyers, generally, structure, their, legal, education, around, their, chosen, specialty, the, boundaries, between, different, types, of, lawyers, are, carefully, defined, and, hard, to, cross, after, one, earns, a, law, degree, career, mobility, may, be, severely, constrained, for, example, unlike, their, anglo, american, counterparts, it, is, difficult, for, german, judges, to, leave, the, bench, and, become, advocates, in, private, practice, another, interesting, example, is, france, where, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, all, judiciary, officials, were, graduates, of, an, elite, professional, school, for, judges, in, a, few, civil, law, countries, such, as, sweden, the, legal, profession, is, not, rigorously, bifurcated, and, everyone, within, it, can, easily, change, roles, and, arenas, in, many, countries, lawyers, are, general, practitioners, who, represent, clients, in, a, broad, field, of, legal, matters, in, others, there, has, been, a, tendency, since, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, for, lawyers, to, specialize, early, in, their, careers, in, countries, where, specialization, is, prevalent, many, lawyers, specialize, in, representing, one, side, in, one, particular, area, of, the, law, thus, it, is, common, in, the, united, states, to, hear, of, plaintiffs, personal, injury, attorneys, lawyers, in, private, practice, generally, work, in, specialized, businesses, known, as, law, firms, with, the, exception, of, english, barristers, the, vast, majority, of, law, firms, worldwide, are, small, businesses, that, range, in, size, from, 1, to, 10, lawyers, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, australia, are, exceptions, home, to, several, firms, with, more, than, 1, 000, lawyers, after, a, wave, of, mergers, in, the, late, 1990s, notably, barristers, in, england, wales, northern, ireland, and, some, states, in, australia, do, not, work, in, law, firms, those, who, offer, their, services, to, members, of, the, general, public, as, opposed, to, those, working, in, house, are, generally, self, employed, most, work, in, groupings, known, as, sets, or, chambers, where, some, administrative, and, marketing, costs, are, shared, an, important, effect, of, this, different, organizational, structure, is, that, there, is, no, conflict, of, interest, where, barristers, in, the, same, chambers, work, for, opposing, sides, in, a, case, and, in, some, specialized, chambers, this, is, commonplace, some, large, businesses, employ, their, own, legal, staff, in, a, legal, department, other, organizations, buy, in, legal, services, from, outside, companies, in, some, jurisdictions, either, the, judiciary, or, the, ministry, of, justice, directly, supervises, the, admission, licensing, and, regulation, of, lawyers, other, jurisdictions, by, statute, tradition, or, court, order, have, granted, such, powers, to, a, professional, association, which, all, lawyers, must, belong, to, in, the, u, s, such, associations, are, known, as, mandatory, integrated, or, unified, bar, associations, in, the, commonwealth, of, nations, similar, organizations, are, known, as, inns, of, court, bar, councils, or, law, societies, in, civil, law, countries, comparable, organizations, are, known, as, orders, of, advocates, chambers, of, advocates, colleges, of, advocates, faculties, of, advocates, or, similar, names, generally, a, nonmember, caught, practicing, law, may, be, liable, for, the, crime, of, unauthorized, practice, of, law, in, common, law, countries, with, divided, legal, professions, barristers, traditionally, belong, to, the, bar, council, or, an, inn, of, court, and, solicitors, belong, to, the, law, society, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, largest, mandatory, professional, association, of, lawyers, is, the, state, bar, of, california, with, 230, 000, members, some, countries, admit, and, regulate, lawyers, at, the, national, level, so, that, a, lawyer, once, licensed, can, argue, cases, in, any, court, in, the, land, this, can, be, seen, in, countries, including, new, zealand, japan, and, belgium, others, especially, those, with, federal, governments, tend, to, regulate, lawyers, at, the, state, or, provincial, level, this, is, the, case, in, the, united, states, canada, australia, and, switzerland, to, name, a, few, brazil, is, the, most, well, known, federal, government, that, regulates, lawyers, at, the, national, level, some, countries, like, italy, regulate, lawyers, at, the, regional, level, and, a, few, like, belgium, even, regulate, them, at, the, local, level, that, is, they, are, licensed, and, regulated, by, the, local, equivalent, of, bar, associations, but, can, advocate, in, courts, nationwide, in, germany, lawyers, are, admitted, to, regional, bars, and, may, appear, for, clients, before, all, courts, nationwide, with, the, exception, of, the, federal, court, of, justice, of, germany, bundesgerichtshof, or, bgh, generally, geographic, limitations, can, be, troublesome, for, a, lawyer, who, discovers, that, his, client, s, cause, requires, him, to, litigate, in, a, court, beyond, the, normal, geographic, scope, of, his, license, although, most, courts, have, special, pro, hac, vice, rules, for, such, occasions, the, lawyer, will, still, have, to, deal, with, a, different, set, of, professional, responsibility, rules, as, well, as, the, possibility, of, other, differences, in, substantive, and, procedural, law, some, countries, grant, licenses, to, non, resident, lawyers, who, may, then, appear, regularly, on, behalf, of, foreign, clients, others, require, all, lawyers, to, live, in, the, jurisdiction, or, to, even, hold, national, citizenship, as, a, prerequisite, for, receiving, a, license, to, practice, but, the, trend, in, industrialized, countries, since, the, 1970s, has, been, to, abolish, citizenship, and, residency, restrictions, for, example, the, supreme, court, of, canada, struck, down, a, citizenship, requirement, on, equality, rights, grounds, in, 1989, and, similarly, american, citizenship, and, residency, requirements, were, struck, down, as, unconstitutional, by, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, 1973, and, 1985, respectively, the, european, court, of, justice, made, similar, decisions, in, 1974, and, 1977, striking, down, citizenship, restrictions, in, belgium, and, france, a, key, difference, among, countries, is, whether, lawyers, should, be, regulated, solely, by, an, independent, judiciary, and, its, subordinate, institutions, a, self, regulating, legal, profession, or, whether, lawyers, should, be, subject, to, supervision, by, the, ministry, of, justice, in, the, executive, branch, in, most, civil, law, countries, the, government, has, traditionally, exercised, tight, control, over, the, legal, profession, in, order, to, ensure, a, steady, supply, of, loyal, judges, and, bureaucrats, that, is, lawyers, were, expected, first, and, foremost, to, serve, the, state, and, the, availability, of, counsel, for, private, litigants, was, an, afterthought, even, in, civil, law, countries, like, norway, which, have, partially, self, regulating, professions, the, ministry, of, justice, is, the, sole, issuer, of, licenses, and, makes, its, own, independent, re, evaluation, of, a, lawyer, s, fitness, to, practice, after, a, lawyer, has, been, expelled, from, the, advocates, association, brazil, is, an, unusual, exception, in, that, its, national, order, of, advocates, has, become, a, fully, self, regulating, institution, with, direct, control, over, licensing, and, has, successfully, resisted, government, attempts, to, place, it, under, the, control, of, the, ministry, of, labor, of, all, the, civil, law, countries, communist, countries, historically, went, the, farthest, towards, total, state, control, with, all, communist, lawyers, forced, to, practice, in, collectives, by, the, mid, 1950s, china, is, a, prime, example, technically, the, people, s, republic, of, china, did, not, have, lawyers, and, instead, had, only, poorly, trained, state, employed, legal, workers, prior, to, the, enactment, of, a, comprehensive, reform, package, in, 1996, by, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, people, s, congress, in, contrast, common, law, lawyers, have, traditionally, regulated, themselves, through, institutions, where, the, influence, of, non, lawyers, if, any, was, weak, and, indirect, despite, nominal, state, control, such, institutions, have, been, traditionally, dominated, by, private, practitioners, who, opposed, strong, state, control, of, the, profession, on, the, grounds, that, it, would, endanger, the, ability, of, lawyers, to, zealously, and, competently, advocate, their, clients, causes, in, the, adversarial, system, of, justice, however, the, concept, of, the, self, regulating, profession, has, been, criticized, as, a, sham, which, serves, to, legitimize, the, professional, monopoly, while, protecting, the, profession, from, public, scrutiny, in, some, jurisdictions, mechanisms, have, been, astonishingly, ineffective, and, penalties, have, been, light, or, nonexistent, voluntary, lawyer, associations, may, exist, at, all, geographic, levels, from, the, provincial, to, the, global, some, associations, are, termed, voluntary, bar, associations, in, some, countries, lawyers, have, also, formed, trade, unions, hostility, towards, the, legal, profession, is, a, widespread, phenomenon, for, example, william, shakespeare, famously, wrote, the, first, thing, we, do, let, s, kill, all, the, lawyers, in, henry, vi, part, 2, act, iv, scene, 2, the, legal, profession, was, abolished, in, prussia, in, 1780, and, in, france, in, 1789, though, both, countries, eventually, realized, that, their, judicial, systems, could, not, function, efficiently, without, lawyers, complaints, about, too, many, lawyers, were, common, in, both, england, and, the, united, states, in, the, 1840s, germany, in, the, 1910s, and, in, australia, canada, the, united, states, and, scotland, in, the, 1980s, public, distrust, of, lawyers, reached, record, heights, in, the, united, states, after, the, watergate, scandal, in, the, aftermath, of, watergate, legal, self, help, books, became, popular, among, those, who, wished, to, solve, their, legal, problems, without, having, to, deal, with, lawyers, lawyer, jokes, also, soared, in, popularity, in, english, speaking, north, america, as, a, result, of, watergate, in, adventures, in, law, and, justice, legal, researcher, bryan, horrigan, dedicated, a, chapter, to, myths, fictions, and, realities, about, law, and, illustrated, the, perennial, criticism, of, lawyers, as, amoral, guns, for, hire, with, a, quote, from, ambrose, bierce, s, satirical, the, devil, s, dictionary, that, summarized, the, noun, as, lawyer, n, one, skilled, in, circumvention, of, the, law, more, generally, in, legal, ethics, a, comparative, study, law, professor, geoffrey, c, hazard, jr, with, angelo, dondi, briefly, examined, the, regulations, attempting, to, suppress, lawyer, misconduct, and, noted, that, their, similarity, around, the, world, was, paralleled, by, a, remarkable, consistency, in, certain, persistent, grievances, about, lawyers, that, transcends, both, time, and, locale, from, the, bible, to, medieval, england, to, dynastic, china, the, authors, then, generalized, these, common, complaints, about, lawyers, as, being, classified, into, five, general, categories, as, follows, some, studies, have, shown, that, suicide, rates, among, lawyers, in, certain, jurisdictions, may, be, as, much, as, six, times, higher, than, the, average, population, and, commentators, suggest, that, the, low, opinion, the, public, has, of, lawyers, combined, with, their, own, high, ideals, of, justice, which, in, practice, they, may, see, denied, increase, the, depression, rates, of, those, in, this, profession, additionally, lawyers, are, twice, as, likely, to, suffer, from, addiction, to, alcohol, and, other, drugs, in, the, united, states, lawyers, typically, earn, between, 45, 000, and, 160, 000, per, year, although, earnings, vary, by, age, experience, and, practice, setting, solo, practitioners, typically, earn, less, than, lawyers, in, corporate, law, firms, but, more, than, those, working, for, state, or, local, government, lawyers, are, paid, for, their, work, in, a, variety, of, ways, in, private, practice, they, may, work, for, an, hourly, fee, according, to, a, billable, hour, structure, a, contingency, fee, or, a, lump, sum, payment, normally, most, lawyers, negotiate, a, written, fee, agreement, up, front, and, may, require, a, non, refundable, retainer, in, advance, recent, studies, suggest, that, when, lawyers, charge, a, fixed, fee, rather, than, billing, by, the, hour, they, work, less, hard, on, behalf, of, clients, and, clients, get, worse, outcomes, in, many, countries, there, are, fee, shifting, arrangements, by, which, the, loser, must, pay, the, winner, s, fees, and, costs, the, united, states, is, the, major, exception, although, in, turn, its, legislators, have, carved, out, many, exceptions, to, the, so, called, american, rule, of, no, fee, shifting, lawyers, working, directly, on, the, payroll, of, governments, nonprofits, and, corporations, usually, earn, a, regular, annual, salary, in, many, countries, with, the, notable, exception, of, germany, lawyers, can, also, volunteer, their, labor, in, the, service, of, worthy, causes, through, an, arrangement, called, pro, bono, short, for, pro, bono, publico, for, the, common, good, traditionally, such, work, was, performed, on, behalf, of, the, poor, but, in, some, countries, it, has, now, expanded, to, many, other, causes, such, as, environmental, law, in, some, countries, there, are, legal, aid, lawyers, who, specialize, in, providing, legal, services, to, the, indigent, france, and, spain, even, have, formal, fee, structures, by, which, lawyers, are, compensated, by, the, government, for, legal, aid, cases, on, a, per, case, basis, a, similar, system, though, not, as, extensive, or, generous, operates, in, australia, canada, and, south, africa, in, other, countries, legal, aid, specialists, are, practically, nonexistent, this, may, be, because, non, lawyers, are, allowed, to, provide, such, services, in, both, italy, and, belgium, trade, unions, and, political, parties, provide, what, can, be, characterized, as, legal, aid, services, some, legal, aid, in, belgium, is, also, provided, by, young, lawyer, apprentices, subsidized, by, local, bar, associations, known, as, the, pro, deo, system, as, well, as, consumer, protection, nonprofit, organizations, and, public, assistance, agencies, subsidized, by, local, governments, in, germany, mandatory, fee, structures, have, enabled, widespread, implementation, of, affordable, legal, expense, insurance, the, earliest, people, who, could, be, described, as, lawyers, were, probably, the, orators, of, ancient, athens, however, athenian, orators, faced, serious, structural, obstacles, first, there, was, a, rule, that, individuals, were, supposed, to, plead, their, own, cases, which, was, soon, bypassed, by, the, increasing, tendency, of, individuals, to, ask, a, friend, for, assistance, however, around, the, middle, of, the, fourth, century, the, athenians, disposed, of, the, perfunctory, request, for, a, friend, second, a, more, serious, obstacle, which, the, athenian, orators, never, completely, overcame, was, the, rule, that, no, one, could, take, a, fee, to, plead, the, cause, of, another, this, law, was, widely, disregarded, in, practice, but, was, never, abolished, which, meant, that, orators, could, never, present, themselves, as, legal, professionals, or, experts, they, had, to, uphold, the, legal, fiction, that, they, were, merely, an, ordinary, citizen, generously, helping, out, a, friend, for, free, and, thus, they, could, never, organize, into, a, real, profession, if, one, narrows, the, definition, of, lawyers, to, people, who, could, practice, the, legal, profession, openly, and, legally, then, the, first, lawyers, would, be, the, orators, of, ancient, rome, a, law, enacted, in, 204, bc, barred, roman, advocates, from, taking, fees, but, the, law, was, widely, ignored, the, ban, on, fees, was, abolished, by, emperor, claudius, who, legalized, advocacy, as, a, profession, and, allowed, the, roman, advocates, to, become, the, first, lawyers, who, could, practice, openly, but, he, also, imposed, a, fee, ceiling, of, 10, 000, sesterces, this, was, apparently, not, much, money, the, satires, of, juvenal, complained, that, there, was, no, money, in, working, as, an, advocate, like, their, greek, contemporaries, early, roman, advocates, were, trained, in, rhetoric, not, law, and, the, judges, before, whom, they, argued, were, also, not, legally, trained, but, very, early, on, unlike, athens, rome, developed, a, class, of, specialists, who, were, learned, in, the, law, known, as, jurisconsults, iuris, consulti, jurisconsults, were, wealthy, amateurs, who, dabbled, in, law, as, an, intellectual, hobby, they, did, not, make, their, primary, living, from, it, they, gave, legal, opinions, responsa, on, legal, issues, to, all, comers, a, practice, known, as, publice, respondere, roman, judges, and, governors, would, routinely, consult, with, an, advisory, panel, of, jurisconsults, before, rendering, a, decision, and, advocates, and, ordinary, people, also, went, to, jurisconsults, for, legal, opinions, the, romans, were, the, first, to, have, a, class, of, people, who, spent, their, days, thinking, about, legal, problems, and, this, is, why, their, law, developed, in, a, systematic, and, technical, way, during, the, roman, republic, and, the, early, roman, empire, jurisconsults, and, advocates, were, unregulated, since, the, former, were, amateurs, and, the, latter, were, technically, illegal, any, citizen, could, call, himself, an, advocate, or, a, legal, expert, though, whether, people, believed, him, would, depend, upon, his, personal, reputation, this, changed, once, claudius, legalized, the, legal, profession, by, the, start, of, the, byzantine, empire, the, legal, profession, had, become, well, established, heavily, regulated, and, highly, stratified, the, centralization, and, bureaucratization, of, the, profession, was, apparently, gradual, at, first, but, accelerated, during, the, reign, of, emperor, hadrian, at, the, same, time, the, jurisconsults, went, into, decline, during, the, imperial, period, by, the, fourth, century, advocates, had, to, be, enrolled, on, the, bar, of, a, court, to, argue, before, it, they, could, only, be, attached, to, one, court, at, a, time, and, there, were, restrictions, on, how, many, advocates, could, be, enrolled, at, a, particular, court, by, the, 380s, advocates, were, studying, law, in, addition, to, rhetoric, thus, reducing, the, need, for, a, separate, class, of, jurisconsults, in, 460, emperor, leo, imposed, a, requirement, that, new, advocates, seeking, admission, had, to, produce, testimonials, from, their, teachers, and, by, the, sixth, century, a, regular, course, of, legal, study, lasting, about, four, years, was, required, for, admission, claudius, s, fee, ceiling, lasted, all, the, way, into, the, byzantine, period, though, by, then, it, was, measured, at, 100, solidi, it, was, widely, evaded, either, through, demands, for, maintenance, and, expenses, or, a, sub, rosa, barter, transaction, the, latter, was, cause, for, disbarment, the, notaries, tabelliones, appeared, in, the, late, roman, empire, like, their, modern, day, descendants, the, civil, law, notaries, they, were, responsible, for, drafting, wills, conveyances, and, contracts, they, were, ubiquitous, and, most, villages, had, one, in, roman, times, notaries, were, widely, considered, to, be, inferior, to, advocates, and, jury, consults, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, the, onset, of, the, early, middle, ages, the, legal, profession, of, western, europe, collapsed, as, james, brundage, has, explained, no, one, in, western, europe, could, properly, be, described, as, a, professional, lawyer, or, a, professional, canonist, in, anything, like, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, professional, however, from, 1150, when, decretum, gratiani, was, compiled, onward, a, small, but, increasing, number, of, men, became, experts, in, canon, law, but, only, in, furtherance, of, other, occupational, goals, such, as, serving, the, catholic, church, as, priests, from, 1190, to, 1230, however, there, was, a, crucial, shift, in, which, some, men, began, to, practice, canon, law, as, a, lifelong, profession, in, itself, the, legal, profession, s, return, was, marked, by, the, renewed, efforts, of, church, and, state, to, regulate, it, in, 1231, two, french, councils, mandated, that, lawyers, had, to, swear, an, oath, of, admission, before, practicing, before, the, bishop, s, courts, in, their, regions, and, a, similar, oath, was, promulgated, by, the, papal, legate, in, london, in, 1237, during, the, same, decade, the, emperor, of, the, holy, roman, empire, frederick, ii, the, king, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, imposed, a, similar, oath, in, his, civil, courts, by, 1250, the, nucleus, of, a, new, legal, profession, had, clearly, formed, the, new, trend, towards, professionalization, culminated, in, a, controversial, proposal, at, the, second, council, of, lyon, in, 1275, that, all, ecclesiastical, courts, should, require, an, oath, of, admission, although, not, adopted, by, the, council, it, was, highly, influential, in, many, such, courts, throughout, europe, the, civil, courts, in, england, also, joined, the, trend, towards, professionalization, in, 1275, a, statute, was, enacted, that, prescribed, punishment, for, professional, lawyers, guilty, of, deceit, and, in, 1280, the, mayor, s, court, of, the, city, of, london, promulgated, regulations, concerning, admission, procedures, including, the, administering, of, an, oath, and, in, 1345, the, french, crown, promulgated, a, royal, ordinance, which, set, forth, 24, rules, governing, advocates, of, which, 12, were, integrated, into, the, oath, to, be, taken, by, them, the, french, medieval, oaths, were, widely, influential, and, of, enduring, importance, for, example, they, directly, influenced, the, structure, of, the, advocates, oath, adopted, by, the, canton, of, geneva, in, 1816, in, turn, the, 1816, geneva, oath, served, as, the, inspiration, for, the, attorney, s, oath, drafted, by, david, dudley, field, as, section, 511, of, the, proposed, new, york, code, of, civil, procedure, of, 1848, which, was, the, first, attempt, in, the, united, states, at, a, comprehensive, statement, of, a, lawyer, s, professional, duties
