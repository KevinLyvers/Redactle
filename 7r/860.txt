demography, from, ancient, greek, d, mos, people, society, and, graph, a, writing, drawing, description, is, the, statistical, study, of, human, populations, their, size, composition, e, g, ethnic, group, age, and, how, they, change, through, the, interplay, of, fertility, births, mortality, deaths, and, migration, demographic, analysis, examines, and, measures, the, dimensions, and, dynamics, of, populations, it, can, cover, whole, societies, or, groups, defined, by, criteria, such, as, education, nationality, religion, and, ethnicity, educational, institutions, usually, treat, demography, as, a, field, of, sociology, though, there, are, a, number, of, independent, demography, departments, these, methods, have, primarily, been, developed, to, study, human, populations, but, are, extended, to, a, variety, of, areas, where, researchers, want, to, know, how, populations, of, social, actors, can, change, across, time, through, processes, of, birth, death, and, migration, in, the, context, of, human, biological, populations, demographic, analysis, uses, administrative, records, to, develop, an, independent, estimate, of, the, population, demographic, analysis, estimates, are, often, considered, a, reliable, standard, for, judging, the, accuracy, of, the, census, information, gathered, at, any, time, in, the, labor, force, demographic, analysis, is, used, to, estimate, sizes, and, flows, of, populations, of, workers, in, population, ecology, the, focus, is, on, the, birth, death, migration, and, immigration, of, individuals, in, a, population, of, living, organisms, alternatively, in, social, human, sciences, could, involve, movement, of, firms, and, institutional, forms, demographic, analysis, is, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, contexts, for, example, it, is, often, used, in, business, plans, to, describe, the, population, connected, to, the, geographic, location, of, the, business, demographic, analysis, is, usually, abbreviated, as, da, for, the, 2010, u, s, census, the, u, s, census, bureau, has, expanded, its, da, categories, also, as, part, of, the, 2010, u, s, census, da, now, also, includes, comparative, analysis, between, independent, housing, estimates, and, census, address, lists, at, different, key, time, points, patient, demographics, form, the, core, of, the, data, for, any, medical, institution, such, as, patient, and, emergency, contact, information, and, patient, medical, record, data, they, allow, for, the, identification, of, a, patient, and, their, categorization, into, categories, for, the, purpose, of, statistical, analysis, patient, demographics, include, date, of, birth, gender, date, of, death, postal, code, ethnicity, blood, type, emergency, contact, information, family, doctor, insurance, provider, data, allergies, major, diagnoses, and, major, medical, history, formal, demography, limits, its, object, of, study, to, the, measurement, of, population, processes, while, the, broader, field, of, social, demography, or, population, studies, also, analyses, the, relationships, between, economic, social, institutional, cultural, and, biological, processes, influencing, a, population, demographic, thoughts, traced, back, to, antiquity, and, were, present, in, many, civilisations, and, cultures, like, ancient, greece, ancient, rome, china, and, india, made, up, of, the, prefix, demo, and, the, suffix, graphy, the, term, demography, refers, to, the, overall, study, of, population, in, ancient, greece, this, can, be, found, in, the, writings, of, herodotus, thucydides, hippocrates, epicurus, protagoras, polus, plato, and, aristotle, in, rome, writers, and, philosophers, like, cicero, seneca, pliny, the, elder, marcus, aurelius, epictetus, cato, and, columella, also, expressed, important, ideas, on, this, ground, in, the, middle, ages, christian, thinkers, devoted, much, time, in, refuting, the, classical, ideas, on, demography, important, contributors, to, the, field, were, william, of, conches, bartholomew, of, lucca, william, of, auvergne, william, of, pagula, and, muslim, sociologists, like, ibn, khaldun, one, of, the, earliest, demographic, studies, in, the, modern, period, was, natural, and, political, observations, made, upon, the, bills, of, mortality, 1662, by, john, graunt, which, contains, a, primitive, form, of, life, table, among, the, study, s, findings, were, that, one, third, of, the, children, in, london, died, before, their, sixteenth, birthday, mathematicians, such, as, edmond, halley, developed, the, life, table, as, the, basis, for, life, insurance, mathematics, richard, price, was, credited, with, the, first, textbook, on, life, contingencies, published, in, 1771, followed, later, by, augustus, de, morgan, on, the, application, of, probabilities, to, life, contingencies, 1838, in, 1755, benjamin, franklin, published, his, essay, observations, concerning, the, increase, of, mankind, peopling, of, countries, etc, projecting, exponential, growth, in, british, colonies, his, work, influenced, thomas, robert, malthus, who, writing, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, feared, that, if, unchecked, population, growth, would, tend, to, outstrip, growth, in, food, production, leading, to, ever, increasing, famine, and, poverty, see, malthusian, catastrophe, malthus, is, seen, as, the, intellectual, father, of, ideas, of, overpopulation, and, the, limits, to, growth, later, more, sophisticated, and, realistic, models, were, presented, by, benjamin, gompertz, and, verhulst, in, 1855, a, belgian, scholar, achille, guillard, defined, demography, as, the, natural, and, social, history, of, human, species, or, the, mathematical, knowledge, of, populations, of, their, general, changes, and, of, their, physical, civil, intellectual, and, moral, condition, the, period, 1860, 1910, can, be, characterized, as, a, period, of, transition, where, in, demography, emerged, from, statistics, as, a, separate, field, of, interest, this, period, included, a, panoply, of, international, great, demographers, like, adolphe, quetelet, 1796, 1874, william, farr, 1807, 1883, louis, adolphe, bertillon, 1821, 1883, and, his, son, jacques, 1851, 1922, joseph, k, r, si, 1844, 1906, anders, nicolas, kaier, 1838, 1919, richard, b, ckh, 1824, 1907, mile, durkheim, 1858, 1917, wilhelm, lexis, 1837, 1914, and, luigi, bodio, 1840, 1920, contributed, to, the, development, of, demography, and, to, the, toolkit, of, methods, and, techniques, of, demographic, analysis, demography, is, the, statistical, and, mathematical, study, of, the, size, composition, and, spatial, distribution, of, human, populations, and, how, these, features, change, over, time, data, are, obtained, from, a, census, of, the, population, and, from, registries, records, of, events, like, birth, deaths, migrations, marriages, divorces, diseases, and, employment, to, do, this, there, needs, to, be, an, understanding, of, how, they, are, calculated, and, the, questions, they, answer, which, are, included, in, these, four, concepts, population, change, standardization, of, population, numbers, the, demographic, bookkeeping, equation, and, population, composition, there, are, two, types, of, data, collection, direct, and, indirect, with, several, methods, of, each, type, direct, data, comes, from, vital, statistics, registries, that, track, all, births, and, deaths, as, well, as, certain, changes, in, legal, status, such, as, marriage, divorce, and, migration, registration, of, place, of, residence, in, developed, countries, with, good, registration, systems, such, as, the, united, states, and, much, of, europe, registry, statistics, are, the, best, method, for, estimating, the, number, of, births, and, deaths, a, census, is, the, other, common, direct, method, of, collecting, demographic, data, a, census, is, usually, conducted, by, a, national, government, and, attempts, to, enumerate, every, person, in, a, country, in, contrast, to, vital, statistics, data, which, are, typically, collected, continuously, and, summarized, on, an, annual, basis, censuses, typically, occur, only, every, 10, years, or, so, and, thus, are, not, usually, the, best, source, of, data, on, births, and, deaths, analyses, are, conducted, after, a, census, to, estimate, how, much, over, or, undercounting, took, place, these, compare, the, sex, ratios, from, the, census, data, to, those, estimated, from, natural, values, and, mortality, data, censuses, do, more, than, just, count, people, they, typically, collect, information, about, families, or, households, in, addition, to, individual, characteristics, such, as, age, sex, marital, status, literacy, education, employment, status, and, occupation, and, geographical, location, they, may, also, collect, data, on, migration, or, place, of, birth, or, of, previous, residence, language, religion, nationality, or, ethnicity, or, race, and, citizenship, in, countries, in, which, the, vital, registration, system, may, be, incomplete, the, censuses, are, also, used, as, a, direct, source, of, information, about, fertility, and, mortality, for, example, the, censuses, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, gather, information, on, births, and, deaths, that, occurred, in, the, 18, months, immediately, preceding, the, census, indirect, methods, of, collecting, data, are, required, in, countries, and, periods, where, full, data, are, not, available, such, as, is, the, case, in, much, of, the, developing, world, and, most, of, historical, demography, one, of, these, techniques, in, contemporary, demography, is, the, sister, method, where, survey, researchers, ask, women, how, many, of, their, sisters, have, died, or, had, children, and, at, what, age, with, these, surveys, researchers, can, then, indirectly, estimate, birth, or, death, rates, for, the, entire, population, other, indirect, methods, in, contemporary, demography, include, asking, people, about, siblings, parents, and, children, other, indirect, methods, are, necessary, in, historical, demography, there, are, a, variety, of, demographic, methods, for, modelling, population, processes, they, include, models, of, mortality, including, the, life, table, gompertz, models, hazards, models, cox, proportional, hazards, models, multiple, decrement, life, tables, brass, relational, logits, fertility, hermes, model, coale, trussell, models, parity, progression, ratios, marriage, singulate, mean, at, marriage, page, model, disability, sullivan, s, method, multistate, life, tables, population, projections, lee, carter, model, the, leslie, matrix, and, population, momentum, keyfitz, the, united, kingdom, has, a, series, of, four, national, birth, cohort, studies, the, first, three, spaced, apart, by, 12, years, the, 1946, national, survey, of, health, and, development, the, 1958, national, child, development, study, the, 1970, british, cohort, study, and, the, millennium, cohort, study, begun, much, more, recently, in, 2000, these, have, followed, the, lives, of, samples, of, people, typically, beginning, with, around, 17, 000, in, each, study, for, many, years, and, are, still, continuing, as, the, samples, have, been, drawn, in, a, nationally, representative, way, inferences, can, be, drawn, from, these, studies, about, the, differences, between, four, distinct, generations, of, british, people, in, terms, of, their, health, education, attitudes, childbearing, and, employment, patterns, indirect, standardization, is, used, when, a, population, is, small, enough, that, the, number, of, events, births, deaths, etc, are, also, small, in, this, case, methods, must, be, used, to, produce, a, standardized, mortality, rate, smr, or, standardized, incidence, rate, sir, population, change, is, analyzed, by, measuring, the, change, between, one, population, size, to, another, global, population, continues, to, rise, which, makes, population, change, an, essential, component, to, demographics, this, is, calculated, by, taking, one, population, size, minus, the, population, size, in, an, earlier, census, the, best, way, of, measuring, population, change, is, using, the, intercensal, percentage, change, the, intercensal, percentage, change, is, the, absolute, change, in, population, between, the, censuses, divided, by, the, population, size, in, the, earlier, census, next, multiply, this, a, hundredfold, to, receive, a, percentage, when, this, statistic, is, achieved, the, population, growth, between, two, or, more, nations, that, differ, in, size, can, be, accurately, measured, and, examined, for, there, to, be, a, significant, comparison, numbers, must, be, altered, for, the, size, of, the, population, that, is, under, study, for, example, the, fertility, rate, is, calculated, as, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, births, to, women, of, childbearing, age, to, the, total, number, of, women, in, this, age, range, if, these, adjustments, were, not, made, we, would, not, know, if, a, nation, with, a, higher, rate, of, births, or, deaths, has, a, population, with, more, women, of, childbearing, age, or, more, births, per, eligible, woman, within, the, category, of, standardization, there, are, two, major, approaches, direct, standardization, and, indirect, standardization, a, stable, population, does, not, necessarily, remain, fixed, in, size, it, can, be, expanding, or, shrinking, the, crude, death, rate, as, defined, above, and, applied, to, a, whole, population, can, give, a, misleading, impression, for, example, the, number, of, deaths, per, 1, 000, people, can, be, higher, in, developed, nations, than, in, less, developed, countries, despite, standards, of, health, being, better, in, developed, countries, this, is, because, developed, countries, have, proportionally, more, older, people, who, are, more, likely, to, die, in, a, given, year, so, that, the, overall, mortality, rate, can, be, higher, even, if, the, mortality, rate, at, any, given, age, is, lower, a, more, complete, picture, of, mortality, is, given, by, a, life, table, which, summarizes, mortality, separately, at, each, age, a, life, table, is, necessary, to, give, a, good, estimate, of, life, expectancy, suppose, that, a, country, or, other, entity, contains, population, t, persons, at, time, t, what, is, the, size, of, the, population, at, time, t, 1, natural, increase, from, time, t, to, t, 1, net, migration, from, time, t, to, t, 1, these, basic, equations, can, also, be, applied, to, subpopulations, for, example, the, population, size, of, ethnic, groups, or, nationalities, within, a, given, society, or, country, is, subject, to, the, same, sources, of, change, when, dealing, with, ethnic, groups, however, net, migration, might, have, to, be, subdivided, into, physical, migration, and, ethnic, reidentification, assimilation, individuals, who, change, their, ethnic, self, labels, or, whose, ethnic, classification, in, government, statistics, changes, over, time, may, be, thought, of, as, migrating, or, moving, from, one, population, subcategory, to, another, more, generally, while, the, basic, demographic, equation, holds, true, by, definition, in, practice, the, recording, and, counting, of, events, births, deaths, immigration, emigration, and, the, enumeration, of, the, total, population, size, are, subject, to, error, so, allowance, needs, to, be, made, for, error, in, the, underlying, statistics, when, any, accounting, of, population, size, or, change, is, made, the, figure, in, this, section, shows, the, latest, 2004, un, united, nations, who, projections, of, world, population, out, to, the, year, 2150, red, high, orange, medium, green, low, the, un, medium, projection, shows, world, population, reaching, an, approximate, equilibrium, at, 9, billion, by, 2075, working, independently, demographers, at, the, international, institute, for, applied, systems, analysis, in, austria, expect, world, population, to, peak, at, 9, billion, by, 2070, throughout, the, 21st, century, the, average, age, of, the, population, is, likely, to, continue, to, rise, populations, can, change, through, three, processes, fertility, mortality, and, migration, fertility, involves, the, number, of, children, that, women, have, and, is, to, be, contrasted, with, fecundity, a, woman, s, childbearing, potential, mortality, is, the, study, of, the, causes, consequences, and, measurement, of, processes, affecting, death, to, members, of, the, population, demographers, most, commonly, study, mortality, using, the, life, table, a, statistical, device, that, provides, information, about, the, mortality, conditions, most, notably, the, life, expectancy, in, the, population, migration, refers, to, the, movement, of, persons, from, a, locality, of, origin, to, a, destination, place, across, some, predefined, political, boundary, migration, researchers, do, not, designate, movements, migrations, unless, they, are, somewhat, permanent, thus, demographers, do, not, consider, tourists, and, travellers, to, be, migrating, while, demographers, who, study, migration, typically, do, so, through, census, data, on, place, of, residence, indirect, sources, of, data, including, tax, forms, and, labour, force, surveys, are, also, important, demography, is, today, widely, taught, in, many, universities, across, the, world, attracting, students, with, initial, training, in, social, sciences, statistics, or, health, studies, being, at, the, crossroads, of, several, disciplines, such, as, sociology, economics, epidemiology, geography, anthropology, and, history, demography, offers, tools, to, approach, a, large, range, of, population, issues, by, combining, a, more, technical, quantitative, approach, that, represents, the, core, of, the, discipline, with, many, other, methods, borrowed, from, social, or, other, sciences, demographic, research, is, conducted, in, universities, in, research, institutes, as, well, as, in, statistical, departments, and, in, several, international, agencies, population, institutions, are, part, of, the, cicred, international, committee, for, coordination, of, demographic, research, network, while, most, individual, scientists, engaged, in, demographic, research, are, members, of, the, international, union, for, the, scientific, study, of, population, or, a, national, association, such, as, the, population, association, of, america, in, the, united, states, or, affiliates, of, the, federation, of, canadian, demographers, in, canada, population, composition, is, the, description, of, population, defined, by, characteristics, such, as, age, race, sex, or, marital, status, these, descriptions, can, be, necessary, for, understanding, the, social, dynamics, from, historical, and, comparative, research, this, data, is, often, compared, using, a, population, pyramid, population, composition, is, also, a, very, important, part, of, historical, research, information, ranging, back, hundreds, of, years, is, not, always, worthwhile, because, the, numbers, of, people, for, which, data, are, available, may, not, provide, the, information, that, is, important, such, as, population, size, lack, of, information, on, the, original, data, collection, procedures, may, prevent, accurate, evaluation, of, data, quality, the, demographic, analysis, of, labor, markets, can, be, used, to, show, slow, population, growth, population, aging, and, the, increased, importance, of, immigration, the, u, s, census, bureau, projects, that, in, the, next, 100, years, the, united, states, will, face, some, dramatic, demographic, changes, the, population, is, expected, to, grow, more, slowly, and, age, more, rapidly, than, ever, before, and, the, nation, will, become, a, nation, of, immigrants, this, influx, is, projected, to, rise, over, the, next, century, as, new, immigrants, and, their, children, will, account, for, over, half, the, u, s, population, these, demographic, shifts, could, ignite, major, adjustments, in, the, economy, more, specifically, in, labor, markets, people, decide, to, exit, organizations, for, many, reasons, such, as, better, jobs, dissatisfaction, and, concerns, within, the, family, the, causes, of, turnover, can, be, split, into, two, separate, factors, one, linked, with, the, culture, of, the, organization, and, the, other, relating, to, all, other, factors, people, who, do, not, fully, accept, a, culture, might, leave, voluntarily, or, some, individuals, might, leave, because, they, fail, to, fit, in, and, fail, to, change, within, a, particular, organization, a, basic, definition, of, population, ecology, is, a, study, of, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, organisms, as, it, relates, to, organizations, and, demography, organizations, go, through, various, liabilities, to, their, continued, survival, hospitals, like, all, other, large, and, complex, organizations, are, impacted, in, the, environment, they, work, for, example, a, study, was, done, on, the, closure, of, acute, care, hospitals, in, florida, between, a, particular, time, the, study, examined, effect, size, age, and, niche, density, of, these, particular, hospitals, a, population, theory, says, that, organizational, outcomes, are, mostly, determined, by, environmental, factors, among, several, factors, of, the, theory, there, are, four, that, apply, to, the, hospital, closure, example, size, age, density, of, niches, in, which, organizations, operate, and, density, of, niches, in, which, organizations, are, established, problems, in, which, demographers, may, be, called, upon, to, assist, business, organizations, are, when, determining, the, best, prospective, location, in, an, area, of, a, branch, store, or, service, outlet, predicting, the, demand, for, a, new, product, and, to, analyze, certain, dynamics, of, a, company, s, workforce, choosing, a, new, location, for, a, branch, of, a, bank, choosing, the, area, in, which, to, start, a, new, supermarket, consulting, a, bank, loan, officer, that, a, particular, location, would, be, a, beneficial, site, to, start, a, car, wash, and, determining, what, shopping, area, would, be, best, to, buy, and, be, redeveloped, in, metropolis, area, are, types, of, problems, in, which, demographers, can, be, called, upon, standardization, is, a, useful, demographic, technique, used, in, the, analysis, of, a, business, it, can, be, used, as, an, interpretive, and, analytic, tool, for, the, comparison, of, different, markets, these, organizations, have, interests, about, the, number, and, characteristics, of, their, clients, so, they, can, maximize, the, sale, of, their, products, their, outlook, on, their, influence, or, the, ends, of, their, power, services, and, beneficial, works
