censorship, is, the, suppression, of, speech, public, communication, or, other, information, this, may, be, done, on, the, basis, that, such, material, is, considered, objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or, inconvenient, censorship, can, be, conducted, by, governments, private, institutions, when, an, individual, such, as, an, author, or, other, creator, engages, in, censorship, of, their, own, works, or, speech, it, is, referred, to, as, self, censorship, general, censorship, occurs, in, a, variety, of, different, media, including, speech, books, music, films, and, other, arts, the, press, radio, television, and, the, internet, for, a, variety, of, claimed, reasons, including, national, security, to, control, obscenity, pornography, and, hate, speech, to, protect, children, or, other, vulnerable, groups, to, promote, or, restrict, political, or, religious, views, and, to, prevent, slander, and, libel, specific, rules, and, regulations, regarding, censorship, vary, between, legal, jurisdictions, and, or, private, organizations, in, 399, bc, greek, philosopher, socrates, while, defying, attempts, by, the, athenian, state, to, censor, his, philosophical, teachings, was, accused, of, collateral, charges, related, to, the, corruption, of, athenian, youth, and, sentenced, to, death, by, drinking, a, poison, hemlock, the, details, of, socrates, s, conviction, are, recorded, by, plato, as, follows, in, 399, bc, socrates, went, on, trial, and, was, subsequently, found, guilty, of, both, corrupting, the, minds, of, the, youth, of, athens, and, of, impiety, asebeia, not, believing, in, the, gods, of, the, state, and, as, a, punishment, sentenced, to, death, caused, by, the, drinking, of, a, mixture, containing, hemlock, socrates, student, plato, is, said, to, have, advocated, censorship, in, his, essay, on, the, republic, which, opposed, the, existence, of, democracy, in, contrast, to, plato, greek, playwright, euripides, 480, 406, bc, defended, the, true, liberty, of, freeborn, men, including, the, right, to, speak, freely, in, 1766, sweden, became, the, first, country, to, abolish, censorship, by, law, censorship, has, been, criticized, throughout, history, for, being, unfair, and, hindering, progress, in, a, 1997, essay, on, internet, censorship, social, commentator, michael, landier, explains, that, censorship, is, counterproductive, as, it, prevents, the, censored, topic, from, being, discussed, landier, expands, his, argument, by, claiming, that, those, who, impose, censorship, must, consider, what, they, censor, to, be, true, as, individuals, believing, themselves, to, be, correct, would, welcome, the, opportunity, to, disprove, those, with, opposing, views, censorship, is, often, used, to, impose, moral, values, on, society, as, in, the, censorship, of, material, considered, obscene, english, novelist, e, m, forster, was, a, staunch, opponent, of, censoring, material, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, obscene, or, immoral, raising, the, issue, of, moral, subjectivity, and, the, constant, changing, of, moral, values, when, the, 1928, novel, lady, chatterley, s, lover, was, put, on, trial, in, 1960, forster, wrote, lady, chatterley, s, lover, is, a, literary, work, of, importance, i, do, not, think, that, it, could, be, held, obscene, but, am, in, a, difficulty, here, for, the, reason, that, i, have, never, been, able, to, follow, the, legal, definition, of, obscenity, the, law, tells, me, that, obscenity, may, deprave, and, corrupt, but, as, far, as, i, know, it, offers, no, definition, of, depravity, or, corruption, proponents, have, sought, to, justify, it, using, different, rationales, for, various, types, of, information, censored, in, wartime, explicit, censorship, is, carried, out, with, the, intent, of, preventing, the, release, of, information, that, might, be, useful, to, an, enemy, typically, it, involves, keeping, times, or, locations, secret, or, delaying, the, release, of, information, e, g, an, operational, objective, until, it, is, of, no, possible, use, to, enemy, forces, the, moral, issues, here, are, often, seen, as, somewhat, different, as, the, proponents, of, this, form, of, censorship, argue, that, the, release, of, tactical, information, usually, presents, a, greater, risk, of, casualties, among, one, s, own, forces, and, could, possibly, lead, to, loss, of, the, overall, conflict, during, world, war, i, letters, written, by, british, soldiers, would, have, to, go, through, censorship, this, consisted, of, officers, going, through, letters, with, a, black, marker, and, crossing, out, anything, which, might, compromise, operational, secrecy, before, the, letter, was, sent, the, world, war, ii, catchphrase, loose, lips, sink, ships, was, used, as, a, common, justification, to, exercise, official, wartime, censorship, and, encourage, individual, restraint, when, sharing, potentially, sensitive, information, an, example, of, sanitization, policies, comes, from, the, ussr, under, joseph, stalin, where, publicly, used, photographs, were, often, altered, to, remove, people, whom, stalin, had, condemned, to, execution, though, past, photographs, may, have, been, remembered, or, kept, this, deliberate, and, systematic, alteration, to, all, of, history, in, the, public, mind, is, seen, as, one, of, the, central, themes, of, stalinism, and, totalitarianism, censorship, is, occasionally, carried, out, to, aid, authorities, or, to, protect, an, individual, as, with, some, kidnappings, when, attention, and, media, coverage, of, the, victim, can, sometimes, be, seen, as, unhelpful, censorship, by, religion, is, a, form, of, censorship, where, freedom, of, expression, is, controlled, or, limited, using, religious, authority, or, on, the, basis, of, the, teachings, of, the, religion, this, form, of, censorship, has, a, long, history, and, is, practiced, in, many, societies, and, by, many, religions, examples, include, the, galileo, affair, edict, of, compi, gne, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, list, of, prohibited, books, and, the, condemnation, of, salman, rushdie, s, novel, the, satanic, verses, by, iranian, leader, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, images, of, the, islamic, figure, muhammad, are, also, regularly, censored, in, some, secular, countries, this, is, sometimes, done, to, prevent, hurting, religious, sentiments, the, content, of, school, textbooks, is, often, an, issue, of, debate, since, their, target, audiences, are, young, people, the, term, whitewashing, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, revisionism, aimed, at, glossing, over, difficult, or, questionable, historical, events, or, a, biased, presentation, thereof, the, reporting, of, military, atrocities, in, history, is, extremely, controversial, as, in, the, case, of, the, holocaust, or, holocaust, denial, bombing, of, dresden, the, nanking, massacre, as, found, with, japanese, history, textbook, controversies, the, armenian, genocide, the, tiananmen, square, protests, of, 1989, and, the, winter, soldier, investigation, of, the, vietnam, war, in, the, context, of, secondary, school, education, the, way, facts, and, history, are, presented, greatly, influences, the, interpretation, of, contemporary, thought, opinion, and, socialization, one, argument, for, censoring, the, type, of, information, disseminated, is, based, on, the, inappropriate, quality, of, such, material, for, the, younger, public, the, use, of, the, inappropriate, distinction, is, in, itself, controversial, as, it, changed, heavily, a, ballantine, books, version, of, the, book, fahrenheit, 451, which, is, the, version, used, by, most, school, classes, contained, approximately, 75, separate, edits, omissions, and, changes, from, the, original, bradbury, manuscript, in, february, 2006, a, national, geographic, cover, was, censored, by, the, nashravaran, journalistic, institute, the, offending, cover, was, about, the, subject, of, love, and, a, picture, of, an, embracing, couple, was, hidden, beneath, a, white, sticker, economic, induced, censorship, is, a, type, of, censorship, enacted, by, economic, markets, to, favor, and, disregard, types, of, information, economic, induced, censorship, is, also, caused, by, market, forces, which, privatize, and, establish, commodification, of, certain, information, that, is, not, accessible, by, the, general, public, primarily, because, of, the, cost, associated, with, commodified, information, such, as, academic, journals, industry, reports, and, pay, to, use, repositories, the, concept, was, illustrated, as, a, censorship, pyramid, that, was, conceptualized, by, primarily, julian, assange, along, with, andy, m, ller, maguhn, jacob, appelbaum, and, j, r, mie, zimmermann, in, the, cypherpunks, book, self, censorship, is, the, act, of, censoring, or, classifying, one, s, own, discourse, this, is, done, out, of, fear, of, or, deference, to, the, sensibilities, or, preferences, actual, or, perceived, of, others, and, without, overt, pressure, from, any, specific, party, or, institution, of, authority, self, censorship, is, often, practiced, by, film, producers, film, directors, publishers, news, anchors, journalists, musicians, and, other, kinds, of, authors, including, individuals, who, use, social, media, according, to, a, pew, research, center, and, the, columbia, journalism, review, survey, about, one, quarter, of, the, local, and, national, journalists, say, they, have, purposely, avoided, newsworthy, stories, while, nearly, as, many, acknowledge, they, have, softened, the, tone, of, stories, to, benefit, the, interests, of, their, news, organizations, fully, four, in, ten, 41, admit, they, have, engaged, in, either, or, both, of, these, practices, threats, to, media, freedom, have, shown, a, significant, increase, in, europe, in, recent, years, according, to, a, study, published, in, april, 2017, by, the, council, of, europe, this, results, in, a, fear, of, physical, or, psychological, violence, and, the, ultimate, result, is, self, censorship, by, journalists, copy, approval, is, the, right, to, read, and, amend, an, article, usually, an, interview, before, publication, many, publications, refuse, to, give, copy, approval, but, it, is, increasingly, becoming, common, practice, when, dealing, with, publicity, anxious, celebrities, picture, approval, is, the, right, given, to, an, individual, to, choose, which, photos, will, be, published, and, which, will, not, robert, redford, is, well, known, for, insisting, upon, picture, approval, writer, approval, is, when, writers, are, chosen, based, on, whether, they, will, write, flattering, articles, or, not, hollywood, publicist, pat, kingsley, is, known, for, banning, certain, writers, who, wrote, undesirably, about, one, of, her, clients, from, interviewing, any, of, her, other, clients, flooding, the, public, often, through, online, social, networks, with, false, or, misleading, information, is, sometimes, called, reverse, censorship, american, legal, scholar, tim, wu, has, explained, that, this, type, of, information, control, sometimes, by, state, actors, can, distort, or, drown, out, disfavored, speech, through, the, creation, and, dissemination, of, fake, news, the, payment, of, fake, commentators, and, the, deployment, of, propaganda, robots, soft, or, indirect, censorship, is, the, practice, of, influencing, news, coverage, by, applying, financial, pressure, on, media, companies, that, are, deemed, critical, of, a, government, or, its, policies, and, rewarding, media, outlets, and, individual, journalists, who, are, seen, as, friendly, to, the, government, book, censorship, can, be, enacted, at, the, national, or, sub, national, level, and, can, carry, legal, penalties, for, their, infraction, books, may, also, be, challenged, at, a, local, community, level, as, a, result, books, can, be, removed, from, schools, or, libraries, although, these, bans, do, not, typically, extend, outside, of, that, area, aside, from, the, usual, justifications, of, pornography, and, obscenity, some, films, are, censored, due, to, changing, racial, attitudes, or, political, correctness, in, order, to, avoid, ethnic, stereotyping, and, or, ethnic, offense, despite, its, historical, or, artistic, value, one, example, is, the, still, withdrawn, censored, eleven, series, of, animated, cartoons, which, may, have, been, innocent, then, but, are, incorrect, now, film, censorship, is, carried, out, by, various, countries, film, censorship, is, achieved, by, censoring, the, producer, or, restricting, a, state, citizen, for, example, in, china, the, film, industry, censors, lgbt, related, films, filmmakers, must, resort, to, finding, funds, from, international, investors, such, as, the, ford, foundations, and, or, produce, through, an, independent, film, company, music, censorship, has, been, implemented, by, states, religions, educational, systems, families, retailers, and, lobbying, groups, and, in, most, cases, they, violate, international, conventions, of, human, rights, censorship, of, maps, is, often, employed, for, military, purposes, for, example, the, technique, was, used, in, former, east, germany, especially, for, the, areas, near, the, border, to, west, germany, in, order, to, make, attempts, of, defection, more, difficult, censorship, of, maps, is, also, applied, by, google, maps, where, certain, areas, are, grayed, out, or, blacked, or, areas, are, purposely, left, outdated, with, old, imagery, art, is, loved, and, feared, because, of, its, evocative, power, destroying, or, oppressing, art, can, potentially, justify, its, meaning, even, more, british, photographer, and, visual, artist, graham, ovenden, s, photos, and, paintings, were, ordered, to, be, destroyed, by, a, london, s, magistrate, court, in, 2015, for, being, indecent, and, their, copies, had, been, removed, from, the, online, tate, gallery, a, 1980, israeli, law, forbade, banned, artwork, composed, of, the, four, colours, of, the, palestinian, flag, and, palestinians, were, arrested, for, displaying, such, artwork, or, even, for, carrying, sliced, melons, with, the, same, pattern, moath, al, alwi, is, a, guantanamo, bay, prisoner, who, creates, model, ships, as, an, expression, of, art, alwi, does, so, with, the, few, tools, he, has, at, his, disposal, such, as, dental, floss, and, shampoo, bottles, and, he, is, also, allowed, to, use, a, small, pair, of, scissors, with, rounded, edges, a, few, of, alwi, s, pieces, are, on, display, at, john, jay, college, of, criminal, justice, in, new, york, there, are, also, other, artworks, on, display, at, the, college, that, were, created, by, other, inmates, the, artwork, that, is, being, displayed, might, be, the, only, way, for, some, of, the, inmates, to, communicate, with, the, outside, recently, things, have, changed, though, the, military, has, come, up, with, a, new, policy, that, will, not, allow, the, artwork, at, guantanamo, bay, military, prison, to, leave, the, prison, the, artwork, created, by, alwi, and, other, prisoners, is, now, government, property, and, can, be, destroyed, or, disposed, of, in, whatever, way, the, government, choose, making, it, no, longer, the, artist, s, property, around, 300, artists, in, cuba, are, fighting, for, their, artistic, freedom, due, to, new, censorship, rules, cuba, s, government, has, in, place, for, artists, in, december, 2018, following, the, introduction, of, new, rules, that, would, ban, music, performances, and, artwork, not, authorized, by, the, state, performance, artist, tania, bruguera, was, detained, upon, arriving, to, havana, and, released, after, four, days, an, example, of, extreme, state, censorship, was, the, nazis, requirements, of, using, art, as, propaganda, art, was, only, allowed, to, be, used, as, a, political, instrument, to, control, people, and, failure, to, act, in, accordance, with, the, censors, was, punishable, by, law, even, fatal, the, degenerate, art, exhibition, was, a, historical, instance, of, this, the, goal, of, which, was, to, advertise, nazi, values, and, slander, others, internet, censorship, is, control, or, suppression, of, the, publishing, or, accessing, of, information, on, the, internet, it, may, be, carried, out, by, governments, or, by, private, organizations, either, at, the, behest, of, the, government, or, on, their, own, initiative, individuals, and, organizations, may, engage, in, self, censorship, on, their, own, or, due, to, intimidation, and, fear, the, issues, associated, with, internet, censorship, are, similar, to, those, for, offline, censorship, of, more, traditional, media, one, difference, is, that, national, borders, are, more, permeable, online, residents, of, a, country, that, bans, certain, information, can, find, it, on, websites, hosted, outside, the, country, thus, censors, must, work, to, prevent, access, to, information, even, though, they, lack, physical, or, legal, control, over, the, websites, themselves, this, in, turn, requires, the, use, of, technical, censorship, methods, that, are, unique, to, the, internet, such, as, site, blocking, and, content, filtering, furthermore, the, domain, name, system, dns, a, critical, component, of, the, internet, is, dominated, by, centralized, and, few, entities, the, most, widely, used, dns, root, is, administered, by, the, internet, corporation, for, assigned, names, and, numbers, icann, as, an, administrator, they, have, rights, to, shut, down, and, seize, domain, names, when, they, deem, necessary, to, do, so, and, at, most, times, the, direction, is, from, governments, this, has, been, the, case, with, wikileaks, shutdowns, and, name, seizure, events, such, as, the, ones, executed, by, the, national, intellectual, property, rights, coordination, center, ipr, center, managed, by, the, homeland, security, investigations, hsi, this, makes, it, easy, for, internet, censorship, by, authorities, as, they, have, control, over, what, should, or, should, not, be, on, the, internet, some, activists, and, researchers, have, started, opting, for, alternative, dns, roots, though, the, internet, architecture, board, iab, does, not, support, these, dns, root, providers, unless, the, censor, has, total, control, over, all, internet, connected, computers, such, as, in, north, korea, or, cuba, total, censorship, of, information, is, very, difficult, or, impossible, to, achieve, due, to, the, underlying, distributed, technology, of, the, internet, pseudonymity, and, data, havens, such, as, freenet, protect, free, speech, using, technologies, that, guarantee, material, cannot, be, removed, and, prevents, the, identification, of, authors, technologically, savvy, users, can, often, find, ways, to, access, blocked, content, nevertheless, blocking, remains, an, effective, means, of, limiting, access, to, sensitive, information, for, most, users, when, censors, such, as, those, in, china, are, able, to, devote, significant, resources, to, building, and, maintaining, a, comprehensive, censorship, system, views, about, the, feasibility, and, effectiveness, of, internet, censorship, have, evolved, in, parallel, with, the, development, of, the, internet, and, censorship, technologies, a, bbc, world, service, poll, of, 27, 973, adults, in, 26, countries, including, 14, 306, internet, users, was, conducted, between, 30, november, 2009, and, 7, february, 2010, the, head, of, the, polling, organization, felt, overall, that, the, poll, showed, that, the, poll, found, that, nearly, four, in, five, 78, internet, users, felt, that, the, internet, had, brought, them, greater, freedom, that, most, internet, users, 53, felt, that, the, internet, should, never, be, regulated, by, any, level, of, government, anywhere, and, almost, four, in, five, internet, users, and, non, users, around, the, world, felt, that, access, to, the, internet, was, a, fundamental, right, 50, strongly, agreed, 29, somewhat, agreed, 9, somewhat, disagreed, 6, strongly, disagreed, and, 6, gave, no, opinion, the, rising, use, of, social, media, in, many, nations, has, led, to, the, emergence, of, citizens, organizing, protests, through, social, media, sometimes, called, twitter, revolutions, the, most, notable, of, these, social, media, led, protests, were, the, arab, spring, uprisings, starting, in, 2010, in, response, to, the, use, of, social, media, in, these, protests, the, tunisian, government, began, a, hack, of, tunisian, citizens, facebook, accounts, and, reports, arose, of, accounts, being, deleted, automated, systems, can, be, used, to, censor, social, media, posts, and, therefore, limit, what, citizens, can, say, online, this, most, notably, occurs, in, china, where, social, media, posts, are, automatically, censored, depending, on, content, in, 2013, harvard, political, science, professor, gary, king, led, a, study, to, determine, what, caused, social, media, posts, to, be, censored, and, found, that, posts, mentioning, the, government, were, not, more, or, less, likely, to, be, deleted, if, they, were, supportive, or, critical, of, the, government, posts, mentioning, collective, action, were, more, likely, to, be, deleted, than, those, that, had, not, mentioned, collective, action, currently, social, media, censorship, appears, primarily, as, a, way, to, restrict, internet, users, ability, to, organize, protests, for, the, chinese, government, seeing, citizens, unhappy, with, local, governance, is, beneficial, as, state, and, national, leaders, can, replace, unpopular, officials, king, and, his, researchers, were, able, to, predict, when, certain, officials, would, be, removed, based, on, the, number, of, unfavorable, social, media, posts, research, has, proved, that, criticism, is, tolerable, on, social, media, sites, therefore, it, is, not, censored, unless, it, has, a, higher, chance, of, collective, action, it, is, not, important, whether, the, criticism, is, supportive, or, unsupportive, of, the, states, leaders, the, main, priority, of, censoring, certain, social, media, posts, is, to, make, sure, that, no, big, actions, are, being, made, due, to, something, that, was, said, on, the, internet, posts, that, challenge, the, party, s, political, leading, role, in, the, chinese, government, are, more, likely, to, be, censored, due, to, the, challenges, it, poses, to, the, chinese, communist, party, in, december, 2022, elon, musk, owner, and, ceo, of, twitter, released, internal, documents, from, the, social, media, microblogging, site, to, journalists, matt, taibbi, michael, shellenberger, and, bari, weiss, the, analysis, of, these, files, on, twitter, collectively, called, the, twitter, files, explored, the, content, moderation, and, visibility, filtering, carried, out, in, collaboration, with, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, on, the, hunter, biden, laptop, controversy, on, the, platform, tiktok, certain, hashtags, have, been, categorized, by, the, platform, s, code, and, determines, how, viewers, can, or, cannot, interact, with, the, content, or, hashtag, specifically, some, shadowbanned, tags, include, acab, gayarab, gej, due, to, their, referencing, of, certain, social, movements, and, lgbtq, identity, as, tiktok, guidelines, are, becoming, more, localized, around, the, world, some, experts, believe, that, this, could, result, in, more, censorship, than, before, since, the, early, 1980s, advocates, of, video, games, have, emphasized, their, use, as, an, expressive, medium, arguing, for, their, protection, under, the, laws, governing, freedom, of, speech, and, also, as, an, educational, tool, detractors, argue, that, video, games, are, harmful, and, therefore, should, be, subject, to, legislative, oversight, and, restrictions, many, video, games, have, certain, elements, removed, or, edited, due, to, regional, rating, standards, for, example, in, the, japanese, and, pal, versions, of, no, more, heroes, blood, splatter, and, gore, is, removed, from, the, gameplay, decapitation, scenes, are, implied, but, not, shown, scenes, of, missing, body, parts, after, having, been, cut, off, are, replaced, with, the, same, scene, but, showing, the, body, parts, fully, intact, surveillance, and, censorship, are, different, surveillance, can, be, performed, without, censorship, but, it, is, harder, to, engage, in, censorship, without, some, form, of, surveillance, even, when, surveillance, does, not, lead, directly, to, censorship, the, widespread, knowledge, or, belief, that, a, person, their, computer, or, their, use, of, the, internet, is, under, surveillance, can, have, a, chilling, effect, and, lead, to, self, censorship, the, former, soviet, union, maintained, a, particularly, extensive, program, of, state, imposed, censorship, the, main, organ, for, official, censorship, in, the, soviet, union, was, the, chief, agency, for, protection, of, military, and, state, secrets, generally, known, as, the, glavlit, its, russian, acronym, the, glavlit, handled, censorship, matters, arising, from, domestic, writings, of, just, about, any, kind, even, beer, and, vodka, labels, glavlit, censorship, personnel, were, present, in, every, large, soviet, publishing, house, or, newspaper, the, agency, employed, some, 70, 000, censors, to, review, information, before, it, was, disseminated, by, publishing, houses, editorial, offices, and, broadcasting, studios, no, mass, medium, escaped, glavlit, s, control, all, press, agencies, and, radio, and, television, stations, had, glavlit, representatives, on, their, editorial, staffs, sometimes, public, knowledge, of, the, existence, of, a, specific, document, is, subtly, suppressed, a, situation, resembling, censorship, the, authorities, taking, such, action, will, justify, it, by, declaring, the, work, to, be, subversive, or, inconvenient, an, example, is, michel, foucault, s, 1978, text, sexual, morality, and, the, law, later, republished, as, the, danger, of, child, sexuality, originally, published, as, la, loi, de, la, pudeur, this, work, defends, the, decriminalization, of, statutory, rape, and, the, abolition, of, age, of, consent, laws, when, a, publisher, comes, under, pressure, to, suppress, a, book, but, has, already, entered, into, a, contract, with, the, author, they, will, sometimes, effectively, censor, the, book, by, deliberately, ordering, a, small, print, run, and, making, minimal, if, any, attempts, to, publicize, it, this, practice, became, known, in, the, early, 2000s, as, privishing, priv, ate, publ, ishing, an, opennet, initiative, oni, classifications, censorship, for, individual, countries, is, measured, by, freedom, house, fh,
