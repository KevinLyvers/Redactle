common, law, also, known, as, judicial, precedent, judge, made, law, or, case, law, is, the, body, of, law, created, by, judges, and, similar, quasi, judicial, tribunals, by, virtue, of, being, stated, in, written, opinions, the, defining, characteristic, of, common, law, is, that, it, arises, as, precedent, common, law, courts, look, to, the, past, decisions, of, courts, to, synthesize, the, legal, principles, of, past, cases, stare, decisis, the, principle, that, cases, should, be, decided, according, to, consistent, principled, rules, so, that, similar, facts, will, yield, similar, results, lies, at, the, heart, of, all, common, law, systems, if, a, court, finds, that, a, similar, dispute, to, the, present, one, has, been, resolved, in, the, past, the, court, is, generally, bound, to, follow, the, reasoning, used, in, the, prior, decision, if, however, the, court, finds, that, the, current, dispute, is, fundamentally, distinct, from, all, previous, cases, a, matter, of, first, impression, and, legislative, statutes, also, called, positive, law, are, either, silent, or, ambiguous, on, the, question, judges, have, the, authority, and, duty, to, resolve, the, issue, the, opinion, from, a, common, law, judge, agglomerates, with, past, decisions, as, precedent, to, bind, future, judges, and, litigants, unless, overturned, by, subsequent, developments, in, the, statutory, law, by, legislature, or, in, the, case, law, by, appeal, courts, the, common, law, so, named, because, it, was, common, to, all, the, king, s, courts, across, england, originated, in, the, practices, of, the, courts, of, the, english, kings, in, the, centuries, following, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, england, spread, the, english, legal, system, across, the, british, isles, first, to, wales, and, then, to, ireland, and, overseas, colonies, this, was, continued, by, the, later, british, empire, many, former, colonies, retain, the, common, law, system, today, these, common, law, systems, are, legal, systems, that, give, great, weight, to, judicial, precedent, and, to, the, style, of, reasoning, inherited, from, the, english, legal, system, the, term, common, law, referring, to, the, body, of, law, made, by, the, judiciary, is, often, distinguished, from, statutory, law, and, regulations, which, are, laws, adopted, by, the, legislature, and, executive, respectively, in, legal, systems, that, follow, the, common, law, judicial, precedent, stands, in, contrast, to, and, on, equal, footing, with, statutes, the, other, major, legal, system, used, by, countries, is, the, civil, law, which, codifies, its, legal, principles, into, legal, codes, and, does, not, treat, judicial, opinions, as, binding, today, one, third, of, the, world, s, population, lives, in, common, law, jurisdictions, or, in, mixed, legal, systems, that, combine, the, common, law, with, the, civil, law, including, antigua, and, barbuda, australia, the, bahamas, bangladesh, barbados, belize, botswana, cameroon, canada, both, the, federal, system, and, all, its, provinces, except, quebec, cyprus, dominica, fiji, ghana, grenada, guyana, hong, kong, india, ireland, israel, jamaica, kenya, liberia, malaysia, malta, marshall, islands, micronesia, myanmar, namibia, nauru, new, zealand, nigeria, pakistan, palau, papua, new, guinea, philippines, sierra, leone, singapore, south, africa, sri, lanka, trinidad, and, tobago, the, united, kingdom, including, its, overseas, territories, such, as, gibraltar, the, united, states, both, the, federal, system, and, 49, of, its, 50, states, and, zimbabwe, according, to, black, s, law, dictionary, common, law, is, the, body, of, law, derived, from, judicial, decisions, rather, than, from, statutes, or, constitutions, legal, jurisdictions, that, use, common, law, as, precedent, are, called, common, law, jurisdictions, in, contrast, with, jurisdictions, that, do, not, use, common, law, as, precedent, which, are, called, civil, law, or, code, jurisdictions, until, the, early, 20th, century, common, law, was, widely, considered, to, derive, its, authority, from, ancient, customs, of, the, anglo, saxon, well, into, the, 19th, century, common, law, was, still, defined, as, an, ancient, unwritten, law, in, legal, dictionaries, including, bouvier, s, law, dictionary, and, black, s, law, dictionary, the, term, judge, made, law, was, introduced, by, jeremy, bentham, as, a, criticism, of, this, pretense, of, the, legal, profession, but, acceptance, of, william, blackstone, s, declaratory, theory, of, common, law, was, near, universal, for, centuries, many, notable, writers, eventually, adopted, the, modern, definition, of, common, law, as, case, law, or, ratio, decidendi, that, is, binding, as, precedent, including, a, v, dicey, william, markby, oliver, wendell, holmes, john, austin, roscoe, pound, and, ezra, ripley, thayer, in, a, common, law, jurisdiction, several, stages, of, research, and, analysis, are, required, to, determine, what, the, law, is, in, a, given, situation, first, one, must, ascertain, the, facts, then, one, must, locate, any, relevant, statutes, and, cases, then, one, must, extract, the, principles, analogies, and, statements, by, various, courts, of, what, they, consider, important, to, determine, how, the, next, court, is, likely, to, rule, on, the, facts, of, the, present, case, more, recent, decisions, and, decisions, of, higher, courts, or, legislatures, carry, more, weight, than, earlier, cases, and, those, of, lower, courts, finally, one, integrates, all, the, lines, drawn, and, reasons, given, and, determines, what, the, law, is, then, one, applies, that, law, to, the, facts, in, practice, common, law, systems, are, considerably, more, complicated, than, the, simplified, system, described, above, the, decisions, of, a, court, are, binding, only, in, a, particular, jurisdiction, and, even, within, a, given, jurisdiction, some, courts, have, more, power, than, others, for, example, in, most, jurisdictions, decisions, by, appellate, courts, are, binding, on, lower, courts, in, the, same, jurisdiction, and, on, future, decisions, of, the, same, appellate, court, but, decisions, of, lower, courts, are, only, non, binding, persuasive, authority, interactions, between, common, law, constitutional, law, statutory, law, and, regulatory, law, also, give, rise, to, considerable, complexity, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, cautioned, that, the, proper, derivation, of, general, principles, in, both, common, and, constitutional, law, arise, gradually, in, the, emergence, of, a, consensus, from, a, multitude, of, particularized, prior, decisions, justice, cardozo, noted, the, common, law, does, not, work, from, pre, established, truths, of, universal, and, inflexible, validity, to, conclusions, derived, from, them, deductively, but, ts, method, is, inductive, and, it, draws, its, generalizations, from, particulars, the, common, law, is, more, malleable, than, statutory, law, first, common, law, courts, are, not, absolutely, bound, by, precedent, but, can, when, extraordinarily, good, reason, is, shown, reinterpret, and, revise, the, law, without, legislative, intervention, to, adapt, to, new, trends, in, political, legal, and, social, philosophy, second, the, common, law, evolves, through, a, series, of, gradual, steps, that, gradually, works, out, all, the, details, so, that, over, a, decade, or, more, the, law, can, change, substantially, but, without, a, sharp, break, thereby, reducing, disruptive, effects, in, contrast, to, common, law, incrementalism, the, legislative, process, is, very, difficult, to, get, started, as, the, work, begins, much, earlier, than, just, introducing, a, bill, once, the, legislation, is, introduced, the, process, to, getting, it, passed, is, long, involving, the, committee, system, debate, the, potential, of, conference, committee, voting, and, president, approval, because, of, the, involved, process, many, pieces, must, fall, into, place, in, order, for, it, to, be, passed, one, example, of, the, gradual, change, that, typifies, evolution, of, the, common, law, is, the, gradual, change, in, liability, for, negligence, the, traditional, common, law, rule, through, most, of, the, 19th, century, was, that, a, plaintiff, could, not, recover, for, a, defendant, s, negligent, production, or, distribution, of, a, harmful, instrumentality, unless, the, two, were, parties, to, a, contract, privity, of, contract, thus, only, the, immediate, purchaser, could, recover, for, a, product, defect, and, if, a, part, was, built, up, out, of, parts, from, parts, manufacturers, the, ultimate, buyer, could, not, recover, for, injury, caused, by, a, defect, in, the, part, in, an, 1842, english, case, winterbottom, v, wright, the, postal, service, had, contracted, with, wright, to, maintain, its, coaches, winterbottom, was, a, driver, for, the, post, when, the, coach, failed, and, injured, winterbottom, he, sued, wright, the, winterbottom, court, recognized, that, there, would, be, absurd, and, outrageous, consequences, if, an, injured, person, could, sue, any, person, peripherally, involved, and, knew, it, had, to, draw, a, line, somewhere, a, limit, on, the, causal, connection, between, the, negligent, conduct, and, the, injury, the, court, looked, to, the, contractual, relationships, and, held, that, liability, would, only, flow, as, far, as, the, person, in, immediate, contract, privity, with, the, negligent, party, a, first, exception, to, this, rule, arose, in, 1852, in, the, case, of, thomas, v, winchester, when, new, york, s, highest, court, held, that, mislabeling, a, poison, as, an, innocuous, herb, and, then, selling, the, mislabeled, poison, through, a, dealer, who, would, be, expected, to, resell, it, put, human, life, in, imminent, danger, thomas, relied, on, this, reason, to, create, an, exception, to, the, privity, rule, in, 1909, new, york, held, in, statler, v, ray, mfg, co, that, a, coffee, urn, manufacturer, was, liable, to, a, person, injured, when, the, urn, exploded, because, the, urn, was, of, such, a, character, inherently, that, when, applied, to, the, purposes, for, which, it, was, designed, it, was, liable, to, become, a, source, of, great, danger, to, many, people, if, not, carefully, and, properly, constructed, yet, the, privity, rule, survived, in, cadillac, motor, car, co, v, johnson, decided, in, 1915, by, the, federal, appeals, court, for, new, york, and, several, neighboring, states, the, court, held, that, a, car, owner, could, not, recover, for, injuries, from, a, defective, wheel, when, the, automobile, owner, had, a, contract, only, with, the, automobile, dealer, and, not, with, the, manufacturer, even, though, there, was, no, question, that, the, wheel, was, made, of, dead, and, dozy, wood, quite, insufficient, for, its, purposes, the, cadillac, court, was, willing, to, acknowledge, that, the, case, law, supported, exceptions, for, an, article, dangerous, in, its, nature, or, likely, to, become, so, in, the, course, of, the, ordinary, usage, to, be, contemplated, by, the, vendor, however, held, the, cadillac, court, one, who, manufactures, articles, dangerous, only, if, defectively, made, or, installed, e, g, tables, chairs, pictures, or, mirrors, hung, on, the, walls, carriages, automobiles, and, so, on, is, not, liable, to, third, parties, for, injuries, caused, by, them, except, in, case, of, willful, injury, or, fraud, finally, in, the, famous, case, of, macpherson, v, buick, motor, co, in, 1916, judge, benjamin, cardozo, for, new, york, s, highest, court, pulled, a, broader, principle, out, of, these, predecessor, cases, the, facts, were, almost, identical, to, cadillac, a, year, earlier, a, wheel, from, a, wheel, manufacturer, was, sold, to, buick, to, a, dealer, to, macpherson, and, the, wheel, failed, injuring, macpherson, judge, cardozo, held, it, may, be, that, statler, v, ray, mfg, co, have, extended, the, rule, of, thomas, v, winchester, if, so, this, court, is, committed, to, the, extension, the, defendant, argues, that, things, imminently, dangerous, to, life, are, poisons, explosives, deadly, weapons, things, whose, normal, function, it, is, to, injure, or, destroy, but, whatever, the, rule, in, thomas, v, winchester, may, once, have, been, it, has, no, longer, that, restricted, meaning, a, scaffold, devlin, v, smith, supra, is, not, inherently, a, destructive, instrument, it, becomes, destructive, only, if, imperfectly, constructed, a, large, coffee, urn, statler, v, ray, mfg, co, supra, may, have, within, itself, if, negligently, made, the, potency, of, danger, yet, no, one, thinks, of, it, as, an, implement, whose, normal, function, is, destruction, what, is, true, of, the, coffee, urn, is, equally, true, of, bottles, of, aerated, water, torgesen, v, schultz, 192, n, y, 156, we, have, mentioned, only, cases, in, this, court, but, the, rule, has, received, a, like, extension, in, our, courts, of, intermediate, appeal, in, burke, v, ireland, 26, app, div, 487, in, an, opinion, by, cullen, j, it, was, applied, to, a, builder, who, constructed, a, defective, building, in, kahner, v, otis, elevator, co, 96, app, div, 169, to, the, manufacturer, of, an, elevator, in, davies, v, pelham, hod, elevating, co, 65, hun, 573, affirmed, in, this, court, without, opinion, 146, n, y, 363, to, a, contractor, who, furnished, a, defective, rope, with, knowledge, of, the, purpose, for, which, the, rope, was, to, be, used, we, are, not, required, at, this, time, either, to, approve, or, to, disapprove, the, application, of, the, rule, that, was, made, in, these, cases, it, is, enough, that, they, help, to, characterize, the, trend, of, judicial, thought, we, hold, then, that, the, principle, of, thomas, v, winchester, is, not, limited, to, poisons, explosives, and, things, of, like, nature, to, things, which, in, their, normal, operation, are, implements, of, destruction, if, the, nature, of, a, thing, is, such, that, it, is, reasonably, certain, to, place, life, and, limb, in, peril, when, negligently, made, it, is, then, a, thing, of, danger, its, nature, gives, warning, of, the, consequences, to, be, expected, if, to, the, element, of, danger, there, is, added, knowledge, that, the, thing, will, be, used, by, persons, other, than, the, purchaser, and, used, without, new, tests, then, irrespective, of, contract, the, manufacturer, of, this, thing, of, danger, is, under, a, duty, to, make, it, carefully, there, must, be, knowledge, of, a, danger, not, merely, possible, but, probable, cardozo, s, new, rule, exists, in, no, prior, case, but, is, inferrable, as, a, synthesis, of, the, thing, of, danger, principle, stated, in, them, merely, extending, it, to, foreseeable, danger, even, if, the, purposes, for, which, it, was, designed, were, not, themselves, a, source, of, great, danger, macpherson, takes, some, care, to, present, itself, as, foreseeable, progression, not, a, wild, departure, cardozo, continues, to, adhere, to, the, original, principle, of, winterbottom, that, absurd, and, outrageous, consequences, must, be, avoided, and, he, does, so, by, drawing, a, new, line, in, the, last, sentence, quoted, above, there, must, be, knowledge, of, a, danger, not, merely, possible, but, probable, but, while, adhering, to, the, underlying, principle, that, some, boundary, is, necessary, macpherson, overruled, the, prior, common, law, by, rendering, the, formerly, dominant, factor, in, the, boundary, that, is, the, privity, formality, arising, out, of, a, contractual, relationship, between, persons, totally, irrelevant, rather, the, most, important, factor, in, the, boundary, would, be, the, nature, of, the, thing, sold, and, the, foreseeable, uses, that, downstream, purchasers, would, make, of, the, thing, the, example, of, the, evolution, of, the, law, of, negligence, in, the, preceding, paragraphs, illustrates, two, crucial, principles, a, the, common, law, evolves, this, evolution, is, in, the, hands, of, judges, and, judges, have, made, law, for, hundreds, of, years, b, the, reasons, given, for, a, decision, are, often, more, important, in, the, long, run, than, the, outcome, in, a, particular, case, this, is, the, reason, that, judicial, opinions, are, usually, quite, long, and, give, rationales, and, policies, that, can, be, balanced, with, judgment, in, future, cases, rather, than, the, bright, line, rules, usually, embodied, in, statutes, all, law, systems, rely, on, written, publication, of, the, law, so, that, it, is, accessible, to, all, common, law, decisions, are, published, in, law, reports, for, use, by, lawyers, courts, and, the, general, public, after, the, american, revolution, massachusetts, became, the, first, state, to, establish, an, official, reporter, of, decisions, as, newer, states, needed, law, they, often, looked, first, to, the, massachusetts, reports, for, authoritative, precedents, as, a, basis, for, their, own, common, law, the, united, states, federal, courts, relied, on, private, publishers, until, after, the, civil, war, and, only, began, publishing, as, a, government, function, in, 1874, west, publishing, in, minnesota, is, the, largest, private, sector, publisher, of, law, reports, in, the, united, states, government, publishers, typically, issue, only, decisions, in, the, raw, while, private, sector, publishers, often, add, indexing, including, references, to, the, key, principles, of, the, common, law, involved, editorial, analysis, and, similar, finding, aids, statutes, are, generally, understood, to, supersede, common, law, they, may, codify, existing, common, law, create, new, causes, of, action, that, did, not, exist, in, the, common, law, or, legislatively, overrule, the, common, law, common, law, still, has, practical, applications, in, some, areas, of, law, examples, are, contract, law, and, the, law, of, torts, at, earlier, stages, in, the, development, of, modern, legal, systems, and, government, courts, exercised, their, authority, in, performing, what, roscoe, pound, described, as, an, essentially, legislative, function, as, legislation, became, more, comprehensive, courts, began, to, operate, within, narrower, limits, of, statutory, interpretation, jeremy, bentham, famously, criticized, judicial, lawmaking, when, he, argued, in, favor, of, codification, and, narrow, judicial, decisions, pound, comments, that, critics, of, judicial, lawmaking, are, not, always, consistent, sometimes, siding, with, bentham, and, decrying, judicial, overreach, at, other, times, unsatisfied, with, judicial, reluctance, to, sweep, broadly, and, employ, case, law, as, a, means, to, redress, certain, challenges, to, established, law, oliver, wendell, holmes, once, dissented, judges, do, and, must, legislate, there, is, a, controversial, legal, maxim, in, american, law, that, statutes, in, derogation, of, the, common, law, ought, to, be, narrowly, construed, henry, campbell, black, once, wrote, that, the, canon, no, longer, has, any, foundation, in, reason, it, is, generally, associated, with, the, lochner, era, the, presumption, is, that, legislatures, may, take, away, common, law, rights, but, modern, jurisprudence, will, look, for, the, statutory, purpose, or, legislative, intent, and, apply, rules, of, statutory, construction, like, the, plain, meaning, rule, to, reach, decisions, as, the, united, states, supreme, court, explained, in, united, states, v, texas, 507, u, s, 529, 1993, just, as, longstanding, is, the, principle, that, tatutes, which, invade, the, common, law, are, to, be, read, with, a, presumption, favoring, the, retention, of, long, established, and, familiar, principles, except, when, a, statutory, purpose, to, the, contrary, is, evident, isbrandtsen, co, v, johnson, 343, u, s, 779, 783, 1952, astoria, federal, savings, loan, assn, v, solimino, 501, u, s, 104, 108, 1991, in, such, cases, congress, does, not, write, upon, a, clean, slate, astoria, 501, u, s, at, 108, in, order, to, abrogate, a, common, law, principle, the, statute, must, speak, directly, to, the, question, addressed, by, the, common, law, mobil, oil, corp, v, higginbotham, 436, u, s, 618, 625, 1978, milwaukee, v, illinois, 451, u, s, 304, 315, 1981, as, another, example, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, in, 1877, held, that, a, michigan, statute, that, established, rules, for, solemnization, of, marriages, did, not, abolish, pre, existing, common, law, marriage, because, the, statute, did, not, affirmatively, require, statutory, solemnization, and, was, silent, as, to, preexisting, common, law, court, decisions, that, analyze, interpret, and, determine, the, fine, boundaries, and, distinctions, in, law, promulgated, by, other, bodies, are, sometimes, called, interstitial, common, law, which, includes, judicial, interpretation, of, fundamental, laws, such, as, the, us, constitution, of, legislative, statutes, and, of, agency, regulations, and, the, application, of, law, to, specific, facts, the, united, states, federal, courts, are, divided, into, twelve, regional, circuits, each, with, a, circuit, court, of, appeals, plus, a, thirteenth, the, court, of, appeals, for, the, federal, circuit, which, hears, appeals, in, patent, cases, and, cases, against, the, federal, government, without, geographic, limitation, decisions, of, one, circuit, court, are, binding, on, the, district, courts, within, the, circuit, and, on, the, circuit, court, itself, but, are, only, persuasive, authority, on, sister, circuits, district, court, decisions, are, not, binding, precedent, at, all, only, persuasive, most, of, the, u, s, federal, courts, of, appeal, have, adopted, a, rule, under, which, in, the, event, of, any, conflict, in, decisions, of, panels, most, of, the, courts, of, appeal, almost, always, sit, in, panels, of, three, the, earlier, panel, decision, is, controlling, and, a, panel, decision, may, only, be, overruled, by, the, court, of, appeals, sitting, en, banc, that, is, all, active, judges, of, the, court, or, by, a, higher, court, in, these, courts, the, older, decision, remains, controlling, when, an, issue, comes, up, the, third, time, other, courts, for, example, the, court, of, appeals, for, the, federal, circuit, formerly, known, as, court, of, customs, and, patent, appeals, and, the, us, supreme, court, always, sit, en, banc, and, thus, the, later, decision, controls, these, courts, essentially, overrule, all, previous, cases, in, each, new, case, and, older, cases, survive, only, to, the, extent, they, do, not, conflict, with, newer, cases, the, interpretations, of, these, courts, for, example, supreme, court, interpretations, of, the, constitution, or, federal, statutes, are, stable, only, so, long, as, the, older, interpretation, maintains, the, support, of, a, majority, of, the, court, older, decisions, persist, through, some, combination, of, belief, that, the, old, decision, is, right, and, that, it, is, not, sufficiently, wrong, to, be, overruled, in, the, jurisdictions, of, england, and, wales, and, of, northern, ireland, since, 2009, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, kingdom, has, the, authority, to, overrule, and, unify, criminal, law, decisions, of, lower, courts, it, is, the, final, court, of, appeal, for, civil, law, cases, in, all, three, of, the, uk, jurisdictions, but, not, for, criminal, law, cases, in, scotland, where, the, high, court, of, justiciary, has, this, power, instead, except, on, questions, of, law, relating, to, reserved, matters, such, as, devolution, and, human, rights, from, 1966, to, 2009, this, power, lay, with, the, house, of, lords, granted, by, the, practice, statement, of, 1966, canada, s, federal, system, described, below, avoids, regional, variability, of, federal, law, by, giving, national, jurisdiction, to, both, layers, of, appellate, courts, the, reliance, on, judicial, opinion, is, a, strength, of, common, law, systems, and, is, a, significant, contributor, to, the, robust, commercial, systems, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, because, there, is, reasonably, precise, guidance, on, almost, every, issue, parties, especially, commercial, parties, can, predict, whether, a, proposed, course, of, action, is, likely, to, be, lawful, or, unlawful, and, have, some, assurance, of, consistency, as, justice, brandeis, famously, expressed, it, in, most, matters, it, is, more, important, that, the, applicable, rule, of, law, be, settled, than, that, it, be, settled, right, this, ability, to, predict, gives, more, freedom, to, come, close, to, the, boundaries, of, the, law, for, example, many, commercial, contracts, are, more, economically, efficient, and, create, greater, wealth, because, the, parties, know, ahead, of, time, that, the, proposed, arrangement, though, perhaps, close, to, the, line, is, almost, certainly, legal, newspapers, taxpayer, funded, entities, with, some, religious, affiliation, and, political, parties, can, obtain, fairly, clear, guidance, on, the, boundaries, within, which, their, freedom, of, expression, rights, apply, in, contrast, in, jurisdictions, with, very, weak, respect, for, precedent, fine, questions, of, law, are, redetermined, anew, each, time, they, arise, making, consistency, and, prediction, more, difficult, and, procedures, far, more, protracted, than, necessary, because, parties, cannot, rely, on, written, statements, of, law, as, reliable, guides, in, jurisdictions, that, do, not, have, a, strong, allegiance, to, a, large, body, of, precedent, parties, have, less, a, priori, guidance, unless, the, written, law, is, very, clear, and, kept, updated, and, must, often, leave, a, bigger, safety, margin, of, unexploited, opportunities, and, final, determinations, are, reached, only, after, far, larger, expenditures, on, legal, fees, by, the, parties, this, is, the, reason, for, the, frequent, choice, of, the, law, of, the, state, of, new, york, in, commercial, contracts, even, when, neither, entity, has, extensive, contacts, with, new, york, and, remarkably, often, even, when, neither, party, has, contacts, with, the, united, states, commercial, contracts, almost, always, include, a, choice, of, law, clause, to, reduce, uncertainty, somewhat, surprisingly, contracts, throughout, the, world, for, example, contracts, involving, parties, in, japan, france, and, germany, and, from, most, of, the, other, states, of, the, united, states, often, choose, the, law, of, new, york, even, where, the, relationship, of, the, parties, and, transaction, to, new, york, is, quite, attenuated, because, of, its, history, as, the, united, states, commercial, center, new, york, common, law, has, a, depth, and, predictability, not, yet, available, in, any, other, jurisdictions, of, the, united, states, similarly, american, corporations, are, often, formed, under, delaware, corporate, law, and, american, contracts, relating, to, corporate, law, issues, merger, and, acquisitions, of, companies, rights, of, shareholders, and, so, on, include, a, delaware, choice, of, law, clause, because, of, the, deep, body, of, law, in, delaware, on, these, issues, on, the, other, hand, some, other, jurisdictions, have, sufficiently, developed, bodies, of, law, so, that, parties, have, no, real, motivation, to, choose, the, law, of, a, foreign, jurisdiction, for, example, england, and, wales, and, the, state, of, california, but, not, yet, so, fully, developed, that, parties, with, no, relationship, to, the, jurisdiction, choose, that, law, outside, the, united, states, parties, that, are, in, different, jurisdictions, from, each, other, often, choose, the, law, of, england, and, wales, particularly, when, the, parties, are, each, in, former, british, colonies, and, members, of, the, commonwealth, the, common, theme, in, all, cases, is, that, commercial, parties, seek, predictability, and, simplicity, in, their, contractual, relations, and, frequently, choose, the, law, of, a, common, law, jurisdiction, with, a, well, developed, body, of, common, law, to, achieve, that, result, likewise, for, litigation, of, commercial, disputes, arising, out, of, unpredictable, torts, as, opposed, to, the, prospective, choice, of, law, clauses, in, contracts, discussed, in, the, previous, paragraph, certain, jurisdictions, attract, an, unusually, high, fraction, of, cases, because, of, the, predictability, afforded, by, the, depth, of, decided, cases, for, example, london, is, considered, the, pre, eminent, centre, for, litigation, of, admiralty, cases, this, is, not, to, say, that, common, law, is, better, in, every, situation, for, example, civil, law, can, be, clearer, than, case, law, when, the, legislature, has, had, the, foresight, and, diligence, to, address, the, precise, set, of, facts, applicable, to, a, particular, situation, for, that, reason, civil, law, statutes, tend, to, be, somewhat, more, detailed, than, statutes, written, by, common, law, legislatures, but, conversely, that, tends, to, make, the, statute, more, difficult, to, read, the, common, law, so, named, because, it, was, common, to, all, the, king, s, courts, across, england, originated, in, the, practices, of, the, courts, of, the, english, kings, in, the, centuries, following, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, prior, to, the, norman, conquest, much, of, england, s, legal, business, took, place, in, the, local, folk, courts, of, its, various, shires, and, hundreds, a, variety, of, other, individual, courts, also, existed, across, the, land, urban, boroughs, and, merchant, fairs, held, their, own, courts, and, large, landholders, also, held, their, own, manorial, and, seigniorial, courts, as, needed, the, degree, to, which, common, law, drew, from, earlier, anglo, saxon, traditions, such, as, the, jury, ordeals, the, penalty, of, outlawry, and, writs, all, of, which, were, incorporated, into, the, norman, common, law, is, still, a, subject, of, much, discussion, additionally, the, catholic, church, operated, its, own, court, system, that, adjudicated, issues, of, canon, law, the, main, sources, for, the, history, of, the, common, law, in, the, middle, ages, are, the, plea, rolls, and, the, year, books, the, plea, rolls, which, were, the, official, court, records, for, the, courts, of, common, pleas, and, king, s, bench, were, written, in, latin, the, rolls, were, made, up, in, bundles, by, law, term, hilary, easter, trinity, and, michaelmas, or, winter, spring, summer, and, autumn, they, are, currently, deposited, in, the, uk, national, archives, by, whose, permission, images, of, the, rolls, for, the, courts, of, common, pleas, king, s, bench, and, exchequer, of, pleas, from, the, 13th, century, to, the, 17th, can, be, viewed, online, at, the, anglo, american, legal, tradition, site, the, o, quinn, law, library, of, the, university, of, houston, law, center, the, doctrine, of, precedent, developed, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, as, the, collective, judicial, decisions, that, were, based, in, tradition, custom, and, precedent, the, form, of, reasoning, used, in, common, law, is, known, as, casuistry, or, case, based, reasoning, the, common, law, as, applied, in, civil, cases, as, distinct, from, criminal, cases, was, devised, as, a, means, of, compensating, someone, for, wrongful, acts, known, as, torts, including, both, intentional, torts, and, torts, caused, by, negligence, and, as, developing, the, body, of, law, recognizing, and, regulating, contracts, the, type, of, procedure, practiced, in, common, law, courts, is, known, as, the, adversarial, system, this, is, also, a, development, of, the, common, law, in, 1154, henry, ii, became, the, first, plantagenet, king, among, many, achievements, henry, institutionalized, common, law, by, creating, a, unified, system, of, law, common, to, the, country, through, incorporating, and, elevating, local, custom, to, the, national, ending, local, control, and, peculiarities, eliminating, arbitrary, remedies, and, reinstating, a, jury, system, citizens, sworn, on, oath, to, investigate, reliable, criminal, accusations, and, civil, claims, the, jury, reached, its, verdict, through, evaluating, common, local, knowledge, not, necessarily, through, the, presentation, of, evidence, a, distinguishing, factor, from, today, s, civil, and, criminal, court, systems, at, the, time, royal, government, centered, on, the, curia, regis, king, s, court, the, body, of, aristocrats, and, prelates, who, assisted, in, the, administration, of, the, realm, and, the, ancestor, of, parliament, the, star, chamber, and, privy, council, henry, ii, developed, the, practice, of, sending, judges, numbering, around, 20, to, 30, in, the, 1180s, from, his, curia, regis, to, hear, the, various, disputes, throughout, the, country, and, return, to, the, court, thereafter, the, king, s, itinerant, justices, would, generally, receive, a, writ, or, commission, under, the, great, seal, they, would, then, resolve, disputes, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, according, to, what, they, interpreted, the, customs, to, be, the, king, s, judges, would, then, return, to, london, and, often, discuss, their, cases, and, the, decisions, they, made, with, the, other, judges, these, decisions, would, be, recorded, and, filed, in, time, a, rule, known, as, stare, decisis, also, commonly, known, as, precedent, developed, whereby, a, judge, would, be, bound, to, follow, the, decision, of, an, earlier, judge, he, was, required, to, adopt, the, earlier, judge, s, interpretation, of, the, law, and, apply, the, same, principles, promulgated, by, that, earlier, judge, if, the, two, cases, had, similar, facts, to, one, another, once, judges, began, to, regard, each, other, s, decisions, to, be, binding, precedent, the, pre, norman, system, of, local, customs, and, law, varying, in, each, locality, was, replaced, by, a, system, that, was, at, least, in, theory, though, not, always, in, practice, common, throughout, the, whole, country, hence, the, name, common, law, the, king, s, object, was, to, preserve, public, order, but, providing, law, and, order, was, also, extremely, profitable, cases, on, forest, use, as, well, as, fines, and, forfeitures, can, generate, great, treasure, for, the, government, eyres, a, norman, french, word, for, judicial, circuit, originating, from, latin, iter, are, more, than, just, courts, they, would, supervise, local, government, raise, revenue, investigate, crimes, and, enforce, feudal, rights, of, the, king, there, were, complaints, of, the, eyre, of, 1198, reducing, the, kingdom, to, poverty, and, cornishmen, fleeing, to, escape, the, eyre, of, 1233, henry, ii, s, creation, of, a, powerful, and, unified, court, system, which, curbed, somewhat, the, power, of, canonical, church, courts, brought, him, and, england, into, conflict, with, the, church, most, famously, with, thomas, becket, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, the, murder, of, the, archbishop, gave, rise, to, a, wave, of, popular, outrage, against, the, king, international, pressure, on, henry, grew, and, in, may, 1172, he, negotiated, a, settlement, with, the, papacy, in, which, the, king, swore, to, go, on, crusade, as, well, as, effectively, overturned, the, more, controversial, clauses, of, the, constitutions, of, clarendon, henry, nevertheless, continued, to, exert, influence, in, any, ecclesiastical, case, which, interested, him, and, royal, power, was, exercised, more, subtly, with, considerable, success, the, english, court, of, common, pleas, was, established, after, magna, carta, to, try, lawsuits, between, commoners, in, which, the, monarch, had, no, interest, its, judges, sat, in, open, court, in, the, great, hall, of, the, king, s, palace, of, westminster, permanently, except, in, the, vacations, between, the, four, terms, of, the, legal, year, judge, made, common, law, operated, as, the, primary, source, of, law, for, several, hundred, years, before, parliament, acquired, legislative, powers, to, create, statutory, law, in, england, judges, have, devised, a, number, of, rules, as, to, how, to, deal, with, precedent, decisions, the, early, development, of, case, law, in, the, thirteenth, century, has, been, traced, to, bracton, s, on, the, laws, and, customs, of, england, and, led, to, the, yearly, compilations, of, court, cases, known, as, year, books, of, which, the, first, extant, was, published, in, 1268, the, same, year, that, bracton, died, the, year, books, are, known, as, the, law, reports, of, medieval, england, and, are, a, principal, source, for, knowledge, of, the, developing, legal, doctrines, concepts, and, methods, in, the, period, from, the, 13th, to, the, 16th, centuries, when, the, common, law, developed, into, recognizable, form, the, term, common, law, is, often, used, as, a, contrast, to, roman, derived, civil, law, and, the, fundamental, processes, and, forms, of, reasoning, in, the, two, are, quite, different, nonetheless, there, has, been, considerable, cross, fertilization, of, ideas, while, the, two, traditions, and, sets, of, foundational, principles, remain, distinct, by, the, time, of, the, rediscovery, of, the, roman, law, in, europe, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, common, law, had, already, developed, far, enough, to, prevent, a, roman, law, reception, as, it, occurred, on, the, continent, however, the, first, common, law, scholars, most, notably, glanvill, and, bracton, as, well, as, the, early, royal, common, law, judges, had, been, well, accustomed, with, roman, law, often, they, were, clerics, trained, in, the, roman, canon, law, one, of, the, first, and, throughout, its, history, one, of, the, most, significant, treatises, of, the, common, law, bracton, s, de, legibus, et, consuetudinibus, angliae, on, the, laws, and, customs, of, england, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, division, of, the, law, in, justinian, s, institutes, the, impact, of, roman, law, had, decreased, sharply, after, the, age, of, bracton, but, the, roman, divisions, of, actions, into, in, rem, typically, actions, against, a, thing, or, property, for, the, purpose, of, gaining, title, to, that, property, must, be, filed, in, a, court, where, the, property, is, located, and, in, personam, typically, actions, directed, against, a, person, these, can, affect, a, person, s, rights, and, since, a, person, often, owns, things, his, property, too, used, by, bracton, had, a, lasting, effect, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, a, return, of, roman, law, structural, concepts, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, signs, of, this, can, be, found, in, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, and, roman, law, ideas, regained, importance, with, the, revival, of, academic, law, schools, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, result, today, the, main, systematic, divisions, of, the, law, into, property, contract, and, tort, and, to, some, extent, unjust, enrichment, can, be, found, in, the, civil, law, as, well, as, in, the, common, law, the, ancient, unwritten, universal, custom, view, was, the, foundation, of, the, first, treatises, by, blackstone, and, coke, and, was, universal, among, lawyers, and, judges, from, the, earliest, times, to, the, mid, 19th, century, however, for, 100, years, lawyers, and, judges, have, recognized, that, the, ancient, unwritten, universal, custom, view, does, not, accord, with, the, facts, of, the, origin, and, growth, of, the, law, west, s, encyclopedia, of, american, law, defines, common, law, as, the, ancient, law, of, england, based, upon, societal, customs, and, recognized, and, enforced, by, the, judgments, and, decrees, of, the, courts, the, first, attempt, at, a, comprehensive, compilation, of, centuries, of, common, law, was, by, lord, chief, justice, edward, coke, in, his, treatise, institutes, of, the, lawes, of, england, in, the, 17th, century, as, sir, edward, coke, 1552, 1634, put, it, in, the, preface, to, the, eighth, volume, of, his, reports, 1600, 1615, the, grounds, of, our, common, laws, were, beyond, the, memorie, or, register, of, any, beginning, according, to, william, blackstone, the, unwritten, law, derived, its, authority, from, immemorial, usage, and, universal, reception, throughout, the, kingdom, while, its, precise, meaning, may, have, changed, since, blackstone, s, time, in, modern, usage, it, is, generally, understood, to, mean, law, that, is, independent, of, statutes, this, was, repeated, by, the, united, states, supreme, court, in, levy, v, mccartee, it, is, too, plain, for, argument, that, the, common, law, is, here, spoken, of, in, its, appropriate, sense, as, the, unwritten, law, of, the, land, independent, of, statutory, enactments, more, specifically, in, modern, usage, this, is, understood, to, mean, law, that, is, made, by, judges, not, the, declaratory, statutes, of, blackstone, s, era, the, term, judge, made, law, comes, from, jeremy, bentham, and, the, modern, practice, of, adjudication, as, application, of, precedent, derived, from, case, law, begins, with, jeremy, bentham, s, attack, on, the, legitimacy, of, the, common, law, the, modern, legal, practice, of, applying, case, law, as, precedent, made, obsolete, the, declaratory, theory, of, common, law, that, prevailed, in, blackstone, s, time, a, reception, statute, is, a, statutory, law, adopted, as, a, former, british, colony, becomes, independent, by, which, the, new, nation, adopts, i, e, receives, pre, independence, common, law, to, the, extent, not, explicitly, rejected, by, the, legislative, body, or, constitution, of, the, new, nation, reception, statutes, generally, consider, the, english, common, law, dating, prior, to, independence, and, the, precedent, originating, from, it, as, the, default, law, because, of, the, importance, of, using, an, extensive, and, predictable, body, of, law, to, govern, the, conduct, of, citizens, and, businesses, in, a, new, state, all, u, s, states, with, the, partial, exception, of, louisiana, have, either, implemented, reception, statutes, or, adopted, the, common, law, by, judicial, opinion, other, examples, of, reception, statutes, in, the, united, states, the, states, of, the, u, s, canada, and, its, provinces, and, hong, kong, are, discussed, in, the, reception, statute, article, yet, adoption, of, the, common, law, in, the, newly, independent, united, states, was, not, a, foregone, conclusion, and, was, controversial, immediately, after, the, american, revolution, there, was, widespread, distrust, and, hostility, to, anything, british, and, the, common, law, was, no, exception, jeffersonians, decried, lawyers, and, their, common, law, tradition, as, threats, to, the, new, republic, the, jeffersonians, preferred, a, legislatively, enacted, civil, law, under, the, control, of, the, political, process, rather, than, the, common, law, developed, by, judges, that, by, design, were, insulated, from, the, political, process, the, federalists, believed, that, the, common, law, was, the, birthright, of, independence, after, all, the, natural, rights, to, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, were, the, rights, protected, by, common, law, even, advocates, for, the, common, law, approach, noted, that, it, was, not, an, ideal, fit, for, the, newly, independent, colonies, judges, and, lawyers, alike, were, severely, hindered, by, a, lack, of, printed, legal, materials, before, independence, the, most, comprehensive, law, libraries, had, been, maintained, by, tory, lawyers, and, those, libraries, vanished, with, the, loyalist, expatriation, and, the, ability, to, print, books, was, limited, lawyer, later, president, john, adams, complained, that, he, suffered, very, much, for, the, want, of, books, to, bootstrap, this, most, basic, need, of, a, common, law, system, knowable, written, law, in, 1803, lawyers, in, massachusetts, donated, their, books, to, found, a, law, library, a, jeffersonian, newspaper, criticized, the, library, as, it, would, carry, forward, all, the, old, authorities, practiced, in, england, for, centuries, back, whereby, a, new, system, of, jurisprudence, on, the, high, monarchical, system, become, the, common, law, of, this, commonwealth, may, hereafter, have, a, very, unsocial, purpose, for, several, decades, after, independence, english, law, still, exerted, influence, over, american, common, law, for, example, with, byrne, v, boadle, 1863, which, first, applied, the, res, ipsa, loquitur, doctrine, well, into, the, 19th, century, ancient, maxims, played, a, large, role, in, common, law, adjudication, many, of, these, maxims, had, originated, in, roman, law, migrated, to, england, before, the, introduction, of, christianity, to, the, british, isles, and, were, typically, stated, in, latin, even, in, english, decisions, many, examples, are, familiar, in, everyday, speech, even, today, one, cannot, be, a, judge, in, one, s, own, cause, see, dr, bonham, s, case, rights, are, reciprocal, to, obligations, and, the, like, judicial, decisions, and, treatises, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, such, as, those, of, lord, chief, justice, edward, coke, presented, the, common, law, as, a, collection, of, such, maxims, reliance, on, old, maxims, and, rigid, adherence, to, precedent, no, matter, how, old, or, ill, considered, came, under, critical, discussion, in, the, late, 19th, century, starting, in, the, united, states, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, in, his, famous, article, the, path, of, the, law, commented, it, is, revolting, to, have, no, better, reason, for, a, rule, of, law, than, that, so, it, was, laid, down, in, the, time, of, henry, iv, it, is, still, more, revolting, if, the, grounds, upon, which, it, was, laid, down, have, vanished, long, since, and, the, rule, simply, persists, from, blind, imitation, of, the, past, justice, holmes, noted, that, study, of, maxims, might, be, sufficient, for, the, man, of, the, present, but, the, man, of, the, future, is, the, man, of, statistics, and, the, master, of, economics, in, an, 1880, lecture, at, harvard, he, wrote, the, life, of, the, law, has, not, been, logic, it, has, been, experience, the, felt, necessities, of, the, time, the, prevalent, moral, and, political, theories, intuitions, of, public, policy, avowed, or, unconscious, even, the, prejudices, which, judges, share, with, their, fellow, men, have, had, a, good, deal, more, to, do, than, the, syllogism, in, determining, the, rules, by, which, men, should, be, governed, the, law, embodies, the, story, of, a, nation, s, development, through, many, centuries, and, it, cannot, be, dealt, with, as, if, it, contained, only, the, axioms, and, corollaries, of, a, book, of, mathematics, in, the, early, 20th, century, louis, brandeis, later, appointed, to, the, united, states, supreme, court, became, noted, for, his, use, of, policy, driving, facts, and, economics, in, his, briefs, and, extensive, appendices, presenting, facts, that, lead, a, judge, to, the, advocate, s, conclusion, by, this, time, briefs, relied, more, on, facts, than, on, latin, maxims, reliance, on, old, maxims, is, now, deprecated, common, law, decisions, today, reflect, both, precedent, and, policy, judgment, drawn, from, economics, the, social, sciences, business, decisions, of, foreign, courts, and, the, like, the, degree, to, which, these, external, factors, should, influence, adjudication, is, the, subject, of, active, debate, but, it, is, indisputable, that, judges, do, draw, on, experience, and, learning, from, everyday, life, from, other, fields, and, from, other, jurisdictions, as, early, as, the, 15th, century, it, became, the, practice, that, litigants, who, felt, they, had, been, cheated, by, the, common, law, system, would, petition, the, king, in, person, for, example, they, might, argue, that, an, award, of, damages, at, common, law, as, opposed, to, equity, was, not, sufficient, redress, for, a, trespasser, occupying, their, land, and, instead, request, that, the, trespasser, be, evicted, from, this, developed, the, system, of, equity, administered, by, the, lord, chancellor, in, the, courts, of, chancery, by, their, nature, equity, and, law, were, frequently, in, conflict, and, litigation, would, frequently, continue, for, years, as, one, court, countermanded, the, other, even, though, it, was, established, by, the, 17th, century, that, equity, should, prevail, in, england, courts, of, law, as, opposed, to, equity, were, merged, with, courts, of, equity, by, the, judicature, acts, of, 1873, and, 1875, with, equity, prevailing, in, case, of, conflict, in, the, united, states, parallel, systems, of, law, providing, money, damages, with, cases, heard, by, a, jury, upon, either, party, s, request, and, equity, fashioning, a, remedy, to, fit, the, situation, including, injunctive, relief, heard, by, a, judge, survived, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, united, states, federal, courts, procedurally, separated, law, and, equity, the, same, judges, could, hear, either, kind, of, case, but, a, given, case, could, only, pursue, causes, in, law, or, in, equity, and, the, two, kinds, of, cases, proceeded, under, different, procedural, rules, this, became, problematic, when, a, given, case, required, both, money, damages, and, injunctive, relief, in, 1937, the, new, federal, rules, of, civil, procedure, combined, law, and, equity, into, one, form, of, action, the, civil, action, fed, r, civ, p, 2, the, distinction, survives, to, the, extent, that, issues, that, were, common, law, as, opposed, to, equity, as, of, 1791, the, date, of, adoption, of, the, seventh, amendment, are, still, subject, to, the, right, of, either, party, to, request, a, jury, and, equity, issues, are, decided, by, a, judge, the, states, of, delaware, illinois, mississippi, south, carolina, and, tennessee, continue, to, have, divided, courts, of, law, and, courts, of, chancery, for, example, the, delaware, court, of, chancery, in, new, jersey, the, appellate, courts, are, unified, but, the, trial, courts, are, organized, into, a, chancery, division, and, a, law, division, for, centuries, through, to, the, 19th, century, the, common, law, acknowledged, only, specific, forms, of, action, and, required, very, careful, drafting, of, the, opening, pleading, called, a, writ, to, slot, into, exactly, one, of, them, debt, detinue, covenant, special, assumpsit, general, assumpsit, trespass, trover, replevin, case, or, trespass, on, the, case, and, ejectment, to, initiate, a, lawsuit, a, pleading, had, to, be, drafted, to, meet, myriad, technical, requirements, correctly, categorizing, the, case, into, the, correct, legal, pigeonhole, pleading, in, the, alternative, was, not, permitted, and, using, specific, legal, terms, and, phrases, that, had, been, traditional, for, centuries, under, the, old, common, law, pleading, standards, a, suit, by, a, pro, se, for, oneself, without, a, lawyer, party, was, all, but, impossible, and, there, was, often, considerable, procedural, jousting, at, the, outset, of, a, case, over, minor, wording, issues, one, of, the, major, reforms, of, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, was, the, abolition, of, common, law, pleading, requirements, a, plaintiff, can, initiate, a, case, by, giving, the, defendant, a, short, and, plain, statement, of, facts, that, constitute, an, alleged, wrong, this, reform, moved, the, attention, of, courts, from, technical, scrutiny, of, words, to, a, more, rational, consideration, of, the, facts, and, opened, access, to, justice, far, more, broadly, common, law, is, usually, contrasted, with, the, civil, law, system, which, is, used, in, continental, europe, most, of, central, and, south, america, and, some, african, countries, including, egypt, and, the, francophone, countries, of, the, maghreb, and, west, africa, common, law, systems, trace, their, history, to, the, english, common, law, while, civil, law, systems, trace, their, history, through, the, napoleonic, code, back, to, the, corpus, juris, civilis, of, roman, law, the, primary, contrast, between, the, two, systems, is, the, role, of, written, decisions, and, precedent, as, a, source, of, law, one, of, the, defining, features, of, common, law, legal, systems, while, common, law, systems, place, great, weight, on, precedent, civil, law, judges, tend, to, give, less, weight, to, judicial, precedent, for, example, the, napoleonic, code, expressly, forbade, french, judges, to, pronounce, general, principles, of, law, in, some, civil, law, jurisdictions, the, judiciary, does, not, have, the, authority, to, invalidate, legislative, provisions, for, example, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, the, armenian, parliament, with, substantial, support, from, usaid, adopted, new, legal, codes, some, of, the, codes, introduced, problems, which, the, judiciary, was, not, empowered, to, adjudicate, under, the, established, principles, of, the, common, law, of, contracts, they, could, only, apply, the, code, as, written, there, is, no, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, in, the, french, civil, law, tradition, civil, law, codes, must, be, changed, constantly, because, the, precedent, of, courts, is, not, binding, and, because, courts, lack, authority, to, act, if, there, is, no, statute, there, are, regular, good, quality, law, reports, in, france, but, it, is, not, a, consistent, practice, in, many, of, the, existing, civil, law, jurisdictions, in, french, speaking, colonial, africa, there, were, no, law, reports, and, what, little, we, know, of, those, historical, cases, comes, from, publication, in, journals, common, law, systems, tend, to, give, more, weight, to, separation, of, powers, between, the, judicial, branch, and, the, executive, branch, in, contrast, civil, law, systems, are, typically, more, tolerant, of, allowing, individual, officials, to, exercise, both, powers, one, example, of, this, contrast, is, the, difference, between, the, two, systems, in, allocation, of, responsibility, between, prosecutor, and, adjudicator, common, law, courts, usually, use, an, adversarial, system, in, which, two, sides, present, their, cases, to, a, neutral, judge, for, example, in, criminal, cases, in, adversarial, systems, the, prosecutor, and, adjudicator, are, two, separate, people, the, prosecutor, is, lodged, in, the, executive, branch, and, conducts, the, investigation, to, locate, evidence, that, prosecutor, presents, the, evidence, to, a, neutral, adjudicator, who, makes, a, decision, in, contrast, in, civil, law, systems, criminal, proceedings, proceed, under, an, inquisitorial, system, in, which, an, examining, magistrate, serves, two, roles, by, first, developing, the, evidence, and, arguments, for, one, side, and, then, the, other, during, the, investigation, phase, the, examining, magistrate, then, presents, the, dossier, detailing, his, or, her, findings, to, the, president, of, the, bench, that, will, adjudicate, on, the, case, where, it, has, been, decided, that, a, trial, shall, be, conducted, therefore, the, president, of, the, bench, s, view, of, the, case, is, not, neutral, and, may, be, biased, while, conducting, the, trial, after, the, reading, of, the, dossier, unlike, the, common, law, proceedings, the, president, of, the, bench, in, the, inquisitorial, system, is, not, merely, an, umpire, and, is, entitled, to, directly, interview, the, witnesses, or, express, comments, during, the, trial, as, long, as, he, or, she, does, not, express, his, or, her, view, on, the, guilt, of, the, accused, the, proceeding, in, the, inquisitorial, system, is, essentially, by, writing, most, of, the, witnesses, would, have, given, evidence, in, the, investigation, phase, and, such, evidence, will, be, contained, in, the, dossier, under, the, form, of, police, reports, in, the, same, way, the, accused, would, have, already, put, his, or, her, case, at, the, investigation, phase, but, he, or, she, will, be, free, to, change, his, or, her, evidence, at, trial, whether, the, accused, pleads, guilty, or, not, a, trial, will, be, conducted, unlike, the, adversarial, system, the, conviction, and, sentence, to, be, served, if, any, will, be, released, by, the, trial, jury, together, with, the, president, of, the, trial, bench, following, their, common, deliberation, in, contrast, in, an, adversarial, system, on, issues, of, fact, the, onus, of, framing, the, case, rests, on, the, parties, and, judges, generally, decide, the, case, presented, to, them, rather, than, acting, as, active, investigators, or, actively, reframing, the, issues, presented, in, our, adversary, system, in, both, civil, and, criminal, cases, in, the, first, instance, and, on, appeal, we, follow, the, principle, of, party, presentation, that, is, we, rely, on, the, parties, to, frame, the, issues, for, decision, and, assign, to, courts, the, role, of, neutral, arbiter, of, matters, the, parties, present, this, principle, applies, with, force, in, all, issues, in, criminal, matters, and, to, factual, issues, courts, seldom, engage, in, fact, gathering, on, their, own, initiative, but, decide, facts, on, the, evidence, presented, even, here, there, are, exceptions, for, legislative, facts, as, opposed, to, adjudicative, facts, on, the, other, hand, on, issues, of, law, common, law, courts, regularly, raise, new, issues, such, as, matters, of, jurisdiction, or, standing, perform, independent, research, and, reformulate, the, legal, grounds, on, which, to, analyze, the, facts, presented, to, them, the, united, states, supreme, court, regularly, decides, based, on, issues, raised, only, in, amicus, briefs, from, non, parties, one, of, the, most, notable, such, cases, was, erie, railroad, v, tompkins, a, 1938, case, in, which, neither, party, questioned, the, ruling, from, the, 1842, case, swift, v, tyson, that, served, as, the, foundation, for, their, arguments, but, which, led, the, supreme, court, to, overturn, swift, during, their, deliberations, to, avoid, lack, of, notice, courts, may, invite, briefing, on, an, issue, to, ensure, adequate, notice, however, there, are, limits, an, appeals, court, may, not, introduce, a, theory, that, contradicts, the, party, s, own, contentions, there, are, many, exceptions, in, both, directions, for, example, most, proceedings, before, u, s, federal, and, state, agencies, are, inquisitorial, in, nature, at, least, the, initial, stages, e, g, a, patent, examiner, a, social, security, hearing, officer, and, so, on, even, though, the, law, to, be, applied, is, developed, through, common, law, processes, the, contrast, between, civil, law, and, common, law, legal, systems, has, become, increasingly, blurred, with, the, growing, importance, of, jurisprudence, similar, to, case, law, but, not, binding, in, civil, law, countries, and, the, growing, importance, of, statute, law, and, codes, in, common, law, countries, examples, of, common, law, being, replaced, by, statute, or, codified, rule, in, the, united, states, include, criminal, law, since, 1812, u, s, federal, courts, and, most, but, not, all, of, the, states, have, held, that, criminal, law, must, be, embodied, in, statute, if, the, public, is, to, have, fair, notice, commercial, law, the, uniform, commercial, code, in, the, early, 1960s, and, procedure, the, federal, rules, of, civil, procedure, in, the, 1930s, and, the, federal, rules, of, evidence, in, the, 1970s, but, in, each, case, the, statute, sets, the, general, principles, but, the, interstitial, common, law, process, determines, the, scope, and, application, of, the, statute, an, example, of, convergence, from, the, other, direction, is, shown, in, the, 1982, decision, srl, cilfit, and, lanificio, di, gavardo, spa, v, ministry, of, health, ecli, eu, c, 1982, 335, in, which, the, european, court, of, justice, held, that, questions, it, has, already, answered, need, not, be, resubmitted, this, showed, how, a, historically, distinctly, common, law, principle, is, used, by, a, court, composed, of, judges, at, that, time, of, essentially, civil, law, jurisdiction, the, common, law, constitutes, the, basis, of, the, legal, systems, of, and, many, other, generally, english, speaking, countries, or, commonwealth, countries, except, scotland, which, is, bijuridicial, and, malta, essentially, every, country, that, was, colonised, at, some, time, by, england, great, britain, or, the, united, kingdom, uses, common, law, except, those, that, were, formerly, colonised, by, other, nations, such, as, quebec, which, follows, the, bijuridicial, law, or, civil, code, of, france, in, part, south, africa, and, sri, lanka, which, follow, roman, dutch, law, where, the, prior, civil, law, system, was, retained, to, respect, the, civil, rights, of, the, local, colonists, guyana, and, saint, lucia, have, mixed, common, law, and, civil, law, systems, the, remainder, of, this, section, discusses, jurisdiction, specific, variants, arranged, chronologically, scotland, is, often, said, to, use, the, civil, law, system, but, it, has, a, unique, system, that, combines, elements, of, an, uncodified, civil, law, dating, back, to, the, corpus, juris, civilis, with, an, element, of, its, own, common, law, long, predating, the, treaty, of, union, with, england, in, 1707, see, legal, institutions, of, scotland, in, the, high, middle, ages, founded, on, the, customary, laws, of, the, tribes, residing, there, historically, scottish, common, law, differed, in, that, the, use, of, precedent, was, subject, to, the, courts, seeking, to, discover, the, principle, that, justifies, a, law, rather, than, searching, for, an, example, as, a, precedent, and, principles, of, natural, justice, and, fairness, have, always, played, a, role, in, scots, law, from, the, 19th, century, the, scottish, approach, to, precedent, developed, into, a, stare, decisis, akin, to, that, already, established, in, england, thereby, reflecting, a, narrower, more, modern, approach, to, the, application, of, case, law, in, subsequent, instances, this, is, not, to, say, that, the, substantive, rules, of, the, common, laws, of, both, countries, are, the, same, but, in, many, matters, particularly, those, of, uk, wide, interest, they, are, similar, scotland, shares, the, supreme, court, with, england, wales, and, northern, ireland, for, civil, cases, the, court, s, decisions, are, binding, on, the, jurisdiction, from, which, a, case, arises, but, only, influential, on, similar, cases, arising, in, scotland, this, has, had, the, effect, of, converging, the, law, in, certain, areas, for, instance, the, modern, uk, law, of, negligence, is, based, on, donoghue, v, stevenson, a, case, originating, in, paisley, scotland, scotland, maintains, a, separate, criminal, law, system, from, the, rest, of, the, uk, with, the, high, court, of, justiciary, being, the, final, court, for, criminal, appeals, the, highest, court, of, appeal, in, civil, cases, brought, in, scotland, is, now, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, kingdom, before, october, 2009, final, appellate, jurisdiction, lay, with, the, house, of, lords, the, original, colony, of, new, netherland, was, settled, by, the, dutch, and, the, law, was, also, dutch, when, the, english, captured, pre, existing, colonies, they, continued, to, allow, the, local, settlers, to, keep, their, civil, law, however, the, dutch, settlers, revolted, against, the, english, and, the, colony, was, recaptured, by, the, dutch, in, 1664, the, colony, of, new, york, had, two, distinct, legal, systems, on, manhattan, island, and, along, the, hudson, river, sophisticated, courts, modeled, on, those, of, the, netherlands, were, resolving, disputes, learnedly, in, accordance, with, dutch, customary, law, on, long, island, staten, island, and, in, westchester, on, the, other, hand, english, courts, were, administering, a, crude, untechnical, variant, of, the, common, law, carried, from, puritan, new, england, and, practiced, without, the, intercession, of, lawyers, when, the, english, finally, regained, control, of, new, netherland, they, imposed, common, law, upon, all, the, colonists, including, the, dutch, this, was, problematic, as, the, patroon, system, of, land, holding, based, on, the, feudal, system, and, civil, law, continued, to, operate, in, the, colony, until, it, was, abolished, in, the, mid, 19th, century, new, york, began, a, codification, of, its, law, in, the, 19th, century, the, only, part, of, this, codification, process, that, was, considered, complete, is, known, as, the, field, code, applying, to, civil, procedure, the, influence, of, roman, dutch, law, continued, in, the, colony, well, into, the, late, 19th, century, the, codification, of, a, law, of, general, obligations, shows, how, remnants, of, the, civil, law, tradition, in, new, york, continued, on, from, the, dutch, days, under, louisiana, s, codified, system, the, louisiana, civil, code, private, law, that, is, substantive, law, between, private, sector, parties, is, based, on, principles, of, law, from, continental, europe, with, some, common, law, influences, these, principles, derive, ultimately, from, roman, law, transmitted, through, french, law, and, spanish, law, as, the, state, s, current, territory, intersects, the, area, of, north, america, colonized, by, spain, and, by, france, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, louisiana, code, does, not, directly, derive, from, the, napoleonic, code, as, the, latter, was, enacted, in, 1804, one, year, after, the, louisiana, purchase, however, the, two, codes, are, similar, in, many, respects, due, to, common, roots, louisiana, s, criminal, law, largely, rests, on, english, common, law, louisiana, s, administrative, law, is, generally, similar, to, the, administrative, law, of, the, u, s, federal, government, and, other, u, s, states, louisiana, s, procedural, law, is, generally, in, line, with, that, of, other, u, s, states, which, in, turn, is, generally, based, on, the, u, s, federal, rules, of, civil, procedure, historically, notable, among, the, louisiana, code, s, differences, from, common, law, is, the, role, of, property, rights, among, women, particularly, in, inheritance, gained, by, widows, the, u, s, state, of, california, has, a, system, based, on, common, law, but, it, has, codified, the, law, in, the, manner, of, civil, law, jurisdictions, the, reason, for, the, enactment, of, the, california, codes, in, the, 19th, century, was, to, replace, a, pre, existing, system, based, on, spanish, civil, law, with, a, system, based, on, common, law, similar, to, that, in, most, other, states, california, and, a, number, of, other, western, states, however, have, retained, the, concept, of, community, property, derived, from, civil, law, the, california, courts, have, treated, portions, of, the, codes, as, an, extension, of, the, common, law, tradition, subject, to, judicial, development, in, the, same, manner, as, judge, made, common, law, most, notably, in, the, case, li, v, yellow, cab, co, 13, cal, 3d, 804, 1975, the, california, supreme, court, adopted, the, principle, of, comparative, negligence, in, the, face, of, a, california, civil, code, provision, codifying, the, traditional, common, law, doctrine, of, contributory, negligence, after, erie, v, tompkins, 304, u, s, 64, 78, 1938, overruled, joseph, storey, s, decision, in, swift, v, tyson, the, federal, common, law, was, limited, to, some, jurisdictions, stated, in, the, constitution, such, as, admiralty, and, possibly, some, areas, that, may, not, be, the, traditional, jurisdiction, of, state, law, later, courts, have, limited, erie, slightly, to, create, a, few, situations, where, united, states, federal, courts, are, permitted, to, create, federal, common, law, rules, without, express, statutory, authority, for, example, where, a, federal, rule, of, decision, is, necessary, to, protect, uniquely, federal, interests, such, as, foreign, affairs, or, financial, instruments, issued, by, the, federal, government, except, on, constitutional, issues, and, some, procedural, issues, congress, is, free, to, legislatively, overrule, federal, courts, common, law, in, swift, the, united, states, supreme, court, had, held, that, federal, courts, hearing, cases, brought, under, their, diversity, jurisdiction, allowing, them, to, hear, cases, between, parties, from, different, states, had, to, apply, the, statutory, law, of, the, states, but, not, the, common, law, developed, by, state, courts, instead, the, supreme, court, permitted, the, federal, courts, to, make, their, own, common, law, based, on, general, principles, of, law, erie, overruled, swift, v, tyson, and, instead, held, that, federal, courts, exercising, diversity, jurisdiction, had, to, use, all, of, the, same, substantive, law, as, the, courts, of, the, states, in, which, they, were, located, as, the, erie, court, put, it, there, is, no, general, federal, common, law, post, 1938, federal, courts, deciding, issues, that, arise, under, state, law, are, required, to, defer, to, state, court, interpretations, of, state, statutes, or, reason, what, a, state, s, highest, court, would, rule, if, presented, with, the, issue, or, to, certify, the, question, to, the, state, s, highest, court, for, resolution, outside, diversity, jurisdiction, and, when, there, is, no, federal, statute, post, erie, federal, courts, have, continued, to, create, causes, of, action, justice, lewis, powell, strongly, objected, to, this, practice, in, an, influential, dissent, for, the, case, cannon, v, university, of, chicago, most, executive, branch, agencies, in, the, united, states, federal, government, have, some, adjudicatory, authority, to, greater, or, lesser, extent, agencies, honor, their, own, precedent, to, ensure, consistent, results, agency, decision, making, is, governed, by, the, administrative, procedure, act, of, 1946, for, example, the, national, labor, relations, board,

of, british, administration, of, the, eastern, half, of, the, mosquito, coast, from, the, mid, 17th, century, until, about, 1894, the, william, walker, period, from, about, 1855, through, 1857, us,

importation, between, 1979, and, the, present, of, us, culture, and, institutions, israel, has, no, formal, written, constitution, its, basic, principles, are, inherited, from, the, law, of, the, british, mandate, of, palestine, and, thus, resemble, those, of, british, and, american, law, namely, the, role, of, courts, in, creating, the, body, of, law, and, the, authority, of, the, supreme, court, in, reviewing, and, if, necessary, overturning, legislative, and, executive, decisions, as, well, as, employing, the, adversarial, system, however, because, israel, has, no, written, constitution, basic, laws, can, be, changed, by, a, vote, of, 61, out, of, 120, votes, in, the, parliament, one, of, the, primary, reasons, that, the, israeli, constitution, remains, unwritten, is, the, fear, by, whatever, party, holds, power, that, creating, a, written, constitution, combined, with, the, common, law, elements, would, severely, limit, the, powers, of, the, knesset, which, following, the, doctrine, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, holds, near, unlimited, power, roman, dutch, common, law, is, a, bijuridical, or, mixed, system, of, law, similar, to, the, common, law, system, in, scotland, and, louisiana, roman, dutch, common, law, jurisdictions, include, south, africa, botswana, lesotho, namibia, swaziland, sri, lanka, and, zimbabwe, many, of, these, jurisdictions, recognise, customary, law, and, in, some, such, as, south, africa, the, constitution, requires, that, the, common, law, be, developed, in, accordance, with, the, bill, of, rights, roman, dutch, common, law, is, a, development, of, roman, dutch, law, by, courts, in, the, roman, dutch, common, law, jurisdictions, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands,
