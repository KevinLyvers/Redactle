from, 1700, to, the, present, kannada, has, it, been, influenced, to, a, considerable, degree, by, sanskrit, and, prakrit, both, in, morphology, phonetics, vocabulary, grammar, and, syntax, the, three, principle, sources, of, influence, on, literary, kannada, grammar, appear, to, be, p, ini, s, grammar, non, p, inian, schools, of, sanskrit, grammar, particularly, katantra, and, sakatayana, schools, and, prakrit, grammar, literary, prakrit, seems, to, have, prevailed, in, karnataka, since, ancient, times, speakers, of, vernacular, prakrit, may, have, come, into, contact, with, kannada, speakers, thus, influencing, their, language, even, before, kannada, was, used, for, administrative, or, liturgical, purposes, the, scholar, k, v, narayana, claims, that, many, tribal, languages, which, are, now, designated, as, kannada, dialects, could, be, nearer, to, the, earlier, form, of, the, language, with, lesser, influence, from, other, languages, the, work, of, scholar, iravatham, mahadevan, indicates, that, kannada, was, already, a, language, of, rich, spoken, tradition, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, that, and, based, on, the, native, kannada, words, found, in, prakrit, inscriptions, of, that, period, kannada, must, have, been, spoken, by, a, broad, and, stable, population, kannada, includes, many, loan, words, from, sanskrit, some, unaltered, loan, words, sanskrit,

from, va, a, hu, ime, full, moon, from, pu, iv, the, earliest, kannada, inscriptions, are, from, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, ad, but, there, are, a, number, of, earlier, texts, that, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, ancestor, language, of, old, kannada, iravatam, mahadevan, a, brahmin, author, of, a, work, on, early, tamil, epigraphy, argued, that, oral, traditions, in, kannada, and, telugu, existed, much, before, written, documents, were, produced, although, the, rock, inscriptions, of, ashoka, were, written, in, prakrit, the, spoken, language, in, those, regions, was, kannada, as, the, case, may, be, he, can, be, quoted, as, follows, if, proof, were, needed, to, show, that, kannada, was, the, spoken, language, of, the, region, during, the, early, period, one, needs, only, to, study, the, large, number, of, kannada, personal, names, and, place, names, in, the, early, prakrit, inscriptions, on, stone, and, copper, in, upper, south, india, kannada, was, spoken, by, relatively, large, and, well, settled, populations, living, in, well, organised, states, ruled, by, able, dynasties, like, the, satavahanas, with, a, high, degree, of, civilisation, there, is, therefore, no, reason, to, believe, that, these, languages, had, less, rich, or, less, expressive, oral, traditions, than, tamil, had, towards, the, end, of, its, pre, literate, period, the, ashoka, rock, edict, found, at, brahmagiri, dated, to, 250, bc, has, been, suggested, to, contain, words, isila, meaning, to, throw, viz, an, arrow, etc, in, identifiable, kannada, in, some, 3rd, 1st,

studied, in, detail, by, iravatham, mahadevan, also, mahadevan, argues, that, the, words, erumi, kavudi, poshil, and, tayiyar, have, their, origin, in, kannada, because, tamil, cognates, are, not, available, settar, adds, the, words, nadu, and, ilayar, to, this, list, mahadevan, feels, that, some, grammatical, categories, found, in, these, inscriptions, are, also, unique, to, kannada, rather,
