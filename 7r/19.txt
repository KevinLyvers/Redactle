of, e, commerce, along, with, some, developments, which, raised, concerns, such, as, increased, use, of, selective, distribution, systems, which, allow, manufacturers, to, control, routes, to, market, and, increased, use, of, contractual, restrictions, to, better, control, product, distribution, the, european, commission, felt, that, some, emerging, practices, might, be, justified, if, they, could,

generated, via, the, online, channel, the, rate, of, growth, of, the, number, of, internet, users, in, the, arab, countries, has, been, rapid, 13, 1, in, 2015, a, significant, portion, of, the, e, commerce, market, in, the, middle, east, comprises, people, in, the, 30, 34, year, age, group, egypt, has, the, largest, number, of, internet, users, in, the, region, followed, by, saudi, arabia, and, morocco, these, constitute, 3, 4th, of, the, region, s, share, yet, internet, penetration, is, low, 35, in, egypt, and, 65, in, saudi, arabia, the, gulf, cooperation, council, countries, have, a, rapidly, growing, market, and, are, characterized, by, a, population, that, becomes, wealthier, yuldashev, as, such, retailers, have, launched, arabic, language, websites, as, a, means, to, target, this, population, secondly, there, are, predictions, of, increased, mobile, purchases, and, an, expanding, internet, audience, yuldashev, the, growth, and, development, of, the, two, aspects, make, the, gcc, countries, become, larger, players, in, the, electronic, commerce, market, with, time, progress, specifically, research, shows, that, the, e, commerce, market, is, expected, to, grow, to, over, 20, billion, by, 2020, among, these, gcc, countries, yuldashev, the, e, commerce, market, has, also, gained, much, popularity, among, western, countries, and, in, particular, europe, and, the, u, s, these, countries, have, been, highly, characterized, by, consumer, packaged, goods, cpg, geisler, 34, however, trends, show, that, there, are, future, signs, of, a, reverse, similar, to, the, gcc, countries, there, has, been, increased, purchase, of, goods, and, services, in, online, channels, rather, than, offline, channels, activist, investors, are, trying, hard, to, consolidate, and, slash, their, overall, cost, and, the, governments, in, western, countries, continue, to, impose, more, regulation, on, cpg, manufacturers, geisler, 36, in, these, senses, cpg, investors, are, being, forced, to, adapt, to, e, commerce, as, it, is, effective, as, well, as, a, means, for, them, to, thrive, the, future, trends, in, the, gcc, countries, will, be, similar, to, that, of, the, western, countries, despite, the, forces, that, push, business, to, adapt, e, commerce, as, a, means, to, sell, goods, and, products, the, manner, in, which, customers, make, purchases, is, similar, in, countries, from, these, two, regions, for, instance, there, has, been, an, increased, usage, of, smartphones, which, comes, in, conjunction, with, an, increase, in, the, overall, internet, audience, from, the, regions, yuldashev, writes, that, consumers, are, scaling, up, to, more, modern, technology, that, allows, for, mobile, marketing, however, the, percentage, of, smartphone, and, internet, users, who, make, online, purchases, is, expected, to, vary, in, the, first, few, years, it, will, be, independent, on, the, willingness, of, the, people, to, adopt, this, new, trend, the, statistics, portal, for, example, uae, has, the, greatest, smartphone, penetration, of, 73, 8, per, cent, and, has, 91, 9, per, cent, of, its, population, has, access, to, the, internet, on, the, other, hand, smartphone, penetration, in, europe, has, been, reported, to, be, at, 64, 7, per, cent, the, statistics, portal, regardless, the, disparity, in, percentage, between, these, regions, is, expected, to, level, out, in, future, because, e, commerce, technology, is, expected, to, grow, to, allow, for, more, users, the, e, commerce, business, within, these, two, regions, will, result, in, competition, government, bodies, at, the, country, level, will, enhance, their, measures, and, strategies, to, ensure, sustainability, and, consumer, protection, krings, et, al, these, increased, measures, will, raise, the, environmental, and, social, standards, in, the, countries, factors, that, will, determine, the, success, of, the, e, commerce, market, in, these, countries, for, example, an, adoption, of, tough, sanctions, will, make, it, difficult, for, companies, to, enter, the, e, commerce, market, while, lenient, sanctions, will, allow, ease, of, companies, as, such, the, future, trends, between, gcc, countries, and, the, western, countries, will, be, independent, of, these, sanctions, krings, et, al, these, countries, need, to, make, rational, conclusions, in, coming, up, with, effective, sanctions, india, has, an, internet, user, base, of, about, 460, million, as, of, december, 2017, despite, being, the, third, largest, user, base, in, the, world, the, penetration, of, the, internet, is, low, compared, to, markets, like, the, united, states, united, kingdom, or, france, but, is, growing, at, a, much, faster, rate, adding, around, six, million, new, entrants, every, month, in, india, cash, on, delivery, is, the, most, preferred, payment, method, accumulating, 75, of, the, e, retail, activities, the, india, retail, market, is, expected, to, rise, from, 2, 5, in, 2016, to, 5, in, 2020, in, 2013, brazil, s, e, commerce, was, growing, quickly, with, retail, e, commerce, sales, expected, to, grow, at, a, double, digit, pace, through, 2014, by, 2016, emarketer, expected, retail, e, commerce, sales, in, brazil, to, reach, 17, 3, billion, logistics, in, e, commerce, mainly, concerns, fulfillment, online, markets, and, retailers, have, to, find, the, best, possible, way, to, fill, orders, and, deliver, products, small, companies, usually, control, their, own, logistic, operation, because, they, do, not, have, the, ability, to, hire, an, outside, company, most, large, companies, hire, a, fulfillment, service, that, takes, care, of, a, company, s, logistic, needs, the, optimization, of, logistics, processes, that, contains, long, term, investment, in, an, efficient, storage, infrastructure, system, and, adoption, of, inventory, management, strategies, is, crucial, to, prioritize, customer, satisfaction, throughout, the, entire, process, from, order, placement, to, final, delivery, e, commerce, markets, are, growing, at, noticeable, rates, the, online, market, is, expected, to, grow, by, 56, in, 2015, 2020, in, 2017, retail, e, commerce, sales, worldwide, amounted, to, 2, 3, trillion, us, dollars, and, e, retail, revenues, are, projected, to, grow, to, 4, 891, trillion, us, dollars, in, 2021, traditional, markets, are, only, expected, 2, growth, during, the, same, time, brick, and, mortar, retailers, are, struggling, because, of, online, retailer, s, ability, to, offer, lower, prices, and, higher, efficiency, many, larger, retailers, are, able, to, maintain, a, presence, offline, and, online, by, linking, physical, and, online, offerings, e, commerce, allows, customers, to, overcome, geographical, barriers, and, allows, them, to, purchase, products, anytime, and, from, anywhere, online, and, traditional, markets, have, different, strategies, for, conducting, business, traditional, retailers, offer, fewer, assortment, of, products, because, of, shelf, space, where, online, retailers, often, hold, no, inventory, but, send, customer, orders, directly, to, the, manufacturer, the, pricing, strategies, are, also, different, for, traditional, and, online, retailers, traditional, retailers, base, their, prices, on, store, traffic, and, the, cost, to, keep, inventory, online, retailers, base, prices, on, the, speed, of, delivery, there, are, two, ways, for, marketers, to, conduct, business, through, e, commerce, fully, online, or, online, along, with, a, brick, and, mortar, store, online, marketers, can, offer, lower, prices, greater, product, selection, and, high, efficiency, rates, many, customers, prefer, online, markets, if, the, products, can, be, delivered, quickly, at, relatively, low, price, however, online, retailers, cannot, offer, the, physical, experience, that, traditional, retailers, can, it, can, be, difficult, to, judge, the, quality, of, a, product, without, the, physical, experience, which, may, cause, customers, to, experience, product, or, seller, uncertainty, another, issue, regarding, the, online, market, is, concerns, about, the, security, of, online, transactions, many, customers, remain, loyal, to, well, known, retailers, because, of, this, issue, security, is, a, primary, problem, for, e, commerce, in, developed, and, developing, countries, e, commerce, security, is, protecting, businesses, websites, and, customers, from, unauthorized, access, use, alteration, or, destruction, the, type, of, threats, include, malicious, codes, unwanted, programs, ad, ware, spyware, phishing, hacking, and, cyber, vandalism, e, commerce, websites, use, different, tools, to, avert, security, threats, these, tools, include, firewalls, encryption, software, digital, certificates, and, passwords, for, a, long, time, companies, had, been, troubled, by, the, gap, between, the, benefits, which, supply, chain, technology, has, and, the, solutions, to, deliver, those, benefits, however, the, emergence, of, e, commerce, has, provided, a, more, practical, and, effective, way, of, delivering, the, benefits, of, the, new, supply, chain, technologies, e, commerce, has, the, capability, to, integrate, all, inter, company, and, intra, company, functions, meaning, that, the, three, flows, physical, flow, financial, flow, and, information, flow, of, the, supply, chain, could, be, also, affected, by, e, commerce, the, affections, on, physical, flows, improved, the, way, of, product, and, inventory, movement, level, for, companies, for, the, information, flows, e, commerce, optimized, the, capacity, of, information, processing, than, companies, used, to, have, and, for, the, financial, flows, e, commerce, allows, companies, to, have, more, efficient, payment, and, settlement, solutions, in, addition, e, commerce, has, a, more, sophisticated, level, of, impact, on, supply, chains, firstly, the, performance, gap, will, be, eliminated, since, companies, can, identify, gaps, between, different, levels, of, supply, chains, by, electronic, means, of, solutions, secondly, as, a, result, of, e, commerce, emergence, new, capabilities, such, implementing, erp, systems, like, sap, erp, xero, or, megaventory, have, helped, companies, to, manage, operations, with, customers, and, suppliers, yet, these, new, capabilities, are, still, not, fully, exploited, thirdly, technology, companies, would, keep, investing, on, new, e, commerce, software, solutions, as, they, are, expecting, investment, return, fourthly, e, commerce, would, help, to, solve, many, aspects, of, issues, that, companies, may, feel, difficult, to, cope, with, such, as, political, barriers, or, cross, country, changes, finally, e, commerce, provides, companies, a, more, efficient, and, effective, way, to, collaborate, with, each, other, within, the, supply, chain, e, commerce, helps, create, new, job, opportunities, due, to, information, related, services, software, app, and, digital, products, it, also, causes, job, losses, the, areas, with, the, greatest, predicted, job, loss, are, retail, postal, and, travel, agencies, the, development, of, e, commerce, will, create, jobs, that, require, highly, skilled, workers, to, manage, large, amounts, of, information, customer, demands, and, production, processes, in, contrast, people, with, poor, technical, skills, cannot, enjoy, the, wages, welfare, on, the, other, hand, because, e, commerce, requires, sufficient, stocks, that, could, be, delivered, to, customers, in, time, the, warehouse, becomes, an, important, element, warehouse, needs, more, staff, to, manage, supervise, and, organize, thus, the, condition, of, warehouse, environment, will, be, concerned, by, employees, e, commerce, brings, convenience,
