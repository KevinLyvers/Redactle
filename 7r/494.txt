at, common, law, damages, are, a, remedy, in, the, form, of, a, monetary, award, to, be, paid, to, a, claimant, as, compensation, for, loss, or, injury, to, warrant, the, award, the, claimant, must, show, that, a, breach, of, duty, has, caused, foreseeable, loss, to, be, recognized, at, law, the, loss, must, involve, damage, to, property, or, mental, or, physical, injury, pure, economic, loss, is, rarely, recognized, for, the, award, of, damages, compensatory, damages, are, further, categorized, into, special, damages, which, are, economic, losses, such, as, loss, of, earnings, property, damage, and, medical, expenses, and, general, damages, which, are, non, economic, damages, such, as, pain, and, suffering, and, emotional, distress, rather, than, being, compensatory, at, common, law, damages, may, instead, be, nominal, contemptuous, or, exemplary, among, the, saxons, a, monetary, value, called, a, weregild, was, assigned, to, every, human, being, and, every, piece, of, property, in, the, salic, code, if, property, was, stolen, or, someone, was, injured, or, killed, the, guilty, person, had, to, pay, the, weregild, as, restitution, to, the, victim, s, family, or, to, the, owner, of, the, property, recovery, of, damages, by, a, plaintiff, in, lawsuit, is, subject, to, the, legal, principle, that, damages, must, be, proximately, caused, by, the, wrongful, conduct, of, the, defendant, this, is, known, as, the, principle, of, proximate, cause, this, principle, governs, the, recovery, of, all, compensatory, damages, whether, the, underlying, claim, is, based, on, contract, tort, or, both, damages, are, likely, to, be, limited, to, those, reasonably, foreseeable, by, the, defendant, if, a, defendant, could, not, reasonably, have, foreseen, that, someone, might, be, hurt, by, their, actions, there, may, be, no, liability, this, rule, does, not, usually, apply, to, intentional, torts, for, example, tort, of, deceit, and, also, has, stunted, applicability, to, the, quantum, in, negligence, where, the, maxim, intended, consequences, are, never, too, remote, applies, never, is, inaccurate, here, but, resorts, to, unforeseeable, direct, and, natural, consequences, of, an, act, it, may, be, useful, for, the, lawyers, the, plaintiff, and, or, the, defendant, to, employ, forensic, accountants, or, someone, trained, in, the, relevant, field, of, economics, to, give, evidence, on, the, value, of, the, loss, in, this, case, they, may, be, called, upon, to, give, opinion, evidence, as, an, expert, witness, compensatory, damages, are, paid, to, compensate, the, claimant, for, loss, injury, or, harm, suffered, by, the, claimant, as, a, result, of, another, s, breach, of, duty, that, caused, the, loss, for, example, compensatory, damages, may, be, awarded, as, the, result, of, a, negligence, claim, under, tort, law, expectation, damages, are, used, in, contract, law, to, put, an, injured, party, in, the, position, it, would, have, occupied, but, for, the, breach, compensatory, damages, can, be, classified, as, special, damages, and, general, damages, liability, for, payment, of, an, award, of, damages, is, established, when, the, claimant, proves, on, the, balance, of, probabilities, that, a, defendant, s, wrongful, act, caused, a, tangible, harm, loss, or, injury, to, the, plaintiff, once, that, threshold, is, met, the, plaintiff, is, entitled, to, some, amount, of, recovery, for, that, loss, or, injury, no, recovery, is, not, an, option, the, court, must, then, assess, the, amount, of, compensation, attributable, to, the, harmful, acts, of, the, defendant, the, amount, of, damages, a, plaintiff, would, recover, is, usually, measured, on, a, loss, of, bargain, basis, also, known, as, expectation, loss, or, economic, loss, this, concept, reflects, the, difference, between, the, value, of, what, has, been, received, and, its, value, as, represented, damages, are, usually, assessed, at, the, date, of, the, wrongful, act, but, in, england, and, wales, pelling, j, has, observed, that, this, is, not, the, case, if, justice, requires, the, assessment, of, damages, to, be, calculated, at, some, other, date, in, murfin, v, ford, campbell, an, agreement, had, been, entered, into, whereby, company, shares, were, exchanged, for, loan, notes, which, could, only, be, redeemed, if, certain, profit, thresholds, had, been, achieved, in, the, relevant, accounting, years, as, the, thresholds, were, not, met, the, loan, notes, were, not, redeemable, but, at, the, date, of, the, advisors, breach, of, contract, this, could, not, be, known, only, the, loan, notes, face, value, could, be, known, the, conclusion, was, that, in, this, case, valuation, could, not, be, done, until, after, the, profit, performance, became, known, in, his, judgement, pelling, also, referred, to, the, case, of, smith, new, court, securities, ltd, v, scrimgeour, vickers, asset, management, ltd, a, case, where, continuing, misrepresentation, affected, the, appropriate, date, for, damages, to, be, assessed, special, damages, compensate, the, claimant, for, the, quantifiable, monetary, losses, he, has, suffered, for, example, extra, costs, repair, or, replacement, of, damaged, property, lost, earnings, both, historically, and, in, the, future, loss, of, irreplaceable, items, additional, domestic, costs, and, so, on, they, are, seen, in, both, personal, and, commercial, actions, special, damages, can, include, direct, losses, such, as, amounts, the, claimant, had, to, spend, to, try, to, mitigate, damages, and, consequential, or, economic, losses, resulting, from, lost, profits, in, a, business, damages, in, tort, are, awarded, generally, to, place, the, claimant, in, the, position, in, which, he, would, have, been, had, the, tort, not, taken, place, damages, for, breach, of, contract, are, generally, awarded, to, place, the, claimant, in, the, position, in, which, he, would, have, been, had, the, contract, not, been, breached, this, can, often, result, in, a, different, measure, of, damages, in, cases, where, it, is, possible, to, frame, a, claim, in, either, contract, or, tort, it, is, necessary, to, be, aware, of, what, gives, the, best, outcome, if, the, transaction, was, a, good, bargain, contract, generally, gives, a, better, result, for, the, claimant, as, an, example, neal, agrees, to, sell, mary, an, antique, rolex, watch, for, 100, in, fact, the, watch, is, a, fake, and, worth, only, 50, if, it, had, been, a, genuine, antique, rolex, it, would, have, been, worth, 500, neal, is, in, breach, of, contract, and, could, be, sued, in, contract, mary, is, entitled, to, an, item, worth, 500, but, she, has, only, one, worth, 50, her, damages, are, 450, neal, also, induced, mary, to, enter, into, the, contract, through, a, misrepresentation, a, tort, if, mary, sues, in, tort, she, is, entitled, to, damages, that, put, her, back, to, the, same, financial, position, place, she, would, have, been, in, had, the, misrepresentation, not, been, made, she, would, clearly, not, have, entered, into, the, contract, knowing, the, watch, was, fake, and, is, entitled, to, her, 100, back, thus, her, damages, in, tort, are, 100, however, she, would, have, to, return, the, watch, or, else, her, damages, would, be, 50, if, the, transaction, were, a, bad, bargain, tort, gives, a, better, result, for, the, claimant, if, in, the, above, example, mary, had, overpaid, paying, 750, for, the, watch, her, damages, in, the, contract, would, still, be, 450, giving, her, the, item, she, contracted, to, buy, however, in, tort, damages, are, 700, this, is, because, damages, in, tort, put, her, in, the, position, she, would, have, been, in, had, the, tort, not, taken, place, and, are, calculated, as, her, money, back, 750, less, the, value, of, what, she, actually, got, 50, special, damages, are, sometimes, divided, into, incidental, damages, and, consequential, damages, incidental, losses, include, the, costs, needed, to, remedy, problems, and, put, things, right, the, largest, element, is, likely, to, be, the, reinstatement, of, property, damage, take, for, example, a, factory, which, was, burnt, down, by, the, negligence, of, a, contractor, the, claimant, would, be, entitled, to, the, direct, costs, required, to, rebuild, the, factory, and, replace, the, damaged, machinery, the, claimant, may, also, be, entitled, to, any, consequential, losses, these, may, include, the, lost, profits, that, the, claimant, could, have, been, expected, to, make, in, the, period, whilst, the, factory, was, closed, and, rebuilt, on, a, breach, of, contract, by, a, defendant, a, court, generally, awards, the, sum, that, would, restore, the, injured, party, to, the, economic, position, they, expected, from, performance, of, the, promise, or, promises, known, as, an, expectation, measure, or, benefit, of, the, bargain, measure, of, damages, this, rule, however, has, attracted, increasing, scrutiny, from, australian, courts, and, legal, commentators, a, judge, arrives, compensatory, number, by, considering, both, the, type, of, contract, and, the, loss, incurred, when, it, is, either, not, possible, or, not, desirable, to, award, the, victim, in, that, way, a, court, may, award, money, damages, designed, to, restore, the, injured, party, to, the, economic, position, they, occupied, at, the, time, the, contract, was, entered, known, as, the, reliance, measure, or, designed, to, prevent, the, breaching, party, from, being, unjustly, enriched, restitution, see, below, parties, may, contract, for, liquidated, damages, to, be, paid, upon, a, breach, of, the, contract, by, one, of, the, parties, under, common, law, a, liquidated, damages, clause, will, not, be, enforced, if, the, purpose, of, the, term, is, solely, to, punish, a, breach, in, this, case, it, is, termed, penal, damages, the, clause, will, be, enforceable, if, it, involves, a, genuine, attempt, to, quantify, a, loss, in, advance, and, is, a, good, faith, estimate, of, economic, loss, courts, have, ruled, as, excessive, and, invalidated, damages, which, the, parties, contracted, as, liquidated, but, which, the, court, nonetheless, found, to, be, penal, to, determine, whether, a, clause, is, a, liquidated, damages, clause, or, a, penalty, clause, it, is, necessary, to, consider, damages, in, tort, are, generally, awarded, to, place, the, claimant, in, the, position, that, would, have, been, taken, had, the, tort, not, taken, place, damages, in, tort, are, quantified, under, two, headings, general, damages, and, special, damages, in, personal, injury, claims, damages, for, compensation, are, quantified, by, reference, to, the, severity, of, the, injuries, sustained, see, below, general, damages, for, more, details, in, non, personal, injury, claims, for, instance, a, claim, for, professional, negligence, against, solicitors, the, measure, of, damages, will, be, assessed, by, the, loss, suffered, by, the, client, due, to, the, negligent, act, or, omission, by, the, solicitor, giving, rise, to, the, loss, the, loss, must, be, reasonably, foreseeable, and, not, too, remote, financial, losses, are, usually, simple, to, quantify, but, in, complex, cases, which, involve, loss, of, pension, entitlements, and, future, loss, projections, the, instructing, solicitor, will, usually, employ, a, specialist, expert, actuary, or, accountant, to, assist, with, the, quantification, of, the, loss, general, damages, are, monetary, compensation, for, the, non, monetary, aspects, of, the, specific, harm, suffered, these, damages, are, sometimes, termed, pain, suffering, and, loss, of, amenity, examples, of, this, include, physical, or, emotional, pain, and, suffering, loss, of, companionship, loss, of, consortium, disfigurement, loss, of, reputation, impairment, of, mental, or, physical, capacity, hedonic, damages, or, loss, of, enjoyment, of, life, etc, this, is, not, easily, quantifiable, and, depends, on, the, individual, circumstances, of, the, claimant, judges, in, the, united, kingdom, base, the, award, on, damages, awarded, in, similar, previous, cases, in, 2012, the, court, of, appeal, of, england, and, wales, noted, that, this, court, has, not, merely, the, power, but, a, positive, duty, to, monitor, and, where, appropriate, to, alter, the, guideline, rates, for, general, damages, in, personal, injury, actions, general, damages, in, england, and, wales, were, increased, by, 10, for, all, cases, where, judgements, were, given, after, 1, april, 2013, following, changes, to, the, options, available, to, personal, injury, claimants, wanting, to, cover, the, cost, of, their, litigation, general, damages, are, generally, awarded, only, in, claims, brought, by, individuals, when, they, have, suffered, personal, harm, examples, would, be, personal, injury, following, the, tort, of, negligence, by, the, defendant, or, the, tort, of, defamation, the, quantification, of, personal, injury, is, not, an, exact, science, in, english, law, solicitors, treat, personal, injury, claims, as, general, damages, for, pain, and, suffering, and, loss, of, amenity, psla, solicitors, quantify, personal, injury, claims, by, reference, to, previous, awards, made, by, the, courts, which, are, similar, to, the, case, in, hand, the, judicial, college, s, guidelines, for, the, assessment, of, general, damages, in, personal, injury, cases, are, adjusted, following, periodic, review, of, the, awards, which, have, been, made, by, the, courts, since, the, previous, review, the, guidance, which, solicitors, will, take, into, account, to, help, quantify, general, damages, are, when, a, personal, injury, claim, is, settled, either, in, court, or, out, of, court, the, most, common, way, the, compensation, payment, is, made, is, by, a, lump, sum, award, in, full, and, final, settlement, of, the, claim, once, accepted, there, can, be, no, further, award, for, compensation, at, a, later, time, unless, the, claim, is, settled, by, provisional, damages, often, found, in, industrial, injury, claims, such, as, asbestos, related, injuries, statutory, damages, are, an, amount, stipulated, within, the, statute, rather, than, calculated, based, on, the, degree, of, harm, to, the, plaintiff, lawmakers, will, provide, for, statutory, damages, for, acts, in, which, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, value, of, the, harm, to, the, victim, mere, violation, of, the, law, can, entitle, the, victim, to, a, statutory, award, even, if, no, actual, injury, occurred, these, are, different, from, nominal, damages, in, which, no, written, sum, is, specified, nominal, damages, are, very, small, damages, awarded, to, show, that, the, loss, or, harm, suffered, was, technical, rather, than, actual, perhaps, the, most, famous, nominal, damages, award, in, modern, times, has, been, the, 1, verdict, against, the, national, football, league, nfl, in, the, 1986, antitrust, suit, prosecuted, by, the, united, states, football, league, although, the, verdict, was, automatically, trebled, pursuant, to, antitrust, law, in, the, united, states, the, resulting, 3, judgment, was, regarded, as, a, victory, for, the, nfl, historically, one, of, the, best, known, nominal, damage, awards, was, the, farthing, that, the, jury, awarded, to, james, whistler, in, his, libel, suit, against, john, ruskin, in, the, english, jurisdiction, nominal, damages, are, generally, fixed, at, 5, many, times, a, party, that, has, been, wronged, but, is, not, able, to, prove, significant, damages, will, sue, for, nominal, damages, this, is, particularly, common, in, cases, involving, alleged, violations, of, constitutional, rights, such, as, freedom, of, speech, until, 2021, in, the, united, states, there, was, a, circuit, split, as, to, whether, nominal, damages, may, be, used, if, a, constitutional, violation, had, occurred, but, has, since, been, rendered, moot, the, supreme, court, decided, 8, 1, in, the, 2021, case, uzuegbunam, v, preczewski, that, nominal, damages, are, appropriate, means, to, redress, violated, rights, otherwise, now, rendered, moot, contemptuous, damages, are, a, form, of, damage, award, available, in, some, jurisdictions, they, are, similar, to, nominal, damages, awards, as, they, are, given, when, the, plaintiff, s, suit, is, trivial, used, only, to, settle, a, point, of, honor, or, law, awards, are, usually, of, the, smallest, amount, usually, 1, cent, or, similar, the, key, distinction, is, that, in, jurisdictions, that, follow, the, loser, pays, for, attorney, fees, the, claimant, in, a, contemptuous, damages, case, may, be, required, to, pay, their, own, attorney, fees, traditionally, the, court, awarded, the, smallest, coin, in, the, realm, which, in, england, was, one, farthing, 1, 960, of, a, pound, before, decimalisation, in, the, 1970s, court, costs, are, not, awarded, generally, punitive, damages, which, are, also, termed, exemplary, damages, in, the, united, kingdom, are, not, awarded, in, order, to, compensate, the, plaintiff, but, in, order, to, reform, or, deter, the, defendant, and, similar, persons, from, pursuing, a, course, of, action, such, as, that, which, damaged, the, plaintiff, punitive, damages, are, awarded, only, in, special, cases, where, conduct, was, egregiously, insidious, and, are, over, and, above, the, amount, of, compensatory, damages, such, as, in, the, event, of, malice, or, intent, great, judicial, restraint, is, expected, to, be, exercised, in, their, application, in, the, united, states, punitive, damages, awards, are, subject, to, the, limitations, imposed, by, the, due, process, of, law, clauses, of, the, fifth, and, fourteenth, amendments, to, the, united, states, constitution, in, england, and, wales, exemplary, damages, are, limited, to, the, circumstances, set, out, by, lord, devlin, in, the, leading, case, of, rookes, v, barnard, they, are, rookes, v, barnard, has, been, much, criticized, and, has, not, been, followed, in, canada, or, australia, or, by, the, privy, council, punitive, damages, awarded, in, a, us, case, would, be, difficult, to, get, recognition, for, in, a, european, court, where, punitive, damages, are, most, likely, to, be, considered, to, violate, ordre, public, some, jurisdictions, recognize, a, form, of, damages, called, aggravated, damages, that, are, similar, to, punitive, or, exemplary, damages, aggravated, damages, are, not, often, awarded, they, apply, where, the, injury, has, been, aggravated, by, the, wrongdoer, s, behaviour, for, example, their, cruelty, in, certain, areas, of, the, law, another, head, of, damages, has, long, been, available, whereby, the, defendant, is, made, to, give, up, the, profits, made, through, the, civil, wrong, in, restitution, doyle, and, wright, define, restitutionary, damages, as, being, a, monetary, remedy, that, is, measured, according, to, the, defendant, s, gain, rather, than, the, plaintiff, s, loss, the, plaintiff, thereby, gains, damages, which, are, not, measured, by, reference, to, any, loss, sustained, in, some, areas, of, the, law, this, heading, of, damages, is, uncontroversial, most, particularly, intellectual, property, rights, and, breach, of, fiduciary, relationship, in, england, and, wales, the, house, of, lords, case, of, attorney, general, v, blake, opened, up, the, possibility, of, restitutionary, damages, for, breach, of, contract, in, this, case, the, profits, made, by, a, defecting, spy, george, blake, for, the, publication, of, his, book, were, awarded, to, the, british, government, for, breach, of, contract, the, case, has, been, followed, in, english, courts, but, the, situations, in, which, restitutionary, damages, will, be, available, remain, unclear, the, basis, for, restitutionary, damages, is, much, debated, but, is, usually, seen, as, based, on, denying, a, wrongdoer, any, profit, from, his, wrongdoing, the, really, difficult, question, and, one, which, is, currently, unanswered, relates, to, what, wrongs, should, allow, this, remedy, in, addition, to, damages, the, successful, party, is, often, entitled, to, be, awarded, their, reasonable, legal, costs, that, they, spent, during, the, case, this, is, the, rule, in, most, countries, other, than, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, a, party, generally, is, not, entitled, to, its, attorneys, fees, or, for, hardships, undergone, during, trial, unless, the, parties, agreed, in, a, contract, that, attorney, s, fees, should, be, covered, or, a, specific, statute, or, law, permits, recovery, of, legal, fees, such, as, discrimination
