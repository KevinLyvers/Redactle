within, the, traditional, left, right, spectrum, fascism, rose, to, prominence, in, early, 20th, century, europe, the, first, fascist, movements, emerged, in, italy, during, world, war, i, before, spreading, to, other, european, countries, most, notably, germany, fascism, also, had, adherents, outside, of, europe, fascists, saw, world, war, i, as, a, revolution, that, brought, massive, changes, to, the, nature, of, war, society, the, state, and, technology, the, advent, of, total, war, and, the, mass, mobilization, of, society, erased, the, distinction, between, civilians, and, combatants, a, military, citizenship, arose, in, which, all, citizens, were, involved, with, the, military, in, some, manner, the, war, resulted, in, the, rise, of, a, powerful, state, capable, of, mobilizing, millions, of, people, to, serve, on, the, front, lines, and, providing, logistics, to, support, them, as, well, as, having, unprecedented, authority, to, intervene, in, the, lives, of, citizens, fascism, rejects, assertions, that, violence, is, inherently, negative, or, pointless, instead, viewing, imperialism, political, violence, and, war, as, means, to, national, rejuvenation, fascists, often, advocate, for, the, establishment, of, a, totalitarian, one, party, state, and, for, a, dirigiste, economy, a, market, economy, in, which, the, state, plays, a, strong, directive, role, through, economic, interventionist, policies, with, the, principal, goal, of, achieving, autarky, national, economic, self, sufficiency, fascism, s, extreme, authoritarianism, and, nationalism, often, manifest, as, a, belief, in, racial, purity, or, a, master, race, usually, blended, with, some, variant, of, racism, or, discrimination, against, a, demonized, other, such, as, jews, homosexuals, transgender, people, ethnic, minorities, or, immigrants, these, ideas, have, motivated, fascist, regimes, to, commit, massacres, forced, sterilizations, deportations, and, genocides, during, world, war, ii, the, actions, of, the, fascist, axis, powers, with, their, genocidal, and, imperialist, ambitions, caused, the, death, of, millions, of, people, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, fascism, as, an, ideology, has, been, largely, disgraced, and, few, parties, have, openly, described, themselves, as, fascist, the, term, is, often, used, pejoratively, by, political, opponents, the, descriptions, of, neo, fascist, or, post, fascist, are, sometimes, employed, to, describe, contemporary, parties, with, ideologies, similar, to, or, rooted, in, 20th, century, fascist, movements, some, opposition, groups, have, adopted, the, label, anti, fascist, often, shortened, to, antifa, to, signify, their, stance, the, italian, term, fascismo, is, derived, from, fascio, meaning, bundle, of, sticks, ultimately, from, the, latin, word, fasces, this, was, the, name, given, to, political, organizations, in, italy, known, as, fasci, groups, similar, to, guilds, or, syndicates, according, to, italian, fascist, dictator, benito, mussolini, s, own, account, the, fasces, of, revolutionary, action, were, founded, in, italy, in, 1915, in, 1919, mussolini, founded, the, italian, fasces, of, combat, in, milan, which, became, the, national, fascist, party, two, years, later, the, fascists, came, to, associate, the, term, with, the, ancient, roman, fasces, or, fascio, littorio, a, bundle, of, rods, tied, around, an, axe, an, ancient, roman, symbol, of, the, authority, of, the, civic, magistrate, carried, by, his, lictors, the, symbolism, of, the, fasces, suggested, strength, through, unity, a, single, rod, is, easily, broken, while, the, bundle, is, difficult, to, break, similar, symbols, were, developed, by, different, fascist, movements, for, example, the, falange, symbol, is, five, arrows, joined, by, a, yoke, historians, political, scientists, and, other, scholars, have, long, debated, the, exact, nature, of, fascism, historian, ian, kershaw, once, wrote, that, trying, to, define, fascism, is, like, trying, to, nail, jelly, to, the, wall, each, different, group, described, as, fascist, has, at, least, some, unique, elements, and, many, definitions, of, fascism, have, been, criticized, as, either, too, broad, or, too, narrow, according, to, many, scholars, fascism, especially, once, in, power, has, historically, attacked, communism, conservatism, and, parliamentary, liberalism, attracting, support, primarily, from, the, far, right, frequently, cited, as, a, standard, definition, by, notable, scholars, such, as, roger, griffin, randall, schweller, bo, rothstein, federico, finchelstein, and, stephen, d, shenfield, is, that, of, historian, stanley, g, payne, his, definition, of, fascism, focuses, on, three, concepts, umberto, eco, lists, fourteen, features, that, are, typical, of, what, i, would, like, to, call, ur, fascism, or, eternal, fascism, these, features, cannot, be, organized, into, a, system, many, of, them, contradict, each, other, and, are, also, typical, of, other, kinds, of, despotism, or, fanaticism, but, it, is, enough, that, one, of, them, be, present, to, allow, fascism, to, coagulate, around, it, historian, john, lukacs, argues, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, generic, fascism, he, claims, that, nazism, and, communism, are, essentially, manifestations, of, populism, and, that, states, such, as, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, are, more, different, from, each, other, than, they, are, similar, in, his, book, how, fascism, works, the, politics, of, us, and, them, 2018, jason, stanley, defined, fascism, as, a, cult, of, the, leader, who, promises, national, restoration, in, the, face, of, humiliation, brought, on, by, supposed, communists, marxists, and, minorities, and, immigrants, who, are, supposedly, posing, a, threat, to, the, character, and, the, history, of, a, nation, and, that, the, leader, proposes, that, only, he, can, solve, it, and, all, of, his, political, opponents, are, enemies, or, traitors, stanley, says, recent, global, events, as, of, 2020, including, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, the, 2020, 2022, united, states, racial, unrest, have, substantiated, his, concern, about, how, fascist, rhetoric, is, showing, up, in, politics, and, policies, around, the, world, roger, griffin, describes, fascism, as, a, genus, of, political, ideology, whose, mythic, core, in, its, various, permutations, is, a, palingenetic, form, of, populist, ultranationalism, without, palingenetic, ultranationalism, there, is, no, genuine, fascism, according, to, griffin, griffin, further, describes, fascism, as, having, three, core, components, i, the, rebirth, myth, ii, populist, ultra, nationalism, and, iii, the, myth, of, decadence, in, griffin, s, view, fascism, is, a, genuinely, revolutionary, trans, class, form, of, anti, liberal, and, in, the, last, analysis, anti, conservative, nationalism, built, on, a, complex, range, of, theoretical, and, cultural, influences, he, distinguishes, an, inter, war, period, in, which, it, manifested, itself, in, elite, led, but, populist, armed, party, politics, opposing, socialism, and, liberalism, and, promising, radical, politics, to, rescue, the, nation, from, decadence, kershaw, argues, that, the, difference, between, fascism, and, other, forms, of, right, wing, authoritarianism, in, the, interwar, period, is, that, the, latter, generally, aimed, to, conserve, the, existing, social, order, whereas, fascism, was, revolutionary, seeking, to, change, society, and, obtain, total, commitment, from, the, population, in, against, the, fascist, creep, alexander, reid, ross, writes, regarding, griffin, s, view, following, the, cold, war, and, shifts, in, fascist, organizing, techniques, a, number, of, scholars, have, moved, toward, the, minimalist, new, consensus, refined, by, roger, griffin, the, mythic, core, of, fascism, is, a, populist, form, of, palingenetic, ultranationalism, that, means, that, fascism, is, an, ideology, that, draws, on, old, ancient, and, even, arcane, myths, of, racial, cultural, ethnic, and, national, origins, to, develop, a, plan, for, the, new, man, griffin, himself, explored, this, mythic, or, eliminable, core, of, fascism, with, his, concept, of, post, fascism, to, explore, the, continuation, of, nazism, in, the, modern, era, additionally, other, historians, have, applied, this, minimalist, core, to, explore, proto, fascist, movements, cas, mudde, and, crist, bal, rovira, kaltwasser, argue, that, although, fascism, flirted, with, populism, in, an, attempt, to, generate, mass, support, it, is, better, seen, as, an, elitist, ideology, they, cite, in, particular, its, exaltation, of, the, leader, the, race, and, the, state, rather, than, the, people, they, see, populism, as, a, thin, centered, ideology, with, a, restricted, morphology, that, necessarily, becomes, attached, to, thick, centered, ideologies, such, as, fascism, liberalism, or, socialism, thus, populism, can, be, found, as, an, aspect, of, many, specific, ideologies, without, necessarily, being, a, defining, characteristic, of, those, ideologies, they, refer, to, the, combination, of, populism, authoritarianism, and, ultranationalism, as, a, marriage, of, convenience, robert, paxton, says, a, form, of, political, behavior, marked, by, obsessive, preoccupation, with, community, decline, humiliation, or, victimhood, and, by, compensatory, cults, of, unity, energy, and, purity, in, which, a, mass, based, party, of, committed, nationalist, militants, working, in, uneasy, but, effective, collaboration, with, traditional, elites, abandons, democratic, liberties, and, pursues, with, redemptive, violence, and, without, ethical, or, legal, restraints, goals, of, internal, cleansing, and, external, expansion, roger, eatwell, defines, fascism, as, an, ideology, that, strives, to, forge, social, rebirth, based, on, a, holistic, national, radical, third, way, while, walter, laqueur, sees, the, core, tenets, of, fascism, as, self, evident, nationalism, social, darwinism, racialism, the, need, for, leadership, a, new, aristocracy, and, obedience, and, the, negation, of, the, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, and, the, french, revolution, historian, emilio, gentile, has, defined, fascism, as, a, modern, political, phenomenon, revolutionary, anti, liberal, and, anti, marxist, organized, in, a, militia, party, with, a, totalitarian, conception, of, politics, and, the, state, an, activist, and, anti, theoretical, ideology, with, a, mythical, virilistic, and, anti, hedonistic, foundation, sacralized, as, a, secular, religion, which, affirms, the, absolute, primacy, of, the, nation, understood, as, an, ethnically, homogeneous, organic, community, hierarchically, organized, in, a, corporate, state, with, a, bellicose, vocation, to, the, politics, of, greatness, power, and, conquest, aimed, at, creating, a, new, order, and, a, new, civilization, historian, and, cultural, critic, ruth, ben, ghiat, has, described, fascism, as, the, original, phase, of, authoritarianism, along, with, early, communism, when, a, population, has, undergone, huge, dislocations, or, they, perceive, that, there, s, been, changes, in, society, that, are, very, rapid, too, rapid, for, their, taste, racism, was, a, key, feature, of, german, fascism, for, which, the, holocaust, was, a, high, priority, according, to, the, historiography, of, genocide, in, dealing, with, the, holocaust, it, is, the, consensus, of, historians, that, nazi, germany, targeted, jews, as, a, race, not, as, a, religious, group, umberto, eco, kevin, passmore, john, weiss, ian, adams, and, moyra, grant, stress, racism, as, a, characteristic, component, of, german, fascism, historian, robert, soucy, stated, that, hitler, envisioned, the, ideal, german, society, as, a, volksgemeinschaft, a, racially, unified, and, hierarchically, organized, body, in, which, the, interests, of, individuals, would, be, strictly, subordinate, to, those, of, the, nation, or, volk, kershaw, noted, that, common, factors, of, fascism, included, the, cleansing, of, all, those, deemed, not, to, belong, foreigners, ethnic, minorities, undesirables, and, belief, in, its, own, nation, s, superiority, even, if, it, was, not, biological, racism, like, in, nazism, fascist, philosophies, vary, by, application, but, remain, distinct, by, one, theoretical, commonality, all, traditionally, fall, into, the, far, right, sector, of, any, political, spectrum, catalyzed, by, afflicted, class, identities, over, conventional, social, inequities, scholars, place, fascism, on, the, far, right, of, the, political, spectrum, such, scholarship, focuses, on, its, social, conservatism, and, its, authoritarian, means, of, opposing, egalitarianism, roderick, stackelberg, places, fascism, including, nazism, which, he, says, is, a, radical, variant, of, fascism, on, the, political, right, by, explaining, the, more, a, person, deems, absolute, equality, among, all, people, to, be, a, desirable, condition, the, further, left, he, or, she, will, be, on, the, ideological, spectrum, the, more, a, person, considers, inequality, to, be, unavoidable, or, even, desirable, the, further, to, the, right, he, or, she, will, be, fascism, s, origins, are, complex, and, include, many, seemingly, contradictory, viewpoints, ultimately, centered, on, a, mythos, of, national, rebirth, from, decadence, fascism, was, founded, during, world, war, i, by, italian, national, syndicalists, who, drew, upon, both, left, wing, organizational, tactics, and, right, wing, political, views, italian, fascism, gravitated, to, the, right, in, the, early, 1920s, a, major, element, of, fascist, ideology, that, has, been, deemed, to, be, far, right, is, its, stated, goal, to, promote, the, right, of, a, supposedly, superior, people, to, dominate, while, purging, society, of, supposedly, inferior, elements, in, the, 1920s, mussolini, and, giovanni, gentile, described, their, ideology, as, right, wing, in, the, political, essay, the, doctrine, of, fascism, stating, we, are, free, to, believe, that, this, is, the, century, of, authority, a, century, tending, to, the, right, a, fascist, century, mussolini, stated, that, fascism, s, position, on, the, political, spectrum, was, not, a, serious, issue, for, fascists, fascism, sitting, on, the, right, could, also, have, sat, on, the, mountain, of, the, center, these, words, in, any, case, do, not, have, a, fixed, and, unchanged, meaning, they, do, have, a, variable, subject, to, location, time, and, spirit, we, don, t, give, a, damn, about, these, empty, terminologies, and, we, despise, those, who, are, terrorized, by, these, words, major, italian, groups, politically, on, the, right, especially, rich, landowners, and, big, business, feared, an, uprising, by, groups, on, the, left, such, as, sharecroppers, and, labour, unions, they, welcomed, fascism, and, supported, its, violent, suppression, of, opponents, on, the, left, the, accommodation, of, the, political, right, into, the, italian, fascist, movement, in, the, early, 1920s, created, internal, factions, within, the, movement, the, fascist, left, included, michele, bianchi, giuseppe, bottai, angelo, oliviero, olivetti, sergio, panunzio, and, edmondo, rossoni, who, were, committed, to, advancing, national, syndicalism, as, a, replacement, for, parliamentary, liberalism, in, order, to, modernize, the, economy, and, advance, the, interests, of, workers, and, the, common, people, the, fascist, right, included, members, of, the, paramilitary, blackshirts, and, former, members, of, the, italian, nationalist, association, ani, the, blackshirts, wanted, to, establish, fascism, as, a, complete, dictatorship, while, the, former, ani, members, including, alfredo, rocco, sought, to, institute, an, authoritarian, corporatist, state, to, replace, the, liberal, state, in, italy, while, retaining, the, existing, elites, upon, accommodating, the, political, right, there, arose, a, group, of, monarchist, fascists, who, sought, to, use, fascism, to, create, an, absolute, monarchy, under, king, victor, emmanuel, iii, of, italy, a, number, of, post, world, war, ii, fascist, movements, described, themselves, as, a, third, position, outside, the, traditional, political, spectrum, falange, espa, ola, de, las, jons, leader, jos, antonio, primo, de, rivera, said, asically, the, right, stands, for, the, maintenance, of, an, economic, structure, albeit, an, unjust, one, while, the, left, stands, for, the, attempt, to, subvert, that, economic, structure, even, though, the, subversion, thereof, would, entail, the, destruction, of, much, that, was, worthwhile, the, term, fascist, has, been, used, as, a, pejorative, regarding, varying, movements, across, the, far, right, of, the, political, spectrum, george, orwell, noted, in, 1944, that, the, term, had, been, used, to, denigrate, diverse, positions, in, internal, politics, while, fascism, is, a, political, and, economic, system, that, was, inconvenient, to, define, as, used, the, word, fascism, is, almost, entirely, meaningless, almost, any, english, person, would, accept, bully, as, a, synonym, for, fascist, and, in, 1946, wrote, that, fascism, has, now, no, meaning, except, in, so, far, as, it, signifies, something, not, desirable, richard, griffiths, of, the, university, of, wales, wrote, in, 2000, that, fascism, is, the, most, misused, and, over, used, word, of, our, times, 1, fascist, is, sometimes, applied, to, post, world, war, ii, organizations, and, ways, of, thinking, that, academics, more, commonly, term, neo, fascist, despite, fascist, movements, history, of, anti, communism, communist, states, have, sometimes, been, referred, to, as, fascist, typically, as, an, insult, it, has, been, applied, to, marxist, leninist, regimes, in, cuba, under, fidel, castro, and, vietnam, under, ho, chi, minh, chinese, marxists, used, the, term, to, denounce, the, soviet, union, during, the, sino, soviet, split, and, the, soviets, used, the, term, to, denounce, chinese, marxists, and, social, democracy, coining, a, new, term, in, social, fascism, in, the, united, states, herbert, matthews, of, the, new, york, times, asked, in, 1946, should, we, now, place, stalinist, russia, in, the, same, category, as, hitlerite, germany, should, we, say, that, she, is, fascist, j, edgar, hoover, longtime, fbi, director, and, ardent, anti, communist, wrote, extensively, of, red, fascism, the, ku, klux, klan, in, the, 1920s, was, sometimes, called, fascist, historian, peter, amann, states, that, undeniably, the, klan, had, some, traits, in, common, with, european, fascism, chauvinism, racism, a, mystique, of, violence, an, affirmation, of, a, certain, kind, of, archaic, traditionalism, yet, their, differences, were, fundamental, never, envisioned, a, change, of, political, or, economic, system, early, influences, that, shaped, the, ideology, of, fascism, have, been, dated, back, to, ancient, greece, the, political, culture, of, ancient, greece, and, specifically, the, ancient, greek, city, state, of, sparta, under, lycurgus, with, its, emphasis, on, militarism, and, racial, purity, were, admired, by, the, nazis, nazi, f, hrer, adolf, hitler, emphasized, that, germany, should, adhere, to, hellenic, values, and, culture, particularly, that, of, ancient, sparta, georges, valois, founder, of, the, first, non, italian, fascist, party, faisceau, claimed, the, roots, of, fascism, stemmed, from, the, late, 18th, century, jacobin, movement, seeing, in, its, totalitarian, nature, a, foreshadowing, of, the, fascist, state, historian, george, mosse, similarly, analyzed, fascism, as, an, inheritor, of, the, mass, ideology, and, civil, religion, of, the, french, revolution, as, well, as, a, result, of, the, brutalization, of, societies, in, 1914, 1918, historians, such, as, irene, collins, and, howard, c, payne, see, napoleon, iii, who, ran, a, police, state, and, suppressed, the, media, as, a, forerunner, of, fascism, according, to, david, thomson, the, italian, risorgimento, of, 1871, led, to, the, nemesis, of, fascism, william, l, shirer, sees, a, continuity, from, the, views, of, fichte, and, hegel, through, bismarck, to, hitler, robert, gerwarth, speaks, of, a, direct, line, from, bismarck, to, hitler, julian, dierkes, sees, fascism, as, a, particularly, violent, form, of, imperialism, marcus, garvey, founder, and, leader, of, the, universal, negro, improvement, association, insisted, that, he, and, his, organisation, were, the, first, fascists, in, 1938, c, l, r, james, wrote, all, the, things, that, hitler, was, to, do, so, well, later, marcus, garvey, was, doing, in, 1920, and, 1921, the, historian, zeev, sternhell, has, traced, the, ideological, roots, of, fascism, back, to, the, 1880s, and, in, particular, to, the, fin, de, si, cle, theme, of, that, time, the, theme, was, based, on, a, revolt, against, materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois, society, and, democracy, the, fin, de, si, cle, generation, supported, emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and, vitalism, they, regarded, civilization, as, being, in, crisis, requiring, a, massive, and, total, solution, their, intellectual, school, considered, the, individual, as, only, one, part, of, the, larger, collectivity, which, should, not, be, viewed, as, a, numerical, sum, of, atomized, individuals, they, condemned, the, rationalistic, liberal, individualism, of, society, and, the, dissolution, of, social, links, in, bourgeois, society, the, fin, de, si, cle, outlook, was, influenced, by, various, intellectual, developments, including, darwinian, biology, gesamtkunstwerk, arthur, de, gobineau, s, racialism, gustave, le, bon, s, psychology, and, the, philosophies, of, friedrich, nietzsche, fyodor, dostoyevsky, and, henri, bergson, social, darwinism, which, gained, widespread, acceptance, made, no, distinction, between, physical, and, social, life, and, viewed, the, human, condition, as, being, an, unceasing, struggle, to, achieve, the, survival, of, the, fittest, it, challenged, positivism, s, claim, of, deliberate, and, rational, choice, as, the, determining, behaviour, of, humans, with, social, darwinism, focusing, on, heredity, race, and, environment, its, emphasis, on, biogroup, identity, and, the, role, of, organic, relations, within, societies, fostered, the, legitimacy, and, appeal, of, nationalism, new, theories, of, social, and, political, psychology, also, rejected, the, notion, of, human, behaviour, being, governed, by, rational, choice, and, instead, claimed, that, emotion, was, more, influential, in, political, issues, than, reason, nietzsche, s, argument, that, god, is, dead, coincided, with, his, attack, on, the, herd, mentality, of, christianity, democracy, and, modern, collectivism, his, concept, of, the, bermensch, and, his, advocacy, of, the, will, to, power, as, a, primordial, instinct, were, major, influences, upon, many, of, the, fin, de, si, cle, generation, bergson, s, claim, of, the, existence, of, an, lan, vital, or, vital, instinct, centred, upon, free, choice, and, rejected, the, processes, of, materialism, and, determinism, this, challenged, marxism, in, his, work, the, ruling, class, 1896, gaetano, mosca, developed, the, theory, that, claims, that, in, all, societies, an, organized, minority, would, dominate, and, rule, over, an, disorganized, majority, stating, that, there, are, only, two, classes, in, society, the, governing, the, organized, minority, and, the, governed, the, disorganized, majority, he, claims, that, the, organized, nature, of, the, organized, minority, makes, it, irresistible, to, any, individual, of, the, disorganized, majority, french, nationalist, and, reactionary, monarchist, charles, maurras, influenced, fascism, maurras, promoted, what, he, called, integral, nationalism, which, called, for, the, organic, unity, of, a, nation, and, insisted, that, a, powerful, monarch, was, an, ideal, leader, of, a, nation, maurras, distrusted, what, he, considered, the, democratic, mystification, of, the, popular, will, that, created, an, impersonal, collective, subject, he, claimed, that, a, powerful, monarch, was, a, personified, sovereign, who, could, exercise, authority, to, unite, a, nation, s, people, maurras, integral, nationalism, was, idealized, by, fascists, but, modified, into, a, modernized, revolutionary, form, that, was, devoid, of, maurras, monarchism, french, revolutionary, syndicalist, georges, sorel, promoted, the, legitimacy, of, political, violence, in, his, work, reflections, on, violence, 1908, and, other, works, in, which, he, advocated, radical, syndicalist, action, to, achieve, a, revolution, to, overthrow, capitalism, and, the, bourgeoisie, through, a, general, strike, in, reflections, on, violence, sorel, emphasized, need, for, a, revolutionary, political, religion, also, in, his, work, the, illusions, of, progress, sorel, denounced, democracy, as, reactionary, saying, nothing, is, more, aristocratic, than, democracy, by, 1909, after, the, failure, of, a, syndicalist, general, strike, in, france, sorel, and, his, supporters, left, the, radical, left, and, went, to, the, radical, right, where, they, sought, to, merge, militant, catholicism, and, french, patriotism, with, their, views, advocating, anti, republican, christian, french, patriots, as, ideal, revolutionaries, initially, sorel, had, officially, been, a, revisionist, of, marxism, but, by, 1910, announced, his, abandonment, of, socialist, literature, and, claimed, in, 1914, using, an, aphorism, of, benedetto, croce, that, socialism, is, dead, because, of, the, decomposition, of, marxism, sorel, became, a, supporter, of, reactionary, maurrassian, nationalism, beginning, in, 1909, that, influenced, his, works, maurras, held, interest, in, merging, his, nationalist, ideals, with, sorelian, syndicalism, known, as, sorelianism, as, a, means, to, confront, democracy, maurras, stated, that, a, socialism, liberated, from, the, democratic, and,

marinetti, rejected, conventional, democracy, based, on, majority, rule, and, egalitarianism, for, a, new, form, of, democracy, promoting, what, he, described, in, his, work, the, futurist, conception, of, democracy, as, the, following, we, are, therefore, able, to, give, the, directions, to, create, and, to, dismantle, to, numbers, to, quantity, to, the, mass, for, with, us, number,

revolutionary, action, the, first, meeting, of, the, fasces, of, revolutionary, action, was, held, on, 24, january, 1915, when, mussolini, declared, that, it, was, necessary, for, europe, to, resolve, its, national, problems, including, national, borders, of, italy, and, elsewhere, for, the, ideals, of, justice, and, liberty, for, which, oppressed, peoples, must, acquire, the, right, to, belong,

within, what, he, termed, the, ideas, of, 1914, that, were, a, declaration, of, war, against, the, ideas, of, 1789, the, french, revolution, according, to, plenge, the, ideas, of, 1789, such, as, the, rights, of, man, democracy, individualism, and, liberalism, were, being, rejected, in, favor, of, the, ideas, of, 1914, that, included, german, values, of, duty, discipline, law, and, order, plenge, believed, that, racial, solidarity, volksgemeinschaft, would, replace, class, division, and, that, racial, comrades, would, unite, to, create, a, socialist, society, in, the, struggle, of, proletarian, germany, against, capitalist, britain, he, believed, that, the, spirit, of, 1914, manifested, itself, in, the, concept, of, the, people, s, league, of, national, socialism, this, national, socialism, was, a, form, of, state, socialism, that, rejected, the, idea, of, boundless, freedom, and, promoted, an, economy, that, would, serve, the, whole, of, germany, under, the, leadership, of, the, state, this, national, socialism, was, opposed, to, capitalism, because, of, the, components, that, were, against, the, national, interest, of, germany, but, insisted, that, national, socialism, would, strive, for, greater, efficiency, in, the, economy, plenge, advocated, an, authoritarian, rational, ruling, elite, to, develop, national, socialism, through, a, hierarchical, technocratic, state, fascists, viewed, world, war, i, as, bringing, revolutionary, changes, in, the, nature, of, war, society, the, state, and, technology, as, the, advent, of, total, war, and, mass, mobilization, had, broken, down, the, distinction, between, civilian, and, combatant, as, civilians, had, become, a, critical, part, in, economic, production, for, the, war, effort, and, thus, arose, a, military, citizenship, in, which, all, citizens, were, involved, to, the, military, in, some, manner, during, the, war, world, war, i, had, resulted, in, the, rise, of, a, powerful, state, capable, of, mobilizing, millions, of, people, to, serve, on, the, front, lines, or, provide, economic, production, and, logistics, to, support, those, on, the, front, lines, as, well, as, having, unprecedented, authority, to, intervene, in, the, lives, of, citizens, fascists, viewed, technological, developments, of, weaponry, and, the, state, s, total, mobilization, of, its, population, in, the, war, as, symbolizing, the, beginning, of, a, new, era, fusing, state, power, with, mass, politics, technology, and, particularly, the, mobilizing, myth, that, they, contended, had, triumphed, over, the, myth, of, progress, and, the, era, of, liberalism, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, in, which, bolshevik, communists, led, by, vladimir, lenin, seized, power, in, russia, greatly, influenced, the, development, of, fascism, leon, trotsky, would, later, formulate, a, theory, of, fascism, based, on, a, dialectical, interpretation, of, events, to, analyze, the, manifestation, of, italian, fascism, and, the, early, emergence, of, nazi, germany, from, 1930, to, 1933, in, 1917, mussolini, as, leader, of, the, fasces, of, revolutionary, action, praised, the, october, revolution, but, later, he, became, unimpressed, with, lenin, regarding, him, as, merely, a, new, version, of, tsar, nicholas, ii, after, world, war, i, fascists, commonly, campaigned, on, anti, marxist, agendas, liberal, opponents, of, both, fascism, and, the, bolsheviks, argue, that, there, are, various, similarities, between, the, two, including, that, they, believed, in, the, necessity, of, a, vanguard, leadership, showed, contempt, for, bourgeois, values, and, had, totalitarian, ambitions, in, practice, both, have, commonly, emphasized, revolutionary, action, proletarian, nation, theories, one, party, states, and, party, armies, however, both, draw, clear, distinctions, from, each, other, both, in, aims, and, tactics, with, the, bolsheviks, emphasizing, the, need, for, an, organized, participatory, democracy, soviet, democracy, and, an, egalitarian, internationalist, vision, for, society, based, on, proletarian, internationalism, while, fascists, emphasized, hyper, nationalism, and, open, hostility, towards, democracy, envisioning, a, hierarchical, social, structure, as, essential, to, their, aims, with, the, antagonism, between, anti, interventionist, marxists, and, pro, interventionist, fascists, complete, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, two, sides, became, irreconcilable, the, fascists, presented, themselves, as, anti, communists, and, as, especially, opposed, to, the, marxists, in, 1919, mussolini, consolidated, control, over, the, fascist, movement, known, as, sansepolcrismo, with, the, founding, of, the, italian, fasces, of, combat, in, 1919,

the, subsequent, local, support, for, the, fascist, party, in, the, early, 1920s, according, to, the, authors, it, was, local, elites, and, large, landowners, who, played, an, important, role, in,

treaty, which, gave, the, papacy, state, sovereignty, and, financial, compensation, for, the, seizure, of, church, lands, by, the, liberal, state, in, the, 19th, century, but, within, two, years, the, church, had, renounced, fascism, in, the, encyclical, non, abbiamo, bisogno, as, a, pagan, idolatry, of, the, state, which, teaches, hatred, violence, and, irreverence, not, long, after, signing, the, agreement, by, mussolini, s, own, confession, the, church, had, threatened, to, have, him, excommunicated, in, part, because, of, his, intractable, nature, but, also, because, he, had, confiscated, more, issues, of, catholic, newspapers, in, the, next, three, months, than, in, the, previous, seven, years, by, the, late, 1930s, mussolini, became, more, vocal, in, his, anti, clerical, rhetoric, repeatedly, denouncing, the, catholic, church, and, discussing, ways, to, depose, the, pope, he, took, the, position, that, the, papacy, was, a, malignant, tumor, in, the, body, of, italy, and, must, be, rooted, out, once, and, for, all, because, there, was, no, room, in, rome, for, both, the, pope, and, himself, in, her, 1974, book, mussolini, s, widow, rachele, stated, that, her, husband, had,

crisis, between, germany, versus, britain, and, france, over, claims, on, czechoslovakia, by, arranging, the, munich, agreement, that, gave, germany, the, sudetenland, and, was, perceived, at, the, time, to, have, averted, a, european, war, these, hopes, faded, when, czechoslovakia, was, dissolved, by, the, proclamation, of, the, german, client, state, of, slovakia, followed, by, the, next, day,

several, nazi, leaders, of, crimes, against, humanity, involving, the, holocaust, however, there, remained, several, movements, and, governments, that, were, ideologically, related, to, fascism, francisco, franco, s, falangist, one, party, state, in, spain, was, officially, neutral, during, world, war, ii, although, franco, s, rise, to, power, had, been, directly, assisted, by, the, militaries, of, fascist, italy, and, nazi, germany, during, the, spanish, civil, war, the, first, years, were, characterized, by, a, repression, against, the, anti, fascist, ideologies, deep, censorship, and, the, suppression, of, democratic, institutions, elected, parliament, spanish, constitution, of, 1931, regional, statutes, of, autonomy, after, world, war, ii, and, a, period, of, international, isolation, franco, s, regime, normalized, relations, with, the, western, powers, during, the, cold, war, until, franco, s, death, in, 1975, and, the, transformation, of, spain, into, a, liberal, democracy, historian, robert, paxton, observes, that, one, of, the, main, problems, in, defining, fascism, is, that, it, was, widely, mimicked, paxton, says, in, fascism, s, heyday, in, the, 1930s, many, regimes, that, were, not, functionally, fascist, borrowed, elements, of, fascist, decor, in, order, to, lend, themselves, an, aura, of, force, vitality, and, mass, mobilization, he, goes, on, to, observe, that, salazar, crushed, portuguese, fascism, after, he, had, copied, some, of, its, techniques, of, popular, mobilization, paxton, says, where, franco, subjected, spain, s, fascist, party, to, his, personal, control, salazar, abolished, outright, in, july, 1934, the, nearest, thing, portugal, had, to, an, authentic, fascist, movement, rol, o, preto, s, blue, shirted, national, syndicalists, salazar, preferred, to, control, his, population, through, such, organic, institutions, traditionally, powerful, in, portugal, as, the, church, salazar, s, regime, was, not, only, non, fascist, but, voluntarily, non, totalitarian, preferring, to, let, those, of, its, citizens, who, kept, out, of, politics, live, by, habit, however, historians, tend, to, view, the, estado, novo, as, para, fascist, in, nature, possessing, minimal, fascist, tendencies, other, historians, including, fernando, rosas, and, manuel, villaverde, cabral, think, that, the, estado, novo, should, be, considered, fascist, in, argentina, peronism, associated, with, the, regime, of, juan, per, n, from, 1946, to, 1955, and, 1973, to, 1974, was, influenced, by, fascism, between, 1939, and, 1941, prior, to, his, rise, to, power, per, n, had, developed, a, deep, admiration, of, italian, fascism, and, modelled, his, economic, policies, on, italian, fascist, policies, however, not, all, historians, agree, with, this, identification, which, they, consider, debatable, or, even, false, biased, by, a, pejorative, political, position, other, authors, such, as, the, israeli, raanan, rein, categorically, maintain, that, per, n, was, not, a, fascist, and, that, this, characterization, was, imposed, on, him, because, of, his, defiant, stance, against, us, hegemony, the, term, neo, fascism, refers, to, fascist, movements, after, world, war, ii, in, italy, the, italian, social, movement, led, by, giorgio, almirante, was, a, major, neo, fascist, movement, that, transformed, itself, into, a, self, described, post, fascist, movement, called, the, national, alliance, an, which, has, been, an, ally, of, silvio, berlusconi, s, forza, italia, for, a, decade, in, 2008, an, joined, forza, italia, in, berlusconi, s, new, party, the, people, of, freedom, but, in, 2012, a, group, of, politicians, split, from, the, people, of, freedom, refounding, the, party, with, the, name, brothers, of, italy, in, germany, various, neo, nazi, movements, have, been, formed, and, banned, in, accordance, with, germany, s, constitutional, law, which, forbids, nazism, the, national, democratic, party, of, germany, npd, is, widely, considered, a, neo, nazi, party, although, the, party, does, not, publicly, identify, itself, as, such, after, the, onset, of, the, great, recession, and, economic, crisis, in, greece, a, movement, known, as, the, golden, dawn, widely, considered, a, neo, nazi, party, soared, in, support, out, of, obscurity, and, won, seats, in, greece, s, parliament, espousing, a, staunch, hostility, towards, minorities, illegal, immigrants, and, refugees, in, 2013, after, the, murder, of, an, anti, fascist, musician, by, a, person, with, links, to, golden, dawn, the, greek, government, ordered, the, arrest, of, golden, dawn, s, leader, nikolaos, michaloliakos, and, other, members, on, charges, related, to, being, associated, with, a, criminal,

murder, and, violent, attacks, on, immigrants, and, left, wing, political, opponents, marlene, laruelle, a, french, political, scientist, contends, in, is, russia, fascist, that, the, accusation, of, fascist, has, evolved, into, a, strategic, narrative, of, the, existing, world, order, geopolitical, rivals, might, construct, their, own, view, of, the, world, and, assert, the, moral, high, ground, by, branding, ideological, rivals, as, fascists, regardless, of, their, real, ideals, or, deeds, laruelle, discusses, the, basis, significance, and, veracity, of, accusations, of, fascism, in, and, around, russia, through, an, analysis, of, the, domestic, situation, in, russia, and, the, kremlin, s, foreign, policy, justifications, she, concludes, that, russian, efforts, to, brand, its, opponents, as, fascist, is, ultimately, an, attempt, to, determine, the, future, of, russia, in, europe, as, an, antifascist, force, influenced, by, its, role, in, fighting, fascism, in, world, war, ii, according, to, alexander, j, motyl, an, american, historian, and, political, scientist, russian, fascism, has, the, following, characteristics, yale, historian, timothy, snyder, has, stated, that, putin, s, regime, is, the, world, center, of, fascism, and, has, written, an, article, entitled, we, should, say, it, russia, is, fascist, oxford, historian, roger, griffin, compared, putin, s, russia, to, the, world, war, ii, era, empire, of, japan, saying, that, like, putin, s, russia, it, emulated, fascism, in, many, ways, but, was, not, fascist, historian, stanley, g, payne, says, putin, s, russia, is, not, equivalent, to, the, fascist, regimes, of, world, war, ii, but, it, forms, the, nearest, analogue, to, fascism, found, in, a, major, country, since, that, time, and, argues, that, putin, s, political, system, is, more, a, revival, of, the, creed, of, tsar, nicholas, i, in, the, 19th, century, that, emphasized, orthodoxy, autocracy, and, nationality, than, one, resembling, the, revolutionary, modernizing, regimes, of, hitler, and, mussolini, according, to, griffin, fascism, is, a, revolutionary, form, of, nationalism, seeking, to, destroy, the, old, system, and, remake, society, and, that, putin, is, a, reactionary, politician, who, is, not, trying, to, create, a, new, order, but, to, recreate, a, modified, version, of, the, soviet, union, german, political, scientist, andreas, umland, said, genuine, fascists, in, russia, like, deceased, politician, vladimir, zhirinovsky, and, activist, and, self, styled, philosopher, aleksandr, dugin, describe, in, their, writings, a, completely, new, russia, controlling, parts, of, the, world, that, were, never, under, tsarist, or, soviet, domination, according, to, marlene, laurelle, writing, in, the, washington, quarterly, applying, the, fascism, label, to, the, entirety, of, the, russian, state, or, society, short, circuits, our, ability, to, construct, a, more, complex, and, differentiated, picture, radio, free, europe, radio, liberty, collecting, the, opinions, of, experts, on, fascism, said, that, while, russia, is, repressive, and, authoritarian, it, cannot, be, classified, as, a, fascist, state, for, various, reasons, including, russia, s, government, being, more, reactionary, than, revolutionary, in, 2023, oleg, orlov, the, chairman, of, the, board, of, human, rights, center, memorial, claimed, that, russia, under, vladimir, putin, had, descended, into, fascism, and, that, the, army, is, committing, mass, murder, on, 7, march, 2024, in, his, 2024, state, of, the, union, address, american, president, joe, biden, compared, russia, under, vladimir, putin, to, adolf, hitler, s, conquests, of, europe, robert, o, paxton, finds, that, even, though, fascism, maintained, the, existing, regime, of, property, and, social, hierarchy, it, cannot, be, considered, simply, a, more, muscular, form, of, conservatism, because, fascism, in, power, did, carry, out, some, changes, profound, enough, to, be, called, revolutionary, these, transformations, often, set, fascists, into, conflict, with, conservatives, rooted, in, families, churches, social, rank, and, property, paxton, argues, fascism, redrew, the, frontiers, between, private, and, public, sharply, diminishing, what, had, once, been, untouchably, private, it, changed, the, practice, of, citizenship, from, the, enjoyment, of, constitutional, rights, and, duties, to, participation, in, mass, ceremonies, of, affirmation, and, conformity, it, reconfigured, relations, between, the, individual, and, the, collectivity, so, that, an, individual, had, no, rights, outside, community, interest, it, expanded, the, powers, of, the, executive, party, and, state, in, a, bid, for, total, control, finally, it, unleashed, aggressive, emotions, hitherto, known, in, europe, only, during, war, or, social, revolution, ultranationalism, combined, with, the, myth, of, national, rebirth, is, a, key, foundation, of, fascism, robert, paxton, argues, that, a, passionate, nationalism, is, the, basis, of, fascism, combined, with, a, conspiratorial, and, manichean, view, of, history, which, holds, that, the, chosen, people, have, been, weakened, by, political, parties, social, classes, unassimilable, minorities, spoiled, rentiers, and, rationalist, thinkers, roger, griffin, identifies, the, core, of, fascism, as, being, palingenetic, ultranationalism, the, fascist, view, of, a, nation, is, of, a, single, organic, entity, that, binds, people, together, by, their, ancestry, and, is, a, natural, unifying, force, of, people, fascism, seeks, to, solve, economic, political, and, social, problems, by, achieving, a, millenarian, national, rebirth, exalting, the, nation, or, race, above, all, else, and, promoting, cults, of, unity, strength, and, purity, european, fascist, movements, typically, espouse, a, racist, conception, of, non, europeans, being, inferior, to, europeans, beyond, this, fascists, in, europe, have, not, held, a, unified, set, of, racial, views, historically, most, fascists, promoted, imperialism, although, there, have, been, several, fascist, movements, that, were, uninterested, in, the, pursuit, of, new, imperial, ambitions, for, example, nazism, and, italian, fascism, were, expansionist, and, irredentist, falangism, in, spain, envisioned, the, worldwide, unification, of, spanish, speaking, peoples, hispanidad, british, fascism, was, non, interventionist, though, it, did, embrace, the, british, empire, fascism, promotes, the, establishment, of, a, totalitarian, state, it, opposes, liberal, democracy, rejects, multi, party, systems, and, may, support, a, one, party, state, so, that, it, may, synthesize, with, the, nation, mussolini, s, the, doctrine, of, fascism, 1932, partly, ghostwritten, by, philosopher, giovanni, gentile, who, mussolini, described, as, the, philosopher, of, fascism, states, the, fascist, conception, of, the, state, is, all, embracing, outside, of, it, no, human, or, spiritual, values, can, exist, much, less, have, value, thus, understood, fascism, is, totalitarian, and, the, fascist, state, a, synthesis, and, a, unit, inclusive, of, all, values, interprets, develops, and, potentiates, the, whole, life, of, a, people, in, the, legal, basis, of, the, total, state, nazi, political, theorist, carl, schmitt, described, the, nazi, intention, to, form, a, strong, state, which, guarantees, a, totality, of, political, unity, transcending, all, diversity, in, order, to, avoid, a, disastrous, pluralism, tearing, the, german, people, apart, fascist, states, pursued, policies, of, social, indoctrination, through, propaganda, in, education, and, the, media, and, regulation, of, the, production, of, educational, and, media, materials, education, was, designed, to, glorify, the, fascist, movement, and, inform, students, of, its, historical, and, political, importance, to, the, nation, it, attempted, to, purge, ideas, that, were, not, consistent, with, the, beliefs, of, the, fascist, movement, and, to, teach, students, to, be, obedient, to, the, state, fascism, presented, itself, as, an, alternative, to, both, international, socialism, and, free, market, capitalism, while, fascism, opposed, mainstream, socialism, fascists, sometimes, regarded, their, movement, as, a, type, of, nationalist, socialism, to, highlight, their, commitment, to, nationalism, describing, it, as, national, solidarity, and, unity, fascists, opposed, international, free, market, capitalism, but, supported, a, type, of, productive, capitalism, economic, self, sufficiency, known, as, autarky, was, a, major, goal, of, most, fascist, governments, fascist, governments, advocated, for, the, resolution, of, domestic, class, conflict, within, a, nation, in, order, to, guarantee, national, unity, this, would, be, done, through, the, state, mediating, relations, between, the, classes, contrary, to, the, views, of, classical, liberal, inspired, capitalists, while, fascism, was, opposed, to, domestic, class, conflict, it, was, held, that, bourgeois, proletarian, conflict, existed, primarily, in, national, conflict, between, proletarian, nations, versus, bourgeois, nations, fascism, condemned, what, it, viewed, as, widespread, character, traits, that, it, associated, as, the, typical, bourgeois, mentality, that, it, opposed, such, as, materialism, crassness, cowardice, and, the, inability, to, comprehend, the, heroic, ideal, of, the, fascist, warrior, and, associations, with, liberalism, individualism, and, parliamentarianism, in, 1918, mussolini, defined, what, he, viewed, as, the, proletarian, character, defining, proletarian, as, being, one, and, the, same, with, producers, a, productivist, perspective, that, associated, all, people, deemed, productive, including, entrepreneurs, technicians, workers, and, soldiers, as, being, proletarian, because, productivism, was, key, to, creating, a, strong, nationalist, state, it, criticized, internationalist, and, marxist, socialism, advocating, instead, to, represent, a, type, of, nationalist, productivist, socialism, nevertheless, while, condemning, parasitical, capitalism, was, willing, to, accommodate, productivist, capitalism, within, it, so, long, as, it, supported, the, nationalist, objective, the, role, of, productivism, was, derived, from, henri, de, saint, simon, whose, ideas, inspired, the, creation, of, utopian, socialism, and, influenced, other, ideologies, that, stressed, solidarity, rather, than, class, war, and, whose, conception, of, productive, people, in, the, economy, included, both, productive, workers, and, productive, bosses, to, challenge, the, influence, of, the, aristocracy, and, unproductive, financial, speculators, saint, simon, s, vision, combined, the, traditionalist, right, wing, criticisms, of, the, french, revolution, with, a, left, wing, belief, in, the, need, for, association, or, collaboration, of, productive, people, in, society, whereas, marxism, condemned, capitalism, as, a, system, of, exploitative, property, relations, fascism, saw, the, nature, of, the, control, of, credit, and, money, in, the, contemporary, capitalist, system, as, abusive, unlike, marxism, fascism, did, not, see, class, conflict, between, the, marxist, defined, proletariat, and, the, bourgeoisie, as, a, given, or, as, an, engine, of, historical, materialism, instead, it, viewed, workers, and, productive, capitalists, in, common, as, productive, people, who, were, in, conflict, with, parasitic, elements, in, society, including, corrupt, political, parties, corrupt, financial, capital, and, feeble, people, fascist, leaders, such, as, mussolini, and, hitler, spoke, of, the, need, to, create, a, new, managerial, elite, led, by, engineers, and, captains, of, industry, but, free, from, the, parasitic, leadership, of, industries, hitler, stated, that, the, nazi, party, supported, bodenst, ndigen, kapitalismus, productive, capitalism, that, was, based, upon, profit, earned, from, one, s, own, labour, but, condemned, unproductive, capitalism, or, loan, capitalism, which, derived, profit, from, speculation, fascist, economics, supported, a, state, controlled, economy, that, accepted, a, mix, of, private, and, public, ownership, over, the, means, of, production, economic, planning, was, applied, to, both, the, public, and, private, sector, and, the, prosperity, of, private, enterprise, depended, on, its, acceptance, of, synchronizing, itself, with, the, economic, goals, of, the, state, fascist, economic, ideology, supported, the, profit, motive, but, emphasized, that, industries, must, uphold, the, national, interest, as, superior, to, private, profit, while, fascism, accepted, the, importance, of, material, wealth, and, power, it, condemned, materialism, which, identified, as, being, present, in, both, communism, and, capitalism, and, criticized, materialism, for, lacking, acknowledgement, of, the, role, of, the, spirit, in, particular, fascists, criticized, capitalism, not, because, of, its, competitive, nature, nor, support, of, private, property, which, fascists, supported, but, due, to, its, materialism, individualism, alleged, bourgeois, decadence, and, alleged, indifference, to, the, nation, fascism, denounced, marxism, for, its, advocacy, of, materialist, internationalist, class, identity, which, fascists, regarded, as, an, attack, upon, the, emotional, and, spiritual, bonds, of, the, nation, and, a, threat, to, the, achievement, of, genuine, national, solidarity, in, discussing, the, spread, of, fascism, beyond, italy, historian, philip, morgan, states, since, the, depression, was, a, crisis, of, laissez, faire, capitalism, and, its, political, counterpart, parliamentary, democracy, fascism, could, pose, as, the, third, way, alternative, between, capitalism, and, bolshevism, the, model, of, a, new, european, civilization, as, mussolini, typically, put, it, in, early, 1934, from, 1929, fascism, has, become, a, universal, phenomenon, the, dominant, forces, of, the, 19th, century, democracy, socialism, liberalism, have, been, exhausted, the, new, political, and, economic, forms, of, the, twentieth, century, are, fascist, fascists, criticized, egalitarianism, as, preserving, the, weak, and, they, instead, promoted, social, darwinist, views, and, policies, they, were, in, principle, opposed, to, the, idea, of, social, welfare, arguing, that, it, encouraged, the, preservation, of, the, degenerate, and, the, feeble, the, nazi, party, condemned, the, welfare, system, of, the, weimar, republic, as, well, as, private, charity, and, philanthropy, for, supporting, people, whom, they, regarded, as, racially, inferior, and, weak, and, who, should, have, been, weeded, out, in, the, process, of, natural, selection, nevertheless, faced, with, the, mass, unemployment, and, poverty, of, the, great, depression, the, nazis, found, it, necessary, to, set, up, charitable, institutions, to, help, racially, pure, germans, in, order, to, maintain, popular, support, while, arguing, that, this, represented, racial, self, help, and, not, indiscriminate, charity, or, universal, social, welfare, thus, nazi, programs, such, as, the, winter, relief, of, the, german, people, and, the, broader, national, socialist, people, s, welfare, nsv, were, organized, as, quasi, private, institutions, officially, relying, on, private, donations, from, germans, to, help, others, of, their, race, although, in, practice, those, who, refused, to, donate, could, face, severe, consequences, unlike, the, social, welfare, institutions, of, the, weimar, republic, and, the, christian, charities, the, nsv, distributed, assistance, on, explicitly, racial, grounds, it, provided, support, only, to, those, who, were, racially, sound, capable, of, and, willing, to, work, politically, reliable, and, willing, and, able, to, reproduce, non, aryans, were, excluded, as, well, as, the, work, shy, asocials, and, the, hereditarily, ill, under, these, conditions, by, 1939, over, 17, million, germans, had, obtained, assistance, from, the, nsv, and, the, agency, projected, a, powerful, image, of, caring, and, support, for, those, who, were, judged, to, have, got, into, difficulties, through, no, fault, of, their, own, yet, the, organization, was, feared, and, disliked, among, society, s, poorest, because, it, resorted, to, intrusive, questioning, and, monitoring, to, judge, who, was, worthy, of, support, fascism, emphasizes, direct, action, including, supporting, the, legitimacy, of, political, violence, as, a, core, part, of, its, politics, fascism, views, violent, action, as, a, necessity, in, politics, that, fascism, identifies, as, being, an, endless, struggle, this, emphasis, on, the, use, of, political, violence, means, that, most, fascist, parties, have, also, created, their, own, private, militias, e, g, the, nazi, party, s, brown, shirts, and, fascist, italy, s, blackshirts, the, basis, of, fascism, s, support, of, violent, action, in, politics, is, connected, to, social, darwinism, fascist, movements, have, commonly, held, social, darwinist, views, of, nations, races, and, societies, they, say, that, nations, and, races, must, purge, themselves, of, socially, and, biologically, weak, or, degenerate, people, while, simultaneously, promoting, the, creation, of, strong, people, in, order, to, survive, in, a, world, defined, by, perpetual, national, and, racial, conflict, fascism, emphasizes, youth, both, in, a, physical, sense, of, age, and, in, a, spiritual, sense, as, related, to, virility, and, commitment, to, action, the, italian, fascists, political, anthem, was, called, giovinezza, the, youth, fascism, identifies, the, physical, age, period, of, youth, as, a, critical, time, for, the, moral, development, of, people, who, will, affect, society, walter, laqueur, argues, that, he, corollaries, of, the, cult, of, war, and, physical, danger, were, the, cult, of, brutality, strength, and, sexuality, a, true, counter, civilization, rejecting, the, sophisticated, rationalist, humanism, of, old, europe, fascism, sets, up, as, its, ideal, the, primitive, instincts, and, primal, emotions, of, the, barbarian, italian, fascism, pursued, what, it, called, moral, hygiene, of, youth, particularly, regarding, sexuality, fascist, italy, promoted, what, it, considered, normal, sexual, behaviour, in, youth, while, denouncing, what, it, considered, deviant, sexual, behaviour, it, condemned, pornography, most, forms, of, birth, control, and, contraceptive, devices, with, the, exception, of, the, condom, homosexuality, and, prostitution, as, deviant, sexual, behaviour, although, enforcement, of, laws, opposed, to, such, practices, was, erratic, and, authorities, often, turned, a, blind, eye, fascist, italy, regarded, the, promotion, of, male, sexual, excitation, before, puberty, as, the, cause, of, criminality, amongst, male, youth, declared, homosexuality, a, social, disease, and, pursued, an, aggressive, campaign, to, reduce, prostitution, of, young, women, mussolini, perceived, women, s, primary, role, as, primarily, child, bearers, while, that, of, men, as, warriors, once, saying, war, is, to, man, what, maternity, is, to, the, woman, in, an, effort, to, increase, birthrates, the, italian, fascist, government, gave, financial, incentives, to, women, who, raised, large, families, and, initiated,

unemployment, and, that, for, women, working, was, incompatible, with, childbearing, mussolini, went, on, to, say, that, the, solution, to, unemployment, for, men, was, the, exodus, of, women, from, the, work, force, the, german, nazi, government, strongly, encouraged, women, to, stay, at, home, to, bear, children, and, keep, house, this, policy, was, reinforced, by, bestowing, the, cross, of, honor, of, the, german, mother, on, women, bearing, four, or, more, children, the, unemployment, rate, was, cut, substantially, mostly, through, arms, production, and, sending, women, home, so, that, men, could, take, their, jobs, nazi, propaganda, sometimes, promoted, premarital, and, extramarital, sexual, relations, unwed, motherhood, and, divorce, but, at, other, times, the, nazis, opposed, such, behaviour, the, nazis, decriminalized, abortion, in, cases, where, fetuses, had, hereditary, defects, or, were, of, a, race, the, government, disapproved, of, while, the, abortion, of, healthy, pure, german, aryan, fetuses, remained, strictly, forbidden, for, non, aryans, abortion, was, often, compulsory, their, eugenics, program, also, stemmed, from, the, progressive, biomedical, model, of, weimar, germany, in, 1935, nazi, germany, expanded, the, legality, of, abortion, by, amending, its, eugenics, law, to, promote, abortion, for, women, with, hereditary, disorders, the, law, allowed, abortion, if, a, woman, gave, her, permission, and, the, fetus, was, not, yet, viable, and, for, purposes, of, so, called, racial, hygiene, the, nazis, said, that, homosexuality, was, degenerate, effeminate, perverted, and, undermined, masculinity, because, it, did, not, produce, children, they, considered, homosexuality, curable, through, therapy, citing, modern, scientism, and, the, study,

technology, and, its, association, with, speed, power, and, violence, fascism, admired, advances, in, the, economy, in, the, early, 20th, century, particularly, fordism, and, scientific, management, fascist, modernism, has, been, recognized, as, inspired, or, developed, by, various, figures, such, as, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, ernst, j, nger, gottfried, benn, louis, ferdinand, c, line, knut, hamsun, ezra, pound, and, wyndham, lewis, in, italy, such, modernist, influence, was, exemplified, by, marinetti, who, advocated, a, palingenetic, modernist, society, that, condemned, liberal, bourgeois, values, of, tradition, and, psychology, while, promoting, a, technological, martial, religion, of, national, renewal, that, emphasized, militant, nationalism, in, germany, it, was, exemplified, by, j, nger, who, was, influenced, by, his, observation, of, the, technological, warfare, during, world, war, i, and, claimed, that, a, new, social, class, had, been, created, that, he, described, as, the, warrior, worker, like, marinetti, j, nger, emphasized, the, revolutionary, capacities, of, technology, he, emphasized, an, organic, construction, between, human, and, machine, as, a, liberating, and, regenerative, force, that, challenged, liberal, democracy, conceptions, of, individual, autonomy, bourgeois, nihilism, and, decadence, he, conceived, of, a, society, based, on, a, totalitarian, concept, of, total, mobilization, of, such, disciplined, warrior, workers, in, the, work, of, art, in, the, age, of, mechanical, reproduction, 1935, walter, benjamin, identifies, aestheticization, of, politics, as, a, key, ingredient, in, fascist, regimes, on, this, point, he, quotes, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, founder, of, the, futurist, art, movement, and, co, author, of, the, fascist, manifesto, 1919, who, aestheticizes, war, in, his, writings, and, claims, that, war, is, beautiful, in, simulacra, and, simulation, 1981, jean, baudrillard, interprets, fascism, as, a, political, aesthetic, of, death, and, a, vehement, countermovement, against, the, increasing, rationalism, secularism, and, pacifism, of, the, modern, western, world, the, standard, definition, of, fascism, given, by, stanley, g, payne, focuses, on, three, concepts, one, of, which, is, a, fascist, style, with, an, aesthetic, structure, of, meetings, symbols, and, political, liturgy, stressing, emotional, and, mystical, aspects, emilio, gentile, argues, that, fascism, expresses, itself, aesthetically, more, than, theoretically, by, means, of, a, new, political, style, with, myths, rites, and, symbols, as, a, lay, religion, designed, to, acculturate, socialize, and, integrate, the, faith, of, the, masses, with, the, goal, of, creating, a, new, man, cultural, critic, susan, sontag,

commonalities, between, fascist, art, and, the, official, art, of, communist, countries, such, as, the, obeisance, of, the, masses, to, the, hero, and, a, preference, for, the, monumental, and, the, grandiose, and, rigid, choreography, of, mass, bodies, but, whereas, official, communist, art, aims, to, expound, and, reinforce, a, utopian, morality, the, art, of, fascist, countries, such, as, nazi, germany, displays, a, utopian, aesthetics, that, of, physical, perfection, in, a, way, that, is, both, prurient, and, idealizing, according, to, sontag, fascist, aesthetics, is, based, on, the, containment, of, vital, forces, movements, are, confined, held, tight, held, in, its, appeal, is, not, necessarily, limited, to, those, who, share, the, fascist, political, ideology, because, fascism, stands, for, an, ideal, or, rather, ideals, that, are, persistent, today, under, the, other, banners, the, ideal, of, life, as, art, the, cult, of, beauty, the, fetishism, of, courage, the,

germany, have, led, to, an, almost, universal, condemnation, of, both, past, and, present, forms, of, fascism, in, the, modern, era, fascism, is, today, used, across, the, political, spectrum, as, a, pejorative, or, byword, for, perceived, authoritarianism, and, other, forms, of, political, evil, one, of, the, most, common, and, strongest, criticisms, of, fascism, is, that, it, is, a, tyranny, fascism, is, deliberately, and, entirely, non, democratic, and, anti, democratic, some, critics, of, italian, fascism, have, said, that, much, of, the, ideology, was, merely, a, by, product, of, unprincipled, opportunism, by, mussolini, and, that, he, changed, his, political, stances, merely, to, bolster, his, personal, ambitions, while, he, disguised, them, as, being, purposeful, to, the, public, richard, washburn, child, the, american, ambassador, to, italy, who, worked, with, mussolini, and, became, his, friend, and, admirer, defended, mussolini, s, opportunistic, behaviour, by, writing, opportunist, is, a, term, of, reproach, used, to, brand, men, who, fit, themselves, to, conditions, for, the, reasons, of, self, interest, mussolini, as, i, have, learned, to, know, him, is, an, opportunist, in, the, sense, that, he, believed, that, mankind, itself, must, be, fitted, to, changing, conditions, rather, than, to, fixed, theories, no, matter, how, many, hopes, and, prayers, have, been, expended, on, theories, and, programmes, child, quoted, mussolini, as, saying, the, sanctity, of, an, ism, is, not, in, the, ism, it, has, no, sanctity, beyond, its, power, to, do, to, work, to, succeed, in, practice, it, may, have, succeeded, yesterday, and, fail, to, morrow, failed, yesterday, and, succeed, to, morrow, the, machine, first, of, all, must, run, some, have, criticized, mussolini, s, actions, during, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, as, opportunistic, for, seeming, to, suddenly, abandon, marxist, egalitarian, internationalism, for, non, egalitarian, nationalism, and, note, to, that, effect, that, upon, mussolini, endorsing, italy, s, intervention, in, the, war, against, germany, and, austria, hungary, he, and, the, new, fascist, movement, received, financial, support, from, italian, and, foreign, sources, such, as, ansaldo, an, armaments, firm, and, other, companies, as, well, as, the, british, security, service, mi5, some, including, mussolini, s, socialist, opponents, at, the, time, have, noted, that, regardless, of, the, financial, support, he, accepted, for, his, pro, interventionist, stance, mussolini, was, free, to, write, whatever, he, wished, in, his, newspaper, il, popolo, d, italia, without, prior, sanctioning, from, his, financial, backers, furthermore, the, major, source, of, financial, support, that, mussolini, and, the, fascist, movement, received, in, world, war, i, was, from, france, and, is, widely, believed, to, have, been, french, socialists, who, supported, the, french, government, s, war, against, germany, and, who, sent, support, to, italian, socialists, who, wanted, italian, intervention, on, france, s, side, mussolini, s, transformation, away, from, marxism, into, what, eventually, became, fascism, began, prior, to, world, war, i, as, mussolini, had, grown, increasingly, pessimistic, about, marxism, and, egalitarianism, while, becoming, increasingly, supportive, of, figures, who, opposed, egalitarianism, such, as, friedrich, nietzsche, by, 1902, mussolini, was, studying, georges, sorel, nietzsche, and, vilfredo, pareto, sorel, s, emphasis, on, the, need, for, overthrowing, decadent, liberal, democracy, and, capitalism, by, the, use, of, violence, direct, action, general, strikes, and, neo, machiavellian, appeals, to, emotion, impressed, mussolini, deeply, mussolini, s, use, of, nietzsche, made, him, a, highly, unorthodox, socialist, due, to, nietzsche, s, promotion, of, elitism, and, anti, egalitarian, views, prior, to, world, war, i, mussolini, s, writings, over, time, indicated, that, he, had, abandoned, the, marxism, and, egalitarianism, that, he, had, previously, supported, in, favour, of, nietzsche, s, bermensch, concept, and, anti, egalitarianism, in, 1908, mussolini, wrote, a, short, essay, called, philosophy, of, strength, based, on, his, nietzschean, influence, in, which, mussolini, openly, spoke, fondly, of, the, ramifications, of, an, impending, war, in, europe, in, challenging, both, religion, and, nihilism, new, kind, of, free, spirit, will, come, strengthened, by, the, war, a, spirit, equipped, with, a, kind, of, sublime, perversity, a, new, free, spirit, will, triumph, over, god, and, over, nothing, fascism, has, been, criticized, for, being, ideologically, dishonest, major, examples, of, ideological, dishonesty, have, been, identified, in, italian, fascism, s, changing, relationship, with, german, nazism, fascist, italy, s, official, foreign, policy, positions, commonly, used, rhetorical, ideological, hyperbole, to, justify, its, actions, although, during, dino, grandi, s, tenure, as, italy, s, foreign, minister, the, country, engaged, in, realpolitik, free, of, such, fascist, hyperbole, italian, fascism, s, stance, towards, german, nazism, fluctuated, from, support, from, the, late, 1920s, to, 1934, when, it, celebrated, hitler, s, rise, to, power, and, mussolini, s, first, meeting, with, hitler, in, 1934, to, opposition, from, 1934, to, 1936, after, the, assassination, of, italy, s, allied, leader, in, austria, engelbert, dollfuss, by, austrian, nazis, and, again, back, to, support, after, 1936, when, germany, was, the, only, significant, power, that, did, not, denounce, italy, s, invasion, and, occupation, of, ethiopia, after, antagonism, exploded, between, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, over, the, assassination, of, austrian, chancellor, dollfuss, in, 1934, mussolini, and, italian, fascists, denounced, and, ridiculed, nazism, s, racial, theories, particularly, by, denouncing, its, nordicism, while, promoting, mediterraneanism, mussolini, himself, responded, to, nordicists, claims, of, italy, being, divided, into, nordic, and, mediterranean, racial, areas, due, to, germanic, invasions, of, northern, italy, by, claiming, that, while, germanic, tribes, such, as, the, lombards, took, control, of, italy, after, the, fall, of, ancient, rome, they, arrived, in, small, numbers, about, 8, 000, and, quickly, assimilated, into, roman, culture, and, spoke, the, latin, language, within, fifty, years, italian, fascism, was, influenced, by, the, tradition, of, italian, nationalists, scornfully, looking, down, upon, nordicists, claims, and, taking, pride, in, comparing, the, age, and, sophistication, of, ancient, roman, civilization, as, well, as, the, classical, revival, in, the, renaissance, to, that, of, nordic, societies, that, italian, nationalists, described, as, newcomers, to, civilization, in, comparison, at, the, height, of, antagonism, between, the, nazis, and, italian, fascists, over, race, mussolini, claimed, that, the, germans, themselves, were, not, a, pure, race, and, noted, with, irony, that, the, nazi, theory, of, german, racial, superiority, was, based, on, the, theories, of, non, german, foreigners, such, as, frenchman, arthur, de, gobineau, after, the, tension, in, german, italian, relations, diminished, during, the, late, 1930s, italian, fascism, sought, to, harmonize, its, ideology, with, german, nazism, and, combined, nordicist, and, mediterranean, racial, theories, noting, that, italians, were, members, of, the, aryan, race, composed, of, a, mixed, nordic, mediterranean, subtype, in, 1938, mussolini, declared, upon, italy, s, adoption, of, antisemitic, laws, that, italian, fascism, had, always, been, antisemitic, in, fact, italian, fascism, did, not, endorse, antisemitism, until, the, late, 1930s, when, mussolini, feared, alienating, antisemitic, nazi, germany, whose, power, and, influence, were, growing, in, europe, prior, to, that, period, there, had, been, notable, jewish, italians, who, had, been, senior, italian, fascist, officials, including, margherita, sarfatti, who, had, also, been, mussolini, s, mistress, also, contrary, to, mussolini, s, claim, in, 1938, only, a, small, number, of, italian, fascists, were, staunchly, antisemitic, such, as, roberto, farinacci, and, giuseppe, preziosi, while, others, such, as, italo, balbo, who, came, from, ferrara, which, had, one, of, italy, s, largest, jewish, communities, were, disgusted, by, the, antisemitic, laws, and, opposed, them, fascism, scholar, mark, neocleous, notes, that, while, italian, fascism, did, not, have, a, clear, commitment, to, antisemitism, there, were, occasional, antisemitic, statements, issued, prior, to, 1938, such, as, mussolini, in, 1919, declaring, that, the, jewish, bankers, in, london, and, new, york, were, connected, by, race, to, the, russian, bolsheviks, and, that, eight, percent, of, the, russian, bolsheviks, were, jews, final, solution
