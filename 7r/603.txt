nichols, has, characterized, the, documentary, in, terms, of, a, filmmaking, practice, a, cinematic, tradition, and, mode, of, audience, reception, a, practice, without, clear, boundaries, early, documentary, films, originally, called, actuality, films, briefly, lasted, for, one, minute, or, less, over, time, documentaries, have, evolved, to, become, longer, in, length, and, to, include, more, categories, some, examples, are, educational, observational, and, docufiction, documentaries, are, very, informative, and, are, often, used, within, schools, as, a, resource, to, teach, various, principles, documentary, filmmakers, have, a, responsibility, to, be, truthful, to, their, vision, of, the, world, without, intentionally, misrepresenting, a, topic, social, media, platforms, such, as, youtube, have, provided, an, avenue, for, the, growth, of, the, documentary, film, genre, these, platforms, have, increased, the, distribution, area, and, ease, of, accessibility, polish, writer, and, filmmaker, boles, aw, matuszewski, was, among, those, who, identified, the, mode, of, documentary, film, he, wrote, two, of, the, earliest, texts, on, cinema, une, nouvelle, source, de, l, histoire, a, new, source, of, history, and, la, photographie, anim, e, animated, photography, both, were, published, in, 1898, in, french, and, were, among, the, earliest, written, works, to, consider, the, historical, and, documentary, value, of, the, film, matuszewski, is, also, among, the, first, filmmakers, to, propose, the, creation, of, a, film, archive, to, collect, and, keep, safe, visual, materials, the, word, documentary, was, coined, by, scottish, documentary, filmmaker, john, grierson, in, his, review, of, robert, flaherty, s, film, moana, 1926, published, in, the, new, york, sun, on, 8, february, 1926, written, by, the, moviegoer, a, pen, name, for, grierson, grierson, s, principles, of, documentary, were, that, cinema, s, potential, for, observing, life, could, be, exploited, in, a, new, art, form, that, the, original, actor, and, original, scene, are, better, guides, than, their, fiction, counterparts, for, interpreting, the, modern, world, and, that, materials, thus, taken, from, the, raw, can, be, more, real, than, the, acted, article, in, this, regard, grierson, s, definition, of, documentary, as, creative, treatment, of, actuality, has, gained, some, acceptance, however, this, position, is, at, variance, with, soviet, film, maker, dziga, vertov, s, credos, of, provocation, to, present, life, as, it, is, that, is, life, filmed, surreptitiously, and, life, caught, unawares, life, provoked, or, surprised, by, the, camera, the, american, film, critic, pare, lorentz, defines, a, documentary, film, as, a, factual, film, which, is, dramatic, others, further, state, that, a, documentary, stands, out, from, the, other, types, of, non, fiction, films, for, providing, an, opinion, and, a, specific, message, along, with, the, facts, it, presents, scholar, betsy, mclane, asserted, that, documentaries, are, for, filmmakers, to, convey, their, views, about, historical, events, people, and, places, which, they, find, significant, therefore, the, advantage, of, documentaries, lies, in, introducing, new, perspectives, which, may, not, be, prevalent, in, traditional, media, such, as, written, publications, and, school, curricula, documentary, practice, is, the, complex, process, of, creating, documentary, projects, it, refers, to, what, people, do, with, media, devices, content, form, and, production, strategies, to, address, the, creative, ethical, and, conceptual, problems, and, choices, that, arise, as, they, make, documentaries, documentary, filmmaking, can, be, used, as, a, form, of, journalism, advocacy, or, personal, expression, early, film, pre, 1900, was, dominated, by, the, novelty, of, showing, an, event, single, shot, moments, were, captured, on, film, such, as, a, train, entering, a, station, a, boat, docking, or, factory, workers, leaving, work, these, short, films, were, called, actuality, films, the, term, documentary, was, not, coined, until, 1926, many, of, the, first, films, such, as, those, made, by, auguste, and, louis, lumi, re, were, a, minute, or, less, in, length, due, to, technological, limitations, examples, can, be, viewed, on, youtube, films,

walter, ruttmann, s, berlin, symphony, of, a, metropolis, of, which, grierson, noted, in, an, article, that, berlin, represented, what, a, documentary, should, not, be, alberto, cavalcanti, s, rien,

vertov, was, central, to, the, soviet, kino, pravda, literally, cinematic, truth, newsreel, series, of, the, 1920s, vertov, believed, the, camera, with, its, varied, lenses, shot, counter, shot,

usually, arrive, on, site, after, a, major, battle, and, re, enact, scenes, to, film, them, the, propagandist, tradition, consists, of, films, made, with, the, explicit, purpose, of, persuading, an, audience, of, a, point, one, of, the, most, celebrated, and, controversial, propaganda, films, is, leni, riefenstahl, s, film, triumph, of, the, will, 1935, which, chronicled, the, 1934, nazi, party,

legitimate, counter, propaganda, to, the, psychological, warfare, of, nazi, germany, orchestrated, by, joseph, goebbels, in, britain, a, number, of, different, filmmakers, came, together, under, john, grierson, they, became, known, as, the, documentary, film, movement, grierson, alberto, cavalcanti, harry, watt, basil, wright, and, humphrey, jennings, amongst, others, succeeded, in, blending,

dependent, on, some, technical, advances, to, exist, light, quiet, and, reliable, cameras, and, portable, sync, sound, cin, ma, v, rit, and, similar, documentary, traditions, can, thus, be, seen, in, a, broader, perspective, as, a, reaction, against, studio, based, film, production, constraints, shooting, on, location, with, smaller, crews, would, also, happen, in, the, french, new, wave, the, filmmakers, taking, advantage, of, advances, in, technology, allowing, smaller, handheld, cameras, and, synchronized, sound, to, film, events, on, location, as, they, unfolded, although, the, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, there, are, important, differences, between, cin, ma, v, rit, jean, rouch, and, the, north, american, direct, cinema, or, more, accurately, cin, ma, direct,

no, overt, involvement, and, perrault, rouch, koenig, and, kroitor, favor, direct, involvement, or, even, provocation, when, they, deem, it, necessary, the, films, chronicle, of, a, summer, jean,

by, robert, drew, harlan, county, usa, directed, by, barbara, kopple, lonely, boy, wolf, koenig, and, roman, kroitor, are, all, frequently, deemed, cin, ma, v, rit, films, the, fundamentals, of, the, style, include, following, a, person, during, a, crisis, with, a, moving, often, handheld, camera, to, capture, more, personal, reactions, there, are, no, sit, down, interviews, and, the, shooting, ratio, the, amount, of, film, shot, to, the, finished, product, is, very, high, often, reaching, 80, to, one, from, there, editors, find, and, sculpt, the, work, into, a, film, the, editors, of, the, movement, such, as, werner, nold, charlotte, zwerin, muffie, meyer, susan, froemke, and, ellen, hovde, are, often, overlooked, but, their, input, to, the, films, was, so, vital, that, they, were, often, given, co, director, credits, famous, cin, ma, v, rit, direct, cinema, films, include, les, raquetteurs, showman, salesman, near, death, and, the, children, were, watching, in, the, 1960s, and,

la, hora, de, los, hornos, the, hour, of, the, furnaces, from, 1968, directed, by, octavio, getino, and, fernando, solanas, influenced, a, whole, generation, of, filmmakers, among, the, many,

in, politics, but, more, specifically, on, women, of, color, their, communities, and, the, significant, changes, they, have, wrought, upon, america, box, office, analysts, have, noted, that, the, documentary, film, genre, has, become, increasingly, successful, in, theatrical, release, with, films, such, as, fahrenheit, 9, 11, super, size, me, food, inc, earth, march, of, the, penguins, and, an, inconvenient, truth, among, the, most, prominent, examples, compared, to, dramatic, narrative, films, documentaries, typically, have, far, lower, budgets, which, makes, them, attractive, to, film, companies, because, even, a, limited, theatrical, release, can, be, highly, profitable, the, nature, of, documentary, films, has, expanded, in, the, past, 30, years, from, the, cin, ma, v, rit, style, introduced, in, the, 1960s, in, which, the, use, of, portable, camera, and, sound, equipment, allowed, an, intimate, relationship, between, filmmaker, and, subject, the, line, blurs, between, documentary, and, narrative, and, some, works, are, very, personal, such, as, marlon, riggs, s, tongues, untied, 1989, and, black, is, black, ain, t, 1995, which, mix, expressive, poetic, and, rhetorical, elements, and, stresses, subjectivities, rather, than, historical, materials, historical, documentaries, such, as, the, landmark, 14, hour, eyes, on, the, prize, america, s, civil, rights, years, 1986, part, 1, and, 1989, part, 2, by, henry, hampton, 4, little, girls, 1997, by, spike, lee, the, civil, war, by, ken, burns, and, unesco, awarded, independent, film, on, slavery, 500, years, later, express, not, only, a, distinctive, voice, but, also, a, perspective, and, point, of, views, some, films, such, as, the, thin, blue, line, by, errol, morris, incorporate, stylized, re, enactments, and, michael, moore, s, roger, me, place, far, more, interpretive, control, with, the, director, the, commercial, success, of, these, documentaries, may, derive, from, this, narrative, shift, in, the, documentary, form, leading, some, critics, to, question, whether, such, films, can, truly, be, called, documentaries, critics, sometimes, refer, to, these, works, as, mondo, films, or, docu, ganda, however, directorial, manipulation, of, documentary, subjects, has, been, noted, since, the, work, of, flaherty, and, may, be, endemic, to, the, form, due, to, problematic, ontological, foundations, documentary, filmmakers, are, increasingly, using, social, impact, campaigns, with, their, films, social, impact, campaigns, seek, to, leverage, media, projects, by, converting, public, awareness, of, social, issues, and, causes, into, engagement, and, action, largely, by, offering, the, audience, a, way, to, get, involved, examples, of, such, documentaries, include, kony, 2012, salam, neighbor, gasland, living, on, one, dollar, and, girl, rising, although, documentaries, are, financially, more, viable, with, the, increasing, popularity, of, the, genre, and, the, advent, of, the, dvd, funding, for, documentary, film, production, remains, elusive, within, the, past, decade, the, largest, exhibition, opportunities, have, emerged, from, within, the, broadcast, market, making, filmmakers, beholden, to, the, tastes, and, influences, of, the, broadcasters, who, have, become, their, largest, funding, source, modern, documentaries, have, some, overlap, with, television, forms, with, the, development, of, reality, television, that, occasionally, verges, on, the, documentary, but, more, often, veers, to, the, fictional, or, staged, the, making, of, documentary, shows, how, a, movie, or, a, computer, game, was, produced, usually, made, for, promotional, purposes, it, is, closer, to, an, advertisement, than, a, classic, documentary, modern, lightweight, digital, video, cameras, and, computer, based, editing, have, greatly, aided, documentary, makers, as, has, the, dramatic, drop, in, equipment, prices, the, first, film, to, take, full, advantage, of, this, change, was, martin, kunert, and, eric, manes, voices, of, iraq, where, 150, dv, cameras, were, sent, to, iraq, during, the, war, and, passed, out, to, iraqis, to, record, themselves, films, in, the,

is, to, have, a, dedicated, narrator, read, a, script, which, is, dubbed, onto, the, audio, track, the, narrator, never, appears, on, camera, and, may, not, necessarily, have, knowledge, of, the, subject, matter, or, involvement, in, the, writing, of, the, script, this, style, of, narration, uses, title, screens, to, visually, narrate, the, documentary, the, screens, are, held, for, about, 5, 10, seconds, to, allow, adequate, time, for, the, viewer, to, read, them, they, are, similar, to, the, ones, shown, at, the, end, of, movies, based, on, true, stories, but, they, are, shown,

documentaries, do, not, see, themselves, as, a, transparent, window, on, the, world, instead, they, draw, attention, to, their, own, constructedness, and, the, fact, that, they, are, representations, how, does, the, world, get, represented, by, documentary, films, this, question, is, central, to, this, subgenre, of, films, they, prompt, us, to, question, the, authenticity, of, documentary, in, general, it, is, the, most, self, conscious, of, all, the, modes, and, is, highly, skeptical, of, realism, it, may, use, brechtian, alienation, strategies, to, jar, us, in, order, to, defamiliarize, what, we, are, seeing, and, how, we, are, seeing, it, performative, documentaries, stress, subjective, experience, and, emotional, response, to, the, world, they, are, strongly, personal, unconventional, perhaps, poetic, and, or, experimental, and, might, include, hypothetical, enactments, of, events, designed, to, make, us, experience, what, it, might, be, like, for, us, to, possess, a, certain, specific, perspective, on, the, world, that, is, not, our, own, e, g, that, of, black, gay, men, in, marlon, riggs, s, tongues, untied, 1989, or, jenny, livingston, s, paris, is, burning, 1991, this, subgenre, might, also, lend, itself, to, certain, groups, e, g, women, ethnic, minorities, gays, and, lesbians, etc, to, speak, about, themselves, often, a, battery, of, techniques, many, borrowed, from, fiction, or, avant, garde, films, are, used, performative, docs, often, link, up, personal, accounts, or, experiences, with, larger, political, or, historical, realities, documentaries, are, shown, in, schools, around, the, world, in, order, to, educate, students, used, to, introduce, various, topics, to, children, they, are, often, used, with, a, school, lesson, or, shown, many, times, to, reinforce, an, idea, there, are, several, challenges, associated, with, translation, of, documentaries, the, main, two, are, working, conditions, and, problems, with, terminology, documentary, translators, very, often, have, to, meet, tight, deadlines, normally, the, translator, has, between, five, and, seven, days, to, hand, over, the, translation, of, a, 90, minute, programme, dubbing, studios, typically, give, translators, a, week, to, translate, a, documentary, but, in, order, to, earn, a, good, salary, translators, have, to, deliver, their, translations, in, a, much, shorter, period, usually, when, the, studio, decides, to, deliver, the, final, programme, to, the, client, sooner, or, when, the, broadcasting, channel, sets, a, tight, deadline, e, g, on, documentaries, discussing, the, latest, news, another, problem, is, the, lack, of, postproduction, script, or, the, poor, quality, of, the, transcription, a, correct, transcription, is, essential, for, a, translator, to, do, their, work, properly, however, many, times, the, script, is, not, even, given, to, the, translator, which, is, a, major, impediment, since, documentaries, are, characterised, by, the, abundance, of, terminological, units, and, very, specific, proper, names, when, the, script, is, given, to, the, translator, it, is, usually, poorly, transcribed, or, outright, incorrect, making, the, translation, unnecessarily, difficult, and, demanding, because, all, of, the, proper, names, and, specific, terminology, have, to, be, correct, in, a, documentary, programme, in, order, for, it, to, be, a, reliable, source, of, information, hence, the, translator, has, to, check, every, term, on, their, own, such, mistakes, in, proper, names, are, for, instance, jungle, reinhard, instead, of, django, reinhart, jorn, asten, instead, of, jane, austen, and, magnus, axle, instead, of, aldous, huxley, the, process, of, translation, of, a, documentary, programme, requires, working, with, very, specific, often, scientific, terminology, documentary, translators, are, not, usually, specialists, in, a, given, field, therefore, they, are, compelled, to, undertake, extensive, research, whenever, asked, to, make, a, translation, of, a, specific, documentary, programme, in, order, to, understand, it, correctly, and, deliver, the, final, product, free, of, mistakes, and, inaccuracies, generally, documentaries, contain, a, large, number, of, specific, terms, with, which, translators, have, to, familiarise, themselves, on, their, own, for, example, the, documentary, beetles, record, breakers, makes, use, of, 15, different, terms, to, refer, to, beetles, in, less, than, 30, minutes, longhorn, beetle, cellar, beetle, stag, beetle, burying, beetle, or, gravediggers, sexton, beetle, tiger, beetle, bloody, nose, beetle, tortoise, beetle, diving, beetle, devil, s, coach, horse, weevil, click, beetle, malachite, beetle, oil, beetle, cockchafer, apart, from, mentioning, other, animals, such, as, horseshoe, bats, or, meadow, brown, butterflies, this, poses, a, real, challenge, for, the, translators, because, they, have, to, render, the, meaning, i, e, find, an, equivalent, of, a, very, specific, scientific, term, in, the, target, language, and, frequently, the, narrator, uses, a, more, general, name, instead, of, a, specific, term, and, the, translator, has, to, rely, on, the, image, presented, in, the, programme, to, understand, which, term, is, being, discussed, in, order, to, transpose, it, in, the, target, language, accordingly, additionally, translators, of, minorised, languages, often, have, to, face, another, problem, some, terms, may, not, even, exist, in, the, target, language, in, such, cases, they, have, to, create, new, terminology, or, consult, specialists, to, find, proper, solutions, also, sometimes, the, official, nomenclature, differs, from, the, terminology, used, by, actual, specialists, which, leaves, the, translator, to, decide, between, using, the, official, vocabulary, that, can, be, found, in, the, dictionary, or, rather, opting, for, spontaneous, expressions, used, by, real, experts, in, real, life, situations
