genocide, denial, is, the, attempt, to, deny, or, minimize, the, scale, and, severity, of, an, instance, of, genocide, denial, is, an, integral, part, of, genocide, and, includes, the, secret, planning, of, genocide, propaganda, while, the, genocide, is, going, on, and, destruction, of, evidence, of, mass, killings, according, to, genocide, researcher, gregory, stanton, denial, is, among, the, surest, indicators, of, further, genocidal, massacres, some, scholars, define, denial, as, the, final, stage, of, a, genocidal, process, richard, g, hovannisian, states, complete, annihilation, of, a, people, requires, the, banishment, of, recollection, and, suffocation, of, remembrance, falsification, deception, and, half, truths, reduce, what, was, to, what, might, have, been, or, perhaps,

genocide, denial, and, rwandan, genocide, denial, the, distinction, between, respectable, academic, historians, and, illegitimate, historical, negationists, and, revisionists, including, genocide, deniers, rests, upon, the, techniques, which, are, used, in, the, writing, of, such, histories, historical, revisionists, and, negationists, rewrite, history, in, order, to, support, an, agenda, which, is, usually, political, or, ideological, by, using, falsification, and, rhetorical, fallacies, in, order, to, obtain, their, desired, results, exposure, of, genocide, denial, and, revisionism, surged, in, the, early, 21st, century, facilitated, by, the, propagation, of, conspiracy, theories, and, hate, speech, on, social, media, according, to, taner, ak, am, the, practice, of, denialism, in, regard, to, mass, atrocities, is, usually, thought, of, as, a, simple, denial, of, the, facts, but, this, is, not, true, rather, it, is, in, that, nebulous, territory, between, facts, and, truth, where, such, denialism, germinates, david, tolbert, president, of, the, international, center, for, transitional, justice, states, denial, is, the, final, fortress, of, those, who, commit, genocide, and, other, mass, crimes, perpetrators, hide, the, truth, to, avoid, accountability, and, protect, the, political, and, economic, advantages, they, sought, to, gain, by, mass, killings, and, theft, of, the, victims, property, and, to, cement, the, new, reality, by, manufacturing, an, alternative, history, recent, studies, have, established, that, such, denial, not, only, damages, the, victims, and, their, destroyed, communities, it, promises, a, future, based, on, lies, sowing, the, seeds, of, future, conflict, repression, and, suffering, some, of, the, main, reasons, for, denying, genocide, are, to, evade, moral, or, even, criminal, responsibility, and, to, protect, the, perpetrators, reputation, gregory, stanton, outlines, the, tactics, of, genocide, denial, including, questioning, the, statistics, denial, of, intent, definitional, debates, and, blaming, the, victims, genocide, scholar, israel, charny, outlines, five, psychological, characteristics, of, denials, of, genocide, genocide, scholar, adam, jones, proposed, a, framework, for, genocide, denial, that, consists, of, several, strategies, including, minimizing, fatalities, blaming, fatalities, on, unrelated, natural, causes, denying, intent, to, destroy, a, group, and, claiming, self, defense, in, preemptive, or, disproportionate, attacks, the, australian, government, has, been, criticized, for, engaging, in, genocide, denial, and, historic, revisionism, concerning, the, treatment, of, indigenous, people, prominent, australian, politicians, have, refused, to, acknowledge, the, genocide, the, government, of, canada, has, been, criticized, for, engaging, in, denial, of, its, role, in, the, genocide, of, indigenous, people, in, 2022, gregory, stanton, former, president, of, international, association, of, genocide, scholars, issued, a, report, of, canada, s, genocide, saying, it, is, in, denial, in, japan, interpretation, of, the, nanjing, massacre, is, reflected, upon, the, notions, of, pride, honor, and, shame, takashi, yoshida, describes, the, japanese, debate, over, the, nanjing, massacre, as, crystalliz, a, much, larger, conflict, over, what, should, constitute, the, ideal, perception, of, the, nation, japan, as, a, nation, acknowledges, its, past, and, apologizes, for, its, wartime, wrongdoings, or, stands, firm, against, foreign, pressures, and, teaches, japanese, youth, about, the, benevolent, and, courageous, martyrs, who, fought, a, just, war, to, save, asia, from, western, aggression, in, some, nationalist, circles, in, japan, speaking, of, a, large, scale, massacre, at, nanjing, is, regarded, as, japan, bashing, in, the, case, of, foreigners, or, self, flagellation, in, the, case, of, japanese, this, means, that, most, japanese, youth, are, oblivious, of, the, massacre, because, this, dark, history, is, not, taught, in, japanese, schools, and, the, continued, worship, of, japanese, war, criminals, enshrined, in, the, yasukuni, shrine, by, mainstream, politicians, in, japan, the, government, of, pakistan, continues, to, deny, that, any, bangladeshi, genocide, took, place, during, the, bangladesh, liberation, war, of, 1971, they, typically, accuse, pakistani, reporters, such, as, anthony, mascarenhas, who, reported, on, the, genocide, of, being, enemy, agents, according, to, donald, w, beachler, professor, of, political, science, at, ithaca, college, the, government, of, pakistan, explicitly, denied, that, there, was, genocide, by, their, refusal, to, characterise, the, mass, killings, as, genocide, or, to, condemn, and, restrain, the, pakistani, government, the, us, and, chinese, governments, implied, that, they, did, not, consider, it, so, similarly, in, the, wake, of, the, 2013, shahbag, protests, against, war, criminals, who, were, complicit, in, the, genocide, english, journalist, philip, hensher, wrote, the, genocide, is, still, too, little, known, about, in, the, west, it, is, moreover, the, subject, of, shocking, degrees, of, denial, among, partisan, polemicists, and, manipulative, historians, according, to, sonja, biserko, president, of, the, helsinki, committee, for, human, rights, in, serbia, and, edina, becirevic, the, faculty, of, criminology, and, security, studies, of, the, university, of, sarajevo, denial, of, the, srebrenica, genocide, takes, many, forms, the, methods, range, from, the, brutal, to, the, deceitful, denial, is, present, most, strongly, in, political, discourse, in, the, media, in, the, sphere, of, law, and, in, the, educational, system, the, government, of, the, republic, of, turkey, has, long, denied, that, the, armenian, genocide, was, a, genocide, according, to, ak, am, turkish, denialism, is, perhaps, the, most, successful, example, of, how, the, well, organised, deliberate, and, systematic, spreading, of, falsehoods, can, play, an, important, role, in, the, field, of, public, debate, and, that, fact, based, truths, have, been, discredited, and, relegated, to, the, status, of, mere, opinion, turkey, acknowledges, that, many, armenians, residing, in, the, ottoman, empire, were, killed, in, conflicts, with, ottoman, forces, during, world, war, one, but, disputes, the, statistics, and, claims, that, the, killings, were, systematic, and, amounted, to, genocide, measures, recognising, the, armenian, genocide, have, languished, in, the, us, congress, for, decades, and, us, presidents, have, refrained, from, labelling, it, such, due, to, worries, about, relations, with, turkey, and, intensive, lobbying, by, ankara, the, government, of, the, united, states, has, been, accused, of, denial, of, the, genocide, of, its, indigenous, peoples, by, academics, such, as, benjamin, madley, david, stannard, and, noam, chomsky, the, european, commission, proposed, a, european, union, wide, anti, racism, law, in, 2001, which, included, an, offence, of, genocide, denial, but, european, union, states, failed, to, agree, on, the, balance, between, prohibiting, racism, and, freedom, of, expression, after, six, years, of, debating, a, watered, down, compromise, was, reached, in, 2007, which, gave, eu, states, freedom, to, implement, the, legislation, as, they, saw, fit, in, 2022, the, united, nations, office, on, genocide, prevention, and, the, responsibility, to, protect, issued, a, policy, paper, associating, genocide, denial, with, hate, speech, specifically, when, directed, to, specific, identifiable, groups, the, report, gives, policy, recommendations, for, states, and, un, officials, in, the, matter, of, denial, genocide, denial, has, an, impact, on, both, victim, and, perpetrator, groups, denial, of, a, genocide, affects, relations, between, the, victim, and, perpetrator, groups, or, their, respective, countries, prevents, personal, victims, of, the, genocide, from, seeking, closure, and, adversely, affects, political, decisions, on, both, sides, it, can, cause, fear, in, the, victims, to, express, their, cultural, identity, retaliation, from, both, parties, and, hamper, the, democratic, development, of, societies, effects, on, personal, victims, of, the, genocide, while, confrontation, of, the, committed, atrocities, can, be, a, tough, process, in, which, the, victim, feels, humiliated, again, by, reliving, the, traumatic, past, it, still, has, a, benign, therapeutic, effect, helping, both, victim, and, perpetrator, groups, to, come, to, terms, with, the, past, from, a, therapeutic, point, of, view, letting, the, victim, confront, the, past, atrocity, and, its, related, painful, memories, is, one, way, to, reach, a, closure, and, to, understand, that, the, harm, has, occurred, in, the, past, this, also, helps, the, memories, to, enter, the, shared, narrative, of, the, society, thereby, becoming, a, common, ground, on, which, the, society, can, make, future, decisions, on, in, political, and, cultural, matters, denying, recognition, in, contrast, has, a, negative, effect, further, victimising, the, victim, which, will, feel, not, only, wronged, by, the, perpetrator, but, also, by, being, denied, recognition, of, the, occurred, wrongdoing, denial, also, has, a, pivotal, role, in, shaping, the, norms, of, a, society, since, the, omission, of, any, committed, errors, and, thereby, the, lack, of, condemnation, and, punishment, of, the, committed, wrongs, risks, normalising, similar, actions, increasing, the, society, s, tolerance, for, future, occurrences, of, similar, errors, according, to, sociologist, daniel, feierstein, the, genocide, perpetrator, implements, a, process, of, transforming, the, identity, of, any, survivors, and, erasing, the, memory, of, the, existence, of, the, victim, group, societal, effects, of, genocide, denial, bhargava, notes, that, ost, calls, to, forget, disguise, the, attempt, to, prevent, victims, from, publicly, remembering, in, the, fear, that, there, is, a, dragon, living, on, the, patio, and, we, better, not, provoke, it, in, other, words, while, societally, forgetting, an, atrocity, can, on, the, surface, be, beneficial, to, the, harmony, of, society, it, further, victimizes, the, target, group, for, fear, of, future, similar, action, and, is, directly, detrimental, to, the, sociocultural, development, of, the, victim, group, on, the, other, hand, there, are, cases, where, forgetting, atrocities, is, the, most, politically, expedient, or, stable, option, this, is, found, in, some, states, which, have, recently, come, out, of, minority, rule, where, the, perpetrator, group, still, controls, most, strategic, resources, and, institutions, such, as, south, africa, this, was, among, others, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, granting, amnesty, in, exchange, for, confessing, to, committed, errors, during, the, transitional, period, in, south, africa, however, the, society, at, large, and, the, victims, in, particular, will, perceive, this, kind, of, trade, offs, as, morally, suspect, and, may, question, its, sustainability, thus, a, common, refrain, in, regard, to, the, final, report, 1998, by, south, africa, s, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, was, we, ve, heard, the, truth, there, is, even, talk, about, reconciliation, but, where, s, the, justice, effects, on, democratic, development, the, denial, has, thereby, a, direct, negative, impact, on, the, development, of, a, society, often, by, undermining, its, laws, and, the, issue, of, justice, but, also, the, level, of, democracy, itself, if, democracy, is, meant, to, be, built, on, the, rule, of, law, and, justice, upheld, and, safeguarded, by, state, institutions, then, surely, the, omission, of, legal, consequences, and, justice, would, potentially, undermine, the, democracy, what, is, more, dangerous, from, a, historical, point, of, view, is, that, such, a, default, would, imply, the, subsequent, loss, of, the, meaning, of, these, events, to, future, generations, a, loss, which, is, resembled, to, losing, a, moral, compass, the, society, becomes, susceptible, to, similar, wrongdoings, in, the, absence, of, proper, handling, of, preceding, occasions, nonetheless, denial, especially, immediately, after, the, committed, wrongdoings, is, rather, the, rule, than, the, exception, and, naturally, almost, exclusively, done, by, the, perpetrator, to, escape, responsibility, implicit, denial, of, genocide, while, some, societies, or, governments, openly, deny, genocide, in, some, other, cases, e, g, in, the, case, of, the, comfort, women, and, the, role, of, the, japanese, state, the, denial, is, more, implicit, this, was, evident, in, how, an, overwhelmingly, majority, of, the, surviving, victims, refused, to, accept, a, monetary, compensation, since, the, japanese, government, still, refused, to, admit, its, own, responsibility, the, monetary, compensation, was, paid, through, a, private, fund, rather, than, by, the, state, a, decision, perceived, by, the, victims, about, state, s, refusal, to, assume, any, direct, responsibility, this, can, have, the, same, effects, on, societies, as, outright, denial, for, example, atrocity, denial, and, self, victimisation, in, japanese, historical, textbooks, has, caused, much, diplomatic, tension, between, japan, and, neighbouring, victim, states, such, as, korea, and, china, and, bolstered, domestic, conservative, or, nationalist, forces, turkey, and, armenian, genocide, denial, the, turkish, state, s, armenian, genocide, denial, has, had, far, reaching, effects, on, the, turkish, society, throughout, its, history, in, regard, to, both, ethnic, minorities, especially, the, kurds, but, political, opposition, in, general, the, denial, also, affects, turks, in, that, there, is, a, lack, of, recognition, of, turks, and, ottoman, officials, who, attempted, to, stop, the, genocide, this, lack, of, recognition, of, the, various, actors, at, play, in, turkey, could, result, in, a, rather, homogeneous, perception, of, the, nation, in, question, thus, making, armenians, but, also, third, parties, project, the, perpetrating, role, onto, the, entire, turkish, society, and, nation, causing, further, racial, strife, and, aggravating, the, prospects, of, future, reconciliation, for, example, armenian, terrorist, groups, e, g, asala, and, jcag, committed, terrorist, acts, during, 1970, s, and, 1980, s, as, a, direct, result, of, the, turkish, state, denial, of, the, genocide, denial, may, be, reduced, by, works, of, history, preservation, of, archives, documentation, of, records, investigation, panels, search, for, missing, persons, commemorations, official, state, apologies, development, of, truth, commissions, educational, programs, monuments, and, museums, according, to, johnathan, sisson, the, society, has, the, right, to, know, the, truth, about, historical, events, and, facts, and, the, circumstances, that, led, to, massive, or, systematic, human, rights, violations, he, says, that, the, state, has, the, obligation, to, secure, records, and, other, evidence, to, prevent, revisionist, arguments, genocide, scholar, gregory, stanton, suggests, that,
