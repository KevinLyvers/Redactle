the, oromo, speak, it, as, a, second, language, see, for, example, the, omotic, speaking, bambassi, and, the, nilo, saharan, speaking, kwama, in, northwestern, oromia, the, oromo, people, use, a, highly, developed, oral, tradition, in, the, 19th, century, scholars, began, writing, in, the, oromo, language, using, latin, script, in, 1842, johann, ludwig, krapf, began, translations, of, the,

in, several, languages, including, oromo, and, publishing, and, radio, broadcasts, began, in, the, language, all, oromo, materials, printed, in, ethiopia, at, that, time, such, as, the, newspaper, bariisaa, urjii, and, many, others, were, written, in, the, traditional, ethiopic, script, plans, to, introduce, oromo, language, instruction, in, schools, however, were, not, realized, until, the, government, of, mengistu, haile, mariam, was, overthrown, in, 1991, except, in, regions, controlled, by, the, oromo, liberation, front, olf, with, the, creation, of, the, regional, state, of, oromia, under, the, new, system, of, ethnic, federalism, in, ethiopia, it, has, been, possible, to, introduce, oromo, as, the, medium, of, instruction, in, elementary, schools, throughout, the, region, including, areas, where, other, ethnic, groups, live, speaking, their, languages, and, as, a, language, of, administration, within, the, region, since, the, olf, left, the, transitional, ethiopian, government, in, the, early, 1990s, the, oromo, peoples, democratic, organization, opdo, continued, developing, oromo, in, ethiopia, radio, broadcasts, began, in, the, oromo, language, in, somalia, in, 1960, by, radio, mogadishu, the, programme, featured, music, and, propaganda, a, song, bilisummaan, aannaani, liberation, is, milk, became, a, hit, in, ethiopia, to, combat, somali, wide, reaching, influence, the, ethiopian, government, initiated, an, oromo, language, program, radio, of, their, own, within, kenya, there, has, been, radio, broadcasting, in, oromo, in, the, borana, dialect, on, the, voice, of, kenya, since, at, least, the, 1980s, the, borana, bible, in, kenya, was, printed, in, 1995, using, the, latin, alphabet, but, not, using, the, same, spelling, rules, as, in, ethiopian, qubee, the, first, comprehensive, online, oromo, dictionary, was, developed, by, the, jimma, times, oromiffa, group, jtog, in, cooperation, with, selamsoft, voice, of, america, also, broadcasts, in, oromo, alongside, its, other, horn, of, africa, programs, in, may, 2022, google, translate, added, afaan, oromo, as, translation, oromo, and, qubee, are, currently, utilized, by, the, ethiopian, government, s, state, radios, tv, stations, and, regional, government, newspaper, oromo, is, written, with, a, latin, alphabet, called, qubee, which, was, formally, adopted, in, 1991, various, versions, of, the, latin, based, orthography, had, been, used, previously, mostly, by, oromos, outside, of, ethiopia, and, by, the, olf, by, the, late, 1970s, heine, 1986, with, the, adoption, of, qubee, it, is, believed, more, texts, were, written, in, the, oromo, language, between, 1991, and, 1997, than, in, the, previous, 100, years, in, kenya, the, borana, and, waata, also, use, roman, letters, but, with, different, systems, the, sapalo, script, was, an, indigenous, oromo, script, and, it, was, invented, by, sheikh, bakri, sapalo, 1895, 1980, also, known, by, his, birth, name, abubaker, usman, odaa, in, the, late, 1950s, and, used, underground, afterwards, despite, structural, and, organizational, influences, from, ge, ez, and, the, arabic, script, it, is, a, graphically, independent, creation, designed, specifically, for, oromo, phonology, it, is, largely, an, abugida, in, nature, but, lacks, the, inherent, vowel, present, in, many, such, systems, in, actual, use, all, consonant, characters, are, obligatorily, marked, either, with, vowel, signs, producing, cv, syllables, or, with, separate, marks, used, to, denote, geminated, consonants, or, pure, standalone, consonants, not, followed, by, a, vowel, e, g, in, word, final, environments, or, as, part, of, consonant, clusters, the, arabic, script, has, also, been, used, intermittently, in, areas, with, muslim, populations, like, most, other, ethiopian, languages, whether, semitic, cushitic, or, omotic, oromo, has, a, set, of, ejective, consonants, that, is, voiceless, stops, or, affricates, that, are, accompanied, by, glottalization, and, an, explosive, burst, of, air, oromo, has, another, glottalized, phone, that, is, more, unusual, an, implosive, retroflex, stop, dh, in, oromo, orthography, a, sound, that, is, like, an, english, d, produced, with, the, tongue, curled, back, slightly, and, with, the, air, drawn, in, so, that, a, glottal, stop, is, heard, before, the, following, vowel, begins, it, is, retroflex, in, most, dialects, though, it, is, not, strongly, implosive, and, may, reduce, to, a, flap, between, vowels, one, source, describes, it, as, voiceless, oromo, has, the, typical, eastern, cushitic, set, of, five, short, and, five, long, vowels, indicated, in, the, orthography, by, doubling, the, five, vowel, letters, the, difference, in, length, is, contrastive, for, example, hara, lake, haaraa, new, gemination, is, also, significant, in, oromo, that, is, consonant, length, can, distinguish, words, from, one, another, for, example, badaa, bad, baddaa, highland, in, the, qubee, alphabet, letters, include, the, digraphs, ch, dh, ny, ph, sh, gemination, is, not, obligatorily, marked, for, digraphs, though, some, writers, indicate, it, by, doubling, the, first, element, qopphaa, uu, be, prepared, in, the, charts, below, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, symbol, for, a, phoneme, is, shown, in, brackets, where, it, differs, from, the, oromo, letter, the, phonemes, p, v, z, appear, in, parentheses, because, they, are, only, found, in, recently, adopted, words, there, have, been, minor, changes, in, the, orthography, since, it, was, first, adopted, x, was, originally, rendered, th, and, there, has, been, some, confusion, among, authors, in, the, use, of, c, and, ch, in, representing, the, phonemes, t, and, t, with, some, early, works, using, c, for, t, and, ch, for, t, and, even, c, for, different, phonemes, depending, on, where, it, appears, in, a, word, this, article, uses, c, consistently, for, t, and, ch, for, t, only, the, penultimate, or, final, syllable, of, a, root, can, have, a, high, tone, and, if, the, penultimate, is, high, the, final, must, also, be, high, this, implies, that, oromo, has, a, pitch, accent, system, in, which, the, tone, need, be, specified, only, on, one, syllable, the, others, being, predictable, rather, than, a, tone, system, in, which, each, syllable, must, have, its, tone, specified, although, the, rules, are, complex, each, morpheme, can, contribute, its, own, tone, pattern, to, the, word, so, that, one, can, call, oromo, a, pitch, accent, system, in, terms, of, the, basic, lexical, representation, of, pitch, and, a, tone, system, in, terms, of, its, surface, realization, the, stressed, syllable, is, perceived, as, the, first, syllable, of, a, word, with, high, pitch, like, most, other, afroasiatic, languages, oromo, has, two, grammatical, genders, masculine, and, feminine, and, all, nouns, belong, to, either, one, or, the, other, grammatical, gender, in, oromo, enters, into, the, grammar, in, the, following, ways, except, in, some, southern, dialects, there, is, nothing, in, the, form, of, most, nouns, that, indicates, their, gender, a, small, number, of, nouns, pairs, for, people, however, end, in, eessa, m, and, eettii, f, as, do, adjectives, when, they, are, used, as, nouns, obboleessa, brother, obboleettii, sister, dureessa, the, rich, one, m, hiyyeettii, the, poor, one, f, grammatical, gender, normally, agrees, with, natural, gender, for, people, and, animals, thus, nouns, such, as, abbaa, father, ilma, son, and, sangaa, ox, are, masculine, while, nouns, such, as, haadha, mother, and, intala, girl, daughter, are, feminine, however, most, names, for, animals, do, not, specify, biological, gender, names, of, astronomical, bodies, are, feminine, aduu, sun, urjii, star, the, gender, of, other, inanimate, nouns, varies, somewhat, among, dialects, oromo, displays, singular, and, plural, number, but, nouns, that, refer, to, multiple, entities, are, not, obligatorily, plural, nama, man, namoota, people, nama, shan, five, men, namoota, shan, five, people, another, way, of, looking, at, this, is, to, treat, the, singular, form, as, unspecified, for, number, when, it, is, important, to, make, the, plurality, of, a, referent, clear, the, plural, form, of, a, noun, is, used, noun, plurals, are, formed, through, the, addition, of, suffixes, the, most, common, plural, suffix, is, oota, a, final, vowel, is, dropped, before, the, suffix, and, in, the, western, dialects, the, suffix, becomes, ota, following, a, syllable, with, a, long, vowel, mana, house, manoota, houses, hiriyaa, friend, hiriyoota, friends, barsiisaa, teacher, barsiiso, o, ta, teachers, among, the, other, common, plural, suffixes, are, w, wan, een, and, a, an, the, latter, two, may, cause, a, preceding, consonant, to, be, doubled, waggaa, year, waggaawwan, years, laga, river, laggeen, rivers, ilma, son, ilmaan, sons, oromo, has, no, indefinite, articles, corresponding, to, english, a, some, but, except, in, the, southern, dialects, it, indicates, definiteness, english, the, with, suffixes, on, the, noun, t, icha, for, masculine, nouns, the, ch, is, geminated, though, this, is, not, normally, indicated, in, writing, and, t, ittii, for, feminine, nouns, vowel, endings, of, nouns, are, dropped, before, these, suffixes, karaa, road, karicha, the, road, nama, man, namicha, namticha, the, man, haroo, lake, harittii, the, lake, for, animate, nouns, that, can, take, either, gender, the, definite, suffix, may, indicate, the, intended, gender, qaalluu, priest, qaallicha, the, priest, m, qallittii, the, priest, f, the, definite, suffixes, appear, to, be, used, less, often, than, the, in, english, and, they, seem, not, to, co, occur, with, the, plural, suffixes, oromo, nouns, appear, in, seven, grammatical, cases, each, indicated, by, a, suffix, the, lengthening, of, the, noun, s, final, vowel, or, both, for, some, of, the, cases, there, is, a, range, of, forms, possible, some, covering, more, than, one, case, and, the, differences, in, meaning, among, these, alternatives, may, be, quite, subtle, in, most, languages, there, is, a, small, number, of, basic, distinctions, of, person, number, and, often, gender, that, play, a, role, within, the, grammar, of, the, language, oromo, and, english, are, such, languages, we, see, these, distinctions, within, the, basic, set, of, independent, personal, pronouns, for, example, english, i, oromo, ani, english, they, oromo, isaani, and, the, set, of, possessive, adjectives, and, pronouns, for, example, english, my, oromo, koo, english, mine, oromo, kan, koo, in, oromo, the, same, distinctions, are, also, reflected, in, subject, verb, agreement, oromo, verbs, with, a, few, exceptions, agree, with, their, subjects, that, is, the, person, number, and, singular, third, person, gender, of, the, subject, of, the, verb, are, marked, by, suffixes, on, the, verb, because, these, suffixes, vary, greatly, with, the, particular, verb, tense, aspect, mood, they, are, normally, not, considered, to, be, pronouns, and, are, discussed, elsewhere, in, this, article, under, verb, conjugation, in, all, of, these, areas, of, the, grammar, independent, pronouns, possessive, adjectives, possessive, pronouns, and, subject, verb, agreement, oromo, distinguishes, seven, combinations, of, person, number, and, gender, for, first, and, second, persons, there, is, a, two, way, distinction, between, singular, i, you, sg, and, plural, we, you, pl, whereas, for, third, person, there, is, a, two, way, distinction, in, the, singular, he, she, and, a, single, form, for, the, plural, they, because, oromo, has, only, two, genders, there, is, no, pronoun, corresponding, to, english, it, the, masculine, or, feminine, pronoun, is, used, according, to, the, gender, of, the, noun, referred, to, oromo, is, a, subject, pro, drop, language, that, is, neutral, sentences, in, which, the, subject, is, not, emphasized, do, not, require, independent, subject, pronouns, kaleessa, dhufne, we, came, yesterday, the, oromo, word, that, translates, we, does, not, appear, in, this, sentence, though, the, person, and, number, are, marked, on, the, verb, dhufne, we, came, by, the, suffix, ne, when, the, subject, in, such, sentences, needs, to, be, given, prominence, for, some, reason, an, independent, pronoun, can, be, used, nuti, kaleessa, dhufne, we, came, yesterday, the, table, below, gives, forms, of, the, personal, pronouns, in, the, different, cases, as, well, as, the, possessive, adjectives, for, the, first, person, plural, and, third, person, singular, feminine, categories, there, is, considerable, variation, across, dialects, only, some, of, the, possibilities, are, shown, the, possessive, adjectives, treated, as, separate, words, here, are, sometimes, written, as, noun, suffixes, in, most, dialects, there, is, a, distinction, between, masculine, and, feminine, possessive, adjectives, for, first, and, second, person, the, form, agreeing, with, the, gender, of, the, modified, noun, however, in, the, western, dialects, the, masculine, forms, those, beginning, with, k, are, used, in, all, cases, possessive, adjectives, may, take, the, case, endings, for, the, nouns, they, modify, ganda, kootti, to, my, village, tti, locative, case, as, in, languages, such, as, french, russian, and, turkish, the, oromo, second, person, plural, is, also, used, as, a, polite, singular, form, for, reference, to, people, that, the, speaker, wishes, to, show, respect, towards, this, usage, is, an, example, of, the, so, called, t, v, distinction, that, is, made, in, many, languages, in, addition, the, third, person, plural, may, be, used, for, polite, reference, to, a, single, third, person, either, he, or, she, for, possessive, pronouns, mine, yours, etc, oromo, adds, the, possessive, adjectives, to, kan, of, kan, koo, mine, kan, kee, yours, etc, oromo, has, two, ways, of, expressing, reflexive, pronouns, myself, yourself, etc, one, is, to, use, the, noun, meaning, self, of, i, or, if, i, this, noun, is, inflected, for, case, but, unless, it, is, being, emphasized, not, for, person, number, or, gender, isheen, of, laalti, she, looks, at, herself, base, form, of, of, isheen, ofiif, makiinaa, bitte, she, bought, herself, a, car, dative, of, of, the, other, possibility, is, to, use, the, noun, meaning, head, mataa, with, possessive, suffixes, mataa, koo, myself, mataa, kee, yourself, s, etc, oromo, has, a, reciprocal, pronoun, wal, english, each, other, that, is, used, like, of, if, that, is, it, is, inflected, for, case, but, not, person, number, or, gender, wal, jaalatu, they, like, each, other, base, form, of, wal, kennaa, walii, bitan, they, bought, each, other, gifts, dative, of, wal, like, english, oromo, makes, a, two, way, distinction, between, proximal, this, these, and, distal, that, those, demonstrative, pronouns, and, adjectives, some, dialects, distinguish, masculine, and, feminine, for, the, proximal, pronouns, in, the, western, dialects, the, masculine, forms, beginning, with, k, are, used, for, both, genders, unlike, in, english, singular, and, plural, demonstratives, are, not, distinguished, but, as, for, nouns, and, personal, pronouns, in, the, language, case, is, distinguished, only, the, base, and, nominative, forms, are, shown, in, the, table, below, the, other, cases, are, formed, from, the, base, form, as, for, nouns, for, example, sanatti, at, on, in, that, locative, case, an, oromo, verb, consists, minimally, of, a, stem, representing, the, lexical, meaning, of, the, verb, and, a, suffix, representing, tense, or, aspect, and, subject, agreement, for, example, in, dhufne, we, came, dhuf, is, the, stem, come, and, ne, indicates, that, the, tense, is, past, and, that, the, subject, of, the, verb, is, first, person, plural, as, in, many, other, afroasiatic, languages, oromo, makes, a, basic, two, way, distinction, in, its, verb, system, between, the, two, tensed, forms, past, or, perfect, and, present, or, imperfect, or, non, past, each, of, these, has, its, own, set, of, tense, agreement, suffixes, there, is, a, third, conjugation, based, on, the, present, which, has, three, functions, it, is, used, in, place, of, the, present, in, subordinate, clauses, for, the, jussive, let, me, us, him, etc, v, together, with, the, particle, haa, and, for, the, negative, of, the, present, together, with, the, particle, hin, for, example, deemne, we, went, deemna, we, go, akka, deemnu, that, we, go, haa, deemnu, let, s, go, hin, deemnu, we, don, t, go, there, is, also, a, separate, imperative, form, deemi, go, sg, the, table, below, shows, the, conjugation, in, the, affirmative, and, negative, of, the, verb, beek, know, the, first, person, singular, present, and, past, affirmative, forms, require, the, suffix, n, to, appear, on, the, word, preceding, the, verb, or, the, word, nan, before, the, verb, the, negative, particle, hin, shown, as, a, separate, word, in, the, table, is, sometimes, written, as, a, prefix, on, the, verb, for, verbs, with, stems, ending, in, certain, consonants, and, suffixes, beginning, with, consonants, that, is, t, or, n, there, are, predictable, changes, to, one, or, the, other, of, the, consonants, the, dialects, vary, a, lot, in, the, details, but, the, following, changes, are, common, verbs, whose, stems, end, in, two, consonants, and, whose, suffix, begins, with, a, consonant, must, insert, a, vowel, to, break, up, the, consonants, since, the, language, does, not, permit, sequences, of, three, consonants, there, are, two, ways, this, can, happen, either, the, vowel, i, is, inserted, between, the, stem, and, the, suffix, or, the, final, stem, consonants, are, switched, an, example, of, metathesis, and, the, vowel, a, is, inserted, between, them, for, example, arg, see, arga, he, sees, argina, or, agarra, from, agar, na, we, see, kolf, laugh, kolfe, he, laughed, kolfite, or, kofalte, you, sg, laughed, verbs, whose, stems, end, in, the, consonant, which, may, appear, as, h, w, or, y, in, some, words, depending, on, the, dialect, belong, to, three, different, conjugation, classes, the, class, is, not, predictable, from, the, verb, stem, it, is, the, forms, that, precede, suffixes, beginning, with, consonants, t, and, n, that, differ, from, the, usual, pattern, the, third, person, masculine, singular, second, person, singular, and, first, person, plural, present, forms, are, shown, for, an, example, verb, in, each, class, the, common, verbs, fedh, want, and, godh, do, deviate, from, the, basic, conjugation, pattern, in, that, long, vowels, replace, the, geminated, consonants, that, would, result, when, suffixes, beginning, with, t, or, n, are, added, fedha, he, wants, feeta, you, sg, want, feena, we, want, feetu, you, pl, want, hin, feene, didn, t, want, etc, the, verb, dhuf, come, has, the, irregular, imperatives, koottu, koottaa, the, verb, deem, go, has, alongside, regular, imperative, forms, the, irregular, imperatives, deemi, deemaa, an, oromo, verb, root, can, be, the, basis, for, three, derived, voices, passive, causative, and, autobenefactive, each, formed, with, addition, of, a, suffix, to, the, root, yielding, the, stem, that, the, inflectional, suffixes, are, added, to, the, voice, suffixes, can, be, combined, in, various, ways, two, causative, suffixes, are, possible, ka, go, up, kaas, pick, up, kaasis, cause, to, pick, up, the, causative, may, be, followed, by, the, passive, or, the, autobenefactive, in, this, case, the, s, of, the, causative, is, replaced, by, f, deebi, return, intransitive, deebis, return, transitive, answer, deebifam, be, returned, be, answered, deebifadh, get, back, for, oneself, another, derived, verbal, aspect, is, the, frequentative, or, intensive, formed, by, copying, the, first, consonant, and, vowel, of, the, verb, root, and, geminating, the, second, occurrence, of, the, initial, consonant, the, resulting, stem, indicates, the, repetition, or, intensive, performance, of, the, action, of, the, verb, examples, bul, spend, the, night, bubbul, spend, several, nights, cab, break, caccab, break, to, pieces, break, completely, dhiib, push, apply, pressure, dhiddhiib, massage, the, infinitive, is, formed, from, a, verb, stem, with, the, addition, of, the, suffix, uu, verbs, whose, stems, end, in, dh, in, particular, all, autobenefactive, verbs, change, this, to, ch, before, the, suffix,
