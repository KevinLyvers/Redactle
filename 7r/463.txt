do, some, people, of, malagasy, descent, elsewhere, malagasy, is, divided, across, its, twelve, dialects, between, two, main, dialect, groups, eastern, and, western, the, central, plateau, of, the,

fourth, republic, of, madagascar, malagasy, is, written, in, the, latin, script, introduced, by, western, missionaries, in, the, early, 19th, century, previously, the, sorabe, script, was, used, a, local, development, of, the, arabic, script, the, malagasy, language, is, the, westernmost, member, of, the, malayo, polynesian, branch, of, the, austronesian, language, family, a, grouping, that, includes, languages, from, indonesia, malaysia, the, philippines, and, the, pacific, islands, in, fact, malagasy, s, relation, with, other, austronesian, languages, had, already, been, noted, by, early, scholars, such, as, the, dutch, scholar, adriaan, reland, in, 1708, among, all, austronesian, languages, dahl, 1951, demonstrated, that, malagasy, and, ma, anyan, an, east, barito, language, spoken, in, central, kalimantan, indonesia, on, the, island, of, borneo, were, particularly, closely, related, the, language, also, has, apparent, influence, from, early, old, malay, furthermore, there, appears, to, be, a, bantu, influence, or, substratum, in, malagasy, phonotactics, dahl, 1988, there, are, some, sanskrit, loanwords, in, malagasy, which, are, said, to, have, been, borrowed, via, malay, and, javanese, adelaar, 1995, suggested, that, the, vocabulary, of, malagasy, also, contains, many, words, that, are, of, south, sulawesi, origin, further, evidence, for, this, suggestion, was, presented, by, blench, 2018, malagasy, is, the, demonym, of, madagascar, from, which, it, is, taken, to, refer, to, the, people, of, madagascar, in, addition, to, their, language, madagascar, was, first, settled, by, austronesian, peoples, from, maritime, southeast, asia, from, the, sunda, islands, malay, archipelago, as, for, their, route, one, possibility, is, that, the, indonesian, austronesian, came, directly, across, the, indian, ocean, from, java, to, madagascar, it, is, likely, that, they, went, through, the, maldives, where, evidence, of, old, indonesian, boat, design, and, fishing, technology, persists, until, the, present, the, migrations, continued, along, the, first, millennium, as, confirmed, by, linguistic, researchers, who, showed, the, close, relationship, between, the, malagasy, language, and, old, malay, and, old, javanese, languages, of, this, period, the, malagasy, language, originates, from, the, southeast, barito, languages, and, the, ma, anyan, language, is, its, closest, relative, with, numerous, malay, and, javanese, loanwords, it, is, known, that, ma, anyan, people, were, brought, as, labourers, and, slaves, by, malay, and, javanese, people, in, their, trading, fleets, which, reached, madagascar, by, c, 50, 500, ad, later, c, 1000, the, original, austronesian, settlers, mixed, with, bantus, and, arabs, amongst, others, there, is, evidence, that, the, predecessors, of, the, malagasy, dialects, first, arrived, in, the, southern, stretch, of, the, east, coast, of, madagascar, adelaar, 2017, proposes, that, a, distinct, malagasy, speech, community, had, already, been, established, in, south, borneo, before, the, early, malagasy, speakers, migrated, to, east, africa, malagasy, has, a, tradition, of, oratory, arts, and, poetic, histories, and, legends, the, most, well, known, is, the, national, epic, ibonia, about, a, malagasy, folk, hero, of, the, same, name, malagasy, is, the, principal, language, spoken, on, the, island, of, madagascar, it, is, also, spoken, by, malagasy, communities, on, neighboring, indian, ocean, islands, such, as, r, union, mayotte, and, mauritius, expatriate, malagasy, communities, speaking, the, language, also, exist, in, europe, and, north, america, the, merina, dialect, of, malagasy, is, considered, the, national, language, of, madagascar, it, is, one, of, two, official, languages, alongside, french, in, the, 2010, constitution, put, in, place, the, fourth, republic, previously, under, the, 2007, constitution, malagasy, was, one, of, three, official, languages, alongside, french, and, english, malagasy, is, the, language, of, instruction, in, all, public, schools, through, grade, five, for, all, subjects, and, remains, the, language, of, instruction, through, high, school, for, the, subjects, of, history, and, malagasy, language, there, are, two, principal, dialects, of, malagasy, eastern, including, merina, and, western, including, sakalava, with, the, isogloss, running, down, the, spine, of, the, island, the, south, being, western, and, the, central, plateau, and, much, of, the, north, apart, from, the, very, tip, being, eastern, ethnologue, encodes, 12, variants, of, malagasy, as, distinct, languages, they, have, about, a, 70, similarity, in, lexicon, with, the, merina, dialect, the, eastern, dialects, are, the, western, dialects, are, additionally, the, bushi, dialect, 41, 700, speakers, is, spoken, on, the, french, overseas, territory, of, mayotte, which, is, part, of, the, comoro, island, chain, situated, northwest, of, madagascar, the, two, main, dialects, of, malagasy, are, easily, distinguished, by, several, phonological, features, sakalava, lost, final, nasal, consonants, whereas, merina, added, a, voiceless, final, t, became, in, the, one, but, in, the, other, sakalava, retains, ancestral, li, and, ti, whereas, in, merina, these, become, as, in, huditra, skin, above, and, however, these, last, changes, started, in, borneo, before, the, malagasy, arrived, in, madagascar, the, language, has, a, written, literature, going, back, presumably, to, the, 15th, century, when, the, french, established, fort, dauphin, in, the, 17th, century, they, found, an, arabico, malagasy, script, in, use, known, as, sorabe, large, writings, this, arabic, derived, sorabe, alphabet, was, mainly, used, for, astrological, and, magical, texts, the, oldest, known, manuscript, in, that, script, is, a, short, malagasy, dutch, vocabulary, from, the, early, 17th, century, which, was, first, published, in, 1908, by, gabriel, ferrand, though, the, script, must, have, been, introduced, into, the, southeast, area, of, madagascar, in, the, 15th, century, the, first, bilingual, renderings, of, religious, texts, are, those, by, tienne, de, flacourt, who, also, published, the, first, dictionary, of, the, language, radama, i, the, first, literate, representative, of, the, merina, monarchy, though, extensively, versed, in, the, arabico, malagasy, tradition, opted, in, 1823, for, a, latin, system, derived, by, david, jones, and, invited, the, protestant, london, missionary, society, to, establish, schools, and, churches, the, first, book, to, be, printed, in, malagasy, using, latin, characters, was, the, bible, which, was, translated, into, malagasy, in, 1835, by, british, protestant, missionaries, working, in, the, highlands, area, of, madagascar, the, current, malagasy, alphabet, consists, of, 21, letters, a, b, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, v, y, z, the, orthography, maps, rather, straightforwardly, to, the, phonemic, inventory, the, letters, i, and, y, both, represent, the, i, sound, y, is, used, word, finally, and, i, elsewhere, while, o, is, pronounced, u, the, affricates, and, are, written, tr, and, dr, respectively, while, ts, and, dz, are, written, ts, and, j, the, letter, h, is, often, silent, all, other, letters, have, essentially, their, ipa, values, the, letters, c, q, u, w, and, x, are, all, not, used, in, native, malagasy, words, mp, and, occasionally, nt, may, begin, a, word, but, they, are, pronounced, p, t, is, used, informally, as, a, short, form, for, amin, ny, which, is, a, preposition, followed, by, the, definite, form, meaning, for, instance, with, the, diacritics, are, not, obligatory, in, standard, malagasy, except, in, the, case, where, its, absence, leads, to, an, ambiguity, tan, na, city, must, have, the, diacritic, to, discriminate, itself, from, tanana, hand, they, may, however, be, used, in, the, following, ways, after, a, stressed, syllable, as, at, the, end, of, most, words, and, in, the, final, two, syllables, of, some, a, u, i, are, reduced, to, i, is, spelled, y, in, such, cases, though, in, monosyllabic, words, like, ny, and, vy, y, is, pronounced, as, a, full, final, a, and, sometimes, final, syllables, are, devoiced, at, the, end, of, an, utterance, e, and, o, are, never, reduced, or, devoiced, the, large, number, of, reduced, vowels, and, their, effect, on, neighbouring, consonants, give, malagasy, a, phonological, quality, not, unlike, that, of, portuguese, o, is, marginal, in, merina, dialect, found, in, interjections, and, loan, words, though, it, is, also, found, in, place, names, from, other, dialectical, areas, ai, au, are, diphthongs, in, careful, speech, or, in, more, casual, speech, ai, whichever, way, it, is, pronounced, affects, following, k, as, i, does, the, alveolars, s, ts, z, dz, l, are, slightly, palatalized, ts, dz, s, z, vary, between, and, and, are, especially, likely, to, be, the, latter, when, followed, by, unstressed, i, thus, french, malgache, malagasy, the, velars, k, k, h, are, palatalized, after, i, e, g, alika, alik, a, dog, h, is, frequently, elided, in, casual, speech, the, reported, postalveolar, trilled, affricates, are, sometimes, simple, stops, but, they, often, have, a, rhotic, release, it, is, not, clear, if, they, are, actually, trilled, or, are, simply, non, sibilant, affricates, however, in, another, austronesian, language, with, a, claimed, trilled, affricate, fijian, trilling, occurs, but, is, rare, and, the, primary, distinguishing, feature, is, that, it, is, postalveolar, the, malagasy, sounds, are, frequently, transcribed, and, that, is, the, convention, used, in, this, article, in, reduplication, compounding, possessive, and, verbal, constructions, as, well, as, after, nasals, fricatives, and, liquids, spirants, become, stops, as, follows, here, stressed, syllables, are, indicated, by, grave, diacritics, although, these, diacritics, are, normally, not, used, words, are, generally, accented, on, the, penultimate, syllable, unless, the, word, ends, in, ka, tra, and, often, na, in, which, case, they, are, stressed, on, the, antepenultimate, syllable, secondary, stresses, exist, in, even, numbered, syllables, from, the, last, stressed, syllable, when, the, word, has, more, than, four, syllables, f, mant, ran, ndro, watch, clock, neither, prefixation, nor, suffixation, affect, the, placement, of, stress, in, many, dialects, unstressed, vowels, except, e, are, devoiced, and, in, some, cases, almost, completely,
