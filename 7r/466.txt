or, alphasyllabary, called, baybayin, this, system, of, writing, gradually, gave, way, to, the, use, and, propagation, of, the, latin, alphabet, as, introduced, by, the, spanish, as, the, spanish, began, to, record, and, create, grammars, and, dictionaries, for, the, various, languages, of, the, philippine, archipelago, they, adopted, systems, of, writing, closely, following, the, orthographic, customs, of, the, spanish, language, and, were, refined, over, the, years, until, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, most, philippine, languages, were, widely, written, in, a, variety, of, ways, based, on, spanish, orthography, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, number, of, educated, filipinos, began, proposing, for, revising, the, spelling, system, used, for, tagalog, at, the, time, in, 1884, filipino, doctor, and, student, of, languages, trinidad, pardo, de, tavera, published, his, study, on, the, ancient, tagalog, script, contribucion, para, el, estudio, de, los, antiguos, alfabetos, filipinos, and, in, 1887, published, his, essay, el, sanscrito, en, la, lengua, tagalog, which, made, use, of, a, new, writing, system, developed, by, him, meanwhile, jose, rizal, inspired, by, pardo, de, tavera, s, 1884, work, also, began, developing, a, new, system, of, orthography, unaware, at, first, of, pardo, de, tavera, s, own, orthography, a, major, noticeable, change, in, these, proposed, orthographies, was, the, use, of, the, letter, k, rather, than, c, and, q, to, represent, the, phoneme, k, in, 1889, the, new, bilingual, spanish, tagalog, la, espa, a, oriental, newspaper, of, which, isabelo, de, los, reyes, was, an, editor, began, publishing, using, the, new, orthography, stating, in, a, footnote, that, it, would, use, the, orthography, recently, introduced, by, learned, orientalis, this, new, orthography, while, having, its, supporters, was, also, not, initially, accepted, by, several, writers, soon, after, the, first, issue, of, la, espa, a, pascual, h, poblete, s, revista, cat, lica, de, filipina, began, a, series, of, articles, attacking, the, new, orthography, and, its, proponents, a, fellow, writer, pablo, tecson, was, also, critical, among, the, attacks, was, the, use, of, the, letters, k, and, w, as, they, were, deemed, to, be, of, german, origin, and, thus, its, proponents, were, deemed, as, unpatriotic, the, publishers, of, these, two, papers, would, eventually, merge, as, la, lectura, popular, in, january, 1890, and, would, eventually, make, use, of, both, spelling, systems, in, its, articles, pedro, laktaw, a, schoolteacher, published, the, first, spanish, tagalog, dictionary, using, the, new, orthography, in, 1890, in, april, 1890, jose, rizal, authored, an, article, sobre, la, nueva, ortografia, de, la, lengua, tagalog, in, the, madrid, based, periodical, la, solidaridad, in, it, he, addressed, the, criticisms, of, the, new, writing, system, by, writers, like, pobrete, and, tecson, and, the, simplicity, in, his, opinion, of, the, new, orthography, rizal, described, the, orthography, promoted, by, pardo, de, tavera, as, more, perfect, than, what, he, himself, had, developed, the, new, orthography, was, however, not, broadly, adopted, initially, and, was, used, inconsistently, in, the, bilingual, periodicals, of, manila, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, revolutionary, society, kata, s, taasan, kagalang, galang, katipunan, ng, mg, anak, ng, bayan, or, katipunan, made, use, of, the, k, orthography, and, the, letter, k, featured, prominently, on, many, of, its, flags, and, insignias, in, 1937, tagalog, was, selected, to, serve, as, basis, for, the, country, s, national, language, in, 1940, the, balaril, ng, wikang, pambans, english, grammar, of, the, national, language, of, grammarian, lope, k, santos, introduced, the, abakada, alphabet, this, alphabet, consists, of, 20, letters, and, became, the, standard, alphabet, of, the, national, language, the, orthography, as, used, by, tagalog, would, eventually, influence, and, spread, to, the, systems, of, writing, used, by, other, philippine, languages, which, had, been, using, variants, of, the, spanish, based, system, of, writing, in, 1987, the, abakada, was, dropped, and, replaced, by, the, expanded, filipino, alphabet, tagalog, was, written, in, an, abugida, alphasyllabary, called, baybayin, prior, to, the, spanish, colonial, period, in, the, philippines, in, the, 16th, century, this, particular, writing, system, was, composed, of, symbols, representing, three, vowels, and, 14, consonants, belonging, to, the, brahmic, family, of, scripts, it, shares, similarities, with, the, old, kawi, script, of, java, and, is, believed, to, be, descended, from, the, script, used, by, the, bugis, in, sulawesi, although, it, enjoyed, a, relatively, high, level, of, literacy, baybayin, gradually, fell, into, disuse, in, favor, of, the, latin, alphabet, taught, by, the, spaniards, during, their, rule, there, has, been, confusion, of, how, to, use, baybayin, which, is, actually, an, abugida, or, an, alphasyllabary, rather, than, an, alphabet, not, every, letter, in, the, latin, alphabet, is, represented, with, one, of, those, in, the, baybayin, alphasyllabary, rather, than, letters, being, put, together, to, make, sounds, as, in, western, languages, baybayin, uses, symbols, to, represent, syllables, a, kudl, t, resembling, an, apostrophe, is, used, above, or, below, a, symbol, to, change, the, vowel, sound, after, its, consonant, if, the, kudlit, is, used, above, the, vowel, is, an, e, or, i, sound, if, the, kudlit, is, used, below, the, vowel, is, an, o, or, u, sound, a, special, kudlit, was, later, added, by, spanish, missionaries, in, which, a, cross, placed, below, the, symbol, to, get, rid, of, the, vowel, sound, all, together, leaving, a, consonant, previously, the, consonant, without, a, following, vowel, was, simply, left, out, for, example, bund, k, being, rendered, as, budo, forcing, the, reader, to, use, context, when, reading, such, words, example, until, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, tagalog, was, widely, written, in, a, variety, of, ways, based, on, spanish, orthography, consisting, of, 32, letters, called, abecedario, spanish, for, alphabet, the, additional, letters, from, the, 26, letter, english, alphabet, are, ch, ll, ng, n, g, g, and, rr, when, the, national, language, was, based, on, tagalog, grammarian, lope, k, santos, introduced, a, new, alphabet, consisting, of, 20, letters, called, abakada, in, school, grammar, books, called, balaril, the, only, letter, not, in, the, english, alphabet, is, ng, in, 1987, the, department, of, education, culture, and, sports, issued, a, memo, stating, that, the, philippine, alphabet, had, changed, from, the, pilipino, tagalog, abakada, version, to, a, new, 28, letter, alphabet, to, make, room, for, loans, especially, family, names, from, spanish, and, english, the, additional, letters, from, the, 26,

how, something, is, done, or, to, what, extent, equivalent, to, the, suffix, ly, in, english, adverbs, among, other, uses, in, the, first, example, nang, is, used, in, lieu, of, the, word, noong,
