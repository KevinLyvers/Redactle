appeal, appellate, proceeding, is, also, generally, not, deemed, a, trial, because, such, proceedings, are, usually, restricted, to, a, review, of, the, evidence, presented, before, the, trial, court, and, do, not, permit, the, introduction, of, new, evidence, a, criminal, trial, is, designed, to, resolve, accusations, brought, usually, by, a, government, against, a, person, accused, of, a, crime, in, common, law, systems, most, criminal, defendants, are, entitled, to, a, trial, held, before, a, jury, because, the, state, is, attempting, to, use, its, power, to, deprive, the, accused, of, life, liberty, or, property, the, rights, of, the, accused, afforded, to, criminal, defendants, are, typically, broad, the, rules, of, criminal, procedure, provide, rules, for, criminal, trials, a, civil, trial, is, generally, held, to, settle, lawsuits, or, civil, claims, non, criminal, disputes, in, some, countries, the, government, can, both, sue, and, be, sued, in, a, civil, capacity, the, rules, of, civil, procedure, provide, rules, for, civil, trials, although, administrative, hearings, are, not, ordinarily, considered, trials, they, retain, many, elements, found, in, more, formal, trial, settings, when, the, dispute, goes, to, a, judicial, setting, it, is, called, an, administrative, trial, to, revise, the, administrative, hearing, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, the, types, of, disputes, handled, in, these, hearings, are, governed, by, administrative, law, and, auxiliarily, by, civil, trial, law, labor, law, also, known, as, employment, law, is, the, body, of, laws, administrative, rulings, and, precedents, which, address, the, legal, rights, of, and, restrictions, on, working, people, and, their, organizations, collective, labour, law, relates, to, the, tripartite, relationship, between, employee, employer, and, union, individual, labour, law, concerns, employees, rights, at, work, also, through, the, contract, for, work, employment, standards, are, social, norms, in, some, cases, also, technical, standards, for, the, minimum, socially, acceptable, conditions, under, which, employees, or, contractors, are, allowed, to, work, government, agencies, such, as, the, former, us, employment, standards, administration, enforce, labour, law, legislature, regulatory, or, judicial, in, common, law, systems, an, adversarial, or, accusatory, approach, is, used, to, adjudicate, guilt, or, innocence, the, assumption, is, that, the, truth, is, more, likely, to, emerge, from, the, open, contest, between, the, prosecution, and, the, defense, in, presenting, the, evidence, and, opposing, legal, arguments, with, a, judge, acting, as, a, neutral, referee, and, as, the, arbiter, of, the, law, in, several, jurisdictions, in, more, serious, cases, there, is, a, jury, to, determine, the, facts, although, some, common, law, jurisdictions, have, abolished, the, jury, trial, this, polarizes, the, issues, with, each, competitor, acting, in, its, own, self, interest, and, so, presenting, the, facts, and, interpretations, of, the, law, in, a, deliberately, biased, way, the, intention, is, that, through, a, process, of, argument, and, counter, argument, examination, in, chief, and, cross, examination, each, side, will, test, the, truthfulness, relevancy, and, sufficiency, of, the, opponent, s, evidence, and, arguments, to, maintain, fairness, there, is, a, presumption, of, innocence, and, the, burden, of, proof, lies, on, the, prosecution, critics, of, the, system, argue, that, the, desire, to, win, is, more, important, than, the, search, for, truth, further, the, results, are, likely, to, be, affected, by, structural, inequalities, those, defendants, with, resources, can, afford, to, hire, the, best, lawyers, some, trials, are, or, were, of, a, more, summary, nature, as, certain, questions, of, evidence, were, taken, as, resolved, see, handhabend, and, backberend, in, civil, law, legal, systems, the, responsibility, for, supervising, the, investigation, by, the, police, into, whether, a, crime, has, been, committed, falls, on, an, examining, magistrate, or, judge, who, then, conducts, the, trial, the, assumption, is, that, the, truth, is, more, likely, to, emerge, from, an, impartial, and, exhaustive, investigation, both, before, and, during, the, trial, itself, the, examining, magistrate, or, judge, acts, as, an, inquisitor, who, directs, the, fact, gathering, process, by, questioning, witnesses, interrogating, the, suspect, and, collecting, other, evidence, the, lawyers, who, represent, the, interests, of, the, state, and, the, accused, have, a, limited, role, to, offer, legal, arguments, and, alternative, interpretations, to, the, facts, that, emerge, during, the, process, all, the, interested, parties, are, expected, to, cooperate, in, the, investigation, by, answering, the, magistrate, or, judge, s, questions, and, when, asked, supplying, all, relevant, evidence, the, trial, only, takes, place, after, all, the, evidence, has, been, collected, and, the, investigation, is, completed, thus, most, of, the, factual, uncertainties, will, already, be, resolved, and, the, examining, magistrate, or, judge, will, already, have, resolved, that, there, is, prima, facie, of, guilt, critics, argue, that, the, examining, magistrate, or, judge, has, too, much, power, with, the, responsibilities, of, both, investigating, and, adjudicating, on, the, merits, of, the, case, although, lay, assessors, do, sit, as, a, form, of, jury, to, offer, advice, to, the, magistrate, or, judge, at, the, conclusion, of, the, trial, their, role, is, subordinate, further, because, a, professional, has, been, in, charge, of, all, aspects, of, the, case, to, the, conclusion, of, the, trial, there, are, fewer, opportunities, to, appeal, the, conviction, alleging, some, procedural, error, a, judge, may, cancel, a, trial, prior, to, the, return, of, a, verdict, legal, parlance, designates, this, as, a, mistrial, a, judge, may, declare, a, mistrial, due, to, either, side, may, submit, a, motion, for, a, mistrial, on, occasion, the, presiding, judge, may, declare, one, on, a, motion, of, their, own, if, a, mistrial, is, declared, the, case, at, hand, may, be, retried, at, the, discretion, of, the, plaintiff, or, prosecution, as, long, as, double, jeopardy, does, not, bar, that, party, from, doing, so, some, other, kinds, of, processes, for, resolving, conflicts, are, also, expressed, as, trials, for, example, the, united, states, constitution, requires, that, following, the, impeachment, of, the, president, a, judge, or, another, federal, officer, by, the, house, of, representatives, the, subject, of, the, impeachment, may, only, be, removed, from, office, by, an, impeachment, trial, in, the, senate, in, earlier, times, disputes, were, often, settled, through, a, trial, by, ordeal, where, parties, would, have, to, endure, physical, suffering, in, order, to, prove, their, righteousness, or, through, a, trial, by, combat, in, which, the, winner, of, a, physical, fight, was, deemed, righteous, in, their, cause
