different, forms, of, secondary, education, including, general, and, vocational, education, should, be, available, and, accessible, to, every, child, the, terminology, has, proved, difficult, and, there, was, no, universal, definition, before, isced, divided, the, period, between, primary, education, and, university, into, junior, secondary, education, and, upper, secondary, education, in, classical, and, medieval, times, secondary, education, was, provided, by, the, church, for, the, sons, of, nobility, and, to, boys, preparing, for, universities, and, the, priesthood, as, trade, required, navigational, and, scientific, skills, the, church, expanded, the, curriculum, and, widened, the, intake, with, the, reformation, the, state, began, taking, control, of, learning, from, the, church, and, with, comenius, and, john, locke, education, changed, from, being, repetition, of, latin, text, to, building, up, knowledge, in, the, child, education, was, for, the, few, up, to, the,

education, for, all, youth, under, 19, secondary, education, refers, to, the, stage, of, formal, education, that, follows, primary, education, and, precedes, higher, education, it, is, typically, offered, to, students, between, the, ages, of, 12, and, 18, although, the, specific, age, range, may, vary, depending, on, the, educational, system, and, country, the, purpose, of, secondary, education, is, to, provide, students, with, a, well, rounded, education, that, prepares, them, for, higher, education, or, the, workforce, it, aims, to, develop, their, intellectual, social, and, emotional, skills, while, also, fostering, critical, thinking, creativity, and, independence, the, 1997, international, standard, classification, of, education, isced, describes, seven, levels, that, can, be, used, to, compare, education, internationally, within, a, country, these, can, be, implemented, in, different, ways, with, different, age, levels, and, local, denominations, the, seven, levels, are, within, this, system, levels, 1, and, 2, that, is, primary, education, and, lower, secondary, together, form, basic, education, beyond, that, national, governments, may, attach, the, label, of, secondary, education, to, levels, 2, through, 4, together, levels, 2, and, 3, together, or, level, 2, alone, these, level, definitions, were, put, together, for, statistical, purposes, and, to, allow, the, gathering, of, comparative, data, nationally, and, internationally, they, were, approved, by, the, unesco, general, conference, at, its, 29th, session, in, november, 1997, though, they, may, be, dated, they, do, provide, a, universal, set, of, definitions, and, remain, unchanged, in, the, 2011, update, the, start, of, lower, secondary, education, is, characterised, by, the, transition, from, the, single, class, teacher, who, delivers, all, content, to, a, cohort, of, pupils, to, one, where, content, is, delivered, by, a, series, of, subject, specialists, its, educational, aim, is, to, complete, provision, of, basic, education, thereby, completing, the, delivery, of, basic, skills, and, to, lay, the, foundations, for, lifelong, learning, lower, secondary, education, is, likely, to, show, these, criteria, the, end, of, lower, secondary, education, often, coincides, with, the, end, of, compulsory, education, in, countries, where, that, exists, upper, secondary, education, starts, on, the, completion, of, basic, education, which, also, is, defined, as, completion, of, lower, secondary, education, the, educational, focus, is, varied, according, to, the, student, s, interests, and, future, direction, education, at, this, level, is, usually, voluntary, upper, secondary, education, is, likely, to, show, these, criteria, more, subjects, may, be, dropped, and, increased, specialism, occurs, completion, of, upper, secondary, education, provides, the, entry, requirements, to, level, 5, tertiary, education, the, entry, requirements, to, technical, or, vocational, education, level, 4, non, tertiary, course, or, direct, entry, into, the, workplace, in, 2012, the, isced, published, further, work, on, education, levels, where, it, codified, particular, paths, and, redefined, the, tertiary, levels, lower, secondary, education, and, upper, secondary, education, could, last, between, two, and, five, years, and, the, transition, between, two, often, would, be, when, students, were, allowed, some, subject, choice, terminology, for, secondary, schools, varies, by, country, and, the, exact, meaning, of, any, of, these, varies, secondary, schools, may, also, be, called, academies, colleges, gymnasiums, high, schools, lyceums, middle, schools, preparatory, schools, sixth, form, colleges, upper, schools, or, vocational,

that, had, an, alphabet, and, engaged, in, commerce, in, western, europe, formal, secondary, education, can, be, traced, back, to, the, athenian, educational, reforms, of, 320bc, though, their, civilisation, was, eclipsed, and, they, were, enslaved, hellenistic, athenian, teachers, were, valued, in, the, roman, system, the, roman, and, hellenistic, schools, of, rhetoric, taught, the, seven, liberal, arts, and, sciences, grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and, astronomy, which, were, regarded, as, a, preparation, for, the, study, at, a, tertiary, level, of, theology,

school, taught, more, than, the, intended, reading, and, understanding, of, latin, but, the, rules, of, metric, astronomy, and, the, computus, as, well, as, the, works, of, the, saints, even, at, this, stage, there, was, tension, as, the, church, was, worried, that, knowledge, of, latin, would, give, the, student, access, to, non, christian, texts, that, it, would, not, wish, them, to, read,

allowing, the, la, ty, to, interpret, the, bible, in, their, own, way, without, the, intervention, of, priests, and, preferably, in, the, vernacular, this, stimulated, the, foundation, of, free,

catholic, church, and, sons, of, conservative, nobility, schools, started, to, be, set, up, for, the, sons, of, merchants, in, europe, and, the, colonies, too, for, example, boston, latin, grammar, school, 1635, comenius, 1592, 1670, a, moravian, protestant, proposed, a, new, model, of, education, where, ideas, were, developed, from, the, familiar, to, the, theoretical, rather, than, through, repetition, where, languages, were, taught, in, the, vernacular, and, supported, universal, education, in, his, didactica, magna, great, didactic, he, outlined, a, system, of, schools, that, is, the, exact, counterpart, of, many, western, school, systems, kindergarten, elementary, school, secondary, school, six, form, college, university, locke, s, some, thoughts, concerning, education, 1693, stressed, the, importance, of, a, broader, intellectual, training, moral, development, and, physical, hardening, the, grammar, schools, of, the, period, can, be, categorised, in, three, groups, the, nine, leading, schools, seven, of, them, boarding, institutions, which, maintained, the, traditional, curriculum, of, the, classics, and, mostly, served, the, aristocracy, and, the, squirearchy, most, of, the, old, endowed, grammar, schools, serving, a, broad, social, base, in, their, immediate, localities, which, also, stuck, to, the, old, curriculum, the, grammar, schools, situated, in, the, larger, cities, serving, the, families, of, merchants, and, tradesmen, who, embraced, change, during, the, 18th, century, their, social, base, widened, and, their, curriculum, developed, particularly, in, mathematics, and, the, natural, sciences, but, this, was, not, universal, education, and, was, self, selecting, by, wealth, the, industrial, revolution, changed, that, industry, required, an, educated, workforce, where, all, workers, needed, to, have, completed, a, basic, education, in, france, louis, xiv, wrestled, the, control, of, education, from, the, jesuits, condorcet, set, up, coll,

an, employer, to, provide, instruction, in, reading, writing, and, arithmetic, during, at, least, the, first, four, years, of, the, seven, years, of, apprenticeship, the, state, had, accepted, responsibility, for, the, basic, education, of, the, poor, the, provision, of, school, places, remained, inadequate, so, an, order, in, council, dated, 10, april, 1839, created, the, committee, of, the, privy, council, on, education, there, was, considerable, opposition, to, the, idea, that, children, of, all, classes, should, receive, basic, education, all, the, initiatives, such, as, industrial, schools, and, sunday, schools, were, initially, a, private, or, church, initiative, with, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, it, became, clear, just, how, far, behind, the, english, education, system, had, fallen, three, reports, were, commissioned, to, examine, the, education, of, upper, middle, and, labouring, class, children, the, clarendon, commission, sought, to, improve, the, nine, great, public, schools, the, taunton, commission, looked, at, the, 782, endowed, grammar, schools, private, and, public, they, found, varying, quality, and, a, patchy, geographical, coverage, with, two, thirds, of, all, towns, not, having, any, secondary, school, there, was, no, clear, conception, of, the, purpose, of, secondary, education, there, were, only, thirteen, girls, schools, and, their, tuition, was, superficial, unorganised, and, unscientific, they, recommended, a, system, of, first, grade, schools, targeted, at, a, leaving, age, of, 18, as, preparation, for, upper, and, upper, middle, class, boys, entering, university, second, grade, targeted, at, a, leaving, age, of, 16, for, boys, preparing, for, the, army, or, the, newer, professions, and, third, grade, targeted, at, a, leaving, age, of, 14, for, boys, of, small, tenant, farmers, small, tradesmen, and, superior, artisans, this, resulted, in, the, endowed, schools, act, 1869, which, advocated, that, girls, should, enjoy, the, same, education, as, boys, the, newcastle, commission, inquired, into, the, state, of, public, education, in, england, and, to, consider, and, report, what, measures, if, any, are, required, for, the, extension, of, sound, and, cheap, elementary, instruction, to, all, classes, of, the, people, it, produced, 1861, newcastle, report, and, this, led, to, the, elementary, education, act, 1870, 33, 34, vict, c, 75, forster, act, the, school, boards, set, up, by, the, elementary, education, act, 1870, were, stopped, from, providing, secondary, education, by, the, cockerton, judgement, of, 1899, the, school, leaving, age, at, this, time, was, 10, the, judgement, prompted, the, education, act, 1902, balfour, act, compulsory, education, was, extended, to, 12, the, new, local, education, authorities, lea, s, that, were, formed, from, the, school, boards, started, to, open, higher, grade, elementary, schools, isced, level2, or, county, schools, to, supplement, the, endowed, grammar, schools, these, leas, were, allowed, to, build, second, grade, secondary, schools, that, in, the, main, became, the, future, secondary, modern, schools, in, the, 1904, regulations, for, secondary, schools, the, board, of, education, determined, that, secondary, schools, should, offer, a, four, year, subject, based, course, leading, to, a, certificate, in, english, language, and, literature, geography, history, a, foreign, language, mathematics, science, drawing, manual, work, physical, training, and, for, girls, housewifery, the, education, act, 1918, fisher, act, extended, compulsory, full, time, education, to, 14, and, recommended, compulsory, part, time, education, from, 14, to, 18, the, hadlow, report, education, the, adolescent, 1926, proposed, that, there, should, be, a, break, point, at, eleven, establishing, primary, schools, and, secondary, schools, the, united, nations, founded, in, 1947, was, committed, to, education, for, all, but, the, definition, was, difficult, to, formulate, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, 1948, declared, that, elementary, and, fundamental, education, which, it, did, not, define, was, a, right, to, be, enjoyed, by, all, the, education, act, 1944, butler, act, made, sweeping, changes, to, the, funding, of, state, education, using, the, tripartite, system, but, was, not, allowed, to, tackle, private, schools, it, introduced, the, gce, o, level, at, 16, and, the, a, at, 18, but, only, raised, the, school, leaving, age, until, 15, making, the, exam, inaccessible, to, the, majority, but, one, year, of, isced, level, 3, upper, secondary, education, was, mandatory, and, free, in, 1972, the, school, leaving, was, raised, to, 16, the, education, and, skills, act, 2008, when, it, came, into, force, in, the, 2013, academic, year, initially, required, participation, in, some, form, of, education, or, training, until, the, school, year, in, which, the, child, turned, 17, followed, by, the, age, being, raised, to, the, young, person, s, 18th, birthday, in, 2015, this, was, referred, to, as, raising, the, participation, age, to, distinguish, it, from, the, school, leaving, age, which, remains, at, 16, thus, the, uk, is, following, the, isced, level, 3, upper, secondary, education, guideline, the, united, nations, was, strong, in, its, commitment, to, education, for, all, but, fell, into, linguistic, difficulty, defining, that, right, article, i, purposes, and, functions, 1, the, purpose, of, the, organization, is, to, contribute, to, peace, and, security, by, promoting, collaboration, among, the, nations, through, education, science, and, culture, in, order, to, further, universal, respect, for, justice, for, the, rule, of, law, and, for, the, human,

the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, 1948, declared, that, elementary, and, fundamental, education, was, a, right, to, be, enjoyed, by, all, but, again, could, not, define, either, elementary, and, fundamental, education, article, 26, 1, everyone, has, the, right, to, education, education, shall, be, free, at, least, in, the, elementary, and, fundamental, stages, elementary, education, shall, be, compulsory, technical, and, professional, education, shall, be, made, generally, available, and, higher, education, shall, be, equally, accessible, to, all, on, the, basis, of, merit, it, was, assumed, that, elementary, education, was, basic, education, the, entitlement, for, children, and, fundamental, education, was, a, right, for, working, people, but, for, a, lawyer, the, definition, is, neither, qualitative, stating, what, education, means, or, quantitative, saying, when, it, starts, and, when, it, is, completed, the, term, secondary, is, not, defined, or, mentioned, together, this, has, enabled, countries, to, terminate, free, compulsory, basic, education, at, 11, or, only, continue, education, past, eleven, to, boys, article, 28, of, the, convention,
