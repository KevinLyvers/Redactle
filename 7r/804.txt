abortion, is, the, termination, of, a, pregnancy, by, removal, or, expulsion, of, an, embryo, or, fetus, an, abortion, that, occurs, without, intervention, is, known, as, a, miscarriage, or, spontaneous, abortion, these, occur, in, approximately, 30, to, 40, of, all, pregnancies, when, deliberate, steps, are, taken, to, end, a, pregnancy, it, is, called, an, induced, abortion, or, less, frequently, induced, miscarriage, the, unmodified, word, abortion, generally, refers, to, an, induced, abortion, the, most, common, reasons, women, give, for, having, an, abortion, are, for, birth, timing, and, limiting, family, size, other, reasons, reported, include, maternal, health, an, inability, to, afford, a, child, domestic, violence, lack, of, support, feeling, they, are, too, young, wishing, to, complete, education, or, advance, a, career, and, not, being, able, or, willing, to, raise, a, child, conceived, as, a, result, of, rape, or, incest, when, done, legally, in, industrialized, societies, induced, abortion, is, one, of, the, safest, procedures, in, medicine, 1, unsafe, abortions, those, performed, by, people, lacking, the, necessary, skills, or, in, inadequately, resourced, settings, are, responsible, for, between, 5, 13, of, maternal, deaths, especially, in, the, developing, world, however, medication, abortions, that, are, self, managed, are, highly, effective, and, safe, throughout, the, first, trimester, public, health, data, show, that, making, safe, abortion, legal, and, accessible, reduces, maternal, deaths, modern, methods, use, medication, or, surgery, for, abortions, the, drug, mifepristone, aka, ru, 486, in, combination, with, prostaglandin, appears, to, be, as, safe, and, effective, as, surgery, during, the, first, and, second, trimesters, of, pregnancy, the, most, common, surgical, technique, involves, dilating, the, cervix, and, using, a, suction, device, birth, control, such, as, the, pill, or, intrauterine, devices, can, be, used, immediately, following, abortion, when, performed, legally, and, safely, on, a, woman, who, desires, it, induced, abortions, do, not, increase, the, risk, of, long, term, mental, or, physical, problems, in, contrast, unsafe, abortions, performed, by, unskilled, individuals, with, hazardous, equipment, or, in, unsanitary, facilities, cause, between, 22, 000, and, 44, 000, deaths, and, 6, 9, million, hospital, admissions, each, year, the, world, health, organization, states, that, access, to, legal, safe, and, comprehensive, abortion, care, including, post, abortion, care, is, essential, for, the, attainment, of, the, highest, possible, level, of, sexual, and, reproductive, health, historically, abortions, have, been, attempted, using, herbal, medicines, sharp, tools, forceful, massage, or, other, traditional, methods, around, 73, million, abortions, are, performed, each, year, in, the, world, with, about, 45, done, unsafely, abortion, rates, changed, little, between, 2003, and, 2008, before, which, they, decreased, for, at, least, two, decades, as, access, to, family, planning, and, birth, control, increased, as, of, 2018, 37, of, the, world, s, women, had, access, to, legal, abortions, without, limits, as, to, reason, countries, that, permit, abortions, have, different, limits, on, how, late, in, pregnancy, abortion, is, allowed, abortion, rates, are, similar, between, countries, that, restrict, abortion, and, countries, that, broadly, allow, it, though, this, is, partly, because, countries, which, restrict, abortion, tend, to, have, higher, unintended, pregnancy, rates, globally, there, has, been, a, widespread, trend, towards, greater, legal, access, to, abortion, since, 1973, but, there, remains, debate, with, regard, to, moral, religious, ethical, and, legal, issues, those, who, oppose, abortion, often, argue, that, an, embryo, or, fetus, is, a, person, with, a, right, to, life, and, thus, equate, abortion, with, murder, those, who, support, abortion, s, legality, often, argue, that, it, is, a, woman, s, reproductive, right, others, favor, legal, and, accessible, abortion, as, a, public, health, measure, abortion, laws, and, views, of, the, procedure, are, different, around, the, world, in, some, countries, abortion, is, legal, and, women, have, the, right, to, make, the, choice, about, abortion, in, some, areas, abortion, is, legal, only, in, specific, cases, such, as, rape, incest, fetal, defects, poverty, and, risk, to, a, woman, s, health, an, induced, abortion, is, a, medical, procedure, to, end, a, pregnancy, in, modern, english, the, term, abortion, when, used, without, further, qualification, generally, refers, to, induced, abortion, a, pregnancy, can, be, intentionally, aborted, in, several, ways, the, abortion, method, depends, upon, the, gestational, age, of, the, embryo, or, fetus, which, gains, mass, as, the, pregnancy, progresses, abortion, laws, regional, availability, and, the, personal, preference, of, the, women, and, her, doctor, may, inform, the, women, s, choice, of, a, specific, abortion, procedure, abortions, can, be, characterized, as, either, therapeutic, or, elective, when, an, abortion, is, performed, for, medical, reasons, the, procedure, is, referred, to, as, a, therapeutic, abortion, medical, reasons, for, therapeutic, abortion, include, saving, the, life, of, the, pregnant, woman, preventing, harm, to, the, woman, s, physical, or, mental, health, preventing, the, birth, of, a, child, who, will, have, a, significantly, increased, chance, of, mortality, or, morbidity, and, reducing, the, number, of, fetuses, to, lessen, health, risks, associated, with, multiple, pregnancy, an, abortion, is, referred, to, as, elective, or, voluntary, when, it, is, performed, at, the, request, of, the, woman, for, non, medical, reasons, confusion, sometimes, arises, over, the, term, elective, because, elective, surgery, generally, refers, to, all, scheduled, surgery, whether, medically, necessary, or, not, about, one, in, five, pregnancies, worldwide, ends, with, an, induced, abortion, most, abortions, result, from, unintended, pregnancies, in, the, united, kingdom, 1, to, 2, of, abortions, are, done, because, of, genetic, problems, in, the, fetus, miscarriage, also, known, as, spontaneous, abortion, is, the, unintentional, expulsion, of, an, embryo, or, fetus, before, the, 24th, week, of, gestation, a, pregnancy, that, ends, before, 37, weeks, of, gestation, resulting, in, a, live, born, infant, is, a, premature, birth, or, a, preterm, birth, when, a, fetus, dies, in, utero, after, viability, or, during, delivery, it, is, usually, termed, stillborn, premature, births, and, stillbirths, are, generally, not, considered, to, be, miscarriages, although, usage, of, these, terms, can, sometimes, overlap, studies, of, pregnant, women, in, the, us, and, china, have, shown, that, between, 40, and, 60, of, embryos, do, not, progress, to, birth, the, vast, majority, of, miscarriages, occur, before, the, woman, is, aware, that, she, is, pregnant, and, many, pregnancies, spontaneously, abort, before, medical, practitioners, can, detect, an, embryo, between, 15, and, 30, of, known, pregnancies, end, in, clinically, apparent, miscarriage, depending, upon, the, age, and, health, of, the, pregnant, woman, 80, of, these, spontaneous, abortions, happen, in, the, first, trimester, the, most, common, cause, of, spontaneous, abortion, during, the, first, trimester, is, chromosomal, abnormalities, of, the, embryo, or, fetus, accounting, for, at, least, 50, of, sampled, early, pregnancy, losses, other, causes, include, vascular, disease, such, as, lupus, diabetes, other, hormonal, problems, infection, and, abnormalities, of, the, uterus, advancing, maternal, age, and, a, woman, s, history, of, previous, spontaneous, abortions, are, the, two, leading, factors, associated, with, a, greater, risk, of, spontaneous, abortion, a, spontaneous, abortion, can, also, be, caused, by, accidental, trauma, intentional, trauma, or, stress, to, cause, miscarriage, is, considered, induced, abortion, or, feticide, medical, abortions, are, those, induced, by, abortifacient, pharmaceuticals, medical, abortion, became, an, alternative, method, of, abortion, with, the, availability, of, prostaglandin, analogs, in, the, 1970s, and, the, antiprogestogen, mifepristone, also, known, as, ru, 486, in, the, 1980s, the, most, common, early, first, trimester, medical, abortion, regimens, use, mifepristone, in, combination, with, misoprostol, or, sometimes, another, prostaglandin, analog, gemeprost, up, to, 10, weeks, 70, days, gestational, age, methotrexate, in, combination, with, a, prostaglandin, analog, up, to, 7, weeks, gestation, or, a, prostaglandin, analog, alone, mifepristone, misoprostol, combination, regimens, work, faster, and, are, more, effective, at, later, gestational, ages, than, methotrexate, misoprostol, combination, regimens, and, combination, regimens, are, more, effective, than, misoprostol, alone, particularly, in, the, second, trimester, medical, abortion, regimens, involving, mifepristone, followed, by, misoprostol, in, the, cheek, between, 24, and, 48, hours, later, are, effective, when, performed, before, 70, days, gestation, in, very, early, abortions, up, to, 7, weeks, gestation, medical, abortion, using, a, mifepristone, misoprostol, combination, regimen, is, considered, to, be, more, effective, than, surgical, abortion, vacuum, aspiration, especially, when, clinical, practice, does, not, include, detailed, inspection, of, aspirated, tissue, early, medical, abortion, regimens, using, mifepristone, followed, 24, 48, hours, later, by, buccal, or, vaginal, misoprostol, are, 98, effective, up, to, 9, weeks, gestational, age, from, 9, to, 10, weeks, efficacy, decreases, modestly, to, 94, if, medical, abortion, fails, surgical, abortion, must, be, used, to, complete, the, procedure, early, medical, abortions, account, for, the, majority, of, abortions, before, 9, weeks, gestation, in, britain, france, switzerland, united, states, and, the, nordic, countries, medical, abortion, regimens, using, mifepristone, in, combination, with, a, prostaglandin, analog, are, the, most, common, methods, used, for, second, trimester, abortions, in, canada, most, of, europe, china, and, india, in, contrast, to, the, united, states, where, 96, of, second, trimester, abortions, are, performed, surgically, by, dilation, and, evacuation, a, 2020, cochrane, systematic, review, concluded, that, providing, women, with, medications, to, take, home, to, complete, the, second, stage, of, the, procedure, for, an, early, medical, abortion, results, in, an, effective, abortion, further, research, is, required, to, determine, if, self, administered, medical, abortion, is, as, safe, as, provider, administered, medical, abortion, where, a, health, care, professional, is, present, to, help, manage, the, medical, abortion, safely, permitting, women, to, self, administer, abortion, medication, has, the, potential, to, improve, access, to, abortion, the, review, also, noted, a, research, gap, concerning, methods, to, support, women, who, take, medication, at, home, for, a, self, administered, abortion, up, to, 15, weeks, gestation, suction, aspiration, or, vacuum, aspiration, are, the, most, common, surgical, methods, of, induced, abortion, manual, vacuum, aspiration, mva, consists, of, removing, the, fetus, or, embryo, placenta, and, membranes, by, suction, using, a, manual, syringe, while, electric, vacuum, aspiration, eva, uses, an, electric, pump, both, techniques, can, be, used, very, early, in, pregnancy, mva, can, be, used, up, to, 14, weeks, but, is, more, often, used, earlier, in, the, u, s, eva, can, be, used, later, mva, also, known, as, mini, suction, and, menstrual, extraction, or, eva, can, be, used, in, very, early, pregnancy, when, cervical, dilation, may, not, be, required, dilation, and, curettage, d, c, refers, to, opening, the, cervix, dilation, and, removing, tissue, curettage, via, suction, or, sharp, instruments, d, c, is, a, standard, gynecological, procedure, performed, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, examination, of, the, uterine, lining, for, possible, malignancy, investigation, of, abnormal, bleeding, and, abortion, the, world, health, organization, recommends, sharp, curettage, only, when, suction, aspiration, is, unavailable, dilation, and, evacuation, d, e, used, after, 12, to, 16, weeks, consists, of, opening, the, cervix, and, emptying, the, uterus, using, surgical, instruments, and, suction, d, e, is, performed, vaginally, and, does, not, require, an, incision, intact, dilation, and, extraction, d, x, refers, to, a, variant, of, d, e, sometimes, used, after, 18, to, 20, weeks, when, removal, of, an, intact, fetus, improves, surgical, safety, or, for, other, reasons, abortion, may, also, be, performed, surgically, by, hysterotomy, or, gravid, hysterectomy, hysterotomy, abortion, is, a, procedure, similar, to, a, caesarean, section, and, is, performed, under, general, anesthesia, it, requires, a, smaller, incision, than, a, caesarean, section, and, can, be, used, during, later, stages, of, pregnancy, gravid, hysterectomy, refers, to, removal, of, the, whole, uterus, while, still, containing, the, pregnancy, hysterotomy, and, hysterectomy, are, associated, with, much, higher, rates, of, maternal, morbidity, and, mortality, than, d, e, or, induction, abortion, first, trimester, procedures, can, generally, be, performed, using, local, anesthesia, while, second, trimester, methods, may, require, deep, sedation, or, general, anesthesia, in, places, lacking, the, necessary, medical, skill, for, dilation, and, extraction, or, when, preferred, by, practitioners, an, abortion, can, be, induced, by, first, inducing, labor, and, then, inducing, fetal, demise, if, necessary, this, is, sometimes, called, induced, miscarriage, this, procedure, may, be, performed, from, 13, weeks, gestation, to, the, third, trimester, although, it, is, very, uncommon, in, the, united, states, more, than, 80, of, induced, abortions, throughout, the, second, trimester, are, labor, induced, abortions, in, sweden, and, other, nearby, countries, only, limited, data, are, available, comparing, labor, induced, abortion, with, the, dilation, and, extraction, method, unlike, d, e, labor, induced, abortions, after, 18, weeks, may, be, complicated, by, the, occurrence, of, brief, fetal, survival, which, may, be, legally, characterized, as, live, birth, for, this, reason, labor, induced, abortion, is, legally, risky, in, the, united, states, historically, a, number, of, herbs, reputed, to, possess, abortifacient, properties, have, been, used, in, folk, medicine, such, herbs, include, tansy, pennyroyal, black, cohosh, and, the, now, extinct, silphium, 44, 47, 62, 63, 154, 155, 230, 231, in, 1978, one, woman, in, colorado, died, and, another, developed, organ, damage, when, they, attempted, to, terminate, their, pregnancies, by, taking, pennyroyal, oil, because, the, indiscriminant, use, of, herbs, as, abortifacients, can, cause, serious, even, lethal, side, effects, such, as, multiple, organ, failure, such, use, is, not, recommended, by, physicians, abortion, is, sometimes, attempted, by, causing, trauma, to, the, abdomen, the, degree, of, force, if, severe, can, cause, serious, internal, injuries, without, necessarily, succeeding, in, inducing, miscarriage, in, southeast, asia, there, is, an, ancient, tradition, of, attempting, abortion, through, forceful, abdominal, massage, one, of, the, bas, reliefs, decorating, the, temple, of, angkor, wat, in, cambodia, depicts, a, demon, performing, such, an, abortion, upon, a, woman, who, has, been, sent, to, the, underworld, reported, methods, of, unsafe, self, induced, abortion, include, misuse, of, misoprostol, and, insertion, of, non, surgical, implements, such, as, knitting, needles, and, clothes, hangers, into, the, uterus, these, and, other, methods, to, terminate, pregnancy, may, be, called, induced, miscarriage, such, methods, are, rarely, used, in, countries, where, surgical, abortion, is, legal, and, available, the, health, risks, of, abortion, depend, principally, on, how, and, under, what, conditions, the, procedure, is, performed, the, world, health, organization, who, defines, unsafe, abortions, as, those, performed, by, unskilled, individuals, with, hazardous, equipment, or, in, unsanitary, facilities, legal, abortions, performed, in, the, developed, world, are, among, the, safest, procedures, in, medicine, according, to, a, 2012, study, in, obstetrics, gynecology, in, the, united, states, the, risk, of, maternal, mortality, is, 14, times, lower, after, induced, abortion, than, after, childbirth, the, cdc, estimated, in, 2019, that, us, pregnancy, related, mortality, was, 17, 2, maternal, deaths, per, 100, 000, live, births, while, the, us, abortion, mortality, rate, was, 0, 43, maternal, deaths, per, 100, 000, procedures, in, the, uk, guidelines, of, the, royal, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynaecologists, state, that, women, should, be, advised, that, abortion, is, generally, safer, than, continuing, a, pregnancy, to, term, worldwide, on, average, abortion, is, safer, than, carrying, a, pregnancy, to, term, a, 2007, study, reported, that, 26, of, all, pregnancies, worldwide, are, terminated, by, induced, abortion, whereas, deaths, from, improperly, performed, procedures, constitute, 13, of, maternal, mortality, globally, in, indonesia, in, 2000, it, was, estimated, that, 2, million, pregnancies, ended, in, abortion, 4, 5, million, pregnancies, were, carried, to, term, and, 14, 16, percent, of, maternal, deaths, resulted, from, abortion, in, the, us, from, 2000, to, 2009, abortion, had, a, mortality, rate, lower, than, plastic, surgery, lower, or, similar, to, running, a, marathon, and, about, equivalent, to, traveling, 760, miles, 1, 220, km, in, a, passenger, car, five, years, after, seeking, abortion, services, women, who, gave, birth, after, being, denied, an, abortion, reported, worse, health, than, women, who, had, either, first, or, second, trimester, abortions, the, risk, of, abortion, related, mortality, increases, with, gestational, age, but, remains, lower, than, that, of, childbirth, outpatient, abortion, is, as, safe, from, 64, to, 70, days, gestation, as, it, before, 63, days, there, is, little, difference, in, terms, of, safety, and, efficacy, between, medical, abortion, using, a, combined, regimen, of, mifepristone, and, misoprostol, and, surgical, abortion, vacuum, aspiration, in, early, first, trimester, abortions, up, to, 10, weeks, gestation, medical, abortion, using, the, prostaglandin, analog, misoprostol, alone, is, less, effective, and, more, painful, than, medical, abortion, using, a, combined, regimen, of, mifepristone, and, misoprostol, or, surgical, abortion, vacuum, aspiration, in, the, first, trimester, is, the, safest, method, of, surgical, abortion, and, can, be, performed, in, a, primary, care, office, abortion, clinic, or, hospital, complications, which, are, rare, can, include, uterine, perforation, pelvic, infection, and, retained, products, of, conception, requiring, a, second, procedure, to, evacuate, infections, account, for, one, third, of, abortion, related, deaths, in, the, united, states, the, rate, of, complications, of, vacuum, aspiration, abortion, in, the, first, trimester, is, similar, regardless, of, whether, the, procedure, is, performed, in, a, hospital, surgical, center, or, office, preventive, antibiotics, such, as, doxycycline, or, metronidazole, are, typically, given, before, abortion, procedures, as, they, are, believed, to, substantially, reduce, the, risk, of, postoperative, uterine, infection, however, antibiotics, are, not, routinely, given, with, abortion, pills, the, rate, of, failed, procedures, does, not, appear, to, vary, significantly, depending, on, whether, the, abortion, is, performed, by, a, doctor, or, a, mid, level, practitioner, complications, after, second, trimester, abortion, are, similar, to, those, after, first, trimester, abortion, and, depend, somewhat, on, the, method, chosen, the, risk, of, death, from, abortion, approaches, roughly, half, the, risk, of, death, from, childbirth, the, farther, along, a, woman, is, in, pregnancy, from, one, in, a, million, before, 9, weeks, gestation, to, nearly, one, in, ten, thousand, at, 21, weeks, or, more, as, measured, from, the, last, menstrual, period, it, appears, that, having, had, a, prior, surgical, uterine, evacuation, whether, because, of, induced, abortion, or, treatment, of, miscarriage, correlates, with, a, small, increase, in, the, risk, of, preterm, birth, in, future, pregnancies, the, studies, supporting, this, did, not, control, for, factors, not, related, to, abortion, or, miscarriage, and, hence, the, causes, of, this, correlation, have, not, been, determined, although, multiple, possibilities, have, been, suggested, current, evidence, finds, no, relationship, between, most, induced, abortions, and, mental, health, problems, other, than, those, expected, for, any, unwanted, pregnancy, a, report, by, the, american, psychological, association, concluded, that, a, woman, s, first, abortion, is, not, a, threat, to, mental, health, when, carried, out, in, the, first, trimester, with, such, women, no, more, likely, to, have, mental, health, problems, than, those, carrying, an, unwanted, pregnancy, to, term, the, mental, health, outcome, of, a, woman, s, second, or, greater, abortion, is, less, certain, some, older, reviews, concluded, that, abortion, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, psychological, problems, however, later, reviews, of, the, medical, literature, found, that, previous, reviews, did, not, use, an, appropriate, control, group, when, a, control, group, is, utilized, receiving, abortion, is, not, associated, with, adverse, psychological, outcomes, however, women, seeking, abortion, who, are, denied, access, to, abortion, have, an, increase, in, anxiety, after, the, denial, although, some, studies, show, negative, mental, health, outcomes, in, women, who, choose, abortions, after, the, first, trimester, because, of, fetal, abnormalities, more, rigorous, research, would, be, needed, to, show, this, conclusively, some, proposed, negative, psychological, effects, of, abortion, have, been, referred, to, by, anti, abortion, advocates, as, a, separate, condition, called, post, abortion, syndrome, but, this, is, not, recognized, by, medical, or, psychological, professionals, in, the, united, states, a, 2020, long, term, study, among, us, women, found, that, about, 99, of, women, felt, that, they, made, the, right, decision, five, years, after, they, had, an, abortion, relief, was, the, primary, emotion, with, few, women, feeling, sadness, or, guilt, social, stigma, was, a, main, factor, predicting, negative, emotions, and, regret, years, later, the, researchers, also, stated, these, results, add, to, the, scientific, evidence, that, emotions, about, an, abortion, are, associated, with, personal, and, social, context, and, are, not, a, product, of, the, abortion, procedure, itself, some, purported, risks, of, abortion, are, promoted, primarily, by, anti, abortion, groups, but, lack, scientific, support, for, example, the, question, of, a, link, between, induced, abortion, and, breast, cancer, has, been, investigated, extensively, major, medical, and, scientific, bodies, including, the, who, national, cancer, institute, american, cancer, society, royal, college, of, obgyn, and, american, congress, of, obgyn, have, concluded, that, abortion, does, not, cause, breast, cancer, in, the, past, even, illegality, has, not, automatically, meant, that, the, abortions, were, unsafe, referring, to, the, u, s, historian, linda, gordon, states, in, fact, illegal, abortions, in, this, country, have, an, impressive, safety, record, 25, according, to, rickie, solinger, a, related, myth, promulgated, by, a, broad, spectrum, of, people, concerned, about, abortion, and, public, policy, is, that, before, legalization, abortionists, were, dirty, and, dangerous, back, alley, butchers, he, historical, evidence, does, not, support, such, claims, 4, a, 1940s, american, physician, spoke, of, his, pride, in, having, performed, 13, 844, illegal, abortions, without, any, fatalities, in, 1870s, new, york, city, the, abortionist, midwife, madame, restell, anna, trow, lohman, is, said, to, have, lost, very, few, women, among, her, more, than, 100, 000, patients, a, lower, mortality, rate, than, the, childbirth, mortality, rate, at, the, time, in, 1936, obstetrics, and, gynecology, professor, frederick, j, taussig, wrote, that, a, cause, of, increasing, mortality, during, the, years, of, illegality, in, the, u, s, was, that, with, each, decade, of, the, past, fifty, years, the, actual, and, proportionate, frequency, of, this, accident, has, increased, due, first, to, the, increase, in, the, number, of, instrumentally, induced, abortions, second, to, the, proportionate, increase, in, abortions, handled, by, doctors, as, against, those, handled, by, midwives, and, third, to, the, prevailing, tendency, to, use, instruments, instead, of, the, finger, in, emptying, the, uterus, women, seeking, an, abortion, may, use, unsafe, methods, especially, when, abortion, is, legally, restricted, they, may, attempt, self, induced, abortion, or, seek, the, help, of, a, person, without, proper, medical, training, or, facilities, this, can, lead, to, severe, complications, such, as, incomplete, abortion, sepsis, hemorrhage, and, damage, to, internal, organs, unsafe, abortions, are, a, major, cause, of, injury, and, death, among, women, worldwide, although, data, are, imprecise, it, is, estimated, that, approximately, 20, million, unsafe, abortions, are, performed, annually, with, 97, taking, place, in, developing, countries, unsafe, abortions, are, believed, to, result, in, millions, of, injuries, estimates, of, deaths, vary, according, to, methodology, and, have, ranged, from, 37, 000, to, 70, 000, in, the, past, decade, deaths, from, unsafe, abortion, account, for, around, 13, of, all, maternal, deaths, the, world, health, organization, believes, that, mortality, has, fallen, since, the, 1990s, to, reduce, the, number, of, unsafe, abortions, public, health, organizations, have, generally, advocated, emphasizing, the, legalization, of, abortion, training, of, medical, personnel, and, ensuring, access, to, reproductive, health, services, a, major, factor, in, whether, abortions, are, performed, safely, or, not, is, the, legal, standing, of, abortion, countries, with, restrictive, abortion, laws, have, higher, rates, of, unsafe, abortion, and, similar, overall, abortion, rates, compared, to, countries, where, abortion, is, legal, and, available, for, example, the, 1996, legalization, of, abortion, in, south, africa, led, to, an, immediate, reduction, in, abortion, related, complications, with, abortion, related, deaths, dropping, by, more, than, 90, similar, reductions, in, maternal, mortality, have, been, observed, after, other, countries, have, liberalized, their, abortion, laws, such, as, romania, and, nepal, a, 2011, study, concluded, that, in, the, united, states, some, state, level, anti, abortion, laws, are, correlated, with, lower, rates, of, abortion, in, that, state, the, analysis, however, did, not, take, into, account, travel, to, other, states, without, such, laws, to, obtain, an, abortion, in, addition, a, lack, of, access, to, effective, contraception, contributes, to, unsafe, abortion, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, incidence, of, unsafe, abortion, could, be, reduced, by, up, to, 75, from, 20, million, to, 5, million, annually, if, modern, family, planning, and, maternal, health, services, were, readily, available, globally, rates, of, such, abortions, may, be, difficult, to, measure, because, they, can, be, reported, variously, as, miscarriage, induced, miscarriage, menstrual, regulation, mini, abortion, and, regulation, of, a, delayed, suspended, menstruation, forty, percent, of, the, world, s, women, are, able, to, access, therapeutic, and, elective, abortions, within, gestational, limits, while, an, additional, 35, percent, have, access, to, legal, abortion, if, they, meet, certain, physical, mental, or, socioeconomic, criteria, while, maternal, mortality, seldom, results, from, safe, abortions, unsafe, abortions, result, in, 70, 000, deaths, and, 5, million, disabilities, per, year, complications, of, unsafe, abortion, account, for, approximately, an, eighth, of, maternal, mortalities, worldwide, though, this, varies, by, region, secondary, infertility, caused, by, an, unsafe, abortion, affects, an, estimated, 24, million, women, the, rate, of, unsafe, abortions, has, increased, from, 44, to, 49, between, 1995, and, 2008, health, education, access, to, family, planning, and, improvements, in, health, care, during, and, after, abortion, have, been, proposed, to, address, consequences, of, unsafe, abortion, there, are, two, commonly, used, methods, of, measuring, the, incidence, of, abortion, in, many, places, where, abortion, is, illegal, or, carries, a, heavy, social, stigma, medical, reporting, of, abortion, is, not, reliable, for, this, reason, estimates, of, the, incidence, of, abortion, must, be, made, without, determining, certainty, related, to, standard, error, the, number, of, abortions, performed, worldwide, was, characterized, as, stable, in, the, early, 2000s, with, 41, 6, million, having, been, performed, in, 2003, and, 43, 8, million, having, been, performed, in, 2008, the, abortion, rate, worldwide, was, 28, per, 1000, women, per, year, though, it, was, 24, per, 1000, women, per, year, for, developed, countries, and, 29, per, 1000, women, per, year, for, developing, countries, the, same, 2012, study, indicated, that, in, 2008, the, estimated, abortion, percentage, of, known, pregnancies, was, at, 21, worldwide, with, 26, in, developed, countries, and, 20, in, developing, countries, on, average, the, incidence, of, abortion, is, similar, in, countries, with, restrictive, abortion, laws, and, those, with, more, liberal, access, to, abortion, restrictive, abortion, laws, are, associated, with, increases, in, the, percentage, of, abortions, performed, unsafely, the, unsafe, abortion, rate, in, developing, countries, is, partly, attributable, to, lack, of, access, to, modern, contraceptives, according, to, the, guttmacher, institute, providing, access, to, contraceptives, would, result, in, about, 14, 5, million, fewer, unsafe, abortions, and, 38, 000, fewer, deaths, from, unsafe, abortion, annually, worldwide, the, rate, of, legal, induced, abortion, varies, extensively, worldwide, according, to, the, report, of, employees, of, guttmacher, institute, it, ranged, from, 7, per, 1000, women, per, year, germany, and, switzerland, to, 30, per, 1000, women, per, year, estonia, in, countries, with, complete, statistics, in, 2008, the, proportion, of, pregnancies, that, ended, in, induced, abortion, ranged, from, about, 10, israel, the, netherlands, and, switzerland, to, 30, estonia, in, the, same, group, though, it, might, be, as, high, as, 36, in, hungary, and, romania, whose, statistics, were, deemed, incomplete, an, american, study, in, 2002, concluded, that, about, half, of, women, having, abortions, were, using, a, form, of, contraception, at, the, time, of, becoming, pregnant, inconsistent, use, was, reported, by, half, of, those, using, condoms, and, three, quarters, of, those, using, the, birth, control, pill, 42, of, those, using, condoms, reported, failure, through, slipping, or, breakage, of, the, other, half, of, women, who, were, not, using, contraception, at, the, time, of, becoming, pregnant, the, vast, majority, had, used, contraception, at, some, point, in, the, past, indicating, some, level, of, dissatisfaction, with, the, contraceptive, options, available, to, them, indeed, 32, of, these, contraceptive, nonusers, cited, concerns, about, contraceptive, methods, as, their, reason, for, nonuse, and, a, more, recent, study, found, similar, results, taken, together, these, statistics, suggest, that, new, contraceptive, methods, such, as, non, hormonal, contraceptives, or, male, contraceptives, could, reduce, unintended, pregnancy, and, abortion, rates, the, guttmacher, institute, has, found, that, most, abortions, in, the, united, states, are, obtained, by, minority, women, because, minority, women, have, much, higher, rates, of, unintended, pregnancy, in, a, 2022, analysis, by, the, kaiser, family, foundation, while, people, of, color, comprise, 44, of, the, population, in, mississippi, 59, of, the, population, in, texas, 42, of, the, population, in, louisiana, and, 35, of, the, population, in, alabama, they, comprise, 80, 74, 72, and, 70, respectively, of, those, receiving, abortions, abortion, rates, vary, depending, on, the, stage, of, pregnancy, and, the, method, practiced, in, 2003, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, reported, that, 26, of, reported, legal, induced, abortions, in, the, united, states, were, known, to, have, been, obtained, at, the, end, of, 6, weeks, of, gestation, or, less, 18, at, 7, weeks, 15, at, 8, weeks, 18, at, 9, through, 10, weeks, 10, at, 11, through, 12, weeks, 6, at, 13, through, 15, weeks, 4, at, 16, through, 20, weeks, and, 1, at, more, than, 21, weeks, 91, of, these, were, classified, as, having, been, done, by, curettage, suction, aspiration, dilation, and, curettage, dilation, and, evacuation, 8, by, medical, means, mifepristone, 1, by, intrauterine, instillation, saline, or, prostaglandin, and, 1, by, other, including, hysterotomy, and, hysterectomy, according, to, the, cdc, due, to, data, collection, difficulties, the, data, must, be, viewed, as, tentative, and, some, fetal, deaths, reported, beyond, 20, weeks, may, be, natural, deaths, erroneously, classified, as, abortions, if, the, removal, of, the, dead, fetus, is, accomplished, by, the, same, procedure, as, an, induced, abortion, the, guttmacher, institute, estimated, there, were, 2, 200, intact, dilation, and, extraction, procedures, in, the, us, during, 2000, this, accounts, for, 0, 2, of, the, total, number, of, abortions, performed, that, year, similarly, in, england, and, wales, in, 2006, 89, of, terminations, occurred, at, or, under, 12, weeks, 9, between, 13, and, 19, weeks, and, 2, at, or, over, 20, weeks, 64, of, those, reported, were, by, vacuum, aspiration, 6, by, d, e, and, 30, were, medical, there, are, more, second, trimester, abortions, in, developing, countries, such, as, china, india, and, vietnam, than, in, developed, countries, there, are, both, medical, and, non, medical, reasons, to, have, an, abortion, later, in, pregnancy, after, 20, weeks, a, study, was, conducted, from, 2008, to, 2010, at, the, university, of, california, san, francisco, where, more, than, 440, women, were, asked, about, why, they, experienced, delays, in, obtaining, abortion, care, if, there, were, any, this, study, found, that, almost, half, of, individuals, who, obtained, an, abortion, after, 20, weeks, did, not, suspect, that, they, were, pregnant, until, later, in, their, pregnancy, other, barriers, to, abortion, care, found, in, the, study, included, lack, of, information, about, where, to, access, an, abortion, difficulties, with, transportation, lack, of, insurance, coverage, and, inability, to, pay, for, the, abortion, procedure, medical, reasons, for, seeking, an, abortion, later, in, pregnancy, include, fetal, anomalies, and, health, risk, to, the, pregnant, person, there, are, prenatal, tests, that, can, diagnose, down, syndrome, or, cystic, fibrosis, as, early, as, 10, weeks, into, gestation, but, structural, fetal, anomalies, are, often, detected, much, later, in, pregnancy, a, proportion, of, structural, fetal, anomalies, are, lethal, which, means, that, the, fetus, will, almost, certainly, die, before, or, shortly, after, birth, life, threatening, conditions, may, also, develop, later, in, pregnancy, such, as, early, severe, preeclampsia, newly, diagnosed, cancer, in, need, of, urgent, treatment, and, intrauterine, infection, chorioamnionitis, which, often, occurs, along, with, premature, rupture, of, the, amniotic, sac, pprom, if, serious, medical, conditions, such, as, these, arise, before, the, fetus, is, viable, the, person, carrying, the, pregnancy, may, pursue, an, abortion, to, preserve, their, own, health, the, reasons, why, women, have, abortions, are, diverse, and, vary, across, the, world, some, of, the, reasons, may, include, an, inability, to, afford, a, child, domestic, violence, lack, of, support, feeling, they, are, too, young, and, the, wish, to, complete, education, or, advance, a, career, additional, reasons, include, not, being, able, or, willing, to, raise, a, child, conceived, as, a, result, of, rape, or, incest, some, abortions, are, undergone, as, the, result, of, societal, pressures, these, might, include, the, preference, for, children, of, a, specific, sex, or, race, disapproval, of, single, or, early, motherhood, stigmatization, of, people, with, disabilities, insufficient, economic, support, for, families, lack, of, access, to, or, rejection, of, contraceptive, methods, or, efforts, toward, population, control, such, as, china, s, one, child, policy, these, factors, can, sometimes, result, in, compulsory, abortion, or, sex, selective, abortion, in, cultures, where, there, is, a, preference, for, male, children, some, women, have, sex, selective, abortions, which, have, partially, replaced, the, earlier, practice, of, female, infanticide, some, abortions, are, performed, due, to, concerns, over, maternal, health, in, 1990s, women, cited, maternal, health, as, their, main, motivating, factor, in, about, a, third, of, abortions, in, three, of, 27, countries, analyzed, in, seven, additional, countries, about, 7, of, abortions, were, maternal, health, related, in, the, u, s, the, supreme, court, decisions, in, roe, v, wade, and, doe, v, bolton, ruled, that, the, state, s, interest, in, the, life, of, the, fetus, became, compelling, only, at, the, point, of, viability, defined, as, the, point, at, which, the, fetus, can, survive, independently, of, its, mother, even, after, the, point, of, viability, the, state, cannot, favor, the, life, of, the, fetus, over, the, life, or, health, of, the, pregnant, woman, under, the, right, of, privacy, physicians, must, be, free, to, use, their, medical, judgment, for, the, preservation, of, the, life, or, health, of, the, mother, on, the, same, day, that, the, court, decided, roe, it, also, decided, doe, v, bolton, in, which, the, court, defined, health, very, broadly, the, medical, judgment, may, be, exercised, in, the, light, of, all, factors, physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and, the,

medical, judgment, 1200, 1201, the, rate, of, cancer, during, pregnancy, is, 0, 02, 1, and, in, many, cases, cancer, of, the, mother, leads, to, consideration, of, abortion, to, protect, the, life, of, the, mother, or, in, response, to, the, potential, damage, that, may, occur, to, the, fetus, during, treatment, this, is, particularly, true, for, cervical, cancer, the, most, common, type, of, which, occurs, in, 1, of, every, 2, 000, 13, 000, pregnancies, for, which, initiation, of, treatment, cannot, co, exist, with, preservation, of, fetal, life, unless, neoadjuvant, chemotherapy, is,

civilizations, as, varied, as, ancient, china, abortifacient, knowledge, is, often, attributed, to, the, mythological, ruler, shennong, ancient, india, since, its, vedic, age, ancient, egypt, with, its, ebers, papyrus, c, 1550, bce, and, the, roman, empire, in, the, time, of, juvenal, c, 200, ce, one, of, the, earliest, known, artistic, representations, of, abortion, is, in, a, bas, relief, at,

enters, the, fetus, considered, by, various, theologians, to, be, at, conception, 40, days, after, conception, 120, days, after, conception, or, at, quickening, abortion, is, largely, heavily, restricted, or, forbidden, in, areas, of, high, islamic, faith, such, as, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, some, medical, scholars, and, abortion, opponents, have, suggested, that, the, hippocratic, oath, forbade, physicians, in, ancient, greece, from, performing, abortions, other, scholars, disagree, with, this, interpretation, and, state, that, the, medical, texts, of, hippocratic, corpus, contain, descriptions, of, abortive, techniques, right, alongside, the, oath, the, physician, scribonius, largus, wrote, in, 43, ce, that, the, hippocratic, oath, prohibits, abortion, as, did, soranus, of, ephesus, although, apparently, not, all, doctors, adhered, to, it, strictly, at, the, time, according, to, soranus, 1st, or, 2nd, century, ce, work, gynaecology, one, party, of, medical, practitioners, banished, all, abortives, as, required, by, the, hippocratic, oath, the, other, party, to, which, he, belonged, was, willing, to, prescribe, abortions, only, for, the, sake, of, the, mother, s, health, in, politics, 350, bce, aristotle, condemned, infanticide, as, a, means, of, population, control, he, preferred, abortion, in, such, cases, with, the, restriction, that, it, must, be, practised, on, it, before, it, has, developed, sensation, and, life, for, the, line, between, lawful, and, unlawful, abortion, will, be, marked, by, the, fact, of, having, sensation, and, being, alive, in, the, catholic, church, opinion, was, divided, on, how, serious, abortion, was, in, comparison, with, such, acts, as, contraception, oral, sex, and, sex, in, marriage, for, pleasure, rather, than, procreation, 155, 167, the, catholic, church, did, not, begin, vigorously, opposing, abortion, until, the, 19th, century, as, early, as, 100, ce, the, didache, taught, that, abortion, was, sinful, several, historians, argue, that, prior, to, the, 19th, century, most, catholic, authors, did, not, regard, termination, of, pregnancy, before, quickening, or, ensoulment, as, an, abortion, among, these, authors, were, the, doctors, of, the, church, such, as, st, augustine, st, thomas, aquinas, and, st, alphonsus, liguori, in, 1588, pope, sixtus, v, r, 1585, 1590, was, the, only, pope, before, pope, pius, ix, in, his, 1869, bull, apostolicae, sedis, to, institute, a, church, policy, labeling, all, abortion, as, homicide, and, condemning, abortion, regardless, of, the, stage, of, pregnancy, 362, 364, 157, 158, sixtus, v, s, pronouncement, was, reversed, in, 1591, by, pope, gregory, xiv, in, the, recodification, of, 1917, code, of, canon, law, apostolicae, sedis, was, strengthened, in, part, to, remove, a, possible, reading, that, excluded, excommunication, of, the, mother, statements, made, in, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, the, codified, summary, of, the, church, s, teachings, considers, abortion, from, the, moment, of, conception, as, homicide, and, called, for, the, end, of, legal, abortion, denominations, that, support, abortion, rights, with, some, limits, include, the, united, methodist, church, episcopal, church, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, and, presbyterian, church, usa, a, 2014, guttmacher, survey, of, abortion, patients, in, the, united, states, found, that, many, reported, a, religious, affiliation, 24, were, catholic, while, 30, were, protestant, a, 1995, survey, reported, that, catholic, women, are, as, likely, as, the, general, population, to, terminate, a, pregnancy, protestants, are, less, likely, to, do, so, and, evangelical, christians, are, the, least, likely, to, do, so, a, 2019, pew, research, center, study, found, that, most, christian, denominations, were, against, overturning, roe, v, wade, which, in, the, united, states, legalized, abortion, at, around, 70, except, white, evangelicals, at, 35, abortion, has, been, a, fairly, common, practice, and, was, not, always, illegal, or, controversial, until, the, 19th, century, under, common, law, including, early, english, common, law, dating, back, to, edward, coke, in, 1648, abortion, was, generally, permitted, before, quickening, 14, 26, weeks, after, conception, or, between, the, fourth, and, sixth, month, and, at, women, s, discretion, it, was, whether, abortion, was, performed, after, quickening, that, determined, if, it, was, a, crime, in, europe, and, north, america, abortion, techniques, advanced, starting, in, the, 17th, century, the, conservatism, of, most, in, the, medical, profession, with, regards, to, sexual, matters, prevented, the, wide, expansion, of, abortion, techniques, other, medical, practitioners, in, addition, to, some, physicians, advertised, their, services, and, they, were, not, widely, regulated, until, the, 19th, century, when, the, practice, sometimes, called, restellism, was, banned, in, both, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, some, 19th, century, physicians, one, of, the, most, famous, and, consequential, being, the, american, horatio, storer, argued, for, anti, abortion, laws, on, racist, and, misogynist, as, well, as, moral, grounds, church, groups, were, also, highly, influential, in, anti, abortion, movements, and, religious, groups, more, so, since, the, 20th, century, some, of, the, early, anti, abortion, laws, punished, only, the, doctor, or, abortionist, and, while, women, could, be, criminally, tried, for, a, self, induced, abortion, they, were, rarely, prosecuted, in, general, in, the, united, states, some, argued, that, abortion, was, more, dangerous, than, childbirth, until, about, 1930, when, incremental, improvements, in, abortion, procedures, relative, to, childbirth, made, abortion, safer, others, maintain, that, in, the, 19th, century, early, abortions, under, the, hygienic, conditions, in, which, midwives, usually, worked, were, relatively, safe, several, scholars, argue, that, despite, improved, medical, procedures, the, period, from, the, 1930s, until, the, 1970s, saw, more, zealous, enforcement, of, anti, abortion, laws, alongside, an, increasing, control, of, abortion, providers, by, organized, crime, in, 1920, soviet, russia, became, the, first, country, to, legalize, abortion, after, lenin, insisted, that, no, woman, be, forced, to, give, birth, iceland, 1935, and, sweden, 1938, would, follow, suit, to, legalize, certain, or, all, forms, of, abortion, in, nazi, germany, 1935, a, law, permitted, abortions, for, those, deemed, hereditarily, ill, while, women, considered, of, german, stock, were, specifically, prohibited, from, having, abortions, beginning, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, abortion, was, legalized, in, a, greater, number, of, countries, in, japan, abortion, was, first, legalized, by, the, 1948, eugenics, protection, law, meant, to, prevent, the,
