heterodox, economic, growth, can, be, defined, as, the, increase, or, improvement, in, the, inflation, adjusted, market, value, of, the, goods, and, services, produced, by, an, economy, in, a, financial, year, statisticians, conventionally, measure, such, growth, as, the, percent, rate, of, increase, in, the, real, and, nominal, gross, domestic, product, gdp, growth, is, usually, calculated, in, real, terms, i, e, inflation, adjusted, terms, to, eliminate, the, distorting, effect, of, inflation, on, the, prices, of, goods, produced, measurement, of, economic, growth, uses, national, income, accounting, since, economic, growth, is, measured, as, the, annual, percent, change, of, gross, domestic, product, gdp, it, has, all, the, advantages, and, drawbacks, of, that, measure, the, economic, growth, rates, of, countries, are, commonly, compared, using, the, ratio, of, the, gdp, to, population, or, per, capita, income, the, rate, of, economic, growth, refers, to, the, geometric, annual, rate, of, growth, in, gdp, between, the, first, and, the, last, year, over, a, period, of, time, this, growth, rate, represents, the, trend, in, the, average, level, of, gdp, over, the, period, and, ignores, any, fluctuations, in, the, gdp, around, this, trend, economists, refer, to, economic, growth, caused, by, more, efficient, use, of, inputs, increased, productivity, of, labor, of, physical, capital, of, energy, or, of, materials, as, intensive, growth, in, contrast, gdp, growth, caused, only, by, increases, in, the, amount, of, inputs, available, for, use, increased, population, for, example, or, new, territory, counts, as, extensive, growth, development, of, new, goods, and, services, also, generates, economic, growth, as, it, so, happens, in, the, u, s, about, 60, of, consumer, spending, in, 2013, went, on, goods, and, services, that, did, not, exist, in, 1869, the, economic, growth, rate, is, typically, calculated, as, real, gdp, growth, rate, real, gdp, per, capita, growth, rate, or, gni, per, capita, growth, living, standards, vary, widely, from, country, to, country, and, furthermore, the, change, in, living, standards, over, time, varies, widely, from, country, to, country, below, is, a, table, which, shows, gdp, per, person, and, annualized, per, person, gdp, growth, for, a, selection, of, countries, over, a, period, of, about, 100, years, the, gdp, per, person, data, are, adjusted, for, inflation, hence, they, are, real, gdp, per, person, more, commonly, called, per, capita, gdp, is, the, gdp, of, the, entire, country, divided, by, the, number, of, people, in, the, country, gdp, per, person, is, conceptually, analogous, to, average, income, seemingly, small, differences, in, yearly, gdp, growth, lead, to, large, changes, in, gdp, when, compounded, over, time, for, instance, in, the, above, table, gdp, per, person, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, year, 1870, was, 4, 808, at, the, same, time, in, the, united, states, gdp, per, person, was, 4, 007, lower, than, the, uk, by, about, 20, however, in, 2008, the, positions, were, reversed, gdp, per, person, was, 36, 130, in, the, united, kingdom, and, 46, 970, in, the, united, states, i, e, gdp, per, person, in, the, us, was, 30, more, than, it, was, in, the, uk, as, the, above, table, shows, this, means, that, gdp, per, person, grew, on, average, by, 1, 80, per, year, in, the, us, and, by, 1, 47, in, the, uk, thus, a, difference, in, gdp, growth, by, only, a, few, tenths, of, a, percent, per, year, results, in, large, differences, in, outcomes, when, the, growth, is, persistent, over, a, generation, this, and, other, observations, have, led, some, economists, to, view, gdp, growth, as, the, most, important, part, of, the, field, of, macroeconomics, if, we, can, learn, about, government, policy, options, that, have, even, small, effects, on, long, term, growth, rates, we, can, contribute, much, more, to, improvements, in, standards, of, living, than, has, been, provided, by, the, entire, history, of, macroeconomic, analysis, of, countercyclical, policy, and, fine, tuning, economic, growth, the, part, of, macroeconomics, that, really, matters, it, has, been, observed, that, gdp, growth, is, influenced, by, the, size, of, the, economy, the, relation, between, gdp, growth, and, gdp, across, the, countries, at, a, particular, point, of, time, is, convex, growth, increases, as, gdp, reaches, its, maximum, and, then, begins, to, decline, there, exists, some, extremum, value, this, is, not, exactly, middle, income, trap, it, is, observed, for, both, developed, and, developing, economies, actually, countries, having, this, property, belong, to, conventional, growth, domain, however, the, extremum, could, be, extended, by, technological, and, policy, innovations, and, some, countries, move, into, innovative, growth, domain, with, higher, limiting, values, in, national, income, accounting, per, capita, output, can, be, calculated, using, the, following, factors, output, per, unit, of, labor, input, labor, productivity, hours, worked, intensity, the, percentage, of, the, working, age, population, actually, working, participation, rate, and, the, proportion, of, the, working, age, population, to, the, total, population, demographics, the, rate, of, change, of, gdp, population, is, the, sum, of, the, rates, of, change, of, these, four, variables, plus, their, cross, products, economists, distinguish, between, long, run, economic, growth, and, short, run, economic, changes, in, production, short, run, variation, in, economic, growth, is, termed, the, business, cycle, generally, according, to, economists, the, ups, and, downs, in, the, business, cycle, can, be, attributed, to, fluctuations, in, aggregate, demand, in, contrast, economic, growth, is, concerned, with, the, long, run, trend, in, production, due, to, structural, causes, such, as, technological, growth, and, factor, accumulation, increases, in, labor, productivity, the, ratio, of, the, value, of, output, to, labor, input, have, historically, been, the, most, important, source, of, real, per, capita, economic, growth, in, a, famous, estimate, mit, professor, robert, solow, concluded, that, technological, progress, has, accounted, for, 80, percent, of, the, long, term, rise, in, u, s, per, capita, income, with, increased, investment, in, capital, explaining, only, the, remaining, 20, percent, increases, in, productivity, lower, the, real, cost, of, goods, over, the, 20th, century, the, real, price, of, many, goods, fell, by, over, 90, economic, growth, has, traditionally, been, attributed, to, the, accumulation, of, human, and, physical, capital, and, the, increase, in, productivity, and, creation, of, new, goods, arising, from, technological, innovation, further, division, of, labour, specialization, is, also, fundamental, to, rising, productivity, before, industrialization, technological, progress, resulted, in, an, increase, in, the, population, which, was, kept, in, check, by, food, supply, and, other, resources, which, acted, to, limit, per, capita, income, a, condition, known, as, the, malthusian, trap, the, rapid, economic, growth, that, occurred, during, the, industrial, revolution, was, remarkable, because, it, was, in, excess, of, population, growth, providing, an, escape, from, the, malthusian, trap, countries, that, industrialized, eventually, saw, their, population, growth, slow, down, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, demographic, transition, increases, in, productivity, are, the, major, factor, responsible, for, per, capita, economic, growth, this, has, been, especially, evident, since, the, mid, 19th, century, most, of, the, economic, growth, in, the, 20th, century, was, due, to, increased, output, per, unit, of, labor, materials, energy, and, land, less, input, per, widget, the, balance, of, the, growth, in, output, has, come, from, using, more, inputs, both, of, these, changes, increase, output, the, increased, output, included, more, of, the, same, goods, produced, previously, and, new, goods, and, services, during, the, industrial, revolution, mechanization, began, to, replace, hand, methods, in, manufacturing, and, new, processes, streamlined, production, of, chemicals, iron, steel, and, other, products, machine, tools, made, the, economical, production, of, metal, parts, possible, so, that, parts, could, be, interchangeable, see, interchangeable, parts, during, the, second, industrial, revolution, a, major, factor, of, productivity, growth, was, the, substitution, of, inanimate, power, for, human, and, animal, labor, also, there, was, a, great, increase, in, power, as, steam, powered, electricity, generation, and, internal, combustion, supplanted, limited, wind, and, water, power, since, that, replacement, the, great, expansion, of, total, power, was, driven, by, continuous, improvements, in, energy, conversion, efficiency, other, major, historical, sources, of, productivity, were, automation, transportation, infrastructures, canals, railroads, and, highways, new, materials, steel, and, power, which, includes, steam, and, internal, combustion, engines, and, electricity, other, productivity, improvements, included, mechanized, agriculture, and, scientific, agriculture, including, chemical, fertilizers, and, livestock, and, poultry, management, and, the, green, revolution, interchangeable, parts, made, with, machine, tools, powered, by, electric, motors, evolved, into, mass, production, which, is, universally, used, today, great, sources, of, productivity, improvement, in, the, late, 19th, century, were, railroads, steam, ships, horse, pulled, reapers, and, combine, harvesters, and, steam, powered, factories, the, invention, of, processes, for, making, cheap, steel, were, important, for, many, forms, of, mechanization, and, transportation, by, the, late, 19th, century, both, prices, and, weekly, work, hours, fell, because, less, labor, materials, and, energy, were, required, to, produce, and, transport, goods, however, real, wages, rose, allowing, workers, to, improve, their, diet, buy, consumer, goods, and, afford, better, housing, mass, production, of, the, 1920s, created, overproduction, which, was, arguably, one, of, several, causes, of, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, following, the, great, depression, economic, growth, resumed, aided, in, part, by, increased, demand, for, existing, goods, and, services, such, as, automobiles, telephones, radios, electricity, and, household, appliances, new, goods, and, services, included, television, air, conditioning, and, commercial, aviation, after, 1950, creating, enough, new, demand, to, stabilize, the, work, week, the, building, of, highway, infrastructures, also, contributed, to, post, world, war, ii, growth, as, did, capital, investments, in, manufacturing, and, chemical, industries, the, post, world, war, ii, economy, also, benefited, from, the, discovery, of, vast, amounts, of, oil, around, the, world, particularly, in, the, middle, east, by, john, w, kendrick, s, estimate, three, quarters, of, increase, in, u, s, per, capita, gdp, from, 1889, to, 1957, was, due, to, increased, productivity, economic, growth, in, the, united, states, slowed, down, after, 1973, in, contrast, growth, in, asia, has, been, strong, since, then, starting, with, japan, and, spreading, to, four, asian, tigers, china, southeast, asia, the, indian, subcontinent, and, asia, pacific, in, 1957, south, korea, had, a, lower, per, capita, gdp, than, ghana, and, by, 2008, it, was, 17, times, as, high, as, ghana, s, the, japanese, economic, growth, has, slackened, considerably, since, the, late, 1980s, productivity, in, the, united, states, grew, at, an, increasing, rate, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, was, most, rapid, in, the, early, to, middle, decades, of, the, 20th, century, u, s, productivity, growth, spiked, towards, the, end, of, the, century, in, 1996, 2004, due, to, an, acceleration, in, the, rate, of, technological, innovation, known, as, moore, s, law, after, 2004, u, s, productivity, growth, returned, to, the, low, levels, of, 1972, 96, capital, in, economics, ordinarily, refers, to, physical, capital, which, consists, of, structures, largest, component, of, physical, capital, and, equipment, used, in, business, machinery, factory, equipment, computers, and, office, equipment, construction, equipment, business, vehicles, medical, equipment, etc, up, to, a, point, increases, in, the, amount, of, capital, per, worker, are, an, important, cause, of, economic, output, growth, capital, is, subject, to, diminishing, returns, because, of, the, amount, that, can, be, effectively, invested, and, because, of, the, growing, burden, of, depreciation, in, the, development, of, economic, theory, the, distribution, of, income, was, considered, to, be, between, labor, and, the, owners, of, land, and, capital, in, recent, decades, there, have, been, several, asian, countries, with, high, rates, of, economic, growth, driven, by, capital, investment, the, work, week, declined, considerably, over, the, 19th, century, by, the, 1920s, the, average, work, week, in, the, u, s, was, 49, hours, but, the, work, week, was, reduced, to, 40, hours, after, which, overtime, premium, was, applied, as, part, of, the, national, industrial, recovery, act, of, 1933, demographic, factors, may, influence, growth, by, changing, the, employment, to, population, ratio, and, the, labor, force, participation, rate, industrialization, creates, a, demographic, transition, in, which, birth, rates, decline, and, the, average, age, of, the, population, increases, women, with, fewer, children, and, better, access, to, market, employment, tend, to, join, the, labor, force, in, higher, percentages, there, is, a, reduced, demand, for, child, labor, and, children, spend, more, years, in, school, the, increase, in, the, percentage, of, women, in, the, labor, force, in, the, u, s, contributed, to, economic, growth, as, did, the, entrance, of, the, baby, boomers, into, the, workforce, see, spending, wave, many, theoretical, and, empirical, analyses, of, economic, growth, attribute, a, major, role, to, a, country, s, level, of, human, capital, defined, as, the, skills, of, the, population, or, the, work, force, human, capital, has, been, included, in, both, neoclassical, and, endogenous, growth, models, a, country, s, level, of, human, capital, is, difficult, to, measure, since, it, is, created, at, home, at, school, and, on, the, job, economists, have, attempted, to, measure, human, capital, using, numerous, proxies, including, the, population, s, level, of, literacy, its, level, of, numeracy, its, level, of, book, production, capita, its, average, level, of, formal, schooling, its, average, test, score, on, international, tests, and, its, cumulative, depreciated, investment, in, formal, schooling, the, most, commonly, used, measure, of, human, capital, is, the, level, average, years, of, school, attainment, in, a, country, building, upon, the, data, development, of, robert, barro, and, jong, wha, lee, this, measure, is, widely, used, because, barro, and, lee, provide, data, for, numerous, countries, in, five, year, intervals, for, a, long, period, of, time, one, problem, with, the, schooling, attainment, measure, is, that, the, amount, of, human, capital, acquired, in, a, year, of, schooling, is, not, the, same, at, all, levels, of, schooling, and, is, not, the, same, in, all, countries, this, measure, also, presumes, that, human, capital, is, only, developed, in, formal, schooling, contrary, to, the, extensive, evidence, that, families, neighborhoods, peers, and, health, also, contribute, to, the, development, of, human, capital, despite, these, potential, limitations, theodore, breton, has, shown, that, this, measure, can, represent, human, capital, in, log, linear, growth, models, because, across, countries, gdp, adult, has, a, log, linear, relationship, to, average, years, of, schooling, which, is, consistent, with, the, log, linear, relationship, between, workers, personal, incomes, and, years, of, schooling, in, the, mincer, model, eric, hanushek, and, dennis, kimko, introduced, measures, of, students, mathematics, and, science, skills, from, international, assessments, into, growth, analysis, they, found, that, this, measure, of, human, capital, was, very, significantly, related, to, economic, growth, eric, hanushek, and, ludger, w, mann, have, extended, this, analysis, theodore, breton, shows, that, the, correlation, between, economic, growth, and, students, average, test, scores, in, hanushek, and, w, mann, s, analyses, is, actually, due, to, the, relationship, in, countries, with, less, than, eight, years, of, schooling, he, shows, that, economic, growth, is, not, correlated, with, average, scores, in, more, educated, countries, hanushek, and, w, mann, further, investigate, whether, the, relationship, of, knowledge, capital, to, economic, growth, is, causal, they, show, that, the, level, of, students, cognitive, skills, can, explain, the, slow, growth, in, latin, america, and, the, rapid, growth, in, east, asia, joerg, baten, and, jan, luiten, van, zanden, employ, book, production, per, capita, as, a, proxy, for, sophisticated, literacy, capabilities, and, find, that, countries, with, high, levels, of, human, capital, formation, in, the, 18th, century, initiated, or, participated, in, the, industrialization, process, of, the, 19th, century, whereas, countries, with, low, levels, of, human, capital, formation, were, unable, to, do, so, among, them, many, of, today, s, less, developed, countries, such, as, india, indonesia, and, china, here, health, is, approached, as, a, functioning, from, amartya, sen, and, martha, nussbaum, s, capability, approach, that, an, individual, has, to, realise, the, achievements, like, economic, success, thus, health, in, a, broader, sense, is, not, the, absence, of, illness, but, the, opportunity, for, people, to, biologically, develop, to, their, full, potential, their, entire, lives, it, is, established, that, human, capital, is, an, important, asset, for, economic, growth, however, it, can, only, be, so, if, that, population, is, healthy, and, well, nourished, one, of, the, most, important, aspects, of, health, is, the, mortality, rate, and, how, the, rise, or, decline, can, affect, the, labour, supply, predominant, in, a, developing, economy, mortality, decline, triggers, greater, investments, in, individual, human, capital, and, an, increase, in, economic, growth, matteo, cervellati, and, uwe, sunde, and, rodrigo, r, soares, consider, frameworks, in, which, mortality, decline, has, an, influence, on, parents, to, have, fewer, children, and, to, provide, quality, education, for, those, children, as, a, result, instituting, an, economic, demographic, transition, the, relationship, between, health, and, economic, growth, is, further, nuanced, by, distinguishing, the, influence, of, specific, diseases, on, gdp, per, capita, from, that, of, aggregate, measures, of, health, such, as, life, expectancy, thus, investing, in, health, is, warranted, both, from, the, growth, and, equity, perspectives, given, the, important, role, played, by, health, in, the, economy, protecting, health, assets, from, the, impact, of, systemic, transitional, costs, on, economic, reforms, pandemics, economic, crises, and, natural, disasters, is, also, crucial, protection, from, the, shocks, produced, by, illness, and, death, are, usually, taken, care, of, within, a, country, s, social, insurance, system, in, areas, such, as, sub, saharan, africa, where, the, prevalence, of, hiv, and, aids, has, a, comparative, negative, impact, on, economical, development, it, will, be, interesting, to, see, how, research, in, the, areas, of, health, in, near, future, uncover, how, the, world, will, be, performing, living, with, the, sars, cov, 2, especially, looking, at, the, economic, impacts, it, already, has, in, a, space, of, two, years, ultimately, when, people, live, longer, on, average, human, capital, expenditures, are, more, likely, to, pay, off, and, all, of, these, mechanisms, center, around, the, complementarity, of, longevity, health, and, education, for, which, there, is, ample, empirical, evidence, as, institutions, influence, behavior, and, incentives, in, real, life, they, forge, the, success, or, failure, of, nations, in, economics, and, economic, history, the, transition, from, earlier, economic, systems, to, capitalism, was, facilitated, by, the, adoption, of, government, policies, which, fostered, commerce, and, gave, individuals, more, personal, and, economic, freedom, these, included, new, laws, favorable, to, the, establishment, of, business, including, contract, law, laws, providing, for, the, protection, of, private, property, and, the, abolishment, of, anti, usury, laws, much, of, the, literature, on, economic, growth, refers, to, the, success, story, of, the, british, state, after, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, in, which, high, fiscal, capacity, combined, with, constraints, on, the, power, of, the, king, generated, some, respect, for, the, rule, of, law, however, others, have, questioned, that, this, institutional, formula, is, not, so, easily, replicable, elsewhere, as, a, change, in, the, constitution, and, the, type, of, institutions, created, by, that, change, does, not, necessarily, create, a, change, in, political, power, if, the, economic, powers, of, that, society, are, not, aligned, with, the, new, set, of, rule, of, law, institutions, in, england, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, state, s, fiscal, capacity, followed, the, creation, of, constraints, on, the, crown, but, elsewhere, in, europe, increases, in, state, capacity, happened, before, major, rule, of, law, reforms, there, are, many, different, ways, through, which, states, achieved, state, fiscal, capacity, and, this, different, capacity, accelerated, or, hindered, their, economic, development, thanks, to, the, underlying, homogeneity, of, its, land, and, people, england, was, able, to, achieve, a, unified, legal, and, fiscal, system, since, the, middle, ages, that, enabled, it, to, substantially, increase, the, taxes, it, raised, after, 1689, on, the, other, hand, the, french, experience, of, state, building, faced, much, stronger, resistance, from, local, feudal, powers, keeping, it, legally, and, fiscally, fragmented, until, the, french, revolution, despite, significant, increases, in, state, capacity, during, the, seventeenth, century, furthermore, prussia, and, the, habsburg, empire, much, more, heterogeneous, states, than, england, were, able, to, increase, state, capacity, during, the, eighteenth, century, without, constraining, the, powers, of, the, executive, nevertheless, it, is, unlikely, that, a, country, will, generate, institutions, that, respect, property, rights, and, the, rule, of, law, without, having, had, first, intermediate, fiscal, and, political, institutions, that, create, incentives, for, elites, to, support, them, many, of, these, intermediate, level, institutions, relied, on, informal, private, order, arrangements, that, combined, with, public, order, institutions, associated, with, states, to, lay, the, foundations, of, modern, rule, of, law, states, in, many, poor, and, developing, countries, much, land, and, housing, are, held, outside, the, formal, or, legal, property, ownership, registration, system, in, many, urban, areas, the, poor, invade, private, or, government, land, to, build, their, houses, so, they, do, not, hold, title, to, these, properties, much, unregistered, property, is, held, in, informal, form, through, various, property, associations, and, other, arrangements, reasons, for, extra, legal, ownership, include, excessive, bureaucratic, red, tape, in, buying, property, and, building, in, some, countries, it, can, take, over, 200, steps, and, up, to, 14, years, to, build, on, government, land, other, causes, of, extra, legal, property, are, failures, to, notarize, transaction, documents, or, having, documents, notarized, but, failing, to, have, them, recorded, with, the, official, agency, not, having, clear, legal, title, to, property, limits, its, potential, to, be, used, as, collateral, to, secure, loans, depriving, many, poor, countries, of, one, of, their, most, important, potential, sources, of, capital, unregistered, businesses, and, lack, of, accepted, accounting, methods, are, other, factors, that, limit, potential, capital, businesses, and, individuals, participating, in, unreported, business, activity, and, owners, of, unregistered, property, face, costs, such, as, bribes, and, pay, offs, that, offset, much, of, any, taxes, avoided, democracy, does, cause, growth, according, to, acemoglu, et, al, specifically, they, state, that, democracy, increases, future, gdp, by, encouraging, investment, increasing, schooling, inducing, economic, reforms, improving, public, goods, provision, and, reducing, social, unrest, unesco, and, the, united, nations, also, consider, that, cultural, property, protection, high, quality, education, cultural, diversity, and, social, cohesion, in, armed, conflicts, are, particularly, necessary, for, qualitative, growth, according, to, daron, acemoglu, simon, johnson, and, james, robinson, the, positive, correlation, between, high, income, and, cold, climate, is, a, by, product, of, history, europeans, adopted, very, different, colonization, policies, in, different, colonies, with, different, associated, institutions, in, places, where, these, colonizers, faced, high, mortality, rates, e, g, due, to, the, presence, of, tropical, diseases, they, could, not, settle, permanently, and, they, were, thus, more, likely, to, establish, extractive, institutions, which, persisted, after, independence, in, places, where, they, could, settle, permanently, e, g, those, with, temperate, climates, they, established, institutions, with, this, objective, in, mind, and, modeled, them, after, those, in, their, european, homelands, in, these, neo, europes, better, institutions, in, turn, produced, better, development, outcomes, thus, although, other, economists, focus, on, the, identity, or, type, of, legal, system, of, the, colonizers, to, explain, institutions, these, authors, look, at, the, environmental, conditions, in, the, colonies, to, explain, institutions, for, instance, former, colonies, have, inherited, corrupt, governments, and, geopolitical, boundaries, set, by, the, colonizers, that, are, not, properly, placed, regarding, the, geographical, locations, of, different, ethnic, groups, creating, internal, disputes, and, conflicts, that, hinder, development, in, another, example, societies, that, emerged, in, colonies, without, solid, native, populations, established, better, property, rights, and, incentives, for, long, term, investment, than, those, where, native, populations, were, large, in, why, nations, fail, acemoglu, and, robinson, said, that, the, english, in, north, america, started, by, trying, to, repeat, the, success, of, the, spanish, conquistadors, in, extracting, wealth, especially, gold, and, silver, from, the, countries, they, had, conquered, this, system, repeatedly, failed, for, the, english, their, successes, rested, on, giving, land, and, a, voice, in, the, government, to, every, male, settler, to, incentivize, productive, labor, in, virginia, it, took, twelve, years, and, many, deaths, from, starvation, before, the, governor, decided, to, try, democracy, economic, growth, its, sustainability, and, its, distribution, remain, central, aspects, of, government, policy, for, example, the, uk, government, recognises, that, government, can, play, an, important, role, in, supporting, economic, growth, by, helping, to, level, the, playing, field, through, the, way, it, buys, public, goods, works, and, services, and, post, pandemic, economic, growth, has, been, featured, in, a, series, of, inquiries, undertaken, by, the, parliamentary, business, energy, and, industrial, strategy, committee, which, argues, that, the, uk, government, has, a, big, job, to, do, in, helping, businesses, survive, stimulating, economic, growth, and, encouraging, the, creation, of, well, paid, meaningful, jobs, policymakers, and, scholars, frequently, emphasize, the, importance, of, entrepreneurship, for, economic, growth, however, surprisingly, few, research, empirically, examine, and, quantify, entrepreneurship, s, impact, on, growth, this, is, due, to, endogeneity, forces, that, drive, economic, growth, also, drive, entrepreneurship, in, other, words, the, empirical, analysis, of, the, impact, of, entrepreneurship, on, growth, is, difficult, because, of, the, joint, determination, of, entrepreneurship, and, economic, growth, a, few, papers, use, quasi, experimental, designs, and, have, found, that, entrepreneurship, and, the, density, of, small, businesses, indeed, have, a, causal, impact, on, regional, growth, another, major, cause, of, economic, growth, is, the, introduction, of, new, products, and, services, and, the, improvement, of, existing, products, new, products, create, demand, which, is, necessary, to, offset, the, decline, in, employment, that, occurs, through, labor, saving, technology, and, to, a, lesser, extent, employment, declines, due, to, savings, in, energy, and, materials, in, the, u, s, by, 2013, about, 60, of, consumer, spending, was, for, goods, and, services, that, did, not, exist, in, 1869, also, the, creation, of, new, services, has, been, more, important, than, invention, of, new, goods, economic, growth, in, the, u, s, and, other, developed, countries, went, through, phases, that, affected, growth, through, changes, in, the, labor, force, participation, rate, and, the, relative, sizes, of, economic, sectors, the, transition, from, an, agricultural, economy, to, manufacturing, increased, the, size, of, the, sector, with, high, output, per, hour, the, high, productivity, manufacturing, sector, while, reducing, the, size, of, the, sector, with, lower, output, per, hour, the, lower, productivity, agricultural, sector, eventually, high, productivity, growth, in, manufacturing, reduced, the, sector, size, as, prices, fell, and, employment, shrank, relative, to, other, sectors, the, service, and, government, sectors, where, output, per, hour, and, productivity, growth, is, low, saw, increases, in, their, shares, of, the, economy, and, employment, during, the, 1990s, the, public, sector, has, since, contracted, while, the, service, economy, expanded, in, the, 2000s, the, structural, change, could, also, be, viewed, from, another, angle, it, is, possible, to, divide, real, economic, growth, into, two, components, an, indicator, of, extensive, economic, growth, the, quantitative, gdp, and, an, indicator, of, the, improvement, of, the, quality, of, goods, and, services, the, qualitative, gdp, adam, smith, pioneered, modern, economic, growth, and, performance, theory, in, his, book, the, wealth, of, nations, first, published, in, 1776, for, smith, the, main, factors, of, economic, growth, are, division, of, labour, and, capital, accumulation, however, these, are, conditioned, by, what, he, calls, the, extent, of, the, market, this, is, conditioned, notably, by, geographic, factors, but, also, institutional, ones, such, as, the, political, legal, environment, malthusianism, is, the, idea, that, population, growth, is, potentially, exponential, while, the, growth, of, the, food, supply, or, other, resources, is, linear, which, eventually, reduces, living, standards, to, the, point, of, triggering, a, population, die, off, the, malthusian, theory, also, proposes, that, over, most, of, human, history, technological, progress, caused, larger, population, growth, but, had, no, impact, on, income, per, capita, in, the, long, run, according, to, the, theory, while, technologically, advanced, economies, over, this, epoch, were, characterized, by, higher, population, density, their, level, of, income, per, capita, was, not, different, from, those, among, technologically, regressed, society, the, conceptual, foundations, of, the, malthusian, theory, were, formed, by, thomas, malthus, and, a, modern, representation, of, these, approach, is, provided, by, ashraf, and, galor, in, line, with, the, predictions, of, the, malthusian, theory, a, cross, country, analysis, finds, a, significant, positive, effect, of, the, technological, level, on, population, density, and, an, insignificant, effect, on, income, per, capita, significantly, over, the, years, 1, 1500, in, classical, ricardian, economics, the, theory, of, production, and, the, theory, of, growth, are, based, on, the, theory, of, sustainability, and, law, of, variable, proportions, whereby, increasing, either, of, the, factors, of, production, labor, or, capital, while, holding, the, other, constant, and, assuming, no, technological, change, will, increase, output, but, at, a, diminishing, rate, that, eventually, will, approach, zero, these, concepts, have, their, origins, in, thomas, malthus, s, theorizing, about, agriculture, malthus, s, examples, included, the, number, of, seeds, harvested, relative, to, the, number, of, seeds, planted, capital, on, a, plot, of, land, and, the, size, of, the, harvest, from, a, plot, of, land, versus, the, number, of, workers, employed, see, also, diminishing, returns, criticisms, of, classical, growth, theory, are, that, technology, an, important, factor, in, economic, growth, is, held, constant, and, that, economies, of, scale, are, ignored, one, popular, theory, in, the, 1940s, was, the, big, push, model, which, suggested, that, countries, needed, to, jump, from, one, stage, of, development, to, another, through, a, virtuous, cycle, in, which, large, investments, in, infrastructure, and, education, coupled, with, private, investments, would, move, the, economy, to, a, more, productive, stage, breaking, free, from, economic, paradigms, appropriate, to, a, lower, productivity, stage, the, idea, was, revived, and, formulated, rigorously, in, the, late, 1980s, by, kevin, murphy, andrei, shleifer, and, robert, vishny, robert, solow, and, trevor, swan, developed, what, eventually, became, the, main, model, used, in, growth, economics, in, the, 1950s, this, model, assumes, that, there, are, diminishing, returns, to, capital, and, labor, capital, accumulates, through, investment, but, its, level, or, stock, continually, decreases, due, to, depreciation, due, to, the, diminishing, returns, to, capital, with, increases, in, capital, worker, and, absent, technological, progress, economic, output, worker, eventually, reaches, a, point, where, capital, per, worker, and, economic, output, worker, remain, constant, because, annual, investment, in, capital, equals, annual, depreciation, this, condition, is, called, the, steady, state, in, the, solow, swan, model, if, productivity, increases, through, technological, progress, then, output, worker, increases, even, when, the, economy, is, in, the, steady, state, if, productivity, increases, at, a, constant, rate, output, worker, also, increases, at, a, related, steady, state, rate, as, a, consequence, growth, in, the, model, can, occur, either, by, increasing, the, share, of, gdp, invested, or, through, technological, progress, but, at, whatever, share, of, gdp, invested, capital, worker, eventually, converges, on, the, steady, state, leaving, the, growth, rate, of, output, worker, determined, only, by, the, rate, of, technological, progress, as, a, consequence, with, world, technology, available, to, all, and, progressing, at, a, constant, rate, all, countries, have, the, same, steady, state, rate, of, growth, each, country, has, a, different, level, of, gdp, worker, determined, by, the, share, of, gdp, it, invests, but, all, countries, have, the, same, rate, of, economic, growth, implicitly, in, this, model, rich, countries, are, those, that, have, invested, a, high, share, of, gdp, for, a, long, time, poor, countries, can, become, rich, by, increasing, the, share, of, gdp, they, invest, one, important, prediction, of, the, model, mostly, borne, out, by, the, data, is, that, of, conditional, convergence, the, idea, that, poor, countries, will, grow, faster, and, catch, up, with, rich, countries, as, long, as, they, have, similar, investment, and, saving, rates, and, access, to, the, same, technology, the, solow, swan, model, is, considered, an, exogenous, growth, model, because, it, does, not, explain, why, countries, invest, different, shares, of, gdp, in, capital, nor, why, technology, improves, over, time, instead, the, rate, of, investment, and, the, rate, of, technological, progress, are, exogenous, the, value, of, the, model, is, that, it, predicts, the, pattern, of, economic, growth, once, these, two, rates, are, specified, its, failure, to, explain, the, determinants, of, these, rates, is, one, of, its, limitations, although, the, rate, of, investment, in, the, model, is, exogenous, under, certain, conditions, the, model, implicitly, predicts, convergence, in, the, rates, of, investment, across, countries, in, a, global, economy, with, a, global, financial, capital, market, financial, capital, flows, to, the, countries, with, the, highest, return, on, investment, in, the, solow, swan, model, countries, with, less, capital, worker, poor, countries, have, a, higher, return, on, investment, due, to, the, diminishing, returns, to, capital, as, a, consequence, capital, worker, and, output, worker, in, a, global, financial, capital, market, should, converge, to, the, same, level, in, all, countries, since, historically, financial, capital, has, not, flowed, to, the, countries, with, less, capital, worker, the, basic, solow, swan, model, has, a, conceptual, flaw, beginning, in, the, 1990s, this, flaw, has, been, addressed, by, adding, additional, variables, to, the, model, that, can, explain, why, some, countries, are, less, productive, than, others, and, therefore, do, not, attract, flows, of, global, financial, capital, even, though, they, have, less, physical, capital, worker, in, practice, convergence, was, rarely, achieved, in, 1957, solow, applied, his, model, to, data, from, the, u, s, gross, national, product, to, estimate, contributions, this, showed, that, the, increase, in, capital, and, labor, stock, only, accounted, for, about, half, of, the, output, while, the, population, increase, adjustments, to, capital, explained, eighth, this, remaining, unaccounted, growth, output, is, known, as, the, solow, residual, here, the, a, of, t, technical, progress, was, the, reason, for, increased, output, nevertheless, the, model, still, had, flaws, it, gave, no, room, for, policy, to, influence, the, growth, rate, few, attempts, were, also, made, by, the, rand, corporation, the, non, profit, think, tank, and, frequently, visiting, economist, kenneth, arrow, to, work, out, the, kinks, in, the, model, they, suggested, that, new, knowledge, was, indivisible, and, that, it, is, endogenous, with, a, certain, fixed, cost, arrow, s, further, explained, that, new, knowledge, obtained, by, firms, comes, from, practice, and, built, a, model, that, knowledge, accumulated, through, experience, according, to, harrod, the, natural, growth, rate, is, the, maximum, rate, of, growth, allowed, by, the, increase, of, variables, like, population, growth, technological, improvement, and, growth, in, natural, resources, in, fact, the, natural, growth, rate, is, the, highest, attainable, growth, rate, which, would, bring, about, the, fullest, possible, employment, of, the, resources, existing, in, the, economy, unsatisfied, with, the, assumption, of, exogenous, technological, progress, in, the, solow, swan, model, economists, worked, to, endogenize, i, e, explain, it, from, within, the, models, productivity, growth, in, the, 1980s, the, resulting, endogenous, growth, theory, most, notably, advanced, by, robert, lucas, jr, and, his, student, paul, romer, includes, a, mathematical, explanation, of, technological, advancement, this, model, was, notable, for, its, incorporation, of, human, capital, which, is, interpreted, from, changes, to, investment, patterns, in, education, training, and, healthcare, by, private, sector, firms, or, governments, notwithstanding, the, implications, this, component, has, for, policy, the, endogenous, perspective, on, human, capital, investment, emphasizes, the, possibility, for, broad, based, effects, which, can, be, realized, by, other, firms, in, the, economy, accordingly, human, capital, is, theorized, to, deliver, increasing, rates, of, return, unlike, physical, capital, research, done, in, this, area, has, focused, on, what, increases, human, capital, e, g, education, or, technological, change, e, g, innovation, the, quantity, theory, of, endogenous, productivity, growth, was, proposed, by, russian, economist, vladimir, pokrovskii, it, explains, growth, as, a, consequence, of, the, dynamics, of, three, factors, including, the, technological, characteristics, of, production, equipment, without, any, arbitrary, parameters, historical, rates, of, economic, growth, can, be, predicted, with, considerable, precision, on, memorial, day, weekend, in, 1988, a, conference, in, buffalo, brought, together, influential, thinkers, to, evaluate, the, conflicting, theories, of, growth, romer, krugman, barro, and, becker, were, in, attendance, along, with, many, other, high, profiled, economists, of, the, time, amongst, many, papers, that, day, the, one, that, stood, out, was, romer, s, micro, foundations, for, aggregate, technological, change, the, micro, foundation, claimed, that, endogenous, technological, change, had, the, concept, of, intellectual, property, imbedded, and, that, knowledge, is, an, input, and, output, of, production, romer, argued, that, outcomes, to, the, national, growth, rates, were, significantly, affected, by, public, policy, trade, activity, and, intellectual, property, he, stressed, that, cumulative, capital, and, specialization, were, key, and, that, not, only, population, growth, can, increase, capital, of, knowledge, it, was, human, capital, that, is, specifically, trained, in, harvesting, new, ideas, while, intellectual, property, may, be, important, baker, 2016, cites, multiple, sources, claiming, that, stronger, patent, protection, seems, to, be, associated, with, slower, growth, that, s, particularly, true, for, patents, in, the, ethical, health, care, industry, in, effect, taxpayers, pay, twice, for, new, drugs, and, diagnostic, procedures, first, in, tax, subsidies, and, second, for, the, high, prices, of, diagnostic, procedures, treatments, if, the, results, of, research, paid, by, taxpayers, were, placed, in, the, public, domain, baker, claims, that, people, everywhere, would, be, healthier, because, better, diagnoses, and, treatment, would, be, more, affordable, the, world, over, one, branch, of, endogenous, growth, theory, was, developed, on, the, foundations, of, the, schumpeterian, theory, named, after, the, 20th, century, austrian, economist, joseph, schumpeter, the, approach, explains, growth, as, a, consequence, of, innovation, and, a, process, of, creative, destruction, that, captures, the, dual, nature, of, technological, progress, in, terms, of, creation, entrepreneurs, introduce, new, products, or, processes, in, the, hope, that, they, will, enjoy, temporary, monopoly, like, profits, as, they, capture, markets, in, doing, so, they, make, old, technologies, or, products, obsolete, this, can, be, seen, as, an, annulment, of, previous, technologies, which, makes, them, obsolete, and, destroys, the, rents, generated, by, previous, innovations, 855, a, major, model, that, illustrates, schumpeterian, growth, is, the, aghion, howitt, model, unified, growth, theory, was, developed, by, oded, galor, and, his, co, authors, to, address, the, inability, of, endogenous, growth, theory, to, explain, key, empirical, regularities, in, the, growth, processes, of, individual, economies, and, the, world, economy, as, a, whole, unlike, endogenous, growth, theory, that, focuses, entirely, on, the, modern, growth, regime, and, is, therefore, unable, to, explain, the, roots, of, inequality, across, nations, unified, growth, theory, captures, in, a, single, framework, the, fundamental, phases, of, the, process, of, development, in, the, course, of, human, history, i, the, malthusian, epoch, that, was, prevalent, over, most, of, human, history, ii, the, escape, from, the, malthusian, trap, iii, the, emergence, of, human, capital, as, a, central, element, in, the, growth, process, iv, the, onset, of, the, fertility, decline, v, the, origins, of, the, modern, era, of, sustained, economic, growth, and, vi, the, roots, of, divergence, in, income, per, capita, across, nations, in, the, past, two, centuries, the, theory, suggests, that, during, most, of, human, existence, technological, progress, was, offset, by, population, growth, and, living, standards, were, near, subsistence, across, time, and, space, however, the, reinforcing, interaction, between, the, rate, of, technological, progress, and, the, size, and, composition, of, the, population, has, gradually, increased, the, pace, of, technological, progress, enhancing, the, importance, of, education, in, the, ability, of, individuals, to, adapt, to, the, changing, technological, environment, the, rise, in, the, allocation, of, resources, towards, education, triggered, a, fertility, decline, enabling, economies, to, allocate, a, larger, share, of, the, fruits, of, technological, progress, to, a, steady, increase, in, income, per, capita, rather, than, towards, the, growth, of, population, paving, the, way, for, the, emergence, of, sustained, economic, growth, the, theory, further, suggests, that, variations, in, biogeographical, characteristics, as, well, as, cultural, and, institutional, characteristics, have, generated, a, differential, pace, of, transition, from, stagnation, to, growth, across, countries, and, consequently, divergence, in, their, income, per, capita, over, the, past, two, centuries, the, prevailing, views, about, the, role, of, inequality, in, the, growth, process, has, radically, shifted, in, the, past, century, the, classical, perspective, as, expressed, by, adam, smith, and, others, suggests, that, inequality, fosters, the, growth, process, specifically, since, the, aggregate, saving, increases, with, inequality, due, to, higher, property, to, save, among, the, wealthy, the, classical, viewpoint, suggests, that, inequality, stimulates, capital, accumulation, and, therefore, economic, growth, the, neoclassical, perspective, that, is, based, on, representative, agent, approach, denies, the, role, of, inequality, in, the, growth, process, it, suggests, that, while, the, growth, process, may, affect, inequality, income, distribution, has, no, impact, on, the, growth, process, the, modern, perspective, which, has, emerged, in, the, late, 1980s, suggests, in, contrast, that, income, distribution, has, a, significant, impact, on, the, growth, process, the, modern, perspective, originated, by, galor, and, zeira, highlights, the, important, role, of, heterogeneity, in, the, determination, of, aggregate, economic, activity, and, economic, growth, in, particular, galor, and, zeira, argue, that, since, credit, markets, are, imperfect, inequality, has, an, enduring, impact, on, human, capital, formation, the, level, of, income, per, capita, and, the, growth, process, in, contrast, to, the, classical, paradigm, which, underlined, the, positive, implications, of, inequality, for, capital, formation, and, economic, growth, galor, and, zeira, argue, that, inequality, has, an, adverse, effect, on, human, capital, formation, and, the, development, process, in, all, but, the, very, poor, economies, later, theoretical, developments, have, reinforced, the, view, that, inequality, has, an, adverse, effect, on, the, growth, process, specifically, alesina, and, rodrik, and, persson, and, tabellini, advance, a, political, economy, mechanism, and, argue, that, inequality, has, a, negative, impact, on, economic, development, since, it, creates, a, pressure, for, distortionary, redistributive, policies, that, have, an, adverse, effect, on, investment, and, economic, growth, in, accordance, with, the, credit, market, imperfection, approach, a, study, by, roberto, perotti, showed, that, inequality, is, associated, with, lower, level, of, human, capital, formation, education, experience, apprenticeship, and, higher, level, of, fertility, while, lower, level, of, human, capital, is, associated, with, lower, growth, and, lower, levels, of, economic, growth, in, contrast, his, examination, of, the, political, economy, channel, found, no, support, for, the, political, economy, mechanism, consequently, the, political, economy, perspective, on, the, relationship, between, inequality, and, growth, have, been, revised, and, later, studies, have, established, that, inequality, may, provide, an, incentive, for, the, elite, to, block, redistributive, policies, and, institutional, changes, in, particular, inequality, in, the, distribution, of, land, ownership, provides, the, landed, elite, with, an, incentive, to, limit, the, mobility, of, rural, workers, by, depriving, them, from, education, and, by, blocking, the, development, of, the, industrial, sector, a, unified, theory, of, inequality, and, growth, that, captures, that, changing, role, of, inequality, in, the, growth, process, offers, a, reconciliation, between, the, conflicting, predictions, of, classical, viewpoint, that, maintained, that, inequality, is, beneficial, for, growth, and, the, modern, viewpoint, that, suggests, that, in, the, presence, of, credit, market, imperfections, inequality, predominantly, results, in, underinvestment, in, human, capital, and, lower, economic, growth, this, unified, theory, of, inequality, and, growth, developed, by, oded, galor, and, omer, moav, suggests, that, the, effect, of, inequality, on, the, growth, process, has, been, reversed, as, human, capital, has, replaced, physical, capital, as, the, main, engine, of, economic, growth, in, the, initial, phases, of, industrialization, when, physical, capital, accumulation, was, the, dominating, source, of, economic, growth, inequality, boosted, the, development, process, by, directing, resources, toward, individuals, with, higher, propensity, to, save, however, in, later, phases, as, human, capital, become, the, main, engine, of, economic, growth, more, equal, distribution, of, income, in, the, presence, of, credit, constraints, stimulated, investment, in, human, capital, and, economic, growth, in, 2013, french, economist, thomas, piketty, postulated, that, in, periods, when, the, average, annual, rate, on, return, on, investment, in, capital, r, exceeds, the, average, annual, growth, in, economic, output, g, the, rate, of, inequality, will, increase, according, to, piketty, this, is, the, case, because, wealth, that, is, already, held, or, inherited, which, is, expected, to, grow, at, the, rate, r, will, grow, at, a, rate, faster, than, wealth, accumulated, through, labor, which, is, more, closely, tied, to, g, an, advocate, of, reducing, inequality, levels, piketty, suggests, levying, a, global, wealth, tax, in, order, to, reduce, the, divergence, in, wealth, caused, by, inequality, the, reduced, form, empirical, relationship, between, inequality, and, growth, was, studied, by, alberto, alesina, and, dani, rodrik, and, torsten, persson, and, guido, tabellini, they, find, that, inequality, is, negatively, associated, with, economic, growth, in, a, cross, country, analysis, robert, barro, reexamined, the, reduced, form, relationship, between, inequality, on, economic, growth, in, a, panel, of, countries, he, argues, that, there, is, little, overall, relation, between, income, inequality, and, rates, of, growth, and, investment, however, his, empirical, strategy, limits, its, applicability, to, the, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, inequality, and, growth, for, several, reasons, first, his, regression, analysis, control, for, education, fertility, investment, and, it, therefore, excludes, by, construction, the, important, effect, of, inequality, on, growth, via, education, fertility, and, investment, his, findings, simply, imply, that, inequality, has, no, direct, effect, on, growth, beyond, the, important, indirect, effects, through, the, main, channels, proposed, in, the, literature, second, his, study, analyzes, the, effect, of, inequality, on, the, average, growth, rate, in, the, following, 10, years, however, existing, theories, suggest, that, the, effect, of, inequality, will, be, observed, much, later, as, is, the, case, in, human, capital, formation, for, instance, third, the, empirical, analysis, does, not, account, for, biases, that, are, generated, by, reverse, causality, and, omitted, variables, recent, papers, based, on, superior, data, find, negative, relationship, between, inequality, and, growth, andrew, berg, and, jonathan, ostry, of, the, international, monetary, fund, find, that, lower, net, inequality, is, robustly, correlated, with, faster, and, more, durable, growth, controlling, for, the, level, of, redistribution, likewise, dierk, herzer, and, sebastian, vollmer, find, that, increased, income, inequality, reduces, economic, growth, the, galor, and, zeira, s, model, predicts, that, the, effect, of, rising, inequality, on, gdp, per, capita, is, negative, in, relatively, rich, countries, but, positive, in, poor, countries, these, testable, predictions, have, been, examined, and, confirmed, empirically, in, recent, studies, in, particular, br, ckner, and, lederman, test, the, prediction, of, the, model, by, in, the, panel, of, countries, during, the, period, 1970, 2010, by, considering, the, impact, of, the, interaction, between, the, level, of, income, inequality, and, the, initial, level, of, gdp, per, capita, in, line, with, the, predictions, of, the, model, they, find, that, at, the, 25th, percentile, of, initial, income, in, the, world, sample, a, 1, percentage, point, increase, in, the, gini, coefficient, increases, income, per, capita, by, 2, 3, whereas, at, the, 75th, percentile, of, initial, income, a, 1, percentage, point, increase, in, the, gini, coefficient, decreases, income, per, capita, by, 5, 3, moreover, the, proposed, human, capital, mechanism, that, mediates, the, effect, of, inequality, on, growth, in, the, galor, zeira, model, is, also, confirmed, increases, in, income, inequality, increase, human, capital, in, poor, countries, but, reduce, it, in, high, and, middle, income, countries, this, recent, support, for, the, predictions, of, the, galor, zeira, model, is, in, line, with, earlier, findings, roberto, perotti, showed, that, in, accordance, with, the, credit, market, imperfection, approach, developed, by, galor, and, zeira, inequality, is, associated, with, lower, level, of, human, capital, formation, education, experience, apprenticeship, and, higher, level, of, fertility, while, lower, level, of, human, capital, is, associated, with, lower, levels, of, economic, growth, princeton, economist, roland, benabou, s, finds, that, the, growth, process, of, korea, and, the, philippines, are, broadly, consistent, with, the, credit, constrained, human, capital, accumulation, hypothesis, in, addition, andrew, berg, and, jonathan, ostry, suggest, that, inequality, seems, to, affect, growth, through, human, capital, accumulation, and, fertility, channels, in, contrast, perotti, argues, that, the, political, economy, mechanism, is, not, supported, empirically, inequality, is, associated, with, lower, redistribution, and, lower, redistribution, under, investment, in, education, and, infrastructure, is, associated, with, lower, economic, growth, over, long, periods, of, time, even, small, rates, of, growth, such, as, a, 2, annual, increase, have, large, effects, for, example, the, united, kingdom, experienced, a, 1, 97, average, annual, increase, in, its, inflation, adjusted, gdp, between, 1830, and, 2008, in, 1830, the, gdp, was, 41, 373, million, pounds, it, grew, to, 1, 330, 088, million, pounds, by, 2008, a, growth, rate, that, averaged, 1, 97, over, 178, years, resulted, in, a, 32, fold, increase, in, gdp, by, 2008, the, large, impact, of, a, relatively, small, growth, rate, over, a, long, period, of, time, is, due, to, the, power, of, exponential, growth, the, rule, of, 72, a, mathematical, result, states, that, if, something, grows, at, the, rate, of, x, per, year, then, its, level, will, double, every, 72, x, years, for, example, a, growth, rate, of, 2, 5, per, annum, leads, to, a, doubling, of, the, gdp, within, 28, 8, years, whilst, a, growth, rate, of, 8, per, year, leads, to, a, doubling, of, gdp, within, nine, years, thus, a, small, difference, in, economic, growth, rates, between, countries, can, result, in, very, different, standards, of, living, for, their, populations, if, this, small, difference, continues, for, many, years, one, theory, that, relates, economic, growth, with, quality, of, life, is, the, threshold, hypothesis, which, states, that, economic, growth, up, to, a, point, brings, with, it, an, increase, in, quality, of, life, but, at, that, point, called, the, threshold, point, further, economic, growth, can, bring, with, it, a, deterioration, in, quality, of, life, this, results, in, an, upside, down, u, shaped, curve, where, the, vertex, of, the, curve, represents, the, level, of, growth, that, should, be, targeted, happiness, has, been, shown, to, increase, with, gdp, per, capita, at, least, up, to, a, level, of, 15, 000, per, person, economic, growth, has, the, indirect, potential, to, alleviate, poverty, as, a, result, of, a, simultaneous, increase, in, employment, opportunities, and, increased, labor, productivity, a, study, by, researchers, at, the, overseas, development, institute, odi, of, 24, countries, that, experienced, growth, found, that, in, 18, cases, poverty, was, alleviated, in, some, instances, quality, of, life, factors, such, as, healthcare, outcomes, and, educational, attainment, as, well, as, social, and, political, liberties, do, not, improve, as, economic, growth, occurs, productivity, increases, do, not, always, lead, to, increased, wages, as, can, be, seen, in, the, united, states, where, the, gap, between, productivity, and, wages, has, been, rising, since, the, 1980s, while, acknowledging, the, central, role, economic, growth, can, potentially, play, in, human, development, poverty, reduction, and, the, achievement, of, the, millennium, development, goals, it, is, becoming, widely, understood, amongst, the, development, community, that, special, efforts, must, be, made, to, ensure, poorer, sections, of, society, are, able, to, participate, in, economic, growth, the, effect, of, economic, growth, on, poverty, reduction, the, growth, elasticity, of, poverty, can, depend, on, the, existing, level, of, inequality, for, instance, with, low, inequality, a, country, with, a, growth, rate, of, 2, per, head, and, 40, of, its, population, living, in, poverty, can, halve, poverty, in, ten, years, but, a, country, with, high, inequality, would, take, nearly, 60, years, to, achieve, the, same, reduction, in, the, words, of, the, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, ban, ki, moon, while, economic, growth, is, necessary, it, is, not, sufficient, for, progress, on, reducing, poverty, critics, such, as, the, club, of, rome, argue, that, a, narrow, view, of, economic, growth, combined, with, globalization, is, creating, a, scenario, where, we, could, see, a, systemic, collapse, of, our, planet, s, natural, resources, concerns, about, negative, environmental, effects, of, growth, have, prompted, some, people, to, advocate, lower, levels, of, growth, or, the, abandoning, of, growth, altogether, in, academia, concepts, like, uneconomic, growth, steady, state, economy, eco, taxes, green, investments, basic, income, guarantees, along, with, more, radical, approaches, associated, with, degrowth, commoning, eco, socialism, and, eco, anarchism, have, been, developed, in, order, to, achieve, this, and, to, overcome, possible, growth, imperatives, in, politics, green, parties, embrace, the, global, greens, charter, recognising, that, the, dogma, of, economic, growth, at, any, cost, and, the, excessive, and, wasteful, use, of, natural, resources, without, considering, earth, s, carrying, capacity, are, causing, extreme, deterioration, in, the, environment, and, a, massive, extinction, of, species, 2, the, 2019, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, published, by, the, united, nations, intergovernmental, science, policy, platform, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, warned, that, given, the, substantial, loss, of, biodiversity, society, should, not, focus, solely, on, economic, growth, anthropologist, eduardo, s, brondizio, one, of, the, co, chairs, of, the, report, said, we, need, to, change, our, narratives, both, our, individual, narratives, that, associate, wasteful, consumption, with, quality, of, life, and, with, status, and, the, narratives, of, the, economic, systems, that, still, consider, that, environmental, degradation, and, social, inequality, are, inevitable, outcomes, of, economic, growth, economic, growth, is, a, means, and, not, an, end, we, need, to, look, for, the, quality, of, life, of, the, planet, those, more, optimistic, about, the, environmental, impacts, of, growth, believe, that, though, localized, environmental, effects, may, occur, large, scale, ecological, effects, are, minor, the, argument, as, posited, by, commentator, julian, lincoln, simon, stated, in, 1981, that, if, these, global, scale, ecological, effects, exist, human, ingenuity, will, find, ways, to, adapt, to, them, conversely, partha, dasgupta, in, a, 2021, report, on, the, economics, of, biodiversity, commissioned, by, the, british, treasury, argued, that, biodiversity, is, collapsing, faster, than, at, any, time, in, human, history, as, a, result, of, the, demands, of, contemporary, human, civilization, which, far, exceed, nature, s, capacity, to, supply, us, with, the, goods, and, services, we, all, rely, on, we, would, require, 1, 6, earths, to, maintain, the, world, s, current, living, standards, he, says, that, major, transformative, changes, will, be, needed, akin, to, or, even, greater, than, those, of, the, marshall, plan, including, abandoning, gdp, as, a, measure, of, economic, success, and, societal, progress, philip, cafaro, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, school, of, global, environmental, sustainability, at, colorado, state, university, wrote, in, 2022, that, a, scientific, consensus, has, emerged, which, demonstrates, that, humanity, is, on, the, precipice, of, unleashing, a, major, extinction, event, and, that, the, cause, of, global, biodiversity, loss, is, clear, other, species, are, being, displaced, by, a, rapidly, growing, human, economy, in, 2019, a, warning, on, climate, change, signed, by, 11, 000, scientists, from, over, 150, nations, said, economic, growth, is, the, driving, force, behind, the, excessive, extraction, of, materials, and, overexploitation, of, ecosystems, and, that, this, must, be, quickly, curtailed, to, maintain, long, term, sustainability, of, the, biosphere, they, add, that, our, goals, need, to, shift, from, gdp, growth, and, the, pursuit, of, affluence, toward, sustaining, ecosystems, and, improving, human, well, being, by, prioritizing, basic, needs, and, reducing, inequality, a, 2021, paper, authored, by, top, scientists, in, frontiers, in, conservation, science, posited, that, given, the, environmental, crises, including, biodiversity, loss, and, climate, change, and, possible, ghastly, future, facing, humanity, there, must, be, fundamental, changes, to, global, capitalism, including, the, abolition, of, perpetual, economic, growth, up, to, the, present, there, is, a, close, correlation, between, economic, growth, and, the, rate, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, across, nations, although, there, is, also, a, considerable, divergence, in, carbon, intensity, carbon, emissions, per, gdp, up, to, the, present, there, is, also, a, direct, relation, between, global, economic, wealth, and, the, rate, of, global, emissions, the, stern, review, notes, that, the, prediction, that, under, business, as, usual, global, emissions, will, be, sufficient, to, propel, greenhouse, gas, concentrations, to, over, 550, ppm, co, 2, by, 2050, and, over, 650, 700, ppm, by, the, end, of, this, century, is, robust, to, a, wide, range, of, changes, in, model, assumptions, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, planetary, ecosystem, functioning, without, incurring, dangerous, risks, requires, stabilization, at, 450, 550, ppm, as, a, consequence, growth, oriented, environmental, economists, propose, government, intervention, into, switching, sources, of, energy, production, favouring, wind, solar, hydroelectric, and, nuclear, this, would, largely, confine, use, of, fossil, fuels, to, either, domestic, cooking, needs, such, as, for, kerosene, burners, or, where, carbon, capture, and, storage, technology, can, be, cost, effective, and, reliable, the, stern, review, published, by, the, united, kingdom, government, in, 2006, concluded, that, an, investment, of, 1, of, gdp, later, changed, to, 2, would, be, sufficient, to, avoid, the, worst, effects, of, climate, change, and, that, failure, to, do, so, could, risk, climate, related, costs, equal, to, 20, of, gdp, because, carbon, capture, and, storage, are, as, yet, widely, unproven, and, its, long, term, effectiveness, such, as, in, containing, carbon, dioxide, leaks, unknown, and, because, of, current, costs, of, alternative, fuels, these, policy, responses, largely, rest, on, faith, of, technological, change, british, conservative, politician, and, journalist, nigel, lawson, has, deemed, carbon, emission, trading, an, inefficient, system, of, rationing, instead, he, favours, carbon, taxes, to, make, full, use, of, the, efficiency, of, the, market, however, in, order, to, avoid, the, migration, of, energy, intensive, industries, the, whole, world, should, impose, such, a, tax, not, just, britain, lawson, pointed, out, there, is, no, point, in, taking, the, lead, if, nobody, follows, suit, many, earlier, predictions, of, resource, depletion, such, as, thomas, malthus, 1798, predictions, about, approaching, famines, in, europe, the, population, bomb, and, the, simon, ehrlich, wager, 1980, have, not, materialized, diminished, production, of, most, resources, has, not, occurred, so, far, one, reason, being, that, advancements, in, technology, and, science, have, allowed, some, previously, unavailable, resources, to, be, produced, in, some, cases, substitution, of, more, abundant, materials, such, as, plastics, for, cast, metals, lowered, growth, of, usage, for, some, metals, in, the, case, of, the, limited, resource, of, land, famine, was, relieved, firstly, by, the, revolution, in, transportation, caused, by, railroads, and, steam, ships, and, later, by, the, green, revolution, and, chemical, fertilizers, especially, the, haber, process, for, ammonia, synthesis, resource, quality, is, composed, of, a, variety, of, factors, including, ore, grades, location, altitude, above, or, below, sea, level, proximity, to, railroads, highways, water, supply, and, climate, these, factors, affect, the, capital, and, operating, cost, of, extracting, resources, in, the, case, of, minerals, lower, grades, of, mineral, resources, are, being, extracted, requiring, higher, inputs, of, capital, and, energy, for, both, extraction, and, processing, copper, ore, grades, have, declined, significantly, over, the, last, century, another, example, is, natural, gas, from, shale, and, other, low, permeability, rock, whose, extraction, requires, much, higher, inputs, of, energy, capital, and, materials, than, conventional, gas, in, previous, decades, offshore, oil, and, gas, have, exponentially, increased, cost, as, water, depth, increases, some, physical, scientists, like, sanyam, mittal, regard, continuous, economic, growth, as, unsustainable, several, factors, may, constrain, economic, growth, for, example, finite, peaked, or, depleted, resources, in, 1972, the, limits, to, growth, study, modeled, limitations, to, infinite, growth, originally, ridiculed, some, of, the, predicted, trends, have, materialized, raising, concerns, of, an, impending, collapse, or, decline, due, to, resource, constraints, malthusians, such, as, william, r, catton, jr, are, skeptical, of, technological, advances, that, improve, resource, availability, such, advances, and, increases, in, efficiency, they, suggest, merely, accelerate, the, drawing, down, of, finite, resources, catton, claims, that, increasing, rates, of, resource, extraction, are, stealing, ravenously, from, the, future, energy, economic, theories, hold, that, rates, of, energy, consumption, and, energy, efficiency, are, linked, causally, to, economic, growth, the, garrett, relation, holds, that, there, has, been, a, fixed, relationship, between, current, rates, of, global, energy, consumption, and, the, historical, accumulation, of, world, gdp, independent, of, the, year, considered, it, follows, that, economic, growth, as, represented, by, gdp, growth, requires, higher, rates, of, energy, consumption, growth, seemingly, paradoxically, these, are, sustained, through, increases, in, energy, efficiency, increases, in, energy, efficiency, were, a, portion, of, the, increase, in, total, factor, productivity, some, of, the, most, technologically, important, innovations, in, history, involved, increases, in, energy, efficiency, these, include, the, great, improvements, in, efficiency, of, conversion, of, heat, to, work, the, reuse, of, heat, the, reduction, in, friction, and, the, transmission, of, power, especially, through, electrification, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, per, capita, electricity, consumption, and, economic, development, top, country,
