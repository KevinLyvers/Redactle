societies, for, example, in, some, societies, children, enter, at, an, earlier, age, than, in, others, in, some, societies, a, tradition, has, developed, in, which, families, send, their, children, to, the, same, boarding, school, for, generations, one, observation, that, appears, to, apply, globally, is, that, a, significantly, larger, number, of, boys, than, girls, attend, boarding, school, and, for, a, longer, span, of, time, the, practice, of, sending, children, particularly, boys, to, other, families, or, to, schools, so, that, they, could, learn, together, is, of, very, long, standing, recorded, in, classical, literature, and, in, uk, records, going, back, over, 1, 000, years, in, europe, a, practice, developed, by, early, medieval, times, of, sending, boys, to, be, taught, by, literate, clergymen, either, in, monasteries, or, as, pages, in, great, households, the, king, s, school, canterbury, arguably, the, world, s, oldest, boarding, school, dates, its, foundation, from, the, development, of, the, monastery, school, in, around, 597, ad, the, author, of, the, croyland, chronicle, recalls, being, tested, on, his, grammar, by, edward, the, confessor, s, wife, queen, editha, in, the, abbey, cloisters, as, a, westminster, schoolboy, in, around, the, 1050s, monastic, schools, as, such, were, generally, dissolved, with, the, monasteries, themselves, under, henry, viii, although, westminster, school, was, specifically, preserved, by, the, king, s, letters, patent, and, it, seems, likely, that, most, schools, were, immediately, replaced, winchester, college, founded, by, bishop, william, of, wykeham, in, 1382, and, oswestry, school, founded, by, david, holbache, in, 1407, are, the, oldest, boarding, schools, in, continuous, operation, boarding, schools, in, britain, started, in, medieval, times, when, boys, were, sent, to, be, educated, by, literate, clerics, at, a, monastery, or, noble, household, in, the, 12th, century, the, pope, ordered, all, benedictine, monasteries, such, as, westminster, to, provide, charity, schools, and, many, public, schools, started, when, such, schools, attracted, paying, students, these, public, schools, reflected, the, collegiate, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, as, in, many, ways, they, still, do, and, were, accordingly, staffed, almost, entirely, by, clergymen, until, the, 19th, century, private, tuition, at, home, remained, the, norm, for, aristocratic, families, and, for, girls, in, particular, but, after, the, 16th, century, it, was, increasingly, accepted, that, adolescents, of, any, rank, might, best, be, educated, collectively, the, institution, has, thus, adapted, itself, to, changing, social, circumstances, over, 1, 000, years, boarding, preparatory, schools, tend, to, reflect, the, public, schools, they, feed, they, often, have, a, more, or, less, official, tie, to, particular, schools, the, classic, british, boarding, school, became, highly, popular, during, the, colonial, expansion, of, the, british, empire, british, colonial, administrators, abroad, could, ensure, that, their, children, were, brought, up, in, british, culture, at, public, schools, at, home, in, the, uk, and, local, rulers, were, offered, the, same, education, for, their, sons, more, junior, expatriates, would, send, their, children, to, local, british, run, schools, which, would, also, admit, selected, local, children, who, might, travel, from, considerable, distances, the, boarding, schools, which, inculcated, their, own, values, became, an, effective, way, to, encourage, local, people, to, share, british, ideals, and, so, help, the, british, achieve, their, imperial, goals, one, of, the, reasons, sometimes, stated, for, sending, children, to, boarding, schools, is, to, develop, wider, horizons, than, their, family, can, provide, a, boarding, school, a, family, has, attended, for, generations, may, define, the, culture, parents, aspire, to, for, their, children, equally, by, choosing, a, fashionable, boarding, school, parents, may, aspire, to, better, their, children, by, enabling, them, to, mix, on, equal, terms, with, children, of, the, upper, classes, however, such, stated, reasons, may, conceal, other, reasons, for, sending, a, child, away, from, home, these, might, apply, to, children, who, are, considered, too, disobedient, or, underachieving, children, from, families, with, divorced, spouses, and, children, to, whom, the, parents, do, not, much, relate, these, reasons, are, rarely, explicitly, stated, though, the, child, might, be, aware, of, them, in, 1998, there, were, 772, private, sector, boarding, schools, in, the, united, kingdom, with, over, 100, 000, children, attending, them, all, across, the, country, they, are, an, important, factor, in, the, british, class, system, about, one, percent, of, british, children, are, sent, to, boarding, schools, also, in, britain, children, as, young, as, 5, to, 9, years, of, age, are, sent, to, boarding, schools, in, the, united, states, boarding, schools, for, students, below, the, age, of, 13, are, called, junior, boarding, schools, and, are, relatively, uncommon, the, oldest, junior, boarding, school, is, the, fay, school, in, southborough, massachusetts, established, in, 1866, other, boarding, schools, are, intended, for, high, school, age, students, generally, of, ages, 14, 18, some, of, the, oldest, of, these, boarding, schools, include, west, nottingham, academy, est, 1744, linden, hall, school, est, 1756, the, governor, s, academy, est, 1763, phillips, academy, andover, est, 1778, and, phillips, exeter, academy, est, 1781, boarding, schools, for, this, age, group, are, often, referred, to, as, prep, schools, about, half, of, one, percent, or, 5, of, school, children, attend, boarding, schools, about, half, the, percentage, of, british, children, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, united, states, government, undertook, a, policy, of, educating, native, american, youth, in, the, ways, of, the, dominant, western, culture, so, that, native, americans, might, then, be, able, to, assimilate, into, western, society, at, these, boarding, schools, managed, and, regulated, by, the, government, native, american, students, were, subjected, to, a, number, of, tactics, to, prepare, them, for, life, outside, their, reservation, homes, in, accordance, with, the, assimilation, methods, used, at, the, boarding, schools, the, education, that, the, native, american, children, received, at, these, institutions, centered, on, the, dominant, society, s, construction, of, gender, norms, and, ideals, thus, boys, and, girls, were, separated, in, almost, every, activity, and, their, interactions, were, strictly, regulated, along, the, lines, of, victorian, ideals, in, addition, the, instruction, that, the, children, received, reflected, the, roles, and, duties, that, they, were, to, assume, once, outside, the, reservation, thus, girls, were, taught, skills, that, could, be, used, in, the, home, such, as, sewing, cooking, canning, ironing, child, care, and, cleaning, adams, 150, native, american, boys, in, the, boarding, schools, were, taught, the, importance, of, an, agricultural, lifestyle, with, an, emphasis, on, raising, livestock, and, agricultural, skills, like, plowing, and, planting, field, irrigation, the, care, of, stock, and, the, maintenance, of, fruit, orchards, adams, 149, these, ideas, of, domesticity, were, in, stark, contrast, to, those, existing, in, native, communities, and, on, reservations, many, indigenous, societies, were, based, on, a, matrilineal, system, where, the, women, s, lineage, was, honored, and, the, women, s, place, in, society, respected, in, different, ways, for, example, women, in, native, society, held, powerful, roles, in, their, own, communities, undertaking, tasks, that, western, society, deemed, only, appropriate, for, men, indigenous, women, could, be, leaders, healers, and, farmers, while, the, native, american, children, were, exposed, to, and, were, likely, to, adopt, some, of, the, ideals, set, out, by, the, whites, operating, these, boarding, schools, many, resisted, and, rejected, the, gender, norms, that, were, being, imposed, upon, them, in, canada, the, largest, independent, boarding, school,
