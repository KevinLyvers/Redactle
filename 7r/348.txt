in, a, writing, system, a, letter, is, a, grapheme, that, generally, corresponds, to, a, phoneme, the, smallest, functional, unit, of, speech, though, there, is, rarely, total, one, to, one, correspondence, between, the, two, an, alphabet, is, a, writing, system, that, uses, letters, a, letter, is, a, type, of, grapheme, the, smallest, functional, unit, within, a, writing, system, letters, are, graphemes, that, broadly, correspond, to, phonemes, the, smallest, functional, units, of, sound, in, speech, similarly, to, how, phonemes, are, combined, to, form, spoken, words, letters, may, be, combined, to, form, written, words, a, single, phoneme, may, also, be, represented, by, multiple, letters, in, sequence, collectively, called, a, multigraph, multigraphs, include, digraphs, of, two, letters, e, g, english, ch, sh, th, and, trigraphs, of, three, letters, e, g, english, tch, the, same, letterform, may, be, used, in, different, alphabets, while, representing, different, phonemic, categories, the, latin, h, greek, eta, and, cyrillic, en, are, homoglyphs, but, represent, different, phonemes, conversely, the, distinct, forms, of, s, the, greek, sigma, and, cyrillic, es, each, represent, analogous, s, phonemes, letters, are, associated, with, specific, names, which, may, differ, between, languages, and, dialects, z, for, example, is, usually, called, zed, outside, of, the, united, states, where, it, is, named, zee, both, ultimately, derive, from, the, name, of, the, parent, greek, letter, zeta, in, alphabets, letters, are, arranged, in, alphabetical, order, which, also, may, vary, by, language, in, spanish, is, considered, to, be, a, separate, letter, from, n, though, this, distinction, is, not, usually, recognised, in, english, dictionaries, in, computer, systems, each, has, its, own, code, point, u, 006e, n, latin, small, letter, n, and, u, 00f1, latin, small, letter, n, with, tilde, respectively, letters, may, also, function, as, numerals, with, assigned, numerical, values, for, example, with, roman, numerals, greek, and, latin, letters, have, a, variety, of, modern, uses, in, mathematics, science, and, engineering, people, and, objects, are, sometimes, named, after, letters, for, one, of, these, reasons, the, word, letter, entered, middle, english, c, 1200, borrowed, from, the, old, french, letre, it, eventually, displaced, the, previous, old, english, term, b, cst, f, bookstaff, letter, ultimately, descends, from, the, latin, littera, which, may, have, been, derived, from, the, greek, diphthera, writing, tablet, via, etruscan, until, the, 19th, century, letter, was, also, used, interchangeably, to, refer, to, a, speech, segment, before, alphabets, phonograms, graphic, symbols, of, sounds, were, used, there, were, three, kinds, of, phonograms, verbal, pictures, for, entire, words, syllabic, which, stood, for, articulations, of, words, and, alphabetic, which, represented, signs, or, letters, the, earliest, examples, of, which, are, from, ancient, egypt, and, ancient, china, dating, to, c, 3000, bce, the, first, consonantal, alphabet, emerged, around, c, 1800, bce, representing, the, phoenicians, semitic, workers, in, egypt, their, script, was, originally, written, and, read, from, right, to, left, from, the, phoenician, alphabet, came, the, etruscan, and, greek, alphabets, from, there, the, most, widely, used, alphabet, today, emerged, latin, which, is, written, and, read, from, left, to, right, the, phoenician, alphabet, had, 22, letters, nineteen, of, which, the, latin, alphabet, used, and, the, greek, alphabet, adapted, c, 900, bce, added, four, letters, to, those, used, in, phoenician, this, greek, alphabet, was, the, first, to, assign, letters, not, only, to, consonant, sounds, but, also, to, vowels, the, roman, empire, further, developed, and, refined, the, latin, alphabet, beginning, around, 500, bce, during, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, the, development, of, lowercase, letters, began, to, emerge, in, roman, writing, at, this, point, paragraphs, uppercase, and, lowercase, letters, and, the, concept, of, sentences, and, clauses, still, had, not, emerged, these, final, bits, of, development, emerged, in, the, late, 7th, and, early, 8th, centuries, finally, many, slight, letter, additions, and, drops, were, made, to, the, common, alphabet, used, in, the, western, world, minor, changes, were, made, such, as, the, removal, of, certain, letters, such, as, thorn, wynn, and, eth, a, letter, can, have, multiple, variants, or, allographs, related, to, variation, in, style, of, handwriting, or, printing, some, writing, systems, have, two, major, types, of, allographs, for, each, letter, an, uppercase, form, also, called, capital, or, majuscule, and, a, lowercase, form, also, called, minuscule, upper, and, lowercase, letters, represent, the, same, sound, but, serve, different, functions, in, writing, capital, letters, are, most, often, used, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, as, the, first, letter, of, a, proper, name, or, title, or, in, headers, or, inscriptions, they, may, also, serve, other, functions, such, as, in, the, german, language, where, all, nouns, begin, with, capital, letters, the, terms, uppercase, and, lowercase, originated, in, the, days, of, handset, type, for, printing, presses, individual, letter, blocks, were, kept, in, specific, compartments, of, drawers, in, a, type, case, capital, letters, were, stored, in, a, higher, drawer, or, upper, case, in, most, alphabetic, scripts, diacritics, or, accents, are, a, routinely, used, english, is, unusual, in, not, using, them, except, for, loanwords, from, other, languages, or, personal, names, for, example, na, ve, bront, the, ubiquity, of, this, usage, is, indicated, by, the, existence, of, precomposed, characters, for, use, with, computer, systems, for, example, in, the, following, table, letters, from, multiple, different, writing, systems, are, shown, to, demonstrate, the, variety, of, letters, used, throughout, the, world
