a, state, is, a, political, entity, that, regulates, society, and, the, population, within, a, territory, government, is, considered, to, form, the, fundamental, apparatus, of, contemporary, states, a, country, often, has, a, single, state, with, various, administrative, divisions, a, state, may, be, a, unitary, state, or, a, some, type, of, federal, union, in, the, latter, type, the, term, state, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, federated, polities, that, make, up, the, federation, and, they, may, have, some, of, the, attributes, of, a, sovereign, state, except, being, under, their, federation, and, without, the, same, capacity, to, act, internationally, other, terms, that, are, used, in, such, federal, systems, may, include, province, region, or, other, terms, for, most, of, prehistory, people, lived, in, stateless, societies, the, earliest, forms, of, states, arose, about, 5, 500, years, ago, over, time, societies, became, more, stratified, and, developed, institutions, leading, to, centralised, governments, these, gained, state, capacity, in, conjunction, with, the, growth, of, cities, which, was, often, dependent, on, climate, and, economic, development, with, centralisation, often, spurred, on, by, insecurity, and, territorial, competition, over, time, a, variety, of, forms, of, states, developed, which, used, many, different, justifications, for, their, existence, such, as, divine, right, the, theory, of, the, social, contract, etc, today, the, modern, nation, state, is, the, predominant, form, of, state, to, which, people, are, subject, sovereign, states, have, sovereignty, any, ingroup, s, claim, to, have, a, state, faces, some, practical, limits, via, the, degree, to, which, other, states, recognize, them, as, such, definitions, of, a, state, are, disputed, according, to, sociologist, max, weber, a, state, is, a, polity, that, maintains, a, monopoly, on, the, legitimate, use, of, violence, although, other, definitions, are, common, absence, of, a, state, does, not, preclude, the, existence, of, a, society, such, as, stateless, societies, like, the, haudenosaunee, confederacy, that, do, not, have, either, purely, or, even, primarily, political, institutions, or, roles, the, degree, and, extent, of, governance, of, a, state, is, used, to, determine, whether, it, has, failed, the, word, state, and, its, cognates, in, some, other, european, languages, stato, in, italian, estado, in, spanish, and, portuguese, tat, in, french, staat, in, german, and, dutch, ultimately, derive, from, the, latin, word, status, meaning, condition, circumstances, latin, status, derives, from, stare, to, stand, or, remain, or, be, permanent, thus, providing, the, sacred, or, magical, connotation, of, the, political, entity, the, english, noun, state, in, the, generic, sense, condition, circumstances, predates, the, political, sense, it, was, introduced, to, middle, english, c, 1200, both, from, old, french, and, directly, from, latin, with, the, revival, of, the, roman, law, in, 14th, century, europe, the, term, came, to, refer, to, the, legal, standing, of, persons, such, as, the, various, estates, of, the, realm, noble, common, and, clerical, and, in, particular, the, special, status, of, the, king, the, highest, estates, generally, those, with, the, most, wealth, and, social, rank, were, those, that, held, power, the, word, also, had, associations, with, roman, ideas, dating, back, to, cicero, about, the, status, rei, publicae, the, condition, of, public, matters, in, time, the, word, lost, its, reference, to, particular, social, groups, and, became, associated, with, the, legal, order, of, the, entire, society, and, the, apparatus, of, its, enforcement, the, early, 16th, century, works, of, machiavelli, especially, the, prince, played, a, central, role, in, popularizing, the, use, of, the, word, state, in, something, similar, to, its, modern, sense, the, contrasting, of, church, and, state, still, dates, to, the, 16th, century, the, north, american, colonies, were, called, states, as, early, as, the, 1630s, the, expression, l, tat, c, est, moi, i, am, the, state, attributed, to, louis, xiv, although, probably, apocryphal, is, recorded, in, the, late, 18th, century, there, is, no, academic, consensus, on, the, definition, of, the, state, the, term, state, refers, to, a, set, of, different, but, interrelated, and, often, overlapping, theories, about, a, certain, range, of, political, phenomena, according, to, walter, scheidel, mainstream, definitions, of, the, state, have, the, following, in, common, centralized, institutions, that, impose, rules, and, back, them, up, by, force, over, a, territorially, circumscribed, population, a, distinction, between, the, rulers, and, the, ruled, and, an, element, of, autonomy, stability, and, differentiation, these, distinguish, the, state, from, less, stable, forms, of, organization, such, as, the, exercise, of, chiefly, power, the, most, commonly, used, definition, is, by, max, weber, who, describes, the, state, as, a, compulsory, political, organization, with, a, centralized, government, that, maintains, a, monopoly, of, the, legitimate, use, of, force, within, a, certain, territory, weber, writes, that, the, state, is, a, human, community, that, successfully, claims, the, monopoly, of, the, legitimate, use, of, physical, force, within, a, given, territory, while, defining, a, state, it, is, important, not, to, confuse, it, with, a, nation, an, error, that, occurs, frequently, in, common, discussion, a, state, refers, to, a, political, unit, with, sovereignty, over, a, given, territory, while, a, state, is, more, of, a, political, legal, abstraction, the, definition, of, a, nation, is, more, concerned, with, political, identity, and, cultural, or, historical, factors, importantly, nations, do, not, possess, the, organizational, characteristics, like, geographic, boundaries, or, authority, figures, and, officials, that, states, do, additionally, a, nation, does, not, have, a, claim, to, a, monopoly, on, the, legitimate, use, of, force, over, their, populace, while, a, state, does, as, weber, indicated, an, example, of, the, instability, that, arises, when, a, state, does, not, have, a, monopoly, on, the, use, of, force, can, be, seen, in, african, states, which, remain, weak, due, to, the, lack, of, war, which, european, states, relied, on, a, state, should, not, be, confused, with, a, government, a, government, is, an, organization, that, has, been, granted, the, authority, to, act, on, the, behalf, of, a, state, nor, should, a, state, be, confused, with, a, society, a, society, refers, to, all, organized, groups, movements, and, individuals, who, are, independent, of, the, state, and, seek, to, remain, out, of, its, influence, neuberger, offers, a, slightly, different, definition, of, the, state, with, respect, to, the, nation, the, state, is, a, primordial, essential, and, permanent, expression, of, the, genius, of, a, specific, the, definition, of, a, state, is, also, dependent, on, how, and, why, they, form, the, contractarian, view, of, the, state, suggests, that, states, form, because, people, can, all, benefit, from, cooperation, with, others, and, that, without, a, state, there, would, be, chaos, the, contractarian, view, focuses, more, on, the, alignment, and, conflict, of, interests, between, individuals, in, a, state, on, the, other, hand, the, predatory, view, of, the, state, focuses, on, the, potential, mismatch, between, the, interests, of, the, people, and, interests, of, the, state, charles, tilly, goes, so, far, to, say, that, states, resemble, a, form, of, organized, crime, and, should, be, viewed, as, extortion, rackets, he, argued, that, the, state, sells, protection, from, itself, and, raises, the, question, about, why, people, should, trust, a, state, when, they, cannot, trust, one, another, tilly, defines, states, as, coercion, wielding, organisations, that, are, distinct, from, households, and, kinship, groups, and, exercise, clear, priority, in, some, respects, over, all, other, organizations, within, substantial, territories, tilly, includes, city, states, theocracies, and, empires, in, his, definition, along, with, nation, states, but, excludes, tribes, lineages, firms, and, churches, according, to, tilly, states, can, be, seen, in, the, archaeological, record, as, of, 6000, bc, in, europe, they, appeared, around, 990, but, became, particularly, prominent, after, 1490, tilly, defines, a, state, s, essential, minimal, activities, as, importantly, tilly, makes, the, case, that, war, is, an, essential, part, of, state, making, that, wars, create, states, and, vice, versa, modern, academic, definitions, of, the, state, frequently, include, the, criterion, that, a, state, has, to, be, recognized, as, such, by, the, international, community, liberal, thought, provides, another, possible, teleology, of, the, state, according, to, john, locke, the, goal, of, the, state, or, commonwealth, is, the, preservation, of, property, second, treatise, on, government, with, property, in, locke, s, work, referring, not, only, to, personal, possessions, but, also, to, one, s, life, and, liberty, on, this, account, the, state, provides, the, basis, for, social, cohesion, and, productivity, creating, incentives, for, wealth, creation, by, providing, guarantees, of, protection, for, one, s, life, liberty, and, personal, property, provision, of, public, goods, is, considered, by, some, such, as, adam, smith, as, a, central, function, of, the, state, since, these, goods, would, otherwise, be, underprovided, tilly, has, challenged, narratives, of, the, state, as, being, the, result, of, a, societal, contract, or, provision, of, services, in, a, free, market, he, characterizes, the, state, more, akin, as, a, protection, racket, in, the, vein, of, organized, crime, while, economic, and, political, philosophers, have, contested, the, monopolistic, tendency, of, states, robert, nozick, argues, that, the, use, of, force, naturally, tends, towards, monopoly, another, commonly, accepted, definition, of, the, state, is, the, one, given, at, the, montevideo, convention, on, rights, and, duties, of, states, in, 1933, it, provides, that, he, state, as, a, person, of, international, law, should, possess, the, following, qualifications, a, a, permanent, population, b, a, defined, territory, c, government, and, d, capacity, to, enter, into, relations, with, the, other, states, and, that, he, federal, state, shall, constitute, a, sole, person, in, the, eyes, of, international, law, confounding, the, definition, problem, is, that, state, and, government, are, often, used, as, synonyms, in, common, conversation, and, even, some, academic, discourse, according, to, this, definition, schema, the, states, are, nonphysical, persons, of, international, law, governments, are, organizations, of, people, the, relationship, between, a, government, and, its, state, is, one, of, representation, and, authorized, agency, charles, tilly, distinguished, between, empires, theocracies, city, states, and, nation, states, according, to, michael, mann, the, four, persistent, types, of, state, activities, are, josep, colomer, distinguished, between, empires, and, states, in, the, following, way, according, to, michael, hechter, and, william, brustein, the, modern, state, was, differentiated, from, leagues, of, independent, cities, empires, federations, held, together, by, loose, central, control, and, theocratic, federations, by, four, characteristics, states, may, be, classified, by, political, philosophers, as, sovereign, if, they, are, not, dependent, on, or, subject, to, any, other, power, or, state, other, states, are, subject, to, external, sovereignty, or, hegemony, where, ultimate, sovereignty, lies, in, another, state, many, states, are, federated, states, which, participate, in, a, federal, union, a, federated, state, is, a, territorial, and, constitutional, community, forming, part, of, a, federation, compare, confederacies, or, confederations, such, as, switzerland, such, states, differ, from, sovereign, states, in, that, they, have, transferred, a, portion, of, their, sovereign, powers, to, a, federal, government, one, can, commonly, and, sometimes, readily, but, not, necessarily, usefully, classify, states, according, to, their, apparent, make, up, or, focus, the, concept, of, the, nation, state, theoretically, or, ideally, co, terminous, with, a, nation, became, very, popular, by, the, 20th, century, in, europe, but, occurred, rarely, elsewhere, or, at, other, times, in, contrast, some, states, have, sought, to, make, a, virtue, of, their, multi, ethnic, or, multinational, character, habsburg, austria, hungary, for, example, or, the, soviet, union, and, have, emphasised, unifying, characteristics, such, as, autocracy, monarchical, legitimacy, or, ideology, other, states, often, fascist, or, authoritarian, ones, promoted, state, sanctioned, notions, of, racial, superiority, other, states, may, bring, ideas, of, commonality, and, inclusiveness, to, the, fore, note, the, res, publica, of, ancient, rome, and, the, rzeczpospolita, of, poland, lithuania, which, finds, echoes, in, the, modern, day, republic, the, concept, of, temple, states, centred, on, religious, shrines, occurs, in, some, discussions, of, the, ancient, world, relatively, small, city, states, once, a, relatively, common, and, often, successful, form, of, polity, have, become, rarer, and, comparatively, less, prominent, in, modern, times, modern, day, independent, city, states, include, vatican, city, monaco, and, singapore, other, city, states, survive, as, federated, states, like, the, present, day, german, city, states, or, as, otherwise, autonomous, entities, with, limited, sovereignty, like, hong, kong, gibraltar, and, ceuta, to, some, extent, urban, secession, the, creation, of, a, new, city, state, sovereign, or, federated, continues, to, be, discussed, in, the, early, 21st, century, in, cities, such, as, london, a, state, can, be, distinguished, from, a, government, the, state, is, the, organization, while, the, government, is, the, particular, group, of, people, the, administrative, bureaucracy, that, controls, the, state, apparatus, at, a, given, time, that, is, governments, are, the, means, through, which, state, power, is, employed, states, are, served, by, a, continuous, succession, of, different, governments, states, are, immaterial, and, nonphysical, social, objects, whereas, governments, are, groups, of, people, with, certain, coercive, powers, each, successive, government, is, composed, of, a, specialized, and, privileged, body, of, individuals, who, monopolize, political, decision, making, and, are, separated, by, status, and, organization, from, the, population, as, a, whole, states, can, also, be, distinguished, from, the, concept, of, a, nation, where, nation, refers, to, a, cultural, political, community, of, people, a, nation, state, refers, to, a, situation, where, a, single, ethnicity, is, associated, with, a, specific, state, in, the, classical, thought, the, state, was, identified, with, both, political, society, and, civil, society, as, a, form, of, political, community, while, the, modern, thought, distinguished, the, nation, state, as, a, political, society, from, civil, society, as, a, form, of, economic, society, thus, in, the, modern, thought, the, state, is, contrasted, with, civil, society, antonio, gramsci, believed, that, civil, society, is, the, primary, locus, of, political, activity, because, it, is, where, all, forms, of, identity, formation, ideological, struggle, the, activities, of, intellectuals, and, the, construction, of, hegemony, take, place, and, that, civil, society, was, the, nexus, connecting, the, economic, and, political, sphere, arising, out, of, the, collective, actions, of, civil, society, is, what, gramsci, calls, political, society, which, gramsci, differentiates, from, the, notion, of, the, state, as, a, polity, he, stated, that, politics, was, not, a, one, way, process, of, political, management, but, rather, that, the, activities, of, civil, organizations, conditioned, the, activities, of, political, parties, and, state, institutions, and, were, conditioned, by, them, in, turn, louis, althusser, argued, that, civil, organizations, such, as, church, schools, and, the, family, are, part, of, an, ideological, state, apparatus, which, complements, the, repressive, state, apparatus, such, as, police, and, military, in, reproducing, social, relations, j, rgen, habermas, spoke, of, a, public, sphere, that, was, distinct, from, both, the, economic, and, political, sphere, given, the, role, that, many, social, groups, have, in, the, development, of, public, policy, and, the, extensive, connections, between, state, bureaucracies, and, other, institutions, it, has, become, increasingly, difficult, to, identify, the, boundaries, of, the, state, privatization, nationalization, and, the, creation, of, new, regulatory, bodies, also, change, the, boundaries, of, the, state, in, relation, to, society, often, the, nature, of, quasi, autonomous, organizations, is, unclear, generating, debate, among, political, scientists, on, whether, they, are, part, of, the, state, or, civil, society, some, political, scientists, thus, prefer, to, speak, of, policy, networks, and, decentralized, governance, in, modern, societies, rather, than, of, state, bureaucracies, and, direct, state, control, over, policy, the, earliest, forms, of, the, state, emerged, whenever, it, became, possible, to, centralize, power, in, a, durable, way, agriculture, and, a, settled, population, have, been, attributed, as, necessary, conditions, to, form, states, certain, types, of, agriculture, are, more, conducive, to, state, formation, such, as, grain, wheat, barley, millet, because, they, are, suited, to, concentrated, production, taxation, and, storage, agriculture, and, writing, are, almost, everywhere, associated, with, this, process, agriculture, because, it, allowed, for, the, emergence, of, a, social, class, of, people, who, did, not, have, to, spend, most, of, their, time, providing, for, their, own, subsistence, and, writing, or, an, equivalent, of, writing, like, inca, quipus, because, it, made, possible, the, centralization, of, vital, information, bureaucratization, made, expansion, over, large, territories, possible, the, first, known, states, were, created, in, the, egypt, mesopotamia, india, china, mesoamerica, and, the, andes, it, is, only, in, relatively, modern, times, that, states, have, almost, completely, displaced, alternative, stateless, forms, of, political, organization, of, societies, all, over, the, planet, roving, bands, of, hunter, gatherers, and, even, fairly, sizable, and, complex, tribal, societies, based, on, herding, or, agriculture, have, existed, without, any, full, time, specialized, state, organization, and, these, stateless, forms, of, political, organization, have, in, fact, prevailed, for, all, of, the, prehistory, and, much, of, human, history, and, civilization, the, primary, competing, organizational, forms, to, the, state, were, religious, organizations, such, as, the, church, and, city, republics, since, the, late, 19th, century, virtually, the, entirety, of, the, world, s, inhabitable, land, has, been, parcelled, up, into, areas, with, more, or, less, definite, borders, claimed, by, various, states, earlier, quite, large, land, areas, had, been, either, unclaimed, or, uninhabited, or, inhabited, by, nomadic, peoples, who, were, not, organised, as, states, however, even, within, present, day, states, there, are, vast, areas, of, wilderness, like, the, amazon, rainforest, which, are, uninhabited, or, inhabited, solely, or, mostly, by, indigenous, people, and, some, of, them, remain, uncontacted, also, there, are, so, called, failed, states, which, do, not, hold, de, facto, control, over, all, of, their, claimed, territory, or, where, this, control, is, challenged, currently, the, international, community, comprises, around, 200, sovereign, states, the, vast, majority, of, which, are, represented, in, the, united, nations, for, most, of, human, history, people, have, lived, in, stateless, societies, characterized, by, a, lack, of, concentrated, authority, and, the, absence, of, large, inequalities, in, economic, and, political, power, the, anthropologist, tim, ingold, writes, it, is, not, enough, to, observe, in, a, now, rather, dated, anthropological, idiom, that, hunter, gatherers, live, in, stateless, societies, as, though, their, social, lives, were, somehow, lacking, or, unfinished, waiting, to, be, completed, by, the, evolutionary, development, of, a, state, apparatus, rather, the, principal, of, their, socialty, as, pierre, clastres, has, put, it, is, fundamentally, against, the, state, during, the, neolithic, period, human, societies, underwent, major, cultural, and, economic, changes, including, the, development, of, agriculture, the, formation, of, sedentary, societies, and, fixed, settlements, increasing, population, densities, and, the, use, of, pottery, and, more, complex, tools, sedentary, agriculture, led, to, the, development, of, property, rights, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, and, larger, family, sizes, it, also, provided, the, basis, for, an, external, centralized, state, by, producing, a, large, surplus, of, food, more, division, of, labor, was, realized, which, enabled, people, to, specialize, in, tasks, other, than, food, production, early, states, were, characterized, by, highly, stratified, societies, with, a, privileged, and, wealthy, ruling, class, that, was, subordinate, to, a, monarch, the, ruling, classes, began, to, differentiate, themselves, through, forms, of, architecture, and, other, cultural, practices, that, were, different, from, those, of, the, subordinate, laboring, classes, in, the, past, it, was, suggested, that, the, centralized, state, was, developed, to, administer, large, public, works, systems, such, as, irrigation, systems, and, to, regulate, complex, economies, however, modern, archaeological, and, anthropological, evidence, does, not, support, this, thesis, pointing, to, the, existence, of, several, non, stratified, and, politically, decentralized, complex, societies, mesopotamia, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, location, of, the, earliest, civilization, or, complex, society, meaning, that, it, contained, cities, full, time, division, of, labor, social, concentration, of, wealth, into, capital, unequal, distribution, of, wealth, ruling, classes, community, ties, based, on, residency, rather, than, kinship, long, distance, trade, monumental, architecture, standardized, forms, of, art, and, culture, writing, and, mathematics, and, science, it, was, the, world, s, first, literate, civilization, and, formed, the, first, sets, of, written, laws, bronze, metallurgy, spread, within, afro, eurasia, from, c, 3000, bc, leading, to, a, military, revolution, in, the, use, of, bronze, weaponry, which, facilitated, the, rise, of, states, although, state, forms, existed, before, the, rise, of, the, ancient, greek, empire, the, greeks, were, the, first, people, known, to, have, explicitly, formulated, a, political, philosophy, of, the, state, and, to, have, rationally, analyzed, political, institutions, prior, to, this, states, were, described, and, justified, in, terms, of, religious, myths, several, important, political, innovations, of, classical, antiquity, came, from, the, greek, city, states, and, the, roman, republic, the, greek, city, states, before, the, 4th, century, granted, citizenship, rights, to, their, free, population, and, in, athens, these, rights, were, combined, with, a, directly, democratic, form, of, government, that, was, to, have, a, long, afterlife, in, political, thought, and, history, during, medieval, times, in, europe, the, state, was, organized, on, the, principle, of, feudalism, and, the, relationship, between, lord, and, vassal, became, central, to, social, organization, feudalism, led, to, the, development, of, greater, social, hierarchies, the, formalization, of, the, struggles, over, taxation, between, the, monarch, and, other, elements, of, society, especially, the, nobility, and, the, cities, gave, rise, to, what, is, now, called, the, standestaat, or, the, state, of, estates, characterized, by, parliaments, in, which, key, social, groups, negotiated, with, the, king, about, legal, and, economic, matters, these, estates, of, the, realm, sometimes, evolved, in, the, direction, of, fully, fledged, parliaments, but, sometimes, lost, out, in, their, struggles, with, the, monarch, leading, to, greater, centralization, of, lawmaking, and, military, power, in, his, hands, beginning, in, the, 15th, century, this, centralizing, process, gives, rise, to, the, absolutist, state, cultural, and, national, homogenization, figured, prominently, in, the, rise, of, the, modern, state, system, since, the, absolutist, period, states, have, largely, been, organized, on, a, national, basis, the, concept, of, a, national, state, however, is, not, synonymous, with, nation, state, even, in, the, most, ethnically, homogeneous, societies, there, is, not, always, a, complete, correspondence, between, state, and, nation, hence, the, active, role, often, taken, by, the, state, to, promote, nationalism, through, emphasis, on, shared, symbols, and, national, identity, charles, tilly, argues, that, the, number, of, total, states, in, western, europe, declined, rapidly, from, the, late, middle, ages, to, early, modern, era, during, a, process, of, state, formation, other, research, has, disputed, whether, such, a, decline, took, place, for, edmund, burke, dublin, 1729, beaconsfield, 1797, a, state, without, the, means, of, some, change, is, without, the, means, of, its, conservation, reflections, on, the, revolution, in, france, according, to, hendrik, spruyt, the, modern, state, is, different, from, its, predecessor, polities, in, two, main, aspects, 1, modern, states, have, greater, capacity, to, intervene, in, their, societies, and, 2, modern, states, are, buttressed, by, the, principle, of, international, legal, sovereignty, and, the, juridicial, equivalence, of, states, the, two, features, began, to, emerge, in, the, late, middle, ages, but, the, modern, state, form, took, centuries, to, come, firmly, into, fruition, other, aspects, of, modern, states, is, that, they, tend, to, be, organized, as, unified, national, polities, and, that, they, have, rational, legal, bureaucracies, sovereign, equality, did, not, become, fully, global, until, after, world, war, ii, amid, decolonization, adom, getachew, writes, that, it, was, not, until, the, 1960, declaration, on, the, granting, of, independence, to, colonial, countries, and, peoples, that, the, international, legal, context, for, popular, sovereignty, was, instituted, historians, jane, burbank, and, frederick, cooper, argue, that, westphalian, sovereignty, the, notion, that, bounded, unitary, states, interact, with, equivalent, states, has, more, to, do, with, 1948, than, 1648, theories, for, the, emergence, of, the, earliest, states, emphasize, grain, agriculture, and, settled, populations, as, necessary, conditions, some, argue, that, climate, change, led, to, a, greater, concentration, of, human, populations, around, dwindling, waterways, hendrik, spruyt, distinguishes, between, three, prominent, categories, of, explanations, for, the, emergence, of, the, modern, state, as, a, dominant, polity, 1, security, based, explanations, that, emphasize, the, role, of, warfare, 2, economy, based, explanations, that, emphasize, trade, property, rights, and, capitalism, as, drivers, behind, state, formation, and, 3, institutionalist, theories, that, sees, the, state, as, an, organizational, form, that, is, better, able, to, resolve, conflict, and, cooperation, problems, than, competing, political, organizations, according, to, philip, gorski, and, vivek, swaroop, sharma, the, neo, darwinian, framework, for, the, emergence, of, sovereign, states, is, the, dominant, explanation, in, the, scholarship, the, neo, darwininian, framework, emphasizes, how, the, modern, state, emerged, as, the, dominant, organizational, form, through, natural, selection, and, competition, most, political, theories, of, the, state, can, roughly, be, classified, into, two, categories, the, first, are, known, as, liberal, or, conservative, theories, which, treat, capitalism, as, a, given, and, then, concentrate, on, the, function, of, states, in, capitalist, society, these, theories, tend, to, see, the, state, as, a, neutral, entity, separated, from, society, and, the, economy, marxist, and, anarchist, theories, on, the, other, hand, see, politics, as, intimately, tied, in, with, economic, relations, and, emphasize, the, relation, between, economic, power, and, political, power, they, see, the, state, as, a, partisan, instrument, that, primarily, serves, the, interests, of, the, upper, class, anarchism, is, a, political, philosophy, which, considers, the, state, and, hierarchies, to, be, unnecessary, and, harmful, and, instead, promotes, a, stateless, society, or, anarchy, a, self, managed, self, governed, society, based, on, voluntary, cooperative, institutions, anarchists, believe, that, the, state, is, inherently, an, instrument, of, domination, and, repression, no, matter, who, is, in, control, of, it, anarchists, note, that, the, state, possesses, the, monopoly, on, the, legal, use, of, violence, unlike, marxists, anarchists, believe, that, revolutionary, seizure, of, state, power, should, not, be, a, political, goal, they, believe, instead, that, the, state, apparatus, should, be, completely, dismantled, and, an, alternative, set, of, social, relations, created, which, are, not, based, on, state, power, at, all, various, christian, anarchists, such, as, jacques, ellul, have, identified, the, state, and, political, power, as, the, beast, in, the, book, of, revelation, anarcho, capitalists, such, as, murray, rothbard, come, to, some, of, the, same, conclusions, about, the, state, apparatus, as, anarchists, but, for, different, reasons, the, two, principles, that, anarcho, capitalists, rely, on, most, are, consent, and, non, initiation, consent, in, anarcho, capitalist, theory, requires, that, individuals, explicitly, assent, to, the, jurisdiction, of, the, state, excluding, lockean, tacit, consent, consent, may, also, create, a, right, of, secession, which, destroys, any, concept, of, government, monopoly, on, force, coercive, monopolies, are, excluded, by, the, non, initiation, of, force, principle, because, they, must, use, force, in, order, to, prevent, others, from, offering, the, same, service, that, they, do, anarcho, capitalists, start, from, the, belief, that, replacing, monopolistic, states, with, competitive, providers, is, necessary, from, a, normative, justice, based, scenario, anarcho, capitalists, believe, that, the, market, values, of, competition, and, privatization, can, better, provide, the, services, provided, by, the, state, murray, rothbard, argues, in, power, and, market, that, any, and, all, government, functions, could, better, be, fulfilled, by, private, actors, including, defense, infrastructure, and, legal, adjudication, marx, and, engels, were, clear, in, that, the, communist, goal, was, a, classless, society, in, which, the, state, would, have, withered, away, replaced, only, by, administration, of, things, their, views, are, found, throughout, their, collected, works, and, address, past, or, then, extant, state, forms, from, an, analytical, and, tactical, viewpoint, but, not, future, social, forms, speculation, about, which, is, generally, antithetical, to, groups, considering, themselves, marxist, but, who, not, having, conquered, the, existing, state, power, s, are, not, in, the, situation, of, supplying, the, institutional, form, of, an, actual, society, to, the, extent, that, it, makes, sense, there, is, no, single, marxist, theory, of, state, but, rather, several, different, purportedly, marxist, theories, have, been, developed, by, adherents, of, marxism, marx, s, early, writings, portrayed, the, bourgeois, state, as, parasitic, built, upon, the, superstructure, of, the, economy, and, working, against, the, public, interest, he, also, wrote, that, the, state, mirrors, class, relations, in, society, in, general, acting, as, a, regulator, and, repressor, of, class, struggle, and, as, a, tool, of, political, power, and, domination, for, the, ruling, class, the, communist, manifesto, claims, the, state, to, be, nothing, more, than, a, committee, for, managing, the, common, affairs, of, the, bourgeoisie, for, marxist, theorists, the, role, of, the, modern, bourgeois, state, is, determined, by, its, function, in, the, global, capitalist, order, ralph, miliband, argued, that, the, ruling, class, uses, the, state, as, its, instrument, to, dominate, society, by, virtue, of, the, interpersonal, ties, between, state, officials, and, economic, elites, for, miliband, the, state, is, dominated, by, an, elite, that, comes, from, the, same, background, as, the, capitalist, class, state, officials, therefore, share, the, same, interests, as, owners, of, capital, and, are, linked, to, them, through, a, wide, array, of, social, economic, and, political, ties, gramsci, s, theories, of, state, emphasized, that, the, state, is, only, one, of, the, institutions, in, society, that, helps, maintain, the, hegemony, of, the, ruling, class, and, that, state, power, is, bolstered, by, the, ideological, domination, of, the, institutions, of, civil, society, such, as, churches, schools, and, mass, media, pluralists, view, society, as, a, collection, of, individuals, and, groups, who, are, competing, for, political, power, they, then, view, the, state, as, a, neutral, body, that, simply, enacts, the, will, of, whichever, groups, dominate, the, electoral, process, within, the, pluralist, tradition, robert, dahl, developed, the, theory, of, the, state, as, a, neutral, arena, for, contending, interests, or, its, agencies, as, simply, another, set, of, interest, groups, with, power, competitively, arranged, in, society, state, policy, is, a, product, of, recurrent, bargaining, although, pluralism, recognizes, the, existence, of, inequality, it, asserts, that, all, groups, have, an, opportunity, to, pressure, the, state, the, pluralist, approach, suggests, that, the, modern, democratic, state, s, actions, are, the, result, of, pressures, applied, by, a, variety, of, organized, interests, dahl, called, this, kind, of, state, a, polyarchy, pluralism, has, been, challenged, on, the, ground, that, it, is, not, supported, by, empirical, evidence, citing, surveys, showing, that, the, large, majority, of, people, in, high, leadership, positions, are, members, of, the, wealthy, upper, class, critics, of, pluralism, claim, that, the, state, serves, the, interests, of, the, upper, class, rather, than, equitably, serving, the, interests, of, all, social, groups, j, rgen, habermas, believed, that, the, base, superstructure, framework, used, by, many, marxist, theorists, to, describe, the, relation, between, the, state, and, the, economy, was, overly, simplistic, he, felt, that, the, modern, state, plays, a, large, role, in, structuring, the, economy, by, regulating, economic, activity, and, being, a, large, scale, economic, consumer, producer, and, through, its, redistributive, welfare, state, activities, because, of, the, way, these, activities, structure, the, economic, framework, habermas, felt, that, the, state, cannot, be, looked, at, as, passively, responding, to, economic, class, interests, michel, foucault, believed, that, modern, political, theory, was, too, state, centric, saying, maybe, after, all, the, state, is, no, more, than, a, composite, reality, and, a, mythologized, abstraction, whose, importance, is, a, lot, more, limited, than, many, of, us, think, he, thought, that, political, theory, was, focusing, too, much, on, abstract, institutions, and, not, enough, on, the, actual, practices, of, government, in, foucault, s, opinion, the, state, had, no, essence, he, believed, that, instead, of, trying, to, understand, the, activities, of, governments, by, analyzing, the, properties, of, the, state, a, reified, abstraction, political, theorists, should, be, examining, changes, in, the, practice, of, government, to, understand, changes, in, the, nature, of, the, state, foucault, developed, the, concept, of, governmentality, while, considering, the, genealogy, of, state, and, considers, the, way, in, which, an, individual, s, understanding, of, governance, can, influence, the, function, of, the, state, foucault, argues, that, it, is, technology, that, has, created, and, made, the, state, so, elusive, and, successful, and, that, instead, of, looking, at, the, state, as, something, to, be, toppled, we, should, look, at, the, state, as, technological, manifestation, or, system, with, many, heads, foucault, argues, instead, of, something, to, be, overthrown, as, in, the, sense, of, the, marxist, and, anarchist, understanding, of, the, state, every, single, scientific, technological, advance, has, come, to, the, service, of, the, state, foucault, argues, and, it, is, with, the, emergence, of, the, mathematical, sciences, and, essentially, the, formation, of, mathematical, statistics, that, one, gets, an, understanding, of, the, complex, technology, of, producing, how, the, modern, state, was, so, successfully, created, foucault, insists, that, the, nation, state, was, not, a, historical, accident, but, a, deliberate, production, in, which, the, modern, state, had, to, now, manage, coincidentally, with, the, emerging, practice, of, the, police, cameral, science, allowing, the, population, to, now, come, in, into, jus, gentium, and, civitas, civil, society, after, deliberately, being, excluded, for, several, millennia, democracy, wasn, t, the, newly, formed, voting, franchise, as, is, always, painted, by, both, political, revolutionaries, and, political, philosophers, as, a, cry, for, political, freedom, or, wanting, to, be, accepted, by, the, ruling, elite, foucault, insists, but, was, a, part, of, a, skilled, endeavour, of, switching, over, new, technology, such, as, translatio, imperii, plenitudo, potestatis, and, extra, ecclesiam, nulla, salus, readily, available, from, the, past, medieval, period, into, mass, persuasion, for, the, future, industrial, political, population, deception, over, the, population, in, which, the, political, population, was, now, asked, to, insist, upon, itself, the, president, must, be, elected, where, these, political, symbol, agents, represented, by, the, pope, and, the, president, are, now, democratised, foucault, calls, these, new, forms, of, technology, biopower, and, form, part, of, our, political, inheritance, which, he, calls, biopolitics, heavily, influenced, by, gramsci, nicos, poulantzas, a, greek, neo, marxist, theorist, argued, that, capitalist, states, do, not, always, act, on, behalf, of, the, ruling, class, and, when, they, do, it, is, not, necessarily, the, case, because, state, officials, consciously, strive, to, do, so, but, because, the, structural, position, of, the, state, is, configured, in, such, a, way, to, ensure, that, the, long, term, interests, of, capital, are, always, dominant, poulantzas, main, contribution, to, the, marxist, literature, on, the, state, was, the, concept, of, relative, autonomy, of, the, state, while, poulantzas, work, on, state, autonomy, has, served, to, sharpen, and, specify, a, great, deal, of, marxist, literature, on, the, state, his, own, framework, came, under, criticism, for, its, structural, functionalism, it, can, be, considered, as, a, single, structural, universe, the, historical, reality, that, takes, shape, in, societies, characterized, by, a, codified, or, crystallized, right, with, a, power, organized, hierarchically, and, justified, by, the, law, that, gives, it, authority, with, a, well, defined, social, and, economic, stratification, with, an, economic, and, social, organization, that, gives, the, society, precise, organic, characteristics, with, one, or, multiple, religious, organizations, in, justification, of, the, power, expressed, by, such, a, society, and, in, support, of, the, religious, beliefs, of, individuals, and, accepted, by, society, as, a, whole, such, a, structural, universe, evolves, in, a, cyclical, manner, presenting, two, different, historical, phases, a, mercantile, phase, or, open, society, and, a, feudal, phase, or, closed, society, with, characteristics, so, divergent, that, it, can, qualify, as, two, different, levels, of, civilization, which, however, are, never, definitive, but, that, alternate, cyclically, being, able, each, of, the, two, different, levels, to, be, considered, progressive, in, a, partisan, way, totally, independent, of, the, real, value, of, well, being, degrees, of, freedom, granted, equality, realized, and, a, concrete, possibility, to, achieve, further, progress, of, the, level, of, civilization, even, by, the, most, cultured, fractions, educated, and, intellectually, more, equipped, than, the, various, societies, of, both, historical, phases, state, autonomy, theorists, believe, that, the, state, is, an, entity, that, is, impervious, to, external, social, and, economic, influence, and, has, interests, of, its, own, new, institutionalist, writings, on, the, state, such, as, the, works, of, theda, skocpol, suggest, that, state, actors, are, to, an, important, degree, autonomous, in, other, words, state, personnel, have, interests, of, their, own, which, they, can, and, do, pursue, independently, of, at, times, in, conflict, with, actors, in, society, since, the, state, controls, the, means, of, coercion, and, given, the, dependence, of, many, groups, in, civil, society, on, the, state, for, achieving, any, goals, they, may, espouse, state, personnel, can, to, some, extent, impose, their, own, preferences, on, civil, society, states, generally, rely, on, a, claim, to, some, form, of, political, legitimacy, in, order, to, maintain, domination, over, their, subjects, various, social, contract, theories, have, been, proffered, to, establish, state, legitimacy, and, to, explain, state, formation, common, elements, in, these, theories, are, a, state, of, nature, that, incentivizes, people, to, seek, out, the, establishment, of, a, state, thomas, hobbes, described, the, state, of, nature, as, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, leviathan, chapters, xiii, xiv, locke, takes, a, more, benign, view, of, the, state, of, nature, and, is, unwilling, to, take, as, hard, a, stance, on, the, degeneracy, of, the, state, of, nature, he, does, agree, that, it, is, equally, incapable, of, providing, a, high, quality, of, life, locke, argues, for, inalienable, human, rights, one, of, the, most, significant, rights, for, locke, was, the, right, to, property, he, viewed, it, as, a, keystone, right, that, was, inadequately, protected, in, the, state, of, nature, social, contract, theorists, frequently, argue, for, some, level, of, natural, rights, in, order, to, protect, their, ability, to, exercise, these, rights, they, are, willing, to, give, up, some, other, rights, to, the, state, to, allow, it, to, establish, governance, social, contract, theory, then, bases, government, legitimacy, on, the, consent, of, the, governed, but, such, legitimacy, only, extends, as, far, as, the, governed, have, consented, this, line, of, reasoning, figures, prominently, in, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, the, rise, of, the, modern, day, state, system, was, closely, related, to, changes, in, political, thought, especially, concerning, the, changing, understanding, of, legitimate, state, power, and, control, early, modern, defenders, of, absolutism, absolute, monarchy, such, as, thomas, hobbes, and, jean, bodin, undermined, the, doctrine, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, by, arguing, that, the, power, of, kings, should, be, justified, by, reference, to, the, people, hobbes, in, particular, went, further, to, argue, that, political, power, should, be, justified, with, reference, to, the, individual, hobbes, wrote, in, the, time, of, the, english, civil, war, not, just, to, the, people, understood, collectively, both, hobbes, and, bodin, thought, they, were, defending, the, power, of, kings, not, advocating, for, democracy, but, their, arguments, about, the, nature, of, sovereignty, were, fiercely, resisted, by, more, traditional, defenders, of, the, power, of, kings, such, as, sir, robert, filmer, in, england, who, thought, that, such, defenses, ultimately, opened, the, way, to, more, democratic, claims, max, weber, identified, three, main, sources, of, political, legitimacy, in, his, works, the, first, legitimacy, based, on, traditional, grounds, is, derived, from, a, belief, that, things, should, be, as, they, have, been, in, the, past, and, that, those, who, defend, these, traditions, have, a, legitimate, claim, to, power, the, second, legitimacy, based, on, charismatic, leadership, is, devotion, to, a, leader, or, group, that, is, viewed, as, exceptionally, heroic, or, virtuous, the, third, is, rational, legal, authority, whereby, legitimacy, is, derived, from, the, belief, that, a, certain, group, has, been, placed, in, power, in, a, legal, manner, and, that, their, actions, are, justifiable, according, to, a, specific, code, of, written, laws, weber, believed, that, the, modern, state, is, characterized, primarily, by, appeals, to, rational, legal, authority, some, states, are, often, labeled, as, weak, or, failed, in, david, samuels, s, words, a, failed, state, occurs, when, sovereignty, over, claimed, territory, has, collapsed, or, was, never, effectively, at, all, authors, like, samuels, and, joel, s, migdal, have, explored, the, emergence, of, weak, states, how, they, are, different, from, western, strong, states, and, its, consequences, to, the, economic, development, of, developing, countries, samuels, introduces, the, idea, of, state, capacity, which, he, uses, to, refer, to, the, ability, of, the, state, to, fulfill, its, basic, functions, such, as, providing, security, maintaining, law, and, order, and, delivering, public, services, when, a, state, does, not, accomplish, this, state, failure, happens, samuels, 2012, other, authors, like, jeffrey, herbst, add, to, this, idea, by, arguing, that, state, failure, is, the, result, of, weak, or, non, existent, institutions, which, means, that, there, is, no, state, legitimacy, because, states, are, not, able, to, provide, goods, or, services, or, maintain, order, and, safety, herbst, 1990, however, there, are, also, ideas, that, challenge, this, notion, of, state, failure, stephen, d, krasner, argues, that, state, failure, is, not, just, the, result, of, weak, institutions, but, rather, a, very, complex, phenomenon, that, varies, according, to, context, specific, circumstances, and, should, therefore, not, be, analyzed, through, a, simplistic, understanding, like, the, one, normally, presented, krasner, 2004, in, the, problem, of, failed, states, susan, rice, argues, that, state, failure, is, an, important, threat, to, global, stability, and, security, since, failed, states, are, vulnerable, to, terrorism, and, conflict, rice, 1994, additionally, it, is, believed, that, state, failure, hinders, democratic, values, since, these, states, often, experience, political, violence, authoritarian, rules, and, a, number, of, human, rights, abuses, rotberg, 2004, while, there, is, great, discussion, regarding, the, direct, effects, of, state, failure, its, indirect, effects, should, also, be, highlighted, state, failure, could, lead, to, refugee, flows, and, cross, border, conflicts, while, also, becoming, safe, havens, for, criminal, or, extremist, groups, corbridge, 2005, in, order, to, solve, and, prevent, these, issues, in, the, future, it, is, necessary, to, focus, on, building, strong, institutions, promoting, economic, diversification, and, development, and, addressing, the, causes, of, violence, in, each, state, mkandawire, 2001, to, understand, the, formation, of, weak, states, samuels, compares, the, formation, of, european, states, in, the, 1600s, with, the, conditions, under, which, more, recent, states, were, formed, in, the, twentieth, century, in, this, line, of, argument, the, state, allows, a, population, to, resolve, a, collective, action, problem, in, which, citizens, recognize, the, authority, of, the, state, and, this, exercise, the, power, of, coercion, over, them, this, kind, of, social, organization, required, a, decline, in, legitimacy, of, traditional, forms, of, ruling, like, religious, authorities, and, replaced, them, with, an, increase, in, the, legitimacy, of, depersonalized, rule, an, increase, in, the, central, government, s, sovereignty, and, an, increase, in, the, organizational, complexity, of, the, central, government, bureaucracy, the, transition, to, this, modern, state, was, possible, in, europe, around, 1600, thanks, to, the, confluence, of, factors, like, the, technological, developments, in, warfare, which, generated, strong, incentives, to, tax, and, consolidate, central, structures, of, governance, to, respond, to, external, threats, this, was, complemented, by, the, increase, of, the, production, of, food, as, a, result, of, productivity, improvements, which, allowed, to, sustain, a, larger, population, and, so, increased, the, complexity, and, centralization, of, states, finally, cultural, changes, challenged, the, authority, of, monarchies, and, paved, the, way, to, the, emergence, of, modern, states, the, conditions, that, enabled, the, emergence, of, modern, states, in, europe, were, different, for, other, countries, that, started, this, process, later, as, a, result, many, of, these, states, lack, effective, capabilities, to, tax, and, extract, revenue, from, their, citizens, which, derives, in, problems, like, corruption, tax, evasion, and, low, economic, growth, unlike, the, european, case, late, state, formation, occurred, in, a, context, of, limited, international, conflict, that, diminished, the, incentives, to, tax, and, increase, military, spending, also, many, of, these, states, emerged, from, colonization, in, a, state, of, poverty, and, with, institutions, designed, to, extract, natural, resources, which, have, made, more, difficult, to, form, states, european, colonization, also, defined, many, arbitrary, borders, that, mixed, different, cultural, groups, under, the, same, national, identities, which, has, made, difficult, to, build, states, with, legitimacy, among, all, the, population, since, some, states, have, to, compete, for, it, with, other, forms, of, political, identity, as, a, complement, of, this, argument, migdal, gives, a, historical, account, on, how, sudden, social, changes, in, the, third, world, during, the, industrial, revolution, contributed, to, the, formation, of, weak, states, the, expansion, of, international, trade, that, started, around, 1850, brought, profound, changes, in, africa, asia, and, latin, america, that, were, introduced, with, the, objective, of, assure, the, availability, of, raw, materials, for, the, european, market, these, changes, consisted, in, i, reforms, to, landownership, laws, with, the, objective, of, integrate, more, lands, to, the, international, economy, ii, increase, in, the, taxation, of, peasants, and, little, landowners, as, well, as, collecting, of, these, taxes, in, cash, instead, of, in, kind, as, was, usual, up, to, that, moment, and, iii, the, introduction, of, new, and, less, costly, modes, of, transportation, mainly, railroads, as, a, result, the, traditional, forms, of, social, control, became, obsolete, deteriorating, the, existing, institutions, and, opening, the, way, to, the, creation, of, new, ones, that, not, necessarily, lead, these, countries, to, build, strong, states, this, fragmentation, of, the, social, order, induced, a, political, logic, in, which, these, states, were, captured, to, some, extent, by, strongmen, who, were, capable, to, take, advantage, of, the, above, mentioned, changes, and, that, challenge, the, sovereignty, of, the, state, as, a, result, these, decentralization, of, social, control, impedes, to, consolidate, strong, states, quotations, related, to, state,
