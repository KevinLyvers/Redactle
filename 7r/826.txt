poverty, is, a, state, or, condition, in, which, an, individual, lacks, the, financial, resources, and, essentials, for, a, certain, standard, of, living, poverty, can, have, diverse, environmental, legal, social, economic, and, political, causes, and, effects, when, evaluating, poverty, in, statistics, or, economics, there, are, two, main, measures, absolute, poverty, which, compares, income, against, the, amount, needed, to, meet, basic, personal, needs, such, as, food, clothing, and, shelter, secondly, relative, poverty, measures, when, a, person, cannot, meet, a, minimum, level, of, living, standards, compared, to, others, in, the, same, time, and, place, the, definition, of, relative, poverty, varies, from, one, country, to, another, or, from, one, society, to, another, statistically, as, of, 2019, most, of, the, world, s, population, live, in, poverty, in, ppp, dollars, 85, of, people, live, on, less, than, 30, per, day, two, thirds, live, on, less, than, 10, per, day, and, 10, live, on, less, than, 1, 90, per, day, according, to, the, world, bank, group, in, 2020, more, than, 40, of, the, poor, live, in, conflict, affected, countries, even, when, countries, experience, economic, development, the, poorest, citizens, of, middle, income, countries, frequently, do, not, gain, an, adequate, share, of, their, countries, increased, wealth, to, leave, poverty, governments, and, non, governmental, organizations, have, experimented, with, a, number, of, different, policies, and, programs, for, poverty, alleviation, such, as, electrification, in, rural, areas, or, housing, first, policies, in, urban, areas, the, international, policy, frameworks, for, poverty, alleviation, established, by, the, united, nations, in, 2015, are, summarized, in, sustainable, development, goal, 1, no, poverty, social, forces, such, as, gender, disability, race, and, ethnicity, can, exacerbate, issues, of, poverty, with, women, children, and, minorities, frequently, bearing, unequal, burdens, of, poverty, moreover, impoverished, individuals, are, more, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, other, social, issues, such, as, the, environmental, effects, of, industry, or, the, impacts, of, climate, change, or, other, natural, disasters, or, extreme, weather, events, poverty, can, also, make, other, social, problems, worse, economic, pressures, on, impoverished, communities, frequently, play, a, part, in, deforestation, biodiversity, loss, and, ethnic, conflict, for, this, reason, the, un, s, sustainable, development, goals, and, other, international, policy, programs, such, as, the, international, recovery, from, covid, 19, emphasize, the, connection, of, poverty, alleviation, with, other, societal, goals, the, word, poverty, comes, from, the, old, norman, french, word, povert, modern, french, pauvret, from, latin, paupert, s, from, pauper, poor, there, are, several, definitions, of, poverty, depending, on, the, context, of, the, situation, it, is, placed, in, it, usually, references, a, state, or, condition, in, which, a, person, or, community, lacks, the, financial, resources, and, essentials, for, a, certain, standard, of, living, united, nations, fundamentally, poverty, is, a, denial, of, choices, and, opportunities, a, violation, of, human, dignity, it, means, lack, of, basic, capacity, to, participate, effectively, in, society, it, means, not, having, enough, to, feed, and, clothe, a, family, not, having, a, school, or, clinic, to, go, to, not, having, the, land, on, which, to, grow, one, s, food, or, a, job, to, earn, one, s, living, not, having, access, to, credit, it, means, insecurity, powerlessness, and, exclusion, of, individuals, households, and, communities, it, means, susceptibility, to, violence, and, it, often, implies, living, in, marginal, or, fragile, environments, without, access, to, clean, water, or, sanitation, world, bank, poverty, is, pronounced, deprivation, in, well, being, and, comprises, many, dimensions, it, includes, low, incomes, and, the, inability, to, acquire, the, basic, goods, and, services, necessary, for, survival, with, dignity, poverty, also, encompasses, low, levels, of, health, and, education, poor, access, to, clean, water, and, sanitation, inadequate, physical, security, lack, of, voice, and, insufficient, capacity, and, opportunity, to, better, one, s, life, european, union, eu, the, european, union, s, definition, of, poverty, is, significantly, different, from, definitions, in, other, parts, of, the, world, and, consequently, policy, measures, introduced, to, combat, poverty, in, eu, countries, also, differ, from, measures, in, other, nations, poverty, is, measured, in, relation, to, the, distribution, of, income, in, each, member, country, using, relative, income, poverty, lines, relative, income, poverty, rates, in, the, eu, are, compiled, by, the, eurostat, in, charge, of, coordinating, gathering, and, disseminating, member, country, statistics, using, european, union, survey, of, income, and, living, conditions, eu, silc, surveys, absolute, poverty, often, synonymous, with, extreme, poverty, or, abject, poverty, refers, to, a, set, standard, which, is, consistent, over, time, and, between, countries, this, set, standard, usually, refers, to, a, condition, characterized, by, severe, deprivation, of, basic, human, needs, including, food, safe, drinking, water, sanitation, facilities, health, shelter, education, and, information, it, depends, not, only, on, income, but, also, on, access, to, services, having, an, income, below, the, poverty, line, which, is, defined, as, an, income, needed, to, purchase, basic, needs, is, also, referred, to, as, primary, poverty, the, dollar, a, day, poverty, line, was, first, introduced, in, 1990, as, a, measure, to, meet, such, standards, of, living, for, nations, that, do, not, use, the, us, dollar, as, currency, dollar, a, day, does, not, translate, to, living, a, day, on, the, equivalent, amount, of, local, currency, as, determined, by, the, exchange, rate, rather, it, is, determined, by, the, purchasing, power, parity, rate, which, would, look, at, how, much, local, currency, is, needed, to, buy, the, same, things, that, a, dollar, could, buy, in, the, united, states, usually, this, would, translate, to, having, less, local, currency, than, if, the, exchange, rate, were, used, from, 1993, through, 2005, the, world, bank, defined, absolute, poverty, as, 1, 08, a, day, on, such, a, purchasing, power, parity, basis, after, adjusting, for, inflation, to, the, 1993, us, dollar, in, 2009, it, was, updated, as, 1, 25, a, day, equivalent, to, 1, 00, a, day, in, 1996, us, prices, and, in, 2015, it, was, updated, as, living, on, less, than, us, 1, 90, per, day, and, moderate, poverty, as, less, than, 2, or, 5, a, day, similarly, ultra, poverty, is, defined, by, a, 2007, report, issued, by, international, food, policy, research, institute, as, living, on, less, than, 54, cents, per, day, the, poverty, line, threshold, of, 1, 90, per, day, as, set, by, the, world, bank, is, controversial, each, nation, has, its, own, threshold, for, absolute, poverty, line, in, the, united, states, for, example, the, absolute, poverty, line, was, us, 15, 15, per, day, in, 2010, us, 22, 000, per, year, for, a, family, of, four, while, in, india, it, was, us, 1, 0, per, day, and, in, china, the, absolute, poverty, line, was, us, 0, 55, per, day, each, on, ppp, basis, in, 2010, these, different, poverty, lines, make, data, comparison, between, each, nation, s, official, reports, qualitatively, difficult, some, scholars, argue, that, the, world, bank, method, sets, the, bar, too, high, others, argue, it, is, too, low, there, is, disagreement, among, experts, as, to, what, would, be, considered, a, realistic, poverty, rate, with, one, considering, it, an, inaccurately, measured, and, arbitrary, cut, off, some, contend, that, a, higher, poverty, line, is, needed, such, as, a, minimum, of, 7, 40, or, even, 10, to, 15, a, day, they, argue, that, these, levels, are, a, minimum, for, basic, needs, and, to, achieve, normal, life, expectancy, one, estimate, places, the, true, scale, of, poverty, much, higher, than, the, world, bank, with, an, estimated, 4, 3, billion, people, 59, of, the, world, s, population, living, with, less, than, 5, a, day, and, unable, to, meet, basic, needs, adequately, philip, alston, a, un, special, rapporteur, on, extreme, poverty, and, human, rights, stated, the, world, bank, s, international, poverty, line, of, 1, 90, a, day, is, fundamentally, flawed, and, has, allowed, for, self, congratulatory, triumphalism, in, the, fight, against, extreme, global, poverty, which, he, asserts, is, completely, off, track, and, that, nearly, half, of, the, global, population, or, 3, 4, billion, lives, on, less, than, 5, 50, a, day, and, this, number, has, barely, moved, since, 1990, still, others, suggest, that, poverty, line, misleads, because, many, live, on, far, less, than, that, line, other, measures, of, absolute, poverty, without, using, a, certain, dollar, amount, include, the, standard, defined, as, receiving, less, than, 80, of, minimum, caloric, intake, whilst, spending, more, than, 80, of, income, on, food, sometimes, called, ultra, poverty, relative, poverty, views, poverty, as, socially, defined, and, dependent, on, social, context, it, is, argued, that, the, needs, considered, fundamental, is, not, an, objective, measure, and, could, change, with, the, custom, of, society, for, example, a, person, who, cannot, afford, housing, better, than, a, small, tent, in, an, open, field, would, be, said, to, live, in, relative, poverty, if, almost, everyone, else, in, that, area, lives, in, modern, brick, homes, but, not, if, everyone, else, also, lives, in, small, tents, in, open, fields, for, example, in, a, nomadic, tribe, since, richer, nations, would, have, lower, levels, of, absolute, poverty, relative, poverty, is, considered, the, most, useful, measure, for, ascertaining, poverty, rates, in, wealthy, developed, nations, and, is, the, most, prominent, and, most, quoted, of, the, eu, social, inclusion, indicators, usually, relative, poverty, is, measured, as, the, percentage, of, the, population, with, income, less, than, some, fixed, proportion, of, median, income, this, is, a, calculation, of, the, percentage, of, people, whose, family, household, income, falls, below, the, poverty, line, the, main, poverty, line, used, in, the, organisation, of, economic, cooperation, and, development, oecd, and, the, european, union, eu, is, based, on, economic, distance, a, level, of, income, set, at, 60, of, the, median, household, income, the, united, states, federal, government, typically, regulates, this, line, to, three, times, the, cost, of, an, adequate, meal, there, are, several, other, different, income, inequality, metrics, for, example, the, gini, coefficient, or, the, theil, index, rather, than, income, poverty, is, also, measured, through, individual, basic, needs, at, a, time, life, expectancy, has, greatly, increased, in, the, developing, world, since, world, war, ii, and, is, starting, to, close, the, gap, to, the, developed, world, child, mortality, has, decreased, in, every, developing, region, of, the, world, the, proportion, of, the, world, s, population, living, in, countries, where, the, daily, per, capita, supply, of, food, energy, is, less, than, 9, 200, kilojoules, 2, 200, kilocalories, decreased, from, 56, in, the, mid, 1960s, to, below, 10, by, the, 1990s, similar, trends, can, be, observed, for, literacy, access, to, clean, water, and, electricity, and, basic, consumer, items, poverty, may, also, be, understood, as, an, aspect, of, unequal, social, status, and, inequitable, social, relationships, experienced, as, social, exclusion, dependency, and, diminished, capacity, to, participate, or, to, develop, meaningful, connections, with, other, people, in, society, such, social, exclusion, can, be, minimized, through, strengthened, connections, with, the, mainstream, such, as, through, the, provision, of, relational, care, to, those, who, are, experiencing, poverty, the, world, bank, s, voices, of, the, poor, based, on, research, with, over, 20, 000, poor, people, in, 23, countries, identifies, a, range, of, factors, which, poor, people, identify, as, part, of, poverty, these, include, abuse, by, those, in, power, dis, empowering, institutions, excluded, locations, gender, relationships, lack, of, security, limited, capabilities, physical, limitations, precarious, livelihoods, problems, in, social, relationships, weak, community, organizations, and, discrimination, analysis, of, social, aspects, of, poverty, links, conditions, of, scarcity, to, aspects, of, the, distribution, of, resources, and, power, in, a, society, and, recognizes, that, poverty, may, be, a, function, of, the, diminished, capability, of, people, to, live, the, kinds, of, lives, they, value, the, social, aspects, of, poverty, may, include, lack, of, access, to, information, education, health, care, social, capital, or, political, power, relational, poverty, is, the, idea, that, societal, poverty, exists, if, there, is, a, lack, of, human, relationships, relational, poverty, can, be, the, result, of, a, lost, contact, number, lack, of, phone, ownership, isolation, or, deliberate, severing, of, ties, with, an, individual, or, community, relational, poverty, is, also, understood, by, the, social, institutions, that, organize, those, relationships, poverty, is, importantly, the, result, of, the, different, terms, and, conditions, on, which, people, are, included, in, social, life, in, the, united, kingdom, the, second, cameron, ministry, came, under, attack, for, its, redefinition, of, poverty, poverty, is, no, longer, classified, by, a, family, s, income, but, as, to, whether, a, family, is, in, work, or, not, considering, that, two, thirds, of, people, who, found, work, were, accepting, wages, that, are, below, the, living, wage, according, to, the, joseph, rowntree, foundation, this, has, been, criticised, by, anti, poverty, campaigners, as, an, unrealistic, view, of, poverty, in, the, united, kingdom, secondary, poverty, refers, to, those, that, earn, enough, income, to, not, be, impoverished, but, who, spend, their, income, on, unnecessary, pleasures, such, as, alcoholic, beverages, thus, placing, them, below, it, in, practice, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, great, britain, the, practice, of, temperance, among, methodists, as, well, as, their, rejection, of, gambling, allowed, them, to, eliminate, secondary, poverty, and, accumulate, capital, factors, that, contribute, to, secondary, poverty, includes, but, are, not, limited, to, alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and, drugs, substance, abuse, means, that, the, poor, typically, spend, about, 2, of, their, income, educating, their, children, but, larger, percentages, of, alcohol, and, tobacco, for, example, 6, in, indonesia, and, 8, in, mexico, poverty, levels, are, snapshot, pictures, in, time, that, omits, the, transitional, dynamics, between, levels, mobility, statistics, supply, additional, information, about, the, fraction, who, leave, the, poverty, level, for, example, one, study, finds, that, in, a, sixteen, year, period, 1975, to, 1991, in, the, us, only, 5, of, those, in, the, lower, fifth, of, the, income, level, were, still, at, that, level, while, 95, transitioned, to, a, higher, income, category, poverty, levels, can, remain, the, same, while, those, who, rise, out, of, poverty, are, replaced, by, others, the, transient, poor, and, chronic, poor, differ, in, each, society, in, a, nine, year, period, ending, in, 2005, for, the, us, 50, of, the, poorest, quintile, transitioned, to, a, higher, quintile, according, to, chen, and, ravallion, about, 1, 76, billion, people, in, the, developing, world, lived, above, 1, 25, per, day, and, 1, 9, billion, people, lived, below, 1, 25, per, day, in, 1981, in, 2005, about, 4, 09, billion, people, in, the, developing, world, lived, above, 1, 25, per, day, and, 1, 4, billion, people, lived, below, 1, 25, per, day, both, 1981, and, 2005, data, are, on, inflation, adjusted, basis, the, share, of, the, world, s, population, living, in, absolute, poverty, fell, from, 43, in, 1981, to, 14, in, 2011, the, absolute, number, of, people, in, poverty, fell, from, 1, 95, billion, in, 1981, to, 1, 01, billion, in, 2011, the, economist, max, roser, estimates, that, the, number, of, people, in, poverty, is, therefore, roughly, the, same, as, 200, years, ago, this, is, the, case, since, the, world, population, was, just, little, more, than, 1, billion, in, 1820, and, the, majority, 84, to, 94, of, the, world, population, was, living, in, poverty, according, to, one, study, the, percentage, of, the, world, population, in, hunger, and, poverty, fell, in, absolute, percentage, terms, from, 50, in, 1950, to, 30, in, 1970, according, to, another, study, the, number, of, people, worldwide, living, in, absolute, poverty, fell, from, 1, 18, billion, in, 1950, to, 1, 04, billion, in, 1977, according, to, another, study, the, number, of, people, worldwide, estimated, to, be, starving, fell, from, almost, 920, million, in, 1971, to, below, 797, million, in, 1997, the, proportion, of, the, developing, world, s, population, living, in, extreme, economic, poverty, fell, from, 28, in, 1990, to, 21, in, 2001, most, of, this, improvement, has, occurred, in, east, and, south, asia, in, 2012, it, was, estimated, that, using, a, poverty, line, of, 1, 25, a, day, 1, 2, billion, people, lived, in, poverty, given, the, current, economic, model, built, on, gdp, it, would, take, 100, years, to, bring, the, world, s, poorest, up, to, the, poverty, line, of, 1, 25, a, day, unicef, estimates, half, the, world, s, children, or, 1, 1, billion, live, in, poverty, the, world, bank, forecasted, in, 2015, that, 702, 1, million, people, were, living, in, extreme, poverty, down, from, 1, 75, billion, in, 1990, extreme, poverty, is, observed, in, all, parts, of, the, world, including, developed, economies, of, the, 2015, population, about, 347, 1, million, people, 35, 2, lived, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, 231, 3, million, 13, 5, lived, in, south, asia, according, to, the, world, bank, between, 1990, and, 2015, the, percentage, of, the, world, s, population, living, in, extreme, poverty, fell, from, 37, 1, to, 9, 6, falling, below, 10, for, the, first, time, during, the, 2013, to, 2015, period, the, world, bank, reported, that, extreme, poverty, fell, from, 11, to, 10, however, they, also, noted, that, the, rate, of, decline, had, slowed, by, nearly, half, from, the, 25, year, average, with, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, returning, to, early, 2000, levels, the, world, bank, attributed, this, to, increasing, violence, following, the, arab, spring, population, increases, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, general, african, inflationary, pressures, and, economic, malaise, were, the, primary, drivers, for, this, slow, down, many, wealthy, nations, have, seen, an, increase, in, relative, poverty, rates, ever, since, the, great, recession, in, particular, among, children, from, impoverished, families, who, often, reside, in, substandard, housing, and, find, educational, opportunities, out, of, reach, it, has, been, argued, by, some, academics, that, the, neoliberal, policies, promoted, by, global, financial, institutions, such, as, the, imf, and, the, world, bank, are, actually, exacerbating, both, inequality, and, poverty, in, east, asia, the, world, bank, reported, that, the, poverty, headcount, rate, at, the, 2, a, day, level, is, estimated, to, have, fallen, to, about, 27, percent, down, from, 29, 5, percent, in, 2006, and, 69, percent, in, 1990, the, people, s, republic, of, china, accounts, for, over, three, quarters, of, global, poverty, reduction, from, 1990, to, 2005, which, according, to, the, world, bank, is, historically, unprecedented, china, accounted, for, nearly, half, of, all, extreme, poverty, in, 1990, in, sub, saharan, africa, extreme, poverty, went, up, from, 41, in, 1981, to, 46, in, 2001, which, combined, with, growing, population, increased, the, number, of, people, living, in, extreme, poverty, from, 231, million, to, 318, million, statistics, of, 2018, shows, population, living, in, extreme, conditions, has, declined, by, more, than, 1, billion, in, the, last, 25, years, as, per, the, report, published, by, the, world, bank, on, 19, september, 2018, world, poverty, falls, below, 750, million, in, the, early, 1990s, some, of, the, transition, economies, of, central, and, eastern, europe, and, central, asia, experienced, a, sharp, drop, in, income, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, resulted, in, large, declines, in, gdp, per, capita, of, about, 30, to, 35, between, 1990, and, the, through, year, of, 1998, when, it, was, at, its, minimum, as, a, result, poverty, rates, tripled, excess, mortality, increased, and, life, expectancy, declined, russian, president, boris, yeltsin, s, imf, backed, rapid, privatization, and, austerity, policies, resulted, in, unemployment, rising, to, double, digits, and, half, the, russian, population, falling, into, destitution, by, the, early, to, mid, 1990s, by, 1999, during, the, peak, of, the, poverty, crisis, 191, million, people, were, living, on, less, than, 5, 50, a, day, in, subsequent, years, as, per, capita, incomes, recovered, the, poverty, rate, dropped, from, 31, 4, of, the, population, to, 19, 6, the, average, post, communist, country, had, returned, to, 1989, levels, of, per, capita, gdp, by, 2005, although, as, of, 2015, some, are, still, far, behind, that, according, to, the, world, bank, in, 2014, around, 80, million, people, were, still, living, on, less, than, 5, 00, a, day, world, bank, data, shows, that, the, percentage, of, the, population, living, in, households, with, consumption, or, income, per, person, below, the, poverty, line, has, decreased, in, each, region, of, the, world, except, middle, east, and, north, africa, since, 1990, in, july, 2023, a, group, of, over, 200, economists, from, 67, countries, including, jayati, ghosh, joseph, stiglitz, and, thomas, piketty, sent, a, letter, to, the, united, nations, secretary, general, ant, nio, guterres, and, world, bank, president, ajay, banga, warning, that, extreme, poverty, and, extreme, wealth, have, risen, sharply, and, simultaneously, for, the, first, time, in, 25, years, in, 2024, oxfam, reported, that, roughly, five, billion, people, have, become, poorer, since, 2020, and, warned, that, current, trends, could, postpone, global, poverty, eradication, for, 229, years, the, effects, of, poverty, may, also, be, causes, as, listed, above, thus, creating, a, poverty, cycle, operating, across, multiple, levels, individual, local, national, and, global, one, third, of, deaths, around, the, world, some, 18, million, people, a, year, or, 50, 000, per, day, are, due, to, poverty, related, causes, people, living, in, developing, nations, among, them, women, and, children, are, over, represented, among, the, global, poor, and, these, effects, of, severe, poverty, those, living, in, poverty, suffer, disproportionately, from, hunger, or, even, starvation, and, disease, as, well, as, lower, life, expectancy, according, to, the, world, health, organization, hunger, and, malnutrition, are, the, single, gravest, threats, to, the, world, s, public, health, and, malnutrition, is, by, far, the, biggest, contributor, to, child, mortality, present, in, half, of, all, cases, almost, 90, of, maternal, deaths, during, childbirth, occur, in, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, compared, to, less, than, 1, in, the, developed, world, those, who, live, in, poverty, have, also, been, shown, to, have, a, far, greater, likelihood, of, having, or, incurring, a, disability, within, their, lifetime, infectious, diseases, such, as, malaria, and, tuberculosis, can, perpetuate, poverty, by, diverting, health, and, economic, resources, from, investment, and, productivity, malaria, decreases, gdp, growth, by, up, to, 1, 3, in, some, developing, nations, and, aids, decreases, african, growth, by, 0, 3, 1, 5, annually, studies, have, shown, that, poverty, impedes, cognitive, function, although, some, of, these, findings, could, not, be, replicated, in, follow, up, studies, one, hypothesised, mechanism, is, that, financial, worries, put, a, severe, burden, on, one, s, mental, resources, so, that, they, are, no, longer, fully, available, for, solving, complicated, problems, the, reduced, capability, for, problem, solving, can, lead, to, suboptimal, decisions, and, further, perpetuate, poverty, many, other, pathways, from, poverty, to, compromised, cognitive, capacities, have, been, noted, from, poor, nutrition, and, environmental, toxins, to, the, effects, of, stress, on, parenting, behavior, all, of, which, lead, to, suboptimal, psychological, development, neuroscientists, have, documented, the, impact, of, poverty, on, brain, structure, and, function, throughout, the, lifespan, infectious, diseases, continue, to, blight, the, lives, of, the, poor, across, the, world, 36, 8, million, people, are, living, with, hiv, aids, with, 954, 492, deaths, in, 2017, poor, people, often, are, more, prone, to, severe, diseases, due, to, the, lack, of, health, care, and, due, to, living, in, non, optimal, conditions, among, the, poor, girls, tend, to, suffer, even, more, due, to, gender, discrimination, economic, stability, is, paramount, in, a, poor, household, otherwise, they, go, in, an, endless, loop, of, negative, income, trying, to, treat, diseases, often, when, a, person, in, a, poor, household, falls, ill, it, is, up, to, the, family, members, to, take, care, of, them, due, to, limited, access, to, health, care, and, lack, of, health, insurance, the, household, members, often, have, to, give, up, their, income, or, stop, seeking, further, education, to, tend, to, the, sick, member, there, is, a, greater, opportunity, cost, imposed, on, the, poor, to, tend, to, someone, compared, to, someone, with, better, financial, stability, increased, access, to, healthcare, and, improved, health, outcomes, help, prevent, individuals, from, falling, into, poverty, due, to, medical, expenses, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 02, billion, people, go, to, bed, hungry, every, night, according, to, the, global, hunger, index, sub, saharan, africa, had, the, highest, child, malnutrition, rate, of, the, world, s, regions, over, the, 2001, 2006, period, poor, people, spend, a, greater, portion, of, their, budgets, on, food, than, wealthy, people, and, as, a, result, they, can, be, particularly, vulnerable, to, increases, in, food, prices, for, example, in, late, 2007, increases, in, the, price, of, grains, led, to, food, riots, in, some, countries, threats, to, the, supply, of, food, may, also, be, caused, by, drought, and, the, water, crisis, intensive, farming, often, leads, to, a, vicious, cycle, of, exhaustion, of, soil, fertility, and, decline, of, agricultural, yields, approximately, 40, of, the, world, s, agricultural, land, is, seriously, degraded, goal, 2, of, the, sustainable, development, goals, is, the, elimination, of, hunger, and, undernutrition, by, 2030, a, psychological, study, has, been, conducted, by, four, scientists, during, inaugural, convention, of, psychological, science, the, results, find, that, people, who, thrive, with, financial, stability, or, fall, under, low, socioeconomic, status, ses, tend, to, perform, worse, cognitively, due, to, external, pressure, imposed, upon, them, the, research, found, that, stressors, such, as, low, income, inadequate, health, care, discrimination, and, exposure, to, criminal, activities, all, contribute, to, mental, disorders, this, study, also, found, that, children, exposed, to, poverty, stricken, environments, have, slower, cognitive, thinking, it, is, seen, that, children, perform, better, under, the, care, of, their, parents, and, that, children, tend, to, adopt, speaking, language, at, a, younger, age, since, being, in, poverty, from, childhood, is, more, harmful, than, it, is, for, an, adult, it, is, seen, that, children, in, poor, households, tend, to, fall, behind, in, certain, cognitive, abilities, compared, to, other, average, families, for, a, child, to, grow, up, emotionally, healthy, the, children, under, three, need, a, strong, reliable, primary, caregiver, who, provides, consistent, and, unconditional, love, guidance, and, support, safe, predictable, stable, environments, ten, to, 20, hours, each, week, of, harmonious, reciprocal, interactions, this, process, known, as, attunement, is, most, crucial, during, the, first, 6, 24, months, of, infants, lives, and, helps, them, develop, a, wider, range, of, healthy, emotions, including, gratitude, forgiveness, and, empathy, enrichment, through, personalized, increasingly, complex, activities, in, one, survey, 67, of, children, from, disadvantaged, inner, cities, said, they, had, witnessed, a, serious, assault, and, 33, reported, witnessing, a, homicide, 51, of, fifth, graders, from, new, orleans, median, income, for, a, household, 27, 133, have, been, found, to, be, victims, of, violence, compared, to, 32, in, washington, dc, mean, income, for, a, household, 40, 127, studies, have, shown, that, poverty, changes, the, personalities, of, children, who, live, in, it, the, great, smoky, mountains, study, was, a, ten, year, study, that, was, able, to, demonstrate, this, during, the, study, about, one, quarter, of, the, families, saw, a, dramatic, and, unexpected, increase, in, income, the, study, showed, that, among, these, children, instances, of, behavioral, and, emotional, disorders, decreased, and, conscientiousness, and, agreeableness, increased, research, has, found, that, there, is, a, high, risk, of, educational, underachievement, for, children, who, are, from, low, income, housing, circumstances, this, is, often, a, process, that, begins, in, primary, school, instruction, in, the, us, educational, system, as, well, as, in, most, other, countries, tends, to, be, geared, towards, those, students, who, come, from, more, advantaged, backgrounds, as, a, result, children, in, poverty, are, at, a, higher, risk, than, advantaged, children, for, retention, in, their, grade, special, deleterious, placements, during, the, school, s, hours, and, not, completing, their, high, school, education, advantage, breeds, advantage, there, are, many, explanations, for, why, students, tend, to, drop, out, of, school, one, is, the, conditions, in, which, they, attend, school, schools, in, poverty, stricken, areas, have, conditions, that, hinder, children, from, learning, in, a, safe, environment, researchers, have, developed, a, name, for, areas, like, this, an, urban, war, zone, is, a, poor, crime, laden, district, in, which, deteriorated, violent, even, warlike, conditions, and, underfunded, largely, ineffective, schools, promote, inferior, academic, performance, including, irregular, attendance, and, disruptive, or, non, compliant, classroom, behavior, because, of, poverty, students, from, low, income, families, are, 2, 4, times, more, likely, to, drop, out, than, middle, income, kids, and, over, 10, times, more, likely, than, high, income, peers, to, drop, out, for, children, with, low, resources, the, risk, factors, are, similar, to, others, such, as, juvenile, delinquency, rates, higher, levels, of, teenage, pregnancy, and, economic, dependency, upon, their, low, income, parent, or, parents, families, and, society, who, submit, low, levels, of, investment, in, the, education, and, development, of, less, fortunate, children, end, up, with, less, favorable, results, for, the, children, who, see, a, life, of, parental, employment, reduction, and, low, wages, higher, rates, of, early, childbearing, with, all, the, connected, risks, to, family, health, and, well, being, are, major, issues, to, address, since, education, from, preschool, to, high, school, is, identifiably, meaningful, in, a, life, poverty, often, drastically, affects, children, s, success, in, school, a, child, s, home, activities, preferences, mannerisms, must, align, with, the, world, and, in, the, cases, that, they, do, not, do, these, students, are, at, a, disadvantage, in, the, school, and, most, importantly, the, classroom, therefore, it, is, safe, to, state, that, children, who, live, at, or, below, the, poverty, level, will, have, far, less, success, educationally, than, children, who, live, above, the, poverty, line, poor, children, have, a, great, deal, less, healthcare, and, this, ultimately, results, in, many, absences, from, school, additionally, poor, children, are, much, more, likely, to, suffer, from, hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear, infections, flu, and, colds, these, illnesses, could, potentially, restrict, a, student, s, focus, and, concentration, in, general, the, interaction, of, gender, with, poverty, or, location, tends, to, work, to, the, disadvantage, of, girls, in, poorer, countries, with, low, completion, rates, and, social, expectations, that, they, marry, early, and, to, the, disadvantage, of, boys, in, richer, countries, with, high, completion, rates, but, social, expectations, that, they, enter, the, labour, force, early, at, the, primary, education, level, most, countries, with, a, completion, rate, below, 60, exhibit, gender, disparity, at, girls, expense, particularly, poor, and, rural, girls, in, mauritania, the, adjusted, gender, parity, index, is, 0, 86, on, average, but, only, 0, 63, for, the, poorest, 20, while, there, is, parity, among, the, richest, 20, in, countries, with, completion, rates, between, 60, and, 80, gender, disparity, is, generally, smaller, but, disparity, at, the, expense, of, poor, girls, is, especially, marked, in, cameroon, nigeria, and, yemen, exceptions, in, the, opposite, direction, are, observed, in, countries, with, pastoralist, economies, that, rely, on, boys, labour, such, as, the, kingdom, of, eswatini, lesotho, and, namibia, the, right, to, housing, is, argued, to, be, a, human, right, higher, density, and, lower, cost, housing, affords, low, income, families, and, first, time, homebuyers, with, more, and, less, expensive, shelter, opportunities, reducing, economic, inequality, the, geographic, concentration, of, poverty, is, argued, to, be, a, factor, in, entrenching, poverty, william, j, wilson, s, concentration, and, isolation, hypothesis, states, that, the, economic, difficulties, of, the, very, poorest, african, americans, are, compounded, by, the, fact, that, as, the, better, off, african, americans, move, out, the, poorest, are, more, and, more, concentrated, having, only, other, very, poor, people, as, neighbors, this, concentration, causes, social, isolation, wilson, suggests, because, the, very, poor, are, now, isolated, from, access, to, the, job, networks, role, models, institutions, and, other, connections, that, might, help, them, escape, poverty, gentrification, means, converting, an, aging, neighborhood, into, a, more, affluent, one, as, by, remodeling, homes, landlords, then, increase, rent, on, newly, renovated, real, estate, the, poor, people, cannot, afford, to, pay, high, rent, and, may, need, to, leave, their, neighborhood, to, find, affordable, housing, the, poor, also, get, more, access, to, income, and, services, while, studies, suggest, poor, residents, living, in, gentrifying, neighbourhoods, are, actually, less, likely, to, move, than, poor, residents, of, non, gentrifying, areas, poverty, increases, the, risk, of, homelessness, slum, dwellers, who, make, up, a, third, of, the, world, s, urban, population, live, in, a, poverty, no, better, if, not, worse, than, rural, people, who, are, the, traditional, focus, of, the, poverty, in, the, developing, world, according, to, a, report, by, the, united, nations, there, are, over, 100, million, street, children, worldwide, most, of, the, children, living, in, institutions, around, the, world, have, a, surviving, parent, or, close, relative, and, they, most, commonly, entered, orphanages, because, of, poverty, it, is, speculated, that, flush, with, money, for, profit, orphanages, are, increasing, and, push, for, children, to, join, even, though, demographic, data, show, that, even, the, poorest, extended, families, usually, take, in, children, whose, parents, have, died, many, child, advocates, maintain, that, this, can, harm, children, s, development, by, separating, them, from, their, families, and, that, it, would, be, more, effective, and, cheaper, to, aid, close, relatives, who, want, to, take, in, the, orphans, the, poor, tend, to, pay, more, for, access, to, utilities, and, ensuring, the, availability, of, water, sanitation, energy, and, telecommunication, services, such, as, broadband, internet, service, help, in, reducing, poverty, in, general, as, of, 2012, 2, 5, billion, people, lack, access, to, sanitation, services, and, 15, practice, open, defecation, even, while, providing, latrines, is, a, challenge, people, still, do, not, use, them, even, when, available, bangladesh, had, half, the, gdp, per, capita, of, india, but, has, a, lower, mortality, from, diarrhea, than, india, or, the, world, average, with, diarrhea, deaths, declining, by, 90, since, the, 1990s, by, strategically, providing, pit, latrines, to, the, poorest, charities, in, bangladesh, sparked, a, cultural, change, as, those, better, off, perceived, it, as, an, issue, of, status, to, not, use, one, the, vast, majority, of, the, latrines, built, were, then, not, from, charities, but, by, villagers, themselves, water, utility, subsidies, tend, to, subsidize, water, consumption, by, those, connected, to, the, supply, grid, which, is, typically, skewed, towards, the, richer, and, urban, segment, of, the, population, and, those, outside, informal, housing, as, a, result, of, heavy, consumption, subsidies, the, price, of, water, decreases, to, the, extent, that, only, 30, on, average, of, the, supplying, costs, in, developing, countries, is, covered, this, results, in, a, lack, of, incentive, to, maintain, delivery, systems, leading, to, losses, from, leaks, annually, that, are, enough, for, 200, million, people, this, also, leads, to, a, lack, of, incentive, to, invest, in, expanding, the, network, resulting, in, much, of, the, poor, population, being, unconnected, to, the, network, instead, the, poor, buy, water, from, water, vendors, for, on, average, about, 5, to, 16, times, the, metered, price, however, subsidies, for, laying, new, connections, to, the, network, rather, than, for, consumption, have, shown, more, promise, for, the, poor, in, developing, countries, and, some, areas, of, more, developed, countries, energy, poverty, is, lack, of, access, to, modern, energy, services, in, the, home, in, 2022, 759, million, people, lacked, access, to, consistent, electricity, and, 2, 6, billion, people, used, dangerous, and, inefficient, cooking, systems, their, well, being, is, negatively, affected, by, very, low, consumption, of, energy, use, of, dirty, or, polluting, fuels, and, excessive, time, spent, collecting, fuel, to, meet, basic, needs, predominant, indices, for, measuring, the, complex, nature, of, energy, poverty, include, the, energy, development, index, edi, the, multidimensional, energy, poverty, index, mepi, and, energy, poverty, index, epi, both, binary, and, multidimensional, measures, of, energy, poverty, are, required, to, establish, indicators, that, simplify, the, process, of, measuring, and, tracking, energy, poverty, globally, energy, poverty, often, exacerbates, existing, vulnerabilities, amongst, underprivileged, communities, and, negatively, impacts, public, and, household, health, education, and, women, s, opportunities, according, to, the, energy, poverty, action, initiative, of, the, world, economic, forum, access, to, energy, is, fundamental, to, improving, quality, of, life, and, is, a, key, imperative, for, economic, development, in, the, developing, world, energy, poverty, is, still, rife, as, a, result, of, this, situation, the, united, nations, un, launched, the, sustainable, energy, for, all, initiative, and, designated, 2012, as, the, international, year, for, sustainable, energy, for, all, which, had, a, major, focus, on, reducing, energy, poverty, for, low, income, individuals, and, families, access, to, credit, can, be, limited, predatory, or, both, making, it, difficult, to, find, the, financial, resources, they, need, to, invest, in, their, futures, cultural, factors, such, as, discrimination, of, various, kinds, can, negatively, affect, productivity, such, as, age, discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination, against, people, with, physical, disability, gender, discrimination, racial, discrimination, and, caste, discrimination, children, are, more, than, twice, as, likely, to, live, in, poverty, as, adults, women, are, the, group, suffering, from, the, highest, rate, of, poverty, after, children, in, what, is, referred, to, as, the, feminization, of, poverty, in, addition, the, fact, that, women, are, more, likely, to, be, caregivers, regardless, of, income, level, to, either, the, generations, before, or, after, them, exacerbates, the, burdens, of, their, poverty, those, in, poverty, have, increased, chances, of, incurring, a, disability, which, leads, to, a, cycle, where, disability, and, poverty, are, mutually, reinforcing, max, weber, and, some, schools, of, modernization, theory, suggest, that, cultural, values, could, affect, economic, success, however, researchers, have, gathered, evidence, that, suggest, that, values, are, not, as, deeply, ingrained, and, that, changing, economic, opportunities, explain, most, of, the, movement, into, and, out, of, poverty, as, opposed, to, shifts, in, values, a, 2018, report, on, poverty, in, the, united, states, by, un, special, rapporteur, philip, alston, asserts, that, caricatured, narratives, about, the, rich, and, the, poor, that, the, rich, are, industrious, entrepreneurial, patriotic, and, the, drivers, of, economic, success, while, the, poor, are, wasters, losers, and, scammers, are, largely, inaccurate, as, the, poor, are, overwhelmingly, those, born, into, poverty, or, those, thrust, there, by, circumstances, largely, beyond, their, control, such, as, physical, or, mental, disabilities, divorce, family, breakdown, illness, old, age, unlivable, wages, or, discrimination, in, the, job, market, societal, perception, of, people, experiencing, economic, difficulty, has, historically, appeared, as, a, conceptual, dichotomy, the, good, poor, people, who, are, physically, impaired, disabled, the, ill, and, incurable, the, elderly, pregnant, women, children, vs, the, bad, poor, able, bodied, valid, adults, most, often, male, according, to, experts, many, women, become, victims, of, trafficking, the, most, common, form, of, which, is, prostitution, as, a, means, of, survival, and, economic, desperation, deterioration, of, living, conditions, can, often, compel, children, to, abandon, school, to, contribute, to, the, family, income, putting, them, at, risk, of, being, exploited, for, example, in, zimbabwe, a, number, of, girls, are, turning, to, sex, in, return, for, food, to, survive, because, of, the, increasing, poverty, according, to, studies, as, poverty, decreases, there, will, be, fewer, and, fewer, instances, of, violence, some, data, such, as, the, unicef, reports, and, also, a, research, called, echo, of, silence, show, that, there, is, a, close, correlation, between, economic, poverty, and, early, marriage, in, some, developing, countries, child, marriage, is, considered, an, economic, measure, that, can, improve, the, family, s, poor, condition, strengthen, family, bonds, various, poverty, reduction, strategies, are, broadly, categorized, based, on, whether, they, make, more, of, the, basic, human, needs, available, or, whether, they, increase, the, disposable, income, needed, to, purchase, those, needs, some, strategies, such, as, building, roads, can, both, bring, access, to, various, basic, needs, such, as, fertilizer, or, healthcare, from, urban, areas, as, well, as, increase, incomes, by, bringing, better, access, to, urban, markets, reducing, relative, poverty, would, also, involve, reducing, inequality, oxfam, among, others, has, called, for, an, international, movement, to, end, extreme, wealth, concentration, arguing, that, the, concentration, of, resources, in, the, hands, of, the, top, 1, depresses, economic, activity, and, makes, life, harder, for, everyone, else, particularly, those, at, the, bottom, of, the, economic, ladder, and, they, say, that, the, gains, of, the, world, s, billionaires, in, 2017, which, amounted, to, 762, billion, were, enough, to, end, extreme, global, poverty, seven, times, over, methods, to, reduce, inequality, and, relative, poverty, include, progressive, taxation, which, involves, increasing, tax, rates, on, high, income, earners, wealth, taxes, which, involve, taxing, a, portion, of, an, individual, s, net, worth, above, a, certain, threshold, reducing, payroll, taxes, which, are, taxes, on, employees, and, employers, and, reducing, this, provides, workers, greater, take, home, pay, and, allows, employers, to, spend, more, on, wages, and, salaries, and, increasing, the, labor, share, which, is, the, proportion, of, business, income, paid, as, wages, and, salaries, instead, of, allocated, to, shareholders, as, profit, agricultural, technologies, such, as, nitrogen, fertilizers, pesticides, new, seed, varieties, and, new, irrigation, methods, have, dramatically, reduced, food, shortages, in, modern, times, by, boosting, yields, past, previous, constraints, before, the, industrial, revolution, poverty, had, been, mostly, accepted, as, inevitable, as, economies, produced, little, making, wealth, scarce, geoffrey, parker, wrote, that, in, antwerp, and, lyon, two, of, the, largest, cities, in, western, europe, by, 1600, three, quarters, of, the, total, population, were, too, poor, to, pay, taxes, and, therefore, likely, to, need, relief, in, times, of, crisis, the, initial, industrial, revolution, led, to, high, economic, growth, and, eliminated, mass, absolute, poverty, in, what, is, now, considered, the, developed, world, mass, production, of, goods, in, places, such, as, rapidly, industrializing, china, has, made, what, were, once, considered, luxuries, such, as, vehicles, and, computers, inexpensive, and, thus, accessible, to, many, who, were, otherwise, too, poor, to, afford, them, other, than, technology, advancements, in, sciences, such, as, medicine, help, provide, basic, needs, better, for, example, sri, lanka, had, a, maternal, mortality, rate, of, 2, in, the, 1930s, higher, than, any, nation, today, but, reduced, it, to, 0, 5, 0, 6, in, the, 1950s, and, to, 0, 6, in, 2006, while, spending, less, each, year, on, maternal, health, because, it, learned, what, worked, and, what, did, not, knowledge, on, the, cost, effectiveness, of, healthcare, interventions, can, be, elusive, and, educational, measures, have, been, made, to, disseminate, what, works, such, as, the, copenhagen, consensus, cheap, water, filters, and, promoting, hand, washing, are, some, of, the, most, cost, effective, health, interventions, and, can, cut, deaths, from, diarrhea, and, pneumonia, fortification, with, micronutrients, was, ranked, the, most, cost, effective, aid, strategy, by, the, copenhagen, consensus, for, example, iodised, salt, costs, 2, to, 3, cents, per, person, a, year, while, even, moderate, iodine, deficiency, in, pregnancy, shaves, off, 10, to, 15, iq, points, certain, basic, needs, are, argued, to, be, better, provided, by, the, state, universal, healthcare, can, reduce, the, overall, cost, of, providing, healthcare, by, having, a, single, payer, negotiating, with, healthcare, providers, and, minimizing, administrative, costs, it, is, also, argued, that, subsidizing, essential, goods, such, as, fuel, is, less, efficient, in, helping, the, poor, than, providing, that, same, money, as, income, grants, to, the, poor, government, revenue, can, be, diverted, away, from, basic, services, by, corruption, funds, from, aid, and, natural, resources, are, often, sent, by, government, individuals, for, money, laundering, to, overseas, banks, which, insist, on, bank, secrecy, instead, of, spending, on, the, poor, a, global, witness, report, asked, for, more, action, from, western, banks, as, they, have, proved, capable, of, stanching, the, flow, of, funds, linked, to, terrorism, illicit, capital, flight, such, as, corporate, tax, avoidance, from, the, developing, world, is, estimated, at, ten, times, the, size, of, aid, it, receives, and, twice, the, debt, service, it, pays, with, one, estimate, that, most, of, africa, would, be, developed, if, the, taxes, owed, were, paid, about, 60, per, cent, of, illicit, capital, flight, from, africa, is, from, transfer, mispricing, where, a, subsidiary, in, a, developing, nation, sells, to, another, subsidiary, or, shell, company, in, a, tax, haven, at, an, artificially, low, price, to, pay, less, tax, an, african, union, report, estimates, that, about, 30, of, sub, saharan, africa, s, gdp, has, been, moved, to, tax, havens, solutions, include, corporate, country, by, country, reporting, where, corporations, disclose, activities, in, each, country, and, thereby, prohibit, the, use, of, tax, havens, where, no, effective, economic, activity, occurs, developing, countries, debt, service, to, banks, and, governments, from, richer, countries, can, constrain, government, spending, on, the, poor, for, example, zambia, spent, 40, of, its, total, budget, to, repay, foreign, debt, and, only, 7, for, basic, state, services, in, 1997, one, of, the, proposed, ways, to, help, poor, countries, has, been, debt, relief, zambia, began, offering, services, such, as, free, health, care, even, while, overwhelming, the, health, care, infrastructure, because, of, savings, that, resulted, from, a, 2005, round, of, debt, relief, since, that, round, of, debt, relief, private, creditors, accounted, for, an, increasing, share, of, poor, countries, debt, service, obligations, this, complicated, efforts, to, renegotiate, easier, terms, for, borrowers, during, crises, such, as, the, covid, 19, pandemic, because, the, multiple, private, creditors, involved, say, they, have, a, fiduciary, obligation, to, their, clients, such, as, the, pension, funds, the, world, bank, and, the, international, monetary, fund, as, primary, holders, of, developing, countries, debt, attach, structural, adjustment, conditionalities, in, return, for, loans, which, are, generally, geared, toward, loan, repayment, with, austerity, measures, such, as, the, elimination, of, state, subsidies, and, the, privatization, of, state, services, for, example, the, world, bank, presses, poor, nations, to, eliminate, subsidies, for, fertilizer, even, while, many, farmers, cannot, afford, them, at, market, prices, in, malawi, almost, 5, million, of, its, 13, million, people, used, to, need, emergency, food, aid, but, after, the, government, changed, policy, and, subsidies, for, fertilizer, and, seed, were, introduced, farmers, produced, record, breaking, corn, harvests, in, 2006, and, 2007, as, malawi, became, a, major, food, exporter, distressed, securities, funds, also, known, as, vulture,

following, are, strategies, used, or, proposed, to, increase, personal, incomes, among, the, poor, raising, farm, incomes, is, described, as, the, core, of, the, antipoverty, effort, as, three, quarters, of, the, poor, today, are, farmers, estimates, show, that, growth, in, the, agricultural, productivity, of, small, farmers, is, on, average, at, least, twice, as, effective, in, benefiting, the, poorest, half, of, a, country, s, population, as, growth, generated, in, nonagricultural, sectors, a, guaranteed, minimum, income, ensures, that, every, citizen, will, be, able, to, purchase, a, desired, level, of, basic, needs, one, method, is, through, a, basic, income, or, negative, income, tax, which, is, a, system, of, social, security, that, periodically, provides, each, citizen, rich, or, poor, with, a, sum, of, money, that, is, sufficient, to, live, on, studies, of, large, cash, transfer, programs, in, ethiopia, kenya, and, malawi, show, that, the, programs, can, be, effective, in, increasing, consumption, schooling, and, nutrition, whether, they, are, tied, to, such, conditions, or, not, employment, subsidies, go, to, those, already, employed, and, this, has, shown, to, have, little, effect, on, those, at, the, lowest, income, levels, proponents, argue, that, a, basic, income, is, more, efficient, than, a, minimum, wage, and, unemployment, benefits, as, the, minimum, wage, effectively, imposes, a, high, marginal, tax, on, employers, causing, losses, in, efficiency, in, 1968, paul, samuelson, john, kenneth, galbraith, and, another, 1, 200, economists, signed, a, document, calling, for, the, us, congress, to, introduce, a, system, of, income, guarantees, winners, of, the, nobel, prize, in, economics, with, often, diverse, political, convictions, who, support, a, basic, income, include, herbert, a, simon, friedrich, hayek, robert, solow, milton, friedman, jan, tinbergen, james, tobin, and, james, meade, income, grants, are, argued, to, be, vastly, more, efficient, in, extending, basic, needs, to, the, poor, than, subsidizing, supplies, whose, effectiveness, in, poverty, alleviation, is, diluted, by, the, non, poor, who, enjoy, the, same, subsidized, prices, with, cars, and, other, appliances, the, wealthiest, 20, of, egypt, uses, about, 93, of, the, country, s, fuel, subsidies, in, some, countries, fuel, subsidies, are, a, larger, part, of, the, budget, than, health, and, education, a, 2008, study, concluded, that, the, money, spent, on, in, kind, transfers, in, india, in, a, year, could, lift, all, india, s, poor, out, of, poverty, for, that, year, if, transferred, directly, additionally, in, aid, models, the, famine, relief, model, increasingly, used, by, aid, groups, calls, for, giving, cash, or, cash, vouchers, to, the, hungry, to, pay, local, farmers, instead, of, buying, food, from, donor, countries, often, required, by, law, as, it, wastes, money, on, transport, costs, the, primary, obstacle, argued, against, direct, cash, transfers, is, the, impractically, for, poor, countries, of, such, large, and, direct, transfers, in, practice, payments, determined, by, complex, iris, scanning, are, used, by, war, torn, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, afghanistan, while, india, modified, its, subsidies, in, favor, of, direct, transfers, central, bank, digital, currencies, are, argued, to, be, an, efficient, tool, in, direct, cash, transfers, to, the, poor, as, it, can, reach, the, unbanked, and, be, more, cost, effective, without, having, to, physically, send, money, and, without, needing, an, intermediary, such, as, a, bank, corruption, often, leads, to, many, civil, services, being, treated, by, governments, as, employment, agencies, to, loyal, supporters, and, so, it, could, mean, going, through, 20, procedures, paying, 2, 696, in, fees, and, waiting, 82, business, days, to, start, a, business, in, bolivia, while, in, canada, it, takes, two, days, two, registration, procedures, and, 280, to, do, the, same, such, costly, barriers, favor, big, firms, at, the, expense, of, small, enterprises, where, most, jobs, are, created, often, businesses, have, to, bribe, government, officials, even, for, routine, activities, which, is, in, effect, a, tax, on, business, noted, reductions, in, poverty, in, recent, decades, has, occurred, in, china, and, india, mostly, as, a, result, of, the, abandonment, of, collective, farming, in, china, and, the, ending, of, the, central, planning, model, known, as, the, license, raj, in, india, the, world, bank, concludes, that, governments, and, feudal, elites, extending, to, the, poor, the, right, to, the, land, that, they, live, and, use, are, the, key, to, reducing, poverty, citing, that, land, rights, greatly, increase, poor, people, s, wealth, in, some, cases, doubling, it, providing, secure, tenure, to, land, ownership, creates, incentives, to, improve, the, land, and, thus, improves, the, welfare, of, the, poor, it, is, argued, that, those, in, power, have, an, incentive, to, not, secure, property, rights, as, they, are, able, to, then, more, easily, take, land, or, any, small, business, that, does, well, to, their, supporters, greater, access, to, markets, brings, more, income, to, the, poor, road, infrastructure, has, a, direct, impact, on, poverty, additionally, migration, from, poorer, countries, resulted, in, 328, billion, sent, from, richer, to, poorer, countries, in, 2010, more, than, double, the, 120, billion, in, official, aid, flows, from, oecd, members, in, 2011, india, got, 52, billion, from, its, diaspora, more, than, it, took, in, foreign, direct, investment, microloans, made, famous, by, the, grameen, bank, is, where, small, amounts, of, money, are, loaned, to, borrowers, who, typically, lack, collateral, steady, employment, or, a, verifiable, credit, history, however, microlending, has, been, criticized, for, making, hyperprofits, off, the, poor, even, from, its, founder, muhammad, yunus, and, in, india, arundhati, roy, asserts, that, some, 250, 000, debt, ridden, farmers, have, been, driven, to, suicide, those, in, poverty, place, more, importance, on, having, a, safe, place, to, save, money, than, on, receiving, loans, additionally, a, large, part, of, microfinance, loans, are, spent, not, on, investments, but, on, products, that, would, usually, be, paid, by, a, checking, or, savings, account, a, large, portion, of, the, poor, are, unbanked, because, it, is, often, not, profitable, to, open, bank, accounts, for, the, poor, one, altervative, option, is, the, postal, savings, system, another, option, is, mobile, banking, which, utilizes, the, wide, availability, of, mobile, phones, this, usually, involves, a, network, of, agents, of, mostly, shopkeepers, who, would, take, deposits, in, cash, and, translate, these, onto, an, account, on, customers, phones, cash, transfers, can, be, done, between, phones, and, issued, back, in, cash, with,

level, provides, children, from, low, income, families, who, may, not, otherwise, have, the, financial, resources, with, better, job, prospects, and, higher, earnings, and, promotes, social, mobility, job, training, and, vocational, education, programs, that, target, training, in, technical, skills, in, specific, industries, or, occupations, that, are, in, high, demand, can, reduce, poverty, and, wealth, concentration, strategies, to, provide, education, cost, effectively, include, deworming, children, which, costs, about, 50, cents, per, child, per, year, and, reduces, non, attendance, from, anemia, illness, and, malnutrition, while, being, only, a, twenty, fifth, as, expensive, as, increasing, school, attendance, by, constructing, schools, schoolgirl, absenteeism, could, be, cut, in, half, by, simply, providing, free, sanitary, towels, paying, for, school, meals, is, argued, to, be, an, efficient, strategy, in, increasing, school, enrollment, reducing, absenteeism, and, increasing, student, attention, desirable, actions, such, as, enrolling, children, in, school, or, receiving, vaccinations, can, be, encouraged, by, a, form, of, aid, known, as, conditional, cash, transfers, in, mexico, for, example, dropout, rates, of, 16, to, 19, year, olds, in, rural, area, dropped, by, 20, and, children, gained, half, an, inch, in, height, initial, fears, that, the, program, would, encourage, families, to, stay, at, home, rather, than, work, to, collect, benefits, have, proven, to, be, unfounded, instead, there, is, less, excuse, for, neglectful, behavior, as, for, example, children, stopped, begging, on, the, streets, instead, of, going, to, school, because, it, could, result, in, suspension, from, the, program, economist, william, easterly, diagnoses, a, problem, with, the, traditional, approach, to, poverty, reduction, whose, advocates, he, calls, planners, he, notes, that, 2, 3, trillion, were, spent, on, foreign, aid, in, five, decades, yet, twelve, cent, medicines, were, not, able, to, be, given, to, children, to, prevent, malaria, related, deaths, and, three, dollars, were, not, given, to, new, mothers, to, help, prevent, millions, of, child, deaths, he, argues, that, even, though, the, aid, was, well, meaning, it, failed, to, bring, results, because, planners, and, not, searchers, are, supplying, it, in, short, planners, are, not, able, to, motivate, people, to, carry, out, their, good, intentions, whereas, searchers, like, book, retailers, find, ways, to, make, things, work, in, 2015, all, un, member, states, adopted, the, 17, sustainable, development, goals, as, part, of, the, post, 2015, development, agenda, which, sought, to, create, a, future, global, development, framework, to, succeed, the, millennium, development, goals, which, were, goals, set, in, 2000, and, were, meant, to, be, achieved, by, 2015, most, targets, are, to, be, achieved, by, 2030, although, some, have, no, end, date, goal, 1, is, to, end, poverty, in, all, its, forms, everywhere, it, aims, to, eliminate, extreme, poverty, for, all, people, measured, by, daily, wages, less, than, 1, 25, and, at, least, half, the, total, number, of, men, women, and, children, living, in, poverty, in, addition, social, protection, systems, must, be, established, at, the, national, level, and, equal, access, to, economic, resources, must, be, ensured, strategies, have, to, be, developed, at, the, national, regional, and, international, levels, to, support, the, eradication, of, poverty, a, development, financial, institution, also, known, as, a, development, bank, is, a, financial, institution, that, provides, risk, capital, for, economic, development, projects, on, a, non, commercial, basis, they, are, often, established, and, owned, by, governments, to, finance, projects, that, would, otherwise, not, be, able, to, get, financing, from, commercial, lenders, these, include, international, financial, institutions, such, as, the, world, bank, which, is, the, largest, development, bank, in, recent, decades, the, number, of, nongovernmental, organizations, has, increased, dramatically, the, high, level, forums, on, aid, effectiveness, that, was, coordinated, by, the, oecd, found, that, this, leads, to, fragmentation, where, too, many, agencies, were, financing, too, many, small, projects, using, too, many, different, procedures, and, that, the, civil, service, of, the, donor, countries, were, overstretched, producing, reports, for, each, a, major, proportion, of, aid, from, donor, nations, is, tied, mandating, that, a, receiving, nation, spend, on, products, and, expertise, originating, only, from, the, donor, country, us, law, requires, food, aid, be, spent, on, buying, food, at, home, instead, of, where, the, hungry, live, and, as, a, result, half, of, what, is, spent, is, used, on, transport, domestic, ngos, have, more, expertise, in, their, respective, regions, and, have, less, overhead, and, thus, tend, to, be, more, efficient, in, delivering, aid, but, receive, less, funding, housing, only, for, a, western, aid, worker, in, ethiopia, is, enough, to, pay, the, salaries, of, four, or, five, local, ngo, workers, for, example, bilateral, government, aid, programs, such, as, us, agency, for, international, development, aim, to, increase, their, share, of, funding, to, go, through, local, partners, called, localizing, the, obstacles, include, accountability, where, it, is, easier, to, delegate, responsibility, for, spending, on, one, international, ngo, than, having, to, track, tax, payer, money, going, to, numerous, smaller, domestic, ngos, the, poverty, industrial, complex, refers, to, for, profit, companies, taking, over, roles, previously, held, by, government, agencies, the, incentive, for, profit, in, such, companies, has, been, argued, to, interfere, with, efficiently, providing, the, needed, services, aid, from, richer, nations, increasingly, go, through, for, profit, institutions, such, hospitals, are, found, to, imprison, patients, and, retain, corpses, for, non, payment, of, fees, the, cause, of, poverty, is, a, highly, ideologically, charged, subject, as, different, causes, point, to, different, remedies, very, broadly, speaking, the, socialist, tradition, locates, the, roots, of, poverty, in, problems, of, distribution, and, the, use, of, the, means, of, production, as, capital, benefiting, individuals, and, calls, for, redistribution, of, wealth, as, the, solution, whereas, the, neoliberal, school, of, thought, holds, that, creating, conditions, for, profitable, private, investment, is, the, solution, neoliberal, think, tanks, have, received, extensive, funding, and, proponents, of, neoliberalism, have, been, able, to, apply, their, ideas, in, highly, indebted, countries, in, the, global, south, as, a, condition, for, receiving, emergency, loans, from, the, international, monetary, fund, the, existence, of, inequality, is, in, part, due, to, a, set, of, self, reinforcing, behaviors, that, all, together, constitute, one, aspect, of, the, cycle, of, poverty, these, behaviors, in, addition, to, unfavorable, external, circumstances, also, explain, the, existence, of, the, matthew, effect, which, not, only, exacerbates, existing, inequality, but, is, more, likely, to, make, it, multigenerational, widespread, multigenerational, poverty, is, an, important, contributor, to, civil, unrest, and, political, instability, for, example, raghuram, g, rajan, former, governor, of, the, reserve, bank, of, india, and, former, chief, economist, at, the, international, monetary, fund, has, blamed, the, ever, widening, gulf, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, especially, in, the, us, to, be, one, of, the, main, fault, lines, which, caused, the, financial, institutions, to, pump, money, into, subprime, mortgages, on, political, behest, as, a, palliative, and, not, a, remedy, for, poverty, causing, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2009, in, rajan, s, view, the, main, cause, of, the, increasing, gap, between, high, income, and, low, income, earners, was, lack, of, equal, access, to, higher, education, for, the, latter, a, data, based, scientific, empirical, research, which, studied, the, impact, of, dynastic, politics, on, the, level, of, poverty, of, the, provinces, found, a, positive, correlation, between, dynastic, politics, and, poverty, i, e, the, higher, proportion, of, dynastic, politicians, in, power, in, a, province, leads, to, higher, poverty, rate, there, is, significant, evidence, that, these, political, dynasties, use, their, political, dominance, over, their, respective, regions, to, enrich, themselves, using, methods, such, as, graft, or, outright, bribery, of, legislators, most, economic, historians, believe, that, throughout, most, of, human, history, extreme, poverty, was, the, norm, for, roughly, 90, of, the, population, and, only, with, the, emergence, of, industrialization, in, the, 19th, century, were, the, masses, of, people, lifted, out, of, it, 1, this, narrative, is, advanced, by, among, others, martin, ravallion, nicholas, kristof, and, steven, pinker, some, academics, including, dylan, sullivan, and, jason, hickel, have, challenged, this, contemporary, mainstream, narrative, on, poverty, arguing, that, extreme, poverty, was, not, the, norm, throughout, human, history, but, emerged, during, periods, of, severe, social, and, economic, dislocation, including, high, european, feudalism, and, the, apex, of, the, roman, empire, and, that, it, expanded, significantly, after, 1500, with, the, emergence, of, colonialism, and, the, beginnings, of, capitalism, stating, that, the, expansion, of, the, capitalist, world, system, caused, a, dramatic, and, prolonged, process, of, impoverishment, on, a, scale, unparalleled, in, recorded, history, sullivan, and, hickel, assert, that, only, with, the, rise, of, anti, colonial, and, socialist, political, movements, in, the, 20th, century, did, human, welfare, begin, to, see, significant, improvement, however, all, scholars, and, intellectuals, including, hickel, agree, that, the, incomes, of, the, poorest, people, in, the, world, have, increased, since, 1981, nevertheless, sullivan, and, hickel, argue, that, poverty, persists, under, contemporary, global, capitalism, in, spite, of, it, being, highly, productive, because, masses, of, working, people, are, cut, off, from, common, land, and, resources, have, no, ownership, or, control, over, the, means, of, production, and, have, their, labor, power, appropriated, by, a, ruling, class, or, an, external, imperial, power, thereby, maintaining, extreme, inequality, marian, l, tupy, a, senior, fellow, of, the, cato, institute, a, right, libertarian, think, tank, criticized, hickel, s, claim, that, people, before, industrialization, lived, well, without, a, lot, of, monetary, income, stating, that, the, evidence, from, contemporary, accounts, and, academic, research, shows, that, compared, to, today, western, european, living, standards, prior, to, industrialization, were, miserably, low, that, poverty, was, widespread, and, it, was, precisely, the, onset, of, industrialization, and, global, trade, which, led, to, poverty, alleviation, first, in, the, west, and, then, in, the, rest, and, that, both, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, while, advocating, for, socialism, recognized, that, the, capitalist, system, developing, around, them, had, improved, people, s, material, conditions, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, poverty, is, a, violation, of, human, rights, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, state, that, everyone, as, a, member, of, society, has, the, right, to, social, security, the, poor, tend, to, suffer, most, from, environmental, degradation, caused, by, reckless, exploitation, of, natural, resources, by, the, rich, for, example, it, is, estimated, that, 92, of, accumulated, greenhouse, gas, emissions, can, be, attributed, to, countries, from, the, global, north, while, 8, of, emissions, are, attributed, to, countries, from, the, global, south, however, developing, countries, suffer, 99, of, the, casualties, attributable, to, climate, change, this, unfair, distribution, of, environmental, burdens, and, benefits, has, generated, the, global, environmental, justice, and, climate, justice, movement, the, brundtland, report, concluded, that, poverty, causes, environmental, degradation, while, other, theories, like, environmentalism, of, the, poor, conclude, that, the, global, poor, may, be, the, most, important, force, for, sustainability, a, 2013, world, bank, report, estimated, that, climate, change, was, likely, to, hinder, future, attempts, to, reduce, poverty, with, a, 2016, un, report, claiming, that, by, 2030, an, additional, 122, million, more, people, could, be, driven, to, extreme, poverty, because, of, climate, change, the, possible, impacts, of, a, temperature, rise, of, 2, c, include, regular, food, shortages, in, sub, saharan, africa, a, deficiency, in, water, availability, with, droughts, predicted, to, happen, much, faster, and, last, longer, degradation, and, loss, of, reefs, in, south, east, asia, resulting, in, reduced, fish, stocks, and, coastal, communities, and, cities, more, vulnerable, to, increasingly, violent, storms, green, imperialism, is, the, term, used, to, refer, to, influencing, poorer, nations, in, the, name, of, environmentalism, green, colonialism, is, grabbing, of, land, in, the, name, of, environmentalism, fortress, conservation, is, the, conservation, model, based, on, the, belief, that, biodiversity, protection, is, best, achieved, by, creating, protected, areas, in, isolation, from, humans, and, this, has, led, to, the, eviction, of, indigenous, people, among, some, individuals, poverty, is, considered, a, necessary, or, desirable, condition, which, must, be, embraced, to, reach, certain, spiritual, moral, or, intellectual, states, poverty, is, often, understood, to, be, an, essential, element, of, renunciation, in, religions, such, as, buddhism, hinduism, only, for, monks, not, for, lay, persons, and, jainism, whilst, in, christianity, in, particular, roman, catholicism, it, is, one, of, the, evangelical, counsels, some, christian, communities, such, as, the, simple, way, the, bruderhof, and, the, amish, value, voluntary, poverty, some, even, take, a, vow, of, poverty, similar, to, that, of, the, traditional, catholic, orders, in, order, to, live, a, more, complete, life, of, discipleship, another, example, is, mendicancy, where, one, chooses, to, rely, chiefly, or, exclusively, on, alms, to, survive, the, main, aim, of, giving, up, things, of, the, materialistic, world, is, to, withdraw, oneself, from, sensual, pleasures, as, they, are, considered, illusionary, and, only, temporary, in, some, religions, such, as, the, concept, of, dunya, in, islam, pope, paul, vi, referred, to, the, spirit, of, poverty, as, a, fundamental, characteristic, of, a, christian, life, while, pope, benedict, xvi, distinguished, between, poverty, chosen, the, poverty, of, spirit, proposed, by, jesus, and, poverty, to, be, fought, unjust, and, imposed, poverty, voluntary, poverty, can, also, be, the, result, of, solidarity, with, the, poor, benedict, xvi, considered, that, such, solidarity, is, a, necessary, condition, to, fight, effectively, to, eradicate, the, non, voluntary, poverty
