marxism, is, a, political, philosophy, and, method, of, socioeconomic, analysis, it, uses, a, dialectical, materialist, interpretation, of, historical, development, better, known, as, historical, materialism, to, analyse, class, relations, social, conflict, and, social, transformation, marxism, originates, with, the, works, of, 19th, century, german, philosophers, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, marxism, has, developed, over, time, into, various, branches, and, schools, of, thought, and, as, a, result, there, is, no, single, definitive, marxist, theory, marxism, has, had, a, profound, effect, in, shaping, the, modern, world, with, various, left, wing, and, far, left, political, movements, taking, inspiration, from, it, in, varying, local, contexts, in, addition, to, the, various, schools, of, thought, which, emphasise, or, modify, elements, of, classical, marxism, several, marxian, concepts, have, been, incorporated, into, an, array, of, social, theories, this, has, led, to, widely, varying, conclusions, alongside, marx, s, critique, of, political, economy, the, defining, characteristics, of, marxism, have, often, been, described, using, the, terms, dialectical, materialism, and, historical, materialism, though, these, terms, were, coined, after, marx, s, death, and, their, tenets, have, been, challenged, by, some, self, described, marxists, as, a, school, of, thought, marxism, has, had, a, profound, effect, on, society, and, global, academia, to, date, it, has, influenced, many, fields, including, anthropology, archaeology, art, theory, criminology, cultural, studies, economics, education, ethics, film, theory, geography, historiography, literary, criticism, media, studies, philosophy, political, science, political, economy, psychology, science, studies, sociology, urban, planning, and, theatre, marxism, seeks, to, explain, social, phenomena, within, any, given, society, by, analysing, the, material, conditions, and, economic, activities, required, to, fulfill, human, material, needs, it, assumes, that, the, form, of, economic, organisation, or, mode, of, production, influences, all, other, social, phenomena, including, broader, social, relations, political, institutions, legal, systems, cultural, systems, aesthetics, and, ideologies, these, social, relations, and, the, economic, system, form, a, base, and, superstructure, as, forces, of, production, i, e, technology, improve, existing, forms, of, organising, production, become, obsolete, and, hinder, further, progress, karl, marx, wrote, at, a, certain, stage, of, development, the, material, productive, forces, of, society, come, into, conflict, with, the, existing, relations, of, production, or, this, merely, expresses, the, same, thing, in, legal, terms, with, the, property, relations, within, the, framework, of, which, they, have, operated, hitherto, from, forms, of, development, of, the, productive, forces, these, relations, turn, into, their, fetters, then, begins, an, era, of, social, revolution, these, inefficiencies, manifest, themselves, as, social, contradictions, in, society, which, are, in, turn, fought, out, at, the, level, of, class, struggle, under, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, this, struggle, materialises, between, the, minority, who, own, the, means, of, production, the, bourgeoisie, and, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, who, produce, goods, and, services, the, proletariat, starting, with, the, conjectural, premise, that, social, change, occurs, due, to, the, struggle, between, different, classes, within, society, who, contradict, one, another, a, marxist, would, conclude, that, capitalism, exploits, and, oppresses, the, proletariat, therefore, capitalism, will, inevitably, lead, to, a, proletarian, revolution, in, a, socialist, society, private, property, as, the, means, of, production, would, be, replaced, by, cooperative, ownership, a, socialist, economy, would, not, base, production, on, the, creation, of, private, profits, but, on, the, criteria, of, satisfying, human, needs, that, is, production, for, use, friedrich, engels, explained, that, the, capitalist, mode, of, appropriation, in, which, the, product, enslaves, first, the, producer, and, then, the, appropriator, is, replaced, by, the, mode, of, appropriation, of, the, products, that, is, based, upon, the, nature, of, the, modern, means, of, production, upon, the, one, hand, direct, social, appropriation, as, means, to, the, maintenance, and, extension, of, production, on, the, other, direct, individual, appropriation, as, means, of, subsistence, and, of, enjoyment, marxian, economics, and, its, proponents, view, capitalism, as, economically, unsustainable, and, incapable, of, improving, the, population, s, living, standards, due, to, its, need, to, compensate, for, the, falling, rate, of, profit, by, cutting, employees, wages, and, social, benefits, while, pursuing, military, aggression, the, socialist, mode, of, production, would, succeed, capitalism, as, humanity, s, mode, of, production, through, revolution, by, workers, according, to, marxian, crisis, theory, socialism, is, not, an, inevitability, but, an, economic, necessity, the, term, marxism, was, popularised, by, karl, kautsky, who, considered, himself, an, orthodox, marxist, during, the, dispute, between, marx, s, orthodox, and, revisionist, followers, kautsky, s, revisionist, rival, eduard, bernstein, also, later, adopted, the, term, engels, did, not, support, using, marxism, to, describe, either, marx, s, or, his, views, he, claimed, that, the, term, was, being, abusively, used, as, a, rhetorical, qualifier, by, those, attempting, to, cast, themselves, as, genuine, followers, of, marx, while, casting, others, in, different, terms, such, as, lassallians, in, 1882, engels, claimed, that, marx, had, criticised, self, proclaimed, marxist, paul, lafargue, by, saying, that, if, lafargue, s, views, were, considered, marxist, then, one, thing, is, certain, and, that, is, that, i, am, not, a, marxist, the, discovery, of, the, materialist, conception, of, history, or, rather, the, consistent, continuation, and, extension, of, materialism, into, the, domain, of, social, phenomenon, removed, two, chief, defects, of, earlier, historical, theories, in, the, first, place, they, at, best, examined, only, the, ideological, motives, of, the, historical, activity, of, human, beings, without, grasping, the, objective, laws, governing, the, development, of, the, system, of, social, relations, in, the, second, place, the, earlier, theories, did, not, cover, the, activities, of, the, masses, of, the, population, whereas, historical, materialism, made, it, possible, for, the, first, time, to, study, with, scientific, accuracy, the, social, conditions, of, the, life, of, the, masses, and, the, changes, in, these, conditions, russian, marxist, theoretician, and, revolutionary, vladimir, lenin, 1913, society, does, not, consist, of, individuals, but, expresses, the, sum, of, interrelations, the, relations, within, which, these, individuals, stand, marxism, uses, a, materialist, methodology, referred, to, by, marx, and, engels, as, the, materialist, conception, of, history, and, later, better, known, as, historical, materialism, to, analyse, the, underlying, causes, of, societal, development, and, change, from, the, perspective, of, the, collective, ways, in, which, humans, make, their, living, marx, s, account, of, the, theory, is, in, the, german, ideology, 1845, and, the, preface, a, contribution, to, the, critique, of, political, economy, 1859, all, constituent, features, of, a, society, social, classes, political, pyramid, and, ideologies, are, assumed, to, stem, from, economic, activity, forming, what, is, considered, the, base, and, superstructure, the, base, and, superstructure, metaphor, describes, the, totality, of, social, relations, by, which, humans, produce, and, re, produce, their, social, existence, according, to, marx, the, sum, total, of, the, forces, of, production, accessible, to, men, determines, the, condition, of, society, and, forms, a, society, s, economic, base, the, base, includes, the, material, forces, of, production, such, as, the, labour, means, of, production, and, relations, of, production, i, e, the, social, and, political, arrangements, that, regulate, production, and, distribution, from, this, base, rises, a, superstructure, of, legal, and, political, forms, of, social, consciousness, that, derive, from, the, economic, base, that, conditions, both, the, superstructure, and, the, dominant, ideology, of, a, society, conflicts, between, the, development, of, material, productive, forces, and, the, relations, of, production, provoke, social, revolutions, whereby, changes, to, the, economic, base, lead, to, the, superstructure, s, social, transformation, this, relationship, is, reflexive, in, that, the, base, initially, gives, rise, to, the, superstructure, and, remains, the, foundation, of, a, form, of, social, organisation, those, newly, formed, social, organisations, can, then, act, again, upon, both, parts, of, the, base, and, superstructure, so, that, rather, than, being, static, the, relationship, is, dialectic, expressed, and, driven, by, conflicts, and, contradictions, engels, clarified, the, history, of, all, hitherto, existing, society, is, the, history, of, class, struggles, freeman, and, slave, patrician, and, plebeian, lord, and, serf, guild, master, and, journeyman, in, a, word, oppressor, and, oppressed, stood, in, constant, opposition, to, one, another, carried, on, uninterrupted, now, hidden, now, open, fight, a, fight, that, each, time, ended, either, in, a, revolutionary, reconstitution, of, society, at, large, or, in, the, common, ruin, of, the, contending, classes, marx, considered, recurring, class, conflicts, as, the, driving, force, of, human, history, as, such, conflicts, have, manifested, as, distinct, transitional, stages, of, development, in, western, europe, accordingly, marx, designated, human, history, as, encompassing, four, stages, of, development, in, relations, of, production, while, historical, materialism, has, been, referred, to, as, a, materialist, theory, of, history, marx, did, not, claim, to, have, produced, a, master, key, to, history, and, that, the, materialist, conception, of, history, is, not, an, historico, philosophic, theory, of, the, marche, g, n, rale, imposed, by, fate, upon, every, people, whatever, the, historic, circumstances, in, which, it, finds, itself, in, a, letter, to, the, editor, of, the, russian, newspaper, paper, otechestvennyje, zapiski, 1877, he, explained, that, his, ideas, were, based, upon, a, concrete, study, of, the, actual, conditions, in, europe, according, to, the, marxist, theoretician, and, revolutionary, socialist, vladimir, lenin, the, principal, content, of, marxism, was, marx, s, economic, doctrine, marx, demonstrated, how, the, capitalist, bourgeoisie, and, their, economists, were, promoting, what, he, saw, as, the, lie, that, the, interests, of, the, capitalist, and, of, the, worker, are, one, and, the, same, he, believed, that, they, did, this, by, purporting, the, concept, that, the, fastest, possible, growth, of, productive, capital, was, best, for, wealthy, capitalists, and, workers, because, it, provided, them, with, employment, exploitation, is, a, matter, of, surplus, labour, the, amount, of, labour, performed, beyond, what, is, received, in, goods, exploitation, has, been, a, socioeconomic, feature, of, every, class, society, and, is, one, of, the, principal, features, distinguishing, the, social, classes, the, power, of, one, social, class, to, control, the, means, of, production, enables, its, exploitation, of, other, classes, under, capitalism, the, labour, theory, of, value, is, the, operative, concern, whereby, the, value, of, a, commodity, equals, the, socially, necessary, labour, time, required, to, produce, it, under, such, conditions, surplus, value, the, difference, between, the, value, produced, and, the, value, received, by, a, labourer, is, synonymous, with, surplus, labour, and, capitalist, exploitation, is, thus, realised, as, deriving, surplus, value, from, the, worker, in, pre, capitalist, economies, exploitation, of, the, worker, was, achieved, via, physical, coercion, under, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, workers, do, not, own, the, means, of, production, and, must, voluntarily, enter, into, an, exploitative, work, relationship, with, a, capitalist, to, earn, the, necessities, of, life, the, worker, s, entry, into, such, employment, is, voluntary, because, they, choose, which, capitalist, to, work, for, however, the, worker, must, work, or, starve, thus, exploitation, is, inevitable, and, the, voluntary, nature, of, a, worker, participating, in, a, capitalist, society, is, illusory, it, is, production, not, circulation, that, causes, exploitation, marx, emphasised, that, capitalism, per, se, does, not, cheat, the, worker, alienation, german, entfremdung, is, the, estrangement, of, people, from, their, humanity, and, a, systematic, result, of, capitalism, under, capitalism, the, fruits, of, production, belong, to, employers, who, expropriate, the, surplus, created, by, others, and, generate, alienated, labourers, in, marx, s, view, alienation, is, an, objective, characterisation, of, the, worker, s, situation, in, capitalism, his, or, her, self, awareness, of, this, condition, is, not, prerequisite, in, addition, to, criticism, marx, has, also, praised, some, of, the, results, of, capitalism, stating, that, it, has, created, more, massive, and, more, colossal, productive, forces, than, have, all, preceding, generations, together, and, that, it, has, put, an, end, to, all, feudal, patriarchal, arrangements, marx, posited, that, the, remaining, feudalist, societies, in, the, world, and, forms, of, socialism, that, did, not, conform, with, his, writings, would, be, replaced, by, communism, in, the, future, in, a, similar, manner, as, with, capitalism, marx, distinguishes, social, classes, based, on, two, criteria, i, e, ownership, of, means, of, production, and, control, over, the, labour, power, of, others, following, this, criterion, of, class, based, on, property, relations, marx, identified, the, social, stratification, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, with, the, following, social, groups, class, consciousness, denotes, the, awareness, of, itself, and, the, social, world, that, a, social, class, possesses, and, its, capacity, to, act, rationally, in, its, best, interests, class, consciousness, is, required, before, a, social, class, can, effect, a, successful, revolution, and, thus, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, without, defining, ideology, marx, used, the, term, to, describe, the, production, of, images, of, social, reality, according, to, engels, ideology, is, a, process, accomplished, by, the, so, called, thinker, consciously, it, is, true, but, with, a, false, consciousness, the, real, motive, forces, impelling, him, remain, unknown, to, him, otherwise, it, simply, would, not, be, an, ideological, process, hence, he, imagines, false, or, seeming, motive, forces, because, the, ruling, class, controls, the, society, s, means, of, production, the, superstructure, of, society, i, e, the, ruling, social, ideas, is, determined, by, the, best, interests, of, the, ruling, class, in, the, german, ideology, marx, says, that, he, ideas, of, the, ruling, class, are, in, every, epoch, the, ruling, ideas, i, e, the, class, which, is, the, ruling, material, force, of, society, is, at, the, same, time, its, ruling, intellectual, force, the, term, political, economy, initially, referred, to, the, study, of, the, material, conditions, of, economic, production, in, the, capitalist, system, in, marxism, political, economy, is, the, study, of, the, means, of, production, specifically, of, capital, and, how, that, manifests, as, economic, activity, marxism, taught, me, what, society, was, i, was, like, a, blindfolded, man, in, a, forest, who, doesn, t, even, know, where, north, or, south, is, if, you, don, t, eventually, come, to, truly, understand, the, history, of, the, class, struggle, or, at, least, have, a, clear, idea, that, society, is, divided, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, and, that, some, people, subjugate, and, exploit, other, people, you, re, lost, in, a, forest, not, knowing, anything, cuban, revolutionary, and, marxist, leninist, politician, fidel, castro, on, discovering, marxism, 2009, this, new, way, of, thinking, was, invented, because, socialists, believed, that, common, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, i, e, the, industries, land, wealth, of, nature, trade, apparatus, and, wealth, of, the, society, would, abolish, the, exploitative, working, conditions, experienced, under, capitalism, through, working, class, revolution, the, state, which, marxists, saw, as, a, weapon, for, the, subjugation, of, one, class, by, another, is, seized, and, used, to, suppress, the, hitherto, ruling, class, of, capitalists, and, by, implementing, a, commonly, owned, democratically, controlled, workplace, create, the, society, of, communism, which, marxists, see, as, true, democracy, an, economy, based, on, cooperation, on, human, need, and, social, betterment, rather, than, competition, for, profit, of, many, independently, acting, profit, seekers, would, also, be, the, end, of, class, society, which, marx, saw, as, the, fundamental, division, of, all, hitherto, existing, history, marx, saw, the, fundamental, nature, of, capitalist, society, as, little, different, from, that, of, a, slave, society, in, that, one, small, group, of, society, exploits, the, larger, group, through, common, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, the, profit, motive, is, eliminated, and, the, motive, of, furthering, human, flourishing, is, introduced, because, the, surplus, produced, by, the, workers, is, the, property, of, the, society, as, a, whole, there, are, no, classes, of, producers, and, appropriators, additionally, as, the, state, originates, in, the, bands, of, retainers, hired, by, the, first, ruling, classes, to, protect, their, economic, privilege, it, will, wither, away, as, its, conditions, of, existence, have, disappeared, according, to, the, oxford, handbook, of, karl, marx, marx, used, many, terms, to, refer, to, a, post, capitalist, society, positive, humanism, socialism, communism, realm, of, free, individuality, free, association, of, producers, etc, he, used, these, terms, completely, interchangeably, the, notion, that, socialism, and, communism, are, distinct, historical, stages, is, alien, to, his, work, and, only, entered, the, lexicon, of, marxism, after, his, death, according, to, orthodox, marxist, theory, overthrowing, capitalism, by, a, socialist, revolution, in, contemporary, society, is, inevitable, while, the, inevitability, of, an, eventual, socialist, revolution, is, a, controversial, debate, among, many, different, marxist, schools, of, thought, all, marxists, believe, socialism, is, a, necessity, marxists, argue, that, a, socialist, society, is, far, better, for, most, of, the, populace, than, its, capitalist, counterpart, prior, to, the, russian, revolution, vladimir, lenin, wrote, the, socialisation, of, production, is, bound, to, lead, to, the, conversion, of, the, means, of, production, into, the, property, of, society, this, conversion, will, directly, result, in, an, immense, increase, in, productivity, of, labour, a, reduction, of, working, hours, and, the, replacement, of, the, remnants, the, ruins, of, small, scale, primitive, disunited, production, by, collective, and, improved, labour, the, failure, of, the, 1905, russian, revolution, along, with, the, failure, of, socialist, movements, to, resist, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, led, to, renewed, theoretical, effort, and, valuable, contributions, from, lenin, and, rosa, luxemburg, towards, an, appreciation, of, marx, s, crisis, theory, and, efforts, to, formulate, a, theory, of, imperialism, karl, marx, criticised, liberal, democracy, as, not, democratic, enough, due, to, the, unequal, socio, economic, situation, of, the, workers, during, the, industrial, revolution, which, undermines, the, democratic, agency, of, citizens, marxists, differ, in, their, positions, towards, democracy, types, of, democracy, in, marxism, include, soviet, democracy, new, democracy, whole, process, people, s, democracy, and, can, include, voting, on, how, surplus, labour, is, to, be, organised, according, to, democratic, centralism, political, decisions, reached, by, voting, in, the, party, are, binding, for, all, members, of, the, party, classical, marxism, denotes, the, collection, of, socio, eco, political, theories, expounded, by, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, as, ernest, mandel, remarked, marxism, is, always, open, always, critical, always, self, critical, classical, marxism, distinguishes, marxism, as, broadly, perceived, from, what, marx, believed, in, 1883, marx, wrote, to, his, son, in, law, paul, lafargue, and, french, labour, leader, jules, guesde, both, of, whom, claimed, to, represent, marxist, principles, accusing, them, of, revolutionary, phrase, mongering, and, denying, the, value, of, reformist, struggle, from, marx, s, letter, derives, marx, s, famous, remark, that, if, their, politics, represented, marxism, ce, qu, il, y, a, de, certain, c, est, que, moi, je, ne, suis, pas, marxiste, what, is, certain, is, that, i, myself, am, not, a, marxist, libertarian, marxism, emphasises, the, anti, authoritarian, and, libertarian, aspects, of, marxism, early, currents, of, libertarian, marxism, such, as, left, communism, emerged, in, opposition, to, marxism, leninism, libertarian, marxism, is, often, critical, of, reformist, positions, such, as, those, held, by, social, democrats, libertarian, marxist, currents, often, draw, from, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, later, works, specifically, the, grundrisse, and, the, civil, war, in, france, emphasising, the, marxist, belief, in, the, ability, of, the, working, class, to, forge, its, destiny, without, the, need, for, a, vanguard, party, to, mediate, or, aid, its, liberation, along, with, anarchism, libertarian, marxism, is, one, of, the, main, currents, of, libertarian, socialism, libertarian, marxism, includes, currents, such, as, autonomism, council, communism, de, leonism, lettrism, parts, of, the, new, left, situationism, freudo, marxism, a, form, of, psychoanalysis, socialisme, ou, barbarie, and, workerism, libertarian, marxism, has, often, strongly, influenced, both, post, left, and, social, anarchists, notable, theorists, of, libertarian, marxism, have, included, maurice, brinton, cornelius, castoriadis, guy, debord, raya, dunayevskaya, daniel, gu, rin, c, l, r, james, rosa, luxemburg, antonio, negri, anton, pannekoek, fredy, perlman, ernesto, screpanti, e, p, thompson, raoul, vaneigem, and, yanis, varoufakis, the, latter, claiming, that, marx, himself, was, a, libertarian, marxist, marxist, humanism, was, born, in, 1932, with, the, publication, of, marx, s, economic, and, philosophic, manuscripts, of, 1844, and, reached, a, degree, of, prominence, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, marxist, humanists, contend, that, there, is, continuity, between, the, early, philosophical, writings, of, marx, in, which, he, develops, his, theory, of, alienation, and, the, structural, description, of, capitalist, society, found, in, his, later, works, such, as, capital, they, hold, that, grasping, marx, s, philosophical, foundations, is, necessary, to, understand, his, later, works, properly, contrary, to, the, official, dialectical, materialism, of, the, soviet, union, and, interpretations, of, marx, rooted, in, the, structural, marxism, of, louis, althusser, marxist, humanists, argue, that, marx, s, work, was, an, extension, or, transcendence, of, enlightenment, humanism, whereas, other, marxist, philosophies, see, marxism, as, natural, science, marxist, humanism, reaffirms, the, doctrine, that, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, that, humans, are, essentially, different, to, the, rest, of, the, natural, order, and, should, be, treated, so, by, marxist, theory, according, to, a, 2007, survey, of, american, professors, by, neil, gross, and, solon, simmons, 17, 6, of, social, science, professors, and, 5, 0, of, humanities, professors, identify, as, marxists, while, between, 0, and, 2, of, professors, in, all, other, disciplines, identify, as, marxists, the, theoretical, development, of, marxist, archaeology, was, first, developed, in, the, soviet, union, in, 1929, when, a, young, archaeologist, named, vladislav, i, ravdonikas, published, a, report, entitled, for, a, soviet, history, of, material, culture, within, this, work, the, very, discipline, of, archaeology, as, it, then, stood, was, criticised, as, being, inherently, bourgeois, therefore, anti, socialist, and, so, as, a, part, of, the, academic, reforms, instituted, in, the, soviet, union, under, the, administration, of, general, secretary, joseph, stalin, a, great, emphasis, was, placed, on, the, adoption, of, marxist, archaeology, throughout, the, country, these, theoretical, developments, were, subsequently, adopted, by, archaeologists, working, in, capitalist, states, outside, of, the, leninist, bloc, most, notably, by, the, australian, academic, v, gordon, childe, who, used, marxist, theory, in, his, understandings, of, the, development, of, human, society, marxist, sociology, as, the, study, of, sociology, from, a, marxist, perspective, is, a, form, of, conflict, theory, associated, with, marxism, s, objective, of, developing, a, positive, empirical, science, of, capitalist, society, as, part, of, the, mobilisation, of, a, revolutionary, working, class, the, american, sociological, association, has, a, section, dedicated, to, the, issues, of, marxist, sociology, that, is, interested, in, examining, how, insights, from, marxist, methodology, and, marxist, analysis, can, help, explain, the, complex, dynamics, of, modern, society, influenced, by, the, thought, of, karl, marx, marxist, sociology, emerged, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, with, marx, max, weber, and, mile, durkheim, are, considered, seminal, influences, in, early, sociology, the, first, marxist, school, of, sociology, was, known, as, austro, marxism, of, which, carl, gr, nberg, and, antonio, labriola, were, among, its, most, notable, members, during, the, 1940s, the, western, marxist, school, became, accepted, within, western, academia, subsequently, fracturing, into, several, different, perspectives, such, as, the, frankfurt, school, or, critical, theory, the, legacy, of, critical, theory, as, a, major, offshoot, of, marxism, is, controversial, the, common, thread, linking, marxism, and, critical, theory, is, an, interest, in, struggles, to, dismantle, structures, of, oppression, exclusion, and, domination, due, to, its, former, state, supported, position, there, has, been, a, backlash, against, marxist, thought, in, post, communist, states, such, as, poland, however, it, remains, prominent, in, the, sociological, research, sanctioned, and, supported, by, communist, states, such, as, in, china, marxian, economics, is, a, school, of, economic, thought, tracing, its, foundations,

january, 2007, venezuelan, trotskyist, organisations, do, not, regard, ch, vez, as, a, trotskyist, with, some, describing, him, as, a, bourgeois, nationalist, while, others, consider, him, an, honest,

communism, this, new, weak, communism, differs, substantially, from, its, previous, soviet, and, current, chinese, realisation, because, the, south, american, countries, follow, democratic, electoral,

is, not, only, because, of, media, distortions, but, also, for, the, alternative, it, represents, through, the, same, democratic, procedures, that, the, west, constantly, professes, to, cherish, but,

event, celebrating, the, 200th, anniversary, of, marx, s, birth, xi, said, we, must, win, the, advantages, win, the, initiative, and, win, the, future, we, must, continuously, improve, the, ability, to, use, marxism, to, analyse, and, solve, practical, problems, adding, that, marxism, is, a, powerful, ideological, weapon, for, us, to, understand, the, world, grasp, the, law, seek, the, truth, and, change, the, world, xi, has, further, stressed, the, importance, of, examining, and, continuing, the, tradition, of, the, cpc, and, embracing, its, revolutionary, past, the, fidelity, of, those, varied, revolutionaries, leaders, and, parties, to, the, work, of, karl, marx, is, highly, contested, and, has, been, rejected, by, many, marxists, and, other, socialists, alike, socialists, in, general, and, socialist, writers, including, dimitri, volkogonov, acknowledge, that, the, actions, of, authoritarian, socialist, leaders, have, damaged, the, enormous, appeal, of, socialism, generated, by, the, october, revolution, criticism, of, marxism, has, come, from, various, political, ideologies, and, academic, disciplines, this, includes, general, criticism, about, lack, of, internal, consistency, criticisms, related, to, historical, materialism, that, it, is, a, type, of, historical, determinism, the, necessity, of, suppression, of, individual, rights, issues, with, the, implementation, of, communism, and, economic, issues, such, as, the, distortion, or, absence, of, price, signals, and, reduced, incentives, in, addition, empirical, and, epistemological, problems, are, frequently, identified, some, marxists, have, criticised, the, academic, institutionalisation, of, marxism, for, being, too, shallow, and, detached, from, political, action, zimbabwean, trotskyist, alex, callinicos, himself, a, professional, academic, stated, its, practitioners, remind, one, of, narcissus, who, in, the, greek, legend, fell, in, love, with, his, own, reflection, sometimes, it, is, necessary, to, devote, time, to, clarifying, and, developing, the, concepts, that, we, use, but, indeed, for, western, marxists, this, has, become, an, end, in, itself, the, result, is, a, body, of, writings, incomprehensible, to, all, but, a, tiny, minority, of, highly, qualified, scholars, additionally, some, intellectual, critiques, of, marxism, contest, certain, assumptions, prevalent, in, marx, s, thought, and, marxism, after, him, without, rejecting, marxist, politics, other, contemporary, supporters, of, marxism, argue, that, many, aspects, of, marxist, thought, are, viable, but, that, the, corpus, is, incomplete, or, outdated, regarding, certain, aspects, of, economic, political, or, social, theory, they, may, combine, some, marxist, concepts, with, the, ideas, of, other, theorists, such, as, max, weber, the, frankfurt, school, is, one, example, philosopher, and, historian, of, ideas, leszek, ko, akowski, pointed, out, that, marx, s, theory, is, incomplete, or, ambiguous, in, many, places, and, could, be, applied, in, many, contradictory, ways, without, manifestly, infringing, its, principles, specifically, he, considers, the, laws, of, dialectics, as, fundamentally, erroneous, stating, that, some, are, truisms, with, no, specific, marxist, content, others, philosophical, dogmas, that, cannot, be, proved, by, scientific, means, and, some, just, nonsense, he, believes, that, some, marxist, laws, can, be, interpreted, differently, but, that, these, interpretations, still, in, general, fall, into, one, of, the, two, categories, of, error, okishio, s, theorem, shows, that, if, capitalists, use, cost, cutting, techniques, and, real, wages, do, not, increase, the, rate, of, profit, must, rise, which, casts, doubt, on, marx, s, view, that, the, rate, of, profit, would, tend, to, fall, the, allegations, of, inconsistency, have, been, a, large, part, of, marxian, economics, and, the, debates, around, it, since, the, 1970s, andrew, kliman, argues, that, this, undermines, marx, s, critiques, and, the, correction, of, the, alleged, inconsistencies, because, internally, inconsistent, theories, cannot, be, correct, by, definition, critics, of, marxism, claim, that, marx, s, predictions, have, failed, with, some, pointing, towards, the, gdp, per, capita, generally, increasing, in, capitalist, economies, compared, to, less, market, oriented, economics, the, capitalist, economies, not, suffering, worsening, economic, crises, leading, to, the, overthrow, of, the, capitalist, system, and, communist, revolutions, not, occurring, in, the, most, advanced, capitalist, nations, but, instead, in, undeveloped, regions, it, has, also, been, criticised, for, allegedly, resulting, in, lower, living, standards, in, relation, to, capitalist, countries, a, claim, that, has, been, disputed, in, his, books, the, poverty, of, historicism, and, conjectures, and, refutations, philosopher, of, science, karl, popper, criticised, the, explanatory, power, and, validity, of, historical, materialism, popper, believed, that, marxism, had, been, initially, scientific, in, that, marx, had, postulated, a, genuinely, predictive, theory, when, these, predictions, were, not, borne, out, popper, argues, that, the, theory, avoided, falsification, by, adding, ad, hoc, hypotheses, that, made, it, compatible, with, the, facts, because, of, this, popper, asserted, a, theory, that, was, initially, genuinely, scientific, degenerated, into, pseudoscientific, dogma, anarchism, has, had, a, strained, relationship, with, marxism, anarchists, and, many, non, marxist, libertarian, socialists, reject, the, need, for, a, transitory, state, phase, claiming, that, socialism, can, only, be, established, through, decentralised, non, coercive, organisation, anarchist, mikhail, bakunin, criticised, marx, for, his, authoritarian, bent, the, phrases, barracks, socialism, or, barracks, communism, became, shorthand, for, this, critique, evoking, the, image, of, citizens, lives, being, as, regimented, as, the, lives, of, conscripts, in, barracks, other, critiques, come, from, an, economic, standpoint, vladimir, karpovich, dmitriev, writing, in, 1898, ladislaus, von, bortkiewicz, writing, in, 1906, 1907, and, subsequent, critics, have, alleged, that, marx, s, value, theory, and, the, law, of, the, tendency, of, the, rate, of, profit, to, fall, are, internally, inconsistent, in, other, words, the, critics, allege, that, marx, drew, conclusions, that, do, not, follow, his, theoretical, premises, once, these, alleged, errors, are, corrected, his, conclusion, that, aggregate, price, and, profit, are, determined, by, and, equal, to, the, aggregate, value, and, surplus, value, no, longer, holds, this, result, calls, into, question, his, theory, that, exploiting, workers, is, the, sole, source, of, profit, marxism, and, socialism, have, received, considerable, critical, analysis, from, multiple, generations, of, austrian, economists, regarding, scientific, methodology, economic, theory, and, political, implications, during, the, marginal, revolution, a, theory, of, subjective, value, was, developed, by, carl, menger, with, scholars, viewing, the, development, of, marginalism, more, broadly, as, a, response, to, marxist, economics, second, generation, austrian, economist, eugen, b, hm, von, bawerk, used, praxeological, and, subjectivist, methodology, to, fundamentally, attack, the, law, of, value, gottfried, haberler, has, regarded, his, criticism, as, definitive, arguing, that, b, hm, bawerk, s, critique, of, marx, s, economics, was, so, thorough, and, devastating, that, he, believes, that, as, of, the, 1960s, no, marxian, scholar, had, conclusively, refuted, it, third, generation, austrian, ludwig, von, mises, rekindled, the, debate, about, the, economic, calculation, problem, by, arguing, that, without, price, signals, in, capital, goods, in, his, opinion, all, other, aspects, of, the, market, economy, are, irrational, this, led, him, to, declare, that, rational, economic, activity, is, impossible, in, a, socialist, commonwealth, daron, acemoglu, and, james, a, robinson, argue, that, marx, s, economic, theory, was, fundamentally, flawed, because, it, attempted, to, simplify, the, economy, into, a, few, general, laws, that, ignored, the, impact, of, institutions, on, the, economy, these, charges, have, been, disputed, by, other, influential, economists, like, john, roemer, and, nicholas, vrousalis
