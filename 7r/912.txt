individual, units, and, sometimes, individual, soldiers, within, a, unit, some, of, the, groupings, common, to, all, armies, include, the, following, the, battle, of, the, ten, kings, a, hindu, aryan, king, named, sudas, defeated, an, alliance, of, ten, kings, and, their, supportive, chieftains, during, the, iron, age, the, maurya, and, nanda, empires, had, the, one, of, the, largest, armies, in, the, world, the, peak, being, approximately, over, 600, 000, infantry, 30, 000, cavalry, 8, 000, war, chariots, and, 9, 000, war, elephants, not, including, tributary, state, allies, in, the, gupta,

armies, for, at, least, 1000, years, before, the, spring, and, autumn, annals, by, the, warring, states, period, the, crossbow, had, been, perfected, enough, to, become, a, military, secret, with, bronze, bolts, that, could, pierce, any, armor, thus, any, political, power, of, a, state, rested, on, the, armies, and, their, organization, china, underwent, political, consolidation, of, the, states, of, han, wei, chu, yan, zhao, and, qi, until, by, 221, bce, qin, shi, huang, the, first, emperor, of, the, qin, dynasty, attained, absolute, power, this, first, emperor, of, china, could, command, the, creation, of, a, terracotta, army, to, guard, his, tomb, in, the, city, of, xi, an, as, well, as, a, realignment, of, the, great, wall, of, china, to, strengthen, his, empire, against, insurrection, invasion, and, incursion, sun, tzu, s, the, art, of, war, remains, one, of, china, s, seven, military, classics, even, though, it, is, two, thousand, years, old, since, no, political, figure, could, exist, without, an, army, measures, were, taken, to, ensure, only, the, most, capable, leaders, could, control, the, armies, civil, bureaucracies, arose, to, control, the, productive, power, of, the, states, and, their, military, power, the, spartan, army, was, one, of, the, earliest, known, professional, armies, boys, were, sent, to, a, barracks, at, the, age, of, seven, or, eight, to, train, for, becoming, a, soldier, at, the, age, of, thirty, they, were, released, from, the, barracks, and, allowed, to, marry, and, have, a, family, after, that, men, devoted, their, lives, to, war, until, their, retirement, at, the, age, of, 60, the, spartan, army, was, largely, composed, of, hoplites, equipped, with, arms, and, armor, nearly, identical, to, each, other, each, hoplite, bore, the, spartan, emblem, and, a, scarlet, uniform, the, main, pieces, of, this, armor, were, a, round, shield, a, spear, and, a, helmet, the, roman, army, had, its, origins, in, the, citizen, army, of, the, republic, which, was, staffed, by, citizens, serving, mandatory, duty, for, rome, conscription, remained, the, main, method, through, which, rome, mustered, forces, until, the, end, of, the, republic, the, army, eventually, became, a, professional, organization, largely, of, citizens, who, would, served, continuously, for, 25, years, before, being, discharged, the, romans, were, also, noted, for, making, use, of, auxiliary, troops, non, romans, who, served, with, the, legions, and, filled, roles, that, the, traditional, roman, military, could, not, fill, effectively, such, as, light, skirmish, troops, and, heavy, cavalry, after, their, service, in, the, army, they, were, made, citizens, of, rome, and, then, their, children, were, citizens, also, they, were, also, given, land, and, money, to, settle, in, rome, in, the, late, roman, empire, these, auxiliary, troops, along, with, foreign, mercenaries, became, the, core, of, the, roman, army, moreover, by, the, time, of, the, late, roman, empire, tribes, such, as, the, visigoths, were, paid, to, serve, as, mercenaries, in, the, earliest, middle, ages, it, was, the, obligation, of, every, aristocrat, to, respond, to, the, call, to, battle, with, his, own, equipment, archers, and, infantry, this, decentralized, system, was, necessary, due, to, the, social, order, of, the, time, but, could, lead, to, motley, forces, with, variable, training, equipment, and, abilities, the, more, resources, the, noble, had, access, to, the, better, his, troops, would, be, initially, the, words, knight, and, noble, were, used, interchangeably, as, there, was, not, generally, a, distinction, between, them, while, the, nobility, did, fight, upon, horseback, they, were, also, supported, by, lower, class, citizens, and, mercenaries, and, criminals, whose, only, purpose, was, participating, in, warfare, because, most, often, than, not, they, held, brief, employment, during, their, lord, s, engagement, as, the, middle, ages, progressed, and, feudalism, developed, in, a, legitimate, social, and, economic, system, knights, started, to, develop, into, their, own, class, with, a, minor, caveat, they, were, still, in, debt, to, their, lord, no, longer, primarily, driven, by, economic, need, the, newly, established, vassal, class, were, instead, driven, by, fealty, and, chivalry, as, central, governments, grew, in, power, a, return, to, the, citizen, armies, of, the, classical, period, also, began, as, central, levies, of, the, peasantry, began, to, be, the, central, recruiting, tool, england, was, one, of, the, most, centralized, states, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, armies, that, fought, in, the, hundred, years, war, were, predominantly, composed, of, paid, professionals, in, theory, every, englishman, had, an, obligation, to, serve, for, forty, days, forty, days, was, not, long, enough, for, a, campaign, especially, one, on, the, continent, thus, the, scutage, was, introduced, whereby, most, englishmen, paid, to, escape, their, service, and, this, money, was, used, to, create, a, permanent, army, however, almost, all, high, medieval, armies, in, europe, were, composed, of, a, great, deal, of, paid, core, troops, and, there, was, a, large, mercenary, market, in, europe, from, at, least, the, early, 12th, century, as, the, middle, ages, progressed, in, italy, italian, cities, began, to, rely, mostly, on, mercenaries, to, do, their, fighting, rather, than, the, militias, that, had, dominated, the, early, and, high, medieval, period, in, this, region, these, would, be, groups, of, career, soldiers, who, would, be, paid, a, set, rate, mercenaries, tended, to, be, effective, soldiers, especially, in, combination, with, standing, forces, but, in, italy, they, came, to, dominate, the, armies, of, the, city, states, this, made, them, considerably, less, reliable, than, a, standing, army, mercenary, on, mercenary, warfare, in, italy, also, led, to, relatively, bloodless, campaigns, which, relied, as, much, on, maneuver, as, on, battles, in, 1439, the, french, legislature, known, as, the, estates, general, french, tats, g, n, raux, passed, laws, that, restricted, military, recruitment, and, training, to, the, king, alone, there, was, a, new, tax, to, be, raised, known, as, the, taille, that, was, to, provide, funding, for, a, new, royal, army, the, mercenary, companies, were, given, a, choice, of, either, joining, the, royal, army, as, compagnies, d, ordonnance, on, a, permanent, basis, or, being, hunted, down, and, destroyed, if, they, refused, france, gained, a, total, standing, army, of, around, 6, 000, men, which, was, sent, out, to, gradually, eliminate, the, remaining, mercenaries, who, insisted, on, operating, on, their, own, the, new, standing, army, had, a, more, disciplined, and, professional, approach, to, warfare, than, its, predecessors, the, reforms, of, the, 1440s, eventually, led, to, the, french, victory, at, castillon, in, 1453, and, the, conclusion, of, the, hundred, years, war, by, 1450, the, companies, were, divided, into, the, field, army, known, as, the, grande, ordonnance, and, the, garrison, force, known, as, the, petite, ordonnance, first, nation, states, lacked, the, funds, needed, to, maintain, standing, forces, so, they, tended, to, hire, mercenaries, to, serve, in, their, armies, during, wartime, such, mercenaries, typically, formed, at, the, ends, of, periods, of, conflict, when, men, at, arms, were, no, longer, needed, by, their, respective, governments, the, veteran, soldiers, thus, looked, for, other, forms, of, employment, often, becoming, mercenaries, free, companies, would, often, specialize, in, forms, of, combat, that, required, longer, periods, of, training, that, was, not, available, in, the, form, of, a, mobilized, militia, as, late, as, the, 1650s, most, troops, were, mercenaries, however, after, the, 17th, century, most, states, invested, in, better, disciplined, and, more, politically, reliable, permanent, troops, for, a, time, mercenaries, became, important, as, trainers, and, administrators, but, soon, these, tasks, were, also, taken, by, the, state, the, massive, size, of, these, armies, required, a, large, supporting, force, of, administrators, the, newly, centralized, states, were, forced, to, set, up, vast, organized, bureaucracies, to, manage, these, armies, which, some, historians, argue, is, the, basis, of, the, modern, bureaucratic, state, the, combination, of, increased, taxes, and, increased, centralization, of, government, functions, caused, a, series, of, revolts, across, europe, such, as, the, fronde, in, france, and, the, english, civil, war, in, many, countries, the, resolution, of, this, conflict, was, the, rise, of, absolute, monarchy, only, in, england, and, the, netherlands, did, representative, government, evolve, as, an, alternative, from, the, late, 17th, century, states, learned, how, to, finance, wars, through, long, term, low, interest, loans, from, national, banking, institutions, the, first, state, to, master, this, process, was, the, dutch, republic, this, transformation, in, the, armies, of, europe, had, great, social, impact, the, defense, of, the, state, now, rested, on, the, commoners, not, on, the, aristocrats, however, aristocrats, continued, to, monopolize, the, officer, corps, of, almost, all, early, modern, armies, including, their, high, command, moreover, popular, revolts, almost, always, failed, unless, they, had, the, support, and, patronage, of, the, noble, or, gentry, classes, the, new, armies, because, of, their, vast, expense, were, also, dependent, on, taxation, and, the, commercial, classes, who, also, began, to, demand, a, greater, role, in, society, the, great, commercial, powers, of, the, dutch, and, english, matched, much, larger, states, in, military, might, as, any, man, could, be, quickly, trained, in, the, use, of, a, musket, it, became, far, easier, to, form, massive, armies, the, inaccuracy, of, the, weapons, necessitated, large, groups, of, massed, soldiers, this, led, to, a, rapid, swelling, of, the, size, of, armies, for, the, first, time, huge, masses, of, the, population, could, enter, combat, rather, than, just, the, highly, skilled, professionals, it, has, been, argued, that, the, drawing, of, men, from, across, the, nation, into, an, organized, corps, helped, breed, national, unity, and, patriotism, and, during, this, period, the, modern, notion, of, the, nation, state, was, born, however, this, would, only, become, apparent, after, the, french, revolutionary, wars, at, this, time, the, lev, e, en, masse, and, conscription, would, become, the, defining, paradigm, of, modern, warfare, before, then, however, most, national, armies, were, in, fact, composed, of, many, nationalities, in, spain, armies, were, recruited, from, all, the, spanish, european, territories, including, spain, italy, wallonia, walloon, guards, and, germany, the, french, recruited, some, soldiers, from, germany, switzerland, as, well, as, from, piedmont, britain, recruited, hessian, and, hanovrian, troops, until, the, late, 18th, century, irish, catholics, made, careers, for, themselves, in, the, armies, of, many, catholic, european, states, prior, to, the, english, civil, war, in, england, the, monarch, maintained, a, personal, bodyguard, of, yeomen, of, the, guard, and, the, honourable, corps, of, gentlemen, at, arms, or, gentlemen, pensioners, and, a, few, locally, raised, companies, to, garrison, important, places, such, as, berwick, on, tweed, or, portsmouth, or, calais, before, it, was, recaptured, by, france, in, 1558, troops, for, foreign, expeditions, were, raised, upon, an, ad, hoc, basis, noblemen, and, professional, regular, soldiers, were, commissioned, by, the, monarch, to, supply, troops, raising, their, quotas, by, indenture, from, a, variety, of, sources, on, january, 26, 1661, charles, ii, issued, the, royal, warrant, that, created, the, genesis, of, what, would, become, the, british, army, although, the, scottish, and, english, armies, would, remain, two, separate, organizations, until, the, unification, of, england, and, scotland, in, 1707, the, small, force, was, represented, by, only, a, few, regiments, after, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, continental, army, was, quickly, disbanded, as, part, of, the, americans, distrust, of, standing, armies, and, irregular, state, militias, became, the, sole, ground, army, of, the, united, states, with, the, exception, of, one, battery, of, artillery, guarding, west, point, s, arsenal, then, first, american, regiment, was, established, in, 1784, however, because, of, continuing, conflict, with, native, americans, it, was, soon, realized, that, it, was, necessary, to, field, a, trained, standing, army, the, first, of, these, the, legion, of, the, united, states, was, established, in, 1791, until, 1733, the, common, soldiers, of, prussian, army, consisted, largely, of, peasantry, recruited, or, impressed, from, brandenburg, prussia, leading, many, to, flee, to, neighboring, countries, to, halt, this, trend, frederick, william, i, divided, prussia, into, regimental, cantons, every, youth, was, required, to, serve, as, a, soldier, in, these, recruitment, districts, for, three, months, each, year, this, met, agrarian, needs, and, added, extra, troops, to, bolster, the, regular, ranks, russian, tsars, before, peter, i, of, russia, maintained, professional, hereditary, musketeer, corps, streltsy, in, russian, that, were, highly, unreliable, and, undisciplined, in, times, of, war, the, armed, forces, were, augmented, by, peasants, peter, i, introduced, a, modern, regular, army, built, on, german, model, but, with, a, new, aspect, officers, not, necessarily, from, nobility, as, talented, commoners, were, given, promotions, that, eventually, included, a, noble, title, at, the, attainment, of, an, officer, s, rank, conscription, of, peasants, and, townspeople, was, based, on, quota, system, per, settlement, initially, it, was, based, on, the, number, of, households, later, it, was, based, on, the, population, numbers, the, term, of, service, in, the, 18th, century, was, for, life, in, 1793, it, was, reduced, to, 25, years, in, 1834, it, was, reduced, to, 20, years, plus, 5, years, in, reserve, and, in, 1855, to, 12, years, plus, 3, years, of, reserve, the, first, ottoman, standing, army, were, janissaries, they, replaced, forces, that, mostly, comprised, tribal, warriors, ghazis, whose, loyalty, and, morale, could, not, always, be, trusted, the, first, janissary, units, were, formed, from, prisoners, of, war, and, slaves, probably, as, a, result, of, the, sultan, taking, his, traditional, one, fifth, share, of, his, army, s, treasure, they, looted, in, kind, rather, than, cash, from, the, 1380s, onwards, their, ranks, were, filled,

armies, conscription, particularly, when, the, conscripts, are, being, sent, to, foreign, wars, that, do, not, directly, affect, the, security, of, the, nation, has, historically, been, highly, politically, contentious, in, democracies, in, developed, nations, the, increasing, emphasis, on, technological, firepower, and, better, trained, fighting, forces, make, mass, conscription, unlikely, in, the, foreseeable, future, russia, as, well, as, many, other, nations, retains, mainly, a, conscript, army, there, is, also, a, very, rare, citizen, army, as, used, in, switzerland, see, military,
