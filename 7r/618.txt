a, television, broadcaster, or, television, network, is, a, telecommunications, network, for, the, distribution, of, television, content, where, a, central, operation, provides, programming, to, many, television, stations, pay, television, providers, or, in, the, united, states, multichannel, video, programming, distributors, until, the, mid, 1980s, broadcast, programming, on, television, in, most, countries, of, the, world, was, dominated, by, a, small, number, of, terrestrial, networks, many, early, television, networks, such, as, the, bbc, cbc, pbs, ptv, nbc, or, abc, in, the, us, and, in, australia, evolved, from, earlier, radio, networks, in, countries, where, most, networks, broadcast, identical, centrally, originated, content, to, all, of, their, stations, and, where, most, individual, television, transmitters, therefore, operate, only, as, large, repeater, stations, the, terms, television, network, television, channel, a, numeric, identifier, or, radio, frequency, and, television, station, have, become, mostly, interchangeable, in, everyday, language, with, professionals, in, television, related, occupations, continuing, to, make, a, differentiation, between, them, within, the, industry, a, tiering, is, sometimes, created, among, groups, of, networks, based, on, whether, their, programming, is, simultaneously, originated, from, a, central, point, and, whether, the, network, master, control, has, the, technical, and, administrative, capability, to, take, over, the, programming, of, their, affiliates, in, real, time, when, it, deems, this, necessary, the, most, common, example, being, during, national, breaking, news, events, in, north, america, in, particular, many, television, networks, available, via, cable, and, satellite, television, are, branded, as, channels, because, they, are, somewhat, different, from, traditional, networks, in, the, sense, defined, above, as, they, are, singular, operations, they, have, no, affiliates, or, component, stations, but, instead, are, distributed, to, the, public, via, cable, or, direct, broadcast, satellite, providers, such, networks, are, commonly, referred, to, by, terms, such, as, specialty, channels, in, canada, or, cable, networks, in, the, u, s, a, network, may, or, may, not, produce, all, of, its, own, programming, if, not, production, companies, such, as, warner, bros, television, universal, television, sony, pictures, television, and, tristar, television, can, distribute, their, content, to, the, various, networks, and, it, is, common, that, a, certain, production, firm, may, have, programs, that, air, on, two, or, more, rival, networks, similarly, some, networks, may, import, television, programs, from, other, countries, or, use, archived, programming, to, help, complement, their, schedules, some, stations, have, the, capability, to, interrupt, the, network, through, the, local, insertion, of, television, commercials, station, identifications, and, emergency, alerts, others, completely, break, away, from, the, network, for, their, own, programming, a, method, known, as, regional, variation, this, is, common, where, small, networks, are, members, of, larger, networks, the, majority, of, commercial, television, stations, are, self, owned, even, though, a, variety, of, these, instances, are, the, property, of, an, owned, and, operated, television, network, the, commercial, television, stations, can, also, be, linked, with, a, noncommercial, educational, broadcasting, agency, some, countries, have, launched, national, television, networks, so, that, individual, television, stations, can, act, as, common, repeaters, of, nationwide, programs, on, the, other, hand, television, networks, also, undergo, the, impending, experience, of, major, changes, related, to, cultural, varieties, the, emergence, of, cable, television, has, made, available, in, major, media, markets, programs, such, as, those, aimed, at, american, bi, cultural, latinos, such, a, diverse, captive, audience, presents, an, occasion, for, the, networks, and, affiliates, to, advertise, the, best, programming, that, needs, to, be, aired, this, is, explained, by, author, tim, p, vos, in, his, abstract, a, cultural, explanation, of, early, broadcast, where, he, determines, targeted, group, non, targeted, group, representations, as, well, as, the, cultural, specificity, employed, in, the, television, network, entity, vos, notes, that, policymakers, did, not, expressly, intend, to, create, a, broadcast, order, dominated, by, commercial, networks, in, fact, legislative, attempts, were, made, to, limit, the, network, s, preferred, position, as, to, individual, stations, modern, network, operations, centers, usually, use, broadcast, automation, to, handle, most, tasks, these, systems, are, not, only, used, for, programming, and, for, video, server, playout, but, use, exact, atomic, time, from, global, positioning, systems, or, other, sources, to, maintain, perfect, synchronization, with, upstream, and, downstream, systems, so, that, programming, appears, seamless, to, viewers, a, major, international, television, broadcaster, is, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, bbc, which, is, perhaps, most, well, known, for, its, news, agency, bbc, news, owned, by, the, crown, the, bbc, funds, itself, in, two, ways, uk, services, branded, under, bbc, are, funded, by, the, television, license, paid, by, british, residents, as, a, result, no, advertising, appears, on, these, services, the, advertising, funded, arm, bbc, studios, employs, 23, 000, people, worldwide, including, the, operation, of, broadcaster, uktv, in, the, uk, itself, experimental, television, broadcasts, were, started, in, 1929, using, an, electromechanical, 30, line, system, developed, by, john, logie, baird, limited, regular, broadcasts, using, this, system, began, in, 1934, and, an, expanded, service, now, known, as, bbc, television, started, from, alexandra, palace, in, november, 1936, television, in, the, united, states, had, long, been, dominated, by, the, big, three, television, networks, the, american, broadcasting, company, abc, cbs, formerly, the, columbia, broadcasting, system, and, the, national, broadcasting, company, nbc, however, the, fox, broadcasting, company, fox, which, launched, in, october, 1986, has, gained, prominence, and, is, now, considered, part, of, the, big, four, the, big, three, provide, a, significant, number, of, programs, to, each, of, their, affiliates, including, newscasts, prime, time, daytime, and, sports, programming, but, still, reserve, periods, during, each, day, where, their, affiliate, can, air, local, programming, such, as, local, news, or, syndicated, programs, since, the, creation, of, fox, the, number, of, american, television, networks, has, increased, though, the, amount, of, programming, they, provide, is, often, much, less, for, example, the, cw, only, provides, fifteen, hours, of, primetime, programming, each, week, along, with, three, hours, on, saturdays, while, mynetworktv, only, provides, ten, hours, of, primetime, programming, each, week, leaving, their, affiliates, to, fill, time, periods, where, network, programs, are, not, broadcast, with, a, large, amount, of, syndicated, programming, other, networks, are, dedicated, to, specialized, programming, such, as, religious, content, or, programs, presented, in, languages, other, than, english, particularly, spanish, the, largest, television, network, in, the, united, states, however, is, the, public, broadcasting, service, pbs, a, non, profit, publicly, owned, non, commercial, educational, service, in, comparison, to, the, commercial, television, networks, there, is, no, central, unified, arm, of, broadcast, programming, meaning, that, each, pbs, member, station, has, a, significant, amount, of, freedom, to, schedule, television, shows, as, they, consent, to, some, public, television, outlets, such, as, pbs, carry, separate, digital, subchannel, networks, through, their, member, stations, for, example, georgia, public, broadcasting, in, fact, some, programs, airing, on, pbs, were, branded, on, other, channels, as, coming, from, gpb, kids, and, pbs, world, this, works, as, each, network, sends, its, signal, to, many, local, affiliated, television, stations, across, the, country, these, local, stations, then, carry, the, network, feed, which, can, be, viewed, by, millions, of, households, across, the, country, in, such, cases, the, signal, is, sent, to, as, many, as, 200, stations, or, as, little, as, just, a, dozen, or, fewer, stations, depending, on, the, size, of, the, network, with, the, adoption, of, digital, television, television, networks, have, also, been, created, specifically, for, distribution, on, the, digital, subchannels, of, television, stations, including, networks, focusing, on, classic, television, series, and, films, operated, by, companies, like, weigel, broadcasting, owners, of, movies, and, me, tv, and, nexstar, media, group, owners, of, rewind, tv, and, antenna, tv, along, with, networks, focusing, on, music, sports, and, other, niche, programming, cable, and, satellite, providers, pay, the, networks, a, certain, rate, per, subscriber, the, highest, charge, being, for, espn, in, which, cable, and, satellite, providers, pay, a, rate, of, more, than, 5, 00, per, subscriber, to, espn, the, providers, also, handle, the, sale, of, advertising, inserted, at, the, local, level, during, national, programming, in, which, case, the, broadcaster, and, the, cable, satellite, provider, may, share, revenue, networks, that, maintain, a, home, shopping, or, infomercial, format, may, instead, pay, the, station, or, cable, satellite, provider, in, a, brokered, carriage, deal, this, is, especially, common, with, low, power, television, stations, and, in, recent, years, even, more, so, for, stations, that, used, this, revenue, stream, to, finance, their, conversion, to, digital, broadcasts, which, in, turn, provides, them, with, several, additional, channels, to, transmit, different, programming, sources, television, broadcasting, in, the, united, states, was, heavily, influenced, by, radio, early, individual, experimental, radio, stations, in, the, united, states, began, limited, operations, in, the, 1910s, in, november, 1920, westinghouse, signed, on, the, world, s, first, commercially, licensed, radio, station, kdka, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, other, companies, built, early, radio, stations, in, detroit, boston, new, york, city, and, other, areas, radio, stations, received, permission, to, transmit, through, broadcast, licenses, obtained, through, the, federal, radio, commission, frc, a, government, entity, that, was, created, in, 1926, to, regulate, the, radio, industry, with, some, exceptions, radio, stations, east, of, the, mississippi, river, received, official, call, signs, beginning, with, the, letter, w, those, west, of, the, mississippi, were, assigned, calls, beginning, with, a, k, the, number, of, programs, that, these, early, stations, aired, was, often, limited, in, part, due, to, the, expense, of, program, creation, the, idea, of, a, network, system, which, would, distribute, programming, to, many, stations, simultaneously, saving, each, station, the, expense, of, creating, all, of, their, own, programs, and, expanding, the, total, coverage, beyond, the, limits, of, a, single, broadcast, signal, was, devised, nbc, set, up, the, first, permanent, coast, to, coast, radio, network, in, the, united, states, by, 1928, using, dedicated, telephone, line, technology, the, network, physically, linked, individual, radio, stations, nearly, all, of, which, were, independently, owned, and, operated, in, a, vast, chain, nbc, s, audio, signal, thus, transmitted, from, station, to, station, to, listeners, across, the, united, states, other, companies, including, cbs, and, the, mutual, broadcasting, system, soon, followed, suit, each, network, signed, hundreds, of, individual, stations, on, as, affiliates, stations, which, agreed, to, broadcast, programs, from, one, of, the, networks, as, radio, prospered, throughout, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, experimental, television, stations, which, broadcast, both, an, audio, and, a, video, signal, began, sporadic, broadcasts, licenses, for, these, experimental, stations, were, often, granted, to, experienced, radio, broadcasters, and, thus, advances, in, television, technology, closely, followed, breakthroughs, in, radio, technology, as, interest, in, television, grew, and, as, early, television, stations, began, regular, broadcasts, the, idea, of, networking, television, signals, sending, one, station, s, video, and, audio, signal, to, outlying, stations, was, born, however, the, signal, from, an, electronic, television, system, containing, much, more, information, than, a, radio, signal, required, a, broadband, transmission, medium, transmission, by, a, nationwide, series, of, radio, relay, towers, would, be, possible, but, extremely, expensive, researchers, at, at, t, subsidiary, bell, telephone, laboratories, patented, coaxial, cable, in, 1929, primarily, as, a, telephone, improvement, device, its, high, capacity, transmitting, 240, telephone, calls, simultaneously, also, made, it, ideal, for, long, distance, television, transmission, where, it, could, handle, a, frequency, band, of, 1, mhz, german, television, first, demonstrated, such, an, application, in, 1936, by, relaying, televised, telephone, calls, from, berlin, to, leipzig, 180, km, 110, mi, away, by, cable, at, t, laid, the, first, l, carrier, coaxial, cable, between, new, york, city, and, philadelphia, with, automatic, signal, booster, stations, every, 10, miles, 16, km, and, in, 1937, it, experimented, with, transmitting, televised, motion, pictures, over, the, line, bell, labs, gave, demonstrations, of, the, new, york, philadelphia, television, link, in, 1940, and, 1941, at, t, used, the, coaxial, link, to, transmit, the, republican, national, convention, in, june, 1940, from, philadelphia, to, new, york, city, where, it, was, televised, to, a, few, hundred, receivers, over, the, nbc, station, w2xbs, which, evolved, into, wnbc, as, well, as, seen, in, schenectady, new, york, via, w2xb, which, evolved, into, wrgb, via, off, air, relay, from, the, new, york, station, nbc, had, earlier, demonstrated, an, inter, city, television, broadcast, on, 1, february, 1940, from, its, station, in, new, york, city, to, another, in, schenectady, new, york, by, general, electric, relay, antennas, and, began, transmitting, some, programs, on, an, irregular, basis, to, philadelphia, and, schenectady, in, 1941, wartime, priorities, suspended, the, manufacture, of, television, and, radio, equipment, for, civilian, use, from, 1, april, 1942, to, 1, october, 1945, temporarily, shutting, down, expansion, of, television, networking, however, in, 1944, a, short, film, patrolling, the, ether, was, broadcast, simultaneously, over, three, stations, as, an, experiment, at, t, made, its, first, postwar, addition, in, february, 1946, with, the, completion, of, a, 225, mile, 362, km, cable, between, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, although, a, blurry, demonstration, broadcast, showed, that, it, would, not, be, in, regular, use, for, several, months, the, dumont, television, network, which, had, begun, experimental, broadcasts, before, the, war, launched, what, newsweek, called, the, country, s, first, permanent, commercial, television, network, on, 15, august, 1946, connecting, new, york, city, with, washington, not, to, be, outdone, nbc, launched, what, it, called, the, world, s, first, regularly, operating, television, network, on, 27, june, 1947, serving, new, york, city, philadelphia, schenectady, and, washington, baltimore, and, boston, were, added, to, the, nbc, television, network, in, late, 1947, dumont, and, nbc, would, be, joined, by, cbs, and, abc, in, 1948, in, the, 1940s, the, term, chain, broadcasting, was, used, when, discussing, network, broadcasts, as, the, television, stations, were, linked, together, in, long, chains, along, the, east, coast, but, as, the, television, networks, expanded, westward, the, interconnected, television, stations, formed, major, networks, of, connected, affiliate, stations, in, january, 1949, with, the, sign, on, of, dumont, s, wdtv, in, pittsburgh, the, midwest, and, east, coast, networks, were, finally, connected, by, coaxial, cable, with, wdtv, airing, the, best, shows, from, all, four, networks, by, 1951, the, four, networks, stretched, from, coast, to, coast, carried, on, the, new, microwave, radio, relay, network, of, at, t, long, lines, only, a, few, local, television, stations, remained, independent, of, the, networks, each, of, the, four, major, television, networks, originally, only, broadcast, a, few, hours, of, programs, a, week, to, their, affiliate, stations, mostly, between, 8, 00, and, 11, 00, p, m, eastern, time, when, most, viewers, were, watching, television, most, of, the, programs, broadcast, by, the, television, stations, were, still, locally, produced, as, the, networks, increased, the, number, of, programs, that, they, aired, however, officials, at, the, federal, communications, commission, fcc, grew, concerned, that, local, television, might, disappear, altogether, eventually, the, federal, regulator, enacted, the, prime, time, access, rule, which, restricted, the, amount, of, time, that, the, networks, could, air, programs, officials, hoped, that, the, rules, would, foster, the, development, of, quality, local, programs, but, in, practice, most, local, stations, did, not, want, to, bear, the, burden, of, producing, many, of, their, own, programs, and, instead, chose, to, purchase, programs, from, independent, producers, sales, of, television, programs, to, individual, local, stations, are, done, through, a, method, called, broadcast, syndication, and, today, nearly, every, television, station, in, the, united, states, obtains, syndicated, programs, in, addition, to, network, produced, fare, late, in, the, 20th, century, cross, country, microwave, radio, relays, were, replaced, by, fixed, service, satellites, some, terrestrial, radio, relays, remained, in, service, for, regional, connections, after, the, failure, and, shutdown, of, dumont, in, 1956, several, attempts, at, new, networks, were, made, between, the, 1950s, and, the, 1970s, with, little, success, the, fox, broadcasting, company, founded, by, the, rupert, murdoch, owned, news, corporation, now, owned, by, fox, corporation, was, launched, on, 9, october, 1986, after, the, company, purchased, the, television, assets, of, metromedia, it, would, eventually, ascend, to, the, status, of, the, fourth, major, network, by, 1994, two, other, networks, launched, within, a, week, of, one, another, in, january, 1995, the, wb, television, network, a, joint, venture, between, time, warner, and, the, tribune, company, and, the, united, paramount, network, upn, formed, through, a, programming, alliance, between, chris, craft, industries, and, paramount, television, whose, parent, viacom, would, later, acquire, half, and, later, all, of, the, network, over, the, course, of, its, existence, in, september, 2006, the, cw, was, launched, as, a, merger, of, the, wb, and, upn, in, actuality, a, consolidation, of, each, respective, network, s, higher, rated, programs, onto, one, schedule, mynetworktv, a, network, formed, from, affiliates, of, upn, and, the, wb, that, did, not, affiliate, with, the, cw, launched, at, the, same, time, fcc, regulations, in, the, united, states, restricted, the, number, of, television, stations, that, could, be, owned, by, any, one, network, company, or, individual, this, led, to, a, system, where, most, local, television, stations, were, independently, owned, but, received, programming, from, the, network, through, a, franchising, contract, except, in, a, few, major, cities, that, had, owned, and, operated, stations, o, o, of, a, network, and, independent, stations, in, the, early, days, of, television, when, there, were, often, only, one, or, two, stations, broadcasting, in, a, given, market, the, stations, were, usually, affiliated, with, multiple, networks, and, were, able, to, choose, which, programs, would, air, eventually, as, more, stations, were, licensed, it, became, common, for, each, station, to, be, exclusively, affiliated, with, only, one, network, and, carry, all, of, the, prime, time, programs, that, the, network, offered, local, stations, occasionally, break, from, regularly, scheduled, network, programming, however, especially, when, a, breaking, news, or, severe, weather, situation, occurs, in, the, viewing, area, moreover, when, stations, return, to, network, programming, from, commercial, breaks, station, identifications, are, displayed, in, the, first, few, seconds, before, switching, to, the, network, s, logo, a, number, of, different, definitions, of, network, are, used, by, government, agencies, industry, and, the, general, public, under, the, broadcasting, act, a, network, is, defined, as, any, operation, where, control, over, all, or, any, part, of, the, programs, or, program, schedules, of, one, or, more, broadcasting, undertakings, is, delegated, to, another, undertaking, or, person, and, must, be, licensed, by, the, canadian, radio, television, and, telecommunications, commission, crtc, only, three, national, over, the, air, television, networks, are, currently, licensed, by, the, crtc, government, owned, cbc, television, english, and, ici, radio, canada, t, l, french, french, language, private, network, tva, and, aptn, a, network, focused, on, indigenous, peoples, in, canada, a, third, french, language, service, noovo, formerly, v, is, licensed, as, a, provincial, network, within, quebec, but, is, not, licensed, or, locally, distributed, outside, of, carriage, on, the, digital, tiers, of, pay, television, providers, on, a, national, basis, currently, licensed, national, or, provincial, networks, must, be, carried, by, all, cable, providers, in, the, country, or, province, respectively, with, a, service, area, above, a, certain, population, threshold, as, well, as, all, satellite, providers, however, they, are, no, longer, necessarily, expected, to, achieve, over, the, air, coverage, in, all, areas, aptn, for, example, only, has, terrestrial, coverage, in, parts, of, northern, canada, in, addition, to, these, licensed, networks, the, two, main, private, english, language, over, the, air, services, ctv, and, global, are, also, generally, considered, to, be, networks, by, virtue, of, their, national, coverage, although, they, are, not, officially, licensed, as, such, ctv, was, previously, a, licensed, network, but, relinquished, this, license, in, 2001, after, acquiring, most, of, its, affiliates, making, operating, a, network, license, essentially, redundant, per, the, above, definition, smaller, groups, of, stations, with, common, branding, are, often, categorized, by, industry, watchers, as, television, systems, although, the, public, and, the, broadcasters, themselves, will, often, refer, to, them, as, networks, regardless, some, of, these, systems, such, as, ctv, 2, and, the, now, defunct, e, essentially, operate, as, mini, networks, but, have, reduced, geographical, coverage, others, such, as, omni, television, or, the, crossroads, television, system, have, similar, branding, and, a, common, programming, focus, but, schedules, may, vary, significantly, from, one, station, to, the, next, citytv, originally, began, operating, as, a, television, system, in, 2002, when, ckvu, tv, in, vancouver, started, to, carry, programs, originating, from, city, tv, in, toronto, and, adopted, that, station, s, citytv, branding, but, gradually, became, a, network, by, virtue, of, national, coverage, through, expansions, into, other, markets, west, of, atlantic, canada, between, 2005, and, 2013, most, local, television, stations, in, canada, are, now, owned, and, operated, directly, by, their, network, with, only, a, small, number, of, stations, still, operating, as, affiliates, most, television, services, outside, north, america, are, national, networks, established, by, a, combination, of, publicly, funded, broadcasters, and, commercial, broadcasters, most, nations, established, television, networks, in, a, similar, way, the, first, television, service, in, each, country, was, operated, by, a, public, broadcaster, often, funded, by, a, television, licensing, fee, and, most, of, them, later, established, a, second, or, even, third, station, providing, a, greater, variety, of, content, commercial, television, services, also, became, available, when, private, companies, applied, for, television, broadcasting, licenses, often, each, new, network, would, be, identified, with, their, channel, number, so, that, individual, stations, would, often, be, numbered, one, two, three, and, so, forth, the, first, television, network, in, the, united, kingdom, was, operated, by, the, british, broadcasting, corporation, bbc, on, 2, november, 1936, the, bbc, opened, the, world, s, first, regular, high, definition, television, service, from, a, 405, lines, transmitter, at, alexandra, palace, the, bbc, remained, dominant, until, eventually, on, 22, september, 1955, commercial, broadcasting, was, established, to, create, a, second, television, network, rather, than, creating, a, single, network, with, local, channels, owned, and, operated, by, a, single, company, as, is, the, case, with, the, bbc, each, local, area, had, a, separate, television, channel, that, was, independently, owned, and, operated, although, most, of, these, channels, shared, a, number, of, programmes, particularly, during, peak, evening, viewing, hours, these, channels, formed, the, itv, network, when, the, advent, of, uhf, broadcasting, allowed, a, greater, number, of, television, channels, to, broadcast, the, bbc, launched, a, second, channel, bbc, 2, with, the, original, service, being, renamed, bbc, 1, a, second, national, commercial, network, was, launched, channel, 4, although, wales, instead, introduced, a, welsh, language, service, s4c, these, were, later, followed, by, the, launch, of, a, third, commercial, network, channel, 5, since, the, introduction, of, digital, television, the, bbc, itv, channel, 4, and, channel, 5, each, introduced, a, number, of, digital, only, channels, sky, operates, a, large, number, of, channels, as, does, uktv, sweden, had, only, one, television, network, from, 1956, until, the, early, 1990s, the, public, broadcaster, sveriges, television, svt, commercial, companies, such, as, modern, times, group, tv4, viasat, and, sbs, discovery, have, established, tv, networks, since, the, 1980s, although, they, initially, aired, exclusively, on, satellite, in, 1991, tv4, became, sweden, s, first, commercial, television, network, to, air, terrestrially, most, television, programming, in, sweden, is, centralised, except, for, local, news, updates, that, air, on, svt2, and, tv4, until, 1989, netherlands, public, broadcasting, was, the, only, television, network, in, the, netherlands, with, three, stations, nederland, 1,
