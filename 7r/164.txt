although, it, is, not, clear, whether, proto, indo, iranians, celebrated, a, feast, as, the, first, day, of, the, calendar, there, are, indications, that, iranians, may, have, observed, the, beginning, of, both, autumn, and, spring, respectively, related, to, the, harvest, and, the, sowing, of, seeds, for, the, celebration, of, the, new, year, mary, boyce, and, frantz, grenet, explain, the, traditions, for, seasonal, festivals, and, comment, it, is, possible, that, the, splendor, of, the, babylonian, festivities, at, this, season, led, the, iranians, to, develop, their, own, spring, festival, into, an, established, new, year, feast, with, the, name, navasarda, new, year, a, name, which, though, first, attested, through, middle, persian, derivatives, is, attributed, to, the, achaemenian, period, akitu, was, the, babylonian, festivity, held, during, the, spring, month, of, nisan, in, which, nowruz, falls, since, the, communal, observations, of, the, ancient, iranians, appear, in, general, to, have, been, seasonal, ones, and, related, to, agriculture, it, is, probable, that, they, traditionally, held, festivals, in, both, autumn, and, spring, to, mark, the, major, turning, points, of, the, natural, year, nowruz, is, partly, rooted, in, the, tradition, of, iranian, religions, such, as, mithraism, and, zoroastrianism, in, mithraism, festivals, had, a, deep, linkage, with, the, sun, s, light, the, iranian, festivals, such, as, mehregan, autumnal, equinox, tirgan, and, the, eve, of, chelle, ye, zemestan, winter, solstice, also, had, an, origin, in, the, sun, god, mithra, among, other, ideas, zoroastrianism, is, the, first, monotheistic, religion, that, emphasizes, broad, concepts, such, as, the, corresponding, work, of, good, and, evil, in, the, world, and, the, connection, of, humans, to, nature, zoroastrian, practices, were, dominant, for, much, of, the, history, of, ancient, iran, in, zoroastrianism, the, seven, most, important, zoroastrian, festivals, are, the, six, gahambar, festivals, and, nowruz, which, occurs, at, the, spring, equinox, according, to, mary, boyce, it, seems, a, reasonable, surmise, that, nowruz, the, holiest, of, them, all, with, deep, doctrinal, significance, was, founded, by, zoroaster, himself, although, there, is, no, clear, date, of, origin, between, sunset, on, the, day, of, the, sixth, gahambar, and, sunrise, of, nowruz, hamaspathmaedaya, later, known, in, its, extended, form, as, frawardinegan, and, today, is, known, as, farvardigan, was, celebrated, this, and, the, gahambars, are, the, only, festivals, named, in, the, surviving, text, of, the, avesta, the, 10th, century, scholar, biruni, in, his, work, kitab, al, tafhim, li, awa, il, sina, at, al, tanjim, provides, a, description, of, the, calendars, of, various, nations, besides, the, iranian, calendar, various, festivals, of, greeks, jews, arabs, sabians, and, other, nations, are, mentioned, in, the, book, in, the, section, on, the, iranian, calendar, he, mentions, nowruz, sadeh, tirgan, mehrgan, the, six, gahambars, farvardigan, bahmanja, esfand, armaz, and, several, other, festivals, according, to, him, it, is, the, belief, of, the, iranians, that, nowruz, marks, the, first, day, when, the, universe, started, its, motion, the, persian, historian, gardizi, in, his, work, titled, zayn, al, akhb, r, under, the, section, of, the, zoroastrians, festivals, mentions, nowruz, among, other, festivals, and, specifically, points, out, that, zoroaster, highly, emphasized, the, celebration, of, nowruz, and, mehrgan, although, the, word, nowruz, is, not, recorded, in, achaemenid, inscriptions, there, is, a, detailed, account, by, xenophon, of, a, nowruz, celebration, taking, place, in, persepolis, and, the, continuity, of, this, festival, in, the, achaemenid, tradition, nowruz, was, an, important, day, during, the, achaemenid, empire, c, 550, 330, bc, kings, of, the, different, achaemenid, nations, would, bring, gifts, to, the, king, of, kings, the, significance, of, the, ceremony, was, such, that, king, cambyses, ii, s, appointment, as, the, king, of, babylon, was, legitimized, only, after, his, participation, in, the, referred, annual, achaemenid, festival, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, famous, persepolis, complex, or, at, least, the, palace, of, apadana, and, the,

harem, queens, suggesting, that, purim, may, be, an, adoption, of, iranian, new, year, a, specific, novella, is, not, identified, and, encyclopedia, britannica, itself, notes, that, no, jewish, texts, of, this, genre, from, the, persian, period, are, extant, so, these, new, elements, can, be, recognized, only, inferentially, purim, is, celebrated, the, 14, of, adar, usually, within, a, month, before, nowruz, as, the, date, of, purim, is, set, according, to, the, jewish, calendar, which, is, lunisolar, while, nowruz, occurs, at, the, spring, equinox, it, is, possible, that, the, jews, and, iranians, of, the, time, may, have, shared, or, adopted, similar, customs, for, these, holidays, the, lunar, new, year, of, the, middle, east, occurs, on, 1, nisan, the, new, moon, of, the, first, month, of, spring, which, usually, falls, within, a, few, weeks, of, nowruz, in, his, shahnameh, the, tenth, century, poet, ferdowsi, narrates, a, fictional, account, of, darius, iii, s, death, where, an, injured, darius, with, his, head, cradled, on, alexander, the, great, s, thigh, asks, alexander, to, wed, roxana, so, their, children, might, uphold, nowruz, and, keep, the, flame, of, zoroaster, burning, her, mother, named, her, roxana, the, fair, the, world, found, joy, and, solace, in, her, care, from, her, perhaps, a, glorious, one, shall, rise, who, shall, renew, the, name, of, bold,
