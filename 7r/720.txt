itself, as, a, code, of, conduct, and, has, various, elements, such, as, valour, chivalry, honesty, and, compassion, it, is, an, abstract, concept, entailing, a, perceived, quality, of, worthiness, and, respectability, that, affects, both, the, social, standing, and, the, self, evaluation, of, an, individual, or, of, institutions, such, as, a, family, school, regiment, or, nation, accordingly, individuals, or, institutions, are, assigned, worth, and, stature, based, on, the, harmony, of, their, actions, with, a, specific, code, of, honour, and, with, the, moral, code, of, the, society, at, large, samuel, johnson, in, his, a, dictionary, of, the, english, language, 1755, defined, honour, as, having, several, senses, the, first, of, which, was, nobility, of, soul, magnanimity, and, a, scorn, of, meanness, this, sort, of, honour, derives, from, the, perceived, virtuous, conduct, and, personal, integrity, of, the, person, endowed, with, it, johnson, also, defined, honour, in, relationship, to, reputation, and, fame, to, privileges, of, rank, or, birth, and, as, respect, of, the, kind, which, places, an, individual, socially, and, determines, his, right, to, precedence, this, sort, of, honour, is, often, not, so, much, a, function, of, moral, or, ethical, excellence, as, it, is, a, consequence, of, power, finally, with, respect, to, sexuality, honour, has, traditionally, been, associated, with, or, identical, to, chastity, or, virginity, or, in, case, of, married, men, and, women, fidelity, some, have, argued, that, honour, should, be, seen, more, as, a, rhetoric, or, set, of, possible, actions, than, as, a, code, honour, as, a, code, of, behaviour, defines, the, duties, of, an, individual, within, a, social, group, margaret, visser, observes, that, in, an, honour, based, society, a, person, is, what, he, or, she, is, in, the, eyes, of, other, people, a, code, of, honour, differs, from, a, legal, code, also, socially, defined, and, concerned, with, justice, in, that, honour, remains, implicit, rather, than, explicit, and, objectified, one, can, distinguish, honour, from, dignity, which, wordsworth, assessed, as, measured, against, an, individual, s, conscience, rather, than, against, the, judgement, of, a, community, compare, also, the, sociological, concept, of, face, in, the, early, medieval, period, a, lord, s, or, lady, s, honour, was, the, group, of, manors, or, lands, he, or, she, held, the, word, was, first, used, indicating, an, estate, which, gave, its, holder, dignity, and, status, for, a, person, to, say, on, my, honour, was, not, just, an, affirmation, of, his, or, her, integrity, and, rank, but, the, veracity, behind, that, phrase, meant, he, or, she, was, willing, to, offer, up, estates, as, pledge, and, guarantee, the, concept, of, honour, appears, to, have, declined, in, importance, in, the, modern, west, conscience, has, replaced, it, in, the, individual, context, and, the, rule, of,

more, than, do, contemporary, industrial, societies, saint, anselm, of, canterbury, c, 1033, 1109, in, cur, deus, homo, extended, the, concept, of, honour, from, his, own, feudal, society, to, postulate, god, s, honour, an, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, honour, exists, in, such, traditional, institutions, as, the, military, serving, officers, may, conduct, a, court, of, honour, and, in, organisations, with, a, military, ethos, such, as, scouting, organisations, which, also, feature, courts, of, honour, honour, in, the, case, of, sexuality, frequently, relates, historically, to, fidelity, preservation, of, honour, equates, primarily, to, maintenance, of, the, virginity, of, singles, and, to, the, exclusive, monogamy, of, the, remainder, of, the, population, further, conceptions, of, this, type, of, honour, vary, widely, between, cultures, some, cultures, regard, honour, killings, of, mostly, female, members, of, one, s, own, family, as, justified, if, the, individuals, have, defiled, the, family, s, honour, by, marrying, against, the, family, s, wishes, usually, for, reasons, such, as, refusing, to, enter, an, arranged, marriage, having, sex, outside, marriage, dressing, in, ways, which, are, deemed, inappropriate, or, engaging, in, homosexual, relations, or, even, by, becoming, the, victims, of, rape, western, observers, generally, see, these,

anthropologists, have, contrasted, cultures, of, honour, with, cultures, of, law, a, culture, of, law, has, a, body, of, laws, which, all, members, of, society, must, obey, with, punishments, for, transgressors, this, requires, a, society, with, the, structures, required, to, enact, and, enforce, laws, a, culture, of, law, incorporates, a, social, contract, members, of, society, give, up, some, aspects, of, their, freedom, to, defend, themselves, and, to, retaliate, for, injuries, on, the, understanding, that, society, will, apprehend, and, punish, transgressors, an, alternative, to, government, enforcement, of, laws, is, community, or, individual, enforcement, of, social, norms, one, way, that, honour, functions, is, through, reputation, in, a, system, where, there, is, no,

shunned, by, the, community, as, a, way, to, punish, bad, behaviour, and, create, an, incentive, for, others, to, maintain, their, honour, if, one, s, honour, is, questioned, it, can, thus, be, important, to, disprove, any, false, accusations, or, slander, in, some, cultures, the, practice, of, dueling, arose, as, a, means, to, settle, such, disputes, firmly, though, by, physical, dominance, in, force, or, skill, rather, than, by, objective, consideration, of, evidence, and, facts, honour, can, also, imply, duty, to, perform, certain, actions, such, as, providing, for, and, disciplining,

of, honour, are, often, conservative, encoding, pre, modern, traditional, family, values, and, duties, in, some, cases, these, values, clash, with, those, of, post, sexual, revolution, and, egalitarian, societies, cultures, of, law, sometimes, consider, practices, in, honour, cultures, to, be, unethical, or, a, violation, of, the, legal, concept, of, human, rights, for, example, they,

examined, the, culture, of, honour, in, the, american, south, social, scientists, have, looked, at, specialised, subcultures, such, as, south, asian, muslims, in, britain, others, have, compared, multiple, modern, nations, from, the, viewpoint, of, anthropologists, cultures, of, honour, typically, appear, among, nomadic, peoples, and, among, herdsmen, who, carry, their, most, valuable, property, with, them, and, risk, having, it, stolen, without, having, recourse, to, law, enforcement, or, to, government, due, to, the, lack, of, strong, institutions, cultivating, a, reputation, for, swift, and, disproportionate, revenge, increases, the, safety, of, one, s, person, and, property, against, aggressive, actors, according, to, richard, nisbett, cultures, of, honour, will, often, arise, when, three, conditions, exist, historically, cultures, of, honour, exist, where, the, herding, of, animals, dominates, an, economy, in, this, situation, the, geography, is, usually, extensive, since, the, soil, cannot, support, intensive, sustained, farming, and, thus, large, populations, the, benefit, of, stealing, animals, from, other, herds, is, high, since, animals, are, the, main, form, of, wealth, and, there, is, no, central, law, enforcement, or, rule, of, law, however, cultures, of, honour, can, also, appear, in, places, like, modern, inner, city, slums, the, three, conditions, exist, here, as, well, lack, of, resources, poverty, crime, and, theft, have, high, rewards, compared, to, the, very, limited, alternatives, and, law, enforcement, is, generally, lax, or, corrupt, once, a, culture, of, honour, exists, in, a, society, its, members, find, it, difficult, to, make, the, transition, to, a, culture, of, law, which, requires, that, people, become, willing, to, back, down, and, refuse, to, immediately, retaliate, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, culture, of, honour, the, perceived, humiliation, of, such, an, action, makes, personal, restraint, extremely,

of, the, war, of, 1812, which, the, united, states, launched, against, britain, despite, britain, s, much, more, powerful, naval, and, military, strength, americans, of, every, political, stripe, saw,

force, in, response, this, quest, for, honour, was, a, major, cause, of, the, war, in, the, sense, that, most, americans, who, were, not, involved, in, mercantile, interests, or, threatened, by, indian, attack, strongly, endorsed, the, preservation, of, national, honour, the, humiliating, attack, by, hms, leopard, against, uss, chesapeake, in, june, 1807, was, a, decisive, event, historians,

more, likely, to, end, in, victory, for, the, united, states, than, disputes, under, non, southern, presidents, other, characteristics, of, southern, presidencies, do, not, seem, able, to, account,
