a, community, is, a, social, unit, a, group, of, living, things, with, a, shared, socially, significant, characteristic, such, as, place, set, of, norms, culture, religion, values, customs, or, identity, communities, may, share, a, sense, of, place, situated, in, a, given, geographical, area, e, g, a, country, village, town, or, neighborhood, or, in, virtual, space, through, communication, platforms, durable, good, relations, that, extend, beyond, immediate, genealogical, ties, also, define, a, sense, of, community, important, to, people, s, identity, practice, and, roles, in, social, institutions, such, as, family, home, work, government, tv, network, society, or, humanity, at, large, although, communities, are, usually, small, relative, to, personal, social, ties, community, may, also, refer, to, large, group, affiliations, such, as, national, communities, international, communities, and, virtual, communities, in, terms, of, sociological, categories, a, community, can, seem, like, a, sub, set, of, a, social, collectivity, in, developmental, views, a, community, can, emerge, out, of, a, collectivity, the, english, language, word, community, derives, from, the, old, french, comunet, modern, french, communaut, which, comes, from, the, latin, communitas, community, public, spirit, from, latin, communis, common, human, communities, may, have, intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and, risks, in, common, affecting, the, identity, of, the, participants, and, their, degree, of, cohesiveness, archaeological, studies, of, social, communities, use, the, term, community, in, two, ways, mirroring, usage, in, other, areas, the, first, meaning, is, an, informal, definition, of, community, as, a, place, where, people, used, to, live, in, this, literal, sense, it, is, synonymous, with, the, concept, of, an, ancient, settlement, whether, a, hamlet, village, town, or, city, the, second, meaning, resembles, the, usage, of, the, term, in, other, social, sciences, a, community, is, a, group, of, people, living, near, one, another, who, interact, socially, social, interaction, on, a, small, scale, can, be, difficult, to, identify, with, archaeological, data, most, reconstructions, of, social, communities, by, archaeologists, rely, on, the, principle, that, social, interaction, in, the, past, was, conditioned, by, physical, distance, therefore, a, small, village, settlement, likely, constituted, a, social, community, and, spatial, subdivisions, of, cities, and, other, large, settlements, may, have, formed, communities, archaeologists, typically, use, similarities, in, material, culture, from, house, types, to, styles, of, pottery, to, reconstruct, communities, in, the, past, this, classification, method, relies, on, the, assumption, that, people, or, households, will, share, more, similarities, in, the, types, and, styles, of, their, material, goods, with, other, members, of, a, social, community, than, they, will, with, outsiders, early, sociological, studies, identified, communities, as, fringe, groups, at, the, behest, of, local, power, elites, such, early, academic, studies, include, who, governs, by, robert, dahl, as, well, as, the, papers, by, floyd, hunter, on, atlanta, at, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, the, concept, of, community, was, rediscovered, by, academics, politicians, and, activists, politicians, hoping, for, a, democratic, election, started, to, realign, with, community, interests, in, ecology, a, community, is, an, assemblage, of, populations, potentially, of, different, species, interacting, with, one, another, community, ecology, is, the, branch, of, ecology, that, studies, interactions, between, and, among, species, it, considers, how, such, interactions, along, with, interactions, between, species, and, the, abiotic, environment, affect, social, structure, and, species, richness, diversity, and, patterns, of, abundance, species, interact, in, three, ways, competition, predation, and, mutualism, the, two, main, types, of, ecological, communities, are, major, communities, which, are, self, sustaining, and, self, regulating, such, as, a, forest, or, a, lake, and, minor, communities, which, rely, on, other, communities, like, fungi, decomposing, a, log, and, are, the, building, blocks, of, major, communities, moreover, we, can, establish, other, non, taxonomic, subdivisions, of, biocenosis, such, as, guilds, the, concept, of, community, often, has, a, positive, semantic, connotation, exploited, rhetorically, by, populist, politicians, and, by, advertisers, to, promote, feelings, and, associations, of, mutual, well, being, happiness, and, togetherness, veering, towards, an, almost, achievable, utopian, community, in, contrast, the, epidemiological, term, community, transmission, can, have, negative, implications, and, instead, of, a, criminal, community, one, often, speaks, of, a, criminal, underworld, or, of, the, criminal, fraternity, in, gemeinschaft, und, gesellschaft, 1887, german, sociologist, ferdinand, t, nnies, described, two, types, of, human, association, gemeinschaft, usually, translated, as, community, and, gesellschaft, society, or, association, t, nnies, proposed, the, gemeinschaft, gesellschaft, dichotomy, as, a, way, to, think, about, social, ties, no, group, is, exclusively, one, or, the, other, gemeinschaft, stress, personal, social, interactions, and, the, roles, values, and, beliefs, based, on, such, interactions, gesellschaft, stress, indirect, interactions, impersonal, roles, formal, values, and, beliefs, based, on, such, interactions, in, a, seminal, 1986, study, mcmillan, and, chavis, identify, four, elements, of, sense, of, community, a, sense, of, community, index, sci, was, developed, by, chavis, and, colleagues, and, revised, and, adapted, by, others, although, originally, designed, to, assess, sense, of, community, in, neighborhoods, the, index, has, been, adapted, for, use, in, schools, the, workplace, and, a, variety, of, types, of, communities, studies, conducted, by, the, appa, indicate, that, young, adults, who, feel, a, sense, of, belonging, in, a, community, particularly, small, communities, develop, fewer, psychiatric, and, depressive, disorders, than, those, who, do, not, have, the, feeling, of, love, and, belonging, the, process, of, learning, to, adopt, the, behavior, patterns, of, the, community, is, called, socialization, the, most, fertile, time, of, socialization, is, usually, the, early, stages, of, life, during, which, individuals, develop, the, skills, and, knowledge, and, learn, the, roles, necessary, to, function, within, their, culture, and, social, environment, for, some, psychologists, especially, those, in, the, psychodynamic, tradition, the, most, important, period, of, socialization, is, between, the, ages, of, one, and, ten, but, socialization, also, includes, adults, moving, into, a, significantly, different, environment, where, they, must, learn, a, new, set, of, behaviors, socialization, is, influenced, primarily, by, the, family, through, which, children, first, learn, community, norms, other, important, influences, include, schools, peer, groups, people, mass, media, the, workplace, and, government, the, degree, to, which, the, norms, of, a, particular, society, or, community, are, adopted, determines, one, s, willingness, to, engage, with, others, the, norms, of, tolerance, reciprocity, and, trust, are, important, habits, of, the, heart, as, de, tocqueville, put, it, in, an, individual, s, involvement, in, community, community, development, is, often, linked, with, community, work, or, community, planning, and, may, involve, stakeholders, foundations, governments, or, contracted, entities, including, non, government, organisations, ngos, universities, or, government, agencies, to, progress, the, social, well, being, of, local, regional, and, sometimes, national, communities, more, grassroots, efforts, called, community, building, or, community, organizing, seek, to, empower, individuals, and, groups, of, people, by, providing, them, with, the, skills, they, need, to, effect, change, in, their, own, communities, these, skills, often, assist, in, building, political, power, through, the, formation, of, large, social, groups, working, for, a, common, agenda, community, development, practitioners, must, understand, both, how, to, work, with, individuals, and, how, to, affect, communities, positions, within, the, context, of, larger, social, institutions, public, administrators, in, contrast, need, to, understand, community, development, in, the, context, of, rural, and, urban, development, housing, and, economic, development, and, community, organizational, and, business, development, formal, accredited, programs, conducted, by, universities, as, part, of, degree, granting, institutions, are, often, used, to, build, a, knowledge, base, to, drive, curricula, in, public, administration, sociology, and, community, studies, the, general, social, survey, from, the, national, opinion, research, center, at, the, university, of, chicago, and, the, saguaro, seminar, at, the, harvard, kennedy, school, are, examples, of, national, community, development, in, the, united, states, the, maxwell, school, of, citizenship, and, public, affairs, at, syracuse, university, in, new, york, state, offers, core, courses, in, community, and, economic, development, and, in, areas, ranging, from, non, profit, development, to, us, budgeting, federal, to, local, community, funds, in, the, united, kingdom, the, university, of, oxford, has, led, in, providing, extensive, research, in, the, field, through, its, community, development, journal, used, worldwide, by, sociologists, and, community, development, practitioners, at, the, intersection, between, community, development, and, community, building, are, a, number, of, programs, and, organizations, with, community, development, tools, one, example, of, this, is, the, program, of, the, asset, based, community, development, institute, of, northwestern, university, the, institute, makes, available, downloadable, tools, to, assess, community, assets, and, make, connections, between, non, profit, groups, and, other, organizations, that, can, help, in, community, building, the, institute, focuses, on, helping, communities, develop, by, mobilizing, neighborhood, assets, building, from, the, inside, out, rather, than, the, outside, in, in, the, disability, field, community, building, was, prevalent, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, with, roots, in, john, mcknight, s, approaches, in, the, different, drum, community, making, and, peace, 1987, scott, peck, argues, that, the, almost, accidental, sense, of, community, that, exists, at, times, of, crisis, can, be, consciously, built, peck, believes, that, conscious, community, building, is, a, process, of, deliberate, design, based, on, the, knowledge, and, application, of, certain, rules, he, states, that, this, process, goes, through, four, stages, in, 1991, peck, remarked, that, building, a, sense, of, community, is, easy, but, maintaining, this, sense, of, community, is, difficult, in, the, modern, world, an, interview, with, m, scott, peck, by, alan, atkisson, in, context, 29, p, 26, the, three, basic, types, of, community, organizing, are, grassroots, organizing, coalition, building, and, institution, based, community, organizing, also, called, broad, based, community, organizing, an, example, of, which, is, faith, based, community, organizing, or, congregation, based, community, organizing, community, building, can, use, a, wide, variety, of, practices, ranging, from, simple, events, e, g, potlucks, small, book, clubs, to, larger, scale, efforts, e, g, mass, festivals, construction, projects, that, involve, local, participants, rather, than, outside, contractors, community, building, that, is, geared, toward, citizen, action, is, usually, termed, community, organizing, in, these, cases, organized, community, groups, seek, accountability, from, elected, officials, and, increased, direct, representation, within, decision, making, bodies, where, good, faith, negotiations, fail, these, constituency, led, organizations, seek, to, pressure, the, decision, makers, through, a, variety, of, means, including, picketing, boycotting, sit, ins, petitioning, and, electoral, politics, community, organizing, can, focus, on, more, than, just, resolving, specific, issues, organizing, often, means, building, a, widely, accessible, power, structure, often, with, the, end, goal, of, distributing, power, equally, throughout, the, community, community, organizers, generally, seek, to, build, groups, that, are, open, and, democratic, in, governance, such, groups, facilitate, and, encourage, consensus, decision, making, with, a, focus, on, the, general, health, of, the, community, rather, than, a, specific, interest, group, if, communities, are, developed, based, on, something, they, share, in, common, whether, location, or, values, then, one, challenge, for, developing, communities, is, how, to, incorporate, individuality, and, differences, rebekah, nathan, suggests, in, her, book, my, freshman, year, we, are, drawn, to, developing, communities, totally, based, on, sameness, despite, stated, commitments, to, diversity, such, as, those, found, on, university, websites, a, number, of, ways, to, categorize, types, of, community, have, been, proposed, one, such, breakdown, is, as, follows, the, usual, categorizations, of, community, relations, have, a, number, of, problems, 1, they, tend, to, give, the, impression, that, a, particular, community, can, be, defined, as, just, this, kind, or, another, 2, they, tend, to, conflate, modern, and, customary, community, relations, 3, they, tend, to, take, sociological, categories, such, as, ethnicity, or, race, as, given, forgetting, that, different, ethnically, defined, persons, live, in, different, kinds, of, communities, grounded, interest, based, diasporic, etc, in, response, to, these, problems, paul, james, and, his, colleagues, have, developed, a, taxonomy, that, maps, community, relations, and, recognizes, that, actual, communities, can, be, characterized, by, different, kinds, of, relations, at, the, same, time, in, these, terms, communities, can, be, nested, and, or, intersecting, one, community, can, contain, another, for, example, a, location, based, community, may, contain, a, number, of, ethnic, communities, both, lists, above, can, be, used, in, a, cross, cutting, matrix, in, relation, to, each, other, in, general, virtual, communities, value, knowledge, and, information, as, currency, or, social, resource, what, differentiates, virtual, communities, from, their, physical, counterparts, is, the, extent, and, impact, of, weak, ties, which, are, the, relationships, acquaintances, or, strangers, form, to, acquire, information, through, online, networks, relationships, among, members, in, a, virtual, community, tend, to, focus, on, information, exchange, about, specific, topics, a, survey, conducted, by, pew, internet, and, the, american, life, project, in, 2001, found, those, involved, in, entertainment, professional, and, sports, virtual, groups, focused, their, activities, on, obtaining, information, an, epidemic, of, bullying, and, harassment, has, arisen, from, the, exchange, of, information, between, strangers, especially, among, teenagers, in, virtual, communities, despite, attempts, to, implement, anti, bullying, policies, sheri, bauman, professor, of, counselling, at, the, university, of, arizona, claims, the, most, effective, strategies, to, prevent, bullying, may, cost, companies, revenue, virtual, internet, mediated, communities, can, interact, with, offline, real, life, activity, potentially, forming, strong, and, tight, knit, groups, such, as, qanon
