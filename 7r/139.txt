oral, tradition, or, oral, lore, is, a, form, of, human, communication, in, which, knowledge, art, ideas, and, culture, are, received, preserved, and, transmitted, orally, from, one, generation, to, another, the, transmission, is, through, speech, or, song, and, may, include, folktales, ballads, chants, prose, or, poetry, the, information, is, mentally, recorded, by, oral, repositories, sometimes, termed, walking, libraries, who, are, usually, also, performers, oral, tradition, is, a, medium, of, communication, for, a, society, to, transmit, oral, history, oral, literature, oral, law, and, other, knowledge, across, generations, without, a, writing, system, or, in, parallel, to, a, writing, system, religions, such, as, buddhism, hinduism, catholicism, and, jainism, have, used, oral, tradition, in, parallel, to, writing, to, transmit, their, canonical, scriptures, rituals, hymns, and, mythologies, sub, saharan, african, societies, have, broadly, been, labelled, as, oral, civilisations, contrasted, with, literate, civilisations, due, to, their, reverence, for, the, spoken, over, the, written, word, oral, tradition, is, memories, knowledge, and, expression, held, in, common, by, a, group, over, many, generations, it, is, the, long, preservation, of, immediate, or, contemporaneous, testimony, it, may, be, defined, as, the, recall, and, transmission, of, specific, preserved, textual, and, cultural, knowledge, through, vocal, utterance, as, an, academic, discipline, oral, tradition, refers, both, to, objects, and, methods, of, study, it, is, distinct, from, oral, history, which, is, the, recording, of, personal, testimony, of, those, who, experienced, historical, eras, or, events, oral, tradition, is, also, distinct, from, the, study, of, orality, defined, as, thought, and, its, verbal, expression, in, societies, where, the, technologies, of, literacy, writing, and, print, are, unfamiliar, folklore, is, one, albeit, not, the, only, type, of, oral, tradition, this, means, of, communication, has, been, the, most, widespread, application, of, human, communication, for, centuries, according, to, john, foley, oral, tradition, has, been, an, ancient, human, tradition, found, in, all, corners, of, the, world, modern, archaeology, has, been, unveiling, evidence, of, the, human, efforts, to, preserve, and, transmit, arts, and, knowledge, that, depended, completely, or, partially, on, an, oral, tradition, across, various, cultures, the, judeo, christian, bible, reveals, its, oral, traditional, roots, medieval, european, manuscripts, are, penned, by, performing, scribes, geometric, vases, from, archaic, greece, mirror, homer, s, oral, style, indeed, if, these, final, decades, of, the, millennium, have, taught, us, anything, it, must, be, that, oral, tradition, never, was, the, other, we, accused, it, of, being, it, never, was, the, primitive, preliminary, technology, of, communication, we, thought, it, to, be, rather, if, the, whole, truth, is, told, oral, tradition, stands, out, as, the, single, most, dominant, communicative, technology, of, our, species, as, both, a, historical, fact, and, in, many, areas, still, a, contemporary, reality, before, the, introduction, of, text, oral, tradition, remained, the, only, means, of, communication, in, order, to, establish, societies, as, well, as, its, institutions, despite, widespread, comprehension, of, literacy, in, the, recent, century, oral, tradition, remains, the, dominant, communicative, means, within, the, world, all, indigenous, african, societies, use, oral, tradition, to, learn, their, origin, and, history, civic, and, religious, duties, crafts, and, skills, as, well, as, traditional, myths, and, legends, it, is, also, a, key, socio, cultural, component, in, the, practice, of, their, traditional, spiritualities, as, well, as, mainstream, abrahamic, religions, the, prioritisation, of, the, spoken, word, is, evidenced, by, african, societies, having, chosen, to, record, history, orally, whilst, some, had, developed, or, had, access, to, a, writing, script, jan, vansina, differentiates, between, oral, and, literate, civilisations, stating, the, attitude, of, members, of, an, oral, society, toward, speech, is, similar, to, the, reverence, members, of, a, literate, society, attach, to, the, written, word, if, it, is, hallowed, by, authority, or, antiquity, the, word, will, be, treasured, for, centuries, in, europe, all, data, felt, to, be, important, were, written, down, with, the, most, important, texts, prioritised, such, as, bible, and, only, trivia, such, as, song, legend, anecdote, and, proverbs, remained, unrecorded, in, africa, all, the, principal, political, legal, social, and, religious, texts, were, transmitted, orally, when, the, bamums, in, cameroon, invented, a, script, the, first, to, be, written, down, was, the, royal, chronicle, and, the, code, of, customary, law, most, african, courts, had, archivists, who, learnt, by, heart, the, royal, genealogy, and, history, of, the, state, and, served, as, its, unwritten, constitution, the, performance, of, a, tradition, is, accentuated, and, rendered, alive, by, various, gesture, social, conventions, and, the, unique, occasion, in, which, it, is, performed, furthermore, the, climate, in, which, traditions, are, told, influences, its, content, in, burundi, traditions, were, short, because, most, of, them, were, told, at, informal, gatherings, and, everyone, had, to, have, his, say, during, the, evening, in, neighbouring, rwanda, many, narratives, were, spun, out, because, a, one, man, professional, had, to, entertain, his, patron, for, a, whole, evening, with, every, production, checked, by, fellow, specialists, and, errors, punishable, frequently, glosses, or, commentaries, were, presented, parallel, to, the, narrative, sometimes, answering, questions, from, the, audience, to, ensure, understanding, although, often, someone, would, learn, a, tradition, without, asking, their, master, questions, and, not, really, understand, the, meaning, of, its, content, leading, them, to, speculate, in, the, commentary, oral, traditions, only, exist, when, they, are, told, except, for, in, people, s, minds, and, so, the, frequency, of, telling, a, tradition, aids, its, preservation, these, african, ethnic, groups, also, utilize, oral, tradition, to, develop, and, train, the, human, intellect, and, the, memory, to, retain, information, and, sharpen, imagination, perhaps, the, most, famous, repository, of, oral, tradition, is, the, west, african, griot, named, differently, in, different, languages, the, griot, is, a, hereditary, position, and, exists, in, dyula, soninke, fula, hausa, songhai, wolof, serer, and, mossi, societies, among, many, others, although, more, famously, in, mandinka, society, they, constitute, a, caste, and, perform, a, range, of, roles, including, as, a, historian, or, library, musician, poet, mediator, of, family, and, tribal, disputes, spokesperson, and, served, in, the, king, s, court, not, dissimilar, from, the, european, bard, they, keep, records, of, all, births, death, and, marriages, through, the, generations, of, the, village, or, family, when, sundiata, keita, founded, the, mali, empire, he, was, offered, balla, fass, k, as, his, griot, to, advise, him, during, his, reign, giving, rise, to, the, kouyate, line, of, griots, griots, often, accompany, their, telling, of, oral, tradition, with, a, musical, instrument, as, the, epic, of, sundiata, is, accompanied, by, the, balafon, or, as, the, kora, accompanies, other, traditions, in, modern, times, some, griots, and, descendants, of, griots, have, dropped, their, historian, role, and, focus, on, music, with, many, finding, success, however, many, still, maintain, their, traditional, roles, albanian, traditions, have, been, handed, down, orally, across, generations, they, have, been, preserved, through, traditional, memory, systems, that, have, survived, intact, into, modern, times, in, albania, a, phenomenon, that, is, explained, by, the, lack, of, state, formation, among, albanians, and, their, ancestors, the, illyrians, being, able, to, preserve, their, tribally, organized, society, this, distinguished, them, from, civilizations, such, as, ancient, egypt, minoans, and, mycenaeans, who, underwent, state, formation, and, disrupted, their, traditional, memory, practices, albanian, epic, poetry, has, been, analysed, by, homeric, scholars, to, acquire, a, better, understanding, of, homeric, epics, the, long, oral, tradition, that, has, sustained, albanian, epic, poetry, reinforces, the, idea, that, pre, homeric, epic, poetry, was, oral, the, theory, of, oral, formulaic, composition, was, developed, also, through, the, scholarly, study, of, albanian, epic, verse, the, albanian, traditional, singing, of, epic, verse, from, memory, is, one, of, the, last, survivors, of, its, kind, in, modern, europe, and, the, last, survivor, of, the, balkan, traditions, all, ancient, greek, literature, states, steve, reece, was, to, some, degree, oral, in, nature, and, the, earliest, literature, was, completely, so, homer, s, epic, poetry, states, michael, gagarin, was, largely, composed, performed, and, transmitted, orally, as, folklores, and, legends, were, performed, in, front, of, distant, audiences, the, singers, would, substitute, the, names, in, the, stories, with, local, characters, or, rulers, to, give, the, stories, a, local, flavor, and, thus, connect, with, the, audience, but, making, the, historicity, embedded, in, the, oral, tradition, unreliable, the, lack, of, surviving, texts, about, the, greek, and, roman, religious, traditions, have, led, scholars, to, presume, that, these, were, ritualistic, and, transmitted, as, oral, traditions, but, some, scholars, disagree, that, the, complex, rituals, in, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, civilizations, were, an, exclusive, product, of, an, oral, tradition, an, irish, seancha, plural, seanchaithe, meaning, bearer, of, old, lore, was, a, traditional, irish, language, storyteller, the, scottish, gaelic, equivalent, being, the, seanchaidh, anglicised, as, shanachie, the, job, of, a, seancha, was, to, serve, the, head, of, a, lineage, by, passing, information, orally, from, one, generation, to, the, next, about, irish, folklore, and, history, particularly, in, medieval, times, in, asia, the, transmission, of, folklore, mythologies, as, well, as, scriptures, in, ancient, india, in, different, indian, religions, was, by, oral, tradition, preserved, with, precision, with, the, help, of, elaborate, mnemonic, techniques, according, to, goody, the, vedic, texts, likely, involved, both, a, written, and, oral, tradition, calling, it, a, parallel, products, of, a, literate, society, mostly, recently, research, shows, that, oral, performance, of, written, texts, could, be, a, philosophical, activity, in, early, china, it, is, a, common, knowledge, in, india, that, the, primary, hindu, books, called, vedas, are, great, example, of, oral, tradition, pundits, who, memorized, three, vedas, were, called, trivedis, pundits, who, memorized, four, vedas, were, called, chaturvedis, by, transferring, knowledge, from, generation, to, generation, hindus, protected, their, ancient, mantras, in, vedas, which, are, basically, prose, the, early, buddhist, texts, are, also, generally, believed, to, be, of, oral, tradition, with, the, first, by, comparing, inconsistencies, in, the, transmitted, versions, of, literature, from, various, oral, societies, such, as, the, greek, serbia, and, other, cultures, then, noting, that, the, vedic, literature, is, too, consistent, and, vast, to, have, been, composed, and, transmitted, orally, across, generations, without, being, written, down, in, the, middle, east, arabic, oral, tradition, has, significantly, influenced, literary, and, cultural, practices, arabic, oral, tradition, encompassed, various, forms, of, expression, including, metrical, poetry, unrhymed, prose, rhymed, prose, saj, and, prosimetrum, a, combination, of, prose, and, poetry, often, employed, in, historical, narratives, poetry, held, a, position, of, particular, importance, as, it, was, believed, to, be, a, more, reliable, medium, for, information, transmission, than, prose, this, belief, stemmed, from, observations, that, highly, structured, language, with, its, rhythmic, and, phonetic, patterns, tended, to, undergo, fewer, alterations, during, oral, transmission, each, genre, of, rhymed, poetry, served, distinct, social, and, cultural, functions, these, range, from, spontaneous, compositions, at, celebrations, to, carefully, crafted, historical, accounts, political, commentaries, and, entertainment, pieces, among, these, the, folk, epics, known, as, siyar, singular, s, ra, were, considered, the, most, intricate, these, prosimetric, narratives, combining, prose, and, verse, emerged, in, the, early, middle, ages, while, many, such, epics, circulated, historically, only, one, has, survived, as, a, sung, oral, poetic, tradition, s, rat, ban, hil, l, this, epic, recounts, the, westward, migration, and, conquests, of, the, banu, hilal, bedouin, tribe, from, the, 10th, to, 12th, centuries, culminating, in, their, rule, over, parts, of, north, africa, before, their, eventual, defeat, the, historical, roots, of, s, rat, ban, hil, l, are, evident, in, the, present, day, distribution, of, groups, claiming, descent, from, the, tribe, across, north, africa, and, parts, of, the, middle, east, the, epic, s, development, into, a, cohesive, narrative, was, first, documented, by, the, historian, ibn, khald, n, in, the, 14th, century, in, his, writings, ibn, khald, n, describes, collecting, stories, and, poems, from, nomadic, arabs, using, these, oral, sources, to, discuss, the, merits, of, colloquial, versus, classical, poetry, and, the, value, of, oral, histories, in, written, historical, works, the, torah, and, other, ancient, jewish, literature, the, judeo, christian, bible, and, texts, of, early, centuries, of, christianity, are, rooted, in, an, oral, tradition, and, the, term, people, of, the, book, is, a, medieval, construct, this, is, evidenced, for, example, by, the, multiple, scriptural, statements, by, paul, admitting, previously, remembered, tradition, which, he, received, orally, australian, aboriginal, culture, has, thrived, on, oral, traditions, and, oral, histories, passed, down, through, thousands, of, years, in, a, study, published, in, february, 2020, new, evidence, showed, that, both, budj, bim, and, tower, hill, volcanoes, erupted, between, 34, 000, and, 40, 000, years, ago, significantly, this, is, a, minimum, age, constraint, for, human, presence, in, victoria, and, also, could, be, interpreted, as, evidence, for, the, oral, histories, of, the, gunditjmara, people, an, aboriginal, australian, people, of, south, western, victoria, which, tell, of, volcanic, eruptions, being, some, of, the, oldest, oral, traditions, in, existence, a, basalt, stone, axe, found, underneath, volcanic, ash, in, 1947, had, already, proven, that, humans, inhabited, the, region, before, the, eruption, of, tower, hill, native, american, society, was, always, reliant, upon, oral, tradition, if, not, storytelling, in, order, to, convey, knowledge, morals, and, traditions, amongst, others, a, trait, western, settlers, deemed, as, representing, an, inferior, race, without, neither, culture, nor, history, often, cited, as, a, reason, behind, indoctrination, writing, systems, are, not, known, to, exist, among, native, north, americans, before, contact, with, europeans, except, among, some, mesoamerican, cultures, and, possibly, the, south, american, quipu, and, north, american, wampum, although, those, two, are, debatable, oral, storytelling, traditions, flourished, in, a, context, without, the, use, of, writing, to, record, and, preserve, history, scientific, knowledge, and, social, practices, while, some, stories, were, told, for, amusement, and, leisure, most, functioned, as, practical, lessons, from, tribal, experience, applied, to, immediate, moral, social, psychological, and, environmental, issues, stories, fuse, fictional, supernatural, or, otherwise, exaggerated, characters, and, circumstances, with, real, emotions, and, morals, as, a, means, of, teaching, plots, often, reflect, real, life, situations, and, may, be, aimed, at, particular, people, known, by, the, story, s, audience, in, this, way, social, pressure, could, be, exerted, without, directly, causing, embarrassment, or, social, exclusion, for, example, rather, than, yelling, inuit, parents, might, deter, their, children, from, wandering, too, close, to, the, water, s, edge, by, telling, a, story, about, a, sea, monster, with, a, pouch, for, children, within, its, reach, one, single, story, could, provide, dozens, of, lessons, stories, were, also, used, as, a, means, to, assess, whether, traditional, cultural, ideas, and, practices, are, effective, in, tackling, contemporary, circumstances, or, if, they, should, be, revised, native, american, storytelling, is, a, collaborative, experience, between, storyteller, and, listeners, native, american, tribes, generally, have, not, had, professional, tribal, storytellers, marked, by, social, status, stories, could, and, can, be, told, by, anyone, with, each, storyteller, using, their, own, vocal, inflections, word, choice, content, or, form, storytellers, not, only, draw, upon, their, own, memories, but, also, upon, a, collective, or, tribal, memory, extending, beyond, personal, experience, but, nevertheless, representing, a, shared, reality, native, languages, have, in, some, cases, up, to, twenty, words, to, describe, physical, features, like, rain, or, snow, and, can, describe, the, spectra, of, human, emotion, in, very, precise, ways, allowing, storytellers, to, offer, their, own, personalized, take, on, a, story, based, on, their, own, lived, experiences, fluidity, in, story, deliverance, allowed, stories, to, be, applied, to, different, social, circumstances, according, to, the, storyteller, s, objective, at, the, time, one, s, rendition, of, a, story, was, often, considered, a, response, to, another, s, rendition, with, plot, alterations, suggesting, alternative, ways, of, applying, traditional, ideas, to, present, conditions, listeners, might, have, heard, the, story, told, many, times, or, even, may, have, told, the, same, story, themselves, this, does, not, take, away, from, a, story, s, meaning, as, curiosity, about, what, happens, next, was, less, of, a, priority, than, hearing, fresh, perspectives, on, well, known, themes, and, plots, elder, storytellers, generally, were, not, concerned, with, discrepancies, between, their, version, of, historical, events, and, neighboring, tribes, version, of, similar, events, such, as, in, origin, stories, tribal, stories, are, considered, valid, within, the, tribe, s, own, frame, of, reference, and, tribal, experience, the, 19th, century, oglala, lakota, tribal, member, four, guns, was, known, for, his, justification, of, the, oral, tradition, and, criticism, of, the, written, word, stories, are, used, to, preserve, and, transmit, both, tribal, history, and, environmental, history, which, are, often, closely, linked, native, oral, traditions, in, the, pacific, northwest, for, example, describe, natural, disasters, like, earthquakes, and, tsunamis, various, cultures, from, vancouver, island, and, washington, have, stories, describing, a, physical, struggle, between, a, thunderbird, and, a, whale, one, such, story, tells, of, the, thunderbird, which, can, create, thunder, by, moving, just, a, feather, piercing, the, whale, s, flesh, with, its, talons, causing, the, whale, to, dive, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, bringing, the, thunderbird, with, it, another, depicts, the, thunderbird, lifting, the, whale, from, the, earth, then, dropping, it, back, down, regional, similarities, in, themes, and, characters, suggests, that, these, stories, mutually, describe, the, lived, experience, of, earthquakes, and, floods, within, tribal, memory, according, to, one, story, from, the, suquamish, tribe, agate, pass, was, created, when, an, earthquake, expanded, the, channel, as, a, result, of, an, underwater, battle, between, a, serpent, and, bird, other, stories, in, the, region, depict, the, formation, of, glacial, valleys, and, moraines, and, the, occurrence, of, landslides, with, stories, being, used, in, at, least, one, case, to, identify, and, date, earthquakes, that, occurred, in, 900, ce, and, 1700, further, examples, include, arikara, origin, stories, of, emergence, from, an, underworld, of, persistent, darkness, which, may, represent, the, remembrance, of, life, in, the, arctic, circle, during, the, last, ice, age, and, stories, involving, a, deep, crevice, which, may, refer, to, the, grand, canyon, despite, such, examples, of, agreement, between, geological, and, archeological, records, on, one, hand, and, native, oral, records, on, the, other, some, scholars, have, cautioned, against, the, historical, validity, of, oral, traditions, because, of, their, susceptibility, to, detail, alteration, over, time, and, lack, of, precise, dates, the, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, considers, oral, traditions, as, a, viable, source, of, evidence, for, establishing, the, affiliation, between, cultural, objects, and, native, nations, oral, traditions, face, the, challenge, of, accurate, transmission, and, verifiability, of, the, accurate, version, particularly, when, the, culture, lacks, written, language, or, has, limited, access, to, writing, tools, oral, cultures, have, employed, various, strategies, that, achieve, this, without, writing, for, example, a, heavily, rhythmic, speech, filled, with, mnemonic, devices, enhances, memory, and, recall, a, few, useful, mnemonic, devices, include, alliteration, repetition, assonance, and, proverbial, sayings, in, addition, the, verse, is, often, metrically, composed, with, an, exact, number, of, syllables, or, morae, such, as, with, greek, and, latin, prosody, and, in, chandas, found, in, hindu, and, buddhist, texts, the, verses, of, the, epic, or, text, are, typically, designed, wherein, the, long, and, short, syllables, are, repeated, by, certain, rules, so, that, if, an, error, or, inadvertent, change, is, made, an, internal, examination, of, the, verse, reveals, the, problem, oral, traditions, can, be, passed, on, through, plays, and, acting, as, shown, in, modern, day, cameroon, by, the, graffis, or, grasslanders, who, perform, and, deliver, speeches, to, teach, their, history, through, oral, tradition, such, strategies, facilitate, transmission, of, information, without, a, written, intermediate, and, they, can, also, be, applied, to, oral, governance, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, provides, an, excellent, demonstration, of, oral, governance, in, the, law, of, the, jungle, not, only, does, grounding, rules, in, oral, proverbs, allow, for, simple, transmission, and, understanding, but, it, also, legitimizes, new, rulings, by, allowing, extrapolation, these, stories, traditions, and, proverbs, are, not, static, but, are, often, altered, upon, each, transmission, barring, any, change, to, the, overall, meaning, in, this, way, the, rules, that, govern, the, people, are, modified, by, the, whole, and, not, authored, by, a, single, entity, ancient, texts, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, were, preserved, and, transmitted, by, an, oral, tradition, for, example, the, rutis, of, hinduism, called, the, vedas, the, oldest, of, which, trace, back, to, the, second, millennium, bce, michael, witzel, explains, this, oral, tradition, as, follows, the, vedic, texts, were, orally, composed, and, transmitted, without, the, use, of, script, in, an, unbroken, line, of, transmission, from, teacher, to, student, that, was, formalized, early, on, this, ensured, an, impeccable, textual, transmission, superior, to, the, classical, texts, of, other, cultures, it, is, in, fact, something, like, a, tape, recording, not, just, the, actual, words, but, even, the, long, lost, musical, tonal, accent, as, in, old, greek, or, in, japanese, has, been, preserved, up, to, the, present, ancient, indians, developed, techniques, for, listening, memorization, and, recitation, of, their, knowledge, in, schools, called, gurukul, while, maintaining, exceptional, accuracy, of, their, knowledge, across, the, generations, many, forms, of, recitation, or, pathas, were, designed, to, aid, accuracy, in, recitation, and, the, transmission, of, the, vedas, and, other, knowledge, texts, from, one, generation, to, the, next, all, hymns, in, each, veda, were, recited, in, this, way, for, example, all, 1, 028, hymns, with, 10, 600, verses, of, the, rigveda, was, preserved, in, this, way, as, were, all, other, vedas, including, the, principal, upanishads, as, well, as, the, vedangas, each, text, was, recited, in, a, number, of, ways, to, ensure, that, the, different, methods, of, recitation, acted, as, a, cross, check, on, the, other, pierre, sylvain, filliozat, summarizes, this, as, these, extraordinary, retention, techniques, guaranteed, an, accurate, ruti, fixed, across, the, generations, not, just, in, terms, of, unaltered, word, order, but, also, in, terms, of, sound, that, these, methods, have, been, effective, is, testified, to, by, the, preservation, of, the, most, ancient, indian, religious, text, the, gveda, c, 1500, bce, research, by, milman, parry, and, albert, lord, indicates, that, the, verse, of, the, greek, poet, homer, has, been, passed, down, not, by, rote, memorization, but, by, oral, formulaic, composition, in, this, process, extempore, composition, is, aided, by, use, of, stock, phrases, or, formulas, expressions, that, are, used, regularly, under, the, same, metrical, conditions, to, express, a, particular, essential, idea, in, the, case, of, the, work, of, homer, formulas, included, eos, rhododaktylos, rosy, fingered, dawn, and, oinops, pontos, winedark, sea, which, fit, in, a, modular, fashion, into, the, poetic, form, in, this, case, six, colon, greek, hexameter, since, the, development, of, this, theory, of, oral, formulaic, composition, has, been, found, in, many, different, time, periods, and, many, different, cultures, and, according, to, another, source, john, miles, foley, touch, on, over, 100, ancient, medieval, and, modern, traditions, the, most, recent, of, the, world, s, major, religions, islam, claims, two, major, sources, of, divine, revelation, the, quran, and, hadith, compiled, in, written, form, relatively, shortly, after, being, revealed, the, oral, milieu, in, which, the, sources, were, revealed, and, their, oral, form, in, general, are, important, the, arab, poetry, that, preceded, the, quran, and, the, hadith, were, orally, transmitted, few, arabs, were, literate, at, the, time, and, paper, was, not, available, in, the, middle, east, the, written, quran, is, said, to, have, been, created, in, part, through, memorization, by, muhammad, s, companions, and, the, decision, to, create, a, standard, written, work, is, said, to, have, come, after, the, death, in, battle, yamama, of, a, large, number, of, muslims, who, had, memorized, the, work, for, centuries, copies, of, the, qurans, were, transcribed, by, hand, not, printed, and, their, scarcity, and, expense, made, reciting, the, quran, from, memory, not, reading, the, predominant, mode, of, teaching, it, to, others, to, this, day, the, quran, is, memorized, by, millions, and, its, recitation, can, be, heard, throughout, the, muslim, world, from, recordings, and, mosque, loudspeakers, during, ramadan, muslims, state, that, some, who, teach, memorization, recitation, of, the, quran, constitute, the, end, of, an, un, broken, chain, whose, original, teacher, was, muhammad, himself, it, has, been, argued, that, the, qur, an, s, rhythmic, style, and, eloquent, expression, make, it, easy, to, memorize, and, was, made, so, to, facilitate, the, preservation, and, remembrance, of, the, work, islamic, doctrine, holds, that, from, the, time, it, was, revealed, to, the, present, day, the, quran, has, not, been, altered, its, continuity, from, divine, revelation, to, its, current, written, form, insured, by, the, large, numbers, of, muhammad, s, supporters, who, had, reverently, memorized, the, work, a, careful, compiling, process, and, divine, intervention, muslim, scholars, agree, that, although, scholars, have, worked, hard, to, separate, the, corrupt, and, uncorrupted, hadith, this, other, source, of, revelation, is, not, nearly, so, free, of, corruption, because, of, the, hadith, s, great, political, and, theological, influence, at, least, two, non, muslim, scholars, alan, dundes, and, andrew, g, bannister, have, examined, the, possibility, that, the, quran, was, not, just, recited, orally, but, actually, composed, orally, bannister, postulates, that, some, parts, of, the, quran, such, as, the, seven, re, tellings, of, the, story, of, the, iblis, and, adam, and, the, repeated, phrases, which, of, the, favours, of, your, lord, will, you, deny, in, sura, 55, make, more, sense, addressed, to, listeners, than, readers, banister, dundes, and, other, scholars, shabbir, akhtar, angelika, neuwirth, islam, dayeh, have, also, noted, the, large, amount, of, formulaic, phraseology, in, the, quran, consistent, with, oral, formulaic, composition, mentioned, above, the, most, common, formulas, are, the, attributes, of, allah, all, mighty, all, wise, all, knowing, all, high, etc, often, found, as, doublets, at, the, end, of, a, verse, among, the, other, repeated, phrases, are, allah, created, the, heavens, and, the, earth, found, 19, times, in, the, quran, as, much, as, one, third, of, the, quran, is, made, up, of, oral, formulas, according, to, dundes, estimates, bannister, using, a, computer, database, of, the, original, arabic, words, of, the, quran, and, of, their, grammatical, role, root, number, person, gender, and, so, forth, estimates, that, depending, on, the, length, of, the, phrase, searched, somewhere, between, 52, three, word, phrases, and, 23, five, word, phrases, are, oral, formulas, dundes, reckons, his, estimates, confirm, that, the, quran, was, orally, transmitted, from, its, very, beginnings, bannister, believes, his, estimates, provide, strong, corroborative, evidence, that, oral, composition, should, be, seriously, considered, as, we, reflect, upon, how, the, qur, anic, text, was, generated, dundes, argues, oral, formulaic, composition, is, consistent, with, the, cultural, context, of, arabic, oral, tradition, quoting, researchers, who, have, found, poetry, reciters, in, the, najd, the, region, next, to, where, the, quran, was, revealed, using, a, common, store, of, themes, motives, stock, images, phraseology, and, prosodical, options, and, a, discursive, and, loosely, structured, style, with, no, fixed, beginning, or, end, and, no, established, sequence, in, which, the, episodes, must, follow, ref, group, note, scholar, saad, sowayan, referring, to, the, genre, of, saudi, arabian, historical, oral,

through, sacred, tradition, the, second, vatican, council, affirmed, in, dei, verbum, that, the, teachings, of, jesus, christ, were, initially, passed, on, to, early, christians, by, the, apostles, who, by, their, oral, preaching, by, example, and, by, observance, handed, on, what, they, had, received, from, the, lips, of, christ, from, living, with, him, and, from, what, he, did, the, catholic, church, asserts, that, this, mode, of, transmission, of, the, faith, persists, through, current, day, bishops, who, by, right, of, apostolic, succession, have, continued, the, oral, passing, of, what, had, been, revealed, through, christ, through, their, preaching, as, teachers, jan, vansina, who, specialised, in, the, history, of, central, africa, pioneered, the, study, of, oral, tradition, in, his, book, oral, tradition, as, history, 1985, vansina, differentiates, between, oral, and, literate, civilisations, depending, on, whether, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, sanctity, of, the, written, or, oral, word, in, a, society, with, the, latter, much, more, likely, to, use, oral, tradition, and, oral, literature, even, when, a, writing, system, has, been, developed, or, when, having, access, to, one, the, akan, proverbs, translated, as, ancient, things, in, the, ear, and, ancient, things, are, today, refer, to, present, day, delivery, and, the, past, content, and, as, such, oral, traditions, are, both, simultaneously, expressions, of, the, past, and, the, present, vansina, says, that, to, ignore, the, duality, either, way, would, be, reductionistic, vansina, states, members, of, literate, societies, find, it, difficult, to, shed, the, prejudice, and, contempt, for, the, spoken, word, the, counterpart, of, pride, in, writing, and, respect, for, the, written, word, any, historian, who, deals, with, oral, tradition, will, have, to, unlearn, this, prejudice, in, order, to, rediscover, the, full, wonder, of, words, the, shades, of, meaning, they, convey, to, those, who, ponder, them, and, learn, them, with, care, so, that, they, may, transmit, the, wisdom, they, contain, as, the, culture, s, most, precious, legacy, to, the, next, generation, 442, in, the, work, of, the, serb, scholar, vuk, stefanovi, karad, i, 1787, 1864, a, contemporary, and, friend, of, the, brothers, grimm, vuk, pursued, similar, projects, of, salvage, folklore, similar, to, rescue, archaeology, in, the, cognate, traditions, of, the, south, slavic, regions, which, would, later, be, gathered, into, yugoslavia, and, with, the, same, admixture, of, romantic, and, nationalistic, interests, he, considered, all, those, speaking, the, eastern, herzegovinian, dialect, as, serbs, somewhat, later, but, as, part, of, the, same, scholarly, enterprise, of, nationalist, studies, in, folklore, the, turcologist, vasily, radlov, 1837, 1918, would, study, the, songs, of, the, kara, kirghiz, in, what, would, later, become, the, soviet, union, karadzic, and, radloff, would, provide, models, for, the, work, of, parry, in, a, separate, development, the, media, theorist, marshall, mcluhan, 1911, 1980, would, begin, to, focus, attention, on, the, ways, that, communicative, media, shape, the, nature, of, the, content, conveyed, he, would, serve, as, mentor, to, the, jesuit, walter, ong, 1912, 2003, whose, interests, in, cultural, history, psychology, and, rhetoric, would, result, in, orality, and, literacy, methuen, 1980, and, the, important, but, less, known, fighting, for, life, contest, sexuality, and, consciousness, cornell, 1981, these, two, works, articulated, the, contrasts, between, cultures, defined, by, primary, orality, writing, print, and, the, secondary, orality, of, the, electronic, age, ong, s, works, also, made, possible, an, integrated, theory, of, oral, tradition, which, accounted, for, both, production, of, content, the, chief, concern, of, parry, lord, theory, and, its, reception, this, approach, like, mcluhan, s, kept, the, field, open, not, just, to, the, study, of, aesthetic, culture, but, to, the, way, physical, and, behavioral, artifacts, of, oral, societies, are, used, to, store, manage, and, transmit, knowledge, so, that, oral, tradition, provides, methods, for, investigation, of, cultural, differences, other, than, the, purely, verbal, between, oral, and, literate, societies, the, most, often, studied, section, of, orality, and, literacy, concerns, the, psychodynamics, of, orality, this, chapter, seeks, to, define, the, fundamental, characteristics, of, primary, orality, and, summarizes, a, series, of, descriptors, including, but, not, limited, to, verbal, aspects, of, culture, which, might, be, used, to, index, the, relative, orality, or, literacy, of, a, given, text, or, society, in, advance, of, ong, s, synthesis, john, miles, foley, began, a, series, of, papers, based, on, his, own, fieldwork, on, south, slavic, oral, genres, emphasizing, the, dynamics, of, performers, and, audiences, foley, effectively, consolidated, oral, tradition, as, an, academic, field, when, he, compiled, oral, formulaic, theory, and, research, in, 1985, the, bibliography, gives, a, summary, of, the, progress, scholars, made, in, evaluating, the, oral, tradition, up, to, that, point, and, includes, a, list, of, all, relevant, scholarly, articles, relating, to, the, theory, of, oral, formulaic, composition, he, also, both, established, both, the, journal, oral, tradition, and, founded, the, center, for, studies, in, oral, tradition, 1986, at, the, university, of, missouri, foley, developed, oral, theory, beyond, the, somewhat, mechanistic, notions, presented, in, earlier, versions, of, oral, formulaic, theory, by, extending, ong, s, interest, in, cultural, features, of, oral, societies, beyond, the, verbal, by, drawing, attention, to, the, agency, of, the, bard, and, by, describing, how, oral, traditions, bear, meaning, the, bibliography, would, establish, a, clear, underlying, methodology, which, accounted, for, the, findings, of, scholars, working, in, the, separate, linguistics, fields, primarily, ancient, greek, anglo, saxon, and, serbo, croatian, perhaps, more, importantly, it, would, stimulate, conversation, among, these, specialties, so, that, a, network, of, independent, but, allied, investigations, and, investigators, could, be, established, foley, s, key, works, include, the, theory, of, oral, composition, 1988, immanent, art, 1991, traditional, oral, epic, the, odyssey, beowulf, and, the, serbo, croatian, return, song, 1993, the, singer, of, tales, in, performance, 1995, teaching, oral, traditions, 1998, how, to, read, an, oral, poem, 2002, his, pathways, project, 2005, 2012, draws, parallels, between, the, media, dynamics, of, oral, traditions, and, the, internet, the, theory, of, oral, tradition, would, undergo, elaboration, and, development, as, it, grew, in, acceptance, while, the, number, of, formulas, documented, for, various, traditions, proliferated, the, concept, of, the, formula, remained, lexically, bound, however, numerous, innovations, appeared, such, as, the, formulaic, system, with, structural, substitution, slots, for, syntactic, morphological, and, narrative, necessity, as, well, as, for, artistic, invention, sophisticated, models, such, as, foley, s, word, type, placement, rules, followed, higher, levels, of, formulaic, composition, were, defined, over, the, years, such, as, ring, composition, responsion, and, the, type, scene, also, called, a, theme, or, typical, scene, examples, include, the, beasts, of, battle, and, the, cliffs, of, death, some, of, these, characteristic, patterns, of, narrative, details, like, the, arming, sequence, the, hero, on, the, beach, the, traveler, recognizes, his, goal, would, show, evidence, of, global, distribution, at, the, same, time, the, fairly, rigid, division, between, oral, and, literate, was, replaced, by, recognition, of, transitional, and, compartmentalized, texts, and, societies, including, models, of, diglossia, brian, stock, franz, b, uml, and, eric, havelock, perhaps, most, importantly, the, terms, and, concepts, of, orality, and, literacy, came, to, be, replaced, with, the, more, useful, and, apt, traditionality, and, textuality, very, large, units, would, be, defined, the, indo, european, return, song, and, areas, outside, of, military, epic, would, come, under, investigation, women, s, song, riddles, and, other, genres, the, methodology, of, oral, tradition, now, conditions, a, large, variety, of, studies, not, only, in, folklore, literature, and, literacy, but, in, philosophy, communication, theory, semiotics, and, including, a, very, broad, and, continually, expanding, variety, of, languages, and, ethnic, groups, and, perhaps, most, conspicuously, in, biblical, studies, in, which, werner, kelber, has, been, especially, prominent, the, annual, bibliography, is, indexed, by, 100, areas, most, of, which, are, ethnolinguistic, divisions, present, developments, explore, the, implications, of, the, theory, for, rhetoric, and, composition, interpersonal, communication, cross, cultural, communication, postcolonial, studies, rural, community, development, popular, culture, and, film, studies, and, many, other, areas, the, most, significant, areas, of, theoretical, development, at, present, may, be, the, construction, of, systematic, hermeneutics, and, aesthetics, specific, to, oral, traditions, the, theory, of, oral, tradition, encountered, early, resistance, from, scholars, who, perceived, it, as, potentially, supporting, either, one, side, or, another, in, the, controversy, between, what, were, known, as, unitarians, and, analysts, that, is, scholars, who, believed, homer, to, have, been, a, single, historical, figure, and, those, who, saw, him, as, a, conceptual, author, function, a, convenient, name, to, assign, to, what, was, essentially, a, repertoire, of, traditional, narrative, a, much, more, general, dismissal, of, the, theory, and, its, implications, simply, described, it, as, unprovable, some, scholars, mainly, outside, the, field, of, oral, tradition, represent, either, dismissively, or, with, approval, this, body, of, theoretical, work, as, reducing, the, great, epics, to, children, s, party, games, like, telephone, or, chinese, whispers, while, games, provide, amusement, by, showing, how, messages, distort, content, via, uncontextualized, transmission, parry, s, supporters, argue, that, the, theory, of, oral, tradition, reveals, how, oral, methods, optimized, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, and, thus, improved, the, quality, stability, and, integrity, of, content, transmission, there, were, disputes, concerning, particular, findings, of, the, theory, for, example, those, trying, to, support, or, refute, crowne, s, hypothesis, found, the, hero, on, the, beach, formula, in, numerous, old, english, poems, similarly, it, was, also, discovered, in, other, works, of, germanic, origin, middle, english, poetry, and, even, an, icelandic, prose, saga, j, a, dane, in, an, article, characterized, as, polemics, without, rigor, claimed, that, the, appearance, of, the, theme, in, ancient, greek, poetry, a, tradition, without, known, connection, to, the, germanic, invalidated, the, notion, of, an, autonomous, theme, in, the, baggage, of, an, oral, poet, within, homeric, studies, specifically, lord, s, the, singer, of, tales, which, focused, on, problems, and, questions, that, arise, in, conjunction, with, applying, oral, formulaic, theory, to, problematic, texts, such, as, the, iliad, odyssey, and, even, beowulf, influenced, nearly, all, of, the, articles, written, on, homer, and, oral, formulaic, composition, thereafter, however, in, response, to, lord, geoffrey, kirk, published, the, songs, of, homer, questioning, lord, s, extension, of, the, oral, formulaic, nature, of, serbian, and, croatian, literature, the, area, from, which, the, theory, was, first, developed, to, homeric, epic, kirk, argues, that, homeric, poems, differ, from, those, traditions, in, their, metrical, strictness, formular, system, and, creativity, in, other, words, kirk, argued, that, homeric, poems, were, recited, under, a, system, that, gave, the, reciter, much, more, freedom, to, choose, words, and, passages, to, get, to, the, same, end, than, the, serbo, croatian, poet, who, was, merely, reproductive, shortly, thereafter, eric, havelock, s, preface, to, plato, revolutionized, how, scholars, looked, at, homeric, epic, by, arguing, not, only, that, it, was, the, product, of, an, oral, tradition, but, also, that, the, oral, formulas, contained, therein, served, as, a, way, for, ancient, greeks, to, preserve, cultural, knowledge, across, many, different, generations, adam, parry, in, his, 1966, work, have, we, homer, s, iliad, theorized, the, existence, of, the, most, fully, developed, oral, poet, to, his, time, a, person, who, could, at, his, discretion, creatively, and, intellectually, create, nuanced, characters, in, the, context, of, the, accepted, traditional, story, in, fact, he, discounted, the, serbo, croatian, tradition, to, an, unfortunate, extent, choosing, to, elevate, the, greek, model, of, oral, tradition, above, all, others, lord, reacted, to, kirk, s, and, parry, s, essays, with, homer, as, oral, poet, published, in, 1968, which, reaffirmed, lord, s, belief, in, the, relevance, of, yugoslav, poetry, and, its, similarities, to, homer, and, downplayed, the, intellectual, and, literary, role, of, the, reciters, of, homeric, epic, many, of, the, criticisms, of, the, theory, have, been, absorbed, into, the, evolving, field, as, useful, refinements, and, modifications, for, example, in, what, foley, called, a, pivotal, contribution, larry, benson, introduced, the, concept, of, written, formulaic, to, describe, the, status, of, some, anglo, saxon, poetry, which, while, demonstrably, written, contains, evidence, of, oral, influences, including, heavy, reliance, on, formulas, and, themes, a, number, of, individual, scholars, in, many, areas, continue, to, have, misgivings, about, the, applicability, of, the, theory, or, the, aptness, of, the, south, slavic, comparison, and, particularly, what, they, regard, as, its, implications, for, the, creativity, which, may, legitimately, be, attributed, to, the, individual, artist, however, at, present, there, seems, to, be, little, systematic, or, theoretically, coordinated, challenge, to, the, fundamental, tenets, of, the, theory, as, foley, put, it, there, have, been, numerous, suggestions, for, revisions, or, modifications, of, the, theory, but, the, majority, of, controversies, have, generated, further, understanding, many, historians, particularly, those, trained, in, europe, will, vehemently, argue, against, the, use, of, oral, tradition, as, a, reliable, source, in, professional, education, and, research, however, this, belief, often, directly, corresponds, with, a, dismissive, attitude, towards, african, and, native, american, stories, considering, them, useful, to, anthropologists, but, not, to, fact, driven, historians, babatunde, 19, this, misconception, is, surrounded, by, the, fact, that, there, are, limited, physical, materials, available, to, confirm, or, deny, these, oral, histories, but, that, does, not, deem, them, irrelevant, a, variety, of, different, communities, throughout, the, continent, of, africa, successfully, used, oral, tradition, to, share, information, and, reconstruct, massive, collections, of, histories, due, to, a, limited, writing, accessibility, before, the, europeans, arrived, certain, non, literate, societies, still, exist, today, and, maintain, a, dependence, on, oral, sources, to, communicate, with, each, other, carry, on, customs, traditions, folklore, etc, oral, traditions, in, these, cultures, are, an, invaluable, source, of, comfort, authority, spiritual, validation, and, represent, a, psychological, release, from, what, might, be, difficult, social, and, institutional, circumstances, babatunde, 18, not, only, is, oral, tradition, itself, a, method, of, analyzing, cultural, and, social, differences, it, is, also, the, manner, in, which, stories, are, told, the, storytellers, themselves, the, endurance, of, specific, tales, throughout, time, their, general, structure, and, so, much, more, that, provides, sharp, insight, into, who, these, people, are, and, how, they, have, lived, for, centuries, this, complex, understanding, facilitates, a, much, more, thorough, understanding, of, history, anything, material, or, immaterial, that, bears, witness, to, the, past, is, a, historical, document, or, source, babatunde, 18, oral, tradition, connects, the, future, to, the, past, and, has, been, honored, in, african, countries, as, sophisticated, historical, scholarship, and, used, in, many, research, studies, this, broad, definition, of, a, historical, source, forces, archivists, to, redesign, their, perspective, on, what, constitutes, historical, research, and, expand, their, view, to, include, the, voices, of, those, who, have, little, more, than, their, own, stories, to, share, with, the, rest, of, the, world, this, condemns, the, overlooking, of, african, oral, sources, and, challenges, the, preconceptions, held, within, western, education, and, formal, institutions, most, arguments, against, the, use, of, oral, tradition, as, a, reliable, source, for, historical, writing, reference, a, lack, of, chronological, precision, and, uncertainty, about, specific, dates, and, times, these, events, may, have, occurred, this, can, lead, to, misinterpretations, or, incorrect, historical, conclusions, as, a, result, of, not, having, an, accurate, timeline, oral, tradition, has, been, subject, to, distortion, over, time, and, has, produced, incorrect, information, however, the, transformation, of, oral, tradition, can, provide, information, in, itself, regarding, the, transformation, of, a, community, this, can, also, allow, the, researcher, to, measure, varying, social, attitudes, and, customs, over, time, from, the, changes, seen, in, storytelling, refusal, of, western, trained, historians, to, acknowledge, the, validity, of, oral, tradition, in, regions, and, communities, that, have, been, historically, oppressed, and, underrepresented, throughout, history, is, not, a, coincidence, but, a, form, of, institutional, erasure, of, ethnic, cultures, factors, include, racial, superiority, and, failure, to, appreciate, diverse, ethnic, cultures, it, is, important, as, a, historian, to, understand, the, potential, shortcomings, or, obstacles, one, might, face, when, using, oral, tradition, as, an, educational, source, babatunde, 19, during, the, process, the, researcher, may, have, trouble, placing, certain, events, or, differentiating, between, similar, stories, that, may, exist, within, one, tribe, the, transmission, of, oral, histories, across, generations, typically, makes, them, more, sensitive, to, inaccuracies, or, discrepancies, that, cause, greater, difficulty, when, working, with, them, it, is, necessary, to, maintain, patience, and, devote, a, significant, amount, of, time, to, deciphering, oral, tradition, as, a, result, of, the, widespread, overlooking, of, these, oral, traditions, there, are, endless, opportunities, for, discovery, and, further, research, into, how, oral, tradition, has, formed, these, civilizations, and, correspond, to, other, parts, of, history, this, field, of, exploration, can, open, doors, to, revolutionary, findings, or, expose, even, more, crime, committed, against, the, british, and, american, imperial, governments, this, is, a, largely, untapped, pool, of, incredibly, rich, and, fascinating, culture, that, should, be, further, explored, but, is, unfortunately, neglected, by, much, of, the, western, world
