second, language, in, eastern, germany, northern, czech, republic, and, slovakia, western, parts, of, belarus, and, ukraine, as, well, as, in, southeast, lithuania, and, latvia, because, of, the, emigration, from, poland, during, different, time, periods, most, notably, after, world, war, ii, millions, of, polish, speakers, can, also, be, found, in, countries, such, as, canada, argentina, brazil, israel, australia, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, polish, began, to, emerge, as, a, distinct, language, around, the, 10th, century, the, process, largely, triggered, by, the,

transfers, 1944, 46, poles, settled, in, the, recovered, territories, in, the, west, and, north, which, had, previously, been, mostly, german, speaking, some, poles, remained, in, the, previously, polish, ruled, territories, in, the, east, that, were, annexed, by, the, ussr, resulting, in, the, present, day, polish, speaking, communities, in, lithuania, belarus, and, ukraine, although, many, poles, were, expelled, from, those, areas, to, areas, within, poland, s, new, borders, to, the, east, of, poland, the, most, significant, polish, minority, lives, in, a, long, strip, along, either,

of, ukrainian, minorities, in, the, recovered, territories, in, the, west, of, the, country, contributed, to, the, country, s, linguistic, homogeneity, the, inhabitants, of, different, regions, of, poland, still, speak, polish, somewhat, differently, although, the, differences, between, modern, day, vernacular, varieties, and, standard, polish, j, zyk, og, lnopolski, appear, relatively, slight, most, of, the, middle, aged, and, young, speak, vernaculars, close, to, standard, polish, while, the, traditional, dialects, are, preserved, among, older, people, in, rural, areas, first, language, speakers, of, polish, have, no, trouble, understanding, each, other, and, non, native, speakers, may, have, difficulty, recognizing, the, regional, and, social, differences, the, modern, standard, dialect, often, termed, as, correct, polish, is, spoken, or, at, least, understood, throughout, the, entire, country, polish, has, traditionally, been, described, as, consisting, of, three, to, five, main, regional, dialects, silesian, and, kashubian, spoken, in, upper, silesia, and, pomerania, respectively, are, thought, of, as, either, polish, dialects, or, distinct, languages, depending, on, the, criteria, used, kashubian, contains, a, number, of, features, not, found, elsewhere, in, poland, e, g, nine, distinct, oral, vowels, vs, the, six, of, standard, polish, and, in, the, northern, dialects, phonemic, word, stress, an, archaic, feature, preserved, from, common, slavic, times, and, not, found, anywhere, else, among, the, west, slavic, languages, however, it, was, described, by, some, linguists, as, lacking, most, of, the, linguistic, and, social, determinants, of, language, hood, many, linguistic, sources, categorize, silesian, as, a, regional, language, separate, from, polish, while, some, consider, silesian, to, be, a, dialect, of, polish, many, silesians, consider, themselves, a, separate, ethnicity, and, have, been, advocating, for, the, recognition, of, silesian, as, a, regional, language, in, poland, the, law, recognizing, it, as, such, was, passed, by, the, sejm, and, senate, in, april, 2024, but, has, been, vetoed, by, president, andrzej, duda, in, late, may, of, 2024, according, to, the, last, official, census, in, poland, in, 2011, over, half, a, million, people, declared, silesian, as, their, native, language, many, sociolinguists, e, g, tomasz, kamusella, agnieszka, pianka, alfred, f, majewicz, tomasz, wicherkiewicz, assume, that, extralinguistic, criteria, decide, whether, a, lect, is, an, independent, language, or, a, dialect, speakers, of, the, speech, variety, or, and, political, decisions, and, this, is, dynamic, i, e, it, changes, over, time, also, research, organizations, such, as, sil, international, and, resources, for, the, academic, field, of, linguistics, such, as, ethnologue, linguist, list, and, others, for, example, the, ministry, of, administration, and, digitization, recognized, the, silesian, language, in, july, 2007, the, silesian, language, was, recognized, by, iso, and, was, attributed, an, iso, code, of, szl, some, additional, characteristic, but, less, widespread, regional, dialects, include, polish, linguistics, has, been, characterized, by, a, strong, strive, towards, promoting, prescriptive, ideas, of, language, intervention, and, usage, uniformity, along, with, normatively, oriented, notions, of, language, correctness, unusual, by, western, standards, polish, has, six, oral, vowels, seven, oral, vowels, in, written, form, which, are, all, monophthongs, and, two, nasal, vowels, the, oral, vowels, are, i, spelled, i, spelled, y, and, also, transcribed, as, or, spelled, e, a, spelled, a, spelled, o, and, u, spelled, u, and, as, separate, letters, the, nasal, vowels, are, w, spelled, and, w, spelled, unlike, czech, or, slovak, polish, does, not, retain, phonemic, vowel, length, the, letter, which, formerly, represented, lengthened, in, older, forms, of, the, language, is, now, vestigial, and, instead, corresponds, to, u, the, polish, consonant, system, shows, more, complexity, its, characteristic, features, include, the, series, of, affricate, and, palatal, consonants, that, resulted, from, four, proto, slavic, palatalizations, and, two, further, palatalizations, that, took, place, in, polish, the, full, set, of, consonants, together, with, their, most, common, spellings, can, be, presented, as, follows, although, other, phonological, analyses, exist, neutralization, occurs, between, voiced, voiceless, consonant, pairs, in, certain, environments, at, the, end, of, words, where, devoicing, occurs, and, in, certain, consonant, clusters, where, assimilation, occurs, for, details, see, voicing, and, devoicing, in, the, article, on, polish, phonology, most, polish, words, are, paroxytones, that, is, the, stress, falls, on, the, second, to, last, syllable, of, a, polysyllabic, word, although, there, are, exceptions, polish, permits, complex, consonant, clusters, which, historically, often, arose, from, the, disappearance, of, yers, polish, can, have, word, initial, and, word, medial, clusters, of, up, to, four, consonants, whereas, word, final, clusters, can, have, up, to, five, consonants, examples, of, such, clusters, can, be, found, in, words, such, as, bezwzgl, dny, absolute, or, heartless, ruthless, d, b, o, blade, of, grass, wstrz, s, shock, and, krn, brno, disobedience, a, popular, polish, tongue, twister, from, a, verse, by, jan, brzechwa, is, w, szczebrzeszynie, chrz, szcz, brzmi, w, trzcinie, in, szczebrzeszyn, a, beetle, buzzes, in, the, reed, unlike, languages, such, as, czech, polish, does, not, have, syllabic, consonants, the, nucleus, of, a, syllable, is, always, a, vowel, the, consonant, j, is, restricted, to, positions, adjacent, to, a, vowel, it, also, cannot, precede, the, letter, y, the, predominant, stress, pattern, in, polish, is, penultimate, stress, in, a, word, of, more, than, one, syllable, the, next, to, last, syllable, is, stressed, alternating, preceding, syllables, carry, secondary, stress, e, g, in, a, four, syllable, word, where, the, primary, stress, is, on, the, third, syllable, there, will, be, secondary, stress, on, the, first, each, vowel, represents, one, syllable, although, the, letter, i, normally, does, not, represent, a, vowel, when, it, precedes, another, vowel, it, represents, j, palatalization, of, the, preceding, consonant, or, both, depending, on, analysis, also, the, letters, u, and, i, sometimes, represent, only, semivowels, when, they, follow, another, vowel, as, in, autor, awt, r, author, mostly, in, loanwords, so, not, in, native, nauka, na, u, ka, science, the, act, of, learning, for, example, nor, in, nativized, mateusz, ma, te, u, matthew, some, loanwords, particularly, from, the, classical, languages, have, the, stress, on, the, antepenultimate, third, from, last, syllable, for, example, fizyka, fiz, ka, physics, is, stressed, on, the, first, syllable, this, may, lead, to, a, rare, phenomenon, of, minimal, pairs, differing, only, in, stress, placement, for, example, muzyka, muz, ka, music, vs, muzyka, mu, z, ka, genitive, singular, of, muzyk, musician, when, additional, syllables, are, added, to, such, words, through, inflection, or, suffixation, the, stress, normally, becomes, regular, for, example, uniwersytet, u, i, v, rs, t, t, university, has, irregular, stress, on, the, third, or, antepenultimate, syllable, but, the, genitive, uniwersytetu, u, iv, rs, t, tu, and, derived, adjective, uniwersytecki, u, iv, rs, t, t, sk, i, have, regular, stress, on, the, penultimate, syllables, loanwords, generally, become, nativized, to, have, penultimate, stress, in, psycholinguistic, experiments, speakers, of, polish, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, sensitive, to, the, distinction, between, regular, penultimate, and, exceptional, antepenultimate, stress, another, class, of, exceptions, is, verbs, with, the, conditional, endings, by, bym, by, my, etc, these, endings, are, not, counted, in, determining, the, position, of, the, stress, for, example, zro, bi, bym, i, would, do, is, stressed, on, the, first, syllable, and, zro, bi, liby, my, we, would, do, on, the, second, according, to, prescriptive, authorities, the, same, applies, to, the, first, and, second, person, plural, past, tense, endings, my, cie, although, this, rule, is, often, ignored, in, colloquial, speech, so, zro, bi, li, my, we, did, should, be, prescriptively, stressed, on, the, second, syllable, although, in, practice, it, is, commonly, stressed, on, the, third, as, zrobi, li, my, these, irregular, stress, patterns, are, explained, by, the, fact, that, these, endings, are, detachable, clitics, rather, than, true, verbal, inflections, for, example, instead, of, ko, go, zoba, czy, li, cie, whom, did, you, see, it, is, possible, to, say, ko, go, cie, zoba, czy, li, here, kogo, retains, its, usual, stress, first, syllable, in, spite, of, the, attachment, of, the, clitic, reanalysis, of, the, endings, as, inflections, when, attached, to, verbs, causes, the, different, colloquial, stress, patterns, these, stress, patterns, are, considered, part, of, a, usable, norm, of, standard, polish, in, contrast, to, the, model, high, norm, some, common, word, combinations, are, stressed, as, if, they, were, a, single, word, this, applies, in, particular, to, many, combinations, of, preposition, plus, a, personal, pronoun, such, as, do, niej, to, her, na, nas, on, us, prze, ze, mnie, because, of, me, all, stressed, on, the, bolded, syllable, the, polish, alphabet, derives, from, the, latin, script, but, includes, certain, additional, letters, formed, using, diacritics, the, polish, alphabet, was, one, of, three, major, forms, of, latin, based, orthography, developed, for, western, and, some, south, slavic, languages, the, others, being, czech, orthography, and, croatian, orthography, the, last, of, these, being, a, 19th, century, invention, trying, to, make, a, compromise, between, the, first, two, kashubian, uses, a, polish, based, system, slovak, uses, a, czech, based, system, and, slovene, follows, the, croatian, one, the, sorbian, languages, blend, the, polish, and, the, czech, ones, historically, poland, s, once, diverse, and, multi, ethnic, population, utilized, many, forms, of, scripture, to, write, polish, for, instance, lipka, tatars, and, muslims, inhabiting, the, eastern, parts, of, the, former, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, wrote, polish, in, the, arabic, alphabet, the, cyrillic, script, is, used, to, a, certain, extent, today, by, polish, speakers, in, western, belarus, especially, for, religious, texts, the, diacritics, used, in, the, polish, alphabet, are, the, kreska, graphically, similar, to, the, acute, accent, over, the, letters, and, through, the, letter, in, the, kropka, superior, dot, over, the, letter, and, the, ogonek, little, tail, under, the, letters, the, letters, q, v, x, are, used, only, in, foreign, words, and, names, polish, orthography, is, largely, phonemic, there, is, a, consistent, correspondence, between, letters, or, digraphs, and, trigraphs, and, phonemes, for, exceptions, see, below, the, letters, of, the, alphabet, and, their, normal, phonemic, values, are, listed, in, the, following, table, the, following, digraphs, and, trigraphs, are, used, voiced, consonant, letters, frequently, come, to, represent, voiceless, sounds, as, shown, in, the, tables, this, occurs, at, the, end, of, words, and, in, certain, clusters, due, to, the, neutralization, mentioned, in, the, phonology, section, above, occasionally, also, voiceless, consonant, letters, can, represent, voiced, sounds, in, clusters, the, spelling, rule, for, the, palatal, sounds, t, d, and, is, as, follows, before, the, vowel, i, the, plain, letters, s, z, c, dz, n, are, used, before, other, vowels, the, combinations, si, zi, ci, dzi, ni, are, used, when, not, followed, by, a, vowel, the, diacritic, forms, d, are, used, for, example, the, s, in, siwy, grey, haired, the, si, in, siarka, sulfur, and, the, in, wi, ty, holy, all, represent, the, sound, the, exceptions, to, the, above, rule, are, certain, loanwords, from, latin, italian, french, russian, or, english, where, s, before, i, is, pronounced, as, s, e, g, sinus, sinologia, do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do, saint, simon, i, saint, simoni, ci, sierio, a, siergiej, singapur, singiel, in, other, loanwords, the, vowel, i, is, changed, to, y, e, g, syria, sybir, synchronizacja, syrakuzy, the, following, table, shows, the, correspondence, between, the, sounds, and, spelling, digraphs, and, trigraphs, are, used, similar, principles, apply, to, k, x, and, l, except, that, these, can, only, occur, before, vowels, so, the, spellings, are, k, g, c, h, l, before, i, and, ki, gi, c, hi, li, otherwise, most, polish, speakers, however, do, not, consider, palatalization, of, k, g, c, h, or, l, as, creating, new, sounds, except, in, the, cases, mentioned, above, the, letter, i, if, followed, by, another, vowel, in, the, same, word, usually, represents, j, yet, a, palatalization, of, the, previous, consonant, is, always, assumed, the, reverse, case, where, the, consonant, remains, unpalatalized, but, is, followed, by, a, palatalized, consonant, is, written, by, using, j, instead, of, i, for, example, zje, to, eat, up, the, letters, and, when, followed, by, plosives, and, affricates, represent, an, oral, vowel, followed, by, a, nasal, consonant, rather, than, a, nasal, vowel, for, example, in, d, b, oak, is, pronounced, and, in, t, cza, rainbow, is, pronounced, the, nasal, assimilates, to, the, following, consonant, when, followed, by, l, or, for, example, przyj, li, przyj, y, is, pronounced, as, just, e, when, is, at, the, end, of, the, word, it, is, often, pronounced, as, just, depending, on, the, word, the, phoneme, x, can, be, spelt, h, or, ch, the, phoneme, can, be, spelt, or, rz, and, u, can, be, spelt, u, or, in, several, cases, it, determines, the, meaning, for, example, mo, e, maybe, and, morze, sea, in, occasional, words, letters, that, normally, form, a, digraph, are, pronounced, separately, for, example, rz, represents, rz, not, in, words, like, zamarza, freeze, and, in, the, name, tarzan, doubled, letters, are, usually, pronounced, as, a, single, lengthened, consonant, however, some, speakers, might, pronounce, the, combination, as, two, separate, sounds, there, are, certain, clusters, where, a, written, consonant, would, not, be, pronounced, for, example, the, in, the, word, jab, ko, apple, might, be, omitted, in, ordinary, speech, leading, to, the, pronunciation, japko, polish, is, a, highly, fusional, language, with, relatively, free, word, order, although, the, dominant, arrangement, is, subject, verb, object, svo, there, are, no, articles, and, subject, pronouns, are, often, dropped, nouns,
