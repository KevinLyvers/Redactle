an, endangered, language, or, moribund, language, is, a, language, that, is, at, risk, of, disappearing, as, its, speakers, die, out, or, shift, to, speaking, other, languages, language, loss, occurs, when, the, language, has, no, more, native, speakers, and, becomes, a, dead, language, if, no, one, can, speak, the, language, at, all, it, becomes, an, extinct, language, a, dead, language, may, still, be, studied, through, recordings, or, writings, but, it, is, still, dead, or, extinct, unless, there, are, fluent, speakers, although, languages, have, always, become, extinct, throughout, human, history, they, are, currently, dying, at, an, accelerated, rate, because, of, globalization, mass, migration, cultural, replacement, imperialism, neocolonialism, and, linguicide, language, killing, language, shift, most, commonly, occurs, when, speakers, switch, to, a, language, associated, with, social, or, economic, power, or, one, spoken, more, widely, leading, to, the, gradual, decline, and, eventual, death, of, the, endangered, language, the, process, of, language, shift, is, often, influenced, by, factors, such, as, globalisation, economic, authorities, and, the, perceived, prestige, of, certain, languages, the, ultimate, result, is, the, loss, of, linguistic, diversity, and, cultural, heritage, within, affected, communities, the, general, consensus, is, that, there, are, between, 6, 000, and, 7, 000, languages, currently, spoken, some, linguists, estimate, that, between, 50, and, 90, of, them, will, be, severely, endangered, or, dead, by, the, year, 2100, the, 20, most, common, languages, each, with, more, than, 50, million, speakers, are, spoken, by, 50, of, the, world, s, population, but, most, languages, are, spoken, by, fewer, than, 10, 000, people, the, first, step, towards, language, death, is, potential, endangerment, this, is, when, a, language, faces, strong, external, pressure, but, there, are, still, communities, of, speakers, who, pass, the, language, to, their, children, the, second, stage, is, endangerment, once, a, language, has, reached, the, endangerment, stage, there, are, only, a, few, speakers, left, and, children, are, for, the, most, part, not, learning, the, language, the, third, stage, of, language, extinction, is, seriously, endangered, during, this, stage, a, language, is, unlikely, to, survive, another, generation, and, will, soon, be, extinct, the, fourth, stage, is, moribund, followed, by, the, fifth, stage, extinction, many, projects, are, under, way, aimed, at, preventing, or, slowing, language, loss, by, revitalizing, endangered, languages, and, promoting, education, and, literacy, in, minority, languages, often, involving, joint, projects, between, language, communities, and, linguists, across, the, world, many, countries, have, enacted, specific, legislation, aimed, at, protecting, and, stabilizing, the, language, of, indigenous, speech, communities, recognizing, that, most, of, the, world, s, endangered, languages, are, unlikely, to, be, revitalized, many, linguists, are, also, working, on, documenting, the, thousands, of, languages, of, the, world, about, which, little, or, nothing, is, known, the, total, number, of, contemporary, languages, in, the, world, is, not, known, and, it, is, not, well, defined, what, constitutes, a, separate, language, as, opposed, to, a, dialect, estimates, vary, depending, on, the, extent, and, means, of, the, research, undertaken, and, the, definition, of, a, distinct, language, and, the, current, state, of, knowledge, of, remote, and, isolated, language, communities, the, number, of, known, languages, varies, over, time, as, some, of, them, become, extinct, and, others, are, newly, discovered, an, accurate, number, of, languages, in, the, world, was, not, yet, known, until, the, use, of, universal, systematic, surveys, in, the, later, half, of, the, twentieth, century, the, majority, of, linguists, in, the, early, twentieth, century, refrained, from, making, estimates, before, then, estimates, were, frequently, the, product, of, guesswork, and, very, low, one, of, the, most, active, research, agencies, is, sil, international, which, maintains, a, database, ethnologue, kept, up, to, date, by, the, contributions, of, linguists, globally, ethnologue, s, 2005, count, of, languages, in, its, database, excluding, duplicates, in, different, countries, was, 6, 912, of, which, 32, 8, 2, 269, were, in, asia, and, 30, 3, 2, 092, in, africa, this, contemporary, tally, must, be, regarded, as, a, variable, number, within, a, range, areas, with, a, particularly, large, number, of, languages, that, are, nearing, extinction, include, eastern, siberia, central, siberia, northern, australia, central, america, and, the, northwest, pacific, plateau, other, hotspots, are, oklahoma, and, the, southern, cone, of, south, america, almost, all, of, the, study, of, language, endangerment, has, been, with, spoken, languages, a, unesco, study, of, endangered, languages, does, not, mention, sign, languages, however, some, sign, languages, are, also, endangered, such, as, alipur, village, sign, language, avsl, of, india, adamorobe, sign, language, of, ghana, ban, khor, sign, language, of, thailand, and, plains, indian, sign, language, many, sign, languages, are, used, by, small, communities, small, changes, in, their, environment, such, as, contact, with, a, larger, sign, language, or, dispersal, of, the, deaf, community, can, lead, to, the, endangerment, and, loss, of, their, traditional, sign, language, methods, are, being, developed, to, assess, the, vitality, of, sign, languages, while, there, is, no, definite, threshold, for, identifying, a, language, as, endangered, unesco, s, 2003, document, entitled, language, vitality, and, endangerment, outlines, nine, factors, for, determining, language, vitality, many, languages, for, example, some, in, indonesia, have, tens, of, thousands, of, speakers, but, are, endangered, because, children, are, no, longer, learning, them, and, speakers, are, shifting, to, using, the, national, language, e, g, indonesian, in, place, of, local, languages, in, contrast, a, language, with, only, 500, speakers, might, be, considered, very, much, alive, if, it, is, the, primary, language, of, a, community, and, is, the, first, or, only, spoken, language, of, all, children, in, that, community, asserting, that, language, diversity, is, essential, to, the, human, heritage, unesco, s, ad, hoc, expert, group, on, endangered, languages, offers, this, definition, of, an, endangered, language, when, its, speakers, cease, to, use, it, use, it, in, an, increasingly, reduced, number, of, communicative, domains, and, cease, to, pass, it, on, from, one, generation, to, the, next, that, is, there, are, no, new, speakers, adults, or, children, unesco, operates, with, four, levels, of, language, endangerment, between, safe, not, endangered, and, extinct, no, living, speakers, based, on, intergenerational, transfer, vulnerable, not, spoken, by, children, outside, the, home, definitely, endangered, children, not, speaking, severely, endangered, only, spoken, by, the, oldest, generations, and, critically, endangered, spoken, by, few, members, of, the, oldest, generation, often, semi, speakers, unesco, s, atlas, of, the, world, s, languages, in, danger, categorises, 2, 473, languages, by, level, of, endangerment, using, an, alternative, scheme, of, classification, linguist, michael, e, krauss, defines, languages, as, safe, if, it, is, considered, that, children, will, probably, be, speaking, them, in, 100, years, endangered, if, children, will, probably, not, be, speaking, them, in, 100, years, approximately, 60, 80, of, languages, fall, into, this, category, and, moribund, if, children, are, not, speaking, them, now, many, scholars, have, devised, techniques, for, determining, whether, languages, are, endangered, one, of, the, earliest, is, gids, graded, intergenerational, disruption, scale, proposed, by, joshua, fishman, in, 1991, in, 2011, an, entire, issue, of, journal, of, multilingual, and, multicultural, development, was, devoted, to, the, study, of, ethnolinguistic, vitality, vol, 32, 2, 2011, with, several, authors, presenting, their, own, tools, for, measuring, language, vitality, a, number, of, other, published, works, on, measuring, language, vitality, have, been, published, prepared, by, authors, with, varying, situations, and, applications, in, mind, according, to, the, cambridge, handbook, of, endangered, languages, there, are, four, main, types, of, causes, of, language, endangerment, causes, that, put, the, populations, that, speak, the, languages, in, physical, danger, such, as, causes, which, prevent, or, discourage, speakers, from, using, a, language, such, as, often, multiple, of, these, causes, act, at, the, same, time, poverty, disease, and, disasters, often, affect, minority, groups, disproportionately, for, example, causing, the, dispersal, of, speaker, populations, and, decreased, survival, rates, for, those, who, stay, behind, among, the, causes, of, language, endangerment, cultural, political, and, economic, marginalization, accounts, for, most, of, the, world, s, language, endangerment, scholars, distinguish, between, several, types, of, marginalization, economic, dominance, negatively, affects, minority, languages, when, poverty, leads, people, to, migrate, towards, the, cities, or, to, other, countries, thus, dispersing, the, speakers, cultural, dominance, occurs, when, literature, and, higher, education, is, only, accessible, in, the, majority, language, political, dominance, occurs, when, education, and, political, activity, is, carried, out, exclusively, in, a, majority, language, historically, in, colonies, and, elsewhere, where, speakers, of, different, languages, have, come, into, contact, some, languages, have, been, considered, superior, to, others, often, one, language, has, attained, a, dominant, position, in, a, country, speakers, of, endangered, languages, may, themselves, come, to, associate, their, language, with, negative, values, such, as, poverty, illiteracy, and, social, stigma, causing, them, to, wish, to, adopt, the, dominant, language, which, is, associated, with, social, and, economical, progress, and, modernity, immigrants, moving, into, an, area, may, lead, to, the, endangerment, of, the, autochthonous, language, dialects, and, accents, have, seen, similar, levels, of, endangerment, during, the, 21st, century, due, to, similar, reasons, language, endangerment, affects, both, the, languages, themselves, and, the, people, that, speak, them, this, also, affects, the, essence, of, a, culture, as, communities, lose, their, language, they, often, lose, parts, of, their, cultural, traditions, which, are, tied, to, that, language, examples, include, songs, myths, poetry, local, remedies, ecological, and, geological, knowledge, as, well, as, language, behaviors, that, are, not, easily, translated, furthermore, the, social, structure, of, one, s, community, is, often, reflected, through, speech, and, language, behavior, this, pattern, is, even, more, prominent, in, dialects, this, may, in, turn, affect, the, sense, of, identity, of, the, individual, and, the, community, as, a, whole, producing, a, weakened, social, cohesion, as, their, values, and, traditions, are, replaced, with, new, ones, this, is, sometimes, characterized, as, anomie, losing, a, language, may, also, have, political, consequences, as, some, countries, confer, different, political, statuses, or, privileges, on, minority, ethnic, groups, often, defining, ethnicity, in, terms, of, language, in, turn, communities, that, lose, their, language, may, also, lose, political, legitimacy, as, a, community, with, special, collective, rights, language, can, also, be, considered, as, scientific, knowledge, in, topics, such, as, medicine, philosophy, botany, and, more, it, reflects, a, community, s, practices, when, dealing, with, the, environment, and, each, other, when, a, language, is, lost, this, knowledge, is, often, lost, as, well, in, contrast, language, revitalization, is, correlated, with, better, health, outcomes, in, indigenous, communities, during, language, loss, sometimes, referred, to, as, obsolescence, in, the, linguistic, literature, the, language, that, is, being, lost, generally, undergoes, changes, as, speakers, make, their, language, more, similar, to, the, language, that, they, are, shifting, to, for, example, gradually, losing, grammatical, or, phonological, complexities, that, are, not, found, in, the, dominant, language, generally, the, accelerated, pace, of, language, endangerment, is, considered, to, be, a, problem, by, linguists, and, by, the, speakers, however, some, linguists, such, as, the, phonetician, peter, ladefoged, have, argued, that, language, death, is, a, natural, part, of, the, process, of, human, cultural, development, and, that, languages, die, because, communities, stop, speaking, them, for, their, own, reasons, ladefoged, argued, that, linguists, should, simply, document, and, describe, languages, scientifically, but, not, seek, to, interfere, with, the, processes, of, language, loss, a, similar, view, has, been, argued, at, length, by, linguist, salikoko, mufwene, who, sees, the, cycles, of, language, death, and, emergence, of, new, languages, through, creolization, as, a, continuous, ongoing, process, a, majority, of, linguists, do, consider, that, language, loss, is, an, ethical, problem, as, they, consider, that, most, communities, would, prefer, to, maintain, their, languages, if, given, a, real, choice, they, also, consider, it, a, scientific, problem, because, language, loss, on, the, scale, currently, taking, place, will, mean, that, future, linguists, will, only, have, access, to, a, fraction, of, the, world, s, linguistic, diversity, therefore, their, picture, of, what, human, language, is, and, can, be, will, be, limited, some, linguists, consider, linguistic, diversity, to, be, analogous, to, biological, diversity, and, compare, language, endangerment, to, wildlife, endangerment, linguists, members, of, endangered, language, communities, governments, nongovernmental, organizations, and, international, organizations, such, as, unesco, and, the, european, union, are, actively, working, to, save, and, stabilize, endangered, languages, once, a, language, is, determined, to, be, endangered, there, are, three, steps, that, can, be, taken, in, order, to, stabilize, or, rescue, the, language, the, first, is, language, documentation, the, second, is, language, revitalization, and, the, third, is, language, maintenance, language, documentation, is, the, documentation, in, writing, and, audio, visual, recording, of, grammar, vocabulary, and, oral, traditions, e, g, stories, songs, religious, texts, of, endangered, languages, it, entails, producing, descriptive, grammars, collections, of, texts, and, dictionaries, of, the, languages, and, it, requires, the, establishment, of, a, secure, archive, where, the, material, can, be, stored, once, it, is, produced, so, that, it, can, be, accessed, by, future, generations, of, speakers, or, scientists, language, revitalization, is, the, process, by, which, a, language, community, through, political, community, and, educational, means, attempts, to, increase, the, number, of, active, speakers, of, the, endangered, language, this, process, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, language, revival, or, reversing, language, shift, for, case, studies, of, this, process, see, anderson, 2014, applied, linguistics, and, education, are, helpful, in, revitalizing, endangered, languages, vocabulary, and, courses, are, available, online, for, a, number, of, endangered, languages, language, maintenance, refers, to, the, support, given, to, languages, that, need, for, their, survival, to, be, protected, from, outsiders, who, can, ultimately, affect, the, number, of, speakers, of, a, language, unesco, seeks, to, prevent, language, extinction, by, promoting, and, supporting, the, language, in, education, culture, communication, and, information, and, science, another, option, is, post, vernacular, maintenance, the, teaching, of, some, words, and, concepts, of, the, lost, language, rather, than, revival, proper, as, of, june, 2012, the, united, states, has, a, j, 1, specialist, visa, which, allows, indigenous, language, experts, who, do, not, have, academic, training, to, enter, the, u, s, as, experts, aiming, to, share, their, knowledge, and, expand, their, skills
