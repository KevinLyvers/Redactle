circumcision, is, a, procedure, that, removes, the, foreskin, from, the, human, penis, in, the, most, common, form, of, the, operation, the, foreskin, is, extended, with, forceps, then, a, circumcision, device, may, be, placed, after, which, the, foreskin, is, excised, topical, or, locally, injected, anesthesia, is, generally, used, to, reduce, pain, and, physiologic, stress, circumcision, is, generally, electively, performed, most, commonly, done, as, a, form, of, preventive, healthcare, as, a, religious, obligation, or, as, a, cultural, practice, it, is, also, an, option, for, cases, of, phimosis, other, pathologies, that, do, not, resolve, with, other, treatments, and, chronic, urinary, tract, infections, utis, the, procedure, is, contraindicated, in, cases, of, certain, genital, structure, abnormalities, or, poor, general, health, the, procedure, is, associated, with, reduced, rates, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, urinary, tract, infections, this, includes, reducing, the, incidence, of, cancer, causing, forms, of, human, papillomavirus, hpv, and, significantly, reducing, hiv, transmission, among, heterosexual, men, in, high, risk, populations, its, prophylactic, efficacy, against, hiv, transmission, in, the, developed, world, or, among, men, who, have, sex, with, men, is, debated, neonatal, circumcision, decreases, the, risk, of, penile, cancer, complication, rates, increase, significantly, with, age, bleeding, infection, and, the, removal, of, either, too, much, or, too, little, foreskin, are, the, most, common, acute, complications, while, meatal, stenosis, is, the, most, common, long, term, there, are, various, cultural, social, and, ethical, views, on, circumcision, major, medical, organizations, hold, variant, views, on, the, strength, of, circumcision, s, prophylactic, efficacy, in, developed, countries, some, medical, organizations, take, the, position, that, it, carries, prophylactic, health, benefits, which, outweigh, the, risks, while, other, medical, organizations, generally, hold, the, belief, that, in, these, situations, its, medical, benefits, are, not, counterbalanced, by, risk, circumcision, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, common, and, oldest, medical, procedures, prophylactic, usage, originated, in, england, during, the, 1850s, and, subsequently, widely, spread, becoming, predominately, established, as, a, way, to, prevent, sexually, transmitted, infections, beyond, use, as, a, prophylactic, or, treatment, option, in, healthcare, circumcision, plays, a, major, role, in, many, of, the, world, s, cultures, and, religions, most, prominently, judaism, and, islam, circumcision, is, among, the, most, important, commandments, in, judaism, it, is, widespread, in, australia, canada, the, united, states, south, korea, most, of, africa, and, parts, of, asia, it, is, relatively, rare, for, non, religious, reasons, in, parts, of, southern, africa, latin, america, europe, and, parts, of, asia, the, origin, of, circumcision, is, not, known, with, certainty, but, the, oldest, documentation, comes, from, ancient, egypt, around, half, of, all, circumcisions, worldwide, are, performed, for, reasons, of, prophylactic, healthcare, there, is, a, consensus, among, the, world, s, major, medical, organizations, and, in, the, academic, literature, that, circumcision, is, an, efficacious, intervention, for, hiv, prevention, in, high, risk, populations, if, carried, out, by, medical, professionals, under, safe, conditions, in, 2007, the, who, and, the, joint, united, nations, programme, on, hiv, aids, unaids, stated, that, they, recommended, adolescent, and, adult, circumcision, as, part, of, a, comprehensive, program, for, prevention, of, hiv, transmission, in, areas, with, high, endemic, rates, of, hiv, as, long, as, the, program, includes, informed, consent, confidentiality, and, absence, of, coercion, known, as, voluntary, medical, male, circumcision, or, vmmc, in, 2010, this, was, expanded, to, routine, neonatal, circumcision, as, long, as, those, undergoing, the, procedure, received, assent, from, their, parents, in, 2020, the, world, health, organization, again, concluded, that, male, circumcision, is, an, efficacious, intervention, for, hiv, prevention, and, that, the, promotion, of, male, circumcision, is, an, essential, strategy, in, addition, to, other, preventive, measures, for, the, prevention, of, heterosexually, acquired, hiv, infection, in, men, eastern, and, southern, africa, had, a, particularly, low, prevalence, of, circumcised, males, this, region, has, a, disproportionately, high, hiv, infection, rate, with, a, significant, number, of, those, infections, stemming, from, heterosexual, transmission, as, a, result, the, promotion, of, prophylactic, circumcision, has, been, a, priority, intervention, in, that, region, since, the, who, s, 2007, recommendations, the, international, antiviral, society, usa, also, suggests, circumcision, be, discussed, with, men, who, have, insertive, anal, sex, with, men, especially, in, regions, where, hiv, is, common, there, is, evidence, that, circumcision, is, associated, with, a, reduced, risk, of, hiv, infection, for, such, men, particularly, in, low, income, countries, the, finding, that, circumcision, significantly, reduces, female, to, male, hiv, transmission, has, prompted, medical, organizations, serving, communities, affected, by, endemic, hiv, aids, to, promote, circumcision, as, an, additional, method, of, controlling, the, spread, of, hiv, major, medical, organizations, hold, varying, positions, on, the, prophylactic, efficacy, of, the, elective, circumcision, of, minors, in, the, context, of, developed, countries, literature, on, the, matter, is, polarized, with, the, cost, benefit, analysis, being, highly, dependent, on, the, kinds, and, frequencies, of, health, problems, in, the, population, under, discussion, and, how, circumcision, affects, them, the, world, health, organization, who, unaids, and, american, medical, organizations, take, the, position, that, it, carries, prophylactic, health, benefits, which, outweigh, the, risks, while, european, medical, organizations, generally, hold, the, belief, that, in, these, situations, its, medical, benefits, are, not, counterbalanced, by, risk, advocates, of, circumcision, consider, it, to, have, a, net, health, benefit, and, therefore, feel, that, increasing, the, circumcision, rate, is, imperative, they, recommend, performing, it, during, the, neonatal, period, when, it, is, less, expensive, and, has, a, lower, risk, of, complications, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, and, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, stated, that, the, potential, benefits, of, circumcision, outweigh, the, risks, the, world, health, organization, in, 2010, stated, there, are, significant, benefits, in, performing, male, circumcision, in, early, infancy, and, programmes, that, promote, early, infant, male, circumcision, are, likely, to, have, lower, morbidity, rates, and, lower, costs, than, programmes, targeting, adolescent, boys, and, men, circumcision, is, also, used, to, treat, various, pathologies, these, include, pathological, phimosis, refractory, balanoposthitis, and, chronic, or, recurrent, urinary, tract, infections, utis, circumcision, is, contraindicated, in, certain, cases, these, include, infants, with, certain, genital, structure, abnormalities, such, as, a, misplaced, urethral, opening, as, in, hypospadias, and, epispadias, curvature, of, the, head, of, the, penis, chordee, or, ambiguous, genitalia, because, the, foreskin, may, be, needed, for, reconstructive, surgery, circumcision, is, contraindicated, in, premature, infants, and, those, who, are, not, clinically, stable, and, in, good, health, if, an, individual, is, known, to, have, or, has, a, family, history, of, serious, bleeding, disorders, such, as, hemophilia, it, is, recommended, that, the, blood, be, checked, for, normal, coagulation, properties, before, the, procedure, is, attempted, the, foreskin, is, the, double, layered, fold, of, tissue, at, the, distal, end, of, the, human, penis, that, covers, the, glans, and, the, urinary, meatus, for, adult, medical, circumcision, superficial, wound, healing, takes, up, to, a, week, and, complete, healing, 4, to, 6, months, for, infants, healing, is, usually, complete, within, one, week, for, infant, circumcision, devices, such, as, the, gomco, clamp, plastibell, and, mogen, clamp, are, commonly, used, in, the, usa, these, follow, the, same, basic, procedure, first, the, amount, of, foreskin, to, be, removed, is, estimated, the, practitioner, opens, the, foreskin, via, the, preputial, orifice, to, reveal, the, glans, underneath, and, ensures, it, is, normal, before, bluntly, separating, the, inner, lining, of, the, foreskin, preputial, epithelium, from, its, attachment, to, the, glans, the, practitioner, then, places, the, circumcision, device, this, sometimes, requires, a, dorsal, slit, which, remains, until, blood, flow, has, stopped, finally, the, foreskin, is, amputated, for, older, babies, and, adults, circumcision, is, often, performed, surgically, without, specialized, instruments, and, alternatives, such, as, unicirc, or, the, shang, ring, are, available, the, circumcision, procedure, causes, pain, and, for, neonates, this, pain, may, interfere, with, mother, infant, interaction, or, cause, other, behavioral, changes, so, the, use, of, analgesia, is, advocated, ordinary, procedural, pain, may, be, managed, in, pharmacological, and, non, pharmacological, ways, pharmacological, methods, such, as, localized, or, regional, pain, blocking, injections, and, topical, analgesic, creams, are, safe, and, effective, the, ring, block, and, dorsal, penile, nerve, block, dpnb, are, the, most, effective, at, reducing, pain, and, the, ring, block, may, be, more, effective, than, the, dpnb, they, are, more, effective, than, emla, eutectic, mixture, of, local, anesthetics, cream, which, is, more, effective, than, a, placebo, topical, creams, have, been, found, to, irritate, the, skin, of, low, birth, weight, infants, so, penile, nerve, block, techniques, are, recommended, in, this, group, for, infants, non, pharmacological, methods, such, as, the, use, of, a, comfortable, padded, chair, and, a, sucrose, or, non, sucrose, pacifier, are, more, effective, at, reducing, pain, than, a, placebo, but, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, aap, states, that, such, methods, are, insufficient, alone, and, should, be, used, to, supplement, more, effective, techniques, a, quicker, procedure, reduces, duration, of, pain, use, of, the, mogen, clamp, was, found, to, result, in, a, shorter, procedure, time, and, less, pain, induced, stress, than, the, use, of, the, gomco, clamp, or, the, plastibell, the, available, evidence, does, not, indicate, that, post, procedure, pain, management, is, needed, for, adults, topical, anesthesia, ring, block, dorsal, penile, nerve, block, dpnb, and, general, anesthesia, are, all, options, and, the, procedure, requires, four, to, six, weeks, of, abstinence, from, masturbation, or, intercourse, to, allow, the, wound, to, heal, male, circumcision, reduces, the, risk, of, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, transmission, from, hiv, positive, women, to, men, in, high, risk, populations, in, 2020, the, world, health, organization, who, reiterated, that, male, circumcision, is, an, efficacious, intervention, for, hiv, prevention, if, carried, out, by, medical, professionals, under, safe, conditions, human, papillomavirus, hpv, is, the, most, commonly, transmitted, sexually, transmitted, infection, affecting, both, men, and, women, while, most, infections, are, asymptomatic, and, are, cleared, by, the, immune, system, some, types, of, the, virus, cause, genital, warts, and, other, types, if, untreated, cause, various, forms, of, cancer, including, cervical, cancer, and, penile, cancer, genital, warts, and, cervical, cancer, are, the, two, most, common, problems, resulting, from, hpv, circumcision, is, associated, with, a, reduced, prevalence, of, oncogenic, types, of, hpv, infection, meaning, that, a, randomly, selected, circumcised, man, is, less, likely, to, be, found, infected, with, cancer, causing, types, of, hpv, than, an, uncircumcised, man, it, also, decreases, the, likelihood, of, multiple, infections, as, of, 2012, there, was, no, strong, evidence, that, it, reduces, the, rate, of, new, hpv, infection, but, the, procedure, is, associated, with, increased, clearance, of, the, virus, by, the, body, which, can, account, for, the, finding, of, reduced, prevalence, although, genital, warts, are, caused, by, a, type, of, hpv, there, is, no, statistically, significant, relationship, between, being, circumcised, and, the, presence, of, genital, warts, studies, evaluating, the, effect, of, circumcision, on, the, rates, of, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, have, generally, found, it, to, be, protective, a, 2006, meta, analysis, found, that, circumcision, was, associated, with, lower, rates, of, syphilis, chancroid, and, possibly, genital, herpes, a, 2010, review, found, that, circumcision, reduced, the, incidence, of, hsv, 2, herpes, simplex, virus, type, 2, infections, by, 28, the, researchers, found, mixed, results, for, protection, against, trichomonas, vaginalis, and, chlamydia, trachomatis, and, no, evidence, of, protection, against, gonorrhea, or, syphilis, it, may, also, possibly, protect, against, syphilis, in, msm, phimosis, is, the, inability, to, retract, the, foreskin, over, the, glans, penis, at, birth, the, foreskin, cannot, be, retracted, due, to, adhesions, between, the, foreskin, and, glans, and, this, is, considered, normal, physiological, phimosis, over, time, the, foreskin, naturally, separates, from, the, glans, and, a, majority, of, boys, are, able, to, retract, the, foreskin, by, age, three, less, than, one, percent, are, still, having, problems, at, age, 18, if, the, inability, to, do, so, becomes, problematic, pathological, phimosis, circumcision, is, a, treatment, option, this, pathological, phimosis, may, be, due, to, scarring, from, the, skin, disease, balanitis, xerotica, obliterans, bxo, repeated, episodes, of, balanoposthitis, or, forced, retraction, of, the, foreskin, steroid, creams, are, also, a, reasonable, option, and, may, prevent, the, need, for, surgery, including, in, those, with, mild, bxo, the, procedure, may, also, be, used, to, prevent, the, development, of, phimosis, phimosis, is, also, a, complication, that, can, result, from, circumcision, an, inflammation, of, the, glans, penis, and, foreskin, is, called, balanoposthitis, and, the, condition, affecting, the, glans, alone, is, called, balanitis, most, cases, of, these, conditions, occur, in, uncircumcised, males, affecting, 4, 11, of, that, group, the, moist, warm, space, underneath, the, foreskin, is, thought, to, facilitate, the, growth, of, pathogens, particularly, when, hygiene, is, poor, yeasts, especially, candida, albicans, are, the, most, common, penile, infection, and, are, rarely, identified, in, samples, taken, from, circumcised, males, both, conditions, are, usually, treated, with, topical, antibiotics, metronidazole, cream, and, antifungals, clotrimazole, cream, or, low, potency, steroid, creams, circumcision, is, a, treatment, option, for, refractory, or, recurrent, balanoposthitis, but, in, the, twenty, first, century, the, availability, of, the, other, treatments, has, made, it, less, necessary, a, uti, affects, parts, of, the, urinary, system, including, the, urethra, bladder, and, kidneys, there, is, about, a, one, percent, risk, of, utis, in, boys, under, two, years, of, age, and, the, majority, of, incidents, occur, in, the, first, year, of, life, there, is, good, but, not, ideal, evidence, that, circumcision, of, babies, reduces, the, incidence, of, utis, in, boys, under, two, years, of, age, and, there, is, fair, evidence, that, the, reduction, in, incidence, is, by, a, factor, of, 3, 10, times, 100, circumcisions, prevents, one, uti, circumcision, is, most, likely, to, benefit, boys, who, have, a, high, risk, of, utis, due, to, anatomical, defects, and, may, be, used, to, treat, recurrent, utis, there, is, a, plausible, biological, explanation, for, the, reduction, in, uti, risk, after, circumcision, the, orifice, through, which, urine, passes, at, the, tip, of, the, penis, the, urinary, meatus, hosts, more, urinary, system, disease, causing, bacteria, in, uncircumcised, boys, than, in, circumcised, boys, especially, in, those, under, six, months, of, age, as, these, bacteria, are, a, risk, factor, for, utis, circumcision, may, reduce, the, risk, of, utis, through, a, decrease, in, the, bacterial, population, not, being, circumcised, is, the, primary, risk, factor, for, penile, cancer, pre, adolescent, circumcision, has, a, strong, protective, effect, against, penile, cancer, in, later, life, penile, cancer, is, a, rare, disease, in, the, developed, world, but, much, more, prevalent, in, the, developing, world, the, penile, tissue, removed, during, circumcision, is, a, potential, origin, for, penile, cancer, risk, benefit, considerations, around, the, use, of, circumcision, as, a, cancer, preventive, measure, are, a, source, of, debate, penile, cancer, development, can, be, detected, in, the, carcinoma, in, situ, cis, cancerous, precursor, stage, and, at, the, more, advanced, invasive, squamous, cell, carcinoma, stage, there, is, an, association, between, adult, circumcision, and, an, increased, risk, of, invasive, penile, cancer, this, is, believed, to, be, from, men, being, circumcised, as, a, treatment, for, penile, cancer, or, a, condition, that, is, a, precursor, to, cancer, rather, than, a, consequence, of, circumcision, itself, penile, cancer, has, been, observed, to, be, nearly, eliminated, in, populations, of, males, circumcised, neonatally, important, risk, factors, for, penile, cancer, include, phimosis, and, hpv, infection, both, of, which, are, mitigated, by, circumcision, the, mitigating, effect, circumcision, has, on, the, risk, factor, introduced, by, the, possibility, of, phimosis, is, secondary, in, that, the, removal, of, the, foreskin, eliminates, the, possibility, of, phimosis, this, can, be, inferred, from, study, results, that, show, uncircumcised, men, with, no, history, of, phimosis, are, equally, likely, to, have, penile, cancer, as, circumcised, men, circumcision, is, also, associated, with, a, reduced, prevalence, of, cancer, causing, types, of, hpv, in, men, and, a, reduced, risk, of, cervical, cancer, which, is, caused, by, a, type, of, hpv, in, female, partners, of, men, there, is, some, evidence, that, circumcision, is, associated, with, reduced, risk, of, prostate, cancer, a, 2017, systematic, review, found, consistent, evidence, that, male, circumcision, prior, to, heterosexual, contact, was, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, of, cervical, cancer, cervical, dysplasia, hsv, 2, chlamydia, and, syphilis, among, women, the, evidence, was, less, consistent, in, regards, to, the, potential, association, of, circumcision, with, women, s, risk, of, hpv, and, hiv, the, accumulated, data, show, circumcision, does, not, have, an, adverse, physiological, effect, on, sexual, pleasure, function, desire, or, fertility, there, is, some, evidence, that, circumcision, has, no, effect, on, pain, with, intercourse, premature, ejaculation, intravaginal, ejaculation, latency, time, erectile, dysfunction, or, difficulties, with, orgasm, according, to, a, 2014, review, the, effect, of, circumcision, on, sexual, partners, experiences, is, unclear, as, this, has, not, been, well, studied, according, to, a, policy, statement, from, the, canadian, paediatric, society, that, was, reaffirmed, in, 2021, medical, studies, do, not, support, circumcision, as, having, an, impact, on, sexual, function, or, satisfaction, for, partners, of, circumcised, individuals, there, are, popular, misconceptions, that, circumcision, benefits, or, adversely, impacts, the, sexual, pleasure, of, the, circumcised, person, neonatal, circumcision, is, generally, a, safe, low, risk, procedure, when, done, by, an, experienced, practitioner, the, most, common, acute, complications, are, bleeding, infection, and, the, removal, of, either, too, much, or, too, little, foreskin, these, complications, occur, in, approximately, 0, 13, of, procedures, with, bleeding, being, the, most, common, acute, complication, in, the, united, states, minor, complications, are, reported, to, occur, in, three, percent, of, procedures, severe, complications, are, rare, a, specific, complication, rate, is, difficult, to, determine, due, to, scant, data, on, complications, and, inconsistencies, in, their, classification, complication, rates, are, greater, when, the, procedure, is, performed, by, an, inexperienced, operator, in, unsterile, conditions, or, when, the, child, is, at, an, older, age, significant, acute, complications, happen, rarely, occurring, in, about, 1, in, 500, newborn, procedures, in, the, united, states, severe, to, catastrophic, complications, including, death, are, so, rare, that, they, are, reported, only, as, individual, case, reports, where, a, plastibell, device, is, used, the, most, common, complication, is, the, retention, of, the, device, occurring, in, around, 3, 5, of, procedures, other, possible, complications, include, buried, penis, chordee, phimosis, skin, bridges, urethral, fistulas, and, meatal, stenosis, these, complications, may, be, partly, avoided, with, proper, technique, and, are, often, treatable, without, requiring, surgical, revision, the, most, common, long, term, complication, is, meatal, stenosis, this, is, almost, exclusively, seen, in, circumcised, children, it, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, ammonia, producing, bacteria, coming, into, contact, with, the, meatus, in, circumcised, infants, it, can, be, treated, by, meatotomy, effective, pain, management, should, be, used, during, the, procedure, inadequate, pain, relief, may, carry, the, risks, of, heightened, pain, response, for, newborns, newborns, that, experience, pain, due, to, being, circumcised, have, different, responses, to, vaccines, given, afterwards, with, higher, pain, scores, observed, for, adult, men, who, have, been, circumcised, there, is, a, risk, that, the, circumcision, scar, may, be, tender, there, is, no, good, evidence, that, circumcision, affects, cognitive, abilities, circumcision, is, the, oldest, known, surgical, procedure, depictions, of, circumcised, penises, are, found, in, paleolithic, art, predating, the, earliest, signs, of, trepanation, the, history, of, the, migration, and, evolution, of, circumcision, is, known, mainly, from, the, cultures, of, two, regions, in, the, lands, south, and, east, of, the, mediterranean, starting, with, central, sahara, sudan, and, ethiopia, the, procedure, was, practiced, by, the, ancient, egyptians, and, the, semites, and, then, by, the, jews, and, muslims, in, oceania, circumcision, is, practiced, by, the, australian, aboriginals, and, polynesians, there, is, also, evidence, that, circumcision, was, practiced, among, the, aztec, and, mayan, civilizations, in, the, americas, but, little, is, known, about, that, history, it, has, been, speculated, that, circumcision, originated, as, a, substitute, for, castration, of, defeated, enemies, or, as, a, religious, sacrifice, in, many, traditions, it, acts, as, a, rite, of, passage, marking, a, boy, s, entrance, into, adulthood, at, oued, djerat, in, algeria, engraved, rock, art, with, masked, bowmen, which, feature, male, circumcision, and, may, be, a, scene, involving, ritual, have, been, dated, to, earlier, than, 6000, bp, amid, the, bubaline, period, more, specifically, while, possibly, dating, much, earlier, than, 10, 000, bp, rock, art, walls, from, the, bubaline, period, have, been, dated, between, 9200, bp, and, 5500, bp, the, cultural, practice, of, circumcision, may, have, spread, from, the, central, sahara, toward, the, south, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, toward, the, east, in, the, region, of, the, nile, based, on, engraved, evidence, found, on, walls, and, evidence, from, mummies, circumcision, has, been, dated, to, at, least, as, early, as, 6000, bce, in, ancient, egypt, some, ancient, egyptian, mummies, which, have, been, dated, as, early, as, 4000, bce, show, evidence, of, circumcision, 2, 3, evidence, suggests, that, circumcision, was, practiced, in, the, middle, east, by, the, fourth, millennium, bce, when, the, sumerians, and, the, semites, moved, into, the, area, that, is, modern, day, iraq, from, the, north, and, west, the, earliest, historical, record, of, circumcision, comes, from, egypt, in, the, form, of, an, image, of, the, circumcision, of, an, adult, carved, into, the, tomb, of, ankh, mahor, at, saqqara, dating, to, about, 2400, 2300, bce, circumcision, was, possibly, done, by, the, egyptians, for, hygienic, reasons, but, also, was, part, of, their, obsession, with, purity, and, was, associated, with, spiritual, and, intellectual, development, no, well, accepted, theory, explains, the, significance, of, circumcision, to, the, egyptians, but, it, appears, to, have, been, endowed, with, great, honor, and, importance, as, a, rite, of, passage, performed, in, a, public, ceremony, emphasizing, the, continuation, of, family, generations, and, fertility, it, may, have, been, a, mark, of, distinction, for, the, elite, the, egyptian, book, of, the, dead, describes, the, sun, god, ra, as, having, circumcised, himself, circumcision, is, prominent, in, the, hebrew, bible, in, addition, to, proposing, that, circumcision, was, adopted, by, the, israelites, purely, as, a, religious, mandate, scholars, have, suggested, that, judaism, s, patriarchs, and, their, followers, adopted, circumcision, to, make, penile, hygiene, easier, in, hot, sandy, climates, as, a, rite, of, passage, into, adulthood, or, as, a, form, of, blood, sacrifice, historical, campaigns, of, ethnic, cultural, and, religious, persecution, frequently, included, bans, on, circumcision, as, a, means, of, forceful, assimilation, conversion, and, ethnocide, alexander, the, great, conquered, the, middle, east, in, the, fourth, century, bce, and, in, the, following, centuries, ancient, greek, cultures, and, values, came, to, the, middle, east, the, greeks, abhorred, circumcision, making, life, for, circumcised, jews, living, among, the, greeks, and, later, the, romans, very, difficult, restrictions, on, the, jewish, practice, by, european, governments, have, occurred, several, times, in, world, history, including, the, seleucid, empire, under, antiochus, iv, and, the, roman, empire, under, hadrian, where, it, was, used, as, a, means, of, forceful, assimilation, and, conversion, antiochus, iv, s, restriction, on, jewish, circumcision, was, a, major, factor, in, the, maccabean, revolt, hadrian, s, prohibition, has, also, been, considered, by, some, to, have, been, a, contributing, cause, of, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, according, to, silverman, 2006, these, restrictions, were, part, of, a, broad, campaign, by, the, romans, to, civilize, the, jewish, people, viewing, the, practice, as, replusive, and, analogous, to, castration, his, successor, antoninus, pius, altered, the,

look, uncircumcised, by, stretching, the, extant, parts, of, their, foreskins, this, was, considered, by, the, jewish, leaders, to, be, a, serious, problem, and, during, the, second, century, ce, they, changed, the, requirements, of, jewish, circumcision, to, call, for, the, complete, removal, of, the, foreskin, emphasizing, the, jewish, view, of, circumcision, as, intended, to, be, not, just, the, fulfillment, of, a, biblical, commandment, but, also, an, essential, and, permanent, mark, of, membership, in, a, people, a, narrative, in, the, christian, gospel, of, luke, makes, a, brief, mention, of, the, circumcision, of, jesus, but, physical, circumcision, is, not, part, of, the, received, teachings, of, jesus, circumcision, has, played, an, important, role, in, christian, history, and, theology, paul, the, apostle, reinterpreted, circumcision, as, a, spiritual, concept, arguing, literal, circumcision, to, be, unnecessary, for, gentile, converts, to, christianity, the, teaching, that, circumcision, was, unnecessary, for, membership, in, a, divine, covenant, was, instrumental, to, the, separation, of, christianity, from, judaism, while, the, circumcision, of, jesus, is, celebrated, as, a, feast, day, in, the, liturgical, calendar, of, many, christian, denominations, although, it, is, not, explicitly, mentioned, in, the, quran, early, seventh, century, ce, circumcision, is, considered, essential, to, islam, and, it, is, nearly, universally, performed, among, muslims, the, practice, of, circumcision, spread, across, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, southern, europe, with, islam, genghis, khan, and, the, following, yuan, emperors, in, china, forbade, islamic, practices, such, as, halal, butchering, and, circumcision, the, practice, of, circumcision, is, thought, to, have, been, brought, to, the, bantu, speaking, tribes, of, africa, by, either, the, jews, after, one, of, their, many, expulsions, from, european, countries, or, by, muslim, moors, escaping, after, the, 1492, reconquest, of, spain, in, the, second, half, of, the, first, millennium, ce, inhabitants, from, the, northeast, of, africa, moved, south, and, encountered, groups, from, arabia, the, middle, east, and, west, africa, these, people, moved, south, and, formed, what, is, known, today, as, the, bantu, bantu, tribes, were, observed, to, be, upholding, what, was, described, as, jewish, law, including, circumcision, in, the, 16th, century, circumcision, and, elements, of, jewish, dietary, restrictions, are, still, found, among, bantu, tribes, circumcision, is, practiced, by, some, groups, amongst, australian, aboriginal, peoples, polynesians, and, native, americans, for, aboriginal, australians, and, polynesians, circumcision, likely, started, as, a, blood, sacrifice, and, a, test, of, bravery, and, became, an, initiation, rite, with, attendant, instruction, in, manhood, in, more, recent, centuries, often, seashells, were, used, to, remove, the, foreskin, and, the, bleeding, was, stopped, with, eucalyptus, smoke, christopher, columbus, reported, circumcision, being, practiced, by, native, americans, it, probably, started, among, south, american, tribes, as, a, blood, sacrifice, or, ritual, to, test, bravery, and, endurance, and, later, evolved, into, a, rite, of, initiation, circumcision, began, to, be, advocated, as, a, means, of, prophylaxis, in, 1855, primarily, as, a, means, of, preventing, the, transmission, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, at, this, time, british, physician, jonathan, hutchinson, published, his, findings, that, among, his, venereal, disease, patients, jews, had, a, lower, prevalence, of, syphilis, hutchinson, suggested, that, circumcision, lowers, the, risk, of, contracting, syphilis, pursuing, a, successful, career, as, a, general, practitioner, hutchinson, went, on, to, advocate, circumcision, for, health, reasons, for, the, next, fifty, years, eventually, earned, a, knighthood, for, his, contributions, to, medicine, his, viewpoint, that, circumcision, was, prophylactic, against, disease, was, adopted, by, other, medical, professionals, in, 1870, orthopedic, surgeon, lewis, sayre, a, founder, of, the, american, medical, association, introduced, circumcision, in, the, united, states, as, a, purported, cure, for, several, cases, of, young, boys, presenting, with, paralysis, and, other, significant, gross, motor, problems, he, thought, the, procedure, ameliorated, such, problems, based, on, the, then, prominent, reflex, neurosis, theory, of, disease, thinking, that, a, tight, foreskin, inflamed, the, nerves, and, caused, systemic, problems, the, use, of, circumcision, to, promote, good, health, also, fit, the, germ, theory, of, disease, which, saw, validation, during, the, same, period, the, foreskin, was, thought, to, harbor, infection, causing, smegma, 106, sayre, published, works, on, the, subject, and, promoted, it, in, speeches, although, later, discredited, many, contemporary, physicians, believed, it, could, cure, reduce, or, otherwise, prevent, a, wide, ranging, array, of, perceived, medical, problems, and, social, ills, including, that, of, epilepsy, hernia, headache, masturbation, clubfoot, alcoholism, and, gout, its, popularity, spread, with, publications, such, as, peter, charles, remondino, s, history, of, circumcision, by, the, late, 19th, century, circumcision, had, become, common, throughout, the, anglophonic, world, australia, canada, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, the, union, of, south, africa, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, it, was, universally, recommended, historian, david, gollaher, proposes, that, americans, found, circumcision, appealing, not, merely, on, medical, grounds, but, also, for, its, connotations, of, science, health, and, cleanliness, newly, important, class, distinctions, in, a, country, where, 17, million, immigrants, arrived, between, 1890, and, 1914, 106, during, the, interwar, period, medical, organizations, and, doctors, in, mainland, europe, experimented, with, the, idea, of, routine, circumcision, for, prophylactic, reasons, as, well, alongside, developments, in, the, anglophonic, world, in, france, the, medical, profession, went, so, far, as, to, recommend, universal, routine, circumcision, however, prevalence, in, france, and, mainland, europe, remained, low, there, is, a, lack, of, consensus, in, the, academic, literature, on, why, this, occurred, yosha, bolnick, koyle, 2012, have, suggested, that, a, factor, in, its, anglophonic, adoption, and, dismissal, in, mainland, europe, relates, to, attitudes, towards, judaism, and, jewish, practices, while, many, of, these, anglophonic, polities, would, not, be, considered, tolerant, by, modern, standards, the, united, kingdom, had, benjamin, disraeli, a, jew, as, prime, minister, jews, in, the, united, states, were, prominent, and, generally, well, respected, while, in, australia, the, racial, issues, of, the, time, involved, primarily, aborigines, and, chinese, immigration, and, jews, were, essentially, below, the, radar, they, argue, that, once, a, substantial, proportion, of, the, male, population, circumcised, the, idea, that, it, a, jewish, practice, no, longer, relevant, in, britain, this, was, aided, by, the, fact, that, circumcision, was, well, known, to, be, as, much, a, practice, of, the, nobility, as, a, jewish, religious, rite, so, that, the, racial, religious, nexus, was, broken, these, factors, were, absent, in, continental, europe, rates, in, the, anglophonic, world, began, to, sharply, diverge, after, 1945, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, britain, implemented, a, national, health, service, douglas, gairdner, s, 1949, article, the, fate, of, the, foreskin, argued, that, the, evidence, showed, that, the, risks, outweighed, the, benefits, leading, to, a, significant, reduction, in, circumcision, incidence, within, the, united, kingdom, in, contrast, to, gairdner, american, pediatrician, benjamin, spock, argued, in, favor, of, circumcision, in, his, popular, the, common, sense, book, of, baby, and, child, care, which, led, to, rates, in, the, united, states, significantly, rising, in, the, 1970s, national, medical, associations, in, australia, and, canada, issued, recommendations, against, routine, infant, circumcision, leading, to, drops, in, the, rates, of, both, of, those, countries, the, united, states, made, similar, statements, in, the, 1970s, but, stopped, short, of, recommending, against, it, an, association, between, circumcision, and, reduced, heterosexual, hiv, infection, rates, was, first, suggested, in, 1986, experimental, evidence, was, needed, to, establish, a, causal, relationship, so, three, randomized, controlled, trials, were, commissioned, to, exclude, other, confounding, factors, trials, took, place, in, south, africa, kenya, and, uganda, all, three, trials, were, stopped, early, by, their, monitoring, boards, because, those, in, the, circumcised, group, had, a, substantially, lower, rate, of, hiv, contraction, than, the, control, group, so, it, was, considered, unethical, to, withhold, the, procedure, in, light, of, strong, evidence, of, prophylactic, efficacy, who, assessed, these, as, gold, standard, studies, and, found, strong, and, consistent, evidence, from, later, studies, that, confirmed, the, results, of, the, studies, a, scientific, consensus, subsequently, developed, that, circumcision, reduces, heterosexual, hiv, infection, rates, in, high, risk, populations, the, who, along, with, other, major, medical, organizations, have, since, promoted, circumcision, of, high, risk, populations, as, part, of, the, program, to, reduce, the, spread, of, hiv, the, male, circumcision, clearinghouse, website, was, created, in, 2009, by, who, unaids, fhi, and, avac, to, provide, evidence, based, guidance, information, and, resources, to, support, the, delivery, of, safe, male, circumcision, services, in, countries, that, choose, to, scale, up, the, procedure, as, one, component, of, comprehensive, hiv, prevention, services, the, word, circumcision, is, from, latin, circumcidere, meaning, to, cut, around, many, societies, hold, cultural, ethical, or, social, views, on, the, practice, with, perspectives, ranging, widely, in, some, cultures, males, are, generally, required, to, be, circumcised, shortly, after, birth, during, childhood, or, around, puberty, as, part, of, a, rite, of, passage, circumcision, is, commonly, practiced, in, the, jewish, and, islamic, and, druze, faiths, and, in, coptic, christianity, and, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, and, the, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, in, contrast, some, religions, such, as, mandaeism, and, hinduism, and, sikhism, strongly, prohibit, the, practice, of, routine, circumcision, circumcision, is, near, universal, among, jews, the, mitzvah, of, circumcision, on, the, eighth, day, of, life, is, considered, among, the, most, important, commandments, in, judaism, barring, extraordinary, circumstances, failure, to, undergo, the, rite, is, seen, by, followers, of, judaism, as, leading, to, a, state, of, kareth, the, extinction, of, the, soul, and, denial, of, a, share, in, the, world, to, come, reasons, for, biblical, circumcision, include, to, show, off, patrilineal, descent, sexual, fertility, male, initiation, cleansing, of, birth, impurity, and, dedication, to, god, the, basis, for, its, observance, is, found, in, the, torah, of, the, hebrew, bible, in, genesis, chapter, 17, in, which, a, covenant, of, circumcision, is, made, with, abraham, and, his, descendants, jewish, circumcision, is, part, of, the, brit, milah, ritual, to, be, performed, by, a, specialist, ritual, circumciser, a, mohel, on, the, eighth, day, of, a, newborn, son, s, life, with, certain, exceptions, for, poor, health, jewish, law, requires, that, the, circumcision, leaves, the, glans, bare, when, the, penis, is, flaccid, converts, to, conservative, and, orthodox, judaism, must, also, be, circumcised, those, who, are, already, circumcised, undergo, a, symbolic, circumcision, ritual, circumcision, is, not, required, by, judaism, for, one, to, be, considered, jewish, but, mainstream, judaism, foresees, serious, negative, spiritual, consequences, if, it, is, neglected, circumcision, is, not, considered, a, universal, moral, law, within, judaism, rather, the, commandment, to, circumcise, is, seen, as, only, applying, to, jewish, people, those, who, are, gentiles, are, believed, to, have, a, portion, in, the, world, to, come, as, long, as, they, follow, the, tenets, of, the, seven, laws, of, noah, there, are, also, certain, exceptions, for, jews, with, poor, health, according, to, traditional, jewish, law, in, the, absence, of, an, adult, free, jewish, male, expert, a, woman, a, slave, or, a, child, who, has, the, required, skills, is, also, authorized, to, perform, the, circumcision, provided, that, they, are, jewish, however, most, streams, of, non, orthodox, judaism, allow, female, mohels, called, mohalot, hebrew, the, plural, of, mohelet, feminine, of, mohel, without, restriction, in, 1984, deborah, cohen, became, the, first, certified, reform, mohelet, she, was, certified, by, the, berit, mila, program, of, reform, judaism, an, increasing, number, of, jews, in, the, united, states, have, chosen, not, to, circumcise, their, sons, all, major, rabbinical, organizations, make, the, recommendation, that, male, infants, should, be, circumcised, the, issue, of, converts, remains, controversial, in, reform, and, reconstructionist, judaism, circumcision, of, converts, is, not, mandatory, in, either, islamic, scholars, have, diverse, opinions, on, the, obligatory, nature, of, male, circumcision, with, some, considering, it, mandatory, w, jib, while, others, view, it, as, only, being, recommended, sunnah, according, to, historians, of, religion, and, scholars, of, religious, studies, the, islamic, tradition, of, circumcision, was, derived, from, the, pagan, practices, and, rituals, of, pre, islamic, arabia, although, there, is, some, debate, within, islam, over, whether, it, is, a, religious, requirement, or, mere, recommendation, circumcision, called, khitan, is, practiced, nearly, universally, by, muslim, males, islam, bases, its, practice, of, circumcision, on, the, genesis, 17, narrative, the, same, biblical, chapter, referred, to, by, jews, the, procedure, is, not, explicitly, mentioned, in, the, quran, however, it, is, a, tradition, established, by, islam, s, prophet, muhammad, directly, following, abraham, and, so, its, practice, is, considered, a, sunnah, prophet, s, tradition, and, is, very, important, in, islam, for, muslims, circumcision, is, also, a, matter, of, cleanliness, purification, and, control, over, one, s, baser, self, nafs, there, is, no, agreement, across, the, many, islamic, communities, about, the, age, at, which, circumcision, should, be, performed, it, may, be, done, from, soon, after, birth, up, to, about, age, 15, most, often, it, is, performed, at, around, six, to, seven, years, of, age, the, timing, can, correspond, with, the, boy, s, completion, of, his, recitation, of, the, whole, quran, with, a, coming, of, age, event, such, as, taking, on, the, responsibility, of, daily, prayer, or, betrothal, circumcision, may, be, celebrated, with, an, associated, family, or, community, event, circumcision, is, recommended, for, but, is, not, required, of, converts, to, islam, traditionally, circumcision, has, not, been, practiced, by, christians, for, religious, reasons, with, the, practice, being, viewed, as, succeeded, by, baptism, with, the, new, testament, chapter, acts, 15, recording, that, christianity, did, not, require, circumcision, from, new, converts, christian, denominations, generally, hold, a, neutral, position, on, circumcision, for, prophylactic, cultural, and, social, reasons, while, strongly, opposing, it, for, religious, reasons, this, includes, the, catholic, church, which, explicitly, banned, the, practice, of, religious, circumcision, in, the, council, of, florence, and, maintains, a, neutral, position, on, the, practice, of, circumcision, for, other, reasons, a, majority, of, other, christian, denominations, take, a, similar, position, on, circumcision, prohibiting, it, for, religious, observance, but, neither, explicitly, supporting, or, forbidding, it, for, other, reasons, thus, circumcision, rates, of, christians, are, predominately, determined, by, the, surrounding, cultures, in, which, they, live, in, in, some, african, and, eastern, christian, denominations, circumcision, is, an, established, practice, and, generally, boys, undergo, circumcision, shortly, after, birth, as, part, of, a, rite, of, passage, circumcision, is, near, universal, among, coptic, christians, and, they, practice, circumcision, as, a, rite, of, passage, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, calls, for, circumcision, with, near, universal, prevalence, among, orthodox, men, in, ethiopia, eritrean, orthodox, practice, circumcision, as, a, rite, of, passage, and, they, circumcise, their, sons, anywhere, from, the, first, week, of, life, to, the, first, few, year, some, christian, churches, in, south, africa, disapprove, of, the, practice, while, others, require, it, of, their, members, circumcision, is, practiced, in, some, predominantly, christian, countries, and, christian, communities, christian, communities, in, africa, some, anglosphere, countries, the, philippines, the, middle, east, south, korea, and, oceania, have, high, circumcision, rates, while, christian, communities, in, europe, and, south, america, have, low, circumcision, rates, although, none, of, these, are, performed, out, of, perceived, religious, obligation, scholar, heather, l, armstrong, writes, that, as, of, 2021, about, half, of, christian, males, worldwide, are, circumcised, with, most, of, them, being, located, in, africa, anglosphere, countries, and, the, philippines, circumcision, is, widely, practiced, by, the, druze, druze, practice, druzism, an, abrahamic, monotheistic, syncretic, and, ethnic, religion, the, procedure, is, practiced, as, a, cultural, tradition, and, has, no, religious, significance, in, the, druze, faith, there, is, no, special, date, for, this, act, in, the, druze, faith, male, druze, infants, are, usually, circumcised, shortly, after, birth, however, some, remain, uncircumcised, until, the, age, of, ten, or, older, some, druses, do, not, circumcise, their, male, children, and, refuse, to, observe, this, common, muslim, practice, like, judaism, the, religion, of, samaritanism, requires, ritual, circumcision, on, the, eighth, day, of, life, circumcision, is, forbidden, in, mandaeism, and, the, sign, of, the, jews, given, to, abraham, by, god, circumcision, is, considered, abhorrent, by, the, mandaeans, according, to, mandaean, doctrine, a, circumcised, man, cannot, serve, as, a, mandaean, priest, circumcision, is, not, required, in, yazidism, but, is, practised, by, some, yazidis, due, to, regional, customs, the, ritual, is, usually, performed, soon, after, birth, it, takes, place, on, the, knees, of, the, ker, f, approximately, godfather, with, whom, the, child, will, have, a, life, long, formal, relationship, sikhism, does, not, require, the, elective, circumcision, of, its, followers, and, strongly, criticizes, the, practice, for, example, bhagat, kabir, criticizes, the, practise, of, circumcision, in, the, hymn, of, guru, granth, sahib, some, australian, aborigines, use, circumcision, as, a, test, of, bravery, and, self, control, as, a, part, of, a, rite, of, passage, into, manhood, which, results, in, full, societal, and, ceremonial, membership, it, may, be, accompanied, by, body, scarification, and, the, removal, of, teeth, and, may, be, followed, later, by, penile, subincision, circumcision, is, one, of, many, trials, and, ceremonies, required, before, a, youth, is, considered, to, have, become, knowledgeable, enough, to, maintain, and, pass, on, the, cultural, traditions, during, these, trials, the, maturing, youth, bonds, in, solidarity, with, the, men, circumcision, is, also, strongly, associated, with, a, man, s, family, and, it, is, part, of, the, process, required, to, prepare, a, man, to, take, a, wife, and, produce, his, own, family, in, the, philippines, circumcision, is, known, as, tuli, and, is, generally, viewed, as, a, rite, of, passage, an, overwhelming, majority, of, filipino, men, are, circumcised, often, this, occurs, in, april, and, may, when, filipino, boys, are, taken, by, their, parents, the, practice, dates, back, to, the, arrival, of, islam, in, 1450, pressure, to, be, circumcised, is, even, in, the, language, one, tagalog, profanity, for, uncircumcised, is, supot, meaning, coward, literally, a, circumcised, eight, or, ten, year, old, is, no, longer, considered, a, boy, and, is, given, more, adult, roles, in, the, family, and, society, worldwide, the, large, majority, of, polities, do, not, have, specific, laws, concerning, the, circumcision, of, males, with, religious, infant, circumcision, being, legal, in, every, country, a, few, countries, have, passed, legislation, on, the, procedure, germany, allows, routine, circumcision, while, non, religious, routine, circumcision, is, illegal, in, south, africa, and, sweden, no, major, medical, organization, recommends, circumcising, all, males, and, no, major, medical, organization, recommends, banning, the, procedure, in, the, academic, literature, there, is, general, agreement, among, both, supporters, and, opponents, of, the, practice, that, an, outright, ban, would, be, predominately, ineffective, and, harmful, a, consensus, to, keep, the, procedure, within, the, purview, of, medical, professionals, is, found, across, all, major, medical, organizations, who, advise, medical, professionals, to, yield, to, some, degree, to, parental, preferences, in, their, decision, to, agree, to, circumcise, the, royal, dutch, medical, association, which, expresses, some, of, the, strongest, opposition, to, routine, neonatal, circumcision, argues, that, while, there, are, valid, reasons, for, banning, it, doing, so, could, lead, parents, who, insist, on, the, procedure, to, turn, to, poorly, trained, practitioners, instead, of, medical, professionals, during, the, 2010s, several, right, wing, nationalist, parties, prominently, called, for, the, banning, of, circumcision, gressg, rd, argued, that, politicians, that, supported, norway, s, proposed, circumcision, ban, debated, circumcision, in, a, manner, which, constituted, ethnocentrism, the, cost, effectiveness, of, circumcision, has, been, studied, to, determine, whether, a, policy, of, circumcising, all, newborns, or, a, policy, of, promoting, and, providing, inexpensive, or, free, access, to, circumcision, for, all, adult, men, who, choose, it, would, result, in, lower, overall, societal, healthcare, costs, as, hiv, aids, is, an, incurable, disease, that, is, expensive, to, manage, significant, effort, has, been, spent, studying, the, cost, effectiveness, of, circumcision, to, reduce, its, spread, in, parts, of, africa, that, have, a, relatively, high, infection, rate, and, low, circumcision, prevalence, several, analyses, have, concluded, that, circumcision, programs, for, adult, men, in, africa, are, cost, effective, and, in, some, cases, are, cost, saving, in, rwanda, circumcision, has, been, found, to, be, cost, effective, across, a, wide, range, of, age, groups, from, newborn, to, adult, with, the, greatest, savings, achieved, when, the, procedure, is, performed, in, the, newborn, period, due, to, the, lower, cost, per, procedure, and, greater, timeframe, for, hiv, infection, protection, circumcision, for, the, prevention, of, hiv, transmission, in, adults, has, also, been, found, to, be, cost, effective, in, south, africa, kenya, and, uganda, with, cost, savings, estimated, in, the, billions, of, us, dollars, over, 20, years, hankins, et, al, 2011, estimated, that, a, 1, 5, billion, investment, in, circumcision, for, adults, in, 13, high, priority, african, countries, would, yield, 16, 5, billion, in, savings, the, overall, cost, effectiveness, of, neonatal, circumcision, has, also, been, studied, in, the, united, states, which, has, a, different, cost, setting, from, africa, in, areas, such, as, public, health, infrastructure, availability, of, medications, and, medical, technology, and, the, willingness, to, use, it, a, study, by, the, cdc, suggests, that, newborn, circumcision, would, be, societally, cost, effective, in, the, united, states, based, on, circumcision, s, efficacy, against, the, transmission, of, hiv, alone, during, coitus, without, considering, any, other, cost, benefits, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, 2012, recommends, that, neonatal, circumcision, in, the, united, states, be, covered, by, third, party, payers, such, as, medicaid, and, insurance, a, 2014, review, that, considered, reported, benefits, of, circumcision, such, as, reduced, risks, from, hiv, hpv, and, hsv, 2, stated, that, circumcision, is, cost, effective, in, both, the, united, states, and, africa, and, may, result, in, health, care, savings, a, 2014, literature, review, found, that, there, are, significant, gaps, in, the, current, literature, on, male, and, female, sexual, health, that, need, to, be, addressed, for, the, literature, to, be, applicable, to, north, american,
