empress, but, not, all, states, with, aggregate, territory, under, the, rule, of, supreme, authorities, are, called, empires, or, are, ruled, by, an, emperor, nor, have, all, self, described, empires, been, accepted, as, such, by, contemporaries, and, historians, the, central, african, empire, and, some, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, in, early, england, being, examples, there, have, been, ancient, and, modern, centralized, and, decentralized, ultra, brutal, and, relatively, benign, empires, an, important, distinction, has, been, between, land, empires, made, up, solely, of, contiguous, territories, such, as, the, austrian, empire, or, the, russian, empire, and, those, created, by, sea, power, which, include, territories, that, are, remote, from, the, home, country, of, the, empire, such, as, the, carthaginian, empire, or, the, british, empire, aside, from, the, more, formal, usage, the, word, empire, can, also, refer, colloquially, to, a, large, scale, business, enterprise, e, g, a, transnational, corporation, a, political, organization, controlled, by, a, single, individual, a, political, boss, or, a, group, political, bosses, the, concept, of, empire, is, associated, with, other, such, concepts, as, imperialism, colonialism, and, globalization, with, imperialism, referring, to, the, creation, and, maintenance, of, unequal, relationships, between, nations, and, not,

aggregate, of, many, separate, states, or, territories, under, a, supreme, ruler, or, oligarchy, this, is, in, contrast, to, a, federation, which, is, an, extensive, state, voluntarily, composed, of, autonomous, states, and, peoples, an, empire, is, a, large, polity, which, rules, over, territories, outside, of, its, original, borders, definitions, of, what, physically, and, politically, constitutes, an, empire, vary, it, might, be, a, state, affecting, imperial, policies, or, a, particular, political, structure, empires, are, typically, formed, from, diverse, ethnic, national, cultural, and, religious, components, empire, and, colonialism, are, used, to, refer, to, relationships, between, a, powerful, state, or, society, versus, a, less, powerful, one, michael, w, doyle, has, defined, empire, as, effective, control, whether, formal, or, informal, of, a, subordinated, society, by, an, imperial, society, tom, nairn, and, paul, james, define, empires, as, polities, that, extend, relations, of, power, across, territorial, spaces, over, which, they, have, no, prior, or, given, legal, sovereignty, and, where, in, one, or, more, of, the, domains, of, economics, politics,

accessible, to, its, terrestrial, homeland, such, as, the, athenian, dominated, delian, league, furthermore, empires, can, expand, by, both, land, and, sea, stephen, howe, notes, that, empires, by, land, can, be, characterized, by, expansion, over, terrain, extending, directly, outwards, from, the, original, frontier, while, an, empire, by, sea, can, be, characterized, by, colonial, expansion, and, empire, building, by, an, increasingly, powerful, navy, however, sometimes, an, empire, is, only, a, semantic, construction, such, as, when, a, ruler, assumes, the, title, of, emperor, that, polity, over, which, the, ruler, reigns, logically, becomes, an, empire, despite, having, no, additional, territory, or, hegemony, examples, of, this, form, of, empire, are, the, central, african, empire, mexican, empire, or, the, korean, empire, proclaimed, in, 1897, when, korea, far, from, gaining, new, territory, was, on, the, verge, of, being, annexed, by, the, empire, of, japan, one, of, the, last, to, use, the, name, officially, among, the, last, states, in, the, 20th, century, known, as, empires, in, this, sense, were, the, central, african, empire, ethiopia, vietnam, manchukuo, russia, germany, and, korea, scholars, distinguish, empires, from, nation, states, in, an, empire, there, is, a, hierarchy, whereby, one, group, of, people, usually, the, metropole, has, command, over, other, groups, of, people, and, there, is, a, hierarchy, of, rights, and, prestige, for, different, groups, of, people, josep, colomer, distinguished, between, empires, and, nation, states, in, the, following, way, empires, originated, as, different, types, of, states, although, they, commonly, began, as, powerful, monarchies, ideas, about, empires, have, changed, over, time, ranging, from, public, approval, to, distaste, empires, are, built, out, of, separate, units, with, some, kind, of, diversity, ethnic, national, cultural, religious, and, imply, at, least, some, inequality, between, the, rulers, and, the, ruled, without, this, inequality, the, system, would, be, seen, as, a, commonwealth, many, empires, were, the, result, of, military, conquest, incorporating, the, vanquished, states, into, a, political, union, but, imperial, hegemony, can, be, established, in, other, ways, the, athenian, empire, the, roman, empire, and, the, british, empire, developed, at, least, in, part, under, elective, auspices, the, empire, of, brazil, declared, itself, an, empire, after, separating, from, the, portuguese, empire, in, 1822, france, has, twice, transitioned, from, being, called, the, french, republic, to, being, called, the, french, empire, while, it, retained, an, overseas, empire, europeans, began, applying, the, designation, of, empire, to, non, european, monarchies, such, as, the, qing, empire, and, the, mughal, empire, as, well, as, the, maratha, confederacy, eventually, leading, to, the, looser, denotations, applicable, to, any, political, structure, meeting, the, criteria, of, imperium, some, monarchies, styled, themselves, as, having, greater, size, scope, and, power, than, the, territorial, politico, military, and, economic, facts, support, as, a, consequence, some, monarchs, assumed, the, title, of, emperor, or, its, corresponding, translation, tsar, empereur, kaiser, shah, etc, and, renamed, their, states, as, the, empire, of, empires, were, seen, as, an, expanding, power, administration, ideas, and, beliefs, followed, by, cultural, habits, from, place, to, place, some, empires, tended, to, impose, their, culture, on, the, subject, states, to, strengthen, the, imperial, structure, others, opted, for, multicultural, and, cosmopolitan, policies, cultures, generated, by, empires, could, have, notable, effects, that, outlasted, the, empire, itself, most, histories, of, empires, have, been, hostile, especially, if, the, authors, were, promoting, nationalism, stephen, howe, although, himself, hostile, listed, positive, qualities, the, guaranteed, stability, security, and, legal, order, for, their, subjects, they, tried, to, minimize, ethnic, and, religious, antagonism, inside, the, empire, the, aristocracies, that, ruled, them, were, often, more, cosmopolitan, and, broad, minded, than, their, nationalistic, successors, there, are, two, main, ways, to, establish, and, maintain, an, imperial, political, structure, i, as, a, territorial, empire, of, direct, conquest, and, control, with, force, or, ii, as, a, coercive, hegemonic, empire, of, indirect, conquest, and, control, with, power, the, former, method, provides, greater, tribute, and, direct, political, control, yet, limits, further, expansion, because, it, absorbs, military, forces, to, fixed, garrisons, the, latter, method, provides, less, tribute, and, indirect, control, but, avails, military, forces, for, further, expansion, territorial, empires, e, g, the, macedonian, empire, and, byzantine, empire, tend, to, be, contiguous, areas, the, term, on, occasion, has, been, applied, to, maritime, republics, or, thalassocracies, e, g, the, athenian, and, british, empires, with, looser, structures, and, more, scattered, territories, often, consisting, of, many, islands, and, other, forms, of, possessions, which, required, the, creation, and, maintenance, of, a, powerful, navy, empires, such, as, the, holy, roman, empire, also, came, together, by, electing, the, emperor, with, votes, from, member, realms, through, the, imperial, election, stephen, howe, writes, that, with, the, exception, of, the, roman, chinese, and, perhaps, ancient, egyptian, states, early, empires, seldom, survived, the, death, of, their, founder, and, were, usually, limited, in, scope, to, conquest, and, collection, of, tribute, having, little, impact, on, the, everyday, lives, of, their, subjects, with, the, exception, of, rome, the, periods, of, dissolution, following, imperial, falls, were, equally, short, successor, states, seldom, outlived, their, founders, and, disappeared, in, the, next, and, often, larger, empire, some, empires, like, the, neo, babylonian, median, and, lydian, were, outright, conquered, by, a, larger, empire, the, historical, pattern, was, not, a, simple, rise, and, fall, cycle, rather, it, was, rise, fall, and, greater, rise, or, as, raoul, naroll, put, it, expanding, pulsation, empires, were, limited, in, scope, to, conquest, as, howe, observed, but, conquest, is, a, considerable, scope, many, fought, to, the, death, to, avoid, it, or, to, be, liberated, from, it, imperial, conquests, and, attempts, of, conquest, significantly, contributed, to, the, list, of, wars, by, death, toll, the, imperial, impact, on, subjects, can, be, regarded, as, little, but, only, on, those, subjects, who, survived, the, imperial, conquest, and, rule, we, cannot, ask, the, inhabitants, of, carthage, and, masada, for, example, whether, empire, had, little, impact, on, their, lives, we, seldom, hear, the, voices, of, subject, peoples, because, history, is, mostly, written, by, winners, but, one, rich, primary, source, of, the, subject, population, is, the, hebrew, prophetic, books, the, hatred, towards, the, ruling, empires, expressed, in, this, source, makes, impression, of, an, impact, more, serious, than, estimated, by, howe, a, classical, writer, and, adherent, of, empire, orosius, explicitly, preferred, to, avoid, the, views, of, subject, populations, and, another, classical, roman, patriot, lucan, confessed, that, words, cannot, express, how, bitterly, we, are, hated, by, subject, peoples, the, earliest, known, empire, appeared, in, southern, egypt, sometime, around, 3200, bc, southern, egypt, was, divided, by, three, kingdoms, each, centered, on, a, powerful, city, hierapolis,

imperator, was, originally, an, honorific, meaning, commander, the, title, was, given, to, generals, who, were, victorious, in, battle, thus, an, empire, may, include, regions, that, are, not, legally, within, the, territory, of, a, state, but, are, under, either, direct, or, indirect, control, of, that, state, such, as, a, colony, client, state, or, protectorate, although, historians, use,

region, in, 680, 681, remained, a, major, power, in, southeast, europe, until, its, fall, in, the, late, 14th, century, bulgaria, gradually, reached, its, cultural, and, territorial, apogee, in, the, 9th, century, and, early, 10th, century, under, prince, boris, i, and, simeon, i, when, its, early, christianization, in, 864, allowed, it, to, develop, into, the, cultural, and, literary, center, of, slavic, europe, as, well, as, one, of, the, largest, states, in, europe, thus, the, period, is, considered, the, golden, age, of, medieval, bulgarian, culture, major, events, included, the, development, of, the, cyrillic, script, at, the, preslav, literary, school, declared, official, in, 893, and, the, establishment, of, the, liturgy, in, old, church, slavonic, also, called, old, bulgarian, at, the, time, in, the, medieval, west, the, title, empire, had, a, specific, technical, meaning, that, was, exclusively, applied, to, states, that, considered, themselves, the, heirs, and, successors, of, the, roman, empire, among, these, were, the, byzantine, empire, which, was, the, actual, continuation, of, the, eastern, portion, of, the, roman, empire, the, carolingian, empire, the, largely, germanic, holy, roman, empire, and, the, russian, empire, yet, these, states, did, not, always, fit, the, geographic, political, or, military, profiles, of, empires, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, to, legitimise, their, imperium, these, states, directly, claimed, the, title, of, empire, from, rome, the, sacrum, romanum, imperium, holy, roman, empire, which, lasted, from, 800, to, 1806, claimed, to, have, exclusively, comprehended, christian, principalities, and, was, only, nominally, a, discrete, imperial, state, the, holy, roman, empire, was, not, always, centrally, governed, as, it, had, neither, core, nor, peripheral, territories, and, was, not, governed, by, a, central, politico, military, elite, hence, voltaire, s, remark, that, the, holy, roman, empire, was, neither, holy, nor, roman, nor, an, empire, is, accurate, to, the, degree, that, it, ignores, german, rule, over, italian, french, proven, al, polish, flemish, dutch, and, bohemian, populations, and, the, efforts, of, the, ninth, century, holy, roman, emperors, i, e, the, ottonians, to, establish, central, control, voltaire, s, nor, an, empire, observation, applies, to, its, late, period, in, 1204,

key, to, central, and, to, south, west, europe, respectively, mainly, for, their, geographical, location, the, reason, these, occurrences, of, batterings, were, so, important, was, because, the, ottomans, were, muslim, and, the, rest, of, europe, was, christian, so, there, was, a, sense, of, religious, fighting, going, on, this, was, not, just, a, rivalry, of, east, and, west, but, a, rivalry, between, christians, and, muslims, both, the, christians, and, muslims, had, alliances, with, other, countries, and, they, had, problems, in, them, as, well, the, flows, of, trade, and, of, cultural, influences, across, the, supposed, great, divide, never, ceased, so, the, countries, never, stopped, bartering, with, each, other, these, epochal, clashes, between, civilizations, profoundly, shaped, many, people, s, thinking, back, then, and, continues, to, do, so, in, the, present, day, modern, hatred, against, muslim, communities, in, south, eastern, europe, mainly, in, bosnia, and, kosovo, has, often, been, articulated, in, terms, of, seeing, them, as, unwelcome, residues, of, this, imperialism, in, short, as, turks, moreover, eastern, orthodox, imperialism, was,

of, the, western, half, of, the, roman, empire, is, seen, as, one, of, the, most, pivotal, points, in, all, of, human, history, this, event, traditionally, marks, the, transition, from, classical,

there, is, still, a, debate, over, the, cause, of, the, fall, of, one, of, the, largest, empires, in, history, piganiol, argues, that, the, roman, empire, under, its, authority, can, be, described, as, a, period, of, terror, holding, its, imperial, system, accountable, for, its, failure, another, theory, blames, the, rise, of, christianity, as, the, cause, arguing, that, the, spread, of, certain, christian, ideals, caused, internal, weakness, of, the, military, and, state, in, his, book, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, peter, heather, contends, that, there, are, many, factors, including, issues, of, money, and, manpower, which, produce, military, limitations, and, culminate, in, the, roman, army, s, inability, to, effectively, repel, invading, barbarians, at, the, frontier, the, western, roman, economy, was, already, stretched, to, its, limit, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, c, e, due, to, continual, conflict, and, loss, of, territory, which, in, turn, generated, loss, of, revenue, from, the, tax, base, there, was, also, the, looming, presence, of, the, persians, which, at, any, time, took, a, large, percentage, of, the, fighting, force, s, attention, at, the, same, time, the, huns, a, nomadic, warrior, people, from, the, steppes, of, asia, are, also, putting, extreme, pressure, on, the, german, tribes, outside, of, the, roman, frontier, which, gave, the, german, tribes, no, other, choice, geographically, but, to, move, into, roman, territory, at, this, point, without, increased, funding, the, roman, army, could, no, longer, effectively, defend, its, borders, against, major, waves, of, germanic, tribes, this, inability, is, illustrated, by, the, crushing, defeat, at, adrianople, in, 378, c, e, and, later, the, crossing, of, the, rhine, in, 406, c, e, in, time, an, empire, may, change, from, one, political, entity, to, another, for, example, the, holy, roman, empire, a, german, re, constitution, of, the, roman, empire, metamorphosed, into,

valid, yet, is, not, always, used, in, the, traditional, sense, one, of, widely, discussed, cases, is, the, united, states, characterizing, aspects, of, the, us, in, regards, to, its, territorial, expansion, foreign, policy, and, its, international, behavior, as, american, empire, is, common, the, term, american, empire, refers, to, the, united, states, cultural, ideologies, and, foreign, policy, strategies, the, term, is, most, commonly, used, to, describe, the, u, s, s, status, since, the, 20th, century, but, it, can, also, be, applied, to, the, united, states, world, standing, before, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, the, 20th, century, the, us, itself, was, at, one, point, a, colony, in, the, british, empire, however, founding, fathers, such, as, george, washington, noted, after, the, revolution, that, the, us, was, an, empire, in, its, infancy, and, others, like, thomas, jefferson, agreed, describing, the, constitution, as, the, perfect, foundation, for, an, extensive, empire, jefferson, in, the, 1780s, while, awaiting, the, fall, of, the, spanish, empire, said, till, our, population, can, be, sufficiently, advanced, to, gain, it, from, them, piece, by, piece, even, so, the, ideology, that, the, us, was, founded, on, anti, imperialist, principles, has, prevented, many, from, acknowledging, america, s, status, as, an, empire, this, active, rejection, of, imperialist, status, is, not, limited, to, high, ranking, government, officials, as, it, has, been, ingrained, in, american, society, throughout, its, entire, history, as, david, ludden, explains, journalists, scholars, teachers, students, analysts, and, politicians, prefer, to, depict, the, u, s, as, a, nation, pursuing, its, own, interests, and, ideals, this, often, results, in, imperialist, endeavors, being, presented, as, measures, taken, to, enhance, state, security, ludden, explains, this, phenomenon, with, the, concept, of, ideological, blinders, which, he, says, prevent, american, citizens, from, realizing, the, true, nature, of, america, s, current, systems, and, strategies, these, ideological, blinders, that, people, wear, have, resulted, in, an, invisible, american, empire, of, which, most, american, citizens, are, unaware, besides, its, anti, imperialist, principles, the, united, states, is, not, traditionally, recognized, as, an, empire, because, the, u, s, adopted, a, different, political, system, from, those, that, previous, empires, had, used, despite, the, anti, imperial, ideology, and, systematic, differences, the, political, objectives, and, strategies, of, the, united, states, government, have, been, quite, similar, to, those, of, previous, empires, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, united, states, government, attempted, to, expand, its, territory, by, any, means, necessary, regardless, of, the, supposed, motivation, for, this, constant, expansion, all, of, these, land, acquisitions, were, carried, out, by, imperialistic, means, this, was, done, by, financial, means, in, some, cases, and, by, military, force, in, others, most, notably, the, louisiana, purchase, 1803, the, texas, annexation, 1845, and, the, mexican, cession, 1848, highlight, the, imperialistic, goals, of, the, united, states, during, this, modern, period, of, imperialism, the, u, s, government, has, stopped, adding, additional, territories, where, they, permanently, and, politically, take, over, since, the, early, 20th, century, and, instead, have, established, 800, military, bases, as, their, outposts, with, this, overt, but, subtle, military, control, of, other, countries, scholars, consider, u, s, foreign, policy, strategies, to, be, imperialistic, academic, krishna, kumar, argues, that, the, distinct, principles, of, nationalism, and, imperialism, may, result, in, common, practice, that, is, the, pursuit, of, nationalism, can, often, coincide, with, the, pursuit, of, imperialism, in, terms, of, strategy, and, decision, making, stuart, creighton, miller, posits, that, the, public, s, sense, of, innocence, about, realpolitik, politics, based, on, practical, considerations, rather, than, ideals, impacts, popular, recognition, of, us, imperial, conduct, since, it, governed, other, countries, via, surrogates, these, surrogates, were, domestically, weak, right, wing, governments, that, would, collapse, without, us, support, former, president, g, w, bush, s, secretary, of, defense, donald, rumsfeld, said, we, don, t, seek, empires, we, re, not, imperialistic, we, never, have, been, this, was, said, in, the, context, of, the, international, opposition, to, the, iraq, war, led, by, the, united, states, in, manner, widely, regarded, as, imperial, in, his, book, review, of, empire, 2000, by, michael, hardt, and, antonio, negri, mehmet, akif, okur, posits, that, since, the, september, 11, attacks, in, the, united, states, the, international, relations, determining, the, world, s, balance, of, power, political, economic, military, have, been, altered, with, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, underway, historian, sidney, lens, argued, that, from, its, inception, the, us, has, used, every, means, available, to, dominate, foreign, peoples, and, states, the, same, time, eliot, a, cohen, suggested, the, age, of, empire, may, indeed, have, ended, but, then, an, age, of, american, hegemony, has, begun, regardless, of, what, one,

a, fundamental, political, dynamic, one, that, helps, explain, why, empires, cannot, be, confined, to, a, particular, place, or, era, but, emerged, and, reemerged, over, thousands, of, years, and, on, all, continents, empires, can, be, traced, as, far, back, as, the, recorded, history, goes, indeed, most, history, is, the, history, of, empires, it, is, the, nation, state, an, essentially, 19th, century, ideal, that, is, the, historical, novelty, and, that, may, yet, prove, to, be, the, more, ephemeral, entity, our, field, s, fixation, on, the, westphalian, state, has, tended, to, obscure, the, fact, that, the, main, actors, in, global, politics, for, most, of, time, immemorial, have, been, empires, rather, than, states, in, fact, it, is, a, very, distorted, view, of, even, the, westphalian, era, not, to, recognize, that, it, was, always, at, least, as, much, about, empires, as, it, was, states, almost, all, of, the, emerging, european, states, no, sooner, began, to, consolidate, than, they, were, off, on, campaigns, of, conquest, and, commerce, to, the, farthest, reaches, of, the, globe, ironically, it, was, the, european, empires, that, carried, the, idea, of, the, sovereign, territorial, state, to, the, rest, of, the, world, empire, has, been, the, historically, predominant, form, of, order, in, world, politics, looking, at, a, time, frame, of, several, millennia, there, was, no, global, anarchic, system, until, the, european, explorations, and, subsequent, imperial, and, colonial, ventures, connected, disparate, regional, systems, doing, so, approximately, 500, years, ago, prior, to, this, emergence, of, a, global, scope, system, the, pattern, of, world, politics, was, characterized, by, regional, systems, these, regional, systems, were, initially, anarchic, and, marked, by, high, levels, of, military, competition, but, almost, universally, they, tended, to, consolidate, into, regional, empires, thus, it, was, empires, not, anarchic, state, systems, that, typically, dominated, the, regional, systems, in, all, parts, of, the, world, within, this, global, pattern, of, regional, empires, european, political, order, was, distinctly, anomalous, because, it, persisted, so, long, as, an, anarchy, similarly, anthony, pagden, eliot, a, cohen, jane, burbank, and, frederick, cooper, estimate, that, empires, have, always, been, more, frequent, more, extensive, political, and, social, forms, than, tribal, territories, or, nations, have, ever, been, many, empires, endured, for, centuries, while, the, age, of, the, ancient, egyptian, chinese, and, japanese, empires, is, counted, in, millennia, most, people, throughout, history, have, lived, under, imperial, rule, empires, have, played, a, long, and, critical, part, in, human,

world, we, live, in, rome, was, evoked, as, a, model, of, splendor, and, order, into, the, twentieth, century, and, beyond, by, comparison, the, nation, state, appears, as, a, blip, on, the, historical, horizon, a, state, form, that, emerged, recently, from, under, imperial, skies, and, whose, hold, on, the, world, s, political, imagination, may, well, prove, partial, or, transitory, the, endurance, of, empire, challenges, the, notion, that, the, nation, state, is, natural, necessary, and, inevitable, political, scientist, hedley, bull, wrote, that, in, the, broad, sweep, of, human, history, the, form, of, states, system, has, been, the, exception, rather, than, the, rule, his, colleague, robert, gilpin, confirmed, this, conclusion, for, the, pre, modern, period, the, history, of, interstate, relations, was, largely, that, of, successive, great, empires, the, pattern, of, international, political, change, during, the, millennia, of, the, pre, modern, era, has, been, described, as, an, imperial, cycle, world, politics, was, characterized, by, the, rise, and, decline, of, powerful, empires, each, of, which, in, turn, unified, and, ordered, its, respective, international, system, the, recurrent, pattern, in, every, civilization, of, which, we, have, knowledge, was, for, one, state, to, unify, the, system, under, its, imperial, domination, the, propensity, toward, universal, empire, was, the, principal, feature, of, pre, modern, politics, historian, michael, doyle, who, undertook, an, extensive, research, on, empires, extended, the, observation, into, the, modern, era, empires, have, been, the, key, actors, in, world, politics, for, millennia, they, helped, create, the, interdependent, civilizations, of, all, the, continents, imperial, control, stretches, through, history, many, say, to, the, present, day, empires, are, as, old, as, history, itself, they, have, held, the, leading, role, ever, since, the, author, of, the, idea, of, nationalism, a, study, in, its, origins, and, background, hans, kohn, acknowledged, that, it, was, the, opposite, idea, of, imperialism, that, was, perhaps, the, most, influential, single, idea, for, two, millennia, the, ordering, of, human, society, through, unified, dominion, and, common, civilization, yet, a, century, ago, most, of, the, world, was, ruled, by, persons, who, proudly, proclaimed, themselves, emperors, and, were, proud, of, their, empires, of, the, great, powers, only, the, united, states, and, france, were, republics, expert, on, warfare, quincy, wright, generalized, on, what, he, called, universal, empire, empire, unifying, all, the, contemporary, system, balance, of, power, systems, have, in, the, past, tended, through, the, process, of, conquest, of, lesser, states, by, greater, states, towards, reduction, in, the, number, of, states, involved, and, towards, less, frequent, but, more, devastating, wars, until, eventually, a, universal, empire, has, been, established, through, the, conquest, by, one, of, all, those, remaining, german, sociologist, friedrich, tenbruck, finds, that, the, macro, historic, process, of, imperial, expansion, gave, rise, to, global, history, in, which, the, formations, of, universal, empires, were, most, significant, stages, a, later, group, of, political, scientists, working, on, the, phenomenon, of, the, current, unipolarity, in, 2007, edited, research, on, several, pre, modern, civilizations, by, experts, in, respective, fields, the, overall, conclusion, was, that, the, balance, of, power, was, inherently, unstable, order, and, usually, soon, broke, in, favor, of, imperial, order, yet, before, the, advent, of, the, unipolarity, world, historian, arnold, toynbee, and, political, scientist, martin, wight, had, drawn, the, same, conclusion, with, an, unambiguous, implication, for, the, modern, world, when, this, pattern, of, political, history, is, found, in, the, new, world, as, well, as, in, the, old, world, it, looks, as, if, the, pattern, must, be, intrinsic, to, the, political, history, of, societies, of, the, species, we, call, civilizations, in, whatever, part, of, the, world, the, specimens, of, this, species, occur, if, this, conclusion, is, warranted, it, illuminates, our, understanding, of, civilization, itself, most, states, systems, have, ended, in, universal, empire, which, has, swallowed, all, the, states, of, the, system, the, examples, are, so, abundant, that, we, must, ask, two, questions, is, there, any, states, system, which, has, not, led, fairly, directly, to, the, establishment, of, a, world, empire, does, the, evidence, rather, suggest, that, we, should, expect, any, states, system, to, culminate, in, this, way, it, might, be, argued, that, every, state, system, can, only, maintain, its, existence, on, the, balance, of, power, that, the, latter, is, inherently, unstable, and, that, sooner, or, later, its, tensions, and, conflicts, will, be, resolved, into, a, monopoly, of, power, the, earliest, thinker, to, approach, the, phenomenon, of, universal, empire, from, a, theoretical, point, of, view, was, polybius, 2, 3, in, previous, times, events, in, the, world, occurred, without, impinging, on, one, another, history, became, a, whole, as, if, a, single, body, events, in, italy, and, libya, came, to, be, enmeshed, with, those, in, asia, and, greece, and, everything, gets, directed, towards, one, single, goal, johann, gottlieb, fichte, having, witnessed, the, battle, at, jena, in, 1806, when, napoleon, overwhelmed, prussia, described, what, he, perceived, as, a, deep, historical, trend, there, is, necessary, tendency, in, every, cultivated, state, to, extend, itself, generally, such, is, the, case, in, ancient, history, as, the, states, become, stronger, in, themselves, and, cast, off, that, foreign, power, the, tendency, towards, a, universal, monarchy, over, the, whole, christian, world, necessarily, comes, to, light, this, tendency, has, shown, itself, successively, in, several, states, which, could, make, pretensions, to, such, a, dominion, and, since, the, fall, of, the, papacy, it, has, become, the, sole, animating, principle, of, our, history, whether, clearly, or, not, it, may, be, obscurely, yet, has, this, tendency, lain, at, the, root, of, the, undertakings, of, many, states, in, modern, times, although, no, individual, epoch, may, have, contemplated, this, purpose, yet, is, this, the, spirit, which, runs, through, all, these, individual, epochs, and, invisibly, urges, them, onward, fichte, s, later, compatriot, geographer, alexander, von, humboldt, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, observed, a, macro, historic, trend, of, imperial, growth, in, both, hemispheres, men, of, great, and, strong, minds, as, well, as, whole, nations, acted, under, influence, of, one, idea, the, purity, of, which, was, utterly, unknown, to, them, the, imperial, expansion, filled, the, world, c, 1900, two, famous, contemporary, observers, frederick, turner, and, halford, mackinder, described, the, event, and, drew, implications, the, former, predicting, american, overseas, expansion, and, the, latter, stressing, that, the, world, empire, is, now, in, sight, in, 1870, argentine, diplomat, jurist, and, political, theorist, juan, bautista, alberdi, described, imperial, consolidation, as, von, humboldt, he, found, this, trend, unplanned, and, irrational, but, evident, beyond, doubt, in, the, unwritten, history, of, events, he, linked, this, trend, to, the, recent, evolution, theory, nations, gravitate, towards, the, formation, of, a, single, universal, society, the, laws, that, lead, the, nations, in, that, direction, are, the, same, natural, laws, that, has, formed, societies, and, are, part, of, evolution, these, evolutionary, laws, exist, disregarding, whether, men, recognize, them, similarly, friedrich, ratzel, observed, that, the, drive, toward, the, building, of, continually, larger, states, continues, throughout, the, entirety, of, history, and, is, active, in, the, present, he, drew, seven, laws, of, expansionism, his, seventh, law, stated, the, general, trend, toward, amalgamation, transmits, the, tendency, of, territorial, growth, from, state, to, state, and, increases, the, tendency, in, the, process, of, transmission, he, commented, on, this, law, to, make, its, meaning, clear, there, is, on, this, small, planet, sufficient, space, for, only, one, great, state, two, other, contemporaries, kang, youwei, and, george, vacher, de, lapouge, stressed, that, imperial, expansion, cannot, indefinitely, proceed, on, the, definite, surface, of, the, globe, and, therefore, world, empire, is, imminent, kang, youwei, in, 1885, believed, that, the, imperial, trend, will, culminate, in, the, contest, between, washington, and, berlin, and, vacher, de, lapouge, in, 1899, estimated, that, the, final, contest, will, be, between, russia, and, america, in, which, america, is, likely, to, triumph, the, above, envisaged, contests, indeed, took, place, known, to, us, as, world, war, i, and, ii, writing, during, the, first, oswald, spengler,

of, intellectual, self, disarmament, the, chinese, states, defended, their, last, independence, with, bitterness, but, in, vain, also, in, vain, rome, attempted, to, avoid, conquest, of, the, hellenistic, east, imperialism, is, so, necessary, a, product, of, any, civilization, that, when, a, strongest, people, refuse, to, assume, the, role, of, master, it, is, pushed, into, it, it, is, the, same, with, us, the, hague, conference, of, 1907, was, the, prelude, of, world, war, the, washington, conference, of, 1921, will, have, been, that, of, other, wars, napoleon, introduced, the, idea, of, military, world, empire, different, from, the, preceding, european, maritime, empires, the, contest, for, the, heritage, of, the, whole, world, will, culminate, within, two, generations, from, 1922, the, destinies, of, small, states, are, without, importance, to, the, great, march, of, things, the, strongest, race, will, win, and, seize, the, management, of, the, world, writing, during, the, next, world, war, political, scientists, derwent, whittlesey, robert, strausz, hup, and, john, h, herz, concluded, now, that, the, earth, is, at, last, parceled, out, consolidation, has, commenced, in, this, world, of, fighting, superstates, there, could, be, no, end, to, war, until, one, state, had, subjected, all, others, until, world, empire, had, been, achieved, by, the, strongest, this, undoubtedly, is, the, logical, final, stage, in, the, geopolitical, theory, of, evolution, the, world, is, no, longer, large, enough, to, harbor, several, self, contained, powers, the, trend, toward, world, domination, or, hegemony, of, a, single, power, is, but, the, ultimate, consummation, of, a, power, system, engrafted, upon, an, otherwise, integrated, world, writing, in,

it, has, come, to, an, end, more, likely, the, greatest, convergence, of, all, time, is, at, hand, possibly, this, is, the, deeper, meaning, of, the, savage, world, conflicts, of, the, 20th, century, he, old, european, tendency, toward, division, is, now, being, thrust, aside, by, the, new, global, trend, toward, unification, and, the, onrush, of, this, trend, may, not, come, to, rest, until, it,

verge, of, a, period, of, empire, building, which, is, the, last, phase, of, the, struggle, for, the, conquest, of, the, world, as, an, elimination, contest, one, of, the, three, remaining, powers, or, a, combination, will, achieve, by, force, that, unified, control, made, mandatory, by, the, times, we, live, in, anyone, of, three, by, defeating, the, other, two, would, conquer, and, rule, the, world, if, we, fail, to, institute, a, unified, control, over, the, world, in, democratic, way, the, iron, law, of, history, would, compel, us, to, wage, wars, until, world, empire, is, finally, attained, through, conquest, since, the, former, way, is, improbable, due, human, blindness, we, should, precipitate, the, unification, by, conquest, as, quickly, as, possible, and, start, the, restoration, of, human, liberties, within, the, world, empire, reves, added, postscript, to, the, anatomy, opening, a, few, weeks, after, the, publication, of, this, book, the, first, atomic, bomb, exploded, over, the, city, of, hiroshima, this, new, physical, fact, however, has, changed, nothing, in, the, political, situation, the, world, empire, remains, inevitable, and, nothing, else, in, the, book, would, have, been, said, differently, had, it, been, written, after, august, 6, 1945, not, much, chance, we, have, to, establish, world, government, before, the, next, horrible, war, between, the, two, superpowers, and, whoever, is, victorious, would, establish, the, world, empire, the, book, sold, an, exceptional, 800, 000, copies, in, thirty, languages, was, endorsed, by, albert, einstein, and, numerous, other, prominent, figures, and, in, 1950, reves, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, peace, prize, the, year, after, the, war, and, in, the, first, year, of, the, nuclear, age, einstein, and, british, philosopher, bertrand, russell, known, as, prominent, pacifists, outlined, for, the, near, future, a, perspective, of, world, empire, world, government, established, by, force, einstein, believed, that, unless, world, government, is, established, by, agreement, an, imperial, world, government, would, come, by, war, or, wars, russell, expected, a,

through, the, preponderant, power, of, either, america, or, russia, whichever, proved, herself, victorious, in, the, final, struggle, russian, colleague, of, russell, and, niebuhr, georgy, fedotov, wrote, in, 1945, all, empires, are, but, stages, on, the, way, to, the, sole, empire, which, must, swallow, all, others, the, only, question, is, who, will, build, it, and, on, which, foundations, universal, unity, is, the, only, alternative, to, annihilation, unity, by, conference, is, utopian, but, unity, by, conquest, by, the, strongest, power, is, not, and, probably, the, uncompleted, in, this, war, will, be, completed, in, the, next, pax, atlantica, is, the, best, of, possible, outcomes, originally, drafted, as, a, secret, study, for, the, office, of, strategic, services, the, precursor, of, the, cia, in, 1944, and, published, as, a, book, three, years, later, the, struggle, for, the, world, by, james, burnham, concludes, if, either, of, the, two, superpowers, wins, the, result, would, be, a, universal, empire, which, in, our, case, would, also, be, a, world, empire, the, historical, stage, for, a, world, empire, had, already, been, set, prior, to, and, independently, of, the, discovery, of, atomic, weapons, but, these, weapons, make, a, world, empire, inevitable, and, imminent, the, atomic, weapons, will, not, permit, the, world, to, wait, only, a, world, empire, can, establish, monopoly, on, atomic, weapons, and, thus, guarantee, the, survival, of, civilization, a, world, empire, is, in, fact, the, objective, of, the, third, world, war, which, in, its, preliminary, stages, has, already, began, the, issue, of, a, world, empire, will, be, decided, and, in, our, day, in, the, course, of, the, decision, both, of, the, present, antagonists, may, it, is, true, be, destroyed, but, one, of, them, must, be, the, next, year, world, historian, crane, brinton, similarly, supposed, that, the, bomb, may, in, the, hands, of, a, very, skillful, and, lucky, nation, prove, to, be, the, weapon, that, permits, that, nation, to, unify, the, world, by, imperial, conquest, to, do, what, napoleon, and, hitler, failed, to, do, combined, with, other, wonders, of, science, it, would, permit, a, quick, and, easy, conquest, of, the, world, in, 1951, hans, morgenthau, concluded, that, the, best, outcome, of, world, war, iii, would, be, world, empire, today, war, has, become, an, instrument, of, universal, destruction, an, instrument, that, destroys, the, victor, and, the, vanquished, at, worst, victor, and, loser, would, be, undistinguishable, under, the, leveling, impact, of, such, a, catastrophe, at, best, the, destruction, on, one, side, would, not, be, quite, as, great, as, on, the, other, the, victor, would, be, somewhat, better, off, than, the, loser, and, would, establish, with, the, aid, of, modern, technology, his, domination, over, the, world, expert, on, earlier, civilizations, toynbee, further, developed, the, subject, of, world, war, iii, leading, to, world, empire, the, outcome, of, the, third, world, war, seemed, likely, to, be, the, imposition, of, an, ecumenical, peace, of, the, roman, kind, by, the, victor, whose, victory, would, leave, him, with, a, monopoly, on, the, control, of, atomic, energy, in, his, grasp, this, denouement, was, foreshadowed, not, only, by, present, facts, but, by, historical, precedents, since, in, the, histories, of, other, civilizations, the, time, of, troubles, had, been, apt, to, culminate, in, the, delivery, of, a, knock, out, blow, resulting, in, the, establishment, of, a, universal,

comparing, eight, civilizations, they, conclude, the, rigidity, of, the, borders, contributed, importantly, to, hegemony, in, every, concerned, case, hence, when, the, system, s, borders, are, rigid, the, probability, of, hegemony, is, high, the, circumscription, theory, was, stressed, in, the, comparative, studies, of, the, roman, and, chinese, empires, the, circumscribed, chinese, empire, recovered, from, all, falls, while, the, fall, of, rome, by, contrast, was, fatal, what, counteracted, this, tendency, in, europe, was, a, countervailing, tendency, for, the, geographical, boundaries, of, the, system, to, expand, if, europe, had, been, a, closed, system, some, great, power, would, eventually, have, succeeded, in, establishing, absolute, supremacy, over, the, other, states, in, the, region, the, ancient, chinese, system, was, relatively, enclosed, whereas, the, european, system, began, to, expand, its, reach, to, the, rest, of, the, world, from, the, onset, of, system, formation, in, addition, overseas, provided, outlet, for, territorial, competition, thereby, allowing, international, competition, on, the, european, continent, to, trump, the, ongoing, pressure, toward, convergence, in, the, 1945, book, the, precarious, balance, on, four, centuries, of, the, european, power, struggle, ludwig, dehio, explained, the, durability, of, the, european, states, system, by, its, overseas, expansion, overseas, expansion, and, the, system, of, states, were, born, at, the, same, time, the, vitality, that, burst, the, bounds, of, the, western, world, also, destroyed, its, unity, in, a, more, famous, 1945, book, reves, similarly, argued, that, the, era, of, outward, expansion, is, forever, closed, and, the, historic, trend, of, expansion, will, result, in, direct, collision, between, the, remaining, powers, edward, carr, causally, linked, the, end, of, the, overseas, outlet, for, imperial, expansion, and, world, wars, in, the, nineteenth, century, he, wrote, during, the, second, world, war, imperialist, wars, were, waged, against, primitive, peoples, it, was, silly, for, european, countries, to, fight, against, one, another, when, they, could, still, maintain, social, cohesion, by, continuous, expansion, in, asia, and, africa, since, 1900, however, this, has, no, longer, been, possible, the, situation, has, radically, changed, now, wars, are, between, imperial, powers, hans, morgenthau, wrote, that, the, very, imperial, expansion, into, relatively, empty, geographical, spaces, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, in, africa, eurasia, and, western, north, america, deflected, great, power, politics, into, the, periphery, of, the, earth, thereby, reducing, conflict, for, example, the, more, attention, russia, france, and, the, united, states, paid, to, expanding, into, far, flung, territories, in, imperial, fashion, the, less, attention, they, paid, to, one, another, and, the, more, peaceful, in, a, sense, the, world, was, but, by, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, consolidation, of, the, great, nation, states, and, empires, of, the, west, was, consummated, and, territorial, gains, could, only, be, made, at, the, expense, of, one, another, john, h, herz, outlined, one, chief, function, of, the, overseas, expansion, and, the, impact, of, its, end, european, balance, of, power, could, be, maintained, or, adjusted, because, it, was, relatively, easy, to, divert, european, conflicts, into, overseas, directions, and, adjust, them, there, thus, the, openness, of, the, world, contributed, to, the, consolidation, of, the, territorial, system, the, end, of, the, world, frontier, and, the, resulting, closedness, of, an, interdependent, world, inevitably, affected, the, system, s, effectiveness, some, later, commentators, drew, similar, conclusions, for, some, commentators, the, passing, of, the, nineteenth, century, seemed, destined, to, mark, the, end, of, this, long, era, of, european, empire, building, the, unexplored, and, unclaimed, blank, spaces, on, the, world, map, were, rapidly, diminishing, and, the, sense, of, global, closure, prompted, an, anxious, fin, de, si, cle, debate, about, the, future, of, the, great, empires, the, closure, of, the, global, imperial, system, implied, the, beginning, of, a, new, era, of, intensifying, inter, imperial, struggle, along, borders, that, now, straddled, the, globe, the, opportunity, for, any, system, to, expand, in, size, seems, almost, a, necessary, condition, for, it, to, remain, balanced, at, least, over, the, long, haul, far, from, being, impossible, or, exceedingly, improbable, systemic, hegemony, is, likely, under, two, conditions, when, the, boundaries, of, the, international, system, remain, stable, and, no, new, major, powers, emerge, from, outside, the, system, with, the, system, becoming, global, further, expansion, is, precluded, the, geopolitical, condition, of, global, closure, will, remain, to, the, end, of, history, since, the, contemporary, international, system, is, global, we, can, rule, out, the, possibility, that, geographic, expansion, of, the, system, will, contribute, to, the, emergence, of, a, new, balance, of, power, as, it, did, so, many, times, in, the, past, as, quincy, wright, had, put, it, this, process, can, no, longer, continue, without, interplanetary, wars, one, of, leading, experts, on, world, system, theory, christopher, chase, dunn, noted, that, the, circumscription, theory, is, applicable, for, the, global, system, since, the, global, system, is, circumscribed, in, fact, within, less, than, a, century, of, its, circumscribed, existence, the, global, system, overcame, the, centuries, old, balance, of, power, and, reached, the, unipolarity, given, constant, spatial, parameters, of, the, global, system, its, unipolar, structure, is, neither, historically, unusual, nor, theoretically, surprising, randall, schweller, theorized, that, a, closed, international, system, such, as, the, global, became, a, century, ago, would, reach, entropy, in, a, kind, of, thermodynamic, law, once, the, state, of, entropy, is, reached, there, is, no, going, back, the, initial, conditions, are, lost, forever, stressing, the, curiosity, of, the, fact, schweller, writes, that, since, the, moment, the, modern, world, became, a, closed, system, the, process, has, worked, in, only, one, direction, from, many, poles, to, two, poles, to, one, pole, thus, unipolarity, might, represent, the, entropy, stable, and, permanent, loss, of, variation, in, the, global, system, chalmers, johnson, argues, that, the, us, global, network, of, hundreds, of, military, bases, already, represents, a, global, empire, in, its, initial, form, for, a, major, power, prosecution, of, any, war, that, is, not, a, defense, of, the, homeland, usually, requires, overseas, military, bases, for, strategic, reasons, after, the, war, is, over, it, is, tempting, for, the, victor, to, retain, such, bases, and, easy, to, find, reasons, to, do, so, commonly, preparedness, for, a, possible, resumption, of, hostilities, will, be, invoked, over, time, if, a, nation, s, aims, become, imperial, the, bases, form, the, skeleton, of, an, empire, simon, dalby, associates, the, network, of, bases, with, the, roman, imperial, system, looking, at, these, impressive, facilities, which, reproduce, substantial, parts, of, american, suburbia, complete, with, movie, theatres, and, restaurant, chains, the, parallels, with, roman, garrison, towns, built, on, the, rhine, or, on, hadrian, s, wall, in, england, where, the, remains, are, strikingly, visible, on, the, landscape, are, obvious, less, visible, is, the, sheer, scale, of, the, logistics, to, keep, garrison, troops, in, residence, in, the, far, flung, reaches, of, empire, that, presence, literally, builds, the, cultural, logic, of, the, garrison, troops, into, the, landscape, a, permanent, reminder, of, imperial, control, kenneth, pomeranz, and, harvard, historian, niall, ferguson, share, the, above, cited, views, with, american, military, bases, in, over, 120, countries, we, have, hardly, seen, the, end, of,

historian, charles, s, maier, opens, his, among, empires, american, ascendancy, and, its, predecessors, with, these, words, what, a, substratum, for, empire, compared, with, which, the, foundation, of, the, macedonian, the, roman, and, the, british, sink, into, insignificance, one, of, the, most, accepted, distinctions, between, earlier, empires, and, the, american, empire, is, the, latter, s, global, or, planetary, scope, french, former, foreign, minister, hubert, vedrine, wondered, the, situation, is, unprecedented, what, previous, empire, subjugated, the, entire, world, the, quests, for, universal, empire, are, old, but, the, present, quest, outdoes, the, previous, in, the, notable, respect, of, being, the, first, to, actually, be, global, in, its, reach, another, historian, paul, kennedy, who, wrote, prediction, talks, of, the, imminent, us, imperial, overstretch, in, 2002, acknowledged, about, the, present, world, system, nothing, has, ever, existed, like, this, disparity, of, power, the, pax, britannica, was, run, on, the, cheap, napoleon, s, france, and, philip, ii, s, spain, had, powerful, foes, and, were, part, of, a, multipolar, system, charlemagne, s, empire, was, merely, western, european, in, stretch, the, roman, empire, stretched, further, afield, but, there, was, another, great, empire, in, persia, and, a, larger, one, in, china, there, is, no, comparison, walter, russell, mead, observes, that, the, united, states, attempts, to, recreate, globally, what, the, ancient, empires, of, egypt, china, and, rome, had, each, accomplished, on, a, regional, basis, professor, emeritus, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, leeds, zygmunt, bauman, concludes, that, due, to, its, planetary, dimension, the, new, empire, cannot, be, drawn, on, a, map, the, new, empire, is, not, an, entity, that, could, be, drawn, on, a, map, drawing, a, map, of, the, empire, would, also, be, a, pointless, exercise, because, the, most, conspicuously, imperial, trait, of, the, new, empire, s, mode, of, being, consists, in, viewing, and, treating, the, whole, of, the, planet, as, a, potential, grazing, ground, times, atlas, of, empires, numbers, 70, empires, in, the, world, history, niall, ferguson, lists, numerous, parallels, between, them, and, the, united, states, he, concludes, to, those, who, would, still, insist, on, american, exceptionalism, the, historian, of, empires, can, only, retort, as, exceptional, as, all, the, other, 69, empires, fareed, zakaria, stressed, one, element, not, exceptional, for, the, american, empire, the, concept, of, exceptionalism, all, dominant, empires, thought, they, were, special, in, 1945, historian, ludwig, dehio, predicted, global, unification, due, to, the, circumscription, of, the, global, system, although, he, did, not, use, this, term, being, global, the, system, can, neither, expand, nor, be, subject, to, external, intrusion, as, the, european, states, system, had, been, for, centuries, in, all, previous, struggles, for, supremacy, attempts, to, unite, the, european, peninsula, in, a, single, state, have, been, condemned, to, failure, primarily, through, the, intrusion, of, new, forces, from, outside, the, old, occident, the, occident, was, an, open, area, but, the, globe, was, not, and, for, that, very, reason, ultimately, destined, to, be, unified, and, this, very, process, was, clearly, reflected, in, both, world, wars, fifteen, years, later, dehio, confirmed, his, hypothesis, the, european, system, owed, its, durability, to, its, overseas, outlet, but, how, can, a, multiple, grouping, of, world, states, conceivably, be, supported, from, outside, in, the, framework, of, a, finite, globe, during, the, same, time, quincy, wright, developed, a, similar, concept, balance, of, power, politics, has, aimed, less, at, preserving, peace, than, at, preserving, the, independence, of, states, and, preventing, the, development, of, world, empire, in, the, course, of, history, the, balance, of, power, repeatedly, re, emerged, but, on, ever, wider, scale, eventually, the, scale, became, global, unless, we, proceed, to, interplanetary, wars, this, pattern, can, no, longer, continue, in, spite, of, significant, reversals, the, trend, towards, world, unity, can, scarcely, be, denied, world, unity, appears, to, be, the, limit, toward, which, the, process, of, world, history, seems, to, tend, the, same, interplanetary, motif, is, present, also, in, the, anatomy, of, peace, the, era, of, outward, expansion, is, forever, closed, until, and, unless, we, are, able, to, communicate, with, another, planet, the, theater, of, human, history, will, be, limited, to, geographically, determined, constant, and, known, dimensions, the, historic, trend, of, expansion, will, result, in, direct, collision, between, the, remaining, powers, multiplied, by, modern, technology, the, centripetal, forces, will, accomplish, what, the, greatest, empires, of, the, past,

and, cultural, relativism, outlined, the, inexorable, laws, of, history, by, which, political, units, grow, larger, in, size, and, smaller, in, number, the, process, began, in, the, earliest, times, and, has, continued, almost, always, in, the, same, direction, in, the, long, run, the, tendency, to, unification, has, been, more, powerful, than, of, disintegration, thus, the, history, of, mankind, shows, us, the, grand, spectacle, of, the, grouping, of, man, in, units, of, ever, increasing, size, the, progress, in, the, direction, of, unification, has, been, so, regular, and, so, marked, that, we, must, needs, conclude, that, the, same, tendencies, will, govern, our, history, in, the, future, today, the, unity, of, the, world, is, not, less, conceivable, than, the, modern, nations, were,

logic, they, will, try, to, find, an, escape, but, they, will, try, in, vain, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, crushing, superiority, of, american, plane, production, will, be, an, established, fact, the, solution, of, the, problem, is, by, no, means, ideal, nor, even, satisfactory, but, it, is, the, minor, evil, coudenhove, kalergi, envisaged, a, kind, of, pax, americana, modeled, on, pax,

teleological, theory, of, world, state, toynbee, specified, two, ways, one, is, by, wars, going, on, to, a, bitter, end, at, which, one, surviving, great, power, knocks, out, its, last, remaining,

empire, by, a, universal, conquest, toynbee, emphasized, that, the, world, is, ripe, for, conquest, hitler, s, eventual, failure, to, impose, peace, on, the, world, by, the, force, of, arms, was, due, not, to, any, flaw, in, his, thesis, that, the, world, was, ripe, for, conquest, but, to, an, accidental, combination, of, incidental, errors, in, his, measures, but, in, falling, by, so, narrow, a, margin, to, win, the, prize, of, world, dominion, for, himself, hitler, had, left, the, prize, dangling, within, the, reach, of, any, successor, capable, of, pursuing, the, same, aims, of, world,
