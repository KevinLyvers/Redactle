motivation, is, an, internal, state, that, propels, individuals, to, engage, in, goal, directed, behavior, it, is, often, understood, as, a, force, that, explains, why, people, or, animals, initiate, continue, or, terminate, a, certain, behavior, at, a, particular, time, it, is, a, complex, phenomenon, and, its, precise, definition, is, disputed, it, contrasts, with, amotivation, which, is, a, state, of, apathy, or, listlessness, motivation, is, studied, in, fields, like, psychology, neuroscience, motivation, science, and, philosophy, motivational, states, are, characterized, by, their, direction, intensity, and, persistence, the, direction, of, a, motivational, state, is, shaped, by, the, goal, it, aims, to, achieve, intensity, is, the, strength, of, the, state, and, affects, whether, the, state, is, translated, into, action, and, how, much, effort, is, employed, persistence, refers, to, how, long, an, individual, is, willing, to, engage, in, an, activity, motivation, is, often, divided, into, two, phases, in, the, first, phase, the, individual, establishes, a, goal, while, in, the, second, phase, they, attempt, to, reach, this, goal, many, types, of, motivation, are, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, intrinsic, motivation, comes, from, internal, factors, like, enjoyment, and, curiosity, it, contrasts, with, extrinsic, motivation, which, is, driven, by, external, factors, like, obtaining, rewards, and, avoiding, punishment, for, conscious, motivation, the, individual, is, aware, of, the, motive, driving, the, behavior, which, is, not, the, case, for, unconscious, motivation, other, types, include, rational, and, irrational, motivation, biological, and, cognitive, motivation, short, term, and, long, term, motivation, and, egoistic, and, altruistic, motivation, theories, of, motivation, are, conceptual, frameworks, that, seek, to, explain, motivational, phenomena, content, theories, aim, to, describe, which, internal, factors, motivate, people, and, which, goals, they, commonly, follow, examples, are, the, hierarchy, of, needs, the, two, factor, theory, and, the, learned, needs, theory, they, contrast, with, process, theories, which, discuss, the, cognitive, emotional, and, decision, making, processes, that, underlie, human, motivation, like, expectancy, theory, equity, theory, goal, setting, theory, self, determination, theory, and, reinforcement, theory, motivation, is, relevant, to, many, fields, it, affects, educational, success, work, performance, athletic, success, and, economic, behavior, it, is, further, pertinent, in, the, fields, of, personal, development, health, and, criminal, law, motivation, is, often, understood, as, an, internal, state, or, force, that, propels, individuals, to, engage, and, persist, in, goal, directed, behavior, motivational, states, explain, why, people, or, animals, initiate, continue, or, terminate, a, certain, behavior, at, a, particular, time, motivational, states, are, characterized, by, the, goal, they, aim, for, as, well, as, the, intensity, and, duration, of, the, effort, devoted, to, the, goal, motivational, states, have, different, degrees, of, strength, if, a, state, has, a, high, degree, then, it, is, more, likely, to, influence, behavior, than, if, it, has, a, low, degree, motivation, contrasts, with, amotivation, which, is, a, lack, of, interest, in, a, certain, activity, or, a, resistance, to, it, in, a, slightly, different, sense, the, word, motivation, can, also, refer, to, the, act, of, motivating, someone, and, to, a, reason, or, goal, for, doing, something, it, comes, from, the, latin, term, movere, to, move, the, traditional, discipline, studying, motivation, is, psychology, it, investigates, how, motivation, arises, which, factors, influence, it, and, what, effects, it, has, motivation, science, is, a, more, recent, field, of, inquiry, focused, on, an, integrative, approach, that, tries, to, link, insights, from, different, subdisciplines, neurology, is, interested, in, the, underlying, neurological, mechanisms, such, as, the, involved, brain, areas, and, neurotransmitters, philosophy, aims, to, clarify, the, nature, of, motivation, and, understand, its, relation, to, other, concepts, motivation, is, not, directly, observable, but, has, to, be, inferred, from, other, characteristics, there, are, different, ways, to, do, so, and, measure, it, the, most, common, approach, is, to, rely, on, self, reports, and, use, questionnaires, they, can, include, direct, questions, like, how, motivated, are, you, but, may, also, inquire, about, additional, factors, in, relation, to, the, goals, feelings, and, effort, invested, in, a, particular, activity, another, approach, is, based, on, external, observation, of, the, individual, this, can, concern, studying, behavioral, changes, but, may, also, include, additional, methods, like, measuring, brain, activity, and, skin, conductance, many, academic, definitions, of, motivation, have, been, proposed, but, there, is, little, consensus, on, its, precise, characterization, this, is, partly, because, motivation, is, a, complex, phenomenon, with, many, aspects, and, different, definitions, often, focus, on, different, aspects, some, definitions, emphasize, internal, factors, this, can, involve, psychological, aspects, in, relation, to, desires, and, volitions, or, physiological, aspects, regarding, physical, needs, for, example, john, dewey, and, abraham, maslow, use, a, psychological, perspective, to, understand, motivation, as, a, form, of, desire, while, jackson, beatty, and, charles, ransom, gallistel, see, it, as, a, physical, process, akin, to, hunger, and, thirst, some, definitions, stress, the, continuity, between, human, and, animal, motivation, but, others, draw, a, clear, distinction, between, the, two, this, is, often, emphasized, by, the, idea, that, human, agents, act, for, reasons, and, are, not, mechanistically, driven, to, follow, their, strongest, impulse, a, closely, related, disagreement, concerns, the, role, of, awareness, and, rationality, definitions, emphasizing, this, aspect, understand, motivation, as, a, mostly, conscious, process, of, rationally, considering, the, most, appropriate, behavior, another, perspective, emphasizes, the, multitude, of, unconscious, and, subconscious, factors, responsible, other, definitions, characterize, motivation, as, a, form, of, arousal, that, provides, energy, to, direct, and, maintain, behavior, for, instance, k, b, madsen, sees, motivation, as, the, driving, force, behind, behavior, while, elliott, s, vatenstein, and, roderick, wong, emphasize, that, motivation, leads, to, goal, oriented, behavior, that, is, interested, in, consequences, the, role, of, goals, in, motivation, is, sometimes, paired, with, the, claim, that, it, leads, to, flexible, behavior, in, contrast, to, blind, reflexes, or, fixed, stimulus, response, patterns, this, is, based, on, the, idea, that, individuals, use, means, to, bring, about, the, goal, and, are, flexible, in, regard, to, what, means, they, employ, according, to, this, view, the, feeding, behavior, of, rats, is, based, on, motivation, since, they, can, learn, to, traverse, through, complicated, mazes, to, satisfy, their, hunger, which, is, not, the, case, for, the, stimulus, bound, feeding, behavior, of, flies, some, psychologists, define, motivation, as, a, temporary, and, reversible, process, for, example, robert, a, hinde, and, john, alcock, see, it, as, a, transitory, state, that, affects, responsiveness, to, stimuli, this, approach, makes, it, possible, to, contrast, motivation, with, phenomena, like, learning, which, bring, about, permanent, behavioral, changes, another, approach, is, to, provide, a, very, broad, characterization, to, cover, many, different, aspects, of, motivation, this, often, results, in, very, long, definitions, by, including, many, of, the, factors, listed, above, the, multitude, of, definitions, and, the, lack, of, consensus, have, prompted, some, theorists, like, psychologists, b, n, bunnell, and, donald, a, dewsbury, to, doubt, that, the, concept, of, motivation, is, theoretically, useful, and, to, see, it, instead, as, a, mere, hypothetical, construct, the, term, motivation, is, closely, related, to, the, term, motive, and, the, two, terms, are, often, used, as, synonyms, however, some, theorists, distinguish, their, precise, meanings, as, technical, terms, for, example, psychologist, andrea, fuchs, understands, motivation, as, the, sum, of, separate, motives, according, to, psychologist, ruth, kanfer, motives, are, stable, dispositional, tendencies, that, contrast, with, the, dynamic, nature, of, motivation, as, a, fluctuating, internal, state, motivation, is, closely, related, to, ability, effort, and, action, an, ability, is, a, power, to, perform, an, action, like, the, ability, to, walk, or, to, write, individuals, can, have, abilities, without, exercising, them, they, are, more, likely, to, be, motivated, to, do, something, if, they, have, the, ability, to, do, it, but, having, an, ability, is, not, a, requirement, and, it, is, possible, to, be, motivated, while, lacking, the, corresponding, ability, effort, is, the, physical, and, mental, energy, invested, when, exercising, an, ability, it, depends, on, motivation, and, high, motivation, is, associated, with, high, effort, the, quality, of, the, resulting, performance, depends, on, the, ability, effort, and, motivation, motivation, to, perform, an, action, can, be, present, even, if, the, action, is, not, executed, this, is, the, case, for, instance, if, there, is, a, stronger, motivation, to, engage, in, a, different, action, at, the, same, time, motivation, is, a, complex, phenomenon, that, is, often, analyzed, in, terms, of, different, components, and, stages, components, are, aspects, that, different, motivational, states, have, in, common, often, discussed, components, are, direction, intensity, and, persistence, stages, or, phases, are, temporal, parts, of, how, motivation, unfolds, over, time, like, the, initial, goal, setting, stage, in, contrast, to, the, following, goal, striving, stage, a, closely, related, issue, concerns, the, different, types, of, mental, phenomena, that, are, responsible, for, motivation, like, desires, beliefs, and, rational, deliberation, some, theorists, hold, that, a, desire, to, do, something, is, an, essential, part, of, all, motivational, states, this, view, is, based, on, the, idea, that, the, desire, to, do, something, justifies, the, effort, to, engage, in, this, activity, however, this, view, is, not, generally, accepted, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, at, least, in, some, cases, actions, are, motivated, by, other, mental, phenomena, like, beliefs, or, rational, deliberation, for, example, a, person, may, be, motivated, to, undergo, a, painful, root, canal, treatment, because, they, conclude, that, it, is, a, necessary, thing, to, do, even, though, they, do, not, actively, desire, it, motivation, is, sometimes, discussed, in, terms, of, three, main, components, direction, intensity, and, persistence, direction, refers, to, the, goal, people, choose, it, is, the, objective, in, which, they, decide, to, invest, their, energy, for, example, if, one, roommate, decides, to, go, to, the, movies, while, the, other, visits, a, party, they, both, have, motivation, but, their, motivational, states, differ, in, regard, to, the, direction, they, pursue, the, pursued, objective, often, forms, part, of, a, hierarchy, of, means, end, relationships, this, implies, that, several, steps, or, lower, level, goals, may, have, to, be, fulfilled, to, reach, a, higher, level, goal, for, example, to, achieve, the, higher, level, goal, of, writing, a, complete, article, one, needs, to, realize, different, lower, level, goals, like, writing, different, sections, of, the, article, some, goals, are, specific, like, reducing, one, s, weight, by, 3, kg, while, others, are, non, specific, like, losing, as, much, weight, as, possible, specific, goals, often, affect, motivation, and, performance, positively, by, making, it, easier, to, plan, and, track, progress, the, goal, belongs, to, the, individual, s, motivational, reason, and, explains, why, they, favor, an, action, and, engage, in, it, motivational, reasons, contrast, with, normative, reasons, which, are, facts, that, determine, what, should, be, done, or, why, a, course, of, action, is, objectively, good, motivational, reasons, can, be, in, tune, with, normative, reasons, but, this, is, not, always, the, case, for, example, if, a, cake, is, poisoned, then, this, is, a, normative, reason, for, the, host, not, to, offer, it, to, their, guests, but, if, they, are, not, aware, of, the, poison, then, politeness, may, be, their, motivating, reason, to, offer, it, the, intensity, of, motivation, corresponds, to, how, much, energy, someone, is, willing, to, invest, into, a, particular, task, for, instance, two, athletes, engaging, in, the, same, drill, have, the, same, direction, but, differ, concerning, the, motivational, intensity, if, one, gives, their, best, while, the, other, only, puts, in, minimal, effort, some, theorists, use, the, term, effort, rather, than, intensity, for, this, component, the, strength, of, a, motivational, state, also, affects, whether, it, is, translated, into, action, one, theory, states, that, different, motivational, states, compete, with, each, other, and, that, only, the, behavior, with, the, highest, net, force, of, motivation, is, put, into, action, however, it, is, controversial, whether, this, is, always, true, for, example, it, has, been, suggested, that, in, cases, of, rational, deliberation, it, may, be, possible, to, act, against, one, s, strongest, motive, another, problem, is, that, this, view, may, lead, to, a, form, of, determinism, that, denies, the, existence, of, free, will, persistence, is, the, long, term, component, of, motivation, and, refers, to, how, long, an, individual, engages, in, an, activity, a, high, level, of, motivational, persistence, manifests, itself, in, a, sustained, dedication, over, time, the, motivational, persistence, in, relation, to, the, chosen, goal, contrasts, with, flexibility, on, the, level, of, the, means, individuals, may, adjust, their, approach, and, try, different, strategies, on, the, level, of, the, means, to, reach, a, pursued, end, this, way, individuals, can, adapt, to, changes, in, the, physical, and, social, environment, that, affect, the, effectiveness, of, previously, chosen, means, the, components, of, motivation, can, be, understood, in, analogy, to, the, allocation, of, limited, resources, direction, intensity, and, persistence, determine, where, to, allocate, energy, how, much, of, it, and, for, how, long, for, effective, action, it, is, usually, relevant, to, have, the, right, form, of, motivation, on, all, three, levels, to, pursue, an, appropriate, goal, with, the, required, intensity, and, persistence, the, process, of, motivation, is, commonly, divided, into, two, stages, goal, setting, and, goal, striving, goal, setting, is, the, phase, in, which, the, direction, of, motivation, is, determined, it, involves, considering, the, reasons, for, and, against, different, courses, of, action, and, then, committing, oneself, to, a, goal, one, aims, to, achieve, the, goal, setting, process, by, itself, does, not, ensure, that, the, plan, is, carried, out, this, happens, in, the, goal, striving, stage, in, which, the, individual, tries, to, implement, the, plan, it, starts, with, the, initiation, of, the, action, and, includes, putting, in, effort, and, trying, different, strategies, to, succeed, various, difficulties, can, arise, in, this, phase, the, individual, has, to, muster, the, initiative, to, get, started, with, the, goal, directed, behavior, and, stay, committed, even, when, faced, with, obstacles, without, giving, in, to, distractions, they, also, need, to, ensure, that, the, chosen, means, are, effective, and, that, they, do, not, overexert, themselves, goal, setting, and, goal, striving, are, usually, understood, as, distinct, stages, but, they, can, be, intertwined, in, various, ways, depending, on, the, performance, during, the, striving, phase, the, individual, may, adjust, their, goal, for, example, if, the, performance, is, worse, than, expected, they, may, lower, their, goals, this, can, go, hand, in, hand, with, adjusting, the, effort, invested, in, the, activity, emotional, states, affect, how, goals, are, set, and, which, goals, are, prioritized, positive, emotions, are, associated, with, optimism, about, the, value, of, a, goal, and, create, a, tendency, to, seek, positive, outcomes, negative, emotions, are, associated, with, a, more, pessimistic, outlook, and, tend, to, lead, to, the, avoidance, of, bad, outcomes, some, theorists, have, suggested, further, phases, for, example, psychologist, barry, j, zimmerman, includes, an, additional, self, reflection, phase, after, the, performance, a, further, approach, is, to, distinguish, two, parts, of, the, planning, the, first, part, consists, in, choosing, a, goal, while, the, second, part, is, about, planning, how, to, realize, this, goal, many, different, types, of, motivation, are, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, they, differ, from, each, other, based, on, the, underlying, mechanisms, responsible, for, their, manifestation, what, goals, are, pursued, what, temporal, horizon, they, encompass, and, who, is, intended, to, benefit, the, distinction, between, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, motivation, is, based, on, the, source, or, origin, of, the, motivation, intrinsic, motivation, comes, from, within, the, individual, and, is, driven, by, internal, factors, like, enjoyment, curiosity, or, a, sense, of, fulfillment, it, occurs, when, people, pursue, an, activity, for, its, own, sake, it, can, be, due, to, affective, factors, when, the, person, engages, in, the, behavior, because, it, feels, good, or, cognitive, factors, when, they, see, it, as, something, good, or, meaningful, an, example, of, intrinsic, motivation, is, a, person, who, plays, basketball, during, lunch, break, only, because, they, enjoy, it, extrinsic, motivation, arises, from, external, factors, such, as, rewards, punishments, or, recognition, from, others, this, occurs, when, people, engage, in, an, activity, because, they, are, interested, in, the, effects, or, the, outcome, of, the, activity, rather, than, in, the, activity, itself, for, instance, if, a, student, does, their, homework, because, they, are, afraid, of, being, punished, by, their, parents, then, extrinsic, motivation, is, responsible, intrinsic, motivation, is, often, more, highly, regarded, than, extrinsic, motivation, it, is, associated, with, genuine, passion, creativity, a, sense, of, purpose, and, personal, autonomy, it, also, tends, to, come, with, stronger, commitment, and, persistence, intrinsic, motivation, is, a, key, factor, in, cognitive, social, and, physical, development, the, degree, of, intrinsic, motivation, is, affected, by, various, conditions, including, a, sense, of, autonomy, and, positive, feedback, from, others, in, the, field, of, education, intrinsic, motivation, tends, to, result, in, high, quality, learning, however, there, are, also, certain, advantages, to, extrinsic, motivation, it, can, provide, people, with, motivation, to, engage, in, useful, or, necessary, tasks, which, they, do, not, naturally, find, interesting, or, enjoyable, some, theorists, understand, the, difference, between, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, motivation, as, a, spectrum, rather, than, a, clear, dichotomy, this, is, linked, to, the, idea, that, the, more, autonomous, an, activity, is, the, more, it, is, associated, with, intrinsic, motivation, a, behavior, can, be, motivated, only, by, intrinsic, motives, only, by, extrinsic, motives, or, by, a, combination, of, both, in, the, latter, case, there, are, both, internal, and, external, reasons, why, the, person, engages, in, the, behavior, if, both, are, present, they, may, work, against, each, other, for, example, the, presence, of, a, strong, extrinsic, motivation, like, a, high, monetary, reward, can, decrease, intrinsic, motivation, because, of, this, the, individual, may, be, less, likely, to, further, engage, in, the, activity, if, it, does, not, result, in, an, external, reward, anymore, however, this, is, not, always, the, case, and, under, the, right, circumstances, the, combined, effects, of, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, motivation, leads, to, higher, performance, conscious, motivation, involves, motives, of, which, the, person, is, aware, it, includes, the, explicit, recognition, of, goals, and, underlying, values, conscious, motivation, is, associated, with, the, formulation, of, a, goal, and, a, plan, to, realize, it, as, well, as, its, controlled, step, by, step, execution, some, theorists, emphasize, the, role, of, the, self, in, this, process, as, the, entity, that, plans, initiates, regulates, and, evaluates, behavior, an, example, of, conscious, motivation, is, a, person, in, a, clothing, store, who, states, that, they, want, to, buy, a, shirt, and, then, goes, on, to, buy, one, unconscious, motivation, involves, motives, of, which, the, person, is, not, aware, it, can, be, guided, by, deep, rooted, beliefs, desires, and, feelings, operating, beneath, the, level, of, consciousness, examples, include, the, unacknowledged, influences, of, past, experiences, unresolved, conflicts, hidden, fears, and, defense, mechanisms, these, influences, can, affect, decisions, impact, behavior, and, shape, habits, an, example, of, unconscious, motivation, is, a, scientist, who, believes, that, their, research, effort, is, a, pure, expression, of, their, altruistic, desire, to, benefit, science, while, their, true, motive, is, an, unacknowledged, need, for, fame, external, circumstances, can, also, impact, the, motivation, underlying, unconscious, behavior, an, example, is, the, effect, of, priming, in, which, an, earlier, stimulus, influences, the, response, to, a, later, stimulus, without, the, person, s, awareness, of, this, influence, unconscious, motivation, is, a, central, topic, in, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalysis, early, theories, of, motivation, often, assumed, that, conscious, motivation, is, the, primary, form, of, motivation, however, this, view, has, been, challenged, in, the, subsequent, literature, and, there, is, no, academic, consensus, on, the, relative, extent, of, their, influence, closely, related, to, the, contrast, between, conscious, and, unconscious, motivation, is, the, distinction, between, rational, and, irrational, motivation, a, motivational, state, is, rational, if, it, is, based, on, a, good, reason, this, implies, that, the, motive, of, the, behavior, explains, why, the, person, should, engage, in, the, behavior, in, this, case, the, person, has, an, insight, into, why, the, behavior, is, considered, valuable, for, example, if, a, person, saves, a, drowning, child, because, they, value, the, child, s, life, then, their, motivation, is, rational, rational, motivation, contrasts, with, irrational, motivation, in, which, the, person, has, no, good, reason, that, explains, the, behavior, in, this, case, the, person, lacks, a, clear, understanding, of, the, deeper, source, of, motivation, and, in, what, sense, the, behavior, is, in, tune, with, their, values, this, can, be, the, case, for, impulsive, behavior, for, example, when, a, person, spontaneously, acts, out, of, anger, without, reflecting, on, the, consequences, of, their, actions, rational, and, irrational, motivation, play, a, key, role, in, the, field, of, economics, in, order, to, predict, the, behavior, of, economic, actors, it, is, often, assumed, that, they, act, rationally, in, this, field, rational, behavior, is, understood, as, behavior, that, is, in, tune, with, self, interest, while, irrational, behavior, goes, against, self, interest, for, example, based, on, the, assumption, that, it, is, in, the, self, interest, of, firms, to, maximize, profit, actions, that, lead, to, that, outcome, are, considered, rational, while, actions, that, impede, profit, maximization, are, considered, irrational, however, when, understood, in, a, wider, sense, rational, motivation, is, a, broader, term, that, also, includes, behavior, motivated, by, a, desire, to, benefit, others, as, a, form, of, rational, altruism, biological, motivation, concerns, motives, that, arise, due, to, physiological, needs, examples, are, hunger, thirst, sex, and, the, need, for, sleep, they, are, also, referred, to, as, primary, physiological, or, organic, motives, biological, motivation, is, associated, with, states, of, arousal, and, emotional, changes, its, source, lies, in, innate, mechanisms, that, govern, stimulus, response, patterns, cognitive, motivation, concerns, motives, that, arise, from, the, psychological, level, they, include, affiliation, competition, personal, interests, and, self, actualization, as, well, as, desires, for, perfection, justice, beauty, and, truth, they, are, also, called, secondary, psychological, social, or, personal, motives, they, are, often, seen, as, a, higher, or, more, refined, form, of, motivation, the, processing, and, interpretation, of, information, play, a, key, role, in, cognitive, motivation, cognitively, motivated, behavior, is, not, an, innate, reflex, but, a, flexible, response, to, the, available, information, that, is, based, on, past, experiences, and, expected, outcomes, it, is, associated, with, the, explicit, formulation, of, desired, outcomes, and, engagement, in, goal, directed, behavior, to, realize, these, outcomes, some, theories, of, human, motivation, see, biological, causes, as, the, source, of, all, motivation, they, tend, to, conceptualize, human, behavior, in, analogy, to, animal, behavior, other, theories, allow, for, both, biological, and, cognitive, motivation, and, some, put, their, main, emphasis, on, cognitive, motivation, short, term, and, long, term, motivation, differ, in, regard, to, the, temporal, horizon, and, the, duration, of, the, underlying, motivational, mechanism, short, term, motivation, is, focused, on, achieving, rewards, immediately, or, in, the, near, future, it, is, associated, with, impulsive, behavior, it, is, a, transient, and, fluctuating, phenomenon, that, may, arise, and, subside, spontaneously, long, term, motivation, involves, a, sustained, commitment, to, goals, in, a, more, distant, future, it, encompasses, a, willingness, to, invest, time, and, effort, over, an, extended, period, before, the, intended, goal, is, reached, it, is, often, a, more, deliberative, process, that, requires, goal, setting, and, planning, both, short, term, and, long, term, motivation, are, relevant, to, achieving, one, s, goals, for, example, short, term, motivation, is, central, when, responding, to, urgent, problems, while, long, term, motivation, is, a, key, factor, in, pursuing, far, reaching, objectives, however, they, sometimes, conflict, with, each, other, by, supporting, opposing, courses, of, action, an, example, is, a, married, person, who, is, tempted, to, have, a, one, night, stand, in, this, case, there, may, be, a, clash, between, the, short, term, motivation, to, seek, immediate, physical, gratification, and, the, long, term, motivation, to, preserve, and, nurture, a, successful, marriage, built, on, trust, and, commitment, another, example, is, the, long, term, motivation, to, stay, healthy, in, contrast, to, the, short, term, motivation, to, smoke, a, cigarette, the, difference, between, egoistic, and, altruistic, motivation, concerns, who, is, intended, to, benefit, from, the, anticipated, course, of, action, egoistic, motivation, is, driven, by, self, interest, the, person, is, acting, for, their, own, benefit, or, to, fulfill, their, own, needs, and, desires, this, self, interest, can, take, various, forms, including, immediate, pleasure, career, advancement, financial, rewards, and, gaining, respect, from, others, altruistic, motivation, is, marked, by, selfless, intentions, and, involves, a, genuine, concern, for, the, well, being, of, others, it, is, associated, with, the, desire, to, assist, and, help, others, in, a, non, transactional, manner, without, the, goal, of, obtaining, personal, gain, or, rewards, in, return, according, to, the, controversial, thesis, of, psychological, egoism, there, is, no, altruistic, motivation, all, motivation, is, egoistic, proponents, of, this, view, hold, that, even, apparently, altruistic, behavior, is, caused, by, egoistic, motives, for, example, they, may, claim, that, people, feel, good, about, helping, other, people, and, that, their, egoistic, desire, to, feel, good, is, the, true, internal, motivation, behind, the, externally, altruistic, behavior, many, religions, emphasize, the, importance, of, altruistic, motivation, as, a, component, of, religious, practice, for, example, christianity, sees, selfless, love, and, compassion, as, a, way, of, realizing, god, s, will, and, bringing, about, a, better, world, buddhists, emphasize, the, practice, of, loving, kindness, toward, all, sentient, beings, as, a, means, to, eliminate, suffering, many, other, types, of, motivation, are, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, moral, motivation, is, closely, related, to, altruistic, motivation, its, motive, is, to, act, in, tune, with, moral, judgments, and, it, can, be, characterized, as, the, willingness, to, do, the, right, thing, the, desire, to, visit, a, sick, friend, to, keep, a, promise, is, an, example, of, moral, motivation, it, can, conflict, with, other, forms, of, motivation, like, the, desire, to, go, to, the, movies, instead, an, influential, debate, in, moral, philosophy, centers, around, the, question, of, whether, moral, judgments, can, directly, provide, moral, motivation, as, internalists, claim, externalists, provide, an, alternative, explanation, by, holding, that, additional, mental, states, like, desires, or, emotions, are, needed, externalists, hold, that, these, additional, states, do, not, always, accompany, moral, judgments, meaning, that, it, would, be, possible, to, have, moral, judgments, without, a, moral, motivation, to, follow, them, certain, forms, of, psychopathy, and, brain, damage, can, inhibit, moral, motivation, self, determination, theorists, such, as, edward, deci, and, richard, ryan, distinguish, between, autonomous, and, controlled, motivation, autonomous, motivation, is, associated, with, acting, according, to, one, s, free, will, or, doing, something, because, one, wants, to, do, it, in, the, case, of, controlled, motivation, the, person, feels, pressured, into, doing, something, by, external, forces, a, related, contrast, is, between, push, and, pull, motivation, push, motivation, arises, from, unfulfilled, internal, needs, and, aims, at, satisfying, them, for, example, hunger, may, push, an, individual, to, find, something, to, eat, pull, motivation, arises, from, an, external, goal, and, aims, at, achieving, this, goal, like, the, motivation, to, get, a, university, degree, achievement, motivation, is, the, desire, to, overcome, obstacles, and, strive, for, excellence, its, goal, is, to, do, things, well, and, become, better, even, in, the, absence, of, tangible, external, rewards, it, is, closely, related, to, the, fear, of, failure, an, example, of, achievement, motivation, in, sports, is, a, person, who, challenges, stronger, opponents, in, an, attempt, to, get, better, human, motivation, is, sometimes, contrasted, with, animal, motivation, the, field, of, animal, motivation, examines, the, reasons, and, mechanisms, underlying, animal, behavior, it, belongs, to, psychology, and, zoology, it, gives, specific, emphasis, to, the, interplay, of, external, stimulation, and, internal, states, it, further, considers, how, an, animal, benefits, from, a, certain, behavior, as, an, individual, and, in, terms, of, evolution, there, are, important, overlaps, between, the, fields, of, animal, and, human, motivation, studies, on, animal, motivation, tend, to, focus, more, on, the, role, of, external, stimuli, and, instinctive, responses, while, the, role, of, free, decisions, and, delayed, gratification, has, a, more, prominent, place, when, discussing, human, motivation, motivation, contrasts, with, amotivation, also, known, as, avolition, which, is, an, absence, of, interest, individuals, in, the, state, of, amotivation, feel, apathy, or, lack, the, willingness, to, engage, in, a, particular, behavior, for, instance, amotivated, children, at, school, remain, passive, in, class, do, not, engage, in, classroom, activities, and, fail, to, follow, teacher, instructions, amotivation, can, be, a, significant, barrier, to, productivity, goal, attainment, and, overall, well, being, it, can, be, caused, by, factors, like, unrealistic, expectations, helplessness, feelings, of, incompetence, and, the, inability, to, see, how, one, s, actions, affect, outcomes, in, the, field, of, christian, spirituality, the, terms, acedia, and, accidie, are, often, used, to, describe, a, form, of, amotivation, or, listlessness, associated, with, a, failure, to, engage, in, spiritual, practices, amotivation, is, usually, a, temporary, state, the, term, amotivational, syndrome, refers, to, a, more, permanent, and, wide, reaching, condition, it, involves, apathy, and, lack, of, activity, in, relation, to, a, broad, range, of, activities, and, is, associated, with, incoherence, inability, to, concentrate, and, memory, disturbance, the, term, disorders, of, diminished, motivation, covers, a, wide, range, of, related, phenomena, including, abulia, akinetic, mutism, and, other, motivation, related, neurological, disorders, amotivation, is, closely, related, to, akrasia, a, person, in, the, state, of, akrasia, believes, that, they, should, perform, a, certain, action, but, cannot, motivate, themselves, to, do, it, this, means, that, there, is, an, internal, conflict, between, what, a, person, believes, they, should, do, and, what, they, actually, do, the, cause, of, akrasia, is, sometimes, that, a, person, gives, in, to, temptations, and, is, not, able, to, resist, them, for, this, reason, akrasia, is, also, referred, to, as, weakness, of, the, will, an, addict, who, compulsively, consumes, drugs, even, though, they, know, that, it, is, not, in, their, best, self, interest, is, an, example, of, akrasia, akrasia, contrasts, with, enkrasia, which, is, a, state, where, a, person, s, motivation, aligns, with, their, beliefs, theories, of, motivation, are, frameworks, or, sets, of, principles, that, aim, to, explain, motivational, phenomena, they, seek, to, understand, how, motivation, arises, and, what, causes, and, effects, it, has, as, well, as, the, goals, that, commonly, motivate, people, this, way, they, provide, explanations, of, why, an, individual, engages, in, one, behavior, rather, than, another, how, much, effort, they, invest, and, how, long, they, continue, to, strive, toward, a, given, goal, important, debates, in, the, academic, literature, concern, to, what, extent, motivation, is, innate, or, based, on, genetically, determined, instincts, rather, than, learned, through, previous, experience, a, closely, related, issue, is, whether, motivational, processes, are, mechanistic, and, run, automatically, or, have, a, more, complex, nature, involving, cognitive, processes, and, active, decision, making, another, discussion, revolves, around, the, topic, of, whether, the, primary, sources, of, motivation, are, internal, needs, rather, than, external, goals, a, common, distinction, among, theories, of, motivation, is, between, content, theories, and, process, theories, content, theories, attempt, to, identify, and, describe, the, internal, factors, that, motivate, people, such, as, different, types, of, needs, drives, and, desires, they, examine, which, goals, motivate, people, influential, content, theories, are, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, frederick, herzberg, s, two, factor, theory, and, david, mcclelland, s, learned, needs, theory, process, theories, discuss, the, cognitive, emotional, and, decision, making, processes, that, underlie, human, motivation, they, examine, how, people, select, goals, and, the, means, to, achieve, them, major, process, theories, are, expectancy, theory, equity, theory, goal, setting, theory, self, determination, theory, and, reinforcement, theory, another, way, to, classify, theories, of, motivation, focuses, on, the, role, of, inborn, physiological, processes, in, contrast, to, cognitive, processes, and, distinguishes, between, biological, psychological, and, biopsychosocial, theories, maslow, holds, that, humans, have, different, kinds, of, needs, and, that, those, needs, are, responsible, for, motivation, according, to, him, they, form, a, hierarchy, of, needs, that, is, composed, of, lower, and, higher, needs, lower, needs, belong, to, the, physiological, level, and, are, characterized, as, deficiency, needs, since, they, indicate, some, form, of, lack, examples, are, the, desire, for, food, water, and, shelter, higher, needs, belong, to, the, psychological, level, and, are, associated, with, the, potential, to, grow, as, a, person, examples, are, self, esteem, in, the, form, of, a, positive, self, image, and, personal, development, by, actualizing, one, s, unique, talents, and, abilities, two, key, principles, of, maslow, s, theory, are, the, progression, principle, and, the, deficit, principle, they, state, that, lower, needs, have, to, be, fulfilled, before, higher, needs, become, activated, this, means, that, higher, needs, like, esteem, and, self, actualization, are, unable, to, provide, full, motivation, while, lower, needs, like, food, and, shelter, remain, unfulfilled, an, influential, extension, of, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, was, proposed, by, clayton, alderfer, in, the, form, of, his, erg, theory, herzberg, s, two, factor, theory, also, analyzes, motivation, in, terms, of, lower, and, higher, needs, herzberg, applies, it, specifically, to, the, workplace, and, distinguishes, between, lower, lever, hygiene, factors, and, higher, level, motivators, hygiene, factors, are, associated, with, the, work, environment, and, conditions, examples, include, company, policies, supervision, salary, and, job, security, they, are, essential, to, prevent, job, dissatisfaction, and, associated, negative, behavior, such, as, frequent, absence, or, decreased, effort, motivators, are, more, directly, related, to, work, itself, they, include, the, nature, of, the, work, and, the, associated, responsibility, as, well, as, recognition, and, personal, and, professional, growth, opportunities, they, are, responsible, for, job, satisfaction, as, well, as, increased, commitment, and, creativity, this, theory, implies, for, example, that, increasing, salary, and, job, security, may, not, be, sufficient, to, fully, motivate, workers, if, their, higher, needs, are, not, met, mcclelland, s, learned, needs, theory, states, that, individuals, have, three, primary, needs, affiliation, power, and, achievement, the, need, for, affiliation, is, a, desire, to, form, social, connections, with, others, the, need, for, power, is, a, longing, to, exert, control, over, one, s, surroundings, and, wield, influence, over, others, the, need, for, achievement, relates, to, a, yearning, to, establish, ambitious, objectives, and, to, receive, positive, feedback, on, one, s, performance, mcclelland, holds, that, these, needs, are, present, in, everyone, but, that, their, exact, form, strength, and, expression, is, shaped, by, cultural, influences, and, the, individual, s, experiences, for, example, affiliation, oriented, individuals, are, primarily, motivated, by, establishing, and, maintaining, social, relations, while, achievement, oriented, individuals, are, inclined, to, set, challenging, goals, and, strive, for, personal, excellence, more, emphasis, on, the, need, of, affiliation, tends, to, be, given, in, collectivist, cultures, in, contrast, to, a, focus, on, the, need, of, achievement, in, individualist, cultures, expectancy, theory, states, that, whether, a, person, is, motivated, to, perform, a, certain, behavior, depends, on, the, expected, results, of, this, behavior, the, more, positive, the, expected, results, are, the, higher, the, motivation, to, engage, in, that, behavior, expectancy, theorists, understand, the, expected, results, in, terms, of, three, factors, expectancy, instrumentality, and, valence, expectancy, concerns, the, relation, between, effort, and, performance, if, the, expectancy, of, a, behavior, is, high, then, the, person, believes, that, their, efforts, will, likely, result, in, successful, performance, instrumentality, concerns, the, relation, between, performance, and, outcomes, if, the, instrumentality, of, a, performance, is, high, then, the, person, believes, that, it, will, likely, result, in, the, intended, outcomes, valence, is, the, degree, to, which, the, outcomes, are, attractive, to, the, person, these, three, components, affect, each, other, in, a, multiplicative, way, meaning, that, high, motivation, is, only, present, if, all, of, them, are, high, in, this, case, the, person, believes, it, likely, that, they, perform, well, that, the, performance, leads, to, the, expected, result, and, that, the, result, as, a, high, value, equity, theory, sees, fairness, as, a, key, aspect, of, motivation, according, to, it, people, are, interested, in, the, proportion, between, effort, and, reward, they, judge, how, much, energy, one, has, to, invest, and, how, good, the, outcome, is, equity, theory, states, that, individuals, assess, fairness, by, comparing, their, own, ratio, of, effort, and, reward, to, the, ratio, of, others, a, key, idea, of, equity, theory, is, that, people, are, motivated, to, reduce, perceived, inequity, this, is, especially, the, case, if, they, feel, that, they, receive, less, rewards, than, others, for, example, if, an, employee, has, the, impression, that, they, work, longer, than, their, co, workers, while, receiving, the, same, salary, this, may, motivate, them, to, ask, for, a, raise, goal, setting, theory, holds, that, having, clearly, defined, goals, is, one, of, the, key, factors, of, motivation, it, states, that, effective, goals, are, specific, and, challenging, a, goal, is, specific, if, it, involves, a, clear, objective, such, as, a, quantifiable, target, one, intends, to, reach, rather, than, just, trying, to, do, one, s, best, a, goal, is, challenging, if, it, is, achievable, but, hard, to, reach, two, additional, factors, identified, by, goal, setting, theorists, are, goal, commitment, and, self, efficacy, commitment, is, a, person, s, dedication, to, achieving, a, goal, and, includes, an, unwillingness, to, abandon, or, change, the, goal, when, meeting, resistance, to, have, self, efficacy, means, to, believe, in, oneself, and, in, one, s, ability, to, succeed, this, belief, can, help, people, persevere, through, obstacles, and, remain, motivated, to, reach, challenging, goals, according, to, self, determination, theory, the, main, factors, influencing, motivation, are, autonomy, competence, and, connection, people, act, autonomously, if, they, decide, themselves, what, to, do, rather, than, following, orders, this, tends, to, increase, motivation, since, humans, usually, prefer, to, act, in, accordance, with, their, wishes, values, and, goals, without, being, coerced, by, external, forces, if, a, person, is, competent, at, a, certain, task, then, they, tend, to, feel, good, about, the, work, itself, and, its, results, lack, of, competence, can, decrease, motivation, by, leading, to, frustration, if, one, s, efforts, fail, to, succeed, connection, is, another, factor, identified, by, self, determination, theorists, and, concerns, the, social, environment, motivation, tends, to, be, reinforced, for, activities, in, which, a, person, can, positively, relate, to, others, receives, approval, and, can, reach, out, for, help, reinforcement, theory, is, based, on, behaviorism, and, explains, motivation, in, relation, to, positive, and, negative, outcomes, of, previous, behavior, it, uses, the, principle, of, operant, conditioning, which, states, that, behavior, followed, by, positive, consequences, is, more, likely, to, be, repeated, while, behavior, followed, by, negative, consequences, is, less, likely, to, be, repeated, this, theory, predicts, for, example, that, if, an, aggressive, behavior, of, a, child, is, rewarded, then, this, will, reinforce, the, child, s, motivation, for, aggressive, behavior, in, the, future, in, neurology, motivation, is, studied, from, a, physiological, perspective, by, examining, the, brain, processes, and, brain, areas, involved, in, motivational, phenomena, neurology, uses, data, from, both, humans, and, animals, which, it, obtains, through, a, variety, of, methods, including, the, use, of, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, and, positron, emission, tomography, it, investigates, regular, motivational, processes, pathological, cases, and, the, effect, of, possible, treatments, it, is, a, complex, discipline, that, relies, on, insights, from, fields, like, clinical, experimental, and, comparative, psychology, neurologists, understand, motivation, as, a, multifaceted, phenomenon, that, integrates, and, processes, signals, to, make, complex, decisions, and, coordinate, actions, motivation, is, influenced, by, the, organism, s, physiological, state, like, stress, information, about, the, environment, and, personal, history, like, past, experiences, with, this, environment, all, this, information, is, integrated, to, perform, a, cost, benefit, analysis, which, considers, the, time, effort, and, discomfort, associated, with, pursuing, a, goal, as, well, as, positive, outcomes, like, fulfilling, one, s, needs, or, escaping, harm, this, form, of, reward, prediction, is, associated, with, several, brain, areas, like, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, the, anterior, cingulate, and, the, basolateral, amygdala, the, dopamine, system, plays, a, key, role, in, learning, which, positive, and, negative, outcomes, are, associated, with, a, specific, behavior, and, how, certain, signals, like, environmental, cues, are, related, to, specific, goals, through, these, associations, motivation, can, automatically, arise, when, the, signals, are, present, for, example, if, a, person, associates, having, a, certain, type, of, food, with, a, specific, time, of, day, then, they, may, automatically, feel, motivated, to, eat, this, food, when, the, time, arrives, motivation, plays, a, key, role, in, education, since, it, affects, the, students, engagement, with, the, studied, topic, and, shapes, their, learning, experience, and, academic, success, motivated, students, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, classroom, activities, and, persevere, through, challenges, one, of, the, responsibilities, of, educators, and, educational, institutions, is, to, establish, a, learning, environment, that, fosters, and, sustains, students, motivation, to, ensure, effective, learning, educational, research, is, particularly, interested, in, understanding, the, different, effects, that, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, motivation, have, on, the, learning, process, in, the, case, of, intrinsic, motivation, students, are, interested, in, the, subject, and, the, learning, experience, itself, students, driven, by, extrinsic, motivation, seek, external, rewards, like, good, grades, or, peer, recognition, intrinsic, motivation, is, often, seen, as, the, preferred, type, of, motivation, since, it, is, associated, with, more, in, depth, learning, better, memory, retention, and, long, term, commitment, extrinsic, motivation, in, the, form, of, rewards, and, recognition, also, plays, a, key, role, in, the, learning, process, however, it, can, conflict, with, intrinsic, motivation, in, some, cases, and, may, then, hinder, creativity, various, factors, influence, student, motivation, it, is, usually, beneficial, to, have, an, organized, classroom, with, few, distractions, the, learning, material, should, be, neither, too, easy, which, threatens, to, bore, students, nor, too, difficult, which, can, lead, to, frustration, the, behavior, of, the, teacher, also, has, a, significant, impact, on, student, motivation, for, example, in, regard, to, how, the, material, is, presented, the, feedback, they, provide, on, assignments, and, the, interpersonal, relation, they, build, with, the, students, teachers, who, are, patient, and, supportive, can, encourage, interaction, by, interpreting, mistakes, as, learning, opportunities, work, motivation, is, an, often, studied, topic, in, the, fields, of, organization, studies, and, organizational, behavior, they, aim, to, understand, human, motivation, in, the, context, of, organizations, and, investigate, its, role, in, work, and, work, related, activities, including, human, resource, management, employee, selection, training, and, managerial, practices, motivation, plays, a, key, role, in, the, workplace, on, various, levels, it, impacts, how, employees, feel, about, their, work, their, level, of, determination, commitment, and, overall, job, satisfaction, it, also, affects, employee, performance, and, overall, business, success, lack, of, motivation, can, lead, to, decreased, productivity, due, to, complacency, disinterest, and, absenteeism, it, can, also, manifest, in, the, form, of, occupational, burnout, various, factors, influence, work, motivation, they, include, the, personal, needs, and, expectations, of, the, employees, the, characteristics, of, the, tasks, they, perform, and, whether, the, work, conditions, are, perceived, as, fair, and, just, another, key, aspect, is, how, managers, communicate, and, provide, feedback, understanding, and, managing, employee, motivation, is, essential, for, managers, to, ensure, effective, leadership, employee, performance, and, business, success, cultural, differences, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, how, to, motivate, workers, for, example, workers, from, economically, advanced, countries, may, respond, better, to, higher, order, goals, like, self, actualization, while, the, fulfillment, of, more, basic, needs, tends, to, be, more, central, for, workers, from, less, economically, developed, countries, there, are, different, approaches, to, increasing, employee, motivation, some, focus, on, material, benefits, like, high, salary, health, care, stock, ownership, plans, profit, sharing, and, company, cars, others, aim, to, make, changes, to, the, design, of, the, job, itself, for, example, overly, simplified, and, segmented, jobs, tend, to, result, in, decreased, productivity, and, lower, employee, morale, the, dynamics, of, motivation, differ, between, paid, work, and, volunteer, work, intrinsic, motivation, plays, a, larger, role, for, volunteers, with, key, motivators, being, self, esteem, the, desire, to, help, others, career, advancement, and, self, improvement, motivation, is, a, fundamental, aspect, of, sports, it, affects, how, consistently, athletes, train, how, much, effort, they, are, willing, to, invest, and, how, well, they, persevere, through, challenges, proper, motivation, is, an, influential, factor, for, athletic, success, it, concerns, both, the, long, term, motivation, needed, to, sustain, progress, and, commitment, over, an, extended, period, as, well, as, the, short, term, motivation, required, to, mobilize, as, much, energy, as, possible, for, a, high, performance, on, the, same, day, it, is, the, responsibility, of, coaches, not, just, to, advise, and, instruct, athletes, on, training, plans, and, strategies, but, also, to, motivate, them, to, put, in, the, required, effort, and, give, their, best, there, a, different, coaching, styles, and, the, right, approach, may, depend, on, the, personalities, of, the, coach, the, athlete, and, the, group, as, well, as, the, general, athletic, situation, some, styles, focus, on, realizing, a, particular, goal, while, others, concentrate, on, teaching, following, certain, principles, or, building, a, positive, interpersonal, relationship, the, motive, of, a, crime, is, a, key, aspect, in, criminal, law, it, refers, to, reasons, that, the, accused, had, for, committing, a, crime, motives, are, often, used, as, evidence, to, demonstrate, why, the, accused, might, have, committed, the, crime, and, how, they, would, benefit, from, it, the, absence, of, a, motive, can, be, used, as, evidence, to, put, the, accused, s, involvement, in, the, crime, into, doubt, for, example, financial, gain, is, a, motive, to, commit, a, crime, from, which, the, perpetrator, would, financially, benefit, like, embezzlement, as, a, technical, term, motive, is, distinguished, from, intent, intent, is, the, mental, state, of, the, defendant, and, belongs, to, mens, rea, a, motive, is, a, reason, that, tempts, a, person, to, form, an, intent, unlike, intent, motive, is, usually, not, an, essential, element, of, a, crime, it, plays, various, roles, in, investigative, considerations, but, is, normally, not, required, to, establish, the, defendant, s, guilt, in, a, different, sense, motivation, also, plays, a, role, in, justifying, why, convicted, offenders, should, be, punished, according, to, the, deterrence, theory, of, law, one, key, aspect, of, punishment, for, law, violation, is, to, motivate, both, the, convicted, individual, and, potential, future, wrongdoers, to, not, engage, in, similar, criminal, behavior, motivation, is, a, central, factor, in, implementing, and, maintaining, lifestyle, changes, in, the, fields, of, personal, development, and, health, personal, development, is, a, process, of, self, improvement, aimed, at, enhancing, one, s, skills, knowledge, talents, and, overall, well, being, it, is, realized, through, practices, that, promote, growth, and, improve, different, areas, in, one, s, life, motivation, is, pivotal, in, engaging, in, these, practices, it, is, especially, relevant, to, ensure, long, term, commitment, and, to, follow, through, with, one, s, plans, for, example, health, related, lifestyle, changes, may, at, times, require, high, willpower, and, self, control, to, implement, meaningful, adjustments, while, resisting, impulses, and, bad, habits, this, is, the, case, when, trying, to, resist, urges, to, smoke, consume, alcohol, and, eat, fattening, food, motivation, plays, a, key, role, in, economics, since, it, is, what, drives, individuals, and, organizations, to, make, economic, decisions, and, engage, in, economic, activities, it, affects, diverse, processes, involving, consumer, behavior, labor, supply, and, investment, decisions, for, example, rational, choice, theory, a, fundamental, theory, in, economics, postulates, that, individuals, are, motivated, by, self, interest, and, aim, to, maximize, their, utility, which, guides, economic, behavior, like, consumption, choices, in, video, games, player, motivation, is, what, drives, people, to, play, a, game, and, engage, with, its, contents, player, motivation, often, revolves, around, completing, certain, objectives, like, solving, a, puzzle, beating, an, enemy, or, exploring, the, game, world, it, concerns, both, smaller, objectives, within, a, part, of, the, game, as, well, as, finishing, the, game, as, a, whole, understanding, different, types, of, player, motivation, helps, game, designers, make, their, games, immersive, and, appealing, to, a, wide, audience, motivation, is, also, relevant, in, the, field, of, politics, this, is, true, specifically, for, democracies, to, ensure, active, engagement, participation, and, voting
