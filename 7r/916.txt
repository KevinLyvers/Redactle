a, navy, naval, force, military, maritime, fleet, war, navy, or, maritime, force, is, the, branch, of, a, nation, s, armed, forces, principally, designated, for, naval, and, amphibious, warfare, namely, lake, borne, riverine, littoral, or, ocean, borne, combat, operations, and, related, functions, it, includes, anything, conducted, by, surface, ships, amphibious, ships, submarines, and, seaborne, aviation, as, well, as, ancillary, support, communications, training, and, other, fields, the, strategic, offensive, role, of, a, navy, is, projection, of, force, into, areas, beyond, a, country, s, shores, for, example, to, protect, sea, lanes, deter, or, confront, piracy, ferry, troops, or, attack, other, navies, ports, or, shore, installations, the, strategic, defensive, purpose, of, a, navy, is, to, frustrate, seaborne, projection, of, force, by, enemies, the, strategic, task, of, the, navy, also, may, incorporate, nuclear, deterrence, by, use, of, submarine, launched, ballistic, missiles, naval, operations, can, be, broadly, divided, between, riverine, and, littoral, applications, brown, water, navy, open, ocean, applications, blue, water, navy, and, something, in, between, green, water, navy, although, these, distinctions, are, more, about, strategic, scope, than, tactical, or, operational, division, first, attested, in, english, in, the, early, 14th, century, the, word, navy, came, via, old, french, navie, fleet, of, ships, from, the, latin, navigium, a, vessel, a, ship, bark, boat, from, navis, ship, the, word, naval, came, from, latin, navalis, pertaining, to, ship, cf, greek, naus, ship, nautes, seaman, sailor, the, earliest, attested, form, of, the, word, is, in, the, mycenaean, greek, compound, word, na, u, do, mo, naudomoi, shipbuilders, written, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, the, word, formerly, denoted, fleets, of, both, commercial, and, military, nature, in, modern, usage, navy, used, alone, always, denotes, a, military, fleet, although, the, term, merchant, navy, for, a, commercial, fleet, still, incorporates, the, non, military, word, sense, this, overlap, in, word, senses, between, commercial, and, military, fleets, grew, out, of, the, inherently, dual, use, nature, of, fleets, centuries, ago, nationality, was, a, trait, that, unified, a, fleet, across, both, civilian, and, military, uses, although, nationality, of, commercial, vessels, has, little, importance, in, peacetime, trade, other, than, for, tax, avoidance, it, can, have, greater, meaning, during, wartime, when, supply, chains, become, matters, of, patriotic, attack, and, defense, and, when, in, some, cases, private, vessels, are, even, temporarily, converted, to, military, vessels, the, latter, was, especially, important, and, common, before, 20th, century, military, technology, existed, when, merely, adding, artillery, and, naval, infantry, to, any, sailing, vessel, could, render, it, fully, as, martial, as, any, military, owned, vessel, such, privateering, has, been, rendered, obsolete, in, blue, water, strategy, since, modern, missile, and, aircraft, systems, grew, to, leapfrog, over, artillery, and, infantry, in, many, respects, but, privateering, nevertheless, remains, potentially, relevant, in, littoral, warfare, of, a, limited, and, asymmetric, nature, naval, warfare, developed, when, humans, first, fought, from, water, borne, vessels, before, the, introduction, of, the, cannon, and, ships, with, enough, capacity, to, carry, them, navy, warfare, primarily, involved, ramming, and, boarding, actions, in, the, time, of, ancient, greece, and, the, roman, empire, naval, warfare, centered, on, long, narrow, vessels, powered, by, banks, of, oarsmen, such, as, triremes, and, quinqueremes, designed, to, ram, and, sink, enemy, vessels, or, come, alongside, the, enemy, vessel, so, its, occupants, could, be, attacked, hand, to, hand, naval, warfare, continued, in, this, vein, through, the, middle, ages, until, the, cannon, became, commonplace, and, capable, of, being, reloaded, quickly, enough, to, be, reused, in, the, same, battle, in, ancient, china, large, naval, battles, were, known, since, the, qin, dynasty, also, see, battle, of, red, cliffs, 208, employing, the, war, junk, during, the, han, dynasty, however, china, s, first, official, standing, navy, was, not, established, until, the, southern, song, dynasty, in, the, 12th, century, a, time, when, gunpowder, was, a, revolutionary, new, application, to, warfare, the, chola, dynasty, in, southern, india, had, a, navy, composed, of, trade, ships, transporting, armies, overseas, the, chola, navy, reached, its, peak, under, rajendra, i, and, was, most, notably, used, in, invasions, of, sri, lanka, and, southeast, asia, nusantaran, thalassocracies, made, extensive, use, of, naval, power, and, technologies, this, enabled, the, seafaring, local, people, either, malays, of, srivijaya, or, javanese, of, mataram, to, attack, as, far, as, the, coast, of, tanzania, and, mozambique, with, 1000, boats, and, attempted, to, take, the, citadel, of, qanbaloh, about, 7, 000, km, to, their, west, in, 945, 946, ad, 110, 39, in, 1350, ad, majapahit, launched, its, largest, military, expedition, the, invasion, of, pasai, with, 400, large, jong, and, innumerable, smaller, vessels, the, second, largest, military, expedition, invasion, of, singapura, in, 1398, majapahit, deployed, 300, jong, with, no, less, than, 200, 000, men, the, average, jong, used, by, majapahit, would, be, about, 76, 18, 79, 81, m, loa, carrying, 600, 700, men, with, 1200, 1400, tons, deadweight, 60, 62, the, mass, and, deck, space, required, to, carry, a, large, number, of, cannon, made, oar, based, propulsion, impossible, and, ships, came, to, rely, primarily, on, sails, warships, were, designed, to, carry, increasing, numbers, of, cannon, and, naval, tactics, evolved, to, bring, a, ship, s, firepower, to, bear, in, a, broadside, with, ships, of, the, line, arranged, in, a, line, of, battle, the, development, of, large, capacity, sail, powered, ships, carrying, cannon, led, to, a, rapid, expansion, of, european, navies, especially, the, spanish, and, portuguese, navies, which, dominated, in, the, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, and, helped, propel, the, age, of, exploration, and, colonialism, the, repulsion, of, the, spanish, armada, 1588, by, the, english, fleet, revolutionized, naval, warfare, by, the, success, of, a, guns, only, strategy, and, caused, a, major, overhaul, of, the, spanish, navy, partly, along, english, lines, which, resulted, in, even, greater, dominance, by, the, spanish, from, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, the, dutch, cannibalized, the, portuguese, empire, in, the, east, and, with, the, immense, wealth, gained, challenged, spanish, hegemony, at, sea, from, the, 1620s, dutch, raiders, seriously, troubled, spanish, shipping, and, after, a, number, of, battles, which, went, both, ways, the, dutch, navy, finally, broke, the, long, dominance, of, the, spanish, navy, in, the, battle, of, the, downs, 1639, england, emerged, as, a, major, naval, power, in, the, mid, 17th, century, in, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, with, a, technical, victory, successive, decisive, dutch, victories, in, the, second, and, third, anglo, dutch, wars, confirmed, the, dutch, mastery, of, the, seas, during, the, dutch, golden, age, financed, by, the, expansion, of, the, dutch, empire, the, french, navy, won, some, important, victories, near, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, but, a, focus, upon, land, forces, led, to, the, french, navy, s, relative, neglect, which, allowed, the, royal, navy, to, emerge, with, an, ever, growing, advantage, in, size, and, quality, especially, in, tactics, and, experience, from, 1695, as, a, response, to, growing, naval, influence, of, the, navies, of, portuguese, the, warrior, king, of, the, marathas, shivaji, laid, the, foundation, of, the, maratha, navy, in, 1654, throughout, the, 18th, century, the, royal, navy, gradually, gained, ascendancy, over, the, french, navy, with, victories, in, the, war, of, spanish, succession, 1701, 1714, inconclusive, battles, in, the, war, of, austrian, succession, 1740, 1748, victories, in, the, seven, years, war, 1754, 1763, a, partial, reversal, during, the, american, war, of, independence, 1775, 1783, and, consolidation, into, uncontested, supremacy, during, the, 19th, century, from, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, these, conflicts, saw, the, development, and, refinement, of, tactics, which, came, to, be, called, the, line, of, battle, the, next, stage, in, the, evolution, of, naval, warfare, was, the, introduction, of, metal, plating, along, the, hull, sides, the, increased, mass, required, steam, powered, engines, resulting, in, an, arms, race, between, armor, and, weapon, thickness, and, firepower, the, first, armored, vessels, the, french, gloire, and, british, hms, warrior, made, wooden, vessels, obsolete, another, significant, improvement, came, with, the, invention, of, the, rotating, turrets, which, allowed, the, guns, to, be, aimed, independently, of, ship, movement, the, battle, between, css, virginia, and, uss, monitor, during, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, is, often, cited, as, the, beginning, of, this, age, of, maritime, conflict, the, russian, navy, was, considered, the, third, strongest, in, the, world, on, the, eve, of, the, russo, japanese, war, which, turned, to, be, a, catastrophe, for, the, russian, military, in, general, and, the, russian, navy, in, particular, although, neither, party, lacked, courage, the, russians, were, defeated, by, the, japanese, in, the, battle, of, port, arthur, which, was, the, first, time, in, warfare, that, mines, were, used, for, offensive, purposes, the, warships, of, the, baltic, fleet, sent, to, the, far, east, were, lost, in, the, battle, of, tsushima, a, further, step, change, in, naval, firepower, occurred, when, the, united, kingdom, launched, hms, dreadnought, in, 1906, but, naval, tactics, still, emphasized, the, line, of, battle, the, first, practical, military, submarines, were, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, by, the, end, of, world, war, i, had, proven, to, be, a, powerful, arm, of, naval, warfare, during, world, war, ii, nazi, germany, s, submarine, fleet, of, u, boats, almost, starved, the, united, kingdom, into, submission, and, inflicted, tremendous, losses, on, u, s, coastal, shipping, the, german, battleship, tirpitz, a, sister, ship, of, bismarck, was, almost, put, out, of, action, by, miniature, submarines, known, as, x, craft, the, x, craft, severely, damaged, her, and, kept, her, in, port, for, some, months, a, major, paradigm, shift, in, naval, warfare, occurred, with, the, introduction, of, the, aircraft, carrier, first, at, taranto, in, 1940, and, then, at, pearl, harbor, in, 1941, the, carrier, demonstrated, its, ability, to, strike, decisively, at, enemy, ships, out, of, sight, and, range, of, surface, vessels, the, battle, of, leyte, gulf, 1944, was, arguably, the, largest, naval, battle, in, history, it, was, also, the, last, battle, in, which, battleships, played, a, significant, role, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, carrier, had, become, the, dominant, force, of, naval, warfare, world, war, ii, also, saw, the, united, states, become, by, far, the, largest, naval, power, in, the, world, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, united, states, navy, possessed, over, 70, of, the, world, s, total, numbers, and, total, tonnage, of, naval, vessels, of, 1, 000, tons, or, greater, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 20th, century, the, united, states, navy, would, maintain, a, tonnage, greater, than, that, of, the, next, 17, largest, navies, combined, during, the, cold, war, the, soviet, navy, became, a, significant, armed, force, with, large, numbers, of, large, heavily, armed, ballistic, missile, submarines, and, extensive, use, of, heavy, long, ranged, antisurface, missiles, to, counter, the, numerous, united, states, carrier, battle, groups, only, two, nations, the, united, states, and, france, presently, operate, catobar, carriers, of, any, size, while, russia, china, and, india, operate, sizeable, stobar, carriers, although, all, three, are, originally, of, russian, design, the, united, kingdom, is, also, operating, two, queen, elizabeth, class, carriers, which, are, the, largest, stovl, vessels, in, service, and, india, is, currently, building, one, aircraft, carrier, ins, vikrant, and, considering, another, france, is, also, looking, at, a, new, carrier, probably, using, a, catobar, system, and, possibly, based, on, the, british, queen, elizabeth, design, a, navy, typically, operates, from, one, or, more, naval, bases, the, base, is, a, port, that, is, specialized, in, naval, operations, and, often, includes, housing, a, munitions, depot, docks, for, the, vessels, and, various, repair, facilities, during, times, of, war, temporary, bases, may, be, constructed, in, closer, proximity, to, strategic, locations, as, it, is, advantageous, in, terms, of, patrols, and, station, keeping, nations, with, historically, strong, naval, forces, have, found, it, advantageous, to, obtain, basing, rights, in, other, countries, in, areas, of, strategic, interest, navy, ships, can, operate, independently, or, with, a, group, which, may, be, a, small, squadron, of, comparable, ships, or, a, larger, naval, fleet, of, various, specialized, ships, the, commander, of, a, fleet, travels, in, the, flagship, which, is, usually, the, most, powerful, vessel, in, the, group, before, radio, was, invented, commands, from, the, flagship, were, communicated, by, means, of, flags, at, night, signal, lamps, could, be, used, for, a, similar, purpose, later, these, were, replaced, by, the, radio, transmitter, or, the, flashing, light, when, radio, silence, was, needed, a, blue, water, navy, is, designed, to, operate, far, from, the, coastal, waters, of, its, home, nation, these, are, ships, capable, of, maintaining, station, for, long, periods, of, time, in, deep, ocean, and, will, have, a, long, logistical, tail, for, their, support, many, are, also, nuclear, powered, to, save, having, to, refuel, by, contrast, a, brown, water, navy, operates, in, the, coastal, periphery, and, along, inland, waterways, where, larger, ocean, going, naval, vessels, can, not, readily, enter, regional, powers, may, maintain, a, green, water, navy, as, a, means, of, localized, force, projection, blue, water, fleets, may, require, specialized, vessels, such, as, minesweepers, when, operating, in, the, littoral, regions, along, the, coast, a, basic, tradition, is, that, all, ships, commissioned, in, a, navy, are, referred, to, as, ships, rather, than, vessels, with, the, exception, of, destroyers, and, submarines, which, are, known, as, boats, the, prefix, on, a, ship, s, name, indicates, that, it, is, a, commissioned, ship, an, important, tradition, on, board, naval, vessels, of, some, nations, has, been, the, ship, s, bell, this, was, historically, used, to, mark, the, passage, of, time, as, warning, devices, in, heavy, fog, and, for, alarms, and, ceremonies, the, ship, s, captain, and, more, senior, officers, are, piped, aboard, the, ship, using, a, boatswain, s, call, in, the, united, states, the, first, navy, jack, is, a, flag, that, has, the, words, don, t, tread, on, me, on, the, flag, by, english, tradition, ships, have, been, referred, to, as, a, she, however, it, was, long, considered, bad, luck, to, permit, women, to, sail, on, board, naval, vessels, to, do, so, would, invite, a, terrible, storm, that, would, wreck, the, ship, the, only, women, that, were, welcomed, on, board, were, figureheads, mounted, on, the, prow, of, the, ship, firing, a, cannon, salute, partially, disarms, the, ship, so, firing, a, cannon, for, no, combat, reason, showed, respect, and, trust, as, the, tradition, evolved, the, number, of, cannon, fired, became, an, indication, of, the, rank, of, the, official, being, saluted, historically, navy, ships, were, primarily, intended, for, warfare, they, were, designed, to, withstand, damage, and, to, inflict, the, same, but, only, carried, munitions, and, supplies, for, the, voyage, rather, than, merchant, cargo, often, other, ships, which, were, not, built, specifically, for, warfare, such, as, the, galleon, or, the, armed, merchant, ships, in, world, war, ii, did, carry, armaments, in, more, recent, times, navy, ships, have, become, more, specialized, and, have, included, supply, ships, troop, transports, repair, ships, oil, tankers, and, other, logistics, support, ships, as, well, as, combat, ships, modern, navy, combat, ships, are, generally, divided, into, seven, main, categories, aircraft, carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and, amphibious, assault, ships, there, are, also, support, and, auxiliary, ships, including, the, oiler, minesweeper, patrol, boat, hydrographic, and, oceanographic, survey, ship, and, tender, during, the, age, of, sail, the, ship, categories, were, divided, into, the, ship, of, the, line, frigate, and, sloop, of, war, naval, ship, names, are, typically, prefixed, by, an, abbreviation, indicating, the, national, navy, in, which, they, serve, for, a, list, of, the, prefixes, used, with, ship, names, hms, uss, l, etc, see, ship, prefix, today, s, warships, are, significantly, faster, than, in, years, past, thanks, to, much, improved, propulsion, systems, also, the, efficiency, of, the, engines, has, improved, in, terms, of, fuel, and, of, how, many, sailors, it, takes, to, operate, them, in, world, war, ii, ships, needed, to, refuel, very, often, however, today, ships, can, go, on, very, long, journeys, without, refueling, also, in, world, war, ii, the, engine, room, needed, about, a, dozen, sailors, to, work, the, many, engines, however, today, only, about, 4, 5, are, needed, depending, on, the, class, of, the, ship, today, naval, strike, groups, on, longer, missions, are, always, followed, by, a, range, of, support, and, replenishment, ships, supplying, them, with, anything, from, fuel, and, munitions, to, medical, treatment, and, postal, services, this, allows, strike, groups, and, combat, ships, to, remain, at, sea, for, several, months, at, a, time, the, term, boat, refers, to, small, craft, limited, in, their, use, by, size, and, usually, not, capable, of, making, lengthy, independent, voyages, at, sea, the, old, navy, adage, to, differentiate, between, ships, and, boats, is, that, boats, are, capable, of, being, carried, by, ships, submarines, by, this, rule, are, ships, rather, than, boats, but, are, customarily, referred, to, as, boats, reflecting, their, previous, smaller, size, navies, use, many, types, of, boat, ranging, from, 9, foot, 2, 7, m, dinghies, to, 135, foot, 41, m, landing, craft, they, are, powered, by, either, diesel, engines, out, board, gasoline, engines, or, waterjets, most, boats, are, built, of, aluminum, fiberglass, or, steel, rigid, hulled, inflatable, boats, are, also, used, patrol, boats, are, used, for, patrols, of, coastal, areas, lakes, and, large, rivers, landing, craft, are, designed, to, carry, troops, vehicles, or, cargo, from, ship, to, shore, under, combat, conditions, to, unload, to, withdraw, from, the, beach, and, to, return, to, the, ship, they, are, rugged, with, powerful, engines, and, usually, armed, there, are, many, types, in, today, s, navies, including, hovercraft, they, will, typically, have, a, power, operated, bow, ramp, a, cargo, well, and, after, structures, that, house, engine, rooms, pilot, houses, and, stowage, compartments, these, boats, are, sometimes, carried, by, larger, ships, special, operations, craft, are, high, speed, craft, used, for, insertion, and, extraction, of, special, forces, personnel, and, some, may, be, transportable, and, deployed, by, air, boats, used, in, non, combat, roles, include, lifeboats, mail, boats, line, handling, boats, buoy, boats, aircraft, rescue, boats, torpedo, retrievers, explosive, ordnance, disposal, craft, utility, boats, dive, boats, targets, and, work, boats, boats, are, also, used, for, survey, work, tending, divers, and, minesweeping, operations, boats, for, carrying, cargo, and, personnel, are, sometimes, known, as, launches, gigs, barges, or, shore, party, boats, naval, forces, are, typically, arranged, into, units, based, on, the, number, of, ships, included, a, single, ship, being, the, smallest, operational, unit, ships, may, be, combined, into, squadrons, or, flotillas, which, may, be, formed, into, fleets, the, largest, unit, size, may, be, the, whole, navy, or, admiralty, a, task, force, can, be, assembled, using, ships, from, different, fleets, for, an, operational, task, despite, their, acceptance, in, many, areas, of, naval, service, female, sailors, were, not, permitted, to, serve, on, board, u, s, submarines, until, the, u, s, navy, lifted, the, ban, in, april, 2010, the, major, reasons, historically, cited, by, the, u, s, navy, were, the, extended, duty, tours, and, close, conditions, which, afford, almost, no, privacy, the, united, kingdom, s, royal, navy, has, had, similar, restrictions, australia, canada, norway, and, spain, previously, opened, submarine, service, to, women, sailors, a, navy, will, typically, have, two, sets, of, ranks, one, for, enlisted, personnel, and, one, for, officers, typical, ranks, for, commissioned, officers, include, the, following, in, ascending, order, commonwealth, ranks, are, listed, first, on, each, line, usa, ranks, are, listed, second, in, those, instances, where, they, differ, from, commonwealth, ranks, flag, officers, include, any, rank, that, includes, the, word, admiral, or, commodore, in, services, other, than, the, us, navy, and, are, generally, in, command, of, a, battle, group, strike, group, or, similar, flotilla, of, ships, rather, than, a, single, ship, or, aspect, of, a, ship, however, commodores, can, also, be, temporary, or, honorary, positions, for, example, during, world, war, ii, a, navy, captain, was, assigned, duty, as, a, convoy, commodore, which, meant, that, he, was, still, a, captain, but, in, charge, of, all, the, merchant, vessels, in, the, convoy, the, most, senior, rank, employed, by, a, navy, will, tend, to, vary, depending, on, the, size, of, the, navy, and, whether, it, is, wartime, or, peacetime, for, example, few, people, have, ever, held, the, rank, of, fleet, admiral, in, the, u, s, navy, the, chief, of, the, royal, australian, navy, holds, the, rank, of, vice, admiral, and, the, chief, of, the, irish, naval, service, holds, the, rank, of, commodore, naval, infantry, commonly, known, as, marines, are, a, category, of, infantry, that, form, part, of, a, state, s, naval, forces, and, perform, roles, on, land, and, at, sea, including, amphibious, operations, as, well, as, other, naval, roles, they, also, perform, other, tasks, including, land, warfare, separate, from, naval, operations, during, the, era, of, the, roman, empire, naval, forces, included, marine, legionaries, for, maritime, boarding, actions, these, were, troops, primarily, trained, in, land, warfare, and, did, not, need, to, be, skilled, at, handling, a, ship, much, later, during, the, age, of, sail, a, component, of, marines, served, a, similar, role, being, ship, borne, soldiers, who, were, used, either, during, boarding, actions, as, sharp, shooters, or, in, raids, along, shorelines, the, spanish, infanter, a, de, marina, was, formed, in, 1537, making, it, the, oldest, current, marine, force, in, the, world, the, british, royal, marines, combine, being, both, a, ship, based, force, and, also, being, specially, trained, in, commando, frogman, style, operations, and, tactics, operating, in, some, cases, separately, from, the, rest, of, the, royal, navy, the, royal, marines, also, have, their, own, special, forces, unit, in, the, majority, of, countries, the, marine, force, is, an, integral, part, of, the, navy, but, there, are, variations, such, as, the, french, troupes, de, marine, which, is, actually, part, of, the, french, army, the, united, states, marine, corps, is, a, separate, armed, service, within, the, united, states, department, of, the, navy, with, its, own, leadership, structure, naval, aviation, is, the, application, of, military, air, power, by, navies, whether, from, warships, that, embark, aircraft, or, land, bases, in, world, war, i, several, navies, used, floatplanes, and, flying, boats, mainly, for, scouting, by, world, war, ii, aircraft, carriers, could, carry, bomber, aircraft, capable, of, attacking, naval, and, land, targets, as, well, as, fighter, aircraft, for, defence, since, world, war, ii, helicopters, have, been, embarked, on, smaller, ships, in, roles, such, as, anti, submarine, warfare, and, transport, some, navies, have, also, operated, land, based, aircraft, in, roles, such, as, maritime, patrol, and, training, naval, aviation, forces, primarily, perform, naval, roles, at, sea, however, they, are, also, used, in, a, variety, of, other, roles
