legend, unrounded, rounded, a, vowel, is, a, syllabic, speech, sound, pronounced, without, any, stricture, in, the, vocal, tract, vowels, are, one, of, the, two, principal, classes, of, speech, sounds, the, other, being, the, consonant, vowels, vary, in, quality, in, loudness, and, also, in, quantity, length, they, are, usually, voiced, and, are, closely, involved, in, prosodic, variation, such, as, tone, intonation, and, stress, the, word, vowel, comes, from, the, latin, word, vocalis, meaning, vocal, i, e, relating, to, the, voice, in, english, the, word, vowel, is, commonly, used, to, refer, both, to, vowel, sounds, and, to, the, written, symbols, that, represent, them, a, e, i, o, u, and, sometimes, w, and, y, there, are, two, complementary, definitions, of, vowel, one, phonetic, and, the, other, phonological, the, phonetic, definition, of, vowel, i, e, a, sound, produced, with, no, constriction, in, the, vocal, tract, does, not, always, match, the, phonological, definition, i, e, a, sound, that, forms, the, peak, of, a, syllable, the, approximants, and, illustrate, this, both, are, without, much, of, a, constriction, in, the, vocal, tract, so, phonetically, they, seem, to, be, vowel, like, but, they, occur, at, the, onset, of, syllables, e, g, in, yet, and, wet, which, suggests, that, phonologically, they, are, consonants, a, similar, debate, arises, over, whether, a, word, like, bird, in, a, rhotic, dialect, has, an, r, colored, vowel, or, a, syllabic, consonant, the, american, linguist, kenneth, pike, 1943, suggested, the, terms, vocoid, for, a, phonetic, vowel, and, vowel, for, a, phonological, vowel, so, using, this, terminology, and, are, classified, as, vocoids, but, not, vowels, however, maddieson, and, emmory, 1985, demonstrated, from, a, range, of, languages, that, semivowels, are, produced, with, a, narrower, constriction, of, the, vocal, tract, than, vowels, and, so, may, be, considered, consonants, on, that, basis, nonetheless, the, phonetic, and, phonemic, definitions, would, still, conflict, for, the, syllabic, l, in, table, or, the, syllabic, nasals, in, button, and, rhythm, the, traditional, view, of, vowel, production, reflected, for, example, in, the, terminology, and, presentation, of, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, is, one, of, articulatory, features, that, determine, a, vowel, s, quality, as, distinguishing, it, from, other, vowels, daniel, jones, developed, the, cardinal, vowel, system, to, describe, vowels, in, terms, of, the, features, of, tongue, height, vertical, dimension, tongue, backness, horizontal, dimension, and, roundedness, lip, articulation, these, three, parameters, are, indicated, in, the, schematic, quadrilateral, ipa, vowel, diagram, on, the, right, there, are, additional, features, of, vowel, quality, such, as, the, velum, position, nasality, type, of, vocal, fold, vibration, phonation, and, tongue, root, position, this, conception, of, vowel, articulation, has, been, known, to, be, inaccurate, since, 1928, peter, ladefoged, has, said, that, early, phoneticians, thought, they, were, describing, the, highest, point, of, the, tongue, but, they, were, not, they, were, actually, describing, formant, frequencies, see, below, the, ipa, handbook, concedes, that, the, vowel, quadrilateral, must, be, regarded, as, an, abstraction, and, not, a, direct, mapping, of, tongue, position, nonetheless, the, concept, that, vowel, qualities, are, determined, primarily, by, tongue, position, and, lip, rounding, continues, to, be, used, in, pedagogy, as, it, provides, an, intuitive, explanation, of, how, vowels, are, distinguished, theoretically, vowel, height, refers, to, the, vertical, position, of, either, the, tongue, or, the, jaw, depending, on, the, model, relative, to, either, the, roof, of, the, mouth, or, the, aperture, of, the, jaw, in, practice, however, it, refers, to, the, first, formant, lowest, resonance, of, the, voice, abbreviated, f1, which, is, associated, with, the, height, of, the, tongue, in, close, vowels, also, known, as, high, vowels, such, as, and, the, first, formant, is, consistent, with, the, tongue, being, positioned, close, to, the, palate, high, in, the, mouth, whereas, in, open, vowels, also, known, as, low, vowels, such, as, f1, is, consistent, with, the, jaw, being, open, and, the, tongue, being, positioned, low, in, the, mouth, height, is, defined, by, the, inverse, of, the, f1, value, the, higher, the, frequency, of, the, first, formant, the, lower, more, open, the, vowel, in, john, esling, s, usage, where, fronted, vowels, are, distinguished, in, height, by, the, position, of, the, jaw, rather, than, the, tongue, only, the, terms, open, and, close, are, used, as, high, and, low, refer, to, the, position, of, the, tongue, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, has, letters, for, six, degrees, of, vowel, height, for, full, vowels, plus, the, reduced, mid, vowel, but, it, is, extremely, unusual, for, a, language, to, distinguish, this, many, degrees, without, other, attributes, the, ipa, letters, distinguish, the, letters, e, o, are, defined, as, close, mid, but, are, commonly, used, for, true, mid, vowels, if, more, precision, is, required, true, mid, vowels, may, be, written, with, a, lowering, or, raising, diacritic, e, o, or, the, kensiu, language, spoken, in, malaysia, and, thailand, is, highly, unusual, in, contrasting, true, mid, vowels, with, both, close, mid, and, open, mid, vowels, without, any, additional, parameters, such, as, length, roundness, or, atr, the, front, vowels, i, e, e, along, with, open, a, make, a, six, way, height, distinction, this, holds, even, for, the, nasal, vowels, a, few, varieties, of, german, have, been, reported, to, have, five, contrastive, vowel, heights, that, are, independent, of, length, or, other, parameters, for, example, the, bavarian, dialect, of, amstetten, has, thirteen, long, vowels, which, have, been, analyzed, as, four, vowel, heights, close, close, mid, mid, open, mid, each, among, the, front, unrounded, front, rounded, and, back, rounded, vowels, along, with, an, open, vowel, for, a, fifth, height, i, e, y, u, o, a, apart, from, the, aforementioned, kensiu, language, no, other, language, is, known, to, contrast, more, than, four, degrees, of, vowel, height, the, parameter, of, vowel, height, appears, to, be, the, primary, cross, linguistic, feature, of, vowels, in, that, all, spoken, languages, that, have, been, researched, till, now, use, height, as, a, contrastive, feature, no, other, parameter, even, backness, or, rounding, see, below, is, used, in, all, languages, some, languages, have, vertical, vowel, systems, in, which, at, least, at, a, phonemic, level, only, height, is, used, to, distinguish, vowels, vowel, backness, is, named, for, the, position, of, the, tongue, during, the, articulation, of, a, vowel, relative, to, the, back, of, the, mouth, as, with, vowel, height, however, it, is, defined, by, a, formant, of, the, voice, in, this, case, the, second, f2, not, by, the, position, of, the, tongue, in, front, vowels, such, as, the, frequency, of, f2, is, relatively, high, which, generally, corresponds, to, a, position, of, the, tongue, forward, in, the, mouth, whereas, in, back, vowels, such, as, f2, is, low, consistent, with, the, tongue, being, positioned, towards, the, back, of, the, mouth, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, defines, five, degrees, of, vowel, backness, to, them, may, be, added, front, central, and, back, central, corresponding, to, the, vertical, lines, separating, central, from, front, and, back, vowel, spaces, in, several, ipa, diagrams, however, front, central, and, back, central, may, also, be, used, as, terms, synonymous, with, near, front, and, near, back, no, language, is, known, to, contrast, more, than, three, degrees, of, backness, nor, is, there, a, language, that, contrasts, front, with, near, front, vowels, nor, back, with, near, back, ones, although, some, english, dialects, have, vowels, at, five, degrees, of, backness, there, is, no, known, language, that, distinguishes, five, degrees, of, backness, without, additional, differences, in, height, or, rounding, roundedness, is, named, after, the, rounding, of, the, lips, in, some, vowels, because, lip, rounding, is, easily, visible, vowels, may, be, commonly, identified, as, rounded, based, on, the, articulation, of, the, lips, acoustically, rounded, vowels, are, identified, chiefly, by, a, decrease, in, f2, although, f1, is, also, slightly, decreased, in, most, languages, roundedness, is, a, reinforcing, feature, of, mid, to, high, back, vowels, rather, than, a, distinctive, feature, usually, the, higher, a, back, vowel, the, more, intense, is, the, rounding, however, in, some, languages, roundedness, is, independent, from, backness, such, as, french, and, german, with, front, rounded, vowels, most, uralic, languages, estonian, has, a, rounding, contrast, for, o, and, front, vowels, turkic, languages, with, a, rounding, distinction, for, front, vowels, and, u, and, vietnamese, with, back, unrounded, vowels, nonetheless, even, in, those, languages, there, is, usually, some, phonetic, correlation, between, rounding, and, backness, front, rounded, vowels, tend, to, be, more, front, central, than, front, and, back, unrounded, vowels, tend, to, be, more, back, central, than, back, thus, the, placement, of, unrounded, vowels, to, the, left, of, rounded, vowels, on, the, ipa, vowel, chart, is, reflective, of, their, position, in, formant, space, different, kinds, of, labialization, are, possible, in, mid, to, high, rounded, back, vowels, the, lips, are, generally, protruded, pursed, outward, a, phenomenon, known, as, endolabial, rounding, because, the, insides, of, the, lips, are, visible, whereas, in, mid, to, high, rounded, front, vowels, the, lips, are, generally, compressed, with, the, margins, of, the, lips, pulled, in, and, drawn, towards, each, other, a, phenomenon, known, as, exolabial, rounding, however, not, all, languages, follow, that, pattern, japanese, u, for, example, is, an, exolabial, compressed, back, vowel, and, sounds, quite, different, from, an, english, endolabial, u, swedish, and, norwegian, are, the, only, two, known, languages, in, which, the, feature, is, contrastive, they, have, both, exo, and, endo, labial, close, front, vowels, and, close, central, vowels, respectively, in, many, phonetic, treatments, both, are, considered, types, of, rounding, but, some, phoneticians, do, not, believe, that, these, are, subsets, of, a, single, phenomenon, and, posit, instead, three, independent, features, of, rounded, endolabial, compressed, exolabial, and, unrounded, the, lip, position, of, unrounded, vowels, may, also, be, classified, separately, as, spread, and, neutral, neither, rounded, nor, spread, others, distinguish, compressed, rounded, vowels, in, which, the, corners, of, the, mouth, are, drawn, together, from, compressed, unrounded, vowels, in, which, the, lips, are, compressed, but, the, corners, remain, apart, as, in, spread, vowels, the, conception, of, the, tongue, moving, in, two, directions, high, low, and, front, back, is, not, supported, by, articulatory, evidence, and, does, not, clarify, how, articulation, affects, vowel, quality, vowels, may, instead, be, characterized, by, the, three, directions, of, movement, of, the, tongue, from, its, neutral, position, front, forward, raised, upward, and, back, and, retracted, downward, and, back, front, vowels, and, to, a, lesser, extent, etc, can, be, secondarily, qualified, as, close, or, open, as, in, the, traditional, conception, but, this, refers, to, jaw, rather, than, tongue, position, in, addition, rather, than, there, being, a, unitary, category, of, back, vowels, the, regrouping, posits, raised, vowels, where, the, body, of, the, tongue, approaches, the, velum, etc, and, retracted, vowels, where, the, root, of, the, tongue, approaches, the, pharynx, etc, membership, in, these, categories, is, scalar, with, the, mid, central, vowels, being, marginal, to, any, category, nasalization, occurs, when, air, escapes, through, the, nose, vowels, are, often, nasalised, under, the, influence, of, neighbouring, nasal, consonants, as, in, english, hand, nasalised, vowels, however, should, not, be, confused, with, nasal, vowels, the, latter, refers, to, vowels, that, are, distinct, from, their, oral, counterparts, as, in, french, vs, in, nasal, vowels, the, velum, is, lowered, and, some, air, travels, through, the, nasal, cavity, as, well, as, the, mouth, an, oral, vowel, is, a, vowel, in, which, all, air, escapes, through, the, mouth, polish, and, portuguese, also, contrast, nasal, and, oral, vowels, voicing, describes, whether, the, vocal, cords, are, vibrating, during, the, articulation, of, a, vowel, most, languages, have, only, voiced, vowels, but, several, native, american, languages, such, as, cheyenne, and, totonac, have, both, voiced, and, devoiced, vowels, in, complementary, distribution, vowels, are, devoiced, in, whispered, speech, in, japanese, and, in, quebec, french, vowels, that, are, between, voiceless, consonants, are, often, devoiced, keres, is, dispuited, to, have, phonemic, voiceless, vowels, but, no, language, is, confirmed, to, have, them, phonemically, modal, voice, creaky, voice, and, breathy, voice, murmured, vowels, are, phonation, types, that, are, used, contrastively, in, some, languages, often, they, co, occur, with, tone, or, stress, distinctions, in, the, mon, language, vowels, pronounced, in, the, high, tone, are, also, produced, with, creaky, voice, in, such, cases, it, can, be, unclear, whether, it, is, the, tone, the, voicing, type, or, the, pairing, of, the, two, that, is, being, used, for, phonemic, contrast, the, combination, of, phonetic, cues, phonation, tone, stress, is, known, as, register, or, register, complex, tenseness, is, used, to, describe, the, opposition, of, tense, vowels, vs, lax, vowels, this, opposition, has, traditionally, been, thought, to, be, a, result, of, greater, muscular, tension, though, phonetic, experiments, have, repeatedly, failed, to, show, this, unlike, the, other, features, of, vowel, quality, tenseness, is, only, applicable, to, the, few, languages, that, have, this, opposition, mainly, germanic, languages, e, g, english, whereas, the, vowels, of, the, other, languages, e, g, spanish, cannot, be, described, with, respect, to, tenseness, in, any, meaningful, way, one, may, distinguish, the, english, tense, vs, lax, vowels, roughly, with, its, spelling, tense, vowels, usually, occur, in, words, with, the, final, silent, e, as, in, mate, lax, vowels, occur, in, words, without, the, silent, e, such, as, mat, in, american, english, lax, vowels, do, not, appear, in, stressed, open, syllables, in, traditional, grammar, long, vowels, vs, short, vowels, are, more, commonly, used, compared, to, tense, and, lax, the, two, sets, of, terms, are, used, interchangeably, by, some, because, the, features, are, concomitant, in, some, varieties, of, english, in, most, germanic, languages, lax, vowels, can, only, occur, in, closed, syllables, therefore, they, are, also, known, as, checked, vowels, whereas, the, tense, vowels, are, called, free, vowels, since, they, can, occur, in, any, kind, of, syllable, advanced, tongue, root, atr, is, a, feature, common, across, much, of, africa, the, pacific, northwest, and, scattered, other, languages, such, as, modern, mongolian, the, contrast, between, advanced, and, retracted, tongue, root, resembles, the, tense, lax, contrast, acoustically, but, they, are, articulated, differently, those, vowels, involve, noticeable, tension, in, the, vocal, tract, pharyngealized, vowels, occur, in, some, languages, like, sedang, and, the, tungusic, languages, pharyngealisation, is, similar, in, articulation, to, retracted, tongue, root, but, is, acoustically, distinct, a, stronger, degree, of, pharyngealisation, occurs, in, the, northeast, caucasian, languages, and, the, khoisan, languages, they, might, be, called, epiglottalized, since, the, primary, constriction, is, at, the, tip, of, the, epiglottis, the, greatest, degree, of, pharyngealisation, is, found, in, the, strident, vowels, of, the, khoisan, languages, where, the, larynx, is, raised, and, the, pharynx, constricted, so, that, either, the, epiglottis, or, the, arytenoid, cartilages, vibrate, instead, of, the, vocal, cords, the, terms, pharyngealized, epiglottalized, strident, and, sphincteric, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, rhotic, vowels, are, the, r, colored, vowels, of, american, english, and, a, few, other, languages, some, languages, such, as, english, and, russian, have, what, are, called, reduced, weak, or, obscure, vowels, in, some, unstressed, positions, these, do, not, correspond, one, to, one, with, the, vowel, sounds, that, occur, in, stressed, position, so, called, full, vowels, and, they, tend, to, be, mid, centralized, in, comparison, as, well, as, having, reduced, rounding, or, spreading, the, ipa, has, long, provided, two, letters, for, obscure, vowels, mid, and, lower, neither, of, which, are, defined, for, rounding, dialects, of, english, may, have, up, to, four, phonemic, reduced, vowels, and, higher, unrounded, and, rounded, the, non, ipa, letters, and, may, be, used, for, the, latter, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, clearly, defined, values, of, ipa, letters, like, and, which, are, also, seen, since, the, ipa, only, provides, for, two, reduced, vowels, the, acoustics, of, vowels, are, fairly, well, understood, the, different, vowel, qualities, are, realized, in, acoustic, analyses, of, vowels, by, the, relative, values, of, the, formants, acoustic, resonances, of, the, vocal, tract, which, show, up, as, dark, bands, on, a, spectrogram, the, vocal, tract, acts, as, a, resonant, cavity, and, the, position, of, the, jaw, lips, and, tongue, affect, the, parameters, of, the, resonant, cavity, resulting, in, different, formant, values, the, acoustics, of, vowels, can, be, visualized, using, spectrograms, which, display, the, acoustic, energy, at, each, frequency, and, how, this, changes, with, time, the, first, formant, abbreviated, f1, corresponds, to, vowel, openness, vowel, height, open, vowels, have, high, f1, frequencies, while, close, vowels, have, low, f1, frequencies, as, can, be, seen, in, the, accompanying, spectrogram, the, and, have, similar, low, first, formants, whereas, has, a, higher, formant, the, second, formant, f2, corresponds, to, vowel, frontness, back, vowels, have, low, f2, frequencies, while, front, vowels, have, high, f2, frequencies, this, is, very, clear, in, the, spectrogram, where, the, front, vowel, has, a, much, higher, f2, frequency, than, the, other, two, vowels, however, in, open, vowels, the, high, f1, frequency, forces, a, rise, in, the, f2, frequency, as, well, so, an, alternative, measure, of, frontness, is, the, difference, between, the, first, and, second, formants, for, this, reason, some, people, prefer, to, plot, as, f1, vs, f2, f1, this, dimension, is, usually, called, backness, rather, than, frontness, but, the, term, backness, can, be, counterintuitive, when, discussing, formants, in, the, third, edition, of, his, textbook, peter, ladefoged, recommended, using, plots, of, f1, against, f2, f1, to, represent, vowel, quality, however, in, the, fourth, edition, he, changed, to, adopt, a, simple, plot, of, f1, against, f2, and, this, simple, plot, of, f1, against, f2, was, maintained, for, the, fifth, and, final, edition, of, the, book, katrina, hayward, compares, the, two, types, of, plots, and, concludes, that, plotting, of, f1, against, f2, f1, is, not, very, satisfactory, because, of, its, effect, on, the, placing, of, the, central, vowels, so, she, also, recommends, use, of, a, simple, plot, of, f1, against, f2, in, fact, this, kind, of, plot, of, f1, against, f2, has, been, used, by, analysts, to, show, the, quality, of, the, vowels, in, a, wide, range, of, languages, including, rp, the, queen, s, english, american, english, singapore, english, brunei, english, north, frisian, turkish, kabardian, and, various, indigenous, australian, languages, r, colored, vowels, are, characterized, by, lowered, f3, values, rounding, is, generally, realized, by, a, decrease, of, f2, that, tends, to, reinforce, vowel, backness, one, effect, of, this, is, that, back, vowels, are, most, commonly, rounded, while, front, vowels, are, most, commonly, unrounded, another, is, that, rounded, vowels, tend, to, plot, to, the, right, of, unrounded, vowels, in, vowel, charts, that, is, there, is, a, reason, for, plotting, vowel, pairs, the, way, they, are, in, addition, to, variation, in, vowel, quality, as, described, above, vowels, vary, as, a, result, of, differences, in, prosody, the, most, important, prosodic, variables, are, pitch, fundamental, frequency, loudness, intensity, and, length, duration, however, the, features, of, prosody, are, usually, considered, to, apply, not, to, the, vowel, itself, but, to, the, syllable, in, which, the, vowel, occurs, in, other, words, the, domain, of, prosody, is, the, syllable, not, the, segment, vowel, or, consonant, we, can, list, briefly, the, effect, of, prosody, on, the, vowel, component, of, a, syllable, a, vowel, sound, whose, quality, does, not, change, throughout, the, vowel, is, called, a, monophthong, monophthongs, are, sometimes, called, pure, or, stable, vowels, a, vowel, sound, that, glides, from, one, quality, to, another, is, called, a, diphthong, and, a, vowel, sound, that, glides, successively, through, three, qualities, is, a, triphthong, all, languages, have, monophthongs, and, many, languages, have, diphthongs, but, triphthongs, or, vowel, sounds, with, even, more, target, qualities, are, relatively, rare, cross, linguistically, english, has, all, three, types, the, vowel, sound, in, hit, is, a, monophthong, the, vowel, sound, in, boy, is, in, most, dialects, a, diphthong, and, the, vowel, sounds, of, flower, a, r, form, a, triphthong, or, disyllable, depending, on, the, dialect, in, phonology, diphthongs, and, triphthongs, are, distinguished, from, sequences, of, monophthongs, by, whether, the, vowel, sound, may, be, analyzed, into, distinct, phonemes, for, example, the, vowel, sounds, in, a, two, syllable, pronunciation, of, the, word, flower, fla, r, phonetically, form, a, disyllabic, triphthong, but, are, phonologically, a, sequence, of, a, diphthong, represented, by, the, letters, ow, and, a, monophthong, represented, by, the, letters, er, some, linguists, use, the, terms, diphthong, and, triphthong, only, in, this, phonemic, sense, the, name, vowel, is, often, used, for, the, symbols, that, represent, vowel, sounds, in, a, language, s, writing, system, particularly, if, the, language, uses, an, alphabet, in, writing, systems, based, on, the, latin, alphabet, the, letters, a, e, i, o, u, y, w, and, sometimes, others, can, all, be, used, to, represent, vowels, however, not, all, of, these, letters, represent, the, vowels, in, all, languages, that, use, this, writing, or, even, consistently, within, one, language, some, of, them, especially, w, and, y, are, also, used, to, represent, approximant, consonants, moreover, a, vowel, might, be, represented, by, a, letter, usually, reserved, for, consonants, or, a, combination, of, letters, particularly, where, one, letter, represents, several, sounds, at, once, or, vice, versa, examples, from, english, include, igh, in, thigh, and, x, in, x, ray, in, addition, extensions, of, the, latin, alphabet, have, such, independent, vowel, letters, as, and, the, phonetic, values, vary, considerably, by, language, and, some, languages, use, i, and, y, for, the, consonant, e, g, initial, i, in, italian, or, romanian, and, initial, y, in, english, in, the, original, latin, alphabet, there, was, no, written, distinction, between, v, and, u, and, the, letter, represented, the, approximant, and, the, vowels, and, in, modern, welsh, w, represents, these, same, sounds, there, is, not, necessarily, a, direct, one, to, one, correspondence, between, the, vowel, sounds, of, a, language, and, the, vowel, letters, many, languages, that, use, a, form, of, the, latin, alphabet, have, more, vowel, sounds, than, can, be, represented, by, the, standard, set, of, five, vowel, letters, in, english, spelling, the, five, letters, a, e, i, o, and, u, can, represent, a, variety, of, vowel, sounds, while, the, letter, y, frequently, represents, vowels, as, in, e, g, g, y, m, happ, y, or, the, diphthongs, in, cr, y, th, y, me, w, is, used, in, representing, some, diphthongs, as, in, co, w, and, to, represent, a, monophthong, in, the, borrowed, words, cwm, and, crwth, sometimes, cruth, other, languages, cope, with, the, limitation, in, the, number, of, latin, vowel, letters, in, similar, ways, many, languages, make, extensive, use, of, combinations, of, letters, to, represent, various, sounds, other, languages, use, vowel, letters, with, modifications, such, as, in, swedish, or, add, diacritical, marks, like, umlauts, to, vowels, to, represent, the, variety, of, possible, vowel, sounds, some, languages, have, also, constructed, additional, vowel, letters, by, modifying, the, standard, latin, vowels, in, other, ways, such, as, or, that, are, found, in, some, of, the, scandinavian, languages, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, has, a, set, of, 28, symbols, representing, the, range, of, essential, vowel, qualities, and, a, further, set, of, diacritics, to, denote, variations, from, the, basic, vowel, the, writing, systems, used, for, some, languages, such, as, the, hebrew, alphabet, and, the, arabic, alphabet, do, not, ordinarily, mark, all, the, vowels, since, they, are, frequently, unnecessary, in, identifying, a, word, technically, these, are, called, abjads, rather, than, alphabets, although, it, is, possible, to, construct, english, sentences, that, can, be, understood, without, written, vowels, cn, y, rd, ths, single, words, in, english, lacking, written, vowels, can, be, indistinguishable, consider, dd, which, could, be, any, of, dad, dada, dado, dead, deed, did, died, diode, dodo, dud, dude, odd, add, and, aided, abjads, generally, express, some, word, internal, vowels, and, all, word, initial, and, word, final, vowels, whereby, the, ambiguity, will, be, much, reduced, the, masoretes, devised, a, vowel, notation, system, for, hebrew, jewish, scripture, that, is, still, widely, used, as, well, as, the, trope, symbols, used, for, its, cantillation, both, are, part, of, oral, tradition, and, still, the, basis, for, many, bible, translations, jewish, and, christian, the, differences, in, pronunciation, of, vowel, letters, between, english, and, its, related, languages, can, be, accounted, for, by, the, great, vowel, shift, after, printing, was, introduced, to, england, and, therefore, after, spelling, was, more, or, less, standardized, a, series, of, dramatic, changes, in, the, pronunciation, of, the, vowel, phonemes, occurred, and, continued, into, recent, centuries, but, were, not, reflected, in, the, spelling, system, this, has, led, to, numerous, inconsistencies, in, the, spelling, of, english, vowel, sounds, and, the, pronunciation, of, english, vowel, letters, and, to, the, mispronunciation, of, foreign, words, and, names, by, speakers, of, english, legend, unrounded, rounded, the, importance, of, vowels, in, distinguishing, one, word, from, another, varies, from, language, to, language, nearly, all, languages, have, at, least, three, phonemic, vowels, usually, i, a, u, as, in, classical, arabic, and, inuktitut, though, adyghe, and, many, sepik, languages, have, a, vertical, vowel, system, of, a, very, few, languages, have, fewer, though, some, arrernte, circassian, and, ndu, languages, have, been, argued, to, have, just, two, and, a, with, being, epenthetic, it, is, not, straightforward, to, say, which, language, has, the, most, vowels, since, that, depends, on, how, they, are, counted, for, example, long, vowels, nasal, vowels, and, various, phonations, may, or, may, not, be, counted, separately, indeed, it, may, sometimes, be, unclear, if, phonation, belongs, to, the, vowels, or, the, consonants, of, a, language, if, such, things, are, ignored, and, only, vowels, with, dedicated, ipa, letters, vowel, qualities, are, considered, then, very, few, languages, have, more, than, ten, the, germanic, languages, have, some, of, the, largest, inventories, standard, danish, has, 11, to, 13, short, vowels, a, e, i, o, u, y, while, the, amstetten, dialect, of, bavarian, has, been, reported, to, have, thirteen, long, vowels, i, y, e, a, o, u, the, situation, can, be, quite, disparate, within, a, same, family, language, spanish, and, french, are, two, closely, related, romance, languages, but, spanish, has, only, five, pure, vowel, qualities, a, e, i, o, u, while, classical, french, has, eleven, a, e, i, o, u, y, and, four, nasal, vowels, and, the, mon, khmer, languages, of, southeast, asia, also, have, some, large, inventories, such, as, the, eleven, vowels, of, vietnamese, i, e, a, o, u, wu, dialects, have, the, largest, inventories, of, chinese, the, jinhui, dialect, of, wu, has, also, been, reported, to, have, eleven, vowels, ten, basic, vowels, i, y, e, o, u, plus, restricted, this, does, not, count, the, seven, nasal, vowels, one, of, the, most, common, vowels, is, it, is, nearly, universal, for, a, language, to, have, at, least, one, open, vowel, though, most, dialects, of, english, have, an, and, a, and, often, an, all, open, vowels, but, no, central, some, tagalog, and, cebuano, speakers, have, rather, than, and, dhangu, yolngu, is, described, as, having, without, any, peripheral, vowels, is, also, extremely, common, though, tehuelche, has, just, the, vowels, e, a, o, with, no, close, vowels, the, third, vowel, of, the, arabic, type, three, vowel, system, u, is, considerably, less, common, a, large, fraction, of, the, languages, of, north, america, happen, to, have, a, four, vowel, system, without, u, i, e, a, o, nahuatl, and, navajo, are, examples, in, most, languages, vowels, serve, mainly, to, distinguish, separate, lexemes, rather, than, different, inflectional, forms, of, the, same, lexeme, as, they, commonly, do, in, the, semitic, languages, for, example, while, english, man, becomes, men, in, the, plural, moon, is, a, completely, different, word, in, rhotic, dialects, of, english, as, in, canada, and, the, united, states, there, are, many, words, such, as, bird, learn, girl, church, worst, worm, myrrh, that, some, phoneticians, analyze, as, having, no, vowels, only, a, syllabic, consonant, however, others, analyze, these, words, instead, as, having, a, rhotic, vowel, the, difference, may, be, partially, one, of, dialect, there, are, a, few, such, words, that, are, disyllabic, like, cursor, curtain, and, turtle, and, or, and, and, even, a, few, that, are, trisyllabic, at, least, in, some, accents, such, as, purpler, hurdler, gurgler, and, certainer, the, word, and, frequently, contracts, to, a, simple, nasal, n, as, in, lock, n, key, words, such, as, will, have, and, is, regularly, contract, to, ll, ve, and, s, however, none, of, them, are, pronounced, alone, without, vowels, so, they, are, not, phonological, words, onomatopoeic, words, that, can, be, pronounced, alone, and, that, have, no, vowels, or, ars, include, hmm, pst, shh, tsk, and, zzz, as, in, other, languages, onomatopoeiae, stand, outside, the, normal, phonotactics, of, english, there, are, other, languages, that, form, lexical, words, without, vowel, sounds, in, serbo, croatian, for, example, the, consonants, and, the, difference, is, not, written, can, act, as, a, syllable, nucleus, and, carry, rising, or, falling, tone, examples, include, the, tongue, twister, na, vrh, brda, vrba, mrda, and, geographic, names, such, as, krk, in, czech, and, slovak, either, or, can, stand, in, for, vowels, vlk, wolf, krk, neck, a, particularly, long, word, without, vowels, is, tvrthrst, meaning, quarter, handful, with, two, syllables, one, for, each, r, or, scvrnkls, a, verb, form, meaning, you, flipped, sth, down, eg, a, marble, whole, sentences, usually, tongue, twisters, can, be, made, from, such, words, such, as, str, prst, skrz, krk, meaning, stick, a, finger, through, your, neck, pronounced, and, smr, pln, skvrn, zvlhl, z, mlh, here, zvlhl, has, two, syllables, based, on, l, and, the, preposition, z, consists, of, a, single, consonant, only, prepositions, do, this, in, czech, and, they, normally, link, phonetically, to, the, following, word, so, not, really, behave, as, vowelless, words, in, russian, there, are, also, prepositions, that, consist, of, a, single, consonant, letter, like, k, to, v, in, and, s, with, however, these, forms, are, actually, contractions, of, ko, vo, and, so, respectively, and, these, forms, are, still, used, in, modern, russian, before, words, with, certain, consonant, clusters, for, ease, of, pronunciation, in, kazakh, and, certain, other, turkic, languages, words, without, vowel, sounds, may, occur, due, to, reduction, of, weak, vowels, a, common, example, is, the, kazakh, word, for, one, bir, pronounced, among, careful, speakers, however, the, original, vowel, may, be, preserved, and, the, vowels, are, always, preserved, in, the, orthography, in, southern, varieties, of, chinese, such, as, cantonese, and, minnan, some, monosyllabic, words, are, made, of, exclusively, nasals, such, as, cantonese, no, and, five, minnan, also, has, words, consisting, of, a, consonant, followed, by, a, syllabic, nasal, such, as, pn, g, cooked, rice, so, far, all, of, these, syllabic, consonants, at, least, in, the, lexical, words, have, been, sonorants, such, as, and, which, have, a, voiced, quality, similar, to, vowels, they, can, carry, tone, for, example, however, there, are, languages, with, lexical, words, that, not, only, contain, no, vowels, but, contain, no, sonorants, at, all, like, non, lexical, shh, in, english, these, include, some, berber, languages, and, some, languages, of, the, american, pacific, northwest, such, as, nuxalk, an, example, from, the, latter, is, scs, seal, fat, pronounced, as, spelled, and, a, longer, one, is, clhp, xwlhtlhplhhskwts, pronounced, he, had, had, in, his, possession, a, bunchberry, plant, follow, the, nuxalk, link, for, other, examples, berber, examples, include, tkkststt, you, took, it, off, and, tfktstt, you, gave, it, some, words, may, contain, one, or, two, consonants, only, be, ks, feed, on, in, mandarin, chinese, words, and, syllables, such, as, s, and, zh, are, sometimes, described, as, being, syllabic, fricatives, and, affricates, phonemically, and, t, but, these, do, have, a, voiced, segment, that, carries, the, tone, in, the, japonic, language, miyako, there, are, words, with, no, voiced, sounds, such, as, ss, dust, kss, breast, milk, pss, day, ff, a, comb, kff, to, make, fks, to, build, ksks, month, sks, to, cut, psks, to, pull, some, analyses, of, wandala, is, reported, to, have, no, phonemic, vowels, it, is, not, uncommon, for, short, grammatical, words, to, consist, of, only, vowels, such, as, a, and, i, in, english, lexical, words, are, somewhat, rarer, in, english, and, are, generally, restricted, to, a, single, syllable, eye, awe, owe, and, in, non, rhotic, accents, air, ore, err, vowel, only, words, of, more, than, one, syllable, are, generally, foreign, loans, such, as, ai, two, syllables, i, for, the, maned, sloth, or, proper, names, such, as, iowa, in, some, accents, a, o, however, vowel, sequences, in, hiatus, are, more, freely, allowed, in, some, other, languages, most, famously, perhaps, in, bantu, and, polynesian, languages, but, also, in, japanese, and, finnic, languages, in, such, languages, there, tends, to, be, a, larger, variety, of, vowel, only, words, in, swahili, bantu, for, example, there, is, aua, to, survey, and, eua, to, purify, both, three, syllables, in, japanese, aoi, blue, green, and, oioi, gradually, three, and, four, morae, and, in, finnish, aie, intention, and, auo, open, both, two, syllables, although, some, dialects, pronounce, them, as, aije, and, auvo, in, urdu, ye, aaie, or, yn, come, is, used, hawaiian, and, the, polynesian, languages, generally, have, unusually, large, numbers, of, such, words, such, as, ae, ea, a, small, green, fish, which, is, three, syllables, ae, e, a, most, long, words, involve, reduplication, which, is, quite, productive, in, polynesian, ioio, grooves, eaea, breath, uaua, tough, all, four, syllables, au, u, crying, five, syllables, from, u, uw, to, weep, uoa, or, uouoa, false, mullet, sp, fish, three, or, five, syllables,
