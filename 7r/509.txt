freedom, of, speech, is, a, principle, that, supports, the, freedom, of, an, individual, or, a, community, to, articulate, their, opinions, and, ideas, without, fear, of, retaliation, censorship, or, legal, sanction, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, has, been, recognised, as, a, human, right, in, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, and, international, human, rights, law, by, the, united, nations, many, countries, have, constitutional, law, that, protects, free, speech, terms, like, free, speech, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, expression, are, used, interchangeably, in, political, discourse, however, in, a, legal, sense, the, freedom, of, expression, includes, any, activity, of, seeking, receiving, and, imparting, information, or, ideas, regardless, of, the, medium, used, article, 19, of, the, udhr, states, that, everyone, shall, have, the, right, to, hold, opinions, without, interference, and, everyone, shall, have, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, this, right, shall, include, freedom, to, seek, receive, and, impart, information, and, ideas, of, all, kinds, regardless, of, frontiers, either, orally, in, writing, or, in, print, in, the, form, of, art, or, through, any, other, media, of, his, choice, the, version, of, article, 19, in, the, iccpr, later, amends, this, by, stating, that, the, exercise, of, these, rights, carries, special, duties, and, responsibilities, and, may, therefore, be, subject, to, certain, restrictions, when, necessary, or, respect, of, the, rights, or, reputation, of, others, or, or, the, protection, of, national, security, or, of, public, order, ordre, public, or, of, public, health, or, morals, freedom, of, speech, and, expression, therefore, may, not, be, recognized, as, being, absolute, and, common, limitations, or, boundaries, to, freedom, of, speech, relate, to, libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting, words, hate, speech, classified, information, copyright, violation, trade, secrets, food, labeling, non, disclosure, agreements, the, right, to, privacy, dignity, the, right, to, be, forgotten, public, security, for, example, yelling, fire, in, a, crowded, movie, theater, where, no, fire, exists, blasphemy, and, perjury, justifications, for, such, include, the, harm, principle, proposed, by, john, stuart, mill, in, on, liberty, which, suggests, that, the, only, purpose, for, which, power, can, be, rightfully, exercised, over, any, member, of, a, civilized, community, against, his, will, is, to, prevent, harm, to, others, the, idea, of, the, offense, principle, is, also, used, to, justify, speech, limitations, describing, the, restriction, on, forms, of, expression, deemed, offensive, to, society, considering, factors, such, as, extent, duration, motives, of, the, speaker, and, ease, with, which, it, could, be, avoided, with, the, evolution, of, the, digital, age, application, of, freedom, of, speech, becomes, more, controversial, as, new, means, of, communication, and, restrictions, arise, for, example, the, golden, shield, project, an, initiative, by, chinese, government, s, ministry, of, public, security, that, filters, potentially, unfavourable, data, from, foreign, countries, facebook, routinely, and, automatically, eliminates, what, it, perceives, as, hate, speech, even, if, such, words, are, used, ironically, or, poetically, with, no, intent, to, insult, others, the, human, rights, measurement, initiative, measures, the, right, to, opinion, and, expression, for, countries, around, the, world, using, a, survey, of, in, country, human, rights, experts, freedom, of, speech, and, expression, has, a, long, history, that, predates, modern, international, human, rights, instruments, it, is, thought, that, the, ancient, athenian, democratic, principle, of, free, speech, may, have, emerged, in, the, late, 6th, or, early, 5th, century, bc, freedom, of, speech, was, vindicated, by, erasmus, and, milton, edward, coke, claimed, freedom, of, speech, as, an, ancient, custom, of, parliament, in, the, 1590s, and, it, was, affirmed, in, the, protestation, of, 1621, restating, what, is, written, in, the, english, declaration, of, right, 1689, england, s, bill, of, rights, 1689, legally, established, the, constitutional, right, of, freedom, of, speech, in, parliament, which, is, still, in, effect, this, so, called, parliamentary, privilege, includes, no, possible, defamation, claims, meaning, parliamentarians, are, free, to, speak, up, in, the, house, without, fear, of, legal, action, this, protection, extends, to, written, proceedings, for, example, written, and, oral, questions, motions, and, amendments, tabled, to, bills, and, motions, one, of, the, world, s, first, freedom, of, the, press, acts, was, introduced, in, sweden, in, 1766, swedish, freedom, of, the, press, act, mainly, due, to, the, classical, liberal, member, of, parliament, and, ostrobothnian, priest, anders, chydenius, in, a, report, published, in, 1776, he, wrote, no, evidence, should, be, needed, that, a, certain, freedom, of, writing, and, printing, is, one, of, the, strongest, bulwarks, of, a, free, organization, of, the, state, as, without, it, the, estates, would, not, have, sufficient, information, for, the, drafting, of, good, laws, and, those, dispensing, justice, would, not, be, monitored, nor, would, the, subjects, know, the, requirements, of, the, law, the, limits, of, the, rights, of, government, and, their, responsibilities, education, and, ethical, conduct, would, be, crushed, coarseness, in, thought, speech, and, manners, would, prevail, and, dimness, would, darken, the, entire, sky, of, our, freedom, in, a, few, years, under, the, leadership, of, anders, chydenius, the, caps, at, the, swedish, riksdag, in, g, vle, on, december, 2, 1766, passed, the, adoption, of, a, freedom, of, the, press, regulation, that, stopped, censorship, and, introduced, the, principle, of, public, access, to, official, records, in, sweden, excluded, were, defamation, of, the, king, s, majesty, and, the, swedish, church, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, adopted, during, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, specifically, affirmed, freedom, of, speech, as, an, inalienable, right, adopted, in, 1791, freedom, of, speech, is, a, feature, of, the, first, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, the, french, declaration, provides, for, freedom, of, expression, in, article, 11, which, states, that, the, free, communication, of, ideas, and, opinions, is, one, of, the, most, precious, of, the, rights, of, man, every, citizen, may, accordingly, speak, write, and, print, with, freedom, but, shall, be, responsible, for, such, abuses, of, this, freedom, as, shall, be, defined, by, law, article, 19, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, adopted, in, 1948, states, that, everyone, has, the, right, to, freedom, of, opinion, and, expression, this, right, includes, freedom, to, hold, opinions, without, interference, and, to, seek, receive, and, impart, information, and, ideas, through, any, media, and, regardless, of, frontiers, today, freedom, of, speech, or, the, freedom, of, expression, is, recognised, in, international, and, regional, human, rights, law, the, right, is, enshrined, in, article, 19, of, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, article, 10, of, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, article, 13, of, the, american, convention, on, human, rights, and, article, 9, of, the, african, charter, on, human, and, peoples, rights, based, on, john, milton, s, arguments, freedom, of, speech, is, understood, as, a, multi, faceted, right, that, includes, not, only, the, right, to, express, or, disseminate, information, and, ideas, but, three, further, distinct, aspects, international, regional, and, national, standards, also, recognise, that, freedom, of, speech, as, the, freedom, of, expression, includes, any, medium, whether, orally, in, writing, in, print, through, the, internet, or, art, forms, this, means, that, the, protection, of, freedom, of, speech, as, a, right, includes, the, content, and, the, means, of, expression, the, right, to, freedom, of, speech, and, expression, is, closely, related, to, other, rights, it, may, be, limited, when, conflicting, with, other, rights, see, limitations, on, freedom, of, speech, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, is, also, related, to, the, right, to, a, fair, trial, and, court, proceeding, which, may, limit, access, to, the, search, for, information, or, determine, the, opportunity, and, means, in, which, freedom, of, expression, is, manifested, within, court, proceedings, as, a, general, principle, freedom, of, expression, may, not, limit, the, right, to, privacy, as, well, as, the, honor, and, reputation, of, others, however, greater, latitude, is, given, when, criticism, of, public, figures, is, involved, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, is, particularly, important, for, media, which, play, a, special, role, as, the, bearer, of, the, general, right, to, freedom, of, expression, for, all, however, freedom, of, the, press, does, not, necessarily, enable, freedom, of, speech, judith, lichtenberg, has, outlined, conditions, in, which, freedom, of, the, press, may, constrain, freedom, of, speech, for, example, if, all, the, people, who, control, the, various, mediums, of, publication, suppress, information, or, stifle, the, diversity, of, voices, inherent, in, freedom, of, speech, this, limitation, was, famously, summarised, as, freedom, of, the, press, is, guaranteed, only, to, those, who, own, one, lichtenberg, argues, that, freedom, of, the, press, is, simply, a, form, of, property, right, summed, up, by, the, principle, no, money, no, voice, freedom, of, speech, is, usually, seen, as, a, negative, right, this, means, that, the, government, is, legally, obliged, to, take, no, action, against, the, speaker, based, on, the, speaker, s, views, but, that, no, one, is, obliged, to, help, any, speakers, publish, their, views, and, no, one, is, required, to, listen, to, agree, with, or, acknowledge, the, speaker, or, the, speaker, s, views, these, concepts, correspond, to, earlier, traditions, of, natural, law, and, common, law, rights, freedom, of, speech, is, understood, to, be, fundamental, in, a, democracy, the, norms, on, limiting, freedom, of, expression, mean, that, public, debate, may, not, be, completely, suppressed, even, in, times, of, emergency, one, of, the, most, notable, proponents, of, the, link, between, freedom, of, speech, and, democracy, is, alexander, meiklejohn, he, has, argued, that, the, concept, of, democracy, is, that, of, self, government, by, the, people, for, such, a, system, to, work, an, informed, electorate, is, necessary, in, order, to, be, appropriately, knowledgeable, there, must, be, no, constraints, on, the, free, flow, of, information, and, ideas, according, to, meiklejohn, democracy, will, not, be, true, to, its, essential, ideal, if, those, in, power, can, manipulate, the, electorate, by, withholding, information, and, stifling, criticism, meiklejohn, acknowledges, that, the, desire, to, manipulate, opinion, can, stem, from, the, motive, of, seeking, to, benefit, society, however, he, argues, choosing, manipulation, negates, in, its, means, the, democratic, ideal, eric, barendt, has, called, this, defence, of, free, speech, on, the, grounds, of, democracy, probably, the, most, attractive, and, certainly, the, most, fashionable, free, speech, theory, in, modern, western, democracies, thomas, i, emerson, expanded, on, this, defence, when, he, argued, that, freedom, of, speech, helps, to, provide, a, balance, between, stability, and, change, freedom, of, speech, acts, as, a, safety, valve, to, let, off, steam, when, people, might, otherwise, be, bent, on, revolution, he, argues, that, the, principle, of, open, discussion, is, a, method, of, achieving, a, more, adaptable, and, at, the, same, time, more, stable, community, of, maintaining, the, precarious, balance, between, healthy, cleavage, and, necessary, consensus, emerson, furthermore, maintains, that, opposition, serves, a, vital, social, function, in, offsetting, or, ameliorating, the, normal, process, of, bureaucratic, decay, research, undertaken, by, the, worldwide, governance, indicators, project, at, the, world, bank, indicates, that, freedom, of, speech, and, the, process, of, accountability, that, follows, it, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, quality, of, governance, of, a, country, voice, and, accountability, within, a, country, defined, as, the, extent, to, which, a, country, s, citizens, are, able, to, participate, in, selecting, their, government, as, well, as, freedom, of, expression, freedom, of, association, and, free, media, is, one, of, the, six, dimensions, of, governance, that, the, worldwide, governance, indicators, measure, for, more, than, 200, countries, against, this, backdrop, it, is, important, that, development, agencies, create, grounds, for, effective, support, for, a, free, press, in, developing, countries, richard, moon, has, developed, the, argument, that, the, value, of, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, expression, lies, with, social, interactions, moon, writes, that, by, communicating, an, individual, forms, relationships, and, associations, with, others, family, friends, co, workers, church, congregation, and, countrymen, by, entering, into, discussion, with, others, an, individual, participates, in, the, development, of, knowledge, and, in, the, direction, of, the, community, freedom, of, speech, is, not, regarded, as, absolute, by, some, with, most, legal, systems, generally, setting, limits, on, the, freedom, of, speech, particularly, when, freedom, of, speech, conflicts, with, other, rights, and, protections, such, as, in, the, cases, of, libel, slander, pornography, obscenity, fighting, words, and, intellectual, property, some, limitations, to, freedom, of, speech, may, occur, through, legal, sanction, and, others, may, occur, through, social, disapprobation, in, saudi, arabia, journalists, are, forbidden, to, write, with, disrespect, or, disapproval, of, the, royal, family, religion, or, the, government, journalists, are, also, not, given, any, legal, protection, for, their, writing, in, saudi, arabia, journalist, jamal, khashoggi, was, a, critic, of, the, saudi, arabian, government, he, was, killed, in, 2018, by, saudi, arabian, officials, for, his, writing, some, views, are, illegal, to, express, because, they, are, perceived, by, some, to, be, harmful, to, others, this, category, often, includes, speech, that, is, both, false, and, potentially, dangerous, such, as, falsely, shouting, fire, in, a, theatre, and, causing, a, panic, justifications, for, limitations, to, freedom, of, speech, often, reference, the, harm, principle, or, the, offence, principle, in, on, liberty, 1859, john, stuart, mill, argued, that, there, ought, to, exist, the, fullest, liberty, of, professing, and, discussing, as, a, matter, of, ethical, conviction, any, doctrine, however, immoral, it, may, be, considered, mill, argues, that, the, fullest, liberty, of, expression, is, required, to, push, arguments, to, their, logical, limits, rather, than, the, limits, of, social, embarrassment, in, 1985, joel, feinberg, introduced, what, is, known, as, the, offence, principle, feinberg, wrote, it, is, always, a, good, reason, in, support, of, a, proposed, criminal, prohibition, that, it, would, probably, be, an, effective, way, of, preventing, serious, offence, as, opposed, to, injury, or, harm, to, persons, other, than, the, actor, and, that, it, is, probably, a, necessary, means, to, that, end, hence, feinberg, argues, that, the, harm, principle, sets, the, bar, too, high, and, that, some, forms, of, expression, can, be, legitimately, prohibited, by, law, because, they, are, very, offensive, nevertheless, as, offending, someone, is, less, serious, than, harming, someone, the, penalties, imposed, should, be, higher, for, causing, harm, in, contrast, mill, does, not, support, legal, penalties, unless, they, are, based, on, the, harm, principle, because, the, degree, to, which, people, may, take, offence, varies, or, may, be, the, result, of, unjustified, prejudice, feinberg, suggests, that, several, factors, need, to, be, taken, into, account, when, applying, the, offence, principle, including, the, extent, duration, and, social, value, of, the, speech, the, ease, with, which, it, can, be, avoided, the, motives, of, the, speaker, the, number, of, people, offended, the, intensity, of, the, offence, and, the, general, interest, of, the, community, at, large, jasper, doomen, argued, that, harm, should, be, defined, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, individual, citizen, not, limiting, harm, to, physical, harm, since, nonphysical, harm, may, also, be, involved, feinberg, s, distinction, between, harm, and, offence, is, criticized, as, largely, trivial, in, 1999, bernard, harcourt, wrote, of, the, collapse, of, the, harm, principle, today, the, debate, is, characterized, by, a, cacophony, of, competing, harm, arguments, without, any, way, to, resolve, them, there, is, no, longer, an, argument, within, the, structure, of, the, debate, to, resolve, the, competing, claims, of, harm, the, original, harm, principle, was, never, equipped, to, determine, the, relative, importance, of, harms, interpretations, of, both, the, harm, and, offense, limitations, to, freedom, of, speech, are, culturally, and, politically, relative, for, instance, in, russia, the, harm, and, offense, principles, have, been, used, to, justify, the, russian, lgbt, propaganda, law, restricting, speech, and, action, concerning, lgbt, issues, many, european, countries, outlaw, speech, that, might, be, interpreted, as, holocaust, denial, these, include, austria, belgium, canada, the, czech, republic, france, germany, hungary, israel, liechtenstein, lithuania, luxembourg, the, netherlands, poland, portugal, russia, slovakia, switzerland, and, romania, armenian, genocide, denial, is, also, illegal, in, some, countries, in, some, countries, blasphemy, is, a, crime, for, example, in, austria, defaming, muhammad, the, prophet, of, islam, is, not, protected, as, free, speech, in, contrast, in, france, blasphemy, and, disparagement, of, muhammad, are, protected, under, free, speech, law, certain, public, institutions, may, also, enact, policies, restricting, the, freedom, of, speech, for, example, speech, codes, at, state, operated, schools, in, the, u, s, the, standing, landmark, opinion, on, political, speech, is, brandenburg, v, ohio, 1969, expressly, overruling, whitney, v, california, in, brandenburg, the, u, s, supreme, court, referred, to, the, right, even, to, speak, openly, of, violent, action, and, revolution, in, broad, terms, decisions, have, fashioned, the, principle, that, the, constitutional, guarantees, of, free, speech, and, free, press, do, not, allow, a, state, to, forbid, or, proscribe, advocacy, of, the, use, of, force, or, law, violation, except, where, such, advocacy, is, directed, to, inciting, or, producing, imminent, lawless, action, and, is, likely, to, incite, or, cause, such, action, the, opinion, in, brandenburg, discarded, the, previous, test, of, clear, and, present, danger, and, made, the, right, to, freedom, of, political, speech, protections, in, the, united, states, almost, absolute, hate, speech, is, also, protected, by, the, first, amendment, in, the, united, states, as, decided, in, r, a, v, v, city, of, st, paul, 1992, in, which, the, supreme, court, ruled, that, hate, speech, is, permissible, except, in, the, case, of, imminent, violence, see, the, first, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, for, more, detailed, information, on, this, decision, and, its, historical, background, limitations, based, on, time, place, and, manner, apply, to, all, speech, regardless, of, the, view, expressed, they, are, generally, restrictions, that, are, intended, to, balance, other, rights, or, a, legitimate, government, interest, for, example, a, time, place, and, manner, restriction, might, prohibit, a, noisy, political, demonstration, at, a, politician, s, home, during, the, middle, of, the, night, as, that, impinges, upon, the, rights, of, the, politician, s, neighbors, to, quiet, enjoyment, of, their, own, homes, an, otherwise, identical, activity, might, be, permitted, if, it, happened, at, a, different, time, e, g, during, the, day, at, a, different, place, e, g, at, a, government, building, or, in, another, public, forum, or, in, a, different, manner, e, g, a, silent, protest, funeral, protests, are, a, complex, issue, in, the, united, states, it, is, a, right, to, americans, to, be, able, to, hold, a, peaceful, protest, against, various, policies, they, deem, unreasonable, it, is, a, question, of, whether, or, not, it, is, appropriate, through, the, time, place, and, manner, outlook, to, protest, funeral, proceedings, because, of, recent, flare, ups, of, this, occurring, legislation, has, been, put, to, action, to, limit, this, now, funeral, protests, are, governed, and, prohibited, by, law, on, a, state, to, state, basis, inside, the, united, states, jo, glanville, editor, of, the, index, on, censorship, states, that, the, internet, has, been, a, revolution, for, censorship, as, much, as, for, free, speech, international, national, and, regional, standards, recognise, that, freedom, of, speech, as, one, form, of, freedom, of, expression, applies, to, any, medium, including, the, internet, the, communications, decency, act, cda, of, 1996, was, the, first, major, attempt, by, the, united, states, congress, to, regulate, pornographic, material, on, the, internet, in, 1997, in, the, landmark, cyberlaw, case, of, reno, v, aclu, the, us, supreme, court, partially, overturned, the, law, judge, stewart, r, dalzell, one, of, the, three, federal, judges, who, in, june, 1996, declared, parts, of, the, cda, unconstitutional, in, his, opinion, stated, the, following, the, internet, is, a, far, more, speech, enhancing, medium, than, print, the, village, green, or, the, mails, because, it, would, necessarily, affect, the, internet, itself, the, cda, would, necessarily, reduce, the, speech, available, for, adults, on, the, medium, this, is, a, constitutionally, intolerable, result, some, of, the, dialogue, on, the, internet, surely, tests, the, limits, of, conventional, discourse, speech, on, the, internet, can, be, unfiltered, unpolished, and, unconventional, even, emotionally, charged, sexually, explicit, and, vulgar, in, a, word, indecent, in, many, communities, but, we, should, expect, such, speech, to, occur, in, a, medium, in, which, citizens, from, all, walks, of, life, have, a, voice, we, should, also, protect, the, autonomy, that, such, a, medium, confers, to, ordinary, people, as, well, as, media, magnates, my, analysis, does, not, deprive, the, government, of, all, means, of, protecting, children, from, the, dangers, of, internet, communication, the, government, can, continue, to, protect, children, from, pornography, on, the, internet, through, vigorous, enforcement, of, existing, laws, criminalising, obscenity, and, child, pornography, as, we, learned, at, the, hearing, there, is, also, a, compelling, need, for, public, educations, about, the, benefits, and, dangers, of, this, new, medium, and, the, government, can, fill, that, role, as, well, in, my, view, our, action, today, should, only, mean, that, government, s, permissible, supervision, of, internet, contents, stops, at, the, traditional, line, of, unprotected, speech, the, absence, of, governmental, regulation, of, internet, content, has, unquestionably, produced, a, kind, of, chaos, but, as, one, of, the, plaintiff, s, experts, put, it, with, such, resonance, at, the, hearing, what, achieved, success, was, the, very, chaos, that, the, internet, is, the, strength, of, the, internet, is, chaos, just, as, the, strength, of, the, internet, is, chaos, so, that, strength, of, our, liberty, depends, upon, the, chaos, and, cacophony, of, the, unfettered, speech, the, first, amendment, protects, the, world, summit, on, the, information, society, wsis, declaration, of, principles, adopted, in, 2003, makes, specific, reference, to, the, importance, of, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, for, the, information, society, in, stating, we, reaffirm, as, an, essential, foundation, of, the, information, society, and, as, outlined, in, article, 19, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, that, everyone, has, the, right, to, freedom, of, opinion, and, expression, that, this, right, includes, freedom, to, hold, opinions, without, interference, and, to, seek, receive, and, impart, information, and, ideas, through, any, media, and, regardless, of, frontiers, communication, is, a, fundamental, social, process, a, basic, human, need, and, the, foundation, of, all, social, organisation, it, is, central, to, the, information, society, everyone, everywhere, should, have, the, opportunity, to, participate, and, no, one, should, be, excluded, from, the, benefits, of, the, information, society, offers, according, to, bernt, hugenholtz, and, lucie, guibault, the, public, domain, is, under, pressure, from, the, commodification, of, information, as, information, with, previously, little, or, no, economic, value, has, acquired, independent, economic, value, in, the, information, age, this, includes, factual, data, personal, data, genetic, information, and, pure, ideas, the, commodification, of, information, is, taking, place, through, intellectual, property, law, contract, law, as, well, as, broadcasting, and, telecommunications, law, freedom, of, information, is, an, extension, of, freedom, of, speech, where, the, medium, of, expression, is, the, internet, freedom, of, information, may, also, refer, to, the, right, to, privacy, in, the, context, of, the, internet, and, information, technology, as, with, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, the, right, to, privacy, is, a, recognised, human, right, and, freedom, of, information, acts, as, an, extension, to, this, right, freedom, of, information, may, also, concern, censorship, in, an, information, technology, context, i, e, the, ability, to,

claims, to, remove, blocks, to, the, free, flow, of, information, for, what, they, term, closed, societies, according, to, the, reporters, without, borders, rwb, internet, enemy, list, the, following, states, engage, in, pervasive, internet, censorship, mainland, china, cuba, iran, myanmar, burma, north, korea, saudi, arabia, syria, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, and, vietnam, a, widely, publicized, example, of, internet, censorship, is, the, great, firewall, of, china, in, reference, both, to, its, role, as, a, network, firewall, and, the, ancient, great, wall, of, china, the, system, blocks, content, by, preventing, ip, addresses, from, being, routed, through, and, consists, of, standard, firewall, and, proxy, servers, at, the, internet, gateways, the, system, also, selectively, engages, in, dns, poisoning, when, particular, sites, are, requested, the, government, does, not, appear, to, be, systematically, examining, internet, content, as, this, appears, to, be, technically, impractical, internet, censorship, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, is, conducted, under, a, wide, variety, of, laws, and, administrative, regulations, including, more, than, sixty, regulations, directed, at, the, internet, censorship, systems, are, vigorously, implemented, by, provincial, branches, of, state, owned, isps, business, companies, and, organizations, saudi, arabia, s, government, had, been, intensifying, the, scrutiny, of, social, media, accounts, under, which, they, were, detaining, several, activists, critics, and, even, normal, social, media, users, over, few, critical, tweets, a, law, professor, awad, al, qarni, became, a, victim, of, saudi, s, internet, censorship, and, was, facing, death, sentence, saudi, controlled, media, portrayed, him, as, a, dangerous, preacher, due, to, his, twitter, and, whatsapp, posts, but, dissidents, considered, him, as, an, important, intellectual, who, maintained, strong, social, media, influence, some, legal, scholars, such, as, tim, wu, of, columbia, university, have, argued, that, the, traditional, issues, of, free, speech, that, the, main, threat, to, free, speech, is, the, censorship, of, suppressive, states, and, that, ill, informed, or, malevolent, speech, can, and, should, be, overcome, by, more, and, better, speech, rather, than, censorship, assumes, scarcity, of, information, this, scarcity, prevailed, during, the, 20th, century, but, with, the, arrival, of, the, internet, information, became, plentiful, but, the, attention, of, listeners, scarce, furthermore, in, the, words, of, wu, this, cheap, speech, made, possible, by, the, internet, may, be, used, to, attack, harass, and, silence, as, much, as, it, is, used, to, illuminate, or, debate, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, eff, has, argued, that, censorship, cannot, be, the, only, answer, to, disinformation, online, and, that, tech, companies, have, a, history, of, overcorrecting, and, censoring, accurate, useful, speech, or, even, worse, reinforcing, misinformation, with, their, policies, according, to, wu, in, the, 21st, century, the, danger, is, not, suppressive, states, that, target, speakers, directly, but, that, targets, listeners, or, it, undermines, speakers, indirectly, more, precisely, emerging, techniques, of, speech, control, depend, on, 1, a, range, of, new, punishments, like, unleashing, troll, armies, to, abuse, the, press, and, other, critics, and, 2, flooding, tactics, sometimes, called, reverse, censorship, that, distort, or, drown, out, disfavored, speech, through, the, creation, and, dissemination, of, fake, news, the, payment, of, fake, commentators, and, the, deployment, of, propaganda, robots, as, journalist, peter, pomerantsev, writes, these, techniques, employ, information, in, weaponized, terms, as, a, tool, to, confuse, blackmail, demoralize, subvert, and, paralyze, before, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, a, written, work, once, created, could, only, be, physically, multiplied, by, highly, laborious, and, error, prone, manual, copying, no, elaborate, system, of, censorship, and, control, over, scribes, existed, who, until, the, 14th, century, were, restricted, to, religious, institutions, and, their, works, rarely, caused, wider, controversy, in, response, to, the, printing, press, and, the, theological, heresies, it, allowed, to, spread, the, roman, catholic, church, moved, to, impose, censorship, printing, allowed, for, multiple, exact, copies, of, a, work, leading, to, a, more, rapid, and, widespread, circulation, of, ideas, and, information, see, print, culture, the, origins, of, copyright, law, in, most, european, countries, lie, in, efforts, by, the, roman, catholic, church, and, governments, to, regulate, and, control, the, output, of, printers, in, 1501, pope, alexander, vi, issued, a, bill, against, the, unlicensed, printing, of, books, in, 1559, pope, paul, iv, promulgated, the, index, expurgatorius, or, list, of, prohibited, books, the, index, expurgatorius, is, the, most, famous, and, long, lasting, example, of, bad, books, catalogues, issued, by, the, roman, catholic, church, which, presumed, to, be, in, authority, over, private, thoughts, and, opinions, and, suppressed, views, that, went, against, its, doctrines, the, index, expurgatorius, was, administered, by, the, roman, inquisition, but, enforced, by, local, government, authorities, and, went, through, 300, editions, amongst, others, it, banned, or, censored, books, written, by, ren, descartes, giordano, bruno, galileo, galilei, david, hume, john, locke, daniel, defoe, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, voltaire, while, governments, and, church, encouraged, printing, in, many, ways, because, it, allowed, for, the, dissemination, of, bibles, and, government, information, works, of, dissent, and, criticism, could, also, circulate, rapidly, consequently, governments, established, controls, over, printers, across, europe, requiring, them, to, have, official, licenses, to, trade, and, produce, books, the, notion, that, the, expression, of, dissent, or, subversive, views, should, be, tolerated, not, censured, or, punished, by, law, developed, alongside, the, rise, of, printing, and, the, press, areopagitica, published, in, 1644, was, john, milton, s, response, to, the, parliament, of, england, s, re, introduction, of, government, licensing, of, printers, hence, publishers, church, authorities, had, previously, ensured, that, milton, s, essay, on, the, right, to, divorce, was, refused, a, license, for, publication, in, areopagitica, published, without, a, license, milton, made, an, impassioned, plea, for, freedom, of, expression, and, toleration, of, falsehood, stating, give, me, the, liberty, to, know, to, utter, and, to, argue, freely, according, to, conscience, above, all, liberties, milton, s, defense, of, freedom, of, expression, was, grounded, in, a, protestant, worldview, he, thought, that, the, english, people, had, the, mission, to, work, out, the, truth, of, the, reformation, which, would, lead, to, the, enlightenment, of, all, people, nevertheless, milton, also, articulated, the, main, strands, of, future, discussions, about, freedom, of, expression, by, defining, the, scope, of, freedom, of, expression, and, harmful, speech, milton, argued, against, the, principle, of, pre, censorship, and, in, favor, of, tolerance, for, a, wide, range, of, views, freedom, of, the, press, ceased, being, regulated, in, england, in, 1695, when, the, licensing, order, of, 1643, was, allowed, to, expire, after, the, introduction, of, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, shortly, after, the, glorious, revolution, the, emergence, of, publications, like, the, tatler, 1709, and, the, spectator, 1711, are, credited, for, creating, a, bourgeois, public, sphere, in, england, that, allowed, for, a, free, exchange, of, ideas, and, information, more, governments, attempted, to, centralize, control, as, the, menace, of, printing, spread, the, french, crown, repressed, printing, and, the, printer, etienne, dolet, was, burned, at, the, stake, in, 1546, in, 1557, the, british, crown, thought, to, stem, the, flow, of, seditious, and, heretical, books, by, chartering, the, stationers, company, the, right, to, print, was, limited, to, the, members, of, that, guild, thirty, years, later, the, star, chamber, was, chartered, to, curtail, the, greate, enormities, and, abuses, of, dyvers, contentyous, and, disorderlye, persons, professinge, the, arte, or, mystere, of, pryntinge, or, selling, of, books, the, right, to, print, was, restricted, to, two, universities, and, the, 21, existing, printers, in, the, city, of, london, which, had, 53, printing, presses, as, the, british, crown, took, control, of, type, founding, in, 1637, printers, fled, to, the, netherlands, confrontation, with, authority, made, printers, radical, and, rebellious, with, 800, authors, printers, and, book, dealers, being, incarcerated, in, the, bastille, in, paris, before, it, was, stormed, in, 1789, a, succession, of, english, thinkers, was, at, the, forefront, of, early, discussion, on, a, right, to, freedom, of, expression, among, them, john, milton, 1608, 74, and, john, locke, 1632, 1704, locke, established, the, individual, as, the, unit, of, value, and, the, bearer, of, rights, to, life, liberty, property, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, however, locke, s, ideas, evolved, primarily, around, the, concept, of, the, right, to, seek, salvation, for, one, s, soul, he, was, thus, primarily, concerned, with, theological, matters, locke, neither, supported, a, universal, toleration, of, peoples, nor, freedom, of, speech, according, to, his, ideas, some, groups, such, as, atheists, should, not, be, allowed, by, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, philosophers, on, the, european, continent, like, baruch, spinoza, and, pierre, bayle, developed, ideas, encompassing, a, more, universal, aspect, freedom, of, speech, and, toleration, than, the, early, english, philosophers, by, the, 18th, century, the, idea, of, freedom, of, speech, was, being, discussed, by, thinkers, all, over, the, western, world, especially, by, french, philosophes, like, denis, diderot, baron, d, holbach, and, claude, adrien, helv, tius, the, idea, began, to, be, incorporated, in, political, theory, both, in, theory, as, well, as, practice, the, first, state, edict, in, history, proclaiming, complete, freedom, of, speech, was, the, one, issued, 4, december, 1770, in, denmark, norway, during, the, regency, of, johann, friedrich, struensee, however, struensee, himself, imposed, some, minor, limitations, to, this, edict, on, 7, october, 1771, and, it, was, even, further, limited, after, the, fall, of, struensee, with, legislation, introduced, in, 1773, although, censorship, was, not, reintroduced, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, argued, that, without, human, freedom, there, could, be, no, progress, in, science, law, or, politics, which, according, to, mill, required, free, discussion, of, opinion, mill, s, on, liberty, published, in, 1859, became, a, classic, defence, of, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, mill, argued, that, truth, drives, out, falsity, therefore, the, free, expression, of, ideas, true, or, false, should, not, be, feared, truth, is, not, stable, or, fixed, but, evolves, with, time, mill, argued, that, much, of, what, we, once, considered, true, has, turned, out, false, therefore, views, should, not, be, prohibited, for, their, apparent, falsity, mill, also, argued, that, free, discussion, is, necessary, to, prevent, the, deep, slumber, of, a, decided, opinion, discussion, would, drive, the, march, of, truth, and, by, considering, false, views, the, basis, of, true, views, could, be, re, affirmed, furthermore, mill, argued, that, an, opinion, only, carries, intrinsic, value, to, the, owner, of, that, opinion, thus, silencing, the, expression, of, that, opinion, is, an, injustice, to, a, basic, human, right, it, is, generally, held, that, for, mill, the, only, instance, in, which, speech, can, be, justifiably, suppressed, is, to, prevent, harm, from, a, clear, and, direct, threat, neither, economic, or, moral, implications, nor, the, speaker, s, own, well, being, would, justify, suppression, of, speech, however, mill, in, on, liberty, suggests, the, speech, of, pimps, instigating, clients, and, sex, workers, to, have, sex, should, be, restricted, this, suggests, he, may, be, willing, to, restrict, some, speech, that, while, not, harming, others, undermines, their, decisional, autonomy, in, her, 1906, biography, of, voltaire, evelyn, beatrice, hall, coined, the, following, sentence, to, illustrate, voltaire, s, beliefs, i, disapprove, of, what, you, say, but, i, will, defend, to, the, death, your, right, to, say, it, hall, s, quote, is, frequently, cited, to, describe, the, principle, of, freedom, of, speech, noam, chomsky, stated, if, you, believe, in, freedom, of, speech, you, believe, in, freedom, of, speech, for, views, you, don, t, like, dictators, such, as, stalin, and, hitler, were, in, favor, of, freedom, of, speech, for, views, they, liked, only, if, you, re, in, favor, of, freedom, of, speech, that, means, you, re, in, favor, of, freedom, of, speech, precisely, for, views, you, despise, lee, bollinger, argues, that, the, free, speech, principle, involves, a, special, act, of, carving, out, one, area, of, social, interaction, for, extraordinary, self, restraint, the, purpose, of, which, is, to, develop, and, demonstrate, a, social, capacity, to, control, feelings, evoked, by, a, host, of, social, encounters, bollinger, argues, that, tolerance, is, a, desirable, value, if, not, essential, however, critics, argue, that, society, should, be, concerned, by, those, who, directly, deny, or, advocate, for, example, genocide, see, limitations, above, as, chairman, of, the, london, based, pen, international, a, club, which, defends, freedom, of, expression, and, a, free, press, english, author, h, g, wells, met, with, stalin,

society, that, saw, fit, to, ban, books, such, as, lady, chatterley, s, lover, because, it, was, likely, to, deprave, and, corrupt, its, readers, fred, kaplan, of, the, new, york, times, stated, the, overturning, of, the, obscenity, laws, set, off, an, explosion, of, free, speech, in, the, u, s, the, 1960s, also, saw, the, free, speech, movement, a, massive, long, lasting, student, protest, on,
