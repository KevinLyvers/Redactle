communication, is, commonly, defined, as, the, transmission, of, information, its, precise, definition, is, disputed, and, there, are, disagreements, about, whether, unintentional, or, failed, transmissions, are, included, and, whether, communication, not, only, transmits, meaning, but, also, creates, it, models, of, communication, are, simplified, overviews, of, its, main, components, and, their, interactions, many, models, include, the, idea, that, a, source, uses, a, coding, system, to, express, information, in, the, form, of, a, message, the, message, is, sent, through, a, channel, to, a, receiver, who, has, to, decode, it, to, understand, it, the, main, field, of, inquiry, investigating, communication, is, called, communication, studies, a, common, way, to, classify, communication, is, by, whether, information, is, exchanged, between, humans, members, of, other, species, or, non, living, entities, such, as, computers, for, human, communication, a, central, contrast, is, between, verbal, and, non, verbal, communication, verbal, communication, involves, the, exchange, of, messages, in, linguistic, form, including, spoken, and, written, messages, as, well, as, sign, language, non, verbal, communication, happens, without, the, use, of, a, linguistic, system, for, example, using, body, language, touch, and, facial, expressions, another, distinction, is, between, interpersonal, communication, which, happens, between, distinct, persons, and, intrapersonal, communication, which, is, communication, with, oneself, communicative, competence, is, the, ability, to, communicate, well, and, applies, to, the, skills, of, formulating, messages, and, understanding, them, non, human, forms, of, communication, include, animal, and, plant, communication, researchers, in, this, field, often, refine, their, definition, of, communicative, behavior, by, including, the, criteria, that, observable, responses, are, present, and, that, the, participants, benefit, from, the, exchange, animal, communication, is, used, in, areas, like, courtship, and, mating, parent, offspring, relations, navigation, and, self, defense, communication, through, chemicals, is, particularly, important, for, the, relatively, immobile, plants, for, example, maple, trees, release, so, called, volatile, organic, compounds, into, the, air, to, warn, other, plants, of, a, herbivore, attack, most, communication, takes, place, between, members, of, the, same, species, the, reason, is, that, its, purpose, is, usually, some, form, of, cooperation, which, is, not, as, common, between, different, species, interspecies, communication, happens, mainly, in, cases, of, symbiotic, relationships, for, instance, many, flowers, use, symmetrical, shapes, and, distinctive, colors, to, signal, to, insects, where, nectar, is, located, humans, engage, in, interspecies, communication, when, interacting, with, pets, and, working, animals, human, communication, has, a, long, history, and, how, people, exchange, information, has, changed, over, time, these, changes, were, usually, triggered, by, the, development, of, new, communication, technologies, examples, are, the, invention, of, writing, systems, the, development, of, mass, printing, the, use, of, radio, and, television, and, the, invention, of, the, internet, the, technological, advances, also, led, to, new, forms, of, communication, such, as, the, exchange, of, data, between, computers, the, word, communication, has, its, root, in, the, latin, verb, communicare, which, means, to, share, or, to, make, common, communication, is, usually, understood, as, the, transmission, of, information, a, message, is, conveyed, from, a, sender, to, a, receiver, using, some, medium, such, as, sound, written, signs, bodily, movements, or, electricity, sender, and, receiver, are, often, distinct, individuals, but, it, is, also, possible, for, an, individual, to, communicate, with, themselves, in, some, cases, sender, and, receiver, are, not, individuals, but, groups, like, organizations, social, classes, or, nations, in, a, different, sense, the, term, communication, refers, to, the, message, that, is, being, communicated, or, to, the, field, of, inquiry, studying, communicational, phenomena, the, precise, characterization, of, communication, is, disputed, many, scholars, have, raised, doubts, that, any, single, definition, can, capture, the, term, accurately, these, difficulties, come, from, the, fact, that, the, term, is, applied, to, diverse, phenomena, in, different, contexts, often, with, slightly, different, meanings, the, issue, of, the, right, definition, affects, the, research, process, on, many, levels, this, includes, issues, like, which, empirical, phenomena, are, observed, how, they, are, categorized, which, hypotheses, and, laws, are, formulated, as, well, as, how, systematic, theories, based, on, these, steps, are, articulated, some, definitions, are, broad, and, encompass, unconscious, and, non, human, behavior, under, a, broad, definition, many, animals, communicate, within, their, own, species, and, flowers, communicate, by, signaling, the, location, of, nectar, to, bees, through, their, colors, and, shapes, other, definitions, restrict, communication, to, conscious, interactions, among, human, beings, some, approaches, focus, on, the, use, of, symbols, and, signs, while, others, stress, the, role, of, understanding, interaction, power, or, transmission, of, ideas, various, characterizations, see, the, communicator, s, intent, to, send, a, message, as, a, central, component, in, this, view, the, transmission, of, information, is, not, sufficient, for, communication, if, it, happens, unintentionally, a, version, of, this, view, is, given, by, philosopher, paul, grice, who, identifies, communication, with, actions, that, aim, to, make, the, recipient, aware, of, the, communicator, s, intention, one, question, in, this, regard, is, whether, only, successful, transmissions, of, information, should, be, regarded, as, communication, for, example, distortion, may, interfere, with, and, change, the, actual, message, from, what, was, originally, intended, a, closely, related, problem, is, whether, acts, of, deliberate, deception, constitute, communication, according, to, a, broad, definition, by, literary, critic, i, a, richards, communication, happens, when, one, mind, acts, upon, its, environment, to, transmit, its, own, experience, to, another, mind, another, interpretation, is, given, by, communication, theorists, claude, shannon, and, warren, weaver, who, characterize, communication, as, a, transmission, of, information, brought, about, by, the, interaction, of, several, components, such, as, a, source, a, message, an, encoder, a, channel, a, decoder, and, a, receiver, the, transmission, view, is, rejected, by, transactional, and, constitutive, views, which, hold, that, communication, is, not, just, about, the, transmission, of, information, but, also, about, the, creation, of, meaning, transactional, and, constitutive, perspectives, hold, that, communication, shapes, the, participant, s, experience, by, conceptualizing, the, world, and, making, sense, of, their, environment, and, themselves, researchers, studying, animal, and, plant, communication, focus, less, on, meaning, making, instead, they, often, define, communicative, behavior, as, having, other, features, such, as, playing, a, beneficial, role, in, survival, and, reproduction, or, having, an, observable, response, models, of, communication, are, conceptual, representations, of, the, process, of, communication, their, goal, is, to, provide, a, simplified, overview, of, its, main, components, this, makes, it, easier, for, researchers, to, formulate, hypotheses, apply, communication, related, concepts, to, real, world, cases, and, test, predictions, due, to, their, simplified, presentation, they, may, lack, the, conceptual, complexity, needed, for, a, comprehensive, understanding, of, all, the, essential, aspects, of, communication, they, are, usually, presented, visually, in, the, form, of, diagrams, showing, the, basic, components, and, their, interaction, models, of, communication, are, often, categorized, based, on, their, intended, applications, and, how, they, conceptualize, communication, some, models, are, general, in, the, sense, that, they, are, intended, for, all, forms, of, communication, specialized, models, aim, to, describe, specific, forms, such, as, models, of, mass, communication, one, influential, way, to, classify, communication, is, to, distinguish, between, linear, transmission, interaction, and, transaction, models, linear, transmission, models, focus, on, how, a, sender, transmits, information, to, a, receiver, they, are, linear, because, this, flow, of, information, only, goes, in, a, single, direction, this, view, is, rejected, by, interaction, models, which, include, a, feedback, loop, feedback, is, needed, to, describe, many, forms, of, communication, such, as, a, conversation, where, the, listener, may, respond, to, a, speaker, by, expressing, their, opinion, or, by, asking, for, clarification, interaction, models, represent, the, process, as, a, form, of, two, way, communication, in, which, the, communicators, take, turns, sending, and, receiving, messages, transaction, models, further, refine, this, picture, by, allowing, representations, of, sending, and, responding, at, the, same, time, this, modification, is, needed, to, describe, how, the, listener, can, give, feedback, in, a, face, to, face, conversation, while, the, other, person, is, talking, examples, are, non, verbal, feedback, through, body, posture, and, facial, expression, transaction, models, also, hold, that, meaning, is, produced, during, communication, and, does, not, exist, independently, of, it, all, the, early, models, developed, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, are, linear, transmission, models, lasswell, s, model, for, example, is, based, on, five, fundamental, questions, who, says, what, in, which, channel, to, whom, and, with, what, effect, the, goal, of, these, questions, is, to, identify, the, basic, components, involved, in, the, communicative, process, the, sender, the, message, the, channel, the, receiver, and, the, effect, lasswell, s, model, was, initially, only, conceived, as, a, model, of, mass, communication, but, it, has, been, applied, to, other, fields, as, well, some, communication, theorists, like, richard, braddock, have, expanded, it, by, including, additional, questions, like, under, what, circumstances, and, for, what, purpose, the, shannon, weaver, model, is, another, influential, linear, transmission, model, it, is, based, on, the, idea, that, a, source, creates, a, message, which, is, then, translated, into, a, signal, by, a, transmitter, noise, may, interfere, with, and, distort, the, signal, once, the, signal, reaches, the, receiver, it, is, translated, back, into, a, message, and, made, available, to, the, destination, for, a, landline, telephone, call, the, person, calling, is, the, source, and, their, telephone, is, the, transmitter, the, transmitter, translates, the, message, into, an, electrical, signal, that, travels, through, the, wire, which, acts, as, the, channel, the, person, taking, the, call, is, the, destination, and, their, telephone, is, the, receiver, the, shannon, weaver, model, includes, an, in, depth, discussion, of, how, noise, can, distort, the, signal, and, how, successful, communication, can, be, achieved, despite, noise, this, can, happen, by, making, the, message, partially, redundant, so, that, decoding, is, possible, nonetheless, other, influential, linear, transmission, models, include, gerbner, s, model, and, berlo, s, model, the, earliest, interaction, model, was, developed, by, communication, theorist, wilbur, schramm, he, states, that, communication, starts, when, a, source, has, an, idea, and, expresses, it, in, the, form, of, a, message, this, process, is, called, encoding, and, happens, using, a, code, i, e, a, sign, system, that, is, able, to, express, the, idea, for, instance, through, visual, or, auditory, signs, the, message, is, sent, to, a, destination, who, has, to, decode, and, interpret, it, to, understand, it, in, response, they, formulate, their, own, idea, encode, it, into, a, message, and, send, it, back, as, a, form, of, feedback, another, innovation, of, schramm, s, model, is, that, previous, experience, is, necessary, to, be, able, to, encode, and, decode, messages, for, communication, to, be, successful, the, fields, of, experience, of, source, and, destination, have, to, overlap, the, first, transactional, model, was, proposed, by, communication, theorist, dean, barnlund, in, 1970, he, understands, communication, as, the, production, of, meaning, rather, than, the, production, of, messages, its, goal, is, to, decrease, uncertainty, and, arrive, at, a, shared, understanding, this, happens, in, response, to, external, and, internal, cues, decoding, is, the, process, of, ascribing, meaning, to, them, and, encoding, consists, in, producing, new, behavioral, cues, as, a, response, there, are, many, forms, of, human, communication, a, central, distinction, is, whether, language, is, used, as, in, the, contrast, between, verbal, and, non, verbal, communication, a, further, distinction, concerns, whether, one, communicates, with, others, or, with, oneself, as, in, the, contrast, between, interpersonal, and, intrapersonal, communication, forms, of, human, communication, are, also, categorized, by, their, channel, or, the, medium, used, to, transmit, messages, the, field, studying, human, communication, is, known, as, anthroposemiotics, verbal, communication, is, the, exchange, of, messages, in, linguistic, form, i, e, by, means, of, language, in, colloquial, usage, verbal, communication, is, sometimes, restricted, to, oral, communication, and, may, exclude, writing, and, sign, language, however, in, academic, discourse, the, term, is, usually, used, in, a, wider, sense, encompassing, any, form, of, linguistic, communication, whether, through, speech, writing, or, gestures, some, of, the, challenges, in, distinguishing, verbal, from, non, verbal, communication, come, from, the, difficulties, in, defining, what, exactly, language, means, language, is, usually, understood, as, a, conventional, system, of, symbols, and, rules, used, for, communication, such, systems, are, based, on, a, set, of, simple, units, of, meaning, that, can, be, combined, to, express, more, complex, ideas, the, rules, for, combining, the, units, into, compound, expressions, are, called, grammar, words, are, combined, to, form, sentences, one, hallmark, of, human, language, in, contrast, to, animal, communication, lies, in, its, complexity, and, expressive, power, human, language, can, be, used, to, refer, not, just, to, concrete, objects, in, the, here, and, now, but, also, to, spatially, and, temporally, distant, objects, and, to, abstract, ideas, humans, have, a, natural, tendency, to, acquire, their, native, language, in, childhood, they, are, also, able, to, learn, other, languages, later, in, life, as, second, languages, however, this, process, is, less, intuitive, and, often, does, not, result, in, the, same, level, of, linguistic, competence, the, academic, discipline, studying, language, is, called, linguistics, its, subfields, include, semantics, the, study, of, meaning, morphology, the, study, of, word, formation, syntax, the, study, of, sentence, structure, pragmatics, the, study, of, language, use, and, phonetics, the, study, of, basic, sounds, a, central, contrast, among, languages, is, between, natural, and, artificial, or, constructed, languages, natural, languages, like, english, spanish, and, japanese, developed, naturally, and, for, the, most, part, unplanned, in, the, course, of, history, artificial, languages, like, esperanto, quenya, c, and, the, language, of, first, order, logic, are, purposefully, designed, from, the, ground, up, most, everyday, verbal, communication, happens, using, natural, languages, central, forms, of, verbal, communication, are, speech, and, writing, together, with, their, counterparts, of, listening, and, reading, spoken, languages, use, sounds, to, produce, signs, and, transmit, meaning, while, for, writing, the, signs, are, physically, inscribed, on, a, surface, sign, languages, like, american, sign, language, and, nicaraguan, sign, language, are, another, form, of, verbal, communication, they, rely, on, visual, means, mostly, by, using, gestures, with, hands, and, arms, to, form, sentences, and, convey, meaning, verbal, communication, serves, various, functions, one, key, function, is, to, exchange, information, i, e, an, attempt, by, the, speaker, to, make, the, audience, aware, of, something, usually, of, an, external, event, but, language, can, also, be, used, to, express, the, speaker, s, feelings, and, attitudes, a, closely, related, role, is, to, establish, and, maintain, social, relations, with, other, people, verbal, communication, is, also, utilized, to, coordinate, one, s, behavior, with, others, and, influence, them, in, some, cases, language, is, not, employed, for, an, external, purpose, but, only, for, entertainment, or, personal, enjoyment, verbal, communication, further, helps, individuals, conceptualize, the, world, around, them, and, themselves, this, affects, how, perceptions, of, external, events, are, interpreted, how, things, are, categorized, and, how, ideas, are, organized, and, related, to, each, other, non, verbal, communication, is, the, exchange, of, information, through, non, linguistic, modes, like, facial, expressions, gestures, and, postures, however, not, every, form, of, non, verbal, behavior, constitutes, non, verbal, communication, some, theorists, like, judee, burgoon, hold, that, it, depends, on, the, existence, of, a, socially, shared, coding, system, that, is, used, to, interpret, the, meaning, of, non, verbal, behavior, non, verbal, communication, has, many, functions, it, frequently, contains, information, about, emotions, attitudes, personality, interpersonal, relations, and, private, thoughts, non, verbal, communication, often, happens, unintentionally, and, unconsciously, like, sweating, or, blushing, but, there, are, also, conscious, intentional, forms, like, shaking, hands, or, raising, a, thumb, it, often, happens, simultaneously, with, verbal, communication, and, helps, optimize, the, exchange, through, emphasis, and, illustration, or, by, adding, additional, information, non, verbal, cues, can, clarify, the, intent, behind, a, verbal, message, using, multiple, modalities, of, communication, in, this, way, usually, makes, communication, more, effective, if, the, messages, of, each, modality, are, consistent, however, in, some, cases, different, modalities, can, contain, conflicting, messages, for, example, a, person, may, verbally, agree, with, a, statement, but, press, their, lips, together, thereby, indicating, disagreement, non, verbally, there, are, many, forms, of, non, verbal, communication, they, include, kinesics, proxemics, haptics, paralanguage, chronemics, and, physical, appearance, kinesics, studies, the, role, of, bodily, behavior, in, conveying, information, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, body, language, even, though, it, is, strictly, speaking, not, a, language, but, rather, non, verbal, communication, it, includes, many, forms, like, gestures, postures, walking, styles, and, dance, facial, expressions, like, laughing, smiling, and, frowning, all, belong, to, kinesics, and, are, expressive, and, flexible, forms, of, communication, oculesics, is, another, subcategory, of, kinesics, in, regard, to, the, eyes, it, covers, questions, like, how, eye, contact, gaze, blink, rate, and, pupil, dilation, form, part, of, communication, some, kinesic, patterns, are, inborn, and, involuntary, like, blinking, while, others, are, learned, and, voluntary, like, giving, a, military, salute, proxemics, studies, how, personal, space, is, used, in, communication, the, distance, between, the, speakers, reflects, their, degree, of, familiarity, and, intimacy, with, each, other, as, well, as, their, social, status, haptics, examines, how, information, is, conveyed, using, touching, behavior, like, handshakes, holding, hands, kissing, or, slapping, meanings, linked, to, haptics, include, care, concern, anger, and, violence, for, instance, handshaking, is, often, seen, as, a, symbol, of, equality, and, fairness, while, refusing, to, shake, hands, can, indicate, aggressiveness, kissing, is, another, form, often, used, to, show, affection, and, erotic, closeness, paralanguage, also, known, as, vocalics, encompasses, non, verbal, elements, in, speech, that, convey, information, paralanguage, is, often, used, to, express, the, feelings, and, emotions, that, the, speaker, has, but, does, not, explicitly, stated, in, the, verbal, part, of, the, message, it, is, not, concerned, with, the, words, used, but, with, how, they, are, expressed, this, includes, elements, like, articulation, lip, control, rhythm, intensity, pitch, fluency, and, loudness, for, example, saying, something, loudly, and, in, a, high, pitch, conveys, a, different, meaning, on, the, non, verbal, level, than, whispering, the, same, words, paralanguage, is, mainly, concerned, with, spoken, language, but, also, includes, aspects, of, written, language, like, the, use, of, colors, and, fonts, as, well, as, spatial, arrangement, in, paragraphs, and, tables, non, linguistic, sounds, may, also, convey, information, crying, indicates, that, an, infant, is, distressed, and, babbling, conveys, information, about, infant, health, and, well, being, chronemics, concerns, the, use, of, time, such, as, what, messages, are, sent, by, being, on, time, versus, late, for, a, meeting, the, physical, appearance, of, the, communicator, such, as, height, weight, hair, skin, color, gender, clothing, tattooing, and, piercing, also, carries, information, appearance, is, an, important, factor, for, first, impressions, but, is, more, limited, as, a, mode, of, communication, since, it, is, less, changeable, some, forms, of, non, verbal, communication, happen, using, such, artifacts, as, drums, smoke, batons, traffic, lights, and, flags, non, verbal, communication, can, also, happen, through, visual, media, like, paintings, and, drawings, they, can, express, what, a, person, or, an, object, looks, like, and, can, also, convey, other, ideas, and, emotions, in, some, cases, this, type, of, non, verbal, communication, is, used, in, combination, with, verbal, communication, for, example, when, diagrams, or, maps, employ, labels, to, include, additional, linguistic, information, traditionally, most, research, focused, on, verbal, communication, however, this, paradigm, began, to, shift, in, the, 1950s, when, research, interest, in, non, verbal, communication, increased, and, emphasized, its, influence, for, example, many, judgments, about, the, nature, and, behavior, of, other, people, are, based, on, non, verbal, cues, it, is, further, present, in, almost, every, communicative, act, to, some, extent, and, certain, parts, of, it, are, universally, understood, these, considerations, have, prompted, some, communication, theorists, like, ray, birdwhistell, to, claim, that, the, majority, of, ideas, and, information, is, conveyed, this, way, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, human, communication, is, at, its, core, non, verbal, and, that, words, can, only, acquire, meaning, because, of, non, verbal, communication, the, earliest, forms, of, human, communication, such, as, crying, and, babbling, are, non, verbal, some, basic, forms, of, communication, happen, even, before, birth, between, mother, and, embryo, and, include, information, about, nutrition, and, emotions, non, verbal, communication, is, studied, in, various, fields, besides, communication, studies, like, linguistics, semiotics, anthropology, and, social, psychology, interpersonal, communication, is, communication, between, distinct, people, its, typical, form, is, dyadic, communication, i, e, between, two, people, but, it, can, also, refer, to, communication, within, groups, it, can, be, planned, or, unplanned, and, occurs, in, many, forms, like, when, greeting, someone, during, salary, negotiations, or, when, making, a, phone, call, some, communication, theorists, like, virginia, m, mcdermott, understand, interpersonal, communication, as, a, fuzzy, concept, that, manifests, in, degrees, in, this, view, an, exchange, varies, in, how, interpersonal, it, is, based, on, several, factors, it, depends, on, how, many, people, are, present, and, whether, it, happens, face, to, face, rather, than, through, telephone, or, email, a, further, factor, concerns, the, relation, between, the, communicators, group, communication, and, mass, communication, are, less, typical, forms, of, interpersonal, communication, and, some, theorists, treat, them, as, distinct, types, interpersonal, communication, can, be, synchronous, or, asynchronous, for, asynchronous, communication, the, parties, take, turns, in, sending, and, receiving, messages, this, occurs, when, exchanging, letters, or, emails, for, synchronous, communication, both, parties, send, messages, at, the, same, time, this, happens, when, one, person, is, talking, while, the, other, person, sends, non, verbal, messages, in, response, signaling, whether, they, agree, with, what, is, being, said, some, communication, theorists, like, sarah, trenholm, and, arthur, jensen, distinguish, between, content, messages, and, relational, messages, content, messages, express, the, speaker, s, feelings, toward, the, topic, of, discussion, relational, messages, on, the, other, hand, demonstrate, the, speaker, s, feelings, toward, their, relation, with, the, other, participants, various, theories, of, the, function, of, interpersonal, communication, have, been, proposed, some, focus, on, how, it, helps, people, make, sense, of, their, world, and, create, society, others, hold, that, its, primary, purpose, is, to, understand, why, other, people, act, the, way, they, do, and, to, adjust, one, s, behavior, accordingly, a, closely, related, approach, is, to, focus, on, information, and, see, interpersonal, communication, as, an, attempt, to, reduce, uncertainty, about, others, and, external, events, other, explanations, understand, it, in, terms, of, the, needs, it, satisfies, this, includes, the, needs, of, belonging, somewhere, being, included, being, liked, maintaining, relationships, and, influencing, the, behavior, of, others, on, a, practical, level, interpersonal, communication, is, used, to, coordinate, one, s, actions, with, the, actions, of, others, to, get, things, done, research, on, interpersonal, communication, includes, topics, like, how, people, build, maintain, and, dissolve, relationships, through, communication, other, questions, are, why, people, choose, one, message, rather, than, another, and, what, effects, these, messages, have, on, the, communicators, and, their, relation, a, further, topic, is, how, to, predict, whether, two, people, would, like, each, other, intrapersonal, communication, is, communication, with, oneself, in, some, cases, this, manifests, externally, like, when, engaged, in, a, monologue, taking, notes, highlighting, a, passage, and, writing, a, diary, or, a, shopping, list, but, many, forms, of, intrapersonal, communication, happen, internally, in, the, form, of, an, inner, exchange, with, oneself, like, when, thinking, about, something, or, daydreaming, closely, related, to, intrapersonal, communication, is, communication, that, takes, place, within, an, organism, below, the, personal, level, such, as, exchange, of, information, between, organs, or, cells, intrapersonal, communication, can, be, triggered, by, internal, and, external, stimuli, it, may, happen, in, the, form, of, articulating, a, phrase, before, expressing, it, externally, other, forms, are, to, make, plans, for, the, future, and, to, attempt, to, process, emotions, to, calm, oneself, down, in, stressful, situations, it, can, help, regulate, one, s, own, mental, activity, and, outward, behavior, as, well, as, internalize, cultural, norms, and, ways, of, thinking, external, forms, of, intrapersonal, communication, can, aid, one, s, memory, this, happens, for, example, when, making, a, shopping, list, another, use, is, to, unravel, difficult, problems, as, when, solving, a, complex, mathematical, equation, line, by, line, new, knowledge, can, also, be, internalized, this, way, like, when, repeating, new, vocabulary, to, oneself, because, of, these, functions, intrapersonal, communication, can, be, understood, as, an, exceptionally, powerful, and, pervasive, tool, for, thinking, based, on, its, role, in, self, regulation, some, theorists, have, suggested, that, intrapersonal, communication, is, more, basic, than, interpersonal, communication, young, children, sometimes, use, egocentric, speech, while, playing, in, an, attempt, to, direct, their, own, behavior, in, this, view, interpersonal, communication, only, develops, later, when, the, child, moves, from, their, early, egocentric, perspective, to, a, more, social, perspective, a, different, explanation, holds, that, interpersonal, communication, is, more, basic, since, it, is, first, used, by, parents, to, regulate, what, their, child, does, once, the, child, has, learned, this, they, can, apply, the, same, technique, to, themselves, to, get, more, control, over, their, own, behavior, for, communication, to, be, successful, the, message, has, to, travel, from, the, sender, to, the, receiver, the, channel, is, the, way, this, is, accomplished, it, is, not, concerned, with, the, meaning, of, the, message, but, only, with, the, technical, means, of, how, the, meaning, is, conveyed, channels, are, often, understood, in, terms, of, the, senses, used, to, perceive, the, message, i, e, hearing, seeing, smelling, touching, and, tasting, but, in, the, widest, sense, channels, encompass, any, form, of, transmission, including, technological, means, like, books, cables, radio, waves, telephones, or, television, naturally, transmitted, messages, usually, fade, rapidly, whereas, some, messages, using, artificial, channels, have, a, much, longer, lifespan, as, in, the, case, of, books, or, sculptures, the, physical, characteristics, of, a, channel, have, an, impact, on, the, code, and, cues, that, can, be, used, to, express, information, for, example, typical, telephone, calls, are, restricted, to, the, use, of, verbal, language, and, paralanguage, but, exclude, facial, expressions, it, is, often, possible, to, translate, messages, from, one, code, into, another, to, make, them, available, to, a, different, channel, an, example, is, writing, down, a, spoken, message, or, expressing, it, using, sign, language, the, transmission, of, information, can, occur, through, multiple, channels, at, once, for, example, face, to, face, communication, often, combines, the, auditory, channel, to, convey, verbal, information, with, the, visual, channel, to, transmit, non, verbal, information, using, gestures, and, facial, expressions, employing, multiple, channels, can, enhance, the, effectiveness, of, communication, by, helping, the, receiver, better, understand, the, subject, matter, the, choice, of, channels, often, matters, since, the, receiver, s, ability, to, understand, may, vary, depending, on, the, chosen, channel, for, instance, a, teacher, may, decide, to, present, some, information, orally, and, other, information, visually, depending, on, the, content, and, the, student, s, preferred, learning, style, this, underlines, the, role, of, a, media, adequate, approach, communicative, competence, is, the, ability, to, communicate, effectively, or, to, choose, the, appropriate, communicative, behavior, in, a, given, situation, it, concerns, what, to, say, when, to, say, it, and, how, to, say, it, it, further, includes, the, ability, to, receive, and, understand, messages, competence, is, often, contrasted, with, performance, since, competence, can, be, present, even, if, it, is, not, exercised, while, performance, consists, in, the, realization, of, this, competence, however, some, theorists, reject, a, stark, contrast, and, hold, that, performance, is, the, observable, part, and, is, used, to, infer, competence, in, relation, to, future, performances, two, central, components, of, communicative, competence, are, effectiveness, and, appropriateness, effectiveness, is, the, degree, to, which, the, speaker, achieves, their, desired, outcomes, or, the, degree, to, which, preferred, alternatives, are, realized, this, means, that, whether, a, communicative, behavior, is, effective, does, not, just, depend, on, the, actual, outcome, but, also, on, the, speaker, s, intention, i, e, whether, this, outcome, was, what, they, intended, to, achieve, because, of, this, some, theorists, additionally, require, that, the, speaker, be, able, to, give, an, explanation, of, why, they, engaged, in, one, behavior, rather, than, another, effectiveness, is, closely, related, to, efficiency, the, difference, being, that, effectiveness, is, about, achieving, goals, while, efficiency, is, about, using, few, resources, such, as, time, effort, and, money, in, the, process, appropriateness, means, that, the, communicative, behavior, meets, social, standards, and, expectations, communication, theorist, brian, h, spitzberg, defines, it, as, the, perceived, legitimacy, or, acceptability, of, behavior, or, enactments, in, a, given, context, this, means, that, the, speaker, is, aware, of, the, social, and, cultural, context, in, order, to, adapt, and, express, the, message, in, a, way, that, is, considered, acceptable, in, the, given, situation, for, example, to, bid, farewell, to, their, teacher, a, student, may, use, the, expression, goodbye, sir, but, not, the, expression, i, gotta, split, man, which, they, may, use, when, talking, to, a, peer, to, be, both, effective, and, appropriate, means, to, achieve, one, s, preferred, outcomes, in, a, way, that, follows, social, standards, and, expectations, some, definitions, of, communicative, competence, put, their, main, emphasis, on, either, effectiveness, or, appropriateness, while, others, combine, both, features, many, additional, components, of, communicative, competence, have, been, suggested, such, as, empathy, control, flexibility, sensitivity, and, knowledge, it, is, often, discussed, in, terms, of, the, individual, skills, employed, in, the, process, i, e, the, specific, behavioral, components, that, make, up, communicative, competence, message, production, skills, include, reading, and, writing, they, are, correlated, with, the, reception, skills, of, listening, and, reading, there, are, both, verbal, and, non, verbal, communication, skills, for, example, verbal, communication, skills, involve, the, proper, understanding, of, a, language, including, its, phonology, orthography, syntax, lexicon, and, semantics, many, aspects, of, human, life, depend, on, successful, communication, from, ensuring, basic, necessities, of, survival, to, building, and, maintaining, relationships, communicative, competence, is, a, key, factor, regarding, whether, a, person, is, able, to, reach, their, goals, in, social, life, like, having, a, successful, career, and, finding, a, suitable, spouse, because, of, this, it, can, have, a, large, impact, on, the, individual, s, well, being, the, lack, of, communicative, competence, can, cause, problems, both, on, the, individual, and, the, societal, level, including, professional, academic, and, health, problems, barriers, to, effective, communication, can, distort, the, message, they, may, result, in, failed, communication, and, cause, undesirable, effects, this, can, happen, if, the, message, is, poorly, expressed, because, it, uses, terms, with, which, the, receiver, is, not, familiar, or, because, it, is, not, relevant, to, the, receiver, s, needs, or, because, it, contains, too, little, or, too, much, information, distraction, selective, perception, and, lack, of, attention, to, feedback, may, also, be, responsible, noise, is, another, negative, factor, it, concerns, influences, that, interfere, with, the, message, on, its, way, to, the, receiver, and, distort, it, crackling, sounds, during, a, telephone, call, are, one, form, of, noise, ambiguous, expressions, can, also, inhibit, effective, communication, and, make, it, necessary, to, disambiguate, between, possible, interpretations, to, discern, the, sender, s, intention, these, interpretations, depend, also, on, the, cultural, background, of, the, participants, significant, cultural, differences, constitute, an, additional, obstacle, and, make, it, more, likely, that, messages, are, misinterpreted, besides, human, communication, there, are, many, other, forms, of, communication, found, in, the, animal, kingdom, and, among, plants, they, are, studied, in, fields, like, biocommunication, and, biosemiotics, there, are, additional, obstacles, in, this, area, for, judging, whether, communication, has, taken, place, between, two, individuals, acoustic, signals, are, often, easy, to, notice, and, analyze, for, scientists, but, it, is, more, difficult, to, judge, whether, tactile, or, chemical, changes, should, be, understood, as, communicative, signals, rather, than, as, other, biological, processes, for, this, reason, researchers, often, use, slightly, altered, definitions, of, communication, to, facilitate, their, work, a, common, assumption, in, this, regard, comes, from, evolutionary, biology, and, holds, that, communication, should, somehow, benefit, the, communicators, in, terms, of, natural, selection, the, biologists, rumsa, s, blatrix, and, veronika, mayer, define, communication, as, the, exchange, of, information, between, individuals, wherein, both, the, signaller, and, receiver, may, expect, to, benefit, from, the, exchange, according, to, this, view, the, sender, benefits, by, influencing, the, receiver, s, behavior, and, the, receiver, benefits, by, responding, to, the, signal, these, benefits, should, exist, on, average, but, not, necessarily, in, every, single, case, this, way, deceptive, signaling, can, also, be, understood, as, a, form, of, communication, one, problem, with, the, evolutionary, approach, is, that, it, is, often, difficult, to, assess, the, impact, of, such, behavior, on, natural, selection, another, common, pragmatic, constraint, is, to, hold, that, it, is, necessary, to, observe, a, response, by, the, receiver, following, the, signal, when, judging, whether, communication, has, occurred, animal, communication, is, the, process, of, giving, and, taking, information, among, animals, the, field, studying, animal, communication, is, called, zoosemiotics, there, are, many, parallels, to, human, communication, one, is, that, humans, and, many, animals, express, sympathy, by, synchronizing, their, movements, and, postures, nonetheless, there, are, also, significant, differences, like, the, fact, that, humans, also, engage, in, verbal, communication, which, uses, language, while, animal, communication, is, restricted, to, non, verbal, i, e, non, linguistic, communication, some, theorists, have, tried, to, distinguish, human, from, animal, communication, based, on, the, claim, that, animal, communication, lacks, a, referential, function, and, is, thus, not, able, to, refer, to, external, phenomena, however, various, observations, seem, to, contradict, this, view, such, as, the, warning, signals, in, response, to, different, types, of, predators, used, by, vervet, monkeys, gunnison, s, prairie, dogs, and, red, squirrels, a, further, approach, is, to, draw, the, distinction, based, on, the, complexity, of, human, language, especially, its, almost, limitless, ability, to, combine, basic, units, of, meaning, into, more, complex, meaning, structures, one, view, states, that, recursion, sets, human, language, apart, from, all, non, human, communicative, systems, another, difference, is, that, human, communication, is, frequently, linked, to, the, conscious, intention, to, send, information, which, is, often, not, discernable, for, animal, communication, despite, these, differences, some, theorists, use, the, term, animal, language, to, refer, to, certain, communicative, patterns, in, animal, behavior, that, have, similarities, with, human, language, animal, communication, can, take, a, variety, of, forms, including, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and, gustatory, communication, visual, communication, happens, in, the, form, of, movements, gestures, facial, expressions, and, colors, examples, are, movements, seen, during, mating, rituals, the, colors, of, birds, and, the, rhythmic, light, of, fireflies, auditory, communication, takes, place, through, vocalizations, by, species, like, birds, primates, and, dogs, auditory, signals, are, frequently, used, to, alert, and, warn, lower, order, living, systems, often, have, simple, response, patterns, to, auditory, messages, reacting, either, by, approach, or, avoidance, more, complex, response, patterns, are, observed, for, higher, animals, which, may, use, different, signals, for, different, types, of, predators, and, responses, for, example, some, primates, use, one, set, of, signals, for, airborne, predators, and, another, for, land, predators, tactile, communication, occurs, through, touch, vibration, stroking, rubbing, and, pressure, it, is, especially, relevant, for, parent, young, relations, courtship, social, greetings, and, defense, olfactory, and, gustatory, communication, happen, chemically, through, smells, and, tastes, respectively, there, are, large, differences, between, species, concerning, what, functions, communication, plays, how, much, it, is, realized, and, the, behavior, used, to, communicate, common, functions, include, the, fields, of, courtship, and, mating, parent, offspring, relations, social, relations, navigation, self, defense, and, territoriality, one, part, of, courtship, and, mating, consists, in, identifying, and, attracting, potential, mates, this, can, happen, through, various, means, grasshoppers, and, crickets, communicate, acoustically, by, using, songs, moths, rely, on, chemical, means, by, releasing, pheromones, and, fireflies, send, visual, messages, by, flashing, light, for, some, species, the, offspring, depends, on, the, parent, for, its, survival, one, central, function, of, parent, offspring, communication, is, to, recognize, each, other, in, some, cases, the, parents, are, also, able, to, guide, the, offspring, s, behavior, social, animals, like, chimpanzees, bonobos, wolves, and, dogs, engage, in, various, forms, of, communication, to, express, their, feelings, and, build, relations, communication, can, aid, navigation, by, helping, animals, move, through, their, environment, in, a, purposeful, way, e, g, to, locate, food, avoid, enemies, and, follow, other, animals, in, bats, this, happens, through, echolocation, i, e, by, sending, auditory, signals, and, processing, the, information, from, the, echoes, bees, are, another, often, discussed, case, in, this, respect, since, they, perform, a, type, of, dance, to, indicate, to, other, bees, where, flowers, are, located, in, regard, to, self, defense, communication, is, used, to, warn, others, and, to, assess, whether, a, costly, fight, can, be, avoided, another, function, of, communication, is, to, mark, and, claim, territories, used, for, food, and, mating, for, example, some, male, birds, claim, a, hedge, or, part, of, a, meadow, by, using, songs, to, keep, other, males, away, and, attract, females, two, competing, theories, in, the, study, of, animal, communication, are, nature, theory, and, nurture, theory, their, conflict, concerns, to, what, extent, animal, communication, is, programmed, into, the, genes, as, a, form, of, adaptation, rather, than, learned, from, previous, experience, as, a, form, of, conditioning, to, the, degree, that, it, is, learned, it, usually, happens, through, imprinting, i, e, as, a, form, of, learning, that, only, occurs, in, a, certain, phase, and, is, then, mostly, irreversible, plant, communication, refers, to, plant, processes, involving, the, sending, and, receiving, of, information, the, field, studying, plant, communication, is, called, phytosemiotics, this, field, poses, additional, difficulties, for, researchers, since, plants, are, different, from, humans, and, other, animals, in, that, they, lack, a, central, nervous, system, and, have, rigid, cell, walls, these, walls, restrict, movement, and, usually, prevent, plants, from, sending, and, receiving, signals, that, depend, on, rapid, movement, however, there, are, some, similarities, since, plants, face, many, of, the, same, challenges, as, animals, for, example, they, need, to, find, resources, avoid, predators, and, pathogens, find, mates, and, ensure, that, their, offspring, survive, many, of, the, evolutionary, responses, to, these, challenges, are, analogous, to, those, in, animals, but, are, implemented, using, different, means, one, crucial, difference, is, that, chemical, communication, is, much, more, prominent, in, the, plant, kingdom, in, contrast, to, the, importance, of, visual, and, auditory, communication, for, animals, in, plants, the, term, behavior, is, usually, not, defined, in, terms, of, physical, movement, as, is, the, case, for, animals, but, as, a, biochemical, response, to, a, stimulus, this, response, has, to, be, short, relative, to, the, plant, s, lifespan, communication, is, a, special, form, of, behavior, that, involves, conveying, information, from, a, sender, to, a, receiver, it, is, distinguished, from, other, types, of, behavior, like, defensive, reactions, and, mere, sensing, like, in, the, field, of, animal, communication, plant, communication, researchers, often, require, as, additional, criteria, that, there, is, some, form, of, response, in, the, receiver, and, that, the, communicative, behavior, is, beneficial, to, sender, and, receiver, biologist, richard, karban, distinguishes, three, steps, of, plant, communication, the, emission, of, a, cue, by, a, sender, the, perception, of, the, cue, by, a, receiver, and, the, receiver, s, response, for, plant, communication, it, is, not, relevant, to, what, extent, the, emission, of, a, cue, is, intentional, however, it, should, be, possible, for, the, receiver, to, ignore, the, signal, this, criterion, can, be, used, to, distinguish, a, response, to, a, signal, from, a, defense, mechanism, against, an, unwanted, change, like, intense, heat, plant, communication, happens, in, various, forms, it, includes, communication, within, plants, i, e, within, plant, cells, and, between, plant, cells, between, plants, of, the, same, or, related, species, and, between, plants, and, non, plant, organisms, especially, in, the, root, zone, a, prominent, form, of, communication, is, airborne, and, happens, through, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, for, example, maple, trees, release, vocs, when, they, are, attacked, by, a, herbivore, to, warn, neighboring, plants, which, then, react, accordingly, by, adjusting, their, defenses, another, form, of, plant, to, plant, communication, happens, through, mycorrhizal, fungi, these, fungi, form, underground, networks, colloquially, referred, to, as, the, wood, wide, web, and, connect, the, roots, of, different, plants, the, plants, use, the, network, to, send, messages, to, each, other, specifically, to, warn, other, plants, of, a, pest, attack, and, to, help, prepare, their, defenses, communication, can, also, be, observed, for, fungi, and, bacteria, some, fungal, species, communicate, by, releasing, pheromones, into, the, external, environment, for, instance, they, are, used, to, promote, sexual, interaction, in, several, aquatic, fungal, species, one, form, of, communication, between, bacteria, is, called, quorum, sensing, it, happens, by, releasing, hormone, like, molecules, which, other, bacteria, detect, and, respond, to, this, process, is, used, to, monitor, the, environment, for, other, bacteria, and, to, coordinate, population, wide, responses, for, example, by, sensing, the, density, of, bacteria, and, regulating, gene, expression, accordingly, other, possible, responses, include, the, induction, of, bioluminescence, and, the, formation, of, biofilms, most, communication, happens, between, members, within, a, species, as, intraspecies, communication, this, is, because, the, purpose, of, communication, is, usually, some, form, of, cooperation, cooperation, happens, mostly, within, a, species, while, different, species, are, often, in, conflict, with, each, other, by, competing, over, resources, however, there, are, also, some, forms, of, interspecies, communication, this, occurs, especially, for, symbiotic, relations, and, significantly, less, for, parasitic, or, predator, prey, relations, interspecies, communication, plays, a, key, role, for, plants, that, depend, on, external, agents, for, reproduction, for, example, flowers, need, insects, for, pollination, and, provide, resources, like, nectar, and, other, rewards, in, return, they, use, communication, to, signal, their, benefits, and, attract, visitors, by, using, distinctive, colors, and, symmetrical, shapes, to, stand, out, from, their, surroundings, this, form, of, advertisement, is, necessary, since, flowers, compete, with, each, other, for, visitors, many, fruit, bearing, plants, rely, on, plant, to, animal, communication, to, disperse, their, seeds, and, move, them, to, a, favorable, location, this, happens, by, providing, nutritious, fruits, to, animals, the, seeds, are, eaten, together, with, the, fruit, and, are, later, excreted, at, a, different, location, communication, makes, animals, aware, of, where, the, fruits, are, and, whether, they, are, ripe, for, many, fruits, this, happens, through, their, color, they, have, an, inconspicuous, green, color, until, they, ripen, and, take, on, a, new, color, that, stands, in, visual, contrast, to, the, environment, another, example, of, interspecies, communication, is, found, in, the, ant, plant, relation, it, concerns, for, instance, the, selection, of, seeds, by, ants, for, their, ant, gardens, and, the, pruning, of, exogenous, vegetation, as, well, as, plant, protection, by, ants, some, animal, species, also, engage, in, interspecies, communication, like, apes, whales, dolphins, elephants, and, dogs, for, example, different, species, of, monkeys, use, common, signals, to, cooperate, when, threatened, by, a, common, predator, humans, engage, in, interspecies, communication, when, interacting, with, pets, and, working, animals, for, instance, acoustic, signals, play, a, central, role, in, communication, with, dogs, dogs, can, learn, to, react, to, various, commands, like, sit, and, come, they, can, even, be, trained, to, respond, to, short, syntactic, combinations, like, bring, x, or, put, x, in, a, box, they, also, react, to, the, pitch, and, frequency, of, the, human, voice, to, detect, emotions, dominance, and, uncertainty, dogs, use, a, range, of, behavioral, patterns, to, convey, their, emotions, to, humans, for, example, in, regard, to, aggressiveness, fearfulness, and, playfulness, computer, communication, concerns, the, exchange, of, data, between, computers, and, similar, devices, for, this, to, be, possible, the, devices, have, to, be, connected, through, a, transmission, system, that, forms, a, network, between, them, a, transmitter, is, needed, to, send, messages, and, a, receiver, is, needed, to, receive, them, a, personal, computer, may, use, a, modem, as, a, transmitter, to, send, information, to, a, server, through, the, public, telephone, network, as, the, transmission, system, the, server, may, use, a, modem, as, its, receiver, to, transmit, the, data, it, has, to, be, converted, into, an, electric, signal, communication, channels, used, for, transmission, are, either, analog, or, digital, and, are, characterized, by, features, like, bandwidth, and, latency, there, are, many, forms, of, computer, networks, the, most, commonly, discussed, ones, are, lans, and, wans, lan, stands, for, local, area, network, which, is, a, computer, network, within, a, limited, area, usually, with, a, distance, of, less, than, one, kilometer, this, is, the, case, when, connecting, two, computers, within, a, home, or, an, office, building, lans, can, be, set, up, using, a, wired, connection, like, ethernet, or, a, wireless, connection, like, wi, fi, wans, on, the, other, hand, are, wide, area, networks, that, span, large, geographical, regions, like, the, internet, their, networks, are, more, complex, and, may, use, several, intermediate, connection, nodes, to, transfer, information, between, endpoints, further, types, of, computer, networks, include, pans, personal, area, networks, cans, campus, area, networks, and, mans, metropolitan, area, networks, for, computer, communication, to, be, successful, the, involved, devices, have, to, follow, a, common, set, of, conventions, governing, their, exchange, these, conventions, are, known, as, the, communication, protocol, they, concern, various, aspects, of, the, exchange, like, the, format, of, messages, and, how, to, respond, to, transmission, errors, they, also, cover, how, the, two, systems, are, synchronized, for, example, how, the, receiver, identifies, the, start, and, end, of, a, signal, based, on, the, flow, of, informations, systems, are, categorized, as, simplex, half, duplex, and, full, duplex, for, simplex, systems, signals, flow, only, in, one, direction, from, the, sender, to, the, receiver, like, in, radio, cable, television, and, screens, displaying, arrivals, and, departures, at, airports, half, duplex, systems, allow, two, way, exchanges, but, signals, can, only, flow, in, one, direction, at, a, time, like, walkie, talkies, and, police, radios, in, the, case, of, full, duplex, systems, signals, can, flow, in, both, directions, at, the, same, time, like, regular, telephone, and, internet, in, either, case, it, is, often, important, for, successful, communication, that, the, connection, is, secure, to, ensure, that, the, transmitted, data, reaches, only, the, intended, destination, and, is, not, intercepted, by, an, unauthorized, third, party, this, can, be, achieved, by, using, cryptography, which, changes, the, format, of, the, transmitted, information, to, make, it, unintelligible, to, potential, interceptors, human, computer, communication, is, a, closely, related, field, that, concerns, topics, like, how, humans, interact, with, computers, and, how, data, in, the, form, of, inputs, and, outputs, is, exchanged, this, happens, through, a, user, interface, which, includes, the, hardware, used, to, interact, with, the, computer, like, a, mouse, a, keyboard, and, a, monitor, as, well, as, the, software, used, in, the, process, on, the, software, side, most, early, user, interfaces, were, command, line, interfaces, in, which, the, user, must, type, a, command, to, interact, with, the, computer, most, modern, user, interfaces, are, graphical, user, interfaces, like, microsoft, windows, and, macos, which, are, usually, much, easier, to, use, for, non, experts, they, involve, graphical, elements, through, which, the, user, can, interact, with, the, computer, commonly, using, a, design, concept, known, as, skeumorphism, to, make, a, new, concept, feel, familiar, and, speed, up, understanding, by, mimicking, the, real, world, equivalent, of, the, interface, object, examples, include, the, typical, computer, folder, icon, and, recycle, bin, used, for, discarding, files, one, aim, when, designing, user, interfaces, is, to, simplify, the, interaction, with, computers, this, helps, make, them, more, user, friendly, and, accessible, to, a, wider, audience, while, also, increasing, productivity, communication, studies, also, referred, to, as, communication, science, is, the, academic, discipline, studying, communication, it, is, closely, related, to, semiotics, with, one, difference, being, that, communication, studies, focuses, more, on, technical, questions, of, how, messages, are, sent, received, and, processed, semiotics, on, the, other, hand, tackles, more, abstract, questions, in, relation, to, meaning, and, how, signs, acquire, it, communication, studies, covers, a, wide, area, overlapping, with, many, other, disciplines, such, as, biology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, linguistics, media, studies, and, journalism, many, contributions, in, the, field, of, communication, studies, focus, on, developing, models, and, theories, of, communication, models, of, communication, aim, to, give, a, simplified, overview, of, the, main, components, involved, in, communication, theories, of, communication, try, to, provide, conceptual, frameworks, to, accurately, present, communication, in, all, its, complexity, some, theories, focus, on, communication, as, a, practical, art, of, discourse, while, others, explore, the, roles, of, signs, experience, information, processing, and, the, goal, of, building, a, social, order, through, coordinated, interaction, communication, studies, is, also, interested, in, the, functions, and, effects, of, communication, it, covers, issues, like, how, communication, satisfies, physiological, and, psychological, needs, helps, build, relationships, and, assists, in, gathering, information, about, the, environment, other, individuals, and, oneself, a, further, topic, concerns, the, question, of, how, communication, systems, change, over, time, and, how, these, changes, correlate, with, other, societal, changes, a, related, topic, focuses, on, psychological, principles, underlying, those, changes, and, the, effects, they, have, on, how, people, exchange, ideas, communication, was, studied, as, early, as, ancient, greece, early, influential, theories, were, created, by, plato, and, aristotle, who, stressed, public, speaking, and, the, understanding, of, rhetoric, according, to, aristotle, for, example, the, goal, of, communication, is, to, persuade, the, audience, the, field, of, communication, studies, only, became, a, separate, research, discipline, in, the, 20th, century, especially, starting, in, the, 1940s, the, development, of, new, communication, technologies, such, as, telephone, radio, newspapers, television, and, the, internet, has, had, a, big, impact, on, communication, and, communication, studies, today, communication, studies, is, a, wide, discipline, some, works, in, it, try, to, provide, a, general, characterization, of, communication, in, the, widest, sense, others, attempt, to, give, a, precise, analysis, of, one, specific, form, of, communication, communication, studies, includes, many, subfields, some, focus, on, wide, topics, like, interpersonal, communication, intrapersonal, communication, verbal, communication, and, non, verbal, communication, others, investigate, communication, within, a, specific, area, organizational, communication, concerns, communication, between, members, of, organizations, such, as, corporations, nonprofits, or, small, businesses, central, in, this, regard, is, the, coordination, of, the, behavior, of, the, different, members, as, well, as, the, interaction, with, customers, and, the, general, public, closely, related, terms, are, business, communication, corporate, communication, and, professional, communication, the, main, element, of, marketing, communication, is, advertising, but, it, also, encompasses, other, communication, activities, aimed, at, advancing, the, organization, s, objective, to, its, audiences, like, public, relations, political, communication, covers, topics, like, electoral, campaigns, to, influence, voters, and, legislative, communication, like, letters, to, a, congress, or, committee, documents, specific, emphasis, is, often, given, to, propaganda, and, the, role, of, mass, media, intercultural, communication, is, relevant, to, both, organizational, and, political, communication, since, they, often, involve, attempts, to, exchange, messages, between, communicators, from, different, cultural, backgrounds, the, cultural, background, affects, how, messages, are, formulated, and, interpreted, and, can, be, the, cause, of, misunderstandings, it, is, also, relevant, for, development, communication, which, is, about, the, use, of, communication, for, assisting, in, development, like, aid, given, by, first, world, countries, to, third, world, countries, health, communication, concerns, communication, in, the, field, of, healthcare, and, health, promotion, efforts, one, of, its, topics, is, how, healthcare, providers, like, doctors, and, nurses, should, communicate, with, their, patients, communication, history, studies, how, communicative, processes, evolved, and, interacted, with, society, culture, and, technology, human, communication, has, a, long, history, and, the, way, people, communicate, has, changed, considerably, over, time, many, of, these, changes, were, triggered, by, the, development, of, new, communication, technologies, and, had, various, effects, on, how, people, exchanged, ideas, new, communication, technologies, usually, require, new, skills, that, people, need, to, learn, to, use, them, effectively, in, the, academic, literature, the, history, of, communication, is, usually, divided, into, ages, based, on, the, dominant, form, of, communication, in, that, age, the, number, of, ages, and, the, precise, periodization, are, disputed, they, usually, include, ages, for, speaking, writing, and, print, as, well, as, electronic, mass, communication, and, the, internet, according, to, communication, theorist, marshall, poe, the, dominant, media, for, each, age, can, be, characterized, in, relation, to, several, factors, they, include, the, amount, of, information, a, medium, can, store, how, long, it, persists, how, much, time, it, takes, to, transmit, it, and, how, costly, it, is, to, use, the, medium, poe, argues, that, subsequent, ages, usually, involve, some, form, of, improvement, of, one, or, more, of, the, factors, according, to, some, scientific, estimates, language, developed, around, 40, 000, years, ago, while, others, consider, it, to, be, much, older, before, this, development, human, communication, resembled, animal, communication, and, happened, through, a, combination, of, grunts, cries, gestures, and, facial, expressions, language, helped, early, humans, to, organize, themselves, and, plan, ahead, more, efficiently, in, early, societies, spoken, language, was, the, primary, form, of, communication, most, knowledge, was, passed, on, through, it, often, in, the, form, of, stories, or, wise, sayings, this, form, does, not, produce, stable, knowledge, since, it, depends, on, imperfect, human, memory, because, of, this, many, details, differ, from, one, telling, to, the, next, and, are, presented, differently, by, distinct, storytellers, as, people, started, to, settle, and, form, agricultural, communities, societies, grew, and, there, was, an, increased, need, for, stable, records, of, ownership, of, land, and, commercial, transactions, this, triggered, the, invention, of, writing, which, is, able, to, solve, many, problems, that, arose, from, using, exclusively, oral, communication, it, is, much, more, efficient, at, preserving, knowledge, and, passing, it, on, between, generations, since, it, does, not, depend, on, human, memory, before, the, invention, of, writing, certain, forms, of, proto, writing, had, already, developed, proto, writing, encompasses, long, lasting, visible, marks, used, to, store, information, like, decorations, on, pottery, items, knots, in, a, cord, to, track, goods, or, seals, to, mark, property, most, early, written, communication, happened, through, pictograms, pictograms, are, graphical, symbols, that, convey, meaning, by, visually, resembling, real, world, objects, the, use, of, basic, pictographic, symbols, to, represent, things, like, farming, produce, was, common, in, ancient, cultures, and, began, around, 9000, bce, the, first, complex, writing, system, including, pictograms, was, developed, around, 3500, bce, by, the, sumerians, and, is, called, cuneiform, pictograms, are, still, in, use, today, like, no, smoking, signs, and, the, symbols, of, male, and, female, figures, on, bathroom, doors, a, significant, disadvantage, of, pictographic, writing, systems, is, that, they, need, a, large, amount, of, symbols, to, refer, to, all, the, objects, one, wants, to, talk, about, this, problem, was, solved, by, the, development, of, other, writing, systems, for, example, the, symbols, of, alphabetic, writing, systems, do, not, stand, for, regular, objects, instead, they, relate, to, the, sounds, used, in, spoken, language, other, types, of, early, writing, systems, include, logographic, and, ideographic, writing, systems, a, drawback, of, many, early, forms, of, writing, like, the, clay, tablets, used, for, cuneiform, was, that, they, were, not, very, portable, this, made, it, difficult, to, transport, the, texts, from, one, location, to, another, to, share, information, this, changed, with, the, invention, of, papyrus, by, the, egyptians, around, 2500, bce, and, was, further, improved, later, by, the, development, of, parchment, and, paper, until, the, 1400s, almost, all, written, communication, was, hand, written, which, limited, the, spread, of, written, media, within, society, since, copying, texts, by, hand, was, costly, the, introduction, and, popularization, of, mass, printing, in, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, by, johann, gutenberg, resulted, in, rapid, changes, mass, printing, quickly, increased, the, circulation, of, written, media, and, also, led, to, the, dissemination, of, new, forms, of, written, documents, like, newspapers, and, pamphlets, one, side, effect, was, that, the, augmented, availability, of, written, documents, significantly, improved, the, general, literacy, of, the, population, this, development, served, as, the, foundation, for, revolutions, in, various, fields, including, science, politics, and, religion, scientific, discoveries, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, caused, many, further, developments, in, the, history, of, communication, they, include, the, invention, of, telegraphs, and, telephones, which, made, it, even, easier, and, faster, to, transmit, information, from, one, location, to, another, without, the, need, to, transport, written, documents, these, communication, forms, were, initially, limited, to, cable, connections, which, had, to, be, established, first, later, developments, found, ways, of, wireless, transmission, using, radio, signals, they, made, it, possible, to, reach, wide, audiences, and, radio, soon, became, one, of, the, central, forms, of, mass, communication, various, innovations, in, the, field, of, photography, enabled, the, recording, of, images, on, film, which, led, to, the, development, of, cinema, and, television, the, reach, of, wireless, communication, was, further, enhanced, with, the, development, of, satellites, which, made, it, possible, to, broadcast, radio, and, television, signals, to, stations, all, over, the, world, this, way, information, could, be, shared, almost, instantly, everywhere, around, the, globe, the, development, of, the, internet, constitutes, a, further, milestone, in, the, history, of, communication, it, made, it, easier, than, ever, before, for, people, to, exchange, ideas, collaborate, and, access, information, from, anywhere, in, the, world, by, using, a, variety, of, means, such, as, websites, e, mail, social, media, and, video,
