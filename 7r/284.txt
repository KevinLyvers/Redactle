the, organization, of, the, petroleum, exporting, countries, opec, o, p, k, oh, pek, is, an, organization, enabling, the, co, operation, of, leading, oil, producing, and, oil, dependent, countries, in, order, to, collectively, influence, the, global, oil, market, and, maximize, profit, it, was, founded, on, 14, september, 1960, in, baghdad, by, the, first, five, members, iran, iraq, kuwait, saudi, arabia, and, venezuela, the, organization, which, currently, comprises, 12, member, countries, accounted, for, an, estimated, 30, percent, of, global, oil, production, a, 2022, report, further, details, that, opec, member, countries, were, responsible, for, approximately, 38, percent, of, it, additionally, it, is, estimated, that, 79, 5, percent, of, the, world, s, proven, oil, reserves, are, located, within, opec, nations, with, the, middle, east, alone, accounting, for, 67, 2, percent, of, opec, s, total, reserves, in, a, series, of, steps, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, opec, restructured, the, global, system, of, oil, production, in, favor, of, oil, producing, states, and, away, from, an, oligopoly, of, dominant, anglo, american, oil, firms, the, seven, sisters, in, the, 1970s, restrictions, in, oil, production, led, to, a, dramatic, rise, in, oil, prices, with, long, lasting, and, far, reaching, consequences, for, the, global, economy, since, the, 1980s, opec, has, had, a, limited, impact, on, world, oil, supply, and, oil, price, stability, as, there, is, frequent, cheating, by, members, on, their, commitments, to, one, another, and, as, member, commitments, reflect, what, they, would, do, even, in, the, absence, of, opec, however, since, 2020, opec, countries, along, with, non, opec, participants, had, helped, in, stabilising, oil, markets, after, the, covid, 19, pandemic, resulted, in, a, collapse, in, oil, demand, this, has, allowed, oil, markets, to, remain, stable, relative, to, other, energy, markets, that, experienced, unprecedented, volatility, the, formation, of, opec, marked, a, turning, point, toward, national, sovereignty, over, natural, resources, opec, decisions, have, come, to, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, global, oil, market, and, in, international, relations, economists, have, characterized, opec, as, a, textbook, example, of, a, cartel, a, group, whose, members, cooperate, to, reduce, market, competition, but, one, whose, consultations, may, be, protected, by, the, doctrine, of, state, immunity, under, international, law, current, opec, members, are, algeria, equatorial, guinea, gabon, iran, iraq, kuwait, libya, nigeria, the, republic, of, the, congo, saudi, arabia, the, united, arab, emirates, and, venezuela, meanwhile, angola, ecuador, indonesia, and, qatar, are, former, opec, members, a, larger, group, called, opec, consisting, of, opec, members, plus, other, oil, producing, countries, formed, in, late, 2016, to, exert, more, control, on, the, global, crude, oil, market, canada, egypt, norway, and, oman, are, observer, states, in, a, series, of, steps, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, opec, restructured, the, global, system, of, oil, production, in, favor, of, oil, producing, states, and, away, from, an, oligopoly, of, dominant, anglo, american, oil, firms, the, seven, sisters, coordination, among, oil, producing, states, within, opec, made, it, easier, for, them, to, nationalize, oil, production, and, structure, oil, prices, in, their, favor, without, incurring, punishment, by, western, governments, and, firms, prior, to, the, creation, of, opec, individual, oil, producing, states, were, punished, for, taking, steps, to, alter, the, governing, arrangements, of, oil, production, within, their, borders, states, were, coerced, militarily, e, g, in, 1953, the, us, uk, sponsored, a, coup, against, mohammad, mosaddegh, after, he, nationalized, iran, s, oil, production, or, economically, e, g, the, seven, sisters, slowed, down, oil, production, in, one, non, compliant, state, and, ramped, up, oil, production, elsewhere, when, acted, contrary, to, the, interests, of, the, seven, sisters, and, their, governments, the, organisational, logic, that, underpins, opec, is, that, it, is, in, the, collective, interest, of, its, members, to, limit, the, world, oil, supply, in, order, to, reap, higher, prices, however, the, main, problem, within, opec, is, that, it, is, individually, rational, for, members, to, cheat, on, commitments, and, produce, as, much, oil, as, possible, political, scientist, jeff, colgan, has, argued, that, opec, has, since, the, 1980s, largely, failed, to, achieve, its, goals, limits, on, world, oil, supply, stabilized, prices, and, raising, of, long, term, average, revenues, he, finds, that, members, have, cheated, on, 96, of, their, commitments, the, analysis, spans, over, the, period, 1982, 2009, to, the, extent, that, when, member, states, comply, with, their, commitments, it, is, because, the, commitments, reflect, what, they, would, do, even, if, opec, did, not, exist, one, large, reason, for, the, frequent, cheating, is, that, opec, does, not, punish, members, for, non, compliance, with, commitments, in, june, 2020, all, countries, participating, in, the, opec, framework, collectively, agreed, to, the, introduction, of, a, compensation, mechanism, aimed, at, ensuring, full, conformity, with, and, adherence, to, the, agreed, upon, oil, production, cuts, this, initiative, aligns, with, one, of, opec, s, stated, objectives, to, maintain, a, stable, oil, market, which, notably, has, been, relatively, more, stable, than, other, energy, commodities, the, opec, conference, is, the, supreme, authority, of, the, organisation, and, consists, of, delegations, normally, headed, by, the, oil, ministers, of, member, countries, the, chief, executive, of, the, organisation, is, the, opec, secretary, general, the, conference, ordinarily, meets, at, the, vienna, headquarters, at, least, twice, a, year, and, in, additional, extraordinary, sessions, when, necessary, it, generally, operates, on, the, principles, of, unanimity, and, one, member, one, vote, with, each, country, paying, an, equal, membership, fee, into, the, annual, budget, however, since, saudi, arabia, is, by, far, the, largest, and, most, profitable, oil, exporter, in, the, world, with, enough, capacity, to, function, as, the, traditional, swing, producer, to, balance, the, global, market, it, serves, as, opec, s, de, facto, leader, at, various, times, opec, members, have, displayed, apparent, anti, competitive, cartel, behavior, through, the, organisation, s, agreements, about, oil, production, and, price, levels, economists, often, cite, opec, as, a, textbook, example, of, a, cartel, that, cooperates, to, reduce, market, competition, as, in, this, definition, from, oecd, s, glossary, of, industrial, organisation, economics, and, competition, law, international, commodity, agreements, covering, products, such, as, coffee, sugar, tin, and, more, recently, oil, opec, organisation, of, petroleum, exporting, countries, are, examples, of, international, cartels, which, have, publicly, entailed, agreements, between, different, national, governments, while, opec, is, at, times, cited, as, a, textbook, example, of, a, cartel, various, authoritative, and, academic, sources, provide, a, broader, perspective, on, the, organization, s, role, for, instance, the, us, energy, information, administration, s, glossary, explains, opec, as, an, intergovernmental, organization, whose, stated, objective, is, to, coordinate, and, unify, the, petroleum, policies, of, member, countries, the, oxford, dictionary, of, energy, science, 2017, defines, opec, as, an, organization, set, up, in, 1960, to, coordinate, petroleum, policies, among, its, member, countries, initially, with, the, aim, of, securing, a, regular, supply, to, consuming, countries, at, a, price, that, gave, a, fair, return, on, capital, investment, opec, members, strongly, prefer, to, describe, their, organisation, as, a, modest, force, for, market, stabilisation, rather, than, a, powerful, anti, competitive, cartel, in, its, defense, the, organisation, was, founded, as, a, counterweight, against, the, previous, seven, sisters, cartel, of, multinational, oil, companies, and, non, opec, energy, suppliers, have, maintained, enough, market, share, for, a, substantial, degree, of, worldwide, competition, moreover, because, of, an, economic, prisoner, s, dilemma, that, encourages, each, member, nation, individually, to, discount, its, price, and, exceed, its, production, quota, widespread, cheating, within, opec, often, erodes, its, ability, to, influence, global, oil, prices, through, collective, action, political, scientist, jeff, colgan, has, challenged, that, opec, is, a, cartel, pointing, to, endemic, cheating, in, the, organization, a, cartel, needs, to, set, tough, goals, and, meet, them, opec, sets, easy, goals, and, fails, to, meet, even, those, opec, has, not, been, involved, in, any, disputes, related, to, the, competition, rules, of, the, world, trade, organization, even, though, the, objectives, actions, and, principles, of, the, two, organisations, diverge, considerably, a, key, us, district, court, decision, held, that, opec, consultations, are, protected, as, governmental, acts, of, state, by, the, foreign, sovereign, immunities, act, and, are, therefore, beyond, the, legal, reach, of, us, competition, law, governing, commercial, acts, despite, popular, sentiment, against, opec, legislative, proposals, to, limit, the, organisation, s, sovereign, immunity, such, as, the, nopec, act, have, so, far, been, unsuccessful, opec, often, has, difficulty, agreeing, on, policy, decisions, because, its, member, countries, differ, widely, in, their, oil, export, capacities, production, costs, reserves, geological, features, population, economic, development, budgetary, situations, and, political, circumstances, indeed, over, the, course, of, market, cycles, oil, reserves, can, themselves, become, a, source, of, serious, conflict, instability, and, imbalances, in, what, economists, call, the, natural, resource, curse, a, further, complication, is, that, religion, linked, conflicts, in, the, middle, east, are, recurring, features, of, the, geopolitical, landscape, for, this, oil, rich, region, internationally, important, conflicts, in, opec, s, history, have, included, the, six, day, war, 1967, yom, kippur, war, 1973, a, hostage, siege, directed, by, palestinian, militants, 1975, the, iranian, revolution, 1979, iran, iraq, war, 1980, 1988, iraqi, occupation, of, kuwait, 1990, 1991, september, 11, attacks, 2001, american, occupation, of, iraq, 2003, 2011, conflict, in, the, niger, delta, 2004, present, arab, spring, 2010, 2012, libyan, crisis, 2011, present, and, international, embargo, against, iran, 2012, 2016, although, events, such, as, these, can, temporarily, disrupt, oil, supplies, and, elevate, prices, the, frequent, disputes, and, instabilities, tend, to, limit, opec, s, long, term, cohesion, and, effectiveness, in, 1949, venezuela, initiated, the, move, towards, the, establishment, of, what, would, become, opec, by, inviting, iran, iraq, kuwait, and, saudi, arabia, to, exchange, views, and, explore, avenues, for, more, regular, and, closer, communication, among, petroleum, exporting, nations, as, the, world, recovered, from, world, war, ii, at, the, time, some, of, the, world, s, largest, oil, fields, were, just, entering, production, in, the, middle, east, the, united, states, had, established, the, interstate, oil, compact, commission, to, join, the, texas, railroad, commission, in, limiting, overproduction, the, us, was, simultaneously, the, world, s, largest, producer, and, consumer, of, oil, the, world, market, was, dominated, by, a, group, of, multinational, companies, known, as, the, seven, sisters, five, of, which, were, headquartered, in, the, us, following, the, breakup, of, john, d, rockefeller, s, original, standard, oil, monopoly, oil, exporting, countries, were, eventually, motivated, to, form, opec, as, a, counterweight, to, this, concentration, of, political, and, economic, power, in, february, 1959, as, new, supplies, were, becoming, available, the, multinational, oil, companies, mocs, unilaterally, reduced, their, posted, prices, for, venezuelan, and, middle, eastern, crude, oil, by, 10, percent, weeks, later, the, arab, league, s, first, arab, petroleum, congress, convened, in, cairo, egypt, where, the, influential, journalist, wanda, jablonski, introduced, saudi, arabia, s, abdullah, tariki, to, venezuela, s, observer, juan, pablo, p, rez, alfonzo, representing, the, two, then, largest, oil, producing, nations, outside, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, both, oil, ministers, were, angered, by, the, price, cuts, and, the, two, led, their, fellow, delegates, to, establish, the, maadi, pact, or, gentlemen, s, agreement, calling, for, an, oil, consultation, commission, of, exporting, countries, to, which, mocs, should, present, price, change, plans, jablonski, reported, a, marked, hostility, toward, the, west, and, a, growing, outcry, against, absentee, landlordism, of, the, mocs, which, at, the, time, controlled, all, oil, operations, within, the, exporting, countries, and, wielded, enormous, political, influence, in, august, 1960, ignoring, the, warnings, and, with, the, us, favoring, canadian, and, mexican, oil, for, strategic, reasons, the, mocs, again, unilaterally, announced, significant, cuts, in, their, posted, prices, for, middle, eastern, crude, oil, the, following, month, during, 10, 14, september, 1960, the, baghdad, conference, was, held, at, the, initiative, of, tariki, p, rez, alfonzo, and, iraqi, prime, minister, abd, al, karim, qasim, whose, country, had, skipped, the, 1959, congress, government, representatives, from, iran, iraq, kuwait, saudi, arabia, and, venezuela, met, in, baghdad, to, discuss, ways, to, increase, the, price, of, crude, oil, produced, by, their, countries, and, ways, to, respond, to, unilateral, actions, by, the, mocs, despite, strong, us, opposition, together, with, arab, and, non, arab, producers, saudi, arabia, formed, the, organization, of, petroleum, export, countries, opec, to, secure, the, best, price, available, from, the, major, oil, corporations, the, middle, eastern, members, originally, called, for, opec, headquarters, to, be, in, baghdad, or, beirut, but, venezuela, argued, for, a, neutral, location, and, so, the, organization, chose, geneva, switzerland, on, 1, september, 1965, opec, moved, to, vienna, austria, after, switzerland, declined, to, extend, diplomatic, privileges, at, the, time, switzerland, was, attempting, to, reduce, their, foreign, population, and, the, opec, was, the, first, intergovernmental, body, to, leave, the, country, because, of, restrictions, on, foreigners, austria, was, keen, to, attract, international, organizations, and, offered, attractive, terms, to, the, opec, during, the, early, years, of, opec, the, oil, producing, countries, had, a, 50, 50, profit, agreement, with, the, oil, companies, opec, bargained, with, the, dominant, oil, companies, the, seven, sisters, but, opec, faced, coordination, problems, among, its, members, if, one, opec, member, demanded, too, much, from, the, oil, companies, then, the, oil, companies, could, slow, down, production, in, that, country, and, ramp, up, production, elsewhere, the, 50, 50, agreements, were, still, in, place, until, 1970, when, libya, negotiated, a, 58, 42, agreement, with, the, oil, company, occidental, which, prompted, other, opec, members, to, request, better, agreements, with, oil, companies, in, 1971, an, accord, was, signed, between, major, oil, companies, and, members, of, opec, doing, business, in, the, mediterranean, sea, region, called, the, tripoli, agreement, the, agreement, signed, on, 2, april, 1971, raised, oil, prices, and, increased, producing, countries, profit, shares, during, 1961, 1975, the, five, founding, nations, were, joined, by, qatar, 1961, indonesia, 1962, 2008, rejoined, 2014, 2016, libya, 1962, united, arab, emirates, originally, just, the, emirate, of, abu, dhabi, 1967, algeria, 1969, nigeria, 1971, ecuador, 1973, 1992, 2007, 2020, and, gabon, 1975, 1994, rejoined, 2016, by, the, early, 1970s, opec, s, membership, accounted, for, more, than, half, of, worldwide, oil, production, indicating, that, opec, is, not, averse, to, further, expansion, mohammed, barkindo, opec, s, acting, secretary, general, in, 2006, urged, his, african, neighbors, angola, and, sudan, to, join, and, angola, did, in, 2007, followed, by, equatorial, guinea, in, 2017, since, the, 1980s, representatives, from, canada, egypt, mexico, norway, oman, russia, and, other, oil, exporting, nations, have, attended, many, opec, meetings, as, observers, as, an, informal, mechanism, for, coordinating, policies, the, oil, market, was, tight, in, the, early, 1970s, which, reduced, the, risks, for, opec, members, in, nationalising, their, oil, production, one, of, the, major, fears, for, opec, members, was, that, nationalisation, would, cause, a, steep, decline, in, the, price, of, oil, this, prompted, a, wave, of, nationalisations, in, countries, such, as, libya, algeria, iraq, nigeria, saudi, arabia, and, venezuela, with, greater, control, over, oil, production, decisions, and, amid, high, oil, prices, opec, members, unilaterally, raised, oil, prices, in, 1973, prompting, the, 1973, oil, crisis, in, october, 1973, the, organisation, of, arab, petroleum, exporting, countries, oapec, consisting, of, the, arab, majority, of, opec, plus, egypt, and, syria, declared, significant, production, cuts, and, an, oil, embargo, against, the, united, states, and, other, industrialized, nations, that, supported, israel, in, the, yom, kippur, war, a, previous, embargo, attempt, was, largely, ineffective, in, response, to, the, six, day, war, in, 1967, however, in, 1973, the, result, was, a, sharp, rise, in, oil, prices, and, opec, revenues, from, us, 3, bbl, to, us, 12, bbl, and, an, emergency, period, of, energy, rationing, intensified, by, panic, reactions, a, declining, trend, in, us, oil, production, currency, devaluations, and, a, lengthy, uk, coal, miners, dispute, for, a, time, the, uk, imposed, an, emergency, three, day, workweek, seven, european, nations, banned, non, essential, sunday, driving, us, gas, stations, limited, the, amount, of, petrol, that, could, be, dispensed, closed, on, sundays, and, restricted, the, days, when, petrol, could, be, purchased, based, on, number, plate, numbers, even, after, the, embargo, ended, in, march, 1974, following, intense, diplomatic, activity, prices, continued, to, rise, the, world, experienced, a, global, economic, recession, with, unemployment, and, inflation, surging, simultaneously, steep, declines, in, stock, and, bond, prices, major, shifts, in, trade, balances, and, petrodollar, flows, and, a, dramatic, end, to, the, post, wwii, economic, boom, the, 1973, 1974, oil, embargo, had, lasting, effects, on, the, united, states, and, other, industrialized, nations, which, established, the, international, energy, agency, in, response, as, well, as, national, emergency, stockpiles, designed, to, withstand, months, of, future, supply, disruptions, oil, conservation, efforts, included, lower, speed, limits, on, highways, smaller, and, more, energy, efficient, cars, and, appliances, year, round, daylight, saving, time, reduced, usage, of, heating, and, air, conditioning, better, building, insulation, increased, support, of, mass, transit, and, greater, emphasis, on, coal, natural, gas, ethanol, nuclear, and, other, alternative, energy, sources, these, long, term, efforts, became, effective, enough, that, us, oil, consumption, rose, only, 11, percent, during, 1980, 2014, while, real, gdp, rose, 150, percent, but, in, the, 1970s, opec, nations, demonstrated, convincingly, that, their, oil, could, be, used, as, both, a, political, and, economic, weapon, against, other, nations, at, least, in, the, short, term, the, embargo, also, meant, that, a, section, of, the, non, aligned, movement, saw, power, as, a, source, of, hope, for, their, developing, countries, the, algerian, president, houari, boum, di, ne, expressed, this, hope, in, a, speech, at, the, un, s, sixth, special, session, in, april, 1974, the, opec, action, is, really, the, first, illustration, and, at, the, same, time, the, most, concrete, and, most, spectacular, illustration, of, the, importance, of, raw, material, prices, for, our, countries, the, vital, need, for, the, producing, countries, to, operate, the, levers, of, price, control, and, lastly, the, great, possibilities, of, a, union, of, raw, material, producing, countries, this, action, should, be, viewed, by, the, developing, countries, as, an, example, and, a, source, of, hope, opec, s, international, aid, activities, date, from, well, before, the, 1973, 1974, oil, price, surge, for, example, the, kuwait, fund, for, arab, economic, development, has, operated, since, 1961, in, the, years, after, 1973, as, an, example, of, so, called, checkbook, diplomacy, certain, arab, nations, have, been, among, the, world, s, largest, providers, of, foreign, aid, and, opec, added, to, its, goals, the, selling, of, oil, for, the, socio, economic, growth, of, poorer, nations, the, opec, special, fund, was, conceived, in, algiers, algeria, in, march, 1975, and, was, formally, established, the, following, january, a, solemn, declaration, reaffirmed, the, natural, solidarity, which, unites, opec, countries, with, other, developing, countries, in, their, struggle, to, overcome, underdevelopment, and, called, for, measures, to, strengthen, cooperation, between, these, countries, resources, are, additional, to, those, already, made, available, by, opec, states, through, a, number, of, bilateral, and, multilateral, channels, the, fund, became, an, official, international, development, agency, in, may, 1980, and, was, renamed, the, opec, fund, for, international, development, with, permanent, observer, status, at, the, united, nations, in, 2020, the, institution, ceased, using, the, abbreviation, ofid, on, 21, december, 1975, saudi, arabia, s, ahmed, zaki, yamani, iran, s, jamshid, amuzegar, and, the, other, opec, oil, ministers, were, taken, hostage, at, their, semi, annual, conference, in, vienna, austria, the, attack, which, killed, three, non, ministers, was, orchestrated, by, a, six, person, team, led, by, venezuelan, terrorist, carlos, the, jackal, and, which, included, gabriele, kr, cher, tiedemann, and, hans, joachim, klein, the, self, named, arm, of, the, arab, revolution, group, declared, its, goal, to, be, the, liberation, of, palestine, carlos, planned, to, take, over, the, conference, by, force, and, hold, for, ransom, all, eleven, attending, oil, ministers, except, for, yamani, and, amuzegar, who, were, to, be, executed, carlos, arranged, bus, and, plane, travel, for, his, team, and, 42, of, the, original, 63, hostages, with, stops, in, algiers, and, tripoli, planning, to, fly, eventually, to, baghdad, where, yamani, and, amuzegar, were, to, be, killed, all, 30, non, arab, hostages, were, released, in, algiers, excluding, amuzegar, additional, hostages, were, released, at, another, stop, in, tripoli, before, returning, to, algiers, with, only, 10, hostages, remaining, carlos, held, a, phone, conversation, with, algerian, president, houari, boum, di, ne, who, informed, carlos, that, the, oil, ministers, deaths, would, result, in, an, attack, on, the, plane, boum, dienne, must, also, have, offered, carlos, asylum, at, this, time, and, possibly, financial, compensation, for, failing, to, complete, his, assignment, carlos, expressed, his, regret, at, not, being, able, to, murder, yamani, and, amuzegar, then, he, and, his, comrades, left, the, plane, all, the, hostages, and, terrorists, walked, away, from, the, situation, two, days, after, it, began, sometime, after, the, attack, carlos, s, accomplices, revealed, that, the, operation, was, commanded, by, wadie, haddad, a, founder, of, the, popular, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, they, also, claimed, that, the, idea, and, funding, came, from, an, arab, president, widely, thought, to, be, muammar, gaddafi, of, libya, itself, an, opec, member, fellow, militants, bassam, abu, sharif, and, klein, claimed, that, carlos, received, and, kept, a, ransom, between, 20, million, and, us, 50, million, from, an, arab, president, carlos, claimed, that, saudi, arabia, paid, ransom, on, behalf, of, iran, but, that, the, money, was, diverted, en, route, and, lost, by, the, revolution, he, was, finally, captured, in, 1994, and, is, serving, life, sentences, for, at, least, 16, other, murders, in, response, to, a, wave, of, oil, nationalizations, and, the, high, prices, of, the, 1970s, industrial, nations, took, steps, to, reduce, their, dependence, on, opec, oil, especially, after, prices, reached, new, peaks, approaching, us, 40, bbl, in, 1979, 1980, when, the, iranian, revolution, and, iran, iraq, war, disrupted, regional, stability, and, oil, supplies, electric, utilities, worldwide, switched, from, oil, to, coal,

opec, oilfields, in, siberia, alaska, the, north, sea, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, by, 1986, daily, worldwide, demand, for, oil, dropped, by, 5, million, barrels, non, opec, production, rose, by, an, even, larger, amount, and, opec, s, market, share, sank, from, approximately, 50, percent, in, 1979, to, less, than, 30, percent, in, 1985, illustrating, the, volatile, multi, year, timeframes, of, typical, market, cycles, for, natural, resources, the, result, was, a, six, year, decline, in, the, price, of, oil, which, culminated, by, plunging, more, than, half, in, 1986, alone, as, one, oil, analyst, summarized, succinctly, when, the, price, of, something, as, essential, as, oil, spikes, humanity, does, two, things, finds, more, of, it, and, finds, ways, to, use, less, of, it, to, combat, falling, revenue, from, oil, sales, in, 1982, saudi, arabia, pressed, opec, for, audited, national, production, quotas, in, an, attempt, to, limit, output, and, boost, prices, when, other, opec, nations, failed, to, comply, saudi, arabia, first, slashed, its, own, production, from, 10, million, barrels, daily, in, 1979, 1981, to, just, one, third, of, that, level, in, 1985, when, even, this, proved, ineffective, saudi, arabia, reversed, course, and, flooded, the, market, with, cheap, oil, causing, prices, to, fall, below, us, 10, bbl, and, higher, cost, producers, to, become, unprofitable, 127, 128, 136, 137, these, strategic, measures, by, saudi, arabia, to, regulate, oil, prices, had, profound, economic, repercussions, as, the, swing, producer, in, that, period, the, kingdom, faced, significant, economic, strain, its, revenues, dramatically, decreased, from, 119, billion, in, 1981, to, 26, billion, by, 1985, leading, to, substantial, budget, deficits, and, a, doubling, of, its, debt, reaching, 100, of, the, gross, domestic, product, 136, 137, faced, with, increasing, economic, hardship, which, ultimately, contributed, to, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, bloc, in, 1989, the, free, riding, oil, exporters, that, had, previously, failed, to, comply, with, opec, agreements, finally, began, to, limit, production, to, shore, up, prices, based, on, painstakingly, negotiated, national, quotas, that, sought, to, balance, oil, related, and, economic, criteria, since, 1986, within, their, sovereign, controlled, territories, the, national, governments, of, opec, members, are, able, to, impose, production, limits, on, both, government, owned, and, private, oil, companies, generally, when, opec, production, targets, are, reduced, oil, prices, increase, leading, up, to, his, august, 1990, invasion, of, kuwait, iraqi, president, saddam, hussein, was, pushing, opec, to, end, overproduction, and, to, send, oil, prices, higher, in, order, to, help, opec, members, financially, and, to, accelerate, rebuilding, from, the, 1980, 1988, iran, iraq, war, but, these, two, iraqi, wars, against, fellow, opec, founders, marked, a, low, point, in, the, cohesion, of, the, organization, and, oil, prices, subsided, quickly, after, the, short, term, supply, disruptions, the, september, 2001, al, qaeda, attacks, on, the, us, and, the, march, 2003, us, invasion, of, iraq, had, even, milder, short, term, impacts, on, oil, prices, as, saudi, arabia, and, other, exporters, again, cooperated, to, keep, the, world, adequately, supplied, in, the, 1990s, opec, lost, its, two, newest, members, who, had, joined, in, the, mid, 1970s, ecuador, withdrew, in, december, 1992, because, it, was, unwilling, to, pay, the, annual, us, 2, million, membership, fee, and, felt, that, it, needed, to, produce, more, oil, than, it, was, allowed, under, the, opec, quota, although, it, rejoined, in, october, 2007, similar, concerns, prompted, gabon, to, suspend, membership, in, january, 1995, it, rejoined, in, july, 2016, iraq, has, remained, a, member, of, opec, since, the, organization, s, founding, but, iraqi, production, was, not, a, part, of, opec, quota, agreements, from, 1998, to, 2016, due, to, the, country, s, daunting, political, difficulties, lower, demand, triggered, by, the, 1997, 1998, asian, financial, crisis, saw, the, price, of, oil, fall, back, to, 1986, levels, after, oil, slumped, to, around, us, 10, bbl, joint, diplomacy, achieved, a, gradual, slowing, of, oil, production, by, opec, mexico, and, norway, after, prices, slumped, again, in, nov, 2001, opec, norway, mexico, russia, oman, and, angola, agreed, to, cut, production, on, 1, january, 2002, for, 6, months, opec, contributed, 1, 5, million, barrels, a, day, mbpd, to, the, approximately, 2, mbpd, of, cuts, announced, in, june, 2003, the, international, energy, agency, iea, and, opec, held, their, first, joint, workshop, on, energy, issues, they, have, continued, to, meet, regularly, since, then, to, collectively, better, understand, trends, analysis, and, viewpoints, and, advance, market, transparency, and, predictability, widespread, insurgency, and, sabotage, occurred, during, the, 2003, 2008, height, of, the, american, occupation, of, iraq, coinciding, with, rapidly, increasing, oil, demand, from, china, and, commodity, hungry, investors, recurring, violence, against, the, nigerian, oil, industry, and, dwindling, spare, capacity, as, a, cushion, against, potential, shortages, this, combination, of, forces, prompted, a, sharp, rise, in, oil, prices, to, levels, far, higher, than, those, previously, targeted, by, opec, price, volatility, reached, an, extreme, in, 2008, as, wti, crude, oil, surged, to, a, record, us, 147, bbl, in, july, and, then, plunged, back, to, us, 32, bbl, in, december, during, the, worst, global, recession, since, world, war, ii, opec, s, annual, oil, export, revenue, also, set, a, new, record, in, 2008, estimated, around, us, 1, trillion, and, reached, similar, annual, rates, in, 2011, 2014, along, with, extensive, petrodollar, recycling, activity, before, plunging, again, by, the, time, of, the, 2011, libyan, civil, war, and, arab, spring, opec, started, issuing, explicit, statements, to, counter, excessive, speculation, in, oil, futures, markets, blaming, financial, speculators, for, increasing, volatility, beyond, market, fundamentals, in, may, 2008, indonesia, announced, that, it, would, leave, opec, when, its, membership, expired, at, the, end, of, that, year, having, become, a, net, importer, of, oil, and, being, unable, to, meet, its, production, quota, a, statement, released, by, opec, on, 10, september, 2008, confirmed, indonesia, s, withdrawal, noting, that, opec, regretfully, accepted, the, wish, of, indonesia, to, suspend, its, full, membership, in, the, organization, and, recorded, its, hope, that, the, country, would, be, in, a, position, to, rejoin, the, organization, in, the, not, too, distant, future, the, differing, economic, needs, of, opec, member, states, often, affect, the, internal, debates, behind, opec, production, quotas, poorer, members, have, pushed, for, production, cuts, from, fellow, members, to, increase, the, price, of, oil, and, thus, their, own, revenues, these, proposals, conflict, with, saudi, arabia, s, stated, long, term, strategy, of, being, a, partner, with, the, world, s, economic, powers, to, ensure, a, steady, flow, of, oil, that, would, support, economic, expansion, part, of, the, basis, for, this, policy, is, the, saudi, concern, that, overly, expensive, oil, or, unreliable, supply, will, drive, industrial, nations, to, conserve, energy, and, develop, alternative, fuels, curtailing, the, worldwide, demand, for, oil, and, eventually, leaving, unneeded, barrels, in, the, ground, to, this, point, saudi, oil, minister, yamani, famously, remarked, in, 1973, the, stone, age, didn, t, end, because, we, ran, out, of, stones, to, elucidate, saudi, arabia, s, contemporary, approach, in, 2024, saudi, energy, minister, prince, abdulaziz, bin, salman, articulated, a, stance, that, reflects, how, the, kingdom, has, adapted, to, the, evolving, economic, needs, within, opec, and, the, broader, international, community, emphasizing, the, need, for, a, balanced, and, fair, global, energy, transition, he, highlighted, the, importance, of, diversifying, energy, sources, and, noted, significant, investments, in, natural, gas, petrochemicals, and, renewables, these, efforts, support, economic, development, in, emerging, countries, and, align, with, global, climate, objectives, additionally, he, addressed, shifting, energy, security, concerns, stating, energy, security, in, the, 70s, 80s, and, 90s, was, more, dependent, on, oil, now, you, get, what, happened, last, year, it, was, gas, the, future, problem, on, energy, security, will, not, be, oil, it, will, be, renewables, and, the, materials, and, the, mines, on, 10, september, 2008, with, oil, prices, still, near, us, 100, bbl, a, production, dispute, occurred, when, the, saudis, reportedly, walked, out, of, a, negotiating, session, where, rival, members, voted, to, reduce, opec, output, although, saudi, delegates, officially, endorsed, the, new, quotas, they, stated, anonymously, that, they, would, not, observe, them, the, new, york, times, quoted, one, such, delegate, as, saying, saudi, arabia, will, meet, the, market, s, demand, we, will, see, what, the, market, requires, and, we, will, not, leave, a, customer, without, oil, the, policy, has, not, changed, over, the, next, few, months, oil, prices, plummeted, into, the, 30s, and, did, not, return, to, 100, until, the, libyan, civil, war, in, 2011, during, 2014, 2015, opec, members, consistently, exceeded, their, production, ceiling, and, china, experienced, a, slowdown, in, economic, growth, at, the, same, time, us, oil, production, nearly, doubled, from, 2008, levels, and, approached, the, world, leading, swing, producer, volumes, of, saudi, arabia, and, russia, due, to, the, substantial, long, term, improvement, and, spread, of, shale, fracking, technology, in, response, to, the, years, of, record, oil, prices, these, developments, led, in, turn, to, a, plunge, in, us, oil, import, requirements, moving, closer, to, energy, independence, a, record, volume, of, worldwide, oil, inventories, and, a, collapse, in, oil, prices, that, continued, into, early, 2016, in, spite, of, global, oversupply, on, 27, november, 2014, in, vienna, saudi, oil, minister, ali, al, naimi, blocked, appeals, from, poorer, opec, members, for, production, cuts, to, support, prices, naimi, argued, that, the, oil, market, should, be, left, to, rebalance, itself, competitively, at, lower, price, levels, strategically, rebuilding, opec, s, long, term, market, share, by, ending, the, profitability, of, high, cost, us, shale, oil, production, as, he, explained, in, an, interview, is, it, reasonable, for, a, highly, efficient, producer, to, reduce, output, while, the, producer, of, poor, efficiency, continues, to, produce, that, is, crooked, logic, if, i, reduce, what, happens, to, my, market, share, the, price, will, go, up, and, the, russians, the, brazilians, us, shale, oil, producers, will, take, my, share, we, want, to, tell, the, world, that, high, efficiency, producing, countries, are, the, ones, that, deserve, market, share, that, is, the, operative, principle, in, all, capitalist, countries, one, thing, is, for, sure, current, prices, do, not, support, all, producers, a, year, later, when, opec, met, in, vienna, on, 4, december, 2015, the, organization, had, exceeded, its, production, ceiling, for, 18, consecutive, months, us, oil, production, had, declined, only, slightly, from, its, peak, world, markets, appeared, to, be, oversupplied, by, at, least, 2, million, barrels, per, day, despite, war, torn, libya, pumping, 1, million, barrels, below, capacity, oil, producers, were, making, major, adjustments, to, withstand, prices, as, low, as, 40, indonesia, was, rejoining, the, export, organization, iraqi, production, had, surged, after, years, of, disorder, iranian, output, was, poised, to, rebound, with, the, lifting, of, international, sanctions, hundreds, of, world, leaders, at, the, paris, climate, agreement, were, committing, to, limit, carbon, emissions, from, fossil, fuels, and, solar, technologies, were, becoming, steadily, more, competitive, and, prevalent, in, light, of, all, these, market, pressures, opec, decided, to, set, aside, its, ineffective, production, ceiling, until, the, next, ministerial, conference, in, june, 2016, by, 20, january, 2016, the, opec, reference, basket, was, down, to, us, 22, 48, bbl, less, than, one, fourth, of, its, high, from, june, 2014, 110, 48, less, than, one, sixth, of, its, record, from, july, 2008, 140, 73, and, back, below, the, april, 2003, starting, point, 23, 27, of, its, historic, run, up, as, 2016, continued, the, oil, glut, was, partially, trimmed, with, significant, production, offline, in, the, united, states, canada, libya, nigeria, and, china, and, the, basket, price, gradually, rose, back, into, the, 40s, opec, regained, a, modest, percentage, of, market, share, saw, the, cancellation, of, many, competing, drilling, projects, maintained, the, status, quo, at, its, june, conference, and, endorsed, prices, at, levels, that, are, suitable, for, both, producers, and, consumers, although, many, producers, were, still, experiencing, serious, economic, difficulties, as, opec, members, grew, weary, of, a, multi, year, supply, contest, with, diminishing, returns, and, shrinking, financial, reserves, the, organization, finally, attempted, its, first, production, cut, since, 2008, despite, many, political, obstacles, a, september, 2016, decision, to, trim, approximately, 1, million, barrels, per, day, was, codified, by, a, new, quota, agreement, at, the, november, 2016, opec, conference, the, agreement, which, exempted, disruption, ridden, members, libya, and, nigeria, covered, the, first, half, of, 2017, alongside, promised, reductions, from, russia, and, ten, other, non, members, offset, by, expected, increases, in, the, us, shale, sector, libya, nigeria, spare, capacity, and, surging, late, 2016, opec, production, before, the, cuts, took, effect, indonesia, announced, another, temporary, suspension, of, its, opec, membership, rather, than, accepting, the, organization, s, requested, 5, percent, production, cut, prices, fluctuated, around, us, 50, bbl, and, in, may, 2017, opec, decided, to, extend, the, new, quotas, through, march, 2018, with, the, world, waiting, to, see, if, and, how, the, oil, inventory, glut, might, be, fully, siphoned, off, by, then, longtime, oil, analyst, daniel, yergin, described, the, relationship, between, opec, and, shale, as, mutual, coexistence, with, both, sides, learning, to, live, with, prices, that, are, lower, than, they, would, like, these, production, cut, deals, with, non, opec, countries, are, generally, referred, to, as, opec, in, december, 2017, russia, and, opec, agreed, to, extend, the, production, cut, of, 1, 8, mbpd, until, the, end, of, 2018, qatar, announced, it, would, withdraw, from, opec, effective, 1, january, 2019, according, to, the, new, york, times, this, was, a, strategic, response, to, the, qatar, diplomatic, crisis, which, qatar, was, involved, with, saudi, arabia, united, arab, emirates, bahrain, and, egypt, on, 29, june, 2019, russia, again, agreed, with, saudi, arabia, to, extend, by, six, to, nine, months, the, original, production, cuts, of, 2018, in, october, 2019, ecuador, announced, it, would, withdraw, from, opec, on, 1, january, 2020, due, to, financial, problems, facing, the, country, in, december, 2019, opec, and, russia, agreed, one, of, the, deepest, output, cuts, so, far, to, prevent, oversupply, in, a, deal, that, will, last, for, the, first, three, months, of, 2020, in, early, march, 2020, opec, officials, presented, an, ultimatum, to, russia, to, cut, production, by, 1, 5, of, world, supply, russia, which, foresaw, continuing, cuts, as, american, shale, oil, production, increased, rejected, the, demand, ending, the, three, year, partnership, between, opec, and, major, non, opec, providers, another, factor, was, weakening, global, demand, resulting, from, the, covid, 19, pandemic, this, also, resulted, in, opec, plus, failing, to, extend, the, agreement, cutting, 2, 1, million, barrels, per, day, that, was, set, to, expire, at, the, end, of, march, saudi, arabia, which, has, absorbed, a, disproportionate, amount, of, the, cuts, to, convince, russia, to, stay, in, the, agreement, notified, its, buyers, on, 7, march, that, they, would, raise, output, and, discount, their, oil, in, april, this, prompted, a, brent, crude, price, crash, of, more, than, 30, before, a, slight, recovery, and, widespread, turmoil, in, financial, markets, several, pundits, saw, this, as, a, saudi, russian, price, war, or, game, of, chicken, which, cause, the, other, side, to, blink, first, saudi, arabia, had, in, march, 2020, 500, billion, of, foreign, exchange, reserves, while, at, that, time, russia, s, reserves, were, 580, billion, the, debt, to, gdp, ratio, of, the, saudis, was, 25, while, the, russian, ratio, was, 15, another, remarked, that, the, saudis, can, produce, oil, at, as, low, a, price, as, 3, per, barrel, whereas, russia, needs, 30, per, barrel, to, cover, production, costs, to, russia, this, price, war, is, more, than, just, about, regaining, market, share, for, oil, one, analyst, claims, it, s, about, assaulting, the, western, economy, especially, america, s, in, order, to, ward, of, from, the, oil, exporters, price, war, which, can, make, shale, oil, production, uneconomical, us, may, protect, its, crude, oil, market, share, by, passing, the, nopec, bill, meanwhile, saudi, arabia, represented, by, energy, minister, prince, abdulaziz, bin, salman, maintains, a, conciliatory, stance, towards, the, u, s, shale, industry, he, clarified, that, harming, this, sector, was, never, their, intention, stating, i, made, it, clear, that, it, was, not, on, our, radar, or, our, intention, to, create, any, type, of, damage, to, their, industry, they, will, rise, again, from, the, ashes, and, thrive, and, prosper, he, also, noted, that, saudi, arabia, is, looking, forward, to, a, time, when, u, s, producers, thrive, once, again, in, a, market, with, higher, oil, demand, in, april, 2020, opec, and, a, group, of, other, oil, producers, including, russia, agreed, to, extend, production, cuts, until, the, end, of, july, the, cartel, and, its, allies, agreed, to, cut, oil, production, in, may, and, june, by, 9, 7, million, barrels, a, day, equal, to, around, 10, of, global, output, in, an, effort, to, prop, up, prices, which, had, previously, fallen, to, record, lows, in, july, 2021, opec, member, united, arab, emirates, rejected, a, saudi, proposed, eight, month, extension, to, oil, output, curbs, which, was, in, place, due, to, covid, 19, and, lower, oil, consumption, the, previous, year, opec, cut, the, equivalent, of, about, 10, of, demand, at, the, time, the, uae, asked, for, the, maximum, amount, of, oil, the, group, would, recognize, the, country, of, producing, to, be, raised, to, 3, 8, million, barrels, a, day, compared, to, its, previous, 3, 2, million, barrels, a, compromise, deal, allowed, uae, to, increase, its, maximum, oil, output, to, 3, 65, million, barrels, a, day, under, the, terms, of, the, agreement, russia, would, increase, its, production, from, 11, million, barrels, to, 11, 5, million, by, may, 2022, as, well, all, members, would, increase, output, by, 400, 000, barrels, per, day, each, month, starting, in, august, to, gradually, offset, the, previous, cuts, made, due, to, the, covid, pandemic, this, compromise, achieved, where, saudi, arabia, met, the, united, arab, emirates, halfway, underscored, opec, unity, uae, energy, minister, suhail, al, mazrouei, thanked, saudi, arabia, and, russia, for, facilitating, dialogue, leading, to, an, agreement, he, stated, the, uae, is, committed, to, this, group, and, will, always, work, with, it, on, the, saudi, side, energy, minister, prince, abdulaziz, bin, salman, emphasized, consensus, building, and, stated, that, the, agreement, strengthens, opec, s, ties, and, ensures, its, continuity, the, record, high, energy, prices, were, driven, by, a, global, surge, in, demand, as, the, world, quit, the, economic, recession, caused, by, covid, 19, particularly, due, to, strong, energy, demand, in, asia, in, august, 2021, u, s, president, joe, biden, s, national, security, adviser, jake, sullivan, released, a, statement, calling, on, opec, to, boost, oil, production, to, offset, previous, production, cuts, that, opec, imposed, during, the, pandemic, until, well, into, 2022, on, 28, september, 2021, sullivan, met, in, saudi, arabia, with, saudi, crown, prince, mohammed, bin, salman, to, discuss, the, high, oil, prices, the, price, of, oil, was, about, us, 80, by, october, 2021, the, highest, since, 2014, president, joe, biden, and, u, s, energy,

more, specifically, to, india, and, china, in, october, 2022, key, opec, ministers, agreed, to, oil, production, cuts, of, 2, million, barrels, per, day, the, first, production, cut, since, 2020, this, led, to, renewed, interest, in, the, passage, of, nopec, in, october, 2022, opec, led, by, saudi, arabia, announced, a, large, cut, to, its, oil, output, target, in, order, to, aid, russia, in,

and, the, 2024, united, states, presidential, election, in, favor, of, donald, trump, in, contrast, saudi, officials, maintain, that, their, decision, to, reduce, oil, production, was, driven, by, concerns, over, the, global, economy, not, political, motivations, they, state, that, the, cuts, were, a, response, to, the, global, economic, situation, and, low, inventories, which, could, trigger, a, rally, in, oil, prices, saudi, arabia, affirms, its, actions, by, emphasizing, its, strategic, partnership, with, the, u, s, focusing, on, peace, security, and, prosperity, in, 2023, the, iea,

other, international, organizations, apec, eurostat, iea, olade, unsd, to, improve, the, availability, and, reliability, of, oil, data, they, launched, the, joint, oil, data, exercise, which, in, 2005, was, joined, by, ief, and, renamed, the, joint, organisations, data, initiative, jodi, covering, more, than, 90, of, the, global, oil, market, gecf, joined, as, an, eighth, partner, in, 2014,

comprehensive, analysis, of, the, global, oil, industry, including, medium, and, long, term, projections, for, supply, and, demand, opec, also, produces, an, annual, statistical, bulletin, asb, and, publishes, more, frequent, updates, in, its, monthly, oil, market, report, momr, and, opec, bulletin, a, crude, oil, benchmark, is, a, standardized, petroleum, product, that, serves, as, a, convenient, reference, price, for, buyers, and, sellers, of, crude, oil, including, standardized, contracts, in, major, futures, markets, since, 1983, benchmarks, are, used, because, oil, prices, differ, usually, by, a, few, dollars, per, barrel, based, on, variety, grade, delivery, date, and, location, and, other, legal, requirements, the, opec, reference, basket, of, crudes, has, been, an, important, benchmark, for, oil, prices, since, 2000, it, is, calculated, as, a, weighted, average, of, prices, for, petroleum, blends, from, the, opec, member, countries, saharan, blend, algeria,

within, 30, days, and, sustained, for, at, least, 90, days, opec, spare, capacity, provides, an, indicator, of, the, world, oil, market, s, ability, to, respond, to, potential, crises, that, reduce, oil, supplies, in, november, 2014, the, international, energy, agency, iea, estimated, that, opec, s, effective, spare, capacity, adjusted, for, ongoing, disruptions, in, countries, like, libya, and, nigeria, was, 3, 5, million, barrels, per, day, 560, 000, m, 3, d, and, that, this, number, would, increase, to, a, peak, in, 2017, of, 4, 6, million, barrels, per, day, 730, 000, m, 3, d, by, november, 2015, the, iea, changed, its, assessment, with, opec, s, spare, production, buffer, stretched, thin, as, saudi, arabia, which, holds, the, lion, s, share, of, excess, capacity, and, its, gulf, neighbours, pump, at, near, record, rates
