https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition
adpositions, are, a, class, of, words, used, to, express, spatial, or, temporal, relations, in, under, towards, behind, ago, etc, or, mark, various, semantic, roles, of, for, the, most, common, adpositions, are, prepositions, which, precede, their, complement, and, postpositions, which, follow, their, complement, an, adposition, typically, combines, with, a, noun, phrase, this, being, called, its, complement, or, sometimes, object, english, generally, has, prepositions, rather, than, postpositions, words, such, as, in, under, and, of, precede, their, objects, such, as, in, england, under, the, table, of, jane, although, there, are, a, few, exceptions, including, ago, and, notwithstanding, as, in, three, days, ago, and, financial, limitations, notwithstanding, some, languages, that, use, a, different, word, order, have, postpositions, instead, like, turkic, languages, or, have, both, types, like, finnish, the, phrase, formed, by, an, adposition, together, with, its, complement, is, called, an, adpositional, phrase, or, prepositional, phrase, postpositional, phrase, etc, such, a, phrase, can, function, as, an, adjective, or, as, an, adverb, a, less, common, type, of, adposition, is, the, circumposition, which, consists, of, two, parts, that, appear, on, each, side, of, the, complement, other, terms, sometimes, used, for, particular, types, of, adposition, include, ambiposition, inposition, and, interposition, some, linguists, use, the, word, preposition, in, place, of, adposition, regardless, of, the, applicable, word, order, the, word, preposition, comes, from, latin, prae, prefix, pre, prefix, before, and, latin, ponere, to, put, this, refers, to, the, situation, in, latin, and, greek, and, in, english, where, such, words, are, placed, before, their, complement, except, sometimes, in, ancient, greek, and, are, hence, pre, positioned, in, some, languages, including, sindhi, hindustani, turkish, hungarian, korean, and, japanese, the, same, kinds, of, words, typically, come, after, their, complement, to, indicate, this, they, are, called, postpositions, using, the, prefix, post, from, latin, post, meaning, behind, after, there, are, also, some, cases, where, the, function, is, performed, by, two, parts, coming, before, and, after, the, complement, this, is, called, a, circumposition, from, latin, circum, prefix, around, in, some, languages, for, example, finnish, some, adpositions, can, be, used, as, both, prepositions, and, postpositions, prepositions, postpositions, and, circumpositions, are, collectively, known, as, adpositions, using, the, latin, prefix, ad, meaning, to, however, some, linguists, prefer, to, use, the, well, known, and, longer, established, term, preposition, in, place, of, adposition, irrespective, of, position, relative, to, the, complement, an, adposition, typically, combines, with, exactly, one, complement, most, often, a, noun, phrase, or, in, a, different, analysis, a, determiner, phrase, in, english, this, is, generally, a, noun, or, something, functioning, as, a, noun, e, g, a, gerund, together, with, its, specifier, and, modifiers, such, as, articles, adjectives, etc, the, complement, is, sometimes, called, the, object, of, the, adposition, the, resulting, phrase, formed, by, the, adposition, together, with, its, complement, is, called, an, adpositional, phrase, or, prepositional, phrase, pp, or, for, specificity, a, postpositional, or, circumpositional, phrase, an, adposition, establishes, a, grammatical, relationship, that, links, its, complement, to, another, word, or, phrase, in, the, context, it, also, generally, establishes, a, semantic, relationship, which, may, be, spatial, in, on, under, temporal, after, during, or, of, some, other, type, of, for, via, the, world, atlas, of, language, structures, treats, a, word, as, an, adposition, if, it, takes, a, noun, phrase, as, a, complement, and, indicates, the, grammatical, or, semantic, relationship, of, that, phrase, to, the, verb, in, the, containing, clause, some, examples, of, the, use, of, english, prepositions, are, given, below, in, each, case, the, prepositional, phrase, appears, in, italics, the, preposition, within, it, appears, in, bold, and, the, preposition, s, complement, is, underlined, as, demonstrated, in, some, of, the, examples, more, than, one, prepositional, phrase, may, act, as, an, adjunct, to, the, same, word, in, the, last, of, these, examples, the, complement, has, the, form, of, an, adverb, which, has, been, nominalised, to, serve, as, a, noun, phrase, see, different, forms, of, complement, below, prepositional, phrases, themselves, are, sometimes, nominalized, an, adposition, may, determine, the, grammatical, case, of, its, complement, in, english, the, complements, of, prepositions, take, the, objective, case, where, available, from, him, not, from, he, in, koine, greek, for, example, certain, prepositions, always, take, their, objects, in, a, certain, case, e, g, always, takes, its, object, in, the, dative, while, other, prepositions, may, take, their, object, in, one, of, two, or, more, cases, depending, on, the, meaning, of, the, preposition, e, g, takes, its, object, in, the, genitive, or, the, accusative, depending, on, the, meaning, some, languages, have, cases, that, are, used, exclusively, after, prepositions, prepositional, case, or, special, forms, of, pronouns, for, use, after, prepositions, prepositional, pronoun, the, functions, of, adpositions, overlap, with, those, of, case, markings, for, example, the, meaning, of, the, english, preposition, of, is, expressed, in, many, languages, by, a, genitive, case, ending, but, adpositions, are, classed, as, syntactic, elements, while, case, markings, are, morphological, adpositions, themselves, are, usually, non, inflecting, invariant, they, do, not, have, paradigms, of, the, form, such, as, tense, case, gender, etc, the, same, way, that, verbs, adjectives, and, nouns, can, there, are, exceptions, though, such, as, prepositions, that, have, fused, with, a, pronominal, object, to, form, inflected, prepositions, the, following, properties, are, characteristic, of, most, adpositional, systems, as, noted, above, adpositions, are, referred, to, by, various, terms, depending, on, their, position, relative, to, the, complement, while, the, term, preposition, sometimes, denotes, any, adposition, its, stricter, meaning, refers, only, to, one, that, precedes, its, complement, examples, of, this, from, english, have, been, given, above, similar, examples, can, be, found, in, many, european, and, other, languages, for, example, in, certain, grammatical, constructions, the, complement, of, a, preposition, may, be, absent, or, may, be, moved, from, its, position, directly, following, the, preposition, this, may, be, referred, to, as, preposition, stranding, see, also, below, as, in, whom, did, you, go, with, and, there, s, only, one, thing, worse, than, being, talked, about, there, are, also, some, mainly, colloquial, expressions, in, which, a, preposition, s, complement, may, be, omitted, such, as, i, m, going, to, the, park, do, you, want, to, come, with, and, the, french, il, fait, trop, froid, je, ne, suis, pas, habill, e, pour, it, s, too, cold, i, m, not, dressed, for, the, bolded, words, in, these, examples, are, generally, still, considered, prepositions, because, when, they, form, a, phrase, with, a, complement, in, more, ordinary, constructions, they, must, appear, first, a, postposition, follows, its, complement, to, form, a, postpositional, phrase, examples, include, some, adpositions, can, appear, either, before, or, after, their, complement, an, adposition, like, the, above, which, can, be, either, a, preposition, or, a, postposition, can, be, called, an, ambiposition, however, ambiposition, may, also, be, used, to, refer, to, a, circumposition, see, below, or, to, a, word, that, appears, to, function, as, a, preposition, and, postposition, simultaneously, as, in, the, vedic, sanskrit, construction, noun, 1, noun, 2, meaning, from, noun, 1, to, noun, 2, whether, a, language, has, primarily, prepositions, or, postpositions, is, seen, as, an, aspect, of, its, typological, classification, and, tends, to, correlate, with, other, properties, related, to, head, directionality, since, an, adposition, is, regarded, as, the, head, of, its, phrase, prepositional, phrases, are, head, initial, or, right, branching, while, postpositional, phrases, are, head, final, or, left, branching, there, is, a, tendency, for, languages, that, feature, postpositions, also, to, have, other, head, final, features, such, as, verbs, that, follow, their, objects, and, for, languages, that, feature, prepositions, to, have, other, head, initial, features, such, as, verbs, that, precede, their, objects, this, is, only, a, tendency, however, an, example, of, a, language, that, behaves, differently, is, latin, which, employs, mostly, prepositions, even, though, it, typically, places, verbs, after, their, objects, a, circumposition, consists, of, two, or, more, parts, positioned, on, both, sides, of, the, complement, circumpositions, are, very, common, in, pashto, and, kurdish, the, following, are, examples, from, northern, kurdish, kurmanji, various, constructions, in, other, languages, might, also, be, analyzed, as, circumpositional, for, example, most, such, phrases, however, can, be, analyzed, as, having, a, different, hierarchical, structure, such, as, a, prepositional, phrase, modifying, a, following, adverb, the, chinese, example, could, be, analyzed, as, a, prepositional, phrase, headed, by, c, ng, from, taking, the, locative, noun, phrase, b, ngx, ang, l, refrigerator, inside, as, its, complement, an, inposition, is, a, rare, type, of, adposition, that, appears, between, parts, of, a, complex, complement, for, example, in, the, native, californian, timbisha, language, the, phrase, from, a, mean, cold, can, be, translated, using, the, word, order, cold, from, mean, the, inposition, follows, the, noun, but, precedes, any, following, modifiers, that, form, part, of, the, same, noun, phrase, the, latin, word, cum, is, also, commonly, used, as, an, inposition, as, in, the, phrase, summa, cum, laude, meaning, with, highest, praise, lit, highest, with, praise, the, term, interposition, has, been, used, for, adpositions, in, structures, such, as, word, for, word, french, coup, sur, coup, one, after, another, repeatedly, and, russian, one, with, the, other, this, is, not, a, case, of, an, adposition, appearing, inside, its, complement, as, the, two, nouns, do, not, form, a, single, phrase, there, is, no, phrase, word, word, for, example, such, uses, have, more, of, a, coordinating, character, preposition, stranding, is, a, syntactic, construct, in, which, a, preposition, occurs, somewhere, other, than, immediately, before, its, complement, for, example, in, the, english, sentence, what, did, you, sit, on, the, preposition, on, has, what, as, its, complement, but, what, is, moved, to, the, start, of, the, sentence, because, it, is, an, interrogative, word, this, sentence, is, much, more, common, and, natural, than, the, equivalent, sentence, without, stranding, on, what, did, you, sit, preposition, stranding, is, commonly, found, in, english, as, well, as, north, germanic, languages, such, as, swedish, its, existence, in, german, is, debated, preposition, stranding, is, also, found, in, some, niger, congo, languages, such, as, vata, and, gbadi, and, in, some, north, american, varieties, of, french, some, prescriptive, english, grammars, teach, that, prepositions, cannot, end, a, sentence, although, there, is, no, rule, prohibiting, that, use, similar, rules, arose, during, the, rise, of, classicism, when, they, were, applied, to, english, in, imitation, of, classical, languages, such, as, latin, otto, jespersen, in, his, essentials, of, english, grammar, first, published, 1933, commented, on, this, definition, derived, rule, nor, need, a, preposition, latin, praepositio, stand, before, the, word, it, governs, go, the, fools, among, sh, what, are, you, laughing, at, you, might, just, as, well, believe, that, all, blackguards, are, black, or, that, turkeys, come, from, turkey, many, names, have, either, been, chosen, unfortunately, at, first, or, have, changed, their, meanings, in, the, course, of, time, simple, adpositions, consist, of, a, single, word, on, in, for, towards, etc, complex, adpositions, consist, of, a, group, of, words, that, act, as, one, unit, examples, of, complex, prepositions, in, english, include, in, spite, of, with, respect, to, except, for, by, dint, of, and, next, to, the, distinction, between, simple, and, complex, adpositions, is, not, clear, cut, many, complex, adpositions, are, derived, from, simple, forms, e, g, with, in, within, by, side, beside, through, grammaticalisation, this, change, takes, time, and, during, the, transitional, stages, the, adposition, acts, in, some, ways, like, a, single, word, and, in, other, ways, like, a, multi, word, unit, for, example, current, german, orthographic, conventions, recognize, the, indeterminate, status, of, certain, prepositions, allowing, two, spellings, anstelle, an, stelle, instead, of, aufgrund, auf, grund, because, of, mithilfe, mit, hilfe, by, means, of, zugunsten, zu, gunsten, in, favor, of, zuungunsten, zu, ungunsten, to, the, disadvantage, of, zulasten, zu, lasten, at, the, expense, of, the, distinction, between, complex, adpositions, and, free, combinations, of, words, is, not, a, black, and, white, issue, complex, adpositions, in, english, prepositional, idioms, can, be, more, fossilized, or, less, fossilized, in, english, this, applies, to, a, number, of, structures, of, the, form, preposition, article, noun, preposition, such, as, in, front, of, for, the, sake, of, the, following, characteristics, are, good, indications, that, a, given, combination, is, frozen, enough, to, be, considered, a, complex, preposition, in, english, marginal, prepositions, are, prepositions, that, have, affinities, with, other, word, classes, most, notably, participles, marginal, prepositions, behave, like, prepositions, but, derive, from, other, parts, of, speech, some, marginal, prepositions, in, english, include, barring, concerning, considering, excluding, failing, following, including, notwithstanding, regarding, and, respecting, in, descriptions, of, some, languages, prepositions, are, divided, into, proper, or, essential, and, improper, or, accidental, a, preposition, is, called, improper, if, it, is, some, other, part, of, speech, being, used, in, the, same, way, as, a, preposition, examples, of, simple, and, complex, prepositions, that, have, been, so, classified, include, prima, di, before, and, davanti, a, in, front, of, in, italian, and, ergo, on, account, of, and, causa, for, the, sake, of, in, latin, in, reference, to, ancient, greek, however, an, improper, preposition, is, one, that, cannot, also, serve, as, a, prefix, to, a, verb, as, noted, above, adpositions, typically, have, noun, phrases, as, complements, this, can, include, nominal, clauses, and, certain, types, of, non, finite, verb, phrase, the, word, to, when, it, precedes, the, infinitive, in, english, is, not, a, preposition, but, rather, is, a, grammatical, particle, outside, of, any, main, word, class, in, other, cases, the, complement, may, have, the, form, of, an, adjective, or, adjective, phrase, or, an, adverbial, this, may, be, regarded, as, a, complement, representing, a, different, syntactic, category, or, simply, as, an, atypical, form, of, noun, phrase, see, nominalization, in, the, last, example, the, complement, of, the, preposition, from, is, in, fact, another, prepositional, phrase, the, resulting, sequence, of, two, prepositions, from, under, may, be, regarded, as, a, complex, preposition, in, some, languages, such, a, sequence, may, be, represented, by, a, single, word, as, russian, iz, pod, from, under, some, adpositions, appear, to, combine, with, two, complements, it, is, more, commonly, assumed, however, that, sammy, and, the, following, predicate, forms, a, small, clause, which, then, becomes, the, single, complement, of, the, preposition, in, the, first, example, a, word, such, as, as, may, be, considered, to, have, been, elided, which, if, present, would, clarify, the, grammatical, relationship, adpositions, can, be, used, to, express, a, wide, range, of, semantic, relations, between, their, complement, and, the, rest, of, the, context, the, relations, expressed, may, be, spatial, denoting, location, or, direction, temporal, denoting, position, in, time, or, relations, expressing, comparison, content, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, purpose, reference, etc, most, common, adpositions, are, highly, polysemous, they, have, various, different, meanings, in, many, cases, a, primary, spatial, meaning, becomes, extended, to, non, spatial, uses, by, metaphorical, or, other, processes, because, of, the, variety, of, meanings, a, single, adposition, often, has, many, possible, equivalents, in, another, language, depending, on, the, exact, context, this, can, cause, difficulties, in, foreign, language, learning, usage, can, also, vary, between, dialects, of, the, same, language, for, example, american, english, has, on, the, weekend, whereas, british, english, uses, at, the, weekend, in, some, contexts, as, in, the, case, of, some, phrasal, verbs, the, choice, of, adposition, may, be, determined, by, another, element, in, the, construction, or, be, fixed, by, the, construction, as, a, whole, here, the, adposition, may, have, little, independent, semantic, content, of, its, own, and, there, may, be, no, clear, reason, why, the, particular, adposition, is, used, rather, than, another, examples, of, such, expressions, are, prepositions, sometimes, mark, roles, that, may, be, considered, largely, grammatical, spatial, meanings, of, adpositions, may, be, either, directional, or, static, a, directional, meaning, usually, involves, motion, in, a, particular, direction, kay, went, to, the, store, the, direction, in, which, something, leads, or, points, a, path, into, the, woods, or, the, extent, of, something, the, fog, stretched, from, london, to, paris, a, static, meaning, indicates, only, a, location, at, the, store, behind, the, chair, on, the, moon, some, prepositions, can, have, both, uses, he, sat, in, the, water, static, he, jumped, in, the, water, probably, directional, in, some, languages, the, case, of, the, complement, varies, depending, on, the, meaning, as, with, several, prepositions, in, german, such, as, in, in, english, and, many, other, languages, prepositional, phrases, with, static, meaning, are, commonly, used, as, predicative, expressions, after, a, copula, bob, is, at, the, store, this, may, happen, with, some, directional, prepositions, as, well, bob, is, from, australia, but, this, is, less, common, directional, prepositional, phrases, combine, mostly, with, verbs, that, indicate, movement, jay, is, going, into, her, bedroom, but, not, jay, is, lying, down, into, her, bedroom, directional, meanings, can, be, further, divided, into, telic, and, atelic, telic, prepositional, phrases, imply, movement, all, the, way, to, the, endpoint, she, ran, to, the, fence, while, atelic, ones, do, not, she, ran, towards, the, fence, static, meanings, can, be, divided, into, projective, and, non, projective, where, projective, meanings, are, those, whose, understanding, requires, knowledge, of, the, perspective, or, point, of, view, for, example, the, meaning, of, behind, the, rock, is, likely, to, depend, on, the, position, of, the, speaker, projective, whereas, the, meaning, of, on, the, desk, is, not, non, projective, sometimes, the, interpretation, is, ambiguous, as, in, behind, the, house, which, may, mean, either, at, the, natural, back, of, the, house, or, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, house, from, the, speaker, some, languages, feature, inflected, adpositions, adpositions, usually, prepositions, marked, for, grammatical, person, and, or, grammatical, number, to, give, meanings, such, as, on, me, from, you, etc, in, the, indo, european, languages, this, phenomenon, is, mostly, confined, to, the, celtic, languages, like, welsh, and, irish, polish, also, allows, some, degree, of, combining, prepositions, with, pronouns, in, the, third, person, the, majority, of, welsh, prepositions, can, be, inflected, this, is, achieved, by, having, a, preposition, such, as, o, of, from, a, linking, element, in, the, case, of, o, this, is, hon, the, assimilated, pronoun, element, resulting, in, ohon, being, the, preposition, s, stem, form, it, is, common, in, speech, for, the, pronoun, to, be, present, after, the, preposition, but, it, can, be, omitted, unless, used, with, a, pronoun, the, form, is, always, o, and, not, the, stem, e, g, dw, i, n, dod, o, gymru, i, come, from, wales, gormod, o, gwrw, too, much, of, beer, the, following, table, gives, the, inflected, forms, of, the, preposition, o, of, from, the, optional, pronouns, that, follow, the, inflected, forms, are, given, in, parentheses, cymerodd, ef, hi, ohonof, he, took, it, from, me, inflected, prepositions, are, found, in, semitic, languages, including, hebrew, arabic, assyrian, neo, aramaic, and, amharic, for, example, the, arabic, preposition, ala, on, inflects, as, alaj, a, on, me, alajka, on, you, m, sg, alajhi, on, him, etc, some, iranic, languages, including, persian, have, developed, inflected, prepositions, for, example, persian, az, u, from, him, her, becomes, aza, b, om, with, you, pl, becomes, b, h, tun, in, iberian, romance, languages, such, as, spanish, and, portuguese, the, preposition, con, or, com, with, has, special, forms, incorporating, certain, pronouns, depending, on, the, language, for, example, in, spanish, and, asturian, conmigo, means, with, me, historically, this, developed, from, the, latin, use, of, cum, with, after, a, pronoun, as, in, mecum, with, me, bororo, an, indigenous, language, of, brazil, uses, postpositions, in, all, contexts, tori, ji, about, the, mountains, when, these, modify, a, pronoun, rather, than, a, full, noun, the, phrase, contracts, into, an, inflected, postposition, and, therefore, looks, like, a, pronominal, prefix, rather, than, a, suffix, as, in, the, examples, above, bagai, for, i, wagai, for, me, there, are, often, similarities, in, form, between, adpositions, and, adverbs, some, adverbs, are, derived, from, the, fusion, of, a, preposition, and, its, complement, such, as, downstairs, from, down, the, stairs, and, underground, from, under, the, ground, some, words, can, function, both, as, adverbs, and, as, prepositions, such, as, inside, aboard, underneath, for, instance, one, can, say, go, inside, with, adverbial, use, or, go, inside, the, house, with, prepositional, use, such, cases, are, analogous, to, verbs, that, can, be, used, either, transitively, or, intransitively, and, the, adverbial, forms, might, therefore, be, analyzed, as, intransitive, prepositions, this, analysis, could, also, be, extended, to, other, adverbs, such, as, here, this, place, there, that, place, afterward, etc, even, though, these, never, take, complements, many, english, phrasal, verbs, contain, particles, that, are, used, adverbially, even, though, they, mostly, have, the, form, of, a, preposition, such, words, may, be, called, prepositional, adverbs, examples, are, on, in, carry, on, get, on, etc, and, over, in, take, over, fall, over, and, so, on, the, equivalents, in, dutch, and, german, are, separable, prefixes, which, also, often, have, the, same, form, as, prepositions, for, example, dutch, aanbieden, and, german, anbieten, both, meaning, to, offer, contain, the, separable, prefix, aan, an, which, is, also, a, preposition, meaning, on, or, to, some, words, can, be, used, both, as, adpositions, and, as, subordinating, conjunctions, it, would, be, possible, to, analyze, such, conjunctions, or, even, other, subordinating, conjunctions, as, prepositions, that, take, an, entire, clause, as, a, complement, in, some, languages, including, a, number, of, chinese, varieties, many, of, the, words, that, serve, as, prepositions, can, also, be, used, as, verbs, for, instance, in, standard, chinese, d, o, can, be, used, in, either, a, prepositional, or, a, verbal, sense, because, of, this, overlap, and, the, fact, that, a, sequence, of, prepositional, phrases, and, verb, phrases, often, resembles, a, serial, verb, construction, chinese, prepositions, and, those, of, other, languages, with, similar, grammatical, structures, are, often, referred, to, as, coverbs, as, noted, in, previous, sections, chinese, can, also, be, said, to, have, postpositions, although, these, can, be, analyzed, as, nominal, noun, elements, for, more, information, see, the, article, on, chinese, grammar, particularly, the, sections, on, coverbs, and, locative, phrases, some, grammatical, case, markings, have, a, similar, function, to, adpositions, a, case, affix, in, one, language, may, be, equivalent, in, meaning, to, a, preposition, or, postposition, in, another, for, example, in, english, the, agent, of, a, passive, construction, is, marked, by, the, preposition, by, while, in, russian, it, is, marked, by, the, use, of, the, instrumental, case, sometimes, such, equivalences, exist, within, a, single, language, for, example, the, genitive, case, in, german, is, often, interchangeable, with, a, phrase, using, the, preposition, von, just, as, in, english, the, preposition, of, is, often, interchangeable, with, the, possessive, suffix, s, adpositions, combine, syntactically, with, their, complement, whereas, case, markings, combine, with, a, noun, morphologically, in, some, instances, it, may, not, be, clear, which, applies, the, following, are, some, possible, means, of, making, such, a, distinction, even, so, a, clear, distinction, cannot, always, be, made, for, example, the, post, nominal, elements, in, japanese, and, korean, are, sometimes, called, case, particles, and, sometimes, postpositions, sometimes, they, are, analyzed, as, two, different, groups, because, they, have, different, characteristics, e, g, the, ability, to, combine, with, focus, particles, but, in, such, analysis, it, is, unclear, which, words, should, fall, into, which, group, turkish, finnish, and, hungarian, have, both, extensive, case,
