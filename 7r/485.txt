quechua, k, t, u, spanish, also, called, runasimi, people, s, language, in, southern, quechua, is, an, indigenous, language, family, that, originated, in, central, peru, and, thereafter, spread, to, other, countries, of, the, andes, derived, from, a, common, ancestral, proto, quechua, language, it, is, today, the, most, widely, spoken, pre, columbian, language, family, of, the, americas, with, the, number, of, speakers, estimated, at, 8, 10, million, speakers, in, 2004, and, just, under, 7, million, from, the, most, recent, census, data, available, up, to, 2011, approximately, 13, 9, 3, 7, million, of, peruvians, speak, a, quechua, language, although, quechua, began, expanding, many, centuries, before, the, incas, that, previous, expansion, also, meant, that, it, was, the, primary, language, family, within, the, inca, empire, the, spanish, also, tolerated, its, use, until, the, peruvian, struggle, for, independence, in, the, 1780s, as, a, result, various, quechua, languages, are, still, widely, spoken, today, being, co, official, in, many, regions, and, the, most, spoken, language, lineage, in, peru, after, spanish, the, quechua, linguistic, homeland, may, have, been, central, peru, it, has, been, speculated, that, it, may, have, been, used, in, the, chav, n, and, wari, civilizations, quechua, had, already, expanded, across, wide, ranges, of, the, central, andes, long, before, the, expansion, of, the, inca, empire, the, inca, were, one, among, many, peoples, in, present, day, peru, who, already, spoke, a, form, of, quechua, which, in, the, cuzco, region, particularly, has, been, heavily, influenced, by, aymara, hence, some, of, the, characteristics, that, still, distinguish, the, cuzco, form, of, quechua, today, diverse, quechua, regional, dialects, and, languages, had, already, developed, in, different, areas, influenced, by, local, languages, before, the, inca, empire, expanded, and, further, promoted, quechua, as, the, official, language, of, the, empire, after, the, spanish, conquest, of, peru, in, the, 16th, century, quechua, continued, to, be, used, widely, by, the, indigenous, peoples, as, the, common, language, it, was, officially, recognized, by, the, spanish, administration, and, many, spaniards, learned, it, in, order, to, communicate, with, local, peoples, the, clergy, of, the, catholic, church, adopted, quechua, to, use, as, the, language, of, evangelization, the, oldest, written, records, of, the, language, are, by, missionary, domingo, de, santo, tom, s, who, arrived, in, peru, in, 1538, and, learned, the, language, from, 1540, he, published, his, grammatica, o, arte, de, la, lengua, general, de, los, indios, de, los, reynos, del, per, grammar, or, art, of, the, general, language, of, the, indians, of, the, kingdoms, of, peru, in, 1560, given, its, use, by, the, catholic, missionaries, the, range, of, quechua, continued, to, expand, in, some, areas, in, the, late, 18th, century, colonial, officials, ended, the, administrative, and, religious, use, of, quechua, they, banned, it, from, public, use, in, peru, after, the, t, pac, amaru, ii, rebellion, of, indigenous, peoples, the, crown, banned, loyal, pro, catholic, texts, in, quechua, such, as, garcilaso, de, la, vega, s, comentarios, reales, despite, a, brief, revival, of, the, language, immediately, after, the, latin, american, nations, achieved, independence, in, the, 19th, century, the, prestige, of, quechua, had, decreased, sharply, gradually, its, use, declined, so, that, it, was, spoken, mostly, by, indigenous, people, in, the, more, isolated, and, conservative, rural, areas, nevertheless, in, the, 21st, century, quechua, language, speakers, number, roughly, 7, million, people, across, south, america, more, than, any, other, indigenous, language, family, in, the, americas, as, a, result, of, inca, expansion, into, central, chile, there, were, bilingual, quechua, mapudungu, mapuche, in, central, chile, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, arrival, it, has, been, argued, that, mapuche, quechua, and, spanish, coexisted, in, central, chile, with, significant, bilingualism, during, the, 17th, century, alongside, mapudungun, quechua, is, the, indigenous, language, that, has, influenced, chilean, spanish, the, most, quechua, aymara, and, mixed, quechua, aymara, mapudungu, toponymy, can, be, found, as, far, south, as, osorno, province, in, chile, latitude, 41, s, in, 2017, the, first, thesis, defense, done, in, quechua, in, europe, was, done, by, peruvian, carmen, escalante, guti, rrez, at, pablo, de, olavide, university, sevilla, the, same, year, pablo, landeo, wrote, the, first, novel, in, quechua, without, a, spanish, translation, a, peruvian, student, roxana, quispe, collantes, of, the, university, of, san, marcos, completed, and, defended, the, first, thesis, in, the, language, group, in, 2019, it, concerned, the, works, of, poet, andr, s, alencastre, guti, rrez, and, it, was, also, the, first, non, spanish, native, language, thesis, done, at, that, university, currently, there, are, different, initiatives, that, promote, quechua, in, the, andes, and, across, the, world, many, universities, offer, quechua, classes, a, community, based, organization, such, as, elva, amb, a, s, quechua, collective, of, new, york, promote, the, language, and, governments, are, training, interpreters, in, quechua, to, serve, in, healthcare, justice, and, bureaucratic, facilities, in, 1975, peru, became, the, first, country, to, recognize, quechua, as, one, of, its, official, languages, ecuador, conferred, official, status, on, the, language, in, its, 2006, constitution, and, in, 2009, bolivia, adopted, a, new, constitution, that, recognized, quechua, and, several, other, indigenous, languages, as, official, languages, of, the, country, the, major, obstacle, to, the, usage, and, teaching, of, quechua, languages, is, the, lack, of, written, materials, such, as, books, newspapers, software, and, magazines, the, bible, has, been, translated, into, quechua, and, is, distributed, by, certain, missionary, groups, quechua, along, with, aymara, and, minor, indigenous, languages, remains, essentially, a, spoken, language, in, recent, years, quechua, has, been, introduced, in, intercultural, bilingual, education, ibe, in, peru, bolivia, and, ecuador, even, in, these, areas, the, governments, are, reaching, only, a, part, of, the, quechua, speaking, populations, some, indigenous, people, in, each, of, the, countries, are, having, their, children, study, in, spanish, for, social, advancement, radio, nacional, del, per, broadcasts, news, and, agrarian, programs, in, quechua, for, periods, in, the, mornings, quechua, and, spanish, are, now, heavily, intermixed, in, much, of, the, andean, region, with, many, hundreds, of, spanish, loanwords, in, quechua, similarly, quechua, phrases, and, words, are, commonly, used, by, spanish, speakers, in, southern, rural, bolivia, for, instance, many, quechua, words, such, as, wawa, infant, misi, cat, waska, strap, or, thrashing, are, as, commonly, used, as, their, spanish, counterparts, even, in, entirely, spanish, speaking, areas, quechua, has, also, had, a, significant, influence, on, other, native, languages, of, the, americas, such, as, mapuche, it, is, difficult, to, measure, the, number, of, quechua, speakers, the, number, of, speakers, given, varies, widely, according, to, the, sources, the, total, in, ethnologue, 16, is, 10, million, primarily, based, on, figures, published, 1987, 2002, but, with, a, few, dating, from, the, 1960s, the, figure, for, imbabura, highland, quechua, in, ethnologue, for, example, is, 300, 000, an, estimate, from, 1977, the, missionary, organization, fedepi, on, the, other, hand, estimated, one, million, imbabura, dialect, speakers, published, 2006, census, figures, are, also, problematic, due, to, under, reporting, the, 2001, ecuador, census, reports, only, 500, 000, quechua, speakers, compared, to, the, estimate, in, most, linguistic, sources, of, more, than, 2, million, the, censuses, of, peru, 2007, and, bolivia, 2001, are, thought, to, be, more, reliable, additionally, there, is, an, unknown, number, of, speakers, in, emigrant, communities, there, are, significant, differences, among, the, varieties, of, quechua, spoken, in, the, central, peruvian, highlands, and, the, peripheral, varieties, of, ecuador, as, well, as, those, of, southern, peru, and, bolivia, they, can, be, labeled, quechua, i, or, quechua, b, central, and, quechua, ii, or, quechua, a, peripheral, within, the, two, groups, there, are, few, sharp, boundaries, making, them, dialect, continua, however, there, is, a, secondary, division, in, quechua, ii, between, the, grammatically, simplified, northern, varieties, of, ecuador, quechua, ii, b, known, there, as, kichwa, and, the, generally, more, conservative, varieties, of, the, southern, highlands, quechua, ii, c, which, include, the, old, inca, capital, of, cusco, the, closeness, is, at, least, in, part, because, of, the, influence, of, cusco, quechua, on, the, ecuadorean, varieties, in, the, inca, empire, because, northern, nobles, were, required, to, educate, their, children, in, cusco, this, was, maintained, as, the, prestige, dialect, in, the, north, speakers, from, different, points, within, any, of, the, three, regions, can, generally, understand, one, another, reasonably, well, there, are, nonetheless, significant, local, level, differences, across, each, wanka, quechua, in, particular, has, several, very, distinctive, characteristics, that, make, the, variety, more, challenging, to, understand, even, for, other, central, quechua, speakers, speakers, from, different, major, regions, particularly, central, or, southern, quechua, are, not, able, to, communicate, effectively, the, lack, of, mutual, intelligibility, among, the, dialects, is, the, basic, criterion, that, defines, quechua, not, as, a, single, language, but, as, a, language, family, the, complex, and, progressive, nature, of, how, speech, varies, across, the, dialect, continua, makes, it, nearly, impossible, to, differentiate, discrete, varieties, ethnologue, lists, 45, varieties, which, are, then, divided, into, two, groups, central, and, peripheral, due, to, the, non, intelligibility, between, the, two, groups, they, are, all, classified, as, separate, languages, as, a, reference, point, the, overall, degree, of, diversity, across, the, family, is, a, little, less, than, that, of, the, romance, or, germanic, families, and, more, of, the, order, of, slavic, or, arabic, the, greatest, diversity, is, within, central, quechua, or, quechua, i, which, is, believed, to, lie, close, to, the, homeland, of, the, ancestral, proto, quechua, language, alfredo, torero, devised, the, traditional, classification, the, three, divisions, above, plus, a, fourth, a, northern, or, peruvian, branch, the, latter, causes, complications, in, the, classification, however, as, various, dialects, e, g, cajamarca, ca, aris, pacaraos, and, yauyos, have, features, of, both, quechua, i, and, quechua, ii, and, so, are, difficult, to, assign, to, either, torero, classifies, them, as, the, following, willem, adelaar, adheres, to, the, quechua, i, quechua, ii, central, peripheral, bifurcation, but, partially, following, later, modifications, by, torero, he, reassigns, part, of, quechua, ii, a, to, quechua, i, ancash, huaylas, conchucos, alto, pativilca, alto, mara, n, alto, huallaga, yaru, wanka, jauja, huanca, yauyos, chincha, huang, scar, topar, pacaraos, lambayeque, ca, aris, cajamarca, lincha, laraos, kichwa, ecuadorian, or, highlands, and, oriente, chachapoyas, amazonas, lamas, san, mart, n, ayacucho, cusco, puno, collao, northern, bolivian, apolo, southern, bolivia, santiago, del, estero, landerman, 1991, does, not, believe, a, true, genetic, classification, is, possible, and, divides, quechua, ii, so, that, the, family, has, four, geographical, typological, branches, northern, north, peruvian, central, and, southern, he, includes, chachapoyas, and, lamas, in, north, peruvian, quechua, so, ecuadorian, is, synonymous, with, northern, quechua, quechua, i, central, quechua, waywash, is, spoken, in, peru, s, central, highlands, from, the, ancash, region, to, huancayo, it, is, the, most, diverse, branch, of, quechua, to, the, extent, that, its, divisions, are, commonly, considered, different, languages, quechua, ii, peripheral, quechua, wamp, una, traveler, this, is, a, sampling, of, words, in, several, quechuan, languages, quechua, shares, a, large, amount, of, vocabulary, and, some, striking, structural, parallels, with, aymara, and, the, two, families, have, sometimes, been, grouped, together, as, a, quechumaran, family, this, hypothesis, is, generally, rejected, by, specialists, however, the, parallels, are, better, explained, by, mutual, influence, and, borrowing, through, intensive, and, long, term, contact, many, quechua, aymara, cognates, are, close, often, closer, than, intra, quechua, cognates, and, there, is, a, little, relationship, in, the, affixal, system, the, puquina, language, of, the, tiwanaku, empire, is, a, possible, source, for, some, of, the, shared, vocabulary, between, quechua, and, aymara, jolkesky, 2016, notes, that, there, are, lexical, similarities, with, the, kunza, leko, mapudungun, mochika, uru, chipaya, zaparo, arawak, kandoshi, muniche, pukina, pano, barbakoa, cholon, hibito, jaqi, jivaro, and, kawapana, language, families, due, to, contact, quechua, has, borrowed, a, large, number, of, spanish, words, such, as, piru, from, pero, but, bwenu, from, bueno, good, iskwila, from, escuela, school, waka, from, vaca, cow, and, wuru, from, burro, donkey, a, number, of, quechua, words, have, entered, english, and, french, via, spanish, including, coca, condor, guano, jerky, llama, pampa, poncho, puma, quinine, quinoa, vicu, a, vigogne, in, french, and, possibly, gaucho, the, word, lagniappe, comes, from, the, quechuan, word, yapay, to, increase, to, add, the, word, first, came, into, spanish, then, louisiana, french, with, the, french, or, spanish, article, la, in, front, of, it, la, apa, in, louisiana, french, or, creole, or, la, yapa, in, spanish, a, rare, instance, of, a, quechua, word, being, taken, into, general, spanish, use, is, given, by, carpa, for, tent, quechua, karpa, the, quechua, influence, on, latin, american, spanish, includes, such, borrowings, as, papa, potato, chuchaqui, hangover, in, ecuador, and, diverse, borrowings, for, altitude, sickness, suruqch, i, in, bolivia, sorojchi, in, ecuador, and, soroche, in, peru, in, bolivia, particularly, quechua, words, are, used, extensively, even, by, non, quechua, speakers, these, include, wawa, baby, infant, ch, aki, hangover, misi, cat, juk, ucho, mouse, q, omer, uchu, green, pepper, jacu, let, s, go, chhiri, and, chhurco, curly, haired, among, many, others, quechua, grammar, also, enters, bolivian, spanish, such, as, the, use, of, the, suffix, ri, in, bolivian, quechua, ri, is, added, to, verbs, to, signify, an, action, is, performed, with, affection, or, in, the, imperative, as, a, rough, equivalent, to, please, in, bolivia, ri, is, often, included, in, the, spanish, imperative, to, imply, please, or, to, soften, commands, for, example, the, standard, p, same, pass, me, becomes, pasarime, at, first, spaniards, referred, to, the, language, of, the, inca, empire, as, the, lengua, general, the, general, tongue, the, name, quichua, was, first, used, in, 1560, by, domingo, de, santo, tom, s, in, his, grammatica, o, arte, de, la, lengua, general, de, los, indios, de, los, reynos, del, per, it, is, not, known, what, name, the, native, speakers, gave, to, their, language, before, colonial, times, and, whether, it, was, spaniards, who, called, it, quechua, there, are, two, possible, etymologies, of, quechua, as, the, name, of, the, language, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, name, quechua, was, derived, from, qi, wa, the, native, word, which, originally, meant, the, temperate, valley, altitude, ecological, zone, in, the, andes, suitable, for, maize, cultivation, and, to, its, inhabitants, alternatively, pedro, cieza, de, le, n, and, inca, garcilaso, de, la, vega, the, early, spanish, chroniclers, mention, the, existence, of, a, people, called, quichua, in, the, present, apur, mac, region, and, it, could, be, inferred, that, their, name, was, given, to, the, entire, language, the, hispanicised, spellings, quechua, and, quichua, have, been, used, in, peru, and, bolivia, since, the, 17th, century, especially, after, the, third, council, of, lima, today, the, various, local, pronunciations, of, quechua, simi, include, and, another, name, that, native, speakers, give, to, their, own, language, is, runa, simi, language, of, man, people, it, also, seems, to, have, emerged, during, the, colonial, period, the, description, below, applies, to, cuzco, quechua, there, are, significant, differences, in, other, varieties, of, quechua, quechua, only, has, three, vowel, phonemes, a, i, and, u, with, no, diphthongs, as, in, aymara, including, jaqaru, monolingual, speakers, pronounce, them, as, respectively, but, spanish, realizations, may, also, be, found, when, the, vowels, appear, adjacent, to, uvular, consonants, q, q, and, q, they, are, rendered, more, like, respectively, gemination, of, the, tap, results, in, a, trill, about, 30, of, the, modern, quechua, vocabulary, is, borrowed, from, spanish, and, some, spanish, sounds, such, as, f, b, d, may, have, become, phonemic, even, among, monolingual, quechua, speakers, voicing, is, not, phonemic, in, cusco, quechua, cusco, quechua, north, bolivian, quechua, and, south, bolivian, quechua, are, the, only, varieties, to, have, glottalized, consonants, they, along, with, certain, kinds, of, ecuadorian, kichwa, are, the, only, varieties, which, have, aspirated, consonants, because, reflexes, of, a, given, proto, quechua, word, may, have, different, stops, in, neighboring, dialects, proto, quechua, aki, foot, becomes, aki, and, proto, quechua, aka, bridge, becomes, aka, they, are, thought, to, be, innovations, in, quechua, from, aymara, borrowed, independently, after, branching, off, from, proto, quechua, stress, is, penultimate, in, most, dialects, of, quechua, in, some, varieties, factors, such, as, the, apocope, of, word, final, vowels, may, cause, exceptional, final, stress, stress, in, chachapoyas, quechua, falls, word, initially, quechua, has, been, written, using, the, roman, alphabet, since, the, spanish, conquest, of, peru, however, written, quechua, is, rarely, used, by, quechua, speakers, due, to, limited, amounts, of, printed, material, in, the, language, until, the, 20th, century, quechua, was, written, with, a, spanish, based, orthography, for, example, inca, huayna, c, pac, collasuyo, mama, ocllo, viracocha, quipu, tambo, condor, this, orthography, is, the, most, familiar, to, spanish, speakers, and, so, it, has, been, used, for, most, borrowings, into, english, which, essentially, always, happen, through, spanish, in, 1975, the, peruvian, government, of, juan, velasco, alvarado, adopted, a, new, orthography, for, quechua, this, is, the, system, preferred, by, the, academia, mayor, de, la, lengua, quechua, which, results, in, the, following, spellings, of, the, examples, listed, above, inka, wayna, qhapaq, qollasuyu, mama, oqllo, wiraqocha, khipu, tampu, kuntur, this, orthography, has, the, following, features, in, 1985, a, variation, of, this, system, was, adopted, by, the, peruvian, government, that, uses, the, quechuan, three, vowel, system, resulting, in, the, following, spellings, inka, wayna, qhapaq, qullasuyu, mama, uqllu, wiraqucha, khipu, tampu, kuntur, the, different, orthographies, are, still, highly, controversial, in, peru, advocates, of, the, traditional, system, believe, that, the, new, orthographies, look, too, foreign, and, believe, that, it, makes, quechua, harder, to, learn, for, people, who, have, first, been, exposed, to, written, spanish, those, who, prefer, the, new, system, maintain, that, it, better, matches, the, phonology, of, quechua, and, they, point, to, studies, showing, that, teaching, the, five, vowel, system, to, children, later, causes, reading, difficulties, in, spanish, for, more, on, this, see, quechuan, and, aymaran, spelling, shift, writers, differ, in, the, treatment, of, spanish, loanwords, these, are, sometimes, adapted, to, modern, orthography, and, sometimes, left, as, in, spanish, for, instance, i, am, roberto, could, be, written, robertom, kani, or, ruwirtum, kani, the, m, is, not, part, of, the, name, it, is, an, evidential, suffix, showing, how, the, information, is, known, firsthand, in, this, case, the, peruvian, linguist, rodolfo, cerr, n, palomino, has, proposed, an, orthographic, norm, for, all, of, southern, quechua, this, standard, quechua, el, quechua, est, ndar, or, hanan, runasimi, conservatively, integrates, features, of, the, two, widespread, dialects, ayacucho, quechua, and, cusco, quechua, for, instance, the, spanish, based, orthography, is, now, in, conflict, with, peruvian, law, according, to, article, 20, of, the, decree, decreto, supremo, no, 004, 2016, mc, which, approves, regulations, relative, to, law, 29735, published, in, the, official, newspaper, el, peruano, on, july, 22, 2016, adequate, spellings, of, the, toponyms, in, the, normalized, alphabets, of, the, indigenous, languages, must, progressively, be, proposed, with, the, aim, of, standardizing, the, spellings, used, by, the, national,

and, their, subtle, shades, of, meaning, all, varieties, of, quechua, are, very, regular, agglutinative, languages, as, opposed, to, isolating, or, fusional, ones, their, normal, sentence, order, is, sov, subject, object, verb, notable, grammatical, features, include, bipersonal, conjugation, verbs, agree, with, both, subject, and, object, evidentiality, indication, of, the, source, and, veracity, of, knowledge, a, set, of, topic, particles, and, suffixes, indicating, who, benefits, from, an, action, and, the, speaker, s, attitude, toward, it, but, some, varieties, may, lack, some, of, the, characteristics, uqayku, exclusive, in, quechua, there, are, seven, pronouns, first, person, plural, pronouns, equivalent, to, we, may, be, inclusive, or, exclusive, which, mean, respectively, that, the, addressee, you, is, or, is, not, part, of, the, we, quechua, also, adds, the, suffix, kuna, to, the, second, and, third, person, singular, pronouns, qam, and, pay, to, create, the, plural, forms, qam, kuna, and, pay, kuna, in, quechua, iib, or, kichwa, the, exclusive, first, person, plural, pronoun, uqayku, is, generally, obsolete, adjectives, in, quechua, are, always, placed, before, nouns,

by, adding, ta, or, in, some, cases, lla, to, an, adjective, allin, allinta, good, well, utqay, utqaylla, quick, quickly, they, are, also, formed, by, adding, suffixes, to, demonstratives, chay, that, chaypi, there, kay, this, kayman, hither, there, are, several, original, adverbs, for, europeans, it, is, striking, that, the, adverb, qhipa, means, both, behind, and, future, and, awpa, means, ahead, in, front, and, past, local, and, temporal, concepts, of, adverbs, in, quechua, as, well, as, in, aymara, are, associated, to, each, other, reversely, compared, to, european, languages, for, the,
