indispensable, to, balance, humors, in, food, on, a, daily, basis, for, good, health, at, a, time, of, recurrent, pandemics, in, addition, to, being, desired, by, those, using, medieval, medicine, the, european, elite, also, craved, spices, in, the, middle, ages, believing, spices, to, be, from, and, a, connection, to, paradise, an, example, of, the, european, aristocracy, s, demand, for, spice, comes, from, the, king, of, aragon, who, invested, substantial, resources, into, importing, spices, to, spain, in, the, 12th, century, he, was, specifically, looking, for, spices, to, put, in, wine, and, was, not, alone, among, european, monarchs, at, the, time, to, have, such, a, desire, for, spice, spices, were, all, imported, from, plantations, in, asia, and, africa, which, made, them, expensive, from, the, 8th, until, the, 15th, century, the, republic, of, venice, held, a, monopoly, on, spice, trade, with, the, middle, east, using, this, position, to, dominate, the, neighboring, italian, maritime, republics, and, city, states, the, trade, made, the, region, rich, it, has, been, estimated, that, around, 1, 000, tons, of, pepper, and, 1, 000, tons, of, other, common, spices, were, imported, into, western, europe, each, year, during, the, late, middle, ages, the, value, of, these, goods, was, the, equivalent, of, a, yearly, supply, of, grain, for, 1, 5, million, people, the, most, exclusive, was, saffron, used, as, much, for, its, vivid, yellow, red, color, as, for, its, flavor, spices, that, have, now, fallen, into, obscurity, in, european, cuisine, include, grains, of, paradise, a, relative, of, cardamom, which, mostly, replaced, pepper, in, late, medieval, north, french, cooking, long, pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal, and, cubeb, voyagers, from, spain, and, portugal, were, interested, in, seeking, new, routes, to, trade, in, spices, and, other, valuable, products, from, asia, the, control, of, trade, routes, and, the, spice, producing, regions, were, the, main, reasons, that, portuguese, navigator, vasco, da, gama, sailed, to, india, in, 1499, when, da, gama, discovered, the, pepper, market, in, india, he, was, able, to, secure, peppers, for, a, much, cheaper, price, than, the, ones, demanded, by, venice, at, around, the, same, time, christopher, columbus, returned, from, the, new, world, he, described, to, investors, the, new, spices, available, there, another, source, of, competition, in, the, spice, trade, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, was, the, ragusans, from, the, maritime, republic, of, dubrovnik, in, southern, croatia, the, military, prowess, of, afonso, de, albuquerque, 1453, 1515, allowed, the, portuguese, to, take, control, of, the, sea, routes, to, india, in, 1506, he, took, the, island, of, socotra, in, the, mouth, of, the, red, sea, and, in, 1507, ormuz, in, the, persian, gulf, since, becoming, the, viceroy, of, the, indies, he, took, goa, in, india, in, 1510, and, malacca, on, the, malay, peninsula, in, 1511, the, portuguese, could, now, trade, directly, with, siam, china, and, the, maluku, islands, with, the, discovery, of, the, new, world, came, new, spices, including, allspice, chili, peppers, vanilla, and, chocolate, this, development, kept, the, spice, trade, with, america, as, a, latecomer, with, its, new, seasonings, profitable, well, into, the, 19th, century, spices, are, primarily, used, as, food, flavoring, or, to, create, variety, they, are, also, used, to, perfume, cosmetics, and, incense, at, various, periods, many, spices, were, used, in, herbal, medicine, finally, since, they, can, be, expensive, rare, and, exotic, commodities, their, conspicuous, consumption, has, often, been, a, symbol, of, wealth, and, social, class, the, most, popular, explanation, for, the, love, of, spices, in, the, middle, ages, is, that, they, were, used, to, preserve, meat, from, spoiling, or, to, cover, up, the, taste, of, meat, that, had, already, gone, off, this, compelling, but, false, idea, constitutes, something, of, an, urban, legend, a, story, so, instinctively, attractive, that, mere, fact, seems, unable, to, wipe, it, out, anyone, who, could, afford, spices, could, easily, find, meat, fresher, than, what, city, dwellers, today, buy, in, their, local, supermarket, it, is, often, claimed, that, spices, were, used, either, as, food, preservatives, or, to, mask, the, taste, of, spoiled, meat, especially, in, the, european, middle, ages, this, is, false, in, fact, spices, are, rather, ineffective, as, preservatives, as, compared, to, salting, smoking, pickling, or, drying, and, are, ineffective, in, covering, the, taste, of, spoiled, meat, moreover, spices, have, always, been, comparatively, expensive, in, 15th, century, oxford, a, whole, pig, cost, about, the, same, as, a, pound, of, the, cheapest, spice, pepper, there, is, also, no, evidence, of, such, use, from, contemporary, cookbooks, old, cookbooks, make, it, clear, that, spices, weren, t, used, as, a, preservative, they, typically, suggest, adding, spices, toward, the, end, of, the, cooking, process, where, they, could, have, no, preservative, effect, whatsoever, indeed, cristoforo, di, messisbugo, suggested, in, the, 16th, century, that, pepper, may, speed, up, spoilage, though, some, spices, have, antimicrobial, properties, in, vitro, pepper, by, far, the, most, common, spice, is, relatively, ineffective, and, in, any, case, salt, which, is, far, cheaper, is, also, far, more, effective, a, mortar, and, pestle, is, the, classic, set, of, tools, for, grinding, a, whole, spice, less, labor, intensive, tools, are, more, common, now, a, microplane, or, fine, grater, can, be, used, to, grind, small, amounts, a, coffee, grinder, is, useful, for, larger, amounts, a, frequently, used, spice, such, as, black, pepper, may, merit, storage, in, its, own, hand, grinder, or, mill, the, flavor, of, a, spice, is, derived, in, part, from, compounds, volatile, oils, that, oxidize, or, evaporate, when, exposed, to, air, grinding, a, spice, greatly, increases, its, surface, area, and, so, increases, the, rates, of, oxidation, and, evaporation, thus, the, flavor, is, maximized, by, storing, a, spice, whole, and, grinding, when, needed, the, shelf, life, of, a, whole, dry, spice, is, roughly, two, years, of, a, ground, spice, roughly, six, months, the, flavor, life, of, a, ground, spice, can, be, much, shorter, ground, spices, are, better, stored, away, from, light, some, flavor, elements, in, spices, are, soluble, in, water, many, are, soluble, in, oil, or, fat, as, a, general, rule, the, flavors, from, a, spice, take, time, to, infuse, into, the, food, so, spices, are, added, early, in, preparation, this, contrasts, to, herbs, which, are, usually, added, late, in, preparation, a, study, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, of, shipments, of, spices, to, the, united, states, during, fiscal, years, 2007, 2009, showed, about, 7, of, the, shipments, were, contaminated, by, salmonella, bacteria, some, of, it, antibiotic, resistant, as, most, spices, are, cooked, before, being, served, salmonella, contamination, often, has, no, effect, but, some, spices, particularly, pepper, are, often, eaten, raw, and, are, present, at, the, table, for, convenient, use, shipments, from, mexico, and, india, a, major, producer, were, the, most, frequently, contaminated, food, irradiation, is, said, to, minimize, this, risk, the, international, organization, for, standardization, addresses, spices, and, condiments, along, with, related, food, additives, as, part, of, the, international, classification, for, standards, 67, 220, series
