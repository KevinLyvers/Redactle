cross, country, skiing, is, a, form, of, skiing, whereby, skiers, traverse, snow, covered, terrain, without, use, of, ski, lifts, or, other, assistance, cross, country, skiing, is, widely, practiced, as, a, sport, and, recreational, activity, however, some, still, use, it, as, a, means, of, travel, variants, of, cross, country, skiing, are, adapted, to, a, range, of, terrain, which, spans, unimproved, sometimes, mountainous, terrain, to, groomed, courses, that, are, specifically, designed, for, the, sport, modern, cross, country, skiing, is, similar, to, the, original, form, of, skiing, from, which, all, skiing, disciplines, evolved, including, alpine, skiing, ski, jumping, and, telemark, skiing, skiers, propel, themselves, either, by, striding, forward, classic, style, or, side, to, side, in, a, skating, motion, skate, skiing, aided, by, arms, pushing, on, ski, poles, against, the, snow, it, is, practised, in, regions, with, snow, covered, landscapes, including, europe, canada, russia, the, united, states, australia, and, new, zealand, competitive, cross, country, skiing, is, one, of, the, nordic, skiing, sports, cross, country, skiing, and, rifle, marksmanship, are, the, two, components, of, biathlon, ski, orienteering, is, a, form, of, cross, country, skiing, which, includes, map, navigation, along, snow, trails, and, tracks, the, word, ski, comes, from, the, old, norse, word, sk, which, means, stick, of, wood, skiing, started, as, a, technique, for, traveling, cross, country, over, snow, on, skis, starting, almost, five, millennia, ago, with, beginnings, in, scandinavia, it, may, have, been, practised, as, early, as, 600, bce, in, daxing, anling, in, what, is, now, china, early, historical, evidence, includes, procopius, s, around, ce, 550, description, of, sami, people, as, skrithiphinoi, translated, as, ski, running, samis, birkely, argues, that, the, sami, people, have, practiced, skiing, for, more, than, 6000, years, evidenced, by, the, very, old, sami, word, uoigat, for, skiing, egil, skallagrimsson, s, 950, ce, saga, describes, king, haakon, the, good, s, practice, of, sending, his, tax, collectors, out, on, skis, the, gulating, law, 1274, stated, that, no, moose, shall, be, disturbed, by, skiers, on, private, land, cross, country, skiing, evolved, from, a, utilitarian, means, of, transportation, to, being, a, worldwide, recreational, activity, and, sport, which, branched, out, into, other, forms, of, skiing, starting, in, the, mid, 1800s, early, skiers, used, one, long, pole, or, spear, in, addition, to, the, skis, the, first, depiction, of, a, skier, with, two, ski, poles, dates, to, 1741, traditional, skis, used, for, snow, travel, in, norway, and, elsewhere, into, the, 1800s, often, comprised, one, short, ski, with, a, natural, fur, traction, surface, the, andor, and, one, long, for, gliding, the, langski, one, being, up, to, 100, cm, 39, in, longer, than, the, other, allowing, skiers, to, propel, themselves, with, a, scooter, motion, this, combination, has, a, long, history, among, the, sami, people, skis, up, to, 280, cm, have, been, produced, in, finland, and, the, longest, recorded, ski, in, norway, is, 373, cm, ski, warfare, the, use, of, ski, equipped, troops, in, war, is, first, recorded, by, the, danish, historian, saxo, grammaticus, in, the, 13th, century, these, troops, were, reportedly, able, to, cover, distances, comparable, to, that, of, light, cavalry, the, garrison, in, trondheim, used, skis, at, least, from, 1675, and, the, danish, norwegian, army, included, specialized, skiing, battalions, from, 1747, details, of, military, ski, exercises, from, 1767, are, on, record, skis, were, used, in, military, exercises, in, 1747, in, 1799, french, traveller, jacques, de, la, tocnaye, recorded, his, visit, to, norway, in, his, travel, diary, norwegian, immigrants, used, skis, norwegian, snowshoes, in, the, us, midwest, from, around, 1836, norwegian,

long, racing, on, flat, ground, an, early, record, of, a, public, ski, competition, occurred, in, troms, 1843, in, norwegian, langrenn, refers, to, competitive, skiing, where, the, goal, is, to, complete, a, specific, distance, in, groomed, tracks, in, the, shortest, possible, time, in, norway, ski, touring, competitions, norwegian, turrenn, are, long, distance, cross, country, competitions, open, to, the, public, competition, is, usually, within, age, intervals, a, new, technique, skate, skiing, was, experimented, with, early, in, the, 20th, century, but, was, not, widely, adopted, until, the, 1980s, johan, gr, ttumsbr, ten, used, the, skating, technique, at, the, 1931, world, championship, in, oberhof, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, skating, in, competitive, cross, country, skiing, this, technique, was, later, used, in, ski, orienteering, in, the, 1960s, on, roads, and, other, firm, surfaces, it, became, widespread, during, the, 1980s, after, the, success, of, bill, koch, united, states, in, 1982, cross, country, skiing, championships, drew, more, attention, to, the, skating, style, norwegian, skier, ove, aunli, started, using, the, technique, in, 1984, when, he, found, it, to, be, much, faster, than, classic, style, finnish, skier, pauli, siitonen, developed, a, one, sided, variant, of, the, style, in, the, 1970s, leaving, one, ski, in, the, track, while, skating, to, the, side, with, the, other, one, during, endurance, events, this, became, known, as, the, marathon, skate, the, word, ski, comes, from, the, old, norse, word, sk, which, means, cleft, wood, stick, of, wood, or, ski, norwegian, language, does, not, use, a, verb, form, equivalent, in, idiomatic, speech, unlike, english, to, ski, in, modern, norwegian, a, variety, of, terms, refer, to, cross, country, skiing, including, in, contrast, alpine, skiing, is, referred, to, as, st, p, ski, literally, stand, on, skis, fridtjof, nansen, describes, the, crossing, of, greenland, as, p, ski, over, gr, nland, literally, on, skis, across, greenland, while, the, english, edition, of, the, report, was, titled, the, first, crossing, of, greenland, nansen, referred, to, the, activity, of, traversing, snow, on, skis, as, norwegian, skil, bning, he, used, the, term, also, in, the, english, translation, which, may, be, translated, as, ski, running, nansen, used, skil, bning, regarding, all, forms, of, skiing, but, noted, that, ski, jumping, is, purely, a, competitive, sport, and, not, for, amateurs, he, further, noted, that, in, some, competitions, the, skier, is, also, required, to, show, his, skill, in, turning, his, ski, to, one, side, or, the, other, within, given, marks, at, full, speed, on, a, steep, hill, nansen, regarded, these, forms, i, e, jumping, and, slalom, as, special, arts, and, believed, that, the, most, important, branch, of, skiing, was, travel, in, an, ordinary, way, across, the, country, in, germany, nansen, s, greenland, report, was, published, as, auf, schneeschuhen, durch, gr, nland, literally, on, snowshoes, through, greenland, the, german, term, schneeschuh, was, supplanted, by, the, borrowed, norwegian, word, ski, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, norwegian, encyclopedia, of, sports, also, uses, the, term, skil, ping, literally, ski, running, for, all, forms, of, skiing, around, 1900, the, word, skilaufen, was, used, in, german, in, the, same, sense, as, norwegian, skil, ping, recreational, cross, country, skiing, includes, ski, touring, and, groomed, trail, skiing, typically, at, resorts, or, in, parklands, it, is, an, accessible, form, of, recreation, for, persons, with, vision, and, mobility, impairments, a, related, form, of, recreation, is, dog, skijoring, a, winter, sport, where, a, cross, country, skier, is, assisted, by, one, or, more, dogs, ski, touring, takes, place, off, piste, and, outside, of, ski, resorts, tours, may, extend, over, multiple, days, typically, skis, bindings, and, boots, allow, for, free, movement, of, the, heel, to, enable, a, walking, pace, as, with, nordic, disciplines, and, unlike, alpine, skiing, ski, touring, s, subgenre, ski, mountaineering, involves, independently, navigating, and, route, finding, through, potential, avalanche, terrain, and, often, requires, familiarity, with, meteorology, along, with, skiing, skills, ski, touring, can, be, faster, and, easier, than, summer, hiking, in, some, terrain, allowing, for, traverses, and, ascents, that, would, be, harder, in, the, summer, skis, can, also, be, used, to, access, backcountry, alpine, climbing, routes, when, snow, is, off, the, technical, route, but, still, covers, the, hiking, trail, in, some, countries, organizations, maintain, a, network, of, huts, for, use, by, cross, country, skiers, in, wintertime, for, example, the, norwegian, trekking, association, maintains, over, 400, huts, stretching, across, thousands, of, kilometres, of, trails, which, hikers, can, use, in, the, summer, and, skiers, in, the, winter, groomed, trail, skiing, occurs, at, facilities, such, as, nordmarka, oslo, royal, gorge, cross, country, ski, resort, and, gatineau, park, in, quebec, where, trails, are, laid, out, and, groomed, for, both, classic, and, skate, skiing, such, grooming, and, track, setting, for, classic, technique, requires, specialized, equipment, and, techniques, that, adapt, to, the, condition, of, the, snow, trail, preparation, employs, snow, machines, which, tow, snow, compaction, texturing, and, track, setting, devices, groomers, must, adapt, such, equipment, to, the, condition, of, the, snow, crystal, structure, temperature, degree, of, compaction, moisture, content, etc, depending, on, the, initial, condition, of, the, snow, grooming, may, achieve, an, increase, in, density, for, new, fallen, snow, or, a, decrease, in, density, for, icy, or, compacted, snow, cross, country, ski, facilities, may, incorporate, a, course, design, that, meets, homologation, standards, for, such, organizations, as, the, international, olympic, committee, the, international, ski, federation, or, national, standards, standards, address, course, distances, degree, of, difficulty, with, maximums, in, elevation, difference, and, steepness, both, up, and, downhill, plus, other, factors, some, facilities, have, night, time, lighting, on, select, trails, called, lysl, ype, light, trails, in, norwegian, and, elljussp, r, electric, light, trails, in, swedish, the, first, lysl, ype, opened, in, 1946, in, nordmarka, and, at, by, sen, trondheim,

navigability, in, snow, other, symbols, indicate, whether, any, roads, are, snow, covered, or, clear, standard, skate, skiing, equipment, is, used, along, with, a, map, holder, attached, to, the, chest, it, is, one, of, the, four, orienteering, disciplines, recognized, by, the, international, orienteering, federation, upper, body, strength, is, especially, important, because, of, frequent, double, poling, along, narrow, snow, trails, paralympic, cross, country, ski, competition, is, an, adaptation, of, cross, country, skiing, for, athletes, with, disabilities, paralympic, cross, country, skiing, includes, standing, events, sitting, events, for, wheelchair, users, and, events, for, visually, impaired, athletes, under, the, rules, of, the, international, paralympic, committee, these, are, divided, into, several, categories, for, people, who, are, missing, limbs, have, amputations, are, blind, or, have, any, other, physical, disability, to, continue, their, sport, cross, country, skiing, has, two, basic, propulsion, techniques, which, apply, to, different, surfaces, classic, undisturbed, snow, and, tracked, snow, and, skate, skiing, firm, smooth, snow, surfaces, the, classic, technique, relies, on, a, wax, or, texture, on, the, ski, bottom, under, the, foot, for, traction, on, the, snow, to, allow, the, skier, to, slide, the, other, ski, forward, in, virgin, or, tracked, snow, with, the, skate, skiing, technique, a, skier, slides, on, alternating, skis, on, a, firm, snow, surface, at, an, angle, from, each, other, in, a, manner, similar, to, ice, skating, both, techniques, employ, poles, with, baskets, that, allow, the, arms, to, participate, in, the, propulsion, specialized, equipment, is, adapted, to, each, technique, and, each, type, of, terrain, a, variety, of, turns, are, used, when, descending, poles, contribute, to, forward, propulsion, either, simultaneously, usual, for, the, skate, technique, or, in, alternating, sequence, common, for, the, classical, technique, as, the, diagonal, stride, double, poling, is, also, used, with, the, classical, technique, when, higher, speed, can, be, achieved, on, flats, and, slight, downhills, than, is, available, in, the, diagonal, stride, which, is, favored, to, achieve, higher, power, going, uphill, the, classic, style, is, often, used, on, prepared, trails, pistes, that, have, pairs, of, parallel, grooves, tracks, cut, into, the, snow, it, is, also, the, most, usual, technique, where, no, tracks, have, been, prepared, with, this, technique, each, ski, is, pushed, forward, from, the, other, stationary, ski, in, a, striding, and, gliding, motion, alternating, foot, to, foot, with, the, diagonal, stride, variant, the, poles, are, planted, alternately, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, forward, striding, foot, with, the, kick, double, pole, variant, the, poles, are, planted, simultaneously, with, every, other, stride, at, times, especially, with, gentle, descents, double, poling, is, the, sole, means, of, propulsion, on, uphill, terrain, techniques, include, the, side, step, for, steep, slopes, moving, the, skis, perpendicular, to, the, fall, line, the, herringbone, for, moderate, slopes, where, the, skier, takes, alternating, steps, with, the, skis, splayed, outwards, and, for, gentle, slopes, the, skier, uses, the, diagonal, technique, with, shorter, strides, and, greater, arm, force, on, the, poles, with, skate, skiing, the, skier, provides, propulsion, on, a, smooth, firm, snow, surface, by, pushing, alternating, skis, away, from, one, another, at, an, angle, in, a, manner, similar, to, ice, skating, skate, skiing, usually, involves, a, coordinated, use, of, poles, and, the, upper, body, to, add, impetus, three, common, techniques, are, v1, v2, and, v2, alternate, in, v1, the, skier, pushes, with, a, double, pole, plant, each, time, the, ski, is, extended, on, a, temporarily, dominant, side, this, technique, is, optimal, for, climbing, in, v2, alternate, the, skier, performs, the, double, pole, plant, before, the, dominant, ski, is, extended, this, technique, allows, for, maintaining, a, higher, speed, and, is, often, used, on, slightly, downhill, terrsin, in, v2, the, skier, performs, the, double, pole, plant, each, time, the, ski, is, extended, on, either, side, on, flat, ground, and, in, slight, inclines, this, technique, is, often, the, fastest, and, most, efficient, of, the, 3, skiers, climb, hills, with, these, techniques, by, widening, the, angle, of, the, v, and, by, making, more, frequent, shorter, strides, and, more, forceful, use, of, poles, a, variant, of, the, technique, is, the, marathon, skate, or, siitonen, step, where, the, skier, leaves, one, ski, in, the, track, while, skating, outwards, to, the, side, with, the, other, ski, turns, used, while, descending, or, for, braking, include, the, snowplough, or, wedge, turn, the, stem, christie, or, wedge, christie, parallel, turn, and, the, telemark, turn, the, step, turn, is, used, for, maintaining, speed, during, descents, or, out, of, track, on, flats, equipment, comprises, skis, poles, boots, and, bindings, these, vary, according, to, skis, used, in, cross, country, are, lighter, and, narrower, than, those, used, in, alpine, skiing, ski, bottoms, are, designed, to, provide, a, gliding, surface, and, for, classic, skis, a, traction, zone, under, foot, the, base, of, the, gliding, surface, is, a, plastic, material, that, is, designed, both, to, minimize, friction, and, in, many, cases, to, accept, waxes, glide, wax, may, be, used, on, the, tails, and, tips, of, classic, skis, and, across, the, length, of, skate, skis, each, type, of, ski, is, sized, and, designed, differently, length, affects, maneuverability, camber, affects, pressure, on, the, snow, beneath, the, feet, of, the, skier, side, cut, affects, the, ease, of, turning, width, affects, forward, friction, overall, area, on, the, snow, affects, bearing, capacity, and, tip, geometry, affects, the, ability, to, penetrate, new, snow, or, to, stay, in, a, track, each, of, the, following, ski, types, has, a, different, combination, of, these, attributes, glide, waxes, enhance, the, speed, of, the, gliding, surface, the, wax, is, either, melted, on, the, base, using, an, iron, or, applied, in, a, liquid, form, the, excess, wax, is, first, scraped, off, and, then, finished, by, brushing, most, glide, waxes, are, based, on, paraffin, that, is, combined, with, additive, materials, the, paraffin, hardness, and, additives, are, varied, based, on, snow, type, humidity, and, temperature, since, the, 2021, 2022, race, season, fluorinated, products, are, banned, in, fis, sanctioned, competitions, before, the, ban, most, race, waxes, combined, fluorinated, hydrocarbon, waxes, with, fluorocarbon, overlays, fluorocarbons, decrease, surface, tension, and, surface, area, of, the, water, between, the, ski, and, the, snow, increasing, speed, and, glide, of, the, ski, under, specific, conditions, either, combined, with, the, wax, or, applied, after, in, a, spray, powder, or, block, form, fluorocarbons, significantly, improve, the, glide, of, the, ski, skis, designed, for, classic, technique, both, in, track, and, in, virgin, snow, rely, on, a, traction, zone, called, the, grip, zone, or, kick, zone, underfoot, this, comes, either, from, a, texture, such, as, fish, scales, or, mohair, skins, designed, to, slide, forward, but, not, backwards, that, is, built, into, the, grip, zone, of, waxless, skis, or, from, applied, devices, e, g, climbing, skins, or, b, from, grip, waxes, grip, waxes, are, classified, according, to, their, hardness, harder, waxes, are, for, colder, and, newer, snow, an, incorrect, choice, of, grip, wax, for, the, snow, conditions, encountered, may, cause, ski, slippage, wax, too, hard, for, the, conditions, or, snow, sticking, to, the, grip, zone, wax, too, soft, for, the, conditions, grip, waxes, generate, grip, by, interacting, with, snow, crystals, which, vary, with, temperature, age, and, compaction, hard, grip, waxes, do, not, work, well, for, snow, which, has, metamorphosed, to, having, coarse, grains, whether, icy, or, wet, in, these, conditions, skiers, opt, for, a, stickier, substance, called, klister, ski, boots, are, attached, to, the, ski, only, at, the, toe, leaving, the, heel, free, depending, on, application, boots, may, be, lightweight, performance, skiing, or, heavier, and, more, supportive, back, country, skiing, bindings, connect, the, boot, to, the, ski, there, are, three, primary, groups, of, binding, systems, used, in, cross, country, skiing, in, descending, order, of, importance, ski, poles, are, used, for, balance, and, propulsion, modern, cross, country, ski, poles, are, made, from, aluminium, fibreglass, reinforced, plastic, or, carbon, fibre, depending, on, weight, cost, and, performance, parameters, formerly, they, were, made, of, wood, or, bamboo, they, feature, a, foot, called, a, basket, near, the, end, of, the, shaft, that, provides, a, pushing, platform, as, it, makes, contact, with, the, snow, baskets, vary, in, size, according, to, the, expected, softness, firmness, of, the, snow, racing, poles, feature, smaller, lighter, baskets, than, recreational, poles, poles, designed, for, skating, are, longer, than, those, designed, for, classic, skiing, traditional, skiing, in, the, 1800s, used, a, single, pole, for, both, cross, country, and, downhill, the, single, pole, was, longer, and, stronger, than, the, poles, that, are, used, in, pairs, in, competitive, cross, country, poles, in, pairs, were, introduced, around, 1900
