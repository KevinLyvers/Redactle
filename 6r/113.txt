margarine, m, r, d, r, i, n, also, uk, m, r, m, r, r, i, n, m, r, d, us, m, r, d, r, n, is, a, spread, used, for, flavoring, baking, and, cooking, it, is, most, often, used, as, a, substitute, for, butter, although, originally, made, from, animal, fats, most, margarine, consumed, today, is, made, from, vegetable, oil, the, spread, was, originally, named, oleomargarine, from, latin, for, oleum, olive, oil, and, greek, margarite, pearl, indicating, luster, the, name, was, later, shortened, to, margarine, margarine, consists, of, a, water, in, fat, emulsion, with, tiny, droplets, of, water, dispersed, uniformly, throughout, a, fat, phase, in, a, stable, solid, form, while, butter, is, made, by, concentrating, the, butterfat, of, milk, through, agitation, modern, margarine, is, made, through, a, more, intensive, processing, of, refined, vegetable, oil, and, water, per, federal, regulation, margarine, must, have, a, minimum, fat, content, of, 80, percent, with, a, maximum, of, 16, water, to, be, labeled, as, such, in, the, united, states, although, the, term, is, used, informally, to, describe, vegetable, oil, based, spreads, with, lower, fat, content, in, britain, it, can, be, referred, to, colloquially, as, marge, margarine, can, be, used, as, an, ingredient, in, other, food, products, such, as, pastries, doughnuts, cakes, and, cookies, margarine, has, its, roots, in, the, discovery, by, french, chemist, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, in, 1813, of, margaric, acid, scientists, at, the, time, regarded, margaric, acid, like, oleic, acid, and, stearic, acid, as, one, of, the, three, fatty, acids, that, in, combination, form, most, animal, fats, in, 1853, the, german, structural, chemist, wilhelm, heinrich, heintz, analyzed, margaric, acid, as, simply, a, combination, of, stearic, acid, and, the, previously, unknown, palmitic, acid, after, the, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, issued, a, challenge, to, create, a, butter, substitute, from, beef, tallow, for, the, armed, forces, and, lower, classes, hippolyte, m, ge, mouri, s, invented, margarine, in, 1869, m, ge, mouri, s, patented, the, product, which, he, named, oleomargarine, and, expanded, his, initial, manufacturing, operation, from, france, but, had, little, commercial, success, in, 1871, he, sold, the, patent, to, the, dutch, company, jurgens, which, subsequently, became, part, of, unilever, in, the, same, year, a, german, pharmacist, benedict, klein, from, cologne, founded, the, first, margarine, factory, in, germany, producing, the, brands, overstolz, and, botteram, the, principal, raw, material, in, the, original, formulation, of, margarine, was, beef, fat, in, 1871, henry, w, bradley, of, binghamton, new, york, received, u, s, patent, 110, 626, for, a, process, of, creating, margarine, that, combined, vegetable, oils, primarily, cottonseed, oil, with, animal, fats, in, 1874, the, first, commercial, cargo, arrived, in, the, uk, by, the, late, 19th, century, some, 37, companies, were, manufacturing, margarine, in, the, us, in, opposition, to, the, butter, industry, which, protested, and, lobbied, for, government, intervention, eventually, leading, to, the, 1886, margarine, act, imposing, punitive, fees, against, margarine, manufacturers, shortages, in, beef, fat, supply, combined, with, advances, by, james, f, boyce, and, paul, sabatier, in, the, hydrogenation, of, plant, materials, soon, accelerated, the, use, of, bradley, s, method, and, between, 1900, and, 1920, commercial, oleomargarine, was, produced, from, a, combination, of, animal, fats, and, hardened, and, unhardened, vegetable, oils, the, great, depression, followed, by, rationing, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, united, kingdom, among, other, countries, during, world, war, ii, led, to, a, reduction, in, supply, of, animal, fat, and, butter, and, by, 1945, original, margarine, had, almost, completely, disappeared, from, the, market, in, the, united, states, problems, with, supply, coupled, with, changes, in, legislation, caused, margarine, manufacturers, to, switch, almost, completely, to, vegetable, oils, and, fats, by, 1950, and, the, margarine, industry, was, ready, for, an, era, of, product, development, carotene, in, the, milk, of, grass, fed, cows, gives, butter, produced, from, such, milk, a, slightly, yellow, color, however, being, a, synthetic, product, margarine, has, a, white, color, resembling, lard, which, many, people, found, unappetizing, around, the, late, 1880s, manufacturers, began, coloring, margarine, yellow, to, improve, sales, dairy, firms, especially, in, wisconsin, became, alarmed, at, the, potential, threat, to, their, business, and, succeeded, in, getting, legislation, passed, to, prohibit, the, coloring, of, the, stark, white, margarine, by, 1902, in, response, margarine, companies, distributed, margarine, together, with, a, packet, of, yellow, food, coloring, the, product, was, placed, in, a, bowl, and, the, coloring, mixed, in, manually, taking, some, time, and, effort, especially, if, the, mixing, needed, to, be, done, by, hand, typically, the, case, at, the, time, since, domestic, electric, mixers, were, rarely, used, before, the, 1920s, it, was, therefore, not, unusual, for, the, final, product, to, be, served, as, a, light, and, dark, yellow, or, even, white, striped, product, during, world, war, ii, there, was, a, shortage, of, butter, in, the, united, states, causing, margarine, to, became, popular, in, 1951, the, w, e, dennison, company, received, u, s, patent, 2, 553, 513, for, a, method, to, place, a, capsule, of, yellow, dye, inside, a, plastic, package, of, margarine, after, purchase, the, capsule, was, broken, by, pressing, on, the, outside, of, the, package, and, the, package, was, kneaded, to, distribute, the, dye, the, artificial, coloring, laws, began, being, repealed, around, 1955, and, margarine, could, once, again, be, sold, colored, like, butter, in, most, states, the, final, hold, out, was, wisconsin, which, finally, repealed, its, restrictions, in, 1967, around, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, arthur, imhausen, developed, and, implemented, an, industrial, process, in, germany, for, producing, edible, fats, by, oxidizing, synthetic, paraffin, wax, made, from, coal, the, products, were, fractionally, distilled, and, the, edible, fats, were, obtained, from, the, c, 9, c, 16, fraction, which, were, reacted, with, glycerol, such, as, that, synthesized, from, propylene, margarine, made, from, them, was, found, to, be, nutritious, and, of, agreeable, taste, and, it, was, incorporated, into, diets, contributing, as, much, as, 700, calories, per, day, the, process, required, at, least, 60, kilograms, of, coal, per, kilogram, of, synthetic, butter, that, industrial, process, was, discontinued, after, wwii, due, to, its, inefficiency, during, the, second, world, war, and, immediate, post, war, years, amid, rationing, in, the, united, kingdom, only, two, types, of, margarine, were, available, a, premium, brand, and, a, budget, brand, with, whale, oil, being, used, in, its, manufacture, with, the, end, of, rationing, in, 1955, the, market, was, opened, to, the, forces, of, supply, and, demand, and, brand, marketing, became, prevalent, the, competition, among, the, major, producers, was, given, further, impetus, with, the, beginning, of, commercial, television, advertising, in, 1955, and, throughout, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, competing, companies, vied, with, each, other, to, produce, the, margarine, that, tasted, most, like, butter, in, the, mid, 1960s, the, introduction, of, two, lower, fat, blends, of, butter, oil, and, vegetable, oils, in, scandinavia, called, l, tt, lagom, and, bregott, clouded, the, issue, of, what, should, be, called, margarine, and, began, the, debate, that, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, term, spread, in, 1978, an, 80, fat, product, called, krona, made, by, churning, a, blend, of, dairy, cream, and, vegetable, oils, was, introduced, in, europe, and, in, 1982, a, blend, of, cream, and, vegetable, oils, called, clover, was, introduced, in, the, uk, by, the, milk, marketing, board, the, vegetable, oil, and, cream, spread, i, can, t, believe, it, s, not, butter, was, introduced, into, the, united, states, in, 1981, and, in, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, in, 1991, in, the, 21st, century, margarine, spreads, had, many, developments, to, improve, their, consumer, appeal, most, brands, phased, out, the, use, of, hydrogenated, oils, and, became, trans, fat, free, many, brands, launched, refrigerator, stable, margarine, spreads, that, contain, only, one, third, of, the, fat, and, calorie, content, of, traditional, spreads, other, varieties, of, spreads, include, those, with, added, omega, 3, fatty, acids, low, or, no, salt, added, plant, sterols, claimed, to, reduce, blood, cholesterol, olive, oil, or, certified, vegan, oils, in, the, early, 21st, century, manufacturers, provided, margarines, in, plastic, squeeze, bottles, to, ease, dispensing, and, offered, pink, margarine, as, a, novelty, the, basic, method, of, making, margarine, today, consists, of, emulsifying, a, blend, of, oils, and, fats, from, vegetable, and, animal, sources, which, can, be, modified, using, fractionation, interesterification, or, hydrogenation, with, skimmed, milk, which, may, be, fermented, or, soured, salt, citric, or, lactic, acid, chilling, the, mixture, to, solidify, it, and, working, it, to, improve, the, texture, margarines, and, vegetable, fat, spreads, found, in, the, market, can, range, from, 10, to, 90, fat, depending, on, dietary, marketing, and, purpose, spreading, cooking, or, baking, the, softer, tub, margarines, are, made, with, less, hydrogenated, and, more, liquid, oils, than, block, margarines, three, types, of, margarine, are, common, to, produce, margarine, first, oils, and, fats, are, extracted, e, g, by, pressing, from, seeds, and, then, refined, oils, may, undergo, a, full, or, partial, hydrogenation, process, to, solidify, them, the, milk, water, mixture, is, kept, separate, from, the, oil, mixture, until, the, emulsion, step, the, fats, are, warmed, so, that, they, are, liquid, during, the, mixing, process, the, water, soluble, additives, are, added, to, the, water, or, milk, mixture, and, emulsifiers, such, as, lecithin, are, added, to, help, disperse, the, water, phase, evenly, throughout, the, oil, other, water, soluble, additives, include, powdered, skim, milk, salt, citric, acid, lactic, acid, and, preservatives, such, as, potassium, sorbate, the, fat, soluble, additives, are, mixed, into, the, oil, these, include, carotenoids, for, coloring, and, antioxidants, then, the, two, mixtures, are, emulsified, by, slowly, adding, the, oil, into, the, milk, water, mixture, with, constant, stirring, next, the, mixture, is, cooled, rapid, chilling, avoids, the, production, of, large, crystals, and, results, in, a, smooth, texture, the, product, is, then, rolled, or, kneaded, finally, the, product, may, be, aerated, with, nitrogen, to, facilitate, spreading, it, vegetable, and, animal, fats, are, similar, compounds, with, different, melting, points, fats, that, are, liquid, at, room, temperature, are, generally, known, as, oils, the, melting, points, are, related, to, the, presence, of, carbon, carbon, double, bonds, in, the, fatty, acids, components, a, higher, number, of, double, bonds, gives, a, lower, melting, point, oils, can, be, converted, into, solid, substances, at, room, temperature, through, hydrogenation, commonly, natural, oils, are, hydrogenated, by, passing, hydrogen, gas, through, the, oil, in, the, presence, of, a, nickel, catalyst, under, controlled, conditions, the, addition, of, hydrogen, to, the, unsaturated, bonds, alkenic, double, c, c, bonds, results, in, saturated, c, c, bonds, effectively, increasing, the, melting, point, of, the, oil, and, thus, hardening, it, this, is, due, to, the, increase, in, van, der, waals, forces, between, the, saturated, molecules, compared, with, the, unsaturated, molecules, however, as, there, are, possible, health, benefits, in, limiting, the, amount, of, saturated, fats, in, the, human, diet, the, process, is, controlled, so, that, only, enough, of, the, bonds, are, hydrogenated, to, give, the, required, texture, margarines, made, in, this, way, are, said, to, contain, hydrogenated, fat, this, method, is, used, today, for, some, margarines, although, the, process, has, been, developed, and, sometimes, other, metal, catalysts, are, used, such, as, palladium, if, hydrogenation, is, incomplete, partial, hardening, the, relatively, high, temperatures, used, in, the, hydrogenation, process, tend, to, flip, some, of, the, carbon, carbon, double, bonds, into, the, trans, form, if, these, particular, bonds, are, not, hydrogenated, during, the, process, they, remain, present, in, the, final, margarine, in, molecules, of, trans, fats, the, consumption, of, which, has, been, shown, to, be, a, risk, factor, for, cardiovascular, disease, for, this, reason, partially, hardened, fats, are, used, less, and, less, in, the, margarine, industry, some, tropical, oils, such, as, palm, oil, and, coconut, oil, are, naturally, semi, solid, and, do, not, require, hydrogenation, in, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, margarine, manufactured, from, soybean, oil, and, pasteurized, provides, 628, calories, and, is, composed, of, 70, fat, 2, carbohydrates, 26, water, and, negligible, protein, table, the, reference, margarine, was, rich, in, vitamin, e, 37, of, the, daily, value, dv, containing, 35, mg, gamma, tocopherol, and, sodium, 47, dv, added, as, salt, for, flavor, unless, fortified, with, micronutrients, during, manufacturing, there, are, no, other, nutrients, in, significant, content, vitamin, a, and, vitamin, d, may, be, added, for, fortification, margarine, contains, the, possible, carcionogens, and, toxins, 3, mcpd, 2, mcpd, and, glycidol, they, are, contaminants, that, are, created, during, the, oil, refining, process, especially, deodorization, the, roles, of, butter, and, traditional, margarine, 80, fat, are, similar, with, respect, to, their, energy, content, but, low, fat, margarines, and, spreads, are, also, widely, available, replacing, saturated, and, trans, unsaturated, fats, with, unhydrogenated, monounsaturated, or, polyunsaturated, fats, is, more, effective, in, preventing, coronary, heart, disease, than, reducing, overall, fat, intake, see, saturated, fat, and, cardiovascular, disease, vegetable, fats, can, contain, anything, from, 7, to, 86, saturated, fatty, acids, liquid, oils, canola, oil, sunflower, oil, tend, to, be, on, the, low, end, while, tropical, oils, coconut, oil, palm, kernel, oil, and, fully, hardened, hydrogenated, oils, are, at, the, high, end, of, the, scale, a, margarine, blend, is, a, mixture, of, both, types, of, components, generally, firmer, margarines, contain, more, saturated, fat, typical, soft, tub, margarine, contains, 10, to, 20, of, saturated, fat, regular, butterfat, contains, 52, to, 65, saturated, fats, the, american, institute, of, medicine, and, the, european, food, safety, authority, recommend, saturated, fat, intake, to, be, as, low, as, possible, consumption, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, has, been, found, to, decrease, ldl, cholesterol, levels, and, increase, hdl, cholesterol, levels, in, the, blood, thus, reducing, the, risk, of, developing, cardiovascular, diseases, there, are, two, types, of, unsaturated, oils, mono, and, poly, unsaturated, fats, both, of, which, are, recognized, as, beneficial, to, health, in, contrast, to, saturated, fats, some, widely, grown, vegetable, oils, such, as, canola, sunflower, safflower, and, olive, oils, contain, high, amounts, of, unsaturated, fats, during, the, manufacture, of, margarine, makers, may, convert, some, unsaturated, fat, into, hydrogenated, fats, or, trans, fats, to, give, them, a, higher, melting, point, so, they, stay, solid, at, room, temperatures, unlike, essential, fatty, acids, trans, fatty, acids, are, not, essential, and, provide, no, known, benefit, to, human, health, besides, providing, calories, there, is, a, positive, linear, trend, between, trans, fatty, acid, intake, and, ldl, cholesterol, concentration, and, therefore, increased, risk, of, coronary, heart, disease, by, raising, levels, of, ldl, cholesterol, and, lowering, levels, of, hdl, cholesterol, several, large, studies, have, indicated, a, link, between, consumption, of, high, amounts, of, trans, fat, and, coronary, heart, disease, and, possibly, some, other, diseases, prompting, a, number, of, government, health, agencies, across, the, world, to, recommend, that, the, intake, of, trans, fats, be, minimized, in, the, united, states, partial, hydrogenation, has, been, common, as, a, result, of, preference, for, domestically, produced, oils, however, since, the, mid, 1990s, many, countries, have, started, to, move, away, from, using, partially, hydrogenated, oils, this, led, to, the, production, of, new, margarine, varieties, that, contain, less, or, no, trans, fat, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, ordered, that, trans, fat, is, to, be, eliminated, from, food, processing, after, a, three, year, grace, period, beginning, in, june, 2015, to, then, be, implemented, by, 18, june, 2018, high, levels, of, cholesterol, particularly, low, density, lipoprotein, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, atherosclerosis, and, atheroma, formation, the, narrowing, of, blood, vessels, can, cause, reduced, blood, flow, to, the, brain, heart, kidneys, and, other, parts, of, the, body, cholesterol, though, needed, metabolically, is, not, essential, in, the, diet, because, the, body, s, production, increases, as, needed, when, dietary, intake, falls, the, human, body, makes, cholesterol, in, the, liver, adapting, the, production, according, to, its, food, intake, producing, about, 1, g, of, cholesterol, each, day, or, 80, of, the, needed, total, body, cholesterol, the, remaining, 20, comes, directly, from, food, intake, overall, intake, of, cholesterol, as, food, has, less, effect, on, blood, cholesterol, levels, than, the, type, of, fat, eaten, most, margarines, are, vegetable, based, and, thus, contain, no, cholesterol, while, a, teaspoon, 5, grams, of, butter, contains, 10, 8, mg, of, cholesterol, plant, sterol, esters, or, plant, stanol, esters, have, been, added, to, some, margarines, and, spreads, because, of, their, cholesterol, lowering, effect, several, studies, have, indicated, that, consumption, of, about, 2, grams, per, day, provides, a, reduction, in, ldl, cholesterol, of, about, 10, margarine, particularly, polyunsaturated, margarine, has, become, a, major, part, of, the, western, diet, and, had, overtaken, butter, in, popularity, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, for, example, in, 1930, the, average, person, ate, over, 18, lb, 8, 2, kg, of, butter, a, year, and, just, over, 2, lb, 0, 91, kg, of, margarine, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, an, average, american, ate, around, 5, lb, 2, 3, kg, of, butter, and, nearly, 8, lb, 3, 6, kg, of, margarine, consumers, may, choose, margarine, for, a, number, of, reasons, including, lower, cost, ease, of, availability, a, perception, primarily, relevant, for, vegetable, based, margarines, that, it, is, healthier, than, butter, a, desire, to, avoid, consuming, animal, based, products, of, particular, concern, for, vegans, and, also, based, on, the, assumption, that, the, margarine, is, vegetable, based, and, or, a, simple, personal, preference, to, butter, and, or, other, spreads, on, account, of, taste, margarine, has, a, particular, market, value, to, those, who, observe, the, jewish, dietary, laws, of, kashrut, which, forbids, the, mixing, of, meat, and, dairy, products, hence, there, are, strictly, kosher, non, dairy, margarines, available, known, as, pareve, one, brand, known, to, the, kosher, keeping, public, is, fleischmann, s, margarine, these, are, often, used, by, the, kosher, observant, consumers, to, adapt, recipes, that, use, meat, and, butter, or, in, baked, goods, served, with, meat, meals, the, 2008, passover, margarine, shortage, in, america, caused, much, consternation, within, the, kosher, observant, community, regular, margarine, contains, trace, amounts, of, animal, products, such, as, whey, or, dairy, casein, extracts, however, margarine, that, strictly, does, not, contain, animal, products, also, exists, such, margarines, provide, a, vegan, substitute, for, butter, margarine, is, common, in, australian, supermarkets, sales, of, the, product, have, decreased, in, recent, years, due, to, consumers, reducing, their, use, of, spreads, in, their, daily, diet, butter, colored, margarine, was, sold, from, its, introduction, in, australia, but, dairy, and, associated, industries, lobbied, governments, strongly, in, a, vain, attempt, to, have, them, change, its, color, or, banned, altogether, australia, new, zealand, food, standards, code, standard, 2, 4, 2, edible, oil, spreads, requires, that, edible, oil, spreads, and, table, margarine, must, contain, no, less, than, 55, g, kg, of, vitamin, d, canadian, standard, b, 09, 016, states, that, margarine, shall, be, an, emulsion, of, fat, or, water, in, fat, oil, or, fat, and, oil, that, are, not, derived, from, milk,

buttermilk, ii, whey, solids, or, modified, whey, solids, calorie, reduced, margarine, is, specified, in, standard, b, 09, 017, as, containing, not, less, than, 40, fat, and, having, 50, of, the, calories, normally, present, in, margarine, in, 2007, health, canada, released, an, updated, version, of, the, canada, s, food, guide, that, recommended, canadians, choose, soft, margarine, spreads, that, are, low, in, saturated, and, trans, fats, and, limit, traditional, hard, margarines, butter, lard, and, shortening, in, their, diets, under, european, union, directives, distinguishes, between, spreadable, fats, a, water, in, oil, emulsion, derived, from, vegetable, animal, fats, with, a, fat, content, of, at, least, 10, but, less, than, 90, that, remain, solid, at, a, temperature, of, 20, c, and, are, suitable, as, spread, and, margarine, to, avoid, any, possible, confusion, the, regulation, limits, the, use, of, the, terms, butter, and, margarine, to, products, with, a, fat, content, of, not, less, than, 80, margarines, may, not, have, a, milk, fat, content, of, more, than, 3, for, blends, and, blended, spreads, the, milk, fat, may, be, between, 10, and, 80, spread, that, contains, 60, to, 62, of, fat, may, be, called, three, quarter, fat, margarine, or, reduced, fat, margarine, spread, that, contains, 39, to, 41, of, fat, may, be, called, half, fat, margarine, low, fat, margarine, or, light, margarine, spreads, with, any, other, percentage, of, fat, are, called, fat, spread, or, light, spread, many, member, states, currently, require, the, mandatory, addition, of, vitamins, a, and, d, to, margarine, and, fat, spreads, for, reasons, of, public, health, voluntary, fortification, of, margarine, with, vitamins, had, been, practiced, by, manufacturers, since, 1925, but, in, 1940, with, the, advent, of, the, war, certain, governments, took, action, to, safeguard, the, nutritional, status, of, their, nations, by, making, the, addition, of, vitamin, a, and, d, compulsory, this, mandatory, fortification, was, justified, in, the, view, that, margarine, was, being, used, to, replace, butter, in, the, diet, in, the, united, kingdom, no, brands, of, spread, on, sale, contain, partially, hydrogenated, oils, fortification, with, vitamins, a, and, d, is, no, longer, mandatory, for, margarine, this, brings, it, in, line, with, other, spreads, wherein, fortification, is, not, required, since, margarine, intrinsically, appears, white, or, almost, white, by, preventing, the, addition, of, artificial, coloring, agents, legislators, found, they, could, protect, the, dairy, industries, by, discouraging, the, consumption, of, margarine, based, on, visual, appeal, if, margarine, were, colored, the, same, as, butter, consumers, would, see, it, as, being, virtually, the, same, thing, as, butter, and, as, a, quasi, natural, product, bans, on, adding, color, became, commonplace, in, the, united, states, canada, and, denmark, and, in, some, cases, those, bans, endured, for, almost, 100, years, the, rivalry, between, the, dairy, industry, and, the, oleomargarine, industry, persists, even, today, in, canada, margarine, was, prohibited, from, 1886, to, 1948, though, this, ban, was, temporarily, lifted, from, 1917, until, 1923, due, to, dairy, shortages, nevertheless, bootleg, margarine, was, produced, in, the, neighboring, dominion, of, newfoundland, from, whale, seal, and, fish, oil, by, the, newfoundland, butter, company, and, was, smuggled, to, canada, where, it, was, widely, sold, for, half, the, price, of, butter, the, supreme, court, of, canada, lifted, the, margarine, ban, in, 1948, in, the, margarine, reference, that, year, newfoundland, negotiated, its, entry, into, the, canadian, confederation, and, one, of, its, three, non, negotiable, conditions, for, union, with, canada, was, a, constitutional, protection, for, the, new, province, s, right, to, manufacture, margarine, in, 1950, as, a, result, of, a, court, ruling,
