surfing, is, a, surface, water, sport, in, which, an, individual, a, surfer, or, two, in, tandem, surfing, uses, a, board, to, ride, on, the, forward, section, or, face, of, a, moving, wave, of, water, which, usually, carries, the, surfer, towards, the, shore, waves, suitable, for, surfing, are, primarily, found, on, ocean, shores, but, can, also, be, found, as, standing, waves, in, the, open, ocean, in, lakes, in, rivers, in, the, form, of, a, tidal, bore, or, in, wave, pools, the, term, surfing, refers, to, a, person, riding, a, wave, using, a, board, regardless, of, the, stance, there, are, several, types, of, boards, the, moche, of, peru, would, often, surf, on, reed, craft, while, the, native, peoples, of, the, pacific, surfed, waves, on, alaia, paipo, and, other, such, water, craft, ancient, cultures, often, surfed, on, their, belly, and, knees, while, the, modern, day, definition, of, surfing, most, often, refers, to, a, surfer, riding, a, wave, standing, on, a, surfboard, this, is, also, referred, to, as, stand, up, surfing, another, prominent, form, of, surfing, is, body, boarding, where, a, surfer, rides, the, wave, on, a, bodyboard, either, lying, on, their, belly, drop, knee, one, foot, and, one, knee, on, the, board, or, sometimes, even, standing, up, on, a, body, board, other, types, of, surfing, include, knee, boarding, surf, matting, riding, inflatable, mats, and, using, foils, body, surfing, in, which, the, wave, is, caught, and, ridden, using, the, surfer, s, own, body, rather, than, a, board, is, very, common, and, is, considered, by, some, surfers, to, be, the, purest, form, of, surfing, the, closest, form, of, body, surfing, using, a, board, is, a, handboard, which, normally, has, one, strap, over, it, to, fit, on, one, hand, surfers, who, body, board, body, surf, or, handboard, feel, more, drag, as, they, move, through, the, water, than, stand, up, surfers, do, this, holds, body, surfers, into, a, more, turbulent, part, of, the, wave, often, completely, submerged, by, whitewater, in, contrast, surfers, who, instead, ride, a, hydrofoil, feel, substantially, less, drag, and, may, ride, unbroken, waves, in, the, open, ocean, three, major, subdivisions, within, stand, up, surfing, are, stand, up, paddling, long, boarding, and, short, boarding, with, several, major, differences, including, the, board, design, and, length, the, riding, style, and, the, kind, of, wave, that, is, ridden, in, tow, in, surfing, most, often, but, not, exclusively, associated, with, big, wave, surfing, a, motorized, water, vehicle, such, as, a, personal, watercraft, tows, the, surfer, into, the, wave, front, helping, the, surfer, match, a, large, wave, s, speed, which, is, generally, a, higher, speed, than, a, self, propelled, surfer, can, produce, surfing, related, sports, such, as, paddle, boarding, and, sea, kayaking, that, are, self, propelled, by, hand, paddles, do, not, require, waves, and, other, derivative, sports, such, as, kite, surfing, and, windsurfing, rely, primarily, on, wind, for, power, yet, all, of, these, platforms, may, also, be, used, to, ride, waves, recently, with, the, use, of, v, drive, boats, wakesurfing, in, which, one, surfs, on, the, wake, of, a, boat, has, emerged, as, of, 2023, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, recognized, a, 26, 2, m, 86, ft, wave, ride, by, sebastian, steudtner, at, nazar, portugal, as, the, largest, wave, ever, surfed, during, the, winter, season, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, north, shore, of, oahu, the, third, largest, island, of, hawaii, is, known, for, having, some, of, the, best, waves, in, the, world, surfers, from, around, the, world, flock, to, breaks, like, backdoor, waimea, bay, and, pipeline, however, there, are, still, many, popular, surf, spots, around, the, world, teahupo, o, located, off, the, coast, of, tahiti, mavericks, california, united, states, cloudbreak, tavarua, island, fiji, superbank, gold, coast, australia, in, 2016, surfing, was, added, by, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, as, an, olympic, sport, to, begin, at, the, 2020, summer, olympics, in, japan, the, first, gold, medalists, of, the, tokyo, 2020, surfing, men, and, women, s, competitions, were, respectively, the, brazilian, talo, ferreira, and, the, american, from, hawaii, carissa, moore, about, three, to, five, thousand, years, ago, cultures, in, ancient, peru, fished, in, kayak, like, watercraft, mochica, made, of, reeds, that, the, fishermen, surfed, back, to, shore, the, moche, culture, used, the, caballito, de, totora, little, horse, of, totora, with, archaeological, evidence, showing, its, use, around, 200, ce, an, early, description, of, the, inca, surfing, in, callao, was, documented, by, jesuit, missionary, jos, de, acosta, in, his, 1590, publication, historia, natural, y, moral, de, las, indias, writing, it, is, true, to, see, them, go, fishing, in, callao, de, lima, was, for, me, a, thing, of, great, recreation, because, there, were, many, and, each, one, in, a, balsilla, caballero, or, sitting, stubbornly, cutting, the, waves, of, the, sea, which, is, rough, where, they, fish, they, looked, like, the, tritons, or, neptunes, who, paint, upon, the, water, in, polynesian, culture, surfing, was, an, important, activity, modern, surfing, as, we, know, it, today, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, hawaii, the, history, of, surfing, dates, to, c, ad, 400, in, polynesia, where, polynesians, began, to, make, their, way, to, the, hawaiian, islands, from, tahiti, and, the, marquesas, islands, they, brought, many, of, their, customs, with, them, including, playing, in, the, surf, on, paipo, belly, body, boards, it, was, in, hawaii, that, the, art, of, standing, and, surfing, upright, on, boards, was, invented, various, european, explorers, witnessed, surfing, in, polynesia, surfing, may, have, been, observed, by, british, explorers, at, tahiti, in, 1767, samuel, wallis, and, the, crew, members, of, hms, dolphin, were, the, first, britons, to, visit, the, island, in, june, of, that, year, another, candidate, is, the, botanist, joseph, banks, who, was, part, of, the, first, voyage, of, james, cook, on, hms, endeavour, arriving, on, tahiti, on, 10, april, 1769, lieutenant, james, king, was, the, first, person, to, write, about, the, art, of, surfing, on, hawaii, when, he, was, completing, the, journals, of, captain, james, cook, upon, cook, s, death, in, 1779, in, herman, melville, s, 1849, novel, mardi, based, on, his, experiences, in, polynesia, earlier, that,

convex, on, both, sides, highly, polished, and, rounded, at, the, ends, it, is, held, in, high, estimation, invariably, oiled, after, use, and, hung, up, conspicuously, in, the, dwelling, of, the, owner, when, mark, twain, visited, hawaii, in, 1866, he, wrote, in, one, place, we, came, upon, a, large, company, of, naked, natives, of, both, sexes, and, all, ages, amusing, themselves, with, the, national, pastime, of, surf, bathing, references, to, surf, riding, on, planks, and, single, canoe, hulls, are, also, verified, for, pre, contact, samoa, where, surfing, was, called, fa, ase, e, or,

shaped, redwood, boards, according, to, surf, historians, kim, stoner, and, geoff, dunn, in, 1890, the, pioneer, in, agricultural, education, john, wrightson, reputedly, became, the, first, british, surfer, when, instructed, by, two, hawaiian, students, at, his, college, george, freeth, 1883, 1919, is, generally, credited, as, the, person, who, had, done, more, than, anyone, else, to, renew, interest, in, surfing, at, waikiki, in, the, early, twentieth, century, after, the, sport, had, declined, in, popularity, in, hawaii, during, the, latter, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, 1907, the, eclectic, interests, of, land, developer, abbot, kinney, founder, of, venice, of, america, now, venice, california, helped, bring, freeth, to, california, freeth, had, sought, the, help, of, the, hawaii, promotion, committee, hpc, in, honolulu, to, sponsor, him, on, a, trip, to, california, to, give, surfing, exhibitions, the, hpc, arranged, through, their, contacts, in, los, angeles, to, secure, a, contract, for, freeth, to, perform, at, venice, of, america, in, july, 1907, later, that, year, land, baron, henry, e, huntington, brought, surfing, to, redondo, beach, looking, for, a, way, to, entice, visitors, to, his, own, budding, resort, community, south, of, venice, where, he, had, heavily, invested, in, real, estate, he, hired, freeth, as, a, lifeguard, and, to, give, surfing, exhibitions, in, front, of, the, hotel, redondo, another, native, hawaiian, duke, kahanamoku, spread, surfing, to, both, the, u, s, and, australia, riding, the, waves, after, displaying, the, swimming, prowess, that, won, him, olympic, gold, medals, in, 1912, and, 1920, in, 1975, a, professional, tour, started, that, year, margo, oberg, became, the, first, female, professional, surfer, swell, is, generated, when, the, wind, blows, consistently, over, a, large, space, of, open, water, called, the, wind, s, fetch, the, size, of, a, swell, is, determined, by, the, strength, of, the, wind, and, the, length, of, its, fetch, and, duration, because, of, these, factors, the, surf, tends, to, be, larger, and, more, prevalent, on, coastlines, exposed, to, large, expanses, of, ocean, traversed, by, intense, low, pressure, systems, local, wind, conditions, affect, wave, quality, since, the, surface, of, a, wave, can, become, choppy, in, blustery, conditions, ideal, conditions, include, a, light, to, moderate, offshore, wind, because, it, blows, into, the, front, of, the, wave, making, it, a, barrel, or, tube, wave, waves, are, left, handed, and, right, handed, depending, upon, the, breaking, formation, of, the, wave, waves, are, generally, recognized, by, the, surfaces, over, which, they, break, for, example, there, are, beach, breaks, reef, breaks, and, point, breaks, the, most, important, influence, on, wave, shape, is, the, topography, of, the, seabed, directly, behind, and, immediately, beneath, the, breaking, wave, each, break, is, different, since, each, location, s, underwater, topography, is, unique, at, beach, breaks, sandbanks, change, shape, from, week, to, week, surf, forecasting, is, aided, by, advances, in, information, technology, mathematical, modeling, graphically, depicts, the, size, and, direction, of, swells, around, the, globe, swell, regularity, varies, across, the, globe, and, throughout, the, year, during, winter, heavy, swells, are, generated, in, the, mid, latitudes, when, the, north, and, south, polar, fronts, shift, toward, the, equator, the, predominantly, westerly, winds, generate, swells, that, advance, eastward, so, waves, tend, to, be, largest, on, west, coasts, during, winter, months, however, an, endless, train, of, mid, latitude, cyclones, cause, the, isobars, to, become, undulated, redirecting, swells, at, regular, intervals, toward, the, tropics, east, coasts, also, receive, heavy, winter, swells, when, low, pressure, cells, form, in, the, sub, tropics, where, slow, moving, highs, inhibit, their, movement, these, lows, produce, a, shorter, fetch, than, polar, fronts, however, they, can, still, generate, heavy, swells, since, their, slower, movement, increases, the, duration, of, a, particular, wind, direction, the, variables, of, fetch, and, duration, both, influence, how, long, wind, acts, over, a, wave, as, it, travels, since, a, wave, reaching, the, end, of, a, fetch, behaves, as, if, the, wind, died, during, summer, heavy, swells, are, generated, when, cyclones, form, in, the, tropics, tropical, cyclones, form, over, warm, seas, so, their, occurrence, is, influenced, by, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, cycles, their, movements, are, unpredictable, surf, travel, and, some, surf, camps, offer, surfers, access, to, remote, tropical, locations, where, tradewinds, ensure, offshore, conditions, since, winter, swells, are, generated, by, mid, latitude, cyclones, their, regularity, coincides, with, the, passage, of, these, lows, swells, arrive, in, pulses, each, lasting, for, a, couple, of, days, with, a, few, days, between, each, swell, the, availability, of, free, model, data, from, the, noaa, has, allowed, the, creation, of, several, surf, forecasting, websites, tube, shape, is, defined, by, length, to, width, ratio, a, perfectly, cylindrical, vortex, has, a, ratio, of, 1, 1, other, forms, include, peel, or, peeling, off, as, a, descriptive, term, for, the, quality, of, a, break, has, been, defined, as, a, fast, clean, evenly, falling, curl, line, perfect, for, surfing, and, usually, found, at, pointbreaks, tube, speed, is, the, rate, of, advance, of, the, break, along, the, length, of, the, wave, and, is, the, speed, at, which, the, surfer, must, move, along, the, wave, to, keep, up, with, the, advance, of, the, tube, tube, speed, can, be, described, using, the, peel, angle, and, wave, celerity, peel, angle, is, the, angle, between, the, wave, front, and, the, horizontal, projection, of, the, point, of, break, over, time, which, in, a, regular, break, is, most, easily, represented, by, the, line, of, white, water, left, after, the, break, a, break, that, closes, out, or, breaks, all, at, once, along, its, length, leaves, white, water, parallel, to, the, wave, front, and, has, a, peel, angle, of, 0, this, is, unsurfable, as, it, would, require, infinite, speed, to, progress, along, the, face, fast, enough, to, keep, up, with, the, break, a, break, which, advances, along, the, wave, face, more, slowly, will, leave, a, line, of, new, white, water, at, an, angle, to, the, line, of, the, wave, face, where, in, most, cases, a, peel, angle, less, than, 25, is, too, fast, to, surf, the, type, of, break, depends, on, shoaling, rate, breaking, waves, can, be, classified, as, four, basic, types, spilling, b, 0, 4, plunging, 0, 4, b, 2, collapsing, b, 2, and, surging, b, 2, and, which, type, occurs, depends, on, the, slope, of, the, bottom, waves, suitable, for, surfing, break, as, spilling, or, plunging, types, and, when, they, also, have, a, suitable, peel, angle, their, value, for, surfing, is, enhanced, other, factors, such, as, wave, height, and, period, and, wind, strength, and, direction, can, also, influence, steepness, and, intensity, of, the, break, but, the, major, influence, on, the, type, and, shape, of, breaking, waves, is, determined, by, the, slope, of, the, seabed, before, the, break, the, breaker, type, index, and, iribarren, number, allow, classification, of, breaker, type, as, a, function, of, wave, steepness, and, seabed, slope, the, value, of, good, surf, in, attracting, surf, tourism, has, prompted, the, construction, of, artificial, reefs, and, sand, bars, artificial, surfing, reefs, can, be, built, with, durable, sandbags, or, concrete, and, resemble, a, submerged, breakwater, these, artificial, reefs, not, only, provide, a, surfing, location, but, also, dissipate, wave, energy, and, shelter, the, coastline, from, erosion, ships, such, as, seli, 1, that, have, accidentally, stranded, on, sandy, bottoms, can, create, sandbanks, that, give, rise, to, good, waves, an, artificial, reef, known, as, chevron, reef, was, constructed, in, el, segundo, california, in, hopes, of, creating, a, new, surfing, area, however, the, reef, failed, to, produce, any, quality, waves, and, was, removed, in, 2008, in, kovalam, south, west, india, an, artificial, reef, has, successfully, provided, the, local, community, with, a, quality, lefthander, stabilized, coastal, soil, erosion, and, provided, good, habitat, for, marine, life, asr, ltd, a, new, zealand, based, company, constructed, the, kovalam, reef, and, is, working, on, another, reef, in, boscombe, england, even, with, artificial, reefs, in, place, a, tourist, s, vacation, time, may, coincide, with, a, flat, spell, when, no, waves, are, available, completely, artificial, wave, pools, aim, to, solve, that, problem, by, controlling, all, the, elements, that, go, into, creating, perfect, surf, however, there, are, only, a, handful, of, wave, pools, that, can, simulate, good, surfing, waves, owing, primarily, to, construction, and, operation, costs, and, potential, liability, most, wave, pools, generate, waves, that, are, too, small, and, lack, the, power, necessary, to, surf, the, seagaia, ocean, dome, located, in, miyazaki, japan, was, an, example, of, a, surfable, wave, pool, able, to, generate, waves, with, up, to, 3, m, 10, ft, faces, the, specialized, pump, held, water, in, 20, vertical, tanks, positioned, along, the, back, edge, of, the, pool, this, allowed, the, waves, to, be, directed, as, they, approach, the, artificial, sea, floor, lefts, rights, and, a, frames, could, be, directed, from, this, pump, design, providing, for, rippable, surf, and, barrel, rides, the, ocean, dome, cost, about, 2, billion, to, build, and, was, expensive, to, maintain, the, ocean, dome, was, closed, in, 2007, in, england, construction, is, nearing, completion, on, the, wave, situated, near, bristol, which, will, enable, people, unable, to, get, to, the, coast, to, enjoy, the, waves, in, a, controlled, environment, set, in, the, heart, of, nature, there, are, two, main, types, of, artificial, waves, that, exist, today, one, being, artificial, or, stationary, waves, which, simulate, a, moving, breaking, wave, by, pumping, a, layer, of, water, against, a, smooth, structure, mimicking, the, shape, of, a, breaking, wave, because, of, the, velocity, of, the, rushing, water, the, wave, and, the, surfer, can, remain, stationary, while, the, water, rushes, by, under, the, surfboard, artificial, waves, of, this, kind, provide, the, opportunity, to, try, surfing, and, learn, its, basics, in, a, moderately, small, and, controlled, environment, near, or, far, from, locations, with, natural, surf, standup, surfing, begins, when, the, surfer, paddles, toward, shore, in, an, attempt, to, match, the, speed, of, the, wave, the, same, applies, whether, the, surfer, is, standup, paddling, bodysurfing, boogie, boarding, or, using, some, other, type, of, watercraft, such, as, a, waveski, or, kayak, once, the, wave, begins, to, carry, the, surfer, forward, the, surfer, stands, up, and, proceeds, to, ride, the, wave, the, basic, idea, is, to, position, the, surfboard, so, it, is, just, ahead, of, the, breaking, part, whitewash, of, the, wave, in, the, so, called, pocket, it, is, difficult, for, beginners, to, catch, the, wave, at, all, surfers, skills, are, tested, by, their, ability, to, control, their, board, in, difficult, conditions, riding, challenging, waves, and, executing, maneuvers, such, as, strong, turns, and, cutbacks, turning, board, back, to, the, breaking, wave, and, carving, a, series, of, strong, back, to, back, maneuvers, more, advanced, skills, include, the, floater, riding, on, top, of, the, breaking, curl, of, the, wave, and, off, the, lip, banking, off, crest, of, the, breaking, wave, a, newer, addition, to, surfing, is, the, progression, of, the, air, whereby, a, surfer, propels, off, the, wave, entirely, up, into, the, air, and, then, successfully, lands, the, board, back, on, the, wave, the, tube, ride, is, considered, to, be, the, ultimate, maneuver, in, surfing, as, a, wave, breaks, if, the, conditions, are, ideal, the, wave, will, break, in, an, orderly, line, from, the, middle, to, the, shoulder, enabling, the, experienced, surfer, to, position, themselves, inside, the, wave, as, it, is, breaking, this, is, known, as, a, tube, ride, viewed, from, the, shore, the, tube, rider, may, disappear, from, view, as, the, wave, breaks, over, the, rider, s, head, the, longer, the, surfer, remains, in, the, tube, the, more, successful, the, ride, this, is, referred, to, as, getting, tubed, barrelled, shacked, or, pitted, some, of, the, world, s, best, known, waves, for, tube, riding, include, pipeline, on, the, north, shore, of, oahu, teahupoo, in, tahiti, and, g, land, in, java, other, names, for, the, tube, include, the, barrel, and, the, pit, hanging, ten, and, hanging, five, are, moves, usually, specific, to, longboarding, hanging, ten, refers, to, having, both, feet, on, the, front, end, of, the, board, with, all, of, the, surfer, s, toes, off, the, edge, also, known, as, nose, riding, hanging, five, is, having, just, one, foot, near, the, front, with, five, toes, off, the, edge, cutback, generating, speed, down, the, line, and, then, turning, back, to, reverse, direction, snap, quickly, turning, along, the, face, or, top, of, the, wave, almost, as, if, snapping, the, board, back, towards, the, wave, typically, done, on, steeper, waves, blowtail, pushing, the, tail, of, the, board, out, of, the, back, of, the, wave, so, that, the, fins, leave, the, water, floater, suspending, the, board, atop, the, wave, very, popular, on, small, waves, top, turn, turn, off, the, top, of, the, wave, sometimes, used, to, generate, speed, and, sometimes, to, shoot, spray, bottom, turn, a, turn, at, the, bottom, or, mid, face, of, the, wave, this, maneuver, is, used, to, set, up, other, maneuvers, such, as, the, top, turn, cutback, and, even, aerials, airs, aerials, these, maneuvers, have, been, becoming, more, and, more, prevalent, in, the, sport, in, both, competition, and, free, surfing, an, air, is, when, the, surfer, can, achieve, enough, speed, and, approach, a, certain, type, of, section, of, a, wave, that, is, supposed, to, act, as, a, ramp, and, launch, the, surfer, above, the, lip, line, of, the, wave, catching, air, and, landing, either, in, the, transition, of, the, wave, or, the, whitewash, when, hitting, a, close, out, section, airs, can, either, be, straight, airs, or, rotational, airs, straight, airs, have, minimal, rotation, if, any, but, definitely, no, more, rotation, than, 90, degrees, rotational, airs, require, a, rotation, of, 90, degrees, or, more, depending, on, the, level, of, the, surfer, types, of, rotations, the, glossary, of, surfing, includes, some, of, the, extensive, vocabulary, used, to, describe, various, aspects, of, the, sport, of, surfing, as, described, in, literature, on, the, subject, in, some, cases, terms, have, spread, to, a, wider, cultural, use, these, terms, were, originally, coined, by, people, who, were, directly, involved, in, the, sport, of, surfing, many, popular, surfing, destinations, have, surf, schools, and, surf, camps, that, offer, lessons, surf, camps, for, beginners, and, intermediates, are, multi, day, lessons, that, focus, on, surfing, fundamentals, they, are, designed, to, take, new, surfers, and, help, them, become, proficient, riders, all, inclusive, surf, camps, offer, overnight, accommodations, meals, lessons, and, surfboards, most, surf, lessons, begin, with, instruction, and, a, safety, briefing, on, land, followed, by, instructors, helping, students, into, waves, on, longboards, or, softboards, the, softboard, is, considered, the, ideal, surfboard, for, learning, due, to, the, fact, it, is, safer, and, has, more, paddling, speed, and, stability, than, shorter, boards, funboards, are, also, a, popular, shape, for, beginners, as, they, combine, the, volume, and, stability, of, the, longboard, with, the, manageable, size, of, a, smaller, surfboard, new, and, inexperienced, surfers, typically, learn, to, catch, waves, on, softboards, around, the, 210, to, 240, cm, 7, to, 8, ft, funboard, size, due, to, the, softness, of, the, surfboard, the, chance, of, getting, injured, is, substantially, minimized, typical, surfing, instruction, is, best, performed, one, on, one, but, can, also, be, done, in, a, group, setting, post, covid, there, s, been, a, shift, towards, online, and, land, based, surf, coaching, and, training, online, surf, coaching, is, allowing, surfers, to, learn, at, their, own, pace, and, convenience, from, anywhere, land, based, training, such, as, skateboard, simulations, offers, a, way, to, practice, maneuvers, repeatedly, refining, techniques, with, the, guidance, of, professional, coaches, either, in, person, or, remotely, using, video, analysis, apps, the, most, popular, surf, locations, offer, perfect, surfing, conditions, for, beginners, as, well, as, challenging, breaks, for, advanced, students, the, ideal, conditions, for, learning, would, be, small, waves, that, crumble, and, break, softly, as, opposed, to, the, steep, fast, peeling, waves, desired, by, more, experienced, surfers, when, available, a, sandy, seabed, is, generally, safer, surfing, can, be, broken, into, several, skills, paddling, strength, positioning, to, catch, the, wave, timing, and, balance, paddling, out, requires, strength, but, also, the, mastery, of, techniques, to, break, through, oncoming, waves, duck, diving, eskimo, roll, also, known, as, turtle, take, off, positioning, requires, experience, at, predicting, the, wave, set, and, where, it, will, break, the, surfer, must, pop, up, quickly, as, soon, as, the, wave, starts, pushing, the, board, forward, preferred, positioning, on, the, wave, is, determined, by, experience, at, reading, wave, features, including, where, the, wave, is, breaking, balance, plays, a, crucial, role, in, standing, on, a, surfboard, thus, balance, training, exercises, are, good, preparation, practicing, with, a, balance, board, longboard, skateboard, surfskate, or, swing, board, helps, novices, master, the, art, of, surfing, however, it, s, important, to, note, that, these, land, based, training, methods, have, faced, criticism, within, the, surf, coaching, community, concerns, include, the, potential, for, developing, poor, surfing, style, and, habits, such, as, excessive, wiggling, due, to, training, on, flat, surfaces, which, do, not, accurately, mimic, the, dynamic, nature, of, ocean, waves, to, address, these, limitations, training, in, a, skate, bowl, is, recommended, skate, bowls, can, offer, a, more, realistic, simulation, of, the, centrifugal, forces, experienced, while, surfing, this, type, of, training, helps, in, developing, better, control, and, style, by, replicating, the, curved, wave, like, shapes, and, motions, surfers, encounter, in, the, water, integrating, skate, bowl, training, can, provide, a, more, comprehensive, preparation, for, the, surfing, experience, balancing, the, benefits, of, basic, balance, training, with, the, nuances, of, wave, dynamics, the, repetitive, cycle, of, paddling, popping, up, and, balancing, requires, stamina, and, physical, strength, having, a, proper, warm, up, routine, can, help, prevent, injuries, surfing, can, be, done, on, various, equipment, including, surfboards, longboards, stand, up, paddle, boards, sups, bodyboards, wave, skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf, mats, and, macca, s, trays, surfboards, were, originally, made, of, solid, wood, and, were, large, and, heavy, often, up, to, 370, cm, 12, ft, long, and, having, a, mass, of, 70, kg, 150, lb, lighter, balsa, wood, surfboards, first, made, in, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, were, a, significant, improvement, not, only, in, portability, but, also, in, increasing, maneuverability, most, modern, surfboards, are, made, of, fiberglass, foam, pu, with, one, or, more, wooden, strips, or, stringers, fiberglass, cloth, and, polyester, resin, pe, an, emerging, board, material, is, epoxy, resin, and, expanded, polystyrene, foam, eps, which, is, stronger, and, lighter, than, traditional, pu, pe, construction, even, newer, designs, incorporate, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, and, variable, flex, composites, in, conjunction, with, fiberglass, and, epoxy, or, polyester, resins, since, epoxy, eps, surfboards, are, generally, lighter, they, will, float, better, than, a, traditional, pu, pe, board, of, similar, size, shape, and, thickness, this, makes, them, easier, to, paddle, and, faster, in, the, water, however, a, common, complaint, of, eps, boards, is, that, they, do, not, provide, as, much, feedback, as, a, traditional, pu, pe, board, for, this, reason, many, advanced, surfers, prefer, that, their, surfboards, be, made, from, traditional, materials, other, equipment, includes, a, leash, to, stop, the, board, from, drifting, away, after, a, wipeout, and, to, prevent, it, from, hitting, other, surfers, surf, wax, traction, pads, to, keep, a, surfer, s, feet, from, slipping, off, the, deck, of, the, board, and, fins, also, known, as, skegs, which, can, either, be, permanently, attached, glassed, on, or, interchangeable, sportswear, designed, or, particularly, suitable, for, surfing, may, be, sold, as, boardwear, the, term, is, also, used, in, snowboarding, in, warmer, climates, swimsuits, surf, trunks, or, boardshorts, are, worn, and, occasionally, rash, guards, in, cold, water, surfers, can, opt, to, wear, wetsuits, boots, hoods, and, gloves, to, protect, them, against, lower, water, temperatures, a, newer, introduction, is, a, rash, vest, with, a, thin, layer, of, titanium, to, provide, maximum, warmth, without, compromising, mobility, in, recent, years, there, have, been, advancements, in, technology, that, have, allowed, surfers, to, pursue, even, bigger, waves, with, added, elements, of, safety, big, wave, surfers, are, now, experimenting, with, inflatable, vests, or, colored, dye, packs, to, help, decrease, their, odds, of, drowning, there, are, many, different, surfboard, sizes, shapes, and, designs, in, use, today, modern, longboards, generally, 270, to, 300, cm, 9, to, 10, ft, in, length, are, reminiscent, of, the, earliest, surfboards, but, now, benefit, from, modern, innovations, in, surfboard, shaping, and, fin, design, competitive, longboard, surfers, need, to, be, competent, at, traditional, walking, manoeuvres, as, well, as, the, short, radius, turns, normally, associated, with, shortboard, surfing, the, modern, shortboard, began, life, in, the, late, 1960s, and, has, evolved, into, today, s, common, thruster, style, defined, by, its, three, fins, usually, around, 180, to, 210, cm, 6, to, 7, ft, in, length, the, thruster, was, invented, by, australian, shaper, simon, anderson, midsize, boards, often, called, funboards, provide, more, maneuverability, than, a, longboard, with, more, flotation, than, a, shortboard, while, many, surfers, find, that, funboards, live, up, to, their, name, providing, the, best, of, both, surfing, modes, others, are, critical, there, are, also, various, niche, styles, such, as, the, egg, a, longboard, style, short, board, targeted, at, people, who, want, to, ride, a, shortboard, but, need, more, paddle, power, the, fish, a, board, that, is, typically, shorter, flatter, and, wider, than, a, normal, shortboard, often, with, a, split, tail, known, as, a, swallow, tail, the, fish, often, has, two, or, four, fins, and, is, specifically, designed, for, surfing, smaller, waves, for, big, waves, there, is, the, gun, a, long, thick, board, with, a, pointed, nose, and, tail, known, as, a, pintail, specifically, designed, for, big, waves, the, physics, of, surfing, involves, the, physical, oceanographic, properties, of, wave, creation, in, the, surf, zone, the, characteristics, of, the, surfboard, and, the, surfer, s, interaction, with, the, water, and, the, board, ocean, waves, are, defined, as, a, collection, of, dislocated, water, parcels, that, undergo, a, cycle, of, being, forced, past, their, normal, position, and, being, restored, back, to, their, normal, position, wind, causes, ripples, and, eddies, to, form, waves, that, gradually, gain, speed, and, distance, fetch, waves, increase, in, energy, and, speed, and, then, become, longer, and, stronger, the, fully, developed, sea, has, the, strongest, wave, action, that, experiences, storms, lasting, 10, hours, and, creates, 15, m, 49, 2, ft, wave, heights, in, the, open, ocean, the, waves, created, in, the, open, ocean, are, classified, as, deep, water, waves, deep, water, waves, have, no, bottom, interaction, and, the, orbits, of, these, water, molecules, are, circular, their, wavelength, is, short, relative, to, water, depth, and, the, velocity, decays, before, reaching, the, bottom, of, the, water, basin, deep, water, waves, are, waves, in, water, depths, greater, than, half, their, wavelengths, wind, forces, waves, to, break, in, the, deep, sea, deep, water, waves, travel, to, shore, and, become, shallow, water, waves, when, the, water, depth, is, less, than, half, of, their, wavelength, and, the, wave, motion, becomes, constrained, by, the, bottom, causing, the, orbit, paths, to, be, flattened, to, ellipses, the, bottom, exerts, a, frictional, drag, on, the, bottom, of, the, wave, which, decreases, the, celerity, or, the, speed, of, the, waveform, and, causes, refraction, slowing, the, wave, forces, it, to, shorten, which, increases, the, height, and, steepness, and, the, top, crest, falls, because, the, velocity, of, the, top, of, the, wave, becomes, greater, than, the, velocity, of, the, bottom, of, the, wave, where, the, drag, occurs, the, surf, zone, is, the, place, of, convergence, of, multiple, waves, types, creating, complex, wave, patterns, a, wave, suitable, for, surfing, results, from, maximum, speeds, of, 5, metres, per, second, 16, ft, s, this, speed, is, relative, because, local, onshore, winds, can, cause, waves, to, break, in, the, surf, zone, shallow, water, waves, are, carried, by, global, winds, to, the, beach, and, interact, with, local, winds, to, make, surfing, waves, different, onshore, and, off, shore, wind, patterns, in, the, surf, zone, create, different, types, of, waves, onshore, winds, cause, random, wave, breaking, patterns, and, are, more, suitable, for, experienced, surfers, light, offshore, winds, create, smoother, waves, while, strong, direct, offshore, winds, cause, plunging, or, large, barrel, waves, barrel, waves, are, large, because, the, water, depth, is, small, when, the, wave, breaks, thus, the, breaker, intensity, or, force, increases, and, the, wave, speed, and, height, increase, off, shore, winds, produce, non, surfable, conditions, by, flattening, a, weak, swell, weak, swell, is, made, from, surface, gravity, forces, and, has, long, wavelengths, surfing, waves, can, be, analyzed, using, the, following, parameters, breaking, wave, height, wave, peel, angle, wave, breaking, intensity, and, wave, section, length, the, breaking, wave, height, has, two, measurements, the, relative, heights, estimated, by, surfers, and, the, exact, measurements, done, by, physical, oceanographers, measurements, done, by, surfers, were, 1, 36, to, 2, 58, times, higher, than, the, measurements, done, by, scientists, the, scientifically, concluded, wave, heights, that, are, physically, possible, to, surf, are, 1, to, 20, m, 3, 3, to, 66, ft, the, wave, peel, angle, is, one, of, the, main, constituents, of, a, potential, surfing, wave, wave, peel, angle, measures, the, distance, between, the, peel, line, and, the, line, tangent, to, the, breaking, crest, line, this, angle, controls, the, speed, of, the, wave, crest, the, speed, of, the, wave, is, an, addition, of, the, propagation, velocity, vector, vw, and, peel, velocity, vector, vp, which, results, in, the, overall, velocity, of, the, wave, vs, wave, breaking, intensity, measures, the, force, of, the, wave, as, it, breaks, spills, or, plunges, a, plunging, wave, is, termed, by, surfers, as, a, barrel, wave, wave, section, length, is, the, distance, between, two, breaking, crests, in, a, wave, set, wave, section, length, can, be, hard, to, measure, because, local, winds, non, linear, wave, interactions, island, sheltering, and, swell, interactions, can, cause, multifarious, wave, configurations, in, the, surf, zone, the, parameters, breaking, wave, height, wave, peel, angle, and, wave, breaking, intensity, and, wave, section, length, are, important, because, they, are, standardized, by, past, oceanographers, who, researched, surfing, these, parameters, have, been, used, to, create, a, guide, that, matches, the, type, of, wave, formed, and, the, skill, level, of, surfer, table, 1, shows, a, relationship, of, smaller, peel, angles, correlating, with, a, higher, skill, level, of, the, surfer, smaller, wave, peel, angles, increase, the, velocities, of, waves, a, surfer, must, know, how, to, react, and, paddle, quickly, to, match, the, speed, of, the, wave, to, catch, it, therefore, more, experience, is, required, to, catch, low, peel, angle, waves, more, experienced, surfers, can, handle, longer, section, lengths, increased, velocities, and, higher, wave, heights, different, locations, offer, different, types, of, surfing, conditions, for, each, skill, level, a, surf, break, is, an, area, with, an, obstruction, or, an, object, that, causes, a, wave, to, break, surf, breaks, entail, multiple, scale, phenomena, wave, section, creation, has, microscale, factors, of, peel, angle, and, wave, breaking, intensity, the, micro, scale, components, influence, wave, height, and, variations, on, wave, crests, the, mesoscale, components, of, surf, breaks, are, the, ramp, platform, wedge, or, ledge, that, may, be, present, at, a, surf, break, macro, scale, processes, are, the, global, winds, that, initially, produce, offshore, waves, types, of, surf, breaks, are, headlands, point, break, beach, break, river, estuary, entrance, bar, reef, breaks, and, ledge, breaks, a, headland, or, point, break, interacts, with, the, water, by, causing, refraction, around, the, point, or, headland, the, point, absorbs, the, high, frequency, waves, and, long, period, waves, persist, which, are, easier, to, surf, examples, of, locations, that, have, headland, or, point, break, induced, surf, breaks, are, dunedin, new, zealand, raglan, new, zealand, malibu, california, rincon, california, and, kirra, australia, a, beach, break, is, an, area, of, open, coastline, where, the, waves, break, over, a, sand, bottom, they, are, the, most, common, yet, also, the, most, volatile, of, surf, breaks, wave, breaks, happen, successively, at, beach, breaks, as, in, there, are, multiple, peaks, to, surf, at, a, single, beach, break, location, example, locations, are, tairua, and, aramoana, beach, new, zealand, and, the, gold, coast, australia, a, river, or, estuary, entrance, bar, creates, waves, from, the, ebb, tidal, delta, sediment, outflow, and, tidal, currents, an, ideal, estuary, entrance, bar, exists, in, whangamata, bar, new, zealand, a, reef, break, is, conducive, to, surfing, because, large, waves, consistently, break, over, the, reef, the, reef, is, usually, made, of, coral, and, because, of, this, many, injuries, occur, while, surfing, reef, breaks, however, the, waves, that, are, produced, by, reef, breaks, are, some, of, the, best, in, the, world, famous, reef, breaks, are, present, in, padang, padang, indonesia, pipeline, hawaii, uluwatu, bali, and, teahupo, o, tahiti, a, ledge, break, is, formed, by, steep, rocks, ledges, that, make, intense, waves, because, the, waves, travel, through, deeper, water, then, abruptly, reach, shallower, water, at, the, ledge, shark, island, australia, is, a, location, with, a, ledge, break, ledge, breaks, create, difficult, surfing, conditions, sometimes, only, allowing, body, surfing, as, the, only, feasible, way, to, confront, the, waves, jetties, are, added, to, bodies, of, water, to, regulate, erosion, preserve, navigation, channels, and, make, harbors, jetties, are, classified, into, four, different, types, and, have, two, main, controlling, variables, the, type, of, delta, and, the, size, of, the, jetty, the, first, classification, is, a, type, 1, jetty, this, type, of, jetty, is, significantly, longer, than, the, surf, zone, width, and, the, waves, break, at, the, shore, end, of, the, jetty, the, effect, of, a, type, 1, jetty, is, sediment, accumulation, in, a, wedge, formation, on, the, jetty, these, waves, are, large, and, increase, in, size, as, they, pass, over, the, sediment, wedge, formation, an, example, of, a, type, 1, jetty, is, mission, beach, san, diego, california, this, 1000, meter, jetty, was, installed, in, 1950, at, the, mouth, of, mission, bay, the, surf, waves, happen, north, of, the, jetty, are, longer, waves, and, are, powerful, the, bathymetry, of, the, sea, bottom, in, mission, bay, has, a, wedge, shape, formation, that, causes, the, waves, to, refract, as, they, become, closer, to, the, jetty, the, waves, converge, constructively, after, they, refract, and, increase, the, sizes, of, the, waves, a, type, 2, jetty, occurs, in, an, ebb, tidal, delta, a, delta, transitioning, between, high, and, low, tide, this, area, has, shallow, water, refraction, and, distinctive, seabed, shapes, that, create, large, wave, heights, an, example, of, a, type, 2, jetty, is, called, the, poles, in, atlantic, beach, florida, atlantic, beach, is, known, to, have, flat, waves, with, exceptions, during, major, storms, however, the, poles, has, larger, than, normal, waves, due, to, a, 500, meter, jetty, that, was, installed, on, the, south, side, of, st, johns, this, jetty, was, built, to, make, a, deep, channel, in, the, river, it, formed, a, delta, at, the, poles, this, is, a, special, area, because, the, jetty, increases, wave, size, for, surfing, when, comparing, pre, conditions, and, post, conditions, of, the, southern, st, johns, river, mouth, area, the, wave, size, at, the, poles, depends, on, the, direction, of, the, incoming, water, when, easterly, waters, from, 55, interact, with, the, jetty, they, create, waves, larger, than, southern, waters, from, 100, when, southern, waves, from, 100, move, toward, the, poles, one, of, the, waves, breaks, north, of, the, southern, jetty, and, the, other, breaks, south, of, the, jetty, this, does, not, allow, for, merging, to, make, larger, waves, easterly, waves, from, 55, converge, north, of, the, jetty, and, unite, to, make, bigger, waves, a, type, 3, jetty, is, in, an, ebb, tidal, area, with, an, unchanging, seabed, that, has, naturally, created, waves, examples, of, a, type, 3, jetty, occurs, in, southside, tamarack, carlsbad, california, a, type, 4, jetty, is, one, that, no, longer, functions, nor, traps, sediment, the, waves, are, created, from, reefs, in, the, surf, zone, a, type, 4, jetty, can, be, found, in, tamarack, carlsbad, california, rip, currents, are, fast, narrow, currents, that, are, caused, by, onshore, transport, within, the, surf, zone, and, the, successive, return, of, the, water, seaward, the, wedge, bathymetry, makes, a, convenient, and, consistent, rip, current, of, 5, 10, meters, that, brings, the, surfers, to, the, take, off, point, then, out, to, the, beach, oceanographers, have, two, theories, on, rip, current, formation, the, wave, interaction, model, assumes, that, two, edges, of, waves, interact, create, differing, wave, heights, and, cause, longshore, transport, of, nearshore, currents, the, boundary, interaction, model, assumes, that, the, topography, of, the, sea, bottom, causes, nearshore, circulation, and, longshore, transport, the, result, of, both, models, is, a, rip, current, rip, currents, can, be, extremely, strong, and, narrow, as, they, extend, out, of, the, surf, zone, into, deeper, water, reaching, speeds, from, 0, 5, m, s, 1, 6, ft, s, and, up, to, 2, 5, m, s, 8, 2, ft, s, which, is, faster, than, any, human, can, swim, the, water, in, the, jet, is, sediment, rich, bubble, rich, and, moves, rapidly, the, rip, head, of, the, rip, current, has, long, shore, movement, rip, currents, are, common, on, beaches, with, mild, slopes, that, experience, sizeable, and, frequent, oceanic, swell, a, longer, surfboard, of, 300, cm, 10, ft, causes, more, friction, with, the, water, therefore, it, will, be, slower, than, a, smaller, and, lighter, board, with, a, length, of, 180, cm, 6, ft, longer, boards, are, good, for, beginners, who, need, help, balancing, smaller, boards, are, good, for, more, experienced, surfers, who, want, to, have, more, control, and, maneuverability, when, practicing, the, sport, of, surfing, the, surfer, paddles, out, past, the, wave, break, to, wait, for, a, wave, when, a, surfable, wave, arrives, the, surfer, must, paddle, extremely, fast, to, match, the, velocity, of, the, wave, so, the, wave, can, accelerate, him, or, her, when, the, surfer, is, at, wave, speed, the, surfer, must, quickly, pop, up, stay, low, and, stay, toward, the, front, of, the, wave, to, become, stable, and, prevent, falling, as, the, wave, steepens, the, acceleration, is, less, toward, the, front, than, toward, the, back, the, physics, behind, the, surfing, of, the, wave, involves, the, horizontal, acceleration, force, f, sin, and, the, vertical, force, f, cos, mg, therefore, the, surfer, should, lean, forward, to, gain, speed, and, lean, on, the, back, foot, to, brake, also, to, increase, the, length, of, the, ride, of, the, wave, the, surfer, should, travel, parallel, to, the, wave, crest, surfing, like, all, water, sports, carries, the, inherent, risk, of, drowning, although, the, board, assists, a, surfer, in, staying, buoyant, it, can, become, separated, from, the, user, a, leash, attached, to, the, ankle, or, knee, can, keep, a, board, from, being, swept, away, but, does, not, keep, a, rider, on, the, board, or, above, water, in, some, cases, possibly, including, the, drowning, of, professional, surfer, mark, foo, the, leash, can, be, a, cause, of, drowning, by, snagging, on, a, reef, or, other, object, and, holding, the, surfer, underwater, by, keeping, the, surfboard, close, to, the, surfer, during, a, wipeout, a, leash, also, increases, the, chances, that, the, board, may, strike, the, rider, which, could, knock, them, unconscious, and, lead, to, drowning, especially, with, a, hard, surfboard, instead, of, a, soft, surfboard, a, fallen, rider, s, board, can, become, trapped, in, larger, waves, and, if, the, rider, is, attached, by, a, leash, they, can, be, dragged, for, long, distances, underwater, surfers, should, be, careful, to, remain, in, smaller, surf, until, they, have, acquired, the, advanced, skills, and, experience, necessary, to, handle, bigger, waves, and, more, challenging, conditions, even, world, class, surfers, have, drowned, in, extremely, challenging, conditions, under, the, wrong, set, of, conditions, anything, that, a, surfer, s, body, can, come, in, contact, with, is, a, potential, hazard, including, sand, bars, rocks, small, ice, reefs, surfboards, and, other, surfers, collisions, with, these, objects, can, sometimes, cause, injuries, such, as, cuts, and, scrapes, and, in, rare, instances, death, a, large, number, of, injuries, up, to, 66, are, caused, by, collision, with, a, surfboard, nose, or, fins, fins, can, cause, deep, lacerations, and, cuts, as, well, as, bruising, while, these, injuries, can, be, minor, they, can, open, the, skin, to, infection, from, the, sea, groups, like, surfers, against, sewage, campaign, for, cleaner, waters, to, reduce, the, risk, of, infections, local, bugs, and, diseases, can, be, risk, factors, when, surfing, around, the, globe, falling, off, a, surfboard, or, colliding, with, others, is, commonly, referred, to, as, a, wipeout, sea, life, can, sometimes, cause, injuries, bethany, hamilton, and, even, fatalities, animals, such, as, sharks, stingrays, weever, fish, seals, and, jellyfish, can, sometimes, present, a, danger, warmer, water, surfers, often, do, the, stingray, shuffle, as, they, walk, out, through, the, shallows, shuffling, their, feet, in, the, sand, to, scare, away, stingrays, that, may, be, resting, on, the, bottom, rip, currents, are, water, channels, that, flow, away, from, the, shore, under, the, wrong, circumstances, these, currents, can, endanger, both, experienced, and, inexperienced, surfers, since, a, rip, current, appears, to, be, an, area, of, flat, water, tired, or, inexperienced, swimmers, or, surfers, may, enter, one, and, be, carried, out, beyond, the, breaking, waves, although, many, rip, currents, are, much, smaller, the, largest, rip, currents, have, a, width, of, 12, 15, m, 40, 50, ft, the, flow, of, water, moving, out, towards, the, sea, in, a, rip, will, be, stronger, than, most, swimmers, making, swimming, back, to, shore, difficult, however, by, paddling, parallel, to, the, shore, a, surfer, can, easily, exit, a, rip, current, alternatively, some, surfers, actually, ride, on, a, rip, current, because, it, is, a, fast, and,

antibiotic, resistant, e, coli, and, four, times, as, likely, to, harbor, other, bacteria, capable, of, easily, becoming, antibiotic, resistant, the, researchers, attributed, this, to, the, fact, that, surfers, swallow, roughly, ten, times, as, much, seawater, as, swimmers, surfers, sometimes, use, ear, protection, such, as, ear, plugs, to, avoid, surfer, s, ear, inflammation, of, the, ear,

are, primarily, made, to, keep, water, out, of, the, ear, thereby, letting, a, protective, pocket, of, air, stay, inside, the, ear, canal, they, can, also, block, cold, air, dirt, and, bacteria, many, designs, are, made, to, let, sound, through, and, either, float, and, or, have, a, leash, in, case, the, plug, accidentally, gets, bumped, out, surf, rash, appears, in, many, different, ways, on, the,
