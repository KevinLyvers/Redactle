gymnastics, champions, and, the, simultaneous, popularization, of, bodybuilding, magazines, training, principles, nutrition, for, bulking, up, and, cutting, down, the, use, of, protein, and, other, food, supplements, and, the, opportunity, to, enter, physique, contests, the, number, of, bodybuilding, organizations, grew, and, most, notably, the, international, federation, of, bodybuilders, ifbb, was, founded, in, 1946, by, canadian, brothers, joe, and, ben, weider, other, bodybuilding, organizations, included, the, amateur, athletic, union, aau, national, amateur, bodybuilding, association,

championships, the, most, prestigious, titles, were, mr, america, mr, world, mr, universe, mr, galaxy, and, ultimately, mr, olympia, which, was, started, in, 1965, by, the, ifbb, and, is, now, considered, the, most, important, bodybuilding, competition, in, the, world, during, the, 1950s, the, most, successful, and, most, famous, competing, bodybuilders, were, bill, pearl, reg, park, leroy, colbert, and, clarence, ross, certain, bodybuilders, rose, to, fame, thanks, to, the, relatively, new, medium, of, television, as, well, as, cinema, the, most, notable, were, jack, lalanne, steve, reeves, reg, park, and, mickey, hargitay, while, there, were, well, known, gyms, throughout, the, country, during, the, 1950s, such, as, vince, s, gym, in, north, hollywood, california, and, vic, tanny, s, chain, gyms, there, were, still, segments, of, the, united, states, that, had, no, hardcore, bodybuilding, gyms, until, the, advent, of, gold, s, gym, in, the, mid, 1960s, finally, the, famed, muscle, beach, in, santa, monica, continued, its, popularity, as, the, place, to, be, for, witnessing, acrobatic, acts, feats, of, strength, and, the, like, the, movement, grew, more, in, the, 1960s, with, increased, tv, and, movie, exposure, as, bodybuilders, were, typecast, in, popular, shows, and, movies, in, the, 1970s, bodybuilding, had, major, publicity, thanks, to, the, appearance, of, arnold, schwarzenegger, franco, columbu, lou, ferrigno, mike, mentzer, and, others, in, the, 1977, docudrama, pumping, iron, by, this, time, the, ifbb, dominated, the, competitive, bodybuilding, landscape, and, the, amateur, athletic, union, aau, took, a, back, seat, the, national, physique, committee, npc, was, formed, in, 1981, by, jim, manion, who, had, just, stepped, down, as, chairman, of, the, aau, physique, committee, the, npc, has, gone, on, to, become, the, most, successful, bodybuilding, organization, in, the, united, states, and, is, the, amateur, division, of, the, ifbb, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, saw, the, decline, of, aau, sponsored, bodybuilding, contests, in, 1999, the, aau, voted, to, discontinue, its, bodybuilding, events, this, period, also, saw, the, rise, of, anabolic, steroids, in, bodybuilding, and, many, other, sports, more, significant, use, began, with, arnold, schwarzenegger, sergio, oliva, and, lou, ferrigno, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, and, continuing, through, the, 1980s, with, lee, haney, the, 1990s, with, dorian, yates, ronnie, coleman, and, markus, r, hl, and, up, to, the, present, day, bodybuilders, such, as, greg, kovacs, attained, mass, and, size, never, seen, previously, but, were, not, successful, at, the, pro, level, others, were, renowned, for, their, spectacular, development, of, a, particular, body, part, like, tom, platz, or, paul, demayo, for, their, leg, muscles, at, the, time, of, shooting, pumping, iron, schwarzenegger, while, never, admitting, to, steroid, use, until, long, after, his, retirement, said, you, have, to, do, anything, you, can, to, get, the, advantage, in, competition, he, would, later, say, that, he, did, not, regret, using, steroids, to, combat, anabolic, steroid, use, and, in, the, hopes, of, becoming, a, member, of, the, ioc, the, ifbb, introduced, doping, tests, for, both, steroids, and, other, banned, substances, although, doping, tests, occurred, the, majority, of, professional, bodybuilders, still, used, anabolic, steroids, for, competition, during, the, 1970s, the, use, of, anabolic, steroids, was, openly, discussed, partly, due, to, the, fact, they, were, legal, in, the, anabolic, steroid, control, act, of, 1990, u, s, congress, placed, anabolic, steroids, into, schedule, iii, of, the, controlled, substances, act, csa, in, canada, steroids, are, listed, under, schedule, iv, of, the, controlled, drugs, and, substances, act, enacted, by, the, federal, parliament, in, 1996, in, 1990, professional, wrestling, promoter, vince, mcmahon, attempted, to, form, his, own, bodybuilding, organization, known, as, the, world, bodybuilding, federation, wbf, it, operated, as, a, sister, to, the, world, wrestling, federation, wwf, now, wwe, which, provided, cross, promotion, via, its, performers, and, personalities, tom, platz, served, as, the, wbf, s, director, of, talent, development, and, announced, the, new, organization, during, an, ambush, of, that, year, s, mr, olympia, which, unbeknownst, to, organizers, mcmahon, and, platz, had, attended, as, representatives, of, an, accompanying, magazine, bodybuilding, lifestyles, it, touted, efforts, to, bring, bigger, prize, money, and, more, dramatic, events, to, the, sport, of, bodybuilding, which, resulted, in, its, championships, being, held, as, pay, per, view, events, with, wwf, inspired, sports, entertainment, features, and, showmanship, the, organization, signed, high, valued, contracts, with, a, number, of, ifbb, regulars, the, ifbb, s, inaugural, championship, in, june, 1991, won, by, gary, strydom, received, mixed, reviews, the, wbf, would, be, indirectly, impacted, by, a, steroid, scandal, involving, the, wwf, prompting, the, organization, to, impose, a, drug, testing, policy, prior, to, the, 1992, championship, the, drug, testing, policy, hampered, the, quality, of, the, 1992, championship, while, attempts, to, increase, interest, by, hiring, wcw, wrestler, lex, luger, as, a, figurehead, hosting, a, wbf, television, program, on, usa, network, and, planning, to, make, a, guest, pose, during, the, 1992, championship, before, being, injured, in, a, motorcycle, accident, and, attempting, to, sign, lou, ferrigno, who, left, the, organization, shortly, after, the, drug, testing, policy, was, announced, did, not, come, to, fruition, the, second, ppv, received, a, minuscule, audience, and, the, wbf, dissolved, only, one, month, later, in, july, 1992, in, 2003, joe, weider, sold, weider, publications, to, american, media, inc, ami, the, position, of, president, of, the, ifbb, was, filled, by, rafael, santonja, following, the, death, of, ben, weider, in, october, 2008, in, 2004, contest, promoter, wayne, demilia, broke, ranks, with, the, ifbb, and, ami, took, over, the, promotion, of, the, mr, olympia, contest, in, 2017, ami, took, the, contest, outright, in, the, early, 21st, century, patterns, of, consumption, and, recreation, similar, to, those, of, the, united, states, became, more, widespread, in, europe, and, especially, in, eastern, europe, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, this, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, whole, new, populations, of, bodybuilders, from, former, eastern, bloc, states, in, the, early, 2000s, the, ifbb, was, attempting, to, make, bodybuilding, an, olympic, sport, it, obtained, full, ioc, membership, in, 2000, and, was, attempting, to, get, approved, as, a, demonstration, event, at, the, olympics, which, would, hopefully, lead, to, it, being, added, as, a, full, contest, this, did, not, happen, and, olympic, recognition, for, bodybuilding, remains, controversial, since, many, argue, that, bodybuilding, is, not, a, sport, the, advent, of, social, media, had, a, profound, influence, on, fitness, and, bodybuilding, it, is, common, to, see, platforms, such, as, instagram, tiktok, and, youtube, flooded, with, fitness, related, content, changing, how, the, average, person, views, and, interacts, with, fitness, culture, gym, clothing, brands, like, gymshark, youngla, and, rawgear, leveraged, this, platform, to, create, their, brands, by, recruiting, fitness, ambassadors, real, people, who, embody, their, brand, values, these, companies, personalize, their, marketing, strategy, and, create, a, more, relatable, image, these, ambassadors, often, in, the, form, of, fitness, influencers, or, personal, trainers, promote, the, brand, by, sharing, their, workout, routines, dietary, plans, and, gym, clothing, youtube, in, particular, has, seen, a, surge, in, fitness, content, ranging, from, gym, vlogs, to, detailed, discussions, on, workout, attire, this, not, only, provides, consumers, with, an, abundance, of, free, resources, to, aid, their, fitness, journey, but, also, creates, a, more, informed, consumer, base, another, growing, trend, with, gym, related, social, media, is, the, phenomenon, of, gym, shaming, a, video, posted, by, content, creator, jessica, fernandez, on, twitch, that, went, viral, showed, her, lifting, weights, in, a, gym, while, a, man, in, the, background, stared, at, her, sparking, a, widespread, debate, about, narcissism, and, an, increasingly, toxic, gym, culture, in, the, age, of, social, media, the, video, led, to, criticism, of, an, emerging, trend, in, which, gyms, once, known, as, places, for, focused, workouts, are, now, being, treated, as, filming, locations, for, aspiring, or, established, influencers, with, bystanders, being, unintentionally, placed, under, the, public, eye, in, the, process, bodybuilder, joey, swoll, who, voiced, his, concerns, over, this, culture, addressed, the, controversy, by, stating, that, while, harassment, in, gyms, needs, to, be, addressed, the, man, in, fernandez, s, video, was, not, guilty, of, it, although, social, media, is, giving, more, attention, to, the, world, of, bodybuilding, there, are, still, some, areas, that, are, controversial, in, the, modern, bodybuilding, industry, the, term, professional, generally, means, a, bodybuilder, who, has, won, qualifying, competitions, as, an, amateur, and, has, earned, a, pro, card, from, their, respective, organization, professionals, earn, the, right, to, compete, in, competitions, that, include, monetary, prizes, a, pro, card, also, prohibits, the, athlete, from, competing, in, federations, other, than, the, one, from, which, they, have, received, the, pro, card, depending, on, the, level, of, success, these, bodybuilders, may, receive, monetary, compensation, from, sponsors, much, like, athletes, in, other, sports, due, to, the, growing, concerns, of, the, high, cost, health, consequences, and, illegal, nature, of, some, steroids, many, organizations, have, formed, in, response, and, have, deemed, themselves, natural, bodybuilding, competitions, in, addition, to, the, concerns, noted, many, promoters, of, bodybuilding, have, sought, to, shed, the, freakish, perception, that, the, general, public, has, of, bodybuilding, and, have, successfully, introduced, a, more, mainstream, audience, to, the, sport, of, bodybuilding, by, including, competitors, whose, physiques, appear, much, more, attainable, and, realistic, in, natural, contests, the, testing, protocol, ranges, among, organizations, from, lie, detectors, to, urinalysis, penalties, range, from, organization, to, organization, from, suspensions, to, strict, bans, from, competition, natural, organizations, also, have, their, own, list, of, banned, substances, and, it, is, important, to, refer, to, each, organization, s, website, for, more, information, about, which, substances, are, banned, from, competition, there, are, many, natural, bodybuilding, organizations, some, of, the, larger, ones, include, musclemania, ultimate, fitness, events, ufe, inbf, wnbf, and, inba, pnba, these, organizations, either, have, an, american, or, worldwide, presence, and, are, not, limited, to, the, country, in, which, they, are, headquartered, due, to, those, who, found, open, bodybuilding, to, be, too, big, or, ugly, and, unhealthy, a, new, category, was, started, in, 2013, the, first, men, s, physique, olympia, winner, was, mark, wingson, who, was, followed, by, jeremy, buendia, for, four, consecutive, years, like, open, bodybuilding, the, federations, in, which, bodybuilders, can, compete, are, natural, divisions, as, well, as, normal, ones, the, main, difference, between, the, two, is, that, men, s, physique, competitors, pose, in, board, shorts, rather, than, a, traditional, posing, suit, and, open, bodybuilders, are, much, larger, and, are, more, muscular, than, the, men, s, physique, competitors, open, bodybuilders, have, an, extensive, routine, for, posing, while, the, physique, category, is, primarily, judged, by, the, front, and, back, poses, many, of, the, men, s, physique, competitors, are, not, above, 200, lbs, and, have, a, bit, of, a, more, attainable, and, aesthetic, physique, in, comparison, to, open, bodybuilders, although, this, category, started, off, slowly, it, has, grown, tremendously, and, currently, men, s, physique, seems, to, be, a, more, popular, class, than, open, bodybuilding, this, is, the, middle, ground, of, both, men, s, physique, and, bodybuilding, the, competitors, in, this, category, are, not, nearly, as, big, as, bodybuilders, but, not, as, small, as, men, s, physique, competitors, they, pose, and, perform, in, men, s, boxer, briefs, to, show, off, the, legs, unlike, men, s, physique, which, hide, the, legs, in, board, shorts, classic, physique, started, in, 2016, danny, hester, was, the, first, classic, physique, mr, olympia, as, of, 2023, chris, bumstead, is, the, 5x, reigning, mr, olympia, the, female, movement, of, the, 1960s, combined, with, title, ix, and, the, all, around, fitness, revolution, gave, birth, to, new, alternative, perspectives, of, feminine, beauty, that, included, an, athletic, physique, of, toned, muscle, this, athletic, physique, was, found, in, various, popular, media, outlets, such, as, fashion, magazines, female, bodybuilders, changed, the, limits, of, traditional, femininity, as, their, bodies, showed, that, muscles, are, not, only, just, for, men, the, first, u, s, women, s, national, physique, championship, promoted, by, henry, mcghee, and, held, in, 1978, in, canton, ohio, is, generally, regarded, as, the, first, true, female, bodybuilding, contest, that, is, the, first, contest, where, the, entrants, were, judged, solely, on, muscularity, in, 1980, the, first, ms, olympia, initially, known, as, the, miss, olympia, the, most, prestigious, contest, for, professionals, was, held, the, first, winner, was, rachel, mclish, who, had, also, won, the, npc, s, usa, championship, earlier, in, the, year, the, contest, was, a, major, turning, point, for, female, bodybuilding, in, 1985, the, documentary, pumping, iron, ii, the, women, was, released, it, documented, the, preparation, of, several, women, for, the, 1983, caesars, palace, world, cup, championship, competitors, prominently, featured, in, the, film, were, kris, alexander, lori, bowen, lydia, cheng, carla, dunlap, bev, francis, and, mclish, at, the, time, francis, was, actually, a, powerlifter, though, she, soon, made, a, successful, transition, to, bodybuilding, becoming, one, of, the, leading, competitors, of, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, the, related, areas, of, fitness, and, figure, competition, increased, in, popularity, surpassing, that, of, female, bodybuilding, and, provided, an, alternative, for, women, who, choose, not, to, develop, the, level, of, muscularity, necessary, for, bodybuilding, mclish, would, closely, resemble, what, is, thought, of, today, as, a, fitness, and, figure, competitor, instead, of, what, is, now, considered, a, female, bodybuilder, e, wilma, conner, competed, in, the, 2011, npc, armbrust, pro, gym, warrior, classic, championships, in, loveland, colorado, at, the, age, of, 75, years, and, 349, days, in, competitive, bodybuilding, bodybuilders, aspire, to, present, an, aesthetically, pleasing, body, on, stage, in, prejudging, competitors, do, a, series, of, mandatory, poses, the, front, lat, spread, rear, lat, spread, front, double, biceps, back, double, biceps, side, chest, side, triceps, most, muscular, men, only, abdominals, and, thighs, each, competitor, also, performs, a, personal, choreographed, routine, to, display, their, physique, a, posedown, is, usually, held, at, the, end, of, a, posing, round, while, judges, are, finishing, their, scoring, bodybuilders, are, advised, to, spend, a, lot, of, time, practising, their, posing, in, front, of, mirrors, or, under, the, guidance, of, their, coach, in, contrast, to, strongman, or, powerlifting, competitions, where, physical, strength, is, paramount, or, to, olympic, weightlifting, where, the, main, point, is, equally, split, between, strength, and, technique, bodybuilding, competitions, typically, emphasize, condition, size, and, symmetry, different, organizations, emphasize, particular, aspects, of, competition, and, sometimes, have, different, categories, in, which, to, compete, the, general, strategy, adopted, by, most, present, day, competitive, bodybuilders, is, to, make, muscle, gains, for, most, of, the, year, known, as, the, off, season, and, approximately, 12, 14, weeks, from, competition, lose, a, maximum, of, body, fat, referred, to, as, cutting, while, preserving, as, much, muscular, mass, as, possible, the, bulking, phase, entails, remaining, in, a, net, positive, energy, balance, calorie, surplus, the, amount, of, a, surplus, in, which, a, person, remains, is, based, on, the, person, s, goals, as, a, bigger, surplus, and, longer, bulking, phase, will, create, more, fat, tissue, the, surplus, of, calories, relative, to, one, s, energy, balance, will, ensure, that, muscles, remain, in, a, state, of, anabolism, the, cutting, phase, entails, remaining, in, a, net, negative, energy, balance, calorie, deficit, the, main, goal, of, cutting, is, to, oxidize, fat, while, preserving, as, much, muscle, as, possible, the, larger, the, calorie, deficit, the, faster, one, will, lose, weight, however, a, large, calorie, deficit, will, also, create, the, risk, of, losing, muscle, tissue, the, bulking, and, cutting, strategy, is, considered, effective, because, there, is, a, well, established, link, between, muscle, hypertrophy, and, being, in, a, state, of, positive, energy, balance, a, sustained, period, of, caloric, surplus, will, allow, the, athlete, to, gain, more, fat, free, mass, than, they, could, otherwise, gain, under, eucaloric, conditions, some, gain, in, fat, mass, is, expected, which, athletes, seek, to, oxidize, in, a, cutting, period, while, maintaining, as, much, lean, mass, as, possible, however, it, is, unclear, whether, one, can, maintain, enough, fat, free, mass, during, cutting, for, the, overall, process, to, be, worth, it, the, attempt, to, increase, muscle, mass, in, one, s, body, without, any, gain, in, fat, is, called, clean, bulking, competitive, bodybuilders, focus, their, efforts, to, achieve, a, peak, appearance, during, a, brief, competition, season, clean, bulking, takes, longer, and, is, a, more, refined, approach, to, achieving, the, body, fat, and, muscle, mass, percentage, a, person, is, looking, for, a, common, tactic, for, keeping, fat, low, and, muscle, mass, high, is, to, have, higher, calorie, and, lower, calorie, days, to, maintain, a, balance, between, gain, and, loss, many, clean, bulk, diets, start, off, with, a, moderate, amount, of, carbs, moderate, amount, of, protein, and, a, low, amount, of, fats, to, maintain, a, clean, bulk, it, is, important, to, reach, calorie, goals, every, day, macronutrient, goals, carbs, fats, and, proteins, will, be, different, for, each, person, but, it, is, ideal, to, get, as, close, as, possible, dirty, bulking, is, the, process, of, eating, at, a, massive, caloric, surplus, without, trying, to, figure, out, the, exact, amount, of, ingested, macronutrients, often, down, with, junk, food, such, as, burgers, and, fries, weightlifters, who, attempt, to, gain, mass, quickly, with, no, aesthetic, concerns, often, choose, to, do, this, bodybuilders, use, three, main, strategies, to, maximize, muscle, hypertrophy, intensive, weight, training, causes, micro, tears, to, the, muscles, being, trained, this, is, generally, known, as, microtrauma, these, micro, tears, in, the, muscle, contribute, to, the, soreness, felt, after, exercise, called, delayed, onset, muscle, soreness, doms, it, is, the, repair, of, these, micro, traumas, that, results, in, muscle, growth, normally, this, soreness, becomes, most, apparent, a, day, or, two, after, a, workout, however, as, muscles, become, adapted, to, the, exercises, soreness, tends, to, decrease, weight, training, aims, to, build, muscle, by, prompting, two, different, types, of, hypertrophy, sarcoplasmic, and, myofibrillar, sarcoplasmic, hypertrophy, leads, to, larger, muscles, and, so, is, favored, by, bodybuilders, more, than, myofibrillar, hypertrophy, which, builds, athletic, strength, sarcoplasmic, hypertrophy, is, triggered, by, increasing, repetitions, whereas, myofibrillar, hypertrophy, is, triggered, by, lifting, heavier, weight, in, either, case, there, is, an, increase, in, both, size, and, strength, of, the, muscles, compared, to, what, happens, if, that, same, individual, does, not, lift, weights, at, all, although, the, emphasis, is, different, the, high, levels, of, muscle, growth, and, repair, achieved, by, bodybuilders, require, a, specialized, diet, generally, speaking, bodybuilders, require, more, calories, than, the, average, person, of, the, same, weight, to, provide, the, protein, and, energy, requirements, needed, to, support, their, training, and, increase, muscle, mass, in, preparation, of, a, contest, a, sub, maintenance, level, of, food, energy, is, combined, with, cardiovascular, exercise, to, lose, body, fat, proteins, carbohydrates, and, fats, are, the, three, major, macronutrients, that, the, human, body, needs, to, build, muscle, the, ratios, of, calories, from, carbohydrates, proteins, and, fats, vary, depending, on, the, goals, of, the, bodybuilder, carbohydrates, play, an, important, role, for, bodybuilders, they, give, the, body, energy, to, deal, with, the, rigors, of, training, and, recovery, carbohydrates, also, promote, secretion, of, insulin, a, hormone, enabling, cells, to, get, the, glucose, they, need, insulin, also, carries, amino, acids, into, cells, and, promotes, protein, synthesis, insulin, has, steroid, like, effects, in, terms, of, muscle, gains, it, is, impossible, to, promote, protein, synthesis, without, the, existence, of, insulin, which, means, that, without, ingesting, carbohydrates, or, protein, which, also, induces, the, release, of, insulin, it, is, impossible, to, add, muscle, mass, bodybuilders, seek, out, low, glycemic, polysaccharides, and, other, slowly, digesting, carbohydrates, which, release, energy, in, a, more, stable, fashion, than, high, glycemic, sugars, and, starches, this, is, important, as, high, glycemic, carbohydrates, cause, a, sharp, insulin, response, which, places, the, body, in, a, state, where, it, is, likely, to, store, additional, food, energy, as, fat, however, bodybuilders, frequently, do, ingest, some, quickly, digesting, sugars, often, in, form, of, pure, dextrose, or, maltodextrin, just, before, during, and, or, just, after, a, workout, this, may, help, to, replenish, glycogen, stored, within, the, muscle, and, to, stimulate, muscle, protein, synthesis, the, motor, proteins, actin, and, myosin, generate, the, forces, exerted, by, contracting, muscles, cortisol, decreases, amino, acid, uptake, by, muscle, and, inhibits, protein, synthesis, current, recommendations, suggest, that, bodybuilders, should, consume, 25, 30, of, protein, per, total, calorie, intake, to, further, their, goal, of, maintaining, and, improving, their, body, composition, this, is, a, widely, debated, topic, with, many, arguing, that, 1, gram, of, protein, per, pound, of, body, weight, per, day, is, ideal, some, suggesting, that, less, is, sufficient, while, others, recommending, 1, 5, 2, or, more, it, is, believed, that, protein, needs, to, be, consumed, frequently, throughout, the, day, especially, during, after, a, workout, and, before, sleep, there, is, also, some, debate, concerning, the, best, type, of, protein, to, take, chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs, and, dairy, foods, are, high, in, protein, as, are, some, nuts, seeds, beans, and, lentils, casein, or, whey, are, often, used, to, supplement, the, diet, with, additional, protein, whey, is, the, type, of, protein, contained, in, many, popular, brands, of, protein, supplements, and, is, preferred, by, many, bodybuilders, because, of, its, high, biological, value, bv, and, quick, absorption, rates, whey, protein, also, has, a, bigger, effect, than, casein, on, insulin, levels, triggering, about, double, the, amount, of, insulin, release, that, effect, is, somewhat, overcome, by, combining, casein, and, whey, bodybuilders, were, previously, thought, to, require, protein, with, a, higher, bv, than, that, of, soy, which, was, additionally, avoided, due, to, its, alleged, estrogenic, female, hormone, properties, though, more, recent, studies, have, shown, that, soy, actually, contains, phytoestrogens, which, compete, with, estrogens, in, the, male, body, and, can, block, estrogenic, actions, soy, flax, and, other, plant, based, foods, that, contain, phytoestrogens, are, also, beneficial, because, they, can, inhibit, some, pituitary, functions, while, stimulating, the, liver, s, p450, system, which, eliminates, hormones, drugs, and, waste, from, the, body, to, more, actively, process, and, excrete, excess, estrogen, some, bodybuilders, often, split, their, food, intake, into, 5, to, 7, meals, of, equal, nutritional, content, and, eat, at, regular, intervals, e, g, every, 2, to, 3, hours, this, approach, serves, two, purposes, to, limit, overindulging, in, the, cutting, phase, and, to, allow, for, the, consumption, of, large, volumes, of, food, during, the, bulking, phase, eating, more, frequently, does, not, increase, basal, metabolic, rate, when, compared, to, 3, meals, a, day, while, food, does, have, a, metabolic, cost, to, digest, absorb, and, store, called, the, thermic, effect, of, food, it, depends, on, the, quantity, and, type, of, food, not, how, the, food, is, spread, across, the, meals, of, the, day, well, controlled, studies, using, whole, body, calorimetry, and, doubly, labeled, water, have, demonstrated, that, there, is, no, metabolic, advantage, to, eating, more, frequently, the, important, role, of, nutrition, in, building, muscle, and, losing, fat, means, bodybuilders, may, consume, a, wide, variety, of, dietary, supplements, various, products, are, used, in, an, attempt, to, augment, muscle, size, increase, the, rate, of, fat, loss, improve, joint, health, increase, natural, testosterone, production, enhance, training, performance, and, prevent, potential, nutrient, deficiencies, some, bodybuilders, use, drugs, such, as, anabolic, steroids, and, precursor, substances, such, as, prohormones, to, increase, muscle, hypertrophy, anabolic, steroids, cause, hypertrophy, of, both, types, i, and, ii, of, muscle, fibers, likely, caused, by, an, increased, synthesis, of, muscle, proteins, they, also, provoke, undesired, side, effects, including, hepatotoxicity, gynecomastia, acne, the, early, onset, of, male, pattern, baldness, and, a, decline, in, the, body, s, own, testosterone, production, which, can, cause, testicular, atrophy, other, performance, enhancing, substances, used, by, competitive, bodybuilders, include, human, growth, hormone, hgh, hgh, is, also, used, by, female, bodybuilders, to, obtain, bigger, muscles, while, maintaining, a, female, appearance, muscle, growth, is, more, difficult, to, achieve, in, older, adults, than, younger, adults, because, of, biological, aging, which, leads, to, many, metabolic, changes, detrimental, to, muscle, growth, for, instance, by, diminishing, growth, hormone, and, testosterone, levels, some, recent, clinical, studies, have, shown, that, low, dose, hgh, treatment, for, adults, with, hgh, deficiency, changes, the, body, composition, by, increasing, muscle, mass, decreasing, fat, mass, increasing, bone, density, and, muscle, strength, improves, cardiovascular, parameters, and, affects, the, quality, of, life, without, significant, side, effects, in, rodents, knockdown, of, metallothionein, gene, expression, results, in, activation, of, the, akt, pathway, and, increases, in, myotube, size, in, type, iib, fiber, hypertrophy, and, ultimately, in, muscle, strength, some, bodybuilders, inject, oils, or, other, compounds, into, their, muscles, sometimes, known, as, synthol, to, enhance, their, size, or, appearance, this, practice, can, have, serious, health, consequences, although, muscle, stimulation, occurs, when, lifting, weights, muscle, growth, occurs, during, rest, periods, for, up, to, 48, hours, after, the, workout, some, bodybuilders, add, a, massage, at, the, end, of, each, workout, to, their, routine, as, a, method, of, recovering, overtraining, occurs, when, a, bodybuilder, has, trained, to, the, point, where, their, workload, exceeds, their, recovery, capacity, there, are, many, reasons, why, overtraining, occurs, including, lack, of, adequate, nutrition, lack, of, recovery, time, between, workouts, insufficient, sleep, and, training, at, a, high, intensity, for, too, long, a, lack, of, splitting, apart, workouts, training, at, a, high, intensity, too, frequently, also, stimulates, the, central, nervous, system, cns, and, can, result, in, a, hyperadrenergic, state, that, interferes, with, sleep, patterns, to, avoid, overtraining, intense, frequent, training, must, be, met, with, at, least, an, equal, amount, of, purposeful, recovery, timely, provision, of, carbohydrates, proteins, and, various, micronutrients, such, as, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, even, nutritional, supplements, are, critical, a, mental, disorder, informally, called, bigorexia, by, analogy, with, anorexia, may, account, for, overtraining, in, some, individuals, sufferers, feel, as, if, they, are, never, big, enough, or, muscular, enough, which, forces, them, to, overtrain, to, try, to, reach, their, goal, physique, an, article, by, muscle, fitness, magazine, overtrain, for, big, gains, claimed, that, overtraining, for, a, brief, period, can, be, beneficial, overtraining, can, be, used, advantageously, as, when, a, bodybuilder, is, purposely, overtrained, for, a, brief, period, of, time, to, super, compensate, during, a, regeneration, phase, these, are, known, as, shock, micro, cycles, and, were, a, key, training, technique, used, by, soviet, athletes
