prerequisite, of, recreation, leisure, has, increased, with, increased, longevity, and, for, many, with, decreased, hours, spent, for, physical, and, economic, survival, yet, others, argue, that,

population, trends, and, increased, commercialization, of, recreational, offerings, while, one, perception, is, that, leisure, is, just, spare, time, time, not, consumed, by, the, necessities, of, living, another, holds, that, leisure, is, a, force, that, allows, individuals, to, consider, and, reflect, on, the, values, and, realities, that, are, missed, in, the, activities, of, daily, life,
