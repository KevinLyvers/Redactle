winter, sport, after, ice, hockey, but, it, is, not, recorded, how, many, of, these, participants, are, male, and, how, many, are, female, the, earliest, origin, of, the, sport, is, debated, though, many, russians, see, their, old, countrymen, as, the, creators, of, the, sport, reflected, by, the, unofficial, title, for, bandy, russian, hockey, russia, england, wales, and, the, netherlands, each, had, sports, or, pastimes, such, as, bando, which, can, be, seen, as, forerunners, of, the, present, sport, the, mid, eighteenth, century, devonshire, dialogue, collection, lists, bandy, as, a, game, like, that, of, golf, in, which, the, adverse, parties, endeavour, to, beat, a, ball, generally, a, knob, or, gnarl, from, the, trunk, of, a, tree, opposite, ways, the, stick, with, which, the, game,

in, britain, english, bandy, developed, as, a, winter, sport, in, the, fens, of, east, anglia, large, expanses, of, ice, would, form, on, the, flooded, meadows, or, shallow, washes, in, cold, winters, where, fen, skating, which, has, been, a, tradition, dating, back, to, at, least, medieval, times, took, place, bandy, s, early, recorded, modernization, period, can, be, traced, back, to, 1813, members, of, the, bury, fen, bandy, club, published, rules, of, the, game, in, 1882, and, introduced, it, into, other, european, countries, a, variety, of, stick, and, ball, games, involving, ice, skating, were, introduced, to, north, america, by, the, 1800s, but, failed, to, organize, and, develop, popular, rules, codes, however, these, stick, and, ball, games, became, one, of, the, eventual, antecedents, of, the, modern, sport, of, ice, hockey, whose, first, rules, were, codified, in, canada, in, 1875, almost, a, decade, before, the, rules, of, modern, bandy, were, established, in, britain, the, first, international, bandy, match, took, place, in, 1891, between, bury, fen, and, the, haarlemsche, hockey, bandy, club, from, the, netherlands, a, club, which, after, a, couple, of, club, fusions, now, is, named, hc, bloemendaal, the, same, year, the, national, bandy, association, was, established, in, england, as, a, governing, body, for, the, sport, in, england, national, governing, federations, for, bandy, were, also, founded, in, the, 1890s, in, the, netherlands, and, russia, and, in, the, following, decade, in, finland, sweden, and, norway, the, match, later, dubbed, the, original, bandy, match, was, actually, held, in, 1875, at, the, crystal, palace, in, london, however, at, the, time, the, game, was, called, hockey, on, the, ice, probably, as, it, was, considered, an, ice, variant, of, field, hockey, an, early, maker, of, bandy, sticks, was, the, firm, of, gray, s, cambridge, one, such, stick, now, in, the, collections, of, the, museum, of, cambridge, has, a, length, of, rope, twisted, round, the, handle, to, rescue, any, player, who, might, fall, through, the, ice, as, the, game, was, played, on, frozen, lakes, back, then, an, 1899, photo, of, two, players, demonstrating, the, game, shows, the, sticks, being, held, single, handed, historically, bandy, was, a, popular, sport, in, england, and, in, some, central, and, western, european, countries, until, the, first, world, war, and, from, 1901, to, 1926, it, was, played, in, the, scandinavian, nordic, games, the, first, international, multi, sport, event, focused, on, winter, sports, the, sport, s, english, name, comes, from, the, verb, to, bandy, from, the, middle, french, bander, to, strike, back, and, forth, and, originally, referred, to, a, seventeenth, century, irish, game, similar, to, field, hockey, the, curved, stick, was, also, called, a, bandy, the, etymological, connection, to, the, similarly, named, welsh, hockey, game, of, bando, is, not, clear, an, old, name, for, bandy, is, hockey, on, the, ice, in, the, first, rule, books, from, england, at, the, turn, of, the, century, 1900, the, sport, is, literally, called, bandy, or, hockey, on, the, ice, since, the, early, twentieth, century, the, term, bandy, is, usually, preferred, to, prevent, confusion, with, ice, hockey, the, sport, is, known, as, bandy, in, many, languages, with, a, few, exceptions, in, russia, bandy, is, called, russian, hockey, or, more, frequently, and, officially, hockey, with, a, ball, while, ice, hockey, is, called, hockey, with, a, puck, or, more, frequently, just, hockey, if, the, context, makes, it, clear, that, bandy, is, the, subject, it, as, well, can, be, called, just, hockey, in, belarusian, ukrainian, and, bulgarian, it, is, also, called, hockey, with, a, ball, o, and, respectively, in, slovak, bandy, hockey, bandyhokej, is, the, name, in, armenian, kazakh, kyrgyz, mongol, and, uzbek, bandy, is, known, as, ball, hockey, and, koptokli, xokkey, respectively, in, finnish, the, two, sports, are, distinguished, as, ice, ball, j, pallo, and, ice, puck, j, kiekko, as, well, as, in, hungarian, j, glabda, j, gkorong, although, in, hungarian, it, is, more, often, called, bandy, nowadays, in, estonian, bandy, is, also, called, ice, ball, j, pall, in, mandarin, chinese, it, is, bandy, ball, in, scottish, gaelic, the, name, is, ice, shinty, camanachd, deighe, in, old, times, shinty, or, shinney, were, also, sometimes, used, in, english, for, bandy, because, of, its, similarities, with, association, football, bandy, is, also, nicknamed, winter, football, swedish, vinterns, fotboll, with, association, football, and, hockey, on, ice, or, bandy, both, being, popular, sports, in, parts, of, europe, around, 1900, bandy, was, highly, influenced, by, football, and, taking, after, its, main, rules, having, a, field, approximately, the, same, size, having, the, same, number, of, players, on, each, team, and, having, the, same, game, time, 2, 45, minutes, it, is, natural, that, bandy, got, the, nickname, winter, football, it, was, common, for, sports, clubs, to, have, both, a, bandy, and, a, football, section, with, athletes, playing, both, sports, but, at, different, times, of, the, year, some, examples, are, nottingham, forest, football, and, bandy, club, in, england, today, known, just, as, nottingham, forest, f, c, and, norwegian, str, msgodset, if, and, mj, ndalen, if, with, both, having, an, active, bandy, section, in, sweden, most, football, clubs, that, were, active, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, also, played, bandy, swedish, player, orvar, bergmark, earned, silver, medals, in, the, world, championships, of, both, sports, in, the, 1950s, later, as, the, season, for, each, sport, increased, in, time, it, was, not, as, easy, for, the, players, to, engage, in, both, sports, so, some, clubs, came, to, concentrate, on, one, or, the, other, many, old, clubs, still, have, both, sports, on, their, program, sten, ove, ramberg, is, the, last, swedish, player, in, both, national, teams, 1978, in, bandy, 1979, 1984, in, football, no, clear, distinction, between, bandy, and, ice, hockey, was, made, before, the, 1920s, as, bandy, in, a, way, can, be, seen, as, a, precursor, to, ice, hockey, bandy, has, influenced, the, development, and, history, of, ice, hockey, mainly, in, european, and, former, soviet, countries, while, modern, ice, hockey, was, created, in, canada, a, variety, of, games, which, bore, a, closer, resemblance, to, bandy, were, initially, played, there, after, british, soldiers, introduced, the, game, of, bandy, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, at, the, same, time, as, modern, ice, hockey, rules, were, formalized, in, british, north, america, present, day, canada, bandy, rules, were, decided, upon, in, europe, a, cross, between, english, and, russian, bandy, rules, eventually, developed, with, the, football, inspired, english, rules, cf, the, passage, above, about, bandy, and, association, football, becoming, dominant, together, with, the, russian, low, border, along, most, of, the, two, sidelines, an, addition, to, the, sport, which, has, maintained, its, presence, since, the, 1950s, before, canadians, introduced, ice, hockey, into, europe, in, the, early, twentieth, century, hockey, was, another, name, for, bandy, and, still, is, in, parts, of, russia, and, kazakhstan, both, bandy, and, ice, hockey, were, played, in, europe, during, the, twentieth, century, especially, in, sweden, finland, and, norway, ice, hockey, became, more, popular, than, bandy, in, most, of, europe, mostly, because, it, had, become, an, olympic, sport, while, bandy, had, not, athletes, in, europe, who, had, played, bandy, switched, to, ice, hockey, in, the, 1920s, to, compete, in, the, olympics, the, smaller, ice, fields, needed, for, ice, hockey, also, made, its, rinks, easier, to, maintain, especially, in, countries, with, short, winters, on, the, other, hand, ice, hockey, was, not, played, in, the, soviet, union, until, the, 1950s, when, the, ussr, wanted, to, compete, internationally, the, typical, european, style, of, ice, hockey, with, flowing, less, physical, play, represents, a, heritage, of, bandy, the, first, national, bandy, league, in, modern, history, was, started, in, sweden, in, 1902, bandy, was, played, at, the, nordic, games, in, both, stockholm, and, kristiania, present, day, oslo, in, 1901, 1903, 1905, 1909, 1913, 1917, 1922, and, 1926, and, between, swedish, finnish, and, russian, teams, at, similar, games, in, helsinki, in, 1907, bandy, appeared, as, a, sport, in, all, eight, editions, of, the, nordic, games, from, 1901, to, 1926, some, sources, describe, a, 1913, european, bandy, championships, as, having, been, held, in, february, 1913, in, st, moritz, switzerland, at, the, same, time, as, the, bandy, tournament, at, the, 1913, nordic, games, however, this, european, championship, tournament, likely, never, happened, or, is, a, conflation, of, titles, since, no, contemporary, sources, have, been, found, still, in, 2014, a, four, nation, bandy, tournament, was, held, in, davos, switzerland, as, a, centenary, celebration, of, the, alleged, 1913, european, bandy, championships, the, highest, altitude, where, bandy, has, been, played, is, in, khorugh, the, capital, of, the, tajik, autonomous, province, of, gorno, badakhshan, khorugh, is, situated, 2, 200, metres, 7, 200, feet, above, sea, level, in, the, pamir, mountains, since, the, 1950s, when, the, soviet, union, ended, its, isolation, and, started, to, take, part, in, international, sports, events, there, has, been, a, reason, to, play, world, championships, the, international, bandy, federation, was, founded, in, 1955, and, the, first, world, championships, were, played, in, 1957, with, the, soviet, union, and, then, russia, as, its, successor, country, in, 1993, almost, consistently, in, a, top, position, in, the, sport, of, bandy, alongside, sweden, finland, has, won, once, in, 2004, in, a, similar, fashion, russia, along, with, sweden, has, emerged, as, one, of, the, two, dominant, women, s, bandy, nations, internationally, in, the, women, s, bandy, world, championship, women, s, bandy, uses, the, exact, same, rules, as, men, but, the, women, s, game, is, played, separately, women, have, been, playing, bandy, since, the, sport, was, originally, developed, although, there, were, several, attempts, in, the, early, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, to, organise, bandy, leagues, for, women, s, teams, regular, leagues, only, started, in, the, 1970s, in, sweden, and, finland, and, then, later, in, the, 1980s, in, norway, and, the, soviet, union, starting, in, the, 1980s, and, increasingly, since, the, turn, of, the, millennium, more, and, more, indoor, arenas, for, bandy, have, been, built, often, as, joint, arenas, to, be, used, also, for, football, or, speed, skating, the, use, of, indoor, arenas, makes, the, effects, of, the, weather, on, a, game, virtually, insignificant, something, which, earlier, always, have, been, a, factor, to, consider, for, the, teams, and, the, audiences, however, unlike, some, other, sports, bandy, is, still, the, same, game, with, the, same, rules, indoors, or, outdoors, and, no, changes, are, made, to, the, rules, depending, on, whether, there, s, a, roof, overhead, or, not, many, games, even, in, the, highest, leagues, are, still, played, outdoors, in, sweden, there, are, more, indoor, arenas, than, in, all, other, countries, combined, bandy, is, played, on, ice, using, a, single, round, bandy, ball, two, teams, of, 11, players, each, compete, to, get, the, ball, into, the, other, team, s, goal, using, bandy, sticks, thereby, scoring, a, goal, the, team, that, has, scored, more, goals, at, the, end, of, the, game, is, the, winner, if, both, teams, have, scored, an, equal, number, of, goals, then, with, some, exceptions, the, game, is, a, draw, the, game, is, designed, to, be, played, on, a, rectangular, sheet, of, ice, called, a, bandy, field, which, is, the, same, size, as, a, football, soccer, field, in, a, typical, game, players, attempt, to, propel, the, ball, toward, their, opponents, goal, through, individual, control, of, the, ball, such, as, by, dribbling, passing, the, ball, to, a, teammate, and, taking, shots, at, the, goal, which, is, guarded, by, the, opposing, goalkeeper, opposing, players, may, try, to, regain, control, of, the, ball, by, intercepting, a, pass, or, tackling, the, opponent, who, controls, the, ball, however, physical, contact, between, opponents, is, limited, bandy, is, generally, a, free, flowing, game, with, play, stopping, only, when, the, ball, has, left, the, field, of, play, or, when, play, is, stopped, by, the, referee, after, a, stoppage, play, can, recommence, with, a, free, stroke, a, penalty, shot, or, a, corner, stroke, if, the, ball, has, left, the, field, along, the, sidelines, the, referee, must, decide, which, team, touched, the, ball, last, and, award, a, restart, stroke, to, the, opposing, team, just, like, football, s, throw, in, in, terms, of, rules, bandy, has, several, rules, that, are, similar, to, football, each, team, has, 11, players, one, of, whom, is, a, goalkeeper, goalkeepers, use, gloves, made, specifically, for, their, position, and, wear, them, on, both, hands, but, do, not, use, any, type, of, stick, the, offside, rule, which, in, general, is, similar, to, the, one, used, in, football, is, also, employed, a, goal, cannot, be, scored, from, a, goal, throw, but, unlike, football, a, goal, can, be, scored, from, a, stroke, in, or, a, corner, stroke, all, free, strokes, are, direct, and, allow, a, goal, to, be, scored, without, another, player, touching, the, ball, a, primary, rule, is, that, players, other, than, the, goalkeepers, may, not, intentionally, touch, the, ball, with, their, heads, hands, or, arms, during, play, although, players, usually, use, their, sticks, to, move, the, ball, around, they, may, use, any, part, of, their, bodies, other, than, their, heads, hands, or, arms, and, may, use, their, skates, in, a, limited, manner, the, rules, do, not, specify, any, player, positions, other, than, goalkeeper, but, a, number, of, player, specialisations, have, evolved, broadly, these, include, three, main, categories, players, in, these, positions, are, referred, to, as, outfield, players, to, discern, them, from, the, single, goalkeeper, these, positions, are, further, differentiated, by, which, side, of, the, field, the, player, spends, most, time, in, for, example, there, are, central, defenders, and, left, and, right, midfielders, the, ten, outfield, players, may, be, arranged, in, these, positions, in, any, combination, for, example, there, may, be, three, defenders, five, midfielders, and, two, forwards, and, the, number, of, players, in, each, position, determines, the, style, of, the, team, s, play, more, forwards, and, fewer, defenders, would, create, a, more, aggressive, and, offensive, minded, game, while, the, reverse, would, create, a, slower, more, defensive, style, of, play, while, players, may, spend, most, of, the, game, in, a, specific, position, there, are, few, restrictions, on, player, movement, and, players, can, switch, positions, at, any, time, the, layout, of, the, players, on, the, pitch, is, called, the, team, s, formation, and, defining, the, team, s, formation, and, tactics, is, usually, the, prerogative, of, the, team, s, manager, s, formation, in, bandy, is, often, comparable, to, the, formation, in, association, football, shouldering, is, allowed, in, checking, situations, and, body, contact, therefore, does, occur, but, body, checking, and, fighting, are, illegal, bandy, is, a, swift, game, elite, players, have, a, mean, skating, velocity, of, over, 16, km, h, and, the, skating, velocity, can, in, some, cases, reach, 37, km, h, there, are, eighteen, rules, in, official, play, designed, to, apply, to, all, levels, of, bandy, although, certain, modifications, for, groups, such, as, juniors, veterans, or, women, are, permitted, the, rules, are, often, framed, in, broad, terms, which, allow, flexibility, in, their, application, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, game, a, game, is, officiated, by, a, referee, the, authority, and, enforcer, of, the, rules, whose, decisions, are, final, the, referee, may, have, one, or, two, assistant, referees, a, secretary, outside, of, the, field, often, takes, care, of, the, match, protocol, the, bandy, playing, rules, can, be, found, on, the, official, website, of, the, federation, of, international, bandy, and, are, overseen, by, the, rules, and, referee, committee, each, team, consists, of, a, maximum, of, 11, players, excluding, substitutes, one, of, whom, must, be, the, goalkeeper, a, team, of, fewer, than, eight, players, may, not, start, a, game, goalkeepers, are, the, only, players, allowed, to, play, the, ball, with, their, hands, or, arms, and, they, are, only, allowed, to, do, so, within, the, penalty, area, in, front, of, their, own, goal, though, there, are, a, variety, of, positions, in, which, the, outfield, non, goalkeeper, players, are, strategically, placed, by, a, coach, these, positions, are, not, defined, or, required, by, the, rules, of, the, game, the, positions, and, formations, of, the, players, in, bandy, are, virtually, the, same, as, the, common, association, football, positions, and, the, same, terms, are, used, for, the, different, positions, of, the, players, a, team, usually, consists, of, defenders, midfielders, and, forwards, the, defenders, can, play, in, the, form, of, centre, backs, full, backs, and, sometimes, wing, backs, midfielders, playing, in, the, centre, attacking, or, defensive, and, forwards, in, the, form, of, centre, forward, second, strikers, and, sometimes, a, winger, sometimes, one, player, is, also, taking, up, the, role, of, a, libero, any, number, of, players, may, be, replaced, by, substitutes, during, the, course, of, the, game, substitutions, can, be, performed, without, notifying, the, referee, and, can, be, performed, while, the, ball, is, in, play, however, the, substitute, must, leave, the, ice, before, the, teammate, enters, it, a, team, can, bring, at, the, most, four, substitutes, to, the, game, five, if, one, of, these, is, an, extra, goalkeeper, formation, in, bandy, describes, how, the, players, in, a, team, generally, position, themselves, on, the, rink, and, is, often, comparable, to, the, formation, in, association, football, the, team, s, manager, s, define, the, team, s, formation, while, tactics, are, usually, their, prerogative, as, well, bandy, is, a, fluid, and, fast, moving, game, and, with, the, exception, of, the, goalkeeper, a, player, s, position, in, a, formation, defines, their, role, less, rigidly, than, for, instance, for, a, rugby, player, nor, are, there, episodes, in, play, where, players, must, expressly, line, up, in, formation, as, in, gridiron, football, the, bandy, games, are, more, similar, to, association, football, in, this, regard, nevertheless, a, player, s, position, in, a, formation, generally, defines, whether, a, player, has, a, mostly, defensive, or, attacking, role, and, whether, they, tend, to, play, towards, one, side, of, the, pitch, or, centrally, a, standard, adult, bandy, match, consists, of, two, periods, of, 45, minutes, each, known, as, halves, each, half, runs, continuously, meaning, the, clock, is, not, stopped, when, the, ball, is, out, of, play, the, referee, can, however, make, allowance, for, time, lost, through, significant, stoppages, as, described, below, there, is, usually, a, 15, minute, half, time, break, the, end, of, the, match, is, known, as, full, time, the, referee, is, the, official, timekeeper, for, the, match, and, may, make, an, allowance, for, time, lost, through, substitutions, injured, players, requiring, attention, or, other, stoppages, this, added, time, is, commonly, referred, to, as, stoppage, time, or, injury, time, and, must, be, reported, to, the, match, secretary, and, the, two, captains, the, referee, alone, signals, the, end, of, the, match, if, it, is, very, cold, or, if, it, is, snowing, the, match, can, be, broken, into, thirds, of, 30, minutes, each, at, the, extremely, cold, 1999, world, championship, some, matches, were, played, in, four, periods, of, 15, minutes, each, and, with, extra, long, breaks, in, between, in, the, world, championships, the, two, halves, can, be, 30, minutes, each, for, the, nations, in, the,

approved, it, as, a, so, called, recognized, sport, the, abbreviation, ibf, was, at, the, time, already, used, by, another, recognized, sports, federation, and, ioc, considers, it, important, that, the, official, abbreviations, of, sports, federations, are, unique, so, that, the, federations, are, not, mistaken, for, one, another, in, 2004, fib, was, fully, accepted, by, ioc, fib, is, now, a,

every, two, years, starting, in, 1961, and, every, year, since, 2003, currently, the, record, number, of, countries, participating, in, the, world, championships, is, twenty, 2019, since, the, number, of, countries, playing, bandy, is, not, large, every, country, which, can, set, up, a, team, is, welcome, to, take, part, in, the, world, championship, the, quality, of, the, teams, varies, however, with, only, six, nations, sweden, the, soviet, union, russia, finland, norway, and, kazakhstan, having, won, medals, allowing, for, the, fact, that, russia, s, team, took, over, from, the, soviet,

the, country, and, became, a, largely, middle, class, sport, the, games, could, attract, huge, crowds, of, spectators, in, those, days, after, slottsbrons, if, won, the, swedish, championship, in, 1934, it, became, popular, amongst, workers, in, many, smaller, industrial, towns, and, villages, where, there, was, a, bandy, club, the, local, factory, corporation, also, usually, sponsored, the, club, to, mutual, benefit, as, a, successful, team, led, to, good, pr, for, the, company, bandy, remains, the, main, sport, in, many, of, these, places, bandy, in, sweden, is, famous, for, its, culture, where, both, playing, bandy, and, being, a, spectator, requires, great, fortitude, and, dedication, a, bandy, briefcase, is, the, classic, accessory, for, spectating, and, is, typically, made, of, brown, leather, well, worn, and, contains, a, warm, drink, in, a, thermos, and, or, a, bottle, of, liquor, bandy, is, most, often, played, at, outdoor, arenas, during, winter, time, so, the, need, for, spectators, to, carry, flasks, or, thermoses, of, warming, liquid, like, gl, gg, is, a, natural, effect, with, the, sport, moving, indoors, in, recent, decades, and, the, arenas, urging, for, non, alcoholic, policies, for, the, audiences, this, tradition, has, partly, changed, though, not, without, opposition, a, notable, tradition, is, annandagsbandy, bandy, games, played, on, saint,

drawing, crowds, in, excess, of, 20, 000, one, reason, the, play, off, match, was, set, in, uppsala, is, because, of, ifk, uppsala, s, success, at, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, ifk, uppsala, won, 11, titles, in, the, swedish, championships, between, 1907, and, 1920, which, made, them, the, most, successful, bandy, club, in, the, entire, country, now, however, the, record, is, held, by, v, ster, s, sk, a, contributing, factor, was, also, the, poor, quality, of, the, ice, at, s, derstadion, where, the, finals, were, held, from, 1967, to, 1989, in, 2013, and, 2014, the, final, was, played, indoors, in, friends, arena, the, national, stadium, for, football, in, solna, stockholm, with, a, retractable, roof, and, a, capacity, of, 50, 000, the, first, final, at, friends,
