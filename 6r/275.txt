a, maze, is, a, path, or, collection, of, paths, typically, from, an, entrance, to, a, goal, the, word, is, used, to, refer, both, to, branching, tour, puzzles, through, which, the, solver, must, find, a, route, and, to, simpler, non, branching, unicursal, patterns, that, lead, unambiguously, through, a, convoluted, layout, to, a, goal, the, term, labyrinth, is, generally, synonymous, with, maze, but, can, also, connote, specifically, a, unicursal, pattern, the, pathways, and, walls, in, a, maze, are, typically, fixed, but, puzzles, in, which, the, walls, and, paths, can, change, during, the, game, are, also, categorised, as, mazes, or, tour, puzzles, mazes, have, been, built, with, walls, and, rooms, with, hedges, turf, corn, stalks, straw, bales, books, paving, stones, of, contrasting, colors, or, designs, and, brick, or, in, fields, of, crops, such, as, corn, or, indeed, maize, maize, mazes, can, be, very, large, they, are, usually, only, kept, for, one, growing, season, so, they, can, be, different, every, year, and, are, promoted, as, seasonal, tourist, attractions, indoors, mirror, mazes, are, another, form, of, maze, in, which, many, of, the, apparent, pathways, are, imaginary, routes, seen, through, multiple, reflections, in, mirrors, another, type, of, maze, consists, of, a, set, of, rooms, linked, by, doors, so, a, passageway, is, just, another, room, in, this, definition, players, enter, at, one, spot, and, exit, at, another, or, the, idea, may, be, to, reach, a, certain, spot, in, the, maze, mazes, can, also, be, printed, or, drawn, on, paper, to, be, followed, by, a, pencil, or, fingertip, mazes, can, also, be, built, with, snow, maze, generation, is, the, act, of, designing, the, layout, of, passages, and, walls, within, a, maze, there, are, many, different, approaches, to, generating, mazes, with, various, maze, generation, algorithms, for, building, them, either, by, hand, or, automatically, by, computer, there, are, two, main, mechanisms, used, to, generate, mazes, in, carving, passages, one, marks, out, the, network, of, available, routes, in, building, a, maze, by, adding, walls, one, lays, out, a, set, of, obstructions, within, an, open, area, maze, solving, is, the, act, of, finding, a, route, through, the, maze, from, the, start, to, finish, some, maze, solving, methods, are, designed, to, be, used, inside, the, maze, by, a, traveler, with, no, prior, knowledge, of, the, maze, whereas, others, are, designed, to, be, used, by, a, person, or, computer, program, that, can, see, the, whole, maze, at, once, the, mathematician, leonhard, euler, was, one, of, the, first, to, analyze, plane, mazes, mathematically, and, in, doing, so, made, the, first, significant, contributions, to, the, branch, of, mathematics, known, as, topology, mazes, containing, no, loops, are, known, as, standard, or, perfect, mazes, and, are, equivalent, to, a, tree, in, graph, theory, thus, many, maze, solving, algorithms, are, closely, related, to, graph, theory, intuitively, if, one, pulled, and, stretched, out, the, paths, in, the, maze, in, the, proper, way, the, result, could, be, made, to, resemble, a, tree, mazes, are, often, used, in, psychology, experiments, to, study, spatial, navigation, and, learning, such, experiments, typically, use, rats, or, mice, examples, are, india, chartwell, castle, in, johannesburg, claims, to, have, the, biggest, known, uninterrupted, hedgerow, maze, in, the, southern, world, with, over, 900, conifers, it, covers, about, 6000, sq, m, approximately, 1, 5, acres, which, is, around, 5, times, bigger, than, the, hampton, court, maze, the, center, is, about, 12m, 12m, the, maze, was, designed, and, laid, out, by, conrad, penny, the, colonial, city, of, camag, ey, cuba, founded, in, 1528, layout, resembles, a, real, maze, with, narrow, short, streets, always, turning, in, one, direction, or, another, after, pirate, henry, morgan, burned, the, city, in, the, 17th, century, it, was, designed, like, a, maze, so, attackers, would, find, it, hard, to, move, around, inside, the, city, it, is, a, unesco, world, heritage, site
