centuries, from, the, standpoint, of, anthropology, and, sociology, courtship, is, linked, with, other, institutions, such, as, marriage, and, the, family, which, have, changed, rapidly, having, been, subject, to, the, effects, of, advances, in, technology, and, medicine, in, the, past, marriages, in, most, societies, were, arranged, by, parents, and, older, relatives, with, the, goal, not, being, love, but, legacy, and, economic, stability, and, political, alliances, according, to, anthropologists, accordingly, there, was, little, need, for, a, temporary, trial, period, such, as, courtship, before, a, permanent, community, recognized, union, was, formed, between, a, man, and, a, woman, while, pair, bonds, of, varying, forms, were, recognized, by, most, societies, as, acceptable, social, arrangements, marriage, was, reserved, for, heterosexual, pairings, and, had, a, transactional, nature, where, wives, were, in, many, cases, a, form, of, property, being, exchanged, between, father,

demanded, people, get, married, before, having, a, sexual, relationship, and, many, societies, found, that, some, formally, recognized, bond, between, a, man, and, a, woman, was, the, best, way, of, rearing, and, educating, children, as, well, as, helping, to, avoid, conflicts, and, misunderstandings, regarding, competition, for, mates, generally, during, much, of, recorded, history, of, humans, in, civilization, and, into, the, middle, ages, in, europe, marriages, were, seen, as, business, arrangements, between, families, while, romance, was, something, that, happened, outside, of, marriage, discreetly, such, as, covert, meetings, the, 12th, century, book, the, art, of, courtly, love, advised, that, true, love, can, have, no, place, between, husband, and, wife, according, to, one, view, clandestine, meetings, between, men, and, women, generally, outside, of, marriage, or, before, marriage, were, the, precursors, to, today, s, courtship, from, about, 1700, a, worldwide, movement, perhaps, described, as, the, empowerment, of, the, individual, took, hold, leading, towards, greater, emancipation, of, women, and, equality, of, individuals, men, and, women, became, more, equal, politically, financially, and, socially, in, many, nations, in, the, early, 20th, centuries, women, gradually, won, the, right, to, vote, starting, in, the, first, sovereign, nation, norway, in, 1913, and, to, own, property, and, receive, equal, treatment, by, the, law, and, these, changes, had, profound, impacts, on, the, relationships, between, men, and, women, and, parental, influence, declined, in, many, societies, individuals, could, decide, on, their, own, whether, they, should, marry, whom, they, should, marry, and, when, they, should, marry, in, a, courtship, ritual, where, young, women, entertained, gentleman, callers, usually, in, the, home, under, the, watchful, eye, of, a, chaperone, but, increasingly, in, many, western, countries, it, became, a, self, initiated, activity, with, two, young, people, going, out, as, a, couple, in, public, together, still, courtship, varies, considerably, by, nation, custom, religious, upbringing, technology, and, social, class, and, important, exceptions, with, regards, to, individual, freedoms, remain, as, many, countries, today, still, practice, arranged, marriages, request, dowries, and, forbid, same, sex, pairings, although, in, many, countries, movies, meals, and, meeting, in, coffeehouses, and, other, places, is, now, popular, as, are, advice, books, suggesting, various, strategies, for, men, and, women, in, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, in, south, asia, and, many, parts, of, the, middle, east, being, alone, in, public, as, a, couple, is, not, only, frowned, upon, but, can, even, lead, to, either, person, being, socially, ostracized, the, 1849, book, the, whole, art, of, polite, courtship, or, the, ladies, gentlemen, s, love, letter, writer, exemplifies, the, importance, of, love, letters, in, 19th, century, courtship, with, a, goal, of, marriage, the, book, contains, 31, love, letter, samples, for, men, and, women, in, different, careers, presumably, for, readers, to, draw, inspiration, when, writing, their, own, romantic, correspondences, etiquette, books, such, as, the, 1852, etiquette, of, courtship, and, matrimony, detail, socially, appropriate, ways, to, meet, lovers, court, arrange, a, wedding, honeymoon, and, avoid, arguments, in, the, twentieth, century, courtship, was, sometimes, seen, as, a, precursor, to, marriage, but, it, could, also, be, considered, as, an, end, in, itself, that, is, an, informal, social, activity, akin, to, friendship, it, generally, happened, in, that, portion, of, a, person, s, life, before, the, age, of, marriage, but, as, marriage, became, less, permanent, with, the, advent, of, divorce, courtship, could, happen, at, other, times, in, peoples, lives, as, well, people, became, more, mobile, rapidly, developing, technology, played, a, huge, role, new, communication, technology, such, as, the, telephone, internet, and, text, messaging, enabled, rendezvous, to, be, arranged, without, face, to, face, contact, cars, extended, the, range, of, courtship, as, well, as, enabled, back, seat, sexual, exploration, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, the, advent, of, birth, control, as, well, as, safer, procedures, for, abortion, changed, the, equation, considerably, and, there, was, less, pressure, to, marry, as, a, means, for, satisfying, sexual, urges, new, types, of, relationships, formed, it, was, possible, for, people, to, live, together, without, marrying, and, without, children, information, about, human, sexuality, grew, and, with, it, an, acceptance, of, all, types, of, consensual, sexual, orientations, is, becoming, more, common, today, the, institution, of, courtship, continues, to, evolve, at, a, rapid, rate, with, new, possibilities, and, choices, opening, up, particularly, through, online, courtship, humans, have, been, compared, to, other, species, in, terms, of, sexual, behavior, neurobiologist, robert, sapolsky, constructed, a, reproductive, spectrum, with, opposite, poles, being, tournament, species, in, which, males, compete, fiercely, for, reproductive, privileges, with, females, and, pair, bond, arrangements, in, which, a, male, and, female, will, bond, for, life, according, to, sapolsky, humans, are, somewhat, in, the, middle, of, this, spectrum, in, the, sense, that, humans, form, pair, bonds, but, there, is, the, possibility, of, cheating, or, changing, partners, these, species, particular, behavior, patterns, provide, a, context, for, aspects, of, human, reproduction, including, courtship, however, one, particularity, of, the, human, species, is, that, pair, bonds, are, often, formed, without, necessarily, having, the, intention, of, reproduction, in, modern, times, emphasis, on, the, institution, of, marriage, traditionally, described, as, a, male, female, bond, has, obscured, pair, bonds, formed, by, same, sex, and, transgender, couples, and, that, many, heterosexual, couples, also, bond, for, life, without, offspring, or, that, often, pairs, that, do, have, offspring, separate, thus, the, concept, of, marriage, is, changing, widely, in, many, countries, the, average, duration, of, courtship, varies, considerably, throughout, the, world, furthermore, there, is, vast, individual, variation, between, couples, courtship, may, be, completely, omitted, as, in, cases, of, some, arranged, marriages, where, the, couple, do, not, meet, before, the, wedding, in, the, united, kingdom, a, poll, of, 3, 000, engaged, or, married, couples, resulted, in, an, average, duration, between, first, meeting, and, accepted, proposal, of, marriage, of, 2, years, and, 11, months, with, the, women, feeling, ready, to, accept, at, an, average, of, 2, years, and, 7, months, regarding, duration, between, proposal, and, wedding, the, uk, poll, above, gave, an, average, of, 2, years, and, 3, months, fairly, casual, in, most, european, influenced, cultures, in, some, traditional, societies, courtship, is, a, highly, structured, activity, with, very, specific, formal, rules, in, some, societies, the, parents, or, community, propose, potential, partners, and, then, allow, limited, courtship, to, determine, whether, the, parties, are, suited, in, japan, there, is, such, a, type, of, courtship, called, omiai, with, similar, practices, called, xiangqin, in, the, greater, china, area, parents, will, hire, a, matchmaker, to, provide, pictures, and, r, sum, s, of, potential, mates, and, if, the, couple, agrees, there, will, be, a, formal, meeting, with, the, matchmaker, and, often, parents, in, attendance, the, matchmaker, and, parents, will, often, exert, pressure, on, the, couple, to, decide, whether, they, want, to, marry, after, a, few, meetings, courtship, in, the, philippines, is, one, complex, form, of, courtship, unlike, other, societies, it, takes, a, far, more, subdued, and, indirect, approach, its, complexity, involves, stages, and, it, is, considered, normal, for, courtship, to, last, a, year, or, longer, it, is, common, to, see, a, man, showing, off, by, sending, love, letters, and, love, poems, singing, romantic, songs, and, buying, gifts, for, a, woman, the, parents, are, also, seen, as, part, of, the, courtship, practice, as, their, approval, is, commonly, needed, before, courtship, may, begin, or, before, the, woman, gives, the, man, an, answer, to, his, advances, in, more, closed, societies, courtship, is, virtually, eliminated, by, the, practice, of, arranged, marriages, in, which, partners, are, chosen, for, young, people, typically, by, their, parents, forbidding, experimental, and, serial, courtship, and, sanctioning, only, arranged, matches, is, partly, a, means, of, guarding, the, chastity, of, young, people, and, partly, a, matter, of, furthering, family, interests, which, in, such, cultures, may, be, considered, more, important, than, individual, romantic, preferences, throughout, history, courtship, has, often, included, traditions, such, as, exchanging, valentines, written, correspondence, facilitated, by, the, creation, of, the, postal, service, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, similar, communication, based, courting, over, recent, decades, though, the, concept, of, arranged, marriage, has, changed, or, simply, been, mixed, with, other, forms, of, courtship, including, eastern, and, indian, ones, potential, couples, have, the, opportunity, to, meet, and, socialise, with, each, other, before, deciding, whether, to, continue, the, relationship, courtship, is, used, by, a, number, of, theorists, to, explain, gendering, processes, and, sexual, identity, scientific, research, into, courtship, began, in, the, 1980s, after, which, time, academic, researchers, started, to, generate, theories, about, modern, courtship, practices, and, norms, researchers, have, found, that, contrary, to, popular, beliefs, courtship, is, normally, triggered, and, controlled, by, women, driven, mainly, by, non, verbal, behaviours, to, which, men, respond, one, of, the, functions, of, romantic, love, is, courtship, this, is, generally, supported, by, other, theorists, who, specialise, in, the, study, of, body, language, there, are, some, feminist, scholars, however, who, regard, courtship, as, a, socially, constructed, and, male, led, process, organised, to, subjugate, women, farrell, reports, for, example, that, magazines, about, marriage, and, romantic, fiction, continue, to, attract, a, 98, female, readership, systematic, research, into, courtship, processes, inside, the, workplace, as, well, as, two, ten, year, studies, examining, norms, in, different, international, settings, continue, to, support, a, view, that, courtship, is, a, social, process, that, socialises, both, sexes, into, accepting, forms, of, relationship, that,

identifying, acceptable, partners, others, have, suggested, that, the, speed, and, availability, of, emerging, technologies, may, be, undermining, the, possibility, for, couples, to, have, long, term,
