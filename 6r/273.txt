a, crossword, or, crossword, puzzle, is, a, word, game, consisting, of, a, grid, of, black, and, white, squares, into, which, solvers, enter, words, or, phrases, entries, crossing, each, other, horizontally, across, and, vertically, down, according, to, a, set, of, clues, each, white, square, is, typically, filled, with, one, letter, while, the, black, squares, are, used, to, separate, entries, the, first, white, square, in, each, entry, is, typically, numbered, to, correspond, to, its, clue, crosswords, commonly, appear, in, newspapers, and, magazines, the, earliest, crosswords, that, resemble, their, modern, form, were, popularized, by, the, new, york, world, in, the, 1910s, many, variants, of, crosswords, are, popular, around, the, world, including, cryptic, crosswords, and, many, language, specific, variants, crossword, construction, in, modern, times, usually, involves, the, use, of, software, constructors, choose, a, theme, except, for, themeless, puzzles, place, the, theme, answers, in, a, grid, which, is, usually, symmetric, fill, in, the, rest, of, the, grid, and, then, write, clues, crossword, grids, such, as, those, appearing, in, most, north, american, newspapers, and, magazines, consist, mainly, of, solid, regions, of, uninterrupted, white, squares, separated, more, sparsely, by, shaded, squares, every, letter, is, checked, i, e, is, part, of, both, an, across, word, and, a, down, word, and, usually, each, answer, must, contain, at, least, three, letters, in, such, puzzles, shaded, squares, are, typically, limited, to, about, one, sixth, of, the, total, crossword, grids, elsewhere, such, as, in, britain, south, africa, india, and, australia, have, a, lattice, like, structure, with, a, higher, percentage, of, shaded, squares, around, 25, leaving, about, half, the, letters, in, an, answer, unchecked, for, example, if, the, top, row, has, an, answer, running, all, the, way, across, there, will, often, be, no, across, answers, in, the, second, row, another, tradition, in, puzzle, design, in, north, america, india, and, britain, particularly, is, that, the, grid, should, have, 180, degree, rotational, symmetry, so, that, its, pattern, appears, the, same, if, the, paper, is, turned, upside, down, most, puzzle, designs, also, require, that, all, white, cells, be, orthogonally, contiguous, that, is, connected, in, one, mass, through, shared, sides, to, form, a, single, polyomino, substantial, variants, from, the, usual, forms, exist, two, of, the, common, ones, are, barred, crosswords, which, use, bold, lines, between, squares, instead, of, shaded, squares, to, separate, answers, and, circular, designs, with, answers, entered, either, radially, or, in, concentric, circles, free, form, crosswords, criss, cross, puzzles, which, have, simple, asymmetric, designs, are, often, seen, on, school, worksheets, children, s, menus, and, other, entertainment, for, children, grids, forming, shapes, other, than, squares, are, also, occasionally, used, puzzles, are, often, one, of, several, standard, sizes, for, example, many, weekday, newspaper, puzzles, such, as, the, american, new, york, times, crossword, puzzle, are, 15, 15, squares, while, weekend, puzzles, may, be, 21, 21, 23, 23, or, 25, 25, the, new, york, times, puzzles, also, set, a, common, pattern, for, american, crosswords, by, increasing, in, difficulty, throughout, the, week, their, monday, puzzles, are, the, easiest, and, the, puzzles, get, harder, each, day, until, saturday, their, larger, sunday, puzzle, is, about, the, same, level, of, difficulty, as, a, weekday, size, thursday, puzzle, this, has, led, u, s, solvers, to, use, the, day, of, the, week, as, a, shorthand, when, describing, how, hard, a, puzzle, is, e, g, an, easy, puzzle, may, be, referred, to, as, a, monday, or, a, tuesday, a, medium, difficulty, puzzle, as, a, wednesday, and, a, truly, difficult, puzzle, as, a, saturday, typically, clues, appear, outside, the, grid, divided, into, an, across, list, and, a, down, list, the, first, cell, of, each, entry, contains, a, number, referenced, by, the, clue, lists, for, example, the, answer, to, a, clue, labeled, 17, down, is, entered, with, the, first, letter, in, the, cell, numbered, 17, proceeding, down, from, there, numbers, are, almost, never, repeated, numbered, cells, are, numbered, consecutively, usually, from, left, to, right, across, each, row, starting, with, the, top, row, and, proceeding, downward, some, japanese, crosswords, are, numbered, from, top, to, bottom, down, each, column, starting, with, the, leftmost, column, and, proceeding, right, american, style, crossword, clues, called, straight, or, quick, clues, by, those, more, familiar, with, cryptic, puzzles, are, often, simple, definitions, of, the, answers, often, a, straight, clue, is, not, in, itself, sufficient, to, distinguish, between, several, possible, answers, either, because, multiple, synonymous, answers, may, fit, or, because, the, clue, itself, is, a, homonym, e, g, lead, as, in, to, be, ahead, in, a, contest, or, lead, as, in, the, element, so, the, solver, must, make, use, of, checks, to, establish, the, correct, answer, with, certainty, for, example, the, answer, to, the, clue, pc, key, for, a, three, letter, answer, could, be, esc, alt, tab, del, or, ins, so, until, a, check, is, filled, in, giving, at, least, one, of, the, letters, the, correct, answer, cannot, be, determined, in, most, american, style, crosswords, the, majority, of, the, clues, in, the, puzzle, are, straight, clues, with, the, remainder, being, one, of, the, other, types, described, below, crossword, clues, are, generally, consistent, with, the, solutions, for, instance, clues, and, their, solutions, should, always, agree, in, tense, number, and, degree, if, a, clue, is, in, the, past, tense, so, is, the, answer, thus, traveled, on, horseback, would, be, a, valid, clue, for, the, solution, rode, but, not, for, ride, similarly, family, members, would, be, a, valid, clue, for, aunts, but, not, uncle, while, more, joyful, could, clue, happier, but, not, happiest, capitalization, of, answer, letters, is, conventionally, ignored, crossword, puzzles, are, typically, filled, in, and, their, answer, sheets, published, in, all, caps, this, ensures, a, proper, name, can, have, its, initial, capital, letter, checked, with, a, non, capitalizable, letter, in, the, intersecting, clue, some, clue, examples, the, constraints, of, the, american, style, grid, in, which, every, letter, is, checked, often, require, a, fair, number, of, answers, not, to, be, dictionary, words, as, a, result, the, following, ways, to, clue, abbreviations, and, other, non, words, although, they, can, be, found, in, straight, british, crosswords, are, much, more, common, in, american, ones, many, american, crossword, puzzles, feature, a, theme, consisting, of, a, number, of, long, entries, generally, three, to, five, in, a, standard, 15, 15, square, weekday, size, puzzle, that, share, some, relationship, type, of, pun, or, other, element, in, common, as, an, example, the, new, york, times, crossword, of, april, 26, 2005, by, sarah, keller, edited, by, will, shortz, featured, five, themed, entries, ending, in, the, different, parts, of, a, tree, squareroot, tableleaf, wardrobetrunk, brainstem, and, bankbranch, the, above, is, an, example, of, a, category, theme, where, the, theme, elements, are, all, members, of, the, same, set, other, types, of, themes, include, the, themed, crossword, puzzle, was, invented, in, 1958, by, harold, t, bers, an, advertising, executive, and, frequent, contributor, to, the, new, york, times, crossword, the, simon, schuster, crossword, puzzle, series, has, published, many, unusual, themed, crosswords, rosetta, stone, by, sam, bellotto, jr, incorporates, a, caesar, cipher, cryptogram, as, the, theme, the, key, to, breaking, the, cipher, is, the, answer, to, 1, across, another, unusual, theme, requires, the, solver, to, use, the, answer, to, a, clue, as, another, clue, the, answer, to, that, clue, is, the, real, solution, many, puzzles, feature, clues, involving, wordplay, which, are, to, be, taken, metaphorically, or, in, some, sense, other, than, their, literal, meaning, requiring, some, form, of, lateral, thinking, depending, on, the, puzzle, creator, or, the, editor, this, might, be, represented, either, with, a, question, mark, at, the, end, of, the, clue, or, with, a, modifier, such, as, maybe, or, perhaps, in, more, difficult, puzzles, the, indicator, may, be, omitted, increasing, ambiguity, between, a, literal, meaning, and, a, wordplay, meaning, examples, any, type, of, puzzle, may, contain, cross, references, where, the, answer, to, one, clue, forms, part, of, another, clue, in, which, it, is, referred, to, by, number, and, direction, e, g, a, puzzle, might, have, 1, across, clued, as, central, character, in, the, lord, of, the, rings, frodo, with, 17, down, clued, as, precious, object, for, 1, across, ring, when, an, answer, is, composed, of, multiple, or, hyphenated, words, some, crosswords, especially, in, britain, indicate, the, structure, of, the, answer, for, example, 3, 5, after, a, clue, indicates, that, the, answer, is, composed, of, a, three, letter, word, followed, by, a, five, letter, word, most, american, style, crosswords, do, not, provide, this, information, some, crossword, designers, have, started, including, a, metapuzzle, or, meta, for, short, a, second, puzzle, within, the, completed, puzzle, after, the, player, has, correctly, solved, the, crossword, puzzle, in, the, usual, fashion, the, solution, forms, the, basis, of, a, second, puzzle, the, designer, usually, includes, a, hint, to, the, metapuzzle, for, instance, the, puzzle, eight, isn, t, enough, by, matt, gaffney, gives, the, clue, this, week, s, contest, answer, is, a, three, word, phrase, whose, second, word, is, or, the, crossword, solution, includes, the, entries, brought, to, naught, might, makes, right, caught, a, straight, and, height, and, weight, which, are, all, three, word, phrases, with, two, words, ending, in, ght, the, solution, to, the, meta, is, a, similar, phrase, in, which, the, middle, word, is, or, fight, or, flight, since, september, 2015, the, wall, street, journal, friday, crossword, has, featured, a, crossword, contest, metapuzzle, with, the, prize, of, a, wsj, mug, going, to, a, reader, randomly, chosen, from, among, those, submitting, the, correct, answer, some, puzzle, grids, contain, more, than, one, correct, answer, for, the, same, set, of, clues, these, are, called, schr, dinger, or, quantum, puzzles, alluding, to, the, schr, dinger, s, cat, thought, experiment, in, quantum, physics, schr, dinger, puzzles, have, frequently, been, published, in, venues, including, fireball, crosswords, and, the, american, values, club, crosswords, and, at, least, ten, have, appeared, in, the, new, york, times, since, the, late, 1980s, the, daily, new, york, times, puzzle, for, november, 5, 1996, by, jeremiah, farrell, had, a, clue, for, 39, across, that, read, lead, story, in, tomorrow, s, newspaper, with, 43, across, the, answer, for, 43, across, was, elected, depending, on, the, outcome, of, that, day, s, presidential, election, the, answer, for, 39, across, would, have, been, correct, with, either, clinton, or, bobdole, as, would, each, of, the, corresponding, down, answers, on, september, 1, 2016, the, daily, new, york, times, puzzle, by, ben, tausig, had, four, squares, which, led, to, correct, answers, reading, both, across, and, down, if, solvers, entered, either, m, or, f, the, puzzle, s, theme, genderfluid, was, revealed, at, 37, across, in, the, center, of, the, puzzle, having, a, variable, identity, as, suggested, by, four, squares, in, this, puzzle, in, cryptic, crosswords, the, clues, are, puzzles, in, themselves, a, typical, clue, contains, both, a, definition, at, the, beginning, or, end, of, the, clue, and, wordplay, which, provides, a, way, to, manufacture, the, word, indicated, by, the, definition, and, which, may, not, parse, logically, cryptics, usually, give, the, length, of, their, answers, in, parentheses, after, the, clue, which, is, especially, useful, with, multi, word, answers, certain, signs, indicate, different, forms, of, wordplay, solving, cryptics, is, harder, to, learn, than, standard, crosswords, as, learning, to, interpret, the, different, types, of, cryptic, clues, can, take, some, practice, in, great, britain, and, throughout, much, of, the, commonwealth, cryptics, of, varying, degrees, of, difficulty, are, featured, in, many, newspapers, the, first, crosswords, with, strictly, cryptic, clues, appeared, in, the, 1920s, pioneered, by, edward, powys, mathers, he, established, the, principle, of, cryptic, crossword, clues, cryptic, crossword, clues, consist, typically, of, a, definition, and, some, type, of, word, play, cryptic, crossword, clues, need, to, be, viewed, two, ways, one, is, a, surface, reading, and, one, a, hidden, meaning, the, surface, reading, is, the, basic, reading, of, the, clue, to, look, for, key, words, and, how, those, words, are, constructed, in, the, clue, the, second, way, is, the, hidden, meaning, this, can, be, a, double, definition, an, anagram, homophone, or, words, backwards, there, are, eight, main, types, of, clues, in, cryptic, crosswords, there, are, several, types, of, wordplay, used, in, cryptics, one, is, straightforward, definition, substitution, using, parts, of, a, word, for, example, in, one, puzzle, by, mel, taub, the, answer, important, is, given, the, clue, to, bring, worker, into, the, country, may, prove, significant, the, explanation, is, that, to, import, means, to, bring, into, the, country, the, worker, is, a, worker, ant, and, significant, means, important, here, significant, is, the, straight, definition, appearing, here, at, the, end, of, the, clue, to, bring, worker, into, the, country, is, the, wordplay, definition, and, may, prove, serves, to, link, the, two, note, that, in, a, cryptic, clue, there, is, almost, always, only, one, answer, that, fits, both, the, definition, and, the, wordplay, so, that, when, one, sees, the, answer, one, knows, that, it, is, the, right, answer, although, it, can, sometimes, be, a, challenge, to, figure, out, why, it, is, the, right, answer, a, good, cryptic, clue, should, provide, a, fair, and, exact, definition, of, the, answer, while, at, the, same, time, being, deliberately, misleading, another, type, of, wordplay, used, in, cryptics, is, the, use, of, homophones, for, example, the, clue, a, few, we, hear, add, up, 3, is, the, clue, for, sum, the, straight, definition, is, add, up, meaning, totalize, the, solver, must, guess, that, we, hear, indicates, a, homophone, and, so, a, homophone, of, a, synonym, of, a, few, some, is, the, answer, other, words, relating, to, sound, or, hearing, can, be, used, to, signal, the, presence, of, a, homophone, clue, e, g, aloud, audibly, in, conversation, etc, the, double, meaning, is, commonly, used, as, another, form, of, wordplay, for, example, cat, s, tongue, 7, is, solved, by, persian, since, this, is, a, type, of, cat, as, well, as, a, tongue, or, language, this, is, the, only, type, of, cryptic, clue, without, wordplay, both, parts, of, the, clue, are, a, straight, definition, cryptics, often, include, anagrams, as, well, for, example, in, slipped, a, disc, it, s, cruel, 8, an, anagram, is, indicated, by, slipped, with, the, definition, to, aim, for, being, cruel, ignoring, all, punctuation, a, disc, it, s, produces, sadistic, colin, dexter, advised, that, usually, the, indicator, will, be, an, adjective, drunk, fancy, unusual, and, so, on, an, adverb, badly, excitedly, unexpectedly, a, past, participle, altered, broken, jumbled, or, indeed, any, phrase, giving, a, similar, meaning, embedded, words, are, another, common, trick, in, cryptics, the, clue, bigotry, aside, i, d, take, him, 9, is, solved, by, apartheid, the, straight, definition, is, bigotry, and, the, wordplay, explains, itself, indicated, by, the, word, take, since, one, word, takes, another, aside, means, apart, and, i, d, is, simply, id, so, apart, and, id, take, he, which, is, in, cryptic, crossword, usage, a, perfectly, good, synonym, for, him, the, answer, could, be, elucidated, as, apart, he, id, another, common, clue, type, is, the, hidden, clue, or, container, where, the, answer, is, hidden, in, the, text, of, the, clue, itself, for, example, made, a, dug, out, buried, and, passed, away, 4, is, solved, by, dead, the, answer, is, written, in, the, clue, made, a, dug, out, buried, indicates, that, the, answer, is, embedded, within, the, clue, there, are, numerous, other, forms, of, wordplay, found, in, cryptic, clues, backwards, words, can, be, indicated, by, words, like, climbing, retreating, or, ascending, depending, on, whether, it, is, an, across, clue, or, a, down, clue, or, by, directional, indicators, such, as, going, north, meaning, upwards, or, west, right, to, left, letters, can, be, replaced, or, removed, with, indicators, such, as, nothing, rather, than, excellence, meaning, replace, e, in, a, word, with, o, the, letter, i, can, be, indicated, by, me, or, one, the, letter, o, can, be, indicated, by, nought, nothing, zero, or, a, ring, since, it, visually, resembles, one, the, letter, x, might, be, clued, as, a, cross, or, ten, as, in, the, roman, numeral, or, an, illiterate, s, signature, or, sounds, like, your, old, flame, homophone, for, ex, senselessness, is, solved, by, e, because, e, is, what, remains, after, removing, less, ness, from, sense, with, the, different, types, of, wordplay, and, definition, possibilities, the, composer, of, a, cryptic, puzzle, is, presented, with, many, different, possible, ways, to, clue, a, given, answer, most, desirable, are, clues, that, are, clean, but, deceptive, with, a, smooth, surface, reading, that, is, the, resulting, clue, looks, as, natural, a, phrase, as, possible, the, usenet, newsgroup, rec, puzzles, crosswords, has, a, number, of, clueing, competitions, where, contestants, all, submit, clues, for, the, same, word, and, a, judge, picks, the, best, one, in, principle, each, cryptic, clue, is, usually, sufficient, to, define, its, answer, uniquely, so, it, should, be, possible, to, answer, each, clue, without, use, of, the, grid, in, practice, the, use, of, checks, is, an, important, aid, to, the, solver, these, are, common, crossword, variants, that, vary, more, from, a, regular, crossword, than, just, an, unusual, grid, shape, or, unusual, clues, these, crossword, variants, may, be, based, on, different, solving, principles, and, require, a, different, solving, skill, set, cipher, crosswords, were, invented, in, germany, in, the, 19th, century, published, under, various, trade, names, including, code, breakers, code, crackers, and, kaidoku, and, not, to, be, confused, with, cryptic, crosswords, ciphertext, puzzles, are, commonly, known, as, cryptograms, a, cipher, crossword, replaces, the, clues, for, each, entry, with, clues, for, each, white, cell, of, the, grid, an, integer, from, 1, to, 26, inclusive, is, printed, in, the, corner, of, each, the, objective, as, any, other, crossword, is, to, determine, the, proper, letter, for, each, cell, in, a, cipher, crossword, the, 26, numbers, serve, as, a, cipher, for, those, letters, cells, that, share, matching, numbers, are, filled, with, matching, letters, and, no, two, numbers, stand, for, the, same, letter, all, resultant, entries, must, be, valid, words, usually, at, least, one, number, s, letter, is, given, at, the, outset, english, language, cipher, crosswords, are, nearly, always, pangrammatic, all, letters, of, the, alphabet, appear, in, the, solution, as, these, puzzles, are, closer, to, codes, than, quizzes, they, require, a, different, skillset, many, basic, cryptographic, techniques, such, as, determining, likely, vowels, are, key, to, solving, these, given, their, pangrammaticity, a, frequent, start, point, is, locating, where, q, and, u, must, appear, in, a, diagramless, crossword, often, called, a, diagramless, for, short, or, in, the, uk, a, skeleton, crossword, or, carte, blanche, the, grid, offers, overall, dimensions, but, the, locations, of, most, of, the, clue, numbers, and, shaded, squares, are, unspecified, a, solver, must, deduce, not, only, the, answers, to, individual, clues, but, how, to, fit, together, partially, built, up, clumps, of, answers, into, larger, clumps, with, properly, set, shaded, squares, some, of, these, puzzles, follow, the, traditional, symmetry, rule, others, have, left, right, mirror, symmetry, and, others, have, greater, levels, of, symmetry, or, outlines, suggesting, other, shapes, if, the, symmetry, of, the, grid, is, given, the, solver, can, use, it, to, his, her, advantage, a, fill, in, crossword, also, known, as, crusadex, or, cruzadex, features, a, grid, and, the, full, list, of, words, to, be, entered, in, that, grid, but, does, not, give, explicit, clues, for, where, each, word, goes, the, challenge, is, figuring, out, how, to, integrate, the, list, of, words, together, within, the, grid, so, that, all, intersections, of, words, are, valid, fill, in, crosswords, may, often, have, longer, word, length, than, regular, crosswords, to, make, the, crossword, easier, to, solve, and, symmetry, is, often, disregarded, fitting, together, several, long, words, is, easier, than, fitting, together, several, short, words, because, there, are, fewer, possibilities, for, how, the, long, words, intersect, together, these, types, of, crosswords, are, also, used, to, demonstrate, artificial, intelligence, abilities, such, as, finding, solutions, to, the, puzzle, based, on, a, set, of, determined, constraints, a, cross, figure, or, crossnumber, is, the, numerical, analogy, of, a, crossword, in, which, the, solutions, to, the, clues, are, numbers, instead, of, words, clues, are, usually, arithmetical, expressions, but, can, also, be, general, knowledge, clues, to, which, the, answer, is, a, number, or, year, there, are, also, numerical, fill, in, crosswords, an, acrostic, is, a, type, of, word, puzzle, in, eponymous, acrostic, form, that, typically, consists, of, two, parts, the, first, is, a, set, of, lettered, clues, each, of, which, has, numbered, blanks, representing, the, letters, of, the, answer, the, second, part, is, a, long, series, of, numbered, blanks, and, spaces, representing, a, quotation, or, other, text, into, which, the, answers, for, the, clues, fit, in, most, forms, of, the, puzzle, the, first, letters, of, each, correct, clue, answer, read, in, order, from, clue, a, on, down, the, list, will, spell, out, the, author, of, the, quote, and, the, title, of, the, work, it, is, taken, from, this, can, be, used, as, an, additional, solving, aid, the, arroword, is, a, variant, of, a, crossword, that, does, not, have, as, many, black, squares, as, a, true, crossword, but, has, arrows, inside, the, grid, with, clues, preceding, the, arrows, it, has, been, called, the, most, popular, word, puzzle, in, many, european, countries, and, is, often, called, the, scandinavian, crossword, as, it, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, sweden, the, phrase, cross, word, puzzle, was, first, written, in, 1862, by, our, young, folks, in, the, united, states, crossword, like, puzzles, for, example, double, diamond, puzzles, appeared, in, the, magazine, st, nicholas, published, since, 1873, another, crossword, puzzle, appeared, on, september, 14, 1890, in, the, italian, magazine, il, secolo, illustrato, della, domenica, it, was, designed, by, giuseppe, airoldi, and, titled, per, passare, il, tempo, to, pass, the, time, airoldi, s, puzzle, was, a, four, by, four, grid, with, no, shaded, squares, it, included, horizontal, and, vertical, clues, crosswords, in, england, during, the, 19th, century, were, of, an, elementary, kind, apparently, derived, from, the, word, square, a, group, of, words, arranged, so, the, letters, read, alike, vertically, and, horizontally, and, printed, in, children, s, puzzle, books, and, various, periodicals, on, december, 21, 1913, arthur, wynne, a, journalist, born, in, liverpool, england, published, a, word, cross, puzzle, in, the, new, york, world, that, embodied, most, of, the, features, of, the, modern, genre, this, puzzle, is, frequently, cited, as, the, first, crossword, puzzle, and, wynne, as, the, inventor, an, illustrator, later, reversed, the, word, cross, name, to, cross, word, crossword, puzzles, became, a, regular, weekly, feature, in, the, new, york, world, and, spread, to, other, newspapers, the, pittsburgh, press, for, example, was, publishing, them, at, least, as, early, as, 1916, and, the, boston, globe, by, 1917, by, the, 1920s, the, crossword, phenomenon, was, starting, to, attract, notice, in, october, 1922, newspapers, published, a, comic, strip, by, clare, briggs, entitled, movie, of, a, man, doing, the, cross, word, puzzle, with, an, enthusiast,

judging, from, the, number, of, solvers, in, the, subway, and, l, trains, the, crossword, puzzle, bids, fair, to, become, a, fad, with, new, yorkers, also, in, 1925, the, new, york, public, library, reported, that, the, latest, craze, to, strike, libraries, is, the, crossword, puzzle, and, complained, that, when, the, puzzle, fans, swarm, to, the, dictionaries, and, encyclopedias, so, as, to, drive, away, readers, and, students, who, need, these, books, in, their, daily, work, can, there, be, any, doubt, of, the, library, s, duty, to, protect, its, legitimate, readers, the, first, book, of, crossword, puzzles, was, published, by, simon, schuster, in, 1924, after, a, suggestion, from, co, founder, richard, simon, s, aunt, the, publisher, was, initially, skeptical, that, the, book, would, succeed, and, only, printed, a, small, run, at, first, the, book, was, promoted, with, an, included, pencil, and, this, odd, looking, book, with, a, pencil, attached, to, it, was, an, instant, hit, leading, crossword, puzzles, to, become, a, craze, of, 1924, to, help, promote, its, books, simon, schuster, also, founded, the, amateur, cross, word, puzzle, league, of, america, which, began, the, process, of, developing, standards, for, puzzle, design, not, all, of, the, attention, drawn, to, the, crossword, puzzle, fad, was, positive, a, 1924, editorial, in, the, new, york, times, complained, of, the, sinful, waste, in, the, utterly, futile, finding, of, words, the, letters, of, which, will, fit, into, a, prearranged, pattern, more, or, less, complex, this, is, not, a, game, at, all, and, it, hardly, can, be, called, a, sport, get, nothing, out, of, it, except, a, primitive, form, of, mental, exercise, and, success, or, failure, in, any, given, attempt, is, equally, irrelevant, to, mental, development, a, clergyman, called, the, working, of, crossword, puzzles, the, mark, of, a, childish, mentality, and, said, there, is, no, use, for, persons, to, pretend, that, working, one, of, the, puzzles, carries, any, intellectual, value, with, it, however, another, wrote, a, complete, bible, cross, word, puzzle, book, also, in, 1925, time, magazine, noted, that, nine, manhattan, dailies, and, fourteen, other, big, newspapers, were, carrying, crosswords, and, quoted, opposing, views, as, to, whether, this, crossword, craze, will, positively, end, by, june, or, the, crossword, puzzle, is, here, to, stay, in, 1925, the, new, york, times, noted, with, approval, a, scathing, critique, of, crosswords, by, the, new, republic, but, concluded, that, fortunately, the, question, of, whether, the, puzzles, are, beneficial, or, harmful, is, in, no, urgent, need, of, an, answer, the, craze, evidently, is, dying, out, fast, and, in, a, few, months, it, will, be, forgotten, and, in, 1929, declared, the, cross, word, puzzle, it, seems, has, gone, the, way, of, all, fads, in, 1930, a, correspondent, noted, that, together, with, the, times, of, london, yours, is, the, only, journal, of, prominence, that, has, never, succumbed, to, the, lure, of, the, cross, word, puzzle, and, said, that, the, craze, the, fad, stage, has, passed, but, there, are, still, people, numbering, it, to, the, millions, who, look, for, their, daily, cross, word, puzzle, as, regularly, as, for, the, weather, predictions, the, term, crossword, first, appeared, in, the, oxford, english,

times, and, other, venues, women, editors, such, as, margaret, farrar, were, influential, in, the, first, few, decades, of, puzzle, making, and, women, constructors, such, as, bernice, gordon, and, elizabeth, gorski, have, each, contributed, hundreds, of, puzzles, to, the, new, york, times, however, in, recent, years, the, number, of, women, constructors, has, declined, during, the, years, that, will, weng, and, eugene, maleska, edited, the, new, york, times, crossword, 1969, 1993, women, constructors, accounted, for, 35, of, puzzles, while, during, the, editorship, of, will, shortz, 1993, present, this, percentage, has, gone, down, with, women, constructors, including, collaborations, accounting, for, only, 15, of, puzzles, in, both, 2014, and, 2015, 17, of, puzzles, published, in, 2016, 13, the, lowest, in, the, shortz, era, in, 2017, and, 16, in, 2018, several, reasons, have, been, given, for, the, decline, in, women, constructors, one, explanation, is, that, the, gender, imbalance, in, crossword, construction, is, similar, to, that, in, related, fields, such, as, journalism, and, that, more, freelance, male, constructors, than, females, submit, puzzles, on, spec, to, the, new, york, times, and, other, outlets, another, explanation, is, that, computer, assisted, construction, and, the, increased, influence, of, computational, approaches, in, generating, word, lists, may, be, making, crossword, construction, more, like, stem, fields, in, which, women, are, underrepresented, for, a, number, of, factors, however, it, has, also, been, argued, that, this, explanation, risks, propagating, myths, about, gender, and, technology, some, have, argued, that, the, relative, absence, of, women, constructors, and, editors, has, had, an, influence, on, the, content, of, the, puzzles, themselves, and, that, clues, and, entries, can, be, insensitive, regarding, language, related, to, gender, and, race, margaret, irvine, suggested, that, lack, of, confidence, was, a, barrier, several, approaches, have, been, suggested, to, develop, more, women, in, the, field, including, mentoring, novice, women, constructors, and, encouraging, women, constructors, to, publish, their, puzzles, independently, crossword, venues, other, than, new, york, times, have, recently, published, higher, percentages, of, women, than, that, puzzle, in, the, spring, of, 2018, patti, varol, and, amy, reynaldo, organized, and, edited, a, pack, of, 18, puzzles, constructed, by, women, called, women, of, letters, inspired, by, this, laura, braunstein, and, tracy, bennett, launched, the, inkubator, a, twice, monthly, subscription, service, that, will, publish, crosswords, constructed, by, cis, women, trans, women, and, woman, aligned, constructors, the, inkubator, raised, over, 30, 000, in, its, initial, kickstarter, campaign, and, began, publishing, puzzles, on, january, 17, 2019, a, book, of, 100, puzzles, inkubator, crosswords, 100, audacious, puzzles, by, women, and, nonbinary, creators, was, published, in, 2022, on, february, 8, 2023, they, announced, to, subscribers, that, 2023, would, be, their, final, year, as, a, subscription, service, owing, to, the, large, number, of, words, ending, with, a, vowel, italian, crossword, makers, have, perhaps, the, most, difficult, task, the, right, margin, and, the, bottom, can, be, particularly, difficult, to, put, together, from, such, a, perspective, swedish, crossword, makers, have, a, far, easier, task, especially, in, the, large, picture, crosswords, both, conjugation, of, verbs, and, declension, of, adjectives, and, nouns, are, allowed, a, swedish, clue, like, kan, s, ttas, i, munnen, sked, can, be, put, in, the, mouth, spoon, can, be, grammatically, changed, den, kan,

many, countries, and, languages, in, languages, other, than, english, the, status, of, diacritics, varies, according, to, the, orthography, of, the, particular, language, thus, french, language, crosswords, are, smaller, than, english, language, ones, and, not, necessarily, square, there, are, usually, 8, 13, rows, and, columns, totaling, 81, 130, squares, they, need, not, be, symmetric, and, two, letter, words, are, allowed, unlike, in, most, english, language, puzzles, compilers, strive, to, minimize, use, of, shaded, squares, a, black, square, usage, of, 10, is, typical, georges, perec, compiled, many, 9, 9, grids, for, le, point, with, four, or, even, three, black, squares, rather, than, numbering, the, individual, clues, the, rows, and, columns, are, numbered, as, on, a, chessboard, all, clues, for, a, given, row, or, column, are, listed, against, its, number, as, separate, sentences, in, italy, crosswords, are, usually, oblong, and, larger, than, french, ones, 13,

hebrew, is, normally, written, with, only, the, consonants, vowels, are, either, understood, or, entered, as, diacritical, marks, this, can, lead, to, ambiguities, in, the, entry, of, some, words,

left, but, roman, numerals, are, used, and, written, from, left, to, right, there, can, be, an, ambiguity, in, the, description, of, lengths, of, entries, particularly, for, multi, word, phrases, different, compilers, and, publications, use, differing, conventions, for, both, of, these, issues, in, the, japanese, language, crossword, because, of, the, writing, system, one, syllable, typically, katakana, is, entered, into, each, white, cell, of, the, grid, rather, than, one, letter, resulting, in, the, typical, solving, grid, seeming, small, in, comparison, to, those, of, other, languages, any, second, y, on, character, is, treated, as, a, full, syllable, and, is, rarely, written, with, a, smaller, character, even, cipher, crosswords, have, a, japanese, equivalent, although, pangrammaticity, does, not, apply, crosswords, with, kanji, to, fill, in, are, also, produced, but, in, far, smaller, number, as, it, takes, far, more, effort, to, construct, one, despite, japanese, having, three, writing, forms, hiragana, katakana, and, kanji, they, are, rarely, mixed, in, a, single, crossword, puzzle, the, design, of, japanese, crossword, grids, often, follows, two, additional, rules, that, shaded, cells, may, not, share, a, side, i, e, they, may, not, be, orthogonally, contiguous, and, that, the, corner, squares, must, be, white, a, n, prahlada, rao, based, in, bangalore,

case, the, convention, is, for, the, answer, to, go, horizontally, to, the, right, of, the, clue, cell, or, if, the, clue, cell, is, split, vertically, and, contains, two, clues, for, the, answer, to, go, horizontally, to, the, right, for, the, top, clue, and, vertically, below, for, the, bottom, clue, this, style, of, grid, is, also, used, in, several, countries, other, than, sweden, often, in, magazines, but, also, in, daily, newspapers, the, grid, often, has, one, or, more, photos, replacing, a, block, of, squares, as, a, clue, to, one, or, several, answers, for, example, the, name, of, a, pop, star, or, some, kind, of, rhyme, or, phrase, that, can, be, associated, with, the, photo, these, puzzles, usually, have, no, symmetry, in, the, grid, but, instead, often, have, a, common, theme, literature, music, nature, geography, events, of, a, special, year, etc, this, tradition, prospered, already, in, the, mid, 1900s, in, family, magazines, and, sections, of, newspapers, then, the,

tuesdays, as, part, of, the, ongoing, competition, between, the, two, newspapers, in, typical, themed, american, style, crosswords, the, theme, is, created, first, as, a, set, of, symmetric, long, across, answers, will, be, needed, around, which, the, grid, can, be, created, since, the, grid, will, typically, have, 180, degree, rotational, symmetry, the, answers, will, need, to, be, also, thus, a, typical, 15, 15, square, american, puzzle, might, have, two, 15, letter, entries, and, two, 13, letter, entries, that, could, be, arranged, appropriately, in, the, grid, e, g, one, 15, letter, entry, in, the, third, row, and, the, other, symmetrically, in, the, 13th, row, one, 13, letter, entry, starting, in, the, first, square, of, the, 6th, row, and, the, other, ending, in, the, last, square, of, the, 10th, row, the, theme, must, not, only, be, funny, or, interesting, but, also, internally, consistent, in, the, april, 26, 2005, by, sarah, keller, mentioned, above, the, five, themed, entries, contained, in, the, different, parts, of, a, tree, squareroot, tableleaf, wardrobetrunk, brainstem, and, bankbranch, in, this, puzzle, charter, oak, would, not, be, an, appropriate, entry, as, all, the, other, entries, contain, different, parts, of, a, tree, not, the, name, of, a, kind, of, tree, similarly, family, tree, would, not, be, appropriate, unless, it, were, used, as, a, revealer, for, the, theme, frequently, clued, with, a, phrase, along, the, lines, and, a, hint, to, given, the, existing, entries, seed, money, would, also, be, unacceptable, as, all, the, other, theme, entries, end, in, the, part, of, a, tree, as, opposed, to, beginning, with, it, though, the, puzzle, could, certainly, be, changed, to, have, a, mix, of, words, in, different, positions, once, a, consistent, appropriate, theme, has, been, chosen, a, grid, is, designed, around, that, theme, following, a, set, of, basic, principles, crossword, puzzle, payments, for, standard, 15, 15, puzzles, from, the, major, outlets, range, from, 50, games, to, 500, the, new, york, times, while, payments, for, 21, 21, puzzles, range, from, 250, newsday, to, 1, 500, the, new, york, times, the, compensation, structure, of, crosswords, generally, entails, authors, selling, all, rights, to, their, puzzles, upon, publication, and, as, a, result, receiving, no, royalties, from, republication, of, their, work, in, books, or, other, forms, software, that, aids, in, creating, crossword, puzzles, has, been, written, since, at, least, 1976, one, popular, example, was, crossword, magic, for, the, apple, ii, in, the, 1980s, the, earliest, software, relied, on, people, to, input, a, list, of, fill, words, and, clues, and, automatically, maps, the, answers, onto, a, suitable, grid, this, is, a, search, problem, in, computer, science, because, there, are, many, possible, arrangements, to, be, checked, against, the, rules, of, construction, any, given, set, of, answers, might, have, zero, one, or, multiple, legal, arrangements, modern, open, source, libraries, exist, that, attempt, to, efficiently, generate, legal, arrangements, from, a, given, set, of, answers, in, the, late, 1990s, the, transition, began, from, mostly, hand, created, arrangements, to, computer, assisted, which, creators, generally, say, has, allowed, authors, to, produce, more, interesting, and, creative, puzzles, reducing, crosswordese, modern, software, includes, large, databases, of, clues, and, answers, allowing, the, computer, to, randomly, select, words, for, the, puzzle, potentially, with, guidance, from, the, user, as, to, the, theme, or, a, specific, set, of, words, to, pick, with, greater, probability, many, serious, users, add, words, to, the, database, as, an, expression, of, personal, creativity, or, for, use, in, a, desired, theme, software, can, also, be, used, to, assist, the, user, in, finding, words, for, a, specific, spot, in, an, arrangement, by, quickly, searching, through, the, dictionary, for, all, words, that, fit, in, 1998, in, jakarta, publisher, elex, media, komputindo, gramedia, group, published, a, crossword, software, entitled, teka, teki,
