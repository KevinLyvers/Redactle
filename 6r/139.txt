https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice
juice, is, a, drink, made, from, the, extraction, or, pressing, of, the, natural, liquid, contained, in, fruit, and, vegetables, it, can, also, refer, to, liquids, that, are, flavored, with, concentrate, or, other, biological, food, sources, such, as, meat, or, seafood, such, as, clam, juice, juice, is, commonly, consumed, as, a, beverage, or, used, as, an, ingredient, or, flavoring, in, foods, or, other, beverages, such, as, smoothies, juice, emerged, as, a, popular, beverage, choice, after, the, development, of, pasteurization, methods, enabled, its, preservation, without, using, fermentation, which, is, used, in, wine, production, the, largest, fruit, juice, consumers, are, new, zealand, nearly, a, cup, or, 8, ounces, each, day, and, colombia, more, than, three, quarters, of, a, cup, each, day, fruit, juice, consumption, on, average, increases, with, a, country, s, income, level, the, word, juice, comes, from, old, french, in, about, 1300, it, developed, from, the, old, french, words, jus, juis, jouis, which, mean, liquid, obtained, by, boiling, herbs, the, old, french, jus, juice, sap, liquid, 13c, from, latin, ius, broth, sauce, juice, soup, from, pie, root, yeue, to, blend, mix, food, cognates, sanskrit, yus, broth, greek, zyme, a, leaven, old, church, slavonic, jucha, broth, soup, russian, ukha, lithuanian, juse, fish, soup, the, use, of, the, word, juice, to, mean, the, watery, part, of, fruits, or, vegetables, was, first, recorded, in, the, early, 14th, century, since, the, 19th, century, the, term, juice, has, also, been, used, in, a, figurative, sense, e, g, to, mean, alcohol, or, electricity, today, au, jus, refers, to, meat, served, along, with, its, own, juice, commonly, as, a, gravy, groups, of, grape, pits, dated, to, 8000, bce, show, early, evidence, of, juice, production, although, it, is, thought, that, the, grapes, may, have, been, alternatively, used, to, produce, wine, one, of, the, first, regularly, produced, juices, was, lemonade, which, appeared, in, 16th, century, italy, as, an, import, after, its, conception, in, the, middle, east, orange, juice, originated, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, 18th, century, james, lind, linked, citrus, fruits, to, the, prevention, of, scurvy, which, a, century, later, led, to, the, implementation, of, the, merchant, shipping, act, of, 1867, requiring, all, ocean, bound, british, ships, to, carry, citrus, based, juice, on, board, in, 1869, a, dentist, by, the, name, of, thomas, b, welch, developed, a, pasteurization, method, that, allowed, for, the, storage, of, juice, without, the, juice, fermenting, into, alcohol, his, method, involved, filtering, squeezed, grape, juice, into, bottles, sealing, them, with, cork, and, wax, and, then, placing, them, in, boiling, water, this, method, kills, the, yeast, responsible, for, fermentation, he, then, sold, his, new, product, as, dr, welch, s, unfermented, wine, in, the, late, 18th, century, united, states, the, circulation, of, foreign, fruit, juices, was, heavily, regulated, by, tariffs, the, mckinley, tariff, act, of, 1890, increased, import, taxes, from, 38, to, 49, 5, percent, and, set, taxes, on, fruit, juices, based, on, the, alcohol, content, of, the, drink, juices, with, 18, or, less, alcohol, were, taxed, at, 60, cents, per, gallon, while, anything, above, 18, was, taxed, at, us, 2, 50, per, proof, gallon, in, the, united, kingdom, the, name, or, names, of, the, fruit, followed, by, juice, can, only, legally, be, used, to, describe, a, product, that, is, 100, fruit, juice, as, required, by, the, fruit, juices, and, fruit, nectars, england, regulations, and, the, fruit, juices, and, fruit, nectars, scotland, regulations, 2003, however, a, juice, made, by, reconstituting, concentrate, can, be, called, juice, a, product, described, as, fruit, nectar, must, contain, at, least, 25, to, 50, juice, depending, on, the, fruit, a, juice, or, nectar, including, concentrate, must, state, that, it, does, the, term, juice, drink, is, not, defined, in, the, regulations, and, can, be, used, to, describe, any, drink, that, includes, juice, whatever, the, amount, comparable, rules, apply, in, all, eu, member, states, in, their, respective, languages, in, the, us, fruit, juice, can, only, legally, be, used, to, describe, a, product, that, is, 100, fruit, juice, a, blend, of, fruit, juice, s, with, other, ingredients, such, as, high, fructose, corn, syrup, is, called, a, juice, cocktail, or, juice, drink, according, to, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, the, term, nectar, is, generally, accepted, in, the, us, and, in, international, trade, for, a, diluted, juice, to, denote, a, beverage, that, contains, fruit, juice, or, puree, water, and, artificial, sweeteners, no, added, sugar, is, commonly, printed, on, the, labels, of, juice, containers, but, the, products, may, contain, large, amounts, of, naturally, occurring, sugars, however, sugar, content, is, listed, with, other, carbohydrates, on, labels, in, many, countries, depending, on, trends, and, regulations, beverages, listed, as, 100, juice, may, actually, contain, unlisted, additives, for, example, most, orange, juice, contains, added, ethyl, butyrate, to, enhance, flavor, vitamin, c, as, ascorbic, acid, and, water, if, from, concentrate, when, fruit, juice, is, too, sour, acidic, or, rich, to, consume, it, may, be, diluted, with, water, and, sugar, to, create, an, ade, such, as, lemonade, limeade, cherryade, and, orangeade, the, ade, suffix, may, also, refer, to, any, sweetened, fruit, flavored, drink, whether, or, not, it, actually, contains, any, juice, the, largest, fruit, juice, consumers, are, new, zealand, nearly, a, cup, or, 8, ounces, each, day, and, colombia, more, than, three, quarters, of, a, cup, each, day, fruit, juice, consumption, on, average, increased, with, country, income, level, in, 2007, a, report, stated, that, fruit, juice, consumption, overall, in, europe, australia, new, zealand, and, the, us, had, increased, in, recent, years, in, 2015, people, in, the, united, states, consumed, approximately, 6, 6, us, gallons, of, juice, per, capita, with, more, than, half, of, preschool, age, children, being, regular, drinkers, juice, is, prepared, by, mechanically, squeezing, or, macerating, sometimes, referred, to, as, cold, pressing, fruit, or, vegetable, flesh, without, the, application, of, heat, or, solvents, for, example, orange, juice, is, the, liquid, extract, of, the, fruit, of, the, orange, tree, and, tomato, juice, is, the, liquid, that, results, from, pressing, the, fruit, of, the, tomato, plant, juice, may, be, prepared, at, home, from, fresh, fruit, and, vegetables, using, a, variety, of, hand, or, electric, juicers, many, commercial, juices, are, filtered, to, remove, fiber, or, pulp, but, high, pulp, fresh, orange, juice, is, a, popular, beverage, additives, are, put, in, some, juices, such, as, sugar, and, artificial, flavours, in, some, fruit, juice, based, beverages, or, savoury, seasonings, e, g, in, clamato, or, caesar, tomato, juice, drinks, common, methods, for, the, preservation, and, processing, of, fruit, juices, include, canning, pasteurization, concentrating, freezing, evaporation, and, spray, drying, although, processing, methods, vary, between, juices, the, general, processing, method, of, juices, includes, after, the, fruits, are, picked, and, washed, the, juice, is, extracted, by, one, of, two, automated, methods, in, the, first, method, two, metal, cups, with, sharp, metal, tubes, on, the, bottom, cup, come, together, removing, the, peel, and, forcing, the, flesh, of, the, fruit, through, the, metal, tube, the, juice, of, the, fruit, then, escapes, through, small, holes, in, the, tube, the, peels, can, then, be, used, further, and, are, washed, to, remove, oils, which, are, reclaimed, later, for, usage, the, second, method, requires, the, fruits, to, be, cut, in, half, before, being, subjected, to, reamers, which, extract, the, juice, after, the, juice, is, filtered, it, may, be, concentrated, in, evaporators, which, reduce, the, size, of, the, juice, by, a, factor, of, 5, making, it, easier, to, transport, and, increasing, its, expiration, date, juices, are, concentrated, by, heating, under, a, vacuum, to, remove, water, and, then, cooling, to, around, 13, degrees, celsius, about, two, thirds, of, the, water, in, a, juice, is, removed, the, juice, is, later, reconstituted, a, process, in, which, the, concentrate, is, mixed, with, water, and, other, factors, to, restore, any, lost, flavor, from, the, concentrating, process, juices, can, also, be, sold, in, a, concentrated, state, in, which, the, consumer, adds, water, to, the, concentrated, juice, as, preparation, juices, are, then, pasteurized, and, filled, into, containers, often, while, still, hot, if, the, juice, is, poured, into, a, container, while, hot, it, is, cooled, as, quickly, as, possible, packages, that, cannot, stand, heat, require, sterile, conditions, for, filling, chemicals, such, as, hydrogen, peroxide, can, be, used, to, sterilize, containers, plants, can, make, anywhere, from, 1, to, 20, tonnes, a, day, high, intensity, pulsed, electric, fields, are, being, used, as, an, alternative, to, heat, pasteurization, in, fruit, juices, heat, treatments, sometimes, fail, to, make, a, quality, microbiologically, stable, product, however, it, was, found, that, processing, with, high, intensity, pulsed, electric, fields, pef, can, be, applied, to, fruit, juices, to, provide, a, shelf, stable, and, safe, product, in, addition, it, was, found, that, pulsed, electric, fields, provide, a, fresh, like, product, with, high, nutritional, value, pulsed, electric, field, processing, is, a, type, of, nonthermal, method, for, food, preservation, pulsed, electric, fields, use, short, pulses, of, electricity, to, inactivate, microbes, in, addition, the, use, of, pef, results, in, minimal, detrimental, effects, on, the, quality, of, the, food, pefs, kill, microorganisms, and, provide, better, maintenance, of, the, original, colour, flavour, and, nutritional, value, of, the, food, as, compared, to, heat, treatments, this, method, of, preservation, works, by, placing, two, electrodes, between, liquid, juices, then, applying, high, voltage, pulses, for, microseconds, to, milliseconds, the, high, voltage, pulses, have, an, intensity, in, the, range, of, 10, to, 80, kv, cm, the, processing, time, of, the, juice, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, number, of, pulses, by, the, effective, pulse, duration, the, high, voltage, of, the, pulses, produces, an, electric, field, that, results, in, the, inactivation, of, microbes, that, may, be, present, in, the, juice, the, pef, temperatures, are, below, the, temperatures, used, in, thermal, processing, after, the, high, voltage, treatment, the, juice, is, aseptically, packaged, and, refrigerated, juice, is, also, able, to, transfer, electricity, due, to, the, presence, of, several, ions, from, the, processing, when, the, electric, field, is, applied, to, the, juice, electric, currents, are, then, able, to, flow, into, the, liquid, juice, and, be, transferred, around, due, to, the, charged, molecules, in, the, juice, therefore, pulsed, electric, fields, are, able, to, inactivate, microorganisms, extend, shelf, life, and, reduce, the, enzymatic, activity, of, the, juice, while, maintaining, similar, quality, as, the, original, fresh, pressed, juice, fruit, juices, contain, compounds, that, can, be, undesirable, to, consumers, apple, juices, can, be, cloudy, and, grapefruit, juices, can, be, bitter, enzymatic, technologies, involving, respectively, pectinases, and, naringinase, address, these, problems, juices, are, often, consumed, for, their, perceived, health, benefits, for, example, orange, juice, with, natural, or, added, vitamin, c, folic, acid, and, potassium, juice, provides, nutrients, such, as, carotenoids, polyphenols, and, vitamin, c, that, offer, health, benefits, high, consumption, of, fruit, juice, with, added, sugar, may, be, linked, to, weight, gain, but, not, all, studies, have, shown, this, effect, if, 100, from, fruit, juice, can, help, meet, daily, intake, recommendations, for, some, nutrients, research, suggests, that, 100, fruit, juice, is, not, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, diabetes, a, 2018, review, concluded, that, 100, fruit, juice, increases, the, risk, of, tooth, decay, in, children, but, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, consumption, of, 100, fruit, juice, has, adverse, health, effects, preliminary, research, indicates, that, cranberry, juice, or, capsules, may, decrease, the, number, of, urinary, tract, infections, in, women, with, frequent, infections, and, a, more, substantial, cochrane, review, concludes, that, there, is, some, evidence, that, cranberry, products, reduce, the, risk, of, symptomatic, urinary, tract, infections, for, women, children, and, people, following, intervention, but, not, for, the, elderly, people, with, bladder, emptying, problems, or, pregnant, women, long, term, tolerance, is, also, an, issue, with, gastrointestinal, upset, occurring, in, more, than, 30, of, people, as, of, 2017, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, says, that, fruit, juice, should, not, be, given, to, children, under, the, age, of, one, due, to, its, lack, of, nutritional, benefit, for, children, ages, one, to, six, intake, of, fruit, juice, should, be, limited, to, less, than, 4, 6, oz, 110, 170, g, per, day, about, a, half, to, three, quarters, of, a, cup, due, to, its, high, sugar, and, low, fiber, content, compared, to, fruit, overconsumption, of, fruit, juices, may, reduce, nutrient, intake, compared, to, eating, whole, fruits, and, may, produce, diarrhea, gas, abdominal, pain, bloating, or, tooth, decay, overconsumption, of, fruits, and, fruit, juice, may, contribute, to, dental, decay, and, cavities, via, the, effect, of, fruit, acids, on, tooth, enamel, longitudinal, prospective, cohort, studies, showed, a, significantly, increased, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, when, juices, with, added, sugars, were, consumed, compared, to, eating, whole, fruits, a, 2014, review, found, that, a, higher, intake, of, sugar, sweetened, fruit, juice, was, significantly, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, overconsumption, of, fruit, juice, with, added, sugars, has, also, been, linked, to, childhood, obesity, the, american, journal, of, public, health, proposed, that, the, healthy, hunger, free, kids, act, of, 2010, in, the, united, states, eliminate, 100, fruit, juices, and, substitute, them, instead, with, whole, fruits, a, juice, bar, is, an, establishment, that, primarily, serves, prepared, juice, beverages, such, as, freshly, squeezed, or, extracted, fruit, juices, juice, blends, fruit, smoothies, a, thick, fruit, drink, often, iced, or, other, juices, such, as, fresh, wheatgrass, juice, sometimes, other, solid, ingredients, or, nutritional, supplements, may, be, added, as, boosters, such, as, fresh, bananas, nuts, or, nut, butter, bodybuilding, supplements, soy, protein, powder, or, others, such, as, whey, or, hemp, protein, powders, wheat, germ, spirulina, or, chlorella, also, if, less, juice, is, used, with, these, same, ingredients, drinks, called, health, shakes, may, be, produced, juice, bars, share, some, of, the, characteristics, of, a, coffeehouse, a, soda, fountain, a, caf, and, a, snack, bar, such, as, providing, blended, drinks, and, food, such, as, sandwiches, juice, bars, may, be, standalone, businesses, in, cities, or, located, at, gyms, along, commuter, areas, near, lunchtime, areas, at, beaches, or, at, tourist, attractions, in, mexico, juice, bars, have, become, more, popular, in, the, 2000s, mexican, juice, bars, often, also, sell, healthy, beverages, and, snacks, the, use, of, the, word, juice, to, mean, liquor, alcohol, dates, from, 1828, the, use, of, the, term, juice, to, mean, electricity, dates, from, 1896, as, a, verb, the, word, juice, was, first, recorded, as, meaning, to, enliven, in, 1964, the, adjective, juiced, is, recorded, as, meaning, drunk, in, 1946, and, enhanced, or, as, if, enhanced, by, steroids, in, 2003, the, adjective, juicy, has, meant, succulent, since, the, 15th, century, e, g, a, juicy, roast, beef, the, figurative, meaning, wealthy, full, of, some, desired,
