entertainment, is, a, form, of, activity, that, holds, the, attention, and, interest, of, an, audience, or, gives, pleasure, and, delight, it, can, be, an, idea, or, a, task, but, it, is, more, likely, to, be, one, of, the, activities, or, events, that, have, developed, over, thousands, of, years, specifically, for, the, purpose, of, keeping, an, audience, s, attention, although, people, s, attention, is, held, by, different, things, because, individuals, have, different, preferences, most, forms, of, entertainment, are, recognisable, and, familiar, storytelling, music, drama, dance, and, different, kinds, of, performance, exist, in, all, cultures, were, supported, in, royal, courts, and, developed, into, sophisticated, forms, over, time, becoming, available, to, all, citizens, the, process, has, been, accelerated, in, modern, times, by, an, entertainment, industry, that, records, and, sells, entertainment, products, entertainment, evolves, and, can, be, adapted, to, suit, any, scale, ranging, from, an, individual, who, chooses, private, entertainment, from, a, now, enormous, array, of, pre, recorded, products, to, a, banquet, adapted, for, two, to, any, size, or, type, of, party, with, appropriate, music, and, dance, to, performances, intended, for, thousands, and, even, for, a, global, audience, the, experience, of, being, entertained, has, come, to, be, strongly, associated, with, amusement, so, that, one, common, understanding, of, the, idea, is, fun, and, laughter, although, many, entertainments, have, a, serious, purpose, this, may, be, the, case, in, various, forms, of, ceremony, celebration, religious, festival, or, satire, for, example, hence, there, is, the, possibility, that, what, appears, to, be, entertainment, may, also, be, a, means, of, achieving, insight, or, intellectual, growth, an, important, aspect, of, entertainment, is, the, audience, which, turns, a, private, recreation, or, leisure, activity, into, entertainment, the, audience, may, have, a, passive, role, as, in, the, case, of, people, watching, a, play, opera, television, show, or, film, or, the, audience, role, may, be, active, as, in, the, case, of, games, where, the, participant, and, audience, roles, may, be, routinely, reversed, entertainment, can, be, public, or, private, involving, formal, scripted, performances, as, in, the, case, of, theatre, or, concerts, or, unscripted, and, spontaneous, as, in, the, case, of, children, s, games, most, forms, of, entertainment, have, persisted, over, many, centuries, evolving, due, to, changes, in, culture, technology, and, fashion, as, with, stage, magic, films, and, video, games, although, they, use, newer, media, continue, to, tell, stories, present, drama, and, play, music, festivals, devoted, to, music, film, or, dance, allow, audiences, to, be, entertained, over, a, number, of, consecutive, days, some, entertainment, such, as, public, executions, is, now, illegal, in, most, countries, activities, such, as, fencing, or, archery, once, used, in, hunting, or, war, have, become, spectator, sports, in, the, same, way, other, activities, such, as, cooking, have, developed, into, performances, among, professionals, staged, as, global, competitions, and, then, broadcast, for, entertainment, what, is, entertainment, for, one, group, or, individual, may, be, regarded, as, work, or, an, act, of, cruelty, by, another, the, familiar, forms, of, entertainment, have, the, capacity, to, cross, over, into, different, media, and, have, demonstrated, a, seemingly, unlimited, potential, for, creative, remix, this, has, ensured, the, continuity, and, longevity, of, many, themes, images, and, structures, the, oxford, english, dictionary, gives, latin, and, french, origins, for, the, word, entertain, including, inter, among, tenir, to, hold, as, derivations, giving, translations, of, to, hold, mutually, or, to, hold, intertwined, and, to, engage, keep, occupied, the, attention, thoughts, or, time, of, a, person, it, also, provides, words, like, merry, making, pleasure, and, delight, as, well, as, to, receive, as, a, guest, and, show, hospitality, to, it, cites, a, 1490, usage, by, william, caxton, entertainment, can, be, distinguished, from, other, activities, such, as, education, and, marketing, even, though, they, have, learned, how, to, use, the, appeal, of, entertainment, to, achieve, their, different, goals, sometimes, entertainment, can, be, a, mixture, for, both, the, importance, and, impact, of, entertainment, is, recognised, by, scholars, and, its, increasing, sophistication, has, influenced, practices, in, other, fields, such, as, museology, psychologists, say, the, function, of, media, entertainment, is, the, attainment, of, gratification, no, other, results, or, measurable, benefits, are, usually, expected, from, it, except, perhaps, the, final, score, in, a, sporting, entertainment, this, is, in, contrast, to, education, which, is, designed, with, the, purpose, of, developing, understanding, or, helping, people, to, learn, and, marketing, which, aims, to, encourage, people, to, purchase, commercial, products, however, the, distinctions, become, blurred, when, education, seeks, to, be, more, entertaining, and, entertainment, or, marketing, seek, to, be, more, educational, such, mixtures, are, often, known, by, the, neologisms, edutainment, or, infotainment, the, psychology, of, entertainment, as, well, as, of, learning, has, been, applied, to, all, these, fields, some, education, entertainment, is, a, serious, attempt, to, combine, the, best, features, of, the, two, some, people, are, entertained, by, others, pain, or, the, idea, of, their, unhappiness, schadenfreude, an, entertainment, might, go, beyond, gratification, and, produce, some, insight, in, its, audience, entertainment, may, skilfully, consider, universal, philosophical, questions, such, as, what, does, it, mean, to, be, human, what, is, the, right, thing, to, do, or, how, do, i, know, what, i, know, the, meaning, of, life, for, example, is, the, subject, in, a, wide, range, of, entertainment, forms, including, film, music, and, literature, questions, such, as, these, drive, many, narratives, and, dramas, whether, they, are, presented, in, the, form, of, a, story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or, game, dramatic, examples, include, shakespeare, s, influential, play, hamlet, whose, hero, articulates, these, concerns, in, poetry, and, films, such, as, the, matrix, which, explores, the, nature, of, knowledge, and, was, released, worldwide, novels, give, great, scope, for, investigating, these, themes, while, they, entertain, their, readers, an, example, of, a, creative, work, that, considers, philosophical, questions, so, entertainingly, that, it, has, been, presented, in, a, very, wide, range, of, forms, is, the, hitchhiker, s, guide, to, the, galaxy, originally, a, radio, comedy, this, story, became, so, popular, that, it, has, also, appeared, as, a, novel, film, television, series, stage, show, comic, audiobook, lp, record, adventure, game, and, online, game, its, ideas, became, popular, references, see, phrases, from, the, hitchhiker, s, guide, to, the, galaxy, and, has, been, translated, into, many, languages, its, themes, encompass, the, meaning, of, life, as, well, as, the, ethics, of, entertainment, artificial, intelligence, multiple, worlds, god, and, philosophical, method, the, ancient, craft, of, communicating, events, and, experiences, using, words, images, sounds, and, gestures, by, telling, a, story, is, not, only, the, means, by, which, people, passed, on, their, cultural, values, and, traditions, and, history, from, one, generation, to, another, it, has, been, an, important, part, of, most, forms, of, entertainment, ever, since, the, earliest, times, stories, are, still, told, in, the, early, forms, for, example, around, a, fire, while, camping, or, when, listening, to, the, stories, of, another, culture, as, a, tourist, the, earliest, storytelling, sequences, we, possess, now, of, course, committed, to, writing, were, undoubtedly, originally, a, speaking, from, mouth, to, ear, and, their, force, as, entertainment, derived, from, the, very, same, elements, we, today, enjoy, in, films, and, novels, storytelling, is, an, activity, that, has, evolved, and, developed, toward, variety, many, entertainments, including, storytelling, but, especially, music, and, drama, remain, familiar, but, have, developed, into, a, wide, variety, of, form, to, suit, a, very, wide, range, of, personal, preferences, and, cultural, expression, many, types, are, blended, or, supported, by, other, forms, for, example, drama, stories, and, banqueting, or, dining, are, commonly, enhanced, by, music, sport, and, games, are, incorporated, into, other, activities, to, increase, appeal, some, may, have, evolved, from, serious, or, necessary, activities, such, as, running, and, jumping, into, competition, and, then, become, entertainment, it, is, said, for, example, that, pole, vaulting, may, have, originated, in, the, netherlands, where, people, used, long, poles, to, vault, over, wide, canals, rather, than, wear, out, their, clogs, walking, miles, to, the, nearest, bridge, others, maintain, that, pole, vaulting, was, used, in, warfare, to, vault, over, fortress, walls, during, battle, the, equipment, for, such, sports, has, become, increasingly, sophisticated, vaulting, poles, for, example, were, originally, made, from, woods, such, as, ash, hickory, or, hazel, in, the, 19th, century, bamboo, was, used, and, in, the, 21st, century, poles, can, be, made, of, carbon, fibre, other, activities, such, as, walking, on, stilts, are, still, seen, in, circus, performances, in, the, 21st, century, gladiatorial, combats, also, known, as, gladiatorial, games, popular, during, roman, times, provide, a, good, example, of, an, activity, that, is, a, combination, of, sport, punishment, and, entertainment, changes, to, what, is, regarded, as, entertainment, can, occur, in, response, to, cultural, or, historical, shifts, hunting, wild, animals, for, example, was, introduced, into, the, roman, empire, from, carthage, and, became, a, popular, public, entertainment, and, spectacle, supporting, an, international, trade, in, wild, animals, entertainment, also, evolved, into, different, forms, and, expressions, as, a, result, of, social, upheavals, such, as, wars, and, revolutions, during, the, chinese, cultural, revolution, for, example, revolutionary, opera, was, sanctioned, by, the, communist, party, and, world, war, i, the, great, depression, and, the, russian, revolution, all, affected, entertainment, relatively, minor, changes, to, the, form, and, venue, of, an, entertainment, continue, to, come, and, go, as, they, are, affected, by, the, period, fashion, culture, technology, and, economics, for, example, a, story, told, in, dramatic, form, can, be, presented, in, an, open, air, theatre, a, music, hall, a, cinema, a, multiplex, or, as, technological, possibilities, advanced, via, a, personal, electronic, device, such, as, a, tablet, computer, entertainment, is, provided, for, mass, audiences, in, purpose, built, structures, such, as, a, theatre, auditorium, or, stadium, one, of, the, most, famous, venues, in, the, western, world, the, colosseum, dedicated, ad, 80, with, a, hundred, days, of, games, held, fifty, thousand, spectators, and, in, it, audiences, enjoyed, blood, sport, with, the, trappings, of, stage, shows, spectacles, competitions, races, and, sports, were, once, presented, in, this, purpose, built, arena, as, public, entertainment, new, stadia, continue, to, be, built, to, suit, the, ever, more, sophisticated, requirements, of, global, audiences, imperial, and, royal, courts, have, provided, training, grounds, and, support, for, professional, entertainers, with, different, cultures, using, palaces, castles, and, forts, in, different, ways, in, the, maya, city, states, for, example, spectacles, often, took, place, in, large, plazas, in, front, of, palaces, the, crowds, gathered, either, there, or, in, designated, places, from, which, they, could, watch, at, a, distance, court, entertainments, also, crossed, cultures, for, example, the, durbar, was, introduced, to, india, by, the, mughals, and, passed, onto, the, british, empire, which, then, followed, indian, tradition, institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies, by, which, a, maharaja, or, nawab, were, installed, the, exchange, of, official, presents, the, order, of, precedence, for, example, were, all, inherited, from, the, emperors, of, delhi, in, korea, the, court, entertainment, dance, was, originally, performed, in, the, palace, for, entertainment, at, court, banquets, court, entertainment, often, moved, from, being, associated, with, the, court, to, more, general, use, among, commoners, this, was, the, case, with, masked, dance, dramas, in, korea, which, originated, in, conjunction, with, village, shaman, rituals, and, eventually, became, largely, an, entertainment, form, for, commoners, nautch, dancers, in, the, mughal, empire, performed, in, indian, courts, and, palaces, another, evolution, similar, to, that, from, courtly, entertainment, to, common, practice, was, the, transition, from, religious, ritual, to, secular, entertainment, such, as, happened, during, the, goryeo, dynasty, with, the, narye, festival, originally, solely, religious, or, ritualistic, a, secular, component, was, added, at, the, conclusion, former, courtly, entertainments, such, as, jousting, often, also, survived, in, children, s, games, in, some, courts, such, as, those, during, the, byzantine, empire, the, genders, were, segregated, among, the, upper, classes, so, that, at, least, before, the, period, of, the, komnenoi, 1081, 1185, men, were, separated, from, women, at, ceremonies, where, there, was, entertainment, such, as, receptions, and, banquets, court, ceremonies, palace, banquets, and, the, spectacles, associated, with, them, have, been, used, not, only, to, entertain, but, also, to, demonstrate, wealth, and, power, such, events, reinforce, the, relationship, between, ruler, and, ruled, between, those, with, power, and, those, without, serving, to, dramatise, the, differences, between, ordinary, families, and, that, of, the, ruler, this, is, the, case, as, much, as, for, traditional, courts, as, it, is, for, contemporary, ceremonials, such, as, the, hong, kong, handover, ceremony, in, 1997, at, which, an, array, of, entertainments, including, a, banquet, a, parade, fireworks, a, festival, performance, and, an, art, spectacle, were, put, to, the, service, of, highlighting, a, change, in, political, power, court, entertainments, were, typically, performed, for, royalty, and, courtiers, as, well, as, for, the, pleasure, of, local, and, visiting, dignitaries, royal, courts, such, as, the, korean, one, also, supported, traditional, dances, in, sudan, musical, instruments, such, as, the, so, called, slit, or, talking, drums, once, part, of, the, court, orchestra, of, a, powerful, chief, had, multiple, purposes, they, were, used, to, make, music, speak, at, ceremonies, mark, community, events, send, long, distance, messages, and, call, men, to, hunt, or, war, courtly, entertainments, also, demonstrate, the, complex, relationship, between, entertainer, and, spectator, individuals, may, be, either, an, entertainer, or, part, of, the, audience, or, they, may, swap, roles, even, during, the, course, of, one, entertainment, in, the, court, at, the, palace, of, versailles, thousands, of, courtiers, including, men, and, women, who, inhabited, its, apartments, acted, as, both, performers, and, spectators, in, daily, rituals, that, reinforced, the, status, hierarchy, like, court, entertainment, royal, occasions, such, as, coronations, and, weddings, provided, opportunities, to, entertain, both, the, aristocracy, and, the, people, for, example, the, splendid, 1595, accession, day, celebrations, of, queen, elizabeth, i, offered, tournaments, and, jousting, and, other, events, performed, not, only, before, the, assembled, court, in, all, their, finery, but, also, before, thousands, of, londoners, eager, for, a, good, day, s, entertainment, entry, for, the, day, s, events, at, the, tiltyard, in, whitehall, was, set, at, 12d, although, most, forms, of, entertainment, have, evolved, and, continued, over, time, some, once, popular, forms, are, no, longer, as, acceptable, for, example, during, earlier, centuries, in, europe, watching, or, participating, in, the, punishment, of, criminals, or, social, outcasts, was, an, accepted, and, popular, form, of, entertainment, many, forms, of, public, humiliation, also, offered, local, entertainment, in, the, past, even, capital, punishment, such, as, hanging, and, beheading, offered, to, the, public, as, a, warning, were, also, regarded, partly, as, entertainment, capital, punishments, that, lasted, longer, such, as, stoning, and, drawing, and, quartering, afforded, a, greater, public, spectacle, a, hanging, was, a, carnival, that, diverted, not, merely, the, unemployed, but, the, unemployable, good, bourgeois, or, curious, aristocrats, who, could, afford, it, watched, it, from, a, carriage, or, rented, a, room, public, punishment, as, entertainment, lasted, until, the, 19th, century, by, which, time, the, awesome, event, of, a, public, hanging, aroused, the, loathing, of, writers, and, philosophers, both, dickens, and, thackeray, wrote, about, a, hanging, in, newgate, prison, in, 1840, and, taught, an, even, wider, public, that, executions, are, obscene, entertainments, children, s, entertainment, is, centred, on, play, and, is, significant, for, their, growth, it, often, mimics, adult, activities, such, as, watching, performances, on, television, prepares, them, for, adult, responsibilities, such, as, child, rearing, or, social, interaction, through, dolls, pets, and, group, games, or, develops, skills, such, as, motor, skills, such, as, a, game, of, marbles, needed, for, sports, and, music, in, the, modern, day, it, often, involves, sedentary, engagement, with, television, or, tablet, computer, entertainment, is, also, provided, to, children, or, taught, to, them, by, adults, a, children, s, entertainer, or, performer, is, a, professional, whose, job, it, is, to, entertain, children, the, term, can, be, used, to, describe, a, children, s, musician, or, television, presenter, but, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, specializations, including, magicians, costumed, performers, puppeteers, and, party, princesses, many, activities, that, appeal, to, children, such, as, puppets, clowns, pantomimes, and, cartoons, are, also, enjoyed, by, adults, children, have, always, played, games, it, is, accepted, that, as, well, as, being, entertaining, playing, games, helps, children, s, development, one, of, the, most, famous, visual, accounts, of, children, s, games, is, a, painting, by, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, called, children, s, games, painted, in, 1560, it, depicts, children, playing, a, range, of, games, that, presumably, were, typical, of, the, time, many, of, these, games, such, as, marbles, hide, and, seek, blowing, soap, bubbles, and, piggyback, riding, continue, to, be, played, most, forms, of, entertainment, can, be, or, are, modified, to, suit, children, s, needs, and, interests, during, the, 20th, century, starting, with, the, often, criticised, but, nonetheless, important, work, of, g, stanley, hall, who, promoted, the, link, between, the, study, of, development, and, the, new, laboratory, psychology, and, especially, with, the, work, of, jean, piaget, who, saw, cognitive, development, as, being, analogous, to, biological, development, it, became, understood, that, the, psychological, development, of, children, occurs, in, stages, and, that, their, capacities, differ, from, adults, hence, stories, and, activities, whether, in, books, film, or, video, games, were, developed, specifically, for, child, audiences, countries, have, responded, to, the, special, needs, of, children, and, the, rise, of, digital, entertainment, by, developing, systems, such, as, television, content, rating, systems, to, guide, the, public, and, the, entertainment, industry, in, the, 21st, century, as, with, adult, products, much, entertainment, is, available, for, children, on, the, internet, for, private, use, this, constitutes, a, significant, change, from, earlier, times, the, amount, of, time, expended, by, children, indoors, on, screen, based, entertainment, and, the, remarkable, collapse, of, children, s, engagement, with, nature, has, drawn, criticism, for, its, negative, effects, on, imagination, adult, cognition, and, psychological, well, being, banquets, have, been, a, venue, for, amusement, entertainment, or, pleasure, since, ancient, times, continuing, into, the, modern, era, until, the, 21st, century, when, they, are, still, being, used, for, many, of, their, original, purposes, to, impress, visitors, especially, important, ones, to, show, hospitality, as, an, occasion, to, showcase, supporting, entertainments, such, as, music, or, dancing, or, both, they, were, an, integral, part, of, court, entertainments, and, helped, entertainers, develop, their, skills, they, are, also, important, components, of, celebrations,

into, dramatic, film, or, theatre, productions, music, is, also, a, universal, and, popular, type, of, entertainment, on, its, own, constituting, an, entire, performance, such, as, when, concerts,

themselves, were, then, delectable, but, when, we, happen, to, put, our, thoughts, in, writing, how, easily, later, on, does, our, mind, race, through, an, infinity, of, events, incessantly, alive, so, that, a, long, time, afterwards, when, we, take, up, those, written, pages, we, can, return, to, the, same, place, and, to, the, same, disposition, in, which, we, once, found, ourselves, quote, from, and, commentary, by, fischer, 2003, the, young, saint, teresa, of, vila, 1515, 1582, read, chivalrous, novels, and, wrote, about, the, rapture, that, books, provided, i, became, accustomed, to, reading, and, that, small, fault, made, me, cool, my, desire, and, will, to, do, other, tasks, i, thought, nothing, of, spending, many, hours, a, day, and, night, in, this, vain, exercise, hidden, from, my, father, my, rapture, in, this, was, so, great, that, unless, i, had, a, new, book, to, read, it, seemed, to, me, that, i, could, not, be, happy, quoted, in, fischer, 2003, reading, has, been, a, source, of, entertainment, for, a, very, long, time, especially, when, other, forms, such, as, performance, entertainments, were, or, are, either, unavailable, or, too, costly, even, when, the, primary, purpose, of, the, writing, is, to, inform, or, instruct, reading, is, well, known, for, its, capacity, to, distract, from, everyday, worries, both, stories, and, information, have, been, passed, on, through, the, tradition, of, orality, and, oral, traditions, survive, in, the, form, of, performance, poetry, for, example, however, they, have, drastically, declined, once, literacy, had, arrived, in, strength, there, was, no, return, to, the, oral, prerogative, the, advent, of, printing, the, reduction, in, costs, of, books, and, an, increasing, literacy, all, served, to, enhance, the, mass, appeal, of, reading, furthermore, as, fonts, were, standardised, and, texts, became, clearer, reading, ceased, being, a, painful, process, of, decipherment, and, became, an, act, of, pure, pleasure, by, the, 16th, century, in, europe, the, appeal, of, reading, for, entertainment, was, well, established, among, literature, s, many, genres, are, some, designed, in, whole, or, in, part, purely, for, entertainment, limericks, for, example, use, verse, in, a, strict, predictable, rhyme, and, rhythm, to, create, humour, and, to, amuse, an, audience, of, listeners, or, readers, interactive, books, such, as, choose, your, own, adventure, can, make, literary, entertainment, more, participatory, comics, and, editorial, cartoons, are, literary, genres, that, use, drawings, or, graphics, usually, in, combination, with, text, to, convey, an, entertaining, narrative, many, contemporary, comics, have, elements, of, fantasy, and, are, produced, by, companies, that, are, part, of, the, entertainment, industry, others, have, unique, authors, who, offer, a, more, personal, philosophical, view, of, the, world, and, the, problems, people, face, comics, about, superheroes, such, as, superman, are, of, the, first, type, examples, of, the, second, sort, include, the, individual, work, over, 50, years, of, charles, m, schulz, who, produced, a, popular, comic, called, peanuts, about, the, relationships, among, a, cast, of, child, characters, and, michael, leunig, who, entertains, by, producing, whimsical, cartoons, that, also, incorporate, social, criticism, the, japanese, manga, style, differs, from, the, western, approach, in, that, it, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, genres, and, themes, for, a, readership, of, all, ages, caricature, uses, a, kind, of, graphic, entertainment, for, purposes, ranging, from, merely, putting, a, smile, on, the, viewer, s, face, to, raising, social, awareness, to, highlighting, the, moral, characteristics, of, a, person, being, caricatured, comedy, is, both, a, genre, of, entertainment, and, a, component, of, it, providing, laughter, and, amusement, whether, the, comedy, is, the, sole, purpose, or, used, as, a, form, of, contrast, in, an, otherwise, serious, piece, it, is, a, valued, contributor, to, many, forms, of, entertainment, including, in, literature, theatre, opera, film, and, games, in, royal, courts, such, as, in, the, byzantine, court, and, presumably, also, in, its, wealthy, households, mimes, were, the, focus, of, orchestrated, humour, expected, or, obliged, to, make, fun, of, all, at, court, not, even, excepting, the, emperor, and, members, of, the, imperial, family, this, highly, structured, role, of, jester, consisted, of, verbal, humour, including, teasing, jests, insult, ridicule, and, obscenity, and, non, verbal, humour, such, as, slapstick, and, horseplay, in, the, presence, of, an, audience, in, medieval, times, all, comic, types, the, buffoon, jester, hunchback, dwarf, jokester, were, all, considered, to, be, essentially, of, one, comic, type, the, fool, who, while, not, necessarily, funny, represented, the, shortcomings, of, the, individual, shakespeare, wrote, seventeen, comedies, that, incorporate, many, techniques, still, used, by, performers, and, writers, of, comedy, such, as, jokes, puns, parody, wit, observational, humour, or, the, unexpected, effect, of, irony, one, liner, jokes, and, satire, are, also, used, to, comedic, effect, in, literature, in, farce, the, comedy, is, a, primary, purpose, the, meaning, of, the, word, comedy, and, the, audience, s, expectations, of, it, have, changed, over, time, and, vary, according, to, culture, simple, physical, comedy, such, as, slapstick, is, entertaining, to, a, broad, range, of, people, of, all, ages, however, as, cultures, become, more, sophisticated, national, nuances, appear, in, the, style, and, references, so, that, what, is, amusing, in, one, culture, may, be, unintelligible, in, another, live, performances, before, an, audience, constitute, a, major, form, of, entertainment, especially, before, the, invention, of, audio, and, video, recording, performance, takes, a, wide, range, of, forms, including, theatre, music, and, drama, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, european, royal, courts, presented, masques, that, were, complex, theatrical, entertainments, involving, dancing, singing, and, acting, opera, is, a, similarly, demanding, performance, style, that, remains, popular, it, also, encompass, all, three, forms, demanding, a, high, level, of, musical, and, dramatic, skill, collaboration, and, like, the, masque, production, expertise, as, well, audiences, generally, show, their, appreciation, of, an, entertaining, performance, with, applause, however, all, performers, run, the, risk, of, failing, to, hold, their, audience, s, attention, and, thus, failing, to, entertain, audience, dissatisfaction, is, often, brutally, honest, and, direct, of, course, you, all, ought, to, know, that, while, singing, a, good, song, or, or, giving, a, good, recitation, helps, to, arrest, the, company, s, attention, such, at, least, was, the, case, with, me, the, publican, devised, a, plan, to, bring, my, entertainment, to, an, end, abruptly, and, the, plan, was, he, told, the, waiter, to, throw, a, wet, towel, at, me, which, of, course, the, waiter, did, and, i, received, the, wet, towel, full, force, in, the, face, which, staggered, me, and, had, the, desired, effect, of, putting, an, end, to, me, giving, any, more, entertainments, in, the, house, storytelling, is, an, ancient, form, of, entertainment, that, has, influenced, almost, all, other, forms, it, is, not, only, entertainment, it, is, also, thinking, through, human, conflicts, and, contradictions, hence, although, stories, may, be, delivered, directly, to, a, small, listening, audience, they, are, also, presented, as, entertainment, and, used, as, a, component, of, any, piece, that, relies, on, a, narrative, such, as, film, drama, ballet, and, opera, written, stories, have, been, enhanced, by, illustrations, often, to, a, very, high, artistic, standard, for, example, on, illuminated, manuscripts, and, on, ancient, scrolls, such, as, japanese, ones, stories, remain, a, common, way, of, entertaining, a, group, that, is, on, a, journey, showing, how, stories, are, used, to, pass, the, time, and, entertain, an, audience, of, travellers, chaucer, used, pilgrims, in, his, literary, work, the, canterbury, tales, in, the, 14th, century, as, did, wu, cheng, en, in, the, 16th, century, in, journey, to, the, west, even, though, journeys, can, now, be, completed, much, faster, stories, are, still, told, to, passengers, en, route, in, cars, and, aeroplanes, either, orally, or, delivered, by, some, form, of, technology, the, power, of, stories, to, entertain, is, evident, in, one, of, the, most, famous, ones, scheherazade, a, story, in, the, persian, professional, storytelling, tradition, of, a, woman, who, saves, her, own, life, by, telling, stories, the, connections, between, the, different, types, of, entertainment, are, shown, by, the, way, that, stories, like, this, inspire, a, retelling, in, another, medium, such, as, music, film, or, games, for, example, composers, rimsky, korsakov, ravel, and, szymanowski, have, each, been, inspired, by, the, scheherazade, story, and, turned, it, into, an, orchestral, work, director, pasolini, made, a, film, adaptation, and, there, is, an, innovative, video, game, based, on, the, tale, stories, may, be, told, wordlessly, in, music, dance, or, puppetry, for, example, such, as, in, the, javanese, tradition, of, wayang, in, which, the, performance, is, accompanied, by, a, gamelan, orchestra, or, the, similarly, traditional, punch, and, judy, show, epic, narratives, poems, sagas, and, allegories, from, all, cultures, tell, such, gripping, tales, that, they, have, inspired, countless, other, stories, in, all, forms, of, entertainment, examples, include, the, hindu, ramayana, and, mahabharata, homer, s, odyssey, and, iliad, the, first, arabic, novel, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, the, persian, epic, shahnameh, the, sagas, of, icelanders, and, the, celebrated, tale, of, the, genji, collections, of, stories, such, as, grimms, fairy, tales, or, those, by, hans, christian, andersen, have, been, similarly, influential, originally, published, in, the, early, 19th, century, this, collection, of, folk, stories, significantly, influence, modern, popular, culture, which, subsequently, used, its, themes, images, symbols, and, structural, elements, to, create, new, entertainment, forms, some, of, the, most, powerful, and, long, lasting, stories, are, the, foundation, stories, also, called, origin, or, creation, myths, such, as, the, dreamtime, myths, of, the, australian, aborigines, the, mesopotamian, epic, of, gilgamesh, or, the, hawaiian, stories, of, the, origin, of, the, world, these, too, are, developed, into, books, films, music, and, games, in, a, way, that, increases, their, longevity, and, enhances, their, entertainment, value, theatre, performances, typically, dramatic, or, musical, are, presented, on, a, stage, for, an, audience, and, have, a, history, that, goes, back, to, hellenistic, times, when, leading, musicians, and, actors, performed, widely, at, poetical, competitions, for, example, at, delphi, delos, ephesus, aristotle, and, his, teacher, plato, both, wrote, on, the, theory, and, purpose, of, theatre, aristotle, posed, questions, such, as, what, is, the, function, of, the, arts, in, shaping, character, should, a, member, of, the, ruling, class, merely, watch, performances, or, be, a, participant, and, perform, what, kind, of, entertainment, should, be, provided, for, those, who, do, not, belong, to, the, elite, the, ptolemys, in, egypt, the, seleucids, in, pergamum, also, had, a, strong, theatrical, tradition, and, later, wealthy, patrons, in, rome, staged, far, more, lavish, productions, expectations, about, the, performance, and, their, engagement, with, it, have, changed, over, time, for, example, in, england, during, the, 18th, century, the, prejudice, against, actresses, had, faded, and, in, europe, generally, going, to, the, theatre, once, a, socially, dubious, activity, became, a, more, respectable, middle, class, pastime, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, when, the, variety, of, popular, entertainments, increased, operetta, and, music, halls, became, available, and, new, drama, theatres, such, as, the, moscow, art, theatre, and, the, suvorin, theatre, in, russia, opened, at, the, same, time, commercial, newspapers, began, to, carry, theatre, columns, and, reviews, that, helped, make, theatre, a, legitimate, subject, of, intellectual, debate, in, general, discussions, about, art, and, culture, audiences, began, to, gather, to, appreciate, creative, achievement, to, marvel, at, and, be, entertained, by, the, prominent, stars, vaudeville, and, music, halls, popular, at, this, time, in, the, united, states, england, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, were, themselves, eventually, superseded, plays, musicals, monologues, pantomimes, and, performance, poetry, are, part, of, the, very, long, history, of, theatre, which, is, also, the, venue, for, the, type, of, performance, known, as, comedy, in, the, 20th, century, radio, and, television, often, broadcast, live, extended, the, theatrical, tradition, that, continued, to, exist, alongside, the, new, forms, the, stage, and, the, spaces, set, out, in, front, of, it, for, an, audience, create, a, theatre, all, types, of, stage, are, used, with, all, types, of, seating, for, the, audience, including, the, impromptu, or, improvised, the, temporary, the, elaborate, or, the, traditional, and, permanent, they, are, erected, indoors, or, outdoors, the, skill, of, managing, organising, and, preparing, the, stage, for, a, performance, is, known, as, stagecraft, the, audience, s, experience, of, the, entertainment, is, affected, by, their, expectations, the, stagecraft, the, type, of, stage, and, the, type, and, standard, of, seating, provided, films, are, a, major, form, of, entertainment, although, not, all, films, have, entertainment, as, their, primary, purpose, documentary, film, for, example, aims, to, create, a, record, or, inform, although, the, two, purposes, often, work, together, the, medium, was, a, global, business, from, the, beginning, the, lumi, re, brothers, were, the, first, to, send, cameramen, throughout, the, world, instructing, them, to, film, everything, which, could, be, of, interest, for, the, public, in, 1908, path, launched, and, distributed, newsreels, and, by, world, war, i, films, were, meeting, an, enormous, need, for, mass, entertainment, in, the, first, decade, of, the, century, cinematic, programmes, combined, at, random, fictions, and, newsfilms, the, americans, first, contrived, a, way, of, producing, an, illusion, of, motion, through, successive, images, but, the, french, were, able, to, transform, a, scientific, principle, into, a, commercially, lucrative, spectacle, film, therefore, became, a, part, of, the, entertainment, industry, from, its, early, days, increasingly, sophisticated, techniques, have, been, used, in, the, film, medium, to, delight, and, entertain, audiences, animation, for, example, which, involves, the, display, of, rapid, movement, in, an, art, work, is, one, of, these, techniques, that, particularly, appeals, to, younger, audiences, the, advent, of, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, in, the, 21st, century, made, it, possible, to, do, spectacle, more, cheaply, and, on, a, scale, never, dreamed, of, by, cecil, b, demille, from, the, 1930s, to, 1950s, movies, and, radio, were, the, only, mass, entertainment, but, by, the, second, decade, of, the, 21st, century, technological, changes, economic, decisions, risk, aversion, and, globalisation, reduced, both, the, quality, and, range, of, films, being, produced, sophisticated, visual, effects, and, cgi, techniques, for, example, rather, than, humans, were, used, not, only, to, create, realistic, images, of, people, landscapes, and, events, both, real, and, fantastic, but, also, to, animate, non, living, items, such, as, lego, normally, used, as, entertainment, as, a, game, in, physical, form, creators, of, the, lego, movie, wanted, the, audience, to, believe, they, were, looking, at, actual, lego, bricks, on, a, tabletop, that, were, shot, with, a, real, camera, not, what, we, actually, did, which, was, create, vast, environments, with, digital, bricks, inside, the, computer, the, convergence, of, computers, and, film, has, allowed, entertainment, to, be, presented, in, a, new, way, and, the, technology, has, also, allowed, for, those, with, the, personal, resources, to, screen, films, in, a, home, theatre, recreating, in, a, private, venue, the, quality, and, experience, of, a, public, theatre, this, is, similar, to, the, way, that, the, nobility, in, earlier, times, could, stage, private, musical, performances, or, the, use, of, domestic, theatres, in, large, homes, to, perform, private, plays, in, earlier, centuries, films, also, re, imagine, entertainment, from, other, forms, turning, stories, books, and, plays, for, example, into, new, entertainments, the, story, of, film, a, documentary, about, the, history, of, film, gives, a, survey, of, global, achievements, and, innovations, in, the, medium, as, well, as, changes, in, the, conception, of, film, making, it, demonstrates, that, while, some, films, particularly, those, in, the, hollywood, tradition, that, combines, realism, and, melodramatic, romanticism, are, intended, as, a, form, of, escapism, others, require, a, deeper, engagement, or, more, thoughtful, response, from, their, audiences, for, example, the, award, winning, senegalese, film, xala, takes, government, corruption, as, its, theme, charlie, chaplin, s, film, the, great, dictator, was, a, brave, and, innovative, parody, also, on, a, political, theme, stories, that, are, thousands, of, years, old, such, as, noah, have, been, re, interpreted, in, film, applying, familiar, literary, devices, such, as, allegory, and, personification, with, new, techniques, such, as, cgi, to, explore, big, themes, such, as, human, folly, good, and, evil, courage, and, despair, love, faith, and, death, themes, that, have, been, a, main, stay, of, entertainment, across, all, its, forms, as, in, other, media, excellence, and, achievement, in, films, is, recognised, through, a, range, of, awards, including, ones, from, the, american, academy, of, motion, picture, arts, and, sciences, the, british, academy, of, film, and, television, arts, the, cannes, international, film, festival, in, france, and, the, asia, pacific, screen, awards, the, many, forms, of, dance, provide, entertainment, for, all, age, groups, and, cultures, dance, can, be, serious, in, tone, such, as, when, it, is, used, to, express, a, culture, s, history, or, important, stories, it, may, be, provocative, or, it, may, put, in, the, service, of, comedy, since, it, combines, many, forms, of, entertainment, music, movement, storytelling, theatre, it, provides, a, good, example, of, the, various, ways, that, these, forms, can, be, combined, to, create, entertainment, for, different, purposes, and, audiences, dance, is, a, form, of, cultural, representation, that, involves, not, just, dancers, but, choreographers, audience, members, patrons, and, impresarios, coming, from, all, over, the, globe, and, from, vastly, varied, time, periods, whether, from, africa, asia, or, europe, dance, is, constantly, negotiating, the, realms, of, political, social, spiritual, and, artistic, influence, even, though, dance, traditions, may, be, limited, to, one, cultural, group, they, all, develop, for, example, in, africa, there, are, dahomean, dances, hausa, dances, masai, dances, and, so, forth, ballet, is, an, example, of, a, highly, developed, western, form, of, dance, that, moved, to, the, theatres, from, the, french, court, during, the, time, of, louis, xiv, the, dancers, becoming, professional, theatrical, performers, some, dances, such, as, the, quadrille, a, square, dance, that, emerged, during, the, napoleonic, years, in, france, and, other, country, dances, were, once, popular, at, social, gatherings, like, balls, but, are, now, rarely, performed, on, the, other, hand, many, folk, dances, such, as, scottish, highland, dancing, and, irish, dancing, have, evolved, into, competitions, which, by, adding, to, their, audiences, has, increased, their, entertainment, value, irish, dance, theatre, which, sometimes, features, traditional, irish, steps, and, music, has, developed, into, a, major, dance, form, with, an, international, reputation, since, dance, is, often, associated, with, the, female, body, and, women, s, experiences, female, dancers, who, dance, to, entertain, have, in, some, cases, been, regarded, as, distinct, from, decent, women, because, they, use, their, bodies, to, make, a, living, instead, of, hiding, them, as, much, as, possible, society, s, attitudes, to, female, dancers, depend, on, the, culture, its, history, and, the, entertainment, industry, itself, for, example, while, some, cultures, regard, any, dancing, by, women, as, the, most, shameful, form, of, entertainment, other, cultures, have, established, venues, such, as, strip, clubs, where, deliberately, erotic, or, sexually, provocative, dances, such, as, striptease, are, performed, in, public, by, professional, women, dancers, for, mostly, male, audiences, various, political, regimes, have, sought, to, control, or, ban, dancing, or, specific, types, of, dancing, sometimes, because, of, disapproval, of, the, music, or, clothes, associated, with, it, nationalism, authoritarianism, and, racism, have, played, a, part, in, banning, dances, or, dancing, for, example, during, the, nazi, regime, american, dances, such, as, swing, regarded, as, completely, un, german, had, become, a, public, offense, and, needed, to, be, banned, similarly, in, shanghai, china, in, the, 1930s, dancing, and, nightclubs, had, come, to, symbolise, the, excess, that, plagued, chinese, society, and, officials, wondered, if, other, forms, of, entertainment, such, as, brothels, should, also, be, banned, banning, had, the, effect, of, making, the, dance, craze, even, greater, in, ireland, the, public, dance, hall, act, of, 1935, banned, but, did, not, stop, dancing, at, the, crossroads, and, other, popular, dance, forms, such, as, house, and, barn, dances, in, the, us, various, dances, were, once, banned, either, because, like, burlesque, they, were, suggestive, or, because, like, the, twist, they, were, associated, with, african, americans, african, american, dancers, were, typically, banned, from, performing, in, minstrel, shows, until, after, the, american, civil, war, dances, can, be, performed, solo, in, pairs, in, groups, or, by, massed, performers, they, might, be, improvised, or, highly, choreographed, spontaneous, for, personal, entertainment, such, as, when, children, begin, dancing, for, themselves, a, private, audience, a, paying, audience, a, world, audience, or, an, audience, interested, in, a, particular, dance, genre, they, might, be, a, part, of, a, celebration, such, as, a, wedding, or, new, year, or, a, cultural, ritual, with, a, specific, purpose, such, as, a, dance, by, warriors, like, a, haka, some, dances, such, as, traditional, dance, and, ballet, need, a, very, high, level, of, skill, and, training, others, such, as, the, can, can, require, a, very, high, level, of, energy, and, physical, fitness, entertaining, the, audience, is, a, normal, part, of, dance, but, its, physicality, often, also, produces, joy, for, the, dancers, themselves, animals, have, been, used, for, the, purposes, of, entertainment, for, millennia, they, have, been, hunted, for, entertainment, as, opposed, to, hunted, for, food, displayed, while, they, hunt, for, prey, watched, when, they, compete, with, each, other, and, watched, while, they, perform, a, trained, routine, for, human, amusement, the, romans, for, example, were, entertained, both, by, competitions, involving, wild, animals, and, acts, performed, by, trained, animals, they, watched, as, lions, and, bears, danced, to, the, music, of, pipes, and, cymbals, horses, were, trained, to, kneel, bow, dance, and, prance, acrobats, turning, handsprings, over, wild, lions, and, vaulting, over, wild, leopards, there, were, violent, confrontations, with, wild, beasts, and, performances, over, time, became, more, brutal, and, bloodier, animals, that, perform, trained, routines, or, acts, for, human, entertainment, include, fleas, in, flea, circuses, dolphins, in, dolphinaria, and, monkeys, doing, tricks, for, an, audience, on, behalf, of, the, player, of, a, street, organ, animals, kept, in, zoos, in, ancient, times, were, often, kept, there, for, later, use, in, the, arena, as, entertainment, or, for, their, entertainment, value, as, exotica, many, contests, between, animals, are, now, regarded, as, sports, for, example, horse, racing, is, regarded, as, both, a, sport, and, an, important, source, of, entertainment, its, economic, impact, means, that, it, is, also, considered, a, global, industry, one, in, which, horses, are, carefully, transported, around, the, world, to, compete, in, races, in, australia, the, horse, race, run, on, melbourne, cup, day, is, a, public, holiday, and, the, public, regards, the, race, as, an, important, annual, event, like, horse, racing, camel, racing, requires, human, riders, while, greyhound, racing, does, not, people, find, it, entertaining, to, watch, animals, race, competitively, whether, they, are, trained, like, horses, camels, or, dogs, or, untrained, like, cockroaches, the, use, of, animals, for, entertainment, is, sometimes, controversial, especially, the, hunting, of, wild, animals, some, contests, between, animals, once, popular, entertainment, for, the, public, have, become, illegal, because, of, the, cruelty, involved, among, these, are, blood, sports, such, as, bear, baiting, dog, fighting, and, cockfighting, other, contests, involving, animals, remain, controversial, and, have, both, supporters, and, detractors, for, example, the, conflict, between, opponents, of, pigeon, shooting, who, view, it, as, a, cruel, and, moronic, exercise, in, marksmanship, and, proponents, who, view, it, as, entertainment, has, been, tested, in, a, court, of, law, fox, hunting, which, involves, the, use, of, horses, as, well, as, hounds, and, bullfighting, which, has, a, strong, theatrical, component, are, two, entertainments, that, have, a, long, and, significant, cultural, history, they, both, involve, animals, and, are, variously, regarded, as, sport, entertainment, or, cultural, tradition, among, the, organisations, set, up, to, advocate, for, the, rights, of, animals, are, some, whose, concerns, include, the, use, of, animals, for, entertainment, however, in, many, cases, of, animal, advocacy, groups, versus, organisations, accused, of, animal, abuse, both, sides, have, cultural, claims, a, circus, described, as, one, of, the, most, brazen, of, entertainment, forms, is, a, special, type, of, theatrical, performance, involving, a, variety, of, physical, skills, such, as, acrobatics, and, juggling, and, sometimes, performing, animals, usually, thought, of, as, a, travelling, show, performed, in, a, big, top, circus, was, first, performed, in, permanent, venues, philip, astley, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, the, modern, circus, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, jules, l, otard, is, the, french, performer, credited, with, developing, the, art, of, the, trapeze, considered, synonymous, with, circuses, astley, brought, together, performances, that, were, generally, familiar, in, traditional, british, fairs, at, least, since, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, tumbling, rope, dancing, juggling, animal, tricks, and, so, on, it, has, been, claimed, that, there, is, no, direct, link, between, the, roman, circus, and, the, circus, of, modern, times, between, the, demise, of, the, roman, circus, and, the, foundation, of, astley, s, amphitheatre, in, london, some, 1300, years, later, the, nearest, thing, to, a, circus, ring, was, the, rough, circle, formed, by, the, curious, onlookers, who, gathered, around, the, itinerant, tumbler, or, juggler, on, a, village, green, the, form, of, entertainment, known, as, stage, magic, or, conjuring, and, recognisable, as, performance, is, based, on, traditions, and, texts, of, magical, rites, and, dogmas, that, have, been, a, part, of, most, cultural, traditions, since, ancient, times, references, to, magic, for, example, can, be, found, in, the, bible, in, hermeticism, in, zoroastrianism, in, the, kabbalistic, tradition, in, mysticism, and, in, the, sources, of, freemasonry, stage, magic, is, performed, for, an, audience, in, a, variety, of, media, and, locations, on, stage, on, television, in, the, street, and, live, at, parties, or, events, it, is, often, combined, with, other, forms, of, entertainment, such, as, comedy, or, music, and, showmanship, is, often, an, essential, part, of, magic, performances, performance, magic, relies, on, deception, psychological, manipulation, sleight, of, hand, and, other, forms, of, trickery, to, give, an, audience, the, illusion, that, a, performer, can, achieve, the, impossible, audiences, amazed, at, the, stunt, performances, and, escape, acts, of, harry, houdini, for, example, regarded, him, as, a, magician, fantasy, magicians, have, held, an, important, place, in, literature, for, centuries, offering, entertainment, to, millions, of, readers, famous, wizards, such, as, merlin, in, the, arthurian, legends, have, been, written, about, since, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, while, in, the, 21st, century, the, young, wizard, harry, potter, became, a, global, entertainment, phenomenon, when, the, book, series, about, him, sold, about, 450, million, copies, as, at, june, 2011, making, it, the, best, selling, book, series, in, history, street, entertainment, street, performance, or, busking, are, forms, of, performance, that, have, been, meeting, the, public, s, need, for, entertainment, for, centuries, it, was, an, integral, aspect, of, london, s, life, for, example, when, the, city, in, the, early, 19th, century, was, filled, with, spectacle, and, diversion, minstrels, or, troubadours, are, part, of, the, tradition, the, art, and, practice, of, busking, is, still, celebrated, at, annual, busking, festivals, there, are, three, basic, forms, of, contemporary, street, performance, the, first, form, is, the, circle, show, it, tends, to, gather, a, crowd, usually, has, a, distinct, beginning, and, end, and, is, done, in, conjunction, with, street, theatre, puppeteering, magicians, comedians, acrobats, jugglers, and, sometimes, musicians, this, type, has, the, potential, to, be, the, most, lucrative, for, the, performer, because, there, are, likely, to, be, more, donations, from, larger, audiences, if, they, are, entertained, by, the, act, good, buskers, control, the, crowd, so, patrons, do, not, obstruct, foot, traffic, the, second, form, the, walk, by, act, has, no, distinct, beginning, or, end, typically, the, busker, provides, an, entertaining, ambience, often, with, an, unusual, instrument, and, the, audience, may, not, stop, to, watch, or, form, a, crowd, sometimes, a, walk, by, act, spontaneously, turns, into, a, circle, show, the, third, form, caf, busking, is, performed, mostly, in, restaurants, pubs, bars, and, caf, s, this, type, of, act, occasionally, uses, public, transport, as, a, venue, parades, are, held, for, a, range, of, purposes, often, more, than, one, whether, their, mood, is, sombre, or, festive, being, public, events, that, are, designed, to, attract, attention, and, activities, that, necessarily, divert, normal, traffic, parades, have, a, clear, entertainment, value, to, their, audiences, cavalcades, and, the, modern, variant, the, motorcade, are, examples, of, public, processions, some, people, watching, the, parade, or, procession, may, have, made, a, special, effort, to, attend, while, others, become, part, of, the, audience, by, happenstance, whatever, their, mood, or, primary, purpose, parades, attract, and, entertain, people, who, watch, them, pass, by, occasionally, a, parade, takes, place, in, an, improvised, theatre, space, such, as, the, trooping, the, colour, in, and, tickets, are, sold, to, the, physical, audience, while, the, global, audience, participates, via, broadcast, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, parade, were, triumphs, grand, and, sensational, displays, of, foreign, treasures, and, spoils, given, by, triumphant, roman, generals, to, celebrate, their, victories, they, presented, conquered, peoples, and, nations, that, exalted, the, prestige, of, the, victor, in, the, summer, of, 46, bce, julius, caesar, chose, to, celebrate, four, triumphs, held, on, different, days, extending, for, about, one, month, in, europe, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, baroque, the, royal, entry, celebrated, the, formal, visit, of, the, monarch, to, the, city, with, a, parade, through, elaborately, decorated, streets, passing, various, shows, and, displays, the, annual, lord, mayor, s, show, in, london, is, an, example, of, a, civic, parade, that, has, survived, since, medieval, times, many, religious, festivals, especially, those, that, incorporate, processions, such, as, holy, week, processions, or, the, indian, festival, of, holi, have, some, entertainment, appeal, in, addition, to, their, serious, purpose, sometimes, religious, rituals, have, been, adapted, or, evolved, into, secular, entertainments, or, like, the, festa, del, redentore, in, venice, have, managed, to, grow, in, popularity, while, holding, both, secular, and, sacred, purposes, in, balance, however, pilgrimages, such, as, the, roman, catholic, pilgrimage, of, the, way, of, st, james, the, muslim, hajj, and, the, hindu, kumbh, mela, which, may, appear, to, the, outsider, as, an, entertaining, parade, or, procession, are, not, intended, as, entertainment, they, are, instead, about, an, individual, s, spiritual, journey, hence, the, relationship, between, spectator, and, participant, unlike, entertainments, proper, is, different, the, manner, in, which, the, kumbh, mela, for, example, is, divorced, from, its, cultural, context, and, repackaged, for, western, consumption, renders, the, presence, of, voyeurs, deeply, problematic, parades, generally, impress, and, delight, often, by, including, unusual, colourful, costumes, sometimes, they, also, commemorate, or, celebrate, sometimes, they, have, a, serious, purpose, such, as, when, the, context, is, military, when, the, intention, is, sometimes, to, intimidate, or, religious, when, the, audience, might, participate, or, have, a, role, to, play, even, if, a, parade, uses, new, technology, and, is, some, distance, away, it, is, likely, to, have, a, strong, appeal, draw, the, attention, of, onlookers, and, entertain, them, fireworks, are, a, part, of, many, public, entertainments, and, have, retained, an, enduring, popularity, since, they, became, a, crowning, feature, of, elaborate, celebrations, in, the, 17th, century, first, used, in, china, classical, antiquity, and, europe, for, military, purposes, fireworks, were, most, popular, in, the, 18th, century, and, high, prices, were, paid, for, pyrotechnists, especially, the, skilled, italian, ones, who, were, summoned, to, other, countries, to, organise, displays, fire, and, water, were, important, aspects, of, court, spectacles, because, the, displays, inspired, by, means, of, fire, sudden, noise, smoke, and, general, magnificence, the, sentiments, thought, fitting, for, the, subject, to, entertain, of, his, sovereign, awe, fear, and, a, vicarious, sense, of, glory, in, his, might, birthdays, name, days, weddings, and, anniversaries, provided, the, occasion, for, celebration, one, of, the, most, famous, courtly, uses, of, fireworks, was, one, used, to, celebrate, the, end, of, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, and, while, the, fireworks, themselves, caused, a, fire, the, accompanying, music, for, the, royal, fireworks, written, by, handel, has, been, popular, ever, since, aside, from, their, contribution, to, entertainments, related, to, military, successes, courtly, displays, and, personal, celebrations, fireworks, are, also, used, as, part, of, religious, ceremony, for, example, during, the, indian, dashavatara, kala, of, gomantaka, the, temple, deity, is, taken, around, in, a, procession, with, a, lot, of, singing, dancing, and, display, of, fireworks, the, fire, sudden, noise, and, smoke, of, fireworks, is, still, a, significant, part, of, public, celebration, and, entertainment, for, example, fireworks, were, one, of, the, primary, forms, of, display, chosen, to, celebrate, the, turn, of, the, millennium, around, the, world, as, the, clock, struck, midnight, and, 1999, became, 2000, firework, displays, and, open, air, parties, greeted, the, new, year, as, the, time, zones, changed, over, to, the, next, century, fireworks, carefully, planned, and, choreographed, were, let, off, against, the, backdrop, of, many, of, the, world, s, most, famous, buildings, including, the, sydney, harbour, bridge, the, pyramids, of, giza, in, egypt, the, acropolis, in, athens, red, square, in, moscow, vatican, city, in, rome, the, brandenburg, gate, in, berlin, the, eiffel, tower, in, paris, and, elizabeth, tower, in, london, sporting, competitions, have, always, provided, entertainment, for, crowds, to, distinguish, the, players, from, the, audience, the, latter, are, often, known, as, spectators, developments, in, stadium, and, auditorium, design, as, well, as, in, recording, and, broadcast, technology, have, allowed, off, site, spectators, to, watch, sport, with, the, result, that, the, size, of, the, audience, has, grown, ever, larger, and, spectator, sport, has, become, increasingly, popular, two, of, the, most, popular, sports, with, global, appeal, are, association, football, and, cricket, their, ultimate, international, competitions, the, fifa, world, cup, and, the, cricket, world, cup, are, broadcast, around, the, world, beyond, the, very, large, numbers, involved, in, playing, these, sports, they, are, notable, for, being, a, major, source, of, entertainment, for, many, millions, of, non, players, worldwide, a, comparable, multi, stage, long, form, sport, with, global, appeal, is, the, tour, de, france, unusual, in, that, it, takes, place, outside, of, special, stadia, being, run, instead, in, the, countryside, aside, from, sports, that, have, worldwide, appeal, and, competitions, such, as, the, olympic, games, the, entertainment, value, of, a, sport, depends, on, the, culture, and, country, where, people, play, it, for, example, in, the, united, states, baseball, and, basketball, games, are, popular, forms, of, entertainment, in, bhutan, the, national, sport, is, archery, in, new, zealand, it, is, rugby, union, in, iran, it, is, freestyle, wrestling, japan, s, unique, sumo, wrestling, contains, ritual, elements, that, derive, from, its, long, history, in, some, cases, such, as, the, international, running, group, hash, house, harriers, participants, create, a, blend, of, sport, and, entertainment, for, themselves, largely, independent, of, spectator, involvement, where, the, social, component, is, more, important, than, the, competitive, the, evolution, of, an, activity, into, a, sport, and, then, an, entertainment, is, also, affected, by, the, local, climate, and, conditions, for, example, the, modern, sport, of, surfing, is, associated, with, hawaii, and, that, of, snow, skiing, probably, evolved, in, scandinavia, while, these, sports, and, the, entertainment, they, offer, to, spectators, have, spread, around, the, world, people, in, the, two, originating, countries, remain, well, known, for, their, prowess, sometimes, the, climate, offers, a, chance, to, adapt, another, sport, such, as, in, the, case, of, ice, hockey, an, important, entertainment, in, canada, fairs, and, exhibitions, have, existed, since, ancient, and, medieval, times, displaying, wealth, innovations, and, objects, for, trade, and, offering, specific, entertainments, as, well, as, being, places, of, entertainment, in, themselves, whether, in, a, medieval, market, or, a, small, shop, shopping, always, offered, forms, of, exhilaration, that, took, one, away, from, the, everyday, however, in, the, modern, world, merchandising, has, become, entertainment, spinning, signs, flashing, signs, thumping, music, video, screens, interactive, computer, kiosks, day, care, caf, s, by, the, 19th, century, expos, that, encouraged, arts, manufactures, and, commerce, had, become, international, they, were, not, only, hugely, popular, but, affected, international, ideas, for, example, the, 1878, paris, exposition, facilitated, international, cooperation, about, ideas, innovations, and, standards, from, london, 1851, to, paris, 1900, in, excess, of, 200, million, visitors, had, entered, the, turnstiles, in, london, paris, vienna, philadelphia, chicago, and, a, myriad, of, smaller, shows, around, the, world, since, world, war, ii, well, over, 500, million, visits, have, been, recorded, through, world, expo, turnstiles, as, a, form, of, spectacle, and, entertainment, expositions, influenced, everything, from, architecture, to, patterns, of, globalisation, to, fundamental, matters, of, human, identity, and, in, the, process, established, the, close, relationship, between, fairs, the, rise, of, department, stores, and, art, museums, the, modern, world, of, mass, consumption, and, the, entertainment, industry, some, entertainments, such, as, at, large, festivals, whether, religious, or, secular, concerts, clubs, parties, and, celebrations, involve, big, crowds, from, earliest, times, crowds, at, an, entertainment, have, associated, hazards, and, dangers, especially, when, combined, with, the, recreational, consumption, of, intoxicants, such, as, alcohol, the, ancient, greeks, had, dionysian, mysteries, for, example, and, the, romans, had, saturnalia, the, consequence, of, excess, and, crowds, can, produce, breaches, of, social, norms, of, behaviour, sometimes, causing, injury, or, even, death, such, as, for, example, at, the, altamont, free, concert, an, outdoor, rock, festival, the, list, of, serious, incidents, at, nightclubs, includes, those, caused, by, crowd, crush, terrorism, such, as, the, 2002, bali, bombings, that, targeted, a, nightclub, and, especially, fire, investigations, such, as, that, carried, out, in, the, us, after, the, station, nightclub, fire, often, demonstrate, that, lessons, learned, regarding, fire, safety, in, nightclubs, from, earlier, events, such, as, the, cocoanut, grove, fire, do, not, necessarily, result, in, lasting, effective, change, efforts, to, prevent, such, incidents, include, appointing, special, officers, such, as, the, medieval, lord, of, misrule, or, in, modern, times, security, officers, who, control, access, and, also, ongoing, improvement, of, relevant, standards, such, as, those, for, building, safety, the, tourism, industry, now, regards, safety, and, security, at, entertainment, venues, as, an, important, management, task, entertainment, is, big, business, especially, in, the, united, states, but, ubiquitous, in, all, cultures, although, kings, rulers, and, powerful, people, have, always, been, able, to, pay, for, entertainment, to, be, provided, for, them, and, in, many, cases, have, paid, for, public, entertainment, people, generally, have, made, their, own, entertainment, or, when, possible, attended, a, live, performance, technological, developments, in, the, 20th, century, especially, in, the, area, of, mass, media, meant, that, entertainment, could, be, produced, independently, of, the, audience, packaged, and, sold, on, a, commercial, basis, by, an, entertainment, industry, sometimes, referred, to, as, show, business, the, industry, relies, on, business, models, to, produce, market, broadcast, or, otherwise, distribute, many, of, its, traditional, forms, including, performances, of, all, types, the, industry, became, so, sophisticated, that, its, economics, became, a, separate, area, of, academic, study, the, film, industry, is, a, part, of, the, entertainment, industry, components, of, it, include, the, hollywood, and, bollywood, film, industries, as, well, as, the, cinema, of, the, united, kingdom, and, all, the, cinemas, of, europe, including, france, germany, spain, italy, and, others, the, sex, industry, is, another, component, of, the, entertainment, industry, applying, the, same, forms, and, media, for, example, film, books, dance, and, other, performances, to, the, development, marketing, and, sale, of, sex, products, on, a, commercial, basis, amusement, parks, entertain, paying, guests, with, rides, such, as, roller, coasters, ridable, miniature, railways, water, rides, and, dark, rides, as, well, as, other, events, and, associated, attractions, the, parks, are, built, on, a, large, area, subdivided, into, themed, areas, named, lands, sometimes, the, whole, amusement, park, is, based, on, one, theme, such, as, the, various, seaworld, parks, that, focus, on, the, theme, of, sea, life, one, of, the, consequences, of, the, development, of, the, entertainment, industry, has, been, the, creation, of, new, types, of, employment, while, jobs, such, as, writer, musician, and, composer, exist, as, they, always, have, people, doing, this, work, are, likely, to, be, employed, by, a, company, rather, than, a, patron, as, they, once, would, have, been, new, jobs, have, appeared, such, as, gaffer, or, special, effects, supervisor, in, the, film, industry, and, attendants, in, an, amusement, park, prestigious, awards, are, given, by, the, industry, for, excellence, in, the, various, types, of, entertainment, for, example, there, are, awards, for, music, games, including, video, games, comics, theatre, television, film, dance, and, magical, arts, sporting, awards, are, made, for, the, results, and, skill, rather, than, for, the, entertainment, value, purpose, built, structures, as, venues, for, entertainment, that, accommodate, audiences, have, produced, many, famous, and, innovative, buildings, among, the, most, recognisable, of, which, are, theatre, structures, for, the, ancient, greeks, the, architectural, importance, of, the, theatre, is, a, reflection, of, their, importance, to, the, community, made, apparent, in, their, monumentality, in, the, effort, put, into, their, design, and, in, the, care, put, into, their, detail, the, romans, subsequently, developed, the, stadium, in, an, oval, form, known, as, a, circus, in, modern, times, some, of, the, grandest, buildings, for, entertainment, have, brought, fame, to, their, cities, as, well, as, their, designers, the, sydney, opera, house, for, example, is, a, world, heritage, site, and, the, o, in, london, is, an, entertainment, precinct, that, contains, an, indoor, arena, a, music, club, a, cinema, and, exhibition, space, the, bayreuth, festspielhaus, in, germany, is, a, theatre, designed, and, built, for, performances, of, one, specific, musical, composition, two, of, the, chief, architectural, concerns, for, the, design, of, venues, for, mass, audiences, are, speed, of, egress, and, safety, the, speed, at, which, the, venue, empty, is, important, both, for, amenity, and, safety, because, large, crowds, take, a, long, time, to, disperse, from, a, badly, designed, venue, which, creates, a, safety, risk, the, hillsborough, disaster, is, an, example, of, how, poor, aspects, of, building, design, can, contribute, to, audience, deaths, sightlines, and, acoustics, are, also, important, design, considerations, in, most, theatrical, venues, in, the, 21st, century, entertainment, venues, especially, stadia, are, likely, to, figure, among, the, leading, architectural, genres, however, they, require, a, whole, new, approach, to, design, because, they, need, to, be, sophisticated, entertainment, centres, multi, experience, venues, capable, of, being, enjoyed, in, many, diverse, ways, hence, architects, now, have, to, design, with, two, distinct, functions, in, mind, as, sports, and, entertainment, centres, playing, host, to, live, audiences, and, as, sports, and, entertainment, studios, serving, the, viewing, and, listening, requirements, of, the, remote, audience, architects, who, push, the, boundaries, of, design, or, construction, sometimes, create, buildings, that, are, entertaining, because, they, exceed, the, expectations, of, the, public, and, the, client, and, are, aesthetically, outstanding, buildings, such, as, guggenheim, museum, bilbao, designed, by, frank, gehry, are, of, this, type, becoming, a, tourist, attraction, as, well, as, a, significant, international, museum, other, apparently, usable, buildings, are, really, follies, deliberately, constructed, for, a, decorative, purpose, and, never, intended, to, be, practical, on, the, other, hand, sometimes, architecture, is, entertainment, while, pretending, to, be, functional, the, tourism, industry, for, example, creates, or, renovates, buildings, as, attractions, that, have, either, never, been, used, or, can, never, be, used, for, their, ostensible, purpose, they, are, instead, re, purposed, to, entertain, visitors, often, by, simulating, cultural, experiences, buildings, history, and, sacred, spaces, are, thus, made, into, commodities, for, purchase, such, intentional, tourist, attractions, divorce, buildings, from, the, past, so, that, the, difference, between, historical, authenticity, and, contemporary, entertainment, venues, theme, parks, becomes, hard, to, define, examples, include, the, preservation, of, the, alc, zar, of, toledo, with, its, grim, civil, war, history, the, conversion, of, slave, dungeons, into, tourist, attractions, in, ghana, and, the, presentation, of, indigenous, culture, in, libya, the, specially, constructed, buildings, in, amusement, parks, represent, the, park, s, theme, and, are, usually, neither, authentic, nor, completely, functional, by, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, developments, in, electronic, media, made, possible, the, delivery, of, entertainment, products, to, mass, audiences, across, the, globe, the, technology, enabled, people, to, see, hear, and, participate, in, all, the, familiar, forms, stories, theatre, music, dance, wherever, they, live, the, rapid, development, of, entertainment, technology, was, assisted, by, improvements, in, data, storage, devices, such, as, cassette, tapes, or, compact, discs, along, with, increasing, miniaturisation, computerisation, and, the, development, of, barcodes, also, made, ticketing, easier, faster, and, global, in, the, 1940s, radio, was, the, electronic, medium, for, family, entertainment, and, information, in, the, 1950s, it, was, television, that, was, the, new, medium, and, it, rapidly, became, global, bringing, visual, entertainment, first, in, black, and, white, then, in, colour, to, the, world, by, the, 1970s, games, could, be, played, electronically, then, hand, held, devices, provided, mobile, entertainment, and, by, the, last, decade, of, the, 20th, century, via, networked, play, in, combination, with, products, from, the, entertainment, industry, all, the, traditional, forms, of, entertainment, became, available, personally, people, could, not, only, select, an, entertainment, product, such, as, a, piece, of, music, film, or, game, they, could, choose, the, time, and, place, to, use, it, the, proliferation, of, portable, media, players, and, the, emphasis, on, the, computer, as, a, site, for, film, consumption, together, have, significantly, changed, how, audiences, encounter, films, one, of, the, most, notable, consequences, of, the, rise, of, electronic, entertainment, has, been, the, rapid, obsolescence, of, the, various, recording, and, storage, methods, as, an, example, of, speed, of, change, driven, by, electronic, media, over, the, course, of, one, generation, television, as, a, medium, for, receiving, standardised, entertainment, products, went, from, unknown, to, novel, to, ubiquitous, and, finally, to, superseded, one, estimate, was, that, by, 2011, over, 30, per, cent, of, households, in, the, us, would, own, a, wii, console, about, the, same, percentage, that, owned, a, television, in, 1953, some, expected, that, halfway, through, the, second, decade, of, the, 21st, century, online, entertainment, would, have, completely, replaced, television, which, did, not, happen, the, so, called, digital, revolution, has, produced, an, increasingly, transnational, marketplace, that, has, caused, difficulties, for, governments, business, industries, and, individuals, as, they, all, try, to, keep, up, even, the, sports, stadium, of, the, future, will, increasingly, compete, with, television, viewing, in, terms, of, comfort, safety, and, the, constant, flow, of, audio, visual, information, and, entertainment, available, other, flow, on, effects, of, the, shift, are, likely, to, include, those, on, public, architecture, such, as, hospitals, and, nursing, homes, where, television, regarded, as, an, essential, entertainment, service, for, patients, and, residents, will, need, to, be, replaced, by, access, to, the, internet, at, the, same, time, the, ongoing, need, for, entertainers, as, professional, engagers, shows, the, continuity, of, traditional, entertainment, by, the, second, decade, of, the, 21st, century, analogue, recording, was, being, replaced, by, digital, recording, and, all, forms, of, electronic, entertainment, began, to, converge, for, example, convergence, is, challenging, standard, practices, in, the, film, industry, whereas, success, or, failure, used, to, be, determined, by, the, first, weekend, of, its, run, today, a, series, of, exhibition, windows, such, as, dvd, pay, per, view, and, fibre, optic, video, on, demand, are, used, to, maximise, profits, part, of, the, industry, s, adjustment, is, its, release, of, new, commercial, product, directly, via, video, hosting, services, media, convergence, is, said, to, be, more, than, technological, the, convergence, is, cultural, as, well, it, is, also,
