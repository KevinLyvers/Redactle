culture, there, may, be, different, ages, at, which, an, individual, is, considered, to, be, mature, enough, to, be, entrusted, by, society, with, certain, tasks, during, the, european, renaissance, artistic, depictions, of, children, increased, dramatically, which, did, not, have, much, effect, on, the, social, attitude, toward, children, however, the, french, historian, philippe, ari, s, argued, that, during, the, 1600s, the, concept, of, childhood, began, to, emerge, in, europe, however, other, historians, like, nicholas, orme, have, challenged, this, view, and, argued, that, childhood, has, been, seen, as, a, separate, stage, since, at, least, the, medieval, period, adults, saw, children, as, separate, beings, innocent, and, in, need, of, protection, and, training, by, the, adults, around, them, the, english, philosopher, john, locke, was, particularly, influential, in, defining, this, new, attitude, towards, children, especially, with, regard, to, his, theory, of, the, tabula, rasa, which, considered, the, mind, at, birth, to, be, a, blank, slate, a, corollary, of, this, doctrine, was, that, the, mind, of, the, child, was, born, blank, and, that, it, was, the, duty, of, the, parents, to, imbue, the, child, with, correct, notions, during, the, early, period, of, capitalism, the, rise, of, a, large, commercial, middle, class, mainly, in, the, protestant, countries, of, the, dutch, republic, and, england, brought, about, a, new, family, ideology, centred, around, the, upbringing, of, children, puritanism, stressed, the, importance, of, individual, salvation, and, concern, for, the, spiritual, welfare, of, children, the, modern, notion, of, childhood, with, its, own, autonomy, and, goals, began, to, emerge, during, the, 18th, century, enlightenment, and, the, romantic, period, that, followed, it, jean, jacques, rousseau, formulated, the, romantic, attitude, towards, children, in, his, famous, 1762, novel, emile, or, on, education, building, on, the, ideas, of, john, locke, and, other, 17th, century, thinkers, jean, jaques, rousseau, described, childhood, as, a, brief, period, of, sanctuary, before, people, encounter, the, perils, and, hardships, of, adulthood, sir, joshua, reynolds, extensive, children, portraiture, demonstrated, the, new, enlightened, attitudes, toward, young, children, his, 1788, painting, the, age, of, innocence, emphasizes, the, innocence, and, natural, grace, of, the, posing, child, and, soon, became, a, public, favourite, the, idea, of, childhood, as, a, locus, of, divinity, purity, and, innocence, is, further, expounded, upon, in, william, wordsworth, s, ode, intimations, of, immortality, from, recollections, of, early, childhood, the, imagery, of, which, he, fashioned, from, a, complex, mix, of, pastoral, aesthetics, pantheistic, views, of, divinity, and, an, idea, of, spiritual, purity, based, on, an, edenic, notion, of, pastoral, innocence, infused, with, neoplatonic, notions, of, reincarnation, this, romantic, conception, of, childhood, historian, margaret, reeves, suggests, has, a, longer, history, than, generally, recognized, with, its, roots, traceable, to, similarly, imaginative, constructions, of, childhood, circulating, for, example, in, the, neo, platonic, poetry, of, seventeenth, century, metaphysical, poet, henry, vaughan, e, g, the, retreate, 1650, childe, hood, 1655, such, views, contrasted, with, the, stridently, didactic, calvinist, views, of, infant, depravity, with, the, onset, of, industrialisation, in, england, in, 1760, the, divergence, between, high, minded, romantic, ideals, of, childhood, and, the, reality, of, the, growing, magnitude, of, child, exploitation, in, the, workplace, became, increasingly, apparent, by, the, late, 18th, century, british, children, were, specially, employed, in, factories, and, mines, and, as, chimney, sweeps, often, working, long, hours, in, dangerous, jobs, for, low, pay, as, the, century, wore, on, the, contradiction, between, the, conditions, on, the, ground, for, poor, children, and, the, middle, class, notion, of, childhood, as, a, time, of, simplicity, and, innocence, led, to, the, first, campaigns, for, the, imposition, of, legal, protection, for, children, british, reformers, attacked, child, labor, from, the, 1830s, onward, bolstered, by, the, horrific, descriptions, of, london, street, life, by, charles, dickens, the, campaign, eventually, led, to, the, factory, acts, which, mitigated, the, exploitation, of, children, at, the, workplace, the, modern, attitude, to, children, emerged, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, victorian, middle, and, upper, classes, emphasized, the, role, of, the, family, and, the, sanctity, of, the, child, an, attitude, that, has, remained, dominant, in, western, societies, ever, since, the, genre, of, children, s, literature, took, off, with, a, proliferation, of, humorous, child, oriented, books, attuned, to, the, child, s, imagination, lewis, carroll, s, fantasy, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, published, in, 1865, in, england, was, a, landmark, in, the, genre, regarded, as, the, first, english, masterpiece, written, for, children, its, publication, opened, the, first, golden, age, of, children, s, literature, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, introduction, of, compulsory, state, schooling, of, children, across, europe, which, decisively, removed, children, from, the, workplace, into, schools, the, market, economy, of, the, 19th, century, enabled, the, concept, of, childhood, as, a, time, of, fun, happiness, and, imagination, factory, made, dolls, and, doll, houses, delighted, the, girls, and, organized, sports, and, activities, were, played, by, the, boys, the, boy, scouts, was, founded, by, sir, robert, baden, powell, in, 1908, which, provided, young, boys, with, outdoor, activities, aiming, at, developing, character, citizenship, and, personal, fitness, qualities, in, the, 20th, century, philippe, ari, s, a, french, historian, specializing, in, medieval, history, suggested, that, childhood, was, not, a, natural, phenomenon, but, a, creation, of, society, in, his, 1960, book, centuries, of, childhood, in, 1961, he, published, a, study, of, paintings, gravestones, furniture, and, school, records, finding, that, before, the, 17th, century, children, were, represented, as, mini, adults, in, 1966, the, american, philosopher, george, boas, published, the, book, the, cult, of, childhood, since, then, historians, have, increasingly, researched, childhood, in, past, times, in, 2006, hugh, cunningham, published, the, book, invention, of, childhood, looking, at, british, childhood, from, the, year, 1000, the, middle, ages, to, what, he, refers, to, as, the, post, war, period, of, the, 1950s, 1960s, and, 1970s, childhood, evolves, and, changes, as, lifestyles, change, and, adult, expectations, alter, in, the, modern, era, many, adults, believe, that, children, should, not, have, any, worries, or, work, as, life, should, be, happy, and, trouble, free, childhood, is, seen, as, a, mixture, of, simplicity, innocence, happiness, fun, imagination, and, wonder, it, is, thought, of, as, a, time, of, playing, learning, socializing, exploring, and, worrying, in, a, world, without, much, adult, interference, a, loss, of, innocence, is, a, common, concept, and, is, often, seen, as, an, integral, part, of, coming, of, age, it, is, usually, thought, of, as, an, experience, or, period, in, a, child, s, life, that, widens, their, awareness, of, evil, pain, or, the, world, around, them, this, theme, is, demonstrated, in, the, novels, to, kill, a, mockingbird, and, lord, of, the, flies, the, fictional, character, peter, pan, was, the, embodiment, of, a, childhood, that, never, ends, children, s, health, includes, the, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, of, children, maintaining, children, s, health, implies, offering, them, healthy, foods, insuring, they, get, enough, sleep, and, exercise, and, protecting, their, safety, children, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, often, suffer, from, malnutrition, which, is, often, associated, with, other, conditions, such, diarrhea, pneumonia, and, malaria, child, protection, according, to, unicef, refers, to, preventing, and, responding, to, violence, exploitation, and, abuse, against, children, including, commercial, sexual, exploitation, trafficking, child, labour, and, harmful, traditional, practices, such, as, female, genital, mutilation, cutting, and, child, marriage, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, protects, the, fundamental, rights, of, children, play, is, essential, to, the, cognitive, physical, social, and, emotional, well, being, of, children, it, offers, children, opportunities, for, physical, running, jumping, climbing, etc, intellectual, social, skills, community, norms, ethics, and, general, knowledge, and, emotional, development, empathy, compassion, and, friendships, unstructured, play, encourages, creativity, and, imagination, playing, and, interacting, with, other, children, as, well, as, some, adults, provides, opportunities, for, friendships, social, interactions, conflicts, and, resolutions, however, adults, tend, to, often, mistakenly, assume, that, virtually, all, children, s, social, activities, can, be, understood, as, play, and, furthermore, that, children, s, play, activities, do, not, involve, much, skill, or, effort, it, is, through, play, that, children, at, a, very, early, age, engage, and, interact, in, the, world, around, them, play, allows, children, to, create, and, explore, a, world, they, can, master, conquering, their, fears, while, practicing, adult, roles, sometimes, in, conjunction, with, other, children, or, adult, caregivers, undirected, play, allows, children, to, learn, how, to, work, in, groups, to, share, to, negotiate, to, resolve, conflicts, and, to, learn, self, advocacy, skills, however, when, play, is, controlled, by, adults, children, acquiesce, to, adult, rules, and, concerns, and, lose, some, of, the, benefits, play, offers, them, this, is, especially, true, in, developing, creativity, leadership, and, group, skills, play, is, considered, to, be, very, important, to, optimal, child, development, that, it, has, been, recognized, by, the, united, nations, commission, on, human, rights, as, a, right, of, every, child, children, who, are, being, raised, in, a, hurried, and, pressured, style, may, limit, the, protective, benefits, they, would, gain, from, child, driven, play, the, initiation, of, play, in, a, classroom, setting, allows, teachers, and, students, to, interact, through, playfulness, associated, with, a, learning, experience, therefore, playfulness, aids, the, interactions, between, adults, and, children, in, a, learning, environment, playful, structure, means, to, combine, informal, learning, with, formal, learning, to, produce, an, effective, learning, experience, for, children, at, a, young, age, even, though, play, is, considered, to, be, the, most, important, to, optimal, child, development, the, environment, affects, their, play, and, therefore, their, development, poor, children, confront, widespread, environmental, inequities, as, they, experience, less, social, support, and, their, parents, are, less, responsive, and, more, authoritarian, children, from, low, income, families, are, less, likely, to, have, access, to, books, and, computers, which, would, enhance, their, development, children, s, street, culture, refers, to, the, cumulative, culture, created, by, young, children, and, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, their, secret, world, it, is, most, common, in, children, between, the, ages, of, seven, and, twelve, it, is, strongest, in, urban, working, class, industrial, districts, where, children, are, traditionally, free, to, play, out, in, the, streets, for, long, periods, without, supervision, it, is, invented, and, largely, sustained, by, children, themselves, with, little, adult, interference, young, children, s, street,

a, correlation, between, the, declining, number, of, national, park, visits, in, the, u, s, and, increasing, consumption, of, electronic, media, by, children, the, media, has, accelerated, the, trend, for, children, s, nature, disconnection, by, deemphasizing, views, of, nature, as, in, disney, films, the, age, at, which, children, are, considered, responsible, for, their, society, bound, actions, e, g, marriage, voting, etc, has, also, changed, over, time, and, this, is, reflected, in, the, way, they, are, treated, in, courts, of, law, in, roman, times, children, were, regarded, as, not, culpable, for, crimes, a, position, later, adopted, by, the, church, in, the, 19th, century, children, younger, than, seven, years, old, were, believed, incapable, of, crime, children, from, the, age, of, seven, forward, were, considered, responsible, for, their, actions, therefore, they, could, face, criminal, charges, be, sent, to, adult, prison, and, be, punished, like, adults, by, whipping, branding, or, hanging, however, courts, at, the, time, would, consider, the, offender, s, age, when, deliberating, sentencing, minimum, employment, age, and, marriage, age, also, vary, the, age,
