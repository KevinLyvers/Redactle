points, are, scored, for, any, ball, pocketed, during, the, foul, shot, if, dissatisfied, with, the, position, left, after, a, foul, the, next, player, may, nominate, the, opponent, who, committed, the, foul, to, continue, playing, from, where, the, balls, have, come, to, rest, if, the, referee, has, also, called, a, miss, meaning, that, the, offending, player, is, deemed, not, to, have, made, their, best, possible, attempt, to, hit, the, object, ball, the, next, player, has, the, option, of, having, the, balls, replaced, to, their, original, positions, and, forcing, their, opponent, to,
