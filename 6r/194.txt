a, parent, is, either, the, progenitor, of, a, child, or, in, humans, it, can, refer, to, a, caregiver, or, legal, guardian, generally, called, an, adoptive, parent, or, step, parent, the, gametes, of, a, parent, result, in, a, child, a, male, through, the, sperm, and, a, female, through, the, ovum, parents, who, are, progenitors, are, first, degree, relatives, and, have, 50, genetic, meet, a, female, can, also, become, a, parent, through, surrogacy, some, parents, may, be, adoptive, parents, who, nurture, and, raise, an, offspring, but, are, not, related, to, the, child, orphans, without, adoptive, parents, can, be, raised, by, their, grandparents, or, other, family, members, a, parent, can, also, be, elaborated, as, an, ancestor, removed, one, generation, with, recent, medical, advances, it, is, possible, to, have, more, than, two, biological, parents, examples, of, third, biological, parents, include, instances, involving, surrogacy, or, a, third, person, who, has, provided, dna, samples, during, an, assisted, reproductive, procedure, that, has, altered, the, recipients, genetic, material, the, most, common, types, of, parents, are, mothers, fathers, step, parents, and, grandparents, a, mother, is, a, woman, in, relation, to, a, child, or, children, to, whom, she, has, given, birth, the, extent, to, which, it, is, socially, acceptable, for, a, parent, to, be, involved, in, their, offspring, s, life, varies, from, culture, to, culture, however, one, that, exhibits, too, little, involvement, is, sometimes, said, to, exhibit, child, neglect, while, one, that, is, too, involved, is, sometimes, said, to, be, overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or, intrusive, a, person, s, biological, parents, are, the, persons, from, whom, the, individual, inherits, their, genes, the, term, is, generally, only, used, if, there, is, a, need, to, distinguish, an, individual, s, parents, from, their, biological, parents, for, example, an, individual, whose, father, has, remarried, may, call, the, father, s, new, wife, their, stepmother, and, continue, to, refer, to, their, mother, normally, though, someone, who, has, had, little, or, no, contact, with, their, biological, mother, may, address, their, foster, parent, as, their, mother, and, their, biological, mother, as, such, or, perhaps, by, her, first, name, a, mother, is, a, female, who, has, a, maternal, connection, with, another, individual, whether, arising, from, conception, by, giving, birth, to, or, raising, the, individual, in, the, role, of, a, parent, more, than, one, female, may, have, such, connections, with, an, individual, because, of, the, complexity, and, differences, of, a, mother, s, social, cultural, and, religious, definitions, and, roles, it, is, challenging, to, define, a, mother, to, suit, a, universally, accepted, definition, the, utilization, of, a, surrogate, mother, may, result, in, explication, of, there, being, two, biological, mothers, a, father, is, a, male, parent, of, any, type, of, offspring, it, may, be, the, person, who, shares, in, the, raising, of, a, child, or, who, has, provided, the, biological, material, the, sperm, which, results, in, the, birth, of, the, child, grandparents, are, the, parents, of, a, person, s, own, parent, whether, that, be, a, father, or, a, mother, every, sexually, reproducing, creature, who, is, not, a, genetic, chimera, has, a, maximum, of, four, genetic, grandparents, eight, genetic, great, grandparents, sixteen, genetic, great, great, grandparents, and, so, on, rarely, such, as, in, the, case, of, sibling, or, half, sibling, incest, these, numbers, are, lower, a, paternity, test, is, conducted, to, prove, paternity, that, is, whether, a, male, is, the, biological, father, of, another, individual, this, may, be, relevant, in, view, of, rights, and, duties, of, the, father, similarly, a, maternity, test, can, be, carried, out, this, is, less, common, because, at, least, during, childbirth, and, pregnancy, except, in, the, case, of, a, pregnancy, involving, embryo, transfer, or, egg, donation, it, is, obvious, who, the, mother, is, however, it, is, used, in, a, number, of, events, such, as, legal, battles, where, a, person, s, maternity, is, challenged, where, the, mother, is, uncertain, because, she, has, not, seen, her, child, for, an, extended, period, of, time, or, where, deceased, persons, need, to, be, identified, although, not, constituting, completely, reliable, evidence, several, congenital, traits, such, as, attached, earlobes, a, widow, s, peak, or, the, cleft, chin, may, serve, as, tentative, indicators, of, non, parenthood, as, they, are, readily, observable, and, inherited, via, autosomal, dominant, genes, a, more, reliable, way, to, ascertain, parenthood, is, via, dna, analysis, known, as, genetic, fingerprinting, of, individuals, although, older, methods, have, included, abo, blood, group, typing, analysis, of, various, other, proteins, and, enzymes, or, using, human, leukocyte, antigens, the, current, techniques, for, paternity, testing, are, using, polymerase, chain, reaction, and, restriction, fragment, length, polymorphism, for, the, most, part, however, genetic, fingerprinting, has, all, but, taken, over, all, the, other, forms, of, testing, a, legal, guardian, is, a, person, who, has, the, legal, authority, and, the, corresponding, duty, to, care, for, the, personal, and, property, interests, of, another, person, called, a, ward, guardians, are, typically, used, in, three, situations, guardianship, for, an, incapacitated, senior, due, to, old, age, or, infirmity, guardianship, for, a, minor, and, guardianship, for, developmentally, disabled, adults, most, countries, and, states, have, laws, that, provide, that, the, parents, of, a, minor, child, are, the, legal, guardians, of, that, child, and, that, the, parents, can, designate, who, shall, become, the, child, s, legal, guardian, in, the, event, of, death, subject, to, the, approval, of, the, court, some, jurisdictions, allow, a, parent, of, a, child, to, exercise, the, authority, of, a, legal, guardian, without, a, formal, court, appointment, in, such, circumstances, the, parent, acting, in, that, capacity, is, called, the, natural, guardian, of, that, parent, s, child, parenting, or, child, rearing, is, the, process, of, promoting, and, supporting, the, physical, emotional, social, financial, and, intellectual, development, of, a, child, from, infancy, to, adulthood, parenting, refers, to, the, aspects, of, raising, a, child, aside, from, the, biological, relationship, a, child, has, at, least, one, biological, father, and, at, least, one, biological, mother, but, not, every, family, is, a, traditional, nuclear, family, there, are, many, variants, such, as, adoption, shared, parenting, stepfamilies, and, lgbt, parenting, over, which, there, has, been, controversy, the, social, science, literature, rejects, the, notion, that, there, is, an, optimal, gender, mix, of, parents, or, that, children, and, adolescents, with, same, sex, parents, suffer, any, developmental, disadvantages, compared, with, those, with, two, opposite, sex, parents, the, professionals, and, the, major, associations, now, agree, there, is, a, well, established, and, accepted, consensus, in, the, field, that, there, is, no, optimal, gender, combination, of, parents, the, family, studies, literature, indicates, that, it, is, family, processes, such, as, the, quality, of, parenting, and, relationships, within, the, family, that, contribute, to, determining, children, s, well, being, and, outcomes, rather, than, family, structures, per, se, such, as, the, number, gender, sexuality, and, co, habitation, status, of, parents, an, offspring, who, hates, their, father, is, called, a, misopater, one, that, hates, their, mother, is, a, misomater, while, a, parent, that, hates, their, offspring, is, a, misopedist, parent, offspring, conflict, describes, the, evolutionary, conflict, arising, from, differences, in, optimal, fitness, of, parents, and, their, offspring, while, parents, tend, to, maximize, the, number, of, offspring, the, offspring, can, increase, their, fitness, by, getting, a, greater, share, of, parental, investment, often, by, competing, with, their, siblings, the, theory, was, proposed, by, robert, trivers, in, 1974, and, extends, the, more, general, selfish, gene, theory, and, has, been, used, to, explain, many, observed, biological, phenomena, for, example, in, some, bird, species, although, parents, often, lay, two, eggs, and, attempt, to, raise, two, or, more, young, the, strongest, fledgling, takes, a, greater, share, of, the, food, brought, by, parents, and, will, often, kill, the, weaker, sibling, an, act, known, as, siblicide, david, haig, has, argued, that, human, fetal, genes, would, be, selected, to, draw, more, resources, from, the, mother, than, it, would, be, optimal, for, the, mother, to, give, a, hypothesis, that, has, received, empirical, support, the, placenta, for, example, secretes, allocrine, hormones, that, decrease, the, sensitivity, of, the, mother, to, insulin, and, thus, make, a, larger, supply, of, blood, sugar, available, to, the, fetus, the, mother, responds, by, increasing, the, level, of, insulin, in, her, bloodstream, the, placenta, has, insulin, receptors, that, stimulate, the, production, of, insulin, degrading, enzymes, which, counteract, this, effect, in, europe, parents, are, generally, happier, than, non, parents, in, women, happiness, increases, after, the, first, child, but, having, higher, order, children, is, not, associated, with, further, increased, well, being, happiness, seems, to, increase, most, in, the, year, before, and, after, the, first, childbirth
