18th, and, 19th, centuries, they, had, evolved, into, places, of, entertainment, for, the, masses, where, the, public, could, view, freak, shows, acrobatics, conjuring, and, juggling, take, part, in, competitions, and, walk, through, menageries, a, wave, of, innovation, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, created, mechanical, rides, such, as, the, steam, powered, carousel, built, by, thomas, bradshaw, at, the, aylsham, fair, and, its, derivatives, notably, from, frederick, savage, of, king, s, lynn, norfolk, whose, fairground, machinery, was, exported, all, over, the, world, his, galloping, horses, innovation, is, seen, in, carousels, today, this, inaugurated, the, era, of, the, modern, funfair, ride, as, the, working, classes, were, increasingly, able, to, spend, their, surplus, wages, on, entertainment, the, second, influence, was, the, pleasure, garden, an, example, of, this, is, the, world, s, oldest, amusement, park, bakken, the, hill, which, opened, in, mainland, europe, in, 1583, it, is, located, north, of, copenhagen, in, klampenborg, denmark, another, early, garden, was, the, vauxhall, gardens, founded, in, 1661, in, london, by, the, late, 18th, century, the, site, had, an,

a, fixed, park, for, amusement, was, further, developed, with, the, beginning, of, the, world, s, fairs, the, first, world, fair, began, in, 1851, with, the, construction, of, the, landmark, crystal, palace, in, london, england, the, purpose, of, the, exposition, was, to, celebrate, the, industrial, achievement, of, the, nations, of, the, world, and, it, was, designed, to, educate, and, entertain, the, visitors, american, cities, and, businesses, also, saw, the, world, s, fair, as, a, way, of, demonstrating, economic, and, industrial, success, the, world, s, columbian, exposition, of, 1893, in, chicago, illinois, was, an, early, precursor, to, the, modern, amusement, park, the, fair, was, an, enclosed, site, that, merged, entertainment, engineering, and, education, to, entertain, the, masses, it, set, out, to, bedazzle, the, visitors, and, successfully, did, so, with, a, blaze, of, lights, from, the, white, city, to, make, sure, that, the, fair, was, a, financial, success, the, planners, included, a, dedicated, amusement, concessions, area, called, the, midway, plaisance, rides, from, this, fair, captured, the, imagination, of, the, visitors, and, of, amusement, parks, around, the, world, such, as, the, first, steel, ferris, wheel, which, was, found, in, many, other, amusement, areas, such, as, the, prater, by, 1896, also, the, experience, of, the, enclosed, ideal, city, with, wonder, rides, culture, and, progress, electricity, was, based, on, the, creation, of, an, illusory, place, the, midway, introduced, at, the, columbian, exposition, would, become, a, standard, part, of, most, amusement, parks, fairs, carnivals, and, circuses, the, midway, contained, not, only, the, rides, but, other, concessions, and, entertainments, such, as, shooting, galleries, penny, arcades, games, of, chance, and, shows, many, modern, amusement, parks, evolved, from, earlier, pleasure, resorts, that, had, become, popular, with, the, public, for, day, trips, or, weekend,

sudden, influx, of, visitors, arriving, by, rail, provided, the, motivation, for, entrepreneurs, to, build, accommodation, and, create, new, attractions, leading, to, more, visitors, and, a, rapid, cycle, of, growth, throughout, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, in, 1879, large, parts, of, the, promenade, at, blackpool, were, wired, the, lighting, and, its, accompanying, pageants, reinforced, blackpool,

denmark, in, 1951, walt, disney, came, up, with, the, idea, of, having, an, amusement, park, next, to, the, studios, in, burbank, the, park, would, have, been, called, mickey, mouse, park, built, across, the, street, with, a, western, area, featuring, a, steam, driven, paddleboat, a, turn, of, the, century, town, and, a, midway, it, was, rejected, by, the, burbank, city, council, in, fear, of, a, carnival, atmosphere, in, 1952, he, created, wed, enterprises, to, design, the, park, which, was, now, to, be, built, in, anaheim, and, in, 1953, was, able, to, convince, the, bankers, on, funding, the, park, with, the, help, of, a, studio, artist, herb, ryman, by, making, an, aerial, drawing, of, disneyland, by, july, 1954, construction, had, started, with, a, deadline, of, one, year, disneyland, opened, on, july, 17, 1955, and, two, months, after, the, park, opened, it, welcomed, its, one, millionth, guest, because, of, the, financial, success, of, disneyland, the, amusement, industry, was, reinvigorated, what, became, busch, gardens, tampa, opened, in, 1959, as, a, garden, and, bird, sanctuary, six, flags, over, texas, opened, in, 1961, themed, to, the, six, different, countries, that, ruled, over, texas, in, 1964, universal, studios, hollywood, opened, to, the, public, with, a, studio, tour, of, their, backlot, that, had, multiple, adventure, scenes, and, became, a, proper, theme, park, that, same, year, seaworld, san, diego, opened, and, displayed, many, varieties, of, aquatic, and, marine, life, initially, meant, to, house, walt, disney, s, dream, idea, epcot, experimental, prototype, community, of, tomorrow, disney, executives, decided, to, settle, on, building, the, park, first, in, walt, disney, world, and, the, city, later, after, six, years, of, construction, walt, disney, world, opened, to, the, public, on, october, 1, 1971, meant, to, be, a, larger, east, coast, version, of, disneyland, it, had, copies, of, most, of, the, attractions, from, disneyland, except, for, liberty, square, and, the, hall, of, presidents, yet, it, was, financially, the, most, ambitious, project, walt, disney, productions, had, ever, undertaken, and, succeeded, once, the, holiday, crowds, came, in, during, thanksgiving, in, 1982, walt, disney, productions, opened, the, second, walt, disney, world, park, epcot, center, based, on, walt, disney, s, futurist, ideals, and, world, fairs, like, a, world, s, fair, the, park, would, display, the, latest, technologies, in, an, area, called, future, world, and, the, cultural, pavilions, in, world, showcase, in, 1987, disney, announced, that, it, would, open, its, third, disney, world, park, disney, mgm, studios, in, 1989, which, would, have, a, working, backlot, however, universal, knew, that, its, californian, backlot, tour, would, not, work, as, a, standalone, attraction, next, to, disney, world, especially, now, as, disney, built, one, in, disney, mgm, so, it, divided, up, the, segments, of, its, california, tour, into, individual, attractions, such, as, jaws, disaster, and, kongfrontation, disney, mgm, studios, opened, it, on, may, 1, 1989, with, two, major, attractions, the, backlot, tour, and, the, great, movie, ride, the, concept, for, the, park, started, out, as, an, epcot, pavilion, but, was, turned, into, a, park, as, a, half, day, attraction, a, complement, to, the, rest, of, the, resort, the, rest, of, the, park, was, themed, to, 1930s, hollywood, and, featured, lost, parts, of, hollywood, like, the, brown, derby, universal, studios, florida, opened, on, june, 7, 1990, delayed, by, one, year, to, great, fanfare, but, the, primary, attractions, were, experiencing, severe, technical, difficulties, all, three, of, the, park, s, major, attractions, jaws, disaster, and, kongfrontation, were, not, working, and, suffered, major, technical, difficulties, disaster, and, kongfrontation, were, fixed, by, the, end, of, june, but, jaws, had, to, be, rebuilt, and, reopened, three, years, later, however, universal, learned, from, opening, day, and, started, conducting, exit, surveys, and, special, ticket, deals, in, 1992, disney, opened, its, first, european, park, euro, disneyland, outside, of, paris, france, designed, to, be, like, the, magic, kingdom, in, florida, yet, it, caters, to, the, european, tastes, through, changes, including, removing, tomorrowland, and, replacing, it, with, discoveryland, themed, to, the, great, futuristic, thinkers, of, european, culture, such, as, h, g, wells, and, jules, verne, a, recession, in, the, french, economy, and, the, immense, public, backlash, against, the, park, led, to, financial, hardship, putting, the, park, into, debt, however, this, did, not, stop, disney, from, expanding, disney, mgm, studios, with, the, twilight, zone, tower, of, terror, in, 1994, and, building, their, fourth, walt, disney, world, park, disney, s, animal, kingdom, in, the, early, 90s, after, the, opening, of, universal, studios, florida, universal, sought, to, build, a, second, theme, park, one, aimed, more, towards, children, and, their, families, universal, acquired, the, theme, park, rights, to, many, properties, including, marvel, and, dr, seuss, to, build, the, park, around, in, 1999, universal, studios, opened, universal, studios, islands, of, adventure, under, the, new, resort, name, universal, studios, escape, the, park, was, allegedly, designed, by, former, disney, imagineers, who, left, after, the, financial, disaster, of, disneyland, paris, in, the, late, 80s, the, oriental, land, company, the, owners, and, operators, of, tokyo, disneyland, resort, which, opened, in, 1983, wanted, a, second, park, none, of, the, current, non, magic, kingdom, parks, satisfied, the, japanese, but, one, concept, thrown, away, for, disneyland, s, second, gate, inspired, a, new, one, disneysea, tokyo, disneysea, is, themed, after, stories, based, on, the, ocean, and, nautical, adventure, it, was, constructed, at, a, cost, of, 335, billion, and, opened, on, september, 4, 2001, the, park, s, two, signature, attractions, are, a, modernized, version, of, 20, 000, leagues, under, the, sea, and, journey, to, the, center, of, the, earth, in, the, early, 90s, michael, eisner, wanted, to, make, disneyland, in, the, image, of, walt, disney, world, s, resort, style, plans, were, made, for, multiple, hotels, such, as, one, based, on, the, grand, floridian, hotel, and, a, new, west, coast, version, of, epcot, called, westcot, westcot, never, came, to, be, due, to, local, opposition, from, residents, rising, costs, and, the, financial, fallout, of, disneyland, paris, after, a, corporate, retreat, in, colorado, disney, executives, decided, to, make, a, park, themed, to, california, so, that, guests, could, experience, all, of, california, within, the, confines, of, the, disneyland, resort, and, would, be, built, across, from, disneyland, on, its, 100, acre, parking, lot, disney, s, california, adventure, would, be, the, largest, disaster, disney, ever, created, because, unlike, disneyland, it, would, be, set, in, the, modern, day, and, spoof, modern, day, california, with, its, cheap, insincere, and, flat, backdrops, the, park, would, be, adult, focused, sell, fine, food, and, serve, alcohol, when, the, park, opened, on, february, 8, 2001, it, received, a, chilly, reception, for, its, lack, of, attractions, poor, environment, for, example, hollywood, studios, backlot, was, themed, to, a, modern, day, movie, backlot, of, modern, day, hollywood, and, overemphasis, on, retail, and, dining, when, john, hench, an, original, imagineer, who, worked, with, walt, and, was, a, chief, creative, executive, at, imagineering, since, imagineering, was, founded, was, asked, for, his, opinion, on, the, park, he, reportedly, said, i, preferred, the, parking, lot, walt, disney, studios, park, in, paris, was, the, second, disneyland, paris, park, disney, had, to, build, a, second, park, or, risk, losing, the, land, to, the, french, government, the, park, opened, march, 16, 2002, with, only, three, rides, and, california, adventure, style, theming, however, hong, kong,

tickets, and, c, tickets, used, for, the, larger, more, popular, rides, later, the, d, ticket, was, added, then, finally, the, e, ticket, which, was, used, on, the, biggest, and, most, elaborate, rides, like, space, mountain, smaller, tickets, could, be, traded, up, for, use, on, larger, rides, so, that, for, example, two, or, three, a, tickets, would, equal, a, single, b, ticket, disneyland,
