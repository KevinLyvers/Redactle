for, organizing, the, hockey, rules, board, and, developing, the, sport, s, rules, the, sport, is, known, simply, as, hockey, in, countries, where, it, is, the, more, common, form, of, hockey, the, term, field, hockey, is, used, primarily, in, canada, and, the, united, states, where, hockey, more, often, refers, to, ice, hockey, in, sweden, and, finland, the, term, landhockey, and, maahockey, respectively, are, used, translating, to, ground, hockey, in, opposition, to, the, more, standard, ice, hockey, variant, a, popular, variant, is, indoor, field, hockey, which, differs, in, a, number, of, respects, while, embodying, the, primary, principles, of, hockey, according, to, the, international, hockey, federation, fih, the, roots, of, hockey, are, buried, deep, in, antiquity, there, are, historical, records, which, suggest, early, forms, of, hockey, were, played, in, egypt, and, persia, c, 2000, bc, and, in, ethiopia, c, 1000, bc, later, evidence, suggest, that, the, ancient, greeks, romans, and, aztecs, all, played, hockey, like, games, in, ancient, egypt, there, is, a, depiction, of, two, figures, playing, with, sticks, and, ball, in, the, beni, hasan, tomb, of, khety, an, administrator, of, dynasty, xi, in, ancient, greece, there, is, a, similar, image, dated, c, 510, bc, which, may, have, been, called, ker, t, zein, because, it, was, played, with, a, horn, k, ras, in, ancient, greek, and, a, ball, researchers, disagree, over, how, to, interpret, this, image, it, could, have, been, a, team, or, one, on, one, activity, the, depiction, shows, two, active, players, and, other, figures, who, may, be, team, mates, awaiting, a, face, off, or, non, players, waiting, for, their, turn, at, play, billiards, historians, stein, and, rubino, believe, it, was, among, the, games, ancestral, to, lawn, and, field, games, like, hockey, and, ground, billiards, and, near, identical, depictions, appear, in, later, european, illuminated, manuscripts, and, other, works, of, the, 14th, through, 17th, centuries, showing, contemporary, courtly, and, clerical, life, in, east, asia, a, similar, game, was, entertained, using, a, carved, wooden, stick, and, ball, prior, to, 300, bc, in, inner, mongolia, china, the, daur, people, have, for, about, 1, 000, years, been, playing, beikou, a, game, with, some, similarities, to, field, hockey, a, similar, field, hockey, or, ground, billiards, variant, called, suigan, was, played, in, china, during, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, post, dating, the, mongol, led, yuan, dynasty, a, game, similar, to, field, hockey, was, played, in, the, 17th, century, in, punjab, state, in, india, under, name, khido, khundi, khido, refers, to, the, woolen, ball, and, khundi, to, the, stick, in, south, america, most, specifically, in, chile, the, local, natives, of, the, 16th, century, used, to, play, a, game, called, chueca, which, also, shares, common, elements, with, hockey, in, northern, europe, the, games, of, hurling, ireland, and, knattleikr, iceland, both, team, ball, games, involving, sticks, to, drive, a, ball, to, the, opponents, goal, date, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, early, middle, ages, by, the, 12th, century, a, team, ball, game, called, la, soule, or, choule, akin, to, a, chaotic, and, sometimes, long, distance, version, of, hockey, or, rugby, football, depending, on, whether, sticks, were, used, in, a, particular, local, variant, was, regularly, played, in, france, and, southern, britain, between, villages, or, parishes, throughout, the, middle, ages, to, the, early, modern, era, such, games, often, involved, the, local, clergy, or, secular, aristocracy, and, in, some, periods, were, limited, to, them, by, various, anti, gaming, edicts, or, even, banned, altogether, stein, and, rubino, among, others, ultimately, trace, aspects, of, these, games, both, to, rituals, in, antiquity, involving, orbs, and, sceptres, on, the, aristocratic, and, clerical, side, and, to, ancient, military, training, exercises, on, the, popular, side, polo, essentially, hockey, on, horseback, was, devised, by, the, ancient, persians, for, cavalry, training, based, on, the, local, proto, hockey, foot, game, of, the, region, the, word, hockey, itself, has, no, clear, origin, one, belief, is, that, it, was, recorded, in, 1363, when, edward, iii, of, england, issued, the, proclamation, moreover, we, ordain, that, you, prohibit, under, penalty, of, imprisonment, all, and, sundry, from, such, stone, wood, and, iron, throwing, handball, football, or, hockey, coursing, and, cock, fighting, or, other, such, idle, games, the, belief, is, based, on, modern, translations, of, the, proclamation, which, was, originally, in, latin, and, explicitly, forbade, the, games, pilam, manualem, pedivam, bacularem, ad, canibucam, gallorum, pugnam, the, word, baculum, is, the, latin, for, stick, so, the, reference, would, appear, to, be, to, a, game, played, with, sticks, the, english, historian, and, biographer, john, strype, did, not, use, the, word, hockey, when, he, translated, the, proclamation, in, 1720, and, the, word, hockey, remains, of, unknown, origin, the, modern, game, developed, at, public, schools, in, 19th, century, england, it, is, now, played, globally, particularly, in, parts, of, western, europe, south, asia, southern, africa, australia, new, zealand, argentina, and, parts, of, the, united, states, primarily, new, england, and, the, mid, atlantic, states, the, term, field, hockey, is, used, primarily, in, canada, and, the, united, states, where, hockey, more, often, refers, to, ice, hockey, in, sweden, the, term, landhockey, is, used, and, to, some, degree, in, norway, where, the, game, is, governed, by, norges, bandyforbund, the, first, known, club, was, formed, in, 1849, at, blackheath, in, south, east, london, but, the, modern, rules, grew, out, of, a, version, played, by, middlesex, cricket, clubs, as, a, winter, activity, teddington, hockey, club, formed, the, modern, game, by, introducing, the, striking, circle, and, changing, the, ball, to, a, sphere, from, a, rubber, cube, the, hockey, association, was, founded, in, 1876, it, lasted, just, six, years, before, being, revived, by, nine, founding, members, the, first, international, competition, took, place, in, 1895, ireland, 3, wales, 0, and, the, international, rules, board, was, founded, in, 1900, field, hockey, was, played, at, the, summer, olympics, in, 1908, and, 1920, it, was, dropped, in, 1924, leading, to, the, foundation, of, the, f, d, ration, internationale, de, hockey, sur, gazon, fih, as, an, international, governing, body, by, seven, continental, european, nations, and, hockey, was, reinstated, as, an, olympic, game, in, 1928, men, s, hockey, united, under, the, fih, in, 1970, the, two, oldest, trophies, are, the, irish, senior, cup, which, dates, back, to, 1894, and, the, irish, junior, cup, a, second, xi, only, competition, instituted, in, 1895, in, india, the, beighton, cup, and, the, aga, khan, tournament, commenced, within, ten, years, entering, the, olympics, in, 1928, india, won, all, five, games, without, conceding, a, goal, and, won, from, 1932, until, 1956, and, then, in, 1964, and, 1980, pakistan, won, olympics, gold, in, men, s, hockey, in, 1960, 1968, and, 1984, in, fact, all, but, three, of, pakistan, s, 11, olympics, medals, so, far, have, been, in, field, hockey, including, three, gold, three, silver, and, two, bronze, medals, in, the, early, 1970s, artificial, turf, began, to, be, used, synthetic, pitches, changed, most, aspects, of, field, hockey, gaining, speed, new, tactics, and, techniques, such, as, the, indian, dribble, developed, followed, by, new, rules, to, take, account, the, switch, to, synthetic, surfaces, ended, indian, and, pakistani, domination, because, artificial, turf, was, too, expensive, in, developing, countries, since, the, 1970s, australia, the, netherlands, and, germany, have, dominated, at, the, olympics, and, world, cup, stages, women, s, field, hockey, was, first, played, at, british, universities, and, schools, the, first, club, the, molesey, ladies, was, founded, in, 1887, the, first, national, association, was, the, irish, ladies, hockey, union, in, 1894, and, though, rebuffed, by, the, hockey, association, women, s, field, hockey, grew, rapidly, around, the, world, this, led, to, the, international, federation, of, women, s, hockey, association, ifwha, in, 1927, though, this, did, not, include, many, continental, european, countries, where, women, played, as, sections, of, men, s, associations, and, were, affiliated, to, the, fih, the, ifwha, held, conferences, every, three, years, and, tournaments, associated, with, these, were, the, primary, ifwha, competitions, these, tournaments, were, non, competitive, until, 1975, by, the, early, 1970s, there, were, 22, associations, with, women, s, sections, in, the, fih, and, 36, associations, in, the, ifwha, discussions, started, about, a, common, rule, book, the, fih, introduced, competitive, tournaments, in, 1974, forcing, the, acceptance, of, the, principle, of, competitive, field, hockey, by, the, ifwha, in, 1973, it, took, until, 1982, for, the, two, bodies, to, merge, but, this, allowed, the, introduction, of, women, s, field, hockey, to, the, olympic, games, from, 1980, where, as, in, the, men, s, game, the, netherlands, germany, and, australia, have, been, consistently, strong, argentina, has, emerged, as, a, team, to, be, reckoned, with, since, 2000, winning, the, world, championship, in, 2002, and, 2010, and, medals, at, the, last, three, olympics, in, the, united, states, field, hockey, is, played, predominantly, by, girls, and, women, there, are, few, field, hockey, clubs, most, play, taking, place, between, high, school, or, college, sides, the, sport, was, largely, introduced, in, the, u, s, by, constance, applebee, starting, with, a, tour, of, seven, sisters, colleges, in, 1901, and, continuing, through, applebee, s, 24, year, tenure, as, athletic, director, of, bryn, mawr, college, the, strength, of, college, field, hockey, reflects, the, impact, of, title, ix, which, mandated, that, colleges, should, fund, men, s, and, women, s, games, programmes, comparably, hockey, has, been, predominantly, played, on, the, east, coast, specifically, the, mid, atlantic, in, states, such, as, new, jersey, new, york, pennsylvania, maryland, and, virginia, in, recent, years, it, has, become, increasingly, played, on, the, west, coast, and, in, the, midwest, in, other, countries, participation, is, fairly, evenly, balanced, between, men, and, women, for, example, in, the, 2008, 09, season, england, hockey, reported, 2, 488, registered, men, s, teams, 1, 969, women, s, teams, 1, 042, boys, teams, 966, girls, teams, and, 274, mixed, teams, in, 2006, the, irish, hockey, association, reported, that, the, gender, split, among, its, players, was, approximately, 65, female, and, 35, male, in, its, 2008, census, hockey, australia, reported, 40, 534, male, club, players, and, 41, 542, female, most, hockey, field, dimensions, were, originally, fixed, using, whole, numbers, of, imperial, measures, metric, measurements, are, now, the, official, dimensions, as, laid, down, by, the, international, hockey, federation, fih, in, the, rules, of, hockey, the, pitch, is, a, 91, 4, m, 55, m, 100, 0, yd, 60, 1, yd, rectangular, field, at, each, end, is, a, goal, 2, 14, m, 7, ft, high, and, 3, 66, m, 12, ft, wide, as, well, as, lines, across, the, field, 22, 90, m, 25, yd, from, each, end, line, generally, referred, to, as, the, 23, metre, lines, or, the, 25, yard, lines, and, in, the, center, of, the, field, a, spot, 0, 15, m, 6, in, in, diameter, called, the, penalty, spot, or, stroke, mark, is, placed, with, its, centre, 6, 40, m, 7, yd, from, the, centre, of, each, goal, the, shooting, circle, is, 15, m, 16, yd, from, the, base, line, field, hockey, goals, are, made, of, two, upright, posts, joined, at, the, top, by, a, horizontal, crossbar, with, a, net, positioned, to, catch, the, ball, when, it, passes, through, the, goalposts, the, goalposts, and, crossbar, must, be, white, and, rectangular, in, shape, and, should, be, 2, in, 51, mm, wide, and, 2, 3, in, 51, 76, mm, deep, field, hockey, goals, also, include, sideboards, and, a, backboard, which, stand, 50, cm, 20, in, from, the, ground, the, backboard, runs, the, full, 3, 66, m, 12, 0, ft, width, of, the, goal, while, the, sideboards, are, 1, 2, m, 3, ft, 11, in, deep, historically, the, game, developed, on, natural, grass, turf, in, the, early, 1970s, synthetic, grass, fields, began, to, be, used, for, hockey, with, the, first, olympic, games, on, this, surface, being, held, at, montreal, in, 1976, synthetic, pitches, are, now, mandatory, for, all, international, tournaments, and, for, most, national, competitions, while, hockey, is, still, played, on, traditional, grass, fields, at, some, local, levels, and, lesser, national, divisions, it, has, been, replaced, by, synthetic, surfaces, almost, everywhere, in, the, western, world, there, are, three, main, types, of, artificial, hockey, surface, since, the, 1970s, sand, based, pitches, have, been, favoured, as, they, dramatically, speed, up, the, game, however, in, recent, years, there, has, been, a, massive, increase, in, the, number, of, water, based, artificial, turfs, water, based, synthetic, turfs, enable, the, ball, to, be, transferred, more, quickly, than, on, sand, based, surfaces, it, is, this, characteristic, that, has, made, them, the, surface, of, choice, for, international, and, national, league, competitions, water, based, surfaces, are, also, less, abrasive, than, sand, based, surfaces, and, reduce, the, level, of, injury, to, players, when, they, come, into, contact, with, the, surface, following, the, 2018, fih, congress, it, was, decided, that, new, surfaces, being, laid, should, be, of, a, hybrid, variety, which, require, less, watering, this, is, due, to, the, negative, ecological, effects, of, the, high, water, requirements, of, water, based, synthetic, fields, it, has, also, been, stated, that, the, decision, to, make, artificial, surfaces, mandatory, greatly, favoured, more, affluent, countries, who, could, afford, these, new, pitches, the, game, is, played, between, two, teams, of, eleven, 10, field, players, and, one, goal, keeper, are, permitted, to, be, on, the, pitch, at, any, one, time, the, remaining, players, may, be, substituted, in, any, combination, there, is, an, unlimited, number, of, times, a, team, can, sub, in, and, out, substitutions, are, permitted, at, any, point, in, the, game, apart, from, between, the, award, and, end, of, a, penalty, corner, two, exceptions, to, this, rule, is, for, injury, or, suspension, of, the, defending, goalkeeper, which, is, not, allowed, when, playing, with, a, field, keep, or, a, player, can, exit, the, field, but, you, must, wait, until, after, the, penalty, corner, is, complete, play, is, not, stopped, for, a, substitution, except, of, a, goalkeeper, the, players, leave, and, rejoin, the, match, simultaneously, at, the, half, way, line, players, are, permitted, to, play, the, ball, with, the, flat, of, the, face, side, and, with, the, edges, of, the, head, and, handle, of, the, field, hockey, stick, with, the, exception, that, for, reasons, of, safety, the, ball, may, not, be, struck, hard, with, a, forehand, edge, stroke, because, of, the, difficulty, of, controlling, the, height, and, direction, of, the, ball, from, that, stroke, the, flat, side, is, always, on, the, natural, side, for, a, right, handed, person, swinging, the, stick, at, the, ball, from, right, to, left, left, handed, sticks, are, rare, as, international, hockey, federation, rules, forbid, their, use, in, a, game, to, make, a, strike, at, the, ball, with, a, left, to, right, swing, the, player, must, present, the, flat, of, the, face, of, the, stick, to, the, ball, by, reversing, the, stick, head, i, e, by, turning, the, handle, through, approximately, 180, while, a, reverse, edge, hit, would, turn, the, stick, head, through, approximately, 90, from, the, position, of, an, upright, forehand, stroke, with, the, face, of, the, stick, head, edge, hitting, of, the, ball, underwent, a, two, year, experimental, period, twice, the, usual, length, of, an, experimental, trial, and, is, still, a, matter, of, some, controversy, within, the, game, ric, charlesworth, the, former, australian, coach, has, been, a, strong, critic, of, the, unrestricted, use, of, the, reverse, edge, hit, the, hard, forehand, edge, hit, was, banned, after, similar, concerns, were, expressed, about, the, ability, of, players, to, direct, the, ball, accurately, but, the, reverse, edge, hit, does, appear, to, be, more, predictable, and, controllable, than, its, counterpart, this, type, of, hit, is, now, more, commonly, referred, to, as, the, forehand, sweep, where, the, ball, is, hit, with, the, flat, side, or, natural, side, of, the, stick, and, not, the, rounded, edge, other, rules, include, no, foot, to, ball, contact, no, use, of, hands, no, obstructing, other, players, no, high, back, swing, no, hacking, and, no, third, party, if, a, player, is, dribbling, the, ball, and, either, loses, control, and, kicks, the, ball, or, another, player, interferes, that, player, is, not, permitted, to, gain, control, and, continue, dribbling, the, rules, do, not, allow, the, person, who, kicked, the, ball, to, gain, advantage, from, the, kick, so, the, ball, will, automatically, be, passed, on, to, the, opposing, team, conversely, if, no, advantage, is, gained, from, kicking, the, ball, play, should, continue, players, may, not, obstruct, another, s, chance, of, hitting, the, ball, in, any, way, no, shoving, using, your, body, stick, to, prevent, advancement, in, the, other, team, penalty, for, this, is, the, opposing, team, receives, the, ball, and, if, the, problem, continues, the, player, can, be, carded, while, a, player, is, taking, a, free, hit, or, starting, a, corner, the, back, swing, of, their, hit, cannot, be, too, high, for, this, is, considered, dangerous, finally, there, may, not, be, three, players, touching, the, ball, at, one, time, two, players, from, opposing, teams, can, battle, for, the, ball, however, if, another, player, interferes, it, is, considered, third, party, and, the, ball, automatically, goes, to, the, team, who, only, had, one, player, involved, in, the, third, party, a, match, ordinarily, consists, of, two, periods, of, 35, minutes, and, a, halftime, interval, of, 5, minutes, other, periods, and, interval, may, be, agreed, by, both, teams, except, as, specified, in, regulations, for, particular, competitions, since, 2014, some, international, games, have, four, 15, minute, quarters, with, 2, minutes, break, between, each, quarter, and, 5, minutes, break, between, quarter, two, and, three, at, the, 2018, commonwealth, games, held, on, the, gold, coast, in, brisbane, the, hockey, games, for, both, men, and, women, were, played, in, four, 15, minute, quarters, in, december, 2018, the, fih, announced, rule, changes, that, would, make, 15, minute, quarters, universal, from, january, 2019, england, hockey, confirmed, that, while, no, changes, would, be, made, to, the, domestic, game, mid, season, the, new, rules, would, be, implemented, at, the, start, of, the, 2019, 20, season, however, in, july, 2019, england, hockey, announced, that, 17, 5, minute, quarters, would, only, be, implemented, in, elite, domestic, club, games, the, game, begins, with, a, pass, back, from, the, centre, forward, usually, to, the, centre, half, back, from, the, halfway, line, the, opposing, team, cannot, try, to, tackle, this, play, until, the, ball, has, been, pushed, back, the, team, consists, of, eleven, players, usually, aligned, as, follows, goalkeeper, right, fullback, left, fullback, three, half, backs, and, five, forwards, who, are, right, wing, right, inner, centre, forward, left, inner, and, left, wing, these, positions, can, change, and, adapt, throughout, the, course, of, the, game, depending, on, the, attacking, and, defensive, style, of, the, opposition, when, hockey, positions, are, discussed, notions, of, fluidity, are, very, common, each, team, can, be, fielded, with, a, maximum, of, 11, players, and, will, typically, arrange, themselves, into, forwards, midfielders, and, defensive, players, fullbacks, with, players, frequently, moving, between, these, lines, with, the, flow, of, play, each, team, may, also, play, with, as, hockey, has, a, very, dynamic, style, of, play, it, is, difficult, to, simplify, positions, to, the, static, formations, which, are, common, in, association, football, although, positions, will, typically, be, categorised, as, either, fullback, halfback, midfield, inner, or, striker, it, is, important, for, players, to, have, an, understanding, of, every, position, on, the, field, for, example, it, is, not, uncommon, to, see, a, halfback, overlap, and, end, up, in, either, attacking, position, with, the, midfield, and, strikers, being, responsible, for, re, adjusting, to, fill, the, space, they, left, movement, between, lines, like, this, is, particularly, common, across, all, positions, this, fluid, australian, culture, of, hockey, has, been, responsible, for, developing, an, international, trend, towards, players, occupying, spaces, on, the, field, not, having, assigned, positions, although, they, may, have, particular, spaces, on, the, field, which, they, are, more, comfortable, and, effective, as, players, they, are, responsible, for, occupying, the, space, nearest, them, this, fluid, approach, to, hockey, and, player, movement, has, made, it, easy, for, teams, to, transition, between, formations, such, as, 3, at, the, back, 5, midfields, 2, at, the, front, and, more, when, the, ball, is, inside, the, circle, they, are, defending, and, they, have, their, stick, in, their, hand, goalkeepers, wearing, full, protective, equipment, are, permitted, to, use, their, stick, feet, kickers, or, leg, guards, to, propel, the, ball, and, to, use, their, stick, feet, kickers, leg,

stick, they, are, not, allowed, to, use, their, feet, and, legs, to, propel, the, ball, stop, the, ball, or, deflect, it, in, any, direction, including, over, the, back, line, however, neither, goalkeepers, or, players, with, goalkeeping, privileges, are, permitted, to, conduct, themselves, in, a, manner, which, is, dangerous, to, other, players, by, taking, advantage, of, the, protective, equipment, they, wear, neither, goalkeepers, or, players, with, goalkeeping, privileges, may, lie, on, the, ball, however, they, are, permitted, to, use, arms, hands, and, any, other, part, of, their, body, to, push, the, ball, away, lying, on, the, ball, deliberately, will, result, in, a, penalty, stroke, whereas, if, an, umpire, deems, a, goalkeeper, has, lain, on, the, ball, accidentally, e, g, it, gets, stuck, in, their, protective, equipment, a, penalty, corner, is, awarded, the, action, above, is, permitted, only, as, part, of, a, goal, saving, action, or, to, move, the, ball, away, from, the, possibility, of, a, goal, scoring, action, by, opponents, it, does, not, permit, a, goalkeeper, or, player, with, goalkeeping, privileges, to, propel, the, ball, forcefully, with, arms, hands, or, body, so, that, it, travels, a, long, distance, when, the, ball, is, outside, the, circle, they, are, defending, goalkeepers, or, players, with, goalkeeping, privileges, are, only, permitted, to, play, the, ball, with, their, stick, further, a, goalkeeper, or, player, with, goalkeeping, privileges, who, is, wearing, a, helmet, must, not, take, part, in, the, match, outside, the, 23m, area, they, are, defending, except, when, taking, a, penalty, stroke, a, goalkeeper, must, wear, protective, headgear, at, all, times, except, when, taking, a, penalty, stroke, for, the, purposes, of, the, rules, all, players, on, the, team, in, possession, of, the, ball, are, attackers, and, those, on, the, team, without, the, ball, are, defenders, yet, throughout, the, game, being, played, you, are, always, defending, your, goal, and, attacking, the, opposite, goal, the, match, is, officiated, by, two, field, umpires, traditionally, each, umpire, generally, controls, half, of, the, field, divided, roughly, diagonally, these, umpires, are, often, assisted, by, a, technical, bench, including, a, timekeeper, and, record, keeper, prior, to, the, start, of, the, game, a, coin, is, tossed, and, the, winning, captain, can, choose, a, starting, end, or, whether, to, start, with, the, ball, since, 2017, the, game, consists, of, four, periods, of, 15, minutes, with, a, 2, minute, break, after, every, period, and, a, 15, minute, intermission, at, half, time, before, changing, ends, at, the, start, of, each, period, as, well, as, after, goals, are, scored, play, is, started, with, a, pass, from, the, centre, of, the, field, all, players, must, start, in, their, defensive, half, apart, from, the, player, making, the, pass, but, the, ball, may, be, played, in, any, direction, along, the, floor, each, team, starts, with, the, ball, in, one, half, and, the, team, that, conceded, the, goal, has, possession, for, the, restart, teams, trade, sides, at, halftime, field, players, may, only, play, the, ball, with, the, face, of, the, stick, if, the, back, side, of, the, stick, is, used, it, is, a, penalty, and, the, other, team, will, get, the, ball, back, tackling, is, permitted, as, long, as, the, tackler, does, not, make, contact, with, the, attacker, or, the, other, person, s, stick, before, playing, the, ball, contact, after, the, tackle, may, also, be, penalised, if, the, tackle, was, made, from, a, position, where, contact, was, inevitable, further, the, player, with, the, ball, may, not, deliberately, use, his, body, to, push, a, defender, out, of, the, way, field, players, may, not, play, the, ball, with, their, feet, but, if, the, ball, accidentally, hits, the, feet, and, the, player, gains, no, benefit, from, the, contact, then, the, contact, is, not, penalised, although, there, has, been, a, change, in, the, wording, of, this, rule, from, 1, january, 2007, the, current, fih, umpires, briefing, instructs, umpires, not, to, change, the, way, they, interpret, this, rule, obstruction, typically, occurs, in, three, circumstances, when, a, defender, comes, between, the, player, with, possession, and, the, ball, in, order, to, prevent, them, tackling, when, a, defender, s, stick, comes, between, the, attacker, s, stick, and, the, ball, or, makes, contact, with, the, attacker, s, stick, or, body, and, also, when, blocking, the, opposition, s, attempt, to, tackle, a, teammate, with, the, ball, called, third, party, obstruction, when, the, ball, passes, completely, over, the, sidelines, on, the, sideline, is, still, in, it, is, returned, to, play, with, a, sideline, hit, taken, by, a, member, of, the, team, whose, players, were, not, the, last, to, touch, the, ball, before, crossing, the, sideline, the, ball, must, be, placed, on, the, sideline, with, the, hit, taken, from, as, near, the, place, the, ball, went, out, of, play, as, possible, if, it, crosses, the, back, line, after, last, touched, by, an, attacker, a, 15, m, 16, yd, hit, is, awarded, a, 15, m, hit, is, also, awarded, for, offences, committed, by, the, attacking, side, within, 15, m, of, the, end, of, the, pitch, they, are, attacking, set, plays, are, often, utilised, for, specific, situations, such, as, a, penalty, corner, or, free, hit, for, instance, many, teams, have, penalty, corner, variations, that, they, can, use, to, beat, the, defensive, team, the, coach, may, have, plays, that, sends, the, ball, between, two, defenders, and, lets, the, player, attack, the, opposing, team, s, goal, there, are, no, set, plays, unless, your, team, has, them, free, hits, are, awarded, when, offences, are, committed, outside, the, scoring, circles, the, term, free, hit, is, standard, usage, but, the, ball, need, not, be, hit, the, ball, may, be, hit, pushed, or, lifted, in, any, direction, by, the, team, offended, against, the, ball, can, be, lifted, from, a, free, hit, but, not, by, hitting, the, ball, must, be, flicked, or, scooped, to, lift, from, a, free, hit, in, previous, versions, of, the, rules, hits, in, the, area, outside, the, circle, in, open, play, have, been, permitted, but, lifting, one, direction, from, a, free, hit, was, prohibited, opponents, must, move, 5, m, 5, 5, yd, from, the, ball, when, a, free, hit, is, awarded, a, free, hit, must, be, taken, from, within, playing, distance, of, the, place, of, the, offence, for, which, it, was, awarded, and, the, ball, must, be, stationary, when, the, free, hit, is, taken, as, mentioned, above, a, 15, m, hit, is, awarded, if, an, attacking, player, commits, a, foul, forward, of, that, line, or, if, the, ball, passes, over, the, back, line, off, an, attacker, these, free, hits, are, taken, in, line, with, where, the, foul, was, committed, taking, a, line, parallel, with, the, sideline, between, where, the, offence, was, committed, or, the, ball, went, out, of, play, when, an, attacking, free, hit, is, awarded, within, 5, m, of, the, circle, everyone, including, the, person, taking, the, penalty, must, be, five, meters, from, the, circle, and, everyone, apart, from, the, person, taking, the, free, hit, must, be, five, meters, away, from, the, ball, when, taking, an, attacking, free, hit, the, ball, may, not, be, hit, straight, into, the, circle, if, the, hitting, player, is, within, their, attacking, 23, meter, area, 25, yard, area, it, has, to, travel, 5, meters, before, going, in, in, february, 2009, the, fih, introduced, as, a, mandatory, experiment, for, international, competition, an, updated, version, of, the, free, hit, rule, the, changes, allows, a, player, taking, a, free, hit, to, pass, the, ball, to, themselves, importantly, this, is, not, a, play, on, situation, but, to, the, untrained, eye, it, may, appear, to, be, the, player, must, play, the, ball, any, distance, in, two, separate, motions, before, continuing, as, if, it, were, a, play, on, situation, they, may, raise, an, aerial, or, overhead, immediately, as, the, second, action, or, any, other, stroke, permitted, by, the, rules, of, field, hockey, at, high, school, level, this, is, called, a, self, pass, and, was, adopted, in, pennsylvania, in, 2010, as, a, legal, technique, for, putting, the, ball, in, play, also, all, players, from, both, teams, must, be, at, least, 5, m, from, any, free, hit, awarded, to, the, attack, within, the, 23, m, area, the, ball, may, not, travel, directly, into, the, circle, from, a, free, hit, to, the, attack, within, the, 23, m, area, without, first, being, touched, by, another, player, or, being, dribbled, at, least, 5, m, by, a, player, making, a, self, pass, these, experimental, rules, apply, to, all, free, hit, situations, including, sideline, and, corner, hits, national, associations, may, also, choose, to, introduce, these, rules, for, their, domestic, competitions, a, free, hit, from, the, 23, metre, line, called, a, long, corner, is, awarded, to, the, attacking, team, if, the, ball, goes, over, the, back, line, after, last, being, touched, by, a, defender, provided, they, do, not, play, it, over, the, back, line, deliberately, in, which, case, a, penalty, corner, is, awarded, this, free, hit, is, played, by, the, attacking, team, from, a, spot, on, the, 23, metre, line, in, line, with, where, the, ball, went, out, of, play, all, the, parameters, of, an, attacking, free, hit, within, the, attacking, quarter, of, the, playing, surface, apply, the, short, or, penalty, corner, is, awarded, short, corners, begin, with, five, defenders, usually, including, the, keeper, positioned, behind, the, back, line, and, the, ball, placed, at, least, 10, yards, from, the, nearest, goal, post, all, other, players, in, the, defending, team, must, be, beyond, the, centre, line, that, is, not, in, their, own, half, of, the, pitch, until, the, ball, is, in, play, attacking, players, begin, the, play, standing, outside, the, scoring, circle, except, for, one, attacker, who, starts, the, corner, by, playing, the, ball, from, a, mark, 10, m, either, side, of, the, goal, the, circle, has, a, 14, 63, m, radius, this, player, puts, the, ball, into, play, by, pushing, or, hitting, the, ball, to, the, other, attackers, outside, the, circle, the, ball, must, pass, outside, the, circle, and, then, put, back, into, the, circle, before, the, attackers, may, make, a, shot, at, the, goal, from, which, a, goal, can, be, scored, fih, rules, do, not, forbid, a, shot, at, goal, before, the, ball, leaves, the, circle, after, being, inserted, nor, is, a, shot, at, the, goal, from, outside, the, circle, prohibited, but, a, goal, cannot, be, scored, at, all, if, the, ball, has, not, gone, out, of, the, circle, and, cannot, be, scored, from, a, shot, from, outside, the, circle, if, it, is, not, again, played, by, an, attacking, player, before, it, enters, the, goal, for, safety, reasons, the, first, shot, of, a, penalty, corner, must, not, exceed, 460, mm, high, the, height, of, the, backboard, of, the, goal, at, the, point, it, crosses, the, goal, line, if, it, is, hit, however, if, the, ball, is, deemed, to, be, below, backboard, height, the, ball, can, be, subsequently, deflected, above, this, height, by, another, player, defender, or, attacker, providing, that, this, deflection, does, not, lead, to, danger, the, slap, stroke, a, sweeping, motion, towards, the, ball, where, the, stick, is, kept, on, or, close, to, the, ground, when, striking, the, ball, is, classed, as, a, hit, and, so, the, first, shot, at, goal, must, be, below, backboard, height, for, this, type, of, shot, also, if, the, first, shot, at, goal, in, a, short, corner, situation, is, a, push, flick, or, scoop, in, particular, the, drag, flick, which, has, become, popular, at, international, and, national, league, standards, the, shot, is, permitted, to, rise, above, the, height, of, the, backboard, as, long, as, the, shot, is, not, deemed, dangerous, to, any, opponent, this, form, of, shooting, was, developed, because, it, is, not, height, restricted, in, the, same, way, as, the, first, hit, shot, at, the, goal, and, players, with, good, technique, are, able, to, drag, flick, with, as, much, power, as, many, others, can, hit, a, ball, a, penalty, stroke, is, awarded, when, a, defender, commits, a, foul, in, the, circle, accidental, or, otherwise, that, prevents, a, probable, goal, or, commits, a, deliberate, foul, in, the, circle, or, if, defenders, repeatedly, run, from, the, back, line, too, early, at, a, penalty, corner, the, penalty, stroke, is, taken, by, a, single, attacker, in, the, circle, against, the, goalkeeper, from, a, spot, 6, 4, m, from, goal, the, ball, is, played, only, once, at, goal, by, the, attacker, using, a, push, flick, or, scoop, stroke, if, the, shot, is, saved, play, is, restarted, with, a, 15, m, hit, to, the, defenders, when, a, goal, is, scored, play, is, restarted, in, the, normal, way, according, to, the, rules, of, hockey, 2015, issued, by, the, fih, there, are, only, two, criteria, for, a, dangerously, played, ball, the, first, is, legitimate, evasive, action, by, an, opponent, what, constitutes, legitimate, evasive, action, is, an, umpiring, judgment, the, second, is, specific, to, the, rule, concerning, a, shot, at, goal, at, a, penalty, corner, but, is, generally, if, somewhat, inconsistently, applied, throughout, the, game, and, in, all, parts, of, the, pitch, it, is, that, a, ball, lifted, above, knee, height, and, at, an, opponent, who, is, within, 5m, of, the, ball, is, certainly, dangerous, the, velocity, of, the, ball, is, not, mentioned, in, the, rules, concerning, a, dangerously, played, ball, a, ball, that, hits, a, player, above, the, knee, may, on, some, occasions, not, be, penalised, this, is, at, the, umpire, s, discretion, a, jab, tackle, for, example, might, accidentally, lift, the, ball, above, knee, height, into, an, opponent, from, close, range, but, at, such, low, velocity, as, not, to, be, in, the, opinion, of, the, umpire, dangerous, play, in, the, same, way, a, high, velocity, hit, at, very, close, range, into, an, opponent, but, below, knee, height, could, be, considered, to, be, dangerous, or, reckless, play, in, the, view, of, the, umpire, especially, when, safer, alternatives, are, open, to, the, striker, of, the, ball, a, ball, that, has, been, lifted, high, so, that, it, will, fall, among, close, opponents, may, be, deemed, to, be, potentially, dangerous, and, play, may, be, stopped, for, that, reason, a, lifted, ball, that, is, falling, to, a, player, in, clear, space, may, be, made, potentially, dangerous, by, the, actions, of, an, opponent, closing, to, within, 5m, of, the, receiver, before, the, ball, has, been, controlled, to, ground, a, rule, which, is, often, only, loosely, applied, the, distance, allowed, is, often, only, what, might, be, described, as, playing, distance, 2, 3, m, and, opponents, tend, to, be, permitted, to, close, on, the, ball, as, soon, as, the, receiver, plays, it, these, unofficial, variations, are, often, based, on, the, umpire, s, perception, of, the, skill, of, the, players, i, e, on, the, level, of, the, game, in, order, to, maintain, game, flow, which, umpires, are, in, general, in, both, rules, and, briefing, instructed, to, do, by, not, penalising, when, it, is, unnecessary, to, do, so, this, is, also, a, matter, at, the, umpire, s, discretion, the, term, falling, ball, is, important, in, what, may, be, termed, encroaching, offences, it, is, generally, only, considered, an, offence, to, encroach, on, an, opponent, receiving, a, lifted, ball, that, has, been, lifted, to, above, head, height, although, the, height, is, not, specified, in, rule, and, is, falling, so, for, example, a, lifted, shot, at, the, goal, which, is, still, rising, as, it, crosses, the, goal, line, or, would, have, been, rising, as, it, crossed, the, goal, line, can, be, legitimately, followed, up, by, any, of, the, attacking, team, looking, for, a, rebound, in, general, even, potentially, dangerous, play, is, not, penalised, if, an, opponent, is, not, disadvantaged, by, it, or, obviously, not, injured, by, it, so, that, he, cannot, continue, a, personal, penalty, that, is, a, caution, or, a, suspension, rather, than, a, team, penalty, such, as, a, free, ball, or, a, penalty, corner, may, be, many, would, say, should, be, or, even, must, be, but, again, this, is, at, the, umpire, s, discretion, issued, to, the, guilty, party, after, an, advantage, allowed, by, the, umpire, has, been, played, out, in, any, situation, where, an, offence, has, occurred, including, dangerous, play, but, once, advantage, has, been, allowed, the, umpire, cannot, then, call, play, back, and, award, a, team, penalty, it, is, not, an, offence, to, lift, the, ball, over, an, opponent, s, stick, or, body, on, the, ground, provided, that, it, is, done, with, consideration, for, the, safety, of, the, opponent, and, not, dangerously, for, example, a, skilful, attacker, may, lift, the, ball, over, a, defender, s, stick, or, prone, body, and, run, past, them, however, if, the, attacker, lifts, the, ball, into, or, at, the, defender, s, body, this, would, almost, certainly, be, regarded, as, dangerous, it, is, not, against, the, rules, to, bounce, the, ball, on, the, stick, and, even, to, run, with, it, while, doing, so, as, long, as, that, does, not, lead, to, a, potentially, dangerous, conflict, with, an, opponent, who, is, attempting, to, make, a, tackle, for, example, two, players, trying, to, play, at, the, ball, in, the, air, at, the, same, time, would, probably, be, considered, a, dangerous, situation, and, it, is, likely, that, the, player, who, first, put, the, ball, up, or, who, was, so, carrying, it, would, be, penalised, dangerous, play, rules, also, apply, to, the, usage, of, the, stick, when, approaching, the, ball, making, a, stroke, at, it, replacing, what, was, at, one, time, referred, to, as, the, sticks, rule, which, once, forbade, the, raising, of, any, part, of, the, stick, above, the, shoulder, during, any, play, this, last, restriction, has, been, removed, but, the, stick, should, still, not, be, used, in, a, way, that, endangers, an, opponent, or, attempting, to, tackle, fouls, relating, to, tripping, impeding, and, obstruction, the, use, of, the, stick, to, strike, an, opponent, will, usually, be, much, more, severely, dealt, with, by, the, umpires, than, offences, such, as, barging, impeding, and, obstruction, with, the, body, although, these, are, also, dealt, with, firmly, especially, when, these, fouls, are, intentional, hockey, uses, a, three, tier, penalty, card, system, of, warnings, and, suspensions, if, a, coach, is, sent, off, depending, on, local, rules, a, player, may, have, to, leave, the, field, for, the, remaining, length, of, the, match, in, addition, to, their, colours, field, hockey, penalty, cards, are, often, shaped, differently, so, they, can, be, recognised, easily, green, cards, are, normally, triangular, yellow, cards, rectangular, and, red, cards, circular, unlike, football, a, player, may, receive, more, than, one, green, or, yellow, card, however, they, cannot, receive, the, same, card, for, the, same, offence, for, example, two, yellows, for, dangerous, play, and, the, second, must, always, be, a, more, serious, card, in, the, case, of, a, second, yellow, card, for, a, different, breach, of, the, rules, for, example, a, yellow, for, deliberate, foot, and, a, second, later, in, the, game, for, dangerous, play, the, temporary, suspension, would, be, expected, to, be, of, considerably, longer, duration, than, the, first, however, local, playing, conditions, may, mandate, that, cards, are, awarded, only, progressively, and, not, allow, any, second, awards, umpires, if, the, free, hit, would, have, been, in, the, attacking, 23, m, area, may, upgrade, the, free, hit, to, a, penalty, corner, for, dissent, or, other, misconduct, after, the, free, hit, has, been, awarded, the, teams, object, is, to, play, the, ball, into, their, attacking, circle, and, from, there, hit, push, or, flick, the, ball, into, the, goal, scoring, a, goal, the, team, with, more, goals, after, 60, minutes, wins, the, game, the, playing, time, may, be, shortened, particularly, when, younger, players, are, involved, or, for, some, tournament, play, if, the, game, is, played, in, a, countdown, clock, like, ice, hockey, a, goal, can, only, count, if, the, ball, completely, crosses, the, goal, line, and, into, the, goal, before, time, expires, not, when, the, ball, leaves, the, stick, in, the, act, of, shooting, if, the, score, is, tied, at, the, end, of, the, game, either, a, draw, is, declared, or, the, game, goes, into, extra, time, or, there, is, a, penalty, shoot, out, depending, on, the, format, of, the, competition, in, many, competitions, such, as, regular, club, competition, or, in, pool, games, in, fih, international, tournaments, such, as, the, olympics, or, the, world, cup, a, tied, result, stands, and, the, overall, competition, standings, are, adjusted, accordingly, since, march, 2013, when, tie, breaking, is, required, the, official, fih, tournament, regulations, mandate, to, no, longer, have, extra, time, and, go, directly, into, a, penalty, shoot, out, when, a, classification, match, ends, in, a, tie, however, many, associations, follow, the, previous, procedure, consisting, of, two, periods, of, 7, 5, minutes, of, golden, goal, extra, time, during, which, the, game, ends, as, soon, as, one, team, scores, there, are, many, variations, to, overtime, play, that, depend, on, the, league, or, tournament, rules, in, american, college, play, a, seven, a, side, overtime, period, consists, of, a, 10, minute, golden, goal, period, with, seven, players, for, each, team, if, the, scores, remain, equal, the, game, enters, a, one, on, one, competition, where, each, team, chooses, five, players, to, dribble, from, the, 25, yard, 23, m, line, down, to, the, circle, against, the, opposing, goalkeeper, the, player, has, eight, seconds, to, score, against, the, goalkeeper, while, keeping, the, ball, in, bounds, the, game, ends, after, a, goal, is, scored, the, ball, goes, out, of, bounds, a, foul, is, committed, ending, in, either, a, penalty, stroke, or, flick, or, the, end, of, the, one, on, one, or, time, expires, if, the, tie, still, persists, more, rounds, are, played, until, one, team, has, scored, the, fih, implemented, a, two, year,

variations, in, rules, from, competition, to, competition, for, instance, the, duration, of, matches, is, often, varied, for, junior, competitions, or, for, carnivals, different, national, associations, also, have, slightly, differing, rules, on, player, equipment, the, new, euro, hockey, league, and, the, olympics, has, made, major, alterations, to, the, rules, to, aid, television, viewers, such, as, splitting, the, game, into, four, quarters, and, to, try, to, improve, player, behavior, such, as, a, two, minute, suspension, for, green, cards, the, latter, was, also, used, in, the, 2010, world, cup, and, 2016, olympics, in, the, united, states, the, ncaa, has, its, own, rules, for, inter, collegiate, competitions, high, school, associations, similarly, play, to, different,

wear, mouth, guards, and, shin, guards, in, order, to, play, the, game, also, there, is, a, newer, rule, requiring, certain, types, of, sticks, be, used, in, recent, years, the, nfhs, rules, have, moved, closer, to, fih, but, in, 2011, a, new, rule, requiring, protective, eyewear, was, introduced, for, the, 2011, fall, season, further, clarification, of, nfhs, s, rule, requiring, protective, eyewear, states, effective, 1, january, 2019, all, eye, protection, shall, be, permanently, labeled, with, the, current, astm, 2713, standard, for, field, hockey, metal, cage, style, goggles, favored, by, us, high, school, lacrosse, and, permitted, in, high, school, field, hockey, is, prohibited, under, fih, rules, each, player, carries, a, hockey, stick, that, normally, measures, between, 80, and, 95, cm, 31, and, 37, in, shorter, or, longer, sticks, are, available, the, length, of, the, stick, is, based, on, the, player, s, individual, height, the, top, of, the, stick, usually, comes, to, the, player, s, hip, and, taller, players, typically, have, longer, sticks, goalkeepers, can, use, either, a, specialised, stick, or, an, ordinary, field, hockey, stick, the, specific, goal, keeping, sticks, have, another, curve, at, the, end, of, the, stick, to, give, it, more, surface, area, to, block, the, ball, sticks, were, traditionally, made, of, wood, but, are, now, often, made, also, with, fibreglass, kevlar, or, carbon, fibre, composites, metal, is, forbidden, from, use, in, field, hockey, sticks, due, to, the, risk, of, injury, from, sharp, edges, if, the, stick, were, to, break, the, stick, has, a, rounded, handle, has, a, j, shaped, hook, at, the, bottom, and, is, flattened, on, the, left, side, when, looking, down, the, handle, with, the, hook, facing, upwards, all, sticks, must, be, right, handed, left, handed, ones, are, prohibited, there, was, traditionally, a, slight, curve, called, the, bow, or, rake, from, the, top, to, bottom, of, the, face, side, of, the, stick, and, another, on, the, heel, edge, to, the, top, of, the, handle, usually, made, according, to, the, angle, at, which, the, handle, part, was, inserted, into, the, splice, of, the, head, part, of, the, stick, which, assisted, in, the, positioning, of, the, stick, head, in, relation, to, the, ball, and, made, striking, the, ball, easier, and, more, accurate, the, hook, at, the, bottom, of, the, stick, was, only, recently, the, tight, curve, indian, style, that, we, have, nowadays, the, older, english, sticks, had, a, longer, bend, making, it, very, hard, to, use, the, stick, on, the, reverse, for, this, reason, players, now, use, the, tight, curved, sticks, the, handle, makes, up, about, the, top, third, of, the, stick, it, is, wrapped, in, a, grip, similar, to, that, used, on, tennis, racket, the, grip, may, be, made, of, a, variety, of, materials, including, chamois, leather, which, improves, grip, in, the, wet, and, gives, the, stick, a, softer, touch, and, different, weighting, it, wrapped, over, a, preexisting, grip, it, was, recently, discovered, that, increasing, the, depth, of, the, face, bow, made, it, easier, to, get, high, speeds, from, the, dragflick, and, made, the, stroke, easier, to, execute, at, first, after, this, feature, was, introduced, the, hockey, rules, board, placed, a, limit, of, 50, mm, on, the, maximum, depth, of, bow, over, the, length, of, the, stick, but, experience, quickly, demonstrated, this, to, be, excessive, new, rules, now, limit, this, curve, to, under, 25, mm, so, as, to, limit, the, power, with, which, the, ball, can, be, flicked, standard, field, hockey, balls, are, hard, spherical, balls, made, of, solid, plastic, sometimes, over, a, cork, core, and, are, usually, white, although, they, can, be, any, colour, as, long, as, they, contrast, with, the, playing, surface, the, balls, have, a, diameter, of, 71, 3, 74, 8, mm, 2, 81, 2, 94, in, and, a, mass, of, 156, 163, g, 5, 5, 5, 7, oz, the, ball, is, often, covered, with, indentations, to, reduce, aquaplaning, that, can, cause, an, inconsistent, ball, speed, on, wet, surfaces, international, hockey, federation, rules, for, women, are, written, so, players, may, choose, between, shorts, skorts, or, skirts, if, they, have, the, same, design, and, color, across, the, team, a, previous, requirement, was, for, women, to, wear, skirts, during, play, the, 2007, rulebook, saw, major, changes, regarding, goalkeepers, a, fully, equipped, goalkeeper, must, wear, a, helmet, leg, guards, and, kickers, and, like, all, players, they, must, carry, a, stick, goalkeepers, may, use, either, a, field, player, s, stick, or, a, specialised, goalkeeping, stick, provided, always, the, stick, is, of, legal, dimensions, usually, field, hockey, goalkeepers, also, wear, extensive, additional, protective, equipment, including, chest, guards, padded, shorts, heavily, padded, hand, protectors, groin, protectors, neck, protectors, and, arm, guards, a, goalie, may, not, cross, the, 23, m, line, the, sole, exception, to, this, being, if, the, goalkeeper, is, to, take, a, penalty, stroke, at, the, other, end, of, the, field, when, the, clock, is, stopped, the, goalkeeper, can, also, remove, their, helmet, for, this, action, while, goalkeepers, are, allowed, to, use, their, feet, and, hands, to, clear, the, ball, like, field, players, they, may, only, use, the, one, side, of, their, stick, slide, tackling, is, permitted, as, long, as, it, is, with, the, intention, of, clearing, the, ball, not, aimed, at, a, player, it, is, now, also, even, possible, for, teams, to, have, a, full, eleven, outfield, players, and, no, goalkeeper, at, all, no, player, may, wear, a, helmet, or, other, goalkeeping, equipment, neither, will, any, player, be, able, to, play, the, ball, with, any, other, part, of, the, body, than, with, their, stick, this, may, be, used, to, offer, a, tactical, advantage, for, example, if, a, team, is, trailing, with, only, a, short, time, to, play, or, to, allow, for, play, to, commence, if, no, goalkeeper, or, kit, is, available, the, basic, tactic, in, field, hockey, as, in, association, football, and, many, other, team, games, is, to, outnumber, the, opponent, in, a, particular, area, of, the, field, at, a, moment, in, time, when, in, possession, of, the, ball, this, temporary, numerical, superiority, can, be, used, to, pass, the, ball, around, opponents, so, that, they, cannot, effect, a, tackle, because, they, cannot, get, within, playing, reach, of, the, ball, and, to, further, use, this, numerical, advantage, to, gain, time, and, create, clear, space, for, making, scoring, shots, on, the, opponent, s, goal, when, not, in, possession, of, the, ball, numerical, superiority, is, used, to, isolate, and, channel, an, opponent, in, possession, and, mark, out, any, passing, options, so, that, an, interception, or, a, tackle, may, be, made, to, gain, possession, highly, skillful, players, can, sometimes, get, the, better, of, more, than, one, opponent, and, retain, the, ball, and, successfully, pass, or, shoot, but, this, tends, to, use, more, energy, than, quick, early, passing, every, player, has, a, role, depending, on, their, relationship, to, the, ball, if, the, team, communicates, throughout, the, play, of, the, game, there, will, be, players, on, the, ball, offensively, ball, carriers, defensively, pressure, support, players, and, movement, players, the, main, methods, by, which, the, ball, is, moved, around, the, field, by, players, are, a, passing, b, pushing, the, ball, and, running, with, it, controlled, to, the, front, or, right, of, the, body, and, c, dribbling, where, the, player, controls, the, ball, with, the, stick, and, moves, in, various, directions, with, it, to, elude, opponents, to, make, a, pass, the, ball, may, be, propelled, with, a, pushing, stroke, where, the, player, uses, their, wrists, to, push, the, stick, head, through, the, ball, while, the, stick, head, is, in, contact, with, it, the, flick, or, scoop, similar, to, the, push, but, with, an, additional, arm, and, leg, and, rotational, actions, to, lift, the, ball, off, the, ground, and, the, hit, where, a, swing, at, ball, is, taken, and, contact, with, it, is, often, made, very, forcefully, causing, the, ball, to, be, propelled, at, velocities, in, excess, of, 70, mph, 110, km, h, in, order, to, produce, a, powerful, hit, usually, for, travel, over, long, distances, or, shooting, at, the, goal, the, stick, is, raised, higher, and, swung, with, maximum, power, at, the, ball, a, stroke, sometimes, known, as, a, drive, tackles, are, made, by, placing, the, stick, into, the, path, of, the, ball, or, playing, the, stick, head, or, shaft, directly, at, the, ball, to, increase, the, effectiveness, of, the, tackle, players, will, often, place, the, entire, stick, close, to, the, ground, horizontally, thus, representing, a, wider, barrier, to, avoid, the, tackle, the, ball, carrier, will, either, pass, the, ball, to, a, teammate, using, any, of, the, push, flick, or, hit, strokes, or, attempt, to, maneuver, or, drag, the, ball, around, the, tackle, trying, to, deceive, the, tackler, in, recent, years, the, penalty, corner, has, gained, importance, as, a, goal, scoring, opportunity, particularly, with, the, technical, development, of, the, drag, flick, tactics, at, penalty, corners, to, set, up, time, for, a, shot, with, a, drag, flick, or, a, hit, shot, at, the, goal, involve, various, complex, plays, including, multiple, passes, before, deflections, towards, the, goal, is, made, but, the, most, common, method, of, shooting, is, the, direct, flick, or, hit, at, the, goal, at, the, highest, level, field, hockey, is, a, fast, moving, highly, skilled, game, with, players, using, fast, moves, with, the, stick, quick, accurate, passing, and, hard, hits, in, attempts, to, keep, possession, and, move, the, ball, towards, the, goal, tackling, with, physical, contact, and, otherwise, physically, obstructing, players, is, not, permitted, some, of, the, tactics, used, resemble, football, soccer, but, with, greater, ball, speed, with, the, 2009, changes, to, the, rules, regarding, free, hits, in, the, attacking, 23, m, area, the, common, tactic, of, hitting, the, ball, hard, into, the, circle, was, forbidden, although, at, higher, levels, this, was, considered, tactically, risky, and, low, percentage, at, creating, scoring, opportunities, it, was, used, with, some, effect, to, win, penalty, corners, by, forcing, the, ball, onto, a, defender, s, foot, or, to, deflect, high, and, dangerously, off, a, defender, s, stick, the, fih, felt, it, was, a, dangerous, practice, that, could, easily, lead, to, raised, deflections, and, injuries, in, the, circle, which, is, often, crowded, at, a, free, hit, situation, and, outlawed, it, the, biggest, two, field, hockey, tournaments, are, the, olympic, games, tournament, and, the, hockey, world, cup,
