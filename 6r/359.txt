while, distances, between, bases, of, 60, feet, are, standard, across, varieties, the, pitcher, s, plate, ranges, from, 35, to, 43, feet, away, from, home, plate, and, the, home, run, fence, can, be, 220, to, 300, feet, away, from, home, plate, the, ball, itself, is, typically, 11, or, 12, inches, 28, or, 30, centimetres, in, circumference, though, this, also, depends, on, specifics, of, the, competition, softball, rules, vary, in, certain, aspects, from, those, of, baseball, the, game, moves, at, a, faster, pace, than, traditional, baseball, due, to, the, field, being, smaller, and, the,

cm, ball, used, by, the, farragut, club, and, eventually, the, minneapolis, ball, prevailed, although, the, dimensions, of, the, minneapolis, diamond, were, passed, over, in, favor, of, the, dimensions, of, the, chicago, one, rober, may, not, have, been, familiar, with, the, farragut, club, rules, fire, station, no, 19, in, minneapolis, rober, s, post, from, 1896, to, 1906, was, listed,

ten, players, on, a, field, at, once, from, one, team, on, the, field, at, a, time, slow, pitch, softball, is, played, with, ten, fielders, but, can, be, played, with, nine, if, needed, the, softball, field, is, usually, composed, of, a, dirt, or, brick, dust, infield, that, contains, the, shape, and, running, areas, of, a, diamond, and, a, grass, outfield, however, the, field, can, consist, of, other, solid, and, dry, surfaces, such, as, artificial, turf, or, asphalt, there, are, four, bases, on, the, infield, first, base, second, base, third, base, and, home, plate, the, bases, are, arranged, in, a, square, and, are, typically, 60, feet, 18, m, apart, near, the, center, of, this, square, is, the, pitcher, s, circle, and, within, the, circle, is, the, rubber, a, small, flat, rectangular, plate, a, foot, and, a, half, in, length, the, rubber, distance, from, the, plate, in, fastpitch, can, be, as, short, as, 35, feet, for, 10u, players, up, to, 43, feet, for, ages, 14, and, older, in, slow, pitch, softball, the, rubber, distance, can, be, 43, 46, or, 50, feet, depending, on, age, level, and, the, league, one, is, playing, in, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, score, more, runs, points, than, the, other, team, by, batting, hitting, a, ball, into, play, and, running, around, the, bases, touching, each, one, in, succession, the, ball, is, a, sphere, of, light, material, covered, with, leather, or, synthetic, material, it, is, 11, to, 12, inches, 28, 30, cm, or, rarely, 16, in, or, 41, cm, in, circumference, the, game, is, officiated, by, one, or, more, neutral, umpires, players, and, umpires, are, generally, free, to, ask, for, a, brief, stoppage, at, any, time, when, the, ball, is, not, in, play, called, a, time, out, or, immediately, following, a, play, once, its, outcome, is, clear, the, game, is, played, in, usually, seven, innings, each, inning, is, divided, into, a, top, half, in, which, the, away, team, bats, and, tries, to, score, runs, while, the, home, team, occupies, the, field, and, tries, to, record, three, outs, then, a, bottom, half, when, the, teams, roles, are, reversed, some, leagues, play, with, a, reduced, number, of, innings, or, with, a, time, limit, rather, than, the, traditional, seven, innings, to, start, play, the, offense, sends, a, batter, to, home, plate, the, batting, order, must, be, fixed, at, the, start, of, the, game, and, players, may, not, bat, out, of, turn, the, defense, s, pitcher, stands, atop, the, rubber, and, pitches, the, ball, towards, home, plate, using, an, underhand, motion, in, fast, pitch, the, pitcher, is, allowed, to, take, one, step, back, prior, to, releasing, the, ball, during, the, forward, movement, the, batter, attempts, to, hit, the, pitched, ball, with, a, bat, a, long, round, smooth, stick, made, of, wood, metal, or, composite, if, the, pitcher, throws, three, strikes, against, a, batter, then, the, batter, is, out, and, the, next, batter, in, the, order, comes, up, to, bat, a, strike, is, recorded, any, time, a, batter, swings, at, and, misses, a, pitch, or, when, a, batter, hits, a, ball, foul, out, of, play, a, strike, is, also, recorded, any, time, the, batter, does, not, swing, at, a, pitch, that, crosses, home, plate, within, an, area, known, as, the, strike, zone, in, fast, pitch, to, be, within, the, strike, zone, the, pitch, must, cross, over, home, plate, and, as, it, crosses, it, must, be, above, the, knees, and, slightly, below, the, shoulders, roughly, the, armpit, or, the, shirt, logo, the, strike, zone, therefore, varies, from, batter, to, batter, in, slow, pitch, the, ball, must, land, on, a, carpet, or, marked, area, behind, the, plate, therefore, standardizing, the, strike, zone, a, pitch, outside, the, strike, zone, is, a, ball, if, the, batter, reaches, four, balls, the, batter, is, awarded, the, first, base, in, what, is, known, as, a, walk, the, umpire, behind, home, plate, is, the, sole, arbiter, of, balls, and, strikes, a, foul, ball, may, or, may, not, result, in, a, strikeout, dependent, upon, what, association, and, local, league, rules, however, bunting, a, foul, ball, does, result, in, a, strikeout, in, some, associations, and, leagues, bunting, is, not, allowed, and, results, in, an, out, also, if, a, player, has, two, strikes, swinging, and, partially, hitting, the, ball, can, result, in, an, out, if, the, catcher, manages, to, catch, the, tipped, ball, the, batter, attempts, to, swing, the, bat, and, hit, the, ball, fair, into, the, field, of, play, after, a, successful, hit, the, batter, becomes, a, base, runner, or, runner, and, must, run, to, first, base, the, defense, attempts, to, field, the, ball, and, may, throw, the, ball, freely, between, players, so, one, player, can, field, the, ball, while, another, moves, to, a, position, to, put, out, the, runner, the, defense, can, tag, the, runner, by, touching, the, runner, with, the, ball, while, the, runner, is, not, on, a, base, the, defense, can, also, touch, first, base, while, in, possession, of, the, ball, in, this, case, it, is, sufficient, to, beat, the, batter, to, first, base, and, an, actual, tag, of, the, batter, is, unnecessary, a, runner, is, said, to, be, thrown, out, when, the, play, involves, two, or, more, defensive, players, runners, generally, cannot, be, put, out, when, touching, a, base, but, only, one, runner, may, occupy, a, base, at, any, time, and, runners, may, not, pass, each, other, when, a, ball, is, batted, into, play, runners, generally, must, attempt, to, advance, if, there, are, no, open, bases, behind, them, for, example, a, runner, on, first, base, must, run, to, second, base, if, the, batter, puts, the, ball, in, play, in, such, a, situation, the, defense, can, throw, to, the, base, that, the, lead, runner, is, attempting, to, take, a, force, out, and, the, defense, can, then, also, throw, to, the, previous, base, this, can, result, in, a, multiple, out, play, a, double, play, is, two, outs, while, a, triple, play, a, very, rare, occurrence, is, three, outs, runners, with, an, open, base, behind, them, are, not, forced, to, advance, and, do, so, at, their, own, risk, the, defense, must, tag, such, runners, directly, to, put, them, out, rather, than, tagging, the, base, a, ball, hit, in, the, air, and, caught, before, hitting, the, ground, in, fair, or, foul, territory, puts, the, batter, out, a, fly, ball, is, a, ball, hit, high, and, deep, a, pop, fly, is, a, ball, hit, high, but, short, and, a, line, drive, is, a, ball, hit, close, to, the, horizontal, after, the, catch, runners, must, return, to, their, original, bases, if, the, defense, throws, the, ball, to, that, base, before, the, runner, returns, the, runner, is, out, as, well, resulting, in, a, double, play, a, runner, who, remains, on, the, base, until, the, ball, is, touched, or, returns, to, the, base, tags, up, after, the, catch, may, try, to, advance, to, the, next, base, at, the, risk, of, being, tagged, out, between, bases, as, in, baseball, the, infield, fly, rule, applies, in, some, game, situations, to, prevent, the, defense, from, recording, multiple, force, outs, by, deliberately, dropping, an, easy, catch, offensive, strategy, is, mostly, just, to, hit, the, ball, skillfully, to, let, the, batter, reach, base, and, advance, other, runners, around, the, bases, to, score, runs, the, count, of, balls, and, strikes, indicates, how, aggressive, the, batter, should, be, the, offense, may, try, to, sacrifice, with, the, batter, deliberately, making, an, out, in, order, to, advance, runners, defensive, strategy, is, more, complex, as, particular, situations, number, of, outs, and, positions, of, base, runners, and, particular, batters, call, for, different, positioning, of, fielders, and, different, tactical, decisions, the, defense, may, decide, to, allow, a, run, if, it, can, achieve, one, or, multiple, outs, the, playing, field, is, divided, into, fair, territory, and, foul, territory, fair, territory, is, further, divided, into, the, infield, and, the, outfield, the, field, is, defined, by, foul, lines, that, meet, at, a, right, angle, at, home, plate, the, minimum, length, of, the, baselines, varies, classification, of, play, see, below, for, official, measurements, a, fence, running, between, the, baselines, defines, the, limits, of, the, field, distance, from, home, plate, to, the, fence, varies, by, field, the, widest, part, of, the, field, is, the, distance, between, the, foul, poles, which, are, erected, where, the, foul, lines, meet, the, fence, and, are, about, 310, to, 420, feet, 94, to, 128, m, apart, depending, on, the, length, of, the, foul, lines, home, plate, is, one, corner, of, a, diamond, with, bases, at, each, corner, the, bases, are, cushions, 15, inches, 38, cm, square, of, canvas, or, a, similar, material, and, not, more, than, 5, inches, 13, cm, thick, the, bases, are, usually, securely, fastened, to, the, ground, the, bases, are, numbered, counterclockwise, as, first, base, second, base, and, third, base, often, but, not, always, outside, first, base, that, is, in, foul, territory, and, adjacent, and, connected, to, it, there, is, a, contrast, colored, double, base, or, safety, base, intended, to, prevent, collisions, between, the, first, baseman, and, the, runner, the, runner, runs, for, the, foul, portion, of, the, double, base, after, hitting, the, ball, while, the, fielding, team, tries, to, throw, the, ball, to, the, fair, portion, before, the, runner, reaches, the, safety, base, however, not, all, softball, diamonds, have, these, safety, bases, and, they, are, much, more, common, in, women, s, softball, than, in, men, s, the, double, base, is, required, in, the, u, 18, women, s, softball, world, cup, the, infield, consists, of, the, diamond, and, the, adjacent, space, in, which, the, infielders, see, below, normally, play, the, outfield, is, the, remaining, space, between, the, baselines, and, between, the, outfield, fence, and, the, infield, the, infield, is, usually, skinned, dirt, while, the, outfield, has, grass, in, regulation, competitions, near, the, center, of, the, diamond, is, the, pitching, plate, or, colloquially, rubber, in, fastpitch, a, circle, 16, feet, 4, 9, meters, in, diameter, known, as, the, pitching, circle, is, marked, around, the, pitching, plate, a, field, is, officially, required, to, have, a, warning, track, between, 15, and, 12, feet, 4, 6, and, 3, 7, meters, from, the, outfield, fence, however, if, the, game, is, being, played, on, a, field, larger, than, required, no, warning, track, is, required, before, the, temporary, outfield, fencing, located, in, foul, territory, outside, both, baselines, are, two, coach, s, boxes, each, box, is, behind, a, line, 15, feet, 4, 6, meters, long, located, 12, feet, 3, 7, meters, from, each, baseline, equipment, required, in, softball, includes, a, ball, a, bat, composite, metal, or, wooden, gloves, uniforms, and, protective, gear, for, example, helmets, for, the, offensive, team, and, a, helmet, shin, guards, and, chest, protector, for, the, defensive, catcher, also, cleats, sliding, shorts, face, masks, and, knee, sliders, may, be, worn, for, softball, despite, the, sport, s, name, the, ball, is, not, actually, soft, though, it, does, have, a, lower, density, and, greater, coefficient, of, restitution, than, a, baseball, the, size, of, the, ball, varies, according, to, the, variety, played, and, age, of, the, participants, the, circumference, for, fastpitch, for, adults, is, 12, 0, 125, in, 30, 5, 0, 3, cm, with, a, mass, between, 6, 25, and, 7, 0, oz, 177, and, 198, g, while, children, under, 12, use, a, ball, with, a, circumference, of, 11, 0, 125, in, 27, 9, 0, 3, cm, with, a, mass, between, 5, 875, and, 6, 125, oz, 166, 6, and, 173, 6, g, a, 12, inch, circumference, ball, is, generally, used, in, slow, pitch, for, comparison, a, baseball, is, 9, to, 9, 1, 4, inches, 229, 235, mm, in, circumference, and, has, a, mass, between, 5, and, 5, 1, 4, ounces, 142, 149, g, the, ball, is, covered, in, two, pieces, of, leather, or, similar, synthetic, covering, that, are, roughly, the, shape, of, a, figure, 8, and, sewn, together, along, a, continuous, seam, the, core, of, the, ball, may, be, made, of, long, fiber, kapok, a, mixture, of, cork, and, rubber, a, polyurethane, mixture, or, another, approved, material, before, 1993, white, balls, were, standard, at, all, levels, of, play, in, that, year, a, new, fluorescent, optic, yellow, colored, ball, was, first, used, in, college, softball, yellow, softballs, have, become, the, standard, for, all, levels, of, play, white, balls, are, also, still, allowed, but, are, very, uncommon, today, in, chicago, where, softball, was, invented, it, remains, traditional, to, play, a, variant, of, slow, pitch, with, a, ball, 16, inches, 41, centimeters, in, circumference, the, fielders, do, not, wear, gloves, or, mitts, a, 16, inch, softball, when, new, is, rough, and, hard, with, hand, and, finger, injuries, to, fielders, frequent, if, they, do, not, give, when, receiving, a, ball, but, the, ball, breaks, in, slightly, during, a, game, and, continues, to, soften, over, time, with, continued, play, a, well, broken, in, ball, is, called, a, mush, ball, and, is, favored, for, informal, pick, up, games, and, when, playing, in, limited, space, such, as, a, city, street, because, the, ball, does, not, go, as, far, a, 16, inch, ball, is, also, used, for, wheelchair, softball, the, bat, used, by, the, batter, can, be, made, of, wood, aluminum, or, composite, materials, such, as, carbon, fiber, sizes, may, vary, but, they, may, be, no, more, than, 34, inches, 86, cm, long, 2, 4, inches, 6, cm, in, diameter, or, 38, ounces, 1, 1, kg, in, mass, the, standard, barrel, diameter, for, both, slow, pitch, and, fast, pitch, softball, bats, is, 2, 1, 4, inches, many, players, prefer, a, smaller, barrel, which, reduces, mass, and, allows, higher, swing, speed, although, there, are, a, variety, of, bats, used, there, are, several, that, are, banned, due, to, performance, enhancement, for, example, with, a, thinner, wall, the, ball, recoils, faster, off, the, bat, allowing, it, to, travel, further, many, bats, may, be, doctored, or, juiced, by, being, end, loaded, shaved, or, painted, end, loading, of, a, cap, refers, to, the, addition, of, weight, manually, placed, at, the, end, of, the, barrel, to, distribute, more, weight, at, the, tip, shaving, bats, require, machine, use, in, order, to, remove, the, inner, walls, of, the, bat, to, improve, elasticity, lastly, illegal, bats, may, be, painted, to, resemble, legal, ones, all, defensive, players, wear, fielding, gloves, made, of, leather, or, similar, material, gloves, have, webbing, between, the, thumb, and, forefinger, known, as, the, pocket,

never, more, than, one, plate, umpire, there, can, be, up, to, three, base, umpires, and, up, to, a, further, three, umpires, positioned, in, the, outfield, most, fastpitch, games, use, a, crew, of,

each, other, and, a, verbal, call, of, safe, out, calls, are, made, by, raising, the, right, hand, in, a, clenched, fist, with, a, verbal, call, of, out, strikes, are, called, by, the, plate, umpire, who, uses, the, same, motion, as, the, out, call, with, a, verbal, call, of, strike, balls, are, only, called, verbally, with, no, hand, gesture, the, umpire, also, has, the, option, of, not, saying, anything, on, a, ball, it, is, understood, that, when, he, stands, up, the, pitch, was, not, a, strike, foul, balls, are, called, by, extending, both, arms, up, in, the, air, with, a, verbal, call, of, foul, ball, while, fair, balls, are, indicated, only, by, pointing, towards, fair, territory, with, no, verbal, call, no, signal, is, given, for, balls, that, are, obviously, foul, for, closer, calls, that, are, not, borderline, a, signal, is, given, all, decisions, made, by, the, umpire, s, are, considered, to, be, final, only, decisions, where, a, rule, might, have, been, misinterpreted, are, considered, to, be, protest, able, at, some, tournaments, there, might, be, a, rules, interpreter, or, tournament, chief, umpire, tcu, also, known, as, the, umpire, in, chief, or, uic, available, to, pass, judgment, on, such, protests, but, it, is, usually, up, to, the, league, or, association, involved, to, decide, if, the, protest, would, be, upheld, protests, are, never, allowed, on, what, are, considered, judgment, calls, balls, strikes, and, fouls, as, of, the, 2021, 22, academic, year, a, coach, of, a, ncaa, team, is, allowed, to, protest, a, call, made, by, the, umpire, through, what, is, called, video, review, during, the, game, the, opposing, team, only, has, until, the, next, pitch, to, initiate, the, protest, and, they, are, only, allowed, two, a, game, a, softball, game, can, last, anywhere, from, 3, to, 7, innings, or, 1, 2, hours, depending, on, the, league, rules, and, type, of, softball, the, teams, take, turns, batting, officially, which, team, bats, first, is, decided, by, a, coin, toss, although, a, league, may, decide, otherwise, at, its, discretion, the, most, common, rule, is, that, the, home, team, bats, second, batting, second, is, also, called, last, at, bat, many, softball, players, prefer, to, bat, second, because, they, feel, they, have, more, control, in, the, last, inning, since, they, have, the, last, at, bat, in, the, event, of, a, tie, extra, innings, are, usually, played, until, the, tie, is, broken, except, in, certain, tournaments, and, championships, if, the, home, team, is, leading, and, the, road, team, has, just, finished, its, half, of, the, seventh, inning, the, game, ends, because, it, is, not, necessary, for, the, home, team, to, bat, again, in, all, forms, of, softball, the, defensive, team, is, the, fielding, team, the, offensive, team, is, at, bat, or, batting, and, is, trying, to, score, runs, play, often, but, not, always, begins, with, the, umpire, saying, play, ball, after, the, batter, is, ready, and, all, fielders, except, the, catcher, are, in, fair, territory, at, their, respective, positions, the, pitcher, stands, at, the, pitching, plate, and, attempts, to, throw, the, ball, past, the, batter, to, the, catcher, behind, home, plate, the, throw, or, pitch, must, be, made, with, an, underhand, motion, the, pitcher, throws, the, ball, in, or, around, the, strike, zone, however, in, advanced, play, pitcher, and, catcher, play, a, psychological, game, trying, to, get, the, batter, to, guess, where, the, next, pitch, is, going, and, if, it, will, be, a, strike, in, other, instances, such, as, when, an, extremely, powerful, hitter, comes, up, to, bat, and, they, are, followed, by, a, weaker, hitter, a, pitcher, may, deliberately, walk, the, first, batter, based, on, the, calculation, that, the, next, batter, will, be, an, easy, out, the, strike, zone, is, slightly, different, in, different, forms, of, softball, a, pitch, that, passes, through, that, zone, is, a, strike, a, pitch, at, which, the, batter, swings, is, also, a, strike, as, is, any, hit, ball, that, lands, in, foul, territory, that, is, not, caught, out, a, pitch, that, is, not, a, strike, and, at, which, the, batter, does, not, swing, is, known, as, a, ball, the, number, of, balls, and, strikes, is, called, the, count, the, number, of, balls, is, always, given, first, as, 2, and, 1, 2, and, 2, and, so, on, a, count, of, 3, and, 2, is, a, full, count, since, the, next, ball, or, strike, will, end, the, batter, s, turn, at, the, plate, unless, the, ball, goes, foul, in, most, versions, of, slow, pitch, including, 16, inch, the, pitch, is, lobbed, so, that, the, ball, rises, above, the, batter, s, head, and, lands, on, a, small, rectangular, area, on, the, ground, behind, the, plate, called, the, well, umpires, will, make, calls, based, on, where, the, ball, lands, behind, the, plate, a, pitch, landing, in, the, well, is, a, strike, these, restrictions, make, it, much, easier, to, put, the, ball, into, play, and, extremely, difficult, to, use, pitching, as, a, defensive, strategy, as, the, physics, of, projectile, motion, limit, how, fast, a, ball, can, be, thrown, under, such, conditions, and, still, be, called, a, strike, in, other, varieties, of, slow, pitch, sometimes, known, as, modified, the, only, restriction, is, that, the, windmill, cannot, be, used, thus, the, pitching, arm, cannot, be, raised, above, the, shoulder, and, both, the, wind, up, and, the, release, must, be, underhand, still, allowing, for, moderate, speed, and, control, in, pitching, for, fastpitch, softball, the, traditional, pitching, style, is, a, windmill, motion, extending, the, arm, above, the, body, and, releasing, the, ball, at, about, hip, level, at, maximum, speeds, strength, acquired, in, the, underhand, windmill, motion, is, based, on, the, open, to, close, hip, motion, pitches, may, reach, high, speeds, in, women, s, fastpitch, depending, on, the, age, group, pitchers, can, throw, from, 30, to, 65, mph, 48, to, 105, km, h, or, more, the, fastest, pitch, ever, recorded, was, at, 77, mph, 124, km, h, by, monica, abbott, on, june, 16, 2012, at, the, 1996, summer, olympics, one, pitch, reached, 73, 3, mph, 118, 0, km, h, male, pitching, can, reach, speeds, around, 85, mph, 137, km, h, to, compare, mlb, players, average, around, 90, mph, 140, km, h, but, can, reach, speeds, up, to, 100, mph, 160, km, h, although, slower, than, baseball, pitches, the, shorter, pitching, distance, in, fastpitch, results, in, batters, having, a, comparable, time, to, react, to, a, pitch, as, in, baseball, throwing, fastballs, for, speed, is, not, always, the, most, important, factor, in, fastpitch, softball, pitchers, can, throw, breaking, balls, that, move, late, in, their, flight, fooling, batters, into, swinging, at, pitches, outside, the, strike, zone, or, conversely, not, swinging, at, pitches, that, pass, through, the, strike, zone, these, include, balls, that, break, inwards, screwball, and, outwards, curveball, on, right, handed, batters, starting, off, the, plate, and, moving, into, the, strike, zone, or, starting, towards, the, strike, zone, and, moving, off, the, plate, there, are, also, rise, balls, that, break, upwards, frequently, starting, in, the, strike, zone, and, ending, above, it, and, drop, balls, that, break, downward, another, common, pitch, is, the, change, up, an, intentionally, slow, pitch, that, initially, appears, to, be, a, fastball, causing, the, batter, to, swing, too, early, and, miss, or, foul, off, the, pitch, rarer, is, the, knuckleball, which, moves, slowly, and, erratically, pitchers, use, deception, as, a, primary, tactic, for, getting, batters, out, as, the, reaction, times, are, approximately, half, a, second, or, less, at, higher, levels, of, play, pitchers, aim, for, the, inner, and, outer, corners, of, the, plate, when, throwing, fastballs, and, breaking, pitches, pitchers, also, vary, the, location, of, the, pitch, by, height, to, make, hitting, the, ball, even, harder, for, the, batter, pitchers, also, throw, knuckleballs, which, are, generally, slower, and, move, erratically, a, crow, hop, is, an, illegal, pitch, that, occurs, when, the, pitcher, pushes, with, the, pivot, foot, from, somewhere, other, than, the, pitching, plate, this, often, involves, jumping, from, the, pitching, plate, and, replanting, somewhere, in, front, of, the, pitching, plate, for, an, illegal, pitch, the, umpire, extends, his, left, arm, straight, out, to, the, side, and, clenches, his, fist, this, results, in, a, ball, being, awarded, to, the, batter, and, any, runners, on, base, advancing, to, the, next, base, if, the, batter, swings, at, the, pitch, that, is, deemed, illegal, and, puts, the, ball, in, play, the, offense, is, given, the, option, to, accept, the, results, of, the, play, or, accept, the, penalty, listed, previously, exception, if, the, play, results, in, the, batter, and, any, runners, all, advancing, at, least, one, base, the, play, stands, and, no, option, is, given, the, image, to, the, right, demonstrates, a, legal, pitch, as, the, push, off, foot, has, not, left, the, ground, the, ball, must, be, released, simultaneously, with, the, lead, leg, step, the, offensive, team, sends, one, batter, at, a, time, to, home, plate, to, use, the, bat, to, try, to, hit, the, pitch, forward, into, fair, territory, the, order, the, players, bat, in, known, as, the, batting, order, must, stay, the, same, throughout, the, game, substitutes, and, replacements, must, bat, in, the, same, position, as, the, player, they, are, replacing, in, co, ed, male, and, female, batters, must, alternate, the, batter, stands, facing, the, pitcher, inside, a, batter, s, box, there, is, one, on, each, side, of, the, plate, to, compensate, for, either, right, or, left, handed, batters, the, bat, is, held, with, both, hands, over, the, shoulder, and, away, from, the, pitcher, 90, degree, angle, the, ball, is, usually, hit, with, a, full, swinging, motion, in, which, the, bat, may, move, through, more, than, 360, degrees, the, batter, usually, steps, forward, with, the, front, foot, the, body, weight, shifts, forward, as, the, batter, simultaneously, swings, the, bat, a, bunt, is, another, form, of, batting, there, are, different, types, including, a, sacrifice, bunt, or, slap, bunt, there, is, also, regular, slapping, in, which, a, batter, takes, position, on, the, left, side, of, the, plate, and, usually, stands, in, the, back, of, the, box, but, it, is, possible, form, anywhere, the, batter, takes, a, step, back, with, their, leading, foot, as, the, pitcher, is, in, the, middle, of, the, windup, crosses, over, with, their, back, foot, and, runs, toward, first, base, while, they, swing, there, are, many, different, types, of, slapping, and, they, all, vary, depending, on, the, batter, and, their, strengths, there, are, half, swing, slaps, fake, slaps, and, full, swing, slaps, each, type, of, slap, has, a, different, purpose, or, goal, no, matter, what, way, the, batter, hits, the, ball, they, must, be, inside, the, batter, s, box, when, the, bat, makes, contact, with, the, ball, if, the, batter, steps, out, of, the, box, while, swinging, the, batter, is, out, once, the, ball, is, hit, into, fair, territory, the, runner, must, try, to, advance, to, first, base, or, beyond, while, running, to, first, base, the, batter, is, a, batter, runner, when, she, safely, reaches, first, see, below, she, becomes, a, base, runner, or, runner, a, batted, ball, hit, high, in, the, air, is, a, fly, ball, a, fly, ball, hit, upward, at, an, angle, greater, than, 45, degrees, is, a, pop, fly, a, batted, ball, driven, in, the, air, through, the, infield, at, a, height, at, which, an, infielder, could, play, it, if, in, the, right, position, is, a, line, drive, a, batted, ball, which, hits, the, ground, within, the, diamond, is, a, ground, ball, if, a, batted, ball, hits, a, player, or, a, base, it, is, considered, to, have, hit, the, ground, a, batter, can, also, advance, to, first, if, hit, by, the, pitch, if, a, batter, is, hit, by, the, pitch, it, is, a, dead, ball, and, she, is, rewarded, first, base, she, must, make, an, attempt, to, get, out, of, the, way, and, it, is, the, umpire, s, judgmental, call, whether, the, batter, attempted, to, move, if, he, feels, the, batter, could, have, moved, and, avoided, getting, hit, he, or, she, will, not, reward, the, batter, first, base, and, the, pitch, will, be, recorded, as, a, ball, the, batter, is, out, if, the, batter, accrues, three, strikes, a, strikeout, a, ball, hit, by, the, batter, is, caught, before, touching, the, ground, a, flyout, the, batter, goes, to, a, base, that, is, already, tagged, tagged, or, tag, play, a, fielder, holding, the, ball, touches, a, base, which, is, the, only, base, towards, which, the, batter, may, run, before, the, batter, arrives, there, a, force, out, or, force, play, or, in, certain, special, circumstances, there, is, also, a, not, so, common, occurrence, when, the, batter, has, two, strikes, and, swings, at, strike, three, if, the, catcher, does, not, catch, the, ball, the, batter, has, the, chance, to, run, to, first, base, and, the, catcher, can, throw, the, batter, out, at, first, base, if, the, player, hits, the, ball, and, advances, to, a, base, without, a, fielding, error, or, an, out, being, recorded, then, that, is, called, a, base, hit, the, bases, must, be, reached, in, order, counterclockwise, starting, with, first, base, after, hitting, the, ball, the, batter, may, advance, as, many, bases, as, possible, an, advance, to, first, base, on, the, one, hit, is, a, single, to, second, base, is, a, double, to, third, base, is, a, triple, and, to, home, plate, is, a, home, run, home, runs, are, usually, scored, by, hitting, the, ball, over, the, outfield, fence, but, may, be, scored, on, a, hit, which, does, not, go, over, the, fence, a, home, run, includes, any, ball, that, bounces, off, a, fielder, and, goes, over, the, fence, in, fair, territory, depending, upon, association, and, local, league, rules, or, that, hits, the, foul, pole, if, a, batted, ball, bounces, off, a, fielder, in, fair, territory, and, goes, over, the, fence, in, foul, territory, or, if, it, goes, over, the, fence, at, a, location, that, is, closer, than, the, official, distance, the, batter, is, awarded, a, double, instead, if, a, runner, becomes, entitled, to, the, base, where, another, runner, is, standing, the, latter, runner, must, advance, to, the, next, base, for, example, if, a, player, hits, the, ball, and, there, is, a, runner, on, first, the, runner, on, first, must, try, to, advance, to, second, because, the, batter, runner, is, entitled, to, first, base, if, the, batter, reaches, first, base, without, being, put, out, then, that, player, can, then, be, forced, to, run, towards, second, base, the, next, time, a, ball, is, driven, into, fair, territory, that, is, because, the, player, must, vacate, first, base, to, allow, the, next, batter, to, reach, it, and, consequently, can, only, go, to, second, base, where, a, force, out, may, be, recorded, runners, may, advance, at, risk, to, be, put, out, on, a, hit, by, another, player, after, a, fly, ball, has, been, caught, provided, the, player, was, touching, a, base, at, the, time, the, ball, was, first, touched, or, after, or, in, fastpitch, automatically, when, a, pitch, is, delivered, illegally, runners, advance, without, liability, to, be, put, out, when, a, walk, advances, another, player, to, the, runner, s, current, base, or, automatically, in, certain, special, circumstances, described, below, in, the, recent, years, the, ncaa, rules, changed, when, concerning, the, batters, feet, while, in, the, box, the, rule, now, states, that, as, long, as, any, part, of, the, batter, s, foot, is, in, the, box, the, ball, will, stay, live, it, is, not, until, the, batter, s, entire, foot, is, out, of, the, box, that, the, play, will, be, declared, dead, and, the, batter, called, out, the, sec, college, ball, however, claims, that, if, any, part, of, the, batter, s, foot, is, out, of, the, box, when, she, makes, contact, she, is, out, and, the, play, is, dead, if, there, is, a, wild, throw, or, overthrow, in, which, the, ball, goes, out, of, the, designated, play, area, each, runner, is, awarded, two, bases, from, the, last, base, touched, at, the, time, of, the, throw, retreating, past, a, made, base, negates, the, advance, to, that, base, if, a, fielder, intentionally, carries, a, ball, out, of, play, two, bases, are, awarded, from, the, time, the, ball, leaves, the, field, of, play, if, this, is, unintentional, fielder, s, momentum, the, award, is, one, base, if, on, a, tag, play, the, fielder, loses, control, after, establishing, control, of, the, ball, and, it, leaves, the, field, of, play, one, base, is, awarded, if, there, is, a, wild, pitch, in, which, the, ball, goes, out, of, the, designated, play, area, each, runner, is, awarded, one, base, from, the, base, occupied, at, the, time, of, the, pitch, in, fastpitch, runners, may, try, to, steal, bases, by, running, to, the, next, base, on, the, pitch, and, reaching, it, before, being, tagged, with, the, ball, the, point, at, which, a, runner, can, steal, a, base, varies, in, fastpitch, the, runner, is, allowed, to, begin, stealing, a, base, when, the, ball, is, released, from, the, windmill, pitching, motion, but, until, recently, stealing, was, forbidden, in, slow, pitch, because, a, runner, has, the, opportunity, to, get, a, larger, head, start, while, the, slow, pitch, is, making, its, way, to, the, batter, as, a, result, of, rule, changes, initiated, by, the, independent, softball, association, which, later, made, its, way, to, the, amateur, softball, association, and, the, international, softball, federation, in, the, 21st, century, most, levels, of, slow, pitch, permit, stealing, bases, provided, the, runner, starts, when, the, ball, either, touches, the, ground, or, crosses, the, plate, this, rule, encourages, pitchers, to, be, more, responsible, with, the, pitch, and, catchers, to, play, defense, as, balls, which, miss, the, catcher, are, now, grounds, to, have, stolen, bases, no, matter, what, level, of, play, all, baserunners, must, keep, one, foot, on, a, base, until, the, pitcher, throws, the, ball, or, until, the, ball, crosses, the, front, edge, of, home, plate, depends, on, association, in, fastpitch, if, the, catcher, drops, strike, three, a, passed, ball, with, no, less, than, two, outs, the, batter, can, attempt, to, run, to, first, base, if, first, base, is, unoccupied, the, catcher, must, then, attempt, to, throw, the, ball, to, first, base, ahead, of, the, runner, if, he, or, she, cannot, the, runner, is, safe, with, two, outs, the, batter, can, attempt, to, run, to, first, whether, or, not, it, is, already, occupied, depending, on, the, league, in, slow, pitch, only, a, foul, ball, with, two, strikes, on, the, batter, means, the, batter, is, out, stealing, in, 16, inch, softball, is, severely, restricted, as, a, runner, may, only, steal, the, base, in, front, of, them, if, it, is, open, and, if, they, are, thrown, at, la, pickoff, move, or, snap, throw, this, results, in, many, inexperienced, players, being, thrown, or, doubled, off, when, they, attempt, to, advance, on, a, wild, pickoff, at, another, baserunner, a, run, is, scored, when, a, player, has, touched, all, four, bases, in, order, proceeding, counterclockwise, around, them, they, need, not, be, touched, on, the, same, play, a, batter, may, remain, safely, on, a, base, while, play, proceeds, and, attempt, to, advance, on, a, later, play, a, run, is, not, scored, if, the, last, out, is, a, force, out, or, occurs, during, the, same, play, that, the, runner, crosses, home, plate, for, instance, if, a, runner, is, on, third, base, prior, to, a, hit, and, he, or, she, crosses, home, plate, after, an, out, is, made, either, on, the, batter, or, another, runner, the, run, is, not, counted, the, team, with, the, most, runs, after, seven, innings, wins, the, game, the, last, bottom, half, of, the, seventh, inning, or, any, remaining, part, of, the, seventh, inning, is, not, played, if, the, team, batting, second, is, leading, if, the, game, is, tied, play, usually, continues, until, a, decision, is, reached, by, using, the, international, tie, breaker, rules, starting, in, the, top, of, first, extra, inning, the, batting, team, starts, with, a, baserunner, on, second, base, which, is, the, player, who, is, the, last, available, to, bat, in, other, words, the, batter, who, last, took, their, position, in, the, batter, s, box, regardless, whether, they, were, the, last, out, or, another, runner, was, put, out, in, games, where, one, team, leads, by, a, large, margin, the, run, ahead, rule, may, come, into, play, in, order, to, reduce, any, potential, embarrassment, of, weaker, teams, in, fastpitch, and, modified, pitch, a, margin, of, 15, runs, after, 3, innings, 10, after, 4, or, 7, after, 5, is, sufficient, for, the, leading, team, to, be, declared, the, winner, in, slow, pitch, the, margin, is, 20, runs, after, 4, innings, or, 15, after, 5, innings, in, the, ncaa, the, required, margin, after, 5, innings, is, 8, runs, the, mercy, rule, takes, effect, at, the, end, of, an, inning, thus, if, the, team, batting, first, is, ahead, by, enough, runs, for, the, rule, to, come, into, effect, the, team, batting, second, has, their, half, of, the, inning, to, narrow, the, margin, a, game, may, be, lost, due, to, a, forfeit, a, score, of, 7, 0, for, the, team, not, at, fault, is, recorded, generally, one, run, is, awarded, for, each, inning, that, would, have, been, played, a, forfeit, may, be, called, due, to, any, of, these, circumstances, if, a, team, does, not, show, up, to, play, if, one, side, refuses, to, continue, play, if, a, team, fails, to, resume, play, after, a, suspension, of, play, ends, if, a, team, uses, tactics, intended, to, unfairly, delay, or, hasten, the, game, if, a, player, removed, from, the, game, does, not, leave, within, one, minute, of, being, instructed, to, do, so, if, a, player, that, cannot, play, enters, the, game, and, one, pitch, has, been, thrown, if, a, team, does, not, have, for, whatever, reason, enough, players, to, continue, or, if, after, warning, by, the, umpire, a, player, continues, to, intentionally, break, the, rules, of, the, game, this, last, rule, is, rarely, enforced, as, players, who, break, rules, after, being, warned, are, usually, removed, the, plate, umpire, may, suspend, play, because, of, darkness, or, anything, that, puts, players, or, spectators, in, danger, if, four, innings, have, been, played, and, a, team, is, in, the, lead, the, game, is, recorded, as, it, stands, if, fewer, than, four, innings, have, been, played, the, game, is, not, considered, a, regulation, game, games, that, are, not, regulation, or, are, tied, when, suspended, are, resumed, from, the, point, of, suspension, if, it, is, a, championship, game, it, is, replayed, from, the, beginning, team, rosters, may, be, changed, there, are, nine, players, out, on, the, field, at, one, time, in, fastpitch, softball, and, ten, players, in, slow, pitch, softball, although, the, pitcher, and, catcher, have, the, ball, the, most, each, person, has, a, specific, job, in, the, infield, there, is, the, pitcher, catcher, first, baseman, second, baseman, shortstop, and, third, baseman, in, the, outfield, there, is, a, left, fielder, center, fielder, and, right, fielder, in, slow, pitch, softball, there, is, an, extra, outfielder, in, the, outfield, who, is, specified, as, a, roamer, or, rover, normally, the, defensive, team, will, play, with, four, outfielders, meaning, there, is, a, left, fielder, left, center, fielder, right, center, fielder, and, right, fielder, the, recent, trend, with, tournament, and, league, slow, pitch, softball, play, is, to, field, five, infielders, instead, of, four, outfielders, the, extra, infielder, is, commonly, placed, behind, the, pitcher, on, either, side, of, second, base, the, pitcher, is, the, individual, who, throws, the, ball, from, the, middle, of, the, diamond, as, in, baseball, fastpitch, softball, has, a, rubber, used, to, control, the, pitcher, s, delivery, a, pitcher, must, have, both, feet, on, the, rubber, at, the, start, of, their, delivery, but, neither, foot, is, on, the, rubber, when, the, ball, is, released, in, baseball, the, rubber, is, on, a, mound, of, dirt, as, gravity, is, used, to, generate, speed, in, softball, the, pitchers, throw, from, within, a, circle, and, the, rubber, in, the, circle, is, not, elevated, the, circle, is, also, used, to, control, base, runners, when, the, pitcher, is, in, possession, of, the, ball, in, the, circle, a, runner, who, has, passed, a, base, must, either, advance, or, return, to, the, base, they, cannot, bait, the, pitcher, to, throw, or, they, will, be, called, out, the, pitcher, tries, to, throw, the, ball, in, the, strike, zone, in, order, to, do, that, they, start, while, having, the, ball, in, their, glove, they, throw, their, arms, behind, their, hips, they, shoot, forwards, with, their, leg, which, is, on, the, same, side, as, their, glove, and, leave, their, glove, hand, there, and, the, other, arm, goes, around, the, shoulder, bends, the, elbow, and, turns, their, wrist, toward, the, third, baseman, and, brings, their, arm, through, at, the, end, flicks, their, wrist, which, affects, the, ball, s, speed, spin, and, subsequent, motion, and, brings, the, arm, up, with, the, hand, by, their, shoulder, they, follow, through, with, their, legs, turning, their, pitching, stance, into, a, fielding, stance, they, try, to, release, the, ball, when, they, go, past, their, hips, in, softball, the, pitcher, uses, an, underarm, motion, to, pitch, the, ball, towards, the, strike, zone, as, soon, as, the, pitcher, makes, a, throw, the, fielders, are, ready, to, field, balls, that, are, hit, in, the, middle, of, the, diamond, pitchers, usually, tend, to, be, tall, very, flexible, and, have, good, upper, body, strength, pitchers, can, be, righthanded, or, lefthanded, the, softball, pitcher, makes, a, windmill, motion, while, throwing, underhand, unlike, baseball, pitchers, who, throw, overhand, the, catcher, is, normally, behind, home, plate, in, a, squatted, position, some, plays, may, require, the, catcher, to, stand, at, an, angle, for, intentional, walks, at, the, plate, the, catcher, is, responsible, for, catching, pitches, keeping, mis, pitched, balls, in, front, of, the, plate, calling, pitches, that, are, normally, done, through, hand, signals, picking, off, runners, and, they, are, considered, the, leaders, of, the, field, catchers, must, know, how, many, outs, there, are, the, number, of, strikes, and, balls, on, the, batter, so, they, can, relay, that, to, their, teammates, they, must, also, know, how, many, runners, are, on, base, and, where, the, ball, should, be, thrown, next, in, the, following, play, catchers, are, strong, need, to, be, smart, and, quick, on, their, feet, and, have, accurate, throws, so, they, can, pick, runners, off, at, each, base, catchers, should, be, able, to, have, strong, and, muscular, legs, to, squat, for, a, long, period, of, time, the, gear, worn, by, a, catcher, protects, them, from, balls, thrown, in, the, dirt, or, wild, pitches, the, catcher, is, allowed, to, take, off, his, her, mask, to, catch, a, pop, fly, or, to, watch, the, play, the, first, baseman, is, the, position, to, the, left, side, of, the, diamond, when, facing, home, plate, the, major, role, of, the, first, baseman, is, to, receive, throws, from, other, defensive, players, in, order, to, get, a, force, play, at, first, base, another, role, they, play, is, to, make, fielding, plays, on, all, balls, hit, towards, first, base, the, first, baseman, is, usually, involved, in, every, play, that, occurs, on, the, field, individuals, at, first, base, have, quick, hands, and, good, reach, and, are, always, on, the, lookout, to, catch, the, player, off, base, they, are, also, generally, taller, and, left, handed, throwing, which, gives, them, an, extended, reach, first, basemen, however, can, be, both, left, and, right, handed, just, like, the, catcher, first, basemen, may, wear, specific, first, base, mitts, usually, having, a, longer, web, allowing, them, to, reach, the, taller, throws, over, their, head, the, second, baseman, plays, in, between, the, first, baseman, and, second, base, itself, usually, closer, to, second, base, if, the, ball, is, hit, to, the, left, side, of, the, field, the, second, baseman, covers, second, base, if, the, ball, is, hit, to, right, field, or, center, field, they, become, the, cut, off, for, the, center, fielder, or, the, right, fielder, depending, on, who, the, ball, was, hit, to, if, the, ball, is, hit, to, the, first, baseman, the, second, baseman, then, is, responsible, for, covering, first, if, the, ball, is, hit, to, the, second, baseman, they, either, throw, the, ball, to, second, if, there, was, already, a, player, on, first, or, they, throw, to, first, if, there, was, nobody, on, if, there, is, a, runner, on, first, and, the, person, up, to, bat, hits, the, ball, to, the, shortstop, or, the, third, baseman, the, second, baseman, is, in, charge, of, covering, second, to, receive, the, throw, from, the, shortstop, or, third, baseman, then, depending, on, where, the, runner, is, between, home, and, first, the, second, baseman, makes, the, decision, to, throw, the, ball, to, first, or, to, hold, the, ball, also, in, the, case, of, a, bunt, the, second, baseman, must, cover, first, as, the, first, baseman, runs, to, get, the, ball, from, the, bunt, then, it, is, often, thrown, back, to, first, base, the, shortstop, fields, all, balls, hit, to, the, infield, between, the, second, and, third, bases, this, individual, also, helps, cover, second, and, third, bases, is, frequently, involved, in, force, plays, and, double, plays, and, often, throws, the, ball, to, the, catcher, to, throw, out, runners, at, home, plate, on, steals, to, second, base, when, the, runner, from, first, is, advancing, to, second, on, the, pitch, the, shortstop, usually, covers, the, shortstop, does, not, cover, second, base, only, when, a, right, handed, batter, is, up, in, this, case, the, second, baseman, covers, the, steal, most, shortstops, are, very, quick, agile, and, think, fast, shortstops, may, play, in, a, restricted, zone, but, are, faced, with, many, types, of, hits, and, interact, closely, with, the, second, base, third, base, and, home, plate, often, double, plays, are, due, to, quick, thinking, reaction, by, the, shortstop, when, a, ball, is, hit, up, the, middle, and, the, shortstop, catches, it, they, will, flip, the, ball, to, the, second, baseman, for, the, best, result, shortstop, also, takes, the, cut, off, for, the, left, field, when, the, play, is, at, second, base, when, the, ball, is, hit, to, the, right, side, of, the, outfield, the, shortstop, then, covers, second, base, if, there, is, a, runner, on, first, base, and, there, is, a, hit, down, the, line, or, in, the, gap, to, right, field, the, shortstop, will, then, go, for, the, cut, to, third, meaning, the, runner, that, is, going, from, first, to, second, will, most, likely, be, advancing, to, third, and, in, that, case, the, shortstop, will, be, the, cut, off, for, the, throw, from, right, field, to, third, base, shortstop, can, be, one, of, the, most, difficult, positions, to, play, due, to, the, number, of, balls, being, hit, in, that, direction, the, third, baseman, is, the, position, on, the, right, side, of, the, diamond, when, you, are, facing, home, plate, they, are, responsible, for, fielding, all, balls, hit, their, way, including, bunts, in, fact, the, third, baseman, fields, more, bunts, than, a, pitcher, and, first, baseman, do, third, base, is, also, called, the, hot, corner, because, the, ball, can, pop, off, the, bat, at, the, fielder, very, fast, third, baseman, must, have, great, reflexes, and, be, very, quick, on, their, feet, because, not, only, to, they, need, to, be, quick, to, field, a, bunt, but, also, if, they, are, unable, to, predict, whether, the, batter, will, bunt, or, hit, a, ball, that, is, hit, may, be, a, line, drive, to, the, face, it, also, helps, if, they, can, run, fast, but, it, is, not, a, requirement, a, third, baseman, must, have, a, very, strong, arm, so, that, they, can, throw, a, runner, out, from, across, the, diamond, any, ball, that, the, third, baseman, can, get, they, should, they, will, have, more, momentum, towards, first, base, when, fielding, the, ball, than, a, shortstop, they, are, also, closer, to, first, base, when, they, cut, off, a, slower, ground, ball, towards, shortstop, third, baseman, are, responsible, for, covering, third, base, at, all, times, unless, the, ball, is, hit, to, them, in, that, instance, the, shortstop, is, responsible, for, third, base, third, baseman, must, be, smart, have, great, reflexes, have, a, strong, accurate, arm, and, be, quick, with, their, hands, the, outfielders, are, players, that, cover, the, grassy, area, behind, the, infield, outfielders, are, named, for, their, positions, in, the, field, relative, to, home, plate, traditional, outfield, positions, include, a, left, fielder, a, center, fielder, and, a, right, fielder, each, player, has, a, specific, job, as, being, an, outfielder, the, right, fielder, s, position, is, on, the, right, side, of, the, field, in, the, opening, between, the, first, and, second, basemen, when, looking, at, the, field, from, behind, home, plate, the, right, fielder, is, part, of, a, group, of, two, other, fielders, that, make, up, the, outfield, the, right, fielder, has, a, multitude, of, jobs, over, the, course, of, a, softball, game, generally, outfielders, act, as, a, back, up, to, the, infielders, when, they, make, plays, or, if, the, ball, is, hit, past, the, infield, right, field, has, a, particular, job, of, covering, the, area, behind, first, base, if, the, ball, is, to, be, thrown, in, that, area, right, field, is, meant, to, cover, this, area, if, the, ball, gets, past, the, first, baseman, this, will, prevent, base, runners, from, advancing, to, unwanted, bases, traditionally, in, the, game, of, softball, the, right, fielder, will, have, the, strongest, arm, out, of, the, two, other, outfielders, the, right, fielder, must, have, the, strongest, arm, because, they, have, the, furthest, possibility, to, throw, the, ball, a, right, fielder, will, throw, the, ball, to, each, base, more, than, the, other, outfielders, will, because, of, their, position, in, respect, to, the, bases, the, center, fielder, s, position, is, in, the, middle, of, the, outfield, directly, behind, second, base, when, looking, at, the, field, from, behind, home, plate, the, center, fielder, is, part, of, a, group, of, two, other, fielders, that, make, up, the, outfield, center, fielders, technically, serve, as, the, captains, of, the, outfield, they, are, and, should, be, the, most, vocal, in, effectively, communicating, with, their, outfielders, since, the, outfielders, are, further, apart, from, each, other, it, can, be, hard, to, hear, each, other, the, center, fielder, covers, the, area, behind, second, base, if, the, ball, is, going, to, be, thrown, in, that, direction, by, covering, this, area, if, the, ball, does, get, past, the, infielder, the, center, fielder, can, prevent, baserunners, from, advancing, to, unwanted, bases, within, the, game, of, softball, the, center, fielder, is, traditionally, the, fastest, of, the, three, outfielders, the, center, fielder, needs, to, be, the, quickest, because, of, the, large, area, of, field, they, must, cover, besides, being, a, quick, player, the, center, fielder, must, have, a, strong, throwing, arm, because, of, the, distance, between, the, player, and, home, plate, the, left, fielder, s, position, is, on, the, left, side, of, the, outfield, behind, the, third, baseman, when, looking, at, the, field, from, behind, home, plate, the, left, fielder, is, part, of, a, group, of, two, other, fielders, that, make, up, the, outfield, generally, outfielders, act, as, a, back, up, to, the, infielders, when, they, make, plays, or, if, the, ball, is, hit, past, the, infield, the, left, fielder, must, field, their, position, but, also, cover, the, area, behind, third, base, if, a, ball, is, thrown, or, hit, in, that, direction, the, left, fielder, covers, this, area, in, the, case, that, the, ball, will, pass, the, infielders, the, left, fielder, can, then, prevent, the, base, runner, from, advancing, to, unwanted, bases, besides, covering, certain, areas, of, the, field, the, left, fielder, must, be, the, smartest, of, the, outfielders, in, the, left, field, position, the, player, has, full, view, of, the, field, the, players, the, baserunners, and, the, batter, the, left, fielder, must, constantly, be, aware, of, the, situation, on, the, field, and, know, what, must, be, done, in, different, circumstances, more, advanced, levels, require, the, left, fielder, to, be, able, to, field, the, ball, during, slap, hit, situations, by, playing, shallow, left, fielders, must, also, play, a, role, in, any, run, down, situation, between, third, base, and, home, plate, or, back, up, any, plays, that, happen, at, third, base, in, case, of, an, overthrow, in, fastpitch, softball, it, is, common, for, teams, to, use, a, designated, player, in, the, lineup, this, player, which, functions, like, the, designated, hitter, in, baseball, hits, in, place, of, one, of, the, position, players, but, does, not, play, defense, unlike, a, designated, hitter, a, designated, player, can, also, become, a, temporary, defensive, substitute, and, the, player, substituted, by, the, designated, player, can, return, to, their, original, position, at, a, later, point, in, the, game, however, the, only, player, that, can, be, substituted, as, an, offensive, replacement, pinch, runner, or, pinch, hitter, is, the, defensive, player, the, designated, player, originally, replaced, known, as, the, flex, at, any, time, the, designated, player, can, be, substituted, back, into, the, lineup, in, the, place, of, the, flex, player, but, once, taken, out, the, designated, player, cannot, take, the, place, of, any, other, player, in, the, lineup, in, some, leagues, and, organizations, four, outfield, players, are, utilized, by, each, team, the, extra, outfielder, is, sometimes, called, the, short, fielder, and, plays, somewhere, behind, second, base, adjusting, position, based, on, the, handedness, or, other, characteristics, of, the, batter, while, the, regular, center, fielder, plays, a, considerably, deeper, position, the, short, fielder, used, as, such, can, take, away, a, batting, strategy, in, softball, which, is, to, hit, soft, liners, over, the, pitcher, however, some, teams, prefer, to, use, the, fourth, outfielder, like, the, others, with, the, center, field, position, being, shared, between, two, players, known, as, the, left, center, fielder, and, the, right, center, fielder, in, this, case, the, four, outfielders, are, spaced, equidistantly, and, play, at, roughly, the, same, depth, in, softball, a, pitch, is, the, act, of, throwing, a, softball, toward, home, plate, to, start, a, play, all, pitches, are, thrown, from, below, the, waist, in, an, underhand, motion, the, phases, of, throwing, include, the, grip, stance, windup, stride, release, and, follow, through, pitchers, throw, a, variety, of, pitches, each, of, which, has, a, slightly, different, velocity, trajectory, movement, hand, position, wrist, position, and, or, arm, angle, these, variations, are, introduced, to, confuse, the, batter, in, various, ways, and, ultimately, aid, the, defensive, team, in, getting, the, batter, or, baserunners, out, to, obtain, variety, and, therefore, enhance, defensive, baseball, strategy, the, pitcher, manipulates, the, grip, on, the, ball, at, the, point, of, release, variations, in, the, grip, cause, the, seams, to, catch, the, air, differently, thereby, changing, the, trajectory, of, the, ball, making, it, harder, for, the, batter, to, hit, the, selection, of, which, pitch, to, use, can, depend, on, a, wide, variety, of, factors, including, the, type, of, hitter, who, is, being, faced, whether, there, are, any, base, runners, how, many, outs, have, been, made, in, the, inning, and, the, current, score, the, responsibility, for, selecting, the, type, of, pitch, is, traditionally, made, by, the, catcher, by, relaying, hand, signals, to, the, pitcher, with, the, fingers, in, more, advanced, play, coaches, may, give, signs, to, batters, and, or, runners, to, initiate, special, plays, in, certain, situations, a, catcher, may, signal, to, a, position, player, that, they, will, be, trying, to, throw, the, runner, out, a, runner, on, base, may, see, the, pitch, sign, given, by, the, catcher, and, hint, it, to, the, batter, using, hand, or, body, motions, the, international, softball, federation, isf, recognizes, three, pitching, styles, the, pitching, distance, can, range, between, 35, feet, for, younger, players, and, 43, feet, for, older, players, collegiate, and, international, level, pitchers, pitch, from, 43, feet, pitches, can, travel, at, speeds, of, more, than, 65, mph, 105, km, h, the, pitching, distance, is, 50, feet, the, pitch, must, be, lofted, in, such, a, way, that, it, falls, onto, the, plate, in, order, for, it, to, be, a, called, strike, the, ball, falls, into, the, strike, zone, instead, of, flying, through, strikeouts, are, rare, in, slow, pitch, pitchers, strategize, to, pitch, the, ball, with, a, high, enough, arc, that, the, batter, cannot, hit, a, line, drive, the, speed, of, the, pitches, ranges, from, 25, to, 35, mph, 40, to, 56, km, h, resulting, in, plenty, of, reaction, time, the, fastball, is, typically, the, first, type, of, pitch, a, player, will, learn, the, changeup, is, the, staple, off, speed, pitch, usually, thrown, to, look, like, a, fastball, but, arriving, much, slower, to, the, plate, its, reduced, speed, coupled, with, its, deceptive, delivery, is, meant, to, confuse, the, batter, s, timing, there, are, a, variety, of, grips, and, techniques, a, pitcher, may, use, to, deliver, a, change, up, such, as, it, is, estimated, that, 14, 62, million, americans, played, at, least, one, game, of, softball, during, the, spring, of, 2015, it, is, played, by, men, and, women, both, recreationally, and, competitively, softball, is, especially, popular, as, a, recreational, activity, for, adults, leagues, for, such, play, are, often, characterized, as, either, fun, leagues, in, which, the, outdoor, exercise, and, player, camaraderie, is, more, important, than, the, final, result, or, serious, leagues, the, distinction, is, not, absolute, and, there, can, be, gradations, within, each, softball, teams, are, often, organized, around, groups, of, employees, who, play, in, the, early, evening, after, work, in, the, summer, in, many, us, cities, adult, softball, teams, are, organized, by, bars, and, clubs, hence, the, popular, term, beer, league, softball, the, teams, can, be, men, s, women, s, or, co, ed, and, skill, levels, can, range, from, novice, to, elite, with, league, composition, reflecting, that, these, leagues, are, typically, either, slow, pitch, or, modified, co, ed, recreational, leagues, where, men, and, women, play, on, the, same, team, generally, have, provisions, to, keep, men, from, dominating, the, game, league, rules, may, stipulate, that, there, must, be, an, equal, number, of, men, and, women, on, the, team, or, that, batting, order, alternate, male, and, female, batters, some, leagues, only, require, three, women, to, play, but, they, must, be, present, on, the, field, at, all, times, others, will, allow, a, game, to, proceed, when, a, team, does, not, have, the, requisite, number, of, women, available, but, charge, the, batting, team, with, an, automatic, out, whenever, the, missing, woman, s, place, in, the, batting, order, comes, up, one, reason, for, the, popularity, of, softball, is, the, ease, of, modification, of, its, rules, thereby, allowing, the, game, to, be, adapted, to, a, variety, of, skill, levels, for, example, in, some, slow, pitch, softball, leagues, a, batter, starts, at, bat, with, a, count, of, one, ball, one, strike, in, some, leagues, the, number, of, home, runs, that, can, be, hit, by, a, team, are, limited, in, other, leagues, stealing, of, bases, is, prohibited, some, groups, allow, for, a, more, defensive, game, by, making, home, plate, a, force, out, for, first, base, this, reduces, scoring, evenly, on, both, sides, and, allows, for, some, margin, of, error, co, ed, leagues, sometimes, adopt, live, play, rules, intended, to, reduce, gender, inequality, under, the, assumption, that, men, will, be, generally, more, powerful, in, most, co, ed, or, mixed, gender, leagues, there, is, something, called, an, encroachment, line, this, requires, the, outfielders, to, stay, behind, a, line, till, the, ball, is, hit, if, an, outfielder, passes, in, front, of, this, line, before, the, female, batter, hits, a, fair, ball, the, batter, will, receive, a, single, base, or, the, result, of, the, play, and, the, base, runners, will, advance, accordingly, the, line, will, be, 180, feet, from, home, plate, one, possible, rule, requires, male, batters, to, switch, hit, some, leagues, even, use, different, balls, for, male, and, female, batters, while, these, modified, rules, are, common, there, are, questions, as, to, their, place, in, modern, adult, sports, some, leagues, require, teams, to, use, limited, flight, softballs, these, softballs, when, hit, will, not, go, as, far, as, regular, softballs, other, leagues, limit, the, number, of, runs, which, can, be, scored, in, an, inning, five, is, a, common, limit, by, allowing, these, and, other, modifications, softball, can, be, enjoyed, by, children, teenagers, and, adults, senior, leagues, with, players, over, the, age, of, 60, are, not, uncommon, an, example, of, a, rule, modification, is, the, offensive, pitcher, or, self, pitch, often, found, in, informal, games, where, the, emphasis, is, on, the, social, rather, than, the, competitive, aspects, of, the, game, the, pitcher, aids, the, batter, by, attempting, to, give, the, easiest, pitch, to, hit, there, are, no, walks, and, a, batter, is, normally, given, a, fixed, number, of, pitches, to, attempt, to, hit, usually, 3, or, 4, the, batter, is, considered, to, strike, out, if, the, batter, fails, to, hit, the, ball, into, fair, territory, after, the, given, number, of, pitches, the, pitcher, does, not, act, as, a, fielder, and, a, rule, is, often, made, that, if, a, batted, ball, touches, the, pitcher, the, batter, is, out, in, some, leagues, the, number, of, pitches, to, walk, or, strikeout, can, be, reduced, for, instance, one, strike, is, an, out, and, two, balls, is, a, walk, this, is, common, in, leagues, where, doubleheaders, are, played, or, in, late, season, leagues, when, reduced, daylight, is, an, issue, it, results, in, shorter, games, as, players, are, more, apt, to, swing, even, at, marginal, pitches, rather, than, risk, striking, out, on, one, pitch, many, leagues, also, include, a, second, first, base, immediately, adjacent, to, the, main, one, this, is, usually, orange, and, the, batter, running, through, first, base, is, supposed, to, run, straight, through, it, this, minimizes, the, chances, of, a, collision, by, the, same, token, some, leagues, have, an, alternate, home, plate, and, rule, that, plays, at, home, are, always, force, plays, in, these, cases, there, is, typically, a, white, line, drawn, approximately, 1, 3, of, the, way, down, the, baseline, that, is, considered, a, point, of, no, return, this, is, designed, to, reduce, the, pickle, which, can, put, a, great, strain, on, the, ankles, and, knees, of, older, baserunners, despite, the, fact, that, it, was, originally, intended, to, be, played, indoors, softball, is, usually, played, outdoors, the, indoor, form, is, sometimes, called, arena, softball, indoor, softball, has, generally, the, same, rules, as, outdoor, softball, only, the, wall, behind, the, batter, is, considered, foul, territory, the, other, walls, are, considered, fair, usually, there, is, a, small, area, on, one, of, the, walls, in, the, outfield, that, results, in, a, home, run, being, awarded, if, the, batted, ball, hits, it, pitching, is, generally, a, little, slower, because, of, the, indoor, turf, or, pitched, through, a, pitching, machine, at, younger, levels, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, batters, a, team, may, have, available, although, only, so, many, can, bat, in, one, inning, some, indoor, facilities, do, not, allow, the, use, of, metal, cleats, on, the, field, which, are, what, players, at, the, age, of, 14, and, up, generally, use, also, some, tournaments, may, require, a, time, limit, for, games, women, s, professional, fastpitch, wpf, is, a, professional, women, s, softball, league, in, the, united, states, and, was,
