and, which, are, said, by, historians, to, have, reflected, the, growing, influence, of, france, rather, than, spain, upon, argentinians, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, the, pouf, style, developed, with, women, creating, volume, in, the, hair, at, the, front, of, the, head, usually, with, a, pad, underneath, to, lift, it, higher, and, ornamented, the, back, with, seashells, pearls,

using, heated, scissor, irons, durable, permanent, waving, became, popular, also, in, this, period, it, was, an, expensive, uncomfortable, and, time, consuming, process, in, which, the, hair, was, put, in, curlers, and, inserted, into, a, steam, or, dry, heat, machine, during, the, 1930s, women, began, to, wear, their, hair, slightly, longer, in, pageboys, bobs, or, waves, and, curls, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, japanese, women, began, wearing, their, hair, in, a, style, called, mimi, kakushi, literally, ear, hiding, in, which, hair, was, pulled, back, to, cover, the, ears, and, tied, into, a, bun, at, the, nape, of, the, neck, waved, or, curled, hair, became, increasingly, popular, for, japanese, women, throughout, this, period, and, permanent, waves, though, controversial, were, extremely, popular, bobbed, hair, also, became, more, popular, for, japanese, women, mainly, among, actresses, and, moga, or, cut, hair, girls, young, japanese, women, who, followed, westernized, fashions, and, lifestyles, in, the, 1920s, during, this, period, western, men, began, to, wear, their, hair, in, ways, popularized, by, movie, stars, such, as, douglas, fairbanks, jr, and, rudolph, valentino, men, wore, their, hair, short, and, either, parted, on, the, side, or, in, the, middle, or, combed, straight, back, and, used, pomade, creams, and, tonics, to, keep, their, hair, in, place,

hair, in, softer, more, natural, styles, in, the, early, 1950s, women, s, hair, was, generally, curled, and, worn, in, a, variety, of, styles, and, lengths, in, the, later, 1950s, high, bouffant, and, beehive, styles, sometimes, nicknamed, b, 52s, for, their, similarity, to, the, bulbous, noses, of, the, b, 52, stratofortress, bomber, became, popular, during, this, period, many, women, washed, and, set, their, hair, only, once, a, week, and, kept, it, in, place, by, wearing, curlers, every, night, and, reteasing, and, respraying, it, every, morning, in, the, 1960s, many, women, began, to, wear, their, hair, in, short, modern, cuts, such, as, the, pixie, cut, while, in, the, 1970s, hair, tended, to, be, longer, and, looser, in, both, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, many, men, and, women, wore, their, hair, very, long, and, straight, long, natural, hair, was, also, worn, due, to, the, emergence, of, counterculture, movements, such, as, the, hippies, who, used, such, styles, to, symbolize, their, opposition, to, the, norm, from, the, 1950s, onward, various, groups, have, pushed, the, norms, for, hairstyles, as, symbols, of, their, unique, ideology, or, identity, the, skinheads, who, opposed, the, hippies, shaved, off, much, of, their, hair, the, punks, of, the, later, 1970s, meanwhile, wanted, to, cause, outrage, styling, their, hair, in, unique, ways, such, as, the, mohawk, and, dyeing, it, in, unnatural, shades, women, straightened, their, hair, through, chemical, straightening, processes, by, ironing, their, hair, at, home, with, a, clothes, iron, or, by, rolling, it, up, with, large, empty, soda, cans, while, wet, since, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, women, have, worn, their, hair, in, a, wide, variety, of, styles, part, of, this, came, from, the, black, is, beautiful, movement, which, promoted, the, natural, beauty, of, the, black, population, as, opposed, to, what, some, considered, a, eurocentric, model, some, critics, argue, that, straightening, or, relaxing, african, hair, is, trying, to, conform, to, a, white, standard, of, beauty, however, there, are, those, that, disagree, with, this, belief, nevertheless, malcolm, x, advised, against, black, people, straightening, their, hair, for, such, reasons, black, hair, then, became, not, only, an, act, of, beauty, but, an, act, of, revolution, the, afro, specifically, was, both, fashionable, and, political, in, the, 1960s, onward, however, the, afro, or, the, natural, as, it, was, first, called, was, not, originally, a, political, choice, but, a, style, favored, by, both, artistic, and, intellectual, black, communities, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, challenges, to, social, norms, for, hair, in, the, 1960s, onward, alongside, the, more, accessible, hair, dyes, allowed, for, a, variation, in, hairstyles, to, emerge, in, the, contemporary, world, women, and, men, can, choose, from, a, broad, range, of, hairstyles, but, they, are, still, expected, to, wear, their, hair, in, ways, that, conform, to, gender, norms, in, much, of, the, world, men, with, long, hair, and, women, whose, hair, does, not, appear, carefully, groomed, may, face, various, forms, of, discrimination, including, harassment, social, shaming, or, workplace, discrimination, this, is, somewhat, less, true, of, african, american, men, who, wear, their, hair, in, a, variety, of, styles, that, overlap, with, those, of, african, american, women, including, box, braids, and, cornrows, fastened, with, rubber, bands, and, dreadlocks, in, the, 1980s, women, pulled, back, their, hair, with, scrunchies, stretchy, ponytail, holders, made, from, cloth, over, fabric, bands, women, also, often, wear, glittery, ornaments, today, as, well, as, claw, style, barrettes, used, to, secure, ponytails, and, other, upswept, or, partially, upswept, hairstyles, the, 1980s, in, america, also, were, a, time, of, noted, turmoil, between, hair, choices, tensions, arose, particularly, between, hair, choices, from, women, of, color, and, the, workplace, as, noted, by, court, cases, such, as, rogers, v, american, airlines, which, upheld, employers, rights, to, ban, certain, hairstyles, in, the, workplace, notably, braided, hairstyles, additional, instances, of, usps, hotel, chains, police, departments, and, another, industries, banning, hairstyles, common, within, the, black, american, community, such, as, braids, colored, hair, and, dreadlocks, from, the, workplace, during, this, period, a, hairstyle, s, aesthetic, considerations, may, be, determined, by, many, factors, such, as, the, subject, s, physical, attributes, and, desired, self, image, and, or, the, stylist, s, artistic, instincts, physical, factors, include, natural, hair, type, and, growth, patterns, face, and, head, shape, from, various, angles, and, overall, body, proportions, medical, considerations, may, also, apply, self, image, may, be, directed, toward, conforming, to, mainstream, values, military, style, crew, cuts, or, current, fad, hairstyles, such, as, the, dido, flip, identifying, with, distinctively, groomed, subgroups, e, g, punk, hair, or, obeying, religious, dictates, e, g, orthodox, jewish, have, payot, rastafari, have, dreadlocks, north, india, jatas, or, the, sikh, practice, of, kesh, though, this, is, highly, contextual, such, that, mainstream, look, in, one, setting, may, be, limited, to, a, subgroup, in, another, a, hairstyle, is, achieved, by, arranging, hair, in, a, certain, way, occasionally, using, combs, a, blow, dryer, gel, or, other, products, the, practice, of, styling, hair, is, often, called, hairdressing, especially, when, done, as, an, occupation, hairstyling, may, also, include, adding, accessories, such, as, headbands, or, barrettes, to, the, hair, to, hold, it, in, place, enhance, its, ornamental, appearance, or, partially, or, fully, conceal, it, with, coverings, such, as, a, kippah, hijab, tam, or, turban, hair, dressing, may, include, cuts, weaves, coloring, extensions, perms, permanent, relaxers, curling, and, any, other, form, of, styling, or, texturing, stylists, often, wash, a, subject, s, hair, first, so, that, the, hair, is, cut, while, still, slightly, damp, compared, to, dry, hair, wet, hair, can, be, easier, to, manage, in, a, cut, style, situation, because, the, added, weight, and, surface, tension, of, the, water, cause, the, strands, to, stretch, downward, and, cling, together, along, the, hair, s, length, holding, a, line, and, making, it, easier, for, the, stylist, to, create, a, form, it, is, important, to, note, that, this, method, of, cutting, hair, while, wet, may, be, most, suitable, or, common, for, straight, hair, types, curly, kinky, and, other, types, of, hair, textures, with, considerable, volume, may, benefit, from, cutting, while, dry, as, the, hair, is, in, a, more, natural, state, and, the, hair, can, be, cut, evenly, hair, cutting, or, hair, trimming, is, intended, to, create, or, maintain, a, specific, shape, and, form, there, are, ways, to, trim, one, s, own, hair, but, usually, another, person, is, enlisted, to, perform, the, process, as, it, is, difficult, to, maintain, symmetry, while, cutting, hair, at, the, back, of, one, s, head, cutting, hair, is, often, done, with, hair, clipper, scissors, and, razors, combs, and, hair, grips, are, often, employed, to, isolate, a, section, of, hair, which, is, then, trimmed, brushes, and, combs, are, used, to, organize, and, untangle, the, hair, encouraging, all, of, the, strands, to, lie, in, the, same, direction, and, removing, debris, such, as, lint, dandruff, or, hairs, that, have, already, shed, from, their, follicles, but, continue, to, cling, to, the, other, hairs, there, are, all, manner, of, detangling, tools, available, in, a, wide, variety, of, price, ranges, combs, come, in, all, shapes, and, sizes, and, all, manner, of, materials, including, plastics, wood, and, horn, similarly, brushes, also, come, in, all, sizes, and,

like, combs, and, clips, to, prevent, spreading, hair, conditions, like, dandruff, and, head, lice, the, historical, dictum, to, brush, hair, with, one, hundred, strokes, every, day, is, somewhat, archaic, dating, from, a, time, when, hair, was, washed, less, frequently, the, brushstrokes, would, spread, the, scalp, s, natural, oils, down, through, the, hair, creating, a, protective, effect, now, however, this, does, not, apply, when, the, natural, oils, have, been, washed, off, by, frequent, shampoos, also, hairbrushes, are, now, usually, made, with, rigid, plastic, bristles, instead, of, the, natural, boar, s, bristles, that, were, once, standard, the, plastic, bristles, increase, the, likelihood, of, actually, injuring, the, scalp, and, hair, with, excessively, vigorous, brushing, however, traditional, brushes, with, boar, s, bristles, are, still, commonly, used, among, african, americans, and, those, with, coarse, or, kinky, textures, to, soften, and, lay, down,
