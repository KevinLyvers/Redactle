predecessors, had, required, their, labor, producing, household, goods, in, the, medieval, era, business, owners, exploitation, and, abuse, of, child, laborers, during, this, period, differed, from, how, children, had, been, treated, as, workers, within, a, family, unit, though, thanks, to, advocacy, including, photographic, documentation, of, children, s, exploitation, and, abuse, by, business, owners, western, nations, enacted, a, series, of, child, labor, laws, putting, an, end, to, child, labor, in, nations, such, as, the, u, s, 1949, this, fully, entrenched, through, law, the, western, idea, that, childhood, is, a, time, for, leisure, not, work, and, with, leisure, time, comes, more, space, for, consumer, goods, such, as, toys, during, the, second, world, war, some, new, types, of, toys, were, created, through, accidental, innovation, after, trying, to, create, a, replacement, for, synthetic, rubber, the, american, earl, l, warrick, inadvertently, invented, nutty, putty, during, world, war, ii, later, peter, hodgson, recognized, the, potential, as, a, childhood, plaything, and, packaged, it, as, silly, putty, similarly, play, doh, was, originally, created, as, a, wallpaper, cleaner, in, 1943, richard, james, was, experimenting, with, springs, as, part, of, his, military, research, when, he, saw, one, come, loose, and, fall, to, the, floor, he, was, intrigued, by, the, way, it, flopped, around, on, the, floor, he, spent, two, years, fine, tuning, the, design, to, find, the, best, gauge, of, steel, and, coil, the, result, was, the, slinky, which, went, on, to, sell, in, stores, throughout, the, united, states, after, the, second, world, war, as, society, became, ever, more, affluent, and, new, technology, and, materials, plastics, for, toy, manufacture, became, available, toys, became, cheap, and, ubiquitous, in, households, across, the, western, world, at, this, point, name, brand, toys, became, widespread, in, the, u, s, a, new, phenomenon, that, helped, market, mass, produce, toys, to, audiences, of, children, growing, up, with, ample, leisure, time, and, during, a, period, of, relative, prosperity, among, the, more, well, known, products, of, the, 1950s, there, was, the, danish, company, lego, s, line, of, colourful, interlocking, plastic, brick, construction, sets, based, on, hilary, page, s, kiddicraft, self, locking, bricks, described, by, london, s, v, a, museum, of, childhood, as, among, the, must, have, toys, of, the, 1940s, mr, potato, head, the, barbie, doll, inspired, by, the, bild, lilli, doll, from, germany, and, action, man, the, rubik, s, cube, became, an, enormous, seller, in, the, 1980s, in, modern, times, there, are, computerized, dolls, that, can, recognize, and, identify, objects, the, voice, of, their, owner, and, choose, among, hundreds, of, pre, programmed, phrases, with, which, to, respond, the, act, of, children, s, play, with, toys, embodies, the, values, set, forth, by, the, adults, of, their, specific, community, but, through, the, lens, of, the, child, s, perspective, within, cultural, societies, toys, are, a, medium, to, enhance, a, child, s, cognitive, social, and, linguistic, learning, in, some, cultures, toys, are, used, as, a, way, to, enhance, a, child, s, skillset, within, the, traditional, boundaries, of, their, future, roles, in, the, community, in, saharan, and, north, african, cultures, play, is, facilitated, by, children, through, the, use, of, toys, to, enact, scenes, recognizable, in, their, community, such, as, hunting, and, herding, the, value, is, placed, in, a, realistic, version, of, development, in, preparing, a, child, for, the, future, they, are, likely, to, grow, up, into, this, allows, the, child, to, imagine, and, create, a, personal, interpretation, of, how, they, view, the, adult, world, however, in, other, cultures, toys, are, used, to, expand, the, development, of, a, child, s, cognition, in, an, idealistic, fashion, in, these, communities, adults, place, the, value, of, play, with, toys, to, be, on, the, aspirations, they, set, forth, for, their, child, in, the, western, culture, the, barbie, and, action, man, represent, lifelike, figures, but, in, an, imaginative, state, out, of, reach, from, the, society, of, these, children, and, adults, these, toys, give, way, to, a, unique, world, in, which, children, s, play, is, isolated, and, independent, of, the, social, constraints, placed, on, society, leaving, the, children, free, to, delve, into, the, imaginary, and, idealized, version, of, what, their, development, in, life, could, be, in, addition, children, from, differing, communities, may, treat, their, toys, in, different, ways, based, on, their, cultural, practices, children, in, more, affluent, communities, may, tend, to, be, possessive, of, their, toys, while, children, from, poorer, communities, may, be, more, willing, to, share, and, interact, more, with, other, children, the, importance, the, child, places, on, possession, is, dictated, by, the, values, in, place, within, the, community, that, the, children, observe, on, a, daily, basis, toys, like, play, itself, serve, multiple, purposes, in, both, humans, and, animals, they, provide, entertainment, while, fulfilling, an, educational, role, toys, enhance, cognitive, behavior, and, stimulate, creativity, they, aid, in, the, development, of, physical, and, mental, skills, which, are, necessary, in, later, life, wooden, blocks, though, simple, are, regarded, by, early, childhood, education, experts, such, as, sally, cartwright, 1974, as, an, excellent, toy, for, young, children, she, praised, the, fact, that, they, are, relatively, easy, to, engage, with, can, be, used, in, repeatable, and, predictable, ways, and, are, versatile, and, open, ended, allowing, for, a, wide, variety, of, developmentally, appropriate, play, andrew, witkin, director, of, marketing, for, mega, brands, told, investor, s, business, daily, that, they, help, develop, hand, eye, coordination, math, and, science, skills, and, also, let, kids, be, creative, other, toys, like, marbles, jackstones, and, balls, serve, similar, functions, in, child, development, allowing, children, to, use, their, minds, and, bodies, to, learn, about, spatial, relationships, cause, and, effect, and, a, wide, range, of, other, skills, one, example, of, the, dramatic, ways, that, toys, can, influence, child, development, involves, clay, sculpting, toys, such, as, play, doh, and, silly, putty, and, their, home, made, counterparts, mary, ucci, educational, director, of, the, child, study, center, of, wellesley, college, has, demonstrated, how, such, toys, positively, impact, the, physical, development, cognitive, development, emotional, development, and, social, development, of, children, toys, for, infants, often, make, use, of, distinctive, sounds, bright, colors, and, unique, textures, through, repetition, of, play, with, toys, infants, begin, to, recognize, shapes, and, colors, play, doh, silly, putty, and, other, hands, on, materials, allow, the, child, to, make, toys, of, their, own, educational, toys, for, school, age, children, of, often, contain, a, puzzle, problem, solving, technique, or, mathematical, proposition, often, toys, designed, for, older, audiences, such, as, teenagers, or, adults, demonstrate, advanced, concepts, newton, s, cradle, a, desk, toy, designed, by, simon, prebble, demonstrates, the, conservation, of, momentum, and, energy, not, all, toys, are, appropriate, for, all, ages, of, children, even, some, toys, which, are, marketed, for, a, specific, age, range, can, even, harm, the, development, of, children, in, that, range, such, as, when, for, example, toys, meant, for, young, girls, contribute, to, the, ongoing, problem, of, girls, sexualization, in, western, culture, a, study, suggested, that, supplying, fewer, toys, in, the, environment, allows, toddlers, to, better, focus, to, explore, and, play, more, creatively, the, provision, of, four, rather, than, sixteen, toys, is, thus, suggested, to, promote, children, s, development, and, healthy, play, age, compression, is, the, modern, trend, of, children, moving, through, play, stages, faster, than, was, the, case, in, the, past, children, have, a, desire, to, progress, to, more, complex, toys, at, a, faster, pace, girls, in, particular, barbie, dolls, for, example, were, once, marketed, to, girls, around, 8, years, old, but, have, been, found, to, be, more, popular, in, recent, years, with, girls, around, 3, years, old, with, most, girls, outgrowing, the, brand, by, about, age, 7, the, packaging, for, the, dolls, labels, them, appropriate, for, ages, 3, and, up, boys, in, contrast, apparently, enjoy, toys, and, games, over, a, longer, timespan, gravitating, towards, toys, that, meet, their, interest, in, assembling, and, disassembling, mechanical, toys, and, toys, that, move, fast, and, things, that, fight, an, industry, executive, points, out, that, girls, have, entered, the, tween, phase, by, the, time, they, are, 8, years, old, and, want, non, traditional, toys, whereas, boys, have, been, maintaining, an, interest, in, traditional, toys, until, they, are, 12, years, old, meaning, the, traditional, toy, industry, holds, onto, their, boy, customers, for, 50, longer, than, their, girl, customers, girls, gravitate, towards, music, clothes, make, up, television, talent, shows, and, celebrities, as, young, children, are, more, exposed, to, and, drawn, to, music, intended, for, older, children, and, teens, companies, are, having, to, rethink, how, they, develop, and, market, their, products, girls, also, demonstrate, a, longer, loyalty, to, characters, in, toys, and, games, marketed, towards, them, a, variety, of, global, toy, companies, have, marketed, themselves, to, this, aspect, of, girls, development, for, example, the, hello, kitty, brand, and, the, disney, princess, franchise, boys, have, shown, an, interest, in, computer, games, at, an, ever, younger, age, in, recent, years, certain, toys, such, as, barbie, dolls, and, toy, soldiers, are, often, perceived, as, being, more, acceptable, for, one, gender, than, the, other, the, turning, point, for, the, addition, of, gender, to, toys, came, about, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, before, 1975, only, about, two, percent, of, toys, were, labeled, by, gender, whereas, today, on, the, disney, store, s, website, considered, a, dominating, global, force, for, toys, by, researcher, claire, miller, all, toys, are, labeled, by, gender, the, journal, sex, roles, began, publishing, research, on, this, topic, in, 1975, focusing, on, the, effects, of, gender, in, youth, too, many, psychological, textbooks, began, to, address, this, new, issue, along, with, these, publications, researchers, also, started, to, challenge, the, ideas, of, male, and, female, as, being, opposites, even, going, as, far, as, to, claim, toys, which, have, characteristics, of, both, genders, are, preferable, a, milestone, for, research, on, gender, is, the, use, of, meta, analysis, which, provides, a, way, to, assess, patterns, in, a, systematic, way, especially, relevant, for, a, topic, such, as, gender, which, can, be, difficult, to, quantify, nature, and, nurture, have, historically, been, analyzed, when, looking, at, gender, in, play, as, well, as, reinforcement, by, peers, and, parents, of, typical, gender, roles, and, consequently, gender, play, toy, companies, have, often, promoted, the, segregation, by, gender, in, toys, because, it, enables, them, to, customize, the, same, toy, for, each, gender, which, ultimately, doubles, their, revenue, for, example, legos, added, more, colors, to, certain, sets, of, toys, in, the, 1990s, including, colors, commonly, attributed, to, girls, such, as, lavender, it, has, been, noted, by, researchers, that, children, as, young, as, 18, months, display, sex, stereotyped, toy, choices, when, eye, movement, is, tracked, in, young, infants, infant, girls, show, a, visual, preference, for, a, doll, over, a, toy, truck, d, 1, 0, boys, showed, no, preference, for, the, truck, over, the, doll, however, they, did, fixate, on, the, truck, more, than, the, girls, d, 78, this, small, study, suggests, that, even, before, any, self, awareness, of, gender, identity, has, emerged, children, already, prefer, sex, typical, toys, these, differences, in, toy, choice, are, well, established, within, the, child, by, the, age, of, three, another, study, done, by, jeffrey, trawick, smith, took, 60, different, children, ages, three, to, four, and, observed, them, playing, with, nine, different, toys, deemed, best, for, development, they, were, allowed, to, play, with, the, toys, in, a, typical, environment, a, preschool, classroom, which, allowed, for, the, results, to, be, more, authentic, compared, to, research, done, in, a, lab, the, researchers, then, quantified, play, quality, of, the, children, with, each, toy, based, on, factors, such, as, learning, problem, solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and, peer, interaction, the, results, revealed, that, boys, generally, received, higher, scores, for, overall, play, quality, than, girls, and, the, toys, with, the, best, play, quality, were, those, identified, as, the, most, gender, neutral, such, as, building, blocks, and, bricks, along, with, pieces, modeling, people, trawick, smith, then, concluded, that, the, study, encourages, a, focus, on, toys, which, are, beneficial, to, both, genders, in, order, to, create, a, better, balance, while, some, parents, promote, gender, neutral, play, many, parents, encourage, their, children, to, participate, in, sex, typed, activities, including, doll, playing, and, engaging, in, housekeeping, activities, for, girls, and, playing, with, trucks, and, engaging, in, sports, activities, for, boys, researcher, susan, witt, said, that, parents, are, the, primary, influencer, on, the, gender, roles, of, their, children, parents, siblings, peers, and, even, teachers, have, been, shown, to, react, more, positively, to, children, engaging, in, sex, typical, behavior, and, playing, with, sex, typical, toys, this, is, often, done, through, encouragement, or, discouragement, as, well, as, suggestions, and, imitation, additionally, sons, are, more, likely, to, be, reinforced, for, sex, typical, play, and, discouraged, from, atypical, play, however, it, is, generally, not, as, looked, down, upon, for, girls, to, play, with, toys, designed, for, boys, an, activity, which, has, also, become, more, common, in, recent, years, fathers, are, also, more, likely, to, reinforce, typical, play, and, discourage, atypical, play, than, mothers, are, a, study, done, by, researcher, susan, witt, suggests, that, stereotypes, are, oftentimes, only, strengthened, by, the, environment, which, perpetuates, them, to, linger, in, older, life, this, stereotypical, attribution, of, sex, typical, toys, for, girls, and, boys, is, gradually, changing, with, toys, companies, creating, more, gender, neutral, toys, as, the, benefits, associated, with, allowing, children, to, play, with, toys, that, appeal, to, them, far, outweighs, controlling, their, individual, preferences, for, example, many, stores, are, beginning, to, change, their, gender, labels, on, children, s, play, items, target, removed, all, identification, related, to, gender, from, their, toy, aisles, and, disney, did, the, same, for, their, costumes, the, disney, store, is, an, especially, prevalent, example, of, gender, in, play, because, they, are, a, global, identity, in, the, toy, world, a, study, done, regarding, their, website, found, that, though, they, have, removed, gender, labels, from, their, costumes, the, toys, online, reflect, more, stereotypical, gender, identities, for, example, toys, depicting, males, were, associated, with, physicality, and, females,
