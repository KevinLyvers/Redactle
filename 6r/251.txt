was, clearly, intended, as, pornography, however, neither, the, english, nor, the, united, states, act, defined, what, constituted, obscene, leaving, this, for, the, courts, to, determine, for,

prostitutes, in, africa, said, there, s, no, doubt, about, the, efficiency, of, the, testing, method, but, he, felt, a, little, uncomfortable, because, it, s, giving, the, wrong, message, that, you, can, have, multiple, sex, partners, without, condoms, but, i, can, t, say, it, doesn, t, work, relatedly, it, has, been, found, that, individuals, who, received, little, sex, education, and, or,

because, they, have, no, idea, what, their, status, is, i, don, t, hook, up, with, people, outside, of, the, porn, industry, because, i, m, terrified, and, i, m, not, the, only, one, there, s, many,

necessary, precautions, like, prep, and, are, at, lower, risk, to, contract, hiv, than, most, sexually, active, persons, outside, the, industry, many, prominent, female, performers, have, vehemently, opposed, regulatory, measures, like, measure, b, that, sought, to, make, the, use, of, condoms, mandatory, in, pornographic, films, professional, female, performers, have, called, the, use, of, condoms, on, a, daily, basis, at, work, an, occupational, hazard, as, they, cause, micro, tears, friction, burn, swelling, and, yeast, infections, which, altogether, they, say, makes, them, more,

pornography, believing, it, to, be, harmful, other, feminist, groups, oppose, censorship, efforts, insisting, it, is, benign, a, large, scale, study, of, data, from, the, general, social, survey,

of, pornography, were, found, more, egalitarian, than, nonusers, they, are, more, likely, to, hold, favorable, attitudes, towards, women, in, positions, of, power, and, in, workplaces, outside, home,

pornographic, representations, particularly, in, the, interracial, genres, as, pornography, becomes, a, kind, of, manual, on, how, bodies, in, pleasure, can, look, and, is, one, of, the, few, places, where, we, see, our, bodies, and, other, people, s, bodies, it, becomes, imperative, on, pornography, to, represent, variety, of, forms, stated, the, feminist, scholars, a, 2019, study, of, pornhub, videos, uploaded, between, 2000, and, 2016, noted, that, 55, of, male, performers, were, white, while, the, rest, were, non, white, among, the, female, performers, approximately, 37, were, white, 28, black, 17, asian, 16, latina, and, the, rest, 2, others, when, the, data, was, collated, with, us, demographics, of, 2018, white, women, were, found, significantly, under, represented, as, performers,

studies, scholars, mireille, miller, young, and, jennifer, christine, nash, in, their, writings, on, the, intersectionality, of, race, and, pornography, noted, that, black, people, have, been, depicted, as, being, hypersexual, and, black, women, more, objectified, the, scholars, also, noted, major, discrepancies, in, pay, rates, white, women, have, historically, made, 75, percent, more,

violence, and, aggression, and, that, pornography, objectifies, women, multiple, analyses, of, pornographic, videos, found, that, women, have, been, overwhelmingly, at, the, receiving, end, of, aggression, from, male, performers, with, the, reaction, of, women, being, either, positive, or, neutral, towards, aggression, which, is, at, odds, considering, a, report, that, found, only, 14, 2, of, us, adult, women, find, pain, during, sex, as, appealing, black, women, have, been, the, targets, of, aggression, and, faced, more, violence, from, both, black, and, white, men, than, did, white, women, while, black, men, engaged, in, fewer, intimate, behaviors, than, white, men, white, women, were, found, more, likely, to, experience, violence, during, sexual, activity, with, white, men, than, with, black, men, asian, women, appeared, less, objectified, and, treated, with, less, aggression, than, white, or, black, women, but, also, they, had, less, agency, in, sexual, activities, a, 2018, study, of, popular, videos, on, pornhub, found, that, segments, of, aggression, towards, females, are, fewer, now, and, they, have, reduced, gradually, over, the, past, decade, with, viewers, preferring, content, where, the, women, genuinely, enjoy, themselves, prominent, anti, pornography, feminists, such, as, andrea, dworkin, and, catharine, mackinnon, argue, that, all, pornography, is, demeaning, to, women, or, that, it, contributes, to, violence, against, women, both, in, its, production, and, in, its, consumption, the, production, of, pornography, they, argue, entails, the, physical, psychological, or, economic, coercion, of, the, women, who, perform, in, it, they, charged, that, pornography, eroticizes, the, domination, humiliation, and, coercion, of, women, while, reinforcing, sexual, and, cultural, attitudes, that, are, complicit, in, rape, and, sexual, harassment, other, sex, work, exclusionary, feminists, have, insisted, that, pornography, presents, a, severely, distorted, image, of, sexual, consent, and, it, reinforces, sexual, myths, like, women, are, readily, available, and, desire, to, engage, in, sex, at, any, time, with, any, man, on, men, s, terms, and, always, respond, positively, to, men, s, advances, in, contrast, to, the, objections, other, feminist, scholars, ranging, from, betty, friedan, and, kate, millett, to, karen, decrow, wendy, kaminer, and, jamaica, kincaid, have, supported, the, right, to, consume, pornography, the, anti, porn, feminist, stranglehold, began, to, loose, when, sex, positive, feminists, like, susie, bright, performers, nina, hartley, and, candida, royalle, affirmed, the, rights, of, women, to, consume, and, produce, porn, the, works, of, camille, paglia, established, that, westerners, have, been, pagan, celebrants, for, long, and, pornography, has, been, an, inseparable, part, of, western, culture, wendy, mcelroy, has, noted, that, both, feminism, and, pornography, are, mutually, related, with, both, thriving, in, environments, of, tolerance, and, both, repressed, anytime, regulations, are, placed, on, sexual, expression, societies, where, pornography, and, sexual, expression, is, prohibited, are, more, likely, to, be, the, places, where, women, are, often, subjected, to, violence, and, sexual, abuse, women, s, rights, are, far, stronger, in, societies, with, liberal, attitudes, to, sex, think, of, conservative, countries, such, as, afghanistan, yemen, or, china, and, the, place, of, women, there, and, yet, anti, porn, campaigners, neglect, such, issues, entirely, a, recent, study, by, the, us, department, of, justice, compared, the, four, states, that, had, highest, broadband, access, and, found, there, was, a, 27, per, cent, decrease, in, rape, and, attempted, rape, and, the, four, with, the, lowest, had, a, 53, per, cent, increase, over, the, same, period, anna, span, the, lesbian, feminist, movement, of, the, 1980s, is, considered, a, seminal, moment, for, the, women, in, the, porn, industry, as, more, women, entered, into, the, developmental, side, this, allowed, women, to, gear, porn, more, towards, women, as, they, knew, what, women, wanted, both, from, the, perspective, of, actresses, as, well, as, the, female, audience, the, movement, also, sparked, the, arrival, of, making, lesbian, porn, for, lesbians, instead, of, men, this, change, has, been, considered, good, as, for, a, long, time, the, porn, industry, had, been, directed, by, men, for, men, furthermore, the, advent, of, the, vcr, home, video, and, affordable, video, cameras, allowed, for, the, possibility, of, feminist, pornography, feminist, porn, directors, are, interested, in, challenging, representations, of, men, and, women, as, well, as, in, providing,

over, the, content, from, her, partners, to, the, location, costumes, and, the, vibe, of, the, video, i, am, a, feminist, so, what, i, create, is, feminist, and, i, produce, ethical, porn, which, is, when, everything, is, consensual, she, said, women, are, more, likely, to, consume, porn, that, is, female, centered, and, feature, acts, such, as, cunnilingus, a, study, of, pornographic, videos, found, that, when, men, spend, more, time, performing, cunnilingus, they, have, higher, volumes, of, ejaculate, an, increase, in, sexual, arousal, resulting, from, exposure, to, the, vaginal, secretion, copulins, during, cunnilingus, is, reasoned, to, be, the, cause, female, centric, porn, is, mostly, made, by, women, in, these, works, the, initiation, of, sexual, activity, is, done, by, the, female, porn, for, women, is, identified, by, factors, like, greater, attention, to, sensual, surroundings, and, soft, focus, camerawork, rather, than, on, explicit, depiction, of, sexual, activity, making, the, productions, more, warm, and, humane, compared, to, the, traditional, porn, made, for, hetrosexual, men, if, feminists, define, pornography, per, se, as, the, enemy, the, result, will, be, to, make, a, lot, of, women, ashamed, of, their, sexual, feelings, and, afraid, to, be, honest, about, them, and, the, last, thing, women, need, is, more, sexual, shame, guilt, and, hypocrisy, this, time, served, up, by, feminism, ellen, willis, porn, industry, has, been, noted, for, being, one, of, the, few, industries, where, women, enjoy, a, power, advantage, in, the,

performers, can, often, dictate, which, male, actors, they, will, and, will, not, work, with, porn, at, least, porn, produced, for, a, heterosexual, audience, is, one, of, the, few, contemporary, occupations, where, the, pay, gap, operates, in, the, favor, of, women, the, average, actress, makes, fifty, to, a, hundred, per, cent, more, money, than, her, male, counterpart, psychologists,

177, porn, actresses, with, regular, women, of, similar, age, ethnicity, and, marital, status, and, found, that, the, porn, actresses, had, higher, levels, of, self, esteem, positive, feelings, social, support, sexual, satisfaction, and, spirituality, compared, to, the, regular, women, in, analytical, psychology, human, sexual, instincts, and, religious, spiritual, instincts, are, considered, tightly, associated, with, each, other, with, both, sharing, a, common, instinctual, objective, which, as, carl, jung, acknowledged, is, the, striving, of, the, psyche, for, wholeness, the, psyche, of, a, person, is, understood, to, be, differentiated, as, being, made, up, of, psychological, traits, that, are, feminine, and, masculine, in, nature, according, to, jung, this, differentiation, allowed, the, formation, of, opposite, polarities, which, made, consciousness, possible, according, to, psychologist, and, author, giorgio, tricarico, as, an, individual, moves, through, various, life, experiences, their, psyche, approaches, wholeness, or, the, state, of, non, differentiated, a, realm, of, unified, impersonal, consciousness, considered, belonging, to, the, sacred, or, divine, in, hindu, cosmological, view, the, universe, is, weaved, from, the, two, coexisting, generative, principles, feminine, and, masculine, the, goddess, or, shakti, spirit, feminine, principle, is, the, pure, consciousness, underlying, all, existence, shakti, embraced, by, shiva, matter, masculine, principle, both, together, in, perpetual, union, form, the, nondualistic, absolute, shiva, and, shakti, in, a, state, of, copulation, represent, the, flow, of, erotic, energy, in, an, individual, sigmund, freud, called, the, feminine, shakti, libido, that, cannot, be, simply, repressed, self, realization, or, becoming, aware, of, the, deep, femininity, entails, dealing, with, the, powerful, sexual, energy, schools, of, religious, thought, such, as, the, kundalini, yoga, and, tantra, which, involve, using, sexual, energy, for, the, purpose, of, self, realization, had, been, developed, in, india, the, concept, of, gender, had, been, studied, in, hinduism, for, long, where, the, conclusion, was, arrived, that, the, human, self, tman, an, emanation, from, the, nondual, absolute, is, androgynous, and, is, encased, in, human, bodies, which, themselves, are, androgyne, in, the, sense, that, every, body, is, a, compound, of, both, the, feminine, and, the, masculine, principles, sexuality, is, considered, a, creative, function, of, nature, to, reunite, the, two, principles, with, the, nondual, absolute, the, masculine, and, the, feminine, principles, of, the, self, have, been, identified, to, the, deities, shiva, and, shakti, who, make, up, the, two, sexual, polarities, by, establishing, a, connection, between, the, two, for, the, flow, of, erotic, energy, as, in, the, case, of, an, electric, circuit, between, the, two, electric, polarities, for, the, flow, of, electric, current, in, one, s, own, being, by, the, means, of, sexual, stimulation, through, erotic, visualization, or, ritual, copulation, the, self, would, divest, from, its, material, identity, and, realign, into, the, bipolar, being, which, now, represents, a, unit, microcosm, mirroring, the, nondual, macrocosm, thus, an, individual, attains, bliss, in, being, one, with, the, absolute, the, hindu, tantric, idea, of, the, feminine, and, the, masculine, arriving, at, unity, in, the, divine, feminine, or, the, unified, divine, consciousness, is, analogous, to, the, analytical, psychology, idea, of, coincidentia, oppositorum, where, the, anima, animus, of, an, individual, unite, with, the, spirit, to, become, one, or, whole, in, the, hindu, tantric, view, the, women, who, participate, in, union, rituals, thereby, enabling, men, to, attain, self, realization, are, regarded, as, shakti, or, the, goddess, as, they, are, believed, to, embody, her, recognition, of, the, deity, in, an, objective, woman, is, centered, upon, a, man, s, acceptance, of, the, subjective, feminine, and, the, primacy, of, her, desires, tricarico, professed, that, modern, day, pornography, in, its, essence, is, a, desacralised, technological, and, consumerist, equivalent, of, the, ancient, sacred, prostitution, a, custom, that, involved, honoring, of, the, sacred, feminine, and, the, worship, of, prostitutes, as, the, goddess, the, feminine, is, believed, to, embody, particular, qualities, of, the, sacred, or, divine, more, broadly, and, deeply, than, the, masculine, consequently, in, women, the, ability, to, incorporate, nondualistic, awareness, is, assumed, to, be, higher, tricarico, argued, that, women, in, porn, through, their, performances, of, many, sexual, acts, would, inadvertently, approach, the, non, differentiated, state, an, effect, which, he, called, the, intimation, of, hierophany, porn, actresses, may, embody, the, medium, to, enter, what, used, to, be, the, realm, of, the, sacred, he, said, they, have, been, likened, to, the, descendants, of, the, lost, goddesses, who, are, now, offering, the, gift, of, the, numinous, to, all, through, their, performances, but, are, unacknowledged, or, devalued, for, their, contributions, the, use, of, epithets, like, bitch, whore, slut, for, sexually, active, women, has, been, attributed, to, the, denial, of, the, subjective, feminine, by, men, the, subdued, acceptance, of, female, sexuality, as, a, value, in, its, own, right, is, manifested, when, a, man, s, admiration, for, the, bitch, gets, subtended, if, she, happens, to, be, his, wife, or, girlfriend, along, with, showing, admiration, lust, gratitude, and, desire, men, show, brazen, hate, and, disgust, towards, women, this, behavioral, dichotomy, had, been, ascribed, to, the, patriarchal, hypocrisy, embedded, in, men, the, unconscious, perception, by, men, of, the, greater, ability, in, women, to, reach, the, undifferentiated, state, of, psyche, is, reasoned, to, be, a, cause, for, their, intentional, humiliation, wilful, devaluation, and, deliberate, belittlement, of, women, according, to, julia, kristeva, a, psychoanalyst, scholar, the, psychological, rejection, and, fear, of, the, mother, figure, in, males, is, the, root, cause, for, their, behaviors, that, seek, to, subjugate, women, men, in, their, infancy, live, in, a, state, of, undifferentiated, physical, and, psychic, fusion, with, the, mother, experiencing, emotional, exhilaration, and, jouissance, however, as, they, mature, sensing, their, separateness, from, the, mother, they, seek, to, become, independent, subjects, and, take, recourse, to, paternal, images, and, patriarchal, behaviors, with, the, hope, of, eliminating, any, possible, further, undifferentiated, psychotic, fusion, with, the, mother, as, they, feel, threatened, by, it, according, to, psychoanalyst, melanie, klein, the, rejection, and, fear, of, the, maternal, image, in, females, leads, them, to, reject, their, own, femininity, tricarico, hoped, that, porn, becomes, a, place, where, men, discard, patriarchal, antics, women, embrace, the, sacred, aspects, and, audience, incorporate, porn, as, a, joyful, experience, for, the, body, a, genuine, form, of, play, that, helps, them, approach, the, non, differentiated, state, in, being, with, other, we, differentiate, ourselves, and, experience, jouissance, whilst, becoming, a, unit, being, as, most, religions, have, long, and, vehemently, opposed, sexual, natured, things, in, general, religious, people, are, found, highly, susceptible, to, experience, great, distress, in, their, use, of, pornography, religious, people, who, use, pornography, tend, to, feel, sexually, ashamed, sexual, shame, which, arises, from, a, person, s, perception, of, their, self, in, other, peoples, mind, and, a, negative, assessment, of, their, own, sexuality, is, considered, a, powerful, factor, that, over, time, governs, individual, behavior, as, sexuality, is, interwoven, into, one, s, personal, identity, sexual, shame, or, sexual, embarrassment, are, found, to, attack, a, person, s, very, sense, of, self, when, a, sexual, shaming, event, occurs, the, person, attributes, causation, to, oneself, resulting, in, self, condemnation, and, experience, feelings, of, sadness, loneliness, anger, unworthiness, and, rejection, along, with, a, perceived, judgment, of, their, self, by, others, in, this, mental, landscape, a, fear, arises, that, ones, sexual, self, needs, to, be, hiden, this, psychological, process, initiates, and, fuels, further, shame, and, lowers, one, s, self, esteem, sexual, shame, constricts, the, psychic, space, for, free, play, with, one, s, sexuality, sexual, shame, in, people, begets, more, shame, and, leads, to, a, cycle, of, powerlessness, culminating, in, deepening, negative, emotions, those, who, tend, to, feel, shame, easily, are, found, to, be, at, greater, risk, for, depression, and, anxiety, disorders, according, to, clinical, psychologist, gershen, kaufman, all, sexual, disorders, are, majorly, disorders, of, shame, the, cause, of, attributing, shame, to, sexuality, is, traced, back, to, the, biblical, interpretation, of, nakedness, being, shameful, much, of, the, christian, mythology, presented, sexuality, as, an, obstacle, to, be, surmounted, in, the, way, of, salvation, the, major, abrahamic, religions, condemn, and, consider, all, forms, of, nonmarital, and, nonreproductive, sexual, pleasure, as, unacceptable, in, hinduism, bhoga, sexual, pleasure, is, celebrated, as, a, value, in, itself, and, is, considered, one, of, the, two, ways, to, nirvana, the, other, being, the, more, demanding, yoga, a, central,

kama, was, elaborated, by, the, sage, vatsyayana, in, his, treatise, kama, sutra, which, states, that, sexual, pleasure, and, food, are, essential, for, the, well, being, of, the, body, and, that, on, both, of, them, are, founded, virtue, and, prosperity, food, despite, causing, indigestion, sometimes, would, still, be, consumed, regularly, and, so, it, must, be, with, pleasure, which, must, be, pursued, with, caution, while, eliminating, unwanted, or, harmful, effects, as, no, one, abstains, from, cooking, food, worrying, about, beggars, who, ask, for, it, or, restrain, from, sowing, wheat, fearing, animals, that, destroy, the, crop, similarly, claims, vatsyayana, one, must, pursue, kama, even, though, dangers, exist, and, those, who, are, accomplished, in, dharma, artha, and, kama,
