of, riding, driving, and, vaulting, this, broad, description, includes, the, use, of, horses, for, practical, working, purposes, transportation, recreational, activities, artistic, or, cultural, exercises, and, competitive, sport, horses, are, trained, and, ridden, for, practical, working, purposes, such, as, in, police, work, or, for, controlling, herd, animals, on, a, ranch, they, are, also, used, in, competitive, sports, including, dressage, endurance, riding, eventing, reining, show, jumping, tent, pegging, vaulting, polo, horse, racing, driving, and, rodeo, see, additional, equestrian, sports, listed, later, in, this, article, for, more, examples, some, popular, forms, of, competition, are, grouped, together, at, horse, shows, where, horses, perform, in, a, wide, variety, of, disciplines, horses, and, other, equids, such, as, mules, are, used, for, non, competitive, recreational, riding, such, as, fox, hunting, trail, riding, or, hacking, there, is, public, access, to, horse, trails, in, almost, every, part, of, the, world, many, parks, ranches, and, public, stables, offer, both, guided, and, independent, riding, horses, are, also, used, for, therapeutic, purposes, both, in, specialized, para, equestrian, competition, as, well, as, non, competitive, riding, to, improve, human, health, and, emotional, development, horses, are, also, driven, in, harness, racing, at, horse, shows, and, in, other, types, of, exhibition, such, as, historical, reenactment, or, ceremony, often, pulling, carriages, in, some, parts, of, the, world, they, are, still, used, for, practical, purposes, such, as, farming, horses, continue, to, be, used, in, public, service, in, traditional, ceremonies, parades, funerals, police, and, volunteer, mounted, patrols, and, for, mounted, search, and, rescue, riding, halls, also, known, as, indoor, arenas, or, schools, enable, training, of, horse, and, rider, in, all, weathers, as, well, as, indoor, competition, riding, though, there, is, controversy, over, the, exact, date, horses, were, domesticated, and, when, they, were, first, ridden, the, best, estimate, is, that, horses, first, were, ridden, approximately, 3500, bc, there, is, some, evidence, that, about, 3, 000, bc, near, the, dnieper, river, and, the, don, river, people, were, using, bits, on, horses, as, a, stallion, that, was, buried, there, shows, teeth, wear, consistent, with, using, a, bit, however, the, most, unequivocal, early, archaeological, evidence, of, equines, put, to, working, use, was, of, horses, being, driven, chariot, burials, about, 2500, bc, present, the, most, direct, hard, evidence, of, horses, used, as, working, animals, in, ancient, times, chariot, warfare, was, followed, by, the, use, of, war, horses, as, light, and, heavy, cavalry, the, horse, played, an, important, role, throughout, human, history, all, over, the, world, both, in, warfare, and, in, peaceful, pursuits, such, as, transportation, trade, and, agriculture, horses, lived, in, north, america, but, died, out, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, horses, were, brought, back, to, north, america, by, european, explorers, beginning, with, the, second, voyage, of, columbus, in, 1493, equestrianism, was, introduced, in, the, 1900, summer, olympics, as, an, olympic, sport, with, jumping, events, humans, appear, to, have, long, expressed, a, desire, to, know, which, horse, or, horses, were, the, fastest, and, horse, racing, has, ancient, roots, gambling, on, horse, races, appears, to, go, hand, in, hand, with, racing, and, has, a, long, history, as, well, thoroughbreds, have, the, pre, eminent, reputation, as, a, racing, breed, but, other, breeds, also, race, under, saddle, in, harness, distance, racing, equestrian, events, were, first, included, in, the, modern, olympic, games, in, 1900, by, 1912, all, three, olympic, disciplines, still, seen, today, were, part, of, the, games, the, following, forms, of, competition, are, recognized, worldwide, and, are, a, part, of, the, equestrian, events, at, the, olympics, they, are, governed, by, the, rules, of, the, international, federation, for, equestrian, sports, fei, the, additional, internationally, sanctioned, but, non, olympic, disciplines, governed, by, the, fei, are, combined, driving, endurance, reining, and, vaulting, these, disciplines, are, part, of, the, fei, world, equestrian, games, every, four, years, and, may, hold, their, own, individual, world, championships, in, other, years, the, fei, also, recognizes, horseball, and, tent, pegging, as, its, two, regional, disciplines, para, equestrian, competition, at, the, international, level, including, the, paralympics, are, also, governed, by, the, fei, and, offer, the, following, competition, events, the, haute, cole, f, high, school, an, advanced, component, of, classical, dressage, is, a, highly, refined, set, of, skills, seldom, used, in, competition, but, often, seen, in, demonstration, performances, the, world, s, leading, classical, dressage, programs, include, other, major, classical, teams, include, the, south, african, lipizzaners, and, the, hollandsche, manege, of, the, netherlands, horse, shows, are, held, throughout, the, world, with, a, tremendous, variety, of, possible, events, equipment, attire, and, judging, standards, used, however, most, forms, of, horse, show, competition, can, be, broken, into, the, following, broad, categories, in, addition, to, the, classical, olympic, events, the, following, forms, of, competition, are, seen, in, north, america, they, are, referred, to, as, english, riding, in, contrast, with, western, riding, elsewhere, in, the, world, if, a, distinction, is, necessary, they, are, usually, described, as, classic, riding, there, is, no, horn, western, riding, evolved, from, the, cattle, working, and, warfare, traditions, brought, to, the, americas, by, the, spanish, settlers, and, both, equipment, and, riding, style, evolved, to, meet, the, working, needs, of, the, cowboy, on, ranches, in, the, american, west, the, most, noticeable, feature, of, western, style, riding, is, the, western, saddle, which, has, a, substantial, saddle, tree, that, provides, support, to, horse, and, rider, when, working, long, hours, in, the, saddle, the, western, saddle, features, a, prominent, pommel, topped, by, a, horn, a, knob, used, for, dallying, a, lariat, after, roping, an, animal, wide, stirrups, and, in, some, cases, both, front, and, back, cinches, the, depth, of, the, seat, may, depend, on, the, activity, a, deeper, seat, used, for, barrel, racing, or, cutting, cows, or, a, more, shallow, seat, for, general, ranch, riding, or, steer, wrestling, finished, western, horses, are, asked, to, perform, with, a, loose, rein, controlled, by, one, hand, the, headstall, of, a, western, bridle, may, utilize, either, a, snaffle, bit, or, curb, bit, bitless, headstalls, are, also, seen, such, as, a, bosal, style, hackamore, on, younger, horses, or, various, styles, of, mechanical, hackamore, in, vaquero, style, training, a, combination, of, a, bosal, and, bit, called, a, two, rein, is, used, at, some, stages, of, training, the, standard, western, bridle, lacks, a, noseband, and, usually, consists, of, a, single, set, of, reins, attached, to, a, curb, bit, that, has, somewhat, longer, shanks, than, the, curb, of, an, english, weymouth, bridle, or, a, pelham, bit, western, bridles, have, either, a, browband, or, else, a, one, ear, loop, sometimes, two, that, crosses, in, front, of, the, horse, s, ear, two, styles, of, western, reins, developed, the, long, split, reins, of, the, texas, tradition, which, are, completely, separated, or, the, romal, reins, of, the, california, tradition, which, are, closed, reins, with, a, long, single, attachment, the, romal, that, can, be, used, as, a, quirt, modern, rodeo, competitors, in, timed, events, sometimes, use, a, closed, rein, without, a, romal, western, riders, wear, a, long, sleeved, shirt, long, pants, or, jeans, cowboy, boots, and, a, wide, brimmed, cowboy, hat, a, rider, may, wear, protective, leather, leggings, called, chaps, riders, may, wear, brighter, colors, or, finer, fabrics, in, competition, than, for, work, in, particular, horse, show, events, such, as, western, pleasure, may, much, flashier, equipment, saddles, bits, and, bridles, are, ornamented, with, substantial, amounts, of, silver, rider, clothing, may, have, vivid, colors, and, even, rhinestones, or, sequins, horses, ponies, mules, and, donkeys, are, driven, in, harness, in, many, different, ways, for, working, purposes, they, can, pull, a, plow, or, other, farm, equipment, designed, to, be, pulled, by, animals, in, many, parts, of, the, world, they, still, pull, wagons, for, basic, hauling, and, transportation, they, may, draw, carriages, at, ceremonies, in, parades, or, for, tourist, rides, as, noted, in, horse, racing, above, horses, can, race, in, harness, pulling, a, very, lightweight, cart, known, as, a, sulky, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, some, draft, horses, compete, in, horse, pulling, competitions, where, single, or, teams, of, horses, and, their, drivers, vie, to, determine, who, can, pull, the, most, weight, for, a, short, distance, in, horse, show, competition, the, following, general, categories, of, competition, are, seen, rodeo, events, include, the, following, forms, of, competition, roping, includes, a, number, of, timed, events, that, are, based, on, the, real, life, tasks, of, a, working, cowboy, who, often, had, to, capture, calves, and, adult, cattle, for, branding, medical, treatment, and, other, purposes, a, lasso, or, lariat, is, thrown, over, the, head, of, a, calf, or, the, horns, of, adult, cattle, and, the, animal, is, secured, in, a, fashion, dictated, by, its, size, and, age, in, spite, of, popular, myth, most, modern, broncs, are, not, in, fact, wild, horses, but, are, more, commonly, spoiled, riding, horses, or, horses, bred, specifically, as, bucking, stock, there, are, many, other, forms, of, equestrian, activity, and, sports, seen, worldwide, there, are, both, competitive, events, and, pleasure, riding, disciplines, available, handling, riding, and, driving, horses, have, inherent, risks, horses, are, large, prey, animals, with, a, well, developed, flight, or, fight, instinct, able, to, move, quickly, and, unexpectedly, when, mounted, the, rider, s, head, may, be, up, to, 4, m, 13, ft, from, the, ground, and, the, horse, may, travel, at, a, speed, of, up, to, 65, km, h, 40, mph, the, injuries, observed, range, from, very, minor, injuries, to, fatalities, a, study, in, germany, reported, that, the, relative, risk, of, injury, from, riding, a, horse, compared, to, riding, a, bicycle, was, 9, times, higher, for, adolescents, and, 5, 6, times, higher, for, younger, children, but, that, riding, a, horse, was, less, risky, than, riding, a, moped, in, victoria, australia, a, search, of, state, records, found, that, equestrian, sports, had, the, third, highest, incidence, of, serious, injury, after, motor, sports, and, power, boating, in, greece, an, analysis, of, a, national, registry, estimated, the, incidence, of, equestrian, injury, to, be, 21, per, 100, 000, person, years, for, farming, and, equestrian, sports, combined, and, 160, times, higher, for, horse, racing, personnel, other, findings, noted, that, helmets, likely, prevent, traumatic, brain, injuries, in, the, united, states, each, year, an, estimated, 30, million, people, ride, horses, resulting, in, 50, 000, emergency, department, visits, 1, visit, per, 600, riders, per, year, a, survey, of, 679, equestrians, in, oregon, washington, and, idaho, estimated, that, at, some, time, in, their, equestrian, career, one, in, five, will, be, seriously, injured, resulting, in, hospitalization, surgery, or, long, term, disability, among, survey, respondents, novice, equestrians, had, an, incidence, of, any, injury, that, was, threefold, over, intermediates, fivefold, over, advanced, equestrians, and, nearly, eightfold, over, professionals, approximately, 100, hours, of, experience, are, required, to, achieve, a, substantial, decline, in, the, risk, of, injury, the, survey, authors, conclude, that, efforts, to, prevent, equestrian, injury, should, focus, on, novice, equestrians, the, most, common, injury, is, falling, from, the, horse, followed, by, being, kicked, trampled, and, bitten, about, 3, out, of, 4, injuries, are, due, to, falling, broadly, defined, a, broad, definition, of, falling, often, includes, being, crushed, and, being, thrown, from, the, horse, but, when, reported, separately, each, of, these, mechanisms, may, be, more, common, than, being, kicked, in, canada, a, 10, year, study, of, trauma, center, patients, injured, while, riding, reported, that, although, 48, had, suffered, head, injuries, only, 9, of, these, riders, had, been, wearing, helmets, at, the, time, of, their, accident, other, injuries, involved, the, chest, 54, abdomen, 22, and, extremities, 17, a, german, study, reported, that, injuries, in, horse, riding, are, rare, compared, to, other, sports, but, when, they, occur, they, are, severe, specifically, they, found, that, 40, of, horse, riding, injuries, were, fractures, and, only, 15, were, sprains, furthermore, the, study, noted, that, in, germany, one, quarter, of, all, sport, related, fatalities, are, caused, by, horse, riding, most, horse, related, injuries, are, a, result, of, falling, from, a, horse, which, is, the, cause, of, 60, 80, of, all, such, reported, injuries, another, common, cause, of, injury, is, being, kicked, by, a, horse, which, may, cause, skull, fractures, or, severe, trauma, to, the, internal, organs, some, possible, injuries, resulting, from, horse, riding, with, the, percent, indicating, the, amounts, in, relation, to, all, injuries, as, reported, by, a, new, zealand, study, include, among, 36, members, and, employees, of, the, hong, kong, jockey, club, who, were, seen, in, a, trauma, center, during, a, period, of, 5, years, 24, fell, from, horses, and, 11, were, kicked, by, the, horse, injuries, comprised, 18, torso, 11, head, face, or, neck, and, 11, limb, the, authors, of, this, study, recommend, that, helmets, face, shields, and, body, protectors, be, worn, when, riding, or, handling, horses, in, new, south, wales, australia, a, study, of, equestrians, seen, at, one, hospital, over, a, 6, year, period, found, that, 81, were, wearing, a, helmet, at, the, time, of, injury, and, that, helmet, use, both, increased, over, time, and, was, correlated, with, a, lower, rate, of, admission, in, the, second, half, of, the, study, period, of, the, equestrians, seen, at, a, hospital, only, 14, were, admitted, in, contrast, a, study, of, child, equestrians, seen, at, a, hospital, emergency, department, in, adelaide, reported, that, 60, were, admitted, in, the, united, states, an, analysis, of, national, electronic, injury, surveillance, system, neiss, data, performed, by, the, equestrian, medical, safety, association, studied, 78, 279, horse, related, injuries, in, 2007, the, most, common, injuries, included, fractures, 28, 5, contusions, abrasions, 28, 3, strain, sprain, 14, 5, internal, injury, 8, 1, lacerations, 5, 7, concussions, 4, 6, dislocations, 1, 9, and, hematomas, 1, 2, most, frequent, injury, sites, are, the, lower, trunk, 19, 6, head, 15, 0, upper, trunk, 13, 4, shoulder, 8, 2, and, wrist, 6, 8, within, this, study, patients, were, treated, and, released, 86, 2, were, hospitalized, 8, 7, were, transferred, 3, 6, left, without, being, treated, 0, 8, remained, for, observation, 0, 6, and, arrived, at, the, hospital, deceased, 0, 1, horseback, riding, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, sports, especially, in, relation, to, head, injury, statistics, from, the, united, states, for, example, indicate, that, about, 30, million, people, ride, horses, annually, on, average, about, 67, 000, people, are, admitted, to, the, hospital, each, year, from, injuries, sustained, while, working, with, horses, 15, 000, of, those, admittances, are, from, traumatic, brain, injuries, of, those, about, 60, die, each, year, from, their, brain, injuries, studies, have, found, horseback, riding, to, be, more, dangerous, than, several, sports, including, skiing, auto, racing, and, football, horseback, riding, has, a, higher, hospital, admittance, rate, per, hours, of, riding, than, motorcycle, racing, at, 0, 49, per, thousand, hours, of, riding, and, 0, 14, accidents, per, thousand, hours, respectively, head, injuries, are, especially, traumatic, in, horseback, riding, about, two, thirds, of, all, riders, requiring, hospitalization, after, a, fall, have, sustained, a, traumatic, brain, injury, falling, from, a, horse, without, wearing, a, helmet, is, comparable, to, being, struck, by, a, car, most, falling, deaths, are, caused, by, head, injury, the, use, of, riding, helmets, substantially, decreases, the, likelihood, and, severity, of, head, injuries, when, a, rider, falls, with, a, helmet, he, or, she, is, five, times, less, likely, to, experience, a, traumatic, brain, injury, than, a, rider, who, falls, without, a, helmet, helmets, work, by, crushing, on, impact, and, extending, the, length, of, time, it, takes, the, head, to, stop, moving, despite, this, helmet, usage, rates, in, north, america, are, estimated, to, be, between, eight, and, twenty, percent, once, a, helmet, has, sustained, an, impact, from, falling, that, part, of, the, helmet, is, structurally, weakened, even, if, no, visible, damage, is, present, helmet, manufacturers, recommend, that, a, helmet, that, has, undergone, impact, from, a, fall, be, replaced, immediately, in, addition, helmets, should, be, replaced, every, three, to, five, years, specific, recommendations, vary, by, manufacturer, many, organizations, mandate, helmet, use, in, competition, or, on, show, grounds, and, rules, have, continually, moved, in, the, direction, of, requiring, helmet, use, in, 2011, the, united, states, equestrian, federation, passed, a, rule, making, helmet, use, mandatory, while, mounted, on, competition, grounds, at, u, s, nationally, rated, eventing, competitions, also, in, 2011, the, united, states, dressage, federation, made, helmet, use, in, competition, mandatory, for, all, riders, under, 18, and, all, riders, who, are, riding, any, test, at, fourth, level, and, below, if, a, rider, competing, at, prix, st, georges, and, above, is, also, riding, a, test, at, fourth, level, or, below, he, or, she, must, also, wear, a, helmet, at, all, times, while, mounted, the, idea, that, riding, a, horse, astride, could, injure, a, woman, s, sex, organs, is, a, historic, but, sometimes, popular, even, today, misunderstanding, or, misconception, particularly, that, riding, astride, can, damage, the, hymen, evidence, of, injury, to, any, female, sex, organs, is, scant, in, female, high, level, athletes, trauma, to, the, perineum, is, rare, and, is, associated, with, certain, sports, see, pelvic, floor, clinical, significance, the, type, of, trauma, associated, with, equestrian, sports, has, been, termed, horse, riders, perineum, a, case, series, of, 4, female, mountain, bike, riders, and, 2, female, horse, riders, found, both, patient, reported, perineal, pain, and, evidence, of, sub, clinical, changes, in, the, clitoris, the, relevance, of, these, findings, to, horse, riding, is, unknown, in, men, sports, related, injuries, are, among, the, major, causes, of, testicular, trauma, in, a, small, controlled, but, unblinded, study, of, 52, men, varicocele, was, significantly, more, common, in, equestrians, than, in, non, equestrians, the, difference, between, these, two, groups, was, small, however, compared, to, differences, reported, between, extreme, mountain, bike, riders, and, non, riders, and, also, between, mountain, bike, riders, and, on, road, bicycle, riders, horse, riding, injuries, to, the, scrotum, contusions, and, testes, blunt, trauma, were, well, known, to, surgeons, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, injuries, from, collision, with, the, pommel, of, a, saddle, are, mentioned, specifically, organized, welfare, groups, such, as, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, and, animal, rights, groups, such, as, people, for, the, ethical, treatment, of, animals, have, been, known, to, criticise, some, horse, sports, with, claims, of, animal, cruelty, horse, racing, is, a, popular, equestrian, sport, which, is, practiced, in, many, nations, around, the, world, it, is, inextricably, associated, with, gambling, where, in, certain, events, stakes, can, become, very, high, despite, its, illegality, in, most, competitions, these, conditions, of, extreme, competitiveness, can, lead, to, the, use, of, performing, enhancing, drugs, and, extreme, training, techniques, which, can, result, in, negative, side, effects, for, the, horses, well, being, the, races, themselves, have, also, proved, dangerous, to, the, horses, especially, steeplechasing, which, requires, the, horse, to, jump, hurdles, whilst, galloping, at, full, speed, this, can, result, in, injury, or, death, to, the, horse, as, well, as, the, jockey, a, study, by, animal, welfare, group, animal, aid, revealed, that, approximately, 375, racehorses, die, yearly, with, 30, of, these, either, during, or, as, a, result, of, injuries, from, a, race, the, report, also, highlighted, the, increasing, frequency, of, race, related, illnesses, including, bleeding, lungs, exercise, induced, pulmonary, hemorrhage, and, gastric, ulcers, animal, rights, groups, are, also, primarily, concerned, that, certain, sports, or, training, exercises, may, cause, unnecessary, pain, or, injuries, to, horse, athletes, some, specific, training, or, showing, practices, are, so, widely, condemned, that, they, have, been, made, illegal, at, the, national, level, and, violations, can, incur, criminal, penalties, the, most, well, known, is, soring, a, practice, of, applying, a, caustic, ointment, just, above, the, hooves, of, a, tennessee, walking, horse, to, make, it, pick, up, its, feet, higher, however, in, spite, of, a, federal, law, in, the, united, states, prohibiting, this, practice, and, routine, inspections, of, horse, shows, by, inspectors, from, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, soring, is, still, widespread, and, difficult, to, eliminate, some, events, themselves, are, also, considered, so, abusive, that, they, are, banned, in, many, countries, among, these, are, horse, tripping, a, sport, where, riders, chase, and, rope, a, loose, running, horse, by, its, front, legs, throwing, it, to, the, ground, secondary, effects, of, racing, have, also, recently, been, uncovered, a, 2006, investigation, by, the, observer, in, the, uk, found, that, each, year, 6, 000, 10, 000, horses, are, slaughtered, for, consumption, abroad, a, significant, proportion, of, which, are, horses, bred, for, racing, a, boom, in, the, number, of, foals, bred, has, meant, that, there, is, not, adequate, resources, to, care, for, unwanted, horses, demand, has, increased, for, this, massive, breeding, programme, to, be, scaled, back, despite, over, 1000, foals, being, produced, annually, by, the, thoroughbred, horse, industry, 66, of, those, bred, for, such, a, purpose, were, never, entered, into, a, race, and, despite, a, life, expectancy, of, 30, years, many, are, killed, before, their, fifth, birthday, horse, riding, events, have, been, selected, as, a, main, motif, in, numerous, collectors, coins, one, of, the, recent, samples, is, the, 10, greek, horse, riding, commemorative, coin, minted, in, 2003, to, commemorate, the, 2004, summer, olympics, on, the, composition, of, the, obverse, of, this, coin, the, modern, horseman, is, pictured, as, he, jumps, over, an, obstacle, while, in, the, background, the, ancient, horseman, is, inspired, by, a, representation, on, a, black, figure, vase, of, the, 5th, century, bc, for, the, 2012, olympics, the, royal, mint, has, produced, a, 50p, coin, showing, a, horse, jumping, a, fence
