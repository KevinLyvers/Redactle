of, ice, hockey, was, developed, in, canada, most, notably, in, montreal, where, the, first, indoor, game, was, played, on, march, 3, 1875, some, characteristics, of, that, game, such, as, the, length, of, the, ice, rink, and, the, use, of, a, puck, have, been, retained, to, this, day, amateur, ice, hockey, leagues, began, in, the, 1880s, and, professional, ice, hockey, originated, around, 1900, the, stanley, cup, emblematic, of, ice, hockey, club, supremacy, was, initially, commissioned, in, 1892, as, the, dominion, hockey, challenge, cup, and, was, first, awarded, in, 1893, to, recognise, the, canadian, amateur, champion, and, later, became, the, championship, trophy, of, the, national, hockey, league, nhl, in, the, early, 1900s, the, canadian, rules, were, adopted, by, the, ligue, internationale, de, hockey, sur, glace, in, paris, france, the, precursor, to, the, international, ice, hockey, federation, iihf, the, sport, was, played, for, the, first, time, at, the, olympics, during, the, 1920, summer, games, today, it, is, a, mainstay, at, the, winter, olympics, in, 1994, ice, hockey, was, officially, recognized, as, canada, s, national, winter, sport, while, women, also, played, during, the, game, s, early, formative, years, it, was, not, until, organizers, began, to, officially, remove, body, checking, from, female, ice, hockey, beginning, in, the, mid, 1980s, that, it, began, to, gain, greater, popularity, which, by, then, had, spread, to, europe, and, a, variety, of, other, countries, the, first, iihf, women, s, world, championship, was, held, in, 1990, and, women, s, play, was, introduced, into, the, olympics, in, 1998, ice, hockey, is, believed, to, have, evolved, from, simple, stick, and, ball, games, played, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, britain, ireland, and, elsewhere, primarily, bandy, hurling, and, shinty, the, north, american, sport, of, lacrosse, was, also, influential, these, games, were, brought, to, north, america, and, several, similar, winter, games, using, informal, rules, developed, such, as, shinny, and, ice, polo, but, later, were, absorbed, into, a, new, organized, game, with, codified, rules, which, today, is, ice, hockey, while, the, general, characteristics, of, the, game, remain, constant, the, exact, rules, depend, on, the, particular, code, of, play, being, used, the, two, most, important, codes, are, those, of, the, iihf, and, the, nhl, both, of, these, codes, and, others, originated, from, canadian, rules, of, ice, hockey, of, the, early, 20th, century, ice, hockey, is, played, on, a, hockey, rink, during, normal, play, there, are, six, players, on, ice, skates, on, the, ice, per, side, one, of, them, being, the, goaltender, the, objective, of, the, game, is, to, score, goals, by, shooting, a, hard, vulcanized, rubber, disc, the, puck, into, the, opponent, s, goal, net, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, rink, the, players, use, their, sticks, to, pass, or, shoot, the, puck, with, certain, restrictions, players, may, redirect, the, puck, with, any, part, of, their, body, players, may, not, hold, the, puck, in, their, hand, and, are, prohibited, from, using, their, hands, to, pass, the, puck, to, their, teammates, unless, they, are, in, the, defensive, zone, players, can, knock, a, puck, out, of, the, air, with, their, hands, to, themselves, players, are, prohibited, from, kicking, the, puck, into, the, opponent, s, goal, though, unintentional, redirections, off, the, skate, are, permitted, players, may, not, intentionally, bat, the, puck, into, the, net, with, their, hands, hockey, is, an, off, side, game, meaning, that, forward, passes, are, allowed, unlike, in, rugby, before, the, 1930s, hockey, was, an, on, side, game, meaning, that, only, backward, passes, were, allowed, those, rules, emphasized, individual, stick, handling, to, drive, the, puck, forward, with, the, arrival, of, offside, rules, the, forward, pass, transformed, hockey, into, a, true, team, sport, where, individual, performance, diminished, in, importance, relative, to, team, play, which, could, now, be, coordinated, over, the, entire, surface, of, the, ice, as, opposed, to, merely, rearward, players, the, six, players, on, each, team, are, typically, divided, into, three, forwards, two, defencemen, and, one, goaltender, the, term, skaters, typically, applies, to, all, players, except, goaltenders, the, forward, positions, consist, of, a, centre, and, two, wingers, a, left, wing, and, a, right, wing, forwards, often, play, together, as, units, or, lines, with, the, same, three, forwards, always, playing, together, the, defencemen, usually, stay, together, as, a, pair, generally, divided, between, left, and, right, left, and, right, side, wingers, or, defencemen, are, generally, positioned, on, the, side, on, which, they, carry, their, stick, a, substitution, of, an, entire, unit, at, once, is, called, a, line, change, teams, typically, employ, alternate, sets, of, forward, lines, and, defensive, pairings, when, short, handed, or, on, a, power, play, the, goaltender, stands, in, a, usually, blue, semi, circle, called, the, crease, in, the, defensive, zone, keeping, pucks, out, of, the, goal, substitutions, are, permitted, at, any, time, during, the, game, although, during, a, stoppage, of, play, the, home, team, is, permitted, the, final, change, when, players, are, substituted, during, play, it, is, called, changing, on, the, fly, an, nhl, rule, added, in, the, 2005, 06, season, prevents, a, team, from, changing, their, line, after, they, ice, the, puck, the, boards, surrounding, the, ice, help, keep, the, puck, in, play, and, they, can, also, be, used, as, tools, to, play, the, puck, players, are, permitted, to, bodycheck, opponents, into, the, boards, to, stop, progress, the, referees, linesmen, and, the, outsides, of, the, goal, are, in, play, and, do, not, stop, the, game, when, the, puck, or, players, either, bounce, into, or, collide, with, them, play, can, be, stopped, if, the, goal, is, knocked, out, of, position, play, often, proceeds, for, minutes, without, interruption, after, a, stoppage, play, is, restarted, with, a, faceoff, two, players, face, each, other, and, an, official, drops, the, puck, to, the, ice, where, the, two, players, attempt, to, gain, control, of, the, puck, markings, circles, on, the, ice, indicate, the, locations, for, the, faceoff, and, guide, the, positioning, of, players, three, major, rules, of, play, in, ice, hockey, limit, the, movement, of, the, puck, offside, icing, and, the, puck, going, out, of, play, under, iihf, rules, each, team, may, carry, a, maximum, of, 20, players, and, two, goaltenders, on, their, roster, nhl, rules, restrict, the, total, number, of, players, per, game, to, 18, plus, two, goaltenders, in, the, nhl, the, players, are, usually, divided, into, four, lines, of, three, forwards, and, into, three, pairs, of, defencemen, on, occasion, teams, may, elect, to, substitute, an, extra, defenceman, for, a, forward, the, seventh, defenceman, may, play, as, a, substitute, defenceman, spend, the, game, on, the, bench, or, if, a, team, chooses, to, play, four, lines, then, this, seventh, defenceman, may, see, ice, time, on, the, fourth, line, as, a, forward, a, professional, ice, hockey, game, consists, of, three, periods, of, twenty, minutes, the, clock, running, only, when, the, puck, is, in, play, the, teams, change, ends, after, each, period, of, play, including, overtime, recreational, leagues, and, children, s, leagues, often, play, shorter, games, generally, with, three, shorter, periods, of, play, if, a, tie, occurs, in, tournament, play, as, well, as, in, the, nhl, playoffs, north, americans, favour, sudden, death, overtime, in, which, the, teams, continue, to, play, twenty, minute, periods, until, a, goal, is, scored, up, until, the, 1999, 2000, season, regular, season, nhl, games, were, settled, with, a, single, five, minute, sudden, death, period, with, five, players, plus, a, goalie, per, side, with, both, teams, awarded, one, point, in, the, standings, in, the, event, of, a, tie, with, a, goal, the, winning, team, would, be, awarded, two, points, and, the, losing, team, none, just, as, if, they, had, lost, in, regulation, the, total, elapsed, time, from, when, the, puck, first, drops, is, about, 2, hours, and, 20, minutes, for, a, 60, minute, game, from, the, 1999, 2000, until, the, 2003, 04, seasons, the, national, hockey, league, decided, ties, by, playing, a, single, five, minute, sudden, death, overtime, period, with, each, team, having, four, skaters, per, side, plus, the, goalie, in, the, event, of, a, tie, each, team, would, still, receive, one, point, in, the, standings, but, in, the, event, of, a, victory, the, winning, team, would, be, awarded, two, points, in, the, standings, and, the, losing, team, one, point, the, idea, was, to, discourage, teams, from, playing, for, a, tie, since, previously, some, teams, might, have, preferred, a, tie, and, 1, point, to, risking, a, loss, and, zero, points, the, exception, to, this, rule, is, if, a, team, opts, to, pull, their, goalie, in, exchange, for, an, extra, skater, during, overtime, and, is, subsequently, scored, upon, an, empty, net, goal, in, which, case, the, losing, team, receives, no, points, for, the, overtime, loss, since, the, 2015, 16, season, the, single, five, minute, sudden, death, overtime, session, involves, three, skaters, on, each, side, since, three, skaters, must, always, be, on, the, ice, in, an, nhl, game, the, consequences, of, penalties, are, slightly, different, from, those, during, regulation, play, any, penalty, during, overtime, that, would, result, in, a, team, losing, a, skater, during, regulation, instead, causes, the, other, side, to, add, a, skater, once, the, penalized, team, s, penalty, ends, the, penalized, skater, exits, the, penalty, box, and, the, teams, continue, at, 4, on, 4, until, the, next, stoppage, of, play, at, which, point, the, teams, return, to, three, skaters, per, side, international, play, and, several, north, american, professional, leagues, including, the, nhl, in, the, regular, season, now, use, an, overtime, period, identical, to, that, from, 1999, 2000, to, 2003, 04, followed, by, a, penalty, shootout, if, the, score, remains, tied, after, an, extra, overtime, period, the, subsequent, shootout, consists, of, three, players, from, each, team, taking, penalty, shots, after, these, six, total, shots, the, team, with, the, most, goals, is, awarded, the, victory, if, the, score, is, still, tied, the, shootout, then, proceeds, to, sudden, death, regardless, of, the, number, of, goals, scored, by, either, team, during, the, shootout, the, final, score, recorded, will, award, the, winning, team, one, more, goal, than, the, score, at, the, end, of, regulation, time, in, the, nhl, if, a, game, is, decided, in, overtime, or, by, a, shootout, the, winning, team, is, awarded, two, points, in, the, standings, and, the, losing, team, is, awarded, one, point, ties, no, longer, occur, in, the, nhl, overtime, in, the, nhl, playoffs, differs, from, the, regular, season, in, the, playoffs, there, are, no, shootouts, if, a, game, is, tied, after, regulation, then, a, 20, minute, period, of, 5, on, 5, sudden, death, overtime, will, be, added, if, the, game, is, still, tied, after, the, overtime, another, period, is, added, until, a, team, scores, which, wins, the, match, since, 2019, the, iihf, world, championships, and, the, gold, medal, game, in, the, olympics, use, the, same, format, but, in, a, 3, on, 3, format, in, ice, hockey, infractions, of, the, rules, lead, to, a, play, stoppage, whereby, the, play, is, restarted, at, a, faceoff, some, infractions, result, in, a, penalty, on, a, player, or, team, in, the, simplest, case, the, offending, player, is, sent, to, the, penalty, box, and, their, team, must, play, with, one, less, player, on, the, ice, for, a, designated, time, minor, penalties, last, for, two, minutes, major, penalties, last, for, five, minutes, and, a, double, minor, penalty, is, two, consecutive, penalties, of, two, minutes, duration, a, single, minor, penalty, may, be, extended, by, two, minutes, for, causing, visible, injury, to, the, victimized, player, this, is, usually, when, blood, is, drawn, during, high, sticking, players, may, be, also, assessed, personal, extended, penalties, or, game, expulsions, for, misconduct, in, addition, to, the, penalty, or, penalties, their, team, must, serve, the, team, that, has, been, given, a, penalty, is, said, to, be, playing, short, handed, while, the, opposing, team, is, on, a, power, play, a, two, minute, minor, penalty, is, often, charged, for, lesser, infractions, such, as, tripping, elbowing, roughing, high, sticking, delay, of, the, game, too, many, players, on, the, ice, boarding, illegal, equipment, charging, leaping, into, an, opponent, or, body, checking, him, after, taking, more, than, two, strides, holding, holding, the, stick, grabbing, an, opponent, s, stick, interference, hooking, slashing, kneeing, unsportsmanlike, conduct, arguing, a, penalty, call, with, referee, extremely, vulgar, or, inappropriate, verbal, comments, butt, ending, striking, an, opponent, with, the, knob, of, the, stick, spearing, jabbing, an, opponent, with, the, blade, of, the, stick, or, cross, checking, as, of, the, 2005, 2006, season, a, minor, penalty, is, also, assessed, for, diving, where, a, player, embellishes, or, simulates, an, offence, more, egregious, fouls, may, be, penalized, by, a, four, minute, double, minor, penalty, particularly, those, that, injure, the, victimized, player, these, penalties, end, either, when, the, time, runs, out, or, when, the, other, team, scores, during, the, power, play, in, the, case, of, a, goal, scored, during, the, first, two, minutes, of, a, double, minor, the, penalty, clock, is, set, down, to, two, minutes, upon, a, score, effectively, expiring, the, first, minor, penalty, five, minute, major, penalties, are, called, for, especially, violent, instances, of, most, minor, infractions, that, result, in, intentional, injury, to, an, opponent, or, when, a, minor, penalty, results, in, visible, injury, such, as, bleeding, as, well, as, for, fighting, major, penalties, are, always, served, in, full, they, do, not, terminate, on, a, goal, scored, by, the, other, team, major, penalties, assessed, for, fighting, are, typically, offsetting, meaning, neither, team, is, short, handed, and, the, players, exit, the, penalty, box, upon, a, stoppage, of, play, following, the, expiration, of, their, respective, penalties, the, foul, of, boarding, defined, as, check, an, opponent, in, such, a, manner, that, causes, the, opponent, to, be, thrown, violently, in, the, boards, is, penalized, either, by, a, minor, or, major, penalty, at, the, discretion, of, the, referee, based, on, the, violent, state, of, the, hit, a, minor, or, major, penalty, for, boarding, is, often, assessed, when, a, player, checks, an, opponent, from, behind, and, into, the, boards, some, varieties, of, penalty, do, not, require, the, offending, team, to, play, a, man, short, concurrent, five, minute, major, penalties, in, the, nhl, usually, result, from, fighting, in, the, case, of, two, players, being, assessed, five, minute, fighting, majors, both, the, players, serve, five, minutes, without, their, team, incurring, a, loss, of, player, both, teams, still, have, a, full, complement, of, players, on, the, ice, this, differs, with, two, players, from, opposing, sides, getting, minor, penalties, at, the, same, time, or, at, any, intersecting, moment, resulting, from, more, common, infractions, in, this, case, both, teams, will, have, only, four, skating, players, not, counting, the, goaltender, until, one, or, both, penalties, expire, if, one, penalty, expires, before, the, other, the, opposing, team, gets, a, power, play, for, the, remainder, of, the, time, this, applies, regardless, of, current, pending, penalties, in, the, nhl, a, team, always, has, at, least, three, skaters, on, the, ice, thus, ten, minute, misconduct, penalties, are, served, in, full, by, the, penalized, player, but, his, team, may, immediately, substitute, another, player, on, the, ice, unless, a, minor, or, major, penalty, is, assessed, in, conjunction, with, the, misconduct, a, two, and, ten, or, five, and, ten, in, this, case, the, team, designates, another, player, to, serve, the, minor, or, major, both, players, go, to, the, penalty, box, but, only, the, designee, may, not, be, replaced, and, he, is, released, upon, the, expiration, of, the, two, or, five, minutes, at, which, point, the, ten, minute, misconduct, begins, in, addition, game, misconducts, are, assessed, for, deliberate, intent, to, inflict, severe, injury, on, an, opponent, at, the, officials, discretion, or, for, a, major, penalty, for, a, stick, infraction, or, repeated, major, penalties, the, offending, player, is, ejected, from, the, game, and, must, immediately, leave, the, playing, surface, he, does, not, sit, in, the, penalty, box, meanwhile, if, an, additional, minor, or, major, penalty, is, assessed, a, designated, player, must, serve, out, of, that, segment, of, the, penalty, in, the, box, similar, to, the, above, mentioned, two, and, ten, in, some, rare, cases, a, player, may, receive, up, to, nineteen, minutes, in, penalties, for, one, string, of, plays, this, could, involve, receiving, a, four, minute, double, minor, penalty, getting, in, a, fight, with, an, opposing, player, who, retaliates, and, then, receiving, a, game, misconduct, after, the, fight, in, this, case, the, player, is, ejected, and, two, teammates, must, serve, the, double, minor, and, major, penalties, a, penalty, shot, is, awarded, to, a, player, when, the, illegal, actions, of, another, player, stop, a, clear, scoring, opportunity, most, commonly, when, the, player, is, on, a, breakaway, a, penalty, shot, allows, the, obstructed, player, to, pick, up, the, puck, on, the, centre, red, line, and, attempt, to, score, on, the, goalie, with, no, other, players, on, the, ice, to, compensate, for, the, earlier, missed, scoring, opportunity, a, penalty, shot, is, also, awarded, for, a, defender, other, than, the, goaltender, covering, the, puck, in, the, goal, crease, a, goaltender, intentionally, displacing, his, own, goal, posts, during, a, breakaway, to, avoid, a, goal, a, defender, intentionally, displacing, his, own, goal, posts, when, there, is, less, than, two, minutes, to, play, in, regulation, time, or, at, any, point, during, overtime, or, a, player, or, coach, intentionally, throwing, a, stick, or, other, object, at, the, puck, or, the, puck, carrier, and, the, throwing, action, disrupts, a, shot, or, pass, play, officials, also, stop, play, for, puck, movement, violations, such, as, using, one, s, hands, to, pass, the, puck, in, the, offensive, end, but, no, players, are, penalized, for, these, offences, the, sole, exceptions, are, deliberately, falling, on, or, gathering, the, puck, to, the, body, carrying, the, puck, in, the, hand, and, shooting, the, puck, out, of, play, in, one, s, defensive, zone, all, penalized, two, minutes, for, delay, of, game, in, the, nhl, a, unique, penalty, applies, to, the, goalies, the, goalies, now, are, forbidden, to, play, the, puck, in, the, corners, of, the, rink, near, their, own, net, this, will, result, in, a, two, minute, penalty, against, the, goalie, s, team, only, in, the, area, in, front, of, the, goal, line, and, immediately, behind, the, net, marked, by, two, red, lines, on, either, side, of, the, net, can, the, goalie, play, the, puck, an, additional, rule, that, has, never, been, a, penalty, but, was, an, infraction, in, the, nhl, before, recent, rules, changes, is, the, two, line, offside, pass, prior, to, the, 2005, 06, nhl, season, play, was, stopped, when, a, pass, from, inside, a, team, s, defending, zone, crossed, the, centre, line, with, a, face, off, held, in, the, defending, zone, of, the, offending, team, now, the, centre, line, is, no, longer, used, in, the, nhl, to, determine, a, two, line, pass, infraction, a, change, that, the, iihf, had, adopted, in, 1998, players, are, now, able, to, pass, to, teammates, who, are, more, than, the, blue, and, centre, ice, red, line, away, the, nhl, has, taken, steps, to, speed, up, the, game, of, hockey, and, create, a, game, of, finesse, by, reducing, the, number, of, illegal, hits, fights, and, clutching, and, grabbing, that, occurred, in, the, past, rules, are, now, more, strictly, enforced, resulting, in, more, penalties, which, provides, more, protection, to, the, players, and, facilitates, more, goals, being, scored, the, governing, body, for, united, states, amateur, hockey, has, implemented, many, new, rules, to, reduce, the, number, of, stick, on, body, occurrences, as, well, as, other, detrimental, and, illegal, facets, of, the, game, zero, tolerance, in, men, s, hockey, but, not, in, women, s, a, player, may, use, his, hip, or, shoulder, to, hit, another, player, if, the, player, has, the, puck, or, is, the, last, to, have, touched, it, this, use, of, the, hip, and, shoulder, is, called, body, checking, not, all, physical, contact, is, legal, in, particular, hits, from, behind, hits, to, the, head, and, most, types, of, forceful, stick, on, body, contact, are, illegal, a, delayed, penalty, call, occurs, when, an, offence, is, committed, by, the, team, that, does, not, have, possession, of, the, puck, in, this, circumstance, the, team, with, possession, of, the, puck, is, allowed, to, complete, the, play, that, is, play, continues, until, a, goal, is, scored, a, player, on, the, opposing, team, gains, control, of, the, puck, or, the, team, in, possession, commits, an, infraction, or, penalty, of, their, own, because, the, team, on, which, the, penalty, was, called, cannot, control, the, puck, without, stopping, play, it, is, impossible, for, them, to, score, a, goal, in, these, cases, the, team, in, possession, of, the, puck, can, pull, the, goalie, for, an, extra, attacker, without, fear, of, being, scored, on, it, is, possible, for, the, controlling, team, to, mishandle, the, puck, into, their, own, net, if, a, delayed, penalty, is, signalled, and, the, team, in, possession, scores, the, penalty, is, still, assessed, to, the, offending, player, but, not, served, in, 2012, this, rule, was, changed, by, the, united, states, national, collegiate, athletic, association, ncaa, for, college, level, hockey, in, college, games, the, penalty, is, still, enforced, even, if, the, team, in, possession, scores, a, typical, game, of, hockey, is, governed, by, two, to, four, officials, on, the, ice, charged, with, enforcing, the, rules, of, the, game, there, are, typically, two, linesmen, who, are, mainly, responsible, for, calling, offside, and, icing, violations, breaking, up, fights, and, conducting, faceoffs, and, one, or, two, referees, who, call, goals, and, all, other, penalties, linesmen, can, report, to, the, referee, s, that, a, penalty, should, be, assessed, against, an, offending, player, in, some, situations, the, restrictions, on, this, practice, vary, depending, on, the, governing, rules, on, ice, officials, are, assisted, by, off, ice, officials, who, act, as, goal, judges, time, keepers, and, official, scorers, the, most, widespread, system, is, the, three, man, system, which, uses, one, referee, and, two, linesmen, a, less, commonly, used, system, is, the, two, referee, and, one, linesman, system, this, system, is, close, to, the, regular, three, man, system, except, for, a, few, procedure, changes, beginning, with, the, national, hockey, league, a, number, of, leagues, have, implemented, the, four, official, system, where, an, additional, referee, is, added, to, aid, in, the, calling, of, penalties,

while, a, shallow, curve, allows, for, easier, backhand, shots, the, flex, of, the, stick, also, impacts, the, performance, typically, a, less, flexible, stick, is, meant, for, a, stronger, player,

alert, lacerations, to, the, head, scalp, and, face, are, the, most, frequent, types, of, injury, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, head, injury, is, body, checking, from, behind, due, to, the, danger, of, delivering, a, check, from, behind, many, leagues, including, the, nhl, have, made, this, a, major, and, game, misconduct, penalty, another, type, of, check, that, accounts, for, many, of, the, player, to, player, contact, concussions, is, a, check, to, the, head, resulting, in, a, misconduct, penalty, called, head, contact, in, recent, years, the, nhl, has, implemented, new, rules, which, penalize, and, suspend, players, for, illegal, checks, to, the, heads, as, well, as, checks, to, unsuspecting, players, studies, show, that, ice, hockey, causes, 44, 3, of, all, sports, related, traumatic, brain, injuries, among, canadian, children, some, teams, in, the, swiss, national, league, are, testing, out, systems, that, combine, helmet, integrated, sensors, and, analysis, software, to, reveal, a, player, s, ongoing, brain, injury, risk, during, a, game, these, sensors, provide, players, and, coaches, with, real, time, data, on, head, impact, strength, frequency, and, severity, furthermore, if, the, app, determines, that, a, particular, impact, has, the, potential, to, cause, brain, injury, it, will, alert, the, coach, who, can, in, turn, seek, medical, attention, for, the, individual, defensive, ice, hockey, tactics, vary, from, more, active, to, more, conservative, styles, of, play, one, distinction, is, between, man, to, man, oriented, defensive, systems, and, zonal, oriented, defensive, systems, though, a, lot, of, teams, use, a, combination, between, the, two, defensive, skills, involve, pass, interception, shot, blocking, and, stick, checking, in, which, an, attempt, to, take, away, the, puck, or, cut, off, the, puck, lane, is, initiated, by, the, stick, of, the, defensive, player, tactical, points, of, emphasis, in, ice, hockey, defensive, play, are, concepts, like, managing, gaps, gap, control, boxing, out, not, letting, the, offensive, team, go, on, the, inside, and, staying, on, the, right, side, of, the, puck, another, popular, concept, in, ice, hockey, defensive, tactics, is, that, of, playing, a, 200, foot, game, an, important, defensive, tactic, is, checking, attempting, to, take, the, puck, from, an, opponent, or, to, remove, the, opponent, from, play, stick, checking, sweep, checking, and, poke, checking, are, legal, uses, of, the, stick, to, obtain, possession, of, the, puck, the, neutral, zone, trap, is, designed, to, isolate, the, puck, carrier, in, the, neutral, zone, preventing, him, from, entering, the, offensive, zone, body, checking, is, using, one, s, shoulder, or, hip, to, strike, an, opponent, who, has, the, puck, or, who, is, the, last, to, have, touched, it, the, last, person, to, have, touched, the, puck, is, still, legally, in, possession, of, it, although, a, penalty, is, generally, called, if, he, is, checked, more, than, two, seconds, after, his, last, touch, body, checking, is, also, a, penalty, in, certain, leagues, in, order, to, reduce, the, chance, of, injury, to, players, often, the, term, checking, is, used, to, refer, to, body, checking, with, its, true, definition, generally, only, propagated, among, fans, of, the, game, one, of, the, most, important, strategies, for, a, team, is, their, forecheck, forechecking, is, the, act, of, attacking, the, opposition, in, their, defensive, zone, forechecking, is, an, important, part, of, the, dump, and, chase, strategy, i, e, shooting, the, puck, into, the, offensive, zone, and, then, chasing, after, it, each, team, uses, their, own, unique, system, but, the, main, ones, are, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, and, 1, 4, the, 2, 1, 2, is, the, most, basic, forecheck, system, where, two, forwards, go, in, deep, and, pressure, the, opposition, s, defencemen, the, third, forward, stays, high, and, the, two, defencemen, stay, at, the, blueline, the, 1, 2, 2, is, a, bit, more, conservative, system, where, one, forward, pressures, the, puck, carrier, and, the, other, two, forwards, cover, the, oppositions, wingers, with, the, two, defencemen, staying, at, the, blueline, the, 1, 4, is, the, most, defensive, forecheck, system, referred, to, as, the, neutral, zone, trap, where, one, forward, applies, pressure, to, the, puck, carrier, around, the, oppositions, blueline, and, the, other, four, players, stand, basically, in, a, line, by, their, blueline, in, hopes, the, opposition, will, skate, into, one, of, them, another, strategy, is, the, left, wing, lock, which, has, two, forwards, pressure, the, puck, and, the, left, wing, and, the, two, defencemen, stay, at, the, blueline, offensive, tactics, include, improving, a, team, s, position, on, the, ice, by, advancing, the, puck, out, of, one, s, zone, towards, the, opponent, s, zone, progressively, by, gaining, lines, first, your, own, blue, line, then, the, red, line, and, finally, the, opponent, s, blue, line, nhl, rules, instated, for, the, 2006, season, redefined, the, offside, rule, to, make, the, two, line, pass, legal, a, player, may, pass, the, puck, from, behind, his, own, blue, line, past, both, that, blue, line, and, the, centre, red, line, to, a, player, on, the, near, side, of, the, opponents, blue, line, offensive, tactics, are, designed, ultimately, to, score, a, goal, by, taking, a, shot, when, a, player, purposely, directs, the, puck, towards, the, opponent, s, goal, he, or, she, is, said, to, shoot, the, puck, a, deflection, is, a, shot, that, redirects, a, shot, or, a, pass, towards, the, goal, from, another, player, by, allowing, the, puck, to, strike, the, stick, and, carom, towards, the, goal, a, one, timer, is, a, shot, struck, directly, off, a, pass, without, receiving, the, pass, and, shooting, in, two, separate, actions, headmanning, the, puck, also, known, as, breaking, out, is, the, tactic, of, rapidly, passing, to, the, player, farthest, down, the, ice, loafing, also, known, as, cherry, picking, is, when, a, player, usually, a, forward, skates, behind, an, attacking, team, instead, of, playing, defence, in, an, attempt, to, create, an, easy, scoring, chance, a, team, that, is, losing, by, one, or, two, goals, in, the, last, few, minutes, of, play, will, often, elect, to, pull, the, goalie, that, is, remove, the, goaltender, and, replace, him, or, her, with, an, extra, attacker, on, the, ice, in, the, hope, of, gaining, enough, advantage, to, score, a, goal, this, is, a, desperate, act, as, it, sometimes, leads, to, the, opposing, team, extending, their, lead, by, scoring, a, goal, in, the, empty, net, there, are, many, other, little, tactics, used, in, the, game, of, hockey, cycling, moves, the, puck, along, the, boards, in, the, offensive, zone, to, create, a, scoring, chance, by, making, defenders, tired, or, moving, them, out, of, position, pinching, is, when, a, defenceman, pressures, the, opposition, s, winger, in, the, offensive, zone, when, they, are, breaking, out, attempting, to, stop, their, attack, and, keep, the, puck, in, the, offensive, zone, a, saucer, pass, is, a, pass, used, when, an, opposition, s, stick, or, body, is, in, the, passing, lane, it, is, the, act, of, raising, the, puck, over, the, obstruction, and, having, it, land, on, a, teammate, s, stick, a, deke, short, for, decoy, is, a, feint, with, the, body, or, stick, to, fool, a, defender, or, the, goalie, many, modern, players, such, as, pavel, datsyuk, sidney, crosby, and, patrick, kane, have, picked, up, the, skill, of, dangling, which, is, fancier, deking, and, requires, more, stick, handling, skills, although, fighting, is, officially, prohibited, in, the, rules, it, is, not, an, uncommon, occurrence, at, the, professional, level, and, its, prevalence, has, been, both, a, target, of, criticism, and, a, considerable, draw, for, the,
