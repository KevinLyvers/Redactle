to, mix, drinks, or, the, bon, vivant, s, companion, which, included, 10, cocktail, recipes, using, bitters, to, differentiate, from, other, drinks, such, as, punches, and, cobblers, cocktails, continued, to, evolve, and, gain, popularity, throughout, the, 1900s, with, the, term, eventually, expanding, to, cover, all, mixed, drinks, in, 1917, the, term, cocktail, party, was, coined, by,

common, item, in, liquor, stores, in, the, modern, world, and, the, information, age, cocktail, recipes, are, widely, shared, online, on, websites, cocktails, and, restaurants, that, serve, them, are, frequently, covered, and, reviewed, in, tourism, magazines, and, guides, some, cocktails, such, as, the, mojito, manhattan, and, martini, have, become, staples, in, restaurants, and, pop, culture, the, term, cocktail, can, refer, to, a, wide, variety, of, drinks, it, is, typically, a, mixed, drink, containing, alcohol, when, a, combined, drink, contains, only, a, distilled, spirit, and, a, mixer, such, as, soda, or, fruit, juice, it, is, a, highball, many, of, the, international, bartenders, association, official, cocktails, are, highballs, when, a, mixed, drink, contains, only, a,

various, herbs, mixed, drinks, without, alcohol, that, resemble, cocktails, can, be, known, as, zero, proof, or, virgin, cocktails, or, mocktails, the, origin, of, the, word, cocktail, is, disputed, it, is, presumably, from, cock, tail, meaning, with, tail, standing, up, like, a, cock, s, in, particular, of, a, horse, but, how, this, came, to, be, applied, to, alcoholic, mixed, drinks, is, unclear, the, most, prominent, theories, are, that, it, refers, to, a, simulant, hence, a, simulating, drink, or, to, a, non, purebred, horse, hence, a, mixed, drink, cocktail, historian, david, wondrich, speculates, that, cocktail, is, a, reference, to, gingering, a, practice, for, perking, up, an, old, horse, by, means, of, a, ginger, suppository, so, that, the, animal, would, cock, its, tail, up, and, be, frisky, hence, by, extension, a, simulating, drink, like, pick, me, up, this, agrees, with, usage, in, early, citations, 1798, cock, tail, vulgarly, called, ginger, 1803, drink, at, 11, a, m, to, clear, the, head, 1806, stimulating, liquor, and, suggests, that, a, cocktail, was, initially, considered, a, medicinal, drink, which, accords, with, the, use, of, bitters, etymologist, anatoly, liberman, endorses, as, highly, probable, the, theory, advanced, by, l, ftman, 1946, which, liberman, summarizes, as, follows, it, was, customary, to, dock, the, tails, of, horses, that, were, not, thoroughbred, they, were, called, cocktailed, horses, later, simply, cocktails, by, extension, the, word, cocktail, was, applied, to, a, vulgar, ill, bred, person, raised, above, his, station, assuming, the, position, of, a, gentleman, but, deficient, in, gentlemanly, breeding, of, importance, is, the, mention, of, water, as, an, ingredient, l, ftman, concluded, that, cocktail, was, an, acceptable, alcoholic, drink, but, diluted, not, a, purebred, a, thing, raised, above, its, station, hence, the, highly, appropriate, slang, word, used, earlier, about, inferior, horses, and, sham, gentlemen, the, first, recorded, use, of, cocktail, not, referring, to, a, horse, is, found, in, the, morning, post, and, gazetteer, in, london, england, march, 20, 1798, mr, pitt, two, petit,

stimulating, liquor, composed, of, spirits, of, any, kind, sugar, water, and, bitters, it, is, vulgarly, called, bittered, sling, and, is, supposed, to, be, an, excellent, electioneering, potion, in, as, much, as, it, renders, the, heart, stout, and, bold, at, the, same, time, that, it, fuddles, the, head, it, is, said, also, to, be, of, great, use, to, a, democratic, candidate, because, a, person, having, swallowed, a, glass, of, it, is, ready, to, swallow, any, thing, else, other, origins, have, been, suggested, as, corruptions, of, other, words, or, phrases, these, can, be, dismissed, as, folk, etymologies, given, the, well, attested, term, cock, tail, for, a, horse, dale, degroff, hypothesizes, that, the, word, evolved, from, the, french, coquetier, for, an, eggcup, in, which, antoine, a, peychaud, creator, of, peychaud, s, bitters, allegedly, used, to, serve, his, guests, a, mix, of, cognac, with, a, dash, of, his, bitters, several, authors, have, theorized, that, cocktail, may, be, a, corruption, of, cock, ale, there, is, a, lack, of, clarity, on, the, origins, of, cocktails, traditionally, cocktails, were, a, mixture, of, spirits, sugar, water, and, bitters, by, the, 1860s, however, a, cocktail, frequently, included, a, liqueur, the, first, publication, of, a, bartenders, guide, which, included, cocktail, recipes, was, in, 1862, how, to, mix, drinks, or,

10, recipes, for, cocktails, a, key, ingredient, distinguishing, cocktails, from, other, drinks, in, this, compendium, was, the, use, of, bitters, mixed, drinks, popular, today, that, conform, to, this, original, meaning, of, cocktail, include, the, old, fashioned, whiskey, cocktail, the, sazerac, cocktail, and, the, manhattan, cocktail, the, ingredients, listed, spirits, sugar, water, and, bitters, match, the, ingredients, of, an, old, fashioned, which, originated, as, a, term, used, by, late, 19th, century, bar, patrons, to, distinguish, cocktails, made, the, old, fashioned, way, from, newer, more, complex, cocktails, in, the, 1869, recipe, book, cooling, cups, and, dainty, drinks, by, william, terrington, cocktails, are, described, as, cocktails, are, compounds, very, much, used,

archdiocese, of, st, louis, bought, the, walsh, mansion, at, 4510, lindell, boulevard, and, it, has, served, as, the, local, archbishop, s, residence, ever, since, during, prohibition, in, the, united, states, 1920, 1933, when, alcoholic, beverages, were, illegal, cocktails, were, still, consumed, illegally, in, establishments, known, as, speakeasies, the, quality, of, the, liquor, available, during, prohibition, was, much, worse, than, previously, there, was, a, shift, from, whiskey, to, gin, which, does, not, require, aging, and, is, therefore, easier, to, produce, illicitly,
