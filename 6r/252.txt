sexual, behaviours, and, desires, at, points, in, their, menstrual, cycle, as, a, means, to, ensure, that, they, attract, a, high, quality, mate, to, copulate, with, during, their, most, fertile, time, hormone, levels, throughout, the, menstrual, cycle, affect, a, woman, s, overt, behaviours, influencing, the, way, a, woman, presents, herself, to, others, during, stages, of, her, menstrual, cycle, in, an, attempt, to, attract, high, quality, mates, the, closer, the, woman, is, to, ovulation, human, sexuality, has, many, aspects, in, biology, sexuality, describes, the, reproductive, mechanism, and, the, basic, biological, drive, that, exists, in, all, sexually, reproducing, species, and, can, encompass, sexual, intercourse, and, sexual, contact, in, all, its, forms, there, are, also, emotional, and, physical, aspects, of, sexuality, these, relate, to, the, bond, between, individuals, which, may, be, expressed, through, profound, feelings, or, emotions, sociologically, it, can, cover, the, cultural, political, and, legal, aspects, philosophically, it, can, span, the, moral, ethical, theological, spiritual, and, religious, aspects, which, aspects, of, a, person, s, sexuality, attract, another, is, influenced, by, cultural, factors, it, has, varied, over, time, as, well, as, personal, factors, influencing, factors, may, be, determined, more, locally, among, sub, cultures, across, sexual, fields, or, simply, by, the, preferences, of, the, individual, these, preferences, come, about, as, a, result, of, a, complex, variety, of, genetic, psychological, and, cultural, factors, a, person, s, physical, appearance, has, a, critical, impact, on, their, sexual, attractiveness, this, involves, the, impact, one, s, appearance, has, on, the, senses, especially, in, the, beginning, of, a, relationship, among, them, as, with, other, animals, pheromones, may, have, an, impact, though, less, significantly, in, the, case, of, humans, theoretically, the, wrong, pheromone, may, cause, someone, to, be, disliked, even, when, they, would, otherwise, appear, attractive, frequently, a, pleasant, smelling, perfume, is, used, to, encourage, the, other, person, to, more, deeply, inhale, the, air, surrounding, its, wearer, increasing, the, probability, that, the, individual, s, pheromones, will, be, inhaled, the, importance, of, pheromones, in, human, relationships, is, probably, limited, and, is, widely, disputed, although, it, appears, to, have, some, scientific, basis, some, people, exhibit, high, levels, of, sexual, fetishism, and, are, sexually, stimulated, by, other, stimuli, not, normally, associated, with, sexual, arousal, the, degree, to, which, such, fetishism, exists, or, has, existed, in, different, cultures, is, controversial, pheromones, have, been, determined, to, play, a, role, in, sexual, attraction, between, people, they, influence, gonadal, hormone, secretion, for, example, follicle, maturation, in, the, ovaries, in, females, and, testosterone, and, sperm, production, in, males, research, conducted, by, donald, g, dutton, and, arthur, p, aron, in, the, 1970s, aimed, to, find, the, relation, between, sexual, attraction, and, high, anxiety, conditions, in, doing, so, 85, male, participants, were, contacted, by, an, attractive, female, interviewer, at, either, a, fear, arousing, suspension, bridge, or, a, normal, bridge, conclusively, it, was, shown, that, the, male, participants, who, were, asked, by, the, female, interviewer, to, perform, the, thematic, apperception, test, tat, on, the, fear, arousing, bridge, wrote, more, sexual, content, in, the, stories, and, attempted, with, greater, effort, to, contact, the, interviewer, after, the, experiment, than, those, participants, who, performed, the, tat, on, the, normal, bridge, in, another, test, a, male, participant, chosen, from, a, group, of, 80, was, given, anticipated, shocks, with, him, was, an, attractive, female, confederate, who, was, also, being, shocked, the, experiment, showed, that, the, male, s, sexual, imagery, in, the, tat, was, much, higher, when, self, shock, was, anticipated, and, not, when, the, female, confederate, shock, was, anticipated, people, consciously, or, subconsciously, enhance, their, sexual, attractiveness, or, sex, appeal, for, a, number, of, reasons, it, may, be, to, attract, someone, with, whom, they, can, form, a, deeper, relationship, for, companionship, procreation, or, an, intimate, relationship, besides, other, possible, purposes, it, can, be, part, of, a, courtship, process, this, can, involve, physical, aspects, or, interactive, processes, whereby, people, find, and, attract, potential, partners, and, maintain, a, relationship, these, processes, which, involve, attracting, a, partner, and, maintaining, sexual, interest, can, include, flirting, which, can, be, used, to, attract, the, sexual, attention, of, another, to, encourage, romance, or, sexual, relations, and, can, involve, body, language, conversation, joking, or, brief, physical, contact, men, have, been, found, to, have, a, greater, interest, in, uncommitted, sex, compared, to, women, some, research, shows, this, interest, to, be, more, sociological, than, biological, men, have, a, greater, interest, in, visual, sexual, stimuli, than, women, however, additional, trends, have, been, found, with, a, greater, sensitivity, to, partner, status, in, women, choosing, a, sexual, partner, and, men, placing, a, greater, emphasis, on, physical, attractiveness, in, a, potential, mate, as, well, as, a, significantly, greater, tendency, toward, sexual, jealousy, in, men, and, emotional, jealousy, in, women, bailey, gaulin, agyei, and, gladue, 1994, analyzed, whether, these, results, varied, according, to, sexual, orientation, in, general, they, found, biological, sex, played, a, bigger, role, in, the, psychology, of, sexual, attraction, than, orientation, however, there, were, some, differences, between, homosexual, and, heterosexual, women, and, men, on, these, factors, while, gay, and, straight, men, showed, similar, psychological, interest, in, casual, sex, on, markers, of, sociosexuality, gay, men, showed, a, larger, number, of, partners, in, behaviour, expressing, this, interest, proposed, to, be, due, to, a, difference, in, opportunity, self, identified, lesbian, women, showed, a, significantly, greater, interest, in, visual, sexual, stimuli, than, heterosexual, women, and, judged, partner, status, to, be, less, important, in, romantic, partnerships, heterosexual, men, had, a, significantly, greater, preference, for, younger, partners, than, homosexual, men, people, who, identify, as, asexual, may, not, be, sexually, attracted, to, anyone, gray, asexuality, includes, those, who, only, experience, sexual, attraction, under, certain, circumstances, for, example, exclusively, after, an, emotional, bond, has, been, formed, this, tends, to, vary, from, person, to, person, the, ovulatory, shift, hypothesis, is, the, theory, that, female, humans, tend, to, exhibit, different, sexual, behaviours, and, desires, at, points, in, their, cycle, two, meta, analyses, published, in, 2014, reached, opposing, conclusions, on, whether, the, existing, evidence, was, robust, enough, to, support, the, prediction, that, women, s, mate, preferences, change, across, the, cycle, a, newer, 2018, review, does, not, show, women, changing, the, type, of, men, they, desire, at, different, times, in, their, fertility, cycle, in, males, a, masculine, face, has, been, positively, correlated, with, fewer, respiratory, diseases, and, as, a, consequence, masculine, features, offer, a, marker, of, health, and, reproductive, success, hormone, levels, throughout, the, menstrual, cycle, affect, a, woman, s, behaviour, in, preferences, and, in, their, overt, behaviours, the, ornamentation, effect, is, a, phenomenon, influenced, by, a, stage, of, the, menstrual, cycle, which, refers, to, the, way, a, woman, presents, herself, to, others, in, a, way, to, attract, potential, sexual, partners, studies, have, found, that, the, closer, women, were, to, ovulation, the, more, provocatively, they, dress, and, the, more, attractive, they, are, rated, it, is, possible, that, women, are, sensitive, to, the, changes, in, their, physical, attractiveness, throughout, their, cycles, such, that, at, their, most, fertile, stages, their, levels, of, attractiveness, are, increased, consequently, they, choose, to, display, their, increased, levels, of, attractiveness, through, this, method, of, ornamentation, during, periods, of, hormonal, imbalance, women, exhibit, a, peak, in, sexual, activity, as, these, findings, have, been, recorded, for, female, initiated, sexual, activity, and, not, for, male, initiated, activity, the, causation, appears, to, be, hormonal, changes, during, the, menstrual, cycle, research, has, also, found, that, menstrual, cycles, affect, sexual, behaviour, frequency, in, pre, menopausal, women, for, example, women, who, had, weekly, sexual, intercourse, with, men, had, menstrual, cycles, with, the, average, duration, of, 29, days, while, women, with, less, frequent, sexual, interactions, tended, to, have, more, extreme, cycle, lengths, changes, in, hormones, during, a, female, s, cycles, affect, the, way, she, behaves, and, the, way, males, behave, towards, her, research, has, found, that, men, are, a, lot, more, attentive, and, loving, towards, their, partners, when, they, are, in, the, most, fertile, phase, of, their, cycles, in, comparison, to, when, they, are, in, the, luteal, phases, men, become, increasingly, jealous, and, possessive, over, their, partners, during, this, stage
