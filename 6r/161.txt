in, anthropology, kinship, is, the, web, of, social, relationships, that, form, an, important, part, of, the, lives, of, all, humans, in, all, societies, although, its, exact, meanings, even, within, this, discipline, are, often, debated, anthropologist, robin, fox, says, that, the, study, of, kinship, is, the, study, of, what, humans, do, with, these, basic, facts, of, life, mating, gestation, parenthood, socialization, siblingship, etc, human, society, is, unique, he, argues, in, that, we, are, working, with, the, same, raw, material, as, exists, in, the, animal, world, but, can, conceptualize, and, categorize, it, to, serve, social, ends, these, social, ends, include, the, socialization, of, children, and, the, formation, of, basic, economic, political, and, religious, groups, kinship, can, refer, both, to, the, patterns, of, social, relationships, themselves, or, it, can, refer, to, the, study, of, the, patterns, of, social, relationships, in, one, or, more, human, cultures, i, e, kinship, studies, over, its, history, anthropology, has, developed, a, number, of, related, concepts, and, terms, in, the, study, of, kinship, such, as, descent, descent, group, lineage, affinity, affine, consanguinity, cognate, and, fictive, kinship, further, even, within, these, two, broad, usages, of, the, term, there, are, different, theoretical, approaches, broadly, kinship, patterns, may, be, considered, to, include, people, related, by, both, descent, i, e, social, relations, during, development, and, by, marriage, human, kinship, relations, through, marriage, are, commonly, called, affinity, in, contrast, to, the, relationships, that, arise, in, one, s, group, of, origin, which, may, be, called, one, s, descent, group, in, some, cultures, kinship, relationships, may, be, considered, to, extend, out, to, people, an, individual, has, economic, or, political, relationships, with, or, other, forms, of, social, connections, within, a, culture, some, descent, groups, may, be, considered, to, lead, back, to, gods, or, animal, ancestors, totems, this, may, be, conceived, of, on, a, more, or, less, literal, basis, kinship, can, also, refer, to, a, principle, by, which, individuals, or, groups, of, individuals, are, organized, into, social, groups, roles, categories, and, genealogy, by, means, of, kinship, terminologies, family, relations, can, be, represented, concretely, mother, brother, grandfather, or, abstractly, by, degrees, of, relationship, kinship, distance, a, relationship, may, be, relative, e, g, a, father, in, relation, to, a, child, or, reflect, an, absolute, e, g, the, difference, between, a, mother, and, a, childless, woman, degrees, of, relationship, are, not, identical, to, heirship, or, legal, succession, many, codes, of, ethics, consider, the, bond, of, kinship, as, creating, obligations, between, the, related, persons, stronger, than, those, between, strangers, as, in, confucian, filial, piety, in, a, more, general, sense, kinship, may, refer, to, a, similarity, or, affinity, between, entities, on, the, basis, of, some, or, all, of, their, characteristics, that, are, under, focus, this, may, be, due, to, a, shared, ontological, origin, a, shared, historical, or, cultural, connection, or, some, other, perceived, shared, features, that, connect, the, two, entities, for, example, a, person, studying, the, ontological, roots, of, human, languages, etymology, might, ask, whether, there, is, kinship, between, the, english, word, seven, and, the, german, word, sieben, it, can, be, used, in, a, more, diffuse, sense, as, in, for, example, the, news, headline, madonna, feels, kinship, with, vilified, wallis, simpson, to, imply, a, felt, similarity, or, empathy, between, two, or, more, entities, in, biology, kinship, typically, refers, to, the, degree, of, genetic, relatedness, or, the, coefficient, of, relationship, between, individual, members, of, a, species, e, g, as, in, kin, selection, theory, it, may, also, be, used, in, this, specific, sense, when, applied, to, human, relationships, in, which, case, its, meaning, is, closer, to, consanguinity, or, genealogy, family, is, a, group, of, people, affiliated, by, consanguinity, by, recognized, birth, affinity, by, marriage, or, co, residence, shared, consumption, see, nurture, kinship, in, most, societies, it, is, the, principal, institution, for, the, socialization, of, children, as, the, basic, unit, for, raising, children, anthropologists, most, generally, classify, family, organization, as, matrifocal, a, mother, and, her, children, conjugal, a, husband, his, wife, and, children, also, called, nuclear, family, avuncular, a, brother, his, sister, and, her, children, or, extended, family, in, which, parents, and, children, co, reside, with, other, members, of, one, parent, s, family, however, producing, children, is, not, the, only, function, of, the, family, in, societies, with, a, sexual, division, of, labor, marriage, and, the, resulting, relationship, between, two, people, it, is, necessary, for, the, formation, of, an, economically, productive, household, different, societies, classify, kinship, relations, differently, and, therefore, use, different, systems, of, kinship, terminology, for, example, some, languages, distinguish, between, affinal, and, consanguine, uncles, whereas, others, have, only, one, word, to, refer, to, both, a, father, and, his, brothers, kinship, terminologies, include, the, terms, of, address, used, in, different, languages, or, communities, for, different, relatives, and, the, terms, of, reference, used, to, identify, the, relationship, of, these, relatives, to, ego, or, to, each, other, kin, terminologies, can, be, either, descriptive, or, classificatory, when, a, descriptive, terminology, is, used, a, term, refers, to, only, one, specific, type, of, relationship, while, a, classificatory, terminology, groups, many, different, types, of, relationships, under, one, term, for, example, the, word, brother, in, english, speaking, societies, indicates, a, son, of, one, s, same, parent, thus, english, speaking, societies, use, the, word, brother, as, a, descriptive, term, referring, to, this, relationship, only, in, many, other, classificatory, kinship, terminologies, in, contrast, a, person, s, male, first, cousin, whether, mother, s, brother, s, son, mother, s, sister, s, son, father, s, brother, s, son, father, s, sister, s, son, may, also, be, referred, to, as, brothers, the, major, patterns, of, kinship, systems, that, are, known, which, lewis, henry, morgan, identified, through, kinship, terminology, in, his, 1871, work, systems, of, consanguinity, and, affinity, of, the, human, family, are, there, is, a, seventh, type, of, system, only, identified, as, distinct, later, the, six, types, crow, eskimo, hawaiian, iroquois, omaha, sudanese, that, are, not, fully, classificatory, dravidian, australian, are, those, identified, by, murdock, 1949, prior, to, lounsbury, s, 1964, rediscovery, of, the, linguistic, principles, of, classificatory, kin, terms, while, normal, kin, terms, discussed, above, denote, a, relationship, between, two, entities, e, g, the, word, sister, denotes, the, relationship, between, the, speaker, or, some, other, entity, and, another, feminine, entity, who, shares, the, parents, of, the, former, trirelational, kin, terms, also, known, as, triangular, triadic, ternary, and, shared, kin, terms, denote, a, relationship, between, three, distinct, entities, these, occur, commonly, in, australian, aboriginal, languages, with, the, context, of, australian, aboriginal, kinship, in, bininj, kunwok, for, example, the, bi, relational, kin, term, nakurrng, is, differentiated, from, its, tri, relational, counterpart, by, the, position, of, the, possessive, pronoun, ke, when, nakurrng, is, anchored, to, the, addressee, with, ke, in, the, second, position, it, simply, means, brother, which, includes, a, broader, set, of, relations, than, in, english, when, the, ke, is, fronted, however, the, term, nakurrng, now, incorporates, the, male, speaker, as, a, propositus, p, i, e, point, of, reference, for, a, kin, relation, and, encapsulates, the, entire, relationship, as, follows, many, australian, languages, also, have, elaborate, systems, of, referential, terms, for, denoting, groups, of, people, based, on, their, relationship, to, one, another, not, just, their, relationship, to, the, speaker, or, an, external, propositus, like, grandparents, for, example, in, kuuk, thaayorre, a, maternal, grandfather, and, his, sister, are, referred, to, as, paanth, ngan, ngethe, and, addressed, with, the, vocative, ngethin, in, bardi, a, father, and, his, sister, are, irrmoorrgooloo, a, man, s, wife, and, his, children, are, aalamalarr, in, murrinh, patha, nonsingular, pronouns, are, differentiated, not, only, by, the, gender, makeup, of, the, group, but, also, by, the, members, interrelation, if, the, members, are, in, a, sibling, like, relation, a, third, pronoun, sib, will, be, chosen, distinct, from, the, masculine, masc, and, feminine, neuter, fem, in, many, societies, where, kinship, connections, are, important, there, are, rules, though, they, may, be, expressed, or, be, taken, for, granted, there, are, four, main, headings, that, anthropologists, use, to, categorize, rules, of, descent, they, are, bilateral, unilineal, ambilineal, and, double, descent, a, descent, group, is, a, social, group, whose, members, talk, about, common, ancestry, a, unilineal, society, is, one, in, which, the, descent, of, an, individual, is, reckoned, either, from, the, mother, s, or, the, father, s, line, of, descent, matrilineal, descent, is, based, on, relationship, to, females, of, the, family, line, a, child, would, not, be, recognized, with, their, father, s, family, in, these, societies, but, would, be, seen, as, a, member, of, their, mother, s, family, s, line, simply, put, individuals, belong, to, their, mother, s, descent, group, matrilineal, descent, includes, the, mother, s, brother, who, in, some, societies, may, pass, along, inheritance, to, the, sister, s, children, or, succession, to, a, sister, s, son, conversely, with, patrilineal, descent, individuals, belong, to, their, father, s, descent, group, children, are, recognized, as, members, of, their, father, s, family, and, descent, is, based, on, relationship, to, males, of, the, family, line, societies, with, the, iroquois, kinship, system, are, typically, unilineal, while, the, iroquois, proper, are, specifically, matrilineal, in, a, society, which, reckons, descent, bilaterally, bilineal, descent, is, reckoned, through, both, father, and, mother, without, unilineal, descent, groups, societies, with, the, eskimo, kinship, system, like, the, inuit, yupik, and, most, western, societies, are, typically, bilateral, the, egocentric, kindred, group, is, also, typical, of, bilateral, societies, additionally, the, batek, people, of, malaysia, recognize, kinship, ties, through, both, parents, family, lines, and, kinship, terms, indicate, that, neither, parent, nor, their, families, are, of, more, or, less, importance, than, the, other, some, societies, reckon, descent, patrilineally, for, some, purposes, and, matrilineally, for, others, this, arrangement, is, sometimes, called, double, descent, for, instance, certain, property, and, titles, may, be, inherited, through, the, male, line, and, others, through, the, female, line, societies, can, also, consider, descent, to, be, ambilineal, such, as, hawaiian, kinship, where, offspring, determine, their, lineage, through, the, matrilineal, line, or, the, patrilineal, line, a, lineage, is, a, unilineal, descent, group, that, can, demonstrate, their, common, descent, from, a, known, apical, ancestor, unilineal, lineages, can, be, matrilineal, or, patrilineal, depending, on, whether, they, are, traced, through, mothers, or, fathers, respectively, whether, matrilineal, or, patrilineal, descent, is, considered, most, significant, differs, from, culture, to, culture, a, clan, is, generally, a, descent, group, claiming, common, descent, from, an, apical, ancestor, often, the, details, of, parentage, are, not, important, elements, of, the, clan, tradition, non, human, apical, ancestors, are, called, totems, examples, of, clans, are, found, in, chechen, chinese, irish, japanese, polish, scottish, tlingit, and, somali, societies, a, phratry, is, a, descent, group, composed, of, three, or, more, clans, each, of, whose, apical, ancestors, are, descended, from, a, further, common, ancestor, if, a, society, is, divided, into, exactly, two, descent, groups, each, is, called, a, moiety, after, the, french, word, for, half, if, the, two, halves, are, each, obliged, to, marry, out, and, into, the, other, these, are, called, matrimonial, moieties, houseman, and, white, 1998b, bibliography, have, discovered, numerous, societies, where, kinship, network, analysis, shows, that, two, halves, marry, one, another, similar, to, matrimonial, moieties, except, that, the, two, halves, which, they, call, matrimonial, sides, are, neither, named, nor, descent, groups, although, the, egocentric, kinship, terms, may, be, consistent, with, the, pattern, of, sidedness, whereas, the, sidedness, is, culturally, evident, but, imperfect, the, word, deme, refers, to, an, endogamous, local, population, that, does, not, have, unilineal, descent, thus, a, deme, is, a, local, endogamous, community, without, internal, segmentation, into, clans, in, some, societies, kinship, and, political, relations, are, organized, around, membership, in, corporately, organized, dwellings, rather, than, around, descent, groups, or, lineages, as, in, the, house, of, windsor, the, concept, of, a, house, society, was, originally, proposed, by, claude, l, vi, strauss, who, called, them, soci, t, s, maison, the, concept, has, been, applied, to, understand, the, organization, of, societies, from, mesoamerica, and, the, moluccas, to, north, africa, and, medieval, europe, l, vi, strauss, introduced, the, concept, as, an, alternative, to, corporate, kinship, group, among, the, cognatic, kinship, groups, of, the, pacific, region, the, socially, significant, groupings, within, these, societies, have, variable, membership, because, kinship, is, reckoned, bilaterally, through, both, father, s, and, mother, s, kin, and, comes, together, for, only, short, periods, property, genealogy, and, residence, are, not, the, basis, for, the, group, s, existence, marriage, is, a, socially, or, ritually, recognized, union, or, legal, contract, between, spouses, that, establishes, rights, and, obligations, between, them, between, them, and, their, children, and, between, them, and, their, in, laws, the, definition, of, marriage, varies, according, to, different, cultures, but, it, is, principally, an, institution, in, which, interpersonal, relationships, usually, intimate, and, sexual, are, acknowledged, when, defined, broadly, marriage, is, considered, a, cultural, universal, a, broad, definition, of, marriage, includes, those, that, are, monogamous, polygamous, same, sex, and, temporary, the, act, of, marriage, usually, creates, normative, or, legal, obligations, between, the, individuals, involved, and, any, offspring, they, may, produce, marriage, may, result, for, example, in, a, union, between, a, man, and, a, woman, such, that, children, born, to, the, woman, are, the, recognized, legitimate, offspring, of, both, partners, edmund, leach, argued, that, no, one, definition, of, marriage, applied, to, all, cultures, but, offered, a, list, of, ten, rights, frequently, associated, with, marriage, including, sexual, monopoly, and, rights, with, respect, to, children, with, specific, rights, differing, across, cultures, there, is, wide, cross, cultural, variation, in, the, social, rules, governing, the, selection, of, a, partner, for, marriage, in, many, societies, the, choice, of, partner, is, limited, to, suitable, persons, from, specific, social, groups, in, some, societies, the, rule, is, that, a, partner, is, selected, from, an, individual, s, own, social, group, endogamy, this, is, the, case, in, many, class, and, caste, based, societies, but, in, other, societies, a, partner, must, be, chosen, from, a, different, group, than, one, s, own, exogamy, this, is, the, case, in, many, societies, practicing, totemic, religion, where, society, is, divided, into, several, exogamous, totemic, clans, such, as, most, aboriginal, australian, societies, marriages, between, parents, and, children, or, between, full, siblings, with, few, exceptions, have, been, considered, incest, and, forbidden, however, marriages, between, more, distant, relatives, have, been, much, more, common, with, one, estimate, being, that, 80, of, all, marriages, in, history, have, been, between, second, cousins, or, closer, systemic, forms, of, preferential, marriage, may, have, wider, social, implications, in, terms, of, economic, and, political, organization, in, a, wide, array, of, lineage, based, societies, with, a, classificatory, kinship, system, potential, spouses, are, sought, from, a, specific, class, of, relatives, as, determined, by, a, prescriptive, marriage, rule, insofar, as, regular, marriages, following, prescriptive, rules, occur, lineages, are, linked, together, in, fixed, relationships, these, ties, between, lineages, may, form, political, alliances, in, kinship, dominated, societies, french, structural, anthropologist, claude, l, vi, strauss, developed, the, alliance, theory, to, account, for, the, elementary, kinship, structures, created, by, the, limited, number, of, prescriptive, marriage, rules, possible, claude, l, vi, strauss, argued, in, the, elementary, structures, of, kinship, 1949, that, the, incest, taboo, necessitated, the, exchange, of, women, between, kinship, groups, levi, strauss, thus, shifted, the, emphasis, from, descent, groups, to, the, stable, structures, or, relations, between, groups, that, preferential, and, prescriptive, marriage, rules, created, one, of, the, foundational, works, in, the, anthropological, study, of, kinship, was, morgan, s, systems, of, consanguinity, and, affinity, of, the, human, family, 1871, as, is, the, case, with, other, social, sciences, anthropology, and, kinship, studies, emerged, at, a, time, when, the, understanding, of, the, human, species, comparative, place, in, the, world, was, somewhat, different, from, today, s, evidence, that, life, in, stable, social, groups, is, not, just, a, feature, of, humans, but, also, of, many, other, primates, was, yet, to, emerge, and, society, was, considered, to, be, a, uniquely, human, affair, as, a, result, early, kinship, theorists, saw, an, apparent, need, to, explain, not, only, the, details, of, how, human, social, groups, are, constructed, their, patterns, meanings, and, obligations, but, also, why, they, are, constructed, at, all, the, why, explanations, thus, typically, presented, the, fact, of, life, in, social, groups, which, appeared, to, be, unique, to, humans, as, being, largely, a, result, of, human, ideas, and, values, morgan, s, explanation, for, why, humans, live, in, groups, was, largely, based, on, the, notion, that, all, humans, have, an, inherent, natural, valuation, of, genealogical, ties, an, unexamined, assumption, that, would, remain, at, the, heart, of, kinship, studies, for, another, century, see, below, and, therefore, also, an, inherent, desire, to, construct, social, groups, around, these, ties, even, so, morgan, found, that, members, of, a, society, who, are, not, close, genealogical, relatives, may, nevertheless, use, what, he, called, kinship, terms, which, he, considered, to, be, originally, based, on, genealogical, ties, this, fact, was, already, evident, in, his, use, of, the, term, affinity, within, his, concept, of, the, system, of, kinship, the, most, lasting, of, morgan, s, contributions, was, his, discovery, of, the, difference, between, descriptive, and, classificatory, kinship, terms, which, situated, broad, kinship, classes, on, the, basis, of, imputing, abstract, social, patterns, of, relationships, having, little, or, no, overall, relation, to, genetic, closeness, but, instead, cognition, about, kinship, social, distinctions, as, they, affect, linguistic, usages, in, kinship, terminology, and, strongly, relate, if, only, by, approximation, to, patterns, of, marriage, a, more, flexible, view, of, kinship, was, formulated, in, british, social, anthropology, among, the, attempts, to, break, out, of, universalizing, assumptions, and, theories, about, kinship, radcliffe, brown, 1922, the, andaman, islands, 1930, the, social, organization, of, australian, tribes, was, the, first, to, assert, that, kinship, relations, are, best, thought, of, as, concrete, networks, of, relationships, among, individuals, he, then, described, these, relationships, however, as, typified, by, interlocking, interpersonal, roles, malinowski, 1922, argonauts, of, the, western, pacific, described, patterns, of, events, with, concrete, individuals, as, participants, stressing, the, relative, stability, of, institutions, and, communities, but, without, insisting, on, abstract, systems, or, models, of, kinship, gluckman, 1955, the, judicial, process, among, the, barotse, of, northern, rhodesia, balanced, the, emphasis, on, stability, of, institutions, against, processes, of, change, and, conflict, inferred, through, detailed, analysis, of, instances, of, social, interaction, to, infer, rules, and, assumptions, john, barnes, victor, turner, and, others, affiliated, with, gluckman, s, manchester, school, of, anthropology, described, patterns, of, actual, network, relations, in, communities, and, fluid, situations, in, urban, or, migratory, context, as, with, the, work, of, j, clyde, mitchell, 1965, social, networks, in, urban, situations, yet, all, these, approaches, clung, to, a, view, of, stable, functionalism, with, kinship, as, one, of, the, central, stable, institutions, more, recently, under, the, influence, of, new, kinship, studies, there, has, been, a, shift, of, emphasis, from, the, being, to, the, doing, of, kinship, a, new, generation, of, anthropologist, study, the, processes, of, doing, kinship, in, new, contexts, such, as, in, migrant, communities, and, in, queer, families, the, concept, of, system, of, kinship, tended, to, dominate, anthropological, studies, of, kinship, in, the, early, 20th, century, kinship, systems, as, defined, in, anthropological, texts, and, ethnographies, were, seen, as, constituted, by, patterns, of, behavior, and, attitudes, in, relation, to, the, differences, in, terminology, listed, above, for, referring, to, relationships, as, well, as, for, addressing, others, many, anthropologists, went, so, far, as, to, see, in, these, patterns, of, kinship, strong, relations, between, kinship, categories, and, patterns, of, marriage, including, forms, of, marriage, restrictions, on, marriage, and, cultural, concepts, of, the, boundaries, of, incest, a, great, deal, of, inference, was, necessarily, involved, in, such, constructions, as, to, systems, of, kinship, and, attempts, to, construct, systemic, patterns, and, reconstruct, kinship, evolutionary, histories, on, these, bases, were, largely, invalidated, in, later, work, however, anthropologist, dwight, read, later, argued, that, the, way, in, which, kinship, categories, are, defined, by, individual, researchers, are, substantially, inconsistent, this, not, only, occurs, when, working, within, a, systemic, cultural, model, that, can, be, elicited, in, fieldwork, but, also, when, allowing, considerable, individual, variability, in, details, such, as, when, they, are, recorded, through, relative, products, in, trying, to, resolve, the, problems, of, dubious, inferences, about, kinship, systems, george, p, murdock, 1949, social, structure, compiled, kinship, data, to, test, a, theory, about, universals, in, human, kinship, in, the, way, that, terminologies, were, influenced, by, the, behavioral, similarities, or, social, differences, among, pairs, of, kin, proceeding, on, the, view, that, the, psychological, ordering, of, kinship, systems, radiates, out, from, ego, and, the, nuclear, family, to, different, forms, of, extended, family, l, vi, strauss, 1949, les, structures, elementaires, on, the, other, hand, also, looked, for, global, patterns, to, kinship, but, viewed, the, elementary, forms, of, kinship, as, lying, in, the, ways, that, families, were, connected, by, marriage, in, different, fundamental, forms, resembling, those, of, modes, of, exchange, symmetric, and, direct, reciprocal, delay, or, generalized, exchange, building, on, l, vi, strauss, s, 1949, notions, of, kinship, as, caught, up, with, the, fluid, languages, of, exchange, edmund, leach, 1961, pul, eliya, argued, that, kinship, was, a, flexible, idiom, that, had, something, of, the, grammar, of, a, language, both, in, the, uses, of, terms, for, kin, but, also, in, the, fluidities, of, language, meaning, and, networks, his, field, studies, criticized, the, ideas, of, structural, functional, stability, of, kinship, groups, as, corporations, with, charters, that, lasted, long, beyond, the, lifetimes, of, individuals, which, had, been, the, orthodoxy, of, british, social, anthropology, this, sparked, debates, over, whether, kinship, could, be, resolved, into, specific, organized, sets, of, rules, and, components, of, meaning, or, whether, kinship, meanings, were, more, fluid, symbolic, and, independent, of, grounding, in, supposedly, determinate, relations, among, individuals, or, groups, such, as, those, of, descent, or, prescriptions, for, marriage, from, the, 1950s, onwards, reports, on, kinship, patterns, in, the, new, guinea, highlands, added, some, momentum, to, what, had, until, then, been, only, occasional, fleeting, suggestions, that, living, together, co, residence, might, underlie, social, bonding, and, eventually, contributed, to, the, general, shift, away, from, a, genealogical, approach, see, below, section, for, example, on, the, basis, of, his, observations, barnes, suggested, learly, genealogical, connexion, of, some, sort, is, one, criterion, for, membership, of, many, social, groups, but, it, may, not, be, the, only, criterion, birth, or, residence, or, a, parent, s, former, residence, or, utilization, of, garden, land, or, participation, in, exchange, and, feasting, activities, or, in, house, building, or, raiding, may, be, other, relevant, criteria, for, group, membership, barnes, 1962, 6, similarly, langness, ethnography, of, the, bena, bena, also, emphasized, the, primacy, of, residence, patterns, in, creating, kinship, ties, the, sheer, fact, of, residence, in, a, bena, bena, group, can, and, does, determine, kinship, people, do, not, necessarily, reside, where, they, do, because, they, are, kinsmen, rather, they, become, kinsmen, because, they, reside, there, langness, 1964, 172, emphasis, in, original, in, 1972, david, m, schneider, raised, deep, problems, with, the, notion, that, human, social, bonds, and, kinship, was, a, natural, category, built, upon, genealogical, ties, and, made, a, fuller, argument, in, his, 1984, book, a, critique, of, the, study, of, kinship, which, had, a, major, influence, on, the, subsequent, study, of, kinship, before, the, questions, raised, within, anthropology, about, the, study, of, kinship, by, david, m, schneider, and, others, from, the, 1960s, onwards, anthropology, itself, had, paid, very, little, attention, to, the, notion, that, kinship, bonds, were, anything, other, than, connected, to, consanguineal, or, genealogical, relatedness, or, its, local, cultural, conceptions, schneider, s, 1968, study, of, the, symbolic, meanings, surrounding, ideas, of, kinship, in, american, culture, found, that, americans, ascribe, a, special, significance, to, blood, ties, as, well, as, related, symbols, like, the, naturalness, of, marriage, and, raising, children, within, this, culture, in, later, work, 1972, and, 1984, schneider, argued, that, unexamined, genealogical, notions, of, kinship, had, been, embedded, in, anthropology, since, morgan, s, early, work, because, american, anthropologists, and, anthropologists, in, western, europe, had, made, the, mistake, of, assuming, these, particular, cultural, values, of, blood, is, thicker, than, water, common, in, their, own, societies, were, natural, and, universal, for, all, human, cultures, i, e, a, form, of, ethnocentrism, he, concluded, that, due, to, these, unexamined, assumptions, the, whole, enterprise, of, kinship, in, anthropology, may, have, been, built, on, faulty, foundations, his, 1984, book, a, critique, of, the, study, of, kinship, gave, his, fullest, account, of, this, critique, certainly, for, morgan, 1870, 10, the, actual, bonds, of, blood, relationship, had, a, force, and, vitality, of, their, own, quite, apart, from, any, social, overlay, which, they, may, also, have, acquired, and, it, is, this, biological, relationship, itself, which, accounts, for, what, radcliffe, brown, called, the, source, of, social, cohesion, schneider, 1984, 49, schneider, himself, emphasised, a, distinction, between, the, notion, of, a, social, relationship, as, intrinsically, given, and, inalienable, from, birth, and, a, social, relationship, as, created, constituted, and, maintained, by, a, process, of, interaction, or, doing, schneider, 1984, 165, schneider, used, the, example, of, the, citamangen, fak, relationship, in, yap, society, that, his, own, early, research, had, previously, glossed, over, as, a, father, son, relationship, to, illustrate, the, problem, the, crucial, point, is, this, in, the, relationship, between, citamangen, and, fak, the, stress, in, the, definition, of, the, relationship, is, more, on, doing, than, on, being, that, is, it, is, more, what, the, citamangen, does, for, fak, and, what, fak, does, for, citamangen, that, makes, or, constitutes, the, relationship, this, is, demonstrated, first, in, the, ability, to, terminate, absolutely, the, relationship, where, there, is, a, failure, in, the, doing, when, the, fak, fails, to, do, what, he, is, supposed, to, do, and, second, in, the, reversal, of, terms, so, that, the, old, dependent, man, becomes, fak, to, the, young, man, tam, the, european, and, the, anthropological, notion, of, consanguinity, of, blood, relationship, and, descent, rest, on, precisely, the, opposite, kind, of, value, it, rests, more, on, the, state, of, being, on, the, biogenetic, relationship, which, is, represented, by, one, or, another, variant, of, the, symbol, of, blood, consanguinity, or, on, birth, on, qualities, rather, than, on, performance, we, have, tried, to, impose, this, definition, of, a, kind, of, relation, on, all, peoples, insisting, that, kinship, consists, in, relations, of, consanguinity, and, that, kinship, as, consanguinity, is, a, universal, condition, schneider, 1984, 72, schneider, preferred, to, focus, on, these, often, ignored, processes, of, performance, forms, of, doing, various, codes, for, conduct, different, roles, p, 72, as, the, most, important, constituents, of, kinship, his, critique, quickly, prompted, a, new, generation, of, anthropologists, to, reconsider, how, they, conceptualized, observed, and, described, social, relationships, kinship, in, the, cultures, they, studied, schneider, s, critique, is, widely, acknowledged, to, have, marked, a, turning, point, in, anthropology, s, study, of, social, relationships, and, interactions, some, anthropologists, moved, forward, with, kinship, studies, by, teasing, apart, biological, and, social, aspects, prompted, by, schneider, s, question, the, question, of, whether, kinship, is, a, privileged, system, and, if, so, why, remains, without, a, satisfactory, answer, if, it, is, privileged, because, of, its, relationship, to, the, functional, prerequisites, imposed, by, the, nature, of, physical, kinship, this, remains, to, be, spelled, out, in, even, the, most, elementary, detail, schneider, 1984, 163, schneider, also, dismissed, the, sociobiological, account, of, biological, influences, maintaining, that, these, did, not, fit, the, ethnographic, evidence, see, more, below, janet, carsten, employed, her, studies, with, the, malays, to, reassess, kinship, she, uses, the, idea, of, relatedness, to, move, away, from, a, pre, constructed, analytic, opposition, between, the, biological, and, the, social, carsten, argued, that, relatedness, should, be, described, in, terms, of, indigenous, statements, and, practices, some, of, which, fall, outside, what, anthropologists, have, conventionally, understood, as, kinship, ideas, about, relatedness, in, langkawi, show, how, culturally, specific, is, the, separation, of, the, social, from, the, biological, and, the, latter, to, sexual, reproduction, in, langkawi, relatedness, is, derived, both, from, acts, of, procreation, and, from, living, and, eating, together, it, makes, little, sense, in, indigenous, terms, to, label, some, of, these, activities, as, social, and, others, as, biological, carsten, 1995, 236, philip, thomas, work, with, the, temanambondro, of, madagascar, highlights, that, nurturing, processes, are, considered, to, be, the, basis, for, kinship, ties, in, this, culture, notwithstanding, genealogical, connections, yet, just, as, fathers, are, not, simply, made, by, birth, neither, are, mothers, and, although, mothers, are, not, made, by, custom, they, like, fathers, can, make, themselves, through, another, type, of, performatively, constituted, relation, the, giving, of, nurture, relations, of, ancestry, are, particularly, important, in, contexts, of, ritual, inheritance, and, the, defining, of, marriageability, and, incest, they, are, in, effect, the, structuring, structures, bourdieu, 1977, of, social, reproduction, and, intergenerational, continuity, father, mother, and, children, are, however, also, performatively, related, through, the, giving, and, receiving, of, nurture, fitezana, like, ancestry, relations, of, nurture, do, not, always, coincide, with, relations, by, birth, but, unlike, ancestry, nurture, is, a, largely, ungendered, relation, constituted, in, contexts, of, everyday, practical, existence, in, the, intimate, familial, and, familiar, world, of, the, household, and, in, ongoing, relations, of, work, and, consumption, of, feeding, and, farming, thomas, 1999, 37, similar, ethnographic, accounts, have, emerged, from, a, variety, of, cultures, since, schneider, s, intervention, the, concept, of, nurture, kinship, highlights, the, extent, to, which, kinship, relationships, may, be, brought, into, being, through, the, performance, of, various, acts, of, nurture, between, individuals, additionally, the, concept, highlights, ethnographic, findings, that, in, a, wide, swath, of, human, societies, people, understand, conceptualize, and, symbolize, their, relationships, predominantly, in, terms, of, giving, receiving, and, sharing, nurture, these, approaches, were, somewhat, forerun, by, malinowski, in, his, ethnographic, study, of, sexual, behaviour, on, the, trobriand, islands, which, noted, that, the, trobrianders, did, not, believe, pregnancy, to, be, the, result, of, sexual, intercourse, between, the, man, and, the, woman, and, they, denied, that, there, was, any, physiological, relationship, between, father, and, child, nevertheless, while, paternity, was, unknown, in, the, full, biological, sense, for, a, woman, to, have, a, child, without, having, a, husband, was, considered, socially, undesirable, fatherhood, was, therefore, recognised, as, a, social, and, nurturing, role, the, woman, s, husband, is, the, man, whose, role, and, duty, it, is, to, take, the, child, in, his, arms, and, to, help, her, in, nursing, and, bringing, it, up, thus, though, the, natives, are, ignorant, of, any, physiological, need, for, a, male, in, the, constitution, of, the, family, they, regard, him, as, indispensable, socially, like, schneider, other, anthropologists, of, kinship, have, largely, rejected, sociobiological, accounts, of, human, social, patterns, as, being, both, reductionistic, and, also, empirically, incompatible, with, ethnographic, data, on, human, kinship, notably, marshall, sahlins, strongly, critiqued, the, sociobiological, approach, through, reviews, of, ethnographies, in, his, 1976, the, use, and, abuse, of, biology, noting, that, for, humans, the, categories, of, near, and, distant, vary, independently, of, consanguinal, distance, and, that, these, categories, organize, actual, social, practice, p, 112, independently, from, anthropology, biologists, studying, organisms, social, behaviours, and, relationships, have, been, interested, to, understand, under, what, conditions, significant, social, behaviors, can, evolve, to, become, a, typical, feature, of, a, species, see, inclusive, fitness, theory, because, complex, social, relationships, and, cohesive, social, groups, are, common, not, only, to, humans, but, also, to, most, primates, biologists, maintain, that, these, biological, theories, of, sociality, should, in, principle, be, generally, applicable, the, more, challenging, question, arises, as, to, how, such, ideas, can, be, applied, to, the, human, species, whilst, fully, taking, account, of, the, extensive, ethnographic, evidence, that, has, emerged, from, anthropological, research, on, kinship, patterns, early, developments, of, biological, inclusive, fitness, theory, and, the, derivative, field, of, sociobiology, encouraged, some, sociobiologists, and, evolutionary, psychologists, to, approach, human, kinship, with, the, assumption, that, inclusive, fitness, theory, predicts, that, kinship, relations, in, humans, are, indeed, expected, to, depend, on, genetic, relatedness, which, they, readily, connected, with, the, genealogy, approach, of, early, anthropologists, such, as, morgan, see, above, sections, however, this, is, the, position, that, schneider, sahlins, and, other, anthropologists, explicitly, reject, in, agreement, with, schneider, holland, argued, that, an, accurate, account, of, biological, theory, and, evidence, supports, the, view, that, social, bonds, and, kinship, are, indeed, mediated, by, a, shared, social, environment, and, processes, of, frequent, interaction, care, and, nurture, rather, than, by, genealogical, relationships, per, se, even, if, genealogical, relationships, frequently, correlate, with, such, processes, in, his, 2012, book, social, bonding, and, nurture, kinship, holland, argues, that, sociobiologists, and, later, evolutionary, psychologists, misrepresent, biological, theory, mistakenly, believing, that, inclusive, fitness, theory, predicts, that, genetic, relatedness, per, se, is, the, condition, that, mediates, social, bonding, and, social, cooperation, in, organisms, holland, points, out, that, the, biological, theory, see, inclusive, fitness, only, specifies, that, a, statistical, relationship, between, social, behaviors, and, genealogical, relatedness, is, a, criterion, for, the, evolution, of, social, behaviors, the, theory, s, originator, w, d, hamilton, considered, that, organisms, social, behaviours, were, likely, to, be, mediated, by, general, conditions, that, typically, correlate, with, genetic, relatedness, but, are, not, likely, to, be, mediated, by, genetic, relatedness, per, se, see, human, inclusive, fitness, and, kin, recognition, holland, reviews, fieldwork, from, social, mammals, and, primates, to, show, that, social, bonding, and, cooperation, in, these, species, is, indeed, mediated, through, processes, of, shared, living, context, familiarity, and, attachments, not, by, genetic, relatedness, per, se, holland, thus, argues, that, both, the, biological, theory, and, the, biological, evidence, is, nondeterministic, and, nonreductive, and, that, biology, as, a, theoretical, and, empirical, endeavor, as, opposed, to, biology, as, a, cultural, symbolic, nexus, as, outlined, in, schneider, s, 1968, book, actually, supports, the, nurture, kinship, perspective, of, cultural, anthropologists, working, post, schneider, see, above, sections, holland, argues, that, whilst, there, is, nonreductive, compatibility, around, human, kinship, between, anthropology, biology, and, psychology, for, a, full, account, of, kinship, in, any, particular, human, culture, ethnographic, methods, including, accounts, of, the, people, themselves, the, analysis, of, historical, contingencies, symbolic, systems, economic, and, other, cultural, influences, remain, centrally, important, holland, s, position, is, widely, supported, by, both, cultural, anthropologists, and, biologists, as, an, approach, which, according, to, robin, fox, gets, to, the, heart, of, the, matter, concerning, the, contentious, relationship, between, kinship, categories, genetic, relatedness, and, the, prediction, of, behavior, the, other, approach, that, of, evolutionary, psychology, continues, to, take, the, view, that, genetic, relatedness, or, genealogy, is, key, to, understanding, human, kinship, patterns, in, contrast, to, sahlin, s, position, above, daly, and, wilson, argue, that, the, categories, of, near, and, distant, do, not, vary, independently, of, consanguinal, distance, not, in, any, society, on, earth, daly, et, al, 1997, p282, a, current, view, is, that, humans, have, an, inborn, but, culturally, affected, system, for, detecting, certain, forms, of, genetic, relatedness, one, important, factor, for, sibling, detection, especially, relevant, for, older, siblings, is, that, if, an, infant, and, one, s, mother, are, seen, to, care, for, the, infant, then, the, infant, and, oneself, are, assumed, to, be, related, another, factor, especially, important, for, younger, siblings, who, cannot, use, the, first, method, is, that, persons, who, grew, up, together, see, one, another, as, related, yet, another, may, be, genetic, detection, based, on, the, major, histocompatibility, complex, see, major, histocompatibility, complex, and, sexual, selection, this, kinship, detection, system, in, turn, affects, other, genetic, predispositions, such, as, the, incest, taboo, and, a, tendency, for, altruism, towards, relatives, one, issue, within, this, approach, is, why, many, societies, organize, according, to, descent, see, below, and, not, exclusively, according, to, kinship, an, explanation, is, that, kinship, does, not, form, clear, boundaries, and, is, centered, differently, for, each, individual, in, contrast, descent, groups, usually, do, form, clear, boundaries, and, provide, an, easy, way, to, create, cooperative, groups, of, various, sizes, according, to, an, evolutionary, psychology, hypothesis, that, assumes, that, descent, systems, are, optimized, to, assure, high, genetic, probability, of, relatedness, between, lineage, members, males, should, prefer, a, patrilineal, system, if, paternal, certainty, is, high, males, should, prefer, a, matrilineal, system, if, paternal, certainty, is, low, some, research, supports, this, association, with, one, study, finding, no, patrilineal, society, with, low, paternity, confidence, and, no, matrilineal, society, with, high, paternal, certainty, another, association, is, that, pastoral, societies, are, relatively, more, often, patrilineal, compared, to, horticultural, societies, this, may, be, because, wealth, in, pastoral, societies, in, the, form, of, mobile, cattle, can, easily, be, used, to, pay, bride, price, which, favor, concentrating, resources, on, sons, so, they, can, marry, the, evolutionary, psychology, account, of, biology, continues, to, be, rejected, by, most, cultural, anthropologists, as, social, and, biological, concepts, of, parenthood, are, not, necessarily, coterminous, the, terms, pater, and, genitor, have, been, used, in, anthropology, to, distinguish, between, the, man, who, is, socially, recognised, as, father, pater, and, the, man, who, is, believed, to, be, the, physiological, parent, genitor, similarly, the, terms, mater, and, genitrix, have, been, used, to, distinguish, between, the, woman, socially, recognised, as, mother, mater, and, the, woman, believed, to, be, the, physiological, parent, genitrix, such, a, distinction, is, useful, when, the, individual, who, is, considered, the, legal, parent, of, the, child, is, not, the, individual, who, is, believed, to, be, the, child, s, biological, parent, for, example, in, his, ethnography, of, the, nuer, evans, pritchard, notes, that, if, a, widow, following, the, death, of, her, husband, chooses, to, live, with, a, lover, outside, of, her, deceased, husband, s, kin, group, that, lover, is, only, considered, genitor, of, any, subsequent, children, the, widow, has, and, her, deceased, husband, continues, to, be, considered, the, pater, as, a, result, the, lover, has, no, legal, control, over, the, children, who, may, be, taken, away, from, him, by, the, kin, of, the, pater, when, they, choose, the, terms, pater, and, genitor, have, also, been, used, to, help, describe, the, relationship, between, children, and, their, parents, in, the, context, of, divorce, in, britain, following, the, divorce, and, remarriage, of, their, parents, children, find, themselves, using, the, term, mother, or, father, in, relation, to, more, than, one, individual, and, the, pater, or, mater, who, is, legally, responsible, for, the, child, s, care, and, whose, family, name, the, child, uses, may, not, be, the, genitor, or, genitrix, of, the, child, with, whom, a, separate, parent, child, relationship, may, be, maintained, through, arrangements, such, as, visitation, rights, or, joint, custody, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, terms, genitor, or, genetrix, do, not, necessarily, imply, actual, biological, relationships, based, on, consanguinity, but, rather, refer, to, the, socially, held, belief, that, the, individual, is, physically, related, to, the, child, derived, from, culturally, held, ideas, about, how, biology, works, so, for, example, the, ifugao, may, believe, that, an, illegitimate, child, might, have, more, than, one, physical, father, and, so, nominate, more, than, one, genitor, j, a, barnes, therefore, argued, that, it, was, necessary, to, make, a, further, distinction, between, genitor, and, genitrix, the, supposed, biological, mother, and, father, of, the, child, and, the, actual, genetic, father, and, mother, of, the, child, making, them, share, their, genes, or, genetics, the, study, of, kinship, may, be, abstracted, to, binary, relations, between, people, for, example, if, x, is, the, parent, of, y, the, relation, may, be, symbolized, as, xpy, the, converse, relation, that, y, is, the, child, of, x, is, written, yp, t, x, suppose, that, z, is, another, child, of, x, zp, t, x, then, y, is, a, sibling, of, z, as, they, share, the, parent, x, zp, t, xpy, zp, t, py, here, the, relation, of, siblings, is, expressed, as, the, composition, p, t, p, of, the, parent, relation, with, its, inverse, the, relation, of, grandparent, is, the, composition, of, the, parent, relation, with, itself, g, pp, an, uncle, or, aunt, is, the, sibling, of, a, parent, p, t, p, p, which, can, also, be, interpreted, as, the, child, of, a, grandparent, p, t, pp, suppose, x, is, the, grandparent, of, y, xgy, then, y, and, z, are, cousins, if, yg, t, xgz, the, symbols, applied, here, to, express, kinship, are, used, more, generally, in, algebraic, logic, to, develop, a, calculus, of, relations, with, sets, other, than, human, beings
