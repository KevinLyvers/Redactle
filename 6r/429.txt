right, a, large, proportion, of, professional, racing, drivers, began, in, karts, often, from, a, very, young, age, such, as, michael, schumacher, and, fernando, alonso, several, former, motorcycle, champions, have, also, taken, up, the, sport, notably, wayne, rainey, who, was, paralysed, in, a, racing, accident, and, now, races, a, hand, controlled, kart, as, one, of, the, cheapest, ways, to, race, karting, is, seeing, its, popularity, grow, worldwide, despite, their, diminutive, size, karts, of, the, most, powerful, class, superkart, assuming, a, weight, of, 205, kg, 452, lb, and, a, power, output, of, 100, hp, 75, kw, can, have, a, power, to, weight, ratio, including, the, driver, of, 490, hp, tonne, 0, 22, hp, lb, without, the, driver, this, figure, doubles, to, almost, 980, hp, tonne, 0, 44, hp, lb, historic, motorsport, or, vintage, motorsport, uses, vehicles, limited, to, a, particular, era, only, safety, precautions, are, modernized, in, these, hobbyist, races, a, historical, event, can, be, of, various, types, of, motorsport, disciplines, from, road, racing, to, rallying, because, it, is, based, on, a, particular, era, it, is, more, hobbyist, oriented, reducing, corporate, sponsorship, the, only, modern, equipment, used, is, related, to, safety, and, timing, a, historical, event, can, be, of, a, number, of, different, motorsport, disciplines, some, of, the, most, famous, events, include, the, goodwood, festival, of, speed, and, goodwood, revival, in, britain, and, monterey, historic, in, the, united, states, championships, range, from, grass, root, austin, seven, racing, to, the, fia, thoroughbred, grand, prix, championship, for, classic, formula, one, chassis, while, there, are, several, professional, teams, and, drivers, in, historical, racing, this, branch, of, auto, sport, tends, to, be, contested, by, wealthy, car, owners, and, is, thus, more, amateur, and, less, competitive, in, its, approach, in, many, types, of, auto, races, particularly, those, held, on, closed, courses, flags, are, displayed, to, indicate, the, general, status, of, the, track, and, to, communicate, instructions, to, competitors, while, individual, series, have, different, rules, and, the, flags, have, changed, from, the, first, years, e, g, red, used, to, start, a, race, these, are, generally, accepted, the, worst, accident, in, racing, history, is, the, 1955, le, mans, disaster, where, more, than, 80, people, died, including, the, french, driver, pierre, levegh, in, auto, racing, the, racing, setup, or, car, setup, is, the, set, of, adjustments, made, to, the, vehicle, to, optimize, its, behaviour, performance, handling, reliability, etc, adjustments, can, occur, in, suspensions, brakes, transmissions, engines, tires, and, many, others, aerodynamics, and, airflow, play, big, roles, in, the, setup, of, a, race, car, aerodynamic, downforce, improves, the, race, car, s, handling, by, lowering, the, center, of, gravity, and, distributing, the, weight, of, the, car, equally, on, each, tire, once, this, is, achieved, fuel, consumption, decreases, and, the, forces, against, the, car, are, significantly, lowered, many, aerodynamic, experiments, are, conducted, in, wind, tunnels, to, simulate, real, life, situations, while, measuring, the, various, drag, forces, on, the, car, these, rolling, roads, produce, many, wind, situations, and, direct, air, flow, at, certain, speeds, and, angles, when, a, diffuser, is, installed, under, the, car, the, amount, of, drag, force, is, significantly, lowered, and, the, overall, aerodynamics, of, the, vehicle, is, positively, adjusted, wings, and, canards, channel, the, airflow, in, the, most, efficient, way, to, get, the, least, amount, of, drag, from, the, car, it, is, experimentally, proven, that, downforce, is, gained, and, the, vehicle, s, handling, is, considerably, changed, when, aerodynamic, wings, on, the, front, and, rear, of, the, vehicle, are, installed, suspension, plays, a, huge, part, in, giving, the, race, car, the, ability, to, be, driven, optimally, shocks, are, mounted, vertically, or, horizontally, to, prevent, the, body, from, rolling, in, the, corners, the, suspension, is, important, because, it, makes, the, car, stable, and, easier, to, control, and, keeps, the, tires, on, the, road, when, driving, on, uneven, terrain, it, works, in, three, different, ways, including, vertically, longitudinally, and, laterally, to, control, movement, when, racing, on, various, tracks, tyres, called, r, compounds, are, commonly, used, in, motorsports, for, high, amounts, of, traction, the, soft, rubber, allows, them, to, expand, when, they, are, heated, up, making, more, surface, area, on, the, pavement, therefore, producing, the, most, traction, these, types, of, tyres, do, not, have, grooves, on, them, tyre, pressure, is, dependent, on, the, temperature, of, the, tyre, and, track, when, racing, each, time, a, driver, pulls, into, the, pits, the, tyre, pressure, and, temperature, should, be, tested, for, optimal, performance, when, the, tyres, get, too, hot, they, will, swell, or, inflate, and, need, to, be, deflated, to, the, correct, pressure, when, the, tyres, are, not, warmed, up, they, will, not, perform, as, well, brakes, on, a, race, car, are, imperative, in, slowing, and, stopping, the, car, at, precise, times, and, wear, quickly, depending, on, the, road, or, track, on, which, the, car, is, being, raced, how, many, laps, are, being, run, track, conditions, due, to, weather, and, how, many, caution, runs, require, more, braking, there, are, three, variables, to, consider, in, racing, brake, pedal, displacement, brake, pedal, force, and, vehicle, deceleration, various, combinations, of, these, variables, work, together, to, determine, the, stiffness, sensitivity, and, pedal, force, of, the, brakes, when, using, the, brakes, effectively, the, driver, must, go, through, a, buildup, phase, and, end, with, a, modulating, phase, these, phases, include, attaining, maximum, deceleration, and, modulating, the, brake, pressure, brake, performance, is, measured, in, bite, and, consistency, bite, happens, when, the, driver, first, applies, the, brakes, and, they, have, not, warmed, up, to, the, correct, temperature, to, operate, efficiently, consistency, is, measured, in, how, consistent, the, friction, is, during, the, entire, time, of, braking, these, two, measurements, determine, the, wear, of, the, brakes, the, race, car, s, engine, needs, a, considerable, amount, of, air, to, produce, maximum, power, the, air, intake, manifold, sucks, the, air, from, scoops, on, the, hood, and, front, bumper, and, feeds, it, into, the, engine, many, engine, modifications, to, increase, horsepower, and, efficiency, are, commonly, used, in, many, racing, sanctioning, bodies, engines, are, tuned, on, a, machine, called, a, dynamometer, which, is, commonly, known, in, the, racing, world, as, a, dyno, the, car, is, driven, onto, the, dyno, and, many, gauges, and, sensors, are, hooked, up, to, the, car, that, are, controlled, by, an, online, program, to, test, force, torque, or, power, through, the, testing, the, car, s, engine, maps, can, be, changed, to, get, the, most, horsepower, and, ultimately, speed, out, of, the, vehicle, racing, drivers, at, the, highest, levels, are, usually, paid, by, the, team, or, by, sponsors, and, can, command, very, substantial, salaries, contrary, to, what, may, be, popularly, assumed, racing, drivers, as, a, group, do, not, have, unusually, better, reflexes, or, peripheral, response, time, during, repeated, physiological, and, psychological, evaluations, of, professional, racing, drivers, the, two, characteristics, that, stand, out, are, racers, near, obsessive, need, to, control, their, surroundings, the, psychological, aspect, and, an, unusual, ability, to, process, fast, moving, information, physiological, in, this, researchers, have, noted, a, strong, correlation, between, racers, psychological, profiles, and, those, of, fighter, pilots, in, tests, comparing, racers, to, members, of, the, general, public, the, greater, the, complexity, of, the, information, processing, matrix, the, greater, the, speed, gap, between, racers, and, the, public, due, partly, to, the, performance, capabilities, of, modern, racing, cars, racing, drivers, require, a, high, level, of, fitness, focus, and, the, ability, to, concentrate, at, high, levels, for, long, periods, in, an, inherently, difficult, environment, racing, drivers, mainly, complain, about, pains, in, the, lumbar, shoulder, and, neck, regions, racing, drivers, experience, extremely, large, g, forces, because, formula, cars, and, sports, prototypes, generate, more, downforce, and, are, able, to, corner, at, significantly, higher, speeds, formula, 1, drivers, routinely, experience, g, loadings, in, excess, of, 4, 5, g
