customers, a, slot, machine, s, standard, layout, features, a, screen, displaying, three, or, more, reels, that, spin, when, the, game, is, activated, some, modern, slot, machines, still, include, a, lever, as, a, skeuomorphic, design, trait, to, trigger, play, however, the, mechanical, operations, of, early, machines, have, been, superseded, by, random, number, generators, and, most, are, now, operated, using, buttons, and, touchscreens, slot, machines, include, one, or, more, currency, detectors, that, validate, the, form, of, payment, whether, coin, banknote, voucher, or, token, the,

about, 70, of, the, average, u, s, casino, s, income, digital, technology, has, resulted, in, variations, in, the, original, slot, machine, concept, as, the, player, is, essentially, playing, a, video, game, manufacturers, can, offer, more, interactive, elements, such, as, advanced, bonus, rounds, and, more, varied, video, graphics, the, slot, machine, term, derives, from, the, slots, on, the, machine, for, inserting, and, retrieving, coins, fruit, machine, comes, from, the, traditional, fruit, images, on, the, spinning, reels, such, as, lemons, and, cherries, slot, machines, are, also, known, pejoratively, as, one, armed, bandits, alluding, to, the, large, mechanical, levers, affixed, to, the, sides, of, early, mechanical, machines, and, to, the, games, ability, to, empty, players, pockets, and, wallets, as, thieves, would, sittman, and, pitt, of, brooklyn, new, york, developed, a, gambling, machine, in, 1891, that, was, a, precursor, to, the, modern, slot, machine, it, contained, five, drums, holding, a, total, of, 50, card, faces, and, was, based, on, poker, the, machine, proved, extremely, popular, and, soon, many, bars, in, the, city, had, one, or, more, of, them, players, would, insert, a, nickel, and, pull, a, lever, which, would, spin, the, drums, and, the, cards, that, they, held, the, player, hoping, for, a, good, poker, hand, there, was, no, direct, payout, mechanism, so, a, pair, of, kings, might, get, the, player, a, free, beer, whereas, a, royal, flush, could, pay, out, cigars, or, drinks, the, prizes, were, wholly, dependent, upon, what, the, establishment, would, offer, to, improve, the, odds, for, the, house, two, cards, were, typically, removed, from, the, deck, the, ten, of, spades, and, the, jack, of, hearts, doubling, the, odds, against, winning, a, royal, flush, the, drums, could, also, be, rearranged, to, further, reduce, a, player, s, chance, of, winning, because, of, the, vast, number, of, possible, wins, in, the, original, poker, based, game, it, proved, practically, impossible, to, make, a, machine, capable, of, awarding, an, automatic, payout, for, all, possible, winning, combinations, at, some, time, between, 1887, and, 1895, charles, fey, of, san, francisco, california, devised, a, much, simpler, automatic, mechanism, with, three, spinning, reels, containing, a, total, of, five, symbols, horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and, a, liberty, bell, the, bell, gave, the, machine, its, name, by, replacing, ten, cards, with, five, symbols, and, using, three, reels, instead, of, five, drums, the, complexity, of, reading, a, win, was, considerably, reduced, allowing, fey, to, design, an, effective, automatic, payout, mechanism, three, bells, in, a, row, produced, the, biggest, payoff, ten, nickels, 50, liberty, bell, was, a, huge, success, and, spawned, a, thriving, mechanical, gaming, device, industry, after, a, few, years, the, devices, were, banned, in, california, but, fey, still, could, not, keep, up, with, the, demand, for, them, elsewhere, the, liberty, bell, machine, was, so, popular, that, it, was, copied, by, many, slot, machine, manufacturers, the, first, of, these, also, called, the, liberty, bell, was, produced, by, the, manufacturer, herbert, mills, in, 1907, by, 1908, bell, machines, had, been, installed, in, cigar, stores, brothels, and, barber, shops, early, machines, including, an, 1899, liberty, bell, are, now, part, of, the, nevada, state, museum, s, fey, collection, the, first, liberty, bell, machines, produced, by, mills, used, the, same, symbols, on, the, reels, as, did, charles, fey, s, original, soon, afterward, another, version, was, produced, with, patriotic, symbols, such, as, flags, and, wreaths, on, the, wheels, later, a, similar, machine, called, the, operator, s, bell, was, produced, that, included, the, option, of, adding, a, gum, vending, attachment, as, the, gum, offered, was, fruit, flavored, fruit, symbols, were, placed, on, the, reels, lemons, cherries, oranges, and, plums, a, bell, was, retained, and, a, picture, of, a, stick, of, bell, fruit, gum, the, origin, of, the, bar, symbol, was, also, present, this, set, of, symbols, proved, highly, popular, and, was, used, by, other, companies, that, began, to, make, their, own, slot, machines, caille, watling, jennings, and, pace, a, commonly, used, technique, to, avoid, gambling, laws, in, several, states, was, to, award, food, prizes, for, this, reason, several, gumball, and, other, vending, machines, were, regarded, with, mistrust, by, the, courts, the, two, iowa, cases, of, state, v, ellis, and, state, v, striggles, are, both, used, in, criminal, law, classes, to, illustrate, the, concept, of, reliance, upon, authority, as, it, relates, to, the, axiomatic, ignorantia, juris, non, excusat, ignorance, of, the, law, is, no, excuse, in, these, cases, a, mint, vending, machine, was, declared, to, be, a, gambling, device, because, the, machine, would, by, internally, manufactured, chance, occasionally, give, the, next, user, several, tokens, exchangeable, for, more, candy, despite, the, display, of, the, result, of, the, next, use, on, the, machine, the, courts, ruled, that, he, machine, appealed, to, the, player, s, propensity, to, gamble, and, that, is, vice, in, 1963, bally, developed, the, first, fully, electromechanical, slot, machine, called, money, honey, although, earlier, machines, such, as, bally, s, high, hand, draw, poker, machine, had, exhibited, the, basics, of, electromechanical, construction, as, early, as, 1940, its, electromechanical, workings, made, money, honey, the, first, slot, machine, with, a, bottomless, hopper, and, automatic, payout, of, up, to, 500, coins, without, the, help, of, an, attendant, the, popularity, of, this, machine, led, to, the, increasing, predominance, of, electronic, games, with, the, side, lever, soon, becoming, vestigial, the, first, video, slot, machine, was, developed, in, 1976, in, kearny, mesa, california, by, the, las, vegas, based, fortune, coin, co, this, machine, used, a, modified, 19, inch, 48, cm, sony, trinitron, color, receiver, for, the, display, and, logic, boards, for, all, slot, machine, functions, the, prototype, was, mounted, in, a, full, size, show, ready, slot, machine, cabinet, the, first, production, units, went, on, trial, at, the, las, vegas, hilton, hotel, after, some, modifications, to, defeat, cheating, attempts, the, video, slot, machine, was, approved, by, the, nevada, state, gaming, commission, and, eventually, found, popularity, on, the, las, vegas, strip, and, in, downtown, casinos, fortune, coin, co, and, its, video, slot, machine, technology, were, purchased, by, igt, international, gaming, technology, in, 1978, the, first, american, video, slot, machine, to, offer, a, second, screen, bonus, round, was, reel, em, in, developed, by, wms, industries, in, 1996, this, type, of, machine, had, appeared, in, australia, from, at, least, 1994, with, the, three, bags, full, game, with, this, type, of, machine, the, display, changes, to, provide, a, different, game, in, which, an, additional, payout, may, be, awarded, depending, on, the, machine, the, player, can, insert, cash, or, in, ticket, in, ticket, out, machines, a, paper, ticket, with, a, barcode, into, a, designated, slot, on, the, machine, the, machine, is, then, activated, by, means, of, a, lever, or, button, either, physical, or, on, a, touchscreen, which, activates, reels, that, spin, and, stop, to, rearrange, the, symbols, if, a, player, matches, a, winning, combination, of, symbols, the, player, earns, credits, based, on, the, paytable, symbols, vary, depending, on, the, theme, of, the, machine, classic, symbols, include, objects, such, as, fruits, bells, and, stylized, lucky, sevens, most, slot, games, have, a, theme, such, as, a, specific, style, location, or, character, symbols, and, other, bonus, features, of, the, game, are, typically, aligned, with, the, theme, some, themes, are, licensed, from, popular, media, franchises, including, films, television, series, including, game, shows, such, as, wheel, of, fortune, which, has, been, one, of, the, most, popular, lines, of, slot, machines, entertainers, and, musicians, multi, line, slot, machines, have, become, more, popular, since, the, 1990s, these, machines, have, more, than, one, payline, meaning, that, visible, symbols, that, are, not, aligned, on, the, main, horizontal, may, be, considered, as, winning, combinations, traditional, three, reel, slot, machines, commonly, have, one, three, or, five, paylines, while, video, slot, machines, may, have, 9, 15, 25, or, as, many, as, 1024, different, paylines, most, accept, variable, numbers, of, credits, to, play, with, 1, to, 15, credits, per, line, being, typical, the, higher, the, amount, bet, the, higher, the, payout, will, be, if, the, player, wins, one, of, the, main, differences, between, video, slot, machines, and, reel, machines, is, in, the, way, payouts, are, calculated, with, reel, machines, the, only, way, to, win, the, maximum, jackpot, is, to, play, the, maximum, number, of, coins, usually, three, sometimes, four, or, even, five, coins, per, spin, with, video, machines, the, fixed, payout, values, are, multiplied, by, the, number, of, coins, per, line, that, is, being, bet, in, other, words, on, a, reel, machine, the, odds, are, more, favorable, if, the, gambler, plays, with, the, maximum, number, of, coins, available, however, depending, on, the, structure, of, the, game, and, its, bonus, features, some, video, slots, may, still, include, features, that, improve, chances, at, payouts, by, making, increased, wagers, multi, way, games, eschew, fixed, paylines, in, favor, of, allowing, symbols, to, pay, anywhere, as, long, as, there, is, at, least, one, in, at, least, three, consecutive, reels, from, left, to, right, multi, way, games, may, be, configured, to, allow, players, to, bet, by, reel, for, example, on, a, game, with, a, 3x5, pattern, often, referred, to, as, a, 243, way, game, playing, one, reel, allows, all, three, symbols, in, the, first, reel, to, potentially, pay, but, only, the, center, row, pays, on, the, remaining, reels, often, designated, by, darkening, the, unused, portions, of, the, reels, other, multi, way, games, use, a, 4x5, or, 5x5, pattern, where, there, are, up, to, five, symbols, in, each, reel, allowing, for, up, to, 1, 024, and, 3, 125, ways, to, win, respectively, the, australian, manufacturer, aristocrat, leisure, brands, games, featuring, this, system, as, reel, power, xtra, reel, power, and, super, reel, power, respectively, a, variation, involves, patterns, where, symbols, are, adjacent, to, one, another, most, of, these, games, have, a, hexagonal, reel, formation, and, much, like, multi, way, games, any, patterns, not, played, are, darkened, out, of, use, denominations, can, range, from, 1, cent, penny, slots, all, the, way, up, to, 100, 00, or, more, per, credit, the, latter, are, typically, known, as, high, limit, machines, and, machines, configured, to, allow, for, such, wagers, are, often, located, in, dedicated, areas, which, may, have, a, separate, team, of, attendants, to, cater, to, the, needs, of, those, who, play, there, the, machine, automatically, calculates,

is, listed, on, the, face, of, the, machine, usually, above, and, below, the, area, containing, the, wheels, on, video, slot, machines, they, are, usually, contained, within, a, help, menu, along, with, information, on, other, features, historically, all, slot, machines, used, revolving, mechanical, reels, to, display, and, determine, results, although, the, original, slot, machine, used, five, reels, simpler, and, therefore, more, reliable, three, reel, machines, quickly, became, the, standard, a, problem, with, three, reel, machines, is, that, the, number, of, combinations, is, only, cubic, the, original, slot, machine, with, three, physical, reels, and, 10, symbols, on, each, reel, had, only, 10, 3, 1, 000, possible, combinations, this, limited, the, manufacturer, s, ability, to, offer, large, jackpots, since, even, the, rarest, event, had, a, likelihood, of, 0, 1, the, maximum, theoretical, payout, assuming, 100, return, to, player, would, be, 1000, times, the, bet, but, that, would, leave, no, room, for, other, pays, making, the, machine, very, high, risk, and, also, quite, boring, although, the, number, of, symbols, eventually, increased, to, about, 22, allowing, 10, 648, combinations, this, still, limited, jackpot, sizes, as, well, as, the, number, of, possible, outcomes, in, the, 1980s, however, slot, machine, manufacturers, incorporated, electronics, into, their, products, and, programmed, them, to, weight, particular, symbols, thus, the, odds, of, losing, symbols, appearing, on, the, payline, became, disproportionate, to, their, actual, frequency, on, the, physical, reel, a, symbol, would, only, appear, once, on, the, reel, displayed, to, the, player, but, could, in, fact, occupy, several, stops, on, the, multiple, reel, in, 1984, inge, telnaes, received, a, patent, for, a, device, titled, electronic, gaming, device, utilizing, a, random, number, generator, for, selecting, the, reel, stop, positions, us, patent, 4448419, which, states, it, is, important, to, make, a, machine, that, is, perceived, to, present, greater, chances, of, payoff, than, it, actually, has, within, the, legal, limitations, that, games, of, chance, must, operate, the, patent, was, later, bought, by, international, game, technology, and, has, since, expired, a, virtual, reel, that, has, 256, virtual, stops, per, reel, would, allow, up, to, 256, 3, 16, 777, 216, final, positions, the, manufacturer, could, choose, to, offer, a, 1, million, jackpot, on, a, 1, bet, confident, that, it, will, only, happen, over, the, long, term, once, every, 16, 8, million, plays, with, microprocessors, now, ubiquitous, the, computers, inside, modern, slot, machines, allow, manufacturers, to, assign, a, different, probability, to, every, symbol, on, every, reel, to, the, player, it, might, appear, that, a, winning, symbol, was, so, close, whereas, in, fact, the, probability, is, much, lower, in, the, 1980s, in, the, u, k, machines, embodying, microprocessors, became, common, these, used, a, number, of, features, to, ensure, the, payout, was, controlled, within, the, limits, of, the, gambling, legislation, as, a, coin, was, inserted, into, the, machine, it, could, go, either, directly, into, the, cashbox, for, the, benefit, of, the, owner, or, into, a, channel, that, formed, the, payout, reservoir, with, the, microprocessor, monitoring, the, number, of, coins, in, this, channel, the, drums, themselves, were, driven, by, stepper, motors, controlled, by, the, processor, and, with, proximity, sensors, monitoring, the, position, of, the, drums, a, look, up, table, within, the, software, allows, the, processor, to, know, what, symbols, were, being, displayed, on, the, drums, to, the, gambler, this, allowed, the, system, to, control, the, level, of, payout, by, stopping, the, drums, at, positions, it, had, determined, if, the, payout, channel, had, filled, up, the, payout, became, more, generous, if, nearly, empty, the, payout, became, less, so, thus, giving, good, control, of, the, odds, video, slot, machines, do, not, use, mechanical, reels, but, use, graphical, reels, on, a, computerized, display, as, there, are, no, mechanical, constraints, on, the, design, of, video, slot, machines, games, often, use, at, least, five, reels, and, may, also, use, non, standard, layouts, this, greatly, expands, the, number, of, possibilities, a, machine, can, have, 50, or, more, symbols, on, a, reel, giving, odds, as, high, as, 300, million, to, 1, against, enough, for, even, the, largest, jackpot, as, there, are, so, many, combinations, possible, with, five, reels, manufacturers, do, not, need, to, weight, the, payout, symbols, although, some, may, still, do, so, instead, higher, paying, symbols, will, typically, appear, only, once, or, twice, on, each, reel, while, more, common, symbols, earning, a, more, frequent, payout, will, appear, many, times, video, slot, machines, usually, make, more, extensive, use, of, multimedia, and, can, feature, more, elaborate, minigames, as, bonuses, modern, cabinets, typically, use, flat, panel, displays, but, cabinets, using, larger, curved, screens, which, can, provide, a, more, immersive, experience, for, the, player, are, not, uncommon, video, slot, machines, typically, encourage, the, player, to, play, multiple, lines, rather, than, simply, taking, the, middle, of, the, three, symbols, displayed, on, each, reel, a, line, could, go, from, top, left, to, the, bottom, right, or, any, other, pattern, specified, by, the, manufacturer, as, each, symbol, is, equally, likely, there, is, no, difficulty, for, the, manufacturer, in, allowing, the, player, to, take, as, many, of, the, possible, lines, on, offer, as, desired, the, long, term, return, to, the, player, will, be, the, same, the, difference, for, the, player, is, that, the, more, lines, they, play, the, more, likely, they, are, to, get, paid, on, a, given, spin, because, they, are, betting, more, to, avoid, seeming, as, if, the, player, s, money, is, simply, ebbing, away, whereas, a, payout, of, 100, credits, on, a, single, line, machine, would, be, 100, bets, and, the, player, would, feel, they, had, made, a, substantial, win, on, a, 20, line, machine, it, would, only, be, five, bets, and, not, seem, as, significant, manufacturers, commonly, offer, bonus, games, which, can, return, many, times, their, bet, the, player, is, encouraged, to, keep, playing, to, reach, the, bonus, even, if, they, are, losing, the, bonus, game, could, allow, them, to, win, back, their, losses, slot, machines, are, typically, programmed, to, pay, out, as, winnings, 0, to, 99, of, the, money, that, is, wagered, by, players, this, is, known, as, the, theoretical, payout, percentage, or, rtp, return, to, player, the, minimum, theoretical, payout, percentage, varies, among, jurisdictions, and, is, typically, established, by, law, or, regulation, for, example, the, minimum, payout, in, nevada, is, 75, in, new, jersey, 83, and, in, mississippi, 80, the, winning, patterns, on, slot, machines, the, amounts, they, pay, and, the, frequencies, of, those, payouts, are, carefully, selected, to, yield, a, certain, fraction, of, the, money, paid, to, the, house, the, operator, of, the, slot, machine, while, returning, the, rest, to, the, players, during, play, suppose, that, a, certain, slot, machine, costs, 1, per, spin, and, has, a, return, to, player, rtp, of, 95, it, can, be, calculated, that, over, a, sufficiently, long, period, such, as, 1, 000, 000, spins, the, machine, will, return, an, average, of, 950, 000, to, its, players, who, have, inserted, 1, 000, 000, during, that, time, in, this, simplified, example, the, slot, machine, is, said, to, pay, out, 95, the, operator, keeps, the, remaining, 50, 000, within, some, egm, development, organizations, this, concept, is, referred, to, simply, as, par, par, also, manifests, itself, to, gamblers, as, promotional, techniques, our, loose, slots, have, a, 93, payback, play, now, a, slot, machine, s, theoretical, payout, percentage, is, set, at, the, factory, when, the, software, is, written, changing, the, payout, percentage, after, a, slot, machine, has, been, placed, on, the, gaming, floor, requires, a, physical, swap, of, the, software, or, firmware, which, is, usually, stored, on, an, eprom, but, may, be, loaded, onto, non, volatile, random, access, memory, nvram, or, even, stored, on, cd, rom, or, dvd, depending, on, the, capabilities, of, the, machine, and, the, applicable, regulations, based, on, current, technology, this, is, a, time, consuming, process, and, as, such, is, done, infrequently, in, certain, jurisdictions, such, as, new, jersey, the, eprom, has, a, tamper, evident, seal, and, can, only, be, changed, in, the, presence, of, gaming, control, board, officials, other, jurisdictions, including, nevada, randomly, audit, slot, machines, to, ensure, that, they, contain, only, approved, software, historically, many, casinos, both, online, and, offline, have, been, unwilling, to, publish, individual, game, rtp, figures, making, it, impossible, for, the, player, to, know, whether, they, are, playing, a, loose, or, a, tight, game, since, the, turn, of, the, century, some, information, regarding, these, figures, has, started, to, come, into, the, public, domain, either, through, various, casinos, releasing, them, primarily, this, applies, to, online, casinos, or, through, studies, by, independent, gambling, authorities, the, return, to, player, is, not, the, only, statistic, that, is, of, interest, the, probabilities, of, every, payout, on, the, pay, table, is, also, critical, for, example, consider, a, hypothetical, slot, machine, with, a, dozen, different, values, on, the, pay, table, however, the, probabilities, of, getting, all, the, payouts, are, zero, except, the, largest, one, if, the, payout, is, 4, 000, times, the, input, amount, and, it, happens, every, 4, 000, times, on, average, the, return, to, player, is, exactly, 100, but, the, game, would, be, dull, to, play, also, most, people, would, not, win, anything, and, having, entries, on, the, paytable, that, have, a, return, of, zero, would, be, deceptive, as, these, individual, probabilities, are, closely, guarded, secrets, it, is, possible, that, the, advertised, machines, with, high, return, to, player, simply, increase, the, probabilities, of, these, jackpots, the, casino, could, legally, place, machines, of, a, similar, style, payout, and, advertise, that, some, machines, have, 100, return, to, player, the, added, advantage, is, that, these, large, jackpots, increase, the, excitement, of, the, other, players, the, table, of, probabilities, for, a, specific, machine, is, called, the, probability, and, accounting, report, or, par, sheet, also, pars, commonly, understood, as, paytable, and, reel, strips, mathematician, michael, shackleford, revealed, the, pars, for, one, commercial, slot, machine, an, original, international, gaming, technology, red, white, and, blue, machine, this, game, in, its, original, form, is, obsolete, so, these, specific, probabilities, do, not, apply, he, only, published, the, odds, after, a, fan, of, his, sent, him, some, information, provided, on, a, slot, machine, that, was, posted, on, a, machine, in, the, netherlands, the, psychology, of, the, machine, design, is, quickly, revealed, there, are, 13, possible, payouts, ranging, from, 1, 1, to, 2, 400, 1, the, 1, 1, payout, comes, every, 8, plays, the, 5, 1, payout, comes, every, 33, plays, whereas, the, 2, 1, payout, comes, every, 600, plays, most, players, assume, the, likelihood, increases, proportionate, to, the, payout, the, one, mid, size, payout, that, is, designed, to, give, the, player, a, thrill, is, the, 80, 1, payout, it, is, programmed, to, occur, an, average, of, once, every, 219, plays, the, 80, 1, payout, is, high, enough, to, create, excitement, but, not, high, enough, that, it, makes, it, likely, that, the, player, will, take, their, winnings, and, abandon, the, game, more, than, likely, the, player, began, the, game, with, at, least, 80, times, his, bet, for, instance, there, are, 80, quarters, in, 20, in, contrast, the, 150, 1, payout, occurs, only, on, average, of, once, every, 6, 241, plays, the, highest, payout, of, 2, 400, 1, occurs, only, on, average, of, once, every, 64, 3, 262, 144, plays, since, the, machine, has, 64, virtual, stops, the, player, who, continues, to, feed, the, machine, is, likely, to, have, several, mid, size, payouts, but, unlikely, to, have, a, large, payout, he, quits, after, he, is, bored, or, has, exhausted, his, bankroll, despite, their, confidentiality, occasionally, a, par, sheet, is, posted, on, a, website, they, have, limited, value, to, the, player, because, usually, a, machine, will, have, 8, to, 12, different, possible, programs, with, varying, payouts, in, addition, slight, variations, of, each, machine, e, g, with, double, jackpots, or, five, times, play, are, always, being, developed, the, casino, operator, can, choose, which, eprom, chip, to, install, in, any, particular, machine, to, select, the, payout, desired, the, result, is, that, there, is, not, really, such, a, thing, as, a, high, payback, type, of, machine, since, every, machine, potentially, has, multiple, settings, from, october, 2001, to, february, 2002, columnist, michael, shackleford, obtained, par, sheets, for, five, different, nickel, machines, four, igt, games, austin, powers, fortune, cookie, leopard, spots, and, wheel, of, fortune, and, one, game, manufactured, by, wms, reel, em, in, without, revealing, the, proprietary, information, he, developed, a, program, that, would, allow, him, to, determine, with, usually, less, than, a, dozen, plays, on, each, machine, which, eprom, chip, was, installed, then, he, did, a, survey, of, over, 400, machines, in, 70, different, casinos, in, las, vegas, he, averaged, the, data, and, assigned, an, average, payback, percentage, to, the, machines, in, each, casino, the, resultant, list, was, widely, publicized, for, marketing, purposes, especially, by, the, palms, casino, which, had, the, top, ranking, one, reason, that, the, slot, machine, is, so, profitable, to, a, casino, is, that, the, player, must, play, the, high, house, edge, and, high, payout, wagers, along, with, the, low, house, edge, and, low, payout, wagers, in, a, more, traditional, wagering, game, like, craps, the, player, knows, that, certain, wagers, have, almost, a, 50, 50, chance, of, winning, or, losing, but, they, only, pay, a, limited, multiple, of, the, original, bet, usually, no, higher, than, three, times, other, bets, have, a, higher, house, edge, but, the, player, is, rewarded, with, a, bigger, win, up, to, thirty, times, in, craps, the, player, can, choose, what, kind, of, wager, he, wants, to, make, a, slot, machine, does, not, afford, such, an, opportunity, theoretically, the, operator, could, make, these, probabilities, available, or, allow, the, player, to, choose, which, one, so, that, the, player, is, free, to, make, a, choice, however, no, operator, has, ever, enacted, this, strategy, different, machines, have, different, maximum, payouts, but, without, knowing, the, odds, of, getting, the, jackpot, there, is, no, rational, way, to, differentiate, in, many, markets, where, central, monitoring, and, control, systems, are, used, to, link, machines, for, auditing, and, security, purposes, usually, in, wide, area, networks, of, multiple, venues, and, thousands, of, machines, player, return, must, usually, be, changed, from, a, central, computer, rather, than, at, each, machine, a, range, of, percentages, is, set, in, the, game, software, and, selected, remotely, in, 2006, the, nevada, gaming, commission, began, working, with, las, vegas, casinos, on, technology, that, would, allow, the, casino, s, management, to, change, the, game, the, odds, and, the, payouts, remotely, the, change, cannot, be, done, instantaneously, but, only, after, the, selected, machine, has, been, idle, for, at, least, four, minutes, after, the, change, is, made, the, machine, must, be, locked, to, new, players, for, four, minutes, and, display, an, on, screen, message, informing, potential, players, that, a, change, is, being, made, some, varieties, of, slot, machines, can, be, linked, together, in, a, setup, sometimes, known, as, a, community, game, the, most, basic, form, of, this, setup, involves, progressive, jackpots, that, are, shared, between, the, bank, of, machines, but, may, include, multiplayer, bonuses, and, other, features, in, some, cases, multiple, machines, are, linked, across, multiple, casinos, in, these, cases, the, machines, may, be, owned, by, the, manufacturer, who, is, responsible, for, paying, the, jackpot, the, casinos, lease, the, machines, rather, than, owning, them, outright, casinos, in, new, jersey, nevada, louisiana, arkansas, and, south, dakota, now, offer, multi, state, progressive, jackpots, which, now, offer, bigger, jackpot, pools, mechanical, slot, machines, and, their, coin, acceptors, were, sometimes, susceptible, to, cheating, devices, and, other, scams, one, historical, example, involved, spinning, a, coin, with, a, short, length, of, plastic, wire, the, weight, and, size, of, the, coin, would, be, accepted, by, the, machine, and, credits, would, be, granted, however, the, spin, created, by, the, plastic, wire, would, cause, the, coin, to, exit, through, the, reject, chute, into, the, payout, tray, this, particular, scam, has, become, obsolete, due, to, improvements, in, newer, slot, machines, another, obsolete, method, of, defeating, slot, machines, was, to, use, a, light, source, to, confuse, the, optical, sensor, used, to, count, coins, during, payout, modern, slot, machines, are, controlled, by, eprom, computer, chips, and, in, large, casinos, coin, acceptors, have, become, obsolete, in, favor, of, bill, acceptors, these, machines, and, their, bill, acceptors, are, designed, with, advanced, anti, cheating, and, anti, counterfeiting, measures, and, are, difficult, to, defraud, early, computerized, slot, machines, were, sometimes, defrauded, through, the, use, of, cheating, devices, such, as, the, slider, monkey, paw, lightwand, and, the, tongue, many, of, these, old, cheating, devices, were, made, by, the, late, tommy, glenn, carmichael, a, slot, machine, fraudster, who, reportedly, stole, over, 5, million, in, the, modern, day, computerized, slot, machines, are, fully, deterministic, and, thus, outcomes, can, be, sometimes, successfully, predicted, skill, stop, buttons, predated, the, bally, electromechanical, slot, machines, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, they, appeared, on, mechanical, slot, machines, manufactured, by, mills, novelty, co, as, early, as, the, mid, 1920s, these, machines, had, modified, reel, stop, arms, which, allowed, them, to, be, released, from, the, timing, bar, earlier, than, in, a, normal, play, simply, by, pressing, the, buttons, on, the, front, of, the, machine, located, between, each, reel, skill, stop, buttons, were, added, to, some, slot, machines, by, zacharias, anthony, in, the, early, 1970s, these, enabled, the, player, to, stop, each, reel, allowing, a, degree, of, skill, so, as, to, satisfy, the, new, jersey, gaming, laws, of, the, day, which, required, that, players, were, able, to, control, the, game, in, some, way, the, original, conversion, was, applied, to, approximately, 50, late, model, bally, slot, machines, because, the, typical, machine, stopped, the, reels, automatically, in, less, than, 10, seconds, weights, were, added, to, the, mechanical, timers, to, prolong, the, automatic, stopping, of, the, reels, by, the, time, the, new, jersey, alcoholic, beverages, commission, abc, had, approved, the, conversion, for, use, in, new, jersey, arcades, the, word, was, out, and, every, other, distributor, began, adding, skill, stops, the, machines, were, a, huge, hit, on, the, jersey, shore, and, the, remaining, unconverted, bally, machines, were, destroyed, as, they, had, become, instantly, obsolete, in, the, united, states, the, public, and, private, availability, of, slot, machines, is, highly, regulated, by, state, governments, many, states, have, established, gaming, control, boards, to, regulate, the, possession, and, use, of, slot, machines, and, other, form, of, gaming, nevada, is, the, only, state, that, has, no, significant, restrictions, against, slot, machines, both, for, public, and, private, use, in, new, jersey, slot, machines, are, only, allowed, in, hotel, casinos, operated, in, atlantic, city, several, states, indiana, louisiana, and, missouri, allow, slot, machines, as, well, as, any, casino, style, gambling, only, on, licensed, riverboats, or, permanently, anchored, barges, since, hurricane, katrina, mississippi, has, removed, the, requirement, that, casinos, on, the, gulf, coast, operate, on, barges, and, now, allows, them, on, land, along, the, shoreline, delaware, allows, slot, machines, at, three, horse, tracks, they, are, regulated, by, the, state, lottery, commission, in, wisconsin, bars, and, taverns, are, allowed, to, have, up, to, five, machines, these, machines, usually, allow, a, player, to, either, take, a, payout, or, gamble, it, on, a, double, or, nothing, side, game, the, territory, of, puerto, rico, places, significant, restrictions, on, slot, machine, ownership, but, the, law, is, widely, flouted, and, slot, machines, are, common, in, bars, and, coffeeshops, in, regards, to, tribal, casinos, located, on, native, american, reservations, slot, machines, played, against, the, house, and, operating, independently, from, a, centralized, computer, system, are, classified, as, class, iii, gaming, by, the, indian, gaming, regulatory, act, igra, and, sometimes, promoted, as, vegas, style, slot, machines, in, order, to, offer, class, iii, gaming, tribes, must, enter, into, a, compact, agreement, with, the, state, that, is, approved, by, the, department, of,

that, includes, games, where, players, play, exclusively, against, at, least, one, other, opponent, and, not, the, house, such, as, bingo, or, any, related, games, such, as, pull, tabs, in, these,

australia, poker, machines, or, pokies, are, officially, termed, gaming, machines, in, australia, gaming, machines, are, a, matter, for, state, governments, so, laws, vary, between, states, gaming, machines, are, found, in, casinos, approximately, one, in, each, major, city, pubs, and, clubs, in, some, states, usually, sports, social, or, rsl, clubs, the, first, australian, state, to, legalize, this, style, of, gambling, was, new, south, wales, when, in, 1956, they, were, made, legal, in, all, registered, clubs, in, the, state, there, are, suggestions, that, the, proliferation, of, poker, machines, has, led, to, increased, levels, of, problem, gambling, however, the, precise, nature, of, this, link, is, still, open, to, research, in, 1999, the, australian, productivity, commission, reported, that, nearly, half, australia, s, gaming, machines, were, in, new, south, wales, at, the, time, 21, of, all, the, gambling, machines, in, the, world, were, operating, in, australia, and, on, a, per, capita, basis, australia, had, roughly, five, times, as, many, gaming, machines, as, the, united, states, australia, ranks, 8th, in, total, number, of, gaming, machines, after, japan, u, s, a, italy, u, k, spain, and, germany, this, primarily, is, because, gaming, machines, have, been, legal, in, the, state, of, new, south, wales, since, 1956, over, time, the, number, of, machines, has, grown, to, 97, 103, at, december, 2010, including, the, australian, capital, territory, by, way, of, comparison, the, u, s, state, of, nevada, which, legalised, gaming, including, slots, several, decades, before, n, s, w, had, 190, 135, slots, operating, revenue, from, gaming, machines, in, pubs, and, clubs, accounts, for, more, than, half, of, the, 4, billion, in, gambling, revenue, collected, by, state, governments, in, fiscal, year, 2002, 03, in, queensland, gaming, machines, in, pubs, and, clubs, must, provide, a, return, rate, of, 85, while, machines, located, in, casinos, must, provide, a, return, rate, of, 90, most, other, states, have, similar, provisions, in, victoria, gaming, machines, must, provide, a, minimum, return, rate, of, at, least, 85, including, jackpot, contribution, are, prohibited, from, accepting, bills, greater, than, 50, in, denomination, and, each, wager, must, be, manually, initiated, by, the, player, thus, prohibiting, autoplay, mechanisms, western, australia, has, the, most, restrictive, regulations, on, electronic, gaming, machines, egms, in, general, they, may, only, be, operated, at, the, crown, perth, casino, resort, which, is, the, only, casino, in, western, australia, and, have, a, return, rate, of, 90, many, egms, operate, games, that, are, nearly, identical, to, slot, machines, but, with, modifications, to, comply, with,

playing, is, a, mindless, repetitive, and, insidious, form, of, gambling, which, has, many, undesirable, features, it, requires, no, thought, no, skill, or, social, contact, the, odds, are, never, about, winning, watching, people, playing, the, machines, over, long, periods, of, time, the, impressionistic, evidence, at, least, is, that, they, are, addictive, to, many, people, historically, poker, machines, have, been, banned, from, western, australia, and, we, consider, that, in, the, public, interest, they, should, stay, banned, despite, the, state, having, praised, its, restrictions, for, keeping, gaming, machines, from, being, widely, available, to, the, public, as, in, other, states, the, machines, have, faced, criticism, for, being, almost, indistinguishable, to, a, normal,
