one, name, or, another, have, been, established, by, law, in, several, mostly, developed, countries, in, order, to, provide, legal, recognition, of, relationships, formed, by, unmarried, same, sex, couples, and, to, afford, them, rights, benefits, tax, breaks, and, responsibilities, similar, or, identical, to, those, of, legally, married, couples, in, 1989, denmark, was, the, first, country, to, legalise, civil, unions, for, same, sex, couples, however, most, other, developed, democracies, did, not, begin, establishing, civil, unions, until, the, 1990s, or, early, 2000s, often, developing, them, from, less, formal, domestic, partnerships, while, civil, unions, are, often, established, for, both, opposite, sex, couples, and, same, sex, couples, in, a, number, of, countries, they, are, available, to, same, sex, couples, only, in, brazil, civil, unions, were, first, created, for, opposite, sex, couples, in, 2002, and, then, expanded, to, include, same, sex, couples, through, a, supreme, court, ruling, in, 2011, in, the, majority, of, countries, that, established, same, sex, civil, unions, they, have, since, been, either, supplemented, or, replaced, by, same, sex, marriage, civil, unions, are, viewed, by, lgbt, rights, campaigners, as, a, first, step, towards, establishing, same, sex, marriage, as, civil, unions, are, viewed, by, supporters, of, lgbt, rights, as, a, separate, but, equal, or, second, class, status, many, jurisdictions, with, civil, unions, recognize, foreign, unions, if, those, are, essentially, equivalent, to, their, own, for, example, the, united, kingdom, lists, equivalent, unions, in, the, civil, partnership, act, 2004, schedule, 20, the, marriages, of, same, sex, couples, performed, abroad, may, be, recognized, as, civil, unions, in, jurisdictions, that, only, have, the, latter, the, terms, used, to, designate, civil, unions, are, not, standardized, and, vary, widely, from, country, to, country, government, sanctioned, relationships, that, may, be, similar, or, equivalent, to, civil, unions, include, civil, partnerships, registered, partnerships, domestic, partnerships, significant, relationships, reciprocal, beneficiary, relationships, common, law, marriage, adult, interdependent, relationships, life, partnerships, stable, unions, civil, solidarity, pacts, and, so, on, the, exact, level, of, rights, benefits, obligations, and, responsibilities, also, varies, depending, on, the, laws, of, a, particular, country, some, jurisdictions, allow, same, sex, couples, to, adopt, while, others, forbid, them, to, do, so, or, allow, adoption, only, in, specified, circumstances, in, the, united, states, the, term, civil, union, was, introduced, in, the, state, of, vermont, in, 2000, to, connote, a, status, equivalent, to, marriage, for, same, sex, couples, it, was, chosen, by, the, state, s, legislators, in, preference, to, phrases, such, as, domestic, partner, relationship, or, civil, accord, domestic, partnership, offered, by, some, states, counties, cities, and, employers, since, as, early, as, 1985, has, generally, connoted, a, lesser, status, with, fewer, benefits, however, the, legislatures, of, the, west, coast, states, of, california, oregon, and, washington, have, preferred, the, term, domestic, partnership, for, enactments, similar, or, equivalent, to, civil, union, laws, in, east, coast, states, civil, unions, are, not, seen, as, a, replacement, for, marriage, by, many, in, the, lgbt, community, marriage, in, the, united, states, is, a, civil, union, but, a, civil, union, as, it, has, come, to, be, called, is, not, marriage, said, evan, wolfson, of, freedom, to, marry, it, is, a, proposed, hypothetical, legal, mechanism, since, it, doesn, t, exist, in, most, places, to, give, some, of, the, protections, but, also, withhold, something, precious, from, gay, people, there, s, no, good, reason, to, do, that, however, some, opponents, of, same, sex, marriage, claim, that, civil, unions, rob, marriage, of, its, unique, status, randy, thomasson, executive, director, of, the, campaign, for, california, families, calls, civil, unions, homosexual, marriage, by, another, name, and, contends, that, civil, unions, provide, same, sex, couples, all, the, rights, of, marriage, available, under, state, law, the, california, supreme, court, in, the, in, re, marriage, cases, decision, noted, nine, differences, in, state, law, civil, unions, are, commonly, criticised, as, being, separate, but, equal, critics, such, as, former, new, zealand, mp, and, feminist, marilyn, waring, note, that, same, sex, couples, remain, excluded, from, the, right, to, marry, and, are, forced, to, use, a, separate, institution, supporters, of, same, sex, marriage, contend, that, treating, same, sex, couples, differently, from, other, couples, under, the, law, allows, for, inferior, treatment, and, that, if, civil, unions, were, the, same, as, marriage, there, would, be, no, reason, for, two, separate, laws, a, new, jersey, commission, which, reviewed, the, state, s, civil, union, law, reported, that, the, law, invites, and, encourages, unequal, treatment, of, same, sex, couples, and, their, children, some, have, suggested, that, creating, civil, unions, which, are, open, to, opposite, sex, couples, would, avoid, the, accusations, of, apartheid, proponents, of, civil, unions, say, that, they, provide, practical, equality, for, same, sex, couples, and, solve, the, problems, over, areas, such, as, hospital, visitation, rights, and, transfer, of, property, caused, by, lack, of, legal, recognition, proponents, also, say, that, creating, civil, unions, is, a, more, pragmatic, way, to, ensure, that, same, sex, couples, have, legal, rights, as, it, avoids, the, more, controversial, issues, surrounding, marriage, and, the, claim, that, the, term, has, a, religious, source, many, supporters, of, same, sex, marriage, state, that, the, word, marriage, matters, and, that, the, term, civil, union, and, its, equivalents, do, not, convey, the, emotional, meaning, or, bring, the, respect, that, comes, with, marriage, former, us, solicitor, general, and, attorney, in, the, perry, v, schwarzenegger, case, theodore, olsen, said, that, recognizing, same, sex, couples, under, the, term, domestic, partnership, stigmatizes, gay, people, s, relationships, treating, them, as, if, they, were, something, akin, to, a, commercial, venture, not, a, loving, union, many, also, contend, that, the, fact, that, civil, unions, are, often, not, understood, can, cause, difficulty, for, same, sex, couples, in, emergency, situations, as, of, july, 18, 2024, the, states, that, provide, civil, unions, but, not, marriage, for, same, sex, couples, are, the, catholic, church, under, pope, francis, endorses, civil, unions, but, opposes, same, sex, marriage, in, israel, no, national, domestic, authority, performs, same, sex, marriage, though,
