snowboarding, is, a, recreational, and, competitive, activity, that, involves, descending, a, snow, covered, surface, while, standing, on, a, snowboard, that, is, almost, always, attached, to, a, rider, s, feet, it, features, in, the, winter, olympic, games, and, winter, paralympic, games, snowboarding, was, developed, in, the, united, states, inspired, by, skateboarding, sledding, surfing, and, skiing, it, became, popular, around, the, world, and, was, introduced, as, a, winter, olympic, sport, at, nagano, in, 1998, and, featured, in, the, winter, paralympics, at, sochi, in, 2014, as, of, 2015, its, popularity, as, measured, by, equipment, sales, in, the, united, states, peaked, in, 2007, and, has, been, in, a, decline, since, the, first, snowboards, were, developed, in, 1965, when, sherm, poppen, an, engineer, in, muskegon, michigan, invented, a, toy, for, his, daughters, by, fastening, two, skis, together, and, attaching, a, rope, to, one, end, so, he, would, have, some, control, as, they, stood, on, the, board, and, glided, downhill, dubbed, the, snurfer, combining, snow, and, surfer, by, his, wife, nancy, the, toy, proved, so, popular, among, his, daughters, friends, that, poppen, licensed, the, idea, to, a, manufacturer, brunswick, corporation, that, sold, about, a, million, snurfers, over, the, next, decade, and, in, 1966, alone, over, half, a, million, snurfers, were, sold, modern, snowboarding, was, pioneered, by, tom, sims, and, jake, burton, carpenter, who, both, contributed, significant, innovations, and, started, influential, companies, in, february, 1968, poppen, organized, the, first, snurfing, competition, at, a, michigan, ski, resort, that, attracted, enthusiasts, from, all, over, the, country, one, of, those, early, pioneers, was, tom, sims, a, devotee, of, skateboarding, a, sport, born, in, the, 1950s, when, kids, attached, roller, skate, wheels, to, small, boards, that, they, steered, by, shifting, their, weight, in, the, 1960s, as, an, eighth, grader, in, haddonfield, new, jersey, sims, crafted, a, snowboard, in, his, school, shop, class, by, gluing, carpet, to, the, top, of, a, piece, of, wood, and, attaching, aluminum, sheeting, to, the, bottom, he, produced, commercial, snowboards, in, the, mid, 70s, including, the, skiboard, also, known, as, the, lonnie, toft, flying, banana, a, molded, polyethylene, bottom, with, a, lonnie, toft, signature, skateboard, deck, attached, to, the, top, others, experimented, with, board, on, snow, configurations, at, this, time, including, welsh, skateboard, enthusiasts, jon, roberts, and, pete, matthews, developed, their, own, snowboards, to, use, at, their, local, dry, ski, slope, also, during, this, same, period, in, 1977, jake, burton, carpenter, a, vermont, native, who, had, enjoyed, snurfing, since, the, age, of, 14, impressed, the, crowd, at, a, michigan, snurfing, competition, with, bindings, he, had, designed, to, secure, his, feet, to, the, board, that, same, year, he, founded, burton, snowboards, in, londonderry, vermont, the, snowboards, were, made, of, wooden, planks, that, were, flexible, and, had, water, ski, foot, traps, very, few, people, picked, up, snowboarding, because, the, price, of, the, board, was, considered, too, high, at, 38, and, were, not, allowed, on, many, ski, hills, but, eventually, burton, would, become, the, biggest, snowboarding, company, in, the, business, burton, s, early, designs, for, boards, with, bindings, became, the, dominant, features, in, snowboarding, the, first, competitions, to, offer, prize, money, were, the, national, snurfing, championship, held, at, muskegon, state, park, in, muskegon, michigan, in, 1979, jake, burton, carpenter, came, from, vermont, to, compete, with, a, snowboard, of, his, own, design, there, were, protests, about, jake, entering, with, a, non, snurfer, board, paul, graves, and, others, advocated, that, jake, be, allowed, to, race, a, modified, open, division, was, created, and, won, by, jake, as, the, sole, entrant, that, race, was, considered, the, first, competition, for, snowboarding, and, is, the, start, of, what, became, competitive, snowboarding, ken, kampenga, john, asmussen, and, jim, trim, placed, first, second, and, third, respectively, in, the, standard, competition, with, best, two, combined, times, of, 24, 71, 25, 02, and, 25, 41, and, jake, carpenter, won, prize, money, as, the, sole, entrant, in, the, open, division, with, a, time, of, 26, 35, in, 1980, the, event, moved, to, pando, winter, sports, park, near, grand, rapids, michigan, because, of, a, lack, of, snow, that, year, at, the, original, venue, in, the, early, 1980s, aleksey, ostatnigrosh, and, alexei, melnikov, two, snurfers, from, the, soviet, union, patented, design, changes, to, the, snurfer, to, allow, jumping, by, attaching, a, bungee, cord, a, single, footed, binding, to, the, snurfer, tail, and, a, two, foot, binding, design, for, improved, control, as, snowboarding, became, more, popular, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, pioneers, such, as, dimitrije, milovich, founder, of, winterstick, out, of, salt, lake, city, utah, jake, burton, carpenter, founder, of, burton, snowboards, from, londonderry, vermont, tom, sims, founder, of, sims, snowboards, david, kemper, founder, of, kemper, snowboards, and, mike, olson, founder, of, gnu, snowboards, came, up, with, new, designs, for, boards, and, mechanisms, that, slowly, developed, into, the, snowboards, and, other, related, equipment, from, these, developments, modern, snowboarding, equipment, usually, consists, of, a, snowboard, with, specialized, bindings, and, boots, in, april, 1981, the, king, of, the, mountain, snowboard, competition, was, held, at, ski, cooper, in, colorado, tom, sims, along, with, an, assortment, of, other, snowboarders, of, the, time, were, present, one, entrant, showed, up, on, a, homemade, snowboard, with, a, formica, bottom, that, turned, out, to, not, slide, so, well, on, the, snow, in, 1982, the, first, usa, national, snowboard, race, was, held, near, woodstock, vermont, at, suicide, six, the, race, organized, by, graves, was, won, by, burton, s, first, team, rider, doug, bouton, in, 1983, the, first, world, championship, halfpipe, competition, was, held, at, soda, springs, california, tom, sims, founder, of, sims, snowboards, organized, the, event, with, the, help, of, mike, chantry, a, snowboard, instructor, at, soda, springs, in, 1985, the, first, world, cup, was, held, in, z, rs, austria, further, cementing,

pace, than, the, winter, sports, public, indeed, for, many, years, there, was, animosity, between, skiers, and, snowboarders, which, led, to, an, ongoing, skier, vs, snowboarder, feud, early, snowboards, were, banned, from, the, slopes, by, park, officials, for, several, years, snowboarders, would, have, to, take, a, small, skills, assessment, prior, to, being, allowed, to, ride, the, chairlifts, it, was, thought, that, an, unskilled, snowboarder, would, wipe, the, snow, off, the, mountain, in, 1985, only, seven, percent, of, u, s, ski, areas, allowed, snowboarding, with, a, similar, proportion, in, europe, as, equipment, and, skills, improved, gradually, snowboarding, became, more, accepted, in, 1990, most, major, ski, areas, had, separate, slopes, for, snowboarders, now, approximately, 97, of, all, ski, areas, in, north, america, and, europe, allow, snowboarding, and, more, than, half, have, jumps, rails, and, half, pipes, in, 2004, snowboarding, had, 6, 6, million, active, participants, an, industry, spokesman, said, that, twelve, year, olds, are, out, riding, adults, the, same, article, said, that, most, snowboarders, are, 18, 24, years, old, and, that, women, constitute, 25, of, participants, there, were, 8, 2, million, snowboarders, in, the, us, and, canada, for, the, 2009, 2010, season, there, was, a, 10, increase, over, the, previous,

established, winter, sport, it, has, developed, various, styles, each, with, its, own, specialized, equipment, and, technique, the, most, common, styles, today, are, freeride, freestyle, and, freecarve, race, these, styles, are, used, for, both, recreational, and, professional, snowboarding, while, each, style, is, unique, there, is, overlap, between, them, jibbing, is, the, term, for, technical, riding, on, non, standard, surfaces, the, word, jib, is, both, a, noun, and, a, verb, depending, on, the, usage, of, the, word, as, a, noun, a, jib, includes, metal, rails, boxes, benches, concrete, ledges, walls, vehicles, rocks, and, logs, as, a, verb, to, jib, is, referring, to, the, action, of, jumping, sliding, or, riding, on, top, of, objects, other, than, snow, it, is, directly, influenced, by, grinding, a, skateboard, jibbing, is, a, freestyle, snowboarding, technique, of, riding, typically, jibbing, occurs, in, a, snowboard, resort, park, but, can, also, be, done, in,

styles, in, a, fluid, motion, and, spontaneity, through, naturally, rugged, terrain, it, can, be, like, freestyle, with, the, exception, that, no, man, made, features, are, utilized, see, also, backcountry, snowboarding, freestyle, snowboarding, is, any, riding, that, includes, performing, tricks, in, freestyle, the, rider, utilizes, natural, and, man, made, features, such, as, rails, jumps, boxes, and, innumerable, others, to, perform, tricks, it, is, a, popular, all, inclusive, concept, that, distinguishes, the, creative, aspects, of, snowboarding, in, contrast, to, a, style, like, alpine, snowboarding, alpine, snowboarding, is, a, discipline, within, the, sport, of, snowboarding, it, is, practiced, on, groomed, pistes, it, has, been, an, olympic, event, since, 1998, sometimes, called, freecarving, or, hardbooting, due, to, the, equipment, used, this, discipline, usually, takes, place, on, hard, packed, snow, or, groomed, runs, although, it, can, be, practiced, in, any, and, all, conditions, and, focuses, on, carving, linked, turns, much, like, surfing, or, longboarding, little, or, no, jumping, takes, place, in, this, discipline, alpine, snowboarding, consists, of, a, small, portion, of, the, general, snowboard, population, that, has, a, well, connected, social, community, and, its, own, specific, board, manufacturers, most, situated, in, europe, alpine, snowboard, equipment, includes, a, ski, like, hardshell, boot, and, plate, binding, system, with, a, true, directional, snowboard, that, is, stiffer, and, narrower, to, manage, linking, turns, with, greater, forces, and, speed, shaped, skis, can, thank, these, freecarve, snowboards, for, the, cutting, edge, technology, leading, to, their, creation, a, skilled, alpine, snowboarder, can, link, numerous, turns, into, a, run, placing, their, body, very, close, to, the, ground, each, turn, similar, to, a, motocross, turn, or, waterski, carve, depending, on, factors, including, stiffness, turning, radius, and, personality, this, can, be, done, slowly, or, fast, carvers, make, perfect, half, circles, out, of, each, turn, changing, edges, when, the, snowboard, is, perpendicular, to, the, fall, line, and, starting, every, turn, on, the, downhill, edge, carving, on, a, snowboard, is, like, riding, a, roller, coaster, because, the, board, will, lock, into, a, turn, radius, and, provide, what, feels, like, multiple, gs, of, acceleration, alpine, snowboarding, shares, more, visual, similarities, with, skiing, equipment, than, it, does, with, snowboarding, equipment, compared, to, freestyle,

rails, jumps, jibs, or, anything, else, the, board, or, rider, can, slide, across, slopestyle, is, a, judged, event, and, winning, a, slopestyle, contest, usually, comes, from, successfully, executing, the, most, difficult, line, in, the, terrain, park, while, having, a, smooth, flowing, line, of, difficult, mistake, free, tricks, performed, on, the, obstacles, however, overall, impression, and, style, can, play, a, factor, in, winning, a, slopestyle, contest, and, the, rider, who, lands, the, hardest, tricks, will, not, always, win, over, the, rider, who, lands, easier,

competitors, earn, points, towards, a, national, ranking, and, qualify, to, compete, at, the, usasa, national, championships, the, snowboarding, way, of, life, came, about, as, a, natural, response, to, the, culture, from, which, it, emerged, early, on, there, was, a, rebellion, against, skiing, culture, and, the, view, that, snowboarders, were, inferior, skiers, did, not, easily, accept, this, new, culture, on, their, slopes, the, two, cultures, contrasted, each, other, in, several, ways, including, how, they, spoke, acted, and, their, entire, style, of, clothing, snowboarders, first, embraced, the, punk, and, later, the, hip, hop, look, into, their, style, words, such, as, dude, gnarly, and, shred, the, gnar, are, some, examples, of, words, used, in, the, snowboarding, culture, snowboarding, subculture, became, a, crossover, between, the, urban, and, suburban, styles, on, snow, which, made, an, easy, transition, from, surfing, and, skateboarding, culture, over, to, snowboarding, culture, in, fact, many, skateboarders, and, surfers, in, the, winter, months, snowboarded, and, were, the, early, snowboarders, the, early, stereotypes, of, snowboarding, included, lazy, grungy, punk, stoners, troublemakers, and, numerous, others, many, of, which, are, associated, with, skateboarding, and, surfing, as, well, however, these, stereotypes, may, be, considered, out, of, style, snowboarding, has, become, a, sport, that, encompasses, a, very, diverse, international, based, crowd, and, fanbase, of, many, millions, so, much, so, that, it, is, no, longer, possible, to, stereotype, such, a, large, community, reasons, for, these, dying, stereotypes, include, how, mainstream, and, popular, the, sport, has, become, with, the, shock, factor, of, snowboarding, s, quick, take, off, on, the, slopes, wearing, off, skiers, and, snowboarders, are, becoming, used, to, each, other, showing, more, respect, to, each, other, on, the, mountain, the, typical, stereotype, of, the, sport, is, changing, as, the, demographics, change, while, these, two, subcultures, are, now, becoming, accustomed, to, each, other, there, are, still, three, resorts, in, the, united, states, which, do, not, allow, snowboarding, alta, deer, valley, and, mad, river, glen, are, the, last, skiing, only, resorts, in, north, america, and, have, become, a, focal, point, over, time, for, the, remaining, animosity, between, snowboarding, and, skiing, common, injuries, in, snowboarding, differ, between, professional, and, recreational, groups, the, most, common, type, of, injury, for, snowboarders, is, injury, to, the, upper, body, in, recreational, snowboarding, wrist, injuries, are, more, likely, to, occur, among, professional, snowboarders, injuries, to, the, lower, half, specifically, the, knee, joint, are, more, likely, to, occur, when, injured, snowboarders, are, twice, as, likely, to, get, a, fracture, as, skiers, other, minor, injuries, that, happen, are, wrist, injuries, shoulder, soft, tissue, injuries, ankle, injuries, concussions, and, clavicle, fractures, were, seen, injuries, are, very, common, when, snowboarding, in, recreational, and, inexperienced, most, injuries, to, snowboarders, occurred, more, often, while, they, were, traveling, at, reckless, speed, on, moderate, slopes, another, way, injuries, happen, is, because, they, try, sticking, with, someone, that, is, a, higher, skill, level, which, they, are, not, capable, of, handling, because, of, the, lack, of, skill, they, possess, some, major, injuries, that, occur, during, snowboarding, are, head, and, spinal, injuries, the, main, cause, of, spinal, fractures, in, snowboarders, was, jump, landing, failure, and, compression, type, fractures, occur, in, about, 80, of, snowboarders, with, vertebral, fractures, because, they, frequently, fall, backwards, and, this, can, cause, axial, loading, and, anterior, compression, fractures, injuries, to, the, upper, body, are, much, less, common, among, professional, snowboarders, most, of, the, professionals, and, elite, snowboarders, frequently, sustain, injuries, when, trying, to, execute, challenging, tricks, at, high, speeds, and, with, increased, levels, of, force, to, the, lower, limbs, like, some, other, winter, sports, snowboarding, comes, with, a, certain, level, of, risk, the, average, snowboarder, is, a, male, in, their, early, twenties, and, there, are, three, times, as, many, men, as, there, are, women, in, the, sport, snowboarders, have, a, 2, 4, times, greater, risk, of, fractures, than, skiers, particularly, in, the, upper, extremities, conversely, snowboarders, have, a, lower, risk, of, knee, injuries, than, skiers, the, injury, rate, for, snowboarding, is, about, four, to, six, per, thousand, persons, per, day, which, is, around, double, the, injury, rate, for, alpine, skiing, injuries, are, more, likely, amongst, beginners, especially, those, who, do, not, take, lessons, with, professional, instructors, a, quarter, of, all, injuries, occur, to, first, time, riders, and, half, of, all, injuries, occur, to, those, with, less, than, a, year, of, experience, experienced, riders, are, less, likely, to, suffer, injury, but, the, injuries, that, do, occur, tend, to, be, more, severe, two, thirds, of, injuries, occur, to, the, upper, body, and, one, third, to, the, lower, body, this, contrasts, with, alpine, skiing, where, two, thirds, of, injuries, are, to, the, lower, body, the, most, common, types, of, injuries, are, sprains, which, account, for, around, 40, of, injuries, the, most, common, point, of, injury, is, the, wrists, 40, of, all, snowboard, injuries, are, to, the, wrists, and, 24, of, all, snowboard, injuries, are, wrist, fractures, there, are, around, 100, 000, wrist, fractures, worldwide, among, snowboarders, each, year, for, this, reason, the, use, of, wrist, guards, either, separate, or, built, into, gloves, is, very, strongly, recommended, they, are, often, compulsory, in, beginner, s, classes, and, their, use, reduces, the, likelihood, of, wrist, injury, by, half, in, addition, it, is, important, for, snow, boarders, to, learn, how, to, fall, without, stopping, the, fall, with, their, hand, by, trying, to, push, the, slope, away, as, landing, a, wrist, which, is, bent, at, a, 90, degree, angle, increase, the, chance, of, it, breaking, rather, landing, with, the, arms, stretched, out, like, a, wing, and, slapping, the, slope, with, the, entire, arm, is, an, effective, way, to, break, a, fall, this, is, the, method, used, by, practitioners, of, judo, and, other, martial, arts, to, break, a, fall, when, they, are, thrown, against, the, floor, by, a, training, partner, the, risk, of, head, injury, is, two, to, six, times, greater, for, snowboarders, than, for, skiers, and, injuries, follow, the, pattern, of, being, rarer, but, more, severe, with, experienced, riders, head, injuries, can, occur, both, because, of, a, collision, and, when, failing, to, carry, out, a, heel, side, turn, the, latter, can, result, in, the, rider, landing, on, his, or, her, back, and, slamming, the, back, of, his, or, her, head, onto, the, ground, resulting, in, an, occipital, head, injury, for, this, reason, helmets, are, widely, recommended, protective, eyewear, is, also, recommended, as, eye, injury, can, be, caused, by, impact, and, snow, blindness, can, be, a, result, of, exposure, to, strong, ultra, violet, light, in, snow, covered, areas, the, wearing, of, ultra, violet, absorbing, goggles, is, recommended, even,

snowboarders, have, fluctuated, over, time, but, still, remain, higher, than, skiers, no, evidence, was, found, that, those, who, spend, more, time, in, terrain, parks, are, over, represented, in,
