soups, stews, banchan, tteok, chopsticks, are, shaped, pairs, of, equal, length, sticks, that, have, been, used, as, kitchen, and, eating, utensils, in, most, of, east, asia, for, over, three, millennia, they, are, held, in, the, dominant, hand, secured, by, fingers, and, wielded, as, extensions, of, the, hand, to, pick, up, food, originating, in, china, chopsticks, later, spread, to, other, parts, of, continental, asia, chopsticks, have, become, more, accepted, in, connection, with, east, asian, food, in, the, west, especially, in, cities, with, significant, east, asian, diaspora, communities, the, use, of, chopsticks, has, also, spread, to, the, rest, of, southeast, asia, either, via, the, chinese, diaspora, or, through, some, dishes, such, as, noodles, that, may, require, chopsticks, chopsticks, are, smoothed, and, frequently, tapered, they, are, traditionally, made, of, wood, bamboo, metal, ivory, and, ceramics, and, in, modern, days, increasingly, available, in, non, traditional, materials, such, as, plastic, stainless, steel, and, even, titanium, chopsticks, are, often, seen, as, requiring, practice, and, skill, to, master, to, be, used, as, an, eating, utensil, in, some, countries, failing, to, follow, etiquette, in, their, use, is, frowned, upon, though, such, feelings, are, generally, lesser, than, they, once, were, chopsticks, have, been, around, and, used, since, at, least, the, shang, dynasty, 1766, 1122, bce, however, the, han, dynasty, historian, sima, qian, wrote, that, it, is, likely, that, chopsticks, were, also, used, in, the, preceding, xia, dynasty, and, even, the, earlier, erlitou, culture, although, finding, archeological, evidence, from, this, era, is, difficult, the, earliest, evidence, of, chopsticks, uncovered, so, far, consists, of, six, chopsticks, made, of, bronze, 26, centimeters, 10, in, long, and, 1, 1, to, 1, 3, centimeters, 0, 43, to, 0, 51, in, wide, excavated, from, the, ruins, of, yin, near, anyang, henan, these, are, dated, roughly, to, 1200, bce, during, the, shang, dynasty, they, were, supposed, to, have, been, used, for, cooking, the, earliest, known, textual, reference, to, the, use, of, chopsticks, comes, from, the, han, feizi, a, philosophical, text, written, by, han, fei, c, 280, 233, bce, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, wide, diffusion, of, chopsticks, in, the, chinese, culture, is, sometimes, attributed, to, the, confucian, philosophy, that, emphasizes, family, harmony, as, the, basis, for, civil, order, confucius, himself, allegedly, said, that, knives, are, for, warriors, but, chopsticks, are, for, scholars, and, his, successor, mencius, is, linked, to, the, aphorism, the, honorable, and, upright, man, keeps, well, away, from, both, the, slaughterhouse, and, the, kitchen, and, he, allows, no, knives, on, his, table, confucius, reference, to, chopsticks, in, his, book, of, rites, suggests, these, items, were, widely, known, in, the, warring, states, period, c, 475, 221, bc, the, first, chopsticks, were, used, for, cooking, stirring, the, fire, serving, or, seizing, bits, of, food, and, not, as, eating, utensils, one, reason, was, that, before, the, han, dynasty, millet, was, predominant, in, north, china, korea, and, parts, of, japan, while, chopsticks, were, used, for, cooking, millet, porridge, was, eaten, with, spoons, at, that, time, 29, 35, the, use, of, chopsticks, in, the, kitchen, continues, to, this, day, ry, ribashi, are, japanese, kitchen, chopsticks, used, in, japanese, cuisine, they, are, used, in, the, preparation, of, japanese, food, and, are, not, designed, for, eating, these, chopsticks, allow, handling, of, hot, food, with, one, hand, and, are, used, like, regular, chopsticks, these, chopsticks, have, a, length, of, 30, centimeters, 12, in, or, more, and, may, be, looped, together, with, a, string, at, the, top, they, are, usually, made, from, bamboo, for, deep, frying, however, metal, chopsticks, with, bamboo, handles, are, preferred, as, tips, of, regular, bamboo, chopsticks, become, discolored, and, greasy, after, repeated, use, in, hot, oil, the, bamboo, handles, protect, against, heat, similarly, vietnamese, cooks, use, a, c, or, grand, chopsticks, in, cooking, and, for, serving, rice, from, the, pot, chopsticks, began, to, be, used, as, eating, utensils, during, the, han, dynasty, as, rice, consumption, increased, during, this, period, spoons, continued, to, be, used, alongside, chopsticks, as, eating, utensils, at, meals, it, was, not, until, the, ming, dynasty, that, chopsticks, came, into, exclusive, use, for, both, serving, and, eating, they, then, acquired, the, name, kuaizi, and, the, present, shape, 6, 8, the, use, of, chopsticks, as, both, cooking, and, eating, utensils, spread, throughout, east, and, southeast, asia, over, time, scholars, such, as, isshiki, hachiro, and, lynn, white, have, noted, how, the, world, was, split, among, three, dining, customs, or, food, cultural, spheres, there, are, those, that, eat, with, their, fingers, those, that, use, forks, and, knives, and, then, there, is, the, chopsticks, cultural, sphere, consisting, of, china, japan, korea, and, vietnam, 1, 3, 67, 92, as, han, chinese, emigration, percolated, they, spread, the, usage, of, chopsticks, as, eating, utensils, to, south, and, southeast, asian, countries, including, brunei, cambodia, laos, nepal, malaysia, myanmar, singapore, and, thailand, in, singapore, and, malaysia, the, han, chinese, traditionally, consume, all, food, with, chopsticks, while, ethnic, indians, and, malays, especially, in, singapore, use, chopsticks, primarily, to, consume, noodle, dishes, overall, the, use, of, either, chopsticks, a, spoon, or, a, fork, is, interchangeable, in, these, regions, in, laos, myanmar, thailand, and, nepal, chopsticks, are, generally, used, only, to, consume, noodles, 1, 8, similarly, chopsticks, have, become, more, accepted, in, connection, with, east, asian, cuisine, around, the, world, in, hawaii, the, west, coast, of, north, america, and, cities, with, overseas, asian, communities, all, around, the, globe, the, earliest, european, reference, to, chopsticks, comes, in, the, portuguese, suma, oriental, by, tom, pires, who, wrote, in, 1515, in, malacca, they, eat, with, two, sticks, and, the, earthenware, or, china, bowl, in, their, left, hand, close, to, the, mouth, with, the, two, sticks, to, suck, in, this, is, the, chinese, way, in, ancient, written, chinese, the, character, for, chopsticks, was, zhu, middle, chinese, reconstruction, d, jwo, although, it, may, have, been, widely, used, in, ancient, vernacular, chinese, its, use, was, eventually, replaced, by, the, pronunciation, for, the, character, ku, i, meaning, quick, the, original, character, though, still, used, in, writing, is, rarely, used, in, modern, spoken, mandarin, it, however, is, preserved, in, chinese, languages, such, as, hokkien, and, teochew, as, the, min, chinese, languages, are, directly, descended, from, old, chinese, rather, than, middle, chinese, the, standard, chinese, term, for, chopsticks, is, ku, izi, the, first, character, is, a, pictophonetic, semantic, phonetic, compound, created, with, a, phonetic, part, meaning, quick, and, a, semantic, part, meaning, bamboo, using, the, radical, the, english, word, chopstick, may, have, derived, from, chinese, pidgin, english, in, which, chop, chop, meant, quickly, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, earliest, published, use, of, the, word, is, in, the, 1699, book, voyages, and, descriptions, by, william, dampier, they, are, called, by, the, english, seamen, chopsticks, another, possibility, is, that, the, term, is, derived, from, chow, or, chow, chow, which, is, also, a, pidgin, word, stemming, from, southeast, asia, meaning, food, thus, chopsticks, would, simply, mean, food, sticks, in, tibetan, chopsticks, are, called, kho, ze, in, japanese, chopsticks,

chopsticks, used, by, koreans, are, often, made, of, metal, it, is, believed, that, the, uses, of, metallic, chopsticks, evolved, from, the, royal, practice, of, using, silver, chopsticks, to, detect, poison, in, food, but, the, exact, reason, is, debated, depending, on, the, historical, era, the, metallic, composition, of, korean, chopsticks, varied, in, the, past, such, as, during, the, goryeo, era, chopsticks, were, made, of, bronze, during, the, joseon, era, chopsticks, used, by, royalty, were, made, of, silver, as, its, oxidizing, properties, could, often, be, used, to, detect, whether, or, not, food, intended, for, royals, had, been, tampered, with, in, the, present, day, the, majority, of, korean, metal, chopsticks, are, made, of, stainless, steel, due, to, metal, s, slippery,

typically, bamboo, are, also, common, in, korea, many, korean, chopsticks, are, ornately, decorated, at, the, grip, in, north, and, south, korea, chopsticks, of, medium, length, with, a, small, flat, rectangular, shape, are, paired, with, a, spoon, made, of, the, same, material, the, set, is, called, sujeo, a, portmanteau, of, the, korean, words, for, spoon, and, chopsticks, this, the, historical, extensive, use, of, a, spoon, in, addition, to, chopsticks, is, also, a, feature, unique, to, korea, most, chopstick, using, countries, have, either, eliminated, the, use, of, spoons, or, have, limited, their, use, as, eating, utensils, it, is, traditional, to, rest, sujeo, on, spoon, and, chopstick, rest, so, chopsticks, and, the, spoon, do, not, touch, the, table, surface, in, the, past, materials, for, sujeo, varied, with, social, class, sujeo, used, in, the, court, were, made, with, gold, silver, or, cloisonn, while, commoners, used, brass, or, wooden, sujeo, today, sujeo, is,

with, silver, every, rich, man, kept, the, chopsticks, in, a, sheath, at, the, same, time, sticks, were, not, often, used, directly, for, eating, being, for, the, most, part, an, element, of, decor,

in, malaysia, they, may, be, called, penyepit, lifelong, users, and, adult, learners, alike, around, the, world, hold, chopsticks, in, more, than, one, way, but, there, is, a, general, consensus, on, a, standard, grip, being, the, most, efficient, way, to, grip, and, wield, chopsticks, regardless, of, whether, users, wield, the, standard, grip, or, one, of, many, alternative, grips, their, goals, are, the, same, they, hold, the, two, sticks, in, the, dominant, hand, secured, by, various, fingers, and, parts, of, the, hand, such, that, the, sticks, become, an, extension, of, the, hand, tsung, dao, lee, a, nobel, prize, laureate, in, physics, summarized, it, thus, although, simple, the, two, sticks, perfectly, use, the, physics, of, leverage, chopsticks, are, an, extension, of, human, fingers, whatever, fingers, can, do, chopsticks, can, do, too, 14, alternative, grips, differ, in, their, effectiveness, in, picking, up, food, they, differ, in, the, amount, of, pinching, compression, power, they, can, generate, some, grips, can, generate, substantial, outward, extension, force, while, others, are, unable, to, do, so, the, standard, grip, calls, for, the, top, chopstick, to, be, held, by, the, tip, of, the, thumb, the, tip, of, the, index, finger, and, the, middle, finger, knuckle, these, three, fingers, surround, the, top, stick, from, three, sides, and, firmly, secure, the, stick, as, if, they, were, holding, a, pen, the, three, fingers, using, this, tripod, like, hold, can, wiggle, and, twirl, the, top, stick, as, if, it, were, an, extension, of, them, the, rear, end, of, the, top, stick, rests, on, the, base, of, the, index, finger, the, bottom, chopstick, however, generally, remains, immobile, it, is, secured, by, the, base, of, the, thumb, which, presses, the, stick, against, the, knuckle, of, the, ring, finger, and, against, the, purlicue, the, thumb, therefore, does, double, duty, it, holds, the, bottom, stick, immobile, and, at, the, same, time, it, also, moves, the, top, stick, the, thumb, must, be, flattened, in, order, to, perform, this, double, duty, in, chopstick, using, cultures, learning, to, use, chopsticks, is, part, of, a, child, s, development, process, the, right, way, to, use, chopsticks, is, usually, taught, within, the, family, but, many, young, children, find, their, own, ways, of, wielding, chopsticks, in, the, process, there, exists, a, variety, of, learning, aids, that, parents, purchase, to, help, their, children, learn, to, use, chopsticks, properly, adult, learners, on, the, other, hand, may, acquire, the, skill, through, personal, help, from, friends, or, from, instructions, printed, on, wrapper, sleeves, of, some, disposable, chopsticks, various, video, hosting, platforms, also, provide, a, plethora, of, how, to, videos, on, learning, to, use, chopsticks, all, the, same, adult, learners, too, often, find, their, own, alternative, grips, to, using, chopsticks, in, general, learning, aids, attempt, to, steer, learners, towards, the, established, standard, grip, these, aids, attempt, to, illustrate, or, enforce, the, right, standard, grip, mechanical, leverage, the, learning, process, usually, starts, with, a, proper, initial, placement, of, fingers, per, standard, grip, it, is, crucial, for, learners, to, understand, how, to, hold, both, sticks, firmly, in, the, hand, as, extensions, of, fingers, the, next, step, involves, learning, the, right, motion, of, fingers, in, order, to, move, the, top, stick, from, the, closed, posture, where, tips, of, chopsticks, touch, to, the, open, posture, where, tips, are, extended, wide, apart, for, embracing, food, items, the, open, posture, and, the, closed, posture, define, the, two, ends, of, maximum, standard, grip, motion, in, most, eating, situations, tips, of, chopsticks, need, not, be, extended, this, wide, apart, both, finger, placement, and, standard, grip, motion, rely, on, the, thumb, being, flattened, with, this, flat, thumb, pose, the, base, of, the, thumb, can, exert, enough, force, to, pin, the, bottom, stick, against, the, knuckle, of, the, ring, finger, and, against, the, purlicue, at, the, same, time, the, tip, of, the, thumb, pushes, back, against, the, index, finger, and, the, knuckle, of, the, middle, finger, as, all, three, wield, the, top, stick, in, concert, the, shape, of, the, flat, thumb, is, such, that, the, bottom, stick, is, prevented, from, shaking, loose, and, from, inching, closer, to, the, top, stick, during, repeated, standard, grip, motion, keeping, the, two, chopsticks, separated, far, enough, at, the, place, they, intersect, with, the, thumb, is, important, for, the, standard, grip, at, the, open, posture, it, allows, tips, to, extend, wide, apart, without, rear, ends, of, chopsticks, colliding, at, the, closed, posture, it, enables, better, control, over, tips, of, chopsticks, the, most, popular, chopstick, learning, aid, is, arguably, the, wrapper, sleeve, and, rubber, band, model, which, is, used, in, east, asian, restaurants, around, the, world, these, are, mostly, operated, like, tweezers, or, tongs, while, they, are, useful, for, picking, up, food, they, do, not, help, learners, acquire, the, standard, grip, many, similar, chopstick, inventions, can, be, found, on, the, market, such, as, kwik, stix, some, inventions, combine, other, utensils, with, chopsticks, these, include, the, chork, the, fork, and, knife, chopsticks, etc, some, learning, aids, help, learners, with, the, initial, placement, of, fingers, per, standard, grip, this, can, be, done, by, making, index, finger, thumb, tip, or, equivalent, labels, at, the, right, places, on, chopsticks, often, these, chopsticks, will, have, finger, shaped, grooves, carved, out, of, sticks, to, further, help, learners, find, the, right, placement, other, finger, placement, chopsticks, instead, carve, circumferential, grooves, into, sticks, in, place, of, finger, shaped, ones, some, learning, aids, allow, users, to, wield, two, sticks, as, extensions, of, their, fingers, without, the, exact, finger, dynamics, required, by, the, standard, grip, some, models, provide, hoops, through, which, fingers, can, move, the, top, chopstick, as, an, exoskeleton, of, these, fingers, other, models, use, finger, shaped, tabs, instead, to, achieve, the, same, for, both, top, and, bottom, sticks, yet, other, models, combine, finger, placement, features, with, the, above, usually, these, models, connect, the, two, chopsticks, with, a, bridge, and, a, hinge, holding, the, two, sticks, in, the, right, configuration, on, behalf, of, users, chopsticks, are, used, in, many, parts, of, the, asian, continent, and, principles, of, etiquette, are, similar, but, finer, points, can, differ, from, region, to, region, chopstick, manners, were, gradually, shaped, to, work, with, a, culture, s, particular, dietary, varieties, and, habit, etiquette, developed, for, primarily, individual, servings, eaten, on, the, floor, or, tatami, in, the, case, of, japan, could, be, different, from, communal, meals, eaten, around, a, table, while, seated, on, chairs, the, need, for, serving, or, communal, chopsticks, similarly, differ, in, some, cultures, it, is, customary, to, lift, a, bowl, to, the, mouth, when, the, only, eating, utensil, used, is, chopsticks, in, other, cultures, lifting, a, bowl, closer, to, the, mouth, is, frowned, upon, as, equivalent, to, begging, as, the, local, custom, is, to, use, chopsticks, for, chunky, food, and, a, spoon, for, liquid, food, 102, 119, in, chopstick, using, countries, holding, chopsticks, incorrectly, reflects, negatively, on, a, child, s, parents, and, home, environment, there, are, frequent, news, articles, on, the, alarming, decline, of, children, s, abilities, to, use, chopsticks, correctly, similarly, stabbing, food, due, to, one, s, inability, to, wield, chopsticks, with, dexterity, is, also, frowned, upon, 73, 75, in, general, chopsticks, should, not, be, left, vertically, stuck, into, a, bowl, of, rice, because, it, resembles, the, ritual, of, incense, burning, that, symbolizes, feeding, the, dead, in, cambodia, chopsticks, spoon, and, fork, and, hands, are, the, primary, eating, utensils, although, chopsticks, are, commonly, used, for, noodle, dishes, most, cambodians, use, chopsticks, for, any, meal, and, because, cambodia, adopted, the, spoon, and, fork, later, than, their, neighboring, countries, such, as, thailand, it, is, common, to, see, cambodians, use, chopsticks, for, any, meals, forks, are, only, used, to, help, guide, food, onto, the, spoon, forks, are, not, used, to, shovel, food, into, the, mouth, for, noodle, dishes, such, as, kuyteav, and, num, banhchok, chopsticks, are, used, cambodians, do, not, use, forks, at, all, to, put, food, in, their, mouth, because, they, are, seen, as, dangerous, near, the, mouth, area, and, the, soup, spoon, is, used, for, the, broth, chopsticks, in, malay, speaking, countries, such, as, brunei, indonesia, and, other, parts, of, southeast, asia, are, used, for, eating, noodles, almost, exclusively, whilst, spoon, and,
