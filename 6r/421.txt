the, range, of, targeting, points, in, keeping, with, the, centre, line, theory, the, fighter, can, use, either, the, western, or, thai, stance, which, allows, for, either, long, range, or, short,

sport, there, is, a, distinct, difference, between, a, single, elbow, and, a, follow, up, elbow, the, single, elbow, is, a, move, independent, from, any, other, whereas, a, follow, up, elbow, is, the, second, strike, from, the, same, arm, being, a, hook, or, straight, punch, first, with, an, elbow, follow, up, such, elbows, and, most, other, elbow, strikes, are, used, when, the, distance, between,

must, create, a, wider, base, the, roundhouse, kick, draws, its, power, almost, entirely, from, the, rotational, movement, of, the, hips, counter, rotation, of, the, shoulders, and, arms, are, also, often, used, to, add, torque, to, the, lower, body, and, increase, the, power, of, the, kick, as, well, if, a, roundhouse, kick, is, attempted, by, the, opponent, the, thai, boxer, will, normally, check, the, kick, that, is, he, will, block, the, kick, with, the, outside, of, his, lower, leg, thai, boxers, are, trained, to, always, connect, with, the, shin, the, foot, contains, many, fine,

as, pads, or, heavy, bags, the, foot, thrust, or, literally, foot, jab, is, one, of, the, techniques, in, muay, thai, it, is, mainly, used, as, a, defensive, technique, to, control, distance, or, block, attacks, foot, thrusts, should, be, thrown, quickly, but, with, enough, force, to, knock, an, opponent, off, balance, in, western, boxing, the, two, fighters, are, separated, when, they, clinch, in, muay, thai, however, they, are, not, it, is, often, in, the, clinch, that, knee, and, elbow, techniques, are, used, to, strike, and, bind, the, opponent, for, both, offensive, and, defensive, purposes, small, amounts, of, stand, up, grappling, are, used, in, the, clinch, the, front, clinch, should, be, performed, with, the, palm, of, one, hand, on, the, back, of, the, other,

arms, should, be, putting, as, much, pressure, on, the, neck, as, possible, 3, a, fighter, may, incur, an, injury, to, one, or, more, fingers, if, they, are, intertwined, and, it, becomes, more, difficult, to, release, the, grip, in, order, to, quickly, elbow, the, opponent, s, head, a, correct, clinch, also, involves, the, fighter, s, forearms, pressing, against, the, opponent, s, collar, bone, while, the, hands, are, around, the, opponent, s, head, rather, than, the, opponent, s, neck, the, general, way, to, get, out, of, a, clinch, is, to, push, the, opponent, s, head, backward, or, elbow, them, as, the, clinch, requires, both, participants, to, be, very, close, to, one, another, additionally, the, non, dominant, clincher, can, try, to, swim, their, arm, underneath, and, inside, the, opponent, s, clinch, establishing, the, previously, non, dominant, clincher, as, the, dominant, clincher, muay, thai, has, several, other, variants, of, the, clinch, or, chap, kho, including, defences, in, muay, thai, are, categorised, in, six, groups, defensively, the, concept, of, wall, of, defence, is, used, in, which, shoulders, arms, and, legs, are, used, to, hinder, the, attacker, from, successfully, executing, techniques, blocking, is, a, critical, element, in, muay, thai, and, compounds, the, level, of, conditioning, a, successful, practitioner, must, possess, low, and, mid, body, roundhouse, kicks, are, normally, blocked, with, the, upper, portion, of, a, raised, shin, this, block, is, known, as, a, check, high, body, strikes, are, blocked, ideally, with, the, forearms, and, shoulder, together, or, if, enough, time, is, allowed, for, a, parry, the, glove, elusively, elbow, or, shin, will, be, used, midsection, roundhouse, kicks, can, also, be, caught, trapped, allowing, for, a, sweep, or, counter, attack, to, the, remaining, leg, of, the, opponent, punches, are, blocked, with, an, ordinary, boxing, guard, and, techniques, similar, if, not, identical, to, basic, boxing, technique, a, common, means, of, blocking, a, punch, is, using, the, hand, on, the, same, side, as, the, oncoming, punch, for, example, if, an, orthodox, fighter, throws, a, jab, being, the, left, hand, the, defender, will, make, a, slight, tap, to, redirect, the, punch, s, angle, with, the, right, hand, the, deflection, is, always, as, small, and, precise, as, possible, to, avoid, unnecessary, energy, expenditure, and, return, the, hand, to, the, guard, as, quickly, as, possible, hooks, are, often, blocked, with, a, motion, sometimes, described, as, combing, the, hair, that, is, raising, the, elbow, forward, and, effectively, shielding, the, head, with, the, forearm, flexed, biceps, and, shoulder, more, advanced, muay, thai, blocks, are, usually, in, the, form, of, counter, strikes, using, the, opponent, s, weight, as, they, strike, to, amplify, the, damage, that, the, countering, opponent, can, deliver, this, requires, impeccable, timing, and, thus, can,

requires, the, athlete, to, rest, for, more, than, one, day, many, injuries, in, the, sport, go, unreported, as, the, fighters, may, not, notice, the, injuries, at, first, refuse, to, admit, that, they, need, treatment, have, a, heightened, pain, threshold, fear, that, their, instructor, will, perceive, the, injury, negatively, or, have, confusion, as, to, what, is, an, injury, similar, to,

metacarpals, digits, and, ribs, the, distribution, of, injuries, differs, significantly, for, beginners, amateurs, and, professionals, because, as, a, fighter, progresses, through, the, different, levels, the, forces, involved, grow, progressively, higher, less, padding, and, protective, equipment, is, used, and, athletes, are, likely, to, train, harder, resulting, in, more, serious, injuries,

to, the, attacks, of, the, pad, holder, in, a, live, situation, the, trainer, will, often, also, wear, a, belly, pad, around, the, abdominal, area, so, that, the, fighter, can, attack, with, straight,
