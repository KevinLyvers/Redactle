a, nuclear, family, also, known, as, an, elementary, family, atomic, family, cereal, packet, family, or, conjugal, family, is, a, family, group, consisting, of, parents, and, their, children, one, or, more, typically, living, in, one, home, residence, it, is, in, contrast, to, a, single, parent, family, a, larger, extended, family, or, a, family, with, more, than, two, parents, nuclear, families, typically, center, on, a, married, couple, which, may, have, any, number, of, children, there, are, differences, in, definition, among, observers, some, definitions, allow, only, biological, children, who, are, full, blood, siblings, and, consider, adopted, or, half, and, step, siblings, a, part, of, the, immediate, family, but, others, allow, for, a, step, parent, and, any, mix, of, dependent, children, including, stepchildren, and, adopted, children, some, sociologists, and, anthropologists, consider, the, extended, family, structure, to, be, the, most, common, family, structure, in, most, cultures, and, at, most, times, rather, than, the, nuclear, family, the, term, nuclear, family, was, popularized, in, the, 20th, century, since, that, time, the, number, of, north, american, nuclear, families, is, gradually, decreasing, while, the, number, of, alternative, family, formations, has, increased, the, term, nuclear, family, first, appeared, in, the, early, 20th, century, merriam, webster, dates, the, term, back, to, 1924, while, the, oxford, english, dictionary, has, a, reference, to, the, term, from, 1925, thus, it, is, relatively, new, the, phrase, is, taken, from, the, general, use, of, the, noun, nucleus, itself, originating, in, the, latin, nux, meaning, nut, i, e, the, core, of, something, in, its, most, common, usage, the, term, nuclear, family, refers, to, a, household, consisting, of, a, father, a, mother, and, their, children, all, in, one, household, dwelling, george, murdock, an, observer, of, families, offered, an, early, description, the, family, is, a, social, group, characterized, by, common, residence, economic, cooperation, and, reproduction, it, contains, adults, of, both, sexes, at, least, two, of, whom, maintain, a, socially, approved, relationship, and, one, or, more, children, own, or, adopted, of, the, sexually, cohabiting, adults, many, individuals, are, part, of, two, nuclear, families, in, their, lives, the, family, of, origin, in, which, they, are, offspring, and, the, family, of, procreation, in, which, they, are, a, parent, alternative, definitions, have, evolved, to, include, family, units, with, same, sex, parents, adoption, and, perhaps, additional, adult, relatives, who, take, on, a, cohabiting, parental, role, dna, extracted, from, bones, and, teeth, discovered, at, a, 4, 600, year, old, stone, age, burial, site, in, germany, has, provided, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, social, recognition, of, a, family, consisting, of, two, parents, with, multiple, children, historians, alan, macfarlane, and, peter, laslett, among, other, european, researchers, say, that, nuclear, families, have, been, a, primary, arrangement, in, england, since, the, 13th, century, this, primary, arrangement, was, different, from, the, normal, arrangements, in, southern, europe, in, parts, of, asia, and, the, middle, east, where, it, was, common, for, young, adults, to, remain, in, or, marry, into, the, family, home, in, england, multi, generational, households, were, uncommon, because, young, adults, would, save, enough, money, to, move, out, into, their, own, household, once, they, married, sociologist, brigitte, berger, argued, the, young, nuclear, family, had, to, be, flexible, and, mobile, as, it, searched, for, opportunity, and, property, forced, to, rely, on, their, own, ingenuity, its, members, also, needed, to, plan, for, the, future, and, develop, bourgeois, habits, of, work, and, saving, berger, also, mentions, that, this, could, be, one, of, the, reasons, that, the, industrial, revolution, began, in, england, and, other, northwest, european, countries, however, the, historicity, of, the, nuclear, family, in, england, has, been, challenged, by, cord, oestmann, family, structures, of, a, married, couple, and, their, children, were, present, in, western, europe, and, new, england, in, the, 17th, century, influenced, by, church, and, theocratic, governments, with, the, emergence, of, proto, industrialization, and, early, capitalism, the, nuclear, family, became, a, financially, viable, social, unit, an, extended, group, consists, of, non, nuclear, or, non, immediate, family, members, considered, together, with, nuclear, or, immediate, family, members, when, extended, family, is, involved, they, also, influence, children, s, development, just, as, much, as, the, parents, would, on, their, own, in, an, extended, family, resources, are, usually, shared, among, those, involved, adding, more, of, a, community, aspect, to, the, family, unit, this, is, not, limited, to, the, sharing, of, objects, and, money, but, includes, sharing, time, for, example, extended, family, members, such, as, grandparents, are, able, to, watch, over, grandchildren, allowing, parents, to, continue, and, pursue, careers, and, allows, the, parents, to, reduce, stress, levels, extended, families, also, contribute, to, children, s, mental, health, due, to, increased, resources, in, terms, of, adult, support, in, 2005, information, from, the, united, states, census, bureau, showed, that, 70, of, children, in, the, us, live, in, two, parent, families, with, 66, of, those, living, with, parents, who, were, married, and, 60, living, with, their, biological, parents, furthermore, the, figures, suggest, that, the, tumultuous, shifts, in, family, structure, since, the, late, 1960s, have, leveled, off, since, 1990, the, pew, research, center, s, analysis, of, data, from, the, american, community, survey, and, the, decennial, census, revealed, that, the, number, of, children, living, outside, of, the, traditional, ideal, of, parents, marrying, young, and, staying, together, till, death, has, risen, precipitously, between, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, and, the, early, 21st, century, in, 2013, only, 43, of, children, lived, with, married, parents, in, their, first, marriage, down, from, 73, in, 1960, meanwhile, the, share, of, children, living, with, a, single, parent, was, 34, in, 2013, up, from, 9, in, 1960, when, considered, separately, from, couples, without, children, single, parent, families, and, unmarried, couples, with, children, the, united, states, nuclear, families, appear, to, constitute, a, minority, of, households, with, a, rising, prevalence, of, other, family, arrangements, in, 2000, nuclear, families, with, the, original, biological, parents, constituted, roughly, 24, 10, of, american, households, compared, with, 40, 30, in, 1970, roughly, two, thirds, of, all, children, in, the, united, states, will, spend, at, least, some, time, in, a, single, parent, household, according, to, some, sociologists, no, longer, seems, adequate, to, cover, the, wide, diversity, of, household, arrangements, we, see, today, edwards, 1991, stacey, 1996, a, new, term, has, been, introduced, postmodern, family, intended, to, describe, the, great, variability, in, family, forms, including, single, parent, families, and, couples, without, children, nuclear, family, households, are, now, less, common, compared, to, household, with, couples, without, children, single, parent, families, and, unmarried, couples, with, children, in, the, uk, the, number, of, nuclear, families, fell, from, 39, 0, of, all, households, in, 1968, to, 28, 0, in, 1992, the, decrease, accompanied, an, equivalent, increase, in, the, number, of, single, parent, households, and, in, the, number, of, adults, living, alone, professor, wolfgang, haak, of, adelaide, university, detects, traces, of, the, nuclear, family, in, prehistoric, central, europe, a, 2005, archeological, dig, in, elau, in, germany, analyzed, by, haak, revealed, genetic, evidence, suggesting, that, the, 13, individuals, found, in, a, grave, were, closely, related, haak, said, by, establishing, the, genetic, links, between, the, two, adults, and, two, children, buried, together, in, one, grave, we, have, established, the, presence, of, the, classic, nuclear, family, in, a, prehistoric, context, in, central, europe, their, unity, in, death, suggest, a, unity, in, life, this, paper, does, not, regard, the, nuclear, family, as, natural, or, as, the, only, model, for, human, family, life, this, does, not, establish, the, elemental, family, to, be, a, universal, model, or, the, most, ancient, institution, of, human, communities, for, example, polygamous, unions, are, prevalent, in, ethnographic, data, and, models, of, household, communities, have, apparently, been, involving, a, high, degree, of, complexity, from, their, origins, lastly, large, shifts, in, the, financial, landscape, for, families, has, made, the, historically, middle, class, traditional, nuclear, family, structure, significantly, more, risky, expensive, and, unstable, the, expenses, associated, with, raising, a, family, notably, housing, medical, care, and, education, have, all, increased, very, rapidly, particularly, since, the, 1950s, since, then, middle, class, incomes, have, stagnated, or, even, declined, whilst, living, costs, have, soared, to, the, point, where, even, two, income, households, are, now, unable, to, offer, the, same, level, of, financial, stability, that, was, once, possible, under, the, single, income, nuclear, family, household, of, the, 1950s, as, a, fertility, factor, single, nuclear, family, households, generally, have, a, higher, number, of, children, than, co, operative, living, arrangements, according, to, studies, from, both, the, western, world, and, india, there, have, been, studies, done, that, shows, a, difference, in, the, number, of, children, wanted, per, household, according, to, where, they, live, families, that, live, in, rural, areas, wanted, to, have, more, kids, than, families, in, urban, areas, a, study, done, in, japan, between, october, 2011, and, february, 2012, further, researched, the, effect, of, area, of, residence, on, mean, desired, number, of, children, researchers, of, the, study, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, women, living, in, rural, areas, with, larger, families, were, more, likely, to, want, more, children, compared, to, women, that, lived, in, urban, areas, in, japan, for, social, conservatism, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, idea, that, the, nuclear, family, is, traditional, is, a, very, important, aspect, where, family, is, seen, as, the, primary, unit, of, society, these, movements, oppose, alternative, family, forms, and, social, institutions, that, are, seen, by, them, to, undermine, parental, authority, the, number, of, nuclear, families, is, slowly, dwindling, in, the, us, as, more, women, pursue, higher, education, develop, professional, lives, and, delay, having, children, until, later, in, their, life, children, and, marriage, have, become, less, appealing, as, many, women, continue, to, face, societal, familial, and, or, peer, pressure, to, give, up, their, education, and, career, to, focus, on, stabilizing, the, home, as, ethnic, and, cultural, diversity, continues, to, grow, in, the, united, states, it, has, become, more, difficult, for, the, traditional, nuclear, family, to, remain, the, norm, data, from, 2014, also, suggests, that, single, parents, and, the, likelihood, of, children, living, with, one, is, correlated, with, race, the, pew, research, center, projected, that, 54, of, african, americans, will, be, single, parents, compared, to, only, 19, of, european, americans, several, factors, account, for, the, differences, in, family, structure, including, economic, and, social, class, differences, in, education, level, also, change, the, amount, of, single, parents, in, 2014, those, with, less, than, a, high, school, education, are, 46, more, likely, to, be, a, single, parent, compared, to, 12, who, have, graduated, from, college, critics, of, the, term, traditional, family, point, out, that, in, most, cultures, and, at, most, times, the, extended, family, model, has, been, most, common, not, the, nuclear, family, though, the, nuclear, family, has, had, a, longer, tradition, in, england, than, in, other, parts, of, europe, and, asia, which, contributed, large, numbers, of, immigrants, to, the, americas, the, nuclear, family, became, the, most, common, form, in, the, u, s, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, concept, that, narrowly, defines, a, nuclear, family, as, central, to, stability, in, modern, society, that, has, been, promoted, by, familialists, who, are, social, conservatives, in, the, united, states, and, has, been, challenged, as, historically, and, sociologically, inadequate, to, describe, the, complexity, of, actual, family, relations, in, freudian, theories, of, identification, and, their, derivatives, urie, bronfenbrenner, states, very, little, is, known, about, the, extent, variation, in, the, behavior, of, fathers, and, mothers, towards, sons, and, daughters, and, even, less, about, the, possible, effects, on, such, differential, treatment, little, is, known, about, how, parental, behavior, and, identification, processes, work, and, how, children, interpret, sex, role, learning, in, his, theory, he, uses, identification, with, the, father, in, the, sense, that, the, son, will, follow, the, sex, role, provided, by, his, father, and, then, for, the, father, to, be, able, to, identify, the, difference, of, the, cross, sex, parent, for, his, daughter
