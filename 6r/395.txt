the, shot, put, is, a, track, and, field, event, involving, putting, throwing, a, heavy, spherical, ball, the, shot, as, far, as, possible, for, men, the, sport, has, been, a, part, of, the, modern, olympics, since, their, revival, 1896, and, women, s, competition, began, in, 1948, homer, mentions, competitions, of, rock, throwing, by, soldiers, during, the, siege, of, troy, but, there, is, no, record, of, any, weights, being, thrown, in, greek, competitions, the, first, evidence, for, stone, or, weight, throwing, events, were, in, the, scottish, highlands, and, date, back, to, approximately, the, first, century, in, the, 16th, century, king, henry, viii, was, noted, for, his, prowess, in, court, competitions, of, weight, and, hammer, throwing, the, first, events, resembling, the, modern, shot, put, likely, occurred, in, the, middle, ages, when, soldiers, held, competitions, in, which, they, hurled, cannonballs, shot, put, competitions, were, first, recorded, in, early, 19th, century, scotland, and, were, a, part, of, the, british, amateur, championships, beginning, in, 1866, competitors, take, their, throw, from, inside, a, marked, circle, 2, 135, metres, 7, ft, 0, in, in, diameter, with, a, toe, board, or, stop, board, 10, centimetres, 4, in, high, at, the, front, of, the, circle, the, distance, thrown, is, measured, from, the, inside, of, the, circumference, of, the, circle, to, the, nearest, mark, made, on, the, ground, by, the, falling, shot, with, distances, rounded, down, to, the, nearest, centimetre, under, iaaf, and, wma, rules, the, following, rules, indoor, and, outdoor, must, be, adhered, to, for, a, legal, throw, foul, throws, occur, when, an, athlete, at, any, time, if, the, shot, loses, contact, with, the, neck, then, it, is, technically, an, illegal, put, the, following, are, either, obsolete, or, non, existent, but, commonly, believed, rules, for, professional, competition, shot, put, competitions, have, been, held, at, the, modern, summer, olympic, games, since, their, inception, in, 1896, and, it, is, also, included, as, an, event, in, the, world, athletics, championships, each, of, these, competitions, in, the, modern, era, have, a, set, number, of, rounds, of, throws, typically, there, are, three, qualification, rounds, to, determine, qualification, for, the, final, there, are, then, three, preliminary, rounds, in, the, final, with, the, top, eight, competitors, receiving, a, further, three, throws, each, competitor, in, the, final, is, credited, with, their, longest, throw, regardless, of, whether, it, was, achieved, in, the, preliminary, or, final, three, rounds, the, competitor, with, the, longest, legal, put, is, declared, the, winner, in, open, competitions, the, men, s, shot, weighs, 7, 26, kilograms, 16, lb, and, the, women, s, shot, weighs, 4, kilograms, 8, 82, lb, junior, school, and, masters, competitions, often, use, different, weights, of, shots, typically, below, the, weights, of, those, used, in, open, competitions, the, individual, rules, for, each, competition, should, be, consulted, in, order, to, determine, the, correct, weights, to, be, used, two, putting, styles, are, in, current, general, use, by, shot, put, competitors, the, glide, and, the, spin, with, all, putting, styles, the, goal, is, to, release, the, shot, with, maximum, forward, velocity, at, an, angle, of, slightly, less, than, forty, five, degrees, the, origin, of, this, technique, dates, to, 1951, when, parry, o, brien, from, the, united, states, invented, a, technique, that, involved, the, putter, facing, backwards, rotating, 180, degrees, across, the, circle, and, then, tossing, the, shot, unlike, spin, this, technique, is, a, linear, movement, with, this, technique, a, right, hand, thrower, would, begin, facing, the, rear, of, the, circle, they, would, typically, adopt, a, specific, type, of, crouch, involving, their, bent, right, leg, in, order, to, begin, the, throw, from, a, more, beneficial, posture, whilst, also, isometrically, preloading, their, muscles, the, positioning, of, their, bodyweight, over, their, bent, leg, which, pushes, upwards, with, equal, force, generates, a, preparatory, isometric, press, the, force, generated, by, this, press, will, be, channelled, into, the, subsequent, throw, making, it, more, powerful, to, initiate, the, throw, they, kick, to, the, front, with, the, left, leg, while, pushing, off, forcefully, with, the, right, as, the, thrower, crosses, the, circle, the, hips, twist, toward, the, front, the, left, arm, is, swung, out, then, pulled, back, tight, followed, by, the, shoulders, and, they, then, strike, in, a, putting, motion, with, their, right, arm, the, key, is, to, move, quickly, across, the, circle, with, as, little, air, under, the, feet, as, possible, hence, the, name, glide, this, is, also, known, as, the, rotational, technique, it, was, first, practiced, in, europe, in, the, 1950s, but, did, not, receive, much, attention, until, the, 1970s, in, 1972, aleksandr, baryshnikov, set, his, first, ussr, record, using, a, new, putting, style, the, spin, in, russian, invented, by, his, coach, viktor, alexeyev, the, spin, involves, rotating, like, a, discus, thrower, and, using, rotational, momentum, for, power, in, 1976, baryshnikov, went, on, to, set, a, world, record, of, 22, 00, m, 72, 18, ft, with, his, spin, style, and, was, the, first, shot, putter, to, cross, the, 22, meter, mark, with, this, technique, a, right, hand, thrower, faces, the, rear, and, begins, to, spin, on, the, ball, of, the, left, foot, the, thrower, comes, around, and, faces, the, front, of, the, circle, and, drives, the, right, foot, into, the, center, of, the, circle, finally, the, thrower, reaches, for, the, front, of, the, circle, with, the, left, foot, twisting, the, hips, and, shoulders, like, in, the, glide, and, puts, the, shot, when, the, athlete, executes, the, spin, the, upper, body, is, twisted, hard, to, the, right, so, the, imaginary, lines, created, by, the, shoulders, and, hips, are, no, longer, parallel, this, action, builds, up, torque, and, stretches, the, muscles, creating, an, involuntary, elasticity, in, the, muscles, providing, extra, power, and, momentum, when, the, athlete, prepares, to, release, the, left, foot, is, firmly, planted, causing, the, momentum, and, energy, generated, to, be, conserved, pushing, the, shot, in, an, upward, and, outward, direction, another, purpose, of, the, spin, is, to, build, up, a, high, rotational, speed, by, swinging, the, right, leg, initially, then, to, bring, all, the, limbs, in, tightly, similar, to, a, figure, skater, bringing, in, their, arms, while, spinning, to, increase, their, speed, once, this, fast, speed, is, achieved, the, shot, is, released, transferring, the, energy, into, the, shot, put, until, 2016, a, woman, had, never, made, an, olympic, final, top, 8, using, the, spin, technique, the, first, woman, to, enter, a, final, and, win, a, medal, at, the, olympics, was, anita, m, rton, ryan, crouser, the, current, men, s, world, record, holder, added, an, additional, move, the, crouser, slide, to, his, spin, technique, he, used, this, technique, to, set, the, world, record, at, the, los, angeles, grand, prix, in, 2023, currently, most, top, male, shot, putters, use, the, spin, however, the, glide, remains, popular, since, the, technique, leads, to, greater, consistency, compared, to, the, rotational, technique, almost, all, throwers, start, by, using, the, glide, tomasz, majewski, notes, that, although, most, athletes, use, the, spin, he, and, some, other, top, shot, putters, achieved, success, using, this, classic, method, for, example, he, became, the, first, to, defend, the, olympic, title, in, 56, years, the, world, record, and, the, next, six, best, male, results, 23, 37, 23, 30, 23, 15, and, 23, 12, by, ryan, crouser, 23, 23, by, joe, kovacs, and, 23, 12, and, 23, 10, by, randy, barnes, were, completed, with, the, spin, technique, while, the, eighth, best, all, time, put, of, 23, 06, m, 75, ft, 7, 3, 4, in, by, ulf, timmermann, was, completed, with, the, glide, technique, the, decision, to, glide, or, spin, may, need, to, be, decided, on, an, individual, basis, determined, by, the, thrower, s, size, and, power, short, throwers, may, benefit, from, the, spin, and, taller, throwers, may, benefit, from, the, glide, but, many, throwers, do, not, follow, this, guideline, the, shot, is, made, of, different, kinds, of, materials, depending, on, its, intended, use, materials, used, include, sand, iron, cast, iron, solid, steel, stainless, steel, brass, and, synthetic, materials, like, polyvinyl, some, metals, are, more, dense, than, others, making, the, size, of, the, shot, vary, for, example, different, materials, are, used, to, make, indoor, and, outdoor, shot, because, damage, to, surroundings, must, be, taken, into, account, so, the, latter, are, smaller, there, are, various, size, and, weight, standards, for, the, implement, that, depend, on, the, age, and, gender, of, the, competitors, as, well, as, the, national, customs, of, the, governing, body, the, current, world, record, holders, are, the, current, records, held, on, each, continent, are, tables, show, data, for, two, definitions, of, top, 25, the, top, 25, distances, and, the, top, 25, athletes, light, yellow, denotes, top, performance, for, athletes, in, the, top, 25, distances, white, denotes, lesser, performances, still, in, the, top, 25, distances, by, repeat, athletes, green, denotes, top, performance, only, for, other, top, 25, athletes, who, fall, outside, the, top, 25, distances, below, is, a, list, of, all, other, throws, equal, or, superior, to, 22, 42, m, ryan, crouser, threw, 23, 38, i, a, possible, world, record, in, pocatello, idaho, on, 18, february, 2023, but, this, result, was, unratifiable, because, the, throwing, circle, was, too, wide, and, raised, above, ground, level, the, following, athletes, had, their, performance, inside, 21, 50, m, annulled, due, to, doping, offences
