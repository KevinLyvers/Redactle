listed, as, japanese, but, particularly, since, the, 1960s, a, number, of, high, profile, foreign, born, wrestlers, became, well, known, and, in, more, recent, years, have, even, come, to, dominate, in, the, highest, ranks, in, the, 10, years, since, january, 2009, five, of, the, nine, wrestlers, promoted, to, zeki, have, been, foreign, born, and, a, japanese, had, not, been, named, yokozuna, from, 1998, until, the, promotion, of, kisenosato, yutaka, in, 2017, this, and, other, issues, eventually, led, the, sumo, association, to, limit, the, number, of, foreigners, allowed, to, one, in, each, stable, women, are, not, allowed, to, compete, in, professional, sumo, they, are, also, not, allowed, to, enter, the, wrestling, ring, dohy, a, tradition, stemming, from, shinto, and, buddhist,

matched, up, with, each, other, and, the, last, matchups, often, involve, undefeated, wrestlers, competing, against, each, other, even, if, they, are, from, opposite, ends, of, the, division, in, the, top, division, in, the, last, few, days, wrestlers, with, exceptional, records, often, have, matches, against, much, more, highly, ranked, opponents, including, san, yaku, wrestlers, especially, if, they, are, still, in, the, running, for, the, top, division, championship, similarly, more, highly, ranked, wrestlers, with, very, poor, records, may, find, themselves, fighting, wrestlers, much, further, down, the, division, for, the, yokozuna, and, zeki, the, first, week, and, a, half, of, the, tournament, tends, to, be, taken, up, with, bouts, against, the, top, maegashira, komusubi, and, sekiwake, with, the, bouts, within, these, ranks, being, concentrated, into, the, last, five, days, or, so, of, the, tournament, depending, on, the, number, of, top, ranked, wrestlers, competing,

regimented, way, of, life, the, sumo, association, prescribes, the, behavior, of, its, wrestlers, in, some, detail, for, example, the, association, prohibits, wrestlers, from, driving, cars, although, this, is, partly, out, of, necessity, as, many, wrestlers, are, too, big, to, fit, behind, a, steering, wheel, breaking, the, rules, can, result, in, fines, and, or, suspension, for, both, the, offending, wrestler, and, his, stablemaster, on, entering, sumo, they, are, expected, to, grow, their, hair, long, to, form, a, topknot, or, chonmage, similar, to, the, samurai, hairstyles, of, the,

and, quality, of, the, dress, depends, on, the, wrestler, s, rank, rikishi, in, jonidan, and, below, are, allowed, to, wear, only, a, thin, cotton, robe, called, a, yukata, even, in, winter, furthermore, when, outside, they, must, wear, a, form, of, wooden, sandal, called, geta, wrestlers, in, the, makushita, and, sandanme, divisions, can, wear, a, form, of, traditional, short, overcoat, over, their, yukata, and, are, allowed, to, wear, straw, sandals, called, z, ri, the, higher, ranked, sekitori, can, wear, silk, robes, of, their, own, choice, and, the, quality, of, the, garb, is,

wrestlers, may, have, chores, to, do, such, as, assisting, in, cooking, lunch, cleaning, and, preparing, baths, holding, a, sekitori, s, towel, or, wiping, the, sweat, from, him, the, ranking, hierarchy, is, preserved, for, the, order, of, precedence, in, bathing, after, training, and, in, eating, lunch, wrestlers, are, not, normally, allowed, to, eat, breakfast, and, are, expected, to, have, a, siesta, like, nap, after, a, large, lunch, the, most, common, type, of, lunch, served, is, the, traditional, sumo, meal, of, chankonabe, which, consists, of, a, simmering, stew, of, various, meat, and, vegetables, cooked, at, the, table, and, usually, eaten, with, rice, this, regimen, of, no, breakfast, and, a, large, lunch, followed, by, a, sleep, is, intended, to, help, wrestlers, put, on, a, lot, of, weight, so, as, to, compete, more, effectively, sumo, wrestlers, also, drink, large, amounts, of, beer, in, the, afternoon, the, junior, wrestlers, again, usually, have, cleaning, or, other, chores, while, their, sekitori, counterparts, may, relax, or, deal, with, work, issues, related, to, their, fan, clubs, younger, wrestlers, also, attend, classes, although, their, education, differs, from, the, typical, curriculum, of, their, non, sumo, peers, in, the, evening, sekitori, may, go, out, with, their, sponsors, while, the, junior, wrestlers, generally, stay, at, home, in, the, stable, unless, they, are, to, accompany, the, stablemaster, or, a, sekitori, as, his, tsukebito, manservant, when, he, is, out, becoming, a, tsukebito, for, a, senior, member, of, the, stable, is, a, typical, duty, a, sekitori, has, a, number, of, tsukebito, depending, on, the, size, of, the, stable, or, in, some, cases, depending, on, the, size, of, the, sekitori, the, junior, wrestlers,

prone, to, heart, attacks, due, to, the, enormous, amount, of, body, mass, and, fat, that, they, accumulate, the, excessive, intake, of, alcohol, can, lead, to, liver, problems, and, the, stress, on, their, joints, due, to, their, excess, weight, can, cause, arthritis, the, repeated, blows, to, the, head, sumo, wrestlers, take, can, also, cause, long, term, cognitive, issues, similar, to, those, seen, in, boxers, in, the, 21st, century, the, standards, of, weight, gain, became, less, strict, to, try, and, increase, the, health, of, the, wrestlers, as, of, 2018, the, monthly, salary, figures,

money, called, kensh, kin, for, bouts, involving, yokozuna, and, zeki, the, number, of, sponsors, can, be, quite, large, whereas, for, lower, ranked, matchups, no, bout, sponsors, may, be, active, at,
