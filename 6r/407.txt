scuba, diving, is, a, mode, of, underwater, diving, whereby, divers, use, breathing, equipment, that, is, completely, independent, of, a, surface, breathing, gas, supply, and, therefore, has, a, limited, but, variable, endurance, the, name, scuba, is, an, anacronym, for, self, contained, underwater, breathing, apparatus, and, was, coined, by, christian, j, lambertsen, in, a, patent, submitted, in, 1952, scuba, divers, carry, their, own, source, of, breathing, gas, usually, compressed, air, affording, them, greater, independence, and, movement, than, surface, supplied, divers, and, more, time, underwater, than, free, divers, although, the, use, of, compressed, air, is, common, a, gas, blend, with, a, higher, oxygen, content, known, as, enriched, air, or, nitrox, has, become, popular, due, to, the, reduced, nitrogen, intake, during, long, or, repetitive, dives, also, breathing, gas, diluted, with, helium, may, be, used, to, reduce, the, effects, of, nitrogen, narcosis, during, deeper, dives, open, circuit, scuba, systems, discharge, the, breathing, gas, into, the, environment, as, it, is, exhaled, and, consist, of, one, or, more, diving, cylinders, containing, breathing, gas, at, high, pressure, which, is, supplied, to, the, diver, at, ambient, pressure, through, a, diving, regulator, they, may, include, additional, cylinders, for, range, extension, decompression, gas, or, emergency, breathing, gas, closed, circuit, or, semi, closed, circuit, rebreather, scuba, systems, allow, recycling, of, exhaled, gases, the, volume, of, gas, used, is, reduced, compared, to, that, of, open, circuit, so, a, smaller, cylinder, or, cylinders, may, be, used, for, an, equivalent, dive, duration, rebreathers, extend, the, time, spent, underwater, compared, to, open, circuit, for, the, same, metabolic, gas, consumption, they, produce, fewer, bubbles, and, less, noise, than, open, circuit, scuba, which, makes, them, attractive, to, covert, military, divers, to, avoid, detection, scientific, divers, to, avoid, disturbing, marine, animals, and, media, divers, to, avoid, bubble, interference, scuba, diving, may, be, done, recreationally, or, professionally, in, a, number, of, applications, including, scientific, military, and, public, safety, roles, but, most, commercial, diving, uses, surface, supplied, diving, equipment, when, this, is, practicable, scuba, divers, engaged, in, armed, forces, covert, operations, may, be, referred, to, as, frogmen, combat, divers, or, attack, swimmers, a, scuba, diver, primarily, moves, underwater, by, using, fins, attached, to, the, feet, but, external, propulsion, can, be, provided, by, a, diver, propulsion, vehicle, or, a, sled, pulled, from, the, surface, other, equipment, needed, for, scuba, diving, includes, a, mask, to, improve, underwater, vision, exposure, protection, by, means, of, a, diving, suit, ballast, weights, to, overcome, excess, buoyancy, equipment, to, control, buoyancy, and, equipment, related, to, the, specific, circumstances, and, purpose, of, the, dive, which, may, include, a, snorkel, when, swimming, on, the, surface, a, cutting, tool, to, manage, entanglement, lights, a, dive, computer, to, monitor, decompression, status, and, signalling, devices, scuba, divers, are, trained, in, the, procedures, and, skills, appropriate, to, their, level, of, certification, by, diving, instructors, affiliated, to, the, diver, certification, organisations, which, issue, these, certifications, these, include, standard, operating, procedures, for, using, the, equipment, and, dealing, with, the, general, hazards, of, the, underwater, environment, and, emergency, procedures, for, self, help, and, assistance, of, a, similarly, equipped, diver, experiencing, problems, a, minimum, level, of, fitness, and, health, is, required, by, most, training, organisations, but, a, higher, level, of, fitness, may, be, appropriate, for, some, applications, the, history, of, scuba, diving, is, closely, linked, with, the, history, of, scuba, equipment, by, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, two, basic, architectures, for, underwater, breathing, apparatus, had, been, pioneered, open, circuit, surface, supplied, equipment, where, the, diver, s, exhaled, gas, is, vented, directly, into, the, water, and, closed, circuit, breathing, apparatus, where, the, diver, s, carbon, dioxide, is, filtered, from, exhaled, unused, oxygen, which, is, then, recirculated, and, oxygen, added, to, make, up, the, volume, when, necessary, closed, circuit, equipment, was, more, easily, adapted, to, scuba, in, the, absence, of, reliable, portable, and, economical, high, pressure, gas, storage, vessels, by, the, mid, twentieth, century, high, pressure, gas, cylinders, were, available, and, two, systems, for, scuba, had, emerged, open, circuit, scuba, where, the, diver, s, exhaled, breath, is, vented, directly, into, the, water, and, closed, circuit, scuba, where, the, carbon, dioxide, is, removed, from, the, diver, s, exhaled, breath, which, has, oxygen, added, and, is, recirculated, oxygen, rebreathers, are, severely, depth, limited, due, to, oxygen, toxicity, risk, which, increases, with, depth, and, the, available, systems, for, mixed, gas, rebreathers, were, fairly, bulky, and, designed, for, use, with, diving, helmets, the, first, commercially, practical, scuba, rebreather, was, designed, and, built, by, the, diving, engineer, henry, fleuss, in, 1878, while, working, for, siebe, gorman, in, london, his, self, contained, breathing, apparatus, consisted, of, a, rubber, mask, connected, to, a, breathing, bag, with, an, estimated, 50, 60, oxygen, supplied, from, a, copper, tank, and, carbon, dioxide, scrubbed, by, passing, it, through, a, bundle, of, rope, yarn, soaked, in, a, solution, of, caustic, potash, the, system, giving, a, dive, duration, of, up, to, about, three, hours, this, apparatus, had, no, way, of, measuring, the, gas, composition, during, use, during, the, 1930s, and, all, through, world, war, ii, the, british, italians, and, germans, developed, and, extensively, used, oxygen, rebreathers, to, equip, the, first, frogmen, the, british, adapted, the, davis, submerged, escape, apparatus, and, the, germans, adapted, the, dr, ger, submarine, escape, rebreathers, for, their, frogmen, during, the, war, in, the, u, s, major, christian, j, lambertsen, invented, an, underwater, free, swimming, oxygen, rebreather, in, 1939, which, was, accepted, by, the, office, of, strategic, services, in, 1952, he, patented, a, modification, of, his, apparatus, this, time, named, scuba, an, acronym, for, self, contained, underwater, breathing, apparatus, which, became, the, generic, english, word, for, autonomous, breathing, equipment, for, diving, and, later, for, the, activity, using, the, equipment, after, world, war, ii, military, frogmen, continued, to, use, rebreathers, since, they, do, not, make, bubbles, which, would, give, away, the, presence, of, the, divers, the, high, percentage, of, oxygen, used, by, these, early, rebreather, systems, limited, the, depth, at, which, they, could, be, used, due, to, the, risk, of, convulsions, caused, by, acute, oxygen, toxicity, 1, 11, although, a, working, demand, regulator, system, had, been, invented, in, 1864, by, auguste, denayrouze, and, beno, t, rouquayrol, the, first, open, circuit, scuba, system, developed, in, 1925, by, yves, le, prieur, in, france, was, a, manually, adjusted, free, flow, system, with, a, low, endurance, which, limited, its, practical, usefulness, in, 1942, during, the, german, occupation, of, france, jacques, yves, cousteau, and, mile, gagnan, designed, the, first, successful, and, safe, open, circuit, scuba, known, as, the, aqua, lung, their, system, combined, an, improved, demand, regulator, with, high, pressure, air, tanks, this, was, patented, in, 1945, to, sell, his, regulator, in, english, speaking, countries, cousteau, registered, the, aqua, lung, trademark, which, was, first, licensed, to, the, u, s, divers, company, and, in, 1948, to, siebe, gorman, of, england, siebe, gorman, was, allowed, to, sell, in, commonwealth, countries, but, had, difficulty, in, meeting, the, demand, and, the, u, s, patent, prevented, others, from, making, the, product, the, patent, was, circumvented, by, ted, eldred, of, melbourne, australia, who, developed, the, single, hose, open, circuit, scuba, system, which, separates, the, first, stage, and, demand, valve, of, the, pressure, regulator, by, a, low, pressure, hose, puts, the, demand, valve, at, the, diver, s, mouth, and, releases, exhaled, gas, through, the, demand, valve, casing, eldred, sold, the, first, porpoise, model, ca, single, hose, scuba, early, in, 1952, early, scuba, sets, were, usually, provided, with, a, plain, harness, of, shoulder, straps, and, a, waist, belt, the, waist, belt, buckles, were, usually, quick, release, and, shoulder, straps, sometimes, had, adjustable, or, quick, release, buckles, many, harnesses, did, not, have, a, backplate, and, the, cylinders, rested, directly, against, the, diver, s, back, early, scuba, divers, dived, without, a, buoyancy, aid, in, an, emergency, they, had, to, jettison, their, weights, in, the, 1960s, adjustable, buoyancy, life, jackets, ablj, became, available, which, can, be, used, to, compensate, for, loss, of, buoyancy, at, depth, due, to, compression, of, the, neoprene, wetsuit, and, as, a, lifejacket, that, will, hold, an, unconscious, diver, face, upwards, at, the, surface, and, that, can, be, quickly, inflated, the, first, versions, were, inflated, from, a, small, disposable, carbon, dioxide, cylinder, later, with, a, small, direct, coupled, air, cylinder, a, low, pressure, feed, from, the, regulator, first, stage, to, an, inflation, deflation, valve, unit, an, oral, inflation, valve, and, a, dump, valve, lets, the, volume, of, the, ablj, be, controlled, as, a, buoyancy, aid, in, 1971, the, stabilizer, jacket, was, introduced, by, scubapro, this, class, of, buoyancy, aid, is, known, as, a, buoyancy, control, device, or, buoyancy, compensator, a, backplate, and, wing, is, an, alternative, configuration, of, a, scuba, harness, with, a, buoyancy, compensation, bladder, known, as, a, wing, mounted, behind, the, diver, sandwiched, between, the, backplate, and, the, cylinder, or, cylinders, unlike, stabilizer, jackets, the, backplate, and, wing, is, a, modular, system, in, that, it, consists, of, separable, components, this, arrangement, became, popular, with, cave, divers, making, long, or, deep, dives, who, needed, to, carry, several, extra, cylinders, as, it, clears, the, front, and, sides, of, the, diver, for, other, equipment, to, be, attached, in, the, region, where, it, is, easily, accessible, this, additional, equipment, is, usually, suspended, from, the, harness, or, carried, in, pockets, on, the, exposure, suit, sidemount, is, a, scuba, diving, equipment, configuration, which, has, basic, scuba, sets, each, comprising, a, single, cylinder, with, a, dedicated, regulator, and, pressure, gauge, mounted, alongside, the, diver, clipped, to, the, harness, below, the, shoulders, and, along, the, hips, instead, of, on, the, back, of, the, diver, it, originated, as, a, configuration, for, advanced, cave, diving, as, it, facilitates, penetration, of, tight, sections, of, caves, since, sets, can, be, easily, removed, and, remounted, when, necessary, the, configuration, allows, easy, access, to, cylinder, valves, and, provides, easy, and, reliable, gas, redundancy, these, benefits, for, operating, in, confined, spaces, were, also, recognized, by, divers, who, made, wreck, diving, penetrations, sidemount, diving, has, grown, in, popularity, within, the, technical, diving, community, for, general, decompression, diving, and, has, become, a, popular, speciality, for, recreational, diving, in, the, 1950s, the, united, states, navy, usn, documented, enriched, oxygen, gas, procedures, for, military, use, of, what, is, today, called, nitrox, and, in, 1970, morgan, wells, of, noaa, began, instituting, diving, procedures, for, oxygen, enriched, air, in, 1979, noaa, published, procedures, for, the, scientific, use, of, nitrox, in, the, noaa, diving, manual, in, 1985, iand, international, association, of, nitrox, divers, began, teaching, nitrox, use, for, recreational, diving, this, was, considered, dangerous, by, some, and, met, with, heavy, skepticism, by, the, diving, community, nevertheless, in, 1992, naui, became, the, first, existing, major, recreational, diver, training, agency, to, sanction, nitrox, and, eventually, in, 1996, the, professional, association, of, diving, instructors, padi, announced, full, educational, support, for, nitrox, the, use, of, a, single, nitrox, mixture, has, become, part, of, recreational, diving, and, multiple, gas, mixtures, are, common, in, technical, diving, to, reduce, overall, decompression, time, technical, diving, is, recreational, scuba, diving, that, exceeds, the, generally, accepted, recreational, limits, and, may, expose, the, diver, to, hazards, beyond, those, normally, associated, with, recreational, diving, and, to, greater, risks, of, serious, injury, or, death, these, risks, may, be, reduced, by, appropriate, skills, knowledge, and, experience, and, by, using, suitable, equipment, and, procedures, the, concept, and, term, are, both, relatively, recent, advents, although, divers, had, already, been, engaging, in, what, is, now, commonly, referred, to, as, technical, diving, for, decades, one, reasonably, widely, held, definition, is, that, any, dive, in, which, at, some, point, of, the, planned, profile, it, is, not, physically, possible, or, physiologically, acceptable, to, make, a, direct, and, uninterrupted, vertical, ascent, to, surface, air, is, a, technical, dive, the, equipment, often, involves, breathing, gases, other, than, air, or, standard, nitrox, mixtures, multiple, gas, sources, and, different, equipment, configurations, over, time, some, equipment, and, techniques, developed, for, technical, diving, have, become, more, widely, accepted, for, recreational, diving, oxygen, toxicity, limits, the, depth, reachable, by, underwater, divers, when, breathing, nitrox, mixtures, in, 1924, the, us, navy, started, to, investigate, the, possibility, of, using, helium, and, after, animal, experiments, human, subjects, breathing, heliox, 20, 80, 20, oxygen, 80, helium, were, successfully, decompressed, from, deep, dives, in, 1963, saturation, dives, using, trimix, were, made, during, project, genesis, and, in, 1979, a, research, team, at, the, duke, university, medical, center, hyperbaric, laboratory, started, work, which, identified, the, use, of, trimix, to, prevent, the, symptoms, of, high, pressure, nervous, syndrome, cave, divers, started, using, trimix, to, allow, deeper, dives, and, it, was, used, extensively, in, the, 1987, wakulla, springs, project, and, spread, to, the, north, east, american, wreck, diving, community, the, challenges, of, deeper, dives, and, longer, penetrations, and, the, large, amounts, of, breathing, gas, necessary, for, these, dive, profiles, and, ready, availability, of, oxygen, sensing, cells, beginning, in, the, late, 1980s, led, to, a, resurgence, of, interest, in, rebreather, diving, by, accurately, measuring, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, it, became, possible, to, maintain, and, accurately, monitor, a, breathable, gas, mixture, in, the, loop, at, any, depth, in, the, mid, 1990s, semi, closed, circuit, rebreathers, became, available, for, the, recreational, scuba, market, followed, by, closed, circuit, rebreathers, around, the, turn, of, the, millennium, rebreathers, are, currently, manufactured, for, the, military, technical, and, recreational, scuba, markets, but, remain, less, popular, less, reliable, and, more, expensive, than, open, circuit, equipment, scuba, diving, equipment, also, known, as, scuba, gear, is, the, equipment, used, by, a, scuba, diver, for, the, purpose, of, diving, and, includes, the, breathing, apparatus, diving, suit, buoyancy, control, and, weighting, systems, fins, for, mobility, mask, for, improving, underwater, vision, and, a, variety, of, safety, equipment, and, other, accessories, the, defining, equipment, used, by, a, scuba, diver, is, the, eponymous, scuba, the, self, contained, underwater, breathing, apparatus, which, allows, the, diver, to, breathe, while, diving, and, is, transported, by, the, diver, it, is, also, commonly, referred, to, as, the, scuba, set, as, one, descends, in, addition, to, the, normal, atmospheric, pressure, at, the, surface, the, water, exerts, increasing, hydrostatic, pressure, of, approximately, 1, bar, 14, 7, pounds, per, square, inch, for, every, 10, m, 33, feet, of, depth, the, pressure, of, the, inhaled, breath, must, balance, the, surrounding, or, ambient, pressure, to, allow, controlled, inflation, of, the, lungs, it, becomes, virtually, impossible, to, breathe, air, at, normal, atmospheric, pressure, through, a, tube, below, 3, feet, 0, 9, m, under, the, water, most, recreational, scuba, diving, is, done, using, a, half, mask, which, covers, the, diver, s, eyes, and, nose, and, a, mouthpiece, to, supply, the, breathing, gas, from, the, demand, valve, or, rebreather, inhaling, from, a, mouthpiece, becomes, second, nature, very, quickly, the, other, common, arrangement, is, a, full, face, mask, which, covers, the, eyes, nose, and, mouth, and, often, allows, the, diver, to, breathe, through, the, nose, professional, scuba, divers, are, more, likely, to, use, full, face, masks, which, protect, the, diver, s, airway, if, the, diver, loses, consciousness, open, circuit, scuba, has, no, provision, for, using, the, breathing, gas, more, than, once, for, respiration, the, gas, inhaled, from, the, scuba, equipment, is, exhaled, to, the, environment, or, occasionally, into, another, item, of, equipment, for, a, special, purpose, usually, to, increase, the, buoyancy, of, a, lifting, device, such, as, a, buoyancy, compensator, inflatable, surface, marker, buoy, or, small, lifting, bag, the, breathing, gas, is, generally, provided, from, a, high, pressure, diving, cylinder, through, a, scuba, regulator, by, always, providing, the, appropriate, breathing, gas, at, ambient, pressure, demand, valve, regulators, ensure, the, diver, can, inhale, and, exhale, naturally, and, without, excessive, effort, regardless, of, depth, as, and, when, needed, the, most, commonly, used, scuba, set, uses, a, single, hose, open, circuit, 2, stage, demand, regulator, connected, to, a, single, back, mounted, high, pressure, gas, cylinder, with, the, first, stage, connected, to, the, cylinder, valve, and, the, second, stage, at, the, mouthpiece, this, arrangement, differs, from, mile, gagnan, s, and, jacques, cousteau, s, original, 1942, twin, hose, design, known, as, the, aqua, lung, in, which, the, cylinder, pressure, was, reduced, to, ambient, pressure, in, one, or, two, stages, which, were, all, in, the, housing, mounted, to, the, cylinder, valve, or, manifold, the, single, hose, system, has, significant, advantages, over, the, original, system, for, most, applications, in, the, single, hose, two, stage, design, the, first, stage, regulator, reduces, the, cylinder, pressure, of, up, to, about, 300, bars, 4, 400, psi, to, an, intermediate, pressure, ip, of, about, 8, to, 10, bars, 120, to, 150, psi, above, ambient, pressure, the, second, stage, demand, valve, regulator, supplied, by, a, low, pressure, hose, from, the, first, stage, delivers, the, breathing, gas, at, ambient, pressure, to, the, diver, s, mouth, the, exhaled, gases, are, exhausted, directly, to, the, environment, as, waste, through, a, non, return, valve, on, the, second, stage, housing, the, first, stage, typically, has, at, least, one, outlet, port, delivering, gas, at, full, tank, pressure, which, is, connected, to, the, diver, s, submersible, pressure, gauge, or, dive, computer, to, show, how, much, breathing, gas, remains, in, the, cylinder, less, common, are, closed, circuit, ccr, and, semi, closed, scr, rebreathers, which, unlike, open, circuit, sets, that, vent, off, all, exhaled, gases, process, all, or, part, of, each, exhaled, breath, for, re, use, by, removing, the, carbon, dioxide, and, replacing, the, oxygen, used, by, the, diver, rebreathers, release, few, or, no, gas, bubbles, into, the, water, and, use, much, less, stored, gas, volume, for, an, equivalent, depth, and, time, because, exhaled, oxygen, is, recovered, this, has, advantages, for, research, military, photography, and, other, applications, rebreathers, are, more, complex, and, more, expensive, than, open, circuit, scuba, and, special, training, and, correct, maintenance, are, required, for, them, to, be, safely, used, due, to, the, larger, variety, of, potential, failure, modes, in, a, closed, circuit, rebreather, the, oxygen, partial, pressure, in, the, rebreather, is, controlled, so, it, can, be, maintained, at, a, safe, continuous, maximum, which, reduces, the, inert, gas, nitrogen, and, or, helium, partial, pressure, in, the, breathing, loop, minimising, the, inert, gas, loading, of, the, diver, s, tissues, for, a, given, dive, profile, reduces, the, decompression, obligation, this, requires, continuous, monitoring, of, actual, partial, pressures, with, time, and, for, maximum, effectiveness, requires, real, time, computer, processing, by, the, diver, s, decompression, computer, decompression, can, be, much, reduced, compared, to, fixed, ratio, gas, mixes, used, in, other, scuba, systems, and, as, a, result, divers, can, stay, down, longer, or, require, less, time, to, decompress, a, semi, closed, circuit, rebreather, injects, a, constant, mass, flow, of, a, fixed, breathing, gas, mixture, into, the, breathing, loop, or, replaces, a, specific, percentage, of, the, respired, volume, so, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, at, any, time, during, the, dive, depends, on, the, diver, s, oxygen, consumption, and, or, breathing, rate, planning, decompression, requirements, requires, a, more, conservative, approach, for, a, scr, than, for, a, ccr, but, decompression, computers, with, a, real, time, oxygen, partial, pressure, input, can, optimise, decompression, for, these, systems, because, rebreathers, produce, very, few, bubbles, they, do, not, disturb, marine, life, or, make, a, diver, s, presence, known, at, the, surface, this, is, useful, for, underwater, photography, and, for, covert, work, for, some, diving, gas, mixtures, other, than, normal, atmospheric, air, 21, oxygen, 78, nitrogen, 1, trace, gases, can, be, used, so, long, as, the, diver, is, competent, in, their, use, the, most, commonly, used, mixture, is, nitrox, also, referred, to, as, enriched, air, nitrox, ean, or, eanx, which, is, air, with, extra, oxygen, often, with, 32, or, 36, oxygen, and, thus, less, nitrogen, reducing, the, risk, of, decompression, sickness, or, allowing, longer, exposure, to, the, same, pressure, for, equal, risk, the, reduced, nitrogen, may, also, allow, for, no, stops, or, shorter, decompression, stop, times, or, a, shorter, surface, interval, between, dives, 304, the, increased, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, due, to, the, higher, oxygen, content, of, nitrox, increases, the, risk, of, oxygen, toxicity, which, becomes, unacceptable, below, the, maximum, operating, depth, of, the, mixture, to, displace, nitrogen, without, the, increased, oxygen, concentration, other, diluent, gases, can, be, used, usually, helium, when, the, resultant, three, gas, mixture, is, called, trimix, and, when, the, nitrogen, is, fully, substituted, by, helium, heliox, for, dives, requiring, long, decompression, stops, divers, may, carry, cylinders, containing, different, gas, mixtures, for, the, various, phases, of, the, dive, typically, designated, as, travel, bottom, and, decompression, gases, these, different, gas, mixtures, may, be, used, to, extend, bottom, time, reduce, inert, gas, narcotic, effects, and, reduce, decompression, times, back, gas, refers, to, any, gas, carried, on, the, diver, s, back, usually, bottom, gas, to, take, advantage, of, the, freedom, of, movement, afforded, by, scuba, equipment, the, diver, needs, to, be, mobile, underwater, personal, mobility, is, enhanced, by, swimfins, and, optionally, diver, propulsion, vehicles, fins, have, a, large, blade, area, and, use, the, more, powerful, leg, muscles, so, are, much, more, efficient, for, propulsion, and, manoeuvering, thrust, than, arm, and, hand, movements, but, require, skill, to, provide, fine, control, several, types, of, fin, are, available, some, of, which, may, be, more, suited, for, maneuvering, alternative, kick, styles, speed, endurance, reduced, effort, or, ruggedness, neutral, buoyancy, will, allow, propulsive, effort, to, be, directed, in, the, direction, of, intended, motion, and, will, reduce, induced, drag, streamlining, dive, gear, will, also, reduce, drag, and, improve, mobility, balanced, trim, which, allows, the, diver, to, align, in, any, desired, direction, also, improves, streamlining, by, presenting, the, smallest, section, area, to, the, direction, of, movement, and, allowing, propulsion, thrust, to, be, used, more, efficiently, occasionally, a, diver, may, be, towed, using, a, sled, an, unpowered, device, towed, behind, a, surface, vessel, that, conserves, the, diver, s, energy, and, allows, more, distance, to, be, covered, for, a, given, air, consumption, and, bottom, time, the, depth, is, usually, controlled, by, the, diver, by, using, diving, planes, or, by, tilting, the, whole, sled, some, sleds, are, faired, to, reduce, drag, on, the, diver, to, dive, safely, divers, must, control, their, rate, of, descent, and, ascent, in, the, water, and, be, able, to, maintain, a, constant, depth, in, midwater, ignoring, other, forces, such, as, water, currents, and, swimming, the, diver, s, overall, buoyancy, determines, whether, they, ascend, or, descend, equipment, such, as, diving, weighting, systems, diving, suits, wet, dry, or, semi, dry, suits, are, used, depending, on, the, water, temperature, and, buoyancy, compensators, bc, or, buoyancy, control, device, bcd, can, be, used, to, adjust, the, overall, buoyancy, when, divers, want, to, remain, at, constant, depth, they, try, to, achieve, neutral, buoyancy, this, minimises, the, effort, of, swimming, to, maintain, depth, and, therefore, reduces, gas, consumption, the, buoyancy, force, on, the, diver, is, the, weight, of, the, volume, of, the, liquid, that, they, and, their, equipment, displace, minus, the, weight, of, the, diver, and, their, equipment, if, the, result, is, positive, that, force, is, upwards, the, buoyancy, of, any, object, immersed, in, water, is, also, affected, by, the, density, of, the, water, the, density, of, fresh, water, is, about, 3, less, than, that, of, ocean, water, therefore, divers, who, are, neutrally, buoyant, at, one, dive, destination, e, g, a, freshwater, lake, will, predictably, be, positively, or, negatively, buoyant, when, using, the, same, equipment, at, destinations, with, different, water, densities, e, g, a, tropical, coral, reef, the, removal, ditching, or, shedding, of, diver, weighting, systems, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, diver, s, weight, and, cause, a, buoyant, ascent, in, an, emergency, diving, suits, made, of, compressible, materials, decrease, in, volume, as, the, diver, descends, and, expand, again, as, the, diver, ascends, causing, buoyancy, changes, diving, in, different, environments, also, necessitates, adjustments, in, the, amount, of, weight, carried, to, achieve, neutral, buoyancy, the, diver, can, inject, air, into, dry, suits, to, counteract, the, compression, effect, and, squeeze, buoyancy, compensators, allow, easy, and, fine, adjustments, in, the, diver, s, overall, volume, and, therefore, buoyancy, neutral, buoyancy, in, a, diver, is, an, unstable, state, it, is, changed, by, small, differences, in, ambient, pressure, caused, by, a, change, in, depth, and, the, change, has, a, positive, feedback, effect, a, small, descent, will, increase, the, pressure, which, will, compress, the, gas, filled, spaces, and, reduce, the, total, volume, of, diver, and, equipment, this, will, further, reduce, the, buoyancy, and, unless, counteracted, will, result, in, sinking, more, rapidly, the, equivalent, effect, applies, to, a, small, ascent, which, will, trigger, an, increased, buoyancy, and, will, result, in, an, accelerated, ascent, unless, counteracted, the, diver, must, continuously, adjust, buoyancy, or, depth, in, order, to, remain, neutral, fine, control, of, buoyancy, can, be, achieved, by, controlling, the, average, lung, volume, in, open, circuit, scuba, but, this, feature, is, not, available, to, the, closed, circuit, rebreather, diver, as, exhaled, gas, remains, in, the, breathing, loop, this, is, a, skill, that, improves, with, practice, until, it, becomes, second, nature, buoyancy, changes, with, depth, variation, are, proportional, to, the, compressible, part, of, the, volume, of, the, diver, and, equipment, and, to, the, proportional, change, in, pressure, which, is, greater, per, unit, of, depth, near, the, surface, minimising, the, volume, of, gas, required, in, the, buoyancy, compensator, will, minimise, the, buoyancy, fluctuations, with, changes, in, depth, this, can, be, achieved, by, accurate, selection, of, ballast, weight, which, should, be, the, minimum, to, allow, neutral, buoyancy, with, depleted, gas, supplies, at, the, end, of, the, dive, unless, there, is, an, operational, requirement, for, greater, negative, buoyancy, during, the, dive, buoyancy, and, trim, can, significantly, affect, drag, of, a, diver, the, effect, of, swimming, with, a, head, up, angle, of, about, 15, as, is, quite, common, in, poorly, trimmed, divers, can, be, an, increase, in, drag, in, the, order, of, 50, the, ability, to, ascend, at, a, controlled, rate, and, remain, at, a, constant, depth, is, important, for, correct, decompression, recreational, divers, who, do, not, incur, decompression, obligations, can, get, away, with, imperfect, buoyancy, control, but, when, long, decompression, stops, at, specific, depths, are, required, the, risk, of, decompression, sickness, is, increased, by, depth, variations, while, at, a, stop, decompression, stops, are, typically, done, when, the, breathing, gas, in, the, cylinders, has, been, largely, used, up, and, the, reduction, in, weight, of, the, cylinders, increases, the, buoyancy, of, the, diver, enough, weight, must, be, carried, to, allow, the, diver, to, decompress, at, the, end, of, the, dive, with, nearly, empty, cylinders, depth, control, during, ascent, is, facilitated, by, ascending, on, a, line, with, a, buoy, at, the, top, the, diver, can, remain, marginally, negative, and, easily, maintain, depth, by, holding, onto, the, line, a, shotline, or, decompression, buoy, are, commonly, used, for, this, purpose, precise, and, reliable, depth, control, are, particularly, valuable, when, the, diver, has, a, large, decompression, obligation, as, it, allows, the, theoretically, most, efficient, decompression, at, the, lowest, reasonably, practicable, risk, ideally, the, diver, should, practice, precise, buoyancy, control, when, the, risk, of, decompression, sickness, due, to, depth, variation, violating, the, decompression, ceiling, is, low, water, has, a, higher, refractive, index, than, air, similar, to, that, of, the, cornea, of, the, eye, light, entering, the, cornea, from, water, is, hardly, refracted, at, all, leaving, only, the, eye, s, crystalline, lens, to, focus, light, this, leads, to, very, severe, hypermetropia, people, with, severe, myopia, therefore, can, see, better, underwater, without, a, mask, than, normal, sighted, people, diving, masks, and, helmets, solve, this, problem, by, providing, an, air, space, in, front, of, the, diver, s, eyes, the, refraction, error, created, by, the, water, is, mostly, corrected, as, the, light, travels, from, water, to, air, through, a, flat, lens, except, that, objects, appear, approximately, 34, bigger, and, 25, closer, in, water, than, they, actually, are, the, faceplate, of, the, mask, is, supported, by, a, frame, and, skirt, which, are, opaque, or, translucent, therefore, the, total, field, of, view, is, significantly, reduced, and, eye, hand, coordination, must, be, adjusted, divers, who, need, corrective, lenses, to, see, clearly, outside, the, water, would, normally, need, the, same, prescription, while, wearing, a, mask, generic, corrective, lenses, are, available, off, the, shelf, for, some, two, window, masks, and, custom, lenses, can, be, bonded, onto, masks, that, have, a, single, front, window, or, two, windows, as, a, diver, descends, they, must, periodically, exhale, through, their, nose, to, equalise, the, internal, pressure, of, the, mask, with, that, of, the, surrounding, water, swimming, goggles, are, not, suitable, for, diving, because, they, only, cover, the, eyes, and, thus, do, not, allow, for, equalisation, failure, to, equalise, the, pressure, inside, the, mask, may, lead, to, a, form, of, barotrauma, known, as, mask, squeeze, masks, tend, to, fog, when, warm, humid, exhaled, air, condenses, on, the, cold, inside, of, the, faceplate, to, prevent, fogging, many, divers, spit, into, the, dry, mask, before, use, spread, the, saliva, over, the, inside, of, the, glass, and, rinse, it, out, with, a, little, water, the, saliva, residue, allows, condensation, to, wet, the, glass, and, form, a, continuous, wet, film, rather, than, tiny, droplets, there, are, several, commercial, products, that, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, saliva, some, of, which, are, more, effective, and, last, longer, but, there, is, a, risk, of, getting, the, anti, fog, agent, in, the, eyes, water, attenuates, light, by, selective, absorption, pure, water, preferentially, absorbs, red, light, and, to, a, lesser, extent, yellow, and, green, so, the, colour, that, is, least, absorbed, is, blue, light, dissolved, materials, may, also, selectively, absorb, colour, in, addition, to, the, absorption, by, the, water, itself, in, other, words, as, a, diver, goes, deeper, on, a, dive, more, colour, is, absorbed, by, the, water, and, in, clean, water, the, colour, becomes, blue, with, depth, colour, vision, is, also, affected, by, the, turbidity, of, the, water, which, tends, to, reduce, contrast, artificial, light, is, useful, to, provide, light, in, the, darkness, to, restore, contrast, at, close, range, and, to, restore, natural, colour, lost, to, absorption, dive, lights, can, also, attract, fish, and, a, variety, of, other, sea, creatures, protection, from, heat, loss, in, cold, water, is, usually, provided, by, wetsuits, or, dry, suits, these, also, provide, protection, from, sunburn, abrasion, and, stings, from, some, marine, organisms, where, thermal, insulation, is, not, important, lycra, suits, diving, skins, may, be, sufficient, a, wetsuit, is, a, garment, usually, made, of, foamed, neoprene, which, provides, thermal, insulation, abrasion, resistance, and, buoyancy, the, insulation, properties, depend, on, bubbles, of, gas, enclosed, within, the, material, which, reduce, its, ability, to, conduct, heat, the, bubbles, also, give, the, wetsuit, a, low, density, providing, buoyancy, in, water, suits, range, from, a, thin, 2, mm, or, less, shortie, covering, just, the, torso, to, a, full, 8, mm, semi, dry, usually, complemented, by, neoprene, boots, gloves, and, hood, a, good, close, fit, and, few, zips, help, the, suit, to, remain, waterproof, and, reduce, flushing, the, replacement, of, water, trapped, between, suit, and, body, by, cold, water, from, the, outside, improved, seals, at, the, neck, wrists, and, ankles, and, baffles, under, the, entry, zip, produce, a, suit, known, as, semi, dry, a, dry, suit, also, provides, thermal, insulation, to, the, wearer, while, immersed, in, water, and, normally, protects, the, whole, body, except, the, head, hands, and, sometimes, the, feet, in, some, configurations, these, are, also, covered, dry, suits, are, usually, used, where, the, water, temperature, is, below, 15, c, 60, f, or, for, extended, immersion, in, water, above, 15, c, 60, f, where, a, wetsuit, user, would, get, cold, and, with, an, integral, helmet, boots, and, gloves, for, personal, protection, when, diving, in, contaminated, water, dry, suits, are, designed, to, prevent, water, from, entering, this, generally, allows, better, insulation, making, them, more, suitable, for, use, in, cold, water, they, can, be, uncomfortably, hot, in, warm, or, hot, air, and, are, typically, more, expensive, and, more, complex, to, don, for, divers, they, add, some, degree, of, complexity, as, the, suit, must, be, inflated, and, deflated, with, changes, in, depth, in, order, to, avoid, squeeze, on, descent, or, uncontrolled, rapid, ascent, due, to, over, buoyancy, dry, suit, divers, may, also, use, the, gas, argon, to, inflate, their, suits, via, low, pressure, inflator, hose, this, is, because, the, gas, is, inert, and, has, a, low, thermal, conductivity, unless, the, maximum, depth, of, the, water, is, known, and, is, quite, shallow, a, diver, must, monitor, the, depth, and, duration, of, a, dive, to, avoid, decompression, sickness, traditionally, this, was, done, by, using, a, depth, gauge, and, a, diving, watch, but, electronic, dive, computers, are, now, in, general, use, as, they, are, programmed, to, do, real, time, modelling, of, decompression, requirements, for, the, dive, and, automatically, allow, for, surface, interval, many, can, be, set, for, the, gas, mixture, to, be, used, on, the, dive, and, some, can, accept, changes, in, the, gas, mix, during, the, dive, most, dive, computers, provide, a, fairly, conservative, decompression, model, and, the, level, of, conservatism, may, be, selected, by, the, user, within, limits, most, decompression, computers, can, also, be, set, for, altitude, compensation, to, some, degree, and, some, will, automatically, take, altitude, into, account, by, measuring, actual, atmospheric, pressure, and, using, it, in, the, calculations, if, the, dive, site, and, dive, plan, require, the, diver, to, navigate, a, compass, may, be, carried, and, where, retracing, a, route, is, critical, as, in, cave, or, wreck, penetrations, a, guide, line, is, laid, from, a, dive, reel, in, less, critical, conditions, many, divers, simply, navigate, by, landmarks, and, memory, a, procedure, also, known, as, pilotage, or, natural, navigation, a, scuba, diver, should, always, be, aware, of, the, remaining, breathing, gas, supply, and, the, duration, of, diving, time, that, this, will, safely, support, taking, into, account, the, time, required, to, surface, safely, and, an, allowance, for, foreseeable, contingencies, this, is, usually, monitored, by, using, a, submersible, pressure, gauge, on, each, cylinder, any, scuba, diver, who, will, be, diving, below, a, depth, from, which, they, are, competent, to, do, a, safe, emergency, swimming, ascent, should, ensure, that, they, have, an, alternative, breathing, gas, supply, available, at, all, times, in, case, of, a, failure, of, the, equipment, they, are, breathing, from, at, the, time, several, systems, are, in, common, use, depending, on, the, planned, dive, profile, most, common, but, least, reliable, is, relying, on, the, dive, buddy, for, gas, sharing, using, a, secondary, second, stage, commonly, called, an, octopus, regulator, connected, to, the, primary, first, stage, this, system, relies, entirely, on, the, dive, buddy, being, immediately, available, to, provide, emergency, gas, more, reliable, systems, require, the, diver, to, carry, an, alternative, gas, supply, sufficient, to, allow, the, diver, to, safely, reach, a, place, where, more, breathing, gas, is, available, for, open, water, recreational, divers, this, is, the, surface, a, bailout, cylinder, provides, emergency, breathing, gas, sufficient, for, a, safe, emergency, ascent, for, technical, divers, on, a, penetration, dive, it, may, be, a, stage, cylinder, positioned, at, a, point, on, the, exit, path, an, emergency, gas, supply, must, be, sufficiently, safe, to, breathe, at, any, point, on, the, planned, dive, profile, at, which, it, may, be, needed, this, equipment, may, be, a, bailout, cylinder, a, bailout, rebreather, a, travel, gas, cylinder, or, a, decompression, gas, cylinder, when, using, a, travel, gas, or, decompression, gas, the, back, gas, main, gas, supply, may, be, the, designated, emergency, gas, supply, cutting, tools, such, as, knives, line, cutters, or, shears, are, often, carried, by, divers, to, cut, loose, from, entanglement, in, nets, or, lines, a, surface, marker, buoy, smb, on, a, line, held, by, the, diver, indicates, the, position, of, the, diver, to, the, surface, personnel, this, may, be, an, inflatable, marker, deployed, by, the, diver, at, the, end, of, the, dive, or, a, sealed, float, towed, for, the, whole, dive, a, surface, marker, also, allows, easy, and, accurate, control, of, ascent, rate, and, stop, depth, for, safer, decompression, various, surface, detection, aids, may, be, carried, to, help, surface, personnel, spot, the, diver, after, ascent, in, addition, to, the, surface, marker, buoy, divers, may, carry, mirrors, lights, strobes, whistles, flares, or, emergency, locator, beacons, divers, may, carry, underwater, photographic, or, video, equipment, or, tools, for, a, specific, application, in, addition, to, diving, equipment, professional, divers, will, routinely, carry, and, use, tools, to, facilitate, their, underwater, work, while, most, recreational, divers, will, not, engage, in, underwater, work, breathing, from, scuba, is, mostly, a, straightforward, matter, under, most, circumstances, it, differs, very, little, from, normal, surface, breathing, in, the, case, of, a, full, face, mask, the, diver, may, usually, breathe, through, the, nose, or, mouth, as, preferred, and, in, the, case, of, a, mouth, held, demand, valve, the, diver, will, have, to, hold, the, mouthpiece, between, the, teeth, and, maintain, a, seal, around, it, with, the, lips, over, a, long, dive, this, can, induce, jaw, fatigue, and, for, some, people, a, gag, reflex, various, styles, of, mouthpiece, are, available, off, the, shelf, or, as, customised, items, and, one, of, them, may, work, better, if, either, of, these, problems, occur, the, frequently, quoted, warning, against, holding, one, s, breath, on, scuba, is, a, gross, oversimplification, of, the, actual, hazard, the, purpose, of, the, admonition, is, to, ensure, that, inexperienced, divers, do, not, accidentally, hold, their, breath, while, surfacing, as, the, expansion, of, gas, in, the, lungs, could, over, expand, the, lung, air, spaces, and, rupture, the, alveoli, and, their, capillaries, allowing, lung, gases, to, get, into, the, pulmonary, return, circulation, the, pleura, or, the, interstitial, areas, near, the, injury, where, it, could, cause, dangerous, medical, conditions, holding, the, breath, at, constant, depth, for, short, periods, with, a, normal, lung, volume, is, generally, harmless, providing, there, is, sufficient, ventilation, on, average, to, prevent, carbon, dioxide, buildup, and, is, done, as, a, standard, practice, by, underwater, photographers, to, avoid, startling, their, subjects, holding, the, breath, during, descent, can, eventually, cause, lung, squeeze, and, may, allow, the, diver, to, miss, warning, signs, of, a, gas, supply, malfunction, until, it, is, too, late, to, remedy, skilled, open, circuit, divers, make, small, adjustments, to, buoyancy, by, adjusting, their, average, lung, volume, during, the, breathing, cycle, this, adjustment, is, generally, in, the, order, of, a, kilogram, corresponding, to, a, litre, of, gas, and, can, be, maintained, for, a, moderate, period, but, it, is, more, comfortable, to, adjust, the, volume, of, the, buoyancy, compensator, over, the, longer, term, the, practice, of, shallow, breathing, or, skip, breathing, in, an, attempt, to, conserve, breathing, gas, should, be, avoided, as, it, is, inefficient, and, tends, to, cause, a, carbon, dioxide, buildup, which, can, result, in, headaches, and, a, reduced, capacity, to, recover, from, a, breathing, gas, supply, emergency, the, breathing, apparatus, will, generally, increase, dead, space, by, a, small, but, significant, amount, and, cracking, pressure, and, flow, resistance, in, the, demand, valve, will, cause, a, net, work, of, breathing, increase, which, will, reduce, the, diver, s, capacity, for, other, work, work, of, breathing, and, the, effect, of, dead, space, can, be, minimised, by, breathing, relatively, deeply, and, slowly, these, effects, increase, with, depth, as, density, and, friction, increase, in, proportion, to, the, increase, in, pressure, with, the, limiting, case, where, all, the, diver, s, available, energy, may, be, expended, on, simply, breathing, with, none, left, for, other, purposes, this, would, be, followed, by, a, buildup, in, carbon, dioxide, causing, an, urgent, feeling, of, a, need, to, breathe, and, if, this, cycle, is, not, broken, panic, and, drowning, are, likely, to, follow, the, use, of, a, low, density, inert, gas, typically, helium, in, the, breathing, mixture, can, reduce, this, problem, as, well, as, diluting, the, narcotic, effects, of, the, other, gases, breathing, from, a, rebreather, is, much, the, same, except, that, the, work, of, breathing, is, affected, mainly, by, flow, resistance, in, the, breathing, loop, this, is, partly, due, to, the, carbon, dioxide, absorbent, in, the, scrubber, and, is, related, to, the, distance, the, gas, passes, through, the, absorbent, material, and, the, size, of, the, gaps, between, the, grains, as, well, as, the, gas, composition, and, ambient, pressure, water, in, the, loop, can, greatly, increase, the, resistance, to, gas, flow, through, the, scrubber, there, is, even, less, point, in, shallow, or, skip, breathing, on, a, rebreather, as, this, does, not, even, conserve, gas, and, the, effect, on, buoyancy, is, negligible, when, the, sum, of, loop, volume, and, lung, volume, remains, constant, a, breathing, pattern, of, slow, deep, breaths, which, limits, gas, velocity, and, thereby, turbulent, flow, in, the, air, passages, will, minimise, the, work, of, breathing, for, a, given, gas, mixture, composition, and, density, and, respiratory, minute, volume, the, underwater, environment, is, unfamiliar, and, hazardous, and, to, ensure, diver, safety, simple, yet, necessary, procedures, must, be, followed, a, certain, minimum, level, of, attention, to, detail, and, acceptance, of, responsibility, for, one, s, own, safety, and, survival, are, required, most, of, the, procedures, are, simple, and, straightforward, and, become, second, nature, to, the, experienced, diver, but, must, be, learned, and, take, some, practice, to, become, automatic, and, faultless, just, like, the, ability, to, walk, or, talk, most, of, the, safety, procedures, are, intended, to, reduce, the, risk, of, drowning, and, many, of, the, rest, are, to, reduce, the, risk, of, barotrauma, and, decompression, sickness, in, some, applications, getting, lost, is, a, serious, hazard, and, specific, procedures, to, minimise, the, risk, are, followed, the, purpose, of, dive, planning, is, to, ensure, that, divers, do, not, exceed, their, comfort, zone, or, skill, level, or, the, safe, capacity, of, their, equipment, and, includes, gas, planning, to, ensure, that, the, amount, of, breathing, gas, to, be, carried, is, sufficient, to, allow, for, any, reasonably, foreseeable, contingencies, before, starting, a, dive, both, the, diver, and, their, buddy, do, equipment, checks, to, ensure, everything, is, in, good, working, order, and, available, recreational, divers, are, responsible, for, planning, their, own, dives, unless, in, training, when, the, instructor, is, responsible, divemasters, may, provide, useful, information, and, suggestions, to, assist, the, divers, but, are, generally, not, responsible, for, the, details, unless, specifically, employed, to, do, so, in, professional, diving, teams, all, team, members, are, usually, expected, to, contribute, to, planning, and, to, check, the, equipment, they, will, use, but, the, overall, responsibility, for, the, safety, of, the, team, lies, with, the, supervisor, as, the, appointed, on, site, representative, of, the, employer, some, procedures, are, common, to, almost, all, scuba, dives, or, are, used, to, manage, very, common, contingencies, these, are, learned, at, entry, level, and, may, be, highly, standardised, to, allow, efficient, cooperation, between, divers, trained, at, different, schools, inert, gas, components, of, the, diver, s, breathing, gas, accumulate, in, the, tissues, during, exposure, to, elevated, pressure, during, a, dive, and, must, be, eliminated, during, the, ascent, to, avoid, the, formation, of, symptomatic, bubbles, in, tissues, where, the, concentration, is, too, high, for, the, gas, to, remain, in, solution, this, process, is, called, decompression, and, occurs, on, all, scuba, dives, decompression, sickness, is, also, known, as, the, bends, and, can, also, include, symptoms, such, as, itching, rash, joint, pain, or, nausea, most, recreational, and, professional, scuba, divers, avoid, obligatory, decompression, stops, by, following, a, dive, profile, which, only, requires, a, limited, rate, of, ascent, for, decompression, but, will, commonly, also, do, an, optional, short, shallow, decompression, stop, known, as, a, safety, stop, to, further, reduce, risk, before, surfacing, in, some, cases, particularly, in, technical, diving, more, complex, decompression, procedures, are, necessary, decompression, may, follow, a, pre, planned, series, of, ascents, interrupted, by, stops, at, specific, depths, or, may, be, monitored, by, a, personal, decompression, computer, these, include, debriefing, where, appropriate, and, equipment, maintenance, to, ensure, that, the, equipment, is, kept, in, good, condition, for, later, use, it, is, also, considered, a, best, practice, to, log, each, dive, upon, completion, this, is, done, for, several, reasons, if, a, diver, is, planning, on, doing, multiple, dives, in, a, day, they, need, to, know, what, the, depth, and, duration, of, previous, dives, were, in, order, to, calculate, residual, inert, gas, levels, in, preparation, for, the, next, dive, it, is, helpful, to, note, what, equipment, was, used, for, each, dive, and, what, the, conditions, were, like, for, reference, when, planning, another, similar, dive, for, example, the, thickness, and, type, of, wetsuit, used, during, a, dive, and, if, it, was, in, fresh, or, salt, water, will, influence, the, amount, of, weight, needed, knowing, this, information, and, taking, note, of, whether, the, weight, used, was, too, heavy, or, too, light, can, help, when, planning, another, dive, in, similar, conditions, in, order, to, achieve, a, level, of, certification, the, diver, may, be, required, to, present, evidence, of, a, specified, number, of, logged, and, verified, dives, professional, divers, may, be, legally, required, to, log, specific, information, for, every, working, dive, when, a, personal, dive, computer, is, used, it, will, accurately, record, the, details, of, the, dive, profile, and, this, data, can, usually, be, downloaded, to, an, electronic, logbook, in, which, the, diver, can, add, the, other, details, manually, buddy, and, team, diving, procedures, are, intended, to, ensure, that, a, recreational, scuba, diver, who, gets, into, difficulty, underwater, is, in, the, presence, of, a, similarly, equipped, person, who, will, understand, the, problem, and, can, render, assistance, divers, are, trained, to, assist, in, those, emergencies, specified, in, the, training, standards, for, their, certification, and, are, required, to, demonstrate, competence, in, a, set, of, prescribed, buddy, assistance, skills, the, fundamentals, of, buddy, and, team, safety, are, centred, on, diver, communication, redundancy, of, gear, and, breathing, gas, by, sharing, with, the, buddy, and, the, added, situational, perspective, of, another, diver, there, is, general, consensus, that, the, presence, of, a, buddy, both, willing, and, competent, to, assist, can, reduce, the, risk, of, certain, classes, of, accidents, but, much, less, agreement, on, how, often, this, happens, in, practice, solo, divers, take, responsibility, for, their, own, safety, and, compensate, for, the, absence, of, a, buddy, with, skill, vigilance, and, appropriate, equipment, like, buddy, or, team, divers, properly, equipped, solo, divers, rely, on, the, redundancy, of, critical, articles, of, dive, gear, which, may, include, at, least, two, independent, supplies, of, breathing, gas, and, ensuring, that, there, is, always, enough, available, to, safely, terminate, the, dive, if, any, one, supply, fails, the, difference, between, the, two, practices, is, that, this, redundancy, is, carried, and, managed, by, the, solo, diver, instead, of, a, buddy, agencies, that, certify, for, solo, diving, require, candidates, to, have, a, relatively, high, level, of, dive, experience, usually, about, 100, dives, or, more, since, the, inception, of, scuba, there, has, been, an, ongoing, debate, regarding, the, wisdom, of, solo, diving, with, strong, opinions, on, both, sides, of, the, issue, this, debate, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, line, which, separates, a, solo, diver, from, a, buddy, team, diver, is, not, always, clear, for, example, should, a, scuba, instructor, who, supports, the, buddy, system, be, considered, a, solo, diver, if, their, students, do, not, have, the, knowledge, or, experience, to, assist, the, instructor, through, an, unforeseen, scuba, emergency, should, the, buddy, of, an, underwater, photographer, consider, themselves, as, effectively, diving, alone, since, their, buddy, the, photographer, is, giving, most, or, all, of, their, attention, to, the, subject, of, the, photograph, this, debate, has, motivated, some, prominent, scuba, agencies, such, as, global, underwater, explorers, gue, to, stress, that, its, members, only, dive, in, teams, and, remain, aware, of, team, member, location, and, safety, at, all, times, other, agencies, such, as, scuba, diving, international, sdi, and, professional, association, of, diving, instructors, padi, have, taken, the, position, that, divers, might, find, themselves, alone, by, choice, or, by, accident, and, have, created, certification, courses, such, as, the, sdi, solo, diver, course, and, the, padi, self, reliant, diver, course, in, order, to, train, divers, to, handle, such, possibilities, other, organisations, such, as, the, international, diving, safety, standards, commission, idssc, do, not, accept, recreational, solo, diving, for, unspecified, psychological, social, and, technical, reasons, without, providing, logical, arguments, or, evidence, supporting, their, stance, it, is, not, clear, that, the, idssc, is, formally, recognised, in, the, role, they, have, claimed, the, most, urgent, underwater, emergencies, usually, involve, a, compromised, breathing, gas, supply, divers, are, trained, in, procedures, for, donating, and, receiving, breathing, gas, from, each, other, in, an, emergency, and, may, carry, an, independent, alternative, air, source, if, they, do, not, choose, to, rely, on, a, buddy, divers, may, need, to, make, an, emergency, ascent, in, the, event, of, a, loss, of, breathing, gas, which, cannot, be, managed, at, depth, controlled, emergency, ascents, are, almost, always, a, consequence, of, loss, of, breathing, gas, while, uncontrolled, ascents, are, usually, the, result, of, a, buoyancy, control, failure, other, urgent, emergencies, may, involve, loss, of, control, of, depth, and, medical, emergencies, divers, may, be, trained, in, procedures, that, have, been, approved, by, the, training, agencies, for, recovery, of, an, unresponsive, diver, to, the, surface, where, it, might, be, possible, to, administer, first, aid, not, all, recreational, divers, have, this, training, as, some, agencies, do, not, include, it, in, entry, level, training, professional, divers, may, be, required, by, legislation, or, code, of, practice, to, have, a, standby, diver, at, any, diving, operation, who, is, both, competent, and, available, to, attempt, rescue, of, a, distressed, diver, two, basic, types, of, entrapment, are, significant, hazards, for, scuba, divers, inability, to, navigate, out, of, an, enclosed, space, and, physical, entrapment, which, prevents, the, diver, from, leaving, a, location, the, first, case, can, usually, be, avoided, by, staying, out, of, enclosed, spaces, and, when, the, objective, of, the, dive, includes, penetration, of, enclosed, spaces, taking, precautions, such, as, the, use, of, lights, and, guidelines, for, which, specialised, training, is, provided, in, the, standard, procedures, the, most, common, form, of, physical, entrapment, is, getting, snagged, on, ropes, lines, or, nets, and, the, use, of, a, cutting, implement, is, the, standard, method, of, dealing, with, the, problem, the, risk, of, entanglement, can, be, reduced, by, careful, configuration, of, equipment, to, minimise, those, parts, which, can, easily, be, snagged, and, allow, easier, disentanglement, other, forms, of, entrapment, such, as, getting, wedged, into, tight, spaces, can, often, be, avoided, but, must, otherwise, be, dealt, with, as, they, happen, the, assistance, of, a, buddy, may, be, helpful, where, possible, scuba, diving, in, relatively, hazardous, environments, such, as, caves, and, wrecks, areas, of, strong, water, movement, relatively, great, depths, with, decompression, obligations, with, equipment, that, has, more, complex, failure, modes, and, with, gases, that, are, not, safe, to, breathe, at, all, depths, of, the, dive, require, specialised, safety, and, emergency, procedures, tailored, to, the, specific, hazards, and, often, specialised, equipment, these, conditions, are, generally, associated, with, technical, diving, the, depth, range, applicable, to, scuba, diving, depends, on, the, application, and, training, entry, level, divers, are, expected, to, limit, themselves, to, about, 60, feet, 18, m, to, 20, metres, 66, ft, the, major, worldwide, recreational, diver, certification, agencies, consider, 130, feet, 40, m, to, be, the, limit, for, recreational, diving, british, and, european, agencies, including, bsac, and, saa, recommend, a, maximum, depth, of, 50, metres, 160, ft, shallower, limits, are, recommended, for, divers, who, are, youthful, inexperienced, or, who, have, not, taken, training, for, deep, dives, technical, diving, extends, these, depth, limits, through, changes, to, training, equipment, and, the, gas, mix, used, the, maximum, depth, considered, safe, is, controversial, and, varies, among, agencies, and, instructors, however, there, are, programs, that, train, divers, for, dives, to, 120, metres, 390, ft, professional, diving, usually, limits, the, allowed, planned, decompression, depending, on, the, code, of, practice, operational, directives, or, statutory, restrictions, depth, limits, depend, on, the, jurisdiction, and, maximum, depths, allowed, range, from, 30, metres, 100, ft, to, more, than, 50, metres, 160, ft, depending, on, the, breathing, gas, used, and, the, availability, of, a, decompression, chamber, nearby, or, on, site, commercial, diving, using, scuba, is, generally, restricted, for, reasons, of, occupational, health, and, safety, surface, supplied, diving, allows, better, control, of, the, operation, and, eliminates, or, significantly, reduces, the, risks, of, loss, of, breathing, gas, supply, and, losing, the, diver, scientific, and, media, diving, applications, may, be, exempted, from, commercial, diving, constraints, based, on, acceptable, codes, of, practice, and, a, self, regulatory, system, scuba, diving, may, be, performed, for, a, number, of, reasons, both, personal, and, professional, recreational, diving, is, done, purely, for, enjoyment, and, has, a, number, of, technical, disciplines, to, increase, interest, underwater, such, as, cave, diving, wreck, diving, ice, diving, and, deep, diving, underwater, tourism, is, mostly, done, on, scuba, and, the, associated, tour, guiding, must, follow, suit, divers, may, be, employed, professionally, to, perform, tasks, underwater, some, of, these, tasks, are, suitable, for, scuba, there, are, divers, who, work, full, or, part, time, in, the, recreational, diving, community, as, instructors, assistant, instructors, divemasters, and, dive, guides, in, some, jurisdictions, the, professional, nature, with, particular, reference, to, responsibility, for, health, and, safety, of, the, clients, of, recreational, diver, instruction, dive, leadership, for, reward, and, dive, guiding, is, recognised, and, regulated, by, national, legislation, other, specialist, areas, of, scuba, diving, include, military, diving, with, a, long, history, of, military, frogmen, in, various, roles, their, roles, include, direct, combat, infiltration, behind, enemy, lines, placing, mines, or, using, a, manned, torpedo, bomb, disposal, or, engineering, operations, in, civilian, operations, many, police, forces, operate, police, diving, teams, to, perform, search, and, recovery, or, search, and, rescue, operations, and, to, assist, with, the, detection, of, crime, which, may, involve, bodies, of, water, in, some, cases, diver, rescue, teams, may, also, be, part, of, a, fire, department, paramedical, service, or, lifeguard, unit, and, may, be, classed, as, public, safety, diving, underwater, maintenance, and, research, in, large, aquariums, and, fish, farms, and, harvesting, of, marine, biological, resources, such, as, fish, abalones, crabs, lobsters, scallops, and, sea, crayfish, may, be, done, on, scuba, boat, and, ship, underwater, hull, inspection, cleaning, and, some, aspects, of, maintenance, ships, husbandry, may, be, done, on, scuba, by, commercial, divers, and, boat, owners, or, crew, lastly, there, are, professional, divers, involved, with, underwater, environments, such, as, underwater, photographers, or, underwater, videographers, who, document, the, underwater, world, or, scientific, diving, including, marine, biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography, and, underwater, archaeology, this, work, is, normally, done, on, scuba, as, it, provides, the, necessary, mobility, rebreathers, may, be, used, when, the, noise, of, open, circuit, would, alarm, the, subjects, or, the, bubbles, could, interfere, with, the, images, scientific, diving, under, the, osha, us, exemption, has, been, defined, as, being, diving, work, done, by, persons, with, and, using, scientific, expertise, to, observe, or, gather, data, on, natural, phenomena, or, systems, to, generate, non, proprietary, information, data, knowledge, or, other, products, as, a, necessary, part, of, a, scientific, research, or, educational, activity, following, the, direction, of, a, diving, safety, manual, and, a, diving, control, safety, board, the, choice, between, scuba, and, surface, supplied, diving, equipment, is, based, on, both, legal, and, logistical, constraints, where, the, diver, requires, mobility, and, a, large, range, of, movement, scuba, is, usually, the, choice, if, safety, and, legal, constraints, allow, higher, risk, work, particularly, in, commercial, diving, may, be, restricted, to, surface, supplied, equipment, by, legislation, and, codes, of, practice, the, safety, of, underwater, diving, depends, on, four, factors, the, environment, the, equipment, behaviour, of, the, individual, diver, and, performance, of, the, dive, team, the, underwater, environment, can, impose, severe, physical, and, psychological, stress, on, a, diver, and, is, mostly, beyond, the, diver, s, control, scuba, equipment, allows, the, diver, to, operate, underwater, for, limited, periods, and, the, reliable, function, of, some, of, the, equipment, is, critical, to, even, short, term, survival, other, equipment, allows, the, diver, to, operate, in, relative, comfort, and, efficiency, the, performance, of, the, individual, diver, depends, on, learned, skills, many, of, which, are, not, intuitive, and, the, performance, of, the, team, depends, on, competence, communication, and, common, goals, there, is, a, large, range, of, hazards, to, which, the, diver, may, be, exposed, these, each, have, associated, consequences, and, risks, which, should, be, taken, into, account, during, dive, planning, where, risks, are, marginally, acceptable, it, may, be, possible, to, mitigate, the, consequences, by, setting, contingency, and, emergency, plans, in, place, so, that, damage, can, be, minimised, where, reasonably, practicable, the, acceptable, level, of, risk, varies, depending, on, legislation, codes, of, practice, and, personal, choice, with, recreational, divers, having, a, greater, freedom, of, choice, divers, operate, in, an, environment, for, which, the, human, body, is, not, well, suited, they, face, special, physical, and, health, risks, when, they, go, underwater, or, use, high, pressure, breathing, gas, the, consequences, of, diving, incidents, range, from, merely, annoying, to, rapidly, fatal, and, the, result, often, depends, on, the, equipment, skill, response, and, fitness, of, the, diver, and, diving, team, the, hazards, include, the, aquatic, environment, the, use, of, breathing, equipment, in, an, underwater, environment, exposure, to, a, pressurised, environment, and, pressure, changes, particularly, pressure, changes, during, descent, and, ascent, and, breathing, gases, at, high, ambient, pressure, diving, equipment, other, than, breathing, apparatus, is, usually, reliable, but, has, been, known, to, fail, and, loss, of, buoyancy, control, or, thermal, protection, can, be, a, major, burden, which, may, lead, to, more, serious, problems, there, are, also, hazards, of, the, specific, diving, environment, and, hazards, related, to, access, to, and, egress, from, the, water, which, vary, from, place, to, place, and, may, also, vary, with, time, and, tide, hazards, inherent, in, the, diver, include, pre, existing, physiological, and, psychological, conditions, and, the, personal, behaviour, and, competence, of, the, individual, for, those, pursuing, other, activities, while, diving, there, are, additional, hazards, of, task, loading, of, the, dive, task, and, of, special, equipment, associated, with, the, task, the, presence, of, a, combination, of, several, hazards, simultaneously, is, common, in, diving, and, the, effect, is, generally, increased, risk, to, the, diver, particularly, where, the, occurrence, of, an, incident, due, to, one, hazard, triggers, other, hazards, with, a, resulting, cascade, of, incidents, many, diving, fatalities, are, the, result, of, a, cascade, of, incidents, overwhelming, the, diver, who, should, be, able, to, manage, any, single, reasonably, foreseeable, incident, although, there, are, many, dangers, involved, in, scuba, diving, divers, can, decrease, the, risks, through, proper, procedures, and, appropriate, equipment, the, requisite, skills, are, acquired, by, training, and, education, and, honed, by, practice, entry, level, certification, programmes, highlight, diving, physiology, safe, diving, practices, and, diving, hazards, but, do, not, provide, the, diver, with, sufficient, practice, to, become, truly, adept, scuba, divers, by, definition, carry, their, breathing, gas, supply, with, them, during, the, dive, and, this, limited, quantity, must, get, them, back, to, the, surface, safely, pre, dive, planning, of, appropriate, gas, supply, for, the, intended, dive, profile, lets, the, diver, allow, for, sufficient, breathing, gas, for, the, planned, dive, and, contingencies, they, are, not, connected, to, a, surface, control, point, by, an, umbilical, such, as, surface, supplied, divers, use, and, the, freedom, of, movement, that, this, allows, also, allows, the, diver, to, penetrate, overhead, environments, in, ice, diving, cave, diving, and, wreck, diving, to, the, extent, that, the, diver, may, lose, their, way, and, be, unable, to, find, the, way, out, this, problem, is, exacerbated, by, the, limited, breathing, gas, supply, which, gives, a, limited, amount, of, time, before, the, diver, will, drown, if, unable, to, surface, the, standard, procedure, for, managing, this, risk, is, to, lay, a, continuous, guideline, from, open, water, which, allows, the, diver, to, be, sure, of, the, route, to, the, surface, most, scuba, diving, particularly, recreational, scuba, uses, a, breathing, gas, supply, mouthpiece, that, is, gripped, by, the, diver, s, teeth, and, which, can, be, dislodged, relatively, easily, by, impact, this, is, generally, easily, rectified, unless, the, diver, is, incapacitated, and, the, associated, skills, are, part, of, entry, level, training, the, problem, becomes, severe, and, immediately, life, threatening, if, the, diver, loses, both, consciousness, and, the, mouthpiece, rebreather, mouthpieces, that, are, open, when, out, of, the, mouth, may, let, in, water, which, can, flood, the, loop, making, them, unable, to, deliver, breathing, gas, and, will, lose, buoyancy, as, the, gas, escapes, thus, putting, the, diver, in, a, situation, of, two, simultaneous, life, threatening, problems, skills, to, manage, this, situation, are, a, necessary, part, of, training, for, the, specific, configuration, full, face, masks, reduce, these, risks, and, are, generally, preferred, for, professional, scuba, diving, but, can, make, emergency, gas, sharing, difficult, and, are, less, popular, with, recreational, divers, who, often, rely, on, gas, sharing, with, a, buddy, as, their, breathing, gas, redundancy, option, the, risk, of, dying, during, recreational, scientific, or, commercial, diving, is, small, and, on, scuba, deaths, are, usually, associated, with, poor, gas, management, poor, buoyancy, control, equipment, misuse, entrapment, rough, water, conditions, and, pre, existing, health, problems, some, fatalities, are, inevitable, and, caused, by, unforeseeable, situations, escalating, out, of, control, but, the, majority, of, diving, fatalities, can, be, attributed, to, human, error, on, the, part, of, the, victim, equipment, failure, is, rare, in, well, maintained, open, circuit, scuba, that, has, been, set, up, and, tested, correctly, before, the, dive, according, to, death, certificates, over, 80, of, the, deaths, were, ultimately, attributed, to, drowning, but, other, factors, usually, combined, to, incapacitate, the, diver, in, a, sequence, of, events, culminating, in, drowning, which, is, more, a, consequence, of, the, medium, in, which, the, accidents, occurred, than, the, actual, accident, scuba, divers, should, not, drown, unless, there, are, other, contributory, factors, as, they, carry, a, supply, of, breathing, gas, and, equipment, designed, to, provide, the, gas, on, demand, drowning, occurs, as, a, consequence, of, preceding, problems, such, as, unmanageable, stress, cardiac, disease, pulmonary, barotrauma, unconsciousness, from, any, cause, water, aspiration, trauma, environmental, hazards, equipment, difficulties, inappropriate, response, to, an, emergency, or, failure, to, manage, the, gas, supply, and, often, obscures, the, real, cause, of, death, air, embolism, is, also, frequently, cited, as, a, cause, of, death, and, it, too, is, the, consequence, of, other, factors, leading, to, an, uncontrolled, and, badly, managed, ascent, possibly, aggravated, by, medical, conditions, about, a, quarter, of, diving, fatalities, are, associated, with, cardiac, events, mostly, in, older, divers, there, is, a, fairly, large, body, of, data, on, diving, fatalities, but, in, many, cases, the, data, is, poor, due, to, the, standard, of, investigation, and, reporting, this, hinders, research, that, could, improve, diver, safety, fatality, rates, are, comparable, with, jogging, 13, deaths, per, 100, 000, persons, per, year, and, are, within, the, range, where, reduction, is, desirable, by, health, and, safety, executive, hse, criteria, the, most, frequent, root, cause, for, diving, fatalities, is, running, out, of, or, low, on, gas, other, factors, cited, include, buoyancy, control, failure, entanglement, or, entrapment, rough, water, equipment, misuse, or, problems, and, emergency, ascent, the, most, common, injuries, and, causes, of, death, were, drowning, or, asphyxia, due, to, inhalation, of, water, air, embolism, and, cardiac, events, the, risk, of, cardiac, arrest, is, greater, for, older, divers, and, greater, for, men, than, women, although, the, risks, are, equal, by, age, 65, several, plausible, opinions, have, been, put, forward, but, have, not, yet, been, empirically, validated, suggested, contributing, factors, included, inexperience, infrequent, diving, inadequate, supervision, insufficient, pre, dive, briefings, buddy, separation, and, dive, conditions, beyond, the, diver, s, training, experience, or, physical, capacity, decompression, sickness, and, arterial, gas, embolism, in, recreational, diving, have, been, associated, with, specific, demographic, environmental, and, diving, behavioural, factors, a, statistical, study, published, in, 2005, tested, potential, risk, factors, age, asthma, body, mass, index, gender, smoking, cardiovascular, disease, diabetes, previous, decompression, illness, years, since, certification, number, of, dives, in, the, previous, year, number, of, consecutive, diving, days, number, of, dives, in, a, repetitive, series, depth, of, the, previous, dive, use, of, nitrox, as, breathing, gas, and, use, of, a, dry, suit, no, significant, associations, with, risk, of, decompression, sickness, or, arterial, gas, embolism, were, found, for, asthma, body, mass, index, cardiovascular, disease, diabetes, or, smoking, greater, dive, depth, previous, decompression, illness, number, of, consecutive, days, diving, and, male, sex, were, associated, with, higher, risk, for, decompression, sickness, and, arterial, gas, embolism, the, use, of, dry, suits, and, nitrox, breathing, gas, greater, frequency, of, diving, in, the, previous, year, greater, age, and, more, years, since, certification, were, associated, with, lower, risk, possibly, as, indicators, of, more, extensive, training, and, experience, risk, management, has, three, major, aspects, besides, equipment, and, training, risk, assessment, emergency, planning, and, insurance, cover, the, risk, assessment, for, a, dive, is, primarily, a, planning, activity, and, may, range, in, formality, from, a, part, of, the, pre, dive, buddy, check, for, recreational, divers, to, a, safety, file, with, professional, risk, assessment, and, detailed, emergency, plans, for, professional, diving, projects, some, form, of, pre, dive, briefing, is, customary, with, organised, recreational, dives, and, this, generally, includes, a, recitation, by, the, divemaster, of, the, known, and, predicted, hazards, the, risk, associated, with, the, significant, ones, and, the, procedures, to, be, followed, in, case, of, the, reasonably, foreseeable, emergencies, associated, with, them, insurance, cover, for, diving, accidents, may, not, be, included, in, standard, policies, there, are, a, few, organisations, that, focus, specifically, on, diver, safety, and, insurance, cover, such, as, the, international, divers, alert, network, a, scuba, emergency, is, an, incident, in, which, there, is, a, high, probability, of, death, or, severe, injury, if, the, problem, is, not, resolved, quickly, the, most, urgent, scuba, emergency, is, running, out, of, breathing, gas, under, water, often, referred, to, as, an, out, of, air, incident, it, is, a, true, emergency, as, without, access, to, breathing, gas, the, diver, will, die, within, a, few, minutes, this, emergency, can, be, managed, in, several, ways, including, assistance, by, a, dive, buddy, if, the, buddy, is, close, enough, to, help, by, sharing, breathing, gas, other, responses, are, by, the, diver, providing, themself, with, an, alternative, bailout, scuba, source, which, does, not, rely, on, a, buddy, another, alternative, which, is, viable, if, the, decompression, risk, is, low, and, there, is, no, hard, overhead, is, to, make, an, emergency, ascent, which, also, does, not, rely, on, a, buddy, other, interruptions, to, the, breathing, gas, supply, such, as, regulator, malfunctions, dislodging, of, the, regulator, or, full, face, mask, rolling, off, of, the, cylinder, valve, may, become, emergencies, if, not, managed, promptly, and, effectively, though, for, a, competent, diver, most, of, these, should, be, inconveniences, rather, than, emergencies, if, there, are, no, compounding, factors, oxygen, toxicity, convulsions, involve, a, temporary, loss, of, consciousness, during, which, the, diver, can, lose, the, mouthpiece, and, consequently, drown, an, observant, buddy, might, be, able, to, help, hypoxia, causing, loss, of, consciousness, can, be, due, to, breathing, from, the, wrong, cylinder, for, the, current, depth, or, a, rebreather, malfunction, an, observant, and, competent, buddy, may, be, able, to, help, irretrievable, loss, of, buoyancy, control, can, be, an, emergency, depending, on, when, it, occurs, whether, it, is, a, loss, of, buoyancy, eg, bc, failure, catastrophic, dry, suit, flood, or, an, excess, of, buoyancy, loss, of, weights, insufficient, weighting, at, end, of, deco, dive, whether, there, is, enough, breathing, gas, in, reserve, and, whether, there, is, a, decompression, obligation, an, observant, buddy, might, be, able, to, help, in, some, circumstances, types, and, causes, management, options, insufficient, weighting, at, the, end, of, a, dive, when, no, weights, have, been, lost, is, usually, an, indication, of, inadequate, training, and, failure, of, the, diver, to, take, responsibility, for, their, own, safety, and, is, usually, caused, by, the, diver, not, adequately, checking, that, they, are, correctly, weighted, for, the, dive, and, is, often, partly, due, to, poor, advice, from, rental, equipment, providers, symptomatic, omitted, or, insufficient, decompression, the, urgency, depends, on, the, symptoms, and, when, they, occur, pain, neurological, effects, inner, ear, vertigo, and, nuasea, in, some, cases, an, observant, and, competent, buddy, might, be, able, to, help, response, to, different, symptoms, carbon, dioxide, toxicity, due, to, rebreather, scrubber, breakthrough, overwhelming, work, of, breathing, could, be, caused, by, high, gas, density, regulator, malfunction, loop, flood, in, a, rebreather, or, excessive, exertion, with, hypercapnia, a, buddy, with, lower, work, of, breathing, may, be, able, to, perform, a, rescue, depending, on, the, cause, of, the, high, wob, a, dry, suit, flooding, in, frigid, water, presents, combined, risks, from, buoyancy, loss, and, hypothermia, there, is, nothing, the, buddy, can, do, to, help, for, hypothermia, and, not, much, for, buoyancy, loss, this, is, not, as, urgent, as, breathing, emergencies, but, can, be, a, definite, risk, to, life, loss, of, the, guideline, in, a, cave, or, wreck, when, out, of, sight, of, the, exit, a, buddy, may, be, able, to, help, depending, on, circumstances, scuba, training, is, normally, provided, by, a, qualified, instructor, who, is, a, member, of, one, or, more, diver, certification, agencies, or, is, registered, with, a, government, agency, basic, diver, training, entails, the, learning, of, skills, required, for, the, safe, conduct, of, activities, in, an, underwater, environment, and, includes, procedures, and, skills, for, the, use, of, diving, equipment, safety, emergency, self, help, and, rescue, procedures, dive, planning, and, use, of, dive, tables, or, a, personal, dive, computer, scuba, skills, which, an, entry, level, diver, will, normally, learn, include, some, knowledge, of, physiology, and, the, physics, of, diving, is, considered, necessary, by, most, diver, certification, agencies, as, the, diving, environment, is, alien, and, relatively, hostile, to, humans, the, physics, and, physiology, knowledge, required, is, fairly, basic, and, helps, the, diver, to, understand, the, effects, of, the, diving, environment, so, that, informed, acceptance, of, the, associated, risks, is, possible, the, physics, mostly, relates, to, gases, under, pressure, buoyancy, heat, loss, and, light, underwater, the, physiology, relates, the, physics, to, the, effects, on, the, human, body, to, provide, a, basic, understanding, of, the, causes, and, risks, of, barotrauma, decompression, sickness, gas, toxicity, hypothermia, drowning, and, sensory, variations, more, advanced, training, often, involves, first, aid, and, rescue, skills, skills, related, to, specialised, diving, equipment, and, underwater, work, skills, recreational, diver, training, is, the, process, of, developing, knowledge, and, understanding, of, the, basic, principles, and, the, skills, and, procedures, for, the, use, of, scuba, equipment, so, that, the, diver, is, able, to, dive, for, recreational, purposes, with, acceptable, risk, using, the, type, of, equipment, and, in, similar, conditions, to, those, experienced, during, training, recreational, including, technical, scuba, diving, does, not, have, a, centralised, certifying, or, regulatory, agency, and, is, mostly, self, regulated, there, are, however, several, international, organisations, of, varying, size, and, market, share, that, train, and, certify, divers, and, dive, instructors, and, many, diving, related, sales, and, rental, outlets, require, proof, of, diver, certification, from, one, of, these, organisations, prior, to, selling, or, renting, certain, diving, products, or, services, not, only, is, the, underwater, environment, hazardous, but, the, diving, equipment, itself, can, be, dangerous, there, are, problems, that, divers, must, learn, to, avoid, and, manage, when, they, do, occur, divers, need, repeated, practice, and, a, gradual, increase, in, the, challenge, to, develop, and, internalise, the, skills, needed, to, control, the, equipment, to, respond, effectively, if, they, encounter, difficulties, and, to, build, confidence, in, their, equipment, and, themselves, diver, practical, training, starts, with, simple, but, essential, procedures, and, builds, on, them, until, complex, procedures, can, be, managed, effectively, this, may, be, broken, up, into, several, short, training, programmes, with, certification, issued, for, each, stage, or, combined, into, a, few, more, substantial, programmes, with, certification, issued, when, all, the, skills, have, been, mastered, many, organizations, exist, throughout, the, world, offering, diver, training, leading, to, certification, the, issuing, of, a, diving, certification, card, also, known, as, a, c, card, or, qualification, card, this, diving, certification, model, originated, at, scripps, institution, of, oceanography, in, 1952, after, two, divers, died, while, using, university, owned, equipment, and, the, sio, instituted, a, system, where, a, card, was, issued, after, training, as, evidence, of, competence, diving, instructors, affiliated, to, a, diving, certification, agency, may, work, independently, or, through, a, university, a, dive, club, a, dive, school, or, a, dive, shop, they, will, offer, courses, that, should, meet, or, exceed, the, standards, of, the, certification, organization, that, will, certify, the, divers, attending, the, course, certification, of, the, diver, is, done, by, the, certification, organisation, on, application, by, the, registered, instructor, the, international, organization, for, standardization, has, approved, six, recreational, diving, standards, that, may, be, implemented, worldwide, and, some, of, the, standards, developed, by, the, world, recreational, scuba, training, council, are, consistent, with, the, applicable, iso, standards, as, are, equivalent, standards, published, by, the, conf, d, ration, mondiale, des, activit, s, subaquatiques, and, the, european, underwater, federation, the, initial, open, water, training, for, a, person, who, is, medically, fit, to, dive, and, a, reasonably, competent, swimmer, is, relatively, short, many, dive, shops, in, popular, holiday, locations, offer, courses, intended, to, teach, a, novice, to, dive, in, a, few, days, which, can, be, combined, with, diving, on, the, vacation, other, instructors, and, dive, schools, will, provide, more, thorough, training, which, generally, takes, longer, dive, operators, dive, shops, and, cylinder, filling, stations, may, refuse, to, allow, uncertified, people, to, dive, with, them, hire, diving, equipment, or, have, their, diving, cylinders, filled, this, may, be, an, agency, standard, company, policy, or, specified, by, legislation, it, is, fairly, common, for, a, national, standard, for, commercial, diver, training, and, registration, to, apply, within, a, country, these, standards, may, be, set, by, national, government, departments, and, empowered, by, national, legislation, for, example, in, the, case, of, the, united, kingdom, where, the, standards, are, set, by, the, health, and, safety, executive, and, south, africa, where, they, are, published, by, the, department, of, labour, many, national, training, standards, and,

similar, arrangement, exists, for, state, legislated, standards, as, in, the, case, of, canada, and, australia, registration, of, professional, divers, trained, to, these, standards, may, be, directly, administered, by, government, as, in, the, case, of, south, africa, where, diver, registration, is, done, by, the, department, of, labour, or, by, an, approved, external, agent, as, in, the, case, of, the, australian, diver, accreditation, scheme, adas, in, the, united, states, to, become, a, dive, master, you, must, be, approved, by, completing, courses, through, a, registered, diving,
