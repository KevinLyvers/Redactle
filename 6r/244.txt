about, 42, million, prostitutes, in, the, world, living, all, over, the, world, though, most, of, central, asia, the, middle, east, and, africa, lack, data, studied, countries, in, that, large, region, rank, as, top, sex, tourism, destinations, estimates, place, the, annual, revenue, generated, by, prostitution, worldwide, to, be, over, 100, billion, the, majority, of, prostitutes, are, female, and, have, male, clients, the, position, of, prostitution, and, the, law, varies, widely, worldwide, reflecting, differing, opinions, some, view, prostitution, as, a, form, of, exploitation, of, or, violence, against, women, and, children, that, helps, to, create, a, supply, of, victims, for, human, trafficking, some, critics, of, prostitution, as, an, institution, are, supporters, of, the, nordic, model, that, decriminalizes, the, act, of, selling, sex, and, makes, the, purchase, of, sex, illegal, this, approach, has, also, been, adopted, by, canada, iceland, ireland, northern, ireland, norway, france, and, sweden, others, view, sex, work, as, a, legitimate, occupation, whereby, a, person, trades, or, exchanges, sexual, acts, for, money, amnesty, international, is, one, of, the, notable, groups, calling, for, the, decriminalization, of, prostitution, prostitute, is, derived, from, the, latin, prostituta, some, sources, cite, the, verb, as, a, composition, of, pro, meaning, up, front, or, forward, and, stituere, defined, as, to, offer, up, for, sale, another, explanation, is, that, prostituta, is, a, composition, of, pro, and, statuere, to, cause, to, stand, to, station, place, erect, a, literal, translation, therefore, is, to, put, up, front, for, sale, or, to, place, forward, the, online, etymology, dictionary, states, the, notion, of, sex, for, hire, is, not, inherent, in, the, etymology, which, rather, suggests, one, exposed, to, lust, or, sex, indiscriminately, offered, the, word, prostitute, was, then, carried, down, through, various, languages, to, the, present, day, western, society, most, sex, worker, activists, groups, reject, the, word, prostitute, and, since, the, late, 1970s, have, used, the, term, sex, worker, instead, however, sex, worker, can, also, mean, anyone, who, works, within, the, sex, industry, or, whose, work, is, of, a, sexual, nature, and, is, not, limited, solely, to, prostitutes, a, variety, of, terms, are, used, for, those, who, engage, in, prostitution, some, of, which, distinguish, between, different, types, of, prostitution, or, imply, a, value, judgment, about, them, this, terminology, is, hotly, contested, among, scholars, common, alternatives, for, prostitute, include, escort, and, whore, however, not, all, professional, escorts, are, prostitutes, the, english, word, whore, derives, from, the, old, english, word, h, ra, from, the, proto, germanic, h, r, n, prostitute, which, derives, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, keh, meaning, desire, a, root, which, has, also, given, us, latin, c, rus, dear, whence, the, french, cher, dear, expensive, and, the, latin, c, rit, s, love, charity, use, of, the, word, whore, is, widely, considered, pejorative, especially, in, its, modern, slang, form, of, ho, in, germany, however, most, prostitutes, organizations, deliberately, use, the, word, hure, whore, since, they, feel, that, prostitute, is, a, bureaucratic, term, those, seeking, to, remove, the, social, stigma, associated, with, prostitution, often, promote, terminology, such, as, sex, worker, commercial, sex, worker, csw, or, sex, trade, worker, another, commonly, used, word, for, a, prostitute, is, hooker, although, a, popular, etymology, connects, hooker, with, joseph, hooker, a, union, general, in, the, american, civil, war, the, word, more, likely, comes, from, the, concentration, of, prostitutes, around, the, shipyards, and, ferry, terminal, of, the, corlear, s, hook, area, of, manhattan, in, the, 1820s, who, came, to, be, referred, to, as, hookers, a, streetwalker, solicits, customers, on, the, streets, or, in, public, places, while, a, call, girl, makes, appointments, by, phone, or, in, recent, years, through, email, or, the, internet, correctly, or, not, the, use, of, the, word, prostitute, without, specifying, a, sex, may, commonly, be, assumed, to, be, female, compound, terms, such, as, male, prostitution, or, male, escort, are, therefore, often, used, to, identify, males, those, offering, services, to, female, customers, are, commonly, known, as, gigolos, those, offering, services, to, male, customers, are, hustlers, or, rent, boys, organizers, of, prostitution, may, be, known, colloquially, as, pimps, if, male, or, madams, if, female, more, formally, one, who, is, said, to, practice, procuring, is, a, procurer, or, procuress, they, may, also, be, called, panderers, or, brothel, keepers, examples, of, procuring, include, clients, of, prostitutes, most, often, men, by, prevalence, are, sometimes, known, as, johns, or, tricks, in, north, america, and, punters, in, britain, and, ireland, these, slang, terms, are, used, among, both, prostitutes, and, law, enforcement, for, persons, who, solicit, prostitutes, the, term, john, may, have, originated, from, the, frequent, customer, practice, of, giving, one, s, name, as, john, a, common, name, in, english, speaking, countries, in, an, effort, to, maintain, anonymity, in, some, places, men, who, drive, around, red, light, districts, for, the, purpose, of, soliciting, prostitutes, are, also, known, as, kerb, crawlers, female, clients, of, prostitutes, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, janes, or, sugar, mamas, the, word, prostitution, can, also, be, used, metaphorically, to, mean, debasing, oneself, or, working, towards, an, unworthy, cause, or, selling, out, in, this, sense, prostituting, oneself, or, whoring, oneself, the, services, or, acts, performed, are, typically, not, sexual, for, instance, in, the, book, the, catcher, in, the, rye, holden, caulfield, says, of, his, brother, d, b, now, he, s, out, in, hollywood, d, b, being, a, prostitute, if, there, s, one, thing, i, hate, it, s, the, movies, don, t, even, mention, them, to, me, d, b, is, not, literally, a, prostitute, holden, feels, that, his, job, writing, b, movie, screenplays, is, morally, debasing, the, prostitution, metaphor, traditionally, used, to, signify, political, inconstancy, unreliability, fickleness, a, lack, of, firm, values, and, integrity, and, venality, has, long, been, a, staple, of, russian, political, rhetoric, one, of, the, famous, insults, of, leon, trotsky, made, by, joseph, stalin, was, calling, him, a, political, prostitute, leon, trotsky, used, this, epithet, himself, calling, german, social, democracy, at, that, time, corrupted, by, kautskianism, a, political, prostitution, disguised, by, theories, in, 1938, he, used, the, same, description, for, the, comintern, saying, that, the, chief, aim, of, the, bonapartist, clique, of, stalin, during, the, preceding, several, years, has, consisted, in, proving, to, the, imperialist, democracies, its, wise, conservatism, and, love, for, order, for, the, sake, of, the, longed, alliance, with, imperialist, democracies, has, brought, the, comintern, to, the, last, stages, of, political, prostitution, besides, targeting, political, figures, the, term, is, used, in, relation, to, organizations, and, even, small, countries, which, have, no, choice, but, to, sell, themselves, because, their, voice, in, world, affairs, is, insignificant, in, 2007, a, russian, caricature, depicted, the, baltic, states, as, three, ladies, of, the, night, vying, for, the, attentions, of, uncle, sam, since, the, russian, client, has, run, out, of, money, usage, of, the, political, prostitute, moniker, is, by, no, means, unique, to, the, russian, political, lexicon, such, as, when, a, huffington, post, contributor, expressed, the, opinion, that, donald, trump, was, prostituting, himself, to, feed, his, ego, and, gain, power, when, he, ran, for, president, of, the, united, states, sex, work, researcher, and, writer, gail, pheterson, writes, that, these, metaphorical, usages, exist, because, the, term, prostitute, gradually, took, on, a, christian, moralist, tradition, as, being, synonymous, with, debasement, of, oneself, or, of, others, for, the, purpose, of, ill, gotten, gains, although, historically, it, was, suggested, that, peoples, of, the, ancient, near, east, engaged, in, sacred, prostitution, based, on, accounts, of, ancient, greek, authors, like, herodotus, the, veracity, of, these, claims, has, been, seriously, questioned, due, to, a, lack, of, corroborating, evidence, amongst, the, oldest, reliable, references, to, prostitution, in, ancient, greece, comes, from, the, archaic, era, poet, anacreon, c, 575, c, 495, bc, in, his, poem, about, artemon, which, references, whores, by, choice, the, record, of, prostitution, in, the, classical, period, is, better, documented, and, includes, references, to, both, free, born, voluntary, prostitutes, including, the, high, social, status, hetairai, as, well, as, involuntary, slave, prostitutes, male, prostitutes, also, existed, in, ancient, greece, there, was, never, a, unified, legal, approach, to, prostitution, in, ancient, rome, in, ancient, rome, prostitutes, had, low, social, status, and, were, considered, infamia, under, the, reign, of, emperor, caligula, a, taxation, on, prostitution, was, implemented, roman, slave, owners, were, able, to, include, the, ne, serva, prostituatur, covenant, as, part, of, slave, sale, contracts, which, prohibited, the, slaves, being, forced, to, prostitute, themselves, by, their, owners, after, being, sold, throughout, the, middle, ages, the, definition, of, a, prostitute, has, been, ambiguous, with, various, secular, and, canonical, organizations, defining, prostitution, in, constantly, evolving, terms, even, though, medieval, secular, authorities, created, legislation, to, deal, with, the, phenomenon, of, prostitution, they, rarely, attempted, to, define, what, a, prostitute, was, because, it, was, deemed, unnecessary, to, specify, exactly, who, fell, into, that, category, of, a, prostitute, the, first, known, definition, of, prostitution, was, found, in, marseille, s, thirteenth, century, statutes, which, included, a, chapter, entitled, de, meretricibus, regarding, prostitutes, the, marseillais, designated, prostitutes, as, public, girls, who, day, and, night, received, two, or, more, men, in, their, house, and, as, a, woman, who, did, business, trading, within, the, confine, of, a, brothel, a, fourteenth, century, english, tract, fasciculus, morum, states, that, the, term, prostitute, termed, meretrix, in, this, document, must, be, applied, only, to, those, women, who, give, themselves, to, anyone, and, will, refuse, none, and, that, for, monetary, gain, in, general, prostitution, was, not, typically, a, lifetime, career, choice, for, women, women, usually, alternated, their, career, of, prostitution, with, petty, retailing, and, victualing, or, only, occasionally, turned, to, prostitution, in, times, of, great, financial, need, women, who, became, prostitutes, often, did, not, have, the, familial, ties, or, means, to, protect, themselves, from, the, lure, of, prostitution, and, it, has, been, recorded, on, several, occasions, that, mothers, would, be, charged, with, prostituting, their, own, daughters, in, exchange, for, extra, money, medieval, civilians, accepted, without, question, the, fact, of, prostitution, it, was, a, necessary, part, of, medieval, life, prostitutes, subverted, the, sexual, tendencies, of, male, youth, just, by, existing, with, the, establishment, of, prostitution, men, were, less, likely, to, collectively, rape, honest, women, of, marriageable, and, re, marriageable, age, this, is, most, clearly, demonstrated, in, st, augustine, s, claim, that, the, removal, of, the, institution, would, bring, lust, into, all, aspects, of, the, world, meaning, that, without, prostitutes, to, subvert, male, tendencies, men, would, go, after, innocent, women, instead, thus, the, prostitutes, were, actually, doing, society, a, favor, according, to, augustine, in, urban, societies, there, was, an, erroneous, view, that, prostitution, was, flourishing, more, in, rural, regions, rather, than, in, cities, however, it, has, been, proven, that, prostitution, was, more, rampant, in, cities, and, large, towns, although, there, were, wandering, prostitutes, in, rural, areas, who, worked, according, to, the, calendar, of, fairs, similar, to, riding, a, circuit, in, which, prostitutes, stopped, by, various, towns, based, on, what, event, was, going, on, at, the, time, most, prostitutes, remained, in, cities, cities, tended, to, draw, more, prostitutes, due, to, the, sheer, size, of, the, population, and, the, institutionalization, of, prostitution, in, urban, areas, which, made, it, more, rampant, in, metropolitan, regions, furthermore, in, both, urban, and, rural, areas, of, society, women, who, did, not, live, under, the, rule, of, male, authority, were, more, likely, to, be, suspected, of, prostitution, than, their, oppressed, counterparts, because, of, the, fear, of, women, who, did, not, fit, into, a, stereotypical, category, outside, of, marriage, or, religious, life, secular, law, like, most, other, aspects, of, prostitution, in, the, middle, ages, is, difficult, to, generalize, due, to, the, regional, variations, in, attitudes, towards, prostitution, the, global, trend, of, the, thirteenth, century, was, toward, the, development, of, positive, policy, on, prostitution, as, laws, exiling, prostitutes, changed, towards, sumptuary, laws, and, the, confinement, of, prostitutes, to, red, light, districts, sumptuary, laws, became, the, regulatory, norm, for, prostitutes, and, included, making, courtesans, wear, a, shoulder, knot, of, a, particular, color, as, a, badge, of, their, calling, to, be, able, to, easily, distinguish, the, prostitute, from, a, respectable, woman, in, society, the, color, that, designated, them, as, prostitutes, could, vary, from, different, earth, tones, to, yellow, as, was, usually, designated, as, a, color, of, shame, in, the, hebrew, communities, these, laws, however, proved, no, impediment, to, wealthier, prostitutes, because, their, glamorous, appearances, were, almost, indistinguishable, from, noble, women, in, the, 14th, century, london, prostitutes, were, only, tolerated, when, they, wore, yellow, hoods, although, brothels, were, still, present, in, most, cities, and, urban, centers, and, could, range, from, private, bordelages, run, by, a, procuress, from, her, home, to, public, baths, and, centers, established, by, municipal, legislation, the, only, centers, for, prostitution, legally, allowed, were, the, institutionalized, and, publicly, funded, brothels, this, did, not, prevent, illegal, brothels, from, thriving, brothels, theoretically, banned, the, patronage, of, married, men, and, clergy, but, it, was, sporadically, enforced, and, there, is, evidence, of, clergymen, present, in, brawls, that, were, documented, in, brothels, thus, the, clergy, were, at, least, present, in, brothels, at, some, point, or, another, brothels, also, settled, the, obsessive, fear, of, the, sharing, of, women, and, solved, the, issue, of, collective, security, the, lives, of, prostitutes, in, brothels, were, not, cloistered, like, that, of, nuns, and, only, some, lived, permanently, in, the, streets, assigned, to, them, prostitutes, were, only, allowed, to, practice, their, trade, in, the, brothel, in, which, they, worked, brothels, were, also, used, to, protect, prostitutes, and, their, clients, through, various, regulations, for, example, the, law, that, forbid, brothel, keepers, beat, them, however, brothel, regulations, also, hindered, prostitutes, lives, by, forbidding, them, from, having, lovers, other, than, their, customers, or, from, having, a, favored, customer, courts, showed, conflicting, views, on, the, role, of, prostitutes, in, secular, law, as, prostitutes, could, not, inherit, property, defend, themselves, in, court, or, make, accusations, in, court, however, prostitutes, were, sometimes, called, upon, as, witnesses, during, trial, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, attitudes, seemed, to, have, begun, to, harden, against, prostitution, an, outbreak, of, syphilis, in, naples, 1494, which, later, swept, across, europe, and, which, may, have, originated, from, the, columbian, exchange, and, the, prevalence, of, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, from, the, earlier, 13th, century, may, have, been, causes, of, this, change, in, attitude, by, the, early, 16th, century, the, association, between, prostitutes, plague, and, contagion, emerged, causing, brothels, and, prostitution, to, be, outlawed, by, secular, authority, furthermore, outlawing, brothel, keeping, and, prostitution, was, also, used, to, strengthen, the, criminal, law, system, of, the, sixteenth, century, secular, rulers, canon, law, defined, a, prostitute, as, a, promiscuous, woman, regardless, of, financial, elements, the, prostitute, was, considered, a, whore, who, available, for, the, lust, of, many, men, and, was, most, closely, associated, with, promiscuity, the, church, s, stance, on, prostitution, was, three, fold, acceptance, of, prostitution, as, an, inevitable, social, fact, condemnation, of, those, profiting, from, this, commerce, and, encouragement, for, the, prostitute, to, repent, the, church, was, forced, to, recognize, its, inability, to, remove, prostitution, from, the, worldly, society, and, in, the, fourteenth, century, began, to, tolerate, prostitution, as, a, lesser, evil, however, prostitutes, were, to, be, excluded, from, the, church, as, long, as, they, practiced, around, the, twelfth, century, the, idea, of, prostitute, saints, took, hold, with, mary, magdalene, being, one, of, the, most, popular, saints, of, the, era, the, church, used, mary, magdalene, s, biblical, history, of, being, a, reformed, harlot, to, encourage, prostitutes, to, repent, and, mend, their, ways, simultaneously, religious, houses, were, established, with, the, purpose, of, providing, asylum, and, encouraging, the, reformation, of, prostitution, magdalene, homes, were, particularly, popular, and, peaked, especially, in, the, early, fourteenth, century, over, the, course, of, the, middle, ages, popes, and, religious, communities, made, various, attempts, to, remove, prostitution, or, reform, prostitutes, with, varying, success, with, the, advent, of, the, protestant, reformation, numbers, of, southern, german, towns, closed, their, brothels, in, an, attempt, to, eradicate, prostitution, in, some, periods, prostitutes, had, to, distinguish, themselves, by, particular, signs, sometimes, wearing, very, short, hair, or, no, hair, at, all, or, wearing, veils, in, societies, where, other, women, did, not, wear, them, ancient, codes, regulated, in, this, case, the, crime, of, a, prostitute, that, dissimulated, her, profession, in, some, cultures, prostitutes, were, the, sole, women, allowed, to, sing, in, public, or, act, in, theatrical, performances, in, the, 19th, century, legalized, prostitution, became, the, center, of, public, controversy, as, the, british, government, passed, the, contagious, diseases, acts, legislation, mandating, pelvic, examinations, for, suspected, prostitutes, they, would, remain, in, force, until, 1886, the, french, government, instead, of, trying, to, outlaw, prostitution, began, to, view, prostitution, as, a, necessary, evil, for, society, to, function, french, politicians, chose, to, regulate, prostitution, introducing, a, morals, brigade, onto, the, streets, of, paris, a, similar, situation, did, in, fact, exist, in, the, russian, empire, prostitutes, operating, out, of, government, sanctioned, brothels, were, given, yellow, internal, passports, signifying, their, status, and, were, subjected, to, weekly, physical, exams, a, major, work, prostitution, considered, in, its, moral, social, and, sanitary, aspects, was, published, by, william, acton, in, 1857, which, estimated, that, the, county, of, london, had, 80, 000, prostitutes, and, that, 1, house, in, 60, was, serving, as, a, brothel, leo, tolstoy, s, novel, resurrection, describes, legal, prostitution, in, 19th, century, russia, the, leading, marxist, theorists, opposed, prostitution, communist, governments, often, attempted, to, repress, the, practice, immediately, after, obtaining, power, although, it, always, persisted, in, most, contemporary, communist, states, prostitution, remained, illegal, but, was, nonetheless, common, the, economic, decline, brought, about, by, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, led, to, increased, prostitution, in, many, current, and, former, communist, countries, in, 1956, the, united, kingdom, introduced, the, sexual, offences, act, 1956, while, this, law, did, not, criminalise, the, act, of, prostitution, in, the, united, kingdom, itself, it, prohibited, such, activities, as, running, a, brothel, soliciting, was, made, illegal, by, the, street, offences, act, 1959, these, laws, were, partly, repealed, and, altered, by, the, sexual, offences, act, 2003, and, the, policing, and, crime, act, 2009, since, the, break, up, of, the, soviet, union, thousands, of, eastern, european, women, end, up, as, prostitutes, in, china, western, europe, israel, and, turkey, every, year, some, enter, the, profession, willingly, many, are, tricked, coerced, or, kidnapped, and, often, experience, captivity, and, violence, there, are, tens, of, thousands, of, women, from, eastern, europe, and, asia, working, as, prostitutes, in, dubai, men, from, saudi, arabia, and, the, united, arab, emirates, form, a, large, proportion, of, the, customers, in, the, islamic, world, sex, outside, of, marriage, was, normally, acquired, by, men, not, by, paying, for, temporary, sex, from, a, free, sex, worker, but, rather, by, personal, sex, slave, called, concubine, which, was, a, sex, slave, trade, that, was, still, ongoing, in, the, early, 20th, century, traditionally, prostitution, in, the, islamic, world, was, historically, practiced, by, way, of, the, pimp, temporarily, selling, his, slave, to, her, client, who, then, returned, the, ownership, of, the, slave, after, intercourse, the, islamic, law, formally, prohibited, prostitution, however, since, islamic, law, allowed, a, man, to, have, sexual, intercourse, with, his, slave, concubine, prostitution, was, practiced, by, a, pimp, selling, his, female, slave, on, the, slave, market, to, a, client, who, returned, his, ownership, on, the, pretext, of, discontent, after, having, had, intercourse, with, her, which, was, a, legal, and, accepted, method, for, prostitution, in, the, islamic, world, this, form, of, prostitution, was, practiced, by, for, example, ibn, batuta, who, acquired, several, female, slaves, during, his, travels, according, to, shia, muslims, muhammad, sanctioned, fixed, term, marriage, muta, a, in, iraq, and, sigheh, in, iran, which, has, instead, been, used, as, a, legitimizing, cover, for, sex, workers, in, a, culture, where, prostitution, is, otherwise, forbidden, sunni, muslims, who, make, up, the, majority, of, muslims, worldwide, believe, the, practice, of, fixed, term, marriage, was, abrogated, and, ultimately, forbidden, by, either, muhammad, or, one, of, his, successors, umar, sunnis, regard, prostitution, as, sinful, and, forbidden, some, writers, have, argued, that, mut, ah, and, nikah, misyar, approximate, prostitution, julie, parshall, writes, that, mut, ah, is, legalised, prostitution, which, has, been, sanctioned, by, the, twelver, shia, authorities, she, quotes, the, oxford, encyclopedia, of, modern, islamic, world, to, differentiate, between, marriage, nikah, and, mut, ah, and, states, that, while, nikah, is, for, procreation, mut, ah, is, just, for, sexual, gratification, according, to, zeyno, baran, this, kind, of, temporary, marriage, provides, shi, ite, men, with, a, religiously, sanctioned, equivalent, to, prostitution, according, to, elena, andreeva, s, observation, published, in, 2007, russian, travellers, to, iran, consider, mut, ah, to, be, legalized, profligacy, which, is, indistinguishable, from, prostitution, religious, supporters, of, mut, ah, argue, that, temporary, marriage, is, different, from, prostitution, for, a, couple, of, reasons, including, the, necessity, of, iddah, in, case, the, couple, have, sexual, intercourse, it, means, that, if, a, woman, marries, a, man, in, this, way, and, has, sex, she, has, to, wait, for, a, number, of, months, before, marrying, again, and, therefore, a, woman, cannot, marry, more, than, 3, or, 4, times, in, a, year, according, to, dervish, ismail, agha, in, the, dell, kname, i, dilk, the, ottoman, archives, in, the, hammams, the, masseurs, were, traditionally,

levels, have, fallen, in, sexually, liberal, countries, most, likely, because, of, the, increased, availability, of, non, commercial, non, marital, sex, or, for, example, in, sweden, because, of, stricter, legal, penalties, other, reports, suggest, a, growth, in, prostitution, levels, for, example, in, the, us, where, again, sexual, liberalisation, is, suggested, as, the, cause, as, norma, ramos, executive, director, of, the, coalition, against, trafficking, in, women, says, the, more, the, commercial, sex, industry, normalizes, this, behavior, the, more, of, this, behavior, you, get, prostitutes, have, long, plied, their, trades, to, the, military, in, many, cultures, for, example, the, british, naval, port, of, portsmouth, had, a, flourishing, local, sex, industry, in, the, 19th,

civil, war, street, prostitutes, are, at, higher, risk, of, violent, crime, than, brothel, prostitutes, and, bar, prostitutes, in, the, united, states, the, homicide, rate, for, female, prostitutes, was, estimated, to, be, 204, per, 100, 000, there, are, substantial, differences, in, rates, of, victimization, between, street, prostitutes, and, indoor, prostitutes, who, work, as, escorts, call, girls, or, in, brothels, and, massage, parlors, violence, against, male, prostitutes, is, less, common, the, call, to, decriminalize, selling, sex, is, in, part, to, reduce, harm, and, violence, under, criminalization, prostitutes, become, more, vulnerable, to, be, victims, of, crimes, even, by, serial, killers, because, those, committing, crimes, know, that, prostitutes, would, be, less, likely, to, report, such, crimes, to, the, police, as, they, would, risk, arrest, additionally, this, puts, prostitutes, at, risk, of, violence, by, police, as, police, are, able, to, extort, prostitutes, by, threatening, arrest, the, aclu, human, rights, watch, and, amnesty, international, argue, that, in, addition, to, decriminalize, selling, sex, as, in, the, nordic, model, decriminalizing, buying, sex, makes, it, more, safer, for, prostitutes, in, some, places, prostitution, may, be, associated, with, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, lack, of, condom, use, among, prostitutes, and, their, clients, has, been, cited, as, a, factor, in, the, spread, of, hiv, in, asia, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, rapid, spread, of, hiv, in, asian, countries, is, the, massive, transmission, among, sex, workers, and, clients, as, a, result, prevention, campaigns, aimed, at, increasing, condom, use, by, sex, workers, have, been, attributed, to, play, a, major, role, in, restricting, the, spread, of, hiv, one, of, the, sources, for, the, spread, of, hiv, in, africa, is, prostitution, with, one, study, finding, that, encounters, with, prostitutes, produced, 84, of, new, hiv, infections, in, adult, males, in, accra, ghana, the, spread, of, hiv, from, urban, settings, to, rural, areas, in, africa, has, been, attributed, to, the, mobility, of, farmers, who, visit, sex, workers, in, cities, for, example, in, ethiopia, some, studies, of, prostitution, in, urban, settings, in, developing, countries, such, as, kenya, have, stated, that, prostitution, acts, as, a, reservoir, of, stis, within, the, general, population, typical, responses, to, the, problem, are, some, think, that, the, first, two, measures, are, counter, productive, banning, prostitution, tends, to, drive, it, underground, making, safe, sex, promotion, treatment, and, monitoring, more, difficult, registering, prostitutes, makes, the, state, complicit, in, prostitution, and, does, not, address, the, health, risks, of, unregistered, prostitutes, both, of, the, last, two, measures, can, be, viewed, as, harm, reduction, policies, in, countries, and, areas, where, safer, sex, precautions, are, either, unavailable, or, not, practiced, for, cultural, reasons, prostitution, is, an, active, disease, vector, for, all, stis, including, hiv, aids, but, the, encouragement, of, safer, sex, practices, combined, with, regular, testing, for, sexually, transmitted, infections, has, been, very, successful, when, applied, consistently, as, an, example, thailand, s, condom, program, has, been, largely, responsible, for, the, country, s, progress, against, the, hiv, epidemic, it, has, been, estimated, that, successful, implementation, of, safe, sex, practices, in, india, would, drive, the, epidemic, to, extinction, while, similar, measures, could, achieve, a, 50, reduction, in, botswana, in, 2009, un, secretary, general, ban, ki, moon, urged, all, countries, to, remove, bans, on, prostitution, and, homosexual, sex, because, such, laws, constitute, major, barriers, to, reaching, key, populations, with, hiv, services, in, 2012, the, global, commission, on, hiv, and, the, law, which, was, convened, by, ban, ki, moon, and, which, is, an, independent, body, was, established, at, the, request, of, the, unaids, and, supported, by, a, secretariat, based, at, the, undp, reached, the, same, conclusions, also, recommending, decriminalization, of, brothels, and, procuring, nevertheless, the, report, states, that, the, content, analysis, opinions, and, policy, recommendations, contained, in, this, publication, do, not, necessarily, reflect, the, views, of, the, united, nations, development, programme, the, covid, 19, pandemic, has, had, an, impact, on, sex, work, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, contact, professions, which, includes, prostitution, amongst, others, had, been, banned, temporarily, in, some, countries, this, has, resulted, in, a, local, reduction, of, prostitution, de, marneffe, 2009, argued, that, there, are, psychological, issues, that, prostitutes, face, from, certain, experiences, and, through, the, duration, or, repetition, some, go, through, experiences, that, may, result, in, lasting, feelings, of, worthlessness, shame, and, self, hatred, de, marneffe, further, argued, that, this, may, affect, the, prostitute, s, ability, to, perform, sexual, acts, for, the, purpose, of, building, a, trusting, intimate, relationship, which, may, be, important, for, their, partner, the, lack, of, a, healthy, relationship, can, lead, to, higher, divorce, rates, and, can, influence, unhealthy, relationship, to, their, children, influencing, their, future, relationships, notes,
