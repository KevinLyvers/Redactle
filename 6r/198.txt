twins, are, two, offspring, produced, by, the, same, pregnancy, twins, can, be, either, monozygotic, identical, meaning, that, they, develop, from, one, zygote, which, splits, and, forms, two, embryos, or, dizygotic, non, identical, or, fraternal, meaning, that, each, twin, develops, from, a, separate, egg, and, each, egg, is, fertilized, by, its, own, sperm, cell, since, identical, twins, develop, from, one, zygote, they, will, share, the, same, sex, while, fraternal, twins, may, or, may, not, in, very, rare, cases, twins, can, have, the, same, mother, and, different, fathers, heteropaternal, superfecundation, in, contrast, a, fetus, that, develops, alone, in, the, womb, the, much, more, common, case, in, humans, is, called, a, singleton, and, the, general, term, for, one, offspring, of, a, multiple, birth, is, a, multiple, unrelated, look, alikes, whose, resemblance, parallels, that, of, twins, are, referred, to, as, doppelg, nger, the, human, twin, birth, rate, in, the, united, states, rose, 76, from, 1980, through, 2009, from, 9, 4, to, 16, 7, twin, sets, 18, 8, to, 33, 3, twins, per, 1, 000, births, the, yoruba, people, have, the, highest, rate, of, twinning, in, the, world, at, 45, 50, twin, sets, 90, 100, twins, per, 1, 000, live, births, possibly, because, of, high, consumption, of, a, specific, type, of, yam, containing, a, natural, phytoestrogen, which, may, stimulate, the, ovaries, to, release, an, egg, from, each, side, in, central, africa, there, are, 18, 30, twin, sets, or, 36, 60, twins, per, 1, 000, live, births, in, south, america, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, the, lowest, rates, are, found, only, 6, to, 9, twin, sets, per, 1, 000, live, births, north, america, and, europe, have, intermediate, rates, of, 9, to, 16, twin, sets, per, 1, 000, live, births, multiple, pregnancies, are, much, less, likely, to, carry, to, full, term, than, single, births, with, twin, pregnancies, lasting, on, average, 37, weeks, three, weeks, less, than, full, term, women, who, have, a, family, history, of, fraternal, twins, have, a, higher, chance, of, producing, fraternal, twins, themselves, as, there, is, a, genetically, linked, tendency, to, hyper, ovulate, there, is, no, known, genetic, link, for, identical, twinning, other, factors, that, increase, the, odds, of, having, fraternal, twins, include, maternal, age, fertility, drugs, and, other, fertility, treatments, nutrition, and, prior, births, some, women, intentionally, turn, to, fertility, drugs, in, order, to, conceive, twins, the, vast, majority, of, twins, are, either, dizygotic, fraternal, or, monozygotic, identical, in, humans, dizygotic, twins, occur, more, often, than, monozygotic, twins, less, common, variants, are, discussed, further, down, the, article, fraternal, twins, can, be, any, of, the, following, among, non, twin, births, male, singletons, are, slightly, about, five, percent, more, common, than, female, singletons, the, rates, for, singletons, vary, slightly, by, country, for, example, the, sex, ratio, of, birth, in, the, us, is, 1, 05, males, female, while, it, is, 1, 07, males, female, in, italy, however, males, are, also, more, susceptible, than, females, to, die, in, utero, and, since, the, death, rate, in, utero, is, higher, for, twins, it, leads, to, female, twins, being, more, common, than, male, twins, zygosity, is, the, degree, of, identity, in, the, genome, of, twins, dizygotic, dz, or, fraternal, twins, also, referred, to, as, non, identical, twins, dissimilar, twins, biovular, twins, and, informally, in, the, case, of, females, sororal, twins, usually, occur, when, two, fertilized, eggs, are, implanted, in, the, uterus, wall, at, the, same, time, when, two, eggs, are, independently, fertilized, by, two, different, sperm, cells, fraternal, twins, result, the, two, eggs, or, ova, form, two, zygotes, hence, the, terms, dizygotic, and, biovular, fraternal, twins, are, essentially, two, ordinary, siblings, who, happen, to, develop, in, the, womb, together, and, who, are, born, at, the, same, time, since, they, arise, from, two, separate, eggs, fertilized, by, two, separate, sperm, just, like, ordinary, siblings, this, is, the, most, common, type, of, twin, dizygotic, twins, like, any, other, siblings, will, practically, always, have, different, sequences, on, each, chromosome, due, to, chromosomal, crossover, during, meiosis, dizygotic, twins, share, on, average, 50, percent, of, each, other, s, genes, the, same, as, siblings, that, are, conceived, and, born, at, different, times, like, any, other, siblings, dizygotic, twins, may, look, similar, particularly, as, they, are, the, same, age, however, dizygotic, twins, may, also, look, very, different, from, each, other, for, example, be, of, opposite, sexes, studies, show, that, there, is, a, genetic, proclivity, for, dizygotic, twinning, however, it, is, only, the, mother, who, has, any, effect, on, the, chances, of, having, such, twins, there, is, no, known, mechanism, for, a, father, to, cause, the, release, of, more, than, one, ovum, dizygotic, twinning, ranges, from, six, per, thousand, births, in, japan, similar, to, the, rate, of, monozygotic, twins, to, 14, and, more, per, thousand, in, some, african, countries, dizygotic, twins, are, also, more, common, for, older, mothers, with, twinning, rates, doubling, in, mothers, over, the, age, of, 35, with, the, advent, of, technologies, and, techniques, to, assist, women, in, getting, pregnant, the, rate, of, fraternals, has, increased, markedly, monozygotic, mz, or, identical, twins, occur, when, a, single, egg, is, fertilized, to, form, one, zygote, hence, monozygotic, which, then, divides, into, two, separate, embryos, the, chances, of, having, identical, twins, is, relatively, rare, around, 3, or, 4, in, every, 1, 000, births, regarding, spontaneous, or, natural, monozygotic, twinning, a, 2007, theory, related, to, in, vitro, fertilization, ivf, proposes, that, monozygotic, twins, may, be, formed, when, a, blastocyst, contains, two, inner, cell, masses, icm, each, of, which, will, lead, to, a, separate, fetus, rather, than, by, the, embryo, splitting, while, hatching, from, the, zona, pellucida, the, gelatinous, protective, coating, around, the, blastocyst, monozygotic, twins, may, also, be, created, artificially, by, embryo, splitting, it, can, be, used, as, an, expansion, of, in, vitro, fertilization, ivf, to, increase, the, number, of, available, embryos, for, embryo, transfer, monozygotic, twinning, occurs, in, birthing, at, a, rate, of, about, 3, in, every, 1000, deliveries, worldwide, the, likelihood, of, a, single, fertilization, resulting, in, monozygotic, twins, is, uniformly, distributed, in, all, populations, around, the, world, this, is, in, marked, contrast, to, dizygotic, twinning, which, ranges, from, about, six, per, thousand, births, in, japan, almost, similar, to, the, rate, of, identical, twins, which, is, around, 4, 5, to, 15, and, more, per, thousand, in, some, parts, of, india, and, up, to, over, 20, in, some, central, african, countries, the, exact, cause, for, the, splitting, of, a, zygote, or, embryo, is, unknown, ivf, techniques, are, more, likely, to, create, dizygotic, twins, for, ivf, deliveries, there, are, nearly, 21, pairs, of, twins, for, every, 1, 000, monozygotic, twins, are, genetically, nearly, identical, and, they, are, the, same, chromosomal, sex, unless, there, has, been, a, mutation, during, development, the, children, of, monozygotic, twins, test, genetically, as, half, siblings, or, full, siblings, if, a, pair, of, monozygotic, twins, reproduces, with, another, pair, or, with, the, same, person, rather, than, first, cousins, identical, twins, do, not, have, the, same, fingerprints, however, because, even, within, the, confines, of, the, womb, the, fetuses, touch, different, parts, of, their, environment, giving, rise, to, small, variations, in, their, corresponding, prints, and, thus, making, them, unique, monozygotic, twins, always, have, the, same, genotype, normally, due, to, an, environmental, factor, or, the, deactivation, of, different, x, chromosomes, in, female, monozygotic, twins, and, in, some, extremely, rare, cases, due, to, aneuploidy, twins, may, express, different, sexual, phenotypes, normally, from, an, xxy, klinefelter, syndrome, zygote, splitting, unevenly, monozygotic, twins, although, genetically, very, similar, are, not, genetically, exactly, the, same, the, dna, in, white, blood, cells, of, 66, pairs, of, monozygotic, twins, was, analyzed, for, 506, 786, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, known, to, occur, in, human, populations, polymorphisms, appeared, in, 2, of, the, 33, million, comparisons, leading, the, researchers, to, extrapolate, that, the, blood, cells, of, monozygotic, twins, may, have, on, the, order, of, one, dna, sequence, difference, for, every, 12, million, nucleotides, which, would, imply, hundreds, of, differences, across, the, entire, genome, the, mutations, producing, the, differences, detected, in, this, study, would, have, occurred, during, embryonic, cell, division, after, the, point, of, fertilization, if, they, occur, early, in, fetal, development, they, will, be, present, in, a, very, large, proportion, of, body, cells, another, cause, of, difference, between, monozygotic, twins, is, epigenetic, modification, caused, by, differing, environmental, influences, throughout, their, lives, epigenetics, refers, to, the, level, of, activity, of, any, particular, gene, a, gene, may, become, switched, on, switched, off, or, could, become, partially, switched, on, or, off, in, an, individual, this, epigenetic, modification, is, triggered, by, environmental, events, monozygotic, twins, can, have, markedly, different, epigenetic, profiles, a, study, of, 80, pairs, of, monozygotic, twins, ranging, in, age, from, three, to, 74, showed, that, the, youngest, twins, have, relatively, few, epigenetic, differences, the, number, of, epigenetic, differences, increases, with, age, fifty, year, old, twins, had, over, three, times, the, epigenetic, difference, of, three, year, old, twins, twins, who, had, spent, their, lives, apart, such, as, those, adopted, by, two, different, sets, of, parents, at, birth, had, the, greatest, difference, however, certain, characteristics, become, more, alike, as, twins, age, such, as, iq, and, personality, in, january, 2021, new, research, from, a, team, of, researchers, in, iceland, was, published, in, the, journal, nature, genetics, suggesting, that, identical, twins, may, not, be, quite, as, identical, as, previously, thought, the, four, year, study, of, monozygotic, identical, twins, and, their, extended, families, revealed, that, these, twins, have, genetic, differences, that, begin, in, the, early, stages, of, embryonic, development, a, 1981, study, of, a, deceased, xxx, twin, fetus, without, a, heart, showed, that, although, its, fetal, development, suggested, that, it, was, an, identical, twin, as, it, shared, a, placenta, with, its, healthy, twin, tests, revealed, that, it, was, probably, a, polar, body, twin, the, authors, were, unable, to, predict, whether, a, healthy, fetus, could, result, from, a, polar, body, twinning, however, a, study, in, 2012, found, that, it, is, possible, for, a, polar, body, to, result, in, a, healthy, fetus, in, 2003, a, study, argued, that, many, cases, of, triploidy, arise, from, sesquizygotic, semi, identical, twinning, which, happens, when, a, single, egg, is, fertilized, by, two, sperm, and, splits, the, three, sets, of, chromosomes, into, two, separate, cell, sets, the, degree, of, separation, of, the, twins, in, utero, depends, on, if, and, when, they, split, into, two, zygotes, dizygotic, twins, were, always, two, zygotes, monozygotic, twins, split, into, two, zygotes, at, some, time, very, early, in, the, pregnancy, the, timing, of, this, separation, determines, the, chorionicity, the, number, of, placentae, and, amniocity, the, number, of, sacs, of, the, pregnancy, dichorionic, twins, either, never, divided, i, e, were, dizygotic, or, they, divided, within, the, first, 4, days, monoamnionic, twins, divide, after, the, first, week, in, very, rare, cases, twins, become, conjoined, twins, non, conjoined, monozygotic, twins, form, up, to, day, 14, of, embryonic, development, but, when, twinning, occurs, after, 14, days, the, twins, will, likely, be, conjoined, furthermore, there, can, be, various, degrees, of, shared, environment, of, twins, in, the, womb, potentially, leading, to, pregnancy, complications, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, two, placentas, automatically, implies, dizygotic, twins, but, if, monozygotic, twins, separate, early, enough, the, arrangement, of, sacs, and, placentas, in, utero, is, in, fact, indistinguishable, from, that, of, dizygotic, twins, didi, twins, have, the, lowest, mortality, risk, at, about, 9, percent, although, that, is, still, significantly, higher, than, that, of, singletons, monochorionic, twins, generally, have, two, amniotic, sacs, called, monochorionic, diamniotic, modi, which, occurs, in, 60, 70, of, the, pregnancies, with, monozygotic, twins, and, in, 0, 3, of, all, pregnancies, monochorionic, diamniotic, twins, are, almost, always, monozygotic, with, a, few, exceptions, where, the, blastocysts, have, fused, monochorionic, twins, share, the, same, placenta, and, thus, have, a, risk, of, twin, to, twin, transfusion, syndrome, monoamniotic, twins, are, always, monozygotic, the, survival, rate, for, monoamniotic, twins, is, somewhere, between, 50, and, 60, monoamniotic, twins, as, with, diamniotic, monochorionic, twins, have, a, risk, of, twin, to, twin, transfusion, syndrome, also, the, two, umbilical, cords, have, an, increased, chance, of, being, tangled, around, the, babies, because, of, this, there, is, an, increased, chance, that, the, newborns, may, be, miscarried, or, suffer, from, cerebral, palsy, due, to, lack, of, oxygen, when, the, division, of, the, developing, zygote, into, 2, embryos, occurs, 99, of, the, time, it, is, within, 8, days, of, fertilization, mortality, is, highest, for, conjoined, twins, due, to, the, many, complications, resulting, from, shared, organs, a, 2006, study, has, found, that, insulin, like, growth, factor, present, in, dairy, products, may, increase, the, chance, of, dizygotic, twinning, specifically, the, study, found, that, vegan, mothers, who, exclude, dairy, from, their, diets, are, one, fifth, as, likely, to, have, twins, as, vegetarian, or, omnivore, mothers, and, concluded, that, genotypes, favoring, elevated, igf, and, diets, including, dairy, products, especially, in, areas, where, growth, hormone, is, given, to, cattle, appear, to, enhance, the, chances, of, multiple, pregnancies, due, to, ovarian, stimulation, from, 1980, to, 1997, the, number, of, twin, births, in, the, united, states, rose, 52, this, rise, can, at, least, partly, be, attributed, to, the, increasing, popularity, of, fertility, drugs, and, procedures, such, as, ivf, which, result, in, multiple, births, more, frequently, than, unassisted, fertilizations, do, it, may, also, be, linked, to, the, increase, of, growth, hormones, in, food, about, 1, in, 90, human, births, 1, 1, results, from, a, twin, pregnancy, the, rate, of, dizygotic, twinning, varies, greatly, among, ethnic, groups, ranging, as, high, as, about, 45, per, 1000, births, 4, 5, for, the, yoruba, to, 10, for, linha, s, o, pedro, a, tiny, brazilian, settlement, which, belongs, to, the, city, of, c, ndido, god, i, in, c, ndido, god, i, one, in, five, pregnancies, has, resulted, in, twins, the, argentine, historian, jorge, camarasa, has, put, forward, the, theory, that, experiments, of, the, nazi, doctor, josef, mengele, could, be, responsible, for, the, high, ratio, of, twins, in, the, area, his, theory, was, rejected, by, brazilian, scientists, who, had, studied, twins, living, in, linha, s, o, pedro, they, suggested, genetic, factors, within, that, community, as, a, more, likely, explanation, a, high, twinning, rate, has, also, been, observed, in, other, places, of, the, world, including, the, widespread, use, of, fertility, drugs, causing, hyperovulation, stimulated, release, of, multiple, eggs, by, the, mother, has, caused, what, some, call, an, epidemic, of, multiple, births, in, 2001, for, the, first, time, ever, in, the, us, the, twinning, rate, exceeded, 3, of, all, births, nevertheless, the, rate, of, monozygotic, twins, remains, at, about, 1, in, 333, across, the, globe, in, a, study, on, the, maternity, records, of, 5750, hausa, women, living, in, the, savannah, zone, of, nigeria, there, were, 40, twins, and, 2, triplets, per, 1000, births, twenty, six, percent, of, twins, were, monozygotic, the, incidence, of, multiple, births, which, was, about, five, times, higher, than, that, observed, in, any, western, population, was, significantly, lower, than, that, of, other, ethnic, groups, who, live, in, the, hot, and, humid, climate, of, the, southern, part, of, the, country, the, incidence, of, multiple, births, was, related, to, maternal, age, but, did, not, bear, any, association, to, the, climate, or, prevalence, of, malaria, twins, are, more, common, in, people, of, african, descent, the, predisposing, factors, of, monozygotic, twinning, are, unknown, dizygotic, twin, pregnancies, are, slightly, more, likely, when, the, following, factors, are, present, in, the, woman, women, undergoing, certain, fertility, treatments, may, have, a, greater, chance, of, dizygotic, multiple, births, in, the, united, states, it, has, been, estimated, that, by, 2011, 36, of, twin, births, resulted, from, conception, by, assisted, reproductive, technology, the, risk, of, twin, birth, can, vary, depending, on, what, types, of, fertility, treatments, are, used, with, in, vitro, fertilisation, ivf, this, is, primarily, due, to, the, insertion, of, multiple, embryos, into, the, uterus, ovarian, hyperstimulation, without, ivf, has, a, very, high, risk, of, multiple, birth, reversal, of, anovulation, with, clomifene, trade, names, including, clomid, has, a, relatively, less, but, yet, significant, risk, of, multiple, pregnancy, a, 15, year, german, study, of, 8, 220, vaginally, delivered, twins, that, is, 4, 110, pregnancies, in, hesse, yielded, a, mean, delivery, time, interval, of, 13, 5, minutes, the, delivery, interval, between, the, twins, was, measured, as, follows, the, study, stated, that, the, occurrence, of, complications, was, found, to, be, more, likely, with, increasing, twin, to, twin, delivery, time, interval, and, suggested, that, the, interval, be, kept, short, though, it, noted, that, the, study, did, not, examine, causes, of, complications, and, did, not, control, for, factors, such, as, the, level, of, experience, of, the, obstetrician, the, wish, of, the, women, giving, birth, or, the, management, strategies, of, the, procedure, of, delivering, the, second, twin, there, have, also, been, cases, in, which, twins, are, born, a, number, of, days, apart, possibly, the, worldwide, record, for, the, duration, of, the, time, gap, between, the, first, and, the, second, delivery, was, the, birth, of, twins, 97, days, apart, in, cologne, germany, the, first, of, which, was, born, on, november, 17, 2018, researchers, suspect, that, as, many, as, 1, in, 8, pregnancies, start, out, as, multiples, but, only, a, single, fetus, is, brought, to, full, term, because, the, other, fetus, has, died, very, early, in, the, pregnancy, and, has, not, been, detected, or, recorded, early, obstetric, ultrasonography, exams, sometimes, reveal, an, extra, fetus, which, fails, to, develop, and, instead, disintegrates, and, vanishes, in, the, uterus, there, are, several, reasons, for, the, vanishing, fetus, including, it, being, embodied, or, absorbed, by, the, other, fetus, placenta, or, the, mother, this, is, known, as, vanishing, twin, syndrome, also, in, an, unknown, proportion, of, cases, two, zygotes, may, fuse, soon, after, fertilization, resulting, in, a, single, chimeric, embryo, and, later, fetus, conjoined, twins, or, the, once, commonly, used, term, siamese, are, monozygotic, twins, whose, bodies, are, joined, during, pregnancy, this, occurs, when, the, zygote, starts, to, split, after, day, 12, following, fertilization, and, fails, to, separate, completely, this, condition, occurs, in, about, 1, in, 50, 000, human, pregnancies, most, conjoined, twins, are, now, evaluated, for, surgery, to, attempt, to, separate, them, into, separate, functional, bodies, the, degree, of, difficulty, rises, if, a, vital, organ, or, structure, is, shared, between, twins, such, as, the, brain, heart, liver, or, lungs, a, chimera, is, an, ordinary, person, or, animal, except, that, some, of, their, parts, actually, came, from, their, twin, or, from, the, mother, a, chimera, may, arise, either, from, monozygotic, twin, fetuses, where, it, would, be, impossible, to, detect, or, from, dizygotic, fetuses, which, can, be, identified, by, chromosomal, comparisons, from, various, parts, of, the, body, the, number, of, cells, derived, from, each, fetus, can, vary, from, one, part, of, the, body, to, another, and, often, leads, to, characteristic, mosaicism, skin, coloration, in, human, chimeras, a, chimera, may, be, intersex, composed, of, cells, from, a, male, twin, and, a, female, twin, in, one, case, dna, tests, determined, that, a, woman, lydia, fairchild, mystifyingly, was, not, the, mother, of, two, of, her, three, children, she, was, found, to, be, a, chimera, and, the, two, children, were, conceived, from, eggs, derived, from, cells, of, their, mother, s, twin, sometimes, one, twin, fetus, will, fail, to, develop, completely, and, continue, to, cause, problems, for, its, surviving, twin, one, fetus, acts, as, a, parasite, towards, the, other, sometimes, the, parasitic, twin, becomes, an, almost, indistinguishable, part, of, the, other, and, sometimes, this, needs, to, be, treated, medically, a, very, rare, type, of, parasitic, twinning, is, one, where, a, single, viable, twin, is, endangered, when, the, other, zygote, becomes, cancerous, or, molar, this, means, that, the, molar, zygote, s, cellular, division, continues, unchecked, resulting, in, a, cancerous, growth, that, overtakes, the, viable, fetus, typically, this, results, when, one, twin, has, either, triploidy, or, complete, paternal, uniparental, disomy, resulting, in, little, or, no, fetus, and, a, cancerous, overgrown, placenta, resembling, a, bunch, of, grapes, occasionally, a, woman, will, suffer, a, miscarriage, early, in, pregnancy, yet, the, pregnancy, will, continue, one, twin, was, miscarried, but, the, other, was, able, to, be, carried, to, term, this, occurrence, is, similar, to, the, vanishing, twin, syndrome, but, typically, occurs, later, as, the, twin, is, not, reabsorbed, it, is, very, common, for, twins, to, be, born, at, a, low, birth, weight, more, than, half, of, twins, are, born, weighing, less, than, 5, 5, pounds, 2, 5, kg, while, the, average, birth, weight, of, a, healthy, baby, should, be, around, 6, 8, pounds, 3, 4, kg, this, is, largely, due, to, the, fact, that, twins, are, typically, born, premature, premature, birth, and, low, birth, weights, especially, when, under, 3, 5, pounds, 1, 6, kg, can, increase, the, risk, of, several, health, related, issues, such, as, vision, and, hearing, loss, mental, disabilities, and, cerebral, palsy, there, is, an, increased, possibility, of, potential, complications, as, the, birth, weight, of, the, baby, decreases, monozygotic, twins, who, share, a, placenta, can, develop, twin, to, twin, transfusion, syndrome, this, condition, means, that, blood, from, one, twin, is, being, diverted, into, the, other, twin, one, twin, the, donor, twin, is, small, and, anemic, the, other, the, recipient, twin, is, large, and, polycythemic, the, lives, of, both, twins, are, endangered, by, this, condition, stillbirths, occurs, when, a, fetus, dies, after, 20, weeks, of, gestation, there, are, two, types, of, stillbirth, including, intrauterine, death, and, intrapartum, death, intrauterine, death, occurs, when, a, baby, dies, during, late, pregnancy, intrapartum, death, which, is, more, common, occurs, when, a, baby, dies, while, the, mother, is, giving, birth, the, cause, of, stillbirth, is, often, unknown, but, the, rate, of, babies, who, are, stillborn, is, higher, in, twins, and, multiple, births, caesareans, or, inductions, are, advised, after, 38, weeks, of, pregnancy, for, twins, because, the, risk, of, stillbirth, increases, after, this, time, heterotopic, pregnancy, is, an, exceedingly, rare, type, of, dizygotic, twinning, in, which, one, twin, implants, in, the, uterus, as, normal, and, the, other, remains, in, the, fallopian, tube, as, an, ectopic, pregnancy, ectopic, pregnancies, must, be, resolved, because, they, can, be, life, threatening, to, the, mother, however, in, most, cases, the, intrauterine, pregnancy, can, be, salvaged, for, otherwise, healthy, twin, pregnancies, where, both, twins, are, head, down, a, trial, of, vaginal, delivery, is, recommended, at, between, 37, and, 38, weeks, vaginal, delivery, in, this, case, does, not, worsen, the, outcome, for, the, infant, as, compared, with, caesarean, section, there, is, controversy, on, the, best, method, of, delivery, where, the, first, twin, is, head, first, and, the, second, is, not, when, the, first, twin, is, not, head, down, a, caesarean, section, is, often, recommended, it, is, estimated, that, 75, of, twin, pregnancies, in, the, united, states, were, delivered, by, caesarean, section, in, 2008, in, comparison, the, rate, of, caesarean, section, for, all, pregnancies, in, the, general, population, varies, between, 14, and, 40, in, twins, that, share, the, same, placenta, delivery, may, be, considered, at, 36, weeks, for, twins, who, are, born, early, there, is, insufficient, evidence, for, or, against, placing, preterm, stable, twins, in, the, same, cot, or, incubator, co, bedding, twin, studies, are, utilized, in, an, attempt, to, determine, how, much, of, a, particular, trait, is, attributable, to, either, genetics, or, environmental, influence, these, studies, compare, monozygotic, and, dizygotic, twins, for, medical, genetic, or, psychological, characteristics, to, try, to, isolate, genetic, influence, from, epigenetic, and, environmental, influence, twins, that, have, been, separated, early, in, life, and, raised, in, separate, households, are, especially, sought, after, for, these, studies, which, have, been, used, widely, in, the, exploration, of, human, nature, classical, twin, studies, are, now, being, supplemented, with, molecular, genetic, studies, which, identify, individual, genes, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, heteropaternal, superfecundation, one, 1992, study, estimates, that, the, frequency, of, heteropaternal, superfecundation, among, dizygotic, twins, whose, parents, were, involved, in, paternity, suits, was, approximately, 2, 4, dizygotic, twins, from, biracial, couples, can, sometimes, be, mixed, twins, which, exhibit, differing, ethnic, and, racial, features, one, such, pairing, was, born, in, london, in, 1993, to, a, white, mother, and, caribbean, father, among, monozygotic, twins, in, extremely, rare, cases, twins, have, been, born, with, different, sexes, one, male, one, female, when, monozygotic, twins, are, born, with, different, sexes, it, is, because, of, chromosomal, defects, the, probability, of, this, is, so, small, that, multiples, having, different, sexes, is, universally, accepted, as, a, sound, basis, for, in, utero, clinical, determination, that, the, multiples, are, not, monozygotic, another, abnormality, that, can, result, in, monozygotic, twins, of, different, sexes, is, if, the, egg, is, fertilized, by, a, male, sperm, but, during, cell, division, only, the, x, chromosome, is, duplicated, this, results, in, one, normal, male, xy, and, one, female, with, turner, syndrome, 45, x, in, these, cases, although, the, twins, did, form, from, the, same, fertilized, egg, it, is, incorrect, to, refer, to, them, as, genetically, identical, since, they, have, different, karyotypes, monozygotic, twins, can, develop, differently, due, to, their, genes, being, differently, activated, more, unusual, are, semi, identical, twins, also, known, as, sesquizygotic, as, of, 2019, only, two, cases, have, been, reported, these, half, identical, twins, are, hypothesized, to, occur, when, an, ovum, is, fertilized, by, two, sperm, the, cell, assorts, the, chromosomes, by, heterogonesis, and, the, cell, divides, into, two, with, each, daughter, cell, now, containing, the, correct, number, of, chromosomes, the, cells, continue, to, develop, into, a, morula, if, the, morula, then, undergoes, a, twinning, event, two, embryos, will, be, formed, with, different, paternal, genes, but, identical, maternal, genes, in, 2007, a, study, reported, a, case, of, a, pair, of, living, twins, which, shared, an, identical, set, of, maternal, chromosomes, while, each, having, a, distinct, set, of, paternal, chromosomes, albeit, from, the, same, man, and, thus, they, most, likely, share, half, of, their, father, s, genetic, makeup, the, twins, were, both, found, to, be, chimeras, one, was, an, intersex, xx, and, one, a, xy, male, the, exact, mechanism, of, fertilization, could, not, be, determined, but, the, study, stated, that, it, was, unlikely, to, be, a, case, of, polar, body, twinning, the, likely, genetic, basis, of, semi, identical, twins, was, reported, in, 2019, by, michael, gabbett, and, nicholas, fisk, in, their, seminal, publication, gabbett, fisk, and, colleagues, documented, a, second, case, of, sesquizygosis, and, presented, molecular, evidence, of, the, phenomenon, the, reported, twins, shared, 100, of, their, maternal, chromosomes, and, 78, of, their, paternal, genomic, information, the, authors, presented, evidence, that, two, sperm, from, the, same, man, fertilized, an, ovum, simultaneously, the, chromosomes, assorted, themselves, through, heterogonesis, to, form, three, cell, lines, the, purely, paternal, cell, line, died, out, due, to, genomic, imprinting, lethality, while, the, other, two, cell, lines, each, consisting, of, the, same, maternal, dna, but, only, 50, identical, paternal, dna, formed, a, morula, which, subsequently, split, into, twins, mirror, image, twins, result, when, a, fertilized, egg, splits, later, in, the, embryonic, stage, than, normal, timing, around, day, 9, 12, this, type, of, twinning, could, exhibit, characteristics, with, reversed, asymmetry, such, as, opposite, dominant, handedness, dental, structure, or, even, organs, situs, inversus, if, the, split, occurs, later, than, this, time, period, the, twins, risk, being, conjoined, there, is, no, dna, based, zygosity, test, that, can, determine, if, twins, are, indeed, mirror, image, the, term, mirror, image, is, used, because, the, twins, when, facing, each, other, appear, as, matching, reflections, there, have, been, many, studies, highlighting, the, development, of, language, in, twins, compared, to, single, born, children, these, studies, have, converged, on, the, notion, that, there, is, a, greater, rate, of, delay, in, language, development, in, twins, compared, to, their, single, born, counterparts, the, reasons, for, this, phenomenon, are, still, in, question, however, cryptophasia, was, thought, to, be, the, major, cause, idioglossia, is, defined, as, a, private, language, that, is, usually, invented, by, young, children, specifically, twins, another, term, to, describe, what, some, people, call, twin, talk, is, cryptophasia, where, a, language, is, developed, by, twins, that, only, they, can, understand, the, increased, focused, communication, between, two, twins, may, isolate, them, from, the, social, environment, surrounding, them, idioglossia, has, been, found, to, be, a, rare, occurrence, and, the, attention, of, scientists, has, shifted, away, from, this, idea, however, there, are, researchers, and, scientists, that, say, cryptophasia, or, idioglossia, is, not, a, rare, phenomenon, current, research, is, looking, into, the, impacts, of, a, richer, social, environment, for, these, twins, to, stimulate, their, development, of, language, non, human, dizygotic, twinning, is, a, common, phenomenon, in, multiple, animal, species, including, cats, dogs, cattle, bats, chimpanzees, and, deer, this, should, not, be, confused, with, an, animal, s, ability, to, produce, a, litter, because, while, litters, are, caused, by, the, release, of, multiple, eggs, during, an, ovulation, cycle, identical, to, the, ovulation, of, dizygotic, twins, they, produce, more, than, two, offspring, species, such, as, sheep, goats, and, deer, have, a, higher, propensity, for, dizygotic, twinning, meaning, that, they, carry, a, higher, frequency, of, the, allele, responsible, for, the, likelihood, of, twins, rather, than, the, likelihood, of, litters, whitcomb, 2021, cases, of, monozygotic, twinning, in, the, animal, kingdom, are, rare, but, have, been, recorded, on, a, number, of, occasions, in, 2016, a, c, section, of, an, irish, wolfhound, revealed, identical, twin, puppies, sharing, a, singular, placenta, south, african, scientists, who, were, called, in, to, study, the, identical, twins, wrote, that, to, the, best, of, our, knowledge, this, is, the, first, report, of, monozygotic, twinning, in, the, dog, confirmed, using, dna, profiling, horton, 2016, additionally, armadillos, have, also, been, known, to, produce, monozygotic, twins, sometimes, birthing, two, sets, of, identical, twins, during, one, reproductive, cycle, monozygotic, twinning, in, armadillos, functions, as, an, evolutionary, adaptation, preventing, inbreeding, once, an, armadillo, offspring, enters, its, reproductive, stage, the, organism, is, forced, to, leave, the, nest, in, search, of, its, mate, rather, than, mating, with, its, siblings, not, only, does, monozygotic, twinning, dissuade, from, armadillo, siblings, inbreeding, but, by, forcing, migration, from, the, nest, this, adaptation, ensures, the, increased, genetic, variation, and, geographical, population, diffusion, of, armadillo, species, due, to, the, increased, parental, investment, provided, for, their, offspring, larger, mammals, with, longer, life, spans, have, slower, reproductive, cycles, and, tend, to, birth, only, one, offspring, at, a, time, this, commonly, repeated, behavior, in, larger, mammals, evolved, as, a, fixed, naturally, selected, adaptation, resulting, in, a, decreased, twinning, propensity, in, species, such, as, giraffes, elephants, and, hippopotami, despite, this, adaptation, a, case, of, rare, monozygotic, twinning, has, been, documented, in, two, elephant, calves, at, the, bandipur, tiger, reserve, in, karnataka, india, chief, veterinarian, of, the, wildlife, trust, of, india, nvk, ashraf, in, response, to, the, twinning, event, wrote, that, in, species, that, invest, longer, time, in, producing, a, baby, taking, care, of, two, twin, calves, will, be, difficult, therefore, the, incidence, of, twinning, will, be, comparatively, less, ashraf, s, insight, not, only, illuminates, the, rarity, of, twinning, among, large, mammals, in, the, natural, world, but, directs, our, attention, to, the, increased, twinning, propensity, of, animals, under, human, care, this, increased, twinning, propensity, is, thought, to, be, either, caused, by, random, mutation, facilitated, by, genetic, drift, or, the, positive, selection, of, the, twinning, trait, in, human, controlled, conditions, due, to, the, removal, of, natural, predators, and, unpredictable, environmental, conditions, with, the, increase, of, human, provided, food, and, medical, care, species, residing, in, nature, reserves, zoos, etc, carry, an, increased, likelihood, of, reversing, their, naturally, selected, traits, that, have, been, passed, on, for, generations, when, considering, this, phenomenon, in, relation, to, twinning, larger, mammals, not, commonly, associated, with, high, twinning, propensities, can, perhaps, produce, twins, as, an, adaptive, response, to, their, human, controlled, environment, additionally, the, high, twinning, propensity, in, species, is, thought, to, be, positively, correlated, with, the, infant, mortality, rate, of, the, reproducing, organism, s, environment, rickard, 2022, p, 2, thus, if, a, species, lives, in, a, controlled, environment, with, a, low, infant, mortality, rate, the, frequency, of, the, twinning, trait, could, increase, leading, to, a, higher, likelihood, of, producing, twin, offspring, in, the, case, of, the, monozygotic, twin, calves, in, india, their, existence, could, be, connected, to, a, new, positively, selected, adaptation, of, twinning, attributed, to, species, living, under, human, care, ward, 2014, p, 7, 11, species, with, small, physicalities, and, quick, reproductive, cycles, carry, high, twinning, propensities, as, a, result, of, increased, predation, and, high, mortality, rates, as, scientists, continue, to, study, the, origin, of, dizygotic, twinning, in, the, animal, kingdom, many, have, turned, to, species, that, demonstrated, an, increased, output, of, twins, during, periods, of, evolutionary, distress, and, natural, selection, through, their, studies, on, vespertilionidae, and, cebidae, species, scientists, guilherme, siniciato, terra, garbino, 2021, and, marco, varella, 2018, have, proven, that, smaller, species, experiencing, infertility, in, old, age, and, or, unstable, habits, as, a, result, of, increased, predation, or, human, interference, can, experience, have, undergone, natural, selection, in, gaining, even, higher, twinning, propensities, in, his, study, on, the, evolution, of, litter, size, in, bats, garbino, discovered, that, the, vespertilionidae, genus, has, higher, twinning, propensities, as, a, result, of, their, high, roosting, habitats, when, tracked, phylogenetically, scientists, determined, that, the, common, ancestor, of, bats, carried, a, higher, twinning, propensity, which, was, then, lost, and, picked, up, again, eighteen, times, in, evolutionary, history, while, other, bat, subfamilies, such, as, myotinae, and, murinae, inevitably, lost, the, twinning, trait, the, family, vespertilionidae, retained, a, high, trait, frequency, due, to, mutation, and, environmental, conditions, that, triggered, natural, selection, the, height, and, exposed, nature, of, vespertilionidae, s, roosting, locations, resulted, in, a, sharp, increase, in, species, mortality, rate, natural, selection, offsets, these, dangers, by, positively, selecting, high, twinning, propensity, resulting, in, not, only, vespertilionidae, s, increased, ability, to, produce, twins, but, the, increased, likelihood, of, the, genus, s, reproductive, survival, this, means, that, despite, the, family, s, high, exposure, to, factors, that, would, seemingly, increase, mortality, rates, vespertilionidae, counteracts, their, environmental, conditions, through, the, evolutionary, adaptation, of, dizygotic, twins, the, prevalence, of, dizygotic, twinning, in, monkeys, is, thought, to, be, an, insurance, adaptation, for, mothers, reproducing, at, the, end, of, their, fertile, years, while, dizygotic, twinning, has, been, observed, in, species, such, as, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, monkeys, in, the, cebidae, genus, are, found, to, be, more, likely, to, produce, twins, because, of, their, small, size, and, insect, based, diet, varella, 2018, this, is, because, their, small, size, indicates, shorter, gestation, periods, and, the, rapid, maturation, of, offspring, resulting, in, a, shorter, lifespan, where, organisms, are, rapidly, replaced, by, newer, generations, the, smaller, size, of, the, cebidae, genus, also, makes, these, species, more, susceptible, to, predators, thus, triggering, the, heightened, pace, of, birth, maturation, reproduction, and, death, meanwhile, cebidae, s, insectivorous, existence, can, be, correlated, with, this, genus, s, heightened, ability, to, reproduce, as, more, resources, become, available, more, organisms, can, take, advantage, of, these, resources, thus, monkeys, that, are, smaller, and, have, more, access, to, food, such, as, the, cebidae, genus, have, the, ability, to, produce, more, offspring, at, a, quicker, pace, in, terms, of, dizygotic, twinning, it, has, been, observed, that, older, mothers, within, the, cebidae, genus, have, a, higher, chance, of, producing, twins, than, those, at, the, beginning, stages, of, their, fertility, despite, their, access, to, resources, the, cebidae, genus, has, a, high, mortality, rate, attributed, to, their, size, meaning, that, in, order, to, keep, up, their, quickened, lifecycle, they, must, produce, an, excess, of, offspring, in, ensuring, generational, survival, the, positively, selected, adaptation, of, twinning, counteracts, the, genus, s, high, mortality, rate, by, giving, older, mothers, the, chance, to, produce, more, than, one, offspring, this, not, only, increases, the, likelihood, that, one, or, more, of, these, offspring, will, reach, reproductive, maturity, but, gives, the, mother, a, chance, to, birth, at, least, one, viable, offspring, despite, their, age, due, to, their, short, life, cycles, the, cebidae, genus, is, more, inclined, to, produce, dizygotic, twins, in, their, older, reproductive, years, thus, signaling, that, the, trait, of, high, twinning, propensity, is, one, that, is, passed, down, in, service, of, this, genus, s, survival
