human, sexuality, is, the, way, people, experience, and, express, themselves, sexually, this, involves, biological, psychological, physical, erotic, emotional, social, or, spiritual, feelings, and, behaviors, because, it, is, a, broad, term, which, has, varied, with, historical, contexts, over, time, it, lacks, a, precise, definition, the, biological, and, physical, aspects, of, sexuality, largely, concern, the, human, reproductive, functions, including, the, human, sexual, response, cycle, someone, s, sexual, orientation, is, their, pattern, of, sexual, interest, in, the, opposite, and, or, same, sex, physical, and, emotional, aspects, of, sexuality, include, bonds, between, individuals, that, are, expressed, through, profound, feelings, or, physical, manifestations, of, love, trust, and, care, social, aspects, deal, with, the, effects, of, human, society, on, one, s, sexuality, while, spirituality, concerns, an, individual, s, spiritual, connection, with, others, sexuality, also, affects, and, is, affected, by, cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and, religious, aspects, of, life, interest, in, sexual, activity, normally, increases, when, an, individual, reaches, puberty, although, no, single, theory, on, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, has, yet, gained, widespread, support, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, hypothesized, social, causes, are, supported, by, only, weak, evidence, distorted, by, numerous, confounding, factors, this, is, further, supported, by, cross, cultural, evidence, because, cultures, that, are, tolerant, of, homosexuality, do, not, have, significantly, higher, rates, of, it, evolutionary, perspectives, on, human, coupling, reproduction, and, reproduction, strategies, and, social, learning, theory, provide, further, views, of, sexuality, sociocultural, aspects, of, sexuality, include, historical, developments, and, religious, beliefs, some, cultures, have, been, described, as, sexually, repressive, the, study, of, sexuality, also, includes, human, identity, within, social, groups, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, and, birth, control, methods, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, innate, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, learned, ones, especially, for, males, this, evidence, includes, the, cross, cultural, correlation, of, homosexuality, and, childhood, gender, nonconformity, moderate, genetic, influences, found, in, twin, studies, evidence, for, prenatal, hormonal, effects, on, brain, organization, the, fraternal, birth, order, effect, and, the, finding, that, in, rare, cases, where, infant, males, were, raised, as, girls, due, to, physical, differences, or, deformity, they, nevertheless, turned, out, attracted, to, females, hypothesized, social, causes, are, supported, by, only, weak, evidence, distorted, by, numerous, confounding, factors, cross, cultural, evidence, also, leans, more, toward, non, social, causes, cultures, that, are, very, tolerant, of, homosexuality, do, not, have, significantly, higher, rates, of, it, homosexual, behavior, is, relatively, common, among, boys, in, british, single, sex, boarding, schools, but, adult, britons, who, attended, such, schools, are, no, more, likely, to, engage, in, homosexual, behavior, than, those, who, did, not, in, an, extreme, case, the, sambia, people, ritually, require, their, boys, to, engage, in, homosexual, behavior, during, adolescence, before, they, have, any, access, to, females, yet, most, of, these, boys, become, heterosexual, it, is, not, fully, understood, why, genes, causing, homosexuality, persist, in, the, gene, pool, one, hypothesis, involves, kin, selection, suggesting, that, homosexuals, invest, heavily, enough, in, their, relatives, to, offset, the, cost, of, not, reproducing, as, much, directly, this, has, not, been, supported, by, studies, in, western, cultures, but, several, studies, in, samoa, have, found, some, support, for, this, hypothesis, another, hypothesis, involves, sexually, antagonistic, genes, which, cause, homosexuality, when, expressed, in, males, but, increase, reproduction, when, expressed, in, females, studies, in, both, western, and, non, western, cultures, have, found, support, for, this, hypothesis, psychological, theories, exist, regarding, the, development, and, expression, of, gender, differences, in, human, sexuality, a, number, of, them, including, neo, analytic, theories, sociobiological, theories, social, learning, theory, social, role, theory, and, script, theory, agree, in, predicting, that, men, should, be, more, approving, of, casual, sex, sex, happening, outside, a, stable, committed, relationship, such, as, marriage, and, should, also, be, more, promiscuous, have, a, higher, number, of, sexual, partners, than, women, these, theories, are, mostly, consistent, with, observed, differences, in, males, and, females, attitudes, toward, casual, sex, before, marriage, in, the, united, states, other, aspects, of, human, sexuality, such, as, sexual, satisfaction, incidence, of, oral, sex, and, attitudes, toward, homosexuality, and, masturbation, show, little, to, no, observed, difference, between, males, and, females, observed, gender, differences, regarding, the, number, of, sexual, partners, are, modest, with, males, tending, to, have, slightly, more, than, females, like, other, mammals, humans, are, primarily, grouped, into, either, the, male, or, female, sex, the, biological, aspects, of, humans, sexuality, deal, with, the, reproductive, system, the, sexual, response, cycle, and, the, factors, that, affect, these, aspects, they, also, deal, with, the, influence, of, biological, factors, on, other, aspects, of, sexuality, such, as, organic, and, neurological, responses, heredity, hormonal, issues, gender, issues, and, sexual, dysfunction, males, and, females, are, anatomically, similar, this, extends, to, some, degree, to, the, development, of, the, reproductive, system, as, adults, they, have, different, reproductive, mechanisms, that, enable, them, to, perform, sexual, acts, and, to, reproduce, men, and, women, react, to, sexual, stimuli, in, a, similar, fashion, with, minor, differences, women, have, a, monthly, reproductive, cycle, whereas, the, male, sperm, production, cycle, is, more, continuous, the, hypothalamus, is, the, most, important, part, of, the, brain, for, sexual, functioning, this, is, a, small, area, at, the, base, of, the, brain, consisting, of, several, groups, of, nerve, cell, bodies, that, receives, input, from, the, limbic, system, studies, have, shown, that, within, lab, animals, the, destruction, of, certain, areas, of, the, hypothalamus, causes, the, elimination, of, sexual, behavior, the, hypothalamus, is, important, because, of, its, relationship, to, the, pituitary, gland, which, lies, beneath, it, the, pituitary, gland, secretes, hormones, that, are, produced, in, the, hypothalamus, and, itself, the, four, important, sexual, hormones, are, oxytocin, prolactin, follicle, stimulating, hormone, and, luteinizing, hormone, oxytocin, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, love, hormone, is, released, in, both, sexes, during, sexual, intercourse, when, an, orgasm, is, achieved, oxytocin, has, been, suggested, as, critical, to, the, thoughts, and, behaviors, required, to, maintain, close, relationships, the, hormone, is, also, released, in, women, when, they, give, birth, or, are, breastfeeding, prolactin, and, oxytocin, are, responsible, for, inducing, milk, production, in, women, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, is, responsible, for, ovulation, in, women, and, acts, by, triggering, egg, maturity, in, men, it, stimulates, sperm, production, luteinizing, hormone, lh, triggers, ovulation, which, is, the, release, of, a, mature, egg, males, have, both, internal, and, external, genitalia, that, are, responsible, for, procreation, and, sexual, intercourse, production, of, spermatozoa, sperm, is, also, cyclic, but, unlike, the, female, ovulation, cycle, the, sperm, production, cycle, is, constantly, producing, millions, of, sperm, daily, the, external, male, genitalia, are, the, penis, and, the, scrotum, the, penis, provides, a, passageway, for, sperm, and, urine, the, penis, consists, of, nerves, blood, vessels, fibrous, tissue, and, three, parallel, cylinders, of, spongy, tissue, other, components, of, the, penis, include, the, shaft, glans, root, cavernous, bodies, and, spongy, body, the, three, cylindrical, bodies, of, spongy, tissue, which, are, filled, with, blood, vessels, run, along, the, length, of, the, shaft, the, two, bodies, that, lie, side, by, side, in, the, upper, portion, of, the, penis, are, the, corpora, cavernosa, cavernous, bodies, the, third, called, the, corpus, spongiosum, spongy, body, is, a, tube, that, lies, centrally, beneath, the, others, and, expands, at, the, end, to, form, the, tip, of, the, penis, glans, during, arousal, these, bodies, erect, the, penis, by, filling, with, blood, the, raised, rim, at, the, border, of, the, shaft, and, glans, is, called, the, corona, the, urethra, connects, the, urinary, bladder, to, the, penis, where, urine, exits, the, penis, through, the, urethral, meatus, the, urethra, eliminates, urine, and, acts, as, a, channel, for, semen, and, sperm, to, exit, the, body, during, sexual, intercourse, the, root, consists, of, the, expanded, ends, of, the, cavernous, bodies, which, fan, out, to, form, the, crura, and, attach, to, the, pubic, bone, and, the, expanded, end, of, the, spongy, body, the, bulb, of, the, penis, is, surrounded, by, the, bulbospongiosus, muscle, while, the, corpora, cavernosa, are, surrounded, by, the, ischiocavernosus, muscles, these, aid, urination, and, ejaculation, the, penis, has, a, foreskin, that, typically, covers, the, glans, this, is, sometimes, removed, by, circumcision, for, medical, religious, or, cultural, reasons, in, the, scrotum, the, testicles, are, held, away, from, the, body, one, possible, reason, for, this, is, so, sperm, can, be, produced, in, an, environment, slightly, lower, than, normal, body, temperature, the, penis, has, very, little, muscular, tissue, and, this, exists, in, its, root, the, shaft, and, glans, have, no, muscle, fibers, unlike, most, other, primates, male, humans, lack, a, penile, bone, male, internal, reproductive, structures, are, the, testicles, the, duct, system, the, prostate, and, seminal, vesicles, and, the, cowper, s, gland, the, testicles, male, gonads, are, where, sperm, and, male, hormones, are, produced, millions, of, sperm, are, produced, daily, in, several, hundred, seminiferous, tubules, cells, called, the, leydig, cells, lie, between, the, tubules, these, produce, hormones, called, androgens, these, consist, of, testosterone, and, inhibin, the, testicles, are, held, by, the, spermatic, cord, which, is, a, tubelike, structure, containing, blood, vessels, nerves, the, vas, deferens, and, a, muscle, that, helps, to, raise, and, lower, the, testicles, in, response, to, temperature, changes, and, sexual, arousal, in, which, the, testicles, are, drawn, closer, to, the, body, sperm, gets, transported, through, a, four, part, duct, system, the, first, part, of, this, system, is, the, epididymis, the, testicles, converge, to, form, the, seminiferous, tubules, coiled, tubes, at, the, top, and, back, of, each, testicle, the, second, part, of, the, duct, system, is, the, vas, deferens, a, muscular, tube, that, begins, at, the, lower, end, of, the, epididymis, the, vas, deferens, passes, upward, along, the, side, of, the, testicles, to, become, part, of, the, spermatic, cord, the, expanded, end, is, the, ampulla, which, stores, sperm, before, ejaculation, the, third, part, of, the, duct, system, is, the, ejaculatory, ducts, which, are, 1, inch, 2, 5, cm, long, paired, tubes, that, pass, through, the, prostate, gland, where, semen, is, produced, the, prostate, gland, is, a, solid, chestnut, shaped, organ, that, surrounds, the, first, part, of, the, urethra, which, carries, urine, and, semen, similar, to, the, female, g, spot, the, prostate, provides, sexual, stimulation, and, can, lead, to, orgasm, through, anal, sex, the, prostate, gland, and, the, seminal, vesicles, produce, seminal, fluid, that, is, mixed, with, sperm, to, create, semen, the, prostate, gland, lies, under, the, bladder, and, in, front, of, the, rectum, it, consists, of, two, main, zones, the, inner, zone, that, produces, secretions, to, keep, the, lining, of, the, male, urethra, moist, and, the, outer, zone, that, produces, seminal, fluids, to, facilitate, the, passage, of, semen, the, seminal, vesicles, secrete, fructose, for, sperm, activation, and, mobilization, prostaglandins, to, cause, uterine, contractions, that, aid, movement, through, the, uterus, and, bases, that, help, neutralize, the, acidity, of, the, vagina, the, cowper, s, glands, or, bulbourethral, glands, are, two, pea, sized, structures, beneath, the, prostate, the, external, female, genitalia, are, the, vulva, the, mons, pubis, is, a, soft, layer, of, fatty, tissue, overlaying, the, pubic, bone, following, puberty, this, area, grows, in, size, it, has, many, nerve, endings, and, is, sensitive, to, stimulation, the, labia, minora, and, labia, majora, are, collectively, known, as, the, labia, or, lips, the, labia, majora, are, two, elongated, folds, of, skin, extending, from, the, mons, to, the, perineum, its, outer, surface, becomes, covered, with, hair, after, puberty, in, between, the, labia, majora, are, the, labia, minora, two, hairless, folds, of, skin, that, meet, above, the, clitoris, to, form, the, clitoral, hood, which, is, highly, sensitive, to, touch, the, labia, minora, become, engorged, with, blood, during, sexual, stimulation, causing, them, to, swell, and, turn, red, the, labia, minora, are, composed, of, connective, tissues, that, are, richly, supplied, with, blood, vessels, which, cause, a, pinkish, appearance, near, the, anus, the, labia, minora, merge, with, the, labia, majora, in, a, sexually, unstimulated, state, the, labia, minora, protects, the, vaginal, and, urethral, opening, by, covering, them, at, the, base, of, the, labia, minora, are, the, bartholin, s, glands, which, add, a, few, drops, of, an, alkaline, fluid, to, the, vagina, via, ducts, this, fluid, helps, to, counteract, the, acidity, of, the, outer, vagina, since, sperm, cannot, live, in, an, acidic, environment, the, skene, s, glands, are, possibly, responsible, for, secreting, fluid, during, female, ejaculation, the, clitoris, is, developed, from, the, same, embryonic, tissue, as, the, penis, it, or, its, glans, alone, consists, of, as, many, or, more, in, some, cases, nerve, endings, as, the, human, penis, or, glans, penis, making, it, extremely, sensitive, to, touch, the, clitoral, glans, which, is, a, small, elongated, erectile, structure, has, only, one, known, function, sexual, sensations, it, is, the, female, s, most, sensitive, erogenous, zone, and, the, main, source, of, orgasm, in, women, thick, secretions, called, smegma, collect, around, the, clitoris, the, vaginal, opening, and, the, urethral, opening, are, only, visible, when, the, labia, minora, are, parted, these, openings, have, many, nerve, endings, that, make, them, sensitive, to, touch, they, are, surrounded, by, a, ring, of, sphincter, muscles, called, the, bulbocavernosus, muscle, underneath, this, muscle, and, on, opposite, sides, of, the, vaginal, opening, are, the, vestibular, bulbs, which, help, the, vagina, grip, the, penis, by, swelling, with, blood, during, arousal, within, the, vaginal, opening, is, the, hymen, a, thin, membrane, that, partially, covers, the, opening, in, many, virgins, rupture, of, the, hymen, has, been, historically, considered, the, loss, of, one, s, virginity, though, by, modern, standards, loss, of, virginity, is, considered, to, be, the, first, sexual, intercourse, the, hymen, can, be, ruptured, by, activities, other, than, sexual, intercourse, the, urethral, opening, connects, to, the, bladder, with, the, urethra, it, expels, urine, from, the, bladder, this, is, located, below, the, clitoris, and, above, the, vaginal, opening, the, breasts, are, the, subcutaneous, tissues, on, the, front, thorax, of, the, female, body, though, they, are, not, technically, part, of, a, woman, s, sexual, anatomy, they, do, have, roles, in, both, sexual, pleasure, and, reproduction, breasts, are, modified, sweat, glands, made, up, of, fibrous, tissues, and, fat, that, provide, support, and, contain, nerves, blood, vessels, and, lymphatic, vessels, their, main, purpose, is, to, provide, milk, to, a, developing, infant, breasts, develop, during, puberty, in, response, to, an, increase, in, estrogen, each, adult, breast, consists, of, 15, to, 20, milk, producing, mammary, glands, irregularly, shaped, lobes, that, include, alveolar, glands, and, a, lactiferous, duct, leading, to, the, nipple, the, lobes, are, separated, by, dense, connective, tissues, that, support, the, glands, and, attach, them, to, the, tissues, on, the, underlying, pectoral, muscles, other, connective, tissue, which, forms, dense, strands, called, suspensory, ligaments, extends, inward, from, the, skin, of, the, breast, to, the, pectoral, tissue, to, support, the, weight, of, the, breast, heredity, and, the, quantity, of, fatty, tissue, determine, the, size, of, the, breasts, men, typically, find, female, breasts, attractive, and, this, holds, true, for, a, variety, of, cultures, in, women, stimulation, of, the, nipple, seems, to, result, in, activation, of, the, brain, s, genital, sensory, cortex, the, same, region, of, the, brain, activated, by, stimulation, of, the, clitoris, vagina, and, cervix, this, may, be, why, many, women, find, nipple, stimulation, arousing, and, why, some, women, are, able, to, orgasm, by, nipple, stimulation, alone, the, female, internal, reproductive, organs, are, the, vagina, uterus, fallopian, tubes, and, ovaries, the, vagina, is, a, sheath, like, canal, that, extends, from, the, vulva, to, the, cervix, it, receives, the, penis, during, intercourse, and, serves, as, a, depository, for, sperm, the, vagina, is, also, the, birth, canal, it, can, expand, to, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, during, labor, and, delivery, the, vagina, is, located, between, the, bladder, and, the, rectum, the, vagina, is, normally, collapsed, but, during, sexual, arousal, it, opens, lengthens, and, produces, lubrication, to, allow, the, insertion, of, the, penis, the, vagina, has, three, layered, walls, it, is, a, self, cleaning, organ, with, natural, bacteria, that, suppress, the, production, of, yeast, the, g, spot, named, after, the, ernst, gr, fenberg, who, first, reported, it, in, 1950, may, be, located, in, the, front, wall, of, the, vagina, and, may, cause, orgasms, this, area, may, vary, in, size, and, location, between, women, in, some, it, may, be, absent, various, researchers, dispute, its, structure, or, existence, or, regard, it, as, an, extension, of, the, clitoris, the, uterus, or, womb, is, a, hollow, muscular, organ, where, a, fertilized, egg, ovum, will, implant, itself, and, grow, into, a, fetus, the, uterus, lies, in, the, pelvic, cavity, between, the, bladder, and, the, bowel, and, above, the, vagina, it, is, usually, positioned, in, a, 90, degree, angle, tilting, forward, although, in, about, 20, of, women, it, tilts, backwards, the, uterus, has, three, layers, the, innermost, layer, is, the, endometrium, where, the, egg, is, implanted, during, ovulation, this, thickens, for, implantation, if, implantation, does, not, occur, it, is, sloughed, off, during, menstruation, the, cervix, is, the, narrow, end, of, the, uterus, the, broad, part, of, the, uterus, is, the, fundus, during, ovulation, the, ovum, travels, down, the, fallopian, tubes, to, the, uterus, these, extend, about, four, inches, 10, cm, from, both, sides, of, the, uterus, finger, like, projections, at, the, ends, of, the, tubes, brush, the, ovaries, and, receive, the, ovum, once, it, is, released, the, ovum, then, travels, for, three, to, four, days, to, the, uterus, after, sexual, intercourse, sperm, swim, up, this, funnel, from, the, uterus, the, lining, of, the, tube, and, its, secretions, sustain, the, egg, and, the, sperm, encouraging, fertilization, and, nourishing, the, ovum, until, it, reaches, the, uterus, if, the, ovum, divides, after, fertilization, identical, twins, are, produced, if, separate, eggs, are, fertilized, by, different, sperm, the, mother, gives, birth, to, non, identical, or, fraternal, twins, the, ovaries, female, gonads, develop, from, the, same, embryonic, tissue, as, the, testicles, the, ovaries, are, suspended, by, ligaments, and, are, the, source, where, ova, are, stored, and, developed, before, ovulation, the, ovaries, also, produce, female, hormones, progesterone, and, estrogen, within, the, ovaries, each, ovum, is, surrounded, by, other, cells, and, contained, within, a, capsule, called, a, primary, follicle, at, puberty, one, or, more, of, these, follicles, are, stimulated, to, mature, on, a, monthly, basis, once, matured, these, are, called, graafian, follicles, the, female, reproductive, system, does, not, produce, the, ova, about, 60, 000, ova, are, present, at, birth, only, 400, of, which, will, mature, during, the, woman, s, lifetime, ovulation, is, based, on, a, monthly, cycle, the, 14th, day, is, the, most, fertile, on, days, one, to, four, menstruation, and, production, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, decreases, and, the, endometrium, starts, thinning, the, endometrium, is, sloughed, off, for, the, next, three, to, six, days, once, menstruation, ends, the, cycle, begins, again, with, an, fsh, surge, from, the, pituitary, gland, days, five, to, thirteen, are, known, as, the, pre, ovulatory, stage, during, this, stage, the, pituitary, gland, secretes, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, a, negative, feedback, loop, is, enacted, when, estrogen, is, secreted, to, inhibit, the, release, of, fsh, estrogen, thickens, the, endometrium, of, the, uterus, a, surge, of, luteinizing, hormone, lh, triggers, ovulation, on, day, 14, the, lh, surge, causes, a, graafian, follicle, to, surface, the, ovary, the, follicle, ruptures, and, the, ripe, ovum, is, expelled, into, the, abdominal, cavity, the, fallopian, tubes, pick, up, the, ovum, with, the, fimbria, the, cervical, mucus, changes, to, aid, the, movement, of, sperm, on, days, 15, to, 28, the, post, ovulatory, stage, the, graafian, follicle, now, called, the, corpus, luteum, secretes, estrogen, production, of, progesterone, increases, inhibiting, lh, release, the, endometrium, thickens, to, prepare, for, implantation, and, the, ovum, travels, down, the, fallopian, tubes, to, the, uterus, if, the, ovum, is, not, fertilized, and, does, not, implant, menstruation, begins, the, sexual, response, cycle, is, a, model, that, describes, the, physiological, responses, that, occur, during, sexual, activity, this, model, was, created, by, william, masters, and, virginia, johnson, according, to, masters, and, johnson, the, human, sexual, response, cycle, consists, of, four, phases, excitement, plateau, orgasm, and, resolution, also, called, the, epor, model, during, the, excitement, phase, of, the, epor, model, one, attains, the, intrinsic, motivation, to, have, sex, the, plateau, phase, is, the, precursor, to, orgasm, which, may, be, mostly, biological, for, men, and, mostly, psychological, for, women, orgasm, is, the, release, of, tension, and, the, resolution, period, is, the, unaroused, state, before, the, cycle, begins, again, the, male, sexual, response, cycle, starts, in, the, excitement, phase, two, centers, in, the, spine, are, responsible, for, erections, vasoconstriction, in, the, penis, begins, the, heart, rate, increases, the, scrotum, thickens, the, spermatic, cord, shortens, and, the, testicles, become, engorged, with, blood, in, the, plateau, phase, the, penis, increases, in, diameter, the, testicles, become, more, engorged, and, the, cowper, s, glands, secrete, pre, seminal, fluid, the, orgasm, phase, during, which, rhythmic, contractions, occur, every, 0, 8, seconds, consists, of, two, phases, the, emission, phase, in, which, contractions, of, the, vas, deferens, prostate, and, seminal, vesicles, encourage, ejaculation, which, is, the, second, phase, of, orgasm, ejaculation, is, called, the, expulsion, phase, it, cannot, be, reached, without, an, orgasm, in, the, resolution, phase, the, male, is, now, in, an, unaroused, state, consisting, of, a, refractory, rest, period, before, the, cycle, can, begin, this, rest, period, may, increase, with, age, the, female, sexual, response, begins, with, the, excitement, phase, which, can, last, from, several, minutes, to, several, hours, characteristics, of, this, phase, include, increased, heart, and, respiratory, rate, and, an, elevation, of, blood, pressure, flushed, skin, or, blotches, of, redness, may, occur, on, the, chest, and, back, breasts, increase, slightly, in, size, and, nipples, may, become, hardened, and, erect, the, onset, of, vasocongestion, results, in, swelling, of, the, clitoris, labia, minora, and, vagina, the, muscle, that, surrounds, the, vaginal, opening, tightens, and, the, uterus, elevates, and, grows, in, size, the, vaginal, walls, begin, to, produce, a, lubricating, liquid, the, second, phase, called, the, plateau, phase, is, characterized, primarily, by, the, intensification, of, the, changes, begun, during, the, excitement, phase, the, plateau, phase, extends, to, the, brink, of, orgasm, which, initiates, the, resolution, stage, the, reversal, of, the, changes, begun, during, the, excitement, phase, during, the, orgasm, stage, the, heart, rate, blood, pressure, muscle, tension, and, breathing, rates, peak, the, pelvic, muscle, near, the, vagina, the, anal, sphincter, and, the, uterus, contract, muscle, contractions, in, the, vaginal, area, create, a, high, level, of, pleasure, though, all, orgasms, are, centered, in, the, clitoris, sexual, disorders, according, to, the, dsm, iv, tr, are, disturbances, in, sexual, desire, and, psycho, physiological, changes, that, characterize, the, sexual, response, cycle, and, cause, marked, distress, and, interpersonal, difficulty, the, sexual, dysfunctions, are, a, result, of, physical, or, psychological, disorders, the, physical, causes, include, hormonal, imbalance, diabetes, heart, disease, and, more, the, psychological, causes, include, but, are, not, limited, to, stress, anxiety, and, depression, the, sexual, dysfunction, affects, men, and, women, there, are, four, major, categories, of, sexual, problems, for, women, desire, disorders, arousal, disorders, orgasmic, disorders, and, sexual, pain, disorders, the, sexual, desire, disorder, occurs, when, an, individual, lacks, the, sexual, desire, because, of, hormonal, changes, depression, and, pregnancy, the, arousal, disorder, is, a, female, sexual, dysfunction, arousal, disorder, means, lack, of, vaginal, lubrication, in, addition, blood, flow, problems, may, affect, arousal, disorder, lack, of, orgasm, also, known, as, anorgasmia, is, another, sexual, dysfunction, in, women, the, anorgasmia, occurs, in, women, with, psychological, disorders, such, as, guilt, and, anxiety, that, was, caused, by, sexual, assault, the, last, sexual, disorder, is, the, painful, intercourse, the, sexual, disorder, can, be, result, of, pelvic, mass, scar, tissue, sexually, transmitted, infection, and, more, there, are, also, three, common, sexual, disorders, for, men, including, sexual, desire, ejaculation, disorder, and, erectile, dysfunction, the, lack, of, sexual, desire, in, men, is, because, of, loss, of, libido, low, testosterone, there, are, also, psychological, factors, such, as, anxiety, and, depression, the, ejaculation, disorder, has, three, types, retrograde, ejaculation, retarded, ejaculation, premature, ejaculation, the, erectile, dysfunction, is, a, disability, to, have, and, maintain, an, erection, during, intercourse, as, one, form, of, behavior, the, psychological, aspects, of, sexual, expression, have, been, studied, in, the, context, of, emotional, involvement, gender, identity, intersubjective, intimacy, and, darwinian, reproductive, efficacy, sexuality, in, humans, generates, profound, emotional, and, psychological, responses, some, theorists, identify, sexuality, as, the, central, source, of, human, personality, psychological, studies, of, sexuality, focus, on, psychological, influences, that, affect, sexual, behavior, and, experiences, early, psychological, analyses, were, carried, out, by, sigmund, freud, who, believed, in, a, psychoanalytic, approach, he, also, proposed, the, concepts, of, psychosexual, development, and, the, oedipus, complex, among, other, theories, gender, identity, is, a, person, s, sense, of, their, own, gender, whether, male, female, or, non, binary, gender, identity, can, correlate, with, assigned, sex, at, birth, or, can, differ, from, it, all, societies, have, a, set, of, gender, categories, that, can, serve, as, the, basis, of, the, formation, of, a, person, s, social, identity, in, relation, to, other, members, of, society, sexual, behavior, and, intimate, relationships, are, strongly, influenced, by, a, person, s, sexual, orientation, sexual, orientation, is, an, enduring, pattern, of, romantic, or, sexual, attraction, or, a, combination, of, these, to, persons, of, the, opposite, sex, same, sex, or, both, sexes, heterosexual, people, are, romantically, sexually, attracted, to, the, members, of, the, opposite, sex, gay, and, lesbian, people, are, romantically, sexually, attracted, to, people, of, the, same, sex, and, those, who, are, bisexual, are, romantically, sexually, attracted, to, both, sexes, the, idea, that, homosexuality, results, from, reversed, gender, roles, is, reinforced, by, the, media, s, portrayal, of, gay, men, as, feminine, and, lesbians, as, masculine, however, a, person, s, conformity, or, non, conformity, to, gender, stereotypes, does, not, always, predict, sexual, orientation, society, believes, that, if, a, man, is, masculine, he, is, heterosexual, and, if, a, man, is, feminine, he, is, homosexual, there, is, no, strong, evidence, that, a, homosexual, or, bisexual, orientation, must, be, associated, with, atypical, gender, roles, by, the, early, 21st, century, homosexuality, was, no, longer, considered, to, be, a, pathology, theories, have, linked, many, factors, including, genetic, anatomical, birth, order, and, hormones, in, the, prenatal, environment, to, homosexuality, other, than, the, need, to, procreate, there, are, many, other, reasons, people, have, sex, according, to, one, study, conducted, on, college, students, meston, buss, 2007, the, four, main, reasons, for, sexual, activities, are, physical, attraction, as, a, means, to, an, end, to, increase, emotional, connection, and, to, alleviate, insecurity, until, sigmund, freud, published, his, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, in, 1905, children, were, often, regarded, as, asexual, having, no, sexuality, until, later, development, sigmund, freud, was, one, of, the, first, researchers, to, take, child, sexuality, seriously, his, ideas, such, as, psychosexual, development, and, the, oedipus, conflict, have, been, much, debated, but, acknowledging, the, existence, of, child, sexuality, was, an, important, development, freud, gave, sexual, drives, an, importance, and, centrality, in, human, life, actions, and, behavior, he, said, sexual, drives, exist, and, can, be, discerned, in, children, from, birth, he, explains, this, in, his, theory, of, infantile, sexuality, and, says, sexual, energy, libido, is, the, most, important, motivating, force, in, adult, life, freud, wrote, about, the, importance, of, interpersonal, relationships, to, one, s, sexual, and, emotional, development, from, birth, the, mother, s, connection, to, the, infant, affects, the, infant, s, later, capacity, for, pleasure, and, attachment, freud, described, two, currents, of, emotional, life, an, affectionate, current, including, our, bonds, with, the, important, people, in, our, lives, and, a, sensual, current, including, our, wish, to, gratify, sexual, impulses, during, adolescence, a, young, person, tries, to, integrate, these, two, emotional, currents, alfred, kinsey, also, examined, child, sexuality, in, his, kinsey, reports, children, are, naturally, curious, about, their, bodies, and, sexual, functions, for, example, they, wonder, where, babies, come, from, they, notice, the, differences, between, males, and, females, and, many, engage, in, genital, play, which, is, often, mistaken, for, masturbation, child, sex, play, also, known, as, playing, doctor, includes, exhibiting, or, inspecting, the, genitals, many, children, take, part, in, some, sex, play, typically, with, siblings, or, friends, sex, play, with, others, usually, decreases, as, children, grow, but, they, may, later, possess, romantic, interest, in, their, peers, curiosity, levels, remain, high, during, these, years, but, the, main, surge, in, sexual, interest, occurs, in, adolescence, adult, sexuality, originates, in, childhood, however, like, many, other, human, capacities, sexuality, is, not, fixed, but, matures, and, develops, a, common, stereotype, associated, with, old, people, is, that, they, tend, to, lose, interest, and, the, ability, to, engage, in, sexual, acts, once, they, reach, late, adulthood, this, misconception, is, reinforced, by, western, popular, culture, which, often, ridicules, older, adults, who, try, to, engage, in, sexual, activities, age, does, not, necessarily, change, the, need, or, desire, to, be, sexually, expressive, or, active, a, couple, in, a, long, term, relationship, may, find, that, the, frequency, of, their, sexual, activity, decreases, over, time, and, the, type, of, sexual, expression, may, change, but, feelings, of, intimacy, may, continue, to, grow, and, develop, over, time, human, sexuality, can, be, understood, as, part, of, the, social, life, of, humans, which, is, governed, by, implied, rules, of, behavior, and, the, status, quo, this, narrows, the, view, to, groups, within, a, society, the, socio, cultural, context, of, society, including, the, effects, of, politics, and, the, mass, media, influences, and, forms, social, norms, throughout, history, social, norms, have, been, changing, and, continue, to, change, as, a, result, of, movements, such, as, the, sexual, revolution, and, the, rise, of, feminism, the, age, and, manner, in, which, children, are, informed, of, issues, of, sexuality, is, a, matter, of, sex, education, the, school, systems, in, almost, all, developed, countries, have, some, form, of, sex, education, but, the, nature, of, the, issues, covered, varies, widely, in, some, countries, such, as, australia, and, much, of, europe, age, appropriate, sex, education, often, begins, in, pre, school, whereas, other, countries, leave, sex, education, to, the, pre, teenage, and, teenage, years, sex, education, covers, a, range, of, topics, including, the, physical, mental, and, social, aspects, of, sexual, behavior, communities, have, differing, opinions, on, the, appropriate, age, for, children, to, learn, about, sexuality, according, to, time, magazine, and, cnn, 74, of, teenagers, in, the, united, states, reported, that, their, major, sources, of, sexual, information, were, their, peers, and, the, media, compared, to, 10, who, named, their, parents, or, a, sex, education, course, in, the, united, states, some, sex, education, programs, encourage, abstinence, only, the, choice, to, restrain, oneself, from, sexual, activity, in, contrast, comprehensive, sex, education, aims, to, encourage, students, to, take, charge, of, their, own, sexuality, and, know, how, to, have, safe, healthy, and, pleasurable, sex, if, and, when, they, choose, to, do, so, proponents, for, an, abstinence, only, education, believe, that, teaching, a, comprehensive, curriculum, would, encourage, teenagers, to, have, sex, while, proponents, for, comprehensive, sex, education, argue, that, many, teenagers, will, have, sex, regardless, and, should, be, equipped, with, knowledge, of, how, to, have, sex, responsibly, according, to, data, from, the, national, longitudinal, survey, of, youth, many, teens, who, intend, to, be, abstinent, fail, to, do, so, and, when, these, teenagers, do, have, sex, many, do, not, use, safe, sex, practices, such, as, contraceptives, sexuality, has, been, an, important, vital, part, of, human, existence, throughout, history, all, civilizations, have, managed, sexuality, through, sexual, standards, representations, and, behavior, before, the, rise, of, agriculture, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, and, nomadic, groups, inhabited, the, world, these, groups, had, less, restrictive, sexual, standards, that, emphasized, sexual, pleasure, and, enjoyment, but, with, definite, rules, and, constraints, some, underlying, continuities, or, key, regulatory, standards, contended, with, the, tension, between, recognition, of, pleasure, interest, and, the, need, to, procreate, for, the, sake, of, social, order, and, economic, survival, hunter, gatherers, also, placed, high, value, on, certain, types, of, sexual, symbolism, a, common, tension, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, is, expressed, in, their, art, which, emphasized, male, sexuality, and, prowess, but, also, blurred, gender, lines, in, sexual, matters, one, example, of, these, male, dominated, portrayals, is, the, egyptian, creation, myth, in, which, the, sun, god, atum, masturbates, in, the, water, creating, the, nile, river, in, sumerian, myth, the, gods, semen, filled, the, tigris, once, agricultural, societies, emerged, the, sexual, framework, shifted, in, ways, that, persisted, for, many, millennia, in, much, of, asia, africa, europe, and, parts, of, the, americas, one, common, characteristic, new, to, these, societies, was, the, collective, supervision, of, sexual, behavior, due, to, urbanization, and, the, growth, of, population, and, population, density, children, would, commonly, witness, parents, having, sex, because, many, families, shared, the, same, sleeping, quarters, due, to, land, ownership, determination, of, children, s, paternity, became, important, and, society, and, family, life, became, patriarchal, these, changes, in, sexual, ideology, were, used, to, control, female, sexuality, and, to, differentiate, standards, by, gender, with, these, ideologies, sexual, possessiveness, and, increases, in, jealousy, emerged, while, retaining, the, precedents, of, earlier, civilizations, each, classical, civilization, established, a, somewhat, distinctive, approach, to, gender, artistic, expression, of, sexual, beauty, and, to, behaviors, such, as, homosexuality, some, of, these, distinctions, are, portrayed, in, sex, manuals, which, were, also, common, among, civilizations, in, china, greece, rome, persia, and, india, each, has, its, own, sexual, history, before, the, high, middle, ages, homosexual, acts, appear, to, have, been, ignored, or, tolerated, by, the, christian, church, during, the, 12th, century, hostility, toward, homosexuality, began, to, spread, throughout, religious, and, secular, institutions, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, viewed, as, a, pathology, during, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, revolution, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, many, changes, in, sexual, standards, occurred, new, artificial, birth, control, devices, such, as, the, condom, and, diaphragm, were, introduced, doctors, started, claiming, a, new, role, in, sexual, matters, urging, that, their, advice, was, crucial, to, sexual, morality, and, health, new, pornographic, industries, grew, and, japan, adopted, its, first, laws, against, homosexuality, in, western, societies, the, definition, of, homosexuality, was, constantly, changing, western, influence, on, other, cultures, became, more, prevalent, new, contacts, created, serious, issues, around, sexuality, and, sexual, traditions, there, were, also, major, shifts, in, sexual, behavior, during, this, period, puberty, began, occurring, at, younger, ages, so, a, new, focus, on, adolescence, as, a, time, of, sexual, confusion, and, danger, emerged, there, was, a, new, focus, on, the, purpose, of, marriage, it, was, increasing, regarded, as, being, for, love, rather, than, only, for, economics, and, reproduction, havelock, ellis, and, sigmund, freud, adopted, more, accepting, stances, toward, homosexuality, ellis, said, homosexuality, was, inborn, and, therefore, not, immoral, not, a, disease, and, that, many, homosexuals, made, significant, contributions, to, society, freud, wrote, that, all, human, beings, as, capable, of, becoming, either, heterosexual, or, homosexual, neither, orientation, was, assumed, to, be, innate, according, to, freud, a, person, s, orientation, depended, on, the, resolution, of, the, oedipus, complex, he, said, male, homosexuality, resulted, when, a, young, boy, had, an, authoritarian, rejecting, mother, and, turned, to, his, father, for, love, and, affection, and, later, to, men, in, general, he, said, female, homosexuality, developed, when, a, girl, loved, her, mother, and, identified, with, her, father, and, became, fixated, at, that, stage, alfred, kinsey, initiated, the, modern, era, of, sex, research, he, collected, data, from, questionnaires, given, to, his, students, at, indiana, university, but, then, switched, to, personal, interviews, about, sexual, behaviors, kinsey, and, his, colleagues, sampled, 5, 300, men, and, 5, 940, women, he, found, that, most, people, masturbated, that, many, engaged, in, oral, sex, that, women, are, capable, of, having, multiple, orgasms, and, that, many, men, had, had, some, type, of, homosexual, experience, in, their, lifetimes, before, william, masters, a, physician, and, virginia, johnson, a, behavioral, scientist, the, study, of, anatomy, and, physiological, studies, of, sex, was, still, limited, to, experiments, with, laboratory, animals, masters, and, johnson, started, to, directly, observe, and, record, the, physical, responses, in, humans, that, are, engaged, in, sexual, activity, under, laboratory, settings, they, observed, 10, 000, episodes, of, sexual, acts, between, 312, men, and, 382, women, this, led, to, methods, of, treating, clinical, problems, and, abnormalities, masters, and, johnson, opened, the, first, sex, therapy, clinic, in, 1965, in, 1970, they, described, their, therapeutic, techniques, in, their, book, human, sexual, inadequacy, the, first, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, published, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, classified, homosexuality, as, a, mental, illness, and, more, specifically, a, sociopathic, personality, disturbance, this, definition, remained, the, professional, understanding, of, homosexuality, until, 1973, when, the, american, psychiatric, association, removed, homosexuality, from, their, list, of, diagnoses, for, mental, disorders, through, her, research, of, heterosexual, and, homosexual, men, evelyn, hooker, revealed, that, there, was, no, correlation, between, homosexuality, and, psychological, maladjustment, and, her, findings, played, a, pivotal, role, in, shifting, the, scientific, community, away, from, the, perspective, that, homosexuality, was, something, that, needed, to, be, treated, or, cured, european, conquerors, colonists, discovered, that, many, non, european, cultures, had, expressions, of, sexuality, and, gender, which, differed, from, european, notion, of, heterosexual, cisnormativity, these, would, include, transgender, practices, in, 1516, vasco, n, ez, de, balboa, a, spanish, explorer, discovered, indigenous, people, in, central, america, among, whom, several, indigenous, men, who, dressed, like, women, and, had, sex, with, each, other, resulting, in, him, feeding, forty, of, these, men, to, his, dogs, for, having, non, gender, conforming, behaviors, and, sexuality, in, north, america, and, the, united, states, europeans, have, used, claims, of, sexual, immorality, to, justify, discrimination, against, racial, and, ethnic, minorities, scholars, also, study, the, ways, in, which, colonialism, has, affected, sexuality, today, and, argue, that, due, to, racism, and, slavery, it, has, been, dramatically, changed, from, the, way, it, had, previously, been, understood, in, her, book, carnal, knowledge, and, imperial, power, gender, race, and, morality, in, colonial, asia, laura, stoler, investigates, how, the, dutch, colonists, used, sexual, control, and, gender, specific, sexual, sanctions, to, distinguish, between, the, rulers, from, the, ruled, and, enforce, colonial, domination, onto, the, people, of, indonesia, in, america, there, are, 155, native, tribes, that, are, recorded, to, have, embraced, two, spirit, people, within, their, tribes, but, the, total, number, of, tribes, could, be, greater, than, what, is, documented, two, spirit, people, were, and, still, are, members, of, communities, who, do, not, fall, under, western, gender, categories, of, male, and, female, but, rather, under, a, third, gender, category, this, system, of, gender, contradicts, both, the, gender, binary, and, the, assertion, that, sex, and, gender, are, the, same, instead, of, conforming, to, traditional, roles, of, men, and, women, two, spirit, fill, a, special, niche, in, their, communities, for, example, two, spirited, people, are, commonly, revered, for, possessing, special, wisdom, and, spiritual, powers, two, spirited, people, also, can, take, part, in, marriages, either, monogamous, and, polygamous, ones, historically, european, colonizers, perceived, relationships, involving, two, spirited, people, as, homosexuality, and, therefore, believed, in, the, moral, inferiority, of, native, people, in, reaction, colonizers, began, to, impose, their, own, religious, and, social, norms, on, indigenous, communities, diminishing, the, role, of, two, spirit, people, in, native, cultures, within, reservations, the, religious, crime, code, of, the, 1880s, explicitly, aimed, to, aggressively, attack, native, sexual, and, marriage, practices, the, goal, of, colonizers, was, for, native, peoples, to, assimilate, into, euro, american, ideals, of, family, sexuality, gender, expression, and, more, the, link, between, constructed, sexual, meanings, and, racial, ideologies, has, been, studied, according, to, joane, nagel, sexual, meanings, are, constructed, to, maintain, racial, ethnic, national, boundaries, by, the, denigration, of, others, and, regulation, of, sexual, behavior, within, the, group, she, writes, both, adherence, to, and, deviation, from, such, approved, behaviors, define, and, reinforce, racial,

black, women, lotus, blossom, and, dragon, lady, for, asian, women, and, the, spicy, latina, these, stereotypes, contrast, with, standards, of, sexual, conservatism, creating, a, dichotomy, that, dehumanizes, and, demonizes, the, stereotyped, groups, an, example, of, a, stereotype, that, lies, at, the, intersection, of, racism, classism, and, misogyny, is, the, archetype, of, the, welfare, queen, cathy, cohen, describes, how, the, welfare, queen, stereotype, demonizes, poor, black, single, mothers, for, deviating, from, conventions, surrounding, family, structure, reproductive, and, sexual, rights, encompass, the, concept, of, applying, human, rights, to, issues, related, to, reproduction, and, sexuality, this, concept, is, a, modern, one, and, remains, controversial, since, it, deals, directly, and, indirectly, with, issues, such, as, contraception, lgbt, rights, abortion, sex, education, freedom, to, choose, a, partner, freedom, to, decide, whether, to, be, sexually, active, or, not, right, to, bodily, integrity, freedom, to, decide, whether, or, not, and, when, to, have, children, these, are, all, global, issues, that, exist, in, all, cultures, to, some, extent, but, manifest, differently, depending, on, the, specific, contexts, according, to, the, swedish, government, sexual, rights, include, the, right, of, all, people, to, decide, over, their, own, bodies, and, sexuality, and, reproductive, rights, comprise, the, right, of, individuals, to, decide, on, the, number, of, children, they, have, and, the, intervals, at, which, they, are, born, such, rights, are, not, accepted, in, all, cultures, with, practices, such, criminalization, of, consensual, sexual, activities, such, as, those, related, to, homosexual, acts, and, sexual, acts, outside, marriage, acceptance, of, forced, marriage, and, child, marriage, failure, to, criminalize, all, non, consensual, sexual, encounters, such, as, marital, rape, female, genital, mutilation, or, restricted, availability, of, contraception, being, common, around, the, world, in, 1915, emma, goldman, and, margaret, sanger, leaders, of, the, birth, control, movement, began, to, spread, information, regarding, contraception, in, opposition, to, the, laws, such, as, the, comstock, law, that, demonized, it, one, of, their, main, purposes, was, to, assert, that, the, birth, control, movement, was, about, empowering, women, with, personal, reproductive, and, economic, freedom, for, those, who, could, not, afford, to, parent, a, child, or, simply, did, not, want, one, goldman, and, sanger, saw, it, necessary, to, educate, people, as, contraceptives, were, quickly, being, stigmatized, as, a, population, control, tactic, due, to, being, a, policy, limiting, births, disregarding, that, this, limitation, did, not, target, ecological, political, or, large, economic, conditions, this, stigma, targeted, lower, class, women, who, had, the, most, need, of, access, to, contraception, birth, control, finally, began, to, lose, stigma, in, 1936, when, the, ruling, of, u, s, v, one, package, declared, that, prescribing, contraception, to, save, a, person, s, life, or, well, being, was, no, longer, illegal, under, the, comstock, law, although, opinions, varied, on, when, birth, control, should, be, available, to, women, by, 1938, there, were, 347, birth, control, clinics, in, the, united, states, but, advertising, their, services, remained, illegal, the, stigma, continued, to, lose, credibility, as, first, lady, eleanor, roosevelt, publicly, showed, her, support, for, birth, control, through, the, four, terms, her, husband, served, 1933, 1945, however, it, was, not, until, 1966, that, the, federal, government, began, to, fund, family, planning, and, subsidized, birth, control, services, for, lower, class, women, and, families, at, the, order, of, president, lyndon, b, johnson, this, funding, continued, after, 1970, under, the, family, planning, services, and, population, research, act, today, all, health, insurance, marketplace, plans, are, required, to, cover, all, forms, of, contraception, including, sterilization, procedures, as, a, result, of, the,

recordings, reveal, that, ronald, reagan, s, press, secretary, larry, speakes, viewed, the, epidemic, as, a, joke, mocking, aids, by, calling, it, the, gay, plague, the, epidemic, also, carried, stigma, coming, from, religious, influences, for, example, cardinal, krol, voiced, that, aids, was, an, act, of, vengeance, against, the, sin, of, homosexuality, which, clarifies, the, specific, meaning, behind, the, pope, s, mention, of, the, moral, source, of, aids, activism, during, the, aids, crisis, focused, on, promoting, safe, sex, practices, to, raise, awareness, that, the, disease, could, be, prevented, the, safe, sex, is, hot, sex, campaign, for, example, aimed, to, promote, the, use, of, condoms, campaigns, by, the, u, s, government, however, diverged, from, advocacy, of, safe, sex, in, 1987, congress, even, denied, federal, funding, from, awareness, campaigns, that, or, directly, or, indirectly, homosexual, activities, instead, campaigns, by, the, government, primarily, relied, on, scare, tactics, in, order, to, instill, fear, in, men, who, had, sex, with, other, men, in, addition, to, prevention, campaigns, activists, also, sought, to, counteract, narratives, that, led, to, the, social, death, for, people, living, with, aids, gay, men, from, san, francisco, and, new, york, city, created, the, denver, principles, a, foundational, document, that, demanded, the, rights, agency, and, dignity, of, people, living, with, aids, in, his, article, emergence, of, gay, identity, and, gay, social, movements, in, developing, countries, matthew, roberts, discusses, how, international, aids, prevention, campaigns, created, opportunities, for, gay, men, to, interact, with, other, openly, gay, men, from, other, countries, these, interactions, allowed, western, gay, culture, to, be, introduced, to, gay, men, in, countries, where, homosexuality, was, not, an, important, identifier, thus, group, organizers, self, identified, as, gay, more, and, more,

oxytocin, which, helps, people, bond, and, build, trust, some, of, these, benefits, such, as, stress, reduction, also, apply, to, masturbation, as, distinct, from, sexual, intercourse, with, another,

combination, of, the, person, possessing, the, traits, and, also, on, the, criteria, of, the, person, who, is, attracted, though, attempts, have, been, made, to, devise, objective, criteria, of,

more, attractive, than, one, of, the, other, sex, a, bisexual, person, would, find, either, sex, to, be, attractive, in, addition, there, are, asexual, people, who, usually, do, not, experience,

as, well, as, in, modeling, sex, work, and, other, occupations, globally, laws, regulate, human, sexuality, in, several, ways, including, criminalizing, particular, sexual, behaviors, granting, individuals, the, privacy, or, autonomy, to, make, their, own, sexual, decisions, protecting, individuals, with, regard, to, equality, and, non, discrimination, recognizing, and, protecting, other, individual, rights, as, well, as, legislating, matters, regarding, marriage, and, the, family, and, creating, laws, protecting, individuals, from, violence, harassment, and, persecution, in, the, united, states, there, are, two, fundamentally, different, approaches, applied, in, different, states, regarding, the, way, the, law, is, used, to, attempt, to, govern, a, person, s, sexuality, the, black, letter, approach, to, law, focuses, on, the, study, of, pre, existing, legal, precedent, and, attempts, to, offer, a, clear, framework, of, rules, within, which, lawyers, and, others, can, work, in, contrast, the, socio, legal, approach, focuses, more, broadly, on, the, relationship, between, the, law, and, society, and, offers, a, more, contextualized, view, of, the, relationship, between, legal, and, social, change, issues, regarding, human, sexuality, and, human, sexual, orientation, came, to, the, forefront, in, western, law, in, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, as, part, of, the, gay, liberation, movement, s, encouragement, of, lgbt, individuals, to, come, out, of, the, closet, and, engage, with, the, legal, system, primarily, through, courts, therefore, many, issues, regarding, human, sexuality, and, the, law, are, found, in, the, opinions, of, the, courts, while, the, issue, of, privacy, has, been, useful, to, sexual, rights, claims, some, scholars, have, criticized, its, usefulness, saying, that, this, perspective, is, too, narrow, and, restrictive, the, law, is, often, slow, to, intervene, in, certain, forms, of, coercive, behavior, that, can, limit, individuals, control, over, their, own, sexuality, such, as, female, genital, mutilation, forced, marriages, or, lack, of, access, to, reproductive, health, care, many, of, these, injustices, are, often, perpetuated, wholly, or, in, part, by, private, individuals, rather, than, state, agents, and, as, a, result, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, about, the, extent, of, state, responsibility, to, prevent, harmful, practices, and, to, investigate, such, practices, when, they, do, occur, state, intervention, with, regards, to, sexuality, also, occurs, and, is, considered, acceptable, by, some, in, certain, instances, e, g, same, sex, sexual, activity, or, prostitution, the, legal, systems, surrounding, prostitution, are, a, topic, of, debate, proponents, for, criminalization, argue, that, sex, work, is, an, immoral, practice, that, should, not, be, tolerated, while, proponents, for, decriminalization, point, out, how, criminalization, does, more, harm, than, good, within, the, feminist, movement, there, is, also, a, debate, over, whether, sex, work, is, inherently, objectifying, and, exploitative, or, whether, sex, workers, have, the, agency, to, sell, sex, as, a, service, when, sex, work, is, criminalized, sex, workers, do, not, have, support, from, law, enforcement, when, they, fall, victim, to, violence, in, a, 2003, survey, of, street, based, sex, workers, in, nyc, 80, said, they, had, been, threatened, with, or, experienced, violence, and, many, said, the, police, were, no, help, 27, said, they, had, experienced, violence, from, police, officers, themselves, different, identities, such, as, being, black, transgender, or, poor, can, result, in, a, person, being, more, likely, to, be, criminally, profiled, by, the, police, for, example, in, new, york, there, is, a, law, against, loitering, for, the, purpose, of, engaging, in, prostitution, which, has, been, nicknamed, the, walking, while, trans, law, because, of, how, often, transgender, women, are, assumed, to, be, sex, workers, and, arrested, for, simply, walking, out, in, public, in, some, religions, sexual, behavior, is, regarded, as, primarily, spiritual, in, others, it, is, treated, as, primarily, physical, some, hold, that, sexual, behavior, is, only, spiritual, within, certain, kinds, of, relationships, when, used, for, specific, purposes, or, when, incorporated, into, religious, ritual, in, some, religions, there, are, no, distinctions, between, the, physical, and, the, spiritual, whereas, some, religions, view, human, sexuality, as, a, way, of, completing, the, gap, that, exists, between, the, spiritual, and, the, physical, many, religious, conservatives, especially, those, of, abrahamic, religions, and, christianity, in, particular, tend, to, view, sexuality, in, terms, of, behavior, i, e, homosexuality, or, heterosexuality, is, what, someone, does, these, conservatives, tend, to, promote, celibacy, for, gay, people, and, may, also, tend, to, believe, that, sexuality, can, be, changed, through, conversion, therapy, or, prayer, to, become, an, ex, gay, they, may, also, see, homosexuality, as, a, form, of, mental, illness, something, that, ought, to, be, criminalized, an, immoral, abomination, caused, by, ineffective, parenting, and, view, same, sex, marriage, as, a, threat, to, society, on, the, other, hand, most, religious, liberals, define, sexuality, related, labels, in, terms, of, sexual, attraction, and, self, identification, they, may, also, view, same, sex, activity, as, morally, neutral, and, as, legally, acceptable, as, opposite, sex, activity, unrelated, to, mental, illness, genetically, or, environmentally, caused, but, not, as, the, result, of, bad, parenting, and, fixed, they, also, tend, to, be, more, in, favor, of, same, sex, marriage, according, to, judaism, sex, between, a, man, and, woman, within, marriage, is, sacred, and, should, be, regularly, enjoyed, celibacy, is, considered, sinful, desire, including, sexual, desire, and, lust, were, considered, immoral, and, sinful, according, to, some, authors, elaine, pagels, says, by, the, beginning, of, the, fifth, century, augustine, had, actually, declared, that, spontaneous, sexual, desire, is, the, proof, of, and, penalty, for, universal, original, sin, though, that, this, view, goes, against, most, of, his, christian, predecessors, according, to, jennifer, wright, knust, paul, framed, desire, a, force, christians, gained, control, over, whereas, non, christians, were, enslaved, by, it, and, he, also, said, the, bodies, of, christians, were, members, of, christ, s, body, and, thus, sexual, desire, must, be, eschewed, the, roman, catholic, church, teaches, that, sexuality, is, noble, and, worthy, and, has, a, unitive, and, procreative, end, for, this, reason, sexual, activity, s, ideal, should, occur, in, the, context, of, a, marriage, between, a, man, and, a, woman, and, open, to, the, possibility, of, life, pope, francis, teaches, in, amoris, laetitia, against, an, attitude, that, would, solve, everything, by, applying, general, rules, or, deriving, undue, conclusions, from, particular, theological, considerations, and, that, he, also, warns, that, not, all, discussions, of, doctrinal, moral, or, pastoral, issues, need, to, be, settled, by, interventions, of, the, magisterium, and, that, we, have, been, called, to, form, consciences, not, to, replace, them, the, church, has, authoritative, teachings, on, sexuality, found, in, the, catechism, the, church, places, primacy, of, conscience, especially, on, the, regulation, of, births, the, anglican, church, teaches, that, human, sexuality, is, a, gift, from, a, loving, god, designed, to, be, between, a, man, and, a, woman, in, a, monogamous, lifetime, union, of, marriage, it, also, views, singleness, and, dedicated, celibacy, as, christ, like, it, states, that, people, with, same, sex, attraction, are, loved, by, god, and, are, welcomed, as, full, members, of, the, body, of, christ, while, the, church, leadership, has, a, variety, of, views, in, regard, to, homosexual, expression, and, ordination, some, expressions, of, sexuality, are, considered, sinful, including, promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, pedophilia, predatory, sexual, behavior, and, sadomasochism, all, of, which, may, be, heterosexual, and, homosexual, adultery, violence, against, wives, and, female, circumcision, the, church, is, concerned, with, pressures, on, young, people, to, engage, sexually, and, encourages, abstinence, in, matters, of, sexuality, several, evangelical, churches, promote, the, virginity, pledge, among, young, evangelical, christians, who, are, invited, to, commit, themselves, during, a, public, ceremony, to, sexual, abstinence, until, christian, marriage, this, pledge, is, often, symbolized, by, a, purity, ring, in, evangelical, churches, young, adults, and, unmarried, couples, are, encouraged, to, marry, early, in, order, to, live, a, sexuality, according, to, the, will, of, god, although, some, churches, are, discreet, on, the, subject, other, evangelical, churches, in, united, states, and, switzerland, speak, of, a, satisfying, sexuality, as, a, gift, from, god, and, a, component, of, a, harmonious, christian, marriage, in, messages, during, worship, services, or, conferences, many, evangelical, books, and, websites, are, specialized, on, the, subject, the, perceptions, of, homosexuality, in, the, evangelical, churches, are, varied, they, range, from, liberal, through, moderate, to, conservative, the, christian, marriage, is, presented, by, some, churches, as, a, protection, against, sexual, misconduct, and, a, compulsory, step, to, obtain, a, position, of, responsibility, in, the, church, this, concept, however, has, been, challenged, by, numerous, sex, scandals, involving, married, evangelical, leaders, finally, evangelical, theologians, recalled, that, celibacy, should, be, more, valued, in, the, church, today, since, the, gift, of, celibacy, was, taught, and, lived, by, jesus, christ, and, paul, of, tarsus, in, islam,
