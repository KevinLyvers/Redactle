name, of, pasha, it, is, played, on, a, board, shaped, like, a, symmetrical, cross, a, player, s, pieces, move, around, the, board, based, upon, a, throw, of, six, or, seven, cowrie, shells, with, the, number, of, shells, resting, with, the, aperture, upward, indicating, the, number, of, spaces, to, move, the, name, of, the, game, is, derived, from, the, hindi, word, pacc, s, meaning, twenty, five, the, largest, score, that, can, be, thrown, with, the, cowrie, shells, thus, this, game, is, also, known, by, the, name, twenty, five, there, are, other, versions, of, this, game, where, the, largest, score, that, can, be, thrown, is, thirty, in, addition, to, chaupar, there, are, many, versions, of, the, game, barjis, barsis, is, popular, in, the, levant, mainly, syria, while, parch, s, is, another, version, popular, in, spain, and, northern, morocco, parqu, s, is, its, colombian, variant, parcheesi, sorry, and, ludo, are, among, the, many, westernised, commercial, versions, of, the, game, the, jeu, des, petits, chevaux, game, of, little, horses, is, played, in, france, and, mensch, rgere, dich, nicht, is, a, popular, german, variant, it, is, also, possible, that, this, game, led, to, the, development, of, the, korean, board, game, yunnori, through, the, ancient, kingdom, baekje, games, similar, to, chaupar, with, different, colour, schemes, along, with, dice, have, been, identified, from, the, iron, age, during, the, painted, grey, ware, period, from, sites, in, mathura, and, noh, 1100, 800, bc, cruciform, boards, have, been, depicted, from, art, reliefs, of, chandraketugarh, dated, to, 2nd, 1st, century, bc, a, 6th, or, 7th, century, representation, of, shiva, and, parvati, said, to, be, playing, chaupar, a, closely, related, game, in, fact, depicts, only, dice, and, not, the, distinctive, board, in, a, similar, period, a, board, identical, to, pachisi, was, discovered, in, the, ellora, cave, system, a, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, document, referencing, the, chinese, game, chupu, chinese, pinyin, ch, p, invented, in, western, india, and, spread, to, china, in, the, time, of, the, wei, dynasty, ad, 220, 265, may, relate, to, chaupar, but, the, actual, nature, of, the, chinese, game, which, may, be, more, closely, related, to, backgammon, is, uncertain, speculation, that, pachisi, derived, from, the, earlier, game, of, ashtapada, is, plausible, but, unsubstantiated, louis, rousselet, wrote, the, game, of, pachisi, was, played, by, akbar, in, a, truly, regal, manner, the, court, itself, divided, into, red, and, white, squares, being, the, board, and, an, enormous, stone, raised, on, four, feet, representing, the, central, point, it, was, here, that, akbar, and, his, courtiers, played, this, game, sixteen, young, slaves, from, the, harem, wearing, the, players, colours, represented, the, pieces, and, moved, to, the, squares, according, to, the, throw, of, the, dice, it, is, said, that, the, emperor, took, such, a, fancy, to, playing, the, game, on, this, grand, scale, that, he, had, a, court, for, pachisi, constructed, in, all, his, palaces, and, traces, of, such, are, still, visible, at, agra, and, allahabad, irving, finkel, adds, to, date, these, grandiose, boards, still, represent, the, earliest, secure, evidence, for, the, existence, of, the, game, in, india, the, game, s, role, in, the, history, of, india, still, remains, to, be, investigated, it, is, often, assumed, that, the, gambling, game, that, plays, so, significant, a, role, in, the, mahabharata, the, classical, literary, epic, is, pachisi, but, the, descriptions, such, as, they, are, do, not, tie, in, with, the, game, and, this, conclusion, is, perhaps, erroneous, in, 1938, the, american, toy, and, game, company, transogram, introduced, a, mass, market, board, game, version, called, game, of, india, later, marketed, as, pa, chiz, si, the, game, of, india, pachisi, is, a, game, for, two, three, or, four, players, four,

each, player, has, four, beehive, shaped, pieces, this, can, be, increased, to, up, to, 16, pieces, on, each, side, in, some, versions, the, pieces, of, one, player, are, distinguishable, from, another, by, their, colours, black, green, red, and, yellow, six, cowrie, shells, are, used, to, determine, the, amount, to, move, the, players, pieces, the, shells, are, thrown, from, the, player, s, hand, and, the, number, of, cowries, which, fall, with, their, openings, upwards, indicate, how, many, spaces, the, player, may, move, in, some, versions, seven, cowrie, shells, are, used, the, board, is, usually, embroidered, on, cloth, the, playing, area, is, cruciform, there, is, a, large, square, in, the, centre, called, the, charkoni, which, is, the, starting, and, finishing, position, of, the, pieces, the, four, arms, are, divided, into, three, columns, of, eight, squares, the, players, pieces, are, moved, along, these, columns, during, play, twelve, squares, are, specially, marked, as, castle, squares, four, of, these, are, positioned, at, the, end, of, the, middle, columns, of, each, arm, the, other, eight, are, four, squares, inwards, from, the, end, of, the, outer, columns, on, each, arm, a, piece, may, not, be, captured, by, an, opponent, while, it, lies, on, a, castle, square, each, player, s, objective, is, to, move, all, four, of, their, pieces, completely, around, the, board, counter, clockwise, before, their, opponents, do, the, pieces, start, and, finish, on, the, charkoni, the, playing, order, is, decided, by, each, player, throwing, the, cowries, the, player, with, the, highest, score, starts, and, turns, continue, counter, clockwise, around, the, board, in, some, versions, each, player, throws, the, cowrie, shells, and, pieces, cannot, move, until, a, 2, 3, or, 4, is, thrown, if, a, 6, 10, or, 25, is, thrown, the, player, gets, a, grace, which, enables, the, player, to, introduce, one, of, their, pieces, from, the, charkoni, onto, the, board, the, player, then, repeats, their, turn, in, other, versions, this, includes, 10, 25, or, 35, to, introduce, another, of, their, pieces, the, newly, introduced, pawn, will, be, landed, on, square, number, 1, which, is, the, very, first, square, for, every, respective, player, here, it, is, said, that, on, throwing, 10, or, 25, or, 35, you, will, introduce, your, new, pawn, at, square, number, 1, and, then, you, will, add, the, second, throw, numbers, that, will, be, appeared, on, your, cowries, and, 7, 14, as, a, grace, without, the, introduction, of, pieces, here, it, should, be, clear, to, players, that, on, throwing, 7, or, 14, you, can, not, introduce, your, new, pawn, you, only, get, an, extra, turn, a, player, needs, to, have, at, least, one, piece, on, the, board, to, be, able, to, throw, a, 7, or, 14, simply, put, on, throwing, 10, or, 25, or, 35, you, can, not, introduce, your, new, pawn, directly, to, 10, or, 25, or, 35, number, square, directly, you, have, to, land, the, new, pawn, on, square, number, 1, and, then, add, your, remaining, numbers, once, your, all, pawns, have, entered, the, game, throwing, 10, or, 25, or, 35, allows, you, to, move, the, respective, numbers, ahead, each, player, s, first, piece, may, leave, the, charkoni, on, any, throw, after, it, has, been, introduced, onto, the, board, each, player, moves, their, pieces, down, the, centre, column, of, their, own, arm, of, the, board, then, counter, clockwise, around, the, outside, columns, a, player, may, have, any, number, of, pieces, on, the, board, at, one, time, only, one, piece, may, be, moved, with, a, single, throw, or, if, the, player, chooses, they, can, decline, to, move, any, piece, on, a, throw, in, some, versions, a, player, can, move, any, number, of, their, pieces, with, a, single, throw, also, if, the, player, casts, a, value, higher, than, they, are, eligible, to, move, in, a, single, throw, then, the, player, automatically, loses, that, turn, more, than, one, piece, of, the, same, team, may, occupy, a, single, square, not, true, for, all, squares, in, some, versions, however, a, piece, may, not, move, onto, a, castle, square, that, is, already, occupied, by, an, opponent, s, piece, if, a, piece, lands, on, a, square, other, than, a, castle, square, occupied, by, any, number, of, the, opponent, s, pieces, those, pieces, are, captured, killed, and, must, return, to, the, charkoni, captured, pieces, may, only, enter, the, game, again, with, a, grace, throw, a, player, making, a, capture, is, allowed, another, turn, not, true, in, some, versions, in, some, versions, a, player, cannot, take, their, pieces, back, to, the, charkoni, home, unless, they, have, captured, killed, at, least, one, of, the, opponent, s, pieces, some, versions, have, a, rule, where, if, for, example, two, players, are, playing, against, each, other, and, player, 1, captures, a, piece, of, player, 2, then, player, 2, in, their, immediate, turn, after, being, captured, for, the, first, time, captures, the, same, piece, player, 1, just, used, to, capture, in, the, same, square, where, the, capture, took, place, then, player, 1, s, capture, kill, is, invalidated, player, 1, will, need, to, recapture, player, 2, s, piece, again, to, be, able, to, go, back, to, the, charkoni, but, player, 2, is, free, to, go, ahead, to, their, respective, charkoni, unless, the, above, repeats, a, piece, completes, its, trip, around, the, board, by, moving, back, up, its, central, column, returning, pieces, may, be, placed, on, their, side, in, order, to, distinguish, them, from, pieces, that, have, just, entered, a, piece, can, only, return, to, the, charkoni, by, a, direct, throw, four, of, the, castle, squares, are, placed, so, they, are, exactly, 25, moves, from, the, charkoni, a, common, strategy, is, for, returning, pieces, to, stay, on, these, squares, where, they, are, safe, from, capture, until, a, 25, is, thrown, the, pieces, can, then, finish, the, game, directly, this, is, where, the, name, of, the, game, comes, from, in, some, versions, where, more, emphasis, is, put, on, the, throwing, of, the, cowries, experienced, players, can, cause, cowries, to, land, in, a, specific, way, so, there, are, certain, other, rules, to, make, the, game, more, exciting
