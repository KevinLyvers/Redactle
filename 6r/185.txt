polygamy, from, late, greek, polygam, a, state, of, marriage, to, many, spouses, is, the, practice, of, marrying, multiple, spouses, when, a, man, is, married, to, more, than, one, wife, at, the, same, time, it, is, called, polygyny, when, a, woman, is, married, to, more, than, one, husband, at, the, same, time, it, is, called, polyandry, in, sociobiology, and, zoology, researchers, use, polygamy, in, a, broad, sense, to, mean, any, form, of, multiple, mating, in, contrast, to, polygamy, monogamy, is, marriage, consisting, of, only, two, parties, like, monogamy, the, term, polygamy, is, often, used, in, a, de, facto, sense, applied, regardless, of, whether, a, state, recognizes, the, relationship, in, many, countries, the, law, only, recognises, monogamous, marriages, a, person, can, only, have, one, spouse, and, bigamy, is, illegal, but, adultery, is, not, illegal, leading, to, a, situation, of, de, facto, polygamy, being, allowed, without, legal, recognition, for, non, official, spouses, worldwide, different, societies, variously, encourage, accept, or, outlaw, polygamy, in, societies, which, allow, or, tolerate, polygamy, polygyny, is, the, accepted, form, in, the, vast, majority, of, cases, according, to, the, ethnographic, atlas, codebook, of, 1, 231, societies, noted, between, from, 1960, to, 1980, 588, had, frequent, polygyny, 453, had, occasional, polygyny, 186, were, monogamous, and, 4, had, polyandry, although, more, recent, research, found, some, form, of, polyandry, in, 53, communities, which, is, more, common, than, previously, thought, in, cultures, which, practice, polygamy, its, prevalence, among, that, population, often, correlates, with, social, class, and, socioeconomic, status, polygamy, taking, the, form, of, polygyny, is, most, common, in, a, region, known, as, the, polygamy, belt, in, west, africa, and, central, africa, with, the, countries, estimated, to, have, the, highest, polygamy, prevalence, in, the, world, being, burkina, faso, mali, gambia, niger, and, nigeria, the, term, polygamy, may, be, referring, to, one, of, various, relational, types, depending, upon, context, four, overlapping, definitions, can, be, adapted, from, the, work, of, ulrich, reichard, and, others, biologists, biological, anthropologists, and, behavioral, ecologists, often, use, polygamy, in, the, sense, of, a, lack, of, sexual, or, genetic, reproductive, exclusivity, when, cultural, or, social, anthropologists, and, other, social, scientists, use, the, term, polygamy, the, meaning, is, social, or, marital, polygamy, in, contrast, marital, monogamy, may, be, distinguished, between, outside, of, the, legal, sphere, defining, polygamy, can, be, difficult, because, of, differences, in, cultural, assumptions, regarding, monogamy, some, societies, believe, that, monogamy, requires, limiting, sexual, activity, to, a, single, partner, for, life, others, accept, or, endorse, pre, marital, sex, prior, to, marriage, some, societies, consider, sex, outside, of, marriage, or, spouse, swapping, to, be, socially, acceptable, some, consider, a, relationship, monogamous, even, if, partners, separate, and, move, to, a, new, monogamous, relationship, through, death, divorce, or, simple, dissolution, of, the, relationship, regardless, of, the, length, of, the, relationship, serial, monogamy, anthropologists, characterize, human, beings, as, mildly, polygynous, or, monogamous, with, polygynous, tendencies, the, average, pre, historic, man, with, modern, descendants, appears, to, have, had, children, with, between, 1, 5, women, 70, 000, years, ago, to, 3, 3, women, 45, 000, years, ago, except, in, east, asia, while, the, forms, of, non, monogamy, in, prehistorical, times, is, unknown, these, rates, could, be, consistent, with, a, society, that, practices, serial, monogamy, anthropological, observations, indicate, that, even, when, polygyny, is, accepted, in, the, community, the, majority, of, relationships, in, the, society, are, monogamous, in, practice, while, couples, remain, in, the, relationship, which, may, not, be, lifelong, thus, in, many, historical, communities, serial, monogamy, may, have, been, the, accepted, practice, rather, than, a, lifelong, monogamous, bond, the, genetic, record, indicates, that, monogamy, increased, within, the, last, 5, 000, 10, 000, years, a, period, associated, with, the, development, of, human, agriculture, non, communal, land, ownership, and, inheritance, polygamy, exists, in, three, specific, forms, polygyny, the, practice, wherein, a, man, has, more, than, one, wife, at, the, same, time, is, by, far, the, most, common, form, of, polygamy, many, muslim, majority, countries, and, some, countries, with, sizable, muslim, minorities, accept, polygyny, to, varying, extents, both, legally, and, culturally, in, several, countries, such, as, india, the, law, only, recognizes, polygamous, marriages, for, the, muslim, population, islamic, law, or, sharia, is, a, religious, law, forming, part, of, the, islamic, tradition, which, allows, polygyny, it, is, derived, from, the, religious, precepts, of, islam, particularly, the, quran, and, the, hadith, in, arabic, the, term, shar, ah, refers, to, god, s, arabic, all, h, immutable, divine, law, and, is, contrasted, with, fiqh, which, refers, to, its, human, scholarly, interpretations, polygyny, is, more, widespread, in, africa, than, on, any, other, continent, especially, in, west, africa, and, some, scholars, see, the, slave, trade, s, impact, on, the, male, to, female, sex, ratio, as, a, key, factor, in, the, emergence, and, fortification, of, polygynous, practices, in, regions, of, africa, in, the, region, of, sub, saharan, africa, polygyny, is, common, and, deeply, rooted, in, the, culture, with, 11, of, the, population, of, sub, saharan, africa, living, in, such, marriages, 25, of, the, muslim, population, and, 3, of, the, christian, population, as, of, 2019, according, to, pew, polygamy, is, widespread, in, a, cluster, of, countries, in, west, and, central, africa, including, burkina, faso, 36, mali, 34, and, nigeria, 28, anthropologist, jack, goody, s, comparative, study, of, marriage, around, the, world, utilizing, the, ethnographic, atlas, demonstrated, a, historical, correlation, between, the, practice, of, extensive, shifting, horticulture, and, polygamy, in, the, majority, of, sub, saharan, african, societies, drawing, on, the, work, of, ester, boserup, goody, notes, that, the, sexual, division, of, labour, varies, between, the, male, dominated, intensive, plough, agriculture, common, in, eurasia, and, the, extensive, shifting, horticulture, found, in, sub, saharan, africa, in, some, of, the, sparsely, populated, regions, where, shifting, cultivation, takes, place, in, africa, women, do, much, of, the, work, this, favours, polygamous, marriages, in, which, men, seek, to, monopolize, the, production, of, women, who, are, valued, both, as, workers, and, as, child, bearers, goody, however, observes, that, the, correlation, is, imperfect, and, varied, and, also, discusses, more, traditionally, male, dominated, though, relatively, extensive, farming, systems, such, as, those, traditionally, common, in, much, of, west, africa, especially, in, the, west, african, savanna, where, more, agricultural, work, is, done, by, men, and, where, polygyny, is, desired, by, men, more, for, the, generation, of, male, offspring, whose, labor, is, valued, anthropologists, douglas, r, white, and, michael, l, burton, discuss, and, support, jack, goody, s, observation, regarding, african, male, farming, systems, in, causes, of, polygyny, ecology, economy, kinship, and, warfare, 884, where, these, authors, note, goody, 1973, argues, against, the, female, contributions, hypothesis, he, notes, dorjahn, s, 1959, comparison, of, east, and, west, africa, showing, higher, female, agricultural, contributions, in, east, africa, and, higher, polygyny, rates, in, west, africa, especially, the, west, african, savanna, where, one, finds, especially, high, male, agricultural, contributions, goody, says, the, reasons, behind, polygyny, are, sexual, and, reproductive, rather, than, economic, and, productive, 1973, 189, arguing, that, men, marry, polygynously, to, maximize, their, fertility, and, to, obtain, large, households, containing, many, young, dependent, males, 873, an, analysis, by, james, fenske, 2012, found, that, child, mortality, and, ecologically, related, economic, shocks, had, a, significant, association, with, rates, of, polygamy, in, sub, saharan, africa, rather, than, female, agricultural, contributions, which, are, typically, relatively, small, in, the, west, african, savanna, and, sahel, where, polygyny, rates, are, higher, finding, that, polygyny, rates, decrease, significantly, with, child, mortality, rates, polygynous, marriages, fall, into, two, types, sororal, polygyny, in, which, the, co, wives, are, sisters, and, non, sororal, where, the, co, wives, are, not, related, polygyny, offers, husbands, the, benefit, of, allowing, them, to, have, more, children, may, provide, them, with, a, larger, number, of, productive, workers, where, workers, are, family, and, allows, them, to, establish, politically, useful, ties, with, a, greater, number, of, kin, groups, senior, wives, can, benefit, as, well, when, the, addition, of, junior, wives, to, the, family, lightens, their, workload, wives, especially, senior, wives, status, in, a, community, can, increase, through, the, addition, of, other, wives, who, add, to, the, family, s, prosperity, or, symbolize, conspicuous, consumption, much, as, a, large, house, domestic, help, or, expensive, vacations, operate, in, a, western, country, for, such, reasons, senior, wives, sometimes, work, hard, or, contribute, from, their, own, resources, to, enable, their, husbands, to, accumulate, the, bride, price, for, an, extra, wife, polygyny, may, also, result, from, the, practice, of, levirate, marriage, in, such, cases, the, deceased, man, s, heir, may, inherit, his, assets, and, wife, or, more, usually, his, brothers, may, marry, the, widow, this, provides, support, for, the, widow, and, her, children, usually, also, members, of, the, brothers, kin, group, and, maintains, the, tie, between, the, husbands, and, wives, kin, groups, the, sororate, resembles, the, levirate, in, that, a, widower, must, marry, the, sister, of, his, dead, wife, the, family, of, the, late, wife, in, other, words, must, provide, a, replacement, for, her, thus, maintaining, the, marriage, alliance, both, levirate, and, sororate, may, result, in, a, man, having, multiple, wives, in, monogamous, societies, wealthy, and, powerful, men, may, establish, enduring, relationships, with, and, established, separate, household, for, multiple, female, partners, aside, from, their, legitimate, wives, a, practice, accepted, in, imperial, china, up, until, the, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1912, this, constitutes, a, form, of, de, facto, polygyny, referred, to, as, concubinage, marriage, is, the, moment, at, which, a, new, household, is, formed, but, different, arrangements, may, occur, depending, upon, the, type, of, marriage, and, some, polygamous, marriages, do, not, result, in, the, formation, of, a, single, household, in, many, polygynous, marriages, the, husband, s, wives, may, live, in, separate, households, they, can, thus, be, described, as, a, series, of, linked, nuclear, families, with, a, father, in, common, polyandry, the, practice, of, a, woman, having, more, than, one, husband, at, one, time, is, much, less, prevalent, than, polygyny, it, is, specifically, provided, in, the, legal, codes, of, some, countries, such, as, gabon, polyandry, is, believed, to, be, more, common, in, societies, with, scarce, environmental, resources, as, it, is, believed, to, limit, human, population, growth, and, enhance, child, survival, it, is, a, rare, form, of, marriage, that, exists, not, only, among, poor, families, but, also, the, elite, for, example, in, the, himalayan, mountains, polyandry, is, related, to, the, scarcity, of, land, the, marriage, of, all, brothers, in, a, family, to, the, same, wife, allows, family, land, to, remain, intact, and, undivided, if, every, brother, married, separately, and, had, children, family, land, would, be, split, into, unsustainable, small, plots, in, europe, this, outcome, was, avoided, through, the, social, practice, of, impartible, inheritance, under, which, most, siblings, would, be, disinherited, fraternal, polyandry, was, traditionally, practiced, among, nomadic, tibetans, in, nepal, parts, of, china, and, part, of, northern, india, in, which, two, or, more, brothers, would, marry, the, same, woman, it, is, most, common, in, societies, marked, by, high, male, mortality, it, is, associated, with, partible, paternity, the, cultural, belief, that, a, child, can, have, more, than, one, father, non, fraternal, polyandry, occurs, when, the, wives, husbands, are, unrelated, as, among, the, nayar, tribe, of, india, where, girls, undergo, a, ritual, marriage, before, puberty, and, the, first, husband, is, acknowledged, as, the, father, of, all, her, children, however, the, woman, may, never, cohabit, with, that, man, taking, multiple, lovers, instead, these, men, must, acknowledge, the, paternity, of, their, children, and, hence, demonstrate, that, no, caste, prohibitions, have, been, breached, by, paying, the, midwife, the, women, remain, in, their, maternal, home, living, with, their, brothers, and, property, is, passed, matrilineally, a, similar, form, of, matrilineal, de, facto, polyandry, can, be, found, in, the, institution, of, walking, marriage, among, the, mosuo, tribe, of, china, serial, monogamy, refers, to, remarriage, after, divorce, or, death, of, a, spouse, from, a, monogamous, marriage, i, e, multiple, marriages, but, only, one, legal, spouse, at, a, time, a, series, of, monogamous, relationships, according, to, danish, scholar, miriam, k, zeitzen, anthropologists, treat, serial, monogamy, in, which, divorce, and, remarriage, occur, as, a, form, of, polygamy, as, it, also, can, establish, a, series, of, households, that, may, continue, to, be, tied, by, shared, paternity, and, shared, income, as, such, they, are, similar, to, the, household, formations, created, through, divorce, and, serial, monogamy, serial, monogamy, creates, a, new, kind, of, relative, the, ex, the, ex, wife, for, example, can, remain, an, active, part, of, her, ex, husband, s, life, as, they, may, be, tied, together, by, legally, or, informally, mandated, economic, support, which, can, last, for, years, including, by, alimony, child, support, and, joint, custody, bob, simpson, the, british, social, anthropologist, notes, that, it, creates, an, extended, family, by, tying, together, a, number, of, households, including, mobile, children, he, says, that, britons, may, have, ex, wives, or, ex, brothers, in, law, but, not, an, ex, child, according, to, him, these, unclear, families, do, not, fit, the, mold, of, the, monogamous, nuclear, family, group, marriage, is, a, non, monogamous, marriage, like, arrangement, where, three, or, more, adults, live, together, all, considering, themselves, partners, sharing, finances, children, and, household, responsibilities, polyamory, is, on, a, continuum, of, family, bonds, that, includes, group, marriage, the, term, does, not, refer, to, bigamy, as, no, claim, to, being, married, in, formal, legal, terms, is, made, scientific, studies, classify, humans, as, mildly, polygynous, or, monogamous, with, polygynous, tendencies, as, mentioned, above, data, from, 1960, to, 1980, in, the, ethnographic, atlas, codebook, indicated, that, polygamy, was, common, a, separate, 1988, review, examined, the, practices, of, 849, societies, from, before, western, imperialism, and, colonization, the, review, found, that, 708, of, the, societies, 83, accepted, polygyny, only, 16, were, monogamous, and, 1, polyandrous, subsequent, evidence, in, 2012, found, that, polyandry, in, which, women, have, multiple, male, partners, was, likely, in, pre, history, it, also, identified, 53, communities, studied, between, 1912, and, 2010, with, either, formal, or, informal, polyandry, indicating, that, polyandry, was, more, common, worldwide, than, previously, believed, the, authors, found, that, polyandry, was, most, common, in, egalitarian, societies, and, suspected, contributors, to, polyandry, included, fewer, men, due, to, the, existence, or, threat, of, high, adult, male, mortality, or, absence, travel, and, higher, male, contributions, towards, food, production, polyandry, still, appears, to, occur, in, the, minority, of, societies, regardless, of, the, type, of, polygamy, even, when, polygyny, is, accepted, in, the, community, the, majority, of, relationships, in, the, society, are, monogamous, in, practice, while, couples, remain, in, the, relationship, which, may, not, be, lifelong, in, many, historical, communities, serial, monogamy, may, have, been, the, accepted, practice, rather, than, a, lifelong, monogamous, bond, how, monogamy, is, defined, when, it, comes, to, accepted, sexual, activity, outside, of, the, relationship, however, may, differ, by, society, recent, anthropological, data, suggest, that, the, modern, concept, of, life, long, monogamy, has, been, in, place, for, only, the, last, 1, 000, years, genetic, evidence, has, demonstrated, that, a, greater, proportion, of, men, began, contributing, to, the, genetic, pool, between, 5, 000, and, 10, 000, years, ago, which, suggests, that, reproductive, monogamy, became, more, common, at, that, time, this, would, correspond, to, the, neolithic, agricultural, revolution, during, this, time, formerly, nomadic, societies, began, to, claim, and, settle, land, for, farming, leading, to, the, advent, of, property, ownership, and, therefore, inheritance, men, would, therefore, seek, to, ensure, that, their, land, would, go, to, direct, descendants, and, had, a, vested, interest, in, limiting, the, sexual, activities, of, their, reproductive, partners, it, is, possible, that, the, concept, of, marriage, and, permanent, monogamy, evolved, at, this, time, other, scientific, arguments, for, monogamy, prior, to, 2003, were, based, on, characteristics, of, reproductive, physiology, such, as, sperm, competition, sexual, selection, in, primates, and, body, size, characteristics, a, 2019, synthesis, of, these, and, other, data, found, that, the, weight, of, the, evidence, supports, a, mating, bond, that, may, include, polygyny, or, polyandry, but, is, most, likely, to, be, predominantly, serial, monogamy, more, recent, genetic, data, has, clarified, that, in, most, regions, throughout, history, a, smaller, proportion, of, men, contributed, to, human, genetic, history, compared, to, women, assuming, an, equal, number, of, men, and, women, are, born, and, survive, to, reproduce, this, would, indicate, that, historically, only, a, subset, of, men, fathered, children, and, did, so, with, multiple, women, and, may, suggest, that, many, men, either, did, not, procreate, or, did, not, have, children, that, survived, to, create, modern, ancestors, this, circumstance, could, occur, for, several, reasons, but, there, are, three, common, interpretations, the, serial, monogamy, interpretation, of, genetic, history, would, be, congruent, with, other, findings, such, as, the, fact, that, humans, form, pair, bonds, although, not, necessarily, for, life, and, that, human, fathers, invest, in, at, least, the, early, upbringing, of, their, children, serial, monogamy, would, also, be, consistent, with, the, existence, of, a, honeymoon, period, a, period, of, intense, interest, in, a, single, sexual, partner, with, less, interest, in, other, women, which, may, help, to, keep, men, invested, in, staying, with, the, mother, of, their, child, for, this, period, when, reciprocated, this, honeymoon, period, lasts, 18, months, to, three, years, in, most, cases, this, would, correspond, to, the, period, necessary, to, bring, a, child, to, relative, independence, in, the, traditionally, small, interdependent, communal, societies, of, pre, neolithic, humans, before, they, settled, into, agricultural, communities, while, genetic, evidence, typically, displays, a, bias, towards, a, smaller, number, of, men, reproducing, with, more, women, some, regions, or, time, periods, have, shown, the, opposite, in, a, 2019, investigation, musharoff, et, al, applied, modern, techniques, to, the, 1000, genomes, project, phase, 3, high, coverage, complete, genomics, whole, genome, dataset, they, found, that, the, southern, han, chinese, had, a, male, bias, 45, female, indicating, that, women, were, likely, to, reproduce, with, multiple, men, this, region, is, known, for, its, lack, of, a, concept, of, paternity, and, for, a, sense, of, female, equality, or, superiority, the, musharoff, study, also, found, a, male, bias, in, europeans, 20, female, during, an, out, of, africa, migration, event, that, may, have, increased, the, number, of, men, successfully, reproducing, with, women, perhaps, by, replenishing, the, genetic, pool, in, europe, the, study, did, confirm, a, more, typical, female, bias, in, yorubans, 63, female, europeans, 84, punjabis, 82, and, peruvians, 56, buddhism, does, not, regard, marriage, as, a, sacrament, it, is, purely, a, secular, affair, normally, buddhist, monks, do, not, participate, in, it, though, in, some, sects, priests, and, monks, do, marry, hence, marriage, receives, no, religious, sanction, forms, of, marriage, in, consequence, vary, from, country, to, country, the, parabhava, sutta, states, that, a, man, who, is, not, satisfied, with, one, woman, and, seeks, out, other, women, is, on, the, path, to, decline, other, fragments, in, the, buddhist, scripture, seem, to, treat, polygamy, unfavorably, leading, some, authors, to, conclude, that, buddhism, generally, does, not, approve, of, it, or, alternatively, regards, it, as, a, tolerated, but, subordinate, marital, model, polygamy, in, thailand, was, legally, recognized, until, 1935, polygamy, in, myanmar, was, outlawed, in, 2015, in, sri, lanka, polyandry, was, legal, in, the, kingdom, of, kandy, but, outlawed, by, british, after, conquering, the, kingdom, in, 1815, when, the, buddhist, texts, were, translated, into, chinese, the, concubines, of, others, were, added, to, the, list, of, inappropriate, partners, polyandry, in, tibet, was, traditionally, common, as, was, polygyny, and, having, several, wives, or, husbands, was, never, regarded, as, having, sex, with, inappropriate, partners, most, typically, fraternal, polyandry, is, practiced, but, sometimes, father, and, son, have, a, common, wife, which, is, a, unique, family, structure, in, the, world, other, forms, of, marriage, are, also, present, like, group, marriage, and, monogamous, marriage, polyandry, especially, fraternal, polyandry, is, also, common, in, tibet, some, pre, christian, celtic, pagans, were, known, to, practice, polygamy, although, the, celtic, peoples, wavered, between, it, monogamy, and, polyandry, depending, on, the, time, period, and, the, area, in, some, areas, this, continued, even, after, christianization, began, for, instance, the, brehon, laws, of, gaelic, ireland, explicitly, allowed, for, polygamy, especially, amongst, the, noble, class, some, modern, celtic, pagan, religions, accept, the, practice, of, polygamy, to, varying, degrees, though, how, widespread, the, practice, is, within, these, religions, is, unknown, although, the, old, testament, describes, numerous, examples, of, polygamy, among, devotees, to, god, most, christian, groups, have, rejected, the, practice, of, polygamy, and, have, upheld, monogamy, alone, as, normative, nevertheless, some, christians, groups, in, different, periods, have, practiced, or, currently, do, practice, polygamy, some, christians, actively, debate, whether, the, new, testament, or, christian, ethics, allows, or, forbids, polygamy, although, the, new, testament, is, largely, silent, on, the, subject, of, polygamy, some, point, to, jesus, s, repetition, of, the, earlier, scriptures, noting, that, a, man, and, a, wife, shall, become, one, flesh, however, some, look, to, paul, s, writings, to, the, corinthians, do, you, not, know, that, he, who, is, joined, to, a, prostitute, becomes, one, body, with, her, for, as, it, is, written, the, two, will, become, one, flesh, supporters, of, polygamy, claim, that, this, verse, indicates, that, the, term, refers, to, a, physical, rather, than, a, spiritual, union, some, christian, theologians, argue, that, in, matthew, 19, 3, 9, and, referring, to, genesis, 2, 24, jesus, explicitly, states, a, man, should, have, only, one, wife, have, ye, not, read, that, he, which, made, them, at, the, beginning, made, them, male, and, female, and, said, for, this, cause, shall, a, man, leave, father, and, mother, and, shall, cleave, to, his, wife, and, they, twain, shall, be, one, flesh, 1, timothy, 3, 2, states, now, a, bishop, must, be, above, reproach, married, only, once, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an, apt, teacher, see, verse, 12, regarding, deacons, having, only, one, wife, similar, counsel, is, repeated, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, epistle, to, titus, periodically, christian, reform, movements, that, have, sought, to, rebuild, christian, doctrine, based, on, the, bible, alone, sola, scriptura, have, temporarily, accepted, polygyny, as, a, biblical, practice, for, example, during, the, protestant, reformation, in, a, document, which, was, simply, referred, to, as, der, beichtrat, or, the, confessional, advice, martin, luther, granted, the, landgrave, philip, of, hesse, who, for, many, years, had, been, living, constantly, in, a, state, of, adultery, and, fornication, a, dispensation, to, take, a, second, wife, the, double, marriage, was, to, be, done, in, secret, however, to, avoid, public, scandal, some, fifteen, years, earlier, in, a, letter, to, the, saxon, chancellor, gregor, br, ck, luther, stated, that, he, could, not, forbid, a, person, to, marry, several, wives, for, it, does, not, contradict, scripture, ego, sane, fateor, me, non, posse, prohibere, si, quis, plures, velit, uxores, ducere, nec, repugnat, sacris, literis, in, sub, saharan, africa, tensions, have, frequently, erupted, between, advocates, of, the, christian, insistence, on, monogamy, and, advocates, of, the, traditional, practice, of, polygamy, for, instance, mswati, iii, the, christian, king, of, eswatini, has, 15, wives, in, some, instances, in, recent, times, there, have, been, moves, for, accommodation, in, other, instances, churches, have, strongly, resisted, such, moves, african, independent, churches, have, sometimes, referred, to, those, parts, of, the, old, testament, that, describe, polygamy, in, defense, of, the, practice, the, illegality, of, polygamy, in, certain, areas, creates, according, to, certain, bible, passages, additional, arguments, against, it, paul, the, apostle, writes, submit, to, the, authorities, not, only, because, of, possible, punishment, but, also, because, of, conscience, romans, 13, 5, for, the, authorities, that, exist, have, been, established, by, god, romans, 13, 1, st, peter, concurs, when, he, says, to, submit, yourselves, for, the, lord, s, sake, to, every, authority, instituted, among, men, whether, to, the, king, as, the, supreme, authority, or, to, governors, who, are, sent, by, him, to, punish, those, who, do, wrong, and, to, commend, those, who, do, right, 1, peter, 2, 13, 14, pro, polygamists, argue, that, as, long, as, polygamists, currently, do, not, obtain, legal, marriage, licenses, nor, seek, common, law, marriage, status, for, additional, spouses, no, enforced, laws, are, being, broken, any, more, than, when, monogamous, couples, similarly, co, habitate, without, a, marriage, license, the, roman, catholic, church, condemns, polygamy, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, lists, it, in, paragraph, 2387, under, the, head, other, offenses, against, the, dignity, of, marriage, and, states, that, it, is, not, in, accord, with, the, moral, law, also, in, paragraph, 1645, under, the, head, the, goods, and, requirements, of, conjugal, love, states, the, unity, of, marriage, distinctly, recognized, by, our, lord, is, made, clear, in, the, equal, personal, dignity, which, must, be, accorded, to, husband, and, wife, in, mutual, and, unreserved, affection, polygamy, is, contrary, to, conjugal, love, which, is, undivided, and, exclusive, saint, augustine, saw, a, conflict, with, old, testament, polygamy, he, refrained, from, judging, the, patriarchs, but, did, not, deduce, from, their, practice, the, ongoing, acceptability, of, polygyny, on, the, contrary, he, argued, that, the, polygamy, of, the, fathers, which, was, tolerated, by, the, creator, because, of, fertility, was, a, diversion, from, his, original, plan, for, human, marriage, augustine, wrote, that, the, good, purpose, of, marriage, however, is, better, promoted, by, one, husband, with, one, wife, than, by, a, husband, with, several, wives, is, shown, plainly, enough, by, the, very, first, union, of, a, married, pair, which, was, made, by, the, divine, being, himself, augustine, taught, that, the, reason, patriarchs, had, many, wives, was, not, because, of, fornication, but, because, they, wanted, more, children, he, supported, his, premise, by, showing, that, their, marriages, in, which, husband, was, the, head, were, arranged, according, to, the, rules, of, good, management, those, who, are, in, command, quae, principantur, in, their, society, were, always, singular, while, subordinates, subiecta, were, multiple, he, gave, two, examples, of, such, relationships, dominus, servus, master, servant, in, older, translation, slave, and, god, soul, the, bible, often, equates, worshiping, multiple, gods, i, e, idolatry, to, fornication, augustine, relates, to, that, on, this, account, there, is, no, true, god, of, souls, save, one, but, one, soul, by, means, of, many, false, gods, may, commit, fornication, but, not, be, made, fruitful, as, tribal, populations, grew, fertility, was, no, longer, a, valid, justification, of, polygamy, it, was, lawful, among, the, ancient, fathers, whether, it, be, lawful, now, also, i, would, not, hastily, pronounce, utrum, et, nunc, fas, sit, non, temere, dixerim, for, there, is, not, now, necessity, of, begetting, children, as, there, then, was, when, even, when, wives, bear, children, it, was, allowed, in, order, to, a, more, numerous, posterity, to, marry, other, wives, in, addition, which, now, is, certainly, not, lawful, augustine, saw, marriage, as, a, covenant, between, one, man, and, one, woman, which, may, not, be, broken, it, was, the, creator, who, established, monogamy, therefore, the, first, natural, bond, of, human, society, is, man, and, wife, such, marriage, was, confirmed, by, the, saviour, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, mat, 19, 9, and, by, his, presence, at, the, wedding, in, cana, john, 2, 2, in, the, church, the, city, of, god, marriage, is, a, sacrament, and, may, not, and, cannot, be, dissolved, as, long, as, the, spouses, live, but, a, marriage, once, for, all, entered, upon, in, the, city, of, our, god, where, even, from, the, first, union, of, the, two, the, man, and, the, woman, marriage, bears, a, certain, sacramental, character, can, in, no, way, be, dissolved, but, by, the, death, of, one, of, them, in, chapter, 7, augustine, pointed, out, that, the, roman, empire, forbad, polygamy, even, if, the, reason, of, fertility, would, support, it, for, it, is, in, a, man, s, power, to, put, away, a, wife, that, is, barren, and, marry, one, of, whom, to, have, children, and, yet, it, is, not, allowed, and, now, indeed, in, our, times, and, after, the, usage, of, rome, nostris, quidem, iam, temporibus, ac, more, romano, neither, to, marry, in, addition, so, as, to, have, more, than, one, wife, living, further, on, he, notices, that, the, church, s, attitude, goes, much, further, than, the, secular, law, regarding, monogamy, it, forbids, remarrying, considering, such, to, be, a, form, of, fornication, and, yet, save, in, the, city, of, our, god, in, his, holy, mount, the, case, is, not, such, with, the, wife, but, that, the, laws, of, the, gentiles, are, otherwise, who, is, there, that, knows, not, the, council, of, trent, condemns, polygamy, if, anyone, saith, that, it, is, lawful, for, christians, to, have, several, wives, at, the, same, time, and, that, this, is, not, prohibited, by, any, divine, law, let, him, be, anathema, in, modern, times, a, minority, of, roman, catholic, theologians, have, argued, that, polygamy, though, not, ideal, can, be, a, legitimate, form, of, christian, marriage, in, certain, regions, in, particular, africa, the, roman, catholic, church, teaches, in, its, catechism, that, polygamy, is, not, in, accord, with, the, moral, law, communion, is, radically, contradicted, by, polygamy, this, in, fact, directly, negates, the, plan, of, god, that, was, revealed, from, the, beginning, because, it, is, contrary, to, the, equal, personal, dignity, of, men, and, women, who, in, matrimony, give, themselves, with, a, love, that, is, total, and, therefore, unique, and, exclusive, the, lutheran, world, federation, hosted, a, regional, conference, in, africa, in, which, the, acceptance, of, polygamists, into, full, membership, by, the, lutheran, church, in, liberia, was, defended, as, being, permissible, the, lutheran, church, in, liberia, however, does, not, permit, polygamists, who, have, become, christians, to, marry, more, wives, after, they, have, received, the, sacrament, of, holy, baptism, evangelical, lutheran, missionaries, in, maasai, also, tolerate, the, practice, of, polygamy, and, in, southern, sudan, some, polygamists, are, becoming, lutheran, christians, the, 1988, lambeth, conference, of, the, anglican, communion, ruled, that, polygamy, was, permissible, in, certain, circumstances, the, conference, upholds, monogamy, as, god, s, plan, as, the, idea, of, relationship, of, love, between, husband, and, wife, nevertheless, recommends, that, a, polygamist, who, responds, to, the, gospel, and, wishes, to, join, the, anglican, church, may, be, baptized, and, confirmed, with, his, believing, wives, and, children, on, the, following, conditions, in, accordance, with, what, joseph, smith, indicated, was, a, revelation, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, the, marriage, of, one, man, to, two, or, more, women, was, instituted, among, members, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, in, the, early, 1840s, despite, smith, s, revelation, the, 1835, edition, of, the, 101st, section, of, the, doctrine, and, covenants, written, after, the, doctrine, of, plural, marriage, began, to, be, practiced, publicly, condemned, polygamy, this, scripture, was, used, by, john, taylor, in, 1850, to, quash, mormon, polygamy, rumors, in, liverpool, england, polygamy, was, made, illegal, in, the, state, of, illinois, during, the, 1839, 44, nauvoo, era, when, several, top, mormon, leaders, including, smith, brigham, young, and, heber, c, kimball, took, multiple, wives, mormon, elders, who, publicly, taught, that, all, men, were, commanded, to, enter, plural, marriage, were, subject, to, harsh, discipline, on, 7, june, 1844, the, nauvoo, expositor, criticized, smith, for, plural, marriage, after, joseph, smith, was, killed, by, a, mob, on, 27, june, 1844, the, main, body, of, latter, day, saints, left, nauvoo, and, followed, brigham, young, to, utah, where, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, continued, in, 1852, brigham, young, the, second, president, of, the, lds, church, publicly, acknowledged, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, through, a, sermon, he, gave, additional, sermons, by, top, mormon, leaders, on, the, virtues, of, polygamy, followed, 128, controversy, followed, when, polygamy, became, a, social, cause, writers, began, to, publish, works, condemning, polygamy, the, key, plank, of, the, republican, party, s, 1856, platform, was, to, prohibit, in, the, territories, those, twin, relics, of, barbarism, polygamy, and, slavery, in, 1862, congress, issued, the, morrill, anti, bigamy, act, which, clarified, that, the, practice, of, polygamy, was, illegal, in, all, us, territories, the, lds, church, believed, that, their, religiously, based, practice, of, plural, marriage, was, protected, by, the, united, states, constitution, however, the, unanimous, 1878, supreme, court, decision, reynolds, v, united, states, declared, that, polygamy, was, not, protected, by, the, constitution, based, on, the, longstanding, legal, principle, that, laws, are, made, for, the, government, of, actions, and, while, they, cannot, interfere, with, mere, religious, belief, and, opinions, they, may, with, practices, increasingly, harsh, anti, polygamy, legislation, in, the, us, led, some, mormons, to, emigrate, to, canada, and, mexico, in, 1890, lds, church, president, wilford, woodruff, issued, a, public, declaration, the, manifesto, announcing, that, the, lds, church, had, discontinued, new, plural, marriages, anti, mormon, sentiment, waned, as, did, opposition, to, statehood, for, utah, the, smoot, hearings, in, 1904, which, documented, that, the, lds, church, was, still, practicing, polygamy, spurred, the, lds, church, to, issue, a, second, manifesto, again, claiming, that, it, had, ceased, performing, new, plural, marriages, by, 1910, the, lds, church, excommunicated, those, who, entered, into, or, performed, new, plural, marriages, even, so, many, plural, husbands, and, wives, continued, to, cohabit, until, their, deaths, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, enforcement, of, the, 1890, manifesto, caused, various, splinter, groups, to, leave, the, lds, church, in, order, to, continue, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, polygamy, among, these, groups, persists, today, in, utah, and, neighboring, states, as, well, as, in, the, spin, off, colonies, polygamist, churches, of, mormon, origin, are, often, referred, to, as, mormon, fundamentalist, churches, even, though, they, are, not, parts, of, the, lds, church, such, fundamentalists, often, use, a, purported, 1886, revelation, to, john, taylor, as, the, basis, for, their, authority, to, continue, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, the, salt, lake, tribune, stated, in, 2005, that, there, were, as, many, as, 37, 000, fundamentalists, with, less, than, half, of, them, living, in, polygamous, households, on, 13, december, 2013, us, federal, judge, clark, waddoups, ruled, in, brown, v, buhman, that, the, portions, of, utah, s, anti, polygamy, laws, which, prohibit, multiple, cohabitation, were, unconstitutional, but, also, allowed, utah, to, maintain, its, ban, on, multiple, marriage, licenses, unlawful, cohabitation, where, prosecutors, did, not, need, to, prove, that, a, marriage, ceremony, had, taken, place, only, that, a, couple, had, lived, together, had, been, the, primary, tool, used, to, prosecute, polygamy, in, utah, since, the, 1882, edmunds, act, the, council, of, friends, also, known, as, the, woolley, group, and, the, priesthood, council, was, one, of, the, original, expressions, of, mormon, fundamentalism, having, its, origins, in, the, teachings, of, lorin, c, woolley, a, dairy, farmer, excommunicated, from, the, lds, church, in, 1924, several, mormon, fundamentalist, groups, claim, lineage, through, the, council, of, friends, including, but, not, limited, to, the, fundamentalist, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, flds, church, the, apostolic, united, brethren, the, centennial, park, group, the, latter, day, church, of, christ, and, the, righteous, branch, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, community, of, christ, known, as, the, reorganized, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, rlds, church, prior, to, 2001, has, never, sanctioned, polygamy, since, its, foundation, in, 1860, joseph, smith, iii, the, first, prophet, president, of, the, rlds, church, following, the, reorganization, of, the, church, was, an, ardent, opponent, of, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, throughout, his, life, for, most, of, his, career, smith, denied, that, his, father, had, been, involved, in, the, practice, and, insisted, that, it, had, originated, with, brigham, young, smith, served, many, missions, to, the, western, united, states, where, he, met, with, and, interviewed, associates, and, women, claiming, to, be, widows, of, his, father, who, attempted, to, present, him, with, evidence, to, the, contrary, smith, typically, responded, to, such, accusations, by, saying, that, he, was, not, positive, nor, sure, that, was, innocent, and, that, if, indeed, the, elder, smith, had, been, involved, it, was, still, a, false, practice, however, many, members, of, the, community, of, christ, and, some, of, the, groups, that, were, previously, associated, with, it, are, not, convinced, that, joseph, smith, practiced, plural, marriage, and, they, believe, that, the, evidence, which, indicates, that, he, practiced, it, is, flawed, the, rigveda, mentions, that, during, the, vedic, period, a, man, could, have, more, than, one, wife, the, practice, is, attested, in, epics, like, the, ramayana, and, the, mahabharata, the, dharmashastra, s, permit, a, man, to, marry, women, provided, that, the, first, wife, agree, to, marry, him, despite, its, existence, it, was, most, usually, practiced, by, men, of, higher, status, common, people, were, only, allowed, a, second, marriage, if, the, first, wife, could, not, bear, a, son, or, have, some, dispute, because, there, is, no, law, for, divorce, in, hinduism, according, to, the, vishnu, smriti, the, number, of, wives, one, could, have, is, linked, to, one, s, social, class, referred, to, as, varna, now, a, br, hma, a, may, take, many, wives, in, the, direct, order, of, the, four, knowledge, a, kshatriya,

first, one, is, unable, to, discharge, her, religious, duties, or, is, unable, to, bear, a, child, or, have, any, dispute, because, in, hinduism, there, was, no, law, for, divorce, for, a, brahmana,

among, yourselves, so, that, you, may, find, comfort, in, them, and, he, has, placed, between, you, compassion, and, mercy, surely, in, this, are, signs, for, people, who, reflect, the, polygyny, that, is, allowed, in, the, quran, is, for, special, situations, there, are, strict, requirements, to, marrying, more, than, one, woman, as, the, man, must, treat, them, fairly, financially, and, in, terms, of, support, given, to, each, wife, according, to, islamic, law, however, islam, advises, monogamy, for, a, man, if, he, fears, he, cannot, deal, justly, with, his, wives, this, is, based, on, verse, 4, 3, of, quran, which, says, if, you, fear, you, might, fail, to, give, orphan, women, their, due, rights, if, you, were, to, marry, them, then, marry, other, women, of, your, choice, two, three, or, four, but, if, you, are, afraid, you, will, fail, to, maintain, justice, then, content, yourselves, with, one, or, those, bondwomen, in, your, possession, this, way, you, are, less, likely, to, commit, injustice, muslim, women, are, not, allowed, to, marry, more, than, one, husband, at, once, however, in, the, case, of, a, divorce, or, their, husbands, death, they, can, remarry, after, the, completion, of, iddah, as, divorce, is, legal, in, islamic, law, a, non, muslim, woman, who, flees, from, her, non, muslim, husband, and, accepts, islam, has, the, option, to, remarry, without, divorce, from, her, previous, husband, as, her, marriage, with, non, muslim, husband, is, islamically, dissolved, on, her, fleeing, a, non, muslim, woman, captured, during, war, by, muslims, can,

that, it, allows, a, man, to, give, financial, protection, to, multiple, women, who, might, otherwise, not, have, any, support, e, g, widows, however, some, islamic, scholars, say, the, wife, can, set, a, condition, in, the, marriage, contract, that, the, husband, cannot, marry, another, woman, during, their, marriage, in, such, a, case, the, husband, cannot, marry, another, woman, as, long,

wife, more, and, deuteronomy, 17, 17, states, that, the, king, shall, not, have, too, many, wives, despite, its, prevalence, in, the, hebrew, bible, some, scholars, do, not, believe, that, polygyny, was, commonly, practiced, in, the, biblical, era, because, it, required, a, significant, amount, of, wealth, michael, coogan, and, others, in, contrast, states, that, polygyny, continued, to, be, practiced, well, into, the, biblical, period, and, it, is, attested, among, jews, as, late, as, the, second, century, ce, the, dead, sea, scrolls, show, that, several, smaller, jewish, sects, forbade, polygamy, before, and, during, the, first, century, the, temple, scroll, 11qt, lvii, 17, 18, seems, to, prohibit, polygamy, the, rabbinical, era, beginning, with, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, saw, a, continuation, of, some, degree, of, legal, acceptance, for, polygamy, statements, in, the, talmud, include, be, thou, betrothed, to, half, of, me, she, is, betrothed, half, of, thee, be, betrothed, to, me, she, is, not, betrothed, and, elsewhere, a, man, may, marry, wives, in, addition, to, the, first, wife, provided, only, that, he, possesses, the, means, to, maintain, them, though, another, opinion, in, the, talmud, requires, divorcing, a, first, wife, before, taking, a, second, in, practice, polygamy, was, extremely, rare, in, jewish, society, in, the, talmudic, period, later, on, the, jewish, codices, began, a, process, of, restricting, polygamy, in, judaism, most, notable, though, more, specifically, for, ashkenazi, jews, was, the, synod, of, rabbeinu, gershom, about, 1000, ce, he, called, a, synod, which, decided, the, following, particulars, 1, prohibition, of, polygamy, 2, necessity, of, obtaining, the, consent, of, both, parties, to, a, divorce, 3, modification, of, the, rules, concerning, those, who, became, apostates, under, compulsion, 4, prohibition, against, opening, correspondence, addressed, to, another, some, sephardic, jews, such, as, abraham, david, taro, were, known, to, have, several, wives, polygamy, was, common, among, jewish, communities, in, the, levant, possibly, due, to, the, influence, of, muslim, society, with, 17, of, divorce, claims, by, women, being, due, to, complaints, over, husbands, taking, additional, wives, according, to, r, joseph, karo, 16th, century, author, of, the, last, great, codification, of, jewish, law, the, shulchan, aruch, and, many, other, rabbis, from, safed, the, ban, of, rabbeinu, gershom, had, expired, and, therefore, even, ashkenazim, could, marry, additional, wives, even, in, instances, where, the, husband, made, prenuptial, agreements, not, to, marry, additional, wives, local, rabbis, found, loopholes, to, allow, them, to, do, so, anyway, the, assembly, led, by, rabbeinu, gershom, instituted, a, ban, on, polygamy, but, this, ban, was, not, well, received, by, the, sephardic, communities, in, addition, to, the, ban, gershon, also, introduced, a, law, called, heter, meah, rabbanim, which, allows, the, men, to, remarry, with, the, permission, from, one, hundred, rabbis, from, different, countries, in, the, modern, day, polygamy, is, generally, not, condoned, by, jews, ashkenazi, jews, have, continued, to, follow, rabbenu, gershom, s, ban, since, the, 11th, century, some, mizrahi, jewish, communities, particularly, yemenite, jews, and, persian, jews, discontinued, polygyny, more, recently, after, they, immigrated, to, countries, where, it, was, forbidden, or, illegal, israel, prohibits, polygamy, by, law, in, practice, however, the, law, is, loosely, enforced, primarily, to, avoid, interference, with, bedouin, culture, where, polygyny, is, practiced, pre, existing, polygynous, unions, among, jews, from, arab, countries, or, other, countries, where, the, practice, was, not, prohibited, by, their, tradition, and, was, not, illegal, are, not, subject, to, this, israeli, law, but, mizrahi, jews, are, not, permitted, to, enter, into, new, polygamous, marriages, in, israel, however, polygamy, may, still, occur, in, non, european, jewish, communities, that, exist, in, countries, where, it, is, not, forbidden, such, as, jewish,

keeping, of, concubines, tzvi, zohar, a, professor, from, the, bar, ilan, university, recently, suggested, that, based, on, the, opinions, of, leading, halachic, authorities, the, concept, of, concubines, may, serve, as, a, practical, halachic, justification, for, premarital, or, non, marital, cohabitation, there, is, limited, information, about, polygamy, in, zoroastrian, tradition, there, is, no, passage, in, the, avesta, that, favors, polygamy, or, monogamy, however, tradition, holds, that, zoroaster, had, three, wives, polygamy, appears, to, have, been, a, right, of, spiritual,

all, might, desire, virtue, and, chastity, he, was, content, with, one, or, two, wives, for, himself, and, disapproved, of, having, many, children, saying, to, have, many, children, is, fitting, for, the, populace, but, kings, and, nobles, take, pride, in, the, smallness, of, their, families, it, was, also, written, about, in, the, 4th, century, ce, by, the, roman, soldier, and, historian, ammianus, marcellinus, writing, about, zoroastrian, communities, each, man, according, to, his, means, contracts, many, or, few, marriages, whence, their, affection, divided, as, it, is, among,

women, and, should, be, outlawed, specifically, reports, to, un, committees, have, noted, violations, of, iccpr, due, to, these, inequalities, and, reports, to, the, un, general, assembly, have,
