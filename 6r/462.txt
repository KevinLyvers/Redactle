ski, jumping, is, a, winter, sport, in, which, competitors, aim, to, achieve, the, farthest, jump, after, sliding, down, on, their, skis, from, a, specially, designed, curved, ramp, along, with, jump, length, competitor, s, aerial, style, and, other, factors, also, affect, the, final, score, ski, jumping, was, first, contested, in, norway, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, later, spread, through, europe, and, north, america, in, the, early, 20th, century, along, with, cross, country, skiing, it, constitutes, the, traditional, group, of, nordic, skiing, disciplines, the, ski, jumping, venue, commonly, referred, to, as, a, hill, consists, of, the, jumping, ramp, in, run, take, off, table, and, a, landing, hill, each, jump, is, evaluated, according, to, the, distance, covered, and, the, style, performed, the, distance, score, is, related, to, the, construction, point, also, known, as, the, k, point, which, is, a, line, drawn, in, the, landing, area, and, serves, as, a, target, for, the, competitors, to, reach, the, score, of, each, judge, evaluating, the, style, can, reach, a, maximum, of, 20, points, the, jumping, technique, has, evolved, over, the, years, from, jumps, with, the, skis, parallel, and, both, arms, extended, forward, to, the, v, style, which, is, widely, used, today, ski, jumping, has, been, included, at, the, winter, olympics, since, 1924, and, at, the, fis, nordic, world, ski, championships, since, 1925, women, s, participation, in, the, sport, began, in, the, 1990s, while, the, first, women, s, event, at, the, olympics, has, been, held, in, 2014, all, major, ski, jumping, competitions, are, organised, by, the, international, ski, federation, stefan, kraft, holds, the, official, record, for, the, world, s, longest, ski, jump, with, 253, 5, metres, 832, ft, set, on, the, ski, flying, hill, in, vikersund, in, 2017, ski, jumping, can, also, be, performed, in, the, summer, on, an, in, run, where, the, tracks, are, made, from, porcelain, and, the, grass, on, the, slope, is, covered, with, water, soaked, plastic, the, highest, level, summer, competition, is, the, fis, ski, jumping, grand, prix, contested, since, 1994, like, most, of, the, nordic, skiing, disciplines, the, first, ski, jumping, competitions, were, held, in, norway, in, the, 19th, century, although, there, is, evidence, of, ski, jumping, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, recorded, origins, of, the, first, ski, jump, trace, back, to, 1808, when, olaf, rye, reached, 9, 5, m, 31, ft, sondre, norheim, who, is, regarded, as, the, father, of, the, modern, ski, jumping, won, the, first, ever, ski, jumping, competition, with, prizes, which, was, held, in, h, ydalsmo, in, 1866, the, first, larger, ski, jumping, competition, was, held, on, husebyrennet, hill, in, oslo, norway, in, 1875, due, to, its, poor, infrastructure, and, the, weather, conditions, in, 1892, the, event, was, moved, to, holmenkollen, which, is, today, still, one, of, the, main, ski, jumping, events, in, the, season, in, the, late, 19th, century, sondre, norheim, and, nordic, skier, karl, hovelsen, immigrated, to, the, united, states, and, started, developing, the, sport, in, that, country, in, 1924, ski, jumping, was, featured, at, the, 1924, winter, olympics, in, chamonix, france, the, sport, has, been, featured, at, every, olympics, since, ski, jumping, was, brought, to, canada, by, norwegian, immigrant, nels, nelsen, starting, with, his, example, in, 1915, until, late, 1959, annual, ski, jumping, competitions, were, held, on, mount, revelstoke, the, ski, hill, nelsen, designed, the, longest, period, of, any, canadian, ski, jumping, venue, revelstoke, s, was, the, biggest, natural, ski, jump, hill, in, canada, and, internationally, recognized, as, one, of, the, best, in, north, america, the, length, and, natural, grade, of, its, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, hill, made, possible, jumps, of, over, 60, m, 200, ft, the, longest, in, canada, it, was, also, the, only, hill, in, canada, where, world, ski, jumping, records, were, set, in, 1916, 1921, 1925, 1932, and, 1933, in, 1935, the, origins, of, ski, flying, began, in, planica, slovenia, where, josef, bradl, became, the, first, competitor, in, history, to, jump, over, 100, m, 330, ft, at, the, same, venue, the, first, official, jump, over, 200, m, 660, ft, was, achieved, in, 1994, when, toni, nieminen, landed, at, 203, meters, in, 1964, in, zakopane, poland, the, large, hill, event, was, introduced, at, the, fis, nordic, world, ski, championships, in, the, same, year, the, normal, hill, event, was, included, on, the, olympic, programme, at, the, 1964, winter, olympics, the, team, event, was, added, later, at, the, 1988, winter, olympics, a, ski, jumping, hill, is, typically, built, on, a, steep, natural, slope, it, consists, of, the, jumping, ramp, in, run, take, off, table, and, a, landing, hill, competitors, glide, down, from, a, common, point, at, the, top, of, the, in, run, achieving, considerable, speeds, at, the, take, off, table, where, they, take, off, carried, by, their, own, momentum, while, airborne, they, maintain, an, aerodynamic, position, with, their, bodies, and, skis, which, allows, them, to, maximise, the, length, of, their, jump, the, landing, slope, is, constructed, so, that, the, jumper, s, trajectory, is, near, parallel, with, it, and, the, athlete, s, relative, height, to, the, ground, is, gradually, lost, allowing, for, a, gentle, and, safe, landing, the, landing, space, is, followed, by, an, out, run, a, substantial, flat, or, counter, inclined, area, that, permits, the, skier, to, safely, slow, down, the, out, run, area, is, fenced, and, surrounded, by, a, public, auditorium, the, slopes, are, classified, according, to, the, distance, that, the, competitors, travel, in, the, air, between, the, end, of, the, table, and, the, landing, each, hill, has, a, construction, point, k, point, which, serves, as, a, target, that, the, competitors, should, reach, the, classification, of, the, hills, are, as, follows, competitors, are, ranked, according, to, a, numerical, score, obtained, by, adding, up, components, based, on, distance, style, inrun, length, gate, factor, and, wind, conditions, in, the, individual, event, the, scores, from, each, skier, s, two, competition, jumps, are, combined, to, determine, the, winner, distance, score, depends, on, the, hill, s, k, point, for, k, 90, and, k, 120, competitions, the, k, point, is, set, at, 90, meters, and, 120, meters, respectively, competitors, are, awarded, 60, points, normal, and, large, hills, and, 120, points, flying, hills, if, they, land, on, the, k, point, for, every, meter, beyond, or, below, the, k, point, extra, points, are, awarded, or, deducted, the, typical, value, is, 2, points, per, meter, in, small, hills, 1, 8, points, in, large, hills, and, 1, 2, points, in, ski, flying, hills, a, competitor, s, distance, is, measured, between, the, takeoff, and, the, point, where, the, feet, came, in, full, contact, with, the, landing, slope, for, abnormal, landings, touchpoint, of, one, foot, or, another, body, part, is, considered, jumps, are, measured, with, accuracy, of, 0, 5, meters, for, all, competitions, 64, 65, during, the, competition, five, judges, are, based, in, a, tower, to, the, side, of, the, expected, landing, point, they, can, award, up, to, 20, points, each, for, jumping, style, based, on, keeping, the, skis, steady, during, flight, balance, optimal, body, position, and, landing, the, highest, and, lowest, style, scores, are, disregarded, with, the, remaining, three, scores, added, to, the, distance, score, gate, and, wind, factors, were, introduced, by, the, 2009, rules, to, allow, fairer, comparison, of, results, for, a, scoring, compensation, for, variable, outdoor, conditions, aerodynamics, and, take, off, speed, are, important, variables, that, affect, the, jump, length, and, if, weather, conditions, change, during, a, competition, the, conditions, will, not, be, the, same, for, all, competitors, gate, factor, is, an, adjustment, made, when, the, inrun, or, start, gate, length, is, adjusted, from, the, initial, position, in, order, to, provide, optimal, take, off, speed, since, higher, gates, result, in, higher, take, off, speeds, and, therefore, present, an, advantage, to, competitors, points, are, subtracted, when, the, starting, gate, is, moved, up, and, added, when, the, gate, is, lowered, an, advanced, calculation, also, determines, compensation, points, for, the, actual, unequal, wind, conditions, at, the, time, of, the, jump, when, there, is, back, wind, points, are, added, and, when, there, is, front, wind, points, are, subtracted, wind, speed, and, direction, are, measured, at, five, different, points, based, on, average, value, which, is, determined, before, every, competition, if, two, or, more, competitors, finish, the, competition, with, the, same, number, of, points, they, are, given, the, same, placing, and, receive, same, prizes, ski, jumpers, below, the, minimum, safe, body, mass, index, are, penalised, with, a, shorter, maximum, ski, length, reducing, the, aerodynamic, lift, they, can, achieve, these, rules, have, been, credited, with, stopping, the, most, severe, cases, of, underweight, athletes, but, some, competitors, still, lose, weight, to, maximise, the, distance, they, can, achieve, in, order, to, prevent, an, unfair, advantage, due, to, a, sailing, effect, of, the, ski, jumping, suit, material, thickness, and, relative, size, of, the, suit, are, regulated, each, jump, is, divided, into, four, parts, in, run, take, off, jump, flight, and, landing, by, using, the, v, style, firstly, pioneered, by, swedish, ski, jumper, jan, bokl, v, in, the, mid, 1980s, modern, skiers, are, able, to, exceed, the, distance, of, the, take, off, hill, by, about, 10, compared, to, the, previous, technique, with, parallel, skis, previous, techniques, included, the, kongsberger, technique, the, d, escher, technique, and, the, windisch, technique, until, the, mid, 1960s, the, ski, jumper, came, down, the, in, run, of, the, hill, with, both, arms, pointing, forwards, this, changed, when, the, d, scher, technique, was, pioneered, by, andreas, d, scher, in, the, 1950s, as, a, modification, of, the, kongsberger, and, windisch, techniques, a, lesser, used, technique, as, of, 2017, is, the, h, style, which, is, essentially, a, combination, of, the, parallel, and, v, styles, in, which, the, skis, are, spread, very, wide, apart, and, held, parallel, in, an, h, shape, it, is, prominently, used, by, domen, prevc, skiers, are, required, to, touch, the, ground, in, the, telemark, landing, style, norwegian, telemarksnedslag, named, after, the, norwegian, county, of, telemark, this, involves, the, landing, with, one, foot, in, front, of, the, other, with, knees, slightly, bent, mimicking, the, style, of, telemark, skiing, failure, to, execute, a, telemark, landing, leads, to, the, deduction, of, style, points, issued, by, the, judges, all, major, ski, jumping, competitions, are, organised, by, the, international, ski, federation, the, large, hill, ski, jumping, event, was, included, at, the, winter, olympic, games, for, the, first, time, in, 1924, and, has, been, contested, at, every, winter, olympics, since, then, the, normal, hill, event, was, added, in, 1964, since, 1992, the, normal, hill, event, is, contested, at, the, k, 90, size, hill, previously, it, was, contested, at, the, k, 60, hill, women, s, debuted,

25, 30, competitions, at, most, prestigious, hills, across, europe, united, states, and, japan, competitors, are, awarded, a, fixed, number, of, points, in, each, event, according, to, their, ranking, and, the, overall, winner, is, the, one, with, most, accumulated, points, fis, ski, flying, world, cup, is, contested, as, a, sub, event, of, the, world, cup, and, competitors, collect, only, the,
