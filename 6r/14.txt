was, largely, promoted, by, his, son, and, successor, louis, xiv, of, france, 1638, 1715, which, contributed, to, its, spread, in, europe, and, european, influenced, countries, in, the, 1660s, wig,

was, uneasy, about, wearing, it, 3rd, september, 1665, up, and, put, on, my, coloured, silk, suit, very, fine, and, my, new, periwig, bought, a, good, while, since, but, darst, not, wear, it, because, the, plague, was, in, westminster, when, i, bought, it, and, it, is, a, wonder, what, will, be, the, fashion, after, the, plague, is, done, as, to, periwigs, for, nobody, will, dare, to, buy, any, haire, for, fear, of, the, infection, that, it, had, been, cut, off, the, heads, of, people, dead, of, the, plague, wigs, were, not, without, other, drawbacks, as, pepys, noted, on, march, 27, 1663, i, did, go, to, the, swan, and, there, sent, for, jervas, my, old, periwig, maker, and, he, did, bring, me, a, periwig, but, it, was, full, of, nits, so, as, i, was, troubled, to, see, it, it, being, his, old, fault, and, did, send, him, to, make, it, clean, with, wigs, virtually, obligatory, garb, for, men, with, social, rank, wigmakers, gained, considerable, prestige, a, wigmakers, guild, was, established, in, france, in, 1665, a, development, soon, copied, elsewhere, in, europe, their, job, was, a, skilled, one, as, 17th, century, wigs, were, extraordinarily, elaborate, covering, the, back, and, shoulders, and, flowing, down, the, chest, not, surprisingly, they, were, also, extremely, heavy, and, often, uncomfortable, to, wear, such, wigs, were, expensive, to, produce, the, best, examples, were, made, from, natural, human, hair, the, hair, of, horses, and, goats, was, often, used, as, a, cheaper, alternative, several, contemporary, writings, which, have, survived, noted, that, some, viewed, men, who, wore, wigs, as, looking, deformed, and, emasculated, it, especially, attracted, disapproval, from, puritans, and, during, times, of, plague, it, was, said, that, wigs, were, made, of, hair, of, plague, victims, wigs, required, cleaning, using, fuller, s, earth, and, the, powder, used, to, freshen, it, was, made, from, low, grade, flour, and, scented, with, pomatum, in, the, 18th, century, men, s, wigs, were, powdered, to, give, them, their, distinctive, white, or, off, white, color, women, in, the, 18th, century, did, not, wear, wigs, but, wore, a, coiffure, supplemented, by, artificial, hair, or, hair, from, other, sources, powdered, wigs, men, and, powdered, natural, hair, with, supplemental, hairpieces, women, became, essential, for, full, dress, occasions, and, continued, in, use, until, almost, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, elaborate, form, of, wigs, worn, at, the, coronation, of, george, iii, in, 1761, was, lampooned, by, william, hogarth, in, his, engraving, five, orders, of, periwigs, powdering, wigs, and, extensions, was, messy, and, inconvenient, and, the, development, of, the, naturally, white, or, off, white, powderless, wig, made, of, horsehair, for, men, made, the, retention, of, wigs, in, everyday, court, dress, a, practical, possibility, by, 1765, wig, wearing, went, out, of, fashion, except, for, some, occupational, groups, such, as, coachmen, and, lawyers, during, this, period, people, tended, to, simply, wear, their, natural, hair, styled, and, powdered, to, resemble, a, wig, however, the, trend, revived, extravagantly, during, the, macaroni, period, of, the, 1770s, women, mainly, powdered, their, hair, grey, or, blue, ish, grey, and, from, the, 1770s, onwards, never, bright, white, like, men, wig, powder, was, made, from, finely, ground, starch, that, was, scented, with, orange, flower, lavender, or, orris, root, wig, powder, was, occasionally, colored, violet, blue, pink, or, yellow, but, was, most, often, off, white, by, the, 1780s, young, men, were, setting, a, fashion, trend, by, lightly, powdering, their, natural, hair, as, women, had, already, done, from, the, 1770s, onwards, after, 1790, both, wigs, and, powder, were, reserved, for, older, more, conservative, men, and, were, in, use, by, ladies, being, presented, at, court, after, 1790, english, women, seldom, powdered, their, hair, in, 1795, the, british, government, levied, a, tax, on, hair, powder, of, one, guinea, per, year, this, tax, effectively, caused, the, demise, of, both, the, fashion, for, wigs, and, powder, granville, leveson, gower, in, paris, during, the, winter, of, 1796, at, the, height, of, the, thermidorian, directory, noted, the, word, citoyen, seemed, but, very, little, in, use, and, hair, powder, being, very, common, the, appearance, of, the, people, was, less, democratic, than, in, england, among, women, in, the, french, court, of, versailles, in, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, large, elaborate, and, often, themed, wigs, such, as, the, stereotypical, boat, poufs, were, in, vogue, these, combed, up, hair, extensions, were, often, very, heavy, weighted, down, with, pomades, powders, and, other, ornamentation, in, the, late, 18th, century, these, coiffures, along, with, many, other, indulgences, in, court, life, became, symbolic, of, the, decadence, of, the, french, nobility, and, for, that, reason, quickly, became, out, of, fashion, from, the, beginning, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, during, the, 18th, century, men, s, wigs, became, smaller, and, more, formal, with, several, professions, adopting, them, as, part, of, their, official, costumes, this, tradition, survives, in, a, few, legal, systems, they, are, routinely, worn, in, various, countries, of, the, commonwealth, until, 1823, bishops, of, the, church, of, england, and, church, of, ireland, wore, ceremonial, wigs, the, wigs, worn, by, barristers, are, in, the, style, favoured, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, judges, wigs, in, everyday, use, as, court, dress, are, short, like, barristers, wigs, although, in, a, slightly, different, style, but, for, ceremonial, occasions, judges, and, also, senior, barristers, kcs, wear, full, bottomed, wigs, in, the, 18th, century, wigmaking, was, a, craft, guild, in, multiple, cities, the, guilds, government, and, others, were, constantly, concerned, about, quality, the, lyon, wigmaker, guild, petitioned, local, magistrates, to, uphold, statutes, banning, bleached, human, hair, as, well, as, wild, goat, and, lamb, hair, the, guild, officers, claimed, that, the, process, of, bleaching, damaged, the, hair, too, much, thereby, forcing, a, wigmaker, to, sell, a, faulty, product, to, consumers, as, for, the, wild, goat, and, lamb, hair, they, claimed, it, was, too, coarse, to, style, 18th, century, french, wigmakers, used, an, interesting, technique, to, ensure, that, the, hair, retained, moisture, baking, hair, into, dough, in, paris, gingerbread, bakers, would, routinely, bake, hair, dough, for, wigmakers, although, in, other, french, cities, it, was, not, necessarily, gingerbread, taxes, on, hair, dough, baking, were, proposed, in, 1705, in, grenoble, wigmakers, complained, that, such, tax, obligations, destroy, the, liberty, of, commerce, because, no, baker, is, obliged, to, bake, wigmakers, hair, dough, instead, doing, it, for, them, as, a, courtesy, due, to, the, association, with, ruling, classes, in, european, monarchies, the, wearing, of, wigs, as, a, symbol, of, social, status, was, largely, abandoned, in, the, newly, created, republics, the, united, states, and, france, by, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, though, formal, court, dress, of, european, monarchies, still, required, a, powdered, wig, or, long, powdered, hair, tied, in, a, queue, until, the, accession, of, napoleon, bonaparte, 1769, 1821, to, the, throne, as, emperor, in, 1804, in, the, united, states, only, four, presidents, from, john, adams, 1735, 1826, to, james, monroe, 1758, 1831, wore, curly, powdered, wigs, tied, in, a, queue, according, to, the, old, fashioned, style, of, the, 18th, century, though, thomas, jefferson, 1743, 1826, wore, a, powdered, wig, only, rarely, and, stopped, wearing, a, wig, entirely, shortly, after, becoming, president, in, 1801, john, quincy, adams, 1767, 1848, also, wore, a, powdered, wig, in, his, youth, but, he, abandoned, this, fashion, while, serving, as, the, u, s, minister, to, russia, 1809, 1814, long, before, his, accession, to, the, presidency, in, 1825, unlike, them, the, first, president, george, washington, 1732, 1799, never, wore, a, wig, instead, he, powdered, curled, and, tied, in, a, queue, his, own, long, hair, women, s, wigs, developed, in, a, somewhat, different, way, they, were, worn, from, the, 18th, century, onwards, although, at, first, only, surreptitiously, full, wigs, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, were, not,

business, supplying, postiches, or, pre, made, small, wiglets, curls, and, false, buns, to, be, incorporated, into, the, hairstyle, the, use, of, postiches, did, not, diminish, even, as, women, s,

that, uniform, officers, wore, wigs, more, suited, to, the, drawing, rooms, of, europe, than, its, battlefields, the, late, 17th, century, saw, officers, wearing, full, bottomed, natural, coloured,

long, and, according, to, the, prevailing, fashion, in, a, nation, s, army, hair, was, either, allowed, to, grow, long, with, simple, modeling, as, in, the, french, army, of, the, 1740s, or, else, was, elaborately, coiffured, as, in, prussian, and, british, armies, in, the, case, of, british, soldiers, of, the, 1740s, contemporary, artwork, suggests, that, they, cut, their, hair, short, which, was, not, the, case, instead, the, men, used, tallow, or, other, fat, to, grease, the, hair, which, was, then, fashioned, into, pigtails, and, tied, back, into, the, scalp, hair, to, give, the, impression, of, short, hair, it, was, then, liberally, dusted, with, powdered, chalk, to, give, the, impression, of, a, powdered, wig, later, in, the, century, hair, was, likewise, tied, back, greased, and, powdered, but, false, hair, pigtails, were, adopted, kept, in, a, tubular, queue, and, tied, back, with, ribbons, to, the, soldier, s, own, hair, the, overall, effect, was, that, of, a, wig, with, a, long, tail, and, bow, the, prussian, army, took, personal, hairstyles, to, an, extreme, during, the, time, of, frederick, the, great, each, soldier, commonly, having, a, long, pigtail, hanging, down, the, back, nearly, to, waist, level, by, contrast, in, the, 1780s, russian, general, potemkin, abhorred, the, tight, uniforms, and, uncomfortable, wigs, and, powdered, coiffures, worn,

standard, part, of, the, military, uniform, until, 1801, in, 1801, james, wilkinson, a, senior, officer, of, the, u, s, army, issued, an, order, to, remove, all, queues, or, pigtails, which, had, been, worn, in, the, army, since, the, revolutionary, war, 1775, 1783, this, order, applied, also, to, powdered, wigs, tied, in, queue, and, was, highly, unpopular, with, both, officers, and, men, leading, to, several, desertions, and, threats, of, resignation, jewish, law, requires, married, women, to, cover, their, hair, for, reasons, of, tzniut, hebrew, modesty, or, privacy, some, orthodox, jewish, women, wear, wigs, known, as, sheitels, for, this, purpose, wigs, of, those, who, practice, haredi, judaism, and, hasidic, judaism, often, are, made, from, human, hair, in, modern, orthodox, judaism, women, will, usually, wear, a, scarf, kerchief, snood, hat, or, other, covering, sometimes, exposing, the, bottom, of, their, hair, one, rabbi, has, declared, that, long, wigs, are, inappropriate, another, said, that, it, is, preferable, for, a, married, jewish, woman, to, expose, her, hair, than, to, don, a, wig, for, the, wig, actually, increases, attraction, in, the, public, domain, and, encourages, the, notion, that, halakha, is, both, irrational, and, intellectually, dishonest, still, another, rabbi, who, also, spoke, strongly, against, the, wearing, of, wigs, said, specifically, you, must, go, with, a, hat, or, kerchief, on, your, head, but, did, not, permit, leaving, hair, exposed, most, orthodox, women, cover, their, hair, whether, with, wigs, hats, or, scarves, the, rejection, by, some, rabbis, of, wigs, is, not, recent, but, began, in, the, 1600s, when, french, women, began, wearing, wigs, to, cover, their, hair, rabbis, rejected, this, practice, both, because, it, resembled, the, contemporary, non, jewish, style, and, because, it, was, immodest, in, their, eyes, for, a, woman, to, sport, a, beautiful, head, of, hair, even, if, it, was, a, wig, other, options, include, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, wigmakers, were, called, perruquiers, there, are, two, methods, of, attaching, hair, to, wigs, the, first, and, oldest, is, to, weave, the, root, ends, of, the, hair, onto, a, stretch, of, three, silk, threads, to, form, a, sort, of, fringe, called, a, weft, the, wefts, are, then, sewn, to, a, foundation, made, of, net, or, other, material, in, modern, times, the, wefts, can, also, be, made, a, warp, is, the, vertical, thread, of, a, weave, the, weft, is, the, horizontal, thread, with, a, specially, adapted, sewing, machine, reducing, the, amount, of, hand, labour, involved, in, the, 19th, century, another, method, came, into, use, a, small, hook, called, a, ventilating, needle, or, knotting, needle, similar, to, the, tambour, hooks, used, for, decorating, fabric, with, chain, stitch, embroidery, at, that, period, is, used, to, knot, a, few, strands, of, hair, at, a, time, directly, to, a, suitable, foundation, material, this, newer, method, produces, a, lighter, and, more, natural, looking, wig, high, quality, custom, wigs, and, those, used, for, film, and, theatrical, productions, are, usually, done, this, way, it, is, also, possible, to, combine, the, two, techniques, using, weft, for, the, main, part, of, the, wig, and, ventilating, hair, at, the, edges, and, partings, to, give, a, fine, finish, making, custom, wigs, starts, with, measuring, the, subject, s, head, the, natural, hair, is, arranged, in, flat, curls, against, the, head, as, the, various, measurements, are, taken, it, is, often, helpful, to, make, a, pattern, from, layers, of, transparent, adhesive, tape, applied, over, a, piece, of, plastic, wrap, on, which, the, natural, hairline, can, be, traced, accurately, these, measurements, are, then, transferred, to, the, block, a, wooden, or, cork, stuffed, canvas, form, the, same, size, and, shape, as, the, client, s, head, depending, on, the, style, of, the, wig, a,
