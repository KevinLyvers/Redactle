sake, sak, sake, s, k, i, s, k, e, sah, kee, sak, ay, or, saki, also, referred, to, as, japanese, rice, wine, is, an, alcoholic, beverage, of, japanese, origin, made, by, fermenting, rice, that, has, been, polished, to, remove, the, bran, despite, the, name, japanese, rice, wine, sake, and, indeed, any, east, asian, rice, wine, such, as, huangjiu, and, cheongju, is, produced, by, a, brewing, process, more, akin, to, that, of, beer, where, starch, is, converted, into, sugars, that, ferment, into, alcohol, whereas, in, wine, alcohol, is, produced, by, fermenting, sugar, that, is, naturally, present, in, fruit, typically, grapes, the, brewing, process, for, sake, differs, from, the, process, for, beer, where, the, conversion, from, starch, to, sugar, and, then, from, sugar, to, alcohol, occurs, in, two, distinct, steps, like, other, rice, wines, when, sake, is, brewed, these, conversions, occur, simultaneously, the, alcohol, content, differs, between, sake, wine, and, beer, while, most, beer, contains, 3, 9, abv, wine, generally, contains, 9, 16, abv, and, undiluted, sake, contains, 18, 20, abv, although, this, is, often, lowered, to, about, 15, by, diluting, with, water, before, bottling, in, japanese, the, character, sake, kanji, japanese, pronunciation, can, refer, to, any, alcoholic, drink, while, the, beverage, called, sake, in, english, is, usually, termed, nihonshu, meaning, japanese, alcoholic, drink, under, japanese, liquor, laws, sake, is, labeled, with, the, word, seishu, refined, alcohol, a, synonym, not, commonly, used, in, conversation, in, japan, where, it, is, the, national, beverage, sake, is, often, served, with, special, ceremony, where, it, is, gently, warmed, in, a, small, earthenware, or, porcelain, bottle, and, sipped, from, a, small, porcelain, cup, called, a, sakazuki, as, with, wine, the, recommended, serving, temperature, of, sake, varies, greatly, by, type, sake, now, enjoys, an, international, reputation, of, the, more, than, 800, junmai, ginj, shu, evaluated, by, robert, parker, s, team, 78, received, a, score, of, 90, or, more, erobertparker, 2016, the, origin, of, sake, is, unclear, however, the, method, of, fermenting, rice, into, alcohol, spread, to, japan, from, china, around, 500bce, the, earliest, reference, to, the, use, of, alcohol, in, japan, is, recorded, in, the, book, of, wei, in, the, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, this, 3rd, century, chinese, text, speaks, of, japanese, drinking, and, dancing, alcoholic, beverages, sake, are, mentioned, several, times, in, the, kojiki, japan, s, first, written, history, which, was, compiled, in, 712, bamforth, 2005, places, the, probable, origin, of, true, sake, which, is, made, from, rice, water, and, koji, aspergillus, oryzae, in, the, nara, period, 710, 794, the, fermented, food, fungi, traditionally, used, for, making, alcoholic, beverages, in, china, and, korea, for, a, long, time, were, fungi, belonging, to, rhizopus, and, mucor, whereas, in, japan, except, in, the, early, days, the, fermented, food, fungus, used, for, sake, brewing, was, aspergillus, oryzae, some, scholars, believe, the, japanese, domesticated, the, mutated, detoxified, aspergillus, flavus, to, give, rise, to, aspergillus, oryzae, in, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, sake, was, used, for, religious, ceremonies, court, festivals, and, drinking, games, sake, production, was, a, government, monopoly, for, a, long, time, but, in, the, 10th, century, buddhist, temples, and, shinto, shrines, began, to, brew, sake, and, they, became, the, main, centers, of, production, for, the, next, 500, years, before, the, 1440s, in, the, muromachi, period, 1333, 1573, the, buddhist, temple, sh, ryaku, ji, invented, various, innovative, methods, for, making, sake, because, these, production, methods, are, the, origin, of, the, basic, production, methods, for, sake, brewing, today, shoryakuji, is, often, said, to, be, the, birthplace, of, seishu, until, then, most, sake, had, been, nigorizake, with, a, different, process, from, today, s, but, after, that, clear, seishu, was, established, the, main, production, methods, established, by, sh, ryaku, ji, are, the, use, of, all, polished, rice, morohaku, zukuri, three, stage, fermentation, sandan, zikomi, brewing, of, starter, mash, using, acidic, water, produced, by, lactic, acid, fermentation, bodaimoto, zukuri, and, pasteurization, hiire, this, method, of, producing, starter, mash, is, called, bodaimoto, which, is, the, origin, of, kimoto, these, innovations, made, it, possible, to, produce, sake, with, more, stable, quality, than, before, even, in, temperate, regions, these, things, are, described, in, goshu, no, nikki, ja, the, oldest, known, technical, book, on, sake, brewing, written, in, 1355, or, 1489, and, tamonin, nikki, ja, a, diary, written, between, 1478, and, 1618, by, monks, of, k, fuku, ji, temple, in, the, muromachi, period, a, huge, tub, ja, with, a, capacity, of, 10, koku, 1, 800, liters, was, invented, at, the, end, of, the, muromachi, period, making, it, possible, to, mass, produce, sake, more, efficiently, than, before, until, then, sake, had, been, made, in, jars, with, a, capacity, of, 1, 2, or, 3, koku, at, the, most, and, some, sake, brewers, used, to, make, sake, by, arranging, 100, jars, in, the, 16th, century, the, technique, of, distillation, was, introduced, into, the, kyushu, district, from, ryukyu, the, brewing, of, sh, ch, called, imo, sake, started, and, was, sold, at, the, central, market, in, kyoto, by, the, genroku, era, 1688, 1704, of, the, edo, period, 1603, 1867, a, brewing, method, called, hashira, j, ch, was, developed, in, which, a, small, amount, of, distilled, alcohol, sh, ch, was, added, to, the, mash, to, make, it, more, aromatic, and, lighter, in, taste, while, at, the, same, preventing, deterioration, in, quality, this, originates, from, the, distilled, alcohol, addition, used, in, modern, sake, brewing, the, nada, gog, area, in, hy, go, prefecture, the, largest, producer, of, modern, sake, was, formed, during, this, period, when, the, population, of, edo, modern, day, tokyo, began, to, grow, rapidly, in, the, early, 1600s, brewers, who, made, sake, in, inland, areas, such, as, fushimi, itami, and, ikeda, moved, to, the, nada, gog, area, on, the, coast, where, the, weather, and, water, quality, were, perfect, for, brewing, sake, and, convenient, for, shipping, it, to, edo, in, the, genroku, era, when, the, culture, of, the, ch, nin, class, the, common, people, prospered, the, consumption, of, sake, increased, rapidly, and, large, quantities, of, taruzake, were, shipped, to, edo, 80, of, the, sake, drunk, in, edo, during, this, period, was, from, nada, gog, many, of, today, s, major, sake, producers, including, hakutsuru, ja, zeki, ja, nihonsakari, ja, kikumasamune, ja, kenbishi, ja, and, sawanotsuru, are, breweries, in, nada, gog, during, this, period, frequent, natural, disasters, and, bad, weather, caused, rice, shortages, and, the, tokugawa, shogunate, issued, sake, brewing, restrictions, 61, times, in, the, early, edo, period, there, was, a, sake, brewing, technique, called, shiki, j, z, that, was, optimized, for, each, season, in, 1667, the, technique, of, kanzukuri, for, making, sake, in, winter, was, improved, and, in, 1673, when, the, tokugawa, shogunate, banned, brewing, other, than, kanzukuri, because, of, a, shortage, of, rice, the, technique, of, sake, brewing, in, the, four, seasons, ceased, and, it, became, common, to, make, sake, only, in, winter, until, industrial, technology, began, to, develop, in, the, 20th, century, during, this, period, aged, for, three, five, or, nine, years, koshu, was, a, luxury, but, its, deliciousness, was, known, to, the, common, people, in, the, 18th, century, engelbert, kaempfer, and, isaac, titsingh, published, accounts, identifying, sake, as, a, popular, alcoholic, beverage, in, japan, but, titsingh, was, the, first, to, try, to, explain, and, describe, the, process, of, sake, brewing, the, work, of, both, writers, was, widely, disseminated, throughout, europe, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, starting, around, the, beginning, of, the, meiji, era, 1868, 1912, the, technique, for, making, sake, began, to, develop, rapidly, breeding, was, actively, carried, out, in, various, parts, of, japan, to, produce, sake, rice, optimized, for, sake, brewing, ise, nishiki, developed, in, 1860, omachi, ja, developed, in, 1866, and, shinriki, developed, in, 1877, are, the, earliest, representative, varieties, in, 1923, yamada, nishiki, later, called, the, king, of, sake, rice, was, produced, among, more, than, 123, varieties, of, sake, rice, as, of, 2019, yamada, nishiki, ranks, first, in, production, and, omachi, fourth, the, government, opened, the, sake, brewing, research, institute, in, 1904, and, in, 1907, the, first, government, run, sake, tasting, competition, was, held, in, 1904, the, national, brewing, laboratory, developed, yamahai, a, new, method, of, making, starter, mash, and, in, 1910, a, further, improvement, sokuj, was, developed, yeast, strains, specifically, selected, for, their, brewing, properties, were, isolated, and, enamel, coated, steel, tanks, arrived, the, government, started, hailing, the, use, of, enamel, tanks, as, easy, to, clean, lasting, forever, and, devoid, of, bacterial, problems, the, government, considered, wooden, tubs, ja, to, be, unhygienic, because, of, the, potential, bacteria, living, in, the, wood, although, these, things, are, true, the, government, also, wanted, more, tax, money, from, breweries, as, using, wooden, tubs, means, a, significant, amount, of, sake, is, lost, to, evaporation, approximately, 3, which, could, have, otherwise, been, taxed, this, was, the, temporary, end, of, the, wooden, tubs, age, of, sake, and, the, use, of, wooden, tubs, in, brewing, was, temporarily, eliminated, in, japan, sake, has, long, been, taxed, by, the, national, government, in, 1878, the, liquor, tax, accounted, for, 12, 3, of, the, national, tax, revenue, excluding, local, taxes, and, in, 1888, it, was, 26, 4, and, in, 1899, it, was, 38, 8, finally, surpassing, the, land, tax, of, 35, 6, in, 1899, the, government, banned, home, brewing, in, anticipation, of, financial, pressure, from, the, first, sino, japanese, war, and, in, preparation, for, the, russo, japanese, war, since, home, brewed, sake, is, tax, free, the, logic, was, that, by, banning, the, home, brewing, of, sake, sales, would, increase, and, more, tax, revenue, would, be, collected, this, was, the, end, of, home, brewed, sake, the, meiji, government, adopted, a, system, in, which, taxes, were, collected, when, sake, was, finished, instead, of, levying, taxes, on, the, amount, and, price, of, sake, at, the, time, of, sale, to, ensure, more, revenue, from, liquor, taxes, the, liquor, tax, for, the, sake, produced, in, a, given, year, had, to, be, paid, to, the, government, during, that, fiscal, year, so, the, breweries, tried, to, make, money, by, selling, the, sake, as, soon, as, possible, this, destroyed, the, market, for, aged, koshu, which, had, been, popular, until, then, and, it, was, only, in, 1955, that, sake, breweries, began, to, make, koshu, again, when, world, war, ii, brought, rice, shortages, the, sake, brewing, industry, was, hampered, as, the, government, discouraged, the, use, of, rice, for, brewing, as, early, as, the, late, 17th, century, it, had, been, discovered, that, small, amounts, of, distilled, alcohol, could, be, added, to, sake, before, pressing, to, extract, aromas, and, flavors, from, the, rice, solids, during, the, war, large, amounts, of, distilled, alcohol, and, glucose, were, added, to, small, quantities, of, rice, mash, increasing, the, yield, by, as, much, as, four, times, a, few, breweries, were, producing, sake, that, contained, no, rice, the, quality, of, sake, during, this, time, varied, considerably, incidentally, as, of, 2022, so, much, distilled, alcohol, is, not, allowed, to, be, added, and, under, the, provisions, of, the, liquor, tax, act, 50, of, the, weight, of, rice, is, the, upper, limit, for, the, most, inexpensive, sake, classified, as, futs, shu, after, the, war, the, breweries, gradually, recovered, and, the, quality, of, sake, steadily, improved, and, there, were, various, innovations, in, sake, brewing, the, term, ginz, which, means, carefully, brewed, sake, first, appeared, at, the, end, of, the, edo, period, and, the, term, ginj, which, has, the, same, meaning, first, appeared, in, 1894, however, ginj, shu, which, is, popular, in, the, world, today, was, created, by, the, development, of, various, sake, production, techniques, from, the, 1930s, to, around, 1975, from, 1930, to, 1931, a, new, type, of, rice, milling, machine, was, invented, which, made, it, possible, to, make, rice, with, a, polishing, ratio, of, about, 50, removing, the, miscellaneous, taste, derived, from, the, surface, part, of, the, rice, grain, to, make, sake, with, a, more, aromatic, and, refreshing, taste, than, before, in, 1936, yamada, nishiki, the, most, suitable, sake, rice, for, brewing, ginj, shu, became, the, recommended, variety, of, hyogo, prefecture, around, 1953, the, kyokai, yeast, no, 9, kyokai, kyu, g, k, bo, 9, was, invented, which, produced, fruit, like, aromas, like, apples, and, bananas, but, also, excelled, in, fermentation, from, around, 1965, more, and, more, manufacturers, began, to, work, on, the, research, and, development, of, ginj, shu, and, by, about, 1968, the, kyokai, yeast, no, 9, began, to, be, used, throughout, japan, in, the, 1970s, temperature, control, technology, in, the, mash, production, process, improved, dramatically, and, by, slowly, fermenting, rice, at, low, temperatures, using, high, milled, rice, and, a, newly, developed, yeast, ginj, shu, with, a, fruity, flavor, was, created, at, that, time, ginj, shu, was, a, special, sake, exhibited, at, competitive, exhibitions, and, was, not, on, the, market, from, around, 1975, ginj, shu, began, to, be, marketed, and, was, widely, distributed, in, the, 1980s, and, in, 1990, with, the, definition, of, what, can, be, labeled, as, ginj, shu, more, and, more, brewers, began, to, sell, ginj, shu, the, growing, popularity, of, ginj, shu, has, prompted, research, into, yeast, and, many, yeasts, with, various, aromas, optimized, for, ginj, shu, have, been, developed, in, 1973, the, national, tax, agency, s, brewing, research, institute, developed, kij, shu, new, players, on, the, scene, beer, wine, and, spirits, became, popular, in, japan, and, in, the, 1960s, beer, consumption, surpassed, sake, for, the, first, time, sake, consumption, continued, to, decrease, while, the, quality, of, sake, steadily, improved, while, the, rest, of, the, world, may, be, drinking, more, sake, and, the, quality, of, sake, has, been, increasing, sake, production, in, japan, has, been, declining, since, the, mid, 1970s, the, number, of, sake, breweries, is, also, declining, while, there, were, 3, 229, breweries, nationwide, in, fiscal, 1975, the, number, had, fallen, to, 1, 845, in, 2007, in, recent, years, exports, have, rapidly, increased, due, to, the, growing, popularity, of, sake, worldwide, the, value, of, sake, exports, in, 2022, was, more, than, six, times, that, of, 2009, as, of, 2022, the, value, of, japan, s, alcoholic, beverage, exports, was, approximately, 139, 2, billion, yen, with, japanese, whisky, in, first, place, at, 56, 1, billion, yen, and, sake, in, second, place, at, 47, 5, billion, yen, today, sake, has, become, a, world, beverage, with, a, few, breweries, in, china, southeast, asia, south, america, north, america, and, australia, in, addition, to, aspergillus, oryzae, yellow, k, ji, aspergillus, kawachii, white, k, ji, and, aspergillus, luchuensis, black, k, ji, which, are, used, to, brew, sh, ch, and, awamori, have, been, used, to, brew, sake, since, the, 21st, century, more, breweries, are, also, turning, to, older, methods, of, production, for, example, since, the, 21st, century, the, use, of, wooden, tubs, has, increased, again, due, to, the, development, of, sanitary, techniques, the, use, of, wooden, tubs, for, fermentation, has, the, advantage, of, allowing, various, microorganisms, living, in, the, wood, to, affect, sake, allowing, more, complex, fermentation, and, producing, sake, with, different, characteristics, it, is, also, known, that, the, antioxidants, contained, in, wood, have, a, positive, effect, on, sake, the, oldest, sake, brewing, company, still, in, operation, as, confirmed, by, historical, documents, is, the, sudo, honke, in, kasama, ibaraki, founded, in, 1141, during, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, sud, honke, was, also, the, first, sake, brewery, to, sell, both, namazake, and, hiyaoroshi, hiyaoroshi, refers, to, sake, that, is, finished, in, winter, pasteurized, once, in, early, spring, stored, and, aged, for, a, little, while, during, the, summer, and, shipped, in, the, fall, without, being, pasteurized, a, second, time, in, terms, of, excavated, archaeological, evidence, the, oldest, known, sake, brewery, is, from, the, 15th, century, near, an, area, that, was, owned, by, tenry, ji, in, uky, ku, kyoto, unrefined, sake, was, squeezed, out, at, the, brewery, and, there, are, about, 180, holes, 60, cm, wide, 20, cm, deep, for, holding, storage, jars, a, hollow, 1, 8, meter, wide, 1, meter, deep, for, a, pot, to, collect, drops, of, pressed, sake, and, 14th, century, bizen, ware, jars, were, also, found, it, is, estimated, to, be, utilized, until, the, onin, war, 1467, 1477, sake, was, brewed, at, tenry, ji, during, the, muromachi, period, 1336, 1573, the, rice, used, for, brewing, sake, is, called, sakamai, sake, rice, or, officially, shuz, k, tekimai, sake, brewing, suitable, rice, there, are, at, least, 123, types, of, sake, rice, in, japan, among, these, yamada, nishiki, gohyakumangoku, ja, miyama, nishiki, ja, and, omachi, ja, rice, are, popular, the, grain, is, larger, stronger, if, a, grain, is, small, or, weak, it, will, break, in, the, process, of, polishing, and, contains, less, protein, and, lipid, than, ordinary, table, rice, because, of, the, cost, ordinary, table, rice, which, is, cheaper, than, sake, rice, is, sometimes, used, for, sake, brewing, but, because, sake, rice, has, been, improved, and, optimized, for, sake, brewing, few, people, eat, it, premium, sake, is, mostly, made, from, sake, rice, however, non, premium, sake, is, mostly, made, from, table, rice, according, to, the, japan, sake, and, shochu, makers, association, premium, sake, makes, up, 25, of, total, sake, production, and, non, premium, sake, futsushu, makes, up, 75, of, sake, production, in, 2008, a, total, of, 180, 000, tons, of, polished, rice, were, used, in, sake, brewing, of, which, sake, rice, accounted, for, 44, 000, tons, 24, and, table, rice, accounted, for, 136, 000, tons, 76, sake, rice, is, usually, polished, to, a, much, higher, degree, than, ordinary, table, rice, the, reason, for, polishing, is, a, result, of, the, composition, and, structure, of, the, rice, grain, itself, the, core, of, the, rice, grain, is, rich, in, starch, while, the, outer, layers, of, the, grain, contain, higher, concentrations, of, fats, vitamins, and, proteins, since, a, higher, concentration, of, fat, and, protein, in, the, sake, would, lead, to, off, flavors, and, contribute, rough, elements, to, the, sake, the, outer, layers, of, the, sake, rice, grain, is, milled, away, in, a, polishing, process, leaving, only, the, starchy, part, of, the, grain, some, sake, brewers, remove, over, 60, of, the, rice, grain, in, the, polishing, process, that, desirable, pocket, of, starch, in, the, center, of, the, grain, is, called, the, shinpaku, it, usually, takes, two, to, three, days, to, polish, rice, down, to, less, than, half, its, original, size, the, rice, powder, by, product, of, polishing, is, often, used, for, making, rice, crackers, japanese, sweets, i, e, dango, and, other, food, stuffs, if, the, sake, is, made, with, rice, with, a, higher, percentage, of, its, husk, and, the, outer, portion, of, the, core, milled, off, then, more, rice, will, be, required, to, make, that, particular, sake, which, will, take, longer, to, produce, thus, sake, made, with, rice, that, has, been, highly, milled, is, usually, more, expensive, than, sake, that, has, been, made, with, less, polished, rice, this, does, not, always, mean, that, sake, made, with, highly, milled, rice, is, of, better, quality, than, sake, made, with, rice, milled, less, sake, made, with, highly, milled, rice, has, a, strong, aroma, and, a, light, taste, without, miscellaneous, taste, it, maximizes, the, fruity, flavor, of, ginj, on, the, other, hand, sake, made, with, less, milled, rice, but, with, attention, to, various, factors, tends, to, have, a, rich, sweetness, and, flavor, derived, from, rice, rice, polishing, ratio, called, seimai, buai, see, glossary, of, sake, terms, measures, the, degree, of, rice, polishing, for, example, a, rice, polishing, ratio, of, 70, means, that, 70, of, the, original, rice, grain, remains, and, 30, has, been, polished, away, as, of, 2023, the, most, polished, sake, will, have, a, polishing, ratio, of, 0, 85, or, less, with, at, least, 99, 15, of, its, rice, grains, polished, away, this, sake, will, be, reikyo, crystal, 0, crystal, 0, released, by, niizawa, brewery, co, priced, at, 1, 375, 000, yen, for, 720, ml, water, is, involved, in, almost, every, major, sake, brewing, process, from, washing, the, rice, to, diluting, the, final, product, before, bottling, the, mineral, content, of, the, water, can, be, important, in, the, final, product, iron, will, bond, with, an, amino, acid, produced, by, the, k, ji, to, produce, off, flavors, and, a, yellowish, color, manganese, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, will, also, contribute, to, discoloration, conversely, potassium, magnesium, and, phosphoric, acid, serve, as, nutrients, for, yeast, during, fermentation, and, are, considered, desirable, the, yeast, will, use, those, nutrients, to, work, faster, and, multiply, resulting, in, more, sugar, being, converted, into, alcohol, while, soft, water, will, typically, yield, sweeter, sake, hard, water, with, a, higher, mineral, content, is, known, for, producing, drier, style, sake, the, first, region, known, for, having, great, water, was, the, nada, gog, in, hy, go, prefecture, a, particular, water, source, called, miyamizu, was, found, to, produce, high, quality, sake, and, attracted, many, producers, to, the, region, today, hy, go, has, the, most, sake, brewers, of, any, prefecture, typically, breweries, obtain, water, from, wells, though, surface, water, can, be, used, breweries, may, use, tap, water, and, filter, and, adjust, components, aspergillus, oryzae, spores, are, another, important, component, of, sake, a, oryzae, is, an, enzyme, secreting, fungus, in, japan, a, oryzae, is, used, to, make, various, fermented, foods, including, miso, a, paste, made, from, soybeans, and, shoyu, soy, sauce, it, is, also, used, to, make, alcoholic, beverages, notably, sake, during, sake, brewing, spores, of, a, oryzae, are, scattered, over, steamed, rice, to, produce, k, ji, rice, in, which, a, oryzae, spores, are, cultivated, under, warm, and, moist, conditions, the, a, oryzae, spores, germinate, and, release, amylases, enzymes, that, convert, the, rice, starches, into, maltose, and, glucose, this, conversion, of, starch, into, simple, sugars, e, g, glucose, or, maltose, is, called, saccharification, yeast, then, ferment, the, glucose, and, other, sugar, into, alcohol, saccharification, also, occurs, in, beer, brewing, where, mashing, is, used, to, convert, starches, from, barley, into, maltose, however, whereas, fermentation, occurs, after, saccharification, in, beer, brewing, saccharification, via, a, oryzae, and, fermentation, via, yeast, occur, simultaneously, in, sake, brewing, see, fermentation, below, as, a, oryzae, is, a, microorganism, used, to, manufacture, food, its, safety, profile, concerning, humans, and, the, environment, in, sake, brewing, and, other, food, making, processes, must, be, considered, various, health, authorities, including, health, canada, and, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, consider, a, oryzae, generally, safe, for, use, in, food, fermentation, including, sake, brewing, when, assessing, its, safety, it, is, important, to, note, that, a, oryzae, lacks, the, ability, to, produce, toxins, unlike, the, closely, related, aspergillus, flavus, to, date, there, have, been, several, reported, cases, of, animals, e, g, parrots, a, horse, being, infected, with, a, oryzae, in, these, cases, the, animals, infected, with, a, oryzae, were, already, weakened, due, to, predisposing, conditions, such, as, recent, injury, illness, or, stress, hence, were, susceptible, to, infections, in, general, aside, from, these, cases, there, is, no, evidence, to, indicate, a, oryzae, is, a, harmful, pathogen, to, either, plants, or, animals, in, the, scientific, literature, therefore, health, canada, considers, a, oryzae, unlikely, to, be, a, serious, hazard, to, livestock, or, to, other, organisms, including, healthy, or, debilitated, humans, given, its, safety, record, in, the, scientific, literature, and, extensive, history, of, safe, use, spanning, several, hundred, years, in, the, japanese, food, industry, the, fda, and, world, health, organization, who, also, support, the, safety, of, a, oryzae, for, use, in, the, production, of, foods, like, sake, in, the, us, the, fda, classifies, a, oryzae, as, a, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, organism, in, addition, to, aspergillus, oryzae, yellow, k, ji, aspergillus, kawachii, white, k, ji, and, aspergillus, luchuensis, black, k, ji, which, are, used, to, brew, sh, ch, and, awamori, have, been, used, to, brew, sake, since, the, 21st, century, from, the, 1980s, research, was, conducted, to, brew, sake, using, aspergillus, kawachii, white, k, ji, which, is, used, to, make, sh, ch, and, sake, made, with, aspergillus, kawachii, became, popular, when, aramasa, co, ltd, released, amaneko, using, aspergillus, kawachii, in, 2009, aspergillus, kawachii, produces, about, 10, times, more, citric, acid, than, aspergillus, oryzae, and, thus, has, a, strong, ability, to, suppress, the, growth, of, bacteria, that, damage, the, flavor, of, sake, it, also, imparts, a, sour, citrus, like, flavor, to, sake, because, it, produces, so, much, citric, acid, older, sake, making, methods, such, as, kimoto, or, yamahai, can, produce, a, starter, mash, as, quickly, as, modern, sokuj, kimoto, and, yamahai, do, not, add, artificial, lactic, acid, which, allows, them, to, be, labeled, additive, free, giving, them, a, marketing, advantage, when, exporting, as, of, 2022, sake, made, with, aspergillus, luchuensis, black, k, ji, will, not, be, as, popular, as, sake, made, with, aspergillus, kawachii, it, produces, more, citric, acid, than, aspergillus, kawachii, however, it, produces, less, amino, acids, which, produce, complex, flavors, such, as, umami, bitterness, and, sweetness, and, more, peptides, which, produce, bitterness, resulting, in, a, bitter, taste, from, the, peptides, and, a, strong, sour, taste, from, the, citric, acid, which, is, sometimes, compared, to, strawberry, or, red, wine, sake, fermentation, is, a, three, step, process, called, sandan, shikomi, the, first, step, called, hatsuzoe, involves, steamed, rice, water, and, k, ji, kin, being, added, to, the, yeast, starter, called, shubo, a, mixture, of, steamed, rice, water, k, ji, and, yeast, this, mixture, becomes, known, as, the, moromi, the, main, mash, during, sake, fermentation, the, high, yeast, content, of, the, shubo, promotes, the, fermentation, of, the, moromi, on, the, second, day, the, mixture, stands, for, a, day, to, let, the, yeast, multiply, the, second, step, the, third, day, of, the, process, called, nakazoe, involves, the, addition, of, a, second, batch, of, k, ji, steamed, rice, and, water, to, the, mixture, on, the, fourth, day, of, the, fermentation, the, third, step, of, the, process, called, tomezoe, takes, place, here, the, third, and, final, batch, of, k, ji, steamed, rice, and, water, is, added, to, the, mixture, followed, by, up, to, ten, days, or, so, of, additional, fermentation, to, complete, the, three, step, process, the, multiple, parallel, fermentation, process, of, sake, brewing, where, starch, is, converted, into, glucose, followed, by, immediate, conversion, into, alcohol, is, unique, to, it, this, distinguishes, sake, from, other, brewed, alcoholic, beverages, like, beer, because, it, occurs, in, a, single, vat, whereas, with, beer, for, instance, starch, to, glucose, conversion, and, glucose, to, alcohol, conversion, occur, in, separate, vats, the, breakdown, of, starch, into, glucose, is, caused, by, the, k, ji, kin, fungus, while, the, conversion, of, glucose, into, alcohol, is, caused, by, yeast, due, to, the, yeast, being, available, as, soon, as, the, glucose, is, produced, the, conversion, of, glucose, to, alcohol, is, very, efficient, in, sake, brewing, this, results, in, sake, having, a, generally, higher, alcohol, content, than, other, types, of, beer, or, wine, after, the, fermentation, process, is, complete, the, fermented, moromi, is, pressed, to, remove, the, sake, lees, and, then, pasteurized, and, filtered, for, color, the, sake, is, then, stored, in, bottles, under, cold, conditions, see, maturation, below, the, process, of, making, sake, can, range, from, 60, to, 90, days, 2, 3, months, while, the, fermentation, alone, can, take, two, weeks, on, the, other, hand, ginj, shu, takes, about, 30, days, for, fermentation, alone, like, other, brewed, beverages, sake, tends, to, benefit, from, a, period, of, storage, nine, to, twelve, months, are, required, for, the, sake, to, mature, maturation, is, caused, by, physical, and, chemical, factors, such, as, oxygen, supply, the, broad, application, of, external, heat, nitrogen, oxides, aldehydes, and, amino, acids, among, other, unknown, factors, t, ji, is, the, job, title, of, the, sake, brewer, there, are, various, theories, about, the, origin, of, the, word, but, the, most, popular, is, that, it, is, a, corruption, of, the, word, t, ji, which, was, used, for, housewives, and, elderly, women, who, supervised, miko, shrine, maidens, this, is, because, sake, brewing, was, the, work, of, housewives, at, home, and, miko, at, shinto, shrines, it, is, a, highly, respected, job, in, the, japanese, society, with, t, ji, being, regarded, like, musicians, or, painters, the, title, of, t, ji, was, historically, passed, from, father, to, son, today, new, t, ji, are, either, veteran, brewery, workers, or, are, trained, at, universities, while, modern, breweries, with, cooling, tanks, operate, year, round, most, old, fashioned, sake, breweries, are, seasonal, operating, only, in, the, cool, winter, months, during, the, summer, and, fall, most, t, ji, work, elsewhere, commonly, on, farms, only, periodically, returning, to, the, brewery, to, supervise, storage, conditions, or, bottling, operations, there, are, two, basic, types, of, sake, futs, shu, ordinary, sake, and, tokutei, meish, shu, special, designation, sake, futs, shu, is, the, equivalent, of, table, wine, and, accounts, for, 57, of, sake, production, as, of, 2020, tokutei, meish, shu, refers, to, premium, sake, distinguished, by, the, degree, to, which, the, rice, has, been, polished, and, the, added, percentage, of, brewer, s, alcohol, or, the, absence, of, such, additives, there, are, eight, varieties, of, special, designation, sake, ginj, is, sake, made, using, a, special, method, called, ginj, zukuri, in, which, rice, is, slowly, fermented, for, about, 30, days, at, a, low, temperature, of, 5, to, 10, degrees, celsius, 41, to, 50, degrees, fahrenheit, sake, made, in, ginj, zukuri, is, characterized, by, fruity, flavors, like, apples, bananas, melons, grapes, peaches, pineapples, citrus, etc, in, general, the, flavor, of, sake, tends, to, deteriorate, when, it, is, affected, by, ultraviolet, rays, or, high, temperatures, especially, for, sake, made, in, ginj, zukuri, and, un, pasteurized, namazake, therefore, it, is, recommended, that, sake, with, the, name, ginj, be, transported, and, stored, in, cold, storage, it, is, also, recommended, to, drink, chilled, to, maximize, its, fruity, flavor, junmai, is, a, term, used, for, the, sake, that, is, made, of, pure, rice, wine, without, any, additional, distilled, alcohol, special, designation, sake, which, is, not, labeled, junmai, has, an, appropriate, amount, of, distilled, alcohol, added, the, maximum, amount, of, distilled, alcohol, added, to, futs, shu, is, 50, of, the, rice, weight, mainly, to, increase, the, volume, while, the, maximum, amount, of, distilled, alcohol, added, to, special, designation, sake, is, 10, of, the, rice, weight, to, make, the, sake, more, aromatic, and, light, in, taste, and, to, prevent, the, growth, of, lactic, acid, bacteria, which, deteriorate, the, flavor, of, the, sake, it, is, often, misunderstood, that, the, added, distilled, alcohol, is, of, poor, quality, but, that, is, not, the, case, with, the, addition, of, distilled, alcohol, to, special, designation, sake, specifically, 78, 3, of, the, sake, entered, in, the, zenkoku, shinshu, kanpy, kai, national, new, sake, appraisal, the, largest, sake, contest, had, distilled, alcohol, added, and, 91, 1, of, the, winning, sake, had, it, added, however, the, most, important, aspect, of, the, contest, is, the, brewing, technique, not, whether, it, tastes, good, or, not, sake, made, with, highly, milled, rice, has, a, strong, aroma, and, a, light, taste, without, miscellaneous, taste, it, maximizes, the, fruity, flavor, of, ginj, on, the, other, hand, sake, made, with, less, milled, rice, but, with, attention, to, various, factors, tends, to, have, a, rich, sweetness, and, flavor, derived, from, rice, the, certification, requirements, for, special, designation, sake, must, meet, the, conditions, listed, below, as, well, as, the, superior, aroma, and, color, specified, by, the, national, tax, agency, the, listing, below, often, has, the, highest, price, at, the, top, the, characteristics, of, sake, listed, below, are, generally, described, on, the, label, attached, to, the, sake, bottle, for, example, shiboritate, muroka, nama, genshu, indicates, that, all, the, conditions, of, shiboritate, muroka, namazake, and, genshu, below, are, satisfied, some, other, terms, commonly, used, in, connection, with, sake, the, label, on, a, bottle, of, sake, gives, a, rough, indication, of, its, taste, terms, found, on, the, label, may, include, nihonshu, do, san, do, and, aminosan, do, nihonshu, do, or, sake, meter, value, smv, is, calculated, from, the, specific, gravity, of, the, sake, and, indicates, the, sugar, and, alcohol, content, of, the, sake, on, an, arbitrary, scale, typical, values, are, between, 3, sweet, and, 10, dry, equivalent, to, specific, gravities, ranging, between, 1, 007, and, 0, 998, though, the, maximum, range, of, nihonshu, do, can, go, much, beyond, that, the, nihonshu, do, must, be, considered, together, with, san, do, to, determine, the, overall, perception, of, dryness, sweetness, richness, lightness, characteristics, of, a, sake, for, example, a, higher, level, of, acidity, can, make, a, sweet, sake, taste, drier, than, it, actually, is, san, do, indicates, the, concentration, of, acid, which, is, determined, by, titration, with, sodium, hydroxide, solution, this, number, equals, the, milliliters, of, titrant, required, to, neutralize, the, acid, in, 10, ml, 0, 35, imp, fl, oz, 0, 34, us, fl, oz, of, sake, aminosan, do, indicates, a, taste, of, umami, or, savoriness, as, the, proportion, of, amino, acids, rises, the, sake, tastes, more, savory, this, number, is, determined, by, titration, of, the, sake, with, a, mixture, of, sodium, hydroxide, solution, and, formaldehyde, and, is, equal, to, the, milliliters, of, titrant, required, to, neutralize, the, amino, acids, in, 10, ml, of, sake, sake, can, have, many, flavor, notes, such, as, fruits, flowers, herbs, and, spices, many, types, of, sake, have, notes, of, apple, from, ethyl, caproate, and, banana, from, isoamyl, acetate, particularly, ginj, shu, in, addition, to, apples, and, bananas, other, fruits, mentioned, as, flavor, notes, for, fruity, sake, especially, ginj, shu, include, melons, grapes, peaches, pineapples, citrus, etc, in, japan, sake, is, served, chilled, reishu, at, room, temperature, j, on, or, heated, atsukan, depending, on, the, preference, of, the, drinker, the, characteristics, of, the, sake, and, the, season, typically, hot, sake, is, a, winter, drink, and, high, grade, sake, is, not, usually, drunk, hot, because, the, flavors, and, aromas, may, be, lost, most, lower, quality, sake, is, served, hot, because, that, is, the, traditional, way, and, it, often, tastes, better, that, way, not, so, that, flaws, are, covered, up, there, are, gradations, of, temperature, both, for, chilling, and, heating, about, every, 5, c, 9, 0, f, with, hot, sake, generally, served, around, 50, c, 122, f, and, chilled, sake, around, 10, c, 50, f, like, white, wine, hot, sake, that, has, cooled, kanzamashi, may, be, reheated, sake, is, traditionally, drunk, from, small, cups, called, choko, or, o, choko, and, poured, into, the, choko, from, ceramic, flasks, called, tokkuri, this, is, very, common, for, hot, sake, where, the, flask, is, heated, in, hot, water, and, the, small, cups, ensure, that, the, sake, does, not, get, cold, in, the, cup, but, it, may, also, be, used, for, chilled, sake, traditionally, one, does, not, pour, one, s, own, drink, which, is, known, as, tejaku, but, instead, members, of, a, party, pour, for, each, other, which, is, known, as, shaku, this, has, relaxed, in, recent, years, but, is, generally, observed, on, more, formal, occasions, such, as, business, meals, and, is, still, often, observed, for, the, first, drink, another, traditional, cup, is, the, masu, a, box, usually, made, of, hinoki, or, sugi, which, was, originally, used, for, measuring, rice, the, masu, holds, exactly, one, g, 180, 4, ml, 6, 35, imp, fl, oz, 6, 10, us, fl, oz, so, the, sake, is, served, by, filling, the, masu, to, the, brim, this, is, done, for, chilled, or, room, temperature, sake, in, some, japanese, restaurants, as, a, show, of, generosity, the, server, may, put, a, glass, inside, the, masu, or, put, the, masu, on, a, saucer, and, pour, until, sake, overflows, and, fills, both, containers, sake, is, traditionally, served, in, units, of, g, and, this, is, still, common, but, other, sizes, are, sometimes, also, available, saucer, like, cups, called, sakazuki, are, also, used, most, commonly, at, weddings, and, other, ceremonial, occasions, such, as, the, start, of, the, year, or, the, beginning, of, a, kaiseki, meal, in, cheap, bars, sake, is, often, served, at, room, temperature, in, glass, tumblers, and, called, koppu, zake, in, more, modern, restaurants, wine, glasses, are, also, used, and, recently, footed, glasses, made, specifically, for, premium, sake, have, also, come, into, use, traditionally, sake, is, heated, immediately, before, serving, but, today, restaurants, may, buy, sake, in, boxes, that, can, be, heated, in, a, specialized, hot, sake, dispenser, thus, allowing, hot, sake, to, be, served, immediately, however, this, is, detrimental, to, the, flavor, there, are, also, a, variety, of, devices, for, heating, sake, and, keeping, it, warm, beyond, the, traditional, tokkuri, aside, from, being, served, straight, sake, can, be, used, as, a, mixer, for, cocktails, such, as, tamagozake, saketinis, or, nogasake, outside, of, japan, the, sake, bomb, the, origins, of, which, are, unclear, has, become, a, popular, drink, in, bars, and, asia, themed, karaoke, clubs, the, japanese, sake, association, encourages, people, to, drink, chaser, water, for, their, health, and, the, water, is, called, yawaragi, mizu, because, the, cooler, temperatures, make, it, more, difficult, for, bacteria, to, grow, sake, brewing, traditionally, took, place, mainly, in, winter, and, this, was, especially, true, from, 1673, during, the, edo, period, until, the, early, 20th, century, during, the, showa, era, while, it, can, now, be, brewed, year, round, seasonality, is, still, associated, with, sake, particularly, artisanal, ones, the, most, visible, symbol, of, this, is, the, sugitama, a, globe, of, cedar, leaves, traditionally, hung, outside, a, brewery, when, the, new, sake, is, brewed, the, leaves, start, green, but, turn, brown, over, time, reflecting, the, maturation, of, the, sake, these, are, now, hung, outside, many, restaurants, serving, sake, the, new, year, s, sake, is, called, shinshu, new, sake, and, when, initially, released, in, late, winter, or, early, spring, many, brewers, have, a, celebration, known, as, kurabiraki, warehouse, opening, traditionally, sake, was, best, transported, in, the, cool, spring, to, avoid, spoilage, in, the, summer, heat, with, a, secondary, transport, in, autumn, once, the, weather, had, cooled, known, as, hiyaoroshi, cold, wholesale, distribution, this, autumn, sake, has, matured, over, the, summer, sake, is, sold, in, volume, units, divisible, by, 180, ml, 6, 3, imp, fl, oz, 6, 1, us, fl, oz, one, g, the, traditional, japanese, unit, for, cup, size, sake, is, traditionally, sold, by, the, g, sized, cup, or, in, a, 1, 8, l, 63, imp, fl, oz, 61, us, fl, oz, one, sh, or, ten, g, sized, flask, called, an, issh, bin, or, one, sh, measure, bottle, today, sake, is, also, often, sold, in, 720, ml, 25, imp, fl, oz, 24, us, fl, oz, bottles, which, are, divisible, into, four, g, note, that, this, is, almost, the, same, as, the, 750, ml, 26, imp, fl, oz, 25, us, fl, oz, standard, for, wine, bottles, which, is, divisible, into, four, quarter, bottles, 187ml, particularly, in, convenience, stores, sake, generally, of, cheap, quality, may, be, sold, in, a, small, 360, ml, 13, imp, fl, oz, 12, us, fl, oz, bottle, or, a, single, serving, 180, ml, 6, 3, imp, fl, oz, 6, 1, us, fl, oz, one, g, glass, with, a, pull, off, top, kappu, zake, generally, it, is, best, to, keep, sake, refrigerated, in, a, cool, or, dark, room, as, prolonged, exposure, to, heat, or, direct, light, will, lead, to, spoilage, sake, stored, at, a, relatively, high, temperature, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, diketopiperazine, a, cyclo, pro, leu, that, makes, it, bitter, as, it, ages, sake, has, high, microbiological, stability, due, to, its, high, content, of, ethanol, but, instances, of, spoilage, have, occurred, one, of, the, microorganisms, implicated, in, this, spoilage, is, lactic, acid, bacteria, lab, that, has, grown, tolerant, to, ethanol, and, is, referred, to, as, hiochi, bacteria, sake, stored, at, room, temperature, is, best, consumed, within, a, few, months, after, purchase, sake, can, be, stored, for, a, long, time, due, to, its, high, alcohol, content, and, has, no, use, by, dates, written, on, the, bottle, or, label, however, there, is, a, best, before, date, for, good, drinking, and, it, depends, on, the, type, of, sake, with, the, typical, twice, pasteurized, sake, having, a, relatively, long, best, before, date, according, to, major, sake, brewer, gekkeikan, the, best, before, date, when, unopened, and, stored, in, a, dark, place, at, about, 20, degrees, celsius, 68, degrees, fahrenheit, is, one, year, after, production, for, futs, shu, and, honj, z, shu, 10, months, for, ginj, shu, junmai, shu, and, sake, pasteurized, only, once, and, up, to, eight, months, for, special, namazake, that, can, be, distributed, at, room, temperature, according, to, sawanotsuru, once, pasteurized, sake, and, unpasteurized, namazake, have, a, best, before, date, of, nine, months, after, production, some, sources, also, state, that, the, best, before, date, for, unpasteurized, namazake, is, three, to, six, months, after, production, namazake, generally, requires, refrigeration, at, all, times, however, there, are, exceptions, to, these, storage, conditions, in, which, case, the, conditions, are, stated, on, the, label, for, example, sake, under, the, brand, name, aramasa, must, be, kept, refrigerated, at, all, times, even, if, it, is, junmai, shu, which, has, been, pasteurized, once, the, sake, is, opened, it, should, be, kept, refrigerated, as, the, flavor, deteriorates, more, quickly, than, before, opening, best, before, date, after, opening, the, bottle, varies, depending, on, the, source, according, to, sake, media, outlet, sake, no, shizuku, which, interviewed, several, major, sake, production, companies, the, responses, from, all, companies, were, nearly, identical, according, to, the, responses, junmai, type, sake, without, added, distilled, alcohol, has, a, best, before, date, of, 10, days, after, opening, while, other, types, of, sake, with, added, distilled, alcohol, has, a, best, before, date, of, one, month, after, opening, according, to, the, international, sommelier, of, sake, certified, by, ssi, international, ginj, type, sake, which, is, fermented, at, low, temperature, for, a, long, time, has, little, flavor, degradation, for, two, to, three, days, after, opening, and, has, a, best, before, date, of, one, week, after, opening, other, special, designation, sake, and, futs, shu, have, little, flavor, degradation, for, 10, to, 14, days, after, opening, the, bottle, and, have, a, best, before, date, of, one, month, after, opening, unpasteurized, namazake, deteriorates, the, fastest, and, should, be, drunk, as, soon, as, possible, these, best, before, dates, are, shortened, when, stored, at, high, temperatures, or, in, bright, places, especially, under, sunlight, or, fluorescent, lights, that, emit, ultraviolet, rays, on, the, other, hand, the, optimal, temperature, to, minimize, flavor, degradation, is, minus, 5, degrees, celsius, 23, degrees, fahrenheit, it, is, also, recommended, that, sake, bottles, be, stored, vertically, this, is, because, if, the, bottle, is, placed, horizontally, the, sake, is, exposed, to, more, air, inside, the, bottle, which, speeds, up, oxidation, and, may, change, the, flavor, when, it, comes, in, contact, with, the, cap, if, these, types, of, sake, which, were, clear, or, white, at, first, turn, yellow, or, brown, it, is, a, sign, that, the, flavor, has, deteriorated, the, exception, is, aged, koshu, which, is, amber, in, color, from, the, time, of, shipment, because, it, has, been, aged, for, several, years, to, optimize, its, flavor, sake, is, often, consumed, as, part, of, shinto, purification, rituals, sake, served, to, gods, as, offerings, before, drinking, are, called, o, miki, or, miki, in, a, ceremony, called, kagami, biraki, wooden, sake, casks, are, opened, with, mallets, during, shinto, festivals, weddings, store, openings, sports, and, election, victories, and, other, celebrations, this, sake, called, iwai, zake, celebration, sake, is, served, freely, to, all, to, spread, good, fortune, at, the, new, year, many, japanese, people, drink, a, special, sake, called, toso, toso, is, a, sort, of, iwai, zake, made, by, soaking, tososan, a, kampo, traditional, japanese, medicine, overnight, in, sake, even, children, sip, a, portion, in, some, regions, the, first, sips, of, toso, are, taken, in, order, of, age, from, the, youngest, to, the, eldest, on, children, s, day, may, 5, there, is, a, custom, of, drinking, sh, bu, sake, which, is, made, by, cutting, iris, roots, and, leaves, into, thin, slices, and, soaking, them, in, sake, a, tradition, inherited, from, tango, no, sekku, it, is, believed, that, iris, has, the, power, to, ward, off, evil, spirits, and, has, medicinal, properties
