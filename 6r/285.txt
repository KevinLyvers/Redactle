that, on, april, 26, 1336, with, his, brother, and, two, servants, he, climbed, to, the, top, of, mont, ventoux, 1, 912, meters, 6, 273, ft, a, feat, which, he, undertook, for, recreation, rather, than, necessity, the, exploit, is, described, in, a, celebrated, letter, addressed, to, his, friend, and, confessor, the, monk, dionigi, di, borgo, san, sepolcro, composed, some, time, after, the, fact, however, some, have, suggested, that, petrarch, s, climb, was, fictional, jakob, burckhardt, in, the, civilization, of, the, renaissance, in, italy, in, german, in, 1860, declared, petrarch, a, truly, modern, man, because, of, the, significance, of, nature, for, his, receptive, spirit, even, if, he, did, not, yet, have, the, skill, to, describe, nature, petrarch, s, implication, that, he, was, the, first, to, climb, mountains, for, pleasure, and, burckhardt, s, insistence, on, petrarch, s, sensitivity, to, nature, have, been, often, repeated, since, there, are, also, numerous, references, to, petrarch, as, an, alpinist, although, mont, ventoux, is, not, a, hard, climb, and, is, not, usually, considered, part, of, the, alps, this, implicit, claim, of, petrarch, and, burckhardt, that, petrarch, was, the, first, to, climb, a, mountain, for, pleasure, since, antiquity, was, disproven, by, lynn, thorndike, in, 1943, 69, 74, mount, ventoux, was, climbed, by, jean, buridan, on, his, way, to, the, papal, court, in, avignon, before, the, year, 1334, in, order, to, make, some, meteorological, observations, there, were, ascents, accomplished, during, the, middle, ages, 69, 74, lynn, thorndike, mentions, that, a, book, on, feeling, for, nature, in, germany, in, the, tenth, and, eleventh, centuries, noted, various, ascents, and, descriptions, of, mountains, from, that, period, and, that, in, the, closing, years, of, his, life, archbishop, anno, ii, archbishop, of, cologne, c, 1010, 1075, climbed, his, beloved, mountain, oftener, than, usual, 71, 72, other, early, examples, of, individuals, hiking, or, climbing, mountains, for, pleasure, include, the, roman, emperor, hadrian, who, ascended, mount, etna, during, a, return, trip, from, greece, in, 125, ce, in, 1275, peter, iii, of, aragon, claimed, to, have, reached, the, summit, of, pic, du, canigou, a, 9134, foot, mountain, located, near, the, southern, tip, of, france, the, first, ascent, of, any, technical, difficulty, to, be, officially, verified, took, place, on, june, 26, 1492, when, antoine, de, ville, a, chamberlain, and, military, engineer, for, charles, viii, king, of, france, was, ordered, to, ascend, mont, aiguille, because, ropes, ladders, and, iron, hooks, were, used, during, the, ascent, this, event, is, widely, recognized, as, being, the, birth, of, mountaineering, conrad, gessner, a, 16th, century, physician, botanist, and, naturalist, from, switzerland, is, widely, recognized, as, being, the, first, person, to, hike, and, climb, for, sheer, pleasure, however, the, idea, of, taking, a, walk, in, the, countryside, only, really, developed, during, the, 18th, century, in, europe, and, arose, because, of, changing, attitudes, to, the, landscape, and, nature, associated, with, the, romantic, movement, in, earlier, times, walking, generally, indicated, poverty, and, was, also, associated, with, vagrancy, 83, 297, in, previous, centuries, long, walks, were, undertaken, as, part, of, religious, pilgrimages, and, this, tradition, continues, throughout, the, world, the, swiss, scientist, and, poet, albrecht, von, haller, s, poem, die, alpen, 1732, is, an, historically, important, early, sign, of, an, awakening, appreciation, of, the, mountains, though, it, is, chiefly, designed, to, contrast, the, simple, and, idyllic, life, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, alps, with, the, corrupt, and, decadent, existence, of, the, dwellers, in, the, plains, numerous, travellers, explored, europe, on, foot, in, the, last, third, of, the, 18th, century, and, recorded, their, experiences, a, significant, example, is, johann, gottfried, seume, who, set, out, on, foot, from, leipzig, to, sicily, in, 1801, and, returned, to, leipzig, via, paris, after, nine, months, thomas, west, a, scottish, priest, popularized, the, idea, of, walking, for, pleasure, in, his, guide, to, the, lake, district, of, 1778, in, the, introduction, he, wrote, that, he, aimed, to, encourage, the, taste, of, visiting, the, lakes, by, furnishing, the, traveller, with, a, guide, and, for, that, purpose, the, writer, has, here, collected, and, laid, before, him, all, the, select, stations, and, points, of, view, noticed, by, those, authors, who, have, last, made, the, tour, of, the, lakes, verified, by, his, own, repeated, observations, to, this, end, he, included, various, stations, or, viewpoints, around, the, lakes, from, which, tourists, would, be, encouraged, to, enjoy, the, views, in, terms, of, their, aesthetic, qualities, published, in, 1778, the, book, was, a, major, success, another, famous, early, exponent, of, walking, for, pleasure, was, the, english, poet, william, wordsworth, in, 1790, he, embarked, on, an, extended, tour, of, france, switzerland, and, germany, a, journey, subsequently, recorded, in, his, long, autobiographical, poem, the, prelude, 1850, his, famous, poem, tintern, abbey, was, inspired, by, a, visit, to, the, wye, valley, made, during, a, walking, tour, of, wales, in, 1798, with, his, sister, dorothy, wordsworth, wordsworth, s, friend, coleridge, was, another, keen, walker, and, in, the, autumn, of, 1799, he, and, wordsworth, undertook, a, three, week, tour, of, the, lake, district, john, keats, who, belonged, to, the, next, generation, of, romantic, poets, began, in, june, 1818, a, walking, tour, of, scotland, ireland, and, the, lake, district, with, his, friend, charles, armitage, brown, more, and, more, people, undertook, walking, tours, through, the, 19th, century, of, which, the, most, famous, is, probably, robert, louis, stevenson, s, journey, through, the, c, vennes, in, france, with, a, donkey, recorded, in, his, travels, with, a, donkey, 1879, stevenson, also, published, in, 1876, his, famous, essay, walking, tours, the, subgenre, of, travel, writing, produced, many, classics, in, the, subsequent, 20th, century, an, early, american, example, of, a, book, that, describes, an, extended, walking, tour, is, naturalist, john, muir, s, a, thousand, mile, walk, to, the, gulf, 1916, a, posthumously, published, account, of, a, long, botanizing, walk, undertaken, in, 1867, due, to, industrialisation, in, england, people, began, to, migrate, to, the, cities, where, living, standards, were, often, cramped, and, unsanitary, they, would, escape, the, confines, of, the, city, by, rambling, about, in, the, countryside, however, the, land, in, england, particularly, around, the, urban, areas, of, manchester, and, sheffield, was, privately, owned, and, trespass, was, illegal, rambling, clubs, soon, sprang, up, in, the, north, and, began, politically, campaigning, for, the, legal, right, to, roam, one, of, the, first, such, clubs, was, sunday, tramps, founded, by, leslie, white, in, 1879, the, first, national, grouping, the, federation, of, rambling, clubs, was, formed, in, london, in, 1905, and, was, heavily, patronized, by, the, peerage, access, to, mountains, bills, that, would, have, legislated, the, public, s, right, to, roam, across, some, private, land, were, periodically, presented, to, parliament, from, 1884, to, 1932, without, success, finally, in, 1932, the, rambler, s, right, movement, organized, a, mass, trespass, on, kinder, scout, in, derbyshire, despite, attempts, on, the, part, of, the, police, to, prevent, the, trespass, from, going, ahead, it, was, successfully, achieved, due, to, massive, publicity, however, the, mountain, access, bill, that, was, passed, in, 1939, was, opposed, by, many, walkers, organizations, including, the, ramblers, who, felt, that, it, did, not, sufficiently, protect, their, rights, and, it, was, eventually, repealed, the, effort, to, improve, access, led, after, world, war, ii, to, the, national, parks, and, access, to, the, countryside, act, 1949, and, in, 1951, to, the, creation, of, the, first, national, park, in, the, uk, the, peak, district, national, park, the, establishment, of, this, and, similar, national, parks, helped, to, improve, access, for, all, outdoors, enthusiasts, the, countryside, and, rights, of, way, act, 2000, considerably, extended, the, right, to, roam, in, england, and, wales, an, early, example, of, an, interest, in, hiking, in, the, united, states, is, abel, crawford, and, his, son, ethan, s, clearing, of, a, trail, to, the, summit, of, mount, washington, new, hampshire, in, 1819, this, 8, 5, mile, path, is, the, oldest, continually, used, hiking, trail, in, the, united, states, the, influence, of, british, and, european, romanticism, reached, north, america, through, the, transcendentalist, movement, and, both, ralph, waldo, emerson, 1803, 82, and, henry, david, thoreau, 1817, 62, were, important, influences, on, the, outdoors, movement, in, north, america, thoreau, s, writing, on, nature, and, on, walking, include, the, posthumously, published, walking, 1862, his, earlier, essay, a, walk, to, wachusett, 1842, describes, a, four, day, walking, tour, thoreau, took, with, a, companion, from, concord, massachusetts, to, the, summit, of, mount, wachusett, princeton, massachusetts, and, back, established, in, 1876, the, appalachian, mountain, club, has, the, distinction, of, being, the, oldest, hiking, club, in, america, it, was, founded, to, protect, the, trails, and, mountains, in, the, northeastern, united, states, prior, to, its, founding, four, other, hiking, clubs, had, already, been, established, in, america, this, included, the, very, short, lived, first, rocky, mountain, club, in, 1875, the, white, mountain, club, of, portland, in, 1873, the, alpine, club, of, williamstown, in, 1863, and, the, exploring, circle, which, was, established, by, four, men, from, lynn, massachusetts, in, 1850, although, not, a, hiking, club, in, the, same, sense, as, the, clubs, that, would, emerge, later, the, national, park, service, recognizes, the, exploring, circle, as, being, the, first, hiking, club, in, new, england, all, four, of, these, clubs, would, disband, within, a, few, years, of, their, founding, despite, clubs, such, as, the, appalachian, mountain, club, hiking, during, the, early, twentieth, century, was, still, primarily, in, new, england, san, francisco, and, the, pacific, northwest, eventually, there, were, similar, clubs, formed, in, the, midwest, and, following, the, appalachian, range, as, interest, grew, hiking, culture, was, spread, throughout, the, nation, the, scottish, born, american, naturalist, john, muir, 1838, 1914, was, another, important, early, advocate, of, the, preservation, of, wilderness, in, the, united, states, he, petitioned, the, u, s, congress, for, the, national, park, bill, that, was, passed, in, 1890, establishing, yosemite, and, sequoia, national, parks, the, sierra, club, which, he, founded, is, now, one, of, the, most, important, conservation, organizations, in, the, united, states, the, spiritual, quality, and, enthusiasm, toward, nature, expressed, in, his, writings, inspired, others, including, presidents, and, congressmen, to, take, action, to, help, preserve, large, areas, of, undeveloped, countryside, he, is,

chance, of, injury, instead, they, recommend, reducing, pack, weight, to, make, hiking, long, distances, easier, even, the, use, of, hiking, boots, on, long, distances, hikes, is, controversial, among, ultralight, hikers, because, of, their, weight, hiking, times, can, be, estimated, by, naismith, s, rule, or, tobler, s, hiking, function, while, distances, can, be, measured, on, a, map, with,

can, be, a, rewarding, experience, for, them, particularly, if, a, route, is, chosen, with, their, interests, in, mind, young, children, are, prone, to, becoming, fatigued, more, rapidly, than, adults, requiring, fluids, and, energy, rich, foods, more, frequently, and, are, also, more, sensitive, to, variations, in, weather, and, terrain, hiking, routes, may, be, chosen, with, these, factors, in, mind, and, appropriate, clothing, equipment, and, sun, protection, need, to, be, available, natural, environments, are, often, fragile, and, may, be, accidentally, damaged, especially, when, a, large, number, of, hikers, are, involved, for, example, years, of, gathering, wood, can, strip, an, alpine, area, of, valuable, nutrients, and, can, cause, deforestation, and, some, species, such, as, martens, or, bighorn, sheep, are, very, sensitive, to, the, presence, of, humans, especially, around, mating, season, generally, protected, areas, such, as, parks, have, regulations, in, place, to, protect, the, environment, so, as, to, minimize, such, impact, such, regulations, include, banning, wood, fires, restricting, camping, to, established, campsites, disposing, or, packing, out, faecal, matter, and, imposing, a, quota, on, the, number, of, hikers, many, hikers, espouse, the, philosophy, of, leave, no, trace, following, strict, practices, on, dealing, with, food, waste, food, packaging, and, other, impacts, on, the, environment, human, feces, are, often, a, major, source, of, environmental, impact, from, hiking, and, can, contaminate, the, watershed, and, make, other, hikers, ill, catholes, dug, 10, to, 25, cm, 4, to, 10, inches, deep, depending, on, local, soil, composition, and, covered, after, use, at, least, 60, m, 200, feet, away, from, water, sources,
