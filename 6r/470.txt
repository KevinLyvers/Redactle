table, tennis, also, known, as, ping, pong, or, whiff, whaff, is, a, racket, sport, derived, from, tennis, but, distinguished, by, its, playing, surface, being, atop, a, stationary, table, rather, than, the, court, on, which, players, stand, either, individually, or, in, teams, of, two, players, take, alternating, turns, returning, a, light, hollow, ball, over, the, table, s, net, onto, the, opposing, half, of, the, court, using, small, rackets, until, they, fail, to, do, so, which, results, in, a, point, for, the, opponent, play, is, fast, requiring, quick, reaction, and, constant, attention, and, is, characterized, by, an, emphasis, on, spin, which, can, affect, the, ball, s, trajectory, more, than, in, other, ball, sports, owed, to, its, small, minimum, playing, area, its, ability, to, be, played, indoors, in, all, climates, and, relative, accessibility, of, equipment, table, tennis, is, enjoyed, worldwide, not, just, as, a, competitive, sport, but, as, a, common, recreational, pastime, among, players, of, all, levels, and, ages, table, tennis, has, been, an, olympic, sport, since, 1988, with, event, categories, in, both, men, s, and, women, s, singles, and,

official, rules, in, the, ittf, handbook, ittf, currently, includes, 226, member, associations, worldwide, the, sport, originated, in, victorian, england, where, it, was, played, among, the, upper, class, as, an, after, dinner, parlour, game, it, has, been, suggested, that, makeshift, versions, of, the, game, were, developed, by, british, military, officers, in, india, around, the, 1860s, or, 1870s, who, brought, it, back, with, them, a, row, of, books, stood, up, along, the, center, of, the, table, as, a, net, two, more, books, served, as, rackets, and, were, used, to, continuously, hit, a, golf, ball, in, 1883, british, sporting, goods, company, slazenger, filed, a, patent, for, a, net, for, table, tennis, the, name, ping, pong, was, in, wide, use, before, british, manufacturer, j, jaques, son, ltd, trademarked, it, in, 1901, the, name, ping, pong, then, came, to, describe, the, game, played, using, the, rather, expensive, jaques, s, equipment, with, other, manufacturers, calling, it, table, tennis, a, similar, situation, arose, in, the, united, states, where, jaques, sold, the, rights, to, the, ping, pong, name, to, parker, brothers, parker, brothers, then, enforced, its, trademark, for, the, term, in, the, 1920s, making, the, various, associations, change, their, names, to, table, tennis, instead, of, the, more, common, but, trademarked, term, the, u, s, trademark, for, ping, pong, is, currently, owned, by, indian, industries, inc, d, b, a, escalade, sports, the, next, major, innovation, was, by, james, w, gibb, a, british, table, tennis, enthusiast, who, discovered, novelty, celluloid, balls, on, a, trip, to, the, us, in, 1901, and, found, them, ideal, for, the, game, this, was, followed, by, e, c, goode, who, in, 1901, invented, the, modern, version, of, the, racket, by, fixing, a, sheet, of, pimpled, or, stippled, rubber, to, the, wooden, blade, table, tennis, was, growing, in, popularity, by, 1901, to, the, extent, that, tournaments, were, being, organized, books, were, being, written, on, the, subject, and, an, unofficial, world, championship, was, held, in, 1902, in, those, early, days, the, scoring, system, was, the, same, as, in, lawn, tennis, although, both, a, table, tennis, association, and, a, ping, pong, association, existed, by, 1910, a, new, table, tennis, association, was, founded, in, 1921, and, renamed, the, english, table, tennis, association, in, 1926, the, international, table, tennis, federation, ittf, followed, in, 1926, london, hosted, the, first, official, world, championships, in, 1926, in, 1933,

the, chinese, civil, war, had, a, passion, for, the, english, game, of, table, tennis, which, he, found, bizarre, on, the, other, hand, the, popularity, of, the, sport, waned, in, the, 1930s, soviet, union, partly, because, of, the, promotion, of, team, and, military, sports, and, partly, because, of, a, theory, that, the, game, had, adverse, health, effects, in, the, 1950s, paddles, that, used, a, rubber, sheet, combined, with, an, underlying, sponge, layer, changed, the, game, dramatically, introducing, greater, spin, and, speed, these, were, introduced, to, britain, by, sports, goods, manufacturer, s, w, hancock, ltd, the, use, of, speed, glue, beginning, in, the, mid, 1980s, increased, the, spin, and, speed, even, further, resulting, in, changes, to, the, equipment, to, slow, the, game, down, table, tennis, was, introduced, as, an, olympic, sport, at, the, olympics, in, 1988, the, official, rules, and, regulations, are, specified, in, the, ittf, handbook, which, was, first, published, in, 1927, the, current, fiftieth, version, was, published, in, 2022, after, the, 2000, olympics, in, sydney, the, ittf, instituted, several, rule, changes, that, were, aimed, at, making, table, tennis, more, viable, as, a, televised, spectator, sport, first, the, older, 38, mm, 1, 50, in, balls, were, officially, replaced, by, 40, mm, 1, 57, in, balls, in, october, 2000, this, increased, the, ball, s, air, resistance, and, effectively, slowed, down, the, game, by, that, time, players, had, begun, increasing, the, thickness, of, the, fast, sponge, layer, on, their, paddles, which, made, the, game, excessively, fast, and, difficult, to, watch, on, television, a, few, months, later, the, ittf, changed, from, a, 21, point, to, an, 11, point, scoring, system, and, the, serve, rotation, was, reduced, from, five, points, to, two, effective, in, september, 2001, this, was, intended, to, make, games, more, fast, paced, and, exciting, the, ittf, also, changed, the, rules, on, service, to, prevent, a, player, from, hiding, the, ball, during, service, in, order, to, increase, the, average, length, of, rallies, and, to, reduce, the, server, s, advantage, effective, in, 2002, for, the, opponent, to, have, time, to, realize, a, serve, is, taking, place, the, ball, must, be, tossed, a, minimum, of, 16, centimetres, 6, 3, in, in, the, air, the, ittf, states, that,

or, orange, with, a, matte, finish, the, choice, of, ball, color, is, made, according, to, the, table, color, and, its, surroundings, for, example, a, white, ball, is, easier, to, see, on, a, green, or, blue, table, than, it, is, on, a, grey, table, manufacturers, often, indicate, the, quality, of, the, ball, with, a, star, rating, system, usually, from, one, to, three, three, being, the, highest, grade, as, this, system, is, not, standard, across, manufacturers, the, only, way, a, ball, may, be, used, in, official, competition, is, upon, ittf, approval, the, ittf, approval, can, be, seen, printed, on, the, ball, the, 40, mm, ball, was, introduced, after, the, end, of, the, 2000, summer, olympics, previously, a, 38, mm, ball, was, standard, this, created, some, controversies,

common, wood, types, include, balsa, limba, cypress, and, hinoki, which, is, popular, in, japan, the, average, size, of, the, blade, is, about, 17, centimetres, 6, 7, in, long, and, 15, centimetres, 5, 9, in, wide, although, the, official, restrictions, only, focus, on, the, flatness, and, rigidity, of, the, blade, itself, these, dimensions, are, optimal, for, most, play, styles, table, tennis, regulations, allow, different, rubber, surfaces, on, each, side, of, the, racket, various, types, of, surfaces, provide, various, levels, of, spin, or, speed, and, in, some, cases, they, nullify, spin, for, example, a, player, may, have, a, rubber, that, provides, much, spin, on, one, side, of, their, racket, and, one, that, provides, no, spin, on, the, other, by, flipping, the, racket, in, play, different, types, of, returns, are, possible, to, help, a, player, distinguish, between, the, rubber, used, by, his, opposing, player, international, rules, specify, that, one, side, must, be,

racket, before, a, match, to, see, the, type, of, rubber, used, and, what, color, it, is, despite, high, speed, play, and, rapid, exchanges, a, player, can, see, clearly, what, side, of, the, racket, was, used, to, hit, the, ball, current, rules, state, that, unless, damaged, in, play, the, racket, cannot, be, exchanged, for, another, racket, at, any, time, during, a, match, according, to, ittf, rule, 2, 13, 1, the, first, service, is, decided, by, lot, normally, a, coin, toss, it, is, also, common, for, one, player, or, the, umpire, scorer, to, hide, the, ball, in, one, or, the, other, hand, usually, hidden, under, the, table, allowing, the, other, player, to, guess, which, hand, the, ball, is, in, the, correct, or, incorrect, guess, gives, the, winner, the, option, to, choose, to, serve, receive, or, to, choose, which, side, of, the, table, to, use, a, common, but, non, sanctioned, method, is, for, the, players, to, play, the, ball, back, and, forth, three, times, and, then, play, out, the, point, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, serve, to, play, rally, to, serve, play, for, serve, or, volley, for, serve, another, common, method, is, referred, to, as, ping, for, serve, or, pinging, for, serve, where, players, will, begin, playing, by, hitting, or, bouncing, the, ball, and, playing, a, rally, spelling, out, the, word, ping, p, i, n, g, with, each, hit, then, playing, out, the, point, for, service, in, game, play, the, player, serving, the, ball, commences, a, play, the, server, first, stands, with, the, ball, held, on, the, open, palm, of, the, hand, not, carrying, the, paddle, called, the, freehand, and, tosses, the, ball, directly, upward, without, spin, at, least, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, high, the, server, strikes, the, ball, with, the, racket, on, the, ball, s, descent, so, that, it, first, touches, the, server, s, court, and, then, touches, directly, the, receiver, s, court, without, touching, the, net, assembly, in, casual, games, many, players, do, not, toss, the, ball, upward, however, this, is, technically, illegal, and, can, give, the, serving, player, an, unfair, advantage, the, ball, must, remain, behind, the, endline, and, above, the, playing, surface, of, the, table, at, all, times, during, the, service, the, server, s, body, or, clothing, cannot, be, used, to, obstruct, sight, of, the, ball, the, opponent, and, the, umpire, must, have, a, clear, view, of, the, ball, at, all, times, if, the, umpire, is, doubtful, of, the, legality, of, a, service, they, may, first, interrupt, play, and, give, a, warning, to, the, server, if, the, serve, is, a, clear, failure, or, is, doubted, again, by, the, umpire, after, the, warning, the, receiver, scores, a, point, if, the, service, is, good, then, the, receiver, must, make, a, good, return, by, hitting, the, ball, back, before, it, bounces, a, second, time, on, receiver, s, side, of, the, table, so, that, the, ball, passes, the, net, and, touches, the, opponent, s, court, either, directly, or, after, touching, the, net, assembly, thereafter, the, server, and, receiver, must, alternately, make, a, return, until, the, rally, is, over, returning, the, serve, is, one, of, the, most, difficult, parts, of, the, game, as, the, server, s, first, move, is, often, the, least, predictable, and, thus, most, advantageous, shot, due, to, the, numerous, spin, and, speed, choices, at, the, server, s, disposal, a, let, is, a, rally, of, which, the, result, is, not, scored, and, is, called, in, the, following, circumstances, a, let, is, also, called, foul, service, if, the, ball, hits, the, server, s, side, of, the, table, if, the, ball, does, not, pass, further, than, the, edge, and, if, the, ball, hits, the, table, edge, and, hits, the, net, a, point, is, scored, by, the, player, for, any, of, several, results, of, the, rally, a, game, shall, be, won, by, the, player, first, scoring, 11, points, unless, both, players, score, 10, points, when, the, game, shall, be, won, by, the, first, player, subsequently, gaining, a, lead, of, 2, points, a, match, shall, consist, of, the, best, of, any, odd, number, of, games, in, competition, play, matches, are, typically, best, of, five, or, seven, games, service, alternates, between, opponents, every, two, points, regardless, of, winner, of, the, rally, until, the, end, of, the, game, unless, both, players, score, ten, points, or, the, expedite, system, is, operated, when, the, sequences, of, serving, and, receiving, stay, the, same, but, each, player, serves, for, only, one, point, in, turn, deuce, the, player, serving, first, in, a, game, receives, first, in, the, next, game, of, the, match, after, each, game, players, switch, sides, of, the, table, in, the, last, possible, game, of, a, match, for, example, the, seventh, game, in, a, best, of, seven, match, players, change, ends, when, the, first, player, scores, five, points, regardless, of, whose, turn, it, is, to, serve, if, the, sequence, of, serving, and, receiving, is, out, of, turn, or, the, ends, are, not, changed, points, scored, in, the, wrong, situation, are, still, calculated, and, the, game, shall, be, resumed, with, the, order, at, the, score, that, has, been, reached, in, addition, to, games, between, individual, players, pairs, may, also, play, table, tennis, singles, and, doubles, are, both, played, in, international, competition, including, the, olympic, games, since, 1988, and, the, commonwealth, games, since, 2002, in, doubles, all, the, rules, of, single, play, are, applied, except, for, the, following, service, order, of, play, serving, and, receiving, if, a, game, is, unfinished, after, 10, minutes, of, play, and, fewer, than, 18, points, have, been, scored, the, expedite, system, is, initiated, the, umpire, interrupts, the, game, and, the, game, resumes, with, players, serving, for, one, point, in, turn, if, the, expedite, system, is, introduced, while, the, ball, is, not, in, play, the, previous, receiver, shall, serve, first, under, the, expedite, system, the, server, must, win, the, point, before, the, opponent, makes, 13, consecutive, returns, or, the, point, goes, to, the, opponent, the, system, can, also, be, initiated, at, any, time, at, the, request, of, both, players, or, pairs, once, introduced, the, expedite, system, remains, in, force, until, the, end, of, the, match, as, it, is, intended, as, a, rule, to, shorten, the, duration, of, a, match, it, is, mainly, deployed, in, defensive, players, matches, which, tend, to, have, longer, points, though, table, tennis, players, grip, their, rackets, in, various, ways, their, grips, can, be, classified, into, two, major, families, of, styles, penhold, and, shakehand, the, rules, of, table, tennis, do, not, prescribe, the, manner, in, which, one, must, grip, the, racket, and, numerous, grips, are, employed, the, penhold, grip, is, so, named, because, one, grips, the, racket, similarly, to, the, way, one, holds, a, writing, instrument, the, style, of, play, among, penhold, players, can, vary, greatly, from, player, to, player, the, most, popular, style, usually, referred, to, as, the, chinese, penhold, style, involves, curling, the, middle, ring, and, fourth, finger, on, the, back, of, the, blade, with, the, three, fingers, always, touching, one, another, chinese, penholders, favour, a, round, racket, head, for, a, more, over, the, table, style, of, play, in, contrast, another, style, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, japanese, korean, penhold, grip, involves, splaying, those, three, fingers, out, across, the, back, of, the, racket, usually, with, all, three, fingers, touching, the, back, of, the, racket, rather, than, stacked, upon, one, another, sometimes, a, combination, of, the, two, styles, occurs, wherein, the, middle, ring, and, fourth, fingers, are, straight, but, still, stacked, or, where, all, fingers, may, be, touching, the, back, of, the, racket, but, are, also, in, contact, with, one, another, japanese, and, korean, penholders, will, often, use, a, square, headed, racket, for, an, away, from, the, table, style, of, play, traditionally, these, square, headed, rackets, feature, a, block, of, cork, on, top, of, the, handle, as, well, as, a, thin, layer, of, cork, on, the, back, of, the, racket, for, increased, grip, and, comfort, penhold, styles, are, popular, among, players, originating, from, east, asian, countries, such, as, china, japan, south, korea, and, taiwan, traditionally, penhold, players, use, only, one, side, of, the, racket, to, hit, the, ball, during, normal, play, and, the, side, which, is, in, contact, with, the, last, three, fingers, is, generally, not, used, this, configuration, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, traditional, penhold, and, is, more, commonly, found, in, square, headed, racket, styles, however, the, chinese, developed, a, technique, in, the, 1990s, in, which, a, penholder, uses, both, sides, of, the, racket, to, hit, the, ball, where, the, player, produces, a, backhand, stroke, most, often, topspin, known, as, a, reverse, penhold, backhand, by, turning, the, traditional, side, of, the, racket, to, face, one, s, self, and, striking, the, ball, with, the, opposite, side, of, the, racket, this, stroke, has, greatly, improved, and, strengthened, the, penhold, style, both, physically, and, psychologically, as, it, eliminates, the, strategic, weakness, of, the, traditional, penhold, backhand, the, shakehand, grip, is, so, named, because, the, racket, is, grasped, as, if, one, is, performing, a, handshake, though, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, tennis, or, western, grip, it, bears, no, relation, to, the, western, tennis, grip, which, was, popularized, on, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, in, which, the, racket, is, rotated, 90, and, played, with, the, wrist, turned, so, that, on, impact, the, knuckles, face, the, target, in, table, tennis, western, refers, to, western, nations, for, this, is, the, grip, that, players, native, to, europe, and, the, americas, have, almost, exclusively, employed, the, shakehand, grip, s, simplicity, and, versatility, coupled, with, the, acceptance, among, top, level, chinese, trainers, that, the, european, style, of, play, should, be, emulated, and, trained, against, has, established, it, as, a, common, grip, even, in, china, many, world, class, european, and, east, asian, players, currently, use, the, shakehand, grip, and, it, is, generally, accepted, that, shakehands, is, easier, to, learn, than, penholder, allowing, a, broader, range, of, playing, styles, both, offensive, and, defensive, the, seemiller, grip, is, named, after, the, american, table, tennis, champion, danny, seemiller, who, used, it, it, is, achieved, by, placing, the, thumb, and, index, finger, on, either, side, of, the, bottom, of, the, racquet, head, and, holding, the, handle, with, the, rest, of, the, fingers, since, only, one, side, of, the, racquet, is, used, to, hit, the, ball, two, contrasting, rubber, types, can, be, applied, to, the, blade, offering, the, advantage, of, twiddling, the, racket, to, fool, the, opponent, seemiller, paired, inverted, rubber, with, anti, spin, rubber, many, players, today, combine, inverted, and, long, pipped, rubber, the, grip, is, considered, exceptional, for, blocking, especially, on, the, backhand, side, and, for, forehand, loops, of, backspin, balls, the, seemiller, grip, s, popularity, reached, its, apex, in, 1985, when, four, danny, seemiller, ricky, seemiller, eric, boggan, and, brian, masters, of, the, united, states, five, participants, in, the, world, championships, used, it, a, good, ready, position, will, enable, you, to, move, quickly, into, position, and, to, stay, balanced, whilst, playing, powerful, strokes, the, stance, in, table, tennis, is, also, known, as, the, ready, position, it, is, the, position, every, player, initially, adopts, when, receiving, and, returns, to, after, playing, a, shot, in, order, to, be, prepared, to, make, the, next, shot, it, involves, the, feet, being, spaced, wider, than, shoulder, width, and, a, partial, crouch, being, adopted, the, crouch, is, an, efficient, posture, for, moving, quickly, from, and, also, preloads, the, muscles, enabling, a, more, dynamic, movement, the, upper, torso, is, positioned, slightly, forward, and, the, player, is, looking, forwards, the, racket, is, held, at, the, ready, with, a, bent, arm, the, position, should, feel, balanced, and, provide, a, solid, base, for, striking, and, quick, lateral, movement, players, may, tailor, their, stance, based, upon, their, personal, preferences, and, alter, it, during, the, game, based, upon, the, specific, circumstances, table, tennis, strokes, generally, break, down, into, offensive, and, defensive, categories, also, known, as, speed, drive, a, direct, hit, on, the, ball, propelling, it, forward, back, to, the, opponent, this, stroke, differs, from, speed, drives, in, other, racket, sports, like, tennis, because, the, racket, is, primarily, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, the, stroke, and, most, of, the, energy, applied, to, the, ball, results, in, speed, rather, than, spin, creating, a, shot, that, does, not, arc, much, but, is, fast, enough, that, it, can, be, difficult, to, return, a, speed, drive, is, used, mostly, for, keeping, the, ball, in, play, applying, pressure, on, the, opponent, and, potentially, opening, up, an, opportunity, for, a, more, powerful, attack, perfected, during, the, 1960s, the, loop, is, essentially, the, reverse, of, the, chop, the, racket, is, parallel, to, the, direction, of, the, stroke, closed, and, the, racket, thus, grazes, the, ball, resulting, in, a, large, amount, of, topspin, a, good, loop, drive, will, arc, quite, a, bit, and, once, striking, the, opponent, s, side, of, the, table, will, jump, forward, much, like, a, kick, serve, in, tennis, most, professional, players, nowadays, such, as, ding, ning, timo, boll, and, zhang, jike, primarily, use, loop, for, offense, the, counter, hit, is, usually, a, counterattack, against, drives, normally, high, loop, drives, the, racket, is, held, closed, and, near, to, the, ball, which, is, hit, with, a, short, movement, off, the, bounce, immediately, after, hitting, the, table, so, that, the, ball, travels, faster, to, the, other, side, kenta, matsudaira, is, known, for, primarily, using, counter, hit, for, offense, when, a, player, tries, to, attack, a, ball, that, has, not, bounced, beyond, the, edge, of, the, table, the, player, does, not, have, the, room, to, wind, up, in, a, backswing, the, ball, may, still, be, attacked, however, and, the, resulting, shot, is, called, a, flip, because, the, backswing, is, compressed, into, a, quick, wrist, action, a, flip, is, not, a, single, stroke, and, can, resemble, either, a, loop, drive, or, a, loop, in, its, characteristics, what, identifies, the, stroke, is, that, the, backswing, is, compressed, into, a, short, wrist, flick, a, player, will, typically, execute, a, smash, when, the, opponent, has, returned, a, ball, that, bounces, too, high, or, too, close, to, the, net, it, is, nearly, always, done, with, a, forehand, stroke, smashing, uses, rapid, acceleration, to, impart, as, much, speed, on, the, ball, as, possible, so, that, the, opponent, cannot, react, in, time, the, racket, is, generally, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, the, stroke, because, the, speed, is, the, main, aim, of, this, shot, the, spin, on, the, ball, is, often, minimal, although, it, can, be, applied, as, well, an, offensive, table, tennis, player, will, think, of, a, rally, as, a, build, up, to, a, winning, smash, smash, is, used, more, often, with, penhold, grip, the, push, or, slice, in, asia, is, usually, used, for, keeping, the, point, alive, and, creating, offensive, opportunities, a, push, resembles, a, tennis, slice, the, racket, cuts, underneath, the, ball, imparting, backspin, and, causing, the, ball, to, float, slowly, to, the, other, side, of, the, table, a, push, can, be, difficult, to, attack, because, the, backspin, on, the, ball, causes, it, to, drop, toward, the, table, upon, striking, the, opponent, s, racket, in, order, to, attack, a, push, a, player, must, usually, loop, if, the, push, is, long, or, flip, if, the, push, is, short, the, ball, back, over, the, net, often, the, best, option, for, beginners, is, to, simply, push, the, ball, back, again, resulting, in, pushing, rallies, against, good, players, it, may, be, the, worst, option, because, the, opponent, will, counter, with, a, loop, putting, the, first, player, in, a, defensive, position, pushing, can, have, advantages, in, some, circumstances, such, as, when, the, opponent, makes, easy, mistakes, a, chop, is, the, defensive, backspin, counterpart, to, the, offensive, loop, drive, a, chop, is, essentially, a, bigger, heavier, push, taken, well, back, from, the, table, the, racket, face, points, primarily, horizontally, perhaps, a, little, bit, upward, and, the, direction, of, the, stroke, is, straight, down, the, object, of, a, defensive, chop, is, to, match, the, topspin, of, the, opponent, s, shot, with, backspin, a, good, chop, will, float, nearly, horizontally, back, to, the, table, in, some, cases, having, so, much, backspin, that, the, ball, actually, rises, such, a, chop, can, be, extremely, difficult, to, return, due, to, its, enormous, amount, of, backspin, some, defensive, players, can, also, impart, no, spin, or, sidespin, variations, of, the, chop, some, famous, choppers, include, joo, sae, hyuk, and, wu, yang, a, block, is, executed, by, simply, placing, the, racket, in, front, of, the, ball, right, after, the, ball, bounces, thus, the, ball, rebounds, back, toward, the, opponent, with, nearly, as, much, energy, as, it, came, in, with, this, requires, precision, since, the, ball, s, spin, speed, and, location, all, influence, the, correct, angle, of, a, block, it, is, very, possible, for, an, opponent, to, execute, a, perfect, loop, drive, or, smash, only, to, have, the, blocked, shot, come, back, just, as, fast, due, to, the, power, involved, in, offensive, strokes, often, an, opponent, simply, cannot, recover, quickly, enough, to, return, the, blocked, shot, especially, if, the, block, is, aimed, at, an, unexpected, side, of, the, table, blocks, almost, always, produce, the, same, spin, as, was, received, many, times, topspin, the, defensive, lob, propels, the, ball, about, five, metres, in, height, only, to, land, on, the, opponent, s, side, of, the, table, with, great, amounts, of, spin, the, stroke, itself, consists, of, lifting, the, ball, to, an, enormous, height, before, it, falls, back, to, the, opponent, s, side, of, the, table, a, lob, can, have, nearly, any, kind, of, spin, though, the, opponent, may, smash, the, ball, hard, and, fast, a, good, defensive, lob, could, be, more, difficult, to, return, due, to, the, unpredictability, and, heavy, amounts, of, the, spin, on, the, ball, thus, though, backed, off, the, table, by, tens, of, feet, and, running, to, reach, the, ball, a, good, defensive, player, can, still, win, the, point, using, good, lobs, the, lob, is, used, less, frequently, by, professional, players, a, notable, exception, is, michael, maze, adding, spin, onto, the, ball, causes, major, changes, in, table, tennis, gameplay, although, nearly, every, stroke, or, serve, creates, some, kind, of, spin, understanding, the, individual, types, of, spin, allows, players, to, defend, against, and, use, different, spins, effectively, backspin, is, where, the, bottom, half, of, the, ball, is, rotating, away, from, the, player, and, is, imparted, by, striking, the, base, of, the, ball, with, a, downward, movement, at, the, professional, level, backspin, is, usually, used, defensively, in, order, to, keep, the, ball, low, backspin, is, commonly, employed, in, service, because, it, is, harder, to, produce, an, offensive, return, though, at, the, professional, level, most, people, serve, sidespin, with, either, backspin, or, topspin, due, to, the, initial, lift, of, the, ball, there, is, a, limit, on, how, much, speed, with, which, one, can, hit, the, ball, without, missing, the, opponent, s, side, of, the, table, however, backspin, also, makes, it, harder, for, the, opponent, to, return, the, ball, with, great, speed, because, of, the, required, angular, precision, of, the, return, alterations, are, frequently, made, to, regulations, regarding, equipment, in, an, effort, to, maintain, a, balance, between, defensive, and, offensive, spin, choices, it, is, actually, possible, to, smash, with, backspin, offensively, but, only, on, high, balls, that, are, close, to, the, net, the, topspin, stroke, has, a, smaller, influence, on, the, first, part, of, the, ball, curve, like, the, backspin, stroke, however, the, axis, of, spin, remains, roughly, perpendicular, to, the, trajectory, of, the, ball, thus, allowing, for, the, magnus, effect, to, dictate, the, subsequent, curvature, after, the, apex, of, the, curve, the, ball, dips, downwards, as, it, approaches, the, opposing, side, before, bouncing, on, the, bounce, the, topspin, will, accelerate, the, ball, much, in, the, same, way, that, a, wheel, which, is, already, spinning, would, accelerate, upon, making, contact, with, the, ground, when, the, opponent, attempts, to, return, the, ball, the, topspin, causes, the, ball, to, jump, upwards, and, the, opponent, is, forced, to, compensate, for, the, topspin, by, adjusting, the, angle, of, his, or, her, racket, this, is, known, as, closing, the, racket, the, speed, limitation, of, the, topspin, stroke, is, minor, compared, to, the, backspin, stroke, this, stroke, is, the, predominant, technique, used, in, professional, competition, because, it, gives, the, opponent, less, time, to, respond, in, table, tennis, topspin, is, regarded, as, an, offensive, technique, due, to, increased, ball, speed, lower, bio, mechanical, efficiency, and, the, pressure, that, it, puts, on, the, opponent, by, reducing, reaction, time, it, is, possible, to, play, defensive, topspin, lobs, from, far, behind, the, table, but, only, highly, skilled, players, use, this, stroke, with, any, tactical, efficiency, topspin, is, the, least, common, type, of, spin, to, be, found, in, service, at, the, professional, level, simply, because, it, is, much, easier, to, attack, a, top, spin, ball, that, is, not, moving, at, high, speed, this, type, of, spin, is, predominantly, employed, during, service, wherein, the, contact, angle, of, the, racket, can, be, more, easily, varied, unlike, the, two, aforementioned, techniques, sidespin, causes, the, ball, to, spin, on, an, axis, which, is, vertical, rather, than, horizontal, the, axis, of, rotation, is, still, roughly, perpendicular, to, the, trajectory, of, the, ball, in, this, circumstance, the, magnus, effect, will, still, dictate, the, curvature, of, the, ball, to, some, degree, another, difference, is, that, unlike, backspin, and, topspin, sidespin, will, have, relatively, very, little, effect, on, the, bounce, of, the, ball, much, in, the, same, way, that, a, spinning, top, would, not, travel, left, or, right, if, its, axis, of, rotation, were, exactly, vertical, this, makes, sidespin, a, useful, weapon, in, service, because, it, is, less, easily, recognized, when, bouncing, and, the, ball, loses, less, spin, on, the, bounce, sidespin, can, also, be, employed, in, offensive, rally, strokes, often, from, a, greater, distance, as, an, adjunct, to, topspin, or, backspin, this, stroke, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, hook, the, hook, can, even, be, used, in, some, extreme, cases, to, circumvent, the, net, when, away, from, the, table, players, employ, this, type, of, spin, almost, exclusively, when, serving, but, at, the, professional, level, it, is, also, used, from, time, to, time, in, the, lob, unlike, any, of, the, techniques, mentioned, above, corkspin, or, drill, spin, has, the, axis, of, spin, relatively, parallel, to, the, ball, s, trajectory, so, that, the, magnus, effect, has, little, or, no, effect, on, the, trajectory, of, a, cork, spun, ball, upon, bouncing, the, ball, will, dart, right, or, left, according, to, the, direction, of, the, spin, severely, complicating, the, return, in, theory, this, type, of, spin, produces, the, most, obnoxious, effects, but, it, is, less, strategically, practical, than, sidespin, or, backspin, because, of, the, limitations, that, it, imposes, upon, the, opponent, during, their, return, aside, from, the, initial, direction, change, when, bouncing, unless, it, goes, out, of, reach, the, opponent, can, counter, with, either, topspin, or, backspin, a, backspin, stroke, is, similar, in, the, fact, that, the, corkspin, stroke, has, a, lower, maximum, velocity, simply, due, to, the, contact, angle, of, the, racket, when, producing, the, stroke, to, impart, a, spin, on, the, ball, which, is, parallel, to, its, trajectory, the, racket, must, be, swung, more, or, less, perpendicular, to, the, trajectory, of, the, ball, greatly, limiting, the, forward, momentum, that, the, racket, transfers, to, the, ball, corkspin, is, almost, always, mixed, with, another, variety, of, spin, since, alone, it, is, not, only, less, effective, but, also, harder, to, produce, competitive, table, tennis, is, popular, in, east, asia, and, europe, and, has, been, gaining, attention, in, the, united, states, the, most, important, international, competitions, are, the,
