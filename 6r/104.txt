healthful, than, red, meat, with, lower, concentrations, of, cholesterol, and, saturated, fat, the, poultry, farming, industry, that, accounts, for, chicken, production, takes, on, a, range, of, forms, across, different, parts, of, the, world, in, developed, countries, chickens, are, typically, subject, to, intensive, farming, methods, while, less, developed, areas, raise, chickens, using, more, traditional, farming, techniques, the, united, nations, estimates, there, to, be, 19, billion, chickens, on, earth, in, 2011, making, them, outnumber, humans, more, than, two, to, one, the, modern, chicken, is, a, descendant, of, red, junglefowl, hybrids, along, with, the, grey, junglefowl, first, raised, thousands, of, years, ago, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, chicken, as, a, meat, has, been, depicted, in, babylonian, carvings, from, around, 600, bc, chicken, was, one, of, the, most, common, meats, available, in, the, middle, ages, for, thousands, of, years, a, number, of, different, kinds, of, chicken, have, been, eaten, across, most, of, the, eastern, hemisphere, including, capons, pullets, and, hens, it, was, one, of, the, basic, ingredients,

expensive, than, other, meats, and, it, was, sought, by, the, rich, because, so, costly, as, to, be, an, uncommon, dish, chicken, consumption, in, the, u, s, increased, during, world, war, ii, due, to, a, shortage, of, beef, and, pork, in, europe, consumption, of, chicken, overtook, that, of, beef, and, veal, in, 1996, linked, to, consumer, awareness, of, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, mad, cow, disease, 357, million, tonnes, of, meat, were, produced, in, 2021, 53, more, than, in, 2000, with, chicken, meat, representing, more, than, half, the, increase, chicken, meat, was, the, most, produced, type, of, meat, in, 2021, just, ahead, of, pig, meat, modern, varieties, of, chicken, such, as, the, cornish, cross, are, bred, specifically, for, meat, production, with, an, emphasis, placed, on, the, ratio, of, feed, to, meat, produced, by, the, animal, the, most, common, breeds, of, chicken, consumed, in, the, u, s, are, cornish, and, white, rock, chickens, raised, specifically, for, food, are, called, broilers, in, the, u, s, broilers, are, typically, butchered, at, a, young, age, modern, cornish, cross, hybrids, for, example, are, butchered, as, early, as, 8, weeks, for, fryers, and, 12, weeks, for, roasting, birds, capons, castrated, cocks, produce, more, and, fattier, meat, for, this, reason, they, are, considered, a, delicacy, and, were, particularly, popular, in, the, middle, ages, chicken, meat, contains, about, two, to, three, times, as, much, polyunsaturated, fat, as, most, types, of, red, meat, when, measured, as, weight, percentage, chicken, generally, includes, low, fat, in, the, meat, itself, castrated, roosters, excluded, the, fat, is, highly, concentrated, on, the, skin, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, of, raw, chicken, breast, contains, 2, grams, 0, 071, oz, of, fat, and, 22, grams, 0, 78, oz, of, protein, compared, to, 9, grams, 0, 32, oz, of, fat, and, 20, grams, 0, 71, oz, of, protein, for, the, same, portion, of, raw, beef, flank, steak, in, factory, farming, chickens, are, routinely, administered, with, the, feed, additive, roxarsone, an, organoarsenic, compound, which, partially, decomposes, into, inorganic, arsenic, compounded, in, the, flesh, of, chickens, and, in, their, feces, which, are, often, used, as, a, fertilizer, the, compound, is, used, to, control, stomach, pathogens, and, promote, growth, in, a, 2013, sample, conducted, by, the, johns, hopkins, school, of, public, health, of, chicken, meat, from, poultry, producers, that, did, not, prohibit, roxarsone, 70, of, the, samples, in, the, us, had, levels, which, exceeded, the, safety, limits, as, set, by, the, fda, the, fda, has, since, revised, its, stance, on, safe, limits, to, inorganic, arsenic, in, animal, feed, by, stating, that, any, new, animal, drug, that, contributes, to, the, overall, inorganic, arsenic, burden, is, of, potential, concern, the, fda, approval, for, roxarsone, and, two, other, arsenic, poultry, drugs, were, voluntarily, withdrawn, by, the, manufacturers, in, september, 2013, the, final, remaining, arsenic, drug, nitarsone, was, banned, at, the, end, of, 2015, information, obtained, by, the, canadian, integrated, program, for, antimicrobial, resistance, cipars, strongly, indicates, that, cephalosporin, resistance, in, humans, is, moving, in, lockstep, with, the, use, of, the, drug, in, poultry, production, according, to, the, canadian, medical, association, journal, the, unapproved, antibiotic, ceftiofur, is, routinely, injected, into, eggs, in, quebec, and, ontario, to, discourage, infection, of, hatchlings, although, the, data, are, contested, by, the, industry, antibiotic, resistance, in, humans, appears, to, be, directly, related, to, the, antibiotic, s, use, in, eggs, a, study, by, the, translational, genomics, research, institute, showed, that, nearly, half, 47, of, the, meat, and, poultry, in, us, grocery, stores, was, contaminated, with, s, aureus, with, more, than, half, 52, of, those, bacteria, resistant, to, antibiotics, furthermore, as, per, the, fda, more, than, 25, of, retail, chicken, is, resistant, to, 5, or, more, different, classes, of, antibiotic, treatment, drugs, in, the, united, states, an, estimated, 90, 100, of, conventional, chicken, contains, at, least, one, form, of, antibiotic, resistance, microorganism, while, organic, chicken, has, been, found, to, have, a, lower, incidence, at, 84, in, random, surveys, of, chicken, products, across, the, united, states, in, 2012, the, physicians, committee, for, responsible, medicine, found, 48, of, samples, to, contain, fecal, matter, on, most, commercial, chicken, farms, the, chickens, spend, their, entire, life, standing, in, lying, on, and, living, in, their, own, manure, which, is, somewhat, mixed, in, with, the, bedding, material, e, g, sawdust, wood, shavings, chopped, straw, etc, during, shipping, from, the, concentrated, animal, feeding, operation, farm, to, the, abattoir, the, chickens, are, usually, placed, inside, shipping, crates, that, usually, have, slatted, floors, those, crates, are, then, piled, 5, to, 10, rows, high, on, the, transport, truck, to, the, abattoir, during, shipment, the, chickens, tend, to, defecate, and, that, chicken, manure, tends, to, sit, inside, the, crowded, cages, contaminating, the, feathers, and, skin, of, the, chickens, or, rains, down, upon, the, chickens, and, crates, on, the, lower, levels, of, the, transport, truck, by, the, time, the, truck, gets, to, the, abattoir, most, chickens, have, had, their, skin, and, feathers, contaminated, with, feces, there, is, also, fecal, matter, in, the, intestines, while, the, slaughter, process, removes, the, feathers, and, intestines, only, visible, fecal, matter, is, removed, the, high, speed, automated, processes, at, the, abattoir, are, not, designed, to, remove, this, fecal, contamination, on, the, feather, and, skin, the, high, speed, processing, equipment, tend, to, spray, the, contamination, around, to, the, birds, going, down, the, processing, line, and, the, equipment, on, the, line, itself, at, one, or, more, points, on, most, abattoirs, chemical, sprays, and, baths, e, g, bleach, acids, peroxides, etc, are, used, to, partially, rinse, off, or, kill, this, bacterial, contamination, the, fecal, contamination, once, it, has, occurred, especially, in, the, various, membranes, between, the, skin, and, muscle, is, impossible, to, completely, remove, chicken, is, sold, both, as, whole, birds, and, broken, down, into, pieces, in, the, united, kingdom, juvenile, chickens, of, less, than, 28, days, of, age, at, slaughter, are, marketed, as, poussin, mature, chicken, is, sold, as, small, medium, or, large, in, the, united, states, whole, mature, chickens, are, marketed, as, fryers, broilers, and, roasters, fryers, are, the, smallest, size, 2, 5, 4, lbs, dressed, for, sale, and, the, most, common, as, chicken, reach, this, size, quickly, about, 7, weeks, broilers, are, larger, than, fryers, roasters, or, roasting, hens, are, the, largest, chickens, commonly, sold, 3, 5, months, and, 6, 8, lbs, and, are, typically, more, expensive, even, larger, and, older, chickens, are, called, stewing, chickens, but, these, are, no, longer, usually, found, commercially, the, names, reflect, the, most, appropriate, cooking, method, for, the, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, as, the, size, increases, the, volume, which, determines, how, much, heat, must, enter, the, bird, for, it, to, be, cooked, increases, faster, than, the, surface, area, which, determines, how, fast, heat, can, enter, the, bird, for, a, fast, method, of, cooking, such, as, frying, a, small, bird, is, appropriate, frying, a, large, piece, of, chicken, results, in, the, inside, being, undercooked, when, the, outside, is, ready, chicken, is, also, sold, broken, down, into, pieces, such, pieces, usually, come, from, smaller, birds, that, would, qualify, as, fryers, if, sold, whole, pieces, may, include, quarters, or, fourths, of, the, chicken, a, chicken, is, typically, cut, into, two, leg, quarters, and, two, breast, quarters, each, quarter, contains, two, of, the,

other, parts, of, the, chicken, such, as, the, neck, feet, combs, etc, are, not, widely, available, except, in, countries, where, they, are, in, demand, or, in, cities, that, cater, to, ethnic, groups, who, favor, these, parts, worldwide, there, are, many, fast, food, restaurant, chains, that, sell, exclusively, or, primarily, poultry, products, including, kfc, global, red, rooster, australia, hector, chicken, belgium, and, cfc, indonesia, most, of, the, products, on, the, menus, in, such, eateries, are, fried, or, breaded, and, are, served, with, french, fries, raw, chicken, may, contain, salmonella, the, safe, minimum, cooking, temperature, recommended, by, the, u, s, department, of, health, human, services, is, 165, f, 74, c, to, prevent, foodborne, illness, because, of, bacteria, and, parasites, however, in, japan, raw, chicken, is, sometimes, consumed, in, a, dish, called, torisashi, which, is, sliced, raw, chicken, served, in, sashimi, style, another, preparation, is, toriwasa, which, is, lightly, seared, on, the, outsides, while, the, inside, remains, raw, chicken, can, be, cooked, in, many, ways, it, can, be, made, into, sausages, skewered, put,

breast, meat, is, often, sliced, thinly, and, marketed, as, chicken, slices, an, easy, filling, for, sandwiches, often, the, tenderloin, pectoralis, minor, is, marketed, separately, from, the, breast, pectoralis, major, in, the, us, tenders, can, be, either, tenderloins, or, strips, cut, from, the, breast, in, the, uk, the, strips, of, pectoralis, minor, are, called, chicken, mini, fillets, chicken, bones, are, hazardous, to, health, as, they, tend, to, break, into, sharp, splinters, when, eaten, but, they, can, be, simmered, with, vegetables, and, herbs, for, hours, or, even, days, to, make, chicken, stock, in, asian, countries, it, is, possible, to, buy, bones, alone, as, they, are, very, popular, for, making, chicken, soups, which, are, said, to, be, healthy, in, australia, the,

carcasses, and, are, purchased, for, soup, or, stock, purposes, raw, chicken, maintains, its, quality, longer, than, fresh, in, the, freezer, as, moisture, is, lost, during, cooking, there, is, little, change, in, nutrient, value, of, chicken, during, freezer, storage, for, optimal, quality, however, a, maximum, storage, time, in, the, freezer, of, 12, months, is, recommended, for, uncooked, whole, chicken, 9, months, for, uncooked, chicken, parts, 3, to, 4, months, for, uncooked, chicken, giblets, and, 4, months, for, cooked, chicken, freezing, does, not, usually, cause, color, changes, in, poultry, but, the, bones, and, the, meat, near, them, can, become, dark, this, bone, darkening, results, when, pigment, seeps, through, the, porous, bones, of, young, poultry, into, the, surrounding, tissues, when, the, poultry, meat, is, frozen, and, thawed, it, is, safe, to, freeze, chicken, directly, in, its, original, packaging, but, this, type, of, wrap, is, permeable, to, air, and, quality, may, diminish, over, time, therefore, for, prolonged, storage, it, is, recommended, to, overwrap, these, packages, it, is, recommended, to, freeze, unopened, vacuum, packages, as, is, if, a, package, has, accidentally, been, torn, or, has, opened, while, food, is, in, the, freezer, the, food, is, still, safe, to, use, but, it, is, still, recommended, to, overwrap, or, rewrap, it, chicken, should, be, away, from, other, foods, so, if, they, begin, to, thaw, their, juices, will, not, drip, onto, other, foods, if, previously, frozen, chicken, is, purchased, at, a, retail, store, it, can, be, refrozen, if, it, has, been, handled, properly, bacteria, survives, but, does, not, grow, in, freezing, temperatures, however, if, frozen, cooked, foods, are, not, defrosted, properly, and, are, not, reheated, to, temperatures, that, kill, bacteria, chances, of, getting, a, foodborne, illness, greatly, increase, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, free, content, work,
