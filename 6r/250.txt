https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent
the, age, of, consent, is, the, age, at, which, a, person, is, considered, to, be, legally, competent, to, consent, to, sexual, acts, consequently, an, adult, who, engages, in, sexual, activity, with, a, person, younger, than, the, age, of, consent, is, unable, to, legally, claim, that, the, sexual, activity, was, consensual, and, such, sexual, activity, may, be, considered, child, sexual, abuse, or, statutory, rape, the, person, below, the, minimum, age, is, considered, the, victim, and, their, sex, partner, the, offender, although, some, jurisdictions, provide, exceptions, through, romeo, and, juliet, laws, if, one, or, both, participants, are, underage, and, are, close, in, age, the, term, age, of, consent, typically, does, not, appear, in, legal, statutes, 1, 2, generally, a, law, will, establish, the, age, below, which, it, is, illegal, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, with, that, person, it, has, sometimes, been, used, with, other, meanings, such, as, the, age, at, which, a, person, becomes, competent, to, consent, to, marriage, but, consent, to, sexual, activity, is, the, meaning, now, generally, understood, it, should, not, be, confused, with, other, laws, regarding, age, minimums, including, but, not, limited, to, the, age, of, majority, age, of, criminal, responsibility, voting, age, drinking, age, and, driving, age, age, of, consent, laws, vary, widely, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, though, most, jurisdictions, set, the, age, of, consent, within, the, range, of, 14, to, 18, with, the, exceptions, of, argentina, niger, and, western, sahara, which, set, the, age, of, consent, at, 13, mexico, which, sets, the, age, of, consent, between, 12, and, 18, and, 14, muslim, states, which, set, the, consent, by, marriage, only, the, laws, may, also, vary, by, the, type, of, sexual, act, the, gender, of, the, participants, or, other, considerations, such, as, involving, a, position, of, trust, some, jurisdictions, may, also, make, allowances, for, minors, engaged, in, sexual, acts, with, each, other, rather, than, a, single, age, charges, and, penalties, resulting, from, a, breach, of, these, laws, may, range, from, a, misdemeanor, such, as, corruption, of, a, minor, to, what, is, popularly, called, statutory, rape, there, are, many, grey, areas, in, this, area, of, law, some, regarding, unspecific, and, untried, legislation, others, brought, about, by, debates, regarding, changing, societal, attitudes, and, others, due, to, conflicts, between, federal, and, state, laws, these, factors, all, make, age, of, consent, an, often, confusing, subject, and, a, topic, of, highly, charged, debates, in, traditional, societies, the, age, of, consent, for, a, sexual, union, was, a, matter, for, the, family, to, decide, or, a, tribal, custom, in, most, cases, this, coincided, with, signs, of, puberty, menstruation, for, a, woman, and, pubic, hair, for, a, man, reliable, data, for, ages, at, marriage, is, scarce, in, england, for, example, the, only, reliable, data, in, the, early, modern, period, comes, from, property, records, made, after, death, not, only, were, the, records, relatively, rare, but, not, all, bothered, to, record, the, participants, ages, and, it, seems, that, the, more, complete, the, records, are, the, more, likely, they, are, to, reveal, young, marriages, modern, historians, have, sometimes, shown, reluctance, to, accept, evidence, of, young, ages, of, marriage, dismissing, it, as, a, misreading, by, a, later, copier, of, the, records, in, the, 12th, century, gratian, the, influential, compiler, of, canon, law, in, medieval, europe, accepted, the, age, of, puberty, for, marriage, to, be, around, twelve, for, girls, and, around, fourteen, for, boys, but, acknowledged, consent, to, be, meaningful, if, both, children, were, older, than, seven, years, of, age, there, were, authorities, that, said, that, such, consent, for, entering, marriage, could, take, place, earlier, marriage, would, then, be, valid, as, long, as, neither, of, the, two, parties, annulled, the, marital, agreement, before, reaching, puberty, or, if, they, had, already, consummated, the, marriage, judges, sometimes, honored, marriages, based, on, mutual, consent, at, ages, younger, than, seven, in, contrast, to, established, canon, there, are, recorded, marriages, of, two, and, three, year, olds, in, china, law, code, of, the, qingyuan, reign, published, in, 1202, which, catelogued, laws, that, came, into, effect, from, 1127, to, 1195, introduced, statutory, rape, in, the, following, decree, successful, intercourse, with, girls, younger, than, 10, is, considered, rape, in, all, circumstances, punishable, by, exile, 3000, li, miles, away, into, the, uncivilized, provinces, if, the, rape, was, unsuccessful, exile, by, 500, li, if, injury, occurs, in, process, death, by, hanging, from, 1275, in, england, as, part, of, its, provisions, on, rape, the, statute, of, westminster, 1275, made, it, a, misdemeanor, to, ravish, a, maiden, within, age, whether, with, or, without, her, consent, the, phrase, within, age, was, later, interpreted, by, jurist, sir, edward, coke, england, 17th, century, as, meaning, the, age, of, marriage, which, at, the, time, was, twelve, years, of, age, the, great, ming, code, 25th, section, criminal, code, on, rape, came, into, effect, from, 1373, raised, the, age, of, consent, to, 12, by, stating, girls, younger, than, 12, lack, rational, sexual, desires, therefore, any, intercourse, with, them, is, considered, the, same, as, rape, and, therefore, punishable, by, death, with, hanging, the, american, colonies, followed, the, english, tradition, and, the, law, was, more, of, a, guide, for, example, mary, hathaway, virginia, 1689, was, only, nine, when, she, was, married, to, william, williams, sir, edward, coke, made, it, clear, that, the, marriage, of, girls, under, 12, was, normal, and, the, age, at, which, a, girl, who, was, a, wife, was, eligible, for, a, dower, from, her, husband, s, estate, was, 9, even, though, her, husband, be, only, four, years, old, in, the, 16th, century, a, small, number, of, italian, and, german, states, set, the, minimum, age, for, sexual, intercourse, for, girls, setting, it, at, twelve, years, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, other, european, countries, also, began, to, enact, similar, laws, the, first, french, constitution, of, 1791, established, the, minimum, age, at, eleven, years, portugal, spain, denmark, and, the, swiss, cantons, initially, set, the, minimum, age, at, ten, to, twelve, years, age, of, consent, laws, were, historically, difficult, to, follow, and, enforce, legal, norms, based, on, age, were, not, in, general, common, until, the, 19th, century, because, clear, proof, of, exact, age, and, precise, date, of, birth, were, often, unavailable, in, 18th, century, australia, it, was, thought, that, children, were, inherently, sinful, and, vulnerable, to, sexual, temptations, punishment, for, giving, in, to, these, temptations, was, generally, left, to, parents, and, was, not, seen, as, a, government, matter, except, in, the, case, of, rape, australian, children, had, few, rights, and, were, legally, considered, the, chattel, of, their, parents, from, the, late, 18th, century, and, especially, in, the, 19th, century, attitudes, started, to, change, by, the, mid, 19th, century, there, was, increased, concern, over, child, sexual, abuse, a, general, shift, in, social, and, legal, attitudes, toward, issues, of, sex, occurred, during, the, modern, era, attitudes, on, the, appropriate, age, of, permission, for, females, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, drifted, toward, adulthood, while, ages, from, ten, to, thirteen, years, were, typically, regarded, as, acceptable, ages, for, sexual, consent, in, western, countries, during, the, mid, 19th, century, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, changing, attitudes, towards, sexuality, and, childhood, resulted, in, the, raising, of, the, age, of, consent, english, common, law, had, traditionally, set, the, age, of, consent, within, the, range, of, ten, to, twelve, years, old, but, the, offences, against, the, person, act, 1875, raised, this, to, thirteen, in, great, britain, and, ireland, early, feminists, of, the, social, purity, movement, such, as, josephine, butler, and, others, instrumental, in, securing, the, repeal, of, the, contagious, diseases, acts, began, to, turn, towards, the, problem, of, child, prostitution, by, the, end, of, the, 1870s, sensational, media, revelations, about, the, scourge, of, child, prostitution, in, london, in, the, 1880s, then, caused, outrage, among, the, respectable, middle, classes, leading, to, pressure, for, the, age, of, consent, to, be, raised, again, the, investigative, journalist, william, thomas, stead, of, the, pall, mall, gazette, was, pivotal, in, exposing, the, problem, of, child, prostitution, in, the, london, underworld, through, a, publicity, stunt, in, 1885, he, purchased, one, victim, eliza, armstrong, the, thirteen, year, old, daughter, of, a, chimney, sweep, for, five, pounds, and, took, her, to, a, brothel, where, she, was, drugged, he, then, published, a, series, of, four, expos, s, entitled, the, maiden, tribute, of, modern, babylon, which, shocked, its, readers, with, tales, of, child, prostitution, and, the, abduction, procurement, and, sale, of, young, english, virgins, to, continental, pleasure, palaces, the, maiden, tribute, was, an, instant, sensation, with, the, reading, public, and, victorian, society, was, thrown, into, an, uproar, about, prostitution, fearing, riots, on, a, national, scale, the, home, secretary, sir, william, harcourt, pleaded, in, vain, with, stead, to, cease, publication, of, the, articles, a, wide, variety, of, reform, groups, held, protest, meetings, and, marched, together, to, hyde, park, demanding, that, the, age, of, consent, be, raised, the, government, was, forced, to, propose, the, criminal, law, amendment, act, 1885, which, raised, the, age, of, consent, from, thirteen, to, sixteen, and, clamped, down, on, prostitution, in, the, united, states, as, late, as, the, 1880s, most, states, set, the, minimum, age, at, ten, to, twelve, in, delaware, it, was, seven, in, 1895, inspired, by, the, maiden, tribute, articles, female, reformers, in, the, u, s, initiated, their, own, campaign, which, petitioned, legislators, to, raise, the, legal, minimum, age, to, at, least, sixteen, with, the, ultimate, goal, to, raise, the, age, to, eighteen, the, campaign, was, successful, with, almost, all, states, raising, the, minimum, age, to, sixteen, to, eighteen, years, by, 1920, in, france, portugal, denmark, the, swiss, cantons, and, other, countries, the, minimum, age, was, raised, to, between, thirteen, and, sixteen, years, in, the, following, decades, though, the, original, arguments, for, raising, the, age, of, consent, were, based, on, morality, since, then, the, raison, d, tre, of, the, laws, has, changed, to, child, welfare, and, a, so, called, right, to, childhood, or, innocence, in, france, under, the, napoleonic, code, the, age, of, consent, was, set, in, 1832, at, eleven, and, was, raised, to, thirteen, in, 1863, it, was, increased, to, fifteen, in, 1945, in, the, 1970s, a, group, of, prominent, french, intellectuals, advocated, for, the, repeal, of, the, age, of, consent, laws, but, did, not, succeed, in, spain, it, was, set, in, 1822, at, puberty, age, and, changed, to, twelve, in, 1870, which, was, kept, until, 1999, when, it, became, 13, and, in, 2015, it, was, raised, to, 16, in, the, 21st, century, concerns, about, child, sex, tourism, and, commercial, sexual, exploitation, of, children, gained, prominence, resulting, in, legislative, changes, in, multiple, jurisdictions, as, well, as, the, adoption, of, international, laws, the, council, of, europe, convention, on, the, protection, of, children, against, sexual, exploitation, and, sexual, abuse, lanzarote, 25, october, 2007, and, the, european, union, s, directive, 2011, 92, eu, of, the, european, parliament, and, of, the, council, of, 13, december, 2011, on, combating, the, sexual, abuse, and, sexual, exploitation, of, children, and, child, pornography, were, adopted, the, optional, protocol, on, the, sale, of, children, child, prostitution, and, child, pornography, came, into, force, in, 2002, the, protocol, to, prevent, suppress, and, punish, trafficking, in, persons, especially, women, and, children, which, came, into, force, in, 2003, prohibits, commercial, sexual, exploitation, of, children, the, council, of, europe, convention, on, action, against, trafficking, in, human, beings, which, came, into, force, in, 2008, also, deals, with, commercial, sexual, exploitation, of, children, several, western, countries, have, raised, their, ages, of, consent, in, recent, decades, these, include, canada, in, 2008, from, 14, to, 16, and, in, europe, iceland, in, 2007, from, 14, to, 15, lithuania, in, 2010, from, 14, to, 16, croatia, in, 2013, from, 14, to, 15, spain, in, 2015, from, 13, to, 16, romania, in, 2020, from, 15, to, 16, and, estonia, in, 2022, from, 14, to, 16, the, international, criminal, court, statute, does, not, provide, a, specific, age, of, consent, in, its, rape, sexual, violence, statute, but, makes, reference, to, sexual, acts, committed, against, persons, incapable, of, giving, genuine, consent, and, the, explicative, footnote, states, it, is, understood, that, a, person, may, be, incapable, of, giving, genuine, consent, if, affected, by, natural, induced, or, age, related, incapacity, see, note, 51, sexual, relations, with, a, person, under, the, age, of, consent, is, a, crime, in, most, countries, jurisdictions, use, a, variety, of, terms, for, the, offense, including, child, sexual, abuse, statutory, rape, illegal, carnal, knowledge, corruption, of, a, minor, besides, others, the, enforcement, practices, of, age, of, consent, laws, vary, depending, on, the, social, sensibilities, of, the, particular, culture, see, above, often, enforcement, is, not, exercised, to, the, letter, of, the, law, with, legal, action, being, taken, only, when, a, sufficiently, socially, unacceptable, age, gap, exists, between, the, two, individuals, or, if, the, perpetrator, is, in, a, position, of, power, over, the, minor, e, g, a, teacher, minister, or, doctor, the, sex, of, each, participant, can, also, influence, perceptions, of, an, individual, s, guilt, and, therefore, enforcement, the, threshold, age, for, engaging, in, sexual, activity, varies, between, jurisdictions, most, jurisdictions, have, set, a, fixed, age, of, consent, however, some, jurisdictions, permit, sex, with, a, person, after, the, onset, of, their, puberty, such, as, yemen, but, only, in, marriage, ages, can, also, vary, based, on, the, type, of, calendar, used, such, as, the, lunar, calendar, how, birth, dates, in, leap, years, are, handled, or, even, the, method, by, which, birth, date, is, calculated, the, age, of, consent, is, a, legal, barrier, to, the, minor, s, ability, to, consent, and, therefore, obtaining, consent, is, not, in, general, a, defense, to, having, sexual, relations, with, a, person, under, the, prescribed, age, for, example, in, some, jurisdictions, it, is, a, defense, if, the, accused, can, show, their, reasonable, belief, that, the, victim, was, over, the, age, of, consent, however, where, such, a, defense, is, provided, it, normally, applies, only, when, the, victim, is, close, to, the, age, of, consent, or, the, accused, can, show, due, diligence, in, determining, the, age, of, the, victim, e, g, an, underage, person, who, used, a, fake, identification, document, claiming, to, be, of, legal, age, in, various, jurisdictions, age, of, consent, laws, do, not, apply, if, the, parties, are, legally, married, to, each, other, some, jurisdictions, have, laws, explicitly, allowing, sexual, acts, with, minors, under, the, age, of, consent, if, their, partner, is, close, in, age, in, canada, the, age, of, consent, is, 16, but, there, are, three, close, in, age, exemptions, sex, with, minors, aged, 14, 15, is, permitted, if, the, partner, is, less, than, five, years, older, sex, with, minors, aged, 12, 13, is, permitted, if, the, partner, is, less, than, two, years, older, and, sex, with, minors, aged, 0, 11, is, permitted, if, the, partner, is, 12, or, 13, years, of, age, as, long, as, the, partner, is, not, in, a, position, of, trust, over, the, other, minor, another, approach, takes, the, form, of, a, stipulation, that, sexual, intercourse, between, a, minor, and, an, older, partner, is, legal, under, the, condition, that, the, latter, does, not, exceed, a, certain, age, for, example, the, age, of, consent, in, the, us, state, of, delaware, is, 18, but, it, is, allowed, for, teenagers, aged, 16, and, 17, to, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, as, long, as, the, older, partner, is, younger, than, 30, the, law, in, canada, for, sex, between, minors, aged, 0, 11, with, a, partner, younger, than, 14, also, takes, this, form, other, countries, state, that, the, sexual, conduct, with, the, minor, is, not, to, be, punished, if, the, partners, are, of, a, similar, age, and, development, for, instance, the, age, of, consent, in, finland, is, 16, but, the, law, states, that, the, act, will, not, be, punished, if, there, is, no, great, difference, in, the, ages, or, the, mental, and, physical, maturity, of, the, persons, involved, in, slovenia, the, age, of, consent, is, 15, but, the, activity, is, only, deemed, criminal, if, there, is, a, marked, discrepancy, between, the, maturity, of, the, perpetrator, and, that, of, the, victim, some, jurisdictions, such, as, the, bahamas, uk, overseas, territory, of, the, cayman, islands, chile, paraguay, and, suriname, have, a, higher, age, of, consent, for, same, sex, sexual, activity, however, such, discrepancies, are, increasingly, being, challenged, within, bermuda, for, example, since, 1, november, 2019, under, section, 177, of, the, criminal, code, act, 1907, the, age, of, consent, for, vaginal, and, oral, sex, is, 16, but, for, anal, sex, it, is, 18, in, canada, the, united, kingdom, and, western, australia, for, example, the, age, of, consent, was, formerly, 21, for, same, sex, sexual, activity, between, males, with, no, laws, regarding, lesbian, sexual, activities, while, it, was, 16, for, heterosexual, sexual, activity, this, is, no, longer, the, case, and, the, age, of, consent, for, all, sexual, activity, is, 16, in, june, 2019, the, canadian, government, repealed, the, section, of, the, criminal, code, that, set, a, higher, age, of, consent, for, anal, intercourse, in, most, jurisdictions, where, the, age, of, consent, is, below, 18, such, as, england, and, wales, in, cases, where, a, person, aged, 18, or, older, is, in, a, position, of, trust, over, a, person, under, 18, the, age, of, consent, usually, rises, to, 18, or, higher, examples, of, such, positions, of, trust, include, relationships, between, teachers, and, students, for, example, in, england, and, wales, the, age, of, consent, is, 16, but, if, the, person, is, a, student, of, the, older, person, it, becomes, 18, in, several, jurisdictions, it, is, illegal, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, with, a, person, under, a, certain, age, under, certain, circumstances, regarding, the, relationship, in, question, such, as, if, it, involves, taking, advantage, of, or, corrupting, the, morals, of, the, young, person, for, example, while, the, age, of, consent, is, 14, in, germany, and, 16, in, canada, it, is, illegal, in, both, countries, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, with, a, person, under, 18, if, the, activity, exploits, the, younger, person, another, example, is, in, mexico, where, there, is, a, crime, called, estupro, defined, as, sexual, activity, with, a, person, over, the, age, of, consent, but, under, a, certain, age, limit, generally, 18, in, which, consent, of, the, younger, person, was, obtained, through, seduction, and, or, deceit, in, pennsylvania, the, age, of, consent, is, officially, 16, but, if, the, older, partner, is, 18, or, older, they, may, still, be, prosecuted, for, corruption, of, minors, for, their, corruption, or, tending, to, corrupt, the, morals, of, the, younger, person, a, growing, number, of, countries, have, specific, extraterritorial, legislation, that, prosecutes, their, citizens, in, their, homeland, should, they, engage, in, illicit, sexual, conduct, in, a, foreign, country, with, children, in, 2008, ecpat, reported, that, 44, countries, had, extraterritorial, child, sex, legislation, for, example, protect, act, of, 2003, a, federal, united, states, law, bans, sexual, activity, by, its, citizens, with, foreigners, or, with, u, s, citizens, from, another, state, if, the, partner, is, under, 18, and, the, activity, is, illegal, under, the, federal, state, or, local, law, this, applies, in, cases, where, any, of, the, partners, travels, into, or, out, of, the, united, states, or, from, one, state, into, another, for, the, purpose, of, an, illegal, sexual, encounter, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, the, gender, of, those, involved, should, lead, to, different, treatment, of, the, sexual, encounter, in, law, or, in, practice, traditionally, age, of, consent, laws, regarding, vaginal, intercourse, were, often, meant, to, protect, the, chastity, of, unmarried, girls, many, feminists, and, social, campaigners, in, the, 1970s, have, objected, to, the, social, importance, of, virginity, and, have, also, attempted, to, change, the, stereotypes, of, female, passivity, and, male, aggression, demanding, that, the, law, protect, children, from, exploitation, regardless, of, their, gender, rather, than, dealing, with, concerns, of, chastity, this, has, led, to, gender, neutral, laws, in, many, jurisdictions, on, the, other, hand, there, is, an, opposing, view, which, argues, that, the, act, of, vaginal, intercourse, is, an, unequal, act, for, males, and, females, due, to, issues, such, as, pregnancy, increased, risk, of, stds, and, risk, of, physical, injury, if, the, girl, is, too, young, and, not, physically, ready, in, the, us, in, michael, m, v, superior, ct, 450, u, s, 464, 1981, it, was, ruled, that, the, double, standard, of, offering, more, legal, protection, to, girls, is, valid, because, the, equal, protection, clause, does, not, mean, that, the, physiological, differences, between, men, and, women, must, be, disregarded, traditionally, many, age, of, consent, laws, dealt, primarily, with, men, engaging, in, sexual, acts, with, underage, girls, and, boys, the, latter, acts, often, falling, under, sodomy, and, buggery, laws, this, means, that, in, some, legal, systems, issues, of, women, having, sexual, contact, with, underage, partners, were, rarely, acknowledged, for, example, until, 2000, in, the, uk, before, the, sexual, offences, amendment, act, 2000, there, was, no, statutory, age, of, consent, for, lesbian, sex, in, new, zealand, before, 2005, there, were, no, age, of, consent, laws, dealing, with, women, having, sex, with, underage, boys, previously, in, fiji, male, offenders, of, child, sexual, abuse, could, receive, up, to, life, imprisonment, whilst, female, offenders, would, receive, up, to, seven, years, situations, like, these, have, been, attributed, to, societal, views, on, traditional, gender, roles, and, to, constructs, of, male, sexuality, and, female, sexuality, according, to, e, martellozzo, iewing, females, as, perpetrators, of, sexual, abuse, goes, against, every, stereotype, that, society, has, of, women, women, as, mothers, and, caregivers, and, not, as, people, who, abuse, and, harm, alissa, nutting, argues, that, women, are, not, acknowledged, as, perpetrators, of, sex, crimes, because, society, does, not, accept, that, women, have, an, autonomous, sexuality, of, their, own, the, age, at, which, a, person, can, be, legally, married, can, differ, from, the, age, of, consent, in, jurisdictions, where, the, marriageable, age, is, lower, than, the, age, of, consent, those, laws, usually, override, the, age, of, consent, laws, in, the, case, of, a, married, couple, where, one, or, both, partners, are, below, the, age, of, consent, some, jurisdictions, prohibit, all, sex, outside, of, marriage, irrespective, of, age, as, in, the, case, of, yemen, in, many, countries, there, are, specific, laws, dealing, with, child, prostitution, in, some, countries, states, or, other, jurisdictions, the, age, of, consent, may, be, lower, than, the, age, at, which, a, person, can, appear, in, pornographic, images, and, films, in, many, jurisdictions, the, minimum, age, for,
