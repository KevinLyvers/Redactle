exhibits, to, the, public, for, entertainment, and, inspiration, a, growing, fascination, for, natural, history, and, zoology, coupled, with, the, tremendous, expansion, in, the, urbanization, of,

of, the, zoo, that, had, been, established, in, 1828, it, was, the, first, zoo, to, use, open, enclosures, surrounded, by, moats, rather, than, barred, cages, to, better, approximate, animals, natural, environments, he, also, set, up, mixed, species, exhibits, and, based, the, layout, on, the, different, organizing, principle, of, geography, as, opposed, to, taxonomy, the, wroc, aw, zoo, polish, ogr, d, zoologiczny, we, wroc, awiu, is, the, oldest, zoo, in, poland, opened, in, 1865, when, the, city, was, part, of, prussia, and, was, home, to, about, 10, 500, animals, representing,

expansion, of, zoos, when, the, great, depression, severely, reduced, local, budgets, it, was, a, new, deal, for, animals, the, atlanta, zoo, founded, in, 1886, suffered, neglect, by, 1984, it, was, ranked, among, the, ten, worst, zoos, in, the, united, states, systematic, reform, by, 2000, put, it, on, the, list, of, the, ten, best, by, 2020, the, united, states, featured, 230, accredited, zoos, and, aquariums, across, 45, states, accommodating, 800, 000, animals, and, 6, 000, species, out, of, which, about, 1, 000, are, endangered, the, zoos, provide, 208, 000, jobs, and, with, an, annual, budget, of, 230, million, for, wildlife, conservation, they, attract, over, 200, million, visits, a, year, and, have, special, programs, for, schools, they, are, organized, by, the, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, japan, s, first, modern, zoo, tokyo, s, ueno, imperial, zoological, gardens, opened, in, 1882, based, on, european, models, in, world, war, ii, it, was, used, to, teach, the, japanese, people, about, the, lands, recently, conquered, by, the, army, in, 1943, fearing, american, bombing, attacks, the, government, ordered, the, zoo, to, euthanize, dangerous, animals, that, might, escape, when, ecology, emerged, as, a, matter, of, public, interest, in, the, 1970s, a, few, zoos, began, to, consider, making, conservation, their, central, role, with, gerald, durrell, of, the, jersey, zoo, george, rabb, of, brookfield, zoo, and, william, conway, of, the, bronx, zoo, wildlife, conservation, society, leading, the, discussion, from, then, on, zoo, professionals, became, increasingly, aware, of, the, need, to, engage, themselves, in, conservation, programs, and, the, american, zoo, association, soon, said, that, conservation, was, its, highest, priority, in, order, to, stress, conservation, issues, many, large, zoos, stopped, the, practice, of, having, animals, perform, tricks, for, visitors, the, detroit, zoo, for, example, stopped, its, elephant, show, in, 1969, and, its, chimpanzee, show, in, 1983, acknowledging, that, the, trainers, had, probably, abused, the, animals, to, get, them, to, perform, mass, destruction, of, wildlife, habitat, has, yet, to, cease, all, over, the, world, and, many, species, such, as, elephants, big, cats, penguins, tropical, birds, primates, rhinos, exotic, reptiles, and, many, others, are, in, danger, of, dying, out, many, of, today, s, zoos, hope, to, stop, or, slow, the, decline, of, many, endangered, species, and, see, their, primary, purpose, as, breeding, endangered, species, in, captivity, and, reintroducing, them, into, the, wild, modern, zoos, also, aim, to, help, teach, visitors, the, importance, of, animal, conservation, often, through, letting, visitors, witness, the, animals, firsthand, some, critics, and, the, majority, of, animal, rights, activists, say, that, zoos, no, matter, their, intentions, or, how, noble, these, intentions, are, immoral, and, serve, as, nothing, but, to, fulfill, human, leisure, at, the, expense, of, the, animals, an, opinion, that, has, spread, over, the, years, however, zoo, advocates, argue, that, their, efforts, make, a, difference, in, wildlife, conservation, and, education, humans, were, occasionally, displayed, in, cages, at, zoos, along, with, non, human, animals, to, illustrate, the, differences, between, people, of, european, and, non, european, origin, in, september, 1906, william, hornaday, director, of, the, bronx, zoo, in, new, york, with, the, agreement, of, madison, grant, head, of, the, new, york, zoological, society, had, ota, benga, a, congolese, pygmy, displayed, in, a, cage, with, the, chimpanzees, then, with, an, orangutan, named, dohong, and, a, parrot, the, exhibit, was, intended, as, an, example, of, the, missing, link, between, the, orangutan, and, white, man, it, triggered, protests, from, the, city, s, clergymen, but, the, public, reportedly, flocked, to, see, benga, humans, were, also, displayed, at, various, events, especially, colonial, expositions, such, as, the, 1931, paris, colonial, exposition, with, the, practice, continuing, in, belgium, at, least, to, as, late, as, 1958, in, a, congolese, village, display, at, expo, 58, in, brussels, these, displays, while, sometimes, called, human, zoos, usually, did, not, take, place, in, zoos, or, use, cages, zoo, animals, live, in, enclosures, that, often, attempt, to, replicate, their, natural, habitats, or, behavioral, patterns, for, the, benefit, of, both, the, animals, and, visitors, nocturnal, animals, are, often, housed, in, buildings, with, a, reversed, light, dark, cycle, i, e, only, dim, white, or, red, lights, are, on, during, the, day, so, the, animals, are, active, during, visitor, hours, and, brighter, lights, on, at, night, when, the, animals, sleep, special, climate, conditions, may, be, created, for, animals, living, in, extreme, environments, such, as, penguins, special, enclosures, for, birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, fish, and, other, aquatic, life, forms, have, also, been, developed, some, zoos, have, walk, through, exhibits, where, visitors, enter, enclosures, of, non, aggressive, species, such, as, lemurs, marmosets, birds, lizards, and, turtles, visitors, are, asked, to, keep, to, paths, and, avoid, showing, or, eating, foods, that, the, animals, might, snatch, some, zoos, keep, animals, in, larger, outdoor, enclosures, confining, them, with, moats, and, fences, rather, than, in, cages, safari, parks, also, known, as, zoo, parks, and, lion, farms, allow, visitors, to, drive, through, them, and, come, in, close, proximity, to, the, animals, sometimes, visitors, are, able, to, feed, animals, through, the, car, windows, the, first, safari, park, was, whipsnade, park, in, bedfordshire, england, opened, by, the, zoological, society, of, london, in, 1931, which, today, 2014, covers, 600, acres, 2, 4, km, 2, since, the, early, 1970s, an, 1, 800, acre, 7, km, 2, park, in, the, san, pasqual, valley, near, san, diego, has, featured, the, san, diego, zoo, safari, park, run, by, the, zoological, society, of, san, diego, one, of, two, state, supported, zoo, parks, in, north, carolina, is, the, 2, 000, acre, 8, 1, km, 2, north, carolina, zoo, in, asheboro, the, 500, acre, 2, 0, km, 2, werribee, open, range, zoo, in, melbourne, australia, displays, animals, living, in, an, artificial, savannah, the, first, public, aquarium, was, opened, at, the, london, zoo, in, 1853, this, was, followed, by, the, opening, of, public, aquaria, in, continental, europe, e, g, paris, in, 1859, hamburg, in, 1864, berlin, in, 1869, and, brighton, in, 1872, and, the, united, states, e, g, boston, in, 1859, washington, in, 1873, san, francisco, woodward, s, garden, in, 1873, and, the, new, york, aquarium, at, battery, park, in, 1896, roadside, zoos, are, found, throughout, north, america, particularly, in, remote, locations, they, are, often, small, for, profit, zoos, often, intended, to, attract, visitors, to, some, other, facility, such, as, a, gas, station, the, animals, may, be, trained, to, perform, tricks, and, visitors, are, able, to, get, closer, to, them, than, in, larger, zoos, since, they, are, sometimes, less, regulated, roadside, zoos, are, often, subject, to, accusations, of, neglect, and, cruelty, in, june, 2014, the, animal, legal, defense, fund, filed, a, lawsuit, against, the, iowa, based, roadside, cricket, hollow, zoo, for, violating, the, endangered, species, act, by, failing, to, provide, proper, care, for, its, animals, since, filing, the, lawsuit, aldf, has, obtained, records, from, investigations, conducted, by, the, usda, s, animal, and, plant, health, inspection, services, these, records, show, that, the, zoo, is, also, violating, the, animal, welfare, act, a, petting, zoo, also, called, petting, farms, or, children, s, zoos, features, a, combination, of, domestic, animals, and, wild, species, that, are, docile, enough, to, touch, and, feed, to, ensure, the, animals, health, the, food, is, supplied, by, the, zoo, either, from, vending, machines, or, a, kiosk, nearby, an, animal, theme, park, is, a, combination, of, an, amusement, park, and, a, zoo, mainly, for, entertaining, and, commercial, purposes, marine, mammal, parks, such, as, sea, world, and, marineland, are, more, elaborate, dolphinariums, keeping, whales, and, containing, additional, entertainment, attractions, another, kind, of, animal, theme, park, contains, more, entertainment, and, amusement, elements, than, the, classical, zoo, such, as, stage, shows, roller, coasters, and, mythical, creatures, some, examples, are, busch, gardens, tampa, bay, in, tampa, florida, both, disney, s, animal, kingdom, and, gatorland, in, orlando, florida, flamingo, land, in, north, yorkshire, england, and, six, flags, discovery, kingdom, in, vallejo, california, by, 2000, most, animals, being, displayed, in, zoos, were, the, offspring, of, other, zoo, animals, this, trend, however, was, and, still, is, somewhat, species, specific, when, animals, are, transferred, between, zoos, they, usually, spend, time, in, quarantine, and, are, given, time, to, acclimatize, to, their, new, enclosures, which, are, often, designed, to, mimic, their, natural, environment, for, example, some, species, of, penguins, may, require, refrigerated, enclosures, guidelines, on, necessary, care, for, such, animals, is, published, in, the, international, zoo, yearbook, animal, exchanges, between, facilities, are, usually, made, voluntarily, based, on, a, model, of, cooperation, for, conservation, loaned, animals, usually, remain, the, property, of, the, original, park, and, any, offspring, yielded, by, loaned, animals, are, usually, divided, between, the, lending, and, holding, institutions, for, decades, the, capture, of, wild, animals, or, purchasing, of, animals, has, been, broadly, considered, unethical, and, has, not, been, practiced, by, reputable, zoos, especially, in, large, animals, a, limited, number, of, spaces, are, available, in, zoos, as, a, consequence, various, management, tools, are, used, to, preserve, the, space, for, the, genetically, most, important, individuals, and, to, reduce, the, risk, of, inbreeding, management, of, animal, populations, is, typically, through, international, organizations, such, as, aza, and, eaza, zoos, have, several, different, ways, of, managing, the, animal, populations, such, as, moves, between, zoos, contraception, sale, of, excess, animals, and, euthanization, culling, contraception, can, be, an, effective, way, to, limit, a, population, s, breeding, however, it, may, also, have, health, repercussions, and, can, be, difficult, or, even, impossible, to, reverse, in, some, animals, additionally, some, species, may, lose, their, reproductive, capability, entirely, if, prevented, from, breeding, for, a, period, whether, through, contraceptives, or, isolation, but, further, study, is, needed, on, the, subject, sale, of, surplus, animals, from, zoos, was, once, common, and, in, some, cases, animals, have, ended, up, in, substandard, facilities, in, recent, decades, the, practice, of, selling, animals, from, certified, zoos, has, declined, a, large, number, of, animals, are, culled, each, year, in, zoos, but, this, is, controversial, a, highly, publicized, culling, as, part, of, population, management, was, that, of, a, healthy, giraffe, at, copenhagen, zoo, in, 2014, the, zoo, argued, that, his, genes, already, were, well, represented, in, captivity, making, the, giraffe, unsuitable, for, future, breeding, there, were, offers, to, adopt, him, and, an, online, petition, to, save, him, had, many, thousand, signatories, but, the, culling, proceeded, although, zoos, in, some, countries, have, been, open, about, culling, the, controversy, of, the, subject, and, pressure, from, the, public, has, resulted, in, others, being, closed, this, stands, in, contrast, to, most, zoos, publicly, announcing, animal, births, furthermore, while, many, zoos, are, willing, to, cull, smaller, and, or, low, profile, animals, fewer, are, willing, to, do, it, with, larger, high, profile, species, many, animals, breed, readily, in, captivity, zoos, frequently, are, forced, to, intentionally, limit, captive, breeding, because, of, a, lack, of, natural, wild, habitat, in, which, to, reintroduce, animals, this, highlights, the, importance, of, in, situ, conservation, or, preservation, of, natural, spaces, in, addition, to, the, utility, of, zoo, captive, breeding, and, reintroduction, programs, in, situ, conservation, and, reintroduction, programs, are, key, elements, to, obtaining, certification, by, reputable, organisations, such, as, the, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, aza, efforts, to, clone, endangered, species, in, the, united, states, europe, and, asia, are, frequently, embedded, in, zoos, and, zoological, parks, the, position, of, most, modern, zoos, in, australasia, asia, europe, and, north, america, particularly, those, with, scientific, societies, is, that, they, display, wild, animals, primarily, for, the, conservation, of, endangered, species, as, well, as, for, research, purposes, and, education, and, secondarily, for, the, entertainment, of, visitors, the, zoological, society, of, london, states, in, its, charter, that, its, aim, is, the, advancement, of, zoology, and, animal, physiology, and, the, introduction, of, new, and, curious, subjects, of, the, animal, kingdom, it, maintains, two, research, institutes, the, nuffield, institute, of, comparative, medicine, and, the, wellcome, institute, of, comparative, physiology, in, the, united, states, the, penrose, research, laboratory, of, the, philadelphia, zoo, focuses, on, the, study, of, comparative, pathology, the, world, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, produced, its, first, conservation, strategy, in, 1993, and, in, november, 2004, it, adopted, a, new, strategy, that, sets, out, the, aims, and, mission, of, zoological, gardens, of, the, 21st, century, when, studying, behaviour, of, captive, animals, several, things, should, however, be, taken, into, account, before, drawing, conclusions, about, wild, populations, including, that, captive, populations, are, often, smaller, than, wild, ones, and, that, the, space, available, to, each, animal, is, often, less, than, in, the, wild, conservation, programs, all, over, the, world, fight, to, protect, species, from, going, extinct, but, many, conservation, programs, are, underfunded, and, under, represented, conservation, programs, can, struggle, to, fight, bigger, issues, like, habitat, loss, and, illness, it, often, takes, a, lot, of, funding, and, long, time, periods, to, rebuild, degraded, habitats, both, of, which, are, scarce, in, conservation, efforts, the, current, state, of, conservation, programs, cannot, rely, solely, in, situ, on, site, conservation, plans, alone, ex, situ, off, site, conservation, may, therefore, provide, a, suitable, alternative, off, site, conservation, relies, on, zoos, national, parks, or, other, care, facilities, to, support, the, rehabilitation, of, the, animals, and, their, populations, zoos, benefit, conservation, by, providing, suitable, habitats, and, care, to, endangered, animals, when, properly, regulated, they, present, a, safe, clean, environment, for, the, animals, to, increase, populations, sizes, a, study, on, amphibian, conservation, and, zoos, addressed, these, problems, by, writing, whilst, addressing, in, situ, threats, particularly, habitat, loss, degradation, and, fragmentation, is, of, primary, importance, for, many, amphibian, species, in, situ, conservation, alone, will, not, be, enough, especially, in, light, of, current, un, mitigatable, threats, that, can, impact, populations, very, rapidly, such, as, chytridiomycosis, ex, situ, programmes, can, complement, in, situ, activities, in, a, number, of, ways, including, maintaining, genetically, and, demographically, viable, populations, while, threats, are, either, better, understood, or, mitigated, in, the, wild, the, breeding, of, endangered, species, is, coordinated, by, cooperative, breeding, programmes, containing, international, studbooks, and, coordinators, who, evaluate, the, roles, of, individual, animals, and, institutions, from, a, global, or, regional, perspective, and, there, are, regional, programmes, all, over, the, world, for, the, conservation, of, endangered, species, in, africa, conservation, is, handled, by, the, african, preservation, program, app, in, the, u, s, and, canada, by, species, survival, plans, in, australasia, by, the, australasian, species, management, program, in, europe, by, the, european, endangered, species, program, and, in, japan, south, asia, and, south, east, asia, by, the, japanese, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, the, south, asian, zoo, association, for, regional, cooperation, and, the, south, east, asian, zoo, association, besides, conservation, of, captive, species, large, zoos, may, form, a, suitable, environment, for, wild, native, animals, such, as, herons, to, live, in, or, visit, a, colony, of, black, crowned, night, herons, has, regularly, summered, at, the, national, zoo, in, washington, d, c, for, more, than, a, century, some, zoos, may, provide, information, to, visitors, on, wild, animals, visiting, or, living, in, the, zoo, or, encourage, them, by, directing, them, to, specific, feeding, or, breeding, platforms, in, modern, well, regulated, zoos, breeding, is, controlled, to, maintain, a, self, sustaining, global, captive, population, this, is, not, the, case, in, some, less, well, regulated, zoos, often, based, in, poorer, regions, overall, stock, turnover, of, animals, during, a, year, in, a, select, group, of, poor, zoos, was, reported, as, 20, 25, with, 75, of, wild, caught, apes, dying, in, captivity, within, the, first, 20, months, the, authors, of, the, report, stated, that, before, successful, breeding, programs, the, high, mortality, rate, was, the, reason, for, the, massive, scale, of, importations, one, 2, year, study, indicated, that, of, 19, 361, mammals, that, left, accredited, zoos, in, the, u, s, between, 1992, and, 1998, 7, 420, 38, went, to, dealers, auctions, hunting, ranches, unaccredited, zoos, and, individuals, and, game, farms, the, welfare, of, zoo, animals, varies, widely, many, zoos, work, to, improve, their, animal, enclosures, and, make, it, fit, the, animals, needs, but, constraints, such, as, size, and, expense, can, complicate, this, the, type, of, enclosure, and, the, husbandry, are, of, great, importance, in, determining, the, welfare, of, animals, substandard, enclosures, can, lead, to, decreased, lifespans, caused, by, factors, as, human, diseases, unsafe, materials, in, the, cages, and, possible, escape, attempts, bendow, 382, however, when, zoos, take, time, to, think, about, the, animal, s, welfare, zoos, can, become, a, place, of, refuge, today, many, zoos, are, improving, enclosures, by, including, tactile, and, sensory, features, in, the, habitat, that, allow, animals, to, encourage, natural, behaviors, these, additions, can, prove, to, be, effective, in, improving, the, lives, of, animals, in, captivity, the, tactile, and, sensory, features, will, vary, depending, on, the, species, of, animal, there, are, animals, that, are, injured, in, the, wild, and, are, unable, to, survive, on, their, own, but, in, the, zoos, they, can, live, out, the, rest, of, their, lives, healthy, and, happy, mcgaffin, in, recent, years, some, zoos, have, chosen, to, move, out, some, larger, animals, because, they, do, not, have, the, space, available, to, provide, an, adequate, enclosure, for, them, lemonic, mcdowell, and, bjerklie, 50, an, issue, with, animal, welfare, in, zoos, is, that, best, animal, husbandry, practices, are, often, not, completely, known, especially, for, species, that, are, only, kept, in, a, small, number, of, zoos, to, solve, this, organizations, like, eaza, and, aza, have, begun, to, develop, husbandry, manuals, many, modern, zoos, attempt, to, improve, animal, welfare, by, providing, more, space, and, behavioural, enrichments, this, often, involves, housing, the, animals, in, naturalistic, enclosures, that, allow, the, animals, to, express, more, of, their, natural, behaviours, such, as, roaming, and, foraging, whilst, many, zoos, have, been, working, hard, on, this, change, in, some, zoos, some, enclosures, still, remain, barren, concrete, enclosures, or, other, minimally, enriched, cages, sometimes, animals, are, unable, to, perform, certain, behaviors, in, zoos, like, seasonal, migration, or, traveling, over, large, distances, whether, these, behaviors, are, necessary, for, good, welfare, however, is, unclear, some, behaviors, are, seen, as, essential, for, an, animal, s, welfare, whilst, others, are, not, it, is, however, shown, that, even, in, limited, spaces, certain, natural, behaviors, can, still, be, performed, a, study, in, 2014, for, example, found, that, asian, elephants, in, zoos, covered, similar, or, higher, walking, distances, then, sedentary, wild, populations, migration, in, the, wild, can, also, be, related, to, food, scarcity, or, other, unfavorable, environmental, problems, however, a, proper, zoo, enclosure, never, runs, out, of, food, or, water, and, in, case, of, unfavorable, temperatures, or, weather, animals, are, provided, with, indoor, shelter, animals, in, zoos, can, exhibit, behaviors, that, are, abnormal, in, their, frequency, intensity, or, would, not, normally, be, part, of, their, behavioural, repertoire, whilst, these, types, of, behaviors, can, be, a, sign, of, bad, welfare, and, stress, this, is, not, necessarily, the, case, other, measurements, or, behavioral, research, is, advised, before, determining, whether, an, animal, performing, stereotypical, behavior, is, living, in, bad, welfare, or, not, examples, of, stereotypical, behaviors, are, pacing, head, bobbing, obsessive, grooming, and, feather, plucking, a, study, examining, data, collected, over, four, decades, found, that, polar, bears, lions, tigers, and, cheetahs, can, display, stereotypical, behaviors, in, many, older, exhibits, however, they, also, noted, that, in, more, modern, naturalistic, exhibits, these, behaviors, could, completely, disappear, elephants, have, also, been, recorded, displaying, stereotypical, behaviours, in, the, form, of, swaying, back, and, forth, trunk, swaying, or, route, tracing, this, has, been, observed, in, 54, of, individuals, in, uk, zoos, however, it, has, been, shown, that, modern, facilities, and, modern, husbandry, can, greatly, decrease, or, even, entirely, remove, abnormal, behaviors, a, study, of, a, group, of, elephants, in, planckendael, showed, that, the, older, wild, caught, animals, displayed, many, stereotypical, behaviors, these, elephants, had, spent, part, of, their, lives, either, in, a, circus, or, in, other, substandard, enclosures, on, the, other, hand, the, elephants, born, in, the, modern, facilities, that, had, lived, in, a, herd, their, whole, life, barely, displayed, any, stereotypical, behaviors, at, all, the, life, history, of, an, animal, is, thus, extremely, important, when, analyzing, the, causes, of, stereotypical, behavior, as, this, can, be, a, historical, relict, instead, of, a, result, of, present, day, husbandry, some, zoos, have, used, psychoactive, drugs, such, as, prozac, in, attempting, to, stop, animals, from, exhibiting, the, behaviors, the, influence, on, a, zoological, environment, on, animal, s, longevity, is, not, straightforward, a, study, of, 50, mammal, species, found, that, 84, of, them, lived, longer, in, zoos, than, they, would, in, the, wild, on, average, on, the, other, hand, some, research, claims, that, elephants, in, japanese, zoos, would, live, shorter, than, their, wild, counterparts, at, just, 17, years, this, has, been, refuted, by, other, studies, however, such, studies, might, not, yet, fully, represent, recent, improvements, in, husbandry, for, example, studies, show, that, captive, bred, elephants, already, have, a, lower, mortality, risk, then, wild, caught, ones, climatic, conditions, can, make, it, difficult, to, keep, some, animals, in, zoos, in, some, locations, for, example, alaska, zoo, had, an, elephant, named, maggie, she, was, housed, in, a, small, indoor, enclosure, because, the, outdoor, temperature, was, too, low, tsetse, flies, have, invaded, zoos, that, have, been, established, in, the, tsetse, zone, more, concerning, tsetse, borne, species, of, trypanosomes, have, entered, zoos, outside, the, traditional, tsetse, zone, in, infected, animals, imported, and, added, to, their, collections, whether, these, can, be, controlled, depends, on, several, factors, vale, 1998, found, that, the, technique, used, in, placing, attractants, was, important, and, green, 1988, torr, 1994, torr, et, al, 1995, and, torr, et, al, 1997, found, the, availability, for, specifically, needed, attractants, for, the, specific, job, to, also, vary, widely, some, critics, and, many, animal, rights, activists, argue, that, zoo, animals, are, treated, as, voyeuristic, objects, rather, than, living, creatures, and, often, suffer, due, to, the, transition, from, being, free, and, wild, to, captivity, ever, since, imports, of, wild, caught, animals, can, became, more, regulated, by, organizations, like, cites, and, national, laws, zoos, have, started, sustaining, their, populations, via, breeding, this, change, started, around, the, 1970s, many, corporations, in, the, form, of, breeding, programs, have, been, set, up, since, for, both, common, and, endangered, species, emma, marris, writing, an, opinion, piece, for, the, new, york, times, suggested, zoos, stopped, breeding, all, their, animals, with, the, possible, exception, of, any, endangered, species, with, a, real, chance, of, being, released, back, into, the, wild, eventually, the, only, animals, on, display, would, be, a, few, ancient, holdovers, from, the, old, menageries, animals, in, active, conservation, breeding, programs, and, perhaps, a, few, rescues, such, zoos, might, even, be, merged, with, sanctuaries, in, 2017, activist, travel, company, responsible, travel, and, anti, captive, animal, charity, the, born, free, foundation, conducted, an, independent, survey, of, 1, 000, members, of, the, uk, public, who, had, visited, a, zoo, in, the, previous, five, years, to, gauge, public, understanding, of, zoos, contribution, to, conservation, the, results, showed, that, zoos, spend, on, average, ten, times, less, than, visitors, expect, on, conservation, it, also, emerged, that, three, quarters, of, visitors, would, expect, at, least, one, fifth, of, the, animals, in, a, zoo, to, be, endangered, the, actual, figure, according, to, the, born, free, foundation, is, 10, in, light, of, these, findings, and, ongoing, animal, welfare, concerns, in, 2017, responsible, travel, became, the, first, travel, company, to, stop, promoting, holidays, that, include, visits, to, a, zoo, in, some, countries, feeding, live, vertebrates, to, zoo, animals, is, illegal, under, most, circumstances, the, uk, animal, welfare, act, of, 2006, for, example, states, that, prey, must, be, killed, for, feeding, unless, this, threatens, the, health, of, the, predator, some, zoos, had, already, adopted, such, practices, prior, to, the, implementation, of, such, policies, london, zoo, for, example, stopped, feeding, live, vertebrates, in, the, 20th, century, long, before, the, animal, welfare, act, despite, being, illegal, in, china, some, zoos, have, been, found, to, still, feed, live, vertebrates, to, their, predators, in, some, parks, like, xiongsen, bear, and, tiger, mountain, village, live, chickens, and, other, livestock, were, found, to, be, thrown, into, the, enclosures, of, tigers, and, other, predators, in, guilin, in, south, east, china, live, cows, and, pigs, are, thrown, to, tigers, to, amuse, visitors, other, chinese, parks, like, shenzhen, safari, park, have, already, stopped, this, practice, after, facing, heavy, criticism, in, the, united, states, any, public, animal, exhibit, must, be, licensed, and, inspected, by, the, department, of, agriculture, the, environmental, protection, agency, and, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, depending, on, the, animals, they, exhibit, the, activities, of, zoos, are, regulated, by, laws, including, the, endangered, species, act, the, animal, welfare, act, the, migratory, bird, treaty, act, of, 1918, and, others, additionally, zoos, in, several, countries, may, choose, to, pursue, accreditation, by, the, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, aza, which, originated, in, the, u, s, to, achieve, accreditation, a, zoo, must, pass, an, application, and, inspection, process, and, meet, or, exceed, the, aza, s, standards, for, animal, health, and, welfare, fundraising, zoo, staffing, and, involvement, in, global, conservation, efforts, inspection, is, performed, by, three, experts, typically, one, veterinarian, one, expert, in, animal, care, and, one, expert, in, zoo, management, and, operations, and, then, reviewed, by, a, panel, of, twelve, experts, before, accreditation, is, awarded, this, accreditation, process, is, repeated, once, every, five, years, the, aza, estimates, that, there, are, approximately, 2, 400, animal, exhibits, operating, under, usda, license, as, of, february, 2007, fewer, than, 10, are, accredited, the, european, union, introduced, a, directive, to, strengthen, the, conservation, role, of, zoos, making, it, a, statutory, requirement, that, they, participate, in, conservation, and, education, and, requiring, all, member, states, to, set, up, systems, for, their, licensing, and, inspection, zoos, are, regulated, in, the, uk, by, the, zoo, licensing, act, of, 1981, which, came, into, effect, in, 1984, a, zoo, is, defined, as, any, establishment, where, wild, animals, are, kept, for, exhibition, to, which, members, of, the, public, have, access, with, or, without, charge, for, admission, seven, or, more, days, in, any, period, of, twelve, consecutive, months, excluding, circuses, and, pet, shops, the, act, requires, that, all, zoos, be, inspected, and, licensed, and, that, animals, kept, in, enclosures, are, provided, with, a, suitable, environment, in, which, they, can, express, most, normal, behavior
