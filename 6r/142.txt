sip, or, small, portion, which, does, not, result, in, a, measurable, increase, in, the, participant, s, blood, alcohol, content, this, controlled, and, symbolic, consumption, of, the, sacramental, wine, is, an, integral, part, of, the, eucharistic, rite, and, does, not, lead, to, intoxication, according, to, the, catholic, church, the, sacramental, wine, used, in, the, eucharist, must, contain, alcohol, canon, 924, of, the, present, code, of, canon, law, 1983, states, 3, the, wine, must, be, natural, made, from, grapes, of, the, vine, and, not, corrupt, in, lutheranism, the, catechism,

extract, of, plant, or, animal, material, dissolved, in, ethanol, ethyl, alcohol, solvent, concentrations, of, 25, 60, are, common, but, may, run, as, high, as, 90, in, chemistry, a, tincture, is, a, solution, that, has, ethanol, as, its, solvent, in, herbal, medicine, alcoholic, tinctures, are, made, with, various, ethanol, concentrations, which, should, be, at, least, 20, alcohol, for,

people, come, together, to, make, beer, the, concentration, of, alcohol, in, a, beverage, is, usually, stated, as, the, percentage, of, alcohol, by, volume, abv, the, number, of, milliliters, ml, of, pure, ethanol, in, 100, ml, of, beverage, or, as, proof, in, the, united, states, proof, is, twice, the, percentage, of, alcohol, by, volume, at, 60, degrees, fahrenheit, e, g, 80, proof, 40, abv, degrees, proof, were, formerly, used, in, the, united, kingdom, where, 100, degrees, proof, was, equivalent, to, 57, 1, abv, historically, this, was, the, most, dilute, spirit, that, would, sustain, the, combustion, of, gunpowder, ordinary, distillation, cannot, produce, alcohol, of, more, than, 95, 6, by, weight, which, is, about, 97, 2, abv, 194, 4, proof, because, at, that, point, alcohol, is, an, azeotrope, with, water, a, spirit, which, contains, a, very, high, level, of, alcohol, and, does, not, contain, any, added, flavoring, is, commonly, called, a, neutral, spirit, generally, any, distilled, alcoholic, beverage, of, 170, us, proof, or, higher, is, considered, to, be, a, neutral, spirit, most, yeasts, cannot, reproduce, when, the, concentration, of, alcohol, is, higher, than, about, 18, so, that, is, the, practical, limit, for, the, strength, of, fermented, drinks, such, as, wine, beer, and, sake, however, some, strains, of, yeast, have, been, developed, that, can, reproduce, in, solutions, of, up, to, 25, abv, shot, sizes, vary, significantly, from, country, to, country, in, the, united, kingdom, serving, size, in, licensed, premises, is, regulated, under, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1985, a, single, serving, size, of, spirits, gin, whisky, rum, and, vodka, are, sold, in, 25, ml, or, 35, ml, quantities, or, multiples, thereof, beer, is, typically, served, in, pints, 568, ml, but, is, also, served, in, half, pints, or, third, pints, in, israel, a, single, serving, size, of, spirits, is, about, twice, as, much, 50, or, 60, ml, the, shape, of, a, glass, can, have, a, significant, effect, on, how, much, one, pours, a, cornell, university, study, of, students, and, bartenders, pouring, showed, both, groups, pour, more, into, short, wide, glasses, than, into, tall, slender, glasses, aiming, to, pour, one, shot, of, alcohol, 1, 5, ounces, or, 44, 3, ml, students, on, average, poured, 45, 5, ml, 59, 6, ml, 30, more, respectively, into, the, tall, and, short, glasses, the, bartenders, scored, similarly, on, average, pouring, 20, 5, more, into, the, short, glasses, more, experienced, bartenders, were, more, accurate, pouring, 10, 3, less, alcohol, than, less, experienced, bartenders, practice, reduced, the, tendency, of, both, groups, to, over, pour, for, tall, slender, glasses, but, not, for, short, wide, glasses, these, misperceptions, are, attributed, to, two, perceptual, biases, there, is, no, single, standard, but, a, standard, drink, of, 10g, alcohol, which, is, used, in, the, who, audit, alcohol, use, disorders, identification, test, s, questionnaire, form, example, have, been, adopted, by, more, countries, than, any, other, amount, 10, grams, is, equivalent, to, 12, 7, millilitres, a, standard, drink, is, a, notional, drink, that, contains, a, specified, amount, of, pure, alcohol, the, standard, drink, is, used, in, many, countries, to, quantify, alcohol, intake, it, is, usually, expressed, as, a, measure, of, beer, wine, or, spirits, one, standard, drink, always, contains, the, same, amount, of, alcohol, regardless, of, serving, size, or, the, type, of, alcoholic, beverage, the, standard, drink, varies, significantly, from, country, to, country, for, example, it, is, 7, 62, ml, 6, grams, of, alcohol, in, austria, but, in, japan, it, is, 25, ml, 19, 75, grams, alcohol, laws, regulate, the, manufacture, packaging, labelling, distribution, sale, consumption, blood, alcohol, content, of, motor, vehicle, drivers, open, containers, and, transportation, of, alcoholic, drinks, such, laws, generally, seek, to, reduce, the, adverse, health, and, social, impacts, of, alcohol, consumption, in, particular, alcohol, laws, set, the, legal, drinking, age, which, usually, varies, between, 15, and, 21, years, old, sometimes, depending, upon, the, type, of, alcoholic, drink, e, g, beer, vs, wine, vs, hard, liquor, or, distillates, some, countries, do, not, have, a, legal, drinking, or, purchasing, age, but, most, countries, set, the, minimum, age, at, 18, years, some, countries, such, as, the, u, s, have, the, drinking, age, higher, than, the, legal, age, of, majority, 18, at, age, 21, in, all, 50, states, such, laws, may, take, the, form, of, permitting, distribution, only, to, licensed, stores, monopoly, stores, or, pubs, and, they, are, often, combined, with, taxation, which, serves, to, reduce, the, demand, for, alcohol, by, raising, its, price, and, it, is, a, form, of, revenue, for, governments, these, laws, also, often, limit, the, hours, or, days, e, g, blue, laws, on, which, alcohol, may, be, sold, or, served, as, can, also, be, seen, in, the, last, call, ritual, in, us, and, canadian, bars, where, bartenders, and, servers, ask, patrons, to, place, their, last,

offense, although, such, laws, may, exempt, non, muslims, alcohol, is, a, depressant, which, in, low, doses, causes, euphoria, reduces, anxiety, and, increases, sociability, in, higher, doses, it, causes, drunkenness, stupor, unconsciousness, or, death, a, meta, analysis, of, 107, cohort, studies, concludes, low, daily, alcohol, intake, provides, no, health, benefits, and, increased, consumption, even, at, relatively, low, levels, of, daily, intake, 2, beverages, for, women, and, 3, beverages, for, men, increases, health, and, mortality, risks, short, term, effects, of, alcohol, consumption, range, from, a, decrease, in, anxiety, and, motor, skills, and, euphoria, at, lower, doses, to, intoxication, drunkenness, to, stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde, amnesia, memory, blackouts, and, central, nervous, system, depression, at, higher, doses, cell, membranes, are, highly, permeable, to, alcohol, so, once, it, is, in, the, bloodstream, it, can, diffuse, into, nearly, every, cell, in, the, body, alcohol, can, greatly, exacerbate, sleep, problems, during, abstinence, residual, disruptions, in, sleep, regularity, and, sleep, patterns, are, the, greatest, predictors, of, relapse, long, term, use, can, lead, to, an, alcohol, use, disorder, an, increased, risk, of, developing, physical, dependence, cardiovascular, disease, and, several, types, of, cancer, some, nations, have, introduced, alcohol, packaging, warning, messages, that, inform, consumers, about, alcohol, and, cancer, as, well, as, fetal, alcohol, syndrome, the, addition, of, warning, labels, on, alcoholic, beverages, is, historically, supported, by, organizations, of, the, temperance, movement, such, as, the, woman, s, christian, temperance, union, as, well, as, by, medical, organisations, such, as, the, irish, cancer, society, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, lists, ethanol, as, a, carcinogen, and, states, that, there, is, sufficient, evidence, and, research, showing, the, carcinogenicity, of, acetaldehyde, the, major, metabolite, of, ethanol, which, is, excreted, by, the, liver, enzyme, when, one, drinks, alcohol, the, world, health, organization, also, considers, alcohol, to, be, a, carcinogen, with, no, quantity, of, consumption, considered, to, be, safe, who, estimates, nearly, half, of, alcohol, attributable, cancers, in, the, who, european, region, are, linked, to, light, or, moderate, drinking, defined, as, less, than, 1, 5, litres, of, wine, or, less, than, 3, 5, litres, of, beer, or, less, than, 450, millilitres, of, spirits, per,
