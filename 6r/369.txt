the, nhl, s, reserve, clause, to, be, illegal, thus, eliminating, the, elder, league, s, monopoly, over, the, players, seven, years, of, battling, for, players, and, markets, financially, damaged, both, leagues, leading, to, a, merger, agreement, in, 1979, that, saw, the, wha, cease, operations, while, the, nhl, absorbed, the, winnipeg, jets, the, edmonton, oilers, the, hartford, whalers, and, the, quebec, nordiques, the, owners, initially, rejected, this, merger, agreement, by, one, vote, but, a, massive, boycott, of, molson, brewery, products, by, canadian, fans, resulted, in, the,
