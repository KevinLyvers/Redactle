in, competitive, sports, doping, is, the, use, of, banned, athletic, performance, enhancing, drugs, peds, by, athletes, as, a, way, of, cheating, as, stated, in, the, world, anti, doping, code, by, wada, doping, is, defined, as, the, occurrence, of, one, or, more, of, the, anti, doping, rule, violations, outlined, in, article, 2, 1, through, article, 2, 11, of, the, code, the, term, doping, is, widely, used, by, organizations, that, regulate, sporting, competitions, the, use, of, drugs, to, enhance, performance, is, considered, unethical, and, is, prohibited, by, most, international, sports, organizations, including, the, international, olympic, committee, furthermore, athletes, or, athletic, programs, taking, explicit, measures, to, evade, detection, exacerbate, the, ethical, violation, with, overt, deception, and, cheating, the, origins, of, doping, in, sports, go, back, to, the, creation, of, the, sport, itself, from, ancient, usage, of, substances, in, chariot, racing, to, more, recent, controversies, in, doping, in, baseball, doping, in, tennis, doping, at, the, olympic, games, and, doping, at, the, tour, de, france, popular, views, among, athletes, have, varied, widely, from, country, to, country, over, the, years, the, general, trend, among, authorities, and, sporting, organizations, over, the, past, several, decades, has, been, to, regulate, the, use, of, drugs, in, sports, strictly, the, reasons, for, the, ban, are, mainly, the, health, risks, of, performance, enhancing, drugs, the, equality, of, opportunity, for, athletes, and, the, exemplary, effect, of, drug, free, sports, for, the, public, anti, doping, authorities, state, that, using, performance, enhancing, drugs, goes, against, the, spirit, of, sport, the, use, of, drugs, in, sports, goes, back, centuries, about, back, to, the, very, invention, of, the, concept, of, sports, in, ancient, times, when, the, fittest, of, a, nation, were, selected, as, athletes, or, combatants, they, were, fed, diets, and, given, treatments, considered, beneficial, to, help, increase, muscle, for, instance, scandinavian, mythology, says, berserkers, could, drink, a, mixture, called, butotens, to, greatly, improve, their, physical, power, at, the, risk, of, insanity, which, is, thought, to, have, been, prepared, using, the, amanita, muscaria, mushroom, the, ancient, olympics, in, greece, have, been, alleged, to, have, had, forms, of, doping, in, ancient, rome, where, chariot, racing, had, become, a, huge, part, of, their, culture, athletes, drank, herbal, infusions, to, strengthen, them, before, chariot, races, from, that, moment, people, started, to, introduce, their, specific, diets, to, improve, their, performance, lots, of, athletes, were, mainly, focusing, on, achieving, superiority, and, winning, the, competition, by, increasing, muscle, strength, capacity, and, endurance, charmis, the, spartan, winner, of, the, stade, race, in, the, olympic, games, of, 668bc, introduced, the, special, diet, of, consuming, enough, dried, figs, during, the, training, period, a, participant, in, an, endurance, walking, race, in, britain, abraham, wood, said, in, 1807, that, he, had, used, laudanum, which, contains, opiates, to, keep, him, awake, for, 24, hours, while, competing, against, robert, barclay, allardyce, by, april, 1877, walking, races, had, stretched, to, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, and, the, following, year, also, at, the, agricultural, hall, in, islington, london, to, 840, kilometres, 520, mi, the, illustrated, london, news, chided, the, event, proved, popular, however, with, 20, 000, spectators, attending, each, day, encouraged, the, promoters, developed, the, idea, and, soon, held, similar, races, for, cyclists, the, fascination, with, six, day, bicycle, races, spread, across, the, atlantic, and, appealed, to, the, crowds, in, america, as, well, and, the, more, spectators, paid, at, the, gate, the, higher, the, prizes, could, be, and, the, greater, was, the, incentive, of, riders, to, stay, awake, or, be, kept, awake, to, ride, the, greatest, distance, their, exhaustion, was, countered, by, soigneurs, the, french, word, for, healers, helpers, akin, to, seconds, in, boxing, among, the, treatments, they, supplied, was, nitroglycerine, a, drug, used, to, stimulate, the, heart, after, cardiac, attacks, and, which, was, credited, with, improving, riders, breathing, riders, had, hallucinations, from, the, exhaustion, and, perhaps, the, drugs, the, american, champion, major, taylor, refused, to, continue, the, new, york, race, saying, i, cannot, go, on, with, safety, for, there, is, a, man, chasing, me, around, the, ring, with, a, knife, in, his, hand, public, reaction, turned, against, such, trials, whether, individual, races, or, in, teams, of, two, one, report, said, the, father, of, anabolic, steroids, in, the, united, states, was, john, ziegler, 1917, 1983, a, physician, for, the, u, s, weightlifting, team, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, 1954, on, his, tour, to, vienna, with, his, team, for, the, world, championship, ziegler, learned, from, his, russian, colleague, that, the, soviet, weightlifting, team, s, success, was, due, to, their, use, of, testosterone, as, a, performance, enhancing, drug, deciding, that, u, s, athletes, needed, chemical, assistance, to, remain, competitive, ziegler, worked, with, the, ciba, pharmaceutical, company, to, develop, an, oral, anabolic, steroid, this, resulted, in, the, creation, of, methandrostenolone, which, appeared, on, the, market, in, 1960, under, the, brand, name, dianabol, during, the, olympics, that, year, the, danish, cyclist, knud, enemark, jensen, collapsed, and, died, while, competing, in, the, 100, kilometer, 62, mile, race, an, autopsy, later, revealed, the, presence, of, amphetamines, and, a, drug, called, nicotinyl, tartrate, in, his, system, the, american, specialist, in, doping, max, m, novich, wrote, trainers, of, the, old, school, who, supplied, treatments, which, had, cocaine, as, their, base, declared, with, assurance, that, a, rider, tired, by, a, six, day, race, would, get, his, second, breath, after, absorbing, these, mixtures, john, hoberman, a, professor, at, the, university, of, texas, in, austin, texas, said, six, day, races, were, de, facto, experiments, investigating, the, physiology, of, stress, as, well, as, the, substances, that, might, alleviate, exhaustion, over, 30, of, athletes, participating, in, 2011, world, championships, in, athletics, admitted, having, used, banned, substances, during, their, careers, according, to, a, study, commissioned, by, the, world, anti, doping, agency, wada, actually, 44, of, them, had, used, them, nevertheless, only, 0, 5, of, those, tested, were, caught, the, entire, russian, track, and, field, team, was, banned, from, the, 2016, olympic, games, as, the, russian, state, had, sponsored, and, essentially, sanctioned, their, doping, program, goldman, s, dilemma, or, the, goldman, dilemma, is, a, question, that, was, posed, to, elite, athletes, by, physician, osteopath, and, publicist, bob, goldman, asking, whether, they, would, take, a, drug, that, would, guarantee, them, success, in, sport, but, cause, them, to, die, after, five, years, in, his, research, as, in, previous, research, by, mirkin, approximately, half, the, athletes, responded, that, they, would, take, the, drug, but, modern, research, by, james, connor, and, co, workers, has, yielded, much, lower, numbers, with, athletes, having, levels, of, acceptance, of, the, dilemma, that, were, similar, to, the, general, population, of, australia, the, most, common, prohibited, substances, for, doping, in, sport, are, examples, of, well, known, stimulants, include, caffeine, cocaine, amphetamine, modafinil, and, ephedrine, caffeine, although, a, stimulant, has, not, been, banned, by, the, international, olympic, committee, or, the, world, anti, doping, agency, since, 2004, it, has, a, positive, effect, on, various, physical, parameters, most, of, all, endurance, but, also, on, velocity, strength, reaction, time, and, specific, actions, like, throwing, performance, other, ways, of, cheating, that, change, the, body, without, using, foreign, substances, include, injecting, one, s, own, red, blood, cells, as, done, with, doping, at, the, tour, de, france, treating, blood, with, uv, light, or, the, use, of, a, hyperbaric, chamber, not, currently, banned, and, potentially, gene, doping, anabolic, androgenic, steroids, aas, were, first, isolated, identified, and, synthesized, in, the, 1930s, and, are, now, used, therapeutically, in, medicine, to, induce, bone, growth, stimulate, appetite, induce, male, puberty, and, treat, chronic, wasting, conditions, such, as, cancer, and, aids, anabolic, steroids, also, increase, muscle, mass, and, physical, strength, and, are, therefore, used, in, sports, and, bodybuilding, to, enhance, strength, or, physique, known, side, effects, include, harmful, changes, in, cholesterol, levels, increased, low, density, lipoprotein, and, decreased, high, density, lipoprotein, acne, high, blood, pressure, and, liver, damage, some, of, these, effects, can, be, mitigated, by, taking, supplemental, drugs, aas, use, in, american, sports, began, in, october, 1954, when, john, ziegler, a, doctor, who, treated, american, athletes, went, to, vienna, with, the, american, weightlifting, team, there, he, met, a, russian, physician, who, over, a, few, drinks, repeatedly, asked, what, are, you, giving, your, boys, when, ziegler, returned, the, question, the, russian, said, that, his, own, athletes, were, being, given, testosterone, returning, to, america, ziegler, tried, low, doses, of, testosterone, on, himself, on, the, american, trainer, bob, hoffman, and, on, two, lifters, jim, park, and, yaz, kuzahara, all, gained, more, weight, and, strength, than, any, training, programme, would, produce, but, there, were, side, effects, ziegler, sought, a, drug, without, after, effects, and, hit, upon, the, anabolic, steroid, methandrostenolone, first, made, in, the, us, in, 1958, by, ciba, and, marketed, as, dianabol, colloquially, known, as, d, bol, the, results, were, so, impressive, that, lifters, began, taking, more, and, steroids, spread, to, other, sports, paul, lowe, a, former, running, back, with, the, san, diego, chargers, american, football, team, told, a, california, legislative, committee, on, drug, abuse, in, 1970, we, had, to, take, them, at, lunchtime, he, would, put, them, on, a, little, saucer, and, prescribed, them, for, us, to, take, them, and, if, not, he, would, suggest, there, might, be, a, fine, olympic, statistics, show, the, weight, of, shot, putters, increased, 14, percent, between, 1956, and, 1972, whereas, steeplechasers, weight, increased, 7, 6, percent, the, gold, medalist, pentathlete, mary, peters, said, a, medical, research, team, in, the, united, states, attempted, to, set, up, extensive, research, into, the, effects, of, steroids, on, weightlifters, and, throwers, only, to, discover, that, there, were, so, few, who, weren, t, taking, them, that, they, couldn, t, establish, any, worthwhile, comparisons, brand, name, dianabol, is, no, longer, produced, but, the, drug, methandrostenolone, itself, is, still, made, in, many, countries, and, other, similar, drugs, are, made, elsewhere, the, use, of, anabolic, steroids, is, now, banned, by, all, major, sporting, bodies, including, the, atp, wta, itf, international, olympic, committee, fifa, uefa, all, major, professional, golf, tours, the, national, hockey, league, major, league, baseball, the, national, basketball, association, the, european, athletic, association, wwe, the, nfl, and, the, uci, however, drug, testing, can, be, wildly, inconsistent, and, in, some, instances, has, gone, unenforced, a, number, of, studies, measuring, anabolic, steroid, use, in, high, school, athletes, found, that, out, of, all, 12th, grade, students, 6, 6, percent, of, them, had, used, anabolic, steroids, at, some, point, in, their, high, school, careers, or, were, approached, and, counseled, to, use, them, of, those, students, who, acknowledged, doping, with, anabolic, androgenic, steroids, well, over, half, participated, in, school, sponsored, athletics, including, football, wrestling, track, and, field, and, baseball, a, second, study, showed, 6, 3, percent, of, high, school, student, football, players, admitted, to, current, or, former, aas, use, at, the, collegiate, level, surveys, show, that, aas, use, among, athletes, range, from, 5, percent, to, 20, percent, and, continues, to, rise, the, study, found, that, skin, changes, were, an, early, marker, of, steroid, use, in, young, athletes, and, underscored, the, important, role, that, dermatologists, could, play, in, the, early, detection, and, intervention, in, these, athletes, there, are, two, different, types, of, controls, that, can, be, conducted, in, competition, or, in, training, it, is, important, that, tests, are, conducted, by, independent, organizations, that, treat, each, athlete, equally, indifferent, of, fame, or, nationality, a, famous, case, of, aas, use, in, a, competition, was, canadian, ben, johnson, s, victory, in, the, 100, m, at, the, 1988, summer, olympics, he, subsequently, failed, the, drug, test, when, stanozolol, was, found, in, his, urine, he, later, admitted, to, using, the, steroid, as, well, as, dianabol, testosterone, furazabol, and, human, growth, hormone, amongst, other, things, johnson, was, stripped, of, his, gold, medal, as, well, as, his, world, record, performance, carl, lewis, was, then, promoted, one, place, to, take, the, olympic, gold, title, lewis, had, also, run, under, the, current, world, record, time, and, was, therefore, recognized, as, the, new, record, holder, johnson, was, not, the, only, participant, whose, success, was, questioned, lewis, had, tested, positive, at, the, olympic, trials, for, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and, phenylpropanolamine, lewis, defended, himself, claiming, that, he, had, accidentally, consumed, the, banned, substances, after, the, supplements, that, he, had, taken, were, analyzed, to, prove, his, claims, the, usoc, accepted, his, claim, of, inadvertent, use, since, a, dietary, supplement, he, ingested, was, found, to, contain, ma, huang, the, chinese, name, for, ephedra, ephedrine, is, known, to, help, weight, loss, fellow, santa, monica, track, club, teammates, joe, deloach, and, floyd, heard, were, also, found, to, have, the, same, banned, stimulants, in, their, systems, and, were, cleared, to, compete, for, the, same, reason, the, highest, level, of, the, stimulants, lewis, recorded, was, 6, ppm, which, was, regarded, as, a, positive, test, in, 1988, now, it, is, regarded, as, negative, test, the, acceptable, level, has, been, raised, to, ten, parts, per, million, for, ephedrine, and, twenty, five, parts, per, million, for, other, substances, according, to, the, ioc, rules, at, the, time, positive, tests, with, levels, lower, than, 10, ppm, were, cause, of, further, investigation, but, not, immediate, ban, neal, benowitz, a, professor, of, medicine, at, uc, san, francisco, who, is, an, expert, on, ephedrine, and, other, stimulants, agreed, that, these, are, what, you, d, see, from, someone, taking, cold, or, allergy, medicines, and, are, unlikely, to, have, any, effect, on, performance, following, exum, s, revelations, the, iaaf, acknowledged, that, at, the, 1988, olympic, trials, the, usoc, indeed, followed, the, correct, procedures, in, dealing, with, eight, positive, findings, for, ephedrine, and, ephedrine, related, compounds, in, low, concentration, linford, christie, of, great, britain, was, found, to, have, metabolites, of, pseudoephedrine, in, his, urine, after, a, 200m, heat, at, the, same, olympics, but, was, later, cleared, of, any, wrongdoing, of, the, top, five, competitors, in, the, race, only, former, world, record, holder, and, eventual, bronze, medalist, calvin, smith, of, the, us, never, failed, a, drug, test, during, his, career, smith, later, said, i, should, have, been, the, gold, medalist, the, cbc, radio, documentary, rewind, ben, johnson, a, hero, disgraced, broadcast, on, 19, september, 2013, for, the, 25th, anniversary, of, the, race, stated, 20, athletes, tested, positive, for, drugs, but, were, cleared, by, the, ioc, at, this, 1988, seoul, olympics, an, ioc, official, stated, that, endocrine, profiles, done, at, those, games, indicated, that, 80, percent, of, the, track, and, field, athletes, tested, showed, evidence, of, long, term, steroid, use, although, not, all, were, banned, stimulants, are, drugs, that, usually, act, on, the, central, nervous, system, to, modulate, mental, function, and, behavior, increasing, an, individual, s, sense, of, excitement, decreasing, the, sensation, of, fatigue, and, improving, motor, coordination, the, latter, happens, via, improvement, of, the, interaction, between, nervous, system, and, musculature, it, has, greater, effect, when, an, athlete, is, already, exhausted, the, period, when, the, coordination, suffers, the, most, in, the, world, anti, doping, agency, list, of, prohibited, substances, stimulants, are, the, second, largest, class, after, the, anabolic, steroids, benzedrine, is, a, trade, name, for, amphetamine, the, council, of, europe, says, it, first, appeared, in, sport, at, the, berlin, olympics, in, 1936, it, was, produced, in, 1887, and, the, derivative, benzedrine, was, isolated, in, the, u, s, in, 1934, by, gordon, alles, its, perceived, effects, gave, it, the, street, name, speed, british, troops, used, 72, million, amphetamine, tablets, in, the, second, world, war, and, the, raf, got, through, so, many, that, methedrine, won, the, battle, of, britain, according, to, one, report, the, problem, was, that, amphetamine, leads, to, a, lack, of, judgement, and, a, willingness, to, take, risks, which, in, sport, could, lead, to, better, performances, but, in, fighters, and, bombers, led, to, more, crash, landings, than, the, raf, could, tolerate, the, drug, was, withdrawn, but, large, stocks, remained, on, the, black, market, amphetamine, was, also, used, legally, as, an, aid, to, slimming, and, also, as, a, thymoleptic, before, being, phased, out, by, the, appearance, of, newer, agents, in, the, 1950s, everton, one, of, the, top, clubs, in, the, english, football, league, were, champions, of, the, 1962, 63, season, and, it, was, done, according, to, a, national, newspaper, investigation, with, the, help, of, benzedrine, word, spread, after, everton, s, win, that, the, drug, had, been, involved, the, newspaper, investigated, cited, where, the, reporter, believed, it, had, come, from, and, quoted, the, goalkeeper, albert, dunlop, as, saying, the, club, agreed, that, drugs, had, been, used, but, that, they, could, not, possibly, have, had, any, harmful, effect, dunlop, however, said, he, had, become, an, addict, in, november, 1942, the, italian, cyclist, fausto, coppi, took, seven, packets, of, amphetamine, to, beat, the, world, hour, record, on, the, track, in, 1960, the, danish, rider, knud, enemark, jensen, collapsed, during, the, 100, km, team, time, trial, at, the, olympic, games, in, rome, and, died, later, in, hospital, the, autopsy, showed, he, had, taken, amphetamine, and, another, drug, ronicol, which, dilates, the, blood, vessels, the, chairman, of, the, dutch, cycling, federation, piet, van, dijk, said, of, rome, that, dope, whole, cartloads, used, in, such, royal, quantities, the, 1950s, british, cycling, professional, jock, andrews, would, joke, you, need, never, go, off, course, chasing, the, peloton, in, a, big, race, just, follow, the, trail, of, empty, syringes, and, dope, wrappers, the, dutch, cycling, team, manager, kees, pellenaars, told, of, a, rider, in, his, care, currently, modafinil, is, being, used, throughout, the, sporting, world, with, many, high, profile, cases, attracting, press, coverage, as, prominent, united, states, athletes, have, failed, tests, for, this, substance, some, athletes, who, were, found, to, have, used, modafinil, protested, as, the, drug, was, not, on, the, prohibited, list, at, the, time, of, their, offence, however, the, world, anti, doping, agency, wada, maintains, it, is, a, substance, related, to, those, already, banned, so, the, decisions, stand, modafinil, was, added, to, the, list, of, prohibited, substances, on, 3, august, 2004, ten, days, before, the, start, of, the, 2004, summer, olympics, one, approach, of, athletes, to, get, around, regulations, on, stimulants, is, to, use, new, designer, stimulants, which, have, not, previously, been, officially, prohibited, but, have, similar, chemical, structures, or, biological, effects, designer, stimulants, that, attracted, media, attention, in, 2010, included, mephedrone, ephedrone, and, fluoroamphetamines, which, have, chemical, structures, and, effects, similar, to, ephedrine, and, amphetamine, these, de, facto, experiments, investigating, the, physiology, of, stress, as, well, as, the, substances, that, might, alleviate, exhaustion, were, not, unknown, outside, cycling, thomas, hicks, an, american, born, in, england, on, 7, january, 1875, won, the, olympic, marathon, in, 1904, he, crossed, the, line, behind, a, fellow, american, fred, lorz, who, had, been, transported, for, 11, miles, of, the, course, by, his, trainer, leading, to, his, disqualification, however, hicks, s, trainer, charles, lucas, pulled, out, a, syringe, and, came, to, his, aid, as, his, runner, began, to, struggle, the, use, of, strychnine, at, the, time, was, thought, necessary, to, survive, demanding, races, according, to, sports, historians, alain, lunzenfichter, and, historian, of, sports, doping, dr, jean, pierre, de, mondenard, who, said, hicks, was, in, the, phrase, of, the, time, between, life, and, death, but, recovered, collected, his, gold, medal, a, few, days, later, and, lived, until, 1952, nonetheless, he, never, again, took, part, in, athletics, in, 1977, one, of, east, germany, s, best, sprinters, renate, neufeld, fled, to, the, west, with, the, bulgarian, she, later, married, a, year, later, she, said, that, she, had, been, told, to, take, drugs, supplied, by, coaches, while, training, to, represent, east, germany, at, the, 1980, summer, olympics, she, brought, with, her, to, the, west, grey, tablets, and, green, powder, she, said, had, been, given, to, her, to, members, of, her, club, and, to, other, athletes, the, west, german, doping, analyst, manfred, donike, reportedly, identified, them, as, anabolic, steroids, she, said, she, stayed, quiet, for, a, year, for, the, sake, of, her, family, but, when, her, father, then, lost, his, job, and, her, sister, was, expelled, from, her, handball, club, she, decided, to, tell, her, story, east, germany, closed, itself, to, the, sporting, world, in, may, 1965, in, 1977, the, shot, putter, ilona, slupianek, who, weighed, 93, kg, failed, a, test, for, anabolic, steroids, at, the, european, cup, meeting, in, helsinki, and, thereafter, athletes, were, tested, before, they, left, the, country, at, the, same, time, the, kreischa, testing, laboratory, near, dresden, passed, into, government, control, it, reputedly, made, around, 12, 000, tests, a, year, on, east, german, athletes, but, without, any, being, penalised, the, international, amateur, athletics, federation, iaaf, suspended, slupianek, for, 12, months, a, penalty, that, ended, two, days, before, the, european, championships, in, prague, in, the, reverse, of, what, the, iaaf, hoped, sending, her, home, to, east, germany, meant, she, was, free, to, train, unchecked, with, anabolic, steroids, if, she, wanted, to, and, then, compete, for, another, gold, medal, which, she, won, after, that, almost, nothing, emerged, from, the, east, german, sports, schools, and, laboratories, a, rare, exception, was, the, visit, by, the, sports, writer, and, former, athlete, doug, gilbert, of, the, edmonton, sun, who, said, other, reports, came, from, the, occasional, athlete, who, fled, to, the, west, 15, of, them, between, 1976, and, 1979, one, the, ski, jumper, hans, georg, aschenbach, said, long, distance, skiers, start, having, injections, to, their, knees, from, the, age, 14, because, of, their, intensive, training, he, said, for, every, olympic, champion, there, are, at, least, 350, invalids, there, are, gymnasts, among, the, girls, who, have, to, wear, corsets, from, the, age, of, 18, because, their, spine, and, their, ligaments, have, become, so, worn, there, are, young, people, so, worn, out, by, the, intensive, training, that, they, come, out, of, it, mentally, blank, which, is, even, more, painful, than, a, deformed, spine, after, the, 1990, german, reunification, on, 26, august, 1993, the, records, were, opened, and, evidence, found, that, the, stasi, the, state, secret, police, supervised, systematic, doping, of, east, german, athletes, from, 1971, until, reunification, in, 1990, doping, existed, in, other, countries, says, the, expert, jean, pierre, de, mondenard, both, communist, and, capitalist, but, the, difference, with, east, germany, was, that, it, was, a, state, policy, the, sportvereinigung, dynamo, english, dynamo, sports, club, was, especially,

of, voetbal, myseries, who, wrote, that, players, consumed, tons, of, amphetamines, an, investigative, commission, of, sports, medicine, in, freiburg, claims, that, in, the, late, 1970s, and, in, the, 1980s, stuttgart, and, freiburg, football, clubs, were, operating, with, anabolika, vfb, stuttgart, reordered, anabolika, at, least, once, in, 1987, toni, schumacher, wrote, about, a, long, running, tradition, of, doping, in, the, bundesliga, claiming, that, lots, of, players, were, taking, captagon, he, himself, experimented, with, it, and, the, effects, were, increased, aggression, lower, pain, threshold, increased, focus, confidence, and, endurance, the, by, effect, was, sleeping, problems, in, k, ln, he, was, chauffeuring, his, colleagues, to, the, doctor, who, gave, them, pills, and, injections, presumably, anabolics, and, stimulants, in, the, national, team, he, mentioned, a, walking, chemist, and, hormone, use, despite, being, supported, by, paul, breitner, he, had, to, leave, k, ln, after, 544, games, later, on, his, statements, about, doping, in, the, bundesliga, were, supported, by, per, roentved, hans, werner, moors, dieter, schatzscheider, hans, josef, kapellmann, peter, neururer, benno, m, hlmann, uwe, nester, peter, geyer, who, talked, about, procedure, quantity, and, side, effects, j, rgen, r, ber, j, rgen, stumm, and, peter, harms, both, medics, juventus, won, the, 1996, uefa, champions, league, final, but, the, victory, remains, controversial, because, of, accusations, of, doping, the, juventus, team, has, been, accused, of, using, erythropoietin, epo, and, the, matter, went, to, trial, in, 2004, in, november, 2004, club, doctor, riccardo, agricola, was, given, a, 22, month, prison, sentence, and, fined, 2, 000, for, sporting, fraud, by, providing, performance, enhancing, drugs, specifically, epo, to, players, between, 1994, and, 1998, leading, hematologist, giuseppe, d, onofrio, said, that, it, was, practically, certain, that, midfielders, antonio, conte, and, alessio, tacchinardi, had, taken, epo, to, overcome, brief, bouts, of, anemia, and, that, it, was, very, probable, that, seven, other, players, alessandro, birindelli, alessandro, del, piero, didier, deschamps, dimas, paolo, montero, gianluca, pessotto, and, moreno, torricelli, had, taken, epo, in, small, doses, in, april, 2005, the, court, of, arbitration, for, sport, gave, the, following, advisory, opinion, in, part, the, use, of, pharmaceutical, substances, which, are, not, expressly, prohibited, by, sports, law, and, which, cannot, be, considered, as, substances, similar, or, related, to, those, expressly, prohibited, is, not, to, be, sanctioned, by, disciplinary, measures, however, regardless, of, the, existence, or, not, of, any, judgement, rendered, by, a, state, court, sports, authorities, are, under, the, obligation, to, prosecute, the, use, of, pharmaceutical, substances, which, are, prohibited, by, sports, law, or, any, other, anti, doping, rule, violation, in, order, to, adopt, disciplinary, measures, in, december, 2005, agricola, was, acquitted, of, the, charges, by, turin, s, court, of, appeal, in, march, 2007, in, the, final, verdict, by, the, supreme, court, of, cassation, stated, that, in, the, years, of, 1994, to, 1998, there, was, no, ascertained, positive, case, of, doping, substances, by, juventus, players, that, the, purchase, of, erythropoietin, or, its, administration, to, the, athletes, of, the, club, does, not, emerge, from, any, act, of, the, trial, and, that, the, same, expert, had, identified, the, possibility, of, an, administration, of, erythropoietin, in, distant, terms, from, the, sure, evidence, very, probable, and, in, two, cases, practically, certain, it, is, that, therefore, the, judgement, of, probability, and, not, of, certainty, did, not, allow, for, a, statement, of, responsibility, the, verdict, also, went, on, to, say, in, response, to, the, conclusion, taken, the, territorial, court, notes, that, there, were, no, deferred, values, higher, than, the, limits, set, in, the, various, antidoping, protocols, and, that, the, situation, of, the, juventus, players, both, with, reference, to, the, average, hematological, values, and, in, relation, to, that, of, material, balance, did, not, differ, from, the, national, average, population, at, olympique, marseille, doping, also, took, place, according, to, marcel, desailly, jean, jaques, eydelie, chris, waddle, and, tony, cascarino, they, told, about, stimulants, taken, prior, to, their, big, games, which, made, them, more, energetic, and, keen, according, to, eydelie, all, of, them, took, a, series, of, injections, in, the, champions, league, final, 1993, except, rudi, v, ller, all, this, was, no, surprise, for, arsene, wenger, who, said, everyone, in, france, assumed, something, like, that, going, on, additionally, desailly, and, cascarino, claimed, that, bernard, tapie, the, president, himself, distributed, pills, and, injections, author, mondenard, also, mentioned, injections, for, everyone, tapie, only, admitted, that, some, players, took, captagon, in, 2001, a, couple, of, players, tested, positive, for, nandrolone, 2013, it, had, been, announced, that, fuentes, received, up, to, 327, 000, annually, from, real, sociedad, this, was, detected, by, auditors, from, ernst, young, at, the, behest, of, i, aki, badiola, president, of, the, club, in, 2008, the, documentation, of, the, doctor, also, contained, the, inscriptions, rsoc, a, couple, of, times, and, cuentas, asti, which, most, probably, stands, for, astiazar, n, president, of, the, club, from, 2000, to, 2005, in, 2003, real, sociedad, finished, second, in, the, spanish, league, missing, the, title, by, two, points, the, well, known, medic, was, hired, by, real, madrid, and, fc, barcelona, too, according, to, le, monde, they, had, access, to, confidential, documents, like, training, schedules, in, december, 2013, the, ufc, began, a, campaign, to, drug, test, their, entire, roster, randomly, all, year, round, random, testing, however, became, problematic, for, the, promotion, as, it, began, to, affect, revenue, as, fighters, who, had, tested, positive, would, need, to, be, taken, out, of, fights, which, adversely, affected, fight, cards, and, therefore, pay, per, view, sales, if, the, ufc, were, not, able, to, find, a, replacement, fighter, fights, would, have, to, be, cancelled, according, to, steven, marrocco, of, mmajunkie, com, about, 31, of, ufc, fighters, subjected, to, random, testing, since, the, program, first, started, have, failed, due, to, using, performance, enhancing, drugs, that, is, approximately, five, failed, tests, for, every, sixteen, random, screenings, from, july, 2015, the, ufc, has, advocated, to, all, commissions, that, every, fighter, be, tested, in, competition, for, every, card, lorenzo, feritta, who, at, the, time, was, one, of, the, presidents, of, the, ufc, said, we, want, 100, percent, of, the, fighters, tested, the, night, they, compete, also, in, addition, to, the, drug, testing, protocols, in, place, for, competitors, on, fight, night, the, ufc, conducts, additional, testing, for, main, event, fighters, or, any, fighters, that, are, due, to, compete, in, championship, matches, this, includes, enhanced, random, out, of, competition, testing, for, performance, enhancing, drugs, with, both, urine, and, blood, samples, being, taken, the, ufc, also, announced, that, all, potential, ufc, signees, would, be, subject, to, mandatory, pre, contract, screening, for, performance, enhancing, drugs, prior, to, being, offered, a, contract, with, the, promotion, the, use, of, performance, enhancing, drugs, in, sport, has, become, an, increasing, problem, across, a, wide, range, of, sports, it, is, defined, as, any, substance, or, drug, that, when, taken, gives, an, athlete, an, unfair, advantage, relative, to, a, clean, athlete, the, banning, of, these, drugs, promotes, a, level, playing, field, and, equality, among, athletes, the, use, of, the, suit, in, swimming, which, gives, athletes, an, advantage, in, the, way, of, hydrodynamics, has, been, banned, from, international, competition, due, to, the, unfair, advantage, it, delivered, the, drugs, taken, by, athletes, differ, widely, based, on, the, performance, needs, of, the, sport, erythropoietin, epo, is, largely, taken, by, endurance, athletes, who, seek, a, higher, level, of, red, blood, cells, which, leads, to, more, oxygenated, blood, and, a, higher, vo2, max, an, athlete, s, vo2, max, is, highly, correlated, with, success, within, endurance, sports, such, as, swimming, long, distance, running, cycling, rowing, and, cross, country, skiing, epo, has, recently, become, prevalent, amongst, endurance, athletes, due, to, its, potency, and, low, degree, of, detectability, when, compared, to, other, methods, of, doping, such, as, blood, transfusion, while, epo, is, believed, to, have, been, widely, used, by, athletes, in, the, 1990s, there, was, not, a, way, to, directly, test, for, the, drug, until, 2002, as, there, was, no, specific, screening, process, to, test, athletes, athletes, at, the, olympic, games, are, tested, for, epo, through, blood, and, urine, tests, stringent, guidelines, and, regulations, can, lessen, the, danger, of, doping, that, has, existed, within, some, endurance, sports, in, 1924, a, journalist, albert, londres, followed, the, tour, de, france, for, the, french, newspaper, le, petit, parisien, at, coutances, he, heard, that, the, previous, year, s, winner, henri, p, lissier, his, brother, francis, and, a, third, rider, maurice, ville, had, resigned, from, the, competition, after, an, argument, with, the, organiser, henri, desgrange, p, lissier, explained, the, problem, whether, or, not, he, had, the, right, to, take, off, a, jersey, and, went, on, to, talk, of, drugs, reported, in, londres, race, diary, in, which, he, invented, the, phrase, les, for, ats, de, la, route, the, convicts, of, the, road, henri, spoke, of, being, as, white, as, shrouds, once, the, dirt, of, the, day, had, been, washed, off, then, of, their, bodies, being, drained, by, diarrhea, before, continuing, francis, p, lissier, said, much, later, londres, was, a, famous, reporter, but, he, didn, t, know, about, cycling, we, kidded, him, a, bit, with, our, cocaine, and, our, pills, even, so, the, tour, de, france, in, 1924, was, no, picnic, the, acceptance, of, drug, taking, in, the, tour, de, france, was, so, complete, by, 1930, when, the, race, changed, to, national, teams, that, were, to, be, paid, for, by, the, organisers, that, the, rule, book, distributed, to, riders, by, the, organiser, henri, desgrange, reminded, them, that, drugs, were, not, among, items, with, which, they, would, be, provided, the, use, of, pot, belge, by, road, cyclists, in, continental, europe, exemplifies, a, cross, over, between, recreational, and, performance, enhancing, abuse, of, drugs, by, sportsman, in, 1998, the, entire, festina, team, were, excluded, from, the, tour, de, france, following, the, discovery, of, a, team, car, containing, large, amounts, of, various, performance, enhancing, drugs, the, team, director, later, admitted, that, some, of, the, cyclists, were, routinely, given, banned, substances, six, other, teams, pulled, out, in, protest, including, dutch, team, tvm, who, left, the, tour, still, being, questioned, by, the, police, the, festina, scandal, overshadowed, cyclist, marco, pantani, s, tour, win, but, he, himself, later, failed, a, test, the, infamous, pot, belge, or, belgian, mix, has, a, decades, long, history, in, pro, cycling, among, both, riders, and, support, staff, david, millar, the, 2003, world, time, trial, champion, admitted, using, epo, and, was, stripped, of, his, title, and, suspended, for, two, years, roberto, heras, was, stripped, of, his, victory, in, the, 2005, vuelta, a, espa, a, and, suspended, for, two, years, after, testing, positive, for, epo, floyd, landis, was, the, initial, winner, of, the, 2006, tour, de, france, but, a, urine, sample, taken, from, landis, immediately, after, his, stage, 17, win, has, twice, tested, positive, for, banned, synthetic, testosterone, as, well, as, a, ratio, of, testosterone, to, epitestosterone, nearly, three, times, the, limit, allowed, by, world, anti, doping, agency, rules, the, international, cycling, union, stripped, him, of, his, 2006, tour, de, france, title, second, place, finisher, scar, pereiro, was, officially, declared, the, winner, lance, armstrong, was, world, number, one, in, 1996, in, the, same, year, he, recovered, from, severe, testicular, cancer, and, continued, to, break, records, and, win, his, seventh, tour, de, france, in, 2005, after, beating, cancer, and, breaking, records, he, was, accused, of, doping, teammates, of, lance, had, been, caught, taking, epo, erythropoietin, which, made, the, accusations, against, armstrong, stronger, on, 22, october, 2012, lance, armstrong, was, officially, stripped, of, his, tour, de, france, titles, since, 1, august, 1998, as, a, response, to, the, decisions, of, the, usada, and, uci, armstrong, resigned, from, the, lance, armstrong, foundation, he, later, admitted, to, doping, in, an, interview, with, oprah, winfrey, in, triathlon, 2004, hawaii, ironman, winner, nina, kraft, was, disqualified, for, a, positive, test, to, epo, she, remains, the, only, hawaii, ironman, winner, to, be, disqualified, for, doping, offences, sports, lawyer, michelle, gallen, has, said, that, the, pursuit, of, doping, athletes, has, turned, into, a, modern, day, witch, hunt, in, sports, where, physical, strength, is, favored, athletes, have, used, anabolic, steroids, known, for, their, ability, to, increase, physical, strength, and, muscle, mass, the, drugs, mimic, the, effect, of, testosterone, and, dihydrotestosterone, in, the, body, they, were, developed, after, eastern, bloc, countries, demonstrated, success, in, weightlifting, during, the, 1940s, at, the, time, they, were, using, testosterone, which, carried, with, it, negative, side, effects, and, anabolic, steroids, were, developed, as, a, solution, the, drugs, have, been, used, across, a, wide, range, of, sports, from, football, and, basketball, to, weightlifting, and, track, and, field, while, not, as, life, threatening, as, the, drugs, used, in, endurance, sports, anabolic, steroids, have, negative, side, effects, including, in, countries, where, the, use, of, these, drugs, is, controlled, there, is, often, a, black, market, trade, of, smuggled, or, counterfeit, drugs, the, quality, of, these, drugs, may, be, poor, and, can, cause, health, risks, in, countries, where, anabolic, steroids, are, strictly, regulated, some, have, called, for, regulatory, relief, anabolic, steroids, are, available, over, the, counter, in, some, countries, such, as, thailand, and, mexico, sports, that, are, members, of, the, ioc, also, enforce, drug, regulations, for, example, bridge, many, sports, organizations, have, banned, the, use, of, performance, enhancing, drugs, and, have, very, strict, rules, and, penalties, for, people, who, are, caught, using, them, the, international, amateur, athletic, federation, now, world, athletics, was, the, first, international, governing, body, of, sport, to, take, the, situation, seriously, in, 1928, they, banned, participants, from, doping, but, with, little, in, the, way, of, testing, available, they, had, to, rely, on, the, word, of, the, athlete, that, they, were, clean, it, was, not, until, 1966, that, fifa, and, union, cycliste, internationale, cycling, joined, the, iaaf, in, the, fight, against, drugs, followed, by, the, international, olympic, committee, the, following, year, progression, in, pharmacology, has, always, outstripped, the, ability, of, sports, federations, to, implement, rigorous, testing, procedures, but, since, the, creation, of, the, world, anti, doping, agency, in, 1999, it, has, become, more, effective, to, catch, athletes, who, use, drugs, the, first, tests, for, athletes, were, at, the, 1966, european, championships, and, two, years, later, the, ioc, implemented, their, first, drug, tests, at, both, the, summer, and, winter, olympics, anabolic, steroids, became, prevalent, during, the, 1970s, and, after, a, method, of, detection, was, found, they, were, added, to, the, ioc, s, prohibited, substances, list, in, 1975, after, which, the, 1976, summer, olympics, in, montreal, were, the, first, olympic, games, which, tested, for, them, over, the, years, different, sporting, bodies, have, evolved, differently, in, the, struggle, against, doping, some, such, as, athletics, and, cycling, are, becoming, increasingly, vigilant, against, doping, however, there, has, been, criticism, that, sports, such, as, football, soccer, and, baseball, are, doing, nothing, about, the, issue, and, letting, athletes, implicated, in, doping, get, away, unpunished, some, commentators, maintain, that, as, outright, prevention, of, doping, is, an, impossibility, all, doping, should, be, legalised, however, most, disagree, with, this, pointing, out, the, claimed, harmful, long, term, effects, of, many, doping, agents, opponents, claim, that, with, doping, legal, all, competitive, athletes, would, be, compelled, to, use, drugs, and, the, net, effect, would, be, a, level, playing, field, but, with, widespread, health, consequences, a, common, rebuttal, to, this, argument, asserts, that, anti, doping, efforts, have, been, largely, ineffective, due, to, both, testing, limitations, and, lack, of, enforcement, and, so, sanctioned, steroid, use, would, not, be, markedly, different, from, the, situation, already, in, existence, another, point, of, view, is, that, doping, could, be, legalized, to, some, extent, using, a, drug, whitelist, and, medical, counseling, such, that, medical, safety, is, ensured, with, all, usage, published, under, such, a, system, it, is, likely, that, athletes, would, attempt, to, cheat, by, exceeding, official, limits, to, try, to, gain, an, advantage, this, could, be, considered, conjecture, as, drug, amounts, do, not, always, correlate, linearly, with, performance, gains, social, pressure, is, one, of, the, factors, that, leads, to, doping, in, sport, the, media, and, society, work, together, to, construct, a, view, of, what, masculinity, and, femininity, should, look, like, adolescent, athletes, are, constantly, influenced, by, what, they, see, on, the, media, and, some, go, to, extreme, measures, to, achieve, the, ideal, image, since, society, channels, judith, butler, s, definition, of, gender, as, a, performative, act, examples, of, social, pressures, were, given, in, a, study, done, on, an, online, bodybuilding, community, where, bodybuilders, doped, because, they, felt, like, it, was, a, rite, of, passage, to, be, accepted, into, the, community, and, to, feel, validated, both, men, and, women, are, being, materialized, in, the, context, of, doping, in, sport, in, an, interview, involving, 140, men, it, was, concluded, that, bodily, practices, are, essential, for, masculine, identity, and, it, was, determined, that, the, media, highly, publicizes, female, athletes, who, were, strong, and, thin, this, leads, to, the, issue, of, the, consumption, of, performance, enhancement, drugs, to, achieve, muscular, or, thin, figures, and, the, assumption, that, the, opponents, are, also, taking, performance, enhancing, drugs, deeming, it, as, an, acceptable, behavior, to, conform, to, in, addition, society, s, embracement, of, the, winning, is, everything, spirit, leads, many, athletes, to, participate, in, doping, hoping, that, they, will, not, be, caught, elite, athletes, have, financial, competitive, motivations, that, cause, them, to, dope, and, these, motivations, differ, from, that, of, recreational, athletes, the, common, theme, among, these, motivations, is, the, pressure, to, physically, perform, in, a, study, of, 101, individuals, 86, responded, that, their, use, of, performance, enhancement, drugs, were, influenced, by, the, potential, athletic, success, 74, by, the, economic, aspect, and, 30, by, self, confidence, and, social, recognition, related, reasons, in, another, study, of, 40, people, it, was, concluded, that, athletes, used, performance, enhancement, drugs, for, healing, purposes, so, that, they, were, an, able, competitor, for, the, economic, rewards, involved, with, elite, sports, physical, pressures, often, overlap, with, social, pressures, to, have, a, certain, body, build, this, is, the, case, with, muscle, dysmorphia, where, an, athlete, wants, a, more, muscular, physique, for, functionality, and, self, image, purposes, the, most, popular, motive, for, athletes, to, take, supplements, is, to, prevent, any, nutrient, deficiencies, and, to, strengthen, the, immune, system, these, factors, all, focus, on, improving, the, body, for, performance, psychology, is, another, factor, to, take, into, consideration, in, doping, in, sport, it, becomes, a, behavioral, issue, when, the, athlete, acknowledges, the, health, risks, associated, with, doping, yet, participates, in, it, anyway, this, has, to, do, with, the, psychological, thinking, that, the, drug, will, make, one, feel, invincible, the, individuals, are, very, egotistic, in, their, way, of, thinking, and, their, motivation, is, dependent, on, the, performance, enhancement, drug, since, they, believe, that, it, delivers, the, results, on, a, study, on, health, psychology, quirk, points, out, three, different, psychological, aspects, that, lead, one, to, dope, social, cognition, stress, and, strain, and, addiction, the, social, and, physical, pressures, can, alter, an, athlete, s, way, of, thinking, leading, them, to, believe, that, they, must, take, performance, enhancement, drugs, since, everyone, else, is, doing, it, known, as, the, doping, dilemma, this, also, causes, athletes, to, be, hesitant, to, consult, with, a, doctor, about, their, steroid, use, putting, themselves, at, more, risk, with, health, problems, under, established, doping, control, protocols, the, athlete, will, be, asked, to, provide, a, urine, sample, which, will, be, divided, into, two, each, portion, to, be, preserved, within, sealed, containers, bearing, the, same, unique, identifying, number, and, designation, respectively, as, a, and, b, samples, an, athlete, whose, a, sample, has, tested, positive, for, a, prohibited, substance, is, requested, an, analysis, of, his, or, her, b, sample, after, a, confirmation, test, on, sample, a, that, delivered, the, same, results, if, the, b, sample, test, results, match, the, a, sample, results, then, the, athlete, is, considered, to, have, a, positive, test, otherwise, the, test, results, are, negative, this, confirmation, process, ensures, the, safety, of, the, individual, see, also, blood, doping, the, blood, test, detects, illegal, performance, enhancement, drugs, through, the, measurement, of, indicators, that, change, with, the, use, of, recombinant, human, erythropoietin, the, gas, chromatography, combustion, irms, is, a, way, to, detect, any, variations, in, the, isotopic, composition, of, an, organic, compound, from, the, standard, this, test, is, used, to, detect, whether, or, not, synthetic, testosterone, was, consumed, leading, to, an, increased, abnormal, testosterone, epitestosterone, t, e, level, assumptions, the, lower, the, 13, c, to, 12, c, ratio, the, more, likely, that, synthetic, testosterone, was, used, the, athlete, biological, passport, is, a, program, that, tracks, the, location, of, an, athlete, to, combat, doping, in, sports, this, means, that, the, athlete, can, be, monitored, and, drug, tested, wherever, they, are, and, this, data, can, be, compared, to, the, history, of, their, doping, test, results, there, is, an, ongoing, discussion, about, how, this, measure, can, be, seen, as, a, violation, of, an, individual, s, privacy, according, to, article, 6, 5, in, the, world, anti, doping, code, samples, may, be, retested, later, samples, from, high, profile, events, such, as, the, olympic, games, are, now, retested, up, to, eight, years, later, to, take, advantage, of, new, techniques, for, detecting, banned, substances, athletes, seeking, to, avoid, testing, positive, use, various, methods, the, most, common, methods, include, donald, berry, writing, in, the, journal, nature, has, called, attention, to, potential, problems, with, the, validity, of, ways, in, which, many, of, the, standardised, tests, are, performed, in, his, article, as, described, in, an, accompanying, editorial, berry, argues, that, anti, doping, authorities, have, not, adequately, defined, and, publicized, how, they, arrived, at, the, criteria, used, to, determine, whether, or, not, a, test, result, is, positive, calibrated, in, part, by, testing, a, small, number, of, volunteers, taking, the, substance, in, question, that, individual, labs, need, to, verify, these, detection, limits, in, larger, groups, that, include, known, dopers, and, non, dopers, under, blinded, conditions, that, mimic, what, happens, during, competition, the, editorial, closes, saying, nature, believes, that, accepting, legal, limits, of, specific, metabolites, without, such, rigorous, verification, goes, against, the, foundational, standards, of, modern, science, and, results, in, an, arbitrary, test, for, which, the, rate, of, false, positives, and, false,
