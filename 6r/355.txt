and, high, scoring, the, sport, s, origins, can, be, traced, to, football, matches, played, in, melbourne, in, 1858, inspired, by, english, public, school, football, games, seeking, to, develop, a, game, more, suited, to, adults, and, australian, conditions, the, melbourne, football, club, published, the, first, laws, of, australian, football, in, may, 1859, australian, football, has, the, highest, spectator, attendance, and, television, viewership, of, all, sports, in, australia, while, the, australian, football, league, afl, the, sport, s, only, fully, professional, competition, is, the, nation, s, wealthiest, sporting, body, the, afl, grand, final, held, annually, at, the, melbourne, cricket, ground, is, the, second, highest, attended, club, championship, event, in, the, world, the, sport, is, also, played, at, amateur, level, in, many, countries, and, in, several, variations, its, rules, are, governed, by, the, afl, commission, with, the, advice, of, the, afl, s, laws, of, the, game, committee, australian, rules, football, is, known, by, several, nicknames, including, aussie, rules, football, and, footy, in, some, regions, where, other, codes, of, football, are, more, popular, the, sport, is, most, often, called, afl, after, the, australian, football, league, while, the, league, itself, also, uses, this, name, for, local, competitions, in, some, areas, primitive, forms, of, football, were, played, sporadically, in, the, australian, colonies, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, compared, to, cricket, and, horse, racing, football, was, considered, a, mere, amusement, by, colonists, at, the, time, and, while, little, is, known, about, these, early, one, off, games, evidence, does, not, support, a, causal, link, with, australian, football, in, melbourne, in, 1858, in, a, move, that, would, help, to, shape, australian, football, in, its, formative, years, private, schools, then, termed, public, schools, in, accordance, with, nomenclature, in, england, began, organising, football, games, inspired, by, precedents, at, english, public, schools, the, earliest, match, held, on, 15, june, was, between, melbourne, grammar, and, st, kilda, grammar, on, 10, july, 1858, the, melbourne, based, bell, s, life, in, victoria, and, sporting, chronicle, published, a, letter, by, tom, wills, captain, of, the, victoria, cricket, team, calling, for, the, formation, of, a, foot, ball, club, with, a, code, of, laws, to, keep, cricketers, fit, during, winter, born, in, australia, wills, played, a, nascent, form, of, rugby, football, while, a, pupil, at, rugby, school, in, england, and, returned, to, his, homeland, a, star, athlete, and, cricketer, two, weeks, later, wills, friend, cricketer, jerry, bryant, posted, an, advertisement, for, a, scratch, match, at, the, richmond, paddock, adjoining, the, melbourne, cricket, ground, mcg, this, was, the, first, of, several, kickabouts, held, that, year, involving, members, of, the, melbourne, cricket, club, including, wills, bryant, w, j, hammersley, and, j, b, thompson, trees, were, used, as, goalposts, and, play, typically, lasted, an, entire, afternoon, without, an, agreed, upon, code, of, laws, some, players, were, guided, by, rules, they, had, learned, in, the, british, isles, others, by, no, rules, at, all, another, milestone, in, 1858, was, a, 40, a, side, match, played, under, experimental, rules, between, melbourne, grammar, and, scotch, college, held, at, the, richmond, paddock, umpired, by, wills, and, teacher, john, macadam, it, began, on, 7, august, and, continued, over, two, subsequent, saturdays, ending, in, a, draw, with, each, side, kicking, one, goal, it, is, commemorated, with, a, statue, outside, the, mcg, and, the, two, schools, have, since, competed, annually, in, the, cordner, eggleston, cup, the, world, s, oldest, continuous, football, competition, since, the, 1920s, it, has, been, suggested, that, australian, football, may, have, been, derived, from, the, irish, sport, of, gaelic, football, however, there, is, no, archival, evidence, in, favour, of, a, gaelic, influence, and, the, style, of, play, shared, between, the, two, modern, codes, appeared, in, australia, long, before, the, irish, game, evolved, in, a, similar, direction, another, theory, first, proposed, in, 1983, posits, that, wills, having, grown, up, among, aboriginals, in, victoria, may, have, seen, or, played, the, aboriginal, ball, game, of, marn, grook, and, incorporated, some, of, its, features, into, early, australian, football, there, is, only, circumstantial, evidence, that, he, knew, of, the, game, and, according, to, biographer, greg, de, moore, s, research, wills, was, almost, solely, influenced, by, his, experience, at, rugby, school, a, loosely, organised, melbourne, side, captained, by, wills, played, against, other, football, enthusiasts, in, the, winter, and, spring, of, 1858, the, following, year, on, 14, may, the, melbourne, football, club, was, officially, established, making, it, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, football, clubs, three, days, later, wills, hammersley, thompson, and, teacher, thomas, h, smith, met, near, the, mcg, at, the, parade, hotel, owned, by, bryant, and, drafted, ten, rules, the, rules, of, the, melbourne, football, club, these, are, the, laws, from, which, australian, football, evolved, the, club, aimed, to, create, a, simple, code, suited, to, the, hard, playing, surfaces, around, melbourne, and, to, eliminate, the, roughest, aspects, of, english, school, games, such, as, hacking, shin, kicking, in, rugby, school, football, to, reduce, the, risk, of, injuries, to, working, men, in, another, significant, departure, from, english, public, school, football, the, melbourne, rules, omitted, any, offside, law, the, new, code, was, as, much, a, reaction, against, the, school, games, as, influenced, by, them, writes, mark, pennings, the, rules, were, distributed, throughout, the, colony, thompson, in, particular, did, much, to, promote, the, new, code, in, his, capacity, as, a, journalist, following, melbourne, s, lead, geelong, and, melbourne, university, also, formed, football, clubs, in, 1859, while, many, early, victorian, teams, participated, in, one, off, matches, most, had, not, yet, formed, clubs, for, regular, competition, a, south, yarra, club, devised, its, own, rules, to, ensure, the, supremacy, of, the, melbourne, rules, the, first, club, level, competition, in, australia, the, caledonian, society, s, challenge, cup, 1861, 64, stipulated, that, only, the, melbourne, rules, were, to, be, used, this, law, was, reinforced, by, the, athletic, sports, committee, asc, which, ran, a, variation, of, the, challenge, cup, in, 1865, 66, with, input, from, other, clubs, the, rules, underwent, several, minor, revisions, establishing, a, uniform, code, known, as, victorian, rules, in, 1866, the, first, distinctively, victorian, rule, the, running, bounce, was, formalised, at, a, meeting, of, club, delegates, chaired, by, h, c, a, harrison, an, influential, pioneer, who, took, up, football, in, 1859, at, the, invitation, of, wills, his, cousin, the, game, around, this, time, was, defensive, and, low, scoring, played, low, to, the, ground, in, congested, rugby, style, scrimmages, the, typical, match, was, a, 20, per, side, affair, played, with, a, ball, that, was, roughly, spherical, and, lasted, until, a, team, scored, two, goals, the, shape, of, the, playing, field, was, not, standardised, matches, often, took, place, in, rough, tree, spotted, public, parks, most, notably, the, richmond, paddock, yarra, park, known, colloquially, as, the, melbourne, football, ground, wills, argued, that, the, turf, of, cricket, fields, would, benefit, from, being, trampled, upon, by, footballers, in, winter, and, as, early, as, 1859, football, was, allowed, on, the, mcg, however, cricket, authorities, frequently, prohibited, football, on, their, grounds, until, the, 1870s, when, they, saw, an, opportunity, to, capitalise, on, the, sport, s, growing, popularity, football, gradually, adapted, to, an, oval, shaped, field, and, most, grounds, in, victoria, expanded, to, accommodate, the, dual, purpose, a, situation, that, continues, to, this, day, football, became, organised, in, south, australia, in, 1860, with, the, formation, of, the, adelaide, football, club, the, oldest, football, club, in, australia, outside, victoria, it, devised, its, own, rules, and, along, with, other, adelaide, based, clubs, played, a, variety, of, codes, until, 1876, when, they, uniformly, adopted, most, of, the, victorian, rules, with, south, australian, football, pioneer, charles, kingston, noting, their, similarity, to, the, old, adelaide, rules, similarly, tasmanian, clubs, quarrelled, over, different, rules, until, they, adopted, a, slightly, modified, version, of, the, victorian, game, in, 1879, the, south, australian, football, association, safa, the, sport, s, first, governing, body, formed, on, 30, april, 1877, firmly, establishing, victorian, rules, as, the, preferred, code, in, that, colony, the, victorian, football, association, vfa, formed, the, following, month, clubs, began, touring, the, colonies, in, the, late, 1870s, and, in, 1879, the, first, intercolonial, match, took, place, in, melbourne, between, victoria, and, south, australia, to, standardise, the, sport, across, australia, delegates, representing, the, football, associations, of, south, australia, tasmania, victoria, and, queensland, met, in, 1883, and, updated, the, code, new, rules, such, as, holding, the, ball, led, to, a, golden, era, of, fast, long, kicking, and, high, marking, football, in, the, 1880s, a, time, which, also, saw, players, such, as, george, coulthard, achieve, superstardom, as, well, as, the, rise, of, professionalism, particularly, in, victoria, and, western, australia, where, the, code, took, hold, during, a, series, of, gold, rushes, likewise, when, new, zealand, experienced, a, gold, rush, the, sport, arrived, with, a, rapid, influx, of, australian, miners, now, known, as, australian, rules, or, australasian, rules, the, sport, became, the, first, football, code, to, develop, mass, spectator, appeal, attracting, world, record, attendances, for, sports, viewing, and, gaining, a, reputation, as, the, people, s, game, australian, rules, football, reached, queensland, and, new, south, wales, as, early, as, 1866, the, sport, experienced, a, period, of, dominance, in, the, former, and, in, the, latter, several, regions, remain, strongholds, of, australian, rules, such, as, the, riverina, however, by, the, late, 1880s, rugby, football, had, become, the, dominant, code, in, both, colonies, as, well, as, in, new, zealand, this, shift, was, largely, due, to, rugby, s, spread, with, british, migration, regional, rivalries, and, the, lack, of, strong, local, governing, bodies, in, the, case, of, sydney, denial, of, access, to, grounds, the, influence, of, university, headmasters, from, britain, who, favoured, rugby, and, the, loss, of, players, to, other, codes, inhibited, the, game, s, growth, in, 1896, delegates, from, six, of, the, wealthiest, vfa, clubs, carlton, essendon, fitzroy, geelong, melbourne, and, south, melbourne, met, to, discuss, the, formation, of, a, breakaway, professional, competition, later, joined, by, collingwood, and, st, kilda, the, clubs, formed, the, victorian, football, league, vfl, which, held, its, inaugural, season, in, 1897, the, vfl, s, popularity, grew, rapidly, as, it, made, several, innovations, such, as, instituting, a, finals, system, reducing, teams, from, 20, to, 18, players, and, introducing, the, behind, as, a, score, richmond, and, university, joined, the, vfl, in, 1908, and, by, 1925, with, the, addition, of, hawthorn, footscray, and, north, melbourne, it, had, become, the, preeminent, league, in, the, country, and, would, take, a, leading, role, in, many, aspects, of, the, sport, the, time, around, the, federation, of, the, australian, colonies, in, 1901, saw, australian, rules, undergo, a, revival, in, new, south, wales, new, zealand, and, queensland, in, 1903, both, the, queensland, australian, football, league, and, the, nsw, australian, football, association, were, established, and, in, new, zealand, as, it, moved, towards, becoming, a, dominion, leagues, were, also, established, in, the, major, cities, this, renewed, popularity, helped, encourage, the, formation, of, the, australasian, football, council, which, in, 1908, in, melbourne, staged, the, first, national, interstate, competition, the, jubilee, australasian, football, carnival, with, teams, representing, each, state, and, new, zealand, the, game, was, also, established, early, on, in, the, new, territories, in, the, new, national, capital, canberra, both, soccer, and, rugby, had, a, head, start, but, following, the, first, matches, in, 1911, australian, rules, football, in, the, australian, capital, territory, became, a, major, participation, sport, by, 1981, it, had, become, much, neglected, and, quickly, lagged, behind, the, other, football, codes, australian, rules, football, in, the, northern, territory, began, shortly, after, the, outbreak, of, the, war, in, 1916, with, the, first, match, in, darwin, the, game, went, on, to, become, the, most, popular, sport, in, the, territory, and, build, the, highest, participation, rate, for, the, sport, nationally, both, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, had, a, devastating, effect, on, australian, football, and, on, australian, sport, in, general, while, scratch, matches, were, played, by, australian, diggers, in, remote, locations, around, the, world, the, game, lost, many, of, its, great, players, to, wartime, service, some, clubs, and, competitions, never, fully, recovered, between, 1914, and, 1915, a, proposed, hybrid, code, of, australian, football, and, rugby, league, the, predominant, code, of, football, in, new, south, wales, and, queensland, was, trialled, without, success, in, queensland, the, state, league, went, into, recess, for, the, duration, of, the, war, vfl, club, university, left, the, league, and, went, into, recess, due, to, severe, casualties, the, wafl, lost, two, clubs, and, the, sanfl, was, suspended, for, one, year, in, 1916, due, to, heavy, club, losses, the, anzac, day, match, the, annual, game, between, essendon, and, collingwood, on, anzac, day, is, one, example, of, how, the, war, continues, to, be, remembered, in, the, football, community, the, role, of, the, australian, national, football, council, anfc, was, primarily, to, govern, the, game, at, a, national, level, and, to, facilitate, interstate, representative, and, club, competition, in, 1968, the, anfc, revived, the, championship, of, australia, a, competition, first, held, in, 1888, between, the, premiers, of, the, vfa, and, safa, although, clubs, from, other, states, were, at, times, invited, the, final, was, almost, always, between, the, premiers, from, the, two, strongest, state, competitions, of, the, time, south, australia, and, victoria, with, adelaide, hosting, most, of, the, matches, at, the, request, of, the, safa, sanfl, the, last, match, took, place, in, 1976, with, north, adelaide, being, the, last, non, victorian, winner, in, 1972, between, 1976, and, 1987, the, anfc, and, later, the, australian, football, championships, afc, ran, a, night, series, which, invited, clubs, and, representative, sides, from, around, the, country, to, participate, in, a, knock, out, tournament, parallel, to, the, premiership, seasons, which, victorian, sides, still, dominated, with, the, lack, of, international, competition, state, representative, matches, were, regarded, with, great, importance, due, in, part, to, the, vfl, poaching, talent, from, other, states, victoria, dominated, interstate, matches, for, three, quarters, of, a, century, state, of, origin, rules, introduced, in, 1977, stipulated, that, rather, than, representing, the, state, of, their, adopted, club, players, would, return, to, play, for, the, state, they, were, first, recruited, in, this, instantly, broke, victoria, s, stranglehold, over, state, titles, and, western, australia, and, south, australia, began, to, win, more, of, their, games, against, victoria, both, new, south, wales, and, tasmania, scored, surprise, victories, at, home, against, victoria, in, 1990, the, term, barassi, line, named, after, vfl, star, ron, barassi, was, coined, by, scholar, ian, turner, in, 1978, to, describe, the, fictitious, geographical, barrier, separating, the, rugby, following, parts, of, new, south, wales, and, queensland, from, the, rest, of, the, country, where, australian, football, reigned, it, became, a, reference, point, for, the, expansion, of, australian, football, and, for, establishing, a, national, league, the, way, the, game, was, played, had, changed, dramatically, due, to, innovative, coaching, tactics, with, the, phasing, out, of, many, of, the, game, s, kicking, styles, and, the, increasing, use, of, handball, while, presentation, was, influenced, by, television, in, 1982, in, a, move, that, heralded, big, changes, within, the, sport, one, of, the, original, vfl, clubs, south, melbourne, relocated, to, sydney, and, became, known, as, the, sydney, swans, in, the, late, 1980s, due, to, the, poor, financial, standing, of, many, of, the, victorian, clubs, and, a, similar, situation, existing, in, western, australia, in, the, sport, the, vfl, pursued, a, more, national, competition, two, more, non, victorian, clubs, west, coast, and, brisbane, joined, the, league, in, 1987, generating, more, than, 8, million, in, license, revenue, for, the, victorian, clubs, and, increasing, broadcast, revenues, which, helped, the, victorian, clubs, survive, in, their, early, years, the, sydney, and, brisbane, clubs, struggled, both, on, and, off, field, because, the, substantial, tv, revenues, they, generated, by, playing, on, a, sunday, went, to, the, vfl, to, protect, these, revenues, the, vfl, granted, significant, draft, concessions, and, financial, aid, to, keep, the, expansion, clubs, competitive, the, vfl, changed, its, name, to, the, australian, football, league, afl, for, the, 1990, season, and, over, the, next, decade, three, non, victorian, clubs, gained, entry, adelaide, 1991, fremantle, 1995, and, the, sanfl, s, port, adelaide, 1997, the, only, pre, existing, club, outside, victoria, to, join, the, league, in, 2011, and, 2012, respectively, two, new, non, victorian, clubs, were, added, to, the, competition, gold, coast, and, greater, western, sydney, the, afl, currently, with, 18, member, clubs, is, the, sport, s, elite, competition, and, most, powerful, body, following, the, emergence, of, the, afl, state, leagues, were, quickly, relegated, to, a, second, tier, status, the, vfa, merged, with, the, former, vfl, reserves, competition, in, 1998, adopting, the, vfl, name, state, of, origin, also, declined, in, importance, especially, after, an, increasing, number, of, player, withdrawals, the, afl, turned, its, focus, to, the, annual, international, rules, series, against, ireland, in, 1998, before, abolishing, state, of, origin, the, following, year, state, and, territorial, leagues, still, contest, interstate, matches, as, do, afl, women, players, in, the, 2010s, the, afl, signalled, further, attempts, at, expanding, into, markets, outside, australian, football, s, traditional, heartlands, by, hosting, home, and, away, matches, in, new, zealand, followed, by, china, after, several, failed, bids, since,

affiliated, with, the, afl, these, state, leagues, hold, annual, semi, professional, club, competitions, with, some, also, overseeing, more, than, one, league, local, semi, professional, or, amateur, organisations, and, competitions, are, often, affiliated, to, their, state, organisations, in, 2002, the, afl, became, the, de, facto, world, governing, body, for, australian, football, when, it,

team, at, the, end, of, each, year, the, high, level, of, interest, shown, by, women, in, australian, football, is, considered, unique, among, the, world, s, football, codes, it, was, the, case, in, the, 19th, century, as, it, is, in, modern, times, that, women, made, up, approximately, half, of, total, attendances, at, australian, football, matches, a, far, greater, proportion, than, for, example, the, estimated, 10, per, cent, of, women, that, comprise, british, soccer, crowds, this, has, been, attributed, in, part, to, the, egalitarian, character, of, australian, football, s, early, years, in, public, parks, where, women, could, mingle, freely, and, support, the, game, in, various, ways, in, terms, of, participation, there, are, occasional, 19th, century, references, to, women, playing, the, sport, but, it, was, not, until, the, 1910s, that, the, first, organised, women, s, teams, and, competitions, appeared, women, s, state, leagues, emerged, in, the, 1980s, and, in, 2013, the, afl, announced, plans, to, establish, a, nationally, televised, women, s, competition, amidst, a, surge, in, viewing, interest, and, participation, in, women, s, football, the, afl, pushed, the,
