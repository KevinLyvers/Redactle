go, is, an, abstract, strategy, board, game, for, two, players, in, which, the, aim, is, to, fence, off, more, territory, than, the, opponent, the, game, was, invented, in, china, more, than, 2, 500, years, ago, and, is, believed, to, be, the, oldest, board, game, continuously, played, to, the, present, day, a, 2016, survey, by, the, international, go, federation, s, 75, member, nations, found, that, there, are, over, 46, million, people, worldwide, who, know, how, to, play, go, and, over, 20, million, current, players, the, majority, of, whom, live, in, east, asia, the, playing, pieces, are, called, stones, one, player, uses, the, white, stones, and, the, other, black, the, players, take, turns, placing, their, stones, on, the, vacant, intersections, points, on, the, board, once, placed, stones, may, not, be, moved, but, captured, stones, are, immediately, removed, from, the, board, a, single, stone, or, connected, group, of, stones, is, captured, when, surrounded, by, the, opponent, s, stones, on, all, orthogonally, adjacent, points, the, game, proceeds, until, neither, player, wishes, to, make, another, move, when, a, game, concludes, the, winner, is, determined, by, counting, each, player, s, surrounded, territory, along, with, captured, stones, and, komi, points, added, to, the, score, of, the, player, with, the, white, stones, as, compensation, for, playing, second, games, may, also, end, by, resignation, the, standard, go, board, has, a, 19, 19, grid, of, lines, containing, 361, points, beginners, often, play, on, smaller, 9, 9, and, 13, 13, boards, and, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, the, game, was, played, in, earlier, centuries, on, a, board, with, a, 17, 17, grid, boards, with, a, 19, 19, grid, had, become, standard, however, by, the, time, the, game, reached, korea, in, the, 5th, century, ce, and, japan, in, the, 7th, century, ce, go, was, considered, one, of, the, four, essential, arts, of, the, cultured, aristocratic, chinese, scholars, in, antiquity, the, earliest, written, reference, to, the, game, is, generally, recognized, as, the, historical, annal, zuo, zhuan, c, 4th, century, bce, despite, its, relatively, simple, rules, go, is, extremely, complex, compared, to, chess, go, has, both, a, larger, board, with, more, scope, for, play, and, longer, games, and, on, average, many, more, alternatives, to, consider, per, move, the, number, of, legal, board, positions, in, go, has, been, calculated, to, be, approximately, 2, 1, 10, 170, which, is, far, greater, than, the, number, of, atoms, in, the, observable, universe, which, is, estimated, to, be, on, the, order, of, 10, 80, the, name, go, is, a, short, form, of, the, japanese, word, igo, which, derives, from, earlier, wigo, in, turn, from, middle, chinese, i, gi, mandarin, w, iq, lit, encirclement, board, game, or, board, game, of, surrounding, in, english, the, name, go, when, used, for, the, game, is, often, capitalized, to, differentiate, it, from, the, common, word, go, in, events, sponsored, by, the, ing, chang, ki, foundation, it, is, spelled, goe, the, korean, name, baduk, derives, from, the, middle, korean, word, badok, the, origin, of, which, is, controversial, the, more, plausible, etymologies, include, the, suffix, dok, added, to, ba, to, mean, flat, and, wide, board, or, the, joining, of, bat, meaning, field, and, dok, meaning, stone, less, plausible, etymologies, include, a, derivation, of, badukdok, referring, to, the, playing, pieces, of, the, game, or, a, derivation, from, chinese, p, izi, meaning, to, arrange, pieces, go, is, an, adversarial, game, between, two, players, with, the, objective, of, capturing, territory, that, is, occupying, and, surrounding, a, larger, total, empty, area, of, the, board, with, one, s, stones, than, the, opponent, as, the, game, progresses, the, players, place, stones, on, the, board, creating, stone, formations, and, enclosing, spaces, stones, are, never, moved, on, the, board, but, when, captured, are, removed, from, the, board, stones, are, linked, together, into, a, formation, by, being, adjacent, along, the, black, lines, not, on, diagonals, of, which, there, are, none, contests, between, opposing, formations, are, often, extremely, complex, and, may, result, in, the, expansion, reduction, or, wholesale, capture, and, loss, of, formations, and, their, enclosed, empty, spaces, called, eyes, another, essential, component, of, the, game, is, control, of, the, sente, that, is, controlling, the, offense, so, that, one, s, opponent, is, forced, into, defensive, moves, this, usually, changes, several, times, during, play, initially, the, board, is, bare, and, players, alternate, turns, to, place, one, stone, per, turn, as, the, game, proceeds, players, try, to, link, their, stones, together, into, living, formations, meaning, that, they, are, permanently, safe, from, capture, as, well, as, threaten, to, capture, their, opponent, s, stones, and, formations, stones, have, both, offensive, and, defensive, characteristics, depending, on, the, situation, an, essential, concept, is, that, a, formation, of, stones, must, be, have, or, be, capable, of, making, at, least, two, enclosed, open, points, known, as, eyes, to, preserve, itself, from, being, captured, a, formation, having, at, least, two, eyes, cannot, be, captured, even, after, it, is, surrounded, by, the, opponent, on, the, outside, because, each, eye, constitutes, a, liberty, that, must, be, filled, by, the, opponent, as, the, final, step, in, capture, a, formation, having, two, or, more, eyes, is, said, to, be, unconditionally, alive, so, it, can, evade, capture, indefinitely, and, a, group, that, cannot, form, two, eyes, is, said, to, be, dead, and, can, be, captured, the, general, strategy, is, to, place, stones, to, fence, off, territory, attack, the, opponent, s, weak, groups, trying, to, kill, them, so, they, will, be, removed, and, always, stay, mindful, of, the, life, status, of, one, s, own, groups, the, liberties, of, groups, are, countable, situations, where, mutually, opposing, groups, must, capture, each, other, or, die, are, called, capturing, races, or, semeai, in, a, capturing, race, the, group, with, more, liberties, will, ultimately, be, able, to, capture, the, opponent, s, stones, capturing, races, and, the, elements, of, life, or, death, are, the, primary, challenges, of, go, in, the, end, game, players, may, pass, rather, than, place, a, stone, if, they, think, there, are, no, further, opportunities, for, profitable, play, the, game, ends, when, both, players, pass, or, when, one, player, resigns, in, general, to, score, the, game, each, player, counts, the, number, of, unoccupied, points, surrounded, by, their, stones, and, then, subtracts, the, number, of, stones, that, were, captured, by, the, opponent, the, player, with, the, greater, score, after, adjusting, for, handicapping, called, komi, wins, the, game, in, the, opening, stages, of, the, game, players, typically, establish, groups, of, stones, or, bases, near, the, corners, and, around, the, sides, of, the, board, usually, starting, on, the, third, or, fourth, line, in, from, the, board, edge, rather, than, at, the, very, edge, of, the, board, the, edges, and, corners, make, it, easier, to, develop, groups, which, have, better, options, for, life, self, viability, for, a, group, of, stones, that, prevents, capture, and, establish, formations, for, potential, territory, players, usually, start, near, the, corners, because, establishing, territory, is, easier, with, the, aid, of, two, edges, of, the, board, established, corner, opening, sequences, are, called, joseki, and, are, often, studied, independently, however, in, the, mid, game, stone, groups, must, also, reach, in, towards, the, large, central, area, of, the, board, to, capture, more, territory, dame, are, points, that, lie, in, between, the, boundary, walls, of, black, and, white, and, as, such, are, considered, to, be, of, no, value, to, either, side, seki, are, mutually, alive, pairs, of, white, and, black, groups, where, neither, has, two, eyes, ko, chinese, and, japanese, is, a, potentially, indefinitely, repeated, stone, capture, position, the, rules, do, not, allow, a, board, position, to, be, repeated, therefore, any, move, which, would, restore, the, previous, board, position, would, not, be, allowed, and, the, next, player, would, be, forced, to, play, somewhere, else, if, the, play, requires, a, strategic, response, by, the, first, player, further, changing, the, board, then, the, second, player, could, retake, the, ko, and, the, first, player, would, be, in, the, same, situation, of, needing, to, change, the, board, before, trying, to, take, the, ko, back, and, so, on, some, of, these, ko, fights, may, be, important, and, decide, the, life, of, a, large, group, while, others, may, be, worth, just, one, or, two, points, some, ko, fights, are, referred, to, as, picnic, kos, when, only, one, side, has, a, lot, to, lose, in, japanese, it, is, called, a, hanami, ko, playing, with, others, usually, requires, a, knowledge, of, each, player, s, strength, indicated, by, the, player, s, rank, increasing, from, 30, kyu, to, 1, kyu, then, 1, dan, to, 7, dan, then, 1, dan, pro, to, 9, dan, pro, a, difference, in, rank, may, be, compensated, by, a, handicap, black, is, allowed, to, place, two, or, more, stones, on, the, board, to, compensate, for, white, s, greater, strength, there, are, different, rulesets, korean, japanese, chinese, aga, etc, which, are, almost, entirely, equivalent, except, for, certain, special, case, positions, and, the, method, of, scoring, at, the, end, basic, strategic, aspects, include, the, following, the, strategy, involved, can, become, very, abstract, and, complex, high, level, players, spend, years, improving, their, understanding, of, strategy, and, a, novice, may, play, many, hundreds, of, games, against, opponents, before, being, able, to, win, regularly, strategy, deals, with, global, influence, the, interaction, between, distant, stones, keeping, the, whole, board, in, mind, during, local, fights, and, other, issues, that, involve, the, overall, game, it, is, therefore, possible, to, allow, a, tactical, loss, when, it, confers, a, strategic, advantage, novices, often, start, by, randomly, placing, stones, on, the, board, as, if, it, were, a, game, of, chance, an, understanding, of, how, stones, connect, for, greater, power, develops, and, then, a, few, basic, common, opening, sequences, may, be, understood, learning, the, ways, of, life, and, death, helps, in, a, fundamental, way, to, develop, one, s, strategic, understanding, of, weak, groups, a, player, who, both, plays, aggressively, and, can, handle, adversity, is, said, to, display, kiai, or, fighting, spirit, in, the, game, in, the, opening, of, the, game, players, usually, play, and, gain, territory, in, the, corners, of, the, board, first, as, the, presence, of, two, edges, makes, it, easier, for, them, to, surround, territory, and, establish, the, eyes, they, need, from, a, secure, position, in, a, corner, it, is, possible, to, lay, claim, to, more, territory, by, extending, along, the, side, of, the, board, the, opening, is, the, most, theoretically, difficult, part, of, the, game, and, takes, a, large, proportion, of, professional, players, thinking, time, the, first, stone, played, at, a, corner, of, the, board, is, generally, placed, on, the, third, or, fourth, line, from, the, edge, players, tend, to, play, on, or, near, the, 4, 4, star, point, during, the, opening, playing, nearer, to, the, edge, does, not, produce, enough, territory, to, be, efficient, and, playing, further, from, the, edge, does, not, safely, secure, the, territory, in, the, opening, players, often, play, established, sequences, called, joseki, which, are, locally, balanced, exchanges, however, the, joseki, chosen, should, also, produce, a, satisfactory, result, on, a, global, scale, it, is, generally, advisable, to, keep, a, balance, between, territory, and, influence, which, of, these, gets, precedence, is, often, a, matter, of, individual, taste, the, middle, phase, of, the, game, is, the, most, combative, and, usually, lasts, for, more, than, 100, moves, during, the, middlegame, the, players, invade, each, other, s, territories, and, attack, formations, that, lack, the, necessary, two, eyes, for, viability, such, groups, may, be, saved, or, sacrificed, for, something, more, significant, on, the, board, it, is, possible, that, one, player, may, succeed, in, capturing, a, large, weak, group, of, the, opponent, s, which, often, proves, decisive, and, ends, the, game, by, a, resignation, however, matters, may, be, more, complex, yet, with, major, trade, offs, apparently, dead, groups, reviving, and, skillful, play, to, attack, in, such, a, way, as, to, construct, territories, rather, than, kill, the, end, of, the, middlegame, and, transition, to, the, endgame, is, marked, by, a, few, features, near, the, end, of, a, game, play, becomes, divided, into, localized, fights, that, do, not, affect, each, other, with, the, exception, of, ko, fights, where, before, the, central, area, of, the, board, related, to, all, parts, of, it, no, large, weak, groups, are, still, in, serious, danger, moves, can, reasonably, be, attributed, some, definite, value, such, as, 20, points, or, fewer, rather, than, simply, being, necessary, to, compete, both, players, set, limited, objectives, in, their, plans, in, making, or, destroying, territory, capturing, or, saving, stones, these, changing, aspects, of, the, game, usually, occur, at, much, the, same, time, for, strong, players, in, brief, the, middlegame, switches, into, the, endgame, when, the, concepts, of, strategy, and, influence, need, reassessment, in, terms, of, concrete, final, results, on, the, board, aside, from, the, order, of, play, alternating, moves, black, moves, first, or, takes, a, handicap, and, scoring, rules, there, are, essentially, only, two, rules, in, go, almost, all, other, information, about, how, the, game, is, played, is, heuristic, meaning, it, is, learned, information, about, how, the, patterns, of, the, stones, on, the, board, function, rather, than, a, rule, other, rules, are, specialized, as, they, come, about, through, different, rulesets, but, the, above, two, rules, cover, almost, all, of, any, played, game, although, there, are, some, minor, differences, between, rulesets, used, in, different, countries, most, notably, in, chinese, and, japanese, scoring, rules, these, differences, do, not, greatly, affect, the, tactics, and, strategy, of, the, game, except, where, noted, the, basic, rules, presented, here, are, valid, independent, of, the, scoring, rules, used, the, scoring, rules, are, explained, separately, go, terms, for, which, there, is, no, ready, english, equivalent, are, commonly, called, by, their, japanese, names, the, two, players, black, and, white, take, turns, placing, stones, of, their, color, on, the, intersections, of, the, board, one, stone, at, a, time, the, usual, board, size, is, a, 19, 19, grid, but, for, beginners, or, for, playing, quick, games, the, smaller, board, sizes, of, 13, 13, and, 9, 9, are, also, popular, the, board, is, empty, to, begin, with, black, plays, first, unless, given, a, handicap, of, two, or, more, stones, in, which, case, white, plays, first, the, players, may, choose, any, unoccupied, intersection, to, play, on, except, for, those, forbidden, by, the, ko, and, suicide, rules, see, below, once, played, a, stone, can, never, be, moved, and, can, be, taken, off, the, board, only, if, it, is, captured, a, player, may, pass, their, turn, declining, to, place, a, stone, though, this, is, usually, only, done, at, the, end, of, the, game, when, both, players, believe, nothing, more, can, be, accomplished, with, further, play, when, both, players, pass, consecutively, the, game, ends, and, is, then, scored, vertically, and, horizontally, adjacent, stones, of, the, same, color, form, a, chain, also, called, a, string, or, group, forming, a, discrete, unit, that, cannot, then, be, divided, only, stones, connected, to, one, another, by, the, lines, on, the, board, create, a, chain, stones, that, are, diagonally, adjacent, are, not, connected, chains, may, be, expanded, by, placing, additional, stones, on, adjacent, intersections, and, they, can, be, connected, together, by, placing, a, stone, on, an, intersection, that, is, adjacent, to, two, or, more, chains, of, the, same, color, a, vacant, point, adjacent, to, a, stone, along, one, of, the, grid, lines, of, the, board, is, called, a, liberty, for, that, stone, stones, in, a, chain, share, their, liberties, a, chain, of, stones, must, have, at, least, one, liberty, to, remain, on, the, board, when, a, chain, is, surrounded, by, opposing, stones, so, that, it, has, no, liberties, it, is, captured, and, removed, from, the, board, an, example, of, a, situation, in, which, the, ko, rule, applies, players, are, not, allowed, to, make, a, move, that, returns, the, game, to, the, immediately, prior, position, this, rule, called, the, ko, rule, prevents, unending, repetition, a, stalemate, as, shown, in, the, example, pictured, white, had, a, stone, where, the, red, circle, was, and, black, has, just, captured, it, by, playing, a, stone, at, 1, so, the, white, stone, has, been, removed, however, it, is, readily, apparent, that, now, black, s, stone, at, 1, is, immediately, threatened, by, the, three, surrounding, white, stones, if, white, were, allowed, to, play, again, on, the, red, circle, it, would, return, the, situation, to, the, original, one, but, the, ko, rule, forbids, that, kind, of, endless, repetition, thus, white, is, forced, to, move, elsewhere, or, pass, if, white, wants, to, recapture, black, s, stone, at, 1, white, must, attack, black, somewhere, else, on, the, board, so, forcefully, that, black, moves, elsewhere, to, counter, that, giving, white, that, chance, if, white, s, forcing, move, is, successful, it, is, termed, gaining, the, sente, if, black, responds, elsewhere, on, the, board, then, white, can, retake, black, s, stone, at, 1, and, the, ko, continues, but, this, time, black, must, move, elsewhere, a, repetition, of, such, exchanges, is, called, a, ko, fight, to, stop, the, potential, for, ko, fights, two, stones, of, the, same, color, would, need, to, be, added, to, the, group, making, either, a, group, of, 5, black, or, 5, white, stones, while, the, various, rulesets, agree, on, the, ko, rule, prohibiting, returning, the, board, to, an, immediately, previous, position, they, deal, in, different, ways, with, the, relatively, uncommon, situation, in, which, a, player, might, recreate, a, past, position, that, is, further, removed, see, rules, of, go, repetition, for, further, information, a, player, may, not, place, a, stone, such, that, it, or, its, group, immediately, has, no, liberties, unless, doing, so, immediately, deprives, an, enemy, group, of, its, final, liberty, in, the, second, case, the, enemy, group, is, captured, leaving, the, new, stone, with, at, least, one, liberty, so, the, new, stone, can, be, placed, this, rule, is, responsible, for, the, all, important, difference, between, one, and, two, eyes, if, a, group, with, only, one, eye, is, fully, surrounded, on, the, outside, it, can, be, killed, with, a, stone, placed, in, its, single, eye, an, eye, is, an, empty, point, or, group, of, points, surrounded, by, a, group, of, stones, the, ing, and, new, zealand, rules, do, not, have, this, rule, and, there, a, player, might, destroy, one, of, its, own, groups, commit, suicide, this, play, would, only, be, useful, in, limited, sets, of, situations, involving, a, small, interior, space, or, planning, in, the, example, at, right, it, may, be, useful, as, a, ko, threat, because, black, has, the, advantage, of, playing, the, first, move, the, idea, of, awarding, white, some, compensation, came, into, being, during, the, 20th, century, this, is, called, komi, which, gives, white, a, 5, 5, point, compensation, under, japanese, rules, 6, 5, point, under, korean, rules, and, 15, 4, stones, or, 7, 5, point, under, chinese, rules, number, of, points, varies, by, rule, set, under, handicap, play, white, receives, only, a, 0, 5, point, komi, to, break, a, possible, tie, jigo, two, general, types, of, scoring, procedures, are, used, and, players, determine, which, to, use, before, play, both, procedures, almost, always, give, the, same, winner, both, procedures, are, counted, after, both, players, have, passed, consecutively, the, stones, that, are, still, on, the, board, but, unable, to, avoid, capture, called, dead, stones, are, removed, given, that, the, number, of, stones, a, player, has, on, the, board, is, directly, related, to, the, number, of, prisoners, their, opponent, has, taken, the, resulting, net, score, that, is, the, difference, between, black, s, and, white, s, scores, is, identical, under, both, rulesets, unless, the, players, have, passed, different, numbers, of, times, during, the, course, of, the, game, thus, the, net, result, given, by, the, two, scoring, systems, rarely, differs, by, more, than, a, point, while, not, actually, mentioned, in, the, rules, of, go, at, least, in, simpler, rule, sets, such, as, those, of, new, zealand, and, the, u, s, the, concept, of, a, living, group, of, stones, is, necessary, for, a, practical, understanding, of, the, game, examples, of, eyes, marked, the, black, groups, at, the, top, of, the, board, are, alive, as, they, have, at, least, two, eyes, the, black, groups, at, the, bottom, are, dead, as, they, only, have, one, eye, the, point, marked, a, is, a, false, eye, thus, the, black, group, with, false, eye, a, can, be, killed, by, white, in, two, turns, when, a, group, of, stones, is, mostly, surrounded, and, has, no, options, to, connect, with, friendly, stones, elsewhere, the, status, of, the, group, is, either, alive, dead, or, unsettled, a, group, of, stones, is, said, to, be, alive, if, it, cannot, be, captured, even, if, the, opponent, is, allowed, to, move, first, conversely, a, group, of, stones, is, said, to, be, dead, if, it, cannot, avoid, capture, even, if, the, owner, of, the, group, is, allowed, the, first, move, otherwise, the, group, is, said, to, be, unsettled, the, defending, player, can, make, it, alive, or, the, opponent, can, kill, it, depending, on, who, gets, to, play, first, an, eye, is, an, empty, point, or, group, of, points, surrounded, by, a, group, of, stones, if, the, eye, is, surrounded, by, black, stones, white, cannot, play, there, unless, such, a, play, would, take, black, s, last, liberty, and, capture, the, black, stones, such, a, move, is, forbidden, according, to, the, suicide, rule, in, most, rule, sets, but, even, if, not, forbidden, such, a, move, would, be, a, useless, suicide, of, a, white, stone, if, a, black, group, has, two, eyes, white, can, never, capture, it, because, white, cannot, remove, both, liberties, simultaneously, if, black, has, only, one, eye, white, can, capture, the, black, group, by, playing, in, the, single, eye, removing, black, s, last, liberty, such, a, move, is, not, suicide, because, the, black, stones, are, removed, first, in, the, examples, of, eyes, diagram, all, the, circled, points, are, eyes, the, two, black, groups, in, the, upper, corners, are, alive, as, both, have, at, least, two, eyes, the, groups, in, the, lower, corners, are, dead, as, both, have, only, one, eye, the, group, in, the, lower, left, may, seem, to, have, two, eyes, but, the, surrounded, empty, point, marked, a, is, not, actually, an, eye, white, can, play, there, and, take, a, black, stone, such, a, point, is, often, called, a, false, eye, there, is, an, exception, to, the, requirement, that, a, group, must, have, two, eyes, to, be, alive, a, situation, called, seki, or, mutual, life, where, different, colored, groups, are, adjacent, and, share, liberties, the, situation, may, reach, a, position, when, neither, player, wants, to, move, first, because, doing, so, would, allow, the, opponent, to, capture, in, such, situations, therefore, both, players, stones, remain, on, the, board, in, seki, neither, player, receives, any, points, for, those, groups, but, at, least, those, groups, themselves, remain, living, as, opposed, to, being, captured, seki, can, occur, in, many, ways, the, simplest, are, in, the, example, of, seki, mutual, life, diagram, the, two, circled, points, are, liberties, shared, by, both, a, black, and, a, white, group, both, of, these, interior, groups, are, at, risk, and, neither, player, wants, to, play, on, a, circled, point, because, doing, so, would, allow, the, opponent, to, capture, their, group, on, the, next, move, the, outer, groups, in, this, example, both, black, and, white, are, alive, seki, can, result, from, an, attempt, by, one, player, to, invade, and, kill, a, nearly, settled, group, of, the, other, player, tactics, deal, with, immediate, fighting, between, stones, capturing, and, saving, stones, life, death, and, other, issues, localized, to, a, specific, part, of, the, board, larger, issues, which, encompass, the, territory, of, the, entire, board, and, planning, stone, group, connections, are, referred, to, as, strategy, and, are, covered, in, the, strategy, section, above, there, are, several, tactical, constructs, aimed, at, capturing, stones, these, are, among, the, first, things, a, player, learns, after, understanding, the, rules, recognizing, the, possibility, that, stones, can, be, captured, using, these, techniques, is, an, important, step, forward, a, ladder, black, cannot, escape, unless, the, ladder, connects, to, black, stones, further, down, the, board, that, will, intercept, with, the, ladder, or, if, one, of, white, s, pieces, has, only, one, liberty, the, most, basic, technique, is, the, ladder, this, is, also, sometimes, called, a, running, attack, since, it, unfolds, as, one, player, trying, to, outrun, the, other, s, attack, to, capture, stones, in, a, ladder, a, player, uses, a, constant, series, of, capture, threats, atari, giving, the, opponent, only, one, place, to, place, his, stone, to, keep, his, group, alive, this, forces, the, opponent, to, move, into, a, zigzag, pattern, surrounding, the, ladder, on, the, outside, as, shown, in, the, adjacent, diagram, to, keep, the, attack, coming, unless, the, pattern, runs, into, friendly, stones, along, the, way, the, stones, in, the, ladder, cannot, avoid, capture, however, if, the, ladder, can, run, into, other, black, stones, thus, saving, them, then, experienced, players, recognize, the, futility, of, continuing, the, attack, these, stones, can, also, be, saved, if, a, suitably, strong, threat, can, be, forced, elsewhere, on, the, board, so, that, two, black, stones, can, be, placed, here, to, save, the, group, a, net, the, chain, of, three, marked, black, stones, cannot, escape, in, any, direction, since, each, black, stone, attempting, to, extend, the, chain, outward, on, the, red, circles, can, be, easily, blocked, by, one, white, stone, another, technique, to, capture, stones, is, the, so, called, net, also, known, by, its, japanese, name, geta, this, refers, to, a, move, that, loosely, surrounds, some, stones, preventing, their, escape, in, all, directions, an, example, is, given, in, the, adjacent, diagram, it, is, often, better, to, capture, stones, in, a, net, than, in, a, ladder, because, a, net, does, not, depend, on, the, condition, that, there, are, no, opposing, stones, in, the, way, nor, does, it, allow, the, opponent, to, play, a, strategic, ladder, breaker, however, the, ladder, only, requires, one, turn, to, kill, all, the, opponent, s, stones, whereas, a, net, requires, more, turns, to, do, the, same, a, snapback, although, black, can, capture, the, white, stone, by, playing, at, the, circled, point, the, resulting, shape, for, black, has, only, one, liberty, at, 1, thus, white, can, then, capture, the, three, black, stones, by, playing, at, 1, again, snapback, a, third, technique, to, capture, stones, is, the, snapback, in, a, snapback, one, player, allows, a, single, stone, to, be, captured, then, immediately, plays, on, the, point, formerly, occupied, by, that, stone, by, so, doing, the, player, captures, a, larger, group, of, their, opponent, s, stones, in, effect, snapping, back, at, those, stones, an, example, can, be, seen, on, the, right, as, with, the, ladder, an, experienced, player, does, not, play, out, such, a, sequence, recognizing, the, futility, of, capturing, only, to, be, captured, back, immediately, one, of, the, most, important, skills, required, for, strong, tactical, play, is, the, ability, to, read, ahead, reading, ahead, includes, considering, available, moves, to, play, the, possible, responses, to, each, move, and, the, subsequent, possibilities, after, each, of, those, responses, some, of, the, strongest, players, of, the, game, can, read, up, to, 40, moves, ahead, even, in, complicated, positions, as, explained, in, the, scoring, rules, some, stone, formations, can, never, be, captured, and, are, said, to, be, alive, while, other, stones, may, be, in, a, position, where, they, cannot, avoid, being, captured, and, are, said, to, be, dead, much, of, the, practice, material, available, to, players, of, the, game, comes, in, the, form, of, life, and, death, problems, also, known, as, tsumego, in, such, problems, players, are, challenged, to, find, the, vital, move, sequence, that, kills, a, group, of, the, opponent, or, saves, a, group, of, their, own, tsumego, are, considered, an, excellent, way, to, train, a, player, s, ability, at, reading, ahead, and, are, available, for, all, skill, levels, some, posing, a, challenge, even, to, top, players, in, situations, when, the, ko, rule, applies, a, ko, fight, may, occur, if, the, player, who, is, prohibited, from, capture, is, of, the, opinion, that, the, capture, is, important, because, it, prevents, a, large, group, of, stones, from, being, captured, for, instance, the, player, may, play, a, ko, threat, this, is, a, move, elsewhere, on, the, board, that, threatens, to, make, a, large, profit, if, the, opponent, does, not, respond, if, the, opponent, does, respond, to, the, ko, threat, the, situation, on, the, board, has, changed, and, the, prohibition, on, capturing, the, ko, no, longer, applies, thus, the, player, who, made, the, ko, threat, may, now, recapture, the, ko, their, opponent, is, then, in, the, same, situation, and, can, either, play, a, ko, threat, as, well, or, concede, the, ko, by, simply, playing, elsewhere, if, a, player, concedes, the, ko, either, because, they, do, not, think, it, important, or, because, there, are, no, moves, left, that, could, function, as, a, ko, threat, they, have, lost, the, ko, and, their, opponent, may, connect, the, ko, instead, of, responding, to, a, ko, threat, a, player, may, also, choose, to, ignore, the, threat, and, connect, the, ko, they, thereby, win, the, ko, but, at, a, cost, the, choice, of, when, to, respond, to, a, threat, and, when, to, ignore, it, is, a, subtle, one, which, requires, a, player, to, consider, many, factors, including, how, much, is, gained, by, connecting, how, much, is, lost, by, not, responding, how, many, possible, ko, threats, both, players, have, remaining, what, the, optimal, order, of, playing, them, is, and, what, the, size, points, lost, or, gained, of, each, of, the, remaining, threats, is, frequently, the, winner, of, the, ko, fight, does, not, connect, the, ko, but, instead, captures, one, of, the, chains, that, constituted, their, opponent, s, side, of, the, ko, in, some, cases, this, leads, to, another, ko, fight, at, a, neighboring, location, the, earliest, written, reference, to, the, game, is, generally, recognized, as, the, historical, annal, zuo, zhuan, c, 4th, century, bce, referring, to, a, historical, event, of, 548, bce, it, is, also, mentioned, in, book, xvii, of, the, analects, of, confucius, and, in, two, books, written, by, mencius, c, 3rd, century, bce, in, all, of, these, works, the, game, is, referred, to, as, y, today, in, china, it, is, known, as, weiqi, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, w, iq, wade, giles, wei, ch, i, lit, encirclement, board, game, go, was, originally, played, on, a, 17, 17, line, grid, but, a, 19, 19, grid, became, standard, by, the, time, of, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ce, legends, trace, the, origin, of, the, game, to, the, mythical, chinese, emperor, yao, 2337, 2258, bce, who, was, said, to, have, had, his, counselor, shun, design, it, for, his, unruly, son, danzhu, to, favorably, influence, him, other, theories, suggest, that, the, game, was, derived, from, chinese, tribal, warlords, and, generals, who, used, pieces, of, stone, to, map, out, attacking, positions, in, china, go, had, an, important, status, among, elites, and, was, associated, with, ideas, of, self, cultivation, wisdom, and, gentlemanly, ideals, 23, it, was, considered, one, of, the, four, cultivated, arts, of, the, chinese, scholar, gentleman, along, with, calligraphy, painting, and, playing, the, musical, instrument, guqin, in, ancient, times, the, rules, of, go, were, passed, on, verbally, rather, than, being, written, down, go, was, introduced, to, korea, sometime, between, the, 5th, and, 7th, centuries, ce, and, was, popular, among, the, higher, classes, in, korea, the, game, is, called, baduk, korean, and, a, variant, of, the, game, called, sunjang, baduk, was, developed, by, the, 16th, century, sunjang, baduk, became, the, main, variant, played, in, korea, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, current, version, was, reintroduced, from, japan, the, game, reached, japan, in, the, 7th, century, ce, where, it, is, called, go, or, igo, it, became, popular, at, the, japanese, imperial, court, in, the, 8th, century, and, among, the, general, public, by, the, 13th, century, the, game, was, further, formalized, in, the, 15th, century, in, 1603, tokugawa, ieyasu, re, established, japan, s, unified, national, government, in, the, same, year, he, assigned, the, then, best, player, in, japan, a, buddhist, monk, named, nikkai, n, kan, yosaburo, 1559, to, the, post, of, godokoro, minister, of, go, nikkai, took, the, name, hon, inb, sansa, and, founded, the, hon, inb, go, school, several, competing, schools, were, founded, soon, after, these, officially, recognized, and, subsidized, go, schools, greatly, developed, the, level, of, play, and, introduced, the, dan, kyu, style, system, of, ranking, players, players, from, the, four, schools, hon, inb, yasui, inoue, and, hayashi, competed, in, the, annual, castle, games, played, in, the, presence, of, the, sh, gun, despite, its, widespread, popularity, in, east, asia, go, has, been, slow, to, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, world, although, there, are, some, mentions, of, the, game, in, western, literature, from, the, 16th, century, forward, go, did, not, start, to, become, popular, in, the, west, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, german, scientist, oskar, korschelt, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, game, by, the, early, 20th, century, go, had, spread, throughout, the, german, and, austro, hungarian, empires, in, 1905, edward, lasker, learned, the, game, while, in, berlin, when, he, moved, to, new, york, lasker, founded, the, new, york, go, club, together, with, amongst, others, arthur, smith, who, had, learned, of, the, game, in, japan, while, touring, the, east, and, had, published, the, book, the, game, of, go, in, 1908, lasker, s, book, go, and, go, moku, 1934, helped, spread, the, game, throughout, the, u, s, and, in, 1935, the, american, go, association, was, formed, two, years, later, in, 1937, the, german, go, association, was, founded, world, war, ii, put, a, stop, to, most, go, activity, since, it, was, a, popular, game, in, japan, but, after, the, war, go, continued, to, spread, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, the, japan, go, association, nihon, ki, in, played, a, leading, role, in, spreading, go, outside, east, asia, by, publishing, the, english, language, magazine, go, review, in, the, 1960s, establishing, go, centers, in, the, u, s, europe, and, south, america, and, often, sending, professional, teachers, on, tour, to, western, nations, internationally, the, game, had, been, commonly, known, since, the, start, of, the, twentieth, century, by, its, shortened, japanese, name, and, terms, for, common, go, concepts, are, derived, from, their, japanese, pronunciation, in, 1996, nasa, astronaut, daniel, barry, and, japanese, astronaut, koichi, wakata, became, the, first, people, to, play, go, in, space, they, used, a, special, go, set, which, was, named, go, space, designed, by, wai, cheung, willson, chow, both, astronauts, were, awarded, honorary, dan, ranks, by, the, nihon, ki, in, as, of, december, 2015, the, international, go, federation, has, 75, member, countries, with, 67, member, countries, outside, east, asia, chinese, cultural, centres, across, the, world, are, promoting, go, and, cooperating, with, local, go, associations, for, example, the, seminars, held, by, the, chinese, cultural, centre, in, tel, aviv, israel, together, with, the, israeli, go, association, in, go, rank, indicates, a, player, s, skill, in, the, game, traditionally, ranks, are, measured, using, kyu, and, dan, grades, a, system, also, adopted, by, many, martial, arts, more, recently, mathematical, rating, systems, similar, to, the, elo, rating, system, have, been, introduced, such, rating, systems, often, provide, a, mechanism, for, converting, a, rating, to, a, kyu, or, dan, grade, kyu, grades, abbreviated, k, are, considered, student, grades, and, decrease, as, playing, level, increases, meaning, 1st, kyu, is, the, strongest, available, kyu, grade, dan, grades, abbreviated, d, are, considered, master, grades, and, increase, from, 1st, dan, to, 7th, dan, first, dan, equals, a, black, belt, in, eastern, martial, arts, using, this, system, the, difference, among, each, amateur, rank, is, one, handicap, stone, for, example, if, a, 5k, plays, a, game, with, a, 1k, the, 5k, would, need, a, handicap, of, four, stones, to, even, the, odds, top, level, amateur, players, sometimes, defeat, professionals, in, tournament, play, professional, players, have, professional, dan, ranks, abbreviated, p, these, ranks, are, separate, from, amateur, ranks, the, rank, system, comprises, from, the, lowest, to, highest, ranks, tournament, and, match, rules, deal, with, factors, that, may, influence, the, game, but, are, not, part, of, the, actual, rules, of, play, such, rules, may, differ, between, events, rules, that, influence, the, game, include, the, setting, of, compensation, points, komi, handicap, and, time, control, parameters, rules, that, do, not, generally, influence, the, game, are, the, tournament, system, pairing, strategies, and, placement, criteria, common, tournament, systems, used, in, go, include, the, mcmahon, system, swiss, system, league, systems, and, the, knockout, system, tournaments, may, combine, multiple, systems, many, professional, go, tournaments, use, a, combination, of, the, league, and, knockout, systems, tournament, rules, may, also, set, the, following, a, game, of, go, may, be, timed, using, a, game, clock, formal, time, controls, were, introduced, into, the, professional, game, during, the, 1920s, and, were, controversial, adjournments, and, sealed, moves, began, to, be, regulated, in, the, 1930s, go, tournaments, use, a, number, of, different, time, control, systems, all, common, systems, envisage, a, single, main, period, of, time, for, each, player, for, the, game, but, they, vary, on, the, protocols, for, continuation, in, overtime, after, a, player, has, finished, that, time, allowance, the, most, widely, used, time, control, system, is, the, so, called, byoyomi, system, the, top, professional, go, matches, have, timekeepers, so, that, the, players, do, not, have, to, press, their, own, clocks, two, widely, used, variants, of, the, byoyomi, system, are, go, games, are, recorded, with, a, simple, coordinate, system, this, is, comparable, to, algebraic, chess, notation, except, that, go, stones, do, not, move, and, thus, require, only, one, coordinate, per, turn, coordinate, systems, include, purely, numerical, 4, 4, point, hybrid, k3, and, purely, alphabetical, the, smart, game, format, uses, alphabetical, coordinates, internally, but, most, editors, represent, the, board, with, hybrid, coordinates, as, this, reduces, confusion, alternatively, the, game, record, can, also, be, noted, by, writing, the, successive, moves, on, a, diagram, where, odd, numbers, mean, black, stones, even, numbers, mean, white, stones, or, conversely, when, playing, with, a, handicap, and, a, notation, like, 25, 22, in, the, margin, means, that, the, 25th, stone, was, played, at, the, same, location, as, the, 22nd, one, which, had, been, captured, in, the, meantime, the, japanese, word, kifu, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, a, game, record, in, unicode, go, stones, can, be, represented, with, black, and, white, circles, from, the, block, geometric, shapes, the, block, miscellaneous, symbols, includes, go, markers, that, were, likely, meant, for, mathematical, research, of, go, a, go, professional, is, a, professional, player, of, the, game, of, go, there, are, six, areas, with, professional, go, associations, these, are, china, chinese, weiqi, association, japan, nihon, ki, in, kansai, ki, in, south, korea, korea, baduk, association, taiwan, taiwan, chi, yuan, culture, foundation, the, united, states, aga, professional, system, and, europe, european, professional, system, although, the, game, was, developed, in, china, the, establishment, of, the, four, go, houses, by, tokugawa, ieyasu, at, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, shifted, the, focus, of, the, go, world, to, japan, state, sponsorship, allowing, players, to, dedicate, themselves, full, time, to, study, of, the, game, and, fierce, competition, between, individual, houses, resulted, in, a, significant, increase, in, the, level, of, play, during, this, period, the, best, player, of, his, generation, was, given, the, prestigious, title, meijin, master, and, the, post, of, godokoro, minister, of, go, of, special, note, are, the, players, who, were, dubbed, kisei, go, sage, the, only, three, players, to, receive, this, honor, were, d, saku, j, wa, and, sh, saku, all, of, the, house, hon, inb, after, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, and, the, meiji, restoration, period, the, go, houses, slowly, disappeared, and, in, 1924, the, nihon, ki, in, japanese, go, association, was, formed, top, players, from, this, period, often, played, newspaper, sponsored, matches, of, 2, 10, games, of, special, note, are, the, chinese, born, player, go, seigen, chinese, wu, qingyuan, who, scored, 80, in, these, matches, and, beat, down, most, of, his, opponents, to, inferior, handicaps, and, minoru, kitani, who, dominated, matches, in, the, early, 1930s, these, two, players, are, also, recognized, for, their, groundbreaking, work, on, new, opening, theory, shinfuseki, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, go, continued, to, be, dominated, by, players, trained, in, japan, notable, names, included, eio, sakata, rin, kaiho, born, in, taiwan, masao, kato, koichi, kobayashi, and, cho, chikun, born, cho, ch, i, hun, from, south, korea, top, chinese, and, korean, talents, often, moved, to, japan, because, the, level, of, play, there, was, high, and, funding, was, more, lavish, one, of, the, first, korean, players, to, do, so, was, cho, namchul, who, studied, in, the, kitani, dojo, 1937, 1944, after, his, return, to, korea, the, hanguk, kiwon, korea, baduk, association, was, formed, and, caused, the, level, of, play, in, south, korea, to, rise, significantly, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, china, the, game, declined, during, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 1976, but, quickly, recovered, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, bringing, chinese, players, such, as, nie, weiping, and, ma, xiaochun, on, par, with, their, japanese, and, south, korean, counterparts, the, chinese, weiqi, association, today, part, of, the, china, qiyuan, was, established, in, 1962, and, professional, dan, grades, started, being, issued, in, 1982, western, professional, go, began, in, 2012, with, the, american, go, association, s, professional, system, in, 2014, the, european, go, federation, followed, suit, and, started, their, professional, system, with, the, advent, of, major, international, titles, from, 1989, onward, it, became, possible, to, compare, the, level, of, players, from, different, countries, more, accurately, cho, hunhyun, of, south, korea, won, the, first, edition, of, the, quadrennial, ing, cup, in, 1989, his, disciple, lee, chang, ho, was, the, dominant, player, in, international, go, competitions, for, more, than, a, decade, spanning, much, of, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, he, is, also, credited, with, groundbreaking, works, on, the, endgame, cho, lee, and, other, south, korean, players, such, as, seo, bong, soo, yoo, changhyuk, and, lee, sedol, between, them, won, the, majority, of, international, titles, in, this, period, several, chinese, players, also, rose, to, the, top, in, international, go, from, 2000s, most, notably, ma, xiaochun, chang, hao, gu, li, and, ke, jie, as, of, 2016, japan, lags, behind, in, the, international, go, scene, historically, more, men, than, women, have, played, go, special, tournaments, for, women, exist, but, until, recently, men, and, women, did, not, compete, together, at, the, highest, levels, however, the, creation, of, new, open, tournaments, and, the, rise, of, strong, female, players, most, notably, rui, naiwei, have, in, recent, years, highlighted, the, strength, and, competitiveness, of, emerging, female, players, the, level, in, other, countries, has, traditionally, been, much, lower, except, for, some, players, who, had, preparatory, professional, training, in, east, asia, knowledge, of, the, game, has, been, scant, elsewhere, up, until, the, 20th, century, a, famous, player, of, the, 1920s, was, edward, lasker, it, was, not, until, the, 1950s, that, more, than, a, few, western, players, took, up, the, game, as, other, than, a, passing, interest, in, 1978, manfred, wimmer, became, the, first, westerner, to, receive, a, professional, player, s, certificate, from, an, east, asian, professional, go, association, in, 2000, american, michael, redmond, became, the, first, western, player, to, achieve, a, 9, dan, rank, it, is, possible, to, play, go, with, a, simple, paper, board, and, coins, plastic, tokens, or, white, beans, and, coffee, beans, for, the, stones, or, even, by, drawing, the, stones, on, the, board, and, erasing, them, when, captured, more, popular, midrange, equipment, includes, cardstock, a, laminated, particle, board, or, wood, boards, with, stones, of, plastic, or, glass, more, expensive, traditional, materials, are, still, used, by, many, players, the, most, expensive, go, sets, have, black, stones, carved, from, slate, and, white, stones, carved, from, translucent, white, shells, traditionally, meretrix, lamarckii, played, on, boards, carved, in, a, single, piece, from, the, trunk, of, a, tree, the, go, board, generally, referred, to, by, its, japanese, name, goban, typically, measures, between, 45, and, 48, cm, 18, and, 19, in, in, length, from, one, player, s, side, to, the, other, and, 42, to, 44, cm, 16, 1, 2, to, 17, 1, 4, in, in, width, chinese, boards, are, slightly, larger, as, a, traditional, chinese, go, stone, is, slightly, larger, to, match, the, board, is, not, square, there, is, a, 15, 14, ratio, in, length, to, width, because, with, a, perfectly, square, board, from, the, player, s, viewing, angle, the, perspective, creates, a, foreshortening, of, the, board, the, added, length, compensates, for, this, there, are, two, main, types, of, boards, a, table, board, similar, in, most, respects, to, other, gameboards, like, that, used, for, chess, and, a, floor, board, which, is, its, own, free, standing, table, and, at, which, the, players, sit, the, traditional, japanese, goban, is, between, 10, and, 18, cm, 3, 9, and, 7, 1, in, thick, and, has, legs, it, sits, on, the, floor, see, picture, it, is, preferably, made, from, the, rare, golden, tinged, kaya, tree, torreya, nucifera, with, the, very, best, made, from, kaya, trees, up, to, 700, years, old, more, recently, the, related, california, torreya, torreya, californica, has, been, prized, for, its, light, color, and, pale, rings, as, well, as, its, reduced, expense, and, more, readily, available, stock, the, natural, resources, of, japan, have, been, unable, to, keep, up, with, the, enormous, demand, for, the, slow, growing, kaya, trees, both, t, nucifera, and, t, californica, take, many, hundreds, of, years, to, grow, to, the, necessary, size, and, they, are, now, extremely, rare, raising, the, price, of, such, equipment, tremendously, as, kaya, trees, are, a, protected, species, in, japan, they, cannot, be, harvested, until, they, have, died, thus, an, old, growth, floor, standing, kaya, goban, can, easily, cost, in, excess, of, 10, 000, with, the, highest, quality, examples, costing, more, than, 60, 000, other, less, expensive, woods, often, used, to, make, quality, table, boards, in, both, chinese, and, japanese, dimensions, include, hiba, thujopsis, dolabrata, katsura, cercidiphyllum, japonicum, kauri, agathis, and, shin, kaya, various, varieties, of, spruce, commonly, from, alaska, siberia, and, china, s, yunnan, province, so, called, shin, kaya, is, a, potentially, confusing, merchant, s, term, shin, means, new, and, thus, shin, kaya, is, best, translated, faux, kaya, because, the, woods, so, described, are, biologically, unrelated, to, kaya, a, full, set, of, go, stones, goishi, usually, contains, 181, black, stones, and, 180, white, ones, a, 19, 19, grid, has, 361, points, so, there, are, enough, stones, to, cover, the, board, and, black, gets, the, extra, odd, stone, because, that, player, goes, first, however, it, may, happen, especially, in, beginners, games, that, many, back, and, forth, captures, empty, the, bowls, before, the, end, of, the, game, in, that, case, an, exchange, of, prisoners, allows, the, game, to, continue, traditional, japanese, stones, are, double, convex, and, made, of, clamshell, white, and, slate, black, the, classic, slate, is, nachiguro, stone, mined, in, wakayama, prefecture, and, the, clamshell, from, the, hamaguri, clam, meretrix, lusoria, or, the, korean, hard, clam, however, due, to, a, scarcity, in, the, japanese, supply, of, these, clams, the, stones, are, most, often, made, of, shells, harvested, from, mexico, historically, the, most, prized, stones, were, made, of, jade, often, given, to, the, reigning, emperor, as, a, gift, in, china, the, game, is, traditionally, played, with, single, convex, stones, made, of, a, composite, called, yunzi, the, material, comes, from, yunnan, province, and, is, made, by, sintering, a, proprietary, and, trade, secret, mixture, of, mineral, compounds, derived, from, the, local, stone, this, process, dates, to, the, tang, dynasty, and, after, the, knowledge, was, lost, in, the, 1920s, during, the, chinese, civil, war, was, rediscovered, in, the, 1960s, by, the, now, state, run, yunzi, company, the, material, is, praised, for, its, colors, its, pleasing, sound, as, compared, to, glass, or, to, synthetics, such, as, melamine, and, its, lower, cost, as, opposed, to, other, materials, such, as, slate, shell, the, term, yunzi, can, also, refer, to, a, single, convex, stone, made, of, any, material, however, most, english, language, go, suppliers, specify, yunzi, as, a, material, and, single, convex, as, a, shape, to, avoid, confusion, as, stones, made, of, yunzi, are, also, available, in, double, convex, while, synthetic, stones, can, be, either, shape, traditional, stones, are, made, so, that, black, stones, are, slightly, larger, in, diameter, than, white, this, is, to, compensate, for, the, optical, illusion, created, by, contrasting, colors, that, would, make, equal, sized, white, stones, appear, larger, on, the, board, than, black, stones, the, bowls, for, the, stones, are, shaped, like, a, flattened, sphere, with, a, level, underside, the, lid, is, loose, fitting, and, upturned, before, play, to, receive, stones, captured, during, the, game, chinese, bowls, are, slightly, larger, and, a, little, more, rounded, a, style, known, generally, as, go, seigen, japanese, kitani, bowls, tend, to, have, a, shape, closer, to, that, of, the, bowl, of, a, snifter, glass, such, as, for, brandy, the, bowls, are, usually, made, of, turned, wood, mulberry, is, the, traditional, material, for, japanese, bowls, but, is, very, expensive, wood, from, the, chinese, jujube, date, tree, which, has, a, lighter, color, it, is, often, stained, and, slightly, more, visible, grain, pattern, is, a, common, substitute, for, rosewood, and, traditional, for, go, seigen, style, bowls, other, traditional, materials, used, for, making, chinese, bowls, include, lacquered, wood, ceramics, stone, and, woven, straw, or, rattan, the, names, of, the, bowl, shapes, go, seigen, and, kitani, were, introduced, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, professional, player, janice, kim, as, homage, to, two, 20th, century, professional, go, players, by, the, same, names, of, chinese, and, japanese, nationality, respectively, who, are, referred, to, as, the, fathers, of, modern, go, the, traditional, way, to, place, a, go, stone, is, to, first, take, one, from, the, bowl, gripping, it, between, the, index, and, middle, fingers, with, the, middle, finger, on, top, and, then, placing, it, directly, on, the, desired, intersection, one, can, also, place, a, stone, on, the, board, and, then, slide, it, into, position, under, appropriate, circumstances, where, it, does, not, move, any, other, stones, it, is, considered, respectful, towards, white, for, black, to, place, the, first, stone, of, the, game, in, the, upper, right, hand, corner, because, of, symmetry, this, has, no, effect, on, the, game, s, outcome, it, is, considered, poor, manners, to, run, one, s, fingers, through, one, s, bowl, of, unplayed, stones, as, the, sound, however, soothing, to, the, player, doing, this, can, be, disturbing, to, one, s, opponent, similarly, clacking, a, stone, against, another, stone, the, board, or, the, table, or, floor, is, also, discouraged, however, it, is, permissible, to, emphasize, select, moves, by, striking, the, board, more, firmly, than, normal, thus, producing, a, sharp, clack, additionally, hovering, one, s, arm, over, the, board, usually, when, deciding, where, to, play, is, also, considered, rude, as, it, obstructs, the, opponent, s, view, of, the, board, manners, and, etiquette, are, extensively, discussed, in, the, classic, of, weiqi, in, thirteen, chapters, a, song, dynasty, manual, to, the, game, apart, from, the, points, above, it, also, points, to, the, need, to, remain, calm, and, honorable, in, maintaining, posture, and, knowing, the, key, specialised, terms, such, as, titles, of, common, formations, generally, speaking, much, attention, is, paid, to, the, etiquette, of, playing, as, much, as, to, winning, or, actual, game, technique, go, long, posed, a, daunting, challenge, to, computer, programmers, putting, forward, difficult, decision, making, tasks, an, intractable, search, space, and, an, optimal, solution, so, complex, it, appears, infeasible, to, directly, approximate, using, a, policy, or, value, function, prior, to, 2015, the, best, go, programs, only, managed, to, reach, amateur, dan, level, on, smaller, 9, 9, and, 13x13, boards, computer, programs, fared, better, and, were, able, to, compare, to, professional, players, many, in, the, field, of, artificial, intelligence, consider, go, to, require, more, elements, that, mimic, human, thought, than, chess, the, reasons, why, computer, programs, had, not, played, go, at, the, professional, dan, level, prior, to, 2016, include, it, was, not, until, august, 2008, that, a, computer, won, a, game, against, a, professional, level, player, at, a, handicap, of, 9, stones, the, greatest, handicap, normally, given, to, a, weaker, opponent, it, was, the, mogo, program, which, scored, this, first, victory, in, an, exhibition, game, played, during, the, us, go, congress, by, 2013, a, win, at, the, professional, level, of, play, was, accomplished, with, a, four, stone, advantage, in, october, 2015, google, deepmind, s, program, alphago, beat, fan, hui, the, european, go, champion, and, a, 2, dan, out, of, 9, dan, possible, professional, five, times, out, of, five, with, no, handicap, on, a, full, size, 19, 19, board, alphago, used, a, fundamentally, different, paradigm, than, earlier, go, programs, it, included, very, little, direct, instruction, and, mostly, used, deep, learning, where, alphago, played, itself, in, hundreds, of, millions, of, games, such, that, it, could, measure, positions, more, intuitively, in, march, 2016, google, next, challenged, lee, sedol, a, 9, dan, considered, the, top, player, in, the, world, in, the, early, 21st, century, to, a, five, game, match, leading, up, to, the, game, lee, sedol, and, other, top, professionals, were, confident, that, he, would, win, however, alphago, defeated, lee, in, four, of, the, five, games, after, having, already, lost, the, series, by, the, third, game, lee, won, the, fourth, game, describing, his, win, as, invaluable, in, may, 2017, alphago, beat, ke, jie, who, at, the, time, continuously, held, the, world, no, 1, ranking, for, two, years, winning, each, game, in, a, three, game, match, during, the, future, of, go, summit, in, october, 2017, deepmind, announced, a, significantly, stronger, version, called, alphago, zero, which, beat, the, previous, version, by, 100, games, to, 0, in, february, 2023, kellin, pelrine, an, amateur, american, go, player, won, 14, out, of, 15, games, against, a, top, ranked, ai, system, in, a, significant, victory, over, artificial, intelligence, pelrine, took, advantage, of, a, previously, unknown, flaw, in, the, go, computer, program, which, had, been, identified, by, another, computer, he, exploited, this, weakness, by, slowly, encircling, the, opponent, s, stones, and, distracting, the, ai, with, moves, in, other, parts, of, the, board, the, tactics, used, by, pelrine, have, highlighted, a, fundamental, flaw, in, the, deep, learning, systems, that, underpin, many, of, today, s, advanced, ai, although, the, ai, systems, can, understand, specific, situations, they, lack, the, ability, to, generalize, in, a, way, that, humans, find, easy, an, abundance, of, software, is, available, to, support, players, of, the, game, this, includes, programs, that, can, be, used, to, view, or, edit, game, records, and, diagrams, programs, that, allow, the, user, to, search, for, patterns, in, the, games, of, strong, players, and, programs, that, allow, users, to, play, against, each, other, over, the, internet, some, web, servers, provide, graphical, aids, like, maps, to, aid, learning, during, play, these, graphical, aids, may, suggest, possible, next, moves, indicate, areas, of, influence, highlight, vital, stones, under, attack, and, mark, stones, in, atari, or, about, to, be, captured, there, are, several, file, formats, used, to, store, game, records, the, most, popular, of, which, is, sgf, short, for, smart, game, format, programs, used, for, editing, game, records, allow, the, user, to, record, not, only, the, moves, but, also, variations, commentary, and, further, information, on, the, game, electronic, databases, can, be, used, to, study, life, and, death, situations, joseki, fuseki, and, games, by, a, particular, player, programs, are, available, that, give, players, pattern, searching, options, which, allow, players, to, research, positions, by, searching, for, high, level, games, in, which, similar, situations, occur, such, software, generally, lists, common, follow, up, moves, that, have, been, played, by, professionals, and, gives, statistics, on, win, loss, ratio, in, opening, situations, internet, based, go, servers, allow, access, to, competition, with, players, all, over, the, world, for, real,

technical, literature, and, study, material, go, and, its, strategies, have, been, the, subject, of, several, works, of, fiction, such, as, the, master, of, go, by, nobel, prize, winning, author, yasunari, kawabata, and, the, girl, who, played, go, by, shan, sa, other, books, have, used, go, as, a, theme, or, minor, plot, device, for, example, the, novel, shibumi, by, trevanian, centers, around, the, game, and, uses, go, metaphors, go, features, prominently, in, the, chung, kuo, series, of, novels, by, david, wingrove, being, the, favourite, game, of, the, main, villain, the, manga, japanese, comic, book, and, anime, series, hikaru, no, go, released, in, japan, in, 1998, had, a, large, impact, in, popularizing, go, among, young, players, both, in, japan, and, as, translations, were, released, abroad, similarly, go, has, been, used, as, a, subject, or, plot, device, in, film, such, as, pi, a, beautiful, mind, tron, legacy, knives, out, and, the, go, master, a, biopic, of, go, professional, go, seigen, 2013, s, t, ky, ni, kita, bakari, or, tokyo, newcomer, portrays, a, chinese, foreigner, go, player, moving, to, tokyo, in, king, hu, s, wuxia, film, the, valiant, ones, the, characters, are, color, coded, as, go, stones, black, or, other, dark, shades, for, the, chinese, white, for, the, japanese, invaders, go, boards, and, stones, are, used, by, the, characters, to, keep, track, of, soldiers, prior, to, battle, and, the, battles, themselves, are, structured, like, a, game, of, go, go, has, also, been, featured, as, a, plot, device, in, a, number, of, television, series, examples, include, starz, s, science, fiction, thriller, counterpart, which, is, rich, in, references, the, opening, itself, featuring, developments, on, a, go, board, and, includes, go, matches, accurately, played, relevant, to, the, plot, also, in, 2024, netflix, released, the, historical, fictional, korean, series, captivating, the, king, the, corporation, and, brand, atari, was, named, after, the, go, term, hedge, fund, manager, mark, spitznagel, used, go, as, his, main, investing, metaphor, in, his, investing, book, the, dao, of, capital, the, way, of, go, 8, ancient, strategy, secrets, for, success, in, business, and, life, by, troy, anderson, applies, go, strategy, to, business, go, an, asian, paradigm, for, business, strategy, by, miura, yasuyuki, a, manager, with, japan, airlines, uses, go, to, describe, the, thinking, and, behavior, of, business, men, a, 2004, review, of, literature, by, fernand, gobet, de, voogt, and, jean, retschitzki, shows, that, relatively, little, scientific, research, has, been, carried, out, on, the, psychology, of, go, compared, with, other, traditional, board, games, such, as, chess, computer, go, research, has, shown, that, given, the, large, search, tree, knowledge, and, pattern, recognition, are, more, important, in, go, than, in, other, strategy, games, such, as, chess, a, study, of, the, effects, of, age, on, go, playing, has, shown, that, mental, decline, is, milder, with, strong, players, than, with, weaker, players, according, to, the, review, of, gobet, and, colleagues, the, pattern, of, brain, activity, observed, with, techniques, such, as, pet, and, fmri, does, not, show, large, differences, between, go, and, chess, on, the, other, hand, a, study, by, xiangchuan, chen, et, al, showed, greater, activation, in, the, right, hemisphere, among, go, players, than, among, chess, players, but, the, research, was, inconclusive, because, strong, players, from, go, were, hired, while, very, weak, chess, players, were, hired, in, the, original, study, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, a, correlation, between, playing, board, games, and, reduced, risk, of, alzheimer, s, disease, and, dementia, arthur, mary, a, french, researcher, in, clinical, psychopathology, reports, on, his, psychotherapeutic, approaches, using, the, game, of, go, with, patients, in, private, practice, and, in, a, psychiatric, ward, drawing, on, neuroscience, research, and, employing, a, psychoanalytic, lacanian, and, phenomenological, approach, he, demonstrates, how, drives, are, expressed, on, the, goban, he, offers, some, suggestions, to, therapists, for, defining, ways, of, playing, go, that, lead, to, therapeutic, effects, in, formal, game, theory, terms, go, is, a, non, chance, combinatorial, game, with, perfect, information, informally, that, means, there, are, no, dice, used, and, decisions, or, moves, create, discrete, outcome, vectors, rather, than, probability, distributions, the, underlying, math, is, combinatorial, and, all, moves, via, single, vertex, analysis, are, visible, to, both, players, unlike, some, card, games, where, some, information, is, hidden, perfect, information, also, implies, sequence, players, can, theoretically, know, about, all, past, moves, other, game, theoretical, taxonomy, elements, include, the, facts, in, the, endgame, it, can, often, happen, that, the, state, of, the, board, consists, of, several, subpositions, that, do, not, interact, with, the, others, the, whole, board, position, can, then, be, considered, as, a, mathematical, sum, or, composition, of, the, individual, subpositions, it, is, this, property, of, go, endgames, that, led, john, horton, conway, to, the, discovery, of, surreal, numbers, in, combinatorial, game, theory, terms, go, is, a, zero, sum, perfect, information, partisan, deterministic, strategy, game, putting, it, in, the, same, class, as, chess, draughts, checkers, and, reversi, othello, the, game, emphasizes, the, importance, of, balance, on, multiple, levels, to, secure, an, area, of, the, board, it, is, good, to, play, moves, close, together, however, to, cover, the, largest, area, one, needs, to, spread, out, perhaps, leaving, weaknesses, that, can, be, exploited, playing, too, low, close, to, the, edge, secures, insufficient, territory, and, influence, yet, playing, too, high, far, from, the, edge, allows, the, opponent, to, invade, decisions, in, one, part, of, the, board, may, be, influenced, by, an, apparently, unrelated, situation, in, a, distant, part, of, the, board, for, example, ladders, can, be, broken, by, stones, at, an, arbitrary, distance, away, plays, made, early, in, the, game, can, shape, the, nature, of, conflict, a, hundred, moves, later, the, game, complexity, of, go, is, such, that, describing, even, elementary, strategy, fills, many, introductory, books, in, fact, numerical, estimates, show, that, the, number, of, possible, games, of, go, far, exceeds, the, number, of, atoms, in, the, observable, universe, go, also, contributed, to, the, development, of, combinatorial, game, theory, with, go, infinitesimals, being, a, specific, example, of, its, use, in, go, go, begins, with, an, empty, board, it, is, focused, on, building, from, the, ground, up, nothing, to, something, with, multiple, simultaneous, battles, leading, to, a, point, based, win, chess, is, tactical, rather, than, strategic, as, the, predetermined, strategy, is, to, trap, one, individual, piece, the, king, this, comparison, has, also, been, applied, to, military, and, political, history, with, scott, boorman, s, book, the, protracted, game, 1969, and, more, recently, robert, greene, s, book, the, 48, laws, of, power, 1998, exploring, the, strategy, of, the, chinese, communist, party, in, the, chinese, civil, war, through, the, lens, of, go, a, similar, comparison, has, been, drawn, among, go, chess, and, backgammon, perhaps, the, three, oldest, games, that, enjoy, worldwide, popularity, backgammon, is, a, man, vs, fate, contest, with, chance, playing, a, strong, role, in, determining, the, outcome, chess, with, rows, of, soldiers, marching, forward, to, capture, each, other, embodies, the, conflict, of, man, vs, man, because, the, handicap, system, tells, go, players, where, they, stand, relative, to, other, players, an, honestly, ranked, player, can, expect, to, lose, about, half, of, their, games, therefore, go, can, be, seen, as, embodying, the, quest, for, self, improvement, man, vs, self
