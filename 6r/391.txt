the, javelin, throw, is, a, track, and, field, event, where, the, javelin, a, spear, about, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, in, length, is, thrown, as, far, as, possible, the, javelin, thrower, gains, momentum, by, running, within, a, predetermined, area, javelin, throwing, is, an, event, of, both, the, men, s, decathlon, and, the, women, s, heptathlon, the, javelin, throw, was, added, to, the, ancient, olympic, games, as, part, of, the, pentathlon, in, 708, bc, it, included, two, events, one, for, distance, and, the, other, for, accuracy, in, hitting, a, target, the, javelin, was, thrown, with, the, aid, of, a, thong, ankyle, in, greek, that, was, wound, around, the, middle, of, the, shaft, athletes, held, the, javelin, by, the, ankyle, a, leather, strap, around, the, shaft, so, when, they, released, the, javelin, the, unwinding, of, the, thong, gave, the, javelin, a, spiral, trajectory, throwing, javelin, like, poles, into, targets, was, revived, in, germany, and, sweden, in, the, early, 1870s, in, sweden, these, poles, developed, into, the, modern, javelin, and, throwing, them, for, distance, became, a, common, event, there, and, in, finland, in, the, 1880s, the, rules, continued, to, evolve, over, the, next, decades, originally, javelins, were, thrown, with, no, run, up, and, holding, them, by, the, grip, at, the, center, of, gravity, was, not, always, mandatory, limited, run, ups, were, introduced, in, the, late, 1890s, and, soon, developed, into, the, modern, unlimited, run, up, 435, 436, sweden, s, eric, lemming, who, threw, his, first, world, best, 49, 32, metres, in, 1899, and, ruled, the, event, from, 1902, to, 1912, was, the, first, dominant, javelin, thrower, 436, 441, 478, when, the, men, s, javelin, was, introduced, as, an, olympic, discipline, at, the, 1906, intercalated, games, lemming, won, by, almost, nine, metres, and, broke, his, own, world, record, sweden, swept, the, first, four, places, as, finland, s, best, throwers, were, absent, and, the, event, had, yet, to, become, popular, in, any, other, country, 437, though, challenged, by, younger, talents, lemming, repeated, as, olympic, champion, in, 1908, and, 1912, his, eventual, best, mark, 62, 32, m, thrown, after, the, 1912, olympics, was, the, first, javelin, world, record, to, be, officially, ratified, by, the, international, association, of, athletics, federations, 436, 441, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, most, javelin, competitions, were, two, handed, the, implement, was, thrown, with, the, right, hand, and, separately, with, the, left, hand, and, the, best, marks, for, each, hand, were, added, together, competitions, for, the, better, hand, only, were, less, common, though, not, unknown, at, the, olympics, a, both, hands, contest, was, held, only, once, in, 1912, finland, swept, the, medals, ahead, of, lemming, 441, after, that, this, version, of, the, javelin, rapidly, faded, into, obscurity, together, with, similar, variations, of, the, shot, and, the, discus, sweden, s, yngve, h, ckner, with, his, total, of, 114, 28, m, from, 1917, was, the, last, official, both, hands, world, record, holder, another, early, variant, was, the, freestyle, javelin, in, which, holding, the, javelin, by, the, grip, at, the, center, of, gravity, was, not, mandatory, such, a, freestyle, competition, was, held, at, the, 1908, olympics, but, it, was, dropped, from, the, program, after, that, 478, hungary, s, m, r, k, cz, n, used, a, freestyle, end, grip, to, break, the, 60, metre, barrier, in, 1911, a, year, before, lemming, and, julius, saaristo, first, did, so, with, a, regular, grip, 440, 214, the, first, known, women, s, javelin, marks, were, recorded, in, finland, in, 1909, originally, women, threw, the, same, implement, as, men, a, lighter, shorter, javelin, for, women, was, introduced, in, the, 1920s, women, s, javelin, throw, was, added, to, the, olympic, program, in, 1932, mildred, babe, didrikson, of, the, united, states, became, the, first, champion, 479, for, a, long, time, javelins, were, made, of, solid, wood, typically, birch, with, a, steel, tip, the, hollow, highly, aerodynamic, held, javelin, invented, by, american, thrower, bud, held, and, developed, and, manufactured, by, his, brother, dick, was, introduced, in, the, 1950s, the, first, held, javelins, were, also, wooden, with, steel, tips, but, later, models, were, made, entirely, of, metal, 478, 479, these, new, javelins, flew, further, but, were, also, less, likely, to, land, neatly, point, first, as, a, response, to, the, increasingly, frequent, flat, or, ambiguously, flat, landings, experiments, with, modified, javelins, started, in, the, early, 1980s, the, resulting, designs, which, made, flat, landings, much, less, common, and, reduced, the, distances, thrown, became, official, for, men, starting, in, april, 1986, and, for, women, in, april, 1999, and, the, world, records, then, 104, 80, m, by, uwe, hohn, and, 80, 00, m, by, petra, felke, were, reset, the, current, as, of, 2017, men, s, world, record, is, held, by, jan, elezn, at, 98, 48, m, 1996, barbora, pot, kov, holds, the, women, s, world, record, at, 72, 28, m, 2008, of, the, 69, olympic, medals, that, have, been, awarded, in, the, men, s, javelin, 32, have, gone, to, competitors, from, norway, sweden, or, finland, finland, is, the, only, nation, to, have, swept, the, medals, at, a, currently, recognized, official, olympics, and, has, done, so, twice, in, 1920, and, 1932, in, addition, to, its, 1912, sweep, in, the, two, handed, javelin, in, 1920, finland, swept, the, first, four, places, which, is, no, longer, possible, as, only, three, entrants, per, country, are, allowed, finland, has, however, never, been, nearly, as, successful, in, the, women, s, javelin, 479, the, javelin, throw, has, been, part, of, the, decathlon, since, the, decathlon, was, introduced, in, the, early, 1910s, the, all, around, an, earlier, ten, event, contest, of, american, origin, did, not, include, the, javelin, throw, the, javelin, was, also, part, of, some, though, not, all, of, the, many, early, forms, of, women, s, pentathlon, and, has, always, been, included, in, the, heptathlon, after, it, replaced, the, pentathlon, in, 1981, the, size, shape, minimum, weight, and, center, of, gravity, of, the, javelin, are, all, defined, by, world, athletics, rules, in, international, competition, men, throw, a, javelin, between, 2, 6, and, 2, 7, m, 8, ft, 6, in, and, 8, ft, 10, in, in, length, and, 800, g, 28, oz, in, weight, and, women, throw, a, javelin, between, 2, 2, and, 2, 3, m, 7, ft, 3, in, and, 7, ft, 7, in, in, length, and, 600, g, 21, oz, in, weight, the, javelin, has, a, grip, about, 150, mm, 5, 9, in, wide, made, of, cord, and, located, at, the, javelin, s, center, of, gravity, 0, 9, to, 1, 06, m, 2, ft, 11, in, to, 3, ft, 6, in, from, the, javelin, tip, for, the, men, s, javelin, and, 0, 8, to, 0, 92, m, 2, ft, 7, in, to, 3, ft, 0, in, from, the, javelin, tip, for, the, women, s, javelin, unlike, the, other, throwing, events, shot, put, discus, and, hammer, the, technique, used, to, throw, the, javelin, is, dictated, by, world, athletics, rules, and, non, orthodox, techniques, are, not, permitted, the, javelin, must, be, held, at, its, grip, and, thrown, overhand, over, the, athlete, s, shoulder, or, upper, arm, further, the, athlete, is, prohibited, from, turning, completely, around, or, starting, with, their, back, facing, the, direction, of, the, throw, this, prevents, athletes, from, attempting, to, spin, and, hurl, the, javelin, sidearm, in, the, style, of, a, discus, throw, this, rule, was, put, in, place, when, a, group, of, athletes, began, experimenting, with, a, spin, technique, referred, to, as, free, style, on, 24, october, 1956, pentti, saarikoski, threw, 99, 52, m, 326, ft, 6, in, using, the, technique, holding, the, end, of, the, javelin, officials, were, so, afraid, of, the, out, of, control, nature, of, the, technique, that, the, practice, was, banned, through, these, rule, specifications, instead, of, being, confined, to, a, circle, javelin, throwers, have, a, runway, 4, m, 13, ft, wide, and, at, least, 30, m, 98, ft, in, length, ending, in, an, 8, m, 26, ft, radius, throwing, arc, from, which, their, throw, is, measured, athletes, typically, use, this, distance, to, gain, momentum, in, a, run, up, to, their, throw, like, the, other, throwing, events, the, competitor, may, not, leave, the, throwing, area, the, runway, until, after, the, implement, lands, the, need, to, come, to, a, stop, behind, the, throwing, arc, limits, both, how, close, the, athlete, can, come, to, the, line, before, the, release, as, well, as, the, maximum, speed, achieved, at, the, time, of, release, the, javelin, is, thrown, towards, a, 28, 96, circular, sector, that, is, centered, on, the, center, point, of, the, throwing, arc, the, angle, of, the, throwing, sector, 28, 96, provides, sector, boundaries, that, are, easy, to, construct, and, lay, out, on, a, field, a, throw, is, only, legal, if, the, tip, of, the, javelin, lands, within, this, sector, and, first, strikes, the, ground, before, any, other, part, of, the, javelin, the, distance, of, the, throw, is, measured, from, the, throwing, arc, to, the, point, where, the, tip, of, the, javelin, landed, rounded, down, to, the, nearest, centimetre, competition, rules, are, similar, to, other, throwing, events, a, round, consists, of, one, attempt, by, each, competitor, in, turn, and, competitions, typically, consist, of, three, to, six, rounds, the, competitor, with, the, longest, single, legal, throw, over, all, rounds, is, the, winner, in, case, of, a, tie, the, competitors, second, longest, throws, are, also, considered, competitions, involving, large, numbers, of, athletes, sometimes, use, a, cut, whereby, all, competitors, compete, in, the, first, three, rounds, but, only, those, who, are, currently, among, the, top, eight, or, have, achieved, some, minimum, distances, are, permitted, to, attempt, to, improve, on, their, distance, in, additional, rounds, typically, three, the, javelin, is, almost, always, thrown, outdoors, though, it, is, rarely, thrown, indoors, the, world, record, for, men, s, indoor, javelin, throw, is, 85, 78, metres, by, matti, n, rhi, in, 1996, on, 1, april, 1986, the, men, s, javelin, 800, grams, 1, 76, lb, was, redesigned, by, the, governing, body, the, iaaf, technical, committee, they, decided, to, change, the, rules, for, javelin, design, because, of, the, increasingly, frequent, flat, landings, and, the, resulting, discussions, and, protests, when, these, attempts, were, declared, valid, or, invalid, by, competition, judges, the, world, record, had, also, crept, up, to, a, potentially, dangerous, level, 104, 80, m, 343, 8, ft, by, uwe, hohn, with, throws, exceeding, 100, metres, it, was, becoming, difficult, to, safely, stage, the, competition, within, the, confines, of, a, stadium, infield, the, javelin, was, redesigned, so, that, the, centre, of, gravity, was, moved, 4, cm, 1, 6, in, forward, in, addition, the, surface, area, in, front, of, centre, of, gravity, was, reduced, while, the, surface, area, behind, the, centre, of, gravity, was, increased, this, had, an, effect, similar, to, that, produced, by, the, feathers, on, an, arrow, the, javelin, turns, into, the, relative, wind, this, relative, wind, appears, to, originate, from, the, ground, as, the, javelin, descends, thus, the, javelin, turns, to, face, the, ground, as, the, javelin, turns, into, the, wind, less, lift, is, generated, reducing, the, flight, distance, by, around, 10, but, also, causing, the, javelin, to, stick, in, the, ground, more, consistently, in, 1999, the, women, s, javelin, 600, grams, 1, 32, lb, was, similarly, redesigned, modifications, that, manufacturers, made, to, recover, some, of, the, lost, distance, by, increasing, tail, drag, using, holes, rough, paint, or, dimples, were, forbidden, at, the, end, of, 1991, and, performances, made, using, implements, with, such, modifications, removed, from, the, record, books, seppo, r, ty, had, achieved, a, world, record, of, 96, 96, m, 318, 1, ft, in, 1991, with, such, a, design, but, this, record, was, nullified, the, weight, of, the, javelin, in, the, under, 20, category, is, the, same, as, the, senior, level, unlike, other, throwing, events, javelin, allows, the, competitor, to, build, speed, over, a, considerable, distance, in, addition, the, core, and, upper, body, strength, is, necessary, to, deliver, the, implement, javelin, throwers, benefit, from, the, agility, and, athleticism, typically, associated, with, running, and, jumping, events, thus, the, athletes, share, more, physical, characteristics, with, sprinters, than, with, others, although, they, still, need, the, skill, of, heavier, throwing, athletes, traditional, free, weight, training, is, often, used, by, javelin, throwers, metal, rod, exercises, and, resistance, band, exercises, can, be, used, to, train, a, similar, action, to, the, javelin, throw, to, increase, power, and, intensity, without, proper, strength, and, flexibility, throwers, can, become, extremely, injury, prone, especially, in, the, shoulder, and, elbow, core, stability, can, help, in, the, transference, of, physical, power, and, force, from, the, ground, through, the, body, to, the, javelin, stretching, and, sprint, training, are, used, to, enhance, the, speed, of, the, athlete, at, the, point, of, release, and, subsequently, the, speed, of, the, javelin, at, release, a, javelin, can, reach, speeds, approaching, 113, km, h, 70, mph, the, javelin, throw, consists, of, three, separate, phases, the, run, up, the, transition, and, the, delivery, during, each, phase, the, position, of, the, javelin, changes, while, the, thrower, changes, his, or, her, muscle, recruitment, in, the, run, up, phase, as, luann, voza, states, your, arm, is, bent, and, kept, close, to, your, head, keeping, the, javelin, in, alignment, with, little, to, no, arm, movement, this, allows, the, thrower, s, bicep, to, contract, flexing, the, elbow, in, order, for, the, javelin, to, stay, up, high, the, thrower, s, deltoid, flexes, in, the, transition, phase, the, thrower, s, back, muscles, contract, as, the, javelin, is, brought, back, in, alignment, with, the, shoulder, with, the, thrower, s, palm, up, this, according, to, voza, stretches, your, pectoral, or, chest, muscles, from, there, a, stretch, reflex, an, involuntary, contraction, of, your, chest, helps, bring, your, throwing, arm, forward, with, increased, force, during, the, final, phase, the, rotation, of, the, shoulders, initiates, the, release, which, then, transfers, movement, through, the, triceps, muscles, wrists, and, fingers, to, extend, the, throwing, arm, forward, to, release, the, javelin, in, 1994, michael, torke, composed, javelin, commissioned, by, the, atlanta, committee, for, the, olympic, games, in, celebration, of, the, atlanta, symphony, orchestra, s, 50th, anniversary, season, in, conjunction, with, the, 1996, summer, olympics, javelin, throwers, have, been, selected, as, a, main, motif, in, numerous, collectors, coins, one, of, the, recent, samples, is, the, 5, finnish, 10th, iaaf, world, championships, in, athletics, commemorative, coin, minted, in, 2005, to, commemorate, the, 2005, world, championships, in, athletics, on, the, obverse, of, the, coin, a, javelin, thrower, is, depicted, on, the, reverse, legs, of, hurdle, runners, with, the, helsinki, olympic, stadium, tower, in, the, background, can, be, seen, tables, show, data, for, two, definitions, of, top, 25, the, top, 25, distances, and, the, top, 25, athletes, light, yellow, denotes, top, performance, for, athletes, in, the, top, 25, distances, white, denotes, lesser, performances, still, in, the, top, 25, distances, by, repeat, athletes, green, denotes, top, performance, only, for, other, top, 25, athletes, who, fall, outside, the, top, 25, distances, marks, set, using, dimpled, rough, tailed, javelins, manufactured, by, several, companies, were, nullified, effective, 20, september, 1991, 208, 209, a, new, model, was, introduced, in, 1986, and, all, records, started, fresh, a, new, model, was, introduced, in, 1999, and, all, records, started, fresh
