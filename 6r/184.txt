https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy
monogamy, m, n, m, i, m, nog, mee, is, a, relationship, of, two, individuals, in, which, they, form, a, mutual, and, exclusive, intimate, partnership, having, only, one, partner, at, any, one, time, whether, that, be, for, life, or, whether, that, be, serial, monogamy, contrasts, with, various, forms, of, non, monogamy, e, g, polygamy, or, polyamory, more, generally, the, term, is, used, to, describe, the, behavioral, ecology, and, sexual, selection, of, animal, mating, systems, referring, to, the, state, of, having, only, one, mate, at, any, one, given, time, in, a, human, cultural, context, monogamy, typically, refers, to, the, custom, of, two, individuals, regardless, of, orientation, committing, to, a, sexually, exclusive, relationship, the, word, monogamy, derives, from, the, greek, monos, one, and, gamos, marriage, referring, to, the, functional, social, behaviour, of, pair, bonding, the, term, can, then, be, subsequently, subclassified, by, context, dependent, relational, types, generally, there, are, four, intersecting, definitions, for, instance, biologists, biological, anthropologists, and, behavioral, ecologists, often, use, monogamy, in, the, sense, of, sexual, if, not, genetic, reproductive, exclusivity, when, cultural, or, social, anthropologists, and, other, social, scientists, use, the, term, monogamy, the, meaning, is, social, or, marital, monogamy, marital, monogamy, may, be, further, distinguished, between, defining, monogamy, across, cultures, can, be, difficult, because, of, different, cultural, assumptions, some, societies, believe, that, monogamy, requires, limiting, sexual, activity, to, a, single, partner, for, life, others, accept, or, endorse, pre, marital, sex, prior, to, marriage, some, societies, consider, sex, outside, of, marriage, or, spouse, swapping, to, be, socially, acceptable, some, consider, a, relationship, monogamous, even, if, partners, separate, and, move, to, a, new, monogamous, relationship, through, death, divorce, or, simple, dissolution, of, the, relationship, regardless, of, the, length, of, the, relationship, serial, monogamy, the, need, to, accurately, define, monogamy, was, highlighted, in, a, 2012, work, which, defined, practices, as, either, formal, or, informal, polyandry, the, researchers, found, 53, communities, studied, between, 1912, and, 2010, that, practiced, polyandry, in, which, women, have, multiple, male, partners, this, broader, definition, indicated, that, polyandry, was, more, common, worldwide, than, previously, believed, terminology, may, also, affect, how, data, on, polygamy, is, interpreted, while, the, genetic, record, indicates, that, genetic, monogamy, increased, within, the, last, 5, 000, 10, 000, years, the, form, of, prehistoric, non, monogamy, is, less, clear, a, lack, of, genetic, monogamy, could, be, interpreted, as, polygamy, despite, other, plausible, explanations, anthropological, observations, indicate, that, even, when, polygyny, is, accepted, in, the, community, the, majority, of, relationships, in, the, society, are, monogamous, in, practice, while, couples, remain, in, the, relationship, which, may, not, be, lifelong, thus, in, prehistoric, communities, and, communities, categorized, as, polygamous, short, or, long, term, serial, monogamy, may, be, the, most, common, practice, rather, than, a, lifelong, monogamous, bond, according, to, the, ethnographic, atlas, by, george, p, murdock, of, 1, 231, societies, from, around, the, world, noted, 186, were, monogamous, 453, had, occasional, polygyny, 588, had, more, frequent, polygyny, and, 4, had, polyandry, this, does, not, take, into, account, the, relative, population, of, each, of, the, societies, studied, the, actual, practice, of, polygamy, in, a, tolerant, society, may, actually, be, low, with, the, majority, of, aspirant, polygamists, practicing, de, facto, monogamous, marriage, divorce, and, remarriage, can, thus, result, in, serial, monogamy, i, e, multiple, marriages, but, only, one, legal, spouse, at, a, time, this, can, be, interpreted, as, a, form, of, plural, mating, as, are, those, societies, dominated, by, female, headed, families, in, the, caribbean, mauritius, and, brazil, where, there, is, frequent, rotation, of, unmarried, partners, in, all, these, account, for, 16, to, 24, of, the, monogamous, category, the, prevalence, of, sexual, monogamy, can, be, roughly, estimated, as, the, percentage, of, married, people, who, do, not, engage, in, extramarital, sex, the, standard, cross, cultural, sample, describes, the, amount, of, extramarital, sex, by, men, and, women, in, over, 50, pre, industrial, cultures, the, amount, of, extramarital, sex, by, men, is, described, as, universal, in, 6, cultures, moderate, in, 29, cultures, occasional, in, 6, cultures, and, uncommon, in, 10, cultures, the, amount, of, extramarital, sex, by, women, is, described, as, universal, in, 6, cultures, moderate, in, 23, cultures, occasional, in, 9, cultures, and, uncommon, in, 15, cultures, surveys, conducted, in, non, western, nations, 2001, also, found, cultural, and, gender, differences, in, extramarital, sex, a, study, of, sexual, behavior, in, thailand, tanzania, and, c, te, d, ivoire, suggests, about, 16, 34, of, men, engage, in, extramarital, sex, while, a, much, smaller, unreported, percentage, of, women, engage, in, extramarital, sex, studies, in, nigeria, have, found, around, 47, 53, of, men, and, to, 18, 36, of, women, engage, in, extramarital, sex, a, 1999, survey, of, married, and, cohabiting, couples, in, zimbabwe, reports, that, 38, of, men, and, 13, of, women, engaged, in, extra, couple, sexual, relationships, within, the, last, 12, months, many, surveys, asking, about, extramarital, sex, in, the, united, states, have, relied, on, convenience, samples, surveys, given, to, whoever, happens, to, be, easily, available, e, g, volunteer, college, students, or, volunteer, magazine, readers, convenience, samples, may, not, accurately, reflect, the, population, of, the, united, states, as, a, whole, which, can, cause, serious, biases, in, survey, results, sampling, bias, may, therefore, be, why, early, surveys, of, extramarital, sex, in, the, united, states, have, produced, widely, differing, results, such, early, studies, using, convenience, samples, 1974, 1983, 1993, reported, the, wide, ranges, of, 12, 26, of, married, women, and, 15, 43, of, married, men, engaged, in, extramarital, sex, three, studies, have, used, nationally, representative, samples, these, studies, in, 1994, and, 1997, found, that, about, 10, 15, of, women, and, 20, 25, of, men, engage, in, extramarital, sex, research, by, colleen, hoffon, of, 566, homosexual, male, couples, from, the, san, francisco, bay, area, 2010, found, that, 45, had, monogamous, relationships, however, the, human, rights, campaign, has, stated, based, on, a, rockway, institute, report, that, lgbt, young, people, want, to, spend, their, adult, life, in, a, long, term, relationship, raising, children, specifically, over, 80, of, the, homosexuals, surveyed, expected, to, be, in, a, monogamous, relationship, after, age, 30, the, incidence, of, genetic, monogamy, may, be, estimated, from, rates, of, extrapair, paternity, extrapair, paternity, is, when, offspring, raised, by, a, monogamous, pair, come, from, the, female, mating, with, another, male, rates, of, extrapair, paternity, have, not, been, extensively, studied, in, people, many, reports, of, extrapair, paternity, are, little, more, than, quotes, based, on, hearsay, anecdotes, and, unpublished, findings, simmons, firman, rhodes, and, peters, reviewed, 11, published, studies, of, extra, pair, paternity, from, various, locations, in, the, united, states, france, switzerland, the, united, kingdom, mexico, and, among, the, native, yanomami, indians, of, amazon, forest, in, south, america, the, rates, of, extrapair, paternity, ranged, from, 0, 03, to, 11, 8, although, most, of, the, locations, had, low, percentages, of, extrapair, paternity, the, median, rate, of, extrapair, paternity, was, 1, 8, a, separate, review, of, 17, studies, by, bellis, hughes, hughes, and, ashton, found, slightly, higher, rates, of, extrapair, paternity, the, rates, varied, from, 0, 8, to, 30, in, these, studies, with, a, median, rate, of, 3, 7, extrapair, paternity, a, range, of, 1, 8, to, 3, 7, extrapair, paternity, implies, a, range, of, 96, to, 98, genetic, monogamy, although, the, incidence, of, genetic, monogamy, may, vary, from, 70, to, 99, in, different, cultures, or, social, environments, a, large, percentage, of, couples, remain, genetically, monogamous, during, their, relationships, a, review, paper, surveying, 67, other, studies, reported, rates, of, extrapair, paternity, in, different, societies, ranging, from, 0, 4, to, over, 50, covert, illegitimacy, is, a, situation, which, arises, when, someone, who, is, presumed, to, be, a, child, s, father, or, mother, is, in, fact, not, the, biological, father, or, mother, frequencies, as, high, as, 30, are, sometimes, assumed, in, the, media, but, research, by, sociologist, michael, gilding, traced, these, overestimates, back, to, an, informal, remark, at, a, 1972, conference, the, detection, of, unsuspected, illegitimacy, can, occur, in, the, context, of, medical, genetic, screening, in, genetic, family, name, research, and, in, immigration, testing, such, studies, show, that, covert, illegitimacy, is, in, fact, less, than, 10, among, the, sampled, african, populations, less, than, 5, among, the, sampled, native, american, and, polynesian, populations, less, than, 2, of, the, sampled, middle, eastern, population, and, generally, 1, 2, among, european, samples, pedigree, errors, are, a, well, known, source, of, error, in, medical, studies, when, attempts, are, made, to, try, to, study, medical, afflictions, and, their, genetic, components, it, becomes, very, important, to, understand, non, paternity, rates, and, pedigree, errors, there, are, numerous, software, packages, and, procedures, that, exist, for, correcting, research, data, for, pedigree, errors, monogamy, exists, in, many, societies, around, the, world, resulting, in, extensive, scientific, research, which, tries, to, understand, how, these, marriage, systems, might, have, evolved, in, any, species, there, are, three, main, aspects, that, combine, to, promote, a, monogamous, mating, system, paternal, care, resource, access, and, mate, choice, however, in, humans, the, main, theoretical, sources, of, monogamy, are, paternal, care, and, extreme, ecological, stresses, paternal, care, should, be, particularly, important, in, humans, due, to, the, extra, nutritional, requirement, of, having, larger, brains, and, the, lengthier, developmental, period, therefore, the, evolution, of, monogamy, could, be, a, reflection, of, this, increased, need, for, bi, parental, care, similarly, monogamy, should, evolve, in, areas, of, ecological, stress, because, male, reproductive, success, should, be, higher, if, their, resources, are, focused, on, ensuring, offspring, survival, rather, than, searching, for, other, mates, due, to, the, extreme, sociality, and, increased, intelligence, of, humans, homo, sapiens, have, solved, many, problems, that, generally, lead, to, monogamy, such, as, those, mentioned, above, for, example, monogamy, is, certainly, correlated, with, paternal, care, as, shown, by, marlowe, but, not, caused, by, it, because, humans, diminish, the, need, for, bi, parental, care, through, the, aid, of, siblings, and, other, family, members, in, rearing, the, offspring, furthermore, human, intelligence, and, material, culture, allows, for, better, adaptation, to, different, and, rougher, ecological, areas, thus, reducing, the, causation, and, even, correlation, of, monogamous, marriage, and, extreme, climates, however, some, scientists, argue, that, monogamy, evolved, by, reducing, within, group, conflict, thus, giving, certain, groups, a, competitive, advantage, against, less, monogamous, groups, paleoanthropology, and, genetic, studies, offer, two, perspectives, on, when, monogamy, evolved, in, the, human, species, paleoanthropologists, offer, tentative, evidence, that, monogamy, may, have, started, very, early, in, human, history, whereas, genetic, studies, suggest, that, monogamy, might, have, increased, much, more, recently, less, than, 10, 000, to, 20, 000, years, ago, paleoanthropological, estimates, of, the, time, frame, for, the, evolution, of, monogamy, are, primarily, based, on, the, level, of, sexual, dimorphism, seen, in, the, fossil, record, because, in, general, the, reduced, male, male, competition, seen, in, monogamous, mating, results, in, reduced, sexual, dimorphism, according, to, reno, et, al, the, sexual, dimorphism, of, australopithecus, afarensis, a, human, ancestor, from, approximately, 3, 9, 3, 0, million, years, ago, was, within, the, modern, human, range, based, on, dental, and, postcranial, morphology, although, careful, not, to, say, that, this, indicates, monogamous, mating, in, early, hominids, the, authors, do, say, that, reduced, levels, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, a, afarensis, do, not, imply, that, monogamy, is, any, less, probable, than, polygyny, however, gordon, green, and, richmond, claim, that, in, examining, postcranial, remains, a, afarensis, is, more, sexually, dimorphic, than, modern, humans, and, chimpanzees, with, levels, closer, to, those, of, orangutans, and, gorillas, furthermore, homo, habilis, living, approximately, 2, 3, mya, is, the, most, sexually, dimorphic, early, hominid, plavcan, and, van, schaik, conclude, their, examination, of, this, controversy, by, stating, that, overall, sexual, dimorphism, in, australopithecines, is, not, indicative, of, any, behavioral, implications, or, mating, systems, currently, the, oldest, ethnic, group, in, africa, the, continent, where, homo, sapiens, species, emerged, is, the, san, people, of, southern, africa, most, san, are, monogamous, but, if, a, hunter, is, able, to, obtain, enough, food, he, can, afford, to, have, a, second, wife, as, well, the, monogamy, practiced, by, this, ethnic, group, is, the, serial, monogamy, despite, the, human, ability, to, avoid, sexual, and, genetic, monogamy, social, monogamy, still, forms, under, many, different, conditions, but, most, of, those, conditions, are, consequences, of, cultural, processes, these, cultural, processes, may, have, nothing, to, do, with, relative, reproductive, success, for, example, anthropologist, jack, goody, s, comparative, study, utilizing, the, ethnographic, atlas, demonstrated, that, monogamy, is, part, of, a, cultural, complex, found, in, the, broad, swath, of, eurasian, societies, from, japan, to, ireland, that, practice, social, monogamy, sexual, monogamy, and, dowry, i, e, diverging, devolution, that, allow, property, to, be, inherited, by, children, of, both, sexes, goody, demonstrates, a, statistical, correlation, between, this, cultural, complex, and, the, development, of, intensive, plough, agriculture, in, those, areas, drawing, on, the, work, of, ester, boserup, goody, notes, that, the, sexual, division, of, labour, varies, in, intensive, plough, agriculture, and, extensive, shifting, horticulture, in, plough, agriculture, farming, is, largely, men, s, work, and, is, associated, with, private, property, marriage, tends, to, be, monogamous, to, keep, the, property, within, the, nuclear, family, close, family, endogamy, are, the, preferred, marriage, partners, to, keep, property, within, the, group, a, molecular, genetic, study, of, global, human, genetic, diversity, argued, that, sexual, polygyny, was, typical, of, human, reproductive, patterns, until, the, shift, to, sedentary, farming, communities, approximately, 10, 000, to, 5, 000, years, ago, in, europe, and, asia, and, more, recently, in, africa, and, the, americas, a, further, study, drawing, on, the, ethnographic, atlas, showed, a, statistical, correlation, between, increasing, size, of, the, society, the, belief, in, high, gods, to, support, human, morality, and, monogamy, a, survey, of, other, cross, cultural, samples, has, confirmed, that, the, absence, of, the, plough, was, the, only, predictor, of, polygamy, although, other, factors, such, as, high, male, mortality, in, warfare, in, non, state, societies, and, pathogen, stress, in, state, societies, had, some, impact, betzig, postulated, that, culture, society, can, also, be, a, source, of, social, monogamy, by, enforcing, it, through, rules, and, laws, set, by, third, party, actors, usually, in, order, to, protect, the, wealth, or, power, of, the, elite, for, example, augustus, caesar, encouraged, marriage, and, reproduction, to, force, the, aristocracy, to, divide, their, wealth, and, power, among, multiple, heirs, but, the, aristocrats, kept, their, socially, monogamous, legitimate, children, to, a, minimum, to, ensure, their, legacy, while, having, many, extra, pair, copulations, similarly, according, to, betzig, the, christian, church, enforced, monogamy, because, wealth, passed, to, the, closest, living, legitimate, male, relative, often, resulting, in, the, wealthy, oldest, brother, being, without, a, male, heir, thus, the, wealth, and, power, of, the, family, would, pass, to, the, celibate, younger, brother, of, the, church, in, both, of, these, instances, the, rule, making, elite, used, cultural, processes, to, ensure, greater, reproductive, fitness, for, themselves, and, their, offspring, leading, to, a, larger, genetic, influence, in, future, generations, according, to, b, s, low, culture, would, appear, to, have, a, much, larger, impact, on, monogamy, in, humans, than, the, biological, forces, that, are, important, for, non, human, animals, other, theorists, use, cultural, factors, influencing, reproductive, success, to, explain, monogamy, during, times, of, major, economic, demographic, transitions, investing, more, in, fewer, offspring, social, monogamy, not, polygyny, increases, reproductive, success, by, ensuring, the, offspring, themselves, have, enough, initial, wealth, to, be, successful, this, is, seen, in, both, england, and, sweden, during, the, industrial, revolution, and, is, currently, being, seen, in, the, modernization, of, rural, ethiopia, similarly, in, modern, industrialized, societies, fewer, yet, better, invested, offspring, i, e, social, monogamy, can, provide, a, reproductive, advantage, over, social, polygyny, but, this, still, allows, for, serial, monogamy, and, extra, pair, copulations, karol, wojty, a, later, pope, john, paul, ii, in, his, book, love, and, responsibility, postulated, that, monogamy, as, an, institutional, union, of, two, people, being, in, love, with, one, another, was, an, embodiment, of, an, ethical, personalistic, norm, and, thus, the, only, means, of, making, true, human, love, possible, some, writers, have, suggested, that, monogamy, may, solve, the, problems, they, view, as, associated, with, non, monogamy, and, hypergamy, such, as, inceldom, alexandra, kollontai, in, make, way, for, the, winged, eros, argues, that, monogamy, is, an, artifact, of, capitalist, concepts, of, property, and, inheritance, and, wrote, the, social, aims, of, the, working, class, are, not, affected, one, bit, by, whether, love, takes, the, form, of, a, long, and, official, union, or, is, expressed, in, a, temporary, relationship, the, ideology, of, the, working, class, does, not, place, any, formal, limits, on, love, later, modern, love, always, sins, because, it, absorbs, the, thoughts, and, feelings, of, loving, hearts, and, isolates, the, loving, pair, from, the, collective, in, the, future, society, such, a, separation, will, not, only, become, superfluous, but, also, psychologically, inconceivable, one, of, the, tenets, of, the, new, proletarian, morality, is, mutual, recognition, of, the, rights, of, the, other, of, the, fact, that, one, does, not, own, the, heart, and, soul, of, the, other, the, sense, of, property, encouraged, by, bourgeois, culture, recent, anthropological, data, suggest, that, the, modern, concept, of, life, long, monogamy, has, been, in, place, for, only, the, last, 1, 000, years, genetic, evidence, has, demonstrated, that, a, greater, proportion, of, men, began, contributing, to, the, genetic, pool, between, 5, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, i, e, there, was, an, increase, in, women, reproducing, with, different, men, rather, than, multiple, women, reproducing, with, the, same, man, which, suggests, that, reproductive, monogamy, became, more, common, at, that, time, this, would, correspond, to, the, neolithic, agricultural, revolution, during, this, time, formerly, nomadic, societies, began, to, claim, and, settle, land, for, farming, leading, to, the, advent, of, property, ownership, and, therefore, inheritance, men, would, therefore, seek, to, ensure, that, their, land, would, go, to, direct, descendants, and, had, a, vested, interest, in, limiting, the, sexual, activities, of, their, reproductive, partners, it, is, possible, that, the, concept, of, marriage, and, permanent, monogamy, evolved, at, this, time, see, also, cultural, arguments, above, more, recent, genetic, data, has, clarified, that, in, most, regions, throughout, history, a, smaller, proportion, of, men, contributed, to, human, genetic, history, compared, to, women, this, could, occur, if, male, mortality, outpaced, female, mortality, this, cannot, be, assumed, with, the, available, evidence, if, an, equal, number, of, men, and, women, are, born, and, survive, to, reproduce, however, this, would, indicate, that, historically, only, a, subset, of, men, fathered, children, and, did, so, with, multiple, women, and, may, suggest, that, many, men, either, did, not, procreate, or, did, not, have, children, that, survived, to, create, modern, ancestors, this, circumstance, could, occur, for, several, reasons, but, there, are, three, common, interpretations, the, serial, monogamy, interpretation, of, genetic, history, would, be, congruent, with, other, findings, such, as, the, fact, that, humans, form, pair, bonds, although, not, necessarily, for, life, and, that, human, fathers, invest, in, at, least, the, early, upbringing, of, their, children, serial, monogamy, would, also, be, consistent, with, the, existence, of, a, honeymoon, period, a, period, of, intense, interest, in, a, single, sexual, partner, with, less, interest, in, other, women, which, may, help, to, keep, men, invested, in, staying, with, the, mother, of, their, child, for, this, period, when, reciprocated, this, honeymoon, period, lasts, 18, months, to, three, years, in, most, cases, this, would, correspond, to, the, period, necessary, to, bring, a, child, to, relative, independence, in, the, traditionally, small, interdependent, communal, societies, of, pre, neolithic, humans, before, they, settled, into, more, separate, agricultural, communities, while, genetic, evidence, typically, displays, a, bias, towards, a, smaller, number, of, men, reproducing, with, more, women, some, regions, or, time, periods, have, shown, the, opposite, in, a, 2019, investigation, musharoff, et, al, applied, modern, techniques, to, the, 1000, genomes, project, phase, 3, high, coverage, complete, genomics, whole, genome, dataset, they, found, that, the, southern, han, chinese, had, a, male, bias, 45, female, indicating, that, women, were, likely, to, reproduce, with, multiple, men, this, region, is, known, for, its, lack, of, a, concept, of, paternity, and, for, a, sense, of, female, equality, or, superiority, the, musharoff, study, also, found, a, male, bias, in, europeans, 20, female, during, an, out, of, africa, migration, event, that, may, have, increased, the, number, of, men, successfully, reproducing, with, women, perhaps, by, replenishing, the, genetic, pool, in, europe, the, study, did, confirm, a, more, typical, female, bias, in, yorubans, 63, female, europeans, 84, punjabis, 82, and, peruvians, 56, according, to, other, studies, coupling, began, or, evolved, gradually, towards, monogamy, since, millions, of, years, ago, anthropologists, characterize, human, beings, as, mildly, polygynous, or, monogamous, with, polygynous, tendencies, this, slight, inclination, towards, polygamy, is, reinforced, by, the, low, rate, of, polygamy, even, in, polygamist, societies, less, than, five, percent, of, men, marry, more, than, one, woman, in, approximately, half, of, polygynous, societies, this, slight, inclination, towards, men, reproducing, with, a, small, number, of, women, is, also, seen, in, genetic, evidence, depending, on, the, period, of, history, the, average, man, with, modern, descendents, appears, to, have, had, children, with, between, 1, 5, women, 70, 000, years, ago, to, 3, 3, women, 45, 000, years, ago, except, in, east, asia, this, rate, varied, dramatically, by, era, possibly, due, to, male, mortality, environmental, conditions, food, availability, and, other, influences, on, mortality, and, migration, patterns, these, rates, may, be, consistent, with, a, society, that, practices, serial, monogamy, however, there, was, a, temporary, but, sharp, decrease, in, the, ratio, during, the, start, of, the, neolithic, resolution, where, the, average, man, with, modern, descendants, had, children, with, 17, women, circa, 8, 000, years, ago, given, the, dramatic, cultural, shifts, towards, sedentary, agriculture, at, the, time, this, is, speculated, to, represent, a, dramatic, change, from, a, community, based, society, towards, the, hoarding, of, power, and, resources, more, consistent, with, a, harem, model, however, the, rapid, movement, back, towards, 4, 5, women, per, man, after, this, dip, accompanied, by, evidence, for, the, move, towards, monogamy, as, the, agricultural, revolution, progressed, may, suggest, a, dramatic, unknown, factor, such, as, catastrophic, male, mortality, the, historical, record, offers, contradictory, evidence, on, the, development, and, extent, of, monogamy, as, a, social, practice, laura, betzig, argues, that, in, the, six, large, highly, stratified, early, states, commoners, were, generally, monogamous, but, that, elites, practiced, de, facto, polygyny, those, states, included, mesopotamia, egypt, aztec, mexico, inca, peru, india, and, china, monogamy, has, appeared, in, some, traditional, tribal, societies, such, as, the, andamanese, karen, in, burma, sami, and, ket, in, northern, eurasia, and, the, pueblo, indians, of, the, united, states, apparently, unrelated, to, the, development, of, the, christian, monogamous, paradigm, both, the, babylonian, and, assyrian, families, were, monogamous, in, principle, but, not, entirely, so, in, practice, since, polygyny, was, frequently, practiced, by, the, rulers, in, the, patriarchal, society, of, mesopotamia, the, nuclear, family, was, called, a, house, in, order, to, build, a, house, a, man, was, supposed, to, marry, one, woman, and, if, she, did, not, provide, him, with, offspring, he, could, take, a, second, wife, the, code, of, hammurabi, states, that, he, loses, his, right, to, do, so, if, the, wife, herself, gives, him, a, slave, as, concubine, according, to, old, assyrian, texts, he, could, be, obliged, to, wait, for, two, or, three, years, before, he, was, allowed, to, take, another, wife, the, position, of, the, second, wife, was, that, of, a, slave, girl, in, respect, to, the, first, wife, as, many, marriage, contracts, explicitly, state, although, an, egyptian, man, was, free, to, marry, several, women, at, a, time, and, some, wealthy, men, from, old, and, middle, kingdoms, did, have, more, than, one, wife, monogamy, was, the, norm, there, may, have, been, some, exceptions, e, g, a, nineteenth, dynasty, official, stated, as, proof, of, his, love, to, his, deceased, wife, that, he, had, stayed, married, to, her, since, their, youth, even, after, he, had, become, very, successful, p, leiden, i, 371, this, may, suggest, that, some, men, abandoned, first, wives, of, a, low, social, status, and, married, women, of, higher, status, in, order, to, further, their, careers, although, even, then, they, lived, with, only, one, wife, egyptian, women, had, the, right, to, ask, for, a, divorce, if, their, husband, took, a, second, wife, many, tomb, reliefs, testify, to, the, monogamous, character, of, egyptian, marriages, officials, are, usually, accompanied, by, a, supportive, wife, his, wife, x, his, beloved, is, the, standard, phrase, identifying, wives, in, tomb, inscriptions, the, instruction, texts, belonging, to, wisdom, literature, e, g, instruction, of, ptahhotep, or, instruction, of, any, support, fidelity, to, monogamous, marriage, life, calling, the, wife, a, lady, of, the, house, the, instruction, of, ankhsheshonq, suggests, that, it, is, wrong, to, abandon, a, wife, because, she, is, not, capable, of, pregnancy, as, against, betzig, s, contention, that, monogamy, evolved, as, a, result, of, christian, socio, economic, influence, in, the, west, monogamy, appeared, widespread, in, the, ancient, middle, east, much, earlier, in, israel, s, pre, christian, era, an, essentially, monogamous, ethos, underlay, the, jewish, creation, story, gn, 2, and, the, last, chapter, of, proverbs, during, the, second, temple, period, 530, bce, to, 70, ce, apart, from, an, economic, situation, which, supported, monogamy, even, more, than, in, earlier, period, the, concept, of, mutual, fidelity, between, husband, and, wife, was, a, quite, common, reason, for, strictly, monogamous, marriages, some, marriage, documents, explicitly, expressed, a, desire, for, the, marriage, to, remain, monogamous, examples, of, these, documents, were, found, in, elephantine, they, resemble, those, found, in, neighbouring, assyria, and, babylonia, study, shows, that, ancient, middle, east, societies, though, not, strictly, monogamous, were, practically, at, least, on, commoners, level, monogamous, halakha, of, the, dead, sea, sect, saw, prohibition, of, polygamy, as, coming, from, the, pentateuch, damascus, document, 4, 20, 5, 5, one, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, christianity, adopted, a, similar, attitude, cf, 1, tm, 3, 2, 12, tt, 1, 6, which, conformed, with, jesus, approach, michael, coogan, in, contrast, states, that, polygyny, continued, to, be, practised, well, into, the, biblical, period, and, it, is, attested, among, jews, as, late, as, the, second, century, ce, under, judges, and, the, monarchy, old, restrictions, went, into, disuse, especially, among, royalty, though, the, books, of, samuel, and, kings, which, cover, entire, period, of, monarchy, record, only, one, instance, of, commoner, polygamy, that, of, samuel, s, father, the, wisdom, e, g, book, of, wisdom, which, provides, a, picture, of, the, society, sirach, proverbs, qohelet, portray, a, woman, in, a, strictly, monogamous, family, cf, pr, 5, 15, 19, qo, 9, 9, si, 26, 1, 4, and, eulogy, of, perfect, wife, proverbs, 31, 10, 31, the, book, of, tobias, speaks, solely, of, monogamous, marriages, also, prophets, have, in, front, of, their, eyes, monogamous, marriage, as, an, image, of, the, relationship, of, god, and, israel, cf, ho, 2, 4f, jer, 2, 2, is, 50, 1, 54, 6, 7, 62, 4, 5, ez, 16, roland, de, vaux, states, that, it, is, clear, that, the, most, common, form, of, marriage, in, israel, was, monogamy, the, mishnah, and, the, baraitot, clearly, reflect, a, monogamist, viewpoint, within, judaism, yevamot, 2, 10, etc, some, sages, condemned, marriage, to, two, wives, even, for, the, purpose, of, procreation, ketubot, 62b, r, ammi, an, amora, states, whoever, takes, a, second, wife, in, addition, to, his, first, one, shall, divorce, the, first, and, pay, her, kettubah, yevamot, 65a, roman, customs, which, prohibited, polygamy, may, have, enhanced, such, an, attitude, especially, after, 212, ad, when, all, the, jews, became, roman, citizens, however, some, jews, continued, to, practice, bigamy, e, g, up, to, medieval, times, in, egypt, and, europe, fourth, century, roman, law, forbade, jews, to, contract, plural, marriages, a, synod, convened, by, gershom, ben, judah, around, 1000, ce, banned, polygamy, among, ashkenazi, and, sephardic, jews, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, were, monogamous, in, the, sense, that, men, were, not, allowed, to, have, more, than, one, wife, or, to, cohabit, with, concubines, during, marriage, as, john, paul, ii, interpreted, the, dialogue, between, jesus, and, the, pharisees, gospel, of, matthew, 19, 3, 8, christ, emphasized, the, primordial, beauty, of, monogamic, spousal, love, described, in, the, book, of, genesis, 1, 26, 31, 2, 4, 25, whereby, a, man, and, woman, by, their, nature, are, each, ready, to, be, a, beautifying, total, and, personal, gift, to, one, another, jesus, avoids, entangling, himself, in, juridical, or, casuistic, controversies, instead, he, appeals, twice, to, the, beginning, by, doing, so, he, clearly, refers, to, the, relevant, words, of, genesis, which, his, interlocutors, also, know, by, heart, it, clearly, leads, the, interlocutors, to, reflect, about, the, way, in, which, in, the, mystery, of, creation, man, was, formed, precisely, as, male, and, female, in, order, to, understand, correctly, the, normative, meaning, of, the, words, of, genesis, western, european, societies, established, monogamy, as, their, marital, norm, monogamous, marriage, is, normative, and, is, legally, enforced, in, most, developed, countries, laws, prohibiting, polygyny, were, adopted, in, japan, 1880, china, 1953, india, 1955, and, nepal, 1963, polyandry, is, illegal, in, most, countries, the, women, s, rights, movements, seek, to, make, monogamy, the, only, legal, form, of, marriage, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 1979, adopted, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, article, 16, of, which, requires, nations, to, give, women, and, men, equal, rights, in, marriage, polygamy, is, viewed, as, inconsistent, with, the, article, as, it, gives, men, the, right, of, multiple, wives, but, not, to, women, the, united, nations, has, established, the, committee, on, the, elimination, of, discrimination, against, women, cedaw, to, monitor, the, progress, of, nations, implementing, the, convention, the, founders, of, communism, determined, that, monogamous, marriage, inherently, oppressed, women, and, therefore, had, no, place, in, communist, society, friedrich, engels, stated, that, compulsory, monogamy, could, only, lead, to, increased, prostitution, and, general, immorality, with, the, benefits, of, restricting, capital, and, solidifying, the, class, structure, as, he, spelled, out, in, the, origin, of, the, family, private, property, and, the, state, 1884, the, first, class, antagonism, which, appears, in, history, coincides, with, the, development, of, the, antagonism, between, man, and, woman, in, monogamian, marriage, and, the, first, class, oppression, with, that, of, the, female, sex, by, the, male, he, wellbeing, and, development, of, the, one, group, are, attained, by, the, misery, and, repression, of, the, other, the, monogamous, family, is, distinguished, from, the, pairing, family, by, the, far, greater, durability, of, wedlock, which, can, no, longer, be, dissolved, at, the, pleasure, of, either, party, as, a, rule, it, is, only, the, man, who, can, still, dissolve, it, and, cast, off, his, wife, however, the, communist, revolutionaries, in, china, chose, to, take, the, western, viewpoint, of, monogamy, as, giving, women, and, men, equal, rights, in, marriage, the, newly, formed, communist, government, established, monogamy, as, the, only, legal, form, of, marriage, the, 1950, marriage, law, called, for, sweeping, changes, in, many, areas, of, family, life, it, forbade, any, arbitrary, and, compulsory, form, of, marriage, that, would, be, based, on, the, superiority, of, men, and, would, ignore, women, s, interests, the, new, democratic, marriage, system, was, based, on, the, free, choice, of, couples, monogamy, equal, rights, for, both, sexes, and, the, protection, of, the, lawful, interests, of, women, it, abolished, the, begetting, of, male, offspring, as, the, principal, purpose, of, marriage, and, weakened, kinship, ties, which, reduced, the, pressure, on, women, to, bear, many, children, especially, sons, with, arranged, marriages, prohibited, young, women, could, choose, their, own, marriage, partners, share, the, financial, cost, of, setting, up, a, new, household, and, have, equal, status, in, household, and, family, decision, making, the, government, then, initiated, an, extensive, campaign, of, marriage, law, education, working, jointly, with, the, communist, party, women, s, federations, trade, unions, the, armed, forces, schools, and, other, organizations, the, african, union, has, adopted, the, protocol, on, the, rights, of, women, in, africa, the, maputo, protocol, while, the, protocol, does, not, suggest, making, polygamous, marriage, illegal, article, 6, does, state, that, monogamy, is, encouraged, as, the, preferred, form, of, marriage, and, that, the, rights, of, women, in, marriage, and, family, including, in, polygamous, marital, relationships, are, promoted, and, protected, the, protocol, entered, into, force, on, 25, november, 2005, recent, discoveries, have, led, biologists, to, talk, about, the, three, varieties, of, monogamy, social, monogamy, sexual, monogamy, and, genetic, monogamy, the, distinction, between, these, three, are, important, to, the, modern, understanding, of, monogamy, monogamous, pairs, of, animals, are, not, always, sexually, exclusive, many, animals, that, form, pairs, to, mate, and, raise, offspring, regularly, engage, in, sexual, activities, with, partners, other, than, their, primary, mate, this, is, called, extra, pair, copulation, sometimes, these, extra, pair, sexual, activities, lead, to, offspring, genetic, tests, frequently, show, that, some, of, the, offspring, raised, by, a, monogamous, pair, come, from, the, female, mating, with, an, extra, pair, male, partner, these, discoveries, have, led, biologists, to, adopt, new, ways, of, talking, about, monogamy, social, monogamy, refers, to, a, male, and, female, s, social, living, arrangement, e, g, shared, use, of, a, territory, behaviour, indicative, of, a, social, pair, and, or, proximity, between, a, male, and, female, without, inferring, any, sexual, interactions, or, reproductive, patterns, in, humans, social, monogamy, equals, monogamous, marriage, sexual, monogamy, is, defined, as, an, exclusive, sexual, relationship, between, a, female, and, a, male, based, on, observations, of, sexual, interactions, finally, the, term, genetic, monogamy, is, used, when, dna, analyses, can, confirm, that, a, female, male, pair, reproduce, exclusively, with, each, other, a, combination, of, terms, indicates, examples, where, levels, of, relationships, coincide, e, g, sociosexual, and, sociogenetic, monogamy, describe, corresponding, social, and, sexual, and, social, and, genetic, monogamous, relationships, respectively, reichard, 2003, p, 4, whatever, makes, a, pair, of, animals, socially, monogamous, does, not, necessarily, make, them, sexually, or, genetically, monogamous, social, monogamy, sexual, monogamy, and, genetic, monogamy, can, occur, in, different, combinations, social, monogamy, does, not, always, involve, marriage, in, humans, a, married, couple, is, almost, always, a, socially, monogamous, couple, but, couples, who, choose, to, cohabit, without, getting, married, can, also, be, socially, monogamous, the, popular, science, author, matt, ridley, in, his, book, the, red, queen, sex, and, the, evolution, of, human, nature, described, the, human, mating, system, as, monogamy, plagued, by, adultery, serial, monogamy, is, a, mating, practice, in, which, individuals, may, engage, in, sequential, monogamous, pairings, or, in, terms, of, humans, when, men, or, women, can, marry, another, partner, but, only, after, ceasing, to, be, married, to, the, previous, partner, serial, monogamy, may, effectively, resemble, polygyny, in, its, reproductive, consequences, because, both, men, and, women, are, able, to, utilize, both, sexes, reproductive, lifespan, through, repeated, marriages, serial, monogamy, may, also, refer, to, sequential, sexual, relationships, irrespective, of, marital, status, a, pair, of, humans, may, remain, sexually, exclusive, or, monogamous, until, the, relationship, has, ended, and, then, each, may, go, on, to, form, a, new, exclusive, pairing, with, a, different, partner, this, pattern, of, serial, monogamy, is, common, among, people, in, western, cultures, evolutionary, theory, predicts, that, males, would, be, apt, to, seek, more, mating, partners, than, females, because, they, obtain, higher, reproductive, benefits, from, such, a, strategy, men, with, more, serial, marriages, are, likely, to, have, more, children, than, men, with, only, one, spouse, whereas, the, same, is, not, true, of, women, with, consecutive, spouses, a, study, done, in, 1994, found, that, remarried, men, often, had, a, larger, age, difference, from, their, spouses, than, men, who, were, married, for, the, first, time, suggesting, that, serial, monogamy, helps, some, men, extract, a, longer, reproductive, window, from, their, spouses, serial, monogamy, has, always, been, closely, linked, to, divorce, practices, whenever, procedures, for, obtaining, divorce, have, been, simple, and, easy, serial, monogamy, has, been, found, as, divorce, has, continued, to, become, more, accessible, more, individuals, have, availed, themselves, of, it, and, many, go, on, to, remarry, barry, schwartz, author, of, the, paradox, of, choice, why, more, is, less, further, suggests, that, western, culture, s, inundation, of, choice, has, devalued, relationships, based, on, lifetime, commitments, and, singularity, of, choice, it, has, been, suggested, however, that, high, mortality, rates, in, centuries, past, accomplished, much, the, same, result, as, divorce, enabling, remarriage, of, one, spouse, and, thus, serial, monogamy, according, to, danish, scholar, miriam, k, zeitzen, anthropologists, treat, serial, monogamy, in, which, divorce, and, remarriage, occur, as, a, form, of, polygamy, as, it, also, can, establish, a, series, of, households, that, may, continue, to, be, tied, by, shared, paternity, and, shared, income, as, such, they, are, similar, to, the, household, formations, created, through, divorce, and, serial, monogamy, monogamy, is, one, of, several, mating, systems, observed, in, animals, however, a, pair, of, animals, may, be, socially, monogamous, without, necessarily, being, sexually, or, genetically, monogamous, social, monogamy, sexual, monogamy, and, genetic, monogamy, can, occur, in, different, combinations, social, monogamy, refers, to, the, overtly, observed, living, arrangement, whereby, a, male, and, female, share, territory, and, engage, in, behaviour, indicative, of, a, social, pair, but, does, not, imply, any, particular, sexual, fidelity, or, reproductive, pattern, the, extent, to, which, social, monogamy, is, observed, in, animals, varies, across, taxa, with, over, 90, percent, of, avian, species, being, socially, monogamous, compared, to, only, 3, percent, of, mammalian, species, and, up, to, 15, percent, of, primate, species, social, monogamy, has, also, been, observed, in, reptiles, fish, and, insects, sexual, monogamy, is, defined, as, an, exclusive, sexual, relationship, between, a, female, and, a, male, based, on, observations, of, sexual, interactions, however, scientific, analyses, can, test, for, paternity, for, example, by, dna, paternity, testing, or, by, fluorescent, pigment, powder, tracing, of, females, to, track, physical, contact, this, type, of, analysis, can, uncover, reproductively, successful, sexual, pairings, or, physical, contact, genetic, monogamy, refers, to, dna, analyses, confirming, that, a, female, male, pair, reproduce, exclusively, with, each, other, the, incidence, of, sexual, monogamy, appears, quite, rare, in, other, parts, of, the, animal, kingdom, it, is, becoming, clear, that, even, animals, that, are, overtly, socially, monogamous, engage, in, extra, pair, copulations, for, example, while, over, 90, of, birds, are, socially, monogamous, on, average, 30, or, more, of, the, baby, birds, in, any, nest, sired, by, someone, other, than, the, resident, male, patricia, adair, gowaty, has, estimated, that, out, of, 180, different, species, of, socially, monogamous, songbirds, only, 10, are, sexually, monogamous, offspring, are, far, more, successful, when, both, the, male, and, the, female, members, of, the, social, pair, contribute, food, resources, the, highest, known, frequency, of, reproductively, successful, extra, pair, copulations, are, found, among, fairywrens, malurus, splendens, and, malurus, cyaneus, where, more, than, 65, of, chicks, are, fathered, by, males, outside, the, supposed, breeding, pair, this, discordantly, low, level, of, genetic, monogamy, has, been, a, surprise, to, biologists, and, zoologists, as, social, monogamy, can, no, longer, be, assumed, to, determine, how, genes, are, distributed, in, a, species, elacatinus, also, widely, known, as, neon, gobies, also, exhibit, social, monogamy, hetereosexual, pairs, of, fish, belonging, to, the, genus, elacatinus, remain, closely, associated, during, both, reproductive, and, non, reproductive, periods, and, often, reside, in, same, cleaning, station, to, serve, client, fish, fish, of, this, genus, frequently, mate, with, a, new, partner, after, they, are, widowed, socially, monogamous, species, are, scattered, throughout, the, animal, kingdom, a, few, insects, a, few, fish, about, nine, tenths, of, birds, and, a, few, mammals, are, socially, monogamous, there, is, even, a, parasitic, worm, schistosoma, mansoni, that, in, its, female, male, pairings, in, the, human, body, is, monogamous, the, diversity, of, species, with, social, monogamy, suggests, that, it, is, not, inherited, from, a, common, ancestor, but, instead, evolved, independently, in, many, different, species, the, low, occurrence, of, social, monogamy, in, placental, mammals, has, been, claimed, to, be, related, to, the, presence, or, absence, of, estrus, or, oestrus, the, duration, of, sexual, receptivity, of, a, female, this, however, does, not, explain, why, estrus, females, generally, mate, with, any, proximate, male, nor, any, correlation, between, sexual, and, social, monogamy, birds, which, are, notable, for, a, high, incidence, of, social, monogamy, do, not, have, estrus, the, prairie, vole, is, an, animal, example, for, its, monogamous, social, behaviour, since, the, male, is, usually, socially, faithful, to, the, female, and, shares, in, the, raising, of, pups, the, woodland, vole, is, also, usually, monogamous, another, species, from, the, same, genus, the, meadow, vole, has, promiscuously, mating, males, and, scientists, have, changed, adult, male, meadow, voles, behaviour, to, resemble, that, of, prairie, voles, in, experiments, in, which, a, single, gene, was, introduced, into, the, brain, by, a, virus, the, behaviour, is, influenced, by, the, number, of, repetitions, of, a, particular, string, of, microsatellite, dna, male, prairie, voles, with, the, longest, dna, strings, spend, more, time, with, their, mates, and, pups, than, male, prairie, voles, with, shorter, strings, however, other, scientists, have, disputed, the, gene, s, relationship, to, monogamy, and, cast, doubt, on, whether, the, human, version, plays, an, analogous, role, physiologically, pair, bonding, behavior, has, been, shown, to, be, connected, to, vasopressin, dopamine, and, oxytocin, levels, with, the, genetic, influence, apparently, arising, via, the, number, of, receptors, for, these, substances, in, the, brain, the, pair, bonding, behavior, has, also, been, shown, in, experiments, to, be, strongly, modifiable, by, administering, some, of, these, substances, directly, the, north, american, microtine, rodent, s, vole, complex, social, structure, and, social, behavior, has, provided, unique, opportunities, to, study, the, underlying, neural, bases, for, monogamy, and, social, attachment, data, from, studies, using, the, microtus, ochrogaster, or, prairie, vole, indicate, that, the, neuroendocrine, hormones, oxytocin, in, female, prairie, voles, and, vasopressin, in, male, prairie, voles, play, a, central, role, in, the, development, of, affiliative, connections, during, mating, the, effects, of, intracerebroventricular, administration, of, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, have, been, shown, to, promote, affiliative, behavior, in, the, prairie, vole, but, not, in, similar, but, non, monogamous, montane, voles, this, difference, in, neuropeptide, effect, is, attributed, to, the, location, density, and, distribution, of, ot, and, avp, receptors, only, in, the, prairie, voles, are, ot, and, avp, receptors, located, along, the, mesolimbic, dopamine, reward, pathway, presumably, conditioning, the, voles, to, their, mates, odor, while, consolidating, the, social, memory, of, the, mating, episode, this, finding, highlights, the, role, of, genetic, evolution, in, altering, the, neuroanatomical, distribution, of, receptors, resulting, in, certain, neural, circuits, becoming, sensitive, to, changes, in, neuropeptides
