there, are, seven, players, in, the, water, from, each, team, at, one, time, there, are, six, players, that, play, out, and, one, goalkeeper, unlike, most, common, team, sports, there, is, little, positional, play, field, players, will, often, fill, several, positions, throughout, the, game, as, situations, demand, these, positions, usually, consist, of, a, center, forward, a, center, back, the, two, wing, players, and, the, two, drivers, players, who, are, skilled, in, all, positions, of, offense, or, defense, are, called, utility, players, utility, players, tend, to, come, off, of, the, bench, though, this, is, not, absolute, certain, body, types, are, more, suited, for, particular, positions, and, left, handed, players, are, especially, coveted, on, the, right, hand, side, of, the, field, allowing, teams, to, launch, two, sided, attacks, the, offensive, positions, include, one, center, forward, also, called, a, set, hole, set, center, setter, hole, or, 2, meter, man, located, on, or, near, the, 2, meter, roughly, in, the, center, of, the, goal, two, wings, located, on, or, near, the, 2, meter, just, outside, of, the, goal, posts, respectively, two, drivers, also, called, flats, located, on, or, near, the, 5, meter, roughly, at, the, goal, posts, respectively, and, one, point, usually, just, behind, the, 5, meter, roughly, in, the, center, of, the, goal, respectively, positioned, farthest, from, the, goal, the, wings, drivers, and, point, are, often, called, the, perimeter, players, while, the, hole, set, directs, play, there, is, a, typical, numbering, system, for, these, positions, in, u, s, ncaa, men, s, division, one, polo, beginning, with, the, offensive, wing, to, the, opposing, goalie, s, right, side, is, called, one, the, flat, in, a, counter, clockwise, from, one, is, called, two, moving, along, in, the, same, direction, the, point, player, is, three, the, next, flat, is, four, the, final, wing, is, five, and, the, hole, set, is, called, six, additionally, the, position, in, which, a, player, is, can, give, advantages, based, on, a, player, s, handedness, to, improve, a, shooting, or, passing, angle, for, example, the, right, wing, is, often, left, handed, the, center, sets, up, in, front, of, the, opposing, team, s, goalie, and, scores, the, most, individually, especially, during, lower, level, play, where, flats, do, not, have, the, required, strength, to, effectively, shoot, from, outside, or, to, penetrate, and, then, pass, to, teammates, like, the, point, guard, in, basketball, or, center, midfield, player, in, soccer, the, center, s, position, nearest, to, the, goal, allows, explosive, shots, from, close, range, defensive, positions, are, often, the, same, but, just, switched, from, offence, to, defence, for, example, the, centre, forward, or, hole, set, who, directs, the, attack, on, offence, on, defence, is, known, as, hole, d, also, known, as, set, guard, hole, guard, hole, check, pit, defence, or, two, metre, defence, and, guards, the, opposing, team, s, centre, forward, also, called, the, hole, defence, can, be, played, man, to, man, or, in, zones, such, as, a, 2, 4, four, defenders, along, the, goal, line, it, can, also, be, played, as, a, combination, of, the, two, in, what, is, known, as, an, m, drop, defence, in, which, the, point, defender, moves, away, sloughs, off, his, man, into, a, zone, in, order, to, better, defend, the, centre, position, in, this, defence, the, two, wing, defenders, split, the, area, furthest, from, the, goal, allowing, them, a, clearer, lane, for, the, counter, attack, if, their, team, recovers, the, ball, the, goalkeeper, has, the, main, role, in, blocking, shots, against, the, goal, as, well, as, guiding, and, informing, their, defense, of, imposing, threats, and, gaps, in, the, defense, the, goalkeeper, usually, begins, the, offensive, play, by, passing, the, ball, across, the, pool, to, an, attacker, it, is, not, unusual, for, a, goalkeeper, to, make, an, assisting, pass, to, a, goal, on, a, break, away, the, goalkeeper, is, given, several, privileges, above, those, of, the, other, players, but, only, within, the, five, meter, area, in, front, of, their, own, goal, in, general, a, foul, that, would, cause, an, ejection, of, a, field, player, might, bring, on, a, five, metre, shot, on, the, goalkeeper, also, if, a, goalkeeper, pushes, the, ball, under, water, the, action, will, not, be, punished, with, a, turnover, like, with, field, players, but, with, a, penalty, shot, the, most, basic, positional, set, up, is, known, as, a, 3, 3, so, called, because, there, are, two, lines, in, front, of, the, opponent, s, goal, another, set, up, used, more, by, professional, teams, is, known, as, an, arc, umbrella, or, mushroom, perimeter, players, form, the, shape, of, an, arc, around, the, goal, with, the, hole, set, as, the, handle, or, stalk, yet, another, option, for, offensive, set, is, called, a, 4, 2, or, double, hole, there, are, two, center, forward, offensive, players, in, front, of, the, goal, double, hole, is, most, often, used, in, man, up, situations, or, when, the, defense, has, only, one, skilled, hole, d, or, to, draw, in, a, defender, and, then, pass, out, to, a, perimeter, player, for, a, shot, kick, out, another, albeit, less, common, offense, is, the, motion, c, sometimes, nicknamed, washing, machine, offence, in, which, two, weak, side, to, the, right, of, the, goal, for, right, handed, players, perimeter, players, set, up, as, a, wing, and, a, flat, the, remaining, four, players, swim, in, square, pattern, in, which, a, player, swims, from, the, point, to, the, hole, and, then, out, to, the, strong, side, wing, the, wing, moves, to, the, flat, and, the, flat, to, the, point, the, weak, side, wing, and, flat, then, control, the, tempo, of, play, and, try, to, make, passes, into, the, player, driving, towards, the, centre, forward, who, can, then, either, shoot, or, pass, this, form, of, offence, is, used, when, no, dominate, hole, set, is, available, or, the, hole, defence, is, too, strong, it, is, also, seen, much, more, often, in, women, s, water, polo, where, teams, may, lack, a, player, of, sufficient, size, or, strength, to, set, up, in, the, centre, forward, the, best, advantage, to, this, system, is, it, makes, man, coverage, much, more, difficult, for, the, defender, and, allows, the, offence, to, control, the, game, tempo, better, once, the, players, are, set, up, the, main, drawback, is, this, constant, motion, can, be, very, tiring, as, well, as, somewhat, predictable, as, to, where, the, next, pass, is, going, to, go, when, the, offence, takes, possession, of, the, ball, the, strategy, is, to, advance, the, ball, down, the, field, of, play, and, to, score, a, goal, players, can, move, the, ball, by, throwing, it, to, a, teammate, or, swimming, with, the, ball, in, front, of, them, dribbling, if, an, attacker, uses, their, arm, to, push, away, a, defending, player, and, free, up, space, for, a, pass, or, shot, the, referee, will, rule, a, turnover, and, the, defence, will, take, possession, of, the, ball, if, an, attacker, advances, inside, the, 2, metre, line, without, the, ball, or, before, the, ball, is, inside, the, 2, metre, area, they, are, ruled, offside, and, the, ball, is, turned, over, to, the, defence, this, is, often, overlooked, if, the, attacker, is, well, to, the, side, of, the, pool, or, when, the, ball, is, at, the, other, side, of, the, pool, the, key, to, the, offence, is, to, accurately, pass, or, set, the, ball, into, the, centre, forward, or, hole, set, positioned, directly, in, front, of, the, goal, the, hole, any, field, player, may, throw, the, hole, set, a, wet, pass, a, wet, pass, is, one, that, hits, the, water, just, outside, the, hole, set, s, reach, a, dry, pass, may, also, be, used, this, is, where, the, hole, set, receives, the, ball, directly, in, his, hand, and, then, attempts, a, shot, at, the, cage, this, pass, is, much, more, difficult, because, if, the, pass, is, not, properly, caught, the, officials, will, be, likely, to, call, an, offensive, foul, resulting, in, a, change, of, ball, possession, the, hole, set, attempts, to, take, possession, of, the, ball, to, shoot, at, the, goal, or, to, draw, a, foul, from, his, defender, a, minor, foul, is, called, if, his, defender, called, the, hole, d, attempts, to, impede, movement, before, the, hole, set, has, possession, the, referee, indicates, the, foul, with, one, short, whistle, blow, and, points, one, hand, to, the, spot, of, the, foul, and, the, other, hand, in, the, direction, of, the, attack, of, the, team, to, whom, the, free, throw, has, been, awarded, the, hole, set, then, has, a, reasonable, amount, of, time, typically, about, three, seconds, there, is, no, fina, rule, on, this, issue, to, re, commence, play, by, making, a, free, pass, to, one, of, the, other, players, the, defensive, team, cannot, hinder, the, hole, set, until, the, free, throw, has, been, taken, but, the, hole, set, cannot, shoot, a, goal, once, the, foul, has, been, awarded, until, the, ball, has, been, played, by, at, least, one, other, player, if, the, hole, set, attempts, a, goal, without, the, free, throw, the, goal, is, not, counted, and, the, defence, takes, possession, of, the, ball, unless, the, shot, is, made, outside, the, 5, metre, line, as, soon, as, the, hole, set, has, a, free, pass, the, other, attacking, players, attempt, to, swim, or, drive, away, from, their, defenders, towards, the, goal, the, players, at, the, flat, position, will, attempt, to, set, a, screen, also, known, as, a, pick, for, the, driver, if, a, driver, gets, free, from, a, defender, the, player, calls, for, the, pass, from, the, hole, set, and, attempts, a, shot, at, the, goal, if, a, defender, interferes, with, a, free, throw, holds, or, sinks, an, attacker, who, is, not, in, possession, or, splashes, water, into, the, face, of, an, opponent, the, defensive, player, is, excluded, from, the, game, for, twenty, seconds, known, as, a, kick, out, or, an, ejection, the, attacking, team, typically, positions, 4, players, on, the, 2, metre, line, and, 2, players, on, 5, metre, line, 4, 2, passing, the, ball, around, until, an, open, player, attempts, a, shot, other, formations, include, a, 3, 3, two, lines, of, three, attackers, each, or, arc, attackers, make, an, arc, in, front, of, the, goal, and, one, offensive, player, sits, in, the, hole, or, pit, in, front, of, the, goal, the, five, defending, players, try, to, pressure, the, attackers, block, shots, and, prevent, a, goal, being, scored, for, the, 20, seconds, while, they, are, a, player, down, the, other, defenders, can, only, block, the, ball, with, one, hand, to, help, the, goalkeeper, the, defensive, player, is, allowed, to, return, immediately, if, the, offence, scores, or, if, the, defence, recovers, the, ball, before, the, twenty, seconds, expires, on, defence, the, players, work, to, regain, possession, of, the, ball, and, to, prevent, a, goal, in, their, own, net, the, defence, attempts, to, knock, away, or, steal, the, ball, from, the, offense, or, to, commit, a, foul, in, order, to, stop, an, offensive, player, from, taking, a, goal, shot, the, defender, attempts, to, stay, between, the, attacker, and, the, goal, a, position, known, as, inside, water, even, with, good, backup, from, the, rest, of, the, defenders, stopping, attacks, can, prove, very, difficult, if, the, goalkeeper, remains, in, the, middle, of, the, goal, the, most, defensible, position, is, along, a, semicircular, line, connecting, the, goalposts, and, extending, out, in, the, centre, depending, on, the, ball, carrier, s, location, the, goalkeeper, is, positioned, along, that, semicircle, roughly, a, metre, out, of, the, goal, to, reduce, the, attacker, s, shooting, angle, the, goalkeeper, stops, using, their, hands, to, tread, water, once, the, opponent, enters, at, about, the, 7, metre, mark, and, starts, to, lift, their, upper, body, using, the, eggbeater, technique, to, prepare, to, block, the, shot, finally, the, goalkeeper, tries, to, block, the, ball, down, which, is, often, hard, for, the, longer, reaches, but, prevents, an, offensive, rebound, and, second, shot, as, is, the, case, with, other, defensive, players, a, goalkeeper, who, aggressively, fouls, an, attacker, in, position, to, score, can, be, charged, with, a, penalty, shot, for, the, other, team, the, goalkeeper, can, also, be, ejected, for, twenty, seconds, if, a, major, foul, is, committed, also, inside, the, five, metre, mark, the, goalie, can, swing, at, the, ball, with, a, closed, fist, without, being, penalised, if, an, offensive, player, such, as, the, centre, forward, has, possession, of, the, ball, in, front, of, the, goal, the, defensive, player, tries, to, steal, the, ball, or, to, keep, the, centre, from, shooting, or, passing, if, the, defender, cannot, achieve, these, aims, he, may, commit, a, foul, intentionally, the, hole, set, then, is, given, a, free, throw, but, must, pass, off, the, ball, to, another, offensive, player, rather, than, making, a, direct, shot, at, the, goal, defensive, perimeter, players, may, also, intentionally, cause, a, minor, foul, and, then, move, toward, the, goal, away, from, their, attacker, who, must, take, a, free, throw, this, technique, called, sloughing, allows, the, defense, an, opportunity, to, double, team, the, hole, set, and, possibly, steal, the, inbound, pass, the, referee, may, refrain, from, declaring, a, foul, if, in, his, judgment, this, would, give, the, advantage, to, the, offender, s, team, this, is, known, as, the, advantage, rule, water, polo, is, a, contact, sport, with, little, protective, gear, besides, swimsuits, and, caps, with, ear, protectors, and, thus, injuries, are, common, among, the,
