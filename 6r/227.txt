intersex, people, are, individuals, born, with, any, of, several, sex, characteristics, including, chromosome, patterns, gonads, or, genitals, that, according, to, the, office, of, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, do, not, fit, typical, binary, notions, of, male, or, female, bodies, sex, assignment, at, birth, usually, aligns, with, a, child, s, external, genitalia, the, number, of, births, with, ambiguous, genitals, is, in, the, range, of, 1, 4, 500, 1, 2, 000, 0, 02, 0, 05, other, conditions, involve, the, development, of, atypical, chromosomes, gonads, or, hormones, some, persons, may, be, assigned, and, raised, as, a, girl, or, boy, but, then, identify, with, another, gender, later, in, life, while, most, continue, to, identify, with, their, assigned, sex, the, number, of, births, where, the, baby, is, intersex, has, been, reported, differently, depending, on, who, reports, and, which, definition, of, intersex, is, used, anne, fausto, sterling, and, her, book, co, authors, claim, the, prevalence, of, nondimorphic, sexual, development, in, humans, might, be, as, high, as, 1, 7, however, a, response, published, by, leonard, sax, reports, this, figure, includes, conditions, such, as, late, onset, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, and, klinefelter, syndrome, which, most, clinicians, do, not, recognize, as, intersex, sax, states, if, the, term, intersex, is, to, retain, any, meaning, the, term, should, be, restricted, to, those, conditions, in, which, chromosomal, sex, is, inconsistent, with, phenotypic, sex, or, in, which, the, phenotype, is, not, classifiable, as, either, male, or, female, stating, the, prevalence, of, intersex, is, about, 0, 018, one, in, 5, 500, births, about, 100, times, less, than, fausto, sterling, s, estimate, terms, used, to, describe, intersex, people, are, contested, and, change, over, time, and, place, intersex, people, were, previously, referred, to, as, hermaphrodites, or, congenital, eunuchs, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, some, medical, experts, devised, new, nomenclature, in, an, attempt, to, classify, the, characteristics, that, they, had, observed, the, first, attempt, to, create, a, taxonomic, classification, system, of, intersex, conditions, intersex, people, were, categorized, as, either, having, true, hermaphroditism, female, pseudohermaphroditism, or, male, pseudohermaphroditism, these, terms, are, no, longer, used, and, terms, including, the, word, hermaphrodite, are, considered, to, be, misleading, stigmatizing, and, scientifically, specious, in, reference, to, humans, in, biology, the, term, hermaphrodite, is, used, to, describe, an, organism, that, can, produce, both, male, and, female, gametes, some, people, with, intersex, traits, use, the, term, intersex, and, some, prefer, other, language, in, clinical, settings, the, term, disorders, of, sex, development, dsd, has, been, used, since, 2006, a, shift, in, language, considered, controversial, since, its, introduction, intersex, people, face, stigmatization, and, discrimination, from, birth, or, following, the, discovery, of, intersex, traits, at, stages, of, development, such, as, puberty, intersex, people, may, face, infanticide, abandonment, and, stigmatization, from, their, families, globally, some, intersex, infants, and, children, such, as, those, with, ambiguous, outer, genitalia, are, surgically, or, hormonally, altered, to, create, more, socially, acceptable, sex, characteristics, this, is, considered, controversial, with, no, firm, evidence, of, favorable, outcomes, such, treatments, may, involve, sterilization, adults, including, elite, female, athletes, have, also, been, subjects, of, such, treatment, increasingly, these, issues, are, considered, human, rights, abuses, with, statements, from, international, and, national, human, rights, and, ethics, institutions, intersex, organizations, have, also, issued, statements, about, human, rights, violations, including, the, 2013, malta, declaration, of, the, third, international, intersex, forum, in, 2011, christiane, v, lling, became, the, first, intersex, person, known, to, have, successfully, sued, for, damages, in, a, case, brought, for, non, consensual, surgical, intervention, in, april, 2015, malta, became, the, first, country, to, outlaw, non, consensual, medical, interventions, to, modify, sex, anatomy, including, that, of, intersex, people, there, is, no, clear, consensus, definition, of, intersex, and, no, clear, delineation, of, which, specific, conditions, qualify, an, individual, as, intersex, the, world, health, organization, s, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, and, many, medical, journals, classify, intersex, traits, or, conditions, among, disorders, of, sex, development, dsd, a, common, adjective, for, people, with, disorders, of, sex, development, dsd, is, intersex, in, 1917, richard, goldschmidt, created, the, term, intersexuality, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, physical, sex, ambiguities, however, according, to, the, sage, encyclopedia, of, lgbtq, studies, it, was, not, until, anne, fausto, sterling, published, her, article, the, five, sexes, why, male, and, female, are, not, enough, in, 1993, that, the, term, reached, popularity, according, to, the, un, office, of, the, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, intersex, people, are, born, with, sex, characteristics, including, genitals, gonads, and, chromosome, patterns, that, do, not, fit, typical, binary, notions, of, male, or, female, bodies, intersex, is, an, umbrella, term, used, to, describe, a, wide, range, of, natural, bodily, variations, some, intersex, organizations, reference, intersex, people, and, intersex, variations, or, traits, while, others, use, more, medicalized, language, such, as, people, with, intersex, conditions, or, people, with, intersex, conditions, or, dsds, differences, of, sex, development, and, children, born, with, variations, of, sex, anatomy, in, may, 2016, interact, published, a, statement, recognizing, increasing, general, understanding, and, acceptance, of, the, term, intersex, australian, sociological, research, on, 272, people, born, with, atypical, sex, characteristics, published, in, 2016, found, that, 60, of, respondents, used, the, term, intersex, to, self, describe, their, sex, characteristics, including, people, identifying, themselves, as, intersex, describing, themselves, as, having, an, intersex, variation, or, in, smaller, numbers, having, an, intersex, condition, respondents, also, commonly, used, diagnostic, labels, and, referred, to, their, sex, chromosomes, with, word, choices, depending, on, audience, research, on, 202, respondents, by, the, lurie, children, s, hospital, chicago, and, the, ais, dsd, support, group, now, known, as, interconnect, support, group, published, in, 2017, found, that, 80, of, support, group, respondents, strongly, liked, liked, or, felt, neutral, about, intersex, as, a, term, while, caregivers, were, less, supportive, the, hospital, reported, that, the, use, of, the, term, disorders, of, sex, development, may, negatively, affect, care, another, study, by, a, group, of, children, s, hospitals, in, the, united, states, found, that, 53, of, 133, parent, and, adolescent, participants, recruited, at, five, clinics, did, not, like, the, term, intersex, participants, who, were, members, of, support, groups, were, more, likely, to, dislike, the, term, a, dsd, life, study, in, 2020, found, that, around, 43, of, 179, participants, thought, the, term, intersex, was, bad, 20, felt, neutral, about, the, term, while, 37, thought, the, term, was, good, historically, the, term, hermaphrodite, was, used, in, law, to, refer, to, people, whose, sex, was, in, doubt, the, 12th, century, decretum, gratiani, states, that, whether, an, hermaphrodite, may, witness, a, testament, depends, on, which, sex, prevails, hermafroditus, an, ad, testamentum, adhiberi, possit, qualitas, sexus, incalescentis, ostendit, similarly, the, 17th, century, english, jurist, and, judge, edward, coke, lord, coke, wrote, in, his, institutes, of, the, lawes, of, england, on, laws, of, succession, stating, every, heire, is, either, a, male, a, female, or, an, hermaphrodite, that, is, both, male, and, female, and, an, hermaphrodite, which, is, also, called, androgynus, shall, be, heire, either, as, male, or, female, according, to, that, type, of, sexe, which, doth, prevaile, during, the, victorian, era, medical, authors, attempted, to, ascertain, whether, or, not, humans, could, be, hermaphrodites, adopting, a, precise, biological, definition, for, the, term, and, making, distinctions, between, male, pseudohermaphrodite, female, pseudohermaphrodite, and, especially, true, hermaphrodite, these, terms, which, reflected, histology, microscopic, appearance, of, the, gonads, are, no, longer, used, until, the, mid, 20th, century, hermaphrodite, was, used, synonymously, with, intersex, medical, terminology, shifted, in, the, early, 21st, century, not, only, due, to, concerns, about, language, but, also, a, shift, to, understandings, based, on, genetics, the, term, hermaphrodite, is, also, controversial, as, it, implies, the, existence, of, someone, fully, male, and, fully, female, this, is, a, fantasy, by, certain, people, who, seek, hermaphrodite, sex, partners, in, the, intersex, movement, such, people, are, called, wannafucks, as, such, the, term, hermaphrodite, is, often, seen, as, degrading, and, offensive, although, many, intersex, activists, use, it, as, a, direct, form, of, self, empowerment, and, critique, such, as, in, the, isna, s, first, newsletter, hermaphrodites, with, attitude, the, intersex, society, of, north, america, has, stated, that, hermaphrodites, should, not, be, confused, with, intersex, people, and, that, using, hermaphrodite, to, refer, to, intersex, individuals, is, considered, to, be, stigmatizing, and, misleading, estimates, of, the, number, of, people, who, are, intersex, vary, depending, on, which, conditions, are, counted, as, intersex, the, now, defunct, intersex, society, of, north, america, stated, that, if, you, ask, experts, at, medical, centers, how, often, a, child, is, born, so, noticeably, atypical, in, terms, of, genitalia, that, a, specialist, in, sex, differentiation, is, called, in, the, number, comes, out, to, about, 1, in, 1, 500, to, 1, in, 2, 000, births, but, a, lot, more, people, than, that, are, born, with, subtler, forms, of, sex, anatomy, variations, some, of, which, won, t, show, up, until, later, in, life, anne, fausto, sterling, and, her, co, authors, stated, in, 2000, that, dding, the, estimates, of, all, known, causes, of, nondimorphic, sexual, development, suggests, that, approximately, 1, 7, of, all, live, births, do, not, conform, to, a, platonic, ideal, of, absolute, sex, chromosome, gonadal, genital, and, hormonal, dimorphism, these, publications, have, been, widely, quoted, by, intersex, activists, of, the, 1, 7, 1, 5, points, 88, of, those, considered, nondimorphic, sexual, development, in, this, figure, consist, of, individuals, with, late, onset, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, locah, which, may, be, asymptomatic, but, can, present, after, puberty, and, cause, infertility, leonard, sax, in, response, to, fausto, sterling, estimated, that, the, prevalence, of, intersex, was, about, 0, 018, of, the, world, s, population, discounting, several, conditions, included, in, fausto, sterling, s, estimate, that, included, locah, klinefelter, syndrome, 47, xxy, turner, syndrome, 45, x, the, chromosomal, variants, of, 47, xyy, and, 47, xxx, and, vaginal, agenesis, sax, reasons, that, in, these, conditions, chromosomal, sex, is, consistent, with, phenotypic, sex, and, phenotype, is, classifiable, as, either, male, or, female, in, a, 2003, letter, to, the, editor, political, scientist, carrie, hull, analyzed, the, data, used, by, fausto, sterling, and, said, the, estimated, intersex, rate, should, instead, have, been, 0, 37, due, to, many, errors, in, a, response, letter, published, simultaneously, fausto, sterling, welcomed, the, additional, analysis, and, said, i, am, not, invested, in, a, particular, final, estimate, only, that, there, be, an, estimate, a, 2018, review, reported, that, the, number, of, births, with, ambiguous, genitals, is, in, the, range, of, 0, 02, to, 0, 05, intersex, human, rights, australia, says, it, maintains, 1, 7, as, its, preferred, upper, limit, despite, its, flaws, stating, both, that, the, estimate, encapsulates, the, entire, population, of, people, who, are, stigmatized, or, risk, stigmatization, due, to, innate, sex, characteristics, and, that, sax, s, definitions, exclude, individuals, who, experience, such, stigma, and, who, have, helped, to, establish, the, intersex, movement, according, to, interact, a, major, organization, for, intersex, rights, in, the, us, states, that, 1, 7, of, people, have, some, variation, of, sexual, development, 0, 5, have, atypical, genitalia, and, 0, 05, have, mixed, ambiguous, genitalia, a, study, relying, on, a, nationally, representative, survey, conducted, in, mexico, between, 2021, and, 2022, obtained, similar, estimates, around, 1, 6, of, individuals, aged, 15, to, 64, reported, being, born, with, sex, variations, the, following, summarizes, prevalences, of, traits, that, medical, experts, consider, to, be, intersex, notes, from, early, history, societies, have, been, aware, of, intersex, people, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, is, found, in, mythology, the, greek, historian, diodorus, siculus, wrote, of, the, mythological, hermaphroditus, in, the, first, century, bc, who, was, born, with, a, physical, body, which, is, a, combination, of, that, of, a, man, and, that, of, a, woman, and, reputedly, possessed, supernatural, properties, he, also, recounted, the, lives, of, diophantus, of, abae, and, callon, of, epidaurus, ardhanarishvara, an, androgynous, composite, form, of, male, deity, shiva, and, female, deity, parvati, originated, in, kushan, culture, as, far, back, as, the, first, century, ad, a, statue, depicting, ardhanarishvara, is, included, in, india, s, meenakshi, temple, this, statue, clearly, shows, both, male, and, female, bodily, elements, hippocrates, c, 460, c, 370, bc, greek, physician, and, galen, 129, c, 200, 216, ad, roman, physician, surgeon, and, philosopher, both, viewed, sex, as, a, spectrum, between, men, and, women, with, many, shades, in, between, including, hermaphrodites, a, perfect, balance, of, male, and, female, pliny, the, elder, ad, 23, 24, 79, a, roman, naturalist, described, those, who, are, born, of, both, sexes, whom, we, call, hermaphrodites, at, one, time, androgyni, from, the, greek, andr, man, and, gyn, woman, augustine, 354, 430, ad, the, influential, catholic, theologian, wrote, in, the, literal, meaning, of, genesis, that, humans, were, created, in, two, sexes, despite, as, happens, in, some, births, in, the, case, of, what, we, call, androgynes, in, medieval, and, early, modern, european, societies, roman, law, post, classical, canon, law, and, later, common, law, referred, to, a, person, s, sex, as, male, female, or, hermaphrodite, with, legal, rights, as, male, or, female, depending, on, the, characteristics, that, appeared, most, dominant, the, 12th, century, decretum, gratiani, states, whether, an, hermaphrodite, may, witness, a, testament, depends, on, which, sex, prevails, the, foundation, of, common, law, the, 17th, century, institutes, of, the, lawes, of, england, described, how, a, hermaphrodite, could, inherit, either, as, male, or, female, according, to, that, kind, of, sexe, which, doth, prevaile, legal, cases, have, been, described, in, canon, law, and, elsewhere, over, the, centuries, some, non, european, societies, have, sex, or, gender, systems, that, recognize, more, than, the, two, categories, of, male, man, and, female, woman, some, of, these, cultures, for, instance, the, south, asian, hijra, communities, may, include, intersex, people, in, a, third, gender, category, although, according, to, morgan, holmes, early, western, anthropologists, categorized, such, cultures, as, primitive, holmes, has, argued, that, analyses, of, these, cultures, have, been, simplistic, or, romanticized, and, fail, to, take, account, of, the, ways, that, subjects, of, all, categories, are, treated, during, the, victorian, era, medical, authors, introduced, the, terms, true, hermaphrodite, for, an, individual, who, has, both, ovarian, and, testicular, tissue, male, pseudo, hermaphrodite, for, a, person, with, testicular, tissue, but, either, female, or, ambiguous, sexual, anatomy, and, female, pseudo, hermaphrodite, for, a, person, with, ovarian, tissue, but, either, male, or, ambiguous, sexual, anatomy, some, later, shifts, in, terminology, have, reflected, advances, in, genetics, while, other, shifts, are, suggested, to, be, due, to, pejorative, associations, the, term, intersexuality, was, coined, by, richard, goldschmidt, in, 1917, the, first, suggestion, to, replace, the, term, hermaphrodite, with, intersex, was, made, by, cawadias, in, the, 1940s, since, the, rise, of, modern, medical, science, some, intersex, people, with, ambiguous, external, genitalia, have, had, their, genitalia, surgically, modified, to, resemble, either, female, or, male, genitals, surgeons, pinpointed, intersex, babies, as, a, social, emergency, when, born, an, optimal, gender, policy, initially, developed, by, john, money, stated, that, early, intervention, helped, avoid, gender, identity, confusion, but, this, lacks, evidence, early, interventions, have, adverse, consequences, for, psychological, and, physical, health, since, advances, in, surgery, have, made, it, possible, for, intersex, conditions, to, be, concealed, many, people, are, not, aware, of, how, frequently, intersex, conditions, arise, in, human, beings, or, that, they, occur, at, all, dialogue, between, what, were, once, antagonistic, groups, of, activists, and, clinicians, has, led, to, only, slight, changes, in, medical, policies, and, how, intersex, patients, and, their, families, are, treated, in, some, locations, in, 2011, christiane, v, lling, became, the, first, intersex, person, known, to, have, successfully, sued, for, damages, in, a, case, brought, for, non, consensual, surgical, intervention, in, april, 2015, malta, became, the, first, country, to, outlaw, non, consensual, medical, interventions, to, modify, sex, anatomy, including, that, of, intersex, people, many, civil, society, organizations, and, human, rights, institutions, now, call, for, an, end, to, unnecessary, normalizing, interventions, including, in, the, malta, declaration, human, rights, institutions, are, placing, increasing, scrutiny, on, harmful, practices, and, issues, of, discrimination, against, intersex, people, these, issues, have, been, addressed, by, a, rapidly, increasing, number, of, international, institutions, including, in, 2015, the, council, of, europe, the, united, nations, office, of, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, and, the, world, health, organization, who, in, 2024, the, united, nations, human, rights, council, adopted, its, first, resolution, to, protect, the, rights, of, intersex, people, these, developments, have, been, accompanied, by, international, intersex, forums, and, increased, cooperation, among, civil, society, organizations, however, the, implementation, codification, and, enforcement, of, intersex, human, rights, in, national, legal, systems, remains, slow, stigmatization, and, discrimination, from, birth, may, include, infanticide, abandonment, and, the, stigmatization, of, families, the, birth, of, an, intersex, child, was, often, viewed, as, a, curse, or, a, sign, of, a, witch, mother, especially, in, parts, of, africa, abandonments, and, infanticides, have, been, reported, in, uganda, kenya, south, asia, and, china, infants, children, and, adolescents, also, experience, normalising, interventions, on, intersex, persons, that, are, medically, unnecessary, and, the, pathologisation, of, variations, in, sex, characteristics, in, countries, where, the, human, rights, of, intersex, people, have, been, studied, medical, interventions, to, modify, the, sex, characteristics, of, intersex, people, have, still, taken, place, without, the, consent, of, the, intersex, person, interventions, have, been, described, by, human, rights, defenders, as, a, violation, of, many, rights, including, but, not, limited, to, bodily, integrity, non, discrimination, privacy, and, experimentation, these, interventions, have, frequently, been, performed, with, the, consent, of, the, intersex, person, s, parents, when, the, person, is, legally, too, young, to, consent, such, interventions, have, been, criticized, by, the, who, other, un, bodies, such, as, the, office, of, the, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, and, an, increasing, number, of, regional, and, national, institutions, due, to, their, adverse, consequences, including, trauma, impact, on, sexual, function, and, sensation, and, violation, of, rights, to, physical, and, mental, integrity, the, un, organizations, decided, that, infant, intervention, should, not, be, allowed, in, favor, of, waiting, for, the, child, to, mature, enough, to, be, a, part, of, the, decision, making, this, allows, for, a, decision, to, be, made, with, total, consent, in, april, 2015, malta, became, the, first, country, to, outlaw, surgical, intervention, without, consent, in, the, same, year, the, council, of, europe, became, the, first, institution, to, state, that, intersex, people, have, the, right, not, to, undergo, sex, affirmation, interventions, people, born, with, intersex, bodies, are, seen, as, different, intersex, infants, children, adolescents, and, adults, are, often, stigmatized, and, subjected, to, multiple, human, rights, violations, including, discrimination, in, education, healthcare, employment, sport, and, public, services, researchers, have, documented, significant, disparities, in, mental, physical, and, sexual, health, when, comparing, intersex, individuals, to, the, general, population, including, higher, rates, of, bullying, stigmatization, harassment, violence, and, suicidal, intention, as, well, as, substantial, barriers, in, the, workplace, several, countries, have, so, far, explicitly, protected, intersex, people, from, discrimination, with, landmarks, including, south, africa, australia, and, most, comprehensively, malta, claims, for, compensation, and, remedies, for, human, rights, abuses, include, the, 2011, case, of, christiane, v, lling, in, germany, a, second, case, was, adjudicated, in, chile, in, 2012, involving, a, child, and, his, parents, a, further, successful, case, in, germany, taken, by, michaela, raab, was, reported, in, 2015, in, the, united, states, the, minor, child, m, c, v, aaronson, lawsuit, was, a, medical, malpractice, case, related, to, the, informed, consent, for, a, surgery, performed, on, the, crawford, s, adopted, child, known, as, m, c, at, in, april, 2006, the, case, was, one, of, the, first, lawsuit, of, its, type, to, challenge, legal, ethical, and, medical, issues, regarding, genital, normalizing, surgery, in, minors, and, was, eventually, settled, out, of, court, by, the, medical, university, of, south, carolina, for, 440, 000, in, 2017, access, to, information, medical, records, peer, and, other, counselling, and, support, with, the, rise, of, modern, medical, science, in, western, societies, a, secrecy, based, model, was, also, adopted, in, the, belief, that, this, was, necessary, to, ensure, normal, physical, and, psychosocial, development, the, asia, pacific, forum, of, national, human, rights, institutions, states, that, legal, recognition, is, firstly, about, intersex, people, who, have, been, issued, a, male, or, a, female, birth, certificate, being, able, to, enjoy, the, same, legal, rights, as, other, men, and, women, in, some, regions, obtaining, any, form, of, birth, certification, may, be, an, issue, a, kenyan, court, case, in, 2014, established, the, right, of, an, intersex, boy, baby, a, to, a, birth, certificate, like, all, individuals, some, intersex, individuals, may, be, raised, as, a, certain, sex, male, or, female, but, then, identify, with, another, later, in, life, while, most, do, not, recognition, of, third, sex, or, gender, classifications, occurs, in, several, countries, however, it, is, controversial, when, it, becomes, assumed, or, coercive, as, is, the, case, with, some, german, infants, sociological, research, in, australia, a, country, with, a, third, x, sex, classification, shows, that, 19, of, people, born, with, atypical, sex, characteristics, selected, an, x, or, other, option, while, 75, of, survey, respondents, self, described, as, male, or, female, 52, as, women, 23, as, men, and, 6, as, unsure, intersex, conditions, can, be, contrasted, with, transgender, gender, identities, and, the, attached, gender, dysphoria, a, transgender, person, may, feel, wherein, their, gender, identity, does, not, match, their, assigned, sex, however, some, people, are, both, intersex, and, transgender, although, intersex, people, by, definition, have, variable, sex, characteristics, that, do, not, align, with, either, typically, male, or, female, this, may, be, considered, separate, to, an, individual, s, assigned, gender, the, way, they, are, raised, and, perceived, and, their, internal, gender, identity, a, 2012, clinical, review, paper, found, that, between, 8, 5, and, 20, of, people, with, intersex, variations, experienced, gender, dysphoria, in, an, analysis, of, the, use, of, preimplantation, genetic, diagnosis, to, eliminate, intersex, traits, behrmann, and, ravitsky, state, parental, choice, against, intersex, may, conceal,

often, added, to, the, lgbt, acronym, resulting, in, the, acronym, lgbti, or, when, also, including, asexual, people, lgbtqia, emi, koyama, describes, how, inclusion, of, intersex, in, lgbti, can, fail, to, address, intersex, specific, human, rights, issues, including, creating, false, impressions, that, intersex, people, s, rights, are, protected, by, laws, protecting, lgbt, people, and, failing, to, acknowledge, that, many, intersex, people, are, not, lgbt, organisation, intersex, international, australia, states, that, some, intersex, individuals, are, homosexual, and, some, are, heterosexual, but, lgbti, activism, has, fought, for, the, rights, of, people, who, fall, outside, of, expected, binary, sex, and, gender, norms, julius, kaggwa, of, sipd, uganda, has, written, that, while, the, gay, community, offers, us, a, place, of, relative, safety, it, is, also, oblivious, to, our, specific, needs, mauro, cabral, has, written, that, transgender, people, and, organizations, need, to, stop, approaching, intersex, issues, as, if, they, were, trans, issues, including, use, of, intersex, conditions, and, people, as, a, means, of, explaining, being, transgender, we, can, collaborate, a, lot, with, the, intersex, movement, by, making, it, clear, how, wrong, that, approach, is, an, intersex, character, is, the, narrator, in, jeffrey, eugenides, pulitzer, prize, winning,

rights, australia, to, create, a, flag, that, is, not, derivative, but, is, yet, firmly, grounded, in, meaning, the, circle, is, described, as, unbroken, and, unornamented, symbolising, wholeness, and, completeness, and, our, potentialities, we, are, still, fighting, for, bodily, autonomy, and, genital, integrity, and, this, symbolises, the, right, to, be, who, and, how, we, want, to, be, the, intersex, flag, has, been, remixed, and, adapted, in, numerous, ways, one, way, has, been, to, replace, the, middle, ring, with, the, symbol, of, another, group, to, indicate, the, intersection, of, these, groups, for, example, the, autistic, intersex, flag, replaces, the, ring, with, an, infinity, symbol, to, represent, autism, another, technique, is, to, inset, another, flag, inside, the, ring, e, g, the, pride, flag, for, transgender, intersex, people, puts, the, transgender, flag, in, the, centre, in, 2021, valentino, vecchietti, of, intersex, equality, rights, uk, redesigned, the, progress, pride, flag, to, incorporate, the, intersex, flag, this, design, added, a, yellow, triangle, with, a, purple, circle, in, it, to, the, chevron, of, the, progress, pride, flag, it, also, changed, the, color, of, green, to, a, lighter, shade, without, adding, new, symbolism, intersex, equality, rights, uk, posted, the, new, flag, on, instagram, and, twitter, in, judaism, the, talmud, contains, extensive, discussion, concerning, the, status, of, two, types, of, intersex, people, in, jewish, law, namely, the, androgynous, who, exhibit, both, male, and, female, external, sexual, organs, and, the, tumtum, who, exhibit, neither, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, treatment, of, intersex, babies, started, to, be, discussed, in, orthodox, jewish, medical, halacha, by, prominent, rabbinic, leaders, such, as, eliezer, waldenberg, and, moshe, feinstein, erik, schinegger, foekje, dillema, maria, jos, mart, nez, pati, o, and, santhi, soundarajan, were, subject, to, adverse, sex,

posthumously, ruled, ineligible, to, have, competed, the, south, african, middle, distance, runner, caster, semenya, won, 3, world, championships, gold, medals, and, 2, olympic, gold, medals, in, the, women, s, 800, metres, when, semenya, won, gold, at, the, 2009, world, championships, the, international, association, of, athletics, federations, iaaf, requested, sex, verification, tests, on, the, very, same, day, the, results, were, not, released, and, semenya, was, ruled, eligible, to, compete, in, 2019, new, iaaf, rules, came, into, force, for, athletes, like, semenya, with, certain, disorders, of, sex, development, dsds, requiring, medication, to, suppress, testosterone, levels, in, order, to, participate, in, 400m, 800m, and, 1500m, women, s, events, semenya, objected, to, undergoing, the, treatment, which, is, now, mandatory, she, has, filed, a, series, of, legal, cases, to, restore, her, ability, to, compete, in, these, events, without, testosterone, suppression, arguing, that, the, world, athletics, rules, are, discriminatory, katrina, karkazis, rebecca, jordan, young, georgiann, davis, and, silvia, camporesi, have, claimed, that, iaaf, policies, on, hyperandrogenism, in, female, athletes, are, significantly, flawed, arguing, that, the, policy, does, not, protect, against, breaches, of, privacy, requires, athletes, to, undergo, unnecessary, treatment, in, order, to, compete, and, intensifies, gender, policing, and, recommended, that, athletes, be, able, to, compete, in, accordance, with, their, legally, recognised, gender, in, april, 2014, the, bmj, reported, that, four, elite, women, athletes, with, xy, chromosomes, and, 5, reductase, 2, deficiency, were, subjected, to, sterilization, and, partial, clitoridectomies, in, order, to, compete, in, sport, the, authors, noted, that, partial, clitoridectomy, was, not, medically, indicated, and, does, not, relate, to, real, or, perceived, athletic, advantage, intersex, advocates, regarded, this, intervention, as, a, clearly, coercive, process, in, 2016, the, united, nations, special, rapporteur, on, health, dainius, p, ras, criticized, current, and, historic, sex, verification, policies, describing, how, a, number, of, athletes, have, undergone, gonadectomy, removal, of, reproductive, organs, and, partial, clitoridectomy, a, form, of, female, genital, mutilation, in, the, absence, of, symptoms, or, health, issues, warranting, those, procedures, the, notion, of, intersex, individuals, can, be, understood, in, the, context, of, sexual, system, biology, that, varies, across, different, types, of, organisms, most, animal, species, 95, including, humans, are, gonochoric, in, which, individuals, are, of, either, a, female, or, male, sex, hermaphroditic, species, some, animals, and, most, flowering, plants, are, represented, by, individuals, that, can, express, both, sexes, simultaneously, or, sequentially, during, their, lifetimes, intersex, individuals, in, a, number, of, gonochoric, species, who, express, both, female, and, male, phenotypic, characters, to, some, degree, are, known, to, exist, at, very, low, prevalences, although, hermaphrodite, and, intersex, have, been, used, synonymously, in, humans, a, hermaphrodite, is, specifically, an, individual, capable, of, producing, female, and, male, gametes, while, there, are, reports, of, individuals, that, seemed, to, have, the, potential, to, produce, both, types, of, gamete, in, more, recent, years, the, term, hermaphrodite, as, applied, to, humans, has, fallen, out, of, favor, since, female, and, male, reproductive, functions, have, not, been, observed, together, in, the, same, individual, research, in, the, late, 20th, century, led, to, a, growing, medical, consensus, that, diverse, intersex, bodies, are, normal, but, relatively, rare, forms, of, human, biology, clinician, and, researcher, milton, diamond, stresses, the, importance, of, care, in, the, selection, of, language, related, to, intersex, people, foremost, we, advocate, use, of, the, terms, typical, usual, or, most, frequent, where, it, is, more, common, to, use, the, term, normal, when, possible, avoid, expressions, such, as, maldeveloped, or, undeveloped, errors, of, development, defective, genitals, abnormal, or, mistakes, of, nature, emphasize, that, all, of, these, conditions, are, biologically, understandable, while, they, are, statistically, uncommon, the, common, pathway, of, sexual, differentiation, where, a, productive, human, female, has, an, xx, chromosome, pair, and, a, productive, male, has, an, xy, pair, is, relevant, to, the, development, of, intersex, conditions, during, fertilization, the, sperm, adds, either, an, x, female, or, a, y, male, chromosome, to, the, x, in, the, ovum, this, determines, the, genetic, sex, of, the, embryo, during, the, first, weeks, of, development, genetic, male, and, female, fetuses, are, anatomically, indistinguishable, with, primitive, gonads, beginning, to, develop, during, approximately, the, sixth, week, of, gestation, the, gonads, in, a, bipotential, state, may, develop, into, either, testes, the, male, gonads, or, ovaries, the, female, gonads, depending, on, the, consequent, events, up, until, and, including, the, seventh, week, genetically, female, and, genetically, male, fetuses, appear, identical, at, around, eight, weeks, of, gestation, the, gonads, of, an, xy, embryo, differentiate, into, functional, testes, secreting, testosterone, ovarian, differentiation, for, xx, embryos, does, not, occur, until, approximately, week, 12, of, gestation, in, typical, female, differentiation, the, m, llerian, duct, system, develops, into, the, uterus, fallopian, tubes, and,

system, which, develops, into, the, vas, deferens, seminal, vesicles, and, ejaculatory, ducts, by, birth, the, typical, fetus, has, been, completely, sexed, male, or, female, meaning, that, the, genetic, sex, xy, male, or, xx, female, corresponds, with, the, phenotypical, sex, that, is, to, say, genetic, sex, corresponds, with, internal, and, external, gonads, and, external, appearance, of, the, genitals, there, are, a, variety, of, symptoms, that, can, occur, ambiguous, genitalia, is, the, most, common, sign, there, can, be, micropenis, clitoromegaly, partial, labial, fusion, electrolyte, abnormalities, delayed, or, absent, puberty, unexpected, changes, at, puberty, hypospadias, labial, or, inguinal, groin, masses, which, may, turn, out, to, be, testes, in, girls, and, undescended, testes, which, may, turn, out, to, be, ovaries, in, boys, ambiguous, genitalia, may, appear, as, a, large, clitoris, or, as, a, small, penis, because, there, is, variation, in, all, of, the, processes, of, the, development, of, the, sex, organs, a, child, can, be, born, with, a, sexual, anatomy, that, is, typically, female, or, feminine, in, appearance, with, a, larger, than, average, clitoris, clitoral, hypertrophy, or, typically, male, or, masculine, in, appearance, with, a, smaller, than, average, penis, that, is, open, along, the, underside, the, appearance, may, be, quite, ambiguous, describable, as, female, genitals, a, vulva, with, a, very, large, clitoris, and, partially, fused, labia, or, as, male, genitals, with, a, very, small, penis, completely, open, along, the, midline, hypospadic, and, empty, scrotum, fertility, is, variable, the, orchidometer, is, a, medical, instrument, to, measure, the, volume, of, the, testicles, it, was, developed, by, swiss, pediatric, endocrinologist, andrea, prader, the, prader, scale, and, quigley, scale, are, visual, rating, systems, that, measure, genital, appearance, these, measurement, systems, were, satirized, in, the, phall, o, meter, created, by, the, now, defunct, intersex, society, of, north, america, in, order, to, help, in, classification, methods, other, than, a, genitalia, inspection, can, be, performed, for, instance, a, karyotype, display, of, a, tissue, sample, may, determine, which, of, the, causes, of, intersex, is, prevalent, in, the, case, additionally, electrolyte, tests, endoscopic, exam, ultrasound, and, hormone, stimulation, tests, can, be, done, intersex, can, be, divided, into, four, categories, which, are, 46, xx, intersex, 46, xy, intersex, true, gonadal, intersex, and, complex, or, undetermined, intersex, this, condition, used, to, be, called, female, pseudohermaphroditism, persons, with, this, condition, have, female, internal, genitalia, and, karyotype, xx, and, various, degree, of, external, genitalia, virilization, external, genitalia, is, masculinized, congenitally, when, female, fetus, is, exposed, to, excess, androgenic, environment, hence, the, chromosome, of, the, person, is, of, a, female, the, ovaries, of, a, female, but, external, genitals, that, appear, like, a, male, the, labia, fuse, and, the, clitoris, enlarges, to, appear, like, a, penis, the, causes, of, this, can, be, male, hormones, taken, during, pregnancy, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, male, hormone, producing, tumors, in, the, mother, and, aromatase, deficiency, this, condition, used, to, be, called, male, pseudohermaphroditism, this, is, defined, as, incomplete, masculinization, of, the, external, genitalia, thus, the, person, has, male, chromosomes, but, the, external, genitals, are, incompletely, formed, ambiguous, or, clearly, female, this, condition, is, also, called, 46, xy, with, undervirilization, 46, xy, intersex, has, many, possible, causes, which, can, be, problems, with, the, testes, and, testosterone, formation, also, there, can, be, problems, with, using, testosterone, some, people, lack, the, enzyme, needed, to, convert, testosterone, to, dihydrotestosterone, which, is, a, cause, of, 5, alpha, reductase, deficiency, androgen, insensitivity, syndrome, is, the, most, common, cause, of, 46, xy, intersex, this, condition, used, to, be, called, true, hermaphroditism, this, is, defined, as, having, asymmetrical, gonads, with, ovarian, and, testicular, differentiation, on, either, sides, separately, or, combined, as, ovotestis, in, most, cases, the, cause, of, this, condition, is, unknown, this, is, the, condition, of, having, any, chromosome, configurations, rather, than, 46, xx, or, 46, xy, intersex, this, condition, does, not, result, in, an, imbalance, between, internal, and, external, genitalia, however, there, may, be, problems, with, sex, hormone, levels, overall, sexual, development, and, altered, numbers, of, sex, chromosomes, there, are, a, variety, of, opinions, on, what, conditions, or, traits, are, and, are, not, intersex, dependent, on, the, definition, of, intersex, that, is, used, current, human, rights, based, definitions, stress, a, broad, diversity, of, sex, characteristics, that, differ, from, expectations, for, male, or, female, bodies, during, 2015, the, council, of, europe, the, european, union, agency, for, fundamental, rights, and, inter, american, commission, on, human, rights, have, called, for, a, review, of, medical, classifications, on, the, basis, that, they, presently, impede, enjoyment, of, the, right, to, health, the, council, of, europe, expressed, concern, that, the, gap, between, the, expectations, of, human, rights, organisations, of, intersex, people, and, the, development, of, medical, classifications, has, possibly, widened, over, the, past, decade, medical, interventions, take, place, to, address, physical, health, concerns, and, psychosocial, risks, both, types, of, rationale, are, the, subject, of, debate, particularly, as, the, consequences, of, surgical, and, many, hormonal, interventions, are, lifelong, and, irreversible, questions, regarding, physical, health, include, accurately, assessing, risk, levels, necessity, and, timing, psychosocial, rationales, are, particularly, susceptible, to, questions, of, necessity, as, they, reflect, social, and, cultural, concerns, there, remains, no, clinical, consensus, about, an, evidence, base, surgical, timing, necessity, type, of, surgical, intervention, and, degree, of, difference, warranting, intervention, such, surgeries, are, the, subject, of, significant, contention, due, to, consequences, that, include, trauma, impact, on, sexual, function, and, sensation, and, violation, of, rights, to, physical, and, mental, integrity, this, includes, community, activism, and, multiple, reports, by, international, human, rights, and, health, institutions, and, national, ethics, bodies, in, the, cases, where, gonads, may, pose, a, cancer, risk, as, in, some, cases, of, androgen, insensitivity, syndrome, concern, has, been, expressed, that, treatment, rationales, and, decision, making, regarding, cancer, risk, may, encapsulate, decisions, around, a, desire, for, surgical, normalization, the, term, hermaphrodite, has, sometimes, been, used, to, refer, to, humans, whose, biological, sex, is, ambiguous, this, usage, has, fallen, out, of, favor, and, in, any, case, was, technically, incorrect, the, essential, characteristic, of, hermaphrodites, is, the, ability, to, reproduce, as, both, male, and, female, no, such, case, has, been, identified, in, any, human
