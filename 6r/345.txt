for, their, spectators, before, mascots, were, fictional, icons, or, people, in, suits, animals, were, mostly, used, in, order, to, bring, a, somewhat, different, feel, to, the, game, and, to, strike, fear, upon, the, rivalry, teams, as, time, went, on, mascots, evolved, from, predatory, animals, to, two, dimensional, fantasy, mascots, to, finally, what, we, know, today, three, dimensional, mascots, stylistic, changes, in, american, puppetry, in, the, mid, 20th, century, including, the, work, of, jim, henson, and, sid, and, marty, krofft, soon, were, adapted, to, sports, mascots, it, allowed, people, to, not, only, have, visual, enjoyment, but, also, interact, physically, with, the, mascots, marketers, quickly, realized, the, great, potential, in, three, dimensional, mascots, and, took, on, board, the, costumed, puppet, idea, this, change, encouraged, other, companies, to, start, creating, their, own, mascots, resulting, in, mascots, being, a, necessity, amongst, not, only, the, sporting, industry, but, for, other, organisations, the, word, mascot, originates, from, the, french, term, mascotte, which, means, lucky, charm, this, was, used, to, describe, anything, that, brought, luck, to, a, household, the, word, was, first, recorded, in, 1867, and, popularised, by, a, french, composer, edmond, audran, who, wrote, the, opera, la, mascotte, performed, in, december,

before, this, the, terms, were, familiar, to, the, people, of, france, as, a, slang, word, used, by, gamblers, the, term, is, a, derivative, of, the, word, masco, meaning, sorceress, or, witch, before, the, 19th, century, the, word, mascot, was, associated, with, inanimate, objects, that, would, be, commonly, seen, such, as, a, lock, of, hair, or, a, figurehead, on, a, sailing, ship, from, then, to, the, twentieth, century, the, term, has, been, used, in, reference, to, any, good, luck, animals, objects, etc, and, more, recently, including, human, caricatures, and, fictional, creatures, created, as, logos, for, sports, teams, often, the, choice, of, the, mascot, reflects, the, desired, quality, a, typical, example, of, this, is, the, fighting, spirit, in, which, a, competitive, nature, is, personified, by, warriors, or, predatory, animals, mascots, may, also, symbolize, a, local, or, regional, trait, such, as, the, nebraska, cornhuskers, mascot, herbie, husker, a, stylized,
