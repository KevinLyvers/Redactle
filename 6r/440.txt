carom, billiards, also, called, french, billiards, and, sometimes, carambole, billiards, is, the, overarching, title, of, a, family, of, cue, sports, generally, played, on, cloth, covered, pocketless, billiard, tables, in, its, simplest, form, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, score, points, or, counts, by, caroming, one, s, own, cue, ball, off, both, the, opponent, s, cue, ball, and, the, object, ball, on, a, single, shot, the, invention, as, well, as, the, exact, date, of, origin, of, carom, billiards, is, somewhat, obscure, but, is, thought, to, be, traceable, to, 18th, century, france, there, is, a, large, array, of, carom, billiards, disciplines, some, of, the, more, prevalent, today, and, historically, are, chronologically, by, apparent, date, of, development, straight, rail, one, cushion, balkline, three, cushion, and, artistic, billiards, carom, billiards, is, popular, in, europe, particularly, france, where, it, originated, it, is, also, popular, in, asian, countries, including, japan, the, philippines, south, korea, and, vietnam, but, is, now, considered, obscure, in, north, america, having, been, supplanted, by, pool, in, popularity, the, union, mondiale, de, billard, umb, is, the, highest, international, governing, body, of, competitive, carom, billiards, the, word, carom, which, simply, means, any, strike, and, rebound, was, in, use, in, reference, to, billiards, by, at, least, 1779, sometimes, spelled, carrom, 41, sources, differ, on, the, origin, it, has, been, pegged, variously, as, a, shortening, of, the, spanish, and, portuguese, word, carambola, or, the, french, word, carambole, which, are, used, to, describe, the, red, object, ball, some, etymologists, have, suggested, that, carambola, in, turn, was, derived, from, a, yellow, to, orange, tropical, asian, fruit, also, known, in, portuguese, as, a, carambola, which, was, a, corruption, of, the, original, name, of, the, fruit, karambal, in, the, marathi, language, of, india, also, known, as, star, fruit, but, this, may, simply, be, folk, etymology, as, the, fruit, bears, no, resemblance, to, a, billiard, ball, and, there, is, no, direct, evidence, for, such, a, derivation, in, modern, french, the, word, carambolage, means, successive, collision, currently, used, mainly, in, reference, to, carom, or, cannon, shots, in, billiards, and, to, multiple, vehicle, car, crashes, the, billiard, table, used, for, carom, billiards, is, a, pocketless, version, and, is, typically, 3, 0, by, 1, 5, metres, 10, ft, 5, ft, most, cloth, made, for, carom, billiard, tables, is, a, type, of, baize, that, is, typically, dyed, green, and, is, made, from, 100, worsted, wool, with, no, nap, which, provides, a, very, fast, surface, allowing, the, balls, to, travel, with, little, resistance, across, the, table, bed, the, slate, bed, of, a, carom, billiard, table, is, often, heated, to, about, 5, c, 9, f, above, room, temperature, which, helps, to, keep, moisture, out, of, the, cloth, to, aid, the, balls, rolling, and, rebounding, in, a, consistent, manner, and, generally, makes, a, table, play, faster, an, electrically, heated, table, is, required, under, international, tournament, rules, in, order, to, ensure, the, best, possible, rolling, although, temperatures, are, not, specified, it, is, an, especially, important, requirement, for, the, games, of, three, cushion, billiards, and, artistic, billiards, and, even, local, billiard, halls, often, have, this, feature, in, countries, where, carom, games, are, popular, queen, victoria, 1819, 1901, had, a, billiard, table, that, was, heated, using, zinc, tubes, although, the, aim, at, that, time, was, chiefly, to, keep, the, then, used, ivory, balls, from, warping, the, first, use, of, electric, heating, was, for, an, 18, 2, balkline, tournament, held, in, december, 1927, between, welker, cochran, and, jacob, schaefer, jr, the, new, york, times, announced, it, with, fanfare, for, the, first, time, in, the, history, of, world, s, championship, balkline, billiards, a, heated, table, will, be, used, in, most, carom, billiards, games, the, set, of, three, standard, balls, includes, a, white, cue, ball, a, second, cue, ball, in, yellow, and, a, third, object, ball, in, red, historically, the, second, cue, ball, was, white, with, red, or, black, spots, to, differentiate, it, both, types, of, ball, sets, are, permitted, in, tournament, play, the, balls, are, significantly, larger, and, heavier, than, their, pool, or, snooker, counterparts, with, a, diameter, of, 61, to, 61, 5, millimetres, 2, 40, to, 2, 42, in, and, a, weight, ranging, between, 205, and, 220, grams, 7, 2, and, 7, 8, oz, with, a, typical, weight, of, 210, g, 7, 5, oz, billiard, balls, have, been, made, from, many, different, materials, throughout, the, history, of, the, game, including, clay, wood, ivory, plastics, including, early, formulations, of, celluloid, bakelite, and, crystalate, and, more, modern, phenolic, resin, polyester, and, acrylic, and, even, steel, the, dominant, material, from, 1627, until, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, was, ivory, the, quest, for, an, alternative, to, ivory, was, primarily, driven, by, economic, considerations, and, concerns, for, the, safety, of, elephant, hunters, rather, than, environmental, or, animal, welfare, issues, the, impetus, for, this, search, was, in, part, the, announcement, by, new, york, billiard, table, manufacturer, brunswick, balke, collender, offering, a, 10, 000, prize, for, the, development, of, a, substitute, material, the, initial, successful, alternative, came, in, the, form, of, celluloid, invented, by, john, wesley, hyatt, in, 1868, however, while, celluloid, was, a, viable, substitute, it, proved, to, be, volatile, and, highly, flammable, with, instances, of, explosions, occurring, during, its, manufacturing, process, carom, billiard, cues, have, specialized, refinements, making, them, different, from, cues, used, in, other, cue, sports, carom, cues, tend, to, be, shorter, and, lighter, overall, with, a, shorter, ferrule, a, thicker, butt, and, joint, a, wooden, joint, pin, in, high, end, examples, and, collarless, wood, to, wood, joint, they, have, a, sharply, conical, taper, and, a, smaller, tip, diameter, as, compared, with, pool, cues, typical, carom, cues, are, 140, 140, cm, 54, 56, in, in, length, and, 470, 520, g, 16, 5, 18, 5, oz, in, weight, lighter, for, straight, rail, heavier, for, three, cushion, with, a, tip, 11, 12, mm, 0, 43, 0, 47, in, in, diameter, these, dimensions, make, the, cue, significantly, stiffer, which, aids, in, handling, the, larger, and, heavier, balls, used, in, carom, billiards, it, also, acts, to, reduce, deflection, sometimes, called, squirt, which, is, displacement, of, the, cue, ball, s, path, away, from, the, parallel, line, formed, by, the, cue, stick, s, direction, of, travel, it, is, a, factor, that, occurs, every, time, english, is, employed, and, its, effects, are, magnified, by, speed, in, some, carom, games, deflection, plays, a, large, role, because, many, shots, require, extremes, of, side, spin, coupled, with, great, speed, this, is, a, combination, typically, minimized, as, much, as, possible, by, contrast, in, pool, 79, 240, 1, straight, rail, is, thought, to, date, to, the, 18th, century, although, no, exact, time, of, origin, is, known, the, object, of, straight, rail, is, simple, one, point, called, a, count, is, scored, each, time, a, player, s, cue, ball, makes, contact, with, both, object, balls, the, second, cue, ball, and, the, third, ball, on, a, single, stroke, a, win, is, achieved, by, reaching, an, agreed, upon, number, of, counts, at, straight, rail, s, inception, there, was, no, restriction, on, the, manner, of, scoring, however, the, technique, of, crotching, or, freezing, two, balls, into, the, corner, where, the, rails, meet, the, crotch, vastly, increasing, counts, resulted, in, an, 1862, rule, which, allowed, only, three, counts, before, at, least, one, ball, had, to, be, driven, away, techniques, continued, to, develop, which, increased, counts, greatly, despite, the, crotching, prohibition, especially, the, development, of, a, variety, of, nurse, techniques, the, most, important, of, these, the, rail, nurse, involves, the, progressive, nudging, of, the, object, balls, down, a, rail, ideally, moving, them, only, a, small, amount, on, each, count, keeping, them, close, together, and, positioned, at, the, end, of, each, stroke, in, the, same, or, near, the, same, configuration, such, that, the, nurse, can, be, replicated, again, and, again, straight, rail, is, still, popular, in, europe, where, it, is, considered, a, fine, practice, game, for, both, balkline, and, three, cushion, billiards, additionally, europe, hosts, professional, competitions, known, as, pentathlons, in, which, straight, rail, is, featured, as, one, of, five, billiards, disciplines, at, which, players, compete, the, other, four, being, 47, 1, balkline, cushion, caroms, 71, 2, balkline, and, three, cushion, billiards, straight, rail, was, played, professionally, in, the, united, states, from, 1873, to, 1879, but, is, uncommon, there, today, in, 1879, a, variant, called, the, champion, s, game, or, limited, rail, was, introduced, with, the, specific, intent, of, frustrating, the, rail, nurse, the, game, employed, diagonal, lines, at, the, table, s, corners, to, regions, where, counts, were, restricted, ultimately, however, despite, its, divergence, from, straight, rail, the, champion, s, game, simply, expanded, the, dimensions, of, the, balk, space, defined, under, the, existing, crotch, prohibition, which, was, not, sufficient, to, stop, nursing, balkline, succeeded, the, champion, s, game, adding, more, rules, to, curb, nursing, techniques, in, the, balkline, games, the, entire, table, is, divided, into, rectangular, balk, spaces, by, drawing, pairs, of, balklines, lengthwise, and, widthwise, across, the, table, parallel, from, each, rail, this, divides, the, table, into, nine, rectangular, balkspaces, such, balk, spaces, define, areas, of, the, table, surface, in, which, a, player, may, only, score, up, to, a, threshold, number, of, points, while, the, object, balls, are, within, that, region, additionally, rectangles, are, drawn, where, each, balkline, meets, a, rail, called, anchor, spaces, which, developed, to, stop, a, number, of, nursing, techniques, that, exploited, the, fact, that, if, the, object, balls, straddled, a, balkline, no, count, limit, was, in, place, for, the, most, part, the, differences, between, one, balkline, game, to, another, is, defined, by, two, measures, the, spacing, of, the, balklines, and, the, number, of, points, that, are, allowed, in, each, balk, space, before, at, least, one, ball, must, leave, the, region, generally, balkline, games, and, their, particular, restrictions, are, given, numerical, names, indicating, both, of, these, characteristics, the, first, number, indicated, either, inches, or, centimeters, depending, on, the, game, and, the, second, after, a, dot, or, a, slash, indicates, the, count, restriction, in, balk, spaces, which, is, always, either, one, or, two, for, example, in, 18, 2, balkline, one, of, the, more, prominent, balkline, games, and, of, us, origin, the, name, indicates, that, balklines, are, drawn, 18, inches, distant, from, each, rail, and, only, two, counts, are, allowed, in, a, balk, space, before, a, ball, must, leave, by, contrast, in, 71, 2, balkline, of, french, invention, lines, are, drawn, 71, centimeters, distant, from, each, rail, also, with, a, two, count, restriction, for, balk, spaces, in, its, various, incarnations, balkline, was, the, predominant, carom, discipline, from, 1883, to, the, 1930s, when, it, was, overtaken, by, three, cushion, billiards, and, pool, balkline, is, still, popular, in, europe, and, the, far, east, one, cushion, carom, or, simply, cushion, carom, also, arose, in, the, late, 1860s, as, another, alternative, to, the, repetitive, play, of, straight, rail, inspired, by, an, early, variant, of, english, billiards, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, score, cushion, caroms, meaning, a, carom, off, of, both, object, balls, with, at, least, one, rail, cushion, being, struck, before, the, hit, on, the, second, object, ball, one, cushion, carom, is, still, popular, in, europe, in, three, cushion, carom, the, object, is, to, carom, off, both, object, balls, with, at, least, three, rail, cushions, being, contacted, before, the, contact, of, the, cue, ball, with, the, second, object, ball, three, cushion, is, a, very, difficult, game, averaging, one, point, per, inning, is, professional, level, play, and, averaging, 1, 5, to, 2, is, world, class, play, wayman, c, mccreery, of, st, louis, missouri, is, credited, with, popularizing, the, game, in, the, 1870s, at, least, one, publication, categorically, states, he, invented, the, game, as, well, the, first, three, cushion, billiards, tournament, took, place, 14, 31, january, 1878, in, st, louis, with, mccreery, a, participant, and, leon, magnus, the, winner, the, high, run, for, the, tournament, was, just, 6, points, and, the, high, average, a, 0, 75, the, game, was, infrequently, played, with, many, top, carom, players, of, the, era, voicing, their, dislike, of, it, until, the, 1907, introduction, of, the, lambert, trophy, by, 1924, three, cushion, had, become, so, popular, that, two, giants, in, other, billiard, disciplines, agreed, to, take, up, the, game, especially, for, a, challenge, match, on, 22, september, 1924, willie, hoppe, the, world, s, balkline, champion, who, later, took, up, three, cushion, with, a, passion, and, ralph, greenleaf, the, world, s, straight, pool, title, holder, played, a, well, advertised, multi, day, match, to, 600, points, hoppe, was, the, eventual, winner, with, a, final, score, in, of, 600, 527, three, cushion, billiards, retains, great, popularity, in, parts, of, europe, asia, and, latin, america, and, is, the, most, popular, carom, billiards, game, played, in, the, us, today, umb, as, the, governing, body, of, the, sport, had, been, staging, world, three, cushion, championships, since, the, late, 1920s, in, artistic, billiards, players, compete, at, performing, 76, preset, shots, of, varying, difficulty, each, set, shot, has, a, maximum, point, value, assigned, for, perfect, execution, ranging, from, a, 4, point, minimum, for, lowest, level, difficulty, shots, and, climbing, to, an, 11, point, maximum, for, shots, deemed, highest, in, difficulty, level, there, is, a, total, of, 500, points, available, to, a, player, each, shot, in, an, artistic, billiards, match, is, played, from, a, well, defined, position, in, some, venues, within, an, exacting, two, millimeter, tolerance, and, each, shot, must, unfold, in, an, established, manner, players, are, allowed, three, attempts, at, each, shot, in, general, the, shots, making, up, the, game, even, 4, point, shots, require, a, high, degree, of, skill, devoted, practice, and, specialized, knowledge, to, perform, world, title, competition, first, started, in, 1986, and, required, the, use, of, ivory, balls, however, this, requirement, was, dropped, in, 1990, the, highest, score, ever, achieved, in, competition, overall, is, 427, set, by, walter, bax, on, 12, march, 2006, at, a, competition, held, in, deurne, belgium, beating, his, own, previous, record, of, 425, the, game, is, played, predominantly, in, western, europe, especially, in, france, belgium, and, the, netherlands
