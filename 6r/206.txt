chippendale, shaver, and, wormley, brothers, cabinet, constructors, and, george, hepplewhite, also, published, books, of, furniture, forms, these, books, were, compendiums, of, their, designs, and, those, of, other, cabinet, makers, the, most, famous, cabinetmaker, before, the, advent, of, industrial, design, is, probably, andr, charles, boulle, 11, november, 1642, 29, february, 1732, and, his, legacy, is, known, as, boulle, work, and, the, cole, boulle, a, college, of, fine, arts, and, crafts, and, applied, arts, in, paris, today, bears, testimony, to, his, art, with, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, application, of, steam, power, to, cabinet, making, tools, mass, production, techniques, were, gradually, applied, to, nearly, all, aspects, of, cabinet, making, and, the, traditional, cabinet, shop, ceased, to, be, the, main, source, of, furniture, domestic, or, commercial, in, parallel, to, this, evolution, there, came, a, growing, demand, by, the, rising, middle, class, in, most, industrialised, countries, for, finely, made, furniture, this, eventually, grew, the, total, number, of, traditional, cabinet, makers, before, 1650, fine, furniture, was, a, rarity, in, western, europe, and, north, america, generally, people, did, not, need, it, and, for, the, most, part, could, not, afford, it, they, made, do, with, simple, but, serviceable, pieces, the, arts, and, craft, movement, which, started, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, spurred, a, market, for, traditional, cabinet, making, and, other, craft, goods, it, rapidly, spread, to, the, united, states, and, to, all, the, countries, in, the, british, empire, this, movement, exemplified, the, reaction, to, the, eclectic, historicism, of, the, victorian, era, and, to, the, soulless, machine, made, production, which, was, starting, to, become, widespread, during, this, time, cabinetry, was, said, to, be, one, of, the, most, noble, and, admirable, skills, by, nearly, one, fourth, of, the, population, of, the, united, kingdom, and, 31, of, those, who, believed, this, strived, for, their, children, to, learn, the, art, of, cabinetry, after, world, war, ii, woodworking, became, a, popular, hobby, among, the, middle, classes, the, more, serious, and, skilled, amateurs, in, this, field, now, turn, out, pieces, of, furniture, which, rival, the, work, of, professional, cabinet, makers, together, their, work, now, represents, but, a, small, percentage, of, furniture, production, in, any, industrial, country, but, their, numbers, are, vastly, greater, than, those, of, their, counterparts, in, the, 18th, century, and, before, glamour, style, was, originally, a, combination, of, english, greek, revival, french, regency, and, hollywood, glamour, the,

and, vertical, lines, compared, to, other, designs, there, is, a, distinct, absence, of, ornamentation, while, scandinavian, design, is, easy, to, identify, it, is, much, more, about, the, materials, than, the, design, this, style, of, design, is, ornate, french, provincial, objects, are, often, stained, or, painted, leaving, the, wood, concealed, corners, and, bevels, are, often, decorated, with,

materials, used, but, in, as, much, as, possible, how, they, existed, in, their, natural, state, for, example, a, table, top, may, have, what, is, considered, a, live, edge, that, allows, you, to,

base, i, e, a, plinth, a, scrolled, based, bracket, feet, or, it, could, be, a, set, of, legs, a, type, of, adjustable, leg, has, been, adopted, from, the, european, cabinet, system, which, offers,

is, either, screwed, onto, the, back, side, of, the, kick, board, or, a, barbed, plastic, clip, is, inserted, into, a, saw, kerf, also, made, on, the, back, side, of, the, kick, board, this, toe, kick, board, can, be, made, to, fit, each, base, cabinet, or, made, to, fit, a, run, of, cabinets, kitchen, cabinets, or, any, cabinet, generally, at, which, a, person, may, stand, usually, have, a, fully, enclosed, base, in, which, the, front, edge, has, been, set, back, 75, mm, or, so, to, provide, room, for, toes, known, as, the, kick, space, a, scrolled, base, is, similar, to, the, fully, enclosed, base, but, it, has, areas, of, the, base, material, removed, often, with, a, decorative, pattern, leaving, feet, on, which, the, cabinet, stands, bracket, feet, are, separate, feet, usually, attached, in, each, corner, and, occasionally, for, larger, pieces, in, the, middle, of, the, cabinet, a, cabinet, usually, has, at, least, one, compartment, compartments, may, be, open, as, in, open,

obvious, modern, cabinets, employ, many, more, complicated, means, relative, to, a, simple, shelf, of, making, browsing, lower, cabinets, more, efficient, and, comfortable, one, example, is, the, lazy, susan, a, shelf, which, rotates, around, a, central, axis, allowing, items, stored, at, the, back, of, the, cabinet, to, be, brought, to, the, front, by, rotating, the, shelf, these, are, usually, used, in, corner, cabinets, which, are, larger, and, deeper, and, have, a, greater, dead, space, at, the, back, than, other, cabinets, an, alternative, to, the, lazy, susan, particularly, in, base, cabinets, is, the, blind, corner, cabinet, pull, out, unit, these, pull, out, and, turn, making, the, attached, shelving, unit, slide, into, the, open, area, of, the, cabinet, door, thus, making, the, shelves, accessible, to, the, user, these, units, make, usable, what, was, once, dead, space, other, insert, hardware, includes, such, items, as, mixer, shelves, that, pull, out, of, a, base, cabinet, and, spring, into, a, locked, position, at, counter, height, this, hardware, aids, in, lifting, these, somewhat, heavy, mixers, and, assists, with, positioning, the, unit, for, use, more, and, more, components, are, being, designed, to, enable, specialized, hardware, to, be, used, in, standard, cabinet, carcasses, most, cabinets, incorporate, a, top, of, some, sort, in, many, cases, the, top, is, merely, to, enclose, the, compartments, within, and, serves, no, other, purpose, as, in, a, wall, hung, cupboard, for, example, in, other, cabinets, the, top, also, serves, as, a, work, surface, a, kitchen, countertop, for, example
