kwans, instead, wanted, a, unified, style, to, be, created, based, on, inputs, from, all, the, kwans, to, serve, as, a, way, to, bring, on, the, heritage, and, characteristics, of, all, of, the, styles, not, just, the, style, of, a, single, kwan, as, a, response, to, this, along, with, political, disagreements, about, teaching, taekwondo, in, north, korea, and, unifying, the, whole, korean,

by, choi, modern, itf, organizations, have, continued, to, update, and, expand, upon, this, philosophy, the, world, taekwondo, federation, wtf, also, refers, to, the, commandments, of, the, hwarang, in, the, articulation, of, its, taekwondo, philosophy, like, the, itf, philosophy, it, centers, on, the, development, of, a, peaceful, society, as, one, of, the, overarching, goals, for, the, practice, of, taekwondo, the, wt, s, stated, philosophy, is, that, this, goal, can, be, furthered, by, adoption, of, the, hwarang, spirit, by, behaving, rationally, education, in, accordance, with,

the, emphasis, on, speed, and, agility, is, a, defining, characteristic, of, taekwondo, and, has, its, origins, in, analyses, undertaken, by, choi, hong, hi, the, results, of, that, analysis, are, known, by, itf, practitioners, as, choi, s, theory, of, power, choi, based, his, understanding, of, power, on, biomechanics, and, newtonian, physics, as, well, as, chinese, martial, arts, for, example, choi, observed, that, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, strike, increases, quadratically, with, the, speed, of, the, strike, but, increases, only, linearly, with, the, mass, of, the, striking, object, in, other, words, speed, is, more, important, than, size, in, terms, of, generating, power, this, principle, was, incorporated, into, the, early, design, of, taekwondo, and, is, still, used, choi, also, advocated, a, relax, strike, principle, for, taekwondo, in, other, words, between, blocks, kicks, and, strikes, the, practitioner, should, relax, the, body, then, tense, the, muscles, only, while, performing, the, technique, it, is, believed, that, the, relax, strike, principle, increases, the, power, of, the, technique, by, conserving, the, body, s, energy, he, expanded, on, this, principle, with, his, advocacy, of, the, sine, wave, technique, this, involves, raising, one, s, centre, of, gravity, between, techniques, then, lowering, it, as, the, technique, is, performed, producing, the, up, and, down, movement, from, which, the, term, sine, wave, is, derived, the, components, of, the, theory, of, power, include, taekwondo, competitions, typically, involve, sparring, breaking, and, patterns, some, tournaments, also, include, special, events, such, as, demonstration, teams, and, self, defense, hosinsul, in, olympic, taekwondo, competitions, however, only, sparring, using, wt, competition, rules, is, performed, there, are, two, kinds, of, competition, sparring, point, sparring, in, which, all, strikes, are, light, contact, and, the, clock, is, stopped, when, a, point, is, scored, and, olympic, sparring, where, all, strikes, are, full, contact, and, the, clock, continues, when, points, are, scored, under, world, taekwondo, wt, formerly, wtf, and, olympic, rules, sparring, is, a, full, contact, event, employing, a, continuous, scoring, system, where, the, fighters, are, allowed, to, continue, after, scoring, each, technique, taking, place, between, two,

championships, that, are, condensed, to, four, for, the, olympics, a, win, can, occur, by, points, or, if, one, competitor, is, unable, to, continue, knockout, however, there, are, several, decisions, that, can, lead, to, a, win, as, well, including, superiority, withdrawal, disqualification, or, even, a, referee, s, punitive, declaration, each, match, consists, of, three, two, minute, rounds,

technical, spinning, techniques, and, score, punches, points, are, awarded, for, permitted, techniques, delivered, to, the, legal, scoring, areas, as, determined, by, an, electronic, scoring, system, which, assesses, the, strength, and, location, of, the, contact, the, only, techniques, allowed, are, kicks, delivering, a, strike, using, an, area, of, the, foot, below, the, ankle, punches, delivering, a, strike, using, the, closed, fist, and, pushes, in, some, smaller, tournaments, and, in, the, past, points, were, awarded, by, three, corner, judges, using, electronic, scoring, tallies, all, major, national, and, international, tournaments, have, moved, fully, as, of, 2017, to, electronic, scoring, including, the, use, of, electronic, headgear, this, limits, corner, judges, to,

if, there, is, no, score, in, the, additional, round, the, winner, is, decided, by, superiority, as, determined, by, the, refereeing, officials, or, number, of, fouls, committed, during, that, round, if, a, competitor, has, a, 20, point, lead, at, the, end, of, the, second, round, or, achieves, a, 20, point, lead, at, any, point, in, the, third, round, then, the, match, is, over, and, that,
