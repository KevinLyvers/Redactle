matches, within, a, fleet, of, sailing, craft, between, a, pair, thereof, or, among, teams, additionally, there, are, specialized, competitions, that, include, setting, speed, records, racing, formats, include, both, closed, courses, and, point, to, point, contests, they, may, be, in, sheltered, waters, coast, wise, or, on, the, open, ocean, most, competitions, are, held, within, defined, classes, or, ratings, that, either, entail, one, type, of, sailing, craft, to, ensure, a, contest, primarily, of, skill, or, rating, the, sailing, craft, to, create, classifications, or, handicaps, on, the, water, a, sailing, competition, among, multiple, vessels, is, called, a, regatta, a, regatta, consists, of, multiple, individual, races, the, boat, crew, that, performs, best, in, over, the, series, of, races, is, the, overall, winner, there, is, a, broad, variety, of, kinds, of, races, and, sailboats, used, for, racing, from, large, yacht, to, dinghy, racing, much, racing, is, done, around, buoys, or, similar, marks, in, protected, waters, while, some, longer, offshore, races, cross, open, water, various, kinds, of, boats, are, used, for, racing, including, small, dinghies, catamarans, boats, designed, primarily, for, cruising, and, purpose, built, raceboats, the, racing, rules, of, sailing, govern, the, conduct, of, yacht, racing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, model, boat, racing, dinghy, racing, and, virtually, any, other, form, of, racing, around, a, course, with, more, than, one, vessel, while, powered, by, the, wind, the, barcolana, regatta, of, the, italian, yacht, club, societ, velica, di, barcola, e, grignano, is, currently, the, guinness, world, record, holder, as, the, largest, sailing, race, with, 2, 689, boats, and, over, 16, 000, sailors, at, the, starting, line, the, international, olympic, committee, recognizes, world, sailing, ws, as, the, world, governing, body, for, the, sport, of, sailing, yacht, racing, it, was, formed, in, 1904, as, the, international, yacht, racing, union, and, then, called, the, international, sailing, federation, until, rebranding, 2014, many, town, yacht, clubs, maintain, their, own, racing, teams, for, both, juniors, and, adults, often, several, yacht, clubs, will, get, together, to, hold, events, that, can, include, more, than, 100, entered, boats, per, race, making, up, the, regatta, although, often, both, adults, and, juniors, sail, the, same, classes, of, boat, fleet, races, can, have, anywhere, from, four, boats, to, hundreds, of, boats, in, a, race, a, regatta, must, have, at, least, three, races, to, be, counted, each, boat, s, place, in, each, race, is, added, to, compile, a, final, score, the, lowest, scorer, wins, in, match, racing, only, two, boats, compete, against, each, other, the, best, known, competition, of, this, type, is, the, america, s, cup, the, tactics, involved, in, match, racing, are, different, from, those, of, other, races, because, the, objective, is, merely, to, arrive, at, the, finish, line, before, the, opponent, which, is, not, necessarily, as, fast, as, possible, the, tactics, involved, at, the, start, are, also, special, team, racing, is, most, often, between, two, teams, of, three, boats, each, it, involves, similar, technique, to, match, racing, but, has, the, added, dimension, that, it, is, the, overall, scoring, of, the, race, that, matters, in, three, on, three, team, racing, this, means, that, the, team, that, scores, ten, or, less, points, wins, for, this, reason, many, tactics, are, used, to, advance, teammates, to, make, stable, combinations, for, winning, the, stable, combinations, most, commonly, sought, are, play, one, which, is, 1, 2, anything, play, two, or, 2, 3, 4, and, play, 4, a, 1, 4, 5, combination, these, are, generally, regarded, as, the, best, setups, to, win, and, the, hardest, for, the, opposing, team, to, play, offense, against, is, managed, by, world, speed, sailing, record, council, is, common, to, board, sports, both, windsurfing, and, kiteboarding, are, experimenting, with, new, formats, harbor, or, buoy, races, are, conducted, in, protected, waters, and, are, quite, short, usually, taking, anywhere, from, a, few, minutes, to, a, few, hours, all, sorts, of, sailing, craft, are, used, for, these, races, including, keel, boats, of, all, sizes, as, well, as, dinghies, trailer, sailors, catamarans, skiffs, sailboards, and, other, small, craft, this, kind, of, race, is, most, commonly, run, over, one, or, more, laps, of, a, triangular, course, marked, by, a, number, of, buoys, the, course, starts, from, an, imaginary, line, drawn, from, a, committee, boat, to, the, designated, starting, buoy, or, pin, a, number, of, warning, signals, are, given, telling, the, crews, exactly, how, long, until, the, race, starts, the, aim, of, each, crew, is, to, cross, the, start, line, at, full, speed, exactly, as, the, race, starts, a, course, generally, involves, tacking, upwind, to, a, windward, marker, or, buoy, then, bearing, away, onto, a, downwind, leg, to, a, second, jibe, marker, next, another, jibe, on, a, second, downwind, leg, to, the, last, mark, which, is, called, the, downwind, mark, or, leeward, mark, at, this, mark, the, boats, turn, into, wind, once, again, to, tack, to, the, finish, line, the, most, famous, and, longest, running, of, these, events, are, inshore, racing, is, yacht, racing, not, in, protected, waters, but, along, and, generally, within, sight, of, land, or, from, land, to, nearby, islands, as, distinct, from, offshore, racing, across, open, water, and, oceans, the, duration, of, races, may, be, daylight, only, overnight, or, passage, races, of, several, days, some, races, such, as, the, swiftsure, yacht, race, are, actually, a, group, of, inshore, races, of, various, distances, along, overlapping, courses, to, allow, for, different, classes, and, skills, depending, on, location, stability, and, safety, equipment, requirements, will, be, more, extensive, than, for, harbor, racing, but, less, so, than, for, offshore, racing, different, levels, of, requirement, for, navigation, sleeping, cooking, and, water, storage, also, apply, offshore, yacht, races, are, held, over, long, distances, and, in, open, water, such, races, usually, last, for, at, least, a, number, of, hours, the, longest, offshore, races, involve, a, circumnavigation, of, the, world, some, of, the, most, famous, offshore, races, are, as, follows, several, fully, crewed, round, the, world, races, are, held, including, south, african, yacht, clubs, organise, the, south, atlantic, race, the, former, cape, to, rio, race, the, governor, s, cup, from, cape, town, to, st, helena, island, and, a, race, between, durban, and, mauritius, single, handed, ocean, yacht, racing, began, with, the, race, across, the, atlantic, ocean, by, william, albert, andrews, and, josiah, w, lawlor, in, 1891, however, the, first, regular, single, handed, ocean, race, was, the, single, handed, trans, atlantic, race, first, held, in, 1960, the, first, round, the, world, yacht, race, was, the, sunday, times, golden, globe, race, of, 1968, 1969, which, was, also, a, single, handed, race, with, the, only, winner, robin, knox, johnston, on, suhaili, this, inspired, the, present, day, velux, 5, oceans, race, formerly, the, boc, challenge, around, alone, and, the, vend, e, globe, single, handed, racing, has, seen, a, great, boom, in, popularity, in, recent, years, there, is, some, controversy, about, the, legality, of, sailing, single, handed, over, long, distances, as, the, navigation, rules, require, that, every, vessel, shall, at, all, times, maintain, a, proper, lookout, single, handed, sailors, can, only, keep, a, sporadic, lookout, due, to, the, need, to, sleep, tend, to, navigation, etc, certain, races, do, not, fit, in, the, above, categories, one, such, is, the, three, peaks, yacht, race, in, the, uk, which, is, a, team, competition, involving, sailing, cycling, and, running, many, design, factors, have, a, large, impact, on, the, speed, at, which, a, boat, can, complete, a, course, including, the, size, of, a, boat, s, sails, its, length, and, the, weight, and, shape, of, its, hull, because, of, these, differences, it, can, be, difficult, to, compare, the, skills, of, the, sailors, in, a, race, if, they, are, sailing, very, different, boats, for, most, forms, of, yacht, racing, one, of, two, solutions, to, this, problem, are, used, either, all, boats, are, required, to, race, on, a, first, to, finish, basis, these, groups, of, boats, are, called, classes, or, a, handicapping, system, is, used, which, implements, correction, factors, each, class, has, a, detailed, set, of, specifications, that, must, be, met, for, the, boat, to, be, considered, a, member, of, that, class, some, classes, e, g, the, laser, have, very, tight, specifications, ensuring, that, there, is, virtually, no, difference, between, the, boats, except, for, age, these, classes, are, sometimes, called, strict, one, design, in, one, design, racing, all, boats, must, conform, to, the, same, standard, the, class, rules, thus, emphasizing, the, skill, of, the, skipper, and, crew, rather, than, having, the, results, depend, on, equipment, superiority, these, kind, of, classes, are, most, commonly, brand, linked, to, brands, with, laser, performance, rs, sailing, melges, and, j, boats, range, being, good, examples, popular, international, classes, include, the, optimist, 470, snipe, and, etchells, a, box, rule, specifies, a, maximum, overall, size, for, boats, in, the, class, as, well, as, features, such, as, stability, competitors, in, these, classes, are, then, free, to, enter, their, own, boat, designs, as, long, as, they, do, not, exceed, the, box, rule, no, handicap, is, then, applied, a, construction, class, is, based, on, a, formula, or, set, of, restrictions, which, the, boat, s, measurements, must, fit, to, be, accepted, to, the, class, resulting, boats, are, all, unique, yet, ideally, relatively, close, in, size, and, performance, perhaps, the, most, popular, and, enduring, construction, formula, is, the, metre, rule, around, which, several, still, popular, classes, were, designed, with, the, 12, metre, being, the, most, famous, due, to, its, involvement, in, the, america, s, cup, when, all, the, yachts, in, a, race, are, not, members, of, the, same, class, then, a, handicap, is, used, to, adjust, the, times, of, boats, the, handicap, attempts, to, specify, a, normal, speed, for, each, boat, usually, based, either, on, measurements, taken, of, the, boat, or, on, the, past, record, of, that, kind, of, boat, each, boat, is, timed, over, the, specified, course, after, it, has, finished, the, handicap, is, used, to, adjust, each, boat, s, finishing, time, the, results, are, based, on, this, sum, popular, handicapping, systems, include, earlier, popular, rating, systems, include, ior, and, ims, the, majority, of, sailing, events, are, open, events, in, which, males, and, females, compete, together, on, equal, terms, either, as, individuals, or, part, of, team, sailing, has, had, female, only, world, championships, since, the, 1970s, to, encourage, participation, and, now, hosts, more, than, 30, such, world, championship, titles, each, year, for, the, 2016, olympics, in, rio, compulsory, mixed, gender, in, the, event, were, added, for, the, first, time, in, addition, the, following, criteria, are, sometimes, applied, to, events
