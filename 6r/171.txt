connected, to, slavery, the, vikings, took, both, free, women, and, slaves, as, concubines, researchers, have, suggested, that, vikings, may, have, originally, started, sailing, and, raiding, due, to, a, need, to, seek, out, women, from, foreign, lands, there, are, theories, that, polygynous, relationships, in, viking, society, could, have, led, to, a, shortage, of, eligible, women, for, the, average, male, polygyny, increases, male, male, competition, in, society, because, it, creates, a, pool, of, unmarried, men, willing, to, engage, in, risky, status, elevating, and, sex, seeking, behaviors, thus, the, average, viking, man, could, have, been, forced, to, perform, riskier, actions, to, gain, wealth, and, power, to, be, able, to, find, suitable, women, the, theory, and, concept, was, expressed, in, the, 11th, century, by, historian, dudo, of, saint, quentin, in, his, semi, imaginary, history, of, the, normans, the, annals, of, ulster, depicts, raptio, and, states, that, in, 821, the, vikings, plundered, an, irish, village, and, carried, off, a, great, number, of, women, into, captivity, people, taken, captive, during, the, viking, raids, in, western, europe, such, as, ireland, could, be, sold, to, moorish, spain, via, the, dublin, slave, trade, or, transported, to, hedeby, or, br, nn, and, from, there, via, the, volga, trade, route, to, present, day, russia, where, slaves, and, furs, were, sold, to, muslim, merchants, in, exchange, for, arab, silver, dirham, and, silk, which, have, been, found, in, birka, wollin, and, dublin, initially, this, trade, route, between, europe, and, the, abbasid, caliphate, passed, via, the, khazar, kaghanate, but, from, the, early, 10th, century, onward, it, went, via, volga, bulgaria, and, from, there, by, caravan, to, khwarazm, to, the, samanid, slave, market, in, central, asia, and, finally, via, iran, to, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, the, middle, east, were, there, was, a, great, market, for, slave, girls, as, concubines, the, christian, morals, developed, by, patristic, writers, largely, promoted, marriage, as, the, only, form, of, union, between, men, and, women, both, saint, augustine, and, saint, jerome, strongly, condemned, the, institution, of, concubinage, emperor, justinian, in, his, great, sixth, century, code, the, corpus, iurus, civilis, granted, to, concubines, and, their, children, the, sorts, of, property, and, inheritance, rights, usually, reserved, for, wives, he, brought, the, institution, of, concubinatus, closer, to, marriage, but, he, also, repeated, the, christian, injunction, that, concubinage, must, be, permanent, and, monogamous, the, two, views, christian, condemnation, and, secular, continuity, with, the, roman, legal, system, continued, to, be, in, conflict, throughout, the, entire, middle, ages, until, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, church, outlawed, concubinage, in, the, territories, under, its, control, in, the, historic, muslim, arab, world, concubine, surriyya, referred, to, the, female, slave, j, riya, whether, muslim, or, non, muslim, with, whom, her, master, engages, in, sexual, intercourse, in, addition, to, household, or, other, services, such, relationships, were, common, in, pre, islamic, arabia, and, other, pre, existing, cultures, of, the, wider, region, islam, introduced, legal, restrictions, and, discipline, to, the, concubinage, and, encouraged, manumission, islam, furthermore, endorsed, educating, instruction, in, islam, freeing, or, marrying, female, slaves, if, they, embrace, islam, abandoning, polytheism, or, infidelity, acknowledged, children, of, concubines, are, generally, declared, as, legitimate, with, or, without, wedlock, and, the, mother, of, a, free, child, was, considered, free, upon, the, death, of, her, male, enslaver, there, is, evidence, that, concubines, had, a, higher, rank, than, female, slaves, abu, hanifa, and, others, argued, for, modesty, like, practices, for, the, concubine, recommending, that, the, concubine, be, established, in, the, home, and, their, chastity, be, protected, and, not, to, misuse, them, for, sale, or, sharing, with, friends, or, kins, while, scholars, exhorted, masters, to, treat, their, slaves, equally, a, master, was, allowed, to, show, favoritism, towards, a, concubine, islamic, scholars, have, disagreed, on, the, exact, interpretation, verse, 23, 6, in, the, quran, is, believed, by, some, islamic, scholars, to, say, that, it, is, allowed, to, have, sexual, intercourse, with, concubines, after, marrying, them, as, islam, forbids, sexual, intercourse, outside, of, marriage, some, scholars, recommended, holding, a, wedding, banquet, walima, to, celebrate, the, concubinage, relationship, however, this, is, not, required, in, teachings, of, islam, and, is, rather, the, self, preferred, opinions, of, certain, non, liberal, islamic, scholars, even, the, arabic, term, for, concubine, surriyya, may, have, been, derived, from, sarat, meaning, eminence, indicating, the, concubine, s, higher, status, over, other, female, slaves, the, qur, an, does, not, use, the, word, surriyya, but, instead, uses, the, expression, ma, malakat, aymanukum, that, which, your, right, hands, own, which, occurs, 15, times, in, the, book, sayyid, abul, ala, maududi, explains, that, two, categories, of, women, have, been, excluded, from, the, general, command, of, guarding, the, private, parts, a, wives, b, women, who, are, legally, in, one, s, possession, some, contend, that, concubinage, was, a, pre, islamic, custom, that, was, allowed, to, be, practiced, under, islam, with, jews, and, non, muslim, people, to, marry, a, concubine, after, teaching, her, instructing, her, well, and, then, giving, her, freedom, in, the, traditions, of, the, abrahamic, religions, abraham, had, a, concubine, named, hagar, who, was, originally, a, slave, of, his, wife, sarah, the, story, of, hagar, would, affect, how, concubinage, was, perceived, in, early, islamic, history, sikainiga, writes, that, one, rationale, for, concubinage, in, islam, was, that, it, satisfied, the, sexual, desire, of, the, female, slaves, and, thereby, prevented, the, spread, of, immorality, in, the, muslim, community, most, islamic, schools, of, thought, restricted, concubinage, to, a, relationship, where, the, female, slave, was, required, to, be, monogamous, to, her, master, though, the, master, s, monogamy, to, her, is, not, required, but, according, to, sikainga, in, reality, this, was, not, always, practiced, and, female, slaves, were, targeted, by, other, men, of, the, master, s, household, these, opinions, of, sikaingia, are, controversial, and, contested, in, ancient, times, two, sources, for, concubines, were, permitted, under, an, islamic, regime, primarily, non, muslim, women, taken, as, prisoners, of, war, were, made, concubines, as, happened, after, the, battle, of, the, trench, or, in, numerous, later, caliphates, it, was, encouraged, to, manumit, slave, women, who, rejected, their, initial, faith, and, converted, to, islam, or, to, bring, them, into, formal, marriage, the, expansion, of, various, muslim, dynasties, resulted, in, acquisitions, of, concubines, through, purchase, from, the, slave, trade, gifts, from, other, rulers, and, captives, of, war, to, have, a, large, number, of, concubines, became, a, symbol, of, status, almost, all, abbasid, caliphs, were, born, to, concubines, the, custom, to, have, concubines, was, common, in, all, islamic, dynasties, until, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, 20th, century, similarly, the, sultans, of, the, ottoman, empire, were, often, the, son, of, a, concubine, as, a, result, some, individual, concubines, came, to, exercise, a, degree, of, influence, over, ottoman, politics, some, concubines, developed, social, networks, and, accumulated, personal, wealth, both, of, which, allowed, them, to, rise, on, social, status, the, practice, declined, with, the, abolition, of, slavery, starting, in, the, 19th, century, and, finally, abolished, in, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, 1960s, with, slavery, in, saudi, arabia, being, banned, in, 1962, and, slavery, in, oman, in, 1970, ottoman, sultans, appeared, to, have, preferred, concubinage, to, marriage, and, for, a, time, all, royal, children, were, born, of, concubines, the, consorts, of, ottoman, sultans, were, often, neither, turkish, nor, muslim, by, birth, leslie, peirce, argues, that, this, was, because, a, concubine, would, not, have, the, political, leverage, that, would, be, possessed, by, a, princess, or, a, daughter, of, the, local, elite, ottoman, sultans, also, appeared, to, have, only, one, son, with, each, concubine, that, is, once, a, concubine, gave, birth, to, a, son, the, sultan, would, no, longer, have, intercourse, with, her, this, limited, the, power, of, each, son, when, slavery, became, institutionalized, in, colonial, america, white, men, whether, or, not, they, were, married, sometimes, took, enslaved, women, as, concubines, children, of, such, unions, remained, slaves, in, the, various, european, colonies, in, the, caribbean, white, planters, took, black, and, mulatto, concubines, owing, to, the, shortage, of, white, women, the, children, of, such, unions, were, sometimes, freed, from, slavery, and, even, inherited, from, their, father, though, this, was, not, the, case, for, the, majority, of, children, born, of, such, unions, these, relationships, appeared, to, have, been, socially, accepted, in, the, colony, of, jamaica, and, even, attracted, european, emigrants, to, the, island, in, colonial, brazil, men, were, expected, to, marry, women, who, were, equal, to, them, in, status, and, wealth, alternatively, some, men, practiced, concubinage, an, extra, marital, sexual, relationship, this, sort, of, relationship, was, condemned, by, the, catholic, church, and, the, council, of, trent, threatened, those, who, engaged, in, it, with, excommunication, concubines, constituted, both, female, slaves, and, former, slaves, one, reason, for, taking, non, white, women, as, concubines, was, that, free, white, men, outnumbered, free, white, women, although, marriage, between, races, was, not, illegal, some, french, settlers, in, new, france, were, recorded, to, keep, native, women, as, concubines, sometimes, while, being, married, to, a, white, woman, this, was, particularly, common, in, louisiana, but, was, discouraged, by, the, clergy, relationships, with, slaves, in, the, united, states, and, the, confederacy, were, sometimes, euphemistically, referred, to, as, concubinary, from, lifelong, to, single, or, serial, sexual, visitations, these, relationships, with, enslaved, people, illustrate, a, radical, power, imbalance, between, a, human, owned, as, chattel, and, the, legal, owner, of, same, when, personal, ownership, of, slaves, was, enshrined, in, the, law, an, enslaved, person, had, no, legal, power, over, their, own, legal, personhood, the, legal, control, to, which, was, held, by, another, entity, therefore, a, slave, could, never, give, real, and, legal, consent, in, any, aspect, of, their, life, the, inability, to, give, any, kind, of, consent, when, enslaved, is, in, part, due, to, the, ability, of, a, slave, master, to, legally, coerce, acts, and, declarations, including, those, of, affection, attraction, and, consent, through, rewards, and, punishments, legally, however, the, concept, of, chattel, slavery, in, the, united, states, and, confederate, states, defined, and, enforced, in, the, law, owning, the, legal, personhood, of, a, slave, meaning, that, the, proxy, for, legal, consent, was, found, with, the, slave, s, master, who, was, the, sole, source, of, consent, in, the, law, to, the, bodily, integrity, and, all, efforts, of, that, slave, except, as, regulated, or, limited, by, law, with, slavery, being, recognized, as, a, crime, against, humanity, in, the, united, states, law, as, well, as, in, international, customary, law, the, legal, basis, of, slavery, is, repudiated, for, all, time, as, are, any, rights, which, owner, rapists, had, had, to, exercise, any, proxy, consent, sexual, or, otherwise, for, their, slaves, free, men, in, the, united, states, sometimes, took, female, slaves, in, relationships, which, they, referred, to, as, concubinage, although, marriage, between, the, races, was, prohibited, by, law, in, the, colonies, and, the, later, united, states, many, colonies, and, states, also, had, laws, against, miscegenation, or, any, interracial, relations, from, 1662, the, colony, of, virginia, followed, by, others, incorporated, into, law, the, principle, that, children, took, their, mother, s, status, i, e, the, principle, of, partus, sequitur, ventrem, this, led, to, generations, of, multiracial, slaves, some, of, whom, were, otherwise, considered, legally, white, one, eighth, or, less, african, equivalent, to, a, great, grandparent, before, the, american, civil, war, in, some, cases, men, had, long, term, relationships, with, enslaved, women, giving, them, and, their, mixed, race, children, freedom, and, providing, their, children, with, apprenticeships, education, and, transfer, of, capital, a, relationship, between, thomas, jefferson, and, sally, hemings, is, an, example, of, this, such, arrangements, were, more, prevalent, in, the, american, south, during, the, antebellum, period, in, louisiana, and, former, french, territories, a, formalized, system, of, concubinage, called, pla, age, developed, european, men, took, enslaved, or, free, women, of, color, as, mistresses, after, making, arrangements, to, give, them, a, dowry, house, or, other, transfer, of, property, and, sometimes, if, they, were, enslaved, offering, freedom, and, education, for, their, children, a, third, class, of, free, people, of, color, developed, especially, in, new, orleans, many, became, educated, artisans, and, property, owners, french, speaking, and, practicing, catholicism, these, women, combined, french, and, african, american, culture, and, created, an, elite, between, those, of, european, descent, and, the, slaves, today, descendants, of, the, free, people, of, color, are, generally, called, louisiana, creole, people, in, judaism, a, concubine, is, a, marital, companion, of, inferior, status, to, a, wife, among, the, israelites, men, commonly, acknowledged, their, concubines, and, such, women, enjoyed, the, same, rights, in, the, house, as, legitimate, wives, the, term, concubine, did, not, necessarily, refer, to, women, after, the, first, wife, a, man, could, have, many, wives, and, concubines, legally, any, children, born, to, a, concubine, were, considered, to, be, the, children, of, the, wife, she, was, under, the, concubine, may, not, have, commanded, the, exact, amount, of, respect, as, the, wife, in, the, levitical, rules, on, sexual, relations, the, hebrew, word, that, is, commonly, translated, as, wife, is, distinct, from, the, hebrew, word, that, means, concubine, however, on, at, least, one, other, occasion, the, term, is, used, to, refer, to, a, woman, who, is, not, a, wife, specifically, the, handmaiden, of, jacob, s, wife, in, the, levitical, code, sexual, intercourse, between, a, man, and, a, wife, of, a, different, man, was, forbidden, and, punishable, by, death, for, both, persons, involved, since, it, was, regarded, as, the, highest, blessing, to, have, many, children, wives, often, gave, their, maids, to, their, husbands, if, they, were, barren, as, in, the, case, of, rachel, and, bilhah, the, children, of, the, concubine, often, had, equal, rights, with, those, of, the, wife, for, example, king, abimelech, was, the, son, of, gideon, and, his, concubine, later, biblical, figures, such, as, gideon, and, solomon, had, concubines, in, addition, to, many, childbearing, wives, for, example, the, books, of, kings, say, that, solomon, had, 700, wives, and, 300, concubines, the, account, of, the, unnamed, levite, in, judges, 19, 20, shows, that, the, taking, of, concubines, was, not, the, exclusive, preserve, of, kings, or, patriarchs, in, israel, during, the, time, of, the, judges, and, that, the, rape, of, a, concubine, was, completely, unacceptable, to, the, israelite, nation, and, led, to, a, civil, war, in, the, story, the, levite, appears, to, be, an, ordinary, member, of, the, tribe, whose, concubine, was, a, woman, from, bethlehem, in, judah, this, woman, was, unfaithful, and, eventually, abandoned, him, to, return, to, her, paternal, household, however, after, four, months, the, levite, referred, to, as, her, husband, decided, to, travel, to, her, father, s, house, to, persuade, his, concubine, to, return, she, is, amenable, to, returning, with, him, and, the, father, in, law, is, very, welcoming, the, father, in, law, convinces, the, levite, to, remain, several, additional, days, until, the, party, leaves, behind, schedule, in, the, late, evening, the, group, pass, up, a, nearby, non, israelite, town, to, arrive, very, late, in, the, city, of, gibeah, which, is, in, the, land, of, the, benjaminites, the, group, sit, around, the, town, square, waiting, for, a, local, to, invite, them, in, for, the, evening, as, was, the, custom, for, travelers, a, local, old, man, invites, them, to, stay, in, his, home, offering, them, guest, right, by, washing, their, feet, and, offering, them, food, a, band, of, wicked, townsmen, attack, the, house, and, demand, the, host, send, out, the, levite, man, so, they, can, rape, him, the, host, offers, to, send, out, his, virgin, daughter, as, well, as, the, levite, s, concubine, for, them, to, rape, to, avoid, breaking, guest, right, towards, the, levite, eventually, to, ensure, his, own, safety, and, that, of, his, host, the, levite, gives, the, men, his, concubine, who, is, raped, and, abused, through, the, night, until, she, is, left, collapsed, against, the, front, door, at, dawn, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, levite, man, chose, to, save, himself, from, rape, at, the, expense, of, his, wife, in, the, morning, the, levite, finds, her, when, he, tries, to, leave, when, she, fails, to, respond, to, her, husband, s, order, to, get, up, possibly, because, she, is, dead, although, the, language, is, unclear, the, levite, places, her, on, his, donkey, and, continues, home, once, home, he, dismembers, her, body, and, distributes, the, 12, parts, throughout, the, nation, of, israel, the, israelites, gather, to, learn, why, they, were, sent, such, grisly, gifts, and, are, told, by, the, levite, of, the, sadistic, rape, of, his, concubine, the, crime, is, considered, outrageous, by, the, israelite, tribesmen, who, then, wreak, total, retribution, on, the, men, of, gibeah, as, well, as, the, surrounding, tribe, of, benjamin, when, they, support, the, gibeans, killing, them, without, mercy, and, burning, all, their, towns, the, inhabitants, of, the, town, of, jabesh, gilead, are, then, slaughtered, as, a, punishment, for, not, joining, the, 11, tribes, in, their, war, against, the, benjaminites, and, their, 400, unmarried, daughters, given, in, forced, marriage, to, the, 600, benjamite, survivors, finally, the, 200, benjaminite, survivors, who, still, have, no, wives, are, granted, a, mass, marriage, by, abduction, by, the, other, tribes, in, judaism, concubines, are, referred, to, by, the, hebrew, term, pilegesh, hebrew, the, term, is, a, loanword, from, ancient, greek, meaning, a, mistress, staying, in, house, according, to, the, babylonian, talmud, the, difference, between, a, concubine, and, a, legitimate, wife, was, that, the, latter, received, a, ketubah, and, her, marriage, nissu, in, was, preceded, by, an, erusin, formal, betrothal, which, was, not, the, case, for, a, concubine, one, opinion, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, argues, that, the, concubine, should, also, receive, a, marriage, contract, but, without, a, clause, specifying, a, divorce, settlement, according, to, rashi, wives, with, kiddushin, and, ketubbah, concubines, with, kiddushin, but, without, ketubbah, this, reading, is, from, the, jerusalem, talmud, certain, jewish, thinkers, such, as, maimonides, believed, that, concubines, were, strictly, reserved, for, royal, leadership, and, thus, that, a, commoner, may, not, have, a, concubine, indeed, such, thinkers, argued, that, commoners, may, not, engage, in, any, type, of, sexual, relations, outside, of, a, marriage, maimonides, was, not, the, first, jewish, thinker, to, criticise, concubinage, for, example, leviticus, rabbah, severely, condemns, the, custom, other, jewish, thinkers, such, as, nahmanides, samuel, ben, uri, shraga, phoebus, and, jacob, emden, strongly, objected, to, the, idea, that, concubines, should, be, forbidden, despite, these, prohibitions, concubinage, remained, widespread, among, jewish, households, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, resembled, the, practice, among, the, muslim, households, in, the, hebrew, of, the, contemporary, state, of, israel, pilegesh, is, often, used, as, the, equivalent, of, the, english, word, mistress, i, e, the, female, partner, in, extramarital, relations, regardless, of, legal, recognition, attempts, have, been, initiated, to, popularise, pilegesh, as, a, form, of, premarital, non, marital, or, extramarital, relationship, which, according, to, the, perspective, of, the, enacting, person, s, is, permitted, by, jewish, law, in, some, context, the, institution, of, concubinage, diverged, from, a, free, quasi, marital, cohabitation, to, the, extent, that, it, was, forbidden, to, a, free, woman, to, be, involved, in, a, concubinage, and, the, institution, was, reserved, only, to, slaves, this, type, of, concubinage, was, practiced, in, patriarchal, cultures, throughout, history, many, societies, automatically, freed, the, concubine, after, she, had, a, child, among, societies, that, did, not, legally, require, the, manumission, of, concubines, it, was, usually, done, anyway, in, slave, owning, societies, most, concubines, were, slaves, but, not, all, the, feature, of, concubinage, that, made, it, attractive, to, certain, men, was, that, the, concubine, was, dependent, on, the, man, she, could, be, sold, or, punished, at, the, master, s, will, according, to, orlando, peterson, slaves, taken, as, concubines, would, have, had, a, higher, level, of, material, comfort, than, the, slaves, used, in, agriculture, or, in, mining
