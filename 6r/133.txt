sugar, is, the, generic, name, for, sweet, tasting, soluble, carbohydrates, many, of, which, are, used, in, food, simple, sugars, also, called, monosaccharides, include, glucose, fructose, and, galactose, compound, sugars, also, called, disaccharides, or, double, sugars, are, molecules, made, of, two, bonded, monosaccharides, common, examples, are, sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose, glucose, galactose, and, maltose, two, molecules, of, glucose, white, sugar, is, a, refined, form, of, sucrose, in, the, body, compound, sugars, are, hydrolysed, into, simple, sugars, longer, chains, of, monosaccharides, 2, are, not, regarded, as, sugars, and, are, called, oligosaccharides, or, polysaccharides, starch, is, a, glucose, polymer, found, in, plants, the, most, abundant, source, of, energy, in, human, food, some, other, chemical, substances, such, as, ethylene, glycol, glycerol, and, sugar, alcohols, may, have, a, sweet, taste, but, are, not, classified, as, sugar, sugars, are, found, in, the, tissues, of, most, plants, honey, and, fruits, are, abundant, natural, sources, of, simple, sugars, sucrose, is, especially, concentrated, in, sugarcane, and, sugar, beet, making, them, ideal, for, efficient, commercial, extraction, to, make, refined, sugar, in, 2016, the, combined, world, production, of, those, two, crops, was, about, two, billion, tonnes, maltose, may, be, produced, by, malting, grain, lactose, is, the, only, sugar, that, cannot, be, extracted, from, plants, it, can, only, be, found, in, milk, including, human, breast, milk, and, in, some, dairy, products, a, cheap, source, of, sugar, is, corn, syrup, industrially, produced, by, converting, corn, starch, into, sugars, such, as, maltose, fructose, and, glucose, sucrose, is, used, in, prepared, foods, e, g, cookies, and, cakes, is, sometimes, added, to, commercially, available, ultra, processed, food, and, beverages, and, may, be, used, by, people, as, a, sweetener, for, foods, e, g, toast, and, cereal, and, beverages, e, g, coffee, and, tea, the, average, person, consumes, about, 24, kilograms, 53, pounds, of, sugar, each, year, with, north, and, south, americans, consuming, up, to, 50, kg, 110, lb, and, africans, consuming, under, 20, kg, 44, lb, as, free, sugar, consumption, grew, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, researchers, began, to, examine, whether, a, diet, high, in, free, sugar, especially, refined, sugar, was, damaging, to, human, health, in, 2015, the, world, health, organization, strongly, recommended, that, adults, and, children, reduce, their, intake, of, free, sugars, to, less, than, 10, of, their, total, energy, intake, and, encouraged, a, reduction, to, below, 5, in, general, high, sugar, consumption, damages, human, health, more, than, it, provides, nutritional, benefit, and, is, associated, with, a, risk, of, cardiometabolic, and, other, health, detriments, the, etymology, reflects, the, spread, of, the, commodity, from, sanskrit, arkar, meaning, ground, or, candied, sugar, came, persian, shakar, and, arabic, sukkar, the, arabic, word, was, borrowed, in, medieval, latin, as, succarum, whence, the, 12th, century, french, sucre, and, the, english, sugar, sugar, was, introduced, into, europe, by, the, arabs, in, sicily, and, spain, the, english, word, jaggery, a, coarse, brown, sugar, made, from, date, palm, sap, or, sugarcane, juice, has, a, similar, etymological, origin, portuguese, j, gara, from, the, malayalam, cakkar, which, is, from, the, sanskrit, arkar, sugar, has, been, produced, in, the, indian, subcontinent, since, ancient, times, and, its, cultivation, spread, from, there, into, modern, day, afghanistan, through, the, khyber, pass, it, was, not, plentiful, or, cheap, in, early, times, and, in, most, parts, of, the, world, honey, was, more, often, used, for, sweetening, originally, people, chewed, raw, sugarcane, to, extract, its, sweetness, even, after, refined, sugarcane, became, more, widely, available, during, the, european, colonial, era, palm, sugar, was, preferred, in, java, and, other, sugar, producing, parts, of, southeast, asia, and, along, with, coconut, sugar, is, still, used, locally, to, make, desserts, today, sugarcane, is, native, of, tropical, areas, such, as, the, indian, subcontinent, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, different, species, seem, to, have, originated, from, different, locations, with, saccharum, barberi, originating, in, india, and, s, edule, and, s, officinarum, coming, from, new, guinea, one, of, the, earliest, historical, references, to, sugarcane, is, in, chinese, manuscripts, dating, to, 8th, century, bce, which, state, that, the, use, of, sugarcane, originated, in, india, in, the, tradition, of, indian, medicine, yurveda, the, sugarcane, is, known, by, the, name, ik, u, and, the, sugarcane, juice, is, known, as, ph, ita, its, varieties, synonyms, and, characteristics, are, defined, in, nigha, us, such, as, the, bh, vaprak, a, 1, 6, 23, group, of, sugarcanes, sugar, remained, relatively, unimportant, until, the, indians, discovered, methods, of, turning, sugarcane, juice, into, granulated, crystals, that, were, easier, to, store, and, to, transport, a, process, the, greek, physician, pedanius, dioscorides, attested, to, in, his, 1st, century, ce, medical, treatise, de, materia, medica, there, is, a, kind, of, coalesced, honey, called, sakcharon, found, in, reeds, in, india, and, eudaimon, arabia, similar, in, consistency, to, salt, and, brittle, enough, to, be, broken, between, the, teeth, like, salt, in, the, local, indian, language, these, crystals, were, called, khanda, devanagari, kha, a, which, is, the, source, of, the, word, candy, indian, sailors, who, carried, clarified, butter, and, sugar, as, supplies, introduced, knowledge, of, sugar, along, the, various, trade, routes, they, travelled, traveling, buddhist, monks, took, sugar, crystallization, methods, to, china, during, the, reign, of, harsha, r, 606, 647, in, north, india, indian, envoys, in, tang, china, taught, methods, of, cultivating, sugarcane, after, emperor, taizong, of, tang, r, 626, 649, made, known, his, interest, in, sugar, china, established, its, first, sugarcane, plantations, in, the, seventh, century, chinese, documents, confirm, at, least, two, missions, to, india, initiated, in, 647, ce, to, obtain, technology, for, sugar, refining, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, middle, east, and, china, sugar, became, a, staple, of, cooking, and, desserts, nearchus, admiral, of, alexander, the, great, knew, of, sugar, during, the, year, 325, bc, because, of, his, participation, in, the, campaign, of, india, led, by, alexander, arrian, anabasis, in, addition, to, the, greek, physician, pedanius, dioscorides, the, roman, pliny, the, elder, also, described, sugar, in, his, 1st, century, ce, natural, history, sugar, is, made, in, arabia, as, well, but, indian, sugar, is, better, it, is, a, kind, of, honey, found, in, cane, white, as, gum, and, it, crunches, between, the, teeth, it, comes, in, lumps, the, size, of, a, hazelnut, sugar, is, used, only, for, medical, purposes, crusaders, brought, sugar, back, to, europe, after, their, campaigns, in, the, holy, land, where, they, encountered, caravans, carrying, sweet, salt, early, in, the, 12th, century, venice, acquired, some, villages, near, tyre, and, set, up, estates, to, produce, sugar, for, export, to, europe, it, supplemented, the, use, of, honey, which, had, previously, been, the, only, available, sweetener, crusade, chronicler, william, of, tyre, writing, in, the, late, 12th, century, described, sugar, as, very, necessary, for, the, use, and, health, of, mankind, in, the, 15th, century, venice, was, the, chief, sugar, refining, and, distribution, center, in, europe, there, was, a, drastic, change, in, the, mid, 15th, century, when, madeira, and, the, canary, islands, were, settled, from, europe, and, sugar, introduced, there, after, this, an, all, consuming, passion, for, sugar, swept, through, society, as, it, became, far, more, easily, available, though, initially, still, very, expensive, by, 1492, madeira, was, producing, over, 1, 400, 000, kilograms, 3, 000, 000, lb, of, sugar, annually, genoa, one, of, the, centers, of, distribution, became, known, for, candied, fruit, while, venice, specialized, in, pastries, sweets, candies, and, sugar, sculptures, sugar, was, considered, to, have, valuable, medicinal, properties, as, a, warm, food, under, prevailing, categories, being, helpful, to, the, stomach, to, cure, cold, diseases, and, sooth, lung, complaints, a, feast, given, in, tours, in, 1457, by, gaston, de, foix, which, is, probably, the, best, and, most, complete, account, we, have, of, a, late, medieval, banquet, includes, the, first, mention, of, sugar, sculptures, as, the, final, food, brought, in, was, a, heraldic, menagerie, sculpted, in, sugar, lions, stags, monkeys, each, holding, in, paw, or, beak, the, arms, of, the, hungarian, king, other, recorded, grand, feasts, in, the, decades, following, included, similar, pieces, originally, the, sculptures, seem, to, have, been, eaten, in, the, meal, but, later, they, become, merely, table, decorations, the, most, elaborate, called, trionfi, several, significant, sculptors, are, known, to, have, produced, them, in, some, cases, their, preliminary, drawings, survive, early, ones, were, in, brown, sugar, partly, cast, in, molds, with, the, final, touches, carved, they, continued, to, be, used, until, at, least, the, coronation, banquet, for, edward, vii, of, the, united, kingdom, in, 1903, among, other, sculptures, every, guest, was, given, a, sugar, crown, to, take, away, in, august, 1492, christopher, columbus, collected, sugar, cane, samples, in, la, gomera, in, the, canary, islands, and, introduced, it, to, the, new, world, the, cuttings, were, planted, and, the, first, sugar, cane, harvest, in, hispaniola, took, place, in, 1501, many, sugar, mills, had, been, constructed, in, cuba, and, jamaica, by, the, 1520s, the, portuguese, took, sugar, cane, to, brazil, by, 1540, there, were, 800, cane, sugar, mills, in, santa, catarina, island, and, another, 2, 000, on, the, north, coast, of, brazil, demarara, and, surinam, it, took, until, 1600, for, brazilian, sugar, production, to, exceed, that, of, s, o, tom, which, was, the, main, center, of, sugar, production, in, sixteenth, century, sugar, was, a, luxury, in, europe, until, the, early, 19th, century, when, it, became, more, widely, available, due, to, the, rise, of, beet, sugar, in, prussia, and, later, in, france, under, napoleon, beet, sugar, was, a, german, invention, since, in, 1747, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, announced, the, discovery, of, sugar, in, beets, and, devised, a, method, using, alcohol, to, extract, it, marggraf, s, student, franz, karl, achard, devised, an, economical, industrial, method, to, extract, the, sugar, in, its, pure, form, in, the, late, 18th, century, achard, first, produced, beet, sugar, in, 1783, in, kaulsdorf, and, in, 1801, the, world, s, first, beet, sugar, production, facility, was, established, in, cunern, silesia, then, part, of, prussia, now, poland, the, works, of, marggraf, and, achard, were, the, starting, point, for, the, sugar, industry, in, europe, and, for, the, modern, sugar, industry, in, general, since, sugar, was, no, longer, a, luxury, product, and, a, product, almost, only, produced, in, warmer, climates, sugar, became, highly, popular, and, by, the, 19th, century, was, found, in, every, household, this, evolution, of, taste, and, demand, for, sugar, as, an, essential, food, ingredient, resulted, in, major, economic, and, social, changes, demand, drove, in, part, the, colonization, of, tropical, islands, and, areas, where, labor, intensive, sugarcane, plantations, and, sugar, manufacturing, facilities, could, be, successful, world, consumption, increased, more, than, 100, times, from, 1850, to, 2000, led, by, britain, where, it, increased, from, about, 2, pounds, per, head, per, year, in, 1650, to, 90, pounds, by, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, late, 18th, century, britain, consumed, about, half, the, sugar, which, reached, europe, after, slavery, was, abolished, the, demand, for, workers, in, european, colonies, in, the, caribbean, was, filled, by, indentured, laborers, from, the, indian, subcontinent, millions, of, enslaved, or, indentured, laborers, were, brought, to, various, european, colonies, in, the, americas, africa, and, asia, as, a, result, of, demand, in, europe, for, among, other, commodities, sugar, influencing, the, ethnic, mixture, of, numerous, nations, around, the, globe, sugar, also, led, to, some, industrialization, of, areas, where, sugar, cane, was, grown, for, example, in, the, 1790s, lieutenant, j, paterson, of, the, bengal, presidency, promoted, to, the, british, parliament, the, idea, that, sugar, cane, could, grow, in, british, india, where, it, had, started, with, many, advantages, and, at, less, expense, than, in, the, west, indies, as, a, result, sugar, factories, were, established, in, bihar, in, eastern, india, during, the, napoleonic, wars, sugar, beet, production, increased, in, continental, europe, because, of, the, difficulty, of, importing, sugar, when, shipping, was, subject, to, blockade, by, 1880, the, sugar, beet, was, the, main, source, of, sugar, in, europe, it, was, also, cultivated, in, lincolnshire, and, other, parts, of, england, although, the, united, kingdom, continued, to, import, the, main, part, of, its, sugar, from, its, colonies, until, the, late, nineteenth, century, sugar, was, purchased, in, loaves, which, had, to, be, cut, using, implements, called, sugar, nips, in, later, years, granulated, sugar, was, more, usually, sold, in, bags, sugar, cubes, were, produced, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, inventor, of, a, process, to, produce, sugar, in, cube, form, was, jakob, christof, rad, director, of, a, sugar, refinery, in, da, ice, in, 1841, he, produced, the, first, sugar, cube, in, the, world, he, began, sugar, cube, production, after, being, granted, a, five, year, patent, for, the, process, on, 23, january, 1843, henry, tate, of, tate, lyle, was, another, early, manufacturer, of, sugar, cubes, at, his, refineries, in, liverpool, and, london, tate, purchased, a, patent, for, sugar, cube, manufacture, from, german, eugen, langen, who, in, 1872, had, invented, a, different, method, of, processing, of, sugar, cubes, sugar, was, rationed, during, world, war, i, though, it, was, said, that, no, previous, war, in, history, has, been, fought, so, largely, on, sugar, and, so, little, on, alcohol, and, more, sharply, during, world, war, ii, rationing, led, to, the, development, and, use, of, various, artificial, sweeteners, scientifically, sugar, loosely, refers, to, a, number, of, carbohydrates, such, as, monosaccharides, disaccharides, or, oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, are, also, called, simple, sugars, the, most, important, being, glucose, most, monosaccharides, have, a, formula, that, conforms, to, c, n, h, 2n, o, n, with, n, between, 3, and, 7, deoxyribose, being, an, exception, glucose, has, the, molecular, formula, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, the, names, of, typical, sugars, end, with, ose, as, in, glucose, and, fructose, sometimes, such, words, may, also, refer, to, any, types, of, carbohydrates, soluble, in, water, the, acyclic, mono, and, disaccharides, contain, either, aldehyde, groups, or, ketone, groups, these, carbon, oxygen, double, bonds, c, o, are, the, reactive, centers, all, saccharides, with, more, than, one, ring, in, their, structure, result, from, two, or, more, monosaccharides, joined, by, glycosidic, bonds, with, the, resultant, loss, of, a, molecule, of, water, h, 2, o, per, bond, monosaccharides, in, a, closed, chain, form, can, form, glycosidic, bonds, with, other, monosaccharides, creating, disaccharides, such, as, sucrose, and, polysaccharides, such, as, starch, or, cellulose, enzymes, must, hydrolyze, or, otherwise, break, these, glycosidic, bonds, before, such, compounds, become, metabolized, after, digestion, and, absorption, the, principal, monosaccharides, present, in, the, blood, and, internal, tissues, include, glucose, fructose, and, galactose, many, pentoses, and, hexoses, can, form, ring, structures, in, these, closed, chain, forms, the, aldehyde, or, ketone, group, remains, non, free, so, many, of, the, reactions, typical, of, these, groups, cannot, occur, glucose, in, solution, exists, mostly, in, the, ring, form, at, equilibrium, with, less, than, 0, 1, of, the, molecules, in, the, open, chain, form, biopolymers, of, sugars, are, common, in, nature, through, photosynthesis, plants, produce, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, g3p, a, phosphated, 3, carbon, sugar, that, is, used, by, the, cell, to, make, monosaccharides, such, as, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, or, as, in, cane, and, beet, sucrose, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, monosaccharides, may, be, further, converted, into, structural, polysaccharides, such, as, cellulose, and, pectin, for, cell, wall, construction, or, into, energy, reserves, in, the, form, of, storage, polysaccharides, such, as, starch, or, inulin, starch, consisting, of, two, different, polymers, of, glucose, is, a, readily, degradable, form, of, chemical, energy, stored, by, cells, and, can, be, converted, to, other, types, of, energy, another, polymer, of, glucose, is, cellulose, which, is, a, linear, chain, composed, of, several, hundred, or, thousand, glucose, units, it, is, used, by, plants, as, a, structural, component, in, their, cell, walls, humans, can, digest, cellulose, only, to, a, very, limited, extent, though, ruminants, can, do, so, with, the, help, of, symbiotic, bacteria, in, their, gut, dna, and, rna, are, built, up, of, the, monosaccharides, deoxyribose, and, ribose, respectively, deoxyribose, has, the, formula, c, 5, h, 10, o, 4, and, ribose, the, formula, c, 5, h, 10, o, 5, because, sugars, burn, easily, when, exposed, to, flame, the, handling, of, sugars, risks, dust, explosion, the, risk, of, explosion, is, higher, when, the, sugar, has, been, milled, to, superfine, texture, such, as, for, use, in, chewing, gum, the, 2008, georgia, sugar, refinery, explosion, which, killed, 14, people, and, injured, 36, and, destroyed, most, of, the, refinery, was, caused, by, the, ignition, of, sugar, dust, in, its, culinary, use, exposing, sugar, to, heat, causes, caramelization, as, the, process, occurs, volatile, chemicals, such, as, diacetyl, are, released, producing, the, characteristic, caramel, flavor, fructose, galactose, and, glucose, are, all, simple, sugars, monosaccharides, with, the, general, formula, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, they, have, five, hydroxyl, groups, oh, and, a, carbonyl, group, c, o, and, are, cyclic, when, dissolved, in, water, they, each, exist, as, several, isomers, with, dextro, and, laevo, rotatory, forms, that, cause, polarized, light, to, diverge, to, the, right, or, the, left, lactose, maltose, and, sucrose, are, all, compound, sugars, disaccharides, with, the, general, formula, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, they, are, formed, by, the, combination, of, two, monosaccharide, molecules, with, the, exclusion, of, a, molecule, of, water, the, sugar, contents, of, common, fruits, and, vegetables, are, presented, in, table, 1, due, to, rising, demand, sugar, production, in, general, increased, some, 14, over, the, period, 2009, to, 2018, the, largest, importers, were, china, indonesia, and, the, united, states, sugar, cane, accounted, for, around, 21, of, the, global, crop, production, over, the, 2000, 2021, period, the, americas, was, the, leading, region, in, the, production, of, sugar, cane, 52, of, the, world, total, global, production, of, sugarcane, in, 2020, was, 1, 9, billion, tonnes, with, brazil, producing, 40, of, the, world, total, and, india, 20, table, sugarcane, refers, to, any, of, several, species, or, their, hybrids, of, giant, grasses, in, the, genus, saccharum, in, the, family, poaceae, they, have, been, cultivated, in, tropical, climates, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, southeast, asia, over, centuries, for, the, sucrose, found, in, their, stems, a, great, expansion, in, sugarcane, production, took, place, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, establishment, of, slave, plantations, in, the, americas, the, use, of, slavery, for, the, labor, intensive, process, resulted, in, sugar, production, enabling, prices, cheap, enough, for, most, people, to, buy, mechanization, reduced, some, labor, needs, but, in, the, 21st, century, cultivation, and, production, relied, on, low, wage, laborers, sugar, cane, requires, a, frost, free, climate, with, sufficient, rainfall, during, the, growing, season, to, make, full, use, of, the, plant, s, substantial, growth, potential, the, crop, is, harvested, mechanically, or, by, hand, chopped, into, lengths, and, conveyed, rapidly, to, the, processing, plant, commonly, known, as, a, sugar, mill, where, it, is, either, milled, and, the, juice, extracted, with, water, or, extracted, by, diffusion, the, juice, is, clarified, with, lime, and, heated, to, destroy, enzymes, the, resulting, thin, syrup, is, concentrated, in, a, series, of, evaporators, after, which, further, water, is, removed, the, resulting, supersaturated, solution, is, seeded, with, sugar, crystals, facilitating, crystal, formation, and, drying, molasses, is, a, by, product, of, the, process, and, the, fiber, from, the, stems, known, as, bagasse, is, burned, to, provide, energy, for, the, sugar, extraction, process, the, crystals, of, raw, sugar, have, a, sticky, brown, coating, and, either, can, be, used, as, they, are, can, be, bleached, by, sulfur, dioxide, or, can, be, treated, in, a, carbonatation, process, to, produce, a, whiter, product, about, 2, 500, litres, 660, us, gal, of, irrigation, water, is, needed, for, every, one, kilogram, 2, 2, pounds, of, sugar, produced, in, 2020, global, production, of, sugar, beets, was, 253, million, tonnes, led, by, russia, with, 13, of, the, world, total, table, the, sugar, beet, became, a, major, source, of, sugar, in, the, 19th, century, when, methods, for, extracting, the, sugar, became, available, it, is, a, biennial, plant, a, cultivated, variety, of, beta, vulgaris, in, the, family, amaranthaceae, the, tuberous, root, of, which, contains, a, high, proportion, of, sucrose, it, is, cultivated, as, a, root, crop, in, temperate, regions, with, adequate, rainfall, and, requires, a, fertile, soil, the, crop, is, harvested, mechanically, in, the, autumn, and, the, crown, of, leaves, and, excess, soil, removed, the, roots, do, not, deteriorate, rapidly, and, may, be, left, in, the, field, for, some, weeks, before, being, transported, to, the, processing, plant, where, the, crop, is, washed, and, sliced, and, the, sugar, extracted, by, diffusion, milk, of, lime, is, added, to, the, raw, juice, with, calcium, carbonate, after, water, is, evaporated, by, boiling, the, syrup, under, a, vacuum, the, syrup, is, cooled, and, seeded, with, sugar, crystals, the, white, sugar, that, crystallizes, can, be, separated, in, a, centrifuge, and, dried, requiring, no, further, refining, refined, sugar, is, made, from, raw, sugar, that, has, undergone, a, refining, process, to, remove, the, molasses, raw, sugar, is, sucrose, which, is, extracted, from, sugarcane, or, sugar, beet, while, raw, sugar, can, be, consumed, the, refining, process, removes, unwanted, tastes, and, results, in, refined, sugar, or, white, sugar, the, sugar, may, be, transported, in, bulk, to, the, country, where, it, will, be, used, and, the, refining, process, often, takes, place, there, the, first, stage, is, known, as, affination, and, involves, immersing, the, sugar, crystals, in, a, concentrated, syrup, that, softens, and, removes, the, sticky, brown, coating, without, dissolving, them, the, crystals, are, then, separated, from, the, liquor, and, dissolved, in, water, the, resulting, syrup, is, treated, either, by, a, carbonatation, or, by, a, phosphatation, process, both, involve, the, precipitation, of, a, fine, solid, in, the, syrup, and, when, this, is, filtered, out, many, of, the, impurities, are, removed, at, the, same, time, removal, of, color, is, achieved, by, using, either, a, granular, activated, carbon, or, an, ion, exchange, resin, the, sugar, syrup, is, concentrated, by, boiling, and, then, cooled, and, seeded, with, sugar, crystals, causing, the, sugar, to, crystallize, out, the, liquor, is, spun, off, in, a, centrifuge, and, the, white, crystals, are, dried, in, hot, air, and, ready, to, be, packaged, or, used, the, surplus, liquor, is, made, into, refiners, molasses, the, international, commission, for, uniform, methods, of, sugar, analysis, sets, standards, for, the, measurement, of, the, purity, of, refined, sugar, known, as, icumsa, numbers, lower, numbers, indicate, a, higher, level, of, purity, in, the, refined, sugar, refined, sugar, is, widely, used, for, industrial, needs, for, higher, quality, refined, sugar, is, purer, icumsa, below, 300, than, raw, sugar, icumsa, over, 1, 500, the, level, of, purity, associated, with, the, colors, of, sugar, expressed, by, standard, number, icumsa, the, smaller, icumsa, numbers, indicate, the, higher, purity, of, sugar, brown, sugars, are, granulated, sugars, either, containing, residual, molasses, or, with, the, grains, deliberately, coated, with, molasses, to, produce, a, light, or, dark, colored, sugar, they, are, used, in, baked, goods, confectionery, and, toffees, their, darkness, is, due, to, the, amount, of, molasses, they, contain, they, may, be, classified, based, on, their, darkness, or, country, of, origin, for, instance, worldwide, sugar, provides, 10, of, the, daily, calories, based, on, a, 2000, kcal, diet, in, 1750, the, average, briton, got, 72, calories, a, day, from, sugar, in, 1913, this, had, risen, to, 395, in, 2015, sugar, still, provided, around, 14, of, the, calories, in, british, diets, according, to, one, source, per, capita, consumption, of, sugar, in, 2016, was, highest, in, the, united, states, followed, by, germany, and, the, netherlands, brown, and, white, granulated, sugar, are, 97, to, nearly, 100, carbohydrates, respectively, with, less, than, 2, water, and, no, dietary, fiber, protein, or, fat, table, brown, sugar, contains, a, moderate, amount, of, iron, 15, of, the, reference, daily, intake, in, a, 100, gram, amount, see, table, but, a, typical, serving, of, 4, grams, one, teaspoon, would, provide, 15, calories, and, a, negligible, amount, of, iron, or, any, other, nutrient, because, brown, sugar, contains, 5, 10, molasses, reintroduced, during, processing, its, value, to, some, consumers, is, a, richer, flavor, than, white, sugar, high, sugar, consumption, damages, human, health, more, than, it, provides, nutritional, benefit, and, in, particular, is, associated, with, a, risk, of, cardiometabolic, health, detriments, sugar, refiners, and, manufacturers, of, sugary, foods, and, drinks, have, sought, to, influence, medical, research, and, public, health, recommendations, with, substantial, and, largely, clandestine, spending, documented, from, the, 1960s, to, 2016, the, results, of, research, on, the, health, effects, of, sugary, food, and, drink, differ, significantly, depending, on, whether, the, researcher, has, financial, ties, to, the, food, and, drink, industry, a, 2013, medical, review, concluded, that, unhealthy, commodity, industries, should, have, no, role, in, the, formation, of, national, or, international, ncd, policy, there, have, been, similar, efforts, to, steer, coverage, of, sugar, related, health, information, in, popular, media, including, news, media, and, social, media, a, 2003, technical, report, by, the, world, health, organization, who, provides, evidence, that, high, intake, of, sugary, drinks, including, fruit, juice, increases, the, risk, of, obesity, by, adding, to, overall, energy, intake, by, itself, sugar, is, not, a, factor, causing, obesity, and, metabolic, syndrome, but, rather, when, over, consumed, is, a, component, of, unhealthy, dietary, behavior, meta, analyses, showed, that, excessive, consumption, of, sugar, sweetened, beverages, increased, the, risk, of, developing, type, 2, diabetes, and, metabolic, syndrome, including, weight, gain, and, obesity, in, adults, and, children, sugar, consumption, does, not, directly, cause, cancer, cancer, council, australia, have, stated, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, consuming, sugar, makes, cancer, cells, grow, faster, or, cause, cancer, there, is, an, indirect, relationship, between, sugar, consumption, and, obesity, related, cancers, through, increased, risk, of, excess, body, weight, the, american, institute, for, cancer, research, and, world, cancer, research, fund, recommend, that, people, limit, sugar, consumption, there, is, a, popular, misconception, that, cancer, can, be, treated, by, reducing, sugar, and, carbohydrate, intake, to, supposedly, starve, tumours, in, reality, the, health, of, people, with, cancer, is, best, served, by, maintaining, a, healthy, diet, despite, some, studies, suggesting, that, sugar, consumption, causes, hyperactivity, the, quality, of, evidence, is, low, and, it, is, generally, accepted, within, the, scientific, community, that, the, notion, of, children, s, sugar, rush, is, a, myth, a, 2019, meta, analysis, found, that, sugar, consumption, does, not, improve, mood, but, can, lower, alertness, and, increase, fatigue, within, an, hour, of, consumption, one, review, of, low, quality, studies, of, children, consuming, high, amounts, of, energy, drinks, showed, association, with, higher, rates, of, unhealthy, behaviors, including, smoking, and, excessive, alcohol, use, and, with, hyperactivity, and, insomnia, although, such, effects, could, not, be, specifically, attributed, to, sugar, over, other, components, of, those, drinks, such, as, caffeine, the, who, action, on, sugar, and, the, scientific, advisory, committee, on, nutrition, sacn, consider, free, sugars, an, essential, dietary, factor, in, the, development, of, dental, caries, who, have, stated, that, dental, caries, can, be, prevented, by, avoiding, dietary, free, sugars, a, review, of, human, studies, showed, that, the, incidence, of, caries, is, lower, when, sugar, intake, is, less, than, 10, of, total, energy, consumed, sugar, sweetened, beverage, consumption, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, tooth, decay, the, empty, calories, argument, states, that, a, diet, high, in, added, or, free, sugars, will, reduce, consumption, of, foods, that, contain, essential, nutrients, this, nutrient, displacement, occurs, if, sugar, makes, up, more, than, 25, of, daily, energy, intake, a, proportion, associated, with, poor, diet, quality, and, risk, of, obesity, displacement, may, occur, at, lower, levels, of, consumption, the, who, recommends, that, both, adults, and, children, reduce, the, intake, of, free, sugars, to, less, than, 10, of, total, energy, intake, and, suggests, a, reduction, to, below, 5, free, sugars, include, monosaccharides, and, disaccharides, added, to, foods, and, sugars, found, in, fruit, juice, and, concentrates, as, well, as, in, honey, and, syrups, according, to, the, who, hese, recommendations, were, based, on, the, totality, of, available, evidence, reviewed, regarding, the, relationship, between, free, sugars, intake, and, body, weight, low, and, moderate, quality, evidence, and, dental, caries, very, low, and, moderate, quality, evidence, on, 20, may, 2016, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, announced, changes, to, the, nutrition, facts, panel, displayed, on, all, foods, to, be, effective, by, july, 2018, new, to, the, panel, is, a, requirement, to, list, added, sugars, by, weight, and, as, a, percent, of, daily, value, dv, for, vitamins, and, minerals, the, intent, of, dvs, is, to, indicate, how, much, should, be, consumed, for, added, sugars, the, guidance, is, that, 100, dv, should, not, be, exceeded, 100, dv, is, defined, as, 50, grams, for, a, person, consuming, 2000, calories, a, day, 50, grams, is, equal, to, 200, calories, and, thus, 10, of, total, calories, the, same, guidance, as, the, who, to, put, this, in, context, most, 12, us, fluid, ounce, 355, ml, cans, of, soda, contain, 39, grams, of, sugar, in, the, united, states, a, government, survey, on, food, consumption, in, 2013, 2014, reported, that, for, men, and, women, aged, 20, and, older, the, average, total, sugar, intakes, naturally, occurring, in, foods, and, added, were, respectively, 125, and, 99, g, day, various, culinary, sugars, have, different, densities, due, to, differences, in, particle, size, and, inclusion, of, moisture, domino, sugar, gives, the, following, weight, to, volume, conversions, in, united, states, customary, units, the, engineering, resources, bulk, density, chart, published, in, powder, and, bulk, gives, different, values, for, the, bulk, densities, manufacturers, of, sugary, products, such, as, soft, drinks, and, candy, and, the, sugar, research, foundation, have, been, accused, of, trying, to, influence, consumers, and, medical, associations, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, by, creating, doubt, about, the, potential, health, hazards, of, sucrose, overconsumption, while, promoting, saturated, fat, as, the, main, dietary, risk, factor, in, cardiovascular, diseases, in, 2016, the, criticism, led, to, recommendations, that, diet, policymakers, emphasize, the, need, for, high, quality, research, that, accounts, for, multiple, biomarkers, on, development, of, cardiovascular, diseases, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, free, content, work, licensed, under, cc, by,
