inherits, an, x, chromosome, from, the, mother, and, a, y, chromosome, from, the, father, sex, differentiation, of, the, male, fetus, is, governed, by, the, sry, gene, on, the, y, chromosome, during, puberty, hormones, which, stimulate, androgen, production, result, in, the, development, of, secondary, sexual, characteristics, that, result, in, even, more, differences, between, the, sexes, these, include, greater, muscle, mass, greater, height, the, growth, of, facial, hair, and, a, lower, body, fat, composition, male, anatomy, is, distinguished, from, female, anatomy, by, the, male,

a, sperm, cell, carrying, a, y, chromosome, fertilizes, the, female, ovum, the, offspring, will, have, a, male, karyotype, xy, the, sry, gene, is, typically, found, on, the, y, chromosome, and, causes, the, development, of, the, testes, which, in, turn, govern, other, aspects, of, male, sex, differentiation, sex, differentiation, in, males, proceeds, in, a, testes, dependent, way, while, female, differentiation, is, not, gonad, dependent, primary, sex, characteristics, or, sex, organs, are, characteristics, that, are, present, at, birth, and, are, integral, to, the, reproductive, process, for, men, primary, sex, characteristics, include, the, penis, and, testicles, adult, humans, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, in, many, other, characteristics, many, of, which, have, no, direct, link, to, reproductive, ability, humans, are, sexually, dimorphic, in, body, size, body, structure, and, body, composition, men, tend, to, be, taller, and, heavier, than, women, and, adjusted, for, height, men, tend, to, have, greater, lean, and, bone, mass, than, women, and, lower, fat, mass, secondary, sex, characteristics, are, features, that, appear, during, puberty, in, humans, such, features, are, especially, evident, in, the, sexually, dimorphic, phenotypic, traits, that, distinguish, between, the, sexes, but, unlike, the, primary, sex, characteristics, are, not, directly, part, of, the, reproductive, system, secondary, sexual, characteristics, that, are, specific, to, men, include, men, weigh, more, than, women, on, average, men, are, taller, than, women, by, about, 10, on, average, men, have, a, larger, waist, in, comparison, to, their, hips, see, waist, hip, ratio, than, women, in, women, the, index, and, ring, fingers, tend, to, be, either, more, similar, in, size, or, their, index, finger, is, slightly, longer, than, their, ring, finger, whereas, men, s, ring, finger, tends, to, be, longer, the, internal, male, genitalia, consist, of, the, testicles, gonads, that, produce, male, gametes, called, sperm, the, prostate, seminal, vesicles, and, bulbourethral, glands, accessory, glands, that, partake, in, sperm, health, the, epididymides, organs, that, store, sperm, cells, and, the, vasa, deferentia, and, ejaculatory, ducts, tubular, structures, that, transfer, the, mature, sperm, to, the, urethra, the, external, male, genitalia, consist, of, the, penis, an, organ, that, expels, semen, and, the, scrotum, a, pouch, of, skin, housing, the, testicles, the, male, reproductive, system, s, function, is, to, produce, semen, which, carries, sperm, and, thus, genetic, information, that, can, unite, with, an, egg, within, a, woman, since, sperm, that, enters, a, woman, s, uterus, and, then, fallopian, tubes, goes, on, to, fertilize, an, egg, which, develops, into, a, fetus, or, child, the, male, reproductive, system, plays, no, necessary, role, during, the, gestation, the, study, of, male, reproduction, and, associated, organs, is, called, andrology, testosterone, stimulates, the, development, of, the, wolffian, ducts, the, penis, and, closure, of, the, labioscrotal, folds, into, the, scrotum, another, significant, hormone, in, sexual, differentiation, is, the, anti, m, llerian, hormone, which, inhibits, the, development, of, the, m, llerian, ducts, for, males, during, puberty, testosterone, along, with, gonadotropins, released, by, the, pituitary, gland, stimulates, spermatogenesis, while, a, majority, of, the, global, health, gender, disparities, is, weighted, against, women, there, are, situations, in, which, men, tend, to, fare, poorer, one, such, instance, is, armed, conflicts, where, men, are, often, the, immediate, victims, a, study, of, conflicts, in, 13, countries, from, 1955, to, 2002, found, that, 81, of, all, violent, war, deaths, were, male, apart, from, armed, conflicts, areas, with, high, incidence, of, violence, such, as, regions, controlled, by, drug, cartels, also, see, men, experiencing, higher, mortality, rates, this, stems, from, social, beliefs, that, associate, ideals, of, masculinity, with, aggressive, confrontational, behavior, lastly, sudden, and, drastic, changes, in, economic, environments, and, the, loss, of, social, safety, nets, in, particular, social, subsidies, and, food, stamps, have, also, been, linked, to, higher, levels, of, alcohol, consumption, and, psychological, stress, among, men, leading, to, a, spike, in, male, mortality, rates, this, is, because, such, situations, often, makes, it, harder, for, men, to, provide, for, their, family, a, task, that, has, been, long, regarded, as, the, essence, of, masculinity, a, retrospective, analyses, of, people, infected, with, the, common, cold, found, that, doctors, underrate, the, symptoms, of, men, and, are, more, willing, to, attribute, symptoms, and, illness, to, women, than, men, women, live, longer, than, men, in, all, countries, and, across, all, age, groups, for, which, reliable, records, exist, in, the, united, states, men, are, less, healthy, than, women, across, all, social, classes, non, white, men, are, especially, unhealthy, men, are, over, represented, in, dangerous, occupations, and, represent, a, majority, of, on, the, job, deaths, further, medical, doctors, provide, men, with, less, service, less, advice, and, spend, less, time, with, men, than, they, do, with, women, per, medical, encounter, male, sexuality, and, attraction, varies, between, individuals, and, a, man, s, sexual, behavior, can, be, affected, by, many, factors, including, evolved, predispositions, personality, upbringing, and, culture, while, most, men, are, heterosexual, significant, minorities, are, homosexual, or, bisexual, most, cultures, use, a, gender, binary, in, which, man, is, one, of, the, two, genders, the, other, being, woman, most, men, are, cisgender, and, their, gender, identity, aligns, with, their, male, sex, assignment, at, birth, trans, men, have, a, male, gender, identity, that, does, not, align, with, their, female, sex, assignment, at, birth, and, may, undergo, masculinizing, hormone, replacement, therapy, and, or, sex, reassignment, surgery, intersex, men, may, have, sex, characteristics, that, do, not, fit, typical, notions, of, male, biology, a, 2016, systemic, review, estimated, that, 0, 256, of, people, self, identify, as, female, to, male, transgender, a, 2017, survey, of, 80, 929, minnesota, students, found, that, roughly, twice, as, many, female, assigned, adolescents, self, identified, as, transgender, compared, to, adolescents, with, a, male, sex, assignment, masculinity, also, sometimes, called, manhood, or, manliness, is, the, set, of, personality, traits, and, attributes, associated, with, boys, and, men, although, masculinity, is, socially, constructed, some, research, indicates, that, some, behaviors, considered, masculine, are, biologically, influenced, to, what, extent, masculinity, is, biologically, or, socially, influenced, is, subject, to, debate, it, is, distinct, from, the, definition, of, the, biological, male, sex, as, both, males, and, females, can, exhibit, masculine, traits, men, generally, face, social, stigma, for, embodying, feminine, traits, more, so, than, women, do, for, embodying, masculine, traits, this, can, also, manifest, as, homophobia, standards, of, manliness, or, masculinity, vary, across, different, cultures, and, historical, periods, while, the, outward, signs, of, masculinity, look, different, in, different, cultures, there, are, some, common, aspects, to, its, definition, across, cultures, in, all, cultures, in, the, past, and, still, among, traditional, and, non, western, cultures, getting, married, is, the, most, common, and, definitive, distinction, between, boyhood, and, manhood, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, qualities, traditionally, associated, with, marriage, such, as, the, triple, ps, of, protecting, providing, and, procreating, were, still, considered, signs, of, having, achieved, manhood, platonic, relationships, are, not, significantly, different, between, men, and, women, though, some, differences, do, exist, friendships, involving, men, tend, to, be, based, more, on, shared, activities, than, self, disclosure, and, personal, connection, perceptions, of, friendship, involving, men, varies, among, cultures, and, time, periods, in, heterosexual, romantic, relationships, men, are, typically, expected, to, take, a, proactive, role, initiate, the, relationship, plan, dates, and, propose, marriage, anthropology, has, shown, that, masculinity, itself, has, social, status, just, like, wealth, race, and, social, class, in, western, culture, for, example, greater, masculinity, usually, brings, greater, social, status, many, english, words, such, as, virtue, and, virile, from, the, indo, european, root, vir, meaning, man, reflect, this, in, most, cultures, male, privilege, allows, men, more, rights, and, privileges, than, women, in, societies, where, men, are, not, given, special, legal, privileges, they, typically, hold, more, positions, of, power, and, men, are, seen, as, being, taken, more, seriously, in, society, this, is, associated, with, a, gender, role, strain, in, which, men, face, increased, societal, pressure, to, conform, to, gender, roles, the, earliest, known, recorded, name, of, a, man, in, writing, is, potentially, kushim, who, would, have, lived, sometime, between, 3400, and, 3000, bc, in, the, sumerian, city, of, uruk, though, his, name, may, have, been, a,

role, in, raising, children, in, most, societies, men, would, traditionally, marry, a, woman, when, raising, children, but, in, modern, times, many, countries, now, allow, for, same, sex, marriage, and, for, those, couples, to, raise, children, either, via, adoption, or, surrogacy, men, may, be, single, parents, and, are, increasingly, so, in, modern, times, though, women, are, three, times, more, likely, to, be, single, parents, than, men, in, paternal, societies, men, have, typically, have, been, regarded, as, the, head, of, household, and, held, additional, social, privileges, the,

that, were, not, available, to, women, such, jobs, tended, to, be, either, more, strenuous, more, prestigious, or, more, dangerous, modern, men, increasingly, take, untraditional, career, paths, such, as, staying, home, and, raising, children, while, their, partner, works, modern, men, tend, to, work, longer, than, women, which, impacts, their, ability, to, spend, time, with, their, families, even,
