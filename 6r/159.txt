living, nearby, or, in, the, same, household, particular, forms, include, the, stem, and, joint, families, in, some, circumstances, the, extended, family, comes, to, live, either, with, or, in, place, of, a, member, of, the, immediate, family, these, families, include, in, one, household, or, close, proximity, relatives, in, addition, to, an, immediate, family, an, example, would, be, an, elderly, parent, who, moves, in, with, his, or, her, children, due, to, old, age, in, modern, western, cultures, dominated, by, immediate, family, constructs, the, term, has, come, to, be, used, generically, to, refer, to, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and, cousins, whether, they, live, together, within, the, same, household, or, not, however, it, may, also, refer, to, a, family, unit, in, which, several, generations, live, together, within, a, single, household, in, some, cultures, the, term, is, used, synonymously, with, consanguineous, family, a, stem, family, is, a, kind, of, extended, family, first, discussed, by, fr, d, ric, le, play, parents, will, live, with, one, child, and, his, her, spouse, as, well, as, the, children, of, both, while, other, children, will, leave, the, house, or, remain, in, it, unmarried, the, stem, family, is, sometimes, associated, with, inegalitarian, inheritance, practices, as, in, japan, and, korea, but, the, term, has, also, been, used, in, some, contexts, to, describe, a, family, type, where, parents, live, with, a, married, child, and, his, or, her, spouse, and, children, but, the, transfer, of, land, and, moveable, property, is, more, or, less, egalitarian, as, in, the, case, of, traditional, romania, northeastern, thailand, or, mesoamerican, indigenous, peoples, in, these, cases, the, child, who, cares, for, the, parents, usually, receives, the, house, in, addition, to, his, or, her, own, share, of, land, and, moveable, property, often, it, has, been, presumed, that, extended, family, groups, sharing, a, single, household, enjoy, specific, advantages, such, as, a, greater, sense, of, security, and, belonging, due, to, sharing, a, wider, pool, of, members, to, serve, as, resources, during, a, crisis, and, more, role, models, to, help, perpetuate, desired, behavior, and, cultural, values, however, even, in, cultures, in, which, adults, are, expected, to, leave, home, after, marriage, to, begin, their, own, nuclear, based, households, the, extended, family, often, forms, an, important, support, network, offering, similar, advantages, particularly, in, working, class, communities, grown, children, tend, to, establish, their, own, households, within, the, same, general, area, as, their, parents, aunts, uncles, and, grandparents, these, extended, family, members, tend, to, gather, often, for, family, events, and, to, feel, responsible, for, helping, and, supporting, one, another, both, emotionally, and, financially, while, contemporary, families, may, be, considered, more, mobile, in, general, than, in, the, past, sociologists, find, that, this, has, not, necessarily, resulted, in, the, disintegration, of, extended, family, networks, rather, technological, aids, such, as, the, internet, and, social, networking, sites, such, as, facebook, are, now, commonly, used, to, retain, contact, and, maintain, these, family, ties, particularly, in, the, case, of, single, parent, households, it, can, be, helpful, for, extended, family, members, to, share, a, single, household, in, order, to, share, the, burden, of, meeting, expenses, on, the, other, hand, sharing, a, household, can, present, a, disadvantage, depending, on, the, sizes, and, number, of, families, involved, particularly, when, only, a, few, members, shoulder, most, of, the, responsibility, to, meet, expenses, for, the, family, s, basic, needs, an, estimated, 49, million, americans, 16, 1, of, the, total, population, live, in, homes, comprising, three, or, more, generations, up, from, 42, million, in, 2000, this, situation, is, similar, in, western, europe, another, 34, percent, live, within, a, kilometer, of, their, children, in, many, cultures, such, as, in, those, of, asians, middle, easterners, africans, indigenous, peoples, like, native, americans, and, pacific, islanders, and, latin, americans, and, caribbeans, even, for, eastern, europeans, and, southern, europeans, orthodox, catholic, countries, extended, families, are, the, basic, family, unit, that, is, to, say, the, modern, western, nuclear, family, is, not, the, norm, even, in, western, europe, extended, families, mostly, of, the, stem, type, were, also, clearly, prevalent, england, being, a, rare, exception, in, britain, and, the, united, states, during, the, industrial, revolution, approximately, 1750, to, 1900, more, people, lived, in, extended, families, than, at, any, time, before, or, since, it, is, common, for, today, s, world, to, have, older, children, in, nuclear, families, to, reach, walking, up, to, driving, age, ranges, before, meeting, extended, family, members, geographical, isolation, is, common, for, middle, class, families, who, move, based, on, occupational, opportunities, while, family, branches, retain, basic, independence, some, extended, families, hold, family, reunions, or, opportunities, for, gathering, regularly, normally, around, holiday, time, frames, to, reestablish, and, integrate, a, stronger, family, connection, this, allows, individual, nuclear, families, to, connect, with, extended, family, members, where, families, consist, of, multiple, generations, living, together, the, family, is, usually, headed, by, the, elders, more, often, than, not, it, consists, of, grandparents, their, sons, and, their, sons, families, in, patriarchal, and, especially, patrilineal, societies, extended, families, make, discussions, together, and, solve, the, problem, historically, for, generations, south, asia, had, a, prevailing, tradition, of, the, joint, family, system, or, undivided, family, the, joint, family, system, is, an, extended, family, arrangement, prevalent, throughout, the, indian, subcontinent, particularly, in, india, consisting, of, many, generations, living, in, the, same, home, all, bound, by, the, common, relationship, a, patrilineal, joint, family, consists, of, an, older, man, and, his, wife, his, sons, and, unmarried, daughters, his, sons, wives, and, children, the, family, is, headed, by, a, patriarch, usually, the, oldest, male, who, makes, decisions, on, economic, and, social, matters, on, behalf, of, the, entire, family, the, patriarch, s, wife, generally, exerts, control, over, the, household, minor, religious, practices, and, often, wields, considerable, influence, in, domestic, matters, family, income, flows, into, a, common, pool, from, which, resources, are, drawn, to, meet, the, needs, of, all, members, which, are, regulated, by, the, heads, of, the, family, in, the, early, stages, of, the, twentieth, century, it, was, not, very, common, to, find, many, families, with, extended, kin, in, their, household, which, may, have, been, due, to, the, idea, that, the, young, people, in, these, times, typically, waited, to, establish, themselves, and, start, a, household, before, they, married, and, filled, a, home, as, life, expectancy, becomes, older, and, programs, such, as, social, security, benefit, the, elderly, the, old, are, now, beginning, to, live, longer, than, prior, generations, which, then, may, lead, to, generations, mixing, together, according, to, results, of, a, study, by, pew, research, center, in, 2010, approximately, 50, million, nearly, one, in, six, americans, including, rising, numbers, of, seniors, live, in, households, with, at, least, two, adult, generations, and, often, three, it, has, become, an, ongoing, trend, for, elderly, generations, to, move, in, and, live, with, their, children, as, they, can, give, them, support, and, help, with, everyday, living, the, main, reasons, cited, for, this, shift, are, an, increase, in, unemployment, and, slumped, housing, prices, and, arrival, of, new, immigrants, from, asian, and, south, american, countries, according, to, the, u, s, census, bureau, there, were, 2, 7, million, grandparents, raising, their, grandchildren, in, 2009, the, dramatic, increase, in, grandparent, headed, households, has, been, attributed, to, many, factors, including, parental, substance, abuse, in, 2003, the, number, of, u, s, family, groups, where, one, or, more, subfamilies, live, in, a, household, e, g, a, householder, s, daughter, has, a, child, the, mother, child, is, a, subfamily, was, 79, million, two, point, six, million, of, u, s, multigenerational, family, households, in, 2000, had, a, householder, the, householder, s, children, and, the, householder, s, grandchildren, that, is, 65, percent, of, multigenerational, family, households, in, the, u, s, so, it, is, twice, as, common, for, a, grandparent, to, be, the, householder, than, for, adult, children, to, bring, parents, into, their, home, the, increase, in, the, number, of, multigenerational, households, has, created, complex, legal, issues, such, as, who, in, the, household, has, authority, to, consent, to, police, searches, of, the, family, home, or, private, bedrooms, besides, the, legal, issues, that, multigenerational, households, could, create, there, are, issues, that, may, arise, from, households, where, the, grandparents, are, the, sole, guardians, the, supporting, grandparents, raising, grandchildren, act, was, signed, into, law, on, july, 7, 2018, after, unanimously, passing, the, u, s, house, and, senate, it, was, first, introduced, in, the, senate, on, may, 10, 2017, by, senators, susan, collins, r, me, and, bob, casey, jr, d, pa, out, of, this, came, the, supporting, grandparents, raising, grandchildren, advisory, council, which, will, identify, promote, coordinate, and, disseminate, to, the, public, information, resources, and, the, best, practices, available, to, help, grandparents, and, other, older, relatives, both, meet, the, needs, of, the, children, in, their, care, and, maintain, their, own, physical, and, mental, health, and, emotional, well, being, mexican, society, is, composed, of, three, generational, units, consisting, of, grandparents, children, and, grandchildren, further, close, relationships, are, maintained, with, the, progenitors, of, these, families, and, are, known, as, kin, or, cousins, when, one, is, born, they, are, born, into, two, extended, families, a, kinship, group, of, sometimes, 70, people, the, group, traditionally, acts, as, a, cohesive, unit, pooling, resources, and, influence, the, extended, family, also, consists, of, spouses, and, siblings, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, two, generational, american, nuclear, family, some, scholars, have, used, the, term, grand, family, to, describe, the, close, relationship, between, grandparents, children, and, grandchildren, in, mexican, society, larissa, a, lomnitz, and, marisol, perez, lizaur, for, example, describe, the, grand, family, as, the, basic, unit, of, family, solidarity, in, mexico, where, basic, family, obligations, between, grandparents, children, and, grandchildren, include, economic, support, participation, in, family, rituals, and, social, recognition, the, relative, economic, deprivation, of, racial, and, ethnic, minorities, leads, to, higher, levels, of, extended, family, involvement, primarily, because, blacks, and, latinos, have, less, money, and, education, than, whites, they, are, more, likely, to, give, and, receive, help, from, kin, having, family, on, which, one, can, rely, is, very, important, in, times, of, economic, hardship, especially, if, there, are, children, involved, living, in, an, extended, family, provides, constant, care, for, children, and, support, for, other, members, of, the, family, as, well, analysis, of, the, national, survey, of, families, and, households, suggests, there, are, differences, between, whites, and, other, ethnic, groups, because, of, economic, differences, among, racial, groups, blacks, and, latinos, less, often, have, the, economic, resources, that, allow, the, kind, of, privatization, that, the, nuclear, family, entails, extended, kinship, then, is, a, survival, strategy, in, the, face, of, economic, difficulties, being, able, to, rely, on, not, only, two, parents, but, grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, and, sisters, helps, to, create, a, support, system, which, in, turn, brings, families, closer, together, living, in, an, extended, family, provides, many, things, that, a, nuclear, family, does, not, the, number, of, multigenerational, households, has, been, steadily, rising, because, of, the, economic, hardships, people, are, experiencing, today, according, to, the, aarp, multigenerational, households, have, increased, from, 5, million, in, 2000, to, 6, 2, million, in, 2008, there, s, no, question, that, with, some, ethnicities, that, are, growing, in, america, it, is, more, mainstream, and, traditional, to, have, multigenerational, households, we, re, going, to, see, that, increasing, in, the, general, population, as, well, says, aarp, s, ginzler, while, high, unemployment, and, housing, foreclosures, of, the, recession, have, played, a, key, role, in, the, trend, pew, research, center, exec, vp, and, co, author, of, its, multigenerational, household, study, paul, taylor, said, it, has, been, growing, over, several, decades, fueled, by, demographic, and, cultural, shifts, such, as, the, rising, number, of, immigrants, and, the, rising, average, age, of, young, adult, marriages, the, importance, of, an, extended, family, is, one, that, many, people, may, not, realize, but, having, a, support, system, and, many, forms, of, income, may, help, people, today, because, of, the, difficulties, in, finding, a, job, and, bringing, in, enough, money
