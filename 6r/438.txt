to, play, the, four, balls, onto, the, lawn, from, one, of, two, baulk, lines, defined, as, one, yard, into, the, lawn, on, the, western, half, of, the, south, boundary, and, the, eastern, half, of, the, north, boundary, after, this, players, elect, at, the, start, of, each, turn, which, of, their, two, balls, to, play, for, the, duration, of, that, turn, during, a, turn, a, player, may, earn, extra, shots, in, two, ways, a, player, earns, a, single, extra, shot, by, scoring, a, hoop, point, hitting, the, striker, s, ball, through, a, hoop, or, two, extra, shots, by, causing, their, ball, to, contact, another, ball, an, action, called, a, roquet, when, a, roquet, is, made, the, player, may, pick, up, their, ball, and, place, it, in, contact, with, the, roqueted, ball, the, next, shot, must, move, both, the, player, s, ball, and, the, roqueted, ball, and, it, is, the, croquet, stroke, that, gives, the, game, its, name, after, a, successful, croquet, stroke, the, player, has, a, single, further, shot, known, as, the, continuation, during, a, turn, each, of, the, other, three, balls, may, only, be, croqueted, once, between, hoop, points, but, by, stringing, together, a,

called, bisques, are, effective, in, levelling, the, odds, of, winning, golf, croquet, is, played, between, two, individuals, or, teams, each, playing, with, two, balls, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, reach, a, certain, number, of, points, typically, seven, earned, by, being, the, first, to, run, a, hoop, the, game, opens, by, playing, each, ball, into, the, lawn, from, the, fourth, south, eastern, corner, of, the, lawn, balls, must, be, played, in, order, for, the, primary, ball, colours, this, is, blue, red, black, and, yellow, and, this, order, of, play, is, maintained, throughout, the, game, hoops, are, contested, in, a, fixed, order, with, a, point, awarded, to, the, owner, of, the, first, ball, to, pass, through, the, hoop, in, the, correct, direction, after, a, point, is, awarded, all, players, move, on, to, contest, the, next, hoop, balls, that, are, played, more, than, halfway, to, the, next, hoop, before, a, point, is, scored, are, considered, offside, and, are, moved, to, penalty, areas, golf, croquet, is, the, fastest, growing, version, of, the, game, owing, largely, to, its, simplicity, and, competitiveness, there, is, an, especially, large, interest, in, competitive, success, among, players, in, egypt, by, comparison, with, association, croquet, golf, croquet, requires, a, smaller, variety, of, shots, and, emphasises, strategic, skills, and, accurate, shot, making, games, are, shorter, balls, are, more, likely, to, be, hit, harder, and, jump, shots, are, more, likely, to, be, witnessed, where, a, ball, is, played, to, deliberately, jump, off, the, ground, and, over, another, ball, the, american, rules, version, of, croquet, is, the, dominant, version, of, the, game, in, the, united, states, and, is, also, widely, played, in, canada, it, is, governed, by, the, united, states, croquet, association, its, genesis, is, mostly, in, association, croquet, but, it, differs, in, a, number, of, important, ways, that, reflect, the, home, grown, traditions, of, american, backyard, croquet, official, rules, were, first, published, in, 1894, by, the, spalding, athletic, library, as, adopted, by, the, national, american, croquet, association, american, six, wicket, uses, the, same, six, wicket, layout, as, both, association, croquet, and, golf, croquet, and, is, also, played, by, two, individuals, or, teams, each, owning, two, balls, like, association, croquet, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, be, the, first, to, pass, each, of, their, balls, through, all, six, hoops, in, both, directions, and, to, strike, the, central, peg, for, a, total, of, 26, points, unlike, association, croquet, balls, are, always, played, in, the, same, sequence, blue, red, black, yellow, the, limitation, of, roqueting, each, ball, once, between, hoop, points, is, unlike, in, association, croquet, carried, over, from, turn, to, turn, until, the, ball, scores, the, next, hoop, in, american, six, wicket, this, is, termed, deadness, and, a, separate, board, is, required, to, keep, track, of, the, deadness, for, all, four, balls, a, further, difference, is, the, more, restrictive, boundary, line, rules, of, american, croquet, in, the, american, game, roqueting, a, ball, out, of, bounds, or, running, a, hoop, so, that, the, ball, goes, out, of, bounds, causes, the, turn, to, end, and, balls, that, go, out, of, bounds, are, replaced, only, nine, inches, 23, cm, from, the, boundary, rather, than, one, yard, 91, cm, as, in, association, croquet, attacking, balls, on, the, boundary, line, to, bring, them, into, play, is, thus, far, more, challenging, nine, wicket, croquet, sometimes, called, backyard, croquet, is, played, mainly, in, canada, and, the, united, states, and, is, the, game, most, recreational, players, in, those, countries, call, simply, croquet, in, this, version, of, croquet, there, are, nine, wickets, two, stakes, and, up, to, six, balls, the, course, is, arranged, in, a, double, diamond, pattern, with, one, stake, at, each, end, of, the, course, players, start, at, one, stake, navigate, one, side, of, the, double, diamond, hit, the, turning, stake, then, navigate, the, opposite, side, of, the, double, diamond, and, hit, the, starting, stake, to, end, if, playing, individually, cutthroat, the, first, player, to, stake, out, is, the, winner, in, partnership, play, all, members, of, a, team, must, stake, out, and, a, player, might, choose, to, avoid, staking, out, becoming, a, rover, in, order, to, help, a, lagging, teammate, each, time, a, ball, is, roqueted, the, striker, gets, two, bonus, shots, for, the, first, bonus, shot, the, player, has, four, options, the, second, bonus, shot, continuation, shot, is, an, ordinary, shot, played, from, where, the, striker, ball, came, to, rest, an, alternative, endgame, is, poison, in, this, variant, a, player, who, has, scored, the, last, wicket, but, not, hit, the, starting, stake, becomes, a, poison, ball, which, may, eliminate, other, balls, from, the, game, by, roqueting, them, a, non, poison, ball, that, roquets, a, poison, ball, has, the, normal, options, a, poison, ball, that, hits, a, stake, or, passes, through, any, wicket, possibly, through, the, action, of, a, non, poison, player, is, eliminated, the, last, person, remaining, is, the, winner, as, well, as, club, level, games, county, level, tournaments, and, leagues, there, are, regular, world, championships, and, international, matches, between, croquet, playing, countries, the, sport, has, particularly, strong, followings, in, the, uk, us, new, zealand,

croquet, was, an, event, at, the, 1904, summer, olympics, the, oldest, document, to, bear, the, word, croquet, with, a, description, of, the, modern, game, is, the, set, of, rules, registered, by, isaac, spratt, in, november, 1856, with, the, stationers, company, of, london, this, record, is, now, in, the, public, record, office, in, 1868, the, first, croquet, all, comers, meet, was, held, at, moreton, in, marsh, gloucestershire, and, in, the, same, year, the, all, england, croquet, club, was, formed, at, wimbledon, london, regardless, of, when, and, by, what, route, it, reached, the, british, isles, and, the, british, colonies, in, its, recognizable, form, croquet, is, like, pall, mall, and, trucco, among, the, later, forms, of, ground, billiards, which, as, a, class, have, been, popular, in, western, europe, back, to, at, least, the, late, middle, ages, with, roots, in, classical, antiquity, including, sometimes, the, use, of, arches, and, pegs, along, with, balls, and, mallets, or, other, striking, sticks, some, more, akin, to, modern, field, hockey, sticks, by, the, 12th, century, a, team, ball, game, called, la, soule, or, choule, akin, to, a, chaotic, version, of, hockey, or, football, depending, on, whether, sticks, were, used, was, regularly, played, in, france, and, southern, britain, between, villages, or, parishes, it, was, attested, in, cornwall, as, early, as, 1283, in, the, book, queen, of, games, the, history, of, croquet, nicky, smith, presents, two, theories, of, the, origin, of, the, modern, game, of, croquet, which, took, england, by, storm, in, the, 1860s, and, then, spread, overseas, the, first, explanation, is, that, the, ancestral, game, was, introduced, to, britain, from, france, during, the, 1660, 1685, reign, of, charles, ii, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, and, was, played, under, the, name, of, paille, maille, among, other, spellings, today, usually, pall, mall, derived, ultimately, from, latin, words, for, ball, and, mallet, the, latter, also, found, in, the, name, of, the, earlier, french, game, jeu, de, mail, this, was, the, explanation, given, in, the, ninth, edition, of, encyclop, dia, britannica, dated, 1877, in, his, 1801, book, the, sports, and, pastimes, of, the, people, of, england, joseph, strutt, described, the, way, pall, mall, was, played, in, england, at, the, time, pale, maille, is, a, game, wherein, a, round, box, ball, is, struck, with, a, mallet, through, a, high, arch, of, iron, which, he, that, can, do, at, the, fewest, blows, or, at, the, number, agreed, upon, wins, it, is, to, be, observed, that, there, are, two, of, these, arches, that, is, one, at, either, end, of, the, alley, the, game, of, mall, was, a, fashionable, amusement, in, the, reign, of, charles, the, second, and, the, walk, in, saint, james, s, park, now, called, the, mall, received, its, name, from, having, been, appropriated, to, the, purpose, of, playing, at, mall, where, charles, himself, and, his, courtiers, frequently, exercised, themselves, in, the, practice, of, this, pastime, while, the, name, pall, mall, and, various, games, bearing, this, name, also, appeared, elsewhere, france, and, italy, the, description, above, suggests, that, the, croquet, like, games, in, particular, were, popular, in, england, by, the, early, 17th, century, some, other, early, modern, sources, refer, to, pall, mall, being, played, over, a, large, distance, as, in, golf, however, an, image, in, strutt, s, 1801, book, shows, a, croquet, like, ground, billiards, game, balls, on, the, ground, hoop, bats, and, peg, being, played, over, a, short, garden, sized, distance, the, image, s, caption, describes, the, game, as, a, curious, ancient, pastime, confirming, that, croquet, games, were, not, new, in, early, 19th, century, england, in, samuel, johnson, s, 1755, dictionary, his, definition, of, pall, mall, clearly, describes, a, game, with, similarities, to, modern, croquet, a, play, in, which, the, ball, is, struck, with, a, mallet, through, an, iron, ring, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, pall, mall, involved, the, croquet, stroke, which, is, the, distinguishing, characteristic, of, the, modern, game, the, second, theory, is, that, the, rules, of, the, modern, game, of, croquet, arrived, in, ireland, during, the, 1850s, perhaps, after, being, brought, there, from, brittany, where, a, similar, game, was, played, on, the, beaches, regular, contact, between, ireland, and, france, had, continued, since, the, norman, invasion, of, ireland, in, 1169, by, no, later, than, the, early, 15th, century, the, game, jeu, de, mail, itself, ancestral, to, pall, mall, and, perhaps, to, indoor, billiards, was, popular, in, france, including, in, the, courts, of, henry, ii, in, the, 16th, century, and, louis, xiv, of, the, 17th, at, least, one, version, of, it, rou, t, wheel, was, a, multi, ball, lawn, game, records, show, a, game, called, crookey, similar, to, croquet, being, played, at, castlebellingham, in, county, louth, ireland, in, 1834, which, was, introduced, to, galway, in, 1835, and, played, on, the, bishop, s, palace, garden, and, in, the, same, year, to, the, genteel, dublin, suburb, of, kingstown, today, d, n, laoghaire, where, it, was, first, spelled, as, croquet, there, is, however, no, pre, 1858, irish, document, that, describes, the, way, the, game, was, played, in, particular, there, is, no, reference, to, the, distinctive, croquet, stroke, which, is, described, above, under, variations, association, the, noted, croquet, historian, dr, prior, in, his, book, of, 1872, makes, the, categorical, statement, one, thing, only, is, certain, it, is, from, ireland, that, croquet, came, to, england, and, it, was, on, the, lawn, of, the, late, lord, lonsdale, that, it, was, first, played, in, this, country, john, jaques, apparently, claimed, in, a, letter, to, arthur, lillie, in, 1873, that, he, had, himself, seen, the, game, played, in, ireland, writing, i, made, the, implements, and, published, directions, such, as, they, were, before, mr, spratt, introduced, the, subject, to, me, whatever, the, truth, of, the, matter, jaques, certainly, played, an, important, role, in, popularising, the, game, producing, editions, of, the, rules, in, 1857, 1860, and, 1864, croquet, became, highly, popular, as, a, social, pastime, in, england, during, the, 1860s, it, was, enthusiastically, adopted, and, promoted, by, the, earl, of, essex, who, held, lavish, croquet, parties, at, cassiobury, house, his, stately, home, in, watford, hertfordshire, and, the, earl, even, launched, his, own, cassiobury, brand, croquet, set, by, 1867, jaques, had, printed, 65, 000, copies, of, his, laws, and, regulations, of, the, game, it, quickly, spread, to, other, anglophone, countries, including, australia, canada, new, zealand, south, africa, and, the, united, states, no, doubt, one, of, the, attractions, was, that, the, game, could, be, played, by, both, sexes, this, also, ensured, a, certain, amount, of, adverse, comment, it, is, no, coincidence, that, the, game, became, popular, at, the, same, time, as, the, cylinder, lawn, mower, since, croquet, can, only, be, played, well, on, a, lawn, that, is, flat, and, finely, cut, by, the, late, 1870s, however, croquet, had, been, eclipsed, by, another, fashionable, game, lawn, tennis, and, many, of, the, newly, created, croquet, clubs, including, the, all, england, club, at, wimbledon, converted, some, or, all, of, their, lawns, into, tennis, courts, there, was, a, revival, in, the, 1890s, but, from, then, on, croquet, was, always, a, minority, sport, with, national, individual, participation, amounting, to, a, few, thousand, players, the, all, england, lawn, tennis, and, croquet, club, still, has, a, croquet, lawn, but, has, not, hosted, any, significant, tournaments, its, championship, was, won, 38, times, by, bernard, neal, the, english, headquarters, for, the, game, is, now, in, cheltenham, the, earliest, known, reference, to, croquet, in, scotland, is, the, booklet, the, game, of, croquet, its, laws, and, regulations, which, was, published, in, the, mid, 1860s, for, the, proprietor, of, eglinton, castle, the, earl, of, eglinton, on, the, page, facing, the, title, page, is, a, picture, of, eglinton, castle, with, a, game, of, croquet, in, full, swing, the, croquet, lawn, existed, on, the, northern, terrace, between, eglinton, castle, and, the, lugton, water, the, 13th, earl, developed, a, variation, on, croquet, named, captain, moreton, s, eglinton, castle, croquet, which, had, small, bells, on, the, eight, hoops, to, ring, the, changes, two, pegs, a, double, hoop, with, a, bell, and, two, tunnels, for, the, ball, to, pass, through, in, 1865, the, rules, of, the, eglinton, castle, and, cassiobury, croquet, was, published, by, edmund, routledge, several, incomplete, sets, of, this, form, of, croquet, are, known, to, exist, and, one, complete, set, is, still, used, for, demonstration, games, in, the, west, of, scotland, croquet, is, popularly, believed, to, be, viciously, competitive, this, may, derive, from, the, fact, that, unlike, in, golf, players, will, often, attempt, to, move, their, opponents, balls, to, unfavourable, positions, however, purely, negative, play, is, rarely, a, winning, strategy, successful, players, in, all, versions, other, than, golf, croquet, will, use, all, four, balls, to, set, up, a, break, for, themselves, rather, than, simply, making, the, game, as, difficult, as, possible, for, their, opponents, the, way, croquet, is, depicted, in, paintings, and, books, says, much, about, popular, perceptions, of, the, game, though, little, about, the, reality, of, modern, play, about, 200, croquet, clubs, across, the, united, states, are, members, of, the, united, states, croquet, association, many, colleges, have, croquet, clubs, as, well, such, as, the, university, of, virginia, the, university, of, chicago, pennsylvania, state, university, bates, college, suny, new, paltz, harvard, university, and, dartmouth, college, notably, st, john, s, college, and, the, us, naval, academy, engage, in, a, yearly, match, in, annapolis, maryland, both, schools, also, compete, at, the, collegiate, level, and, the, rivalry, continues, to, be, an, annapolis, tradition, attracting, thousands, of, spectators, each, april, in, england, and, wales, there, are, around, 170, clubs, affiliated, with, the, croquet, association, the, all, england, lawn, tennis, and, croquet, club, at, wimbledon, is, famous, for, its, lawn, tennis, tournament, but, retains, an, active, croquet, section, there, are, also, clubs, in, many, universities, and, colleges, with, an, annual, varsity, match, being, played, between, oxford, and, cambridge, with, over, 1800, participants, the, 2011, oxford, university, cuppers, inter, college, tournament, claimed, to, be, not, only, the, largest, croquet, tournament, ever, but, the, largest, sporting, event, in, the, university, s, history, there, are, 112, clubs, in, new, zealand, affiliated, with, 19, associations, these, are, governed, by, croquet,
