a, moustache, uk, m, s, t, american, english, mustache, m, s, t, is, a, growth, of, facial, hair, grown, above, the, upper, lip, and, under, the, nose, moustaches, have, been, worn, in, various, styles, throughout, history, the, word, moustache, is, french, and, is, derived, from, the, italian, mustaccio, 14th, century, dialectal, mostaccio, 16th, century, from, medieval, latin, mustacchium, eighth, century, medieval, greek, moustakion, attested, in, the, ninth, century, which, ultimately, originates, as, a, diminutive, of, hellenistic, greek, mustax, mustak, meaning, upper, lip, or, facial, hair, probably, derived, from, hellenistic, greek, mullon, lip, an, individual, wearing, a, moustache, is, said, to, be, moustached, or, moustachioed, the, latter, often, referring, to, a, particularly, large, or, bushy, moustache, research, done, on, this, subject, has, noticed, that, the, prevalence, of, moustaches, and, facial, hair, in, general, rise, and, fall, according, to, the, saturation, of, the, marriage, market, thus, the, density, and, thickness, of, the, moustache, or, beard, may, help, to, convey, androgen, levels, or, age, earliest, depictions, of, moustache, trace, back, to, ancient, egypt, old, kingdom, era, ca, 2649, 2130, b, c, on, the, left, statue, of, prince, rahotep, wearing, a, moustache, 27th, century, bc, on, the, right, hesy, ra, wearing, a, moustache, 27th, century, bc, one, of, the, earliest, documents, of, the, usage, of, moustaches, without, the, beard, can, be, traced, to, iron, age, celts, according, to, diodorus, siculus, a, greek, historian, the, gauls, are, tall, of, body, with, rippling, muscles, and, white, of, skin, and, their, hair, is, blond, and, not, only, naturally, so, for, they, also, make, it, their, practice, by, artificial, means, to, increase, the, distinguishing, colour, which, nature, has, given, it, for, they, are, always, washing, their, hair, in, limewater, and, they, pull, it, back, from, the, forehead, to, the, nape, of, the, neck, with, the, result, that, their, appearance, is, like, that, of, satyrs, and, pans, since, the, treatment, of, their, hair, makes, it, so, heavy, and, coarse, that, it, differs, in, no, respect, from, the, mane, of, horses, some, of, them, shave, the, beard, but, others, let, it, grow, a, little, and, the, nobles, shave, their, cheeks, but, they, let, the, moustache, grow, until, it, covers, the, mouth, moustaches, would, not, go, away, during, the, middle, ages, one, prominent, example, of, the, moustache, in, early, medieval, art, is, the, sutton, hoo, helmet, an, elaborately, decorated, helmet, sporting, a, faceplate, depicting, the, style, on, its, upper, lip, later, on, welsh, leaders, and, english, royalty, such, as, edward, of, wales, would, also, often, wear, only, a, moustache, moustache, popularity, in, the, west, peaked, in, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, coinciding, with, a, popularity, in, the, military, virtues, of, the, day, various, cultures, have, developed, different, associations, with, moustaches, for, example, in, many, 20th, century, arab, countries, moustaches, are, associated, with, power, beards, are, associated, with, islamic, traditionalism, and, clean, shaven, or, lack, of, facial, hair, are, associated, with, more, liberal, secular, tendencies, in, islam, trimming, the, moustache, is, considered, to, be, a, sunnah, and, mustahabb, that, is, a, way, of, life, that, is, recommended, especially, among, sunni, muslims, the, moustache, is, also, a, religious, symbol, for, the, male, followers, of, the, yarsan, religion, shaving, with, stone, razors, was, technologically, possible, from, as, far, back, as, the, neolithic, times, a, moustache, is, depicted, on, a, statue, of, the, 4th, dynasty, egyptian, prince, rahotep, c, 2550, bc, another, ancient, portrait, showing, a, shaved, man, with, a, moustache, is, an, ancient, iranian, scythian, horseman, from, 300, bc, in, ancient, china, facial, hair, and, the, hair, on, the, head, were, traditionally, left, untouched, because, of, confucian, influences, the, moustache, forms, its, own, stage, in, the, development, of, facial, hair, in, adolescent, males, as, with, most, human, biological, processes, this, specific, order, may, vary, among, some, individuals, depending, on, one, s, genetic, heritage, or, environment, moustaches, can, be, tended, through, shaving, the, hair, of, the, chin, and, cheeks, preventing, it, from, becoming, a, full, beard, a, variety, of, tools, have, been, developed, for, the, care, of, moustaches, including, safety, razors, moustache, wax, moustache, nets, moustache, brushes, moustache, combs, and, moustache, scissors, in, the, middle, east, there, is, a, growing, trend, for, moustache, transplants, which, involves, undergoing, a, procedure, called, follicular, unit, extraction, in, order, to, attain, fuller, and, more, impressive, facial, hair, the, longest, moustache, measures, 4, 29, metres, 14, 1, ft, and, belongs, to, ram, singh, chauhan, from, india, it, was, measured, on, the, set, of, the, italian, tv, show, lo, show, dei, record, in, rome, italy, on, 4, march, 2010, the, world, beard, and, moustache, championships, 2007, had, six, sub, categories, for, moustaches, other, types, of, moustache, include, like, many, other, fashion, trends, the, moustache, is, subject, to, shifting, popularity, through, time, though, modern, culture, often, associates, moustaches, with, men, of, the, victorian, era, susan, walton, shows, that, at, the, start, of, the, victorian, era, facial, hair, was, viewed, with, distaste, and, that, the, moustache, was, considered, the, mark, of, an, artist, or, revolutionary, both, of, which, remained, on, the, social, fringe, at, the, time, this, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, only, one, member, of, parliament, sported, facial, hair, from, the, years, 1841, 1847, however, by, the, 1860s, this, had, changed, and, moustaches, became, wildly, popular, even, among, distinguished, men, but, by, the, end, of, the, century, facial, hair, became, pass, once, more, though, one, cannot, be, entirely, sure, as, to, the, cause, of, such, changes, walton, speculates, that, the, rise, of, the, facial, hair, trend, was, due, largely, in, part, to, the, impending, war, against, russia, and, the, belief, that, moustaches, and, beards, projected, a, more, manly, image, which, was, brought, about, by, the, so, called, rebranding, of, the, british, military, and, the, rehabilitation, of, military, virtues, moustaches, became, a, defining, trait, of, the, british, soldier, and, until, 1916, no, enlisted, soldier, was, permitted, to, shave, his, upper, lip, however, the, next, generation, of, men, perceived, facial, hair, such, as, moustaches, to, be, an, outdated, emblem, of, masculinity, and, therefore, there, was, a, dramatic, decline, in, the, moustache, trend, and, a, clean, shaven, face, became, the, mark, of, a, modern, man, according, to, a, study, performed, by, nigel, barber, results, have, shown, a, strong, correlation, between, a, good, marriage, market, for, women, and, an, increased, number, of, moustaches, worn, by, the, male, population, by, comparing, the, number, of, males, pictured, in, illustrated, london, news, sporting, a, moustache, against, the, ratio, of, single, women, to, single, men, the, similar, trends, in, the, two, over, the, years, would, suggest, that, these, two, factors, are, correlated, barber, suggests, that, this, correlation, may, be, due, to, the, fact, that, men, with, moustaches, are, perceived, to, be, more, attractive, industrious, creative, masculine, dominant, and, mature, by, both, men, and, women, as, supported, by, the, research, conducted, by, hellstr, m, and, tekle, barber, suggests, that, these, perceived, traits, would, influence, a, woman, s, choice, of, husband, as, they, would, suggest, likely, high, reproductive, success, and, other, good, biological, qualities, and, a, capacity, to, invest, in, children, so, when, males, must, compete, heavily, for, marriage, they, are, more, likely, to, grow, a, moustache, in, an, attempt, to, project, these, qualities, this, theory, is, also, supported, by, the, correlation, between, beard, fashion, and, women, wearing, long, dresses, as, shown, by, robinson, s, study, which, then, relates, to, the, correlation, between, dress, fashion, and, the, marriage, market, as, shown, in, barber, s, 1999, study, the, moustache, and, other, forms, of, facial, hair, are, globally, understood, to, be, signs, of, the, post, pubescent, male, however, those, with, moustaches, are, perceived, to, be, older, than, those, who, are, clean, shaven, of, the, same, age, this, was, determined, by, manipulating, a, photo, of, six, male, subjects, with, varying, levels, of, baldness, to, have, moustaches, and, beards, and, then, asking, undergraduate, college, students, to, rate, both, the, photos, of, the, men, with, facial, hair, and, without, facial, hair, in, terms, of, social, maturity, aggression, age, appeasement, and, attractiveness, regardless, of, how, bald, the, subject, was, the, results, found, in, relation, to, the, perception, of, moustaches, remained, constant, although, males, with, facial, hair, were, perceived, in, general, to, be, older, than, the, same, subject, pictured, without, facial, hair, the, moustached, subjects, were, also, perceived, to, be, far, less, socially, mature, the, decreased, perception, of, social, maturity, of, the, men, with, moustaches, may, partially, be, due, to, the, increase, in, the, perception, of, aggression, in, the, moustachioed, men, as, aggression, is, incompatible, with, social, maturity, in, a, study, performed, by, j, a, reed, and, e, m, blunk, persons, in, management, positions, were, shown, to, positively, perceive, and, therefore, be, more, likely, to, hire, men, with, facial, hair, although, men, with, beards, over, all, scored, better, than, men, with, only, moustaches, the, moustached, men, scored, much, higher, than, those, men, who, were, clean, shaven, in, this, experiment, 228, people, both, male, and, female, who, held, management, positions, that, made, hiring, decisions, were, shown, ink, sketches, of, six, male, job, applicants, the, men, in, these, ink, sketches, ranged, from, clean, shaven, to, moustachioed, to, bearded, the, men, with, facial, hair, were, rated, higher, by, the, employers, on, aspects, of, masculinity, maturity, physical, attractiveness, dominance, self, confidence, nonconformity, courage, industriousness, enthusiasm, intelligence, sincerity, and, general, competency, the, results, were, found, to, be, fairly, similar, for, both, female, and, male, employers, which, reed, and, blunk, suggest, would, imply, that, gender, does, not, factor, into, one, s, perceptions, of, a, moustache, on, a, male, applicant, however, blunk, and, reed, also, stipulate, that, the, meaning, and, acceptability, of, facial, hair, does, change, depending, on, the, time, period, however, the, studies, performed, by, hellstr, m, and, tekle, and, also, the, studies, performed, by, klapprott, would, suggest, that, moustaches, are, not, favourable, to, all, professions, as, it, has, been, shown, that, clean, shaven, men, are, seen, as, more, reliable, in, roles, such, as, salesmen, and, professors, other, studies, have, suggested, that, acceptability, of, facial, hair, may, vary, depending, on, culture, and, location, as, in, a, study, conducted, in, brazil, clean, shaven, men, were, preferred, by, personnel, managers, over, applicants, who, were, bearded, goateed, or, moustached, in, western, culture, it, has, been, shown, that, women, dislike, men, who, displayed, a, visible, moustache, or, beard, but, preferred, men, who, had, a, visible, hint, of, a, beard, such, as, stubble, often, known, as, a, five, o, clock, shadow, over, those, who, were, clean, shaven, this, supports, the, idea, that, in, western, culture, females, prefer, men, who, have, the, capability, to, cultivate, facial, hair, such, as, a, moustache, but, choose, not, to, however, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, it, is, possible, that, in, ecologies, in, which, physical, aggressiveness, is, more, adaptive, than, cooperation, bearded, men, might, be, preferred, by, women, however, varying, opinion, on, moustaches, is, not, reserved, to, international, cultural, differences, as, even, within, the, us, there, have, been, discrepancies, observed, on, female, preference, of, male, facial, hair, as, freedman, s, study, suggested, that, women, studying, at, the, university, of, chicago, preferred, men, with, facial, hair, because, they, perceived, them, to, be, more, masculine, sophisticated, and, mature, than, clean, shaven, men, similarly, a, study, performed, by, kenny, and, fletcher, at, memphis, state, university, suggested, that, men, with, facial, hair, such, as, moustaches, and, beards, were, perceived, as, stronger, and, more, masculine, by, female, students, however, the, study, performed, by, feinman, and, gill, would, suggest, that, this, reaction, to, facial, hair, is, not, nationwide, as, women, studying, in, the, state, of, wyoming, showed, a, marked, preference, for, clean, shaven, men, over, men, with, facial, hair, some, accredit, this, difference, to, the, difference, between, region, rurality, and, political, and, social, conservatism, between, the, various, studies, thus, it, can, be, seen, that, even, within, the, us, there, are, slight, variations, in, the, perceptions, of, moustaches, in, addition, to, various, cultures, the, perception, of, the, moustache, is, also, altered, by, religion, as, some, religions, support, the, growth, of, a, moustache, or, facial, hair, in, general, whereas, others, tend, to, reject, those, with, moustaches, while, many, churches, remain, somewhat, ambivalent, on, the, subject, while, amish, men, grow, beards, after, marriage, and, never, trim, them, they, eschew, moustaches, and, continue, shaving, their, upper, lips, this, is, rooted, in, a, rejection, of, the, german, military, fashion, of, sporting, moustaches, which, was, prevalent, at, the, time, of, the, amish, community, s, formation, in, switzerland, hence, serving, as, a, symbol, of, their, commitment, to, pacifism, though, it, is, never, explicitly, stated, by, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, that, all, male, members, must, be, clean, shaven, within, latter, day, saint, circles, it, is, often, considered, taboo, for, men, to, have, moustaches, as, the, missionaries, of, the, church, are, required, to, be, clean, shaven, as, well, as, the, honor, code, of, brigham, young, university, requiring, students, to, have, similar, grooming, standards, this, has, become, somewhat, of, a, social, norm, within, the, church, itself, this, often, leads, those, members, who, do, choose, to, wear, moustaches, feel, somewhat, like, they, do, not, quite, fit, the, norm, and, yet, in, the, studies, shown, done, by, nielsen, and, white, these, men, reportedly, do, not, mind, this, feeling, and, that, is, why, they, continue, to, grow, their, facial, hair, even, though, facial, grooming, is, not, specifically, mentioned, within, the, qur, an, numerous, narrations, of, hadith, sayings, of, muhammad, address, personal, hygiene, including, facial, hair, maintenance, in, one, such, example, muhammad, advised, that, men, must, grow, beards, and, as, to, moustaches, cut, the, longer, hairs, as, to, not, let, them, cover, the, upper, lips, as, this, is, the, fitra, the, tradition, of, prophets, thus, growing, a, beard, while, keeping, the, moustache, from, covering, the, upper, lip, is, a, well, established, tradition, in, many, muslim, societies, the, longest, moustache, measures, 4, 29, metres, 14, 1, ft, and, belongs, to, ram, singh, chauhan, of, india, it, was, measured, on, the, set, of, lo, show, dei, record, in, rome, italy, on, 4, march, 2010, in, some, cases, the, moustache, is, so, prominently, identified, with, a, single, individual, that, it, could, identify, him, without, any, further, identifying, traits, for, example, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, s, moustache, grossly, exaggerated, featured, prominently, in, triple, entente, propaganda, other, notable, individuals, include, adolf, hitler, joseph, stalin, saddam, hussein, hulk, hogan, don, frye, dan, severn, freddie, mercury, salvador, dal, frank, zappa, sam, elliott, tom, selleck, burt, reynolds, borat, and, steve, harvey, in, other, cases, such, as, those, of, charlie, chaplin, and, groucho, marx, the, moustache, in, question, was, artificial, for, most, of, the, wearer, s, life, following, a, moped, accident, that, left, him, with, a, scar, on, his, upper, lip, paul, mccartney, decided, to, grow, a, moustache, in, order, to, hide, it, the, other, members, of, the, beatles, decided, to, do, the, same, they, were, first, seen, with, this, new, look, on, the, cover, of, their, 1967, album, sgt, pepper, s, lonely, hearts, club, band, this, marked, the, return, of, young, men, wearing, moustaches, in, the, 1960s, they, have, also, been, used, to, make, a, social, or, political, point, as, with
