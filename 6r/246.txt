the, combined, oral, contraceptive, pill, cocp, often, referred, to, as, the, birth, control, pill, or, colloquially, as, the, pill, is, a, type, of, birth, control, that, is, designed, to, be, taken, orally, by, women, it, is, the, oral, form, of, combined, hormonal, contraception, the, pill, contains, two, important, hormones, a, progestin, a, synthetic, form, of, the, hormone, progestogen, progesterone, and, estrogen, usually, ethinylestradiol, or, 17, estradiol, when, taken, correctly, it, alters, the, menstrual, cycle, to, eliminate, ovulation, and, prevent, pregnancy, cocps, were, first, approved, for, contraceptive, use, in, the, united, states, in, 1960, and, remain, a, very, popular, form, of, birth, control, they, are, used, by, more, than, 100, million, women, worldwide, including, about, 9, million, women, in, the, united, states, from, 2015, to, 2017, 12, 6, of, women, aged, 15, 49, in, the, us, reported, using, cocps, making, it, the, second, most, common, method, of, contraception, in, this, age, range, female, sterilization, is, the, most, common, method, use, of, cocps, however, varies, widely, by, country, age, education, and, marital, status, for, example, one, third, of, women, aged, 16, 49, in, the, united, kingdom, use, either, the, combined, pill, or, progestogen, only, pill, pop, compared, with, less, than, 3, of, women, in, japan, as, of, 1950, 2014, combined, oral, contraceptives, are, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, the, pill, was, a, catalyst, for, the, sexual, revolution, combined, oral, contraceptive, pills, were, developed, to, prevent, ovulation, by, suppressing, the, release, of, gonadotropins, combined, hormonal, contraceptives, including, cocps, inhibit, follicular, development, and, prevent, ovulation, as, a, primary, mechanism, of, action, under, normal, circumstances, luteinizing, hormone, lh, stimulates, the, theca, cells, of, the, ovarian, follicle, to, produce, androstenedione, the, granulosa, cells, of, the, ovarian, follicle, then, convert, this, androstenedione, to, estradiol, this, conversion, process, is, catalyzed, by, aromatase, an, enzyme, produced, as, a, result, of, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, stimulation, in, individuals, using, oral, contraceptives, progestogen, negative, feedback, decreases, the, pulse, frequency, of, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, gnrh, release, by, the, hypothalamus, which, decreases, the, secretion, of, fsh, and, greatly, decreases, the, secretion, of, lh, by, the, anterior, pituitary, decreased, levels, of, fsh, inhibit, follicular, development, preventing, an, increase, in, estradiol, levels, progestogen, negative, feedback, and, the, lack, of, estrogen, positive, feedback, on, lh, secretion, prevent, a, mid, cycle, lh, surge, inhibition, of, follicular, development, and, the, absence, of, an, lh, surge, prevent, ovulation, estrogen, was, originally, included, in, oral, contraceptives, for, better, cycle, control, to, stabilize, the, endometrium, and, thereby, reduce, the, incidence, of, breakthrough, bleeding, but, was, also, found, to, inhibit, follicular, development, and, help, prevent, ovulation, estrogen, negative, feedback, on, the, anterior, pituitary, greatly, decreases, the, secretion, of, fsh, which, inhibits, follicular, development, and, helps, prevent, ovulation, another, primary, mechanism, of, action, of, all, progestogen, containing, contraceptives, is, inhibition, of, sperm, penetration, through, the, cervix, into, the, upper, genital, tract, uterus, and, fallopian, tubes, by, decreasing, the, water, content, and, increasing, the, viscosity, of, the, cervical, mucus, the, estrogen, and, progestogen, in, cocps, have, other, effects, on, the, reproductive, system, but, these, have, not, been, shown, to, contribute, to, their, contraceptive, efficacy, insufficient, evidence, exists, on, whether, changes, in, the, endometrium, could, actually, prevent, implantation, the, primary, mechanisms, of, action, are, so, effective, that, the, possibility, of, fertilization, during, cocp, use, is, very, small, since, pregnancy, occurs, despite, endometrial, changes, when, the, primary, mechanisms, of, action, fail, endometrial, changes, are, unlikely, to, play, a, significant, role, if, any, in, the, observed, effectiveness, of, cocps, oral, contraceptives, come, in, a, variety, of, formulations, some, containing, both, estrogen, and, progestins, and, some, only, containing, progestin, doses, of, component, hormones, also, vary, among, products, and, some, pills, are, monophasic, delivering, the, same, dose, of, hormones, each, day, while, others, are, multiphasic, doses, vary, each, day, cocps, can, also, be, divided, into, two, groups, those, with, progestins, that, possess, androgen, activity, norethisterone, acetate, etynodiol, diacetate, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestimate, desogestrel, gestodene, or, antiandrogen, activity, cyproterone, acetate, chlormadinone, acetate, drospirenone, dienogest, nomegestrol, acetate, cocps, have, been, somewhat, inconsistently, grouped, into, generations, in, the, medical, literature, based, on, when, they, were, introduced, combined, oral, contraceptive, pills, are, a, type, of, oral, medication, that, were, originally, designed, to, be, taken, every, day, at, the, same, time, of, day, in, order, to, prevent, pregnancy, there, are, many, different, formulations, or, brands, but, the, average, pack, is, designed, to, be, taken, over, a, 28, day, period, also, known, as, a, cycle, for, the, first, 21, days, of, the, cycle, users, take, a, daily, pill, that, contains, two, hormones, estrogen, and, progestogen, during, the, last, 7, days, of, the, cycle, users, take, daily, placebo, biologically, inactive, pills, and, these, days, are, considered, hormone, free, days, although, these, are, hormone, free, days, users, are, still, protected, from, pregnancy, during, this, time, some, cocp, packs, only, contain, 21, pills, and, users, are, advised, to, take, no, pills, for, the, last, 7, days, of, the, cycle, other, cocp, formulations, contain, 91, pills, consisting, of, 84, days, of, active, hormones, followed, by, 7, days, of, placebo, seasonale, cocp, formulations, can, contain, 24, days, of, active, hormone, pills, followed, by, 4, days, of, placebo, pills, e, g, yaz, 28, and, loestrin, 24, fe, as, a, means, to, decrease, the, severity, of, placebo, effects, these, cocps, containing, active, hormones, and, a, placebo, hormone, free, period, are, called, cyclic, cocps, once, a, pack, of, cyclical, cocp, treatment, is, completed, users, start, a, new, pack, and, new, cycle, most, monophasic, cocps, can, be, used, continuously, such, that, patients, can, skip, placebo, days, and, continuously, take, hormone, active, pills, from, a, cocp, pack, one, of, the, most, common, reasons, users, do, this, is, to, avoid, or, diminish, withdrawal, bleeding, the, majority, of, women, on, cyclic, cocps, have, regularly, scheduled, withdrawal, bleeding, which, is, vaginal, bleeding, mimicking, users, menstrual, cycles, with, the, exception, of, lighter, menstrual, bleeding, compared, to, bleeding, patterns, prior, to, cocp, commencement, as, such, a, study, reported, that, out, of, 1003, women, taking, cocps, approximately, 90, reported, regularly, scheduled, withdrawal, bleeds, over, a, 90, day, standard, reference, period, withdrawal, bleeding, usually, occurs, during, the, placebo, hormone, free, days, therefore, avoiding, placebo, days, can, diminish, withdrawal, bleeding, among, other, placebo, effects, if, used, exactly, as, instructed, the, estimated, risk, of, getting, pregnant, is, 0, 3, which, means, that, about, 3, in, 1000, women, on, cocps, will, become, pregnant, within, one, year, however, typical, use, of, cocps, by, users, often, consists, of, timing, errors, forgotten, pills, or, unwanted, side, effects, with, typical, use, the, estimated, risk, of, getting, pregnant, is, about, 9, which, means, that, about, 9, in, 100, women, on, cocps, will, become, pregnant, in, one, year, the, perfect, use, failure, rate, is, based, on, a, review, of, pregnancy, rates, in, clinical, trials, and, the, typical, use, failure, rate, is, based, on, a, weighted, average, of, estimates, from, the, 1995, and, 2002, us, national, surveys, of, family, growth, nsfg, corrected, for, underreporting, of, abortions, several, factors, account, for, typical, use, effectiveness, being, lower, than, perfect, use, effectiveness, for, instance, someone, using, cocps, might, have, received, incorrect, information, by, a, health, care, provider, about, medication, frequency, forgotten, to, take, the, pill, one, day, or, not, gone, to, the, pharmacy, in, time, to, renew, her, cocp, prescription, cocps, provide, effective, contraception, from, the, very, first, pill, if, started, within, five, days, of, the, beginning, of, the, menstrual, cycle, within, five, days, of, the, first, day, of, menstruation, if, started, at, any, other, time, in, the, menstrual, cycle, cocps, provide, effective, contraception, only, after, 7, consecutive, days, of, use, of, active, pills, so, a, backup, method, of, contraception, e, g, condoms, must, be, used, in, the, interim, the, effectiveness, of, cocps, appears, to, be, similar, whether, the, active, pills, are, taken, continuously, or, if, they, are, taken, cyclically, contraceptive, efficacy, however, could, be, impaired, by, numerous, means, factors, that, may, contribute, to, a, decrease, in, effectiveness, in, any, of, these, instances, a, backup, contraceptive, method, should, be, used, until, hormone, active, pills, have, been, consistently, taken, for, 7, consecutive, days, or, drug, drug, interactions, or, underlying, illnesses, have, been, discontinued, or, resolved, according, to, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, guidelines, a, pill, is, considered, late, if, a, user, takes, the, pill, after, the, user, s, normal, medication, time, but, no, longer, than, 24, hours, after, this, normal, time, if, 24, hours, or, more, have, passed, since, the, time, the, user, was, supposed, to, take, the, pill, then, the, pill, is, considered, missed, cdc, guidelines, discuss, potential, next, steps, for, users, who, missed, their, pill, or, took, it, late, the, role, of, the, placebo, pills, is, two, fold, to, allow, the, user, to, continue, the, routine, of, taking, a, pill, every, day, and, to, simulate, the, average, menstrual, cycle, by, continuing, to, take, a, pill, every, day, users, remain, in, the, daily, habit, even, during, the, week, without, hormones, failure, to, take, pills, during, the, placebo, week, does, not, impact, the, effectiveness, of, the, pill, provided, that, daily, ingestion, of, active, pills, is, resumed, at, the, end, of, the, week, the, placebo, or, hormone, free, week, in, the, 28, day, pill, package, simulates, an, average, menstrual, cycle, though, the, hormonal, events, during, a, pill, cycle, are, significantly, different, from, those, of, a, normal, ovulatory, menstrual, cycle, because, the, pill, suppresses, ovulation, to, be, discussed, more, in, the, mechanism, of, action, section, birth, control, users, do, not, have, true, menstrual, periods, instead, it, is, the, lack, of, hormones, for, a, week, that, causes, a, withdrawal, bleed, the, withdrawal, bleeding, that, occurs, during, the, break, from, active, pills, has, been, thought, to, be, reassuring, a, physical, confirmation, of, not, being, pregnant, the, withdrawal, bleeding, is, also, predictable, unexpected, breakthrough, bleeding, can, be, a, possible, side, effect, of, longer, term, active, regimens, since, it, is, not, uncommon, for, menstruating, women, to, become, anemic, some, placebo, pills, may, contain, an, iron, supplement, this, replenishes, iron, stores, that, may, become, depleted, during, menstruation, as, well, birth, control, pills, such, as, cocps, are, sometimes, fortified, with, folic, acid, as, it, is, recommended, to, take, folic, acid, supplementation, in, the, months, prior, to, pregnancy, to, decrease, the, likelihood, of, neural, tube, defect, in, infants, if, the, pill, formulation, is, monophasic, meaning, each, hormonal, pill, contains, a, fixed, dose, of, hormones, it, is, possible, to, skip, withdrawal, bleeding, and, still, remain, protected, against, conception, by, skipping, the, placebo, pills, altogether, and, starting, directly, with, the, next, packet, attempting, this, with, bi, or, tri, phasic, pill, formulations, carries, an, increased, risk, of, breakthrough, bleeding, and, may, be, undesirable, it, will, not, however, increase, the, risk, of, getting, pregnant, starting, in, 2003, women, have, also, been, able, to, use, a, three, month, version, of, the, pill, similar, to, the, effect, of, using, a, constant, dosage, formulation, and, skipping, the, placebo, weeks, for, three, months, seasonale, gives, the, benefit, of, less, frequent, periods, at, the, potential, drawback, of, breakthrough, bleeding, seasonique, is, another, version, in, which, the, placebo, week, every, three, months, is, replaced, with, a, week, of, low, dose, estrogen, a, version, of, the, combined, pill, has, also, been, packaged, to, eliminate, placebo, pills, and, withdrawal, bleeds, marketed, as, anya, or, lybrel, studies, have, shown, that, after, seven, months, 71, of, users, no, longer, had, any, breakthrough, bleeding, the, most, common, side, effect, of, going, longer, periods, of, time, without, breaks, from, active, pills, while, more, research, needs, to, be, done, to, assess, the, long, term, safety, of, using, cocp, s, continuously, studies, have, shown, there, may, be, no, difference, in, short, term, adverse, effects, when, comparing, continuous, use, versus, cyclic, use, of, birth, control, pills, the, hormones, in, the, pill, have, also, been, used, to, treat, other, medical, conditions, such, as, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, pcos, endometriosis, adenomyosis, acne, hirsutism, amenorrhea, menstrual, cramps, menstrual, migraines, menorrhagia, excessive, menstrual, bleeding, menstruation, related, or, fibroid, related, anemia, and, dysmenorrhea, painful, menstruation, besides, acne, no, oral, contraceptives, have, been, approved, by, the, us, fda, for, the, previously, mentioned, uses, despite, extensive, use, for, these, conditions, the, cause, of, pcos, or, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, is, multifactorial, and, not, well, understood, women, with, pcos, often, have, higher, than, normal, levels, of, luteinizing, hormone, lh, and, androgens, that, impact, the, normal, function, of, the, ovaries, while, multiple, small, follicles, develop, in, the, ovary, none, are, able, to, grow, in, size, enough, to, become, the, dominant, follicle, and, trigger, ovulation, this, leads, to, an, imbalance, of, lh, follicle, stimulating, hormone, estrogen, and, progesterone, without, ovulation, unopposed, estrogen, can, lead, to, endometrial, hyperplasia, or, overgrowth, of, tissue, in, the, uterus, this, endometrial, overgrowth, is, more, likely, to, become, cancerous, than, normal, endometrial, tissue, thus, although, the, data, varies, it, is, generally, agreed, upon, by, most, gynecological, societies, that, due, to, the, unopposed, estrogen, women, with, pcos, are, at, higher, risk, for, endometrial, cancer, to, reduce, the, risk, of, endometrial, cancer, it, is, often, recommended, that, women, with, pcos, who, do, not, desire, pregnancy, take, hormonal, contraceptives, to, prevent, the, effects, of, unopposed, estrogen, both, cocps, and, progestin, only, methods, are, recommended, it, is, the, progestin, component, of, cocps, that, protects, the, endometrium, from, hyperplasia, and, thus, reduces, a, woman, with, pcos, s, endometrial, cancer, risk, cocps, are, preferred, to, progestin, only, methods, in, women, who, also, have, uncontrolled, acne, symptoms, of, hirsutism, and, androgenic, alopecia, because, cocps, can, help, treat, these, symptoms, cocps, are, sometimes, prescribed, to, treat, symptoms, of, androgenization, including, acne, and, hirsutism, the, estrogen, component, of, cocps, appears, to, suppress, androgen, production, in, the, ovaries, estrogen, also, leads, to, increased, synthesis, of, sex, hormone, binding, globulin, which, causes, a, decrease, in, the, levels, of, free, testosterone, ultimately, the, drop, in, the, level, of, free, androgens, leads, to, a, decrease, in, the, production, of, sebum, which, is, a, major, contributor, to, development, of, acne, four, different, oral, contraceptives, have, been, fda, approved, to, treat, moderate, acne, if, the, patient, is, at, least, 14, or, 15, years, old, has, already, begun, menstruating, and, needs, contraception, these, include, ortho, tri, cyclen, estrostep, beyaz, and, yaz, hirsutism, is, the, growth, of, coarse, dark, hair, where, women, typically, grow, only, fine, hair, or, no, hair, at, all, this, hair, growth, on, the, face, chest, and, abdomen, is, also, mediated, by, higher, levels, or, action, of, androgens, therefore, cocps, also, work, to, treat, these, symptoms, by, lowering, the, levels, of, free, circulating, androgens, for, pelvic, pain, associated, with, endometriosis, cocps, are, considered, a, first, line, medical, treatment, along, with, nsaids, gnrh, agonists, and, aromatase, inhibitors, cocps, work, to, suppress, the, growth, of, the, extra, uterine, endometrial, tissue, this, works, to, lessen, its, inflammatory, effects, cocps, along, with, the, other, medical, treatments, listed, above, do, not, eliminate, the, extra, uterine, tissue, growth, they, just, reduce, the, symptoms, surgery, is, the, only, definitive, treatment, studies, looking, at, rates, of, pelvic, pain, recurrence, after, surgery, have, shown, that, continuous, use, of, cocps, is, more, effective, at, reducing, the, recurrence, of, pain, than, cyclic, use, similar, to, endometriosis, adenomyosis, is, often, treated, with, cocps, to, suppress, the, growth, the, endometrial, tissue, that, has, grown, into, the, myometrium, unlike, endometriosis, however, levonorgestrel, containing, iuds, are, more, effective, at, reducing, pelvic, pain, in, adenomyosis, than, cocps, in, the, average, menstrual, cycle, a, woman, typically, loses, 35, to, 40, milliliters, of, blood, however, up, to, 20, of, women, experience, much, heavier, bleeding, or, menorrhagia, this, excess, blood, loss, can, lead, to, anemia, with, symptoms, of, fatigue, and, weakness, as, well, as, disruption, in, their, normal, life, activities, cocps, contain, progestin, which, causes, the, lining, of, the, uterus, to, be, thinner, resulting, in, lighter, bleeding, episodes, for, those, with, heavy, menstrual, bleeding, although, the, pill, is, sometimes, prescribed, to, induce, menstruation, on, a, regular, schedule, for, women, bothered, by, irregular, menstrual, cycles, it, actually, suppresses, the, normal, menstrual, cycle, and, then, mimics, a, regular, 28, day, monthly, cycle, women, who, are, experiencing, menstrual, dysfunction, due, to, female, athlete, triad, are, sometimes, prescribed, oral, contraceptives, as, pills, that, can, create, menstrual, bleeding, cycles, however, the, condition, s, underlying, cause, is, energy, deficiency, and, should, be, treated, by, correcting, the, imbalance, between, calories, eaten, and, calories, burned, by, exercise, oral, contraceptives, should, not, be, used, as, an, initial, treatment, for, female, athlete, triad, while, combined, oral, contraceptives, are, generally, considered, to, be, a, relatively, safe, medication, they, are, contraindicated, for, those, with, certain, medical, conditions, the, world, health, organization, and, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, publish, guidance, called, medical, eligibility, criteria, on, the, safety, of, birth, control, in, the, context, of, medical, conditions, estrogen, in, high, doses, can, increase, risk, of, blood, clots, all, cocp, users, have, a, small, increase, in, the, risk, of, venous, thromboembolism, compared, with, non, users, this, risk, is, greatest, within, the, first, year, of, cocp, use, individuals, with, any, pre, existing, medical, condition, that, also, increases, their, risk, for, blood, clots, have, a, more, significant, increase, in, risk, of, thrombotic, events, with, cocp, use, these, conditions, include, but, are, not, limited, to, high, blood, pressure, pre, existing, cardiovascular, disease, such, as, valvular, heart, disease, or, ischemic, heart, disease, history, of, thromboembolism, or, pulmonary, embolism, cerebrovascular, accident, and, a, familial, tendency, to, form, blood, clots, such, as, familial, factor, v, leiden, there, are, conditions, that, when, associated, with, cocp, use, increase, risk, of, adverse, effects, other, than, thrombosis, for, example, women, with, a, history, of, migraine, with, aura, have, an, increased, risk, of, stroke, when, using, cocps, and, women, who, smoke, over, age, 35, and, use, cocps, are, at, higher, risk, of, myocardial, infarction, women, who, are, known, to, be, pregnant, should, not, take, cocps, those, in, the, postpartum, period, who, are, breastfeeding, are, also, advised, not, to, start, cocps, until, 4, weeks, after, birth, due, to, increased, risk, of, blood, clots, while, studies, have, demonstrated, conflicting, results, about, the, effects, of, cocps, on, lactation, duration, and, milk, volume, there, exist, concerns, about, the, transient, risk, of, cocps, on, breast, milk, production, when, breastfeeding, is, being, established, early, postpartum, due, to, the, stated, risks, and, additional, concerns, on, lactation, women, who, are, breastfeeding, are, not, advised, to, start, cocps, until, at, least, six, weeks, postpartum, while, women, who, are, not, breastfeeding, and, have, no, other, risks, factors, for, blood, clots, may, start, cocps, after, 21, days, postpartum, the, world, health, organization, who, does, not, recommend, the, use, of, cocps, in, women, with, breast, cancer, since, cocps, contain, both, estrogen, and, progestin, they, are, not, recommended, to, be, used, in, those, with, hormonally, sensitive, cancers, including, some, types, of, breast, cancer, non, hormonal, contraceptive, methods, such, as, the, copper, iud, or, condoms, should, be, the, first, line, contraceptive, choice, for, these, patients, instead, of, cocps, women, with, known, or, suspected, endometrial, cancer, or, unexplained, uterine, bleeding, should, also, not, take, cocps, to, avoid, health, risks, cocps, are, also, contraindicated, for, people, with, advanced, diabetes, liver, tumors, hepatic, adenoma, or, severe, cirrhosis, of, the, liver, cocps, are, metabolized, in, the, liver, and, thus, liver, disease, can, lead, to, reduced, elimination, of, the, medication, additionally, severe, hypercholesterolemia, and, hypertriglyceridemia, are, also, contraindications, but, the, evidence, showing, that, cocp, s, lead, to, worse, outcomes, in, this, population, is, weak, obesity, is, not, considered, to, be, a, contraindication, to, taking, cocps, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, health, risks, of, oral, contraceptives, are, lower, than, those, from, pregnancy, and, birth, and, the, health, benefits, of, any, method, of, contraception, are, far, greater, than, any, risks, from, the, method, some, organizations, have, argued, that, comparing, a, contraceptive, method, to, no, method, pregnancy, is, not, relevant, instead, the, comparison, of, safety, should, be, among, available, methods, of, contraception, different, sources, note, different, incidence, of, side, effects, the, most, common, side, effect, is, breakthrough, bleeding, coc, pills, can, improve, conditions, such, as, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual, syndrome, and, acne, reduce, symptoms, of, endometriosis, and, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, and, decrease, the, risk, of, anemia, use, of, oral, contraceptives, also, reduces, lifetime, risk, of, ovarian, and, endometrial, cancer, nausea, vomiting, headache, bloating, breast, tenderness, swelling, of, the, ankles, feet, fluid, retention, or, weight, change, may, occur, vaginal, bleeding, between, periods, spotting, or, missed, irregular, periods, may, occur, especially, during, the, first, few, months, of, use, combined, oral, contraceptives, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, venous, thromboembolism, including, deep, vein, thrombosis, dvt, and, pulmonary, embolism, pe, while, lower, doses, of, estrogen, in, coc, pills, may, have, a, lower, risk, of, stroke, and, myocardial, infarction, compared, to, higher, estrogen, dose, pills, 50, g, day, users, of, low, estrogen, dose, coc, pills, still, have, an, increased, risk, compared, to, non, users, these, risks, are, greatest, in, women, with, additional, risk, factors, such, as, smoking, which, increases, risk, substantially, and, long, continued, use, of, the, pill, especially, in, women, over, 35, years, of, age, the, overall, absolute, risk, of, venous, thrombosis, per, 100, 000, woman, years, in, current, use, of, combined, oral, contraceptives, is, approximately, 60, compared, with, 30, in, non, users, the, risk, of, thromboembolism, varies, with, different, types, of, birth, control, pills, compared, with, combined, oral, contraceptives, containing, levonorgestrel, lng, and, with, the, same, dose, of, estrogen, and, duration, of, use, the, rate, ratio, of, deep, venous, thrombosis, for, combined, oral, contraceptives, with, norethisterone, is, 0, 98, with, norgestimate, 1, 19, with, desogestrel, dsg, 1, 82, with, gestodene, 1, 86, with, drospirenone, drsp, 1, 64, and, with, cyproterone, acetate, 1, 88, in, comparison, venous, thromboembolism, occurs, in, 100, 200, per, 100, 000, pregnant, women, every, year, one, study, showed, more, than, a, 600, increased, risk, of, blood, clots, for, women, taking, cocps, with, drospirenone, compared, with, non, users, compared, with, 360, higher, for, women, taking, birth, control, pills, containing, levonorgestrel, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, initiated, studies, evaluating,

methods, do, not, cause, some, weight, change, but, no, major, effect, was, found, this, review, also, found, that, women, did, not, stop, using, the, pill, or, patch, because, of, weight, change, some, researchers, question, a, causal, link, between, cocp, use, and, decreased, libido, a, 2007, study, of, 1700, women, found, cocp, users, experienced, no, change, in, sexual, satisfaction, a, 2005, laboratory, study, of, genital, arousal, tested, fourteen, women, before, and, after, they, began, taking, cocps, the, study, found, that, women, experienced, a, significantly, wider, range, of,

than, those, who, never, used, it, and, levels, remained, elevated, even, in, the, group, that, had, discontinued, its, use, theoretically, an, increase, in, shbg, may, be, a, physiologic, response, to, increased, hormone, levels, but, may, decrease, the, free, levels, of, other, hormones, such, as, androgens, because, of, the, unspecificity, of, its, sex, hormone, binding, in, 2020, the, lancet,

androgens, estrogens, or, progesterone, inhibited, ovulation, but, obtaining, these, hormones, which, were, produced, from, animal, extracts, from, european, pharmaceutical, companies, was, extraordinarily, expensive, in, 1939, russell, marker, a, professor, of, organic, chemistry, at, pennsylvania, state, university, developed, a, method, of, synthesizing, progesterone, from, plant, steroid, sapogenins, initially, using, sarsapogenin, from, sarsaparilla, which, proved, too, expensive, after, three, years, of, extensive, botanical, research, he, discovered, a, much, better, starting, material, the, saponin, from, inedible, mexican, yams, dioscorea, mexicana, and, dioscorea, composita, found, in, the, rain, forests, of, veracruz, near, orizaba, the, saponin, could, be,

started, and, the, period, of, the, heyday, of, the, mexican, steroid, industry, had, been, started, syntex, broke, the, monopoly, of, european, pharmaceutical, companies, on, steroid, hormones, reducing, the, price, of, progesterone, almost, 200, fold, over, the, next, eight, years, midway, through, the, 20th, century, the, stage, was, set, for, the, development, of, a, hormonal, contraceptive, but, pharmaceutical, companies, universities, and, governments, showed, no, interest, in, pursuing, research, progesterone, given, by, injections, was, first, shown, to, inhibit, ovulation, in, animals, in, 1937, by, makepeace, and, colleagues, in, 1951, reproductive, physiologist, gregory, pincus, a, leader, in, hormone, research, and, co, founder, of, the, worcester, foundation, for, experimental, biology, wfeb, in, shrewsbury, massachusetts, first, met, american, birth, control, movement, founder, margaret, sanger, at, a, manhattan, dinner, hosted, by, abraham, stone, medical, director, and, vice, president, of, planned, parenthood, ppfa, who, helped, pincus, obtain, a, small, grant, from, ppfa, to, begin, hormonal, contraceptive, research, research, started, in, april, 1951, with, reproductive, physiologist, min, chueh, chang, repeating, and, extending, the, 1937, experiments, of, makepeace, et, al, that, was, published, in, 1953, and, showed, that, injections, of, progesterone, suppressed, ovulation, in, rabbits, in, october, 1951, g, d, searle, company, refused, pincus, request, to, fund, his, hormonal, contraceptive, research, but, retained, him, as, a, consultant, and, continued, to, provide, chemical, compounds, to, evaluate, in, march, 1952, sanger, wrote, a, brief, note, mentioning, pincus, research, to, her, longtime, friend, and, supporter, suffragist, and, philanthropist, katharine, dexter, mccormick, who, visited, the, wfeb, and, its, co, founder, and, old, friend, hudson, hoagland, in, june, 1952, to, learn, about, contraceptive, research, there, frustrated, when, research, stalled, from, ppfa, s, lack, of, interest, and, meager, funding, mccormick, arranged, a, meeting, at, the, wfeb, in, june, 1953, with, sanger, and, hoagland, where, she, first, met, pincus, who, committed, to, dramatically, expand, and, accelerate, research, with, mccormick, providing, fifty, times, ppfa, s, previous, funding, pincus, and, mccormick, enlisted, harvard, clinical, professor, of, gynecology, john, rock, chief, of, gynecology, at, the, free, hospital, for, women, and, an, expert, in, the, treatment, of, infertility, to, lead, clinical, research, with, women, at, a, scientific, conference, in, 1952, pincus, and, rock, who, had, known, each, other, for, many, years, discovered, they, were, using, similar, approaches, to, achieve, opposite, goals, in, 1952, rock, induced, a, three, month, anovulatory, pseudopregnancy, state, in, eighty, of, his, infertility, patients, with, continuous, gradually, increasing, oral, doses, of, an, estrogen, 5, to, 30, mg, day, diethylstilbestrol, and, progesterone, 50, to, 300, mg, day, and, within, the, following, four, months, 15, of, the, women, became, pregnant, in, 1953, at, pincus, suggestion, rock, induced, a, three, month, anovulatory, pseudopregnancy, state, in, twenty, seven, of, his, infertility, patients, with, an, oral, 300, mg, day, progesterone, only, regimen, for, 20, days, from, cycle, days, 5, 24, followed, by, pill, free, days, to, produce, withdrawal, bleeding, this, produced, the, same, 15, pregnancy, rate, during, the, following, four, months, without, the, amenorrhea, of, the, previous, continuous, estrogen, and, progesterone, regimen, but, 20, of, the, women, experienced, breakthrough, bleeding, and, in, the, first, cycle, ovulation, was, suppressed, in, only, 85, of, the, women, indicating, that, even, higher, and, more, expensive, oral, doses, of, progesterone, would, be, needed, to, initially, consistently, suppress, ovulation, similarly, ishikawa, and, colleagues, found, that, ovulation, inhibition, occurred, in, only, a, proportion, of, cases, with, 300, mg, day, oral, progesterone, despite, the, incomplete, inhibition, of, ovulation, by, oral, progesterone, no, pregnancies, occurred, in, the, two, studies, although, this, could, have, simply, been, due, to, chance, however, ishikawa, et, al, reported, that, the, cervical, mucus, in, women, taking, oral, progesterone, became, impenetrable, to, sperm, and, this, may, have, accounted, for, the, absence, of, pregnancies, progesterone, was, abandoned, as, an, oral, ovulation, inhibitor, following, these, clinical, studies, due, to, the, high, and, expensive, doses, required, incomplete, inhibition, of, ovulation, and, the, frequent, incidence, of, breakthrough, bleeding, instead, researchers, would, turn, to, much, more, potent, synthetic, progestogens, for, use, in, oral, contraception, in, the, future, in, october, 1951, chemist, luis, miramontes, working, under, the, supervision, of, carl, djerassi, and, the, direction, of, george, rosenkranz, at, syntex, in, mexico, city, synthesized, the, first, oral, contraceptive, which, was, based, on, highly, active, progestin, norethisterone, frank, b, colton, at, searle, in, skokie, illinois, synthesized, the, orally, highly, active, progestins, noretynodrel, an, isomer, of, norethisterone, in, 1952, and, norethandrolone, in, 1953, pincus, asked, his, contacts, at, pharmaceutical, companies, to, send, him, chemical, compounds, with, progestogenic, activity, chang, screened, nearly, 200, chemical, compounds, in, animals, and, found, the, three, most, promising, were, syntex, s, norethisterone, and, searle, s, noretynodrel, and, norethandrolone, in, december, 1954, rock, began, the, first, studies, of, the, ovulation, suppressing, potential, of, 5, 50, mg, doses, of, the, three, oral, progestins, for, three, months, for, 21, days, per, cycle, days, 5, 25, followed, by, pill, free, days, to, produce, withdrawal, bleeding, in, fifty, of, his, patients, with, infertility, in, brookline, massachusetts, norethisterone, or, noretynodrel, 5, mg, doses, and, all, doses, of, norethandrolone, suppressed, ovulation, but, caused, breakthrough, bleeding, but, 10, mg, and, higher, doses, of, norethisterone, or, noretynodrel, suppressed, ovulation, without, breakthrough, bleeding, and, led, to, a, 14, pregnancy, rate, in, the, following, five, months, pincus, and, rock, selected, searle, s, noretynodrel, for, the, first, contraceptive, trials, in, women, citing, its, total, lack, of, androgenicity, versus, syntex, s, norethisterone, very, slight, androgenicity, in, animal, tests, noretynodrel, and, norethisterone, were, subsequently, discovered, to, be, contaminated, with, a, small, percentage, of, the, estrogen, mestranol, an, intermediate, in, their, synthesis, with, the, noretynodrel, in, rock, s, 1954, 5, study, containing, 4, 7, mestranol, when, further, purifying, noretynodrel, to, contain, less, than, 1, mestranol, led, to, breakthrough, bleeding, it, was, decided, to, intentionally, incorporate, 2, 2, mestranol, a, percentage, that, was, not, associated, with, breakthrough, bleeding, in, the, first, contraceptive, trials, in, women, in, 1954, the, noretynodrel, and, mestranol, combination, was, given, the, proprietary, name, enovid, the, first, contraceptive, trial, of, enovid, led, by, celso, ram, n, garc, a, and, edris, rice, wray, began, in, april, 1956, in, r, o, piedras, puerto, rico, a, second, contraceptive, trial, of, enovid, and, norethisterone, led, by, edward, t, tyler, began, in, june, 1956, in, los, angeles, in, january, 1957, searle, held, a, symposium, reviewing, gynecologic, and, contraceptive, research, on, enovid, through, 1956, and, concluded, enovid, s, estrogen, content, could, be, reduced, by, 33, to, lower, the, incidence, of, estrogenic, gastrointestinal, side, effects, without, significantly, increasing, the, incidence, of, breakthrough, bleeding, while, these, large, scale, trials, contributed, to, the, initial, understanding, of, the, pill, formulation, s, clinical, effects, the, ethical, implications, of, the, trials, generated, significant, controversy, of, note, is, the, apparent, lack, of, both, autonomy, and, informed, consent, among, participants, in, the, puerto, rican, cohort, prior, to, the, trials, many, of, these, participants, hailed, from, impoverished, working, class, backgrounds, in, june, 1957, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, enovid, 10, mg, 9, 85, mg, noretynodrel, and, 150, g, mestranol, for, menstrual, disorders, based, on, data, from, its, use, by, more, than, 600, women, numerous, additional, contraceptive, trials, showed, enovid, at, 10, 5, and, 2, 5, mg, doses, to, be, highly, effective, in, july, 1959, searle, filed, a, supplemental, application, to, add, contraception, as, an, approved, indication, for, 10, 5, and, 2, 5, mg, doses, of, enovid, the, fda, refused, to, consider, the, application, until, searle, agreed, to, withdraw, the, lower, dosage, forms, from, the, application, in, may, 1960, the, fda, announced, it, would, approve, enovid, 10, mg, for, contraceptive, use, and, did, so, in, june, 1960, at, that, point, enovid, 10, mg, had, been, in, general, use, for, three, years, and, by, conservative, estimate, at, least, half, a, million, women, had, used, it, although, fda, approved, for, contraceptive, use, searle, never, marketed, enovid, 10, mg, as, a, contraceptive, eight, months, later, in, february, 1961, the, fda, approved, enovid, 5, mg, for, contraceptive, use, in, july, 1961, searle, finally, began, marketing, enovid, 5, mg, 5, mg, noretynodrel, and, 75, g, mestranol, to, physicians, as, a, contraceptive, although, the, fda, approved, the, first, oral, contraceptive, in, 1960, contraceptives, were, not, available, to, married, women, in, all, states, until, griswold, v, connecticut, in, 1965, and, were, not, available, to, unmarried, women, in, all, states, until, eisenstadt, v, baird, in, 1972, the, first, published, case, report, of, a, blood, clot, and, pulmonary, embolism, in, a, woman, using, enavid, enovid, 10, mg, in, the, us, at, a, dose, of, 20, mg, day, did, not, appear, until, november, 1961, four, years, after, its, approval, by, which, time, it, had, been, used, by, over, one, million, women, it, would, take, almost, a, decade, of, epidemiological, studies, to, conclusively, establish, an, increased, risk, of, venous, thrombosis, in, oral, contraceptive, users, and, an, increased, risk, of, stroke, and, myocardial, infarction, in, oral, contraceptive, users, who, smoke, or, have, high, blood, pressure, or, other, cardiovascular, or, cerebrovascular, risk, factors, these, risks, of, oral, contraceptives, were, dramatized, in, the, 1969, book, the, doctors, case, against, the, pill, by, feminist, journalist, barbara, seaman, who, helped, arrange, the, 1970, nelson, pill, hearings, called, by, senator, gaylord, nelson, the, hearings, were, conducted, by, senators, who, were, all, men, and, the, witnesses, in, the, first, round, of, hearings, were, all, men, leading, alice, wolfson, and, other, feminists, to, protest, the, hearings, and, generate, media, attention, their, work, led, to, mandating, the, inclusion, of, patient, package, inserts, with, oral, contraceptives, to, explain, their, possible, side, effects, and, risks, to, help, facilitate, informed, consent, today, s, standard, dose, oral, contraceptives, contain, an, estrogen, dose, that, is, one, third, lower, than, the, first, marketed, oral, contraceptive, and, contain, lower, doses, of, different, more, potent, progestins, in, a, variety, of, formulations, beginning, in, 2015, certain, states, passed, legislation, allowing, pharmacists, to, prescribe, oral, contraceptives, such, legislation, was, considered, to, address, physician, shortages, and, decrease, barriers, to, birth, control, for, women, pharmacists, in, oregon, california, colorado, hawaii, maryland, and, new, mexico, have, authority, to, prescribe, birth, control, after, receiving, specialized, training, and, certification, from, their, respective, state, board, of, pharmacy, as, of, january, 2024, pharmacists, in, 29, states, can, prescribe, oral, contraceptives, the, first, oral, contraceptive, introduced, outside, the, united, states, was, schering, s, anovlar, norethisterone, acetate, 4, mg, ethinylestradiol, 50, g, in, january, 1961, in, australia, the, first, oral, contraceptive, introduced, in, europe, was, schering, s, anovlar, in, june, 1961, in, west, germany, the, lower, hormonal, dose, still, in, use, was, studied, by, the, belgian, gynaecologist, ferdinand, peeters, before, the, mid, 1960s, the, united, kingdom, did, not, require, pre, marketing, approval, of, drugs, the, british, family, planning, association, fpa, through, its, clinics, was, then, the, primary, provider, of, family, planning, services, in, the, uk, and, provided, only, contraceptives, that, were, on, its, approved, list, of, contraceptives, established, in, 1934, in, 1957, searle, began, marketing, enavid, enovid, 10, mg, in, the, us, for, menstrual, disorders, also, in, 1957, the, fpa, established, a, council, for, the, investigation, of, fertility, control, cifc, to, test, and, monitor, oral, contraceptives, which, began, animal, testing, of, oral, contraceptives, and, in, 1960, and, 1961, began, three, large, clinical, trials, in, birmingham, slough, and, london, in, march, 1960, the, birmingham, fpa, began, trials, of, noretynodrel, 2, 5, mg, mestranol, 50, g, but, a, high, pregnancy, rate, initially, occurred, when, the, pills, accidentally, contained, only, 36, g, of, mestranol, the, trials, were, continued, with, noretynodrel, 5, mg, mestranol, 75, g, conovid, in, the, uk, enovid, 5, mg, in, the, us, in, august, 1960, the, slough, fpa, began, trials, of, noretynodrel, 2, 5, mg, mestranol, 100, g, conovid, e, in, the, uk, enovid, e, in, the, us, in, may, 1961, the, london, fpa, began, trials, of, schering, s, anovlar, in, october, 1961, at, the, recommendation, of, the, medical, advisory, council, of, its, cifc, the, fpa, added, searle, s, conovid, to, its, approved, list, of, contraceptives, in, december, 1961, enoch, powell, then, minister, of, health, announced, that, the, oral, contraceptive, pill, conovid, could, be, prescribed, through, the, nhs, at, a, subsidized, price, of, 2, s, per, month, in, 1962, schering, s, anovlar, and, searle, s, conovid, e, were, added, to, the, fpa, s, approved, list, of, contraceptives, in, december, 1967, the, neuwirth, law, legalized, contraception, in, france, including, the, pill, the, pill, is, the, most, popular, form, of, contraception, in, france, especially, among, young, women, it, accounts, for, 60, of, the, birth, control, used, in, france, the, abortion, rate, has, remained, stable, since, the, introduction, of, the, pill, in, japan, lobbying, from, the, japan, medical, association, prevented, the, pill, from, being, approved, for, general, use, for, nearly, 40, years, the, higher, dose, second, generation, pill, was, approved, for, use, in, cases, of, gynecological, problems, but, not, for, birth, control, two, main, objections, raised, by, the, association, were, safety, concerns, over, long, term, use, of, the, pill, and, concerns, that, pill, use, would, lead, to, decreased, use, of, condoms, and, thereby, potentially, increase, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, rates, however, when, the, ministry, of, health, and, welfare, approved, viagra, s, use, in, japan, after, only, six, months, of, the, application, s, submission, while, still, claiming, that, the, pill, required, more, data, before, approval, women, s, groups, cried, foul, the, pill, was, subsequently, approved, for, use, in, june, 1999, when, japan, became, the, last, un, member, country, to, do, so, however, the, pill, has, not, become, popular, in, japan, according, to, estimates, only, 1, 3, percent, of, 28, million, japanese, females, of, childbearing, age, use, the, pill, compared, with, 15, 6, percent, in, the, united, states, the, pill, prescription, guidelines, the, government, has, endorsed, require, pill, users, to, visit, a, doctor, every, three, months, for, pelvic, examinations, and, undergo, tests, for, sexually, transmitted, diseases, and, uterine, cancer, in, the, united, states, and, europe, in, contrast, an, annual, or, bi, annual, clinic, visit, is, standard, for, pill, users, however, beginning, as, far, back, as, 2007, many, japanese, obgyns, have, required, only, a, yearly, visit, for, pill, users, with, multiple, checks, a, year, recommended, only, for, those, who, are, older, or, at, increased, risk, of, side, effects, as, of, 2004, condoms, accounted, for, 80, of, birth, control, use, in, japan, and, this, may, explain, japan, s, comparatively, low, rates, of, aids, the, pill, was, approved, by, the, fda, in, the, early, 1960s, its, use, spread, rapidly, in, the, late, part, of, that, decade, generating, an, enormous, social, impact, time, magazine, placed, the, pill, on, its, cover, in, april, 1967, in, the, first, place, it, was, more, effective, than, most, previous, reversible, methods, of, birth, control, giving, women, unprecedented, control, over, their, fertility, its, use, was, separate, from, intercourse, requiring, no, special, preparations, at, the, time, of, sexual, activity, that, might, interfere, with, spontaneity, or, sensation, and, the, choice, to, take, the, pill, was, a, private, one, this, combination, of, factors, served, to, make, the, pill, immensely, popular, within, a, few, years, of, its, introduction, claudia, goldin, among, others, argue, that, this, new, contraceptive, technology, was, a, key, player, in, forming, women, s, modern, economic, role, in, that, it, prolonged, the, age, at, which, women, first, married, allowing, them, to, invest, in, education, and, other, forms, of, human, capital, as, well, as, generally, become, more, career, oriented, soon, after, the, birth, control, pill, was, legalized, there, was, a, sharp, increase, in, college, attendance, and, graduation, rates, for, women, from, an, economic, point, of, view, the, birth, control, pill, reduced, the, cost, of, staying, in, school, the, ability, to, control, fertility, without, sacrificing, sexual, relationships, allowed, women, to, make, long, term, educational, and, career, plans, because, the, pill, was, so, effective, and, soon, so, widespread, it, also, heightened, the, debate, about, the, moral, and, health, consequences, of, pre, marital, sex, and, promiscuity, never, before, had, sexual, activity, been, so, divorced, from, reproduction, for, a, couple, using, the, pill, intercourse, became, purely, an, expression, of, love, or, a, means, of, physical, pleasure, or, both, but, it, was, no, longer, a, means, of, reproduction, while, this, was, true, of, previous, contraceptives, their, relatively, high, failure, rates, and, their, less, widespread, use, failed, to, emphasize, this, distinction, as, clearly, as, did, the, pill, the, spread, of, oral, contraceptive, use, thus, led, many, religious, figures, and, institutions, to, debate, the, proper, role, of, sexuality, and, its, relationship, to, procreation, the, roman, catholic, church, in, particular, after, studying, the, phenomenon, of, oral, contraceptives, re, emphasized, the, stated, teaching, on, birth, control, in, the, 1968, papal, encyclical, humanae, vitae, the, encyclical, reiterated, the, established, catholic, teaching, that, artificial, contraception, distorts, the, nature, and, purpose, of, sex, on, the, other, side, anglican, and, other, protestant, churches, such, as, the, protestant, church, in, germany, ekd, accepted, the, combined, oral, contraceptive, pill, the, united, states, senate, began, hearings, on, the, pill, in, 1970, and, where, different, viewpoints, were, heard, from, medical, professionals, dr, michael, newton, president, of, the, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, said, the, evidence, is, not, yet, clear, that, these, still, do, in, fact, cause, cancer, or, related, to, it, the, fda, advisory, committee, made, comments, about, this, that, if, there, wasn, t, enough, evidence, to, indicate, whether, or, not, these, pills, were, related, to, the, development, of, cancer, and, i, think, that, s, still, thin, you, have, to, be, cautious, about, them, but, i, don, t, think, there, is, clear, evidence, either, one, way, or, the, other, that, they, do, or, don, t, cause, cancer, another, physician, dr, roy, hertz, of, the, population, council, said, that, anyone, who, takes, this, should, know, of, our, knowledge, and, ignorance, in, these, matters, and, that, all, women, should, be, made, aware, of, this, so, they, can, decide, to, take, the, pill, or, not, the, secretary, of, health, education, and, welfare, at, the, time, robert, finch, announced, the, federal, government, had, accepted, a, compromise, warning, statement, which, would, accompany, all, sales, of, birth, control, pills, the, introduction, of, the, birth, control, pill, in, 1960, allowed, more, women, to, find, employment, opportunities, and, further, their, education, as, a, result, of, women, getting, more, jobs, and, an, education, their, husbands, had, to, start, taking, over, household, tasks, like, cooking, wanting, to, stop, the, change, that, was, occurring, in, terms, of, gender, norms, in, an, american, household, many, films, television, shows, and, other, popular, culture, items, portrayed, what, an, ideal, american, family, should, be, below, are, listed, some, examples, a, woman, using, cocps, excretes, in, her, urine, and, feces, natural, estrogens, estrone, e1, and, estradiol, e2, and, synthetic, estrogen, ethinylestradiol, ee2, these, hormones, can, pass, through, water, treatment, plants, and, into, rivers, other, forms, of, contraception, such, as, the, contraceptive, patch, use, the, same, synthetic, estrogen, ee2, that, is, found, in, cocps, and, can, add, to, the, hormonal, concentration, in, the, water, when, flushed, down, the, toilet, this, excretion, is, shown, to, play, a, role, in, causing, endocrine, disruption, which, affects, the, sexual, development, and, reproduction, of, wild, fish, populations, in, segments, of, streams, contaminated, by, treated, sewage, effluents, a, study, done, in, british, rivers, supported, the, hypothesis, that, the, incidence, and, the, severity, of, intersex, wild, fish, populations, were, significantly, correlated, with, the, concentrations, of, the, e1, e2, and, ee2, in, the, rivers, a, review, of, activated, sludge, plant, performance, found, estrogen, removal, rates, varied, considerably, but, averaged, 78, for, estrone, 91, for, estradiol, and, 76, for, ethinylestradiol, estriol, effluent, concentrations, are, between, those, of, estrone, and, estradiol, but, estriol, is, a, much, less, potent, endocrine, disruptor, to, fish, several, studies, have, suggested, that, reducing, human, population, growth, through, increased, access, to, contraception, including, birth, control, pills, can, be, an, effective, strategy, for, climate, change, mitigation, as, well, as, adaptation, according, to, thomas, wire, contraception, is, the, greenest, technology, because, of, its, cost, effectiveness, in, combating, global, warming, each, 7, spent, on, contraceptives, would, reduce, global, carbon, emissions, by, 1, tonne, over, four, decades, while, achieving, the, same, result, with, low, carbon, technologies, would, require, 32, mechanism, of, action, cocs, prevent, fertilization, and, therefore, qualify, as, contraceptives, there, is, no, significant, evidence, that, they, work, after, fertilization, the, progestins, in, all, cocs, provide, most, of, the, contraceptive, effect, by, suppressing, ovulation, and, thickening, cervical, mucus, although, the, estrogens, also, make, a, small, contribution, to, ovulation, suppression, cycle, control, is, enhanced, by, the, estrogen, because, cocs, so, effectively, suppress, ovulation, and, block, ascent, of, sperm, into, the, upper, genital, tract, the, potential, impact, on, endometrial, receptivity, to, implantation, is, almost, academic, when, the, two, primary, mechanisms, fail, the, fact, that, pregnancy, occurs, despite, the, endometrial, changes, demonstrates, that, those, endometrial, changes, do, not, significantly, contribute, to, the, pill, s, mechanism, of, action, ten, different, progestins, have, been, used, in, the, cocs, that, have, been, sold, in, the, united, states, several, different, classification, systems, for, the, progestins, exist, but, the, one, most, commonly, used, system, recapitulates, the, history, of, the, pill, in, the, united, states, by, categorizing, the, progestins, into, the, so, called, generations, of, progestins, the, first, three, generations, of, progestins, are, derived, from, 19, nortestosterone, the, fourth, generation, is, drospirenone, newer, progestins, are, hybrids, first, generation, progestins, first, generation, progestins, include, noretynodrel, norethisterone, norethisterone, acetate, and, etynodiol, diacetate, these, compounds, have, the, lowest, potency, and, relatively, short, half, lives, the, short, half, life, did, not, matter, in, the, early, high, dose, pills, but, as, doses, of, progestin, were, decreased, in, the, more, modern, pills, problems, with, unscheduled, spotting, and, bleeding, became, more, common, second, generation, progestins, to, solve, the, problem, of, unscheduled, bleeding, and, spotting, the, second, generation, progestins, norgestrol, and, levonorgestrel, were, designed, to, be, significantly, more, potent, and, to, have, longer, half, lives, than, norethisterone, related, progestins, the, second, generation, progestins, have, been, associated, with, more, androgen, related, side, effects, such, as, adverse, effect, on, lipids, oily, skin, acne, and, facial, hair, growth, third, generation, progestins, third, generation, progestins, desogestrel, norgestimate, and, elsewhere, gestodene, were, introduced, to, maintain, the, potent, progestational, activity, of, second, generation, progestins, but, to, reduce, androgeneic, side, effects, reduction, in, androgen, impacts, allows, a, fuller, expression, of, the, pill, s, estrogen, impacts, this, has, some, clinical, benefits, on, the, other, hand, concern, arose, that, the, increased, expression, of, estrogen, might, increase, the, risk, of, venous, thromboembolism, vte, this, concern, introduced, a, pill, scare, in, europe, until, international, studies, were, completed, and, correctly, interpreted, fourth, generation, progestins, drospirenone, is, an, analogue, of, spironolactone, a, potassium, sparing, diuretic, used, to, treat, hypertension, drospirenone, possesses, anti, mineralocorticoid, and, anti, androgenic, properties, these, properties, have, led, to, new, contraceptive, applications, such, as, treatment, of, premenstrual, dysphoric, disorder, and, acne, in, the, wake, of, concerns, around, possible, increased, vte, risk, with, less, androgenic, third, generation, formulations, those, issues, were, anticipated, with, drospirenone, they, were, clearly, answered, by, large, international, studies, next, generation, progestins, progestins, have, been, developed, with, properties, that, are, shared, with, different, generations, of, progestins, they, have, more, profound, diverse, and, discrete, effects, on, the, endometrium, than, prior, progestins, this, class, would, include, dienogest, united, states, and, nomegestrol, europe
