old, age, is, the, range, of, ages, for, people, nearing, and, surpassing, life, expectancy, people, of, old, age, are, also, referred, to, as, old, people, elderly, elders, seniors, senior, citizens, or, older, adults, old, age, is, not, a, definite, biological, stage, the, chronological, age, denoted, as, old, age, varies, culturally, and, historically, some, disciplines, and, domains, focus, on, the, aging, and, the, aged, such, as, the, organic, processes, of, aging, senescence, medical, studies, of, the, aging, process, gerontology, diseases, that, afflict, older, adults, geriatrics, technology, to, support, the, aging, society, gerontechnology, and, leisure, and, sport, activities, adapted, to, older, people, such, as, senior, sport, old, people, often, have, limited, regenerative, abilities, and, are, more, susceptible, to, illness, and, injury, than, younger, adults, they, face, social, problems, related, to, retirement, loneliness, and, ageism, in, 2011, the, united, nations, proposed, a, human, rights, convention, to, protect, old, people, definitions, of, old, age, include, official, definitions, sub, group, definitions, and, four, dimensions, as, follows, most, developed, western, countries, set, the, retirement, age, around, the, age, of, 65, this, is, also, generally, considered, to, mark, the, transition, from, middle, to, old, age, reaching, this, age, is, commonly, a, requirement, to, become, eligible, for, senior, social, programs, old, age, cannot, be, universally, defined, because, it, is, context, sensitive, the, united, nations, for, example, considers, old, age, to, be, 60, years, or, older, in, contrast, a, 2001, joint, report, by, the, u, s, national, institute, on, aging, and, the, world, health, organization, regional, office, for, africa, set, the, beginning, of, old, age, in, sub, saharan, africa, at, 50, this, lower, threshold, stems, primarily, from, a, different, way, of, thinking, about, old, age, in, developing, nations, unlike, in, the, developed, world, where, chronological, age, determines, retirement, societies, in, developing, countries, determine, old, age, according, to, a, person, s, ability, to, make, active, contributions, to, society, this, number, is, also, significantly, affected, by, lower, life, expectancy, throughout, the, developing, world, dating, back, to, the, middle, ages, and, prior, what, certain, scholars, thought, of, as, old, age, varied, depending, on, the, context, but, the, state, of, being, elderly, was, often, thought, as, being, 60, years, of, age, or, older, in, many, respects, gerontologists, have, recognized, that, people, experience, very, different, conditions, as, they, approach, old, age, in, developed, countries, many, people, in, their, later, 60s, and, 70s, frequently, called, early, old, age, are, still, fit, active, and, able, to, care, for, themselves, 607, however, after, 80, they, generally, become, increasingly, frail, a, condition, marked, by, serious, mental, and, physical, debilitation, therefore, rather, than, lumping, together, all, people, who, have, been, defined, as, old, some, gerontologists, have, recognized, the, diversity, of, old, age, by, defining, sub, groups, one, study, distinguishes, the, young, old, 60, to, 69, the, middle, old, 70, to, 79, and, the, very, old, 80, another, study, s, sub, grouping, is, young, old, 65, to, 74, middle, old, 75, to, 84, and, oldest, old, 85, a, third, sub, grouping, is, young, old, 65, to, 74, old, 74, to, 84, and, old, old, 85, describing, sub, groups, in, the, 65, population, enables, a, more, accurate, portrayal, of, significant, life, changes, 4, two, british, scholars, paul, higgs, and, chris, gilleard, have, added, a, fourth, age, sub, group, in, british, english, the, third, age, is, the, period, in, life, of, active, retirement, following, middle, age, higgs, and, gilleard, describe, the, fourth, age, as, an, arena, of, inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and, ultimately, unsuccessful, ageing, key, concepts, in, social, gerontology, lists, four, dimensions, chronological, biological, psychological, and, social, 12, 3, wattis, and, curran, add, a, fifth, dimension, developmental, chronological, age, may, differ, considerably, from, a, person, s, functional, age, the, distinguishing, marks, of, old, age, normally, occur, in, all, five, senses, at, different, times, and, at, different, rates, for, different, people, in, addition, to, chronological, age, people, can, be, considered, old, because, of, the, other, dimensions, of, old, age, for, example, people, may, be, considered, old, when, they, become, grandparents, or, when, they, begin, to, do, less, or, different, work, in, retirement, senior, citizen, is, a, common, euphemism, for, an, old, person, used, in, american, english, and, sometimes, in, british, english, it, implies, that, the, person, being, referred, to, is, retired, this, in, turn, usually, implies, that, the, person, is, over, the, retirement, age, which, varies, according, to, country, synonyms, include, old, age, pensioner, or, pensioner, in, british, english, and, retiree, and, senior, in, american, english, some, dictionaries, describe, widespread, use, of, senior, citizen, for, people, over, the, age, of, 65, when, defined, in, a, legal, context, senior, citizen, is, often, used, for, legal, or, policy, related, reasons, in, determining, who, is, eligible, for, certain, benefits, available, to, the, age, group, it, is, used, in, general, usage, instead, of, traditional, terms, such, as, old, person, old, age, pensioner, or, elderly, as, a, courtesy, and, to, signify, continuing, relevance, of, and, respect, for, this, population, group, as, citizens, of, society, of, senior, rank, the, term, was, apparently, coined, in, 1938, during, a, political, campaign, famed, caricaturist, al, hirschfeld, claimed, on, several, occasions, that, his, father, isaac, hirschfeld, invented, the, term, senior, citizen, it, has, come, into, widespread, use, in, recent, decades, in, legislation, commerce, and, common, speech, especially, in, less, formal, contexts, it, is, often, abbreviated, as, senior, s, which, is, also, used, as, an, adjective, the, age, of, 65, has, long, been, considered, the, benchmark, for, senior, citizenship, in, numerous, countries, this, convention, originated, from, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, s, introduction, of, the, pension, system, in, germany, during, the, late, 19th, century, bismarck, s, legislation, set, the, retirement, age, at, 70, with, 65, as, the, age, at, which, individuals, could, start, receiving, a, pension, this, age, standard, gradually, gained, acceptance, in, other, nations, and, has, since, become, deeply, entrenched, in, public, consciousness, the, age, which, qualifies, for, senior, citizen, status, varies, widely, in, governmental, contexts, it, is, usually, associated, with, an, age, at, which, pensions, or, medical, benefits, for, the, elderly, become, available, in, commercial, contexts, where, it, may, serve, as, a, marketing, device, to, attract, customers, the, age, is, often, significantly, lower, in, commerce, some, businesses, offer, customers, of, a, certain, age, a, senior, discount, the, age, at, which, these, discounts, are, available, varies, from, 55, 60, 62, or, 65, upwards, and, other, criteria, may, also, apply, sometimes, a, special, senior, discount, card, or, other, proof, of, age, needs, to, be, produced, to, show, entitlement, in, the, united, states, the, standard, retirement, age, is, currently, 66, gradually, increasing, to, 67, the, aarp, allows, couples, in, which, one, spouse, has, reached, the, age, of, 50, to, join, regardless, of, the, age, of, the, other, spouse, in, canada, the, old, age, security, oas, pension, is, available, at, 65, the, conservative, government, of, stephen, harper, had, planned, to, gradually, increase, the, age, of, eligibility, to, 67, starting, in, the, years, 2023, 2029, although, the, liberal, government, of, justin, trudeau, is, considering, leaving, it, at, 65, and, the, canada, pension, plan, cpp, as, early, as, age, 60, the, distinguishing, characteristics, of, old, age, are, both, physical, and, mental, the, marks, of, old, age, are, so, unlike, the, marks, of, middle, age, that, legal, scholar, richard, posner, suggests, that, as, an, individual, transitions, into, old, age, that, person, can, be, thought, of, as, different, people, time, sharing, the, same, identity, 86, 7, these, marks, do, not, occur, at, the, same, chronological, age, for, everyone, also, they, occur, at, different, rates, and, order, for, different, people, marks, of, old, age, can, easily, vary, between, people, of, the, same, chronological, age, a, basic, mark, of, old, age, that, affects, both, body, and, mind, is, slowness, of, behavior, the, term, describes, a, correlation, between, advancing, age, and, slowness, of, reaction, and, physical, and, mental, task, performance, however, studies, from, buffalo, university, and, northwestern, university, have, shown, that, the, elderly, are, a, happier, age, group, than, their, younger, counterparts, physical, marks, of, old, age, include, the, following, mental, marks, of, old, age, include, the, following, many, books, written, by, authors, in, middle, adulthood, depict, a, few, common, perceptions, on, old, age, one, writer, notices, the, change, in, his, parents, they, move, slowly, they, have, less, strength, they, repeat, stories, their, minds, wander, and, they, fret, another, writer, sees, her, aged, parents, and, is, bewildered, they, refuse, to, follow, her, advice, they, are, obsessed, with, the, past, they, avoid, risk, and, they, live, at, a, glacial, pace, in, her, the, denial, of, aging, dr, muriel, r, gillick, a, baby, boomer, accuses, her, contemporaries, of, believing, that, by, proper, exercise, and, diet, they, can, avoid, the, scourges, of, old, age, and, proceed, from, middle, age, to, death, studies, find, that, many, people, in, the, 65, 84, range, can, postpone, morbidity, by, practicing, healthy, lifestyles, however, at, about, age, 85, most, people, experience, similar, morbidity, even, with, healthy, lifestyles, most, 85, people, will, undergo, extended, frailty, and, disability, early, old, age, can, be, a, pleasant, time, children, are, grown, work, is, over, and, there, is, time, to, pursue, other, interests, 603, many, old, people, are, also, willing, to, get, involved, in, community, and, activist, organizations, to, promote, their, well, being, in, contrast, perceptions, of, old, age, by, writers, 80, years, old, tend, to, be, negative, georges, minois, writes, that, the, first, man, known, to, talk, about, his, old, age, was, an, egyptian, scribe, who, lived, 4, 500, years, ago, the, scribe, addressed, god, with, a, prayer, of, lament, 14, o, sovereign, my, lord, oldness, has, come, old, age, has, descended, feebleness, has, arrived, dotage, is, here, anew, the, heart, sleeps, wearily, every, day, the, eyes, are, weak, the, ears, are, deaf, the, strength, is, disappearing, because, of, weariness, of, the, heart, and, the, mouth, is, silent, and, cannot, speak, the, heart, is, forgetful, and, cannot, recall, yesterday, the, bone, suffers, old, age, good, is, become, evil, all, taste, is, gone, what, old, age, does, to, men, is, evil, in, every, respect, 14, 5, minois, comments, that, the, scribe, s, cry, shows, that, nothing, has, changed, in, the, drama, of, decrepitude, between, the, age, of, the, pharaoh, and, the, atomic, age, and, expresses, all, the, anguish, of, old, people, in, the, past, and, the, present, 14, lillian, rubin, active, in, her, 80s, as, an, author, sociologist, and, psychotherapist, opens, her, book, 60, on, up, the, truth, about, aging, in, america, with, getting, old, sucks, it, always, has, it, always, will, dr, rubin, contrasts, the, real, old, age, with, the, rosy, pictures, painted, by, middle, age, writers, writing, at, the, age, of, 87, mary, c, morrison, describes, the, heroism, required, by, old, age, to, live, through, the, disintegration, of, one, s, own, body, or, that, of, someone, you, love, morrison, concludes, old, age, is, not, for, the, fainthearted, in, the, book, life, beyond, 85, years, the, 150, interviewees, had, to, cope, with, physical, and, mental, debilitation, and, with, losses, of, loved, ones, one, interviewee, described, living, in, old, age, as, pure, hell, 7, 8, 208, research, has, shown, that, in, high, income, countries, on, average, one, in, four, people, over, 60, and, one, in, three, over, 75, feels, lonely, johnson, and, barer, did, a, pioneering, study, of, life, beyond, 85, years, by, interviews, over, a, six, year, period, in, talking, with, 85, year, olds, and, older, they, found, some, popular, conceptions, about, old, age, to, be, erroneous, such, erroneous, conceptions, include, 1, people, in, old, age, have, at, least, one, family, member, for, support, 2, old, age, well, being, requires, social, activity, and, 3, successful, adaptation, to, age, related, changes, demands, a, continuity, of, self, concept, in, their, interviews, johnson, and, barer, found, that, 24, of, the, 85, had, no, face, to, face, family, relationships, many, have, outlived, their, families, second, that, contrary, to, popular, notions, the, interviews, revealed, that, the, reduced, activity, and, socializing, of, the, over, 85s, does, not, harm, their, well, being, they, welcome, increased, detachment, third, rather, than, a, continuity, of, self, concept, as, the, interviewees, faced, new, situations, they, changed, their, cognitive, and, emotional, processes, and, reconstituted, their, self, representation, 5, 6, based, on, his, survey, of, old, age, in, history, georges, minois, concludes, that, it, is, clear, that, always, and, everywhere, youth, has, been, preferred, to, old, age, in, western, thought, old, age, is, an, evil, an, infirmity, and, a, dreary, time, of, preparation, for, death, furthermore, death, is, often, preferred, over, decrepitude, because, death, means, deliverance, 303, the, problem, of, the, ambiguity, of, old, age, has, been, with, us, since, the, stage, of, primitive, society, it, was, both, the, source, of, wisdom, and, of, infirmity, experience, and, decrepitude, of, prestige, and, suffering, 11, in, the, classical, period, of, greek, and, roman, cultures, old, age, was, denigrated, as, a, time, of, decline, and, decrepitude, 6, 7, beauty, and, strength, were, esteemed, and, old, age, was, viewed, as, defiling, and, ugly, old, age, was, reckoned, as, one, of, the, unanswerable, great, mysteries, along, with, evil, pain, and, suffering, decrepitude, which, shrivels, heroes, seemed, worse, than, death, 43, historical, periods, reveal, a, mixed, picture, of, the, position, and, status, of, old, people, but, there, has, never, been, a, golden, age, of, aging, 6, studies, have, challenged, the, popular, belief, that, in, the, past, old, people, were, venerated, by, society, and, cared, for, by, their, families, 1, veneration, for, and, antagonism, toward, the, aged, have, coexisted, in, complex, relationships, throughout, history, old, people, were, respected, or, despised, honoured, or, put, to, death, according, to, circumstance, 11, in, ancient, times, those, who, were, frail, were, seen, as, a, burden, and, ignored, or, in, extreme, cases, killed, 6, people, were, defined, as, old, because, of, their, inability, to, perform, useful, tasks, rather, than, their, years, 6, although, he, was, skeptical, of, the, gods, aristotle, concurred, in, the, dislike, of, old, people, in, his, ethics, he, wrote, that, old, people, are, miserly, they, do, not, acknowledge, disinterested, friendship, only, seeking, for, what, can, satisfy, their, selfish, needs, 60, the, medieval, and, renaissance, periods, depicted, old, age, as, cruel, or, weak, 7, the, 16th, century, utopians, thomas, more, and, antonio, de, guevara, allowed, no, decrepit, old, people, in, their, fictional, lands, 277, 8, 280, for, thomas, more, on, the, island, of, utopia, when, people, are, so, old, as, to, have, out, lived, themselves, and, are, terminally, ill, in, pain, and, a, burden, to, everyone, the, priests, exhort, them, about, choosing, to, die, the, priests, assure, them, that, they, shall, be, happy, after, death, if, they, choose, to, die, they, end, their, lives, by, starvation, or, by, taking, opium, antonio, de, guevara, s, utopian, nation, had, a, custom, not, to, live, longer, than, sixty, five, years, at, that, age, they, practiced, self, immolation, rather, than, condemn, the, practice, bishop, guevara, called, it, a, golden, world, in, which, people, have, overcome, the, natural, appetite, to, desire, to, live, in, the, modern, period, the, cultural, status, of, old, people, has, declined, in, many, cultures, 7, joan, erikson, observed, that, aged, individuals, are, often, ostracized, neglected, and, overlooked, elders, are, seen, no, longer, as, bearers, of, wisdom, but, as, embodiments, of, shame, 114, attitudes, toward, old, age, well, being, vary, somewhat, between, cultures, for, example, in, the, united, states, being, healthy, physically, and, socially, active, are, signs, of, a, good, old, age, on, the, other, hand, africans, focus, more, on, food, and, material, security, and, a, helpful, family, when, describing, old, age, well, being, additionally, koreans, are, more, anxious, about, aging, and, more, scared, of, old, people, than, americans, are, research, on, age, related, attitudes, consistently, finds, that, negative, attitudes, exceed, positive, attitudes, toward, old, people, because, of, their, looks, and, behavior, in, his, study, aging, and, old, age, posner, discovers, resentment, and, disdain, of, older, people, in, american, society, 320, harvard, university, s, implicit, association, test, measures, implicit, attitudes, and, beliefs, about, young, vis, a, vis, old, blind, spot, hidden, biases, of, good, people, a, book, about, the, test, reports, that, 80, of, americans, have, an, automatic, preference, for, the, young, over, old, and, that, attitude, is, true, worldwide, the, young, are, consistent, in, their, negative, attitude, toward, the, old, ageism, documents, that, americans, generally, have, little, tolerance, for, older, persons, and, very, few, reservations, about, harboring, negative, attitudes, about, them, despite, its, prevalence, ageism, is, seldom, the, subject, of, public, discourse, 23, simone, de, beauvoir, wrote, that, there, is, one, form, of, experience, that, belongs, only, to, those, that, are, old, that, of, old, age, itself, nevertheless, simulations, of, old, age, attempt, to, help, younger, people, gain, some, understanding, texas, a, m, university, offers, a, plan, for, an, aging, simulation, workshop, the, workshop, is, adapted, from, sensitizing, people, to, the, processes, of, aging, some, of, the, simulations, include, the, macklin, intergenerational, institute, conducts, xtreme, aging, workshops, as, depicted, in, the, new, york, times, a, condensed, version, was, presented, on, nbc, s, today, show, and, is, available, online, one, exercise, was, to, lay, out, 3, sets, of, 5, slips, of, paper, on, set, 1, write, your, 5, most, enjoyed, activities, on, set, 2, write, your, 5, most, valued, possessions, on, set, 3, write, your, 5, most, loved, people, then, lose, them, one, by, one, trying, to, feel, each, loss, until, you, have, lost, them, all, as, happens, in, old, age, most, people, in, the, age, range, of, 65, 79, the, years, of, retirement, and, early, old, age, enjoy, rich, possibilities, for, a, full, life, but, the, condition, of, frailty, distinguished, by, bodily, failure, and, greater, dependence, becomes, increasingly, common, from, around, age, 80, in, the, united, states, hospital, discharge, data, from, 2003, to, 2011, shows, that, injury, was, the, most, common, reason, for, hospitalization, among, patients, aged, 65, gerontologists, note, the, lack, of, research, regarding, and, the, difficulty, in, defining, frailty, however, they, add, that, physicians, recognize, frailty, when, they, see, it, xxi, 4, 6, a, group, of, geriatricians, proposed, a, general, definition, of, frailty, as, a, physical, state, of, increased, vulnerability, to, stressors, that, results, from, decreased, reserves, and, disregulation, in, multiple, physiological, systems, 20, frailty, is, a, common, condition, in, later, old, age, but, different, definitions, of, frailty, produce, diverse, assessments, of, prevalence, one, study, placed, the, incidence, of, frailty, for, ages, 65, at, 10, 7, another, study, placed, the, incidence, of, frailty, in, age, 65, population, at, 22, for, women, and, 15, for, men, 106, a, canadian, study, illustrated, how, frailty, increases, with, age, and, calculated, the, prevalence, for, 65, as, 22, 4, and, for, 85, as, 43, 7, a, worldwide, study, of, patterns, of, frailty, based, on, data, from, 20, nations, found, a, a, consistent, correlation, between, frailty, and, age, b, a, higher, frequency, among, women, and, c, more, frailty, in, wealthier, nations, where, greater, support, and, medical, care, increases, longevity, in, norway, a, 20, year, longitudinal, study, of, 400, people, found, that, bodily, failure, and, greater, dependence, became, prevalent, in, the, 80, years, the, study, calls, these, years, the, fourth, age, or, old, age, in, the, real, meaning, of, the, term, similarly, the, berlin, aging, study, rated, overall, functionality, on, four, levels, good, medium, poor, and, very, poor, people, in, their, 70s, were, mostly, rated, good, in, the, 80, 90, year, range, the, four, levels, of, functionality, were, divided, equally, by, the, 90, 100, year, range, 60, would, be, considered, frail, because, of, very, poor, functionality, and, only, 5, still, possessed, good, functionality, see, also, dna, damage, theory, of, aging, three, unique, markers, of, frailty, have, been, proposed, a, loss, of, any, notion, of, invincibility, b, loss, of, ability, to, do, things, essential, to, one, s, care, and, c, loss, of, possibility, for, a, subsequent, life, stage, old, age, survivors, on, average, deteriorate, from, agility, in, their, early, retirement, years, 65, 79, to, a, period, of, frailty, preceding, death, this, deterioration, is, gradual, for, some, and, precipitous, for, others, frailty, is, marked, by, an, array, of, chronic, physical, and, mental, problems, which, means, that, frailty, is, not, treatable, as, a, specific, disease, these, problems, coupled, with, increased, dependency, in, the, basic, activities, of, daily, living, adls, required, for, personal, care, add, emotional, problems, depression, and, anxiety, in, sum, frailty, has, been, depicted, as, a, group, of, complex, issues, distinct, but, causally, interconnected, that, often, include, comorbid, diseases, progressive, weakness, stress, exhaustion, and, depression, 25, 6, healthy, humans, after, age, 50, accumulate, endogenous, dna, single, and, double, strand, breaks, in, a, linear, fashion, in, cellular, dna, other, forms, of, dna, damage, also, increase, with, age, after, age, 50, a, decline, in, dna, repair, capability, also, occurs, these, findings, are, in, accord, with, the, theory, that, dna, damage, is, a, fundamental, aspect, of, aging, in, older, people, frail, people, require, a, high, level, of, care, medical, advances, have, made, it, possible, to, extend, life, or, postpone, death, at, old, age, for, years, this, added, time, costs, many, frail, people, prolonged, sickness, dependence, pain, and, suffering, 9, according, to, a, study, by, the, agency, for, healthcare, research, and, quality, ahrq, the, rate, of, emergency, department, visits, was, consistently, highest, among, patients, ages, 85, years, and, older, in, 2006, 2011, in, the, united, states, additionally, patients, aged, 65, had, the, highest, percentage, of, hospital, stays, for, adults, with, multiple, chronic, conditions, but, the, second, highest, percentage, of, hospital, costs, in, 2003, 2014, these, final, years, are, also, costly, in, economic, terms, 17, 8, 92, one, out, of, every, four, medicare, dollars, is, spent, on, the, frail, in, their, last, year, of, life, in, attempts, to, postpone, death, medical, treatments, in, the, final, days, are, not, only, economically, costly, they, are, often, unnecessary, or, even, harmful, nortin, hadler, m, d, warns, against, the, tendency, to, medicalize, and, overtreat, the, frail, in, her, choosing, medical, care, in, old, age, michael, r, gillick, m, d, argues, that, appropriate, medical, treatment, for, the, frail, is, not, the, same, as, for, the, robust, the, frail, are, vulnerable, to, being, tipped, over, by, any, physical, stress, put, on,

7, almost, 20, of, the, people, wanted, to, use, whatever, treatment, that, might, postpone, death, about, the, same, number, said, that, given, a, terminal, illness, they, would, choose, assisted, suicide, roughly, half, chose, doing, nothing, except, live, day, by, day, until, death, comes, naturally, without, medical, or, other, intervention, designed, to, prolong, life, this, choice, was, coupled, with, a, desire, to, receive, palliative, care, if, needed, 6, 7, 9, 12, 32, about, half, of, older, adults, have, multimorbidity, that, is, they, have, three, or, more, chronic, conditions, medical, advances, have, made, it, possible, to, postpone, death, but, in, many, cases, this, postponement, adds, prolonged, sickness, dependence, pain, and, suffering, a, time, that, is, costly, in, social, psychological, and, economic, terms, 18, 72, the, longitudinal, interviews, of, 150, age, 85, people, summarized, in, life, beyond, 85, years, found, progressive, terminal, decline, in, the,

feet, 202, 7, the, study, of, older, adults, views, on, death, found, that, the, more, frail, people, were, the, more, pain, suffering, and, struggles, they, were, enduring, the, more, likely, they, were, to, accept, and, welcome, death, as, a, release, from, their, misery, their, fear, about, the, process, of, dying, was, that, it, would, prolong, their, distress, besides, being, a, release, from, misery, some, saw, death, as, a, way, to, reunite, with, deceased, loved, ones, others, saw, death, as, a, way, to, free, their, caretakers, from, the, burden, of, their, care, 55, 270, 276,

countries, life, expectancy, and, thus, the, old, age, population, have, increased, consistently, over, the, last, decades, in, the, united, states, the, proportion, of, people, aged, 65, or, older, increased, from, 4, in, 1900, to, about, 12, in, 2000, in, 1900, only, about, 3, million, of, the, nation, s, citizens, were, 65, or, older, out, of, 76, million, total, american, citizens, by, 2000, the, number, of, senior, citizens, had, increased, to, about, 35, million, of, 280, million, us, citizens, population, experts, estimate, that, more, than, 50, million, americans, about, 17, percent, of, the, population, will, be, 65, or, older, in, 2020, by, 2050, it, is, projected, that, at, least, 400, 000, americans, will, be, 100, or, older, the, number, of, old, people, is, growing, around, the, world, chiefly, because, of, the, post, world, war, ii, baby, boom, and, increases, in, the, provision, and, standards, of, health, care, by, 2050, 33, of, the, developed, world, s, population, and, almost, 20, of, the, less, developed, world, s, population, will, be, over, 60, years, old, the, growing, number, of, people, living, to, their, 80s, and, 90s, in, the, developed, world, has, strained, public, welfare, systems, and, has, also, resulted, in, increased, incidence, of, diseases, like, cancer, and, dementia, that, were, rarely, seen, in, premodern, times, when, the, united, states, social, security, program, was, created, people, older, than, 65, numbered, only, around, 5, of, the, population, and, the, average, life, expectancy, of, a, 65, year, old, in, 1936, was, approximately, 5, years, while, in, 2011, it, could, often, range, from, 10, to, 20, years, other, issues, that, can, arise, from, an, increasing, population, are, growing, demands, for, health, care, and, an, increase, in, demand, for, different, types, of, services, of, the, roughly, 150, 000, people, who, die, each, day, across, the, globe, about, two, thirds, 100, 000, per, day, die, of, age, related, causes, in, industrialized, nations, the, proportion, is, much, higher, reaching, 90, according, to, erik, erikson, s, stages, of, psychosocial, development, the, human, personality, is, developed, in, a, series, of, eight, stages, that, take, place, from, the, time, of, birth, and, continue, on, throughout, an, individual, s, complete, life, he, characterises, old, age, as, a, period, of, integrity, vs, despair, during, which, people, focus, on, reflecting, back, on, their, lives, those, who, are, unsuccessful, during, this, phase, will, feel, that, their, life, has, been, wasted, and, will, experience, many, regrets, the, individual, will, be, left, with, feelings, of, bitterness, and, despair, those, who, feel, proud, of, their, accomplishments, will, feel, a, sense, of, integrity, successfully, completing, this, phase, means, looking, back, with, few, regrets, and, a, general, feeling, of, satisfaction, these, individuals, will, attain, wisdom, even, when, confronting, death, coping, is, a, very, important, skill, needed, in, the, aging, process, to, move, forward, with, life, and, not, be, stuck, in, the, past, the, way, people, adapt, and, cope, reflects, their, aging, process, on, a, psycho, social, level, for, people, in, their, 80s, and, 90s, joan, erikson, added, a, ninth, stage, in, the, life, cycle, completed, extended, version, as, she, wrote, she, added, the, ninth, stage, because, the, integrity, of, the, eighth, stage, imposes, a, serious, demand, on, the, senses, of, elders, and, the, wisdom, of, the, eighth, stage, requires, capacities, that, ninth, stage, elders, do, not, usually, have, 112, 3, newman, newman, also, proposed, a, ninth, stage, of, life, elderhood, elderhood, refers, to, those, individuals, who, live, past, the, life, expectancy, of, their, birth, cohorts, they, described, two, different, types, of, people, in, this, stage, of, life, the, young, old, are, the, healthy, individuals, who, can, function, on, their, own, without, assistance, and, can, complete, their, daily, tasks, independently, while, the, old, old, are, those, who, depend, on, specific, services, due, to, declining, health, or, diseases, social, theories, or, concepts, propose, explanations, for, the, distinctive, relationships, between, old, people, and, their, societies, one, theory, proposed, in, 1961, is, the, disengagement, theory, which, proposes, that, in, old, age, a, mutual, disengagement, between, people, and, their, society, occurs, in, anticipation, of, death, by, becoming, disengaged, from, work, and, family, responsibilities, according, to, this, concept, people, are, enabled, to, enjoy, their, old, age, without, stress, this, theory, has, been, subjected, to, the, criticism, that, old, age, disengagement, is, neither, natural, inevitable, nor, beneficial, furthermore, disengaging, from, social, ties, in, old, age, is, not, across, the, board, unsatisfactory, ties, are, dropped, and, satisfying, ones, kept, 613, in, opposition, to, the, disengagement, theory, the, activity, theory, of, old, age, argues, that, disengagement, in, old, age, occurs, not, by, desire, but, by, the, barriers, to, social, engagement, imposed, by, society, this, theory, has, been, faulted, for, not, factoring, in, psychological, changes, that, occur, in, old, age, as, shown, by, reduced, activity, even, when, available, it, has, also, been, found, that, happiness, in, old, age, is, not, proportional, to, activity, 614, according, to, the, continuity, theory, in, spite, of, the, inevitable, differences, imposed, by, their, old, age, most, people, try, to, maintain, continuity, in, personhood, activities, and, relationships, with, their, younger, days, 614, socioemotional, selectivity, theory, also, depicts, how, people, maintain, continuity, in, old, age, the, focus, of, this, theory, is, continuity, sustained, by, social, networks, albeit, networks, narrowed, by, choice, and, by, circumstances, the, choice, is, for, more, harmonious, relationships, the, circumstances, are, loss, of, relationships, by, death, and, distance, 614, 5, life, expectancy, by, nation, at, birth, in, the, year, 2011, ranged, from, 48, years, to, 82, years, low, values, generally, indicate, high, death, rates, for, infants, and, children, in, most, parts, of, the, world, women, on, average, live, longer, than, men, even, so, the, disparities, vary, between, 12, years, in, russia, to, no, difference, or, higher, life, expectancy, for, men, in, countries, such, as, zimbabwe, and, uganda, the, number, of, elderly, people, worldwide, began, to, surge, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, developed, countries, before, then, five, or, less, percent, of, the, population, was, over, 65, few, lived, longer, than, their, 70s, and, people, who, attained, advanced, age, i, e, their, 80s, were, rare, enough, to, be, a, novelty, and, were, revered, as, wise, sages, the, worldwide, over, 65, population, in, 1960, was, one, third, of, the, under, 5, population, by, 2013, the, over, 65, population, had, grown, to, equal, the, under, 5, population, and, is, projected, to, double, the, under, 5, population, by, 2050, before, the, surge, in, the, over, 65, population, accidents, and, disease, claimed, many, people, before, they, could, attain, old, age, and, health, problems, in, those, over, 65, meant, a, quick, death, in, most, cases, if, a, person, lived, to, an, advanced, age, it, was, generally, due, to, genetic, factors, and, or, a, relatively, easy, lifestyle, since, diseases, of, old, age, could, not, be, treated, before, the, 20th, century, in, october, 2016, a, group, of, scientists, identified, the, maximum, human, lifespan, at, an, average, age, of, 115, with, an, absolute, upper, limit, of, 125, years, however, the, concept, of, a, maximum, lifespan, of, humans, is, still, widely, debated, among, the, scientific, community, german,

became, eligible, for, full, social, security, benefits, began, to, increase, gradually, and, will, continue, to, do, so, until, it, reaches, 67, in, 2027, full, retirement, age, for, social, security, benefits, for, people, retiring, in, 2012, is, age, 66, in, the, united, kingdom, the, state, pension, age, for, men, and, women, will, rise, to, 66, in, 2020, with, further, increases, scheduled, after, that, originally, the, purpose, of, old, age, pensions, was, to, prevent, elderly, people, from, being, reduced, to, beggary, which, is, still, common, in, some, underdeveloped, countries, but, growing, life, expectancies, and, older, populations, have, brought, into, question, the, model, under, which, pension, systems, were, designed, by, 1990, the, united, states, was, spending, 30, per, cent, of, its, budget, on, the, elderly, compared, with, 2, per, cent, on, education, the, dominant, perception, of, the, american, old, age, population, changed, from, needy, and, worthy, to, powerful, and, greedy, old, people, getting, more, than, their, share, of, the, nation, s, resources, however, in, 2011, using, a, supplemental, poverty, measure, spm, the, old, age, american, poverty, rate, was, measured, as, 15, 9, in, the, united, states, in, 2008, 11, million, people, aged, 65, lived, alone, 5, million, or, 22, of, ages, 65, 74, 4, million, or, 34, of, ages,

utensils, for, people, with, paralysis, or, hand, weakness, a, swedish, study, found, that, at, age, 76, 46, of, the, subjects, used, assistive, devices, when, they, reached, age, 86, 69, used, them, the, subjects, were, ambivalent, regarding, the, use, of, the, assistive, devices, as, enablers, or, as, disablers, people, who, view, assistive, devices, as, enabling, greater, independence, accept, and, use, them, whereas, those, who, see, them, as, symbols, of, disability, reject, them, however, organizations, like, love, for, the, elderly, aim, to, combat, such, age, related, prejudice, by,
