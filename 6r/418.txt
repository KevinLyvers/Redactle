remained, strong, since, okinawans, were, banned, from, carrying, swords, under, samurai, rule, clandestine, groups, of, young, aristocrats, created, unarmed, combat, methods, as, a, form, of, resistance, combining, local, and, chinese, styles, this, blend, of, martial, arts, became, known, as, kara, te, which, translates, to, chinese, hand, initially, there, were, no, uniforms, colored, belts, ranking, systems, or, standardized, styles, training, emphasized, self, discipline, many, elements, essential, to, karate, were, actually, incorporated, a, century, ago, the, ryukyu, kingdom, had, been, conquered, by, the, japanese, satsuma, domain, and, had, become, its, vassal, state, since, 1609, but, was, formally, annexed, to, the, empire, of, japan, in, 1879, as, okinawa, prefecture, the, ryukyuan, samurai, okinawan, samur, who, had, been, the, bearers, of, karate, lost, their, privileged, position, and, with, it, karate, was, in, danger, of, losing, transmission, however, karate, gradually, regained, popularity, after, 1905, when, it, began, to, be, taught, in, schools, in, okinawa, during, the, taish, era, 1912, 1926, karate, was, introduced, to, mainland, japan, by, gichin, funakoshi, and, motobu, ch, ki, the, ultranationalistic, sentiment, of, the, 1930s, affected, every, aspect, of, japanese, culture, to, make, the, imported, martial, art, more, relatable, funakoshi, incorporated, elements, from, judo, such, as, the, training, uniforms, colored, belts, and, ranking, systems, karate, s, popularity, was, initially, sluggish, with, little, exposition, but, when, a, magazine, reported, a, story, about, motobu, defeating, a, foreign, boxer, in, kyoto, karate, rapidly, became, well, known, throughout, japan, in, this, era, of, escalating, japanese, militarism, the, name, was, changed, from, chinese, hand, or, tang, hand, to, empty, hand, both, of, which, are, pronounced, karate, in, japanese, to, indicate, that, the, japanese, wished, to, develop, the, combat, form, in, japanese, style, after, world, war, ii, okinawa, became, 1945, an, important, united, states, military, site, and, karate, became, popular, among, servicemen, stationed, there, the, martial, arts, movies, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, served, to, greatly, increase, the, popularity, of, martial, arts, around, the, world, and, english, speakers, began, to, use, the, word, karate, in, a, generic, way, to, refer, to, all, striking, based, asian, martial, arts, karate, schools, d, j, s, began, appearing, around, the, world, catering, to, those, with, casual, interest, as, well, as, those, seeking, a, deeper, study, of, the, art, karate, like, other, japanese, martial, arts, is, considered, to, be, not, only, about, fighting, techniques, but, also, about, spiritual, cultivation, many, karate, schools, and, d, j, s, have, established, rules, called, d, j, kun, which, emphasize, the, perfection, of, character, the, importance, of, effort, and, respect, for, courtesy, karate, featured, at, the, 2020, summer, olympics, after, its, inclusion, at, the, games, was, supported, by, the, international, olympic, committee, web, japan, sponsored, by, the, japanese, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, claims, that, karate, has, 50, million, practitioners, worldwide, while, the, world, karate, federation, claims, there, are, 100, million, practitioners, around, the, world, originally, in, okinawa, during, the, ryukyu, kingdom, period, there, existed, an, indigenous, ryukyuan, martial, art, called, te, okinawan, t, lit, hand, furthermore, in, the, 19th, century, a, chinese, derived, martial, art, called, t, de, okinawan, t, d, lit, tang, hand, emerged, according, to, gichin, funakoshi, a, distinction, between, okinawan, te, and, t, de, existed, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, emergence, of, t, de, it, is, thought, that, te, also, came, to, be, called, okinawa, te, okinawan, uchin, d, lit, okinawa, hand, however, this, distinction, gradually, became, blurred, with, the, decline, of, okinawa, te, around, 1905, when, karate, began, to, be, taught, in, public, schools, in, okinawa, t, de, was, read, kun, yomi, and, called, karate, lit, tang, hand, in, the, japanese, style, both, t, de, and, karate, are, written, in, the, same, chinese, characters, meaning, tang, china, hand, but, the, former, is, on, yomi, chinese, reading, and, the, latter, is, kun, yomi, japanese, reading, since, the, distinction, between, okinawa, te, and, t, de, was, already, blurred, at, that, time, karate, was, used, to, encompass, both, kara, is, a, kun, yomi, for, the, character, t, in, on, yomi, which, is, derived, from, gaya, confederacy, and, later, included, things, deriving, from, china, specifically, from, the, tang, dynasty, therefore, t, de, and, karate, tang, hand, differ, in, the, scope, of, meaning, of, the, words, japan, sent, envoys, to, the, tang, dynasty, and, introduced, much, chinese, culture, gichin, funakoshi, proposed, that, t, de, karate, may, have, been, used, instead, of, te, as, tang, became, a, synonym, for, luxury, imported, goods, according, to, gichin, funakoshi, the, word, pronounced, karate, existed, in, the, ryukyu, kingdom, period, but, it, is, unclear, whether, it, meant, tang, hand, or, empty, hand, the, chinese, origins, of, karate, were, increasingly, viewed, with, suspicion, due, to, rising, tensions, between, china, and, japan, and, as, well, as, the, looming, threat, of, a, full, scale, war, between, the, two, countries, in, 1933, the, japanese, character, for, karate, was, altered, to, a, homophone, a, word, pronounced, identically, but, with, a, different, meaning, thus, chinese, hand, was, replaced, with, empty, hand, but, this, name, change, did, not, immediately, spread, among, okinawan, karate, practitioners, there, were, many, karate, practitioners, such, as, ch, jun, miyagi, who, still, used, te, in, everyday, conversation, until, world, war, ii, when, karate, was, first, taught, in, mainland, japan, in, the, 1920s, gichin, funakoshi, and, motobu, ch, ki, used, the, name, karate, jutsu, lit, tang, hand, art, along, with, karate, the, word, jutsu, means, art, or, technique, and, in, those, days, it, was, often, used, as, a, suffix, to, the, name, of, each, martial, art, as, in, jujutsu, and, kenjutsu, swordsmanship, the, first, documented, use, of, a, homophone, of, the, logogram, pronounced, kara, by, replacing, the, chinese, character, meaning, tang, dynasty, with, the, character, meaning, empty, took, place, in, karate, kumite, written, in, august, 1905, by, ch, mo, hanashiro, 1869, 1945, in, mainland, japan, karate, empty, hand, gradually, began, to, be, used, from, the, writings, of, gichin, funakoshi, and, motobu, ch, ki, in, the, 1920s, in, 1929, the, karate, study, group, of, keio, university, instructor, gichin, funakoshi, used, this, term, in, reference, to, the, concept, of, emptiness, in, the, heart, sutra, and, this, terminology, was, later, popularized, especially, in, tokyo, there, is, also, a, theory, that, the, background, for, this, name, change, was, the, worsening, of, japan, china, relations, at, the, time, on, 25, october, 1936, a, roundtable, meeting, of, karate, masters, was, held, in, naha, okinawa, prefecture, and, it, was, officially, resolved, to, use, the, name, karate, empty, hand, in, the, sense, of, k, shu, k, ken, lit, without, anything, in, the, hands, or, fists, to, commemorate, this, day, the, okinawa, prefectural, assembly, passed, a, resolution, in, 2005, to, decide, 25, october, as, karate, day, another, nominal, development, is, the, addition, of, d, to, the, end, of, the, word, karate, d, is, a, suffix, having, numerous, meanings, including, road, path, route, and, way, it, is, used, in, many, martial, arts, that, survived, japan, s, transition, from, feudal, culture, to, modern, times, it, implies, that, these, arts, are, not, just, fighting, systems, but, contain, spiritual, elements, when, promoted, as, disciplines, in, this, context, d, is, usually, translated, as, the, way, of, examples, include, aikido, judo, ky, d, and, kendo, thus, karated, is, more, than, just, empty, hand, techniques, it, is, the, way, of, the, empty, hand, since, the, 1980s, the, term, karate, has, been, written, in, katakana, instead, of, chinese, characters, mainly, by, kyokushin, karate, founder, masutatsu, oyama, in, japan, katakana, is, mainly, used, for, foreign, words, giving, kyokushin, karate, a, modern, and, new, impression, there, are, several, theories, regarding, the, origins, of, karate, but, the, main, ones, are, as, follows, in, okinawa, there, was, an, ancient, martial, dance, called, m, kata, the, dancers, danced, to, the, accompaniment, of, songs, and, sanshin, music, similar, to, karate, kata, in, the, okinawan, countryside, m, kata, remained, until, the, early, 20th, century, there, is, a, theory, that, from, this, m, kata, with, martial, elements, te, okinawan, t, hand, was, born, and, developed, into, karate, this, theory, is, advocated, by, ank, asato, and, his, student, gichin, funakoshi, it, is, said, that, in, 1392, a, group, of, professional, people, known, as, the, thirty, six, families, from, min, migrated, to, kume, village, now, kume, naha, city, in, naha, from, fujian, province, in, the, ming, dynasty, at, that, time, they, brought, with, them, advanced, learning, and, skills, to, ryukyu, and, there, is, a, theory, that, chinese, kenp, the, origin, of, karate, was, also, brought, to, ryukyu, at, this, time, there, is, also, the, keich, import, theory, which, states, that, karate, was, brought, to, ryukyu, after, the, invasion, of, ryukyu, by, the, satsuma, domain, keich, 14, 1609, as, well, as, the, theory, that, it, was, introduced, by, k, sh, kun, okinawan, k, sank, based, on, the, description, in, shima, writing, there, are, also, other, theories, such, as, that, it, developed, from, okinawan, sumo, shima, or, that, it, originated, from, jujutsu, which, had, been, introduced, from, japan, the, reason, for, the, development, of, unarmed, combat, techniques, in, ryukyu, has, conventionally, been, attributed, to, a, policy, of, banning, weapons, which, is, said, to, have, been, implemented, on, two, occasions, the, first, was, during, the, reign, of, king, sh, shin, 1476, 1526, r, 1477, 1527, when, weapons, were, collected, from, all, over, the, country, and, strictly, controlled, by, the, royal, government, the, second, time, was, after, the, invasion, of, ryukyu, by, the, satsuma, domain, in, 1609, through, the, two, policies, the, popular, belief, that, ryukyuan, samurai, who, were, deprived, of, their, weapons, developed, karate, to, compete, with, satsuma, s, samurai, has, traditionally, been, referred, to, as, if, it, were, a, historical, fact, but, in, recent, years, many, researchers, have, questioned, the, causal, relationship, between, the, policy, of, banning, weapons, and, the, development, of, karate, for, example, as, the, basis, for, king, sh, shin, s, policy, of, banning, weapons, an, inscription, on, the, parapet, of, the, main, hall, of, shuri, castle, 1509, which, states, that, swords, bows, and, arrows, are, to, be, piled, up, exclusively, as, weapons, of, national, defense, has, been, conventionally, interpreted, as, meaning, weapons, were, collected, and, sealed, in, a, warehouse, however, in, recent, years, researchers, of, okinawan, studies, have, pointed, out, that, the, correct, interpretation, is, that, swords, bows, and, arrows, were, collected, and, used, as, weapons, of, the, state, it, is, also, known, that, the, policy, of, banning, weapons, a, 1613, notice, to, the, ryukyu, royal, government, which, is, said, to, have, been, implemented, by, the, satsuma, domain, only, prohibited, the, carrying, of, swords, and, other, weapons, but, not, their, possession, and, was, a, relatively, lax, regulation, this, notice, stated, 1, the, possession, of, guns, is, prohibited, 2, the, possession, of, weapons, owned, privately, by, princes, three, magistrates, and, samurai, is, permitted, 3, weapons, must, be, repaired, in, satsuma, through, the, magistrate, s, office, of, satsuma, 4, swords, must, be, reported, to, the, magistrate, s, office, of, satsuma, for, approval, it, did, not, prohibit, the, possession, of, weapons, except, guns, or, even, their, practice, in, fact, even, after, subjugation, to, the, satsuma, domain, a, number, of, ryukyuan, masters, of, swordsmanship, spearmanship, archery, and, other, arts, are, known, therefore, some, researchers, criticize, the, theory, that, karate, developed, due, to, the, policy, of, banning, weapons, as, a, rumor, on, the, street, with, no, basis, at, all, karate, began, as, a, common, fighting, system, known, as, te, okinawan, t, among, the, ryukyuan, samurai, class, there, were, few, formal, styles, of, te, but, rather, many, practitioners, with, their, own, methods, one, surviving, example, is, motobu, udund, lit, motobu, palace, hand, which, has, been, handed, down, to, this, day, in, the, motobu, family, one, of, the, branches, of, the, former, ryukyu, royal, family, in, the, 16th, century, the, ryukyuan, history, book, ky, y, established, around, 1745, mentions, that, ky, ahagon, jikki, a, favored, retainer, of, king, sh, shin, used, a, martial, art, called, karate, lit, empty, hand, to, smash, both, legs, of, an, assassin, this, karate, is, thought, to, refer, to, te, not, today, s, karate, and, ank, asato, introduces, ky, ahagon, as, a, prominent, martial, artist, however, some, believe, that, ky, ahagon, s, anecdote, is, a, half, legend, and, that, it, is, unclear, whether, he, was, actually, a, te, master, in, the, 18th, century, the, names, of, nishinda, u, kata, gushikawa, u, kata, and, ch, ken, makabe, are, known, as, masters, of, te, nishinda, u, kata, and, gushikawa, u, kata, were, martial, artists, active, during, the, reign, of, king, sh, kei, reigned, 1713, 1751, nishinda, u, kata, was, good, at, spear, as, well, as, te, and, gushikawa, u, kata, was, also, good, at, wooden, sword, swordsmanship, ch, ken, makabe, was, a, man, of, the, late, 18th, century, his, light, stature, and, jumping, ability, gave, him, the, nickname, makabe, ch, n, gw, lit, little, fighting, cock, as, he, was, like, a, ch, n, fighting, cock, the, ceiling, of, his, house, is, said, to, have, been, marked, by, his, kicking, foot, it, is, known, that, in, shima, writing, 1762, written, by, yoshihiro, tobe, a, confucian, scholar, of, the, tosa, domain, who, interviewed, ryukyuan, samurai, who, had, drifted, to, tosa, present, day, k, chi, prefecture, there, is, a, description, of, a, martial, art, called, kumiai, jutsu, performed, by, k, sh, kun, okinawan, k, sank, it, is, believed, that, k, sh, kun, may, have, been, a, military, officer, on, a, mission, from, qing, that, visited, ryukyu, in, 1756, and, some, believe, that, karate, originated, with, k, sh, kun, in, addition, the, will, part, i, 1778, part, ii, 1783, of, ryukyuan, samurai, aka, p, chin, chokushki, 1721, 1784, mentions, the, name, of, a, martial, art, called, karamut, along, with, japanese, jigen, ry, swordsmanship, and, jujutsu, indicating, that, ryukyuan, samurai, practiced, these, arts, in, the, 18th, century, in, 1609, the, japanese, satsuma, domain, invaded, ryukyu, and, ryukyu, became, its, vassal, state, but, it, continued, to, pay, tribute, to, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, in, china, at, the, time, china, had, implemented, a, policy, of, sea, ban, and, only, traded, with, tributary, countries, so, the, satsuma, domain, wanted, ryukyu, to, continue, its, tribute, to, benefit, from, it, the, envoys, of, the, tribute, mission, were, chosen, from, among, the, samurai, class, of, ryukyu, and, they, went, to, fuzhou, in, fujian, and, stayed, there, for, six, months, to, a, year, and, a, half, government, funded, and, privately, funded, foreign, students, were, also, sent, to, study, in, beijing, or, fuzhou, for, several, years, some, of, these, envoys, and, students, studied, chinese, martial, arts, in, china, the, styles, of, chinese, martial, arts, they, studied, are, not, known, for, certain, but, it, is, assumed, that, they, studied, fujian, white, crane, and, other, styles, from, fujian, province, s, ryo, ts, shin, monk, ts, shin, active, during, the, reign, of, king, sh, kei, was, a, monk, who, went, to, the, qing, dynasty, to, study, chinese, martial, arts, and, was, reportedly, one, of, the, best, martial, artists, of, his, time, in, ryukyu, it, is, not, known, when, the, name, t, de, lit, tang, hand, first, came, into, use, in, the, ryukyu, kingdom, but, according, to, ank, asato, it, was, popularized, from, kanga, sakugawa, 1786, 1867, who, was, nicknamed, t, de, sakugawa, sakugawa, was, a, samurai, from, shuri, who, traveled, to, qing, china, to, learn, chinese, martial, arts, the, martial, arts, he, mastered, were, new, and, different, from, te, as, t, de, was, spread, by, sakugawa, traditional, te, became, distinguished, as, okinawa, te, lit, okinawa, hand, and, gradually, faded, away, as, it, merged, with, t, de, it, is, generally, believed, that, today, s, karate, is, a, result, of, the, synthesis, of, te, okinawa, te, and, t, de, funakoshi, writes, in, the, early, modern, era, when, china, was, highly, revered, many, martial, artists, traveled, to, china, to, practice, chinese, kenpo, and, added, it, to, the, ancient, kenpo,
