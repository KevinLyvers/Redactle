bdsm, is, a, variety, of, often, erotic, practices, or, roleplaying, involving, bondage, discipline, dominance, and, submission, sadomasochism, and, other, related, interpersonal, dynamics, given, the, wide, range, of, practices, some, of, which, may, be, engaged, in, by, people, who, do, not, consider, themselves, to, be, practising, bdsm, inclusion, in, the, bdsm, community, or, subculture, often, is, said, to, depend, on, self, identification, and, shared, experience, the, initialism, bdsm, is, first, recorded, in, a, usenet, post, from, 1991, and, is, interpreted, as, a, combination, of, the, abbreviations, b, d, bondage, and, discipline, d, s, dominance, and, submission, and, s, m, sadism, and, masochism, bdsm, is, now, used, as, a, catch, all, phrase, covering, a, wide, range, of, activities, forms, of, interpersonal, relationships, and, distinct, subcultures, bdsm, communities, generally, welcome, anyone, with, a, non, normative, streak, who, identifies, with, the, community, this, may, include, cross, dressers, body, modification, enthusiasts, animal, roleplayers, rubber, fetishists, and, others, activities, and, relationships, in, bdsm, are, often, characterized, by, the, participants, taking, on, roles, that, are, complementary, and, involve, inequality, of, power, thus, the, idea, of, informed, consent, of, both, the, partners, is, essential, the, terms, submissive, and, dominant, are, often, used, to, distinguish, these, roles, the, dominant, partner, dom, takes, psychological, control, over, the, submissive, sub, the, terms, top, and, bottom, are, also, used, the, top, is, the, instigator, of, an, action, while, the, bottom, is, the, receiver, of, the, action, the, two, sets, of, terms, are, subtly, different, for, example, someone, may, choose, to, act, as, bottom, to, another, person, for, example, by, being, whipped, purely, recreationally, without, any, implication, of, being, psychologically, dominated, and, submissives, may, be, ordered, to, massage, their, dominant, partners, although, the, bottom, carries, out, the, action, and, the, top, receives, it, they, have, not, necessarily, switched, roles, the, abbreviations, sub, and, dom, are, frequently, used, instead, of, submissive, and, dominant, sometimes, the, female, specific, terms, mistress, domme, and, dominatrix, are, used, to, describe, a, dominant, woman, instead, of, the, sometimes, gender, neutral, term, dom, individuals, who, change, between, top, dominant, and, bottom, submissive, roles, whether, from, relationship, to, relationship, or, within, a, given, relationship, are, called, switches, the, precise, definition, of, roles, and, self, identification, is, a, common, subject, of, debate, among, bdsm, participants, bdsm, is, an, umbrella, term, for, certain, kinds, of, erotic, behaviour, between, consenting, adults, encompassing, various, subcultures, terms, for, roles, vary, widely, among, the, subcultures, top, and, dominant, are, widely, used, for, those, partner, s, in, the, relationship, or, activity, who, are, respectively, the, physically, active, or, controlling, participants, bottom, and, submissive, are, widely, used, for, those, partner, s, in, the, relationship, or, activity, who, are, respectively, the, physically, receptive, or, controlled, participants, the, interaction, between, tops, and, bottoms, where, physical, or, mental, control, of, the, bottom, is, surrendered, to, the, top, is, sometimes, known, as, power, exchange, whether, in, the, context, of, an, encounter, or, a, relationship, bdsm, actions, can, often, take, place, during, a, specific, period, of, time, agreed, to, by, both, parties, referred, to, as, play, a, scene, or, a, session, participants, usually, derive, pleasure, from, this, even, though, many, of, the, practices, such, as, inflicting, pain, or, humiliation, or, being, restrained, would, be, unpleasant, under, other, circumstances, explicit, sexual, activity, such, as, sexual, penetration, may, occur, within, a, session, but, is, not, essential, for, legal, reasons, such, explicit, sexual, interaction, is, seen, only, rarely, in, public, play, spaces, and, is, sometimes, banned, by, the, rules, of, a, party, or, playspace, whether, it, is, a, public, playspace, ranging, from, a, party, at, an, established, community, dungeon, to, a, hosted, play, zone, at, a, nightclub, or, social, event, the, parameters, of, allowance, can, vary, some, have, a, policy, of, panties, nipple, sticker, for, women, underwear, for, men, and, some, allow, full, nudity, with, explicit, sexual, acts, the, fundamental, principles, for, the, exercise, of, bdsm, require, that, it, be, performed, with, the, informed, consent, of, all, parties, since, the, 1980s, many, practitioners, and, organizations, have, adopted, the, motto, originally, from, the, statement, of, purpose, of, gmsma, a, gay, sm, activist, organization, safe, sane, and, consensual, ssc, which, means, that, everything, is, based, on, safe, activities, that, all, participants, are, of, sufficiently, sound, mind, to, consent, and, that, all, participants, do, consent, mutual, consent, makes, a, clear, legal, and, ethical, distinction, between, bdsm, and, such, crimes, as, sexual, assault, and, domestic, violence, some, bdsm, practitioners, prefer, a, code, of, behaviour, that, differs, from, ssc, described, as, risk, aware, consensual, kink, rack, this, code, shows, a, preference, for, a, style, in, which, the, individual, responsibility, of, the, involved, parties, is, emphasized, more, strongly, with, each, participant, being, responsible, for, their, own, well, being, advocates, of, rack, argue, that, ssc, can, hamper, discussion, of, risk, because, no, activity, is, truly, safe, and, that, discussion, of, even, low, risk, possibilities, is, necessary, for, truly, informed, consent, they, further, argue, that, setting, a, discrete, line, between, safe, and, not, safe, activities, ideologically, denies, consenting, adults, the, right, to, evaluate, risks, versus, rewards, for, themselves, that, some, adults, will, be, drawn, to, certain, activities, regardless, of, the, risk, and, that, bdsm, play, particularly, higher, risk, play, or, edgeplay, should, be, treated, with, the, same, regard, as, extreme, sports, with, both, respect, and, the, demand, that, practitioners, educate, themselves, and, practice, the, higher, risk, activities, to, decrease, risk, rack, may, be, seen, as, focusing, primarily, upon, awareness, and, informed, consent, rather, than, accepted, safe, practices, consent, is, the, most, important, criterion, the, consent, and, compliance, for, a, sadomasochistic, situation, can, be, granted, only, by, people, who, can, judge, the, potential, results, for, their, consent, they, must, have, relevant, information, the, extent, to, which, the, scene, will, go, potential, risks, if, a, safeword, will, be, used, what, that, is, and, so, on, at, hand, and, the, necessary, mental, capacity, to, judge, the, resulting, consent, and, understanding, is, occasionally, summarized, in, a, written, contract, which, is, an, agreement, of, what, can, and, cannot, take, place, bdsm, play, is, usually, structured, such, that, it, is, possible, for, the, consenting, partner, to, withdraw, their, consent, at, any, point, during, a, scene, for, example, by, using, a, safeword, that, was, agreed, on, in, advance, use, of, the, agreed, safeword, or, occasionally, a, safe, symbol, such, as, dropping, a, ball, or, ringing, a, bell, especially, when, speech, is, restricted, is, seen, by, some, as, an, explicit, withdrawal, of, consent, failure, to, honor, a, safeword, is, considered, serious, misconduct, and, could, constitute, a, crime, depending, on, the, relevant, law, since, the, bottom, or, top, has, explicitly, revoked, their, consent, to, any, actions, that, follow, the, use, of, the, safeword, for, other, scenes, particularly, in, established, relationships, a, safeword, may, be, agreed, to, signify, a, warning, this, is, getting, too, intense, rather, than, explicit, withdrawal, of, consent, and, a, few, choose, not, to, use, a, safeword, at, all, the, initialism, bdsm, stands, for, these, terms, replaced, sadomasochism, as, they, more, broadly, cover, bdsm, activities, and, focus, on, the, submissive, roles, instead, of, psychological, pain, the, model, is, only, an, attempt, at, phenomenological, differentiation, individual, tastes, and, preferences, in, the, area, of, human, sexuality, may, overlap, among, these, areas, under, the, initialism, bdsm, these, psychological, and, physiological, facets, are, also, included, the, term, bondage, describes, the, practice, of, physical, restraint, bondage, is, usually, but, not, always, a, sexual, practice, while, bondage, is, a, very, popular, variation, within, the, larger, field, of, bdsm, it, is, nevertheless, sometimes, differentiated, from, the, rest, of, this, field, a, 2015, study, of, over, 1, 000, canadians, showed, that, about, half, of, all, men, held, fantasies, of, bondage, and, almost, half, of, all, women, did, as, well, in, a, strict, sense, bondage, means, binding, the, partner, by, tying, their, appendages, together, for, example, by, the, use, of, handcuffs, or, ropes, or, by, lashing, their, arms, to, an, object, bondage, can, also, be, achieved, by, spreading, the, appendages, and, fastening, them, with, chains, or, ropes, to, a, st, andrew, s, cross, or, spreader, bars, the, term, discipline, describes, psychological, restraining, with, the, use, of, rules, and, punishment, to, control, overt, behaviour, punishment, can, be, pain, caused, physically, such, as, caning, humiliation, caused, psychologically, such, as, a, public, flagellation, or, loss, of, freedom, caused, physically, for, example, chaining, the, submissive, partner, to, the, foot, of, a, bed, another, aspect, is, the, structured, training, of, the, bottom, dominance, and, submission, also, known, as, d, s, ds, or, d, s, is, a, set, of, behaviours, customs, and, rituals, relating, to, the, giving, and, accepting, of, control, of, one, individual, over, another, in, an, erotic, or, lifestyle, context, it, explores, the, more, mental, aspect, of, bdsm, this, is, also, the, case, in, many, relationships, not, considering, themselves, as, sadomasochistic, it, is, considered, to, be, a, part, of, bdsm, if, it, is, practiced, purposefully, the, range, of, its, individual, characteristics, is, thereby, wide, often, bdsm, contracts, are, set, out, in, writing, to, record, the, formal, consent, of, the, parties, to, the, power, exchange, stating, their, common, vision, of, the, relationship, dynamic, the, purpose, of, this, kind, of, agreement, is, primarily, to, encourage, discussion, and, negotiation, in, advance, and, then, to, document, that, understanding, for, the, benefit, of, all, parties, such, documents, have, not, been, recognized, as, being, legally, binding, nor, are, they, intended, to, be, these, agreements, are, binding, in, the, sense, that, the, parties, have, the, expectation, that, the, negotiated, rules, will, be, followed, often, other, friends, and, community, members, may, witness, the, signing, of, such, a, document, in, a, ceremony, and, so, parties, violating, their, agreement, can, result, in, loss, of, face, respect, or, status, with, their, friends, in, the, community, in, general, as, compared, to, conventional, relationships, bdsm, participants, go, to, greater, lengths, to, negotiate, the, important, aspects, of, their, relationships, in, advance, and, to, contribute, significant, effort, toward, learning, about, and, following, safe, practices, in, d, s, the, dominant, is, the, top, and, the, submissive, is, the, bottom, in, s, m, the, sadist, is, usually, the, top, and, the, masochist, the, bottom, but, these, roles, are, frequently, more, complicated, or, jumbled, as, in, the, case, of, being, dominant, masochists, who, may, arrange, for, their, submissive, to, carry, out, s, m, activities, on, them, as, in, b, d, the, declaration, of, the, top, bottom, may, be, required, though, sadomasochists, may, also, play, without, any, power, exchange, at, all, with, both, partners, equally, in, control, of, the, play, the, term, sadomasochism, is, derived, from, the, words, sadism, and, masochism, these, terms, differ, somewhat, from, the, same, terms, used, in, psychology, since, those, require, that, the, sadism, or, masochism, cause, significant, distress, or, involve, non, consenting, partners, sadomasochism, refers, to, the, aspects, of, bdsm, surrounding, the, exchange, of, physical, or, emotional, pain, sadism, describes, sexual, pleasure, derived, by, inflicting, pain, degradation, humiliation, on, another, person, or, causing, another, person, to, suffer, on, the, other, hand, the, masochist, enjoys, being, hurt, humiliated, or, suffering, within, the, consensual, scenario, sadomasochistic, scenes, sometimes, reach, a, level, that, appears, more, extreme, or, cruel, than, other, forms, of, bdsm, for, example, when, a, masochist, is, brought, to, tears, or, is, severely, bruised, and, is, occasionally, unwelcome, at, bdsm, events, or, parties, sadomasochism, does, not, imply, enjoyment, through, causing, or, receiving, pain, in, other, situations, for, example, accidental, injury, medical, procedures, the, terms, sadism, and, masochism, are, derived, from, the, names, of, the, marquis, de, sade, and, leopold, von, sacher, masoch, based, on, the, content, of, the, authors, works, although, the, names, of, de, sade, and, sacher, masoch, are, attached, to, the, terms, sadism, and, masochism, respectively, the, scenes, described, in, de, sade, s, works, do, not, meet, modern, bdsm, standards, of, informed, consent, bdsm, is, solely, based, on, consensual, activities, and, based, on, its, system, and, laws, the, concepts, presented, by, de, sade, are, not, in, accordance, with, the, bdsm, culture, even, though, they, are, sadistic, in, nature, in, 1843, the, ruthenian, physician, heinrich, kaan, published, psychopathia, sexualis, psychopathy, of, sex, a, writing, in, which, he, converts, the, sin, conceptions, of, christianity, into, medical, diagnoses, with, his, work, the, originally, theological, terms, perversion, aberration, and, deviation, became, part, of, the, scientific, terminology, for, the, first, time, the, german, psychiatrist, richard, von, krafft, ebing, introduced, the, terms, sadism, and, masochism, to, the, medical, community, in, his, work, neue, forschungen, auf, dem, gebiet, der, psychopathia, sexualis, new, research, in, the, area, of, psychopathy, of, sex, in, 1890, in, 1905, sigmund, freud, described, sadism, and, masochism, in, his, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, as, diseases, developing, from, an, incorrect, development, of, the, child, psyche, and, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, scientific, perspective, on, the, subject, in, the, following, decades, this, led, to, the, first, time, use, of, the, compound, term, sado, masochism, german, sado, masochismus, by, the, viennese, psychoanalytic, isidor, isaak, sadger, in, their, work, ber, den, sado, masochistischen, komplex, regarding, the, sadomasochistic, complex, in, 1913, in, the, later, 20th, century, bdsm, activists, have, protested, against, these, conceptual, models, as, they, were, derived, from, the, philosophies, of, two, singular, historical, figures, both, freud, and, krafft, ebing, were, psychiatrists, their, observations, on, sadism, and, masochism, were, dependent, on, psychiatric, patients, and, their, models, were, built, on, the, assumption, of, psychopathology, bdsm, activists, argue, that, it, is, illogical, to, attribute, human, behavioural, phenomena, as, complex, as, sadism, and, masochism, to, the, inventions, of, two, historic, individuals, advocates, of, bdsm, have, sought, to, distinguish, themselves, from, widely, held, notions, of, antiquated, psychiatric, theory, by, the, adoption, of, the, term, bdsm, as, a, distinction, from, the, now, common, usage, of, those, psychological, terms, abbreviated, as, s, m, bdsm, is, commonly, mistaken, as, being, all, about, pain, freud, was, confounded, by, the, complexity, and, counterintuitiveness, of, practitioners, doing, things, that, are, self, destructive, and, painful, rather, than, pain, bdsm, practitioners, are, primarily, concerned, with, power, humiliation, and, pleasure, the, aspects, of, d, s, and, b, d, may, not, include, physical, suffering, at, all, but, include, the, sensations, experienced, by, different, emotions, of, the, mind, of, the, three, categories, of, bdsm, only, sadomasochism, specifically, requires, pain, but, this, is, typically, a, means, to, an, end, as, a, vehicle, for, feelings, of, humiliation, dominance, etc, in, psychology, this, aspect, becomes, a, deviant, behaviour, once, the, act, of, inflicting, or, experiencing, pain, becomes, a, substitute, for, or, the, main, source, of, sexual, pleasure, in, its, most, extreme, the, preoccupation, on, this, kind, of, pleasure, can, lead, participants, to, view, humans, as, insensate, means, of, sexual, gratification, dominance, and, submission, of, power, are, an, entirely, different, experience, and, are, not, always, psychologically, associated, with, physical, pain, many, bdsm, activities, involve, no, pain, or, humiliation, but, just, the, exchange, of, power, and, control, during, the, activities, the, participants, may, feel, endorphin, effects, comparable, to, runner, s, high, and, to, the, afterglow, of, orgasm, the, corresponding, trance, like, mental, state, is, also, called, subspace, for, the, submissive, and, domspace, for, the, dominant, some, use, body, stress, to, describe, this, physiological, sensation, the, experience, of, algolagnia, is, important, but, is, not, the, only, motivation, for, many, bdsm, practitioners, the, philosopher, edmund, burke, called, the, sensation, of, pleasure, derived, from, pain, sublime, couples, engaging, in, consensual, bdsm, tend, to, show, hormonal, changes, that, indicate, decreases, in, stress, and, increases, in, emotional, bonding, there, is, an, array, of, bdsm, practitioners, who, take, part, in, sessions, in, which, they, do, not, receive, any, personal, gratification, they, enter, such, situations, solely, with, the, intention, to, allow, their, partners, to, indulge, their, own, needs, or, fetishes, professional, dominants, do, this, in, exchange, for, money, but, non, professionals, do, it, for, the, sake, of, their, partners, in, some, bdsm, sessions, the, top, exposes, the, bottom, to, a, range, of, sensual, experiences, such, as, pinching, biting, scratching, with, fingernails, erotic, spanking, erotic, electrostimulation, and, the, use, of, crops, whips, liquid, wax, ice, cubes, and, wartenberg, wheels, fixation, by, handcuffs, ropes, or, chains, may, occur, the, repertoire, of, possible, toys, is, limited, only, by, the, imagination, of, both, partners, to, some, extent, everyday, items, such, as, clothespins, wooden, spoons, and, plastic, wrap, are, used, in, sex, play, it, is, commonly, considered, that, a, pleasurable, bdsm, experience, during, a, session, depends, strongly, on, the, top, s, competence, and, experience, and, the, bottom, s, physical, and, mental, state, trust, and, sexual, arousal, help, the, partners, enter, a, shared, mindset, following, are, some, of, the, types, of, bdsm, play, besides, safe, sex, bdsm, sessions, often, require, a, wider, array, of, safety, precautions, than, vanilla, sex, sexual, behaviour, without, bdsm, elements, to, ensure, consent, related, to, bdsm, activity, pre, play, negotiations, are, commonplace, especially, among, partners, who, do, not, know, each, other, very, well, in, practice, pick, up, scenes, at, clubs, or, parties, may, sometimes, be, low, in, negotiation, much, as, pick, up, sex, from, singles, bars, may, not, involve, much, negotiation, or, disclosure, these, negotiations, concern, the, interests, and, fantasies, of, each, partner, and, establish, a, framework, of, both, acceptable, and, unacceptable, activities, this, kind, of, discussion, is, a, typical, unique, selling, proposition, of, bdsm, sessions, and, quite, commonplace, additionally, safewords, are, often, arranged, to, provide, for, an, immediate, stop, of, any, activity, if, any, participant, should, so, desire, safewords, are, words, or, phrases, that, are, called, out, when, things, are, either, not, going, as, planned, or, have, crossed, a, threshold, one, cannot, handle, they, are, something, both, parties, can, remember, and, recognize, and, are, by, definition, not, words, commonly, used, playfully, during, any, kind, of, scene, words, such, as, no, stop, and, don, t, are, often, inappropriate, as, a, safeword, if, the, roleplaying, aspect, includes, the, illusion, of, non, consent, the, traffic, light, system, tls, is, the, most, commonly, used, set, of, safewords, at, most, clubs, and, group, organized, bdsm, parties, and, events, dungeon, monitors, dms, provide, an, additional, safety, net, for, the, people, playing, there, ensuring, that, house, rules, are, followed, and, safewords, respected, bdsm, participants, are, expected, to, understand, practical, safety, aspects, such, as, the, potential, for, harm, to, body, parts, contusion, or, scarring, of, the, skin, can, be, a, concern, using, crops, whips, or, floggers, the, top, s, fine, motor, skills, and, anatomical, knowledge, can, make, the, difference, between, a, satisfying, session, for, the, bottom, and, a, highly, unpleasant, experience, that, may, even, entail, severe, physical, harm, the, very, broad, range, of, bdsm, toys, and, physical, and, psychological, control, techniques, often, requires, a, far, reaching, knowledge, of, details, related, to, the, requirements, of, the, individual, session, such, as, anatomy, physics, and, psychology, despite, these, risks, bdsm, activities, usually, result, in, far, less, severe, injuries, than, sports, like, boxing, and, football, and, bdsm, practitioners, do, not, visit, emergency, rooms, any, more, often, than, the, general, population, it, is, necessary, to, be, able, to, identify, each, person, s, psychological, squicks, or, triggers, in, advance, to, avoid, them, such, losses, of, emotional, balance, due, to, sensory, or, emotional, overload, are, a, fairly, commonly, discussed, issue, it, is, important, to, follow, participants, reactions, empathetically, and, continue, or, stop, accordingly, for, some, players, sparking, freakouts, or, deliberately, using, triggers, may, be, the, desired, outcome, safewords, are, one, way, for, bdsm, practices, to, protect, both, parties, however, partners, should, be, aware, of, each, other, s, psychological, states, and, behaviours, to, prevent, instances, where, the, freakouts, prevent, the, use, of, safewords, after, any, bdsm, activities, it, is, important, that, the, participants, go, through, sexual, aftercare, to, process, and, calm, down, from, the, activity, after, the, sessions, participants, can, need, aftercare, because, their, bodies, have, experienced, trauma, and, they, need, to, mentally, come, out, of, the, role, play, a, 2003, study, the, first, to, look, at, these, relationships, fully, demonstrated, that, quality, long, term, functioning, relationships, exist, among, practitioners, of, bdsm, with, either, sex, being, the, top, or, bottom, the, study, was, based, on, 17, heterosexual, couples, respondents, in, the, study, expressed, their, bdsm, orientation, to, be, built, into, who, they, are, but, considered, exploring, their, bdsm, interests, an, ongoing, task, and, showed, flexibility, and, adaptability, in, order, to, match, their, interests, with, their, partners, the, perfect, match, where, both, in, the, relationship, shared, the, same, tastes, and, desires, was, rare, and, most, relationships, required, both, partners, to, take, up, or, put, away, some, of, their, desires, the, bdsm, activities, that, the, couples, partook, in, varied, in, sexual, to, nonsexual, significance, for, the, partners, who, reported, doing, certain, bdsm, activities, for, couple, bonding, stress, release, and, spiritual, quests, the, most, reported, issue, amongst, respondents, was, not, finding, enough, time, to, be, in, role, with, most, adopting, a, lifestyle, wherein, both, partners, maintain, their, dominant, or, submissive, role, throughout, the, day, amongst, the, respondents, it, was, typically, the, bottoms, who, wanted, to, play, harder, and, be, more, restricted, into, their, roles, when, there, was, a, difference, in, desire, to, play, in, the, relationship, the, author, of, the, study, bert, cutler, speculated, that, tops, may, be, less, often, in, the, mood, to, play, due, to, the, increased, demand, for, responsibility, on, their, part, being, aware, of, the, safety, of, the, situation, and, prepared, to, remove, the, bottom, from, a, dangerous, scenario, being, conscious, of, the, desires, and, limits, of, the, bottom, and, so, on, the, author, of, the, study, stressed, that, successful, long, term, bdsm, relationships, came, after, early, and, thorough, disclosure, from, both, parties, of, their, bdsm, interests, many, of, those, engaged, in, long, term, bdsm, relationships, learned, their, skills, from, larger, bdsm, organizations, and, communities, there, was, a, lot, of, discussion, by, the, respondents, on, the, amount, of, control, the, top, possessed, in, the, relationships, but, no, discussion, of, being, better, or, smarter, or, of, more, value, than, the, bottom, couples, were, generally, of, the, same, mind, of, whether, or, not, they, were, in, an, ongoing, relationship, but, in, such, cases, the, bottom, was, not, locked, up, constantly, but, that, their, role, in, the, context, of, the, relationship, was, always, present, even, when, the, top, was, doing, non, dominant, activities, such, as, household, chores, or, the, bottom, being, in, a, more, dominant, position, in, its, conclusion, the, study, states, the, respondents, valued, themselves, their, partners, and, their, relationships, all, couples, expressed, considerable, goodwill, toward, their, partners, the, power, exchange, between, the, cohorts, appears, to, be, serving, purposes, beyond, any, sexual, satisfaction, including, experiencing, a, sense, of, being, taken, care, of, and, bonding, with, a, partner, the, study, further, goes, on, to, list, three, aspects, that, made, the, successful, relationships, work, early, disclosure, of, interests, and, continued, transparency, a, commitment, to, personal, growth, and, the, use, of, the, dominant, submissive, roles, as, a, tool, to, maintain, the, relationship, in, closing, remarks, the, author, of, the, study, theorizes, that, due, to, the, serious, potential, for, harm, couples, in, bdsm, relationships, develop, increased, communication, that, may, be, higher, than, in, mainstream, relationships, a, professional, dominatrix, or, professional, dominant, often, referred, to, within, the, culture, as, a, pro, dom, me, offers, services, encompassing, the, range, of, bondage, discipline, and, dominance, in, exchange, for, money, the, term, dominatrix, is, little, used, within, the, non, professional, bdsm, scene, a, non, professional, dominant, woman, is, more, commonly, referred, to, simply, as, a, domme, dominant, or, femdom, short, for, female, dominance, professional, submissives, pro, subs, although, far, more, rare, do, exist, in, bdsm, a, scene, is, the, stage, or, setting, where, bdsm, activity, takes, place, as, well, as, the, activity, itself, the, physical, place, where, a, bdsm, activity, takes, place, is, usually, called, a, dungeon, though, some, prefer, less, dramatic, terms, including, playspace, or, club, a, bdsm, activity, can, but, need, not, involve, sexual, activity, or, sexual, roleplay, a, characteristic, of, many, bdsm, relationships, is, the, power, exchange, from, the, bottom, to, the, dominant, partner, and, bondage, features, prominently, in, bdsm, scenes, and, sexual, roleplay, the, scene, including, use, of, the, definite, article, the, is, also, used, in, the, bdsm, community, to, refer, to, the, bdsm, community, as, a, whole, thus, someone, who, is, on, the, scene, and, prepared, to, play, in, public, might, take, part, in, a, scene, at, a, public, play, party, a, scene, can, take, place, in, private, between, two, or, more, people, and, can, involve, a, domestic, arrangement, such, as, servitude, or, a, casual, or, committed, lifestyle, master, slave, relationship, bdsm, elements, may, involve, settings, of, slave, training, or, punishment, for, breaches, of, instructions, a, scene, can, also, take, place, in, a, club, where, the, play, can, be, viewed, by, others, when, a, scene, takes, place, in, a, public, setting, it, may, be, because, the, participants, enjoy, being, watched, by, others, or, because, of, the, equipment, available, or, because, having, third, parties, present, adds, safety, for, play, partners, who, have, only, recently, met, most, standard, social, etiquette, rules, still, apply, when, at, a, bdsm, event, such, as, not, intimately, touching, someone, you, do, not, know, not, touching, someone, else, s, belongings, including, toys, and, abiding, by, dress, codes, many, events, open, to, the, public, also, have, rules, addressing, alcohol, consumption, recreational, drugs, cell, phones, and, photography, a, specific, scene, takes, place, within, the, general, conventions, and, etiquette, of, bdsm, such, as, requirements, for, mutual, consent, and, agreement, as, to, the, limits, of, any, bdsm, activity, this, agreement, can, be, incorporated, into, a, formal, contract, in, addition, most, clubs, have, additional, rules, which, regulate, how, onlookers, may, interact, with, the, actual, participants, in, a, scene, as, is, common, in, bdsm, these, are, founded, on, the, catchphrase, safe, sane, and, consensual, bdsm, play, parties, are, events, in, which, bdsm, practitioners, and, other, similarly, interested, people, meet, in, order, to, communicate, share, experiences, and, knowledge, and, to, play, in, an, erotic, atmosphere, bdsm, parties, show, similarities, to, ones, in, the, dark, culture, being, based, on, a, more, or, less, strictly, enforced, dress, code, often, clothing, made, of, latex, leather, or, vinyl, pvc, lycra, and, so, on, emphasizing, the, body, s, shape, and, the, primary, and, secondary, sexual, characteristics, the, requirement, for, such, dress, codes, differ, while, some, events, have, none, others, have, a, policy, in, order, to, create, a, more, coherent, atmosphere, and, to, prevent, outsiders, from, taking, part, at, these, parties, bdsm, can, be, publicly, performed, on, a, stage, or, more, privately, in, separate, dungeons, a, reason, for, the, relatively, fast, spread, of, this, kind, of, event, is, the, opportunity, to, use, a, wide, range, of, playing, equipment, which, in, most, apartments, or, houses, is, unavailable, slings, st, andrew, s, crosses, or, similar, restraining, constructs, spanking, benches, and, punishing, supports, or, cages, are, often, made, available, the, problem, of, noise, disturbance, is, also, lessened, at, these, events, while, in, the, home, setting, many, bdsm, activities, can, be, limited, by, this, factor, in, addition, such, parties, offer, both, exhibitionists, and, voyeurs, a, forum, to, indulge, their, inclinations, without, social, criticism, sexual, intercourse, is, not, permitted, within, most, public, bdsm, play, spaces, or, not, often, seen, in, others, because, it, is, not, the, emphasis, of, this, kind, of, play, in, order, to, ensure, the, maximum, safety, and, comfort, for, the, participants, certain, standards, of, behaviour, have, evolved, these, include, aspects, of, courtesy, privacy, respect, and, safewords, today, bdsm, parties, are, taking, place, in, most, of, the, larger, cities, in, the, western, world, this, scene, appears, particularly, on, the, internet, in, publications, and, in, meetings, such, as, at, fetish, clubs, like, torture, garden, sm, parties, gatherings, called, munches, and, erotic, fairs, like, venus, berlin, the, annual, folsom, street, fair, held, in, san, francisco, is, the, world, s, largest, bdsm, event, it, has, its, roots, in, the, gay, leather, movement, the, weekend, long, festivities, include, a, wide, range, of, sadomasochistic, erotica, in, a, public, clothing, optional, space, between, 8th, and, 13th, streets, with, nightly, parties, associated, with, the, organization, there, are, also, conventions, such, as, living, in, leather, and, black, rose, research, indicates, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, a, preference, for, bdsm, is, a, consequence, of, childhood, abuse, some, reports, suggest, that, people, abused, as, children, may, have, more, bdsm, injuries, and, have, difficulty, with, safe, words, being, recognized, as, meaning, stop, the, previously, consensual, behaviour, thus, it, is, possible, that, people, choosing, bdsm, as, part, of, their, lifestyle, who, also, were, previously, abused, may, have, had, more, police, or, hospital, reports, of, injuries, in, one, study, of, three, online, surveys, many, transgender, adults, remarked, that, bdsm, influenced, their, individual, experience, of, gender, joseph, merlino, author, and, psychiatry, adviser, to, the, new, york, daily, news, said, in, an, interview, that, a, sadomasochistic, relationship, as, long, as, it, is, consensual, is, not, a, psychological, problem, it, s, a, problem, only, if, it, is, getting, that, individual, into, difficulties, if, he, or, she, is, not, happy, with, it, or, it, s, causing, problems, in, their, personal, or, professional, lives, if, it, s, not, i, m, not, seeing, that, as, a, problem, but, assuming, that, it, did, what, i, would, wonder, about, is, what, is, his, or, her, biology, that, would, cause, a, tendency, toward, a, problem, and, dynamically, what, were, the, experiences, this, individual, had, that, led, him, or, her, toward, one, of, the, ends, of, the, spectrum, some, psychologists, agree, that, experiences, during, early, sexual, development, can, have, a, profound, effect, on, the, character, of, sexuality, later, in, life, sadomasochistic, desires, however, seem, to, form, at, a, variety, of, ages, some, individuals, report, having, had, them, before, puberty, while, others, do, not, discover, them, until, well, into, adulthood, according, to, one, study, the, majority, of, male, sadomasochists, 53, developed, their, interest, before, the, age, of, 15, while, the, majority, of, females, 78, developed, their, interest, afterward, breslow, evans, and, langley, 1985, the, prevalence, of, sadomasochism, within, the, general, population, is, unknown, despite, female, sadists, being, less, visible, than, males, some, surveys, have, resulted, in, comparable, amounts, of, sadistic, fantasies, between, females, and, males, the, results, of, such, studies, demonstrate, that, one, s, sex, does, not, determine, preference, for, sadism, following, a, phenomenological, study, of, nine, individuals, involved, in, sexual, masochistic, sessions, who, regarded, pain, as, central, to, their, experience, sexual, masochism, was, described, as, an, addiction, like, tendency, with, several, features, resembling, that, of, drug, addiction, craving, intoxication, tolerance, and, withdrawal, it, was, also, demonstrated, how, the, first, masochistic, experience, is, placed, on, a, pedestal, with, subsequent, use, aiming, at, retrieving, this, lost, sensation, much, as, described, in, the, descriptive, literature, on, addiction, bdsm, occurs, among, people, of, all, genders, and, sexual, orientations, and, in, varied, occurrences, and, intensities, the, spectrum, ranges, from, couples, with, no, connections, to, the, subculture, outside, of, their, bedrooms, or, homes, without, any, awareness, of, the, concept, of, bdsm, playing, tie, me, up, games, to,

varies, alfred, kinsey, stated, in, his, 1953, nonfiction, book, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, that, 12, of, females, and, 22, of, males, reported, having, an, erotic, response, to, a, sadomasochistic, story, in, that, book, erotic, responses, to, being, bitten, were, given, as, a, non, representative, survey, on, the, sexual, behaviour, of, american, students, published, in, 1997,

surveys, indicate, similar, dimensions, in, differing, target, groups, a, representative, study, done, from, 2001, to, 2002, in, australia, found, that, 1, 8, of, sexually, active, people, 2, 2, men,

media, coverage, since, the, middle, 1990s, thus, both, black, leather, clothing, sexual, jewelry, such, as, chains, and, dominance, roleplay, appear, increasingly, outside, of, bdsm, contexts, according, to, yet, another, survey, of, 317, 000, people, in, 41, countries, about, 20, of, the, surveyed, have, at, least, used, masks, blindfolds, or, other, bondage, utilities, once, and, 5,

to, come, into, effect, in, 2022, some, people, who, are, interested, in, or, curious, about, bdsm, decide, to, come, out, of, the, closet, although, many, sadomasochists, remain, closeted, depending, upon, a, survey, s, participants, about, 5, to, 25, per, cent, of, the, us, population, show, affinity, to, the, subject, other, than, a, few, artists, and, writers, practically, no, celebrities, are, publicly, known, as, sadomasochists, public, knowledge, of, one, s, bdsm, lifestyle, can, have, detrimental, vocational, and, social, effects, for, sadomasochists, many, face, severe, professional, consequences, or, social, rejection, if, they, are, exposed, either, voluntarily, or, involuntarily, as, sadomasochists, within, feminist, circles, the, discussion, is, split, roughly, into, two, camps, some, who, see, bdsm, as, an, aspect, or, reflection, of, oppression, for, example, alice, schwarzer, and, on, the, other, side, pro, bdsm, feminists, often, grouped, under, the, banner, of, sex, positive, feminism, see, samois, both, of, them, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 1970s, some, feminists, have, criticized, bdsm, for, eroticizing, power, and, violence, and, reinforcing, misogyny, they, argue, that, women, who, engage, in, bdsm, are, making, a, choice, that, is, ultimately, bad, for, women, feminist, defenders, of, bdsm, argue, that, consensual, bdsm, activities, are, enjoyed, by, many, women, and, validate, the, sexual, inclinations, of, these, women, they, argue, that, there, is, no, connection, between, consensual, kinky, activities, and, sex, crimes, and, that, feminists, should, not, attack, other, women, s, sexual, desires, as, being, anti, feminist, they, also, state, that, the, main, point, of, feminism, is, to, give, an, individual, woman, free, choices, in, her, life, which, includes, her, sexual, desire, while, some, feminists, suggest, connections, between, consensual, bdsm, scenes, and, non, consensual, rape, and, sexual, assault, other, sex, positive, ones, find, the, notion, insulting, to, women, roles, are, not, fixed, to, gender, but, personal, preferences, the, dominant, partner, in, a, heterosexual, relationship, may, be, the, woman, rather, than, the, man, or, bdsm, may, be, part, of, male, male, or, female, female, sexual, relationships, finally, some, people, switch, taking, either, a, dominant, or, submissive, role, on, different, occasions, several, studies, investigating, the, possibility, of, a, correlation, between, bdsm, pornography, and, the, violence, against, women, also, indicate, a, lack, of, correlation, in, 1991, a, lateral, survey, came, to, the, conclusion, that, between, 1964, and, 1984, despite, the, increase, in, amount, and, availability, of, sadomasochistic, pornography, in, the, u, s, germany, denmark, and, sweden, there, is, no, correlation, with, the, national, number, of, rapes, to, be, found, operation, spanner, in, the, u, k, proves, that, bdsm, practitioners, still, run, the, risk, of, being, stigmatized, as, criminals, in, 2003, the, media, coverage, of, jack, mcgeorge, showed, that, simply, participating, and, working, in, bdsm, support, groups, poses, risks, to, one, s, job, even, in, countries, where, no, law, restricts, it, here, a, clear, difference, can, be, seen, to, the, situation, of, homosexuality, the, psychological, strain, appearing, in, some, individual, cases, is, normally, neither, articulated, nor, acknowledged, in, public, nevertheless, it, leads, to, a, difficult, psychological, situation, in, which, the, person, concerned, can, be, exposed, to, high, levels, of, emotional, stress, in, the, stages, of, self, awareness, he, or, she, realizes, their, desires, related, to, bdsm, scenarios, or, decides, to, be, open, for, such, some, authors, call, this, internal, coming, out, two, separate, surveys, on, this, topic, independently, came, to, the, conclusion, that, 58, per, cent, and, 67, per, cent, of, the, sample, respectively, had, realized, their, disposition, before, their, 19th, birthday, other, surveys, on, this, topic, show, comparable, results, independent, of, age, coming, out, can, potentially, result, in, a, difficult, life, crisis, sometimes, leading, to, thoughts, or, acts, of, suicide, while, homosexuals, have, created, support, networks, in, the, last, decades, sadomasochistic, support, networks, are, just, starting, to, develop, in, most, countries, in, german, speaking, countries, they, are, only, moderately, more, developed, the, internet, is, the, prime, contact, point, for, support, groups, today,

found, that, people, who, engaged, in, bdsm, were, more, likely, to, have, experienced, a, wider, range, of, sexual, practices, e, g, oral, or, anal, sex, more, than, one, partner, group, sex, phone, sex, viewed, pornography, used, a, sex, toy, fisting, etc, they, were, however, not, any, more, likely, to, have, been, coerced, unhappy, anxious, or, experiencing, sexual, difficulties, on, the, contrary, men, who, had, engaged, in, bdsm, scored, lower, on, a, psychological, distress, scale, than, men, who, did, not, there, have, been, few, studies, on, the, psychological, aspects, of, bdsm, using, modern, scientific, standards, psychotherapist, charles, moser, has, said, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, theory, that, bdsm, has, common, symptoms, or, any, common, psychopathology, emphasizing, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, bdsm, practitioners, have, any, special, psychiatric, other, problems, based, on, their, sexual, preferences, problems, sometimes, occur, with, self, classification, during, the, phase, of, the, coming, out, self, questioning, related, to, one, s, own, normality, is, common, according, to, moser, the, discovery, of, bdsm, preferences, can, result, in, fear, of, the, current, non, bdsm, relationship, s, destruction, this, combined, with, the, fear, of, discrimination, in, everyday, life, leads, in, some, cases, to, a, double, life, which, can, be, highly, burdensome, at, the, same, time, the, denial, of, bdsm, preferences, can, induce, stress, and, dissatisfaction, with, one, s, own, vanilla, lifestyle, feeding, the, apprehension, of, finding, no, partner, moser, states, that, bdsm, practitioners, having, problems, finding, bdsm, partners, would, probably, have, problems, in, finding, a, non, bdsm, partner, as, well, the, wish, to, remove, bdsm, preferences, is, another, possible, reason, for, psychological, problems, since, it, is, not, possible, in, most, cases, finally, the, scientist, states, that, bdsm, practitioners, seldom, commit, violent, crimes, from, his, point, of, view, crimes, of, bdsm, practitioners, usually, have, no, connection, with, the, bdsm, components, existing, in, their, life, moser, s, study, comes, to, the, conclusion, that, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, which, could, give, reason, to, refuse, members, of, this, group, work, or, safety, certificates, adoption, possibilities, custody, or, other, social, rights, or, privileges, the, swiss, psychoanalyst, fritz, morgenthaler, shares, a, similar, perspective, in, his, book, homosexuality, heterosexuality, perversion, 1988, he, states, that, possible, problems, result, not, necessarily, from, the, non, normative, behavior, but, in, most, cases, primarily, from, the, real, or, feared, reactions, of, the, social, environment, towards, their, own, preferences, in, 1940, psychoanalyst, theodor, reik, reached, implicitly, the, same, conclusion, in, his, standard, work, aus, leiden, freuden, masochismus, und, gesellschaft, moser, s, results, are, further, supported, by, a, 2008, australian, study, by, richters, et, al, on, the, demographic, and, psychosocial, features, of, bdsm, participants, the, study, found, that, bdsm, practitioners, were, no, more, likely, to, have, experienced, sexual, assault, than, the, control, group, and, were, not, more, likely, to, feel, unhappy, or, anxious, the, bdsm, males, reported, higher, levels, of, psychological, well, being, than, the, controls, it, was, concluded, that, bdsm, is, simply, a, sexual, interest, or, subculture, attractive, to, a, minority, not, a, pathological, symptom, of, past, abuse, or, difficulty, with, normal, sex, several, recent, studies, have, been, conducted, on, the, gender, differences, and, personality, traits, of, bdsm, practitioners, wismeijer, and, van, assen, 2013, found, that, the, association, of, bdsm, role, and, gender, was, strong, and, significant, with, only, 8, of, women, in, the, study, being, dominant, compared, to, 75, being, submissive, h, bert, and, weaver, 2014, found, that, 9, of, women, in, their, study, were, dominant, compared, to, 88, submissive, weierstall1, and, giebel, 2017, likewise, found, a, significant, difference, with, 19, of, women, in, the, study, as, dominant, compared, to, 74, as, submissive, and, a, study, from, andrea, duarte, silva, 2015, indicated, that, 61, 7, of, females, who, are, active, in, bdsm, expressed, a, preference, for, a, submissive, role, 25, 7, consider, themselves, a, switch, while, 12, 6, prefer, the, dominant, role, in, contrast, 46, 6, of, men, prefer, the, submissive, role, 24, consider, themselves, to, be, switches, and, 29, 5, prefer, the, dominant, role, they, concluded, that, men, more, often, display, an, engagement, in, dominant, practices, whereas, females, take, on, the, submissive, part, this, result, is, inline, with, a, recent, study, about, mate, preferences, that, has, shown, that, women, have, a, generally, higher, preference, for, a, dominant, partner, than, men, do, giebel, moran, schawohl, weierstall, 2015, women, also, prefer, dominant, men, and, even, men, who, are, aggressive, for, a, short, term, relationship, and, for, the, purpose, of, sexual, intercourse, giebel, weierstall, schauer, elbert, 2013, similarly, studies, on, sexual, fantasy, differences, between, men, and, women, show, the, latter, prefer, submissive, and, passive, fantasies, over, dominant, and, active, ones, with, rape, and, force, being, common, one, common, belief, of, bdsm, and, kink, is, that, women, are, more, likely, to, take, on, masochistic, roles, than, men, roy, baumeister, 2010, actually, had, more, male, masochists, in, his, study, than, female, and, fewer, male, dominants, than, female, the, lack, of, statistical, significance, in, these, gender, differences, suggests, that, no, assumptions, should, be, made, regarding, gender, and, masochistic, roles, in, bdsm, one, explanation, why, we, might, think, otherwise, lies, in, our, social, and, cultural, ideals, about, femininity, masochism, may, emphasize, certain, stereotypically, feminine, elements, through, activities, like, feminization, of, men, and, ultra, feminine, clothing, for, women, but, such, tendencies, of, the, submissive, masochistic, role, should, not, be, interpreted, as, a, connection, between, it, and, the, stereotypical, female, role, many, masochistic, scripts, do, not, include, any, of, these, tendencies, baumeister, found, that, masochistic, males, experienced, greater, severity, of, pain, frequency, of, humiliation, status, loss, degrading, oral, partner, infidelity, active, participation, by, other, persons, and, cross, dressing, trends, also, suggested, that, male, masochism, included, more, bondage, and, oral, sex, than, female, though, the, data, was, not, significant, female, masochists, on, the, other, hand, experienced, greater, frequency, in, pain, pain, as, punishment, for, misdeeds, in, the, relationship, context, display, humiliation, genital, intercourse, and, presence, of, non, participating, audiences, the, exclusiveness, of, dominant, males, in, a, heterosexual, relationship, happens, because, historically, men, in, power, preferred, multiple, partners, finally, baumeister, observes, a, contrast, between, the, intense, sensation, focus, of, male, masochism, to, a, more, meaning, and, emotion, centred, female, masochistic, script, prior, argues, that, although, some, of, these, women, may, appear, to, be, engaging, in, traditional, subordinate, or, submissive, roles, bdsm, allows, women, in, both, dominant, and, submissive, roles, to, express, and, experience, personal, power, through, their, sexual, identities, in, a, study, that, she, conducted, in, 2013, she, found, that, the, majority, of, the, women, she, interviewed, identified, as, bottom, submissive, captive, or, slave, sex, slave, in, turn, prior, was, able, to, answer, whether, or, not, these, women, found, an, incongruity, between, their, sexual, identities, and, feminist, identity, her, research, found, that, these, women, saw, little, to, no, incongruity, and, in, fact, felt, that, their, feminist, identity, supported, identities, of, submissive, and, slave, for, them, these, are, sexually, and, emotionally, fulfilling, roles, and, identities, that, in, some, cases, feed, other, aspects, of, their, lives, prior, contends, that, third, wave, feminism, provides, a, space, for, women, in, bdsm, communities, to, express, their, sexual, identities, fully, even, when, those, identities, seem, counter, intuitive, to, the, ideals, of, feminism, furthermore, women, who, do, identify, as, submissive, sexually, or, otherwise, find, a, space, within, bdsm, where, they, can, fully, express, themselves, as, integrated, well, balanced, and, powerful, women, levitt, moser, and, jamison, s, 1994, study, provides, a, general, if, outdated, description, of, characteristics, of, women, in, the, sadomasochistic, s, m, subculture, they, state, that, women, in, s, m, tend, to, have, higher, education, become, more, aware, of, their, desires, as, young, adults, are, less, likely, to, be, married, than, the, general, population, the, researchers, found, the, majority, of, females, identified, as, heterosexual, and, submissive, a, substantial, minority, were, versatile, able, to, switch, between, dominant, and, submissive, roles, and, a, smaller, minority, identified, with, the, dominant, role, exclusively, oral, sex, bondage, and, master,

orientation, the, bdsm, and, kink, scene, is, more, often, seen, as, a, diverse, pansexual, community, often, this, is, a, non, judgmental, community, where, gender, sexuality, orientation, preferences, are, accepted, as, is, or, worked, at, to, become, something, a, person, can, be, happy, with, in, research, studies, have, focused, on, bisexuality, and, its, parallels, with, bdsm, as, well, as, gay, straight, differences, between, practitioners, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, asexual, people, have, found, a, language, for, navigating, relationships, through, bdsm, in, steve, lenius, original, 2001, paper, he, explored, the, acceptance, of, bisexuality, in, a, supposedly, pansexual, bdsm, community, the, reasoning, behind, this, is, that, coming, out, had, become, primarily, the, territory, of, the, gay, and, lesbian, with, bisexuals, feeling, the, push, to, be, one, or, the, other, and, being, right, only, half, the, time, either, way, what, he, found, in, 2001, was, that, people, in, bdsm, were, open, to, discussion, about, the, topic, of, bisexuality, and, pansexuality, and, all, controversies, they, bring, to, the, table, but, personal, biases, and, issues, stood, in, the, way, of, actively, using, such, labels, a, decade, later, lenius, 2011, looks, back, on, his, study, and, considers, if, anything, has, changed, he, concluded, that, the, standing, of, bisexuals, in, the, bdsm, and, kink, community, was, unchanged, and, believed, that, positive, shifts, in, attitude, were, moderated, by, society, s, changing, views, towards, different, sexualities, and, orientations, but, lenius, 2011, does, emphasize, that, the, pansexual, promoting, bdsm, community, helped, advance, greater, acceptance, of, alternative, sexualities, brandy, lin, simula, 2012, on, the, other, hand, argues, that, bdsm, actively, resists, gender, conforming, and, identified, three, different, types, of, bdsm, bisexuality, gender, switching, gender, based, styles, taking, on, a, different, gendered, style, depending, on, the, gender, of, partner, when, playing, and, rejection, of, gender, resisting, the, idea, that, gender, matters, in, their, play, partners, simula, 2012, explains, that, practitioners, of, bdsm, routinely, challenge, our, concepts, of, sexuality, by, pushing, the, limits, on, pre, existing, ideas, of, sexual, orientation, and, gender, norms, for, some, bdsm, and, kink, provides, a, platform, in, creating, identities, that, are, fluid, ever, changing, demographically, nordling, et, al, s, 2006, study, found, no, differences, in, age, but, 43, of, gay, male, respondents, compared, to, 29, of, straight, males, had, university, level, education, the, gay, men, also, had, higher, incomes, than, the, general, population, and, tended, to, work, in, white, collar, jobs, while, straight, men, tended, toward, blue, collar, ones, because, there, were, not, enough, female, respondents, 22, no, conclusions, could, be, drawn, from, them, sexually, speaking, the, same, 2006, study, by, nordling, et, al, found, that, gay, males, were, aware, of, their, s, m, preferences, and, took, part, in, them, at, an, earlier, age, preferring, leather, anal, sex, rimming, dildos, and, special, equipment, or, uniform, scenes, in, contrast, straight, men, preferred, verbal, humiliation, mask, and, blindfolds, gags, rubber, latex, outfits, caning, vaginal, sex, straitjackets, and, cross, dressing, among, other, activities, from, the, questionnaire, researchers, were, able, to, identify, four, separate, sexual, themes, hyper, masculinity, giving, and, receiving, pain, physical, restriction, i, e, bondage, and, psychological, humiliation, gay, men, preferred, activities, that, tended, towards, hyper, masculinity, while, straight, men, showed, greater, preference, for, humiliation, significantly, higher, master, madame, slave, role, play, at, 84, though, there, were, not, enough, female, respondents, to, draw, a, similar, conclusion, with, the, fact, that, there, is, a, difference, in, gay, and, straight, men, suggests, strongly, that, s, m, and, bdsm, in, general, can, not, be, considered, a, homogenous, phenomenon, as, nordling, et, al, 2006, puts, it, people, who, identify, as, sadomasochists, mean, different, things, by, these, identifications, 54, psychiatry, has, an, insensitive, history, in, the, area, of, bdsm, there, have, been, many, involvements, by, institutions, of, political, power, to, marginalize, subgroups, and, sexual, minorities, mental, health, professionals, have, a, long, history, of, holding, negative, assumptions, and, stereotypes, about, the, bdsm, community, beginning, with, the, dsm, ii, sexual, sadism, and, sexual, masochism, have, been, listed, as, sexually, deviant, behaviours, sadism, and, masochism, were, also, found, in, the, personality, disorder, section, this, negative, assumption, has, not, changed, significantly, which, is, evident, in, the, continued, inclusion, of, sexual, sadism, and, sexual, masochism, as, paraphilias, in, the, dsm, iv, tr, the, dsm, v, however, has, depathologized, the, language, around, paraphilias, in, a, way, that, signifies, the, apa, s, intent, to, not, demand, treatment, for, healthy, consenting, adult, sexual, expression, these, biases, and, misinformation, can, result, in, pathologizing, and, unintentional, harm, to, clients, who, identify, as, sadists, and, or, masochists, and, medical, professionals, who, have, been, trained, under, older, editions, of, the, dsm, can, be, slow, to, change, in, their, ways, of, clinical, practice, according, to, kolmes, et, al, 2006, major, themes, of, biased, and, inadequate, care, to, bdsm, clients, are, these, same, researchers, suggested, that, therapists, should, be, open, to, learning, more, about, bdsm, to, show, comfort, in, talking, about, bdsm, issues, and, to, understand, and, promote, safe, sane, consensual, bdsm, there, has, also, been, research, which, suggests, bdsm, can, be, a, beneficial, way, for, victims, of, sexual, assault, to, deal, with, their, trauma, most, notably, by, corie, hammers, but, this, work, is, limited, in, scope, and, to, date, has, not, undergone, empirical, testing, as, a, treatment, nichols, 2006, compiled, some, common, clinical, issues, countertransference, non, disclosure, coming, out, partner, families, and, bleed, through, countertransference, is, a, common, problem, in, clinical, settings, despite, having, no, evidence, therapists, may, find, themselves, believing, that, their, client, s, pathology, is, self, evident, therapists, may, feel, intense, disgust, and, aversive, reactions, feelings, of, countertransference, can, interfere, with, therapy, another, common, problem, is, when, clients, conceal, their, sexual, preferences, from, their, therapists, this, can, compromise, any, therapy, to, avoid, non, disclosure, therapists, are, encouraged, to, communicate, their, openness, in, indirect, ways, with, literature, and, artworks, in, the, waiting, room, therapists, can, also, deliberately, bring, up, bdsm, topics, during, the, course, of, therapy, with, less, informed, therapists, sometimes, they, over, focus, on, clients, sexuality, which, detracts, from, original, issues, such, as, family, relationships, depression, etc, a, special, subgroup, that, needs, counselling, is, the, newbie, individuals, just, coming, out, might, have, internalized, shame, fear, and, self, hatred, about, their, sexual, preferences, therapists, need, to, provide, acceptance, care, and, model, positive, attitude, providing, reassurance, psychoeducation, and, bibliotherapy, for, these, clients, is, crucial, the, average, age, when, bdsm, individuals, realize, their, sexual, preference, is, around, 26, years, many, people, hide, their, sexuality, until, they, can, no, longer, contain, their, desires, however, they, may, have, married, or, had, children, by,

to, men, wearing, leather, leather, and, bdsm, are, seen, as, two, parts, of, one, whole, much, of, the, bdsm, culture, can, be, traced, back, to, the, gay, male, leather, culture, which, formalized, itself, out, of, the, group, of, men, who, were, soldiers, returning, home, after, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, world, war, ii, was, the, setting, where, countless, homosexual, men, and, women, tasted,

leather, community, many, of, the, members, were, attracted, to, extreme, forms, of, sexuality, for, which, peak, expression, was, in, the, pre, aids, 1970s, this, subculture, is, epitomized, by, the, leatherman, s, handbook, by, larry, townsend, published, in, 1972, which, describes, in, detail, the, practices, and, culture, of, gay, male, sadomasochists, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, in, the, early, 1980s, lesbians, also, joined, the, leathermen, as, a, recognizable, element, of, the, gay, leather, community, they, also, formed, leather, clubs, but, there, were, some, gender, differences, such, as, the, absence, of, leatherwomen, s, bars, in, 1981, the, publication, of, coming, to, power, by, lesbian, feminist, group, samois, led, to, a, greater, knowledge, and, acceptance, of, bdsm, in, the, lesbian, community, by, the, 1990s, the, gay, men, s, and, women, s, leather, communities, were, no, longer, underground, and, played, an, important, role, in, the,

the, bdsm, subculture, was, gay, in, the, past, in, the, 1990s, the, so, called, new, guard, leather, subculture, evolved, this, new, orientation, started, to, integrate, psychological, aspects, into,

of, the, society, of, janus, the, second, oldest, bdsm, organization, in, the, united, states, who, were, an, important, part, of, the, leather, communities, of, san, francisco, in, the, late, 1980s, the, internet, provided, a, way, of, finding, people, with, specialized, interests, around, the, world, as, well, as, on, a, local, level, and, communicating, with, them, anonymously, this, brought, about, an, explosion, of, interest, and, knowledge, of, bdsm, particularly, on, the, usenet, group, alt, sex, bondage, when, that, group, became, too, cluttered, with, spam, the, focus, moved, to, soc, subculture, bondage, bdsm, with, an, increased, focus, on, forms, of, social, media, fetlife, was, formed, which, advertises, itself, as, a, social, network, for, the, bdsm, and, fetish, community, it, operates, similarly, to, other, social, media, sites, with, the, ability, to, make, friends, with, other, users, events, and, pages, of, shared, interests, in, addition, to, traditional, sex, shops, which, sell, sex, paraphernalia, there, has, also, been, an, explosive, growth, of, online, adult, toy, companies, that, specialize, in, leather, latex, gear, and, bdsm, toys, once, a, very, niche, market, there, are, now, very, few, sex, toy, companies, that, do, not, offer, some, sort, of, bdsm, or, fetish, gear, in, their, catalog, kinky, elements, seem, to, have, worked, their, way, into, vanilla, markets, the, former, niche, expanded, to, an, important, pillar, of, the, business, with, adult, accessories, today, practically, all, suppliers, of, sex, toys, do, offer, items, which, originally, found, usage, in, the, bdsm, subculture, padded, handcuffs, latex, and, leather, garments, as, well, as, more, exotic, items, like, soft, whips, for, fondling, and, tens, for, erotic, electro, stimulation, can, be, found, in, catalogs, aiming, at, classical, vanilla, target, groups, indicating, that, former, boundaries, increasingly, seem, to, shift, during, the, last, years, the, internet, also, provides, a, central, platform, for, networking, among, individuals, who, are, interested, in, the, subject, besides, countless, private, and, commercial, choices, there, is, an, increasing, number, of, local, networks, and, support, groups, emerging, these, groups, often, offer, comprehensive, background, and, health, related, information, for, people, who, have, been, unwillingly, outed, as, well, as, contact, lists, with, information, on, psychologists, physicians, and, lawyers, who, are, familiar, with, bdsm, related, topics, increasingly, american, universities, are, witnessing, bdsm, and, kink, education, by, providing, student, clubs, such, as, columbia, university, s, conversio, virium, and, iowa, state, university, s, cuffs, university,

not, be, subject, to, penalty, in, cases, in, which, the, victim, has, consented, and, the, injury, or, endangerment, does, not, offend, moral, sensibilities, case, law, from, the, austrian, supreme, court, has, consistently, shown, that, bodily, injury, is, only, offensive, to, moral, sensibilities, thus, it, is, only, punishable, when, a, serious, injury, damage, to, health, or, an, employment, disability, lasting, more, than, 24, days, or, the, death, of, the, victim, results, a, light, injury, is, generally, considered, permissible, when, the, victim, has, consented, to, it, in, cases, of, threats, to, bodily, well, being, the, standard, depends, on, the, probability, that, an, injury, will, actually, occur, if, serious, injury, or, even, death, would, be, a, likely, result, of, a, threat, being, carried, out, then, even, the, threat, itself, is, considered, punishable, in, 2004, a, judge, in, canada, ruled, that, videos, seized, by, the, police, featuring, bdsm, activities, were, not, obscene, and, did, not, constitute, violence, but, a, normal, and, acceptable, sexual, activity, between, two, consenting, adults, in, 2011, the, supreme, court, of, canada, ruled, in, r, v, j, a, that, a, person, must, have, an, active, mind, during, the, specific, sexual, activity, in, order, to, legally, consent, the, court, ruled, that, it, is, a, criminal, offence, to, perform, a, sexual, act, on, an, unconscious, person, whether, or, not, that, person, consented, in, advance, according, to, section, 194, of, the, german, criminal, code, the, charge, of, insult, slander, can, only, be, prosecuted, if, the, defamed, person, chooses, to, press, charges, false, imprisonment, can, be, charged, if, the, victim, when, applying, an, objective, view, can, be, considered, to, be, impaired, in, their, rights, of, free, movement, according, to, section, 228, a, person, inflicting, a, bodily, injury, on, another, person, with, that, person, s, permission, violates, the, law, only, in, cases, where, the, act, can, be, considered, to, have, violated, good, morals, in, spite, of, permission, having, been, given, on, 26, may, 2004, the, criminal, panel, no, 2, of, the, bundesgerichtshof, german, federal, court, ruled, that, sado, masochistically, motivated, physical, injuries, are, not, per, se, indecent, and, thus, subject, to, section, 228, following, cases, in, which, sado, masochistic, practices, had, been, repeatedly, used, as, pressure, tactics, against, former, partners, in, custody, cases, the, appeals, court, of, hamm, ruled, in, february, 2006, that, sexual, inclinations, toward, sado, masochism, are, no, indication, of, a, lack, of, capabilities, for, successful, child, raising, in, italian, law, bdsm, is, right, on, the, border, between, crime, and, legality, and, everything, lies, in, the, interpretation, of, the, legal, code, by, the, judge, this, concept, is, that, anyone, willingly, causing, injury, to, another, person, is, to, be, punished, in, this, context, though, injury, is, legally, defined, as, anything, causing, a, condition, of, illness, and, illness, is, ill, defined, itself, in, two, different, legal, ways, the, first, is, any, anatomical, or, functional, alteration, of, the, organism, thus, technically, including, little, scratches, and, bruises, too, the, second, is, a, significant, worsening, of, a, previous, condition, relevant, to, organic, and, relational, processes, requiring, any, kind, of, therapy, this, could, make, it, somewhat, risky, to, play, with, someone, as, later, the, victim, may, call, foul, play, citing, even, an, insignificant, mark, as, evidence, against, the, partner, also, any, injury, requiring, over, 20, days, of, medical, care, must, be, denounced, by, the, professional, medic, who, discovers, it, leading, to, automatic, indictment, of, the, person, who, caused, it, in, september, 2010, a, swedish, court, acquitted, a, 32, year, old, man, of, assault, for, engaging, in, consensual, bdsm, play, with, a, 16, year, old, girl, the, age, of, consent, in, sweden, is, 15, norway, s, legal, system, has, likewise, taken, a, similar, position, that, safe, and, consensual, bdsm, play, should, not, be, subject, to, criminal, prosecution, this, parallels, the, stance, of, the, mental, health, professions, in, the, nordic, countries, which, have, removed, sadomasochism, from, their, respective, lists, of, psychiatric, illnesses, the, age, of, consent, in, switzerland, is, 16, years, which, also, applies, to, bdsm, play, minors, i, e, those, under, 16, are, not, subject, to, punishment, for, bdsm, play, as, long, as, the, age, difference, between, them, is, less, than, three, years, certain, practices, however, require, granting, consent, for, light, injuries, with, only, those, over, 18, permitted, to, give, consent, on, 1, april, 2002, articles, 135, and, 197, of, the, swiss, criminal, code, were, tightened, to, make, ownership, of, objects, or, demonstrations, which, depict, sexual, acts, with, violent, content, a, punishable, offense, this, law, amounts, to, a, general, criminalization, of, sado, masochism, since, nearly, every, sado, masochist, will, have, some, kind, of, media, that, fulfills, this, criterion, critics, also, object, to, the, wording, of, the, law, which, puts, sado, masochists, in, the, same, category, as, pedophiles, and, pederasts, in, british, law, consent, is, an, absolute, defense, to, common, assault, but, not, necessarily, to, actual, bodily, harm, where, courts, may, decide, that, consent, is, not, valid, as, occurred, in, the, case, of, r, v, brown, accordingly, consensual, activities, in, the, u, k, may, not, constitute, assault, occasioning, actual, or, grievous, bodily, harm, in, law, the, spanner, trust, states, that, this, is, defined, as, activities, which, have, caused, injury, of, a, lasting, nature, but, that, only, a, slight, duration, or, injury, might, be, considered, lasting, in, law, the, decision, contrasts, with, the, later, case, of, r, v, wilson, in, which, conviction, for, non, sexual, consensual, branding, within, a, marriage, was, overturned, the, appeal, court, ruling, that, r, v, brown, was, not, an, authority, in, all, cases, of, consensual, injury, and, criticizing, the, decision, to, prosecute, following, operation, spanner, the, european, court, of, human, rights, ruled, in, january, 1999, in, laskey, jaggard, and, brown, v, united, kingdom, that, no, violation, of, article, 8, occurred, because, the, amount, of, physical, or, psychological, harm, that, the, law, allows, between, any, two, people, even, consenting, adults, is, to, be, determined, by, the, jurisdiction, the, individuals, live, in, as, it, is, the, state, s, responsibility, to, balance, the, concerns, of, public, health, and, well, being, with, the, amount, of, control, a, state, should, be, allowed, to, exercise, over, its, citizens, in, the, criminal, justice, and, immigration, bill, 2007, the, british, government, cited, the, spanner, case, as, justification, for, criminalizing, images, of, consensual, acts, as, part, of, its, proposed, criminalization, of, possession, of, extreme, pornography, another, contrasting, case, was, that, of, stephen, lock, in, 2013, who, was, cleared, of, actual, bodily, harm, on, the, grounds, that, the, woman, consented, in, this, case, the, act, was, deemed, to, be, sexual, the, united, states, federal, law, does, not, list, a, specific, criminal, determination, for, consensual, bdsm, acts, many, bdsm, practitioners, cite, the, legal, decision, of, people, v, jovanovic, 95, n, y, 2d, 846, 2000, or, the, cybersex, torture, case, which, was, the, first, u, s, appellate, decision, to, hold, in, effect, that, one, does, not, commit, assault, if, the, victim, consents, however, many, individual, states, do, criminalize, specific, bdsm, actions, within, their, state, borders, some, states, specifically, address, the, idea, of, consent, to, bdsm, acts, within, their, assault, laws, such, as, the, state, of, new, jersey, which, defines, simple, assault, to, be, a, disorderly, persons, offense, unless, committed, in, a, fight, or, scuffle, entered, into, by, mutual, consent, in, which, case, it, is, a, petty, disorderly, persons, offense, oregon, ballot, measure, 9, was, a, ballot, measure, in, the, u, s, state, of, oregon, in, 1992, concerning, sadism, masochism, gay, rights, pedophilia, and, public, education, that, drew, widespread, national, attention, it, would, have, added, the, following, text, to, the, oregon, constitution, all, governments, in, oregon, may, not, use, their, monies, or, properties, to, promote, encourage, or, facilitate, homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism, or, masochism, all, levels, of, government, including, public, education, systems, must, assist, in, setting, a, standard, for, oregon, s, youth, which, recognizes, that, these, behaviors, are, abnormal, wrong, unnatural, and, perverse, and, they, are, to, be, discouraged, and, avoided, it, was, defeated, in, the, 3, november, 1992, general, election, with, 638, 527, votes, in, favor, 828, 290, votes, against, the, national, coalition, for, sexual, freedom, collects, reports, about, punishment, for, sexual, activities, engaged, in, by, consenting, adults, and, about, its, use, in, child, custody, cases, today, the, bdsm, culture, exists, in, most, western, countries, this, offers, bdsm, practitioners, the, opportunity, to, discuss, bdsm, relevant, topics, and, problems, with, like, minded, people, this, culture, is, often, viewed, as, a, subculture, mainly, because, bdsm, is, often, still, regarded, as, unusual, by, some, of, the, public, many, people, hide, their, leaning, from, society, since, they, are, afraid, of, the, incomprehension, and, of, social, exclusion, in, contrast, to, frameworks, seeking, to, explain, sadomasochism, through, psychological, psychoanalytic, medical, or, forensic, approaches, which, seek, to, categorize, behaviour, and, desires, and, find, a, root, cause, romana, byrne, suggests, that, such, practices, can, be, seen, as, examples, of, aesthetic, sexuality, in, which, a, founding, physiological, or, psychological, impulse, is, irrelevant, rather, sadism, and, masochism, may, be, practiced, through, choice, and, deliberation, driven, by, certain, aesthetic, goals, tied, to, style, pleasure, and, identity, these, practices, in, certain, circumstances, and, contexts, can, be, compared, with, the, creation, of, art, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, symbols, of, the, bdsm, community, is, a, derivation, of, a, triskelion, shape, within, a, circle, various, forms, of, triskele, have, had, many, uses, and, many, meanings, in, many, cultures, its, bdsm, usage, derives, from, the, ring, of, o, in, the, classic, book, story, of, o, the, bdsm, emblem, project, claims, copyright, over, one, particular, specified, form, of, the, triskelion, symbol, other, variants, of, the, triskelion, are, free, from, such, copyright, claims, the, triskelion, as, a, bdsm, symbol, can, easily, be, perceived, as, the, three, separate, parts, of, the, acronym, bdsm, which, are, bd, ds, and, sm, bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, masochism, they, are, three, separate, items, that, are, normally, associated, together, the, leather, pride, flag, shown, to, the, right, is, a, symbol, for, the, leather, subculture, and, also, widely, used, within, bdsm, in, continental, europe, the, ring, of, o, is, widespread, among, bdsm, practitioners, the, bdsm, rights, flag, shown, to, the, right, was, designed, by, tanos, a, master, from, the, united, kingdom, it, is, partially, loosely, based, on, the, design, of, the, leather, pride, flag, and, also, includes, a, version, of, the, bdsm, emblem, but, not, similar, enough, to, fall, within, steve, quagmyr, s, specific, copyright, claims, for, the, emblem, the, bdsm, rights, flag, is, intended, to, represent, the, belief, that, people, whose, sexuality, or, relationship, preferences, include, bdsm, practices, deserve, the, same, human, rights, as, everyone, else, and, should, not, be, discriminated, against, for, pursuing, bdsm, with, consenting, adults, the, flag, is, inspired, by, the, leather, pride, flag, and, bdsm, emblem, but, is, specifically, intended, to, represent, the, concept, of, bdsm, rights, and, to, be, without, the, other, symbols, restrictions, against, commercial, use, it, is, designed, to, be, recognizable, by, people, familiar, with, either, the, leather, pride, flag, or, bdsm, triskelion, or, triskele, as, something, to, do, with, bdsm, and, to, be, distinctive, whether, reproduced, in, full, colour, or, in, black, and, white, or, another, pair, of, colours, bdsm, and, fetish, items, and, styles, have, been, spread, widely, in, western, societies, everyday, life, by, different, factors, such, as, avant, garde, fashion, heavy, metal, goth, subculture, and, science, fiction, tv, series, and, are, often, not, consciously, connected, with, their, bdsm, roots, by, many, people, while, it, was, mainly, confined, to, the, punk, and, bdsm, subcultures, in, the, 1990s, it, has, since, spread, into, wider, parts, of, western, societies, although, it, would, be, possible, to, establish, certain, elements, related, to, bdsm, in, classical, theater, not, until, the, emergence, of, contemporary, theater, would, some, plays, have, bdsm, as, the, main, theme, exemplifying, this, are, two, works, one, austrian, one, german, in, which, bdsm, is, not, only, incorporated, but, integral, to, the, storyline, of, the, play, although, examples, of, literature, catering, to, bdsm, and, fetishistic, tastes, were, created, in, earlier, periods, bdsm, literature, as, it, exists, today, cannot, be, found, much, earlier, than, world, war, ii, the, word, sadism, originates, from, the, works, of, donatien, alphonse, fran, ois, marquis, de, sade, and, the, word, masochism, originates, from, leopold, von, sacher, masoch, the, author, of, venus, in, furs, however, it, is, worth, noting, that, the, marquis, de, sade, describes, non, consensual, abuse, in, his, works, such, as, in, justine, venus, in, furs, describes, a, consensual, dom, sub,
