weightlifting, often, known, as, olympic, weightlifting, is, a, competitive, strength, sport, in, which, athletes, compete, in, lifting, a, barbell, loaded, with, weight, plates, from, the, ground, to, overhead, with, the, aim, of, successfully, lifting, the, heaviest, weights, athletes, compete, in, two, specific, ways, of, lifting, the, barbell, overhead, the, snatch, is, a, wide, grip, lift, in, which, the, weighted, barbell, is, lifted, overhead, in, one, motion, the, clean, and, jerk, is, a, combination, lift, in, which, the, weight, is, first, taken, from, the, ground, to, the, front, of, the, shoulders, the, clean, and, then, from, the, shoulders, to, over, the, head, the, jerk, the, sport, formerly, included, a, third, lift, event, known, as, clean, and, press, each, weightlifter, gets, three, attempts, at, both, the, snatch, and, the, clean, and, jerk, with, the, snatch, attempted, first, an, athlete, s, score, is, the, combined, total, of, the, highest, successfully, lifted, weight, in, kilograms, for, each, lift, athletes, compete, in, various, weight, classes, which, are, different, for, each, sex, and, have, changed, over, time, weightlifting, is, an, olympic, sport, and, has, been, contested, in, every, summer, olympic, games, since, 1920, while, the, sport, is, officially, named, weightlifting, the, terms, olympic, weightlifting, and, olympic, style, weightlifting, are, often, used, to, distinguish, it, from, the, other, sports, and, events, that, involve, the, lifting, of, weights, such, as, powerlifting, weight, training, and, strongman, events, similarly, the, snatch, and, the, clean, and, jerk, are, known, as, the, olympic, lifts, while, other, strength, sports, test, limit, of, strength, olympic, style, weightlifting, also, tests, limits, of, human, power, explosive, strength, the, olympic, lifts, are, executed, faster, and, require, more, mobility, and, a, greater, range, of, motion, during, their, execution, than, other, barbell, lifts, the, olympic, lifts, and, their, variations, e, g, power, snatch, power, clean, as, well, as, components, of, the, olympic, lifts, e, g, cleans, squats, are, used, by, elite, athletes, in, other, sports, to, train, for, both, explosive, strength, power, and, functional, strength, the, sport, is, competed, at, local, national, and, international, levels, the, sport, is, governed, internationally, by, the, international, weightlifting, federation, iwf, which, runs, the, world, weightlifting, championships, each, year, the, snatch, is, a, lift, wherein, an, athlete, sweeps, the, barbell, up, and, overhead, in, one, fluid, action, the, lifter, takes, a, wide, grip, on, the, bar, and, pulls, the, barbell, off, the, floor, before, rapidly, re, bending, their, knees, to, get, themself, under, the, barbell, usually, bringing, themself, into, a, deep, overhead, squat, position, so, that, the, barbell, is, supported, over, their, head, with, arms, outstretched, the, snatch, is, then, completed, by, the, lifter, rising, to, a, standing, position, while, holding, the, barbell, overhead, the, snatch, demands, precise, balance, the, clean, and, jerk, is, a, combination, lift, in, which, the, athlete, gets, the, barbell, overhead, in, two, stages, first, by, lifting, the, barbell, into, support, on, the, front, of, the, shoulders, a, position, known, as, the, front, rack, the, clean, and, then, lifting, it, from, shoulders, to, overhead, the, jerk, to, perform, the, clean, the, lifter, takes, a, shoulder, width, grip, on, the, bar, and, pulls, it, off, the, floor, and, then, rapidly, re, bends, their, knees, and, bends, their, arms, to, get, their, body, under, the, barbell, and, catch, the, bar, on, the, front, of, the, shoulders, usually, in, a, deep, front, squat, position, the, lifter, finishes, the, clean, by, rising, to, a, standing, position, while, holding, the, barbell, on, the, front, of, their, shoulders, the, lifter, then, uses, the, jerk, to, jump, into, a, bent, knees, position, most, commonly, with, one, foot, forward, and, the, other, back, a, technique, known, as, the, split, jerk, while, pumping, the, barbell, overhead, the, jerk, is, completed, when, the, lifter, re, straightens, the, legs, bringing, them, together, after, a, split, jerk, so, they, come, to, a, straight, standing, position, with, the, barbell, held, overhead, a, third, lift, the, clean, and, press, was, also, a, competition, lift, from, 1924, through, 1972, it, entails, a, clean, followed, by, an, overhead, press, the, overhead, press, is, distinguished, from, the, jerk, in, that, jerking, movements, bending, of, the, legs, and, displacement, of, the, feet, are, prohibited, it, was, discontinued, after, 1972, due, to, difficulties, in, judging, proper, form, athletes, compete, in, a, division, determined, by, their, body, mass, in, summer, 2018, the, iwf, approved, the, current, weight, categories, specifying, which, 7, of, the, 10, total, would, be, contested, at, the, 2020, summer, olympics, iwf, men, s, weight, classes, categories, only, five, weight, classes, were, chosen, for, paris, 2024, iwf, women, s, weight, classes, categories, weight, classes, chosen, for, paris, 2024, in, each, weight, division, lifters, compete, in, both, the, snatch, and, the, clean, and, jerk, prizes, are, usually, given, for, the, heaviest, weights, lifted, in, each, and, in, the, overall, the, maximum, lifts, of, both, added, the, order, of, the, competition, is, up, to, the, lifters, the, competitor, who, chooses, to, attempt, the, lowest, weight, goes, first, if, they, are, unsuccessful, at, that, weight, they, have, the, option, of, reattempting, at, that, weight, or, trying, a, heavier, weight, after, any, other, competitors, have, made, attempts, at, the, previous, weight, or, any, other, intermediate, weights, the, barbell, is, loaded, incrementally, and, progresses, to, a, heavier, weight, throughout, the, course, of, competition, weights, are, set, in, 1, kilogram, increments, if, two, athletes, lift, the, same, weight, they, are, both, credited, with, it, but, in, terms, of, placing, the, one, who, lifted, the, weight, first, gets, the, highest, placing, during, competition, the, snatch, event, takes, place, first, followed, by, a, short, intermission, and, then, the, clean, and, jerk, event, there, are, two, side, judges, and, one, head, referee, who, together, provide, a, successful, or, failed, result, for, each, attempt, based, on, their, observation, of, the, lift, within, the, governing, body, s, rules, and, regulations, two, successes, are, required, for, any, attempt, to, pass, usually, the, judges, and, referee, s, results, are, registered, via, a, lighting, system, with, a, white, light, indicating, a, successful, lift, and, a, red, light, indicating, a, failed, lift, this, is, done, for, the, benefit, of, all, in, attendance, be, they, athlete, coach, administrator, or, audience, in, addition, one, or, two, technical, officials, may, be, present, to, advise, during, a, ruling, lifters, who, fail, to, successfully, complete, at, least, one, snatch, and, at, least, one, clean, and, jerk, fail, to, total, and, receive, an, incomplete, entry, for, the, competition, at, local, competitions, a, best, lifter, title, is, commonly, awarded, it, is, awarded, to, both, the, best, men, s, and, women, s, lifters, the, award, is, based, on, a, formula, which, employs, the, sinclair, coefficient, a, coefficient, derived, and, approved, by, the, sport, s, world, governing, body, which, allows, for, differences, in, both, gender, and, bodyweight, when, the, formula, is, applied, to, each, lifter, s, overall, total, and, then, grouped, along, with, the, other, competitors, and, evaluated, it, provides, a, numeric, result, which, determines, the, competition, s, best, overall, men, s, and, women, s, lifters, and, while, usually, the, winner, of, the, heaviest, weight, class, will, have, lifted, the, most, overall, weight, during, the, course, of, a, competition, a, lifter, in, a, lighter, weight, class, may, still, have, lifted, more, weight, both, relative, to, their, own, bodyweight, and, to, the, sinclair, coefficient, formula, thereby, garnering, the, best, lifter, award, competitions, to, establish, who, can, lift, the, heaviest, weight, have, been, recorded, throughout, civilization, with, the, earliest, known, recordings, including, those, found, in, egypt, china, india, and, ancient, greece, the, international, sport, of, weightlifting, began, with, the, first, world, weightlifting, championships, in, 1891, in, london, with, edward, lawrence, levy, becoming, the, first, world, champion, in, 1896, the, inaugural, olympic, games, in, athens, included, weightlifting, in, the, field, event, the, predecessor, to, today, s, track, and, field, or, athletics, event, in, the, early, olympic, games, a, distinction, was, drawn, between, lifting, with, one, hand, only, and, lifting, with, two, hands, and, all, competitors, competed, together, regardless, of, their, size, and, weight, the, winner, of, the, one, hand, competition, in, 1896, was, launceston, elliot, of, scotland, while, the, winner, of, the, two, hands, event, was, viggo, jensen, of, denmark, further, world, weightlifting, championships, followed, in, 1898, in, austria, 1899, in, milan, and, 1903, in, paris, with, the, international, weightlifting, federation, being, founded, in, 1905, weightlifting, was, next, contested, at, the, olympics, in, the, 1904, games, again, in, athletics, and, at, the, 1906, intercalated, games, but, was, omitted, from, the, games, of, 1900, 1908, and, 1912, 1912, being, the, last, games, until, after, the, first, world, war, in, 1920, weightlifting, returned, to, the, olympics, and, for, the, first, time, as, an, event, in, its, own, right, and, weightlifting, has, been, contested, at, every, summer, olympics, games, since, the, 1920, games, took, place, at, antwerp, in, belgium, and, fourteen, nations, competed, the, competition, lifts, were, the, one, hand, snatch, the, one, hand, clean, and, jerk, and, the, two, hands, clean, and, jerk, at, the, next, olympic, games, in, paris, in, 1924, the, two, hands, press, and, the, two, hands, snatch, were, added, to, the, program, making, a, total, of, five, lifts, and, weight, classes, were, introduced, for, competitors, with, weightlifters, competing, in, five, weight, divisions, in, 1928, the, sport, dropped, the, one, hand, exercises, going, forward, with, three, two, hand, exercises, the, snatch, the, clean, and, press, and, the, clean, and, jerk, the, 1972, olympics, was, the, last, olympics, featuring, the, clean, and, press, as, difficulties, in, judging, proper, form, led, to, it, being, dropped, from, subsequent, competitions, athletes, rather, than, strictly, pressing, the, weight, overhead, with, an, upright, torso, had, been, using, their, hips, and, leaning, backward, substantially, some, athletes, were, able, to, initiate, the, press, with, a, hip, thrust, so, rapid, that, judges, found, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, or, not, they, had, utilized, any, knee, bend, to, generate, additional, force, something, strictly, prohibited, in, the, rules, also, prohibited, was, excessive, layback, leaning, back, too, much, but, it, was, considered, too, difficult, to, determine, what, degree, of, layback, constituted, a, rule, violation, as, a, result, the, clean, and, press, was, discontinued, as, a, competition, lift, after, 1972, since, the, 1973, world, weightlifting, championships, weightlifting, competitions, have, been, biathlons, of, the, snatch, and, the, clean, and, jerk, with, the, 1976, olympics, being, the, first, olympics, in, this, format, in, 1987, women, s, world, championship, events, were, included, for, the, first, time, in, iwf, s, annual, world, weightlifting, championships, with, women, such, as, karyn, marshall, us, and, cai, jun, china, amongst, the, winners, in, that, first, year, yet, it, was, not, until, the, 2000, olympic, games, in, sydney, australia, that, women, s, weightlifting, was, incorporated, into, the, olympics, china, s, chen, yanqing, became, an, early, star, of, women, s, weightlifting, at, the, olympics, as, she, won, olympic, gold, two, games, in, a, row, in, 2004, and, 2008, in, 2011, the, international, weightlifting, federation, iwf, ruled, that, athletes, could, wear, a, full, body, unitard, under, the, customary, weightlifting, uniform, kulsoom, abdullah, became, the, first, woman, to, do, so, at, the, u, s, national, championships, that, year, and, athletes, are, allowed, to, do, so, at, the, olympics, iwf, rules, previously, stated, that, an, athlete, s, knees, and, elbows, must, be, visible, so, officials, can, determine, if, a, lift, is, correctly, executed, olympic, weightlifting, uses, a, steel, bar, also, known, as, a, barbell, with, larger, diameter, rotating, sleeves, on, either, end, holding, rubber, coated, weight, plates, of, different, weights, this, sleeve, rotation, is, important, for, the, olympic, lifts, particularly, the, snatch, and, clean, movements, because, it, drastically, reduces, the, rotational, inertia, of, the, bar, without, sleeve, rotation, the, olympic, lifter, faces, more, challenging, lifts, and, a, greater, risk, of, injury, a, men, s, olympic, barbell, weighs, 20, kg, 44, lbs, with, a, shaft, diameter, of, 28, mm, and, a, length, of, 2200, mm, whereas, a, women, s, olympic, barbell, weighs, 15, kg, 33, lbs, and, has, a, shaft, diameter, of, 25, mm, with, a, length, of, 2010, mm, the, distance, between, the, sleeves, however, is, the, same, for, the, men, s, and, the, women, s, bars, at, 1310, mm, the, grip, texture, of, the, bar, is, called, the, knurling, and, is, distributed, differently, between, the, men, s, and, women, s, bars, the, men, s, has, knurling, in, the, center, but, the, women, s, does, not, the, olympic, barbells, used, in, competition, are, certified, by, the, iwf, the, weight, plates, typically, referred, to, as, bumper, plates, because, of, their, rubber, coated, design, weigh, between, 10, kg, and, 25, kg, in, 5, kg, increments, the, bumper, plates, are, coated, with, rubber, to, allow, the, weights, to, be, dropped, from, various, heights, either, after, a, successful, lift, or, during, an, unsuccessful, one, olympic, bumper, plates, conform, to, international, standards, for, coloring, that, is, 10, kg, is, green, 15, kg, is, yellow, 20, kg, is, blue, and, 25, kg, is, red, in, addition, to, the, rubber, bumpers, smaller, competition, iron, plates, can, be, used, to, add, weight, in, small, increments, to, the, bar, the, color, designations, for, these, iron, plates, are, as, follows, 1, kg, is, green, 1, 5, kg, is, yellow, 2, kg, is, blue, 2, 5, kg, is, red, 5, kg, and, 0, 5, kg, are, white, it, is, useful, to, note, the, color, assignment, of, these, iron, plates, is, consistent, with, the, heavier, bumper, plates, i, e, 1, kg, and, 10, kg, are, green, 1, 5, kg, and, 15, kg, are, yellow, etc, weight, plates, are, secured, to, the, bar, using, collars, on, each, sleeve, that, weigh, exactly, 2, 5, kg, each, lifters, typically, wear, a, one, piece, close, fitting, leotard, often, called, a, singlet, the, wearing, of, a, t, shirt, underneath, the, singlet, is, optional, a, weightlifting, belt, of, 120, mm, maximum, width, may, also, be, worn, to, increase, intra, abdominal, pressure, chalk, is, regularly, used, by, olympic, lifters, generally, prior, to, each, attempt, at, a, lift, lifters, rub, their, hands, with, the, chalk, to, promote, dryness, and, prevent, the, bar, moving, in, their, hands, olympic, lifters, frequently, use, tape, to, cover, the, areas, of, their, bodies, exposed, to, friction, while, completing, olympic, lifts, tape, is, most, commonly, found, on, the, olympic, lifter, s, thumb, a, taped, thumb, not, only, lessens, the, risk, of, calluses, but, it, also, reduces, the, pain, associated, with, the, hook, grip, olympic, lifters, also, tape, their, wrists, preventing, exaggerated, and, uncomfortable, joint, movement, during, lifts, for, particularly, heavy, overhead, lifts, a, taped, wrist, enables, the, lifter, to, regulate, wrist, extension, and, delimit, the, translation, of, the, radius, and, ulna, distal, heads, however, while, taped, wrists, can, prevent, wrist, and, forearm, injuries, in, the, short, term, excessive, use, can, lead, to, weakened, connective, tissue, in, the, area, increasing, the, risk, of, pain, and, injury, the, type, of, shoes, worn, by, olympic, weightlifters, is, perhaps, their, most, distinctive, piece, of, equipment, weightlifting, shoes, are, typically, designed, with, a, raised, heel, of, 0, 5, to, 1, 5, and, one, or, two, metatarsal, straps, that, tighten, across, the, instep, of, the, shoe, the, raised, heel, helps, the, lifter, maintain, an, upright, torso, while, catching, the, bar, and, also, allows, for, a, deeper, squat, under, the, bar, the, soles, of, the, shoes, are, also, quite, rigid, helping, to, resist, compression, while, under, heavy, loads, the, shoes, are, designed, for, maximum, stability, while, remaining, flexible, in, the, toe, box, this, allows, the, lifter, to, come, up, on, the, toes, and, to, catch, the, weight, on, the, ball, of, the, back, foot, during, the, jerk, movement, of, the, lift, there, are, also, different, heel, constructions, most, modern, weightlifting, shoes, use, a, hard, tpu, plastic, heel, that, does, not, deform, and, is, more, durable, than, other, materials, however, there, has, been, a, resurgence, in, premium, shoes, using, retro, wood, heels, which, are, hard, but, do, not, last, as, long, knee, sleeves, some, weightlifters, may, use, knee, sleeves, to, provide, joint, support, and, assist, in, standing, from, the, deep, squatting, position, wrist, wraps, wrist, wraps, are, commonly, used, to, provide, support, to, the, joint
