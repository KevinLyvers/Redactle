drinking, water, or, potable, water, is, water, that, is, safe, for, ingestion, either, when, drunk, directly, in, liquid, form, or, consumed, indirectly, through, food, preparation, it, is, often, but, not, always, supplied, through, taps, in, which, case, it, is, also, called, tap, water, typically, in, developed, countries, tap, water, meets, drinking, water, quality, standards, even, though, only, a, small, proportion, is, actually, consumed, or, used, in, food, preparation, other, typical, uses, for, tap, water, include, washing, toilets, and, irrigation, greywater, may, also, be, used, for, toilets, or, irrigation, its, use, for, irrigation, however, may, be, associated, with, risks, the, amount, of, drinking, water, required, to, maintain, good, health, varies, and, depends, on, physical, activity, level, age, health, related, issues, and, environmental, conditions, for, those, who, work, in, a, hot, climate, up, to, 16, litres, 4, 2, us, gal, a, day, may, be, required, globally, by, 2015, 89, of, people, had, access, to, water, from, a, source, that, is, suitable, for, drinking, called, improved, water, sources, in, sub, saharan, africa, access, to, potable, water, ranged, from, 40, to, 80, of, the, population, nearly, 4, 2, billion, people, worldwide, had, access, to, tap, water, while, another, 2, 4, billion, had, access, to, wells, or, public, taps, the, world, health, organization, considers, access, to, safe, drinking, water, a, basic, human, right, about, 1, to, 2, billion, people, lack, safe, drinking, water, water, can, carry, vectors, of, disease, more, people, die, from, unsafe, water, than, from, war, then, u, n, secretary, general, ban, ki, moon, said, in, 2010, developing, countries, are, most, affected, by, unsafe, drinking, water, potable, water, is, available, in, almost, all, populated, areas, of, the, earth, although, it, may, be, expensive, and, the, supply, may, not, always, be, sustainable, sources, where, drinking, water, is, commonly, obtained, include, springs, hyporheic, zones, and, aquifers, groundwater, from, rainwater, harvesting, surface, water, from, rivers, streams, glaciers, or, desalinated, seawater, for, these, water, sources, to, be, consumed, safely, they, must, receive, adequate, water, treatment, and, meet, drinking, water, quality, standards, an, experimental, source, is, atmospheric, water, generators, springs, are, often, used, as, sources, for, bottled, waters, the, most, efficient, and, convenient, way, to, transport, and, deliver, potable, water, is, through, pipes, plumbing, can, require, significant, capital, investment, some, systems, suffer, high, operating, costs, the, cost, to, replace, the, deteriorating, water, and, sanitation, infrastructure, of, industrialized, countries, may, be, as, high, as, 200, billion, a, year, leakage, of, untreated, and, treated, water, from, pipes, reduces, access, to, water, leakage, rates, of, 50, are, not, uncommon, in, urban, systems, tap, water, delivered, by, domestic, water, systems, refers, to, water, piped, to, homes, and, delivered, to, a, tap, or, spigot, in, the, united, states, the, typical, water, consumption, per, capita, at, home, is, 69, 3, us, gallons, 262, l, 57, 7, imp, gal, of, water, per, day, of, this, only, 1, of, the, water, provided, by, public, water, suppliers, is, for, drinking, and, cooking, uses, include, in, decreasing, order, toilets, washing, machines, showers, baths, faucets, and, leaks, as, of, 2015, american, households, use, an, average, of, 300, gallons, of, water, a, day, the, qualitative, and, quantitative, aspects, of, drinking, water, requirements, on, domesticated, animals, are, studied, and, described, within, the, context, of, animal, husbandry, however, relatively, few, studies, have, been, focused, on, the, drinking, behavior, of, wild, animals, according, to, the, world, health, organization, s, 2017, report, safe, drinking, water, is, water, that, does, not, represent, any, significant, risk, to, health, over, a, lifetime, of, consumption, including, different, sensitivities, that, may, occur, between, life, stages, 2, according, to, a, report, by, unicef, and, unesco, finland, has, the, best, drinking, water, quality, in, the, world, parameters, for, drinking, water, quality, typically, fall, within, three, categories, microbiological, chemical, physical, microbiological, parameters, include, coliform, bacteria, e, coli, and, specific, pathogenic, species, of, bacteria, such, as, cholera, causing, vibrio, cholerae, viruses, and, protozoan, parasites, originally, fecal, contamination, was, determined, with, the, presence, of, coliform, bacteria, a, convenient, marker, for, a, class, of, harmful, fecal, pathogens, the, presence, of, fecal, coliforms, like, e, coli, serves, as, an, indication, of, contamination, by, sewage, additional, contaminants, include, protozoan, oocysts, such, as, cryptosporidium, sp, giardia, lamblia, legionella, and, viruses, enteric, microbial, pathogenic, parameters, are, typically, of, greatest, concern, because, of, their, immediate, health, risk, physical, and, chemical, parameters, include, heavy, metals, trace, organic, compounds, total, suspended, solids, and, turbidity, chemical, parameters, tend, to, pose, more, of, a, chronic, health, risk, through, buildup, of, heavy, metals, although, some, components, like, nitrates, nitrites, and, arsenic, can, have, a, more, immediate, impact, physical, parameters, affect, the, aesthetics, and, taste, of, the, drinking, water, and, may, complicate, the, removal, of, microbial, pathogens, pesticides, are, also, potential, drinking, water, contaminants, of, the, category, chemical, contaminants, pesticides, may, be, present, in, drinking, water, in, low, concentrations, but, the, toxicity, of, the, chemical, and, the, extent, of, human, exposure, are, factors, that, are, used, to, determine, the, specific, health, risk, perfluorinated, alkylated, substances, pfas, are, a, group, of, synthetic, compounds, used, in, a, large, variety, of, consumer, products, such, as, food, packaging, waterproof, fabrics, carpeting, and, cookware, pfas, are, known, to, persist, in, the, environment, and, are, commonly, described, as, persistent, organic, pollutants, pfas, chemicals, have, been, detected, in, blood, both, humans, and, animals, worldwide, as, well, as, in, food, products, water, air, and, soil, animal, testing, studies, with, pfas, have, shown, effects, on, growth, and, development, and, possibly, effects, on, reproduction, thyroid, the, immune, system, and, liver, as, of, 2022, the, health, impacts, of, many, pfas, compounds, are, not, understood, scientists, are, conducting, research, to, determine, the, extent, and, severity, of, impacts, from, pfas, on, human, health, pfas, have, been, widely, detected, in, drinking, water, worldwide, and, regulations, have, been, developed, or, are, under, development, in, many, countries, drinking, water, quality, standards, describes, the, quality, parameters, set, for, drinking, water, water, may, contain, many, harmful, constituents, yet, there, are, no, universally, recognized, and, accepted, international, standards, for, drinking, water, even, where, standards, do, exist, the, permitted, concentration, of, individual, constituents, may, vary, by, as, much, as, ten, times, from, one, set, of, standards, to, another, many, countries, specify, standards, to, be, applied, in, their, own, country, in, europe, this, includes, the, european, drinking, water, directive, and, in, the, united, states, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, establishes, standards, as, required, by, the, safe, drinking, water, act, china, adopted, its, own, drinking, water, standard, gb3838, 2002, type, ii, enacted, by, ministry, of, environmental, protection, in, 2002, for, countries, without, a, legislative, or, administrative, framework, for, such, standards, the, world, health, organization, publishes, guidelines, on, the, standards, that, should, be, achieved, contaminated, water, is, estimated, to, result, in, more, than, half, a, million, deaths, per, year, contaminated, water, together, with, the, lack, of, sanitation, was, estimated, to, cause, about, one, percent, of, disability, adjusted, life, years, worldwide, in, 2010, according, to, the, who, the, most, common, diseases, linked, with, poor, water, quality, are, cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis, a, typhoid, and, polio, one, of, the, main, causes, for, contaminated, drinking, water, in, developing, countries, is, lack, of, sanitation, and, poor, hygiene, for, this, reason, the, quantification, of, the, burden, of, disease, from, consuming, contaminated, drinking, water, usually, looks, at, water, sanitation, and, hygiene, aspects, together, the, acronym, for, this, is, wash, standing, for, water, sanitation, and, hygiene, the, who, has, investigated, which, proportion, of, death, and, disease, worldwide, can, be, attributed, to, insufficient, wash, services, in, their, analysis, they, focus, on, the, following, four, health, outcomes, diarrhea, acute, respiratory, infections, undernutrition, and, soil, transmitted, helminthiases, sths, vi, these, health, outcomes, are, also, included, as, an, indicator, for, achieving, sustainable, development, goal, 3, good, health, and, wellbeing, indicator, 3, 9, 2, reports, on, the, mortality, rate, attributed, to, unsafe, water, sanitation, and, lack, of, hygiene, diarrhea, is, primarily, transmitted, through, fecal, oral, routes, in, 2011, infectious, diarrhea, resulted, in, about, 0, 7, million, deaths, in, children, under, five, years, old, and, 250, million, lost, school, days, this, equates, to, about, 2000, child, deaths, per, day, children, suffering, from, diarrhea, are, more, vulnerable, to, become, underweight, due, to, stunted, growth, this, makes, them, more, vulnerable, to, other, diseases, such, as, acute, respiratory, infections, and, malaria, chronic, diarrhea, can, have, a, negative, effect, on, child, development, both, physical, and, cognitive, sixty, million, people, are, estimated, to, have, been, poisoned, by, well, water, contaminated, by, excessive, fluoride, which, dissolved, from, granite, rocks, the, effects, are, particularly, evident, in, the, bone, deformations, of, children, similar, or, larger, problems, are, anticipated, in, other, countries, including, china, uzbekistan, and, ethiopia, although, helpful, for, dental, health, in, low, dosage, fluoride, in, large, amounts, interferes, with, bone, formation, long, term, consumption, of, water, with, high, fluoride, concentration, 1, 5, ppm, f, can, have, serious, undesirable, consequences, such, as, dental, fluorosis, enamel, mottle, and, skeletal, fluorosis, bone, deformities, in, children, fluorosis, severity, depends, on, how, much, fluoride, is, present, in, the, water, as, well, as, people, s, diet, and, physical, activity, defluoridation, methods, include, membrane, based, methods, precipitation, absorption, and, electrocoagulation, natural, arsenic, contamination, of, groundwater, is, a, global, threat, with, 140, million, people, affected, in, 70, countries, globally, some, well, known, examples, of, water, quality, problems, with, drinking, water, supplies, include, water, supply, can, get, contaminated, by, pathogens, which, may, originate, from, human, excreta, for, example, due, to, a, breakdown, or, design, fault, in, the, sanitation, system, or, by, chemical, contaminants, further, examples, of, contamination, include, examples, of, chemical, contamination, include, most, water, requires, some, treatment, before, use, even, water, from, deep, wells, or, springs, the, extent, of, treatment, depends, on, the, source, of, the, water, appropriate, technology, options, in, water, treatment, include, both, community, scale, and, household, scale, point, of, use, pou, designs, only, a, few, large, urban, areas, such, as, christchurch, new, zealand, have, access, to, sufficiently, pure, water, of, sufficient, volume, that, no, treatment, of, the, raw, water, is, required, in, emergency, situations, when, conventional, treatment, systems, have, been, compromised, waterborne, pathogens, may, be, killed, or, inactivated, by, boiling, but, this, requires, abundant, sources, of, fuel, and, can, be, very, onerous, on, consumers, especially, where, it, is, difficult, to, store, boiled, water, in, sterile, conditions, other, techniques, such, as, filtration, chemical, disinfection, and, exposure, to, ultraviolet, radiation, including, solar, uv, have, been, demonstrated, in, an, array, of, randomized, control, trials, to, significantly, reduce, levels, of, water, borne, disease, among, users, in, low, income, countries, but, these, suffer, from, the, same, problems, as, boiling, methods, another, type, of, water, treatment, is, called, desalination, and, is, used, mainly, in, dry, areas, with, access, to, large, bodies, of, saltwater, publicly, available, treated, water, has, historically, been, associated, with, major, increases, in, life, expectancy, and, improved, public, health, water, disinfection, can, greatly, reduce, the, risks, of, waterborne, diseases, such, as, typhoid, and, cholera, chlorination, is, currently, the, most, widely, used, water, disinfection, method, although, chlorine, compounds, can, react, with, substances, in, water, and, produce, disinfection, by, products, dbp, that, pose, problems, to, human, health, local, geological, conditions, affecting, groundwater, are, determining, factors, for, the, presence, of, various, metal, ions, often, rendering, the, water, soft, or, hard, in, the, event, of, contamination, of, drinking, water, government, officials, typically, issue, an, advisory, regarding, water, consumption, in, the, case, of, biological, contamination, residents, are, usually, advised, to, boil, their, water, before, consumption, or, to, use, bottled, water, as, an, alternative, in, the, case, of, chemical, contamination, residents, may, be, advised, to, refrain, from, consuming, tap, water, entirely, until, the, matter, is, resolved, the, ability, of, point, of, use, pou, options, to, reduce, disease, is, a, function, of, both, their, ability, to, remove, microbial, pathogens, if, properly, applied, and, such, social, factors, as, ease, of, use, and, cultural, appropriateness, technologies, may, generate, more, or, less, health, benefit, than, their, lab, based, microbial, removal, performance, would, suggest, the, current, priority, of, the, proponents, of, pou, treatment, is, to, reach, large, numbers, of, low, income, households, on, a, sustainable, basis, few, pou, measures, have, reached, significant, scale, thus, far, but, efforts, to, promote, and, commercially, distribute, these, products, to, the, world, s, poor, have, only, been, under, way, for, a, few, years, solar, water, disinfection, is, a, low, cost, method, of, purifying, water, that, can, often, be, implemented, with, locally, available, materials, unlike, methods, that, rely, on, firewood, it, has, low, impact, on, the, environment, in, many, areas, low, concentration, of, fluoride, 1, 0, ppm, f, is, intentionally, added, to, tap, water, to, improve, dental, health, although, in, some, communities, water, fluoridation, remains, a, controversial, issue, see, water, fluoridation, controversy, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, access, to, safe, drinking, water, is, essential, to, health, a, basic, human, right, and, a, component, of, effective, policy, for, health, protection, 2, in, 1990, only, 76, percent, of, the, global, population, had, access, to, drinking, water, by, 2015, that, number, had, increased, to, 91, percent, in, 1990, most, countries, in, latin, america, east, and, south, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, were, well, below, 90, in, sub, saharan, africa, where, the, rates, are, lowest, household, access, ranges, from, 40, to, 80, percent, countries, that, experience, violent, conflict, can, have, reductions, in, drinking, water, access, one, study, found, that, a, conflict, with, about, 2, 500, battle, deaths, deprives, 1, 8, of, the, population, of, potable, water, by, 2015, 5, 2, billion, people, representing, 71, of, the, global, population, used, safely, managed, drinking, water, services, as, of, 2017, 90, of, people, having, access, to, water, from, a, source, that, is, suitable, for, drinking, called, improved, water, source, and, 71, of, the, world, could, access, safely, managed, drinking, water, that, is, clean, and, available, on, demand, estimates, suggest, that, at, least, 25, of, improved, sources, contain, fecal, contamination, 1, 8, billion, people, still, use, an, unsafe, drinking, water, source, which, may, be, contaminated, by, feces, this, can, result, in, infectious, diseases, such, as, gastroenteritis, cholera, and, typhoid, among, others, reduction, of, waterborne, diseases, and, development, of, safe, water, resources, is, a, major, public, health, goal, in, developing, countries, in, 2017, almost, 22, million, americans, drank, from, water, systems, that, were, in, violation, of, public, health, standards, which, could, contribute, to, citizens, developing, water, borne, illnesses, safe, drinking, water, is, an, environmental, health, concern, bottled, water, is, sold, for, public, consumption, in, most, parts, of, the, world, improved, sources, are, also, monitored, based, on, whether, water, is, available, when, needed, 5, 8, billion, people, located, on, premises, 5, 4, billion, free, from, contamination, 5, 4, billion, and, within, a, 30, minute, round, trip, 3, while, improved, water, sources, such, as, protected, piped, water, are, more, likely, to, provide, safe, and, adequate, water, as, they, may, prevent, contact, with, human, excreta, for, example, this, is, not, always, the, case, according, to, a, 2014, study, approximately, 25, of, improved, sources, contained, fecal, contamination, the, population, in, australia, new, zealand, north, america, and, europe, have, achieved, nearly, universal, basic, drinking, water, services, 3, because, of, the, high, initial, investments, many, less, wealthy, nations, cannot, afford, to, develop, or, sustain, appropriate, infrastructure, and, as, a, consequence, people, in, these, areas, may, spend, a, correspondingly, higher, fraction, of, their, income, on, water, 2003, statistics, from, el, salvador, for, example, indicate, that, the, poorest, 20, of, households, spend, more, than, 10, of, their, total, income, on, water, in, the, united, kingdom, authorities, define, spending, of, more, than, 3, of, one, s, income, on, water, as, a, hardship, the, who, unicef, joint, monitoring, program, jmp, for, water, supply, and, sanitation, is, the, official, united, nations, mechanism, tasked, with, monitoring, progress, towards, the, millennium, development, goal, mdg, relating, to, drinking, water, and, sanitation, mdg, 7, target, 7c, which, is, to, halve, by, 2015, the, proportion, of, people, without, sustainable, access, to, safe, drinking, water, and, basic, sanitation, access, to, safe, drinking, water, is, indicated, by, safe, water, sources, these, improved, drinking, water, sources, include, household, connection, public, standpipe, borehole, condition, protected, dug, well, protected, spring, and, rain, water, collection, sources, that, do, not, encourage, improved, drinking, water, to, the, same, extent, as, previously, mentioned, include, unprotected, wells, unprotected, springs, rivers, or, ponds, vender, provided, water, bottled, water, consequential, of, limitations, in, quantity, not, quality, of, water, and, tanker, truck, water, access, to, sanitary, water, comes, hand, in, hand, with, access, to, improved, sanitation, facilities, for, excreta, such, as, connection, to, public, sewer, connection, to, septic, system, or, a, pit, latrine, with, a, slab, or, water, seal, according, to, this, indicator, on, improved, water, sources, the, mdg, was, met, in, 2010, five, years, ahead, of, schedule, over, 2, billion, more, people, used, improved, drinking, water, sources, in, 2010, than, did, in, 1990, however, the, job, is, far, from, finished, 780, million, people, are, still, without, improved, sources, of, drinking, water, and, many, more, people, still, lack, safe, drinking, water, estimates, suggest, that, at, least, 25, of, improved, sources, contain, fecal, contamination, and, an, estimated, 1, 8, billion, people, globally, use, a, source, of, drinking, water, that, suffers, from, fecal, contamination, the, quality, of, these, sources, varies, over, time, and, often, gets, worse, during, the, wet, season, continued, efforts, are, needed, to, reduce, urban, rural, disparities, and, inequities, associated, with, poverty, to, dramatically, increase, safe, drinking, water, coverage, in, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, oceania, to, promote, global, monitoring, of, drinking, water, quality, and, to, look, beyond, the, mdg, target, towards, universal, coverage, guidelines, for, the, assessment, and, improvement, of, service, activities, relating, to, drinking, water, have, been, published, in, the, form, of, drinking, water, quality, standards, such, as, iso, 24510, for, example, the, eu, sets, legislation, on, water, quality, directive, 2000, 60, ec, of, the, european, parliament, and, of, the, council, of, 23, october, 2000, establishing, a, framework, for, community, action, in, the, field, of, water, policy, known, as, the, water, framework, directive, is, the, primary, piece, of, legislation, governing, water, this, drinking, water, directive, relates, specifically, to, water, intended, for, human, consumption, each, member, state, is, responsible, for, establishing, the, required, policing, measures, to, ensure, that, the, legislation, is, implemented, for, example, in, the, uk, the, water, quality, regulations, prescribe, maximum, values, for, substances, that, affect, wholesomeness, and, the, drinking, water, inspectorate, polices, the, water, companies, to, improve, water, quality, japan, s, ministry, of, health, revised, its, water, quality, standards, which, were, implemented, in, april, 2004, numerous, professionals, developed, the, drinking, water, standards, they, also, determined, ways, to, manage, the, high, quality, water, system, in, 2008, improved, regulations, were, conducted, to, improve, the, water, quality, and, reduce, the, risk, of, water, contamination, the, water, services, act, 2021, brought, taumata, arowai, into, existence, as, the, new, regulator, of, drinking, water, and, waste, water, treatment, in, new, zealand, initial, activities, including, the, establishment, of, a, national, register, of, water, suppliers, and, establishing, a, network, of, accredited, laboratories, for, drinking, water, and, waste, water, analysis, singapore, is, a, significant, importer, of, water, from, neighbouring, malaysia, but, also, has, made, great, efforts, to, reclaim, as, much, used, water, as, possible, to, ensure, adequate, provision, for, the, very, crowded, city, state, their, reclaimed, water, is, marketed, as, newater, singapore, updated, its, water, quality, regulation, in, 2019, setting, standards, consistent, with, the, who, recommended, standards, monitoring, is, undertaken, by, the, environmental, public, health, department, of, the, singaporean, government, in, the, united, kingdom, regulation, of, water, supplies, is, a, devolved, matter, to, the, welsh, and, scottish, parliaments, and, the, northern, ireland, assembly, in, england, and, wales, there, are, two, water, industry, regulatory, authorities, the, functions, and, duties, of, the, bodies, are, formally, defined, in, the, water, industry, act, 1991, 1991, c, 56, as, amended, by, the, water, act, 2003, 2003, c, 37, and, the, water, act, 2014, 2014, c, 21, in, scotland, water, quality, is, the, responsibility, of, independent, drinking, water, quality, regulator, dwqr, in, northern, ireland, the, drinking, water, inspectorate, dwi, regulates, drinking, water, quality, of, public, and, private, supplies, the, current, standards, of, water, quality, are, defined, in, the, water, supply, water, quality, regulations, northern, ireland, 2017, drinking, water, quality, in, the, united, states, is, generally, safe, in, 2016, over, 90, percent, of, the, nation, s, community, water, systems, were, in, compliance, with, all, published, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, us, epa, standards, over, 286, million, americans, get, their, tap, water, from, a, community, water, system, eight, percent, of, the, community, water, systems, large, municipal, water, systems, provide, water, to, 82, percent, of, the, us, population, the, safe, drinking, water, act, requires, the, us, epa, to, set, standards, for, drinking, water, quality, in, public, water, systems, entities, that, provide, water, for, human, consumption, to, at, least, 25, people, for, at, least, 60, days, a, year, enforcement, of, the, standards, is, mostly, carried, out, by, state, health, agencies, states, may, set, standards, that, are, more, stringent, than, the, federal, standards, drinking, water, quality, in, the, u, s, is, regulated, by, state, and, federal, laws, and, codes, which, set, maximum, contaminant, levels, mcls, and, treatment, technique, requirements, for, some, pollutants, and, naturally, occurring, constituents, determine, various, operational, requirements, require, public, notification, for, violation, of, standards, provide, guidance, to, state, primacy, agencies, and, require, utilities, to, publish, consumer, confidence, reports, in, drinking, water, access, quality, and, quantity, are, both, important, parameters, but, the, quantity, is, often, prioritized, throughout, human, history, water, quality, has, been, a, constant, and, ongoing, challenge, certain, crises, have, led, to, major, changes, in, knowledge, policy, and, regulatory, structures, the, drivers, of, change, can, vary, the, cholera, epidemic, in, the, 1850s, in, london, led, john, snow, to, further, our, understanding, of, waterborne, diseases, however, london, s, sanitary, revolution, was, driven, by, political, motivations, and, social, priorities, before, the, science, was, accepted
