family, planning, is, the, consideration, of, the, number, of, children, a, person, wishes, to, have, including, the, choice, to, have, no, children, and, the, age, at, which, they, wish, to, have, them, things, that, may, play, a, role, on, family, planning, decisions, include, marital, situation, career, or, work, considerations, financial, situations, if, sexually, active, family, planning, may, involve, the, use, of, contraception, birth, control, and, other, techniques, to, control, the, timing, of, reproduction, other, aspects, of, family, planning, aside, from, contraception, include, sex, education, prevention, and, management, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, pre, conception, counseling, and, management, and, infertility, management, family, planning, as, defined, by, the, united, nations, and, the, world, health, organization, encompasses, services, leading, up, to, conception, abortion, is, not, typically, recommended, as, a, primary, method, of, family, planning, family, planning, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, or, euphemism, for, access, to, and, the, use, of, contraception, however, it, often, involves, methods, and, practices, in, addition, to, contraception, additionally, many, might, wish, to, use, contraception, but, are, not, necessarily, planning, a, family, e, g, unmarried, adolescents, young, married, couples, delaying, childbearing, while, building, a, career, family, planning, has, become, a, catch, all, phrase, for, much, of, the, work, undertaken, in, this, realm, however, contemporary, notions, of, family, planning, tend, to, place, a, woman, and, her, childbearing, decisions, at, the, center, of, the, discussion, as, notions, of, women, s, empowerment, and, reproductive, autonomy, have, gained, traction, in, many, parts, of, the, world, it, is, usually, applied, to, a, female, male, couple, who, wish, to, limit, the, number, of, children, they, have, or, control, pregnancy, timing, also, known, as, spacing, children, family, planning, has, been, shown, to, reduce, teenage, birth, rates, and, birth, rates, for, unmarried, women, in, 2006, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, issued, a, recommendation, encouraging, men, and, women, to, formulate, a, reproductive, life, plan, to, help, them, in, avoiding, unintended, pregnancies, and, to, improve, the, health, of, women, and, reduce, adverse, pregnancy, outcomes, there, are, multiple, benefits, to, family, planning, including, spacing, births, for, healthier, pregnancies, thus, decreasing, risks, of, maternal, morbidity, fetal, prematurity, and, low, birth, there, is, also, a, potential, positive, impact, on, the, individual, s, social, and, economic, advancement, as, raising, a, child, requires, significant, amounts, of, resources, time, social, financial, and, environmental, planning, can, help, assure, that, resources, are, available, for, many, the, purpose, of, family, planning, is, to, make, sure, that, any, couple, man, or, woman, who, has, a, child, has, the, resources, that, are, needed, in, order, to, complete, this, goal, with, these, resources, a, couple, man, or, woman, can, explore, the, options, of, natural, birth, surrogacy, artificial, insemination, or, adoption, in, the, other, case, if, the, person, does, not, wish, to, have, a, child, at, the, specific, time, they, can, investigate, the, resources, that, are, needed, to, prevent, pregnancy, such, as, birth, control, contraceptives, or, physical, protection, and, prevention, there, is, no, clear, social, impact, case, for, or, against, conceiving, a, child, individually, for, most, people, bearing, a, child, or, not, has, no, measurable, impact, on, personal, well, being, a, review, of, the, economic, literature, on, life, satisfaction, shows, that, certain, groups, of, people, are, much, happier, without, children, however, both, adoptees, and, the, adopters, report, that, they, are, happier, after, adoption, when, women, can, pursue, additional, education, and, paid, employment, families, can, invest, more, in, each, child, children, with, fewer, siblings, tend, to, stay, in, school, longer, than, those, with, many, siblings, leaving, school, in, order, to, have, children, has, long, term, implications, for, the, future, of, these, girls, as, well, as, the, human, capital, of, their, families, and, communities, family, planning, slows, unsustainable, population, growth, which, drains, resources, from, the, environment, and, national, and, regional, development, efforts,

achieve, their, demographic, dividend, which, means, that, countries, productivity, is, able, to, increase, when, there, are, more, people, in, the, workforce, and, less, dependents, unfpa, says, that, for, every, dollar, invested, in, contraception, the, cost, of, pregnancy, related, care, is, reduced, by, 1, 47, unfpa, states, the, lifetime, opportunity, cost, related, to, adolescent,

transferred, into, the, uterus, the, woman, who, carries, the, child, is, often, referred, to, as, a, gestational, carrier, the, legal, steps, to, confirm, parentage, with, the, intended, parents, are, generally, easier, than, in, a, traditional, because, there, is, no, genetic, connection, between, child, and, carrier, sperm, donation, is, another, form, of, assisted, conception, it, involves,

proportional, to, the, number, of, humans, family, planning, has, a, significant, impact, on, climate, change, the, research, project, drawdown, estimates, that, family, planning, is, the, seventh, most, efficient, action, against, climate, change, ahead, of, solar, farms, nuclear, power, afforestation, and, many, other, actions, in, a, 2021, paper, for, sustainability, science, william, j, ripple, christopher, wolf, and, eileen, crist, argue, that, population, policies, can, both, advance, social, justice, while, at, the, same, time, mitigating, the, human, impact, on, the, climate, and, the, earth, system, they, note, that, the, richer, half, of, the, world, s, population, is, responsible, for, 90, of, the, co, 2, emissions, having, children, produces, a, quality, quantity, trade, off, parents, need, to, decide, how, many, children, to, have, and, how, much, to, invest, in, the, future, of, each, child, the, increasing, marginal, cost, of, quality, child, outcome, with, respect, to, quantity, number, of, children, creates, a, trade, off, between, quantity, and, quality, the, quantity, quality, trade, off, means, that, policies, that, raise, benefits, of, investing, in, child, quality, will, generate, higher, levels, of, human, capital, and, policies, that, lower, the, costs, of, having, children, may, have, unintended, adverse, consequences, on, long, run, economic, growth, when, deciding, how, many, children, parents, are, influenced, by, their, income, level, perceived, return, to, human, capital, investment, and, cultural, norms, related, to, gender, equality, controlling, birth, rates, allows, families, to, raise, the, future, earnings, power, of, the, next, generation, many, empirical, studies, have, tested, the, quantity, quality, trade, off, and, either, observed, a, negative, correlation, between, family, size, and, child, quality, or, did, not, find, a, correlation, most, studies, treat, family, size, as, an, exogenous, variable, because, parents, choose, childbearing, and, child, outcome, and, therefore, cannot, establish, causality, they, are, both, influenced, by, typically, non, observable, parental, preferences, and, household, characteristics, but, some, studies, observe, proxy, variables, such, as, investment, in, education, high, fertility, countries, have, 18, of, the, world, s, population, but, contribute, 38, of, the, population, growth, in, order, to, become, rich, resources, must, be, re, appropriated, to, increase, income, per, person, rather, than, supporting, larger, populations, as, populations, increase, governments, must, accommodate, increasing, investments, in, health, and, human, capital, and, institutional, reforms, to, address, demographic, divides, reducing, the, cost, of, human, capital, can, be, implemented, by, subsidizing, education, which, raises, the, earning, power, of, women, and, the, opportunity, cost, of, having, children, consequently, lowering, fertility, access, to, contraceptives, may, also, yield, lower, fertility, rates, having, more, children, than, expected, constrains, the, individual, from, attaining, their, desired, level, of, investment, in, child, quantity, and, quality, in, high, fertility, contexts, reduced, fertility, may, contribute, to, economic, development, by, improving, child, outcomes, reducing, maternal, mortality, and, increasing, female, human, capital, dang, and, rogers, 2015, show, that, in, vietnam, family, planning, services, increased, investment, in, education, by, lowering, the, relative, cost, of, child, quality, and, encouraging, families, to, invest, in, quality, by, observing, the, distance, to, the, nearest, family, planning, center, and, the, general, education, expenditure, on, each, child, dang, and, rogers, provide, evidence, that, parents, in, vietnam, are, making, a, child, quality, quantity, trade, off, currently, developed, countries, have, experienced, rising, economic, growth, and, falling, fertility, as, a, result, of, the, demographic, transition, that, takes, place, when, countries, become, rich, developed, countries, have, an, increasing, proportion, of, retired, people, which, raises, the, burden, on, the, workforce, population, to, support, pensions, and, social, programs, encouraging, higher, fertility, as, a, solution, may, risk, reversing, the, benefits, for, increased, child, investment, and, female, labor, force, participation, have, had, on, economic, growth, increasing, high, skill, migration, may, be, an, effective, way, to, increase, the, return, to, education, leading, to, lower, fertility, and, a, greater, supply, of, highly, skilled, individuals, 214, million, women, of, reproductive, age, in, developing, countries, who, do, not, want, to, become, pregnant, are, not, using, a, modern, contraceptive, method, this, could, be, a, result, of, a, limited, choice, of, methods, limited, access, to, contraception, fear, of, side, effects, cultural, or, religious, opposition, poor, quality, of, available, services, user, or, provider, bias, or, gender, based, barriers, in, africa, 24, 2, of, women, of, reproductive, age, do, not, have, access, to, modern, contraction, in, asia, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, the, unmet, need, is, 10, 11, meeting, the, unmet, need, for, contraception, could, prevent, 104, 000, maternal, deaths, per, year, a, 29, reduction, of, women, dying, from, postpartum, hemorrhage, or, unsafe, abortions, according, to, the, united, nations, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, population, division, 64, of, the, world, uses, contraceptives, and, 12, of, the, world, population, s, need, for, contraceptives, is, unmet, in, the, least, developed, countries, 22, of, the, population, do, not, have, access, to, contraceptives, and, 40, use, contraceptives, the, unmet, need, for, modern, contraceptives, is, very, high, in, sub, saharan, africa, south, asia, and, western, asia, africa, has, the, lowest, rate, of, contraceptive, use, 33, and, highest, rate, of, unmet, need, 22, northern, america, has, the, highest, rate, of, contraceptive, use, 73, and, the, lowest, unmet, need, 7, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, follows, closely, behind, with, 73, contraceptive, use, and, 11, unmet, need, europe, and, asia, are, on, par, europe, has, a, 69, contraceptive, use, rate, and, 10, unmet, need, asia, has, a, 68, contraceptive, use, and, 10, unmet, need, although, unmet, need, is, lower, in, asia, because, of, the, large, population, in, this, region, the, number, of, women, with, unmet, need, is, 443, million, compared, to, 74, million, in, europe, oceania, has, a, 59, contraceptive, use, rate, and, 15, unmet, need, when, comparing, the, regions, within, these, continents, eastern, asia, ranks, the, highest, rate, of, contraceptive, use, 82, and, lowest, unmet, need, 5, western, africa, ranks, the, lowest, rate, of, contraceptive, use, 17, middle, africa, ranks, the, highest, unmet, need, 26, unmet, need, is, higher, among, poorer, women, in, bolivia, and, ethiopia, unmet, need, is, tripled, and, doubled, among, poor, populations, however, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, liberia, the, rates, of, unmet, need, are, different, by, 1, 2, percentage, points, this, suggests, that, as, wealthier, women, begin, to, want, smaller, families, they, will, increasingly, seek, out, family, planning, methods, substantial, unmet, need, has, provoked, family, planning, programs, by, governments, and, donors, but, the, impact, of, family, planning, programs, on, fertility, and, contraceptive, use, remains, somewhat, unsettled, demand, theory, argues, that, in, traditional, agricultural, societies, fertility, rates, are, driven, by, the, desire, to, offset, high, mortality, thus, as, society, modernizes, the, costs, of, raising, children, increases, reducing, their, economic, value, and, resulting, in, a, decline, in, desired, number, of, children, under, this, theory, family, planning, programs, will, have, a, marginal, impact, bongaarts, 2014, shows, that, using, a, country, case, study, approach, both, stronger, and, weaker, family, programs, reduce, the, unmet, need, for, contraceptives, and, increases, use, by, making, modern, contraceptives, more, widely, available, and, removing, obstacles, to, use, also, the, demand, that, is, satisfied, and, the, proportion, of, women, using, modern, methods, increased, the, programs, may, have, an, additional, effect, of, diffusing, the, ideas, related, to, family, planning, and, thus, raising, the, demand, for, contraception, as, a, result, a, small, decrease, in, unmet, need, may, be, offset, by, a, rise, in, demand, nonetheless, even, in, countries, where, it, is, assumed, that, family, programs, will, make, a, marginal, impact, bongaarts, shows, that, family, planning, programs, can, potentially, increase, contraceptive, use, and, increase, decrease, demand, depending, on, the, preexisting, attitudes, of, the, community, most, of, the, countries, with, lowest, rates, of, contraceptive, use, highest, maternal, infant, and, child, mortality, rates, and, highest, fertility, rates, are, in, africa, only, about, 30, of, all, women, use, birth, control, although, over, half, of, all, african, women, would, like, to, use, birth, control, if, it, was, available, to, them, the, main, problems, that, preventing, access, to, and, use, of, birth, control, are, unavailability, poor, health, care, services, spousal, disapproval, religious, concerns, and, misinformation, about, the, effects, of, birth, control, the, most, available, type, of, birth, control, is, condoms, a, rapidly, growing, population, coupled, with, an, increase, in, preventable, diseases, means, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, face, an, increasingly, younger, population, family, planning, has, been, practiced, since, the, 16th, century, by, the, people, of, djenn, in, west, africa, when, physicians, advised, women, to, space, their, births, at, three, year, intervals, china, s, family, planning, policy, forced, couples, to, have, no, more, than, one, child, beginning, in, 1979, and, being, officially, phased, out, in, 2015, the, policy, was, instated, to, control, the, rapid, population, growth, that, was, occurring, in, the, nation, at, that, time, with, the, rapid, change, in, population, china, was, facing, many, impacts, including, poverty, and, homelessness, as, a, developing, nation, the, chinese, government, was, concerned, that, a, continuation, of, the, rapid, population, growth, that, had, been, occurring, would, hinder, their, development, as, a, nation, the, process, of, family, planning, varied, throughout, china, as, people, differed, in, their, responsiveness, to, the, one, child, policy, based, on, location, and, socioeconomic, status, for, example, many, families, in, the, cities, accepted, the, policy, more, readily, based, on, the, lack, of, space, money, and, resources, that, often, occurs, in, the, cities, another, example, can, be, found, in, the, enforcement, of, this, rule, people, living, in, rural, areas, of, china, were, in, some, cases, permitted, to, have, more, than, one, child, but, had, to, wait, several, years, after, the, birth, of, the, first, one, however, the, people, in, rural, areas, of, china, were, more, hesitant, in, accepting, this, policy, china, s, population, policy, has, been, credited, with, a, very, significant, slowing, of, china, s, population, growth, which, had, been, higher, before, the, policy, was, implemented, however, the, policy, has, come, under, criticism, that, it, has, resulted, in, abuse, of, women, and, girls, often, implementation, of, the, policy, has, involved, forced, abortions, forced, sterilization, and, infanticides, in, areas, where, family, planning, regulations, were, strictly, enforced, like, guangxi, province, 80, of, trafficked, babies, were, girls, as, parents, were, more, likely, to, sell, their, baby, girls, on, the, black, market, than, baby, boys, the, number, of, girls, that, die, within, their, first, year, of, birth, is, twice, that, of, boys, another, drawback, of, the, policy, is, that, china, s, elderly, population, is, now, increasing, rapidly, however, while, the, punishment, of, unplanned, pregnancy, is, a, large, fine, both, forced, abortion, and, forced, sterilization, can, be, charged, with, intentional, assault, which, is, punished, with, up, to, ten, years, imprisonment, family, planning, in, china, had, its, benefits, and, its, drawbacks, for, example, it, helped, reduce, the, population, by, about, 300, million, people, in, its, first, 20, years, a, drawback, is, that, there, are, now, millions, of, sibling, less, people, and, in, china, siblings, are, very, important, once, the, parent, generation, gets, older, the, children, help, take, care, of, them, and, the, work, is, usually, equally, split, among, the, siblings, another, benefit, of, the, implementation, of, the, one, child, law, is, that, it, reduced, the, fertility, rate, from, about, 2, 75, children, born, per, woman, to, about, 1, 8, children, born, per, woman, in, the, 1979, in, 2015, china, ended, the, one, child, policy, announcing, that, all, married, couples, will, be, allowed, to, have, two, children, in, a, bid, to, reverse, the, rapid, aging, of, the, labor, force, the, one, child, policy, was, replaced, with, a, two, child, policy, in, 2020, chinese, academics, warn, the, country, s, leaders, that, the, country, s, history, of, family, planning, have, led, to, a, decline, in, population, growth, the, decline, in, birthrate, along, with, the, increase, in, life, expectancy, could, potentially, mean, that, there, will, be, too, few, workers, to, support, the, large, aging, population, in, 2021, chinese, officials, announced, that, a, chinese, couple, can, now, have, three, children, as, the, two, child, policy, failed, to, increase, the, country, s, declining, birthrate, according, to, an, investigative, report, by, the, associated, press, published, 28, june, 2020, the, chinese, government, is, taking, draconian, measures, to, slash, birth, rates, among, uyghurs, and, other, minorities, as, part, of, a, sweeping, campaign, to, curb, its, muslim, population, even, as, it, encourages, some, of, the, country, s, han, majority, to, have, more, children, while, individual, women, have, spoken, out, before, about, forced, birth, control, the, practice, is, far, more, widespread, and, systematic, than, previously, known, according, to, an, ap, investigation, based, on, government, statistics, state, documents, and, interviews, with, 30, ex, detainees, family, members, and, a, former, detention, camp, instructor, the, ongoing, oppression, of, the, uyghur, people, and, the, violence, against, their, reproductive, rights, started, in, 2017, in, the, far, west, region, of, xinjiang, and, is, leading, to, what, some, experts, are, calling, a, form, of, demographic, genocide, in, 2021, the, uyghur, tribunal, in, london, concluded, that, china, has, subjected, the, muslim, minority, to, forced, sterilizations, and, abortion, approved, by, the, highest, level, in, beijing, through, their, investigation, they, also, found, evidence, that, pregnant, women, were, forced, to, have, abortions, even, at, the, last, stage, of, pregnancy, since, 2017, births, in, china, s, xinjiang, regions, have, dropped, sharply, between, 2015, and, 2018, population, growth, in, largely, uyghur, areas, fell, by, 84, this, decline, is, not, only, attributed, to, the, splitting, of, couples, but, also, mass, sterilization, policies, and, forced, iud, implantation, between, 2014, and, 2018, the, rate, of, iud, placements, increased, by, more, than, 60, in, xinjiang, while, it, dropped, in, other, areas, of, china, uyghur, survivors, who, have, made, it, out, of, the, concentration, camps, have, reported, and, testified, regarding, the, violence, against, reproductive, rights, in, the, camps, one, survivor, shares, that, she, was, given, injections, and, kicked, repeatedly, in, the, stomach, and, is, no, longer, able, to, have, children, this, is, one, of, countless, examples, of, the, violence, against, women, and, their, rights, to, family, planning, within, the, uyghur, concentration, camps, in, hong, kong, the, eugenics, league, was, founded, in, 1936, which, became, the, family, planning, association, of, hong, kong, in, 1950, the, organisation, provides, family, planning, advice, sex, education, birth, control, services, to, the, general, public, of, hong, kong, in, the, 1970s, due, to, the, rapidly, rising, population, it, launched, the, two, is, enough, campaign, which, reduced, the, general, birth, rate, through, educational, means, the, family, planning, association, of, hong, kong, hong, kong, s, national, family, planning, association, founded, the, international, planned, parenthood, federation, with, its, counterparts, in, seven, other, countries, family, planning, in, india, is, based, on, efforts, largely, sponsored, by, the, indian, government, in, the, 1965, 2009, period, contraceptive, usage, has, more, than, tripled, from, 13, of, married, women, in, 1970, to, 48, in, 2009, and, the, fertility, rate, has, more, than, halved, from, 5, 7, in, 1966, to, 2, 6, in, 2009, but, the, national, fertility, rate, is, still, high, enough, to, cause, long, term, population, growth, india, adds, up, to, 1, 000, 000, people, to, its, population, every, 15, days, however, forecasted, growth, rate, may, be, inaccurate, due, to, high, disparities, in, education, among, indian, females, and, indian, states, an, increase, in, education, rates, has, been, associated, with, a, decline, in, the, national, fertility, rate, of, india, as, of, 2015, the, national, fertility, rate, among, indian, females, is, 2, 2, children, per, female, which, is, approximately, 3, times, less, than, india, s, national, fertility, rate, in, the, 1960s, this, shift, in, national, fertility, rate, may, also, reflect, a, marked, change, in, family, planning, practices, within, india, india, s, ministry, of, health, and, family, welfare, states, that, if, adequate, family, planning, access, resources, become, available, and, accessible, india, would, reduce, the, number, of, infant, deaths, by, 1, 200, 000, some, of, the, most, prevalent, forms, of, contraception, used, in, india, today, include, sterilization, which, is, the, most, common, method, followed, by, use, of, condoms, and, oral, contraceptive, pills, however, the, use, of, intrauterine, devices, iud, s, remains, markedly, lower, there, is, also, a, wide, variation, in, the, demand, for, family, planning, services, and, methods, in, different, indian, states, with, manipur, having, the, lowest, demand, 23, 6, while, andhra, pradesh, has, the, highest, 93, 6, levels, of, social, independence, and, attitudes, towards, domestic, violence, have, been, shown, to, influence, demand, for, family, planning, services, and, resources, however, more, research, is, necessary, to, determine, other, predictive, factors, to, gauge, demand, for, family, planning, economic, and, cultural, barriers, also, impede, the, delivery, of, family, planning, resources, to, all, women, on, a, national, level, a, lack, of, cohesive, infrastructure, in, developing, countries, poses, one, great, hurdle, to, physically, delivering, oral, contraceptives, and, medications, to, woman, residing, in, non, urban, areas, additionally, the, expensiveness, of, modern, contraceptives, limits, women, from, regularly, accessing, these, resources, culturally, the, use, of, contraceptives, is, discouraged, and, antagonized, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, this, sentiment, varies, greatly, among, castes, social, classes, education, status, and, geographic, location, debate, exists, regarding, the, widespread, acceptance, of, family, planning, practices, within, india, some, parties, argue, that, longer, life, expectancy, coupled, with, lower, birth, rates, allow, working, age, individuals, to, accumulate, more, wealth, since, they, need, to, support, fewer, dependents, conversely, other, studies, indicate, that, family, planning, can, reduce, the, birth, rate, and, cause, the, country, s, population, to, shrink, this, debate, has, garnered, national, attention, and, legislation, has, been, passed, and, is, being, considered, in, the, indian, parliament, to, resolve, these, issues, while, iran, s, population, grew, at, a, rate, of, more, than, 3, per, year, between, 1956, and, 1986, the, growth, rate, began, to, decline, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, after, the, government, initiated, a, major, population, control, program, by, 2007, the, growth, rate, had, declined, to, 0, 7, percent, per, year, with, a, birth, rate, of, 17, per, 1, 000, persons, and, a, death, rate, of, 6, per, 1, 000, reports, by, the, un, show, birth, control, policies, in, iran, to, be, effective, with, the, country, topping, the, list, of, greatest, fertility, decreases, un, s, population, division, of, the, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, says, that, between, 1975, and, 1980, the, total, fertility, number, was, 6, 5, the, projected, level, for, iran, s, 2005, to, 2010, birth, rate, is, fewer, than, two, in, late, july, 2012, supreme, leader, ali, khamenei, described, iran, s, contraceptive, services, as, wrong, and, iranian, authorities, are, slashing, birth, control, programs, in, what, one, western, newspaper, usa, today, describes, as, a, major, reversal, of, its, long, standing, policy, whether, program, cuts, and, high, level, appeals, for, bigger, families, will, be, successful, is, still, unclear, the, sale, of, contraceptives, was, illegal, in, ireland, from, 1935, until, 1980, when, it, was, legalized, with, strong, restrictions, later, loosened, it, has, been, argued, that, the, resulting, demographic, dividend, played, a, role, in, the, economic, boom, in, ireland, that, began, in, the, 1990s, and, ended, abruptly, in, 2008, the, celtic, tiger, was, in, part, due, to, the, legalisation, of, contraception, in, 1979, and, subsequent, decline, in, the, fertility, rate, in, ireland, the, ratio, of, workers, to, dependents, increased, due, to, lower, fertility, the, reality, of, which, has, been, questioned, but, was, raised, further, by, increased, female, labor, market, participation, in, agreement, with, the, 1994, international, conference, on, population, and, development, in, cairo, pakistan, pledged, that, by, 2010, it, would, provide,

use, in, 2011, just, one, in, five, pakistani, women, ages, 15, to, 49, uses, modern, birth, control, contraception, is, shunned, under, traditional, social, mores, that, are, fiercely, defended, as,

fertility, control, sexual, education, and, maternal, care, while, there, is, general, agreement, about, its, provisions, on, maternal, and, child, health, there, is, great, debate, on, its, mandate, that, the, philippine, government, and, the, private, sector, will, fund, and, undertake, widespread, distribution, of, family, planning, devices, such, as, condoms, birth, control, pills, and, iuds, as, the, government, continues, to, disseminate, information, on, their, use, through, all, health, care, centers, according, to, a, 2004, study, current, pregnancies, were, termed, desired, and,

with, the, highest, likelihood, of, future, pregnancies, is, oocyte, freezing, and, embryo, freezing, for, individuals, wanting, to, conceive, very, soon, they, will, need, to, use, donor, gametes, the, donor, gametes, can, be, anonymous, or, known, directed, donors, these, donors, must, undergo, a, mandated, food, and, drug, administration, fda, screenings, which, include, questionnaires, physical, examination, and, sexually, transmitted, infection, lesbian, couples, need, donor, sperm, to, conceive, through, several, options, including, therapeutic, donor, insemination, tdi, with, or, without, ovarian, stimulation, autologous, ivf, and, reciprocal, or, co, ivf, reciprocal, or, co, ivf, is, an, option, where, one, partner, undergoes, controlled, ovarian, hyper, stimulation, and, oocyte, retrieval, followed, by, transfer, of, a, fertilized, embryo, into, the, other, s, uterus, co, ivf, is, not, considered, oocyte, donation, because, the, oocyte, is, considered, shared, just,

because, of, the, complex, stressful, process, for, all, parties, involved, overall, transgender, and, gender, diverse, individuals, face, multiple, barriers, to, achieving, family, planning, goals, this, community, experiences, lack, of, access, to, reproductive, health, care, settings, where, they, feel, accepted, safe, and, understood, reproduction, help, pregnancy, care, and, contraception, a, barrier, that, gets, in, the, way, of, becoming, parents, is, the, cost, involved, with, fertility, preservation, options, for, example, the, use, of, sperm, cryopreservation, in, the, united, states, is, less, than, 5, while, countries, such, as, the, netherlands, australia, and, israel, have, higher, rates, this, may, be, the, result, of, challenges, navigating, health, insurance, coverage, according, to, a, study, in, the, united, states, the, national, median, initial, bank, fee, and, annual, price, of, storage, are, 350, and, 385, respectively, for, those, looking, for, egg, preservation, a, study, calculated, that, the, median, total, cost, which, includes, egg, freezing, egg, thawing, and, annual, preservation, fee, in, united, states, was, around, 7, 444, and, the, cumulative, costs, for, one, live, birth, of, us, 11, 704, for, an, individual, in, the, age, groups, 35, years, other, common, concerns, that, arise, when, seeking, pregnancy, include, having, to, stop, or, delay, of, hormonal, therapy, worsening, of, gender, dysphoria, with, treatment, related, to, pregnancy, interventions, used, to, facilitate, gender, transition, such, as, hormone, therapy, and, gender, affirming, surgeries, e, g, genital, surgery, and, chest, surgery, can, temporarily, or, permanently, impact, the, chance, of, becoming, pregnant, the, world, professional, organization, for, transgender, health, wpath, and, american, society, for, reproductive, medicine, asrma, recommend, offering, counseling, on, the, impact, on, family, planning, and, transitioning, to, all, transgender, individuals, even, though, many, transgender, and, gender, nonbinary, youth, express, desire, to, receive, fertility, counseling, and, recommendations, from, professional, organization, studies, indicate, that, only, a, small, portion, have, these, conversations, with, their, health, care, team, health, care, professionals, attribute, lack, of, knowledge, of, reproductive, health, in, this, community, knowledge, limitation, due, to, lack, of, data, on, long, term, effects, of, hormonal, intervention, to, the, inconsistency, in, discussion, around, family, building, studies, have, shown, that, transgender, men, can, still, become, pregnant, even, in, the, absence, of, menstruation, caused, by, gendered, affirming, therapy, in, the, form, of, testosterone, inconsistent, hormonal, therapy, such, as, missed, doses, incomplete, dosing, or, switching, therapy, regimen, mostly, due, to, barriers, noted, earlier, may, also, lead, to, breakthrough, ovulation, which, can, contribute, to, increase, chances, of, unintended, pregnant, highlighting, the, need, of, contraception, on, transgender, men, who, have, conserved, reproductive, organs, on, testosterone, if, pregnancy, is, not, desired, furthermore, testosterone, can, cause, abnormal, vaginal, development, in, female, fetuses, especially, in, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, becoming, a, concern, for, transgender, men, who, conceived, while, on, hormone, therapy, moreover, condoms, are, one, of, the, most, common, contraceptive, methods, in, transgender, men, while, another, subset, report, no, contraception, use, which, can, lead, to, unintended, pregnancies, some, challenges, to, adopting, a, form, of, family, planning, method, among, this, population, varies, depending, on, the, method, for, instance, fear, of, prevention, of, masculinization, with, use, of, estrogen, based, contraceptives, and, gender, dysphoria, with, the, use, of, contraceptive, devises, inside, cervical, pelvic, cavity, additionally, negative, experiences, in, the, health, care, system, related, to, gender, identity, and, denial, of, health, care, based, on, gender, identity, makes, it, difficult, for, this, community, to, access, health, care, and, family, planning, resources, there, are, many, reasons, as, to, why, women, do, not, use, contraceptives, these, reasons, include, logistical, problems, scientific, and, religious, concerns, limited, access, to, transportation, in, order, to, access, health, clinics, lack, of, education, and, knowledge, and, opposition, by, partners, families, or, communities, the, unfpa, states, poorer, women, and, those, in, rural, areas, often, have, less, access, to, family, planning, services, certain, groups, including, adolescents, unmarried, people, the, urban, poor, rural, populations, sex, workers, and, people, living, with, hiv, also, face, a, variety, of, barriers, to, family, planning, this, can, lead, to, higher, rates, of, unintended, pregnancy, increased, risk, of, hiv, and, other, stis, limited, choice, of, contraceptive, methods, and, higher, levels, of, unmet, need, for, family, planning, for, national, international, or, local, health, programs, involved, in, family, planning, the, use, of, standard, indicators, is, increasingly, encouraged, to, track, barriers, to, effective, family, planning, along, with, the, efficacy, uptake, and, provision, of, family, planning, services, family, planning, has, reduced, the, burden, of, childbearing, from, women, now, having, to, raise, fewer, children, than, before, women, are, no, longer, as, economically, dependant, on, their, partners, as, such, they, are, not, necessitated, to, stay, in, marriages, due, to, the, confidence, that, they, can, raise, children, with, less, financial, difficulty, that, if, they, had, several, children, in, order, to, preserve, traditional, gender, roles, social, conservatives, seek, to, reverse, the, social, changes, brought, by, family, planning, and, declining, birth, rate, they, are, opposed, to, most, forms, of, family, planning, and, advocate, for, larger, families, with, many, children, to, this, end, they, sometimes, cite, the, decline, of, religion, or, the, family, but, as, hans, rosling, notes, in, his, book, factfulness, this, has, little, to, do, with, religious, or, family, values, and, are, merely, patriarchal, values, as, of, march, 2020, there, were, an, estimated, 450, million, women, using, modern, contraceptives, across, 114, priority, low, and, middle, income, countries, the, covid, 19, pandemic, as, well, as, social, distancing, and, other, strategies, to, reduce, transmission, are, anticipated, to, impact, the, ability, of, these, women, to, continue, using, contraception, the, number, of, unintended, pregnancies, will, increase, as, the, lockdown, continues, and, services, disruptions, are, extended, some, 47, million, women, in, 114, low, and, middle, income, countries, are, projected, to, be, unable, to, use, modern, contraceptives, if, the, average, lockdown, or, covid, 19, related, disruption, continues, for, six, months, with, major, disruptions, to, services, for, every, three, months, the, lockdown, continues, assuming, high, levels, of, disruption, up, to, 2, million, additional, women, may, be, unable, to, use, modern, contraceptives, if, the, lockdown, continues, for, six, months, and, there, are, major, service, disruptions, due, to, covid, 19, an, additional, 7, million, unintended, pregnancies, are, expected, to, occur, september, 26, is, designated, as, world, contraception, day, devoted, to, raising, awareness, of, contraception, and, improving, education, about, sexual, and, reproductive, health, with,

need, for, abortion, especially, unsafe, abortion, the, campaign, to, conflate, contraception, and, abortion, is, rooted, on, the, assertion, that, contraception, ends, rather, than, prevents, pregnancy, this, is, due, to, the, notion, that, preventing, implantation, implies, an, abortion, when, considering, fertilization, as, the, initial, moment, of, pregnancy, according, to, an, amicus, brief, submitted, to, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, october, 2013, led, by, physicians, for, reproductive, health, and, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, a,
