seafood, is, the, culinary, name, for, food, that, comes, from, any, form, of, sea, life, prominently, including, fish, and, shellfish, shellfish, include, various, species, of, molluscs, e, g, bivalve, molluscs, such, as, clams, oysters, and, mussels, the, harvesting, processing, and, consuming, of, seafoods, are, ancient, practices, with, archaeological, evidence, dating, back, well, into, the, paleolithic, findings, in, a, sea, cave, at, pinnacle, point, in, south, africa, indicate, homo, sapiens, modern, humans, harvested, marine, life, as, early, as, 165, 000, years, ago, while, the, neanderthals, an, extinct, human, species, contemporary, with, early, homo, sapiens, appear, to, have, been, eating, seafood, at, sites, along, the, mediterranean, coast, beginning, around, the, same, time, isotopic, analysis, of, the, skeletal, remains, of, tianyuan, man, a, 40, 000, year, old, anatomically, modern, human, from, eastern, asia, has, shown, that, he, regularly, consumed, freshwater, fish, archaeology, features, such, as, shell, middens, discarded, fish, bones, and, cave, paintings, show, that, sea, foods, were, important, for, survival, and, consumed, in, significant, quantities, during, this, period, most, people, lived, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, and, were, of, necessity, constantly, on, the, move, however, early, examples, of, permanent, settlements, though, not, necessarily, permanently, occupied, such, as, those, at, lepenski, vir, were, almost, always, associated, with, fishing, as, a, major, source, of, food, the, ancient, river, nile, was, full, of, fish, fresh, and, dried, fish, were, a, staple, food, for, much, of, the, population, the, egyptians, had, implements, and, methods, for, fishing, and, these, are, illustrated, in, tomb, scenes, drawings, and, papyrus, documents, some, representations, hint, at, fishing, being, pursued, as, a, pastime, fishing, scenes, are, rarely, represented, in, ancient, greek, culture, a, reflection, of, the, low, social, status, of, fishing, however, oppian, of, corycus, a, greek, author, wrote, a, major, treatise, on, sea, fishing, the, halieulica, or, halieutika, composed, between, 177, and, 180, this, is, the, earliest, such, work, to, have, survived, to, the, modern, day, the, consumption, of, fish, varied, by, the, wealth, and, location, of, the, household, in, the, greek, islands, and, on, the, coast, fresh, fish, and, seafood, squid, octopus, and, shellfish, were, common, they, were, eaten, locally, but, more, often, transported, inland, sardines, and, anchovies, were, regular, fare, for, the, citizens, of, athens, they, were, sometimes, sold, fresh, but, more, frequently, salted, a, stele, of, the, late, 3rd, century, bce, from, the, small, boeotian, city, of, akraiphia, on, lake, copais, provides, us, with, a, list, of, fish, prices, the, cheapest, was, skaren, probably, parrotfish, whereas, atlantic, bluefin, tuna, was, three, times, as, expensive, common, salt, water, fish, were, yellowfin, tuna, red, mullet, ray, swordfish, or, sturgeon, a, delicacy, that, was, eaten, salted, lake, copais, itself, was, famous, in, all, of, greece, for, its, eels, celebrated, by, the, hero, of, the, acharnians, other, freshwater, fish, were, pike, fish, carp, and, the, less, appreciated, catfish, pictorial, evidence, of, roman, fishing, comes, from, mosaics, at, a, certain, time, the, goatfish, was, considered, the, epitome, of, luxury, above, all, because, its, scales, exhibit, a, bright, red, colour, when, it, dies, out, of, water, for, this, reason, these, fish, were, occasionally, allowed, to, die, slowly, at, the, table, there, even, was, a, recipe, where, this, would, take, place, in, garo, in, the, sauce, at, the, beginning, of, the, imperial, era, however, this, custom, suddenly, came, to, an, end, which, is, why, m, ullus, in, the, feast, of, trimalchio, see, the, satyricon, could, be, shown, as, a, characteristic, of, the, parvenu, who, bores, his, guests, with, an, unfashionable, display, of, dying, fish, in, medieval, times, seafood, was, less, prestigious, than, other, animal, meats, and, was, often, seen, as, merely, an, alternative, to, meat, on, fast, days, still, seafood, was, the, mainstay, of, many, coastal, populations, kippers, made, from, herring, caught, in, the, north, sea, could, be, found, in, markets, as, far, away, as, constantinople, while, large, quantities, of, fish, were, eaten, fresh, a, large, proportion, was, salted, dried, and, to, a, lesser, extent, smoked, stockfish, cod, that, was, split, down, the, middle, fixed, to, a, pole, and, dried, was, very, common, though, preparation, could, be, time, consuming, and, meant, beating, the, dried, fish, with, a, mallet, before, soaking, it, in, water, a, wide, range, of, mollusks, including, oysters, mussels, and, scallops, were, eaten, by, coastal, and, river, dwelling, populations, and, freshwater, crayfish, were, seen, as, a, desirable, alternative, to, meat, during, fish, days, compared, to, meat, fish, was, much, more, expensive, for, inland, populations, especially, in, central, europe, and, therefore, not, an, option, for, most, modern, knowledge, of, the, reproductive, cycles, of, aquatic, species, has, led, to, the, development, of, hatcheries, and, improved, techniques, of, fish, farming, and, aquaculture, a, better, understanding, of, the, hazards, of, eating, raw, and, undercooked, fish, and, shellfish, has, led, to, improved, preservation, methods, and, processing, the, following, table, is, based, on, the, isscaap, classification, international, standard, statistical, classification, of, aquatic, animals, and, plants, used, by, the, fao, to, collect, and, compile, fishery, statistics, the, production, figures, have, been, extracted, from, the, fao, fishstat, database, and, include, both, capture, from, wild, fisheries, and, aquaculture, production, fish, is, a, highly, perishable, product, the, fishy, smell, of, dead, fish, is, due, to, the, breakdown, of, amino, acids, into, biogenic, amines, and, ammonia, live, food, fish, are, often, transported, in, tanks, at, high, expense, for, an, international, market, that, prefers, its, seafood, killed, immediately, before, it, is, cooked, delivery, of, live, fish, without, water, is, also, being, explored, while, some, seafood, restaurants, keep, live, fish, in, aquaria, for, display, purposes, or, cultural, beliefs, the, majority, of, live, fish, are, kept, for, dining, customers, the, live, food, fish, trade, in, hong, kong, for, example, is, estimated, to, have, driven, imports, of, live, food, fish, to, more, than, 15, 000, tonnes, in, 2000, worldwide, sales, that, year, were, estimated, at, us, 400, million, according, to, the, world, resources, institute, if, the, cool, chain, has, not, been, adhered, to, correctly, food, products, generally, decay, and, become, harmful, before, the, validity, date, printed, on, the, package, as, the, potential, harm, for, a, consumer, when, eating, rotten, fish, is, much, larger, than, for, example, with, dairy, products, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, has, introduced, regulation, in, the, usa, requiring, the, use, of, a, time, temperature, indicator, on, certain, fresh, chilled, seafood, products, because, fresh, fish, is, highly, perishable, it, must, be, eaten, promptly, or, discarded, it, can, be, kept, for, only, a, short, time, in, many, countries, fresh, fish, are, filleted, and, displayed, for, sale, on, a, bed, of, crushed, ice, or, refrigerated, fresh, fish, is, most, commonly, found, near, bodies, of, water, but, the, advent, of, refrigerated, train, and, truck, transportation, has, made, fresh, fish, more, widely, available, inland, long, term, preservation, of, fish, is, accomplished, in, a, variety, of, ways, the, oldest, and, still, most, widely, used, techniques, are, drying, and, salting, desiccation, complete, drying, is, commonly, used, to, preserve, fish, such, as, cod, partial, drying, and, salting, are, popular, for, the, preservation, of, fish, like, herring, and, mackerel, fish, such, as, salmon, tuna, and, herring, are, cooked, and, canned, most, fish, are, filleted, before, canning, but, some, small, fish, e, g, sardines, are, only, decapitated, and, gutted, before, canning, seafood, is, consumed, all, over, the, world, it, provides, the, world, s, prime, source, of, high, quality, protein, 14, 16, of, the, animal, protein, consumed, worldwide, over, one, billion, people, rely, on, seafood, as, their, primary, source, of, animal, protein, fish, is, among, the, most, common, food, allergens, since, 1960, annual, global, seafood, consumption, has, more, than, doubled, to, over, 20, kg, per, capita, among, the, top, consumers, are, korea, 78, 5, kg, per, head, norway, 66, 6, kg, and, portugal, 61, 5, kg, the, uk, food, standards, agency, recommends, that, at, least, two, portions, of, seafood, should, be, consumed, each, week, one, of, which, should, be, oil, rich, there, are, over, 100, different, types, of, seafood, available, around, the, coast, of, the, uk, oil, rich, fish, such, as, mackerel, or, herring, are, rich, in, long, chain, omega, 3, oils, these, oils, are, found, in, every, cell, of, the, human, body, and, are, required, for, human, biological, functions, such, as, brain, functionality, whitefish, such, as, haddock, and, cod, are, very, low, in, fat, and, calories, which, combined, with, oily, fish, rich, in, omega, 3, such, as, mackerel, sardines, fresh, tuna, salmon, and, trout, can, help, to, protect, against, coronary, heart, disease, as, well, as, helping, to, develop, strong, bones, and, teeth, shellfish, are, particularly, rich, in, zinc, which, is, essential, for, healthy, skin, and, muscles, as, well, as, fertility, casanova, reputedly, ate, 50, oysters, a, day, over, 33, 000, species, of, fish, and, many, more, marine, invertebrate, species, have, been, identified, bromophenols, which, are, produced, by, marine, algae, give, marine, animals, an, odor, and, taste, that, is, absent, from, freshwater, fish, and, invertebrates, also, a, chemical, substance, called, dimethylsulfoniopropionate, dmsp, that, is, found, in, red, and, green, algae, is, transferred, into, animals, in, the, marine, food, chain, when, broken, down, dimethyl, sulfide, dms, is, produced, and, is, often, released, during, food, preparation, when, fresh, fish, and, shellfish, are, heated, in, small, quantities, it, creates, a, specific, smell, one, associates, with, the, ocean, but, in, larger, quantities, gives, the, impression, of, rotten, seaweed, and, old, fish, another, molecule, known, as, tmao, occurs, in, fishes, and, gives, them, a, distinct, smell, it, also, exists, in, freshwater, species, but, becomes, more, numerous, in, the, cells, of, an, animal, the, deeper, it, lives, so, fish, from, the, deeper, parts, of, the, ocean, have, a, stronger, taste, than, species, that, live, in, shallow, water, eggs, from, seaweed, contain, sex, pheromones, called, dictyopterenes, which, are, meant, to, attract, the, sperm, these, pheromones, are, also, found, in, edible, seaweeds, which, contributes, to, their, aroma, there, is, broad, scientific, consensus, that, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, and, eicosapentaenoic, acid, epa, found, in, seafood, are, beneficial, to, neurodevelopment, and, cognition, especially, at, young, ages, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, has, described, fish, as, nature, s, super, food, seafood, consumption, is, associated, with, improved, neurologic, development, during, pregnancy, and, early, childhood, and, is, more, tenuously, linked, to, reduced, mortality, from, coronary, heart, disease, fish, consumption, has, been, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, of, dementia, lung, cancer, and, stroke, a, 2020, umbrella, review, concluded, that, fish, consumption, reduces, all, cause, mortality, cancer, cardiovascular, disease, stroke, and, other, outcomes, the, review, suggested, that, two, to, four, servings, per, week, is, generally, safe, however, two, other, recent, umbrella, reviews, have, found, no, statistically, significant, associations, between, fish, consumption, and, cancer, risks, and, have, cautioned, researchers, when, it, comes, to, interpreting, reported, associations, between, fish, consumption, and, cancer, risks, because, the, quality, of, evidence, is, very, low, the, parts, of, fish, containing, essential, fats, and, micronutrients, often, cited, as, primary, health, benefits, of, eating, seafood, are, frequently, discarded, in, the, developed, world, micronutrients, including, calcium, potassium, selenium, zinc, and, iodine, are, found, in, their, highest, concentrations, in, the, head, intestines, bones, and, scales, government, recommendations, promote, moderate, consumption, of, fish, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, recommends, moderate, 4, oz, for, children, and, 8, 12, oz, for, adults, weekly, consumption, of, fish, as, part, of, a, healthy, and, balanced, diet, the, uk, national, health, service, gives, similar, advice, recommending, at, least, 2, portions, about, 10, oz, of, fish, weekly, the, chinese, national, health, commission, recommends, slightly, more, advising, 10, 20, oz, of, fish, weekly, there, are, numerous, factors, to, consider, when, evaluating, health, hazards, in, seafood, these, concerns, include, marine, toxins, microbes, foodborne, illness, radionuclide, contamination, and, man, made, pollutants, shellfish, are, among, the, more, common, food, allergens, most, of, these, dangers, can, be, mitigated, or, avoided, with, accurate, knowledge, of, when, and, where, seafood, is, caught, however, consumers, have, limited, access, to, relevant, and, actionable, information, in, this, regard, and, the, seafood, industry, s, systemic, problems, with, mislabelling, make, decisions, about, what, is, safe, even, more, fraught, ciguatera, fish, poisoning, cfp, is, an, illness, resulting, from, consuming, toxins, produced, by, dinoflagellates, which, bioaccumulate, in, the, liver, roe, head, and, intestines, of, reef, fish, it, is, the, most, common, disease, associated, with, seafood, consumption, and, poses, the, greatest, risk, to, consumers, the, population, of, plankton, that, produces, these, toxins, varies, significantly, over, time, and, location, as, seen, in, red, tides, evaluating, the, risk, of, ciguatera, in, any, given, fish, requires, specific, knowledge, of, its, origin, and, life, history, information, that, is, often, inaccurate, or, unavailable, while, ciguatera, is, relatively, widespread, compared, to, other, seafood, related, health, hazards, up, to, 50, 000, people, suffer, from, ciguatera, every, year, mortality, is, very, low, scombroid, food, poisoning, is, also, a, seafood, illness, it, is, typically, caused, by, eating, fish, high, in, histamine, from, being, stored, or, processed, improperly, fish, and, shellfish, have, a, natural, tendency, to, concentrate, inorganic, and, organic, toxins, and, pollutants, in, their, bodies, including, methylmercury, a, highly, toxic, organic, compound, of, mercury, polychlorinated, biphenyls, pcbs, and, microplastics, species, of, fish, that, are, high, on, the, food, chain, such, as, shark, swordfish, king, mackerel, albacore, tuna, and, tilefish, contain, higher, concentrations, of, these, bioaccumulates, this, is, because, bioaccumulates, are, stored, in, the, muscle, tissues, of, fish, and, when, a, predatory, fish, eats, another, fish, it, assumes, the, entire, body, burden, of, bioaccumulates, in, the, consumed, fish, thus, species, that, are, high, on, the, food, chain, amass, body, burdens, of, bioaccumulates, that, can, be, ten, times, higher, than, the, species, they, consume, this, process, is, called, biomagnification, man, made, disasters, can, cause, localized, hazards, in, seafood, which, may, spread, widely, via, piscine, food, chains, the, first, occurrence, of, widespread, mercury, poisoning, in, humans, occurred, this, way, in, the, 1950s, in, minamata, japan, wastewater, from, a, nearby, chemical, factory, released, methylmercury, that, accumulated, in, fish, which, were, consumed, by, humans, severe, mercury, poisoning, is, now, known, as, minamata, disease, the, 2011, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, power, plant, disaster, and, 1947, 1991, marshall, islands, nuclear, bomb, testing, led, to, dangerous, radionuclide, contamination, of, local, sea, life, which, in, the, latter, case, remained, as, of, 2008, a, widely, cited, study, in, jama, which, synthesized, government, and, medline, reports, and, meta, analyses, to, evaluate, risks, from, methylmercury, dioxins, and, polychlorinated, biphenyls, to, cardiovascular, health, and, links, between, fish, consumption, and, neurologic, outcomes, concluded, that, the, benefits, of, modest, fish, consumption, 1, 2, servings, wk, outweigh, the, risks, among, adults, and, excepting, a, few, selected, fish, species, among, women, of, childbearing, age, avoidance, of, modest, fish, consumption, due, to, confusion, regarding, risks, and, benefits, could, result, in, thousands, of, excess, chd, deaths, annually, and, suboptimal, neurodevelopment, in, children, due, to, the, wide, array, of, options, in, the, seafood, marketplace, seafood, is, far, more, susceptible, to, mislabeling, than, terrestrial, food, there, are, more, than, 1, 700, species, of, seafood, in, the, united, states, consumer, marketplace, 80, 90, of, which, are, imported, and, less, than, 1, of, which, are, tested, for, fraud, however, more, recent, research, into, seafood, imports, and, consumption, patterns, among, consumers, in, the, united, states, suggests, that, 35, 38, of, seafood, products, are, of, domestic, origin, consumption, suggests, estimates, of, mislabelled, seafood, in, the, united, states, range, from, 33, in, general, up, to, 86, for, particular, species, byzantine, supply, chains, frequent, bycatch, brand, naming, species, substitution, and, inaccurate, ecolabels, all, contribute, to, confusion, for, the, consumer, a, 2013, study, by, oceana, found, that, one, third, of, seafood, sampled, from, the, united, states, was, incorrectly, labeled, snapper, and, tuna, were, particularly, susceptible, to, mislabelling, and, seafood, substitution, was, the, most, common, type, of, fraud, another, type, of, mislabelling, is, short, weighting, where, practices, such, as, overglasing, or, soaking, can, misleadingly, increase, the, apparent, weight, of, the, fish, for, supermarket, shoppers, many, seafood, products, are, unrecognisable, fillets, without, sophisticated, dna, testing, there, is, no, foolproof, method, to, identify, a, fish, species, without, their, head, skin, and, fins, this, creates, easy, opportunities, to, substitute, cheap, products, for, expensive, ones, a, form, of, economic, fraud, beyond, financial, concerns, significant, health, risks, arise, from, hidden, pollutants, and, marine, toxins, in, an, already, fraught, marketplace, seafood, fraud, has, led, to, widespread, keriorrhea, due, to, mislabeled, escolar, mercury, poisoning, from, products, marketed, as, safe, for, pregnant, women, and, hospitalisation, and, neurological, damage, due, to, mislabeled, pufferfish, for, example, a, 2014, study, published, in, plos, one, found, that, 15, of, msc, certified, patagonian, toothfish, originated, from, uncertified, and, mercury, polluted, fisheries, these, fishery, stock, substitutions, had, 100, more, mercury, than, their, genuine, counterparts, vastly, exceeding, limits, in, canada, new, zealand, and, australia, research, into, population, trends, of, various, species, of, seafood, is, pointing, to, a, global, collapse, of, seafood, species, by, 2048, such, a, collapse, would, occur, due, to, pollution, and, overfishing, threatening, oceanic, ecosystems, according, to, some, researchers, a, major, international, scientific, study, released, in, november, 2006, in, the, journal, science, found, that, about, one, third, of, all, fishing, stocks, worldwide, have, collapsed, with, a, collapse, being, defined, as, a, decline, to, less, than, 10, of, their, maximum, observed, abundance, and, that, if, current, trends, continue, all, fish, stocks, worldwide, will, collapse, within, fifty, years, in, july, 2009, boris, worm, of, dalhousie, university, the, author, of, the, november, 2006, study, in, science, co, authored, an, update, on, the, state, of, the, world, s, fisheries, with, one, of, the, original, study, s, critics, ray, hilborn, of, the, university, of, washington, at, seattle, the, new, study, found, that, through, good, fisheries, management, techniques, even, depleted, fish, stocks, can, be, revived, and, made, commercially, viable, again, an, analysis, published, in, august, 2020, indicates, that, seafood, could, theoretically, increase, sustainably, by, 36, 74, by, 2050, compared, to, current, yields, and, that, whether, or, not, these, production, potentials, are, realised, sustainably, depends, on, several, factors, such, as, policy, reforms, technological, innovation, and, the, extent, of, future, shifts, in, demand, the, fao, state, of, world, fisheries, and, aquaculture, 2004, report, estimates, that, in, 2003, of, the, main, fish, stocks, or, groups, of, resources, for, which, assessment, information, is, available, approximately, one, quarter, were, overexploited, depleted, or, recovering, from, depletion, 16, 7, and, 1, respectively, and, needed, rebuilding, the, national, fisheries, institute, a, trade, advocacy, group, representing, the, united, states, seafood, industry, disagree, they, claim, that, currently, observed, declines, in, fish, populations, are, due, to, natural, fluctuations, and, that, enhanced, technologies, will, eventually, alleviate, whatever, impact, humanity, is, having, on, oceanic, life, for, the, most, part, islamic, dietary, laws, allow, the, eating, of, seafood, though, the, hanbali, forbid, eels, the, shafi, forbid, frogs, and, crocodiles, and, the, hanafi, forbid, bottom, feeders, such, as, shellfish, and, carp, the, jewish, laws, of, kashrut, forbid, the, eating, of, shellfish, and, eels, in, the, old, testament, the, mosaic, covenant, allowed, the, israelites, to, eat, finfish, but, shellfish, and, eels, were, an, abomination, and, not, allowed, in, the, new, testament, luke, 24, jesus, eating, of, a, fish, and, jesus, telling, his, disciples, where, to, catch, fish, before, cooking, it, for, them, to, eat, pescatarianism, was, widespread, in, the, early, church, among, both, the, clergy, and, laity, in, ancient, and, medieval, times, the, catholic, church, forbade, the, practice, of, eating, meat, eggs, and, dairy, products, during, lent, thomas, aquinas, argued, that, these, afford, greater, pleasure, as, food, and, greater, nourishment, to, the, human, body, so, that, from, their, consumption, there, results, in, a, greater, surplus, available, for, seminal, matter, which, when, abundant, becomes, a, great, incentive, to, lust, in, the, united, states, the, catholic, practice, of, abstaining, from, meat, on, fridays, during, lent, has, popularised, the, friday, fish, fry, and, parishes, often, sponsor, a, fish, fry, during, lent, in,
