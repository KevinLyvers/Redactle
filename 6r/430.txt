formula, one, commonly, known, as, formula, 1, or, f1, is, the, highest, class, of, international, racing, for, open, wheel, single, seater, formula, racing, cars, sanctioned, by, the, f, d, ration, internationale, de, l, automobile, fia, the, fia, formula, one, world, championship, has, been, one, of, the, world, s, premier, forms, of, racing, since, its, inaugural, running, in, 1950, the, word, formula, in, the, name, refers, to, the, set, of, rules, all, participants, cars, must, follow, a, formula, one, season, consists, of, a, series, of, races, known, as, grands, prix, grands, prix, take, place, in, multiple, countries, and, continents, on, either, purpose, built, circuits, or, closed, public, roads, a, point, system, is, used, at, grands, prix, to, determine, two, annual, world, championships, one, for, the, drivers, and, one, for, the, constructors, the, teams, each, driver, must, hold, a, valid, super, licence, the, highest, class, of, racing, licence, the, fia, issues, and, the, races, must, be, held, on, grade, one, tracks, the, highest, grade, rating, the, fia, issues, for, tracks, formula, one, cars, are, the, world, s, fastest, regulated, road, course, racing, cars, owing, to, very, high, cornering, speeds, achieved, by, generating, large, amounts, of, aerodynamic, downforce, much, of, which, is, generated, by, front, and, rear, wings, the, cars, depend, on, electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and, tyres, traction, control, launch, control, and, automatic, shifting, and, other, electronic, driving, aids, were, first, banned, in, 1994, they, were, briefly, reintroduced, in, 2001, and, have, more, recently, been, banned, since, 2004, and, 2008, respectively, with, the, average, annual, cost, of, running, a, team, designing, building, and, maintaining, cars, pay, transport, at, approximately, 220, 000, 000, or, 265, 000, 000, formula, one, s, financial, and, political, battles, are, widely, reported, the, formula, one, group, is, owned, by, liberty, media, which, acquired, it, in, 2017, from, private, equity, firm, cvc, capital, partners, for, 6, 4, billion, 8, billion, formula, one, originated, from, the, world, manufacturers, championship, 1925, 1930, and, european, drivers, championship, 1931, 1939, the, formula, is, a, set, of, rules, that, all, participants, cars, must, follow, formula, one, was, a, formula, agreed, upon, in, 1946, to, officially, become, effective, in, 1947, the, first, grand, prix, in, accordance, with, the, new, regulations, was, the, 1946, turin, grand, prix, anticipating, the, formula, s, official, start, before, world, war, ii, a, number, of, grand, prix, racing, organisations, made, suggestions, for, a, new, championship, to, replace, the, european, championship, but, due, to, the, suspension, of, racing, during, the, conflict, the, new, international, formula, for, cars, did, not, become, formalised, until, 1946, to, become, effective, in, 1947, the, new, world, championship, was, instituted, to, commence, in, 1950, the, first, world, championship, race, the, 1950, british, grand, prix, took, place, at, silverstone, circuit, in, the, united, kingdom, on, 13, may, 1950, giuseppe, farina, competing, for, alfa, romeo, won, the, first, drivers, world, championship, narrowly, defeating, his, teammate, juan, manuel, fangio, fangio, won, the, championship, in, 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and, 1957, this, set, the, record, for, the, most, world, championships, won, by, a, single, driver, a, record, that, stood, for, 46, years, until, michael, schumacher, won, his, sixth, championship, in, 2003, a, constructors, championship, was, added, in, the, 1958, season, stirling, moss, despite, being, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, formula, one, drivers, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, never, won, the, formula, one, championship, between, 1955, and, 1961, moss, finished, second, in, the, championship, four, times, and, third, the, other, three, times, fangio, won, 24, of, the, 52, races, he, entered, still, the, record, for, the, highest, formula, one, winning, percentage, by, an, individual, driver, national, championships, existed, in, south, africa, and, the, uk, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, promoters, held, non, championship, formula, one, events, for, many, years, due, to, the, increasing, cost, of, competition, the, last, of, these, was, held, in, 1983, this, era, featured, teams, managed, by, road, car, manufacturers, such, as, alfa, romeo, ferrari, mercedes, benz, and, maserati, the, first, seasons, featured, prewar, cars, like, alfa, romeo, s, 158, which, were, front, engined, with, narrow, tyres, and, 1, 5, litre, supercharged, or, 4, 5, litre, naturally, aspirated, engines, the, 1952, and, 1953, seasons, were, run, to, formula, two, regulations, for, smaller, less, powerful, cars, due, to, concerns, over, the, dearth, of, formula, one, cars, when, a, new, formula, one, formula, for, engines, limited, to, 2, 5, litres, was, reinstated, for, the, 1954, world, championship, mercedes, benz, introduced, its, w196, which, featured, things, never, seen, on, formula, one, cars, before, such, as, desmodromic, valves, fuel, injection, and, enclosed, streamlined, bodywork, mercedes, drivers, won, the, championship, for, the, next, two, years, before, the, team, withdrew, from, all, motorsport, competitions, due, to, the, 1955, le, mans, disaster, the, first, major, technological, development, in, the, sport, was, bugatti, s, introduction, of, mid, engined, cars, jack, brabham, the, world, champion, in, 1959, 1960, and, 1966, soon, proved, the, mid, engine, s, superiority, over, all, other, engine, positions, by, 1961, all, teams, had, switched, to, mid, engined, cars, the, ferguson, p99, a, four, wheel, drive, design, was, the, last, front, engined, formula, one, car, to, enter, a, world, championship, race, it, entered, the, 1961, british, grand, prix, the, only, front, engined, car, to, compete, that, year, during, 1962, lotus, introduced, a, car, with, an, aluminium, sheet, monocoque, chassis, instead, of, the, traditional, space, frame, design, this, proved, to, be, the, greatest, technological, breakthrough, since, the, introduction, of, mid, engined, cars, in, 1968, sponsorship, was, introduced, to, the, sport, team, gunston, became, the, first, team, to, run, cigarette, sponsorship, on, its, brabham, cars, which, privately, entered, in, orange, brown, and, gold, colours, of, gunston, cigarettes, in, the, 1968, south, african, grand, prix, on, 1, january, 1968, five, months, later, the, first, works, team, lotus, followed, this, example, when, it, entered, its, cars, painted, in, the, red, gold, and, white, colours, of, the, imperial, tobacco, s, gold, leaf, livery, at, the, 1968, spanish, grand, prix, aerodynamic, downforce, slowly, gained, importance, in, car, design, with, the, appearance, of, aerofoils, during, the, 1968, season, in, the, late, 1970s, lotus, introduced, ground, effect, aerodynamics, previously, used, on, jim, hall, s, chaparral, 2j, in, 1970, that, provided, enormous, downforce, and, greatly, increased, cornering, speeds, the, aerodynamic, forces, pressing, the, cars, to, the, track, were, up, to, five, times, the, car, s, weight, as, a, result, extremely, stiff, springs, were, needed, to, maintain, a, constant, ride, height, leaving, the, suspension, virtually, solid, this, meant, that, the, drivers, depended, entirely, on, the, tyres, for, any, small, amount, of, cushioning, of, the, car, and, driver, from, irregularities, of, the, road, surface, beginning, in, the, 1970s, bernie, ecclestone, rearranged, the, management, of, formula, one, s, commercial, rights, he, is, widely, credited, with, transforming, the, sport, into, the, multibillion, dollar, business, it, now, is, when, ecclestone, bought, the, brabham, team, during, 1971, he, gained, a, seat, on, the, formula, one, constructors, association, and, in, 1978, he, became, its, president, previously, the, circuit, owners, controlled, the, income, of, the, teams, and, negotiated, with, each, individually, ecclestone, persuaded, the, teams, to, hunt, as, a, pack, through, foca, he, offered, formula, one, to, circuit, owners, as, a, package, they, could, take, or, leave, in, return, for, the, package, almost, all, that, was, required, was, to, surrender, trackside, advertising, the, formation, of, the, f, d, ration, internationale, du, sport, automobile, fisa, in, 1979, set, off, the, fisa, foca, war, during, which, fisa, and, its, president, jean, marie, balestre, argued, repeatedly, with, foca, over, television, revenues, and, technical, regulations, the, guardian, said, that, ecclestone, and, max, mosley, used, to, wage, a, guerrilla, war, with, a, very, long, term, aim, in, view, foca, threatened, to, establish, a, rival, series, and, boycotted, a, grand, prix, and, fisa, withdrew, its, sanction, from, races, the, result, was, the, 1981, concorde, agreement, which, guaranteed, technical, stability, as, teams, were, to, be, given, reasonable, notice, of, new, regulations, although, fisa, asserted, its, right, to, the, tv, revenues, it, gave, foca, the, administration, of, those, rights, fisa, imposed, a, ban, on, ground, effect, aerodynamics, during, 1983, but, by, then, turbocharged, engines, which, renault, had, pioneered, in, 1977, were, producing, over, 520, kw, 700, bhp, and, were, essential, to, be, competitive, by, 1986, a, bmw, turbocharged, engine, achieved, a, flash, reading, of, 5, 5, bar, 80, psi, pressure, estimated, to, be, over, 970, kw, 1, 300, bhp, in, qualifying, for, the, italian, grand, prix, the, next, year, power, in, race, trim, reached, around, 820, kw, 1, 100, bhp, with, boost, pressure, limited, to, only, 4, 0, bar, these, cars, were, the, most, powerful, open, wheel, circuit, racing, cars, ever, to, reduce, engine, power, output, and, thus, speeds, the, fia, limited, fuel, tank, capacity, in, 1984, and, boost, pressures, in, 1988, before, banning, turbocharged, engines, completely, in, 1989, the, development, of, electronic, driver, aids, began, in, the, 1980s, lotus, began, to, develop, a, system, of, active, suspension, which, first, appeared, during, 1983, on, the, lotus, 92, by, 1987, this, system, had, been, perfected, and, was, driven, to, victory, by, ayrton, senna, in, the, monaco, grand, prix, that, year, in, the, early, 1990s, other, teams, followed, suit, and, semi, automatic, gearboxes, and, traction, control, were, a, natural, progression, the, fia, due, to, complaints, that, technology, was, determining, races, outcomes, more, than, driver, skill, banned, many, such, aids, for, the, 1994, season, this, resulted, in, cars, that, previously, depended, on, electronic, aids, becoming, very, twitchy, and, difficult, to, drive, observers, felt, the, ban, on, driver, aids, was, in, name, only, as, they, proved, difficult, to, police, effectively, the, teams, signed, a, second, concorde, agreement, in, 1992, and, a, third, in, 1997, on, the, track, the, mclaren, and, williams, teams, dominated, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, brabham, was, also, competitive, during, the, early, 1980s, winning, two, drivers, championships, with, nelson, piquet, powered, by, porsche, honda, and, mercedes, benz, mclaren, won, 16, championships, seven, constructors, and, nine, drivers, in, that, period, while, williams, used, engines, from, ford, honda, and, renault, to, also, win, 16, titles, nine, constructors, and, seven, drivers, the, rivalry, between, racers, ayrton, senna, and, alain, prost, became, f1, s, central, focus, during, 1988, and, continued, until, prost, retired, at, the, end, of, 1993, senna, died, at, the, 1994, san, marino, grand, prix, after, crashing, into, a, wall, on, the, exit, of, the, notorious, curve, tamburello, the, fia, worked, to, improve, the, sport, s, safety, standards, since, that, weekend, during, which, roland, ratzenberger, also, died, in, an, accident, during, saturday, qualifying, no, driver, died, of, injuries, sustained, on, the, track, at, the, wheel, of, a, formula, one, car, for, 20, years, until, the, 2014, japanese, grand, prix, where, jules, bianchi, collided, with, a, recovery, vehicle, after, aquaplaning, off, the, circuit, dying, nine, months, later, from, his, injuries, since, 1994, three, track, marshals, have, died, one, at, the, 2000, italian, grand, prix, one, at, the, 2001, australian, grand, prix, and, one, at, the, 2013, canadian, grand, prix, since, senna, s, and, ratzenberger, s, deaths, the, fia, has, used, safety, as, a, reason, to, impose, rule, changes, that, otherwise, under, the, concorde, agreement, would, have, had, to, be, agreed, upon, by, all, the, teams, most, notably, the, changes, introduced, for, 1998, this, so, called, narrow, track, era, resulted, in, cars, with, smaller, rear, tyres, a, narrower, track, overall, and, the, introduction, of, grooved, tyres, to, reduce, mechanical, grip, the, objective, was, to, reduce, cornering, speeds, and, produce, racing, similar, to, rainy, conditions, by, enforcing, a, smaller, contact, patch, between, tyre, and, track, according, to, the, fia, this, was, to, reduce, cornering, speeds, in, the, interest, of, safety, results, were, mixed, as, the, lack, of, mechanical, grip, resulted, in, the, more, ingenious, designers, clawing, back, the, deficit, with, aerodynamic, grip, this, resulted, in, pushing, more, force, onto, the, tyres, through, wings, and, aerodynamic, devices, which, in, turn, resulted, in, less, overtaking, as, these, devices, tended, to, make, the, wake, behind, the, car, turbulent, or, dirty, this, prevented, other, cars, from, following, closely, due, to, their, dependence, on, clean, air, to, make, the, car, stick, to, the, track, the, grooved, tyres, also, had, the, unfortunate, side, effect, of, initially, being, of, a, harder, compound, to, be, able, to, hold, the, grooved, tread, blocks, which, resulted, in, spectacular, accidents, in, times, of, aerodynamic, grip, failure, as, the, harder, compound, could, not, grip, the, track, as, well, drivers, from, mclaren, williams, renault, formerly, benetton, and, ferrari, dubbed, the, big, four, won, every, world, championship, from, 1984, to, 2008, the, teams, won, every, constructors, championship, from, 1979, to, 2008, as, well, as, placing, themselves, as, the, top, four, teams, in, the, constructors, championship, in, every, season, between, 1989, and, 1997, and, winning, every, race, but, one, the, 1996, monaco, grand, prix, between, 1988, and, 1997, due, to, the, technological, advances, of, the, 1990s, the, cost, of, competing, in, formula, one, increased, dramatically, thus, increasing, financial, burdens, this, combined, with, the, dominance, of, four, teams, largely, funded, by, big, car, manufacturers, such, as, mercedes, benz, caused, the, poorer, independent, teams, to, struggle, not, only, to, remain, competitive, but, to, stay, in, business, this, effectively, forced, several, teams, to, withdraw, michael, schumacher, and, ferrari, won, five, consecutive, drivers, championships, 2000, 2004, and, six, consecutive, constructors, championships, 1999, 2004, schumacher, set, many, new, records, including, those, for, grand, prix, wins, 91, since, beaten, by, lewis, hamilton, wins, in, a, season, 13, since, beaten, by, max, verstappen, and, most, drivers, championships, seven, tied, with, lewis, hamilton, as, of, 2021, schumacher, s, championship, streak, ended, on, 25, september, 2005, when, renault, driver, fernando, alonso, became, formula, one, s, youngest, champion, at, that, time, until, lewis, hamilton, in, 2008, and, followed, by, sebastian, vettel, in, 2010, during, 2006, renault, and, alonso, won, both, titles, again, schumacher, retired, at, the, end, of, 2006, after, 16, years, in, formula, one, but, came, out, of, retirement, for, the, 2010, season, racing, for, the, newly, formed, mercedes, works, team, following, the, rebrand, of, brawn, gp, during, this, period, fia, frequently, changed, the, championship, rules, with, the, intention, of, improving, the, on, track, action, and, cutting, costs, team, orders, legal, since, the, championship, started, during, 1950, were, banned, during, 2002, after, several, incidents, in, which, teams, openly, manipulated, race, results, generating, negative, publicity, most, famously, by, ferrari, at, the, 2002, austrian, grand, prix, other, changes, included, the, qualifying, format, the, point, scoring, system, the, technical, regulations, and, rules, specifying, how, long, engines, and, tyres, must, last, a, tyre, war, between, suppliers, michelin, and, bridgestone, saw, lap, times, fall, although, at, the, 2005, united, states, grand, prix, at, indianapolis, seven, out, of, ten, teams, did, not, race, when, their, michelin, tyres, were, deemed, unsafe, for, use, leading, to, bridgestone, becoming, the, sole, tyre, supplier, to, formula, one, for, the, 2007, season, by, default, on, 20, december, 2007, bridgestone, signed, a, contract, that, officially, made, it, the, exclusive, tyre, supplier, for, the, next, three, seasons, during, 2006, max, mosley, outlined, a, green, future, for, formula, one, in, which, efficient, use, of, energy, would, be, an, important, factor, starting, in, 2000, with, ford, s, purchase, of, stewart, grand, prix, to, form, the, jaguar, racing, team, new, manufacturer, owned, teams, entered, formula, one, for, the, first, time, since, alfa, romeo, s, and, renault, s, departures, in, 1985, by, 2006, the, manufacturer, teams, renault, bmw, toyota, honda, and, ferrari, dominated, the, championship, taking, five, of, the, first, six, places, in, the, constructors, championship, the, exception, was, mclaren, which, at, the, time, was, part, owned, by, mercedes, benz, through, the, grand, prix, manufacturers, association, gpma, the, manufacturers, negotiated, a, larger, share, of, formula, one, s, commercial, profit, and, a, greater, say, in, the, running, of, the, sport, in, 2008, and, 2009, honda, bmw, and, toyota, all, withdrew, from, formula, one, racing, within, a, year, blaming, the, economic, recession, this, resulted, in, the, end, of, manufacturer, dominance, of, the, sport, the, honda, f1, team, went, through, a, management, buyout, to, become, brawn, gp, with, ross, brawn, and, nick, fry, running, and, owning, the, majority, of, the, organisation, brawn, gp, laid, off, hundreds, of, employees, but, won, the, year, s, world, championships, bmw, f1, was, bought, out, by, the, original, founder, of, the, team, peter, sauber, the, lotus, f1, team, was, another, formerly, manufacturer, owned, team, that, reverted, to, privateer, ownership, together, with, the, buy, out, of, the, renault, team, by, genii, capital, investors, but, a, link, with, its, previous, owners, still, survived, with, its, car, continuing, to, be, powered, by, a, renault, engine, until, 2014, mclaren, also, announced, that, it, was, to, reacquire, the, shares, in, its, team, from, mercedes, benz, mclaren, s, partnership, with, mercedes, was, reported, to, have, started, to, sour, with, the, mclaren, mercedes, slr, road, car, project, and, tough, f1, championships, which, included, mclaren, being, found, guilty, of, spying, on, ferrari, hence, during, the, 2010, season, mercedes, benz, reentered, the, sport, as, a, manufacturer, after, it, purchased, brawn, gp, and, split, with, mclaren, after, 15, seasons, with, the, team, during, the, 2009, season, formula, one, was, gripped, by, the, fia, fota, dispute, fia, president, max, mosley, proposed, numerous, cost, cutting, measures, for, the, next, season, including, an, optional, budget, cap, for, the, teams, teams, electing, to, take, the, budget, cap, would, be, granted, greater, technical, freedom, adjustable, front, and, rear, wings, and, an, engine, not, subject, to, a, rev, limiter, the, formula, one, teams, association, fota, believed, that, allowing, some, teams, to, have, such, technical, freedom, would, have, created, a, two, tier, championship, and, thus, requested, urgent, talks, with, the, fia, but, talks, broke, down, and, fota, teams, announced, with, the, exception, of, williams, and, force, india, that, they, had, no, choice, but, to, form, a, breakaway, championship, series, on, 24, june, formula, one, s, governing, body, and, the, teams, reached, an, agreement, to, prevent, a, breakaway, series, it, was, agreed, teams, must, cut, spending, to, the, level, of, the, early, 1990s, within, two, years, exact, figures, were, not, specified, and, max, mosley, agreed, he, would, not, stand, for, reelection, to, the, fia, presidency, in, october, following, further, disagreements, after, mosley, suggested, he, would, stand, for, reelection, fota, made, it, clear, that, breakaway, plans, were, still, being, pursued, on, 8, july, fota, issued, a, press, release, stating, it, had, been, informed, it, was, not, entered, for, the, 2010, season, and, an, fia, press, release, said, the, fota, representatives, had, walked, out, of, the, meeting, on, 1, august, it, was, announced, fia, and, fota, had, signed, a, new, concorde, agreement, bringing, an, end, to, the, crisis, and, securing, the, sport, s, future, until, 2012, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, manufacturer, teams, four, new, teams, were, accepted, entry, into, the, 2010, season, ahead, of, a, much, anticipated, cost, cap, entrants, included, a, reborn, team, lotus, led, by, a, malaysian, consortium, including, tony, fernandes, the, boss, of, air, asia, hispania, racing, the, first, spanish, formula, one, team, and, virgin, racing, richard, branson, s, entry, into, the, series, following, a, successful, partnership, with, brawn, the, year, before, they, were, also, joined, by, the, us, f1, team, which, planned, to, run, out, of, the, united, states, as, the, only, non, european, based, team, in, the, sport, financial, issues, befell, the, squad, before, they, even, made, the, grid, despite, the, entry, of, these, new, teams, the, proposed, cost, cap, was, repealed, and, these, teams, which, did, not, have, the, budgets, of, the, midfield, and, top, order, teams, ran, around, at, the, back, of, the, field, until, they, collapsed, hrt, in, 2012, caterham, formerly, lotus, in, 2014, and, manor, formerly, virgin, then, marussia, having, survived, falling, into, administration, in, 2014, at, the, end, of, 2016, a, major, rule, shakeup, in, 2014, saw, the, 2, 4, litre, naturally, aspirated, v8, engines, replaced, by, 1, 6, litre, turbocharged, hybrid, power, units, this, prompted, honda, to, return, to, the, sport, in, 2015, as, the, championship, s, fourth, power, unit, manufacturer, mercedes, emerged, as, the, dominant, force, after, the, rule, shakeup, with, lewis, hamilton, winning, the, championship, closely, followed, by, his, main, rival, and, teammate, nico, rosberg, with, the, team, winning, 16, out, of, the, 19, races, that, season, the, team, continued, this, form, in, the, next, two, seasons, again, winning, 16, races, in, 2015, before, taking, a, record, 19, wins, in, 2016, with, hamilton, claiming, the, title, in, the, former, year, and, rosberg, winning, it, in, the, latter, by, five, points, the, 2016, season, also, saw, a, new, team, haas, join, the, grid, while, max, verstappen, became, the, youngest, ever, race, winner, at, age, 18, in, spain, after, revised, aerodynamic, regulations, were, introduced, the, 2017, and, 2018, seasons, featured, a, title, battle, between, mercedes, and, ferrari, mercedes, ultimately, won, the, titles, with, multiple, races, to, spare, and, continued, to, dominate, in, the, next, two, years, eventually, winning, seven, consecutive, drivers, championships, from, 2014, to, 2020, and, eight, consecutive, constructors, titles, from, 2014, to, 2021, during, this, eight, year, period, between, 2014, and, 2021, a, mercedes, driver, won, 111, of, the, 160, races, with, hamilton, winning, 81, of, these, and, taking, six, drivers, championships, during, this, period, to, equal, schumacher, s, record, of, seven, titles, in, 2021, the, honda, powered, red, bull, team, began, to, seriously, challenge, mercedes, with, verstappen, beating, hamilton, to, the, drivers, championship, after, a, season, long, battle, that, saw, the, pair, exchange, the, championship, lead, multiple, times, this, era, has, seen, an, increase, in, car, manufacturer, presence, in, the, sport, after, honda, s, return, as, an, engine, manufacturer, in, 2015, renault, came, back, as, a, team, in, 2016, after, buying, back, the, lotus, f1, team, in, 2018, aston, martin, and, alfa, romeo, became, red, bull, and, sauber, s, title, sponsors, respectively, sauber, was, rebranded, as, alfa, romeo, racing, for, the, 2019, season, while, racing, point, part, owner, lawrence, stroll, bought, a, stake, in, aston, martin, to, rebrand, the, racing, point, team, as, aston, martin, for, 2021, in, august, 2020, all, ten, f1, teams, signed, a, new, concorde, agreement, committing, them, to, the, sport, until, 2025, including, a, 145, million, budget, cap, for, car, development, to, support, equal, competition, and, sustainable, development, the, covid, 19, pandemic, forced, the, sport, to, adapt, to, budgetary, and, logistical, limitations, a, significant, overhaul, of, the, technical, regulations, intended, to, be, introduced, in, the, 2021, season, was, pushed, back, to, 2022, with, constructors, instead, using, their, 2020, chassis, for, two, seasons, and, a, token, system, limiting, which, parts, could, be, modified, introduced, the, start, of, the, 2020, season, was, delayed, by, several, months, and, both, it, and, 2021, seasons, were, subject, to, several, postponements, cancellations, and, rescheduling, of, races, due, to, shifting, restrictions, on, international, travel, many, races, took, place, behind, closed, doors, and, with, only, essential, personnel, present, to, maintain, social, distancing, in, 2022, the, f1, governing, body, announced, a, major, rule, and, car, design, change, intended, to, promote, closer, racing, through, the, use, of, ground, effects, new, aerodynamics, larger, wheels, with, low, profile, tyres, and, redesigned, nose, and, wing, regulations, red, bull, emerged, as, the, dominant, force, after, the, rule, shakeup, the, 2022, and, 2023, constructors, and, drivers, championships, were, won, by, red, bull, and, verstappen, with, multiple, races, to, spare, in, 2023, the, fia, opened, applications, for, new, teams, to, enter, formula, 1, in, the, then, near, future, of, the, teams, that, applied, only, andretti, were, approved, by, the, fia, with, them, then, being, rejected, by, formula, one, management, in, early, 2024, the, formula, one, landscape, underwent, a, significant, change, in, the, sphere, of, team, sponsorships, and, collaborations, having, competed, for, five, seasons, under, the, alfa, romeo, name, sauber, introduced, a, title, partnership, with, the, online, casino, stake, com, resulting, in, the, team, s, new, identity, as, stake, f1, team, kick, sauber, sauber, will, hold, stake, s, sponsorship, name, until, the, end, of, 2025, the, regulations, governing, formula, one, are, set, to, be, revised, for, the, 2026, season, with, big, changes, planned, to, help, encourage, closer, and, more, competitive, racing, changes, include, a, formula, one, grand, prix, event, spans, a, weekend, it, typically, begins, with, two, free, practice, sessions, on, friday, and, one, free, practice, session, on, saturday, additional, drivers, commonly, known, as, third, drivers, are, allowed, to, run, on, fridays, but, only, two, cars, may, be, used, per, team, requiring, a, race, driver, to, give, up, their, seat, a, qualifying, session, is, held, after, the, last, free, practice, session, this, session, determines, the, starting, order, for, the, race, on, sunday, each, driver, may, use, no, more, than, thirteen, sets, of, dry, weather, tyres, four, sets, of, intermediate, tyres, and, three, sets, of, wet, weather, tyres, during, a, race, weekend, for, much, of, the, sport, s, history, qualifying, sessions, differed, little, from, practice, sessions, drivers, would, have, one, or, more, sessions, in, which, to, set, their, fastest, time, with, the, grid, order, determined, by, each, driver, s, best, single, lap, with, the, fastest, getting, first, place, on, the, grid, referred, to, as, pole, position, from, 1996, to, 2002, the, format, was, a, one, hour, shootout, this, approach, lasted, until, the, end, of, 2002, before, the, rules, were, changed, again, because, the, teams, were, not, running, in, the, early, part, of, the, session, to, take, advantage, of, better, track, conditions, later, on, grids, were, generally, limited, to, 26, cars, if, the, race, had, more, entries, qualification, would, also, decide, which, drivers, would, start, the, race, during, the, early, 1990s, the, number, of, entries, was, so, high, that, the, worst, performing, teams, had, to, enter, a, pre, qualifying, session, with, the, fastest, cars, allowed, through, to, the, main, qualifying, session, the, qualifying, format, began, to, change, in, the, early, 2000s, with, the, fia, experimenting, with, limiting, the, number, of, laps, determining, the, aggregate, time, over, two, sessions, and, allowing, each, driver, only, one, qualifying, lap, the, current, qualifying, system, was, adopted, in, the, 2006, season, known, as, knock, out, qualifying, it, is, split, into, three, periods, known, as, q1, q2, and, q3, in, each, period, drivers, run, qualifying, laps, to, attempt, to, advance, to, the, next, period, with, the, slowest, drivers, being, knocked, out, of, qualification, but, not, necessarily, the, race, at, the, end, of, the, period, and, their, grid, positions, set, within, the, rearmost, five, based, on, their, best, lap, times, drivers, are, allowed, as, many, laps, as, they, wish, within, each, period, after, each, period, all, times, are, reset, and, only, a, driver, s, fastest, lap, in, that, period, barring, infractions, counts, any, timed, lap, started, before, the, end, of, that, period, may, be, completed, and, will, count, toward, that, driver, s, placement, the, number, of, cars, eliminated, in, each, period, is, dependent, on, the, total, number, of, cars, entered, into, the, championship, currently, with, 20, cars, q1, runs, for, 18, minutes, and, eliminates, the, slowest, five, drivers, during, this, period, any, driver, whose, best, lap, takes, longer, than, 107, of, the, fastest, time, in, q1, will, not, be, allowed, to, start, the, race, without, permission, from, the, stewards, otherwise, all, drivers, proceed, to, the, race, albeit, in, the, worst, starting, positions, this, rule, does, not, affect, drivers, in, q2, or, q3, in, q2, the, 15, remaining, drivers, have, 15, minutes, to, set, one, of, the, ten, fastest, times, and, proceed, to, the, next, period, finally, q3, lasts, 12, minutes, and, sees, the, remaining, ten, drivers, decide, the, first, ten, grid, positions, at, the, beginning, of, the, 2016, formula, 1, season, the, fia, introduced, a, new, qualifying, format, whereby, drivers, were, knocked, out, every, 90, seconds, after, a, certain, amount, of, time, had, passed, in, each, session, the, aim, was, to, mix, up, grid, positions, for, the, race, but, due, to, unpopularity, the, fia, reverted, to, the, above, qualifying, format, for, the, chinese, gp, after, running, the, format, for, only, two, races, each, car, is, allocated, one, set, of, the, softest, tyres, for, use, in, q3, the, cars, that, qualify, for, q3, must, return, them, after, q3, the, cars, that, do, not, qualify, for, q3, can, use, them, during, the, race, as, of, 2022, all, drivers, are, given, a, free, choice, of, tyre, to, use, at, the, start, of, the, grand, prix, whereas, in, previous, years, only, the, drivers, that, did, not, participate, in, q3, had, free, tyre, choice, for, the, start, of, the, race, any, penalties, that, affect, grid, position, are, applied, at, the, end, of, qualifying, grid, penalties, can, be, applied, for, driving, infractions, in, the, previous, or, current, grand, prix, or, for, changing, a, gearbox, or, engine, component, if, a, car, fails, scrutineering, the, driver, will, be, excluded, from, qualifying, but, will, be, allowed, to, start, the, race, from, the, back, of, the, grid, at, the, race, stewards, discretion, 2021, saw, the, trialling, of, a, sprint, qualifying, race, on, the, saturday, of, three, race, weekends, with, the, intention, of, testing, the, new, approach, to, qualifying, the, traditional, qualifying, would, determine, the, starting, order, for, the, sprint, and, the, result, of, the, sprint, would, then, determine, the, start, order, for, the, grand, prix, the, system, returned, for, the, 2022, season, now, titled, the, sprint, from, 2023, sprint, races, no, longer, impacted, the, start, order, for, the, main, race, which, would, be, determined, by, traditional, qualifying, sprints, would, have, their, own, qualifying, session, titled, the, sprint, shootout, such, a, system, made, its, debut, at, the, 2023, azerbaijan, grand, prix, and, is, set, to, be, used, throughout, all, sprint, sessions, in, place, of, the, traditional, second, free, practice, session, sprint, qualifying, sessions, are, run, much, shorter, than, traditional, qualifying, and, each, session, required, teams, to, fit, new, tyres, mediums, for, sq1, and, sq2, and, softs, for, sq3, otherwise, they, cannot, participate, in, the, session, the, race, begins, with, a, warm, up, lap, after, which, the, cars, assemble, on, the, starting, grid, in, the, order, they, qualified, this, lap, is, often, referred, to, as, the, formation, lap, as, the, cars, lap, in, formation, with, no, overtaking, although, a, driver, who, makes, a, mistake, may, regain, lost, ground, the, warm, up, lap, allows, drivers, to, check, the, condition, of, the, track, and, their, car, gives, the, tyres, a, chance, to, warm, up, to, increase, traction, and, grip, and, also, gives, the, pit, crews, time, to, clear, themselves, and, their, equipment, from, the, grid, for, the, race, start, once, all, the, cars, have, formed, on, the, grid, after, the, medical, car, positions, itself, behind, the, pack, a, light, system, above, the, track, indicates, the, start, of, the, race, five, red, lights, are, illuminated, at, intervals, of, one, second, they, are, all, then, extinguished, simultaneously, after, an, unspecified, time, typically, less, than, 3, seconds, to, signal, the, start, of, the, race, the, start, procedure, may, be, abandoned, if, a, driver, stalls, on, the, grid, or, on, the, track, in, an, unsafe, position, signalled, by, raising, their, arm, if, this, happens, the, procedure, restarts, a, new, formation, lap, begins, with, the, offending, car, removed, from, the, grid, the, race, may, also, be, restarted, in, the, event, of, a, serious, accident, or, dangerous, conditions, with, the, original, start, voided, the, race, may, be, started, from, behind, the, safety, car, if, race, control, feels, a, racing, start, would, be, excessively, dangerous, such, as, extremely, heavy, rainfall, as, of, the, 2019, season, there, will, always, be, a, standing, restart, if, due, to, heavy, rainfall, a, start, behind, the, safety, car, is, necessary, then, after, the, track, has, dried, sufficiently, drivers, will, form, up, for, a, standing, start, there, is, no, formation, lap, when, races, start, behind, the, safety, car, under, normal, circumstances, the, winner, of, the, race, is, the, first, driver, to, cross, the, finish, line, having, completed, a, set, number, of, laps, race, officials, may, end, the, race, early, putting, out, a, red, flag, due, to, unsafe, conditions, such, as, extreme, rainfall, and, it, must, finish, within, two, hours, although, races, are, only, likely, to, last, this, long, in, the, case, of, extreme, weather, or, if, the, safety, car, is, deployed, during, the, race, when, a, situation, justifies, pausing, the, race, without, terminating, it, the, red, flag, is, deployed, since, 2005, a, ten, minute, warning, is, given, before, the, race, is, resumed, behind, the, safety, car, which, leads, the, field, for, a, lap, before, it, returns, to, the, pit, lane, before, then, the, race, resumed, in, race, order, from, the, penultimate, lap, before, the, red, flag, was, shown, in, the, 1950s, race, distances, varied, from, 300, km, 190, mi, to, 600, km, 370, mi, the, maximum, race, length, was, reduced, to, 400, km, 250, mi, in, 1966, and, 325, km, 202, mi, in, 1971, the, race, length, was, standardised, to, the, current, 305, km, 190, mi, in, 1989, however, street, races, like, monaco, have, shorter, distances, to, keep, under, the, two, hour, limit, drivers, may, overtake, one, another, for, position, over, the, course, of, the, race, if, a, leader, comes, across, a, backmarker, slower, car, who, has, completed, fewer, laps, the, back, marker, is, shown, a, blue, flag, telling, them, that, they, are, obliged, to, allow, the, leader, to, overtake, them, the, slower, car, is, said, to, be, lapped, and, once, the, leader, finishes, the, race, is, classified, as, finishing, the, race, one, lap, down, a, driver, can, be, lapped, numerous, times, by, any, car, in, front, of, them, a, driver, who, fails, to, complete, more, than, 90, of, the, race, distance, is, shown, as, not, classified, in, the, results, throughout, the, race, drivers, may, make, pit, stops, to, change, tyres, and, repair, damage, from, 1994, to, 2009, inclusive, they, could, also, refuel, different, teams, and, drivers, employ, different, pit, stop, strategies, in, order, to, maximise, their, car, s, potential, three, dry, tyre, compounds, with, different, durability, and, adhesion, characteristics, are, available, to, drivers, over, the, course, of, a, race, drivers, must, use, two, of, the, three, available, compounds, the, different, compounds, have, different, levels, of, performance, and, choosing, when, to, use, which, compound, is, a, key, tactical, decision, to, make, different, tyres, have, different, colours, on, their, sidewalls, this, allows, spectators, to, understand, the, strategies, under, wet, conditions, drivers, may, switch, to, one, of, two, specialised, wet, weather, tyres, with, additional, grooves, one, intermediate, for, mild, wet, conditions, such, as, after, recent, rain, one, full, wet, for, racing, in, or, immediately, after, rain, a, driver, must, make, at, least, one, stop, to, use, two, tyre, compounds, up, to, three, stops, are, typically, made, although, further, stops, may, be, necessary, to, fix, damage, or, if, weather, conditions, change, if, rain, tyres, are, used, drivers, are, no, longer, obliged, to, use, two, types, of, dry, tyres, this, role, involves, managing, the, logistics, of, each, f1, grand, prix, inspecting, cars, in, parc, ferm, before, a, race, enforcing, fia, rules, and, controlling, the, lights, which, start, each, race, as, the, head, of, the, race, officials, the, race, director, also, plays, a, large, role, in, resolving, disputes, among, teams, and, drivers, the, race, director, may, also, refer, incidents, to, the, race, stewards, who, may, give, penalties, such, as, drive, through, penalties, or, stop, and, go, penalties, demotions, on, a, pre, race, start, grid, race, disqualifications, and, fines, should, parties, break, regulations, as, of, 2023, the, race, director, is, niels, wittich, with, herbie, blash, as, a, permanent, advisor, in, the, event, of, an, incident, that, risks, the, safety, of, competitors, or, trackside, race, marshals, race, officials, may, choose, to, deploy, the, safety, car, this, in, effect, suspends, the, race, with, drivers, following, the, safety, car, around, the, track, at, its, speed, in, race, order, with, overtaking, not, permitted, cars, that, have, been, lapped, may, during, the, safety, car, period, and, depending, on, circumstances, permitted, by, the, race, director, be, allowed, to, un, lap, themselves, in, order, to, ensure, a, smoother, restart, and, to, avoid, blue, flags, being, immediately, thrown, upon, the, resumption, of, the, race, with, many, of, the, cars, in, very, close, proximity, to, each, other, the, safety, car, circulates, until, the, danger, is, cleared, after, it, comes, in, the, race, restarts, with, a, rolling, start, pit, stops, are, permitted, under, the, safety, car, since, 2000, the, main, safety, car, driver, has, been, german, ex, racing, driver, bernd, mayl, nder, on, the, lap, in, which, the, safety, car, returns, to, the, pits, the, leading, car, takes, over, the, role, of, the, safety, car, until, the, timing, line, after, crossing, this, line, drivers, are, allowed, to, start, racing, for, track, position, once, more, mercedes, benz, supplies, mercedes, amg, models, to, formula, one, to, use, as, the, safety, cars, from, 2021, onwards, aston, martin, supplies, the, vantage, to, formula, one, to, use, as, the, safety, car, sharing, the, duty, with, mercedes, benz, flags, specifications, and, usage, are, prescribed, by, appendix, h, of, the, fia, s, international, sporting, code, safety, car, virtual, safety, car, the, format, of, the, race, has, changed, little, through, formula, one, s, history, the, main, changes, have, revolved, around, what, is, allowed, at, pit, stops, in, the, early, days, of, grand, prix, racing, a, driver, would, be, allowed, to, continue, a, race, in, their, teammate, s, car, should, theirs, develop, a, problem, in, the, modern, era, cars, are, so, carefully, fitted, to, drivers, that, this, has, become, impossible, in, recent, years, the, emphasis, has, been, on, changing, refuelling, and, tyre, change, regulations, since, the, 2010, season, refuelling, which, was, reintroduced, in, 1994, has, not, been, allowed, to, encourage, less, tactical, racing, following, safety, concerns, the, rule, requiring, both, compounds, of, tyre, to, be, used, during, the, race, was, introduced, in, 2007, again, to, encourage, racing, on, the, track, the, safety, car, is, another, relatively, recent, innovation, that, reduced, the, need, to, deploy, the, red, flag, allowing, races, to, be, completed, on, time, for, a, growing, international, live, television, audience, a, driver, must, finish, within, the, top, ten, to, receive, a, point, for, setting, the, fastest, lap, of, the, race, if, the, driver, who, set, the, fastest, lap, finishes, outside, of, the, top, ten, then, the, point, for, fastest, lap, will, not, be, awarded, for, that, race, various, systems, for, awarding, championship, points, have, been, used, since, 1950, the, current, system, in, place, since, 2010, awards, the, top, ten, cars, points, in, the, drivers, and, constructors, championships, with, the, winner, receiving, 25, points, all, points, won, at, each, race, are, added, up, and, the, driver, and, constructor, with, the, most, points, at, the, end, of, the, season, are, crowned, world, champions, regardless, of, whether, a, driver, stays, with, the, same, team, throughout, the, season, or, switches, teams, all, points, earned, by, them, count, for, the, drivers, championship, a, driver, must, be, classified, in, order, to, receive, points, as, of, 2022, a, driver, must, complete, at, least, 90, of, the, race, distance, in, order, to, receive, points, therefore, it, is, possible, for, a, driver, to, receive, points, even, if, they, retired, before, the, end, of, the, race, from, some, time, between, the, 1977, and, 1980, seasons, to, the, end, of, the, 2021, season, if, less, than, 75, of, the, race, laps, were, completed, by, the, winner, then, only, half, of, the, points, listed, in, the, table, were, awarded, to, the, drivers, and, constructors, this, has, happened, on, only, five, occasions, in, the, history, of, the, championship, and, it, had, a, notable, influence, on, the, final, standing, of, the, 1984, season, the, last, occurrence, was, at, the, 2021, belgian, grand, prix, when, the, race, was, called, off, after, just, three, laps, behind, a, safety, car, due, to, torrential, rain, the, half, points, rule, was, replaced, by, a, distance, dependent, gradual, scale, system, for, 2022, a, formula, one, constructor, is, the, entity, credited, for, designing, the, chassis, and, the, engine, if, both, are, designed, by, the, same, company, that, company, receives, sole, credit, as, the, constructor, e, g, ferrari, if, they, are, designed, by, different, companies, both, are, credited, and, the, name, of, the, chassis, designer, is, placed, before, that, of, the, engine, designer, e, g, mclaren, mercedes, all, constructors, are, scored, individually, even, if, they, share, either, chassis, or, engine, with, another, constructor, e, g, williams, ford, williams, honda, in, 1983, since, 1981, formula, one, teams, have, been, required, to, build, the, chassis, in, which, they, compete, and, consequently, the, distinction, between, the, terms, team, and, constructor, became, less, pronounced, though, engines, may, still, be, produced, by, a, different, entity, this, requirement, distinguishes, the, sport, from, series, such, as, the, indycar, series, which, allows, teams, to, purchase, chassis, and, spec, series, such, as, formula, 2, which, require, all, cars, be, kept, to, an, identical, specification, it, also, effectively, prohibits, privateers, which, were, common, even, in, formula, one, well, into, the, 1970s, the, sport, s, debut, season, 1950, saw, eighteen, teams, compete, but, due, to, high, costs, many, dropped, out, quickly, in, fact, such, was, the, scarcity, of, competitive, cars, for, much, of, the, first, decade, of, formula, one, that, formula, two, cars, were, admitted, to, fill, the, grids, ferrari, is, the, oldest, formula, one, team, the, only, still, active, team, which, competed, in, 1950, early, manufacturer, involvement, came, in, the, form, of, a, factory, team, or, works, team, that, is, one, owned, and, staffed, by, a, major, car, company, such, as, those, of, alfa, romeo, ferrari, or, renault, ferrari, holds, the, record, for, having, won, the, most, constructors, championships, sixteen, companies, such, as, climax, repco, cosworth, hart, judd, and, supertec, which, had, no, direct, team, affiliation, often, sold, engines, to, teams, that, could, not, afford, to, manufacture, them, in, the, early, years, independently, owned, formula, one, teams, sometimes, also, built, their, engines, though, this, became, less, common, with, the, increased, involvement, of, major, car, manufacturers, such, as, bmw, ferrari, honda, mercedes, benz, renault, and, toyota, whose, large, budgets, rendered, privately, built, engines, less, competitive, cosworth, was, the, last, independent, engine, supplier, it, is, estimated, the, major, teams, spend, between, 100, and, 200, million, 125, 225, million, per, year, per, manufacturer, on, engines, alone, in, the, 2007, season, for, the, first, time, since, the, 1981, rule, two, teams, used, chassis, built, by, other, teams, super, aguri, started, the, season, using, a, modified, honda, racing, ra106, chassis, used, by, honda, the, previous, year, while, scuderia, toro, rosso, used, the, same, chassis, used, by, the, parent, red, bull, racing, team, which, was, formally, designed, by, a, separate, subsidiary, the, usage, of, these, loopholes, was, ended, for, 2010, with, the, publication, of, new, technical, regulations, which, require, each, constructor, to, own, the, intellectual, property, rights, to, their, chassis, the, regulations, continue, to, allow, a, team, to, subcontract, the, design, and, construction, of, the, chassis, to, a, third, party, an, option, used, by, the, hrt, team, in, 2010, and, haas, currently, although, teams, rarely, disclose, information, about, their, budgets, it, is, estimated, they, range, from, us, 66, million, to, us, 400, million, each, entering, a, new, team, in, the, formula, one, world, championship, requires, a, 200, million, up, front, payment, to, the, fia, which, is, then, shared, equally, among, the, existing, teams, as, a, consequence, constructors, desiring, to, enter, formula, one, often, prefer, to, buy, an, existing, team, bar, s, purchase, of, tyrrell, and, midland, s, purchase, of, jordan, allowed, both, of, these, teams, to, sidestep, the,

death, of, jules, bianchi, upon, entering, formula, one, and, keeps, that, number, during, their, time, in, the, series, the, number, one, is, reserved, for, the, reigning, drivers, champion, who, retains, their, previous, number, and, may, choose, to, use, it, instead, of, the, number, one, at, the, onset, of, the, championship, numbers, were, allocated, by, race, organisers, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, from, race, to, race, permanent, numbers, were, introduced, in, 1973, to, take, effect, in, 1974, when, teams, were, allocated, numbers, in, ascending, order, based, on, the, constructors, championship, standings, at, the, end, of, the, 1973, season, the, teams, would, hold, those, numbers, from, season, to, season, with, the, exception, of, the, team, with, the, world, drivers, champion, which, would, swap, its, numbers, with, the, one, and, two, of, the, previous, champion, s, team, new, entrants, were, allocated, spare, numbers, with, the, exception, of, the, number, 13, which, had, been, unused, since, 1976, as, teams, kept, their, numbers, for, long, periods, of, time, car, numbers, became, associated, with, a, team, such, as, ferrari, s, 27, and, 28, a, different, system, was, used, from, 1996, to, 2013, at, the, start, of, each, season, the, current, drivers, champion, was, designated, number, one, their, teammate, number, two, and, the, rest, of, the, teams, assigned, ascending, numbers, according, to, previous, season, s, constructors, championship, order, as, of, 2024, a, total, of, 34, separate, drivers, have, won, the, world, drivers, championship, with, michael, schumacher, and, lewis, hamilton, holding, the, record, for, most, championships, with, seven, lewis, hamilton, achieved, the, most, race, wins, too, in, 2020, jochen, rindt, is, the, only, posthumous, world, champion, after, his, points, total, was, not, surpassed, despite, his, fatal, accident, at, the, 1970, italian, grand, prix, with, 4, races, still, remaining, in, the, season, drivers, from, the, united, kingdom, have, been, the, most, successful, in, the, sport, with, 20, championships, among, 10, drivers, and, 313, wins, driving, in, formula, one, is, highly, demanding, physically, with, drivers, typically, burning, around, 1, 000, calories, per, hour, and, losing, 2, 4, kg, 4, 9, lb, of, weight, per, race, a, key, reason, for, the, physical, demands, is, the, extreme, g, forces, generated, by, driving, at, high, speeds, with, modern, formula, one, cars, capable, of, generating, forces, of, up, to, 6, 5, g, s, when, cornering, 6, g, s, when, braking, and, 2, g, s, when, accelerating, when, a, driver, experiences, 6, g, they, will, feel, a, force, equivalent, to, six, times, their, body, weight, for, a, person, weighing, 80, kg, 176, lb, this, would, be, 480, kg, 1, 058, lb, another, factor, is, the, high, temperature, inside, the, car, as, the, engine, is, mounted, directly, behind, the, driver, the, temperature, in, the, cockpit, of, a, formula, one, car, can, be, as, high, as, 60, c, 140, f, and, drivers, have, to, wear, several, layers, of, fireproof, racing, clothing, the, steering, wheel, and, brake, pedal, also, require, considerable, strength, to, operate, before, the, introduction, of, power, steering, in, the, 2000s, drivers, had, to, cope, with, steering, forces, of, up, to, 40, 50, newton, metres, 30, 37, lb, ft, while, achieving, maximum, braking, power, requires, drivers, to, apply, around, 150, kg, 330, lb, of, force, to, the, brake, pedal, drivers, also, need, to, be, light, as, every, extra, kilogram, of, weight, noticeably, reduces, performance, most, f1, drivers, start, in, kart, racing, competitions, and, then, come, up, through, traditional, european, single, seater, series, like, formula, ford, and, formula, renault, to, formula, 3, and, finally, the, gp2, series, gp2, started, in, 2005, replacing, formula, 3000, which, itself, had, replaced, formula, two, as, the, last, major, stepping, stone, into, f1, gp2, was, rebranded, as, the, fia, formula, 2, championship, in, 2017, most, champions, from, this, level, graduate, into, f1, but, 2006, gp2, champion, lewis, hamilton, became, the, first, f2, f3000, or, gp2, champion, to, win, the, formula, one, drivers, title, in, 2008, drivers, are, not, required, to, have, competed, at, this, level, before, entering, formula, one, british, f3, has, supplied, many, f1, drivers, with, champions, including, nigel, mansell, ayrton, senna, and, mika, h, kkinen, having, moved, straight, from, that, series, to, formula, one, and, max, verstappen, made, his, f1, debut, following, a, single, season, in, european, f3, more, rarely, a, driver, may, be, picked, from, an, even, lower, level, as, was, the, case, with, 2007, world, champion, kimi, r, ikk, nen, who, went, straight, from, formula, renault, to, f1, american, open, wheel, car, racing, has, also, contributed, to, the, formula, one, grid, cart, champions, mario, andretti, and, jacques, villeneuve, became, f1, world, champions, while, juan, pablo, montoya, won, seven, races, in, f1, other, cart, also, known, as, champcar, champions, like, michael, andretti, and, alessandro, zanardi, won, no, races, in, f1, other, drivers, have, taken, different, paths, to, f1, damon, hill, raced, motorbikes, and, michael, schumacher, raced, in, sports, cars, albeit, after, climbing, through, the, junior, single, seater, ranks, former, f1, driver, paul, di, resta, raced, in, dtm, until, he, was, signed, with, force, india, in, 2011, the, number, of, grands, prix, held, in, a, season, has, varied, over, the, years, the, inaugural, 1950, world, championship, season, comprised, only, seven, races, while, the, 2021, 2022, and, 2023, seasons, each, contained, 22, races, the, highest, number, of, world, championship, races, in, one, season, there, were, no, more, than, 11, grands, prix, per, season, during, the, early, decades, of, the, championship, although, a, large, number, of, non, championship, formula, one, events, also, took, place, the, number, of, grands, prix, increased, to, an, average, of, 16, to, 17, by, the, late, 1970s, while, non, championship, events, ended, in, 1983, more, grands, prix, began, to, be, held, in, the, 2000s, and, recent, seasons, have, seen, an, average, of, 21, races, 24, races, are, scheduled, for, the, 2024, season, six, of, the, original, seven, races, took, place, in, europe, the, only, non, european, race, that, counted, towards, the, world, championship, in, 1950, was, the, indianapolis, 500, which, was, held, to, different, regulations, and, later, replaced, by, the, united, states, grand, prix, the, f1, championship, gradually, expanded, to, other, non, european, countries, argentina, hosted, the, first, south, american, grand, prix, in, 1953, and, morocco, hosted, the, first, african, world, championship, race, in, 1958, asia, and, oceania, followed, japan, in, 1976, and, australia, in, 1985, and, the, first, race, in, the, middle, east, was, held, in, 2004, the, 19, races, of, the, 2014, season, were, spread, over, every, populated, continent, except, for, africa, with, 10, grands, prix, held, outside, europe, some, of, the, grands, prix, pre, date, the, formation, of, the, world, championship, such, as, the, french, grand, prix, and, were, incorporated, into, the, championship, as, formula, one, races, in, 1950, the, british, and, italian, grands, prix, are, the, only, events, to, have, been, held, every, formula, one, season, other, long, running, races, include, the, belgian, german, and, french, grands, prix, the, monaco, grand, prix, was, first, held, in, 1929, and, has, run, continuously, since, 1955, with, the, exception, of, 2020, and, is, widely, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, prestigious, automobile, races, in, the, world, all, grands, prix, have, traditionally, been, run, during, the, day, until, the, inaugural, singapore, grand, prix, hosted, the, first, formula, one, night, race, in, 2008, which, was, followed, by, the, day, night, abu, dhabi, grand, prix, in, 2009, and, the, bahrain, grand, prix, which, converted, to, a, night, race, in, 2014, other, grands, prix, in, asia, have, had, their, start, times, adjusted, to, benefit, the, european, television, audience, the, following, twenty, four, grands, prix, all, of, which, appeared, on, the, 2024, schedule, have, a, contract, to, be, hosted, at, the, listed, circuits, for, the, 2025, season, bold, denotes, the, grands, prix, scheduled, as, part, of, the, 2024, season, bold, denotes, the, grands, prix, scheduled, as, part, of, the, 2024, season, since, 2008, the, formula, one, group, has, been, targeting, new, destination, cities, to, expand, its, global, reach, with, the, aim, to, produce, races, from, countries, that, have, not, previously, been, involved, in, the, sport, this, initiative, started, with, the, 2008, singapore, grand, prix, formula, one, races, must, be, held, on, grade, one, tracks, the, highest, grade, rating, issued, by, the, fia, for, tracks, the, layout, and, lap, distance, of, each, circuit, can, vary, significantly, as, long, as, they, stay, within, the, fia, s, regulations, in, most, cases, the, tracks, run, in, a, clockwise, direction, although, there, are, a, handful, of, tracks, in, the, championship, that, run, anticlockwise, a, typical, circuit, features, a, stretch, of, straight, road, on, which, the, starting, grid, is, situated, with, the, pit, lane, normally, located, right, next, to, it, the, pit, lane, is, home, to, each, team, s, garage, where, cars, are, stored, and, serviced, before, a, race, during, a, pit, stop, drivers, enter, the, pit, lane, to, change, their, tyres, receive, repairs, or, aerodynamic, adjustments, from, their, pit, crew, or, retire, from, the, race, if, the, car, is, in, a, condition, to, do, so, prior, to, the, 2010, season, pit, stops, also, facilitated, mid, race, refueling, of, the, cars, special, pit, roads, and, track, markings, help, to, make, sure, drivers, pit, and, rejoin, the, track, safely, most, of, the, circuits, currently, in, use, are, specially, constructed, for, competition, but, the, calendar, also, features, several, circuits, that, use, converted, public, streets, to, varying, degrees, these, tracks, include, monaco, melbourne, singapore, baku, miami, jeddah, and, las, vegas, three, time, world, champion, nelson, piquet, famously, described, racing, in, monaco, as, like, riding, a, bicycle, around, your, living, room, the, monaco, grand, prix, holds, a, unique, exception, to, the, fia, s, minimum, race, distance, requirement, the, grand, prix, only, needs, to, last, enough, laps, to, cover, a, distance, of, 260km, versus, the, standard, 305km, circuit, design, to, protect, the, safety, of, drivers, is, becoming, increasingly, sophisticated, as, exemplified, by, the, bahrain, international, circuit, added, in, 2004, and, designed, like, most, of, f1, s, new, circuits, by, hermann, tilke, several, of, the, new, circuits, in, f1, especially, those, designed, by, tilke, have, been, criticised, as, lacking, the, flow, of, such, classics, as, spa, francorchamps, and, imola, his, redesign, of, the, hockenheim, circuit, in, germany, for, example, while, providing, more, capacity, for, grandstands, and, eliminating, extremely, long, and, dangerous, straights, has, been, frowned, upon, by, many, who, argue, that, part, of, the, character, of, the, hockenheim, circuits, was, the, long, and, blinding, straights, into, dark, forest, sections, these, newer, circuits, however, are, generally, agreed, to, meet, the, safety, standards, of, modern, formula, one, better, than, the, older, ones, the, circuit, of, the, americas, in, austin, the, sochi, autodrom, in, sochi, and, the, baku, city, circuit, in, azerbaijan, have, all, been, introduced, as, brand, new, tracks, since, 2012, in, 2020, algarve, international, circuit, debuted, on, the, f1, calendar, as, the, venue, of, the, portuguese, grand, prix, with, the, country, having, last, hosted, a, race, in, 1996, in, 2021, circuit, zandvoort, returned, to, the, f1, calendar, as, the, dutch, grand, prix, having, last, hosted, a, race, in, 1985, the, las, vegas, grand, prix, entered, the, sport, in, 2023, modern, formula, one, cars, are, mid, engined, hybrid, semi, open, cockpit, open, wheel, single, seaters, the, chassis, is, made, largely, of, carbon, fibre, composites, rendering, it, light, but, extremely, stiff, and, strong, the, whole, car, including, the, driver, but, not, fuel, weighs, only, 795, kg, 1, 753, lb, the, minimum, weight, set, by, the, regulations, if, the, construction, of, the, car, is, lighter, than, the, minimum, it, can, be, ballasted, up, to, add, the, necessary, weight, the, race, teams, take, advantage, of, this, by, placing, this, ballast, at, the, extreme, bottom, of, the, chassis, thereby, locating, the, centre, of, gravity, as, low, as, possible, in, order, to, improve, handling, and, weight, transfer, the, cornering, speed, of, formula, one, cars, is, largely, determined, by, the, aerodynamic, downforce, that, they, generate, which, pushes, the, car, down, onto, the, track, this, is, provided, by, wings, mounted, at, the, front, and, rear, of, the, vehicle, and, by, ground, effect, created, by, low, air, pressure, under, the, flat, bottom, of, the, car, the, aerodynamic, design, of, the, cars, is, very, heavily, constrained, to, limit, performance, the, previous, generation, of, cars, sported, a, large, number, of, small, winglets, barge, boards, and, turning, vanes, designed, to, closely, control, the, flow, of, the, air, over, under, and, around, the, car, the, other, major, factor, controlling, the, cornering, speed, of, the, cars, is, the, design, of, the, tyres, from, 1998, to, 2008, the, tyres, in, formula, one, were, not, slicks, tyres, with, no, tread, pattern, as, in, most, other, circuit, racing, series, instead, each, tyre, had, four, large, circumferential, grooves, on, its, surface, designed, to, limit, the, cornering, speed, of, the, cars, slick, tyres, returned, to, formula, one, in, the, 2009, season, suspension, is, double, wishbone, or, multilink, front, and, rear, with, pushrod, operated, springs, and, dampers, on, the, chassis, one, exception, being, that, of, the, 2009, specification, red, bull, racing, car, rb5, which, used, pullrod, suspension, at, the, rear, the, first, car, to, do, so, since, the, minardi, ps01, in, 2001, ferrari, used, a, pullrod, suspension, at, both, the, front, and, rear, in, their, 2012, car, both, ferrari, f138, and, mclaren, mp4, 28, of, the, 2013, season, used, a, pullrod, suspension, at, both, the, front, and, the, rear, in, 2022, mclaren, mcl36, and, red, bull, racing, rb18, switched, to, a, pullrod, front, suspension, and, push, rod, rear, suspension, carbon, carbon, disc, brakes, are, used, for, reduced, weight, and, increased, frictional, performance, these, provide, a, very, high, level, of, braking, performance, and, are, usually, the, element, that, provokes, the, greatest, reaction, from, drivers, new, to, the, formula, in, 2022, the, technical, regulations, changed, considerably, in, order, to, reduce, the, turbulence, commonly, referred, to, as, dirty, air, produced, by, the, aerodynamics, of, the, car, this, includes, a, redesigned, front, and, rear, wing, larger, wheels, with, a, lower, tyre, profile, wheel, covers, small, winglets, the, banning, of, barge, boards, and, the, reintroduction, of, ground, effect, downforce, production, these, have, been, changed, to, promote, racing, meaning, cars, lose, less, downforce, when, following, another, car, it, allows, cars, to, follow, another, at, a, much, closer, distance, without, extending, the, gap, due, to, the, turbulent, air, see, 2022, formula,

the, 2009, formula, one, season, the, engines, were, further, restricted, to, 18, 000, rpm, a, wide, variety, of, technologies, including, active, suspension, are, banned, under, the, current, regulations, despite, this, the, current, generation, of, cars, can, reach, speeds, in, excess, of, 350, km, h, 220, mph, at, some, circuits, the, highest, straight, line, speed, recorded, during, a, grand, prix, was, 372, 6, km, h, 231, 5, mph, set, by, juan, pablo, montoya, during, the, 2005, italian, grand, prix, during, qualifying, for, the, 2016, european, grand, prix, valtteri, bottas, set,

generated, downforce, is, equal, to, the, weight, of, the, car, and, the, oft, repeated, claim, that, formula, one, cars, create, enough, downforce, to, drive, on, the, ceiling, while, possible, in, principle, has, never, been, put, to, the, test, downforce, of, 2, 5, times, the, car, s, weight, can, be, achieved, at, full, speed, the, downforce, means, that, the, cars, can, achieve, a, lateral, force, with, a, magnitude, of, up, to, 3, 5, times, that, of, the, force, of, gravity, 3, 5g, in, cornering, consequently, the, driver, s, head, is, pulled, sideways, with, a, force, equivalent, to, the, weight, of, 20, kg, in, corners, such, high, lateral, forces, are, enough, to, make, breathing, difficult, and, the, drivers, need, supreme, concentration, and, fitness, to, maintain, their, focus, for, the, one, to, two, hours, that, it, takes, to, complete, the, race, a, high, performance, road, car, like, the, enzo, ferrari, only, achieves, around, 1g, as, of, 2019, each, team, may, have, no, more, than, two, cars, available, for, use, at, any, time, each, driver, may, use, no, more, than, four, engines, during, a, championship, season, unless, they, drive, for, more, than, one, team, if, more, engines, are, used, they, drop, ten, places, on, the, starting, grid, of, the, event, at, which, an, additional, engine, is, used, the, only, exception, is, where, the, engine, is, provided, by, a, manufacturer, or, supplier, taking, part, in, its, first, championship, season, in, which, case, up, to, five, may, be, used, by, a, driver, each, driver, may, use, no, more, than,

has, counted, towards, the, world, championship, and, every, world, championship, race, has, been, run, to, formula, one, regulations, however, the, two, terms, are, not, interchangeable, the, distinction, is, most, relevant, when, considering, career, summaries, and, all, time, lists, for, example, in, the, list, of, formula, one, drivers, clemente, biondetti, is, shown, with, a, single, race, against, his, name, biondetti, actually, competed, in, four, formula, one, races, in, 1950, but, only, one, of, these, counted, for, the, world, championship, in, the, earlier, history, of, formula, one, many, races, took, place, outside, the, world, championship, and, local, championships, run, to, formula, one, regulations, also, occurred, these, events, often, took, place, on, circuits, that, were, not, always, suitable, for, the, world, championship, and, featured, local, cars, and, drivers, as, well, as, those, competing, in, the, championship, in, the, early, years, of, formula, one, before, the, world, championship, was, established, there, were, around, twenty, races, held, from, late, spring, to, early, autumn, in, europe, although, not, all, of, these, were, considered, significant, most, competitive, cars, came, from, italy, particularly, alfa, romeo, after, the, start, of, the, world, championship, these, non, championship, races, continued, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, there, were, many, formula, one, races, which, did, not, count, for, the, world, championship, in, 1950, a, total, of, twenty, two, formula, one, races, were, held, of, which, only, six, counted, towards, the, world, championship, in, 1952, and, 1953, when, the, world, championship, was, run, to, formula, two, regulations, non, championship, events, were, the, only, formula, one, races, that, took, place, some, races, particularly, in, the, uk, including, the, race, of, champions, oulton, park, international, gold, cup, and, the, international, trophy, were, attended, by, the, majority, of, the, world, championship, contenders, other, smaller, events, were, regularly, held, in, locations, not, part, of, the, championship, such, as, the, syracuse, and, danish, grands, prix, although, these, only, attracted, a, small, amount, of, the, championship, teams, and, relied, on, private, entries, and, lower, formula, cars, to, make, up, the, grid, these, became, less, common, through, the, 1970s, and, 1983, saw, the, last, non, championship, formula, one, race, the, 1983, race, of, champions, at, brands, hatch, won, by, reigning, world, champion, keke, rosberg, in, a,

making, the, uk, domestic, formula, one, championship, possible, between, 1978, and, 1980, as, in, south, africa, a, decade, before, second, hand, cars, from, manufacturers, like, lotus, and, fittipaldi, automotive, were, the, order, of, the, day, although, some, such, as, the, march, 781, were, built, specifically, for, the, series, in, 1980, the, series, saw, south, african, desir,
