ketchup, or, catsup, k, t, p, k, t, s, u, p, k, t, p, is, a, table, condiment, with, a, sweet, and, sour, flavor, ketchup, now, typically, refers, to, tomato, ketchup, also, known, as, tomato, sauce, outside, of, north, america, although, early, recipes, for, various, different, varieties, of, ketchup, contained, mushrooms, oysters, mussels, egg, whites, grapes, or, walnuts, among, other, ingredients, tomato, ketchup, is, made, from, tomatoes, sugar, and, vinegar, with, seasonings, and, spices, the, spices, and, flavors, vary, but, commonly, include, onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and, mustard, and, sometimes, include, celery, cinnamon, or, ginger, the, market, leader, in, the, united, states, 60, market, share, and, the, united, kingdom, 82, is, heinz, tomato, ketchup, tomato, ketchup, is, often, used, as, a, condiment, to, dishes, that, are, usually, served, hot, and, are, fried, or, greasy, french, fries, and, other, potato, dishes, hamburgers, hot, dogs, chicken, tenders, hot, sandwiches, meat, pies, cooked, eggs, and, grilled, or, fried, meat, ketchup, is, sometimes, used, as, the, basis, for, or, as, one, ingredient, in, other, sauces, and, dressings, and, the, flavor, may, be, replicated, as, an, additive, flavoring, for, snacks, such, as, potato, chips, in, the, united, kingdom, ketchup, was, historically, prepared, with, mushrooms, as, a, primary, ingredient, rather, than, tomatoes, in, the, united, states, mushroom, ketchup, dates, back, to, at, least, 1770, and, was, prepared, by, british, colonists, in, the, thirteen, colonies, many, variations, of, ketchup, were, created, but, the, tomato, based, version, did, not, appear, until, around, a, century, after, other, types, an, early, recipe, for, tomato, catsup, from, 1817, includes, anchovies, by, the, mid, 1850s, the, anchovies, had, been, dropped, the, term, ketchup, first, appeared, in, 1682, ketchup, recipes, began, to, appear, in, british, and, then, american, cookbooks, in, the, 18th, century, james, mease, published, the, first, known, tomato, ketchup, recipe, in, 1812, in, 1824, a, ketchup, recipe, using, tomatoes, appeared, in, the, virginia, housewife, an, influential, 19th, century, cookbook, written, by, mary, randolph, thomas, jefferson, s, cousin, tomato, ketchup, was, sold, locally, by, farmers, jonas, yerkes, is, credited, as, the, first, american, to, sell, it, in, a, bottle, by, 1837, he, had, produced, and, distributed, the, condiment, nationally, shortly, thereafter, other, companies, followed, suit, f, j, heinz, launched, their, tomato, ketchup, in, 1876, american, cooks, also, began, to, sweeten, ketchup, in, the, 19th, century, the, webster, s, dictionary, of, 1913, defined, catsup, as, table, sauce, made, from, mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc, as, the, century, progressed, tomato, ketchup, began, its, ascent, in, popularity, in, the, united, states, tomato, ketchup, was, popular, long, before, fresh, tomatoes, were, people, were, less, hesitant, to, eat, tomatoes, as, part, of, a, highly, processed, product, that, had, been, cooked, and, infused, with, vinegar, and, spices, heinz, tomato, ketchup, was, advertised, blessed, relief, for, mother, and, the, other, women, in, the, household, a, slogan, which, alluded, to, the, lengthy, process, required, to, produce, tomato, ketchup, in, the, home, with, industrial, ketchup, production, and, a, need, for, better, preservation, there, was, a, great, increase, of, sugar, in, ketchup, leading, to, the, typically, sweet, and, sour, formula, of, today, in, australia, it, was, not, until, the, late, 19th, century, that, sugar, was, added, to, tomato, sauce, initially, in, small, quantities, but, today, it, contains, just, as, much, as, american, ketchup, and, only, differed, in, the, proportions, of, tomatoes, salt, and, vinegar, in, early, recipes, while, ketchup, and, tomato, sauce, are, both, sold, in, australia, australian, ketchup, is, sweeter, and, thicker, whereas, australian, tomato, sauce, is, more, sour, and, runny, modern, ketchup, emerged, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, out, of, a, debate, over, the, use, of, sodium, benzoate, as, a, preservative, in, condiments, harvey, w, wiley, the, father, of, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, challenged, the, safety, of, benzoate, which, was, banned, in, the, 1906, pure, food, and, drug, act, in, response, entrepreneurs, including, henry, j, heinz, pursued, an, alternative, recipe, that, eliminated, the, need, for, that, preservative, katherine, bitting, a, bacteriologist, working, for, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, carried, out, research, in, 1909, that, proved, increasing, the, sugar, and, vinegar, content, of, the, product, would, prevent, spoilage, without, use, of, artificial, preservatives, she, was, assisted, by, her, husband, arvil, bitting, an, official, at, that, agency, prior, to, heinz, and, his, fellow, innovators, commercial, tomato, ketchups, of, that, time, were, watery, and, thin, in, part, because, they, used, unripe, tomatoes, which, were, low, in, pectin, they, had, less, vinegar, than, modern, ketchups, by, pickling, ripe, tomatoes, the, need, for, benzoate, was, eliminated, without, spoilage, or, degradation, in, flavor, but, the, changes, driven, by, the, desire, to, eliminate, benzoate, also, produced, changes, that, some, experts, such, as, andrew, f, smith, believe, were, key, to, the, establishment, of, tomato, ketchup, as, the, dominant, american, condiment, in, fast, food, outlets, ketchup, is, often, dispensed, in, small, sachets, or, tubs, diners, tear, the, side, or, top, and, squeeze, the, ketchup, out, of, the, ketchup, packets, or, peel, the, foil, lid, off, the, tub, for, dipping, in, 2011, heinz, began, offering, a, new, measured, portion, package, called, the, dip, and, squeeze, packet, which, can, be, opened, in, either, way, giving, both, options, some, fast, food, outlets, previously, dispensed, ketchup, from, hand, operated, pumps, into, paper, cups, this, method, has, made, a, comeback, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 21st, century, as, cost, and, environmental, concerns, over, the, increasing, use, of, individual, plastic, ketchup, tubs, were, taken, into, account, in, october, 2000, heinz, introduced, colored, ketchup, products, called, ez, squirt, which, eventually, included, green, 2000, purple, 2001, mystery, pink, orange, or, teal, 2002, and, blue, 2003, these, products, were, made, by, adding, food, coloring, to, the, traditional, ketchup, by, january, 2006, these, products, were, discontinued, the, term, used, for, the, sauce, varies, ketchup, is, the, dominant, term, in, american, english, and, canadian, english, although, catsup, is, commonly, used, in, some, southern, us, states, and, mexico, in, canada, and, the, us, tomato, sauce, is, not, a, synonym, for, ketchup, but, is, a, sauce, made, from, tomatoes, and, commonly, used, in, making, sauce, for, pasta, the, etymology, of, the, word, ketchup, is, unclear, and, has, multiple, competing, theories, a, popular, folk, etymology, is, that, the, word, came, to, english, from, the, cantonese, ke, 2, zap, 1, literally, meaning, tomato, sauce, in, cantonese, the, character, means, eggplant, tomato, in, cantonese, is, which, literally, translates, to, foreign, eggplant, another, theory, among, academics, is, that, the, word, derives, from, one, of, two, words, from, hokkien, of, the, fujian, region, of, coastal, southern, china, k, e, chiap, in, the, amoy, xiamen, dialect, and, quanzhou, dialect, or, k, chiap, in, the, zhangzhou, dialect, both, of, these, pronunciations, of, the, same, word, k, e, chiap, k, chiap, come, from, the, quanzhou, dialect, amoy, dialect, and, zhangzhou, dialect, of, hokkien, respectively, where, it, meant, the, brine, of, pickled, fish, or, shellfish, pickled, food, usually, seafood, juice, there, are, citations, of, koe, chiap, in, the, chinese, english, dictionary, of, the, vernacular, or, spoken, language, of, amoy, 1873, by, carstairs, douglas, defined, as, brine, of, pickled, fish, or, shell, fish, ketchup, may, have, entered, the, english, language, from, the, malay, word, kicap, pronounced, sometimes, spelled, kecap, or, ketjap, originally, meaning, soy, sauce, the, word, itself, derives, from, chinese, in, indonesian, cuisine, which, is, similar, to, malay, the, term, kecap, refers, to, fermented, savory, sauces, two, main, types, are, well, known, in, their, cuisine, kecap, asin, which, translates, to, salty, kecap, in, indonesian, a, salty, soy, sauce, and, kecap, manis, or, sweet, kecap, in, indonesian, kecap, manis, is, a, sweet, soy, sauce, that, is, a, mixture, of, soy, sauce, with, brown, sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander, and, a, bay, leaf, reduced, over, medium, heat, until, rather, syrupy, a, third, type, kecap, ikan, meaning, fish, kecap, is, fish, sauce, similar, to, the, thai, nam, pla, or, the, philippine, patis, it, is, not, however, soy, based, american, anthropologist, e, n, anderson, relies, on, elizabeth, david, to, claim, that, ketchup, is, a, cognate, of, the, french, escaveche, meaning, food, in, sauce, the, word, also, exists, in, spanish, and, portuguese, forms, as, escabeche, a, sauce, for, pickling, which, culinary, historian, karen, hess, traced, back, to, arabic, kabees, or, pickling, with, vinegar, the, term, was, anglicized, to, caveach, a, word, first, attested, in, the, late, 17th, century, at, the, same, time, as, ketchup, the, word, entered, the, english, language, in, britain, during, the, late, 17th, century, appearing, in, print, as, catchup, 1690, and, later, as, ketchup, 1711, the, following, is, a, list, of, early, quotations, collected, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, u, s, heinz, tomato, ketchup, s, ingredients, listed, from, highest, to, lowest, percentage, weight, are, tomato, concentrate, from, red, ripe, tomatoes, distilled, vinegar, high, fructose, corn, syrup, corn, syrup, salt, spice, onion, powder, and, natural, flavoring, some, ketchup, in, the, u, s, is, labeled, fancy, a, usda, grade, related, to, specific, gravity, fancy, ketchup, has, a, higher, tomato, solid, concentration, than, other, usda, grades, the, following, table, compares, the, nutritional, value, of, ketchup, with, raw, ripe, tomatoes, and, salsa, based, on, information, from, the, usda, food, nutrient, database, commercial, tomato, ketchup, has, an, additive, usually, xanthan, gum, which, gives, the, condiment, a, non, newtonian, pseudoplastic, or, shear, thinning, property, more, commonly, known, as, thixotropic, this, increases, the, viscosity, of, the, ketchup, considerably, with, a, relatively, small, amount, added, usually, 0, 5, which, can, make, it, difficult, to, pour, from, a, container, however, the, shear, thinning, property, of, the, gum, ensures, that, when, a, force, is, applied, to, the, ketchup, it, will, lower, the, viscosity, enabling, the, sauce, to, flow, a, common, method, to, getting, ketchup, out, of, the, bottle, involves, inverting, the, bottle, and, shaking, it, or, hitting, the, bottom, with, the, heel, of, the, hand, which, causes, the, ketchup, to, flow, rapidly, ketchup, in, plastic, bottles, can, be, additionally, manipulated, by, squeezing, the, bottle, which, also, decreases, the, viscosity, of, the, ketchup, inside, another, technique, involves, inverting, the, bottle, and, forcefully, tapping, its, upper, neck, with, two, fingers, index, and, middle, finger, together, specifically, with, a, heinz, ketchup, glass, bottle, one, taps, the, 57, circle, on, the, neck, this, helps, the, ketchup, flow, by, applying, the, correct, shearing, force, these, techniques, work, because, of, how, pseudoplastic, fluids, behave, their, viscosity, resistance, to, flow, decreases, with, increasing, shear, rate, the, faster, the, ketchup, is, sheared, by, shaking, or, tapping, the, bottle, the, more, fluid, it, becomes, after, the, shear, is, removed, the, ketchup, thickens, to, its, original, viscosity, ketchup, is, a, non, newtonian, fluid, meaning, that, its, viscosity, changes, under, stress, and, is, not, constant, it, is, a, shear, thinning, fluid, which, means, its, viscosity, decreases, with, increased, shear, stress, the, equation, used, to, designate, a, non, newtonian, fluid, is, as, follows, y, displaystyle, eta, tau, dot, y, this, equation, represents, apparent, viscosity, where, apparent, viscosity, is, the, shear, stress, divided, by, shear, rate, viscosity, is, dependent, on, stress, this, is, apparent, when, you, shake, a, bottle, of, tomato, sauce, ketchup, so, it, becomes, liquid, enough, to, squirt, out, its, viscosity, decreased, with, stress, the, molecular, composition, of, ketchup, is, what, creates, its, pseudoplastic, characteristics, small, polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and, water, make, up, the, majority, of, the, metastable, ketchup, product, and, these, small, structures, are, able, to, move, more, easily, throughout, a, matrix, because, of, their, low, mass, while, exposed, to, shear, stress, the, molecules, within, the, suspension, are, able, to, respond, quickly, and, create, an, alignment, within, the, product, the, bonds, between, the, molecules, are, mostly, hydrogen, bonds, ionic, interactions, and, electrostatic, interactions, all, of, which, can, be, broken, when, subject, to, stress, hydrogen, bonds, are, constantly, rearranging, within, a, product, due, to, their, need, to, be, in, the, lowest, energy, state, which, further, confirms, that, the, bonds, between, the, molecules, will, be, easily, disrupted, this, alignment, only, lasts, for, as, long, as, shear, stress, is, applied, the, molecules, return, to, their, original, disorganized, state, once, the, shear, stress, dissipates, in, 2017, researchers, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, reported, the, development, of, a, bottle, coating, that, allowed, all, the, product, to, slip, out, without, leaving, a, residue, in, 2022, researchers, at, the, university, of, oxford, found, that, splatter, from, a, near, empty, bottle, can, be, prevented, by, squeezing, more, slowly, and, doubling, the, diameter, of, the, nozzle, ketchup, is, one, of, the, many, products, that, are, leachable, meaning, that, the, water, within, the, product, migrates, together, as, the, larger, molecules, within, the, product, sediment, ultimately, causing, water, to, separate, out, this, forms, a, layer, of, water, on, top, of, the, ketchup, due, to, the, molecular, instability, within, the, product, this, instability, is, caused, by, interactions, between, hydrophobic, molecules, and, charged, molecules, within, the, ketchup, suspension, pectin, is, a, polysaccharide, within, tomatoes, that, has, the, ability, to, bind, to, itself, and, to, other, molecules, especially, water, around, it, this, enables, it, to, create, a, gel, like, matrix, dependent, on, the, amount, within, the, solution, water, is, a, large, part, of, ketchup, due, to, it, being, 80, of, the, composition, of, distilled, vinegar, in, order, for, the, water, within, the, ketchup, to, be, at, the, lowest, possible, energy, state, all, of, the, hydrogen, bonds, that, are, able, to, be, made, within, the, matrix, must, be, made, the, water, bound, to, the, polysaccharide, moves, more, slowly, within, the, matrix, which, is, unfavorable, with, respect, to, entropy, the, increased, order, within, the, polysaccharide, water, complex, gives, rise, to, a, high, energy, state, in, which, the, water, will, want, to, be, relieved, this, concept, implies, that, water, will, more, favorably, bind, with, itself, because, of, the, increased, disorder, between, water, molecules, this, is, partially, the, cause, for, water, leaching, out, of, solution, when, left, undisturbed, for, a, short, period, of, time
