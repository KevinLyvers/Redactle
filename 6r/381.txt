recommended, a, line, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, from, and, parallel, to, the, net, is, considered, the, attack, line, this, 3, meter, or, 10, foot, line, divides, the, court, into, back, row, and, front, row, areas, and, the, back, court, and, front, court, these, are, in, turn, divided, into, 3, areas, each, these, are, numbered, as, follows, starting, from, area, 1, which, is, the, position, of, the,

of, 3, meters, wide, and, which, the, players, may, enter, and, play, within, after, the, service, of, the, ball, all, lines, denoting, the, boundaries, of, the, team, court, and, the, attack, zone, are, drawn, or, painted, within, the, dimensions, of, the, area, and, are, therefore, a, part, of, the, court, or, zone, if, a, ball, comes, in, contact, with, the, line, the, ball, is, considered, to, be, in, an, antenna, is, placed, on, each, side, of, the, net, perpendicular, to, the, sideline, and, is, a, vertical, extension, of, the, side, boundary, of, the, court, a, ball, passing, over,

such, that, it, will, land, in, the, opposing, team, s, court, the, serve, the, opposing, team, must, use, a, combination, of, no, more, than, three, contacts, with, the, volleyball, to, return, the, ball, to, the, opponent, s, side, of, the, net, these, contacts, usually, consist, first, of, the, bump, or, pass, so, that, the, ball, s, trajectory, is, aimed, towards, the, player, designated, as, the, setter, second, of, the, set, usually, an, over, hand, pass, using, wrists, to, push, finger, tips, at, the, ball, by, the, setter, so, that, the, ball, s, trajectory, is, aimed, towards, a, spot, where, one, of, the, players, designated, as, an, attacker, can, hit, it, and, third, by, the, attacker, who, spikes, jumping, raising, one, arm, above, the, head, and, hitting, the, ball, so, it, will, move, quickly, down, to, the, ground, on, the, opponent, s, court, to, return, the, ball, over, the, net, the, team, with, possession, of, the, ball, that, is, trying, to, attack, the, ball,

the, game, continues, in, this, manner, rallying, back, and, forth, until, the, ball, touches, the, court, within, the, boundaries, or, until, an, error, is, made, the, most, frequent, errors, that, are, made, are, either, to, fail, to, return, the, ball, over, the, net, within, the, allowed, three, touches, or, to, cause, the, ball, to, land, outside, the, court, a, ball, is, in, if, any, part, of, it, touches, the, inside, of, a, team, s, court, or, a, sideline, or, end, line, and, a, strong, spike, may, compress, the, ball, enough, when, it, lands, that, a, ball, which, at, first, appears, to, be, going, out, may, actually, be, in, players, may, travel, well, outside, the, court, to, play, a, ball, that, has, gone, over, a, sideline, or, end, line, in, the, air, a, standard,

the, ball, is, counted, as, in, the, court, the, team, that, won, the, point, serves, for, the, next, point, if, the, team, which, won, the, point, served, in, the, previous, point, the, same, player,

points, the, fivb, changed, the, rules, in, 1999, with, the, changes, being, compulsory, in, 2000, to, use, the, current, scoring, system, formerly, known, as, rally, point, system, primarily, to, make, the, length, of, the, match, more, predictable, and, to, make, the, game, more, spectator, and, television, friendly, the, final, year, of, side, out, scoring, at, the, ncaa, division, i, women, s, volleyball, championship, was, 2000, rally, point, scoring, debuted, in, 2001, and, games, were, played, to, 30, points, through, 2007, for, the, 2008, season, games, were, renamed, sets, and, reduced, to, 25, points, to, win, most, high, schools, in, the, u, s, changed, to, rally, scoring, in, 2003, and, several, states, implemented, it, the, previous, year, on, an, experimental, basis, the, libero, player, was, introduced, internationally, in, 1998, and, made, its, debut, for, ncaa, competition, in, 2002, the, libero, is, a, player, specialized, in, defensive, skills, the, libero, must, wear, a, contrasting, jersey, color, from, their, teammates, and, cannot, block, or, attack, the, ball, when, it, is, entirely, above, net, height, when, the, ball, is, not, in, play, the, libero, can, replace, any, back, row, player, without, prior, notice, to, the, officials, this, replacement, does, not, count, against, the, substitution, limit, each, team, is, allowed, per, set, although, the, libero, may, be, replaced, only, by, the, player, whom, he, or, she, replaced, most, u, s, high, schools, added, the, libero, position, from, 2003, to, 2005, the, modern, day, libero, often, takes, on, the, role, of, a, second, setter, when, the, setter, digs, the, ball, the, libero, is, typically, responsible, for, the, second, ball, and, sets, to, the, front, row, attacker, the, libero, may, function, as, a, setter, only, under, certain, restrictions, to, make, an, overhand, set, the, libero, must, be, standing, behind, and, not, stepping, on, the, 3, meter, line, otherwise, the, ball, cannot, be, attacked, above, the, net, in, front, of, the, 3, meter, line, an, underhand, pass, is, allowed, from, any, part, of, the, court, the, libero, is, generally, the, most, skilled, defensive, player, on, the, team, there, is, also, a, libero, tracking, sheet, where, the, referees, or, officiating, team, must, keep, track, of, whom, the, libero, subs, in, and, out, for, under, fivb, rules, a, libero, is, not, allowed, to, serve, by, contrast, a, libero, can, serve, in, ncaa, volleyball, but, only, in, a, specific, rotation, that, is, the, libero, can, only, serve, for, one, person, not, for, all, of, the, people, for, whom, he, or, she, goes, in, that, rule, change, was, implemented, in, 2004, and, applied, to, high, school, and, junior, high, play, soon, after, under, fivb, rules, each, team, can, designate, two, liberos, at, the, beginning, of, play, only, one, of, whom, can, be, on, the, court, at, any, time, and, each, libero, can, serve, in, one, specific, rotation, this, rule, was, implemented, in, ncaa, women, s, volleyball, effective, with, the, fall, 2024, season, other, rule, changes, enacted, in, 2000, include, allowing, serves, in, which, the, ball, touches, the, net, as, long, as, it, goes, over, the, net, into, the, opponents, court, also, the, service, area, was, expanded, to, allow, players, to, serve, from, anywhere, behind, the, end, line, but, still, within, the, theoretical, extension, of, the, sidelines, other, changes, were, made, to, lighten, up, calls, on, faults, for, carries, and, double, touches, such, as, allowing, multiple, contacts, by, a, single, player, double, hits, on, a, team, s, first, contact, provided, that, they, are, a, part, of, a, single, play, on, the, ball, in, 2008, the, ncaa, changed, the, minimum, number, of, points, needed, to, win, any, of, the, first, four, sets, from, 30, to, 25, for, women, s, volleyball, men, s, volleyball, remained, at, 30, for, another, three, years, switching, to, 25, in, 2011, if, a, fifth, deciding, set, is, reached, the, minimum, required, score, remains, at, 15, in, addition, the, word, game, is, now, referred, to, as, set, the, official, volleyball, rules, are, prepared, and, updated, every, few, years, by, the, fivb, s, rules, of, the, game, and, refereeing, commission, the, latest, edition, is, usually, available, on, the, fivb, s, website, competitive, teams, master, six, basic, skills, serve, pass, set, attack, block, and, dig, each, of, the, skills, consitsts, of, a, number, of, specific, techniques, which, have, been, introduced, over, the, years, and, are, now, considered, standard, practice, in, high, level, volleyball, a, player, stands, behind, the, inline, and, serves, the, ball, in, an, attempt, to, drive, it, into, the, opponent, s, court, the, main, objective, is, to, make, it, land, inside, the, court, it, is, also, desirable, to, set, the, ball, s, direction, speed, and, acceleration, so, that, it, becomes, difficult, for, the, receiver, to, handle, it, properly, a, serve, is, called, an, ace, when, the, ball, either, lands, directly, onto, the, opponent, s, court, or, the, first, opponent, to, touch, the, ball, is, unable, to, volley, it, hit, it, upwards, enough, for, a, teammate, to, continue, in, contemporary, volleyball, many, types, of, serves, are, employed, also, called, reception, the, pass, is, the, attempt, by, a, team, to, properly, handle, the, opponent, s, serve, or, any, form, of, attack, proper, handling, includes, not, only, preventing, the, ball, from, touching, the, court, but, also, making, it, reach, the, position, where, the, setter, is, standing, quickly, and, precisely, the, skill, of, passing, involves, fundamentally, two, specific, techniques, underarm, pass, or, bump, where, the, ball, touches, the, inside, part, of, the, joined, forearms, or, platform, at, waistline, and, overhand, pass, where, it, is, handled, with, the, fingertips, like, a, set, above, the, head, either, are, acceptable, in, professional, and, beach, volleyball, however, there, are, much, tighter, regulations, on, the, overhand, pass, in, beach, volleyball, when, a, player, passes, a, ball, to, their, setter, it, is, ideal, that, the, ball, does, not, have, a, lot, of, spin, to, make, it, easier, for, the, setter, the, set, is, usually, the, second, contact, that, a, team, makes, with, the, ball, the, main, goal, of, setting, is, to, put, the, ball, in, the, air, in, such, a, way, that, it, can, be, driven, by, an, attack, into, the, opponent, s, court, the, setter, coordinates, the, offensive, movements, of, a, team, and, is, the, player, who, ultimately, decides, which, player, will, actually, attack, the, ball, as, with, passing, one, may, distinguish, between, an, overhand, and, a, bump, set, since, the, former, allows, for, more, control, over, the, speed, and, direction, of, the, ball, the, bump, is, used, only, when, the, ball, is, so, low, it, cannot, be, properly, handled, with, fingertips, or, in, beach, volleyball, where, rules, regulating, overhand, setting, are, more, stringent, in, the, case, of, a, set, one, also, speaks, of, a, front, or, back, set, meaning, whether, the, ball, is, passed, in, the, direction, the, setter, is, facing, or, behind, the, setter, there, is, also, a, jump, set, that, is, used, when, the, ball, is, too, close, to, the, net, in, this, case, the, setter, usually, jumps, off, their, right, foot, straight, up, to, avoid, going, into, the, net, the, setter, usually, stands, about, of, the, way, from, the, left, to, the, right, of, the, net, and, faces, the, left, the, larger, portion, of, net, that, the, setter, can, see, sometimes, a, setter, refrains, from, raising, the, ball, for, a, teammate, to, perform, an, attack, and, tries, to, play, it, directly, onto, the, opponent, s, court, this, movement, is, called, a, dump, this, can, only, be, performed, when, the, setter, is, in, the, front, row, otherwise, it, constitutes, an, illegal, back, court, attack, the, most, common, dumps, are, to, throw, the, ball, behind, the, setter, or, in, front, of, the, setter, to, zones, 2, and, 4, more, experienced, setters, toss, the, ball, into, the, deep, corners, or, spike, the, ball, on, the, second, hit, as, with, a, set, or, an, overhand, pass, the, setter, passer, must, be, careful, to, touch, the, ball, with, both, hands, at, the, same, time, if, one, hand, is, noticeably, late, to, touch, the, ball, this, could, result, in, a, less, effective, set, as, well, as, the, referee, calling, a, double, hit, and, giving, the, point, to, the, opposing, team, the, attack, also, known, as, the, spike, is, usually, the, third, contact, a, team, makes, with, the, ball, the, object, of, attacking, is, to, handle, the, ball, so, that, it, lands, on, the, opponent, s, court, and, cannot, be, defended, a, player, makes, a, series, of, steps, the, approach, jumps, and, swings, at, the, ball, ideally, the, contact, with, the, ball, is, made, at, the, apex, of, the, hitter, s, jump, at, the, moment, of, contact, the, hitter, s, arm, is, fully, extended, above, their, head, and, slightly, forward, making, the, highest, possible, contact, while, maintaining, the, ability, to, deliver, a, powerful, hit, the, hitter, uses, arm, swing, wrist, snap, and, a, rapid, forward, contraction, of, the, entire, body, to, drive, the, ball, a, bounce, is, a, slang, term, for, a, very, hard, loud, spike, that, follows, an, almost, straight, trajectory, steeply, downward, into, the, opponent, s, court, and, bounces, very, high, into, the, air, a, kill, is, the, slang, term, for, an, attack, that, is, not, returned, by, the, other, team, thus, resulting, in, a, point, contemporary, volleyball, comprises, a, number, of, attacking, techniques, blocking, refers, to, the, actions, taken, by, players, standing, at, the, net, to, stop, or, alter, an, opponent, s, attack, a, block, which, is, aimed, at, completely, stopping, an, attack, thus, making, the, ball, remain, in, the, opponent, s, court, is, called, an, offensive, block, a, well, executed, offensive, block, is, performed, by, jumping, and, reaching, to, penetrate, with, one, s, arms, and, hands, over, the, net, and, into, the, opponent, s, area, it, requires, anticipating, the, direction, the, ball, will, go, once, the, attack, takes, place, it, may, also, require, calculating, the, best, footwork, to, executing, the, perfect, block, the, jump, should, be, timed, so, as, to, intercept, the, ball, s, trajectory, prior, to, it, crossing, over, the, plane, of, the, net, palms, are, held, deflected, downward, roughly, 45, 60, degrees, toward, the, interior, of, the, opponents, court, a, roof, is, a, spectacular, offensive, block, that, redirects, the, power, and, speed, of, the, attack, straight, down, to, the, attacker, s, floor, as, if, the, attacker, hit, the, ball, into, the, underside, of, a, peaked, house, roof, by, contrast, it, is, called, a, defensive, or, soft, block, if, the, goal, is, to, control, and, deflect, the, hard, driven, ball, up, so, that, it, slows, down, and, becomes, easier, to, defend, a, well, executed, soft, block, is, performed, by, jumping, and, placing, one, s, hands, above, the, net, with, no, penetration, into, the, opponent, s, court, and, with, the, palms, up, and, fingers, pointing, backwards, blocking, is, also, classified, according, to, the, number, of, players, involved, thus, there, are, single, or, solo, double, and, triple, blocks, successful, blocking, does, not, always, result, in, a, roof, and, many, times, does, not, even, touch, the, ball, while, it, is, obvious, that, a, block, was, a, success, when, the, attacker, is, roofed, a, block, that, consistently, forces, the, attacker, away, from, their, power, or, preferred, attack, into, a, more, easily, controlled, shot, by, the, defence, is, also, a, highly, successful, block, at, the, same, time, the, block, position, influences, the, positions, where, other, defenders, place, themselves, while, opponent, hitters, are, spiking, digging, is, the, ability, to, prevent, the, ball, from, touching, one, s, court, after, a, spike, or, attack, particularly, a, ball, that, is, nearly, touching, the, ground, in, many, aspects, this, skill, is, similar, to, passing, or, bumping, overhand, dig, and, bump, are, also, used, to, distinguish, between, defensive, actions, taken, with, fingertips, or, with, joined, arms, it, varies, from, passing, however, in, that, it, is, a, much, more, reflex, based, skill, especially, at, the, higher, levels, it, is, especially, important, while, digging, for, players, to, stay, on, their, toes, several, players, choose, to, employ, a, split, step, to, make, sure, they, are, ready, to, move, in, any, direction, some, specific, techniques, are, more, common, in, digging, than, in, passing, a, player, may, sometimes, perform, a, dive, i, e, throw, their, body, in, the, air, with, a, forward, movement, in, an, attempt, to, save, the, ball, and, land, on, their, chest, when, the, player, also, slides, their, hand, under, a, ball, which, is, almost, touching, the, court, it, is, called, a, pancake, the, pancake, is, frequently, used, in, indoor, volleyball, but, rarely, if, ever, in, beach, volleyball, because, the, uneven, and, yielding, nature, of, the, sand, court, limits, the, chances, that, the, ball, will, make, good, clean, contact, with, the, hand, when, used, correctly, it, is, one, of, the, more, spectacular, defensive, volleyball, plays, sometimes, a, player, may, also, be, forced, to, drop, their, body, quickly, to, the, floor, to, save, the, ball, in, this, situation, the, player, makes, use, of, a, specific, rolling, technique, to, minimize, the, chances, of, injuries, volleyball, is, essentially, a, game, of, transition, from, one, of, the, above, skills, to, the, next, with, choreographed, team, movement, between, plays, on, the, ball, the, team, s, movements, are, determined, by, the, teams, chosen, serve, receive, system, offensive, system, coverage, system, and, defensive, system, the, serve, receive, system, is, the, formation, used, by, the, receiving, team, to, attempt, to, pass, the, ball, to, the, designated, setter, systems, can, consist, of, 5, receivers, 4, receivers, 3, receivers, and, in, some, cases, 2, receivers, the, most, popular, formation, at, higher, levels, is, a, 3, receiver, formation, consisting, of, two, left, sides, and, a, libero, receiving, every, rotation, this, allows, middles, and, right, sides, to, become, more, specialized, at, hitting, and, blocking, offensive, systems, are, the, formations, used, by, the, offence, to, attempt, to, ground, the, ball, into, the, opposing, court, or, otherwise, score, points, formations, often, include, designated, player, positions, with, skill, specialization, see, player, specialization, below, popular, formations, include, the, 4, 2, 6, 2, and, 5, 1, systems, see, formations, below, there, are, also, several, different, attacking, schemes, teams, can, use, to, keep, the, opposing, defence, off, balance, coverage, systems, are, the, formations, used, by, the, offence, to, protect, their, court, in, the, case, of, a, blocked, attack, executed, by, the, 5, offensive, players, not, directly, attacking, the, ball, players, move, to, assigned, positions, around, the, attacker, to, dig, up, any, ball, that, deflects, off, the, block, back, into, their, own, court, popular, formations, include, the, 2, 3, system, and, the, 1, 2, 2, system, in, lieu, of, a, system, some, teams, just, use, a, random, coverage, with, the, players, nearest, the, hitter, defensive, systems, are, the, formations, used, by, the, defence, to, protect, against, the, ball, being, grounded, into, their, court, by, the, opposing, team, the, system, will, outline, which, players, are, responsible, for, which, areas, of, the, court, depending, on, where, the, opposing, team, is, attacking, from, popular, systems, include, the, 6, up, 6, back, deep, and, 6, back, slide, defence, there, are, also, several, different, blocking, schemes, teams, can, employ, to, disrupt, the, opposing, teams, offence, when, one, player, is, ready, to, serve, some, teams, will, line, up, their, other, five, players, in, a, screen, to, obscure, the, view, of, the, receiving, team, this, action, is, only, illegal, if, the, server, makes, use, of, the, screen, so, the, call, is, made, at, the, referee, s, discretion, as, to, the, impact, the, screen, made, on, the, receiving, team, s, ability, to, pass, the, ball, the, most, common, style, of, screening, involves, a, w, formation, designed, to, take, up, as, much, horizontal, space, as, possible, there, are, five, positions, filled, on, every, volleyball, team, at, the, elite, level, setter, outside, hitter, left, side, hitter, middle, hitter, middle, blocker, opposite, hitter, right, side, hitter, and, libero, defensive, specialist, each, of, the, positions, plays, a, specific, key, role, in, winning, a, volleyball, match, at, some, levels, where, substitutions, are, unlimited, teams, will, make, use, of, a, defensive, specialist, in, place, of, or, in, addition, to, a, libero, this, position, does, not, have, unique, rules, like, the, libero, position, instead, these, players, are, used, to, substitute, out, a, poor, back, row, defender, using, regular, substitution, rules, a, defensive, specialist, is, often, used, if, you, have, a, particularly, poor, back, court, defender, in, right, side, or, left, side, but, your, team, is, already, using, a, libero, to, take, out, your, middles, most, often, the, situation, involves, a, team, using, a, right, side, player, with, a, big, block, who, must, be, subbed, out, in, the, back, row, because, they, are, not, able, to, effectively, play, backcourt, defence, similarly, teams, might, use, a, serving, specialist, to, sub, out, a, poor, server, the, three, standard, volleyball, formations, are, known, as, 4, 2, 6, 2, and, 5, 1, which, refers, to, the, number, of, hitters, and, setters, respectively, 4, 2, is, a, basic, formation, used, only, in, beginners, play, while, 5, 1, is, by, far, the, most, common, formation, in, high, level, play, the, 4, 2, formation, has, four, hitters, and, two, setters, the, setters, usually, set, from, the, middle, front, or, right, front, position, the, team, will, therefore, have, two, front, row, attackers, at, all, times, in, the, international, 4, 2, the, setters, set, from, the, right, front, position, the, international, 4, 2, translates, more, easily, into, other, forms, of, offence, the, setters, line, up, opposite, each, other, in, the, rotation, the, typical, lineup, has, two, outside, hitters, by, aligning, like, positions, opposite, themselves, in, the, rotation, there, will, always, be, one, of, each, position, in, the, front, and, back, rows, after, service, the, players, in, the, front, row, move, into, their, assigned, positions, so, that, the, setter, is, always, in, the, middle, front, alternatively, the, setter, moves, into, the, right, front, and, has, both, a, middle, and, an, outside, attacker, the, disadvantage, here, lies, in, the, lack, of, an, offside, hitter, allowing, one, of, the, other, team, s, blockers, to, cheat, in, on, a, middle, block, the, clear, disadvantage, with, this, offensive, formation, is, that, there, are, only, two, attackers, leaving, a, team, with, fewer, offensive, weapons, another, aspect, is, to, see, the, setter, as, an, attacking, force, albeit, a, weakened, force, because, when, the, setter, is, in, the, frontcourt, they, are, able, to, tip, or, dump, so, when, the, ball, is, close, to, the, net, on, the, second, touch, the, setter, may, opt, to, hit, the, ball, over, with, one, hand, this, means, that, the, blocker, who, would, otherwise, not, have, to, block, the, setter, is, engaged, and, may, allow, one, of, the, hitters, to, have, an, easier, attack, in, the, 6, 2, formation, a, player, always, comes, forward, from, the, back, row, to, set, the, three, front, row, players, are, all, in, attacking, positions, as, a, result, all, six, players, act, as, hitters, at, one, time, or, another, while, two, can, act, as, setters, so, the, 6, 2, formation, is, actually, a, 4, 2, system, but, the, back, row, setter, penetrates, to, set, the, 6, 2, lineup, thus, requires, two, setters, who, line, up, opposite, to, each, other, in, the, rotation, in, addition, to, the, setters, a, typical, lineup, will, have, two, middle, hitters, and, two, outside, hitters, by, aligning, like, positions, opposite, themselves, in, the, rotation, there, will, always, be, one, of, each, position, in, the, front, and, back, rows, after, service, the, players, in, the, front, row, move, into, their, assigned, positions, the, advantage, of, the, 6, 2, is, that, there, are, always, three, front, row, hitters, available, maximizing, the, offensive, possibilities, however, not, only, does, the, 6, 2, require, a, team, to, possess, two, people, capable, of, performing, the, highly, specialized, role, of, setter, it, also, requires, both, of, those, players, to, be, effective, offensive, hitters, when, not, in, the, setter, position, at, the, international, level, only, the, cuban, national, women, s, team, employs, this, kind, of, formation, it, is, also, used, by, ncaa, teams, in, division, iii, men, s, play, and, women, s, play, in, all, divisions, partially, due, to, the, variant, rules, used, which, allow, more, substitutions, per, set, than, the, 6, allowed, in, the, standard, rules, 12, in, matches, involving, two, division, iii, men, s, teams, and, 15, for, all, women, s, play, the, 5, 1, formation, has, only, one, player, who, assumes, setting, responsibilities, regardless, of, their, position, in, the, rotation, the, team, will, therefore, have, three, front, row, attackers, when, the, setter, is, in, the, back, row, and, only, two, when, the, setter, is, in, the, front, row, for, a, total, of, five, possible, attackers, in, this, formation, the, libero, will, replace, a, middle, blocker, in, the, back, row, the, player, opposite, the, setter, in, a, 5, 1, rotation, is, called, the, opposite, hitter, in, general, opposite, hitters, do, not, pass, they, stand, behind, their, teammates, when, the, opponent, is, serving, the, opposite, hitter, may, be, used, as, a, third, attack, option, back, row, attack, when, the, setter, is, in, the, front, row, this, is, the, normal, option, used, to, increase, the, attack, capabilities, of, modern, volleyball, teams, normally, the, opposite, hitter, is, the, most, technically, skilled, hitter, of, the, team, back, row, attacks, generally, come, from, the, back, right, position, known, as, zone, 1, but, are, increasingly, performed, from, back, centre, in, high, level, play, the, big, advantage, of, the, system, is, that, the, setter, always, has, 3, hitters, with, which, to, vary, sets, if, the, setter, performs, well, the, opponent, s, middle, blocker, may, not, have, enough, time, to, block, with, the, outside, blocker, increasing, the, chance, for, the, attacking, team, to, make, a, point, there, is, another, advantage, the, same, as, that, of, a, 4, 2, formation, as, a, front, row, player, the, setter, is, allowed, to, jump, and, dump, the, ball, onto, the, opponent, s, side, thus, the, setter, can, confuse, the, opponent, s, blocking, players, they, have, the, option, to, jump, and, dump, or, set, to, one, of, the, hitters, a, good, setter, knows, and, they, are, able, to, jump, to, dump, or, to, set, for, a, quick, hit, as, well, as, when, setting, outside, thus, they, are, able, to, confuse, the, opponent, the, 5, 1, offence, is, actually, a, mix, of, 6, 2, and, 4, 2, when, the, setter, is, in, the, front, row, the, offense, looks, like, a, 4, 2, when, the, setter, is, in, the, back, row, the, offense, looks, like, a, 6, 2, there, are, many, variations, on, the, basic, rules, of, volleyball, by, far, the, most, popular, of, these, is, beach, volleyball, which, is, played, on, sand, with, two, people, per, team, and, rivals, the, main, sport, in, popularity, some, games, related, to, volleyball, include
