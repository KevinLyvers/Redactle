religious, marriage, is, known, variously, as, sacramental, marriage, in, christianity, especially, catholicism, nikah, in, islam, nissuin, in, judaism, and, various, other, names, in, other, faith, traditions, each, with, their, own, constraints, as, to, what, constitutes, and, who, can, enter, into, a, valid, religious, marriage, the, word, marriage, appeared, around, 1300, and, is, borrowed, from, old, french, mariage, 12th, century, itself, descended, from, vulgar, latin, marit, ticum, 11th, century, ultimately, tracing, to, the, latin, marit, tus, married, past, participle, of, marit, re, to, marry, the, adjective, mar, tus, a, um, matrimonial, nuptial, could, also, be, used, through, nominalization, in, the, masculine, form, as, a, noun, for, husband, and, in, the, feminine, form, for, wife, the, related, word, matrimony, is, borrowed, from, the, old, french, word, matremoine, which, appears, around, 1300, ce, and, is, in, turn, ultimately, a, learned, borrowing, from, latin, m, trim, nium, which, is, derived, from, m, ter, mother, with, the, suffix, m, nium, for, an, action, state, or, condition, anthropologists, have, proposed, several, competing, definitions, of, marriage, in, an, attempt, to, encompass, the, wide, variety, of, marital, practices, observed, across, cultures, even, within, western, culture, definitions, of, marriage, have, careened, from, one, extreme, to, another, and, everywhere, in, between, as, evan, gerstmann, has, put, it, in, the, history, of, human, marriage, 1891, edvard, westermarck, defined, marriage, as, a, more, or, less, durable, connection, between, male, and, female, lasting, beyond, the, mere, act, of, propagation, till, after, the, birth, of, the, offspring, in, the, future, of, marriage, in, western, civilization, 1936, he, rejected, his, earlier, definition, instead, provisionally, defining, marriage, as, a, relation, of, one, or, more, men, to, one, or, more, women, that, is, recognized, by, custom, or, law, the, anthropological, handbook, notes, and, queries, 1951, defined, marriage, as, a, union, between, a, man, and, a, woman, such, that, children, born, to, the, woman, are, the, recognized, legitimate, offspring, of, both, partners, in, recognition, of, a, practice, by, the, nuer, people, of, sudan, allowing, women, to, act, as, a, husband, in, certain, circumstances, the, ghost, marriage, kathleen, gough, suggested, modifying, this, to, a, woman, and, one, or, more, other, persons, in, an, analysis, of, marriage, among, the, nayar, a, polyandrous, society, in, india, gough, found, that, the, group, lacked, a, husband, role, in, the, conventional, sense, the, husband, role, unitary, in, the, west, was, instead, divided, between, a, non, resident, social, father, of, the, woman, s, children, and, her, lovers, who, were, the, actual, procreators, none, of, these, men, had, legal, rights, to, the, woman, s, child, this, forced, gough, to, disregard, sexual, access, as, a, key, element, of, marriage, and, to, define, it, in, terms, of, legitimacy, of, offspring, alone, marriage, is, a, relationship, established, between, a, woman, and, one, or, more, other, persons, which, provides, a, child, born, to, the, woman, under, circumstances, not, prohibited, by, the, rules, of, relationship, is, accorded, full, birth, status, rights, common, to, normal, members, of, his, society, or, social, stratum, economic, anthropologist, duran, bell, has, criticized, the, legitimacy, based, definition, on, the, basis, that, some, societies, do, not, require, marriage, for, legitimacy, he, argued, that, a, legitimacy, based, definition, of, marriage, is, circular, in, societies, where, illegitimacy, has, no, other, legal, or, social, implications, for, a, child, other, than, the, mother, being, unmarried, edmund, leach, criticized, gough, s, definition, for, being, too, restrictive, in, terms, of, recognized, legitimate, offspring, and, suggested, that, marriage, be, viewed, in, terms, of, the, different, types, of, rights, it, serves, to, establish, in, a, 1955, article, in, man, leach, argued, that, no, one, definition, of, marriage, applied, to, all, cultures, he, offered, a, list, of, ten, rights, associated, with, marriage, including, sexual, monopoly, and, rights, with, respect, to, children, with, specific, rights, differing, across, cultures, those, rights, according, to, leach, included, in, a, 1997, article, in, current, anthropology, duran, bell, describes, marriage, as, a, relationship, between, one, or, more, men, male, or, female, in, severalty, to, one, or, more, women, that, provides, those, men, with, a, demand, right, of, sexual, access, within, a, domestic, group, and, identifies, women, who, bear, the, obligation, of, yielding, to, the, demands, of, those, specific, men, in, referring, to, men, in, severalty, bell, is, referring, to, corporate, kin, groups, such, as, lineages, which, in, having, paid, bride, price, retain, a, right, in, a, woman, s, offspring, even, if, her, husband, a, lineage, member, deceases, levirate, marriage, in, referring, to, men, male, or, female, bell, is, referring, to, women, within, the, lineage, who, may, stand, in, as, the, social, fathers, of, the, wife, s, children, born, of, other, lovers, see, nuer, ghost, marriage, monogamy, is, a, form, of, marriage, in, which, an, individual, has, only, one, spouse, during, their, lifetime, or, at, any, one, time, serial, monogamy, anthropologist, jack, goody, s, comparative, study, of, marriage, around, the, world, utilizing, the, ethnographic, atlas, found, a, strong, correlation, between, intensive, plough, agriculture, dowry, and, monogamy, this, pattern, was, found, in, a, broad, swath, of, eurasian, societies, from, japan, to, ireland, the, majority, of, sub, saharan, african, societies, that, practice, extensive, hoe, agriculture, in, contrast, show, a, correlation, between, bride, price, and, polygamy, a, further, study, drawing, on, the, ethnographic, atlas, showed, a, statistical, correlation, between, increasing, size, of, the, society, the, belief, in, high, gods, to, support, human, morality, and, monogamy, in, the, countries, which, do, not, permit, polygamy, a, person, who, marries, in, one, of, those, countries, a, person, while, still, being, lawfully, married, to, another, commits, the, crime, of, bigamy, in, all, cases, the, second, marriage, is, considered, legally, null, and, void, besides, the, second, and, subsequent, marriages, being, void, the, bigamist, is, also, liable, to, other, penalties, which, also, vary, between, jurisdictions, governments, that, support, monogamy, may, allow, easy, divorce, in, a, number, of, western, countries, divorce, rates, approach, 50, those, who, remarry, do, so, usually, no, more, than, three, times, divorce, and, remarriage, can, thus, result, in, serial, monogamy, i, e, having, multiple, marriages, but, only, one, legal, spouse, at, a, time, this, can, be, interpreted, as, a, form, of, plural, mating, as, are, those, societies, dominated, by, female, headed, families, in, the, caribbean, mauritius, and, brazil, where, there, is, frequent, rotation, of, unmarried, partners, in, all, these, account, for, 16, to, 24, of, the, monogamous, category, serial, monogamy, creates, a, new, kind, of, relative, the, ex, the, ex, wife, for, example, may, remain, an, active, part, of, her, ex, husband, s, or, ex, wife, s, life, as, they, may, be, tied, together, by, transfers, of, resources, alimony, child, support, or, shared, child, custody, bob, simpson, notes, that, in, the, british, case, serial, monogamy, creates, an, extended, family, a, number, of, households, tied, together, in, this, way, including, mobile, children, possible, exes, may, include, an, ex, wife, an, ex, brother, in, law, etc, but, not, an, ex, child, these, unclear, families, do, not, fit, the, mould, of, the, monogamous, nuclear, family, as, a, series, of, connected, households, they, come, to, resemble, the, polygynous, model, of, separate, households, maintained, by, mothers, with, children, tied, by, a, male, to, whom, they, are, married, or, divorced, polygamy, is, a, marriage, which, includes, more, than, two, spouses, when, a, man, is, married, to, more, than, one, wife, at, a, time, the, relationship, is, called, polygyny, and, there, is, no, marriage, bond, between, the, wives, and, when, a, woman, is, married, to, more, than, one, husband, at, a, time, it, is, called, polyandry, and, there, is, no, marriage, bond, between, the, husbands, if, a, marriage, includes, multiple, husbands, or, wives, it, can, be, called, group, marriage, a, molecular, genetic, study, of, global, human, genetic, diversity, argued, that, sexual, polygyny, was, typical, of, human, reproductive, patterns, until, the, shift, to, sedentary, farming, communities, approximately, 10, 000, to, 5, 000, years, ago, in, europe, and, asia, and, more, recently, in, africa, and, the, americas, as, noted, above, anthropologist, jack, goody, s, comparative, study, of, marriage, around, the, world, utilizing, the, ethnographic, atlas, found, that, the, majority, of, sub, saharan, african, societies, that, practice, extensive, hoe, agriculture, show, a, correlation, between, bride, price, and, polygamy, a, survey, of, other, cross, cultural, samples, has, confirmed, that, the, absence, of, the, plough, was, the, only, predictor, of, polygamy, although, other, factors, such, as, high, male, mortality, in, warfare, in, non, state, societies, and, pathogen, stress, in, state, societies, had, some, impact, marriages, are, classified, according, to, the, number, of, legal, spouses, an, individual, has, the, suffix, gamy, refers, specifically, to, the, number, of, spouses, as, in, bi, gamy, two, spouses, generally, illegal, in, most, nations, and, poly, gamy, more, than, one, spouse, societies, show, variable, acceptance, of, polygamy, as, a, cultural, ideal, and, practice, according, to, the, ethnographic, atlas, of, 1, 231, societies, noted, 186, were, monogamous, 453, had, occasional, polygyny, 588, had, more, frequent, polygyny, and, 4, had, polyandry, however, as, miriam, zeitzen, writes, social, tolerance, for, polygamy, is, different, from, the, practice, of, polygamy, since, it, requires, wealth, to, establish, multiple, households, for, multiple, wives, the, actual, practice, of, polygamy, in, a, tolerant, society, may, actually, be, low, with, the, majority, of, aspirant, polygamists, practicing, monogamous, marriage, tracking, the, occurrence, of, polygamy, is, further, complicated, in, jurisdictions, where, it, has, been, banned, but, continues, to, be, practiced, de, facto, polygamy, zeitzen, also, notes, that, western, perceptions, of, african, society, and, marriage, patterns, are, biased, by, contradictory, concerns, of, nostalgia, for, traditional, african, culture, versus, critique, of, polygamy, as, oppressive, to, women, or, detrimental, to, development, polygamy, has, been, condemned, as, being, a, form, of, human, rights, abuse, with, concerns, arising, over, domestic, abuse, forced, marriage, and, neglect, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, countries, including, virtually, all, of, the, world, s, developed, nations, do, not, permit, polygamy, there, have, been, calls, for, the, abolition, of, polygamy, in, developing, countries, polygyny, usually, grants, wives, equal, status, although, the, husband, may, have, personal, preferences, one, type, of, de, facto, polygyny, is, concubinage, where, only, one, woman, gets, a, wife, s, rights, and, status, while, other, women, remain, legal, house, mistresses, although, a, society, may, be, classified, as, polygynous, not, all, marriages, in, it, necessarily, are, monogamous, marriages, may, in, fact, predominate, it, is, to, this, flexibility, that, anthropologist, robin, fox, attributes, its, success, as, a, social, support, system, this, has, often, meant, given, the, imbalance, in, the, sex, ratios, the, higher, male, infant, mortality, the, shorter, life, span, of, males, the, loss, of, males, in, wartime, etc, that, often, women, were, left, without, financial, support, from, husbands, to, correct, this, condition, females, had, to, be, killed, at, birth, remain, single, become, prostitutes, or, be, siphoned, off, into, celibate, religious, orders, polygynous, systems, have, the, advantage, that, they, can, promise, as, did, the, mormons, a, home, and, family, for, every, woman, nonetheless, polygyny, is, a, gender, issue, which, offers, men, asymmetrical, benefits, in, some, cases, there, is, a, large, age, discrepancy, as, much, as, a, generation, between, a, man, and, his, youngest, wife, compounding, the, power, differential, between, the, two, tensions, not, only, exist, between, genders, but, also, within, genders, senior, and, junior, men, compete, for, wives, and, senior, and, junior, wives, in, the, same, household, may, experience, radically, different, life, conditions, and, internal, hierarchy, several, studies, have, suggested, that, the, wive, s, relationship, with, other, women, including, co, wives, and, husband, s, female, kin, are, more, critical, relationships, than, that, with, her, husband, for, her, productive, reproductive, and, personal, achievement, in, some, societies, the, co, wives, are, relatives, usually, sisters, a, practice, called, sororal, polygyny, the, pre, existing, relationship, between, the, co, wives, is, thought, to, decrease, potential, tensions, within, the, marriage, fox, argues, that, the, major, difference, between, polygyny, and, monogamy, could, be, stated, thus, while, plural, mating, occurs, in, both, systems, under, polygyny, several, unions, may, be, recognized, as, being, legal, marriages, while, under, monogamy, only, one, of, the, unions, is, so, recognized, often, however, it, is, difficult, to, draw, a, hard, and, fast, line, between, the, two, as, polygamy, in, africa, is, increasingly, subject, to, legal, limitations, a, variant, form, of, de, facto, as, opposed, to, legal, or, de, jure, polygyny, is, being, practiced, in, urban, centers, although, it, does, not, involve, multiple, now, illegal, formal, marriages, the, domestic, and, personal, arrangements, follow, old, polygynous, patterns, the, de, facto, form, of, polygyny, is, found, in, other, parts, of, the, world, as, well, including, some, mormon, sects, and, muslim, families, in, the, united, states, in, some, societies, such, as, the, lovedu, of, south, africa, or, the, nuer, of, the, sudan, aristocratic, women, may, become, female, husbands, in, the, lovedu, case, this, female, husband, may, take, a, number, of, polygamous, wives, this, is, not, a, lesbian, relationship, but, a, means, of, legitimately, expanding, a, royal, lineage, by, attaching, these, wives, children, to, it, the, relationships, are, considered, polygynous, not, polyandrous, because, the, female, husband, is, in, fact, assuming, masculine, gendered, political, roles, religious, groups, have, differing, views, on, the, legitimacy, of, polygyny, it, is, allowed, in, islam, and, confucianism, judaism, and, christianity, have, mentioned, practices, involving, polygyny, in, the, past, however, outright, religious, acceptance, of, such, practices, was, not, addressed, until, its, rejection, in, later, passages, they, do, explicitly, prohibit, polygyny, today, polyandry, is, notably, more, rare, than, polygyny, though, less, rare, than, the, figure, commonly, cited, in, the, ethnographic, atlas, 1980, which, listed, only, those, polyandrous, societies, found, in, the, himalayan, mountains, more, recent, studies, have, found, 53, societies, outside, the, 28, found, in, the, himalayans, which, practice, polyandry, it, is, most, common, in, egalitarian, societies, marked, by, high, male, mortality, or, male, absenteeism, it, is, associated, with, partible, paternity, the, cultural, belief, that, a, child, can, have, more, than, one, father, the, explanation, for, polyandry, in, the, himalayan, mountains, is, related, to, the, scarcity, of, land, the, marriage, of, all, brothers, in, a, family, to, the, same, wife, fraternal, polyandry, allows, family, land, to, remain, intact, and, undivided, if, every, brother, married, separately, and, had, children, family, land, would, be, split, into, unsustainable, small, plots, in, europe, this, was, prevented, through, the, social, practice, of, impartible, inheritance, the, dis, inheriting, of, most, siblings, some, of, whom, went, on, to, become, celibate, monks, and, priests, group, marriage, also, known, as, multi, lateral, marriage, is, a, form, of, polyamory, in, which, more, than, two, persons, form, a, family, unit, with, all, the, members, of, the, group, marriage, being, considered, to, be, married, to, all, the, other, members, of, the, group, marriage, and, all, members, of, the, marriage, share, parental, responsibility, for, any, children, arising, from, the, marriage, no, country, legally, condones, group, marriages, neither, under, the, law, nor, as, a, common, law, marriage, but, historically, it, has, been, practiced, by, some, cultures, of, polynesia, asia, papua, new, guinea, and, the, americas, as, well, as, in, some, intentional, communities, and, alternative, subcultures, such, as, the, oneida, perfectionists, in, up, state, new, york, of, the, 250, societies, reported, by, the, american, anthropologist, george, murdock, in, 1949, only, the, kaingang, of, brazil, had, any, group, marriages, at, all, a, child, marriage, is, a, marriage, where, one, or, both, spouses, are, under, the, age, of, 18, it, is, related, to, child, betrothal, and, teenage, pregnancy, child, marriage, was, common, throughout, history, even, up, until, the, 1900s, in, the, united, states, where, in, 1880, ce, in, the, state, of, delaware, the, age, of, consent, for, marriage, was, 7, years, old, still, in, 2017, over, half, of, the, 50, united, states, have, no, explicit, minimum, age, to, marry, and, several, states, set, the, age, as, low, as, 14, today, it, is, condemned, by, international, human, rights, organizations, child, marriages, are, often, arranged, between, the, families, of, the, future, bride, and, groom, sometimes, as, soon, as, the, girl, is, born, however, in, the, late, 1800s, in, england, and, the, united, states, feminist, activists, began, calling, for, raised, age, of, consent, laws, which, was, eventually, handled, in, the, 1920s, having, been, raised, to, 16, 18, child, marriages, can, also, occur, in, the, context, of, bride, kidnapping, in, the, year, 1552, ce, john, somerford, and, jane, somerford, brereton, were, both, married, at, the, ages, of, 3, and, 2, respectively, twelve, years, later, in, 1564, john, filed, for, divorce, while, child, marriage, is, observed, for, both, boys, and, girls, the, overwhelming, majority, of, child, spouses, are, girls, in, many, cases, only, one, marriage, partner, is, a, child, usually, the, female, due, to, the, importance, placed, upon, female, virginity, causes, of, child, marriage, include, poverty, bride, price, dowry, laws, that, allow, child, marriages, religious, and, social, pressures, regional, customs, fear, of, remaining, unmarried, and, perceived, inability, of, women, to, work, for, money, today, child, marriages, are, widespread, in, parts, of, the, world, being, most, common, in, south, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, with, more, than, half, of, the, girls, in, some, countries, in, those, regions, being, married, before, 18, the, incidence, of, child, marriage, has, been, falling, in, most, parts, of, the, world, in, developed, countries, child, marriage, is, outlawed, or, restricted, girls, who, marry, before, 18, are, at, greater, risk, of, becoming, victims, of, domestic, violence, than, those, who, marry, later, especially, when, they, are, married, to, a, much, older, man, several, kinds, of, same, sex, marriages, have, been, documented, in, indigenous, and, lineage, based, cultures, in, the, americas, we, wha, zuni, was, a, lhamana, male, individuals, who, at, least, some, of, the, time, dress, and, live, in,

recognition, as, commonly, granted, to, mixed, sex, couples, there, is, some, history, of, recorded, same, sex, unions, around, the, world, ancient, greek, same, sex, relationships, were, like, modern, companionate, marriages, unlike, their, different, sex, marriages, in, which, the, spouses, had, few, emotional, ties, and, the, husband, had, freedom, to, engage, in, outside, sexual, liaisons, the, codex, theodosianus, c, th, 9, 7, 3, issued, in, 438, ce, imposed, severe, penalties, or, death, on, same, sex, relationships, but, the, exact, intent, of, the, law, and, its, relation, to, social, practice, is, unclear, as, only, a, few, examples, of, same, sex, relationships, in, that, culture, exist, same, sex, unions, were, celebrated, in, some, regions, of, china, such, as, fujian, possibly, the, earliest, documented, same, sex, wedding, in, latin, christendom, occurred, in, rome, italy, at, the, san, giovanni, a, porta, latina, basilica, in, 1581, several, cultures, have, practised, temporary, and, conditional, marriages, examples, include, the, celtic, practice, of, handfasting, and, fixed, term, marriages, in, the, muslim, community, pre, islamic, arabs, practiced, a, form, of, temporary, marriage, that, carries, on, today, in, the, practice, of, nikah, mut, ah, a, fixed, term, marriage, contract, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, sanctioned, a, temporary, marriage, sigheh, in, iran, and, muta, a, in, iraq, which, can, provide, a, legitimizing, cover, for, sex, workers, the, same, forms, of, temporary, marriage, have, been, used, in, egypt, lebanon, and, iran, to, make, the, donation, of, a, human, ova, legal, for, in, vitro, fertilisation, a, woman, cannot, however, use, this, kind, of, marriage, to, obtain, a, sperm, donation, muslim, controversies, related, to, nikah, mut, ah, have, resulted, in, the, practice, being, confined, mostly, to, shi, ite, communities, the, matrilineal, mosuo, of, china, practice, what, they, call, walking, marriage, in, some, jurisdictions, cohabitation, in, certain, circumstances, may, constitute, a, common, law, marriage, an, unregistered, partnership, or, otherwise, provide, the, unmarried, partners, with, various, rights, and, responsibilities, and, in, some, countries, the, laws, recognize, cohabitation, in, lieu, of, institutional, marriage, for, taxation, and, social, security, benefits, this, is, the, case, for, example, in, australia, cohabitation, may, be, an, option, pursued, as, a, form, of, resistance, to, traditional, institutionalized, marriage, however, in, this, context, some, nations, reserve, the, right, to, define, the, relationship, as, marital, or, otherwise, to, regulate, the, relation, even, if, the, relation, has, not, been, registered, with, the, state, or, a, religious, institution, conversely, institutionalized, marriages, may, not, involve, cohabitation, in, some, cases, couples, living, together, do, not, wish, to, be, recognized, as,

malaysia, and, russia, in, various, societies, the, choice, of, partner, is, often, limited, to, suitable, persons, from, specific, social, groups, in, some, societies, the, rule, is, that, a, partner, is, selected, from, an, individual, s, own, social, group, endogamy, this, is, often, the, case, in, class, and, caste, based, societies, but, in, other, societies, a, partner, must, be, chosen, from, a, different, group, than, one, s, own, exogamy, this, may, be, the, case, in, societies, practicing, totemic, religion, where, society, is, divided, into, several, exogamous, totemic, clans, such, as, most, aboriginal, australian, societies, in, other, societies, a, person, is, expected, to, marry, their, cross, cousin, a, woman, must, marry, her, father, s, sister, s, son, and, a, man, must, marry, his, mother, s, brother, s, daughter, this, is, often, the, case, if, either, a, society, has, a, rule, of, tracing, kinship, exclusively, through, patrilineal, or, matrilineal, descent, groups, as, among, the, akan, people, of, west, africa, another, kind, of, marriage, selection, is, the, levirate, marriage, in, which, widows, are, obligated, to, marry, their, husband, s,

based, societies, with, a, classificatory, kinship, system, potential, spouses, are, sought, from, a, specific, class, of, relative, as, determined, by, a, prescriptive, marriage, rule, this, rule, may, be, expressed, by, anthropologists, using, a, descriptive, kinship, term, such, as, a, man, s, mother, s, brother, s, daughter, also, known, as, a, cross, cousin, such, descriptive, rules, mask, the, participant, s, perspective, a, man, should, marry, a, woman, from, his, mother, s, lineage, within, the, society, s, kinship, terminology, such, relatives, are, usually, indicated, by, a, specific, term, which, sets, them, apart, as, potentially, marriageable, pierre, bourdieu, notes, however, that, very, few, marriages, ever, follow, the, rule, and, that, when, they, do, so, it, is, for, practical, kinship, reasons, such, as, the, preservation, of, family, property, rather, than, the, official, kinship, ideology, insofar, as, regular, marriages, following, prescriptive, rules,

parties, is, married, against, their, will, forced, marriages, continue, to, be, practiced, in, parts, of, the, world, especially, in, south, asia, and, africa, the, line, between, forced, marriage, and, consensual, marriage, may, become, blurred, because, the, social, norms, of, these, cultures, dictate, that, one, should, never, oppose, the, desire, of, one, s, parents, relatives, in, regard, to, the, choice, of, a, spouse, in, such, cultures, it, is, not, necessary, for, violence, threats, intimidation, etc, to, occur, the, person, simply, consents, to, the, marriage, even, if, they, do, not, want, it, out, of, the, implied, social, pressure, and, duty, the, customs, of, bride, price, and, dowry, that, exist, in, parts, of, the, world, can, lead, to, buying, and, selling, people, into, marriage, in, some, societies, ranging, from, central, asia, to, the, caucasus, to, africa, the, custom, of, bride, kidnapping, still, exists, in, which, a, woman, is, captured, by, a, man, and, his, friends, sometimes, this, covers, an, elopement, but, sometimes, it, depends, on, sexual, violence, in, previous, times, raptio, was, a, larger, scale, version, of, this, with, groups, of, women, captured, by, groups, of, men, sometimes, in, war, the, most, famous, example, is, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, which, provided, the, first, citizens, of, rome, with, their, wives, other, marriage, partners, are, more, or, less, imposed, on, an, individual, for, example, widow, inheritance, provides, a, widow, with, another, man, from, her, late, husband, s, brothers, in, rural, areas, of, india, child, marriage, is, practiced, with, parents, often, arranging, the, wedding, sometimes, even, before, the, child, is, born, this, practice, was, made, illegal, under, the, child, marriage, restraint, act, of, 1929, the, financial, aspects, of, marriage, vary, between, cultures, and, have, changed, over, time, in, some, cultures, dowries, and, bride, wealth, continue, to, be, required, today, in, both, cases, the, financial, arrangements, are, usually, made, between, the, groom, or, his, family, and, the, bride, s, family, with, the, bride, often, not, being, involved, in, the, negotiations, and, often, not, having, a, choice, in, whether, to, participate, in, the, marriage, in, early, modern, britain, the, social, status, of, the, couple, was, supposed, to, be, equal, after, the, marriage, all, the, property, called, fortune, and, expected, inheritances, of, the, wife, belonged, to, the, husband, a, dowry, is, a, process, whereby, parental, property, is, distributed, to, a, daughter, at, her, marriage, i, e, inter, vivos, rather, than, at, the, holder, s, death, mortis, causa, a, dowry, establishes, some, variety, of, conjugal, fund, the, nature, of, which, may, vary, widely, this, fund, ensures, her, support, or, endowment, in, widowhood, and, eventually, goes, to, provide, for, her, sons, and, daughters, in, some, cultures, especially, in, countries, such, as, turkey, india, bangladesh, pakistan, sri, lanka, morocco, nepal, dowries, continue, to, be, expected, in, india, thousands, of, dowry, related, deaths, have, taken, place, on, yearly, basis, to, counter, this, problem, several, jurisdictions, have, enacted, laws, restricting, or, banning, dowry, see, dowry, law, in, india, in, nepal, dowry, was, made, illegal, in, 2009, some, authors, believe, that, the, giving, and, receiving, of, dowry, reflects, the, status, and, even, the, effort, to, climb, high, in, social, hierarchy, direct, dowry, contrasts, with, bride, wealth, which, is, paid, by, the, groom, or, his, family, to, the, bride, s, parents, and, with, indirect, dowry, or, dower, which, is, property, given, to, the, bride, herself, by, the, groom, at, the, time, of, marriage, and, which, remains, under, her, ownership, and, control, in, the, jewish, tradition, the, rabbis, in, ancient, times, insisted, on, the, marriage, couple, entering, into, a, prenuptial, agreement, called, a, ketubah, besides, other, things, the, ketubah, provided, for, an, amount, to, be, paid, by, the, husband, in, the, event, of, a, divorce, or, his, estate, in, the, event, of, his, death, this, amount, was, a, replacement, of, the, biblical, dower, or, bride, price, which, was, payable, at, the, time, of, the, marriage, by, the, groom, to, the, father, of, the, bride, this, innovation, was, put, in, place, because, the, biblical, bride, price, created, a, major, social, problem, many, young, prospective, husbands, could, not, raise, the, bride, price, at, the, time, when, they, would, normally, be, expected, to, marry, so, to, enable, these, young, men, to, marry, the, rabbis, in, effect, delayed, the, time, that, the, amount, would, be, payable, when, they, would, be, more, likely, to, have, the, sum, it, may, also, be, noted, that, both, the, dower, and, the, ketubah, amounts, served, the, same, purpose, the, protection, for, the, wife, should, her, support, cease, either, by, death, or, divorce, the, only, difference, between, the, two, systems, was, the, timing, of, the, payment, it, is, the, predecessor, to, the, wife, s, present, day, entitlement, to, maintenance, in, the, event, of, the, breakup, of, marriage, and, family, maintenance, in, the, event, of, the, husband, not, providing, adequately, for, the, wife, in, his, will, another, function, performed, by, the, ketubah, amount, was, to, provide, a, disincentive, for, the, husband, contemplating, divorcing, his, wife, he, would, need, to, have, the, amount, to, be, able, to, pay, to, the, wife, morning, gifts, which, might, also, be, arranged, by, the, bride, s, father, rather, than, the, bride, are, given, to, the, bride, herself, the, name, derives, from, the, germanic, tribal, custom, of, giving, them, the, morning, after, the, wedding, night, she, might, have, control, of, this, morning, gift, during, the, lifetime, of, her, husband, but, is, entitled, to, it, when, widowed, if, the, amount, of, her, inheritance, is, settled, by, law, rather, than, agreement, it, may, be, called, dower, depending, on, legal, systems, and, the, exact, arrangement, she, may, not, be, entitled, to, dispose, of, it, after, her, death, and, may, lose, the, property, if, she, remarries, morning, gifts, were, preserved, for, centuries, in, morganatic, marriage, a, union, where, the, wife, s, inferior, social, status, was, held, to, prohibit, her, children, from, inheriting, a, noble, s, titles, or, estates, in, this, case, the, morning, gift, would, support, the, wife, and, children, another, legal, provision, for, widowhood, was, jointure, in, which, property, often, land, would, be, held, in, joint, tenancy, so, that, it, would, automatically, go, to, the, widow, on, her, husband, s, death, islamic, tradition, has, similar, practices, a, mahr, either, immediate, or, deferred, is, the, woman, s, portion, of, the, groom, s, wealth, divorce, or, estate, death, these, amounts, are, usually, set, on, the, basis, of, the, groom, s, own, and, family, wealth, and, incomes, but, in, some, parts, these, are, set, very, high, so, as, to, provide, a, disincentive, for, the, groom, exercising, the, divorce, or, the, husband, s, family, inheriting, a, large, portion, of, the, estate, especially, if, there, are, no, male, offspring, from, the, marriage, in, some, countries, including, iran, the, mahr, or, alimony, can, amount, to, more, than, a, man, can, ever, hope, to, earn, sometimes, up, to, us, 1, 000, 000, 4000, official, iranian, gold, coins, if, the, husband, cannot, pay, the, mahr, either, in, case, of, a, divorce, or, on, demand, according, to, the, current, laws, in, iran, he, will, have, to, pay, it, by, installments, failure, to, pay, the, mahr, might, even, lead, to, imprisonment, bridewealth, is, a, common, practice, in, parts, of, southeast, asia, thailand, cambodia, parts, of, central, asia, and, in, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, it, is, also, known, as, brideprice, although, this, has, fallen, in, disfavor, as, it, implies, the, purchase, of, the, bride, bridewealth, is, the, amount, of, money, or, property, or, wealth, paid, by, the, groom, or, his, family, to, the, parents, of, a, woman, upon, the, marriage, of, their, daughter, to, the, groom, in, anthropological, literature, bride, price, has, often, been, explained, as, payment, made, to, compensate, the, bride, s, family, for, the, loss, of, her, labor, and, fertility, in, some, cases, bridewealth, is, a, means, by, which, the, groom, s, family, s, ties, to, the, children, of, the, union, are, recognized, in, some, countries, a, married, person, or, couple, benefits, from, various, taxation, advantages, not, available, to, a, single, person, for, example, spouses, may, be, allowed, to, average, their, combined, incomes, this, is, advantageous, to, a, married, couple, with, disparate, incomes, to, compensate, for, this, countries, may, provide, a, higher, tax, bracket, for, the, averaged, income, of, a, married, couple, while, income, averaging, might, still, benefit, a, married, couple, with, a, stay, at, home, spouse, such, averaging, would, cause, a, married, couple, with, roughly, equal, personal, incomes, to, pay, more, total, tax, than, they, would, as, two, single, persons, in, the, united, states, this, is, called, the, marriage, penalty, when, the, rates, applied, by, the, tax, code, are, not, based, income, averaging, but, rather, on, the, sum, of, individuals, incomes, higher, rates, will, usually, apply, to, each, individual, in, a, two, earner, households, in, a, progressive, tax, systems, this, is, most, often, the, case, with, high, income, taxpayers, and, is, another, situation, called, a, marriage, penalty, conversely, when, progressive, tax, is, levied, on, the, individual, with, no, consideration, for, the, partnership, dual, income, couples, fare, much, better, than, single, income, couples, with, similar, household, incomes, the, effect, can, be, increased, when, the, welfare, system, treats, the, same, income, as, a, shared, income, thereby, denying, welfare, access, to, the, non, earning, spouse, such, systems, apply, in, australia, and, canada, for, example, in, many, western, cultures, marriage, usually, leads, to, the, formation, of, a, new, household, comprising, the, married, couple, with, the, married, couple, living, together, in, the, same, home, often, sharing, the, same, bed, but, in, some, other, cultures, this, is, not, the, tradition, among, the, minangkabau, of, west, sumatra, residency, after, marriage, is, matrilocal, with, the, husband, moving, into, the, household, of, his, wife, s, mother, residency, after, marriage, can, also, be, patrilocal, or, avunculocal, in, these, cases, married, couples, may, not, form, an, independent, household, but, remain, part, of, an, extended, family, household, early, theories, explaining, the, determinants, of, postmarital, residence, connected, it, with, the, sexual, division, of, labor, however, to, date, cross, cultural, tests, of, this, hypothesis, using, worldwide, samples, have, failed, to, find, any, significant, relationship, between, these, two, variables, however, korotayev, s, tests, show, that, the, female, contribution, to, subsistence, does, correlate, significantly, with, matrilocal, residence, in, general, however, this, correlation, is, masked, by, a, general, polygyny, factor, although, in, different, sex, marriages, an, increase, in, the, female, contribution, to, subsistence, tends, to, lead, to, matrilocal, residence, it, also, tends, simultaneously, to, lead, to, general, non, sororal, polygyny, which, effectively, destroys, matrilocality, if, this, polygyny, factor, is, controlled, e, g, through, a, multiple, regression, model, division, of, labor, turns, out, to, be, a, significant, predictor, of, postmarital, residence, thus, murdock, s, hypotheses, regarding, the, relationships, between, the, sexual, division, of, labor, and, postmarital, residence, were, basically, correct, though, the, actual, relationships, between, those, two, groups, of, variables, are, more, complicated, than, he, expected, there, has, been, a, trend, toward, the, neolocal, residence, in, western, societies, marriage, laws, refer, to, the, legal, requirements, which, determine, the, validity, of, a, marriage, which, vary, considerably, between, countries, article, 16, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, declares, that, 1, men, and, women, of, full, age, without, any, limitation, due, to, race, nationality, or, religion, have, the, right, to, marry, and, to, found, a, family, they, are,

debts, of, the, marriage, this, has, a, basis, in, a, traditional, legal, notion, called, the, doctrine, of, necessities, whereby, in, a, heterosexual, marriage, a, husband, was, responsible, to, provide, necessary, things, for, his, wife, where, this, is, the, case, one, partner, may, be, sued, to, collect, a, debt, for, which, they, did, not, expressly, contract, critics, of, this, practice, note, that, debt, collection, agencies, can, abuse, this, by, claiming, an, unreasonably, wide, range, of, debts, to, be, expenses, of, the, marriage, the, cost, of, defense, and, the, burden, of, proof, is, then, placed, on, the, non, contracting, party, to, prove, that, the, expense, is, not, a, debt, of, the, family, the, respective, maintenance, obligations, both, during, and, eventually,

values, or, because, of, prejudice, and, fear, almost, all, cultures, that, recognize, marriage, also, recognize, adultery, as, a, violation, of, the, terms, of, marriage, most, jurisdictions, set, a, minimum, age, for, marriage, that, is, a, person, must, attain, a, certain, age, to, be, legally, allowed, to, marry, this, age, may, depend, on, circumstances, for, instance, exceptions, from, the, general, rule, may, be, permitted, if, the, parents, of, a, young, person, express, their, consent, and, or, if, a, court, decides, that, said, marriage, is, in, the, best, interest, of, the, young, person, often, this, applies, in, cases, where, a, girl, is, pregnant, although, most, age, restrictions, are, in, place, in, order, to, prevent, children, from, being, forced, into, marriages, especially, to, much, older, partners, marriages, which, can, have, negative, education, and, health, related, consequences, and, lead, to, child, sexual, abuse, and, other, forms, of, violence, such,

imposed, an, obligation, of, the, wife, to, be, sexually, available, for, her, husband, and, an, obligation, of, the, husband, to, provide, material, financial, support, for, the, wife, numerous, philosophers, feminists, and, other, academic, figures, have, commented, on, this, throughout, history, condemning, the, hypocrisy, of, legal, and, religious, authorities, in, regard, to, sexual, issues, pointing, to, the, lack, of, choice, of, a, woman, in, regard, to, controlling, her, own, sexuality, and, drawing, parallels, between, marriage, an, institution, promoted, as, sacred, and,

of, international, scrutiny, is, that, of, sexual, violence, within, marriage, throughout, much, of, the, history, in, most, cultures, sex, in, marriage, was, considered, a, right, that, could, be, taken, by, force, often, by, a, man, from, a, woman, if, denied, as, the, concept, of, human, rights, started, to, develop, in, the, 20th, century, and, with, the, arrival, of, second, wave, feminism, such, views, and, laws, have, become, less, widely, held, the, legal, and, social, concept, of, marital, rape, has, developed, in, most, industrialized, countries, in, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, in, many, other, parts, of, the, world, it, is, not, recognized, as, a, form, of, abuse, socially, or, legally, several, countries, in, eastern, europe, and, scandinavia, made, marital, rape, illegal, before, 1970, and, other, countries, in, western, europe, and, the, english, speaking, western, world, outlawed, it, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, england, and, wales, marital, rape, was, made, illegal, in, 1991, although, marital, rape, is, being, increasingly, criminalized, in, developing, countries, too, cultural, religious, and, traditional, ideologies, about, conjugal, rights, remain, very, strong, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, even, where, countries, may, have, adequate, laws, against, rape, in, marriage, these, laws, may, rarely, be, enforced, apart, from, the, issue, of, rape, committed, against, one, s, spouse, marriage, is, in, many, parts, of, the, world, closely, connected, with, other, forms, of, sexual, violence, in, some, places, like, morocco, unmarried, girls, and, women, who, are, raped, are, often, forced, by, their, families, to, marry, their, rapist, because, being, the, victim, of, rape, and, losing, virginity, carry, extreme, social, stigma, and, the, victims, are, deemed, to, have, their, reputation, tarnished, a, marriage, with, the, rapist, is, arranged, this, is, claimed, to, be, in, the, advantage, of, both, the, victim, who, does, not, remain, unmarried, and, does, not, lose, social, status, and, of, the, rapist, who, avoids, punishment, in, 2012, after, a, moroccan, 16, year, old, girl, committed, suicide, after, having, been, forced, by, her, family, to, marry, her, rapist, and, enduring, further, abuse, by, the, rapist, after, they, married, there, have, been, protests, from, activists, against, this, practice, which, is, common, in, morocco, in, some, societies, the, very, high, social, and, religious, importance, of, marital, fidelity, especially, female, fidelity, has, as, result, the, criminalization, of, adultery, often, with, harsh, penalties, such, as, stoning, or, flogging, as, well, as, leniency, towards, punishment, of, violence, related, to, infidelity, such, as, honor, killings, in, the, 21st, century, criminal, laws, against, adultery, have, become, controversial, with, international, organizations, calling, for, their, abolition, opponents, of, adultery, laws, argue, that, these, laws, are, a, major, contributor, to, discrimination, and, violence, against, women, as, they, are, enforced, selectively, mostly, against, women, that, they, prevent, women, from, reporting, sexual, violence, and, that, they, maintain, social, norms, which, justify, violent, crimes, committed, against, women, by, husbands, families, and, communities, a, joint, statement, by, the, united, nations, working, group, on, discrimination, against, women, in, law, and, in, practice, states, that, adultery, as, a, criminal, offence, violates, women, s, human, rights, some, human, rights, organizations, argue, that, the, criminalization, of, adultery, also, violates, internationally, recognized, protections, for, private, life, as, it, represents, an, arbitrary, interference, with, an, individual, s, privacy, which, is, not, permitted, under, international, law, the, laws, surrounding, heterosexual, marriage, in, many, countries, have, come, under, international, scrutiny, because, they, contradict, international, standards, of, human, rights, institutionalize, violence, against, women, child, marriage, and, forced, marriage, require, the, permission, of, a, husband, for, his, wife, to, work, in, a, paid, job, sign, legal, documents, file, criminal, charges, against, someone, sue, in, civil, court, etc, sanction, the, use, by, husbands, of, violence, to, discipline, their, wives, and, discriminate, against, women, in, divorce, such, things, were, legal, even, in, many, western, countries, until, recently, for, instance, in, france, married, women, obtained, the, right, to, work, without, their, husband, s, permission, in, 1965, and, in, west, germany, women, obtained, this, right, in, 1977, by, comparison, women, in, east, germany, had, many, more, rights, in, spain, during, franco, s, era, a, married, woman, needed, her, husband, s, consent, referred, to, as, the, permiso, marital, for, almost, all, economic, activities, including, employment, ownership, of, property, and, even, traveling, away, from, home, the, permiso, marital, was, abolished, in, 1975, an, absolute, submission, of, a, wife, to, her, husband, is, accepted, as, natural, in, many, parts, of, the, world, for, instance, surveys, by, unicef, have, shown, that, the, percentage, of, women, aged, 15, 49, who, think, that, a, husband, is, justified, in, hitting, or, beating, his, wife, under, certain, circumstances, is, as, high, as, 90, in, afghanistan, and, jordan, 87, in, mali, 86, in, guinea, and, timor, leste, 81, in, laos, 80, in, central, african, republic, detailed, results, from, afghanistan, show, that, 78, of, women, agree, with, a, beating, if, the, wife, goes, out, without, telling, him, and, 76, agree, if, she, argues, with, him, throughout, history, and, still, today, in, many, countries, laws, have, provided, for, extenuating, circumstances, partial, or, complete, defenses, for, men, who, killed, their, wives, due, to, adultery, with, such, acts, often, being, seen, as, crimes, of, passion, and, being, covered, by, legal, defenses, such, as, provocation, or, defense, of, family, honor, while, international, law, and, conventions, recognize, the, need, for, consent, for, entering, a, marriage, namely, that, people, cannot, be, forced, to, get, married, against, their, will, the, right, to, obtain, a, divorce, is, not, recognized, therefore, holding, a, person, in, a, marriage, against, their, will, if, such, person, has, consented, to, entering, in, it, is, not, considered, a, violation, of, human, rights, with, the, issue, of, divorce,

in, law, and, practice, has, been, and, continues, to, be, a, controversial, issue, in, many, countries, and, public, discourse, involves, different, ideologies, such, as, feminism, social, conservatism, religious, interpretations, in, recent, years, the, customs, of, dowry, and, bride, price, have, received, international, criticism, for, inciting, conflicts, between, families, and, clans, contributing, to, violence, against, women, promoting, materialism, increasing, property, crimes, where, men, steal, goods, such, as, cattle, in, order, to, be, able, to, pay, the, bride,

bastards, and, whoresons, there, are, significant, differences, between, world, regions, in, regard, to, the, social, and, legal, position, of, non, marital, births, ranging, from, being, fully, accepted, and, uncontroversial, to, being, severely, stigmatized, and, discriminated, the, 1975, european, convention, on, the, legal, status, of, children, born, out, of, wedlock, protects, the, rights, of, children, born, to, unmarried, parents, the, convention, states, among, others, that, the, father, and, mother, of, a, child, born, out, of, wedlock, shall, have, the, same, obligation, to, maintain, the, child, as, if, it, were, born, in, wedlock, and, that, a, child, born, out, of, wedlock, shall, have, the, same, right, of, succession, in, the, estate, of, its, father, and, its, mother, and, of, a, member, of, its, father, s, or, mother, s, family, as, if, it, had, been, born, in, wedlock, while, in, most, western, countries, legal, inequalities, between, children, born, inside, and, outside, marriage, have, largely, been, abolished, this, is, not, the, case, in, some, parts, of, the, world, the, legal, status, of, an, unmarried, father, differs, greatly, from, country, to, country, without, voluntary, formal, recognition, of, the, child, by, the, father, in, most, cases, there, is, a, need, of, due, process, of, law, in, order, to, establish, paternity, in, some, countries, however, unmarried, cohabitation, of, a, couple, for, a, specific, period, of, time, does, create, a, presumption, of, paternity, similar, to, that, of, formal, marriage, this, is, the, case, in, australia, under, what, circumstances, can, a, paternity, action, be, initiated, the, rights, and, responsibilities, of, a, father, once, paternity, has, been, established, whether, he, can, obtain, parental, responsibility, and, whether, he, can, be, forced, to, support, the, child, as, well, as, the, legal, position, of, a, father, who, voluntarily, acknowledges, the, child, vary, widely, by, jurisdiction, a, special, situation, arises, when, a, married, woman, has, a, child, by, a, man, other, than, her, husband, some, countries, such, as, israel, refuse, to, accept, a, legal,

as, the, uk, since, 2003, in, england, and, wales, 2006, in, scotland, and, 2002, in, northern, ireland, it, is, sufficient, for, the, father, to, be, listed, on, the, birth, certificate, for, him, to, have, parental, rights, in, other, countries, such, as, ireland, simply, being, listed, on, the, birth, certificate, does, not, offer, any, rights, additional, legal, steps, must, be, taken, if,

geographic, and, social, milieux, religious, attitudes, and, practices, relating, to, marriage, vary, but, have, many, similarities, the, bah, faith, encourages, marriage, and, views, it, as, a, mutually, strengthening, bond, a, bah, marriage, is, contingent, on, the, consent, of, all, living, parents, then, the, lord, god, made, a, woman, from, the, rib, he, had, taken, out, of, the, man, and, he, brought, her, to, the, man, the, man, said, this, is, now, bone, of, my, bones, and, flesh, of, my, flesh, she, shall, be, called, woman, for, she, was, taken, out, of, man, for, this, reason, a, man, will, leave, his, father, and, mother, and, be, united, to, his, wife, and, they, will, become, one, flesh, so, they, are, no, longer, two, but, one, therefore, what, god, has, joined, together, let, man, not, separate, modern, christianity, bases, its, views, on, marriage, upon, the, teachings, of, jesus, and, the, paul, the, apostle, many, of, the, largest, christian, denominations, regard, marriage, as, a, sacrament, sacred, institution, or, covenant, the, first, known, decrees, on, marriage, were, during, the, roman, catholic, council, of, trent, twenty, fourth, session, of, 1563, decrees, that, made, the, validity, of, marriage, dependent, on, the, wedding, occurring, in, the, presence, of, a, priest, and, two, witnesses, the, absence, of, a, requirement, of, parental, consent, ended, a, debate, that, proceeded, from, the, 12th, century, in, the, case, of, a, civil, divorce, the, innocent, spouse, had, and, has, no, right, to, marry, again, until, the, death, of, the, other, spouse, terminates, the, still, valid, marriage, even, if, the, other, spouse, was, guilty, of, adultery, the, christian, church, performed, marriages, in, the, narthex, of, the, church, prior, to, the, 16th, century, when, the, emphasis, was, on, the, marital, contract, and, betrothal, subsequently, the, ceremony, moved, inside, the, sacristy, of, the, church, christians, often, marry, for, religious, reasons, ranging, from, following, the, biblical, injunction, for, a, man, to, leave, his, father, and, mother, and, cleave, to, his, wife, and, the, two, shall, become, one, to, accessing, the, divine, grace, of, the, roman, catholic, sacrament, catholics, eastern, orthodox, as, well, as, many, anglicans, and, methodists, consider, marriage, termed, holy, matrimony, to, be, an, expression, of, divine, grace, termed, a, sacrament, and, mystery, in, the, first, two, christian, traditions, in, western, ritual, the, ministers, of, the, sacrament, are, the, spouses, themselves, with, a, bishop, priest, or, deacon, merely, witnessing, the, union, on, behalf, of, the, church, and, blessing, it, in, eastern, ritual, churches, the, bishop, or, priest, functions, as, the, actual, minister, of, the, sacred, mystery, eastern, orthodox, deacons, may, not, perform, marriages, western, christians, commonly, refer, to, marriage, as, a, vocation, while, eastern, christians, consider, it, an, ordination, and, a, martyrdom, though, the, theological, emphases, indicated, by, the, various, names, are, not, excluded, by, the, teachings, of, either, tradition, marriage, is, commonly, celebrated, in, the, context, of, a, eucharistic, service, a, nuptial, mass, or, divine, liturgy, the, sacrament, of, marriage, is, indicative, of, the, relationship, between, christ, and, the, church, the, roman, catholic, tradition, of, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, defined, marriage, as, a, sacrament, ordained, by, god, signifying, the, mystical, marriage, of, christ, to, his, church, the, matrimonial, covenant, by, which, a, man, and, a, woman, establish, between, themselves, a, partnership, of, the, whole, of, life, is, by, its, nature, ordered, toward, the, good, of, the, spouses, and, the, procreation, and, education, of, offspring, this, covenant, between, baptized, persons, has, been, raised, by, christ, the, lord, to, the, dignity, of, a, sacrament, for, catholic, and, methodist, christians, the, mutual, love, between, husband, and, wife, becomes, an, image, of, the, eternal, love, with, which, god, loves, humankind, in, the, united, methodist, church, the, celebration, of, holy, matrimony, ideally, occurs, in, the, context, of, a, service, of, worship, which, includes, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, likewise, the, celebration, of, marriage, between, two, catholics, normally, takes, place, during, the, public, liturgical, celebration, of, the, holy, mass, because, of, its, sacramental, connection, with, the, unity, of, the, paschal, mystery, of, christ, communion, sacramental, marriage, confers, a, perpetual, and, exclusive, bond, between, the, spouses, by, its, nature, the, institution, of, marriage, and, conjugal, love, is, ordered, to, the, procreation, and, upbringing, of, offspring, marriage, creates, rights, and, duties, in, the, church, between, the, spouses, and, towards, their, children, ntering, marriage, with, the, intention, of, never, having, children, is, a, grave, wrong, and, more, than, likely, grounds, for, an, annulment, according, to, roman, catholic, legislation, progeny, of, annulled, relationships, are, considered, legitimate, civilly, remarried, persons, who, civilly, divorced, a, living, and, lawful, spouse, are, not, separated, from, the, church, but, they, cannot, receive, eucharistic, communion, divorce, and, remarriage, while, generally, not, encouraged, are, regarded, differently, by, each, christian, denomination, with, certain, traditions, such, as, the, catholic, church, teaching, the, concept, of, an, annulment, for, example, the, reformed, church, in, america, permits, divorce, and, remarriage, while, connexions, such, as, the, evangelical, methodist, church, conference, forbid, divorce, except, in, the, case, of, fornication, and, do, not, allow, for, remarriage, in, any, circumstance, the, eastern, orthodox, church, allows, divorce, for, a, limited, number, of, reasons, and, in, theory, but, usually, not, in, practice, requires, that, a, marriage, after, divorce, be, celebrated, with, a, penitential, overtone, with, respect, to, marriage, between, a, christian, and, a, pagan, the, early, church, sometimes, took, a, more, lenient, view, invoking, the, so, called, pauline, privilege, of, permissible, separation, 1, cor, 7, as, legitimate, grounds, for, allowing, a, convert, to, divorce, a, pagan, spouse, and, then, marry, a, christian, the, catholic, church, adheres, to, the, proscription, of, jesus, in, matthew, 19, 6, that, married, spouses, who, have, consummated, their, marriage, are, no, longer, two, but, one, flesh, therefore, what, god, has, joined, together, no, human, being, must, separate, consequently, the, catholic, church, understands, that, it, is, wholly, without, authority, to, terminate, a, sacramentally, valid, and, consummated, marriage, and, its, codex, iuris, canonici, 1983, code, of, canon, law, confirms, this, in, canons, 1055, 7, specifically, canon, 1056, declares, that, the, essential, properties, of, marriage, are, unity, and, indissolubility, in, hristian, marriage, they, acquire, a, distinctive, firmness, by, reason, of, the, sacrament, canon, 1057, 2, declares, that, marriage, is, an, irrevocable, covenant, therefore, divorce, of, such, a, marriage, is, a, metaphysical, moral, and, legal, impossibility, however, the, church, has, the, authority, to, annul, a, presumed, marriage, by, declaring, it, to, have, been, invalid, from, the, beginning, i, e, declaring, it, not, to, be, and, never, to, have, been, a, marriage, in, an, annulment, procedure, which, is, basically, a, fact, finding, and, fact, declaring, effort, for, protestant, denominations, the, purposes, of, marriage, include, intimate, companionship, rearing, children, and, mutual, support, for, both, spouses, to, fulfill, their, life, callings, most, reformed, christians, did, not, regard, marriage, to, the, status, of, a, sacrament, because, they, did, not, regard, matrimony, as, a, necessary, means, of, grace, for, salvation, nevertheless, it, is, considered, a, covenant, between, spouses, before, god, cf, in, addition, some, protestant, denominations, such, as, the, methodist, churches, affirmed, that, holy, matrimony, is, a, means, of, grace, thus, sacramental, in, character, since, the, 16th, century, five, competing, models, have, shaped, marriage, in, the, western, tradition, as, described, by, john, witte, jr, members, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, believe, that, marriage, between, a, man, and, a, woman, is, ordained, of, god, and, that, the, family, is, central, to, the, creator, s, plan, for, the, eternal, destiny, of, his, children, their, view, of, marriage, is, that, family, relationships, can, endure, beyond, the, grave, this, is, known, as, eternal, marriage, which, can, be, eternal, only, when, authorized, priesthood, holders, perform, the, sealing, ordinance, in, sacred, temples, with, respect, to, religion, historic, christian, belief, emphasizes, that, christian, weddings, should, occur, in, a, church, as, christian, marriage, should, begin, where, one, also, starts, their, faith, journey, christians, receive, the, sacrament, of, baptism, in, church, in, the, presence, of, their, congregation, catholic, christian, weddings, must, take, place, in, a, church, building, as, holy, matrimony, is, a, sacrament, sacraments, normatively, occur, in, the, presence, of, christ, in, the, house, of, god, and, members, of, the, faith, community, present, to, witness, the, event, and, provide, support, and, encouragement, for, those, celebrating, the, sacrament, bishops, never, grant, permission, to, those, requesting, to, be, married, in, a, garden, on, the, beach, or, some, other, place, outside, of, the, church, and, a, dispensation, is, only, granted, in, extraordinary, circumstances, for, example, if, a, bride, or, groom, is, ill, or, disabled, and, unable, to, come, to, the, church, marriage, in, the, church, for, christians, is, seen, as, contributing, to, the, fruit, of, the, newlywed, couple, regularly, attending, church, each, lord, s, day, and, raising, children, in, the, faith, although, many, christian, denominations, do, not, currently, perform, same, sex, marriages, many, do, such, as, the, presbyterian, church, usa, some, dioceses, of, the, episcopal, church, the, metropolitan, community, church, quakers, united, church, of, canada, and, united, church, of, christ, congregations, and, some, anglican, dioceses, for, example, same, sex, marriage, is, recognized, by, various, religious, denominations, islam, also, commends, marriage, with, the, age, of, marriage, being, whenever, the, individuals, feel, ready, financially, and, emotionally, in, islam, polygyny, is, allowed, while, polyandry, is, not, with, the, specific, limitation, that, a, man, can, have, no, more, than, four, legal, wives, at, any, one, time, and, an, unlimited, number, of, female, slaves, as, concubines, who, may, have, rights, similar, wives, with, the, exception, of, not, being, free, unless, the, man, has, children, with, them, with, the, requirement, that, the, man, is, able, and, willing, to, partition, his, time, and, wealth, equally, among, the, respective, wives, and, concubines, this, practice, of, concubinage, as, in, judaism, is, not, applicable, in, contemporary, times, and, has, been, deemed, by, scholars, as, invalid, due, to, shifts, in, views, about, the, role, of, slavery, in, the, world, for, a, muslim, wedding, to, take, place, the, bridegroom, and, the, guardian, of, the, bride, wali, must, both, agree, on, the, marriage, should, the, guardian, disagree, on, the, marriage, it, may, not, legally, take, place, if, the, wali, of, the, girl, is, her, father, or, paternal, grandfather, he, has, the, right, to, force, her, into, marriage, even, against, her, proclaimed, will, if, it, is, her, first, marriage, the, exercise, of, this, power, is, however, very, strictly, regulated, in, the, interests, of, the, bride, a, guardian, who, is, allowed, to, force, the, bride, into, marriage, is, called, wali, mujbir, as, minors, are, not, in, a, position, to, make, a, declaration, of, their, wishes, which, is, valid, in, law, they, can, only, be, married, at, all, by, a, wali, mudjbir, but, a, woman, married, in, this, way, by, another, than, her, ascendant, is, entitled, on, coming, of, age, to, demand, that, her, marriage, be, declared, void, faskh, by, the, qadi, from, an, islamic, sharia, law, perspective, the, minimum, requirements, and, responsibilities, in, a, muslim, marriage, are, that, the, groom, provide, living, expenses, housing, clothing, food, maintenance, to, the, bride, and, in, return, the, bride, s, main, responsibility, is, raising, children, to, be, proper, muslims, all, other, rights, and, responsibilities, are, to, be, decided, between, the, husband, and, wife, and, may, even, be, included, as, stipulations, in, the, marriage, contract, before, the, marriage, actually, takes, place, so, long, as, they, do, not, go, against, the, minimum, requirements, of, the, marriage, in, sunni, islam, marriage, must, take, place, in, the, presence, of, at, least, two, reliable, witnesses, with, the, consent, of, the, guardian, of, the, bride, and, the, consent, of, the, groom, following, the, marriage, the, couple, may, consummate, the, marriage, to, create, an, urf, marriage, it, is, sufficient, that, a, man, and, a, woman, indicate, an, intention, to, marry, each, other, and, recite, the, requisite, words, in, front, of, a, suitable, muslim, the, wedding, party, usually, follows, but, can, be, held, days, or, months, later, whenever, the, couple, and, their, families, want, to, however, there, can, be, no, concealment, of, the, marriage, as, it, is, regarded, as, public, notification, due, to, the, requirement, of, witnesses, in, shia, islam, marriage, may, take, place, without, the, presence, of, witnesses, as, is, often, the, case, in, temporary, nikah, mut, ah, prohibited, in, sunni, islam, but, with, the, consent, of, both, the, bride, and, the, groom, following, the, marriage, they, may, consummate, their, marriage, in, judaism, marriage, is, based, on, the, laws, of, the, torah, and, is, a, contractual, bond, between, spouses, in, which, the, spouses, agree, to, be, consecrated, to, one, another, this, contract, is, called, kiddushin, though, procreation, is, not, the, sole, purpose, a, jewish, marriage, is, also, expected, to, fulfill, the, commandment, to, have, children, as, it, is, written, god, blessed, them, and, god, said, to, them, be, fertile, and, increase, the, main, focus, centers, around, the, relationship, between, the, spouses, kabbalistically, marriage, is, understood, to, mean, that, the, spouses, are, merging, into, a, single, soul, in, kabbalistic, thought, a, man, is, considered, incomplete, if, he, is, not, married, as, his, soul, is, only, one, part, of, a, larger, whole, that, remains, to, be, unified, the, hebrew, bible, describes, a, number, of, marriages, including, those, of, isaac, jacob, and, samson, polygyny, or, men, having, multiple, wives, at, once, is, one, of, the, most, common, marital, arrangements, represented, in, the, hebrew, bible, another, is, that, of, concubinage, pilagshut, which, was, often, arranged, by, a, man, and, a, woman, who, generally, enjoyed, the, same, rights, as, a, full, legal, wife, other, means, of, concubinage, are, observed, by, the, author, of, judges, 19, 20, or, during, war, as, in, deuteronomy, 21, 10, 12, the, rabbis, of, the, talmud, exhibited, discomfort, with, abduction, of, women, in, war, for, the, purpose, of, marriage, declaring, it, to, be, a, compromise, against, man, s, evil, inclination, to, be, avoided, today, ashkenazi, jews, are, prohibited, to, take, more, than, one, wife, because, of, a, ban, instituted, on, this, by, gershom, ben, judah, d, 1040, ce, however, academic, scholarship, indicates, that, prohibitions, on, polygyny, may, have, existed, far, earlier, based, on, the, damascus, covenant, among, ancient, hebrews, marriage, was, a, domestic, affair, and, not, a, religious, ceremony, no, officiant, or, witness, was, required, by, law, the, rambam, wrote, that, before, the, torah, was, given, when, a, man, would, meet, a, woman, in, the, marketplace, and, he, and, she, decided, to, marry, he, would, bring, her, home, conduct, relations, in, private, and, thus, make, her, his, wife, subsequently, to, the, torah, being, handed, down, at, sinai, however, the, jews, received, the, commandment, that, a, marriage, must, be, witnessed, betrothal, erusin, which, refers, to, the, time, that, this, binding, contract, is, made, is, distinct, from, marriage, itself, nissu, in, with, the, time, between, these, events, varying, substantially, in, biblical, times, a, wife, was, regarded, as, personal, property, belonging, to, her, husband, the, descriptions, of, the, bible, suggest, that, she, would, be, expected, to, perform, tasks, such, as, spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture, of, clothing, fetching, of, water, baking, of, bread, and, animal, husbandry, a, husband, s, obligations, to, his, wife, are, 1, to, provide, her, with, food, and, care, 2, to, supply, her, clothing, and, shelter, 3, to, share, a, home, with, her, 4, to, provide, the, ketubah, marriage, contract, 5, to, supply, medical, care, if, she, falls, ill, 6, to, ransom, her, back, if, she, is, kidnapped, 7, to, provide, proper, burial, when, she, dies, 8, to, provide, for, her, materially, if, he, predeceases, her, 9, to, provide, for, the, support, of, their, daughters, until, they, marry, or, become, adults, and, 10, to, see, that, their, sons, inherit, the, money, specified, in, her, ketubah, in, addition, to, their, portion, of, his, estate, men, are, also, obligated, sexually, to, their, wives, per, bt, ketubot, 61b, 10, with, the, frequency, of, marital,

parts, of, early, israelite, society, as, some, early, passages, of, the, bible, appear, to, portray, certain, wives, as, each, owning, a, tent, as, a, personal, possession, specifically, jael, sarah, and, jacob, s, wives, the, husband, too, is, indirectly, implied, to, have, some, responsibilities, to, his, wife, the, covenant, code, orders, if, he, take, him, another, her, food, her, clothing, and, her, duty, of, marriage, shall, he, not, diminish, or, lessen, if, the, husband, does, not, provide, the, first, wife, with, these, things, she, is, to, be, divorced, without, cost, to, her, the,

whatever, one, does, as, a, married, couple, which, is, more, than, just, sexual, activity, and, the, term, diminish, which, means, to, lessen, shows, the, man, must, treat, her, as, if, he, was, not,

subjected, to, the, ordeal, of, bitter, water, a, form, of, trial, by, ordeal, but, one, that, took, a, miracle, to, convict, the, literary, prophets, indicate, that, adultery, was, a, frequent,

century, placed, the, prime, of, life, at, 20, years, for, both, men, and, women, after, which, both, presumably, married, tacitus, states, that, ancient, germanic, brides, were, on, average, about, 20, and, were, roughly, the, same, age, as, their, husbands, tacitus, however, had, never, visited, the, german, speaking, lands, and, most, of, his, information, on, germania, comes, from, secondary, sources, in, addition, anglo, saxon, women, like, those, of, other, germanic, tribes, are, marked, as, women, from, the, age, of, 12, and, older, based, on, archaeological, finds, implying, that, the, age, of, marriage, coincided, with, puberty, from, the, early, christian, era, 30, to, 325, ce, marriage, was, thought, of, as, primarily, a, private, matter, with, no, uniform, religious, or, other,

middle, ages, marriages, were, arranged, sometimes, as, early, as, birth, and, these, early, pledges, to, marry, were, often, used, to, ensure, treaties, between, different, royal, families, nobles, and, heirs, of, fiefdoms, the, church, resisted, these, imposed, unions, and, increased, the, number, of, causes, for, nullification, of, these, arrangements, as, christianity, spread, during, the,

as, variable, depending, on, economic, circumstances, with, couples, delaying, marriage, until, the, early, twenties, when, times, were, bad, and, falling, to, the, late, teens, after, the, black, death, when, there, were, labor, shortages, by, appearances, marriage, of, adolescents, was, not, the, norm, in, england, where, the, strong, influence, of, classical, celtic, and, germanic, cultures, which, were, not, rigidly, patriarchal, helped, to, offset, the, judaeo, roman, patriarchal, influence, in, eastern, europe, the, tradition, of, early, and, universal, marriage, often, in, early, adolescence, as, well, as, traditional, slavic, patrilocal, custom, led, to, a, greatly, inferior, status, of, women, at, all, levels, of, society, the, average, age, of, marriage, for, most, of, northwestern, europe, from, 1500, to, 1800, was, around, 25, years, of, age, as, the, church, dictated, that, both, parties, had, to, be, at, least, 21, years, of, age, to, marry, without, the, consent, of, their, parents, the, bride, and, groom, were, roughly, the, same, age, with, most, brides, in, their, early, twenties, and, most, grooms, two, or, three, years, older, and, a, substantial, number, of, women, married, for, the, first, time, in, their, thirties, and, forties, particularly, in, urban, areas, with, the, average, age, at, first, marriage, rising, and, falling, as, circumstances, dictated, in, better, times, more, people, could, afford, to, marry, earlier, and, thus, fertility, rose, and, conversely, marriages, were, delayed, or, forgone, when, times, were, bad, thus, restricting, family, size, after, the, black, death, the, greater, availability, of, profitable, jobs, allowed, more, people, to, marry, young, and, have, more, children, but, the, stabilization, of, the, population, in, the, 16th, century, meant, fewer, job, opportunities, and, thus, more, people, delaying, marriages, the, age, of, marriage, was, not, absolute, however, as, child, marriages, occurred, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, later, with, just, some, of, them, including, as, part, of, the, protestant, reformation, the, role, of, recording, marriages, and,
