a, relationship, breakup, breakup, or, break, up, is, the, ending, of, a, relationship, the, act, is, commonly, termed, dumping, in, slang, when, it, is, initiated, by, one, partner, the, term, is, less, likely, to, be, applied, to, a, married, couple, where, a, breakup, is, typically, called, a, separation, or, divorce, when, a, couple, engaged, to, be, married, breaks, up, it, is, typically, called, a, broken, engagement, people, commonly, think, of, breakups, in, a, romantic, aspect, however, there, are, also, non, romantic, and, platonic, breakups, and, this, type, of, relationship, dissolution, is, usually, caused, by, failure, to, maintain, a, friendship, susie, orbach, 1992, has, argued, that, the, dissolution, of, dating, and, cohabiting, relationships, can, be, as, painful, as, or, more, painful, than, divorce, because, these, nonmarital, relationships, are, less, socially, recognized, kamiar, k, rueckert, argues, with, the, works, of, donald, winnicott, that, the, ability, to, be, alone, is, an, essentially, healthy, sign, of, emotional, development, and, maturity, once, a, child, has, obtained, closeness, and, attachment, by, their, early, caregivers, they, are, able, to, develop, autonomy, and, identity, if, children, have, not, introjected, the, good, and, protective, qualities, of, their, parents, they, will, fear, separation, and, break, ups, several, psychological, models, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, process, of, a, relationship, breakup, many, suggesting, that, relationship, dissolution, occurs, in, stages, mark, l, knapp, a, foundational, scholar, on, the, subject, of, interpersonal, relationships, created, a, model, called, knapp, s, relational, development, model, he, describes, two, separate, phases, of, relationships, coming, together, and, coming, apart, the, coming, together, phase, is, meant, to, be, long, term, beginning, in, the, initiation, phase, and, becoming, deeper, with, time, and, intimacy, in, the, coming, apart, phase, differentiating, begins, this, is, when, the, individuals, began, noticing, differences, that, may, seem, unnegotiable, or, place, pressure, on, the, relationship, this, leads, to, circumscribing, where, the, individuals, begin, to, pull, apart, set, boundaries, and, have, their, own, independent, lives, this, may, cause, issues, to, arise, at, this, point, the, relationship, reaches, stagnation, where, the, couple, stays, together, for, other, reasons, rather, than, their, will, to, do, so, examples, include, children, the, next, stage, is, avoidance, in, which, the, individuals, try, to, stay, away, from, each, other, as, much, as, possible, they, then, reach, termination, where, the, relationship, is, over, and, they, go, their, separate, ways, l, lee, proposes, that, there, are, five, stages, ultimately, leading, up, to, a, breakup, steve, duck, outlines, a, six, stage, cycle, of, relationship, breakup, hill, rubin, and, peplau, identify, five, factors, that, predict, breakup, before, marriage, gottman, and, levenson, 1994, outline, the, cascade, model, of, relational, dissolution, in, which, four, negative, nonverbal, behaviors, lead, to, the, breakdown, of, a, marriage, relationship, in, 1976, sociologist, diane, vaughan, proposed, an, uncoupling, theory, where, there, exists, a, turning, point, in, the, dynamics, of, relationship, breakup, a, precise, moment, when, they, knew, the, relationship, was, over, when, everything, went, dead, inside, followed, by, a, transition, period, in, which, one, partner, unconsciously, knows, the, relationship, is, going, to, end, but, holds, on, to, it, for, an, extended, period, even, for, years, vaughan, considered, that, the, process, of, breakup, was, asymmetrical, for, initiator, and, respondent, the, former, has, begun, mourning, the, loss, of, the, relationship, and, has, undertaken, something, tantamount, to, a, rehearsal, mentally, and, to, varying, degrees, experientially, of, a, life, apart, from, the, partner, the, latter, then, has, to, play, catch, up, to, make, their, own, transition, out, of, the, relationship, partners, must, redefine, initiator, and, relationship, negatively, legitimating, the, dissolution, as, a, result, for, vaughan, getting, out, of, a, relationship, includes, a, redefinition, of, self, at, several, levels, in, the, private, thoughts, of, the, individual, between, partners, and, in, the, larger, social, context, in, which, the, relationship, exists, she, considered, that, uncoupling, is, complete, when, the, partners, have, defined, themselves, and, are, defined, by, others, as, separate, and, independent, of, each, other, when, being, partners, is, no, longer, a, major, source, of, identity, katherine, woodward, thomas, a, licensed, marriage, and, family, therapist, originated, the, term, conscious, uncoupling, in, 2009, thomas, began, teaching, this, new, approach, to, divorce, to, students, throughout, the, world, the, term, received, popularization, by, gwyneth, paltrow, who, used, the, phrase, to, describe, her, divorce, with, chris, martin, paltrow, had, her, doctors, dr, sherry, sami, and, habib, sadeghi, and, his, wife, explain, the, conscious, uncoupling, when, she, first, made, the, news, of, her, divorce, public, a, conscious, uncoupling, is, the, ability, to, understand, that, every, irritation, and, argument, was, a, signal, to, look, inside, ourselves, and, identify, a, negative, internal, object, that, needed, healing, habib, sadeghi, explained, from, this, perspective, there, are, no, bad, guys, just, two, people, it, s, about, people, as, individuals, not, just, the, relationship, depending, on, the, individual, breakups, can, be, stressful, unpleasant, and, traumatic, events, both, parties, could, feel, a, large, number, of, negative, effects, as, a, result, of, the, relationship, s, dissolution, and, these, events, often, gain, the, reputation, for, being, some, of, the, worst, events, in, people, s, lives, these, could, include, psychological, distress, symptoms, grief, reactions, an, overall, decline, in, psychological, well, being, and, potential, stalking, behaviors, individuals, often, work, hard, to, keep, their, relationships, intact, because, of, how, significantly, distressing, and, problematic, these, negative, effects, can, be, even, in, the, face, of, potential, complications, in, their, relationship, for, as, long, as, they, can, bear, it, individuals, who, had, just, recently, experienced, the, dissolution, of, a, romantic, relationship, reported, several, symptoms, of, acute, psychological, distress, these, included, flashback, and, intrusive, memories, associated, with, their, partner, often, triggered, by, important, dates, associated, with, either, the, relationship, or, the, breakup, these, intrusive, distress, symptoms, manifested, in, various, ways, for, both, the, individual, who, initiated, the, breakup, and, their, partner, such, as, being, reminded, of, certain, aspects, of, their, behavior, or, their, preferences, another, set, of, psychological, distress, symptoms, that, were, reported, by, individuals, who, had, experienced, a, romantic, relationship, breakup, fell, under, the, category, of, avoidance, behavior, being, without, their, partner, causes, their, self, concept, to, shift, as, they, struggle, through, emotional, distress, this, involves, an, active, attempt, at, denying, or, ignoring, the, circumstances, of, the, current, situation, or, those, that, led, to, the, dissolution, of, the, relationship, in, relation, to, this, individuals, also, noted, feeling, numb, and, uninterested, with, the, world, around, them, because, of, the, breakup, the, combination, of, this, desire, to, engage, in, avoidance, behaviors, and, the, intrusive, memories, that, may, naturally, come, up, cause, individuals, to, feel, significant, emotional, swings, and, outbursts, in, the, form, of, irritation, anger, and, startle, responses, individuals, were, noted, as, being, far, more, paranoid, suspicious, and, jealous, often, tied, towards, a, desire, to, know, information, about, their, ex, partner, overall, these, psychological, distress, symptoms, come, together, to, result, in, a, significantly, lower, level, of, self, esteem, among, individuals, who, have, just, undergone, the, dissolution, of, a, romantic, relationship, additionally, individuals, undergo, a, significant, redefinition, of, their, self, concept, as, they, attempt, to, understand, who, they, are, without, their, ex, partner, this, compounds, upon, the, psychological, distress, symptoms, that, they, feel, from, the, loss, of, the, relationship, and, is, the, most, significant, negative, effect, that, people, undergoing, a, breakup, experience, a, natural, effect, of, the, loss, of, a, relationship, that, an, individual, had, hoped, to, keep, is, grief, because, the, desire, to, keep, relationships, intact, despite, problems, and, complications, is, a, natural, human, desire, this, results, in, individuals, undergoing, a, breakup, displaying, grief, reactions, that, include, symptoms, like, sleeplessness, depression, and, suicidal, thoughts, this, tendency, to, express, grief, and, depression, is, so, prevalent, that, researchers, point, to, it, being, a, significant, contributor, to, the, first, onset, of, major, depressive, disorder, in, young, adults, the, extent, of, these, grief, reactions, is, not, limited, to, the, time, frame, immediately, following, the, dissolution, of, the, romantic, relationship, even, some, time, after, the, breakup, people, who, are, asked, to, recall, depressing, or, negative, events, in, their, lives, commonly, make, reference, to, traumatic, events, of, this, nature, this, negative, effect, can, be, attributed, to, the, severity, of, the, grief, reaction, that, people, who, suffer, through, a, breakup, display, making, a, significant, mark, in, their, lives, that, they, are, unlikely, to, forget, in, addition, to, these, specific, negative, effects, individuals, who, are, suffering, through, a, breakup, report, a, general, decline, in, their, psychological, well, being, the, general, negative, emotion, that, they, feel, often, triggers, other, behaviors, and, habits, that, are, either, detrimental, to, their, mental, health, or, signify, poor, mental, health, conditions, these, include, a, behavior, that, has, been, noticed, following, some, breakups, is, the, prevalence, of, stalking, as, one, partner, attempts, to, maintain, contact, with, the, other, however, unwanted, it, may, be, this, type, of, behavior, exists, on, a, scale, that, stretches, from, an, amicable, breakup, with, no, unwanted, harassment, behaviors, all, the, way, to, stalking, behaviors, that, are, threatening, and, distressful, to, the, partner, this, behavior, stems, from, an, unhappiness, with, the, circumstances, following, the, dissolution, of, the, relationship, as, well, as, a, misguided, belief, that, the, stalking, behavior, may, result, in, the, reforming, of, the, relationship, there, is, no, clear, definition, of, stalking, behavior, that, differentiate, it, from, socially, acceptable, activities, they, become, more, sinister, when, they, are, unwanted, and, form, a, persistent, pattern, evidence, shows, that, even, in, the, direst, of, situations, there, is, a, chance, for, positive, emotions, and, growth, breakups, are, no, different, giving, victims, opportunities, for, stress, related, growth, improving, their, performance, in, future, relationships, and, providing, feelings, of, relief, and, freedom, jessica, kansky, and, joseph, p, allen, conducted, a, study, that, followed, 160, 20, to, 25, year, olds, or, emerging, adults, and, observed, their, romantic, and, close, friend, relationships, there, were, a, significant, number, of, findings, but, one, finding, was, that, the, experience, of, a, break, up, did, prove, positive, in, the, long, run, for, several, individuals, especially, if, they, knew, the, reason, s, the, relationship, ended, individuals, that, are, placed, under, stressful, situations, are, often, faced, with, an, opportunity, for, growth, and, development, as, a, result, of, this, stress, without, this, push, to, improve, individuals, are, often, pushed, towards, complacency, and, refuse, to, make, the, necessary, efforts, to, progress, through, life, different, ways, in, which, people, have, exhibited, growth, following, a, stressful, life, event, include, improvements, to, the, way, a, person, views, themselves, the, way, they, connect, with, other, people, around, them, or, their, overall, approach, to, life, research, shows, that, breakups, are, highly, representative, of, this, type, of, stressful, situation, as, individuals, experience, them, several, times, throughout, their, lives, and, have, been, known, to, self, report, instances, of, growth, because, of, the, experience, another, positive, outcome, that, has, been, observed, to, follow, breakup, has, to, do, with, the, lessons, that, people, may, have, learned, from, going, through, the, painful, experience, the, stress, related, growth, that, a, person, is, forced, to, experience, following, a, breakup, causes, improvements, to, their, overall, character, self, image, and, ability, to, interact, with, others, these, improvements, have, the, potential, to, improve, the, quality, of, future, romantic, relationships, with, other, people, this, is, due, to, the, increased, level, of, maturity, displayed, by, the, individual, as, well, as, to, a, lesser, extent, insight, into, certain, things, that, they, must, avoid, in, a, relationship, to, ensure, better, relationships, in, the, future, while, this, may, not, necessarily, be, a, universal, positive, consequence, that, affects, all, people, going, through, a, breakup, there, is, significant, evidence, towards, certain, individuals, experiencing, feelings, of, relief, freedom, and, happiness, following, the, end, of, a, relationship, there, is, a, high, likelihood, that, these, individuals, were, the, one, who, initiated, the, breakup, in, the, first, place, but, research, has, shown, that, there, have, been, cases, where, individuals, that, have, been, victims, of, a, breakup, recognize, that, their, past, relationship, was, sub, optimal, which, allows, them, to, display, the, same, emotions, of, relief, freedom, and, happiness, while, individuals, that, have, experienced, a, breakup, are, likely, to, experience, a, number, of, different, positive, and, negative, effects, once, the, relationship, has, run, its, course, different, people, can, expect, these, to, manifest, in, varying, degrees, this, is, because, there, are, several, mitigating, factors, that, can, either, minimize, or, amplify, the, extent, to, which, one, feels, the, consequences, of, a, breakup, the, list, of, potential, factors, that, have, been, shown, to, moderate, the, effects, that, an, individual, might, feel, are, categorized, and, listed, below, the, technologically, advanced, society, that, currently, exists, means, that, much, of, people, s, lives, are, online, people, can, date, online, via, dating, apps, or, using, social, media, platforms, such, as, instagram, or, facebook, many, relationships, have, been, able, to, manifest, from, mediated, communication, and, last, a, similar, amount, of, time, as, relationships, that, were, started, in, person, others, however, have, not, been, as, long, lived, the, presence, of, social, media, and, technology, also, plays, a, part, in, relationships, that, began, and, exist, in, person, as, well, there, has, been, much, controversy, about, the, stress, that, online, dating, places, on, relationships, the, constant, and, wide, range, of, accessibility, provided, by, technology, and, internet, access, can, lead, to, a, plethora, of, issues, that, may, result, in, break, ups, an, example, of, this, is, that, those, already, in, a, relationship, can, have, multiple, partners, that, are, also, dating, using, online, platforms, that, have, no, knowledge, of, each, other, due, to, the, unlimited, access, they, have, to, meet, people, from, all, over, the, world, once, a, partner, discovers, the, infidelity, this, could, result, in, a, breakup, online, dating, may, also, prohibit, choices, that, could, save, a, relationship, to, further, elaborate, many, times, in, relationships, space, is, necessary, to, collect, thoughts, and, feelings, after, an, argument, however, the, usage, of, social, media, allows, access, to, one, s, partner, at, all, times, this, constant, accessibility, may, result, in, disruption, of, both, space, and, boundaries, necessary, for, a, healthy, relationship, while, public, opinion, has, become, more, accepting, of, different, forms, of, relationships, including, those, that, are, not, heterosexual, lgbtq, couples, often, face, adversity, when, it, comes, to, maintaining, their, relationships, due, to, societal, based, homophobia, according, to, researchers, lahti, and, kolehmainen, studies, have, shown, that, lgbtq, couples, tend, to, feel, pressured, by, society, to, maintain, long, monogamous, and, healthy, relationships, they, may, struggle, in, silence, and, refuse, to, seek, help, or, end, a, relationship, when, it, may, be, in, their, best, interest, mentally, and, emotionally, because, of, this, pressure, their, studies, also, indicate, that, most, counseling, services, or, other, means, of, salvaging, a, relationship, have, heteronormative, assumptions, this, makes, it, difficult, for, lgbtq, couples, to, find, help, for, their, relationships, that, caters, to, the, issues, they, struggle, with, personally, other, unique, issues, arise, out, of, lgbtq, relationship, dissolutions, when, children, are, involved, according, to, researchers, goldberg, and, allen, lgbtq, separations, involving, children, can, become, legally, confusing, in, lesbian, relationships, there, are, two, mothers, so, the, question, arises, of, who, would, receive, full, custody, of, the, child, ren, many, times, the, court, system, favors, the, birth, mother, however, in, lesbian, relationships, one, mother, could, carry, the, egg, of, another, so, it, becomes, challenging, to, determine, who, the, child, ren, biologically, belongs, to, in, gay, male, relationship, dissolutions, this, also, causes, confusion, as, the, majority, of, gay, male, parents, adopted, their, children, due, to, the, heteronormative, society, that, currently, exists, lgbtq, couples, often, deal, with, challenges, post, break, up, there, is, a, lack, of, research, on, lgbtq, relationship, dissolutions, as, these, relationships, are, fairly, recent, to, acceptance, and, legality, in, history
