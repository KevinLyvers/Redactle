humans, and, their, hominid, relatives, have, consumed, eggs, for, millions, of, years, the, most, widely, consumed, eggs, are, those, of, fowl, especially, chickens, people, in, southeast, asia, began, harvesting, chicken, eggs, for, food, by, 1500, bce, eggs, of, other, birds, such, as, ducks, and, ostriches, are, eaten, regularly, but, much, less, commonly, than, those, of, chickens, people, may, also, eat, the, eggs, of, reptiles, amphibians, and, fish, fish, eggs, consumed, as, food, are, known, as, roe, or, caviar, hens, and, other, egg, laying, creatures, are, raised, throughout, the, world, and, mass, production, of, chicken, eggs, is, a, global, industry, in, 2009, an, estimated, 62, 1, million, metric, tons, of, eggs, were, produced, worldwide, from, a, total, laying, flock, of, approximately, 6, 4, billion, hens, there, are, issues, of, regional, variation, in, demand, and, expectation, as, well, as, current, debates, concerning, methods, of, mass, production, in, 2012, the, european, union, banned, battery, husbandry, of, chickens, bird, eggs, have, been, valuable, foodstuffs, since, prehistory, in, both, hunting, societies, and, more, recent, cultures, where, birds, were, domesticated, the, chicken, was, most, likely, domesticated, for, its, eggs, from, jungle, fowl, native, to, tropical, and, subtropical, southeast, asia, and, indian, subcontinent, before, 7500, bce, chickens, were, brought, to, sumer, and, egypt, by, 1500, bce, and, arrived, in, greece, around, 800, bce, where, the, quail, had, been, the, primary, source, of, eggs, in, thebes, egypt, the, tomb, of, haremhab, dating, to, approximately, 1420, bce, shows, a, depiction, of, a, man, carrying, bowls, of, ostrich, eggs, and, other, large, eggs, presumably, those, of, the, pelican, as, offerings, in, ancient, rome, eggs, were, preserved, using, a, number, of, methods, and, meals, often, started, with, an, egg, course, the, romans, crushed, the, shells, in, their, plates, to, prevent, evil, spirits, from, hiding, there, in, the, middle, ages, eggs, were, forbidden, during, lent, because, of, their, richness, although, the, motivation, for, forgoing, eggs, during, lent, was, not, entirely, religious, an, annual, pause, in, egg, consumption, allowed, farmers, to, rest, their, flocks, and, also, to, limit, their, hens, consumption, of, feed, during, a, time, of, year, when, food, stocks, were, usually, scarce, eggs, scrambled, with, acidic, fruit, juices, were, popular, in, france, in, the, seventeenth, century, this, may, have, been, the, origin, of, lemon, curd, the, dried, egg, industry, developed, in, the, nineteenth, century, before, the, rise, of, the, frozen, egg, industry, in, 1878, a, company, in, st, louis, missouri, started, to, transform, egg, yolk, and, egg, white, into, a, light, brown, meal, like, substance, by, using, a, drying, process, the, production, of, dried, eggs, significantly, expanded, during, world, war, ii, for, use, by, the, united, states, armed, forces, and, its, allies, in, 1911, the, egg, carton, was, invented, by, joseph, coyle, in, smithers, british, columbia, to, solve, a, dispute, about, broken, eggs, between, a, farmer, in, bulkley, valley, and, the, owner, of, the, aldermere, hotel, early, egg, cartons, were, made, of, paper, polystyrene, egg, cartons, became, popular, in, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, as, they, were, perceived, to, offer, better, protection, especially, against, heat, and, breakage, however, by, the, twenty, first, century, environmental, considerations, have, led, to, the, return, of, more, biodegradable, paper, cartons, often, made, of, recycled, material, that, once, again, became, more, widely, used, whereas, the, wild, asian, fowl, from, which, domesticated, chickens, are, descended, typically, lay, about, a, dozen, eggs, each, year, during, the, breeding, season, several, millennia, of, selective, breeding, have, produced, domesticated, hens, capable, of, laying, more, than, three, hundred, eggs, each, annually, and, to, lay, eggs, year, round, bird, eggs, are, a, common, food, and, one, of, the, most, versatile, ingredients, used, in, cooking, they, are, important, in, many, branches, of, the, modern, food, industry, the, most, commonly, used, bird, eggs, are, those, from, the, chicken, duck, and, goose, smaller, eggs, such, as, quail, eggs, are, used, occasionally, as, a, gourmet, ingredient, in, western, countries, eggs, are, a, common, everyday, food, in, many, parts, of, asia, such, as, china, and, thailand, with, asian, production, providing, 59, percent, of, the, world, total, in, 2013, the, largest, bird, eggs, from, ostriches, tend, to, be, used, only, as, special, luxury, food, gull, eggs, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, england, as, well, as, in, some, scandinavian, countries, particularly, in, norway, in, some, african, countries, guineafowl, eggs, often, are, seen, in, marketplaces, especially, in, the, spring, of, each, year, pheasant, eggs, and, emu, eggs, are, edible, but, less, widely, available, sometimes, they, are, obtainable, from, farmers, poulterers, or, luxury, grocery, stores, in, many, countries, wild, bird, eggs, are, protected, by, laws, which, prohibit, the, collecting, or, selling, of, them, or, permit, collection, only, during, specific, periods, of, the, year, in, 2017, world, production, of, chicken, eggs, was, 80, 1, million, tonnes, the, largest, producers, were, china, with, 31, 3, million, of, this, total, the, united, states, with, 6, 3, million, india, at, 4, 8, million, mexico, at, 2, 8, million, japan, at, 2, 6, million, and, brazil, and, russia, with, 2, 5, million, each, the, largest, egg, factory, in, british, columbia, for, example, ships, 12, million, eggs, per, week, for, the, month, of, january, 2019, the, united, states, produced, 9, 41, billion, eggs, with, 8, 2, billion, for, table, consumption, and, 1, 2, billion, for, raising, chicks, americans, are, projected, to, each, consume, 279, eggs, in, 2019, the, highest, since, 1973, but, less, than, the, 405, eggs, eaten, per, person, in, 1945, during, production, eggs, can, be, candled, to, check, their, quality, the, size, of, an, egg, s, air, cell, is, determined, and, if, fertilization, took, place, three, to, six, days, or, earlier, prior, to, the, candling, blood, vessels, can, typically, be, seen, as, evidence, that, the, egg, contains, an, embryo, contrary, to, common, misconception, this, is, not, conclusive, evidence, of, fertilization, as, blood, vessels, can, just, denote, an, ordinary, rupture, on, the, egg, yolk, surface, while, the, egg, was, forming, depending, on, local, regulations, eggs, may, be, washed, before, being, placed, in, egg, boxes, although, washing, may, shorten, their, length, of, freshness, bird, and, reptile, eggs, consist, of, a, protective, eggshell, albumen, egg, white, and, vitellus, egg, yolk, contained, within, various, thin, membranes, the, egg, yolk, is, suspended, in, the, egg, white, by, one, or, two, spiral, bands, of, tissue, called, the, chalazae, from, the, greek, word, meaning, hailstone, or, hard, lump, the, shape, of, a, chicken, egg, resembles, a, prolate, spheroid, with, one, end, larger, than, the, other, and, has, cylindrical, symmetry, along, the, long, axis, the, larger, end, of, the, egg, contains, an, air, cell, that, forms, when, the, contents, of, the, egg, cool, down, and, contract, after, it, is, laid, chicken, eggs, are, graded, according, to, the, size, of, this, air, cell, measured, during, candling, a, very, fresh, egg, has, a, small, air, cell, and, receives, a, grade, of, aa, as, the, size, of, the, air, cell, increases, and, the, quality, of, the, egg, decreases, the, grade, moves, from, aa, to, a, to, b, this, provides, a, way, of, testing, the, age, of, an, egg, as, the, air, cell, increases, in, size, due, to, air, being, drawn, through, pores, in, the, shell, as, water, is, lost, the, egg, becomes, less, dense, and, the, larger, end, of, the, egg, will, rise, to, increasingly, shallower, depths, when, the, egg, is, placed, in, a, bowl, of, water, a, very, old, egg, will, float, in, the, water, and, should, not, be, eaten, especially, if, a, foul, odor, can, be, detected, if, the, egg, is, cracked, open, eggshell, color, is, caused, by, pigment, deposition, during, egg, formation, in, the, oviduct, and, may, vary, according, to, species, and, breed, from, the, more, common, white, or, brown, to, pink, or, speckled, blue, green, the, brown, pigment, is, protoporphyrin, ix, a, precursor, of, heme, and, the, blue, pigment, is, biliverdin, a, product, of, the, breakdown, of, heme, generally, chicken, breeds, with, white, ear, lobes, lay, white, eggs, whereas, chickens, with, red, ear, lobes, lay, brown, eggs, although, there, is, no, significant, link, between, shell, color, and, nutritional, value, often, there, is, a, cultural, preference, for, one, color, over, another, see, color, of, eggshell, below, as, candling, is, less, effective, with, brown, eggs, they, have, a, significantly, higher, incidence, of, blood, spots, the, eggshell, membrane, is, a, clear, film, lining, the, eggshell, visible, when, one, peels, a, boiled, egg, primarily, it, is, composed, of, fibrous, proteins, such, as, collagen, type, i, these, membranes, may, be, used, commercially, as, a, dietary, supplement, white, is, the, common, name, for, the, clear, liquid, also, called, the, albumen, or, the, glair, glaire, contained, within, an, egg, colorless, and, transparent, initially, upon, cooking, it, turns, white, and, opaque, in, chickens, it, is, formed, from, the, layers, of, secretions, of, the, anterior, section, of, the, hen, oviduct, during, the, passage, of, the, egg, it, forms, around, both, fertilized, and, unfertilized, yolks, the, primary, natural, purpose, of, egg, white, is, to, protect, the, yolk, and, provide, additional, nutrition, during, the, growth, of, the, embryo, egg, white, consists, primarily, of, approximately, 90, percent, water, into, which, is, dissolved, 10, percent, proteins, including, albumins, mucoproteins, and, globulins, unlike, the, yolk, which, is, high, in, lipids, fats, egg, white, contains, almost, no, fat, and, the, carbohydrate, content, is, less, than, one, percent, egg, white, has, many, uses, in, food, and, many, other, applications, including, the, preparation, of, vaccines, such, as, those, for, influenza, the, yolk, in, a, newly, laid, egg, is, round, and, firm, as, the, yolk, ages, it, absorbs, water, from, the, albumen, which, increases, its, size, and, causes, it, to, stretch, and, weaken, the, vitelline, membrane, the, clear, casing, enclosing, the, yolk, the, resulting, effect, is, a, flattened, and, enlarged, yolk, shape, yolk, color, is, dependent, on, the, diet, of, the, hen, if, the, diet, contains, yellow, or, orange, plant, pigments, known, as, xanthophylls, then, they, are, deposited, in, the, yolk, coloring, it, lutein, is, the, most, abundant, pigment, in, egg, yolk, a, diet, without, such, colorful, foods, may, result, in, an, almost, colorless, yolk, yolk, color, is, for, example, enhanced, if, the, diet, includes, foods, such, as, yellow, corn, and, marigold, petals, in, the, us, the, use, of, artificial, color, additives, is, forbidden, abnormalities, that, have, been, found, in, eggs, purchased, for, human, consumption, include, chicken, eggs, are, widely, used, in, many, types, of, dishes, both, sweet, and, savory, including, many, baked, goods, some, of, the, most, common, preparation, methods, include, scrambled, fried, poached, hard, boiled, soft, boiled, omelettes, and, pickled, they, also, may, be, eaten, raw, although, this, is, not, recommended, for, people, who, may, be, especially, susceptible, to, salmonellosis, such, as, the, elderly, the, infirm, or, pregnant, women, in, addition, the, protein, in, raw, eggs, is, only, 51, percent, bioavailable, whereas, that, of, a, cooked, egg, is, nearer, 91, percent, bioavailable, meaning, the, protein, of, cooked, eggs, is, nearly, twice, as, absorbable, as, the, protein, from, raw, eggs, as, a, cooking, ingredient, egg, yolks, are, an, important, emulsifier, in, the, kitchen, and, are, also, used, as, a, thickener, as, in, custards, the, albumen, egg, white, contains, protein, but, little, or, no, fat, and, may, be, used, in, cooking, separately, from, the, yolk, the, proteins, in, egg, white, allow, it, to, form, foams, and, aerated, dishes, egg, whites, may, be, aerated, or, whipped, to, a, light, fluffy, consistency, and, often, are, used, in, desserts, such, as, meringues, and, mousse, ground, eggshells, sometimes, are, used, as, a, food, additive, to, deliver, calcium, every, part, of, an, egg, is, edible, although, the, eggshell, is, generally, discarded, some, recipes, call, for, immature, or, unlaid, eggs, which, are, harvested, after, the, hen, is, slaughtered, or, cooked, while, still, inside, the, chicken, eggs, contain, multiple, proteins, that, gel, at, different, temperatures, within, the, yolk, and, the, white, and, the, temperature, determines, the, gelling, time, egg, yolk, becomes, a, gel, or, solidifies, between, 61, and, 70, c, 142, and, 158, f, egg, white, gels, at, different, temperatures, 60, to, 73, c, 140, to, 163, f, the, white, contains, exterior, albumen, which, sets, at, the, highest, temperature, in, practice, in, many, cooking, processes, the, white, gels, first, because, it, is, exposed, to, higher, temperatures, for, longer, salmonella, is, killed, instantly, at, 71, c, 160, f, but, also, is, killed, from, 54, 5, c, 130, 1, f, if, held, at, that, temperature, for, sufficiently, long, time, periods, to, avoid, the, issue, of, salmonella, eggs, may, be, pasteurized, in, shell, at, 57, c, 135, f, for, an, hour, and, 15, minutes, although, the, white, then, is, slightly, milkier, the, eggs, may, be, used, in, normal, ways, whipping, for, meringue, takes, significantly, longer, but, the, final, volume, is, virtually, the, same, if, a, boiled, egg, is, overcooked, a, greenish, ring, sometimes, appears, around, the, egg, yolk, due, to, changes, to, the, iron, and, sulfur, compounds, in, the, egg, it, also, may, occur, with, an, abundance, of, iron, in, the, cooking, water, overcooking, harms, the, quality, of, the, protein, chilling, an, overcooked, egg, for, a, few, minutes, in, cold, water, until, it, is, completely, cooled, may, prevent, the, greenish, ring, from, forming, on, the, surface, of, the, yolk, peeling, a, cooked, egg, is, easiest, when, the, egg, was, put, into, boiling, water, as, opposed, to, slowly, heating, the, egg, from, a, start, in, cold, water, although, the, age, of, the, egg, and, the, conditions, of, its, storage, have, a, greater, influence, the, bird, s, diet, affects, the, flavor, of, the, egg, for, example, when, a, brown, egg, chicken, breed, eats, rapeseed, canola, or, soy, meals, its, intestinal, microbes, metabolize, them, into, fishy, smelling, triethylamine, which, ends, up, in, the, egg, the, unpredictable, diet, of, free, range, hens, will, produce, likewise, unpredictable, egg, flavors, duck, eggs, tend, to, have, a, flavor, distinct, from, but, still, resembling, chicken, eggs, eggs, may, be, soaked, in, mixtures, to, absorb, flavor, tea, eggs, a, common, snack, sold, from, street, side, carts, in, china, are, steeped, in, a, brew, from, a, mixture, of, various, spices, soy, sauce, and, black, tea, leaves, to, give, flavor, careful, storage, of, edible, eggs, is, extremely, important, as, an, improperly, handled, egg, may, contain, elevated, levels, of, salmonella, bacteria, that, may, cause, severe, food, poisoning, in, the, us, eggs, are, washed, this, cleans, the, shell, but, erodes, its, cuticle, the, usda, thus, recommends, refrigerating, eggs, to, prevent, the, growth, of, salmonella, refrigeration, also, preserves, the, taste, and, texture, however, intact, eggs, unwashed, and, unbroken, may, be, left, unrefrigerated, for, several, months, without, spoiling, in, europe, eggs, are, not, usually, washed, and, the, shells, are, dirtier, however, the, cuticle, is, undamaged, and, they, do, not, require, refrigeration, in, the, uk, in, particular, hens, are, immunized, against, salmonella, and, generally, their, eggs, are, safe, for, 21, days, the, simplest, method, to, preserve, an, egg, is, to, treat, it, with, salt, salt, draws, water, out, of, bacteria, and, molds, which, prevents, their, growth, the, chinese, salted, duck, egg, is, made, by, immersing, duck, eggs, in, brine, or, coating, them, individually, with, a, paste, of, salt, and, mud, or, clay, the, eggs, stop, absorbing, salt, after, approximately, a, month, having, reached, osmotic, equilibrium, their, yolks, take, on, an, orange, red, color, and, solidify, but, the, white, remains, somewhat, liquid, these, often, are, boiled, before, consumption, and, are, served, with, rice, congee, another, method, is, to, make, pickled, eggs, by, boiling, them, first, and, immersing, them, in, a, mixture, of, vinegar, salt, and, spices, such, as, ginger, or, allspice, frequently, beetroot, juice, is, added, to, impart, a, red, color, to, the, eggs, if, the, eggs, are, immersed, in, it, for, a, few, hours, the, distinct, red, white, and, yellow, colors, may, be, seen, when, the, eggs, are, sliced, if, marinated, for, several, days, or, more, the, red, color, will, reach, the, yolk, if, the, eggs, are, marinated, in, the, mixture, for, several, weeks, or, more, the, vinegar, will, dissolve, much, of, the, shell, s, calcium, carbonate, and, penetrate, the, egg, making, it, acidic, enough, to, inhibit, the, growth, of, bacteria, and, molds, pickled, eggs, made, this, way, generally, keep, for, a, year, or, more, without, refrigeration, a, century, egg, or, hundred, year, old, egg, is, preserved, by, coating, an, egg, in, a, mixture, of, clay, wood, ash, salt, lime, and, rice, straw, for, several, weeks, to, several, months, depending, on, the, method, of, processing, after, the, process, is, completed, the, yolk, becomes, a, dark, green, cream, like, substance, with, a, strong, odor, of, sulfur, and, ammonia, while, the, white, becomes, a, dark, brown, transparent, jelly, with, a, comparatively, mild, distinct, flavor, the, transforming, agent, in, a, century, egg, is, its, alkaline, material, which, gradually, raises, the, ph, of, the, egg, from, approximately, 9, to, 12, or, more, this, chemical, process, breaks, down, some, of, the, complex, flavorless, proteins, and, fats, of, the, yolk, into, simpler, flavorful, ones, which, in, some, way, may, be, thought, of, as, an, inorganic, version, of, fermentation, egg, yolks, and, whole, eggs, store, significant, amounts, of, protein, and, choline, due, to, their, protein, content, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, formerly, categorized, eggs, as, meat, within, the, food, guide, pyramid, now, myplate, a, 50, gram, 1, 8, oz, medium, large, chicken, egg, provides, approximately, 70, kilocalories, 290, kj, of, food, energy, and, 6, grams, of, protein, eggs, boiled, supply, several, vitamins, and, minerals, as, significant, amounts, of, the, daily, value, dv, including, per, 100g, vitamin, a, 19, dv, riboflavin, 42, dv, pantothenic, acid, 28, dv, vitamin, b, 12, 46, dv, choline, 60, dv, phosphorus, 25, dv, zinc, 11, dv, and, vitamin, d, 15, dv, cooking, methods, affect, the, nutritional, values, of, eggs, the, diet, of, laying, hens, also, may, affect, the, nutritional, quality, of, eggs, for, instance, chicken, eggs, that, are, especially, high, in, omega, 3, fatty, acids, are, produced, by, feeding, hens, a, diet, containing, polyunsaturated, fats, from, sources, such, as, fish, oil, chia, seeds, or, flaxseeds, pasture, raised, free, range, hens, which, forage, for, their, own, food, also, produce, eggs, that, are, relatively, enriched, in, omega, 3, fatty, acids, when, compared, to, those, of, cage, raised, chickens, a, 2010, usda, study, determined, there, were, no, significant, differences, of, macronutrients, in, various, chicken, eggs, cooked, eggs, are, easier, to, digest, than, raw, eggs, as, well, as, having, a, lower, risk, of, salmonellosis, more, than, half, the, calories, found, in, eggs, come, from, the, fat, in, the, yolk, 50, grams, of, chicken, egg, the, contents, of, an, egg, just, large, enough, to, be, classified, as, large, in, the, us, but, medium, in, europe, contains, approximately, five, grams, of, fat, saturated, fat, palmitic, stearic, and, myristic, acids, makes, up, 27, percent, of, the, fat, in, an, egg, the, egg, white, consists, primarily, of, water, 88, percent, and, protein, 11, percent, with, no, cholesterol, and, 0, 2, percent, fat, there, is, debate, over, whether, egg, yolk, presents, a, health, risk, some, research, suggests, dietary, cholesterol, increases, the, ratio, of, total, to, hdl, cholesterol, and, therefore, adversely, affects, the, body, s, cholesterol, profile, whereas, other, studies, show, that, moderate, consumption, of, eggs, up, to, one, a, day, does, not, appear, to, increase, heart, disease, risk, in, healthy, individuals, harold, mcgee, argues, that, the, cholesterol, in, the, egg, yolk, is, not, what, causes, a, problem, because, fat, particularly, saturated, fat, is, much, more, likely, to, raise, cholesterol, levels, than, the, consumption, of, cholesterol, studies, have, shown, conflicting, results, about, a, possible, connection, between, egg, consumption, and, type, 2, diabetes, a, meta, analysis, from, 2013, found, that, eating, four, eggs, per, week, was, associated, with, a, 29, percent, increase, in, the, relative, risk, of, developing, diabetes, another, meta, analysis, from, 2013, also, supported, the, idea, that, egg, consumption, may, lead, to, an, increased, incidence, of, type, two, diabetes, a, 2016, meta, analysis, suggested, that, association, of, egg, consumption, with, increased, risk, of, incident, type, 2, diabetes, may, be, restricted, to, cohort, studies, from, the, united, states, a, 2020, meta, analysis, found, that, there, was, no, overall, association, between, moderate, egg, consumption, and, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, and, that, the, risk, found, in, us, studies, was, not, found, in, european, or, asian, studies, a, 2015, meta, analysis, found, an, association, between, higher, egg, consumption, five, a, week, with, increased, risk, of, breast, cancer, compared, to, no, egg, consumption, another, meta, analysis, found, that, egg, consumption, may, increase, ovarian, cancer, risk, a, 2019, meta, analysis, found, an, association, between, high, egg, consumption, and, risk, of, upper, aero, digestive, tract, cancers, in, hospital, based, case, control, studies, a, 2021, review, did, not, find, a, significant, association, between, egg, consumption, and, breast, cancer, a, 2021, umbrella, review, found, that, egg, consumption, significantly, increases, the, risk, of, ovarian, cancer, one, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, egg, consumption, found, that, higher, consumption, of, eggs, more, than, 1, egg, day, was, associated, with, a, significant, reduction, in, risk, of, coronary, artery, disease, another, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, dietary, cholesterol, and, egg, consumption, found, that, egg, consumption, was, associated, with, an, increased, all, cause, mortality, and, cvd, mortality, these, contrary, results, may, be, due, to, somewhat, different, methods, of, study, selection, and, the, use, primarily, of, observational, studies, where, confounding, factors, are, not, controlled, a, 2018, meta, analysis, of, randomized, clinical, trials, found, that, consumption, of, eggs, increases, total, cholesterol, tc, ldl, c, and, hdl, c, compared, to, no, egg, consumption, but, not, to, low, egg, control, diets, in, 2020, two, meta, analyses, found, that, moderate, egg, consumption, up, to, one, egg, a, day, is, not, associated, with, an, increased, cardiovascular, disease, risk, a, 2020, umbrella, review, concluded, that, increased, egg, consumption, is, not, associated, with, cardiovascular, disease, risk, in, the, general, population, another, umbrella, review, found, no, association, between, egg, consumption, and, cardiovascular, disorders, a, 2013, meta, analysis, found, no, association, between, egg, consumption, and, heart, disease, or, stroke, a, 2013, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, found, no, association, between, egg, consumption, and, cardiovascular, disease, or, cardiovascular, disease, mortality, but, did, find, egg, consumption, of, more, than, once, daily, increased, cardiovascular, disease, risk, 1, 69, fold, in, those, with, type, 2, diabetes, mellitus, when, compared, to, type, 2, diabetics, who, ate, less, than, one, egg, per, week, another, 2013, meta, analysis, found, that, eating, four, eggs, per, week, increased, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, by, six, percent, eggs, are, one, of, the, largest, sources, of, phosphatidylcholine, lecithin, in, the, human, diet, a, study, published, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, showed, that, dietary, phosphatidylcholine, is, digested, by, bacteria, in, the, gut, and, eventually, converted, into, the, compound, tmao, a, compound, linked, with, increased, heart, disease, another, study, found, that, type, 2, diabetes, mellitus, and, kidney, disease, also, increase, tmao, levels, and, that, evidence, for, a, link, between, tmao, and, cardiovascular, diseases, may, be, due, to, confounding, or, reverse, causality, egg, consumption, does, not, increase, hypertension, risk, a, 2016, meta, analysis, found, that, consumption, of, up, to, one, egg, a, day, may, contribute, to, a, decreased, risk, of, total, stroke, two, recent, meta, analyses, found, no, association, between, egg, intake, and, risk, of, stroke, a, 2019, meta, analysis, revealed, that, egg, consumption, has, no, significant, effect, on, serum, biomarkers, of, inflammation, a, 2021, review, of, clinical, trials, found, that, egg, consumption, has, beneficial, effects, on, macular, pigment, optical, density, and, serum, lutein, a, health, issue, associated, with, eggs, is, contamination, by, pathogenic, bacteria, such, as, salmonella, enteritidis, contamination, of, eggs, with, other, members, of, the, genus, salmonella, while, exiting, a, female, bird, via, the, cloaca, may, occur, so, care, must, be, taken, to, prevent, the, egg, shell, from, becoming, contaminated, with, fecal, matter, in, commercial, practice, in, the, us, eggs, are, quickly, washed, with, a, sanitizing, solution, within, minutes, of, being, laid, the, risk, of, infection, from, raw, or, undercooked, eggs, is, dependent, in, part, upon, the, sanitary, conditions, under, which, the, hens, are, kept, health, experts, advise, people, to, refrigerate, washed, eggs, use, them, within, two, weeks, cook, them, thoroughly, and, never, consume, raw, eggs, as, with, meat, containers, and, surfaces, that, have, been, used, to, process, raw, eggs, should, not, come, in, contact, with, ready, to, eat, food, a, study, by, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, in, 2002, risk, analysis, april, 2002, 22, 2, 203, 18, suggests, the, problem, is, not, so, prevalent, in, the, u, s, as, once, thought, it, showed, that, of, the, 69, billion, eggs, produced, annually, only, 2, 3, million, are, contaminated, with, salmonella, equivalent, to, just, one, in, every, 30, 000, eggs, thus, showing, salmonella, infection, is, quite, rarely, induced, by, eggs, this, has, not, been, the, case, in, other, countries, however, where, salmonella, enteritidis, and, salmonella, typhimurium, infections, due, to, egg, consumption, are, major, concerns, egg, shells, act, as, hermetic, seals, that, guard, against, bacteria, entering, but, this, seal, can, be, broken, through, improper, handling, or, if, laid, by, unhealthy, chickens, most, forms, of, contamination, enter, through, such, weaknesses, in, the, shell, in, the, uk, the, british, egg, industry, council, awards, the, lions, stamp, to, eggs, that, among, other, things, come, from, hens, that, have, been, vaccinated, against, salmonella, in, 2017, authorities, blocked, millions, of, eggs, from, sale, in, the, netherlands, belgium, and, germany, because, of, contamination, with, the, insecticide, fipronil, one, of, the, most, common, food, allergies, in, infants, is, eggs, infants, usually, have, the, opportunity, to, grow, out, of, this, allergy, during, childhood, if, exposure, is, minimized, allergic, reactions, against, egg, white, are, more, common, than, reactions, against, egg, yolks, in, addition, to, true, allergic, reactions, some, people, experience, a, food, intolerance, to, egg, whites, food, labeling, practices, in, most, developed, countries, now, include, eggs, egg, products, and, the, processing, of, foods, on, equipment, that, also, process, foods, containing, eggs, in, a, special, allergen, alert, section, of, the, ingredients, on, the, labels, most, commercially, farmed, chicken, eggs, intended, for, human, consumption, are, unfertilized, since, the, laying, hens, are, kept, without, roosters, fertile, eggs, may, be, eaten, with, little, nutritional, difference, when, compared, to, the, unfertilized, fertile, eggs, will, not, contain, a, developed, embryo, as, refrigeration, temperatures, inhibit, cellular, growth, for, an, extended, period, of, time, sometimes, an, embryo, is, allowed, to, develop, but, eaten, before, hatching, as, with, balut, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, grades, eggs, by, the, interior, quality, of, the, egg, see, haugh, unit, and, the, appearance, and, condition, of, the, egg, shell, eggs, of, any, quality, grade, may, differ, in, weight, size, in, australia, and, the, european, union, eggs, are, graded, by, the, hen, raising, method, free, range, battery, caged, etc, chicken, eggs, are, graded, by, size, for, the, purpose, of, sales, some, maxi, eggs, may, have, double, yolks, and, some, farms, separate, out, double, yolk, eggs, for, special, sale, although, eggshell, color, is, a, largely, cosmetic, issue, with, no, effect, on, egg, quality, or, taste, it, is, a, major, issue, in, production, due, to, regional, and, national, preferences, for, specific, colors, and, the, results, of, such, preferences, on, demand, for, example, in, most, regions, of, the, united, states, chicken, eggs, generally, are, white, however, brown, eggs, are, more, common, in, some, parts, of, the, northeastern, united, states, particularly, new, england, where, a, television, jingle, for, years, proclaimed, brown, eggs, are, local, eggs, and, local, eggs, are, fresh, local, chicken, breeds, including, the, rhode, island, red, lay, brown, eggs, brown, eggs, are, preferred, in, china, costa, rica, ireland, france, and, the, united, kingdom, in, brazil, and, poland, white, chicken, eggs, are, generally, regarded, as, industrial, and, brown, or, reddish, ones, are, preferred, small, farms, and, smallholdings, particularly, in, economically, advanced, nations, may, sell, eggs, of, widely, varying, colors, and, sizes, with, combinations, of, white, brown, speckled, red, green, and, blue, as, laid, by, certain, breeds, including, araucanas, heritage, skyline, and, cream, leg, bar, eggs, in, the, same, box, or, carton, while, the, supermarkets, at, the, same, time, sell, mostly, eggs, from, the, larger, producers, of, the, color, preferred, in, that, nation, or, region, these, cultural, trends, have, been, observed, for, many, years, the, new, york, times, reported, during, the, second, world, war, that, housewives, in, boston, preferred, brown, eggs, and, those, in, new, york, preferred, white, eggs, in, february, 1976, the, new, scientist, magazine, in, discussing, issues, of, chicken, egg, color, stated, housewives, are, particularly, fussy, about, the, colour, of, their, eggs, preferring, even, to, pay, more, for, brown, eggs, although, white, eggs, are, just, as, good, as, a, result, of, these, trends, brown, eggs, are, usually, more, expensive, to, purchase, in, regions, where, white, eggs, are, considered, normal, due, to, lower, production, in, france, and, the, united, kingdom, it, is, very, difficult, to, buy, white, eggs, with, most, supermarkets, supplying, only, the, more, popular, brown, eggs, by, direct, contrast, in, egypt, it, is, very, hard, to, source, brown, eggs, as, demand, is, almost, entirely, for, white, ones, with, the, country, s, largest, supplier, describing, white, eggs, as, table, eggs, and, packaging, brown, eggs, for, export, research, conducted, by, a, french, institute, in, the, 1970s, demonstrated, blue, chicken, eggs, from, the, chilean, araucana, fowl, may, be, stronger, and, more, resilient, to, breakage, research, at, nihon, university, japan, in, 1990, revealed, a, number, of, different, issues, were, important, to, japanese, housewives, when, deciding, which, eggs, to, buy, and, that, color, was, a, distinct, factor, with, most, japanese, housewives, preferring, the, white, color, egg, producers, carefully, consider, cultural, issues, as, well, as, commercial, ones, when, selecting, the, breed, or, breeds, of, chickens, used, for, production, as, egg, color, varies, between, breeds, among, producers, and, breeders, brown, eggs, often, are, referred, to, as, tinted, while, the, speckled, eggs, preferred, by, some, consumers, often, are, referred, to, as, being, red, in, color, commercial, factory, farming, operations, often, involve, raising, the, hens, in, small, crowded, cages, preventing, the, chickens, from, engaging, in, natural, behaviors, such, as, wing, flapping, dust, bathing, scratching, pecking, perching, and, nest, building, such, restrictions, may, lead, to, pacing, and, escape, behavior, many, hens, confined, to, battery, cages, and, some, raised, in, cage, free, conditions, are, debeaked, to, prevent, them, from, harming, each, other, and, engaging, in, cannibalism, according, to, critics, of, the, practice, this, can, cause, hens, severe, pain, to, the, point, where, some, may, refuse, to, eat, and, starve, to, death, some, hens, may, be, forced, to, molt, to, increase, egg, quality, and, production, level, after, the, molting, molting, can, be, induced, by, extended, food, withdrawal, water, withdrawal, or, controlled, lighting, programs, laying, hens, often, are, euthanized, when, reaching, 100, to, 130, weeks, of, age, when, their, egg, productivity, starts, to, decline, due, to, modern, selective, breeding, laying, hen, strains, differ, from, meat, production, strains, as, male, birds, of, the, laying, strain, do, not, lay, eggs, and, are, not, suitable, for, meat, production, they, generally, are, killed, soon, after, they, hatch, free, range, eggs, are, considered, by, some, advocates, to, be, an, acceptable, substitute, to, factory, farmed, eggs, free, range, laying, hens, are, given, outdoor, access, instead, of, being, contained, in, crowded, cages, questions, regarding, the, living, conditions, of, free, range, hens, have, been, raised, in, the, united, states, of, america, as, there, is, no, legal, definition, or, regulations, for, eggs, labeled, as, free, range, in, that, country, in, the, united, states, increased, public, concern, for, animal, welfare, has, pushed, various, egg, producers, to, promote, eggs, under, a, variety, of, standards, the, most, widespread, standard, in, use, is, determined, by, united, egg, producers, through, their, voluntary, program, of, certification, the, united, egg, producers, program, includes, guidelines, regarding, housing, food, water, air, living, space, beak, trimming, molting, handling, and, transportation, however, opponents, such, as, the, humane, society, have, alleged, uep, certification, is, misleading, and, allows, a, significant, amount, of, unchecked, animal, cruelty, other, standards, include, cage, free, natural, certified, humane, and, certified, organic, of, these, standards, certified, humane, which, carries, requirements, for, stocking, density, and, cage, free, keeping, and, so, on, and, certified, organic, which, requires, hens, to, have, outdoor, access, and, to, be, fed, only, organic, vegetarian, feed, and, so, on, are, the, most, stringent, effective, 1, january, 2012, the, european, union, banned, conventional, battery, cages, for, egg, laying, hens, as, outlined, in, eu, directive, 1999, 74, ec, the, eu, permits, the, use, of, enriched, furnished, cages, that, must, meet, certain, space, and, amenity, requirements, egg, producers, in, many, member, states, have, objected, to, the, new, quality, standards, while, in, some, countries, even, furnished, cages, and, family, cages, are, subject, to, be, banned, as, well, the, production, standard, of, the, eggs, is, visible, on, a, mandatory, egg, marking, categorization, where, the, eu, egg, code, begins, with, 3, for, caged, chicken, to, 1, for, free, range, eggs, and, 0, for, organic, egg, production, in, all, methods, of, egg, production, unwanted, male, chicks, are, killed, at, birth, during, the, process, of, securing, a, further, generation, of, egg, laying, hens, as, of, june, 2023, this, practice, has, been, banned, in, germany, france, and, italy, some, egg, producers, have, adopted, in, ovo, sexing, which, first, became, available, in, 2018, as, of, september, 2023, five, companies, have, commercially, available, in, ovo, sexing, technology, which, is, used, for, 15, percent, of, the, european, layer, population, a, popular, easter, tradition, in, some, parts, of, the, world, is, a, decoration, of, hard, boiled, eggs, usually, by, dyeing, but, often, by, spray, painting, a, similar, tradition, of, egg, painting, exists, in, areas, of, the, world, influenced, by, the, culture, of, persia, before, the, spring, equinox, in, the, persian, new, year, tradition, called, norouz, each, family, member, decorates, a, hard, boiled, egg, and, they, set, them, together, in, a, bowl, in, the, new, testament, eggs, are, referred, to, as, an, example, of, the, kind, of, gift, a, child, might, request, from, their, father, and, which, would, not, be, denied, in, northern, europe, and, north, america, easter, eggs, may, be, hidden, by, adults, for, children, to, find, in, an, easter, egg, hunt, they, may, be, rolled, in, some, traditions, in, eastern, and, central, europe, and, parts, of, england, easter, eggs, may, be, tapped, against, each, other, to, see, whose, egg, breaks, first, since, the,
