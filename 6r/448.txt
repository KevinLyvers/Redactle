2020, covid, 19, crisis, with, the, australian, and, hong, kong, racing, jurisdictions, carrying, on, albeit, with, no, crowds, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, france, were, some, of, the, more, prominent, racing, bodies, to, either, postpone, or, cancel, all, events, there, are, many, types, of, horse, racing, including, different, breeds, of, horses, have, been, bred, to, excel, in, each, of, these, disciplines, breeds, that, are, used, for, flat, racing, include, the, thoroughbred, quarter, horse, arabian, paint, and, appaloosa, jump, racing, breeds, include, the, thoroughbred, and, aqps, in, harness, racing, standardbreds, are, used, in, australia, new, zealand, and, north, america, in, europe, russian, and, french, trotters, are, used, with, standardbreds, light, cold, blood, horses, such, as, finnhorses, and, scandinavian, coldblood, trotters, are, also, used, in, harness, racing, within, their, respective, geographical, areas, there, are, also, races, for, ponies, both, flat, and, jump, and, harness, racing, flat, racing, is, the, most, common, form, of, horse, racing, seen, worldwide, flat, racing, tracks, are, typically, oval, in, shape, and, are, generally, level, although, in, great, britain, and, ireland, there, is, much, greater, variation, including, figure, of, eight, tracks, like, windsor, and, tracks, with, often, severe, gradients, and, changes, of, camber, such, as, epsom, racecourse, track, surfaces, vary, with, turf, most, common, in, europe, and, dirt, more, common, in, north, america, and, asia, newly, designed, synthetic, surfaces, such, as, polytrack, or, tapeta, are, seen, at, some, tracks, individual, flat, races, are, run, over, distances, ranging, from, 440, yards, 400, m, to, more, than, four, miles, 6, 4, km, although, races, longer, than, two, miles, 3, 2, km, are, quite, rare, and, distances, between, five, and, twelve, furlongs, 1, 0, and, 2, 4, km, are, the, most, common, short, races, are, generally, referred, to, as, sprints, while, longer, races, are, known, as, routes, in, the, united, states, or, staying, races, in, europe, although, fast, acceleration, a, turn, of, foot, is, usually, required, to, win, either, type, of, race, in, general, sprints, are, seen, as, a, test, of, speed, while, long, distance, races, are, seen, as, a, test, of, stamina, the, most, prestigious, flat, races, in, the, world, such, as, the, prix, de, l, arc, de, triomphe, melbourne, cup, japan, cup, epsom, derby, kentucky, derby, and, dubai, world, cup, are, run, over, distances, in, the, middle, of, this, range, and, are, seen, as, tests, of, both, speed, and, stamina, to, some, extent, in, the, most, prestigious, races, horses, are, generally, allocated, the, same, weight, to, carry, for, fairness, with, allowances, given, to, younger, horses, and, female, horses, running, against, males, these, races, are, called, conditions, races, and, offer, the, biggest, purses, there, is, another, category, of, races, called, handicap, races, where, each, horse, is, assigned, a, different, weight, to, carry, based, on, its, ability, besides, the, weight, they, carry, horses, performance, can, also, be, influenced, by, position, relative, to, the, inside, barrier, sex, jockey, and, training, jump, or, jumps, racing, in, great, britain, and, ireland, is, known, as, national, hunt, racing, although, confusingly, national, hunt, racing, also, includes, flat, races, taking, place, at, jumps, meetings, these, are, known, as, national, hunt, flat, races, jump, racing, can, be, subdivided, into, steeplechasing, and, hurdling, according, to, the, type, and, size, of, obstacles, being, jumped, the, word, steeplechasing, can, also, refer, collectively, to, any, type, of, jump, race, in, certain, racing, jurisdictions, particularly, in, the, united, states, typically, horses, progress, to, bigger, obstacles, and, longer, distances, as, they, get, older, so, that, a, european, jumps, horse, will, tend, to, start, in, national, hunt, flat, races, as, a, juvenile, move, on, to, hurdling, after, a, year, or, so, and, then, if, thought, capable, move, on, to, steeplechasing, a, type, of, racing, where, horses, go, around, a, track, while, pulling, a, sulky, and, a, driver, behind, them, in, this, sport, standardbreds, are, used, these, horses, are, separated, into, two, categories, trotters, and, pacers, pacers, move, the, legs, on, each, side, of, their, body, in, tandem, while, trotters, move, their, diagonal, legs, together, the, latter, are, typically, faster, than, the, former, due, to, the, gaits, used, occasionally, a, horse, will, break, their, gait, into, an, actual, canter, or, gallop, this, could, cause, the, loss, of, a, race, or, even, a, disqualification, notable, races, include, the, hambletonian, and, the, breeder, s, crown, series, ridden, trot, races, are, more, common, in, places, such, as, europe, and, new, zealand, these, horses, are, trotters, who, race, on, the, flat, under, saddle, with, a, jockey, on, their, backs, the, length, of, an, endurance, race, varies, greatly, some, are, very, short, only, ten, miles, while, other, races, can, be, up, to, one, hundred, miles, there, are, a, few, races, that, are, even, longer, than, one, hundred, miles, and, last, multiple, days, these, different, lengths, of, races, are, divided, into, five, categories, pleasure, rides, 10, 20, miles, non, competitive, trail, rides, 21, 27, miles, competitive, trail, rides, 20, 45, miles, progressive, trail, rides, 25, 60, miles, and, endurance, rides, 40, 100, miles, in, one, day, up, to, 250, miles, 400, km, in, multiple, days, because, each, race, is, very, long, trails, of, natural, terrain, are, generally, used, contemporary, organized, endurance, racing, began, in, california, around, 1955, and, the, first, race, marked, the, beginning, of, the, tevis, cup, this, race, was, a, one, hundred, mile, one, day, long, ride, starting, in, squaw, valley, placer, county, and, ending, in, auburn, founded, in, 1972, the, american, endurance, ride, conference, was, the, united, states, first, national, endurance, riding, association, the, longest, endurance, race, in, the, world, is, the, mongol, derby, which, is, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, long, in, most, horse, races, entry, is, restricted, to, certain, breeds, that, is, the, horse, must, have, a, sire, father, and, a, dam, mother, who, are, studbook, approved, individuals, of, whatever, breed, is, racing, for, example, in, a, normal, harness, race, the, horse, s, sire, and, dam, must, both, be, pure, standardbreds, the, exception, to, this, is, in, quarter, horse, racing, where, an, appendix, quarter, horse, may, be, considered, eligible, to, race, against, standard, quarter, horses, the, designation, of, appendix, refers, to, the, addendum, section, or, appendix, of, the, official, quarter, horse, registry, an, appendix, quarter, horse, is, a, horse, that, has, either, one, quarter, horse, parent, and, one, parent, of, any, other, eligible, breed, such, as, thoroughbred, the, most, common, appendix, cross, two, parents, that, are, registered, appendix, quarter, horses, or, one, parent, that, is, a, quarter, horse, and, one, parent, that, is, an, appendix, quarter, horse, aqha, also, issues, a, racing, register, of, merit, which, allows, a, horse, to, race, on, quarter, horse, tracks, but, not, be, considered, a, quarter, horse, for, breeding, purposes, unless, other, requirements, are, met, a, stallion, who, has, won, many, races, may, be, put, up, to, stud, when, he, is, retired, artificial, insemination, and, embryo, transfer, technology, allowed, only, in, some, breeds, have, brought, changes, to, the, traditions, and, ease, of, breeding, pedigrees, of, stallions, are, recorded, in, various, books, and, websites, such, as, weatherbys, stallion, book, the, australian, stud, book, and, thoroughbred, heritage, there, are, three, founding, sires, that, all, thoroughbreds, can, trace, back, to, in, the, male, line, the, darley, arabian, the, godolphin, arabian, and, the, byerley, turk, named, after, their, respective, owners, thomas, darley, lord, godolphin, and, captain, robert, byerly, they, were, taken, to, england, where, they, were, bred, with, mares, from, english, and, imported, bloodlines, the, resultant, foals, were, the, first, generation, of, thoroughbreds, and, all, modern, thoroughbreds, are, their, descents, thoroughbreds, range, in, height, which, is, measured, in, hands, a, hand, being, four, inches, some, are, as, small, as, 15, hands, while, others, are, over, 17, thoroughbreds, can, travel, medium, distances, at, fast, paces, requiring, a, balance, between, speed, and, endurance, thoroughbreds, may, be, bay, black, dark, bay, brown, chestnut, gray, roan, white, or, palomino, artificial, insemination, cloning, and, embryo, transfer, are, not, allowed, in, the, thoroughbred, breed, the, standardbred, is, a, breed, of, horse, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, but, they, are, largely, bred, for, harness, racing, they, are, descended, from, thoroughbreds, morgans, and, extinct, breeds, standardbreds, are, typically, docile, and, easy, to, handle, they, do, not, spook, easily, and, are, quite, versatile, in, what, they, can, do, they, can, be, jumpers, dressage, and, pleasure, riding, horses, the, arabian, horse, was, developed, by, the, bedouin, people, of, the, west, asia, specifically, for, stamina, over, long, distances, so, they, could, outrun, their, enemies, it, was, not, until, 1725, that, the, first, arabians, was, brought, to, north, america, and, not, until, about, the, time, of, the, civil, war, that, they, were, bred, as, purebreds, until, the, formation, of, the, arabian, horse, registry, of, america, in, 1908, arabians, were, recorded, with, the, jockey, club, in, a, separate, subsection, from, thoroughbreds, arabians, must, be, able, to, withstand, traveling, long, distances, at, a, moderate, pace, they, have, an, abundance, of, type, i, muscle, fibers, enabling, their, muscles, to, work, for, extended, periods, of, time, also, the, muscles, of, the, arabian, are, not, nearly, as, massive, as, those, of, the, quarter, horse, which, allow, it, to, travel, longer, distances, at, quicker, speeds, the, arabian, is, primarily, used, today, in, endurance, racing, but, is, also, raced, over, traditional, race, tracks, in, many, countries, arabian, horse, racing, is, governed, by, the, international, federation, of, arabian, horse, racing, the, ancestors, of, the, quarter, horse, were, prevalent, in, america, in, the, early, 17th, century, these, horses, were, a, blend, of, colonial, spanish, horses, crossed, with, english, horses, that, were, brought, over, in, the, 1700s, the, native, horse, and, the, english, horse, were, bred, together, resulting, in, a, compact, muscular, horse, at, this, time, they, were, mainly, used, for, chores, such, as, plowing, and, cattle, work, the, american, quarter, horse, was, not, recognized, as, an, official, breed, until, the, formation, of, the, american, quarter, horse, association, in, 1940, in, order, to, be, successful, in, racing, quarter, horses, need, to, be, able, to, propel, themselves, forward, at, extremely, fast, sprinter, speed, the, quarter, horse, has, much, larger, hind, limb, muscles, than, the, arabian, which, make, it, less, suitable, for, endurance, racing, it, also, has, more, type, ii, b, muscle, fibers, which, allow, the, quarter, horse, to, accelerate, rapidly, when, quarter, horse, racing, began, it, was, very, expensive, to, lay, a, full, mile, of, track, so, it, was, agreed, that, a, straight, track, of, four, hundred, meters, or, one, quarter, of, a, mile, would, be, laid, instead, it, became, the, standard, racing, distance, for, quarter, horses, and, inspired, their, name, with, the, exception, of, the, longer, 870, yard, 800, m, distance, contests, quarter, horse, races, are, run, flat, out, with, the, horses, running, at, top, speed, for, the, duration, there, is, less, jockeying, for, position, as, turns, are, rare, and, many, races, end, with, several, contestants, grouped, together, at, the, wire, the, track, surface, is, similar, to, that, of, thoroughbred, racing, and, usually, consists, of, dirt, in, addition, to, the, three, main, racing, breeds, above, and, their, crosses, horse, racing, may, be, conducted, using, various, other, breeds, appaloosa, american, paint, horse, selle, fran, ais, aqps, and, korean, jeju, muscles, are, bundles, of, contractile, fibers, that, are, attached, to, bones, by, tendons, these, bundles, have, different, types, of, fibers, within, them, and, horses, have, adapted, over, the, years, to, produce, different, amounts, of, these, fibers, type, i, muscle, fibers, are, adapted, for, aerobic, exercise, and, rely, on, the, presence, of, oxygen, they, are, slow, twitch, fibers, they, allow, muscles, to, work, for, longer, periods, of, time, resulting, in, greater, endurance, type, ii, muscles, are, adapted, for, anaerobic, exercise, because, they, can, function, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, type, ii, a, fibers, are, intermediate, representing, a, balance, between, the, fast, twitch, fibers, and, the, slow, twitch, fibers, they, allow, the, muscles, to, generate, both, speed, and, endurance, thoroughbreds, possess, more, type, ii, a, muscle, fibers, than, quarter, horses, or, arabians, this, type, of, fiber, allows, them, to, propel, themselves, forward, at, great, speeds, and, maintain, it, for, an, extended, distance, type, ii, b, fibers, are, fast, twitch, fibers, these, fibers, allow, muscles, to, contract, quickly, resulting, in, a, great, deal, of, power, and, speed, the, conditioning, program, for, the, horses, varies, depending, on, the, race, length, genetics, training, age, and, skeletal, soundness, are, all, factors, that, contribute, to, a, horse, s, performance, the, muscle, structure, and, fiber, type, of, horses, depends, on, the, breed, therefore, genetics, must, be, considered, when, constructing, a, conditioning, plan, a, horse, s, fitness, plan, must, be, coordinated, properly, in, order, to, prevent, injury, or, lameness, if, these, are, to, occur, they, may, negatively, affect, a, horse, s, willingness, to, learn, sprinting, exercises, are, appropriate, for, training, two, year, old, racehorses, but, the, number, is, limited, by, psychological, factors, as, well, as, physical, a, horse, s, skeletal, system, adapts, to, the, exercise, it, receives, because, the, skeletal, system, does, not, reach, full, maturity, until, the, horse, is, at, least, six, years, of, age, young, racehorses, often, suffer, injuries, in, the, united, states, thoroughbred, flat, races, are, run, on, surfaces, of, either, dirt, synthetic, or, turf, other, tracks, offer, quarter, horse, racing, and, standardbred, racing, on, combinations, of, these, three, types, of, racing, surfaces, racing, of, other, breeds, such, as, arabian, horse, racing, is, found, on, a, limited, basis, american, thoroughbred, races, are, run, at, a, wide, variety, of, distances, most, commonly, from, 5, to, 12, furlongs, 0, 63, to, 1, 50, mi, 1, 0, to, 2, 4, km, with, this, in, mind, breeders, of, thoroughbred, race, horses, attempt, to, breed, horses, that, excel, at, a, particular, distance, see, dosage, index, horse, racing, in, the, united, states, and, on, the, north, american, continent, dates, back, to, 1665, which, saw, the, establishment, of, the, newmarket, course, in, salisbury, new, york, a, section, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, hempstead, plains, of,
