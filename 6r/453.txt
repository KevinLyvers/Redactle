mountaineering, mountain, climbing, or, alpinism, is, a, set, of, outdoor, activities, that, involves, ascending, mountains, mountaineering, related, activities, include, traditional, outdoor, climbing, skiing, and, traversing, via, ferratas, that, have, become, sports, in, their, own, right, indoor, climbing, sport, climbing, and, bouldering, are, also, considered, variants, of, mountaineering, by, some, but, are, part, of, a, wide, group, of, mountain, sports, unlike, most, sports, mountaineering, lacks, widely, applied, formal, rules, regulations, and, governance, mountaineers, adhere, to, a, large, variety, of, techniques, and, philosophies, including, grading, and, guidebooks, when, climbing, mountains, numerous, local, alpine, clubs, support, mountaineers, by, hosting, resources, and, social, activities, a, federation, of, alpine, clubs, the, international, climbing, and, mountaineering, federation, uiaa, is, the, international, olympic, committee, recognized, world, organization, for, mountaineering, and, climbing, the, consequences, of, mountaineering, on, the, natural, environment, can, be, seen, in, terms, of, individual, components, of, the, environment, land, relief, soil, vegetation, fauna, and, landscape, and, the, location, zone, of, mountaineering, activity, hiking, trekking, or, climbing, zone, mountaineering, impacts, communities, on, economic, political, social, and, cultural, levels, often, leading, to, changes, in, people, s, worldviews, influenced, by, globalization, specifically, foreign, cultures, and, lifestyles, humans, have, been, present, in, mountains, since, prehistory, the, remains, of, tzi, who, lived, in, the, 4th, millennium, bc, were, found, in, a, glacier, in, the, tztal, alps, however, the, highest, mountains, were, rarely, visited, early, on, and, were, often, associated, with, supernatural, or, religious, concepts, nonetheless, there, are, many, documented, examples, of, people, climbing, mountains, prior, to, the, formal, development, of, the, sport, in, the, 19th, century, although, many, of, these, stories, are, sometimes, considered, fictional, or, legendary, the, famous, poet, petrarch, describes, his, 26, april, 1336, ascent, of, mount, ventoux, 1, 912, m, 6, 273, ft, in, one, of, his, epistolae, familiares, claiming, to, be, inspired, by, philip, v, of, macedon, s, ascent, of, mount, haemo, for, most, of, antiquity, climbing, mountains, was, a, practical, or, symbolic, activity, usually, undertaken, for, economic, political, or, religious, purposes, a, commonly, cited, example, is, the, 1492, ascent, of, mont, aiguille, 2, 085, m, 6, 841, ft, by, antoine, de, ville, a, french, military, officer, and, lord, of, domjulien, and, beaupr, because, ropes, ladders, and, iron, hooks, were, used, and, because, it, was, the, first, climb, of, any, technical, difficulty, to, be, officially, verified, this, ascent, is, widely, recognized, as, being, the, birth, of, mountaineering, conrad, gessner, a, mid, 16th, century, physician, botanist, and, naturalist, from, switzerland, is, widely, recognized, as, being, the, first, person, to, hike, and, climb, for, sheer, pleasure, in, the, andes, around, the, late, 1400s, and, early, 1500s, many, ascents, were, made, of, extremely, high, peaks, by, the, incas, and, their, subjects, the, highest, they, are, known, for, certain, to, have, climbed, is, 6739, m, at, the, summit, of, volcan, llullaillaco, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, the, romantic, era, marked, a, change, of, attitudes, towards, high, mountains, in, 1757, swiss, scientist, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, made, the, first, of, several, unsuccessful, attempts, on, mont, blanc, in, france, he, then, offered, a, reward, to, anyone, who, could, climb, the, mountain, which, was, claimed, in, 1786, by, jacques, balmat, and, michel, gabriel, paccard, the, climb, is, usually, considered, an, epochal, event, in, the, history, of, mountaineering, a, symbolic, mark, of, the, birth, of, the, sport, by, the, early, 19th, century, many, of, the, alpine, peaks, were, reached, including, the, grossglockner, in, 1800, the, ortler, in, 1804, the, jungfrau, in, 1811, the, finsteraarhorn, in, 1812, and, the, breithorn, in, 1813, in, 1808, marie, paradis, became, the, first, woman, to, climb, mont, blanc, followed, in, 1838, by, henriette, d, angeville, the, beginning, of, mountaineering, as, a, sport, in, the, uk, is, generally, dated, to, the, ascent, of, the, wetterhorn, in, 1854, by, english, mountaineer, sir, alfred, wills, who, made, mountaineering, fashionable, in, britain, this, inaugurated, what, became, known, as, the, golden, age, of, alpinism, with, the, first, mountaineering, club, the, alpine, club, being, founded, in, 1857, one, of, the, most, dramatic, events, was, the, spectacular, first, ascent, of, the, matterhorn, in, 1865, by, a, party, led, by, english, illustrator, edward, whymper, in, which, four, of, the, party, members, fell, to, their, deaths, by, this, point, the, sport, of, mountaineering, had, largely, reached, its, modern, form, with, a, large, body, of, professional, guides, equipment, and, methodologies, in, the, early, years, of, the, golden, age, scientific, pursuits, were, intermixed, with, the, sport, such, as, by, the, physicist, john, tyndall, in, the, later, years, it, shifted, to, a, more, competitive, orientation, as, pure, sportsmen, came, to, dominate, the, london, based, alpine, club, and, alpine, mountaineering, overall, the, first, president, of, the, alpine, club, john, ball, is, considered, to, be, the, discoverer, of, the, dolomites, which, for, decades, were, the, focus, of, climbers, like, paul, grohmann, and, angelo, dibona, at, that, time, the, edelweiss, also, established, itself, as, a, symbol, of, alpinists, and, mountaineers, in, the, 19th, century, the, focus, of, mountaineering, turned, towards, mountains, beyond, the, alps, one, of, the, earliest, mountain, areas, to, be, explored, beyond, the, alps, in, the, 19th, century, were, the, mountains, of, norway, particularly, jotunheimen, where, british, mountaineers, such, as, william, cecil, slingsby, harold, raeburn, and, howard, priestman, were, early, pioneers, slingsby, s, book, norway, the, northern, playground, contributed, greatly, to, the, popularization, of, mountaineering, in, norway, among, the, international, mountaineering, community, around, the, turn, of, the, century, a, young, generation, of, norwegian, mountaineers, such, as, george, paus, eilert, sundt, and, kristian, tandberg, appeared, and, later, founded, norsk, tindeklub, the, third, oldest, mountaineering, association, in, the, world, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, mountaineering, had, acquired, a, more, international, flavour, in, 1897, mount, saint, elias, 18, 008, ft, 5, 489, m, on, the, alaska, yukon, border, was, summitted, by, the, duke, of, the, abruzzi, and, party, in, 1879, 1880, the, exploration, of, the, highest, andes, in, south, america, began, when, english, mountaineer, edward, whymper, climbed, chimborazo, 20, 549, ft, 6, 263, m, and, explored, the, mountains, of, ecuador, it, took, until, the, late, 19th, century, for, european, explorers, to, penetrate, africa, mount, kilimanjaro, in, africa, was, climbed, in, 1889, by, austrian, mountaineer, ludwig, purtscheller, and, german, geologist, hans, meyer, mount, kenya, in, 1899, by, halford, mackinder, the, last, and, greatest, mountain, range, to, be, conquered, was, the, himalayas, in, south, asia, they, had, initially, been, surveyed, by, the, british, empire, for, military, and, strategic, reasons, in, 1892, sir, william, martin, conway, explored, the, karakoram, himalayas, and, climbed, a, peak, of, 23, 000, ft, 7, 000, m, in, 1895, albert, f, mummery, died, while, attempting, nanga, parbat, while, in, 1899, douglas, freshfield, took, an, expedition, to, the, snowy, regions, of, sikkim, in, 1899, 1903, 1906, and, 1908, american, mountaineer, fanny, bullock, workman, one, of, the, first, professional, female, mountaineers, made, ascents, in, the, himalayas, including, one, of, the, nun, kun, peaks, 23, 300, ft, 7, 100, m, a, number, of, gurkha, sepoys, were, trained, as, expert, mountaineers, by, charles, granville, bruce, and, a, good, deal, of, exploration, was, accomplished, by, them, in, 1902, the, eckenstein, crowley, expedition, led, by, english, mountaineer, oscar, eckenstein, and, english, occultist, aleister, crowley, was, the, first, to, attempt, to, scale, k2, they, reached, 22, 000, feet, 6, 700, m, before, turning, back, due, to, weather, and, other, mishaps, undaunted, in, 1905, crowley, led, the, first, expedition, to, kangchenjunga, the, third, highest, mountain, in, the, world, in, an, attempt, which, isserman, angas, weaver, and, molenaar, describe, as, misguided, and, lamentable, due, to, crowley, s, many, failings, as, an, expedition, leader, eckenstein, was, also, a, pioneer, in, developing, new, equipment, and, climbing, methods, he, started, using, shorter, ice, axes, that, could, be, used, single, handedly, designed, the, modern, crampons, and, improved, on, the, nail, patterns, used, for, the, climbing, boots, by, the, 1950s, all, the, eight, thousanders, but, two, had, been, climbed, starting, with, annapurna, in, 1950, by, maurice, herzog, and, louis, lachenal, on, the, 1950, french, annapurna, expedition, the, highest, of, these, peaks, mount, everest, was, climbed, in, 1953, after, the, british, had, made, several, attempts, in, the, 1920s, the, 1922, expedition, reached, 8, 320, metres, 27, 300, ft, before, being, aborted, on, the, third, summit, attempt, after, an, avalanche, killed, seven, porters, the, 1924, expedition, saw, another, height, record, achieved, but, still, failed, to, reach, the, summit, with, confirmation, when, george, mallory, and, andrew, irvine, disappeared, on, the, final, attempt, the, summit, was, finally, reached, on, 29, may, 1953, by, sir, edmund, hillary, and, tenzing, norgay, from, the, south, side, in, nepal, just, a, few, months, later, hermann, buhl, made, the, first, ascent, of, nanga, parbat, 8, 125, m, on, the, 1953, german, austrian, nanga, parbat, expedition, completing, the, last, 1, 300, meters, walking, alone, self, medicating, with, pervitin, based, on, the, stimulant, methamphetamine, used, by, soldiers, during, world, war, ii, the, vasodilator, padutin, and, a, stimulant, tea, made, from, coca, leaves, k2, 8, 611m, the, second, highest, peak, in, the, world, was, first, scaled, in, 1954, by, lino, lacedelli, and, achille, compagnoni, in, 1964, the, final, eight, thousander, to, be, climbed, was, shishapangma, 8, 013m, the, lowest, of, all, the, 8, 000, metre, peaks, reinhold, messner, from, the, dolomites, mountain, range, italy, was, then, the, first, to, climb, all, eight, thousanders, up, to, 1986, in, addition, to, being, the, first, without, supplemental, oxygen, in, 1978, he, climbed, mount, everest, with, peter, habeler, without, supplemental, oxygen, the, first, men, to, do, so, long, the, domain, of, the, wealthy, elite, and, their, agents, the, emergence, of, the, middle, class, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, resulted, in, mass, interest, in, mountaineering, it, became, a, popular, pastime, and, hobby, of, many, people, some, have, come, to, criticize, the, sport, as, becoming, too, much, of, a, tourist, activity, there, are, different, activities, associated, with, the, sport, mountaineering, lacks, formal, rules, though, appropriately, empowered, bodies, make, many, pertaining, to, specific, use, of, mountains, and, practices, on, them, in, theory, any, person, may, climb, a, mountain, and, call, themself, a, mountaineer, in, practice, the, sport, is, defined, by, the, safe, and, necessary, use, of, technical, skills, in, mountainous, terrain, in, particular, roped, climbing, and, snow, travel, abilities, a, variety, of, techniques, have, been, developed, to, help, people, climb, mountains, that, are, widely, applied, among, practitioners, of, the, sport, despite, its, lack, of, defined, rules, and, non, competitive, nature, certain, aspects, of, mountaineering, have, much, of, the, trappings, of, an, organized, sport, with, recognition, of, specific, climbing, activities, including, climbing, wall, based, competition, by, the, international, olympic, committee, on, a, club, level, the, prominent, international, sport, federation, the, uiaa, counts, numerous, national, alpine, clubs, as, its, members, while, others, such, as, the, mountaineers, and, the, french, federation, of, mountaineering, and, climbing, remain, independent, the, premier, award, in, mountaineering, is, the, privately, granted, piolet, d, or, which, has, expanded, from, a, single, recognition, to, multiple, while, there, are, many, competitions, particularly, in, toproped, climbing, wall, disciplines, there, are, no, official, world, championships, or, other, similar, competitions, for, mountaineering, broadly, mountaineering, techniques, vary, greatly, depending, on, location, season, terrain, and, route, both, techniques, and, hazards, vary, by, terrain, spanning, trails, rock, snow, and, ice, mountaineers, must, possess, adequate, food, water, information, equipment, stamina, and, skill, to, complete, their, tasks, the, term, walk, up, or, trek, is, used, to, describe, terrain, in, which, no, technical, equipment, is, needed, to, traverse, this, terrain, mountaineers, hike, long, distances, to, a, base, camp, or, the, beginning, of, rough, terrain, either, following, trails, or, using, navigation, techniques, to, travel, cross, country, hiking, may, be, a, strenuous, activity, and, adequate, physical, fitness, and, familiarity, with, the, wilderness, is, necessary, to, complete, a, hike, it, is, also, a, prerequisite, of, success, in, all, aspects, of, mountaineering, alpine, rock, climbing, involves, technical, skills, including, the, ability, to, place, anchors, into, the, rock, to, safely, ascend, a, mountain, in, some, cases, climbers, may, have, to, climb, multiple, pitches, of, rock, to, reach, the, top, typically, for, any, one, pitch, there, is, a, belayer, who, is, stationary, and, creates, tension, on, the, rope, to, catch, a, climber, should, he, or, she, fall, and, a, climber, who, ascends, the, rock, the, first, climber, called, the, leader, will, reach, a, point, on, the, rock, and, then, build, an, anchor, which, will, secure, subsequent, climbers, anchors, could, be, created, by, using, slings, around, a, tree, or, boulder, or, by, using, protection, devices, like, cams, and, nuts, once, anchored, the, leader, will, then, belay, the, climber, coming, up, from, below, once, the, follower, reaches, the, leader, the, leader, will, often, transfer, all, necessary, protection, devices, known, as, a, rack, to, the, follower, the, follower, then, becomes, the, leader, and, will, ascend, the, next, pitch, this, process, will, continue, until, the, climbers, either, reach, the, top, or, run, into, different, terrain, for, extremely, vertical, rocks, or, to, overcome, certain, logistical, challenges, climbers, may, use, aid, climbing, techniques, this, involves, the, use, of, equipment, such, as, ladders, fixed, lines, and, ascenders, to, help, the, climber, push, themself, up, the, rock, in, alpine, climbing, it, is, common, for, climbers, to, see, routes, of, mixed, terrain, this, means, climbers, may, need, to, move, efficiently, from, climbing, glacier, to, rock, to, ice, back, and, forth, in, a, number, of, variations, compacted, snow, conditions, allow, mountaineers, to, progress, on, foot, frequently, crampons, are, required, to, travel, efficiently, and, safely, over, snow, and, ice, crampons, attach, to, the, bottom, of, a, mountaineer, s, boots, and, provide, additional, traction, on, hard, snow, and, ice, for, loose, snow, crampons, are, less, suitable, and, snowshoes, or, skis, may, be, preferred, using, various, techniques, from, alpine, skiing, to, ascend, descend, a, mountain, is, a, form, of, the, sport, by, itself, called, ski, mountaineering, ascending, and, descending, a, steep, snow, slope, safely, requires, the, use, of, an, ice, axe, and, different, footwork, techniques, that, have, been, developed, over, the, past, century, such, as, the, french, technique, and, german, technique, teams, of, climbers, may, choose, to, attach, everyone, together, with, a, rope, to, form, a, rope, team, the, team, may, then, secure, themselves, by, attaching, the, rope, to, anchors, these, anchors, are, sometimes, unreliable, and, include, snow, stakes, or, pickets, deadman, devices, called, flukes, or, buried, equipment, or, rocks, bollards, which, are, simply, carved, out, of, consolidated, snow, or, ice, also, sometimes, serve, as, anchors, alternatively, a, roped, team, may, choose, not, to, use, anchors, instead, all, members, of, the, team, will, prepare, to, use, their, ice, axes, to, self, arrest, in, the, event, should, a, team, member, fall, it, is, not, always, wise, for, climbers, to, form, a, rope, team, since, one, falling, climber, may, pull, the, entire, team, off, the, mountain, however, the, risks, of, individual, unprotected, travel, are, often, so, great, that, groups, have, no, choice, but, to, form, a, rope, team, for, example, when, traveling, over, glaciers, crevasses, pose, a, grave, danger, to, a, climber, who, is, not, roped, in, these, giant, cracks, in, the, ice, are, not, always, visible, as, snow, can, be, blown, and, freeze, over, the, top, to, make, a, snowbridge, at, times, snowbridges, can, be, as, thin, as, a, few, inches, and, may, collapse, from, people, walking, over, them, should, a, climber, fall, being, protected, by, a, rope, greatly, reduces, the, risk, of, injury, or, death, the, other, members, of, the, rope, team, may, proceed, with, a, crevasse, rescue, to, pull, the, fallen, climber, from, the, crevasse, for, extremely, slippery, or, steep, snow, ice, and, mixed, rock, and, ice, terrain, climbers, must, use, more, advanced, techniques, called, ice, climbing, or, mixed, climbing, specialized, tools, such, as, ice, screws, and, ice, picks, help, climbers, build, anchors, and, move, up, the, ice, as, well, as, traditional, rock, climbing, equipment, for, anchoring, in, mixed, terrain, often, mountaineers, climbing, steep, snow, or, mixed, snowy, rock, terrain, will, not, use, a, fixed, belay, instead, each, climber, on, the, team, will, climb, at, the, same, time, while, attached, to, anchors, in, groups, of, two, this, allows, for, safety, should, the, entire, team, be, taken, off, their, feet, which, also, allows, for, greater, speed, than, the, traditional, technique, of, belaying, one, climber, at, a, time, this, technique, is, known, as, simul, climbing, or, a, running, belay, and, is, sometimes, also, used, on, ice, however, the, risk, of, dropping, frequently, displaced, ice, on, the, lower, team, member, s, limits, its, usefulness, on, ice, traditional, belays, are, also, used, in, this, case, this, is, sometimes, necessary, due, to, ice, fall, hazard, steepness, or, other, factors, climbers, use, a, few, different, forms, of, shelter, depending, on, the, situation, and, conditions, alpine, shelters, or, arctic, shelters, shelter, is, a, very, important, aspect, of, safety, for, the, climber, as, weather, in, the, mountains, may, be, very, unpredictable, tall, mountains, may, require, many, days, of, camping, short, trips, lasting, less, than, a, day, generally, do, not, require, shelter, although, for, safety, most, mountaineers, will, carry, an, emergency, shelter, such, a, light, bivouac, sack, typical, shelters, used, for, camping, include, tents, and, bivouac, sacks, the, ability, of, these, shelters, to, provide, protection, from, the, elements, is, dependent, on, their, design, mountaineers, who, climb, in, areas, with, cold, weather, or, snow, and, ice, will, use, more, heavy, duty, shelters, than, those, who, climb, in, more, forgiving, environments, in, remote, locations, mountaineers, will, set, up, a, base, camp, which, is, an, area, used, for, staging, attempts, at, nearby, summits, base, camps, are, positioned, to, be, relatively, safe, from, harsh, terrain, and, weather, where, the, summit, cannot, be, reached, from, base, camp, in, a, single, day, a, mountain, will, have, additional, camps, above, base, camp, for, popular, mountains, base, camps, may, be, at, a, fixed, location, and, become, famous, the, everest, base, camps, and, camp, muir, are, among, the, most, famous, base, camps, camping, is, not, always, an, option, or, may, not, be, suitable, if, a, mountain, is, close, to, civilization, some, regions, may, legally, prohibit, primitive, camping, due, to, concern, for, the, environment, or, due, to, issues, with, crowds, in, lieu, of, camping, mountaineers, may, choose, to, stay, in, mountain, huts, the, european, alpine, regions, in, particular, have, a, large, network, of, huts, such, huts, exist, at, many, different, heights, including, in, the, high, mountains, themselves, in, extremely, remote, areas, more, rudimentary, shelters, may, exist, the, mountain, huts, are, of, varying, size, and, quality, but, each, is, typically, centred, on, a, communal, dining, room, and, have, dormitories, equipped, with, mattresses, blankets, or, duvets, and, pillows, guests, are, expected, to, bring, and, use, their, own, sleeping, bag, liners, the, facilities, are, usually, rudimentary, but, given, their, locations, huts, offer, vital, shelter, make, routes, more, widely, accessible, by, allowing, journeys, to, be, broken, and, reducing, the, weight, of, equipment, needing, to, be, carried, and, offer, good, value, in, europe, all, huts, are, staffed, during, the, summer, mid, june, to, mid, september, and, some, are, staffed, in, the, spring, mid, march, to, mid, may, elsewhere, huts, may, also, be, open, in, the, fall, huts, also, may, have, a, part, that, is, always, open, but, unstaffed, a, so, called, winter, hut, when, open, and, staffed, the, huts, are, generally, run, by, full, time, employees, but, some, are, staffed, on, a, voluntary, basis, by, members, of, alpine, clubs, the, manager, of, the, hut, termed, a, guardian, or, warden, in, europe, will, usually, also, sell, refreshments, and, meals, both, to, those, visiting, only, for, the, day, and, to, those, staying, overnight, the, offering, is, surprisingly, wide, given, that, most, supplies, often, including, fresh, water, must, be, flown, in, by, helicopter, and, may, include, glucose, based, snacks, such, as, candy, bars, on, which, climbers, and, walkers, wish, to, stock, up, cakes, and, pastries, made, at, the, hut, a, variety, of, hot, and, cold, drinks, including, beer, and, wine, and, high, carbohydrate, dinners, in, the, evenings, not, all, huts, offer, a, catered, service, though, and, visitors, may, need, to, provide, for, themselves, some, huts, offer, facilities, for, both, enabling, visitors, wishing, to, keep, costs, down, to, bring, their, own, food, and, cooking, equipment, and, to, cater, using, the, facilities, provided, booking, for, overnight, stays, at, huts, is, deemed, obligatory, and, in, many, cases, is, essential, as, some, popular, huts, even, with, more, than, 100, bed, spaces, may, be, full, during, good, weather, and, at, weekends, once, made, the, cancellation, of, a, reservation, is, advised, as, a, matter, of, courtesy, and, indeed, potentially, of, safety, as, many, huts, keep, a, record, of, where, climbers, and, walkers, state, they, plan, to, walk, to, next, most, huts, may, be, contacted, by, telephone, and, most, take, credit, cards, as, a, means, of, payment, in, the, uk, the, term, hut, is, used, for, any, cottage, or, cabin, used, as, a, base, for, walkers, or, climbers, these, are, mostly, owned, by, mountaineering, clubs, for, use, by, members, or, visiting, clubs, and, generally, do, not, have, wardens, or, permanent, staff, but, have, cooking, and, washing, facilities, and, heating, in, the, scottish, highlands, small, simple, unstaffed, shelters, without, cooking, facilities, known, as, bothies, are, maintained, to, break, up, cross, country, long, routes, and, act, as, base, camps, to, certain, mountains, where, conditions, permit, snow, caves, are, another, way, to, shelter, high, on, the, mountain, some, climbers, do, not, use, tents, at, high, altitudes, unless, the, snow, conditions, do, not, allow, for, snow, caving, since, snow, caves, are, silent, and, much, warmer, than, tents, they, can, be, built, relatively, easily, given, sufficient, time, using, a, snow, shovel, the, temperature, of, a, correctly, made, snow, cave, will, hover, around, freezing, which, relative, to, outside, temperatures, can, be, very, warm, they, can, be, dug, anywhere, where, there, is, at, least, four, feet, of, snow, the, addition, of, a, good, quality, bivouac, bag, and, closed, cell, foam, sleeping, mat, will, also, increase, the, warmth, of, the, snow, cave, another, shelter, that, works, well, is, a, quinzee, which, is, excavated, from, a, pile, of, snow, that, has, been, work, hardened, or, sintered, typically, by, stomping, igloos, are, used, by, some, climbers, but, are, deceptively, difficult, to, build, and, require, specific, snow, conditions, mountaineers, face, a, variety, of, hazards, when, climbing, mountains, there, are, two, types, of, hazards, objective, mountain, based, and, subjective, human, based, objective, hazards, relate, to, the, environment, and, may, include, inclement, weather, conditions, dangerous, terrain, duration, of, exposure, and, other, environmental, conditions, subjective, hazards, relate, to, a, climber, s, poor, judgement, poor, planning, lack, of, skills, faulty, analysis, and, conclusions, or, inadequate, conditioning, in, terms, of, objective, hazards, the, dangers, mountaineers, face, include, loose, or, falling, rocks, falling, ice, snow, avalanches, the, climber, falling, falls, from, ice, slopes, falls, down, snow, slopes, falls, into, crevasses, and, the, dangers, from, altitude, and, weather, from, 1947, to, 2018, in, the, united, states, 2, 799, people, were, reported, to, be, involved, in, mountaineering, accidents, and, 43, of, these, accidents, resulted, in, death, climbers, themselves, are, responsible, for, nearly, all, climbing, accidents, when, planning, and, preparing, for, a, trip, safe, climbers, know, what, hazards, to, look, for, and, how, to, recognize, them, in, situations, where, hazards, are, not, able, to, be, avoided, the, climber, must, use, their, decision, making, skills, to, mitigate, those, hazards, climbers, improve, upon, their, ability, to, become, a, safe, decision, maker, and, recognize, hazards, by, receiving, proper, education, training, practice, and, experience, as, well, as, learning, how, to, spot, personal, bias, rapid, ascent, can, lead, to, altitude, sickness, the, best, treatment, is, to, descend, immediately, the, climber, s, motto, at, high, altitude, is, climb, high, sleep, low, referring, to, the, regimen, of, climbing, higher, to, acclimatise, but, returning, to, lower, elevation, to, sleep, in, the, andes, the, chewing, of, coca, leaves, has, been, traditionally, used, to, treat, altitude, sickness, symptoms, common, symptoms, of, altitude, sickness, include, severe, headache, sleep, problems, nausea, lack, of, appetite, lethargy, and, body, ache, mountain, sickness, may, progress, to, hace, high, altitude, cerebral, edema, and, hape, high, altitude, pulmonary, edema, both, of, which, can, be, fatal, within, 24, hours, in, high, mountains, atmospheric, pressure, is, lower, and, this, means, that, less, oxygen, is, available, to, breathe, this, is, the, underlying, cause, of, altitude, sickness, everyone, needs, to, acclimatise, even, exceptional, mountaineers, that, have, been, to, high, altitude, before, generally, speaking, mountaineers, start, using, bottled, oxygen, when, they, climb, above, 7, 000, m, exceptional, mountaineers, have, climbed, 8000, metre, peaks, including, everest, without, oxygen, almost, always, with, a, carefully, planned, program, of, acclimatisation, exposure, to, hot, environments, or, activities, involving, exertion, cause, heat, to, build, up, in, the, body, a, heat, related, illness, can, occur, when, the, body, is, unable, to, lose, that, heat, through, the, skin, problems, that, can, arise, from, this, type, of, exposure, include, heat, cramps, heat, exhaustion, and, heat, stroke, common, symptoms, of, heat, exhaustion, include, headaches, cool, and, clammy, skin, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, thirst, and, rapid, pulse, the, best, treatment, is, resting, with, feet, elevated, replenishing, fluids, and, removing, excess, clothing, common, symptoms, of, heat, stroke, can, be, an, altered, state, of, mind, rapid, pulse, and, respiratory, rate, headache, hot, skin, loss, of, coordination, and, possible, seizures, this, is, a, life, threatening, illness, that, must, be, dealt, with, right, away, while, mountaineering, snow, and, ice, can, be, used, to, cool, the, body, and, head, in, certain, environmental, conditions, body, heat, can, be, lost, due, to, evaporation, radiation, convection, and, conduction, a, cold, related, illness, can, occur, when, that, body, heat, is, lost, problems, that, can, arise, from, the, cold, include, wind, chill, hypothermia, frost, nip, frostbite, and, immersion, foot, the, best, treatment, for, hypothermia, is, to, deal, with, it, before, it, occurs, using, preventative, measures, instead, of, waiting, for, symptoms, to, appear, mountaineering, requires, a, slower, pace, to, avoid, sweating, and, fatigue, that, could, lead, to, these, dangerous, conditions, other, tips, for, preventing, hypothermia, include, staying, well, fed, and, hydrated, putting, on, more, clothes, when, feeling, cold, and, wearing, adequate, equipment, to, keep, warm, and, dry, there, are, two, main, styles, of, mountaineering, expedition, style, and, alpine, style, the, alpine, style, contrasts, with, expedition, style, with, this, style, climbers, will, carry, large, amounts, of, equipment, and, provisions, up, and, down, the, mountain, slowly, making, upward, progress, climbing, in, an, expedition, style, is, preferred, if, the, summit, is, very, high, or, distant, from, civilization, mountaineers, who, use, this, style, are, usually, but, not, always, part, of, a, large, team, of, climbers, and, support, staff, such, as, porters, and, guides, to, cover, large, distances, with, their, massive, amounts, of, gear, sleds, and, pack, animals, are, commonly, used, climbers, will, set, up, multiple, camps, along, the, mountain, and, will, haul, their, gear, up, the, mountain, multiple, times, returning, to, a, lower, camp, after, each, haul, until, all, the, gear, is, at, a, higher, camp, and, repeating, this, procedure, until, they, reach, the, summit, this, technique, is, also, helpful, for, acclimatization, while, it, is, the, original, style, in, which, high, mountains, were, climbed, expedition, style, is, rare, these, days, as, more, mountains, have, become, accessible, to, the, general, public, with, air, travel, and, the, penetration, of, highways, into, mountainous, regions, it, is, still, common, in, ranges, such, as, the, alaska, range, and, the, himalayas, alpine, style, or, informal, variations, of, it, is, the, most, common, form, of, mountaineering, today, it, involves, a, single, straightforward, climb, of, the, mountain, with, no, backtracking, this, style, is, most, suited, for, medium, sized, mountain, areas, close, to, civilization, with, elevations, of, 2, 000, 5, 000, m, 6, 600, 16, 400, ft, such, as, the, alps, or, the, rocky, mountains, alpine, style, ascents, have, been, done, throughout, history, on, extreme, altitude, above, 5, 000, m, peaks, also, albeit, in, lower, volume, to, expedition, style, ascents, climbers, generally, carry, their, loads, between, camps, without, backtracking, in, a, single, push, for, the, summit, if, the, summit, is, reachable, from, the, base, camp, or, trailhead, within, one, day, then, alpine, style, mountaineers, will, not, change, camps, at, all, and, only, carry, the, slightest, of, loads, necessary, nourishment, and, equipment, up, to, the, summit, light, and, fast, is, the, mantra, of, the, alpine, mountaineer
