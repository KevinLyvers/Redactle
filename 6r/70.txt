powder, biscuits, mashed, potatoes, and, crumbs, pies, can, be, a, variety, of, sizes, ranging, from, bite, size, to, those, designed, for, multiple, servings, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, pie, appears, in, 1303, in, the, expense, accounts, of, the, bolton, priory, in, yorkshire, however, the, oxford, english, dictionary, is, uncertain, to, its, origin, and, says, no, further, related, word, is, known, outside, english, a, possible, origin, is, that, the, word, pie, is, connected, with, a, word, used, in, farming, to, indicate, a, collection, of, things, made, into, a, heap, for, example, a, heap, of, potatoes, covered, with, earth, one, source, of, the, word, pie, may, be, the, magpie, a, bird, known, for, collecting, odds, and, ends, in, its, nest, the, connection, could, be, that, medieval, pies, also, contained, many, different, animal, meats, including, chickens, crows, pigeons, and, rabbits, one, 1450, recipe, for, grete, pyes, that, might, support, the, magpie, etymology, contained, what, charles, perry, called, odds, and, ends, including, beef, beef, suet, capons, hens, both, mallard, and, teal, ducks, rabbits, woodcocks, and, large, birds, such, as, herons, and, storks, plus, beef, marrow, hard, cooked, egg, yolks, dates, raisins, and, prunes, early, pies, were, in, the, form, of, flat, round, or, freeform, crusty, cakes, called, galettes, consisting, of, a, crust, of, ground, oats, wheat, rye, or, barley, containing, honey, inside, these, galettes, developed, into, a, form, of, early, sweet, pastry, or, desserts, evidence, of, which, can, be, found, on, the, tomb, walls, of, the, pharaoh, ramesses, ii, who, ruled, from, 1304, to, 1237, bc, located, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, sometime, before, 2000, bc, a, recipe, for, chicken, pie, was, written, on, a, tablet, in, sumer, pie, pastry, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, ancient, greece, in, the, plays, of, aristophanes, 5th, century, bc, there, are, mentions, of, sweetmeats, including, small, pastries, filled, with, fruit, nothing, is, known, of, the, actual, pastry, used, but, the, greeks, certainly, recognized, the, trade, of, pastry, cook, as, distinct, from, that, of, baker, when, fat, is, added, to, a, flour, water, paste, it, becomes, a, pastry, the, romans, made, a, plain, pastry, of, flour, oil, and, water, to, cover, meats, and, fowls, which, were, baked, thus, keeping, in, the, juices, the, roman, approach, of, covering, birds, or, hams, with, dough, has, been, called, more, of, an, attempt, to, prevent, the, meat, from, drying, out, during, baking, than, an, actual, pie, in, the, modern, sense, the, covering, was, not, meant, to, be, eaten, it, filled, the, role, of, what, was, later, called, puff, paste, a, richer, pastry, intended, to, be, eaten, was, used, to, make, small, pasties, containing, eggs, or, little, birds, which, were, among, the, minor, items, served, at, banquets, the, first, written, reference, to, a, roman, pie, is, for, a, rye, dough, that, was, filled, with, a, mixture, of, goat, s, cheese, and, honey, the, 1st, century, roman, cookbook, apicius, makes, various, mentions, of, recipes, which, involve, a, pie, case, by, 160, bc, roman, statesman, marcus, porcius, cato, 234, 149, bc, who, wrote, de, agri, cultura, notes, the, recipe, for, the, most, popular, pie, cake, called, placenta, also, called, libum, by, the, romans, it, was, more, like, a, modern, day, cheesecake, on, a, pastry, base, often, used, as, an, offering, to, the, gods, with, the, development, of, the, roman, empire, and, its, efficient, road, transport, pie, cooking, spread, throughout, europe, wealthy, romans, combined, many, types, of, meats, in, their, pies, including, mussels, and, other, seafood, roman, pie, makers, generally, used, vegetable, oils, such, as, olive, oil, to, make, their, dough, pies, remained, as, a, staple, of, traveling, and, working, peoples, in, the, colder, northern, european, countries, with, regional, variations, based, on, both, the, locally, grown, and, available, meats, as, well, as, the, locally, farmed, cereal, crop, in, these, colder, countries, butter, and, lard, were, the, main, fats, in, use, which, meant, that, pie, cooks, created, dough, that, could, be, rolled, flat, and, moulded, into, different, shapes, the, cornish, pasty, is, an, adaptation, of, the, pie, to, a, working, man, s, daily, food, needs, the, first, reference, to, pyes, as, food, items, appeared, in, england, in, a, latin, context, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, but, it, is, not, clear, that, this, referred, to, baked, pies, in, the, medieval, era, pies, were, usually, savory, meat, pies, made, with, beef, lamb, wild, duck, magpie, pigeon, spiced, with, pepper, currants, or, dates, medieval, cooks, had, restricted, access, to, ovens, due, to, their, costs, of, construction, and, need, for, abundant, supplies, of, fuel, since, pies, could, be, easily, cooked, over, an, open, fire, this, made, pies, easier, for, most, cooks, to, make, at, the, same, time, by, partnering, with, a, baker, a, cook, could, focus, on, preparing, the, filling, the, earliest, pie, like, recipes, refer, to, coffyns, the, word, actually, used, for, a, basket, or, box, with, straight, sealed, sides, and, a, top, open, top, pies, were, called, traps, the, resulting, hardened, pastry, was, not, necessarily, eaten, its, function, being, to, contain, the, filling, for, cooking, and, to, store, it, though, whether, servants, may, have, eaten, it, once, their, masters, had, eaten, the, filling, is, impossible, to, prove, the, thick, crust, was, so, sturdy, it, had, to, be, cracked, open, to, get, to, the, filling, this, may, also, be, the, reason, why, early, recipes, focus, on, the, filling, over, the, surrounding, case, with, this, development, leading, to, the, use, of, reusable, earthenware, pie, cases, which, reduced, the, use, of, expensive, flour, medieval, pie, crusts, were, often, baked, first, to, create, a, pot, of, baked, dough, with, a, removable, top, crust, hence, the, name, pot, pie, the, first, unequivocal, reference, to, pie, in, a, written, source, is, in, the, 14th, century, oxford, english, dictionary, sb, pie, the, eating, of, mince, pies, during, festive, periods, is, a, tradition, that, dates, back, to, the, 13th,

cookbook, a, forme, of, cury, had, a, recipe, for, tartes, of, flesh, which, included, a, ground, up, mixture, of, pork, hard, boiled, eggs, and, cheese, blended, with, spices, saffron, and, sugar, the, 14th, century, french, chef, taillevent, instructed, bakers, to, crenelate, pie, shells, and, reinforce, them, so, that, they, can, support, the, meat, one, of, his, pies, was, high, enough, that, it, resembled, a, model, of, a, castle, an, illusion, enhanced, by, miniature, banners, for, the, nobles, at, the, event, pies, in, the, 1400s, included, birds, as, song, birds, at, the, time, were, a, delicacy, and, protected, by, royal, law, at, the, coronation, of, eight, year, old, english, king, henry, vi, 1422, 1461, in, 1429, partrich, and, pecok, enhakill, were, served, alleged, by, some, modern, writers, to, consist, of, cooked, peacock, mounted, in, its, skin, on, a, peacock, filled, pie, the, expressions, eat, crow, and, four, and, 20, blackbirds, are, sayings, from, the, era, when, crow, and, blackbirds, were, eaten, in, pies, cooked, birds, were, frequently, placed, by, european, royal, cooks, on, top, of, a, large, pie, to, identify, its, contents, leading, to, its, later, adaptation, in, pre, victorian, times, as, a, porcelain, ornament, to, release, of, steam, the, apple, pie, was, first, referenced, in, writing, in, 1589, when, the, poet, r, green, wrote, thy, breath, is, like, the, seeme, of, apple, pies, medieval, england, had, an, early, form, of, sweet, pies, called, tarts, and, fruit, pies, were, unsweetened, because, sugar, was, a, rare, and, costly, status, symbol, in, the, middle, ages, a, pie, could, have, a, number, of, items, as, its, filling, but, a, pastry, would, have, only, a, single, filling, until, the, start, of, the, 15th, century, pies, were, expected, to, contain, meat, or, fish, in, the, 15th, century, custard, and, fruit, pie, recipes, began, appearing, often, with, dried, fruit, like, dates, and, raisins, fresh, fruit, did, not, become, widely, used, until, sugar, dropped, in, price, during, the, 16th, century, the, first, fruit, pie, is, recorded, in, the, late, 16th, century, when, queen, elizabeth, i, was, served, cherry, pie, queen, elizabeth, i, was, often, given, gifts, of, quince, or, pear, pies, for, new, years, during, the, shakespearean, era, fruit, pies, were, served, hot, but, others, were, served, at, room, temperature, as, they, would, be, brought, to, the, table, more, than, once, apple, pies, were, popular, in, tudor, and, stuart, times, pippins, were, baked, with, cloves, cinnamon, dates, and,

elkes, porpus, and, such, like, standing, dishes, which, must, be, kept, long, in, a, moyst, thick, tough, course, and, long, lasting, crust, and, therefore, of, all, other, your, rye, paste, is, best, for, that, purpose, the, largest, pies, of, the, era, were, standing, pies, which, were, baked, with, steam, holes, which, were, then, sealed, with, melted, butter, which, would, harden, to, seal, the, pie, and, then, eaten, over, several, months, during, the, puritan, era, of, oliver, cromwell, some, sources, claim, mince, pie, eating, was, banned, as, a, frivolous, activity, for, 16, years, so, mince, pie, making, and, eating, became, an, underground, activity, the, ban, was, lifted, in, 1660, with, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, food, historian, annie, gray, suggests, that, the, myth, of, the, puritans, actively, banning, mince, pies, came, about, due, to, the, defenders, of, christmas, who, reported, puritan, vitriol, with, a, certain, amount, of, exaggeration, in, the, 17th, century, ben, jonson, described, a, skilled, pie, cook, by, comparing, the, cook, to, a, fortification, builder, who, makes, citadels, of, curious, fowl, and, fish, and, makes, dry, ditches, bulwark, pies, and, ramparts, of, immortal, crusts, in, gervase, markham, s, 1615, book, the, english, huswife, there, is, a, pie, recipe, that, calls, for, an, entire, leg, of, mutton, and, three, pounds, of, suet, along, with, salt, cloves, mace, currants, raisins, prunes, dates, and, orange, peel, which, made, a, huge, pie, that, could, serve, a, large, group, in, the, georgian, era, sweetened, pies, of, meat, and, dried, fruits, began, to, become, less, popular, in, recipe, books, of, the, period, sweet, veal, sweet, lamb, or, sweet, chicken, pies, are, given, alongside, recipes, for, unsweetened, alternatives, with, the, same, ingredients, made, for, those, who, could, no, longer, stomach, the, sweetened, flesh, meats, enjoyed, by, earlier, generations, pumpkin, pie, was, fashionable, in, england, from, the, 1650s, onward, then, fell, out, of, favour, during, the, 18th, century, pumpkin, was, sliced, fried, with, sweet, herbs, sweetened, with, sugar, and, eggs, were, added, this, was, put, into, a, pastry, case, with, currants, and, apples, pumpkin, pie, was, introduced, to, america, by, early, colonists, where, it, became, a, national, dish, during, the, 19th, century, pies, became, according, to, food, historian, janet, clarkson, universally, esteemed, in, a, way, that, other, foods, were, not, in, 1806, mrs, rundell, in, her, observations, on, savoury, pies, in, a, new, system, of, domestic, cookery, stated, that, there, are, few, articles, of, cookery, more, generally, liked, than, relishing, pies, if, properly, made, alexis, soyer, a, celebrity, cook, of, the, 19th, century, said, in, his, book, shilling, cookery, for, the, people, 1860, from, childhood, we, eat, pies, from, girlhood, to, boyhood, we, eat, pies, in, fact, pies, in, england, may, be, considered, as, one, of, our, best, companions, du, voyage, through, life, it, is, we, who, leave, them, behind, not, they, who, leave, us, for, our, children, and, grandchildren, will, be, as, fond, of, pies, as, we, have, been, therefore, it, is, needful, that, we, should, learn, how, to, make, them, and, make, them, well, believe, me, i, am, not, jesting, but, if, all, the, spoilt, pies, made, in, london, on, one, single, sunday, were, to, be, exhibited, in, a, row, beside, a, railway, line, it, would, take, above, an, hour, by, special, train, to, pass, in, review, these, culinary, victims, the, pilgrim, fathers, and, early, settlers, brought, their, pie, recipes, with, them, to, america, adapting, to, the, ingredients, and, techniques, available, to, them, in, the, new, world, settlers, recipes, were, for, english, style, meat, pies, the, newcomers, used, the, fruits, and, berries, that, they, were, familiar, with, from, europe, but, also, began, incorporating, north, american, vegetables, and, game, that, they, were, not, familiar, with, with, guidance, from, indigenous, people, settlers, favoured, pies, over, bread, because, pies, required, less, flour, and, did, not, require, a, brick, bread, oven, and, because, any, mixture, of, ingredients, could, be, added, to, pies, to, stretch, their, meager, provisions, the, apple, pie, made, with, american, apples, became, popular, because, apples, were, easy, to, dry, and, store, in, barrels, over, the, winter, early, american, pies, had, thick, heavy, crusts, made, with, rough, flour, and, suet, as, pioneers, spread, westward, pies, continued, to, be, an, important, supply, of, food, while, apple, pies, made, from, dried, apples, were, popular, cooks, often, had, to, use, fillers, or, substitutes, to, stretch, out, their, barrels, of, apples, such, as, crushed, crackers, vinegar, soaked, potatoes, sour, green, tomatoes, and, soft, shelled, river, turtle, meat, the, first, thanksgiving, feast, included, fowl, and, venison, which, may, have, been, included, in, pies, colonists, appreciated, the, food, preservation, aspect, of, crusty, topped, pies, which, were, often, seasoned, with, dried, fruit, cinnamon, pepper, and, nutmeg, their, first, pies, included, pies, that, were, based, on, berries, and, fruits, pointed, out, to, them, by, the, native, north, americans, pies, allowed, colonial, cooks, to, use, round, shallow, pans, to, literally, cut, corners, and, to, create, a, regional, variation, of, shallow, pie, by, the, late, 1700s, cookbooks, show, a, wide, range, of, newly, developed, sweet, pies, pies, became, more, refined, with, subsequent, waves, of, immigrants, the, pennsylvania, dutch, contributed, a, more, aromatic, spiced, and, less, sweet, style, of, pie, making, the, french, brought, the, approach, of, making, pie, with, butter, and, a, range, of, tart, galette, and, p, t, forcemeat, of, meat, and, fish, in, dough, recipes, swedish,

pie, was, popular, as, pumpkins, were, plentiful, once, the, british, had, established, caribbean, colonies, sugar, became, less, expensive, and, more, widely, available, which, meant, that, sweet, pies, could, be, readily, made, molasses, was, popular, in, american, pies, due, to, the, rum, and, slave, trade, with, the, caribbean, islands, although, maple, syrup, was, an, important, sweetener, in, northern, states, after, indigenous, people, taught, settlers, how, to, tap, maple, trees, and, boil, down, the, sap, in, the, midwest, cheese, and, cream, pies, were, popular, due, to, the, availability, of, big, dairy, farms, in, the, us, south, african, americans, enjoyed, sweet, potato, pies, due, to, the, widespread, availability, of, this, type, of, potato, by, the, 1870s, the, new, science, of, nutrition, led, to, criticism, of, pies, notably, by, sarah, tyson, rorer, a, cooking, teacher, and, food, editor, who, warned, the, public, about, how, much, energy, pies, take, to, digest, rorer, stated, that, all, pie, crusts, are, to, be, condemned, and, her, cookbook, only, included, an, apple, tart, jelly, and, meringue, covered, crackers, p, t, and, a, hygienic, pie, which, had, apple, slices, or, a, pumpkin, custard, baked, in, biscuit, dough, in, 1866, harper, s, magazine, included, an, article, by, c, w, gesner, that, stated, that, although, we, cry, for, pie, when, we, are, infants, pie, kills, us, finally, as, the, heavy, crust, cannot, be, digested, another, factor, that, decreased, the, popularity, of, pies, was, industrialization, and, increasing, movement, of, women, into, the, labour, market, which, changed, pie, making, from, a, weekly, ritual, to, an, occasional, undertaking, on, special, occasions, in, the, 1950s, after, wwii, the, popularity, of, pies, rebounded, in, the, us, especially, with, commercial, food, inventions, such, as, instant, pudding, mixes, cool, whip, topping, and, jello, gelatin, which, could, be, used, as, fillings, ready,
