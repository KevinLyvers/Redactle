birth, control, also, known, as, contraception, anticonception, and, fertility, control, is, the, use, of, methods, or, devices, to, prevent, unintended, pregnancy, birth, control, has, been, used, since, ancient, times, but, effective, and, safe, methods, of, birth, control, only, became, available, in, the, 20th, century, planning, making, available, and, using, human, birth, control, is, called, family, planning, some, cultures, limit, or, discourage, access, to, birth, control, because, they, consider, it, to, be, morally, religiously, or, politically, undesirable, the, world, health, organization, and, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, provide, guidance, on, the, safety, of, birth, control, methods, among, women, with, specific, medical, conditions, the, most, effective, methods, of, birth, control, are, sterilization, by, means, of, vasectomy, in, males, and, tubal, ligation, in, females, intrauterine, devices, iuds, and, implantable, birth, control, this, is, followed, by, a, number, of, hormone, based, methods, including, oral, pills, patches, vaginal, rings, and, injections, less, effective, methods, include, physical, barriers, such, as, condoms, diaphragms, and, birth, control, sponges, and, fertility, awareness, methods, the, least, effective, methods, are, spermicides, and, withdrawal, by, the, male, before, ejaculation, sterilization, while, highly, effective, is, not, usually, reversible, all, other, methods, are, reversible, most, immediately, upon, stopping, them, safe, sex, practices, such, as, with, the, use, of, male, or, female, condoms, can, also, help, prevent, sexually, transmitted, infections, other, methods, of, birth, control, do, not, protect, against, sexually, transmitted, infections, emergency, birth, control, can, prevent, pregnancy, if, taken, within, 72, to, 120, hours, after, unprotected, sex, some, argue, not, having, sex, is, also, a, form, of, birth, control, but, abstinence, only, sex, education, may, increase, teenage, pregnancies, if, offered, without, birth, control, education, due, to, non, compliance, in, teenagers, pregnancies, are, at, greater, risk, of, poor, outcomes, comprehensive, sex, education, and, access, to, birth, control, decreases, the, rate, of, unintended, pregnancies, in, this, age, group, while, all, forms, of, birth, control, can, generally, be, used, by, young, people, long, acting, reversible, birth, control, such, as, implants, iuds, or, vaginal, rings, are, more, successful, in, reducing, rates, of, teenage, pregnancy, after, the, delivery, of, a, child, a, woman, who, is, not, exclusively, breastfeeding, may, become, pregnant, again, after, as, few, as, four, to, six, weeks, some, methods, of, birth, control, can, be, started, immediately, following, the, birth, while, others, require, a, delay, of, up, to, six, months, in, women, who, are, breastfeeding, progestin, only, methods, are, preferred, over, combined, oral, birth, control, pills, in, women, who, have, reached, menopause, it, is, recommended, that, birth, control, be, continued, for, one, year, after, the, last, menstrual, period, about, 222, million, women, who, want, to, avoid, pregnancy, in, developing, countries, are, not, using, a, modern, birth, control, method, birth, control, use, in, developing, countries, has, decreased, the, number, of, deaths, during, or, around, the, time, of, pregnancy, by, 40, about, 270, 000, deaths, prevented, in, 2008, and, could, prevent, 70, if, the, full, demand, for, birth, control, were, met, by, lengthening, the, time, between, pregnancies, birth, control, can, improve, adult, women, s, delivery, outcomes, and, the, survival, of, their, children, in, the, developing, world, women, s, earnings, assets, and, weight, as, well, as, their, children, s, schooling, and, health, all, improve, with, greater, access, to, birth, control, birth, control, increases, economic, growth, because, of, fewer, dependent, children, more, women, participating, in, the, workforce, and, or, less, use, of, scarce, resources, birth, control, methods, include, barrier, methods, hormonal, birth, control, intrauterine, devices, iuds, sterilization, and, behavioral, methods, they, are, used, before, or, during, sex, while, emergency, contraceptives, are, effective, for, up, to, five, days, after, sex, effectiveness, is, generally, expressed, as, the, percentage, of, women, who, become, pregnant, using, a, given, method, during, the, first, year, and, sometimes, as, a, lifetime, failure, rate, among, methods, with, high, effectiveness, such, as, tubal, ligation, birth, control, methods, fall, into, two, main, categories, male, contraception, and, female, contraception, common, male, contraceptives, are, withdrawal, condoms, and, vasectomy, female, contraception, is, more, developed, compared, to, male, contraception, these, include, contraceptive, pills, combination, and, progestin, only, pill, hormonal, or, non, hormonal, iud, patch, vaginal, ring, diaphragm, shot, implant, fertility, awareness, and, tubal, ligation, the, most, effective, methods, are, those, that, are, long, acting, and, do, not, require, ongoing, health, care, visits, surgical, sterilization, implantable, hormones, and, intrauterine, devices, all, have, first, year, failure, rates, of, less, than, 1, hormonal, contraceptive, pills, patches, or, vaginal, rings, and, the, lactational, amenorrhea, method, lam, if, adhered, to, strictly, can, also, have, first, year, or, for, lam, first, 6, month, failure, rates, of, less, than, 1, with, typical, use, first, year, failure, rates, are, considerably, higher, at, 9, due, to, inconsistent, use, other, methods, such, as, condoms, diaphragms, and, spermicides, have, higher, first, year, failure, rates, even, with, perfect, usage, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, long, acting, reversible, birth, control, as, first, line, for, young, individuals, while, all, methods, of, birth, control, have, some, potential, adverse, effects, the, risk, is, less, than, that, of, pregnancy, after, stopping, or, removing, many, methods, of, birth, control, including, oral, contraceptives, iuds, implants, and, injections, the, rate, of, pregnancy, during, the, subsequent, year, is, the, same, as, for, those, who, used, no, birth, control, for, individuals, with, specific, health, problems, certain, forms, of, birth, control, may, require, further, investigations, for, women, who, are, otherwise, healthy, many, methods, of, birth, control, should, not, require, a, medical, exam, including, birth, control, pills, injectable, or, implantable, birth, control, and, condoms, for, example, a, pelvic, exam, breast, exam, or, blood, test, before, starting, birth, control, pills, does, not, appear, to, affect, outcomes, in, 2009, the, world, health, organization, who, published, a, detailed, list, of, medical, eligibility, criteria, for, each, type, of, birth, control, hormonal, contraception, is, available, in, a, number, of, different, forms, including, oral, pills, implants, under, the, skin, injections, patches, iuds, and, a, vaginal, ring, they, are, currently, available, only, for, women, although, hormonal, contraceptives, for, men, have, been, and, are, being, clinically, tested, there, are, two, types, of, oral, birth, control, pills, the, combined, oral, contraceptive, pills, which, contain, both, estrogen, and, a, progestin, and, the, progestogen, only, pills, sometimes, called, minipills, if, either, is, taken, during, pregnancy, they, do, not, increase, the, risk, of, miscarriage, nor, cause, birth, defects, both, types, of, birth, control, pills, prevent, fertilization, mainly, by, inhibiting, ovulation, and, thickening, cervical, mucus, they, may, also, change, the, lining, of, the, uterus, and, thus, decrease, implantation, their, effectiveness, depends, on, the, user, s, adherence, to, taking, the, pills, combined, hormonal, contraceptives, are, associated, with, a, slightly, increased, risk, of, venous, and, arterial, blood, clots, venous, clots, on, average, increase, from, 2, 8, to, 9, 8, per, 10, 000, women, years, which, is, still, less, than, that, associated, with, pregnancy, due, to, this, risk, they, are, not, recommended, in, women, over, 35, years, of, age, who, continue, to, smoke, due, to, the, increased, risk, they, are, included, in, decision, tools, such, as, the, dash, score, and, perc, rule, used, to, predict, the, risk, of, blood, clots, the, effect, on, sexual, drive, is, varied, with, increase, or, decrease, in, some, but, with, no, effect, in, most, combined, oral, contraceptives, reduce, the, risk, of, ovarian, cancer, and, endometrial, cancer, and, do, not, change, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, they, often, reduce, menstrual, bleeding, and, painful, menstruation, cramps, the, lower, doses, of, estrogen, released, from, the, vaginal, ring, may, reduce, the, risk, of, breast, tenderness, nausea, and, headache, associated, with, higher, dose, estrogen, products, progestin, only, pills, injections, and, intrauterine, devices, are, not, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, blood, clots, and, may, be, used, by, women, with, a, history, of, blood, clots, in, their, veins, in, those, with, a, history, of, arterial, blood, clots, non, hormonal, birth, control, or, a, progestin, only, method, other, than, the, injectable, version, should, be, used, progestin, only, pills, may, improve, menstrual, symptoms, and, can, be, used, by, breastfeeding, women, as, they, do, not, affect, milk, production, irregular, bleeding, may, occur, with, progestin, only, methods, with, some, users, reporting, no, periods, the, progestins, drospirenone, and, desogestrel, minimize, the, androgenic, side, effects, but, increase, the, risks, of, blood, clots, and, are, thus, not, first, line, the, perfect, use, first, year, failure, rate, of, injectable, progestin, is, 0, 2, the, typical, use, first, failure, rate, is, 6, barrier, contraceptives, are, devices, that, attempt, to, prevent, pregnancy, by, physically, preventing, sperm, from, entering, the, uterus, they, include, male, condoms, female, condoms, cervical, caps, diaphragms, and, contraceptive, sponges, with, spermicide, globally, condoms, are, the, most, common, method, of, birth, control, male, condoms, are, put, on, a, man, s, erect, penis, and, physically, block, ejaculated, sperm, from, entering, the, body, of, a, sexual, partner, modern, condoms, are, most, often, made, from, latex, but, some, are, made, from, other, materials, such, as, polyurethane, or, lamb, s, intestine, female, condoms, are, also, available, most, often, made, of, nitrile, latex, or, polyurethane, male, condoms, have, the, advantage, of, being, inexpensive, easy, to, use, and, have, few, adverse, effects, making, condoms, available, to, teenagers, does, not, appear, to, affect, the, age, of, onset, of, sexual, activity, or, its, frequency, in, japan, about, 80, of, couples, who, are, using, birth, control, use, condoms, while, in, germany, this, number, is, about, 25, and, in, the, united, states, it, is, 18, male, condoms, and, the, diaphragm, with, spermicide, have, typical, use, first, year, failure, rates, of, 18, and, 12, respectively, with, perfect, use, condoms, are, more, effective, with, a, 2, first, year, failure, rate, versus, a, 6, first, year, rate, with, the, diaphragm, condoms, have, the, additional, benefit, of, helping, to, prevent, the, spread, of, some, sexually, transmitted, infections, such, as, hiv, aids, however, condoms, made, from, animal, intestine, do, not, contraceptive, sponges, combine, a, barrier, with, a, spermicide, like, diaphragms, they, are, inserted, vaginally, before, intercourse, and, must, be, placed, over, the, cervix, to, be, effective, typical, failure, rates, during, the, first, year, depend, on, whether, or, not, a, woman, has, previously, given, birth, being, 24, in, those, who, have, and, 12, in, those, who, have, not, the, sponge, can, be, inserted, up, to, 24, hours, before, intercourse, and, must, be, left, in, place, for, at, least, six, hours, afterward, allergic, reactions, and, more, severe, adverse, effects, such, as, toxic, shock, syndrome, have, been, reported, the, current, intrauterine, devices, iud, are, small, devices, often, t, shaped, containing, either, copper, or, levonorgestrel, which, are, inserted, into, the, uterus, they, are, one, form, of, long, acting, reversible, contraception, which, are, the, most, effective, types, of, reversible, birth, control, failure, rates, with, the, copper, iud, is, about, 0, 8, while, the, levonorgestrel, iud, has, a, failure, rates, of, 0, 2, in, the, first, year, of, use, among, types, of, birth, control, they, along, with, birth, control, implants, result, in, the, greatest, satisfaction, among, users, as, of, 2007, iuds, are, the, most, widely, used, form, of, reversible, contraception, with, more, than, 180, million, users, worldwide, evidence, supports, effectiveness, and, safety, in, adolescents, and, those, who, have, and, have, not, previously, had, children, iuds, do, not, affect, breastfeeding, and, can, be, inserted, immediately, after, delivery, they, may, also, be, used, immediately, after, an, abortion, once, removed, even, after, long, term, use, fertility, returns, to, normal, immediately, while, copper, iuds, may, increase, menstrual, bleeding, and, result, in, more, painful, cramps, hormonal, iuds, may, reduce, menstrual, bleeding, or, stop, menstruation, altogether, cramping, can, be, treated, with, painkillers, like, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, other, potential, complications, include, expulsion, 2, 5, and, rarely, perforation, of, the, uterus, less, than, 0, 7, a, previous, model, of, the, intrauterine, device, the, dalkon, shield, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, however, the, risk, is, not, affected, with, current, models, in, those, without, sexually, transmitted, infections, around, the, time, of, insertion, iuds, appear, to, decrease, the, risk, of, ovarian, cancer, two, broad, categories, exist, surgical, and, non, surgical, surgical, sterilization, is, available, in, the, form, of, tubal, ligation, for, women, and, vasectomy, for, men, tubal, ligation, decreases, the, risk, of, ovarian, cancer, short, term, complications, are, twenty, times, less, likely, from, a, vasectomy, than, a, tubal, ligation, after, a, vasectomy, there, may, be, swelling, and, pain, of, the, scrotum, which, usually, resolves, in, one, or, two, weeks, chronic, scrotal, pain, associated, with, negative, impact, on, quality, of, life, occurs, after, vasectomy, in, about, 1, 2, of, men, with, tubal, ligation, complications, occur, in, 1, to, 2, percent, of, procedures, with, serious, complications, usually, due, to, the, anesthesia, neither, method, offers, protection, from, sexually, transmitted, infections, sometimes, salpingectomy, is, also, used, for, sterilization, in, women, non, surgical, sterilization, methods, have, also, been, explored, fahim, et, al, found, that, heat, exposure, especially, high, intensity, ultrasound, was, effective, either, for, temporary, or, permanent, contraception, depending, on, the, dose, e, g, selective, destruction, of, germ, cells, and, sertoli, cells, without, affecting, leydig, cells, or, testosterone, levels, chemical, e, g, drug, based, methods, are, also, available, e, g, orally, administered, lonidamine, for, temporary, or, permanent, depending, on, the, dose, fertility, management, boris, provides, a, method, for, chemically, inducing, either, temporary, or, non, reversible, sterility, depending, on, the, dose, permanent, sterility, in, human, males, can, be, obtained, by, a, single, oral, dosage, containing, from, about, 18, mg, kg, to, about, 25, mg, kg, the, permanence, of, this, decision, may, cause, regret, in, some, men, and, women, of, women, who, have, undergone, tubal, ligation, after, the, age, of, 30, about, 6, regret, their, decision, as, compared, with, 20, 24, of, women, who, received, sterilization, within, one, year, of, delivery, and, before, turning, 30, and, 6, in, nulliparous, women, sterilized, before, the, age, of, 30, by, contrast, less, than, 5, of, men, are, likely, to, regret, sterilization, men, who, are, more, likely, to, regret, sterilization, are, younger, have, young, or, no, children, or, have, an, unstable, marriage, in, a, survey, of, biological, parents, 9, stated, they, would, not, have, had, children, if, they, were, able, to, do, it, over, again, although, sterilization, is, considered, a, permanent, procedure, it, is, possible, to, attempt, a, tubal, reversal, to, reconnect, the, fallopian, tubes, or, a, vasectomy, reversal, to, reconnect, the, vasa, deferentia, in, women, the, desire, for, a, reversal, is, often, associated, with, a, change, in, spouse, pregnancy, success, rates, after, tubal, reversal, are, between, 31, and, 88, percent, with, complications, including, an, increased, risk, of, ectopic, pregnancy, the, number, of, males, who, request, reversal, is, between, 2, and, 6, percent, rates, of, success, in, fathering, another, child, after, reversal, are, between, 38, and, 84, percent, with, success, being, lower, the, longer, the, time, period, between, the, vasectomy, and, the, reversal, sperm, extraction, followed, by, in, vitro, fertilization, may, also, be, an, option, in, men, behavioral, methods, involve, regulating, the, timing, or, method, of, intercourse, to, prevent, introduction, of, sperm, into, the, female, reproductive, tract, either, altogether, or, when, an, egg, may, be, present, if, used, perfectly, the, first, year, failure, rate, may, be, around, 3, 4, however, if, used, poorly, first, year, failure, rates, may, approach, 85, fertility, awareness, methods, involve, determining, the, most, fertile, days, of, the, menstrual, cycle, and, avoiding, unprotected, intercourse, techniques, for, determining, fertility, include, monitoring, basal, body, temperature, cervical, secretions, or, the, day, of, the, cycle, they, have, typical, first, year, failure, rates, of, 24, perfect, use, first, year, failure, rates, depend, on, which, method, is, used, and, range, from, 0, 4, to, 5, the, evidence, on, which, these, estimates, are, based, however, is, poor, as, the, majority, of, people, in, trials, stop, their, use, early, globally, they, are, used, by, about, 3, 6, of, couples, if, based, on, both, basal, body, temperature, and, another, primary, sign, the, method, is, referred, to, as, symptothermal, first, year, failure, rates, of, 20, overall, and, 0, 4, for, perfect, use, have, been, reported, in, clinical, studies, of, the, symptothermal, method, a, number, of, fertility, tracking, apps, are, available, as, of, 2016, but, they, are, more, commonly, designed, to, assist, those, trying, to, get, pregnant, rather, than, prevent, pregnancy, the, withdrawal, method, also, known, as, coitus, interruptus, is, the, practice, of, ending, intercourse, pulling, out, before, ejaculation, the, main, risk, of, the, withdrawal, method, is, that, the, man, may, not, perform, the, maneuver, correctly, or, in, a, timely, manner, first, year, failure, rates, vary, from, 4, with, perfect, usage, to, 22, with, typical, usage, it, is, not, considered, birth, control, by, some, medical, professionals, there, is, little, data, regarding, the, sperm, content, of, pre, ejaculatory, fluid, while, some, tentative, research, did, not, find, sperm, one, trial, found, sperm, present, in, 10, out, of, 27, volunteers, the, withdrawal, method, is, used, as, birth, control, by, about, 3, of, couples, sexual, abstinence, may, be, used, as, a, form, of, birth, control, meaning, either, not, engaging, in, any, type, of, sexual, activity, or, specifically, not, engaging, in, vaginal, intercourse, while, engaging, in, other, forms, of, non, vaginal, sex, complete, sexual, abstinence, is, 100, effective, in, preventing, pregnancy, however, among, those, who, take, a, pledge, to, abstain, from, premarital, sex, as, many, as, 88, who, engage, in, sex, do, so, prior, to, marriage, the, choice, to, abstain, from, sex, cannot, protect, against, pregnancy, as, a, result, of, rape, and, public, health, efforts, emphasizing, abstinence, to, reduce, unwanted, pregnancy, may, have, limited, effectiveness, especially, in, developing, countries, and, among, disadvantaged, groups, deliberate, non, penetrative, sex, without, vaginal, sex, or, deliberate, oral, sex, without, vaginal, sex, are, also, sometimes, considered, birth, control, while, this, generally, avoids, pregnancy, pregnancy, can, still, occur, with, intercrural, sex, and, other, forms, of, penis, near, vagina, sex, genital, rubbing, and, the, penis, exiting, from, anal, intercourse, where, sperm, can, be, deposited, near, the, entrance, to, the, vagina, and, can, travel, along, the, vagina, s, lubricating, fluids, abstinence, only, sex, education, does, not, reduce, teenage, pregnancy, teen, pregnancy, rates, and, sti, rates, are, generally, the, same, or, higher, in, states, where, students, are, given, abstinence, only, education, as, compared, with, comprehensive, sex, education, some, authorities, recommend, that, those, using, abstinence, as, a, primary, method, have, backup, methods, available, such, as, condoms, or, emergency, contraceptive, pills, the, lactational, amenorrhea, method, involves, the, use, of, a, woman, s, natural, postpartum, infertility, which, occurs, after, delivery, and, may, be, extended, by, breastfeeding, for, a, postpartum, woman, to, be, infertile, protected, from, pregnancy, their, periods, have, usually, not, yet, returned, not, menstruating, they, are, exclusively, breastfeeding, the, infant, and, the, baby, is, younger, than, six, months, if, breastfeeding, is, the, infant, s, only, source, of, nutrition, and, the, baby, is, less, than, 6, months, old, 93, 99, of, women, are, estimated, to, have, protection, from, becoming, pregnant, in, the, first, six, months, 0, 75, 7, 5, failure, rate, the, failure, rate, increases, to, 4, 7, at, one, year, and, 13, at, two, years, feeding, formula, pumping, instead, of, nursing, the, use, of, a, pacifier, and, feeding, solids, all, increase, the, chances, of, becoming, pregnant, while, breastfeeding, in, those, who, are, exclusively, breastfeeding, about, 10, begin, having, periods, before, three, months, and, 20, before, six, months, in, those, who, are, not, breastfeeding, fertility, may, return, as, early, as, four, weeks, after, delivery, emergency, contraceptive, methods, are, medications, sometimes, misleadingly, referred, to, as, morning, after, pills, or, devices, used, after, unprotected, sexual, intercourse, with, the, hope, of, preventing, pregnancy, emergency, contraceptives, are, often, given, to, victims, of, rape, they, work, primarily, by, preventing, ovulation, or, fertilization, they, are, unlikely, to, affect, implantation, but, this, has, not, been, completely, excluded, a, number, of, options, exist, including, high, dose, birth, control, pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal, and, iuds, all, methods, have, minimal, side, effects, providing, emergency, contraceptive, pills, to, women, in, advance, of, sexual, activity, does, not, affect, rates, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, condom, use, pregnancy, rates, or, sexual, risk, taking, behavior, in, a, uk, study, when, a, three, month, bridge, supply, of, the, progestogen, only, pill, was, provided, by, a, pharmacist, along, with, emergency, contraception, after, sexual, activity, this, intervention, was, shown, to, increase, the, likelihood, that, the, person, would, begin, to, use, an, effective, method, of, long, term, contraception, levonorgestrel, pills, when, used, within, 3, days, decrease, the, chance, of, pregnancy, after, a, single, episode, of, unprotected, sex, or, condom, failure, by, 70, resulting, in, a, pregnancy, rate, of, 2, 2, ulipristal, when, used, within, 5, days, decreases, the, chance, of, pregnancy, by, about, 85, pregnancy, rate, 1, 4, and, is, more, effective, than, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, is, also, more, effective, than, levonorgestrel, while, copper, iuds, are, the, most, effective, method, iuds, can, be, inserted, up, to, five, days, after, intercourse, and, prevent, about, 99, of, pregnancies, after, an, episode, of, unprotected, sex, pregnancy, rate, of, 0, 1, to, 0, 2, this, makes, them, the, most, effective, form, of, emergency, contraceptive, in, those, who, are, overweight, or, obese, levonorgestrel, is, less, effective, and, an, iud, or, ulipristal, is, recommended, dual, protection, is, the, use, of, methods, that, prevent, both, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, pregnancy, this, can, be, with, condoms, either, alone, or, along, with, another, birth, control, method, or, by, the, avoidance, of, penetrative, sex, if, pregnancy, is, a, high, concern, using, two, methods, at, the, same, time, is, reasonable, for, example, two, forms, of, birth, control, are, recommended, in, those, taking, the, anti, acne, drug, isotretinoin, or, anti, epileptic, drugs, like, carbamazepine, due, to, the, high, risk, of, birth, defects, if, taken, during, pregnancy, contraceptive, use, in, developing, countries, is, estimated, to, have, decreased, the, number, of, maternal, deaths, by, 40, about, 270, 000, deaths, prevented, in, 2008, and, could, prevent, 70, of, deaths, if, the, full, demand, for, birth, control, were, met, these, benefits, are, achieved, by, reducing, the, number, of, unplanned, pregnancies, that, subsequently, result, in, unsafe, abortions, and, by, preventing, pregnancies, in, those, at, high, risk, birth, control, also, improves, child, survival, in, the, developing, world, by, lengthening, the, time, between, pregnancies, in, this, population, outcomes, are, worse, when, a, mother, gets, pregnant, within, eighteen, months, of, a, previous, delivery, delaying, another, pregnancy, after, a, miscarriage, however, does, not, appear, to, alter, risk, and, women, are, advised, to, attempt, pregnancy, in, this, situation, whenever, they, are, ready, teenage, pregnancies, especially, among, younger, teens, are, at, greater, risk, of, adverse, outcomes, including, early, birth, low, birth, weight, and, death, of, the, infant, in, 2012, in, the, united, states, 82, of, pregnancies, in, those, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 19, years, old, are, unplanned, comprehensive, sex, education, and, access, to, birth, control, are, effective, in, decreasing, pregnancy, rates, in, this, age, group, birth, control, methods, especially, hormonal, methods, can, also, have, undesirable, side, effects, intensity, of, side, effects, can, range, from, minor, to, debilitating, and, varies, with, individual, experiences, these, most, commonly, include, change, in, menstruation, regularity, and, flow, nausea, breast, tenderness, headaches, weight, gain, and, mood, changes, specifically, an, increase, in, depression, and, anxiety, additionally, hormonal, contraception, can, contribute, to, bone, mineral, density, loss, impaired, glucose, metabolism, increased, risk, of, venous, thromboembolism, comprehensive, sex, education, and, transparent, discussion, of, birth, control, side, effects, and, contraindications, between, healthcare, provider, and, patient, is, imperative, in, the, developing, world, birth, control, increases, economic, growth, due, to, there, being, fewer, dependent, children, and, thus, more, women, participating, in, or, increased, contribution, to, the, workforce, as, they, are, usually, the, primary, caregiver, for, children, women, s, earnings, assets, body, mass, index, and, their, children, s, schooling, and, body, mass, index, all, improve, with, greater, access, to, birth, control, family, planning, via, the, use, of, modern, birth, control, is, one, of, the, most, cost, effective, health, interventions, for, every, dollar, spent, the, united, nations, estimates, that, two, to, six, dollars, are, saved, these, cost, savings, are, related, to, preventing, unplanned, pregnancies, and, decreasing, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, illnesses, while, all, methods, are, beneficial, financially, the, use, of, copper, iuds, resulted, in, the, greatest, savings, the, total, medical, cost, for, a, pregnancy, delivery, and, care, of, a, newborn, in, the, united, states, is, on, average, 21, 000, for, a, vaginal, delivery, and, 31, 000, for, a, caesarean, delivery, as, of, 2012, in, most, other, countries, the, cost, is, less, than, half, for, a, child, born, in, 2011, an, average, us, family, will, spend, 235, 000, over, 17, years, to, raise, them, globally, as, of, 2009, approximately, 60, of, those, who, are, married, and, able, to, have, children, use, birth, control, how, frequently, different, methods, are, used, varies, widely, between, countries, the, most, common, method, in, the, developed, world, is, condoms, and, oral, contraceptives, while, in, africa, it, is, oral, contraceptives, and, in, latin, america, and, asia, it, is, sterilization, in, the, developing, world, overall, 35, of, birth, control, is, via, female, sterilization, 30, is, via, iuds, 12, is, via, oral, contraceptives, 11, is, via, condoms, and, 4, is, via, male, sterilization, while, less, used, in, the, developed, countries, than, the, developing, world, the, number, of, women, using, iuds, as, of, 2007, was, more, than, 180, million, avoiding, sex, when, fertile, is, used, by, about, 3, 6, of, women, of, childbearing, age, with, usage, as, high, as, 20, in, areas, of, south, america, as, of, 2005, 12, of, couples, are, using, a, male, form, of, birth, control, either, condoms, or, a, vasectomy, with, higher, rates, in, the, developed, world, usage, of, male, forms, of, birth, control, has, decreased, between, 1985, and, 2009, contraceptive, use, among, women, in, sub, saharan, africa, has, risen, from, about, 5, in, 1991, to, about, 30, in, 2006, as, of, 2012, 57, of, women, of, childbearing, age, want, to, avoid, pregnancy, 867, of, 1, 520, million, about, 222, million, women, however, were, not, able, to, access, birth, control, 53, million, of, whom, were, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, 97, million, of, whom, were, in, asia, this, results, in, 54, million, unplanned, pregnancies, and, nearly, 80, 000, maternal, deaths, a, year, part, of, the, reason, that, many, women, are, without, birth, control, is, that, many, countries, limit, access, due, to, religious, or, political, reasons, while, another, contributor, is, poverty, due, to, restrictive, abortion, laws, in, sub, saharan, africa, many, women, turn, to, unlicensed, abortion, providers, for, unintended, pregnancy, resulting, in, about, 2, 4, obtaining, unsafe, abortions, each, year, the, egyptian, ebers, papyrus, from, 1550, bc, and, the, kahun, papyrus, from, 1850, bc, have, within, them, some, of, the, earliest, documented, descriptions, of, birth, control, the, use, of, honey, acacia, leaves, and, lint, to, be, placed, in, the, vagina, to, block, sperm, silphium, a, species, of, giant, fennel, native, to, north, africa, may, have, been, used, as, birth, control, in, ancient, greece, and, the, ancient, near, east, due, to, its, desirability, by, the, first, century, ad, it, had, become, so, rare, that, it, was, worth, more, than, its, weight, in, silver, and, by, late, antiquity, it, was, fully, extinct, most, methods, of, birth, control, used, in, antiquity, were, probably, ineffective, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, aristotle, c, 384, 322, bc, recommended, applying, cedar, oil, to, the, womb, before, intercourse, a, method, which, was, probably, only, effective, on, occasion, a, hippocratic, text, on, the, nature, of, women, recommended, that, a, woman, drink, a, copper, salt, dissolved, in, water, which, it, claimed, would, prevent, pregnancy, for, a, year, this, method, was, not, only, ineffective, but, also, dangerous, as, the, later, medical, writer, soranus, of, ephesus, c, 98, 138, ad, pointed, out, soranus, attempted, to, list, reliable, methods, of, birth, control, based, on, rational, principles, he, rejected, the, use, of, superstition, and, amulets, and, instead, prescribed, mechanical, methods, such, as, vaginal, plugs, and, pessaries, using, wool, as, a, base, covered, in, oils, or, other, gummy, substances, many, of, soranus, s, methods, were, probably, also, ineffective, in, medieval, europe, any, effort, to, halt, pregnancy, was, deemed, immoral, by, the, catholic, church, although, it, is, believed, that, women, of, the, time, still, used, a, number, of, birth, control, measures, such, as, coitus, interruptus, and, inserting, lily, root, and, rue, into, the, vagina, women, in, the, middle, ages, were, also, encouraged, to, tie, weasel, testicles, around, their, thighs, during, sex, to, prevent, pregnancy, the, oldest, condoms, discovered, to, date, were, recovered, in, the, ruins, of, dudley, castle, in, england, and, are, dated, back, to, 1640, they, were, made, of, animal, gut, and, were, most, likely, used, to, prevent, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, during, the, english, civil, war, casanova, living, in, 18th, century, italy, described, the, use, of, a, lambskin, covering, to, prevent, pregnancy, however, condoms, only, became, widely, available, in, the, 20th, century, the, birth, control, movement, developed, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, malthusian, league, based, on, the, ideas, of, thomas, malthus, was, established, in, 1877, in, the, united, kingdom, to, educate, the, public, about, the, importance, of, family, planning, and, to, advocate, for, getting, rid, of, penalties, for, promoting, birth, control, it, was, founded, during, the, knowlton, trial, of, annie, besant, and, charles, bradlaugh, who, were, prosecuted, for, publishing, on, various, methods, of, birth, control, in, the, united, states, margaret, sanger, and, otto, bobsein, popularized, the, phrase, birth, control, in, 1914, sanger, primarily, advocated, for, birth, control, on, the, idea, that, it, would, prevent, women, from, seeking, unsafe, abortions, but, during, her, lifetime, she, began, to, campaign, for, it, on, the, grounds, that, it, would, reduce, mental, and, physical, defects, she, was, mainly, active, in, the, united, states, but, had, gained, an, international, reputation, by, the, 1930s, at, the, time, under, the, comstock, law, distribution, of, birth, control, information, was, illegal, she, jumped, bail, in, 1914, after, her, arrest, for, distributing, birth, control, information, and, left, the, united, states, for, the, united, kingdom, in, the, u, k, sanger, influenced, by, havelock, ellis, further, developed, her, arguments, for, birth, control, she, believed, women, needed, to, enjoy, sex, without, fearing, a, pregnancy, during, her, time, abroad, sanger, also, saw, a, more, flexible, diaphragm, in, a, dutch, clinic, which, she, thought, was, a, better, form, of, contraceptive, once, sanger, returned, to, the, united, states, she, established, a, short, lived, birth, control, clinic, with, the, help, of, her, sister, ethel, bryne, based, in, the, brownville, section, of, brooklyn, new, york, in, 1916, it, was, shut, down, after, eleven, days, and, resulted, in, her, arrest, the, publicity, surrounding, the, arrest, trial, and, appeal, sparked, birth, control, activism, across, the, united, states, besides, her, sister, sanger, was, helped, in, the, movement, by, her, first, husband, william, sanger, who, distributed, copies, of, family, limitation, sanger, s, second, husband, james, noah, h, slee, would, also, later, become, involved, in, the, movement, acting, as, its, main, funder, sanger, also, contributed, to, the, funding, of, research, into, hormonal, contraceptives, in, the, 1950s, she, helped, fund, research, john, rock, and, biologist, gregory, pincus, that, resulted, in, the, first, hormonal, contraceptive, pill, later, called, enovid, the, first, human, trials, of, the, pill, were, done, on, patients, in, the, worcester, state, psychiatric, hospital, after, which, clinical, testing, was, done, in, puerto, rico, before, enovid, was, approved, for, use, in, the, u, s, the, people, participating, in, these, trials, were, not, fully, informed, on, the, medical, implications, of, the, pill, and, often, had, minimal, to, no, other, family, planning, options, the, newly, approved, birth, control, method, was, not, made, available, to, the, participants, after, the, trials, and, contraceptives, are, still, not, widely, accessible, in, puerto, rico, the, increased, use, of, birth, control, was, seen, by, some, as, a, form, of, social, decay, a, decrease, of, fertility, was, seen, as, a, negative, throughout, the, progressive, era, 1890, 1920, there, was, an, increase, of, voluntary, associations, aiding, the, contraceptive, movement, these, organizations, failed, to, enlist, more, than, 100, 000, women, because, the, use, of, birth, control, was, often, compared, to, eugenics, however, there, were, women, seeking, a, community, with, like, minded, women, the, ideology, that, surrounded, birth, control, started, to, gain, traction, during, the, progressive, era, due, to, voluntary, associations, establishing, community, birth, control, was, unlike, the, victorian, era, because, women, wanted, to, manage, their, sexuality, the, use, of, birth, control, was, another, form, of, self, interest, women, clung, to, this, was, seen, as, women, began, to, gravitate, towards, strong, figures, like, the, gibson, girl, the, first, permanent, birth, control, clinic, was, established, in, britain, in, 1921, by, marie, stopes, working, with, the, malthusian, league, the, clinic, run, by, midwives, and, supported, by, visiting, doctors, offered, women, s, birth, control, advice, and, taught, them, the, use, of, a, cervical, cap, her, clinic, made, contraception, acceptable, during, the, 1920s, by, presenting, it, in, scientific, terms, in, 1921, sanger, founded, the, american, birth, control, league, which, later, became, the, planned, parenthood, federation, of, america, in, 1924, the, society, for, the, provision, of, birth, control, clinics, was, founded, to, campaign, for, municipal, clinics, this, led, to, the, opening, of, a, second, clinic, in, greengate, salford, in, 1926, throughout, the, 1920s, stopes, and, other, feminist, pioneers, including, dora, russell, and, stella, browne, played, a, major, role, in, breaking, down, taboos, about, sex, in, april, 1930, the, birth, control, conference, assembled, 700, delegates, and, was, successful, in, bringing, birth, control, and, abortion, into, the, political, sphere, three, months, later, the, ministry, of, health, in, the, united, kingdom, allowed, local, authorities, to, give, birth, control, advice, in, welfare, centres, the, national, birth, control, association, was, founded, in, britain, in, 1931, and, became, the, family, planning, association, eight, years, later, the, association, amalgamated, several, british, birth, control, focused, groups, into, a, central, organisation, for, administering, and, overseeing, birth, control, in, britain, the, group, incorporated, the, birth, control, investigation, committee, a, collective, of, physicians, and, scientists, that, was, founded, to, investigate, scientific, and, medical, aspects, of, contraception, with, neutrality, and, impartiality, subsequently, the, association, effected, a, series, of, pure, and, applied, product, and, safety, standards, that, manufacturers, must, meet, to, ensure, their, contraceptives, could, be, prescribed, as, part, of, the, association, s, standard, two, part, technique, combining, a, rubber, appliance, to, protect, the, mouth, of, the, womb, with, a, chemical, preparation, capable, of, destroying, sperm, between, 1931, and, 1959, the, association, founded, and, funded, a, series, of, tests, to, assess, chemical, efficacy, and, safety, and, rubber, quality, these, tests, became, the, basis, for, the, association, s, approved, list, of, contraceptives, which, was, launched, in, 1937, and, went, on, to, become, an, annual, publication, that, the, expanding, network, of, fpa, clinics, relied, upon, as, a, means, to, establish, facts, and, to, publish, these, facts, as, a, basis, on, which, a, sound, public, and, scientific, opinion, can, be, built, in, 1936, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, second, circuit, ruled, in, united, states, v, one, package, of, japanese, pessaries, that, medically, prescribing, contraception, to, save, a, person, s, life, or, well, being, was, not, illegal, under, the, comstock, laws, following, this, decision, the, american, medical, association, committee, on, contraception, revoked, its, 1936, statement, condemning,

to, distribute, it, to, patients, meanwhile, gregory, pincus, and, john, rock, with, help, from, the, planned, parenthood, federation, of, america, developed, the, first, birth, control, pills, in, the, 1950s, such, as, mestranol, noretynodrel, which, became, publicly, available, in, the, 1960s, through, the, food, and, drug, administration, under, the, name, enovid, medical, abortion, became, an, alternative, to, surgical, abortion, with, the, availability, of, prostaglandin, analogs, in, the, 1970s, and, mifepristone, in, the, 1980s, human, rights, agreements, require, most, governments,

permissible, although, large, numbers, of, catholics, in, developed, countries, accept, and, use, modern, methods, of, birth, control, the, greek, orthodox, church, admits, a, possible, exception, to, its, traditional, teaching, forbidding, the, use, of, artificial, contraception, if, used, within, marriage, for, certain, purposes, including, the, spacing, of, births, among, protestants, there, is,
