pole, vaulting, also, known, as, pole, jumping, is, a, track, and, field, event, in, which, an, athlete, uses, a, long, and, flexible, pole, usually, made, from, fiberglass, or, carbon, fiber, as, an, aid, to, jump, over, a, bar, pole, jumping, was, already, practiced, by, the, ancient, egyptians, ancient, greeks, and, the, ancient, irish, people, although, modern, pole, vaulting, an, athletic, contest, where, height, is, measured, was, first, established, by, the, german, teacher, johann, christoph, friedrich, gutsmuths, in, the, 1790s, it, has, been, a, full, medal, event, at, the, olympic, games, since, 1896, for, men, and, since, 2000, for, women, it, is, typically, classified, as, one, of, the, four, major, jumping, events, in, athletics, alongside, the, high, jump, long, jump, and, triple, jump, it, is, unusual, among, track, and, field, sports, in, that, it, requires, a, significant, amount, of, specialised, equipment, in, order, to, participate, even, at, a, basic, level, a, number, of, elite, pole, vaulters, have, had, backgrounds, in, gymnastics, including, world, record, breakers, yelena, isinbayeva, and, brian, sternberg, reflecting, the, similar, physical, attributes, required, for, the, sports, physical, attributes, such, as, speed, agility, and, strength, along, with, technical, skill, are, essential, to, pole, vaulting, pole, jumping, was, already, practiced, by, the, ancient, egyptians, ancient, greeks, and, the, ancient, irish, people, as, depicted, on, stone, engravings, and, artifacts, dating, back, to, c, 2500, bc, the, egyptians, used, spears, to, mount, enemy, structures, and, to, pass, over, irrigation, ditches, vases, and, pots, from, greece, show, that, poles, were, used, by, the, locals, to, jump, onto, or, over, objects, from, c, 1800, bc, to, c, 550, bc, a, sport, akin, to, pole, vaulting, was, probably, included, in, the, irish, tailteann, games, although, the, pole, might, have, been, used, for, gaining, distance, rather, than, height, as, ancient, irish, farmers, used, poles, to, jump, over, canals, and, rivers, modern, pole, vaulting, an, athletic, contest, where, height, is, measured, was, first, established, by, the, german, teacher, johann, christoph, friedrich, gutsmuths, in, the, 1790s, gutsmuths, is, also, considered, by, many, to, be, the, father, of, modern, pole, vaulting, as, he, described, jumping, standards, the, distance, of, the, approach, recommendations, on, hand, grip, and, the, principles, of, pole, jumping, it, was, first, practiced, as, a, sport, in, germany, later, spreading, to, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, the, earliest, recorded, pole, vaulting, competition, in, england, where, height, was, measured, took, place, at, the, ulverston, football, and, cricket, club, lancashire, north, of, the, sands, in, 1843, pole, vault, was, one, of, the, athletics, events, of, the, inaugural, olympic, games, in, 1896, originally, poles, were, made, of, ash, and, from, hickory, wood, bamboo, poles, were, introduced, in, 1904, and, both, aluminum, and, steel, poles, appeared, after, 1945, glass, fiber, vaulting, poles, were, invented, in, 1967, by, james, monroe, lindler, of, the, columbia, products, company, columbia, south, carolina, an, application, filed, on, 10, march, 1967, was, granted, patent, status, on, 27, january, 1970, for, the, manufacture, of, a, vaulting, pole, of, hollow, construction, with, an, integral, helical, winding, and, a, method, of, manufacturing, the, same, see, us, patent, us3491999a, the, process, starts, with, a, metal, tube, referred, to, in, the, industry, as, a, mandrel, around, which, is, wound, a, tape, made, of, glass, fibers, impregnated, with, a, resin, this, is, baked, in, an, oven, and, after, cooling, the, mandrel, is, removed, to, leave, a, hollow, glass, fiber, tube, this, process, was, based, on, a, similar, method, used, for, manufacturing, glass, fiber, golf, clubs, patented, by, the, woolley, manufacturing, company, of, escondido, california, in, 1954, see, us, patent, us2822175a, in, september, 2005, jeffrey, p, watry, ralph, w, paquin, and, kenneth, a, hursey, of, gill, athletic, champaign, illinois, filed, application, to, patent, a, new, method, of, winding, the, glass, fibers, around, the, pole, in, layers, each, wound, in, a, different, direction, or, orientation, to, provide, specific, properties, to, various, parts, of, the, pole, this, was, called, carbon, weave, and, their, patent, was, granted, on, 21, october, 2008, see, us, patent, us3491999a, david, j, dodge, and, william, c, doble, of, the, alliance, design, and, development, group, of, new, york, city, new, york, were, granted, a, patent, in, 2006, for, the, manufacture, of, sports, equipment, having, a, tubular, structural, member, which, led, to, the, introduction, of, carbon, fiber, vaulting, poles, in, 2007, see, us, patent, us7140398b2, in, 2000, iaaf, rule, 260, 18a, formerly, 260, 6a, was, amended, so, that, world, records, as, opposed, to, indoor, world, records, can, be, set, in, a, facility, with, or, without, roof, this, rule, was, not, applied, retroactively, with, many, indoor, facilities, not, conforming, to, outdoor, track, specifications, for, size, and, flatness, the, pole, vault, was, the, only, world, record, set, indoors, until, 2022, today, athletes, compete, in, the, pole, vault, as, one, of, the, four, jumping, events, in, track, and, field, because, the, high, jump, and, pole, vault, are, both, vertical, jumps, the, competitions, are, conducted, similarly, each, athlete, can, choose, at, what, height, they, would, like, to, enter, the, competition, once, they, enter, they, have, three, attempts, to, clear, the, height, if, a, height, is, cleared, the, vaulter, advances, to, the, next, height, where, they, will, have, three, more, attempts, once, the, vaulter, has, three, consecutive, misses, they, are, out, of, the, competition, and, the, highest, height, they, cleared, is, their, result, a, no, height, often, denoted, nh, refers, to, the, failure, of, a, vaulter, to, clear, any, bar, during, the, competition, once, the, vaulter, enters, the, competition, they, can, choose, to, pass, heights, if, a, vaulter, achieves, a, miss, on, their, first, attempt, at, a, height, they, can, pass, to, the, next, height, but, they, will, only, have, two, attempts, at, that, height, as, they, will, be, out, once, they, achieve, three, consecutive, misses, similarly, after, earning, two, misses, at, a, height, they, could, pass, to, the, next, height, when, they, would, have, only, one, attempt, the, competitor, who, clears, the, highest, height, is, the, winner, if, two, or, more, vaulters, have, finished, with, the, same, height, the, tie, is, broken, by, the, number, of, misses, at, the, final, height, if, the, tied, vaulters, have, the, same, number, of, misses, at, the, last, height, cleared, the, tie, is, broken, by, the, total, number, of, misses, in, the, competition, if, there, is, still, a, tie, for, first, place, a, jump, off, occurs, to, break, the, tie, marks, achieved, in, this, type, of, jump, off, are, considered, valid, and, count, for, any, purpose, that, a, mark, achieved, in, a, normal, competition, would, if, a, tie, in, the, other, places, still, exists, a, jump, off, is, not, normally, conducted, unless, the, competition, is, a, qualifying, meet, and, the, tie, exists, in, the, final, qualifying, spot, in, this, case, an, administrative, jump, off, is, conducted, to, break, the, tie, but, the, marks, are, not, considered, valid, for, any, other, purpose, than, breaking, the, tie, a, jump, off, is, a, sudden, death, competition, in, which, the, tied, vaulters, attempt, the, same, height, starting, with, the, last, attempted, height, if, both, vaulters, miss, the, bar, goes, down, by, a, small, increment, and, if, both, clear, the, bar, goes, up, by, a, small, increment, a, jump, off, ends, when, one, vaulter, clears, and, the, other, misses, each, vaulter, gets, one, attempt, at, each, height, until, one, clears, and, one, misses, the, equipment, and, rules, for, pole, vaulting, are, similar, to, the, high, jump, unlike, high, jump, however, the, athlete, in, the, vault, has, the, ability, to, select, the, horizontal, position, of, the, bar, known, as, the, standards, before, each, jump, and, can, place, it, a, distance, beyond, the, back, of, the, box, the, metal, pit, that, the, pole, is, placed, into, immediately, before, takeoff, the, range, of, distance, the, vaulter, may, place, the, standards, varies, depending, on, the, level, of, competition, if, the, pole, used, by, the, athlete, dislodges, the, bar, from, the, uprights, a, foul, attempt, is, ruled, even, if, the, athlete, has, cleared, the, height, an, athlete, does, not, benefit, from, quickly, leaving, the, landing, pad, before, the, bar, has, fallen, the, exception, to, this, rule, is, if, the, vaulter, is, vaulting, outdoors, and, has, made, a, clear, effort, to, throw, the, pole, back, but, the, wind, has, blown, the, pole, into, the, bar, this, counts, as, a, clearance, this, call, is, made, at, the, discretion, of, the, pole, vault, official, if, the, pole, breaks, during, the, execution, of, a, vault, it, is, considered, an, equipment, failure, and, is, ruled, a, non, jump, neither, a, make, nor, a, miss, other, types, of, equipment, failure, include, the, standards, slipping, down, or, the, wind, dislodging, the, bar, when, no, contact, was, made, by, the, vaulter, each, athlete, has, a, set, amount, of, time, in, which, to, make, an, attempt, the, time, starts, when, the, official, deems, the, standards, to, be, set, ready, for, the, athlete, to, attempt, their, jump, when, every, athlete, is, still, in, the, competition, each, vaulter, has, one, minute, to, complete, their, jump, when, 3, athletes, are, remaining, the, time, moves, to, 2, minutes, 2, athletes, remaining, gets, 3, minutes, after, the, final, jumper, remains, he, or, she, gets, 5, minutes, on, the, runway, the, amount, of, time, varies, by, level, of, competition, and, the, number, of, vaulters, remaining, if, the, vaulter, fails, to, begin, an, attempt, within, this, time, the, vaulter, is, charged, with, a, time, foul, and, the, attempt, is, a, miss, poles, are, manufactured, with, ratings, corresponding, to, the, vaulter, s, maximum, weight, as, a, safety, precaution, some, organizations, forbid, use, of, poles, rated, below, the, vaulter, s, weight, the, recommended, weight, roughly, corresponds, to, a, flex, rating, that, is, determined, by, the, manufacturer, by, applying, a, standardized, amount, of, stress, most, commonly, a, 50, lb, 23, kg, weight, on, the, pole, and, measuring, how, much, the, center, of, the, pole, is, displaced, therefore, two, poles, rated, at, the, same, weight, are, not, necessarily, the, same, stiffness, pole, stiffness, and, length, are, important, factors, to, a, vaulter, s, performance, therefore, it, is, not, uncommon, for, an, elite, vaulter, to, carry, as, many, as, ten, poles, to, a, competition, the, effective, length, of, a, pole, can, be, changed, by, gripping, the, pole, higher, or, lower, in, relation, to, the, top, of, the, pole, the, left, and, right, handgrips, are, typically, a, bit, more, than, shoulder, width, apart, poles, are, manufactured, for, people, of, all, skill, levels, and, body, sizes, with, lengths, between, 3, 05, m, 10, ft, 0, in, and, 5, 30, m, 17, ft, 5, in, and, a, wide, range, of, weight, ratings, each, manufacturer, determines, the, weight, rating, for, the, pole, and, the, location, of, the, maximum, handhold, band, speed, is, an, essential, element, to, high, jumps, the, horizontal, kinetic, energy, produced, by, the, run, e, k, 1, 2, m, v, 2, displaystyle, e, k, frac, 1, 2, mv, 2, is, converted, to, vertical, propulsion, e, p, m, g, h, displaystyle, e, p, mgh, assuming, no, loss, of, energy, e, k, e, p, displaystyle, e, k, e, p, this, means, that, h, v, 2, 2, g, displaystyle, h, frac, v, 2, 2g, competitive, pole, vaulting, began, using, solid, ash, poles, as, the, heights, attained, increased, bamboo, poles, gave, way, to, tubular, aluminum, which, was, tapered, at, each, end, today, s, pole, vaulters, benefit, from, poles, produced, by, wrapping, pre, cut, sheets, of, fiberglass, that, contains, resin, around, a, metal, pole, mandrel, to, produce, a, slightly, curved, pole, that, bends, more, easily, under, the, compression, caused, by, an, athlete, s, take, off, the, shape, of, the, fiberglass, sheets, and, the, amount, of, fiberglass, used, is, carefully, planned, to, provide, the, desired, length, and, stiffness, of, pole, different, fiber, types, including, carbon, fiber, are, used, to, give, poles, specific, characteristics, intended, to, promote, higher, jumps, in, recent, years, carbon, fiber, has, been, added, to, the, commonly, used, e, glass, e, for, initial, electrical, use, and, s, glass, s, for, solid, materials, to, create, a, lighter, pole, as, in, the, high, jump, the, landing, area, was, originally, a, heap, of, sawdust, or, sand, where, athletes, landed, on, their, feet, as, technology, enabled, higher, vaults, mats, evolved, into, bags, of, large, chunks, of, foam, today, s, mats, are, foam, usually, 1, 1, 5, meters, 3, ft, 3, in, 4, ft, 11, in, thick, they, are, usually, built, up, with, two, cross, laid, square, section, logs, with, gaps, between, them, topped, by, a, solid, layer, of, foam, of, the, same, thickness, this, lattice, construction, is, wrapped, in, a, close, fitting, cover, topped, with, nylon, mesh, which, allows, some, air, to, escape, thus, combining, both, foam, and, a, measure, of, air, cushioning, the, final, layer, is, a, large, mat, of, mesh, covered, foam, which, is, clipped, around, the, edges, of, the, complete, pit, and, prevents, the, athlete, from, falling, between, the, individual, bags, mats, are, growing, larger, in, area, as, well, to, minimize, risk, of, injury, proper, landing, technique, is, on, the, back, or, shoulders, landing, on, the, feet, should, be, avoided, to, eliminate, the, risk, of, injury, to, the, lower, extremities, particularly, ankle, sprains, rule, changes, over, the, years, have, resulted, in, larger, landing, areas, and, additional, padding, of, all, hard, and, unyielding, surfaces, the, pole, vault, crossbar, has, evolved, from, a, triangular, aluminum, bar, to, a, round, fiberglass, bar, with, rubber, ends, this, is, balanced, on, standards, and, can, be, knocked, off, when, it, is, hit, by, a, pole, vaulter, or, the, pole, rule, changes, have, led, to, shorter, pegs, and, crossbar, ends, that, are, semi, circular, although, many, techniques, are, used, by, vaulters, at, various, skill, levels, to, clear, the, bar, the, generally, accepted, technical, model, can, be, broken, down, into, several, phases, during, the, approach, the, pole, vaulter, sprints, down, the, runway, in, such, a, way, as, to, achieve, maximum, speed, and, correct, position, to, initiate, takeoff, at, the, end, of, the, approach, a, tape, measure, is, laid, on, the, runway, so, vaulters, know, exactly, where, to, start, their, run, from, each, vaulter, has, a, certain, starting, distance, dependent, on, how, many, steps, away, from, the, box, they, start, top, class, vaulters, use, approaches, with, 18, to, 22, strides, often, referred, to, as, a, step, in, which, every, other, foot, is, counted, as, one, step, for, example, when, a, vaulter, takes, 18, strides, it, would, be, referred, to, as, a, 9, step, as, 22, strides, would, be, an, 11, step, the, run, up, to, the, vaulting, pit, begins, forcefully, with, the, vaulter, running, powerfully, in, a, relaxed, upright, position, with, knees, lifted, and, torso, leaning, very, slightly, forward, right, handed, vaulters, will, start, with, a, step, back, with, their, right, foot, before, starting, the, run, left, handed, vaulters, with, their, left, back, to, begin, the, head, shoulders, and, hips, are, aligned, the, vaulter, increasing, speed, as, the, body, becomes, erect, the, tip, of, the, vaulting, pole, is, angled, higher, than, eye, level, until, three, paces, from, takeoff, when, the, pole, tip, descends, efficiently, amplifying, run, speed, as, the, pole, is, planted, into, the, vault, box, the, faster, the, vaulter, can, run, and, the, more, efficient, their, take, off, is, the, greater, the, kinetic, energy, that, can, be, achieved, and, used, during, the, vault, the, plant, and, take, off, is, initiated, typically, three, steps, out, from, the, final, step, vaulters, will, usually, count, their, steps, backwards, from, their, starting, point, to, the, box, only, counting, the, steps, taken, on, the, left, foot, vice, versa, for, left, handers, for, example, a, vaulter, on, a, ten, count, referring, to, the, number, of, counted, steps, from, the, starting, point, to, the, box, would, count, backwards, from, ten, only, counting, the, steps, taken, with, the, left, foot, these, last, three, steps, are, normally, quicker, than, the, previous, strides, and, are, referred, to, as, the, turn, over, the, goal, of, this, phase, is, to, efficiently, translate, the, kinetic, energy, accumulated, from, the, approach, into, potential, energy, stored, by, the, elasticity, of, the, pole, and, to, gain, as, much, initial, vertical, height, as, possible, by, jumping, off, the, ground, the, plant, starts, with, the, vaulter, raising, their, arms, up, from, around, the, hips, or, mid, torso, until, they, are, fully, outstretched, above, the, head, with, the, right, arm, extended, directly, above, the, head, and, the, left, arm, extended, perpendicular, to, the, pole, vice, versa, for, left, handed, vaulters, at, the, same, time, the, vaulter, is, dropping, the, pole, tip, into, the, box, on, the, final, step, the, vaulter, jumps, off, the, trail, leg, which, should, always, remain, straight, and, then, drives, the, front, knee, forward, as, the, pole, slides, into, the, back, of, the, box, the, pole, begins, to, bend, and, the, vaulter, continues, up, and, forward, leaving, the, trail, leg, angled, down, and, behind, the, body, in, a, backwards, c, position, the, swing, and, row, simply, consists, of, the, vaulter, swinging, the, trail, leg, forward, and, rowing, the, pole, bringing, the, top, arm, down, to, the, hips, while, trying, to, keep, the, trail, leg, straight, to, store, more, potential, energy, into, the, pole, the, rowing, motion, also, keeps, the, pole, bent, for, a, longer, period, of, time, for, the, vaulter, to, get, into, optimum, position, when, parallel, to, the, pole, the, left, arm, hugs, the, pole, tight, to, efficiently, use, the, recoil, within, the, pole, the, goal, is, to, carry, out, these, motions, as, thoroughly, and, as, quickly, as, possible, it, is, a, race, against, the, unbending, of, the, pole, effectively, this, causes, a, double, pendulum, motion, with, the, top, of, the, pole, moving, forward, and, pivoting, from, the, box, while, the, vaulter, acts, as, a, second, pendulum, pivoting, from, the, right, hand, this, action, gives, the, vaulter, the, best, position, possible, to, be, ejected, off, the, pole, the, swing, continues, until, the, hips, are, above, the, head, and, the, arms, are, pulling, the, pole, close, to, the, chest, from, there, the, vaulter, shoots, their, legs, up, over, the, cross, bar, while, keeping, the, pole, close, the, extension, refers, to, the, extension, of, the, hips, upward, with, outstretched, legs, as, the, shoulders, drive, down, causing, the, vaulter, to, be, positioned, upside, down, this, position, is, often, referred, to, as, inversion, while, this, phase, is, executed, the, pole, begins, to, recoil, propelling, the, vaulter, quickly, upward, the, hands, of, the, vaulter, remain, close, to, the, body, as, they, move, from, the, shins, back, to, the, region, around, the, hips, and, upper, torso, the, turn, is, executed, immediately, during, the, end, of, the, rockback, as, the, name, implies, the, vaulter, turns, 180, toward, the, pole, while, extending, the, arms, down, past, the, head, and, shoulders, typically, the, vaulter, will, begin, to, angle, their, body, toward, the, bar, as, the, turn, is, executed, although, ideally, the, vaulter, will, remain, as, vertical, as, possible, a, more, accurate, description, of, this, phase, of, the, vault, may, be, the, spin, because, the, vaulter, spins, around, an, imaginary, axis, from, head, to, toe, this, is, often, highly, emphasized, by, spectators, and, novice, vaulters, but, it, is, the, easiest, phase, of, the, vault, and, is, a, result, of, proper, execution, of, previous, phases, this, phase, mainly, consists, of, the, vaulter, pushing, off, the, pole, and, releasing, it, so, the, pole, falls, away, from, the, crossbar, and, mats, as, the, torso, goes, over, and, around, the, crossbar, the, vaulter, is, facing, the, crossbar, rotation, of, the, body, over, the, bar, occurs, naturally, and, the, vaulter, s, main, concern, is, making, sure, that, his, arms, face, and, any, other, appendages, do, not, knock, the, bar, off, as, they, go, over, vaulters, aim, to, whip, their, upper, torso, around, the, top, of, the, cross, bar, to, ensure, their, elbows, and, face, do, not, knock, it, off, the, elite, vaulter, s, center, of, gravity, passes, underneath, the, crossbar, when, they, have, their, hips, in, the, highest, position, like, the, crotch, of, an, upside, down, v, the, vaulter, should, land, near, the, middle, of, the, foam, landing, mats, or, pit, face, up, landing, on, the, feet, or, stomach, first, may, lead, to, injuries, or, other, problems, the, six, metres, club, consists, of, pole, vaulters, who, have, reached, at, least, 6, 00, m, 19, ft, 8, in, in, 1985, sergey, bubka, became, the, first, pole, vaulter, to, clear, six, metres, four, women, have, cleared, 5, metres, yelena, isinbayeva,
