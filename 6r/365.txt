curling, is, a, sport, in, which, players, slide, stones, on, a, sheet, of, ice, toward, a, target, area, which, is, segmented, into, four, concentric, circles, it, is, related, to, bowls, boules, and, shuffleboard, two, teams, each, with, four, players, take, turns, sliding, heavy, polished, granite, stones, also, called, rocks, across, the, ice, curling, sheet, toward, the, house, a, circular, target, marked, on, the, ice, each, team, has, eight, stones, with, each, player, throwing, two, the, purpose, is, to, accumulate, the, highest, score, for, a, game, points, are, scored, for, the, stones, resting, closest, to, the, centre, of, the, house, at, the, conclusion, of, each, end, which, is, completed, when, both, teams, have, thrown, all, of, their, stones, once, a, game, usually, consists, of, eight, or, ten, ends, players, induce, a, curved, path, described, as, curl, by, causing, the, stone, to, slowly, rotate, as, it, slides, the, path, of, the, rock, may, be, further, influenced, by, two, sweepers, with, brooms, or, brushes, who, accompany, it, as, it, slides, down, the, sheet, and, sweep, the, ice, in, front, of, the, stone, sweeping, a, rock, decreases, the, friction, which, makes, the, stone, travel, a, straighter, path, with, less, curl, and, a, longer, distance, a, great, deal, of, strategy, and, teamwork, go, into, choosing, the, ideal, path, and, placement, of, a, stone, for, each, situation, and, the, skills, of, the, curlers, determine, the, degree, to, which, the, stone, will, achieve, the, desired, result, evidence, that, curling, existed, in, scotland, in, the, early, 16th, century, includes, a, curling, stone, inscribed, with, the, date, 1511, found, along, with, another, bearing, the, date, 1551, when, an, old, pond, was, drained, at, dunblane, scotland, the, world, s, oldest, curling, stone, and, the, world, s, oldest, football, are, now, kept, in, the, same, museum, the, stirling, smith, art, gallery, and, museum, in, stirling, the, first, written, reference, to, a, contest, using, stones, on, ice, coming, from, the, records, of, paisley, abbey, renfrewshire, in, february, 1541, two, paintings, winter, landscape, with, a, bird, trap, and, the, hunters, in, the, snow, both, dated, 1565, by, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, depict, flemish, peasants, curling, albeit, without, brooms, scotland, and, the, low, countries, had, strong, trading, and, cultural, links, during, this, period, which, is, also, evident, in, the, history, of, golf, the, word, curling, first, appears, in, print, in, 1620, in, perth, scotland, in, the, preface, and, the, verses, of, a, poem, by, henry, adamson, the, sport, was, and, still, is, in, scotland, and, scottish, settled, regions, like, southern, new, zealand, also, known, as, the, roaring, game, because, of, the, sound, the, stones, make, while, traveling, over, the, pebble, droplets, of, water, applied, to, the, playing, surface, the, verbal, noun, curling, is, formed, from, the, scots, and, english, verb, curl, which, describes, the, motion, of, the, stone, kilsyth, curling, club, claims, to, be, the, first, club, in, the, world, having, been, formally, constituted, in, 1716, it, is, still, in, existence, today, kilsyth, also, claims, the, oldest, purpose, built, curling, pond, in, the, world, at, colzium, in, the, form, of, a, low, dam, creating, a, shallow, pool, some, 100, by, 250, metres, 330, by, 820, ft, in, size, the, international, olympic, committee, recognises, the, royal, caledonian, curling, club, founded, as, the, grand, caledonian, curling, club, in, 1838, as, developing, the, first, official, rules, for, the, sport, however, although, not, written, as, a, rule, book, this, is, preceded, by, rev, james, ramsay, of, gladsmuir, a, member, of, the, duddingston, curling, club, who, wrote, an, account, of, the, game, of, curling, in, 1811, which, speculates, on, its, origin, and, explains, the, method, of, play, in, the, early, history, of, curling, the, playing, stones, were, simply, flat, bottomed, stones, from, rivers, or, fields, which, lacked, a, handle, and, were, of, inconsistent, size, shape, and, smoothness, some, early, stones, had, holes, for, a, finger, and, the, thumb, akin, to, ten, pin, bowling, balls, unlike, today, the, thrower, had, little, control, over, the, curl, or, velocity, and, relied, more, on, luck, than, on, precision, skill, and, strategy, the, sport, was, often, played, on, frozen, rivers, although, purpose, built, ponds, were, later, created, in, many, scottish, towns, for, example, the, scottish, poet, david, gray, describes, whisky, drinking, curlers, on, the, luggie, water, at, kirkintilloch, in, darvel, east, ayrshire, the, weavers, relaxed, by, playing, curling, matches, using, the, heavy, stone, weights, from, the, looms, warp, beams, fitted, with, a, detachable, handle, for, the, purpose, central, canadian, curlers, often, used, irons, rather, than, stones, until, the, early, 1900s, canada, is, the, only, country, known, to, have, done, so, while, others, experimented, with, wood, or, ice, filled, tins, outdoor, curling, was, very, popular, in, scotland, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, because, the, climate, provided, good, ice, conditions, every, winter, scotland, is, home, to, the, international, governing, body, for, curling, the, world, curling, federation, in, perth, which, originated, as, a, committee, of, the, royal, caledonian, curling, club, the, mother, club, of, curling, in, the, 19th, century, several, private, railway, stations, in, the, united, kingdom, were, built, to, serve, curlers, attending, bonspiels, such, as, those, at, aboyne, carsbreck, and, drummuir, today, the, sport, is, most, firmly, established, in, canada, having, been, taken, there, by, scottish, emigrants, the, royal, montreal, curling, club, the, oldest, established, sports, club, still, active, in, north, america, was, established, in, 1807, the, first, curling, club, in, the, united, states, was, established, in, 1830, and, the, sport, was, introduced, to, switzerland, and, sweden, before, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, also, by, scots, today, curling, is, played, all, over, europe, and, has, spread, to, brazil, japan, australia, new, zealand, china, and, korea, the, first, world, championship, for, curling, was, limited, to, men, and, was, known, as, the, scotch, cup, held, in, falkirk, and, edinburgh, scotland, in, 1959, the, first, world, title, was, won, by, the, canadian, team, from, regina, saskatchewan, skipped, by, ernie, richardson, the, skip, is, the, team, member, who, calls, the, shots, see, below, curling, has, been, a, medal, sport, in, the, winter, olympic, games, since, the, 1998, winter, olympics, it, currently, includes, men, s, women, s, and, mixed, doubles, tournaments, the, mixed, doubles, event, was, held, for, the, first, time, in, 2018, in, february, 2002, the, international, olympic, committee, retroactively, decided, that, the, curling, competition, from, the, 1924, winter, olympics, originally, called, semaine, des, sports, d, hiver, or, international, winter, sports, week, would, be, considered, official, olympic, events, and, no, longer, be, considered, demonstration, events, thus, the, first, olympic, medals, in, curling, which, at, the, time, was, played, outdoors, were, retroactively, awarded, for, the, 1924, winter, games, with, the, gold, medal, won, by, great, britain, two, silver, medals, by, sweden, and, the, bronze, by, france, a, demonstration, tournament, was, also, held, during, the, 1932, winter, olympic, games, between, four, teams, from, canada, and, four, teams, from, the, united, states, with, canada, winning, 12, games, to, 4, since, the, sport, s, official, addition, in, the, 1998, olympics, canada, has, dominated, the, sport, with, their, men, s, teams, winning, gold, in, 2006, 2010, and, 2014, and, silver, in, 1998, and, 2002, the, women, s, team, won, gold, in, 1998, and, 2014, a, silver, in, 2010, and, a, bronze, in, 2002, and, 2006, the, mixed, doubles, team, won, gold, in, 2018, the, playing, surface, or, curling, sheet, is, defined, by, the, world, curling, federation, rules, of, curling, it, is, a, rectangular, area, of, ice, carefully, prepared, to, be, as, flat, and, level, as, possible, 146, to, 150, feet, 45, to, 46, m, in, length, by, 14, 5, to, 16, 5, feet, 4, 4, to, 5, 0, m, in, width, the, shorter, borders, of, the, sheet, are, called, the, backboards, a, target, the, house, is, centred, on, the, intersection, of, the, centre, line, drawn, lengthwise, down, the, centre, of, the, sheet, and, the, tee, line, drawn, 16, feet, 4, 9, m, from, and, parallel, to, the, backboard, these, lines, divide, the, house, into, quarters, the, house, consists, of, a, centre, circle, the, button, and, three, concentric, rings, of, diameters, 4, 8, and, 12, feet, formed, by, painting, or, laying, a, coloured, vinyl, sheet, under, the, ice, and, are, usually, distinguished, by, colour, a, stone, must, at, least, touch, the, outer, ring, in, order, to, score, see, scoring, below, otherwise, the, rings, are, merely, a, visual, aid, for, aiming, and, judging, which, stone, is, closer, to, the, button, two, hog, lines, are, drawn, 37, feet, 11, m, from, and, parallel, to, the, backboard, the, hacks, which, give, the, thrower, something, to, push, against, when, making, the, throw, are, fixed, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, behind, each, button, on, indoor, rinks, there, are, usually, two, fixed, hacks, rubber, lined, holes, one, on, each, side, of, the, centre, line, with, the, inside, edge, no, more, than, 3, inches, 76, mm, from, the, centre, line, and, the, front, edge, on, the, hack, line, a, single, moveable, hack, may, also, be, used, the, ice, may, be, natural, but, is, usually, frozen, by, a, refrigeration, plant, pumping, a, brine, solution, through, numerous, pipes, fixed, lengthwise, at, the, bottom, of, a, shallow, pan, of, water, most, curling, clubs, have, an, ice, maker, whose, main, job, is, to, care, for, the, ice, at, the, major, curling, championships, ice, maintenance, is, extremely, important, large, events, such, as, national, international, championships, are, typically, held, in, an, arena, that, presents, a, challenge, to, the, ice, maker, who, must, constantly, monitor, and, adjust, the, ice, and, air, temperatures, as, well, as, air, humidity, levels, to, ensure, a, consistent, playing, surface, it, is, common, for, each, sheet, of, ice, to, have, multiple, sensors, embedded, in, order, to, monitor, surface, temperature, as, well, as, probes, set, up, in, the, seating, area, to, monitor, humidity, and, in, the, compressor, room, to, monitor, brine, supply, and, return, temperatures, the, surface, of, the, ice, is, maintained, at, a, temperature, of, around, 23, f, 5, c, a, key, part, of, the, preparation, of, the, playing, surface, is, the, spraying, of, water, droplets, onto, the, ice, which, form, pebble, on, freezing, the, pebbled, ice, surface, resembles, an, orange, peel, and, the, stone, moves, on, top, of, the, pebbled, ice, the, pebble, along, with, the, concave, bottom, of, the, stone, decreases, the, friction, between, the, stone, and, the, ice, allowing, the, stone, to, travel, farther, as, the, stone, moves, over, the, pebble, any, rotation, of, the, stone, causes, it, to, curl, or, travel, along, a, curved, path, the, amount, of, curl, commonly, referred, to, as, the, feet, of, curl, can, change, during, a, game, as, the, pebble, wears, the, ice, maker, must, monitor, this, and, be, prepared, to, scrape, and, re, pebble, the, surface, prior, to, each, game, the, curling, stone, also, sometimes, called, a, rock, in, north, america, is, made, of, granite, and, is, specified, by, the, world, curling, federation, which, requires, a, weight, between, 19, 96, and, 17, 24, kilograms, 44, and, 38, lb, a, maximum, circumference, of, 914, millimetres, 36, in, and, a, minimum, height, of, 114, millimetres, 4, 1, 2, in, the, only, part, of, the, stone, in, contact, with, the, ice, is, the, running, surface, a, narrow, flat, annulus, or, ring, 6, 4, to, 12, 7, millimetres, 1, 4, to, 1, 2, in, wide, and, about, 130, millimetres, 5, in, in, diameter, the, sides, of, the, stone, bulge, convex, down, to, the, ring, with, the, inside, of, the, ring, hollowed, concave, to, clear, the, ice, this, concave, bottom, was, first, proposed, by, j, s, russell, of, toronto, ontario, canada, sometime, after, 1870, and, was, subsequently, adopted, by, scottish, stone, manufacturer, andrew, kay, the, granite, for, the, stones, comes, from, two, sources, ailsa, craig, an, island, off, the, ayrshire, coast, of, scotland, and, the, trefor, granite, quarry, north, of, the, ll, n, peninsula, gwynedd, in, wales, these, locations, provide, four, variations, in, colour, known, as, ailsa, craig, common, green, ailsa, craig, blue, hone, blue, trefor, and, red, trefor, blue, hone, has, very, low, water, absorption, which, prevents, the, action, of, repeatedly, freezing, water, from, eroding, the, stone, ailsa, craig, common, green, is, a, lesser, quality, granite, than, blue, hone, in, the, past, most, curling, stones, were, made, from, blue, hone, but, the, island, is, now, a, wildlife, reserve, and, the, quarry, is, restricted, by, environmental, conditions, that, exclude, blasting, kays, of, scotland, has, been, making, curling, stones, in, mauchline, ayrshire, since, 1851, and, has, the, exclusive, rights, to, the, ailsa, craig, granite, granted, by, the, marquess, of, ailsa, whose, family, has, owned, the, island, since, 1560, according, to, the, 1881, census, andrew, kay, employed, 30, people, in, his, curling, stone, factory, in, mauchline, the, last, harvest, of, ailsa, craig, granite, by, kays, took, place, in, 2013, after, a, hiatus, of, 11, years, 2, 000, tons, were, harvested, sufficient, to, fill, anticipated, orders, through, at, least, 2020, kays, have, been, involved, in, providing, curling, stones, for, the, winter, olympics, since, chamonix, in, 1924, and, has, been, the, exclusive, manufacturer, of, curling, stones, for, the, olympics, since, the, 2006, winter, olympics, trefor, granite, comes, from, the, yr, eifl, or, trefor, granite, quarry, in, the, village, of, trefor, on, the, north, coast, of, the, ll, n, peninsula, in, gwynedd, wales, and, has, produced, granite, since, 1850, trefor, granite, comes, in, shades, of, pink, blue, and, grey, the, quarry, supplies, curling, stone, granite, exclusively, to, the, canada, curling, stone, company, which, has, been, producing, stones, since, 1992, and, supplied, the, stones, for, the, 2002, winter, olympics, a, handle, is, attached, by, a, bolt, running, vertically, through, a, hole, in, the, centre, of, the, stone, the, handle, allows, the, stone, to, be, gripped, and, rotated, upon, release, on, properly, prepared, ice, the, rotation, will, bend, curl, the, path, of, the, stone, in, the, direction, in, which, the, front, edge, of, the, stone, is, turning, especially, as, the, stone, slows, handles, are, coloured, to, identify, each, team, two, popular, colours, in, major, tournaments, being, red, and, yellow, in, competition, an, electronic, handle, known, as, the, eye, on, the, hog, may, be, fitted, to, detect, hog, line, violations, this, electronically, detects, whether, the, thrower, s, hand, is, in, contact, with, the, handle, as, it, passes, the, hog, line, and, indicates, a, violation, by, lights, at, the, base, of, the, handle, see, delivery, below, the, eye, on, the, hog, eliminates, human, error, and, the, need, for, hog, line, officials, it, is, mandatory, in, high, level, national, and, international, competition, but, its, cost, around, us, 650, each, currently, puts, it, beyond, the, reach, of, most, curling, clubs, the, curling, broom, or, brush, is, used, to, sweep, the, ice, surface, in, the, path, of, the, stone, see, sweeping, and, is, also, often, used, as, a, balancing, aid, during, delivery, of, the, stone, prior, to, the, 1950s, most, curling, brooms, were, made, of, corn, strands, and, were, similar, to, household, brooms, of, the, day, in, 1958, fern, marchessault, of, montreal, inverted, the, corn, straw, in, the, centre, of, the, broom, this, style, of, corn, broom, was, referred, to, as, the, blackjack, artificial, brooms, made, from, human, made, fabrics, rather, than, corn, such, as, the, rink, rat, also, became, common, later, during, this, time, period, prior, to, the, late, sixties, scottish, curling, brushes, were, used, primarily, by, some, of, the, scots, as, well, as, by, recreational, and, elderly, curlers, as, a, substitute, for, corn, brooms, since, the, technique, was, easier, to, learn, in, the, late, sixties, competitive, curlers, from, calgary, alberta, such, as, john, mayer, bruce, stewart, and, later, the, world, junior, championship, teams, skipped, by, paul, gowsell, proved, that, the, curling, brush, could, be, just, as, or, more, effective, without, all, the, blisters, common, to, corn, broom, use, during, that, time, period, there, was, much, debate, in, competitive, curling, circles, as, to, which, sweeping, device, was, more, effective, brush, or, broom, eventually, the, brush, won, out, with, the, majority, of, curlers, making, the, switch, to, the, less, costly, and, more, efficient, brush, today, brushes, have, replaced, traditional, corn, brooms, at, every, level, of, curling, it, is, rare, now, to, see, a, curler, using, a, corn, broom, on, a, regular, basis, curling, brushes, may, have, fabric, hog, hair, or, horsehair, heads, modern, curling, brush, handles, are, usually, hollow, tubes, made, of, fibreglass, or, carbon, fibre, instead, of, a, solid, length, of, wooden, dowel, these, hollow, tube, handles, are, lighter, and, stronger, than, wooden, handles, allowing, faster, sweeping, and, more, downward, force, to, be, applied, to, the, broom, head, with, reduced, shaft, flex, in, 2014, new, directional, fabric, brooms, were, introduced, which, could, influence, the, path, of, a, curling, stone, better, than, the, existing, brooms, concerns, arose, that, these, brooms, would, alter, the, fundamentals, of, the, sport, by, reducing, the, level, of, skill, required, and, giving, players, an, unfair, advantage, at, least, thirty, four, elite, teams, signed, a, statement, pledging, not, to, use, them, this, was, dubbed, the, broomgate, controversy, the, new, brooms, were, temporarily, banned, by, the, world, curling, federation, and, curling, canada, for, the, 2015, 2016, season, since, 2016, only, one, standardized, brush, head, is, approved, by, the, world, curling, federation, for, competitive, play, curling, shoes, are, similar, to, ordinary, athletic, shoes, except, for, special, soles, the, slider, shoe, usually, known, as, a, slider, is, designed, for, the, sliding, foot, and, the, gripper, shoe, usually, known, as, a, gripper, for, the, foot, that, kicks, off, from, the, hack, the, slider, is, designed, to, slide, and, typically, has, a, teflon, sole, it, is, worn, by, the, thrower, during, delivery, from, the, hack, and, by, sweepers, or, the, skip, to, glide, down, the, ice, when, sweeping, or, otherwise, traveling, down, the, sheet, quickly, stainless, steel, and, red, brick, sliders, with, lateral, blocks, of, pvc, on, the, sole, are, also, available, as, alternatives, to, teflon, most, shoes, have, a, full, sole, sliding, surface, but, some, shoes, have, a, sliding, surface, covering, only, the, outline, of, the, shoe, and, other, enhancements, with, the, full, sole, slider, some, shoes, have, small, disc, sliders, covering, the, front, and, heel, portions, or, only, the, front, portion, of, the, foot, which, allow, more, flexibility, in, the, sliding, foot, for, curlers, playing, with, tuck, deliveries, when, a, player, is, not, throwing, the, player, s, slider, shoe, can, be, temporarily, rendered, non, slippery, by, using, a, slip, on, gripper, ordinary, athletic, shoes, may, be, converted, to, sliders, by, using, a, step, on, or, slip, on, teflon, slider, or, by, applying, electrical, or, gaffer, tape, directly, to, the, sole, or, over, a, piece, of, cardboard, this, arrangement, often, suits, casual, or, beginning, players, the, gripper, is, worn, by, the, thrower, on, the, foot, that, kicks, off, from, the, hack, during, delivery, and, is, designed, to, grip, the, ice, it, may, have, a, normal, athletic, shoe, sole, or, a, special, layer, of, rubbery, material, applied, to, the, sole, of, a, thickness, to, match, the, sliding, shoe, the, toe, of, the, hack, foot, shoe, may, also, have, a, rubberised, coating, on, the, top, surface, or, a, flap, that, hangs, over, the, toe, to, reduce, wear, on, the, top, of, the, shoe, as, it, drags, on, the, ice, behind, the, thrower, other, types, of, equipment, include, the, purpose, of, a, game, is, to, score, points, by, getting, stones, closer, to, the, house, centre, or, the, button, than, the, other, team, s, stones, players, from, either, team, alternate, in, taking, shots, from, the, far, side, of, the, sheet, an, end, is, complete, when, all, eight, rocks, from, each, team, have, been, delivered, a, total, of, sixteen, stones, if, the, teams, are, tied, at, the, end, of, regulation, often, extra, ends, are, played, to, break, the, tie, the, winner, is, the, team, with, the, highest, score, after, all, ends, have, been, completed, see, scoring, below, a, game, may, be, conceded, if, winning, the, game, is, infeasible, international, competitive, games, are, generally, ten, ends, so, most, of, the, national, championships, that, send, a, representative, to, the, world, championships, or, olympics, also, play, ten, ends, however, there, is, a, movement, on, the, world, curling, tour, to, make, the, games, only, eight, ends, most, tournaments, on, that, tour, are, eight, ends, as, are, the, vast, majority, of, recreational, games, in, international, competition, each, side, is, given, 73, minutes, to, complete, all, of, its, throws, each, team, is, also, allowed, two, minute, long, timeouts, per, 10, end, game, if, extra, ends, are, required, each, team, is, allowed, 10, minutes, of, playing, time, to, complete, its, throws, and, one, added, 60, second, timeout, for, each, extra, end, however, the, thinking, time, system, in, which, the, delivering, team, s, game, timer, stops, as, soon, as, the, shooter, s, rock, crosses, the, t, line, during, the, delivery, is, becoming, more, popular, especially, in, canada, this, system, allows, each, team, 38, minutes, per, 10, ends, or, 30, minutes, per, 8, ends, to, make, strategic, and, tactical, decisions, with, 4, minutes, and, 30, seconds, an, end, for, extra, ends, the, thinking, time, system, was, implemented, after, it, was, recognized, that, using, shots, which, take, more, time, for, the, stones, to, come, to, rest, was, being, penalized, in, terms, of, the, time, the, teams, had, available, compared, to, teams, which, primarily, use, hits, which, require, far, less, time, per, shot, the, process, of, sliding, a, stone, down, the, sheet, is, known, as, the, delivery, or, throw, players, with, the, exception, of, the, skip, take, turns, throwing, and, sweeping, when, one, player, e, g, the, lead, throws, the, players, not, delivering, the, second, and, third, sweep, see, sweeping, below, when, the, skip, throws, the, vice, skip, takes, their, role, the, skip, or, the, captain, of, the, team, determines, the, desired, stone, placement, and, the, required, weight, turn, and, line, that, will, allow, the, stone, to, stop, there, the, placement, will, be, influenced, by, the, tactics, at, this, point, in, the, game, which, may, involve, taking, out, blocking, or, tapping, another, stone, the, skip, may, communicate, the, weight, turn, line, and, other, tactics, by, calling, or, tapping, a, broom, on, the, ice, in, the, case, of, a, takeout, guard, or, a, tap, the, skip, will, indicate, the, stones, involved, before, delivery, the, running, surface, of, the, stone, is, wiped, clean, and, the, path, across, the, ice, swept, with, the, broom, if, necessary, since, any, dirt, on, the, bottom, of, a, stone, or, in, its, path, can, alter, the, trajectory, and, ruin, the, shot, intrusion, by, a, foreign, object, is, called, a, pick, up, or, pick, the, thrower, starts, from, the, hack, the, thrower, s, gripper, shoe, with, the, non, slippery, sole, is, positioned, against, one, of, the, hacks, for, a, right, handed, curler, the, right, foot, is, placed, against, the, left, hack, and, vice, versa, for, a, left, hander, the, thrower, now, in, the, hack, lines, the, body, up, with, shoulders, square, to, the, skip, s, broom, at, the, far, end, for, line, the, stone, is, placed, in, front, of, the, foot, now, in, the, hack, rising, slightly, from, the, hack, the, thrower, pulls, the, stone, back, some, older, curlers, may, actually, raise, the, stone, in, this, backward, movement, then, lunges, smoothly, out, from, the, hack, pushing, the, stone, ahead, while, the, slider, foot, is, moved, in, front, of, the, gripper, foot, which, trails, behind, the, thrust, from, this, lunge, determines, the, weight, and, hence, the, distance, the, stone, will, travel, balance, may, be, assisted, by, a, broom, held, in, the, free, hand, with, the, back, of, the, broom, down, so, that, it, slides, one, older, writer, suggests, the, player, keep, a, basilisk, glance, at, the, mark, there, are, two, common, types, of, delivery, currently, the, typical, flat, foot, delivery, and, the, manitoba, tuck, delivery, where, the, curler, slides, on, the, front, ball, of, their, foot, when, the, player, releases, the, stone, a, rotation, called, the, turn, is, imparted, by, a, slight, clockwise, or, counter, clockwise, twist, of, the, handle, from, around, the, two, or, ten, o, clock, position, to, the, twelve, o, clock, on, release, a, typical, rate, of, turn, is, about, 2, 1, 2, rotations, before, coming, to, a, rest, the, stone, must, be, released, before, its, front, edge, crosses, the, near, hog, line, in, major, tournaments, the, eye, on, the, hog, sensor, is, commonly, used, to, enforce, this, rule, the, sensor, is, in, the, handle, of, the, stone, and, will, indicate, whether, the, stone, was, released, before, the, near, hog, line, the, lights, on, the, stone, handle, will, either, light, up, green, indicating, that, the, stone, has, been, legally, thrown, or, red, in, which, case, the, illegally, thrown, stone, will, be, immediately, pulled, from, play, instead, of, waiting, for, the, stone, to, come, to, rest, the, stone, must, clear, the, far, hog, line, or, else, be, removed, from, play, hogged, an, exception, is, made, if, a, stone, fails, to, come, to, rest, beyond, the, far, hog, line, after, rebounding, from, a, stone, in, play, just, past, the, hog, line, after, the, stone, is, delivered, its, trajectory, is, influenced, by, the, two, sweepers, under, instruction, from, the, skip, sweeping, is, done, for, several, reasons, to, make, the, stone, travel, farther, to, decrease, the, amount, of, curl, and, to, clean, debris, from, the, stone, s, path, sweeping, is, able, to, make, the, stone, travel, farther, and, straighter, by, slightly, melting, the, ice, under, the, brooms, thus, decreasing, the, friction, as, the, stone, travels, across, that, part, of, the, ice, the, stones, curl, more, as, they, slow, down, so, sweeping, early, in, travel, tends, to, increase, distance, as, well, as, straighten, the, path, and, sweeping, after, sideways, motion, is, established, can, increase, the, sideways, distance, one, of, the, basic, technical, aspects, of, curling, is, knowing, when, to, sweep, when, the, ice, in, front, of, the, stone, is, swept, a, stone, will, usually, travel, both, farther, and, straighter, and, in, some, situations, one, of, those, is, not, desirable, for, example, a, stone, may, be, traveling, too, fast, said, to, have, too, much, weight, but, require, sweeping, to, prevent, curling, into, another, stone, the, team, must, decide, which, is, better, getting, by, the, other, stone, but, traveling, too, far, or, hitting, the, stone, much, of, the, yelling, that, goes, on, during, a, curling, game, is, the, skip, and, sweepers, exchanging, information, about, the, stone, s, line, and, weight, and, deciding, whether, to, sweep, the, skip, evaluates, the, path, of, the, stone, and, calls, to, the, sweepers, to, sweep, as, necessary, to, maintain, the, intended, track, the, sweepers, themselves, are, responsible, for, judging, the, weight, of, the, stone, ensuring, that, the, length, of, travel, is, correct, and, communicating, the, weight, of, the, stone, back, to, the, skip, many, teams, use, a, number, system, to, communicate, in, which, of, 10, zones, the, sweepers, estimate, the, stone, will, stop, some, sweepers, use, stopwatches, to, time, the, stone, from, the, back, line, or, tee, line, to, the, nearest, hog, line, to, aid, in, estimating, how, far, the, stone, will, travel, usually, the, two, sweepers, will, be, on, opposite, sides, of, the, stone, s, path, although, depending, on, which, side, the, sweepers, strengths, lie, this, may, not, always, be, the, case, speed, and, pressure, are, vital, to, sweeping, in, gripping, the, broom, one, hand, should, be, one, third, of, the, way, from, the, top, non, brush, end, of, the, handle, while, the, other, hand, should, be, one, third, of, the, way, from, the, head, of, the, broom, the, angle, of, the, broom, to, the, ice, should, be, such, that, the, most, force, possible, can, be, exerted, on, the, ice, the, precise, amount, of, pressure, may, vary, from, relatively, light, brushing, just, cleaning, to, ensure, debris, will, not, alter, the, stone, s, path, to, maximum, pressure, scrubbing, sweeping, is, allowed, anywhere, on, the, ice, up, to, the, tee, line, once, the, leading, edge, of, a, stone, crosses, the, tee, line, only, one, player, may, sweep, it, additionally, if, a, stone, is, behind, the, tee, line, one, player, from, the, opposing, team, is, allowed, to, sweep, it, this, is, the, only, case, that, a, stone, may, be, swept, by, an, opposing, team, member, in, international, rules, this, player, must, be, the, skip, but, if, the, skip, is, throwing, then, the, sweeping, player, must, be, the, third, occasionally, players, may, accidentally, touch, a, stone, with, their, broom, or, a, body, part, this, is, often, referred, to, as, burning, a, stone, players, touching, a, stone, in, such, a, manner, are, expected, to, call, their, own, infraction, as, a, matter, of, good, sportsmanship, touching, a, stationary, stone, when, no, stones, are, in, motion, there, is, no, delivery, in, progress, is, not, an, infraction, as, long, as, the, stone, is, struck, in, such, a, manner, that, its, position, is, not, altered, and, this, is, a, common, way, for, the, skip, to, indicate, a, stone, that, is, to, be, taken, out, when, a, stone, is, touched, when, stones, are, in, play, the, remedies, vary, between, leaving, the, stones, as, they, end, up, after, the, touch, replacing, the, stones, as, they, would, have, been, if, no, stone, were, touched, or, removal, of, the, touched, stone, from, play, in, non, officiated, league, play, the, skip, of, the, non, offending, team, has, the, final, say, on, where, the, stones, are, placed, after, the, infraction, many, different, types, of, shots, are, used, to, carefully, place, stones, for, strategic, or, tactical, reasons, they, fall, into, three, fundamental, categories, as, follows, guards, are, thrown, in, front, of, the, house, in, the, free, guard, zone, usually, to, protect, a, stone, or, to, make, the, opposing, team, s, shot, difficult, guard, shots, include, the, centre, guard, on, the, centreline, and, the, corner, guards, to, the, left, or, right, sides, of, the, centre, line, see, free, guard, zone, below, draws, are, thrown, only, to, reach, the, house, draw, shots, include, raise, come, around, and, freeze, shots, takeouts, are, intended, to, remove, stones, from, play, and, include, the, peel, hit, and, roll, and, double, shots, for, a, more, complete, listing, see, glossary, of, curling, terms, the, free, guard, zone, is, the, area, of, the, curling, sheet, between, the, hog, line, and, tee, line, excluding, the, house, until, five, stones, have, been, played, three, from, the, side, without, hammer, and, two, from, the, side, with, hammer, stones, in, the, free, guard, zone, may, not, be, removed, by, an, opponent, s, stone, although, they, can, be, moved, within, the, playing, area, if, a, stone, in, the, free, guard, zone, is, knocked, out, of, play, it, is, placed, back, in, the, position, it, was, in, before, the, shot, was, thrown, and, the, opponent, s, stone, is, removed, from, play, this, rule, is, known, as, the, five, rock, rule, or, the, free, guard, zone, rule, previous, versions, of, the, free, guard, zone, rule, only, limited, removing, guards, from, play, in, the, first, three, or, four, rocks, this, rule, a, relatively, recent, addition, to, curling, was, added, in, response, to, a, strategy, by, teams, of, gaining, a, lead, in, the, game, and, then, peeling, all, of, the, opponents, stones, knocking, them, out, of, play, at, an, angle, that, caused, the, shooter, s, stone, to, also, roll, out, of, play, leaving, no, stones, on, the, ice, by, knocking, all, stones, out, the, opponents, could, at, best, score, one, point, if, they, had, the, last, stone, of, the, end, called, the, hammer, if, the, team, peeling, the, rocks, had, the, hammer, they, could, peel, rock, after, rock, which, would, blank, the, end, leave, the, end, scoreless, keeping, the, last, rock, advantage, for, another, end, this, strategy, had, developed, mostly, in, canada, as, ice, makers, had, become, skilled, at, creating, a, predictable, ice, surface, and, newer, brushes, allowed, greater, control, over, the, rock, while, a, sound, strategy, this, made, for, an, unexciting, game, observers, at, the, time, noted, that, if, two, teams, equally, skilled, in, the, peel, game, faced, each, other, on, good, ice, the, outcome, of, the, game, would, be, predictable, from, who, won, the, coin, flip, to, have, last, rock, or, had, earned, it, in, the, schedule, at, the, beginning, of, the, game, the, 1990, brier, canadian, men, s, championship, was, considered, by, many, curling, fans, as, boring, to, watch, because, of, the, amount, of, peeling, and, the, quick, adoption, of, the, free, guard, zone, rule, the, following, year, reflected, how, disliked, this, aspect, of, the, game, had, become, the, free, guard, zone, rule, was, originally, called, the, modified, moncton, rule, and, was, developed, from, a, suggestion, made, by, russ, howard, for, the, moncton, 100, cashspiel, in, moncton, new, brunswick, in, january, 1990, howard, s, rule, later, known, as, the, moncton, rule, used, for, the, tournament, and, based, on, a, practice, drill, his, team, used, had, the, first, four, rocks, in, play, unable, to, be, removed, no, matter, where, they, were, at, any, time, during, the, end, this, method, of, play, was, altered, by, restricting, the, area, in, which, a, stone, was, protected, to, the, free, guard, zone, only, for, the, first, four, rocks, thrown, and, adopted, as, a, four, rock, free, guard, zone, rule, for, international, competition, shortly, after, canada, kept, to, the, traditional, rules, until, a, three, rock, free, guard, zone, rule, was, adopted, for, the, 1993, 94, season, after, several, years, of, having, the, three, rock, rule, used, for, the, canadian, championships, and, the, winners, then, having, to, adjust, to, the, four, rock, rule, in, the, world, championships, the, canadian, curling, association, adopted, the, four, rock, free, guard, zone, in, the, 2002, 03, season, one, strategy, that, has, been, developed, by, curlers, in, response, to, the, free, guard, zone, kevin, martin, from, alberta, is, one, of, the, best, examples, is, the, tick, game, where, a, shot, is, made, attempting, to, knock, tick, the, guard, to, the, side, far, enough, that, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, use, but, still, remaining, in, play, while, the, shot, itself, goes, out, of, play, the, effect, is, functionally, identical, to, peeling, the, guard, but, significantly, harder, as, a, shot, that, hits, the, guard, too, hard, knocking, it, out, of, play, results, in, its, being, replaced, while, not, hitting, it, hard, enough, can, result, in, it, still, being, tactically, useful, for, the, opposition, there, is, also, a, greater, chance, that, the, shot, will, miss, the, guard, entirely, because, of, the, greater, accuracy, required, to, make, the, shot, because, of, the, difficulty, of, making, this, type, of, shot, only, the, best, teams, will, normally, attempt, it, and, it, does, not, dominate, the, game, the, way, the, peel, formerly, did, steve, gould, from, manitoba, popularized, ticks, played, across, the, face, of, the, guard, stone, these, are, easier, to, make, because, they, impart, less, speed, on, the, object, stone, therefore, increasing, the, chance, that, it, remains, in, play, even, if, a, bigger, chunk, of, it, is, hit, with, the, tick, shot, reducing, the, effectiveness, of, the, four, rock, rule, the, grand, slam, of, curling, series, of, bonspiels, adopted, a, five, rock, rule, in, 2014, in, 2017, the, five, rock, rule, was, adopted, by, the, world, curling, federation, and, member, organizations, for, official, play, beginning, in, the, 2018, 19, season, the, last, rock, in, an, end, is, called, the, hammer, and, throwing, the, hammer, gives, a, team, a, tactical, advantage, before, the, game, teams, typically, decide, who, gets, the, hammer, in, the, first, end, either, by, chance, such, as, a, coin, toss, by, a, draw, to, the, button, contest, where, a, representative, of, each, team, shoots, to, see, who, gets, closer, to, the, centre, of, the, rings, or, particularly, in, tournament, settings, like, the, winter, olympics, by, a, comparison, of, each, team, s, win, loss, record, in, all, subsequent, ends, the, team, that, did, not, score, in, the, preceding, end, gets, to, throw, second, thus, having, the, hammer, in, the, event, that, neither, team, scores, called, a, blanked, end, the, hammer, remains, with, the, same, team, naturally, it, is, easier, to, score, points, with, the, hammer, than, without, the, team, with, the, hammer, generally, tries, to, score, two, or, more, points, if, only, one, point, is, possible, the, skip, may, try, to, avoid, scoring, at, all, in, order, to, retain, the, hammer, the, next, end, giving, the, team, another, chance, to, use, the, hammer, advantage, to, try, to, score, two, points, scoring, without, the, hammer, is, commonly, referred, to, as, stealing, or, a, steal, and, is, much, more, difficult, curling, is, a, game, of, strategy, tactics, and, skill, the, strategy, depends, on, the, team, s, skill, the, opponent, s, skill, the, conditions, of, the, ice, the, score, of, the, game, how, many, ends, remain, and, whether, the, team, has, last, stone, advantage, the, hammer, a, team, may, play, an, end, aggressively, or, defensively, aggressive, playing, will, put, a, lot, of, stones, in, play, by, throwing, mostly, draws, this, makes, for, an, exciting, game, and, although, risky, the, rewards, can, be, great, defensive, playing, will, throw, a, lot, of, hits, preventing, a, lot, of, stones, in, play, this, tends, to, be, less, exciting, and, less, risky, a, good, drawing, team, will, usually, opt, to, play, aggressively, while, a, good, hitting, team, will, opt, to, play, defensively, if, a, team, does, not, have, the, hammer, in, an, end, it, will, opt, to, try, to, clog, up, the, four, foot, zone, in, the, house, to, deny, the, opposing, team, access, to, the, button, this, can, be, done, by, throwing, centre, line, guards, in, front, of, the, house, on, the, centre, line, which, can, be, tapped, into, the, house, later, or, drawn, around, if, a, team, has, the, hammer, they, will, try, to, keep, this, four, foot, zone, free, so, that, they, have, access, to, the, button, area, at, all, times, a, team, with, the, hammer, may, throw, a, corner, guard, as, their, first, stone, of, an, end, placed, in, front, of, the, house, but, outside, the, four, foot, zone, to, utilize, the, free, guard, zone, corner, guards, are, key, for, a, team, to, score, two, points, in, an, end, because, they, can, either, draw, around, it, later, or, hit, and, roll, behind, it, making, the, opposing, team, s, shot, to, remove, it, more, difficult, ideally, the, strategy, in, an, end, for, a, team, with, the, hammer, is, to, score, two, points, or, more, scoring, one, point, is, often, a, wasted, opportunity, as, they, will, then, lose, last, stone, advantage, for, the, next, end, if, a, team, cannot, score, two, points, they, will, often, attempt, to, blank, an, end, by, removing, any, leftover, opposition, stones, and, rolling, out, or, if, there, are, no, opposition, stones, just, throwing, the, stone, through, the, house, so, that, no, team, scores, any, points, and, the, team, with, the, hammer, can, try, again, the, next, end, to, score, two, or, more, with, it, generally, a, team, without, the, hammer, would, want, to, either, force, the, team, with, the, hammer, to, only, one, point, so, that, they, can, get, the, hammer, back, or, steal, the, end, by, scoring, one, or, more, points, of, their, own, large, leads, are, often, defended, by, displacing, the, opponent, s, stones, to, reduce, their, opportunity, to, score, multiple, points, however, a, comfortably, leading, team, that, leaves, their, own, stones, in, play, becomes, vulnerable, as, the, opponent, can, draw, around, guard, stones, stones, in, the, house, can, be, tapped, back, if, they, are, in, front, of, the, tee, line, or, frozen, onto, if, they, are, behind, the, tee, line, a, frozen, stone, is, placed, in, front, of, and, touching, the, opponent, s, stone, and, is, difficult, to, remove, at, this, point, a, team, may, opt, for, peels, throws, with, a, lot, of, weight, that, can, move, opposition, stones, out, of, play, it, is, common, at, any, level, for, a, losing, team, to, terminate, the, match, before, all, ends, are, completed, if, it, believes, it, no, longer, has, a, realistic, chance, of, winning, competitive, games, end, once, the, losing, team, has, run, out, of, rocks, that, is, once, it, has, fewer, stones, in, play, and, available, for, play, than, the, number, of, points, needed, to, tie, the, game, most, decisions, about, rules, are, left, to, the, skips, although, in, official, tournaments, decisions, may, be, left, to, the, officials, however, all, scoring, disputes, are, handled, by, the, vice, skip, no, players, other, than, the, vice, skip, from, each, team, should, be, in, the, house, while, score, is, being, determined, in, tournament, play, the, most, frequent, circumstance, in, which, a, decision, has, to, be, made, by, someone, other, than, the, vice, skip, is, the, failure, of, the, vice, skips, to, agree, on, which, stone, is, closest, to, the, button, an, independent, official, supervisor, at, canadian, and, world, championships, then, measures, the, distances, using, a, specially, designed, device, that, pivots, at, the, centre, of, the, button, when, no, independent, officials, are, available, the, vice, skips, measure, the, distances, the, winner, is, the, team, having, the, highest, number, of, accumulated, points, at, the, completion, of, ten, ends, points, are, scored, at, the, conclusion, of, each, of, these, ends, as, follows, when, each, team, has, thrown, its, eight, stones, the, team, with, the, stone, closest, to, the, button, wins, that, end, the, winning, team, is, then, awarded, one, point, for, each, of, its, own, stones, lying, closer, to, the, button, than, the, opponent, s, closest, stone, only, stones, that, are, in, the, house, are, considered, in, the, scoring, a, stone, is, in, the, house, if, it, lies, within, the, 12, foot, 3, 7, m, zone, or, any, portion, of, its, edge, lies, over, the, edge, of, the, ring, since, the, bottom, of, the, stone, is, rounded, a, stone, just, barely, in, the, house, will, not, have, any, actual, contact, with, the, ring, which, will, pass, under, the, rounded, edge, of, the, stone, but, it, still, counts, this, type, of, stone, is, known, as, a, biter, it, may, not, be, obvious, to, the, eye, which, of, the, two, rocks, is, closer, to, the, button, centre, or, if, a, rock, is, actually, biting, or, not, there, are, specialized, devices, to, make, these, determinations, but, these, cannot, be, brought, out, until, after, an, end, is, completed, therefore, a, team, may, make, strategic, decisions, during, an, end, based, on, assumptions, of, rock, position, that, turn, out, to, be, incorrect, the, score, is, marked, on, a, scoreboard, of, which, there, are, two, types, the, baseball, type, and, the, club, scoreboard, the, baseball, style, scoreboard, was, created, for, televised, games, for, audiences, not, familiar, with, the, club, scoreboard, the, ends, are, marked, by, columns, 1, through, to, the, regulation, number, of, ends, for, the, competition, usually, with, an, extra, column, to, account, for, the, possibility, of, an, extra, end, to, break, ties, plus, an, additional, column, for, the, total, below, this, are, two, rows, one, for, each, team, containing, the, team, s, score, for, that, end, and, their, total, score, in, the, right, hand, column, the, club, scoreboard, is, traditional, and, used, in, most, curling, clubs, scoring, on, this, board, only, requires, the, use, of, up, to, 11, digit, cards, whereas, with, baseball, type, scoring, an, unknown, number, of, multiples, of, the, digits, especially, low, digits, like, 1, and, especially, 0, may, be, needed, the, numbered, centre, row, represents, various, possible, scores, and, the, numbers, placed, in, the, team, rows, represent, the, end, in, which, that, team, achieved, that, cumulative, score, if, the, red, team, scores, three, points, in, the, first, end, called, a, three, ender, then, a, 1, indicating, the, first, end, is, placed, beside, the, number, 3, in, the, red, row, if, they, score, two, more, in, the, second, end, then, a, 2, will, be, placed, beside, the, 5, in, the, red, row, indicating, that, the, red, team, has, five, points, in, total, 3, 2, this, scoreboard, works, because, only, one, team, can, get, points, in, an, end, however, some, confusion, may, arise, if, neither, team, scores, points, in, an, end, this, is, called, a, blank, end, the, blank, end, numbers, are, usually, listed, in, the, farthest, column, on, the, right, in, the, row, of, the, team, that, has, the, hammer, last, rock, advantage, or, on, a, special, spot, for, blank, ends, the, following, example, illustrates, the, difference, between, the, two, types, the, example, illustrates, the, men, s, final, at, the, 2006, winter, olympics, eight, points, all, the, rocks, thrown, by, one, team, counting, is, the, highest, score, possible, in, an, end, and, is, known, as, an, eight, ender, or, snowman, scoring, an, eight, ender, is, very, difficult, in, curling, it, is, the, equivalent, of, pitching, a, perfect, game, in, baseball, probably, the, best, known, snowman, came, at, the, 2006, players, championships, future, 2007, world, champion, kelly, scott, scored, eight, points, in, one, of, her, games, against, 1998, world, bronze, medalist, cathy, king, competition, teams, are, normally, named, after, the, skip, for, example, team, martin, after, skip, kevin, martin, amateur, league, players, can, and, do, creatively, name, their, teams, but, when, in, competition, a, bonspiel, the, official, team, will, have, a, standard, name, top, curling, championships, are, typically, played, by, all, male, or, all, female, teams, it, is, known, as, mixed, curling, when, a, team, consists, of, two, men, and, two, women, for, many, years, in, the, absence, of, world, championship, or, olympic, mixed, curling, events, national, championships, of,

in, ice, making, and, changes, in, the, rules, to, increase, scoring, and, promote, complex, strategy, have, increased, the, already, high, popularity, of, the, sport, in, canada, and, large,

dominated, canadian, and, international, curling, during, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, and, have, been, considered, to, be, the, best, male, curlers, of, all, time, sandra, schmirler, led, her, team, to, the, first, ever, gold, medal, in, women, s, curling, in, the, 1998, winter, olympics, when, she, died, two, years, later, from, cancer, over, 15, 000, people, attended, her, funeral, and, it, was, broadcast, on, national, television, more, so, than, in, many, other, team, sports, good, sportsmanship, often, referred, to, as, the, spirit, of, curling, is, an, integral, part, of, curling, the, spirit, of, curling, also, leads, teams, to, congratulate, their, opponents, for, making, a, good, shot, strong, sweeping, or, spectacular, form, perhaps, most, importantly, the, spirit, of, curling, dictates, that, one, never, cheers, mistakes, misses, or, gaffes, by, one, s, opponent, unlike, most, team, sports, and, one, should, not, celebrate, one, s, own, good, shots, during, the, game, beyond, modest, acknowledgement, of, the, shot, such, as, a, head, nod, fist, bump, or, thumbs, up, gesture, modest, congratulation, however, may, be, exchanged, between, winning, team, members, after, the, match, on, the, ice, celebration, is, usually, reserved, for, the, winners, of, a, major, tournament, after, winning, the, final, game, of, the, championship, it, is, completely, unacceptable, to, attempt, to, throw, opposing, players, off, their, game, by, way, of, negative, comment, distraction, or, heckling, a, match, traditionally, begins, with, players, shaking, hands, with, and, saying, good, curling, or, have, a, pleasant, game, to, each, member, of, the, opposing, team, it, is, also, traditional, in, some, areas, for, the, winning, team, to, buy, the, losing, team, a, drink, after, the, game, even, at, the, highest, levels, of, play, players, are, expected, to, call, their, own, fouls, it, is, not, uncommon, for, a, team, to, concede, a, curling, match, after, it, believes, it, no, longer, has, any, hope, of, winning, concession, is, an, honourable, act, and, does, not, carry, the, stigma, associated, with, quitting, it, also, allows, for, more, socializing, to, concede, a, match, members, of, the, losing, team, offer, congratulatory, handshakes, to, the, winning, team, thanks, wishes, of, future, good, luck, and, hugs, are, usually, exchanged, between, the, teams, to, continue, playing, when, a, team, has, no, realistic, chance, of, winning, can, be, seen, as, a, breach, of, etiquette, curling, has, been, adapted, for, wheelchair, users, and, people, otherwise, unable, to, throw, the, stone, from, the, hack, these, curlers, may, use, a, device, known, as, a, delivery, stick, the, cue, holds, on, to, the, handle, of, the, stone, and, is, then, pushed, along, by, the, curler, at, the, end, of, delivery, the, curler, pulls, back, on, the, cue, which, releases, it, from, the, stone, the, canadian, curling, association, rules, of, curling, allows, the, use, of, a, delivery, stick, in, club, play, but, does, not, permit, it, in, championships, the, delivery, stick, was, specifically, invented, for, elderly, curlers, in, canada, in, 1999, in, early, 2016, an, international, initiative, started, to, allow, use, of, the, delivery, sticks, by, players, over, 60, years, of, age, in, world, curling, federation, senior, championships, as, well, as, in, any, projected, masters, 60, championship, that, develops, in, the, future, terms, used, to, describe, the, game, include, the, ice, in, the, game, may, be, fast, keen, or, slow, if, the, ice, is, keen, a, rock, will, travel, farther, with, a, given, amount, of, weight, throwing, force, on, it, the, speed, of, the, ice, is, measured, in, seconds, one, such, measure, known, as, hog, to, hog, time, is, the, speed, of, the, stone, and, is, the, time, in, seconds, the, rock, takes, from, the, moment, it, crosses, the, near, hog, line, until, it, crosses, the, far, hog, line, if, this, number, is, lower, the, rock, is, moving, faster, so, again, low, numbers, mean, more, speed, the, ice, in, a, match, will, be, somewhat, consistent, and, thus, this, measure, of, speed, can, also, be, used, to, measure, how, far, down, the, ice, the, rock, will, travel, once, it, is, determined, that, a, rock, taking, for, example, 13, seconds, to, go, from, hog, line, to, hog, line, will, stop, on, the, tee, line, the, curler, can, know, that, if, the, hog, to, hog, time, is, matched, by, a, future, stone, that, stone, will, likely, stop, at, approximately, the, same, location, as, an, example, on, keen, ice, common, times, might, be, 16, seconds, for, guards, 14, seconds, for, draws, and, 8, seconds, for, peel, weight, the, back, line, to, hog, line, speed, is, used, principally, by, sweepers, to, get, an, initial, sense, of, the, weight, of, a, stone, as, an, example, on, keen, ice, common, times, might, be, 4, 0, seconds, for, guards, 3, 8, seconds, for, draws, 3, 2, for, normal, hit, weight, and, 2, 9, seconds, for, peel, weight, especially, at, the, club, level, this, metric, can, be, misleading, due, to, amateurs, sometimes, pushing, stones, on, release, causing, the, stone, to, travel, faster, than, the, back, to, hog, speed
