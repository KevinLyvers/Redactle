eating, also, known, as, consuming, is, the, ingestion, of, food, in, biology, this, is, typically, done, to, provide, a, heterotrophic, organism, with, energy, and, nutrients, and, to, allow, for, growth, animals, and, other, heterotrophs, must, eat, in, order, to, survive, carnivores, eat, other, animals, herbivores, eat, plants, omnivores, consume, a, mixture, of, both, plant, and, animal, matter, and, detritivores, eat, detritus, fungi, digest, organic, matter, outside, their, bodies, as, opposed, to, animals, that, digest, their, food, inside, their, bodies, for, humans, eating, is, more, complex, but, is, typically, an, activity, of, daily, living, physicians, and, dieticians, consider, a, healthful, diet, essential, for, maintaining, peak, physical, condition, some, individuals, may, limit, their, amount, of, nutritional, intake, this, may, be, a, result, of, a, lifestyle, choice, as, part, of, a, diet, or, as, religious, fasting, limited, consumption, may, be, due, to, hunger, or, famine, overconsumption, of, calories, may, lead, to, obesity, and, the, reasons, behind, it, are, myriad, however, its, prevalence, has, led, some, to, declare, an, obesity, epidemic, many, homes, have, a, large, kitchen, area, devoted, to, preparation, of, meals, and, food, and, may, have, a, dining, room, dining, hall, or, another, designated, area, for, eating, most, societies, also, have, restaurants, food, courts, and, food, vendors, so, that, people, may, eat, when, away, from, home, when, lacking, time, to, prepare, food, or, as, a, social, occasion, at, their, highest, level, of, sophistication, these, places, become, theatrical, spectacles, of, global, cosmopolitanism, and, myth, at, picnics, potlucks, and, food, festivals, eating, is, the, primary, purpose, of, a, social, gathering, at, many, social, events, food, and, beverages, are, made, available, to, attendees, people, usually, have, two, or, three, meals, a, day, snacks, of, smaller, amounts, may, be, consumed, between, meals, doctors, in, the, uk, recommend, three, meals, a, day, with, between, 400, and, 600, kcal, per, meal, with, four, to, six, hours, between, having, three, well, balanced, meals, described, as, half, of, the, plate, with, vegetables, 1, 4, protein, food, as, meat, and, 1, 4, carbohydrates, as, pasta, rice, will, then, amount, to, some, 1800, 2000, kcal, which, is, the, average, requirement, for, a, regular, person, in, jurisdictions, under, sharia, law, it, may, be, proscribed, for, muslim, adults, during, the, daylight, hours, of, ramadan, newborn, babies, do, not, eat, adult, foods, they, survive, solely, on, breast, milk, or, formula, small, amounts, of, pureed, food, are, sometimes, fed, to, young, infants, as, young, as, two, or, three, months, old, but, most, infants, do, not, eat, adult, food, until, they, are, between, six, and, eight, months, old, young, babies, eat, pureed, baby, foods, because, they, have, few, teeth, and, immature, digestive, systems, between, 8, and, 12, months, of, age, the, digestive, system, improves, and, many, babies, begin, eating, finger, foods, their, diet, is, still, limited, however, because, most, babies, lack, molars, or, canines, at, this, age, and, often, have, a, limited, number, of, incisors, by, 18, months, babies, often, have, enough, teeth, and, a, sufficiently, mature, digestive, system, to, eat, the, same, foods, as, adults, learning, to, eat, is, a, messy, process, for, children, and, children, often, do, not, master, neatness, or, eating, etiquette, until, they, are, five, or, six, years, old, eating, positions, vary, according, to, the, different, regions, of, the, world, as, culture, influences, the, way, people, eat, their, meals, for, example, most, of, the, middle, eastern, countries, eating, while, sitting, on, the, floor, is, most, common, and, it, is, believed, to, be, healthier, than, eating, while, sitting, to, a, table, eating, in, a, reclining, position, was, favored, by, the, ancient, greeks, at, a, celebration, they, called, a, symposium, and, this, custom, was, adopted, by, the, ancient, romans, ancient, hebrews, also, adopted, this, posture, for, traditional, celebrations, of, passover, compulsive, overeating, or, emotional, eating, is, the, tendency, to, eat, in, response, to, negative, emotions, empirical, studies, have, indicated, that, anxiety, leads, to, decreased, food, consumption, in, people, with, normal, weight, and, increased, food, consumption, in, the, obese, many, laboratory, studies, showed, that, overweight, individuals, are, more, emotionally, reactive, and, are, more, likely, to, overeat, when, distressed, than, people, of, normal, weight, furthermore, it, was, consistently, found, that, obese, individuals, experience, negative, emotions, more, frequently, and, more, intensively, than, do, normal, weight, persons, the, naturalistic, study, by, lowe, and, fisher, compared, the, emotional, reactivity, and, emotional, eating, of, normal, and, overweight, female, college, students, the, study, confirmed, the, tendency, of, obese, individuals, to, overeat, but, these, findings, applied, only, to, snacks, not, to, meals, that, means, that, obese, individuals, did, not, tend, to, eat, more, while, having, meals, rather, the, amount, of, snacks, they, ate, between, meals, was, greater, one, possible, explanation, that, lowe, and, fisher, suggest, is, obese, individuals, often, eat, their, meals, with, others, and, do, not, eat, more, than, average, due, to, the, reduction, of, distress, because, of, the, presence, of, other, people, another, possible, explanation, would, be, that, obese, individuals, do, not, eat, more, than, the, others, while, having, meals, due, to, social, desirability, conversely, snacks, are, usually, eaten, alone, there, are, many, physiological, mechanisms, that, control, starting, and, stopping, a, meal, the, control, of, food, intake, is, a, physiologically, complex, motivated, behavioral, system, hormones, such, as, cholecystokinin, bombesin, neurotensin, anorectin, calcitonin, enterostatin, leptin, and, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, have, all, been, shown, to, suppress, food, intake, eating, rapidly, leads, to, obesity, and, overeating, probably, because, the, feelings, of, satiety, can, be, slower, there, are, numerous, signals, given, off, that, initiate, hunger, there, are, environmental, signals, signals, from, the, gastrointestinal, system, and, metabolic, signals, that, trigger, hunger, the, environmental, signals, come, from, the, body, s, senses, the, feeling, of, hunger, could, be, triggered, by, the, smell, and, thought, of, food, the, sight, of, a, plate, or, hearing, someone, talk, about, food, the, signals, from, the, stomach, are, initiated, by, the, release, of, the, peptide, hormone, ghrelin, ghrelin, is, a, hormone, that, increases, appetite, by, signaling, to, the, brain, that, a, person, is, hungry, environmental, signals, and, ghrelin, are, not, the, only, signals, that, initiate, hunger, there, are, other, metabolic, signals, as, well, as, time, passes, between, meals, the, body, starts, to, take, nutrients, from, long, term, reservoirs, when, the, glucose, levels, of, cells, drop, glucoprivation, the, body, starts, to, produce, the, feeling, of, hunger, the, body, also, stimulates, eating, by, detecting, a, drop, in, cellular, lipid, levels, lipoprivation, both, the, brain, and, the, liver, monitor, the, levels, of, metabolic, fuels, the, brain, checks, for, glucoprivation, on, its, side, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, since, glucose, is, its, fuel, while, the, liver, monitors, the, rest, of, the, body, for, both, lipoprivation, and, glucoprivation, there, are, short, term, signals, of, satiety, that, arise, from, the, head, the, stomach, the, intestines, and, the, liver, the, long, term, signals, of, satiety, come, from, adipose, tissue, the, taste, and, odor, of, food, can, contribute, to, short, term, satiety, allowing, the, body, to, learn, when, to, stop, eating, the, stomach, contains, receptors, to, allow, us, to, know, when, we, are, full, the, intestines, also, contain, receptors, that, send, satiety, signals, to, the, brain, the, hormone, cholecystokinin, is, secreted, by, the, duodenum, and, it, controls, the, rate, at, which, the, stomach, is, emptied, this, hormone, is, thought, to, be, a, satiety, signal, to, the, brain, peptide, yy, 3, 36, is, a, hormone, released, by, the, small, intestine, and, it, is, also, used, as, a, satiety, signal, to, the, brain, insulin, also, serves, as, a, satiety, signal, to, the, brain, the, brain, detects, insulin, in, the, blood, which, indicates, that, nutrients, are, being, absorbed, by, cells, and, a, person, is, getting, full, long, term, satiety, comes, from, the, fat, stored, in, adipose, tissue, adipose, tissue, secretes, the, hormone, leptin, and, leptin, suppresses, appetite, long, term, satiety, signals, from, adipose, tissue, regulates, short, term, satiety, signals, cessation, of, eating, within, two, hours, of, sleeping, can, reduce, body, weight, the, brain, stem, can, control, food, intake, because, it, contains, neural, circuits, that, detect, hunger, and, satiety, signals, from, other, parts, of, the, body, the, brain, stem, s, involvement, of, food, intake, has, been, researched, using, rats, rats, that, have, had, the, motor, neurons, in, the, brain, stem, disconnected, from, the, neural, circuits, of, the, cerebral, hemispheres, decerebration, are, unable, to, approach, and, eat, food, instead, they, must, obtain, their, food, in, a, liquid, form, this, research, shows, that, the, brain, stem, does, in, fact, play, a, role, in, eating, there, are, two, peptides, in, the, hypothalamus, that, produce, hunger, melanin, concentrating, hormone, mch, and, orexin, mch, plays, a, bigger, role, in, producing, hunger, in, mice, mch, stimulates, feeding, and, a, mutation, causing, the, overproduction, of, mch, led, to, overeating, and, obesity, orexin, plays, a, greater, role, in, controlling, the, relationship, between, eating, and, sleeping, other, peptides, in, the, hypothalamus, that, induce, eating, are, neuropeptide, y, npy, and, agouti, related, protein, agrp, satiety, in, the, hypothalamus, is, stimulated, by, leptin, leptin, targets, the, receptors, on, the, arcuate, nucleus, and, suppresses, the, secretion, of, mch, and, orexin, the, arcuate, nucleus, also, contains, two, more, peptides, that, suppress, hunger, the, first, one, is, cocaine, and, amphetamine, regulated, transcript, cart, the, second, is, msh, melanocyte, stimulating, hormone, physiologically, eating, is, generally, triggered, by, hunger, but, there, are, numerous, physical, and, psychological, conditions, that, can, affect, appetite, and, disrupt, normal, eating, patterns, these, include, depression, food, allergies, ingestion, of, certain, chemicals, bulimia, anorexia, nervosa, pituitary, gland, malfunction, and, other, endocrine, problems, and, numerous, other, illnesses, and, eating, disorders, a, chronic, lack, of, nutritious, food, can, cause, various, illnesses, and, will, eventually, lead, to, starvation, while, changes, in, appetite, can, result, from, various, physical, and, psychological, conditions, including, depression, allergies, and, anxiety, anorexia, and, bulimia, are, specific, eating, disorders, that, profoundly, impact, the, entire, body, in, anorexia, nervosa, people, restrict, their, calorie, intake, out, of, fear, of, gaining, weight, this, malnutrition, leads, to, an, unhealthy, weight, significantly, impacting, overall, health, bulimia, is, characterized, by, recurrent, episodes, of, binge, eating, involving, the, consumption, of, a, substantial, amount, of, food, within, a, short, period, subsequently, individuals, engage, in, maladaptive, behaviors, such, as, inducing, vomiting, excessive, physical, activity, and, using, laxatives, as, compensatory, measures, if, eating, and, drinking, is, not, possible, as, is, often, the, case, when, recovering, from, surgery, alternatives, are, enteral, nutrition, and, parenteral, nutrition, to, maintain, a, high, constant, body, temperature, is, energy, expensive, mammals, therefore, need, a, nutritious, and, plentiful, diet, while, the, earliest, mammals, were, probably, predators, different, species, have, since, adapted, to, meet, their, dietary, requirements, in, a, variety, of, ways, some, eat, other, animals, this, is, a, carnivorous, diet, and, includes, insectivorous, diets, other, mammals, called, herbivores, eat, plants, which, contain, complex, carbohydrates, such, as, cellulose, an, herbivorous, diet, includes, subtypes, such, as, granivory, seed, eating, folivory, leaf, eating, frugivory, fruit, eating, nectarivory, nectar, eating, gummivory, gum, eating, and, mycophagy, fungus, eating, the, digestive, tract, of, an, herbivore, is, host, to, bacteria, that, ferment, these, complex, substances, and, make, them, available, for, digestion, which, are, either, housed, in, the, multichambered, stomach, or, in, a, large, cecum, some, mammals, are, coprophagous, consuming, feces, to, absorb, the, nutrients, not, digested, when, the, food, was, first, ingested, 131, 137, an, omnivore, eats, both, prey, and, plants, carnivorous, mammals, have, a, simple, digestive, tract, because, the, proteins, lipids, and, minerals, found, in, meat, require, little, in, the, way, of, specialized, digestion, exceptions, to, this, include, baleen, whales, who, also, house, gut, flora, in, a, multi, chambered, stomach, like, terrestrial, herbivores, the, size, of, an, animal, is, also, a, factor, in, determining, diet, type, allen, s, rule, since, small, mammals, have, a, high, ratio, of, heat, losing, surface, area, to, heat, generating, volume, they, tend, to, have, high, energy, requirements, and, a, high, metabolic, rate, mammals, that, weigh, less, than, about, 18, ounces, 510, g, 1, 1, lb, are, mostly, insectivorous, because, they, cannot, tolerate, the, slow, complex, digestive, process, of, an, herbivore, larger, animals, on, the, other, hand, generate, more, heat, and, less, of, this, heat, is, lost, they, can, therefore, tolerate, either, a, slower, collection, process, carnivores, that, feed, on, larger, vertebrates, or, a, slower, digestive, process, herbivores, furthermore, mammals, that, weigh, more, than, 18, ounces, 510, g, 1, 1, lb, usually, cannot, collect, enough, insects, during, their, waking, hours, to, sustain, themselves, the, only, large, insectivorous, mammals, are, those, that, feed, on, huge, colonies, of, insects, ants, or, termites, some, mammals, are, omnivores, and, display, varying, degrees, of, carnivory, and, herbivory, generally, leaning, in, favor, of, one, more, than, the, other, since, plants, and, meat, are, digested, differently, there, is, a, preference, for, one, over, the, other, as, in, bears, where, some, species, may, be, mostly, carnivorous, and, others, mostly, herbivorous, they, are, grouped, into, three, categories, mesocarnivory, 50, 70, meat, hypercarnivory, 70, and, greater, of, meat, and, hypocarnivory, 50, or, less, of, meat, the, dentition, of, hypocarnivores, consists, of, dull, triangular, carnassial, teeth, meant, for, grinding, food, hypercarnivores, however, have, conical, teeth, and, sharp, carnassials, meant, for, slashing, and, in, some, cases, strong, jaws, for, bone, crushing, as, in, the, case, of, hyenas, allowing, them, to, consume, bones, some, extinct, groups, notably, the, machairodontinae, had, saber, shaped, canines, some, physiological, carnivores, consume, plant, matter, and, some, physiological, herbivores, consume, meat, from, a, behavioral, aspect, this, would, make, them, omnivores, but, from, the, physiological, standpoint, this, may, be, due, to, zoopharmacognosy, physiologically, animals, must, be, able, to, obtain, both, energy, and, nutrients, from, plant, and, animal, materials, to, be, considered, omnivorous, thus, such, animals, are, still, able, to, be, classified, as, carnivores, and, herbivores, when, they, are, just, obtaining, nutrients, from, materials, originating, from, sources, that, do, not, seemingly, complement, their, classification, for, example, it, is, well, documented, that, some, ungulates, such, as, giraffes, camels, and, cattle, will, gnaw, on, bones, to, consume, particular, minerals, and, nutrients, also, cats, which, are, generally, regarded, as, obligate, carnivores, occasionally, eat, grass, to, regurgitate, indigestible, material, such, as, hairballs, aid, with, hemoglobin, production, and, as, a, laxative, birds, diets, are, varied, and, often, include, nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and, various, small, animals, including, other, birds, the, digestive, system, of, birds, is, unique, with, a, crop, for, storage, and, a, gizzard, that, contains, swallowed, stones, for, grinding, food, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, teeth, some, species, such, as, pigeons, and, some, psittacine, species, do, not, have, a, gallbladder, most, birds, are, highly, adapted, for, rapid, digestion, to, aid, with, flight, some, migratory, birds, have, adapted, to, use, protein, stored, in, many, parts, of, their, bodies, including, protein, from, the, intestines, as, additional, energy, during, migration, birds, that, employ, many, strategies, to, obtain, food, or, feed, on, a, variety, of, food, items, are, called, generalists, while, others, that, concentrate, time, and, effort, on, specific, food, items, or, have, a, single, strategy, to, obtain, food, are, considered, specialists, avian, foraging, strategies, can, vary, widely, by, species, many, birds, glean, for, insects, invertebrates, fruit, or, seeds, some, hunt, insects, by, suddenly, attacking, from, a, branch, those, species, that, seek, pest, insects, are, considered, beneficial, biological, control, agents, and, their, presence, encouraged, in, biological, pest, control, programmes, combined, insectivorous, birds, eat, 400, 500, million, metric, tons, of, arthropods, annually, nectar, feeders, such, as, hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and, lorikeets, amongst, others, have, specially, adapted, brushy, tongues, and, in, many, cases, bills, designed, to, fit, co, adapted, flowers, kiwis, and, shorebirds, with, long, bills, probe, for, invertebrates, shorebirds, varied, bill, lengths, and, feeding, methods, result, in, the, separation, of, ecological, niches, loons, diving, ducks, penguins, and, auks, pursue, their, prey, underwater, using, their, wings, or, feet, for, propulsion, while, aerial, predators, such, as, sulids, kingfishers, and, terns, plunge, dive, after, their, prey, flamingos, three, species, of, prion, and, some, ducks, are, filter, feeders, geese, and, dabbling, ducks, are, primarily, grazers
