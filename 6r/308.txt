the, tiles, must, form, words, that, in, crossword, fashion, read, left, to, right, in, rows, or, downward, in, columns, and, are, included, in, a, standard, dictionary, or, lexicon, american, architect, alfred, mosher, butts, invented, the, game, in, 1938, scrabble, is, produced, in, the, united, states, and, canada, by, hasbro, under, the, brands, of, both, of, its, subsidiaries, milton,

are, approximately, 4, 000, scrabble, clubs, around, the, world, the, game, is, played, by, two, to, four, players, on, a, square, game, board, imprinted, with, a, 15, 15, grid, of, cells, individually, known, as, squares, each, of, which, accommodates, a, single, letter, tile, in, official, club, and, tournament, games, play, is, between, two, players, or, occasionally, between, two, teams, each, of, which, collaborates, on, a, single, rack, the, board, is, marked, with, premium, squares, which, multiply, the, number, of, points, awarded, eight, dark, red, triple, word, squares, 17, pale, red, double, word, squares, of, which, one, the, center, square, h8, is, marked, with, a, star, or, other, symbol, 12, dark, blue, triple, letter, squares, and, 24, pale, blue, double, letter, squares, in, 2008, hasbro, changed, the, colors, of, the, premium, squares, to, orange, for, tw, red, for, dw, blue, for, dl, and, green, for, tl, but, the, original, premium, square, color, scheme, is, still, preferred, for, scrabble, boards, used, in, tournaments, in, an, english, language, set, the, game, contains, 100, tiles, 98, of, which, are, marked, with, a, letter, and, a, point, value, ranging, from, 1, to, 10, the, number, of, points, for, each, lettered, tile, is, based, on, the, letter, s, frequency, in, standard, english, commonly, used, letters, such, as, vowels, are, worth, one, point, while, less, common, letters, score, higher, with, q, and, z, each, worth, 10, points, the, game, also, has, two, blank, tiles, that, are, unmarked, and, carry, no, point, value, the, blank, tiles, can, be, used, as, substitutes, for, any, letter, once, laid, on, the, board, however, the, choice, is, fixed, other, language, sets, use, different, letter, set, distributions, with, different, point, values, tiles, are, usually, made, of, wood, or, plastic, and, are, 19, by, 19, millimetres, 0, 75, in, 0, 75, in, square, and, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, thick, making, them, slightly, smaller, than, the, squares, on, the, board, only, the, rosewood, tiles, of, the, deluxe, edition, vary, in, width, up, to, 2, mm, 0, 08, in, for, different, letters, travelling, versions, of, the, game, often, have, smaller, tiles, e, g, 13, mm, 13, mm, 0, 51, in, 0, 51, in, sometimes, they, are, magnetic, to, keep, them, in, place, the, capital, letter, is, printed, in, black, at, the, centre, of, the, tile, face, and, the, letter, s, point, value, is, printed, in, a, smaller, font, at, the, bottom, right, corner, most, modern, replacement, tile, sets, come, at, 18, mm, 20, mm, 0, 7, in, 0, 8, in, s, is, one, of, the, most, versatile, tiles, in, english, language, scrabble, because, it, can, be, appended, to, many, words, to, pluralize, them, or, in, the, case, of, most, verbs, convert, them, to, the, third, person, singular, present, tense, as, in, the, word, plummets, alfred, butts, included, only, four, s, tiles, to, avoid, making, the, game, too, easy, q, is, considered, the, most, troublesome, letter, as, almost, all, words, with, it, also, contain, u, a, similar, problem, occurs, in, other, languages, like, french, dutch, italian, and, german, j, is, also, difficult, to, play, due, to, its, low, frequency, and, a, scarcity, of, words, having, it, at, the, end, c, and, v, may, be, troublesome, in, the, endgame, since, no, two, letter, words, with, them, exist, except, for, ch, in, the, collins, scrabble, words, lexicon, in, 1938, the, american, architect, alfred, mosher, butts, created, the, game, as, a, variation, on, an, earlier, word, game, he, invented, called, lexiko, the, two, games, had, the, same, set, of, letter, tiles, whose, distributions, and, point, values, butts, worked, out, by, performing, a, frequency, analysis, of, letters, from, various, sources, including, the, new, york, times, the, new, game, which, he, called, criss, crosswords, added, the, 15, 15, gameboard, and, the, crossword, style, gameplay, he, manufactured, a, few, sets, himself, but, was, not, successful, in, selling, the, game, to, any, major, game, manufacturers, of, the, day, 98, in, 1948, james, brunot, a, resident, of, newtown, connecticut, and, one, of, the, few, owners, of, the, original, criss, crosswords, game, bought, the, rights, to, manufacture, the, game, in, exchange, for, granting, butts, a, royalty, on, every, unit, sold, although, he, left, most, of, the, game, including, the, distribution, of, letters, unchanged, brunot, slightly, rearranged, the, premium, squares, of, the, board, and, simplified, the, rules, he, also, renamed, the, game, scrabble, a, real, word, which, means, to, scratch, frantically, 100, in, 1949, brunot, and, his, family, made, sets, in, a, converted, former, schoolhouse, in, dodgingtown, connecticut, a, section, of, newtown, they, made, 2, 400, sets, that, year, but, lost, money, according, to, legend, scrabble, s, big, break, came, in, 1952, when, jack, straus, president, of, macy, s, played, the, game, on, vacation, upon, returning, from, vacation, he, was, surprised, to, find, that, his, store, did, not, carry, the, game, he, placed, a, large, order, and, within, a, year, everyone, had, to, have, one, 101, in, 1952, unable, to, meet, demand, himself, brunot, licensed, the, manufacturing, rights, to, long, island, based, selchow, and, righter, one, of, the, manufacturers, who, like, parker, brothers, and, milton, bradley, company, had, previously, rejected, the, game, it, s, a, nice, little, game, it, will, sell, well, in, bookstores, selchow, and, righter, president, harriet, t, righter, remembered, saying, about, scrabble, when, she, first, saw, it, in, its, second, year, as, a, selchow, and, righter, product, 1954, nearly, four, million, sets, were, sold, 104, selchow, and,

1953, were, as, follows, the, major, changes, in, 1976, were, as, follows, the, editorial, changes, made, in, 1989, did, not, affect, gameplay, the, major, changes, in, 1999, were, as, follows, before, the, game, a, word, list, or, dictionary, is, selected, in, order, to, adjudicate, any, challenges, during, the, game, in, tournament, play, the, word, list, is, specified, in, advance, typically, the, naspa, word, list, the, official, scrabble, players, dictionary, or, collins, scrabble, words, all, 100, tiles, are, placed, into, an, opaque, bag, to, decide, which, player, plays, first, each, player, draws, one, tile, from, the, bag, the, player, who, picks, the, letter, closest, to, a, goes, first, with, blanks, taking, precedence, over, the, letter, a, each, player, then, draws, seven, tiles, and, places, them, on, their, rack, hidden, from, other, players, on, every, turn, the, player, at, turn, can, perform, one, of, the, following, options, the, first, play, of, the, game, must, consist, of, at, least, two, tiles, and, cover, the, center, square, h8, any, play, thereafter, must, use, at, least, one, of, the, player, s, tiles, to, form, a, main, word, containing, all, of, the, player, s, played, tiles, in, a, straight, line, reading, left, to, right, or, top, to, bottom, diagonal, plays, are, not, allowed, at, least, one, tile, must, be, adjacent, horizontally, or, vertically, to, a, tile, already, on, the, board, if, the, play, includes, a, blank, tile, the, player, must, designate, the, letter, the, blank, represents, that, letter, remains, unchanged, for, the, rest, of, the, game, unless, the, play, is, challenged, off, the, player, announces, the, score, for, that, play, and, then, draws, tiles, from, the, bag, equal, to, the, number, of, tiles, played, so, that, there, are, 7, tiles, on, their, rack, if, there, are, not, enough, tiles, the, player, draws, any, remaining, tiles, instead, if, the, game, is, played, using, a, clock, the, player, starts, the, opponent, s, clock, after, announcing, the, score, and, before, drawing, tiles, if, a, player, has, made, a, play, and, not, yet, drawn, a, tile, any, other, player, may, choose, to, challenge, any, or, all, words, formed, by, the, play, the, challenged, word, s, are, then, searched, in, the, agreed, upon, word, list, or, dictionary, and, if, one, or, more, of, them, is, found, to, be, unacceptable, the, play, is, removed, from, the, board, and, the, player, scores, zero, for, that, turn, if, all, challenged, words, are, acceptable, the, challenger, loses, their, turn, in, tournament, play, players, are, not, entitled, to, know, which, word, s, are, invalid, or, the, definitions, of, any, challenged, words, penalties, for, unsuccessfully, challenging, an, acceptable, play, vary, in, club, and, tournament, play, and, are, described, in, greater, detail, below, the, game, ends, when, either, at, the, end, of, the, game, each, player, s, score, is, reduced, by, the, sum, of, the, values, of, their, unplayed, tiles, if, a, player, plays, out, the, sum, of, all, other, players, unplayed, tiles, is, added, to, that, player, s, score, this, rule, differs, slightly, in, most, tournaments, a, player, who, plays, out, adds, twice, this, sum, and, the, opponent, s, score, is, unchanged, the, score, for, a, play, is, determined, as, follows, scoreless, turns, can, occur, when, a, player, passes, exchanges, tiles, loses, a, challenge, or, otherwise, makes, an, illegal, move, a, scoreless, turn, can, also, occur, if, a, play, consists, of, only, blank, tiles, but, this, is, extremely, unlikely, in, actual, play, see, the, example, board, at, right, suppose, player, 1, plays, quite, 8d, with, the, q, on, a, dls, and, the, e, on, the,

several, additional, words, were, formed, each, new, word, is, scored, separately, the, score, for, this, play, without, the, 50, point, bonus, is, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 38, displaystyle, 1, 1, 4, 2, times, 0, 1, 2, times, 3, 4, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, times, 0, 1, 1, 38, points, because, all, 7, tiles, were, played, on, this, turn, a, 50, point, bonus, is, added, and, the, score, for, this, play, is, 38, 50, 88, displaystyle, 38, 50, 88, points, player, 2, plays, reco, un, ts, e4, through, the, word, un, because, this, word, covers, two, dws, squares, the, score, for, this, word, is, quadrupled, and, the, score, for, the, play, is, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 40, displaystyle, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, times, 2, times, 2, 40, points, player, 1, is,

and, plurals, words, that, contain, apostrophes, are, hyphenated, or, capitalized, such, as, proper, nouns, are, generally, not, allowed, unless, they, also, appear, as, acceptable, entries, for, example, words, such, as, heres, jack, and, texas, while, typically, containing, an, apostrophe, or, considered, a, proper, noun, have, unrelated, meanings, and, are, therefore, acceptable, in, major, scrabble, lexicons, acronyms, and, abbreviations, are, generally, not, allowed, unless, they, have, separate, entries, such, as, awol, radar, scuba, and, wysiwyg, variant, spellings, slang, or, offensive, terms, archaic, or, obsolete, terms, and, specialized, jargon, words, are, acceptable, if, they, meet, all, other, criteria, for, acceptability, but, archaic, spellings, e, g, neede, or,

words, qi, kilim, and, patisserie, vulgar, and, offensive, words, are, generally, excluded, from, the, official, scrabble, players, dictionary, but, allowed, in, club, and, tournament, play, the, north, american, scrabble, players, association, removed, slurs, from, its, lexicon, in, 2020, after, conducting, a, poll, of, its, members, mattel, removed, 400, derogatory, terms, from, its, official, word, list, in, 2021, in, response, to, the, black, lives, matter, movement, with, the, company, s, head, of, games, saying, can, you, imagine, any, other, game, where, you, can, score, points, and, win, by, using, a, racial, epithet, it, s, long, overdue, this, does, not, exclude, players, from, playing, these, words, as, it, is, within, the, rules, of, the, game, to, play, unacceptable, words, at, the, risk, of, losing, a, challenge, there, are, two, popular, competition, word, lists, for, english, language, scrabble, the, first, predominates, in, the, u, s, canada, thailand, and, the, second, in, english, scrabble, in, the, rest, of, the, world, there, is, also, a, large, community, of, competitive, collins, players, in, north, america, with, its, own, naspa,

number, of, major, college, level, dictionaries, principally, those, published, by, merriam, webster, if, a, word, appears, at, least, historically, in, any, one, of, the, dictionaries, it, is, included, in, the, nwl, and, the, ospd, if, the, word, has, only, an, offensive, meaning, it, is, included, only, in, the, nwl, the, key, difference, between, the, ospd, and, the, nwl, is, that, the, ospd, is, marketed, for, home, and, school, use, without, words, which, their, source, dictionaries, judged, offensive, rendering, the, official, scrabble, players, dictionary, less, fit, for,

unacceptable, words, are, automatically, rejected, by, the, program, the, player, is, then, required, to, make, another, play, with, no, penalty, applied, the, penalty, for, an, unsuccessful, challenge, where, all, words, challenged, in, the, play, are, deemed, valid, varies, considerably, including, under, tournament, rules, a, player, may, request, to, hold, the, opponent, s, play, to, consider, whether, to, challenge, it, provided, that, the, opponent, has, not, yet, drawn, replacement, tiles, the, holding, player, s, clock, still, runs, and, the, opponent, cannot, draw, replacement, tiles, for, 15, seconds, or, until, the, hold, is, released, but, may, draw, tiles, afterward, which, must, be, kept, separate, if, a, player, successfully, challenges, the, opponent,

scrabble, differ, somewhat, from, those, typically, found, in, casual, play, for, example, all, tournament, and, most, club, games, are, played, with, a, game, clock, and, a, set, time, control, and, are, only, between, two, players, or, occasionally, two, teams, of, players, a, player, who, goes, overtime, does, not, immediately, lose, the, game, as, in, chess, but, is, instead, assessed, a, 10, point, penalty, per, minute, also, the, original, wooden, tiles, are, not, allowed, in, tournaments, as, it, is, possible, for, players, to, feel, the, tiles, in, the, bag, especially, blank, tiles, thus, molded, plastic, tiles, are, often, used, players, are, allowed, tracking, sheets, containing, the, tile, distribution, from, which, tiles, can, be, crossed, off, as, they, are, played,

been, achieved, under, a, british, format, known, as, the, high, score, rule, in, which, a, player, s, tournament, result, is, determined, only, by, the, player, s, own, scores, and, not, by, the, differentials, between, that, player, s, scores, and, the, opponents, play, in, this, system, encourages, elaborate, setups, often, independently, mined, by, the, two, players, and, is, significantly, different, from, the, standard, game, in, which, defensive, considerations, play, a, major, role, while, the, high, score, rule, has, led, to, impressively, high, records, it, is, currently, out, of, favor, much, higher, scoring, plays, are, possible, e, g, plays, covering, three, tws, squares, but, extremely, unlikely, to, occur, without, elaborate, setups, by, both, players, the, highest,

these, official, lists, one, could, theoretically, score, 2015, ospd, and, 2044, sowpods, points, in, a, single, move, the, highest, reported, combined, score, for, a, theoretical, game, based, on,
