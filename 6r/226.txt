accurate, statistics, on, the, number, of, transgender, people, vary, widely, in, part, due, to, different, definitions, of, what, constitutes, being, transgender, some, countries, such, as, canada, collect, census, data, on, transgender, people, generally, fewer, than, 1, of, the, worldwide, population, are, transgender, with, figures, ranging, from, 0, 1, to, 0, 6, many, transgender, people, experience, gender, dysphoria, and, some, seek, medical, treatments, such, as, hormone, replacement, therapy, gender, affirming, surgery, or, psychotherapy, not, all, transgender, people, desire, these, treatments, and, some, cannot, undergo, them, for, financial, or, medical, reasons, the, legal, status, of, transgender, people, varies, by, jurisdiction, many, transgender, people, experience, transphobia, or, violence, or, discrimination, towards, transgender, people, in, the, workplace, in, accessing, public, accommodations, and, in, healthcare, in, many, places, they, are, not, legally, protected, from, discrimination, several, cultural, events, are, held, to, celebrate, the, awareness, of, transgender, people, including, transgender, day, of, remembrance, and, international, transgender, day, of, visibility, and, the, transgender, flag, is, a, common, transgender, pride, symbol, before, the, mid, 20th, century, various, terms, were, used, within, and, beyond, western, medical, and, psychological, sciences, to, identify, persons, and, identities, labeled, transsexual, and, later, transgender, from, mid, century, onward, imported, from, the, german, and, ultimately, modeled, after, german, transsexualismus, coined, in, 1923, the, english, term, transsexual, has, enjoyed, international, acceptability, though, transgender, has, been, increasingly, preferred, over, transsexual, the, word, transgender, acquired, its, modern, umbrella, term, meaning, in, the, 1990s, although, the, term, transgenderism, was, once, considered, acceptable, it, has, come, to, be, viewed, as, pejorative, according, to, glaad, psychiatrist, john, f, oliven, of, columbia, university, used, the, term, transgenderism, in, his, 1965, reference, work, sexual, hygiene, and, pathology, writing, that, the, term, which, had, previously, been, used, transsexualism, is, misleading, actually, transgenderism, is, meant, because, sexuality, is, not, a, major, factor, in, primary, transvestism, the, term, transgender, was, then, popularized, with, varying, definitions, by, transgender, transsexual, and, transvestite, people, including, christine, jorgensen, and, virginia, prince, who, used, transgenderal, in, the, december, 1969, issue, of, transvestia, a, national, magazine, for, cross, dressers, she, founded, by, the, mid, 1970s, both, trans, gender, and, trans, people, were, in, use, as, umbrella, terms, while, transgenderist, and, transgenderal, were, used, to, refer, to, people, who, wanted, to, live, their, lives, as, cross, gendered, individuals, without, gender, affirming, surgery, transgenderist, was, sometimes, abbreviated, as, tg, in, educational, and, community, resources, this, abbreviation, developed, by, the, 1980s, in, 2020, the, international, journal, of, transgenderism, changed, its, name, to, the, international, journal, of, transgender, health, to, reflect, a, change, toward, more, appropriate, and, acceptable, use, of, language, in, our, field, by, 1984, the, concept, of, a, transgender, community, had, developed, in, which, transgender, was, used, as, an, umbrella, term, in, 1985, richard, elkins, established, the, trans, gender, archive, at, the, university, of, ulster, by, 1992, the, international, conference, on, transgender, law, and, employment, policy, defined, transgender, as, an, expansive, umbrella, term, including, transsexuals, transgenderists, cross, dressers, and, anyone, transitioning, leslie, feinberg, s, pamphlet, transgender, liberation, a, movement, whose, time, has, come, circulated, in, 1992, identified, transgender, as, a, term, to, unify, all, forms, of, gender, nonconformity, in, this, way, transgender, has, become, synonymous, with, queer, in, 1994, gender, theorist, susan, stryker, defined, transgender, as, encompassing, all, identities, or, practices, that, cross, over, cut, across, move, between, or, otherwise, queer, socially, constructed, sex, gender, boundaries, including, but, not, limited, to, transsexuality, heterosexual, transvestism, gay, drag, butch, lesbianism, and, such, non, european, identities, as, the, native, american, berdache, or, the, indian, hijra, between, the, mid, 1990s, and, the, early, 2000s, the, primary, terms, used, under, the, transgender, umbrella, were, female, to, male, ftm, for, men, who, transitioned, from, female, to, male, and, male, to, female, mtf, for, women, who, transitioned, from, male, to, female, these, terms, have, been, superseded, by, trans, man, and, trans, woman, respectively, this, shift, in, preference, from, terms, highlighting, biological, sex, transsexual, ftm, to, terms, highlighting, gender, identity, and, expression, transgender, trans, man, reflects, a, broader, shift, in, the, understanding, of, transgender, people, s, sense, of, self, and, the, increasing, recognition, of, those, who, decline, medical, reassignment, as, part, of, the, transgender, community, transgender, can, also, refer, specifically, to, a, person, whose, gender, identity, is, opposite, rather, than, different, from, the, sex, the, person, had, or, was, identified, as, having, at, birth, in, contrast, people, whose, sense, of, personal, identity, corresponds, to, the, sex, and, gender, assigned, to, them, at, birth, that, is, those, who, are, neither, transgender, nor, non, binary, or, genderqueer, are, called, cisgender, transfeminine, is, a, term, for, any, person, binary, or, non, binary, who, was, assigned, male, at, birth, and, has, a, predominantly, feminine, gender, identity, or, presentation, transmasculine, refers, to, a, person, binary, or, non, binary, who, was, assigned, female, at, birth, who, has, a, predominantly, masculine, gender, identity, or, presentation, transgendered, is, a, common, term, in, older, literature, many, within, the, transgender, community, deprecate, it, on, the, basis, that, transgender, is, an, adjective, not, a, verb, organizations, such, as, glaad, and, the, guardian, also, state, that, transgender, should, never, be, used, as, a, noun, e, g, max, is, transgender, or, max, is, a, transgender, man, not, max, is, a, transgender, transgender, is, also, a, noun, for, the, broader, topic, of, transgender, identity, and, experience, health, practitioner, manuals, professional, journalistic, style, guides, and, lgbt, advocacy, groups, advise, the, adoption, by, others, of, the, name, and, pronouns, identified, by, the, person, in, question, including, present, references, to, the, transgender, person, s, past, inspired, by, magnus, hirschfeld, s, 1923, term, seelischer, transsexualismus, the, term, transsexual, was, introduced, to, english, in, 1949, by, david, oliver, cauldwell, and, popularized, by, harry, benjamin, in, 1966, around, the, same, time, transgender, was, coined, and, began, to, be, popularized, since, the, 1990s, transsexual, has, generally, been, used, to, refer, to, the, subset, of, transgender, people, who, desire, to, transition, permanently, to, the, gender, with, which, they, identify, and, who, seek, medical, assistance, for, example, sex, reassignment, surgery, with, this, distinctions, between, the, terms, transgender, and, transsexual, are, commonly, based, on, distinctions, between, gender, and, sex, transsexuality, may, be, said, to, deal, more, with, physical, aspects, of, one, s, sex, while, transgender, considerations, deal, more, with, one, s, psychological, gender, disposition, or, predisposition, as, well, as, the, related, social, expectations, that, may, accompany, a, given, gender, role, many, transgender, people, reject, the, term, transsexual, christine, jorgensen, publicly, rejected, transsexual, in, 1979, and, instead, identified, herself, in, newsprint, as, trans, gender, saying, gender, doesn, t, have, to, do, with, bed, partners, it, has, to, do, with, identity, some, have, objected, to, the, term, transsexual, on, the, basis, that, it, describes, a, condition, related, to, gender, identity, rather, than, sexuality, some, transsexual, people, object, to, being, included, in, the, transgender, umbrella, in, his, 2007, book, imagining, transgender, an, ethnography, of, a, category, anthropologist, david, valentine, asserts, that, transgender, was, coined, and, used, by, activists, to, include, many, people, who, do, not, necessarily, identify, with, the, term, and, states, that, people, who, do, not, identify, with, the, term, transgender, should, not, be, included, in, the, transgender, spectrum, leslie, feinberg, likewise, asserts, that, transgender, is, not, a, self, identifier, for, some, people, but, a, category, imposed, by, observers, to, understand, other, people, according, to, the, transgender, health, program, thp, at, fenway, health, in, boston, there, are, no, universally, accepted, definitions, and, confusion, is, common, because, terms, that, were, popular, at, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, may, have, since, been, deemed, offensive, the, thp, recommends, that, clinicians, ask, clients, what, terminology, they, prefer, and, avoid, the, term, transsexual, unless, they, are, sure, that, a, client, is, comfortable, with, it, harry, benjamin, invented, a, classification, system, for, transsexuals, and, transvestites, called, the, sex, orientation, scale, sos, in, which, he, assigned, transsexuals, and, transvestites, to, one, of, six, categories, based, on, their, reasons, for, cross, dressing, and, the, relative, urgency, of, their, need, if, any, for, sex, reassignment, surgery, contemporary, views, on, gender, identity, and, classification, differ, markedly, from, harry, benjamin, s, original, opinions, sexual, orientation, is, no, longer, regarded, as, a, criterion, for, diagnosis, or, for, distinction, between, transsexuality, transvestism, and, other, forms, of, gender, variant, behavior, and, expression, benjamin, s, scale, was, designed, for, use, with, heterosexual, trans, women, and, trans, men, s, identities, do, not, align, with, its, categories, gender, gender, identity, and, being, transgender, are, distinct, concepts, from, sexual, orientation, sexual, orientation, is, an, individual, s, enduring, pattern, of, attraction, or, lack, thereof, to, others, being, straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, etc, whereas, gender, identity, is, a, person, s, innate, knowledge, of, their, own, gender, being, a, man, woman, non, binary, etc, transgender, people, can, have, any, orientation, and, generally, use, labels, corresponding, to, their, gender, rather, than, assigned, sex, at, birth, for, example, trans, women, who, are, exclusively, attracted, to, other, women, commonly, identify, as, lesbians, and, trans, men, exclusively, attracted, to, women, would, identify, as, straight, many, trans, people, describe, their, sexual, orientation, as, queer, in, addition, to, or, instead, of, other, terms, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, transgender, identity, was, conflated, with, homosexuality, and, transvestism, in, earlier, academic, literature, sexologists, used, the, labels, homosexual, and, heterosexual, transsexual, to, categorize, transgender, individuals, sexual, orientation, based, on, their, birth, sex, critics, consider, these, terms, heterosexist, archaic, and, demeaning, newer, literature, often, uses, terms, such, as, attracted, to, men, androphilic, attracted, to, women, gynephilic, attracted, to, both, bisexual, or, attracted, to, neither, asexual, to, describe, a, person, s, sexual, orientation, without, reference, to, their, gender, identity, therapists, are, coming, to, understand, the, necessity, of, using, terms, with, respect, to, their, clients, gender, identities, and, preferences, the, 2015, u, s, transgender, survey, reported, that, of, the, 27, 715, transgender, and, non, binary, respondents, 21, said, queer, best, described, their, sexual, orientation, 18, said, pansexual, 16, said, gay, lesbian, or, same, gender, loving, 15, said, straight, 14, said, bisexual, and, 10, said, asexual, a, 2019, canadian, survey, of, 2, 873, trans, and, non, binary, people, found, that, 51, described, their, sexual, orientation, as, queer, 13, as, asexual, 28, as, bisexual, 13, as, gay, 15, as, lesbian, 31, as, pansexual, 8, as, straight, or, heterosexual, 4, as, two, spirit, and, 9, as, unsure, or, questioning, a, 2009, study, in, spain, found, that, 90, of, trans, women, patients, reported, being, androphilic, and, 94, of, trans, men, patients, reported, being, gynephilic, some, non, binary, or, genderqueer, people, identify, as, transgender, these, identities, are, not, specifically, male, or, female, they, can, be, agender, androgynous, bigender, pangender, or, genderfluid, and, exist, outside, of, cisnormativity, bigender, and, androgynous, are, overlapping, categories, bigender, individuals, may, identify, as, moving, between, male, and, female, roles, genderfluid, or, as, being, both, masculine, and, feminine, simultaneously, androgynous, and, androgynes, may, similarly, identify, as, beyond, gender, or, genderless, agender, between, genders, intergender, moving, across, genders, genderfluid, or, simultaneously, exhibiting, multiple, genders, pangender, non, binary, gender, identities, are, independent, of, sexual, orientation, a, transvestite, is, a, person, who, cross, dresses, or, dresses, in, clothes, typically, associated, with, the, gender, opposite, the, one, they, were, assigned, at, birth, the, term, transvestite, is, used, as, a, synonym, for, the, term, cross, dresser, although, cross, dresser, is, generally, considered, the, preferred, term, the, term, cross, dresser, is, not, exactly, defined, in, the, relevant, literature, michael, a, gilbert, professor, at, the, department, of, philosophy, york, university, toronto, offers, this, definition, is, a, person, who, has, an, apparent, gender, identification, with, one, sex, and, who, has, and, certainly, has, been, birth, designated, as, belonging, to, sex, but, who, wears, the, clothing, of, the, opposite, sex, because, it, is, that, of, the, opposite, sex, this, definition, excludes, people, who, wear, opposite, sex, clothing, for, other, reasons, such, as, those, female, impersonators, who, look, upon, dressing, as, solely, connected, to, their, livelihood, actors, undertaking, roles, individual, males, and, females, enjoying, a, masquerade, and, so, on, these, individuals, are, cross, dressing, but, are, not, cross, dressers, cross, dressers, may, not, identify, with, want, to, be, or, adopt, the, behaviors, or, practices, of, the, opposite, gender, and, generally, do, not, want, to, change, their, bodies, medically, or, surgically, the, majority, of, cross, dressers, identify, as, heterosexual, the, term, transvestite, and, the, associated, outdated, term, transvestism, are, conceptually, different, from, the, term, transvestic, fetishism, as, transvestic, fetishist, refers, to, those, who, intermittently, use, clothing, of, the, opposite, gender, for, fetishistic, purposes, in, medical, terms, transvestic, fetishism, is, differentiated, from, cross, dressing, by, use, of, the, separate, codes, 302, 3, in, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, and, f65, 1, in, the, icd, drag, is, clothing, and, makeup, worn, on, special, occasions, for, performing, or, entertaining, unlike, those, who, are, transgender, or, who, cross, dress, for, other, reasons, drag, performance, includes, overall, presentation, and, behavior, in, addition, to, clothing, and, makeup, drag, can, be, theatrical, comedic, or, grotesque, drag, queens, have, been, considered, caricatures, of, women, by, second, wave, feminism, drag, artists, have, a, long, tradition, in, lgbt, culture, generally, the, term, drag, queen, covers, men, doing, female, drag, drag, king, covers, women, doing, male, drag, and, faux, queen, covers, women, doing, female, drag, nevertheless, there, are, drag, artists, of, all, genders, and, sexualities, who, perform, for, various, reasons, drag, performers, are, not, inherently, transgender, some, drag, performers, transvestites, and, people, in, the, gay, community, have, embraced, the, pornographically, derived, term, tranny, for, drag, queens, or, people, who, engage, in, transvestism, or, cross, dressing, this, term, is, widely, considered, an, offensive, slur, if, applied, to, transgender, people, a, precise, history, of, the, global, occurrence, of, transgender, people, is, difficult, to, assess, because, the, modern, concept, of, being, transgender, and, of, gender, in, general, in, relation, to, transgender, identity, did, not, develop, until, the, mid, 1900s, historical, depictions, records, and, understandings, are, inherently, filtered, through, modern, principles, and, were, largely, viewed, through, a, medical, and, often, outsider, anthropological, lens, until, the, late, 1900s, some, historians, consider, the, roman, emperor, elagabalus, to, have, been, transgender, elagabalus, was, reported, to, have, dressed, in, a, feminine, manner, preferred, to, be, called, lady, instead, of, lord, and, may, have, even, sought, a, primitive, form, of, gender, affirming, surgery, worldwide, a, number, of, societies, have, had, traditional, third, gender, roles, some, of, which, continue, in, some, form, into, the, present, day, the, hippocratic, corpus, interpreting, the, writing, of, herodotus, describes, the, disease, of, the, scythians, regarding, the, enaree, which, it, attributes, to, impotency, due, to, riding, on, a, horse, without, stirrups, this, reference, was, well, discussed, by, medical, writings, of, the, 1500s, 1700s, pierre, petit, writing, in, 1596, viewed, the, scythian, disease, as, natural, variation, but, by, the, 1700s, writers, viewed, it, as, a, melancholy, or, hysterical, psychiatric, disease, by, the, early, 1800s, being, transgender, separate, from, hippocrates, idea, of, it, was, claimed, to, be, widely, known, but, remained, poorly, documented, both, trans, women, and, trans, men, were, cited, in, european, insane, asylums, of, the, early, 1800s, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, gender, nonconforming, people, in, america, was, thomas, ine, hall, a, seventeenth, century, colonial, servant, the, most, complete, account, of, the, time, came, from, the, life, of, the, chevalier, d, on, 1728, 1810, a, french, diplomat, as, cross, dressing, became, more, widespread, in, the, late, 1800s, discussion, of, transgender, people, increased, greatly, and, writers, attempted, to, explain, the, origins, of, being, transgender, much, study, came, out, of, germany, and, was, exported, to, other, western, audiences, cross, dressing, was, seen, in, a, pragmatic, light, until, the, late, 1800s, it, had, previously, served, a, satirical, or, disguising, purpose, but, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 1800s, cross, dressing, and, being, transgender, became, viewed, as, an, increasing, societal, danger, william, a, hammond, wrote, an, 1882, account, of, transgender, pueblo, shamans, mujerados, comparing, them, to, the, scythian, disease, other, writers, of, the, late, 1700s, and, 1800s, including, hammond, s, associates, in, the, american, neurological, association, had, noted, the, widespread, nature, of, transgender, cultural, practices, among, native, peoples, explanations, varied, but, authors, generally, did, not, ascribe, native, transgender, practices, to, psychiatric, causes, instead, condemning, the, practices, in, a, religious, and, moral, sense, native, groups, provided, much, study, on, the, subject, and, perhaps, the, majority, of, all, study, until, after, wwii, critical, studies, first, began, to, emerge, in, the, late, 1800s, in, germany, with, the, works, of, magnus, hirschfeld, hirschfeld, coined, the, term, transvestite, in, 1910, as, the, scope, of, transgender, study, grew, his, work, would, lead, to, the, 1919, founding, of, the, institut, f, r, sexualwissenschaft, in, berlin, though, hirscheld, s, legacy, is, disputed, he, revolutionized, the, field, of, study, the, institut, was, destroyed, when, the, nazis, seized, power, in, 1933, and, its, research, was, infamously, burned, in, the, may, 1933, nazi, book, burnings, transgender, issues, went, largely, out, of, the, public, eye, until, after, world, war, ii, even, when, they, re, emerged, they, reflected, a, forensic, psychology, approach, unlike, the, more, sexological, that, had, been, employed, in, the, lost, german, research, people, who, experience, discord, between, their, gender, and, the, expectations, of, others, or, whose, gender, identity, conflicts, with, their, body, may, benefit, by, talking, through, their, feelings, in, depth, while, individuals, may, find, counseling, or, psychotherapy, helpful, it, is, no, longer, recommended, as, a, prerequisite, for, further, transition, steps, research, on, gender, identity, with, regard, to, psychology, and, scientific, understanding, of, the, phenomenon, and, its, related, issues, is, relatively, new, the, term, gender, incongruence, is, listed, in, the, icd, by, the, who, in, the, american, dsm, the, term, gender, dysphoria, is, listed, under, code, f64, 0, for, adolescents, and, adults, and, f64, 2, for, children, further, information, causes, of, gender, incongruence, france, removed, gender, identity, disorder, as, a, diagnosis, by, decree, in, 2010, but, according, to, french, trans, rights, organizations, beyond, the, impact, of, the, announcement, itself, nothing, changed, in, 2017, the, danish, parliament, abolished, the, f64, gender, identity, disorders, the, dsm, 5, refers, to, the, topic, as, gender, dysphoria, gd, while, reinforcing, the, idea, that, being, transgender, is, not, considered, a, mental, illness, transgender, people, may, meet, the, criteria, for, a, diagnosis, of, gender, dysphoria, only, if, causes, distress, or, disability, this, distress, may, manifest, as, depression, or, inability, to, work, and, form, healthy, relationships, with, others, this, diagnosis, is, often, misinterpreted, as, implying, that, all, transgender, people, suffer, from, gd, which, has, confused, transgender, people, and, those, who, seek, to, either, criticize, or, affirm, them, transgender, people, who, are, comfortable, with, their, gender, and, whose, gender, is, not, directly, causing, inner, frustration, or, impairing, their, functioning, do, not, suffer, from, gd, moreover, gd, is, not, necessarily, permanent, and, is, often, resolved, through, therapy, or, transitioning, feeling, oppressed, by, the, negative, attitudes, and, behaviours, of, such, others, as, legal, entities, does, not, indicate, gd, gd, does, not, imply, an, opinion, of, immorality, the, psychological, establishment, holds, that, people, with, any, kind, of, mental, or, emotional, problem, should, not, receive, stigma, the, solution, for, gd, is, whatever, will, alleviate, suffering, and, restore, functionality, this, solution, often, but, not, always, consists, of, undergoing, a, gender, transition, clinical, training, lacks, relevant, information, needed, in, order, to, adequately, help, transgender, clients, which, results, in, a, large, number, of, practitioners, who, are, not, prepared, to, sufficiently, work, with, this, population, of, individuals, many, mental, healthcare, providers, know, little, about, transgender, issues, those, who, seek, help, from, these, professionals, often, educate, the, professional, without, receiving, help, this, solution, usually, is, good, for, transsexual, people, but, is, not, the, solution, for, other, transgender, people, particularly, non, binary, people, who, lack, an, exclusively, male, or, female, identity, instead, therapists, can, support, their, clients, in, whatever, steps, they, choose, to, take, to, transition, or, can, support, their, decision, not, to, transition, while, also, addressing, their, clients, sense, of, congruence, between, gender, identity, and, appearance, research, on, the, specific, problems, faced, by, the, transgender, community, in, mental, health, has, focused, on, diagnosis, and, clinicians, experiences, instead, of, transgender, clients, experiences, therapy, was, not, always, sought, by, transgender, people, due, to, mental, health, needs, prior, to, the, seventh, version, of, the, standards, of, care, soc, an, individual, had, to, be, diagnosed, with, gender, identity, disorder, in, order, to, proceed, with, hormone, treatments, or, sexual, reassignment, surgery, the, new, version, decreased, the, focus, on, diagnosis, and, instead, emphasized, the, importance, of, flexibility, in, order, to, meet, the, diverse, health, care, needs, of, transsexual, transgender, and, all, gender, nonconforming, people, the, reasons, for, seeking, mental, health, services, vary, according, to, the, individual, a, transgender, person, seeking, treatment, does, not, necessarily, mean, their, gender, identity, is, problematic, the, emotional, strain, of, dealing, with, stigma, and, experiencing, transphobia, pushes, many, transgender, people, to, seek, treatment, to, improve, their, quality, of, life, as, one, trans, woman,
