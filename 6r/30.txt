a, diaper, d, a, p, r, name, or, a, nappy, bre, aue, ire, is, a, type, of, underwear, that, allows, the, wearer, to, urinate, or, defecate, without, using, a, toilet, by, absorbing, or, containing, waste, products, to, prevent, soiling, of, outer, clothing, or, the, external, environment, when, diapers, become, wet, or, soiled, they, require, changing, generally, by, a, second, person, such, as, a, parent, or, caregiver, failure, to, change, a, diaper, on, a, sufficiently, regular, basis, can, result, in, skin, problems, around, the, area, covered, by, the, diaper, diapers, are, made, of, cloth, or, synthetic, disposable, materials, cloth, diapers, are, composed, of, layers, of, fabric, such, as, cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or, even, plastic, fibers, such, as, pla, or, pu, and, can, be, washed, and, reused, multiple, times, disposable, diapers, contain, absorbent, chemicals, and, are, thrown, away, after, use, diapers, are, primarily, worn, by, infants, toddlers, who, are, not, yet, toilet, trained, and, by, children, who, experience, bedwetting, they, are, also, used, by, adults, under, certain, circumstances, or, with, various, conditions, such, as, incontinence, adult, users, can, include, those, of, advanced, age, patients, bed, bound, in, a, hospital, individuals, with, certain, types, of, physical, or, mental, disability, and, people, working, in, extreme, conditions, such, as, astronauts, it, is, not, uncommon, for, people, to, wear, diapers, under, dry, suits, another, bear, the, ewer, the, third, a, diaper, one, of, the, earliest, known, uses, of, the, word, in, shakespeare, s, the, taming, of, the, shrew, the, middle, english, word, diaper, originally, referred, to, a, type, of, cloth, rather, than, the, use, thereof, diaper, was, the, term, for, a, pattern, of, repeated, rhombic, shapes, and, later, came, to, describe, white, cotton, or, linen, fabric, with, this, pattern, according, to, the, oxford, dictionary, it, is, a, piece, of, soft, cloth, or, other, thick, material, that, is, folded, around, a, baby, s, bottom, and, between, its, legs, to, absorb, and, hold, its, body, waste, the, first, cloth, diapers, consisted, of, a, specific, type, of, soft, tissue, sheet, cut, into, geometric, shapes, the, pattern, visible, in, linen, and, other, types, of, woven, fabric, was, called, diaper, this, meaning, of, the, word, has, been, in, use, since, the, 1590s, in, england, by, the, 19th, century, baby, diapers, were, being, sewn, from, linen, giving, us, the, modern, day, reading, of, the, word, diaper, this, usage, stuck, in, the, united, states, and, canada, following, the, british, colonization, of, north, america, but, in, the, united, kingdom, the, word, nappy, took, its, place, most, sources, believe, nappy, is, a, diminutive, form, of, the, word, napkin, which, itself, was, originally, a, diminutive, in, the, 19th, century, the, modern, diaper, began, to, take, shape, and, mothers, in, many, parts, of, the, world, used, cotton, material, held, in, place, with, a, fastening, eventually, the, safety, pin, cloth, diapers, in, the, united, states, were, first, mass, produced, in, 1887, by, maria, allen, in, the, uk, diapers, were, made, out, of, terry, towelling, often, with, an, inner, lining, made, out, of, soft, muslin, here, is, an, extract, from, the, modern, home, doctor, written, by, physicians, in, the, uk, in, 1935, nice, old, soft, bits, of, good, turkish, towelling, properly, washed, will, make, the, softest, of, diaper, coverings, inside, which, specially, absorbent, napkins, diapers, see, below, at, 1a, soft, light, and, easily, washed, are, contained, these, should, rarely, be, soiled, once, regular, habits, have, been, inculcated, especially, during, the, night, period, in, which, it, is, most, important, to, prevent, habit, formation, 1a, squares, of, butter, muslin, or, harrington, s, packed, rolls, of, mutton, cloth, in, packets, sold, for, polishing, motor, cars, would, do, equally, well, and, are, very, cheap, and, soft, wool, pants, or, once, available, rubber, pants, were, sometimes, used, over, the, cloth, diaper, to, prevent, leakage, doctors, believed, that, rubber, pants, were, harmful, because, they, thought, the, rubber, acted, as, a, poultice, and, damaged, the, skin, of, infants, the, constant, problem, to, be, overcome, was, diaper, rash, and, the, infection, thereof, the, concern, was, that, lack, of, air, circulation, would, worsen, this, condition, while, lack, of, air, circulation, is, a, factor, it, was, later, found, that, poor, hygiene, involving, inefficiently, washed, diapers, and, infrequent, changes, of, diapers, along, with, allowing, the, baby, to, lie, for, prolonged, periods, of, time, with, fecal, matter, in, contact, with, the, skin, were, the, two, main, causes, of, these, problems, in, the, 20th, century, the, disposable, diaper, was, conceived, in, the, 1930s, robinsons, of, chesterfield, had, what, were, labeled, destroyable, babies, napkins, listed, in, their, catalogue, for, the, wholesale, market, in, 1944, hugo, drangel, of, the, swedish, paper, company, paulistr, m, suggested, a, conceptual, design, which, would, entail, the, placing, of, sheets, of, paper, tissue, cellulose, wadding, inside, the, cloth, diaper, and, rubber, pants, however, cellulose, wadding, was, rough, against, the, skin, and, crumbled, into, balls, when, exposed, to, moisture, in, 1946, marion, donovan, used, a, shower, curtain, from, her, bathroom, to, create, the, boater, a, diaper, cover, made, from, army, surplus, nylon, parachute, cloth, first, sold, in, 1949, at, saks, fifth, avenue, s, flagship, store, in, new, york, city, patents, were, later, issued, in, 1951, to, donovan, who, later, sold, the, rights, to, the, waterproof, diaper, for, 1, million, donovan, also, designed, a, paper, disposable, diaper, but, was, unsuccessful, in, marketing, it, in, 1947, scottish, housewife, valerie, hunter, gordon, started, developing, and, making, paddi, a, 2, part, system, consisting, of, a, disposable, pad, made, of, cellulose, wadding, covered, with, cotton, wool, worn, inside, an, adjustable, plastic, garment, with, press, studs, snaps, initially, she, used, old, parachutes, for, the, garment, she, applied, for, the, patent, in, april, 1948, and, it, was, granted, for, the, uk, in, october, 1949, initially, the, big, manufacturers, were, unable, to, see, the, commercial, possibilities, of, disposable, diapers, in, 1948, gordon, made, over, 400, paddis, herself, using, her, sewing, machine, at, the, kitchen, table, her, husband, had, unsuccessfully, approached, several, companies, for, help, until, he, had, a, chance, meeting, with, sir, robert, robinson, at, a, business, dinner, in, november, 1949, valerie, gordon, signed, a, contract, with, robinsons, of, chesterfield, who, then, went, into, full, production, in, 1950, boots, uk, agreed, to, sell, paddi, in, all, their, branches, in, 1951, the, paddi, patent, was, granted, for, the, us, and, worldwide, shortly, after, that, playtex, and, several, other, large, international, companies, tried, unsuccessfully, to, buy, out, paddi, from, robinsons, paddi, was, very, successful, for, many, years, until, the, advent, of, all, in, one, diapers, in, sweden, hugo, drangel, s, daughter, lil, karhola, wettergren, in, 1956, elaborated, her, father, s, original, idea, by, adding, a, garment, again, making, a, 2, part, system, like, paddi, however, she, met, the, same, problem, with, the, purchasing, managers, declaring, they, would, never, allow, their, wives, to, put, paper, on, their, children, after, the, second, world, war, mothers, increasingly, wanted, freedom, from, washing, diapers, so, that, they, could, work, and, travel, causing, an, increasing, demand, for, disposable, diapers, during, the, 1950s, companies, such, as, johnson, and, johnson, kendall, parke, davis, playtex, and, molnlycke, entered, the, disposable, diaper, market, and, in, 1956, procter, gamble, began, researching, disposable, diapers, victor, mills, along, with, his, project, group, including, william, dehaas, both, men, who, worked, for, the, company, invented, what, would, be, trademarked, pampers, although, pampers, were, conceptualized, in, 1959, the, diapers, themselves, were, not, launched, into, the, market, until, 1961, pampers, now, accounts, for, more, than, 10, billion, in, annual, revenue, at, procter, gamble, as, audrey, quinn, recounts, about, the, 1980s, diaper, wars, procter, gamble, took, kimberly, clark, to, court, for, patent, infringement, one, diaper, patent, at, a, time, and, kimberly, clark, responded, in, pretty, much, the, same, way, over, the, next, few, decades, the, disposable, diaper, industry, boomed, and, the, competition, between, procter, gamble, s, pampers, and, kimberly, clark, s, huggies, resulted, in, lower, prices, and, drastic, changes, to, diaper, design, several, improvements, were, made, such, as, the, use, of, double, gussets, to, improve, diaper, fit, and, containment, as, stated, in, procter, gamble, s, initial, 1973, patent, for, the, use, of, double, gussets, in, a, diaper, the, double, gusset, folded, areas, tend, to, readily, conform, to, the, thigh, portions, of, the, leg, of, the, infant, this, allows, quick, and, easy, fitting, and, provides, a, snug, and, comfortable, diaper, fit, that, will, neither, bind, nor, wad, on, the, infant, as, a, result, of, this, snugger, fit, obtained, because, of, this, fold, configuration, the, diaper, is, less, likely, to, leak, or, in, other, words, its, containment, characteristics, are, greatly, enhanced, further, developments, in, diaper, design, were, made, such, as, the, introduction, of, refastenable, tapes, the, hourglass, shape, so, as, to, reduce, bulk, at, the, crotch, area, and, the, 1984, introduction, of, super, absorbent, material, from, polymers, known, as, sodium, polyacrylate, that, were, originally, developed, in, 1966, the, first, waterproof, diaper, cover, was, invented, in, 1946, by, marion, donovan, a, professional, turned, housewife, who, wanted, to, ensure, her, children, s, clothing, and, bedding, remained, dry, while, they, slept, she, also, invented, the, first, paper, diapers, but, executives, did, not, invest, in, this, idea, and, it, was, consequently, scrapped, for, over, ten, years, until, procter, gamble, used, donovan, s, design, ideas, to, create, pampers, another, disposable, diaper, design, was, created, by, valerie, hunter, gordon, and, patented, in, 1948, ever, since, their, introduction, product, innovations, include, the, use, of, superabsorbent, polymers, resealable, tapes, and, elasticised, waist, bands, they, are, now, much, thinner, and, much, more, absorbent, the, product, range, has, more, recently, been, extended, into, children, s, toilet, training, phase, with, the, introduction, of, training, pants, and, pant, diapers, which, are, now, undergarments, modern, disposable, baby, diapers, and, incontinence, products, have, a, layered, construction, which, allows, the, transfer, and, distribution, of, urine, to, an, absorbent, core, structure, where, it, is, locked, in, basic, layers, are, an, outer, shell, of, breathable, polyethylene, film, or, a, nonwoven, and, film, composite, which, prevents, wetness, and, soil, transfer, an, inner, absorbent, layer, of, a, mixture, of, air, laid, paper, and, superabsorbent, polymers, for, wetness, and, a, layer, nearest, the, skin, of, nonwoven, material, with, a, distribution, layer, directly, beneath, which, will, transfer, wetness, to, the, absorbent, layer, other, common, features, of, disposable, diapers, include, one, or, more, pairs, of, either, adhesive, or, mechanical, fastening, tapes, to, keep, the, diaper, securely, fastened, some, diapers, have, tapes, which, are, refastenable, to, allow, adjusting, of, fit, or, reapplication, after, inspection, elasticized, fabric, single, and, double, gussets, around, the, leg, and, waist, areas, aid, in, fitting, and, in, containing, urine, or, stool, which, has, not, been, absorbed, baby, diapers, now, have, wetness, indicators, which, consist, of, a, moisture, sensitive, ink, printed, in, the, front, of, the, diaper, as, either, a, fading, design, or, a, color, changing, line, to, alert, the, carer, or, user, that, the, diaper, is, wet, a, disposable, diaper, may, also, include, an, inner, fabric, designed, to, hold, moisture, against, the, skin, for, a, brief, period, before, absorption, to, alert, a, toilet, training, or, bedwetting, user, that, they, have, urinated, most, materials, in, the, diaper, are, held, together, with, the, use, of, a, hot, melt, adhesive, which, is, applied, in, spray, form, or, multi, lines, an, elastic, hot, melt, is, also, used, to, help, with, pad, integrity, when, the, diaper, is, wet, some, disposable, diapers, include, fragrance, lotions, or, essential, oils, in, order, to, help, mask, the, smell, of, a, soiled, diaper, or, to, protect, the, skin, care, of, disposable, diapers, is, minimal, and, primarily, consists, of, keeping, them, in, a, dry, place, before, use, with, proper, disposal, in, a, garbage, receptacle, upon, soiling, stool, is, supposed, to, be, deposited, in, the, toilet, but, is, generally, put, in, the, garbage, with, the, rest, of, the, diaper, buying, the, right, size, of, disposable, diaper, can, be, a, little, difficult, for, first, time, parents, since, different, brands, tend, to, have, different, sizing, standards, baby, diaper, sizes, in, general, are, based, on, the, child, s, weight, kg, or, lbs, and, not, determined, by, age, like, in, clothing, or, shoes, common, disposable, baby, diaper, brands, in, the, us, include, huggies, pampers, and, luvs, cloth, diapers, are, reusable, and, can, be, made, from, natural, fibers, synthetic, materials, or, a, combination, of, both, they, are, often, made, from, industrial, cotton, which, may, be, bleached, white, or, left, the, fiber, s, natural, color, other, natural, fiber, cloth, materials, include, wool, bamboo, and, unbleached, hemp, man, made, materials, such, as, an, internal, absorbent, layer, of, microfiber, toweling, or, an, external, waterproof, layer, of, polyurethane, laminate, pul, may, be, used, polyester, fleece, and, faux, suedecloth, are, often, used, inside, cloth, diapers, as, a, stay, dry, wicking, liner, because, of, the, non, absorbent, properties, of, those, synthetic, fibers, traditionally, cloth, diapers, consisted, of, a, folded, square, or, rectangle, of, cloth, fastened, with, safety, pins, today, most, cloth, diapers, are, fastened, with, hook, and, loop, tape, velcro, or, snaps, modern, cloth, diapers, come, in, a, host, of, shapes, including, preformed, cloth, diapers, all, in, one, diapers, with, waterproof, exteriors, fitted, diaper, with, covers, and, pocket, or, stuffable, diapers, which, consist, of, a, water, resistant, outer, shell, sewn, with, an, opening, for, insertion, of, absorbent, material, inserts, many, design, features, of, modern, cloth, diapers, have, followed, directly, from, innovations, initially, developed, in, disposable, diapers, such, as, the, use, of, the, hour, glass, shape, materials, to, separate, moisture, from, skin, and, the, use, of, double, gussets, or, an, inner, elastic, band, for, better, fit, and, containment, of, waste, material, several, cloth, diaper, brands, use, variations, of, procter, gamble, s, original, 1973, patent, use, of, a, double, gusset, in, pampers, compostable, diapers, can, be, made, from, a, range, of, different, plant, based, materials, dyper, makes, their, compostable, diapers, from, bamboo, fibers, babies, may, have, their, diapers, changed, five, or, more, times, a, day, parents, and, other, primary, childcare, givers, often, carry, spare, diapers, and, necessities, for, diaper, changing, in, a, specialized, diaper, bag, diapering, may, possibly, serve, as, a, good, bonding, experience, for, parent, and, child, children, who, wear, diapers, may, experience, skin, irritation, commonly, referred, to, as, diaper, rash, due, to, continual, contact, with, fecal, matter, as, feces, contains, urease, which, catalyzes, the, conversion, of, the, urea, in, urine, to, ammonia, which, can, irritate, the, skin, and, can, cause, painful, redness, the, age, at, which, children, should, cease, regularly, wearing, diapers, and, toilet, training, should, begin, is, a, subject, of, debate, proponents, of, baby, led, potty, training, and, elimination, communication, argue, that, potty, training, can, begin, at, birth, with, multiple, benefits, with, diapers, only, used, as, a, backup, keeping, children, in, diapers, beyond, infancy, can, be, controversial, with, family, psychologist, john, rosemond, claiming, it, is, a, slap, to, the, intelligence, of, a, human, being, that, one, would, allow, baby, to, continue, soiling, and, wetting, himself, past, age, two, pediatrician, t, berry, brazelton, however, believes, that, toilet, training, is, the, child, s, choice, and, has, encouraged, this, view, in, various, commercials, for, pampers, size, 6, a, diaper, for, older, children, brazelton, warns, that, enforced, toilet, training, can, cause, serious, long, term, problems, and, that, it, is, the, child, s, decision, when, to, stop, wearing, diapers, not, the, parents, children, typically, achieve, daytime, continence, and, stop, wearing, diapers, during, the, day, between, the, ages, of, two, and, four, depending, on, culture, diaper, type, parental, habits, and, the, child, s, personality, however, it, is, becoming, increasingly, common, for, children, five, to, eleven, years, old, to, still, wear, diapers, during, the, day, due, to, the, child, s, opposition, to, toilet, training, neglect, or, unconventional, parenting, techniques, other, children, may, use, diapers, past, toileting, age, due, to, disability, developmental, disorders, or, other, medical, reasons, this, can, pose, a, number, of, problems, if, the, child, is, sent, to, school, wearing, diapers, including, teasing, from, classmates, and, health, issues, resulting, from, soiled, diapers, there, has, been, recent, pushback, from, teachers, concerning, a, trend, of, more, children, in, diapers, if, a, child, soils, themselves, or, their, diaper, the, teacher, has, to, stop, the, lesson, to, focus, on, one, child, which, is, distracting, and, take, away, from, the, learning, environment, most, children, continue, to, wear, diapers, at, night, for, a, period, of, time, following, daytime, continence, older, children, may, have, problems, with, bladder, control, primarily, at, night, and, may, wear, diapers, while, sleeping, to, control, bedwetting, approximately, 16, of, children, in, the, u, s, over, the, age, of, 5, wet, the, bed, 5, of, children, over, 10, wet, the, bed, and, 2, of, children, over, 15, wet, the, bed, some, companies, have, diaper, products, specifically, designed, for, bedwetting, traditionally, hosting, higher, leak, guards, and, being, pull, on, style, similar, to, training, pants, if, bedwetting, becomes, a, concern, the, current, recommendation, is, to, consider, forgoing, the, use, of, a, diaper, at, night, as, they, may, prevent, the, child, from, wanting, to, get, out, of, bed, although, this, is, not, a, primary, cause, of, bedwetting, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, children, over, the, age, of, 8, manufacturers, have, designed, training, pants, which, bridge, the, gap, between, baby, diapers, and, normal, underwear, during, the, toilet, training, process, these, are, similar, to, infant, diapers, in, construction, but, they, can, be, pulled, on, like, normal, underwear, training, pants, are, available, for, children, who, experience, enuresis, although, most, commonly, worn, by, and, associated, with, babies, and, children, diapers, are, also, worn, by, adults, for, a, variety, of, reasons, in, the, medical, community, they, are, usually, referred, to, as, adult, absorbent, briefs, rather, than, diapers, which, are, associated, with, children, and, may, have, a, negative, connotation, the, usage, of, adult, diapers, can, be, a, source, of, embarrassment, and, products, are, often, marketed, under, euphemisms, such, as, incontinence, pads, the, most, common, adult, users, of, diapers, are, those, with, medical, conditions, which, cause, them, to, experience, urinary, incontinence, like, bedwetting, or, fecal, incontinence, those, who, are, bedridden, or, otherwise, limited, in, their, mobility, or, for, other, emotional, physical, or, mental, needs, it, is, important, that, the, user, selects, the, proper, type, size, and, absorbency, level, for, their, needs, as, every, diaper, design, is, different, scuba, divers, utilize, diapers, for, their, dry, suits, for, long, exposures, the, maximum, absorbency, garment, is, an, adult, sized, diaper, with, extra, absorption, material, that, nasa, astronauts, wear, during, liftoff, landing, and, extra, vehicular, activity, eva, the, nasa, maximum, absorbency, garment, is, however, only, designed, to, retain, 2, liters, while, the, commercial, brand, by, tykables, diapers, known, as, their, little, rawrs, diaper, line, is, iso, rated, to, retain, up, to, 7, 5, liters, of, urine, diapers, and, diaperlike, products, are, sometimes, used, on, pets, laboratory, animals, or, working, animals, this, is, often, due, to, the, animal, not, being, housebroken, or, for, older, sick, or, injured, pets, who, have, become, incontinent, in, some, cases, these, are, simply, baby, diapers, with, holes, cut, for, the, tails, to, fit, through, in, other, cases, they, are, diaperlike, waste, collection, devices, the, diapers, used, on, primates, canines, etc, are, much, like, the, diapers, used, by, humans, the, diapers, used, on, equines, are, intended, to, catch, excretions, as, opposed, to, absorbing, them, in, 2002, the, vienna, city, council, proposed, that, horses, be, made, to, wear, diapers, to, prevent, them, from, defecating, in, the, street, this, caused, controversy, amongst, animal, rights, groups, who, claimed, that, wearing, diapers, would, be, uncomfortable, for, the, animals, the, campaigners, protested, by, lining, the, streets, wearing, diapers, themselves, which, spelled, out, the, message, stop, pooh, bags, in, the, kenyan, town, of, limuru, donkeys, were, also, diapered, at, the, council, s, behest, a, similar, scheme, in, blackpool, ordered, that, horses, be, fitted, with, rubber, and, plastic, diapers, to, stop, them, littering, the, promenade, with, dung, the, council, consulted, the, rspca, to, ensure, that, the, diapers, were, not, harmful, to, the, horses, welfare, other, animals, that, are, sometimes, diapered, include, female, dogs, when, ovulating, and, thus, bleeding, and, monkeys, and, apes, or, chickens, diapers, are, often, seen, on, trained, animals, who, appear, on, tv, shows, in, movies, or, for, live, entertainment, or, educational, appearances, more, than, us, 9, billion, is, spent, on, disposable, diapers, in, north, america, each, year, as, of, 2018, name, brand, mid, range, disposable, diapers, in, the, u, s, such, as, huggies, and, pampers, were, sold, at, an, average, cost, of, approximately, 0, 20, 0, 30, each, and, their, manufacturers, earned, about, two, cents, in, profit, from, each, diaper, sold, premium, brands, had, eco, friendly, features, and, sold, for, approximately, twice, that, price, generic, disposable, diapers, cost, less, per, diaper, at, an, average, price, of, 0, 15, each, and, the, typical, manufacturer, s, profit, was, about, one, cent, per, diaper, however, the, low, cost, diapers, needed, to, be, changed, more, frequently, so, the, total, cost, savings, was, limited, as, the, lower, cost, per, diaper, was, offset, by, the, need, to, buy, more, diapers, in, latin, america, some, manufacturers, sold, disposable, diapers, at, a, price, of, approximately, us, 0, 10, each, an, average, child, will, go, through, several, thousand, diapers, in, their, life, since, disposable, diapers, are, discarded, after, a, single, use, usage, of, disposable, diapers, increases, the, burden, on, landfill, sites, and, increased, environmental, awareness, has, led, to, a, growth, in, campaigns, for, parents, to, use, reusable, alternatives, such, as, cloth, or, hybrid, diapers, an, estimated, 27, 4, billion, disposable, diapers, are, used, each, year, in, the, us, resulting, in, a, possible, 3, 4, million, tons, of, used, diapers, adding, to, landfills, each, year, a, discarded, disposable, diaper, takes, approximately, 450, years, to, decompose, the, environmental, impact, of, cloth, as, compared, to, disposable, diapers, has, been, studied, several, times, in, one, cradle, to, grave, study, sponsored, by, the, national, association, of, diaper, services, nads, and, conducted, by, carl, lehrburger, and, colleagues, results, stated, that, disposable, diapers, produce, seven, times, more, solid, waste, when, discarded, and, three, times, more, waste, in, the, manufacturing, process, in, addition, effluents, from, the, plastic, pulp, and, paper, industries, are, believed, far, more, hazardous, than, those, from, the, cotton, growing, and, manufacturing, processes, single, use, diapers, consume, less, water, than, reusables, laundered, at, home, but, more, than, those, sent, to, a, commercial, diaper, service, washing, cloth, diapers, at, home, uses, 50, to, 70, gallons, approx, 189, to, 264, litres, of, water, every, three, days, which, is, roughly, equivalent, to, flushing, the, toilet, 15, times, a, day, unless, the, user, has, a, high, efficiency, washing, machine, an, average, diaper, service, puts, its, diapers, through, an, average, of, 13, water, changes, but, uses, less, water, and, energy, per, diaper, than, one, laundry, load, at, home, in, october, 2008, an, updated, lifecycle, assessment, study, for, disposable, and, reusable, nappies, by, the, uk, environment, agency, and, department, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, stated, that, reusable, diapers, can, cause, significantly, less, up, to, 40, per, cent, or, significantly, more, damage, to, the, environment, than, disposable, ones, depending, mostly, on, how, parents, wash, and, dry, them, the, baseline, scenario, showed, that, the, difference, in, green, house, emissions, was, insignificant, in, fact, disposables, even, scored, slightly, better, however, much, better, results, emission, cuts, of, up, to, 40, per, cent, could, be, achieved, by, using, reusable, diapers, more, rationally, the, report, shows, that, in, contrast, to, the, use, of, disposable, nappies, it, is, consumers, behaviour, after, purchase, that, determines, most, of, the, impacts, from, reusable, nappies, cloth, nappy, users, can, reduce, their, environmental, impacts, by, there, are, variations, in, the, care, of, cloth, diapers, that, can, account, for, different, measures, of, environmental, impact, for, example, using, a, cloth, diaper, laundering, service, involves, additional, pollution, from, the, vehicle, that, picks, up, and, drops, off, deliveries, yet, such, a, service, uses, less, water, per, diaper, in, the, laundering, process, some, people, who, launder, cloth, diapers, at, home, wash, each, load, twice, considering, the, first, wash, a, prewash, and, thus, doubling, the, energy, and, water, usage, from, laundering, cloth, diapers, are, most, commonly, made, of, cotton, conventional, cotton, is, one, of, the, most, chemically, dependent, crops, sucking, up, 10, of, all, agricultural, chemicals, and, 25, of, insecticides, on, 3, of, our, arable, land, that, s, more, than, any, other, crop, per, unit, this, effect, can, be, mitigated, by, using, organic, cotton, or, other, materials, such, as, bamboo, and, hemp, another, aspect, to, consider, when, choosing, between, disposable, diapers, and, cloth, diapers, is, cost, it, is, estimated, that, an, average, baby, will, use, from, 1, 500, to, 2, 000, or, more, in, disposable, diapers, before, being, potty, trained, in, contrast, cloth, diapers, while, initially, more, expensive, than, disposables, if, bought, new, cost, about, 100, to, 300, for, a, basic, set, although, costs, can, rise, with, more, expensive, versions, the, cost, of, washing, and, drying, diapers, must, also, be, considered, the, basic, set, if, one, sized, can, last, from, birth, to, potty, training, another, factor, in, reusable, cloth, diaper, impact, is, the, ability, to, re, use, the, diapers, for, subsequent, children, or, sell, them, on, these, factors, can, alleviate, the, environmental, and, financial, impact, from, manufacture, sale, and, use, of, brand, new, reusable, diapers
