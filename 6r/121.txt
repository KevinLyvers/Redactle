a, cereal, is, a, grass, cultivated, for, its, edible, grain, cereals, are, the, world, s, largest, crops, and, are, therefore, staple, foods, they, include, rice, wheat, rye, oats, barley, millet, and, maize, edible, grains, from, other, plant, families, such, as, buckwheat, and, quinoa, are, pseudocereals, most, cereals, are, annuals, producing, one, crop, from, each, planting, though, rice, is, sometimes, grown, as, a, perennial, winter, varieties, are, hardy, enough, to, be, planted, in, the, autumn, becoming, dormant, in, the, winter, and, harvested, in, spring, or, early, summer, spring, varieties, are, planted, in, spring, and, harvested, in, late, summer, the, term, cereal, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, roman, goddess, of, grain, crops, and, fertility, ceres, cereals, were, domesticated, in, the, neolithic, some, 8, 000, years, ago, wheat, and, barley, were, domesticated, in, the, fertile, crescent, rice, was, domesticated, in, east, asia, and, sorghum, and, millet, were, domesticated, in, west, africa, in, the, 20th, century, cereal, productivity, was, greatly, increased, by, the, green, revolution, this, increase, in, production, has, accompanied, a, growing, international, trade, with, some, countries, producing, large, portions, of, the, cereal, supply, for, other, countries, cereals, provide, food, eaten, directly, as, whole, grains, usually, cooked, or, they, are, ground, to, flour, and, made, into, bread, porridge, and, other, products, cereals, have, a, high, starch, content, enabling, them, to, be, fermented, into, alcoholic, drinks, such, as, beer, cereal, farming, has, a, substantial, environmental, impact, and, is, often, produced, in, high, intensity, monocultures, the, environmental, harms, can, be, mitigated, by, sustainable, practices, which, reduce, the, impact, on, soil, and, improve, biodiversity, such, as, no, till, farming, and, intercropping, wheat, barley, rye, and, oats, were, gathered, and, eaten, in, the, fertile, crescent, during, the, early, neolithic, cereal, grains, 19, 000, years, old, have, been, found, at, the, ohalo, ii, site, in, israel, with, charred, remnants, of, wild, wheat, and, barley, during, the, same, period, farmers, in, china, began, to, farm, rice, and, millet, using, human, made, floods, and, fires, as, part, of, their, cultivation, regimen, the, use, of, soil, conditioners, including, manure, fish, compost, and, ashes, appears, to, have, begun, early, and, developed, independently, in, areas, of, the, world, including, mesopotamia, the, nile, valley, and, eastern, asia, cereals, that, became, modern, barley, and, wheat, were, domesticated, some, 8, 000, years, ago, in, the, fertile, crescent, millets, and, rice, were, domesticated, in, east, asia, while, sorghum, and, other, millets, were, domesticated, in, sub, saharan, west, africa, primarily, as, feed, for, livestock, in, these, agricultural, regions, religion, was, often, shaped, by, the, divinity, associated, with, the, grain, and, harvests, in, the, mesopotamian, creation, myth, an, era, of, civilization, is, inaugurated, by, the, grain, goddess, ashnan, the, roman, goddess, ceres, presided, over, agriculture, grain, crops, fertility, and, motherhood, the, term, cereal, is, derived, from, latin, cerealis, of, grain, originally, meaning, of, ceres, several, gods, of, antiquity, combined, agriculture, and, war, the, hittite, sun, goddess, of, arinna, the, canaanite, lahmu, and, the, roman, janus, complex, civilizations, arose, where, cereal, agriculture, created, a, surplus, allowing, for, part, of, the, harvest, to, be, appropriated, from, farmers, allowing, power, to, be, concentrated, in, cities, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, the, production, of, high, yield, cereal, crops, worldwide, especially, wheat, and, rice, due, to, the, green, revolution, a, technological, change, funded, by, development, organizations, the, strategies, developed, by, the, green, revolution, including, mechanized, tilling, monoculture, nitrogen, fertilizers, and, breading, of, new, strains, of, seeds, these, innovations, focused, on, fending, off, starvation, and, increasing, yield, per, plant, and, were, very, successful, in, raising, overall, yields, of, cereal, grains, but, paid, less, attention, to, nutritional, quality, these, modern, high, yield, cereal, crops, tend, to, have, low, quality, proteins, with, essential, amino, acid, deficiencies, are, high, in, carbohydrates, and, lack, balanced, essential, fatty, acids, vitamins, minerals, and, other, quality, factors, so, called, ancient, grains, and, heirloom, varieties, have, seen, an, increase, in, popularity, with, the, organic, movements, of, the, early, 21st, century, but, there, is, a, tradeoff, in, yield, per, plant, putting, pressure, on, resource, poor, areas, as, food, crops, are, replaced, with, cash, crops, cereals, are, grasses, in, the, poaceae, family, that, produce, edible, grains, a, cereal, grain, is, botanically, a, caryopsis, a, fruit, where, the, seed, coat, is, fused, with, the, pericarp, grasses, have, stems, that, are, hollow, except, at, the, nodes, and, narrow, alternate, leaves, borne, in, two, ranks, the, lower, part, of, each, leaf, encloses, the, stem, forming, a, leaf, sheath, the, leaf, grows, from, the, base, of, the, blade, an, adaptation, that, protects, the, growing, meristem, from, grazing, animals, the, flowers, are, usually, hermaphroditic, with, the, exception, of, maize, and, mainly, anemophilous, or, wind, pollinated, although, insects, occasionally, play, a, role, among, the, best, known, cereals, are, maize, rice, wheat, barley, sorghum, millet, oat, rye, and, triticale, some, other, grains, are, colloquially, called, cereals, even, though, they, are, not, grasses, these, pseudocereals, include, buckwheat, quinoa, and, amaranth, all, cereal, crops, are, cultivated, in, a, similar, way, most, are, annual, so, after, sowing, they, are, harvested, just, once, an, exception, is, rice, which, although, usually, treated, as, an, annual, can, survive, as, a, perennial, producing, a, ratoon, crop, cereals, adapted, to, a, temperate, climate, such, as, barley, oats, rye, spelt, triticale, and, wheat, are, called, cool, season, cereals, those, preferring, a, tropical, climate, such, as, millet, and, sorghum, are, called, warm, season, cereals, cool, season, cereals, especially, rye, followed, by, barley, are, hardy, they, grow, best, in, fairly, cool, weather, and, stop, growing, depending, on, variety, when, the, temperature, goes, above, around, 30, c, or, 85, f, warm, season, cereals, in, contrast, require, hot, weather, and, cannot, tolerate, frost, cool, season, cereals, can, be, grown, in, highlands, in, the, tropics, where, they, sometimes, deliver, several, crops, in, a, single, year, in, the, tropics, warm, season, cereals, can, be, grown, at, any, time, of, the, year, in, temperate, zones, these, cereals, can, only, be, grown, when, there, is, no, frost, most, cereals, are, planted, in, tilled, soils, which, reduces, weeds, and, breaks, up, the, surface, of, a, field, most, cereals, need, regular, water, in, the, early, part, of, their, life, cycle, rice, is, commonly, grown, in, flooded, fields, though, some, strains, are, grown, on, dry, land, other, warm, climate, cereals, such, as, sorghum, are, adapted, to, arid, conditions, cool, season, cereals, are, grown, mainly, in, temperate, zones, these, cereals, often, have, both, winter, varieties, for, autumn, sowing, winter, dormancy, and, early, summer, harvesting, and, spring, varieties, planted, in, spring, and, harvested, in, late, summer, winter, varieties, have, the, advantage, of, using, water, when, it, is, plentiful, and, permitting, a, second, crop, after, the, early, harvest, they, flower, only, in, spring, as, they, require, vernalization, exposure, to, cold, for, a, specific, period, fixed, genetically, spring, crops, grow, when, it, is, warmer, but, less, rainy, so, they, may, need, irrigation, cereal, strains, are, bred, for, consistency, and, resilience, to, the, local, environmental, conditions, the, greatest, constraints, on, yield, are, plant, diseases, especially, rusts, mostly, the, puccinia, spp, and, powdery, mildews, fusarium, head, blight, caused, by, fusarium, graminearum, is, a, significant, limitation, on, a, wide, variety, of, cereals, other, pressures, include, pest, insects, and, wildlife, like, rodents, and, deer, in, conventional, agriculture, some, farmers, will, apply, fungicides, or, pesticides, annual, cereals, die, when, they, have, come, to, seed, and, dry, up, harvesting, begins, once, the, plants, and, seeds, are, dry, enough, harvesting, in, mechanized, agricultural, systems, is, by, combine, harvester, a, machine, which, drives, across, the, field, in, a, single, pass, in, which, it, cuts, the, stalks, and, then, threshes, and, winnows, the, grain, in, traditional, agricultural, systems, mostly, in, the, global, south, harvesting, may, be, by, hand, using, tools, such, as, scythes, and, grain, cradles, leftover, parts, of, the, plant, can, be, allowed, to, decompose, or, collected, as, straw, this, can, be, used, for, animal, bedding, mulch, and, a, growing, medium, for, mushrooms, it, is, used, in, crafts, such, as, building, with, cob, or, straw, bale, construction, if, cereals, are, not, completely, dry, when, harvested, such, as, when, the, weather, is, rainy, the, stored, grain, will, be, spoilt, by, mould, fungi, such, as, aspergillus, and, penicillium, this, can, be, prevented, by, drying, it, artificially, it, may, then, be, stored, in, a, grain, elevator, or, silo, to, be, sold, later, grain, stores, need, to, be, constructed, to, protect, the, grain, from, damage, by, pests, such, as, seed, eating, birds, and, rodents, when, the, cereal, is, ready, to, be, distributed, it, is, sold, to, a, manufacturing, facility, that, first, removes, the, outer, layers, of, the, grain, for, subsequent, milling, for, flour, or, other, processing, steps, to, produce, foods, such, as, flour, oatmeal, or, pearl, barley, in, developing, countries, processing, may, be, traditional, in, artisanal, workshops, as, with, tortilla, production, in, central, america, most, cereals, can, be, processed, in, a, variety, of, ways, rice, processing, for, instance, can, create, whole, grain, or, polished, rice, or, rice, flour, removal, of, the, germ, increases, the, longevity, of, grain, in, storage, some, grains, can, be, malted, a, process, of, activating, enzymes, in, the, seed, to, cause, sprouting, that, turns, the, complex, starches, into, sugars, before, drying, these, sugars, can, be, extracted, for, industrial, uses, and, further, processing, such, as, for, making, industrial, alcohol, beer, whisky, or, rice, wine, or, sold, directly, as, a, sugar, in, the, 20th, century, industrial, processes, developed, around, chemically, altering, the, grain, to, be, used, for, other, processes, in, particular, maize, can, be, altered, to, produce, food, additives, such, as, corn, starch, and, high, fructose, corn, syrup, cereal, production, has, a, substantial, impact, on, the, environment, tillage, can, lead, to, soil, erosion, and, increased, runoff, irrigation, consumes, large, quantities, of, water, its, extraction, from, lakes, rivers, or, aquifers, may, have, multiple, environmental, effects, such, as, lowering, the, water, table, and, cause, salination, of, aquifers, fertilizer, production, contributes, to, global, warming, and, its, use, can, lead, to, pollution, and, eutrophication, of, waterways, arable, farming, uses, large, amounts, of, fossil, fuel, releasing, greenhouse, gases, which, contribute, to, global, warming, pesticide, usage, can, cause, harm, to, wildlife, such, as, to, bees, some, of, the, impacts, of, growing, cereals, can, be, mitigated, by, changing, production, practices, tillage, can, be, reduced, by, no, till, farming, such, as, by, direct, drilling, of, cereal, seeds, or, by, developing, and, planting, perennial, crop, varieties, so, that, annual, tilling, is, not, required, rice, can, be, grown, as, a, ratoon, crop, and, other, researchers, are, exploring, perennial, cool, season, cereals, such, as, kernza, being, developed, in, the, us, fertilizer, and, pesticide, usage, may, be, reduced, in, some, polycultures, growing, several, crops, in, a, single, field, at, the, same, time, fossil, fuel, based, nitrogen, fertilizer, usage, can, be, reduced, by, intercropping, cereals, with, legumes, which, fix, nitrogen, greenhouse, gas, emissions, may, be, cut, further, by, more, efficient, irrigation, or, by, water, harvesting, methods, like, contour, trenching, that, reduce, the, need, for, irrigation, and, by, breeding, new, crop, varieties, some, cereals, such, as, rice, require, little, preparation, before, human, consumption, for, example, to, make, plain, cooked, rice, raw, milled, rice, is, washed, and, boiled, foods, such, as, porridge, and, muesli, may, be, made, largely, of, whole, cereals, especially, oats, whereas, commercial, breakfast, cereals, such, as, granola, may, be, highly, processed, and, combined, with, sugars, oils, and, other, products, cereals, can, be, ground, to, make, flour, wheat, flour, is, the, main, ingredient, of, bread, and, pasta, maize, flour, has, been, important, in, mesoamerica, since, ancient, times, with, foods, such, as, mexican, tortillas, and, tamales, rye, flour, is, a, constituent, of, bread, in, central, and, northern, europe, while, rice, flour, is, common, in, asia, a, cereal, grain, consists, of, starchy, endosperm, germ, and, bran, wholemeal, flour, contains, all, of, these, white, flour, is, without, some, or, all, of, the, germ, or, bran, because, cereals, have, a, high, starch, content, they, are, often, used, to, make, industrial, alcohol, and, alcoholic, drinks, by, fermentation, for, instance, beer, is, produced, by, brewing, and, fermenting, starch, mainly, from, cereal, grains, most, commonly, malted, barley, rice, wines, such, as, japanese, sake, are, brewed, in, asia, a, fermented, rice, and, honey, wine, was, made, in, china, some, 9, 000, years, ago, cereals, and, their, related, byproducts, such, as, hay, are, routinely, fed, to, farm, animals, common, cereals, as, animal, food, include, maize, barley, wheat, and, oats, moist, grains, may, be, treated, chemically, or, made, into, silage, mechanically, flattened, or, crimped, and, kept, in, airtight, storage, until, used, or, stored, dry, with, a, moisture, content, of, less, than, 14, commercially, grains, are, often, combined, with, other, materials, and, formed, into, feed, pellets, as, whole, grains, cereals, provide, carbohydrates, polyunsaturated, fats, protein, vitamins, and, minerals, when, processed, by, the, removal, of, the, bran, and, germ, all, that, remains, is, the, starchy, endosperm, in, some, developing, countries, cereals, constitute, a, majority, of, daily, sustenance, in, developed, countries, cereal, consumption, is, moderate, and, varied, but, still, substantial, primarily, in, the, form, of, refined, and, processed, grains, some, cereals, are, deficient, in, the, essential, amino, acid, lysine, obliging, vegetarian, cultures, to, combine, their, diet, of, cereal, grains, with, legumes, to, obtain, a, balanced, diet, many, legumes, however, are, deficient, in, the, essential, amino, acid, methionine, which, grains, contain, thus, a, combination, of, legumes, with, grains, forms, a, well, balanced, diet, for, vegetarians, such, combinations, include, dal, lentils, with, rice, by, south, indians, and, bengalis, beans, with, maize, tortillas, tofu, with, rice, and, peanut, butter, with, wholegrain, wheat, bread, as, sandwiches, in, several, other, cultures, including, the, americas, for, feeding, animals, the, amount, of, crude, protein, measured, in, grains, is, expressed, as, grain, crude, protein, concentration, cereals, constitute, the, world, s, largest, commodities, by, tonnage, whether, measured, by, production, or, by, international, trade, several, major, producers, of, cereals, dominate, the, market, because, of, the, scale, of, the, trade, some, countries, have, become, reliant, on, imports, thus, cereals, pricing, or, availability, can, have, outsized, impacts, on, countries, with, a, food, trade, imbalance, and, thus, food, security, speculation, as, well, as, other, compounding, production, and, supply, factors, leading, up, to, the, 2007, 2008, financial, crises, created, rapid, inflation, of, grain, prices, during, the, 2007, 2008, world, food, price, crisis, other, disruptions, such, as, climate, change, or, war, related, changes, to, supply, or, transportation, can, create, further, food, insecurity, for, example, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, in, 2022, disrupted, ukrainian, and, russian, wheat, supplies, causing, a, global, food, price, crisis, in, 2022, that, affected, countries, heavily, dependent, on, wheat, flour, cereals, are, the, world, s, largest, crops, by, tonnage, of, grain, produced, three, cereals, maize, wheat, and, rice, together, accounted, for, 89, of, all, cereal, production, worldwide, in, 2012, and, 43, of, the, global, supply, of, food, energy, in, 2009, while, the, production, of, oats, and, rye, has, drastically, fallen, from, their, 1960s, levels, other, cereals, not, included, in, the, u, n, s, food, and, agriculture, organization, statistics, include, wild, rice, which, is, grown, in, small, amounts, in, north, america, and, teff, an, ancient, grain, that, is, a, staple, in, ethiopia, teff, is, grown, in, sub, saharan, africa, as, a, grass, primarily, for, feeding, horses, it, is, high, in, fiber, and, protein, its, flour, is, often, used, to, make, injera, it, can, be, eaten, as, a, warm, breakfast, cereal, like, farina, with, a, chocolate, or, nutty, flavor, the, table, shows, the, annual, production, of, cereals, in, 1961, 1980, 2000, 2010, and, 2019, 2020, millions, of, metric, tons, cereals, are, the, most, traded, commodities, by, quantity, in, 2021, with, wheat, maize, and, rice, the, main, cereals, involved, the, americas, and, europe, are, the, largest, exporters, and, asia, is, the, largest, importer, the, largest, exporter, of, maize, is, the, us, while, india, is, the, largest, exporter, of, rice, china, is, the, largest, importer, of, maize, and, of, rice, many, other, countries, trade, cereals, both, as, exporters, and, as, importers, cereals, are, traded, as, futures, on, world, commodity, markets, helping, to, mitigate, the, risks, of, changes, in, price, for, example, if, harvests, fail
