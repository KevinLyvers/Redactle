a, playground, playpark, or, play, area, is, a, place, designed, to, provide, an, environment, for, children, that, facilitates, play, typically, outdoors, while, a, playground, is, usually, designed, for, children, some, are, designed, for, other, age, groups, or, people, with, disabilities, a, playground, might, exclude, children, below, or, above, a, certain, age, modern, playgrounds, often, have, recreational, equipment, such, as, the, seesaw, merry, go, round, swingset, slide, jungle, gym, chin, up, bars, sandbox, spring, rider, trapeze, rings, playhouses, and, mazes, many, of, which, help, children, develop, physical, coordination, strength, and, flexibility, as, well, as, providing, recreation, and, enjoyment, and, supporting, social, and, emotional, development, common, in, modern, playgrounds, are, play, structures, that, link, many, different, pieces, of, equipment, playgrounds, often, also, have, facilities, for, playing, informal, games, of, adult, sports, such, as, a, baseball, diamond, a, skating, arena, a, basketball, court, or, a, tether, ball, public, playground, equipment, installed, in, the, play, areas, of, parks, schools, childcare, facilities, institutions, multiple, family, dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and, recreational, developments, and, other, areas, of, public, use, a, type, of, playground, called, a, playscape, is, designed, to, provide, a, safe, environment, for, play, in, a, natural, setting, through, history, children, played, in, their, villages, and, neighbourhoods, especially, in, the, streets, and, lanes, near, their, homes, in, the, 19th, century, developmental, psychologists, such, as, friedrich, fr, bel, proposed, playgrounds, as, a, developmental, aid, or, to, imbue, children, with, a, sense, of, fair, play, and, good, manners, in, germany, a, few, playgrounds, were, erected, in, connection, to, schools, thomas, carlyle, called, for, the, establishment, of, public, playgrounds, within, industrial, cities, such, as, manchester, england, in, past, and, present, 1843, saying, that, every, toiling, manchester, ought, to, have, a, hundred, acres, or, so, of, free, greenfield, with, trees, on, it, conquered, for, its, little, children, to, disport, in, manchester, became, the, site, of, the, first, purpose, built, public, access, playground, which, opened, in, a, park, in, 1859, however, it, was, only, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, the, street, lost, its, role, as, the, default, public, space, and, became, planned, for, use, by, motor, cars, that, momentum, built, to, remove, children, from, the, new, dangers, and, confine, them, to, segregated, areas, to, play, in, the, united, states, organisations, such, as, the, national, highway, protective, society, highlighted, the, numbers, killed, by, automobiles, and, urged, the, creation, of, playgrounds, aiming, to, free, streets, for, vehicles, rather, than, children, s, play, the, outdoor, recreation, league, provided, funds, to, erect, playgrounds, on, parkland, especially, following, the, 1901, publication, of, a, report, on, numbers, of, children, being, run, down, by, cars, in, new, york, city, in, tandem, with, the, new, concern, about, the, danger, of, roads, educational, theories, of, play, including, by, herbert, spencer, and, john, dewey, inspired, the, emergence, of, the, reformist, playground, movement, which, argued, that, playgrounds, had, educational, value, improved, attention, in, class, enhanced, physical, health, and, reduced, truancy, interventionist, programs, such, as, by, the, child, savers, sought, to, move, children, into, controlled, areas, to, limit, delinquency, meanwhile, at, schools, and, settlement, houses, for, poorer, children, with, limited, access, to, education, health, services, and, daycare, playgrounds, were, included, to, support, these, institutions, goal, of, keeping, children, safe, and, out, of, trouble, one, of, the, first, playgrounds, in, the, united, states, was, built, in, san, francisco, s, golden, gate, park, in, 1887, in, 1906, the, playground, association, of, america, was, founded, and, a, year, later, luther, gulick, became, president, it, later, became, the, national, recreation, association, and, then, the, national, recreation, and, park, association, urging, the, need, for, playgrounds, former, president, theodore, roosevelt, stated, in, 1907, in, post, war, london, the, landscape, architect, and, children, s, rights, campaigner, lady, allen, of, hurtwood, introduced, and, popularised, the, concept, of, the, junk, playground, where, the, equipment, was, constructed, from, the, recycled, junk, and, rubble, left, over, from, the, blitz, she, campaigned, for, facilities, for, children, growing, up, in, the, new, high, rise, developments, in, britain, s, cities, and, wrote, a, series, of, illustrated, books, on, the, subject, of, playgrounds, and, at, least, one, book, on, adventure, playgrounds, spaces, for, free, creativity, by, children, which, helped, the, idea, spread, worldwide, playgrounds, were, an, integral, part, of, urban, culture, in, the, ussr, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, there, were, playgrounds, in, almost, every, park, in, many, soviet, cities, playground, apparatus, was, reasonably, standard, all, over, the, country, most, of, them, consisted, of, metallic, bars, with, relatively, few, wooden, parts, and, were, manufactured, in, state, owned, factories, some, of, the, most, common, constructions, were, the, carousel, sphere, seesaw, rocket, bridge, etc, playground, design, is, influenced, by, the, intended, purpose, and, audience, separate, play, areas, might, be, offered, to, accommodate, very, young, children, single, large, open, parks, tend, to, not, to, be, used, by, older, schoolgirls, or, less, aggressive, children, because, there, is, little, opportunity, for, them, to, escape, more, aggressive, children, by, contrast, a, park, that, offers, multiple, play, areas, is, used, equally, by, boys, and, girls, professionals, recognize, that, the, social, skills, that, children, develop, on, the, playground, often, become, lifelong, skill, sets, that, are, carried, forward, into, their, adulthood, independent, research, concludes, that, playgrounds, are, among, the, most, important, environments, for, children, outside, the, home, most, forms, of, play, are, essential, for, healthy, development, but, free, spontaneous, play, the, kind, that, occurs, on, playgrounds, is, the, most, beneficial, type, of, play, exciting, engaging, and, challenging, playground, equipment, is, important, to, keep, children, happy, while, still, developing, their, learning, abilities, these, should, be, developed, in, order, to, suit, different, groups, of, children, for, different, stages, of, learning, such, as, specialist, playground, equipment, for, nursery, pre, school, children, teaching, them, basic, numeracy, vocabulary, to, building, a, child, s, creativity, and, imagination, with, role, play, panels, or, puzzles, there, is, a, general, consensus, that, physical, activity, reduces, the, risk, of, psychological, problems, in, children, and, fosters, their, self, esteem, the, american, chief, medical, officer, s, report, department, of, health, 2004, stated, that, a, review, of, available, research, suggests, that, the, health, benefits, of, physical, activity, in, children, are, predominantly, seen, in, the, amelioration, of, risk, factors, for, disease, avoidance, of, weight, gain, achieving, a, peak, bone, mass, and, mental, well, being, exercise, programmes, may, have, short, term, beneficial, effects, on, self, esteem, in, children, and, adolescents, although, high, quality, trials, are, lacking, commentators, argue, that, the, quality, of, a, child, s, exercise, experience, can, affect, their, self, esteem, ajzen, tpb, 1991, promotes, the, notion, that, children, s, self, esteem, is, enhanced, through, the, encouragement, of, physical, mastery, and, self, development, it, can, be, seen, that, playgrounds, provide, an, ideal, opportunity, for, children, to, master, physical, skills, such, as, learning, to, swing, balance, and, climb, personal, development, may, be, gained, through, the, enhancement, of, skills, such, as, playing, communicating, and, cooperating, with, other, children, and, adults, in, the, playground, it, can, also, be, seen, that, public, and, private, playgrounds, act, as, a, preventative, health, measure, amongst, young, people, because, they, promote, physical, activity, at, a, stage, in, children, s, lives, when, they, are, active, and, not, yet, at, risk, from, opting, out, of, physical, activity, children, have, devised, many, playground, games, and, pastimes, but, because, playgrounds, are, usually, subject, to, adult, supervision, and, oversight, young, children, s, street, culture, often, struggles, to, fully, thrive, there, research, by, robin, moore, concluded, shown, that, playgrounds, need, to, be, balanced, with, marginal, areas, that, to, adults, appear, to, be, derelict, or, wasteground, but, to, children, they, are, areas, that, they, can, claim, for, themselves, ideally, a, wooded, area, or, field, for, many, children, it, is, their, favorite, time, of, day, when, they, get, to, be, on, the, playground, for, free, time, or, recess, it, acts, as, a, release, for, them, from, the, pressures, of, learning, during, the, day, they, know, that, time, on, the, playground, is, their, own, time, a, type, of, playground, called, a, playscape, can, provide, children, with, the, necessary, feeling, of, ownership, that, moore, describes, above, playscapes, can, also, provide, parents, with, the, assurance, of, their, child, s, safety, and, wellbeing, which, may, not, be, prevalent, in, an, open, field, or, wooded, area, in, the, uk, several, organisations, exist, that, help, provide, funding, for, schools, and, local, authorities, to, construct, playgrounds, these, include, the, biffa, award, which, provides, funding, under, the, small, grants, scheme, funding, central, which, offers, support, for, voluntary, organisations, and, social, enterprises, and, the, community, construction, fund, a, flagship, programme, by, norfolk, county, council, safety, in, the, context, of, playgrounds, is, generally, understood, as, the, prevention, of, injuries, risk, aversion, and, fear, of, lawsuits, on, the, part, of, the, adults, who, design, playgrounds, prioritizes, injury, prevention, above, other, factors, such, as, cost, or, developmental, benefit, to, the, users, it, is, important, that, children, gradually, develop, the, skill, of, risk, assessment, and, a, completely, safe, environment, does, not, allow, that, sometimes, the, safety, of, playgrounds, is, disputed, in, school, or, among, regulators, over, at, least, the, last, twenty, years, the, kinds, of, equipment, to, be, found, in, playgrounds, has, changed, often, towards, safer, equipment, built, with, plastic, for, example, an, older, jungle, gym, might, be, constructed, entirely, from, steel, bars, while, newer, ones, tend, to, have, a, minimal, steel, framework, while, providing, a, web, of, nylon, ropes, for, children, to, climb, on, playgrounds, with, equipment, that, children, may, fall, off, often, use, rubber, mulch, on, the, ground, to, help, cushion, the, impact, playgrounds, are, also, made, differently, for, different, age, groups, often, schools, have, a, playground, that, is, taller, and, more, advanced, for, older, schoolchildren, and, a, lower, playground, with, less, risk, of, falling, for, younger, children, safety, discussions, do, not, normally, include, an, evaluation, of, the, unintended, consequences, of, injury, prevention, such, as, older, children, who, do, not, exercise, at, the, playground, because, the, playground, is, too, boring, safety, efforts, sometimes, paradoxically, increase, the, likelihood, and, severity, of, injuries, because, of, how, people, choose, to, use, playground, equipment, for, example, older, children, may, choose, to, climb, on, the, outside, of, a, safe, but, boring, play, structure, rather, than, using, it, the, way, the, designers, intended, similarly, rather, than, letting, young, children, play, on, playground, slides, by, themselves, some, injury, averse, parents, seat, the, children, on, the, adult, s, lap, and, go, down, the, slide, together, this, seems, safer, at, first, glance, but, if, the, child, s, shoe, catches, on, the, edge, of, the, slide, this, arrangement, frequently, results, in, the, child, s, leg, being, broken, if, the, child, had, been, permitted, to, use, the, slide, independently, then, this, injury, would, not, happen, because, when, the, shoe, caught, the, child, would, have, stopped, sliding, rather, than, being, propelled, down, the, slide, by, the, adult, s, weight, also, concerning, the, safety, of, playgrounds, is, the, material, in, which, they, are, built, wooden, playgrounds, act, as, a, more, natural, environment, for, the, children, to, play, but, can, cause, even, more, minor, injuries, slivers, are, the, main, concern, when, building, with, wood, material, wet, weather, is, also, a, threat, to, children, playing, on, wooden, structures, most, woods, are, treated, and, do, not, wear, terribly, fast, but, with, enough, rain, wooden, playgrounds, can, become, slippery, and, dangerous, for, children, to, be, on, in, the, united, states, the, consumer, product, safety, commission, and, the, american, national, standards, institute, have, created, a, standardized, document, and, training, system, for, certification, of, playground, safety, inspectors, these, regulations, are, nationwide, and, provide, a, basis, for, safe, playground, installation, and, maintenance, practices, astm, f1487, 07, deals, with, specific, requirements, regarding, issues, such, as, play, ground, layout, use, zones, and, various, test, criteria, for, determining, play, ground, safety, astm, f2373, covers, public, use, play, equipment, for, children, 6, 24, months, old, this, information, can, be, applied, effectively, only, by, a, trained, c, p, s, i, a, national, listing, of, trained, playground, safety, inspectors, is, available, for, many, states, a, certified, playground, safety, inspector, cpsi, is, a, career, that, was, developed, by, the, national, playground, safety, institute, npsi, and, is, recognized, nationally, by, the,

1176, because, the, majority, of, playground, injuries, are, due, to, falls, from, equipment, injury, prevention, efforts, are, primarily, directed, at, reducing, the, likelihood, of, a, child, falling, and, reducing, the, likelihood, of, a, severe, injury, if, the, child, does, fall, this, is, done, by, how, effective, these, strategies, are, at, preventing, injuries, is, debated, by, experts, because, when, playgrounds, are, made, from, padded, materials, children, often, take, more, risks, each, year, in, the, united, states, emergency, departments, treat, more, than, 200, 000, children, ages, 14, and, younger, for, playground, related, injuries, approximately, 156, 040, 75, 8, of, the, 1999, injuries, occurred, on, equipment, designed, for, public, use, 46, 930, 22, 8, occurred, on, equipment, designed, for, home, use, and, 2, 880, 1, 4, occurred, on, homemade, playground, equipment, primarily, rope, swings, from, january, 1990, to, august, 2000, cpsc, received, reports, of, 147, deaths, to, children, younger, than, 15, that, involved, playground, equipment, girls, were, involved, in, a, slightly, higher, percentage, of, injuries, 55, than, were, boys, 45, injuries, to, the, head, and, face, accounted, for, 49, of, injuries, to, children, 0, 4, while, injuries, to, the, arm, and, hand, accounted, for, 49, of, injuries, to, children, ages, 5, 14, approximately, 15, of, the, injuries, were, classified, as, severe, with, 3, requiring, hospitalization, the, most, prevalent, diagnoses, were, fractures, 39, lacerations, 22, contusions, abrasions, 20, strains, sprains, 11, for, children, ages, 0, 4, climbers, 40, had, the, highest, incidence, rates, followed, by, slides, 33, for, children, ages, 5, 14, climbing, equipment, 56, had, the, highest, incidence, rates, followed, by, swings, 24, most, injuries, on, public, playground, equipment, were, associated, with, climbing, equipment, 53, swings, 19, and, slides, 17, falls, to, the, surface, was, a, contributing, factor, in, 79, of, all, injuries, on, home, equipment, 81, were, associated, with, falls, in, 1995, playground, related, injuries, among, children, ages, 14, and, younger, cost, an, estimated, 1, 2, billion, on, public, playgrounds, more, injuries, occur, on, climbers, than, on, any, other, equipment, on, home, playgrounds, swings, are, responsible, for, most, injuries, playgrounds, in, low, income, areas, have, more, maintenance, related, hazards, than, playgrounds, in, high, income, areas, for, example, playgrounds, in, low, income, areas, had, significantly, more, trash, rusty, play, equipment, and, damaged, fall, surfaces, as, a, result, of, what, some, experts, say, is, overprotectiveness, driven, by, a, fear, of, lawsuits, playgrounds, have, been, designed, to, be, or, at, least, to, appear, excessively, safe, this, overprotectiveness, may, protect, the, playground, owner, from, lawsuits, but, it, appears, to, result, in, a, decreased, sense, of, achievement, and, increased, fears, in, children, the, equipment, limitations, result, in, the, children, receiving, less, value, from, the, play, time, the, enclosed, padded, constrained, low, structures, prevent, the, child, from, taking, risks, and, developing, a, sense, of, mastery, over, his, or, her, environment, successfully, taking, a, risk, is, empowering, to, children, for, example, a, child, climbing, to, the, top, of, a, tall, jungle, gym, feels, happy, about, successfully, managing, the, challenging, climb, to, the, top, and, he, experiences, the, thrill, of, being, in, a, precarious, high, position, by, contrast, the, child, on, a, low, piece, of, equipment, designed, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, injuries, from, falls, experiences, no, such, thrill, sense, of, mastery, or, accomplishment, additionally, a, lack, of, experience, with, heights, as, a, child, is, associated, with, increased, acrophobia, fear, of, heights, in, adults, the, appearance, of, safety, encourages, unreasonable, risk, taking, in, children, who, might, take, more, reasonable, risks, if, they, correctly, understood, that, it, is, possible, to, break, a, bone, on, the, soft, surfaces, under, most, modern, equipment, finally, the, playground, that, is, designed, to, appear, low, risk, is, boring, especially, to, older, children, as, a, result, they, tend, to, seek, out, alternative, play, areas, which, may, be, very, unsafe, risk, management, is, an, important, life, skill, and, risk, aversion, in, playgrounds, is, unhelpful, in, the, long, term, experts, studying, child, development, such, as, tim, gill, have, written, about, the, over, protective, bias, in, provision, for, children, particularly, with, playgrounds, instead, of, a, constructed, playground, allowing, children, to, play, in, a, natural, environment, such, as, open, land, or, a, park, is, sometimes, recommended, children, gain, a, better, sense, of, balance, playing, on, uneven, ground, and, learn, to, interpret, the, complexity, and, signals, of, nature, more, effectively, playgrounds, can, be, universally, designed, playgrounds, are, created, to, be, accessible, to, all, children, there, are, three, primary, components, to, a, higher, level, of, inclusive, play, some, children, with, disabilities, or, developmental, differences, do, not, interact, with, playgrounds, in, the, same, way, as, typical, children, a, playground, designed, without, considering, these, children, s, needs, may, not, be, accessible, or, interesting, to, them, most, efforts, at, inclusive, playgrounds, have, been, aimed, at, accommodating, wheelchair, users, for, example, rubber, paths, and, ramps, replace, sand, pits, and, steps, and, some, features, are, placed, at, ground, level, efforts, to, accommodate, children, on, the, autism, spectrum, who, may, find, playgrounds, overstimulating, or, who, may, have, difficulty, interacting, with, other, children, have, been, less, common, natural, playgrounds, are, play, environments, that, blend, natural, materials, features, and, indigenous, vegetation, with, creative, landforms, to, create, purposely, complex, interplays, of, natural, environmental, objects, in, ways, that, challenge, and, fascinate, children, and, teach, them, about, the, wonders, and, intricacies, of, the, natural, world, while, they, play, within, it, play, components, may, include, earth, shapes, sculptures, environmental, art, indigenous, vegetation, trees, shrubs, grasses, flowers, lichens, mosses, boulders, or, other, rock, structures, dirt, and, sand, natural, fences, stone, willow, wooden, textured, pathways, and, natural, water, features, some, playgrounds, have, specific, purposes, a, traffic, park, teaches, children, how, to, navigate, streets, safely, an, adventure, playground, encourages, open, ended, play, sometimes, involving, potentially, dangerous, objects, such, as, fire, or, hand, tools, an, obstacle, course, or, ropes, course, is, designed, to, focus, participants, attention, on, accomplishing, a, pre, determined, challenging, physical, task, a, trampoline, park, provides, trampolines, china, and, some, countries, in, europe, have, playgrounds, designed, for, adults, these, are, outdoor, spaces, that, feature, fitness, equipment, designed, for, use, primarily, by, adults, such, as, chin, up, bars, playgrounds, for, older, adults, are, popular, in, china, seniors, are, the, primary, users, of, public, playgrounds, in, china, these, playgrounds, are, usually, in, a, smaller, screened, area, which, may, reduce, the, feeling, of, being, watched, or, judged, by, others, they, often, have, adult, sized, equipment, that, helps, seniors, stretch, strengthen, muscles, and, improve, their, sense, of, balance, similar, playgrounds, for, adults, have, been, built, in, other, countries, berlin, s, preu, enpark, for, example, is, designed, for, people, aged,
