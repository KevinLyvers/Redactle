the, 100, metres, or, 100, meter, dash, is, a, sprint, race, in, track, and, field, competitions, the, shortest, common, outdoor, running, distance, the, 100, meter, 109, 36, yd, dash, is, one, of, the, most, popular, and, prestigious, events, in, the, sport, of, athletics, it, has, been, contested, at, the, summer, olympics, since, 1896, for, men, and, since, 1928, for, women, the, inaugural, world, championships, were, in, 1983, on, an, outdoor, 400, metre, running, track, the, 100, m, is, held, on, the, home, straight, with, the, start, usually, being, set, on, an, extension, to, make, it, a, straight, line, race, there, are, three, instructions, given, to, the, runners, immediately, before, and, at, the, beginning, of, the, race, on, your, marks, set, and, the, firing, of, the, starter, s, pistol, the, runners, move, to, the, starting, blocks, when, they, hear, the, on, your, marks, instruction, the, following, instruction, to, adopt, the, set, position, allows, them, to, adopt, a, more, efficient, starting, posture, and, isometrically, preload, their, muscles, this, will, help, them, to, start, faster, a, race, official, then, fires, the, starter, s, pistol, to, signal, the, race, beginning, and, the, sprinters, stride, forwards, from, the, blocks, sprinters, typically, reach, top, speed, after, somewhere, between, 50, and, 60, m, their, speed, then, slows, towards, the, finish, line, the, 10, second, barrier, has, historically, been, a, barometer, of, fast, men, s, performances, while, the, best, female, sprinters, take, eleven, seconds, or, less, to, complete, the, race, the, men, s, world, record, is, 9, 58, seconds, set, by, jamaica, s, usain, bolt, in, 2009, while, the, women, s, world, record, is, 10, 49, seconds, set, by, american, florence, griffith, joyner, in, 1988, the, unofficial, world, s, fastest, man, title, typically, goes, to, the, olympic, 100, metre, champion, the, 200, metre, time, almost, always, yields, a, faster, average, speed, than, a, 100, metre, race, time, since, the, initial, slow, speed, at, the, start, is, spread, out, over, the, longer, distance, the, current, men, s, olympic, and, world, champion, is, noah, lyles, while, the, current, women, s, olympic, champion, is, julien, alfred, and, the, world, champion, is, sha, carri, richardson, at, the, start, some, athletes, play, psychological, games, such, as, trying, to, be, last, to, the, starting, blocks, at, high, level, meets, the, time, between, the, gun, and, first, kick, against, the, starting, block, is, measured, electronically, via, sensors, built, in, the, gun, and, the, blocks, a, reaction, time, less, than, 0, 100, s, is, considered, a, false, start, this, time, interval, accounts, for, the, sum, of, the, time, it, takes, for, the, sound, of, the, starter, s, pistol, to, reach, the, runners, ears, and, the, time, they, take, to, react, to, it, for, many, years, a, sprinter, was, disqualified, if, responsible, for, two, false, starts, individually, however, this, rule, allowed, some, major, races, to, be, restarted, so, many, times, that, the, sprinters, started, to, lose, focus, the, next, iteration, of, the, rule, introduced, in, february, 2003, meant, that, one, false, start, was, allowed, among, the, field, but, anyone, responsible, for, a, subsequent, false, start, was, disqualified, this, rule, led, to, some, sprinters, deliberately, false, starting, to, gain, a, psychological, advantage, an, individual, with, a, slower, reaction, time, might, false, start, forcing, the, faster, starters, to, wait, and, be, sure, of, hearing, the, gun, for, the, subsequent, start, thereby, losing, some, of, their, advantage, to, avoid, such, abuse, and, to, improve, spectator, enjoyment, the, iaaf, implemented, a, further, change, in, the, 2010, season, a, false, starting, athlete, now, receives, immediate, disqualification, this, proposal, was, met, with, objections, when, first, raised, in, 2005, on, the, grounds, that, it, would, not, leave, any, room, for, innocent, mistakes, justin, gatlin, commented, just, a, flinch, or, a, leg, cramp, could, cost, you, a, year, s, worth, of, work, the, rule, had, a, dramatic, impact, at, the, 2011, world, championships, when, current, world, record, holder, usain, bolt, was, disqualified, runners, usually, reach, their, top, speed, just, past, the, halfway, point, of, the, race, and, progressively, decelerate, to, the, finish, maintaining, that, top, speed, for, as, long, as, possible, is, a, primary, focus, of, training, for, the, 100, m, pacing, and, running, tactics, do, not, play, a, significant, role, in, the, 100, m, as, success, in, the, event, depends, more, on, pure, athletic, qualities, and, technique, the, winner, by, iaaf, competition, rules, is, determined, by, the, first, athlete, with, their, torso, not, including, limbs, head, or, neck, over, the, nearer, edge, of, the, finish, line, there, is, therefore, no, requirement, for, the, entire, body, to, cross, the, finish, line, when, the, placing, of, the, athletes, is, not, obvious, a, photo, finish, is, used, to, distinguish, which, runner, was, first, to, cross, the, line, climatic, conditions, in, particular, air, resistance, can, affect, performances, in, the, 100, m, a, strong, head, wind, is, very, detrimental, to, performance, while, a, tail, wind, can, improve, performances, significantly, for, this, reason, a, maximum, tail, wind, of, 2, 0, metres, per, second, 4, 5, mph, is, allowed, for, a, 100, m, performance, to, be, considered, eligible, for, records, or, wind, legal, furthermore, sprint, athletes, perform, a, better, run, at, high, altitudes, because, of, the, thinner, air, which, provides, less, air, resistance, in, theory, the, thinner, air, would, also, make, breathing, slightly, more, difficult, due, to, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, being, lower, but, this, difference, is, negligible, for, sprint, distances, where, all, the, oxygen, needed, for, the, short, dash, is, already, in, the, muscles, and, bloodstream, when, the, race, starts, while, there, are, no, limitations, on, altitude, performances, made, at, altitudes, greater, than, 1000, m, above, sea, level, are, marked, with, an, a, the, 10, second, mark, had, been, widely, considered, a, barrier, for, the, 100, metres, in, men, s, sprinting, the, first, man, to, break, the, 10, second, barrier, with, automatic, timing, was, jim, hines, at, the, 1968, summer, olympics, since, then, over, 190, sprinters, have, run, faster, than, 10, seconds, similarly, 11, seconds, is, considered, the, standard, for, female, athletes, the, first, woman, to, go, under, 11, seconds, was, marlies, g, hr, in, 1977, major, 100, m, races, such, as, at, the, olympic, games, attract, much, attention, particularly, when, the, world, record, is, thought, to, be, within, reach, the, men, s, world, record, has, been, improved, upon, twelve, times, since, electronic, timing, became, mandatory, in, 1977, the, current, men, s, world, record, of, 9, 58, s, is, held, by, usain, bolt, of, jamaica, set, at, the, 2009, world, athletics, championships, final, in, berlin, germany, on, 16, august, 2009, breaking, his, own, previous, world, record, by, 0, 11, s, the, current, women, s, world, record, of, 10, 49, s, was, set, by, florence, griffith, joyner, of, the, us, at, the, 1988, united, states, olympic, trials, in, indianapolis, indiana, on, 16, july, 1988, breaking, evelyn, ashford, s, four, year, old, world, record, by, 0, 27, seconds, the, extraordinary, nature, of, this, result, and, those, of, several, other, sprinters, in, this, race, raised, the, possibility, of, a, technical, malfunction, with, the, wind, gauge, which, read, at, 0, 0, m, s, a, reading, which, was, at, complete, odds, to, the, windy, conditions, on, the, day, with, high, wind, speeds, being, recorded, in, all, other, sprints, before, and, after, this, race, as, well, as, the, parallel, long, jump, runway, at, the, time, of, the, griffith, joyner, performance, the, next, best, wind, legal, performance, is, elaine, thompson, herah, s, 10, 54, second, clocking, in, 2021, at, the, prefontaine, classic, griffith, joyner, s, next, best, legal, performance, of, 10, 61, from, 1988, would, have, her, third, on, the, all, time, list, behind, thompson, herah, and, shelly, ann, fraser, pryce, 10, 60, some, records, have, been, marred, by, prohibited, drug, use, in, particular, the, scandal, at, the, 1988, summer, olympics, when, the, winner, canadian, ben, johnson, was, stripped, of, his, medal, and, world, record, jim, hines, ronnie, ray, smith, and, charles, greene, were, the, first, to, break, the, 10, second, barrier, in, the, 100, m, all, on, 20, june, 1968, the, night, of, speed, hines, also, recorded, the, first, legal, electronically, timed, sub, 10, second, 100, m, in, winning, the, 100, metres, at, the, 1968, olympics, bob, hayes, ran, a, wind,
