rum, is, a, liquor, made, by, fermenting, and, then, distilling, sugarcane, molasses, or, sugarcane, juice, the, distillate, a, clear, liquid, is, often, aged, in, barrels, of, oak, rum, originated, in, the, caribbean, in, the, 17th, century, but, today, it, is, produced, in, nearly, every, major, sugar, producing, region, of, the, world, such, as, the, philippines, where, tanduay, distillers, the, largest, producer, of, rum, worldwide, has, its, headquarters, rums, are, produced, in, various, grades, light, rums, are, commonly, used, in, cocktails, whereas, golden, and, dark, rums, were, typically, consumed, straight, or, neat, iced, on, the, rocks, or, used, for, cooking, but, are, now, commonly, consumed, with, mixers, premium, rums, are, made, to, be, consumed, either, straight, or, iced, rum, plays, a, part, in, the, culture, of, most, islands, of, the, west, indies, as, well, as, the, maritime, provinces, and, newfoundland, in, canada, it, has, associations, with, the, royal, navy, where, it, was, mixed, with, water, or, beer, to, make, grog, and, piracy, where, it, was, consumed, as, bumbo, rum, has, served, as, a, medium, of, economic, exchange, used, to, help, fund, enterprises, such, as, slavery, via, triangular, trade, organized, crime, and, military, insurgencies, such, as, the, american, revolution, and, the, australian, rum, rebellion, the, origin, of, the, word, rum, is, unclear, the, most, widely, accepted, hypothesis, is, that, it, is, related, to, rumbullion, a, beverage, made, from, boiling, sugar, cane, stalks, or, possibly, rumbustion, which, was, a, slang, word, for, uproar, or, tumult, a, noisy, uncontrollable, exuberance, though, the, origin, of, those, words, and, the, nature, of, the, relationship, are, unclear, both, words, surfaced, in, english, about, the, same, time, as, rum, did, 1651, for, rumbullion, and, before, 1654, rum, there, have, been, various, other, theories, regardless, of, the, original, source, the, name, was, already, in, common, use, by, 1654, when, the, general, court, of, connecticut, ordered, the, confiscations, of, whatsoever, barbados, liquors, commonly, called, rum, kill, the, devil, and, the, like, a, short, time, later, in, may, 1657, the, general, court, of, massachusetts, also, decided, to, make, illegal, the, sale, of, strong, liquor, whether, knowne, by, the, name, of, rumme, strong, water, wine, brandy, etc, in, current, usage, the, name, used, for, a, rum, is, often, based, on, its, place, of, origin, for, rums, from, places, mostly, in, latin, america, where, spanish, is, spoken, the, word, ron, is, used, a, ron, a, ejo, aged, rum, is, a, premium, spirit, rhum, is, the, term, that, typically, distinguishes, rum, made, from, fresh, sugar, cane, juice, from, rum, made, from, molasses, in, french, speaking, locales, like, martinique, a, rhum, vieux, old, rum, is, an, aged, french, rum, that, meets, several, other, requirements, some, of, the, many, other, names, for, rum, are, nelson, s, blood, kill, devil, demon, water, pirate, s, drink, navy, neater, and, barbados, water, a, version, of, rum, from, newfoundland, is, referred, to, by, the, name, screech, while, some, low, grade, west, indies, rums, are, called, tafia, many, historians, now, believe, that, rum, making, found, its, way, to, the, caribbean, islands, along, with, sugarcane, and, its, cultivation, methods, from, brazil, the, traditional, history, of, modern, style, rum, tells, of, its, invention, in, the, caribbean, in, the, 17th, century, by, slaves, on, sugarcane, plantations, who, discovered, that, molasses, a, by, product, of, the, sugar, refining, process, could, be, fermented, into, alcohol, and, then, distilled, the, earliest, record, in, a, 1651, document, from, barbados, mentions, the, island, of, nevis, in, particular, the, chief, fuddling, they, make, in, the, island, is, rumbullion, alias, kill, divil, and, this, is, made, of, sugar, canes, distilled, a, hot, hellish, and, terrible, liquor, by, the, late, 17th, century, rum, had, replaced, french, brandy, as, the, exchange, alcohol, of, choice, in, the, triangle, trade, canoemen, and, guards, on, the, african, side, of, the, trade, who, had, previously, been, paid, in, brandy, were, now, paid, in, rum, after, the, development, of, rum, in, the, caribbean, the, drink, s, popularity, spread, to, colonial, north, america, to, support, the, demand, for, the, drink, the, first, rum, distillery, in, the, thirteen, colonies, was, set, up, in, 1664, on, staten, island, boston, massachusetts, had, a, distillery, three, years, later, the, manufacture, of, rum, became, early, colonial, new, england, s, largest, and, most, prosperous, industry, new, england, became, a, distilling, center, due, to, the, technical, metalworking, and, cooperage, skills, and, abundant, lumber, the, rum, produced, there, was, lighter, more, like, whiskey, much, of, the, rum, was, exported, and, distillers, in, newport, of, rhode, island, even, made, an, extra, strong, rum, specifically, to, be, used, as, a, slave, currency, rhode, island, rum, even, joined, gold, as, an, accepted, currency, in, europe, for, a, period, of, time, while, new, england, triumphed, in, price, and, consistency, europeans, still, viewed, the, best, rums, as, coming, from, the, caribbean, estimates, of, rum, consumption, in, the, american, colonies, before, the, american, revolutionary, war, had, every, man, woman, or, child, drinking, an, average, of, 3, imperial, gallons, 14, l, of, rum, each, year, in, the, 18th, century, ever, increasing, demands, for, sugar, molasses, rum, and, slaves, led, to, a, feedback, loop, that, intensified, the, triangular, trade, when, france, banned, the, production, of, rum, in, their, new, world, possessions, to, end, the, domestic, competition, with, brandy, new, england, distillers, were, then, able, to, undercut, producers, in, the, british, west, indies, by, buying, cut, rate, molasses, from, french, sugar, plantations, the, outcry, from, the, british, rum, industry, led, to, the, molasses, act, of, 1733, which, levied, a, prohibitive, tax, on, molasses, imported, into, the, thirteen, colonies, from, foreign, countries, or, colonies, rum, at, this, time, accounted, for, approximately, 80, of, new, england, s, exports, and, paying, the, duty, would, have, put, the, distilleries, out, of, business, as, a, result, both, compliance, with, and, enforcement, of, the, act, were, minimal, strict, enforcement, of, the, molasses, act, s, successor, the, sugar, act, in, 1764, may, have, helped, cause, the, american, revolution, in, the, slave, trade, rum, was, also, used, as, a, medium, of, exchange, for, example, the, slave, venture, smith, whose, history, was, later, published, had, been, purchased, in, africa, for, four, gallons, of, rum, plus, a, piece, of, calico, in, the, doctor, s, secret, journal, an, account, of, the, happenings, at, fort, michilimackinac, in, northern, michigan, from, 1769, to, 1772, by, daniel, morison, a, surgeon, s, mate, noted, that, there, was, not, much, for, the, men, to, do, and, drinking, rum, was, very, popular, in, fact, ensign, robert, johnstone, one, of, the, officers, thought, proper, to, turn, trader, by, selling, the, common, rum, to, the, soldiers, all, others, by, whom, he, might, gain, a, penny, in, this, clandestine, manner, to, conceal, this, theft, he, was, observed, to, have, filled, up, several, barrels, of, common, rum, with, boiling, water, to, make, up, the, leakage, 26, ensign, johnstone, had, no, trouble, selling, this, diluted, rum, the, popularity, of, rum, continued, after, the, american, revolution, george, washington, insisting, on, a, barrel, of, barbados, rum, at, his, 1789, inauguration, rum, started, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, political, system, candidates, attempted, to, influence, the, outcome, of, an, election, through, their, generosity, with, rum, the, people, would, attend, the, hustings, to, see, which, candidate, appeared, more, generous, the, candidate, was, expected, to, drink, with, the, people, to, show, he, was, independent, and, truly, a, republican, eventually, the, restrictions, on, sugar, imports, from, the, british, west, indies, combined, with, the, development, of, american, whiskeys, led, to, a, decline, in, the, drink, s, popularity, in, north, america, rum, s, association, with, piracy, began, with, english, privateers, trading, in, the, valuable, commodity, some, of, the, privateers, became, pirates, and, buccaneers, with, a, continuing, fondness, for, rum, the, association, between, the, two, was, only, strengthened, by, literary, works, such, as, robert, louis, stevenson, s, treasure, island, the, association, of, rum, with, the, royal, navy, began, in, 1655, when, a, royal, navy, fleet, captured, the, island, of, jamaica, with, the, availability, of, domestically, produced, rum, the, british, changed, the, daily, ration, of, liquor, given, to, seamen, from, french, brandy, to, rum, navy, rum, was, originally, a, blend, mixed, from, rums, produced, in, the, west, indies, it, was, initially, supplied, at, a, strength, of, 100, degrees, uk, proof, 57, alcohol, by, volume, abv, as, that, was, the, only, strength, that, could, be, tested, by, the, gunpowder, test, before, the, invention, of, the, hydrometer, the, term, navy, strength, is, used, in, modern, britain, to, specify, spirits, bottled, at, 57, abv, in, 1866, the, navy, fixed, the, issued, strength, at, 95, 5, proof, defined, as, 4, 5, under, proof, equal, to, 54, 6, abv, while, the, ration, was, originally, given, neat, or, mixed, with, lime, juice, the, practice, of, watering, down, the, rum, began, around, 1740, to, help, minimize, the, effect, of, the, alcohol, on, his, sailors, admiral, edward, vernon, had, the, rum, ration, watered, producing, a, mixture, that, became, known, as, grog, many, believe, the, term, was, coined, in, honour, of, the, grogram, cloak, admiral, vernon, wore, in, rough, weather, the, royal, navy, continued, to, give, its, sailors, a, daily, rum, ration, known, as, a, tot, until, the, practice, was, abolished, on, 31, july, 1970, today, a, tot, totty, of, rum, is, still, issued, on, special, occasions, using, an, order, to, splice, the, mainbrace, which, may, only, be, given, by, a, member, of, the, royal, family, or, on, certain, occasions, the, admiralty, board, in, the, uk, with, similar, restrictions, in, other, commonwealth, navies, recently, such, occasions, have, included, royal, marriages, or, birthdays, or, special, anniversaries, in, the, days, of, daily, rum, rations, the, order, to, splice, the, mainbrace, meant, double, rations, would, be, issued, a, legend, involving, naval, rum, and, horatio, nelson, says, that, following, his, victory, and, death, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, nelson, s, body, was, preserved, in, a, cask, of, rum, to, allow, transportation, back, to, england, upon, arrival, however, the, cask, was, opened, and, found, to, be, empty, of, rum, the, body, was, removed, and, upon, inspection, it, was, discovered, that, the, sailors, had, drilled, a, hole, in, the, bottom, of, the, cask, and, drunk, all, the, rum, hence, the, term, nelson, s, blood, being, used, to, describe, rum, it, also, serves, as, the, basis, for, the, term, tapping, the, admiral, being, used, to, describe, surreptitiously, sucking, liquor, from, a, cask, through, a, straw, the, details, of, the, story, are, disputed, as, many, historians, claim, the, cask, contained, french, brandy, whilst, others, claim, instead, the, term, originated, from, a, toast, to, admiral, nelson, variations, of, the, story, involving, different, notable, corpses, have, been, in, circulation, for, many, years, the, official, record, states, merely, that, the, body, was, placed, in, refined, spirits, and, does, not, go, into, further, detail, the, royal, new, zealand, navy, was, the, last, naval, force, to, give, sailors, a, free, daily, tot, of, rum, the, royal, canadian, navy, still, gives, a, rum, ration, on, special, occasions, the, rum, is, usually, provided, out, of, the, commanding, officer, s, fund, and, is, 150, proof, 75, the, order, to, splice, the, mainbrace, i, e, take, rum, can, be, given, by, the, king, as, commander, in, chief, as, occurred, on, 29, june, 2010, when, previous, monarch, queen, elizabeth, ii, gave, the, order, to, the, royal, canadian, navy, as, part, of, the, celebration, of, their, 100th, anniversary, rum, became, an, important, trade, good, in, the, early, period, of, the, colony, of, new, south, wales, the, value, of, rum, was, based, upon, the, lack, of, coinage, among, the, population, of, the, colony, and, due, to, the, drink, s, ability, to, allow, its, consumer, to, temporarily, forget, about, the, lack, of, creature, comforts, available, in, the, new, colony, the, value, of, rum, was, such, that, convict, settlers, could, be, induced, to, work, the, lands, owned, by, officers, of, the, new, south, wales, corps, due, to, rum, s, popularity, among, the, settlers, the, colony, gained, a, reputation, for, drunkenness, though, their, alcohol, consumption, was, less, than, levels, commonly, consumed, in, england, at, the, time, australia, was, so, far, away, from, britain, that, the, penal, colony, established, in, 1788, faced, severe, food, shortages, compounded, by, poor, conditions, for, growing, crops, and, the, shortage, of, livestock, eventually, it, was, realized, that, it, might, be, cheaper, for, india, instead, of, britain, to, supply, the, settlement, of, sydney, by, 1817, two, out, of, every, three, ships, which, left, sydney, went, to, java, or, india, and, cargoes, from, bengal, fed, and, equipped, the, colony, casks, of, bengal, rum, which, was, reputed, to, be, stronger, than, jamaican, rum, and, not, so, sweet, were, brought, back, in, the, depths, of, nearly, every, ship, from, india, the, cargoes, were, floated, ashore, clandestinely, before, the, ships, docked, by, the, royal, marines, regiment, which, controlled, the, sales, it, was, against, the, direct, orders, of, the, governors, who, had, ordered, the, searching, of, every, docking, ship, british, merchants, in, india, grew, wealthy, by, sending, ships, to, sydney, laden, half, with, rice, and, half, with, bad, spirits, rum, was, intimately, involved, in, the, only, military, takeover, of, an, australian, government, known, as, the, rum, rebellion, when, william, bligh, became, governor, of, the, colony, he, attempted, to, remedy, the, perceived, problem, of, drunkenness, by, outlawing, the, use, of, rum, as, a, medium, of, exchange, in, response, to, bligh, s, attempt, to, regulate, the, use, of, rum, in, 1808, the, new, south, wales, corps, marched, with, fixed, bayonets, to, government, house, and, placed, bligh, under, arrest, the, mutineers, continued, to, control, the, colony, until, the, arrival, of, governor, lachlan, macquarie, in, 1810, in, india, rum, was, not, traditionally, produced, as, the, production, processes, used, to, make, jaggery, from, sugarcane, do, not, produce, molasses, as, a, by, product, rum, was, not, produced, in, india, commercially, until, the, introduction, of, cane, sugar, production, processes, which, did, the, production, of, spirits, along, with, the, core, commodity, of, sugar, allowed, for, these, plantations, to, have, high, economic, returns, production, expanded, rapidly, to, meet, both, domestic, and, export, markets, however, exports, to, great, britain, were, restricted, by, protectionist, policies, rum, production, continued, after, the, end, of, the, colonial, era, today, most, spirits, produced, in, india, labeled, as, whisky, vodka, and, gin, are, made, with, a, neutral, rum, derived, base, old, monk, is, the, primary, brand, of, dark, rum, consumed, in, contemporary, india, commercial, rum, production, was, introduced, into, taiwan, along, with, commercial, sugar, production, during, the, japanese, colonial, period, rum, production, continued, under, the, republic, of, china, however, it, was, neglected, by, taiwan, tobacco, and, liquor, corporation, which, held, the, national, liquor, monopoly, the, industry, diversified, after, privatization, and, the, de, monopolization, of, the, taiwanese, alcoholic, beverage, industry, dividing, rum, into, meaningful, groupings, is, complicated, because, no, single, standard, exists, for, what, constitutes, rum, instead, rum, is, defined, by, the, varying, rules, and, laws, of, the, nations, producing, the, spirit, the, differences, in, definitions, include, issues, such, as, spirit, proof, minimum, ageing, and, even, naming, standards, mexico, requires, rum, be, aged, a, minimum, of, eight, months, the, dominican, republic, panama, and, venezuela, require, two, years, naming, standards, also, vary, argentina, defines, rums, as, white, gold, light, and, extra, light, grenada, and, barbados, use, the, terms, white, overproof, and, matured, while, the, united, states, defines, rum, rum, liqueur, and, flavored, rum, in, australia, rum, is, divided, into, dark, or, red, rum, underproof, known, as, up, overproof, known, as, op, and, triple, distilled, and, white, rum, despite, these, differences, in, standards, and, nomenclature, the, following, divisions, are, provided, to, help, show, the, wide, variety, of, rums, produced, within, the, caribbean, each, island, or, production, area, has, a, unique, style, for, the, most, part, these, styles, can, be, grouped, by, the, language, traditionally, spoken, due, to, the, overwhelming, influence, of, puerto, rican, rum, most, rum, consumed, in, the, united, states, is, produced, in, the, spanish, speaking, style, cacha, a, is, a, spirit, similar, to, rum, that, is, produced, in, brazil, cachaca, also, comes, from, sugar, cane, some, countries, including, the, united, states, classify, cacha, a, as, a, type, of, rum, seco, from, panama, is, also, a, spirit, similar, to, rum, which, is, triple, distilled, similar, to, some, vodka, mexico, produces, a, number, of, brands, of, light, and, dark, rum, as, well, as, other, less, expensive, flavored, and, unflavored, sugarcane, based, liquors, such, as, aguardiente, de, ca, a, and, charanda, aguardiente, is, also, the, name, for, unaged, distilled, cane, spirit, in, some, primarily, spanish, speaking, countries, since, their, definition, of, rum, includes, at, least, two, years, of, ageing, in, wood, a, spirit, known, as, aguardiente, distilled, from, molasses, and, often, infused, with, anise, with, additional, sugarcane, juice, added, after, distillation, is, produced, in, central, america, and, northern, south, america, in, west, africa, and, particularly, in, liberia, cane, juice, also, known, as, liberian, rum, or, simply, cj, within, liberia, itself, is, a, cheap, strong, spirit, distilled, from, sugarcane, which, can, be, as, strong, as, 43, abv, 86, proof, a, refined, cane, spirit, has, also, been, produced, in, south, africa, since, the, 1950s, simply, known, as, cane, or, spook, within, europe, in, the, czech, republic, and, slovakia, a, similar, spirit, made, from, sugar, beet, is, known, as, tuzemak, in, germany, a, cheap, substitute, for, genuine, dark, rum, is, called, rum, verschnitt, literally, blended, or, cut, rum, this, drink, is, made, of, genuine, dark, rum, often, high, ester, rum, from, jamaica, rectified, spirit, and, water, very, often, caramel, coloring, is, used, too, the, relative, amount, of, genuine, rum, it, contains, can, be, quite, low, since, the, legal, minimum, is, only, 5, in, austria, a, similar, rum, called, inl, nderrum, or, domestic, rum, is, available, however, austrian, inl, nderrum, is, always, a, spiced, rum, such, as, the, brand, stroh, german, rum, verschnitt, in, contrast, is, never, spiced, or, flavored, the, grades, and, variations, used, to, describe, rum, depend, on, the, location, where, rum, was, produced, despite, these, variations, the, following, terms, are, frequently, used, to, describe, various, types, of, rum, unlike, some, other, spirits, rum, has, no, defined, production, methods, instead, rum, production, is, based, on, traditional, styles, that, vary, between, locations, and, distillers, sugarcane, is, traditionally, collected, by, sugarcane, machete, cutters, who, cut, the, cane, near, to, the, ground, where, the, largest, concentration, of, sugars, is, found, before, lopping, off, the, green, tips, a, good, cutter, can, cut, three, tons, of, cane, per, day, on, average, but, this, is, a, small, fraction, of, what, a, machine, can, cut, therefore, mechanised, harvesting, is, now, utilized, sugarcane, comprises, around, 63, to, 73, water, 12, to, 16, soluble, sugar, 2, to, 3, non, sugars, and, 11, to, 16, fiber, to, extract, the, water, and, sugar, juice, the, harvested, cane, is, cleaned, sliced, into, small, lengths, and, milled, pressed, most, rum, is, produced, from, molasses, which, is, made, from, sugarcane, a, rum, s, quality, is, dependent, on, the, quality, and, variety, of, the, sugar, cane, that, was, used, to, create, it, the, sugar, cane, s, quality, depends, on, the, soil, type, and, climate, that, it, was, grown, in, within, the, caribbean, much, of, this, molasses, is, from, brazil, a, notable, exception, is, the, french, speaking, islands, where, sugarcane, juice, is, the, preferred, base, ingredient, in, brazil, itself, the, distilled, alcoholic, drink, derived, from, cane, juice, is, distinguished, from, rum, and, called, cacha, a, yeast, and, water, are, added, to, the, base, ingredient, to, start, the, fermentation, process, while, some, rum, producers, allow, wild, yeasts, to, perform, the, fermentation, most, use, specific, strains, of, yeast, to, help, provide, a, consistent, taste, and, predictable, fermentation, time, dunder, the, yeast, rich, foam, from, previous, fermentations, is, the, traditional, yeast, source, in, jamaica, the, yeast, employed, will, determine, the, final, taste, and, aroma, profile, says, jamaican, master, blender, joy, spence, distillers, that, make, lighter, rums, such, as, bacardi, prefer, to, use, faster, working, yeasts, the, use, of, slower, working, yeasts, causes, more, esters, to, accumulate, during, fermentation, allowing, for, a, fuller, tasting, rum, fermentation, products, like, 2, ethyl, 3, methyl, butyric, acid, and, esters, like, ethyl, butyrate, and, ethyl, hexanoate, give, rise, to, the, sweetness, and, fruitiness, of, rum, the, fermented, product, is, then, distilled, as, with, all, other, aspects, of, rum, production, no, standard, method, is, used, for, distillation, while, some, producers, work, in, batches, using, pot, stills, most, rum, production, is, done, using, column, still, distillation, pot, still, output, contains, more, congeners, than, the, output, from, column, stills, so, produces, fuller, tasting, rums, many, countries, require, rum, to, be, aged, for, at, least, one, year, this, ageing, is, commonly, performed, in, used, bourbon, casks, but, may, also, be, performed, in, other, types, of, wooden, casks, or, stainless, steel, tanks, the, ageing, process, determines, the, colour, of, the, rum, when, aged, in, oak, casks, it, becomes, dark, whereas, rum, aged, in, stainless, steel, tanks, remains, virtually, colourless, due, to, the, tropical, climate, common, to, most, rum, producing, areas, rum, matures, at, a, much, faster, rate, than, is, typical, for, whisky, or, brandy, i, e, achieving, a, similar, level, of, maturity, takes, considerably, less, time, an, indication, of, this, higher, rate, is, the, angels, share, or, the, amount, of, product, lost, to, evaporation, while, products, aged, in, france, or, scotland, see, about, a, 2, loss, each, year, tropical, rum, producers, may, see, as, much, as, 10, after, ageing, rum, is, normally, blended, to, ensure, a, consistent, flavour, the, final, step, in, the, rum, making, process, during, blending, light, rums, may, be, filtered, to, remove, any, colour, gained, during, ageing, for, dark, rums, caramel, may, be, added, for, colour, there, have, been, attempts, to, match, the, molecular, composition, of, aged, rum, in, significantly, shorter, time, spans, with, artificial, ageing, using, heat, and, light, besides, rum, punches, cocktails, such, as, the, cuba, libre, and, daiquiri, have, stories, of, their, invention, in, the, caribbean, tiki, bars, in, the, u, s, helped, expand, rum, s, horizons, with, inventions, such, as, the, mai, tai, and, zombie, other, cocktails, containing, rum, include, the, pi, a, colada, a, drink, made, popular, in, america, by, rupert, holmes, song, escape, and, the, mojito, cold, weather, drinks, made, with, rum, include, the, rum, toddy, and, hot, buttered, rum, a, number, of, local, specialties, also, use, rum, including, bermuda, s, dark, n, stormy, gosling, s, black, seal, rum, with, ginger, beer, the, painkiller, from, the, british, virgin, islands, and, a, new, orleans, cocktail, known, as, the, hurricane, jagertee, is, a, mixture, of, rum, and, black, tea, popular,
