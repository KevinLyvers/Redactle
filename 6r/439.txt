cue, sports, are, a, wide, variety, of, games, of, skill, played, with, a, cue, which, is, used, to, strike, billiard, balls, and, thereby, cause, them, to, move, around, a, cloth, covered, table, bounded, by, elastic, bumpers, known, as, cushions, cue, sports, are, also, collectively, referred, to, as, billiards, though, this, term, has, more, specific, connotations, in, some, varieties, of, english, there, are, three, major, subdivisions, of, games, within, cue, sports, billiards, has, a, long, history, from, its, inception, in, the, 15th, century, with, many, mentions, in, the, works, of, shakespeare, including, the, line, let, s, to, billiards, in, antony, and, cleopatra, 1606, 07, enthusiasts, of, the, sport, have, included, mozart, louis, xiv, of, france, marie, antoinette, immanuel, kant, napoleon, abraham, lincoln, mark, twain, george, washington, jules, gr, vy, charles, dickens, george, armstrong, custer, theodore, roosevelt, lewis, carroll, w, c, fields, babe, ruth, bob, hope, and, jackie, gleason, all, cue, sports, are, generally, regarded, to, have, evolved, into, indoor, games, from, outdoor, stick, and, ball, lawn, games, specifically, those, retroactively, termed, ground, billiards, and, as, such, to, be, related, to, the, historical, games, jeu, de, mail, and, palle, malle, and, modern, trucco, croquet, and, golf, and, more, distantly, to, the, stickless, bocce, and, bowls, the, word, billiard, may, have, evolved, from, the, french, word, billart, or, billette, meaning, stick, in, reference, to, the, mace, an, implement, similar, to, a, golf, putter, and, which, was, the, forerunner, to, the, modern, cue, however, the, term, s, origin, could, have, been, from, french, bille, meaning, ball, the, modern, term, cue, sports, can, be, used, to, encompass, the, ancestral, mace, games, and, even, the, modern, cueless, variants, such, as, finger, billiards, for, historical, reasons, cue, itself, came, from, queue, the, french, word, for, tail, this, refers, to, the, early, practice, of, using, the, tail, or, butt, of, the, mace, instead, of, its, club, foot, to, strike, the, ball, when, it, lay, against, a, rail, cushion, a, recognizable, form, of, billiards, was, played, outdoors, in, the, 1340s, and, was, reminiscent, of, croquet, king, louis, xi, of, france, 1461, 1483, had, the, first, known, indoor, billiard, table, louis, xiv, further, refined, and, popularized, the, game, and, it, swiftly, spread, among, the, french, nobility, while, the, game, had, long, been, played, on, the, ground, this, version, appears, to, have, died, out, aside, from, trucco, in, the, 17th, century, in, favor, of, croquet, golf, and, bowling, games, even, as, table, billiards, had, grown, in, popularity, as, an, indoor, activity, the, imprisoned, mary, queen, of, scots, complained, when, her, table, de, billiard, was, taken, away, by, those, who, eventually, became, her, executioners, who, were, to, cover, her, body, with, the, table, s, cloth, a, 1588, inventory, of, the, duke, of, norfolk, s, estate, included, a, billyard, bord, coered, with, a, greene, cloth, three, billyard, sticks, and, 11, balls, of, yvery, billiards, grew, to, the, extent, that, by, 1727, it, was, being, played, in, almost, every, paris, caf, in, england, the, game, was, developing, into, a, very, popular, activity, for, members, of, the, gentry, by, 1670, the, thin, butt, end, of, the, mace, began, to, be, used, not, only, for, shots, under, the, cushion, which, itself, was, originally, only, there, as, a, preventative, method, to, stop, balls, from, rolling, off, but, players, increasingly, preferred, it, for, other, shots, as, well, the, footless, straight, cue, as, it, is, known, today, was, finally, developed, by, about, 1800, initially, the, mace, was, used, to, push, the, balls, rather, than, strike, them, the, newly, developed, striking, cue, provided, a, new, challenge, cushions, began, to, be, stuffed, with, substances, to, allow, the, balls, to, rebound, in, order, to, enhance, the, appeal, of, the, game, after, a, transitional, period, where, only, the, better, players, would, use, cues, the, cue, came, to, be, the, first, choice, of, equipment, the, demand, for, tables, and, other, equipment, was, initially, met, in, europe, by, john, thurston, and, other, furniture, makers, of, the, era, the, early, balls, were, made, from, wood, and, clay, but, the, rich, preferred, to, use, ivory, early, billiard, games, involved, various, pieces, of, additional, equipment, including, the, arch, related, to, the, croquet, hoop, port, a, different, hoop, often, rectangular, and, king, a, pin, or, skittle, near, the, arch, in, the, early, 17th, to, late, 18th, century, but, other, game, variants, relying, on, the, cushions, and, pockets, cut, into, them, were, being, formed, that, would, go, on, to, play, fundamental, roles, in, the, development, of, modern, billiards, the, early, croquet, like, games, eventually, led, to, the, development, of, the, carom, billiards, category, these, games, are, played, with, three, or, sometimes, four, balls, on, a, table, without, holes, in, which, the, goal, is, generally, to, strike, one, object, ball, with, a, cue, ball, then, have, the, cue, ball, rebound, off, of, one, or, more, of, the, cushions, and, strike, a, second, object, ball, variations, include, straight, rail, balkline, one, cushion, three, cushion, five, pins, and, four, ball, among, others, one, type, of, obstacle, remained, a, feature, of, many, tables, originally, as, a, hazard, and, later, as, a, target, in, the, form, of, pockets, or, holes, partly, cut, into, the, table, bed, and, partly, into, the, cushions, leading, to, the, rise, of, pocket, billiards, including, pool, games, such, as, eight, ball, nine, ball, straight, pool, and, one, pocket, russian, pyramid, snooker, english, billiards, and, others, in, the, united, states, pool, and, billiards, had, died, out, for, a, bit, but, between, 1878, and, 1956, the, games, became, very, popular, players, in, annual, championships, began, to, receive, their, own, cigarette, cards, this, was, mainly, due, to, the, fact, that, it, was, a, popular, pastime, for, troops, to, take, their, minds, off, battle, however, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, pool, and, billiards, began, to, die, down, once, again, it, was, not, until, 1961, when, the, film, the, hustler, came, out, that, sparked, a, new, interest, in, the, game, now, the, game, is, generally, well, known, and, has, many, players, of, all, different, skill, levels, the, games, with, regulated, international, professional, competition, if, not, others, have, been, referred, to, as, sports, or, sporting, events, not, simply, games, since, 1893, at, the, latest, quite, a, variety, of, particular, games, i, e, sets, of, rules, and, equipment, are, the, subject, of, present, day, competition, including, many, of, those, already, mentioned, with, competition, being, especially, broad, in, nine, ball, snooker, three, cushion, and, eight, ball, snooker, though, a, pocket, billiards, variant, and, closely, related, in, its, equipment, and, origin, to, the, game, of, english, billiards, is, a, professional, sport, organized, at, an, international, level, and, its, rules, bear, little, resemblance, to, those, of, modern, pool, pyramid, and, other, such, games, a, billiards, category, encompassing, pool, snooker, and, carom, has, been, part, of, the, world, games, since, 2001, billiard, balls, vary, from, game, to, game, in, size, design, and, quantity, russian, pyramid, and, kaisa, have, a, size, of, 68, mm, 2, 11, 16, in, in, russian, pyramid, there, are, 16, balls, as, in, pool, but, 15, are, white, and, numbered, and, the, cue, ball, is, usually, red, in, kaisa, five, balls, are, used, the, yellow, object, ball, called, the, kaisa, in, finnish, two, red, object, balls, and, the, two, white, cue, balls, usually, differentiated, by, one, cue, ball, having, a, dot, or, other, marking, on, it, and, each, of, which, serves, as, an, object, ball, for, the, opponent, carom, billiards, balls, are, larger, than, pool, balls, having, a, diameter, of, 61, 5, mm, 2, 7, 16, in, and, come, as, a, set, of, two, cue, balls, one, colored, or, marked, and, an, object, ball, or, two, object, balls, in, the, case, of, the, game, four, ball, standard, pool, balls, are, 57, 15, mm, 2, 1, 4, in, are, used, in, many, pool, games, found, throughout, the, world, come, in, sets, of, two, suits, of, object, balls, seven, solids, and, seven, stripes, an, 8, ball, and, a, cue, ball, the, balls, are, racked, differently, for, different, games, some, of, which, do, not, use, the, entire, ball, set, blackball, english, style, eight, ball, sets, are, similar, but, have, unmarked, groups, of, red, and, yellow, balls, instead, of, solids, and, stripes, known, as, casino, style, they, are, used, principally, in, britain, ireland, and, some, commonwealth, countries, though, not, exclusively, since, they, are, unsuited, for, playing, nine, ball, the, diameter, varies, but, is, typically, slightly, smaller, than, that, of, standard, solids, and, stripes, sets, snooker, balls, are, smaller, than, american, style, pool, balls, with, a, diameter, of, 52, 5, mm, 2, 1, 16, in, and, come, in, sets, of, 22, 15, reds, 6, colours, and, a, cue, ball, english, billiard, balls, are, the, same, size, as, snooker, balls, and, come, in, sets, of, three, balls, two, cue, balls, and, a, red, object, ball, other, games, such, as, bumper, pool, have, custom, ball, sets, billiard, balls, have, been, made, from, many, different, materials, since, the, start, of, the, game, including, clay, bakelite, celluloid, crystallite, ivory, plastic, steel, and, wood, the, dominant, material, from, 1627, until, the, early, 20th, century, was, ivory, the, search, for, a, substitute, for, ivory, use, was, not, for, environmental, concerns, but, based, on, economic, motivation, and, fear, of, danger, for, elephant, hunters, it, was, in, part, spurred, on, by, a, new, york, billiard, table, manufacturer, who, announced, a, prize, of, 10, 000, for, a, substitute, material, the, first, viable, substitute, was, celluloid, invented, by, john, wesley, hyatt, in, 1868, but, the, material, was, volatile, sometimes, exploding, during, manufacture, and, was, highly, flammable, there, are, many, sizes, and, styles, of, billiard, tables, generally, tables, are, rectangles, twice, as, long, as, they, are, wide, table, sizes, are, typically, referred, to, by, the, nominal, length, of, their, longer, dimension, full, size, snooker, tables, are, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, long, carom, billiards, tables, are, typically, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, regulation, pool, tables, are, 9, foot, 2, 7, m, though, pubs, and, other, establishments, catering, to, casual, play, will, typically, use, 7, foot, 2, 1, m, tables, which, are, often, coin, operated, nicknamed, bar, boxes, formerly, ten, foot, pool, tables, were, common, but, such, tables, are, now, considered, antiques, high, quality, tables, have, a, bed, made, of, thick, slate, in, three, pieces, to, prevent, warping, and, changes, due, to, temperature, and, humidity, the, slates, on, modern, carom, tables, are, usually, heated, to, stave, off, moisture, and, provide, a, consistent, playing, surface, smaller, bar, tables, are, most, commonly, made, with, a, single, piece, of, slate, pocket, billiards, tables, of, all, types, normally, have, six, pockets, three, on, each, side, four, corner, pockets, and, two, side, or, middle, pockets, all, types, of, tables, are, covered, with, billiard, cloth, often, called, felt, but, actually, a, woven, wool, or, wool, nylon, blend, called, baize, cloth, has, been, used, to, cover, billiards, tables, since, the, 15th, century, bar, or, tavern, tables, which, get, a, lot, of, play, use, slower, more, durable, cloth, the, cloth, used, in, upscale, pool, and, snooker, halls, and, home, billiard, rooms, is, faster, i, e, provides, less, friction, allowing, the, balls, to, roll, farther, across, the, table, bed, and, competition, quality, pool, cloth, is, made, from, 100, worsted, wool, snooker, cloth, traditionally, has, a, nap, consistent, fiber, directionality, and, balls, behave, differently, when, rolling, against, versus, along, with, the, nap, the, cloth, of, the, billiard, table, has, traditionally, been, green, reflecting, its, origin, originally, the, grass, of, ancestral, lawn, games, and, has, been, so, colored, since, at, least, the, 16th, century, but, it, is, also, produced, in, other, colors, such, as, red, and, blue, television, broadcasting, of, pool, as, well, as, 3, cushion, billiards, prefers, a, blue, colored, cloth, which, was, chosen, for, better, visibility, and, contrast, against, colored, balls, a, rack, is, the, name, given, to, a, frame, usually, wood, plastic, or, aluminium, used, to, organize, billiard, balls, at, the, beginning, of, a, game, this, is, traditionally, triangular, in, shape, but, varies, with, the, type, of, billiards, played, there, are, two, main, types, of, racks, the, more, common, triangular, shape, which, is, used, for, eight, ball, and, straight, pool, and, the, diamond, shaped, rack, used, for, nine, ball, there, are, several, other, types, of, less, common, rack, types, that, are, also, used, based, on, a, template, to, hold, the, billiard, balls, tightly, together, most, commonly, it, is, a, thin, plastic, sheet, with, diamond, shaped, cut, outs, that, hold, the, balls, that, is, placed, on, the, table, with, the, balls, set, on, top, of, the, rack, the, rack, is, used, to, set, up, the, break, and, removed, once, the, break, has, been, completed, and, no, balls, are, obstructing, the, template, billiards, games, are, mostly, played, with, a, stick, known, as, a, cue, a, cue, is, usually, either, a, one, piece, tapered, stick, or, a, two, piece, stick, divided, in, the, middle, by, a, joint, of, metal, or, phenolic, resin, high, quality, cues, are, generally, two, pieces, and, are, made, of, a, hardwood, generally, maple, for, billiards, and, ash, for, snooker, the, butt, end, of, the, cue, is, of, larger, circumference, and, is, intended, to, be, gripped, by, a, player, s, hand, the, shaft, of, the, cue, is, of, smaller, circumference, usually, tapering, to, an, 0, 4, to, 0, 55, inches, 10, to, 14, mm, terminus, called, a, ferrule, usually, made, of, fiberglass, or, brass, in, better, cues, where, a, rounded, leather, tip, is, affixed, flush, with, the, ferrule, to, make, final, contact, with, balls, the, tip, in, conjunction, with, chalk, can, be, used, to, impart, spin, to, the, cue, ball, when, it, is, not, hit, in, its, center, cheap, cues, are, generally, made, of, pine, low, grade, maple, and, formerly, often, of, ramin, which, is, now, endangered, or, other, low, quality, wood, with, inferior, plastic, ferrules, a, quality, cue, can, be, expensive, and, may, be, made, of, exotic, woods, and, other, expensive, materials, which, are, artfully, inlaid, in, decorative, patterns, many, modern, cues, are, also, made, like, golf, clubs, with, high, tech, materials, such, as, woven, graphite, recently, carbon, fiber, woven, composites, have, been, developed, and, utilized, by, top, professional, players, and, amateurs, advantages, include, less, flexibility, and, no, worry, of, nicks, scratches, or, damages, to, the, cue, skilled, players, may, use, more, than, one, cue, during, a, game, including, a, separate, cue, with, a, hard, phenolic, resin, tip, for, the, opening, break, shot, and, another, shorter, cue, with, a, special, tip, for, jump, shots, the, mechanical, bridge, sometimes, called, a, rake, crutch, bridge, stick, or, simply, bridge, and, in, the, uk, a, rest, is, used, to, extend, a, player, s, reach, on, a, shot, where, the, cue, ball, is, too, far, away, for, normal, hand, bridging, it, consists, of, a, stick, with, a, grooved, metal, or, plastic, head, which, the, cue, slides, on, some, players, especially, current, or, former, snooker, players, use, a, screw, on, cue, butt, extension, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, the, mechanical, bridge, bridge, head, design, is, varied, and, not, all, designs, especially, those, with, cue, shaft, enclosing, rings, or, wheels, on, the, bottom, of, the, head, are, broadly, tournament, approved, in, italy, a, longer, thicker, cue, is, typically, available, for, this, kind, of, tricky, shot, for, snooker, bridges, are, normally, available, in, three, forms, their, use, depending, on, how, the, player, is, hampered, the, standard, rest, is, a, simple, cross, the, spider, has, a, raised, arch, around, 12, cm, with, three, grooves, to, rest, the, cue, in, and, for, the, most, awkward, of, shots, the, giraffe, or, swan, in, england, which, has, a, raised, arch, much, like, the, spider, but, with, a, slender, arm, reaching, out, around, 15, cm, with, the, groove, chalk, is, applied, to, the, tip, of, the, cue, stick, ideally, before, every, shot, to, increase, the, tip, s, friction, coefficient, so, that, when, it, impacts, the, cue, ball, on, a, non, center, hit, no, miscue, unintentional, slippage, between, the, cue, tip, and, the, struck, ball, occurs, chalk, is, an, important, element, to, make, good, shots, in, pool, or, snooker, cue, tip, chalk, is, not, actually, the, substance, typically, referred, to, as, chalk, generally, calcium, carbonate, but, any, of, several, proprietary, compounds, with, a, silicate, base, it, was, around, the, time, of, the, industrial, revolution, that, newer, compounds, formed, that, provided, better, grip, for, the, ball, this, is, when, the, english, began, to, experiment, with, side, spin, or, applying, curl, to, the, ball, this, was, shortly, introduced, to, the, american, players, and, is, how, the, term, putting, english, on, the, ball, came, to, be, chalk, may, also, refer, to, a, cone, of, fine, white, hand, chalk, like, talc, talcum, powder, it, can, be, used, to, reduce, friction, between, the, cue, and, bridge, hand, during, shooting, for, a, smoother, stroke, some, brands, of, hand, chalk, are, made, of, compressed, talc, tip, chalk, is, not, used, for, this, purpose, because, it, is, abrasive, hand, staining, and, difficult, to, apply, many, players, prefer, a, slick, pool, glove, over, hand, chalk, or, talc, because, of, the, messiness, of, these, powders, buildup, of, particles, on, the, cloth, will, affect, ball, behavior, and, necessitate, more, frequent, cloth, cleaning, cue, tip, chalk, invented, in, its, modern, form, by, straight, rail, billiard, pro, william, a, spinks, and, chemist, william, hoskins, in, 1897, is, made, by, crushing, silica, and, the, abrasive, substance, corundum, or, aloxite, aluminium, oxide, into, a, powder, it, is, combined, with, dye, originally, and, most, commonly, green, or, blue, green, like, traditional, billiard, cloth, but, available, today, like, the, cloth, in, many, colours, and, a, binder, glue, each, manufacturer, s, brand, has, different, qualities, which, can, significantly, affect, play, high, humidity, can, also, impair, the, effectiveness, of, chalk, harder, drier, compounds, are, generally, considered, superior, by, most, players, there, are, two, main, varieties, of, billiard, games, carom, and, pocket, the, main, carom, billiards, games, are, straight, rail, balkline, and, three, cushion, billiards, all, are, played, on, a, pocketless, table, with, three, balls, two, cue, balls, and, one, object, ball, in, all, players, shoot, a, cue, ball, so, that, it, makes, contact, with, the, opponent, s, cue, ball, as, well, as, the, object, ball, others, of, multinational, interest, are, four, ball, and, five, pins, the, most, globally, popular, of, the, large, variety, of, pocket, games, are, pool, and, snooker, a, third, english, billiards, has, some, features, of, carom, billiards, english, billiards, used, to, be, one, of, the, two, most, competitive, cue, sports, along, with, the, carom, game, balkline, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, is, still, enjoyed, today, in, commonwealth, countries, another, pocket, game, russian, pyramid, and, its, variants, like, kaisa, are, popular, in, the, former, eastern, bloc, in, straight, rail, a, player, scores, a, point, and, may, continue, shooting, each, time, his, cue, ball, makes, contact, with, both, other, balls, some, of, the, best, players, of, straight, billiards, developed, the, skill, to, gather, the, balls, in, a, corner, or, along, the, same, rail, for, the, purpose, of, playing, a, series, of, nurse, shots, to, score, a, seemingly, limitless, number, of, points, the, first, straight, rail, professional, tournament, was, held, in, 1879, where, jacob, schaefer, sr, scored, 690, points, in, a, single, turn, that, is, 690, separate, strokes, without, a, miss, with, the, balls, repetitively, hit, and, barely, moving, in, endless, nursing, there, was, little, for, the, fans, to, watch, in, light, of, these, skill, developments, in, straight, rail, the, game, of, balkline, soon, developed, to, make, it, impossible, for, a, player, to, keep, the, balls, gathered, in, one, part, of, the, table, for, long, greatly, limiting, the, effectiveness, of, nurse, shots, a, balkline, is, a, line, parallel, to, one, end, of, a, billiards, table, in, the, game, of, balkline, the, players, have, to, drive, at, least, one, object, ball, past, a, balkline, parallel, to, each, rail, after, a, specified, number, of, points, have, been, scored, another, solution, was, to, require, a, player, s, cue, ball, to, make, contact, with, the, rail, cushions, in, the, process, of, contacting, the, other, balls, this, in, turn, saw, the, three, cushion, version, emerge, where, the, cue, ball, must, make, three, separate, cushion, contacts, during, a, shot, this, is, difficult, enough, that, even, the, best, players, can, only, manage, to, average, one, to, two, points, per, turn, this, is, sometimes, described, as, hardest, to, learn, and, require, most, skill, of, all, billiards, there, are, many, variations, of, games, played, on, a, standard, pool, table, popular, pool, games, include, eight, ball, nine, ball, straight, pool, and, one, pocket, even, within, games, types, e, g, eight, ball, there, may, be, variations, and, people, may, play, recreationally, using, relaxed, or, local, rules, a, few, of, the, more, popular, examples, of, pool, games, are, given, below, in, eight, ball, and, nine, ball, the, object, is, to, sink, object, balls, until, one, can, legally, pocket, the, winning, eponymous, money, ball, well, known, but, waning, in, popularity, is, straight, pool, in, which, players, seek, to, continue, sinking, balls, rack, after, rack, if, they, can, to, reach, a, pre, determined, winning, score, typically, 150, related, to, nine, ball, another, well, known, game, is, rotation, where, the, lowest, numbered, object, ball, on, the, table, must, be, struck, first, although, any, object, ball, may, be, pocketed, i, e, combination, shot, each, pocketed, ball, is, worth, its, number, and, the, player, with, the, highest, score, at, the, end, of, the, rack, is, the, winner, since, there, are, only, 120, points, available, 1, 2, 3, 15, 120, scoring, 61, points, leaves, no, opportunity, for, the, opponent, to, catch, up, in, both, one, pocket, and, bank, pool, the, players, must, sink, a, set, number, of, balls, respectively, all, in, a, particular, pocket, or, all, by, bank, shots, in, snooker, players, score, points, by, alternately, potting, red, balls, and, various, special, colour, balls, speed, pool, is, a, standard, billiards, game, where, the, balls, must, be, pocketed, in, as, little, time, as, possible, rules, vary, greatly, from, tournament, to, tournament, the, international, speed, pool, challenge, has, been, held, annually, since, 2006, dating, to, approximately, 1800, english, billiards, called, simply, billiards, in, many, former, british, colonies, and, in, the, uk, where, it, originated, was, originally, called, the, winning, and, losing, carambole, game, folding, in, the, names, of, three, predecessor, games, the, winning, game, the, losing, game, and, the, carambole, game, an, early, form, of, straight, rail, that, combined, to, form, it, the, game,
