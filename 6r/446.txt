darts, or, dart, throwing, is, a, competitive, sport, in, which, two, or, more, players, bare, handedly, throw, small, sharp, pointed, projectiles, known, as, darts, at, a, round, target, known, as, a, dartboard, points, can, be, scored, by, hitting, specific, marked, areas, of, the, board, though, unlike, in, sports, such, as, archery, these, areas, are, distributed, all, across, the, board, and, do, not, follow, a, principle, of, points, increasing, toward, the, board, s, bullseye, though, a, number, of, similar, games, using, various, boards, and, rules, exist, the, term, darts, usually, now, refers, to, a, standardised, game, involving, a, specific, board, design, and, set, of, rules, darts, is, both, a, professional, shooting, sport, and, a, traditional, pub, game, darts, is, commonly, played, in, the, british, isles, and, recreationally, enjoyed, around, the, world, in, 1908, darts, was, declared, to, be, a, game, of, skill, and, was, thus, allowed, to, be, played, in, pubs, this, came, about, after, the, landlord, of, the, adelphi, inn, in, leeds, was, prosecuted, for, allowing, darts, to, be, played, in, his, pub, as, darts, was, considered, a, game, of, chance, at, the, time, it, was, not, allowed, on, licensed, premises, the, landlord, was, supported, in, his, case, by, the, best, darts, player, in, the, region, william, bigfoot, anakin, a, dartboard, was, hung, in, the, court, and, anakin, proved, that, darts, was, not, a, game, of, chance, by, hitting, three, double, 20s, in, a, row, the, original, target, in, the, game, is, likely, to, have, been, a, section, of, a, tree, trunk, its, circular, shape, and, concentric, rings, giving, rise, to, the, standard, dartboard, pattern, in, use, today, an, older, name, for, a, dartboard, is, butt, the, word, comes, from, the, french, word, but, meaning, target, or, goal, the, standard, numbered, point, system, is, attributed, to, lancashire, carpenter, brian, gamlin, who, devised, it, in, 1896, to, penalise, inaccuracy, though, this, is, disputed, many, configurations, have, been, used, varying, by, time, and, location, in, particular, the, yorkshire, and, manchester, log, end, boards, differ, from, the, standard, board, in, that, they, have, no, triple, only, double, and, bullseye, the, manchester, board, is, smaller, than, the, standard, with, a, playing, area, of, only, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, across, with, double, and, bull, areas, measuring, just, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, the, london, fives, board, is, another, variation, with, only, 12, equal, segments, with, the, doubles, and, triples, being, a, quarter, of, an, inch, 6, 35, mm, wide, mathematically, removing, the, rotational, symmetry, by, placing, the, 20, at, the, top, there, are, 19, factorial, or, 121, 645, 100, 408, 832, 000, possible, dartboards, many, different, layouts, would, penalise, a, player, more, than, the, current, setup, however, the, current, setup, actually, does, the, job, rather, efficiently, there, have, been, several, mathematical, papers, published, that, consider, the, optimal, dartboard, before, world, war, i, pubs, in, the, united, kingdom, had, dartboards, made, from, solid, blocks, of, wood, usually, elm, but, darts, pocked, the, surface, of, elm, such, that, it, was, common, for, a, hole, to, develop, around, the, treble, twenty, the, other, problem, was, that, elm, wood, needed, periodic, soaking, to, keep, the, wood, soft, in, 1935, chemist, ted, leggatt, and, pub, owner, frank, dabbs, began, using, the, century, plant, a, type, of, agave, to, make, dartboards, small, bundles, of, sisal, fibres, of, the, same, length, were, bundled, together, the, bundles, were, then, compressed, into, a, disk, and, bound, with, a, metal, ring, this, new, dartboard, was, an, instant, success, it, was, more, durable, and, required, little, maintenance, furthermore, darts, did, little, or, no, damage, to, the, board, they, simply, parted, the, packed, fibres, when, they, entered, the, board, the, earliest, darts, were, stubs, of, arrows, or, crossbow, bolts, the, first, purpose, made, darts, were, manufactured, from, solid, wood, wrapped, with, a, strip, of, lead, for, weight, and, fitted, with, flights, made, from, split, turkey, feathers, these, darts, were, mainly, produced, in, france, and, became, known, as, french, darts, metal, barrels, were, patented, in, 1906, but, wood, continued, to, be, used, into, the, 1950s, the, first, metal, barrels, were, made, from, brass, which, was, relatively, cheap, and, easy, to, work, the, wooden, shafts, threaded, to, fit, the, tapped, barrel, were, either, fletched, as, before, or, designed, to, take, a, paper, flight, this, type, of, dart, continued, to, be, used, into, the, 1970s, with, the, widespread, use, of, plastic, the, shaft, and, flight, came, to, be, manufactured, separately, although, one, piece, moulded, plastic, shaft, and, flight, darts, were, also, available, according, to, the, darts, regulation, authority, a, regulation, board, is, 451, mm, 17, 8, in, in, diameter, and, is, divided, into, 20, radial, sections, each, section, is, separated, with, metal, wire, or, a, thin, band, of, sheet, metal, quality, dartboards, are, still, made, of, sisal, fibres, from, eastern, africa, brazil, and, china, less, expensive, boards, are, sometimes, made, of, cork, or, coiled, paper, modern, darts, are, made, up, of, four, components, the, points, the, barrels, the, shafts, and, the, flights, the, points, come, in, two, common, lengths, 32, and, 41, mm, 1, 3, and, 1, 6, in, and, are, sometimes, knurled, or, coated, to, improve, players, grip, others, are, designed, to, retract, slightly, on, impact, to, lessen, the, chance, of, the, dart, bouncing, out, the, barrels, come, in, a, variety, of, weights, and, are, usually, constructed, from, brass, nickel, silver, or, a, tungsten, alloy, brass, is, cheap, but, light, and, therefore, brass, barrels, tend, to, be, very, bulky, tungsten, on, the, other, hand, is, twice, as, dense, as, brass, thus, a, tungsten, barrel, of, equivalent, weight, could, be, thirty, percent, smaller, in, diameter, than, a, brass, one, pure, tungsten, is, very, brittle, however, so, an, alloy, is, commonly, used, with, between, 80, and, 95, percent, tungsten, and, the, remainder, usually, nickel, iron, or, copper, nickel, silver, darts, offer, a, compromise, between, density, and, cost, barrels, come, in, three, basic, shapes, cylindrical, ton, or, torpedo, the, shafts, are, manufactured, in, various, lengths, and, some, are, designed, to, be, cut, to, length, shafts, are, generally, made, from, plastics, nylon, polymers, or, metals, such, as, aluminium, and, titanium, and, can, be, rigid, or, flexible, longer, shafts, provide, greater, stability, and, allow, a, reduction, in, flight, size, which, in, turn, can, lead, to, closer, grouping, but, they, also, shift, the, weight, towards, the, rear, causing, the, dart, to, tilt, backwards, during, flight, requiring, a, harder, faster, throw, the, flight, stabilizes, the, dart, by, producing, drag, thus, preventing, the, rear, of, the, dart, from, overtaking, the, point, modern, flights, are, generally, made, from, plastic, nylon, or, foil, and, are, available, in, a, range, of, shapes, and, sizes, the, three, most, common, shapes, in, order, of, size, are, the, standard, the, kite, and, the, smaller, pear, shape, the, less, surface, area, the, less, stability, but, larger, flights, hamper, close, grouping, some, manufacturers, have, sought, to, solve, this, by, making, a, flight, long, and, thin, but, this, in, turn, creates, other, problems, such, as, changing, the, dart, s, centre, of, gravity, generally, speaking, a, heavier, dart, will, require, a, larger, flight, the, choice, of, barrel, shaft, and, flight, will, depend, a, great, deal, on, the, individual, player, s, throwing, style, for, competitive, purposes, a, dart, cannot, weigh, more, than, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, including, the, shaft, and, flight, and, cannot, exceed, a, total, length, of, 300, mm, 12, in, the, world, darts, federation, uses, the, following, standards, for, play, the, regulations, came, about, owing, to, the, united, kingdom, and, the, rest, of, the, world, playing, at, different, lengths, with, 2, 37, m, 7, ft, 9, in, being, the, compromise, length, the, standard, dartboard, is, divided, into, 20, numbered, sections, scoring, from, 1, to, 20, points, by, wires, running, from, the, small, central, circle, to, the, outer, circular, wire, circular, wires, within, the, outer, wire, subdivide, each, section, into, single, double, and, treble, areas, the, dartboard, featured, on, the, indoor, league, television, show, of, the, 1970s, did, not, feature, a, treble, section, and, according, to, host, fred, trueman, during, the, first, episode, this, is, the, traditional, yorkshire, board, various, games, are, played, using, the, standard, dartboard, however, in, the, official, game, any, dart, landing, inside, the, outer, wire, scores, as, follows, the, highest, score, possible, with, three, darts, is, 180, commonly, known, as, a, ton, 80, 100, points, is, called, a, ton, obtained, when, all, three, darts, land, in, the, triple, 20, in, the, televised, game, the, referee, frequently, announces, a, score, of, 180, in, exuberant, style, once, a, player, reaches, a, low, enough, score, they, are, considered, to, be, on, a, finish, meaning, they, can, win, the, game, leg, with, their, remaining, darts, in, professional, matches, the, match, referee, will, usually, tell, the, player, which, score, they, require, once, on, a, finish, as, the, winning, dart, in, a, game, must, be, a, double, or, bullseye, the, highest, possible, finish, with, three, darts, is, 170, t20, t20, inner, bull, finishes, are, also, known, as, check, outs, regular, players, become, familiar, with, the, combinations, needed, to, check, out, a, particular, number, for, instance, a, player, on, 138, could, hit, t20, t18, d12, most, numbers, can, be, checked, out, with, more, than, one, combination, for, 138, a, player, could, also, hit, t19, t19, d12, good, arithmetic, is, helpful, as, in, the, event, of, missing, a, target, number, players, need, to, quickly, recalculate, their, new, score, and, which, number, they, now, need, to, hit, for, instance, if, a, player, on, 93, t19, d18, hits, single, 19, with, their, first, dart, they, can, still, finish, but, will, now, need, to, check, out, 74, t14, d16, checkout, charts, detailing, which, numbers, are, required, for, each, particular, finish, are, widely, used, in, the, 1990s, a, board, with, a, quad, ring, between, the, triple, ring, and, the, bullseye, appeared, which, gave, quadruple, points, meaning, a, 240, maximum, three, quad, 20s, a, 210, maximum, checkout, q20, q20, bull, and, a, seven, dart, finish, five, quad, 20s, triple, 17, bullseye, were, possible, one, make, of, this, board, was, the, harrows, quadro, 240, the, board, was, used, during, the, short, lived, wdc, uk, matchplay, although, no, seven, dart, finish, was, ever, scored, on, the, board, john, lowe, did, come, close, to, a, 9, dart, finish, in, the, 1993, pdc, uk, matchplay, he, scored, 200, t20, t20, q20, then, 160, 20, t20, q20, and, got, his, final, t20, and, t15, only, to, miss, d18, on, his, final, throw, several, players, did, score, a, 240, maximum, during, the, event, and, phil, taylor, hit, a, 188, checkout, q20, q20, d14, the, tournament, was, discontinued, in, 1996, and, the, board, has, not, been, used, in, a, professional, event, since, assuming, standard, scoring, the, optimal, area, to, aim, for, on, the, dartboard, to, maximize, the, player, s, score, varies, significantly, based, on, the, player, s, skill, the, skilled, player, should, aim, for, the, centre, of, the, t20, and, as, the, player, s, skill, decreases, their, aim, moves, slightly, up, and, to, the, left, of, the, t20, at, 16, 4, mm, the, best, place, to, aim, jumps, to, the, t19, as, the, player, s, skill, decreases, further, the, best, place, to, aim, curls, into, the, centre, of, the, board, stopping, a, bit, lower, than, and, to, the, left, of, the, bullseye, at, 100, mm, many, games, can, be, played, on, a, dartboard, but, the, term, darts, generally, refers, to, a, game, in, which, one, player, at, a, time, throws, three, darts, per, turn, the, throwing, player, must, stand, so, that, no, portion, of, their, feet, extends, past, the, leading, edge, of, the, oche, but, may, stand, on, any, other, portion, and, or, lean, forward, over, it, if, desired, a, game, of, darts, is, generally, contested, between, two, players, who, take, turns, the, most, common, objective, is, to, reduce, a, fixed, score, commonly, 301, or, 501, to, zero, checking, out, with, the, final, dart, landing, in, either, the, bullseye, or, a, double, segment, to, win, not, all, three, darts, need, to, be, thrown, on, the, final, turn, the, game, can, be, finished, on, any, of, the, three, darts, when, two, teams, play, the, starting, score, is, sometimes, increased, to, 701, or, even, 1001, the, rules, remain, the, same, a, throw, that, reduces, a, player, s, score, below, zero, to, exactly, one, or, to, zero, but, not, ending, with, a, double, or, bullseye, is, known, as, going, bust, the, player, s, score, is, reset, to, its, value, at, the, start, of, that, turn, and, any, remaining, throws, in, the, turn, are, forfeited, in, some, variants, a, player, who, busts, has, their, score, reset, to, its, value, before, the, individual, dart, that, caused, the, bust, this, rule, referred, to, as, a, northern, bust, in, london, is, considered, by, some, players, to, be, a, purer, version, of, the, game, under, the, standard, rules, above, a, player, left, with, a, difficult, finish, e, g, 5, and, one, dart, remaining, might, deliberately, bust, in, order, to, revert, to, an, earlier, score, that, would, allow, an, easier, finish, under, northern, bust, rules, though, doing, so, would, leave, them, on, 5, a, darts, match, is, played, over, a, fixed, number, of, games, known, as, legs, a, match, may, be, divided, into, sets, with, each, set, being, contested, as, over, a, fixed, number, of, legs, although, playing, straight, down, from, 501, is, standard, in, darts, sometimes, a, double, must, be, hit, to, begin, scoring, known, as, doubling, in, with, all, darts, thrown, before, hitting, a, double, not, being, counted, the, pdc, s, world, grand, prix, uses, this, format, the, minimum, number, of, thrown, darts, required, to, complete, a, leg, of, 501, is, nine, the, most, common, nine, dart, finish, consists, of, two, 180, maximums, followed, by, a, 141, checkout, t20, t19, d12, but, there, are, many, other, possible, ways, of, achieving, the, feat, three, 167s, t20, t19, bull, is, considered, a, pure, or, perfect, nine, dart, finish, by, some, players, there, are, several, regional, variations, on, the, standard, rules, and, scoring, systems, american, darts, is, a, regional, u, s, variant, of, the, game, most, u, s, dart, players, play, the, traditional, games, described, above, this, style, of, dartboard, is, most, often, found, in, eastern, pennsylvania, new, jersey, delaware, maryland, and, parts, of, new, york, state, beer, darts, is, a, drinking, game, that, involves, throwing, darts, at, opponents, beer, cans, the, resulting, drinking, actions, depend, on, how, and, where, the, beer, can, was, hit, with, the, dart, the, original, name, of, this, sport, was, called, vogelpik, vogelpik, is, the, early, version, of, the, modern, game, of, belgian, darts, belgian, darts, has, remained, a, very, popular, game, in, the, belgian, community, since, the, 18th, century, it, is, not, only, relaxing, but, also, helps, to, develop, coordination, skills, precision, and, self, control, each, player, has, a, set, of, four, darts, four, thrown,

played, darts, game, involving, a, race, to, control, and, score, on, numbers, between, 20, and, 15, and, the, bullseye, by, hitting, each, of, these, targets, for, three, marks, to, open, or, own, it, for, scoring, a, hit, on, the, target, counts, as, one, mark, while, hits, in, the, doubles, ring, of, the, target, count, as, two, marks, in, one, throw, and, on, the, triples, ring, as, three, once, opened, in, this, manner, until, the, opponent, closes, that, number, with, three, marks, on, it, of, their, own, each, additional, hit, by, the, owner, opener, scores, points, equal, to, the, number, of, the, target, which, may, also, be, doubled, and, tripled, e, g, a, triple, 20, is, worth, 60, points, the, outer, bullseye, counts, as, 25, points, and, the, inner, as, 50, dartball, is,

regional, variant, still, played, in, some, parts, of, the, east, end, of, london, the, board, has, fewer, larger, segments, all, numbered, either, 5, 10, 15, or, 20, players, play, down, from, 505, rather, than, 501, and, stand, the, farthest, 2, 7, m, 8, ft, 10, in, away, from, the, board, of, any, mainstream, variation, halve, it, is, a, darts, game, popular, in, the, united, kingdom, and, parts, of, north, america, where, competitors, try, to, hit, previously, agreed, targets, on, a, standard, dart, board, failure, to, do, so, within, a, single, throw, 3, darts, results, in, the, player, losing, half, their, accumulated, score, any, number, of, players, can, take, part, and, the, game, can, vary, in, length, depending, on, the, number, of, targets, selected, the, game, can,

initially, each, player, throws, a, dart, at, the, board, with, their, non, dominant, hand, to, obtain, their, number, no, two, players, can, have, the, same, number, once, everyone, has, a, number, each, player, takes, it, in, turn, to, get, their, number, five, times, with, their, three, darts, doubles, count, twice, and, triples, three, times, once, a, person, has, reached, 5, they, become, a, killer, this, means, they, can, aim, for, other, peoples, numbers, taking, a, point, off, for, each, time, they, hit, doubles, 2, triples, 3, if, a, person, gets, to, zero, they, are, out, a, killer, can, aim, for, anyone, s, numbers, even, another, killer, s, players, cannot, get, more, than, 5, points, the, winner, is, the, last, man, standing, another, version, of, killer, is, a, knock, out, game, for, three, or, more, players, the, more, the, better, to, start, everyone, has, a, pre, determined, number, of, lives, usually, 5, and, a, randomly, chosen, player, throws, a, single, dart, at, the, board, to, set, a, target, i, e, single, 18, and, does, not, play, until, that, target, is, hit, the, next, player, up, has, 3, darts, to, try, and, hit, the, target, single, 18, if, they, fail, they, lose, a, life, and, the, following, player, tries, once, a, player, succeeds, at, hitting, the, target, they, then, become, the, target, setter, and, throw, a, dart, to, set, a, new, target, the, initial, target, setter, swaps, places, with, the, new, target, setter, the, games, carry, on, until, every, players, lives, have, been, used, the, last, man, standing, is, the, target, setter, whose, target, was, not, hit, for, less, experienced, players, doubles, and, trebles, as, part, of, the, same, number, can, be, counted, i, e, a, target, of, treble, 20, can, still, be, counted, as, a, success, if, the, double, or, single, 20, is, hit, and, vice, versa, lawn, darts, also, called, yard, darts, and, garden, darts, is, an, outdoor, game, with, gameplay, and, objective, similar, to,

the, winner, is, the, person, who, has, the, most, points, at, the, end, of, seven, rounds, 1, 7, or, who, scores, a, shanghai, which, wins, instantly, a, shanghai, being, throws, that, hit, a, triple, a, double, and, single, in, any, order, of, the, number, that, is, in, play, shanghai, can, also, be, played, for, 20, rounds, to, use, all, numbers, a, fairer, start, for, shanghai, to, prevent, players, from, becoming, too, practised, at, shooting, for, the, 1, the, number, sequence, can, begin, at, the, number, of, the, dart, that, lost, the, throw, for, the, bullseye, to, determine, the, starting, thrower, for, example, thrower, a, shoots, for, the, bullseye, and, hits, the, 17, thrower, b, shoots, for, the, bullseye, and, hits, it, thrower, b, then, begins, the, game, starting, on, the, number, 17, then, 18, 19, 20, 1, 2, 3, etc, through, 16, if, no, player, hits, shanghai, shanghai, is, one, of, the, disciplines, in, the, british, pentathlon, tournament, the, game, is, played, across, a, pitch, consisting, of, the, top, and, bottom, three, segments, ideally, on, a, wide, 5, s, dartboard, players, can, move, only, one, square, at, a, time, including, those, diagonally, the, central, square, ring, bull, representing, midfield, as, well, as, those, of, the, triple, area, representing, the, opponent, s, defensive, wall, or, the, 22, m, line, so, as, to, finally, attain, a, square, of, the, opponent, s, double, section, the, try, scoring, area, its, central, square, representing, the, opponent, s, goal, i, e, for, points, scored, between, the, posts, during, the, game, players, seek, to, regather, possession, by, hitting, the, last, square, occupied, by, their, opponent, the, player, via, a, single, throw, looks, to, send, the, ball, deep, into, the, opponent, s, half, whom, then, tries, to, gather, it, by, hitting, the, very, same, square, is, conceded, by, a, player, having, hit, a, neighbouring, square, and, adjacent, to, the, pitch,
