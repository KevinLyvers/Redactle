the, high, jump, is, a, track, and, field, event, in, which, competitors, must, jump, unaided, over, a, horizontal, bar, placed, at, measured, heights, without, dislodging, it, in, its, modern, most, practiced, format, a, bar, is, placed, between, two, standards, with, a, crash, mat, for, landing, since, ancient, times, competitors, have, successively, improved, their, technique, until, developing, the, universally, preferred, fosbury, flop, in, which, athletes, run, towards, the, bar, and, leap, head, first, with, their, back, to, the, bar, the, discipline, is, alongside, the, pole, vault, one, of, two, vertical, clearance, events, in, the, olympic, athletics, program, it, is, contested, at, the, world, championships, in, athletics, and, the, world, athletics, indoor, championships, and, is, a, common, occurrence, at, track, and, field, meets, the, high, jump, was, among, the, first, events, deemed, acceptable, for, women, having, been, held, at, the, 1928, olympic, games, javier, sotomayor, cuba, is, the, world, record, holder, with, a, jump, of, 2, 45, m, 8, ft, 1, 4, in, set, in, 1993, the, longest, standing, record, in, the, history, of, the, men, s, high, jump, yaroslava, mahuchikh, ukraine, is, the, women, s, world, record, holder, with, a, jump, of, 2, 10, m, 6, ft, 10, 1, 2, in, set, in, 2024, the, rules, set, for, the, high, jump, by, world, athletics, previously, named, the, iaaf, are, technical, rules, tr26, and, tr27, previously, rules, 181, and, 182, jumpers, must, take, off, from, one, foot, a, jump, is, considered, a, failure, if, the, jumper, dislodges, the, bar, or, touches, the, ground, or, any, object, behind, the, bar, before, clearance, competitors, may, begin, jumping, at, any, height, announced, by, the, chief, judge, or, may, pass, at, their, own, discretion, most, competitions, state, that, three, consecutive, missed, jumps, at, any, height, or, combination, of, heights, will, eliminate, the, jumper, from, contention, the, victory, goes, to, the, jumper, who, clears, the, greatest, height, during, the, final, if, two, or, more, jumpers, tie, for, any, place, the, tie, breakers, are, 1, the, fewest, misses, at, the, height, at, which, the, tie, occurred, and, 2, the, fewest, misses, throughout, the, competition, if, the, event, remains, tied, for, first, place, or, a, limited, advancement, position, to, a, subsequent, meet, the, jumpers, have, a, jump, off, beginning, at, the, next, height, above, their, highest, success, jumpers, have, one, attempt, at, each, height, if, only, one, succeeds, he, or, she, wins, if, more, than, one, does, these, try, with, the, bar, raised, if, none, does, all, try, with, the, bar, lowered, this, process, was, followed, at, the, 2015, world, championship, men, s, event, and, at, the, 2024, summer, olympics, example, in, the, example, jump, off, the, final, cleared, height, is, 1, 88m, at, which, a, b, c, and, d, each, have, one, failure, d, has, two, failures, at, lower, heights, compared, to, one, each, for, the, other, three, who, proceed, to, a, jump, off, at, the, next, height, above, the, final, cleared, height, c, is, eliminated, in, the, second, round, of, the, jump, off, 1, 89m, then, b, wins, in, the, third, round, a, 2009, rule, change, makes, the, jump, off, optional, so, that, first, place, can, be, shared, by, agreement, among, tied, athletes, this, rule, led, to, shared, gold, in, the, 2020, olympic, men, s, event, held, in, 2021, the, first, recorded, high, jump, event, took, place, in, scotland, in, the, 19th, century, early, jumpers, used, either, an, elaborate, straight, on, approach, or, a, scissors, technique, in, later, years, the, bar, was, approached, diagonally, and, the, jumper, threw, first, the, inside, leg, and, then, the, other, over, the, bar, in, a, scissoring, motion, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, techniques, began, to, change, beginning, with, the, irish, american, michael, sweeney, s, eastern, cut, off, as, a, variation, of, the, scissors, technique, by, taking, off, as, in, the, scissors, method, extending, his, spine, and, flattening, out, over, the, bar, sweeney, raised, the, world, record, to, 1, 97, m, 6, ft, 5, 1, 2, in, in, 1895, even, in, 1948, john, winter, of, australia, won, the, gold, medal, of, the, 1948, london, olympics, with, this, style, besides, one, of, the, most, successful, female, high, jumpers, iolanda, bala, of, romania, used, this, style, to, dominate, women, s, high, jump, for, about, 10, years, until, her, retirement, in, 1967, another, american, george, horine, developed, an, even, more, efficient, technique, the, western, roll, in, this, style, the, bar, again, is, approached, on, a, diagonal, but, the, inner, leg, is, used, for, the, take, off, while, the, outer, leg, is, thrust, up, to, lead, the, body, sideways, over, the, bar, horine, increased, the, world, standard, to, 2, 01, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, 1912, his, technique, was, predominant, through, the, 1936, berlin, olympics, in, which, the, event, was, won, by, cornelius, johnson, at, 2, 03, m, 6, ft, 7, 3, 4, in, american, and, soviet, jumpers, were, the, most, successful, for, the, next, four, decades, and, they, pioneered, the, straddle, technique, straddle, jumpers, took, off, as, in, the, western, roll, but, rotated, their, torso, belly, down, around, the, bar, obtaining, the, most, efficient, and, highest, clearance, up, to, that, time, straddle, jumper, charles, dumas, was, the, first, to, clear, 7, ft, 2, 13m, in, 1956, american, john, thomas, pushed, the, world, mark, to, 2, 23, m, 7, ft, 3, 3, 4, in, in, 1960, valeriy, brumel, of, the, soviet, union, took, over, the, event, for, the, next, four, years, radically, speeding, up, his, approach, run, he, took, the, record, up, to, 2, 28, m, 7, ft, 5, 3, 4, in, and, won, the, gold, medal, of, the, 1964, tokyo, olympics, before, a, motorcycle, accident, ended, his, career, in, 1965, american, coaches, including, two, time, ncaa, champion, frank, costello, of, the, university, of, maryland, flocked, to, russia, to, learn, from, brumel, and, his, coaches, like, vladimir, dyachkov, however, it, would, be, a, solitary, innovator, at, oregon, state, university, dick, fosbury, who, would, bring, the, high, jump, into, the, next, century, taking, advantage, of, the, raised, softer, artificially, cushioned, landing, areas, that, were, in, use, by, then, fosbury, added, a, new, twist, to, the, outmoded, eastern, cut, off, he, directed, himself, over, the, bar, head, and, shoulders, first, going, over, on, his, back, and, landing, in, a, fashion, that, would, likely, have, resulted, in, serious, injury, in, the, old, ground, level, landing, pits, which, were, usually, filled, with, sawdust, or, sand, mixtures, around, the, same, time, debbie, brill, independently, came, up, with, the, same, technique, which, she, called, the, brill, bend, since, fosbury, used, his, new, style, called, the, fosbury, flop, to, win, the, gold, medal, of, the, 1968, mexico, olympics, its, use, spread, quickly, and, soon, floppers, were, dominating, international, high, jump, competitions, the, first, flopper, setting, a, world, record, was, the, american, dwight, stones, who, cleared, 2, 30, m, 7, ft, 6, 1, 2, in, in, 1973, in, the, female, side, the, 16, year, old, flopper, ulrike, meyfarth, from, west, germany, won, the, gold, medal, of, the, 1972, munich, olympics, at, 1, 92, m, 6, ft, 3, 1, 2, in, which, tied, the, women, s, world, record, at, that, time, held, by, the, austrian, straddler, ilona, gusenbauer, a, year, before, however, it, was, not, until, 1978, when, a, flopper, sara, simeoni, of, italy, broke, the, women, s, world, record, successful, high, jumpers, following, fosbury, s, lead, also, included, the, rival, of, dwight, stones, 1, 73, metres, 5, ft, 8, in, tall, franklin, jacobs, of, paterson, new, jersey, who, cleared, 2, 32, m, 7, ft, 7, 1, 4, in, 0, 59, metres, 1, ft, 11, in, over, his, head, a, feat, equalled, 27, years, later, by, stefan, holm, of, sweden, chinese, record, setters, ni, chi, chin, and, zhu, jianhua, germans, gerd, wessig, and, dietmar, m, genburg, swedish, olympic, medalist, and, former, world, record, holder, patrik, sj, berg, female, jumpers, ulrike, meyfarth, of, west, germany, and, sara, simeoni, of, italy, in, spite, of, this, the, straddle, technique, did, not, disappear, at, once, in, 1977, the, 18, year, old, soviet, straddler, vladimir, yashchenko, set, a, new, world, record, 2, 33, m, 7, ft, 7, 1, 2, in, in, 1978, he, raised, the, record, to, 2, 34, m, 7, ft, 8, in, and, 2, 35, m, 7, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, indoor, just, before, a, knee, injury, effectively, ended, his, career, when, he, was, only, 20, years, old, in, the, female, side, the, straddler, rosemarie, ackermann, of, east, germany, who, was, the, first, female, jumper, ever, to, clear, 2, m, 6, ft, 6, 1, 2, in, raised, the, world, record, from, 1, 95, m, 6, ft, 4, 3, 4, in, to, 2, 00, m, 6, ft, 6, 1, 2, in, during, 1974, to, 1977, in, fact, from, 2, june, 1977, to, 3, august, 1978, almost, 10, years, after, fosbury, s, success, the, men, s, and, women, s, world, records, were, still, held, by, straddle, jumpers, yashchenko, and, ackermann, respectively, however, they, were, the, last, world, record, holders, using, the, straddle, technique, ackermann, also, won, the, gold, medal, of, the, 1976, montreal, olympics, which, was, the, last, time, for, a, straddle, jumper, male, or, female, to, win, an, olympic, medal, in, 1980, the, polish, flopper, 1976, olympic, gold, medalist, jacek, wszo, a, broke, yashchenko, s, world, record, at, 2, 35, m, 7, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, two, years, before, the, female, italian, flopper, sara, simeoni, the, long, term, rival, of, ackermann, broke, ackermann, s, world, record, at, 2, 01, m, 6, ft, 7, in, and, became, the, first, female, flopper, to, break, the, women, s, world, record, she, also, won, the, gold, medal, of, the, 1980, moscow, olympics, where, ackermann, placed, fourth, since, then, the, flop, style, has, been, completely, dominant, all, other, techniques, were, almost, extinct, in, serious, high, jump, competitions, after, late, 1980s, technique, and, form, have, evolved, greatly, over, the, history, of, high, jump, the, fosbury, flop, is, considered, the, most, efficient, way, for, competitors, to, propel, themselves, over, the, bar, for, a, fosbury, flop, depending, on, the, athlete, s, jump, foot, they, start, on, the, right, or, left, of, the, high, jump, mat, placing, their, jump, foot, farthest, away, from, the, mat, they, take, an, eight, to, ten, step, approach, with, the, first, three, to, five, steps, being, in, a, straight, line, and, the, last, five, being, on, a, curve, athletes, generally, mark, their, approach, in, order, to, find, as, much, consistency, as, possible, the, approach, run, can, be, more, important, than, the, takeoff, if, a, high, jumper, runs, with, bad, timing, or, without, enough, aggression, clearing, the, bar, becomes, more, of, a, challenge, the, approach, requires, a, certain, shape, or, curve, the, right, amount, of, speed, and, the, correct, number, of, strides, the, approach, angle, is, also, critical, for, optimal, height, the, straight, run, builds, the, momentum, and, sets, the, tone, for, a, jump, the, athlete, starts, by, pushing, off, their, takeoff, foot, with, slow, powerful, steps, then, begins, to, accelerate, they, should, be, running, upright, by, the, end, of, the, straight, portion, the, athlete, s, takeoff, foot, will, be, landing, on, the, first, step, of, the, curve, and, they, will, continue, to, accelerate, focusing, their, body, towards, the, opposite, back, corner, of, the, high, jump, mat, while, staying, erect, and, leaning, away, from, the, mat, the, athlete, takes, their, final, two, steps, flat, footed, rolling, from, the, heel, to, the, toe, most, great, straddle, jumpers, run, at, angles, of, about, 30, to, 40, degrees, the, length, of, the, run, is, determined, by, the, speed, of, the, approach, a, slower, run, requires, about, eight, strides, but, a, faster, high, jumper, might, need, about, 13, strides, greater, speed, allows, a, greater, part, of, the, body, s, forward, momentum, to, be, converted, upward, the, j, approach, favored, by, fosbury, floppers, allows, for, speed, the, ability, to, turn, in, the, air, centripetal, force, and, a, good, takeoff, position, which, helps, turn, horizontal, momentum, into, vertical, momentum, the, approach, should, be, a, hard, controlled, stride, so, that, the, athlete, does, not, fall, from, running, at, an, angle, athletes, should, lean, into, the, curve, from, their, ankles, not, their, hips, this, allows, their, hips, to, rotate, during, takeoff, which, in, turn, allows, their, center, of, gravity, to, pass, under, the, bar, the, takeoff, can, be, double, arm, or, single, arm, in, both, cases, the, plant, foot, should, be, the, foot, farthest, from, the, bar, angled, towards, the, opposite, back, corner, of, the, mat, as, they, drive, up, the, knee, on, their, non, takeoff, leg, this, is, accompanied, by, a, one, or, two, arm, swing, while, driving, the, knee, unlike, the, straddle, technique, where, the, takeoff, foot, is, planted, in, the, same, spot, regardless, of, the, height, of, the, bar, flop, style, jumpers, must, adjust, their, approach, run, as, the, bar, is, raised, so, that, their, takeoff, spot, is, slightly, farther, out, from, the, bar, jumpers, attempting, to, reach, record, heights, commonly, fail, when, most, of, their, energy, is, directed, into, the, vertical, effort, and, they, knock, the, bar, off, the, standards, with, the, backs, of, their, legs, as, they, stall, an, effective, approach, shape, can, be, derived, from, physics, for, example, the, rate, of, backward, spin, required, as, the, jumper, crosses, the, bar, in, order, to, facilitate, shoulder, clearance, on, the, way, up, and, foot, clearance, on, the, way, down, can, be, determined, by, computer, simulation, this, rotation, rate, can, be, back, calculated, to, determine, the, required, angle, of, lean, away, from, the, bar, at, the, moment, of, planting, based, on, how, long, the, jumper, is, on, the, takeoff, foot, this, information, together, with, the, jumper, s, speed, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, radius, of, the, curved, part, of, the, approach, one, can, also, work, in, the, opposite, direction, by, assuming, a, certain, approach, radius, and, determining, the, resulting, backward, rotation, drills, can, be, practiced, to, solidify, the, approach, one, drill, is, to, run, in, a, straight, line, and, then, run, two, to, three, circles, spiraling, into, one, another, another, is, to, run, or, skip, a, circle, of, any, size, two, to, three, times, in, a, row, it, is, important, to, leap, upwards, without, first, leaning, into, the, bar, allowing, the, momentum, of, the, j, approach, to, carry, the, body, across, the, bar, the, knee, on, the, athlete, s, non, takeoff, leg, naturally, turns, their, body, placing, them, in, the, air, with, their, back, to, the, bar, the, athlete, then, drives, their, shoulders, towards, the, back, of, their, feet, arching, their, body, over, the, bar, they, can, look, over, their, shoulder, to, judge, when, to, kick, both, feet, over, their, head, causing, their, body, to, clear, the, bar, and, land, on, the, mat, the, following, athletes, have, had, their, personal, best, annulled, due, to, doping, offences, the, following, athletes, have, had, their, personal, best, annulled, due, to, doping, offences, athletes, who, have, won, multiple, titles, at, the, two, most, important, competitions, the, olympic, games, and, the, world, championships, kostadinova, sotomayor, and, mahuchikh, are, the, only, high, jumpers, to, have, been, olympic, champion, world, champion, and, broken, the, world, record
