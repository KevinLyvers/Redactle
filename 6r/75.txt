products, mcdonald, s, big, mac, and, burger, king, s, whopper, have, become, global, icons, of, american, culture, the, term, hamburger, originally, derives, from, hamburg, the, second, largest, city, in, germany, however, there, is, no, certain, connection, between, the, food, and, the, city, by, linguistic, rebracketing, the, term, burger, eventually, became, a, self, standing, word, that, is, associated, with, many, different, types, of, sandwiches, that, are, similar, to, a, hamburger, but, contain, different, meats, such, as, buffalo, in, the, buffalo, burger, venison, kangaroo,

beef, burger, turkey, burger, bison, burger, portobello, burger, or, veggie, burger, in, most, english, speaking, countries, including, the, united, kingdom, ireland, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, a, piece, of, chicken, breast, in, a, bun, is, a, chicken, burger, americans, would, call, this, a, chicken, sandwich, because, the, meat, is, not, ground, whereas, in, other, countries, anything, with, a, bun, is, considered, a, burger, and, a, sandwich, has, sliced, bread, versions, of, the, meal, have, been, served, for, over, a, century, but, its, origins, remain, obscure, the, 1758, edition, of, the, book, the, art, of, cookery, made, plain, and, easy, by, hannah, glasse, included, a, recipe, called, hamburgh, sausage, suggesting, that, it, should, be, served, roasted, with, toasted, bread, under, it, a, similar, snack, was, also, popular, in, hamburg, under, the, name, of, rundst, ck, warm, bread, roll, warm, in, 1869, or, earlier, and, was, supposedly, eaten, by, emigrants, on, their, way, to, america, however, this, may, have, contained, roasted, beefsteak, rather, than, frikadelle, it, has, alternatively, been, suggested, that, hamburg, steak, served, between, two, pieces, of, bread, and, eaten, by, jewish, passengers, travelling, from, hamburg, to, new, york, on, hamburg, america, line, vessels, which, began, operations, in, 1847, became, so, well, known, that, the, shipping, company, gave, its, name, to, the, dish, it, is, not, known, which, of, these, stories, actually, marks, the, invention, of, the, hamburger, and, explains, the, name, there, is, a, reference, to, a, hamburg, steak, as, early, as, 1884, in, the, boston, journal, on, july, 5, 1896, the, chicago, daily, tribune, made, a, highly, specific, claim, regarding, a, hamburger, sandwich, in, an, article, about, a, sandwich, car, a, distinguished, favorite, only, five, cents, is, hamburger, steak, sandwich, the, meat, for, which, is, kept, ready, in, small, patties, and, cooked, while, you, wait, on, the, gasoline, range, the, origin, of, the, hamburger, is, unclear, though, hamburger, steak, sandwiches, have, been, advertised, in, u, s, newspapers, from, new, york, to, hawaii, since, at, least, the, 1890s, the, invention, of, hamburgers, is, commonly, attributed, to, various, people, including, charlie, nagreen, frank, and, charles, menches, oscar, weber, bilby, fletcher, davis, or, louis, lassen, white, castle, traces, the, origin, of, the, hamburger, to, hamburg, germany, with, its, invention, by, otto, krause, some, have, pointed, to, a, recipe, for, hamburgh, sausages, on, toasted, bread, published, in, the, art, of, cookery, made, plain, and, easy, by, hannah, glasse, in, 1758, hamburgers, gained, national, recognition, in, the, u, s, at, the, 1904, st, louis, world, s, fair, when, the, new, york, tribune, referred, to, the, hamburger, as, the, innovation, of, a, food, vendor, on, the, pike, no, conclusive, argument, has, ended, the, dispute, over, invention, an, article, from, abc, news, sums, up, one, problem, is, that, there, is, little, written, history, another, issue, is, that, the, spread, of, the, burger, happened, largely, at, the, world, s, fair, from, tiny, vendors, that, came, and, went, in, an, instant, and, it, is, entirely, possible, that, more, than, one, person, came, up, with, the, idea, at, the, same, time, in, different, parts, of, the, country, although, debunked, by, the, washington, post, a, popular, myth, recorded, by, connecticut, congresswoman, rosa, delauro, stated, the, first, hamburger, served, in, america, was, by, louis, lassen, a, danish, immigrant, after, he, opened, louis, lunch, in, new, haven, in, 1895, louis, lunch, a, small, lunch, wagon, in, new, haven, connecticut, is, said, to, have, sold, the, first, hamburger, and, steak, sandwich, in, the, u, s, in, 1900, new, york, magazine, states, that, the, dish, actually, had, no, name, until, some, rowdy, sailors, from, hamburg, named, the, meat, on, a, bun, after, themselves, years, later, also, noting, that, this, claim, is, subject, to, dispute, a, customer, ordered, a, quick, hot, meal, and, louis, was, out, of, steaks, taking, ground, beef, trimmings, louis, made, a, patty, and, grilled, it, putting, it, between, two, slices, of, toast, some, critics, such, as, josh, ozersky, a, food, editor, for, new, york, magazine, claim, that, this, sandwich, was, not, a, hamburger, because, the, bread, was, toasted, one, of, the, earliest, claims, comes, from, charlie, nagreen, who, in, 1885, sold, a, meatball, between, two, slices, of, bread, at, the, seymour, fair, now, sometimes, called, the, outagamie, county, fair, the, seymour, community, historical, society, of, seymour, wisconsin, credits,
