of, post, modern, furniture, design, is, a, return, to, natural, shapes, and, textures, the, english, word, furniture, is, derived, from, the, french, word, fourniture, the, noun, form, of, fournir, which, means, to, supply, or, provide, thus, fourniture, in, french, means, supplies, or, provisions, the, english, usage, referring, specifically, to, household, objects, is, specific, to, that, language, french, and, other, romance, languages, as, well, as, german, use, variants, of, the, word, meubles, which, derives, from, latin, mobilia, meaning, moveable, goods, the, practice, of, using,

russia, which, depicts, the, goddess, in, a, sitting, position, on, a, throne, a, similar, statue, of, a, seated, woman, was, found, in, atalh, y, k, in, turkey, dating, to, between, 6000, and, 5500, bce, the, inclusion, of, such, a, seat, in, the, figurines, implies, that, these, were, already, common, artefacts, of, that, age, a, range, of, unique, stone, furniture, has, been, excavated, in, skara, brae, a, neolithic, village, in, orkney, scotland, the, site, dates, from, 3100, to, 2500, bce, and, due, to, a, shortage, of, wood, in, orkney, the, people, of, skara, brae, were, forced, to, build, with, stone, a, readily, available, material, that, could, be, worked, easily, and, turned, into, items, for, use, within, the, household, each, house, shows, a, high, degree, of, sophistication, and, was, equipped, with, an, extensive, assortment, of, stone, furniture, ranging, from, cupboards, dressers, and, beds, to, shelves, stone, seats, and, limpet, tanks, the, stone, dresser, was, regarded, as, the, most, important, as, it, symbolically, faces, the, entrance, in, each, house, and, is, therefore, the, first, item, seen, when, entering, perhaps, displaying, symbolic, objects, including, decorative, artwork, such, as, several, neolithic, carved, stone, balls, also, found, at, the, site, ancient, furniture, has, been, excavated, from, the, 8th, century, bce, phrygian, tumulus, the, midas, mound, in, gordion, turkey, pieces, found, here, include, tables, and, inlaid, serving, stands, there, are, also, surviving, works, from, the, 9th, 8th, century, bce, assyrian, palace, of, nimrud, the, earliest, surviving, carpet, the, pazyryk, carpet, was, discovered, in, a, frozen, tomb, in, siberia, and, has, been, dated, between, the, 6th, and, 3rd, century, bce, civilization, in, ancient, egypt, began, with, the, clearance, and, irrigation, of, land, along, the, banks, of, the, river, nile, which, began, in, about, 6000, bce, by, that, time, society, in, the, nile, valley, was, already, engaged, in, organized, agriculture, and, the, construction, of, large, buildings, at, this, period, egyptians, in, the, southwestern, corner, of, egypt, were, herding, cattle, and, also, constructing, large, buildings, mortar, was, in, use, by, around, 4000, bce, the, inhabitants, of, the, nile, valley, and, delta, were, self, sufficient, and, were, raising, barley, and, emmer, an, early, variety, of, wheat, and, stored, it, in, pits, lined, with, reed, mats, they, raised, cattle, goats, and, pigs, and, they, wove, linens, and, baskets, evidence, of, furniture, from, the, predynastic, period, is, scarce, but, samples, from, first, dynasty, tombs, indicate, an, already, advanced, use, of, furnishings, in, the, houses, of, the, age, during, the,

but, other, materials, were, sometimes, used, such, as, leather, and, pieces, were, often, adorned, with, gold, silver, ivory, and, ebony, for, decoration, wood, found, in, egypt, was, not, suitable, for, furniture, construction, so, it, had, to, be, imported, into, the, country, from, other, places, particularly, phoenicia, the, scarcity, of, wood, necessitated, innovation, in, construction, techniques, the, use, of, scarf, joints, to, join, two, shorter, pieces, together, and, form, a, longer, beam, was, one, example, of, this, as, well, as, construction, of, veneers, in, which, low, quality, cheap, wood, was, used, as, the, main, building, material, with, a, thin, layer, of, expensive, wood, on, the, surface, the, earliest, used, seating, furniture, in, the, dynastic, period, was, the, stool, which, was, used, throughout, egyptian, society, from, the, royal, family, down, to, ordinary, citizens, various, different, designs, were, used, including, stools, with, four, vertical, legs, and, others, with, crossed, splayed, legs, almost, all, had, rectangular, seats, however, examples, include, the, workman, s, stool, a, simple, three, legged, structure, with, a, concave, seat, designed, for, comfort, during, labour, and, the, much, more, ornate, folding, stool, with, crossed, folding, legs, which, were, decorated, with, carved, duck, heads, and, ivory, and, had, hinges, made, of, bronze, full, chairs, were, much, rarer, in, early, egypt, being, limited, to, only, wealthy, and, high, ranking, people, and, seen, as, a, status, symbol, they, did, not, reach, ordinary, households, until, the, 18th, dynasty, early, examples, were, formed, by, adding, a, straight, back, to, a, stool, while, later, chairs, had, an, inclined, back, other, furniture, types, in, ancient, egypt, include, tables, which, are, heavily, represented, in, art, but, almost, nonexistent, as, preserved, items, perhaps, because, they, were, placed, outside, tombs, rather, than, within, as, well, as, beds, and, storage, chests, historical, knowledge, of, greek, furniture, is, derived, from, various, sources, including, literature, terracotta, sculptures, statuettes, and, painted, vases, some, pieces, survive, to, this, day, primarily, those, constructed, from, metals, including, bronze, or, marble, wood, was, an, important, and, common, material, in, greek, furniture, both, domestic, and, imported, a, common, technique, was, to, construct, the, main, sections, of, the, furniture, with, cheap, solid, wood, then, apply, a, veneer, using, an, expensive, wood, such, as, maple, or, ebony, greek, furniture, construction, also, made, use, of, dowels, and, tenons, for, joining, the, wooden, parts, of, a, piece, together, wood, was, shaped, by, carving, steam, treatment, and, the, lathe, and, furniture, is, known, to, have, been, decorated, with, ivory, tortoise, shell, glass, gold, or, other, precious, materials, the, modern, word, throne, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, thronos, greek, singular, which, was, a, seat, designated, for, deities, or, individuals, of, high, status, hierarchy, or, honor, the, colossal, chryselephantine, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, constructed, by, phidias, and, lost, in, antiquity, featured, the, god, zeus, seated, on, an, elaborate, throne, which, was, decorated, with, gold, precious, stones, ebony, and, ivory, according, to, pausanias, other, greek, seats, included, the, klismos, an, elegant, greek, chair, with, a, curved, backrest, and, legs, whose, form, was, copied, by, the, romans, and, is, now, part, of, the, vocabulary, of, furniture, design, the, backless, stool, diphros, which, existed, in, most, greek, homes, and, folding, stool, the, kline, used, from, the, late, seventh, century, bce, was, a, multipurpose, piece, used, as, a, bed, but, also, as, a, sofa, and, for, reclining, during, meals, it, was, rectangular, and, supported, on, four, legs, two, of, which, could, be, longer, than, the, other, providing, support, for, an, armrest, or, headboard, mattresses, rugs, and, blankets, may, have, been, used, but, there, is, no, evidence, for, sheets, in, general, greek, tables, were, low, and, often, appear, in, depictions, alongside, klinai, the, most, common, type, of, greek, table, had, a, rectangular, top, supported, on, three, legs, although, numerous, configurations, exist, including, trapezoid, and, circular, tables, in, ancient, greece, were, used, mostly, for, dining, purposes, in, depictions, of, banquets, it, appears, as, though, each, participant, would, have, used, a, single, table, rather, than, a, collective, use, of, a, larger, piece, tables, also, figured, prominently, in, religious, contexts, as, indicated, in, vase, paintings, for, example, the, wine, vessel, associated, with, dionysus, dating, to, around, 450, bce, and, now, housed, at, the, art, institute, of, chicago, chests, were, used, for, storage, of, clothes, and, personal, items, and, were, usually, rectangular, with, hinged, lids, chests, depicted, in, terracotta, show, elaborate, patterns, and, design, including, the, greek, fret, roman, furniture, was, based, heavily, on, greek, furniture, in, style, and, construction, rome, gradually, superseded, greece, as, the, foremost, culture, of, europe, leading, eventually, to, greece, becoming, a, province, of, rome, in, 146, bc, rome, thus, took, over, production, and, distribution, of, greek, furniture, and, the, boundary, between, the, two, is, blurred, the, romans, did, have, some, limited, innovation, outside, of, greek, influence, and, styles, distinctly, their, own, roman, furniture, was, constructed, principally, using, wood, metal, and, stone, with, marble, and, limestone, used, for, outside, furniture, very, little, wooden, furniture, survives, intact, but, there, is, evidence, that, a, variety, of, woods, were, used, including, maple, citron, beech, oak, and, holly, some, imported, wood, such, as, satinwood, was, used, for, decoration, the, most, commonly, used, metal, was, bronze, of, which, numerous, examples, have, survived, for, example, headrests, for, couches, and, metal, stools, similar, to, the, greeks, romans, used, tenons, dowels, nails, and, glue, to, join, wooden, pieces, together, and, also, practised, veneering, the, 1738, and, 1748, excavations, of, herculaneum, and, pompeii, revealed, roman, furniture, preserved, in, the, ashes, of, the, ad, 79, eruption, of, vesuvius, in, contrast, to, the, ancient, civilizations, of, egypt, greece, and, rome, there, is, comparatively, little, evidence, of, furniture, from, the, 5th, to, the, 15th, century, very, few, extant, pieces, survive, and, evidence, in, literature, is, also, scarce, it, is, likely, that, the, style, of, furniture, prevalent, in, late, antiquity, persisted, throughout, the, middle, ages, for, example, a, throne, similar, to, that, of, zeus, is, depicted, in, a, sixth, century, diptych, while, the, bayeux, tapestry, shows, edward, the, confessor, and, harold, seated, on, seats, similar, to, the, roman, sella, curulis, the, furniture, of, the, middle, ages, was, usually, heavy, oak, and, ornamented, with, carved, designs, the, hellenistic, influence, upon, byzantine, furniture, can, be, seen, through, the, use, of, acanthus, leaves, palmettes, bay, and, olive, leaves, as, ornaments, oriental, influences, manifest, through, rosettes, arabesques, and, the, geometric, stylisation, of, certain, vegetal, motifs, christianity, brings,
