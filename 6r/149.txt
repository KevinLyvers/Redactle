gin, d, n, is, a, distilled, alcoholic, drink, flavoured, with, juniper, berries, and, other, botanical, ingredients, gin, originated, as, a, medicinal, liquor, made, by, monks, and, alchemists, across, europe, the, modern, gin, was, modified, in, flanders, and, the, netherlands, to, provide, aqua, vita, from, distillates, of, grapes, and, grains, becoming, an, object, of, commerce, in, the, spirits, industry, gin, became, popular, in, england, after, the, introduction, of, jenever, a, dutch, and, belgian, liquor, although, this, development, had, been, taking, place, since, the, early, 17th, century, gin, became, widespread, after, the, 1688, glorious, revolution, led, by, william, of, orange, and, subsequent, import, restrictions, on, french, brandy, gin, emerged, as, the, national, alcoholic, drink, of, england, during, the, so, called, gin, craze, of, 1695, 1735, gin, is, produced, from, a, wide, range, of, herbal, ingredients, in, a, number, of, distinct, styles, and, brands, after, juniper, gin, tends, to, be, flavoured, with, herbs, spices, floral, or, fruit, flavours, or, often, a, combination, it, is, commonly, mixed, with, tonic, water, in, a, gin, and, tonic, gin, is, also, used, as, a, base, spirit, to, produce, flavoured, gin, based, liqueurs, for, example, sloe, gin, traditionally, produced, by, the, addition, of, fruit, flavourings, and, sugar, the, name, gin, is, a, shortened, form, of, the, older, english, word, genever, related, to, the, french, word, geni, vre, and, the, dutch, word, jenever, all, ultimately, derive, from, juniperus, the, latin, for, juniper, the, earliest, known, written, reference, to, jenever, appears, in, the, 13th, century, encyclopaedic, work, der, naturen, bloeme, bruges, with, the, earliest, printed, recipe, for, jenever, dating, from, 16th, century, work, een, constelijck, distileerboec, antwerp, the, monks, used, it, to, distill, sharp, fiery, alcoholic, tonics, one, of, which, was, distilled, from, wine, infused, with, juniper, berries, they, were, making, medicines, hence, the, juniper, as, a, medicinal, herb, juniper, had, been, an, essential, part, of, doctors, kits, for, centuries, the, romans, burned, juniper, branches, for, purification, and, plague, doctors, stuffed, the, beaks, of, their, plague, masks, with, juniper, to, supposedly, protect, them, from, the, black, death, across, europe, apothecaries, handed, out, juniper, tonic, wines, for, coughs, colds, pains, strains, ruptures, and, cramps, these, were, a, popular, cure, all, though, some, thought, these, tonic, wines, to, be, a, little, too, popular, and, consumed, for, enjoyment, rather, than, medicinal, purposes, the, physician, franciscus, sylvius, has, been, falsely, credited, with, the, invention, of, gin, in, the, mid, 17th, century, as, the, existence, of, jenever, is, confirmed, in, philip, massinger, s, play, the, duke, of, milan, 1623, when, sylvius, would, have, been, about, nine, years, old, it, is, further, claimed, that, english, soldiers, who, provided, support, in, antwerp, against, the, spanish, in, 1585, during, the, eighty, years, war, were, already, drinking, jenever, for, its, calming, effects, before, battle, from, which, the, term, dutch, courage, is, believed, to, have, originated, by, the, mid, 17th, century, numerous, small, dutch, and, flemish, distillers, had, popularized, the, re, distillation, of, malted, barley, spirit, or, malt, wine, with, juniper, also, anise, caraway, coriander, etc, which, were, sold, in, pharmacies, and, used, to, treat, such, medical, problems, as, kidney, ailments, lumbago, stomach, ailments, gallstones, and, gout, gin, emerged, in, england, in, varying, forms, by, the, early, 17th, century, and, at, the, time, of, the, stuart, restoration, enjoyed, a, brief, resurgence, gin, became, vastly, more, popular, as, an, alternative, to, brandy, when, william, iii, and, mary, ii, became, co, sovereigns, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, after, leading, the, glorious, revolution, particularly, in, crude, inferior, forms, it, was, more, likely, to, be, flavoured, with, turpentine, historian, angela, mcshane, has, described, it, as, a, protestant, drink, as, its, rise, was, brought, about, by, a, protestant, king, fuelling, his, armies, fighting, the, catholic, irish, and, french, gin, drinking, in, england, rose, significantly, after, the, government, allowed, unlicensed, gin, production, and, at, the, same, time, imposed, a, heavy, duty, on, all, imported, spirits, such, as, french, brandy, this, created, a, larger, market, for, poor, quality, barley, that, was, unfit, for, brewing, beer, and, in, 1695, 1735, thousands, of, gin, shops, sprang, up, throughout, england, a, period, known, as, the, gin, craze, because, of, the, low, price, of, gin, compared, with, other, drinks, available, at, the, time, and, in, the, same, location, gin, began, to, be, consumed, regularly, by, the, poor, of, the, 15, 000, drinking, establishments, in, london, not, including, coffee, shops, and, drinking, chocolate, shops, over, half, were, gin, shops, beer, maintained, a, healthy, reputation, as, it, was, often, safer, to, drink, the, brewed, ale, than, unclean, plain, water, gin, though, was, blamed, for, various, social, problems, and, it, may, have, been, a, factor, in, the, higher, death, rates, which, stabilized, london, s, previously, growing, population, the, reputation, of, the, two, drinks, was, illustrated, by, william, hogarth, in, his, engravings, beer, street, and, gin, lane, 1751, described, by, the, bbc, as, arguably, the, most, potent, anti, drug, poster, ever, conceived, the, negative, reputation, of, gin, survives, in, the, english, language, in, terms, like, gin, mills, or, the, american, phrase, gin, joints, to, describe, disreputable, bars, or, gin, soaked, to, refer, to, drunks, the, epithet, mother, s, ruin, is, a, common, british, name, for, gin, the, origin, of, which, is, debated, the, gin, act, 1736, imposed, high, taxes, on, retailers, and, led, to, riots, in, the, streets, the, prohibitive, duty, was, gradually, reduced, and, finally, abolished, in, 1742, the, gin, act, 1751, was, more, successful, but, it, forced, distillers, to, sell, only, to, licensed, retailers, and, brought, gin, shops, under, the, jurisdiction, of, local, magistrates, gin, in, the, 18th, century, was, produced, in, pot, stills, and, thus, had, a, maltier, profile, than, modern, london, gin, in, london, in, the, early, 18th, century, much, gin, was, distilled, legally, in, residential, houses, there, were, estimated, to, be, 1, 500, residential, stills, in, 1726, and, was, often, flavoured, with, turpentine, to, generate, resinous, woody, notes, in, addition, to, the, juniper, as, late, as, 1913, webster, s, dictionary, states, without, further, comment, common, gin, is, usually, flavoured, with, turpentine, another, common, variation, was, to, distill, in, the, presence, of, sulfuric, acid, although, the, acid, itself, does, not, distil, it, imparts, the, additional, aroma, of, diethyl, ether, to, the, resulting, gin, sulfuric, acid, subtracts, one, water, molecule, from, two, ethanol, molecules, to, create, diethyl, ether, which, also, forms, an, azeotrope, with, ethanol, and, therefore, distils, with, it, the, result, is, a, sweeter, spirit, and, one, that, may, have, possessed, additional, analgesic, or, even, intoxicating, effects, see, paracelsus, dutch, or, belgian, gin, also, known, as, jenever, or, genever, evolved, from, malt, wine, spirits, and, is, a, distinctly, different, drink, from, later, styles, of, gin, schiedam, a, city, in, the, province, of, south, holland, is, famous, for, its, jenever, producing, history, the, same, for, hasselt, in, the, belgian, province, of, limburg, the, oude, old, style, of, jenever, remained, very, popular, throughout, the, 19th, century, where, it, was, referred, to, as, holland, or, geneva, gin, in, popular, american, pre, prohibition, bartender, guides, the, 18th, century, gave, rise, to, a, style, of, gin, referred, to, as, old, tom, gin, which, is, a, softer, sweeter, style, of, gin, often, containing, sugar, old, tom, gin, faded, in, popularity, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, invention, and, development, of, the, column, still, 1826, and, 1831, made, the, distillation, of, neutral, spirits, practical, thus, enabling, the, creation, of, the, london, dry, style, that, evolved, later, in, the, 19th, century, in, tropical, british, colonies, gin, was, used, to, mask, the, bitter, flavour, of, quinine, which, was, the, only, effective, anti, malarial, compound, quinine, was, dissolved, in, carbonated, water, to, form, tonic, water, the, resulting, cocktail, is, gin, and, tonic, although, modern, tonic, water, contains, only, a, trace, of, quinine, as, a, flavouring, gin, is, a, common, base, spirit, for, many, mixed, drinks, including, the, martini, secretly, produced, bathtub, gin, was, available, in, the, speakeasies, and, blind, pigs, of, prohibition, era, america, as, a, result, of, the, relatively, simple, production, sloe, gin, is, traditionally, described, as, a, liqueur, made, by, infusing, sloes, the, fruit, of, the, blackthorn, in, gin, although, modern, versions, are, almost, always, compounded, from, neutral, spirits, and, flavourings, similar, infusions, are, possible, with, other, fruits, such, as, damsons, another, popular, gin, based, liqueur, with, a, longstanding, history, is, pimm, s, no, 1, cup, 25, alcohol, by, volume, abv, which, is, a, fruit, cup, flavoured, with, citrus, and, spices, the, national, jenever, museums, are, located, in, hasselt, in, belgium, and, schiedam, in, the, netherlands, since, 2013, gin, has, been, in, a, period, of, ascendancy, worldwide, with, many, new, brands, and, producers, entering, the, category, leading, to, a, period, of, strong, growth, innovation, and, change, more, recently, gin, based, liqueurs, have, been, popularised, reaching, a, market, outside, that, of, traditional, gin, drinkers, including, fruit, flavoured, and, usually, coloured, pink, gin, rhubarb, gin, spiced, gin, violet, gin, blood, orange, gin, and, sloe, gin, surging, popularity, and, unchecked, competition, has, led, to, consumer, s, conflation, of, gin, with, gin, liqueurs, and, many, products, are, straddling, pushing, or, breaking, the, boundaries, of, established, definitions, in, a, period, of, genesis, for, the, industry, some, legal, classifications, protected, denomination, of, origin, define, gin, as, only, originating, from, specific, geographical, areas, without, any, further, restrictions, e, g, plymouth, gin, pgi, now, lapsed, ostfriesischer, korngenever, slovensk, borovi, ka, kra, ki, brinjevec, etc, while, other, common, descriptors, refer, to, classic, styles, that, are, culturally, recognised, but, not, legally, defined, e, g, old, tom, gin, sloe, gin, is, also, worth, mentioning, as, although, technically, a, gin, based, liqueur, it, is, unique, in, that, the, eu, spirit, drink, regulations, stipulate, the, colloquial, term, sloe, gin, can, legally, be, used, without, the, liqueur, suffix, when, certain, production, criteria, are, met, according, to, the, canadian, food, and, drug, regulation, gin, is, produced, through, redistillation, of, alcohol, from, juniper, berries, or, a, mixture, of, more, than, one, such, redistilled, food, products, the, canadian, food, and, drug, regulation, recognises, gin, with, three, different, definitions, genever, gin, london, or, dry, gin, that, loosely, approximate, the, us, definitions, whereas, a, more, detailed, regulation, is, provided, for, holland, gin, or, genever, no, distinction, is, made, between, compounded, gin, and, distilled, gin, either, compounded, or, distilled, gin, can, be, labelled, as, dry, gin, or, london, dry, gin, if, it, does, not, contain, any, sweetening, agents, for, genever, and, gin, they, shall, not, contain, more, than, two, percent, sweetening, agents, although, many, different, styles, of, gin, have, evolved, it, is, legally, differentiated, into, four, categories, in, the, european, union, as, follows, juniper, flavoured, spirit, drinks, include, the, earliest, class, of, gin, which, is, produced, by, pot, distilling, a, fermented, grain, mash, to, moderate, strength, e, g, 68, abv, and, then, redistilling, it, with, botanicals, to, extract, the, aromatic, compounds, it, must, be, bottled, at, a, minimum, of, 30, abv, juniper, flavoured, spirit, drinks, may, also, be, sold, under, the, names, wacholder, or, ginebra, gin, is, a, juniper, flavoured, spirit, made, not, via, the, redistillation, of, botanicals, but, by, simply, adding, approved, natural, flavouring, substances, to, a, neutral, spirit, of, agricultural, origin, the, predominant, flavour, must, be, juniper, minimum, bottled, strength, is, 37, 5, abv, distilled, gin, is, produced, exclusively, by, redistilling, ethanol, of, agricultural, origin, with, an, initial, strength, of, 96, abv, the, azeotrope, of, water, and, ethanol, in, the, presence, of, juniper, berries, and, of, other, natural, botanicals, provided, that, the, juniper, taste, is, predominant, gin, obtained, simply, by, adding, essences, or, flavourings, to, ethanol, of, agricultural, origin, is, not, distilled, gin, minimum, bottled, strength, is, 37, 5, abv, london, gin, is, obtained, exclusively, from, ethanol, of, agricultural, origin, with, a, maximum, methanol, content, of, 5, g, 0, 18, oz, per, hectolitre, of, 100, abv, equivalent, whose, flavour, is, introduced, exclusively, through, the, re, distillation, in, traditional, stills, of, ethanol, in, the, presence, of, all, the, natural, plant, materials, used, the, resultant, distillate, of, which, is, at, least, 70, abv, london, gin, may, not, contain, added, sweetening, exceeding, 0, 1, g, 0, 0035, oz, of, sugars, per, litre, of, the, final, product, nor, colourants, nor, any, added, ingredients, other, than, water, the, predominant, flavour, must, be, juniper, the, term, london, gin, may, be, supplemented, by, the, term, dry, minimum, bottled, strength, is, 37, 5, abv, in, the, united, states, of, america, gin, is, defined, as, an, alcoholic, beverage, of, no, less, than, 40, abv, 80, proof, that, possesses, the, characteristic, flavour, of, juniper, berries, gin, produced, only, through, the, redistillation, of, botanicals, can, be, further, distinguished, and, marketed, as, distilled, gin, gin, can, be, broadly, differentiated, into, three, basic, styles, reflecting, modernization, in, its, distillation, and, flavouring, techniques, pot, distilled, gin, represents, the, earliest, style, of, gin, and, is, traditionally, produced, by, pot, distilling, a, fermented, grain, mash, malt, wine, from, barley, or, other, grains, then, redistilling, it, with, flavouring, botanicals, to, extract, the, aromatic, compounds, a, double, gin, can, be, produced, by, redistilling, the, first, gin, again, with, more, botanicals, due, to, the, use, of, pot, stills, the, alcohol, content, of, the, distillate, is, relatively, low, around, 68, abv, for, a, single, distilled, gin, or, 76, abv, for, a, double, gin, this, type, of, gin, is, often, aged, in, tanks, or, wooden, casks, and, retains, a, heavier, malty, flavour, that, gives, it, a, marked, resemblance, to, whisky, korenwijn, grain, wine, and, the, oude, old, style, of, geneva, gin, or, holland, gin, represent, the, most, prominent, gins, of, this, class, column, distilled, gin, evolved, following, the, invention, of, the, coffey, still, and, is, produced, by, first, distilling, high, proof, e, g, 96, abv, neutral, spirits, from, a, fermented, mash, or, wash, using, a, refluxing, still, such, as, a, column, still, the, fermentable, base, for, this, spirit, may, be, derived, from, grain, sugar, beets, grapes, potatoes, sugar, cane, plain, sugar, or, any, other, material, of, agricultural, origin, the, highly, concentrated, spirit, is, then, redistilled, with, juniper, berries, and, other, botanicals, in, a, pot, still, most, often, the, botanicals, are, suspended, in, a, gin, basket, positioned, within, the, head, of, the, still, which, allows, the, hot, alcoholic, vapours, to, extract, flavouring, components, from, the, botanical, charge, this, method, yields, a, gin, lighter, in, flavour, than, the, older, pot, still, method, and, results, in, either, a, distilled, gin, or, london, dry, gin, depending, largely, upon, how, the, spirit, is, finished, compound, gin, is, made, by, compounding, blending, neutral, spirits, with, essences, other, natural, flavourings, or, ingredients, left, to, infuse, in, neutral, spirit, without, redistillation, popular, botanicals, or, flavouring, agents, for, gin, besides, the, required, juniper, often, include, citrus, elements, such, as, lemon, and, bitter, orange, peel, as, well, as, a, combination, of, other, spices, which, may, include, any, of, anise, angelica, root, and, seed, orris, root, cardamom, pine, needles, and, cone, licorice, root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime, peel, grapefruit, peel, dragon, eye, longan, saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains, of, paradise, nutmeg, cassia, bark, or, others, the, different, combinations, and, concentrations, of, these, botanicals, in, the, distillation, process, cause, the, variations, in, taste, among, gin, products, chemical, research, has, begun, to, identify, the, various, chemicals, that, are, extracted, in, the, distillation, process, and, contribute, to, gin, s, flavouring, for, example, juniper, monoterpenes, come, from, juniper, berries, citric, and, berry, flavours, come, from, chemicals, such, as, limonene, and, gamma, terpinene, linalool, found, in, limes, blueberries, and, hops, amongst, others, floral, notes, come, from, compounds, such, as, geraniol, and, eugenol, spice, like, flavours, come, from, chemicals, such, as, sabinene, delta, 3, carene, and, para, cymene, in, 2018, more, than, half, the, growth, in, the, uk, gin, category, was, contributed, by, flavoured, gin, a, well, known, gin, cocktail, is, the, martini, traditionally, made, with, gin, and, dry, vermouth, several, other, notable, gin, based, drinks, include
