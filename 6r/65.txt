chocolate, or, cocoa, is, a, food, made, from, roasted, and, ground, cocoa, seed, kernels, that, is, available, as, a, liquid, solid, or, paste, either, on, its, own, or, as, a, flavoring, agent, in, other, foods, cocoa, has, been, consumed, in, some, form, for, at, least, 5, 300, years, starting, with, the, mayo, chinchipe, culture, in, what, is, present, day, ecuador, later, mesoamerican, civilizations, also, consumed, chocolate, beverages, and, it, was, introduced, to, europe, in, the, 16th, century, the, seeds, of, the, cacao, tree, theobroma, cacao, have, an, intense, bitter, taste, and, must, be, fermented, to, develop, the, flavor, after, fermentation, the, seeds, are, dried, cleaned, and, roasted, the, shell, is, removed, to, produce, nibs, which, are, then, ground, to, cocoa, mass, unadulterated, chocolate, in, rough, form, once, the, cocoa, mass, is, liquefied, by, heating, it, is, called, chocolate, liquor, the, liquor, may, also, be, cooled, and, processed, into, its, two, components, cocoa, solids, and, cocoa, butter, baking, chocolate, also, called, bitter, chocolate, contains, cocoa, solids, and, cocoa, butter, in, varying, proportions, without, any, added, sugar, powdered, baking, cocoa, which, contains, more, fiber, than, cocoa, butter, can, be, processed, with, alkali, to, produce, dutch, cocoa, much, of, the, chocolate, consumed, today, is, in, the, form, of, sweet, chocolate, a, combination, of, cocoa, solids, cocoa, butter, and, added, vegetable, oils, and, sugar, milk, chocolate, is, sweet, chocolate, that, additionally, contains, milk, powder, or, condensed, milk, white, chocolate, contains, cocoa, butter, sugar, and, milk, but, no, cocoa, solids, chocolate, is, one, of, the, most, popular, food, types, and, flavors, in, the, world, and, many, foodstuffs, involving, chocolate, exist, particularly, desserts, including, cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate, brownies, and, chocolate, chip, cookies, many, candies, are, filled, with, or, coated, with, sweetened, chocolate, chocolate, bars, either, made, of, solid, chocolate, or, other, ingredients, coated, in, chocolate, are, eaten, as, snacks, gifts, of, chocolate, molded, into, different, shapes, such, as, eggs, hearts, and, coins, are, traditional, on, certain, western, holidays, including, christmas, easter, valentine, s, day, and, hanukkah, chocolate, is, also, used, in, cold, and, hot, beverages, such, as, chocolate, milk, and, hot, chocolate, and, in, some, alcoholic, drinks, such, as, cr, me, de, cacao, although, cocoa, originated, in, the, americas, west, african, countries, particularly, c, te, d, ivoire, and, ghana, are, the, leading, producers, of, cocoa, in, the, 21st, century, accounting, for, some, 60, of, the, world, cocoa, supply, a, 2020, report, estimated, that, more, than, 1, 5, million, children, are, involved, in, the, farming, of, cocoa, in, c, te, d, ivoire, and, ghana, child, slavery, and, trafficking, associated, with, the, cocoa, trade, remain, major, concerns, a, 2018, report, argued, that, international, attempts, to, improve, conditions, for, children, were, doomed, to, failure, because, of, persistent, poverty, the, absence, of, schools, increasing, world, cocoa, demand, more, intensive, farming, of, cocoa, and, continued, exploitation, of, child, labor, cocoa, is, a, variant, of, cacao, likely, due, to, confusion, with, the, word, coco, it, is, ultimately, derived, from, kakaw, a, but, whether, that, word, originates, in, nahuatl, or, a, mixe, zoquean, language, is, the, subject, of, substantial, linguistic, debate, chocolate, is, a, spanish, loanword, first, recorded, in, english, in, 1604, and, first, recorded, in, spanish, in, 1579, the, word, for, chocolate, drink, in, early, nahuatl, texts, is, cacahuatl, meaning, cacao, water, which, chocolate, does, not, immediately, derive, from, despite, theories, that, chocolate, is, derived, from, xocoatl, meaning, bitter, drink, or, chocolatl, meaning, hot, water, and, uncertainty, around, the, nahuatl, origin, there, is, a, consensus, that, it, likely, derives, from, chicolatl, whether, chicolatl, means, cacao, beater, however, is, contested, due, to, difficulty, knowing, what, chico, means, the, term, chocolatier, for, a, chocolate, confection, maker, is, recorded, from, 1859, evidence, for, the, domestication, of, the, cacao, tree, exists, as, early, as, 5300, bp, in, south, america, before, it, was, introduced, to, mesoamerica, it, is, unknown, when, chocolate, was, first, consumed, as, opposed, to, other, cacao, based, drinks, and, there, is, evidence, the, olmecs, the, earliest, known, major, mesoamerican, civilization, fermented, the, sweet, pulp, surrounding, the, cacao, beans, into, an, alcoholic, beverage, chocolate, was, extremely, important, to, several, mesoamerican, societies, and, cacao, was, considered, a, gift, from, the, gods, by, the, mayans, and, the, aztecs, the, cocoa, bean, was, used, as, a, currency, across, civilizations, and, was, used, in, ceremonies, as, a, tribute, to, leaders, and, gods, and, as, a, medicine, chocolate, in, mesoamerica, was, a, bitter, drink, flavored, with, additives, such, as, vanilla, earflower, and, chili, and, was, capped, with, a, dark, brown, foam, created, by, pouring, the, liquid, from, a, height, between, containers, while, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, may, have, been, the, first, european, to, encounter, chocolate, when, he, observed, it, in, the, court, of, moctezuma, ii, in, 1520, it, proved, to, be, an, acquired, taste, and, it, took, until, 1585, for, the, first, official, recording, of, a, shipment, of, cocoa, beans, to, europe, chocolate, was, believed, to, be, an, aphrodisiac, and, medicine, and, spread, across, europe, in, the, 17th, century, sweetened, served, warm, and, flavored, with, familiar, spices, it, was, initially, primarily, consumed, by, the, elite, with, expensive, cocoa, supplied, by, colonial, plantations, in, the, americas, in, the, 18th, century, it, was, considered, southern, european, aristocratic, and, catholic, and, was, still, produced, in, a, similar, way, to, the, way, it, had, been, produced, by, the, aztecs, starting, in, the, 18th, century, chocolate, production, was, improved, in, the, 19th, century, engine, powered, milling, was, developed, and, in, 1828, coenraad, johannes, van, houten, received, a, patent, for, a, process, making, dutch, cocoa, this, removed, cocoa, butter, from, chocolate, liquor, the, product, of, milling, and, permitted, large, scale, production, of, chocolate, other, developments, in, the, 19th, century, including, the, melanger, a, mixing, machine, modern, milk, chocolate, the, conching, process, to, make, chocolate, smoother, and, change, the, flavour, meant, a, worker, in, 1890, could, produce, fifty, times, more, chocolate, with, the, same, labor, than, they, could, before, the, industrial, revolution, and, chocolate, became, a, food, to, be, eaten, rather, than, drunk, as, production, moved, from, the, americas, to, asia, and, africa, mass, markets, in, western, nations, for, chocolate, opened, up, in, the, early, 20th, century, british, chocolate, producers, including, cadbury, and, fry, s, faced, controversy, over, the, labor, conditions, in, the, portuguese, cacao, industry, in, africa, a, 1908, report, by, a, cadbury, agent, described, conditions, as, de, facto, slavery, while, conditions, somewhat, improved, with, a, boycott, by, chocolate, makers, slave, labor, among, african, cacao, growers, again, gained, public, attention, in, the, early, 21st, century, during, the, 20th, century, chocolate, production, further, developed, with, development, of, the, tempering, technique, to, improve, the, snap, and, gloss, of, chocolate, and, the, addition, of, lecithin, to, improve, texture, and, consistency, white, and, couverture, chocolate, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, and, the, bean, to, bar, trade, model, began, several, types, of, chocolate, can, be, distinguished, pure, unsweetened, chocolate, often, called, baking, chocolate, contains, primarily, cocoa, solids, and, cocoa, butter, in, varying, proportions, much, of, the, chocolate, consumed, today, is, in, the, form, of, sweet, chocolate, which, combines, chocolate, with, sugar, the, traditional, types, of, chocolate, are, dark, milk, and, white, all, of, them, contain, cocoa, butter, which, is, the, ingredient, defining, the, physical, properties, of, chocolate, consistency, and, melting, temperature, plain, or, dark, chocolate, as, it, name, suggests, is, a, form, of, chocolate, that, is, similar, to, pure, cocoa, liquor, although, is, usually, made, with, a, slightly, higher, proportion, of, cocoa, butter, it, is, simply, defined, by, its, cocoa, percentage, in, milk, chocolate, the, non, fat, cocoa, solids, are, partly, or, mostly, replaced, by, milk, solids, in, white, chocolate, they, are, all, replaced, by, milk, solids, hence, its, ivory, color, other, forms, of, eating, chocolate, exist, these, include, raw, chocolate, made, with, unroasted, beans, and, ruby, chocolate, an, additional, popular, form, of, eating, chocolate, gianduja, is, made, by, incorporating, nut, paste, typically, hazelnut, to, the, chocolate, paste, other, types, of, chocolate, are, used, in, baking, and, confectionery, these, include, baking, chocolate, often, unsweetened, couverture, chocolate, used, for, coating, compound, chocolate, a, lower, cost, alternative, and, modeling, chocolate, modeling, chocolate, is, a, chocolate, paste, made, by, melting, chocolate, and, combining, it, with, corn, syrup, glucose, syrup, or, golden, syrup, chocolate, is, made, from, cocoa, beans, the, dried, and, fermented, seeds, of, the, cacao, tree, theobroma, cacao, a, small, 4, 8, m, tall, 15, 26, ft, tall, evergreen, tree, native, to, the, deep, tropical, region, of, the, americas, recent, genetic, studies, suggest, the, most, common, genotype, of, the, plant, originated, in, the, amazon, basin, and, was, gradually, transported, by, humans, throughout, south, and, central, america, early, forms, of, another, genotype, have, also, been, found, in, what, is, now, venezuela, the, scientific, name, theobroma, means, food, of, the, gods, the, fruit, called, a, cocoa, pod, is, ovoid, 15, 30, cm, 6, 12, in, long, and, 8, 10, cm, 3, 4, in, wide, ripening, yellow, to, orange, and, weighing, about, 500, g, 1, 1, lb, when, ripe, cacao, trees, are, small, understory, trees, that, need, rich, well, drained, soils, they, naturally, grow, within, 20, of, either, side, of, the, equator, because, they, need, about, 2000, mm, of, rainfall, a, year, and, temperatures, in, the, range, of, 21, to, 32, c, 70, to, 90, f, cacao, trees, cannot, tolerate, a, temperature, lower, than, 15, c, 59, f, the, sequencing, in, 2010, of, the, genome, of, the, cacao, tree, may, allow, yields, to, be, improved, due, to, concerns, about, global, warming, effects, on, lowland, climate, in, the, narrow, band, of, latitudes, where, cocoa, is, grown, 20, degrees, north, and, south, of, the, equator, the, commercial, company, mars, incorporated, and, the, university, of, california, berkeley, are, conducting, genomic, research, in, 2017, 18, to, improve, the, survivability, of, cacao, plants, in, hot, climates, the, three, main, varieties, of, cocoa, beans, used, in, chocolate, are, criollo, forastero, and, trinitario, cocoa, pods, are, harvested, by, cutting, them, from, the, tree, using, a, machete, or, by, knocking, them, off, the, tree, using, a, stick, it, is, important, to, harvest, the, pods, when, they, are, fully, ripe, because, if, the, pod, is, unripe, the, beans, will, have, a, low, cocoa, butter, content, or, low, sugar, content, reducing, the, ultimate, flavor, the, beans, which, are, sterile, within, their, pods, and, their, surrounding, pulp, are, removed, from, the, pods, and, placed, in, piles, or, bins, to, ferment, micro, organisms, present, naturally, in, the, environment, ferment, the, pectin, containing, material, yeasts, produce, ethanol, lactic, acid, bacteria, produce, lactic, acid, and, acetic, acid, bacteria, produce, acetic, acid, in, some, cocoa, producing, regions, an, association, between, filamentous, fungi, and, bacteria, called, cocobiota, acts, to, produce, metabolites, beneficial, to, human, health, when, consumed, the, fermentation, process, which, takes, up, to, seven, days, also, produces, several, flavor, precursors, that, eventually, provide, the, chocolate, taste, after, fermentation, the, beans, must, be, dried, to, prevent, mold, growth, climate, and, weather, permitting, this, is, done, by, spreading, the, beans, out, in, the, sun, from, five, to, seven, days, in, some, growing, regions, for, example, tobago, the, dried, beans, are, then, polished, for, sale, by, dancing, the, cocoa, spreading, the, beans, onto, a, floor, adding, oil, or, water, and, shuffling, the, beans, against, each, other, using, bare, feet, in, an, alternative, process, known, as, moist, incubation, the, beans, are, dried, without, fermentation, the, nibs, are, then, removed, and, hydrated, in, an, acidic, solution, they, are, heated, for, 72, hours, and, dried, again, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, showed, that, the, incubated, chocolate, had, higher, levels, of, strecker, aldehydes, and, lower, levels, of, pyrazines, the, dried, beans, are, then, transported, to, a, chocolate, manufacturing, facility, the, beans, are, cleaned, removing, twigs, stones, and, other, debris, roasted, and, graded, next, the, shell, of, each, bean, is, removed, to, extract, the, nib, the, nibs, are, ground, and, liquefied, resulting, in, pure, chocolate, liquor, the, liquor, can, be, further, processed, into, cocoa, solids, and, cocoa, butter, producers, of, high, quality, small, batch, chocolate, argue, that, mass, production, produces, bad, quality, chocolate, some, mass, produced, chocolate, contains, much, less, cocoa, as, low, as, 7, in, many, cases, and, fats, other, than, cocoa, butter, vegetable, oils, and, artificial, vanilla, flavor, are, often, used, in, cheaper, chocolate, to, mask, poorly, fermented, and, or, roasted, beans, the, penultimate, process, is, called, conching, a, conche, is, a, container, filled, with, metal, beads, which, act, as, grinders, the, refined, and, blended, chocolate, mass, is, kept, in, a, liquid, state, by, frictional, heat, chocolate, before, conching, has, an, uneven, and, gritty, texture, the, conching, process, produces, cocoa, and, sugar, particles, smaller, than, the, tongue, can, detect, typically, around, 20, m, and, reduces, rough, edges, hence, the, smooth, feel, in, the, mouth, the, length, of, the, conching, process, determines, the, final, smoothness, and, quality, of, the, chocolate, high, quality, chocolate, is, conched, for, about, 72, hours, and, lesser, grades, about, four, to, six, hours, after, the, process, is, complete, the, chocolate, mass, is, stored, in, tanks, heated, to, about, 45, to, 50, c, 113, to, 122, f, until, final, processing, after, conching, chocolate, is, tempered, this, process, aims, to, create, a, crystallize, a, small, amount, of, fat, in, a, particularly, stable, formation, around, this, small, amount, of, crystals, the, rest, of, the, fats, crystallize, creating, a, glossy, chocolate, with, a, crisp, break, chocolate, is, molded, in, different, shapes, for, different, uses, chocolate, is, very, sensitive, to, temperature, and, humidity, ideal, storage, temperatures, are, between, 15, and, 17, c, 59, and, 63, f, with, a, relative, humidity, of, less, than, 50, if, refrigerated, or, frozen, without, containment, chocolate, can, absorb, enough, moisture, to, cause, a, whitish, discoloration, the, result, of, fat, or, sugar, crystals, rising, to, the, surface, various, types, of, blooming, effects, can, occur, if, chocolate, is, stored, or, served, improperly, chocolate, bloom, is, caused, by, storage, temperature, fluctuating, or, exceeding, 24, c, 75, f, while, sugar, bloom, is, caused, by, temperature, below, 15, c, 59, f, or, excess, humidity, to, distinguish, between, different, types, of, bloom, one, can, rub, the, surface, of, the, chocolate, lightly, and, if, the, bloom, disappears, it, is, fat, bloom, moving, chocolate, between, temperature, extremes, can, result, in, an, oily, texture, although, visually, unappealing, chocolate, suffering, from, bloom, is, safe, for, consumption, and, taste, is, unaffected, bloom, can, be, reversed, by, retempering, the, chocolate, or, using, it, for, any, use, that, requires, melting, the, chocolate, chocolate, is, generally, stored, away, from, other, foods, as, it, can, absorb, different, aromas, ideally, chocolates, are, packed, or, wrapped, and, placed, in, proper, storage, with, the, correct, humidity, and, temperature, additionally, chocolate, is, frequently, stored, in, a, dark, place, or, protected, from, light, by, wrapping, paper, the, glossy, shine, snap, aroma, texture, and, taste, of, the, chocolate, can, show, the, quality, and, whether, it, was, stored, well, one, hundred, grams, of, milk, chocolate, supplies, 540, calories, it, is, 59, carbohydrates, 52, as, sugar, and, 3, as, dietary, fiber, 30, fat, and, 8, protein, table, approximately, 65, of, the, fat, in, milk, chocolate, is, saturated, mainly, palmitic, acid, and, stearic, acid, while, the, predominant, unsaturated, fat, is, oleic, acid, table, 100, grams, of, milk, chocolate, is, an, excellent, source, over, 19, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, riboflavin, vitamin, b12, and, the, dietary, minerals, manganese, phosphorus, and, zinc, chocolate, is, a, good, source, 10, 19, dv, of, calcium, magnesium, and, iron, chocolate, contains, polyphenols, especially, flavan, 3, ols, catechins, and, smaller, amounts, of, other, flavonoids, it, also, contains, alkaloids, such, as, theobromine, phenethylamine, and, caffeine, which, are, under, study, for, their, potential, effects, in, the, body, it, is, unlikely, that, chocolate, consumption, in, small, amounts, causes, lead, poisoning, some, studies, have, shown, that, lead, may, bind, to, cocoa, shells, and, contamination, may, occur, during, the, manufacturing, process, one, study, showed, the, mean, lead, level, in, milk, chocolate, candy, bars, was, 0, 027, g, lead, per, gram, of, candy, another, study, found, that, some, chocolate, purchased, at, u, s, supermarkets, contained, up, to, 0, 965, g, per, gram, close, to, the, international, voluntary, standard, limit, for, lead, in, cocoa, powder, or, beans, which, is, 1, g, of, lead, per, gram, in, 2006, the, u, s, fda, lowered, by, one, fifth, the, amount, of, lead, permissible, in, candy, but, compliance, is, only, voluntary, studies, concluded, that, children, who, are, big, consumers, of, chocolates, may, be, at, risk, of, exceeding, the, daily, limit, of, lead, whereas, one, 10, g, cube, of, dark, chocolate, may, contain, as, much, as, 20, of, the, daily, lead, oral, limit, moreover, chocolate, may, not, be, the, only, source, of, lead, in, their, nutrition, and, chocolate, might, be, a, significant, source, of, cadmium, and, lead, ingestion, particularly, for, children, according, to, a, 2005, study, the, average, lead, concentration, of, cocoa, beans, is, 0, 5, ng, g, which, is, one, of, the, lowest, reported, values, for, a, natural, food, however, during, cultivation, and, production, chocolate, may, absorb, lead, from, the, environment, such, as, in, atmospheric, emissions, of, now, unused, leaded, gasoline, the, european, food, safety, authority, recommended, a, tolerable, weekly, intake, for, cadmium, of, 2, 5, micrograms, per, kg, of, body, weight, for, europeans, indicating, that, consuming, chocolate, products, caused, exposure, of, about, 4, among, all, foods, eaten, 1986, california, proposition, 65, requires, a, warning, label, on, chocolate, products, having, more, than, 4, 1, mg, of, cadmium, per, daily, serving, of, a, single, product, one, tablespoonful, 5, grams, of, dry, unsweetened, cocoa, powder, has, 12, 1, mg, of, caffeine, and, a, 25, g, single, serving, of, dark, chocolate, has, 22, 4, mg, of, caffeine, although, a, single, 7, oz, 200, ml, serving, of, coffee, may, contain, 80, 175, mg, studies, have, shown, psychoactive, effects, in, caffeine, doses, as, low, as, 9, mg, and, a, dose, as, low, as, 12, 5, mg, was, shown, to, have, effects, on, cognitive, performance, chocolate, may, be, a, factor, for, heartburn, in, some, people, because, one, of, its, constituents, theobromine, may, affect, the, esophageal, sphincter, muscle, in, a, way, that, permits, stomach, acids, to, enter, the, esophagus, theobromine, poisoning, is, an, overdosage, reaction, to, the, bitter, alkaloid, which, happens, more, frequently, in, domestic, animals, than, humans, however, daily, intake, of, 50, 100, g, cocoa, 0, 8, 1, 5, g, theobromine, by, humans, has, been, associated, with, sweating, trembling, and, severe, headache, chocolate, and, cocoa, contain, moderate, to, high, amounts, of, oxalate, which, may, increase, the, risk, of, kidney, stones, in, sufficient, amounts, the, theobromine, found, in, chocolate, is, toxic, to, animals, such, as, cats, dogs, horses, parrots, and, small, rodents, because, they, are, unable, to, metabolize, the, chemical, effectively, if, animals, are, fed, chocolate, the, theobromine, may, remain, in, the, circulation, for, up, to, 20, hours, possibly, causing, epileptic, seizures, heart, attacks, internal, bleeding, and, eventually, death, medical, treatment, performed, by, a, veterinarian, involves, inducing, vomiting, within, two, hours, of, ingestion, and, administration, of, benzodiazepines, or, barbiturates, for, seizures, antiarrhythmics, for, heart, arrhythmias, and, fluid, diuresis, a, typical, 20, kilogram, 44, lb, dog, will, normally, experience, great, intestinal, distress, after, eating, less, than, 240, grams, 8, 5, oz, of, dark, chocolate, but, will, not, necessarily, experience, bradycardia, or, tachycardia, unless, it, eats, at, least, a, half, a, kilogram, 1, 1, lb, of, milk, chocolate, dark, chocolate, has, 2, to, 5, times, more, theobromine, and, thus, is, more, dangerous, to, dogs, according, to, the, merck, veterinary, manual, approximately, 1, 3, grams, of, baker, s, chocolate, per, kilogram, of, a, dog, s, body, weight, 0, 02, oz, lb, is, sufficient, to, cause, symptoms, of, toxicity, for, example, a, typical, 25, gram, 0, 88, oz, baker, s, chocolate, bar, would, be, enough, to, bring, about, symptoms, in, a, 20, kilogram, 44, lb, dog, in, the, 20th, century, there, were, reports, that, mulch, made, from, cocoa, bean, shells, is, dangerous, to, dogs, and, livestock, commonly, consumed, chocolate, is, high, in, fat, and, sugar, which, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, for, obesity, when, chocolate, is, consumed, in, excess, overall, evidence, is, insufficient, to, determine, the, relationship, between, chocolate, consumption, and, acne, various, studies, point, not, to, chocolate, but, to, the, high, glycemic, nature, of, certain, foods, like, sugar, corn, syrup, and, other, simple, carbohydrates, as, potential, causes, of, acne, along, with, other, possible, dietary, factors, food, including, chocolate, is, not, typically, viewed, as, addictive, some, people, however, may, want, or, crave, chocolate, leading, to, a, self, described, term, chocoholic, by, some, popular, myths, chocolate, is, considered, to, be, a, mood, enhancer, such, as, by, increasing, sex, drive, or, stimulating, cognition, but, there, is, little, scientific, evidence, that, such, effects, are, consistent, among, all, chocolate, consumers, if, mood, improvement, from, eating, chocolate, occurs, there, is, not, enough, research, to, indicate, whether, it, results, from, the, favorable, flavor, or, from, the, stimulant, effects, of, its, constituents, such, as, caffeine, theobromine, or, their, parent, molecule, methylxanthine, a, 2019, review, reported, that, chocolate, consumption, does, not, improve, depressive, mood, reviews, support, a, short, term, effect, of, lowering, blood, pressure, by, consuming, cocoa, products, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, long, term, cardiovascular, health, benefit, chocolate, and, cocoa, are, under, preliminary, research, to, determine, if, consumption, affects, the, risk, of, certain, cardiovascular, diseases, or, enhances, cognitive, abilities, while, daily, consumption, of, cocoa, flavanols, minimum, dose, of, 200, mg, appears, to, benefit, platelet, and, vascular, function, there, is, no, good, evidence, to, indicate, an, effect, on, heart, attacks, or, strokes, research, has, also, shown, that, consuming, dark, chocolate, does, not, substantially, affect, blood, pressure, some, manufacturers, provide, the, percentage, of, chocolate, in, a, finished, chocolate, confection, as, a, label, quoting, percentage, of, cocoa, or, cacao, this, refers, to, the, combined, percentage, of, both, cocoa, solids, and, cocoa, butter, in, the, bar, not, just, the, percentage, of, cocoa, solids, the, belgian, ambao, certification, mark, indicates, that, no, non, cocoa, vegetable, fats, have, been, used, in, making, the, chocolate, a, long, standing, dispute, between, britain, on, the, one, hand, and, belgium, and, france, over, british, use, of, vegetable, fats, in, chocolate, ended, in, 2000, with, the, adoption, of, new, standards, which, permitted, the, use, of, up, to, five, percent,
