hurdling, is, the, act, of, jumping, over, an, obstacle, at, a, high, speed, or, in, a, sprint, in, the, early, 19th, century, hurdlers, ran, at, and, jumped, over, each, hurdle, sometimes, known, as, burgles, landing, on, both, feet, and, checking, their, forward, motion, today, the, dominant, step, patterns, are, the, 3, step, for, high, hurdles, 7, step, for, low, hurdles, and, 15, step, for, intermediate, hurdles, hurdling, is, a, highly, specialized, form, of, obstacle, racing, and, is, part, of, the, sport, of, athletics, in, hurdling, events, barriers, known, as, hurdles, are, set, at, precisely, measured, heights, and, distances, each, athlete, must, pass, over, the, hurdles, passing, under, or, intentionally, knocking, over, hurdles, will, result, in, disqualification, accidental, knocking, over, of, hurdles, is, not, cause, for, disqualification, but, the, hurdles, are, weighted, to, make, doing, so, disadvantageous, in, 1902, spalding, equipment, company, sold, the, foster, patent, safety, hurdle, a, wood, hurdle, in, 1923, some, of, the, wood, hurdles, weighed, 16, lb, 7, 3, kg, each, hurdle, design, improvements, were, made, in, 1935, when, they, developed, the, l, shaped, hurdle, with, this, shape, the, athlete, could, hit, the, hurdle, and, it, will, tip, down, clearing, the, athlete, s, path, the, most, prominent, hurdles, events, are, 110, meters, hurdles, for, men, 100, meters, hurdles, for, women, and, 400, meters, hurdles, both, sexes, these, three, distances, are, all, contested, at, the, summer, olympics, and, the, world, athletics, championships, the, two, shorter, distances, take, place, on, the, straight, of, a, running, track, while, the, 400, m, version, covers, one, whole, lap, of, a, standard, oval, track, events, over, shorter, distances, are, also, commonly, held, at, indoor, track, and, field, events, ranging, from, 50, meters, hurdles, upwards, women, historically, competed, in, the, 80, meters, hurdles, at, the, olympics, in, the, mid, 20th, century, hurdles, race, are, also, part, of, combined, events, contests, including, the, decathlon, and, heptathlon, in, track, races, hurdles, are, normally, 68, 107, cm, 27, 42, in, in, height, depending, on, the, age, and, sex, of, the, hurdler, events, from, 50, to, 110, meters, are, technically, known, as, high, hurdles, races, while, longer, competitions, are, low, hurdles, races, the, track, hurdles, events, are, forms, of, sprinting, competitions, although, the, 400, m, version, is, less, anaerobic, in, nature, and, demands, athletic, qualities, similar, to, the, 800, meters, flat, race, a, hurdling, technique, can, also, be, found, in, the, steeplechase, although, in, this, event, athletes, are, also, permitted, to, step, on, the, barrier, to, clear, it, similarly, in, cross, country, running, athletes, may, hurdle, over, various, natural, obstacles, such, as, logs, mounds, of, earth, and, small, streams, this, represents, the, sporting, origin, of, the, modern, events, horse, racing, has, its, own, variant, of, hurdle, racing, with, similar, principles, the, standard, sprint, or, short, hurdle, race, is, 110, meters, for, men, and, 100, meters, for, women, the, standard, number, of, steps, to, the, first, hurdle, should, be, 8, the, standard, long, hurdle, race, is, 400, meters, for, both, men, and, women, each, of, these, races, is, run, over, ten, hurdles, and, they, are, all, olympic, events, the, men, s, 200, meters, low, hurdles, event, was, on, the, olympic, athletics, programme, for, the, 1900, and, 1904, summer, olympics, these, low, hurdles, events, were, widely, participated, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, particularly, in, north, america, however, beyond, these, two, olympic, outings, they, never, gained, a, consistent, place, at, international, competitions, and, became, increasingly, rare, after, the, 1960s, this, 10, hurdle, race, continues, to, be, run, in, places, such, as, norway, other, distances, are, run, particularly, indoors, but, occasionally, outdoors, the, sprint, hurdle, race, indoors, is, usually, 60, meters, for, both, men, and, women, although, races, 55, meters, or, 50, meters, long, are, sometimes, run, especially, in, the, united, states, a, 60, meter, indoor, race, is, run, over, 5, hurdles, a, shorter, race, may, occasionally, have, only, 4, hurdles, outdoors, a, long, hurdle, race, is, sometimes, shortened, to, 300, meters, for, younger, participants, who, run, over, 8, hurdles, for, example, high, school, and, middle, school, athletes, in, california, minnesota, and, pennsylvania, run, the, 300, meter, hurdles, instead, of, running, the, 400, meter, hurdles, like, the, majority, of, state, competitors, run, today, the, distance, the, hurdles, are, spaced, is, identical, to, the, beginning, of, a, standard, 400, meter, race, which, would, have, 10, hurdles, there, are, also, 200, meter, races, for, middle, school, and, younger, divisions, over, 5, hurdles, spaced, in, the, same, position, as, the, last, 5, hurdles, of, a, standard, 400, meter, race, there, are, five, hurdle, heights, on, most, standard, hurdles, the, highest, position, sometimes, college, high, or, open, high, is, used, for, men, s, sprint, hurdle, races, 60, m, and, 110, m, which, are, 42, inches, 106, 7, cm, the, next, highest, sometimes, high, school, high, 39, inches, 99, 1, cm, is, used, by, veteran, men, under, age, 50, and, younger, boys, the, middle, position, of, 36, inches, 91, 44, cm, sometimes, intermediate, which, is, used, for, men, s, long, hurdle, races, 400, m, plus, some, youth, and, veteran, age, divisions, the, next, lower, position, 33, inches, 83, 8, cm, is, called, the, women, s, high, used, for, women, s, short, hurdle, races, the, lowest, position, called, the, low, hurdle, 30, inches, 76, 2, cm, is, used, for, women, s, long, hurdles, plus, many, youth, and, veteran, races, some, races, call, for, 27, inches, or, 68, 6, centimetres, for, youth, or, veteran, events, hurdles, that, go, to, this, position, are, rare, and, are, notable, by, having, a, sixth, position, in, sprint, hurdle, races, for, men, regardless, of, the, length, of, the, race, the, first, hurdle, is, 13, 72, m, 45, ft, from, the, starting, line, and, the, distance, between, hurdles, is, 9, 14, m, 30, ft, in, sprint, hurdle, races, for, women, the, first, hurdle, is, 13, m, 42, ft, 8, in, from, the, starting, line, and, the, distance, between, hurdles, is, 8, 5, m, 27, ft, 11, in, in, long, hurdle, events, whether, for, men, or, women, the, first, hurdle, is, 45, m, 147, ft, 8, in, from, the, starting, line, and, the, distance, between, hurdles, is, 35, m, 114, ft, 10, in, most, races, which, are, shorter, than, the, standard, distance, such, as, indoor, races, are, simply, run, over, fewer, hurdles, but, use, the, same, distances, from, the, starting, line, there, are, variations, on, hurdle, height, and, spacing, for, the, age, groups, of, athletes, competing, see, masters, athletics, track, and, field, and, youth, athletics, in, order, to, obtain, the, optimal, hurdling, technique, one, must, first, learn, the, proper, running, techniques, it, is, important, that, the, runner, stays, on, the, balls, of, his, or, her, feet, for, the, entirety, of, the, race, this, makes, a, fluid, movement, between, each, stage, of, the, race, there, is, a, technique, that, is, desirable, to, accomplish, efficient, hurdling, action, during, a, race, many, runners, rely, mainly, on, raw, speed, but, proper, technique, and, well, planned, steps, leading, up, to, and, between, each, hurdle, can, allow, an, efficient, hurdler, to, outrun, faster, opponents, generally, the, efficient, hurdler, spends, the, minimum, amount, of, time, and, energy, going, vertically, over, the, hurdle, thus, achieving, maximum, speed, in, the, horizontal, race, direction, down, the, track, when, approaching, the, first, hurdle, athletes, try, to, avoid, stutter, stepping, a, term, used, to, refer, to, the, cutting, of, stride, length, before, reaching, a, hurdle, this, cuts, the, runner, s, momentum, and, costs, valuable, time, athletes, attack, the, hurdle, by, launching, at, it, from, 6, 7, feet, away, depending, on, the, runner, s, closing, speed, the, lead, leg, extended, yet, slightly, bent, because, a, straight, leg, leads, to, more, time, over, the, hurdle, so, that, the, heel, just, narrowly, clears, the, barrier, s, height, after, launching, the, trail, leg, is, tucked, in, horizontally, and, flat, close, to, the, side, of, the, hip, the, objective, is, to, minimize, center, of, gravity, deviation, from, normal, sprinting, and, reduce, time, spent, flying, through, the, air, in, order, to, hurdle, properly, and, not, simply, jump, over, it, a, runner, must, adjust, his, or, her, hips, to, raise, them, over, the, hurdles, this, involves, the, correct, use, of, the, lead, leg, trail, leg, and, arm, positions, the, lead, leg, is, the, leg, that, goes, over, the, hurdle, first, and, should, remain, fairly, straight, upon, crossing, over, the, hurdle, barrier, the, runner, s, lead, leg, snaps, down, quickly, landing, roughly, 1, metre, 3, feet, beyond, the, hurdle, the, trail, leg, follows, the, lead, leg, the, trail, leg, drives, forward, at, the, knee, not, swinging, as, swinging, causes, the, trunk, to, straighten, up, and, pulls, through, to, maintain, stride, length, an, effective, trail, leg, will, be, parallel, to, the, top, of, the, hurdle, and, will, be, as, close, to, the, top, of, the, hurdle, as, possible, as, the, lead, leg, is, being, lifted, over, the, hurdle, the, opposite, arm, should, cross, the, body, parallel, to, the, ground, this, helps, with, the, runner, s, balance, and, rhythm, throughout, the, race, in, men, s, hurdles, it, is, usually, necessary, to, straighten, the, leg, at, the, top, of, the, flight, path, over, the, hurdle, although, a, partial, bend, in, the, knee, gains, a, faster, push, off, when, the, athlete, hits, the, ground, the, ability, to, do, this, depends, on, the, runner, s, leg, length, as, soon, as, the, foot, has, cleared, the, hurdle, the, knee, starts, bending, again, to, lessen, the, effect, of, a, long, slow, pendulum, in, women, s, hurdles, the, lead, leg, is, usually, straight, and, the, center, of, gravity, does, not, rise, relative, to, a, normal, running, stride, another, way, to, view, it, is, the, foot, path, shortest, path, up, and, the, shortest, path, down, the, opposite, arm, reaches, farther, forward, and, the, elbow, travels, out, to, the, side, and, then, behind, to, make, room, for, the, trailing, leg, the, trailing, leg, also, leads, with, the, knee, but, the, foot, and, knee, are, horizontal, tucked, up, as, tight, as, possible, into, the, armpit, as, soon, as, the, lead, leg, begins, its, descent, a, strong, downward, push, is, exerted, to, enable, the, trailing, leg, s, knee, to, come, up, under, the, armpit, and, in, front, of, the, chest, this, enables, the, recovery, of, some, of, the, energy, expended, in, the, flight, as, the, lead, leg, touches, down, to, the, ground, it, is, critical, that, the, runner, remains, in, a, sprint, as, soon, as, his, or, her, lead, leg, touches, down, the, trail, leg, arm, drives, the, rest, of, the, body, forward, in, the, 100, and, 110, meter, hurdle, events, the, fastest, hurdlers, use, the, three, step, technique, this, means, that, three, large, steps, are, taken, in, between, all, of, the, hurdles, in, order, to, do, this, efficiently, hurdlers, must, take, long, strides, and, maintain, their, speed, for, the, entire, race, if, a, hurdler, begins, to, slow, down, while, three, stepping, they, may, not, be, able, to, make, it, through, all, of, the, hurdles, and, may, have, to, switch, to, a, four, stepping, or, five, stepping, technique, when, three, or, five, stepping, a, hurdler, will, use, the, same, lead, leg, for, all, of, the, hurdles, if, a, hurdler, four, steps, they, will, have, to, switch, lead, legs, at, each, hurdle, a, modern, hurdle, will, fall, over, if, a, runner, hits, it, there, is, no, penalty, for, hitting, a, hurdle, provided, this, is, not, judged, deliberate, the, misconception, is, based, on, old, rules, before, the, hurdles, were, weighted, in, the, 1932, olympics, bob, tisdall, famously, won, the, olympic, gold, medal, in, the, 400, meter, hurdles, in, world, record, time, but, was, not, credited, with, the, record, due, to, knocking, over, a, hurdle, there, can, be, a, disqualification, if, a, hurdler, knocks, a, hurdle, into, an, opponent, s, lane, and, it, is, judged, to, have, interfered, with, the, opponent, s, ability, to, run, the, race, there, are, now, specifications, for, the, tipping, weight, of, a, hurdle, the, weights, need, to, be, adjusted, to, correspond, with, the, height, of, the, hurdle, so, hitting, a, hurdle, theoretically, slows, down, the, rhythm, of, the, hurdler, however, pushing, the, hurdle, with, one, s, hands, or, running, out, of, one, s, lane, as, a, result, of, hitting, the, hurdle, is, cause, for, disqualification, while, hitting, hurdles, is, not, generally, considered, desirable, a, few, sprint, hurdlers, have, succeeded, despite, knocking, over, many, hurdles, contact, with, hurdles, can, decrease, speed, and, also, result, in, disruption, of, a, hurdler, s, technique, some, coaches, suggest, if, you, lightly, kiss, the, hurdle, with, the, side, of, the, leg, closest, to, the, hurdle, it, can, help, with, the, runner, s, speed, by, keeping, the, runner, closer, to, the, ground, there, are, also, shuttle, hurdle, relay, races, although, they, are, rarely, run, they, are, usually, only, found, at, track, meets, that, consist, entirely, of, relay, races, in, a, shuttle, hurdle, relay, each, of, four, hurdlers, on, a, team, runs, the, opposite, direction, from, the, preceding, runner, the, standard, races, correspond, to, the, standard, sprint, hurdle, races, 4, 110, m, for, men, and, 4, 100, m, for, women, the, shuttle, hurdle, relay, has, a, maximum, of, only, 4, teams, since, most, tracks, only, have, 8, lanes, two, lanes, will, be, taken, up, by, one, team, the, 1, and, 3, runners, on, the, team, will, run, in, one, direction, down, one, specific, lane, and, the, 2, and, 4, runners, will, run, in, the, opposite, direction, in, the, other, lane, the, runners, on, each, team, go, in, sequence, from, 1, to, 4, instead, of, using, batons, the, runners, waiting, for, their, teammate, to, finish, must, wait, until, their, teammate, gets, to, a, certain, point, to, begin, their, part, of, the, race, there, will, be, an, official, looking, to, see, if, they, take, off, too, early, if, they, do, so, then, they, will, be, disqualified, if, they, take, off, late, then, it, will, just, hurt, their, time, and, chances, of, winning, the, event, in, the, united, states, the, men, s, team, of, aries, merritt, jason, richardson, aleec, harris, and, david, oliver, set, the, world, record, in, the, 440m, shuttle, hurdle, relay, race, at, a, time, of, 52, 94, seconds, set, on, april, 25, 2015, on, the, women, s, side, brianna, rollins, dawn, harper, nelson, queen, harrison, kristi, castlin, together, ran, a, 400m, shuttle, hurdle, race, at, a, world, record, time, of, 50, 50, seconds, on, august, 24, 2015, shuttle, hurdle, relay, was, introduced, at, the, 2019, iaaf, world, relays, it, consist, of, a, race, in, which, two, men, and, two, women, on, each, team, are, running, a, 110, m, hurdles
