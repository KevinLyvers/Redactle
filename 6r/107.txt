many, species, of, fish, are, caught, by, humans, and, consumed, as, food, in, virtually, all, regions, around, the, world, fish, has, been, an, important, dietary, source, of, protein, and, other, nutrients, the, english, language, does, not, have, a, special, culinary, name, for, food, prepared, from, fish, like, with, other, animals, as, with, pig, vs, pork, or, as, in, other, languages, such, as, spanish, pez, vs, pescado, in, culinary, and, fishery, contexts, fish, may, include, so, called, shellfish, such, as, molluscs, crustaceans, and, echinoderms, more, expansively, seafood, covers, both, fish, and, other, marine, life, used, as, food, since, 1961, the, average, annual, increase, in, global, apparent, food, fish, consumption, 3, 2, percent, has, outpaced, population, growth, 1, 6, percent, and, exceeded, consumption, of, meat, from, all, terrestrial, animals, combined, 2, 8, percent, and, individually, bovine, ovine, porcine, etc, except, poultry, 4, 9, percent, in, per, capita, terms, food, fish, consumption, has, grown, from, 9, 0, kg, 19, 8, lb, in, 1961, to, 20, 2, kg, 45, lb, in, 2015, at, an, average, rate, of, about, 1, 5, percent, per, year, the, expansion, in, consumption, has, been, driven, not, only, by, increased, production, but, also, by, a, combination, of, many, other, factors, including, reduced, wastage, better, utilization, improved, distribution, channels, and, growing, consumer, demand, linked, with, population, growth, rising, disposable, incomes, and, urbanization, europe, japan, and, the, united, states, of, america, together, accounted, for, 47, percent, of, the, world, s, total, food, fish, consumption, in, 1961, but, only, about, 20, percent, in, 2015, of, the, global, total, of, 149, million, tonnes, in, 2015, asia, consumed, more, than, two, thirds, 106, million, tonnes, at, 24, 0, kg, per, capita, oceania, and, africa, consumed, the, lowest, share, the, shift, is, the, result, of, structural, changes, in, the, sector, and, in, particular, the, growing, role, of, asian, countries, in, fish, production, as, well, as, a, significant, gap, between, the, economic, growth, rates, of, the, world, s, more, mature, fish, markets, and, those, of, many, increasingly, important, emerging, markets, around, the, world, particularly, in, asia, over, 32, 000, species, of, fish, have, been, described, making, them, the, most, diverse, group, of, vertebrates, in, addition, there, are, many, species, of, shellfish, however, only, a, small, number, of, species, are, commonly, eaten, by, humans, fish, can, be, prepared, in, a, variety, of, ways, it, can, be, served, uncooked, raw, food, e, g, sashimi, cured, by, marinating, e, g, ceviche, pickling, e, g, pickled, herring, or, smoking, e, g, smoked, salmon, or, cooked, by, baking, frying, e, g, fish, and, chips, grilling, poaching, e, g, court, bouillon, or, steaming, many, of, the, preservation, techniques, used, in, different, cultures, have, since, become, unnecessary, but, are, still, performed, for, their, resulting, taste, and, texture, when, consumed, the, british, historian, william, radcliffe, wrote, in, fishing, from, the, earliest, times, the, emperor, domitian, juvenal, iv, ordered, a, special, sitting, of, the, senate, to, deliberate, and, advise, on, a, matter, of, such, grave, state, importance, as, the, best, method, of, cooking, a, turbot, globally, fish, and, fish, products, provide, an, average, of, only, about, 34, calories, per, capita, per, day, however, more, than, as, an, energy, source, the, dietary, contribution, of, fish, is, significant, in, terms, of, high, quality, easily, digested, animal, proteins, and, especially, in, fighting, micronutrient, deficiencies, a, portion, of, 150g, of, fish, provides, about, 50, to, 60, percent, of, an, adult, s, daily, protein, requirement, fish, proteins, are, essential, in, the, diet, of, some, densely, populated, countries, where, the, total, protein, intake, is, low, and, are, particularly, important, in, diets, in, small, island, developing, states, sids, intermediate, technology, publications, wrote, in, 1992, that, fish, provides, a, good, source, of, high, quality, protein, and, contains, many, vitamins, and, minerals, it, may, be, classed, as, either, whitefish, oily, fish, or, shellfish, whitefish, such, as, haddock, and, seer, contain, very, little, fat, usually, less, than, 1, whereas, oily, fish, such, as, sardines, contain, between, 10, 25, the, latter, as, a, result, of, its, high, fat, content, contain, a, range, of, fat, soluble, vitamins, a, d, e, and, k, and, essential, fatty, acids, all, of, which, are, vital, for, the, healthy, functioning, of, the, body, eating, oily, fish, containing, long, chain, omega, 3, fatty, acids, may, reduce, systemic, inflammation, and, lower, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, eating, about, 140, grams, 4, 9, oz, of, oily, fish, rich, in, omega, 3, fatty, acids, once, per, week, is, a, recommended, consumption, amount, increasing, intake, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, may, slightly, reduce, the, risk, of, a, fatal, heart, attack, but, likely, has, little, effect, on, the, overall, number, of, deaths, from, cardiovascular, disease, fish, bone, is, the, most, common, food, related, foreign, body, to, cause, airway, obstruction, choking, on, fish, was, responsible, for, about, 4, 500, reported, accidents, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1998, a, seafood, allergy, is, a, food, allergy, to, allergens, which, can, be, present, in, fish, this, can, result, in, an, overreaction, of, the, immune, system, and, lead, to, severe, physical, symptoms, from, urticaria, to, angioedema, and, distributive, shock, allergic, reactions, can, result, from, ingesting, seafood, or, by, breathing, in, vapours, from, preparing, or, cooking, seafood, the, most, severe, allergic, reaction, is, anaphylaxis, a, medical, emergency, requiring, immediate, attention, and, is, treated, urgently, with, epinephrine, some, species, of, fish, notably, the, fugu, pufferfish, used, for, sushi, can, result, in, serious, food, poisoning, if, not, prepared, properly, these, fish, always, contain, toxins, as, a, natural, defense, against, predators, it, is, not, present, due, to, environmental, circumstances, particularly, fugu, has, a, lethal, dose, of, tetrodotoxin, in, its, internal, organs, and, must, be, prepared, by, a, licensed, fugu, chef, who, has, passed, the, national, examination, in, japan, ciguatera, poisoning, can, occur, from, eating, larger, fish, from, warm, tropical, waters, such, as, sea, bass, grouper, barracuda, and, red, snapper, scombroid, poisoning, can, result, from, eating, large, oily, fish, which, have, sat, around, for, too, long, before, being, refrigerated, or, frozen, this, includes, scombroids, such, as, tuna, and, mackerel, but, can, also, include, non, scombroids, such, as, mahi, mahi, and, amberjack, the, poison, is, often, odourless, and, tasteless, many, fish, eat, algae, and, other, organisms, that, contain, biotoxins, which, are, defensive, substances, against, predators, biotoxins, accumulated, in, fish, shellfish, include, brevetoxins, okadaic, acid, saxitoxins, ciguatoxin, and, domoic, acid, except, for, ciguatoxine, high, levels, of, these, toxins, are, only, found, in, shellfish, both, domoic, acid, and, ciguatoxine, can, be, deadly, to, humans, the, others, will, only, cause, diarrhea, dizziness, and, a, temporary, feeling, of, claustrophobia, shellfish, are, filter, feeders, and, therefore, accumulate, toxins, produced, by, microscopic, algae, such, as, dinoflagellates, and, diatoms, and, cyanobacteria, there, are, four, syndromes, called, shellfish, poisoning, which, can, result, in, humans, sea, mammals, and, seabirds, from, the, ingestion, of, toxic, shellfish, these, are, primarily, associated, with, bivalve, molluscs, such, as, mussels, clams, oysters, and, scallops, fish, like, anchovies, can, also, concentrate, toxins, such, as, domoic, acid, if, suspected, medical, attention, should, be, sought, the, toxins, responsible, for, most, shellfish, and, fish, poisonings, including, ciguatera, and, scombroid, poisoning, are, heat, resistant, to, the, point, where, conventional, cooking, methods, do, not, eliminate, them, fish, products, especially, those, from, apex, and, higher, order, consumers, up, the, food, chain, have, been, shown, to, contain, varying, amounts, of, heavy, or, toxic, metals, due, to, biomagnification, toxicity, is, a, function, of, solubility, and, insoluble, compounds, often, exhibit, negligible, toxicity, organometallic, forms, such, as, dimethyl, mercury, and, tetraethyl, lead, can, be, extremely, toxic, according, to, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, the, risk, from, mercury, by, eating, fish, and, shellfish, is, not, a, health, concern, for, most, people, however, certain, seafood, contains, sufficient, mercury, to, harm, an, unborn, baby, or, young, child, s, developing, nervous, system, the, fda, makes, three, recommendations, for, child, bearing, women, and, young, children, these, recommendations, are, also, advised, when, feeding, fish, and, shellfish, to, young, children, but, in, smaller, portions, when, the, ocean, conservation, organization, oceana, examined, over, 1, 200, seafood, samples, of, seafood, sold, in, the, u, s, between, 2010, and, 2012, they, found, one, third, were, mislabelled, the, highest, rate, of, mislabelling, occurred, with, snapper, at, 87, percent, followed, by, tuna, at, 57, percent, if, fish, and, shellfish, inhabit, polluted, waters, they, can, accumulate, other, toxic, chemicals, particularly, fat, soluble, pollutants, containing, chlorine, or, bromine, dioxins, or, pcbs, parasites, in, fish, are, a, common, natural, occurrence, though, not, a, health, concern, in, thoroughly, cooked, fish, parasites, are, a, concern, when, consumers, eat, raw, or, lightly, preserved, fish, such, as, sashimi, sushi, ceviche, and, gravlax, the, popularity, of, such, raw, fish, dishes, makes, it, important, for, consumers, to, be, aware, of, this, risk, raw, fish, should, be, frozen, to, an, internal, temperature, of, 20, c, 4, f, for, at, least, 7, days, to, kill, parasites, home, freezers, may, not, be, cold, enough, historically, fish, that, live, all, or, part, of, their, lives, in, fresh, water, were, considered, unsuitable, for, sashimi, due, to, the, possibility, of, parasites, see, sashimi, article, parasitic, infections, from, freshwater, fish, are, a, serious, problem, in, some, parts, of, the, world, particularly, southeast, asia, fish, that, spend, part, of, their, life, cycle, in, brackish, or, fresh, water, like, salmon, an, anadromous, coastalfish, closely, related, to, trout, are, a, particular, problem, a, study, in, seattle, washington, showed, that, 100, of, wild, salmon, had, roundworm, larvae, capable, of, infecting, people, in, the, same, study, farm, raised, salmon, did, not, have, any, roundworm, larvae, parasite, infection, from, raw, fish, is, rare, in, the, developed, world, fewer, than, 40, cases, per, year, in, the, united, states, and, involves, mainly, three, kinds, of, parasites, clonorchis, sinensis, a, trematode, fluke, anisakis, a, nematode, roundworm, and, diphyllobothrium, a, cestode, tapeworm, infection, risk, of, anisakis, is, particularly, high, in, fish, which, may, have, lived, in, a, river, or, estuary, such, as, salmon, sa, ke, in, japanese, cuisine, or, mackerel, sa, ba, in, japanese, cuisine, such, parasite, infections, can, generally, be, avoided, by, boiling, grilling, preserving, in, salt, or, vinegar, or, deep, freezing, in, japan, it, is, common, to, eat, raw, salmon, and, ikura, roe, but, these, foods, are, frozen, overnight, prior, to, eating, to, prevent, infections, from, parasites, particularly, anisakis, the, neologism, pescetarian, covers, those, who, eat, fish, and, other, seafood, but, not, mammals, and, birds, a, 1999, metastudy, combined, data, from, five, studies, from, western, countries, the, metastudy, reported, mortality, ratios, where, lower, numbers, indicated, fewer, deaths, for, pescetarians, to, be, 0, 82, vegetarians, to, be, 0, 84, and, occasional, meat, eaters, to, be, 0, 84, regular, meat, eaters, and, vegans, shared, the, highest, mortality, ratio, of, 1, 00, however, the, lower, mortality, was, due, largely, to, the, relatively, low, prevalence, of, smoking, in, these, cohorts, since, fish, is, animal, flesh, the, vegetarian, society, has, stated, that, vegetarian, diets, cannot, contain, fish, religious, rites, and, rituals, regarding, food, also, tend, to, classify, the, birds, of, the, air, and, the, fish, of, the, sea, separately, from, land, bound, mammals, sea, bound, mammals, are, often, treated, as, fish, under, religious, laws, as, in, jewish, dietary, law, which, forbids, the, eating, of, cetacean, meat, such, as, whale, dolphin, or, porpoise, because, they, are, not, fish, with, fins, and, scales, nor, as, mammals, do, they, chew, their, cud, and, have, cloven, hooves, as, required, by, leviticus, 11, 9, 12, jewish, kosher, practice, treats, fish, differently, from, other, animal, foods, the, distinction, between, fish, and, meat, is, codified, by, the, jewish, dietary, law, of, kashrut, regarding, the, mixing, of, milk, and, meat, which, does, not, forbid, the, mixing, of, milk, and, fish, modern, jewish, legal, practice, halakha, on, kashrut, classifies, the, flesh, of, both, mammals, and, birds, as, meat, fish, are, considered, to, be, parve, neither, meat, nor, a, dairy, food, the, preceding, portion, refers, only, to, the, halakha, of, ashkenazi, jews, sephardic, jews, do, not, mix, fish, with, dairy, ichthys, has, become, a, symbol, of, christianity, since, ancient, times, in, the, new, testament, luke, 24, jesus, s, eating, of, a, fish, and, jesus, telling, his, disciples, where, to, catch, fish, before, cooking, it, for, them, to, eat, seasonal, religious, prohibitions, against, eating, meat, do, not, usually, include, fish, for, example, non, fish, meat, was, forbidden, during, lent, and, on, all, fridays, of, the, year, in, pre, vatican, ii, roman, catholicism, but, fish, was, permitted, as, were, eggs, see, fasting, in, catholicism, in, eastern, orthodoxy, fish, is, permitted, on, some, fast, days, when, other, meat, is, forbidden, but, stricter, fast, days, also, prohibit, fish, with, spines, while, permitting, invertebrate, seafood, such, as, shrimp, and, oysters, considering, them, fish, without, blood, some, buddhists, and, hindus, brahmins, of, west, bengal, odisha, and, saraswat, brahmins, of, the, konkan, abjure, meat, that, is, not, fish, muslim, halal, practice, also, treats, fish, differently, from, other, animal, foods, as, it, can, be, eaten, without, requiring, the, ritualistic, slaughter, that, is, prescribed, for, other, halal, animals, among, the, somali, people, most, clans, have, a, taboo, against, the, consumption, of, fish, and, do, not, intermarry, with, the, few, occupational, clans, that, do, eat, it, there, are, taboos, on, eating, fish, among, many, upland, pastoralists, and, agriculturalists, and, even, some, coastal, peoples, inhabiting, parts, of, southeastern, egypt, ethiopia, eritrea, somalia, kenya, and, northern, tanzania, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, cushitic, fish, taboo, as, cushitic, speakers, are, believed, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, introduction, of, fish, avoidance, to, east, africa, though, not, all, cushitic, groups, avoid, fish, the, zone, of, the, fish, taboo, roughly, coincides, with, the, area, where, cushitic, languages, are, spoken, and, as, a, general, rule, speakers, of, nilo, saharan, and, semitic, languages, do, not, have, this, taboo, and, indeed, many, are, watermen, the, few, bantu, and, nilotic, groups, in, east, africa, that, do, practice, fish, avoidance, also, reside, in, areas, where, cushites, appear, to, have, lived, in, earlier, times, within, east, africa, the, fish, taboo, is, found, no, further, than, tanzania, this, is, attributed, to, the, local, presence, of, the, tsetse, fly, and, in, areas, beyond, which, likely, acted, as, a, barrier, to, further, southern, migrations, by, wandering, pastoralists, the, principal, fish, avoiders, zambia, and, mozambique, s, bantus, were, therefore, spared, subjugation, by, pastoral, groups, and, they, consequently, nearly, all, consume, fish, there, is, also, another, center, of, fish, avoidance, in, southern, africa, among, mainly, bantu, speakers, it, is, not, clear, whether, this, disinclination, developed, independently, or, whether, it, was, introduced, it, is, certain, however, that, no, avoidance, of, fish, occurs, among, southern, africa, s, earliest, inhabitants, the, khoisan, nevertheless, since, the, bantu, of, southern, africa, also, share, various, cultural, traits, with, the, pastoralists, further, north, in, east, africa, it, is, believed, that, at, an, unknown, date, the, taboo, against, the, consumption, of, fish, was, similarly, introduced, from, east, africa, by, cattle, herding, peoples, who, somehow, managed, to, get, their, livestock, past, the, aforementioned, tsetse, fly, endemic, regions, certain, species, of, fish, are, also, forbidden, in, judaism, such, as, the, freshwater, eel, anguillidae, and, all, species, of, catfish, although, they, live, in, water, they, appear, to, have, no, fins, or, scales, except, under, a, microscope, see, leviticus, 11, 10, 13, sunni, muslim, laws, are, more, flexible, in, this, and, catfish, and, shark, are, generally, seen, as, halal, as, they, are, special, types, of, fish, eel, is, generally, considered, permissible, in, the, four, sunni, madh, hab, but, the, ja, fari, jurisprudence, followed, by, most, shia, muslims, forbids, it, many, tribes, of, the, southwestern, united, states, including, the, navaho, apache, and, zu, i, have, a, taboo, against, fish, and, other, water, related, animals, including, waterfowl
