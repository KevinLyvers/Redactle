archery, is, the, sport, practice, or, skill, of, using, a, bow, to, shoot, arrows, the, word, comes, from, the, latin, arcus, meaning, bow, historically, archery, has, been, used, for, hunting, and, combat, in, modern, times, it, is, mainly, a, competitive, sport, and, recreational, activity, a, person, who, practices, archery, is, typically, called, an, archer, bowman, or, toxophilite, the, oldest, known, evidence, of, the, bow, and, arrow, comes, from, south, african, sites, such, as, sibudu, cave, where, the, remains, of, bone, and, stone, arrowheads, have, been, found, dating, approximately, 72, 000, to, 60, 000, years, ago, based, on, indirect, evidence, the, bow, also, seems, to, have, appeared, or, reappeared, later, in, eurasia, near, the, transition, from, the, upper, paleolithic, to, the, mesolithic, the, earliest, definite, remains, of, bow, and, arrow, from, europe, are, possible, fragments, from, germany, found, at, mannheim, vogelstang, dated, 17, 500, to, 18, 000, years, ago, and, at, stellmoor, dated, 11, 000, years, ago, azilian, points, found, in, grotte, du, bichon, switzerland, alongside, the, remains, of, both, a, bear, and, a, hunter, with, flint, fragments, found, in, the, bear, s, third, vertebra, suggest, the, use, of, arrows, at, 13, 500, years, ago, other, signs, of, its, use, in, europe, come, from, the, stellmoor, in, the, ahrensburg, valley, north, of, hamburg, germany, and, dates, from, the, late, paleolithic, about, 10, 000, 9000, bc, the, arrows, were, made, of, pine, and, consisted, of, a, main, shaft, and, a, 15, 20, cm, 5, 9, 7, 9, in, fore, shaft, with, a, flint, point, there, are, no, definite, earlier, bows, previous, pointed, shafts, are, known, but, may, have, been, launched, by, spear, throwers, rather, than, bows, the, oldest, bows, known, so, far, comes, from, the, holmeg, rd, swamp, in, denmark, at, the, site, of, nataruk, in, turkana, county, kenya, obsidian, bladelets, found, embedded, in, a, skull, and, within, the, thoracic, cavity, of, another, skeleton, suggest, the, use, of, stone, tipped, arrows, as, weapons, about, 10, 000, years, ago, bows, eventually, replaced, the, spear, thrower, as, the, predominant, means, for, launching, shafted, projectiles, on, every, continent, except, australasia, though, spear, throwers, persisted, alongside, the, bow, in, parts, of, the, americas, notably, mexico, and, among, the, inuit, bows, and, arrows, have, been, present, in, egyptian, and, neighbouring, nubian, culture, since, its, respective, predynastic, and, pre, kerma, origins, in, the, levant, artifacts, that, could, be, arrow, shaft, straighteners, are, known, from, the, natufian, culture, c, 10, 800, 8, 300, bc, onwards, the, khiamian, and, ppn, a, shouldered, khiam, points, may, well, be, arrowheads, classical, civilizations, notably, the, assyrians, greeks, armenians, persians, parthians, romans, indians, koreans, chinese, and, japanese, fielded, large, numbers, of, archers, in, their, armies, akkadians, were, the, first, to, use, composite, bows, in, war, according, to, the, victory, stele, of, naram, sin, of, akkad, egyptians, referred, to, nubia, as, ta, seti, or, the, land, of, the, bow, since, the, nubians, were, known, to, be, expert, archers, and, by, the, 16th, century, bc, egyptians, were, using, the, composite, bow, in, warfare, the, bronze, age, aegean, cultures, were, able, to, deploy, a, number, of, state, owned, specialized, bow, makers, for, warfare, and, hunting, purposes, already, from, the, 15th, century, bc, the, welsh, longbow, proved, its, worth, for, the, first, time, in, continental, warfare, at, the, battle, of, cr, cy, in, the, americas, archery, was, widespread, at, european, contact, archery, was, highly, developed, in, asia, the, sanskrit, term, for, archery, dhanurvidya, came, to, refer, to, martial, arts, in, general, in, east, asia, goguryeo, one, of, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, was, well, known, for, its, regiments, of, exceptionally, skilled, archers, the, medieval, shortbow, was, technically, identical, with, the, classical, era, bows, having, a, range, of, approximately, 91, m, 299, ft, it, was, the, primary, ranged, weapon, of, the, battlefield, through, the, early, medieval, period, around, the, tenth, century, the, crossbow, was, introduced, in, europe, crossbows, generally, had, a, longer, range, greater, accuracy, and, more, penetration, than, the, shortbow, but, suffered, from, a, much, slower, rate, of, fire, crossbows, were, used, in, the, early, crusades, with, models, having, a, range, of, 274, m, 899, ft, and, being, able, to, penetrate, armour, or, kill, a, horse, during, the, late, medieval, period, the, english, army, famously, relied, on, massed, archers, armed, with, the, longbow, the, french, army, relied, more, on, the, crossbow, like, their, predecessors, archers, were, more, likely, to, be, peasants, or, yeomen, than, men, at, arms, the, longbow, had, a, range, of, up, to, 270, m, 890, ft, however, its, lack, of, accuracy, at, long, ranges, made, it, a, mass, weapon, rather, than, an, individual, one, significant, victories, attributable, to, the, longbow, such, as, the, battle, of, crecy, and, battle, of, agincourt, resulted, in, the, english, longbow, becoming, part, of, military, lore, tribesmen, of, central, asia, after, the, domestication, of, the, horse, and, american, plains, indians, after, gaining, access, to, horses, by, europeans, became, extremely, adept, at, archery, on, horseback, lightly, armoured, but, highly, mobile, archers, were, excellently, suited, to, warfare, in, the, central, asian, steppes, and, they, formed, a, large, part, of, armies, that, repeatedly, conquered, large, areas, of, eurasia, shorter, bows, are, more, suited, to, use, on, horseback, and, the, composite, bow, enabled, mounted, archers, to, use, powerful, weapons, seljuk, turks, used, mounted, archers, against, the, european, first, crusade, especially, at, the, battle, of, dorylaeum, 1097, their, tactic, was, to, shoot, at, the, enemy, infantry, and, use, their, superior, mobility, to, prevent, the, enemy, from, closing, with, them, empires, throughout, the, eurasian, landmass, often, strongly, associated, their, respective, barbarian, counterparts, with, the, usage, of, the, bow, and, arrow, to, the, point, where, powerful, states, like, the, han, dynasty, referred, to, their, neighbours, the, xiong, nu, as, those, who, draw, the, bow, for, example, xiong, nu, mounted, bowmen, made, them, more, than, a, match, for, the, han, military, and, their, threat, was, at, least, partially, responsible, for, chinese, expansion, into, the, ordos, region, to, create, a, stronger, more, powerful, buffer, zone, against, them, it, is, possible, that, barbarian, peoples, were, responsible, for, introducing, archery, or, certain, types, of, bows, to, their, civilized, counterparts, the, xiong, nu, and, the, han, being, one, example, similarly, short, bows, seem, to, have, been, introduced, to, japan, by, northeast, asian, groups, the, development, of, firearms, rendered, the, bow, and, arrow, obsolete, in, warfare, although, efforts, were, sometimes, made, to, preserve, archery, practice, in, england, and, wales, for, example, the, government, tried, to, enforce, practice, with, the, longbow, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, this, was, because, it, was, recognized, that, the, bow, had, been, instrumental, to, military, success, during, the, hundred, years, war, despite, the, high, social, status, ongoing, utility, and, widespread, pleasure, of, archery, in, armenia, china, egypt, england, and, wales, the, americas, india, japan, korea, turkey, and, elsewhere, almost, every, culture, that, gained, access, to, even, early, firearms, used, them, widely, to, the, neglect, of, archery, early, firearms, were, inferior, in, rate, of, fire, and, were, very, sensitive, to, wet, weather, however, they, had, longer, effective, range, and, were, tactically, superior, in, the, common, situation, of, soldiers, shooting, at, each, other, from, behind, obstructions, they, also, required, significantly, less, training, to, use, properly, in, particular, penetrating, steel, armor, without, any, need, to, develop, special, musculature, armies, equipped, with, guns, could, thus, provide, superior, firepower, and, highly, trained, archers, became, obsolete, on, the, battlefield, however, the, bow, and, arrow, is, still, an, effective, weapon, and, archers, have, seen, military, action, in, the, 21st, century, traditional, archery, remains, in, use, for, sport, and, for, hunting, in, many, areas, early, recreational, archery, societies, included, the, finsbury, archers, and, the, ancient, society, of, kilwinning, archers, the, latter, s, annual, papingo, event, was, first, recorded, in, 1483, in, this, event, archers, shoot, vertically, from, the, base, of, an, abbey, tower, to, dislodge, a, wood, pigeon, placed, approximately, 30, m, 98, ft, above, the, royal, company, of, archers, was, formed, in, 1676, and, is, one, of, the, oldest, sporting, bodies, in, the, world, archery, remained, a, small, and, scattered, pastime, however, until, the, late, 18th, century, when, it, experienced, a, fashionable, revival, among, the, aristocracy, sir, ashton, lever, an, antiquarian, and, collector, formed, the, toxophilite, society, in, london, in, 1781, with, the, patronage, of, george, the, prince, of, wales, archery, societies, were, set, up, across, the, country, each, with, its, own, strict, entry, criteria, and, outlandish, costumes, recreational, archery, soon, became, extravagant, social, and, ceremonial, events, for, the, nobility, complete, with, flags, music, and, 21, gun, salutes, for, the, competitors, the, clubs, were, the, drawing, rooms, of, the, great, country, houses, placed, outside, and, thus, came, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, social, networks, of, the, local, upper, class, as, well, as, its, emphasis, on, display, and, status, the, sport, was, notable, for, its, popularity, with, females, young, women, could, not, only, compete, in, the, contests, but, retain, and, show, off, their, sexuality, while, doing, so, thus, archery, came, to, act, as, a, forum, for, introductions, flirtation, and, romance, it, was, often, consciously, styled, in, the, manner, of, a, medieval, tournament, with, titles, and, laurel, wreaths, being, presented, as, a, reward, to, the, victor, general, meetings, were, held, from, 1789, in, which, local, lodges, convened, together, to, standardise, the, rules, and, ceremonies, archery, was, also, co, opted, as, a, distinctively, british, tradition, dating, back, to, the, lore, of, robin, hood, and, it, served, as, a, patriotic, form, of, entertainment, at, a, time, of, political, tension, in, europe, the, societies, were, also, elitist, and, the, new, middle, class, bourgeoisie, were, excluded, from, the, clubs, due, to, their, lack, of, social, status, after, the, napoleonic, wars, the, sport, became, increasingly, popular, among, all, classes, and, it, was, framed, as, a, nostalgic, reimagining, of, the, preindustrial, rural, britain, particularly, influential, was, sir, walter, scott, s, 1819, novel, ivanhoe, that, depicted, the, heroic, character, lockseley, winning, an, archery, tournament, the, 1840s, saw, the, second, attempts, at, turning, the, recreation, into, a, modern, sport, the, first, grand, national, archery, society, meeting, was, held, in, york, in, 1844, and, over, the, next, decade, the, extravagant, and, festive, practices, of, the, past, were, gradually, whittled, away, and, the, rules, were, standardized, as, the, york, round, a, series, of, shoots, at, 55, m, 180, ft, 73, m, 240, ft, and, 91, m, 299, ft, horace, a, ford, helped, to, improve, archery, standards, and, pioneered, new, archery, techniques, he, won, the, grand, national, 11, times, in, a, row, and, published, a, highly, influential, guide, to, the, sport, in, 1856, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, sport, experienced, declining, participation, as, alternative, sports, such, as, croquet, and, tennis, became, more, popular, among, the, middle, class, by, 1889, just, 50, archery, clubs, were, left, in, britain, but, it, was, still, included, as, a, sport, at, the, 1900, paris, olympics, the, national, archery, association, of, the, united, states, was, organized, in, 1879, in, part, by, maurice, thompson, the, author, of, the, seminal, text, the, witchery, of, archery, and, his, brother, will, thompson, maurice, was, president, in, its, inaugural, year, and, will, was, president, in, 1882, 1903, and, 1904, the, 1910, president, was, frank, e, canfield, today, it, is, known, as, usa, archery, and, is, recognized, by, united, states, olympic, paralympic, committee, in, the, united, states, primitive, archery, was, revived, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, last, of, the, yahi, indian, tribe, a, native, known, as, ishi, came, out, of, hiding, in, california, in, 1911, his, doctor, saxton, pope, learned, many, of, ishi, s, traditional, archery, skills, and, popularized, them, the, pope, and, young, club, founded, in, 1961, and, named, in, honor, of, pope, and, his, friend, arthur, young, became, one, of, north, america, s, leading, bowhunting, and, conservation, organizations, founded, as, a, nonprofit, scientific, organization, the, club, was, patterned, after, the, prestigious, boone, and, crockett, club, and, advocated, responsible, bowhunting, by, promoting, quality, fair, chase, hunting, and, sound, conservation, practices, from, the, 1920s, professional, engineers, took, an, interest, in, archery, previously, the, exclusive, field, of, traditional, craft, experts, they, led, the, commercial, development, of, new, forms, of, bow, including, the, modern, recurve, and, compound, bow, these, modern, forms, are, now, dominant, in, modern, western, archery, traditional, bows, are, in, a, minority, archery, returned, to, the, olympics, in, 1972, in, the, 1980s, the, skills, of, traditional, archery, were, revived, by, american, enthusiasts, and, combined, with, the, new, scientific, understanding, much, of, this, expertise, is, available, in, the, traditional, bowyer, s, bibles, see, further, reading, modern, game, archery, owes, much, of, its, success, to, fred, bear, an, american, bow, hunter, and, bow, manufacturer, in, 2021, five, people, were, killed, and, three, injured, by, an, archer, in, norway, in, the, kongsberg, attack, deities, and, heroes, in, several, mythologies, are, described, as, archers, including, the, greek, artemis, and, apollo, the, roman, diana, and, cupid, the, germanic, agilaz, continuing, in, legends, like, those, of, wilhelm, tell, palnetoke, or, robin, hood, armenian, hayk, and, babylonian, marduk, indian, karna, also, known, as, radheya,

and, then, bests, the, suitors, in, an, archery, competition, after, hinting, at, his, identity, by, stringing, and, drawing, his, great, bow, that, only, he, can, draw, a, similar, motif, is, present, in, the, turkic, iranian, heroic, archeheroic, poem, alpamysh, the, nymphai, hyperboreioi, were, worshipped, on, the, greek, island, of, delos, as, attendants, of, artemis, presiding, over, aspects, of, archery, hekaerge, represented, distancing, loxo, trajectory, and, oupis, aim, yi, the, archer, and, his, apprentice, feng, meng, appear, in, several, early, chinese, myths, and, the, historical, character, of, zhou, tong, features, in, many, fictional, forms, jumong, the, first, taewang, of, the, goguryeo, kingdom, of, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, is, claimed, by, legend, to, have, been, a, near, godlike, archer, archery, features, in, the, story, of, oguz, khagan, similarly, archery, and, the, bow, feature, heavily, into, historical, korean, identity, in, west, african, yoruba, belief, osoosi, is, one, of, several, deities, of, the, hunt, who, are, identified, with, bow, and, arrow, iconography, and, other, insignia, associated, with, archery, while, there, is, great, variety, in, the, construction, details, of, bows, both, historical, and, modern, all, bows, consist, of, a, string, attached, to, elastic, limbs, that, store, mechanical, energy, imparted, by, the, user, drawing, the, string, bows, may, be, broadly, split, into, two, categories, those, drawn, by, pulling, the, string, directly, and, those, that, use, a, mechanism, to, pull, the, string, directly, drawn, bows, may, be, further, divided, based, upon, differences, in, the, method, of, limb, construction, notable, examples, being, self, bows, laminated, bows, and, composite, bows, bows, can, also, be, classified, by, the, bow, shape, of, the, limbs, when, unstrung, in, contrast, to, traditional, european, straight, bows, a, recurve, bow, and, some, types, of, longbow, have, tips, that, curve, away, from, the, archer, when, the, bow, is, unstrung, the, cross, section, of, the, limb, also, varies, the, classic, longbow, is, a, tall, bow, with, narrow, limbs, that, are, d, shaped, in, cross, section, and, the, flatbow, has, flat, wide, limbs, that, are, approximately, rectangular, in, cross, section, cable, backed, bows, use, cords, as, the, back, of, the, bow, the, draw, weight, of, the, bow, can, be, adjusted, by, changing, the, tension, of, the, cable, they, were, widespread, among, inuit, who, lacked, easy, access, to, good, bow, wood, one, variety, of, cable, backed, bow, is, the, penobscot, bow, or, wabenaki, bow, invented, by, frank, loring, chief, big, thunder, about, 1900, it, consists, of, a, small, bow, attached, by, cables, on, the, back, of, a, larger, main, bow, in, different, cultures, the, arrows, are, released, from, either, the, left, or, right, side, of, the, bow, and, this, affects, the, hand, grip, and, position, of, the, bow, in, arab, archery, turkish, archery, and, japanese, archery, the, arrows, are, released, from, the, right, hand, side, of, the, bow, and, this, affects, construction, of, the, bow, in, western, archery, the, arrow, is, usually, released, from, the, left, hand, side, of, the, bow, for, a, right, handed, archer, compound, bows, are, designed, to, reduce, the, force, required, to, hold, the, string, at, full, draw, hence, allowing, the, archer, more, time, to, aim, with, less, muscular, stress, most, compound, designs, use, cams, or, elliptical, wheels, on, the, ends, of, the, limbs, to, achieve, this, a, typical, let, off, is, anywhere, from, 65, to, 80, for, example, a, 27, kg, 60, lb, bow, with, 80, let, off, only, requires, 53, n, 12, lb, f, to, hold, at, full, draw, up, to, 99, let, off, is, possible, the, compound, bow, was, invented, by, holless, wilbur, allen, in, the, 1960s, a, us, patent, was, filed, in, 1966, and, granted, in, 1969, and, it, has, become, the, most, widely, used, type, of, bow, for, all, forms, of, archery, in, north, america, mechanically, drawn, bows, typically, have, a, stock, or, other, mounting, such, as, the, crossbow, crossbows, typically, have, shorter, draw, lengths, compared, to, compound, bows, because, of, this, heavier, draw, weights, are, required, to, achieve, the, same, energy, transfer, to, the, arrow, these, mechanically, drawn, bows, also, have, devices, to, hold, the, tension, when, the, bow, is, fully, drawn, they, are, not, limited, by, the, strength, of, a, single, archer, and, larger, varieties, have, been, used, as, siege, engines, the, most, common, form, of, arrow, consists, of, a, shaft, with, an, arrowhead, at, the, front, end, and, fletchings, and, a, nock, at, the, other, end, arrows, across, time, and, history, have, normally, been, carried, in, a, container, known, as, a, quiver, which, can, take, many, different, forms, shafts, of, arrows, are, typically, composed, of, solid, wood, bamboo, fiberglass, aluminium, alloy, carbon, fiber, or, composite, materials, wooden, arrows, are, prone, to, warping, fiberglass, arrows, are, brittle, but, can, be, produced, to, uniform, specifications, easily, aluminium, shafts, were, a, very, popular, high, performance, choice, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, due, to, their, straightness, lighter, weight, and, subsequently, higher, speed, and, flatter, trajectories, carbon, fiber, arrows, became, popular, in, the, 1990s, because, they, are, very, light, flying, even, faster, and, flatter, than, aluminium, arrows, today, the, most, popular, arrows, at, tournaments, and, olympic, events, are, made, of, composite, materials, the, arrowhead, is, the, primary, functional, component, of, the, arrow, some, arrows, may, simply, use, a, sharpened, tip, of, the, solid, shaft, but, separate, arrowheads, are, far, more, common, usually, made, from, metal, stone, or, other, hard, materials, the, most, commonly, used, forms, are, target, points, field, points, and, broadheads, although, there, are, also, other, types, such, as, bodkin, judo, and, blunt, heads, fletching, is, traditionally, made, from, bird, feathers, but, solid, plastic, vanes, and, thin, sheet, like, spin, vanes, are, used, they, are, attached, near, the, nock, rear, end, of, the, arrow, with, thin, double, sided, tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew, the, most, common, configuration, in, all, cultures, is, three, fletches, though, as, many, as, six, have, been, used, two, makes, the, arrow, unstable, in, flight, when, the, arrow, is, three, fletched, the, fletches, are, equally, spaced, around, the, shaft, with, one, placed, such, that, it, is, perpendicular, to, the, bow, when, nocked, on, the, string, though, variations, are, seen, with, modern, equipment, especially, when, using, the, modern, spin, vanes, this, fletch, is, called, the, index, fletch, or, cock, feather, also, known, as, the, odd, vane, out, or, the, nocking, vane, and, the, others, are, sometimes, called, the, hen, feathers, commonly, the, cock, feather, is, of, a, different, color, however, if, archers, are, using, fletching, made, of, feather, or, similar, material, they, may, use, same, color, vanes, as, different, dyes, can, give, varying, stiffness, to, vanes, resulting, in, less, precision, when, an, arrow, is, four, fletched, two, opposing, fletches, are, often, cock, feathers, and, occasionally, the, fletches, are, not, evenly, spaced, the, fletching, may, be, either, parabolic, cut, short, feathers, in, a, smooth, parabolic, curve, or, shield, cut, generally, shaped, like, half, of, a, narrow, shield, and, is, often, attached, at, an, angle, known, as, helical, fletching, to, introduce, a, stabilizing, spin, to, the, arrow, while, in, flight, whether, helical, or, straight, fletched, when, natural, fletching, bird, feathers, is, used, it, is, critical, that, all, feathers, come, from, the, same, side, of, the, bird, oversized, fletchings, can, be, used, to, accentuate, drag, and, thus, limit, the, range, of, the, arrow, significantly, these, arrows, are, called, flu, flus, misplacement, of, fletchings, can, change, the, arrow, s, flight, path, dramatically, dacron, and, other, modern, materials, offer, high, strength, for, their, weight, and, are, used, on, most, modern, bows, linen, and, other, traditional, materials, are, still, used, on, traditional, bows, several, modern, methods, of, making, a, bowstring, exist, such, as, the, endless, loop, and, flemish, twist, almost, any, fiber, can, be, made, into, a, bowstring, the, author, of, arab, archery, suggests, the, hide, of, a, young, emaciated, camel, nj, l, s, saga, describes, the, refusal, of, a, wife, hallger, ur, to, cut, her, hair, to, make, an, emergency, bowstring, for, her, husband, gunnar, h, mundarson, who, is, then, killed, most, modern, archers, wear, a, bracer, also, known, as, an, arm, guard, to, protect, the, inside, of, the, bow, arm, from, being, hit, by, the, string, and, prevent, clothing, from, catching, the, bowstring, the, bracer, does, not, brace, the, arm, the, word, comes, from, the, armoury, term, brassard, meaning, an, armoured, sleeve, or, badge, the, navajo, people, have, developed, highly, ornamented, bracers, as, non, functional, items, of, adornment, some, archers, nearly, all, female, archers, wear, protection, on, their, chests, called, chestguards, or, plastrons, the, myth, of, the, amazons, was, that, they, had, one, breast, removed, to, solve, this, problem, roger, ascham, mentions, one, archer, presumably, with, an, unusual, shooting, style, who, wore, a, leather, guard, for, his, face, the, drawing, digits, are, normally, protected, by, a, leather, tab, glove, or, thumb, ring, a, simple, tab, of, leather, is, commonly, used, as, is, a, skeleton, glove, medieval, europeans, probably, used, a, complete, leather, glove, eurasiatic, archers, who, used, the, thumb, or, mongolian, draw, protected, their, thumbs, usually, with, leather, according, to, the, author, of, arab, archery, but, also, with, special, rings, of, various, hard, materials, many, surviving, turkish, and, chinese, examples, are, works, of, considerable, art, some, are, so, highly, ornamented, that, the, users, could, not, have, used, them, to, loose, an, arrow, possibly, these, were, items, of, personal, adornment, and, hence, value, remaining, extant, whilst, leather, had, virtually, no, intrinsic, value, and, would, also, deteriorate, with, time, in, traditional, japanese, archery, a, special, glove, is, used, that, has, a, ridge, to, assist, in, drawing, the, string, a, release, aid, is, a, mechanical, device, designed, to, give, a, crisp, and, precise, loose, of, arrows, from, a, compound, bow, in, the, most, commonly, used, the, string, is, released, by, a, finger, operated, trigger, mechanism, held, in, the, archer, s, hand, or, attached, to, their, wrist, in, another, type, known, as, a, back, tension, release, the, string, is, automatically, released, when, drawn, to, a, pre, determined, tension, stabilizers, are, mounted, at, various, points, on, the, bow, common, with, competitive, archery, equipment, are, special, brackets, that, allow, multiple, stabilizers, to, be, mounted, at, various, angles, to, fine, tune, the, bow, s, balance, stabilizers, aid, in, aiming, by, improving, the, balance, of, the, bow, sights, quivers, rests, and, design, of, the, riser, the, central, non, bending, part, of, the, bow, make, one, side, of, the, bow, heavier, one, purpose, of, stabilizers, are, to, offset, these, forces, a, reflex, riser, design, will, cause, the, top, limb, to, lean, towards, the, shooter, in, this, case, a, heavier, front, stabilizer, is, desired, to, offset, this, action, a, deflex, riser, design, has, the, opposite, effect, and, a, lighter, front, stabilizer, may, be, used, stabilizers, can, reduce, noise, and, vibration, these, energies, are, absorbed, by, viscoelastic, polymers, gels, powders, and, other, materials, used, to, build, stabilizers, stabilizers, improve, the, forgiveness, and, accuracy, by, increasing, the, moment, of, inertia, of, the, bow, to, resist, movement, during, the, shooting, process, lightweight, carbon, stabilizers, with, weighted, ends, are, desirable, because, they, improve, the, moment, of, inertia, while, minimizing, the, weight, added, the, standard, convention, on, teaching, archery, is, to, hold, the, bow, depending, upon, eye, dominance, one, exception, is, in, modern, ky, d, where, all, archers, are, trained, to, hold, the, bow, in, the, left, hand, therefore, if, one, is, right, eye, dominant, they, would, hold, the, bow, in, the, left, hand, and, draw, the, string, with, the, right, hand, however, not, everyone, agrees, with, this, line, of, thought, a, smoother, and, more, fluid, release, of, the, string, will, produce, the, most, consistently, repeatable, shots, and, therefore, may, provide, greater, accuracy, of, the, arrow, flight, some, believe, that, the, hand, with, the, greatest, dexterity, should, therefore, be, the, hand, that, draws, and, releases, the, string, either, eye, can, be, used, for, aiming, and, the, less, dominant, eye, can, be, trained, over, time, to, become, more, effective, for, use, to, assist, with, this, an, eye, patch, can, be, temporarily, worn, over, the, dominant, eye, the, hand, that, holds, the, bow, is, referred, to, as, the, bow, hand, and, its, arm, the, bow, arm, the, opposite, hand, is, called, the, drawing, hand, or, string, hand, terms, such, as, bow, shoulder, or, string, elbow, follow, the, same, convention, if, shooting, according, to, eye, dominance, right, eye, dominant, archers, shooting, conventionally, hold, the, bow, with, their, left, hand, if, shooting, according, to, hand, dexterity, the, archer, draws, the, string, with, the, hand, that, possesses, the, greatest, dexterity, regardless, of, eye, dominance, to, shoot, an, arrow, an, archer, first, assumes, the, correct, stance, the, body, should, be, at, or, nearly, perpendicular, to, the, target, and, the, shooting, line, with, the, feet, placed, shoulder, width, apart, as, an, archer, progresses, from, beginner, to, a, more, advanced, level, other, stances, such, as, the, open, stance, or, the, closed, stance, may, be, used, although, many, choose, to, stick, with, a, neutral, stance, each, archer, has, a, particular, preference, but, mostly, this, term, indicates, that, the, leg, furthest, from, the, shooting, line, is, a, half, to, a, whole, foot, length, from, the, other, foot, on, the, ground, to, load, the, bow, is, pointed, toward, the, ground, tipped, slightly, clockwise, of, vertical, for, a, right, handed, shooter, and, the, shaft, of, the, arrow, is, placed, on, the, arrow, rest, or, shelf, the, back, of, the, arrow, is, attached, to, the, bowstring, with, the, nock, a, small, locking, groove, located, at, the, proximal, end, of, the, arrow, this, step, is, called, nocking, the, arrow, typical, arrows, with, three, vanes, should, be, oriented, such, that, a, single, vane, the, cock, feather, is, pointing, away, from, the, bow, to, improve, the, clearance, of, the, arrow, as, it, passes, the, arrow, rest, a, compound, bow, is, fitted, with, a, special, type, of, arrow, rest, known, as, a, launcher, and, the, arrow, is, usually, loaded, with, the, cock, feather, vane, pointed, either, up, or, down, depending, upon, the, type, of, launcher, being, used, the, bowstring, and, arrow, are, held, with, three, fingers, or, with, a, mechanical, arrow, release, most, commonly, for, finger, shooters, the, index, finger, is, placed, above, the, arrow, and, the, next, two, fingers, below, although, several, other, techniques, have, their, adherents, around, the, world, involving, three, fingers, below, the, arrow, or, an, arrow, pinching, technique, instinctive, shooting, is, a, technique, eschewing, sights, and, is, often, preferred, by, traditional, archers, shooters, of, longbows, and, recurves, in, either, the, split, finger, or, three, finger, under, case, the, string, is, usually, placed, in, the, first, or, second, joint, or, else, on, the, pads, of, the, fingers, when, using, a, mechanical, release, aid, the, release, is, hooked, onto, the, d, loop, another, type, of, string, hold, used, on, traditional, bows, is, the, type, favoured, by, the, mongol, warriors, known, as, the, thumb, release, style, this, involves, using, the, thumb, to, draw, the, string, with, the, fingers, curling, around, the, thumb, to, add, some, support, to, release, the, string, the, fingers, are, opened, out, and, the, thumb, relaxes, to, allow, the, string, to, slide, off, the, thumb, when, using, this, type, of, release, the, arrow, should, rest, on, the, same, side, of, the, bow, as, the, drawing, hand, i, e, left, hand, draw, arrow, on, left, side, of, bow, the, archer, then, raises, the, bow, and, draws, the, string, with, varying, alignments, for, vertical, versus, slightly, canted, bow, positions, this, is, often, one, fluid, motion, for, shooters, of, recurves, and, longbows, which, tend, to, vary, from, archer, to, archer, compound, shooters, often, experience, a, slight, jerk, during, the, drawback, at, around, the, last, 4, cm, 1, 6, in, where, the, draw, weight, is, at, its, maximum, before, relaxing, into, a, comfortable, stable, full, draw, position, the, archer, draws, the, string, hand, towards, the, face, where, it, should, rest, lightly, at, a, fixed, anchor, point, this, point, is, consistent, from, shot, to, shot, and, is, usually, at, the, corner, of, the, mouth, on, the, chin, to, the, cheek, or, to, the, ear, depending, on, preferred, shooting, style, the, archer, holds, the, bow, arm, outwards, toward, the, target, the, elbow, of, this, arm, should, be, rotated, so, that, the, inner, elbow, is, perpendicular, to, the, ground, though, archers, with, hyper, extendable, elbows, tend, to, angle, the, inner, elbow, toward, the, ground, as, exemplified, by, the, korean, archer, jang, yong, ho, this, keeps, the, forearm, out, of, the, way, of, the, bowstring, in, modern, form, the, archer, stands, erect, forming, a, t, the, archer, s, lower, trapezius, muscles, are, used, to, pull, the, arrow, to, the, anchor, point, some, modern, recurve, bows, are, equipped, with, a, mechanical, device, called, a, clicker, which, produces, a, clicking, sound, when, the, archer, reaches, the, correct, draw, length, traditional, english, longbow, shooters, step, into, the, bow, exerting, force, with, both, the, bow, arm, and, the, string, hand, arm, simultaneously, especially, when, using, bows, having, draw, weights, from, 45, kg, 99, lb, to, over, 80, kg, 180, lb, heavily, stacked, traditional, bows, recurves, long, bows, and, the, like, are, released, immediately, upon, reaching, full, draw, at, maximum, weight, whereas, compound, bows, reach, their, maximum, weight, around, the, last, 4, cm, 1, 6, in, dropping, holding, weight, significantly, at, full, draw, compound, bows, are, often, held, at, full, draw, for, a, short, time, to, achieve, maximum, accuracy, the, arrow, is, typically, released, by, relaxing, the, fingers, of, the, drawing, hand, see, bow, draw, or, triggering, the, mechanical, release, aid, usually, the, release, aims, to, keep, the, drawing, arm, rigid, the, bow, hand, relaxed, and, the, arrow, is, moved, back, using, the, back, muscles, as, opposed, to, using, just, arm, motions, an, archer, should, also, pay, attention, to, the, recoil, or, follow, through, of, his, or, her, body, as, it, may, indicate, problems, with, form, technique, that, affect, accuracy, there, are, two, main, forms, of, aiming, in, archery, using, a, mechanical, or, fixed, sight, or, barebow, mechanical, sights, can, be, affixed, to, the, bow, to, aid, in, aiming, they, can, be, as, simple, as, a, pin, or, may, use, optics, with, magnification, modern, compound, bows, usually, also, have, a, peep, sight, rear, sight, built, into, the, string, which, aids, in, a, consistent, anchor, point, but, this, is, not, allowed, for, other, bow, types, under, world, archery, modern, compound, bows, automatically, limit, the, draw, length, to, give, a, consistent, arrow, velocity, while, traditional, bows, allow, great, variation, in, draw, length, some, bows, use, mechanical, methods, to, make, the, draw, length, consistent, barebow, archers, often, use, a, sight, picture, which, includes, the, target, the, bow, the, hand, the, arrow, shaft, and, the, arrow, tip, as, seen, at, the, same, time, by, the, archer, with, a, fixed, anchor, point, where, the, string, is, brought, to, or, close, to, the, face, and, a, fully, extended, bow, arm, successive, shots, taken, with, the, sight, picture, in, the, same, position, fall, on, the, same, point, this, lets, the, archer, adjust, aim, with, successive, shots, to, achieve, accuracy, modern, archery, equipment, usually, includes, sights, instinctive, aiming, is, used, by, many, archers, who, use, traditional, bows, the, two, most, common, forms, of, a, non, mechanical, release, are, split, finger, and, three, under, split, finger, aiming, requires, the, archer, to, place, the, index, finger, above, the, nocked, arrow, while, the, middle, and, ring, fingers, are, both, placed, below, three, under, aiming, places, the, index, middle, and, ring, fingers, under, the, nocked, arrow, this, technique, allows, the, archer, to, better, look, down, the, arrow, since, the, back, of, the, arrow, is, closer, to, the, dominant, eye, and, is, commonly, called, gun, barreling, referring, to, common, aiming, techniques, used, with, firearms, when, using, short, bows, or, shooting, from, horseback, it, is, difficult, to, use, the, sight, picture, the, archer, may, look, at, the, target, but, without, including, the, weapon, in, the, field, of, accurate, view, aiming, then, involves, hand, eye, coordination, which, includes, proprioception, and, motor, muscle, memory, similar, to, that, used, when, throwing, a, ball, with, sufficient, practice, such, archers, can, normally, achieve, good, practical, accuracy, for, hunting, or, for, war, aiming, without, a, sight, picture, may, allow, more, rapid, shooting, not, however, increasing, accuracy, instinctive, shooting, is, a, style, of, shooting, that, includes, the, barebow, aiming, method, that, relies, heavily, upon, the, subconscious, mind, proprioception, and, motor, muscle, memory, to, make, aiming, adjustments, the, term, used, to, refer, to, a, general, category, of, archers, who, did, not, use, a, mechanical, or, fixed, sight, in, other, words, it, is, shooting, by, feel, gap, shooting, is, an, aiming, method, used, by, instinctive, shooters, it, involves, consciously, focusing, on, the, tip, of, the, arrow, while, maintaining, awareness, of, the, target, the, archer, must, adjust, the, arrow, s, trajectory, by, gauging, the, distance, between, the, arrow, tip, and, the, target, ensuring, accurate, shots, when, a, projectile, is, thrown, by, hand, the, speed, of, the, projectile, is, determined, by, the, kinetic, energy, imparted, by, the, thrower, s, muscles, performing, work, however, the, energy, must, be, imparted, over, a, limited, distance, determined, by, arm, length, and, therefore, because, the, projectile, is, accelerating, over, a, limited, time, so, the, limiting, factor, is, not, work, but, rather, power, which, determines, how, much, energy, can, be, added, in, the, limited, time, available, power, generated, by, muscles, however, is, limited, by, force, velocity, relationship, and, even, at, the, optimal, contraction, speed, for, power, production, total, work, by, the, muscle, is, less, than, half, of, what, it, would, be, if, the, muscle, contracted, over, the, same, distance, at, slow, speeds, resulting, in, less, than, 1, 4, the, projectile, launch, velocity, possible, without, the, limitations, of, the, force, velocity, relationship, when, a, bow, is, used, the, muscles, are, able, to, perform, work, much, more, slowly, resulting, in, greater, force, and, greater, work, done, this, work, is, stored, in, the, bow, as, elastic, potential, energy, and, when, the, bowstring, is, released, this, stored, energy, is, imparted, to, the, arrow, much, more, quickly, than, can, be, delivered, by, the, muscles, resulting, in, much, higher, velocity, and, hence, greater, distance, this, same, process, is, employed, by, frogs, which, use, elastic, tendons, to, increase, jumping, distance, in, archery, some, energy, dissipates, through, elastic, hysteresis, reducing, the, overall, amount, released, when, the, bow, is, shot, of, the, remaining, energy, some, is, dampened, both, by, the, limbs, of, the, bow, and, the, bowstring, depending, on, the, arrow, s, elasticity, some, of, the, energy, is, also, absorbed, by, compressing, the, arrow, primarily, because, the, release, of, the, bowstring, is, rarely, in, line, with, the, arrow, shaft, causing, it, to, flex, out, to, one, side, this, is, because, the, bowstring, accelerates, faster, than, the, archer, s, fingers, can, open, and, consequently, some, sideways, motion, is, imparted, to, the, string, and, hence, arrow, nock, as, the, power, and, speed, of, the, bow, pulls, the, string, off, the, opening, fingers, even, with, a, release, aid, mechanism, some, of, this, effect, is, usually, experienced, since, the, string, always, accelerates, faster, than, the, retaining, part, of, the, mechanism, this, makes, the, arrow, oscillate, in, flight, its, center, flexing, to, one, side, and, then, the, other, repeatedly, gradually, reducing, as, the, arrow, s, flight, proceeds, this, is, clearly, visible, in, high, speed, photography, of, arrows, at, discharge, a, direct, effect, of, these, energy, transfers, can, clearly, be, seen, when, dry, firing, dry, firing, refers, to, releasing, the, bowstring, without, a, nocked, arrow, because, there, is, no, arrow, to, receive, the, stored, potential, energy, almost, all, the, energy, stays, in, the, bow, some, have, suggested, that, dry, firing, may, cause, physical, damage, to, the, bow, such, as, cracks, and, fractures, and, because, most, bows, are, not, specifically, made, to, handle, the, high, amounts, of, energy, dry, firing, produces, should, never, be, done, modern, arrows, are, made, to, a, specified, spine, or, stiffness, rating, to, maintain, matched, flexing, and, hence, accuracy, of, aim, this, flexing, can, be, a, desirable, feature, since, when, the, spine, of, the, shaft, is, matched, to, the, acceleration, of, the, bow, string, the, arrow, bends, or, flexes, around, the, bow, and, any, arrow, rest, and, consequently, the, arrow, and, fletchings, have, an, un, impeded, flight, this, feature, is, known, as, the, archer, s, paradox, it, maintains, accuracy, for, if, part, of, the, arrow, struck, a, glancing, blow, on, discharge, some, inconsistency, would, be, present, and, the, excellent, accuracy, of, modern, equipment, would, not, be, achieved, the, accurate, flight, of, an, arrow, depends, on, its, fletchings, the, arrow, s, manufacturer, a, fletcher, can, arrange, fletching, to, cause, the, arrow, to, rotate, along, its, axis, this, improves, accuracy, by, evening, pressure, buildups, that, would, otherwise, cause, the, arrow, to, plane, on, the, air, in, a, random, direction, after, shooting, even, with, a, carefully, made, arrow, the, slightest, imperfection, or, air, movement, causes, some, unbalanced, turbulence, in, air, flow, consequently, rotation, creates, an, equalization, of, such, turbulence, which, overall, maintains, the, intended, direction, of, flight, i, e, accuracy, this, rotation, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, rapid, gyroscopic, rotation, of, a, rifle, bullet, fletching, that, is, not, arranged, to, induce, rotation, still, improves, accuracy, by, causing, a, restoring, drag, any, time, the, arrow, tilts, from, its, intended, direction, of, travel, the, innovative, aspect, of, the, invention, of, the, bow, and, arrow, was, the, amount, of, power, delivered, to, an, extremely, small, area, by, the, arrow, the, huge, ratio, of, length, vs, cross, sectional, area, coupled, with, velocity, made, the, arrow, more, powerful, than, any, other, hand, held, weapon, until, firearms, were, invented, arrows, can, spread, or, concentrate, force, depending, on, the, application, practice, arrows, for, instance, have, a, blunt, tip, that, spreads, the, force, over, a, wider, area, to, reduce, the, risk, of, injury, or, limit, penetration, arrows, designed, to, pierce, armor, in, the, middle, ages, used, a, very, narrow, and, sharp, tip, bodkinhead, to, concentrate, the, force, arrows, used, for, hunting, used, a, narrow, tip, broadhead, that, widens, further, to, facilitate, both, penetration, and, a, large, wound, using, archery, to, take, game, animals, is, known, as, bow, hunting, bow, hunting, differs, markedly, from, hunting, with, firearms, as, distance, between, hunter, and, prey, must, be, much, shorter, to, ensure, a, humane, kill, the, skills, and, practices, of, bow, hunting, therefore, emphasize, very, close, approach, to, the, prey, whether, by, still, hunting, stalking, or, waiting, in, a, blind, or, tree, stand, in, many, countries, including, much, of, the, united, states, bow, hunting, for, large, and, small, game, is, legal, bow, hunters, generally, enjoy, longer, seasons, than, are, allowed, with, other, forms, of, hunting, such, as, black, powder, shotgun, or, rifle, usually, compound, bows, are, used, for, large, game, hunting, due, to, the, relatively, short, time, it, takes, to, master, them, as, opposed, to, the, longbow, or, recurve, bow, these, compound, bows, may, feature, fiber, optic, sights, stabilizers, and, other, accessories, designed, to, increase, accuracy, at, longer, distances, using, a, bow, and, arrow, to, take, fish, is, known, as, bow, fishing, competitive, archery, involves, shooting, arrows, at, a, target, for, accuracy, from, a, set, distance, or, distances, this, is, the, most, popular, form, of, competitive, archery, worldwide, and, is, called, target, archery, a, form, particularly, popular, in, europe, and, america, is, field, archery, shot, at, targets, generally, set, at, various, distances, in, a, wooded, setting, competitive, archery, in, the, united, states, is, governed, by, usa, archery, and, national, field, archery, association, nfaa, which, also, certifies, instructors, para, archery, is, an, adaptation, of, archery, for, athletes, with, a, disability, governed, by, the, world, archery, wa, and, is, one, of, the, sports, in, the, summer, paralympic, games, there, are, also, several, other, lesser, known, and, historical, forms, of, archery, as, well, as, archery, novelty, games, and, flight, archery, where, the, aim, is, to, shoot, the, greatest, distance
