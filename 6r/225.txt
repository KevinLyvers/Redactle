chromosomes, one, from, each, parent, and, fertile, women, are, capable, of, pregnancy, and, giving, birth, from, puberty, until, menopause, more, generally, sex, differentiation, of, the, female, fetus, is, governed, by, the, lack, of, a, present, or, functioning, sry, gene, on, either, one, of, the, respective, sex, chromosomes, female, anatomy, is, distinguished, from, male, anatomy, by, the, female, reproductive, system, which, includes, the, ovaries, fallopian, tubes, uterus, vagina, and, vulva, an, adult, woman, generally, has, a, wider, pelvis, broader, hips, and, larger, breasts, than, an, adult, man, these, characteristics, facilitate, childbirth, and, breastfeeding, women, typically, have, less, facial, and, other, body, hair, have, a, higher, body, fat, composition, and, are, on, average, shorter, and, less, muscular, than, men, throughout, human, history, traditional, gender, roles, within, patriarchal, societies, have, often, defined, and, limited, women, s, activities, and, opportunities, resulting, in, gender, inequality, many, religious, doctrines, and, legal, systems, stipulate, certain, rules, for, women, with, restrictions, loosening, during, the, 20th, century, in, many, societies, women, have, gained, wider, access, to, careers, and, the, ability, to, pursue, higher, education, violence, against, women, whether, within, families, or, in, communities, has, a, long, history, and, is, primarily, committed, by, men, some, women, are, denied, reproductive, rights, the, movements, and, ideologies, of, feminism, have, a, shared, goal, of, achieving, gender, equality, transgender, women, are, women, who, were, assigned, male, at, birth, and, have, a, female, gender, identity, while, intersex, women, have, sex, characteristics, that, do, not, fit, typical, notions, of, female, biology, the, spelling, of, woman, in, english, has, progressed, over, the, past, millennium, from, w, fmann, to, w, mmann, to, wumman, and, finally, the, modern, spelling, woman, in, old, english, mann, had, the, gender, neutral, meaning, of, human, akin, to, the, modern, person, or, someone, the, word, for, woman, was, w, f, or, w, fmann, lit, woman, person, whereas, man, was, wer, or, w, pnedmann, from, w, pn, weapon, penis, however, following, the, norman, conquest, man, began, to, mean, male, human, and, by, the, late, 13th, century, it, had, largely, replaced, wer, the, consonants, f, and, m, in, w, fmann, coalesced, into, the, modern, woman, while, w, f, narrowed, to, specifically, mean, a, married, woman, wife, it, is, a, popular, misconception, that, the, term, woman, is, etymologically, connected, to, womb, womb, derives, from, the, old, english, word, wamb, meaning, belly, uterus, cognate, to, the, modern, german, colloquial, term, wamme, from, old, high, german, wamba, for, belly, paunch, lap, the, word, woman, can, be, used, generally, to, mean, any, female, human, or, specifically, to, mean, an, adult, female, human, as, contrasted, with, girl, the, word, girl, originally, meant, young, person, of, either, sex, in, english, it, was, only, around, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, that, it, came, to, mean, specifically, a, female, child, the, term, girl, is, sometimes, used, colloquially, to, refer, to, a, young, or, unmarried, woman, however, during, the, early, 1970s, feminists, challenged, such, use, because, the, use, of, the, word, to, refer, to, a, fully, grown, woman, may, cause, offence, in, particular, previously, common, terms, such, as, office, girl, are, no, longer, widely, used, conversely, in, certain, cultures, which, link, family, honor, with, female, virginity, the, word, girl, or, its, equivalent, in, other, languages, is, still, used, to, refer, to, a, never, married, woman, in, this, sense, it, is, used, in, a, fashion, roughly, analogous, to, the, more, or, less, obsolete, english, maid, or, maiden, different, countries, have, different, laws, but, age, 18, is, frequently, considered, the, age, of, majority, the, age, at, which, a, person, is, legally, considered, an, adult, the, social, sciences, views, on, what, it, means, to, be, a, woman, have, changed, significantly, since, the, early, 20th, century, as, women, gained, more, rights, and, greater, representation, in, the, workforce, with, scholarship, in, the, 1970s, moving, toward, a, focus, on, the, sex, gender, distinction, and, social, construction, of, gender, there, are, various, words, used, to, refer, to, the, quality, of, being, a, woman, the, term, womanhood, merely, means, the, state, of, being, a, woman, femininity, is, used, to, refer, to, a, set, of, typical, female, qualities, associated, with, a, certain, attitude, to, gender, roles, womanliness, is, like, femininity, but, is, usually, associated, with, a, different, view, of, gender, roles, distaff, is, an, archaic, adjective, derived, from, women, s, conventional, role, as, a, spinner, now, used, only, as, a, deliberate, archaism, menarche, the, onset, of, menstruation, occurs, on, average, at, age, 12, 13, many, cultures, have, rites, of, passage, to, symbolize, a, girl, s, coming, of, age, such, as, confirmation, in, some, branches, of, christianity, bat, mitzvah, in, judaism, or, a, custom, of, a, special, celebration, for, a, certain, birthday, generally, between, 12, and, 21, like, the, quincea, era, of, latin, america, male, and, female, bodies, have, some, differences, some, differences, such, as, the, external, sex, organs, are, visible, while, other, differences, such, as, internal, anatomy, and, genetic, characteristics, are, not, visible, typically, the, cells, of, female, humans, contain, two, x, chromosomes, while, the, cells, of, male, humans, have, an, x, and, a, y, chromosome, during, early, fetal, development, all, embryos, have, phenotypically, female, genitalia, up, until, week, 6, or, 7, when, a, male, embryo, s, gonads, differentiate, into, testes, due, to, the, action, of, the, sry, gene, on, the, y, chromosome, sex, differentiation, proceeds, in, female, humans, in, a, way, that, is, independent, of, gonadal, hormones, because, humans, inherit, mitochondrial, dna, only, from, the, mother, s, ovum, genealogical, researchers, can, trace, maternal, lineage, far, back, in, time, female, puberty, triggers, bodily, changes, that, enable, sexual, reproduction, via, fertilization, in, response, to, chemical, signals, from, the, pituitary, gland, the, ovaries, secrete, hormones, that, stimulate, maturation, of, the, body, including, increased, height, and, weight, body, hair, growth, breast, development, and, menarche, the, onset, of, menstruation, most, girls, go, through, menarche, between, ages, 12, 13, and, are, then, capable, of, becoming, pregnant, and, bearing, children, pregnancy, generally, requires, internal, fertilization, of, the, eggs, with, sperm, via, either, sexual, intercourse, or, artificial, insemination, though, in, vitro, fertilization, allows, fertilization, to, occur, outside, the, human, body, humans, are, similar, to, other, large, mammals, in, that, they, usually, give, birth, to, a, single, offspring, per, pregnancy, but, are, unusual, in, being, altricial, compared, to, most, other, large, mammals, meaning, young, are, undeveloped, at, time, of, birth, and, require, the, aid, of, their, parents, or, guardians, to, fully, mature, sometimes, humans, have, multiple, births, most, commonly, twins, usually, between, ages, 49, 52, a, woman, reaches, menopause, the, time, when, menstrual, periods, stop, permanently, and, they, are, no, longer, able, to, bear, children, unlike, most, other, mammals, the, human, lifespan, usually, extends, many, years, after, menopause, many, women, become, grandmothers, and, contribute, to, the, care, of, grandchildren, and, other, family, members, many, biologists, believe, that, the, extended, human, lifespan, is, evolutionarily, driven, by, kin, selection, though, other, theories, have, also, been, proposed, in, terms, of, biology, the, female, sex, organs, are, involved, in, the, reproductive, system, whereas, the, secondary, sex, characteristics, are, involved, in, breastfeeding, children, and, attracting, a, mate, humans, are, placental, mammals, which, means, the, mother, carries, the, fetus, in, the, uterus, and, the, placenta, facilitates, the, exchange, of, nutrients, and, waste, between, the, mother, and, fetus, the, internal, female, genitalia, consist, of, the, ovaries, gonads, that, produce, female, gametes, called, ova, the, fallopian, tubes, tubular, structures, that, transport, the, egg, cells, the, uterus, an, organ, with, tissue, to, protect, and, nurture, the, developing, fetus, and, its, cervix, to, expel, it, the, accessory, glands, bartholin, s, and, skene, s, two, pairs, of, glands, that, help, lubricate, during, intercourse, and, the, vagina, an, organ, used, in, copulating, and, birthing, the, vulva, external, female, genitalia, consists, of, the, clitoris, labia, majora, labia, minora, and, vestibule, the, vestibule, is, where, the, vaginal, and, urethral, openings, are, located, the, mammary, glands, are, hypothesized, to, have, evolved, from, apocrine, like, glands, to, produce, milk, a, nutritious, secretion, that, is, the, most, distinctive, characteristic, of, mammals, along, with, live, birth, in, mature, women, the, breast, is, generally, more, prominent, than, in, most, other, mammals, this, prominence, not, necessary, for, milk, production, is, thought, to, be, at, least, partially, the, result, of, sexual, selection, estrogens, which, are, primary, female, sex, hormones, have, a, significant, impact, on, a, female, s, body, shape, they, are, produced, in, both, men, and, women, but, their, levels, are, significantly, higher, in, women, especially, in, those, of, reproductive, age, besides, other, functions, estrogens, promote, the, development, of, female, secondary, sexual, characteristics, such, as, breasts, and, hips, as, a, result, of, estrogens, during, puberty, girls, develop, breasts, and, their, hips, widen, working, against, estrogen, the, presence, of, testosterone, in, a, pubescent, female, inhibits, breast, development, and, promotes, muscle, and, facial, hair, development, women, have, lower, hematocrit, the, volume, percentage, of, red, blood, cells, in, blood, than, men, this, is, due, to, lower, testosterone, which, stimulates, the, production, of, erythropoietin, by, the, kidney, the, normal, hematocrit, level, for, a, woman, is, 36, to, 48, for, men, 41, to, 50, the, normal, level, of, hemoglobin, an, oxygen, transport, protein, found, in, red, blood, cells, for, women, is, 12, 0, to, 15,

area, also, differs, to, men, s, when, controlling, for, body, size, and, age, in, addition, women, s, hearts, age, more, slowly, compared, to, men, s, hearts, girls, are, born, slightly, less, frequently, than, boys, the, ratio, is, around, 1, 1, 05, out, of, the, total, human, population, in, 2015, there, were, 1018, men, for, every, 1000, women, intersex, women, are, women, who, have, an, intersex, condition, usually, defined, as, those, born, with, ambiguous, genitalia, most, individuals, with, ambiguous, genitalia, are, assigned, female, at, birth, and, most, intersex, women, are, cisgender, the, medical, practices, to, assign, binary, female, to, intersex, youth, is, often, controversial, some, intersex, conditions, are, associated, with, typical, rates, of, female, gender, identity, while, others, are, associated, with, substantially, higher, rates, of, identifying, as, lgbt, compared, compared, to, the, general, population, female, sexuality, and, attraction, are, variable, and, a, woman, s, sexual, behavior, can, be, affected, by, many, factors, including, evolved, predispositions, personality, upbringing, and, culture, while, most, women, are, heterosexual, significant, minorities, are, lesbian, or, bisexual, some, cultures, use, a, gender, binary, in, which, woman, is, one, of, the, two, genders, the, other, being, man, while, other, cultures, such, as, south, asia, north, america, oceania, and, parts, of, south, america, recognise, a, third, gender, most, women, are, cisgender, and, were, assigned, female, at, birth, and, have, a, female, gender, identity, transgender, women, are, women, who, were, assigned, male, at, birth, they, have, a, female, gender, identity, and, may, experience, gender, dysphoria, distress, brought, upon, by, the, discrepancy, between, a, person, s, gender, identity, and, their, sex, assigned, at, birth, gender, dysphoria, may, be, treated, with, gender, affirming, care, which, may, include, social, or, medical, transition, social, transition, may, involve, changes, such, as, adopting, a, new, name, hairstyle, clothing, and, pronoun, associated, with, the, individual, s, affirmed, female, gender, identity, a, major, component, of, medical, transition, for, trans, women, is, feminizing, hormone, therapy, which, causes, the, development, of, female, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, breasts, redistribution, of, body, fat, and, lower, waist, hip, ratio, medical, transition, may, also, involve, gender, affirming, surgery, and, a, trans, woman, may, undergo, one, or, more, feminizing, procedures, which, result, in, anatomy, that, is, typically, gendered, female, like, cisgender, women, trans, women, may, have, any, sexual, orientation, factors, that, specifically, affect, the, health, of, women, in, comparison, with, men, are, most, evident, in, those, related, to, reproduction, but, sex, differences, have, been, identified, from, the, molecular, to, the, behavioral, scale, some, of, these, differences, are, subtle, and, difficult, to, explain, partly, due, to, the, fact, that, it, is, difficult, to, separate, the, health, effects, of, inherent, biological, factors, from, the, effects, of, the, surrounding, environment, they, exist, in, sex, chromosomes, and, hormones, as, well, as, sex, specific, lifestyles, metabolism, immune, system, function, and, sensitivity, to, environmental, factors, are, believed, to, contribute, to, sex, differences, in, health, at, the, levels, of, physiology, perception, and, cognition, women, can, have, distinct, responses, to, drugs, and, thresholds, for, diagnostic, parameters, some, diseases, primarily, affect, or, are, exclusively, found, in, women, such, as, lupus, breast, cancer, cervical, cancer, or, ovarian, cancer, the, medical, practice, dealing, with, female, reproduction, and, reproductive, organs, is, called, gynaecology, science, of, women, maternal, mortality, or, maternal, death, is, defined, by, who, as, the, death, of, a, woman, while, pregnant, or, within, 42, days, of, termination, of, pregnancy, irrespective, of, the, duration, and, site, of, the, pregnancy, from, any, cause, related, to, or, aggravated, by, the, pregnancy, or, its, management, but, not, from, accidental, or, incidental, causes, in, 2008, noting, that, each, year, more, than, 500, 000, women, die, of, complications, of, pregnancy, and, childbirth, and, at, least, seven, million, experience, serious, health, problems, while, 50, million, more, have, adverse, health, consequences, after, childbirth, the, world, health, organization, urged, midwife, training, to, strengthen, maternal, and, newborn, health, services, to, support, the, upgrading, of, midwifery, skills, the, who, established, a, midwife, training, program, action, for, safe, motherhood, in, 2017, 94, of, maternal, deaths, occur, in, low, and, lower, middle, income, countries, approximately, 86, of, maternal, deaths, occur, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, south, asia, with, sub, saharan, africa, accounting, for, around, 66, and, southern, asia, accounting, for, around, 20, the, main, causes, of, maternal, mortality, include, pre, eclampsia, and, eclampsia, unsafe, abortion, pregnancy, complications, from, malaria, and, hiv, aids, and, severe, bleeding, and, infections, following, childbirth, most, european, countries, australia, japan, and, singapore, are, very, safe, in, regard, to, childbirth, in, 1990, the, us, ranked, 12th, of, the, 14, developed, countries, that, were, analyzed, and, since, that, time, the, death, rates, of, every, country, have, steadily, improved, while, the, us, rate, has, spiked, dramatically, while, the, others, that, were, analyzed, in, 1990, show, a, 2017, death, rate, of, fewer, than, 10, deaths, per, every, 100, 000, live, births, the, u, s, rate, rose, to, 26, 4, furthermore, for, every, one, of, the, 700, to, 900, women, who, die, in, the, u, s, each, year, during, pregnancy, or, childbirth, 70, experience, significant, complications, totaling, more, than, one, percent, of, all, births, the, life, expectancy, for, women, is, generally, longer, than, men, s, this, advantage, begins, from, birth, with, newborn, girls, more, likely, to, survive, the, first, year, than, boys, worldwide, women, live, six, to, eight, years, longer, than, men, however, this, varies, by, place, and, situation, for, example, discrimination, against, women, has, lowered, female, life, expectancy, in, some, parts, of, asia, so, that, men, there, live, longer, than, women, the, difference, in, life, expectancy, are, believed, to, be, partly, due, to, biological, advantages, and, partly, due, to, gendered, behavioral, differences, between, men, and, women, for, example, women, are, less, likely, to, engage, in, unhealthy, behaviors, like, smoking, and, reckless, driving, and, consequently, have, fewer, preventable, premature, deaths, from, such, causes, in, some, developed, countries, the, life, expectancy, is, evening, out, this, is, believed, to, caused, both, by, worse, health, behaviors, among, women, especially, an, increased, rate, of, smoking, tobacco, by, women, and, improved, health, among, men, such, as, less, cardiovascular, disease, the, world, health, organization, who, writes, that, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, extra, years, of, life, for, women, are, not, always, lived, in, good, health, reproductive, rights, are, legal, rights, and, freedoms, relating, to, reproduction, and, reproductive, health, the, international, federation, of, gynecology, and, obstetrics, has, stated, that, the, world, health, organization, reports, that, based, on, data, from, 2010, to, 2014, 56, million, induced, abortions, occurred, worldwide, each, year, 25, of, all, pregnancies, of, those, about, 25, million, were, considered, as, unsafe, the, who, reports, that, in, developed, regions, about, 30, women, die, for, every, 100, 000, unsafe, abortions, and, that, number, rises, to, 220, deaths, per, 100, 000, unsafe, abortions, in, developing, regions, and, 520, deaths, per, 100, 000, unsafe, abortions, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, who, ascribes, these, deaths, to, femininity, also, called, womanliness, or, girlishness, is, a, set, of, attributes, behaviors, and, roles, generally, associated, with, women, and, girls, although, femininity, is, socially, constructed, some, behaviors, considered, feminine, are, biologically, influenced, the, extent, to, which, femininity, is, biologically, or, socially, influenced, is, subject, to, debate, it, is, distinct, from, the, definition, of, the, biological, female, sex, as, both, men, and, women, can, exhibit, feminine, traits, the, earliest, women, whose, names, are, known, include, in, recent, history, gender, roles, have, changed, greatly, at, some, earlier, points, in, history, children, s, occupational, aspirations, starting, at, a, young, age, differed, according, to, gender, traditionally, middle, class, women, were, involved, in, domestic, tasks, emphasizing, child, care, for, poorer, women, economic, necessity, compelled, them, to, seek, employment, outside, the, home, even, if, individual, poor, women, may, have, preferred, domestic, tasks, many, of, the, occupations, that, were, available, to, them, were, lower, in, pay, than, those, available, to, men, as, changes, in, the, labor, market, for, women, came, about, availability, of, employment, changed, from, only, dirty, long, hour, factory, jobs, to, cleaner, more, respectable, office, jobs, where, more, education, was, demanded, married, women, s, participation, in, the, u, s, labor, force, rose, from, 5, 6, 6, in, 1900, to, 23, 8, in, 1923, these, shifts, in, the, labor, force, led, to, changes, in, the, attitudes, towards, women, at, work, allowing, for, the, revolution, which, resulted, in, women, becoming, career, and, education, oriented, in, the, 1970s, many, female, academics, including, scientists, avoided, having, children, throughout, the, 1980s, institutions, tried, to, equalize, conditions, for, men, and, women, in, the, workplace, even, so, the, inequalities, at, home, hampered, women, s, opportunities, professional, women, were, still, generally, considered, responsible, for, domestic, labor, and, child, care, which, limited, the, time, and, energy, they, could, devote, to, their, careers, until, the, early, 20th, century, u, s, women, s, colleges, required, their, women, faculty, members, to, remain, single, on, the, grounds, that, a, woman, could, not, carry, on, two, full, time, professions, at, once, according, to, schiebinger, being, a, scientist, and, a, wife, and, a, mother, is, a, burden, in, society, that, expects, women, more, often, than, men, to, put, family, ahead, of, career, p, 93, movements, advocate, equality, of, opportunity, for, both, sexes, and, equal, rights, irrespective, of, gender, through, a, combination, of, economic, changes, and, the, efforts, of, the, feminist, movement, in, recent, decades, women, in, many, societies, have, gained, access, to, careers, beyond, the, traditional, homemaker, despite, these, advances, modern, women, in, western, society, still, face, challenges, in, the, workplace, as, well, as, with, the, topics, of, education, violence, health, care, politics, and, motherhood, and, others, sexism, can, be, a, main, concern, and, barrier, for, women, almost, anywhere, though, its, forms, perception, and, gravity, vary, between, societies, and, social, classes, there, has, been, an, increase, in, the, endorsement, of, egalitarian, gender, roles, in, the, home, by, both, women, and, men, although, a, greater, number, of, women, are, seeking, higher, education, their, salaries, are, often, less, than, those, of, men, cbs, news, said, in, 2005, that, in, the, united, states, women, who, are, ages, 30, to, 44, and, hold, a, university, degree, make, 62, of, what, similarly, qualified, men, do, a, lower, rate, than, in, all, but, three, of, the, 19, countries, for, which, numbers, are, available, some, western, nations, with, greater, inequality, in, pay, are, germany, new, zealand, and, switzerland, particular, religious, doctrines, have, specific, stipulations, relating, to, gender, roles, social, and, private, interaction, between, the, sexes, appropriate, dressing, attire, for, women, and, various, other, issues, affecting, women, and, their, position, in, society, in, many, countries, these, religious, teachings, influence, the, criminal, law, or, the, family, law, of, those, jurisdictions, see, sharia, law, for, example, the, relation, between, religion, law, and, gender, equality, has, been, discussed, by, international, organizations, the, un, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, violence, against, women, defines, violence, against, women, as, any, act, of, gender, based, violence, that, results, in, or, is, likely, to, result, in, physical, sexual, or, mental, harm, or, suffering, to, women, including, threats, of, such, acts, coercion, or, arbitrary, deprivation, of, liberty, whether, occurring, in, public, or, in, private, life, it, identifies, three, forms, of, such, violence, that, which, occurs, in, the, family, that, which, occurs, within, the, general, community, and, that, which, is, perpetrated, or, condoned, by, the, state, it, also, states, that, violence, against, women, is, a, manifestation, of, historically, unequal, power, relations, between, men, and, women, violence, against, women, remains, a, widespread, problem, fueled, especially, outside, the, west, by, patriarchal, social, values, lack, of, adequate, laws, and, lack, of, enforcement, of, existing, laws, social, norms, that, exist, in, many, parts, of, the, world, hinder, progress, towards, protecting, women, from, violence, for, example, according, to, surveys, by, unicef, the, percentage, of, women, aged, 15, 49, who, think, that, a, husband, is, justified, in, hitting, or, beating, his, wife, under, certain, circumstances, is, as, high, as, 90, in, afghanistan, and, jordan, 87, in, mali, 86, in, guinea, and, timor, leste, 81, in, laos, and, 80, in, the, central, african, republic, a, 2010, survey, conducted, by, the, pew, research, center, found, that, stoning, as, a, punishment, for, adultery, was, supported, by, 82, of, respondents, in, egypt, and, pakistan, 70, in, jordan, 56, nigeria, and, 42, in, indonesia, specific, forms, of, violence, that, affect, women, include, female, genital, mutilation, sex, trafficking, forced, prostitution, forced, marriage, rape, sexual, harassment, honor, killings, acid, throwing, and, dowry, related, violence, governments, can, be, complicit, in, violence, against, women, such, as, when, stoning, is, used, as, a, legal, punishment, mostly, for, women, accused, of, adultery, there, have, also, been, many, forms, of, violence, against, women, which, have, been, prevalent, historically, notably, the, burning, of, witches, the, sacrifice, of, widows, such, as, sati, and, foot, binding, the, prosecution, of, women, accused, of, witchcraft, has, a, long, tradition, for, example, during, the, early, modern, period, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, witch, trials, were, common, in, europe, and, in, the, european, colonies, in, north, america, today, there, remain, regions, of, the, world, such, as, parts, of, sub, saharan, africa, rural, north, india, and, papua, new, guinea, where, belief, in, witchcraft, is, held, by, many, people, and, women, accused, of, being, witches, are, subjected, to, serious, violence, in, addition, there, are, also, countries, which, have, criminal, legislation, against, the, practice, of, witchcraft, in, saudi, arabia, witchcraft, remains, a, crime, punishable, by, death, and, in, 2011, the, country, beheaded, a, woman, for, witchcraft, and, sorcery, it, is, also, the, case, that, certain, forms, of, violence, against, women, have, been, recognized, as, criminal, offences, only, during, recent, decades, and, are, not, universally, prohibited, in, that, many, countries, continue, to, allow, them, this, is, especially, the, case, with, marital, rape, in, the, western, world, there, has, been, a, trend, towards, ensuring, gender, equality, within, marriage,

per, woman, and, the, lowest, in, singapore, 0, 82, children, woman, while, most, sub, saharan, african, countries, have, a, high, tfr, which, creates, problems, due, to, lack, of, resources, and,

higher, expectations, for, their, careers, than, boys, of, the, same, age, while, women, account, for, more, than, half, of, university, graduates, in, several, oecd, countries, they, receive, only, 30, of, tertiary, degrees, granted, in, science, and, engineering, fields, and, women, account, for, only, 25, to, 35, of, researchers, in, most, oecd, countries, research, shows, that, while, women, are, studying, at, prestigious, universities, at, the, same, rate, as, men, they, are, not, being, given, the, same, chance, to, join, the, faculty, sociologist, harriet, zuckerman, has, observed,

19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, then, in, 1920, when, women, in, the, us, received, universal, suffrage, with, the, passage, of, the, nineteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, some, western, countries, were, slow, to, allow, women, to, vote, notably, switzerland, where, women, gained, the, right, to, vote, in, federal, elections, in, 1971, and, in, the, canton, of, appenzell, innerrhoden, women, were, granted, the, right, to, vote, on, local, issues, only, in, 1991, when, the, canton, was, forced, to, do, so, by, the, federal, supreme, court, of, switzerland, and, liechtenstein, in, 1984, through, a, women, s, suffrage, referendum, women, have, throughout, history, made, contributions, to, science, literature, and, art, one, area, where, women, have, been, permitted, most, access, historically, was, that, of, obstetrics, and, gynecology, prior, to, the, 18th, century, caring, for, pregnant, women, in, europe, was, undertaken, by, women, from, the, mid, 18th, century, onwards, medical, monitoring, of, pregnant, women, started, to, require, rigorous, formal, education, to, which, women, did, not, generally, have, access, and, thus, the, practice, was, largely, transferred, to, men, writing, was, generally, also, considered, acceptable, for, upper, class, women, although, achieving, success, as, a, female, writer, in, a, male, dominated, world, could, be, very, difficult, as, a, result, of, several, women, writers, adopted, a, male, pen, name, e, g, george, sand, george, eliot, women, have, been, composers, songwriters, instrumental,

songwriters, many, of, them, being, singer, songwriters, there, are, few, women, record, producers, rock, critics, and, rock, instrumentalists, although, there, have, been, a, huge, number, of, women,

music, criticism, music, journalism, music, producing, and, sound, engineering, while, women, were, discouraged, from, composing, in, the, 19th, century, and, there, are, few, women, musicologists, women, became, involved, in, music, education, to, such, a, degree, that, women, dominated, during, the, later, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, well, into, the, 20th, century, according, to, jessica, duchen, a, music, writer, for, london, s, the, independent, women, musicians, in, classical, music, are, too, often, judged, for, their, appearances, rather, than, their, talent, and, they, face, pressure, to, look, sexy, onstage, and, in, photos, duchen, states, that, while, here, are, women, musicians, who, refuse, to, play, on, their, looks, the, ones, who, do, tend, to, be, more, materially, successful, according, to, the, uk, s, radio, 3, editor, edwina, wolstencroft, the, classical, music, industry, has, long, been, open, to, having, women, in, performance, or, entertainment, roles, but, women, are, much, less, likely, to, have, positions, of, authority, such, as, being, the, leader, of, an, orchestra, in, popular, music, while, there, are, many, women,
