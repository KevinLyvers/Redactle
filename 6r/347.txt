shifted, from, soccer, style, rules, to, rugby, style, rules, although, it, could, easily, have, been, called, rugby, at, this, point, harvard, one, of, the, primary, proponents, of, the, rugby, style, game, compromised, and, did, not, request, the, name, of, the, sport, be, changed, to, rugby, the, terms, gridiron, or, american, football, are, favored, in, english, speaking, countries, where, other, types, of, football, are, popular, such, as, the, united, kingdom, ireland, new, zealand, and, australia, american, football, evolved, from, the, sports, of, rugby, and, soccer, rugby, like, american, football, is, a, sport, in, which, two, competing, teams, vie, for, control, of, a, ball, which, can, be, kicked, through, a, set, of, goalposts, or, run, into, the, opponent, s, goal, area, to, score, points, what, is, considered, to, be, the, first, american, football, game, was, played, on, november, 6, 1869, between, rutgers, and, princeton, two, college, teams, they, consisted, of, 25, players, per, team, and, used, a, round, ball, that, could, not, be, picked, up, or, carried, it, could, however, be, kicked, or, batted, with, the, feet, hands, head, or, sides, with, the, objective, being, to, advance, it, into, the, opponent, s, goal, rutgers, won, the, game, 6, 4, collegiate, play, continued, for, several, years, with, games, played, using, the, rules, of, the, host, school, representatives, of, yale, columbia, princeton, and, rutgers, met, on, october, 19, 1873, to, create, a, standard, set, of, rules, for, use, by, all, schools, teams, were, set, at, 20, players, each, and, fields, of, 400, by, 250, feet, 122, m, 76, m, were, specified, harvard, abstained, from, the, conference, as, they, favored, a, rugby, style, game, that, allowed, running, with, the, ball, after, playing, mcgill, university, using, both, american, known, as, the, boston, game, for, the, first, game, and, canadian, rugby, rules, for, the, second, one, the, harvard, players, preferred, the, canadian, style, of, having, only, 11, men, on, the, field, running, the, ball, without, having, to, be, chased, by, an, opponent, the, forward, pass, tackling, and, using, an, oblong, instead, of, a, round, ball, an, 1875, harvard, yale, game, played, under, rugby, style, rules, was, observed, by, two, princeton, athletes, who, were, impressed, by, it, they, introduced, the, sport, to, princeton, a, feat, the, professional, football, researchers, association, compared, to, selling, refrigerators, to, eskimos, princeton, harvard, yale, and, columbia, then, agreed, to, intercollegiate, play, using, a, form, of, rugby, union, rules, with, a, modified, scoring, system, these, schools, formed, the, intercollegiate, football, association, although, yale, did, not, join, until, 1879, yale, player, walter, camp, now, regarded, as, the, father, of, american, football, secured, rule, changes, in, 1880, that, reduced, the, size, of, each, team, from, 15, to, 11, players, and, instituted, the, snap, to, replace, the, chaotic, and, inconsistent, scrum, while, the, game, between, rutgers, and, princeton, is, commonly, considered, the, first, american, football, game, several, years, prior, in, 1862, the, oneida, football, club, formed, as, the, oldest, known, football, club, in, the, united, states, the, team, consisted, of, graduates, of, boston, s, elite, preparatory, schools, and, played, from, 1862, to, 1865, the, introduction, of, the, snap, resulted, in, an, unexpected, consequence, before, the, snap, the, strategy, had, been, to, punt, if, a, scrum, resulted, in, bad, field, position, however, a, group, of, princeton, players, realized, that, as, the, snap, was, uncontested, they, could, now, hold, the, ball, indefinitely, to, prevent, their, opponent, from, scoring, in, 1881, in, a, game, between, yale, and, princeton, both, teams, used, this, strategy, to, maintain, their, undefeated, records, each, team, held, the, ball, gaining, no, ground, for, an, entire, half, resulting, in, a, 0, 0, tie, this, block, game, proved, extremely, unpopular, with, both, teams, spectators, and, fans, a, rule, change, was, necessary, to, prevent, this, strategy, from, taking, hold, and, a, reversion, to, the, scrum, was, considered, however, camp, successfully, proposed, a, rule, in, 1882, that, limited, each, team, to, three, downs, or, tackles, to, advance, the, ball, 5, yards, 4, 6, m, failure, to, advance, the, ball, the, required, distance, within, those, three, downs, would, result, in, control, of, the, ball, being, forfeited, to, the, other, team, this, change, effectively, made, american, football, a, separate, sport, from, rugby, and, the, resulting, five, yard, lines, added, to, the, field, to, measure, distances, made, it, resemble, a, gridiron, in, appearance, other, major, rule, changes, included, a, reduction, of, the, field, size, to, 110, by, 53, 1, 3, yards, 100, 6, m, 48, 8, m, and, the, adoption, of, a, scoring, system, that, awarded, four, points, for, a, touchdown, two, for, a, safety, and, a, goal, following, a, touchdown, and, five, for, a, goal, from, the, field, additionally, tackling, below, the, waist, was, legalized, and, a, static, line, of, scrimmage, was, instituted, despite, these, new, rules, football, remained, a, violent, sport, dangerous, mass, formations, like, the, flying, wedge, resulted, in, serious, injuries, and, deaths, a, 1905, peak, of, 19, fatalities, nationwide, resulted, in, a, threat, by, president, theodore, roosevelt, to, abolish, the, game, unless, major, changes, were, made, in, response, 62, colleges, and, universities, met, in, new, york, city, to, discuss, rule, changes, on, december, 28, 1905, these, proceedings, resulted, in, the, formation, of, the, intercollegiate, athletic, association, of, the, united, states, later, renamed, the, national, collegiate, athletic, association, ncaa, the, legal, forward, pass, was, introduced, in, 1906, although, its, effect, was, initially, minimal, due, to, the, restrictions, placed, on, its, use, the, idea, of, a, 40, yard, wider, field, was, opposed, by, harvard, due, to, the, size, of, the, new, harvard, stadium, other, rule, changes, introduced, that, year, included, the, reduction, of, playing, time, from, 70, to, 60, minutes, and, an, increase, of, the, distance, required, for, a, first, down, from, 5, to, 10, yards, 4, 6, to, 9, 1, m, to, reduce, infighting, and, dirty, play, between, teams, the, neutral, zone, was, created, along, the, width, of, the, football, before, the, snap, scoring, was, also, adjusted, points, awarded, for, field, goals, were, reduced, to, three, in, 1909, and, points, for, touchdowns, were, raised, to, six, in, 1912, also, in, 1912, the, field, was, shortened, to, 100, yards, 91, m, long, two, 10, yard, long, 9, 1, m, end, zones, were, created, and, teams, were, given, four, downs, instead, of, three, to, advance, the, ball, 10, yards, 9, 1, m, the, roughing, the, passer, penalty, was, implemented, in, 1914, and, eligible, players, were, first, allowed, to, catch, the, ball, anywhere, on, the, field, in, 1918, on, november, 12, 1892, pudge, heffelfinger, was, paid, 500, equivalent, to, 16, 956, in, 2023, to, play, a, game, for, the, allegheny, athletic, association, against, the, pittsburgh, athletic, club, this, is, the, first, recorded, instance, of, a, player, being, paid, to, participate, in, a, game, of, american, football, although, many, athletic, clubs, in, the, 1880s, offered, indirect, benefits, such, as, helping, players, attain, employment, giving, out, trophies, or, watches, that, players, could, pawn, for, money, or, paying, double, in, expense, money, despite, these, extra, benefits, the, game, had, a, strict, sense, of, amateurism, at, the, time, and, direct, payment, to, players, was, frowned, upon, if, not, prohibited, outright, over, time, professional, play, became, increasingly, common, and, with, it, came, rising, salaries, and, unpredictable, player, movement, as, well, as, the, illegal, payment, of, college, players, who, were, still, in, school, the, national, football, league, nfl, a, group, of, professional, teams, that, was, originally, established, in, 1920, as, the, american, professional, football, association, aimed, to, solve, these, problems, this, new, league, s, stated, goals, included, an, end, to, bidding, wars, over, players, prevention, of, the, use, of, college, players, and, abolition, of, the, practice, of, paying, players, to, leave, another, team, by, 1922, the, nfl, had, established, itself, as, america, s, premier, professional, football, league, the, dominant, form, of, football, at, the, time, was, played, at, the, collegiate, level, the, upstart, nfl, received, a, boost, to, its, legitimacy, in, 1925, however, when, an, nfl, team, the, pottsville, maroons, defeated, a, team, of, notre, dame, all, stars, in, an, exhibition, game, a, greater, emphasis, on, the, passing, game, helped, professional, football, to, distinguish, itself, further, from, the, college, game, during, the, late, 1930s, football, in, general, became, increasingly, popular, following, the, 1958, nfl, championship, game, between, the, baltimore, colts, and, the, new, york, giants, still, referred, to, as, the, greatest, game, ever, played, the, game, a, 23, 17, overtime, victory, by, the, colts, was, seen, by, millions, of, television, viewers, and, had, a, major, influence, on, the, popularity, of, the, sport, this, along, with, the, innovations, introduced, by, the, new, american, football, league, afl, in, the, early, 1960s, helped, football, to, become, the, most, popular, sport, in, the, united, states, by, the, mid, 1960s, the, rival, afl, arose, in, 1960, and, challenged, the, nfl, s, dominance, the, afl, began, in, relative, obscurity, but, eventually, thrived, with, an, initial, television, contract, with, the, abc, television, network, the, afl, s, existence, forced, the, conservative, nfl, to, expand, to, dallas, and, minnesota, in, an, attempt, to, destroy, the, new, league, meanwhile, the, afl, introduced, many, new, features, to, professional, football, in, the, united, states, official, time, was, kept, on, a, scoreboard, clock, rather, than, on, a, watch, in, the, referee, s, pocket, as, the, nfl, did, optional, two, point, conversions, by, pass, or, run, after, touchdowns, names, on, the, jerseys, of, players, and, several, others, including, expansion, of, the, role, of, minority, players, actively, recruited, by, the, league, in, contrast, to, the, nfl, the, afl, also, signed, several, star, college, players, who, had, also, been, drafted, by, nfl, teams, competition, for, players, heated, up, in, 1965, when, the, afl, new, york, jets, signed, rookie, joe, namath, to, a, then, record, 437, 000, contract, equivalent, to, 4, 23, million, in, 2023, a, five, year, 40, million, nbc, television, contract, followed, which, helped, to, sustain, the, young, league, the, bidding, war, for, players, ended, in, 1966, when, nfl, owners, approached, the, afl, regarding, a, merger, and, the, two, leagues, agreed, on, one, that, took, full, effect, in, 1970, this, agreement, provided, for, a, common, draft, that, would, take, place, each, year, and, it, instituted, an, annual, world, championship, game, to, be, played, between, the, champions, of, each, league, this, championship, game, began, play, at, the, end, of, the, 1966, season, once, the, merger, was, completed, it, was, no, longer, a, championship, game, between, two, leagues, and, reverted, to, the, nfl, championship, game, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, super, bowl, college, football, maintained, a, tradition, of, postseason, bowl, games, each, bowl, game, was, associated, with, a, particular, conference, and, earning, a, spot, in, a, bowl, game, was, the, reward, for, winning, a, conference, this, arrangement, was, profitable, but, it, tended, to, prevent, the, two, top, ranked, teams, from, meeting, in, a, true, national, championship, game, as, they, would, normally, be, committed, to, the, bowl, games, of, their, respective, conferences, several, systems, have, been, used, since, 1992, to, determine, a, national, champion, of, college, football, the, first, was, the, bowl, coalition, in, place, from, 1992, to, 1994, this, was, replaced, in, 1995, by, the, bowl, alliance, which, gave, way, to, the, bowl, championship, series, bcs, in, 1997, the, bcs, arrangement, proved, to, be, controversial, and, was, replaced, in, 2014, by, the, college, football, playoff, cfp, a, football, game, is, played, between, two, teams, of, 11, players, each, playing, with, more, on, the,

league, the, nfl, has, a, 53, man, roster, while, ncaa, division, i, allows, teams, to, have, 63, scholarship, players, in, the, fcs, and, 85, scholarship, players, in, the, fbs, respectively,
