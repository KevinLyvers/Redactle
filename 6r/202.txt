hospitals, or, elders, in, nursing, homes, pet, therapy, utilizes, trained, animals, and, handlers, to, achieve, specific, physical, social, cognitive, or, emotional, goals, with, patients, people, most, commonly, get, pets, for, companionship, to, protect, a, home, or, property, or, because, of, the, perceived, beauty, or, attractiveness, of, the, animals, a, 1994, canadian, study, found, that, the, most, common, reasons, for, not, owning, a, pet, were, lack, of, ability, to, care, for, the, pet, when, traveling, 34, 6, lack, of, time, 28, 6, and, lack, of, suitable, housing, 28, 3, with, dislike, of, pets, being, less, common, 19, 6, some, scholars, ethicists, and, animal, rights, organizations, have, raised, concerns, over, keeping, pets, because, of, the, lack, of, autonomy, and, the, objectification, of, non, human, animals, in, china, spending, on, domestic, animals, has, grown, from, an, estimated, 3, 12, billion, in, 2010, to, 25, billion, in, 2018, the, chinese, people, own, 51, million, dogs, and, 41, million, cats, with, pet, owners, often, preferring, to, source, pet, food, internationally, there, are, a, total, of, 755, million, pets, increased, from, 389, million, in, 2013, according, to, a, survey, promoted, by, italian, family, associations, in, 2009, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, approximately, 45, million, pets, in, italy, this, includes, 7, million, dogs, 7, 5, million, cats, 16, million, fish, 12, million, birds, and, 10, million, snakes, a, 2007, survey, by, the, university, of, bristol, found, that, 26, of, uk, households, owned, cats, and, 31, owned, dogs, estimating, total, domestic, populations, of, approximately, 10, 3, million, cats, and, 10, 5, million, dogs, in, 2006, the, survey, also, found, that, 47, 2, of, households, with, a, cat, had, at, least, one, person, educated, to, degree, level, compared, with, 38, 4, of, homes, with, dogs, there, are, approximately, 86, 4, million, pet, cats, and, approximately, 78, 2, million, pet, dogs, in, the, united, states, and, a, united, states, 2007, 2008, survey, showed, that, dog, owning, households, outnumbered, those, owning, cats, but, that, the, total, number, of, pet, cats, was, higher, than, that, of, dogs, the, same, was, true, for, 2011, in, 2013, pets, outnumbered, children, four, to, one, in, the, united, states, keeping, animals, as, pets, may, be, detrimental, to, their, health, if, certain, requirements, are, not, met, an, important, issue, is, inappropriate, feeding, which, may, produce, clinical, effects, the, consumption, of, chocolate, or, grapes, by, dogs, for, example, may, prove, fatal, certain, species, of, houseplants, can, also, prove, toxic, if, consumed, by, pets, examples, include, philodendrons, and, easter, lilies, which, can, cause, severe, kidney, damage, to, cats, and, poinsettias, begonia, and, aloe, vera, which, are, mildly, toxic, to, dogs, for, birds, chocolate, can, be, deadly, and, foods, intended, for, human, consumption, such, as, bread, crackers, and, dairy, items, can, potentially, cause, health, problems, housepets, particularly, dogs, and, cats, in, industrialized, societies, are, highly, susceptible, to, obesity, overweight, pets, have, been, shown, to, be, at, a, higher, risk, of, developing, diabetes, liver, problems, joint, pain, kidney, failure, and, cancer, lack, of, exercise, and, high, caloric, diets, are, considered, to, be, the, primary, contributors, to, pet, obesity, it, is, widely, believed, among, the, public, and, among, many, scientists, that, pets, probably, bring, mental, and, physical, health, benefits, to, their, owners, a, 1987, nih, statement, cautiously, argued, that, existing, data, was, suggestive, of, a, significant, benefit, a, recent, dissent, comes, from, a, 2017, rand, study, which, found, that, at, least, in, the, case, of, children, having, a, pet, per, se, failed, to, improve, physical, or, mental, health, by, a, statistically, significant, amount, instead, the, study, found, children, who, were, already, prone, to, being, healthy, were, more, likely, to, get, pets, in, the, first, place, conducting, long, term, randomized, trials, to, settle, the, issue, would, be, costly, or, infeasible, pets, might, have, the, ability, to, stimulate, their, caregivers, in, particular, the, elderly, giving, people, someone, to, take, care, of, someone, to, exercise, with, and, someone, to, help, them, heal, from, a, physically, or, psychologically, troubled, past, animal, company, can, also, help, people, to, preserve, acceptable, levels, of, happiness, despite, the, presence, of, mood, symptoms, like, anxiety, or, depression, having, a, pet, may, also, help, people, achieve, health, goals, such, as, lowered, blood, pressure, or, mental, goals, such, as, decreased, stress, there, is, evidence, that, having, a, pet, can, help, a, person, lead, a, longer, healthier, life, in, a, 1986, study, of, 92, people, hospitalized, for, coronary, ailments, within, a, year, 11, of, the, 29, patients, without, pets, had, died, compared, to, only, 3, of, the, 52, patients, who, had, pets, having, pet, s, was, shown, to, significantly, reduce, triglycerides, and, thus, heart, disease, risk, in, the, elderly, a, study, by, the, national, institute, of, health, found, that, people, who, owned, dogs, were, less, likely, to, die, as, a, result, of, a, heart, attack, than, those, who, did, not, own, one, there, is, some, evidence, that, pets, may, have, a, therapeutic, effect, in, dementia, cases, other, studies, have, shown, that, for, the, elderly, good, health, may, be, a, requirement, for, having, a, pet, and, not, a, result, dogs, trained, to, be, guide, dogs, can, help, people, with, vision, impairment, dogs, trained, in, the, field, of, animal, assisted, therapy, aat, can, also, benefit, people, with, other, disabilities, people, residing, in, a, long, term, care, facility, such, as, a, hospice, or, nursing, home, may, experience, health, benefits, from, pets, pets, help, them, to, cope, with, the, emotional, issues, related, to, their, illness, they, also, offer, physical, contact, with, another, living, creature, something, that, is, often, missing, in, an, elder, s, life, pets, for, nursing, homes, are, chosen, based, on, the, size, of, the, pet, the, amount, of, care, that, the, breed, needs, and, the, population, and, size, of, the, care, institution, appropriate, pets, go, through, a, screening, process, and, if, it, is, a, dog, additional, training, programs, to, become, a, therapy, dog, there, are, three, types, of, therapy, dogs, facility, therapy, dogs, animal, assisted, therapy, dogs, and, therapeutic, visitation, dogs, the, most, common, therapy, dogs, are, therapeutic, visitation, dogs, these, dogs, are, household, pets, whose, handlers, take, time, to, visit, hospitals, nursing, homes, detention, facilities, and, rehabilitation, facilities, different, pets, require, varying, amounts, of, attention, and, care, for, example, cats, may, have, lower, maintenance, requirements, than, dogs, in, addition, to, providing, health, benefits, for, their, owners, pets, also, impact, the, social, lives, of, their, owners, and, their, connection, to, their, community, there, is, some, evidence, that, pets, can, facilitate, social, interaction, assistant, professor, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, leslie, irvine, has, focused, her, attention, on, pets, of, the, homeless, population, her, studies, of, pet, ownership, among, the, homeless, found, that, many, modify, their, life, activities, for, fear, of, losing, their, pets, pet, ownership, prompts, them, to, act, responsibly, with, many, making, a, deliberate, choice, not, to, drink, or, use, drugs, and, to, avoid, contact, with, substance, abusers, or, those, involved, in, any, criminal, activity, for, fear, of, being, separated, from, their, pet, additionally, many, refuse, to, house, in, shelters, if, their, pet, is, not, allowed, to, stay, with, them, health, risks, that, are, associated, with, pets, include, the, european, convention, for, the, protection, of, pet, animals, is, a, 1987, treaty, of, the, council, of, europe, but, accession, to, the, treaty, is, open, to, all, states, in, the, world, to, promote, the, welfare, of, pet, animals, and, ensure, minimum, standards, for, their, treatment, and, protection, it, went, into, effect, on, 1, may, 1992, and, as, of, june, 2020, it, has, been, ratified, by, 24, states, pets, have, commonly, been, considered, private, property, owned, by, individual, persons, many, legal, protections, have, existed, historically, and, today, with, the, intention, of, safeguarding, pets, and, other, animals, well, being, since, the, year, 2000, a, small, but, increasing, number, of, jurisdictions, in, north, america, have, enacted, laws, redefining, pet, s, owners, as, guardians, intentions, have, been, characterized, as, simply, changing, attitudes, and, perceptions, but, not, legal, consequences, to, working, toward, legal, personhood, for, pets, themselves, some, veterinarians, and, breeders, have, opposed, these, moves, the, question, of, pets, legal, status, can, arise, with, concern, to, purchase, or, adoption, custody, divorce, estate, and, inheritance, injury, damage, and, veterinary, malpractice, states, cities, and, towns, in, western, countries, commonly, enact, local, ordinances, to, limit, the, number, or, kind, of, pets, a, person, may, keep, personally, or, for, business, purposes, prohibited, pets, may, be, specific, to, certain, breeds, such, as, pit, bulls, or, rottweilers, they, may, apply, to, general, categories, of, animals, such, as, livestock, exotic, animals, wild, animals, and, canid, or, felid, hybrids, or, they, may, simply, be, based, on, the, animal, s, size, additional, or, different, maintenance, rules, and, regulations, may, also, apply, condominium, associations, and, owners, of, rental, properties, also, commonly, limit, or, forbid, tenants, keeping, of, pets, in, belgium, and, the, netherlands, the, government, publishes, white, lists, and, black, lists, called, positive, and, negative, lists, with, animal, species, that, are, designated, to, be, appropriate, to, be, kept, as, pets, positive, or, not, negative, the, dutch, ministry, of, economic, affairs, and, climate, policy, originally, established, its, first, positive, list, positieflijst, per, 1, february, 2015, for, a, set, of, 100, mammals, including, cats, dogs, and, production, animals, deemed, appropriate, as, pets, on, the, recommendations, of, wageningen, university, parliamentary, debates, about, such, a, pet, list, date, back, to, the, 1980s, with, continuous, disagreements, about, which, species, should, be, included, and, how, the, law, should, be, enforced, in, january, 2017, the, white, list, was, expanded, to, 123, species, while, the, black, list, that, had, been, set, up, was, expanded, with, animals, like, the, brown, bear, and, two, great, kangaroo, species, to, contain, 153, species, unfit, for, petting, such, as, the, armadillo, the, sloth, the, european, hare, and, the, wild, boar, in, january, 2011, the, belgian, federal, agency, for, the, safety, of, the, food, chain, stated, that, people, are, not, allowed, to, kill, miscellaneous, or, unknown, cats, walking, in, their, garden, but, nowhere, in, the, law, does, it, say, that, you, can, t, eat, your, cat, dog, rabbit, fish, or, whatever, you, just, have, to, kill, them, in, an, animal, friendly, way, since, 1, july, 2014, it, is, illegal, in, the, netherlands, for, owners, to, kill, their, own, cats, and, dogs, kept, as, pets, parakeets, guinea, pigs, hamsters, and, other, animals, may, still, be, killed, by, their, owners, but, nonetheless, when, owners, mistreat, their, companion, animals, for, example, in, the, process, of, killing, them, the, owners, can, still, be, prosecuted, under, dutch, law, pets, have, a, considerable, environmental, impact, especially, in, countries, where, they, are, common, or, held, in, high, densities, for, instance, the, 163, million, dogs, and, cats, kept, in, the, united, states, consume, about, 20, of, the, amount, of, dietary, energy, that, humans, do, and, an, estimated, 33, of, the, animal, derived, energy, they, produce, about, 30, 13, by, mass, as, much, feces, as, americans, and, through, their, diet, constitute, about, 25, 30, of, the, environmental, impacts, from, animal, production, in, terms, of, the, use, of, land, water, fossil, fuel, phosphate, and, biocides, dog, and, cat, animal, product, consumption, is, responsible, for, the, release, of, up, to, 64, 16, million, tons, co, 2, equivalent, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, two, powerful, greenhouse, gasses, americans, are, the, largest, pet, owners, in, the, world, but, pet, ownership, in, the, us, has, considerable, environmental, costs, while, many, people, have, kept, many, different, species, of, animals, in, captivity, over, the, course, of, human, history, only, a, relative, few, have, been, kept, long, enough, to, be, considered, domesticated, other, types, of, animal, notably, monkeys, have, never, been, domesticated, but, are, still, sold, and, kept, as, pets, some, wild, animals, are, kept, as, pets, such, as, tigers, even, though, this, is, illegal, there, is, a, market, for, illegal, pets, domesticated, pets, are, the, most, common, a, domesticated, animal, is, a, species, that, has, been, made, fit, for, a, human, environment, by, being, consistently, kept, in, captivity, and, selectively, bred, over, a, long, enough, period, of, time, that, it, exhibits, marked, differences, in, behavior, and, appearance, from, its, wild, relatives, domestication, contrasts, with, taming, which, is, simply, when, an, un, domesticated, wild, animal, has, become, tolerant, of, human, presence, and, perhaps, even, enjoys, it, large, mammals, that, might, be, kept, as, pets, include, alpaca, camel, cattle, donkey, goat, horse, llama, pig, and, sheep, small, mammals, that, might, be, kept, as, pets, include, ferret, hedgehog, rabbit, sugar, glider, and, rodents, including, rat, mouse, hamster, guinea, pig, gerbil, and, chinchilla, other, mammals, include, cat, dog, monkey, and, domesticated, silver, fox, birds, kept, as, pets, include, companion, parrots, like, the, budgie, and, cockatiel, fowl, such, as, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and, quail, columbines, and, passerines, namely, finches, and, canaries, fish, kept, as, pets, include, goldfish, koi, siamese, fighting, fish, betta, barb, guppy, molly, japanese, rice, fish, medaka, and, oscar, arthropods, kept, as, pets, include, bees, such, as, honey, bees, and, stingless, bees, silk, moth, and, ant, farms, reptiles, and, amphibians, kept, as, pets, include, snakes, turtles, axolotl, frogs, and, salamanders, wild, animals, are, kept, as, pets, the, term, wild, in, this, context, specifically, applies, to, any, species, of, animal, which, has, not, undergone, a, fundamental, change, in, behavior, to, facilitate, a, close, co, existence, with, humans, some, species, may, have, been, bred, in, captivity, for, a, considerable, length, of, time, but, are, still, not, recognized, as, domesticated, generally, wild, animals, are, recognized, as, not, suitable, to, keep, as, pets, and, this, practice, is, completely, banned, in, many, places, in, other, areas, certain, species, are, allowed, to, be, kept, and, it, is, usually, required, for, the, owner, to, obtain, a, permit, it, is, considered, animal, cruelty, by, some, as, most, often, wild, animals, require, precise, and, constant, care, that, is, very, difficult, to, meet, in, captive, conditions, many, large, and, instinctively, aggressive, animals, are, extremely, dangerous, and, numerous, times, have, they, killed, their, handlers, archaeology, suggests, that, human, ownership, of, dogs, as, pets, may, date, back, to, at, least, 12, 000, years, ago, ancient, greeks, and, romans, would, openly, grieve, for, the, loss, of, a, dog, evidenced, by, inscriptions, left, on, tombstones, commemorating, their, loss, the, surviving, epitaphs, dedicated, to, horses, are, more, likely, to, reference, a, gratitude, for, the, companionship, that, had, come, from, war, horses, rather, than, race, horses, the, latter, may, have, chiefly, been, commemorated, as, a, way, to, further, the, owner, s, fame, and, glory, in, ancient, egypt, dogs, and, baboons, were, kept, as, pets, and, buried, with, their, owners, dogs, were, given, names, which, is, significant, as, egyptians, considered, names, to, have, magical, properties, throughout, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, pet, keeping, in, the, modern, sense, gradually, became, accepted, throughout, britain, initially, aristocrats, kept, dogs, for, both, companionship, and, hunting, thus, pet, keeping, was, a, sign, of, elitism, within, society, by, the, 19th, century, the, rise, of, the, middle, class, stimulated, the, development, of, pet, keeping, and, it, became, inscribed, within, the, bourgeois, culture, as, the, popularity, of, pet, keeping, in, the, modern, sense, rose, during, the, victorian, era, animals, became, a, fixture, within, urban, culture, as, commodities, and, decorative, objects, pet, keeping, generated, a, commercial, opportunity, for, entrepreneurs, by, the, mid, 19th, century, nearly, twenty, thousand, street, vendors, in, london, dealt, with, live, animals, the, popularity, of, animals, also, developed, a, demand, for, animal, goods, such, as, accessories, and, guides, for, pet, keeping, pet, care, developed, into, a, big, business, by, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, profiteers, also, sought, out, pet, stealing, as, a, means, for, economic, gain, utilizing, the, affection, that, owners, had, for, their, pets, professional, dog, stealers, would, capture, animals, and, hold, them, for, ransom, the, development, of, dog, stealing, reflects, the, increased, value, of, pets, pets, gradually, became, defined, as, the, property, of, their, owners, laws, were, created, that, punished, offenders, for, their, burglary, pets, and, animals, also, had, social, and, cultural, implications, throughout, the, nineteenth, century, the, categorization, of, dogs, by, their, breeds, reflected, the, hierarchical, social, order, of, the, victorian, era, the, pedigree, of, a, dog, represented, the, high, status, and, lineage, of, their, owners, and, reinforced, social, stratification, middle, class, owners, valued, the, ability, to, associate, with, the, upper, class, through, ownership, of, their, pets, the, ability, to, care, for, a, pet, signified, respectability, and, the, capability, to, be, self, sufficient, according, to, harriet, ritvo, the, identification, of, elite, animal, and, elite, owner, was, not, a, confirmation, of, the, owner, s, status, but, a, way, of, redefining, it, the, popularity, of, dog, and, pet, keeping, generated, animal, fancy, dog, fanciers, showed, enthusiasm, for, owning, pets, breeding, dogs, and, showing, dogs, in, various, shows, the, first, dog, show, took, place, on, 28, june, 1859, in, newcastle, and, focused, mostly, on, sporting, and, hunting, dogs, however, pet, owners, produced, an, eagerness, to, demonstrate, their, pets, as, well, as, have, an, outlet, to, compete, thus, pet, animals, gradually, were, included, within, dog, shows, the, first, large, show, which, would, host, one, thousand, entries, took, place, in, chelsea, in, 1863, the, kennel, club, was, created, in, 1873, to, ensure, fairness, and, organization, within, dog, shows, the, development, of, the, stud, book, by, the, kennel, club, defined, policies, presented, a, national, registry, system, of, purebred, dogs, and, essentially, institutionalized, dog, shows, pet, ownership, by, animals, in, the, wild, as, an, analogue, to, the, human, phenomenon, has, not, been, observed, and, is, likely, non, existent, in, nature, one, group, of, capuchin, monkeys, was, observed, appearing, to, care, for, a, marmoset, a, fellow, new, world, monkey, species, however, observations, of, chimpanzees, apparently, playing, with, small, animals, like, hyraxes, have, ended, with, the, chimpanzees, killing, the, animals, and, tossing, the, corpses, around, a, 2010, study, states, that, human, relationships, with, animals, have, an, exclusive, human, cognitive, component, and, that, pet, keeping, is, a, fundamental, and, ancient, attribute, of, the, human, species, anthropomorphism, or, the, projection, of, human, feelings, thoughts, and, attributes, on, to, animals, is, a, defining, feature, of, human, pet, keeping, the, study, identifies, it, as, the, same, trait, in, evolution, responsible, for, domestication, and, concern, for, animal, welfare, it, is, estimated, to, have, arisen, at, least, 100, 000, years, before, present, ybp, in, homo, sapiens, it, is, debated, whether, this, redirection, of, human, nurturing, behaviour, towards, non, human, animals, in, the, form, of, pet, keeping, was, maladaptive, due, to, being, biologically, costly, or, whether, it, was, positively, selected, for, two, studies, suggest, that, the, human, ability, to, domesticate, and, keep, pets, came, from, the, same, fundamental, evolutionary, trait, and, that, this, trait, provided, a, material, benefit, in, the, form, of, domestication, that, was, sufficiently, adaptive, to, be, positively, selected, for, 300, a, 2011, study, suggests, that, the, practical, functions, that, some, pets, provide, such, as, assisting, hunting, or, removing, pests, could, have, resulted, in, enough, evolutionary, advantage, to, allow, for, the, persistence, of, this, behaviour, in, humans, and, outweigh, the, economic, burden, held, by, pets, kept, as, playthings, for, immediate, emotional, rewards, two, other, studies, suggest, that, the, behaviour, constitutes, an, error, side, effect, or, misapplication, of, the, evolved, mechanisms, responsible, for, human, empathy, and, theory, of, mind, to, cover, non, human, animals, which, has, not, sufficiently, impacted, its, evolutionary, advantage, in, the, long, run, 300, animals, in, captivity, with, the, help, of, caretakers, have, been, considered, to, have, owned, pets, examples, of, this, include, koko, the, gorilla, who, had, several, pet, cats, tonda, the, orangutan, and, a, pet, cat, and, tarra, the, elephant, and, a, dog, named, bella
