rules, were, officially, adopted, by, the, fivb, in, 2002, beach, volleyball, is, fundamentally, similar, to, indoor, volleyball, however, there, are, several, differences, between, the, two, games, that, affect, players, strategies, gameplay, and, techniques, the, main, differences, in, the, rules, of, beach, and, indoor, volleyball, for, international, competitions, governed, by, the, fivb, include, the, teams, start, on, opposite, sides, of, the, net, one, team, is, designated, the, serving, team, and, opposing, team, is, the, receiving, team, a, coin, toss, is, conducted, by, the, referee, before, the, warm, ups, to, determine, which, team, serves, first, and, which, sides, of, the, court, the, teams, start, on, for, the, first, two, sets, if, a, third, deciding, set, is, needed, another, coin, toss, will, be, conducted, prior, to, the, third, set, the, service, order, decided, at, the, coin, toss, before, a, set, is, maintained, throughout, the, set, for, each, point, a, player, from, the, serving, team, initiates, the, serve, by, tossing, the, ball, into, the, air, and, attempting, to, hit, the, ball, so, it, passes, over, the, net, on, a, course, such, that, it, will, land, in, the, opposing, team, s, court, the, opposing, team, must, use, a, combination, of, no, more, than, three, contacts, with, the, ball, to, return, the, ball, to, the, opponent, s, side, of, the, net, and, individual, players, may, not, touch, the, ball, twice, consecutively, except, after, a, block, touch, the, three, contacts, usually, consist, first, of, the, bump, or, pass, by, the, receiving, player, second, of, the, set, by, the, receiving, player, s, teammate, so, that, the, ball, s, trajectory, is, aimed, towards, a, spot, where, the, receiving, player, can, hit, it, and, third, by, the, receiving, player, who, spikes, jumping, raising, one, arm, above, the, head, and, hitting, the, ball, so, it, will, move, quickly, down, to, the, ground, on, the, opponent, s, court, or, shoots, to, return, the, ball, over, the, net, the, team, with, possession, of, the, ball, that, is, trying, to, attack, the, ball, as, described, is, said, to, be, on, offense, the, team, on, defense, attempts, to, prevent, the, attacking, team, from, directing, the, ball, into, their, court, a, player, at, the, net, jumps, and, reaches, above, the, top, and, if, possible, across, the, plane, of, the, net, to, block, the, attacked, ball, if, the, ball, is, hit, around, above, or, through, the, block, the, defensive, player, positioned, behind, the, blocker, attempts, to, control, the, ball, with, a, dig, usually, a, forearm, pass, after, a, successful, dig, the, team, transitions, to, offense, the, game, continues, in, this, manner, rallying, back, and, forth, until, the, ball, touches, the, court, or, until, a, fault, is, committed, teams, switch, ends, of, the, court, after, every, seven, points, sets, 1, and, 2, and, five, points, set, 3, played, there, is, a, technical, time, out, when, the, total, points, of, both, teams, add, up, to, 21, each, team, may, also, request, one, additional, time, out, per, set, while, there, are, no, fixed, positions, competitive, players, generally, have, specialized, defensive, and, offensive, roles, on, defense, players, may, specialize, as, either, a, blocker, or, a, defender, some, competitive, teams, have, no, specializations, with, the, two, players, taking, turns, blocking, and, playing, defense, this, style, of, play, is, known, as, split, blocking, and, allows, teams, to, conserve, energy, since, the, demand, for, energy, on, the, sand, is, higher, on, offense, players, tend, to, specialize, in, playing, on, either, the, right, side, or, left, side, of, the, court, this, allows, for, greater, consistency, in, receiving, serve, and, shot, selection, left, handed, players, generally, prefer, to, play, on, the, right, side, while, right, handed, players, generally, prefer, to, play, on, the, left, side, as, it, is, easier, to, spike, a, ball, that, has, not, passed, across, the, line, of, one, s, body, a, player, who, is, playing, on, the, opposite, side, of, their, handedness, is, said, to, be, playing, on, the, on, hand, side, while, a, player, playing, on, the, same, side, as, their, handedness, is, playing, on, the, off, hand, side, the, ball, may, touch, any, part, of, the, body, except, during, the, serve, when, only, the, hand, or, arm, may, make, contact, but, must, be, hit, not, caught, or, thrown, during, a, hit, a, player, may, only, make, contact, with, the, ball, one, time, when, two, players, from, the, same, team, contact, the, ball, simultaneously, it, is, counted, as, two, hits, and, either, player, may, make, the, next, contact, when, two, players, from, opposing, teams, contact, the, ball, simultaneously, over, the, net, in, what, is, known, as, a, joust, the, team, whose, side, the, ball, ends, up, on, is, entitled, to, another, three, contacts, when, receiving, a, ball, overhand, with, fingers, from, a, hit, that, is, not, hard, driven, the, ball, must, be, contacted, cleanly, if, a, player, receives, the, ball, open, handed, the, contact, of, each, hand, with, the, ball, must, be, exactly, simultaneous, in, practice, this, means, that, serves, are, never, received, open, handed, when, receiving, an, opponent, s, hard, driven, attack, a, double, contact, provided, both, contacts, occur, in, a, single, action, and, or, a, slight, lift, of, the, ball, is, allowed, in, particular, in, defensive, action, of, a, hard, driven, ball, the, ball, can, be, held, momentarily, overhand, with, the, fingers, attack, hits, using, an, open, handed, tip, or, dink, directing, the, ball, with, the, fingers, are, illegal, as, are, attack, hits, using, an, overhand, pass, to, direct, the, ball, on, a, trajectory, not, perpendicular, to, the, line, of, the, shoulders, overhand, passes, which, accidentally, cross, over, the, net, are, an, exception, these, differences, between, the, rules, of, indoor, volleyball, and, beach, volleyball, strongly, affect, tactics, and, techniques, beach, volleyball, players, use, hand, signals, to, indicate, to, their, partners, the, type, of, block, they, either, intend, to, make, if, they, are, the, designated, blocker, or, that, they, want, their, partner, to, make, if, they, are, the, designated, defender, block, signals, are, important, so, that, both, the, blocker, and, defender, know, which, area, of, the, court, is, their, responsibility, to, cover, block, signals, are, made, behind, the, back, to, hide, them, from, the, opposing, team, they, are, usually, given, with, both, hands, by, the, serving, player, s, partner, prior, to, the, serve, with, the, left, hand, referring, to, the, type, of, block, that, should, be, put, up, against, the, left, side, attacker, and, the, right, hand, similarly, referring, to, the, right, side, attacker, a, player, may, also, wiggle, or, flash, one, block, signal, to, indicate, which, opponent, to, serve, to, block, signals, may, also, be, given, during, a, rally, while, the, opposing, team, is, preparing, their, attack, note, for, some, teams, closed, fist, and, open, hand, signals, have, the, opposite, meaning, of, blocking, if, the, partner, is, showing, the, closed, fist, the, blocker, should, block, ball, and, open, hand, means, that, the, blocker, should, pull, off, the, net, there, are, several, basic, skills, competitive, players, need, to, master, serving, passing, setting, attacking, blocking, and, digging, serving, is, the, act, of, putting, the, ball, into, play, by, striking, it, with, the, hand, or, arm, from, behind, the, rear, court, boundary, it, can, take, the, form, of, an, underhand, serve, or, an, overhand, serve, and, examples, include, float, serve, jump, float, serve, top, spin, serve, jump, serve, sky, ball, serve, and, reverse, sky, ball, serve, as, beach, volleyball, is, usually, played, outdoors, the, direction, and, speed, of, the, wind, and, the, position, of, the, sun, are, considered, when, choosing, which, serve, to, use, wind, can, significantly, affect, the, trajectory, of, a, serve, and, so, players, can, employ, different, serving, strategies, to, take, advantage, of, the, wind, conditions, for, example, players, may, choose, a, top, spin, serve, when, serving, into, the, wind, causing, the, ball, to, drop, short, in, front, of, the, passer, players, can, also, take, advantage, of, the, position, of, the, sun, for, example, a, sky, ball, serve, is, especially, effective, at, high, noon, because, the, sun, gets, into, the, passer, s, eyes, and, can, cause, the, passer, to, become, disoriented, another, factor, the, server, considers, is, choosing, which, of, the, two, opposing, players, to, serve, the, ball, to, because, of, the, three, contact, rule, the, player, who, receives, the, serve, will, likely, also, be, the, attacker, and, serving, strategies, can, thus, target, an, opposing, player, s, relative, weakness, in, passing, setting, or, attacking, although, the, serve, can, be, used, as, an, offensive, weapon, most, rallies, are, won, by, the, receiving, team, as, they, have, the, first, attack, opportunity, the, pass, is, the, first, of, a, team, s, 3, allowed, contacts, in, indoor, volleyball, passing, involves, two, main, techniques, forearm, pass, or, bump, where, the, ball, touches, the, inside, part, of, the, joined, forearms, or, platform, at, waist, line, and, overhand, pass, where, it, is, handled, with, the, fingertips, like, a, hand, set, above, the, head, however, unlike, indoors, you, may, not, double, contact, the, first, ball, using, overhand, with, fingers, action, on, the, beach, in, practice, this, means, that, bump, pass, is, much, more, popular, in, beach, volleyball, similarly, beach, players, rarely, use, an, overhand, passing, motion, as, the, first, except, on, a, hard, driven, attack, or, last, of, the, three, allowed, team, contacts, digging, is, a, similar, skill, to, passing, but, the, term, is, not, used, to, describe, receiving, the, serve, or, a, free, ball, but, rather, refers, to, an, attempt, to, prevent, an, opponent, s, attack, hit, from, touching, the, court, the, set, is, the, second, team, contact, and, its, purpose, is, to, position, the, ball, for, an, attack, on, the, third, hit, similar, to, a, pass, the, ball, can, be, set, with, either, a, forearm, pass, technique, known, as, a, bump, set, or, an, overhand, pass, technique, known, as, a, hand, set, due, to, the, environmental, factors, that, make, it, harder, to, hand, set, a, ball, cleanly, the, bump, set, is, more, common, in, the, beach, game, when, hand, setting, the, player, s, hands, must, contact, the, ball, simultaneously, if, a, referee, determines, that, a, double, hit, has, occurred, the, point, will, be, given, to, the, other, team, excessive, spin, after, a, ball, has, been, set, is, often, used, as, an, indicator, of, a, double, contact, fault, but, causing, a, ball, to, spin, while, setting, is, not, explicitly, prohibited, after, completing, the, contact, the, setter, typically, turns, their, attention, to, the, defense, and, communicates, to, their, partner, whether, a, blocker, is, up, and, which, area, of, the, court, is, open, the, second, contact, can, also, be, used, to, attack, the, ball, known, as, an, over, on, two, attack, a, beach, volleyball, attack, can, be, categorized, as, either, a, spike, or, a, shot, a, spike, involves, hitting, the, ball, hard, with, one, open, hand, on, a, downward, trajectory, from, above, the, top, of, the, net, a, shot, is, a, relatively, soft, attack, used, to, place, a, ball, into, an, open, undefended, area, of, the, court, unlike, indoor, volleyball, a, wide, variety, of, shots, are, utilized, in, beach, volleyball, due, to, the, fewer, defenders, on, court, common, shots, used, in, beach, volleyball, include, roll, shots, in, which, the, attacker, puts, a, lot, of, topspin, on, the, ball, so, that, it, has, an, arcing, trajectory, that, will, go, over, the, block, then, drop, quickly, cut, shots, in, which, the, shot, crosses, the, net, at, sharp, angles, pokeys, in, which, the, ball, is, contacted, with, the, attacking, player, s, knuckles, and, dinks, in, which, the, ball, is, directed, very, softly, low, over, the, net, a, block, can, be, used, to, score, a, direct, point, by, directing, an, attack, back, into, the, opponent, s, court, channel, an, attack, to, the, defender, by, taking, away, part, of, the, court, or, slow, down, the, ball, so, the, defender, has, time, to, chase, it, down, at, the, competitive, level, blockers, will, often, reach, across, the, net, and, penetrate, the, opposing, team, s, side, as, much, as, possible, to, take, away, more, hitting, angles, blockers, may, also, attempt, a, shot, block, where, instead, of, maximum, penetration, across, the, net, the, blocker, reaches, with, their, hands, as, high, as, possible, to, achieve, maximum, height, above, the, net, players, often, decide, against, blocking, if, the, opposing, team, s, pass, and, set, are, not, in, a, good, position, to, produce, a, spike, attack, and, instead, opt, to, retreat, and, play, defense, this, skill, is, known, as, peeling, dropping, or, pulling, off, the, net, and, is, almost, exclusive, to, beach, volleyball, the, primary, international, governing, body, for, beach, volleyball, is, the, f, d, ration, internationale, de,
