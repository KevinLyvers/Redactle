milk, is, a, white, liquid, food, produced, by, the, mammary, glands, of, mammals, it, is, the, primary, source, of, nutrition, for, young, mammals, including, breastfed, human, infants, before, they, are, able, to, digest, solid, food, immune, factors, and, immune, modulating, components, in, milk, contribute, to, milk, immunity, early, lactation, milk, which, is, called, colostrum, contains, antibodies, that, strengthen, the, immune, system, and, thus, reduce, the, risk, of, many, diseases, milk, contains, many, nutrients, including, calcium, and, protein, but, also, lactose, and, saturated, fat, as, an, agricultural, product, dairy, milk, is, collected, from, farm, animals, in, 2011, dairy, farms, produced, around, 730, million, tonnes, 800, million, short, tons, of, milk, from, 260, million, dairy, cows, india, is, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, milk, and, the, leading, exporter, of, skimmed, milk, powder, but, it, exports, few, other, milk, products, because, there, is, an, ever, increasing, demand, for, dairy, products, in, india, it, could, eventually, become, a, net, importer, of, dairy, products, new, zealand, germany, and, the, netherlands, are, the, largest, exporters, of, milk, products, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, recommends, that, children, over, the, age, of, 12, months, should, have, two, servings, of, dairy, milk, products, a, day, more, than, six, billion, people, worldwide, consume, milk, and, milk, products, and, between, 750, and, 900, million, people, live, in, dairy, farming, households, the, term, milk, comes, from, old, english, meoluc, west, saxon, milc, anglian, from, proto, germanic, meluks, milk, source, also, of, old, norse, mjolk, old, frisian, melok, old, saxon, miluk, dutch, melk, old, high, german, miluh, german, milch, gothic, miluks, since, 1961, the, term, milk, has, been, defined, under, codex, alimentarius, standards, as, the, normal, mammary, secretion, of, milking, animals, obtained, from, one, or, more, milkings, without, either, addition, to, it, or, extraction, from, it, intended, for, consumption, as, liquid, milk, or, for, further, processing, the, term, dairy, refers, to, animal, milk, and, animal, milk, production, there, are, two, distinct, categories, of, milk, consumption, all, infant, mammals, drink, milk, directly, from, their, mothers, bodies, and, it, is, their, primary, source, of, nutrition, and, humans, obtain, milk, from, other, mammals, for, consumption, by, humans, of, all, ages, as, one, component, of, a, varied, diet, in, almost, all, mammals, milk, is, fed, to, infants, through, breastfeeding, either, directly, or, by, expressing, the, milk, to, be, stored, and, consumed, later, the, early, milk, from, mammals, is, called, colostrum, colostrum, contains, antibodies, that, provide, protection, to, the, newborn, baby, as, well, as, nutrients, and, growth, factors, the, makeup, of, the, colostrum, and, the, period, of, secretion, varies, from, species, to, species, for, humans, the, world, health, organization, recommends, exclusive, breastfeeding, for, six, months, and, breastfeeding, in, addition, to, other, food, for, up, to, two, years, of, age, or, more, in, some, cultures, it, is, common, to, breastfeed, children, for, three, to, five, years, and, the, period, may, be, longer, fresh, goats, milk, is, sometimes, substituted, for, breast, milk, which, introduces, the, risk, of, the, child, developing, electrolyte, imbalances, metabolic, acidosis, megaloblastic, anemia, and, a, host, of, allergic, reactions, in, many, cultures, especially, in, the, west, humans, continue, to, consume, milk, beyond, infancy, using, the, milk, of, other, mammals, especially, cattle, goats, and, sheep, as, a, food, product, initially, the, ability, to, digest, milk, was, limited, to, children, as, adults, did, not, produce, lactase, an, enzyme, necessary, for, digesting, the, lactose, in, milk, people, therefore, converted, milk, to, curd, cheese, and, other, products, to, reduce, the, levels, of, lactose, thousands, of, years, ago, a, chance, mutation, spread, in, human, populations, in, northwestern, europe, that, enabled, the, production, of, lactase, in, adulthood, this, mutation, allowed, milk, to, be, used, as, a, new, source, of, nutrition, which, could, sustain, populations, when, other, food, sources, failed, milk, is, processed, into, a, variety, of, products, such, as, cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice, cream, and, cheese, modern, industrial, processes, use, milk, to, produce, casein, whey, protein, lactose, condensed, milk, powdered, milk, and, many, other, food, additives, and, industrial, products, whole, milk, butter, and, cream, have, high, levels, of, saturated, fat, the, sugar, lactose, is, found, only, in, milk, and, possibly, in, forsythia, flowers, and, a, few, tropical, shrubs, lactase, the, enzyme, needed, to, digest, lactose, reaches, its, highest, levels, in, the, human, small, intestine, immediately, after, birth, and, then, begins, a, slow, decline, unless, milk, is, consumed, regularly, those, groups, who, continue, to, tolerate, milk, have, often, exercised, great, creativity, in, using, the, milk, of, domesticated, ungulates, not, only, cattle, but, also, sheep, goats, yaks, water, buffalo, horses, reindeer, and, camels, india, is, the, largest, producer, and, consumer, of, cattle, milk, and, buffalo, milk, in, the, world, humans, first, learned, to, consume, the, milk, of, other, mammals, regularly, following, the, domestication, of, animals, during, the, neolithic, revolution, or, the, development, of, agriculture, this, development, occurred, independently, in, several, global, locations, from, as, early, as, 9000, 7000, bc, in, mesopotamia, to, 3500, 3000, bc, in, the, americas, people, first, domesticated, the, most, important, dairy, animals, cattle, sheep, and, goats, in, southwest, asia, although, domestic, cattle, had, been, independently, derived, from, wild, aurochs, populations, several, times, since, initially, animals, were, kept, for, meat, and, archaeologist, andrew, sherratt, has, suggested, that, dairying, along, with, the, exploitation, of, domestic, animals, for, hair, and, labor, began, much, later, in, a, separate, secondary, products, revolution, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, sherratt, s, model, is, not, supported, by, recent, findings, based, on, the, analysis, of, lipid, residue, in, prehistoric, pottery, that, shows, that, dairying, was, practiced, in, the, early, phases, of, agriculture, in, southwest, asia, by, at, least, the, seventh, millennium, bc, from, southwest, asia, domestic, dairy, animals, spread, to, europe, beginning, around, 7000, bc, but, did, not, reach, britain, and, scandinavia, until, after, 4000, bc, and, south, asia, 7000, 5500, bc, the, first, farmers, in, central, europe, and, britain, milked, their, animals, pastoral, and, pastoral, nomadic, economies, which, rely, predominantly, or, exclusively, on, domestic, animals, and, their, products, rather, than, crop, farming, were, developed, as, european, farmers, moved, into, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, and, subsequently, spread, across, much, of, the, eurasian, steppe, sheep, and, goats, were, introduced, to, africa, from, southwest, asia, but, african, cattle, may, have, been, independently, domesticated, around, 7000, 6000, bc, camels, domesticated, in, central, arabia, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, have, also, been, used, as, dairy, animals, in, north, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, the, earliest, egyptian, records, of, burn, treatments, describe, burn, dressings, using, milk, from, mothers, of, male, babies, in, the, rest, of, the, world, i, e, east, and, southeast, asia, the, americas, and, australia, milk, and, dairy, products, were, historically, not, a, large, part, of, the, diet, either, because, they, remained, populated, by, hunter, gatherers, who, did, not, keep, animals, or, the, local, agricultural, economies, did, not, include, domesticated, dairy, species, milk, consumption, became, common, in, these, regions, comparatively, recently, as, a, consequence, of, european, colonialism, and, political, domination, over, much, of, the, world, in, the, last, 500, years, in, the, middle, ages, milk, was, called, the, virtuous, white, liquor, because, alcoholic, beverages, were, safer, to, consume, than, the, water, generally, available, incorrectly, thought, to, be, blood, diverted, from, the, womb, to, the, breast, it, was, also, known, as, white, blood, and, treated, like, blood, for, religious, dietary, purposes, and, in, humoral, theory, james, rosier, s, record, of, the, 1605, voyage, made, by, george, weymouth, to, new, england, reported, that, the, wabanaki, people, weymouth, captured, in, maine, milked, rain, deere, and, fallo, deere, but, journalist, avery, yale, kamila, and, food, historians, said, rosier, misinterpreted, the, evidence, historians, report, the, wabanaki, did, not, domesticate, deer, the, tribes, of, the, northern, woodlands, have, historically, been, making, nut, milk, cows, were, imported, to, new, england, in, 1624, the, growth, in, urban, population, coupled, with, the, expansion, of, the, railway, network, in, the, mid, 19th, century, brought, about, a, revolution, in, milk, production, and, supply, individual, railway, firms, began, transporting, milk, from, rural, areas, to, london, from, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, possibly, the, first, such, instance, was, in, 1846, when, st, thomas, s, hospital, in, southwark, contracted, with, milk, suppliers, outside, london, to, ship, milk, by, rail, the, great, western, railway, was, an, early, and, enthusiastic, adopter, and, began, to, transport, milk, into, london, from, maidenhead, in, 1860, despite, much, criticism, by, 1900, the, company, was, transporting, over, 25, million, imperial, gallons, 110, million, litres, 30, million, us, gallons, annually, the, milk, trade, grew, slowly, through, the, 1860s, but, went, through, a, period, of, extensive, structural, change, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, urban, demand, began, to, grow, as, consumer, purchasing, power, increased, and, milk, became, regarded, as, a, required, daily, commodity, over, the, last, three, decades, of, the, 19th, century, demand, for, milk, in, most, parts, of, the, country, doubled, or, in, some, cases, tripled, legislation, in, 1875, made, the, adulteration, of, milk, illegal, this, combined, with, a, marketing, campaign, to, change, the, image, of, milk, the, proportion, of, rural, imports, by, rail, as, a, percentage, of, total, milk, consumption, in, london, grew, from, under, 5, in, the, 1860s, to, over, 96, by, the, early, 20th, century, by, that, point, the, supply, system, for, milk, was, the, most, highly, organized, and, integrated, of, any, food, product, milk, was, analyzed, for, infection, with, tuberculosis, in, 1907, 180, samples, were, tested, in, birmingham, and, 13, 3, were, found, to, be, infected, the, first, glass, bottle, packaging, for, milk, was, used, in, the, 1870s, the, first, company, to, do, so, may, have, been, the, new, york, dairy, company, in, 1877, the, express, dairy, company, in, england, began, glass, bottle, production, in, 1880, in, 1884, hervey, thatcher, an, american, inventor, from, new, york, invented, a, glass, milk, bottle, called, thatcher, s, common, sense, milk, jar, which, was, sealed, with, a, waxed, paper, disk, in, 1932, plastic, coated, paper, milk, cartons, were, introduced, commercially, in, 1863, french, chemist, and, biologist, louis, pasteur, invented, pasteurization, a, method, of, killing, harmful, bacteria, in, beverages, and, food, products, he, developed, this, method, while, on, summer, vacation, in, arbois, to, remedy, the, frequent, acidity, of, the, local, wines, he, found, out, experimentally, that, it, is, sufficient, to, heat, a, young, wine, to, only, about, 50, 60, c, 122, 140, f, for, a, brief, time, to, kill, the, microbes, and, that, the, wine, could, be, nevertheless, properly, aged, without, sacrificing, the, final, quality, in, honor, of, pasteur, the, process, became, known, as, pasteurization, pasteurization, was, originally, used, as, a, way, of, preventing, wine, and, beer, from, souring, commercial, pasteurizing, equipment, was, produced, in, germany, in, the, 1880s, and, producers, adopted, the, process, in, copenhagen, and, stockholm, by, 1885, all, mammal, species, have, females, who, can, produce, milk, for, some, time, after, giving, birth, cow, milk, dominates, the, amount, of, milk, produced, in, 2011, fao, estimates, 85, of, all, milk, worldwide, was, produced, from, cows, human, milk, is, not, produced, or, distributed, industrially, or, commercially, however, human, milk, banks, collect, donated, human, breastmilk, and, redistribute, it, to, infants, who, may, benefit, from, human, milk, for, various, reasons, premature, neonates, babies, with, allergies, metabolic, diseases, etc, but, who, cannot, breastfeed, actual, inability, to, produce, enough, milk, is, rare, with, studies, showing, that, mothers, from, malnourished, regions, still, produce, amounts, of, milk, of, similar, quality, to, that, of, mothers, in, developed, countries, there, are, many, reasons, a, mother, may, not, produce, enough, breast, milk, the, amount, of, milk, produced, depends, on, how, often, the, mother, is, nursing, and, or, pumping, the, more, the, mother, nurses, her, baby, or, pumps, the, more, milk, is, produced, in, the, western, world, cow, s, milk, is, produced, on, an, industrial, scale, and, is, by, far, the, most, commonly, consumed, form, of, milk, commercial, dairy, farming, using, automated, milking, equipment, produces, the, vast, majority, of, milk, in, developed, countries, dairy, cattle, such, as, the, holstein, have, been, bred, selectively, for, increased, milk, production, about, 90, of, the, dairy, cows, in, the, united, states, and, 85, in, great, britain, are, holsteins, other, dairy, cows, in, the, united, states, include, ayrshire, brown, swiss, guernsey, jersey, and, milking, shorthorn, dairy, shorthorn, aside, from, cattle, many, kinds, of, livestock, provide, milk, used, by, humans, for, dairy, products, these, animals, include, water, buffalo, goat, sheep, camel, donkey, horse, reindeer, and, yak, the, first, four, respectively, produced, about, 11, 2, 1, 4, and, 0, 2, of, all, milk, worldwide, in, 2011, in, russia, and, sweden, small, moose, dairies, also, exist, according, to, the, us, national, bison, association, american, bison, also, called, american, buffalo, are, not, milked, commercially, however, various, sources, report, cows, resulting, from, cross, breeding, bison, and, domestic, cattle, are, good, milk, producers, and, have, been, used, both, during, the, european, settlement, of, north, america, and, during, the, development, of, commercial, beefalo, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, swine, are, almost, never, milked, even, though, their, milk, is, similar, to, cow, s, milk, and, perfectly, suitable, for, human, consumption, the, main, reasons, for, this, are, that, milking, a, sow, s, numerous, small, teats, is, very, cumbersome, and, that, sows, cannot, store, their, milk, as, cows, can, a, few, pig, farms, do, sell, pig, cheese, as, a, novelty, item, these, cheeses, are, exceedingly, expensive, in, 2012, the, largest, producer, of, milk, and, milk, products, was, india, followed, by, the, united, states, of, america, china, pakistan, and, brazil, all, 28, european, union, members, together, produced, 153, 8, million, tonnes, 169, 5, million, short, tons, of, milk, in, 2013, the, largest, by, any, politico, economic, union, increasing, affluence, in, developing, countries, as, well, as, increased, promotion, of, milk, and, milk, products, has, led, to, a, rise, in, milk, consumption, in, developing, countries, in, recent, years, in, turn, the, opportunities, presented, by, these, growing, markets, have, attracted, investments, by, multinational, dairy, firms, nevertheless, in, many, countries, production, remains, on, a, small, scale, and, presents, significant, opportunities, for, diversification, of, income, sources, by, small, farms, local, milk, collection, centers, where, milk, is, collected, and, chilled, prior, to, being, transferred, to, urban, dairies, are, a, good, example, of, where, farmers, have, been, able, to, work, on, a, cooperative, basis, particularly, in, countries, such, as, india, fao, reports, israel, dairy, farms, are, the, most, productive, in, the, world, with, a, yield, of, 12, 546, kilograms, 27, 659, lb, milk, per, cow, per, year, this, survey, over, 2001, and, 2007, was, conducted, by, icar, international, committee, for, animal, recording, across, 17, developed, countries, the, survey, found, that, the, average, herd, size, in, these, developed, countries, increased, from, 74, to, 99, cows, per, herd, between, 2001, and, 2007, a, dairy, farm, had, an, average, of, 19, cows, per, herd, in, norway, and, 337, in, new, zealand, annual, milk, production, in, the, same, period, increased, from, 7, 726, to, 8, 550, kg, 17, 033, to, 18, 850, lb, per, cow, in, these, developed, countries, the, lowest, average, production, was, in, new, zealand, at, 3, 974, kg, 8, 761, lb, per, cow, the, milk, yield, per, cow, depended, on, production, systems, nutrition, of, the, cows, and, only, to, a, minor, extent, different, genetic, potential, of, the, animals, what, the, cow, ate, made, the, most, impact, on, the, production, obtained, new, zealand, cows, with, the, lowest, yield, per, year, grazed, all, year, in, contrast, to, israel, with, the, highest, yield, where, the, cows, ate, in, barns, with, an, energy, rich, mixed, diet, the, milk, yield, per, cow, in, the, united, states, was, 9, 954, kg, 21, 945, lb, per, year, in, 2010, in, contrast, the, milk, yields, per, cow, in, india, and, china, the, second, and, third, largest, producers, were, respectively, 1, 154, kg, 2, 544, lb, and, 2, 282, kg, 5, 031, lb, per, year, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, mentions, the, possibility, that, the, already, recorded, stagnation, of, dairy, production, in, both, china, and, west, africa, can, be, attributed, to, persistent, increases, in, heat, stress, caused, by, climate, change, 747, this, is, a, plausible, hypothesis, because, even, mild, heat, stress, can, reduce, daily, yields, research, in, sweden, found, that, average, daily, temperatures, of, 20, 25, c, 68, 77, f, reduce, daily, milk, yield, per, cow, by, 0, 2, kg, with, the, loss, reaching, 0, 54, kg, for, 25, 30, c, 77, 86, f, research, in, a, humid, tropical, climate, describes, a, more, linear, relationship, with, every, unit, of, heat, stress, reducing, yield, by, 2, 13, in, the, intensive, farming, systems, daily, milk, yield, per, cow, declines, by, 1, 8, kg, during, severe, heat, stress, in, organic, farming, systems, the, effect, of, heat, stress, on, milk, yields, is, limited, but, milk, quality, suffers, substantially, with, lower, fat, and, protein, content, in, china, daily, milk, production, per, cow, is, already, lower, than, the, average, by, between, 0, 7, and, 4, kg, in, july, the, hottest, month, of, the, year, and, by, 2070, it, may, decline, by, up, to, 50, or, 7, 2, kg, due, to, climate, change, heatwaves, can, also, reduce, milk, yield, with, particularly, acute, impacts, if, the, heatwave, lasts, for, four, or, more, days, as, at, that, point, the, cow, s, thermoregulation, capacity, is, usually, exhausted, and, its, core, body, temperature, starts, to, increase, it, was, reported, in, 2007, that, with, increased, worldwide, prosperity, and, the, competition, of, bio, fuel, production, for, feed, stocks, both, the, demand, for, and, the, price, of, milk, had, substantially, increased, worldwide, particularly, notable, was, the, rapid, increase, of, consumption, of, milk, in, china, and, the, rise, of, the, price, of, milk, in, the, united, states, above, the, government, subsidized, price, in, 2010, the, department, of, agriculture, predicted, farmers, would, receive, an, average, of, 1, 35, per, us, gallon, 0, 36, l, 1, 62, imp, gal, of, cow, s, milk, which, is, down, 30, cents, per, us, gallon, 7, 9, l, 36, imp, gal, from, 2007, and, below, the, break, even, point, for, many, cattle, farmers, milk, is, an, emulsion, or, colloid, of, butterfat, globules, within, a, water, based, fluid, that, contains, dissolved, carbohydrates, and, protein, aggregates, with, minerals, because, it, is, produced, as, a, food, source, for, the, young, all, of, its, contents, provide, benefits, for, growth, the, principal, requirements, are, energy, lipids, lactose, and, protein, biosynthesis, of, non, essential, amino, acids, supplied, by, proteins, essential, amino, acids, and, amino, groups, essential, fatty, acids, vitamins, and, inorganic, elements, and, water, the, ph, of, cow, s, milk, ranging, from, 6, 7, to, 6, 9, is, similar, to, other, bovines, and, non, bovine, mammals, full, fat, milk, contains, about, 33, grams, of, fat, per, liter, including, about, 19, grams, of, saturated, fat, 1, 2, grams, of, omega, 6, fatty, acids, and, 0, 75, grams, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, per, liter, the, amount, of, fat, varies, for, products, where, some, of, the, fat, has, been, removed, such, as, in, skimmed, milk, initially, milk, fat, is, secreted, in, the, form, of, a, fat, globule, surrounded, by, a, membrane, each, fat, globule, is, composed, almost, entirely, of, triacylglycerols, and, is, surrounded, by, a, membrane, consisting, of, complex, lipids, such, as, phospholipids, along, with, proteins, these, act, as, emulsifiers, which, keep, the, individual, globules, from, coalescing, and, protect, the, contents, of, these, globules, from, various, enzymes, in, the, fluid, portion, of, the, milk, although, 97, 98, of, lipids, are, triacylglycerols, small, amounts, of, di, and, monoacylglycerols, free, cholesterol, and, cholesterol, esters, free, fatty, acids, and, phospholipids, are, also, present, unlike, protein, and, carbohydrates, fat, composition, in, milk, varies, widely, due, to, genetic, lactational, and, nutritional, factor, difference, between, different, species, fat, globules, vary, in, size, from, less, than, 0, 2, to, about, 15, micrometers, in, diameter, between, different, species, diameter, may, also, vary, between, animals, within, a, species, and, at, different, times, within, a, milking, of, a, single, animal, in, unhomogenized, cow, s, milk, the, fat, globules, have, an, average, diameter, of, two, to, four, micrometers, and, with, homogenization, average, around, 0, 4, micrometers, the, fat, soluble, vitamins, a, d, e, and, k, along, with, essential, fatty, acids, such, as, linoleic, and, linolenic, acid, are, found, within, the, milk, fat, portion, of, the, milk, normal, bovine, milk, contains, 30, 35, grams, of, protein, per, liter, of, which, about, 80, is, arranged, in, casein, micelles, total, proteins, in, milk, represent, 3, 2, of, its, composition, nutrition, table, the, largest, structures, in, the, fluid, portion, of, the, milk, are, casein, micelles, aggregates, of, several, thousand, protein, molecules, with, superficial, resemblance, to, a, surfactant, micelle, bonded, with, the, help, of, nanometer, scale, particles, of, calcium, phosphate, each, casein, micelle, is, roughly, spherical, and, about, a, tenth, of, a, micrometer, across, there, are, four, different, types, of, casein, proteins, s1, s2, and, caseins, most, of, the, casein, proteins, are, bound, into, the, micelles, there, are, several, competing, theories, regarding, the, precise, structure, of, the, micelles, but, they, share, one, important, feature, the, outermost, layer, consists, of, strands, of, one, type, of, protein, k, casein, reaching, out, from, the, body, of, the, micelle, into, the, surrounding, fluid, these, kappa, casein, molecules, all, have, a, negative, electrical, charge, and, therefore, repel, each, other, keeping, the, micelles, separated, under, normal, conditions, and, in, a, stable, colloidal, suspension, in, the, water, based, surrounding, fluid, milk, contains, dozens, of, other, types, of, proteins, beside, caseins, and, including, enzymes, these, other, proteins, are, more, water, soluble, than, caseins, and, do, not, form, larger, structures, because, the, proteins, remain, suspended, in, whey, remaining, when, caseins, coagulate, into, curds, they, are, collectively, known, as, whey, proteins, lactoglobulin, is, the, most, common, whey, protein, by, a, large, margin, the, ratio, of, caseins, to, whey, proteins, varies, greatly, between, species, for, example, it, is, 82, 18, in, cows, and, around, 32, 68, in, humans, bovine, milk, contains, a, variety, of, cations, and, anions, traditionally, referred, to, as, minerals, or, milk, salts, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and, chloride, are, all, included, and, they, typically, occur, at, concentrations, of, 5, 40, mm, the, milk, salts, strongly, interact, with, casein, most, notably, calcium, phosphate, it, is, present, in, excess, and, often, much, greater, excess, of, solubility, of, solid, calcium, phosphate, in, addition, to, calcium, milk, is, a, source, of, many, vitamins, vitamins, a, b1, b2, b5, b6, b7, b12, and, d, for, many, years, the, most, widely, accepted, theory, of, the, structure, of, a, micelle, was, that, it, was, composed, of, spherical, casein, aggregates, called, submicelles, that, were, held, together, by, calcium, phosphate, linkages, however, there, are, two, recent, models, of, the, casein, micelle, that, refute, the, distinct, micellular, structures, within, the, micelle, the, first, theory, attributed, to, de, kruif, and, holt, proposes, that, nanoclusters, of, calcium, phosphate, and, the, phosphopeptide, fraction, of, beta, casein, are, the, centerpiece, to, micellar, structure, specifically, in, this, view, unstructured, proteins, organize, around, the, calcium, phosphate, giving, rise, to, their, structure, and, thus, no, specific, structure, is, formed, under, the, second, theory, proposed, by, horne, the, growth, of, calcium, phosphate, nanoclusters, begins, the, process, of, micelle, formation, but, is, limited, by, binding, phosphopeptide, loop, regions, of, the, caseins, once, bound, protein, protein, interactions, are, formed, and, polymerization, occurs, in, which, k, casein, is, used, as, an, end, cap, to, form, micelles, with, trapped, calcium, phosphate, nanoclusters, some, sources, indicate, that, the, trapped, calcium, phosphate, is, in, the, form, of, ca, 9, po, 4, 6, whereas, others, say, it, is, similar, to, the, structure, of, the, mineral, brushite, cahpo, 4, 2h, 2, o, milk, contains, several, different, carbohydrates, including, lactose, glucose, galactose, and, other, oligosaccharides, the, lactose, gives, milk, its, sweet, taste, and, contributes, approximately, 40, of, the, calories, in, whole, cow, s, milk, s, lactose, is, a, disaccharide, composite, of, two, simple, sugars, glucose, and, galactose, bovine, milk, averages, 4, 8, anhydrous, lactose, which, amounts, to, about, 50, of, the, total, solids, of, skimmed, milk, levels, of, lactose, are, dependent, upon, the, type, of, milk, as, other, carbohydrates, can, be, present, at, higher, concentrations, than, lactose, in, milks, other, components, found, in, raw, cow, s, milk, are, living, white, blood, cells, mammary, gland, cells, various, bacteria, vitamin, c, and, a, large, number, of, active, enzymes, both, the, fat, globules, and, the, smaller, casein, micelles, which, are, just, large, enough, to, deflect, light, contribute, to, the, opaque, white, color, of, milk, the, fat, globules, contain, some, yellow, orange, carotene, enough, in, some, breeds, such, as, guernsey, and, jersey, cattle, to, impart, a, golden, or, creamy, hue, to, a, glass, of, milk, the, riboflavin, in, the, whey, portion, of, milk, has, a, greenish, color, which, sometimes, can, be, discerned, in, skimmed, milk, or, whey, products, fat, free, skimmed, milk, has, only, the, casein, micelles, to, scatter, light, and, they, tend, to, scatter, shorter, wavelength, blue, light, more, than, they, do, red, giving, skimmed, milk, a, bluish, tint, in, most, western, countries, centralized, dairy, facilities, process, milk, and, products, obtained, from, milk, such, as, cream, butter, and, cheese, in, the, us, these, dairies, usually, are, local, companies, while, in, the, southern, hemisphere, facilities, may, be, run, by, large, multi, national, corporations, such, as, fonterra, pasteurization, is, used, to, kill, harmful, pathogenic, bacteria, such, as, m, paratuberculosis, and, e, coli, 0157, h7, by, heating, the, milk, for, a, short, time, and, then, immediately, cooling, it, types, of, pasteurized, milk, include, full, cream, reduced, fat, skim, milk, calcium, enriched, flavored, and, uht, the, standard, high, temperature, short, time, htst, process, of, 72, c, 162, f, for, 15, seconds, completely, kills, pathogenic, bacteria, in, milk, rendering, it, safe, to, drink, for, up, to, three, weeks, if, continually, refrigerated, dairies, print, best, before, dates, on, each, container, after, which, stores, remove, any, unsold, milk, from, their, shelves, a, side, effect, of, the, heating, of, pasteurization, is, that, some, vitamin, and, mineral, content, is, lost, soluble, calcium, and, phosphorus, decrease, by, 5, thiamin, and, vitamin, b12, by, 10, and, vitamin, c, by, 20, or, greater, even, to, complete, loss, because, losses, are, small, in, comparison, to, the, large, amount, of, the, two, b, vitamins, present, milk, continues, to, provide, significant, amounts, of, thiamin, and, vitamin, b12, the, loss, of, vitamin, c, is, not, nutritionally, significant, in, a, well, balanced, diet, as, milk, is, not, an, important, dietary, source, of, vitamin, c, microfiltration, is, a, process, that, partially, replaces, pasteurization, and, produces, milk, with, fewer, microorganisms, and, longer, shelf, life, without, a, change, in, the, taste, of, the, milk, in, this, process, cream, is, separated, from, the, skimmed, milk, and, is, pasteurized, in, the, usual, way, but, the, skimmed, milk, is, forced, through, ceramic, microfilters, that, trap, 99, 9, of, microorganisms, in, the, milk, as, compared, to, 99, 999, killing, of, microorganisms, in, standard, htst, pasteurization, the, skimmed, milk, then, is, recombined, with, the, pasteurized, cream, to, reconstitute, the, original, milk, composition, ultrafiltration, uses, finer, filters, than, microfiltration, which, allow, lactose, and, water, to, pass, through, while, retaining, fats, calcium, and, protein, as, with, microfiltration, the, fat, may, be, removed, before, filtration, and, added, back, in, afterwards, ultrafiltered, milk, is, used, in, cheesemaking, since, it, has, reduced, volume, for, a, given, protein, content, and, is, sold, directly, to, consumers, as, a, higher, protein, lower, sugar, content, and, creamier, alternative, to, regular, milk, upon, standing, for, 12, to, 24, hours, fresh, milk, has, a, tendency, to, separate, into, a, high, fat, cream, layer, on, top, of, a, larger, low, fat, milk, layer, the, cream, often, is, sold, as, a, separate, product, with, its, own, uses, today, the, separation, of, the, cream, from, the, milk, usually, is, accomplished, rapidly, in, centrifugal, cream, separators, the, fat, globules, rise, to, the, top, of, a, container, of, milk, because, fat, is, less, dense, than, water, the, smaller, the, globules, the, more, other, molecular, level, forces, prevent, this, from, happening, the, cream, rises, in, cow, s, milk, much, more, quickly, than, a, simple, model, would, predict, rather, than, isolated, globules, the, fat, in, the, milk, tends, to, form, into, clusters, containing, about, a, million, globules, held, together, by, a, number, of, minor, whey, proteins, these, clusters, rise, faster, than, individual, globules, can, the, fat, globules, in, milk, from, goats, sheep, and, water, buffalo, do, not, form, clusters, as, readily, and, are, smaller, to, begin, with, resulting, in, a, slower, separation, of, cream, from, these, milks, milk, often, is, homogenized, a, treatment, that, prevents, a, cream, layer, from, separating, out, of, the, milk, the, milk, is, pumped, at, high, pressures, through, very, narrow, tubes, breaking, up, the, fat, globules, through, turbulence, and, cavitation, a, greater, number, of, smaller, particles, possess, more, total, surface, area, than, a, smaller, number, of, larger, ones, and, the, original, fat, globule, membranes, cannot, completely, cover, them, casein, micelles, are, attracted, to, the, newly, exposed, fat, surfaces, nearly, one, third, of, the, micelles, in, the, milk, end, up, participating, in, this, new, membrane, structure, the, casein, weighs, down, the, globules, and, interferes, with, the, clustering, that, accelerated, separation, the, exposed, fat, globules, are, vulnerable, to, certain, enzymes, present, in, milk, which, could, break, down, the, fats, and, produce, rancid, flavors, to, prevent, this, the, enzymes, are, inactivated, by, pasteurizing, the, milk, immediately, before, or, during, homogenization, homogenized, milk, tastes, blander, but, feels, creamier, in, the, mouth, than, unhomogenized, it, is, whiter, and, more, resistant, to, developing, off, flavors, creamline, or, cream, top, milk, is, unhomogenized, it, may, or, may, not, have, been, pasteurized, milk, that, has, undergone, high, pressure, homogenization, sometimes, labeled, as, ultra, homogenized, has, a, longer, shelf, life, than, milk, that, has, undergone, ordinary, homogenization, at, lower, pressures, ultra, heat, treatment, uht, is, a, type, of, milk, processing, where, all, bacteria, are, destroyed, with, high, heat, to, extend, its, shelf, life, for, up, to, 6, months, as, long, as, the, package, is, not, opened, milk, is, firstly, homogenized, and, then, is, heated, to, 138, degrees, celsius, for, 2, 4, seconds, the, milk, is, immediately, cooled, down, and, packed, into, a, sterile, container, as, a, result, of, this, treatment, all, the, pathogenic, bacteria, within, the, milk, are, destroyed, unlike, when, the, milk, is, just, pasteurized, the, treated, milk, will, keep, for, up, to, 6, months, if, unopened, uht, milk, does, not, need, to, be, refrigerated, until, the, package, is, opened, which, makes, it, easier, to, ship, and, store, however, in, this, process, there, is, a, loss, of, vitamin, b1, and, vitamin, c, and, there, is, also, a, slight, change, in, the, taste, of, the, milk, the, composition, of, milk, differs, widely, among, species, factors, such, as, the, type, of, protein, the, proportion, of, protein, fat, and, sugar, the, levels, of, various, vitamins, and, minerals, and, the, size, of, the, butterfat, globules, and, the, strength, of, the, curd, are, among, those, that, may, vary, for, example, donkey, and, horse, milk, have, the, lowest, fat, content, while, the, milk, of, seals, and, whales, may, contain, more, than, 50, fat, these, compositions, vary, by, breed, animal, and, point, in, the, lactation, period, the, protein, range, for, these, four, breeds, is, 3, 3, to, 3, 9, while, the, lactose, range, is, 4, 7, to, 4, 9, milk, fat, percentages, may, be, manipulated, by, dairy, farmers, stock, diet, formulation, strategies, the, infection, known, as, mastitis, especially, in, dairy, cattle, can, cause, fat, levels, to, decline, processed, cow, s, milk, was, formulated, to, contain, differing, amounts, of, fat, during, the, 1950s, one, cup, 250, ml, of, 2, fat, cow, s, milk, contains, 285, mg, of, calcium, which, represents, 22, to, 29, of, the, daily, recommended, intake, dri, of, calcium, for, an, adult, depending, on, its, age, milk, contains, 8, grams, of, protein, and, a, number, of, other, nutrients, either, naturally, or, through, fortification, whole, milk, has, a, glycemic, index, of, 39, 3, a, food, is, considered, to, have, a, low, gi, if, it, is, 55, or, less, for, protein, quality, whole, milk, has, a, digestible, indispensable, amino, acid, score, diaas, of, 1, 43, with, the, limiting, amino, acid, for, those, groups, being, methionine, and, cysteine, a, diaas, of, 1, or, more, is, considered, to, be, an, excellent, high, protein, quality, source, there, is, mixed, evidence, that, drinking, milk, increases, the, risk, of, cancer, in, general, and, good, evidence, that, milk, drinking, may, have, a, protective, effect, specifically, against, bowel, cancer, one, of, the, most, common, food, allergies, in, infants, is, to, cow, s, milk, this, is, an, immunologically, mediated, adverse, reaction, rarely, fatal, to, one, or, more, cow, s, milk, proteins, milk, allergy, affects, between, 2, and, 3, of, babies, and, young, children, to, reduce, risk, recommendations, are, that, babies, should, be, exclusively, breastfed, for, at, least, four, months, preferably, six, months, before, introducing, cow, s, milk, the, majority, of, children, outgrow, milk, allergy, but, for, about, 0, 4, the, condition, persists, into, adulthood, lactose, intolerance, is, a, condition, in, which, people, have, symptoms, due, to, deficiency, or, absence, of, the, enzyme, lactase, in, the, small, intestine, causing, poor, absorption, of, milk, lactose, people, affected, vary, in, the, amount, of, lactose, they, can, tolerate, before, symptoms, develop, which, may, include, abdominal, pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and, nausea, severity, depends, on, the, amount, of, milk, consumed, those, affected, are, usually, able, to, drink, at, least, one, cup, of, milk, without, developing, significant, symptoms, with, greater, amounts, tolerated, if, drunk, with, a, meal, or, throughout, the, day, the, mammary, gland, is, thought, to, have, derived, from, apocrine, skin, glands, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, original, function, of, lactation, milk, production, was, keeping, eggs, moist, much, of, the, argument, is, based, on, monotremes, egg, laying, mammals, the, original, adaptive, significance, of, milk, secretions, may, have, been, nutrition, and, immunological, protection, tritylodontid, cynodonts, seem, to, have, displayed, lactation, based, on, their, dental, replacement, patterns, since, november, 1993, recombinant, bovine, somatotropin, rbst, also, called, rbgh, has, been, sold, to, dairy, farmers, with, fda, approval, cows, produce, bovine, growth, hormone, naturally, but, some, producers, administer, an, additional, recombinant, version, of, bgh, which, is, produced, through, genetically, engineered, e, coli, to, increase, milk, production, bovine, growth, hormone, also, stimulates, liver, production, of, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, igf1, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, the, national, institutes, of, health, and, the, world, health, organization, have, reported, that, both, of, these, compounds, are, safe, for, human, consumption, at, the, amounts, present, milk, from, cows, given, rbst, may, be, sold, in, the, united, states, and, the, fda, stated, that, no, significant, difference, has, been, shown, between, milk, derived, from, rbst, treated, and, that, from, non, rbst, treated, cows, milk, that, advertises, that, it, comes, from, cows, not, treated, with, rbst, is, required, to, state, this, finding, on, its, label, cows, receiving, rbgh, supplements, may, more, frequently, contract, an, udder, infection, known, as, mastitis, problems, with, mastitis, have, led, to, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, japan, banning, milk, from, rbst, treated, cows, mastitis, among, other, diseases, may, be, responsible, for, the, fact, that, levels, of, white, blood, cells, in, milk, vary, naturally, rbgh, is, also, banned, in, the, european, union, for, reasons, of, animal, welfare, milk, products, are, sold, in, a, number, of, varieties, based, on, types, degrees, of, milk, preserved, by, the, uht, process, does, not, need, to, be, refrigerated, before, opening, and, has, a, much, longer, shelf, life, six, months, than, milk, in, ordinary, packaging, it, is, typically, sold, unrefrigerated, in, the, uk, us, europe, latin, america, and, australia, lactose, free, milk, can, be, produced, by, passing, milk, over, lactase, enzyme, bound, to, an, inert, carrier, once, the, molecule, is, cleaved, there, are, no, lactose, ill, effects, forms, are, available, with, reduced, amounts, of, lactose, typically, 30, of, normal, and, alternatively, with, nearly, 0, the, only, noticeable, difference, from, regular, milk, is, a, slightly, sweeter, taste, due, to, the, cleavage, of, lactose, into, glucose, and, galactose, lactose, reduced, milk, can, also, be, produced, via, ultra, filtration, which, removes, smaller, molecules, such, as, lactose, and, water, while, leaving, calcium, and, proteins, behind, milk, produced, via, these, methods, has, a, lower, sugar, content, than, regular, milk, to, aid, digestion, in, those, with, lactose, intolerance, another, alternative, is, dairy, foods, milk, and, yogurt, with, added, bacterial, cultures, such, as, lactobacillus, acidophilus, acidophilus, milk, and, bifidobacteria, another, milk, with, lactococcus, lactis, bacteria, cultures, cultured, buttermilk, often, is, used, in, cooking, to, replace, the, traditional, use, of, naturally, soured, milk, which, has, become, rare, due, to, the, ubiquity, of, pasteurization, which, also, kills, the, naturally, occurring, lactococcus, bacteria, commercially, sold, milk, commonly, has, vitamin, d, added, to, it, to, make, up, for, lack, of, exposure, to, uvb, radiation, reduced, fat, milks, often, have, added, vitamin, a, palmitate, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, the, vitamin, during, fat, removal, in, the, united, states, this, results, in, reduced, fat, milks, having, a, higher, vitamin, a, content, than, whole, milk, milk, often, has, flavoring, added, to, it, for, better, taste, or, as, a, means, of, improving, sales, chocolate, milk, has, been, sold, for, many, years, and, has, been, followed, more, recently, by, strawberry, milk, and, others, some, nutritionists, have, criticized, flavored, milk, for, adding, sugar, usually, in, the, form, of, high, fructose, corn, syrup, to, the, diets, of, children, who, are, already, commonly, obese, in, the, us, due, to, the, short, shelf, life, of, normal, milk, it, used, to, be, delivered, to, households, daily, in, many, countries, however, improved, refrigeration, at, home, changing, food, shopping, patterns, because, of, supermarkets, and, the, higher, cost, of, home, delivery, mean, that, daily, deliveries, by, a, milkman, are, no, longer, available, in, most, countries, in, australia, and, new, zealand, prior, to, metrication, milk, was, generally, distributed, in, 1, pint, 568, ml, glass, bottles, in, australia, and, ireland, there, was, a, government, funded, free, milk, for, school, children, program, and, milk, was, distributed, at, morning, recess, in, 1, 3, pint, bottles, with, the, conversion, to, metric, measures, the, milk, industry, was, concerned, that, the, replacement, of, the, pint, bottles, with, 500, ml, bottles, would, result, in, a, 13, 6, drop, in, milk, consumption, hence, all, pint, bottles, were, recalled, and, replaced, by, 600, ml, bottles, with, time, due, to, the, steadily, increasing, cost, of, collecting, transporting, storing, and, cleaning, glass, bottles, they, were, replaced, by, cardboard, cartons, a, number, of, designs, were, used, including, a, tetrahedron, which, could, be, close, packed, without, waste, space, and, could, not, be, knocked, over, accidentally, slogan, no, more, crying, over, spilt, milk, however, the, industry, eventually, settled, on, a, design, similar, to, that, used, in, the, united, states, milk, is, now, available, in, a, variety, of, sizes, in, paperboard, milk, cartons, 250, ml, 375, ml, 600, ml, 1, liter, and, 1, 5, liters, and, plastic, bottles, 1, 2, and, 3, liters, a, significant, addition, to, the, marketplace, has, been, long, life, milk, uht, generally, available, in, 1, and, 2, liter, rectangular, cardboard, cartons, in, urban, and, suburban, areas, where, there, is, sufficient, demand, home, delivery, is, still, available, though, in, suburban, areas, this, is, often, three, times, per, week, rather, than, daily, another, significant, and, popular, addition, to, the, marketplace, has, been, flavored, milks, for, example, as, mentioned, above, farmers, union, iced, coffee, outsells, coca, cola, in, south, australia, in, rural, india, milk, is, home, delivered, daily, by, local, milkmen, carrying, bulk, quantities, in, a, metal, container, usually, on, a, bicycle, in, other, parts, of, metropolitan, india, milk, is, usually, bought, or, delivered, in, plastic, bags, or, cartons, via, shops, or, supermarkets, the, current, milk, chain, flow, in, india, is, from, milk, producer, to, milk, collection, agent, then, it, is, transported, to, a, milk, chilling, center, and, bulk, transported, to, the, processing, plant, then, to, the, sales, agent, and, finally, to, the, consumer, a, 2011, survey, by, the, food, safety, and, standards, authority, of, india, found, that, nearly, 70, of, samples, had, not, conformed, to, the, standards, set, for, milk, the, study, found, that, due, to, lack, of, hygiene, and, sanitation, in, milk, handling, and, packaging, detergents, used, during, cleaning, operations, were, not, washed, properly, and, found, their, way, into, the, milk, about, 8, of, samples, in, the, survey, were, found, to, have, detergents, which, are, hazardous, to, health, in, pakistan, milk, is, supplied, in, jugs, milk, has, been, a, staple, food, especially, among, the, pastoral, tribes, in, this, country, since, the, late, 1990s, milk, buying, patterns, have, changed, drastically, in, the, uk, the, classic, milkman, who, travels, his, local, milk, round, route, using, a, milk, float, often, battery, powered, during, the, early, hours, and, delivers, milk, in, 1, pint, glass, bottles, with, aluminum, foil, tops, directly, to, households, has, almost, disappeared, two, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, decline, of, uk, home, deliveries, by, milkmen, are, household, refrigerators, which, lessen, the, need, for, daily, milk, deliveries, and, private, car, usage, which, has, increased, supermarket, shopping, another, factor, is, that, it, is, cheaper, to, purchase, milk, from, a, supermarket, than, from, home, delivery, in, 1996, more, than, 2, 5, billion, liters, of, milk, were, still, being, delivered, by, milkmen, but, by, 2006, only, 637, million, liters, 13, of, milk, consumed, was, delivered, by, some, 9, 500, milkmen, by, 2010, the, estimated, number, of, milkmen, had, dropped, to, 6, 000, assuming, that, delivery, per, milkman, is, the, same, as, it, was, in, 2006, this, means, milkmen, deliveries, now, only, account, for, 6, 7, of, all, milk, consumed, by, uk, households, 6, 7, billion, liters, in, 2008, 2009, almost, 95, of, all, milk, in, the, uk, is, thus, sold, in, shops, today, most, of, it, in, plastic, bottles, of, various, sizes, but, some, also, in, milk, cartons, milk, is, hardly, ever, sold, in, glass, bottles, in, uk, shops, in, the, united, states, glass, milk, bottles, have, been, replaced, mostly, with, milk, cartons, and, plastic, jugs, gallons, of, milk, are, almost, always, sold, in, jugs, while, half, gallons, and, quarts, may, be, found, in, both, paper, cartons, and, plastic, jugs, and, smaller, sizes, are, almost, always, in, cartons, the, half, pint, 237, ml, 5, 12, imp, pt, milk, carton, is, the, traditional, unit, as, a, component, of, school, lunches, though, some, companies, have, replaced, that, unit, size, with, a, plastic, bottle, which, is, also, available, at, retail, in, 6, and, 12, pack, size, glass, milk, bottles, are, now, rare, most, people, purchase, milk, in, bags, plastic, bottles, or, plastic, coated, paper, cartons, ultraviolet, uv, light, from, fluorescent, lighting, can, alter, the, flavor, of, milk, so, many, companies, that, once, distributed, milk, in, transparent, or, highly, translucent, containers, are, now, using, thicker, materials, that, block, the, uv, light, milk, comes, in, a, variety, of, containers, with, local, variants, practically, everywhere, condensed, milk, and, evaporated, milk, are, distributed, in, metal, cans, 250, and, 125, ml, paper, containers, and, 100, and, 200, ml, squeeze, tubes, and, powdered, milk, skim, and, whole, is, distributed, in, boxes, or, bags, when, raw, milk, is, left, standing, for, a, while, it, turns, sour, this, is, the, result, of, fermentation, where, lactic, acid, bacteria, ferment, the, lactose, in, the, milk, into, lactic, acid, prolonged, fermentation, may, render, the, milk, unpleasant, to, consume, this, fermentation, process, is, exploited, by, the, introduction, of, bacterial, cultures, e, g, lactobacilli, sp, streptococcus, sp, leuconostoc, sp, etc, to, produce, a, variety, of, fermented, milk, products, the, reduced, ph, from, lactic, acid, accumulation, denatures, proteins, and, causes, the, milk, to, undergo, a, variety, of, different, transformations, in, appearance, and, texture, ranging, from, an, aggregate, to, smooth, consistency, some, of, these, products, include, sour, cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, kefir, and, kumis, see, dairy, product, for, more, information, pasteurization, of, cow, s, milk, initially, destroys, any, potential, pathogens, and, increases, the, shelf, life, but, eventually, results, in, spoilage, that, makes, it, unsuitable, for, consumption, this, causes, it, to, assume, an, unpleasant, odor, and, the, milk, is, deemed, non, consumable, due, to, unpleasant, taste, and, an, increased, risk, of, food, poisoning, in, raw, milk, the, presence, of, lactic, acid, producing, bacteria, under, suitable, conditions, ferments, the, lactose, present, to, lactic, acid, the, increasing, acidity, in, turn, prevents, the, growth, of, other, organisms, or, slows, their, growth, significantly, during, pasteurization, however, these, lactic, acid, bacteria,
