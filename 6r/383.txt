often, compete, in, long, distance, track, and, road, events, as, well, the, crick, run, in, england, in, 1838, was, the, first, recorded, instance, of, an, organised, cross, country, competition, the, sport, gained, popularity, in, british, then, american, schools, in, the, 19th, century, and, culminated, in, the, creation, of, the, first, international, cross, country, championships, in,

within, the, modern, pentathlon, competition, since, the, 1912, summer, olympics, one, variation, on, traditional, cross, country, is, mountain, running, which, incorporates, significant, uphill, and, downhill, sections, as, an, additional, challenge, to, the, course, fell, running, and, orienteering, are, other, competitive, sports, similar, to, cross, country, although, they, feature, an, element, of, navigation, which, is, absent, from, the, set, courses, of, cross, country, racewalking, is, a, form, of, competitive, walking, that, usually, takes, place, on, open, air, roads,

a, foot, in, contact, with, the, ground, and, their, advancing, leg, must, be, straightened, not, bent, at, the, knee, failure, to, follow, these, rules, results, in, disqualification, from, the, race, racewalking, finds, its, roots, in, the, sport, of, pedestrianism, which, emerged, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, england, spectators, would, gamble, on, the, outcome, of, the, walking, competitions, the, sport, took, on, an, endurance, aspect, and, competitions, were, held, over, long, distances, or, walkers, would, have, to, achieve, a, certain, distance, within, a, specified, time, frame, such, as, centurion, contests, of, walking, 100, miles, 160, km, within, 24, hours, during, this, period, racewalking, was, frequently, held, on, athletics, tracks, for, ease, of, measurement, and, the, 1908, summer, olympics, in, london, saw, the, introduction, of, the, 3500, metre, and, 10, mile, walks, racewalking, was, briefly, dropped, from, the, olympic, programme, in, 1928, but, the, men, s, 50, kilometres, race, walk, has, been, held, at, every, olympic, games, but, one, since, 1932, the, men, s, 20, kilometres, race, walk, was, added, to, the, olympic, athletics, schedule, in, 1956, and, the, women, s, event, was, first, held, in, 1992, the, most, common, events, in, modern, competition, are, over, 10, km, 20, km, and, 50, km, on, roads, although, women, s, 3, km, and, men, s, 5, km, are, held, on, indoor, tracks, the, highest, level, racewalking, competitions, occur, at, the, iaaf, world, championships, in, athletics, and, at, the, summer, olympics, although, the, sport, also, has, its, own, separate, major, competition, the, iaaf, world, race, walking, cup, which, has, been, held, since, 1961, the, iaaf, world, race, walking, challenge, forms, the, primary, seasonal, competition, athletes, earn, points, for, their, performances, at, ten, selected, racewalking, competitions, and, the, highest, scoring, walkers, are, entered, into, that, year, s, iaaf, race, walking, challenge, final, the, significant, variation, in, people, s, abilities, in, the, sport, of, athletics, has, led, to, the, creation, of, numerous, competitive, categories, in, order, that, athletes, are, pitted, against, rivals, of, a, similar, kind, or, ability, and, to, include, groups, of, people, who, would, otherwise, not, be, competitive, in, open, to, all, events, the, eligibility, of, athletes, for, a, given, category, is, occasionally, a, source, of, controversy, among, the, sport, s, participants, officials, and, spectators, with, disputes, typically, being, rooted, in, deliberate, cheating, in, order, to, gain, a, competitive, advantage, or, differing, cultural, perspectives, over, the, eligibility, of, a, category, beyond, the, primary, categories, based, on, physical, attributes, some, competitions, have, further, eligibility, criteria, based, on, nationality, community, membership, or, occupation, the, foremost, division, of, this, kind, is, by, sex, in, athletics, men, and, women, almost, exclusively, compete, against, people, of, the, same, sex, in, contrast, to, the, men, s, division, the, development, of, the, women, s, division, has, caused, regular, dispute, in, terms, of, eligibility, several, intersex, athletes, had, success, in, the, women, s, division, in, the, early, 20th, century, such, as, stanis, awa, walasiewicz, and, mary, weston, later, mark, and, the, iaaf, responded, by, introducing, sex, verification, for, all, athletes, in, the, women, s, category, beginning, with, the, disqualification, of, sprinter, foekje, dillema, in, 1950, after, she, refused, to, be, tested, olympic, champion, ewa, k, obukowska, became, the, first, athlete, to, publicly, fail, the, test, in, 1967, and, the, humiliation, she, suffered, as, a, result, of, the, announcement, led, to, sex, tests, becoming, a, confidential, process, hurdler, maria, jos, mart, nez, pati, o, failed, a, test, and, was, disqualified, in, 1985, but, publicly, fought, the, ban, in, court, and, was, reinstated, in, 1988, in, 1991, the, iaaf, replaced, the, sex, chromatin, test, with, general, medical, tests, for, athletes, of, all, divisions, due, to, changes, in, ethical, and, scientific, viewpoints, the, question, of, eligibility, for, the, women, s, division, continued, to, be, a, contentious, and, public, issue, into, the, 21st, century, with, caster, semenya, and, dutee, chand, bearing, periods, of, ineligibility, and, taking, the, iaaf, to, the, court, of, arbitration, for, sport, over, their, bans, under, the, hyperandrogenism, rules, an, increasing, number, of, trans, men, and, trans, women, began, to, compete, in, the, women, s, division, in, the, 2010s, which, caused, other, athletes, in, the, division, to, raise, questions, of, fairness, in, competition, the, dispute, reached, new, heights, in, 2019, with, the, united, nations, human, rights, council, issuing, a, statement, that, the, iaaf, was, breaching, international, human, rights, norms, and, standards, through, its, practice, of, allowing, some, athletes, to, compete, in, the, women, s, division, only, once, they, had, lowered, their, testosterone, levels, through, medical, intervention, the, iaaf, and, several, prominent, women, athletes, such, as, paula, radcliffe, said, this, was, required, in, order, to, prevent, a, situation, where, countries, deliberately, sought, out, athletes, who, were, intersex, transgender, or, had, a, difference, in, sex, development, in, order, to, succeed, in, women, s, sport, others, have, argued, for, the, abolition, of, gender, verification, testing, with, academic, maren, behrensen, citing, the, harm, to, tested, athletes, social, and, emotional, well, being, the, inaccuracy, of, the, medical, tests, the, difficulty, of, determining, the, exact, performance, advantage, provided, by, a, given, condition, and, the, moral, risk, of, gender, engineering, by, setting, a, biological, definition, for, a, female, athlete, age, is, a, significant, determiner, of, ability, to, compete, in, athletics, with, athletic, ability, generally, increasing, through, childhood, and, adolescence, peaking, in, early, adulthood, then, gradually, declining, from, around, the, age, of, 30, onwards, as, a, result, numerous, age, categories, have, been, created, to, encourage, younger, and, older, athletes, to, engage, in, competition, at, international, level, there, are, three, major, categories, for, young, athletes, under, 23, under, 20, formerly, junior, and, under, 18, formerly, youth, beyond, international, rules, different, youth, categories, are, in, use, in, the, sport, often, in, the, form, of, two, year, or, single, age, groupings, age, categories, are, more, extensive, for, older, athletes, and, these, are, commonly, organised, under, the, umbrella, of, masters, athletics, which, has, age, groups, spanning, five, years, for, all, athletes, aged, 35, and, above, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, age, groupings, hence, stanis, aw, kowalski, holds, a, world, record, for, men, aged, 105, years, and, over, for, competitions, where, age, is, not, taken, into, account, this, is, known, as, senior, or, open, class, athletics, in, international, rules, there, remain, some, restrictions, on, younger, people, competing, in, endurance, events, for, health, reasons, athletes, eligibility, for, a, competitive, age, grouping, is, typically, assessed, through, official, documentation, such, as, birth, records, or, passports, instances, of, age, cheating, have, occurred, at, all, of, the, iaaf, s, global, age, category, championships, one, prominent, incident, was, olympic, medalist, thomas, longosiwa, who, provided, a, falsified, passport, to, compete, at, the, 2006, world, junior, championships, in, athletics, at, age, 24, age, falsification, for, youth, categories, is, mostly, limited, to, less, developed, parts, of, the, world, such, as, africa, and, south, asia, which, have, less, stringent, controls, on, official, documentation, and, many, mature, athletes, engaging, in, high, school, competition, due, to, disruptions, to, education, the, same, regions, of, the, world, also, present, issues, with, age, verification, in, masters, age, categories, with, examples, such, as, indian, distance, runners, dharampal, singh, gudha, and, fauja, singh, both, claiming, to, be, over, 100, years, old, reaching, mainstream, attention, athletes, with, physical, disabilities, have, competed, at, separate, international, events, since, 1952, the, international, paralympic, committee, governs, the, competitions, in, athletics, and, hosts, the, paralympic, games, which, have, continued, since, 1960, competitors, at, elite, level, competitions, are, classified, by, disability, to, arrange, athletes, with, a, similar, disability, in, the, same, event, a, classified, t12, athlete, for, example, is, a, track, athlete, with, a, visual, impairment, operating, independently, of, the, paralympic, movement, deaf, athletes, have, a, long, established, tradition, of, organised, athletics, with, the, first, major, world, competition, being, included, at, the, 1924, deaflympics, the, primary, impediments, to, the, inclusion, of, deaf, athletes, in, mainstream, athletics, are, sound, based, elements, of, the, sport, such, as, the, starter, s, pistol, this, can, be, a, disadvantage, even, in, paralympic, sport, as, shown, in, by, the, example, of, olivia, breen, who, failed, to, hear, a, false, start, in, a, cerebral, palsy, class, race, at, the, 2012, paralympics, in, wheelchair, racing, athletes, compete, in, lightweight, racing, chairs, most, major, marathons, have, wheelchair, divisions, and, the, elite, racers, consistently, beat, the, runners, on, foot, the, speed, of, wheel, chair, racers, has, caused, difficulties, for, race, organisers, in, properly, staggering, their, start, times, compared, to, runners, a, collision, between, josh, cassidy, a, wheelchair, racer, and, tiki, gelana, a, leading, female, marathoner, at, the, 2013, london, marathon, brought, the, issue, into, the, spotlight, again, occasionally, athletes, with, a, disability, reach, a, level, at, which, they, can, compete, against, able, bodied, athletes, legally, blind, marla, runyan, ran, in, the, 2000, and, 2004, olympics, and, won, a, gold, medal, in, the, 1500, metres, at, the, 1999, pan, american, games, oscar, pistorius, a, double, amputee, was, a, semi, finalist, at, the, 2011, world, championships, and, won, a, silver, medal, as, part, of, south, africa, s, 4, 400, metres, relay, team, in, masters, athletics, it, is, far, more, common, to, make, an, accommodation, for, athletes, with, a, disability, blind, ivy, granstrom, set, numerous, masters, world, records, while, being, guided, around, the, track, the, disability, categories, have, caused, dispute, among, athletes, with, some, athletes, being, accused, of, exaggerating, their, level, of, disability, in, order, to, compete, in, less, challenging, categories, athletes, with, intellectual, disabilities, were, banned, from, competition, in, all, paralympic, sports, in, response, to, verification, issues, and, cheating, at, the, 2000, summer, paralympics, and, the, intellectual, disability, athletics, programme, was, only, restored, twelve, years, later, at, the, 2012, summer, paralympics, professional, athletics, almost, exclusively, takes, place, in, one, of, three, types, of, venue, stadiums, set, courses, on, grass, or, woodland, and, road, based, courses, such, venues, ensure, that, events, take, place, in, a, relatively, standardised, manner, as, well, as, improving, the, safety, of, athletes, and, enjoyment, for, spectators, at, a, more, basic, level, many, forms, of, athletics, demand, very, little, in, terms, of, venue, requirements, almost, any, open, space, or, area, of, field, can, provide, a, suitable, venue, for, basic, running, jumping, and, throwing, competitions, a, standard, outdoor, track, is, in, the, shape, of, a, stadium, 400, metres, in, length, and, has, at, least, eight, lanes, 1, 22, m, in, width, small, arenas, might, have, six, lanes, older, track, facilities, may, have, nonstandard, track, lengths, such, as, 440, yards, 402, 3, m, 1, 4, mile, common, in, the, united, states, historically, tracks, were, covered, by, a, dirt, running, surface, modern, all, weather, running, tracks, are, covered, by, a, synthetic, weather, resistant, running, surface, which, typically, consists, of, rubber, either, black, sbr, or, colored, epdm, granules, bound, by, polyurethane, or, latex, resins, older, tracks, may, be, cinder, covered, the, facilities, can, be, called, track, and, field, stadiums, or, athletics, stadiums, a, standard, indoor, track, is, designed, similarly, to, an, outdoor, track, but, is, only, 200, metres, in, length, and, has, between, four, and, eight, lanes, each, with, width, between, 0, 90, m, and, 1, 10, m, often, the, bends, of, an, indoor, track, will, be, banked, to, compensate, for, the, small, turning, radius, however, because, of, space, limitations, indoor, tracks, may, have, other, nonstandard, lengths, such, as, 160, yard, 146, 3, m, indoor, track, at, madison, square, garden, used, for, the, millrose, games, because, of, space, limitations, meetings, held, at, indoor, facilities, do, not, hold, many, of, athletics, events, typically, contested, outdoors, there, is, no, standardised, form, of, cross, country, course, and, each, venue, is, significantly, defined, by, the, environment, it, contains, some, may, be, relatively, flat, and, featureless, while, others, may, be, more, challenging, with, natural, obstacles, tight, turns, and, undulating, ground, while, a, small, number, of, purpose, built, courses, exist, the, vast, majority, of, cross, country, running, courses, are, created, by, cordoning, a, specific, area, within, any, open, natural, land, typically, a, park, woodland, or, greenspace, near, a, settlement, at, the, elite, and, professional, level, courses, must, be, looped, and, each, lap, must, be, between, 1750, m, and, 2000, m, in, length, severe, obstacles, such, as, deep, ditches, high, barriers, and, thick, undergrowth, not, normally, present, the, course, should, be, able, to, be, completed, whilst, remaining, on, foot, throughout, in, order, to, maintain, the, sport, s, distinction, from, road, running, the, usage, of, unnatural, or, macadamised, surfaces, is, generally, kept, to, a, minimum, or, avoided, entirely, because, the, majority, of, races, take, place, on, areas, of, grass, soil, mud, or, earth, weather, conditions, can, significantly, affect, the, difficulty, of, cross, country, courses, as, snow, and, rain, reduces, traction, and, can, create, areas, of, standing, water, the, surface, of, road, races, is, highly, important, and, the, iaaf, dictate, that, the, courses, must, be, along, man, made, roads, bicycle, paths, or, footpaths, courses, set, along, major, roads, of, cities, are, typical, of, road, running, events, and, traffic, is, usually, cordoned, off, from, the, area, during, the, competition, while, soft, ground, such, as, grass, is, generally, avoided, races, may, start, and, finish, on, soft, ground, or, within, an, athletics, stadium, road, racing, courses, come, in, two, primary, types, looped, and, point, to, point, courses, may, be, measured, and, designed, to, cover, a, standardised, distance, such, as, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, or, they, may, simply, follow, a, set, route, between, two, landmarks, road, running, courses, over, 5, km, usually, offer, drinks, or, refreshment, stations, for, runners, at, designated, points, alongside, the, course, and, medical, professionals, are, present, at, the, courses, of, major, races, due, to, the, health, risks, involved, with, long, distance, running, elite, road, walks, are, conducted, on, closed, loop, courses, usually, loops, of, 2, 000, or, 2, 500, meters, refreshment, stations, are, also, present, over, long, distance, walking, competitions, with, drinks, being, available, on, every, lap, for, races, longer, than, 10, km, in, 1912, the, formation, of, the, international, governing,
