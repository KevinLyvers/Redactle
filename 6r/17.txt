face, derived, in, turn, from, italian, maschera, from, medieval, latin, masca, mask, specter, nightmare, this, word, is, of, uncertain, origin, perhaps, from, arabic, maskharah, buffoon, from, the, verb, sakhira, to, ridicule, however, it, may, also, come, from, proven, al, mascarar, to, black, the, face, or, the, related, catalan, mascarar, old, french, mascurer, this, in, turn, is, of, uncertain, origin, perhaps, from, a, germanic, source, akin, to, english, mesh, but, perhaps, from, mask, black, a, borrowing, from, a, pre, indo, european, language, one, german, author, claims, the,

the, religious, use, of, masks, has, waned, masks, are, used, sometimes, in, drama, therapy, or, psychotherapy, one, of, the, challenges, in, anthropology, is, finding, the, precise, derivation, of, human, culture, and, early, activities, the, invention, and, use, of, the, mask, is, only, one, area, of, unsolved, inquiry, the, use, of, masks, dates, back, several, millennia, it, is, conjectured, that, the, first, masks, may, have, been, used, by, primitive, people, to, associate, the, wearer, with, some, kind, of, unimpeachable, authority, such, as, a, deity, or, to, otherwise, lend, credence, to, the, person, s, claim, on, a, given, social, role, the, earliest, known, anthropomorphic, artwork, is, circa, 30, 000, 40, 000, years, old, the, use, of, masks, is, demonstrated, graphically, at, some, of, these, sites, insofar, as, masks, involved, the, use, of, war, paint, leather, vegetative, material, or, wooden, material, such, masks, failed, to, be, preserved, however, they, are, visible, in, paleolithic, cave, drawings, of, which, dozens, have, been, preserved, at, the, neanderthal, roche, cotard, site, in, france, a, flintstone, likeness, of, a, face, was, found, that, is, approximately, 35, 000, years, old, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, it, was, intended, as, a, mask, in, the, greek, bacchanalia, and, the, dionysus, cult, which, involved, the, use, of, masks, the, ordinary, controls, on, behaviour, were, temporarily, suspended, and, people, cavorted, in, merry, revelry, outside, their, ordinary, rank, or, status, ren, gu, non, claims, that, in, the,

soldiers, masks, in, various, forms, sacred, practical, or, playful, have, played, a, crucial, historical, role, in, the, development, of, understandings, about, what, it, means, to, be, human, because, they, permit, the, imaginative, experience, of, what, it, is, like, to, be, transformed, into, a, different, identity, or, to, affirm, an, existing, social, or, spiritual, identity, not, all, cultures, have, known, the, use, of, masks, but, most, of, them, have, throughout, the, world, masks, are, used, for, their, expressive, power, as, a, feature, of, masked, performance, both, ritually, and, in, various, theatre, traditions, the, ritual, and, theatrical, definitions, of, mask, use, frequently, overlap, and, merge, but, still, provide, a, useful, basis, for, categorisation, the, image, of, juxtaposed, comedy, and, tragedy, masks, are, widely, used, to, represent, the, performing, arts, and, specifically, drama, in, many, dramatic, traditions, including, the, theatre, of,

or, are, typically, worn, by, all, the, performers, with, several, different, types, of, mask, used, for, different, types, of, character, in, ancient, rome, the, word, persona, meant, a, mask, it, also, referred, to, an, individual, who, had, full, roman, citizenship, a, citizen, could, demonstrate, his, or, her, lineage, through, imagines, death, masks, of, ancestors, these, were, wax, casts, kept, in, a, lararium, the, family, shrine, rites, of, passage, such, as, initiation, of, young, members, of, the, family, or, funerals, were, carried, out, at, the, shrine, under, the, watch, of, the, ancestral, masks, at, funerals, professional, actors, would, wear, these, masks, to, perform, deeds, of, the, lives, of, the, ancestors, thus, linking, the, role, of, mask, as, a, ritual, object, and, in, theatre, masks, are, a, familiar, and, vivid, element, in, many, folk, and, traditional, pageants, ceremonies, rituals, and, festivals, and, are, often, of, an, ancient, origin, the, mask, is, normally, a, part, of, a, costume, that, adorns, the, whole, body, and, embodies, a, tradition, important, to, the, religious, and, or, social, life, of, the, community, as, whole, or, a, particular, group, within, the, community, masks, are, used, almost, universally, and, maintain, their, power, and, mystery, both, for, their, wearers, and, their, audience, the, continued, popularity, of, wearing, masks, at, carnival, and, for, children, at, parties, and, for, festivals, such, as, halloween, are, good, examples, nowadays, these, are, usually, mass, produced, plastic, masks, often, associated, with, popular, films, television, programmes, or, cartoon, characters, they, are, however, reminders, of, the, enduring, power, of, pretense, and, play, and, the, power, and, appeal, of, masks, ritual, masks, occur, throughout, the, world, and, although, they, tend, to, share, many, characteristics, highly, distinctive, forms, have, developed, the, function, of, the,

that, ritual, masks, as, representations, of, the, human, face, are, extremely, revealing, of, the, two, fundamental, aspects, of, the, human, psychological, condition, firstly, the, repression, of, a, cooperative, instinctive, self, or, soul, and, secondly, the, extremely, angry, state, of, the, unjustly, condemned, conscious, thinking, egocentric, intellect, in, parts, of, australia, giant,

tradition, of, european, masks, developed, more, self, consciously, from, court, and, civic, events, or, entertainments, managed, by, guilds, and, co, fraternities, these, grew, out, of, the, earlier, revels, and, had, become, evident, by, the, 15th, century, in, places, such, as, rome, and, venice, where, they, developed, as, entertainments, to, enliven, towns, and, cities, thus, the, maundy, thursday, carnival, in, st, marks, square, in, venice, attended, by, the, doge, and, aristocracy, also, involved, the, guilds, including, a, guild, of, maskmakers, there, is, evidence, of, commedia, dell, arte, inspired, venetian, masks, and, by, the, late, 16th, century, the, venetian, carnival, began, to, reach, its, peak, and, eventually, lasted, a, whole, season, from, january, until, lent,

during, the, reformation, many, of, these, carnival, customs, began, to, die, out, in, protestant, regions, although, they, seem, to, have, survived, in, catholic, areas, despite, the, opposition, of, the, ecclesiastical, authorities, so, by, the, 19th, century, the, carnivals, of, the, relatively, wealthy, bourgeois, town, communities, with, elaborate, masques, and, costumes, existed, side, by, side, with, the, ragged, and, essentially, folkloric, customs, of, the, rural, areas, although, these, civic, masquerades, and, their, masks, may, have, retained, elements, drawn, from, popular, culture, the, survival, of, carnival, in, the, 19th, century, was, often, a, consequence, of, a, self, conscious, folklore, movement, that, accompanied, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, many, european, countries, nowadays, during, carnival, in, the, netherlands, masks, are, often, replaced, with, face, paint, for, more, comfort, in, the, beginning, of, the, new, century, on, 19, august, 2004, the,

visually, led, one, lecoq, s, pedagogy, has, been, hugely, influential, for, theatre, practitioners, in, europe, working, with, mask, and, has, been, exported, widely, across, the, world, this, work,
