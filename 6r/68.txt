shapes, then, cooked, by, boiling, or, baking, pasta, was, traditionally, only, made, with, durum, although, the, definition, has, been, expanded, to, include, alternatives, for, a, gluten, free, diet, such, as, rice, flour, or, legumes, such, as, beans, or, lentils, while, asian, noodles, originated, in, china, pasta, is, believed, to, have, developed, independently, in, italy, and, is, a, staple, food, of, italian, cuisine, with, evidence, of, etruscans, making, pasta, as, early, as, 400, bce, in, italy, pastas, are, divided, into, two, broad, categories, dried, italian, pasta, secca, and, fresh, italian, pasta, fresca, most, dried, pasta, is, produced, commercially, via, an, extrusion, process, although, it, can, be, produced, at, home, fresh, pasta, is, traditionally, produced, by, hand, sometimes, with, the, aid, of, simple, machines, fresh, pastas, available, in, grocery, stores, are, produced, commercially, by, large, scale, machines, both, dried, and, fresh, pastas, come, in, a, number, of, shapes, and, varieties, with, 310, specific, forms, known, by, over, 1, 300, documented, names, in, italy, the, names, of, specific, pasta, shapes, or, types, often, vary, by, locale, for, example, the, pasta, form, cavatelli, is, known, by, 28, different, names, depending, upon, the, town, and, region, common, forms, of, pasta, include, long, and, short, shapes, tubes, flat, shapes, or, sheets, miniature, shapes, for, soup, those, meant, to, be, filled, or, stuffed, and, specialty, or, decorative, shapes, as, a, category, in, italian, cuisine, both, fresh, and, dried, pastas, are, classically, used, in, one, of, three, kinds, of, prepared, dishes, as, pasta, asciutta, or, pastasciutta, cooked, pasta, is, plated, and, served, with, a, complementary, sauce, or, condiment, a, second, classification, of, pasta, dishes, is, pasta, in, brodo, in, which, the, pasta, is, part, of, a, soup, type, dish, a, third, category, is, pasta, al, forno, in, which, the, pasta, is, incorporated, into, a, dish, that, is, subsequently, baked, in, the, oven, pasta, dishes, are, generally, simple, but, individual, dishes, vary, in, preparation, some, pasta, dishes, are, served, as, a, small, first, course, or, for, light, lunches, such, as, pasta, salads, other, dishes, may, be, portioned, larger, and, used, for, dinner, pasta, sauces, similarly, may, vary, in, taste, color, and, texture, in, terms, of, nutrition, cooked, plain, pasta, is, 31, carbohydrates, mostly, starch, 6, protein, and, low, in, fat, with, moderate, amounts, of, manganese, but, pasta, generally, has, low, micronutrient, content, pasta, may, be, enriched, or, fortified, or, made, from, whole, grains, earliest, appearances, in, the, english, language, are, in, the, 1830s, the, word, pasta, comes, from, italian, pasta, in, turn, from, latin, pasta, latinisation, of, the, greek, pasta, evidence, of, etruscans, making, pasta, dates, back, to, 400, bce, the, first, concrete, information, on, pasta, products, in, italy, dates, to, the, 13th, or, 14th, centuries, in, the, 1st, century, ad, writings, of, horace, lagana, sg, laganum, were, fine, sheets, of, fried, dough, and, were, an, everyday, foodstuff, writing, in, the, 2nd, century, athenaeus, of, naucratis, provides, a, recipe, for, lagana, which, he, attributes, to, the, 1st, century, chrysippus, of, tyana, sheets, of, dough, made, of, wheat, flour, and, the, juice, of, crushed, lettuce, then, flavored, with, spices, and, deep, fried, in, oil, an, early, 5th, century, cookbook, describes, a, dish, called, lagana, that, consisted, of, layers, of, dough, with, meat, stuffing, an, ancestor, of, modern, day, lasagna, however, the, method, of, cooking, these, sheets, of, dough, does, not, correspond, to, the, modern, definition, of, either, a, fresh, or, dry, pasta, product, which, only, had, similar, basic, ingredients, and, perhaps, the, shape, historians, have, noted, several, lexical, milestones, relevant, to, pasta, none, of, which, changes, these, basic, characteristics, for, example, the, works, of, the, 2nd, century, ad, greek, physician, galen, mention, itrion, homogeneous, compounds, made, of, flour, and, water, the, jerusalem, talmud, records, that, itrium, a, kind, of, boiled, dough, was, common, in, palestine, from, the, 3rd, to, 5th, centuries, ad, a, dictionary, compiled, by, the, 9th, century, arab, physician, and, lexicographer, isho, bar, ali, defines, itriyya, the, arabic, cognate, as, string, like, shapes, made, of, semolina, and, dried, before, cooking, the, geographical, text, of, muhammad, al, idrisi, compiled, for, the, norman, king, of, sicily, roger, ii, in, 1154, mentions, itriyya, manufactured, and, exported, from, norman, sicily, west, of, termini, there, is, a, delightful, settlement, called, trabia, its, ever, flowing, streams, propel, a, number, of, mills, here, there, are, huge, buildings, in, the, countryside, where, they, make, vast, quantities, of, itriyya, which, is, exported, everywhere, to, calabria, to, muslim, and, christian, countries, very, many, shiploads, are, sent, one, form, of, itriyya, with, a, long, history, is, lagana, which, in, latin, refers, to, thin, sheets, of, dough, and, gave, rise, to, the, italian, lasagna, in, north, africa, a, food, similar, to, pasta, known, as, couscous, has, been, eaten, for, centuries, however, it, lacks, the, distinguishing, malleable, nature, of, pasta, couscous, being, more, akin, to, droplets, of, dough, at, first, dry, pasta, was, a, luxury, item, in, italy, because, of, high, labor, costs, durum, wheat, semolina, had, to, be, kneaded, for, a, long, time, there, is, a, legend, of, marco, polo, importing, pasta, from, china, which, originated, with, the, macaroni, journal, published, by, an, association, of, food, industries, with, the, goal, of, promoting, pasta, in, the, united, states, rustichello, da, pisa, writes, in, his, travels, that, marco, polo, described, a, food, similar, to, lagana, the, way, pasta, reached, europe, is, unknown, however, there, are, many, theories, jeffrey, steingarten, asserts, that, moors, introduced, pasta, in, the, emirate, of, sicily, in, the, ninth, century, mentioning, also, that, traces, of, pasta, have, been, found, in, ancient, greece, and, that, jane, grigson, believed, the, marco, polo, story, to, have, originated, in, the, 1920s, or, 1930s, in, an, advertisement, for, a, canadian, spaghetti, company, food, historians, estimate, that, the, dish, probably, took, hold, in, italy, as, a, result, of, extensive, mediterranean, trading, in, the, middle, ages, from, the, 13th, century, references, to, pasta, dishes, macaroni, ravioli, gnocchi, vermicelli, crop, up, with, increasing, frequency, across, the, italian, peninsula, in, the, 14th, century, writer, boccaccio, s, collection, of, earthy, tales, the, decameron, he, recounts, a, mouthwatering, fantasy, concerning, a, mountain, of, parmesan, cheese, down, which, pasta, chefs, roll, macaroni, and, ravioli, to, gluttons, waiting, below, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, dried, pasta, became, popular, for, its, easy, storage, this, allowed, people, to, store, pasta, on, ships, when, exploring, the, new, world, a, century, later, pasta, was, present, around, the, globe, during, the, voyages, of, discovery, although, tomatoes, were, introduced, to, italy, in, the, 16th, century, and, incorporated, in, italian, cuisine, in, the, 17th, century, description, of, the, first, italian, tomato, sauces, dates, from, the, late, 18th, century, the, first, written, record, of, pasta, with, tomato, sauce, can, be, found, in, the, 1790, cookbook, l, apicio, moderno, by, roman, chef, francesco, leonardi, before, tomato, sauce, was, introduced, pasta, was, eaten, dry, with, the, fingers, the, liquid, sauce, demanded, the, use, of, a, fork, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, naples, had, rudimentary, machines, for, producing, pasta, later, establishing, the, kneading, machine, and, press, making, pasta, manufacturing, cost, effective, in, 1740, a, license, for, the, first, pasta, factory, was, issued, in, venice, during, the, 1800s, watermills, and, stone, grinders, were, used, to, separate, semolina, from, the, bran, initiating, expansion, of, the, pasta, market, in, 1859, joseph, topits, 1824, 1876, founded, hungary, s, first, pasta, factory, in, the, city, of, pest, which, worked, with, steam, machines, it, was, one, of, the, first, pasta, factories, in, central, europe, by, 1867, buitoni, company, in, sansepolcro, tuscany, was, an, established, pasta, manufacturer, during, the, early, 1900s, artificial, drying, and, extrusion, processes, enabled, greater, variety, of, pasta, preparation, and, larger, volumes, for, export, beginning, a, period, called, the, industry, of, pasta, in, 1884, the, z, tka, brothers, s, plant, in, bor, ov, nad, vltavou, was, founded, making, it, bohemia, s, first, pasta, factory, the, art, of, pasta, making, and, the, devotion, to, the, food, as, a, whole, has, evolved, since, pasta, was, first, conceptualized, in, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, italians, ate, over, 27, kg, 60, lb, of, pasta, per, person, per, year, easily, beating, americans, who, ate, about, 9, kg, 20, lb, per, person, pasta, is, so, beloved, in, italy, that, individual, consumption, exceeds, the, average, production, of, wheat, of, the, country, thus, italy, frequently, imports, wheat, for, pasta, making, in, contemporary, society, pasta, is, ubiquitous, and, there, is, a, variety, of, types, in, local, supermarkets, in, many, countries, with, the, worldwide, demand, for, this, staple, food, pasta, is, now, largely, mass, produced, in, factories, and, only, a, tiny, proportion, is, crafted, by, hand, since, at, least, the, time, of, cato, s, de, agri, cultura, basic, pasta, dough, has, been, made, mostly, of, wheat, flour, or, semolina, with, durum, wheat, used, predominantly, in, the, south, of, italy, and, soft, wheat, in, the, north, regionally, other, grains, have, been, used, including, those, from, barley, buckwheat, rye, rice, and, maize, as, well, as, chestnut, and, chickpea, flours, liquid, often, in, the, form, of, eggs, is, used, to, turn, the, flour, into, a, dough, to, address, the, needs, of, people, affected, by, gluten, related, disorders, such, as, coeliac, disease, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, and, wheat, allergy, sufferers, some, recipes, use, rice, or, maize, for, making, pasta, grain, flours, may, also, be, supplemented, with, cooked, potatoes, other, additions, to, the, basic, flour, liquid, mixture, may, include, vegetable, purees, such, as, spinach, or, tomato, mushrooms, cheeses, herbs, spices, and, other, seasonings, while, pastas, are, most, typically, made, from, unleavened, doughs, the, use, of, yeast, raised, doughs, are, also, known, for, at, least, nine, different, pasta, forms, additives, in, dried, commercially, sold, pasta, include, vitamins, and, minerals, that, are, lost, from, the, durum, wheat, endosperm, during, milling, they, are, added, back, to, the, semolina, flour, once, it, is, ground, creating, enriched, flour, micronutrients, added, may, include, niacin, vitamin, b3, riboflavin, vitamin, b2, folate, thiamine, vitamin, b1, and, ferrous, iron, fresh, pasta, is, usually, locally, made, with, fresh, ingredients, unless, it, is, destined, to, be, shipped, in, which, case, consideration, is, given, to, the, spoilage, rates, of, the, desired, ingredients, such, as, eggs, or, herbs, furthermore, fresh, pasta, is, usually, made, with, a, mixture, of, eggs, and, all, purpose, flour, or, 00, low, gluten, flour, since, it, contains, eggs, it, is, more, tender, compared, to, dried, pasta, and, only, takes, about, half, the, time, to, cook, delicate, sauces, are, preferred, for, fresh, pasta, in, order, to, let, the, pasta, take, front, stage, fresh, pastas, do, not, expand, in, size, after, cooking, therefore, 0, 7, kg, 1, 5, lb, of, pasta, are, needed, to, serve, four, people, generously, fresh, egg, pasta, is, generally, cut, into, strands, of, various, widths, and, thicknesses, depending, on, which, pasta, is, to, be, made, e, g, fettuccine, pappardelle, and, lasagne, it, is, best, served, with, meat, cheese, or, vegetables, to, create, filled, pastas, such, as, ravioli, tortellini, and, cannelloni, fresh, egg, pasta, is, well, known, in, the, piedmont, and, emilia, romagna, regions, of, northern, italy, in, this, area, dough, is, only, made, out, of, egg, yolk, and, flour, resulting, in, a, very, refined, flavor, and, texture, this, pasta, is, often, served, simply, with, butter, sauce, and, thinly, sliced, truffles, that, are, native, to, this, region, in, other, areas, such, as, apulia, fresh, pasta, can, be, made, without, eggs, the, only, ingredients, needed, to, make, the, pasta, dough, are, semolina, flour, and, water, which, is, often, shaped, into, orecchiette, or, cavatelli, fresh, pasta, for, cavatelli, is, also, popular, in, other, places, including, sicily, however, the, dough, is, prepared, differently, it, is, made, of, flour, and, ricotta, cheese, instead, dried, pasta, can, also, be, defined, as, factory, made, pasta, because, it, is, usually, produced, in, large, amounts, that, require, large, machines, with, superior, processing, capabilities, to, manufacture, dried, pasta, can, be, shipped, further, and, has, a, longer, shelf, life, the, ingredients, required, to, make, dried, pasta, include, semolina, flour, and, water, eggs, can, be, added, for, flavor, and, richness, but, are, not, needed, to, make, dried, pasta, in, contrast, to, fresh, pasta, dried, pasta, needs, to, be, dried, at, a, low, temperature, for, several, days, to, evaporate, all, the, moisture, allowing, it, to, be, stored, for, a, longer, period, dried, pastas, are, best, served, in, hearty, dishes, such, as, rag, sauces, soups, and, casseroles, once, it, is, cooked, the, dried, pasta, will, usually, grow, to, twice, its, original, size, therefore, approximately, 0, 5, kg, 1, lb, of, dried, pasta, serves, up, to, four, people, pasta, whether, dry, or, fresh, is, eaten, after, cooking, it, in, hot, water, for, italian, pasta, which, is, unsalted, salt, is, added, to, the, cooking, water, this, is, not, the, case, for, asian, wheat, noodles, such, as, udon, and, lo, mein, which, are, made, from, salty, dough, in, italy, pasta, is, often, cooked, to, be, al, dente, such, that, it, is, still, firm, to, the, bite, this, is, because, it, is, then, often, cooked, in, the, sauce, for, a, short, time, which, makes, it, soften, further, there, are, number, of, urban, myths, about, how, pasta, should, be, cooked, in, fact, it, does, not, generally, matter, whether, pasta, is, cooked, at, a, lower, or, a, higher, temperature, although, lower, temperatures, require, more, stirring, to, avoid, sticking, and, certain, stuffed, pasta, such, as, tortellini, break, up, in, higher, temperatures, it, also, does, not, matter, whether, salt, is, added, before, or, after, bringing, the, water, to, a, boil, the, amount, of, salt, has, no, influence, on, cooking, speed, pasta, is, generally, served, with, some, type, of, sauce, the, sauce, and, the, type, of, pasta, are, usually, matched, based, on, consistency, and, ease, of, eating, northern, italian, cooking, uses, less, tomato, sauce, garlic, and, herbs, and, b, chamel, sauce, is, more, common, however, italian, cuisine, is, best, identified, by, individual, regions, pasta, dishes, with, lighter, use, of, tomato, are, found, in, trentino, alto, adige, and, emilia, romagna, regions, of, northern, italy, in, bologna, the, meat, based, bolognese, sauce, incorporates, a, small, amount, of, tomato, concentrate, and, a, green, sauce, called, pesto, originates, from, genoa, in, central, italy, there, are, sauces, such, as, tomato, sauce, amatriciana, arrabbiata, and, the, egg, based, carbonara, tomato, sauces, are, also, present, in, southern, italian, cuisine, where, they, originated, in, southern, italy, more, complex, variations, include, pasta, paired, with, fresh, vegetables, olives, capers, or, seafood, varieties, include, puttanesca, pasta, alla, norma, tomatoes, eggplant, and, fresh, or, baked, cheese, pasta, con, le, sarde, fresh, sardines, pine, nuts, fennel, and, olive, oil, spaghetti, aglio, olio, e, peperoncino, lit, spaghetti, with, garlic, oil, and, hot, chili, peppers, pasta, con, i, peperoni, cruschi, crispy, peppers, and, breadcrumbs, pasta, can, be, served, also, in, broth, pastina, or, stuffed, pasta, such, as, tortellini, cappelletti, and, agnolini, or, in, vegetable, soup, typically, minestrone, or, bean, soup, pasta, e, fagioli, ingredients, to, make, pasta, dough, include, semolina, flour, egg, salt, and, water, flour, is, first, mounded, on, a, flat, surface, and, then, a, well, in, the, pile, of, flour, is, created, egg, is, then, poured, into, the, well, and, a, fork, is, used, to, mix, the, egg, and, flour, there, are, a, variety, of, ways, to, shape, the, sheets, of, pasta, depending, on, the, type, required, the, most, popular, types, include, penne, spaghetti, and, macaroni, kitchen, pasta, machines, also, called, pasta, makers, are, popular, with, cooks, who, make, large, amounts, of, fresh, pasta, the, cook, feeds, sheets, of, pasta, dough, into, the, machine, by, hand, and, by, turning, a, hand, crank, rolls, the, pasta, to, thin, it, incrementally, on, the, final, pass, through, the, pasta, machine, the, pasta, may, be, directed, through, a, machine, comb, to, shape, of, the, pasta, as, it, emerges, semolina, flour, consists, of, a, protein, matrix, with, entrapped, starch, granules, upon, the, addition, of, water, during, mixing, intermolecular, forces, allow, the, protein, to, form, a, more, ordered, structure, in, preparation, for, cooking, durum, wheat, is, ground, into, semolina, flour, which, is, sorted, by, optical, scanners, and, cleaned, pipes, allow, the, flour, to, move, to, a, mixing, machine, where, it, is, mixed, with, warm, water, by, rotating, blades, when, the, mixture, is, of, a, lumpy, consistency, the, mixture, is, pressed, into, sheets, or, extruded, varieties, of, pasta, such, as, spaghetti, and, linguine, are, cut, by, rotating, blades, while, pasta, such, as, penne, and, fusilli, are, extruded, the, size, and, shape, of, the, dies, in, the, extruder, through, which, the, pasta, is, pushed, determine, the, shape, that, results, the, pasta, is, then, dried, at, a, high, temperature, the, ingredients, to, make, dried, pasta, usually, include, water, and, semolina, flour, egg, for, color, and, richness, in, some, types, of, pasta, and, possibly, vegetable, juice, such, as, spinach, beet, tomato, carrot, herbs, or, spices, for, color, and, flavor, after, mixing, semolina, flour, with, warm, water, the, dough, is, kneaded, mechanically, until, it, becomes, firm, and, dry, if, pasta, is, to, be, flavored, eggs, vegetable, juices, and, herbs, are, added, at, this, stage, the, dough, is, then, passed, into, the, laminator, to, be, flattened, into, sheets, then, compressed, by, a, vacuum, mixer, machine, to, clear, out, air, bubbles, and, excess, water, from, the, dough, until, the, moisture, content, is, reduced, to, 12, next, the, dough, is, processed, in, a, steamer, to, kill, any, bacteria, it, may, contain, the, dough, is, then, ready, to, be, shaped, into, different, types, of, pasta, depending, on, the, type, of, pasta, to, be, made, the, dough, can, either, be, cut, or, extruded, through, dies, the, pasta, is, set, in, a, drying, tank, under, specific, conditions, of, heat, moisture, and, time, depending, on, the, type, of, pasta, the, dried, pasta, is, then, packaged, fresh, pasta, is, sealed, in, a, clear, airtight, plastic, container, with, a, mixture, of, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, that, inhibits, microbial, growth, and, prolongs, the, product, s, shelf, life, dried, pastas, are, sealed, in, clear, plastic, or, cardboard, packages, gluten, the, protein, found, in, grains, such, as, wheat, rye, spelt, and, barley, contributes, to, protein, aggregation, and, firm, texture, of, a, normally, cooked, pasta, gluten, free, pasta, is, produced, with, wheat, flour, substitutes, such, as, vegetable, powders, rice, corn, quinoa, amaranth, oats, and, buckwheat, flours, other, possible, gluten, free, pasta, ingredients, may, include, hydrocolloids, to, improve, cooking, pasta, with, high, heat, resistance, xanthan, gum, to, retain, moisture, during, storage, or, hydrothermally, treated, polysaccharide, mixtures, to, produce, textures, similar, to, those, of, wheat, pasta, the, storage, of, pasta, depends, on, its, processing, and, extent, of, drying, uncooked, pasta, is, kept, dry, and, can, sit, in, the, cupboard, for, a, year, if, airtight, and, stored, in, a, cool, dry, area, cooked, pasta, is, stored, in, the, refrigerator, for, a, maximum, of, five, days, in, an, airtight, container, adding, a, couple, teaspoons, of, oil, helps, keep, the, food, from, sticking, to, itself, and, the, container, cooked, pasta, may, be, frozen, for, up, to, two, or, three, months, should, the, pasta, be, dried, completely, it, can, be, placed, back, in, the, cupboard, pasta, exhibits, a, random, molecular, order, rather, than, a, crystalline, structure, the, moisture, content, of, dried, pasta, is, typically, around, 12, indicating, that, dried, pasta, will, remain, a, brittle, solid, until, it, is, cooked, and, becomes, malleable, the, cooked, product, is, as, a, result, softer, more, flexible, and, chewy, semolina, flour, is, the, ground, endosperm, of, durum, wheat, producing, granules, that, absorb, water, during, heating, and, an, increase, in, viscosity, due, to, semi, reordering, of, starch, molecules, another, major, component, of, durum, wheat, is, protein, which, plays, a, large, role, in, pasta, dough, rheology, gluten, proteins, which, include, monomeric, gliadins, and, polymeric, glutenin, make, up, the, major, protein, component, of, durum, wheat, about, 75, 80, as, more, water, is, added, and, shear, stress, is, applied, gluten, proteins, take, on, an, elastic, characteristic, and, begin, to, form, strands, and, sheets, the, gluten, matrix, that, results, during, forming, of, the, dough, becomes, irreversibly, associated, during, drying, as, the, moisture, content, is, lowered, to, form, the, dried, pasta, product, before, the, mixing, process, takes, place, semolina, particles, are, irregularly, shaped, and, present, in, different, sizes, semolina, particles, become, hydrated, during, mixing, the, amount, of, water, added, to, the, semolina, is, determined, based, on, the, initial, moisture, content, of, the, flour, and, the, desired, shape, of, the, pasta, the, desired, moisture, content, of, the, dough, is, around, 32, wet, basis, and, will, vary, depending, on, the, shape, of, pasta, being, produced, the, forming, process, involves, the, dough, entering, an, extruder, in, which, the, rotation, of, a, single, or, double, screw, system, pushes, the, dough, toward, a, die, set, to, a, specific, shape, as, the, starch, granules, swell, slightly, in, the, presence, of, water, and, a, low, amount, of, thermal, energy, they, become, embedded, within, the, protein, matrix, and, align, along, the, direction, of, the, shear, caused, by, the, extrusion, process, starch, gelatinization, and, protein, coagulation, are, the, major, changes, that, take, place, when, pasta, is, cooked, in, boiling, water, protein, and, starch, competing, for, water, within, the, pasta, cause, a, constant, change, in, structure, as, the, pasta, cooks, in, 2015, 16, the, largest, producers, of, dried, pasta, were, italy, 3, 2, million, tonnes, united, states, 2, million, tonnes, turkey, 1, 3, million, tons, brazil, 1, 2, million, tonnes, and, russia, 1, million, tons, in, 2018, italy, was, the, world, s, largest, exporter, of, pasta, with, 2, 9, billion, sold, followed, by, china, with, 0, 9, billion, the, largest, per, capita, consumers, of, pasta, in, 2015, were, italy, 23, 5, kg, person, tunisia, 16, 0, kg, person, venezuela, 12, 0, kg, person, and, greece, 11, 2, kg, person, in, 2017, the, united, states, was, the, largest, consumer, of, pasta, with, 2, 7, million, tons, when, cooked, plain, pasta, is, composed, of, 62, water, 31, carbohydrates, 26, starch, 6, protein, and, 1, fat, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, oz, portion, of, unenriched, cooked, pasta, provides, 670, kilojoules, 160, kcal, of, food, energy, and, a, moderate, level, of, manganese, 15, of, the, daily, value, but, few, other, micronutrients, pasta, has, a, lower, glycemic, index, than, many, other, staple, foods, in, western,
