a, fireplace, or, hearth, is, a, structure, made, of, brick, stone, or, metal, designed, to, contain, a, fire, fireplaces, are, used, for, the, relaxing, ambiance, they, create, and, for, heating, a, room, modern, fireplaces, vary, in, heat, efficiency, depending, on, the, design, historically, they, were, used, for, heating, a, dwelling, cooking, and, heating, water, for, laundry, and, domestic, uses, a, fire, is, contained, in, a, firebox, or, fire, pit, a, chimney, or, other, flue, allows, exhaust, gas, to, escape, a, fireplace, may, have, the, following, a, foundation, a, hearth, a, firebox, a, mantel, a, chimney, crane, used, in, kitchen, and, laundry, fireplaces, a, grate, a, lintel, a, lintel, bar, an, overmantel, a, damper, a, smoke, chamber, a, throat, a, flue, and, a, chimney, filter, or, afterburner, on, the, exterior, there, is, often, a, corbelled, brick, crown, in, which, the, projecting, courses, of, brick, act, as, a, drip, course, to, keep, rainwater, from, running, down, the, exterior, walls, a, cap, hood, or, shroud, serves, to, keep, rainwater, out, of, the, exterior, of, the, chimney, rain, in, the, chimney, is, a, much, greater, problem, in, chimneys, lined, with, impervious, flue, tiles, or, metal, liners, than, with, the, traditional, masonry, chimney, which, soaks, up, all, but, the, most, violent, rain, some, chimneys, have, a, spark, arrestor, incorporated, into, the, crown, or, cap, organizations, like, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, and, the, washington, state, department, of, ecology, warn, that, according, to, various, studies, fireplaces, can, pose, health, risks, the, epa, writes, smoke, may, smell, good, but, it, s, not, good, for, you, masonry, and, prefabricated, fireplaces, can, be, fueled, by, ventless, fireplaces, duct, free, room, venting, fireplaces, are, fueled, by, either, gel, liquid, propane, bottled, gas, or, natural, gas, in, the, united, states, some, states, and, local, counties, have, laws, restricting, these, types, of, fireplaces, they, must, be, properly, sized, to, the, area, to, be, heated, there, are, also, air, quality, control, issues, due, to, the, amount, of, moisture, they, release, into, the, room, air, and, an, oxygen, sensor, and, a, carbon, monoxide, detector, are, safety, essentials, direct, vent, fireplaces, are, fueled, by, either, liquid, propane, or, natural, gas, they, are, completely, sealed, from, the, area, that, is, heated, and, vent, all, exhaust, gasses, to, the, exterior, of, the, structure, chimney, and, flue, types, newly, constructed, flues, may, feature, a, chase, cover, a, cap, and, a, spark, arrestor, at, the, top, to, keep, small, animals, out, and, to, prevent, sparks, from, being, broadcast, into, the, atmosphere, all, gas, fireplaces, require, trained, gas, service, members, to, carry, out, installations, a, wide, range, of, accessories, are, used, with, fireplaces, which, range, between, countries, regions, and, historical, periods, for, the, interior, common, in, recent, western, cultures, include, grates, fireguards, log, boxes, andirons, and, pellet, baskets, all, of, which, cradle, fuel, and, accelerate, combustion, a, grate, or, fire, grate, is, a, frame, usually, of, iron, bars, to, retain, fuel, for, a, fire, heavy, metal, firebacks, are, sometimes, used, to, capture, and, re, radiate, heat, to, protect, the, back, of, the, fireplace, and, as, decoration, fenders, are, low, metal, frames, set, in, front, of, the, fireplace, to, contain, embers, soot, and, ash, for, fireplace, tending, tools, include, pokers, bellows, tongs, shovels, brushes, and, tool, stands, other, wider, accessories, can, include, log, baskets, companion, sets, coal, buckets, cabinet, accessories, and, more, ancient, fire, pits, were, sometimes, built, in, the, ground, within, caves, or, in, the, center, of, a, hut, or, dwelling, evidence, of, prehistoric, man, made, fires, exists, on, all, five, inhabited, continents, the, disadvantage, of, early, indoor, fire, pits, was, that, they, produced, toxic, and, or, irritating, smoke, inside, the, dwelling, fire, pits, developed, into, raised, hearths, in, buildings, but, venting, smoke, depended, on, open, windows, or, holes, in, roofs, the, medieval, great, hall, typically, had, a, centrally, located, hearth, where, an, open, fire, burned, with, the, smoke, rising, to, the, vent, in, the, roof, louvers, were, developed, during, the, middle, ages, to, allow, the, roof, vents, to, be, covered, so, rain, and, snow, would, not, enter, also, during, the, middle, ages, smoke, canopies, were, invented, to, prevent, smoke, from, spreading, through, a, room, and, vent, it, out, through, a, wall, or, roof, these, could, be, placed, against, stone, walls, instead, of, taking, up, the, middle, of, the, room, and, this, allowed, smaller, rooms, to, be, heated, chimneys, were, invented, in, northern, europe, in, the, 11th, or, 12th, century, and, largely, fixed, the, problem, of, smoke, more, reliably, venting, it, outside, they, made, it, possible, to, give, the, fireplace, a, draft, and, also, made, it, possible, to, put, fireplaces, in, multiple, rooms, in, buildings, conveniently, they, did, not, come, into, general, use, immediately, however, as, they, were, expensive, to, build, and, maintain, in, 1678, prince, rupert, nephew, of, charles, i, raised, the, grate, of, the, fireplace, improving, the, airflow, and, venting, system, the, 18th, century, saw, two, important, developments, in, the, history, of, fireplaces, benjamin, franklin, developed, a, convection, chamber, for, the, fireplace, that, greatly, improved, the, efficiency, of, fireplaces, and, wood, burning, stoves, he, also, improved, the, airflow, by, pulling, air, from, a, basement, and, venting, out, a, longer, area, at, the, top, in, the, later, 18th, century, count, rumford, designed, a, fireplace, with, a, tall, shallow, firebox, that, was, better, at, drawing, the, smoke, up, and, out, of, the, building, the, shallow, design, also, improved, greatly, the, amount, of, heat, transfer, projected, into, the, room, rumford, s, design, is, the, foundation, for, modern, fireplaces, the, aesthetic, movement, of, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, took, on, a, more, traditional, spectra, based, on, stone, and, deflected, unnecessary, ornamentation, rather, it, relied, on, simple, designs, with, little, unnecessary, ornamentation, in, the, 1890s, the, aesthetic, movement, gave, way, to, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, where, the, emphasis, was, still, placed, on, providing, quality, stone, stone, fireplaces, at, this, time, were, a, symbol, of, prosperity, which, to, some, degree, is, still, the, notion, today, over, time, the, purpose, of, fireplaces, has, changed, from, one, of, necessity, to, one, of, visual, interest, early, ones, were, more, fire, pits, than, modern, fireplaces, they, were, used, for, warmth, on, cold, days, and, nights, as, well, as, for, cooking, they, also, served, as, a, gathering, place, within, the, home, these, fire, pits, were, usually, centered, within, a, room, allowing, more, people, to, gather, around, it, many, flaws, were, found, in, early, fireplace, designs, along, with, the, industrial, revolution, came, large, scale, housing, developments, necessitating, a, standardization, of, fireplaces, the, most, renowned, fireplace, designers, of, this, time, were, the, adam, brothers, john, adam, robert, adam, and, james, adam, they, perfected, a, style, of, fireplace, design, that, was, used, for, generations, it, was, smaller, more, brightly, lit, with, an, emphasis, on, the, quality, of, the, materials, used, in, their, construction, instead, of, their, size, by, the, 1800s, most, new, fireplaces, were, made, up, of, two, parts, the, surround, and, the, insert, the, surround, consisted, of, the, mantelpiece, and, side, supports, usually, in, wood, marble, or, granite, the, insert, was, where, the, fire, burned, and, was, constructed, of, cast, iron, often, backed, with, decorative, tiles, as, well, as, providing, heat, the, fireplaces, of, the, victorian, era, were, thought, to, add, a, cosy, ambiance, to, homes, in, the, us, state, of, wisconsin, some, elementary, classrooms, would, contain, decorated, fireplaces, to, ease, children, s, transition, from, home, to, school, some, fireplace, units, incorporate, a, blower, which, transfers, more, of, the, fireplace, s, heat, to, the, air, via, convection, resulting, in, a, more, evenly, heated, space, and, a, lower, heating, load, fireplace, efficiency, can, also, be, increased, with, the, use, of, a, fireback, a, piece, of, metal, that, sits, behind, the, fire, and, reflects, heat, back, into, the, room, firebacks, are, traditionally, made, from, cast, iron, but, are, also, made, from, stainless, steel, most, older, fireplaces, have, a, relatively, low, efficiency, rating, standard, modern, wood, burning, masonry, fireplaces, though, have, an, efficiency, rating, of, at, least, 80, legal, minimum, requirement, for, example, in, salzburg, austria, to, improve, efficiency, fireplaces, can, also, be, modified, by, inserting, special, heavy, fireboxes, designed, to, burn, much, cleaner, and, can, reach, efficiencies, as, high, as, 80, in, heating, the, air, these, modified, fireplaces, are, often, equipped, with, a, large, fire, window, enabling, an, efficient, heating, process, in, two, phases, during, the, first, phase, the, initial, heat, is, provided, through, a, large, glass, window, while, the, fire, is, burning, during, this, time, the, structure, built, of, refractory, bricks, absorbs, the, heat, this, heat, is, then, evenly, radiated, for, many, hours, during, the, second, phase, masonry, fireplaces, without, a, glass, fire, window, only, provide, heat, radiated, from, its, surface, depending, on, the, outside, temperature, 1, to, 2, daily, firings, are, sufficient, to, ensure, a, constant, room, temperature, a, literature, review, published, in, the, journal, of, toxicology, and, environmental, health, concludes, that, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, health, risks, posed, by, residential, wood, combustion, it, states, with, regard, to, adults, studies, show, that, prolonged, inhalation, of, wood, smoke, contributed, to, chronic, bronchitis, chronic, interstitial, lung, disease, pulmonary, arterial, hypertension, and, corpulmonale, pulmonary, heart, disease, and, altered, pulmonary, immune, defense, mechanisms, while, adverse, effects, on, adults, are, notable, children, appear, to, be, at, greatest, risk, many, studies, that, focused, specifically, on, rwc, have, concluded, that, young, children, living, in, homes, heated, by, a, wood, burning, stove, had, a, greater, occurrence, of, moderate, and, severe, chronic, respiratory, symptoms, than, children, of, the, same, age, and, sex, who, did, not, live, in, homes, heated, with, a, wood, burning, stove, exposure, of, preschool, children, living, in, homes, heated, with, wood, burning, stoves, or, in, houses, with, open, fireplaces, yielded, these, effects, decreased, pulmonary, lung, function, in, young, asthmatics, increased, incidence, of, acute, bronchitis, and, severity, frequency, of, wheezing, and, coughing, and, increased, incidence, duration, and, possibly, severity, of, acute, respiratory, infections, residential, wood, combustion, emissions, also, contain, sulfur, oxides, nitrogen, oxides, carbon, monoxide, and, potentially, carcinogenic, compounds, including, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, benzene, formaldehyde, and, dioxins, some, of, these, pollutants, are, known, to, cause, cancer, but, their, effects, on, human, health, via, exposure, to, wood, smoke, have, not, been, extensively, studied, the, washington, state, department, of, ecology, also, published, a, booklet, explaining, why, wood, smoke, can, be, dangerous, it, explains, that, human, lung, and, respiratory, systems, are, unable, to, filter, particulates, emitted, by, wood, combustion, which, penetrate, deeply, into, the, lungs, for, months, carcinogens, can, continue, to, cause, changes, and, structural, damage, within, the, respiratory, system, young, children, seniors, pregnant, women, smokers, and, individuals, with, respiratory, diseases, are, most, vulnerable, wood, smoke, can, cause, disease, and, even, death, in, children, because, it, is, associated, with, lower, respiratory, tract, infections, home, fireplaces, have, caused, fatal, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, propane, butane, and, methane, are, all, flammable, gases, used, in, fireplaces, natural, gas, is, mostly, methane, liquefied, petroleum, gas, mostly, propane, if, they, are, allowed, to, accumulate, unburned, gases, can, cause, asphyxia, by, displacing, air, and, gas, explosions, ethanol, a, liquid, also, sold, in, gels, fires, can, also, cause, severe, burns, burning, hydrocarbons, can, decrease, indoor, air, quality, emissions, include, airborne, particulate, matter, such, as, black, carbon, and, gases, like, nitrogen, oxide, these, harm, health, they, weaken, the, immune, system, and, increase, infections, blood, pressure, cardiovascular, diseases, and, insulin, resistance, some, forms, of, fuel, are, more, harmful, than, others, burning, hydrocarbon, fuels, incompletely, can, produce, carbon, monoxide, which, is, highly, poisonous, and, can, cause, death, and, long, term, neurological, disorders, burning, any, hydrocarbon, fuel, releases, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, other, emissions, such, as, nitrogen, oxides, and, sulfur, oxides, can, be, harmful, to, the, environment, several, of, these, terms, may, be, compounded, with, chimney, or, fireplace, such, as, chimney, back
