adolescence, from, latin, adolescere, to, mature, is, a, transitional, stage, of, physical, and, psychological, development, that, generally, occurs, during, the, period, from, puberty, to, adulthood, typically, corresponding, to, the, age, of, majority, adolescence, is, usually, associated, with, the, teenage, years, but, its, physical, psychological, or, cultural, expressions, may, begin, earlier, or, end, later, puberty, typically, begins, during, preadolescence, particularly, in, females, physical, growth, particularly, in, males, and, cognitive, development, can, extend, past, the, teens, age, provides, only, a, rough, marker, of, adolescence, and, scholars, have, not, agreed, upon, a, precise, definition, some, definitions, start, as, early, as, 10, and, end, as, late, as, 30, the, world, health, organization, definition, officially, designates, an, adolescent, as, someone, between, the, ages, of, 10, and, 19, puberty, is, a, period, of, several, years, in, which, rapid, physical, growth, and, psychological, changes, occur, culminating, in, sexual, maturity, the, average, age, of, onset, of, puberty, is, 10, 11, for, girls, and, 11, 12, for, boys, every, person, s, individual, timetable, for, puberty, is, influenced, primarily, by, heredity, although, environmental, factors, such, as, diet, and, exercise, also, exert, some, influences, these, factors, can, also, contribute, to, precocious, and, delayed, puberty, some, of, the, most, significant, parts, of, pubertal, development, involve, distinctive, physiological, changes, in, individuals, height, weight, body, composition, and, circulatory, and, respiratory, systems, these, changes, are, largely, influenced, by, hormonal, activity, hormones, play, an, organizational, role, priming, the, body, to, behave, in, a, certain, way, once, puberty, begins, and, an, active, role, referring, to, changes, in, hormones, during, adolescence, that, trigger, behavioral, and, physical, changes, puberty, occurs, through, a, long, process, and, begins, with, a, surge, in, hormone, production, which, in, turn, causes, a, number, of, physical, changes, it, is, the, stage, of, life, characterized, by, the, appearance, and, development, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, for, example, a, deeper, voice, and, larger, adam, s, apple, in, boys, and, development, of, breasts, and, more, curved, and, prominent, hips, in, girls, and, a, strong, shift, in, hormonal, balance, towards, an, adult, state, this, is, triggered, by, the, pituitary, gland, which, secretes, a, surge, of, hormonal, agents, into, the, blood, stream, initiating, a, chain, reaction, the, male, and, female, gonads, are, thereby, activated, which, puts, them, into, a, state, of, rapid, growth, and, development, the, triggered, gonads, now, commence, mass, production, of, hormones, the, testes, primarily, release, testosterone, and, the, ovaries, predominantly, dispense, estrogen, the, production, of, these, hormones, increases, gradually, until, sexual, maturation, is, met, some, boys, may, develop, gynecomastia, due, to, an, imbalance, of, sex, hormones, tissue, responsiveness, or, obesity, facial, hair, in, males, normally, appears, in, a, specific, order, during, puberty, the, first, facial, hair, to, appear, tends, to, grow, at, the, corners, of, the, upper, lip, typically, between, 14, and, 17, years, of, age, it, then, spreads, to, form, a, moustache, over, the, entire, upper, lip, this, is, followed, by, the, appearance, of, hair, on, the, upper, part, of, the, cheeks, and, the, area, under, the, lower, lip, the, hair, eventually, spreads, to, the, sides, and, lower, border, of, the, chin, and, the, rest, of, the, lower, face, to, form, a, full, beard, as, with, most, human, biological, processes, this, specific, order, may, vary, among, some, individuals, facial, hair, is, often, present, in, late, adolescence, around, ages, 17, and, 18, but, may, not, appear, until, significantly, later, some, men, do, not, develop, full, facial, hair, for, 10, years, after, puberty, facial, hair, continues, to, get, coarser, much, darker, and, thicker, for, another, 2, 4, years, after, puberty, the, major, landmark, of, puberty, for, males, is, spermarche, the, first, ejaculation, which, occurs, on, average, at, age, 13, for, females, it, is, menarche, the, onset, of, menstruation, which, occurs, on, average, between, ages, 12, and, 13, the, age, of, menarche, is, influenced, by, heredity, but, a, girl, s, diet, and, lifestyle, contribute, as, well, regardless, of, genes, a, girl, must, have, a, certain, proportion, of, body, fat, to, attain, menarche, consequently, girls, who, have, a, high, fat, diet, and, who, are, not, physically, active, begin, menstruating, earlier, on, average, than, girls, whose, diet, contains, less, fat, and, whose, activities, involve, fat, reducing, exercise, e, g, ballet, and, gymnastics, girls, who, experience, malnutrition, or, are, in, societies, in, which, children, are, expected, to, perform, physical, labor, also, begin, menstruating, at, later, ages, the, timing, of, puberty, can, have, important, psychological, and, social, consequences, early, maturing, boys, are, usually, taller, and, stronger, than, their, friends, they, have, the, advantage, in, capturing, the, attention, of, potential, partners, and, in, being, picked, first, for, sports, pubescent, boys, often, tend, to, have, a, good, body, image, are, more, confident, secure, and, more, independent, late, maturing, boys, can, be, less, confident, because, of, poor, body, image, when, comparing, themselves, to, already, developed, friends, and, peers, however, early, puberty, is, not, always, positive, for, boys, early, sexual, maturation, in, boys, can, be, accompanied, by, increased, aggressiveness, due, to, the, surge, of, hormones, that, affect, them, because, they, appear, older, than, their, peers, pubescent, boys, may, face, increased, social, pressure, to, conform, to, adult, norms, society, may, view, them, as, more, emotionally, advanced, despite, the, fact, that, their, cognitive, and, social, development, may, lag, behind, their, appearance, studies, have, shown, that, early, maturing, boys, are, more, likely, to, be, sexually, active, and, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, risky, behaviors, for, girls, early, maturation, can, sometimes, lead, to, increased, self, consciousness, a, typical, aspect, in, maturing, females, because, of, their, bodies, developing, in, advance, pubescent, girls, can, become, more, insecure, and, dependent, consequently, girls, that, reach, sexual, maturation, early, are, more, likely, than, their, peers, to, develop, eating, disorders, such, as, anorexia, nervosa, nearly, half, of, all, american, high, school, girls, diets, are, to, lose, weight, in, addition, girls, may, have, to, deal, with, sexual, advances, from, older, boys, before, they, are, emotionally, and, mentally, mature, in, addition, to, having, earlier, sexual, experiences, and, more, unwanted, pregnancies, than, late, maturing, girls, early, maturing, girls, are, more, exposed, to, alcohol, and, drug, abuse, those, who, have, had, such, experiences, tend, to, not, perform, as, well, in, school, as, their, inexperienced, peers, girls, have, usually, reached, full, physical, development, around, ages, 15, 17, while, boys, usually, complete, puberty, around, ages, 16, 17, any, increase, in, height, beyond, the, post, pubertal, age, is, uncommon, girls, attain, reproductive, maturity, about, four, years, after, the, first, physical, changes, of, puberty, appear, in, contrast, boys, develop, more, slowly, but, continue, to, grow, for, about, six, years, after, the, first, visible, pubertal, changes, the, physical, development, of, girls, during, their, teenage, years, can, be, broken, down, into, three, distinct, stages, at, the, start, which, generally, coincides, with, the, beginning, of, rapid, growth, there, is, the, development, of, breast, buds, and, pubic, hair, the, peak, period, of, physical, growth, occurs, approximately, one, year, later, in, concert, with, stage, two, of, sexual, maturity, approximately, 1, to, 1, 6, years, after, the, onset, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, girls, enter, into, the, third, stage, which, typically, includes, menarche, by, this, time, they, will, have, finished, their, growth, spurt, and, experience, a, notable, broadening, of, the, hips, as, well, as, an, adult, fat, distribution, additionally, breast, development, is, complete, and, hair, in, both, the, pubic, region, and, armpits, axillary, hair, will, be, darker, and, more, widespread, in, comparison, to, girls, it, can, be, tricky, to, define, when, exactly, sexual, development, in, boys, begins, for, boys, puberty, typically, takes, around, 5, years, to, finish, as, opposed, to, just, 3, 1, 2, years, for, girls, menarche, by, this, point, in, time, they, have, already, experienced, their, growth, spurt, and, there, are, evident, changes, in, their, body, shape, wider, hips, and, fat, distribution, is, more, adult, like, breast, development, will, also, be, completed, by, this, stage, in, boys, four, stages, in, development, can, be, correlated, with, the, curve, of, general, body, growth, at, adolescence, the, initial, sign, of, sexual, maturation, in, boys, usually, is, the, fat, spurt, the, maturing, boy, gains, weight, and, becomes, almost, chubby, with, a, somewhat, feminine, fat, distribution, this, probably, occurs, because, estrogen, production, by, the, leydig, cells, in, the, testes, is, stimulated, before, the, more, abundant, sertoli, cells, begin, to, produce, significant, amounts, of, testosterone, during, this, stage, boys, may, appear, obese, and, somewhat, awkward, physically, approximately, 1, year, after, the, scrotum, begins, to, increase, in, size, stage, ii, can, be, seen, during, this, time, there, is, a, redistribution, of, subcutaneous, fat, and, the, start, of, pubic, hair, growth, following, 8, to, 12, months, of, the, peak, velocity, in, height, gain, stage, iii, ensues, this, period, is, marked, by, an, obvious, widenening, of, hips, with, a, more, adult, like, fat, distribution, and, full, development, of, the, breasts, all, together, these, three, stages, culminate, in, a, complete, growth, spurt, for, most, individuals, at, this, time, axillary, hair, appears, and, facial, hair, appears, on, the, upper, lip, only, a, spurt, in, muscle, growth, also, occurs, along, with, a, continued, decrease, in, subcutaneous, fat, and, an, obviously, harder, and, more, angular, body, form, pubic, hair, distribution, appears, more, adult, but, has, not, yet, spread, to, the, medial, area, of, the, thighs, the, penis, and, scrotum, are, near, adult, size, stage, iv, for, boys, which, occurs, anywhere, from, 15, to, 24, months, after, stage, iii, is, difficult, to, pinpoint, at, this, time, the, spurt, of, growth, in, height, ends, there, is, facial, hair, on, the, chin, and, the, upper, lip, adult, distribution, and, color, of, pubic, and, axillary, hair, and, a, further, increase, in, muscular, strength, the, adolescent, growth, spurt, is, a, rapid, increase, in, the, individual, s, height, and, weight, during, puberty, resulting, from, the, simultaneous, release, of, growth, hormones, thyroid, hormones, and, androgens, 55, 56, males, experience, their, growth, spurt, about, two, years, later, on, average, than, females, during, their, peak, height, velocity, the, time, of, most, rapid, growth, adolescents, grow, at, a, growth, rate, nearly, identical, to, that, of, a, toddler, about, 10, 3, cm, 4, inches, per, year, for, males, and, 9, cm, 3, 5, inches, per, year, for, females, in, addition, to, changes, in, height, adolescents, also, experience, a, significant, increase, in, weight, marshall, 1978, the, weight, gained, during, adolescence, constitutes, nearly, half, of, one, s, adult, body, weight, teenage, and, early, adult, males, may, continue, to, gain, natural, muscle, growth, even, after, puberty, the, accelerated, growth, in, different, body, parts, happens, at, different, times, but, for, all, adolescents, it, has, a, fairly, regular, sequence, the, first, places, to, grow, are, the, extremities, the, head, hands, and, feet, followed, by, the, arms, and, legs, then, the, torso, and, shoulders, this, non, uniform, growth, is, one, reason, why, an, adolescent, body, may, seem, out, of, proportion, during, puberty, bones, become, harder, and, more, brittle, at, the, conclusion, of, puberty, the, ends, of, the, long, bones, close, during, the, process, called, epiphysis, there, can, be, ethnic, differences, in, these, skeletal, changes, for, example, in, the, united, states, bone, density, increases, significantly, more, among, black, than, white, adolescents, which, might, account, for, decreased, likelihood, of, black, women, developing, osteoporosis, and, having, fewer, bone, fractures, there, another, set, of, significant, physical, changes, during, puberty, happen, in, bodily, distribution, of, fat, and, muscle, this, process, is, different, for, females, and, males, before, puberty, there, are, nearly, no, sex, differences, in, fat, and, muscle, distribution, during, puberty, boys, grow, muscle, much, faster, than, girls, although, both, sexes, experience, rapid, muscle, development, in, contrast, though, both, sexes, experience, an, increase, in, body, fat, the, increase, is, much, more, significant, for, girls, frequently, the, increase, in, fat, for, girls, happens, in, their, years, just, before, puberty, the, ratio, between, muscle, and, fat, among, post, pubertal, boys, is, around, three, to, one, while, for, girls, it, is, about, five, to, four, this, may, help, explain, sex, differences, in, athletic, performance, pubertal, development, also, affects, circulatory, and, respiratory, systems, as, an, adolescents, heart, and, lungs, increase, in, both, size, and, capacity, these, changes, lead, to, increased, strength, and, tolerance, for, exercise, sex, differences, are, apparent, as, males, tend, to, develop, larger, hearts, and, lungs, higher, systolic, blood, pressure, a, lower, resting, heart, rate, a, greater, capacity, for, carrying, oxygen, to, the, blood, a, greater, power, for, neutralizing, the, chemical, products, of, muscular, exercise, higher, blood, hemoglobin, and, more, red, blood, cells, despite, some, genetic, sex, differences, environmental, factors, play, a, large, role, in, biological, changes, during, adolescence, for, example, girls, tend, to, reduce, their, physical, activity, in, preadolescence, and, may, receive, inadequate, nutrition, from, diets, that, often, lack, important, nutrients, such, as, iron, these, environmental, influences, in, turn, affect, female, physical, development, primary, sex, characteristics, are, those, directly, related, to, the, sex, organs, in, males, the, first, stages, of, puberty, involve, growth, of, the, testes, and, scrotum, followed, by, growth, of, the, penis, at, the, time, that, the, penis, develops, the, seminal, vesicles, the, prostate, and, the, bulbourethral, gland, also, enlarge, and, develop, the, first, ejaculation, of, seminal, fluid, generally, occurs, about, one, year, after, the, beginning, of, accelerated, penis, growth, although, this, is, often, determined, culturally, rather, than, biologically, since, for, many, boys, the, first, ejaculation, occurs, as, a, result, of, masturbation, boys, are, generally, fertile, before, they, have, an, adult, appearance, 54, in, females, changes, in, the, primary, sex, characteristics, involve, growth, of, the, uterus, vagina, and, other, aspects, of, the, reproductive, system, menarche, the, beginning, of, menstruation, is, a, relatively, late, development, which, follows, a, long, series, of, hormonal, changes, generally, a, girl, is, not, fully, fertile, until, several, years, after, menarche, as, regular, ovulation, follows, menarche, by, about, two, years, unlike, males, therefore, females, usually, appear, physically, mature, before, they, are, capable, of, becoming, pregnant, changes, in, secondary, sex, characteristics, include, every, change, that, is, not, directly, related, to, sexual, reproduction, in, males, these, changes, involve, appearance, of, pubic, facial, and, body, hair, deepening, of, the, voice, roughening, of, the, skin, around, the, upper, arms, and, thighs, and, increased, development, of, the, sweat, glands, in, females, secondary, sex, changes, involve, elevation, of, the, breasts, widening, of, the, hips, development, of, pubic, and, underarm, hair, widening, of, the, areolae, and, elevation, of, the, nipples, 57, 58, the, changes, in, secondary, sex, characteristics, that, take, place, during, puberty, are, often, referred, to, in, terms, of, five, tanner, stages, named, after, the, british, pediatrician, who, devised, the, categorization, system, the, human, brain, is, not, finished, developing, by, the, time, a, person, reaches, puberty, or, even, finishes, it, the, frontal, lobe, of, the, brain, has, been, known, to, shape, itself, well, into, one, s, 30s, neuroscientists, often, cannot, agree, precisely, on, when, this, developmental, period, ends, or, if, there, is, an, exact, age, for, the, end, of, brain, development, below, the, age, of, about, roughly, 30, the, human, brain, has, been, implicated, in, human, behavior, and, social, immaturity, however, there, has, been, no, empirical, study, indicating, a, causal, relationship, with, the, development, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, in, adolescence, and, into, early, adulthood, with, any, irrational, behaviors, the, brain, reaches, 90, of, its, adult, size, by, six, years, of, age, thus, the, brain, does, not, grow, in, size, much, during, adolescence, over, the, course, of, adolescence, the, amount, of, white, matter, in, the, brain, increases, linearly, while, the, amount, of, grey, matter, in, the, brain, follows, an, inverted, u, pattern, through, a, process, called, synaptic, pruning, unnecessary, neuronal, connections, in, the, brain, are, eliminated, and, the, amount, of, grey, matter, is, pared, down, however, this, does, not, mean, that, the, brain, loses, functionality, rather, it, becomes, more, efficient, due, to, increased, myelination, insulation, of, axons, and, the, reduction, of, unused, pathways, the, first, areas, of, the, brain, to, be, pruned, are, those, involving, primary, functions, such, as, motor, and, sensory, areas, the, areas, of, the, brain, involved, in, more, complex, processes, lose, matter, later, in, development, these, include, the, lateral, and, prefrontal, cortices, among, other, regions, some, of, the, most, developmentally, significant, changes, in, the, brain, occur, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, which, is, involved, in, decision, making, and, cognitive, control, as, well, as, other, higher, cognitive, functions, during, adolescence, myelination, and, synaptic, pruning, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, increases, improving, the, efficiency, of, information, processing, and, neural, connections, between, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, other, regions, of, the, brain, are, strengthened, this, leads, to, better, evaluation, of, risks, and, rewards, as, well, as, improved, control, over, impulses, specifically, developments, in, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, are, important, for, controlling, impulses, and, planning, ahead, while, development, in, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, is, important, for, decision, making, changes, in, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, are, important, for, evaluating, rewards, and, risks, three, neurotransmitters, that, play, important, roles, in, adolescent, brain, development, are, glutamate, dopamine, and, serotonin, glutamate, is, an, excitatory, neurotransmitter, during, the, synaptic, pruning, that, occurs, during, adolescence, most, of, the, neural, connections, that, are, pruned, contain, receptors, for, glutamate, or, other, excitatory, neurotransmitters, because, of, this, by, early, adulthood, the, synaptic, balance, in, the, brain, is, more, inhibitory, than, excitatory, dopamine, is, associated, with, pleasure, and, attuning, to, the, environment, during, decision, making, during, adolescence, dopamine, levels, in, the, limbic, system, increase, and, input, of, dopamine, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, increases, the, balance, of, excitatory, to, inhibitory, neurotransmitters, and, increased, dopamine, activity, in, adolescence, may, have, implications, for, adolescent, risk, taking, and, vulnerability, to, boredom, see, cognitive, development, below, serotonin, is, a, neuromodulator, involved, in, regulation, of, mood, and, behavior, development, in, the, limbic, system, plays, an, important, role, in, determining, rewards, and, punishments, and, processing, emotional, experience, and, social, information, changes, in, the, levels, of, the, neurotransmitters, dopamine, and, serotonin, in, the, limbic, system, make, adolescents, more, emotional, and, more, responsive, to, rewards, and, stress, the, corresponding, increase, in, emotional, variability, also, can, increase, adolescents, vulnerability, the, effect, of, serotonin, is, not, limited, to, the, limbic, system, several, serotonin, receptors, have, their, gene, expression, change, dramatically, during, adolescence, particularly, in, the, human, frontal, and, prefrontal, cortex, adolescence, is, a, time, of, rapid, cognitive, development, piaget, describes, adolescence, as, the, stage, of, life, in, which, the, individual, s, thoughts, start, taking, more, of, an, abstract, form, and, the, egocentric, thoughts, decrease, allowing, the, individual, to, think, and, reason, in, a, wider, perspective, a, combination, of, behavioural, and, fmri, studies, have, demonstrated, development, of, executive, functions, that, is, cognitive, skills, that, enable, the, control, and, coordination, of, thoughts, and, behaviour, which, are, generally, associated, with, the, prefrontal, cortex, the, thoughts, ideas, and, concepts, developed, at, this, period, of, life, greatly, influence, one, s, future, life, playing, a, major, role, in, character, and, personality, formation, biological, changes, in, brain, structure, and, connectivity, within, the, brain, interact, with, increased, experience, knowledge, and, changing, social, demands, to, produce, rapid, cognitive, growth, see, changes, in, the, brain, above, the, age, at, which, particular, changes, take, place, varies, between, individuals, but, the, changes, discussed, below, begin, at, puberty, or, shortly, after, that, and, some, skills, continue, to, develop, as, the, adolescent, ages, the, dual, systems, model, proposes, a, maturational, imbalance, between, development, of, the, socioemotional, system, and, cognitive, control, systems, in, the, brain, that, contribute, to, impulsivity, and, other, behaviors, characteristic, of, adolescence, some, studies, like, the, abcd, study, are, researching, on, the, baseline, of, adolescent, cognitive, development, there, are, at, least, two, major, approaches, to, understanding, cognitive, change, during, adolescence, one, is, the, constructivist, view, of, cognitive, development, based, on, the, work, of, piaget, it, takes, a, quantitative, state, theory, approach, hypothesizing, that, adolescents, cognitive, improvement, is, relatively, sudden, and, drastic, the, second, is, the, information, processing, perspective, which, derives, from, the, study, of, artificial, intelligence, and, attempts, to, explain, cognitive, development, in, terms, of, the, growth, of, specific, components, of, the, thinking, process, by, the, time, individuals, have, reached, ages, 12, 14, or, so, their, critical, thinking, and, decision, making, competency, are, comparable, to, those, of, adults, these, improvements, occur, in, five, areas, during, adolescence, studies, newer, than, 2005, indicate, that, the, brain, is, changing, in, efficiency, well, past, its, twenties, a, point, of, maturity, in, the, twenties, is, somewhat, arbitrary, as, many, important, parts, of, the, brain, are, noted, to, be, mature, by, 14, or, 15, making, maturity, hard, to, define, and, has, often, been, disagreed, with, prefrontal, cortex, pruning, has, been, recorded, to, level, off, by, age, 14, or, 15, and, has, been, seen, to, continue, as, late, as, into, the, sixth, decade, of, life, white, matter, is, recorded, to, increase, up, until, around, the, age, of, 45, and, then, it, is, lost, via, progressive, aging, if, myelination, continues, into, one, s, forties, and, fifties, shedding, doubt, on, the, claim, that, the, brain, completes, its, development, in, the, twenties, adolescents, thinking, is, less, bound, to, concrete, events, than, that, of, children, they, can, contemplate, possibilities, outside, the, realm, of, what, currently, exists, one, manifestation, of, the, adolescent, s, increased, facility, with, thinking, about, possibilities, is, the, improvement, of, skill, in, deductive, reasoning, which, leads, to, the, development, of, hypothetical, thinking, this, provides, the, ability, to, plan, ahead, see, the, future, consequences, of, an, action, and, to, provide, alternative, explanations, of, events, it, also, makes, adolescents, more, skilled, debaters, as, they, can, reason, against, a, friend, s, or, parent, s, assumptions, adolescents, also, develop, a, more, sophisticated, understanding, of, probability, the, appearance, of, more, systematic, abstract, thinking, is, another, notable, aspect, of, cognitive, development, during, adolescence, for, example, adolescents, find, it, easier, than, children, to, comprehend, the, sorts, of, higher, order, abstract, logic, inherent, in, puns, proverbs, metaphors, and, analogies, their, increased, facility, permits, them, to, appreciate, the, ways, in, which, language, can, be, used, to, convey, multiple, messages, such, as, satire, metaphor, and, sarcasm, children, younger, than, age, nine, often, cannot, comprehend, sarcasm, at, all, this, also, permits, the, application, of, advanced, reasoning, and, logical, processes, to, social, and, ideological, matters, such, as, interpersonal, relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and, honesty, a, third, gain, in, cognitive, ability, involves, thinking, about, thinking, itself, a, process, referred, to, as, metacognition, it, often, involves, monitoring, one, s, own, cognitive, activity, during, the, thinking, process, adolescents, improvements, in, knowledge, of, their, own, thinking, patterns, lead, to, better, self, control, and, more, effective, studying, it, is, also, relevant, in, social, cognition, resulting, in, increased, introspection, self, consciousness, and, intellectualization, in, the, sense, of, thought, about, one, s, own, thoughts, rather, than, the, freudian, definition, as, a, defense, mechanism, adolescents, are, much, better, able, than, children, to, understand, that, people, do, not, have, complete, control, over, their, mental, activity, being, able, to, introspect, may, lead, to, two, forms, of, adolescent, egocentrism, which, results, in, two, distinct, problems, in, thinking, the, imaginary, audience, and, the, personal, fable, these, likely, peak, at, age, fifteen, along, with, self, consciousness, in, general, related, to, metacognition, and, abstract, thought, perspective, taking, involves, a, more, sophisticated, theory, of, mind, adolescents, reach, a, stage, of, social, perspective, taking, in, which, they, can, understand, how, the, thoughts, or, actions, of, one, person, can, influence, those, of, another, person, even, if, they, personally, are, not, involved, compared, to, children, adolescents, are, more, likely, to, question, others, assertions, and, less, likely, to, accept, facts, as, absolute, truths, through, experience, outside, the, family, circle, they, learn, that, rules, they, were, taught, as, absolute, are, in, fact, relativistic, they, begin, to, differentiate, between, rules, instituted, out, of, common, sense, not, touching, a, hot, stove, and, those, that, are, based, on, culturally, relative, standards, codes, of, etiquette, not, dating, until, a, certain, age, a, delineation, that, younger, children, do, not, make, this, can, lead, to, a, period, of, questioning, authority, in, all, domains, because, most, injuries, sustained, by, adolescents, are, related, to, risky, behavior, alcohol, consumption, and, drug, use, reckless, or, distracted, driving, unprotected, sex, a, great, deal, of, research, has, been, done, on, the, cognitive, and, emotional, processes, underlying, adolescent, risk, taking, in, addressing, this, question, it, is, important, to, distinguish, whether, adolescents, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, risky, behaviors, prevalence, whether, they, make, risk, related, decisions, similarly, or, differently, than, adults, cognitive, processing, perspective, or, whether, they, use, the, same, processes, but, value, different, things, and, thus, arrive, at, different, conclusions, the, behavioral, decision, making, theory, proposes, that, adolescents, and, adults, both, weigh, the, potential, rewards, and, consequences, of, an, action, however, research, has, shown, that, adolescents, seem, to, give, more, weight, to, rewards, particularly, social, rewards, than, do, adults, research, seems, to, favor, the, hypothesis, that, adolescents, and, adults, think, about, risk, in, similar, ways, but, hold, different, values, and, thus, come, to, different, conclusions, some, have, argued, that, there, may, be, evolutionary, benefits, to, an, increased, propensity, for, risk, taking, in, adolescence, for, example, without, a, willingness, to, take, risks, teenagers, would, not, have, the, motivation, or, confidence, necessary, to, leave, their, family, of, origin, in, addition, from, a, population, perspective, there, is, an, advantage, to, having, a, group, of, individuals, willing, to, take, more, risks, and, try, new, methods, counterbalancing, the, more, conservative, elements, more, typical, of, the, received, knowledge, held, by, older, adults, risk, taking, may, also, have, reproductive, advantages, adolescents, have, a, newfound, priority, in, sexual, attraction, and, dating, and, risk, taking, is, required, to, impress, potential, mates, research, also, indicates, that, baseline, sensation, seeking, may, affect, risk, taking, behavior, throughout, the, lifespan, given, the, potential, consequences, engaging, in, sexual, behavior, is, somewhat, risky, particularly, for, adolescents, having, unprotected, sex, using, poor, birth, control, methods, e, g, withdrawal, having, multiple, sexual, partners, and, poor, communication, are, some, aspects, of, sexual, behavior, that, increase, individual, and, or, social, risk, aspects, of, adolescents, lives, that, are, correlated, with, risky, sexual, behavior, include, higher, rates, of, parental, abuse, and, lower, rates, of, parental, support, and, monitoring, related, to, their, increased, tendency, for, risk, taking, adolescents, show, impaired, behavioral, inhibition, including, deficits, in, extinction, learning, this, has, important, implications, for, engaging, in, risky, behavior, such, as, unsafe, sex, or, illicit, drug, use, as, adolescents, are, less, likely, to, inhibit, actions, that, may, have, negative, outcomes, in, the, future, this, phenomenon, also, has, consequences, for, behavioral, treatments, based, on, the, principle, of, extinction, such, as, cue, exposure, therapy, for, anxiety, or, drug, addiction, it, has, been, suggested, that, impaired, inhibition, specifically, extinction, may, help, to, explain, adolescent, propensity, to, relapse, to, drug, seeking, even, following, behavioral, treatment, for, addiction, the, formal, study, of, adolescent, psychology, began, with, the, publication, of, g, stanley, hall, s, adolescence, in, 1904, hall, who, was, the, first, president, of, the, american, psychological, association, defined, adolescence, to, be, the, period, of, life, from, ages, 14, to, 24, and, viewed, it, primarily, as, a, time, of, internal, turmoil, and, upheaval, sturm, und, drang, this, understanding, of, youth, was, based, on, two, then, new, ways, of, understanding, human, behavior, darwin, s, evolutionary, theory, and, freud, s, psychodynamic, theory, he, believed, that, adolescence, was, a, representation, of, our, human, ancestors, phylogenetic, shift, from, being, primitive, to, being, civilized, hall, s, assertions, stood, relatively, uncontested, until, the, 1950s, when, psychologists, such, as, erik, erikson, and, anna, freud, started, to, formulate, their, theories, about, adolescence, freud, believed, that, the, psychological, disturbances, associated, with, youth, were, biologically, based, and, culturally, universal, while, erikson, focused, on, the, dichotomy, between, identity, formation, and, role, fulfillment, even, with, their, different, theories, these, three, psychologists, agreed, that, adolescence, was, inherently, a, time, of, disturbance, and, psychological, confusion, the, less, turbulent, aspects, of, adolescence, such, as, peer, relations, and, cultural, influence, were, left, largely, ignored, until, the, 1980s, from, the, 50s, until, the, 80s, the, focus, of, the, field, was, mainly, on, describing, patterns, of, behavior, as, opposed, to, explaining, them, jean, macfarlane, founded, the, university, of, california, berkeley, s, institute, of, human, development, formerly, called, the, institute, of, child, welfare, in, 1927, the, institute, was, instrumental, in, initiating, studies, of, healthy, development, in, contrast, to, previous, work, that, had, been, dominated, by, theories, based, on, pathological, personalities, the, studies, looked, at, human, development, during, the, great, depression, and, world, war, ii, unique, historical, circumstances, under, which, a, generation, of, children, grew, up, the, oakland, growth, study, initiated, by, harold, jones, and, herbert, stolz, in, 1931, aimed, to, study, the, physical, intellectual, and, social, development, of, children, in, the, oakland, area, data, collection, began, in, 1932, and, continued, until, 1981, allowing, the, researchers, to, gather, longitudinal, data, on, the, individuals, that, extended, past, adolescence, into, adulthood, jean, macfarlane, launched, the, berkeley, guidance, study, which, examined, the, development, of, children, in, terms, of, their, socioeconomic, and, family, backgrounds, these, studies, provided, the, background, for, glen, elder, in, the, 1960s, to, propose, a, life, course, perspective, of, adolescent, development, elder, formulated, several, descriptive, principles, of, adolescent, development, the, principle, of, historical, time, and, place, states, that, an, individual, s, development, is, shaped, by, the, period, and, location, in, which, they, grow, up, the, principle, of, the, importance, of, timing, in, one, s, life, refers, to, the, different, impact, that, life, events, have, on, development, based, on, when, in, one, s, life, they, occur, the, idea, of, linked, lives, states, that, one, s, development, is, shaped, by, the, interconnected, network, of, relationships, of, which, one, is, a, part, and, the, principle, of, human, agency, asserts, that, one, s, life, course, is, constructed, via, the, choices, and, actions, of, an, individual, within, the, context, of, their, historical, period, and, social, network, in, 1984, the, society, for, research, on, adolescence, sra, became, the, first, official, organization, dedicated, to, the, study, of, adolescent, psychology, some, of, the, issues, first, addressed, by, this, group, include, the, nature, versus, nurture, debate, as, it, pertains, to, adolescence, understanding, the, interactions, between, adolescents, and, their, environment, and, considering, culture, social, groups, and, historical, context, when, interpreting, adolescent, behavior, evolutionary, biologists, like, jeremy, griffith, have, drawn, parallels, between, adolescent, psychology, and, the, developmental, evolution, of, modern, humans, from, hominid, ancestors, as, a, manifestation, of, ontogeny, recapitulating, phylogeny, identity, development, is, a, stage, in, the, adolescent, life, cycle, for, most, the, search, for, identity, begins, in, the, adolescent, years, during, these, years, adolescents, are, more, open, to, trying, on, different, behaviours, and, appearances, to, discover, who, they, are, in, an, attempt, to, find, their, identity, and, discover, who, they, are, adolescents, are, likely, to, cycle, through, a, number, of, identities, to, find, one, that, suits, them, best, developing, and, maintaining, identity, in, adolescent, years, is, a, difficult, task, due, to, multiple, factors, such, as, family, life, environment, and, social, status, empirical, studies, suggest, that, this, process, might, be, more, accurately, described, as, identity, development, rather, than, formation, but, confirms, a, normative, process, of, change, in, both, content, and, structure, of, one, s, thoughts, about, the, self, the, two, main, aspects, of, identity, development, are, self, clarity, and, self, esteem, since, choices, made, during, adolescent, years, can, influence, later, life, high, levels, of, self, awareness, and, self, control, during, mid, adolescence, will, lead, to, better, decisions, during, the, transition, to, adulthood, researchers, have, used, three, general, approaches, to, understanding, identity, development, self, concept, sense, of, identity, and, self, esteem, the, years, of, adolescence, create, a, more, conscientious, group, of, young, adults, adolescents, pay, close, attention, and, give, more, time, and, effort, to, their, appearance, as, their, body, goes, through, changes, unlike, children, teens, put, forth, an, effort, to, look, presentable, 1991, the, environment, in, which, an, adolescent, grows, up, also, plays, an, important, role, in, their, identity, development, studies, done, by, the, american, psychological, association, have, shown, that, adolescents, with, a, less, privileged, upbringing, have, a, more, difficult, time, developing, their, identity, the, idea, of, self, concept, is, known, as, the, ability, of, a, person, to, have, opinions, and, beliefs, that, are, defined, confidently, consistent, and, stable, early, in, adolescence, cognitive, developments, result, in, greater, self, awareness, greater, awareness, of, others, and, their, thoughts, and, judgments, the, ability, to, think, about, abstract, future, possibilities, and, the, ability, to, consider, multiple, possibilities, at, once, as, a, result, adolescents, experience, a, significant, shift, from, the, simple, concrete, and, global, self, descriptions, typical, of, young, children, as, children, they, defined, themselves, by, physical, traits, whereas, adolescents, define, themselves, based, on, their, values, thoughts, and, opinions, adolescents, can, conceptualize, multiple, possible, selves, that, they, could, become, and, long, term, possibilities, and, consequences, of, their, choices, exploring, these, possibilities, may, result, in, abrupt, changes, in, self, presentation, as, the, adolescent, chooses, or, rejects, qualities, and, behaviors, trying, to, guide, the, actual, self, toward, the, ideal, self, who, the, adolescent, wishes, to, be, and, away, from, the, feared, self, who, the, adolescent, does, not, want, to, be, for, many, these, distinctions, are, uncomfortable, but, they, also, appear, to, motivate, achievement, through, behavior, consistent, with, the, ideal, and, distinct, from, the, feared, possible, selves, further, distinctions, in, self, concept, called, differentiation, occur, as, the, adolescent, recognizes, the, contextual, influences, on, their, own, behavior, and, the, perceptions, of, others, and, begin, to, qualify, their, traits, when, asked, to, describe, themselves, differentiation, appears, fully, developed, by, mid, adolescence, peaking, in, the, 7th, 9th, grades, the, personality, traits, adolescents, use, to, describe, themselves, refer, to, specific, contexts, and, therefore, may, contradict, one, another, the, recognition, of, inconsistent, content, in, the, self, concept, is, a, common, source, of, distress, in, these, years, see, cognitive, dissonance, but, this, distress, may, benefit, adolescents, by, encouraging, structural, development, egocentrism, in, adolescents, forms, a, self, conscious, desire, to, feel, important, in, their, peer, groups, and, enjoy, social, acceptance, unlike, the, conflicting, aspects, of, self, concept, identity, represents, a, coherent, sense, of, self, stable, across, circumstances, and, including, past, experiences, and, future, goals, everyone, has, a, self, concept, whereas, erik, erikson, argued, that, not, everyone, fully, achieves, identity, erikson, s, theory, of, stages, of, development, includes, the, identity, crisis, in, which, adolescents, must, explore, different, possibilities, and, integrate, different, parts, of, themselves, before, committing, to, their, beliefs, he, described, the, resolution, of, this, process, as, a, stage, of, identity, achievement, but, also, stressed, that, the, identity, challenge, is, never, fully, resolved, once, and, for, all, at, one, point, in, time, adolescents, begin, by, defining, themselves, based, on, their, crowd, membership, clothes, help, teens, explore, new, identities, separate, from, parents, and, bond, with, peers, fashion, has, played, a, major, role, when, it, comes, to, teenagers, finding, their, selves, fashion, is, always, evolving, which, corresponds, with, the, evolution, of, change, in, the, personality, of, teenagers, adolescents, attempt, to, define, their, identity, by, consciously, styling, themselves, in, different, manners, to, find, what, best, suits, them, trial, and, error, in, matching, both, their, perceived, image, and, the, image, others, respond, to, and, see, allows, for, the, adolescent, to, grasp, an, understanding, of, who, they, are, just, as, fashion, is, evolving, to, influence, adolescents, so, is, the, media, modern, life, takes, place, amidst, a, never, ending, barrage, of, flesh, on, screens, pages, and, billboards, this, barrage, consciously, or, subconsciously, registers, into, the, mind, causing, issues, with, self, image, a, factor, that, contributes, to, an, adolescence, sense, of, identity, researcher, james, marcia, developed, the, current, method, for, testing, an, individual, s, progress, along, these, stages, his, questions, are, divided, into, three, categories, occupation, ideology, and, interpersonal, relationships, answers, are, scored, based, on, the, extent, to, which, the, individual, has, explored, and, the, degree, to, which, he, has, made, commitments, the, result, is, classification, of, the, individual, into, a, identity, diffusion, in, which, all, children, begin, b, identity, foreclosure, in, which, commitments, are, made, without, the, exploration, of, alternatives, c, moratorium, or, the, process, of, exploration, or, d, identity, achievement, in, which, moratorium, has, occurred, and, resulted, in, commitments, research, since, reveals, self, examination, beginning, early, in, adolescence, but, identity, achievement, rarely, occurring, before, age, 18, the, freshman, year, of, college, influences, identity, development, significantly, but, may, actually, prolong, psychosocial, moratorium, by, encouraging, reexamination, of, previous, commitments, and, further, exploration, of, alternate, possibilities, without, encouraging, resolution, for, the, most, part, evidence, has, supported, erikson, s, stages, each, correlates, with, the, personality, traits, he, originally, predicted, studies, also, confirm, the, impermanence, of, the, stages, there, is, no, final, endpoint, in, identity, development, an, adolescent, s, environment, plays, a, huge, role, in, their, identity, development, while, most, adolescent, studies, are, conducted, on, white, middle, class, children, studies, show, that, the, more, privileged, upbringing, people, have, the, more, successfully, they, develop, their, identity, the, forming, of, an, adolescent, s, identity, is, a, crucial, time, in, their, life, it, has, been, recently, found, that, demographic, patterns, suggest, that, the, transition, to, adulthood, is, now, occurring, over, a, longer, span, of, years, than, was, the, case, during, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, accordingly, youth, a, period, that, spans, late, adolescence, and, early, adulthood, has, become, a, more, prominent, stage, of, the, life, course, this, therefore, has, caused, various, factors, to, become, important, during, this, development, so, many, factors, contribute, to, the, developing, social, identity, of, an, adolescent, from, commitment, to, coping, devices, to, social, media, all, of, these, factors, are, affected, by, the, environment, an, adolescent, grows, up, in, a, child, from, a, more, privileged, upbringing, is, exposed, to, more, opportunities, and, better, situations, in, general, an, adolescent, from, an, inner, city, or, a, crime, driven, neighborhood, is, more, likely, to, be, exposed, to, an, environment, that, can, be, detrimental, to, their, development, adolescence, is, a, sensitive, period, in, the, development, process, and, exposure, to, the, wrong, things, at, that, time, can, have, a, major, effect, on, future, decisions, while, children, that, grow, up, in, nice, suburban, communities, are, not, exposed, to, bad, environments, they, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, activities, that, can, benefit, their, identity, and, contribute, to, a, more, successful, identity, development, sexual, orientation, has, been, defined, as, an, erotic, inclination, toward, people, of, one, or, more, genders, most, often, described, as, sexual, or, erotic, attractions, in, recent, years, psychologists, have, sought, to, understand, how, sexual, orientation, develops, during, adolescence, some, theorists, believe, that, there, are, many, different, possible, developmental, paths, one, could, take, and, that, the, specific, path, an, individual, follows, may, be, determined, by, their, sex, orientation, and, when, they, reached, the, onset, of, puberty, in, 1989, troiden, proposed, a, four, stage, model, for, the, development, of, homosexual, sexual, identity, the, first, stage, known, as, sensitization, usually, starts, in, childhood, and, is, marked, by, the, child, s, becoming, aware, of, same, sex, attractions, the, second, stage, identity, confusion, tends, to, occur, a, few, years, later, in, this, stage, the, youth, is, overwhelmed, by, feelings, of, inner, turmoil, regarding, their, sexual, orientation, and, begins, to, engage, in, sexual, experiences, with, same, sex, partners, in, the, third, stage, of, identity, assumption, which, usually, takes, place, a, few, years, after, the, adolescent, has, left, home, adolescents, begin, to, come, out, to, their, family, and, close, friends, and, assumes, a, self, definition, as, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, in, the, final, stage, known, as, commitment, the, young, adult, adopts, their, sexual, identity, as, a, lifestyle, therefore, this, model, estimates, that, the, process, of, coming, out, begins, in, childhood, and, continues, through, the, early, to, mid, 20s, this, model, has, been, contested, and, alternate, ideas, have, been, explored, in, recent, years, in, terms, of, sexual, identity, adolescence, is, when, most, gay, lesbian, and, transgender, adolescents, begin, to, recognize, and, make, sense, of, their, feelings, many, adolescents, may, choose, to, come, out, during, this, period, of, their, life, once, an, identity, has, been, formed, many, others, may, go, through, a, period, of, questioning, or, denial, which, can, include, experimentation, with, both, homosexual, and, heterosexual, experiences, a, study, of, 194, lesbian, gay, and, bisexual, youths, under, the, age, of, 21, found, that, having, an, awareness, of, one, s, sexual, orientation, occurred, on, average, around, age, 10, but, the, process, of, coming, out, to, peers, and, adults, occurred, around, age, 16, and, 17, respectively, coming, to, terms, with, and, creating, a, positive, lgbt, identity, can, be, difficult, for, some, youth, for, a, variety, of, reasons, peer, pressure, is, a, large, factor, when, youth, who, are, questioning, their, sexuality, or, gender, identity, are, surrounded, by, heteronormative, peers, and, can, cause, great, distress, due, to, a, feeling, of, being, different, from, everyone, else, while, coming, out, can, also, foster, better, psychological, adjustment, the, risks, associated, are, real, indeed, coming, out, in, the, midst, of, a, heteronormative, peer, environment, often, comes, with, the, risk, of, ostracism, hurtful, jokes, and, even, violence, because, of, this, statistically, the, suicide, rate, amongst, lgbt, adolescents, is, up, to, four, times, higher, than, that, of, their, heterosexual, peers, due, to, bullying, and, rejection, from, peers, or, family, members, the, final, major, aspect, of, identity, formation, is, self, esteem, self, esteem, is, defined, as, one, s, thoughts, and, feelings, about, one, s, self, concept, and, identity, most, theories, on, self, esteem, state, that, there, is, a, grand, desire, across, all, genders, and, ages, to, maintain, protect, and, enhance, their, self, esteem, contrary, to, popular, belief, there, is, no, empirical, evidence, for, a, significant, drop, in, self, esteem, over, the, course, of, adolescence, barometric, self, esteem, fluctuates, rapidly, and, can, cause, severe, distress, and, anxiety, but, baseline, self, esteem, remains, highly, stable, across, adolescence, the, validity, of, global, self, esteem, scales, has, been, questioned, and, many, suggest, that, more, specific, scales, might, reveal, more, about, the, adolescent, experience, girls, are, most, likely, to, enjoy, high, self, esteem, when, engaged, in, supportive, relationships, with, friends, the, most, important, function, of, friendship, to, them, is, having, someone, who, can, provide, social, and, moral, support, girls, suffer, from, low, self, esteem, when, they, fail, to, win, friends, approval, or, cannot, find, someone, with, whom, to, share, common, activities, and, common, interests, in, contrast, boys, are, more, concerned, with, establishing, and, asserting, their, independence, and, defining, their, relation, to, authority, as, such, they, are, more, likely, to, derive, high, self, esteem, from, their, ability, to, successfully, influence, their, friends, on, the, other, hand, the, lack, of, romantic, competence, for, example, failure, to, win, or, maintain, the, affection, of, the, opposite, or, same, sex, depending, on, sexual, orientation, is, the, major, contributor, to, low, self, esteem, in, adolescent, boys, due, to, the, fact, that, both, men, and, women, happen, to, have, a, low, self, esteem, after, ending, a, romantic, relationship, they, are, prone, to, other, symptoms, that, is, caused, by, this, state, depression, and, hopelessness, are, only, two, of, the, various, symptoms, and, it, is, said, that, women, are, twice, as, likely, to, experience, depression, and, men, are, three, to, four, times, more, likely, to, commit, suicide, mearns, 1991, ustun, sartorius, 1995, the, relationships, adolescents, have, with, their, peers, family, and, members, of, their, social, sphere, play, a, vital, role, in, the, social, development, of, an, adolescent, as, an, adolescent, s, social, sphere, develops, rapidly, as, they, distinguish, the, differences, between, friends, and, acquaintances, they, often, become, heavily, emotionally, invested, in, friends, this, is, not, harmful, however, if, these, friends, expose, an, individual, to, potentially, harmful, situations, this, is, an, aspect, of, peer, pressure, adolescence, is, a, critical, period, in, social, development, because, adolescents, can, be, easily, influenced, by, the, people, they, develop, close, relationships, with, this, is, the, first, time, individuals, can, truly, make, their, own, decisions, which, also, makes, this, a, sensitive, period, relationships, are, vital, in, the, social, development, of, an, adolescent, due, to, the, extreme, influence, peers, can, have, over, an, individual, these, relationships, become, significant, because, they, begin, to, help, the, adolescent, understand, the, concept, of, personalities, how, they, form, and, why, a, person, has, that, specific, type, of, personality, the, use, of, psychological, comparisons, could, serve, both, as, an, index, of, the, growth, of, an, implicit, personality, theory, and, as, a, component, process, accounting, for, its, creation, in, other, words, by, comparing, one, person, s, personality, characteristics, to, another, s, we, would, be, setting, up, the, framework, for, creating, a, general, theory, of, personality, and, such, a, theory, would, serve, as, a, useful, framework, for, coming, to, understand, specific, persons, this, can, be, likened, to, the, use, of, social, comparison, in, developing, one, s, identity, and, self, concept, which, includes, ones, personality, and, underscores, the, importance, of, communication, and, thus, relationships, in, one, s, development, in, social, comparison, we, use, reference, groups, with, respect, to, both, psychological, and, identity, development, these, reference, groups, are, the, peers, of, adolescents, this, means, that, who, the, teen, chooses, accepts, as, their, friends, and, who, they, communicate, with, on, a, frequent, basis, often, makes, up, their, reference, groups, and, can, therefore, have, a, huge, impact, on, who, they, become, research, shows, that, relationships, have, the, largest, affect, over, the, social, development, of, an, individual, adolescence, marks, a, rapid, change, in, one, s, role, within, a, family, young, children, tend, to, assert, themselves, forcefully, but, are, unable, to, demonstrate, much, influence, over, family, decisions, until, early, adolescence, when, they, are, increasingly, viewed, by, parents, as, equals, the, adolescent, faces, the, task, of, increasing, independence, while, preserving, a, caring, relationship, with, his, or, her, parents, when, children, go, through, puberty, there, is, often, a, significant, increase, in, parent, child, conflict, and, a, less, cohesive, familial, bond, arguments, often, concern, minor, issues, of, control, such, as, curfew, acceptable, clothing, and, the, adolescent, s, right, to, privacy, which, adolescents, may, have, previously, viewed, as, issues, over, which, their, parents, had, complete, authority, parent, adolescent, disagreement, also, increases, as, friends, demonstrate, a, greater, impact, on, one, another, new, influences, on, the, adolescent, that, may, be, in, opposition, to, parents, values, social, media, has, also, played, an, increasing, role, in, adolescent, and, parent, disagreements, while, parents, never, had, to, worry, about, the, threats, of, social, media, in, the, past, it, has, become, a, dangerous, place, for, children, while, adolescents, strive, for, their, freedoms, the, unknowns, to, parents, of, what, their, child, is, doing, on, social, media, sites, is, a, challenging, subject, due, to, the, increasing, amount, of, predators, on, social, media, sites, many, parents, have, very, little, knowledge, of, social, networking, sites, in, the, first, place, and, this, further, increases, their, mistrust, an, important, challenge, for, the, parent, adolescent, relationship, is, to, understand, how, to, enhance, the, opportunities, of, online, communication, while, managing, its, risks, although, conflicts, between, children, and, parents, increase, during, adolescence, these, are, just, relatively, minor, issues, regarding, their, important, life, issues, most, adolescents, still, share, the, same, attitudes, and, values, as, their, parents, during, childhood, siblings, are, a, source, of, conflict, and, frustration, as, well, as, a, support, system, adolescence, may, affect, this, relationship, differently, depending, on, sibling, gender, in, same, sex, sibling, pairs, intimacy, increases, during, early, adolescence, then, remains, stable, mixed, sex, siblings, pairs, act, differently, siblings, drift, apart, during, early, adolescent, years, but, experience, an, increase, in, intimacy, starting, at, middle, adolescence, sibling, interactions, are, children, s, first, relational, experiences, the, ones, that, shape, their, social, and, self, understanding, for, life, sustaining, positive, sibling, relations, can, assist, adolescents, in, a, number, of, ways, siblings, are, able, to, act, as, peers, and, may, increase, one, another, s, sociability, and, feelings, of, self, worth, older, siblings, can, give, guidance, to, younger, siblings, although, the, impact, of, this, can, be, either, positive, or, negative, depending, on, the, activity, of, the, older, sibling, a, potential, important, influence, on, adolescence, is, change, of, the, family, dynamic, specifically, divorce, with, the, divorce, rate, up, to, about, 50, divorce, is, common, and, adds, to, the, already, great, amount, of, change, in, adolescence, custody, disputes, soon, after, a, divorce, often, reflect, a, playing, out, of, control, battles, and, ambivalence, between, parents, divorce, usually, results, in, less, contact, between, the, adolescent, and, their, noncustodial, parent, in, extreme, cases, of, instability, and, abuse, in, homes, divorce, can, have, a, positive, effect, on, families, due, to, less, conflict, in, the, home, however, most, research, suggests, a, negative, effect, on, adolescence, as, well, as, later, development, a, recent, study, found, that, compared, with, peers, who, grow, up, in, stable, post, divorce, families, children, of, divorce, who, experience, additional, family, transitions, during, late, adolescence, make, less, progress, in, their, math, and, social, studies, performance, over, time, another, recent, study, put, forth, a, new, theory, entitled, the, adolescent, epistemological, trauma, theory, which, posited, that, traumatic, life, events, such, as, parental, divorce, during, the, formative, period, of, late, adolescence, portend, lifelong, effects, on, adult, conflict, behavior, that, can, be, mitigated, by, effective, behavioral, assessment, and, training, a, parental, divorce, during, childhood, or, adolescence, continues, to, have, a, negative, effect, when, a, person, is, in, his, or, her, twenties, and, early, thirties, these, negative, effects, include, romantic, relationships, and, conflict, style, meaning, as, adults, they, are, more, likely, to, use, the, styles, of, avoidance, and, competing, in, conflict, management, despite, changing, family, roles, during, adolescence, the, home, environment, and, parents, are, still, important, for, the, behaviors, and, choices, of, adolescents, adolescents, who, have, a, good, relationship, with, their, parents, are, less, likely, to, engage, in, various, risk, behaviors, such, as, smoking, drinking, fighting, and, or, unprotected, sexual, intercourse, in, addition, parents, influence, the, education, of, adolescence, a, study, conducted, by, adalbjarnardottir, and, blondal, 2009, showed, that, adolescents, at, the, age, of, 14, who, identify, their, parents, as, authoritative, figures, are, more, likely, to, complete, secondary, education, by, the, age, of, 22, as, support, and, encouragement, from, an, authoritative, parent, motivates, the, adolescence, to, complete, schooling, to, avoid, disappointing, that, parent, peer, groups, are, essential, to, social, and, general, development, communication, with, peers, increases, significantly, during, adolescence, and, peer, relationships, become, more, intense, than, in, other, stages, and, more, influential, to, the, teen, affecting, both, the, decisions, and, choices, being, made, high, quality, friendships, may, enhance, children, s, development, regardless, of, the, characteristics, of, those, friends, as, children, begin, to, bond, with, various, people, and, create, friendships, it, later, helps, them, when, they, are, adolescent, and, sets, up, the, framework, for, adolescence, and, peer, groups, peer, groups, are, especially, important, during, adolescence, a, period, of, development, characterized, by, a, dramatic, increase, in, time, spent, with, peers, and, a, decrease, in, adult, supervision, adolescents, also, associate, with, friends, of, the, opposite, sex, much, more, than, in, childhood, and, tend, to, identify, with, larger, groups, of, peers, based, on, shared, characteristics, it, is, also, common, for, adolescents, to, use, friends, as, coping, devices, in, different, situations, a, three, factor, structure, of, dealing, with, friends, including, avoidance, mastery, and, nonchalance, has, shown, that, adolescents, use, friends, as, coping, devices, with, social, stresses, communication, within, peer, groups, allows, adolescents, to, explore, their, feelings, and, identity, as, well, as, develop, and, evaluate, their, social, skills, peer, groups, offer, members, the, opportunity, to, develop, social, skills, such, as, empathy, sharing, and, leadership, adolescents, choose, peer, groups, based, on, characteristics, similarly, found, in, themselves, by, utilizing, these, relationships, adolescents, become, more, accepting, of, who, they, are, becoming, group, norms, and, values, are, incorporated, into, an, adolescent, s, own, self, concept, through, developing, new, communication, skills, and, reflecting, upon, those, of, their, peers, as, well, as, self, opinions, and, values, an, adolescent, can, share, and, express, emotions, and, other, concerns, without, fear, of, rejection, or, judgment, peer, groups, can, have, positive, influences, on, an, individual, such, as, on, academic, motivation, and, performance, however, while, peers, may, facilitate, social, development, for, one, another, they, may, also, hinder, it, peers, can, have, negative, influences, such, as, encouraging, experimentation, with, drugs, drinking, vandalism, and, stealing, through, peer, pressure, susceptibility, to, peer, pressure, increases, during, early, adolescence, peaks, around, age, 14, and, declines, thereafter, further, evidence, of, peers, hindering, social, development, has, been, found, in, spanish, teenagers, where, emotional, rather, than, solution, based, reactions, to, problems, and, emotional, instability, have, been, linked, with, physical, aggression, against, peers, both, physical, and, relational, aggression, are, linked, to, a, vast, number, of, enduring, psychological, difficulties, especially, depression, as, is, social, rejection, because, of, this, bullied, adolescents, often, develop, problems, that, lead, to, further, victimization, bullied, adolescents, are, more, likely, to, both, continue, to, be, bullied, and, to, bully, others, in, the, future, however, this, relationship, is, less, stable, in, cases, of, cyberbullying, a, relatively, new, issue, among, adolescents, adolescents, tend, to, associate, with, cliques, on, a, small, scale, and, crowds, on, a, larger, scale, during, early, adolescence, adolescents, often, associate, in, cliques, exclusive, single, sex, groups, of, peers, with, whom, they, are, particularly, close, despite, the, common, notion, that, cliques, are, an, inherently, negative, influence, they, may, help, adolescents, become, socially, acclimated, and, form, a, stronger, sense, of, identity, within, a, clique, of, highly, athletic, male, peers, for, example, the, clique, may, create, a, stronger, sense, of, fidelity, and, competition, cliques, also, have, become, somewhat, a, collective, parent, i, e, telling, the, adolescents, what, to, do, and, not, to, do, towards, late, adolescence, cliques, often, merge, into, mixed, sex, groups, as, teenagers, begin, romantically, engaging, with, one, another, these, small, friend, groups, then, break, down, further, as, socialization, becomes, more, couple, oriented, on, a, larger, scale, adolescents, often, associate, with, crowds, groups, of, individuals, who, share, a, common, interest, or, activity, often, crowd, identities, may, be, the, basis, for, stereotyping, young, people, such, as, jocks, or, nerds, in, large, multi, ethnic, high, schools, there, are, often, ethnically, determined, crowds, adolescents, use, online, technology, to, experiment, with, emerging, identities, and, to, broaden, their, peer, groups, such, as, increasing, the, amount, of, friends, acquired, on, facebook, and, other, social, media, sites, some, adolescents, use, these, newer, channels, to, enhance, relationships, with, peers, however, there, can, be, negative, uses, as, well, such, as, cyberbullying, as, mentioned, previously, and, negative, impacts, on, the, family, romantic, relationships, tend, to, increase, in, prevalence, throughout, adolescence, by, age, 15, 53, of, adolescents, have, had, a, romantic, relationship, that, lasted, at, least, one, month, over, the, course, of, the, previous, 18, months, in, a, 2008, study, conducted, by, yougov, for, channel, 4, 20, of, 14, 17, year, olds, surveyed, revealed, that, they, had, their, first, sexual, experience, at, 13, or, under, in, the, united, kingdom, a, 2002, american, study, found, that, those, aged, 15, 44, reported, that, the, average, age, of, first, sexual, intercourse, was, 17, 0, for, males, and, 17, 3, for, females, the, typical, duration, of, relationships, increases, throughout, the, teenage, years, as, well, this, constant, increase, in, the, likelihood, of, a, long, term, relationship, can, be, explained, by, sexual, maturation, and, the, development, of, cognitive, skills, necessary, to, maintain, a, romantic, bond, e, g, caregiving, appropriate, attachment, although, these, skills, are, not, strongly, developed, until, late, adolescence, long, term, relationships, allow, adolescents, to, gain, the, skills, necessary, for, high, quality, relationships, later, in, life, and, develop, feelings, of, self, worth, overall, positive, romantic, relationships, among, adolescents, can, result, in, long, term, benefits, high, quality, romantic, relationships, are, associated, with, higher, commitment, in, early, adulthood, and, are, positively, associated, with, self, esteem, self, confidence, and, social, competence, for, example, an, adolescent, with, positive, self, confidence, is, likely, to, consider, themselves, a, more, successful, partner, whereas, negative, experiences, may, lead, to, low, confidence, as, a, romantic, partner, adolescents, often, date, within, their, demographic, in, regards, to, race, ethnicity, popularity, and, physical, attractiveness, however, there, are, traits, in, which, certain, individuals, particularly, adolescent, girls, seek, diversity, while, most, adolescents, date, people, approximately, their, own, age, boys, typically, date, partners, the, same, age, or, younger, girls, typically, date, partners, the, same, age, or, older, some, researchers, are, now, focusing, on, learning, about, how, adolescents, view, their, own, relationships, and, sexuality, they, want, to, move, away, from, a, research, point, of, view, that, focuses, on, the, problems, associated, with, adolescent, sexuality, college, professor, lucia, o, sullivan, and, her, colleagues, found, that, there, were, no, significant, gender, differences, in, the, relationship, events, adolescent, boys, and, girls, from, grades, 7, 12, reported, most, teens, said, they, had, kissed, their, partners, held, hands, with, them, thought, of, themselves, as, being, a, couple, and, told, people, they, were, in, a, relationship, this, means, that, private, thoughts, about, the, relationship, as, well, as, public, recognition, of, the, relationship, were, both, important, to, the, adolescents, in, the, sample, sexual, events, such, as, sexual, touching, sexual, intercourse, were, less, common, than, romantic, events, holding, hands, and, social, events, being, with, one, s, partner, in, a, group, setting, the, researchers, state, that, these, results, are, important, because, the, results, focus, on, the, more, positive, aspects, of, adolescents, and, their, social, and, romantic, interactions, rather, than, focusing, on, sexual, behavior, and, its, consequences, adolescence, marks, a, time, of, sexual, maturation, which, manifests, in, social, interactions, as, well, while, adolescents, may, engage, in, casual, sexual, encounters, often, referred, to, as, hookups, most, sexual, experience, during, this, period, of, development, takes, place, within, romantic, relationships, adolescents, can, use, technologies, and, social, media, to, seek, out, romantic, relationships, as, they, feel, it, is, a, safe, place, to, try, out, dating, and, identity, exploration, from, these, social, media, encounters, a, further, relationship, may, begin, kissing, hand, holding, and, hugging, signify, satisfaction, and, commitment, among, young, adolescents, heavy, sexual, activity, marked, by, genital, stimulation, is, often, associated, with, violence, depression, and, poor, relationship, quality, this, effect, does, not, hold, true, for, sexual, activity, in, late, adolescence, that, takes, place, within, a, romantic, relationship, some, research, suggest, that, there, are, genetic, causes, of, early, sexual, activity, that, are, also, risk, factors, for, delinquency, suggesting, that, there, is, a, group, who, are, at, risk, for, both, early, sexual, activity, and, emotional, distress, for, older, adolescents, though, sexual, activity, in, the, context, of, romantic, relationships, was, actually, correlated, with, lower, levels, of, deviant, behavior, after, controlling, for, genetic, risks, as, opposed, to, sex, outside, of, a, relationship, hook, ups, dating, violence, can, occur, within, adolescent, relationships, when, surveyed, 12, 25, of, adolescents, reported, having, experienced, physical, violence, in, the, context, of, a, relationship, while, a, quarter, to, a, third, of, adolescents, reported, having, experiencing, psychological, aggression, this, reported, aggression, includes, hitting, throwing, things, or, slaps, although, most, of, this, physical, aggression, does, not, result, in, a, medical, visit, physical, aggression, in, relationships, tends, to, decline, from, high, school, through, college, and, young, adulthood, in, heterosexual, couples, there, is, no, significant, difference, between, the, rates, of, male, and, female, aggressors, unlike, in, adult, relationships, female, adolescents, from, minority, populations, are, at, increased, risk, for, intimate, partner, violence, ipv, recent, research, findings, suggest, that, a, substantial, portion, of, young, urban, females, are, at, high, risk, for, being, victims, of, multiple, forms, of, ipv, practitioners, diagnosing, depression, among, urban, minority, teens, should, assess, for, both, physical, and, non, physical, forms, of, ipv, and, early, detection, can, help, to, identify, youths, in, need, of, intervention, and, care, similarly, to, adult, victims, adolescent, victims, do, not, readily, disclose, abuse, and, may, seek, out, medical, care, for, problems, not, directly, related, to, incidences, of, ipv, therefore, screening, should, be, a, routine, part, of, medical, treatment, for, adolescents, regardless, of, chief, complaint, many, adults, discount, instances, of, ipv, in, adolescents, or, believe, they, do, not, occur, because, relationships, at, young, ages, are, viewed, as, puppy, love, however, it, is, crucial, that, adults, take, ipv, in, adolescents, seriously, even, though, often, policy, falls, behind, in, contemporary, society, adolescents, also, face, some, risks, as, their, sexuality, begins, to, transform, while, some, of, these, such, as, emotional, distress, fear, of, abuse, or, exploitation, and, sexually, transmitted, infections, diseases, stis, stds, including, hiv, aids, are, not, necessarily, inherent, to, adolescence, others, such, as, teenage, pregnancy, through, non, use, or, failure, of, contraceptives, are, seen, as, social, problems, in, most, western, societies, one, in, four, sexually, active, teenagers, will, contract, an, sti, adolescents, in, the, united, states, often, chose, anything, but, intercourse, for, sexual, activity, because, they, mistakenly, believe, it, reduces, the, risk, of, stis, across, the, country, clinicians, report, rising, diagnoses, of, herpes, and, human, papillomavirus, hpv, which, can, cause, genital, warts, and, is, now, thought, to, affect, 15, percent, of, the, teen, population, girls, 15, to, 19, have, higher, rates, of, gonorrhea, than, any, other, age, group, one, quarter, of, all, new, hiv, cases, occur, in, those, under, the, age, of, 21, multrine, also, states, in, her, article, that, according, to, a, march, survey, by, the, kaiser, family, foundation, eighty, one, percent, of, parents, want, schools, to, discuss, the, use, of, condoms, and, contraception, with, their, children, they, also, believe, students, should, be, able, to, be, tested, for, stis, furthermore, teachers, want, to, address, such, topics, with, their, students, but, although, 9, in, 10, sex, education, instructors, across, the, country, believe, that, students, should, be, taught, about, contraceptives, in, school, over, one, quarter, report, receiving, explicit, instructions, from, school, boards, and, administrators, not, to, do, so, according, to, anthropologist, margaret, mead, the, turmoil, found, in, adolescence, in, western, society, has, a, cultural, rather, than, a, physical, cause, they, reported, that, societies, where, young, women, engaged, in, free, sexual, activity, had, no, such, adolescent, turmoil, there, are, certain, characteristics, of, adolescent, development, that, are, more, rooted, in, culture, than, in, human, biology, or, cognitive, structures, culture, has, been, defined, as, the, symbolic, and, behavioral, inheritance, received, from, the, past, that, provides, a, community, framework, for, what, is, valued, culture, is, learned, and, socially, shared, and, it, affects, all, aspects, of, an, individual, s, life, social, responsibilities, sexual, expression, and, belief, system, development, for, instance, are, all, things, that, are, likely, to, vary, by, culture, furthermore, distinguishing, characteristics, of, youth, including, dress, music, and, other, uses, of, media, employment, art, food, and, beverage, choices, recreation, and, language, all, constitute, a, youth, culture, for, these, reasons, culture, is, a, prevalent, and, powerful, presence, in, the, lives, of, adolescents, and, therefore, we, cannot, fully, understand, today, s, adolescents, without, studying, and, understanding, their, culture, however, culture, should, not, be, seen, as, synonymous, with, nation, or, ethnicity, many, cultures, are, present, within, any, given, country, and, racial, or, socioeconomic, group, furthermore, to, avoid, ethnocentrism, researchers, must, be, careful, not, to, define, the, culture, s, role, in, adolescence, in, terms, of, their, own, cultural, beliefs, in, his, short, book, the, teenage, consumer, published, in, july, 1959, the, british, market, research, pioneer, mark, abrams, identified, the, emergence, of, a, new, economic, group, of, people, aged, 13, 25, compared, to, children, people, in, this, age, range, had, more, money, more, discretion, on, how, they, chose, to, spend, it, and, greater, mobility, through, the, advent, of, the, motor, car, compared, to, adults, people, in, this, age, range, had, fewer, responsibilities, and, therefore, made, different, choices, on, how, to, spend, their, money, these, unique, characteristics, of, this, new, economic, group, presented, challenges, and, opportunities, to, advertisers, mark, abrams, coined, the, term, teenager, to, describe, this, group, of, consumers, aged, 13, 25, in, britain, teenagers, first, came, to, public, attention, during, the, second, world, war, when, there, were, fears, of, juvenile, delinquency, by, the, 1950s, the, media, presented, teenagers, in, terms, of, generational, rebellion, the, exaggerated, moral, panic, among, politicians, and, the, older, generation, was, typically, belied, by, the, growth, in, intergenerational, cooperation, between, parents, and, children, many, working, class, parents, enjoying, newfound, economic, security, eagerly, took, the, opportunity, to, encourage, their, teens, to, enjoy, more, adventurous, lives, schools, were, falsely, portrayed, as, dangerous, blackboard, jungles, under, the, control, of, rowdy, kids, the, media, distortions, of, the, teens, as, too, affluent, and, as, promiscuous, delinquent, counter, cultural, rebels, do, not, reflect, the, actual, experiences, of, ordinary, young, adults, particularly, young, women, the, degree, to, which, adolescents, are, perceived, as, autonomous, beings, varies, widely, by, culture, as, do, the, behaviors, that, represent, this, emerging, autonomy, psychologists, have, identified, three, main, types, of, autonomy, emotional, independence, behavioral, autonomy, and, cognitive, autonomy, emotional, autonomy, is, defined, in, terms, of, an, adolescent, s, relationships, with, others, and, often, includes, the, development, of, more, mature, emotional, connections, with, adults, and, peers, behavioral, autonomy, encompasses, an, adolescent, s, developing, ability, to, regulate, his, or, her, own, behavior, to, act, on, personal, decisions, and, to, self, govern, cultural, differences, are, especially, visible, in, this, category, because, it, concerns, issues, of, dating, social, time, with, peers, and, time, management, decisions, cognitive, autonomy, describes, the, capacity, for, an, adolescent, to, partake, in, processes, of, independent, reasoning, and, decision, making, without, excessive, reliance, on, social, validation, converging, influences, from, adolescent, cognitive, development, expanding, social, relationships, an, increasingly, adultlike, appearance, and, the, acceptance, of, more, rights, and, responsibilities, enhance, feelings, of, autonomy, for, adolescents, proper, development, of, autonomy, has, been, tied, to, good, mental, health, high, self, esteem, self, motivated, tendencies, positive, self, concepts, and, self, initiating, and, regulating, behaviors, furthermore, it, has, been, found, that, adolescents, mental, health, is, best, when, their, feelings, about, autonomy, match, closely, with, those, of, their, parents, a, questionnaire, called, the, teen, timetable, has, been, used, to, measure, the, age, at, which, individuals, believe, adolescents, should, be, able, to, engage, in, behaviors, associated, with, autonomy, this, questionnaire, has, been, used, to, gauge, differences, in, cultural, perceptions, of, adolescent, autonomy, finding, for, instance, that, white, parents, and, adolescents, tend, to, expect, autonomy, earlier, than, those, of, asian, descent, it, is, therefore, clear, that, cultural, differences, exist, in, perceptions, of, adolescent, autonomy, and, such, differences, have, implications, for, the, lifestyles, and, development, of, adolescents, in, sub, saharan, african, youth, the, notions, of, individuality, and, freedom, may, not, be, useful, in, understanding, adolescent, development, rather, african, notions, of, childhood, and, adolescent, development, are, relational, and, interdependent, the, lifestyle, of, an, adolescent, in, a, given, culture, is, profoundly, shaped, by, the, roles, and, responsibilities, he, or, she, is, expected, to, assume, the, extent, to, which, an, adolescent, is, expected, to, share, family, responsibilities, is, one, large, determining, factor, in, normative, adolescent, behavior, for, instance, adolescents, in, certain, cultures, are, expected, to, contribute, significantly, to, household, chores, and, responsibilities, household, chores, are, frequently, divided, into, self, care, tasks, and, family, care, tasks, however, specific, household, responsibilities, for, adolescents, may, vary, by, culture, family, type, and, adolescent, age, some, research, has, shown, that, adolescent, participation, in, family, work, and, routines, has, a, positive, influence, on, the, development, of, an, adolescent, s, feelings, of, self, worth, care, and, concern, for, others, in, addition, to, the, sharing, of, household, chores, certain, cultures, expect, adolescents, to, share, in, their, family, s, financial, responsibilities, according, to, family, economic, and, financial, education, specialists, adolescents, develop, sound, money, management, skills, through, the, practices, of, saving, and, spending, money, as, well, as, through, planning, ahead, for, future, economic, goals, differences, between, families, in, the, distribution, of, financial, responsibilities, or, provision, of, allowance, may, reflect, various, social, background, circumstances, and, intrafamilial, processes, which, are, further, influenced, by, cultural, norms, and, values, as, well, as, by, the, business, sector, and, market, economy, of, a, given, society, for, instance, in, many, developing, countries, it, is, common, for, children, to, attend, fewer, years, of, formal, schooling, so, that, when, they, reach, adolescence, they, can, begin, working, while, adolescence, is, a, time, frequently, marked, by, participation, in, the, workforce, the, number, of, adolescents, in, the, workforce, is, much, lower, now, than, in, years, past, as, a, result, of, increased, accessibility, and, perceived, importance, of, formal, higher, education, for, example, half, of, all, 16, year, olds, in, china, were, employed, in, 1980, whereas, less, than, one, fourth, of, this, same, cohort, were, employed, in, 1990, furthermore, the, amount, of, time, adolescents, spend, on, work, and, leisure, activities, varies, greatly, by, culture, as, a, result, of, cultural, norms, and, expectations, as, well, as, various, socioeconomic, factors, american, teenagers, spend, less, time, in, school, or, working, and, more, time, on, leisure, activities, which, include, playing, sports, socializing, and, caring, for, their, appearance, than, do, adolescents, in, many, other, countries, these, differences, may, be, influenced, by, cultural, values, of, education, and, the, amount, of, responsibility, adolescents, are, expected, to, assume, in, their, family, or, community, time, management, financial, roles, and, social, responsibilities, of, adolescents, are, therefore, closely, connected, with, the, education, sector, and, processes, of, career, development, for, adolescents, as, well, as, to, cultural, norms, and, social, expectations, in, many, ways, adolescents, experiences, with, their, assumed, social, roles, and, responsibilities, determine, the, length, and, quality, of, their, initial, pathway, into, adult, roles, adolescence, is, frequently, characterized, by, a, transformation, of, an, adolescent, s, understanding, of, the, world, the, rational, direction, towards, a, life, course, and, the, active, seeking, of, new, ideas, rather, than, the, unquestioning, acceptance, of, adult, authority, an, adolescent, begins, to, develop, a, unique, belief, system, through, his, or, her, interaction, with, social, familial, and, cultural, environments, while, organized, religion, is, not, necessarily, a, part, of, every, adolescent, s, life, experience, youth, are, still, held, responsible, for, forming, a, set, of, beliefs, about, themselves, the, world, around, them, and, whatever, higher, powers, they, may, or, may, not, believe, in, this, process, is, often, accompanied, or, aided, by, cultural, traditions, that, intend, to, provide, a, meaningful, transition, to, adulthood, through, a, ceremony, ritual, confirmation, or, rite, of, passage, many, cultures, define, the, transition, into, adultlike, sexuality, by, specific, biological, or, social, milestones, in, an, adolescent, s, life, for, example, menarche, the, first, menstrual, period, of, a, female, or, semenarche, the, first, ejaculation, of, a, male, are, frequent, sexual, defining, points, for, many, cultures, in, addition, to, biological, factors, an, adolescent, s, sexual, socialization, is, highly, dependent, upon, whether, their, culture, takes, a, restrictive, or, permissive, attitude, toward, teen, or, premarital, sexual, activity, in, the, united, states, specifically, adolescents, are, said, to, have, raging, hormones, that, drive, their, sexual, desires, these, sexual, desires, are, then, dramatized, regarding, teen, sex, and, seen, as, a, site, of, danger, and, risk, that, such, danger, and, risk, is, a, source, of, profound, worry, among, adults, there, is, little, to, no, normalization, regarding, teenagers, having, sex, in, the, u, s, which, causes, conflict, in, how, adolescents, are, taught, about, sex, education, there, is, a, constant, debate, about, whether, abstinence, only, sex, education, or, comprehensive, sex, education, should, be, taught, in, schools, and, this, stems, back, to, whether, or, not, the, country, it, is, being, taught, in, is, permissive, or, restrictive, restrictive, cultures, overtly, discourage, sexual, activity, in, unmarried, adolescents, or, until, an, adolescent, undergoes, a, formal, rite, of, passage, these, cultures, may, attempt, to, restrict, sexual, activity, by, separating, males, and, females, throughout, their, development, or, through, public, shaming, and, physical, punishment, when, sexual, activity, does, occur, in, less, restrictive, cultures, there, is, more, tolerance, for, displays, of, adolescent, sexuality, or, of, the, interaction, between, males, and, females, in, public, and, private, spaces, less, restrictive, cultures, may, tolerate, some, aspects, of, adolescent, sexuality, while, objecting, to, other, aspects, for, instance, some, cultures, find, teenage, sexual, activity, acceptable, but, teenage, pregnancy, highly, undesirable, other, cultures, do, not, object, to, teenage, sexual, activity, or, teenage, pregnancy, as, long, as, they, occur, after, marriage, in, permissive, societies, overt, sexual, behavior, among, unmarried, teens, is, perceived, as, acceptable, and, is, sometimes, even, encouraged, regardless, of, whether, a, culture, is, restrictive, or, permissive, there, are, likely, to, be, discrepancies, in, how, females, versus, males, are, expected, to, express, their, sexuality, cultures, vary, in, how, overt, this, double, standard, is, in, some, it, is, legally, inscribed, while, in, others, it, is, communicated, through, social, convention, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and, transgender, youth, face, much, discrimination, through, bullying, from, those, unlike, them, and, may, find, telling, others, that, they, are, gay, to, be, a, traumatic, experience, the, range, of, sexual, attitudes, that, a, culture, embraces, could, thus, be, seen, to, affect, the, beliefs, lifestyles, and, societal, perceptions, of, its, adolescents, adolescence, is, a, period, frequently, marked, by, increased, rights, and, privileges, for, individuals, while, cultural, variation, exists, for, legal, rights, and, their, corresponding, ages, considerable, consistency, is, found, across, cultures, furthermore, since, the, advent, of, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, in, 1989, children, here, defined, as, under, 18, almost, every, country, in, the, world, except, the, u, s, and, south, sudan, has, legally, committed, to, advancing, an, anti, discriminatory, stance, towards, young, people, of, all, ages, this, includes, protecting, children, against, unchecked, child, labor, enrollment, in, the, military, prostitution, and, pornography, in, many, societies, those, who, reach, a, certain, age, often, 18, though, this, varies, are, considered, to, have, reached, the, age, of, majority, and, are, legally, regarded, as, adults, who, are, responsible, for, their, actions, people, below, this, age, are, considered, minors, or, children, a, person, below, the, age, of, majority, may, gain, adult, rights, through, legal, emancipation, the, legal, working, age, in, western, countries, is, usually, 14, to, 16, depending, on, the, number, of, hours, and, type, of, employment, under, consideration, many, countries, also, specify, a, minimum, school, leaving, age, at, which, a, person, is, legally, allowed, to, leave, compulsory, education, this, age, varies, greatly, cross, culturally, spanning, from, 10, to, 18, which, further, reflects, the, diverse, ways, formal, education, is, viewed, in, cultures, around, the, world, in, most, democratic, countries, a, citizen, is, eligible, to, vote, at, age, 18, in, a, minority, of, countries, the, voting, age, is, as, low, as, 16, for, example, brazil, and, at, one, time, was, as, high, as, 25, in, uzbekistan, the, age, of, consent, to, sexual, activity, varies, widely, between, jurisdictions, ranging, from, 12, to, 20, years, as, does, the, age, at, which, people, are, allowed, to, marry, specific, legal, ages, for, adolescents, that, also, vary, by, culture, are, enlisting, in, the, military, gambling, and, the, purchase, of, alcohol, cigarettes, or, items, with, parental, advisory, labels, the, legal, coming, of, age, often, does, not, correspond, with, the, sudden, realization, of, autonomy, many, adolescents, who, have, legally, reached, adult, age, are, still, dependent, on, their, guardians, or, peers, for, emotional, and, financial, support, nonetheless, new, legal, privileges, converge, with, shifting, social, expectations, to, usher, in, a, phase, of, heightened, independence, or, social, responsibility, for, most, legal, adolescents, following, a, steady, decline, beginning, in, the, late, 1990s, up, through, the, mid, 2000s, and, a, moderate, increase, in, the, early, 2010s, illicit, drug, use, among, adolescents, has, roughly, plateaued, in, the, u, s, aside, from, alcohol, marijuana, is, the, most, commonly, indulged, drug, habit, during, adolescent, years, data, collected, by, the, national, institute, on, drug, abuse, shows, that, between, the, years, of, 2015, and, 2018, past, year, marijuana, usage, among, 8th, graders, declined, from, 11, 8, to, 10, 5, among, 10th, grade, students, usage, rose, from, 25, 4, to, 27, 50, and, among, 12th, graders, usage, rose, slightly, from, 34, 9, to, 35, 9, additionally, while, the, early, 2010s, saw, a, surge, in, the, popularity, of, mdma, usage, has, stabilized, with, 2, 2, of, 12th, graders, using, mdma, in, the, past, year, in, the, u, s, the, heightened, usage, of, ecstasy, most, likely, ties, in, at, least, to, some, degree, with, the, rising, popularity, of, rave, culture, one, significant, contribution, to, the, increase, in, teenage, substance, abuse, is, an, increase, in, the, availability, of, prescription, medication, with, an, increase, in, the, diagnosis, of, behavioral, and, attentional, disorders, for, students, taking, pharmaceutical, drugs, such, as, vicodin, and, adderall, for, pleasure, has, become, a, prevalent, activity, among, adolescents, 9, 9, of, high, school, seniors, report, having, abused, prescription, drugs, within, the, past, year, in, the, u, s, teenage, alcohol, use, rose, in, the, late, 2000s, and, is, currently, stable, at, a, moderate, level, out, of, a, polled, body, of, u, s, students, age, 12, 18, 8, 2, of, 8th, graders, reported, having, been, on, at, least, one, occasion, having, consumed, alcohol, within, the, previous, month, for, 10th, graders, the, number, was, 18, 6, and, for, 12th, graders, 30, 2, more, drastically, cigarette, smoking, has, become, a, far, less, prevalent, activity, among, american, middle, and, high, school, students, in, fact, a, greater, number, of, teens, now, smoke, marijuana, than, smoke, cigarettes, with, one, recent, study, showing, a, respective, 23, 8, versus, 43, 6, of, surveyed, high, school, seniors, recent, studies, have, shown, that, male, late, adolescents, are, far, more, likely, to, smoke, cigarettes, rather, than, females, the, study, indicated, that, there, was, a, discernible, gender, difference, in, the, prevalence, of, smoking, among, the, students, the, finding, of, the, study, shows, that, more, males, than, females, began, smoking, when, they, were, in, primary, and, high, schools, whereas, most, females, started, smoking, after, high, school, this, may, be, attributed, to, recent, changing, social, and, political, views, towards, marijuana, issues, such, as, medicinal, use, and, legalization, have, tended, towards, painting, the, drug, in, a, more, positive, light, than, historically, while, cigarettes, continue, to, be, vilified, due, to, associated, health, risks, different, drug, habits, often, relate, to, one, another, in, a, highly, significant, manner, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, adolescents, who, drink, at, least, to, some, degree, may, be, as, much, as, sixteen, times, more, likely, than, non, drinkers, to, use, illicit, drugs, peer, acceptance, and, social, norms, gain, a, significantly, greater, hand, in, directing, behavior, at, the, onset, of, adolescence, as, such, the, alcohol, and, illegal, drug, habits, of, teens, tend, to, be, shaped, largely, by, the, substance, use, of, friends, and, other, classmates, in, fact, studies, suggest, that, more, significantly, than, actual, drug, norms, an, individual, s, perception, of, the, illicit, drug, use, by, friends, and, peers, is, highly, associated, with, his, or, her, own, habits, in, substance, use, during, both, middle, and, high, school, a, relationship, that, increases, in, strength, over, time, whereas, social, influences, on, alcohol, use, and, marijuana, use, tend, to, work, directly, in, the, short, term, peer, and, friend, norms, on, smoking, cigarettes, in, middle, school, have, a, profound, effect, on, one, s, own, likelihood, to, smoke, cigarettes, well, into, high, school, perhaps, the, strong, correlation, between, peer, influence, in, middle, school, and, cigarette, smoking, in, high, school, may, be, explained, by, the, addictive, nature, of, cigarettes, which, could, lead, many, students, to, continue, their, smoking, habits, from, middle, school, into, late, adolescence, until, mid, to, late, adolescence, boys, and, girls, show, relatively, little, difference, in, drinking, motives, distinctions, between, the, reasons, for, alcohol, consumption, of, males, and, females, begin, to, emerge, around, ages, 14, 15, overall, boys, tend, to, view, drinking, in, a, more, social, light, than, girls, who, report, on, average, a, more, frequent, use, of, alcohol, as, a, coping, mechanism, the, latter, effect, appears, to, shift, in, late, adolescence, and, onset, of, early, adulthood, 20, 21, years, of, age, however, despite, this, trend, age, tends, to, bring, a, greater, desire, to, drink, for, pleasure, rather, than, coping, in, both, boys, and, girls, drinking, habits, and, the, motives, behind, them, often, reflect, certain, aspects, of, an, individual, s, personality, in, fact, four, dimensions, of, the, five, factor, model, of, personality, demonstrate, associations, with, drinking, motives, all, but, openness, greater, enhancement, motives, for, alcohol, consumption, tend, to, reflect, high, levels, of, extraversion, and, sensation, seeking, in, individuals, such, enjoyment, motivation, often, also, indicates, low, conscientiousness, manifesting, in, lowered, inhibition, and, a, greater, tendency, towards, aggression, on, the, other, hand, drinking, to, cope, with, negative, emotional, states, correlates, strongly, with, high, neuroticism, and, low, agreeableness, alcohol, use, as, a, negative, emotion, control, mechanism, often, links, with, many, other, behavioral, and, emotional, impairments, such, as, anxiety, depression, and, low, self, esteem, research, has, generally, shown, striking, uniformity, across, different, cultures, in, the, motives, behind, teen, alcohol, use, social, engagement, and, personal, enjoyment, appear, to, play, a, fairly, universal, role, in, adolescents, decision, to, drink, throughout, separate, cultural, contexts, surveys, conducted, in, argentina, hong, kong, and, canada, have, each, indicated, the, most, common, reason, for, drinking, among, adolescents, to, relate, to, pleasure, and, recreation, 80, of, argentinian, teens, reported, drinking, for, enjoyment, while, only, 7, drank, to, improve, a, bad, mood, the, most, prevalent, answers, among, canadian, adolescents, were, to, get, in, a, party, mood, 18, because, i, enjoy, it, 16, and, to, get, drunk, 10, in, hong, kong, female, participants, most, frequently, reported, drinking, for, social, enjoyment, while, males, most, frequently, reported, drinking, to, feel, the, effects, of, alcohol, much, research, has, been, conducted, on, the, psychological, ramifications, of, body, image, on, adolescents, modern, day, teenagers, are, exposed, to, more, media, on, a, daily, basis, than, any, generation, before, them, as, such, modern, day, adolescents, are, exposed, to, many, representations, of, ideal, societal, beauty, the, concept, of, a, person, being, unhappy, with, their, own, image, or, appearance, has, been, defined, as, body, dissatisfaction, in, teenagers, body, dissatisfaction, is, often, associated, with, body, mass, low, self, esteem, and, atypical, eating, patterns, that, can, result, in, health, procedures, scholars, continue, to, debate, the, effects, of, media, on, body, dissatisfaction, in, teens, because, exposure, to, media, has, increased, over, the, past, decade, adolescents, use, of, computers, cell, phones, stereos, and, televisions, to, gain, access, to, various, mediums, of, popular, culture, has, also, increased, almost, all, american, households, have, at, least, one, television, more, than, three, quarters, of, all, adolescents, homes, have, access, to, the, internet, and, more, than, 90, of, american, adolescents, use, the, internet, at, least, occasionally, as, a, result, of, the, amount, of, time, adolescents, spend, using, these, devices, their, total, media, exposure, is, high, in, the, last, decade, the, amount, of, time, that, adolescents, spend, on, the, computer, has, greatly, increased, online, activities, with, the, highest, rates, of, use, among, adolescents, are, video, games, 78, of, adolescents, email, 73, instant, messaging, 68, social, networking, sites, 65, news, sources, 63, music, 59, and, videos, 57, in, the, 2000s, social, networking, sites, proliferated, and, a, high, proportion, of, adolescents, used, them, as, of, 2012, 73, of, 12, 17, year, olds, reported, having, at, least, one, social, networking, profile, two, thirds, 68, of, teens, texted, every, day, half, 51, visited, social, networking, sites, daily, and, 11, sent, or, received, tweets, at, least, once, every, day, more, than, a, third, 34, of, teens, visited, their, main, social, networking, site, several, times, a, day, one, in, four, 23, teens, were, heavy, social, media, users, meaning, they, used, at, least, two, different, types, of, social, media, each, and, every, day, although, research, has, been, inconclusive, some, findings, have, indicated, that, electronic, communication, negatively, affects, adolescents, social, development, replaces, face, to, face, communication, impairs, their, social, skills, and, can, sometimes, lead, to, unsafe, interaction, with, strangers, a, 2015, review, reported, that, adolescents, lack, awareness, of, strategies, to, cope, with, cyberbullying, which, has, been, consistently, associated, with, an, increased, likelihood, of, depression, furthermore, in, 2020, 32, of, adolescent, girls, that, use, instagram, reported, feeling, worse, about, their, body, image, after, using, the, platform, studies, have, shown, differences, in, the, ways, the, internet, negatively, impacts, adolescents, social, functioning, online, socializing, tends, to, make, girls, particularly, vulnerable, while, socializing, in, internet, caf, s, seems, only, to, affect, boys, academic, achievement, however, other, research, suggests, that, internet, communication, brings, friends, closer, and, is, beneficial, for, socially, anxious, teens, who, find, it, easier, to, interact, socially, online, a, broad, way, of, defining, adolescence, is, the, transition, from, child, to, adulthood, according, to, hogan, astone, 1986, this, transition, can, include, markers, such, as, leaving, school, starting, a, full, time, job, leaving, the, home, of, origin, getting, married, and, becoming, a, parent, for, the, first, time, however, the, time, frame, of, this, transition, varies, drastically, by, culture, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, adolescence, can, last, nearly, a, decade, but, in, others, the, transition, often, in, the, form, of, a, ceremony, can, last, for, only, a, few, days, some, examples, of, social, and, religious, transition, ceremonies, that, can, be, found, in, the, u, s, as, well, as, in, other, cultures, around, the, world, are, confirmation, bar, and, bat, mitzvahs, quincea, eras, sweet, sixteens, cotillions, and, d, butante, balls, in, other, countries, initiation, ceremonies, play, an, important, role, marking, the, transition, into, adulthood, or, the, entrance, into, adolescence, this, transition, may, be, accompanied, by, obvious, physical, changes, which, can, vary, from, a, change, in, clothing, to, tattoos, and, scarification, furthermore, transitions, into, adulthood, may, also, vary, by, gender, and, specific, rituals, may, be, more, common, for, males, or, for, females, this, illuminates, the, extent, to, which, adolescence, is, at, least, in, part, a, social, construction, it, takes, shape, differently, depending, on, the, cultural, context, and, may, be, enforced, more, by, cultural, practices, or, transitions, than, by, universal, chemical, or, biological, physical, changes, at, the, decision, making, point, of, their, lives, youth, are, susceptible, to, drug, addiction, sexual, abuse, peer, pressure, violent, crimes, and, other, illegal, activities, developmental, intervention, science, dis, is, a, fusion, of, the, literature, of, both, developmental, and, intervention, sciences, this, association, conducts, youth, interventions, that, mutually, assist, both, the, needs, of, the, community, as, well, as, psychologically, stranded, youth, by, focusing, on, risky, and, inappropriate, behaviors, while, promoting, positive, self, development, along, with, self, esteem, among, adolescents, the, concept, of, adolescence, has, been, criticized, by, experts, such, as, robert, epstein, who, state, that, an, undeveloped, brain, is, not, the, main, cause, of, teenagers, turmoils, some, have, criticized, the, concept, of, adolescence, because, it, is, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, in, human, history, created, by, modern, society, and, have, been, highly, critical, of, what, they, view, as, the, infantilization, of, young, adults, in, american, society, in, an, article, for, scientific, american, robert, epstein, and, jennifer, ong, state, that, american, style, teen, turmoil, is, absent, in, more, than, 100, cultures, around, the, world, suggesting, that, such, mayhem, is, not, biologically, inevitable, second, the, brain, itself, changes, in, response, to, experiences, raising, the, question, of, whether, adolescent, brain, characteristics, are, the, cause, of, teen, tumult, or, rather, the, result, of, lifestyle, and, experiences, david, moshman, has, also, stated, in, regards, to, adolescence, that, brain, research, is, crucial, for, a, full, picture, but, it, does, not, provide, an, ultimate, explanation, other, critics, of, the, concept, of, adolescence, do, point, at, individual, differences, in, brain, growth, rate, citing, that, some, though, not, all, early, teens, still, have, infantile, undeveloped, corpus, callosums, concluding, that, the, adult, in, every, adolescent, is, too, generalizing, these, people, tend, to, support, the, notion, that, a, more, interconnected, brain, makes, more, precise, distinctions, citing, pavlov, s, comparisons, of, conditioned, reflexes, in, different, species, and, that, there, is, a, non, arbitrary, threshold, at, which, distinctions, become, sufficiently, precise, to, correct, assumptions, afterward, as, opposed, to, being, ultimately, dependent, on, exterior, assumptions, for, communication, they, argue, that, this, threshold, is, the, one, at, which, an, individual, is, objectively, capable, of, speaking, for, himself, or, herself, as, opposed, to, culturally, arbitrary, measures, of, maturity, which, often, treat, this, ability, as, a, sign, of, immaturity, merely, because, it, leads, to, questioning, of, authorities, these, people, also, stress, the, low, probability, of, the, threshold, being, reached, at, a, birthday, and, instead, advocate, non, chronological, emancipation, at, the, threshold, of, afterward, correction, of, assumptions, they, sometimes, cite, similarities, between, adolescent, behavior, and, kz, syndrome, inmate, behavior, in, adults, in, prison, camps, such, as, aggression, being, explainable, by, oppression, and, immature, financial, or, other, risk, behavior, being, explainable, by, a, way, out, of, captivity, being, more, worth, to, captive, people, than, any, incremental, improvement, in, captivity, and, argue, that, this, theory, successfully, predicted, remaining, immature, behavior, after, reaching, the, age, of, majority, by, means, of, longer, term, traumatization, in, this, context, they, refer, to, the, fallibility, of, official, assumptions, about, what, is, good, or, bad, for, an, individual, concluding, that, paternalistic, rights, may, harm, the, individual, they, also, argue, that, since, it, never, took, many, years, to, move, from, one, group, to, another, to, avoid, inbreeding, in, the, paleolithic, evolutionary, psychology, is, unable, to, account, for, a, long, period, of, immature, risk, behavior
