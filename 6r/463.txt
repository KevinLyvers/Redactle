slalom, is, an, alpine, skiing, and, alpine, snowboarding, discipline, involving, skiing, between, poles, or, gates, these, are, spaced, more, closely, than, those, in, giant, slalom, super, giant, slalom, and, downhill, necessitating, quicker, and, shorter, turns, internationally, the, sport, is, contested, at, the, fis, alpine, world, ski, championships, and, at, the, olympic, winter, games, the, term, slalom, comes, from, the, morgedal, seljord, dialect, of, the, norwegian, word, slal, m, sla, meaning, slightly, inclining, hillside, and, l, m, meaning, track, after, skis, the, inventors, of, modern, skiing, classified, their, trails, according, to, their, difficulty, slal, m, was, a, trail, used, in, telemark, by, boys, and, girls, not, yet, able, to, try, themselves, on, the, more, challenging, runs, ufsil, m, was, a, trail, with, one, obstacle, ufse, like, a, jump, a, fence, a, difficult, turn, a, gorge, a, cliff, often, more, than, 10, metres, 33, ft, high, et, cetera, uvyrdsl, m, was, a, trail, with, several, obstacles, a, norwegian, military, downhill, competition, in, 1767, included, racing, downhill, among, trees, without, falling, or, breaking, skis, sondre, norheim, and, other, skiers, from, telemark, practiced, uvyrdsl, m, or, disrespectful, reckless, downhill, where, they, raced, downhill, in, difficult, and, untested, terrain, i, e, off, piste, the, 1866, ski, race, in, oslo, was, a, combined, cross, country, jumping, and, slalom, competition, in, the, slalom, participants, were, allowed, use, poles, for, braking, and, steering, and, they, were, given, points, for, style, appropriate, skier, posture, during, the, late, 19th, century, norwegian, skiers, participated, in, all, branches, jumping, slalom, and, cross, country, often, with, the, same, pair, of, skis, slalom, and, variants, of, slalom, were, often, referred, to, as, hill, races, around, 1900, hill, races, were, abandoned, in, the, oslo, championships, at, huseby, and, holmenkollen, mathias, zdarsky, s, development, of, the, lilienfeld, binding, helped, change, hill, races, into, a, specialty, of, the, alps, region, the, rules, for, the, modern, slalom, were, developed, by, arnold, lunn, in, 1922, for, the, british, national, ski, championships, and, adopted, for, alpine, skiing, at, the, 1936, winter, olympics, under, these, rules, gates, were, marked, by, pairs, of, flags, rather, than, single, ones, were, arranged, so, that, the, racers, had, to, use, a, variety, of, turn, lengths, to, negotiate, them, and, scoring, was, on, the, basis, of, time, alone, rather, than, on, both, time, and, style, a, course, is, constructed, by, laying, out, a, series, of, gates, formed, by, alternating, pairs, of, red, and, blue, poles, the, skier, must, pass, between, the, two, poles, forming, the, gate, with, the, tips, of, both, skis, and, the, skier, s, feet, passing, between, the, poles, a, course, has, 55, to, 75, gates, for, men, and, 40, to, 60, for, women, the, vertical, drop, for, a, men, s, course, is, 180, to, 220, m, 591, to, 722, ft, and, measures, slightly, less, for, women, the, gates, are, arranged, in, a, variety, of, configurations, to, challenge, the, competitor, because, the, offsets, are, relatively, small, in, slalom, ski, racers, take, a, fairly, direct, line, and, often, knock, the, poles, out, of, the, way, as, they, pass, which, is, known, as, blocking, the, main, blocking, technique, in, modern, slalom, is, cross, blocking, in, which, the, skier, takes, such, a, tight, line, and, angulates, so, strongly, that, he, or, she, is, able, to, block, the, gate, with, the, outside, hand, racers, employ, a, variety, of, protective, equipment, including, shin, pads, hand, guards, helmets, and, face, guards, traditionally, bamboo, poles, were, used, for, gates, the, rigidity, of, which, forced, skiers, to, maneuver, their, entire, body, around, each, gate, in, the, early, 1980s, rigid, poles, were, replaced, by, hard, plastic, poles, hinged, at, the, base, the, hinged, gates, require, according, to, fis, rules, only, that, the, skis, and, boots, of, the, skier, go, around, each, gate, the, new, gates, allow, a, more, direct, path, down, a, slalom, course, through, the, process, of, cross, blocking, or, shinning, the, gates, cross, blocking, is, a, technique, in, which, the, legs, go, around, the, gate, with, the, upper, body, inclined, toward, or, even, across, the, gate, in, this, case, the, racer, s, outside, pole, and, shinguards, hit, the, gate, knocking, it, down, and, out, of, the, way, cross, blocking, is, done, by, pushing, the, gate, down, with, the, arms, hands, or, shins, by, 1989, most, of, the, top, technical, skiers, in, the, world, had, adopted, the, cross, block, technique, with, the, innovation, of, shaped, skis, around, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, equipment, used, for, slalom, in, international, competition, changed, drastically, world, cup, skiers, commonly, skied, on, slalom, skis, at, a, length, of, 203, 207, centimetres, 79, 9, 81, 5, in, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, but, by, the, 2002, olympic, winter, games, in, salt, lake, city, the, majority, of, competitors, were, using, skis, measuring, 160, cm, 63, 0, in, or, less, the, downside, of, the, shorter, skis, was, that, athletes, found, that, recoveries, were, more, difficult, with, a, smaller, platform, underfoot, out, of, concern, for, the, safety, of, athletes, the, fis, began, to, set, minimum, ski, lengths, for, international, slalom, competition, the, minimum, was, initially, set, at, 155, cm, 61, 0, in, for, men, and, 150, cm, 59, 1, in, for, women, but, was, increased, to, 165, cm, 65, 0, in, for, men, and, 155, cm, 61, 0, in, for, women, for, the, 2003, 2004, season, the, equipment, minimums, and, maximums, imposed, by, the, international, ski, federation, fis, have, created, a, backlash, from, skiers, suppliers, and, fans, the, main, objection, is, that, the, federation, is, regressing, the, equipment, and, hence, the, sport, by, two, decades, american, bode, miller, hastened, the, shift, to, the, shorter, more, radical, sidecut, skis, when, he, achieved, unexpected, success, after, becoming, the, first, junior, olympic, athlete, to, adopt, the, equipment, in, giant, slalom, and, super, g, in, 1996, a, few, years, later, the, technology, was, adapted, to, slalom, skis, as, well, in, the, following, table, men, s, slalom, world, cup, podiums, in, the, world, cup, since, first, season, in, 1967
