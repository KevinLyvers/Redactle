https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef
beef, is, the, culinary, name, for, meat, from, cattle, bos, taurus, beef, can, be, prepared, in, various, ways, cuts, are, often, used, for, steak, which, can, be, cooked, to, varying, degrees, of, doneness, while, trimmings, are, often, ground, or, minced, as, found, in, most, hamburgers, beef, contains, protein, iron, and, vitamin, b12, along, with, other, kinds, of, red, meat, high, consumption, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, and, coronary, heart, disease, especially, when, processed, beef, has, a, high, environmental, impact, being, a, primary, driver, of, deforestation, with, the, highest, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, any, agricultural, product, in, prehistoric, times, humankind, hunted, aurochs, and, later, domesticated, them, since, that, time, numerous, breeds, of, cattle, have, been, bred, specifically, for, the, quality, or, quantity, of, their, meat, today, beef, is, the, third, most, widely, consumed, meat, in, the, world, after, pork, and, poultry, as, of, 2018, the, united, states, brazil, and, china, were, the, largest, producers, of, beef, some, religions, and, cultures, prohibit, beef, consumption, especially, indic, religions, like, hinduism, buddhists, and, sikhs, are, also, against, animal, slaughtering, but, they, do, not, have, a, wrongful, eating, doctrine, the, word, beef, is, from, the, latin, word, b, s, in, contrast, to, cow, which, is, from, middle, english, cou, both, words, have, the, same, indo, european, root, g, ou, after, the, norman, conquest, the, french, speaking, nobles, who, ruled, england, naturally, used, french, words, to, refer, to, the, meats, they, were, served, thus, various, anglo, saxon, words, were, used, for, the, animal, such, as, n, at, or, cu, for, adult, females, by, the, peasants, but, the, meat, was, called, boef, ox, modern, french, b, uf, by, the, french, nobles, who, did, not, often, deal, with, the, live, animal, when, it, was, served, to, them, this, is, one, example, of, the, common, english, dichotomy, between, the, words, for, animals, with, largely, germanic, origins, and, their, meat, with, romanic, origins, that, is, also, found, in, such, english, word, pairs, as, pig, pork, deer, venison, sheep, mutton, and, chicken, poultry, also, the, less, common, goat, chevon, beef, is, cognate, with, bovine, through, the, late, latin, bov, nus, the, rarely, used, plural, form, of, beef, is, beeves, people, have, eaten, the, flesh, of, bovines, since, prehistoric, times, some, of, the, earliest, known, cave, paintings, such, as, those, of, lascaux, show, aurochs, in, hunting, scenes, people, domesticated, cattle, to, provide, ready, access, to, beef, milk, and, leather, cattle, have, been, domesticated, at, least, twice, over, the, course, of, evolutionary, history, the, first, domestication, event, occurred, around, 10, 500, years, ago, with, the, evolution, of, bos, taurus, the, second, was, more, recent, around, 7, 000, years, ago, with, the, evolution, of, bos, indicus, in, the, indian, subcontinent, there, is, a, possible, third, domestication, event, 8, 500, years, ago, with, a, potential, third, species, bos, africanus, arising, in, africa, in, the, united, states, the, growth, of, the, beef, business, was, largely, due, to, expansion, in, the, southwest, upon, the, acquisition, of, grasslands, through, the, mexican, american, war, of, 1848, and, later, the, expulsion, of, the, plains, indians, from, this, region, and, the, midwest, the, american, livestock, industry, began, starting, primarily, with, the, taming, of, feral, and, semi, feral, longhorn, cattle, chicago, and, new, york, city, were, the, first, to, benefit, from, these, developments, in, their, stockyards, and, in, their, meat, markets, beef, cattle, are, raised, and, fed, using, a, variety, of, methods, including, feedlots, free, range, ranching, backgrounding, and, intensive, animal, farming, concentrated, animal, feeding, operations, cafos, commonly, referred, to, as, factory, farms, are, commonly, used, to, meet, the, demand, of, beef, production, cafos, supply, 70, 4, of, cows, in, the, us, market, and, 99, of, all, meat, in, the, united, states, supply, cattle, cafos, can, also, be, a, source, of, e, coli, contamination, in, the, food, supply, due, to, the, prevalence, of, manure, in, cafos, these, e, coli, contaminations, include, one, strain, e, coli, o157, h7, which, can, be, toxic, to, humans, because, cattle, typically, hold, this, strain, in, their, digestive, system, another, consequence, of, unsanitary, conditions, created, by, high, density, confinement, systems, is, increased, use, of, antibiotics, in, order, to, prevent, illness, an, analysis, of, fda, sales, data, by, the, natural, resources, defense, council, found, 42, of, medically, important, antibiotic, use, in, the, u, s, was, on, cattle, posing, concerns, about, the, development, of, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, in, 2023, production, was, forecast, to, peak, by, 2035, the, consumption, of, beef, poses, numerous, threats, to, the, natural, environment, of, all, agricultural, products, beef, requires, some, of, the, most, land, and, water, and, its, production, results, in, the, greatest, amount, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, ghg, air, pollution, and, water, pollution, a, 2021, study, added, up, ghg, emissions, from, the, entire, lifecycle, including, production, transportation, and, consumption, and, estimated, that, beef, contributed, about, 4, billion, tonnes, 9, of, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gases, in, 2010, 728, cattle, populations, graze, around, 26, of, all, land, on, earth, not, including, the, large, agricultural, fields, that, are, used, to, grow, cattle, feed, according, to, fao, ranching, induced, deforestation, is, one, of, the, main, causes, of, loss, of, some, unique, plant, and, animal, species, in, the, tropical, rainforests, of, central, and, south, america, as, well, as, carbon, release, in, the, atmosphere, beef, is, also, the, primary, driver, of, deforestation, in, the, amazon, with, around, 80, of, all, converted, land, being, used, to, rear, cattle, 91, of, amazon, land, deforested, since, 1970, has, been, converted, to, cattle, ranching, 41, of, global, deforestation, from, 2005, to, 2013, has, been, attributed, to, the, expansion, of, beef, production, this, is, due, to, the, higher, ratio, of, net, energy, of, gain, to, net, energy, of, maintenance, where, metabolizable, energy, intake, is, higher, the, ratio, of, feed, required, to, produce, an, equivalent, amount, of, beef, live, weight, has, been, estimated, at, 7, 1, to, 43, 1, compared, with, about, 2, 1, for, chicken, however, assumptions, about, feed, quality, are, implicit, in, such, generalizations, for, example, production, of, a, kilogram, of, beef, cattle, live, weight, may, require, between, 4, and, 5, kilograms, of, feed, high, in, protein, and, metabolizable, energy, content, or, more, than, 20, kilograms, of, feed, of, much, lower, quality, a, simple, exchange, of, beef, to, soy, beans, a, common, feed, source, for, cattle, in, americans, diets, would, according, to, one, estimate, result, in, meeting, between, 46, and, 74, percent, of, the, reductions, needed, to, meet, the, 2020, greenhouse, gas, emission, goals, of, the, united, states, as, pledged, in, 2009, a, 2021, csiro, trial, concluded, that, feeding, cattle, a, 3, diet, of, the, seaweed, asparagopsis, taxiformis, could, reduce, the, methane, component, of, their, emissions, by, 80, while, such, feed, options, are, still, experimental, even, when, looking, at, the, most, widely, used, feeds, around, the, globe, there, is, high, variability, in, efficiency, one, study, found, that, shifting, compositions, of, current, feeds, production, areas, and, informed, land, restoration, could, enable, greenhouse, gas, emissions, reductions, of, 34, 85, annually, 612, 1, 506, mtco2e, yr, 1, without, increasing, costs, to, global, beef, production, some, scientists, claim, that, the, demand, for, beef, is, contributing, to, significant, biodiversity, loss, as, it, is, a, significant, driver, of, deforestation, and, habitat, destruction, species, rich, habitats, such, as, significant, portions, of, the, amazon, region, are, being, converted, to, agriculture, for, meat, production, the, 2019, ipbes, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, also, concurs, that, the, beef, industry, plays, a, significant, role, in, biodiversity, loss, around, 25, to, nearly, 40, of, global, land, surface, is, being, used, for, livestock, farming, which, is, mostly, cattle, some, kinds, of, beef, may, receive, special, certifications, or, designations, based, on, criteria, including, their, breed, certified, angus, beef, certified, hereford, beef, origin, kobe, beef, carne, de, vila, belgian, blue, or, the, way, the, cattle, are, treated, fed, or, slaughtered, organic, grass, fed, kosher, or, halal, beef, some, countries, regulate, the, marketing, and, sale, of, beef, by, observing, criteria, post, slaughter, and, classifying, the, observed, quality, of, the, meat, in, 2018, the, united, states, brazil, and, china, produced, the, most, beef, with, 12, 22, million, tons, 9, 9, million, tons, and, 6, 46, million, tons, respectively, the, top, 3, beef, exporting, countries, in, 2019, were, australia, 14, 8, of, total, exports, the, united, states, 13, 4, of, total, exports, and, brazil, 12, 6, of, total, exports, beef, production, is, also, important, to, the, economies, of, japan, argentina, uruguay, canada, paraguay, mexico, belarus, and, nicaragua, as, per, 2020, brazil, was, the, largest, beef, exporter, in, the, world, followed, by, australia, united, states, india, includes, carabeef, only, and, argentina, brazil, australia, the, united, states, and, india, accounted, for, roughly, 61, of, the, world, s, beef, exports, the, world, produced, 60, 57, million, metric, tons, of, beef, in, 2020, down, 950k, metric, tons, from, the, prior, year, major, decline, for, production, of, beef, was, from, india, up, to, 510k, and, australia, down, to, 309k, metric, tons, from, the, prior, year, by, 2017, it, was, already, reported, that, farmers, in, nepal, kept, fewer, cattle, due, to, the, losses, imposed, by, a, longer, hot, season, 747, cow, calf, ranches, in, southeast, wyoming, are, expected, to, suffer, greater, losses, in, the, future, as, the, hydrological, cycle, becomes, more, variable, and, affects, forage, growth, even, though, the, annual, mean, precipitation, is, not, expected, to, change, much, there, will, be, more, unusually, dry, years, as, well, as, unusually, wet, years, and, the, negatives, will, outweigh, the, positives, keeping, smaller, herds, to, be, more, flexible, when, dry, years, hit, was, suggested, as, an, adaptation, strategy, since, more, variable, and, therefore, less, predictable, precipitation, is, one, of, the, well, established, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, water, cycle, 85, similar, patterns, were, later, established, across, the, rest, of, the, united, states, and, then, globally, most, beef, can, be, used, as, is, by, merely, cutting, into, certain, parts, such, as, roasts, short, ribs, or, steak, filet, mignon, sirloin, steak, rump, steak, rib, steak, rib, eye, steak, hanger, steak, etc, while, other, cuts, are, processed, corned, beef, or, beef, jerky, trimmings, on, the, other, hand, which, are, usually, mixed, with, meat, from, older, leaner, therefore, tougher, cattle, are, ground, minced, or, used, in, sausages, the, blood, is, used, in, some, varieties, called, blood, sausage, other, parts, that, are, eaten, include, other, muscles, and, offal, such, as, the, oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe, from, the, reticulum, or, rumen, glands, particularly, the, pancreas, and, thymus, referred, to, as, sweetbread, the, heart, the, brain, although, forbidden, where, there, is, a, danger, of, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, bse, commonly, referred, to, as, mad, cow, disease, the, kidneys, and, the, tender, testicles, of, the, bull, known, in, the, united, states, as, calf, fries, prairie, oysters, or, rocky, mountain, oysters, some, intestines, are, cooked, and, eaten, as, is, but, are, more, often, cleaned, and, used, as, natural, sausage, casings, the, bones, are, used, for, making, beef, stock, meat, from, younger, cows, calves, is, called, veal, beef, from, steers, and, heifers, is, similar, beef, is, first, divided, into, primal, cuts, large, pieces, of, the, animal, initially, separated, by, butchering, these, are, basic, sections, from, which, steaks, and, other, subdivisions, are, cut, the, term, primal, cut, is, quite, different, from, prime, cut, used, to, characterize, cuts, considered, to, be, of, higher, quality, since, the, animal, s, legs, and, neck, muscles, do, the, most, work, they, are, the, toughest, the, meat, becomes, more, tender, as, distance, from, hoof, and, horn, increases, different, countries, and, cuisines, have, different, cuts, and, names, and, sometimes, use, the, same, name, for, a, different, cut, for, example, the, cut, described, as, brisket, in, the, united, states, is, from, a, significantly, different, part, of, the, carcass, than, british, brisket, to, improve, tenderness, of, beef, it, is, often, aged, i, e, stored, refrigerated, to, allow, endogenous, proteolytic, enzymes, to, weaken, structural, and, myofibrillar, proteins, wet, aging, is, accomplished, using, vacuum, packaging, to, reduce, spoilage, and, yield, loss, dry, aging, involves, hanging, primals, usually, ribs, or, loins, in, humidity, controlled, coolers, outer, surfaces, dry, out, and, can, support, growth, of, molds, and, spoilage, bacteria, if, too, humid, resulting, in, trim, and, evaporative, losses, evaporation, concentrates, the, remaining, proteins, and, increases, flavor, intensity, the, molds, can, contribute, a, nut, like, flavor, after, two, to, three, days, there, are, significant, effects, the, majority, of, the, tenderizing, effect, occurs, in, the, first, 10, days, boxed, beef, stored, and, distributed, in, vacuum, packaging, is, in, effect, wet, aged, during, distribution, premium, steakhouses, dry, age, for, 21, to, 28, days, or, wet, age, up, to, 45, days, for, maximum, effect, on, flavor, and, tenderness, meat, from, less, tender, cuts, or, older, cattle, can, be, mechanically, tenderized, by, forcing, small, sharp, blades, through, the, cuts, to, disrupt, the, proteins, also, solutions, of, exogenous, proteolytic, enzymes, papain, bromelin, or, ficin, can, be, applied, or, injected, to, augment, the, endogenous, enzymes, this, can, be, done, with, purified, enzyme, or, by, using, a, marinade, including, ingredients, that, naturally, contain, the, enzyme, e, g, papaya, for, papain, or, pineapple, for, bromelin, similarly, solutions, of, salt, and, sodium, phosphates, can, be, injected, to, soften, and, swell, the, myofibrillar, proteins, this, improves, juiciness, and, tenderness, salt, can, improve, the, flavor, but, phosphate, can, contribute, a, soapy, flavor, these, methods, are, applicable, to, all, types, of, meat, and, some, other, foodstuffs, beef, can, be, cooked, to, various, degrees, from, very, rare, to, well, done, the, degree, of, cooking, corresponds, to, the, temperature, in, the, approximate, center, of, the, meat, which, can, be, measured, with, a, meat, thermometer, beef, can, be, cooked, using, the, sous, vide, method, which, cooks, the, entire, steak, to, the, same, temperature, but, when, cooked, using, a, method, such, as, broiling, or, roasting, it, is, typically, cooked, such, that, it, has, a, bulls, eye, of, doneness, with, the, least, done, coolest, at, the, center, and, the, most, done, warmest, at, the, outside, meat, can, be, cooked, in, boiling, oil, typically, by, shallow, frying, although, deep, frying, may, be, used, often, for, meat, enrobed, with, breadcrumbs, as, in, milanesas, or, finger, steaks, larger, pieces, such, as, steaks, may, be, cooked, this, way, or, meat, may, be, cut, smaller, as, in, stir, frying, typically, an, asian, way, of, cooking, cooking, oil, with, flavorings, such, as, garlic, ginger, and, onions, is, put, in, a, very, hot, wok, then, small, pieces, of, meat, are, added, followed, by, ingredients, which, cook, more, quickly, such, as, mixed, vegetables, the, dish, is, ready, when, the, ingredients, are, just, cooked, moist, heat, cooking, methods, include, braising, pot, roasting, stewing, and, sous, vide, these, techniques, are, often, used, for, cuts, of, beef, that, are, tougher, as, these, longer, lower, temperature, cooking, methods, have, time, to, dissolve, connecting, tissue, which, otherwise, makes, meat, remain, tough, after, cooking, meat, has, usually, been, cooked, in, water, which, is, just, simmering, such, as, in, stewing, higher, temperatures, make, meat, tougher, by, causing, the, proteins, to, contract, since, thermostatic, temperature, control, became, available, cooking, at, temperatures, well, below, boiling, 52, c, 126, f, sous, vide, to, 90, c, 194, f, slow, cooking, for, prolonged, periods, has, become, possible, this, is, just, hot, enough, to, convert, the, tough, collagen, in, connective, tissue, into, gelatin, through, hydrolysis, with, minimal, toughening, with, the, adequate, combination, of, temperature, and, cooking, time, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, will, be, killed, and, pasteurization, can, be, achieved, because, browning, maillard, reactions, can, only, occur, at, higher, temperatures, above, the, boiling, point, of, water, these, moist, techniques, do, not, develop, the, flavors, associated, with, browning, meat, will, often, undergo, searing, in, a, very, hot, pan, grilling, or, browning, with, a, torch, before, moist, cooking, though, sometimes, after, thermostatically, controlled, methods, such, as, sous, vide, can, also, prevent, overcooking, by, bringing, the, meat, to, the, exact, degree, of, doneness, desired, and, holding, it, at, that, temperature, indefinitely, the, combination, of, precise, temperature, control, and, long, cooking, duration, makes, it, possible, to, be, assured, that, pasteurization, has, been, achieved, both, on, the, surface, and, the, interior, of, even, very, thick, cuts, of, meat, which, can, not, be, assured, with, most, other, cooking, techniques, although, extremely, long, duration, cooking, can, break, down, the, texture, of, the, meat, to, an, undesirable, degree, beef, can, be, cooked, quickly, at, the, table, through, several, techniques, in, hot, pot, cooking, such, as, shabu, shabu, very, thinly, sliced, meat, is, cooked, by, the, diners, at, the, table, by, immersing, it, in, a, heated, pot, of, water, or, stock, with, vegetables, in, fondue, bourguignonne, diners, dip, small, pieces, of, beef, into, a, pot, of, hot, oil, at, the, table, both, techniques, typically, feature, accompanying, flavorful, sauces, to, complement, the, meat, steak, tartare, is, a, french, dish, made, from, finely, chopped, or, ground, minced, raw, meat, often, beef, more, accurately, it, is, scraped, so, as, not, to, let, even, the, slightest, of, the, sinew, fat, get, into, the, scraped, meat, it, is, often, served, with, onions, capers, seasonings, such, as, fresh, ground, pepper, and, worcestershire, sauce, and, sometimes, raw, egg, yolk, the, belgian, or, dutch, dish, filet, am, ricain, is, also, made, of, finely, chopped, ground, beef, though, it, is, seasoned, differently, and, either, eaten, as, a, main, dish, or, can, be, used, as, a, dressing, for, a, sandwich, kibbeh, nayyeh, is, a, similar, lebanese, and, syrian, dish, and, in, ethiopia, a, ground, raw, meat, dish, called, tire, siga, or, kitfo, is, eaten, upon, availability, carpaccio, of, beef, is, a, thin, slice, of, raw, beef, dressed, with, olive, oil, lemon, juice, and, seasoning, often, the, beef, is, partially, frozen, before, slicing, to, allow, very, thin, slices, to, be, cut, yukhoe, is, a, variety, of, hoe, raw, dishes, in, korean, cuisine, which, is, usually, made, from, raw, ground, beef, seasoned, with, various, spices, or, sauces, the, beef, part, used, for, yukhoe, is, tender, rump, steak, for, the, seasoning, soy, sauce, sugar, salt, sesame, oil, green, onion, and, ground, garlic, sesame, seed, black, pepper, and, juice, of, bae, korean, pear, are, used, the, beef, is, mostly, topped, with, the, yolk, of, a, raw, egg, bresaola, is, an, air, dried, salted, beef, that, has, been, aged, about, two, to, three, months, until, it, becomes, hard, and, a, dark, red, almost, purple, colour, it, is, lean, has, a, sweet, musty, smell, and, is, tender, it, originated, in, valtellina, a, valley, in,

biltong, is, a, cured, salted, air, dried, beef, popular, in, south, africa, pastrami, is, often, made, from, beef, raw, beef, is, salted, then, partly, dried, and, seasoned, with, various, herbs, and, spices, and, smoked, corned, beef, is, a, cut, of, beef, cured, or, pickled, in, a, seasoned, brine, the, corn, in, corned, beef, refers, to, the, grains, of, coarse, salts, known, as, corns, used, to, cure, it, the, term, corned, beef, can, denote, different, styles, of, brine, cured, beef, depending, on, the, region, some, like, american, style, corned, beef, are, highly, seasoned, and, often, considered, delicatessen, fare, spiced, beef, is, a, cured, and, salted, joint, of, round, topside, or, silverside, traditionally, served, at, christmas, in, ireland, it, is, a, form, of, salt,

other, recipes, for, pickled, beef, sauerbraten, is, a, german, variant, beef, is, the, third, most, widely, consumed, meat, in, the, world, accounting, for, about, 25, of, meat, production, worldwide, after, pork, and, poultry, at, 38, and, 30, respectively, beef, is, a, source, of, complete, protein, and, it, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, niacin, vitamin, b12, iron, and, zinc, but, also, contains, high, amounts, of, saturated, fat, red, meat, is, the, most, significant, dietary, source, of, carnitine, and, like, any, other, meat, pork, fish, veal, lamb, etc, is, a, source, of, creatine, creatine, is, converted, to, creatinine, during, cooking, consumption, of, red, meat, and, especially, processed, red, meat, is, known, to, increase, the, risk, of, bowel, cancer, and, some, other, cancers, a, 2010, meta, analysis, found, that, processed, red, meat, and, all, processed, meat, was, correlated, with, a, higher, risk, of, coronary, heart, disease, although, based, on, studies, that, separated, the, two, this, meta, analysis, found, that, red, meat, intake, was, not, associated, with, higher, incidence, of, coronary, heart, disease, as, of, 2020, there, is, substantial, evidence, for, a, link, between, high, consumption, of, red, meat, and, coronary, heart, disease, some, cattle, raised, in, the, united, states, feed, on, pastures, fertilized, with, sewage, sludge, elevated, dioxins, may, be, present, in, meat, from, these, cattle, ground, beef, has, been, subject, to, recalls, in, the, united, states, due, to, escherichia, coli, e, coli, contamination, in, 1984, the, use, of, meat, and, bone, meal, in, cattle, feed, resulted, in, the, world, s, first, outbreak, of, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, bse, or, colloquially, mad, cow, disease, in, the, united, kingdom, since, then, other, countries, have, had, outbreaks, of, bse, in, 2010, the, eu, through, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, proposed, a, roadmap, to, gradually, lift, the, restrictions, on, the, feed, ban, in, 2013, the, ban, on, feeding, mammal, based, products, to, cattle, was, amended, to, allow, for, certain, milk, fish, eggs, and, plant, fed, farm, animal, products, to, be, used, most, indic, religions, reject, the, killing, and, eating, of, cows, hinduism, prohibits, cow, beef, known, as, go, maans, in, hindi, bovines, have, a, sacred, status, in, india, especially, the, cow, due, to, their, provision, of, sustenance, for, families, bovines, are, generally, considered, to, be, integral, to, the, landscape, however, they, do, not, consider, the, cow, to, be, a, god, many, of, india, s, rural, economies, depend, on, cattle, farming, hence, they, have, been, revered, in, society, since, the, vedic, period, cattle, especially, cows, were, venerated, as, a, source, of, milk, and, dairy, products, and, their, relative, importance, in, transport, services, and, farming, like, ploughing, row, planting,
