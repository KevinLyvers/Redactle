shogi, sh, gi, english, o, i, japanese, also, known, as, japanese, chess, is, a, strategy, board, game, for, two, players, it, is, one, of, the, most, popular, board, games, in, japan, and, is, in, the, same, family, of, games, as, western, chess, chaturanga, xiangqi, indian, chess, and, janggi, sh, gi, means, general, s, sh, board, game, gi, shogi, was, the, earliest, historical, chess, related, game, to, allow, captured, pieces, to, be, returned, to, the, board, by, the, capturing, player, this, drop, rule, is, speculated, to, have, been, invented, in, the, 15th, century, and, possibly, connected, to, the, practice, of, 15th, century, mercenaries, switching, loyalties, when, captured, instead, of, being, killed, the, earliest, predecessor, of, the, game, chaturanga, originated, in, india, in, the, 6th, century, and, the, game, was, likely, transmitted, to, japan, via, china, or, korea, sometime, after, the, nara, period, shogi, in, its, present, form, was, played, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, while, a, direct, ancestor, without, the, drop, rule, was, recorded, from, 1210, in, a, historical, document, nich, reki, which, is, an, edited, copy, of, sh, ch, reki, and, kaich, reki, from, the, late, heian, period, c, 1120, two, players, face, each, other, across, a, board, composed, of, rectangles, in, a, grid, of, 9, ranks, rows, by, 9, files, columns, yielding, an, 81, square, board, in, japanese, they, are, called, sente, first, player, and, gote, second, player, but, in, english, are, conventionally, referred, to, as, black, and, white, with, black, the, first, player, the, board, is, nearly, always, rectangular, and, the, rectangles, are, undifferentiated, by, marking, or, color, pairs, of, dots, mark, the, players, promotion, zones, each, player, has, a, set, of, 20, flat, wedge, shaped, pentagonal, pieces, of, slightly, different, sizes, except, for, the, kings, opposing, pieces, are, undifferentiated, by, marking, or, color, pieces, face, forward, by, having, the, pointed, side, of, each, piece, oriented, toward, the, opponent, s, side, this, shows, who, controls, the, piece, during, play, the, pieces, from, largest, most, important, to, smallest, least, important, are, several, of, these, names, were, chosen, to, correspond, to, their, rough, equivalents, in, international, chess, and, not, as, literal, translations, of, the, japanese, names, each, piece, has, its, name, written, on, its, surface, in, the, form, of, two, kanji, chinese, characters, used, as, syllabograms, or, as, logograms, to, record, texts, in, old, japanese, usually, in, black, ink, on, the, reverse, side, of, each, piece, other, than, the, king, and, gold, general, are, one, or, two, other, characters, in, amateur, sets, often, in, a, different, color, usually, red, this, side, is, turned, face, up, during, play, to, indicate, that, the, piece, has, been, promoted, in, some, cases, the, backsides, of, the, king, pieces, the, narrow, side, which, faces, back, toward, the, player, during, normal, play, will, display, kanji, containing, additional, information, about, the, piece, manufacturers, following, is, a, table, of, the, pieces, with, their, japanese, representations, and, english, equivalents, the, abbreviations, are, used, for, game, notation, and, often, when, referring, to, the, pieces, in, speech, in, japanese, english, speakers, sometimes, refer, to, promoted, bishops, as, horses, and, promoted, rooks, as, dragons, after, their, japanese, names, and, generally, use, the, japanese, term, tokin, for, promoted, pawns, silver, generals, and, gold, generals, are, commonly, referred, to, simply, as, silvers, and, golds, respectively, the, characters, inscribed, on, the, reverse, sides, of, the, pieces, to, indicate, promotion, may, be, in, red, ink, and, are, usually, cursive, the, characters, on, the, backs, of, the, pieces, that, promote, to, gold, generals, are, cursive, variants, of, gold, becoming, more, cursive, more, abbreviated, as, the, value, of, the, original, piece, decreases, these, cursive, forms, have, these, equivalents, in, print, for, promoted, silver, for, promoted, knight, for, promoted, lance, and, for, promoted, pawn, tokin, another, typographic, convention, has, abbreviated, versions, of, the, original, values, with, a, reduced, number, of, strokes, for, a, promoted, knight, for, a, promoted, lance, and, the, as, above, for, a, promoted, silver, but, a, hiragana, symbol, for, the, syllable, to, for, tokin, the, suggestion, that, the, japanese, characters, have, deterred, western, players, from, learning, shogi, has, led, to, westernized, or, international, pieces, which, use, iconic, symbols, instead, of, characters, most, players, soon, learn, to, recognize, the, characters, however, partially, because, the, traditional, pieces, are, already, iconic, by, size, with, more, powerful, pieces, being, larger, as, a, result, westernized, pieces, have, never, become, popular, bilingual, pieces, with, both, japanese, characters, and, english, captions, have, been, developed, as, have, pieces, with, animal, cartoons, each, player, sets, up, friendly, pieces, facing, forward, toward, the, opponent, a, furigoma, piece, toss, is, used, to, decide, who, moves, first, one, of, the, players, tosses, five, pawns, if, the, number, of, tokins, promoted, pawns, facing, up, is, higher, than, unpromoted, pawns, then, the, player, who, tossed, the, pawns, plays, gote, white, that, is, getting, the, second, move, after, the, piece, toss, furigoma, the, game, proceeds, if, multiple, games, are, played, then, players, alternate, turns, for, who, goes, first, in, subsequent, games, the, terms, black, and, white, are, used, to, differentiate, sides, although, there, is, no, difference, in, the, color, of, the, pieces, for, each, turn, a, player, may, either, move, a, piece, that, is, currently, on, the, board, and, potentially, promote, it, capture, an, opposing, piece, or, both, or, else, drop, a, piece, that, has, been, previously, captured, onto, a, square, of, the, board, these, options, are, explained, below, the, usual, goal, of, a, game, is, for, one, player, to, checkmate, the, other, player, s, king, winning, the, game, most, shogi, pieces, can, move, only, to, an, adjacent, square, a, few, may, move, across, the, board, and, one, jumps, over, intervening, pieces, the, lance, bishop, and, rook, are, ranging, pieces, they, can, move, any, number, of, squares, along, a, straight, line, limited, only, by, intervening, pieces, and, the, edge, of, the, board, if, an, opposing, piece, intervenes, it, may, be, captured, by, removing, it, from, the, board, and, replacing, it, with, the, moving, piece, if, a, friendly, piece, intervenes, the, moving, piece, must, stop, short, of, that, square, if, the, friendly, piece, is, adjacent, the, moving, piece, may, not, move, in, that, direction, at, all, a, king, moves, one, square, in, any, direction, orthogonal, or, diagonal, a, rook, moves, any, number, of, squares, in, an, orthogonal, direction, a, bishop, moves, any, number, of, squares, in, a, diagonal, direction, because, they, cannot, move, orthogonally, the, players, unpromoted, bishops, can, reach, only, half, the, squares, of, the, board, unless, one, is, captured, and, then, dropped, a, gold, general, moves, one, square, orthogonally, or, one, square, diagonally, forward, giving, it, six, possible, destinations, it, cannot, move, diagonally, backwards, a, silver, general, moves, one, square, diagonally, or, one, square, straight, forward, giving, it, five, possible, destinations, because, an, unpromoted, silver, can, retreat, more, easily, than, a, promoted, one, it, is, common, to, leave, a, silver, unpromoted, at, the, far, side, of, the, board, see, promotion, a, knight, jumps, at, an, angle, intermediate, to, orthogonal, and, diagonal, amounting, to, one, square, straight, forward, plus, one, square, diagonally, forward, in, a, single, move, thus, the, knight, has, two, possible, forward, destinations, unlike, international, chess, knights, shogi, knights, cannot, move, to, the, sides, or, in, a, backwards, direction, the, knight, is, the, only, piece, that, ignores, intervening, pieces, on, the, way, to, its, destination, it, is, not, blocked, from, moving, if, the, square, in, front, of, it, is, occupied, but, neither, can, it, capture, a, piece, on, that, square, it, is, often, useful, to, leave, a, knight, unpromoted, at, the, far, side, of, the, board, a, knight, must, promote, however, if, it, reaches, either, of, the, two, furthest, ranks, see, promotion, a, lance, moves, just, like, the, rook, except, it, cannot, move, backwards, or, to, the, sides, it, is, often, useful, to, leave, a, lance, unpromoted, at, the, far, side, of, the, board, a, lance, must, promote, however, if, it, reaches, the, furthest, rank, see, promotion, a, pawn, moves, one, square, straight, forward, it, cannot, retreat, unlike, international, chess, pawns, shogi, pawns, capture, the, same, as, they, move, a, pawn, must, promote, if, it, arrives, at, the, furthest, rank, see, promotion, in, practice, however, a, pawn, is, usually, promoted, whenever, possible, there, are, two, restrictions, on, where, a, pawn, may, be, dropped, see, drops, all, pieces, but, the, knight, move, either, horizontally, vertically, or, diagonally, these, directions, cannot, be, combined, in, a, single, move, one, direction, must, be, chosen, every, piece, blocks, the, movement, of, all, other, non, jumping, pieces, through, the, square, it, occupies, if, a, piece, occupies, a, legal, destination, for, an, opposing, piece, it, may, be, captured, by, removing, it, from, the, board, and, replacing, it, with, the, opposing, piece, the, capturing, piece, may, not, continue, beyond, that, square, on, that, turn, shogi, pieces, capture, the, same, as, they, move, normally, when, moving, a, piece, a, player, snaps, it, to, the, board, with, the, ends, of, the, fingers, of, the, same, hand, this, makes, a, sudden, sound, effect, bringing, the, piece, to, the, attention, of, the, opponent, this, is, also, true, for, capturing, and, dropping, pieces, on, a, traditional, shogi, ban, the, pitch, of, the, snap, is, deeper, delivering, a, subtler, effect, a, player, s, promotion, zone, consists, of, the, furthest, one, third, of, the, board, the, three, ranks, occupied, by, the, opponent, s, pieces, at, setup, the, zone, is, typically, delineated, on, shogi, boards, by, two, inscribed, dots, when, a, piece, is, moved, if, part, of, the, piece, s, path, lies, within, the, promotion, zone, that, is, if, the, piece, moves, into, out, of, or, wholly, within, the, zone, but, not, if, it, is, dropped, into, the, zone, see, drops, then, the, player, has, the, option, to, promote, the, piece, at, the, end, of, the, turn, promotion, is, indicated, by, turning, the, piece, over, after, it, moves, revealing, the, character, of, the, promoted, piece, promoting, a, piece, is, usually, not, compulsory, however, if, a, pawn, or, lance, is, moved, to, the, furthest, rank, or, a, knight, is, moved, to, either, of, the, two, furthest, ranks, that, piece, must, promote, otherwise, it, would, have, no, legal, move, on, subsequent, turns, a, silver, general, is, never, required, to, promote, and, it, is, often, advantageous, to, keep, a, silver, general, unpromoted, it, is, easier, for, example, to, extract, an, unpromoted, silver, from, behind, enemy, lines, a, promoted, silver, with, only, one, line, of, retreat, can, be, easily, blocked, rooks, bishops, and, pawns, are, almost, always, promoted, as, these, pieces, do, not, lose, any, of, their, powers, upon, promotion, promoting, a, piece, changes, the, way, it, moves, the, various, pieces, promote, as, follows, when, captured, a, piece, loses, its, promoted, status, otherwise, promotion, is, permanent, a, promoted, rook, literally, dragon, king, ry, shortended, forms, ry, and, ry, moves, as, a, rook, and, as, a, king, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, dragon, a, promoted, bishop, literally, dragon, horse, ry, ma, shortened, form, uma, moves, as, a, bishop, and, as, a, king, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, horse, a, promoted, silver, narigin, alternate, forms, cursive, a, promoted, knight, narikei, alternate, forms, cursive, a, promoted, lance, nariky, alternate, forms, cursive, and, a, promoted, pawn, tokin, alternate, forms, all, move, the, same, way, as, a, gold, general, the, promoted, pawn, is, often, called, by, its, japanese, name, tokin, even, by, non, japanese, players, captured, pieces, are, retained, in, hand, and, can, be, brought, back, into, play, under, the, capturing, player, s, control, the, japanese, term, for, piece, s, in, hand, is, either, mochigoma, or, tegoma, on, any, turn, instead, of, moving, a, piece, on, the, board, a, player, may, select, a, piece, in, hand, and, place, it, unpromoted, side, up, and, facing, the, opposing, side, on, any, empty, square, the, piece, is, then, one, of, that, player, s, active, pieces, on, the, board, and, can, be, moved, accordingly, this, is, called, dropping, the, piece, or, simply, a, drop, a, drop, counts, as, a, complete, move, a, drop, cannot, capture, a, piece, nor, does, dropping, within, the, promotion, zone, result, in, immediate, promotion, capture, and, or, promotion, may, occur, normally, however, on, subsequent, moves, of, the, piece, restrictions, there, are, three, restrictions, on, dropping, pieces, the, last, two, of, these, apply, only, to, pawns, a, corollary, of, the, second, restriction, is, that, a, player, with, an, unpromoted, pawn, on, every, file, is, unable, to, drop, a, pawn, anywhere, for, this, reason, it, is, common, to, sacrifice, a, pawn, in, order, to, gain, flexibility, for, drops, captured, pieces, are, typically, kept, on, a, wooden, stand, komadai, which, is, traditionally, placed, so, that, its, bottom, left, corner, aligns, with, the, bottom, right, corner, of, the, board, from, the, perspective, of, each, player, it, is, not, permissible, to, hide, pieces, from, full, view, it, is, common, for, players, to, swap, bishops, which, oppose, each, other, across, the, board, early, in, the, game, this, leaves, each, player, with, a, bishop, in, hand, to, be, dropped, later, the, ability, for, drops, in, shogi, gives, the, game, tactical, richness, and, complexity, the, fact, that, no, piece, ever, goes, entirely, out, of, play, accounts, for, the, rarity, of, draws, when, a, player, s, move, threatens, to, capture, the, opposing, king, on, the, next, turn, the, move, is, said, to, give, check, to, the, king, and, the, king, is, said, to, be, in, check, if, a, player, s, king, is, in, check, that, player, s, responding, move, must, remove, the, check, ways, to, remove, a, check, include, moving, the, king, away, from, the, threat, capturing, the, threatening, piece, or, placing, another, interposing, piece, between, the, king, and, the, threatening, piece, to, announce, check, in, japanese, one, can, say, te, however, this, is, an, influence, of, international, chess, and, is, not, required, even, as, a, courtesy, it, may, be, common, to, announce, te, in, beginner, matches, or, for, local, rules, to, dictate, that, you, have, to, announce, it, announcing, a, check, vocally, is, unheard, of, in, competitive, tournaments, the, usual, way, for, shogi, games, to, end, is, for, one, side, to, checkmate, the, other, side, s, king, after, which, the, losing, player, will, be, given, the, opportunity, to, admit, defeat, unlike, western, chess, or, xiangqi, checkmate, is, almost, always, the, result, in, shogi, since, pieces, never, retire, from, play, which, gives, the, players, a, sufficient, number, of, pieces, to, deliver, checkmate, that, said, there, are, three, other, possible, ways, for, a, game, to, end, repetition, sennichite, impasse, jish, gi, and, an, illegal, move, hansokute, the, first, two, repetition, and, impasse, are, particularly, uncommon, illegal, moves, are, also, uncommon, in, professional, games, although, this, may, not, be, true, with, amateur, players, especially, beginners, unlike, western, chess, there, is, no, tradition, of, offering, a, mutual, draw, by, agreement, if, the, king, is, in, check, and, there, is, no, possible, move, which, could, protect, the, king, the, move, is, said, to, checkmate, tsumi, the, king, checkmate, effectively, means, that, the, opponent, wins, the, game, as, the, player, would, have, no, remaining, legal, moves, see, also, tsumeshogi, hisshi, the, losing, player, will, usually, resign, when, the, situation, is, thought, to, be, hopeless, and, may, declare, the, resignation, at, any, time, during, their, turn, although, a, player, may, resign, just, after, they, are, checkmated, playing, up, to, the, checkmate, point, rarely, occurs, in, practice, as, players, normally, resign, as, soon, as, a, loss, is, deemed, inevitable, similarly, if, a, player, were, to, lose, in, an, entering, king, situation, see, section, below, by, having, less, than, 24, points, or, by, any, of, the, other, impasse, rules, used, by, amateurs, then, the, player, will, usually, resign, before, that, point, in, traditional, tournament, play, a, formal, resignation, is, required, that, is, a, checkmate, is, not, a, sufficient, condition, for, winning, the, resignation, is, indicated, by, bowing, and, or, saying, i, lost, makemashita, and, or, placing, the, right, hand, over, the, piece, stands, placing, the, hand, over, the, piece, stand, is, a, vestige, of, an, older, practice, of, gently, dropping, one, s, pieces, in, hand, over, the, board, in, order, to, indicate, resignation, in, western, practice, a, handshake, may, be, used, in, professional, and, serious, tournament, amateur, games, a, player, who, makes, an, illegal, move, loses, immediately, the, loss, stands, even, if, play, continued, and, the, move, was, discovered, later, in, game, however, if, neither, the, opponent, nor, a, third, party, points, out, the, illegal, move, and, the, opponent, later, resigned, the, resignation, stands, as, the, result, illegal, moves, include, in, friendly, amateur, games, this, rule, is, sometimes, relaxed, and, the, player, may, be, able, to, take, back, the, illegal, move, and, replay, a, new, legal, move, in, particular, the, two, pawn, violation, is, the, most, common, illegal, move, played, by, professional, players, the, two, pawn, violation, played, by, takahiro, toyokawa, against, k, suke, tamura, in, the, 2004, nhk, cup, is, infamous, since, it, was, broadcast, on, television, on, the, 109th, move, toyokawa, playing, as, black, dropped, a, pawn, to, the, 29, square, while, he, already, had, a, pawn, in, play, on, the, board, on, the, 23, square, and, thus, lost, the, game, if, the, same, game, position, occurs, four, times, with, the, same, player, to, move, and, the, same, pieces, in, hand, for, each, player, then, the, game, ends, in, a, repetition, draw, sennichite, lit, moves, for, a, thousand, days, as, long, as, the, positions, are, not, due, to, perpetual, check, perpetual, check, is, an, illegal, move, see, above, which, ends, the, game, in, a, loss, in, tournament, play, in, professional, shogi, a, repetition, draw, outcome, is, not, a, final, result, as, draws, essentially, do, not, count, each, game, can, only, end, in, either, a, win, or, loss, in, the, case, of, a, repetition, draw, professional, shogi, players, will, have, to, immediately, play, a, subsequent, game, or, as, many, games, as, necessary, with, sides, reversed, in, order, to, obtain, a, true, win, outcome, that, is, the, player, who, was, white, becomes, black, and, vice, versa, also, depending, on, the, tournament, professional, players, play, the, subsequent, game, in, the, remainder, of, the, allowed, game, time, thus, aiming, for, a, repetition, draw, may, be, a, possible, professional, strategy, for, the, white, player, in, order, to, play, the, second, replay, game, as, black, which, has, a, slight, statistical, advantage, and, or, greater, initiative, for, instance, bishop, exchange, fourth, file, rook, is, a, passive, strategy, for, white, with, the, goal, of, a, repetition, draw, as, it, requires, two, tempo, losses, swinging, the, rook, and, trading, the, bishops, while, it, is, a, very, aggressive, strategy, if, played, by, black, repetition, draws, are, rare, in, professional, shogi, occurring, in, about, 1, 2, of, games, and, even, rarer, in, amateur, games, in, professional, shogi, repetition, draws, usually, occur, in, the, opening, as, certain, positions, are, reached, that, are, theoretically, disadvantaged, for, both, sides, reciprocal, zugzwang, in, amateur, shogi, repetition, draws, tend, to, occur, in, the, middle, or, endgame, as, a, result, of, player, errors, the, game, reaches, an, impasse, or, deadlock, jish, gi, if, both, kings, have, advanced, into, their, respective, promotion, zones, a, situation, known, as, ai, ny, gyoku, double, entering, kings, and, neither, player, can, hope, to, mate, the, other, or, to, gain, any, further, material, an, impasse, can, result, in, either, a, win, or, a, draw, if, an, impasse, happens, the, winner, is, decided, as, follows, each, player, agrees, to, an, impasse, then, each, rook, or, bishop, promoted, or, not, scores, 5, points, for, the, owning, player, and, all, other, pieces, except, kings, score, 1, point, each, a, player, scoring, fewer, than, 24, points, loses, note, that, in, the, start, position, both, players, have, 27, points, each, if, neither, player, has, fewer, than, 24, the, game, is, no, contest, a, draw, in, professional, shogi, an, impasse, result, is, always, a, draw, since, a, player, that, cannot, obtain, the, 24, points, will, simply, resign, jish, gi, is, considered, an, outcome, in, its, own, right, rather, than, no, contest, but, there, is, no, practical, difference, as, an, impasse, needs, to, be, agreed, on, for, the, rule, to, be, invoked, a, player, may, refuse, to, do, so, and, attempt, to, win, the, game, in, future, moves, if, that, happens, there, is, no, official, rule, about, the, verdict, of, the, game, however, in, amateur, shogi, there, are, different, practices, most, of, which, force, a, win, resolution, to, the, impasse, in, order, to, avoid, a, draw, result, the, first, draw, by, impasse, occurred, in, 1731, in, a, bishop, handicap, game, between, the, seventh, lifetime, meijin, s, kan, it, ii, and, his, brother, s, kei, hashi, as, a, practical, matter, when, an, opponent, s, king, has, entered, a, player, s, own, territory, especially, with, supporting, defending, pieces, the, opponent, s, king, is, often, very, difficult, to, mate, given, the, forward, attacking, nature, of, most, shogi, pieces, this, state, is, referred, to, as, entering, king, ny, gyoku, if, both, players, kings, are, in, entering, king, states, the, game, becomes, more, likely, to, result, in, an, impasse, in, the, adjacent, diagram, example, although, white, s, king, is, in, a, strong, bear, in, the, hole, castle, black, s, king, has, entered, white, s, territory, making, it, very, difficult, to, mate, therefore, this, position, favors, black, an, example, of, entering, king, occurred, in, the, fourth, game, of, the, 60th, i, title, match, between, masayuki, toyoshima, and, kazuki, kimura, held, on, august, 20, 21, 2019, after, being, unsuccessful, in, attacking, kimura, and, also, in, defending, his, own, king, within, his, camp, toyoshima, playing, as, white, moved, his, king, away, from, kimura, s, attacking, pieces, by, fleeing, up, the, second, file, ultimately, entering, his, king, into, kimura, s, camp, by, move, 150, although, toyoshima, had, achieved, entering, king, he, still, had, only, 23, points, one, point, shy, of, the, required, 24, points, for, an, impasse, draw, while, kimura, black, had, 31, points, toyoshima, then, spent, the, next, 134, moves, trying, to, bring, his, point, total, which, fluctuated, between, 17, and, 23, up, to, the, necessary, 24, by, the, 231st, move, the, game, had, reached, a, double, entering, kings, state, and, by, move, 285, kimura, had, successfully, kept, toyoshima, s, point, total, at, bay, here, toyoshima, with, 20, points, and, kimura, at, 34, points, resigned, incidentally, this, game, broke, the, record, of, longest, game, in, a, title, match, for, amateur, games, there, are, various, guidances, with, little, standardization, fairbairn, reports, a, practice, in, the, 1980s, considered, a, rule, by, the, now, defunct, shogi, association, for, the, west, where, the, dispute, is, resolved, by, either, player, moving, all, friendly, pieces, into, the, promotion, zone, and, then, the, game, ends, with, points, tallied, another, resolution, is, the, 27, point, 27, rule, used, for, some, amateur, tournaments, one, version, of, this, is, simply, the, player, who, has, 27, or, more, points, is, the, winner, of, the, impasse, another, version, is, a, 27, point, declaration, rule, for, instance, the, declaration, rule, on, the, online, shogi, site, 81dojo, is, that, the, player, who, wants, to, declare, an, impasse, win, must, i, declare, an, intention, to, win, via, impasse, ii, have, the, king, in, the, enemy, camp, the, promotion, zone, for, that, player, iii, 10, other, pieces, must, be, in, the, promotion, zone, iv, not, be, in, check, v, have, time, remaining, and, vi, must, have, 28, points, if, black, or, 27, points, if, white, if, all, of, these, conditions, are, met, then, the, impasse, declarer, will, win, the, game, regardless, of, whether, the, opponent, objects, yet, another, resolution, to, impasse, is, the, so, called, try, rule, torair, ru, in, this, case, after, both, kings, have, entered, their, corresponding, promotion, zones, then, the, player, who, first, moves, the, king, to, the, opponent, s, king, s, start, square, 51, for, black, 59, for, white, first, will, be, the, winner, as, an, example, the, popular, shogi, wars, app, by, heroz, inc, used, the, try, rule, up, until, 2014, now, the, app, uses, a, variant, of, the, 27, point, declaration, rule, although, it, differs, from, the, variant, used, on, the, 81dojo, site, the, idea, of, try, rule, was, taken, from, rugby, football, see, try, rugby, in, professional, tournaments, the, rules, typically, require, drawn, games, to, be, replayed, with, sides, reversed, possibly, with, reduced, time, limits, they, are, rare, compared, to, chess, and, xiangqi, occurring, at, a, rate, of, 1, 2, even, in, amateur, games, the, 1982, meijin, title, match, between, makoto, nakahara, and, hifumi, katoh, was, unusual, in, this, regard, with, an, impasse, draw, in, the, first, double, fortress, game, on, april, 13, 14, only, the, fifth, draw, in, the, then, 40, year, history, of, the, tournament, this, game, with, katoh, as, black, lasted, for, 223, moves, with, 114, minutes, spent, pondering, a, single, move, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, length, of, this, game, was, that, white, nakahara, was, very, close, to, falling, below, the, minimum, of, 24, points, required, for, a, draw, thus, the, end, of, the, endgame, was, strategically, about, trying, to, keep, white, s, points, above, the, 24, point, threshold, in, this, match, sennichite, occurred, in, the, sixth, and, eighth, games, thus, this, best, of, seven, match, lasted, eight, games, and, took, over, three, months, to, finish, black, did, not, lose, a, single, game, and, the, eventual, victor, was, katoh, at, 4, 3, professional, games, are, timed, as, in, international, chess, but, professional, shogi, players, are, almost, never, expected, to, keep, time, in, their, games, instead, a, timekeeper, is, assigned, typically, an, apprentice, professional, time, limits, are, much, longer, than, in, international, chess, 9, hours, a, side, plus, extra, time, in, the, prestigious, meijin, title, match, and, in, addition, by, yomi, literally, second, counting, is, employed, this, means, that, when, the, ordinary, time, has, run, out, the, player, will, from, that, point, on, have, a, certain, amount, of, time, to, complete, every, move, a, by, yomi, period, typically, upwards, of, one, minute, the, final, ten, seconds, are, counted, down, and, if, the, time, expires, the, player, to, move, loses, the, game, immediately, amateurs, often, play, with, electronic, clocks, that, beep, out, the, final, ten, seconds, of, a, by, yomi, period, with, a, prolonged, beep, for, the, last, five, amateur, players, are, ranked, from, 15, ky, to, 1, ky, and, then, from, 1, dan, to, 8, dan, amateur, 8, dan, was, previously, only, honorarily, given, to, famous, people, while, it, is, now, possible, to, win, amateur, 8, dan, by, actual, strength, winning, amateur, ryu, oh, 3, times, this, has, yet, to, be, achieved, professional, players, operate, with, their, own, scale, from, 6, ky, to, 3, dan, for, pro, aspiring, players, and, professional, 4, dan, to, 9, dan, for, formal, professional, players, amateur, and, professional, ranks, are, offset, with, amateur, 4, dan, being, equivalent, to, professional, 6, ky, shogi, has, a, handicap, system, like, go, in, which, games, between, players, of, disparate, strengths, are, adjusted, so, that, the, stronger, player, is, put, in, a, more, disadvantageous, position, in, order, to, compensate, for, the, difference, in, playing, levels, in, a, handicap, game, one, or, more, of, white, s, pieces, are, removed, from, the, setup, and, instead, white, plays, first, the, imbalance, created, by, this, method, of, handicapping, is, not, as, strong, as, it, is, in, western, chess, because, material, advantage, is, not, as, powerful, in, shogi, there, are, two, common, systems, used, to, notate, piece, movements, in, shogi, game, records, one, is, used, in, japanese, language, texts, while, a, second, was, created, for, western, players, by, george, hodges, and, glyndon, townhill, in, the, english, language, this, system, was, updated, by, hosking, to, be, closer, to, the, japanese, standard, two, numerals, other, systems, are, used, to, notate, shogi, board, positions, unlike, chess, the, origin, 11, square, is, at, the, top, right, of, a, printed, position, rather, than, the, bottom, left, in, western, piece, movement, notation, the, format, is, the, piece, initial, followed, by, the, type, of, movement, and, finally, the, file, and, rank, where, the, piece, moved, to, the, piece, initials, are, k, king, r, rook, b, bishop, g, gold, s, silver, n, knight, l, lance, and, p, pawn, simple, movement, is, indicated, with, captures, with, x, and, piece, drops, with, the, files, are, indicated, with, numerals, 1, 9, the, older, hodges, standard, used, letters, a, i, for, ranks, and, the, newer, hosking, standard, also, uses, numerals, 1, 9, for, the, ranks, thus, rx24, indicates, rook, captures, on, 24, promoted, pieces, are, notated, with, prefixed, to, the, piece, initial, e, g, rx24, piece, promotion, is, also, indicated, with, e, g, s, 21, while, unpromotion, is, indicated, with, e, g, s, 21, piece, ambiguity, is, resolved, by, notating, which, square, a, piece, is, moving, from, e, g, n65, 53, means, knight, from, 65, moves, to, 53, and, promotes, which, distinguishes, it, from, n45, 53, the, japanese, notation, system, uses, japanese, characters, for, pieces, and, promotion, indication, and, uses, japanese, numerals, instead, of, letters, for, ranks, movement, type, aside, from, drops, is, not, indicated, and, the, conventions, for, resolving, ambiguity, are, quite, different, from, the, western, system, as, examples, the, western, rx24, would, be, 2, in, japanese, notation, rx24, would, be, 2, s, 21, would, be, 2, s, 21, would, be, 2, and, n65, 53, would, be, 5, showing, that, the, leftmost, knight, jumped, implicitly, from, the, 65, square, which, distinguishes, it, from, 5, in, which, the, rightmost, knight, jumped, although, not, strictly, part, of, the, notational, calculus, for, games, game, results, are, indicated, in, japanese, newspapers, websites, etc, with, wins, indicated, by, a, white, circle, and, losses, indicated, by, a, black, circle, shogi, is, similar, to, chess, but, has, a, much, larger, game, tree, complexity, because, of, the, use, of, drops, greater, number, of, pieces, and, larger, board, size, in, comparison, shogi, games, average, about, 140, half, moves, per, game, or, 70, chess, move, pairs, whereas, chess, games, average, about, 80, moves, per, game, or, 40, chess, move, pairs, and, minishogi, averages, about, 40, moves, per, game, or, 20, chess, move, pairs, like, chess, however, the, game, can, be, divided, into, the, opening, middle, game, and, endgame, each, requiring, a, different, strategy, the, opening, consists, of, arranging, one, s, defenses, usually, in, a, castle, and, positioning, for, attack, the, mid, game, consists, of, attempting, to, break, through, the, opposing, defenses, while, maintaining, one, s, own, and, the, endgame, starts, when, one, side, s, defenses, have, been, compromised, in, the, adjacent, diagram, black, has, chosen, a, ranging, rook, position, specifically, fourth, file, rook, where, the, rook, has, been, moved, leftward, away, from, its, starting, position, additionally, black, is, utilizing, a, silver, crown, castle, which, is, a, type, of, fortification, structure, constructed, with, one, silver, and, two, gold, pieces, and, the, king, moved, inside, of, the, fortification, the, silver, crown, name, comes, from, the, silver, being, positioned, directly, above, the, king, s, head, on, the, 27, square, as, if, it, were, a, crown, in, the, diagram, white, has, chosen, a, static, rook, position, in, which, the, rook, remains, on, its, starting, square, this, static, rook, position, is, specifically, a, type, of, counter, ranging, rook, position, known, as, bear, in, the, hole, static, rook, that, uses, a, bear, in, the, hole, castle, the, bear, in, the, hole, fortification, has, the, king, moved, all, the, way, into, very, edge, corner, of, the, board, on, the, 11, square, as, if, it, were, a, badger, in, a, hole, with, a, silver, moved, to, the, 22, square, in, order, to, close, up, the, hole, and, additional, reinforcing, golds, on, 31, and, 32, squares, this, board, position, required, 33, moves, or, 12, move, pairs, as, counted, in, western, chess, to, construct, shogi, players, are, expected, to, follow, etiquette, in, addition, to, rules, explicitly, described, commonly, accepted, etiquette, include, the, following, shogi, piece, sets, may, contain, two, types, of, king, pieces, king, and, jewel, in, this, case, the, higher, classed, player, in, either, social, or, genuine, shogi, player, rank, may, take, the, king, piece, for, example, in, titleholder, system, games, the, current, titleholder, takes, the, king, piece, as, the, higher, the, higher, ranked, or, older, player, also, sits, facing, the, door, of, the, room, and, is, the, person, who, takes, the, pieces, out, of, the, piece, box, shogi, does, not, have, a, touch, move, rule, as, in, western, chess, tournament, play, or, chu, shogi, however, in, professional, games, a, piece, is, considered, to, be, moved, when, the, piece, has, been, let, go, of, in, both, amateur, and, professional, play, any, piece, may, be, touched, in, order, to, adjust, its, centralization, within, its, square, to, look, tidy, taking, back, moves, matta, in, professional, games, is, prohibited, however, in, friendly, amateur, games, in, japan, it, is, often, permitted, professional, players, are, required, to, follow, several, ritualistic, etiquette, prescriptions, such, as, kneeling, exactly, 15, centimeters, from, the, shogi, board, sitting, in, the, formal, seiza, position, etc, traditionally, the, order, of, placing, the, pieces, on, the, board, is, determined, there, are, two, commonly, used, orders, the, hashi, order, and, the, it, order, placement, sets, pieces, with, multiples, generals, knights, lances, from, left, to, right, in, all, cases, and, follows, the, order, among, amateur, tournaments, the, higher, ranked, player, or, defending, champion, performs, the, piece, toss, in, professional, games, the, furigoma, is, done, on, the, behalf, of, the, higher, ranked, player, champion, by, the, timekeeper, who, kneels, by, the, side, of, the, higher, ranked, player, and, tosses, the, pawn, pieces, onto, a, silk, cloth, in, friendly, amateur, games, a, player, will, ask, the, opponent, to, toss, the, pawns, out, of, politeness, otherwise, the, person, who, tosses, the, pawns, can, be, determined, by, rock, paper, scissors, from, the, chess, variant, pages, the, world, s, first, chess, variant, chaturanga, arose, in, india, in, approximately, the, seventh, century, ad, from, there, it, migrated, both, westward, and, northward, mutating, along, the, way, the, western, branch, became, shatranj, in, arabia, and, orthodox, chess, in, europe, the, northern, branch, became, xiangqi, in, china, and, janggi, in, korea, sometime, in, the, tenth, to, twelfth, centuries, chess, crossed, the, channel, to, japan, where, it, spawned, a, number, of, interesting, variants, one, of, these, was, called, small, shogi, eventually, small, shogi, though, it, went, through, many, forms, won, out, over, the, larger, variants, and, is, now, referred, to, simply, as, shogi, it, is, certain, that, shogi, in, its, present, form, was, played, in, japan, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, it, is, not, clear, when, chess, was, brought, to, japan, the, earliest, generally, accepted, mention, of, shogi, is, shin, saru, gakuki, 1058, 1064, by, fujiwara, akihira, the, oldest, archaeological, evidence, is, a, group, of, 16, shogi, pieces, excavated, from, the, grounds, of, k, fuku, ji, in, nara, prefecture, as, it, was, physically, associated, with, a, wooden, tablet, written, on, in, the, sixth, year, of, tenki, 1058, the, pieces, are, thought, to, date, from, that, period, these, simple, pieces, were, cut, from, a, writing, plaque, in, the, same, five, sided, shape, as, modern, pieces, with, the, names, of, the, pieces, written, on, them, the, dictionary, of, common, folk, culture, nich, reki, c, 1210, 1221, a, collection, based, on, the, two, works, sh, ch, reki, and, kaich, reki, describes, two, forms, of, shogi, large, dai, shogi, and, small, sh, shogi, these, are, now, called, heian, shogi, or, heian, small, shogi, and, heian, dai, shogi, heian, small, shogi, is, the, version, on, which, modern, shogi, is, based, but, the, nich, reki, states, that, one, wins, if, one, s, opponent, is, reduced, to, a, single, king, indicating, that, drops, had, not, yet, been, introduced, according, to, k, ji, shimizu, chief, researcher, at, the, archaeological, institute, of, kashihara, nara, prefecture, the, names, of, the, heian, shogi, pieces, keep, those, of, chaturanga, general, elephant, horse, chariot, and, soldier, and, add, to, them, the, five, treasures, of, buddhism, jade, gold, silver, katsura, tree, and, incense, around, the, 13th, century, the, game, of, dai, shogi, developed, created, by, increasing, the, number, of, pieces, in, heian, shogi, as, was, sho, shogi, which, added, the, rook, bishop, and, drunken, elephant, from, dai, shogi, to, heian, shogi, the, drunken, elephant, steps, one, square, in, any, direction, except, directly, backward, and, promotes, to, the, prince, which, acts, as, a, second, king, and, must, also, be, captured, along, with, the, original, king, for, the, other, player, to, win, around, the, 15th, century, the, rules, of, dai, shogi, were, simplified, creating, the, game, of, chu, shogi, chu, shogi, like, its, parent, dai, shogi, contains, many, distinct, pieces, such, as, the, queen, identical, with, western, chess, and, the, lion, which, moves, like, a, king, but, twice, per, turn, potentially, being, able, to, capture, twice, among, other, idiosyncrasies, the, popularity, of, dai, shogi, soon, waned, in, favour, of, chu, shogi, until, it, stopped, being, played, commonly, chu, shogi, rivalled, sho, shogi, in, popularity, until, the, introduction, of, drops, in, the, latter, upon, which, standard, shogi, became, ascendant, although, chu, shogi, was, still, commonly, played, until, about, world, war, ii, especially, in, kyoto, it, is, thought, that, the, rules, of, standard, shogi, were, fixed, in, the, 16th, century, when, the, drunken, elephant, was, removed, from, the, set, of, pieces, present, in, sho, shogi, there, is, no, clear, record, of, when, drops, were, introduced, however, in, the, edo, period, shogi, variants, were, greatly, expanded, tenjiku, shogi, dai, dai, shogi, maka, dai, dai, shogi, tai, shogi, and, taikyoku, shogi, were, all, invented, it, is, thought, that, these, were, played, to, only, a, very, limited, extent, however, both, standard, shogi, and, go, were, promoted, by, the, tokugawa, shogunate, in, 1612, the, shogunate, passed, a, law, giving, endowments, to, top, shogi, players, meijin, during, the, reign, of, the, eighth, sh, gun, tokugawa, yoshimune, castle, shogi, tournaments, were, held, once, a, year, on, the, 17th, day, of, kannazuki, corresponding, to, november, 17, which, is, shogi, day, on, the, modern, calendar, the, title, of, meijin, became, hereditary, in, the, hashi, and, it, families, until, the, fall, of, the, shogunate, when, it, came, to, be, passed, by, recommendation, today, the, title, is, used, for, the, winner, of, the, meijin, sen, competition, the, first, modern, title, match, from, around, 1899, newspapers, began, to, publish, records, of, shogi, matches, and, high, ranking, players, formed, alliances, with, the, aim, of, having, their, games, published, in, 1909, the, shogi, association, was, formed, and, in, 1924, the, tokyo, shogi, association, was, formed, this, was, an, early, incarnation, of, the, modern, japan, shogi, association, nihon, sh, gi, renmei, or, jsa, and, 1924, is, considered, by, the, jsa, to, be, the, date, it, was, founded, in, 1935, meijin, kinjir, sekine, stepped, down, and, the, rank, of, meijin, came, to, be, awarded, to, the, winner, of, a, meijin, title, match, meijin, sen, yoshio, kimura, became, the, first, meijin, under, this, system, in, 1937, this, was, the, start, of, the, shogi, title, matches, see, titleholder, system, after, the, war, other, tournaments, were, promoted, to, title, matches, culminating, with, the, ry, title, match, ry, sen, in, 1988, for, the, modern, line, up, of, seven, about, 200, professional, shogi, players, compete, each, year, the, title, holder, defends, the, title, against, a, challenger, chosen, from, knockout, or, round, matches, after, the, second, world, war, scap, occupational, government, mainly, led, by, us, tried, to, eliminate, all, feudal, factors, from, japanese, society, and, shogi, was, included, in, the, possible, list, of, items, to, be, banned, along, with, bushido, philosophy, of, samurai, and, other, things, scap, s, reason, for, banning, shogi, was, that, the, game, uniquely, utilized, captured, pieces, scap, insisted, that, this, could, lead, to, the, idea, of, prisoner, abuse, kozo, masuda, then, one, of, the, top, professional, shogi, players, when, summoned, to, the, scap, headquarters, for, an, investigation, criticized, such, understanding, of, shogi, instead, insisting, that, chess, that, potentially, contained, the, idea, of, prisoner, abuse, because, opposing, pieces, are, removed, permanently, while, shogi, gives, prisoners, the, chance, to, get, back, into, the, game, masuda, also, argued, that, chess, contradicts, the, ideal, of, gender, equality, in, western, society, because, the, king, shields, itself, behind, the, queen, and, runs, away, masuda, s, assertions, are, said, to, have, eventually, led, to, the, exemption, of, shogi, from, the, list, of, items, to, be, banned, there, are, two, organizations, for, shogi, professional, players, in, japan, the, jsa, and, the, ladies, professional, shogi, players, association, of, japan, nihon, joshi, puro, sh, gi, ky, kai, or, lpsa, the, jsa, is, the, primary, organization, for, men, and, women, s, professional, shogi, while, the, lpsa, is, a, group, of, women, professionals, who, broke, away, from, the, jsa, in, 2007, to, establish, their, own, independent, organization, both, organize, tournaments, for, their, members, and, have, reached, an, agreement, to, cooperate, with, each, other, to, promote, shogi, through, events, and, other, activities, top, professional, players, are, fairly, well, paid, from, tournament, earnings, in, 2016, the, highest, tournament, earners, were, yoshiharu, habu, and, akira, watanabe, who, earned, 91, 500, 000, and, 73, 900, 000, the, tenth, highest, earner, kouichi, fukaura, won, 18, 490, 000, the, jsa, recognizes, two, categories, of, shogi, professionals, professional, kishi, and, female, professional, jory, kishi, sometimes, kishi, are, addressed, as, seikishi, a, term, from, go, used, to, distinguish, kishi, from, other, classes, of, players, jsa, professional, ranks, and, female, professional, ranks, are, not, equivalent, and, each, has, their, own, promotion, criteria, and, ranking, system, in, 2006, the, jsa, officially, granted, women, professional, status, this, is, not, equivalent, however, to, the, more, traditional, way, of, gaining, professional, status, i, e, being, promoted, from, the, shoreikai, system, leagues, of, strong, amateur, players, aspiring, to, become, a, professional, rather, it, is, a, separate, system, especially, designed, for, female, professionals, qualified, amateurs, regardless, of, gender, may, apply, for, the, shoreikai, system, and, all, those, who, successfully, graduate, are, granted, kishi, status, however, no, woman, has, yet, to, accomplish, this, feat, the, highest, women, have, reached, is, shoreikai, 3, dan, league, by, kana, satomi, and, tomoka, nishiyama, so, kishi, is, de, facto, only, used, to, refer, to, male, shogi, professionals, the, jsa, is, the, only, body, which, can, organize, tournaments, for, professionals, e, g, the, eight, major, tournaments, in, the, titleholder, system, and, other, professional, tournaments, in, 1996, yoshiharu, habu, became, the, only, kishi, to, hold, seven, major, titles, at, the, same, time, for, female, professionals, both, the, jsa, and, lpsa, organize, tournaments, either, jointly, or, separately, tournaments, for, amateurs, may, be, organized, by, the, jsa, and, lpsa, as, well, as, local, clubs, newspapers, private,

outside, japan, particularly, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, especially, in, shanghai, the, january, 2006, edition, of, kindai, shogi, stated, that, there, were, 120, 000, shogi,
