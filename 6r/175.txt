various, cultures, each, characterized, by, unique, principles, and, implications, forced, marriage, entails, coercion, where, one, or, both, parties, are, compelled, into, marriage, against, their, will, often, through, emotional, manipulation, threats, or, physical, violence, this, practice, disregards, individual, autonomy, and, consent, leading, to, profound, emotional, distress, and, violation, of, human, rights, in, contrast, arranged, marriage, involves, familial, or, societal, intervention, in, selecting, a, spouse, for, one, or, both, individuals, based, on, cultural, religious, or, social, considerations, however, the, consent, of, the, individuals, involved, remains, most, important, in, arranged, marriages, distinguishing, them, from, forced, unions, arranged, marriages, may, involve, input, from, the, prospective, spouses, allowing, them, a, degree, of, agency, in, the, process, although, within, the, framework, of, familial, or, societal, expectations, thus, while, both, forced, and, arranged, marriages, involve, external, influences, in, partner, selection, the, pivotal, disparity, lies, in, the, presence, or, absence, of, consent, underscoring, the, ethical, and, moral, implications, inherent, in, each, practice, within, a, news, article, professor, burns, the, anti, slavery, australia, diretor, states, arranged, marriages, are, widely, practiced, in, australia, and, there, are, many, people, who, have, been, married, after, being, introduced, by, a, family, member, or, member, of, the, community, but, ultimately, the, couple, decides, whether, they, want, to, marry, a, forced, marriage, is, the, opposite, there, is, no, complete, and, free, consent, kassis, 2023, ultimately, the, critical, distinction, between, forced, and, arranged, marriages, lies, in, the, presence, or, absence, of, consent, forced, marriage, represents, a, violation, of, individual, autonomy, and, human, rights, characterized, by, coercion, and, lack, of, consent, in, contrast, arranged, marriage, when, conducted, ethically, and, with, respect, for, the, agency, of, the, individuals, involved, can, offer, a, pathway, to, union, that, aligns, with, cultural, and, familial, values, while, still, honoring, the, importance, of, consent, and, personal, choice, for, matchmakers, traditionally, called, nayan, in, india, it, is, customary, for, them, to, be, a, family, friend, or, a, distant, relative, some, people, however, do, not, prefer, to, use, a, matchmaker, as, stated, by, santana, flanigan, some, families, with, marriageable, age, children, may, prefer, not, to, approach, possible, matches, with, a, marriage, proposal, because, communication, between, families, could, break, down, and, could, result, in, accidental, disrespect, between, the, two, families, this, person, is, a, neutral, matchmaker, when, families, are, trying, to, plan, an, arranged, marriage, the, nayan, usually, has, two, roles, that, they, play, one, is, as, a, marriage, scout, and, the, other, is, as, a, negotiator, as, a, marriage, scout, the, matchmaker, goes, out, into, the, community, and, tries, to, find, a, potential, match, for, the, person, who, wants, to, get, married, as, a, negotiator, the, matchmaker, talks, to, different, families, and, tries, to, come, to, a, common, ground, about, a, potential, arranged, marriage, between, two, families, while, going, about, this, process, the, matchmaker, takes, into, account, several, different, considerations, including, but, not, limited, to, family, background, financial, status, and, family, reputation, once, the, nayan, finds, a, match, they, will, get, in, contact, with, the, families, and, start, to, arrange, communication, between, the, future, couple, communication, starts, strictly, from, the, matchmaker, to, the, two, people, and, their, families, eventually, families, will, begin, to, communicate, with, each, other, while, also, allowing, the, new, couple, to, communicate, with, one, another, after, the, families, have, talked, about, the, marriage, and, made, wedding, plans, the, matchmakers, come, back, to, help, in, the, process, of, the, wedding, the, help, offered, by, the, nayan, can, come, in, the, form, of, jewelry, or, wedding, setup, usually, the, matchmaker, does, not, receive, any, pay, for, the, work, that, they, have, done, but, will, often, be, given, gifts, from, the, families, of, the, new, couple, over, human, history, through, modern, times, the, practice, of, arranged, marriages, has, been, encouraged, by, a, combination, of, factors, such, as, the, practice, of, child, marriage, late, marriage, tradition, culture, religion, poverty, and, limited, choice, disabilities, wealth, and, inheritance, issues, politics, social, and, ethnic, conflicts, child, marriage, does, not, prepare, or, provide, the, individual, much, opportunity, to, make, an, informed, free, choice, about, matrimony, they, are, implicitly, arranged, marriages, in, rural, areas, of, east, asia, sub, saharan, africa, south, asia, and, latin, america, poverty, and, lack, of, options, such, as, being, able, to, attend, school, leave, little, choice, to, children, other, than, be, in, early, arranged, marriages, child, marriages, are, primarily, seen, in, areas, of, poverty, parents, arrange, child, marriages, to, ensure, their, child, s, financial, security, and, reinforce, social, ties, they, believe, it, offers, protection, and, reduces, the, daughter, s, economic, burden, on, the, family, due, to, how, costly, it, is, to, feed, clothe, and, optionally, educate, a, girl, by, marrying, their, daughter, to, a, good, family, the, parents, improve, their, social, status, by, establishing, a, social, bond, between, each, other, according, to, warner, in, nations, with, the, high, rates, of, child, marriages, the, marriage, of, the, girl, is, almost, always, arranged, by, her, parents, or, guardians, the, nations, with, the, highest, rates, of, arranged, child, marriages, are, niger, chad, mali, bangladesh, guinea, central, african, republic, afghanistan, yemen, india, and, pakistan, arranged, child, marriages, are, also, observed, in, parts, of, the, americas, in, impoverished, communities, every, adult, mouth, to, feed, becomes, a, continuing, burden, in, many, of, these, cultures, women, have, difficulty, finding, gainful, employment, or, are, simply, prohibited, from, doing, so, and, their, daughters, become, the, greatest, burden, to, the, family, some, scholars, argue, that, arranging, a, marriage, of, a, daughter, becomes, a, necessary, means, to, reduce, this, burden, poverty, stemming, from, poor, decisions, therefore, is, a, consequent, driver, of, arranged, marriage, this, theory, is, supported, by, the, observed, rapid, drop, in, arranged, marriages, in, fast, growing, economies, of, asia, the, financial, benefit, parents, receive, from, their, working, single, daughters, has, been, cited, as, a, reason, for, their, growing, reluctance, to, see, their, daughters, marry, at, too, early, an, age, late, marriage, particularly, past, the, age, of, 30, years, old, reduces, the, pool, of, available, women, for, autonomous, marriages, introductions, and, arranged, marriages, become, a, productive, option, for, example, in, part, due, to, economic, prosperity, about, 40, of, modern, japanese, women, reach, the, age, of, 29, and, have, never, been, married, to, assist, late, marriages, the, traditional, custom, of, arranged, marriages, called, miai, kekkon, is, re, emerging, it, involves, the, prospective, bride, and, groom, family, friends, and, a, matchmaker, nak, do, the, pair, is, selected, by, a, process, with, the, individuals, and, family, involved, iegara, typically, the, couple, meets, three, times, in, public, or, private, before, deciding, if, they, want, to, get, engaged, migrant, minority, ethnic, populations, have, limited, choice, of, partners, particularly, when, they, are, stereotyped, segregated, or, avoided, by, the, majority, population, this, encourages, homogamy, and, arranged, marriages, within, the, ethnic, group, examples, of, this, dynamic, include, sikh, marriages, between, 1910, and, 1980, in, canada, arranged, marriages, among, hasidic, jews, and, arranged, marriages, among, japanese, american, immigrants, before, the, 1960s, who, would, travel, back, to, japan, to, marry, the, spouse, arranged, by, the, family, and, then, return, married, in, other, cases, a, girl, from, japan, would, arrive, in, the, united, states, as, a, picture, bride, pre, arranged, to, marry, the, japanese, american, man, on, arrival, whom, she, had, never, met, arranged, marriage, may, be, the, consequence, of, certain, customs, for, example, in, rural, and, tribal, parts, of, pakistan, and, afghanistan, disputes, unpaid, debts, in, default, and, crimes, such, as, murder, are, settled, by, a, council, of, village, elders, called, jirga, a, typical, punishment, for, a, crime, committed, by, males, involves, requiring, the, guilty, family, to, marry, their, virgin, girls, between, 5, and, 12, year, old, to, the, other, family, this, custom, requires, no, consent, from, the, girl, or, even, her, parents, such, arranged, child, marriages, are, called, vani, swara, and, sak, in, different, regional, languages, of, pakistan, another, custom, in, certain, islamic, nations, such, as, pakistan, is, watta, satta, where, a, brother, sister, pair, of, one, family, are, swapped, as, spouses, for, a, brother, sister, pair, of, another, family, in, other, words, the, wife, is, also, the, sister, in, law, for, the, males, in, two, families, this, custom, inherently, leads, to, arranged, form, of, marriage, about, 30, of, all, marriages, in, western, rural, regions, of, pakistan, are, by, custom, watta, satta, marriages, and, 75, of, these, muslim, marriages, are, between, cousins, and, other, blood, relatives, some, immigrant, families, prefer, customary, practice, of, arranged, marriage, arranged, marriages, across, feudal, lords, city, states, and, kingdoms, as, a, means, of, establishing, political, alliances, trade, and, peace, were, common, in, human, history, when, a, king, married, his, son, to, a, neighboring, state, s, daughter, it, indicated, an, alliance, among, equals, and, signaled, the, former, s, state, superiority, for, example, the, fourth, daughter, of, maria, theresa, archduchess, of, austria, and, queen, of, hungary, marie, antoinette, married, the, dauphin, crown, prince, of, france, who, would, become, king, louis, xvi, politics, within, arranged, marriages, can, manifest, through, negotiating, and, navigating, familial, societal, and, cultural, expectations, surrounding, the, union, in, many, cultures, where, arranged, marriages, are, prevalent, considerations, such, as, family, status, wealth, social, connections, and, even, political, alliances, may, influence, the, selection, of, a, spouse, the, decision, making, process, often, involves, the, individuals, directly, involved, and, their, families, who, may, seek, to, align, the, marriage, with, their, interests, and, aspirations, on, the, other, hand, an, article, within, the, wire, states, the, financial, aspect, on, the, other, hand, is, a, newer, addition, which, entails, a, girl, s, professional, ambitions, and, earning, capacity, it, is, because, a, greater, number, of, indian, women, are, pursuing, professional, degrees, and, subsequent, employment, more, importantly, due, to, a, rise, in, the, standard, of, living, of, an, average, indian, middle, class, couple, that, it, has, become, essential, for, both, spouses, to, earn, however, a, word, of, caution, doing, the, rounds, within, the, groom, community, is, that, ambition, combined, with, financial, independence, is, a, lethal, combination, hence, it, is, essential, to, nip, it, in, the, bud, dhoop, 2018, additionally, political, factors, outside, the, immediate, family, sphere, such, as, community, dynamics, or, broader, societal, norms, can, further, shape, the, parameters, of, arranged, marriages, consequently, the, power, influence, and, negotiation, dynamics, within, arranged, marriages, can, reflect, complex, interplays, between, personal, desires, familial, expectations, and, external, pressures, underscoring, the, intricate, relationship, between, marriage, and, politics, in, diverse, cultural, contexts, moreover, arranged, marriages, can, intersect, with, political, ideologies, particularly, in, contexts, where, cultural, traditions, intersect, with, state, policies, in, societies, where, arranged, marriages, are, deeply, entrenched, governments, may, seek, to, regulate, or, promote, such, unions, as, a, means, of, preserving, cultural, identity, or, social, cohesion, conversely, movements, advocating, for, individual, rights, and, autonomy, may, challenge, the, practice, of, arranged, marriages, framing, it, as, an, infringement, on, personal, freedom, and, agency, the, interplay, between, political, ideologies, state, interventions, and, cultural, practices, can, profoundly, shape, the, dynamics, of, arranged, marriages, influencing, everything, from, the, selection, process, to, the, power, dynamics, within, the, marital, relationship, in, essence, politics, within, arranged, marriages, encompass, a, multifaceted, interplay, of, personal, familial, societal, and, geopolitical, factors, shaping, the, dynamics, and, outcomes, of, these, unions, in, complex, ways, understanding, the, political, dimensions, of, arranged, marriages, requires, an, appreciation, of, the, broader, social, cultural, and, historical, contexts, in, which, they, occur, highlighting, the, intricate, interconnections, between, marriage, power, and, politics, in, japan, many, people, find, it, very, difficult, to, find, a, potential, future, spouse, so, they, have, their, parents, arrange, a, marriage, for, them, every, so, often, a, matchmaking, agency, called, matchmaking, agency, association, of, parents, of, marriage, proposal, information, holds, an, event, for, young, people, in, japan, who, are, looking, for, their, future, spouses, this, event, costs, the, parents, of, these, young, adults, 14, 000, yen, or, 96, to, attend, which, is, expensive, with, housing, being, so, expensive, a, low, income, economy, and, the, demanding, work, culture, going, against, people, in, japan, fewer, japanese, people, want, to, get, married, and, have, children, lau, fukutome, 2023, the, economic, pressures, coupled, with, societal, shifts, towards, individualism, and, career, focused, lifestyles, have, led, to, a, declining, interest, in, marriage, and, child, rearing, among, the, younger, generation, in, japan, some, parents, are, spooked, at, the, thought, of, paying, for, their, children, to, attend, these, events, to, make, sure, they, can, marry, a, higher, class, citizen, to, have, a, better, marriage, and, life, together, these, parents, want, what, is, best, for, their, children, and, if, it, means, having, to, arrange, a, marriage, for, them, so, be, it, arranged, marriages, remain, very, common, in, many, parts, of, the, world, including, japan, while, the, practice, has, evolved, significantly, over, time, moving, away, from, strictly, familial, arrangements, towards, a, more, relaxed, way, of, getting, to, know, one, another, and, mutual, consent, its, presence, in, modern, society, continues, modern, arranged, marriages, often, incorporate, elements, of, personal, choice, and, freedom, with, the, opportunities, to, interact, date, and, build, relationships, before, committing, to, marriage, arranged, marriages, happen, all, over, the, world, every, day, and, they, are, still, very, prevalent, in, society, whether, we, acknowledge, it, or, not, although, arranged, marriages, have, changed, dramatically, throughout, the, years, they, still, exist, and, have, come, a, long, way, throughout, most, of, human, history, marriage, has, been, a, social, institution, that, produced, children, and, organized, inheritance, of, property, from, one, generation, to, next, various, cultures, particularly, some, wealthy, royals, and, aristocratic, families, arranged, marriages, in, part, to, conserve, or, streamline, the, inheritance, of, their, wealth, tongyangxi, also, known, as, shim, pua, marriage, in, taiwanese, literally, child, or, little, daughter, in, law, was, a, tradition, of, arranged, marriage, in, which, a, poor, family, would, arrange, and, marry, a, pre, adolescent, daughter, into, a, richer, family, as, a, servant, the, little, girl, provided, slave, like, free, labor, and, also, the, daughter, in, law, to, the, adoptive, family, s, son, this, sort, of, arranged, marriage, in, theory, enabled, the, girl, to, escape, poverty, and, the, wealthy, family, to, get, free, labor, and, a, daughter, in, law, zhaozhui, was, a, related, custom, by, which, a, wealthy, family, that, lacked, an, heir, would, arrange, marriage, of, a, boy, child, from, another, family, the, boy, would, move, in, with, the, wealthy, family, take, on, the, surname, of, the, new, family, and, marry, the, family, s, daughter, such, arranged, marriages, helped, maintain, inheritance, bloodlines, similar, matrilocal, arranged, marriages, to, preserve, wealth, inheritance, were, common, in, korea, japan, and, other, parts, of, the, world, a, dowry, is, a, gift, of, money, property, or, valuable, items, gifted, to, a, groom, by, the, bride, s, family, after, marriage, as, stated, by, santana, flanigan, dowries, originally, started, as, love, gifts, after, the, marriages, of, upper, caste, individuals, but, during, the, medieval, period, the, demands, for, dowries, became, a, precursor, for, marriage, the, dowry, system, apart, from, being, sexist, also, has, other, negative, side, effects, in, many, instances, the, families, of, women, can, not, afford, to, put, up, a, dowry, for, their, daughters, this, can, cause, the, daughter, not, to, get, married, which, in, turn, in, severe, cases, can, lead, to, suicide, or, depression, when, a, family, can, not, afford, a, dowry, for, their, daughters, this, as, well, can, make, the, daughter, feel, like, a, financial, burden, to, the, family, as, a, result, of, these, negative, side, effects, a, law, was, passed, in, 1961, this, law, was, called, the, dowry, prohibition, act, of, 1961, and, was, passed, in, india, the, act, of, 1961, made, it, illegal, for, a, family, to, demand, give, or, take, a, dowry, and, if, caught, they, could, be, punished, by, law, however, this, act, has, some, loose, knots, in, terms, of, its, rules, it, is, stated, that, the, couple, is, allowed, to, have, a, wedding, present, in, the, form, of, money, clothes, or, other, things, that, do, not, count, as, a, dowry, it, also, states, that, if, a, family, does, decide, to, give, a, dowry, it, does, not, invalidate, the, marriage, and, no, legal, issues, will, be, taken, unless, they, get, caught, therefore, giving, a, dowry, is, illegal, by, law, but, many, people, still, find, ways, to, give, them, they, found, these, ways, by, finding, the, loopholes, in, the, dowry, prohibition, act, of, 1961, for, example, the, family, will, gift, gifts, of, large, sums, of, money, to, the, couple, as, a, wedding, gift, this, money, to, some, may, be, seen, as, a, dowry, and, since, giving, money, as, a, wedding, gift, is, allowed, this, may, be, considered, a, loophole, according, to, lodhia, at, britannica, in, 1984, it, was, changed, to, specify, that, presents, given, to, a, bride, or, a, groom, at, the, time, of, a, wedding, are, allowed, this, correction, to, the, dowry, prohibition, act, of, 1961, made, things, more, specific, the, corrections, made, it, so, that, when, the, married, couple, received, wedding, gifts, they, had, to, document, the, gift, who, gave, it, to, them, the, relation, of, the, person, to, the, couple, and, how, much, the, gift, was, worth, this, made, it, easier, to, track, if, a, couple, did, receive, a, dowry, versus, if, it, was, a, wedding, gift, after, 1984, even, more, additions, were, made, in, the, indian, penal, code, modifications, were, made, to, help, female, victims, of, dowry, related, violence, dowry, related, violence, is, when, the, groom, s, family, demands, a, dowry, from, the, bride, s, family, before, during, or, after, the, marriage, these, acts, of, violence, only, affect, the, women, in, the, marriage, and, can, often, be, very, brutal, according, to, the, advocates, for, human, rights, the, most, common, forms, of, dowry, related, violence, are, physical, violence, marital, rape, acid, attacks, and, wife, burning, where, a, woman, is, covered, in, kerosene, or, some, other, accelerant, and, deliberately, set, on, fire, these, violent, attacks, result, from, the, bride, s, family, not, wanting, to, or, being, unable, to, pay, a, dowry, that, the, groom, s, family, has, demanded, in, many, cultures, particularly, in, parts, of, africa, and, the, middle, east, daughters, are, valuable, on, the, marriage, market, because, the, groom, and, his, family, have, to, not, must, pay, cash, or, property, for, the, right, to, marry, the, daughter, this, is, referred, to, as, bride, wealth, or, by, various, names, such, as, lobola, and, wine, carrying, the, bride, wealth, is, typically, kept, by, the, bride, s, family, after, the, marriage, and, is, a, source, of, income, to, poor, families, the, brother, s, father, and, male, relatives, of, the, bride, typically, take, keen, interest, in, arranging, her, marriage, to, a, man, who, is, willing, to, pay, the, most, wealth, in, exchange, for, the, right, to, marry, her, some, religious, denominations, recognize, marriages, only, within, the, faith, of, the, major, religions, of, the, world, islam, forbids, marriage, of, girls, of, a, devout, parent, to, a, man, who, does, not, belong, to, that, religion, in, other, words, islam, forbids, marriage, of, muslim, girls, to, non, muslim, men, and, the, religious, punishment, for, those, who, marry, outside, might, be, severe, this, is, one, of, the, motivations, of, arranged, marriages, in, islamic, minority, populations, in, europe, arranged, marriage, is, practiced, by, members, of, the, apostolic, christian, church, an, anabaptist, denomination, of, christianity, the, marriage, process, in, the, apostolic, christian, church, begins, with, a, brother, in, the, faith, deciding, that, it, is, time, for, him, to, be, married, the, brother, makes, it, a, matter, of, prayer, that, god, will, show, him, who, is, to, be, his, wife, once, a, sister, in, the, faith, is, selected, the, brother, speaks, to, his, father, about, it, with, the, father, s, blessing, the, brother, then, takes, his, proposal, to, the, elder, or, leader, of, his, local, church, if, the, local, elder, feels, the, request, is, reasonable, and, that, the, brother, s, spiritual, life, is, in, order, he, will, forward, the, request, to, the, elder, of, the, prospective, bride, s, church, if, this, elder, feels, that, the, request, is, reasonable, and, that, their, spiritual, lives, are, in, order, then, the, proposal, is, forwarded, to, the, father, of, the, prospective, bride, if, the, father, is, in, agreement, then, the, proposal, is, forwarded, to, the, sister, in, the, faith, she, is, to, them, make, it, a, matter, of, prayer, to, determine, if, it, is, god, s, will, that, she, marry, this, brother, in, the, faith, if, she, agrees, then, the, proposal, is, announced, to, their, respective, home, churches, marriages, generally, follow, short, engagement, periods, as, strict, church, discipline, including, excommunication, is, applied, to, those, who, have, premarital, relations, since, religion, is, important, in, the, hindu, community, parents, often, find, spouses, that, have, the, same, religion, for, their, children, when, two, people, with, different, religions, fall, in, love, one, must, convert, to, the, other, s, religion, forsaking, their, own, it, is, socially, unacceptable, for, people, to, intermarry, which, is, why, parents, arranging, a, marriage, for, their, children, will, make, sure, they, marry, someone, from, the, same, faith, hindus, favor, religious, segregation, so, many, of, them, do, not, keep, friendships, with, those, from, other, religions, a, study, shows, that, 45, of, hindus, only, have, friends, who, have, the, same, religion, as, them, and, 13, percent, have, friends, with, different, religions, this, trains, children, to, only, desire, to, be, around, those, of, the, same, religion, since, intermingling, of, religious, friendships, and, marriages, are, not, too, common, furthermore, the, people, must, marry, within, their, caste, system, and, most, have, a, specific, type, of, religion, they, are, taught, this, from, a, young, age, and, it, is, considered, one, of, the, most, important, rules, when, love, outside, of, a, person, s, caste, happens, the, parents, sometimes, threaten, to, kill, the, lover, families, fear, of, the, opinions, of, the, public, is, another, reason, why, parents, forbid, their, children, from, marrying, outside, their, caste, the, lowest, known, as, the, untouchables, are, seen, as, unclean, and, they, are, not, even, allowed, to, walk, past, someone, from, a, higher, caste, because, of, fear, that, they, will, defile, them, arranged, marriages, are, actively, debated, amongst, scholars, as, many, question, whether, arranged, marriages, are, being, used, to, abuse, the, international, immigration, system, arranged, marriages, can, also, be, seen, as, an, inherent, violation, to, human, rights, particularly, women, s, rights, scholars, often, wonder, if, arranged, marriages, are, more, stable, and, suitable, for, raising, children, and, question, whether, the, married, couple, can, still, experience, a, loving, respectful, relationship, in, the, united, kingdom, public, discussion, has, questioned, whether, international, arranged, marriages, are, carried, out, without, the, couple, s, intention, to, live, together, they, suspect, that, some, arranged, marriages, are, born, out, of, the, intention, to, gift, residency, and, european, citizenship, to, immigrants, who, would, otherwise, be, denied, a, visa, to, enter, the, country, these, fears, have, been, further, stoked, by, observed, divorces, once, the, minimum, married, residence, period, requirement, is, met, mp, ann, cryer, has, alleged, examples, of, such, abuse, by, west, asian, muslim, families, in, her, motion, to, the, uk, s, house, of, commons, the, united, states, has, seen, a, similar, controversy, with, sham, arranged, marriages, various, international, organizations, including, unicef, have, campaigned, for, laws, to, ban, arranged, marriages, of, children, as, well, as, forced, marriages, article, 15, and, 16, of, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, cedaw, specifically, cover, marriage, and, family, law, which, support, such, a, ban, arranged, marriages, are, a, matter, of, debate, and, disagreements, activists, such, as, charlotte, bunch, suggest, that, marriages, arranged, by, parents, and, other, family, members, typically, assume, heterosexual, preference, and, involve, emotional, pressure, this, drives, some, individuals, into, marriages, that, they, consent, to, under, duress, bunch, suggests, that, all, marriages, should, be, autonomous, in, contrast, preventing, arranged, marriages, may, harm, many, individuals, who, want, to, get, married, and, can, benefit, from, parental, participation, in, finding, and, selecting, a, mate, for, example, willoughby, suggests, that, arranged, marriages, work, because, they, remove, anxiety, from, the, process, of, finding, a, spouse, parents, families, and, friends, provide, an, independent, perspective, when, they, participate, in, learning, and, evaluating, the, other, person, s, history, and, behavior, as, well, as, the, couple, s, mutual, compatibility, willoughby, further, suggests, that, parents, and, family, members, provide, more, than, input, in, the, screening, and, selection, process, often, they, provide, financial, support, for, the, wedding, housing, emotional, support, and, other, valuable, resources, for, the, couple, as, they, navigate, married, life, like, childcare, michael, rosenfeld, asserts, that, the, differences, between, autonomous, marriages, and, arranged, marriages, are, empirically, small, many, people, meet, date, and, choose, to, marry, or, cohabit, with, those, who, are, similar, in, background, age, interests, and, social, class, they, feel, most, similar, to, screening, factors, most, parents, would, have, used, for, them, anyway, assuming, the, pool, from, which, mates, are, screened, and, selected, is, large, rosenfeld, suggests, that, the, differences, between, the, two, approaches, to, marriages, are, not, as, great, as, some, imagine, them, to, be, others, have, expressed, sentiments, similar, to, rosenfeld, the, united, states, has, some, very, clean, and, concrete, laws, about, arranged, and, forced, marriages, according, to, the, united, states, citizenship, and, immigration, services, forced, marriage, can, happen, to, individuals, of, any, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sex, age, immigration, status, or, national, origin, it, can, happen, to, individuals, from, any, economic, or, educational, background, this, usually, happens, because, of, religious, cultural, or, social, status, reasons, in, most, cases, the, families, of, both, parties, feel, that, the, two, people, should, get, married, for, many, different, reasons, but, the, participants, who, are, to, be, married, do, not, want, to, get, married, in, the, united, states, forced, marriages, are, not, permitted, at, all, and, can, be, grounds, for, prosecution, according, to, the, united, states, citizenship, and, immigration, services, in, all, u, s, states, people, who, force, someone, to, marry, may, be, charged, with, violating, state, laws, including, those, against, domestic, violence, child, abuse, rape, assault, kidnapping, threats, of, violence, stalking, or, coercion, in, an, arranged, marriage, the, families, of, the, individuals, help, to, choose, the, marriage, partner, but, overall, will, not, force, marriage, upon, anyone, if, they, do, not, want, to, get, married, the, role, of, family, members, and, their, degree, of, involvement, therefore, is, often, used, to, distinguish, between, an, arranged, marriage, and, a, forced, marriage, for, forced, marriages, the, family, plays, a, part, in, choosing, the, individual, the, person, will, marry, and, the, participant, has, no, agency, in, the, matter, the, united, states, government, is, against, forced, marriage, and, sees, it, as, a, human, rights, abuse, divorce, rates, have, climbed, in, the, european, union, and, the, united, states, with, increase, in, autonomous, marriage, rates, the, lowest, divorce, rates, in, the, world, are, in, cultures, with, high, rates, of, arranged, marriages, such, as, the, amish, culture, of, the, united, states, 1, hindus, of, india, 3, and, ultra, orthodox, jews, of, israel, 7, according, to, a, 2012, study, by, statistic, brain, 53, 25, of, marriages, are, arranged, worldwide, the, global, divorce, rate, for, arranged, marriages, was, 6, 3, which, could, be, an, indicator, for, the, success, rate, of, arranged, marriages, this, has, led, scholars, to, ask, if, arranged, marriages, are, more, stable, than, autonomous, marriages, and, whether, this, stability, matters, others, suggest, that, the, low, divorce, rate, may, not, reflect, stability, but, that, it, instead, illustrates, the, difficulty, of, the, divorce, process, furthermore, individuals, may, experience, social, ostracism, upon, divorce, leading, them, to, choose, to, live, in, a, dysfunctional, marriage, rather, than, face, the, consequences, of, a, divorce, also, the, perception, of, high, divorce, rates, attributed, to, self, arranged, marriages, in, the, united, states, is, being, called, into, question, various, small, sample, surveys, have, been, performed, to, ascertain, if, arranged, marriages, or, autonomous, marriages, have, a, more, satisfying, married, life, the, results, are, mixed, some, state, marriage, satisfaction, is, higher, in, autonomous, marriages, while, others, find, no, significant, differences, johnson, and, bachan, have, questioned, the, small, sample, size, and, conclusions, derived, from, them, scholars, ask, whether, love, and, respect, in, marital, life, is, greater, in, arranged, marriages, than, autonomous, marriages, epstein, suggests, that, in, many, arranged, marriages, love, emerges, over, time, neither, autonomous, nor, arranged, marriages, offer, any, guarantees, many, arranged, marriages, also, end, up, being, cold, and, dysfunctional, as, well, with, reports, of, abuse, in, some, cultures, where, arranged, marriages, are, common, there, is, a, higher, inequality, between, men, and, women, some, believe, that, those, in, arranged, marriages, might, have, a, more, satisfying, union, since, they, have, realistic, expectations, and, are, not, clouded, by, emotion, when, going, into, the, marriage, others, believe, the, arrangement, can, lead, to, unhappiness, and, discontentment, in, the, marriage, although, people, who, are, in, autonomous, marriages, may, look, at, arranged, marriages, as, forced, results, have, shown, that, many, people, enter, arranged, marriages, of, their, own, free, will, according, to, one, study, the, divorce, rate, was, 4, for, arranged, marriages, while, in, the, u, s, 40, of, autonomous, marriages, ended, in, divorce, there, have, also, been, questions, about, sexual, gratification, in, japan, it, was, reported, that, the, men, in, arranged, marriages, were, more, sexually, satisfied, while, in, autonomous, marriages, the, partners, experienced, roughly, the, same, amount, of, satisfaction, in, india, there, showed, to, be, an, equal, amount, of, compassionate, love, shown, between, arranged, marriages, and, autonomous, marriages
