ten, pin, bowling, is, a, type, of, bowling, in, which, a, bowler, rolls, a, bowling, ball, down, a, wood, or, synthetic, lane, toward, ten, pins, positioned, evenly, in, four, rows, in, an, equilateral, triangle, the, goal, is, to, knock, down, all, ten, pins, on, the, first, roll, of, the, ball, a, strike, or, failing, that, on, the, second, roll, a, spare, while, most, people, approach, modern, ten, pin, bowling, as, a, simple, recreational, pastime, those, who, bowl, competitively, especially, at, the, highest, levels, consider, it, a, demanding, sport, requiring, precision, and, skill, an, approximately, 15, foot, 5, m, long, approach, area, used, by, the, bowler, to, impart, speed, and, apply, rotation, to, the, ball, ends, in, a, foul, line, the, 41, 5, inch, wide, 105, cm, 60, foot, long, 18, m, lane, is, bordered, along, its, length, by, gutters, channels, that, collect, errant, balls, the, lane, s, long, and, narrow, shape, limits, straight, line, ball, paths, to, angles, that, are, smaller, than, optimum, angles, for, achieving, strikes, accordingly, bowlers, impart, side, rotation, to, hook, curve, the, ball, into, the, pins, to, increase, the, likelihood, of, striking, oil, is, applied, to, approximately, the, first, two, thirds, of, the, lane, s, length, to, allow, a, skid, area, for, the, ball, before, it, encounters, friction, and, hooks, the, oil, is, applied, in, different, lengths, and, layout, patterns, especially, in, professional, and, tournament, play, to, add, complexity, and, regulate, challenge, in, the, sport, especially, when, coupled, with, technological, developments, in, ball, design, since, the, early, 1990s, easier, oil, patterns, common, for, league, bowling, enable, many, league, bowlers, to, achieve, scores, rivaling, those, of, professional, bowlers, who, must, bowl, on, more, difficult, patterns, a, development, that, has, caused, substantial, controversy, ten, pin, bowling, arose, in, the, early, 1800s, as, an, alternative, to, nine, pin, bowling, with, truly, standardized, regulations, not, being, agreed, on, until, nearly, the, end, of, that, century, after, the, development, of, automated, mechanical, pinsetters, the, sport, enjoyed, a, golden, age, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, following, substantial, declines, since, the, 1980s, in, both, professional, tournament, television, ratings, and, amateur, league, participation, bowling, centers, have, increasingly, expanded, to, become, diverse, entertainment, centers, ten, pin, bowling, is, often, simply, referred, to, as, bowling, ten, pin, or, less, commonly, big, ball, is, prepended, in, the, english, speaking, world, to, distinguish, it, from, other, bowling, types, such, as, bowls, candlepin, duckpin, and, five, pin, ten, pin, bowling, lanes, are, 60, feet, 18, 29, m, from, the, foul, line, to, the, center, of, the, head, pin, 1, pin, with, guide, arrows, aiming, targets, about, 15, feet, 4, 57, m, from, the, foul, line, the, lane, is, 41, 5, inches, 1, 05, m, wide, and, has, 39, wooden, boards, or, is, made, of, a, synthetic, material, with, the, 39, boards, simulated, using, marking, lines, the, approach, has, two, sets, of, dots, respectively, 12, feet, 3, 66, m, and, 15, feet, 4, 57, m, behind, the, foul, line, to, help, with, foot, placement, modern, bowling, lanes, have, oil, patterns, designed, not, only, to, shield, the, lanes, from, damage, from, bowling, ball, impacts, but, to, provide, bowlers, with, different, levels, of, challenge, in, achieving, strikes, as, illustrated, a, typical, house, pattern, or, ths, typical, house, shot, has, drier, outside, portions, that, give, bowling, balls, more, friction, to, hook, curve, into, the, pocket, but, heavier, oil, concentrations, surrounding, the, centerline, so, that, balls, slide, directly, toward, the, pocket, with, less, hooking, in, the, more, challenging, sport, patterns, used, in, tournaments, and, professional, level, matches, a, flat, oil, pattern, one, with, oil, distributed, more, evenly, from, side, to, side, provides, little, assistance, in, guiding, the, ball, toward, the, pocket, and, is, less, forgiving, with, regard, to, off, target, shots, the, ratio, of, centerline, oil, concentration, to, side, oil, concentration, the, oil, ratio, can, exceed, 10, to, 1, for, thss, but, is, restricted, to, 3, to, 1, or, less, for, sport, shots, lane, oils, also, called, lane, conditioners, are, composed, of, about, 98, mineral, oil, that, with, numerous, additives, are, designed, to, minimize, breakdown, and, carry, down, that, would, change, ball, reaction, after, repeated, ball, rolls, lane, oils, are, characterized, by, different, levels, of, viscosity, with, oils, of, higher, viscosity, thicker, consistency, being, more, durable, but, causing, balls, to, slow, and, hook, earlier, than, lower, viscosity, oils, rubber, balls, introduced, in, 1905, were, eventually, supplanted, by, polyester, plastic, balls, 1959, and, polyurethane, urethane, balls, 1980s, coverstocks, surfaces, of, bowling, balls, then, evolved, to, increase, the, hook, enhancing, friction, between, ball, and, lane, reactive, resin, balls, arrived, in, the, early, 1990s, and, particle, enhanced, resin, balls, in, the, late, 1990s, meanwhile, the, increasingly, sophisticated, technology, of, internal, cores, also, called, weight, blocks, has, increased, balls, dynamic, imbalance, which, in, conjunction, with, the, coverstocks, increased, friction, enhances, hook, curving, potential, to, achieve, the, higher, entry, angles, that, have, enabled, dramatic, increases, in, strike, percentage, and, game, scores, hook, potential, has, increased, so, much, that, dry, lane, conditions, or, spare, shooting, scenarios, sometimes, compel, use, of, plastic, or, urethane, balls, to, purposely, avoid, the, larger, hook, provided, by, reactive, technology, the, united, states, bowling, congress, usbc, regulates, ball, parameters, including, maximum, diameter, 8, 595, inches, 21, 83, cm, maximum, circumference, 27, inches, 0, 69, m, and, maximum, weight, 16, pounds, 7, 26, kg, because, pin, spacing, is, much, larger, than, ball, size, it, is, impossible, for, the, ball, to, contact, all, pins, therefore, a, tactical, shot, is, required, which, would, result, in, a, chain, reaction, of, pins, hitting, other, pins, called, pin, scatter, in, what, is, considered, an, ideal, strike, shot, the, ball, contacts, only, the, 1, 3, 5, and, 9, pins, right, handed, deliveries, most, new, players, roll, the, ball, straight, while, more, experienced, bowlers, may, roll, a, hook, that, involves, making, the, ball, start, out, straight, but, then, curve, toward, a, target, to, increase, the, likelihood, of, striking, usbc, research, has, shown, that, shots, most, likely, to, strike, enter, the, pocket, at, an, angle, of, entry, that, is, achievable, only, with, a, hook, a, complex, interaction, of, a, variety, of, factors, influences, ball, motion, and, its, effect, on, scoring, results, such, factors, may, be, categorized, as, bowling, pins, with, a, maximum, thickness, of, 4, 766, inches, 12, cm, at, the, waist, are, spotted, placed, in, four, rows, forming, an, equilateral, triangle, with, four, pins, on, a, side, to, form, a, tetractys, neighboring, pins, are, centered, 12, inches, 30, cm, apart, leaving, a, space, of, 7, 234, inches, 18, cm, between, pins, that, can, be, bridged, by, a, bowling, ball, of, regulation, diameter, 8, 5, inches, 22, cm, pin, carry, essentially, determines, the, probability, of, achieving, a, strike, assuming, the, ball, impacts, in, or, near, the, pocket, and, varies, with, several, factors, even, before, a, 2008, usbc, pin, carry, study, it, was, known, that, entry, angle, and, ball, weight, increase, strike, percentages, the, 2008, study, concluded, that, an, impact, with, the, ball, centered, at, board, 17, 5, causes, pin, scatter, that, maximizes, likelihood, of, striking, the, material, of, the, pin, deck, and, kickback, side, plates, was, also, found, to, materially, affect, pin, carry, three, widely, recognized, categories, are, stroker, cranker, and, tweener, a, conventional, grip, used, on, non, customized, house, balls, and, some, custom, drilled, balls, involves, insertion, of, fingers, to, the, second, knuckle, a, fingertip, grip, involving, insertion, of, fingers, only, to, the, first, knuckle, enables, greater, revolution, rates, and, resultant, hook, potential, a, thumbless, grip, often, used, by, so, called, two, handed, bowlers, maximizes, ball, rotational, speed, rev, rate, the, usbc, indicated, that, effective, august, 1, 2023, it, is, certifying, string, pinsetters, and, string, pin, bowling, as, an, independent, category, of, equipment, and, competition, separate, from, conventional, free, fall, pinsetters, usbc, lab, data, indicated, strike, percentage, on, string, pin, bowling, is, 7, 1, lower, causing, the, usbc, to, plan, additional, testing, to, determine, whether, a, scoring, conversion, should, be, created, between, the, categories, string, pinsetters, are, less, expensive, and, easier, to, maintain, motivating, bowling, centers, to, phase, them, in, frame, one, 10, 3, 6, 19, frame, one, 7, 3, 4, 14, in, traditional, scoring, one, point, is, scored, for, each, pin, that, is, knocked, over, and, when, fewer, than, all, ten, pins, are, knocked, down, in, two, rolls, in, a, frame, an, open, frame, the, frame, is, scored, with, the, total, number, of, pins, knocked, down, however, when, all, ten, pins, are, knocked, down, with, either, the, first, or, second, rolls, of, a, frame, a, mark, bonus, pins, are, awarded, as, follows, the, maximum, score, is, 300, achieved, by, getting, twelve, strikes, in, a, row, within, the, same, game, known, as, a, perfect, game, the, world, bowling, scoring, system, described, as, current, frame, scoring, awards, pins, as, follows, the, maximum, score, is, 300, achieved, with, ten, consecutive, strikes, as, opposed, to, twelve, in, traditional, scoring, but, with, no, bonus, pins, received, in, the, tenth, frame, world, bowling, scoring, is, thought, to, make, bowling, easier, to, follow, than, with, traditional, scoring, increase, television, viewership, and, help, bowling, to, become, an, olympic, sport, another, variant, of, scoring, a, 12, frame, system, introduced, at, the, november, 2014, world, bowling, tour, wbt, finals, resembles, golf, s, match, play, scoring, in, counting, the, greater, number, of, frames, won, rather, than, measuring, accumulated, pinfall, score, a, frame, may, be, won, immediately, by, a, higher, pincount, on, the, first, roll, of, the, frame, and, a, match, may, be, won, when, one, player, is, ahead, by, more, frames, than, remain, of, the, possible, 12, frames, this, variant, reduces, match, length, and, scoring, complexity, for, two, player, matches, modern, ten, pin, bowling, derives, mainly, from, the, german, kegelspiel, or, kegeling, which, used, nine, pins, set, in, a, diamond, formation, the, enjoyment, of, kegeling, by, german, peasants, contrasted, with, lawn, bowls, that, was, reserved, for, the, upper, classes, consistent, with, bowling, s, enduring, reputation, as, a, common, man, s, sport, a, circa, 1810, painting, of, ipswich, england, shows, a, man, bowling, outdoors, with, a, triangular, formation, of, ten, pins, an, outdoor, version, of, ten, pin, bowling, was, advertised, also, in, ipswich, at, least, as, early, as, 1828, an, 1841, connecticut, law, banned, ninepin, bowling, because, of, its, perceived, association, with, gambling, and, crime, and, people, were, said, to, circumvent, the, prohibition, by, adding, a, tenth, pin, other, locations, e, g, 1838, re, baltimore, and, 1842, charles, dickens, re, new, york, also, recount, that, strategy, even, earlier, an, 1834, washington, d, c, ordinance, had, limited, the, time, before, 8, p, m, and, not, on, sundays, and, place, more, than, 100, yards, from, inhabited, houses, of, nine, pin, and, ten, pins, or, any, game, in, the, likeness, or, imitation, thereof, played, with, any, number, of, pins, whatsoever, u, s, newspapers, referred, to, ten, pin, alleys, at, least, as, early, as, 1820, also, later, in, the, 1820s, and, in, the, 1830s, in, the, mid, 1800s, various, alternatives, to, free, standing, pins, received, u, s, patents, to, solve, perceived, problems, in, pinsetting, and, ball, return, aiming, to, avoid, the, need, for, human, pinsetters, to, perform, these, functions, one, scheme, 1851, involved, pins, with, spherical, bases, that, when, hit, by, a, ball, merely, fell, over, in, place, to, be, rotated, back, to, a, vertical, position, a, second, arrangement, 1853, involved, resetting, the, pins, via, cords, descending, from, respective, pin, bottoms, to, weights, beneath, the, pin, deck, another, design, 1869, involved, suspending, the, pins, with, overhead, cords, in, 1884, the, brunswick, corporation, became, the, first, american, bowling, ball, manufacturer, and, by, 1905, introduced, the, mineralite, hard, rubber, ball, that, was, considered, so, revolutionary, over, wooden, balls, that, it, was, displayed, at, the, century, of, progress, exposition, in, 1934, in, 1886, joe, thum, who, would, become, known, as, the, father, of, bowling, began, opening, bowling, alleys, and, over, decades, strove, to, elevate, the, sport, s, image, to, compete, with, upper, class, diversions, such, as, theaters, and, opera, houses, in, 1875, delegates, from, new, york, city, and, brooklyn, bowling, clubs, formed, the, national, bowling, association, nba, to, standardize, rules, but, disagreements, prevailed, in, 1887, albert, g, spalding, wrote, standard, rules, for, bowling, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, mid, 1890s, the, united, bowling, clubs, ubc, was, organized, with, 120, members, the, american, bowling, congress, abc, was, established, in, 1895, followed, by, the, women, s, international, bowling, congress, wibc, in, the, 1910s, such, organizations, promoting, standardized, rules, and, striving, to, improve, the, sport, s, image, from, 1920, to, 1929, the, number, of, abc, sanctioned, alleys, grew, from, 450, to, about, 2, 000, with, prohibition, leading, to, the, growth, of, family, appropriate, dry, alleys, the, 1933, repeal, of, prohibition, allowed, breweries, to, sponsor, teams, and, bowlers, adding, to, bowling, s, reputation, as, a, working, class, sport, though, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, most, bowling, alleys, were, small, establishments, post, prohibition, bowling, lanes, shifted, from, side, entertainment, at, fancy, victorian, venues, or, seedier, saloons, to, independent, establishments, that, embraced, the, art, deco, style, and, fit, the, era, s, perceived, need, for, speed, gottfried, schmidt, invented, the, first, mechanical, pinsetter, in, his, garage, in, 1936, one, implementation, of, which, was, publicly, exhibited, in, 1946, before, amf, placed, a, production, model, into, service, in, 1952, the, 1940s, through, the, 1970s, became, known, as, the, golden, age, of, bowling, with, abc, membership, growing, from, 700, 000, 1940, to, 1, 1, million, 1947, to, 2,

automatic, mechanical, pinsetters, by, amf, 1952, and, brunswick, 1955, television, broadcasts, said, to, be, ubiquitous, in, the, 1950s, modernization, and, stylization, of, establishments, with, amenities, to, attract, broader, clientele, and, formation, of, bowling, leagues, though, president, truman, had, installed, a, bowling, alley, in, the, white, house, in, 1947, a, report, of, the, american, society, of, planning, officials, in, 1958, characterized, bowling, alleys, as, the, poor, man, s, country, club, abc, bylaws, had, included, a, white, males, only, clause, since, its, inception, in, the, 1890s, but, numerous, lobbying, efforts, and, legal, actions, after, world, war, ii, by, civil, rights, and, labor, organizations, led, to, a, reversal, of, this, policy, in, 1950, sports, agent, eddie, elias, founded, the, professional, bowlers, association, pba, in, 1958, with, 33, members, and, the, first, pba, tournaments, began, in, 1959, the, pro, bowlers, tour, tv, program, aired, from, 1962, through, 1997, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, professional, bowling, was, dominated, by, beer, leagues, with, many, of, the, best, bowlers, sponsored, by, beer, companies, but, by, 1965, the, pba, tour, was, televised, nationally, on, abc, sports, with, sponsors, such, as, coca, cola, and, ford, in, parallel, with, professional, bowling, was, action, bowling, or, pot,

installed, in, sweden, in, 1909, but, attempts, to, popularize, the, sport, in, europe, were, unsuccessful, over, the, next, several, decades, though, hundreds, of, lanes, were, installed, on, u, s, military, bases, in, the, u, k, during, world, war, ii, various, countries, developed, the, sport, to, some, extent, and, the, f, d, ration, internationale, des, quilleurs, fiq, now, world, bowling,

and, the, british, tenpin, bowling, association, btba, was, formed, the, following, year, the, first, british, made, tenpin, was, by, h, massil, and, sons, who, received, the, permit, no, 1, from, the, btba, various, other, countries, including, australia, mexico, and, japan, adopted, the, trend, over, the, ensuing, decade, after, initial, faddish, growth, in, the, u, k, however, the, sport, did, not, thrive, as, it, did, in, the, u, s, and, by, the, 1970s, many, british, bowling, alleys, were, converted, to, serve, competing, pastimes, such, as, bingo, the, lane, master, automatic, lane,

bowling, alley, remodeling, technological, innovations, in, balls, and, lanes, computerized, scoring, and, promotion, by, bowling, organizations, from, 1998, to, 2013, the, number, of, american, bowling, centers, fell, by, one, quarter, similarly, in, the, two, decades, following, 1997, the, number, of, usbc, certified, lanes, also, indicative, of, business, viability, declined, by, one, third, this, business, decline, is, often, attributed, to, waning, league, participation, usbc, membership, indicative, of, league, participation, that, was, the, main, source, of, revenue, declined, by, two, thirds, in, those, two, decades, and, the, portion, of, alley, revenue, attributable, to, leagues, is, estimated, to, have, dropped, from, 70, to, 40, political, scientist, robert, d, putnam, s, book, bowling, alone, 2000, asserts, with, some, controversy, that, the, retreat, from, league, bowling, epitomizes, a, broader, societal, decline, in, social, civic, and, community, engagement,

greater, than, hundredfold, increase, that, many, thought, threatened, to, jeopardize, the, integrity, of, the, sport, though, median, averages, for, male, league, bowlers, remained, at, about, 168, from, the, 1980s, through, the, mid, 2010s, the, number, of, top, average, scores, over, 190, soared, suggesting, that, more, skilled, bowlers, are, making, use, of, technological, advancements, the, usbc, technical, director, wrote, that, the, usbc, is, concerned, that, technology, has, overtaken, player, skill, in, determining, success, in, the, sport, of, bowling, announcing, in, 2007, the, completion, of, a, ball, motion, study, undertaken, to, strike, a, better, balance, between, player, skill, and, technology, separately, a, usbc, pin, carry, study, completed, in, about, 2008, found, that, dramatically, increased, entry, angles, improve, pin, carry, to, result, in, higher, scores, regardless, of, whether, the, bowlers, supplied, additional, effort, or, improved, their, skill, among, the, factors, allowing, higher, scores, were, technological, advances, in, coverstock, and, core, design, combined, with, improved, lane, surfaces, and, accommodative, oil, patterns, specifically, the, reactive, resin, balls, and, particle, balls, that, came, out, in, the, 1990s, increased, frictional, engagement, with, the, lane, to, provide, greater, hook, potential, that, made, high, entry, angles, easier, to, achieve, moreover, changes, in, lane, surface, technology, as, well, as, the, introduction, of, voids, into, pins, to, make, them, lighter, and, more, top, heavy, helped, to, raise, average, scores, as, early, as, the, 1970s, expanded, choices, in, oil, viscosity, and, electronically, controlled, lane, oiling, machines, permitted, alley, owners, to, customize, house, oil, patterns, to, optimize, the, advantages, of, the, new, ball, technologies, technological, progress, allowed, some, 1990s, league, scores, to, surpass, those, of, professionals, in, the, 1950s, responding, to, such, concerns, the, usbc, initiated, sport, bowling, leagues, and, tournaments, that, provide, sport, challenge, and, pba, experience, oil, patterns, that, are, more, challenging, than, the, accommodative, patterns, of, typical, house, shots, still, the, usbc, has, encountered, enduring, issues, concerning, how, to, maintain, average, integrity, fair, handicapping, across, leagues, using, oil, patterns, of, differing, difficulty, as, a, result, of, various, usbc, studies, including, a, bowling, technology, study, published, in, february, 2018, the, usbc, equipment, and, specifications, committee, established, new, specifications, focusing, mainly, on, balls, the, overall, result, of, the, new, specifications, was, said, to, slightly, limit, hook, potential, more, specifically, eliminating, balance, holes, as, of, the, 2020, 21, season, and, setting, a, new, specification, for, oil, absorption, the, usbc, stated, that, the, new, specifications, will, slow, oil, pattern, transition, cause, bowlers, to, move, less, and, keep, the, same, scoring, pace, with, lower, oil, volume, beginning, in, 1962, abc, s, pro, bowlers, tour, was, broadcast, on, saturday, afternoons, to, be, viewed, by, millions, and, with, various, entertainment, oriented, programs, including, make, that, spare, celebrity, bowling, and, bowling, for, dollars, confirmed, the, sport, s, popularity, the, pro, bowlers, tour, garnered, excellent, ratings, in, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, as, a, lead, in, to, abc, s, wide, world, of, sports, however, television, ratings, fell, substantially, from, 9, 1, in, the, mid, 1970s, to, 2, 0, in, 1997, the, year, in, which, pro, bowlers, tour, was, canceled, the, decline, in, bowling, event, coverage, has, been, attributed, to, a, variety, of, factors, including, time, demands, burdening, the, schedules, of, two, income, households, small, purses, winnings, for, professional, tournaments, declining, participation, in, league, bowling, the, perceived, demographic, of, bowlers, old, or, of, low, social, class, waning, popularity, with, the, public, competing, sports, programming, on, cable, television, lack, of, corporate, sponsorship, lack, of, an, inspiring, bowling, star, 2004, and, an, aging, audience, for, tv, bowling, a, 2006, pba, article, describing, the, pba, bowlers, in, the, documentary, a, league, of, ordinary, gentlemen, called, bowling, athletes, the, rodney, dangerfields, of, professional, sports, the, decline, in, coverage, has, also, been, attributed, to, the, perception, that, bowling, is, less, an, athletic, sport, not, being, in, the, olympic, games, and, more, of, a, recreational, pastime, such, as, for, children, s, birthday, parties, this, perception, is, reinforced, by, the, easy, lane, conditions, provided, to, bowling, leagues, that, enable, seasoned, league, bowlers, to, achieve, scores, rivaling, those, of, professionals, who, must, bowl, under, more, challenging, lane, conditions, former, pba, commissioner, mark, gerberich, said, that, abc, paid, the, pba, 200, 000, per, broadcast, in, 1991, but, by, 1997, we, were, paying, 150, 000, to, stay, on, tv, said,
