mexico, maize, is, the, most, commonly, consumed, grain, in, almost, all, areas, of, the, country, and, serves, as, the, main, ingredient, in, many, local, recipes, e, g, maize, tortillas, atole, pozole, menudo, tamal, while, also, eaten, fresh, most, maize, is, dried, nixtamalized, and, ground, into, a, dough, called, masa, this, dough, is, used, both, fresh, and, fermented, to, make, a, wide, variety, of, dishes, from, drinks, atole, pozole, etc, to, tamales, sopes, and, much, more, however, the, most, common, way, to, eat, maize, in, mexico, is, in, the, form, of, a, tortilla, which, accompanies, almost, every, dish, tortillas, are, made, of, maize, in, most, of, the, country, but, other, regional, versions, exist, such, as, wheat, in, the, north, or, plantain, yuca, and, wild, greens, in, oaxaca, the, other, basic, ingredient, in, all, parts, of, mexico, is, the, chile, pepper, mexican, food, has, a, reputation, for, being, very, spicy, but, it, has, a, wide, range, of, flavors, and, while, many, spices, are, used, for, cooking, not, all, are, spicy, many, dishes, also, have, subtle, flavors, chiles, are, indigenous, to, mexico, and, their, use, dates, back, thousands, of, years, they, are, used, for, their, flavors, and, not, just, their, heat, with, mexico, using, the, widest, variety, if, a, savory, dish, or, snack, does, not, contain, chile, pepper, hot, sauce, is, usually, added, and, chile, pepper, is, often, added, to, fresh, fruit, and, sweets, the, importance, of, the, chile, goes, back, to, the, mesoamerican, period, where, it, was, considered, to, be, as, much, of, a, staple, as, corn, and, beans, in, the, 16th, century, bartolom, de, las, casas, wrote, that, without, chiles, the, indigenous, people, did, not, think, they, were, eating, even, today, most, mexicans, believe, that, their, national, identity, would, be, at, a, loss, without, chiles, and, the, many, varieties, of, sauces, and, salsas, created, using, chiles, as, their, base, many, dishes, in, mexico, are, defined, by, their, sauces, and, the, chiles, those, sauces, contain, which, are, usually, very, spicy, rather, than, the, meat, or, vegetable, that, the, sauce, covers, these, dishes, include, entomatada, in, tomato, sauce, adobo, or, adobados, pipians, and, moles, a, hominy, soup, called, pozole, is, defined, as, white, green, or, red, depending, on, the, chile, sauce, used, or, omitted, tamales, are, differentiated, by, the, filling, which, is, again, defined, by, the, sauce, red, or, green, chile, pepper, or, mole, dishes, without, a, sauce, are, rarely, eaten, without, salsa, or, without, fresh, or, pickled, chiles, this, includes, street, foods, such, as, tacos, tortas, soup, sopes, tlacoyos, tlayudas, gorditas, and, sincronizadas, for, most, dishes, it, is, the, type, of, chile, used, that, gives, it, its, main, flavor, chipotle, smoked, dried, jalape, o, pepper, is, very, common, in, mexican, cuisine, in, addition, to, corn, common, beans, phaseolus, vulgaris, are, a, historical, component, of, the, mexican, diet, genetic, evidence, indicates, domestication, occurred, in, mesoamerica, as, well, as, south, america, common, bean, varieties, and, cultivars, used, in, mexican, cuisine, include, the, pinto, bean, and, the, black, turtle, bean, beans, and, corn, are, deficient, in, different, essential, amino, acids, but, complement, each, other, when, eaten, in, combination, they, provide, a, complete, protein, source, together, with, mesoamerica, spain, is, the, second, basis, of, mexican, cuisine, contributing, in, two, fundamental, ways, firstly, they, brought, with, them, old, world, staples, and, ingredients, which, did, not, exist, in, the, americas, such, as, sugar, wheat, rice, onions, garlic, limes, oil, dairy, products, pork, beef, and, many, others, secondly, they, brought, various, culinary, traditions, from, the, iberian, peninsula, which, have, become, prevalent, in, mexico, equally, the, discovery, of, the, incorporation, of, new, world, ingredients, to, spanish, cuisine, has, led, to, many, shared, naming, of, foods, such, as, chorizo, which, uses, paprika, spanish, cuisine, was, in, turn, heavily, influenced, by, its, moorish, heritage, and, this, created, one, of, the, earliest, instances, of, the, world, s, greatest, fusion, cuisines, the, spanish, also, introduced, the, technique, of, frying, in, pork, fat, today, the, main, meats, found, in, mexico, are, pork, chicken, beef, goat, and, sheep, seafood, and, fish, are, also, popular, especially, along, the, coasts, and, the, way, of, cooking, it, commonly, has, spanish, origin, such, as, huachinango, a, la, vizcaina, cheesemaking, in, mexico, has, evolved, its, specialties, although, spanish, style, cheese, such, as, manchego, is, also, produced, in, mexico, it, is, an, important, economic, activity, especially, in, the, north, and, is, frequently, done, at, home, the, main, cheese, making, areas, are, chihuahua, oaxaca, quer, taro, and, chiapas, goat, cheese, is, still, made, but, it, is, not, as, popular, and, is, harder, to, find, in, stores, churros, are, a, common, snack, originating, in, spain, and, because, sugar, cane, was, brought, to, the, americas, through, spanish, colonization, all, of, mexico, s, sweets, have, a, hispanic, origin, often, with, a, muslim, heritage, such, as, alfe, iques, in, most, of, mexico, especially, in, rural, areas, much, of, the, food, is, consumed, in, the, home, cooking, for, the, family, is, usually, considered, to, be, women, s, work, and, this, includes, cooking, for, celebrations, as, well, traditionally, girls, have, been, considered, ready, to, marry, when, they, can, cook, and, cooking, is, considered, a, main, talent, for, housewives, the, main, meal, of, the, day, in, mexico, is, the, comida, meaning, meal, in, spanish, meals, eaten, are, as, follows, the, early, morning, meal, or, breakfast, is, called, desayuno, which, entails, coffee, atole, maize, drink, and, a, light, meal, in, some, areas, the, almuerzo, around, 11am, which, includes, a, snack, and, drink, then, followed, by, comida, or, lunch, taken, between, noon, and, 2pm, which, in, itself, is, usually, the, heaviest, meal, of, the, day, it, sometimes, begins, with, soup, often, chicken, broth, with, pasta, or, a, dry, soup, which, is, pasta, or, rice, flavored, with, onions, garlic, or, vegetables, the, main, course, is, meat, served, in, a, cooked, sauce, with, salsa, on, the, side, accompanied, with, beans, and, tortillas, and, often, with, a, fruit, drink, in, some, areas, the, last, meal, of, the, day, is, cena, or, suppper, which, varies, greatly, by, region, and, is, usually, eaten, between, 6pm, and, 9pm, in, the, evening, it, is, common, to, eat, leftovers, from, the, comida, or, sweet, bread, accompanied, by, coffee, or, chocolate, breakfast, can, consist, of, meat, in, broth, such, as, pancita, tacos, enchiladas, or, meat, with, eggs, this, is, usually, served, with, beans, tortillas, and, coffee, or, juice, mexican, cuisine, is, elaborate, and, often, tied, to, symbolism, and, festivals, which, is, one, reason, it, was, named, as, an, example, of, the, intangible, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, by, unesco, many, of, the, foods, of, mexico, are, complicated, because, of, their, relation, to, the, social, structure, of, the, country, food, preparation, especially, for, family, and, social, events, is, considered, to, be, an, investment, in, order, to, maintain, social, relationships, even, the, idea, of, flavor, is, considered, to, be, social, with, meals, prepared, for, certain, dinners, and, certain, occasions, when, they, are, considered, the, most, tasty, the, ability, to, cook, well, called, saz, n, lit, seasoning, is, considered, to, be, a, gift, generally, gained, from, experience, and, a, sense, of, commitment, to, the, diners, for, the, day, of, the, dead, festival, foods, such, as, tamales, and, mole, are, set, out, on, altars, and, it, is, believed, that, the, visiting, dead, relatives, eat, the, essence, of, the, food, if, eaten, afterwards, by, the, living, it, is, considered, to, be, tasteless, in, central, mexico, the, main, festival, foods, are, mole, barbacoa, carnitas, and, mixiotes, they, are, often, prepared, to, feed, hundreds, of, guests, requiring, groups, of, cooks, the, cooking, is, part, of, the, social, custom, meant, to, bind, families, and, communities, mexican, regional, home, cooking, is, completely, different, from, the, food, served, in, most, mexican, restaurants, outside, mexico, which, is, usually, some, variety, of, tex, mex, the, original, versions, of, mexican, dishes, are, vastly, different, from, their, tex, mex, variation, some, of, mexico, s, traditional, foods, involved, complex, or, long, cooking, processes, including, cooking, underground, such, as, cochinita, pibil, before, industrialization, traditional, women, spent, several, hours, a, day, boiling, dried, corn, then, grinding, it, on, a, metate, to, make, the, dough, for, tortillas, cooking, them, one, by, one, on, a, comal, griddle, in, some, areas, tortillas, are, still, made, this, way, sauces, and, salsas, were, also, ground, in, a, mortar, called, a, molcajete, today, blenders, are, more, often, used, though, the, texture, is, a, bit, different, most, people, in, mexico, would, say, that, those, made, with, a, molcajete, taste, better, but, few, do, this, now, the, most, important, food, for, festivals, and, other, special, occasions, is, mole, especially, mole, poblano, in, the, center, of, the, country, mole, is, served, at, christmas, easter, day, of, the, dead, and, at, birthdays, baptisms, weddings, and, funerals, and, tends, to, be, eaten, only, for, special, occasions, because, it, is, such, a, complex, and, time, consuming, dish, while, still, dominant, in, this, way, other, foods, have, become, acceptable, for, these, occasions, such, as, barbacoa, carnitas, and, mixiotes, especially, since, the, 1980s, this, may, have, been, because, of, economic, crises, at, that, time, allowing, for, the, substitution, of, these, cheaper, foods, or, the, fact, that, they, can, be, bought, ready, made, or, may, already, be, made, as, part, of, the, family, business, another, important, festive, food, is, the, tamale, also, known, as, tamal, in, spanish, this, is, a, filled, cornmeal, dumpling, steamed, in, a, wrapping, usually, a, corn, husk, or, banana, leaf, and, one, of, the, basic, staples, in, most, regions, of, mexico, it, has, its, origins, in, the, pre, hispanic, era, and, today, is, found, in, many, varieties, in, all, of, mexico, like, a, mole, it, is, complicated, to, prepare, and, best, done, in, large, amounts, tamales, are, associated, with, certain, celebrations, such, as, candlemas, they, are, wrapped, in, corn, husks, in, the, highlands, and, desert, areas, of, mexico, and, in, banana, leaves, in, the, tropics, mexican, street, food, can, include, tacos, quesadillas, pambazos, tamales, huaraches, alambres, al, pastor, and, food, not, suitable, to, cook, at, home, including, barbacoa, carnitas, and, since, many, homes, in, mexico, do, not, make, use, of, ovens, roasted, chicken, one, attraction, of, street, food, in, mexico, is, the, satisfaction, of, hunger, or, craving, without, all, the, social, and, emotional, connotation, of, eating, at, home, although, longtime, customers, can, have, something, of, a, friendship, familial, relationship, with, a, chosen, vendor, tacos, are, the, top, rated, and, most, well, known, street, mexican, food, it, is, made, up, of, meat, or, other, fillings, wrapped, in, a, tortilla, often, served, with, cheese, added, vegetarian, fillings, include, mushrooms, potatoes, rice, or, beans, the, origin, of, tacos, is, based, on, the, pre, hispanic, custom, of, picking, up, other, foods, with, tortillas, as, utensils, were, not, used, the, origin, of, the, word, is, in, dispute, with, some, saying, it, is, derived, from, nahuatl, and, others, from, various, spanish, phrases, it, possible, that, the, term, taco, comes, from, the, term, tlaco, or, tlacatl, which, means, middle, or, half, in, nahuatl, tacos, are, not, eaten, as, the, main, meal, they, are, generally, eaten, before, midday, or, late, in, the, evening, just, about, any, other, foodstuff, can, be, wrapped, in, a, tortilla, and, in, mexico, it, varies, from, rice, to, meat, plain, or, in, sauce, to, cream, to, vegetables, to, cheese, or, simply, to, plain, chile, peppers, or, fresh, salsa, preferred, fillings, vary, from, region, to, region, with, pork, generally, found, more, often, in, the, center, and, south, beef, in, the, north, seafood, along, the, coasts, and, chicken, and, lamb, in, most, of, the, country, another, popular, street, food, especially, in, mexico, city, and, the, surrounding, area, is, the, torta, it, consists, of, a, roll, of, some, type, stuffed, with, several, ingredients, this, has, its, origins, in, the, 19th, century, when, the, french, introduced, a, number, of, new, kinds, of, bread, the, torta, began, by, splitting, the, roll, and, adding, beans, today, refried, beans, can, still, be, found, on, many, kinds, of, tortas, in, mexico, city, the, most, common, roll, used, for, tortas, is, called, telera, a, relatively, flat, roll, with, two, splits, on, the, upper, surface, in, puebla, the, preferred, bread, is, called, a, cemita, as, is, the, sandwich, in, both, areas, the, bread, is, stuffed, with, various, fillings, especially, if, it, is, a, hot, sandwich, with, beans, cream, mayonnaise, is, rare, and, some, kind, of, hot, chile, pepper, the, influence, of, american, fast, food, on, mexican, street, food, grew, during, the, late, 20th, century, one, example, of, this, is, the, invention, of, the, sonoran, hot, dog, in, the, late, 1980s, the, frankfurters, are, usually, boiled, then, wrapped, in, bacon, and, fried, they, are, served, in, a, bolillo, style, bun, typically, topped, by, a, combination, of, pinto, beans, diced, tomatoes, onions, and, jalape, o, peppers, and, other, condiments, along, the, us, mexican, border, specifically, dense, areas, like, tijuana, mexican, vendors, sell, food, such, as, fruit, melanged, with, tajin, spice, to, people, crossing, the, border, via, carts, in, recent, years, these, food, carts, have, been, threatened, by, tightened, border, security, at, the, port, of, entry, both, the, us, and, the, mexican, governments, have, proposed, a, project, that, would, widen, the, streets, at, the, border, allowing, for, more, people, to, pass, through, the, border, although, widening, them, would, decimate, neighboring, mercados, that, rely, on, the, business, of, travelers, besides, food, street, vendors, also, sell, various, kinds, of, drinks, including, aguas, frescas, tejuino, and, tepache, and, treats, such, as, bionicos, tostilocos, and, raspados, most, tamale, stands, sell, atole, as, a, standard, accompaniment, around, 7000, bce, the, indigenous, peoples, of, mexico, and, central, america, hunted, game, and, gathered, plants, including, wild, chili, peppers, corn, was, not, yet, cultivated, so, one, main, source, of, calories, was, roasted, agave, hearts, by, 1200, bce, corn, was, domesticated, and, a, process, called, nixtamalization, or, treatment, with, lye, was, developed, to, soften, corn, for, grinding, and, improve, its, nutritional, value, this, allowed, the, creation, of, tortillas, and, other, kinds, of, flat, breads, the, indigenous, peoples, of, mesoamerica, have, numerous, stories, about, the, origin, of, corn, usually, related, to, being, a, gift, of, one, or, more, gods, such, as, quetzalcoatl, the, other, staple, was, beans, eaten, with, corn, and, some, other, plants, as, a, complementary, protein, other, protein, sources, included, amaranth, domesticated, turkey, insects, such, as, grasshoppers, beetles, and, ant, larvae, iguanas, and, turtle, eggs, on, the, coastlines, vegetables, included, squash, and, their, seeds, chilacayote, jicama, a, kind, of, sweet, potato, and, edible, flowers, especially, those, of, squash, the, chile, pepper, was, used, as, food, ritual, and, as, medicine, when, the, spanish, arrived, the, aztecs, had, sophisticated, agricultural, techniques, and, an, abundance, of, food, which, was, the, base, of, their, economy, it, allowed, them, to, expand, an, empire, bringing, in, tribute, which, consisted, mostly, of, foods, the, aztecs, could, not, grow, themselves, according, to, bernardino, de, sahag, n, the, nahua, peoples, of, central, mexico, ate, corn, beans, turkey, fish, small, game, insects, and, a, wide, variety, of, fruits, vegetables, pulses, seeds, tubers, wild, mushrooms, plants, and, herbs, that, they, collected, or, cultivated, after, the, conquest, the, spanish, introduced, a, variety, of, foodstuffs, and, cooking, techniques, like, frying, to, the, new, world, regional, cuisines, remained, varied, with, native, staples, more, prevalent, in, the, rural, southern, areas, and, spanish, foods, taking, root, in, the, more, sparsely, populated, northern, region, european, style, wheat, bread, was, initially, met, unfavorably, with, moctezuma, s, emissaries, who, reportedly, described, it, as, tasting, of, dried, maize, stalks, on, the, spanish, side, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, complained, about, the, maize, cake, rations, on, campaign, the, cuisine, of, spain, is, a, mediterranean, cuisine, influenced, by, its, muslim, andalusian, period, composed, of, a, number, of, staples, such, as, olive, oil, and, rice, spanish, settlers, introduced, these, staples, to, the, region, although, some, continued, to, be, imported, such, as, wine, brandy, nuts, olives, spices, and, capers, they, introduced, domesticated, animals, such, as, pigs, cows, chickens, goats, and, sheep, for, meat, and, milk, raising, the, consumption, of, protein, cheese, became, the, most, important, dairy, product, the, spanish, brought, rice, to, mexico, along, with, sugar, cane, used, extensively, creation, of, many, kinds, of, sweets, especially, local, fruits, in, syrup, a, sugar, based, candy, craft, called, alfe, ique, was, imported, and, is, now, used, for, the, day, of, the, dead, over, time, ingredients, like, olive, oil, rice, onions, garlic, oregano, coriander, cinnamon, and, cloves, became, incorporated, with, native, ingredients, and, cooking, techniques, one, of, the, main, avenues, for, the, mixing, of, the, two, cuisines, was, in, convents, despite, the, influence, of, spanish, culture, mexican, cuisine, has, maintained, its, base, of, corn, beans, and, chili, peppers, natives, continued, to, be, reliant, on, maize, it, was, less, expensive, than, the, wheat, favored, by, european, settlers, it, was, easier, to, cultivate, and, produced, higher, yields, european, control, over, the, land, grew, stronger, with, the, founding, of, wheat, farms, in, 18th, century, mexico, city, wheat, was, baked, into, leaved, rolls, called, pan, franc, s, or, pan, espa, ol, but, only, two, bakers, were, allowed, to, bake, this, style, of, bread, and, they, worked, on, consignment, to, the, viceroy, and, the, archbishop, large, ring, loaves, of, choice, flour, known, as, pan, floreado, were, available, for, wealthy, creoles, other, styles, of, bread, used, lower, quality, wheat, and, maize, to, produce, pan, com, n, pambazo, and, cemita, pozole, is, mentioned, in, the, 16th, century, florentine, codex, by, bernardino, de, sahag, n, in, the, eighteenth, century, an, italian, capuchin, friar, ilarione, da, bergamo, included, descriptions, of, food, in, his, travelogue, he, noted, that, tortillas, were, eaten, not, only, by, the, poor, but, by, the, upper, class, as, well, he, described, lunch, fare, as, pork, products, like, chorizo, and, ham, being, eaten, between, tortillas, with, a, piquant, red, chili, sauce, for, drink, pulque, as, well, as, corn, based, atole, and, for, those, who, could, afford, it, chocolate, based, drinks, were, consumed, twice, a, day, according, to, de, bergamo, s, account, neither, coffee, nor, wine, are, consumed, and, evening, meals, ended, with, a, small, portion, of, beans, in, a, thick, soup, instead, served, to, set, the, stage, for, drinking, water, during, the, 19th, century, mexico, experienced, an, influx, of, various, immigrants, including, french, lebanese, german, chinese, and, italian, which, have, had, some, effect, on, the, food, during, the, french, intervention, in, mexico, french, food, became, popular, with, the, upper, classes, an, influence, on, these, new, trends, came, from, chef, tudor, who, was, brought, to, mexico, by, the, emperor, maximilian, of, habsburg, one, lasting, evidence, of, this, is, the, variety, of, breads, and, sweet, breads, such, as, bolillos, conchas, and, much, more, which, can, be, found, in, mexican, bakeries, the, germans, brought, beer, brewing, techniques, and, the, chinese, added, their, cuisine, to, certain, areas, of, the, country, this, led, to, mexico, characterizing, its, cuisine, more, by, its, relation, to, popular, traditions, rather, than, on, particular, cooking, techniques, since, the, 20th, century, there, has, been, an, interchange, of, food, influences, between, mexico, and, the, united, states, mexican, cooking, was, of, course, still, practiced, in, what, is, now, the, southwest, united, states, after, the, mexican, american, war, but, diana, kennedy, in, her, book, the, cuisines, of, mexico, published, in, 1972, drew, a, sharp, distinction, between, mexican, food, and, tex, mex, tex, mex,

north, of, the, border, only, in, the, latter, 20th, century, from, north, to, south, much, of, the, influence, has, been, related, to, food, industrialization, as, well, as, the, greater, availability, overall, of, food, especially, after, the, mexican, revolution, one, other, very, visible, sign, of, influence, from, the, united, states, is, the, appearance, of, fast, foods, such, as,

an, emphasis, on, traditional, methods, and, ingredients, in, the, cities, there, is, interest, in, publishing, and, preserving, what, is, authentic, mexican, food, this, movement, is, traceable, to, 1982, with, the, mexican, culinary, circle, of, mexico, city, it, was, created, by, a, group, of, women, chefs, and, other, culinary, experts, as, a, reaction, to, the, fear, of, traditions, being,

classic, margarita, a, popular, cocktail, is, composed, of, tequila, cointreau, and, lime, juice, rompope, is, believed, to, have, been, originally, made, in, the, convents, of, the, city, of, puebla,

is, sangria, se, orial, a, sangria, flavored, non, alcoholic, beverage, sangria, is, a, spanish, drink, that, was, introduced, by, spaniards, as, was, horchata, and, agua, de, jamaica, similar, to, other, regions, in, mexico, corn, is, a, dietary, staple, and, other, indigenous, foods, remain, strong, in, the, cuisine, as, well, along, with, a, chile, called, simojovel, used, nowhere, else, in, the, country, the, cuisine, is, also, distinguished, by, the, use, of, herbs, such, as, chipil, n, and, hierba, santa, like, in, oaxaca, tamales, are, usually, wrapped, in, banana, leaves, or, sometimes, with, the, leaves, of, hoja, santa, but, often, chipil, n, is, incorporated, into, the, dough, as, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, boiled, corn, is, drunk, as, a, beverage, called, pozol, but, here, it, is, usually, flavored, with, all, natural, cacao, another, beverage, which, can, be, served, hot, or, cold, typical, from, this, region, is, tascalate, which, is, made, of, powdered,

ocosingo, ray, n, and, pijijiapan, meat, and, cheese, dishes, are, frequently, accompanied, by, vegetables, such, as, squash, chayote, and, carrots, the, main, feature, of, mexico, city, cooking, is, that, it, has, been, influenced, by, those, of, the, other, regions, of, mexico, as, well, as, a, number, of, foreign, influences, this, is, because, mexico, city, has, been, a, center, for, migration, of, people, from, all, over, mexico, since, pre, hispanic, times, most, of, the, ingredients, of, this, area, s, cooking, are, not, grown, in, situ, but, imported, from, all, of, the, country, such, as, tropical, fruits, street, cuisine, is, very, popular, with, taco, stands, and, lunch, counters, on, every, street, popular, foods, in, the, city, include, barbacoa, a, specialty, of, the, central, highlands, birria, from, western, mexico, cabrito, from, the, north, carnitas, originally, from, michoac, n, mole, sauces, from, puebla, and, central, mexico, tacos, with, many, different, fillings, and, large, sub, like, sandwiches, called, tortas, usually, served, at, specialized, shops, called, torter, as, this, is, also, the, area, where, most, of, mexico, s, haute, cuisine, can, be, found, there, are, eateries, that, specialize, in, pre, hispanic, food, including, dishes, with, insects, the, foods, eaten, in, what, is, now, the, north, of, mexico, have, differed, from, those, in, the, south, since, the, pre, hispanic, era, here, the, indigenous, people, were, hunter, gatherers, with, limited, agriculture, and, settlements, because, of, the, arid, land, when, the, europeans, arrived, they, found, much, of, the, land, in, this, area, suitable, for, raising, cattle, goats, and, sheep, this, led, to, the, dominance, of, meat, especially, beef, in, the, region, and, some, of, the, most, popular, dishes, include, machaca, arrachera, and, cabrito, the, region, s, distinctive, cooking, technique, is, grilling, as, ranch, culture, has, promoted, outdoor, cooking, done, by, men, the, ranch, culture, has, also, prompted, cheese, production, and, the, north, produces, the, widest, varieties, of, cheese, in, mexico, these, include, queso, fresco, fresh, farmer, s, cheese, ranchero, similar, to, monterey, jack, cuajada, a, mildly, sweet, creamy, curd, of, fresh, milk, reques, n, similar, to, cottage, cheese, or, ricotta, chihuahua, s, creamy, semi, soft, queso, menonita, and, fifty, six, varieties, of, asadero, smoked, cheese, another, important, aspect, of, northern, cuisine, is, the, presence, of, wheat, especially, in, the, use, of, flour, tortillas, the, area, has, at, least, forty, different, types, of, flour, tortillas, the, main, reason, for, this, is, that, much, of, the, land, supports, wheat, production, introduced, by, the, spanish, these, large, tortillas, allowed, for, the, creation, of, burritos, in, the, border, city, of, ciudad, ju, rez, which, eventually, gained, popularity, in, the, southwest, united, states, the, variety, of, foodstuffs, in, the, north, is, not, as, varied, as, in, the, south, of, mexico, because, of, the, mostly, desert, climate, much, of, the, cuisine, of, this, area, is, dependent, on, food, preservation, techniques, namely, dehydration, and, canning, dried, foods, include, meat, chiles, squash, peas, corn, lentils, beans, and, dried, fruit, a, number, of, these, are, also, canned, preservation, techniques, change, the, flavor, of, foods, for, example, many, chiles, are, less, hot, after, drying, in, northeastern, mexico, during, the, spanish, colonial, period, nuevo, le, n,
