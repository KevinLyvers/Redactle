heterosexuality, is, romantic, attraction, sexual, attraction, or, sexual, behavior, between, people, of, the, opposite, sex, or, gender, as, a, sexual, orientation, heterosexuality, is, an, enduring, pattern, of, emotional, romantic, and, or, sexual, attractions, to, people, of, the, opposite, sex, it, also, refers, to, a, person, s, sense, of, identity, based, on, those, attractions, related, behaviors, and, membership, in, a, community, of, others, who, share, those, attractions, someone, who, is, heterosexual, is, commonly, referred, to, as, straight, along, with, bisexuality, and, homosexuality, heterosexuality, is, one, of, the, three, main, categories, of, sexual, orientation, within, the, heterosexual, homosexual, continuum, across, cultures, most, people, are, heterosexual, and, heterosexual, activity, is, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, sexual, activity, scientists, do, not, know, the, exact, cause, of, sexual, orientation, but, they, theorize, that, it, is, caused, by, a, complex, interplay, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, influences, and, do, not, view, it, as, a, choice, although, no, single, theory, on, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, has, yet, gained, widespread, support, scientists, favor, biologically, based, theories, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, the, term, heterosexual, or, heterosexuality, is, usually, applied, to, humans, but, heterosexual, behavior, is, observed, in, all, other, mammals, and, in, other, animals, as, it, is, necessary, for, sexual, reproduction, hetero, comes, from, the, greek, word, meaning, other, party, or, another, used, in, science, as, a, prefix, meaning, different, and, the, latin, word, for, sex, that, is, characteristic, sex, or, sexual, differentiation, the, current, use, of, the, term, heterosexual, has, its, roots, in, the, broader, 19th, century, tradition, of, personality, taxonomy, the, term, heterosexual, was, coined, alongside, the, word, homosexual, by, karl, maria, kertbeny, in, 1869, the, terms, were, not, in, current, use, during, the, late, nineteenth, century, but, were, reintroduced, by, richard, von, krafft, ebing, and, albert, moll, around, 1890, the, noun, came, into, wider, use, from, the, early, 1920s, but, did, not, enter, common, use, until, the, 1960s, the, colloquial, shortening, hetero, is, attested, from, 1933, the, abstract, noun, heterosexuality, is, first, recorded, in, 1900, the, word, heterosexual, was, listed, in, merriam, webster, s, new, international, dictionary, in, 1923, as, a, medical, term, for, morbid, sexual, passion, for, one, of, the, opposite, sex, however, in, 1934, in, their, second, edition, unabridged, it, is, defined, as, a, manifestation, of, sexual, passion, for, one, of, the, opposite, sex, normal, sexuality, hyponyms, of, heterosexual, include, heteroflexible, the, word, can, be, informally, shortened, to, hetero, the, term, straight, originated, as, a, mid, 20th, century, gay, slang, term, for, heterosexuals, ultimately, coming, from, the, phrase, to, go, straight, as, in, straight, and, narrow, or, stop, engaging, in, homosexual, sex, one, of, the, first, uses, of, the, word, in, this, way, was, in, 1941, by, author, g, w, henry, henry, s, book, concerned, conversations, with, homosexual, males, and, used, this, term, in, connection, with, people, who, are, identified, as, ex, gays, it, is, now, simply, a, colloquial, term, for, heterosexual, having, changed, in, primary, meaning, over, time, some, object, to, usage, of, the, term, straight, because, it, implies, that, non, heterosexual, people, are, crooked, in, their, 2016, literature, review, bailey, et, al, stated, that, they, expect, that, in, all, cultures, the, vast, majority, of, individuals, are, sexually, predisposed, exclusively, to, the, other, sex, i, e, heterosexual, and, that, there, is, no, persuasive, evidence, that, the, demographics, of, sexual, orientation, have, varied, much, across, time, or, place, heterosexual, activity, between, only, one, male, and, one, female, is, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, sociosexual, activity, according, to, several, major, studies, 89, to, 98, of, people, have, had, only, heterosexual, contact, within, their, lifetime, but, this, percentage, falls, to, 79, 84, when, either, or, both, same, sex, attraction, and, behavior, are, reported, a, 1992, study, reported, that, 93, 9, of, males, in, britain, have, only, had, heterosexual, experience, while, in, france, the, number, was, reported, at, 95, 9, according, to, a, 2008, poll, 85, of, britons, have, only, opposite, sex, sexual, contact, while, 94, of, britons, identify, themselves, as, heterosexual, similarly, a, survey, by, the, uk, office, for, national, statistics, ons, in, 2010, found, that, 95, of, britons, identified, as, heterosexual, 1, 5, of, britons, identified, themselves, as, homosexual, or, bisexual, and, the, last, 3, 5, gave, more, vague, answers, such, as, don, t, know, other, or, did, not, respond, to, the, question, in, the, united, states, according, to, a, williams, institute, report, in, april, 2011, 96, or, approximately, 250, million, of, the, adult, population, are, heterosexual, an, october, 2012, gallup, poll, provided, unprecedented, demographic, information, about, those, who, identify, as, heterosexual, arriving, at, the, conclusion, that, 96, 6, with, a, margin, of, error, of, 1, of, all, u, s, adults, identify, as, heterosexual, the, gallup, results, show, in, a, 2015, yougov, survey, of, 1, 000, adults, of, the, united, states, 89, of, the, sample, identified, as, heterosexual, 4, as, homosexual, 2, as, homosexual, male, and, 2, as, homosexual, female, and, 4, as, bisexual, of, either, sex, bailey, et, al, in, their, 2016, review, stated, that, in, recent, western, surveys, about, 93, of, men, and, 87, of, women, identify, as, completely, heterosexual, and, about, 4, of, men, and, 10, of, women, as, mostly, heterosexual, no, simple, and, singular, determinant, for, sexual, orientation, has, been, conclusively, demonstrated, but, scientists, believe, that, a, combination, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, factors, determine, sexual, orientation, they, favor, biological, theories, for, explaining, the, causes, of, sexual, orientation, as, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, factors, related, to, the, development, of, a, heterosexual, orientation, include, genes, prenatal, hormones, and, brain, structure, and, their, interaction, with, the, environment, the, neurobiology, of, the, masculinization, of, the, brain, is, fairly, well, understood, estradiol, and, testosterone, which, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, 5, reductase, into, dihydrotestosterone, act, upon, androgen, receptors, in, the, brain, to, masculinize, it, if, there, are, few, androgen, receptors, people, with, androgen, insensitivity, syndrome, or, too, much, androgen, females, with, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, there, can, be, physical, and, psychological, effects, it, has, been, suggested, that, both, male, and, female, heterosexuality, are, the, results, of, this, process, in, these, studies, heterosexuality, in, females, is, linked, to, a, lower, amount, of, masculinization, than, is, found, in, lesbian, females, though, when, dealing, with, male, heterosexuality, there, are, results, supporting, both, higher, and, lower, degrees, of, masculinization, than, homosexual, males, sexual, reproduction, in, the, animal, world, is, facilitated, through, opposite, sex, sexual, activity, although, there, are, also, animals, that, reproduce, asexually, including, protozoa, and, lower, invertebrates, reproductive, sex, does, not, require, a, heterosexual, orientation, since, sexual, orientation, typically, refers, to, a, long, term, enduring, pattern, of, sexual, and, emotional, attraction, leading, often, to, long, term, social, bonding, while, reproduction, requires, as, little, as, a, single, act, of, copulation, to, fertilize, the, ovum, by, sperm, often, sexual, orientation, and, sexual, orientation, identity, are, not, distinguished, which, can, impact, accurately, assessing, sexual, identity, and, whether, or, not, sexual, orientation, is, able, to, change, sexual, orientation, identity, can, change, throughout, an, individual, s, life, and, may, or, may, not, align, with, biological, sex, sexual, behavior, or, actual, sexual, orientation, sexual, orientation, is, stable, and, unlikely, to, change, for, the, vast, majority, of, people, but, some, research, indicates, that, some, people, may, experience, change, in, their, sexual, orientation, and, this, is, more, likely, for, women, than, for, men, the, american, psychological, association, distinguishes, between, sexual, orientation, an, innate, attraction, and, sexual, orientation, identity, which, may, change, at, any, point, in, a, person, s, life, a, 2012, study, found, that, 2, of, a, sample, of, 2, 560, adult, participants, reported, a, change, of, sexual, orientation, identity, after, a, 10, year, period, for, men, a, change, occurred, in, 0, 78, of, those, who, had, identified, as, heterosexual, 9, 52, of, homosexuals, and, 47, of, bisexuals, for, women, a, change, occurred, in, 1, 36, of, heterosexuals, 63, 6, of, lesbians, and, 64, 7, of, bisexuals, a, 2, year, study, by, lisa, m, diamond, on, a, sample, of, 80, non, heterosexual, female, adolescents, age, 16, 23, reported, that, half, of, the, participants, had, changed, sexual, minority, identities, more, than, once, one, third, of, them, during, the, 2, year, follow, up, diamond, concluded, that, although, sexual, attractions, appear, fairly, stable, sexual, identities, and, behaviors, are, more, fluid, heteroflexibility, is, a, form, of, sexual, orientation, or, situational, sexual, behavior, characterized, by, minimal, homosexual, activity, in, an, otherwise, primarily, heterosexual, orientation, that, is, considered, to, distinguish, it, from, bisexuality, it, has, been, characterized, as, mostly, straight, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, are, methods, that, aim, to, change, sexual, orientation, used, to, try, to, convert, homosexual, and, bisexual, people, to, heterosexuality, scientists, and, mental, health, professionals, generally, do, not, believe, that, sexual, orientation, is, a, choice, there, are, no, studies, of, adequate, scientific, rigor, that, conclude, that, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, are, effective, a, heterosexual, couple, a, man, and, woman, in, an, intimate, relationship, form, the, core, of, a, nuclear, family, many, societies, throughout, history, have, insisted, that, a, marriage, take, place, before, the, couple, settle, down, but, enforcement, of, this, rule, or, compliance, with, it, has, varied, considerably, heterosexual, symbolism, dates, back, to, the, earliest, artifacts, of, humanity, with, gender, symbols, ritual, fertility, carvings, and, primitive, art, this, was, later, expressed, in, the, symbolism, of, fertility, rites, and, polytheistic, worship, which, often, included, images, of, human, reproductive, organs, such, as, lingam, in, hinduism, modern, symbols, of, heterosexuality, in, societies, derived, from, european, traditions, still, reference, symbols, used, in, these, ancient, beliefs, one, such, image, is, a, combination, of, the, symbol, for, mars, the, roman, god, of, war, as, the, definitive, male, symbol, of, masculinity, and, venus, the, roman, goddess, of, love, and, beauty, as, the, definitive, female, symbol, of, femininity, the, unicode, character, for, this, combined, symbol, is, u, 26a4, there, was, no, need, to, coin, a, term, such, as, heterosexual, until, terms, emerged, with, which, it, could, be, compared, and, contrasted, jonathan, ned, katz, dates, the, definition, of, heterosexuality, as, it, is, used, today, to, the, late, 19th, century, according, to, katz, in, the, victorian, era, sex, was, seen, as, a, means, to, achieve, reproduction, and, relations, between, the, sexes, were, not, believed, to, be, overtly, sexual, the, body, was, thought, of, as, a, tool, for, procreation, human, energy, thought, of, as, a, closed, and, severely, limited, system, was, to, be, used, in, producing, children, and, in, work, not, wasted, in, libidinous, pleasures, katz, argues, that, modern, ideas, of, sexuality, and, eroticism, began, to, develop, in, america, and, germany, in, the, later, 19th, century, the, changing, economy, and, the, transformation, of, the, family, from, producer, to, consumer, resulted, in, shifting, values, the, victorian, work, ethic, had, changed, pleasure, became, more, highly, valued, and, this, allowed, ideas, of, human, sexuality, to, change, consumer, culture, had, created, a, market, for, the, erotic, pleasure, became, commoditized, at, the, same, time, medical, doctors, began, to, acquire, more, power, and, influence, they, developed, the, medical, model, of, normal, love, in, which, healthy, men, and, women, enjoyed, sex, as, part, of, a, new, ideal, of, male, female, relationships, that, included, an, essential, necessary, normal, eroticism, this, model, also, had, a, counterpart, the, victorian, sex, pervert, anyone, who, failed, to, meet, the, norm, the, basic, oppositeness, of, the, sexes, was, the, basis, for, normal, healthy, sexual, attraction, the, attention, paid, the, sexual, abnormal, created, a, need, to, name, the, sexual, normal, the, better, to, distinguish, the, average, him, and, her, from, the, deviant, it, the, creation, of, the, term, heterosexual, consolidated, the, social, existence, of, the, pre, existing, heterosexual, experience, and, created, a, sense, of, ensured, and, validated, normalcy, within, it, the, judeo, christian, tradition, has, several, scriptures, related, to, heterosexuality, the, book, of, genesis, states, that, god, created, women, because, it, is, not, good, that, the, man, should, be, alone, i, will, make, him, an, help, meet, for, him, and, that, therefore, shall, a, man, leave, his, father, and, his, mother, and, shall, cleave, unto, his, wife, and, they, shall, be, one, flesh, for, the, most, part, religious, traditions, in, the, world, reserve, marriage, to, heterosexual, unions, but, there, are, exceptions, including, certain, buddhist, and, hindu, traditions, unitarian, universalists, metropolitan, community, church, some, anglican, dioceses, and, some, quaker, united, church, of, canada, and, reform, and, conservative, jewish, congregations, almost, all, religions, believe, that, sex, between, a, man, and, a, woman, within, marriage, is, allowed, but, there, are, a, few, that, believe, that, it, is, a, sin, such, as, the, shakers, the, harmony, society, and, the, ephrata, cloister, these, religions, tend, to, view, all, sexual, relations, as, sinful, and, promote, celibacy, some, religions, require, celibacy, for, certain, roles, such, as, catholic, priests, however, the, catholic, church, also, views, heterosexual, marriage, as, sacred, and, necessary, heteronormativity, denotes, or, relates, to, a, world, view, that, promotes, heterosexuality, as, the, normal, or, preferred, sexual, orientation, for, people, to, have, it, can, assign, strict, gender, roles, to, males, and, females, the, term, was, popularized, by, michael, warner, in, 1991, feminist, adrienne, rich, argues, that, compulsory, heterosexuality, a, continual, and, repeating, reassertion, of, heterosexual, norms, is, a, facet, of, heterosexism, compulsory, heterosexuality, is, the, idea, that, female, heterosexuality, is, both, assumed, and, enforced, by, a, patriarchal, society, heterosexuality, is, then, viewed, as, the, natural, inclination, or, obligation, by, both, sexes, consequently, anyone, who, differs, from, the, normalcy, of, heterosexuality, is, deemed, deviant, or, abhorrent, heterosexism, is, a, form, of, bias, or, discrimination, in, favor, of, opposite, sex, sexuality, and, relationships, it, may, include, an, assumption, that, everyone, is, heterosexual, and, may, involve, various, kinds, of, discrimination, against, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, asexuals, heteroflexible, people, or, transgender, or, non, binary, individuals, straight, pride, is, a, slogan, that, arose, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, and, has, been, used, primarily, by, social, conservative, groups, as, a, political, stance, and, strategy, the, term, is, described, as, a, response, to, gay, pride, adopted, by, various, lgbt, groups, in, the, early, 1970s, or, to, the, accommodations, provided, to, gay, pride, initiatives
