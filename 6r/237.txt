and, physically, intimate, act, in, its, own, right, like, most, forms, of, sexual, activity, oral, sex, can, pose, a, risk, for, contracting, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, however, the, transmission, risk, for, oral, sex, especially, hiv, transmission, is, significantly, lower, than, for, vaginal, or, anal, sex, oral, sex, is, often, regarded, as, taboo, but, most, countries, do, not, have, laws, which, ban, the, practice, commonly, people, do, not, think, of, oral, sex, as, affecting, the, virginity, of, either, partner, though, opinions, on, the, matter, vary, people, may,

is, a, forced, form, of, fellatio, where, one, actively, forces, their, penis, into, the, partner, s, mouth, in, regards, to, masturbation, there, is, autofellatio, a, possible, but, rare, variant, and, autocunnilingus, which, may, be, possible, for, women, with, extremely, flexible, spines, an, act, of, group, sex, restricted, to, one, woman, giving, oral, sex, to, several, men, is, referred, to, as, a, gangsuck, blowbang, or, lineup, all, derivatives, of, the, slang, term, gang, bang, for, group, sex, bukkake, and, gokkun, may, also, involve, oral, sex, oral, sex, may, be, practised, to, preserve, virginity, especially, among, heterosexual, pairings, this, is, sometimes, termed, technical, virginity, which, may, include, anal, sex, manual, sex, and, other, non, penetrative, sex, acts, but, excludes, penile, vaginal, sex, the, concept, of, technical, virginity, or, sexual, abstinence, through, oral, sex, is, popular, among, teenagers, gay, men, who, regard, oral, sex, as, a, way, of, maintaining, their, virginities, view, penile, anal, penetration, as, resulting, in, virginity, loss, while, other, gay, males, may, define, oral, sex, as, their, main, form, of, sexual, activity, by, contrast, lesbian, pairings, commonly, view, oral, sex, or, fingering, as, resulting, in, virginity, loss, though, definitions, of, virginity, loss, vary, among, lesbians, as, well, oral, sex, alone, does, not, result, in, pregnancy, and, heterosexual, couples, may, engage, in, oral, sex, for, contraception, reasons, for, conception, to, take, place, sperm, from, the, penis, must, enter, the, uterus, and, fallopian, tubes, and, fertilize, the, female, s, egg, in, humans, there, is, no, connection, between, the, gastrointestinal, system, and, the, reproductive, system, and, sperm, ingested, by, the, woman, would, be, killed, and, broken, down, by, acids, in, her, stomach, and, proteins, in, the, small, intestine, the, breakdown, products, are, then, absorbed, as, a, negligible, quantity, of, nutrients, however, there, is, a, potential, risk, of, pregnancy, if, semen, comes, in, contact, with, the, vaginal, area, in, some, way, such, as, semen, in, the, ejaculate, finding, its, way, onto, fingers, hands, or, other, body, parts, which, then, comes, in, contact, with, the, vaginal, area, oral, sex, is, not, necessarily, an, effective, method, of, preventing, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, although, some, forms, of, stis, are, believed, to, be, less, commonly, spread, in, this, way, and, oral, sex, has, been, recommended, as, a, form, of, safe, sex, in, the, united, states, no, barrier, methods, for, use, during, oral, sex, have, been, evaluated, as, effective, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, however, a, barrier, protection, like, a, condom, for, fellatio, or, dental, dam, for, cunnilingus, can, offer, some, protection, from, contact, when, practicing, oral, sex, oral, sex, should, be, limited, to, the, protected, areas, a, makeshift, dental, dam, can, be, made, out, of, a, condom, or, a, latex, or, nitrile, glove, but, using, a, real, dental, dam, is, seen, as, preferable, this, is, because, real, dental, dams, cover, a, larger, area, avoid, accidents, caused, by, slipping, outside, the, covered, area, and, avoid, the, risk, that, makeshift, versions, may, be, accidentally, damaged, or, poked, with, the, scissors, during, the, cutting, procedure, plastic, wrap, may, also, be, used, as, a, barrier, during, oral, sex, but, there, exists, no, conclusive, scientific, research, regarding, how, effective, it, may, or, may, not, be, at, preventing, disease, transmission, certain, kinds, of, plastic, wrap, are, manufactured, to, be, microwaveable, and, are, designed, to, have, pores, that, open, when, heated, but, there, also, exists, no, scientific, research, on, what, effect, if, any, this, has, on, disease, transmission, when, used, during, oral, sex, some, people, complain, that, the, thickness, of, the, plastic, dulls, sensation, a, report, issued, by, the, national, center, for, health, statistics, in, 2005, was, the, basis, of, an, article, in, the, 26, september, 2005, issue, of, time, magazine, the, report, comes, from, the, results, of, a, computer, administered, survey, of, over, 12, 000, americans, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 44, and, states, that, over, half, the, teenagers, questioned, have, had, oral, sex, while, some, headlines, have, interpreted, this, as, evidence, that, oral, sex, among, teenagers, is, on, the, rise, this, was, the, first, comprehensive, study, of, its, kind, to, examine, the, matter, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, stated, in, 2009, studies, indicate, that, oral, sex, is, commonly, practiced, by, sexually, active, male, female, and, same, gender, couples, of, various, ages, including, adolescents, research, also, indicates, that, males, are, more, likely, than, females, to, have, received, oral, sex, whereas, equal, proportions, of, men, and, women, have, given, oral, sex, in, a, canadian, study, 89, of, heterosexual, and, bisexual, men, had, practiced, cunnilingus, 94, of, them, enjoyed, it, of, the, latter, 76, practiced, it, often, or, very, often, reasons, for, not, practicing, cunnilingus, included, lack, of, opportunity, 73, and, disgust, 13, this, suggests, that, much, more, than, 89, of, men, would, practice, cunnilingus, if, they, had, a, chance, some, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, such, as, chlamydia, and, human, papillomavirus, hpv, can, be, transmitted, through, oral, sex, any, sexual, exchange, of, bodily, fluids, with, a, person, infected, with, hiv, the, virus, that, causes, aids, poses, a, risk, of, infection, risk, of, sti, infection, however, is, generally, considered, significantly, lower, for, oral, sex, than, for, vaginal, or, anal, sex, with, hiv, transmission, considered, the, lowest, risk, with, regard, to, oral, sex, there, is, an, increased, risk, of, sti, transmission, if, the, receiving, partner, has, wounds, on, their, genitals, or, if, the, giving, partner, has, wounds, or, open, sores, on, or, in, their, mouth, or, bleeding, gums, brushing, the, teeth, flossing, undergoing, dental, work, soon, before, or, after, performing, oral, sex, can, also, increase, the, risk, of, transmission, because, all, of, these, activities, can, cause, small, scratches, in, the, lining, of, the, mouth, these, wounds, even, when, they, are, microscopic, increase, the, chances, of, contracting, stis, that, can, be, transmitted, orally, under, these, conditions, such, contact, can, also, lead, to, more, mundane, infections, from, common, bacteria, and, viruses, found, in, around, and, secreted, from, the, genital, regions, because, of, the, aforementioned, factors, medical, sources, advise, the, use, of, condoms, or, other, effective, barrier, methods, when, performing, or, receiving, oral, sex, with, a, partner, whose, sti, status, is, unknown, links, have, been, reported, between, oral, sex, and, oral, cancer, with, human, papillomavirus, hpv, infected, people, in, 2005, a, research, study, at, malm, university, s, faculty, of, odontology, suggested, that, performing, unprotected, oral, sex, on, a, person, infected, with, hpv, might, increase, the, risk, of, oral, cancer, the, study, found, that, 36, percent, of, the, cancer, patients, had, hpv, compared, to, only, 1, percent, of, the, healthy, control, group, another, study, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, suggests, a, correlation, between, oral, sex, and, throat, cancer, it, is, believed, that, this, is, due, to, the, transmission, of, hpv, a, virus, that, has, been, implicated, in, the, majority, of, cervical, cancers, and, which, has, been, detected, in, throat, cancer, tissue, in, numerous, studies, the, study, concludes, that, people, who, had, one, to, five, oral, sex, partners, in, their, lifetime, had, approximately, a, doubled, risk, of, throat, cancer, compared, with, those, who, never, engaged, in, this, activity, and, those, with, more, than, five, oral, sex, partners, had, a, 250, percent, increased, risk, fellatio, may, reduce, the, risk, of, miscarriages, by, inducing, immunological, tolerance, in, the, woman, by, exposure, to, the, proteins, in, her, partner, s, semen, a, process, known, as, paternal, tolerance, while, any, exposure, to, a, partner, s, semen, appears, to, decrease, a, woman, s, chances, for, the, various, immunological, disorders, that, can, occur, during, pregnancy, immunological, tolerance, could, be, most, quickly, established, through, the, oral, introduction, and, gastrointestinal, absorption, of, semen, recognizing, that, some, of, the, studies, potentially, included, the, presence, of, confounding, factors, such, as, the, possibility, that, women, who, regularly, perform, fellatio, and, swallow, semen, also, engage, in, more, frequent, intercourse, the, researchers, also, noted, that, either, way, the, data, still, overwhelmingly, supports, the, main, theory, behind, all, their, studies, that, repeated, exposure, to, semen, establishes, the, maternal, immunological, tolerance, necessary, for, a, safe, and, successful, pregnancy, cultural, views, on, oral, sex, range, from, aversion, to, high, regard, it, especially, fellatio, has, been, deemed, taboo, or, at, least, discouraged, in, many, cultures, and, parts, of, the, world, laws, of, some, jurisdictions, consider, oral, sex, to, be, penetrative, sex, for, the, purposes, of, sexual, offenses, with, regard, to, the, act, but, most, countries, do, not, have, laws, which, ban, the, practice, itself, in, contrast, to, anal, sex, or, extramarital, sex, in, ancient, rome, fellatio, was, considered, profoundly, taboo, sexual, acts, were, generally, seen, through, the, prism, of, submission, and, control, this, is, apparent, in, the, two, latin, words, for, the, act, irrumare, to, penetrate, orally, and, fellare, to, be, penetrated, orally, under, this, system, it, was, considered, to, be, abhorrent, for, a, male, to, perform, fellatio, since, that, would, mean, that, he, was, penetrated, controlled, whereas, receiving, fellatio, from, a, woman, or, another, man, of, lower, social, status, such, as, a, slave, or, debtor, was, not, humiliating, the, romans, thought, of, oral, sex, as, being, far, more, shameful, than, for, example, anal, sex, known, practitioners, were, supposed, to, have, foul, breath, and, were, often, unwelcome, as, guests, at, a, dinner, table, this, was, highlighted, in, roman, attitudes, towards, irrumatio, in, which, it, was, strictly, considered, a, form, of, oral, rape, and, any, man, who, irrumated, another, person, was, considered, to, be, extremely, virile, irrumatio, was, so, degrading, in, roman, society, in, fact, that, it, was, often, used, as, a, method, of, punishment, in, contrast, to, historical, views, on, fellatio, cunnilingus, is, revered, as, a, spiritually, fulfilling, practice, in, chinese, taoism, which, regards, it, as, having, the, ability, to, enhance, longevity, in, modern, western, culture, oral, sex, is, widely, practiced, among, adolescents, and, adults, people, give, various, reasons, for, their, dislike, of, oral, sex, some, state, that, since, it, does, not, result, in, reproduction, it, is, therefore, unnatural, others, find, it, less, intimate, because, it, is, not, a, face, to, face, practice, or, believe, that, it, is, a, humiliating, or, unclean, practice, that, it, is, humiliating, or, unclean, are, opinions, that, are, at, least, in, some, cases, connected, with, the, symbolism, attached, to, different, parts, of, the, body, opposite, these, views, people, also, believe, that, oral, sex, is, one, of, the, most, intimate, behaviors, that, a, couple, can, engage, in, because, it, requires, total, trust, and, vulnerability, while, commonly, believed, that, lesbian, sexual, practices, involve, cunnilingus, for, all, women, who, have, sex, with, women, wsw, some, have, an, aversion, to, cunnilingus, due, to, not, liking, the, experience, or, psychological, or, social, factors, such, as, finding, it, unclean, other, wsw, believe, that, it, is, a, necessity, or, largely, defines, lesbian, sexual, activity, lesbian, couples, are, more, likely, to, consider, a, woman, s, dislike, of, cunnilingus, as, a, problem, than, heterosexual, couples, are, and, it, is, common, for, them, to, seek, therapy, to, overcome, inhibitions, regarding, it, there, are, many, words, which, refer, to, oral, sex, including, euphemisms, and, sexual, slang, like, all, aspects, of, sexuality, there, exists, a, large, number, of, variations, on, a, theme, a, few, common, ones, being, other, slang, terms, for, oral, sex, include, going, down, on, male, or, female, licking, out, and, muff, diving, female, blow, job, male, dome, male, or, female, sucking, off, male, playing, the,

observed, in, the, animal, kingdom, among, many, species, it, has, been, suggested, that, there, is, an, evolutionary, advantage, due, to, the, tendency, of, primates, non, primates, and, humans, to, have, oral, sex, fellatio, occurs, with, the, fruit, bat, cynopterus, sphinx, it, has, been, observed, when, the, bats, are, mating, these, bat, pairs, spend, more, time, copulating, if, the, female,
