the, 44, categories, early, evidence, of, distillation, comes, from, akkadian, tablets, dated, c, 1200, bc, describing, perfumery, operations, providing, textual, evidence, that, an, early, primitive, form, of, distillation, was, known, to, the, babylonians, of, ancient, mesopotamia, early, evidence, of, distillation, also, comes, from, alchemists, working, in, alexandria, roman, egypt, in, the, 1st, century, distilled, water, was, described, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, by, alexander, of, aphrodisias, alchemists, in, roman, egypt, were, using, a, distillation, alembic, or, still, device, in, the, 3rd, century, distillation, was, known, in, the, ancient, indian, subcontinent, evident, from, baked, clay, retorts, and, receivers, found, at, taxila, and, charsadda, in, pakistan, and, rang, mahal, in, india, dating, to, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, frank, raymond, allchin, says, these, terracotta, distill, tubes, were, made, to, imitate, bamboo, these, gandhara, stills, were, capable, of, producing, only, very, weak, liquor, as, there, was, no, efficient, means, of, collecting, the, vapors, at, low, heat, distillation, in, china, could, have, begun, during, the, eastern, han, dynasty, 1st, 2nd, centuries, but, the, distillation, of, beverages, began, in, the, jin, 12th, 13th, centuries, and, southern, song, 10th, 13th, centuries, dynasties, according, to, archaeological, evidence, freeze, distillation, involves, freezing, the, alcoholic, beverage, and, then, removing, the, ice, the, freezing, technique, had, limitations, in, geography, and, implementation, limiting, how, widely, this, method, was, put, to, use, the, flammable, nature, of, the, exhalations, of, wine, was, already, known, to, ancient, natural, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, theophrastus, c, 371, c, 287, bce, and, pliny, the, elder, 23, 24, 79, ce, this, did, not, immediately, lead, to, the, isolation, of, alcohol, however, despite, the, development, of, more, advanced, distillation, techniques, in, second, and, third, century, roman, egypt, an, important, recognition, first, found, in, one, of, the, writings, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, ninth, century, ce, was, that, by, adding, salt, to, boiling, wine, which, increases, the, wine, s, relative, volatility, the, flammability, of, the, resulting, vapors, may, be, enhanced, the, distillation, of, wine, is, attested, in, arabic, works, attributed, to, al, kind, c, 801, 873, ce, and, to, al, f, r, b, c, 872, 950, and, in, the, 28th, book, of, al, zahr, w, s, latin,

hebei, dating, to, the, 12th, century, in, india, the, true, distillation, of, alcohol, was, introduced, from, the, middle, east, and, was, in, wide, use, in, the, delhi, sultanate, by, the, 14th, century, the, works, of, taddeo, alderotti, 1223, 1296, describe, a, method, for, concentrating, alcohol, involving, repeated, fractional, distillation, through, a, water, cooled, still, by, which, an, alcohol, purity, of, 90, could, be, obtained, in, 1437, burned, water, brandy, was, mentioned, in, the, records, of, the, county, of, katzenelnbogen, in, germany, it, is, legal, to, distill,
