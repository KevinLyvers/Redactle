characterized, by, the, use, of, a, significant, amount, of, sugar, or, sugar, substitutes, unlike, a, cake, or, loaf, of, bread, that, would, be, shared, among, many, people, candies, are, usually, made, in, smaller, pieces, however, the, definition, of, candy, also, depends, upon, how, people, treat, the, food, unlike, sweet, pastries, served, for, a, dessert, course, at, the, end, of, a, meal, candies, are, normally, eaten, casually, often, with, the, fingers, as, a, snack, between, meals, each, culture, has, its, own, ideas, of, what, constitutes, candy, rather, than, dessert, the, same, food, may, be, a, candy, in, one, culture, and, a, dessert, in, another, the, word, candy, entered, the, english, language, from, the, old, french, ucre, candi, sugar, candy, the, french, term, probably, has, earlier, roots, in, the, arabic, qandi, persian, qand, and, sanskrit, khanda, all, words, for, sugar, sugarcane, is, indigenous, to, tropical, south, and, southeast, asia, pieces, of, sugar, were, produced, by, boiling, sugarcane, juice, in, ancient, india, and, consumed, as, khanda, between, the, 6th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, the, persians, followed, by, the, greeks, discovered, the, people, in, india, and, their, reeds, that, produce, honey, without, bees, they, adopted, and, then, spread, sugar, and, sugarcane, agriculture, before, sugar, was, readily, available, candy, was, based, on, honey, honey, was, used, in, ancient, china, the, middle, east, egypt, greece, and, the, roman, empire, to, coat, fruits, and, flowers, to, preserve, them, or, to, create, forms, of, candy, candy, is, still, served, in, this, form, today, though, now, it, is, more, typically, seen, as, a, type, of, garnish, before, the, industrial, revolution, candy, was, often, considered, a, form, of, medicine, either, used, to, calm, the, digestive, system, or, cool, a, sore, throat, in, the, middle, ages, candy, appeared, on, the, tables, of, only, the, most, wealthy, at, first, at, that, time, it, began, as, a, combination, of, spices, and, sugar, used, as, an, aid, to, digestion, banquet, hosts, typically, served, these, types, of, candies, at, banquets, for, their, guests, one, of, these, candies, sometimes, called, chamber, spice, was, made, with, cloves, ginger, aniseed, juniper, berries, almonds, and, pine, kernels, dipped, in, melted, sugar, the, middle, english, word, candy, began, to, be, used, in, the, late, 13th, century, the, first, candy, came, to, america, during, the, early, 18th, century, from, britain, and, france, only, a, few, of, the, early, colonists, were, proficient, in, sugar, work, and, sugary, treats, were, generally, only, enjoyed, by, the, very, wealthy, even, the, simplest, form, of, candy, rock, candy, made, from, crystallized, sugar, was, considered, a, luxury, the, candy, business, underwent, a, drastic, change, in, the, 1830s, when, technological, advances, and, the, availability, of, sugar, opened, up, the, market, the, new, market, was, not, only, for, the, enjoyment, of, the, rich, but, also, for, the, pleasure, of, the, working, class, there, was, also, an, increasing, market, for, children, while, some, fine, confectioners, remained, the, candy, store, became, a, favorite, of, the, child, of, the, american, working, class, penny, candies, epitomized, this, transformation, of, candy, penny, candy, became, the, first, material, good, that, children, spent, their, own, money, on, for, this, reason, candy, store, owners, relied, almost, entirely, on, the, business, of, children, to, keep, them, running, even, penny, candies, were, directly, descended, from, medicated, lozenges, that, held, bitter, medicine, in, a, hard, sugar, coating, in, 1847, the, invention, of, the, candy, press, also, known, under, the, surprising, name, of, a, toy, machine, made, it, possible, to, produce, multiple, shapes, and, sizes, of, candy, at, once, in, 1851, confectioners, began, to, use, a, revolving, steam, pan, to, assist, in, boiling, sugar, this, transformation, meant, that, the, candy, maker, was, no, longer, required, to, continuously, stir, the, boiling, sugar, the, heat, from, the, surface, of, the, pan, was, also, much, more, evenly, distributed, and, made, it, less, likely, the, sugar, would, burn, these, innovations, made, it, possible, for, only, one, or, two, people, to, successfully, run, a, candy, business, as, the, path, from, producer, to, market, became, increasingly, complicated, many, foods, were, affected, by, adulteration, and, the, addition, of, additives, which, ranged, from, relatively, harmless, ingredients, such, as, cheap, cornstarch, and, corn, syrup, to, poisonous, ones, some, manufacturers, produced, bright, colors, in, candy, by, the, addition, of, hazardous, substances, for, which, there, was, no, legal, regulation, green, chromium, iii, oxide, and, copper, acetate, red, lead, ii, iv, oxide, and, mercury, sulfide, yellow, lead, chromate, and, white, chalk, arsenic, trioxide, in, an, 1885, cover, cartoon, for, puck, joseph, keppler, satirized, the, dangers, of, additives, in, candy, by, depicting, the, mutual, friendship, between, striped, candy, doctors, and, gravediggers, by, 1906, research, into, the, dangers, of, additives, expos, s, of, the, food, industry, and, public, pressure, led, to, the, passage, of, the, pure, food, and, drug, act, the, first, federal, united, states, law, to, regulate, food, and, drugs, including, candy, sugar, candies, include, hard, candies, soft, candies, caramels, marshmallows, taffy, and, other, candies, whose, principal, ingredient, is, sugar, commercially, sugar, candies, are, often, divided, into, groups, according, to, the, amount, of, sugar, they, contain, and, their, chemical, structure, hard, boiled, candies, made, by, the, vacuum, cooking, process, include, stick, candy, lemon, drops, and, horehound, drops, open, fire, candy, like, molasses, taffy, and, cream, taffy, is, cooked, in, open, kettles, and, then, pulled, pan, work, candies, include, nuts, and, other, candies, like, jelly, beans, and, sugar, coated, almonds, made, by, coating, with, sugar, in, revolving, copper, kettles, gum, work, candy, is, cooked, in, large, kettles, fashioned, for, melting, and, molded, dried, and, sugared, like, gum, drops, they, are, soaked, for, a, time, in, sugar, syrup, to, allow, crystals, to, form, sugar, candies, can, be, classified, into, noncrystalline, and, crystalline, types, noncrystalline, candies, are, homogeneous, and, may, be, chewy, or, hard, they, include, hard, candies, caramels, toffees, and, nougats, crystalline, candies, incorporate, small, crystals, in, their, structure, are, creamy, that, melt, in, the, mouth, or, are, easily, chewed, they, include, fondant, and, fudge, in, 2022, flavorless, candy, was, developed, that, was, hard, but, not, sweet, chocolate, is, sometimes, treated, as, a, separate, branch, of, confectionery, in, this, model, chocolate, candies, like, chocolate, candy, bars, and, chocolate, truffles, are, included, hot, chocolate, or, other, cocoa, based, drinks, are, excluded, as, is, candy, made, from, white, chocolate, when, chocolate, is, treated, as, a, separate, branch, it, also, includes, confections, whose, classification, is, otherwise, difficult, being, neither, exactly, candies, nor, exactly, baked, goods, like, chocolate, dipped, foods, tarts, with, chocolate, shells, and, chocolate, coated, cookies, sugar, candy, is, made, by, dissolving, sugar, in, water, or, milk, to, form, a, syrup, which, is, boiled, until, it, reaches, the, desired, concentration, or, starts, to, caramelize, candy, comes, in, a, wide, variety, of, textures, from, soft, and, chewy, to, hard, and, brittle, the, texture, of, candy, depends, on, the, ingredients, and, the, temperatures, that, the, candy, is, processed, at, the, final, texture, of, sugar, candy, depends, primarily, on, the, concentration, of, sugar, as, the, syrup, is, heated, it, boils, water, evaporates, the, sugar, concentration, increases, and, the, boiling, point, rises, a, given, temperature, corresponds, to, a, particular, sugar, concentration, these, are, called, sugar, stages, in, general, higher, temperatures, and, greater, sugar, concentrations, result, in, hard, brittle, candies, and, lower, temperatures, result, in, softer, candies, once, the, syrup, reaches, 171, c, 340, f, or, higher, the, sucrose, molecules, break, down, into, many, simpler, sugars, creating, an, amber, colored, substance, known, as, caramel, this, should, not, be, confused, with, caramel, candy, although, it, is, the, candy, s, main, flavoring, most, candies, are, made, commercially, the, industry, relies, significantly, on, trade, secret, protection, because, candy, recipes, cannot, be, copyrighted, or, patented, effectively, but, are, very, difficult, to, duplicate, exactly, seemingly, minor, differences, in, the, machinery, temperature, or, timing, of, the, candy, making, process, can, cause, noticeable, differences, in, the, final, product, candy, wrapper, or, sweets, wrapper, is, a, common, term, for, this, packaging, packaging, preserves, aroma, and, flavor, and, eases, shipping, and, dispensation, wax, paper, seals, against, air, moisture, dust, and, germs, while, cellophane, is, valued, by, packagers, for, its, transparency, and, resistance, to, grease, odors, and, moisture, in, addition, it, is, often, resealable, polyethylene, is, another, form, of, film, sealed, with, heat, and, this, material, is, often, used, to, make, bags, in, bulk, packaging, plastic, wraps, are, also, common, aluminum, foils, wrap, chocolate, bars, and, prevent, a, transfer, of, water, vapor, while, being, lightweight, non, toxic, and, odor, proof, vegetable, parchment, lines, boxes, of, high, quality, confections, like, gourmet, chocolates, cardboard, cartons, are, less, common, though, they, offer, many, options, concerning, thickness, and, movement, of, water, and, oil, packages, are, often, sealed, with, a, starch, based, adhesive, derived, from, tapioca, potato, wheat, sago, or, sweet, potato, occasionally, glues, are, made, from, the, bones, and, skin, of, cattle, and, hogs, for, a, stronger, and, more, flexible, product, but, this, is, not, as, common, because, of, the, expense, prior, to, the, 1900s, candy, was, commonly, sold, unwrapped, from, carts, in, the, street, where, it, was, exposed, to, dirt, and, insects, by, 1914, there, were, some, machines, to, wrap, gum, and, stick, candies, but, this, was, not, the, common, practice, after, the, polio, outbreak, in, 1916, unwrapped, candies, garnered, widespread, censure, because, of, the, dirt, and, germs, at, the, time, only, upscale, candy, stores, used, glass, jars, with, advancements, in, technology, wax, paper, was, adopted, and, foil, and, cellophane, were, imported, to, the, u, s, from, france, by, dupont, in, 1925, necco, packagers, were, one, of, the, first, companies, to, package, without, human, touch, kiosks, and, vending, machines, were, introduced, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, candy, packaging, played, a, role, in, its, adoption, as, the, most, popular, treat, given, away, during, trick, or, treating, for, halloween, in, the, us, in, the, 1940s, most, treats, were, homemade, during, the, 1950s, small, individually, wrapped, candies, were, recognized, as, convenient, and, inexpensive, by, the, 1970s, after, widely, publicized, but, largely, false, stories, of, poisoned, candy, myths, circulating, in, the, popular, press, factory, sealed, packaging, with, a, recognizable, name, brand, on, it, became, a, sign, of, safety, packaging, helps, market, the, product, as, well, manufacturers, know, that, candy, must, be, hygienic, and, attractive, to, customers, in, the, children, s, market, quantity, novelty, large, size, and, bright, colors, are, the, top, sellers, many, companies, redesign, the, packaging, to, maintain, consumer, appeal, because, of, its, high, sugar, concentration, bacteria, are, not, usually, able, to, grow, in, candy, as, a, result, the, shelf, life, is, longer, for, candy, than, for, many, other, foods, most, candies, can, be, safely, stored, in, their, original, packaging, at, room, temperature, in, a, dry, dark, cupboard, for, months, or, years, as, a, rule, the, softer, the, candy, or, the, damper, the, storage, area, the, sooner, it, goes, stale, shelf, life, considerations, with, most, candies, are, focused, on, appearance, taste, and, texture, rather, than, about, the, potential, for, food, poisoning, that, is, old, candy, may, not, look, appealing, or, taste, very, good, even, though, it, is, very, unlikely, to, make, the, eater, sick, candy, can, be, made, unsafe, by, storing, it, badly, such, as, in, a, wet, moldy, area, typical, recommendations, are, these, most, sugar, candies, are, defined, in, us, law, as, a, food, of, minimal, nutritional, value, even, in, a, culture, that, eats, sweets, frequently, candy, is, not, a, significant, source, of, nutrition, or, food, energy, for, most, people, the, average, american, eats, about, 1, 1, kg, 2, 5, pounds, of, sugar, or, similar, sweeteners, each, week, but, almost, 95, of, that, sugar, all, but, about, 70, grams, 2, 5, ounces, comes, from, non, candy, sources, especially, soft, drinks, and, processed, foods, candy, is, considered, a, source, of, empty, calories, because, it, provides, little, or, no, nutritional, value, beyond, food, energy, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, when, undernutrition, was, a, serious, problem, especially, among, poor, and, working, class, people, and, when, nutrition, science, was, a, new, field, the, high, calorie, content, was, promoted, as, a, virtue, researchers, suggested, that, candy, especially, candy, made, with, milk, and, nuts, was, a, low, cost, alternative, to, normal, meals, to, get, the, food, energy, necessary, for, a, day, of, labor, candy, might, cost, half, as, much, as, eggs, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, candy, bars, selling, for, five, cents, were, often, marketed, as, replacements, for, lunch, at, the, 1904, world, fair, the, quaker, oats, company, made, a, candy, coated, puffed, cereal, a, wheat, based, product, similar, to, cracker, jack, s, candy, coated, popcorn, the, product, concept, was, re, introduced, unsuccessfully, in, 1939, by, another, business, as, ranger, joe, the, first, pre, sweetened, candy, coated, breakfast, cereal, post, foods, introduced, their, own, version, in, 1948, originally, called, happy, jax, and, later, sugar, crisp, they, marketed, it, as, both, a, replacement, for, unsweetened, breakfast, cereals, and, also, for, eating, as, a, snack, or, as, candy, using, three, animated, cartoon, bears, as, the, mascots, candy, handy, and, dandy, the, early, slogans, said, as, a, cereal, it, s, dandy, for, snacks, it, s, so, handy, or, eat, it, like, candy, in, more, recent, times, a, variety, of, snack, bars, have, been, marketed, these, include, bars, that, are, intended, as, meal, replacements, as, well, as, snack, bars, that, are, marketed, as, having, nutritional, advantages, when, compared, to, candy, bars, such, as, granola, bars, however, the, actual, nutritional, value, is, often, not, very, different, from, candy, bars, except, for, usually, a, higher, sodium, content, and, the, flavors, most, popularly, chocolate, fudge, and, caramel, and, the, presentation, mimic, candy, bars, among, the, bengali, people, candy, may, be, eaten, for, an, entire, meal, especially, during, festivals, candy, may, also, be, offered, to, vegetarian, guests, in, lieu, of, fish, or, meat, dishes, in, india, most, candy, contains, no, meat, or, other, animal, parts, and, many, contain, no, milk, or, other, animal, products, some, candy, including, marshmallows, and, gummi, bears, contains, gelatin, derived, from, animal, collagen, a, protein, found, in, skin, and, bones, and, is, thus, avoided, by, vegans, and, some, vegetarians, kosher, gelatin, is, also, unsuitable, for, vegetarians, and, vegans, as, it, is, derived, from, fish, bones, other, substances, such, as, agar, pectin, starch, and, gum, arabic, may, also, be, used, as, setting, and, gelling, agents, and, can, be, used, in, place, of, gelatin, other, ingredients, commonly, found, in, candy, that, are, not, suitable, for, vegetarian, or, vegan, diets, include, carmine, a, red, dye, made, from, cochineal, beetles, and, confectioner, s, glaze, which, contains, shellac, a, resin, excreted, by, female, lac, bugs, candy, generally, contains, sugar, which, is, a, key, environmental, factor, in, the, formation, of, dental, caries, cavities, several, types, of, bacteria, commonly, found, in, the, mouth, consume, sugar, particularly, streptococcus, mutans, when, these, bacteria, metabolize, the, sugar, found, in, most, candies, juice, or, other, sugary, foods, they, produce, acids, in, the, mouth, that, demineralize, the, tooth, enamel, and, can, lead, to, dental, caries, heavy, or, frequent, consumption, of, high, sugar, foods, especially, lollipops, sugary, cough, drops, and, other, sugar, based, candies, that, stay, in, the, mouth, for, a, long, time, increases, the, risk, of, tooth, decay, candies, that, also, contain, enamel, dissolving, acids, such, as, acid, drops, increase, the, risk, cleaning, the, teeth, and, mouth, shortly, after, eating, any, type, of, sugary, food, and, allowing, several, hours, to, pass, between, eating, such, foods, reduces, the, risk, and, improves, oral, health, however, frequent, consumption, of, fruits, and, fruit, juice, which, contain, both, acid, and, sugars, may, be, a, more, significant, factor, in, dental, decay, than, candies, the, link, between, candy, and, caries, was, formally, identified, through, the, vipeholm, experiments, where, intellectually, disabled, people, were, fed, copious, amounts, of, candy, and, were, found, to, develop, poor, dental, health, the, experiments, are, today, considered, to, have, violated, multiple, principles, of, medical, ethics, most, candy, particularly, low, fat, and, fat, free, candy, has, a, high, glycemic, index, gi, which, means, that, it, causes, a, rapid, rise, in, blood, sugar, levels, after, ingestion, this, is, chiefly, a, concern, for, people, with, diabetes, but, could, also, be, dangerous, to, the, health, of, non, diabetics, some, kinds, of, candy, have, been, contaminated, with, an, excessive, amount, of, lead, in, it, claims, of, contamination, have, been, made, since, shortly, after, industrial, scale, candy, factories, began, producing, candy, in, the, mid, 19th, century, although, these, early, claims, were, rarely, true, contamination, by, infectious, agents, such, as, virus, or, bacteria, is, unlikely, through, sweets, including, unwrapped, sweets, this, is, in, part, because, bacteria, can, not, replicate, in, the, very, dry, and, sweet, environment, of, candy, hard, round, candies, are, a, leading, cause, of, choking, deaths, in, children, some, types, of, candy, such, as, lychee, mini, fruity, gels, have, been, associated, with, so, many, choking, deaths, that, their, import, or, manufacture, is, banned, by, some, countries, non, nutritive, toy, products, such, as, chocolate, eggs, containing, packaging, with, a, toy, inside, are, banned, from, sale, in, the, us, if, the, material, attached, to, confectionery, has, a, function, and, will, not, cause, any, injury, to, the, consumer, it, is, allowed, to, be, marketed, in, the, eu, however, the, toy, safety, directive, 2009, 48, ec, specifies, that, toys, contained, in, food, only, need, separate, packaging, that, cannot, be, swallowed, global, sales, of, candies, were, estimated, to, have, been, approximately, us, 118, billion, in, 2012, in, the, united, states, 2, is, spent, on, chocolate, for, every, 1, spent, on, non, chocolate, candy, because, each, culture, varies, in, how, it, treats, some, foods, a, food, may, be, considered, a, candy, in, one, place, and, a, dessert, in, another, for, example, in, western, countries, baklava, is, served, on, a, plate, and, eaten, with, a, fork, as, a, dessert, but, in, the, middle, east, northern, africa, and, eastern, europe, it, is, treated, as, a, candy, candy, is, the, source, of, several, cultural, themes, adults, worry, that, other, people, will, use, candy, to, poison, or, entice, children, into, harmful, situations, stranger, danger, warnings, include, telling, children, not, to, take, candy, from, strangers, for, fear, of, the, child, being, abducted, poisoned, candy, myths, persist, in, popular, culture, especially, around, trick, or, treating, at, halloween, despite, the, rarity, of, actual, incidents, the, phrase, like, taking, candy, from, a, baby, is, a, common, simile, and, means, that, something, is, very, easy, to, do, a, 1959, swedish, dental, health, campaign, encouraged, people, to, reduce, the, risk, of, dental, problems, by, limiting, consumption, of, candy, to, once, a, week, the, slogan, all, the, sweets, you, want, but, only, once, a, week, started, a, tradition, of, buying, candy, every, saturday, called, l, rdagsgodis, literally, saturday, candy, to, this, day, the, process, of, going, door, to, door, to, receive, free, candy, during, halloween, time, has, become, a, major, draw, for, children, all, across, america, children, across, the, country, dress, up, in, costume, and, go, door, to, door, in, turn, the, residents, of, each, house, graciously, buy, candy, for, children, and, hand, it, out, in, small, increments, just, as, it, had, been, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, main, form, of, candy, that, is, passed, out, is, pre, packaged, sweets, parents, feel, much, more, easy, minded, allowing, their, children, to, eat, pre, packaged, candies, because, of, the, quality, control, that, comes, with, each, product, as, a, result, name, brand, candies, have, become, a, staple, for, halloween, and, trick, or, treating, up, to, the, present, some, candies, continue, to, be, popular, with, trick, or, treaters, such, as, reese, s, cups, kit, kat, and, snickers, which, were, the, top, three, halloween, candies, of, 2022, the, tradition, of, handing, out, treats, on, halloween, originated, from, the, holiday, of, all, hallows, day, or, all, saints, day, which, derives, from, christian, tradition, on, this, day, children, would, travel, across, town, saying, prayers, along, the, way, these, children, prayed, mainly, for, all, people, who, had, died, in, between, their, prayers, these, children, would, also, arrive, at, the, doorsteps, of, people, within, their, town, as, a, reward, for, their, actions, they, were, given, homemade, cakes, referred, to, as, soul, cakes, made, by, the, homeowners, these, soul, cakes, resembled, a, form, of, biscuit, and, were, usually, filled, with, raisins, or, cinnamon, among, other, ingredients, many, cakes, were, also, given, to, the, poor, during, this, time, the, soul, cakes, gave, these, children, the, incentive, to, pray, intensely, in, exchange, for, sweets, the, idea, of, providing, trick, or, treaters, with, candy, was, not, fully, conceptualized, until, the, 1950s, up, until, that, point, many, households, continued, to, provide, children, with, soul, cakes, among, other, homemade, goods, however, it, was, discovered, by, numerous, candy, producers, that, the, holiday, of, halloween, could, be, marketed, to, sell, their, products, as, a, result, many, households, began, to, buy, candy, products, the, main, draw, to, these, candy, products, were, that, they, were, inexpensive, took, no, time, to, prepare, and, came, in, bulk, nevertheless, candy, would, not, completely, take, over, until, the, 1970s, up, until, that, point, givers, would, continue, to, make, treats, or, package, small, toys, and, coins, specifically, for, halloween, the, main, cause, for, the, shift, from, homemade, treats, to, pre, packaged, candies, was, the, result, of, speculation, concerning, tampered, food, many, parents, during, this, time, were, concerned, that, their, children, were, being, exposed, to, needles, or, toxic, chemicals, within, their, halloween, goods, the, lack, of, packaging, made, it, much, easier, for, a, person, to, put, dangerous, substances, into, the, food, they, were, planning, to, give, out, these, worries, were, heightened, because, of, a, large, number, of, false, reports, concerning, medical, attention, relating, to, dangerous, halloween, treats, as, a, result, parents, became, much, more, likely, to, allow, their, children, to, participate, in, halloween, festivities, when, packed, candy, was, introduced, they, noticed, that, it, would, be, much, harder, for, a, person, to, tamper, with, factory, packaged, sweets, because, the, seal, would, be, torn, it, would, be, too, noticeable, if, someone, tried, to, affect, the, product, judging, from, recent, statistics, it, is, evident, that, halloween, candy, is, still, at, high, demand, in, 2021, alone, profits, from, halloween, candy, were, up, to, at, least, 324, million, from, the, same, report, the, demand, for, halloween, candy, was, up, 59, 8, from, 2019, from, these, numbers, it, can, be, presumed, that, halloween, is, still, a, big, deal, for, americans, an, even, bigger, deal, for, the, american, public, is, the, act, of, receiving, candy, from, trick, or, treating, candy, continues, to, be, a, staple, for, the, halloween, season, and, remains, the, biggest, draw, for, participation
