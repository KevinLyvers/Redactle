nudity, is, the, state, of, being, in, which, a, human, is, without, clothing, while, estimates, vary, for, the, first, 90, 000, years, of, pre, history, anatomically, modern, humans, were, naked, having, lost, their, body, hair, and, living, in, hospitable, climates, as, humans, became, behaviorally, modern, body, adornments, such, as, jewelry, tattoos, body, paint, and, scarification, became, part, of, non, verbal, communications, indicating, a, person, s, social, and, individual, characteristics, indigenous, peoples, in, warm, climates, used, clothing, for, decorative, symbolic, or, ceremonial, purposes, but, were, often, nude, having, neither, the, need, to, protect, the, body, from, the, elements, nor, any, conception, of, nakedness, being, shameful, in, many, societies, both, ancient, and, contemporary, children, might, be, naked, until, the, beginning, of, puberty, women, may, not, cover, their, breasts, being, associated, with, nursing, babies, more, than, with, sexuality, in, the, ancient, civilizations, of, the, mediterranean, from, mesopotamia, to, the, roman, empire, proper, attire, was, required, to, maintain, social, standing, the, lower, classes, might, possess, a, single, piece, of, cloth, that, was, wrapped, or, tied, to, cover, the, lower, body, the, lowest, classes, including, slaves, might, be, naked, however, through, much, of, western, history, until, the, modern, era, people, of, any, status, were, also, unclothed, by, necessity, or, convenience, when, engaged, in, labor, and, athletics, or, when, bathing, or, swimming, such, functional, nudity, occurred, in, groups, that, were, usually, but, not, always, segregated, by, sex, although, improper, dress, might, be, socially, embarrassing, the, association, of, nudity, with, sin, regarding, sexuality, began, with, judeo, christian, societies, spreading, through, europe, in, the, post, classical, period, traditional, clothing, in, temperate, regions, worldwide, also, reflect, concerns, for, maintaining, social, status, and, order, as, well, as, by, necessity, due, to, the, colder, climate, however, societies, such, as, japan, and, finland, maintain, traditions, of, communal, nudity, based, upon, the, use, of, baths, and, saunas, that, provided, alternatives, to, sexualization, the, spread, of, western, concepts, of, modest, dress, was, part, of, colonialism, and, continues, today, with, globalization, contemporary, social, norms, regarding, nudity, reflect, cultural, ambiguity, towards, the, body, and, sexuality, and, differing, conceptions, of, what, constitutes, public, versus, private, spaces, norms, relating, to, nudity, are, different, for, men, than, they, are, for, women, individuals, may, intentionally, violate, norms, relating, to, nudity, those, without, power, may, use, nudity, as, a, form, of, protest, and, those, with, power, may, impose, nakedness, on, others, as, a, form, of, punishment, while, the, majority, of, contemporary, societies, require, clothing, in, public, some, recognize, non, sexual, nudity, as, being, appropriate, for, some, recreational, social, or, celebratory, activities, and, appreciate, nudity, in, the, arts, as, representing, positive, values, a, minority, within, many, countries, assert, the, benefits, of, social, nudity, while, other, groups, continue, to, disapprove, of, nudity, not, only, in, public, but, also, in, private, based, upon, religious, beliefs, norms, are, codified, to, varying, degrees, by, laws, defining, proper, dress, and, indecent, exposure, in, general, english, usage, nude, and, naked, are, often, synonyms, for, a, human, being, unclothed, but, take, on, many, meanings, in, particular, contexts, nude, derives, from, norman, french, while, naked, is, from, the, anglo, saxon, to, be, naked, is, more, straightforward, not, being, properly, dressed, or, if, stark, naked, entirely, without, clothes, nudity, has, more, cultural, connotations, and, particularly, in, the, fine, arts, positive, associations, with, the, beauty, of, the, human, body, further, synonyms, and, euphemisms, for, nudity, abound, including, birthday, suit, in, the, altogether, and, in, the, buff, partial, nudity, may, be, defined, as, not, covering, the, genitals, or, other, parts, of, the, body, deemed, sexual, such, as, the, buttocks, or, female, breasts, two, human, evolutionary, processes, are, significant, regarding, nudity, first, the, biological, evolution, of, early, hominids, from, being, covered, in, fur, to, being, effectively, hairless, followed, by, the, sociocultural, evolution, of, adornments, and, clothing, in, the, past, there, have, been, several, theories, regarding, why, humans, lost, their, fur, but, the, need, to, dissipate, body, heat, remains, the, most, widely, accepted, evolutionary, explanation, less, hair, and, an, increase, in, eccrine, sweating, made, it, easier, for, early, humans, to, cool, their, bodies, when, they, moved, from, living, in, shady, forest, to, open, savanna, the, ability, to, dissipate, excess, body, heat, was, one, of, the, things, that, made, possible, the, dramatic, enlargement, of, the, brain, the, most, temperature, sensitive, human, organ, some, of, the, technology, for, what, is, now, called, clothing, may, have, originated, to, make, other, types, of, adornment, including, jewelry, body, paint, tattoos, and, other, body, modifications, dressing, the, naked, body, without, concealing, it, according, to, mark, leary, and, nicole, buttermore, body, adornment, is, one, of, the, changes, that, occurred, in, the, late, paleolithic, 40, 000, to, 60, 000, years, ago, in, which, humans, became, not, only, anatomically, modern, but, also, behaviorally, modern, and, capable, of, self, reflection, and, symbolic, interaction, more, recent, studies, place, the, use, of, adornment, at, 77, 000, years, ago, in, south, africa, and, 90, 000, 100, 000, years, ago, in, israel, and, algeria, while, modesty, is, a, factor, often, overlooked, purposes, for, body, coverings, are, camouflage, used, by, hunters, body, armor, and, costumes, used, to, impersonate, spirit, beings, the, current, empirical, evidence, for, the, origin, of, clothing, is, from, a, 2010, study, published, in, molecular, biology, and, evolution, that, study, indicates, that, the, habitual, wearing, of, clothing, began, at, some, point, in, time, between, 170, 000, and, 83, 000, years, ago, based, upon, a, genetic, analysis, indicating, when, clothing, lice, diverged, from, their, head, louse, ancestors, a, 2017, study, published, in, science, estimated, that, anatomically, modern, humans, evolved, 350, 000, to, 260, 000, years, ago, thus, humans, were, naked, in, prehistory, for, at, least, 90, 000, years, the, habitual, use, of, clothing, is, one, of, the, changes, that, mark, the, end, of, the, neolithic, and, the, beginning, of, civilization, between, 7, 000, and, 9, 000, years, ago, much, of, what, is, known, about, the, early, history, of, clothing, is, from, depictions, of, the, higher, classes, there, being, few, surviving, artifacts, everyday, behaviors, are, rarely, represented, in, historical, records, clothing, and, adornment, became, part, of, the, symbolic, communication, that, marked, a, person, s, membership, in, their, society, thus, nakedness, meant, being, at, the, bottom, of, the, social, scale, lacking, in, dignity, and, status, in, each, culture, ornamentation, represented, the, wearer, s, place, in, society, position, of, authority, economic, class, gender, role, and, marital, status, from, the, beginning, of, civilization, there, was, ambiguity, regarding, everyday, nakedness, and, the, nudity, in, depictions, of, deities, and, heroes, indicating, positive, meanings, of, the, unclothed, body, the, social, humiliation, of, nakedness, was, not, associated, with, sin, or, shame, regarding, sexuality, which, was, unique, to, judeo, christian, societies, for, millennia, from, mesopotamia, to, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, the, majority, of, men, and, women, wore, a, cloth, wrapped, or, tied, to, cover, the, lower, part, of, the, body, both, men, and, women, would, be, bare, chested, and, barefoot, complete, nakedness, was, embarrassing, due, to, the, social, connotations, of, low, status, and, deprivation, rather, than, shame, regarding, sexuality, slaves, might, not, be, provided, with, clothing, other, workers, would, be, naked, while, performing, many, tasks, particularly, if, hot, dirty, or, wet, farmers, fishermen, herders, and, those, working, close, to, fires, or, ovens, only, the, upper, classes, were, habitually, dressed, it, was, not, until, the, later, periods, in, particular, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, 1550, 1069, bce, that, functionaries, in, the, households, of, the, wealthy, began, wearing, refined, dress, and, upper, class, women, wore, elaborate, dresses, and, ornamentation, which, covered, their, breasts, these, later, styles, are, often, shown, in, film, and, tv, as, representing, ancient, egypt, in, all, periods, male, nudity, was, celebrated, in, ancient, greece, to, a, greater, degree, than, any, culture, before, or, since, the, status, of, freedom, maleness, privilege, and, physical, virtues, were, asserted, by, discarding, everyday, clothing, for, athletic, nudity, nudity, became, a, ritual, costume, by, association, of, the, naked, body, with, the, beauty, and, power, of, the, gods, who, were, depicted, as, perfect, naked, humans, in, etruscan, and, early, roman, athletics, in, which, masculinity, involved, prudishness, and, paranoia, about, effeminacy, the, greek, traditions, were, not, maintained, because, public, nudity, became, associated, with, homoeroticism, in, the, roman, empire, 27, bce, 476, ce, the, status, of, the, upper, classes, was, such, that, nudity, was, of, no, concern, for, men, and, for, women, only, if, seen, by, their, social, superiors, at, the, roman, baths, thermae, which, had, social, functions, similar, to, a, modern, beach, mixed, nude, bathing, may, have, been, the, norm, up, to, the, fourth, century, ce, the, encounter, between, the, indigenous, cultures, of, africa, the, americas, and, oceania, with, europeans, had, a, significant, effect, on, all, cultures, because, clothing, and, body, adornments, are, such, an, important, part, of, cultural, meaning, the, relative, lack, of, body, coverings, was, one, of, the, first, things, explorers, noticed, when, they, encountered, indigenous, peoples, of, the, tropics, non, western, cultures, during, the, period, were, naked, only, by, comparison, to, western, norms, the, genitals, or, entire, lower, body, of, adults, were, covered, by, garments, in, most, situations, while, the, upper, body, of, both, men, and, women, might, be, unclothed, however, lacking, the, western, concept, of, shame, regarding, the, body, such, garments, might, be, removed, in, public, for, practical, or, ceremonial, purposes, children, until, puberty, and, sometimes, women, until, marriage, might, be, naked, all, humans, lived, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, until, 20, 000, years, ago, and, they, were, naked, in, the, tropical, regions, of, africa, australia, the, americas, and, southeast, asia, this, way, of, life, continued, until, a, few, hundred, years, ago, perhaps, the, last, uncontacted, hunter, gatherers, are, the, community, of, a, few, hundred, individuals, on, one, of, the, andaman, islands, the, europeans, who, first, contacted, tropical, peoples, reported, that, they, were, unashamedly, naked, only, occasionally, wrapping, themselves, in, capes, in, colder, weather, many, pastoral, societies, in, warmer, climates, are, also, minimally, clothed, or, naked, while, working, this, practice, continued, when, western, clothing, was, first, introduced, for, example, aboriginal, australians, in, 1819, wore, only, the, jackets, they, were, given, but, not, pants, western, ambivalence, could, be, expressed, by, responding, to, the, nakedness, of, natives, as, either, a, sign, of, rampant, sexuality, or, of, the, innocence, that, preceded, the, fall, of, man, norms, related, to, nudity, are, associated, with, norms, regarding, personal, freedom, human, sexuality, and, gender, roles, which, vary, widely, among, contemporary, societies, situations, where, private, or, public, nudity, is, accepted, vary, indigenous, peoples, retain, pre, colonial, norms, to, varying, degrees, people, in, western, cultures, may, practice, social, nudity, within, the, confines, of, semi, private, facilities, such, as, naturist, resorts, while, other, seek, more, open, acceptance, of, nudity, in, everyday, life, and, in, public, spaces, designated, as, clothing, optional, in, the, islamic, societies, of, africa, nudity, is, forbidden, while, in, sub, saharan, countries, that, never, abandoned, or, are, reasserting, pre, colonial, norms, partial, or, complete, nudity, is, accepted, as, natural, in, contemporary, rural, villages, both, boys, and, girls, are, allowed, to, play, totally, nude, and, women, bare, their, breasts, in, the, belief, that, the, meaning, of, naked, bodies, is, not, limited, to, sexuality, full, or, partial, nudity, is, observed, among, some, burkinabese, and, nilo, saharan, e, g, nuba, and, surma, people, during, particular, occasions, for, example, stick, fighting, tournaments, in, ethiopia, in, lagos, nigeria, some, parents, continue, to, allow, children, to, be, naked, until, puberty, there, is, now, an, issue, with, strangers, taking, photographs, and, they, worry, about, pedophiles, but, want, kids, to, grow, up, with, a, positive, body, image, and, have, the, same, freedom, they, remember, from, their, own, childhood, the, revival, of, pre, colonial, culture, is, asserted, in, the, adoption, of, traditional, dress, young, women, wearing, only, beaded, skirts, and, jewelry, in, the, umkhosi, womhlanga, reed, dance, by, the, zulu, and, swazi, other, examples, of, ethnic, tourism, reflect, the, visitor, s, desire, to, experience, what, they, imagine, being, an, exotic, culture, which, includes, nudity, in, asian, countries, rather, than, always, being, immoral, or, shameful, not, being, properly, dressed, is, perceived, as, a, breach, of, etiquette, loss, of, face, in, most, situations, while, nakedness, may, be, part, of, maintaining, purity, by, public, bathing, or, expressing, rejection, of, worldliness, including, clothes, in, contemporary, china, while, maintaining, the, traditions, of, modest, dress, in, everyday, life, the, use, of, nudity, in, magazine, advertising, indicates, the, effect, of, globalization, in, much, of, asia, traditional, dress, covers, the, entire, body, similar, to, western, dress, in, stories, written, in, china, as, early, as, the, fourth, century, bce, nudity, is, presented, as, an, affront, to, human, dignity, reflecting, the, belief, that, humanness, in, chinese, society, is, not, innate, but, is, earned, by, correct, behavior, however, nakedness, could, also, be, used, by, an, individual, to, express, contempt, for, others, in, their, presence, in, other, stories, the, nudity, of, women, emanating, the, power, of, yin, could, nullify, the, yang, of, aggressive, forces, in, india, the, conventions, regarding, proper, dress, do, not, apply, to, monks, in, some, hindu, and, jain, sects, who, reject, clothing, as, worldly, although, overwhelmingly, male, there, have, been, female, ascetics, such, as, akka, mahadevi, who, refused, to, wear, clothing, in, bangladesh, the, mru, people, have, resisted, centuries, of, muslim, and, christian, pressure, to, clothe, their, nakedness, as, part, of, religious, conversion, most, retain, their, own, religion, which, includes, elements, of, buddhism, and, animism, as, well, as, traditional, clothing, a, loincloth, for, men, and, a, skirt, for, women, the, tokugawa, period, in, japan, 1603, 1868, was, defined, by, the, social, dominance, of, hereditary, classes, with, clothing, a, regulated, marker, of, status, and, little, nudity, among, the, upper, classes, however, working, populations, in, both, rural, and, urban, areas, often, dressed, only, in, fundoshi, similar, to, a, loincloth, including, women, in, hot, weather, and, while, nursing, lacking, baths, in, their, homes, everyone, frequented, public, bathhouses, where, they, were, unclothed, together, this, communal, nudity, might, extend, to, other, activities, in, rural, villages, with, the, opening, of, japan, to, european, visitors, in, the, meiji, era, 1868, 1912, the, previously, normal, states, of, undress, and, the, custom, of, mixed, public, bathing, became, an, issue, for, leaders, concerned, with, japan, s, international, reputation, a, law, was, established, with, fines, for, those, that, violated, the, ban, on, undress, although, often, ignored, or, circumvented, the, law, had, the, effect, of, sexualizing, the, naked, body, in, situations, that, had, not, previously, been, erotic, public, bathing, for, purification, as, well, as, cleanliness, is, part, of, both, shintoism, and, buddhism, in, japan, purification, in, the, bath, is, not, only, for, the, body, but, the, heart, or, spirit, kokoro, public, baths, sent, were, once, common, but, became, less, so, with, the, addition, of, bathtubs, in, homes, sent, were, mixed, gender, konyoku, until, the, arrival, of, western, influences, but, became, segregated, by, gender, in, cities, nudity, is, required, at, japanese, hot, spring, resorts, onsen, some, resorts, continue, to, be, mixed, gender, but, the, number, is, declining, as, they, cease, to, be, supported, by, local, communities, in, korea, bathhouses, are, known, as, jjimjilbang, such, facilities, may, include, mixed, sex, sauna, areas, where, clothing, is, worn, but, bathing, areas, are, gender, segregated, nudity, is, required, in, those, areas, in, russia, communal, banyas, have, been, used, for, over, a, thousand, years, serving, both, hygienic, and, social, functions, nudity, and, mixed, sex, usage, was, typical, for, much, of, this, history, bathing, facilities, in, homes, threatened, the, existence, of, public, banyas, but, social, functions, maintained, their, popularity, prior, to, the, european, colonization, of, new, zealand, m, ori, people, went, naked, or, partially, clothed, in, casual, settings, as, the, climate, allowed, although, they, did, wear, clothing, to, keep, out, the, weather, and, denote, social, status, men, frequently, wore, nothing, but, a, belt, with, a, piece, of, string, attached, holding, their, foreskin, shut, over, their, glans, penis, there, was, no, shame, or, modesty, attached, to, women, s, breasts, and, therefore, no, garments, devoted, to, concealing, them, however, women, did, cover, their, pubic, area, in, the, presence, of, men, as, exposing, it, was, a, cultural, expression, of, anger, and, contempt, pre, pubescent, children, wore, no, clothes, at, all, european, colonists, cited, nudity, as, a, sign, of, m, ori, racial, inferiority, calling, them, naked, savages, on, the, islands, of, yap, state, dances, by, women, in, traditional, dress, that, does, not, cover, the, breasts, are, now, included, in, the, catholic, celebration, of, christmas, and, easter, in, brazil, the, yawalapiti, an, indigenous, xingu, tribe, in, the, amazon, basin, practice, a, funeral, ritual, known, as, quarup, to, celebrate, life, death, and, rebirth, the, ritual, involves, the, presentation, of, all, young, girls, who, have, begun, menstruating, since, the, last, quarup, and, whose, time, has, come, to, choose, a, partner, the, aw, hunters, the, male, members, of, an, indigenous, people, of, brazil, living, in, the, eastern, amazon, rainforest, are, completely, naked, except, for, a, piece, of, string, decorated, with, bright, bird, feathers, tied, to, the, end, of, their, penises, this, minimalist, dress, code, reflects, the, spirit, of, the, hunt, and, being, overdressed, may, be, considered, ridiculous, or, inappropriate, the, western, world, inherited, contradictory, cultural, traditions, relating, to, nudity, in, various, contexts, the, first, tradition, came, from, the, ancient, greeks, who, saw, the, naked, body, as, the, natural, state, and, as, essentially, positive, the, second, is, based, upon, the, abrahamic, religions, judaism, christianity, and, islam, which, view, being, naked, as, shameful, and, essentially, negative, the, interaction, between, the, greek, classical, and, later, abrahamic, traditions, has, resulted, in, western, ambivalence, with, nudity, acquiring, both, positive, and, negative, meanings, in, individual, psychology, in, social, life, and, in, depictions, such, as, art, the, conservative, versions, of, these, religions, continue, to, prohibit, public, and, sometimes, also, private, nudity, while, public, modesty, prevails, in, more, recent, times, organized, groups, of, nudists, or, naturists, emerged, with, the, stated, purpose, of, regaining, a, natural, connection, to, the, human, body, and, nature, sometimes, in, private, spaces, but, also, in, public, naturism, in, the, united, states, meanwhile, remains, largely, confined, to, private, facilities, with, few, clothing, optional, public, spaces, compared, to, europe, in, spite, of, the, liberalization, of, attitudes, toward, sex, americans, remain, uncomfortable, with, complete, nudity, the, moral, ambiguity, of, nudity, is, reflected, in, its, many, meanings, often, expressed, in, the, metaphors, used, to, describe, cultural, values, both, positive, and, negative, one, of, the, first, but, now, obsolete, meanings, of, nude, in, the, 16th, century, was, mere, plain, open, explicit, as, reflected, in, the, modern, metaphors, the, naked, truth, and, the, bare, facts, naturists, often, speak, of, their, nakedness, in, terms, of, a, return, to, the, innocence, and, simplicity, of, childhood, the, term, naturism, is, based, upon, the, idea, that, nakedness, is, connected, to, nature, positively, as, a, form, of, egalitarianism, that, all, humans, are, alike, in, their, nakedness, nudity, also, represents, freedom, the, liberation, of, the, body, is, associated, with, sexual, liberation, although, many, naturists, tend, to, downplay, this, connection, in, some, forms, of, group, psychotherapy, nudity, has, been, used, to, promote, open, interaction, and, communication, religious, persons, who, reject, the, world, as, it, is, including, all, possessions, may, practice, nudism, or, use, nakedness, as, a, protest, against, an, unjust, world, many, of, the, negative, associations, of, nakedness, are, the, inverse, of, positive, ones, if, nudity, is, truth, nakedness, may, be, an, invasion, of, privacy, or, the, exposure, of, uncomfortable, truths, a, source, of, anxiety, to, be, deprived, of, clothes, is, punishment, humiliating, and, degrading, rather, than, being, natural, nakedness, is, associated, with, sin, criminality, and, punishment, the, strong, connection, of, nudity, to, sex, produces, shame, when, naked, in, contexts, where, sexuality, is, deemed, inappropriate, the, connection, of, nakedness, with, the, corruptibility, of, flesh, and, death, may, have, biblical, origins, but, gained, real, world, associations, during, epidemics, in, the, middle, ages, confronted, with, this, ambiguity, some, individuals, seek, to, resolve, it, by, working, toward, greater, acceptance, of, nudity, for, themselves, and, others, although, psychologist, keon, west, found, positive, effects, from, short, term, participation, in, social, nudity, such, as, an, improved, body, image, sociologist, barbara, g, rnicka, found, that, lasting, change, is, a, gradual, process, of, social, learning, similar, to, other, forms, of, group, socialization, however, philosopher, krista, thomason, notes, that, negative, emotions, including, shame, exist, because, they, are, functional, and, that, human, beings, are, not, perfect, the, meaning, of, the, naked, body, in, judaism, christianity, and, islam, is, based, upon, the, genesis, creation, narrative, but, each, religion, has, their, own, interpretation, what, is, shared, by, all, was, various, degrees, of, modest, dress, and, the, avoidance, of, nakedness, the, meaning, of, the, creation, myth, is, inconsistent, with, a, philosophical, analysis, of, shame, as, an, emotion, of, reflective, self, assessment, which, is, understood, as, a, response, to, being, seen, by, others, a, social, context, that, did, not, exist, the, response, of, adam, and, eve, to, cover, their, bodies, indicates, that, upon, gaining, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, they, became, aware, of, nakedness, as, intrinsically, shameful, which, contradicts, their, intrinsic, goodness, before, the, fall, according, to, german, philosopher, thorsten, botz, bornstein, interpretations, of, genesis, have, placed, responsibility, for, the, fall, of, man, and, original, sin, on, eve, and, therefore, all, women, as, a, result, the, nudity, of, women, is, deemed, more, shameful, personally, and, corrupting, to, society, than, the, nakedness, of, men, the, meaning, of, nudity, for, early, christians, was, the, baptism, which, was, originally, by, full, immersion, and, without, clothes, in, a, basin, attached, to, every, cathedral, both, men, and, women, were, baptized, naked, deaconesses, performing, the, rite, for, women, to, maintain, modesty, until, the, fifth, century, ce, pagan, nudity, was, associated, with, sex, christian, nudity, with, grace, jesus, was, originally, depicted, nude, as, would, have, been, the, case, in, roman, crucifixions, but, the, christian, adoption, of, the, pagan, association, of, the, body, with, sex, prompted, the, clothing, of, christ, some, clerics, went, further, to, hatred, and, fear, of, the, body, insisting, that, monks, sleep, fully, dressed, christian, theology, rarely, addresses, nudity, but, rather, proper, dress, and, modesty, western, cultures, adopted, greek, heritage, only, with, regard, to, art, the, ideal, nude, real, naked, people, remained, shameful, and, become, human, only, when, they, cover, their, nakedness, in, one, of, a, series, of, lectures, entitled, theology, of, the, body, given, in, 1979, pope, john, paul, ii, said, that, the, innocent, nudity, of, being, before, the, fall, is, regained, only, between, loving, spouses, in, daily, life, christianity, requires, clothing, in, public, but, with, great, variation, between, and, within, societies, as, to, the, meaning, of, public, and, how, much, of, the, body, is, covered, finnish, lutherans, practice, mixed, nudity, in, private, saunas, used, by, families, and, close, knit, groups, while, maintaining, communal, nudity, men, and, women, are, now, often, separated, in, public, or, community, settings, certain, sects, of, christianity, through, history, have, included, nudity, into, worship, practices, but, these, have, been, deemed, heretical, there, have, been, christian, naturists, in, the, united, states, since, the, 1920s, but, as, a, social, and, recreational, practice, rather, than, part, of, an, organized, religion, islamic, countries, are, guided, by, rules, of, modesty, that, forbid, nudity, with, variations, between, five, schools, of, islamic, law, the, most, conservative, is, the, hanbali, school, in, saudi, arabia, and, qatar, where, the, niqab, the, garment, covering, the, whole, female, body, and, the, face, with, a, narrow, opening, for, the, eyes, is, widespread, hands, are, also, hidden, within, sleeves, as, much, as, possible, the, burqa, limited, mainly, to, afghanistan, also, has, a, mesh, screen, which, covers, the, eye, opening, different, rules, apply, to, men, women, and, children, and, depend, upon, the, gender, and, family, relationship, of, others, present, in, western, cultures, shame, can, result, from, not, living, up, to, the, ideals, of, society, with, regard, to, physical, appearance, historically, such, shame, has, affected, women, more, than, men, with, regard, to, their, naked, bodies, the, result, is, a, tendency, toward, self, criticism, by, women, while, men, are, less, concerned, by, the, evaluation, of, others, in, patriarchal, societies, which, include, much, of, the, world, norms, regarding, proper, attire, and, behavior, are, stricter, for, women, than, for, men, and, the, judgements, for, violation, of, these, norms, are, more, severe, in, much, of, the, world, the, modesty, of, women, is, a, matter, not, only, of, social, custom, but, of, the, legal, definition, of, indecent, exposure, in, the, united, states, the, exposure, of, female, nipples, is, a, criminal, offense, in, many, states, and, is, not, usually, allowed, in, public, individual, women, who, have, contested, indecency, laws, by, baring, their, breasts, in, public, assert, that, their, behavior, is, not, sexual, in, canada, the, law, was, changed, to, include, a, definition, of, a, sexual, context, in, order, for, behavior, to, be, indecent, the, topfreedom, movement, in, the, united, states, promotes, equal, rights, for, women, to, be, naked, above, the, waist, in, public, on, the, same, basis, that, would, apply, to, men, in, the, same, circumstances, the, illegality, of, topfreedom, is, viewed, as, institutionalization, of, negative, cultural, values, that, affect, women, s, body, image, the, legal, justifications, for, topfreedom, include, equal, protection, the, right, to, privacy, and, freedom, of, expression, the, law, in, new, york, state, was, challenged, in, 1986, by, nine, women, who, exposed, their, breasts, in, a, public, park, which, led, to, nine, years, of, litigation, culminating, with, an, opinion, by, the, court, of, appeals, that, overturned, the, convictions, on, the, basis, of, the, women, s, actions, not, being, lewd, rather, than, overturning, the, law, as, unconstitutional, on, the, basis, of, equal, protection, which, is, what, the, women, sought, while, the, decision, gave, women, more, freedom, to, be, topfree, e, g, while, sunbathing, it, did, not, give, them, equality, with, men, other, court, decisions, have, given, individuals, the, right, to, be, briefly, nude, in, public, as, a, form, of, expression, protected, by, the, first, amendment, but, not, on, a, continuing, basis, for, their, own, comfort, or, enjoyment, as, men, are, allowed, to, do, in, 2020, the, us, supreme, court, refused, to, hear, the, appeal, of, three, women, after, the, new, hampshire, supreme, court, found, that, the, state, law, does, not, discriminate, against, women, because, it, bans, nudity, which, has, traditionally, included, female, breasts, breastfeeding, in, public, may, be, forbidden, in, some, jurisdictions, unregulated, in, others, or, protected, as, a, legal, right, in, public, and, the, workplace, where, public, breastfeeding, is, unregulated, or, legal, mothers, may, be, reluctant, to, do, so, because, other, people, may, object, the, issue, of, breastfeeding, is, part, of, the, sexualization, of, the, breast, in, many, cultures, and, the, perception, of, threat, in, what, others, perceive, as, non, sexual, pope, francis, came, out, in, support, of, public, breastfeeding, at, church, services, soon, after, assuming, the, papacy, historically, men, and, boys, bathed, and, swam, nude, in, secluded, rivers, and, lakes, in, england, when, sea, bathing, became, popular, in, the, 18th, century, beaches, were, initially, male, only, but, with, the, easier, access, of, the, 19th, century, due, to, rail, transportation, the, mixing, of, genders, became, a, problem, for, authorities, the, addition, of, bathing, machines, at, seaside, resorts, was, not, successful, in, maintaining, standards, of, decency, men, often, continuing, to, be, nude, while, women, wore, bathing, costumes, however, public, concern, was, only, regarding, adults, it, being, generally, accepted, that, boys, at, english, beaches, would, be, nude, this, prompted, complaints, by, visiting, americans, but, englishmen, had, no, objection, to, their, daughters, being, fully, dressed, on, the, beach, with, naked, boys, in, the, united, states, and, other, western, countries, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, male, nudity, was, the, norm, in, gender, segregated, activities, including, summer, camps, swimming, pools, and, communal, showers, based, on, cultural, beliefs, that, females, need, more, privacy, than, males, beginning, in, 1900, businessmen, swam, nude, at, private, athletic, clubs, in, new, york, city, which, ended, with, a, 1980, law, requiring, the, admission, of, women, for, younger, boys, lack, of, modesty, might, include, public, behavior, as, in, 1909, when, the, new, york, times, reported, that, at, an, elementary, school, public, swimming, competition, the, youngest, boys, competed, in, the, nude, hygiene, was, given, as, the, reason, for, official, guidelines, requiring, nudity, in, indoor, pools, used, only, by, men, swimmers, were, also, required, to, take, nude, showers, with, soap, prior, to, entering, the, pool, in, order, to, eliminate, contaminants, and, inspect, swimmers, to, prohibit, use, by, those, with, signs, of, disease, during, women, s, weekly, swim, hours, simple, one, piece, suits, were, allowed, and, sometimes, supplied, by, the, facility, to, insure, hygiene, towels, were, also, supplied, compared, to, the, acceptance, of, boys, being, nude, an, instance, in, 1947, where, girls, were, given, the, same, option, lasted, only, six, weeks, in, highland, park, michigan, before, a, protest, by, mothers, however, only, the, middle, school, required, suits, the, elementary, schools, in, the, same, district, continued, to, allow, girls, to, swim, nude, the, public, health, recommendation, of, male, nudity, continued, officially, until, 1962, but, was, observed, into, the, 1970s, by, the, ymca, and, schools, with, gender, segregated, classes, the, era, of, male, nude, swimming, in, indoor, pools, declined, steadily, as, mixed, gender, usage, became, the, norm, and, sped, up, following, the, passage, of, title, ix, of, the, education, amendments, of, 1972, eventually, all, pools, use, became, mixed, gender, and, in, the, 21st, century, the, practice, of, male, nude, swimming, is, largely, forgotten, or, denied, as, having, ever, existed, social, acceptance, of, mixed, gender, nudity, due, to, sauna, culture, is, associated, with, greater, gender, equality, which, is, highest, in, iceland, norway, finland, and, sweden, the, us, being, 53, of, 153, countries, listed, america, and, the, netherlands, went, through, the, same, period, of, feminist, activism, in, the, 1960s, 70s, but, dutch, men, were, generally, more, open, to, the, idea, of, gender, equality, there, being, a, prior, history, of, regarding, sexuality, as, healthy, and, normal, including, nudity, not, always, being, sexual, a, report, issued, in, 2009, on, child, sexual, development, in, the, united, states, by, the, national, child, traumatic, stress, network, asserted, that, children, have, a, natural, curiosity, about, their, own, bodies, and, the, bodies, of, others, the, report, recommended, that, parents, learn, what, is, normal, in, regard, to, nudity, and, sexuality, at, each, stage, of, a, child, s, development, and, refrain, from, overreacting, to, their, children, s, nudity, related, behaviors, unless, there, are, signs, of, a, problem, e, g, anxiety, aggression, or, sexual, interactions, between, children, not, of, the, same, age, or, stage, of, development, problematic, childhood, behavior, often, takes, place, in, daycare, rather, than, home, environments, the, general, advice, for, caregivers, is, to, find, ways, of, setting, boundaries, without, giving, the, child, a, sense, of, shame, in, northern, european, countries, where, family, nudity, is, normal, children, learn, from, an, early, age, that, nakedness, need, not, be, sexual, bodily, modesty, is, not, part, of, the, finnish, identity, due, to, the, universal, use, of, the, sauna, a, historical, tradition, that, has, been, maintained, bonny, rough, who, raised, her, children, while, residing, in, the, united, states, and, the, netherlands, advises, us, parents, and, caregivers, to, understand, that, a, child, s, explorations, of, their, own, and, others, bodies, are, motivated, by, curiosity, not, anything, similar, to, adult, sexuality, a, 2009, report, issued, by, the, cdc, comparing, the, sexual, health, of, teens, in, france, germany, the, netherlands, and, the, united, states, concluded, that, if, the, us, implemented, comprehensive, sex, education, similar, to, the, three, european, countries, there, would, be, a, significant, reduction, in, teen, pregnancies, abortions, and, the, rate, of, sexually, transmitted, diseases, and, the, us, would, save, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, in, thinking, about, nudity, an, important, dimension, of, culture, is, private, public, and, the, behavior, that, is, normal, within, each, space, in, some, cultures, private, means, being, entirely, alone, defining, personal, space, in, other, cultures, privacy, includes, family, and, selected, others, intimate, space, being, in, public, includes, potentially, anyone, as, with, parks, sidewalks, and, roads, some, public, spaces, are, limited, to, paying, customers, as, with, caf, s, or, supermarkets, the, meaning, of, public, space, changed, as, cities, grew, between, private, and, public, there, may, be, other, distinctions, that, limit, access, such, as, age, sex, membership, which, define, social, spaces, each, with, expectations, of, shared, norms, being, followed, in, the, absence, of, visual, barriers, privacy, is, maintained, by, social, distance, as, when, being, examined, for, medical, purposes, or, receiving, a, massage, violation, of, boundaries, between, doctors, and, patients, is, a, serious, breach, of, medical, ethics, between, social, equals, privacy, is, maintained, by, civil, inattention, allowing, others, to, maintain, their, personal, space, by, only, glancing, not, looking, directly, as, in, a, crowded, elevator, civil, inattention, also, maintains, the, non, sexual, nature, of, semi, public, situations, in, which, relative, or, complete, nakedness, is, necessary, such, as, communal, bathing, or, changing, clothes, such, activities, are, regulated, by, participants, negotiating, behaviors, that, avoid, sexualization, a, particular, example, is, open, water, swimming, in, the, united, kingdom, which, by, necessity, means, changing, outdoors, in, mixed, gender, groups, with, minimal, or, no, privacy, as, a, participant, stated, open, water, swimming, and, nudity, go, hand, in, hand, people, don, t, necessarily, talk, about, it, but, just, know, if, you, join, a, swimming, club, it, s, likely, you, will, see, far, more, genitalia, than, you, were, perhaps, expecting, in, the, 21st, century, many, situations, have, become, sexualized, by, media, portrayals, of, any, nudity, as, a, prelude, to, sex, the, social, context, defines, the, cultural, meaning, of, nudity, that, may, range, from, the, sacred, to, the, profane, there, are, activities, where, freedom, of, movement, is, promoted, by, full, or, partial, nudity, the, nudity, of, the, ancient, olympics, was, part, of, a, religious, practice, athletic, activities, are, also, appreciated, for, the, beauty, of, bodies, in, motion, as, in, dance, but, in, the, post, modern, media, athletic, bodies, are, often, taken, out, of, context, to, become, purely, sexual, perhaps, pornographic, the, sexual, nature, of, nudity, is, defined, by, the, gaze, of, others, studies, of, naturism, find, that, its, practitioners, adopt, behaviors, and, norms, that, suppress, the, sexual, responses, while, practicing, social, nudity, such, norms, include, refraining, from, staring, touching, or, otherwise, calling, attention, to, the, body, while, naked, however, some, naturists, do, not, maintain, this, non, sexual, atmosphere, as, when, nudist, resorts, host, sexually, oriented, events, societies, in, continental, europe, think, of, privacy, as, protecting, a, right, to, respect, and, personal, dignity, europeans, maintain, their, dignity, even, naked, where, others, may, see, them, including, sunbathing, in, urban, parks, in, amsterdam, people, are, not, shy, about, being, naked, in, their, homes, and, do, not, use, shades, to, prevent, being, seen, from, outside, in, america, the, right, to, privacy, is, oriented, toward, values, of, liberty, especially, in, one, s, home, americans, see, nakedness, where, others, may, see, as, surrendering, any, reasonable, expectation, of, privacy, such, cultural, differences, may, make, some, laws, and, behaviors, of, other, societies, seem, incomprehensible, since, each, culture, assumes, that, their, own, concepts, of, privacy, are, intuitive, and, thus, human, universals, the, concepts, of, high, context, and, low, context, cultures, were, introduced, by, anthropologist, edward, t, hall, the, behaviors, and, norms, of, a, high, context, culture, depend, upon, shared, implicit, norms, that, operate, within, a, social, situation, while, in, a, low, context, culture, behavior, is, more, dependent, upon, explicit, communications, an, example, of, this, distinction, was, found, in, research, on, the, behavior, of, french, and, german, naturists, on, a, nude, beach, germans, who, are, extremely, low, in, cultural, context, maintain, public, propriety, on, a, nude, beach, by, not, wearing, adornments, avoiding, touching, themselves, and, others, and, any, other, behaviors, that, would, call, attention, to, the, body, by, contrast, the, french, in, their, personal, lives, are, relatively, high, context, they, interact, within, closely, knit, groups, they, are, sensitive, to, nonverbal, cues, and, they, engage, in, relatively, high, amounts, of, body, contact, french, naturists, were, more, likely, than, germans, to, wear, make, up, and, jewelry, and, to, touch, others, as, they, would, while, dressed, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, attitudes, of, the, general, public, toward, the, human, body, reflected, rising, consumerism, concerns, regarding, health, and, fitness, and, changes, in, clothing, fashions, that, sexualized, the, body, however, members, of, english, families, report, that, in, the, 1920s, to, 1940s, they, never, saw, other, family, members, undressed, including, those, of, the, same, gender, modesty, continued, to, prevail, between, married, couples, even, during, sex, in, the, united, states, a, third, of, women, born, before, 1900, remained, clothed, during, sex, while, it, was, only, eight, percent, for, those, born, in, the, 1920s, individuals, vary, in, their, comfort, with, being, nude, in, private, according, to, a, 2004, u, s, survey, by, abc, news, 31, percent, of, men, and, 14, percent, of, women, report, sleeping, in, the, nude, in, a, 2014, survey, in, the, u, k, 42, percent, responded, that, they, felt, comfortable, naked, and, 50, percent, responded, they, did, not, only, 22, percent, said, they, often, walk, around, the, house, naked, 29, percent, slept, in, the, nude, and, 27, percent, had, gone, swimming, nude, in, a, 2018, u, s, survey, by, usa, today, 58, percent, reported, that, they, slept, in, the, nude, by, generation, 65, percent, of, millennials, but, only, 39, percent, of, baby, boomers, body, image, is, the, perceptions, and, feelings, of, a, person, regarding, their, own, body, s, appearance, which, effects, self, esteem, and, life, satisfaction, there, is, evidence, that, the, majority, of, women, and, girls, in, western, societies, have, a, negative, body, image, mainly, regarding, their, size, and, weight, the, sociocultural, model, of, body, image, emphasizes, the, role, of, cultural, ideals, in, the, formation, of, an, individual, s, body, image, american, ideals, for, women, are, unrealistic, based, upon, a, comparison, of, a, healthy, body, mass, index, bmi, with, the, desired, bmi, which, is, 15, percent, lower, cultural, ideals, are, transmitted, by, parents, peers, and, the, media, men, and, boys, are, increasingly, concerned, with, their, appearance, wanting, to, be, more, muscular, in, non, western, cultures, body, image, has, a, different, meaning, particularly, in, sociocentric, societies, in, which, people, think, of, themselves, as, part, of, a, group, not, as, individuals, in, addition, where, food, insecurity, and, disease, is, a, danger, a, person, growing, thinner, is, viewed, as, unhealthy, a, more, robust, body, is, the, ideal, the, evolutionary, perspective, is, that, for, women, hip, to, waist, ratio, with, emphasis, on, the, hips, and, a, more, curvaceous, body, is, the, ideal, around, the, world, while, for, men, it, is, waist, to, chest, ratio, however, westernization, of, cultures, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, body, dissatisfaction, worldwide, shame, is, one, of, the, moral, emotions, often, associated, with, nudity, shame, may, be, thought, of, as, positive, in, response, to, a, failure, to, act, in, accordance, with, moral, values, thus, motivating, improvement, in, the, future, however, shame, is, often, negative, as, the, response, to, perceived, failures, to, live, up, to, unrealistic, expectations, the, shame, regarding, nudity, is, one, of, the, exemplars, of, the, emotion, yet, rather, than, being, a, positive, motivator, it, is, considered, unhealthy, the, universality, of, bodily, shame, is, not, supported, by, anthropological, studies, which, do, not, find, the, use, of, clothing, to, cover, the, genital, areas, in, all, societies, but, often, find, the, use, of, adornments, to, call, attention, to, the, sexuality, others, argue, that, the, shame, felt, when, naked, in, public, is, due, to, valuing, modesty, and, privacy, as, socially, positive, however, the, response, to, public, exposure, of, normally, private, behavior, is, embarrassment, rather, than, shame, the, absence, of, shame, or, any, other, negative, emotions, regarding, being, naked, depends, upon, becoming, unselfconscious, while, nude, which, is, the, state, both, of, children, and, those, that, practice, naturism, this, state, is, more, difficult, for, women, given, the, social, presumption, that, women, s, bodies, are, always, being, observed, and, judged, not, only, by, men, but, other, women, in, a, naturist, environment, because, everyone, is, naked, it, becomes, possible, to, dilute, the, power, of, social, judgements, naturists, have, long, promoted, the, benefits, of, social, nudity, but, little, research, had, been, done, reflecting, the, generally, negative, assumptions, surrounding, public, nudity, recent, studies, indicate, not, only, that, social, nudity, promotes, a, positive, body, image, but, that, nudity, based, interventions, are, helpful, for, those, with, a, negative, body, image, a, negative, body, image, affects, overall, self, esteem, which, in, turn, reduces, life, satisfaction, psychologist, keon, west, of, goldsmiths, university, of, london, found, that, nude, social, interaction, reduced, body, anxiety, and, promoted, well, being, historically, certain, facilities, associated, with, activities, that, require, partial, or, complete, nakedness, such, as, bathing, or, changing, clothes, have, limited, access, to, certain, members, of, the, public, these, normal, activities, are, guided, by, generally, accepted, norms, the, first, of, which, is, that, the, facilities, are, most, often, segregated, by, gender, however, this, may, not, be, the, case, in, all, cultures, discomfort, with, nudity, has, two, components, not, wanting, to, see, others, naked, and, not, wanting, to, be, seen, by, others, while, naked, in, islamic, countries, women, may, not, use, public, baths, and, men, must, wear, a, waist, wrapper, in, some, traditional, cultures, and, rural, areas, modern, practices, are, limited, by, the, belief, that, only, the, exposed, parts, of, the, body, hands, feet, face, need, to, be, washed, daily, and, also, by, christian, and, muslim, belief, that, the, naked, body, is, shameful, and, must, always, be, covered, many, cultures, have, a, tradition, going, back, to, prehistory, of, communal, use, of, hot, water, or, steam, sweat, baths, which, are, usually, nude, sometimes, with, mixed, genders, the, sauna, is, attended, nude, in, its, source, country, of, finland, where, many, families, have, one, in, their, home, and, is, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, finnish, identity, for, finns, going, to, a, sauna, is, a, ritual, with, cultural, meanings, regarding, cleanliness, connections, to, nature, and, connection, to, other, people, without, public, roles, or, sexuality, saunas, have, been, adopted, worldwide, first, in, scandinavian, and, german, speaking, countries, of, europe, with, the, trend, in, some, of, these, being, to, allow, both, genders, to, bathe, together, nude, for, example, the, friedrichsbad, in, baden, baden, has, designated, times, when, mixed, nude, bathing, is, permitted, the, german, sauna, culture, also, became, popular, in, neighbouring, countries, such, as, switzerland, belgium, the, netherlands, and, luxembourg, in, contrast, to, scandinavia, public, sauna, facilities, in, these, countries, while, nude, do, not, usually, segregate, genders, the, sauna, came, to, the, united, states, in, the, 19th, century, when, finns, settled, in, western, territories, building, family, saunas, on, their, farms, when, community, saunas, were, built, in, the, 20th, century, they, eventually, included, separate, steam, rooms, for, men, and, women, korean, spas, have, opened, in, the, united, states, also, gender, separated, in, areas, with, nudity, in, addition, to, the, health, benefits, a, woman, wrote, in, psychology, today, suggesting, the, social, benefits, for, women, and, girls, having, real, life, experience, of, seeing, the, variety, of, real, female, bodies, even, more, naked, than, at, a, beach, as, a, counterbalance, to, the, unrealistic, nudity, seen, in, popular, media, the, men, s, locker, room, which, in, western, cultures, had, been, a, setting, for, open, male, social, nudity, is, in, the, 21st, century, united, states, becoming, a, space, of, modesty, and, distancing, between, men, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, norm, in, locker, rooms, had, been, for, men, to, undress, completely, without, embarrassment, that, norm, has, changed, in, the, 21st, century, men, typically, wear, towels, or, other, garments, in, the, locker, room, most, of, the, time, and, avoid, any, interaction, with, others, while, naked, this, shift, is, the, result, of, changes, in, social, norms, regarding, masculinity, and, how, maleness, is, publicly, expressed, also, open, male, nudity, has, become, associated, with, homosexuality, in, facilities, such, as, the, ymca, that, cater, to, multiple, generations, the, young, are, uncomfortable, sharing, space, with, older, people, who, do, not, cover, up, the, behavior, in, women, s, locker, rooms, and, showers, also, indicates, a, generational, change, younger, women, covering, more, and, full, nudity, being, brief, and, rare, while, older, women, are, more, open, and, casual, in, the, 21st, century, some, high, end, new, york, city, gyms, were, redesigned, to, cater, to, millennials, who, want, to, shower, without, ever, being, seen, naked, the, trend, for, privacy, is, being, extended, to, public, schools, colleges, and, community, facilities, replacing, gang, showers, and, open, locker, rooms, with, individual, stalls, and, changing, rooms, the, change, also, addresses, issues, of, transgender, usage, and, family, use, when, one, parent, accompanies, children, of, differing, gender, distinct, from, the, nude, artworks, created, sessions, where, artists, work, from, live, models, are, a, social, situation, where, nudity, has, a, long, tradition, the, role, of, the, model, both, as, part, of, visual, art, education, and, in, the, creation, of, finished, works, has, evolved, since, antiquity, in, western, societies, and, worldwide, wherever, western, cultural, practices, in, the, visual, arts, have, been, adopted, at, modern, universities, art, schools, and, community, groups, art, model, is, a, job, one, requirement, of, which, is, to, pose, undraped, some, have, investigated, the, benefits, of, arts, education, including, drawing, nudes, from, life, as, an, opportunity, to, satisfy, youthful, curiosity, regarding, the, human, body, in, a, non, sexual, context, participants, in, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, embraced, nudity, as, part, of, their, daily, routine, and, to, emphasize, their, rejection, of, anything, artificial, in, the, mainstream, diana, vreeland, could, note, in, vogue, in, 1970, that, a, bikini, bottom, worn, alone, had, become, fashionable, for, young, women, on, beaches, from, saint, tropez, france, to, sardinia, italy, in, 1974, an, article, in,
