a, video, game, console, is, an, electronic, device, that, outputs, a, video, signal, or, image, to, display, a, video, game, that, can, be, played, with, a, game, controller, these, may, be, home, consoles, which, are, generally, placed, in, a, permanent, location, connected, to, a, television, or, other, display, devices, and, controlled, with, a, separate, game, controller, or, handheld, consoles, which, include, their, own, display, unit, and, controller, functions, built, into, the, unit, and, which, can, be, played, anywhere, hybrid, consoles, combine, elements, of, both, home, and, handheld, consoles, video, game, consoles, are, a, specialized, form, of, a, home, computer, geared, towards, video, game, playing, designed, with, affordability, and, accessibility, to, the, general, public, in, mind, but, lacking, in, raw, computing, power, and, customization, simplicity, is, achieved, in, part, through, the, use, of, game, cartridges, or, other, simplified, methods, of, distribution, easing, the, effort, of, launching, a, game, however, this, leads, to, ubiquitous, proprietary, formats, that, create, competition, for, market, share, more, recent, consoles, have, shown, further, confluence, with, home, computers, making, it, easy, for, developers, to, release, games, on, multiple, platforms, further, modern, consoles, can, serve, as, replacements, for, media, players, with, capabilities, to, play, films, and, music, from, optical, media, or, streaming, media, services, video, game, consoles, are, usually, sold, on, a, five, seven, year, cycle, called, a, generation, with, consoles, made, with, similar, technical, capabilities, or, made, around, the, same, time, period, grouped, into, one, generation, the, industry, has, developed, a, razor, and, blades, model, manufacturers, often, sell, consoles, at, low, prices, sometimes, at, a, loss, while, primarily, making, a, profit, from, the, licensing, fees, for, each, game, sold, planned, obsolescence, then, draws, consumers, into, buying, the, next, console, generation, while, numerous, manufacturers, have, come, and, gone, in, the, history, of, the, console, market, there, have, always, been, two, or, three, dominant, leaders, in, the, market, with, the, current, market, led, by, sony, with, their, playstation, brand, microsoft, with, their, xbox, brand, and, nintendo, currently, producing, the, switch, console, previous, console, developers, include, sega, atari, coleco, mattel, nec, snk, fujitsu, and, 3do, the, first, video, game, consoles, were, produced, in, the, early, 1970s, ralph, h, baer, devised, the, concept, of, playing, simple, spot, based, games, on, a, television, screen, in, 1966, which, later, became, the, basis, of, the, magnavox, odyssey, in, 1972, inspired, by, the, table, tennis, game, on, the, odyssey, nolan, bushnell, ted, dabney, and, allan, alcorn, at, atari, inc, developed, the, first, successful, arcade, game, pong, and, looked, to, develop, that, into, a, home, version, which, was, released, in, 1975, the, first, consoles, were, capable, of, playing, only, a, very, limited, number, of, games, built, into, the, hardware, programmable, consoles, using, swappable, rom, cartridges, were, introduced, with, the, fairchild, channel, f, in, 1976, though, popularized, with, the, atari, 2600, released, in, 1977, handheld, consoles, emerged, from, technology, improvements, in, handheld, electronic, games, as, these, shifted, from, mechanical, to, electronic, digital, logic, and, away, from, light, emitting, diode, led, indicators, to, liquid, crystal, displays, lcd, that, resembled, video, screens, more, closely, early, examples, include, the, microvision, in, 1979, and, game, watch, in, 1980, and, the, concept, was, fully, realized, by, the, game, boy, in, 1989, both, home, and, handheld, consoles, have, become, more, advanced, following, global, changes, in, technology, these, technological, shifts, include, improved, electronic, and, computer, chip, manufacturing, to, increase, computational, power, at, lower, costs, and, size, the, introduction, of, 3d, graphics, and, hardware, based, graphic, processors, for, real, time, rendering, digital, communications, such, as, the, internet, wireless, networking, and, bluetooth, and, larger, and, denser, media, formats, as, well, as, digital, distribution, following, the, same, type, of, moore, s, law, progression, home, consoles, are, grouped, into, generations, each, lasting, approximately, five, years, consoles, within, each, generation, share, similar, specifications, and, features, such, as, processor, word, size, while, no, one, grouping, of, consoles, by, generation, is, universally, accepted, one, breakdown, of, generations, showing, representative, consoles, of, each, is, shown, below, most, consoles, are, considered, programmable, consoles, and, have, the, means, for, the, player, to, switch, between, different, games, traditionally, this, has, been, done, by, switching, a, physical, game, cartridge, or, game, card, or, by, using, optical, media, it, is, now, common, to, download, games, through, digital, distribution, and, store, them, on, internal, or, external, digital, storage, devices, dedicated, consoles, were, very, popular, in, the, first, generation, until, they, were, gradually, replaced, by, second, generation, that, use, rom, cartridges, the, fourth, generation, gradually, merged, with, optical, media, it, is, now, common, to, download, games, through, digital, distribution, and, store, them, on, internal, or, external, digital, storage, devices, some, consoles, are, considered, dedicated, consoles, in, which, games, available, for, the, console, are, baked, onto, the, hardware, either, by, being, programmed, via, the, circuitry, or, set, in, the, read, only, flash, memory, of, the, console, thus, the, console, s, game, library, cannot, be, added, to, or, changed, directly, by, the, user, the, user, can, typically, switch, between, games, on, dedicated, consoles, using, hardware, switches, on, the, console, or, through, in, game, menus, dedicated, consoles, were, common, in, the, first, generation, of, home, consoles, such, as, the, magnavox, odyssey, and, the, home, console, version, of, pong, and, more, recently, have, been, used, for, retro, consoles, such, as, the, nes, classic, edition, and, sega, genesis, mini, home, video, game, consoles, are, meant, to, be, connected, to, a, television, or, other, type, of, monitor, with, power, supplied, through, an, outlet, this, requires, the, unit, to, be, used, in, a, fixed, location, typically, at, home, in, one, s, living, room, separate, game, controllers, connected, through, wired, or, wireless, connections, are, used, to, provide, input, to, the, game, early, examples, include, the, atari, 2600, the, nintendo, entertainment, system, and, the, sega, genesis, newer, examples, include, the, wii, u, the, playstation, 5, and, the, xbox, series, x, specific, types, of, home, consoles, include, handheld, game, consoles, are, devices, that, typically, include, a, built, in, screen, and, game, controller, in, their, case, and, contain, a, rechargeable, battery, or, battery, compartment, this, allows, the, unit, to, be, carried, around, and, played, anywhere, in, contrast, to, a, home, game, console, examples, include, the, game, boy, the, playstation, portable, and, the, nintendo, 3ds, hybrid, video, game, consoles, are, devices, that, can, be, used, either, as, a, handheld, or, as, a, home, console, they, have, either, a, wired, connection, or, docking, station, that, connects, the, console, unit, to, a, television, screen, and, fixed, power, source, and, the, potential, to, use, a, separate, controller, however, they, can, also, be, used, as, a, handheld, while, prior, handhelds, like, the, sega, nomad, and, playstation, portable, or, home, consoles, such, as, the, wii, u, have, had, these, features, some, consider, the, nintendo, switch, to, be, the, first, true, hybrid, console, a, microconsole, is, a, home, video, game, console, that, is, typically, powered, by, low, cost, computing, hardware, making, the, console, lower, priced, compared, to, other, home, consoles, on, the, market, the, majority, of, microconsoles, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, the, playstation, tv, and, onlive, game, system, are, android, based, digital, media, players, that, are, bundled, with, gamepads, and, marketed, as, gaming, devices, such, microconsoles, can, be, connected, to, the, television, to, play, video, games, downloaded, from, an, application, store, such, as, google, play, during, the, later, part, of, video, game, history, there, have, been, specialized, consoles, using, computing, components, to, offer, multiple, games, to, players, most, of, these, plug, directly, into, one, s, television, and, thus, are, often, called, plug, and, play, consoles, they, are, also, considered, dedicated, consoles, since, it, is, generally, impossible, to, access, the, computing, components, by, an, average, consumer, though, tech, savvy, consumers, often, have, found, ways, to, hack, the, console, to, install, additional, functionality, voiding, the, manufacturer, s, warranty, plug, and, play, consoles, usually, come, with, the, console, unit, itself, one, or, more, controllers, and, the, required, components, for, power, and, video, hookup, many, recent, plug, and, play, releases, have, been, for, distributing, a, number, of, retro, games, for, a, specific, console, platform, examples, of, these, include, the, atari, flashback, series, the, nes, classic, edition, sega, genesis, mini, and, also, handheld, retro, consoles, such, as, the, nintendo, game, watch, color, screen, series, early, console, hardware, was, designed, as, customized, printed, circuit, boards, pcb, s, selecting, existing, integrated, circuit, chips, that, performed, known, functions, or, programmable, chips, like, erasable, programmable, read, only, memory, eprom, chips, that, could, perform, certain, functions, persistent, computer, memory, was, expensive, so, dedicated, consoles, were, generally, limited, to, the, use, of, processor, registers, for, storage, of, the, state, of, a, game, thus, limiting, the, complexities, of, such, titles, pong, in, both, its, arcade, and, home, format, had, a, handful, of, logic, and, calculation, chips, that, used, the, current, input, of, the, players, paddles, and, resisters, storing, the, ball, s, position, to, update, the, game, s, state, and, send, it, to, the, display, device, even, with, more, advanced, integrated, circuits, ic, s, of, the, time, designers, were, limited, to, what, could, be, done, through, the, electrical, process, rather, than, through, programming, as, normally, associated, with, video, game, development, improvements, in, console, hardware, followed, with, improvements, in, microprocessor, technology, and, semiconductor, device, fabrication, manufacturing, processes, have, been, able, to, reduce, the, feature, size, on, chips, typically, measured, in, nanometers, allowing, more, transistors, and, other, components, to, fit, on, a, chip, and, at, the, same, time, increasing, the, circuit, speeds, and, the, potential, frequency, the, chip, can, run, at, as, well, as, reducing, thermal, dissipation, chips, were, able, to, be, made, on, larger, dies, further, increasing, the, number, of, features, and, effective, processing, power, random, access, memory, became, more, practical, with, the, higher, density, of, transistors, per, chip, but, to, address, the, correct, blocks, of, memory, processors, needed, to, be, updated, to, use, larger, word, sizes, and, allot, for, larger, bandwidth, in, chip, communications, all, these, improvements, did, increase, the, cost, of, manufacturing, but, at, a, rate, far, less, than, the, gains, in, overall, processing, power, which, helped, to, make, home, computers, and, consoles, inexpensive, for, the, consumer, all, related, to, moore, s, law, of, technological, improvements, for, the, consoles, of, the, 1980s, to, 1990s, these, improvements, were, evident, in, the, marketing, in, the, late, 1980s, to, 1990s, during, the, bit, wars, where, console, manufacturers, had, focused, on, their, console, s, processor, s, word, size, as, a, selling, point, consoles, since, the, 2000s, are, more, similar, to, personal, computers, building, in, memory, storage, features, and, networking, capabilities, to, avoid, the, limitations, of, the, past, the, confluence, with, personal, computers, eased, software, development, for, both, computer, and, console, games, allowing, developers, to, target, both, platforms, however, consoles, differ, from, computers, as, most, of, the, hardware, components, are, preselected, and, customized, between, the, console, manufacturer, and, hardware, component, provider, to, assure, a, consistent, performance, target, for, developers, whereas, personal, computer, motherboards, are, designed, with, the, needs, for, allowing, consumers, to, add, their, desired, selection, of, hardware, components, the, fixed, set, of, hardware, for, consoles, enables, console, manufacturers, to, optimize, the, size, and, design, of, the, motherboard, and, hardware, often, integrating, key, hardware, components, into, the, motherboard, circuitry, itself, often, multiple, components, such, as, the, central, processing, unit, and, graphics, processing, unit, can, be, combined, into, a, single, chip, otherwise, known, as, a, system, on, a, chip, soc, which, is, a, further, reduction, in, size, and, cost, in, addition, consoles, tend, to, focus, on, components, that, give, the, unit, high, game, performance, such, as, the, cpu, and, gpu, and, as, a, tradeoff, to, keep, their, prices, in, expected, ranges, use, less, memory, and, storage, space, compared, to, typical, personal, computers, in, comparison, to, the, early, years, of, the, industry, where, most, consoles, were, made, directly, by, the, company, selling, the, console, many, consoles, of, today, are, generally, constructed, through, a, value, chain, that, includes, component, suppliers, such, as, amd, and, nvidia, for, cpu, and, gpu, functions, and, contract, manufacturers, including, electronics, manufacturing, services, factories, which, assemble, those, components, into, the, final, consoles, such, as, foxconn, and, flextronics, completed, consoles, are, then, usually, tested, distributed, and, repaired, by, the, company, itself, microsoft, and, nintendo, both, use, this, approach, to, their, consoles, while, sony, maintains, all, production, in, house, with, the, exception, of, their, component, suppliers, some, of, the, commons, elements, that, can, be, found, within, console, hardware, include, all, game, consoles, require, player, input, through, a, game, controller, to, provide, a, method, to, move, the, player, character, in, a, specific, direction, and, a, variation, of, buttons, to, perform, other, in, game, actions, such, as, jumping, or, interacting, with, the, game, world, though, controllers, have, become, more, featured, over, the, years, they, still, provide, less, control, over, a, game, compared, to, personal, computers, or, mobile, gaming, the, type, of, controller, available, to, a, game, can, fundamentally, change, the, style, of, how, a, console, game, will, or, can, be, played, however, this, has, also, inspired, changes, in, game, design, to, create, games, that, accommodate, for, the, comparatively, limited, controls, available, on, consoles, controllers, have, come, in, a, variety, of, styles, over, the, history, of, consoles, some, common, types, include, numerous, other, controller, types, exist, including, those, that, support, motion, controls, touchscreen, support, on, handhelds, and, some, consoles, and, specialized, controllers, for, specific, types, of, games, such, as, racing, wheels, for, racing, games, light, guns, for, shooting, games, and, musical, instrument, controllers, for, rhythm, games, some, newer, consoles, also, include, optional, support, for, a, mouse, and, keyboard, devices, some, older, consoles, such, as, 1988, sega, genesis, aka, mega, drive, and, 1993, 3do, interactive, multiplayer, supported, optional, mice, both, with, special, mice, made, for, them, but, the, 3do, mouse, like, that, console, was, a, flop, and, the, mouse, for, the, sega, had, very, limited, game, support, the, sega, also, supported, the, optional, menacer, a, wireless, infrared, light, gun, and, such, were, at, one, point, popular, for, games, it, also, support, batterup, a, baseball, bat, shaped, controller, a, controller, may, be, attached, through, a, wired, connection, onto, the, console, itself, or, in, some, unique, cases, like, the, famicom, hardwired, to, the, console, or, with, a, wireless, connection, controllers, require, power, either, provided, by, the, console, via, the, wired, connection, or, from, batteries, or, a, rechargeable, battery, pack, for, wireless, connections, controllers, are, nominally, built, into, a, handheld, unit, though, some, newer, ones, allow, for, separate, wireless, controllers, to, also, be, used, while, the, first, game, consoles, were, dedicated, game, systems, with, the, games, programmed, into, the, console, s, hardware, the, fairchild, channel, f, introduced, the, ability, to, store, games, in, a, form, separate, from, the, console, s, internal, circuitry, thus, allowing, the, consumer, to, purchase, new, games, to, play, on, the, system, since, the, channel, f, nearly, all, game, consoles, have, featured, the, ability, to, purchase, and, swap, games, through, some, form, through, those, forms, have, changes, with, improvements, in, technology, while, magnetic, storage, such, as, tape, drives, and, floppy, disks, had, been, popular, for, software, distribution, with, early, personal, computers, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, this, format, did, not, see, much, use, in, console, system, there, were, some, attempts, such, as, the, bally, astrocade, and, apf, m1000, using, tape, drives, as, well, as, the, disk, system, for, the, nintendo, famicom, and, the, nintendo, 64dd, for, the, nintendo, 64, but, these, had, limited, applications, as, magnetic, media, was, more, fragile, and, volatile, than, game, cartridges, in, addition, to, built, in, internal, storage, newer, consoles, often, give, the, consumer, the, ability, to, use, external, storage, media, to, save, game, date, downloaded, games, or, other, media, files, from, the, console, early, iterations, of, external, storage, were, achieved, through, the, use, of, flash, based, memory, cards, first, used, by, the, neo, geo, but, popularized, with, the, playstation, nintendo, continues, to, support, this, approach, with, extending, the, storage, capabilities, of, the, 3ds, and, switch, standardizing, on, the, current, sd, card, format, as, consoles, began, incorporating, the, use, of, usb, ports, support, for, usb, external, hard, drives, was, also, added, such, as, with, the, xbox, 360, with, internet, enabled, consoles, console, manufacturers, offer, both, free, and, paid, subscription, services, that, provide, value, added, services, atop, the, basic, functions, of, the, console, free, services, generally, offer, user, identity, services, and, access, to, a, digital, storefront, while, paid, services, allow, players, to, play, online, games, interact, with, other, uses, through, social, networking, use, cloud, saves, for, supported, games, and, gain, access, to, free, titles, on, a, rotating, basis, examples, of, such, services, include, the, xbox, network, playstation, network, and, nintendo, switch, online, certain, consoles, saw, various, add, ons, or, accessories, that, were, designed, to, attach, to, the, existing, console, to, extend, its, functionality, the, best, example, of, this, was, through, the, various, cd, rom, add, ons, for, consoles, of, the, fourth, generation, such, as, the, turbografx, cd, atari, jaguar, cd, and, the, sega, cd, other, examples, of, add, ons, include, the, 32x, for, the, sega, genesis, intended, to, allow, owners, of, the, aging, console, to, play, newer, games, but, has, several, technical, faults, and, the, game, boy, player, for, the, gamecube, to, allow, it, to, play, game, boy, games, consumers, can, often, purchase, a, range, of, accessories, for, consoles, outside, of, the, above, categories, these, can, include, console, or, game, development, kits, are, specialized, hardware, units, that, typically, include, the, same, components, as, the, console, and, additional, chips, and, components, to, allow, the, unit, to, be, connected, to, a, computer, or, other, monitoring, device, for, debugging, purposes, a, console, manufacturer, will, make, the, console, s, dev, kit, available, to, registered, developers, months, ahead, of, the, console, s, planned, launch, to, give, developers, time, to, prepare, their, games, for, the, new, system, these, initial, kits, will, usually, be, offered, under, special, confidentiality, clauses, to, protect, trade, secrets, of, the, console, s, design, and, will, be, sold, at, a, high, cost, to, the, developer, as, part, of, keeping, this, confidentiality, newer, consoles, that, share, features, in, common, with, personal, computers, may, no, longer, use, specialized, dev, kits, though, developers, are, still, expected, to, register, and, purchase, access, to, software, development, kits, from, the, manufacturer, for, example, any, consumer, xbox, one, can, be, used, for, game, development, after, paying, a, fee, to, microsoft, to, register, one, intent, to, do, so, since, the, release, of, the, nintendo, famicom, nintendo, entertainment, system, most, video, game, console, manufacturers, employ, a, strict, licensing, scheme, that, limit, what, games, can, be, developed, for, it, developers, and, their, publishers, must, pay, a, fee, typically, based, on, royalty, per, unit, sold, back, to, the, manufacturer, the, cost, varies, by, manufacturer, but, was, estimated, to, be, about, us, 3, 10, per, unit, in, 2012, with, additional, fees, such, as, branding, rights, this, has, generally, worked, out, to, be, an, industry, wide, 30, royalty, rate, paid, to, the, console, manufacturer, for, every, game, sold, this, is, in, addition, to, the, cost, of, acquiring, the, dev, kit, to, develop, for, the, system, the, licensing, fee, may, be, collected, in, a, few, different, ways, in, the, case, of, nintendo, the, company, generally, has, controlled, the, production, of, game, cartridges, with, its, lockout, chips, and, optical, media, for, its, systems, and, thus, charges, the, developer, or, publisher, for, each, copy, it, makes, as, an, upfront, fee, this, also, allows, nintendo, to, review, the, game, s, content, prior, to, release, and, veto, games, it, does, not, believe, appropriate, to, include, on, its, system, this, had, led, to, over, 700, unlicensed, games, for, the, nes, and, numerous, others, on, other, nintendo, cartridge, based, systems, that, had, found, ways, to, bypass, the, hardware, lockout, chips, and, sell, without, paying, any, royalties, to, nintendo, such, as, by, atari, in, its, subsidiary, company, tengen, this, licensing, approach, was, similarly, used, by, most, other, cartridge, based, console, manufacturers, using, lockout, chip, technology, with, optical, media, where, the, console, manufacturer, may, not, have, direct, control, on, the, production, of, the, media, the, developer, or, publisher, typically, must, establish, a, licensing, agreement, to, gain, access, to, the, console, s, proprietary, storage, format, for, the, media, as, well, as, to, use, the, console, and, manufacturer, s, logos, and, branding, for, the, game, s, packaging, paid, back, through, royalties, on, sales, in, the, transition, to, digital, distribution, where, now, the, console, manufacturer, runs, digital, storefronts, for, games, license, fees, apply, to, registering, a, game, for, distribution, on, the, storefront, again, gaining, access, to, the, console, s, branding, and, logo, with, the, manufacturer, taking, its, cut, of, each, sale, as, its, royalty, in, both, cases, this, still, gives, console, manufacturers, the, ability, to, review, and, reject, games, it, believes, unsuitable, for, the, system, and, deny, licensing, rights, with, the, rise, of, indie, game, development, the, major, console, manufacturers, have, all, developed, entry, level, routes, for, these, smaller, developers, to, be, able, to, publish, onto, consoles, at, far, lower, costs, and, reduced, royalty, rates, programs, like, microsoft, s, id, xbox, give, developers, most, of, the, needed, tools, for, free, after, validating, the, small, development, size, and, needs, of, the, team, similar, licensing, concepts, apply, for, third, party, accessory, manufacturers, consoles, like, most, consumer, electronic, devices, have, limited, lifespans, there, is, great, interest, in, preservation, of, older, console, hardware, for, archival, and, historical, purposes, as, games, from, older, consoles, as, well, as, arcade, and, personal, computers, remain, of, interest, computer, programmers, and, hackers, have, developed, emulators, that, can, be, run, on, personal, computers, or, other, consoles, that, simulate, the, hardware, of, older, consoles, that, allow, games, from, that, console, to, be, run, the, development, of, software, emulators, of, console, hardware, is, established, to, be, legal, but, there, are, unanswered, legal, questions, surrounding, copyrights, including, acquiring, a, console, s, firmware, and, copies, of, a, game, s, rom, image, which, laws, such, as, the, united, states, digital, millennium, copyright, act, make, illegal, save, for, certain, archival, purposes, even, though, emulation, itself, is, legal, nintendo, is, recognized, to, be, highly, protective, of, any, attempts, to, emulate, its, systems, and, has, taken, early, legal, actions, to, shut, down, such, projects, to, help, support, older, games, and, console, transitions, manufacturers, started, to, support, backward, compatibility, on, consoles, in, the, same, family, sony, was, the, first, to, do, this, on, a, home, console, with, the, playstation, 2, which, was, able, to, play, original, playstation, content, and, subsequently, became, a, sought, after, feature, across, many, consoles, that, followed, backward, compatibility, functionality, has, included, direct, support, for, previous, console, games, on, the, newer, consoles, such, as, within, the, xbox, console, family, the, distribution, of, emulated, games, such, as, nintendo, s, virtual, console, or, using, cloud, gaming, services, for, these, older, games, as, with, the, playstation, now, service, consoles, may, be, shipped, in, a, variety, of, configurations, but, typically, will, include, one, base, configuration, that, include, the, console, one, controller, and, sometimes, a, pack, in, game, manufacturers, may, offer, alternate, stock, keeping, unit, skus, options, that, include, additional, controllers, and, accessories, or, different, pack, in, games, special, console, editions, may, feature, unique, cases, or, faceplates, with, art, dedicated, to, a, specific, video, game, or, series, and, are, bundled, with, that, game, as, a, special, incentive, for, its, fans, pack, in, games, are, typically, first, party, games, often, featuring, the, console, s, primary, mascot, characters, the, more, recent, console, generations, have, also, seen, multiple, versions, of, the, same, base, console, system, either, offered, at, launch, or, presented, as, a, mid, generation, refresh, in, some, cases, these, simply, replace, some, parts, of, the, hardware, with, cheaper, or, more, efficient, parts, or, otherwise, streamline, the, console, s, design, for, production, going, forward, the, playstation, 3, underwent, several, such, hardware, refreshes, during, its, lifetime, due, to, technological, improvements, such, as, significant, reduction, of, the, process, node, size, for, the, cpu, and, gpu, in, these, cases, the, hardware, revision, model, will, be, marked, on, packaging, so, that, consumers, can, verify, which, version, they, are, acquiring, in, other, cases, the, hardware, changes, create, multiple, lines, within, the, same, console, family, the, base, console, unit, in, all, revisions, share, fundamental, hardware, but, options, like, internal, storage, space, and, ram, size, may, be, different, those, systems, with, more, storage, and, ram, would, be, marked, as, a, higher, performance, variant, available, at, a, higher, cost, while, the, original, unit, would, remain, as, a, budget, option, for, example, within, the, xbox, one, family, microsoft, released, the, mid, generation, xbox, one, x, as, a, higher, performance, console, the, xbox, one, s, as, the, lower, cost, base, console, and, a, special, xbox, one, s, all, digital, edition, revision, that, removed, the, optical, drive, on, the, basis, that, users, could, download, all, games, digitally, offered, at, even, a, lower, cost, than, the, xbox, one, s, in, these, cases, developers, can, often, optimize, games, to, work, better, on, the, higher, performance, console, with, patches, to, the, retail, version, of, the, game, in, the, case, of, the, nintendo, 3ds, the, new, nintendo, 3ds, featured, upgraded, memory, and, processors, with, new, games, that, could, only, be, run, on, the, upgraded, units, and, cannot, be, run, on, an, older, base, unit, there, have, also, been, a, number, of, slimmed, down, console, options, with, significantly, reduced, hardware, components, that, significantly, reduced, the, price, they, could, sell, the, console, to, the, consumer, but, either, leaving, certain, features, off, the, console, such, as, the, wii, mini, that, lacked, any, online, components, compared, to, the, wii, or, that, required, the, consumer, to, purchase, additional, accessories, and, wiring, if, they, did, not, already, own, it, such, as, the, new, style, nes, that, was, not, bundled, with, the, required, rf, hardware, to, connect, to, a, television, consoles, when, originally, launched, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, were, about, us, 200, 300, and, with, the, introduction, of, the, rom, cartridge, each, game, averaged, about, us, 30, 40, over, time, the, launch, price, of, base, consoles, units, has, generally, risen, to, about, us, 400, 500, with, the, average, game, costing, us, 60, exceptionally, the, period, of, transition, from, rom, cartridges, to, optical, media, in, the, early, 1990s, saw, several, consoles, with, high, price, points, exceeding, us, 400, and, going, as, high, as, us, 700, resultingly, sales, of, these, first, optical, media, consoles, were, generally, poor, when, adjusted, for, inflation, the, price, of, consoles, has, generally, followed, a, downward, trend, from, us, 800, 1, 000, from, the, early, generations, down, to, us, 500, 600, for, current, consoles, this, is, typical, for, any, computer, technology, with, the, improvements, in, computing, performance, and, capabilities, outpacing, the, additional, costs, to, achieve, those, gains, further, within, the, united, states, the, price, of, consoles, has, generally, remained, consistent, being, within, 0, 8, to, 1, of, the, median, household, income, based, on, the, united, states, census, data, for, the, console, s, launch, year, since, the, nintendo, entertainment, system, console, pricing, has, stabilized, on, the, razorblade, model, where, the, consoles, are, sold, at, little, to, no, profit, for, the, manufacturer, but, they, gain, revenue, from, each, game, sold, due, to, console, licensing, fees, and, other, value, added, services, around, the, console, such, as, xbox, live, console, manufacturers, have, even, been, known, to, take, losses, on, the, sale, of, consoles, at, the, start, of, a, console, s, launch, with, expectation, to, recover, with, revenue, sharing, and, later, price, recovery, on, the, console, as, they, switch, to, less, expensive, components, and, manufacturing, processes, without, changing, the, retail, price, consoles, have, been, generally, designed, to, have, a, five, year, product, lifetime, though, manufacturers, have, considered, their, entries, in, the, more, recent, generations, to, have, longer, lifetimes, of, seven, to, potentially, ten, years, the, competition, within, the, video, game, console, market, as, subset, of, the, video, game, industry, is, an, area, of, interest, to, economics, with, its, relatively, modern, history, its, rapid, growth, to, rival, that, of, the, film, industry, and, frequent, changes, compared, to, other, sectors, effects, of, unregulated, competition, on, the, market, were, twice, seen, early, in, the, industry, the, industry, had, its, first, crash, in, 1977, following, the, release, of, the, magnavox, odyssey, atari, s, home, versions, of, pong, and, the, coleco, telstar, which, led, other, third, party, manufacturers, using, inexpensive, general, instruments, processor, chips, to, make, their, own, home, consoles, which, flooded, the, market, by, 1977, 81, 89, the, video, game, crash, of, 1983, was, fueled, by, multiple, factors, including, competition, from, lower, cost, personal, computers, but, unregulated, competition, was, also, a, factor, as, numerous, third, party, game, developers, attempting, to, follow, on, the, success, of, activision, in, developing, third, party, games, for, the, atari, 2600, and, intellivision, flooded, the, market, with, poor, quality, games, and, made, it, difficult, for, even, quality, games, to, sell, nintendo, implemented, a, lockout, chip, the, checking, integrated, circuit, on, releasing, the, nintendo, entertainment, system, in, western, territories, as, a, means, to, control, which, games, were, published, for, the, console, as, part, of, their, licensing, agreements, nintendo, further, prevented, developers, from, releasing, the, same, game, on, a, different, console, for, a, period, of, two, years, this, served, as, one, of, the, first, means, of, securing, console, exclusivity, for, games, that, existed, beyond, technical, limitation, of, console, development, the, nintendo, entertainment, system, also, brought, the, concept, of, a, video, game, mascot, as, the, representation, of, a, console, system, as, a, means, to, sell, and, promote, the, unit, and, for, the, nes, was, mario, the, use, of, mascots, in, businesses, had, been, a, tradition, in, japan, and, this, had, already, proven, successful, in, arcade, games, like, pac, man, mario, was, used, to, serve, as, an, identity, for, the, nes, as, a, humor, filled, playful, console, mario, caught, on, quickly, when, the, nes, released, in, the, west, and, when, the, next, generation, of, consoles, arrived, other, manufacturers, pushed, their, own, mascots, to, the, forefront, of, their, marketing, most, notably, sega, with, the, use, of, sonic, the, hedgehog, the, nintendo, and, sega, rivalry, that, involved, their, mascot, s, flagship, games, served, as, part, of, the, fourth, console, generation, s, console, wars, since, then, manufacturers, have, typically, positioned, their, mascot, and, other, first, party, games, as, key, titles, in, console, bundles, used, to, drive, sales, of, consoles, at, launch, or, at, key, sales, periods, such, as, near, christmas, another, type, of, competitive, edge, used, by, console, manufacturers, around, the, same, time, was, the, notion, of, bits, or, the, size, of, the, word, used, by, the, main, cpu, the, turbografx, 16, was, the, first, console, to, push, on, its, bit, size, advertising, itself, as, a, 16, bit, console, though, this, only, referred, to, part, of, its, architecture, while, its, cpu, was, still, an, 8, bit, unit, despite, this, manufacturers, found, consumers, became, fixated, on, the, notion, of, bits, as, a, console, selling, point, and, over, the, fourth, fifth, and, sixth, generation, these, bit, wars, played, heavily, into, console, advertising, the, use, of, bits, waned, as, cpu, architectures, no, longer, needed, to, increase, their, word, size, and, instead, had, other, means, to, improve, performance, such, as, through, multicore, cpus, generally, increased, console, numbers, gives, rise, to, more, consumer, options, and, better, competition, but, the, exclusivity, of, titles, made, the, choice, of, console, for, consumers, an, all, or, nothing, decision, for, most, further, with, the, number, of, available, consoles, growing, with, the, fifth, and, sixth, generations, game, developers, became, pressured, to, which, systems, to, focus, on, and, ultimately, narrowed, their, target, choice, of, platforms, to, those, that, were, the, best, selling, this, cased, a, contraction, in, the, market, with, major, players, like, sega, leaving, the, hardware, business, after, the, dreamcast, but, continuing, in, the, software, area, effectively, each, console, generation, was, shown, to, have, two, or, three, dominant, players, competition, in, the, console, market, in, the, 2010s, and, 2020s, is, considered, an, oligarchy, between, three, main, manufacturers, nintendo, sony, and, microsoft, the, three, use, a, combination, of, first, party, games, exclusive, to, their, console, and, negotiate, exclusive, agreements, with, third, party, developers, to, have, their, games, be, exclusive, for, at, least, an, initial, period, of, time, to, drive, consumers, to, their, console, they, also, worked, with, cpu, and, gpu, manufacturers, to, tune, and, customize, hardware, for, computers, to, make, it, more, amenable, and, effective, for, video, games, leading, to, lower, cost, hardware, needed, for, video, game, consoles, finally, console, manufacturers, also, work, with, retailers, to, help, with, promotion, of, consoles, games, and, accessories, while, there, is, little, difference, in, pricing, on, the, console, hardware, from, the, manufacturer, s, suggested, retail, price, for, the, retailer, to, profit, from, these, details, with, the, manufacturers, can, secure, better, profits, on, sales, of, game, and, accessory, bundles, for, premier, product, placement, these, all, form, network, effects, with, each, manufacturer, seeking, to, maximize, the, size, of, their, network, of, partners, to, increase, their, overall, position, in, the, competition, of, the, three, microsoft, and, sony, both, with, their, own, hardware, manufacturing, capabilities, remain, at, a, leading, edge, approach, attempting, to, gain, a, first, mover, advantage, over, the, other, with, adaption, of, new, console, technology, nintendo, is, more, reliant, on, its, suppliers, and, thus, instead, of, trying, to, compete, feature, for, feature, with, microsoft, and, sony, had, instead, taken, a, blue, ocean, strategy, since, the, nintendo, ds, and, wii
