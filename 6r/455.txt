rock, climbing, is, a, sport, in, which, participants, climb, up, across, or, down, natural, rock, formations, or, indoor, climbing, walls, the, goal, is, to, reach, the, summit, of, a, formation, or, the, endpoint, of, a, usually, pre, defined, route, without, falling, rock, climbing, is, a, physically, and, mentally, demanding, sport, one, that, often, tests, a, climber, s, strength, endurance, agility, and, balance, along, with, mental, control, knowledge, of, proper, climbing, techniques, and, the, use, of, specialized, climbing, equipment, is, crucial, for, the, safe, completion, of, routes, because, of, the, wide, range, and, variety, of, rock, formations, around, the, world, rock, climbing, has, been, separated, into, several, different, styles, and, sub, disciplines, such, as, scrambling, bouldering, sport, climbing, and, trad, traditional, climbing, rock, climbing, competitions, have, the, objectives, of, either, completing, the, route, in, the, least, amount, of, attempts, the, least, amount, of, time, or, attaining, the, farthest, point, on, an, increasingly, difficult, route, indoor, rock, climbing, is, typically, split, into, three, disciplines, bouldering, lead, climbing, and, top, roping, the, sport, of, rock, climbing, covers, a, wide, range, of, activities, depending, on, the, style, of, climbing, used, and, the, type, of, climbing, being, undertaken, the, style, and, type, of, climbing, will, be, dictated, by, the, climber, s, skill, level, and, risk, appetite, and, also, by, the, specific, nature, of, the, climbing, route, that, is, being, attempted, a, fundamental, distinction, in, rock, climbing, is, whether, the, climber, used, artificial, aid, to, help, them, ascend, the, route, which, is, called, aid, climbing, where, they, used, no, aid, it, is, called, free, climbing, devices, used, only, for, climbing, protection, are, not, considered, aid, climbers, who, ascend, a, new, route, using, aid, have, made, a, first, ascent, fa, whereas, climbers, who, do, it, without, aid, have, made, the, more, coveted, first, free, ascent, ffa, a, free, climb, by, a, climber, who, had, never, seen, the, route, before, and, had, never, been, told, about, its, challenges, called, the, beta, and, completes, their, ascent, on, the, first, attempt, it, is, called, an, onsight, where, they, had, never, seen, it, but, had, been, given, beta, on, it, it, is, called, a, flash, a, free, climb, where, the, climber, had, to, attempt, the, route, many, times, before, ascending, is, called, a, redpoint, and, most, major, new, ffas, are, redpoints, most, of, the, climbing, done, in, modern, times, is, considered, free, climbing, climbing, using, one, s, own, physical, strength, with, equipment, used, solely, as, protection, and, not, as, support, as, opposed, to, aid, climbing, the, gear, dependent, form, of, climbing, that, was, dominant, in, the, sport, s, earlier, days, free, climbing, is, typically, divided, into, several, styles, that, differ, from, one, another, depending, on, the, choice, of, equipment, used, and, the, configurations, of, their, belay, rope, and, anchor, systems, as, routes, get, higher, off, the, ground, the, increased, risk, of, life, threatening, injuries, necessitates, additional, safety, measures, a, variety, of, specialized, climbing, techniques, and, climbing, equipment, exists, to, provide, that, safety, climbers, will, usually, work, in, pairs, and, utilize, a, system, of, ropes, and, anchors, designed, to, catch, falls, ropes, and, anchors, can, be, configured, in, different, ways, to, suit, many, styles, of, climbing, and, roped, climbing, are, thus, divided, into, further, sub, types, that, vary, based, on, how, their, belay, systems, are, set, up, generally, speaking, beginners, will, start, with, top, roping, and, or, easy, bouldering, and, work, their, way, up, to, lead, climbing, and, beyond, due, to, the, length, of, time, and, extended, endurance, required, and, because, accidents, are, most, likely, to, happen, on, the, descent, rock, climbers, do, not, usually, climb, back, down, the, route, or, downclimb, especially, on, the, larger, multiple, pitch, class, iii, iv, or, multi, day, grade, iv, vi, climbs, still, the, most, popular, method, of, climbing, big, walls, aid, climbers, make, progress, up, a, wall, by, repeatedly, placing, and, weighting, gear, that, is, used, directly, to, aid, ascent, and, enhance, safety, this, form, of, climbing, is, typically, used, when, ascent, is, too, technically, difficult, or, impossible, for, free, climbing, the, most, commonly, used, method, to, ascend, climbs, free, climbing, refers, to, climbs, where, the, climber, s, own, physical, strength, and, skill, are, relied, upon, to, accomplish, the, climb, free, climbing, may, rely, on, top, rope, belay, systems, or, on, lead, climbing, to, establish, protection, and, the, belay, stations, anchors, ropes, and, protection, are, used, to, back, up, the, climber, and, are, passive, as, opposed, to, active, ascending, aids, sub, types, of, free, climbing, are, trad, climbing, and, sport, climbing, free, climbing, is, generally, done, as, clean, lead, meaning, no, pitons, or, pins, are, used, as, protection, climbing, on, short, low, routes, without, the, use, of, the, safety, rope, that, is, typical, of, most, other, styles, protection, if, used, at, all, typically, consists, of, a, cushioned, bouldering, pad, below, the, route, and, a, spotter, a, person, who, watches, from, below, and, directs, the, fall, of, the, climber, away, from, hazardous, areas, bouldering, may, be, an, arena, for, intense, and, relatively, safe, competition, resulting, in, exceptionally, high, difficulty, standards, solo, climbing, or, soloing, is, a, style, of, climbing, in, which, the, climber, climbs, alone, free, soloing, referred, to, as, soloing, in, the, uk, is, single, person, climbing, without, the, use, of, any, rope, or, protection, system, if, a, fall, occurs, the, climber, is, likely, to, be, killed, or, seriously, injured, though, technically, similar, to, bouldering, free, solo, climbing, typically, refers, to, routes, that, are, far, taller, and, or, far, more, lethal, if, a, fall, were, to, occur, than, bouldering, the, term, highball, is, used, to, refer, to, climbing, on, the, boundary, between, free, soloing, and, bouldering, where, what, is, usually, climbed, as, a, boulder, problem, may, be, high, enough, for, a, fall, to, cause, serious, injury, 20, ft, and, higher, and, hence, could, also, be, considered, to, be, a, free, solo, deep, water, soloing, or, psicobloc, is, similar, to, free, soloing, in, that, the, climber, is, unprotected, and, without, a, rope, but, should, the, climber, fall, it, is, into, deep, water, instead, of, onto, the, ground, solo, climbing, with, a, rope, secured, at, the, beginning, of, the, climb, allowing, a, climber, to, self, belay, as, they, advance, once, the, pitch, is, completed, the, soloist, must, descend, the, rope, to, retrieve, their, gear, this, form, of, climbing, can, be, conducted, free, or, as, a, form, of, aid, climbing, lead, climbing, is, a, climbing, technique, where, the, lead, climber, ascends, with, the, rope, passing, through, intermittent, anchors, that, are, below, them, rather, than, through, a, top, anchor, as, in, top, rope, climb, a, partner, belays, from, below, the, lead, climber, by, feeding, out, enough, rope, to, allow, upward, progression, without, undue, slack, as, the, leader, progresses, they, use, a, runner, and, carabiners, to, clip, the, rope, into, intermediate, points, of, protection, such, as, active, cams, or, passive, protection, such, as, nuts, this, limits, the, length, of, a, potential, fall, the, leader, also, may, clip, into, pre, placed, bolts, indoor, gyms, might, have, short, runners, pre, attached, to, fixed, anchor, points, in, the, wall, unlike, top, rope, climbing, where, the, climber, is, always, supported, by, an, anchor, located, above, them, lead, climbing, often, involves, scenarios, where, the, climber, will, be, attached, to, a, point, under, them, in, these, cases, if, the, climber, were, to, fall, the, distance, fallen, would, be, much, greater, than, that, of, top, rope, and, this, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, lead, climbing, can, be, dangerous, the, fall, factor, is, the, ratio, of, the, height, a, climber, falls, and, the, length, of, rope, available, to, absorb, the, fall, the, higher, the, fall, factor, the, more, force, placed, on, the, climber, as, the, ropes, decelerate, them, the, maximum, fall, factor, is, 2, it, is, often, advised, that, climbers, who, are, interested, in, lead, climbing, should, learn, from, experienced, climbers, and, participate, in, training, sessions, before, lead, climbing, on, their, own, the, climbing, rope, is, of, a, fixed, length, the, climber, can, only, climb, the, length, of, the, rope, routes, longer, than, the, rope, length, are, broken, up, into, several, segments, called, pitches, this, is, known, as, multi, pitch, climbing, at, the, top, of, a, pitch, the, first, climber, to, ascend, also, known, as, the, leader, sets, up, an, anchor, and, then, belays, the, second, climber, also, known, as, the, follower, up, to, the, anchor, as, the, second, climber, follows, the, route, taken, by, the, leader, the, second, climber, removes, cleans, the, carabiners, and, anchors, placed, along, the, way, in, order, to, use, them, again, on, the, next, pitch, while, cleaning, the, route, the, follower, attaches, the, carabiners, and, anchors, to, his, or, her, harness, belt, loops, once, both, climbers, are, at, the, top, anchor, the, leader, begins, climbing, the, next, pitch, and, so, on, until, the, top, of, the, route, is, reached, in, either, case, upon, completion, of, a, route, climbers, can, walk, back, down, if, an, alternate, descent, path, exists, or, rappel, abseil, down, with, the, rope, the, act, of, climbing, single, or, multi, pitch, routes, protected, by, permanently, fixed, bolts, and, anchors, drilled, into, the, rock, using, a, rope, and, the, aid, of, a, belayer, unlike, traditional, rock, climbing, sport, climbing, involves, the, use, of, protection, bolts, placed, with, power, drills, or, on, rappel, or, permanent, anchors, which, are, attached, to, the, rock, walls, this, is, separate, from, bolted, trad, climbing, traditional, or, trad, climbing, involves, rock, climbing, routes, in, which, protection, against, falls, is, placed, by, the, climber, while, ascending, typically, when, bolts, are, used, they, had, been, placed, on, lead, by, the, first, ascensionist, party, more, commonly, removable, gear, such, as, cams, hexes, and, nuts, are, placed, in, constrictions, or, cracks, in, the, rock, to, protect, against, falls, but, not, to, aid, the, ascent, directly, due, to, the, difficulty, of, placing, bolts, on, lead, bolts, tend, to, be, placed, farther, apart, than, on, many, sport, climbs, historically, pitons, a, kind, of, deformable, nail, were, placed, in, constrictions, in, the, rock, instead, of, hexes, nuts, and, cams, these, are, difficult, to, remove, and, often, destructive, to, the, rock, resulting, in, pin, scars, and, a, number, of, unremovable, fixed, pitons, on, many, older, routes, these, are, frequently, used, in, a, similar, fashion, to, bolts, although, they, are, not, as, strong, and, by, convention, are, not, considered, when, evaluating, if, a, route, is, a, trad, climb, sport, climb, or, mixed, climb, the, way, bolts, might, be, commonly, known, as, top, roping, top, rope, climbing, is, climbing, in, which, a, climber, is, belayed, from, the, ground, or, the, base, of, the, route, a, belay, system, resembling, a, pulley, in, which, an, anchor, has, been, created, at, the, top, of, a, climb, through, which, the, rope, runs, through, from, the, belayer, on, the, ground, to, the, climber, on, the, ground, position, before, starting, the, climb, the, rope, is, taken, in, to, clear, up, the, slack, as, the, climber, moves, upwards, so, in, the, event, of, a, fall, the, climber, falls, the, shortest, distance, possible, the, length, of, a, fall, is, normally, no, more, than, a, meter, but, can, vary, depending, on, the, length, of, the, route, the, longer, the, rope, the, more, stretch, the, rope, will, undergo, when, weighted, and, the, weight, of, the, climber, compared, to, that, of, the, belayer, among, other, things, belaying, a, climber, from, the, top, of, a, route, bringing, them, up, to, walk, off, or, continue, on, to, next, pitch, a, similarly, safe, system, of, climbing, a, route, as, top, roping, except, the, belayer, has, set, the, anchors, at, the, top, of, the, climb, normally, after, leading, a, route, in, which, case, the, climber, is, seconding, to, belay, the, climber, either, indirectly, belayer, is, part, of, the, system, and, can, be, vulnerable, when, exposed, to, unexpected, directions, of, pull, and, loading, of, the, rope, or, directly, belayer, is, not, part, of, the, system, and, belaying, is, done, directly, from, the, anchors, using, either, an, italian, munter, hitch, or, adapted, use, of, a, belay, device, up, the, route, from, the, top, if, bolts, have, been, clipped, or, traditional, gear, placements, have, been, made, it, is, the, job, of, the, climber, to, collect, and, clean, the, route, different, types, of, rock, require, different, techniques, to, successfully, climb, in, crack, climbing, the, climber, ascends, a, rock, crack, using, specific, techniques, such, as, jamming, stemming, and, laying, back, cracks, can, vary, in, size, from, smaller, than, the, width, of, a, finger, to, larger, than, human, body, size, climbers, may, protect, their, hands, from, sharp, edged, rock, with, tape, face, climbing, is, a, type, of, climbing, where, climbers, use, features, and, irregularities, in, the, rock, such, as, finger, pockets, and, edges, to, ascend, a, vertical, rock, face, slab, climbing, also, known, as, friction, climbing, is, classified, by, the, slope, of, the, rock, a, slope, for, slab, climbing, is, less, than, ninety, degrees, and, prioritizes, footwork, it, is, also, known, as, friction, climbing, and, although, this, might, sound, easy, slab, is, considered, one, of, the, more, challenging, types, of, climbing, popular, techniques, for, slab, are, smearing, maintaining, a, center, of, gravity, and, high, steps, two, of, the, most, renowned, locations, for, slab, climbing, are, joshua, tree, and, yosemite, but, the, looking, glass, mountain, and, moab, are, also, great, options, the, hardest, slab, route, ever, climbed, is, cryptography, located, in, saint, loup, switzerland, and, ascended, by, alessandro, zeni, short, for, simultaneous, simul, climbing, is, when, two, climbers, move, at, the, same, time, the, pseudo, lead, climber, places, gear, that, the, pseudo, follower, collects, when, the, leader, runs, low, on, gear, they, construct, a, belay, station, where, the, follower, can, join, them, to, exchange, gear, the, stronger, climber, is, often, the, pseudo, follower, since, a, fall, by, the, follower, would, pull, the, leader, from, below, towards, the, last, piece, of, gear, a, potentially, devastating, fall, for, the, leader, in, contrast, a, fall, from, the, leader, would, pull, the, follower, from, above, resulting, in, a, less, serious, fall, most, speed, ascents, involve, some, form, of, simul, climbing, but, may, also, include, sections, of, standard, free, climbing, and, the, use, of, placed, gear, for, advancement, i, e, partial, aid, or, pulling, on, gear, in, early, america, the, cliff, dwelling, anasazi, in, the, 12th, century, are, thought, to, have, been, excellent, climbers, early, european, climbers, used, rock, climbing, techniques, to, reach, the, summits, in, their, mountaineering, exploits, in, the, 1880s, european, rock, climbing, became, an, independent, pursuit, outside, of, mountain, climbing, although, rock, climbing, was, an, important, component, of, victorian, mountaineering, in, the, alps, it, is, generally, thought, that, the, sport, of, rock, climbing, began, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, various, parts, of, europe, rock, climbing, evolved, gradually, from, an, alpine, necessity, to, a, distinct, athletic, activity, from, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, founder, of, the, alpine, club, john, ball, researched, and, made, known, the, dolomites, he, was, followed, there, by, many, other, climbers, such, as, paul, grohmann, edward, r, whitwell, michael, innerkofler, angelo, dibona, and, tita, piaz, with, many, first, ascents, just, before, the, first, world, war, there, was, a, so, called, mauerhakenstreit, german, the, great, piton, debate, of, 1911, in, central, europe, regarding, the, use, of, aids, in, climbing, and, mountaineering, paul, preuss, and, hans, d, lfer, were, the, main, actors, in, these, discussions, which, have, essentially, continued, to, this, day, preuss, propagated, a, pure, climbing, style, angelo, dibona, on, the, other, hand, was, an, advocate, of, security, and, was, not, fundamentally, averse, to, pitons, when, luis, trenker, asked, how, many, pitons, he, had, hit, in, total, in, life, dibona, replied, fifteen, six, of, them, on, the, laliderer, north, face, three, on, the, dstein, two, on, the, croz, dell, altissimo, one, on, the, einser, and, the, rest, on, other, difficult, climbs, aid, climbing, climbing, using, equipment, that, acts, as, artificial, handhold, or, footholds, became, popular, during, the, period, 1920, 1960, leading, to, ascents, in, the, alps, and, in, yosemite, valley, that, were, considered, impossible, without, such, means, however, climbing, techniques, equipment, and, ethical, considerations, have, evolved, steadily, today, free, climbing, climbing, using, holds, made, entirely, of, natural, rock, while, using, gear, solely, for, protection, and, not, for, upward, movement, is, the, most, popular, form, of, the, sport, free, climbing, has, since, been, divided, into, several, sub, styles, of, climbing, dependent, on, belay, configuration, over, time, grading, systems, have, also, been, created, in, order, to, compare, more, accurately, the, relative, difficulties, of, the, rock, climbs, on, august, 3, 2016, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, formally, announced, that, sport, climbing, would, be, a, medal, sport, in, the, 2020, summer, olympics, the, event, debut, was, postponed, to, 2021, due, to, covid, 19, climbing, communities, in, many, countries, and, regions, have, developed, their, own, rating, systems, for, routes, ratings, or, grades, record, and, communicate, consensus, appraisals, of, difficulty, systems, of, ratings, are, inherently, subjective, in, nature, and, variation, of, difficulty, can, be, seen, between, two, climbs, of, the, same, grade, hence, there, may, be, occasional, disagreements, arising, from, physiological, or, stylistic, differences, among, climbers, the, practice, of, rating, a, climb, below, its, actual, difficulty, is, known, as, sandbagging, the, most, commonly, used, rating, systems, in, the, united, states, are, the, yosemite, decimal, system, and, the, hueco, v, scale, bouldering, grade, the, current, ranges, for, climbing, routes, are, 5, 0, for, easy, beginner, routes, to, 5, 15, being, world, class, and, v0, v17, respectively, as, the, limit, of, human, climbing, ability, has, not, yet, been, reached, neither, grading, system, has, a, definite, endpoint, and, they, are, thus, subject, to, revision, the, ratings, take, into, account, multiple, factors, affecting, a, route, such, as, the, slope, of, the, ascent, the, quantity, and, quality, of, available, handholds, the, distance, between, holds, ease, of, placing, protection, and, whether, advanced, technical, maneuvers, are, required, typically, the, rating, for, the, hardest, move, on, the, wall, will, be, the, rating, for, the, whole, climb, while, the, height, of, a, route, is, generally, not, considered, a, factor, a, long, series, of, sustained, hard, moves, will, often, merit, a, higher, grade, than, a, single, move, of, the, same, technical, difficulty, for, example, a, climb, with, multiple, 5, 11, moves, with, no, rests, may, thus, be, rated, a, 5, 12, as, climbing, routes, or, problems, increase, in, difficulty, climbers, learn, to, develop, skills, that, help, them, complete, the, climbs, clean, there, are, several, techniques, for, hands, and, feet, as, well, as, terms, for, motions, that, combine, the, two, for, indoor, gyms, route, setters, visualize, and, create, routes, for, climbers, placing, different, kinds, of, holds, in, specific, parts, of, the, wall, at, particular, angles, because, they, intend, climbers, to, use, certain, techniques, jug, a, large, open, hold, typically, in, the, shape, of, a, v, sloper, a, negative, smooth, hold, typically, in, the, shape, of, a, ball, or, half, moon, pockets, a, hold, that, has, a, hole, in, it, with, just, enough, room, for, one, or, two, fingers, to, fit, inside, of, it, horn, a, protruding, hold, that, is, typically, smooth, like, a, sloper, these, are, held, by, wrapping, your, arm, or, entire, palm, around, the, hold, the, more, surface, area, you, have, on, this, hold, the, better, pinch, a, pinch, can, either, be, used, vertically, or, horizontally, with, a, pinch, hold, the, muscles, between, the, index, finger, and, thumb, are, used, crimp, crimper, a, crimp, hold, allows, climbers, to, use, their, fingertips, to, grab, edges, the, fingers, arch, ar, te, a, sharp, corner, or, vertical, edge, volume, volumes, are, wood, or, fiberglass, structures, that, are, supported, by, the, climbing, wall, they, are, generally, giant, prism, like, features, that, are, introduced, to, change, the, dynamics, of, the, wall, in, europe, large, climbing, holds, can, be, considered, volumes, while, in, the, us, the, actual, surface, volume, of, the, wall, is, changed, by, a, volume, crack, a, gap, between, two, opposing, walls, that, a, climber, can, jam, their, fingers, fist, or, other, body, parts, in, to, pull, themselves, up, indoor, climbing, occurs, in, buildings, on, artificial, rock, structures, this, permits, for, climbing, in, all, types, of, weather, and, at, all, times, of, the, day, climbers, climb, indoors, to, improve, their, skills, and, techniques, as, well, as, for, general, exercise, or, fun, indoor, climbing, gyms, typically, provide, rope, setups, and, ensure, that, new, climbers, know, safe, techniques, outdoors, climbs, usually, take, place, on, sunny, days, when, the, holds, are, dry, and, provide, the, best, grip, but, climbers, can, also, attempt, to, climb, at, night, or, in, adverse, weather, conditions, if, they, have, the, proper, training, and, equipment, however, night, climbing, or, climbing, in, adverse, weather, conditions, will, increase, the, difficulty, and, danger, on, any, climbing, route, most, climbers, choose, to, wear, specialized, rubber, climbing, shoes, which, are, often, of, a, smaller, size, than, their, normal, street, shoes, in, order, to, improve, sensitivity, towards, foot, placements, and, use, the, tightness, to, their, advantage, climbing, chalk, mgco, 3, is, commonly, used, as, a, drying, agent, to, minimize, sweating, of, the, hands, most, other, equipment, is, of, a, protective, nature, rock, climbing, is, inherently, dangerous, so, to, minimize, the, potential, consequences, resulting, from, a, fall, climbers, use, protection, the, most, basic, protective, equipment, is, a, climbing, rope, climbing, pioneers, would, attach, the, rope, to, themselves, in, the, event, of, a, fall, the, rope, would, usually, cause, injury, to, the, climber, in, the, hope, that, it, prevented, death, with, advances, in, technology, came, the, development, of, specialized, harnesses, carabiners, which, are, used, for, clipping, into, belay, and, rappel, anchors, and, connecting, gear, and, belay, devices, which, are, used, to, catch, a, falling, climber, hold, or, lower, a, climber, and, for, rappelling, eventually, the, placement, of, bolts, with, the, use, of, quickdraws, led, to, the, rise, of, sport, climbing, traditional, climbers, developed, the, spring, loaded, camming, device, which, allowed, a, wider, variety, of, climbing, styles, to, be, adequately, protected, compared, to, chocks, and, hexes, traditionally, pitons, were, used, however, in, most, areas, protection, which, damages, the, rock, is, discouraged, most, climbers, choose, to, wear, a, specialized, climbing, helmet, to, protect, them, from, falling, rocks, or, equipment, or, head, injuries, from, crashing, into, rocks, injuries, in, rock, climbing, are, mainly, sports, injuries, that, occur, due, to, overuse, or, falls, however, injuries, due, to, falls, are, relatively, uncommon, the, vast, majority, of, injuries, result, from, overuse, most, often, occurring, in, the, fingers, elbows, and, shoulders, such, injuries, are, often, no, worse, than, torn, calluses, cuts, burns, and, bruises, but, overuse, symptoms, if, ignored, may, lead, to, permanent, damage, especially, to, tendons, tendon, sheaths, ligaments, and, capsules, to, help, address, these, issues, there, are, a, number, of, products, specifically, for, climbers, available, in, the, market, for, example, taping, of, fingers, and, elbows, to, prevent, injuries, is, common, practice, and, there, are, various, products, and, techniques, for, taping, illustrated, photo, topos, are, widely, used, in, rock, climbing, many, of, them, are, found, in, climbing, and, mountaineering, guidebooks, such, as, those, published, by, rockfax, or, the, british, mountaineering, council, full, colour, photo, topo, diagrams, have, replaced, the, previous, generation, of, text, based, guidebooks, which, were, illustrated, with, hand, drawn, diagrams, the, use, of, drones, has, helped, improve, the, quality, of, images, of, many, of, the, cliffs, some, areas, that, are, popular, for, climbing, for, example, in, the, united, states, and, australia, are, also, sacred, places, for, indigenous, peoples, many, such, indigenous, people, would, prefer, that, climbers, not, climb, these, sacred, places, and, have, made, this, information, well, known, to, climbers, a, well, known, example, is, the, rock, formation, that, americans, have, named, devils, tower, national, monument, native, american, cultural, concerns, also, led, to, complete, climbing, closures, at, cave, rock, at, lake, tahoe, monument, valley, shiprock, and, canyon, de, chelly, climbing, activities, can, sometimes, encroach, on, rock, art, sites, the, potential, threat, to, these, resources, has, led, to, climbing, restrictions, and, closures, in, places, like, hueco, tanks, texas, and, portions, of, city, of, rocks, national, reserve, idaho, in, australia, the, monolith, uluru, ayers, rock, is, sacred, to, local, indigenous, communities, and, climbing, is, banned, elsewhere, in, australia, many, formerly, popular, climbing, routes, in, areas, such, as, the, grampians, and, arapiles, have, been, closed, or, partially, closed, due, to, indigenous, cultural, concerns, indigenous, peoples, are, not, the, only, cultures, that, object, to, climbing, on, certain, rock, formations, professional, climber, dean, potter, kicked, off, a, major, controversy, when, he, ignored, long, accepted, convention, to, scale, delicate, arch, in, 2006, resulting, in, strict, new, climbing, regulations, in, arches, national, park, many, significant, rock, outcrops, exist, on, private, land, some, people, within, the, rock, climbing, community, have, been, guilty, of, trespassing, in, many, cases, often, after, land, ownership, transfers, and, previous, access, permission, is, withdrawn, in, the, u, s, the, climbing, community, responded, to, access, closures, by, forming, the, access, fund, this, is, an, advocacy, organization, that, keeps, u, s, climbing, areas, open, and, conserves, the, climbing, environment, five, core, programs, support, the, mission, on, national, and, local, levels, public, policy, stewardship, and, conservation, including, grants, grassroots, activism, climber, education, and, land, acquisition, in, the, u, k, the, british, mountaineering, council, represents, climbers, and, their, interest, of, public, access, to, crags, cliffs, and, boulders, in, europe, there, are, different, rules, in, different, countries, regarding, the, rights, of, landowners, and, climbers, although, many, climbers, adhere, to, minimal, impact, and, leave, no, trace, practices, rock, climbing, is, sometimes, damaging, to, the, environment, common, environmental, damages, include, soil, erosion, breaking, rock, features, chalk, accumulation, litter, abandoned, bolts, and, ropes, human, excrement, introduction, of, foreign, plants, through, seeds, on, shoes, and, clothing, as, well, as, damage, to, native, plant, species, especially, those, growing, in, cracks, and, on, ledges, as, these, are, often, intentionally, removed, during, new, route, development, through, a, process, commonly, referred, to, as, cleaning, the, introduction, of, fixed, anchors, and, bolts, in, climbing, areas, have, brought, lasting, changes, to, landscapes, drilling, and, placement, of, anchors, and, bolts, has, contributed, to, rock, degradation, this, impacts, the, visual, appeal, and, ecological, stability, of, the, climbing, site, safety, equipment, implementation, into, natural, landscapes, is, practice, that, can, heavily, alter, or, impact, an, ecosystem, that, relies, on, structure, arid, landscapes, that, are, often, desirable, for, rock, climbing, commonly, have, fragile, soil, dynamics, that, can, be, easily, disturbed, by, human, activities, popular, climbing, areas, have, been, significantly, altered, due, to, indiscriminate, altering, of, the, landscape, the, leave, no, trace, practice, is, something, that, cannot, be, obtained, without, proper, knowledge, of, what, types, of, traces, to, avoid, clean, climbing, is, a, style, of, rock, climbing, which, seeks, to, minimize, some, of, the, aesthetically, damaging, side, effects, of, some, techniques, used, in, trad, climbing, and, more, often, aid, climbing, by, avoiding, using, equipment, such, as, pitons, which, damage, rock, climbing, can, also, interfere, with, raptor, nesting, since, the, two, activities, often, take, place, on, the, same, precipitous, cliffs, many, climbing, area, land, managers, institute, nesting, season, closures, of, cliffs, known, to, be, used, by, protected, birds, of, prey, like, eagles, falcons, and, osprey, many, non, climbers, also, object, to, the, appearance, of, climbing, chalk, marks, anchors, bolts, and, slings, on, visible, cliffs, since, these, features, are, small, visual, impacts, can, be, mitigated, through, the, selection, of, neutral, rock, matching, colors, for, bolt, hangers, webbing, and, chalk, the, use, of, certain, types, of, climbing, gear, is, banned, altogether, at, some, crags, due, to, the, risk, of, damage, to, the, rock, face, in, such, cases, climbers, use, knotted, slings, and, ropes, for, climbing, protection, blowtorching, is, another, climbing, induced, impact, that, affects, the, rocks, themselves, blowtorching, is, when, a, climber, uses, a, blowtorch, to, dry, holds, on, a, wet, route, this, mainly, happens, in, areas, that, tend, to, have, wet, climbing, conditions, blowtorching, is, not, only, detrimental, to, the, rock, itself, and, can, have, permanent, damage, but, it, also, leaves, a, very, large, burn, mark, that, most, non, climbers, would, object, to, the, most, significant, form, of, vandalism, directly, attributable, to, rock, climbers, is, the, alteration, of, the, climbing, surface, to, render, it, more, climber, friendly, today, the, charge, of, vandalism, in, climbing, is, more, often, a, disagreement, with, land, managers, over, the, appropriateness, of, drilling, and, placing, permanent, bolts, and, other, anchors, although, new, fixed, anchors, are, rarely, placed, by, climbers, repeating, an, ascent, their, dependency, on, the, existing, fixed, anchors, results, in, the, difference, between, life, and, death, however, the, existing, anchors, remain, on, the, climbing, structure, for, long, periods, of, time, and, in, cases, where, old, or, inappropriate, hardware, was, installed, can, leave, permanent, stains, on, the, rock, face, due, to, the, permanent, nature, of, fixed, anchors, they, were, prohibited, by, the, wilderness, act, however, in, 1990, there, was, a, movement, by, the, forest, service, and, the, task, group, to, change, the, regulations, such, that, fixed, anchors, would, be, allowed, but, still, regulated, in, wilderness, areas, these, improvements, led, to, protection, for, both, the, climbers, and, the, wilderness, act
