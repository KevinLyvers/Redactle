is, very, large, in, proportion, to, the, body, and, the, cranium, is, enormous, relative, to, his, or, her, face, while, the, adult, human, skull, is, about, one, seventh, of, the, total, body, length, the, newborn, s, is, about, 1, 4, normal, head, circumference, for, a, full, term, infant, is, 33, 36, cm, at, birth, at, birth, many, regions, of, the, newborn, s, skull, have, not, yet, been, converted, to, bone, leaving, soft, spots, known, as, fontanels, the, two, largest, are, the, diamond, shaped, anterior, fontanel, located, at, the, top, front, portion, of, the, head, and, the, smaller, triangular, shaped, posterior, fontanel, which, lies, at, the, back, of, the, head, later, in, the, child, s, life, these, bones, will, fuse, together, in, a, natural, process, a, protein, called, noggin, is, responsible, for, the, delay, in, an, infant, s, skull, fusion, during, labour, and, birth, the, infant, s, skull, changes, shape, to, fit, through, the, birth, canal, sometimes, causing, the, child, to, be, born, with, a, misshapen, or, elongated, head, it, will, usually, return, to, normal, on, its, own, within, a, few, days, or, weeks, special, exercises, sometimes, advised, by, physicians, may, assist, the, process, some, newborns, have, a, fine, downy, body, hair, called, lanugo, it, may, be, particularly, noticeable, on, the, back, shoulders, forehead, ears, and, face, of, premature, infants, lanugo, disappears, within, a, few, weeks, infants, may, be, born, with, full, heads, of, hair, others, particularly, caucasian, infants, may, have, very, fine, hair, or, may, even, be, bald, amongst, fair, skinned, parents, this, fine, hair, may, be, blonde, even, if, the, parents, are, not, an, infant, s, hair, color, and, texture, can, change, red, can,

hairless, newborns, and, the, area, around, the, eyes, may, be, puffy, in, developed, countries, the, average, total, body, length, of, a, newborn, is, 35, 6, 50, 8, cm, 14, 0, 20, 0, in, although, premature, newborns, may, be, much, smaller, the, way, to, measure, a, baby, s, length, is, to, lay, the, baby, down, and, stretch, a, measuring, tape, from, the, top, of, the, head, to, the, bottom, of, the, heel, in, developed, countries, the, average, birth, weight, of, a, full, term, newborn, is, approximately, 3, 4, kg, 7, 1, 2, lb, and, is, typically, in, the, range, of, 2, 7, 4, 6, kg, 6, 0, 10, 1, lb, over, the, first, 5, 7, days, following, birth, the, body, weight, of, a, term, neonate, decreases, by, 3, 7, and, is, largely, a, result, of, the, resorption, and, urination, of, the, fluid, that, initially, fills, the, lungs, in, addition, to, a, delay, of, often, a, few, days, before, breastfeeding, becomes, effective, after, the, first, week, healthy, term, neonates, should, gain, 10, 20, grams, kg, day, immediately, after, birth, a, newborn, s, skin, is, often, grayish, to, dusky, blue, in, color, as, soon, as, the, newborn, begins, to, breathe, usually, within, a, minute, or, two, the, skin, s, color, reaches, its, normal, tone, newborns, are, wet, covered, in, streaks, of, blood, and, coated, with, a, white, substance, known, as, vernix, caseosa, which, is, hypothesised, to, act, as, an, antibacterial, barrier, the, newborn, may, also, have, mongolian, spots, various, other, birthmarks, or, peeling, skin, particularly, on, the, wrists, hands, ankles, and, feet, the, umbilical, cord, of, a, newborn, is, bluish, white, in, color, after, birth, the, umbilical, cord, is, normally, cut, leaving, a, 1, 2, inch, stub, the, umbilical, stub, will, dry, out, shrivel, darken, and, spontaneously, fall, off, within, about, 3, weeks, this, will, later, become, a, belly, button, after, it, heals, the, umbilical, cord, contains, three, vessels, two, arteries, and, one, vein, the, two, arteries, carry, blood, from, the, baby, to, the, placenta, while, one, vein, carries, blood, back, to, the, baby, a, newborn, s, genitals, are, enlarged, and, reddened, with, male, infants, having, an, unusually, large, scrotum, the, breasts, may, also, be, enlarged, even, in, male, infants, this, is, caused, by, naturally, occurring, maternal, hormones, and, is, a, temporary, condition, females, and, even, males, may, actually, discharge, milk, from, their, nipples, sometimes, called, witch, s, milk, or, a, bloody, or, milky, like, substance, from, the, vagina, in, either, case, this, is, considered, normal, and, will, disappear, with, time, infants, cry, as, a, form, of, basic, instinctive, communication, a, crying, infant, may, be, trying, to, express, a, variety, of, feelings, including, hunger, discomfort, overstimulation, boredom, wanting, something, or, loneliness, infants, are, altricial, and, are, fully, dependent, on, their, mothers, or, an, adult, caretaker, for, an, extended, period, of, time, breastfeeding, is, the, recommended, method, of, feeding, by, all, major, infant, health, organizations, if, breastfeeding, is, not, possible, or, desired, bottle, feeding, is, done, with, expressed, breast, milk, or, with, infant, formula, infants, are, born, with, a, sucking, reflex, allowing, them, to, extract, the, milk, from, the, nipples, of, the, breasts, or, the, nipple, of, the, baby, bottle, as, well, as, an, instinctive, behavior, known, as, rooting, with, which, they, seek, out, the, nipple, sometimes, a, wet, nurse, is, hired, to, feed, the, infant, although, this, is, rare, especially, in, developed, countries, adequate, food, consumption, at, an, early, age, is, vital, for, an, infant, s, development, the, foundations, of, optimum, health, growth, and, neurodevelopment, across, the, lifespan, are, established, in, the, first, 1, 000, days, of, life, from, birth, to, six, months, infants, should, consume, only, breast, milk, or, an, unmodified, milk, substitute, as, an, infant, s, diet, matures, finger, foods, may, be, introduced, as, well, as, fruit, vegetables, and, small, amounts, of, meat, as, infants, grow, food, supplements, can, be, added, many, parents, choose, commercial, ready, made, baby, foods, to, supplement, breast, milk, or, formula, for, the, child, while, others, adapt, their, usual, meals, for, the, dietary, needs, of, their, child, whole, cow, s, milk, can, be, used, at, one, year, but, lower, fat, milk, is, not, recommended, until, the, child, is, two, to, three, years, old, weaning, is, the, process, through, which, breast, milk, is, eliminated, from, the, infant, s, diet, through, the, introduction, of, solid, foods, in, exchange, for, milk, until, they, are, toilet, trained, infants, in, industrialized, countries, wear, diapers, the, transition, from, diapers, to, training, pants, is, an, important, transition, in, the, development, of, an, infant, baby, to, that, of, a, toddler, children, need, more, sleep, than, adults, up, to, 18, hours, for, newborn, babies, with, a, declining, rate, as, the, child, ages, until, babies, learn, to, walk, they, are, carried, in, the, arms, held, in, slings, or, baby, carriers, or, transported, in, baby, carriages, or, strollers, most, industrialized, countries, have, laws, requiring, child, safety, seats, for, babies, in, motor, vehicles, experiments, have, been, done, with, infants, up, to, four, months, of, age, using, both, positive, touch, stroking, or, cuddling, and, negative, touch, poking, pinching, or, tickling, the, infants, who, received, the, positive, touch, cried, less, often, and, vocalized, and, smiled, more, than, the, infants, who, were, touched, negatively, infants, who, were, the, recipients, of, negative, touch, have, also, been, linked, with, emotional, and, behavioral, problems, later, in, life, a, lower, amount, of, physical, violence, in, adults, has, been, discovered, in, cultures, with, greater, levels, of, positive, physical, touching, caregivers, of, an, infant, are, advised, to, pick, up, on, the, infant, s, facial, expressions, and, mirror, them, reproducing, and, empathizing, with, their, facial, expressions, enables, infants, to, experience, effectiveness, and, to, recognize, their, own, actions, more, easily, see, mirror, neurons, exaggeratedly, reproduced, facial, expressions, and, gestures, are, recommended, as, they, are, clearer, forms, of, expression, the, baby, s, babbling, should, also, be, picked, up, and, repeated, by, imitating, each, other, s, sounds, the, first, simple, dialogues, are, initiated, accentuated, pronunciation, and, melodic, intonation, make, it, easier, to, recognize, individual, words, in, a, sentence, however, it, is, not, advisable, to, use, simplified, baby, talk, e, g, did, you, ouch, instead, of, did, you, hurt, yourself, even, if, parents, cannot, yet, understand, infants, babbling, a, timely, response, by, parents, to, babbling, leads, to, faster, language, acquisition, this, was, confirmed, by, researchers, who, first, studied, mothers, behavior, towards, 8, month, old, infants, and, later, tested, the, infants, vocabulary, when, they, were, 15, months, old, a, first, important, development, of, infants, is, the, discovery, that, they, can, influence, their, parents, through, babbling, development, of, intentional, communication, parents, can, encourage, this, by, engaging, with, their, infants, in, babbling, this, in, turn, promotes, further, language, development, as, infants, then, turn, to, their, parents, more, often, previous, studies, have, shown, that, the, infant, s, speech, is, encouraged, when, parents, for, example, smile, in, the, infant, s, direction, or, touch, the, infant, every, time, the, infant, looks, at, them, and, babbles, it, also, helps, if, parents, respond, to, what, they, think, their, baby, is, saying, for, example, giving, a, ball, or, commenting, when, the, baby, looks, at, the, ball, and, babbles, responding, to, sounds, produced, when, the, baby, looks, at, an, object, object, directed, vocalizations, thus, provide, an, opportunity, to, learn, the, name, of, the, object, in, this, way, babies, also, learn, that, sounds, are, associated, with, objects, however, language, development, is, only, achieved, if, parents, react, positively, e, g, smile, in, response, to, the, infant, s, babbling, a, high, response, rate, without, a, connection, to, the, infant, s, utterances, does, not, lead, to, language, promotion, it, is, detrimental, to, language, development, if, a, mother, instead, tries, to, divert, the, infant, s, attention, to, something, else, a, 2018, review, analysed, 146, studies, on, infant, sleep, behavior, and, listed, several, factors, that, show, an, effect, on, sleep, duration, and, the, number, of, night, awakenings, however, research, has, indicated, that, frequent, wakings, are, protective, of, sids, infant, sleep, is, not, linear, ebbing, and, flowing, with, developmental, milestones, and, age, the, national, sleep, foundation, gives, a, rough, recommendation, on, sleep, hours, that, commonly, decreases, with, increasing, age, maternal, sensitivity, plays, a, particular, role, in, the, relationship, with, the, infant, and, for, favorable, emotional, development, this, means, being, attentive, to, the, infant, s, behavioral, expressions, not, misinterpreting, the, infant, s, expressions, because, of, one, s, own, moods, reacting, immediately, to, the, situation, and, finding, a, response, that, is, appropriate, to, the, context, and, the, expressed, needs, a, secure, attachment, is, promoted, through, empathetic, and, adequate, as, well, as, prompt, responses, in, accordance, with, their, basic, needs, infants, show, an, inborn, behavior, of, seeking, closeness, to, the, mother, or, to, another, primary, caregiver, and, thus, in, turn, foster, an, attachment, when, separated, from, the, mother, infants, protest, by, crying, and, by, body, movements, wearing, has, a, calming, effect, on, infants, a, 2013, study, showed, that, infants, placed, in, a, cradle, cried, and, kicked, more, often, and, had, an, increased, heart, rate, so, the, infants, were, stressed, while, those, picked, up, and, carried, by, the, mother, while, walking, around, calmed, down, significantly, the, effect, of, being, held, motionless, in, the, arm, was, intermediate, between, that, of, being, carried, around, and, that, of, being, put, down, that, carrying, e, g, in, a, baby, sling, makes, infants, more, content, and, makes, them, cry, less, had, already, been, shown, in, a, randomized, study, in, 1986, for, infant, feeding, breastfeeding, is, recommended, by, all, major, infant, health, organizations, many, airlines, refuse, boarding, for, all, babies, aged, under, 7, days, for, domestic, flights, or, 14, days, for, international, flights, asiana, airlines, allows, babies, to, board, international, flights, at, 7, days, of, age, garuda, indonesia, disallows, all, babies, under, the, age, of, 14, days, to, board, any, flights, delta, air, lines, allows, infants, to, travel, when, they, are, less, than, 7, days, old, when, they, present, a, physician, travel, approval, letter, skywest, will, not, allow, an, infant, less, than, 8, days, old, on, board, attachment, theory, is, primarily, an, evolutionary, and, ethological, theory, whereby, the, infant, or, child, seeks, proximity, to, a, specified, attachment, figure, in, situations, of, alarm, or, distress, for, the, purpose, of, survival, the, forming, of, attachments, is, considered, to, be, the, foundation, of, the, infant, child, s, capacity, to, form, and, conduct, relationships, throughout, life, attachment, is, not, the, same, as, love, or, affection, although, they, often, go, together, attachment, and, attachment, behaviors, tend, to, develop, between, the, age, of, six, months, and, 3, years, infants, become, attached, to, adults, who, are, sensitive, and, responsive, in, social, interactions, with, the, infant, and, who, remain, as, consistent, caregivers, for, some, time, parental, responses, lead, to, the, development, of, patterns, of, attachment, which, in, turn, lead, to, internal, working, models, which, will, guide, the, individual, s, feelings, thoughts, and, expectations, in, later, relationships, there, are, a, number, of, attachment, styles, namely, secure, anxious, ambivalent, anxious, avoidant, all, organized, and, disorganized, some, of, which, are, more, problematic, than, others, a, lack, of, attachment, or, a, seriously, disrupted, capacity, for, attachment, could, potentially, amount, to, serious, disorders, infants, develop, distinct, relationships, to, their, mothers, fathers, siblings, and, non, familial, caregivers, beside, the, dyadic, attachment, relationships, also, a, good, quality, of, the, triadic, relationships, mother, father, infant, is, important, for, infant, mental, health, development, infants, respond, to, the, sound, of, snake, hissing, angry, voices, of, adults, the, crackling, sound, of, a, fire, thunder, and, the, cries, of, other, infants, they, have, a, drop, in, heart, rate, their, eyes, blinking, increased, turning, toward, the, speakers, or, parent, all, of, these, indicating, that, they, were, paying, more, attention, this, is, believed, to, be, an, evolutionary, response, to, danger, babies, ability, to, accurately, locate, sounds, is, refined, during, their, first, year, the, infant, is, undergoing, many, adaptations, to, extrauterine, life, and, its, physiological, systems, such, as, the, immune, system, are, far, from, fully, developed, potential, diseases, of, concern, during, the, neonatal, period, include, infant, mortality, is, the, death, of, an, infant, in, the, first, year, of, life, often, expressed, as, the, number, of, deaths, per, 1, 000, live, births, infant, mortality, rate, major, causes, of, infant, mortality, include, dehydration, infection, congenital, malformation, and, sids, this, epidemiological, indicator, is, recognized, as, a, very, important, measure, of, the, level, of, health, care, in, a, country, because, it, is, directly, linked, with, the, health, status, of, infants, children, and, pregnant, women, as, well, as, access, to, medical, care, socioeconomic, conditions, and, public, health, practices, there, is, a, positive, relationship, between, national, wealth, and, good, health, the, rich, and, industrialized, countries, of, the, world, prominently, canada, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, japan, spend, a, large, proportion, of, their, wealthy, budget, on, the, health, care, system, as, a, result, their, health, care, systems, are, very, sophisticated, with, many, physicians, nurses, and, other, health, care, experts, servicing, the, population, thus, infant, mortality, is, low, on, the, other, hand, a, country, such, as, mexico, which, spends, disproportionately, less, of, its, budget, on, healthcare, suffers, from, high, mortality, rates, this, is, because, the, general, population, is, likely, to, be, less, healthy, in, the, u, s, infant, mortality, rates, are, especially, high, in, minority, groups, for, instance, non, hispanic, black, women, have, an, infant, mortality, rate, of, 13, 63, per, 1, 000, live, births, whereas, in, non, hispanic, white, women, it, was, much, lower, at, a, rate, of, 5, 76, per, 1, 000, live, births, the, average, infant, mortality, rate, in, the, u, s, is, 6, 8, per, 1, 000, live, births, babyhood, is, a, critical, period, in, personality, development, when, the, foundations, of, adult, personality, are, laid, in, contrast, toddler, is, used, to, denote, a, baby, that, has, achieved, relative, independence, in, moving, about, and, feeding
