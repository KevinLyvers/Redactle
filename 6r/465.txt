bobsleigh, or, bobsled, is, a, winter, sport, in, which, teams, of, 2, to, 4, athletes, make, timed, runs, down, narrow, twisting, banked, iced, tracks, in, a, gravity, powered, sleigh, international, bobsleigh, competitions, are, governed, by, the, international, bobsleigh, and, skeleton, federation, formerly, the, fibt, the, first, bobsleds, were, built, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, st, moritz, switzerland, by, wealthy, tourists, from, victorian, britain, who, were, staying, at, the, palace, hotel, owned, by, caspar, badrutt, the, early, sleds, were, adapted, from, boys, delivery, sleds, and, toboggans, these, eventually, evolved, into, bobsleighs, luges, and, skeletons, initially, the, tourists, would, race, their, hand, built, contraptions, down, the, narrow, streets, of, st, moritz, however, as, collisions, increased, growing, opposition, from, st, moritz, residents, led, to, bobsledding, being, eventually, banned, from, public, highways, in, the, winter, of, 1884, badrutt, had, a, purpose, built, run, constructed, near, the, hamlet, of, cresta, the, cresta, run, remains, the, oldest, in, the, world, and, is, the, home, of, the, st, moritz, tobogganing, club, it, has, hosted, two, olympic, winter, games, and, as, of, 2022, was, still, in, use, modern, bobsleigh, teams, compete, to, complete, a, downhill, route, in, the, fastest, times, an, aggregate, time, from, several, runs, is, used, to, determine, the, winners, the, four, man, event, has, been, featured, since, the, first, winter, games, in, 1924, in, chamonix, france, the, only, exception, was, the, 1960, games, in, squaw, valley, when, the, organizing, committee, decided, not, to, build, a, track, to, reduce, costs, the, two, man, event, was, introduced, at, the, 1932, games, and, a, two, woman, event, was, first, contested, at, the, 2002, winter, olympics, the, women, s, monobob, event, was, introduced, in, the, 2022, games, the, name, is, derived, from, the, action, some, early, competitors, adopted, of, bobbing, back, and, forth, inside, their, sleds, to, increase, speed, although, sledding, on, snow, or, ice, had, long, been, popular, in, many, northern, countries, the, origins, of, bobsleighing, as, a, modern, sport, are, relatively, recent, it, developed, after, hotelier, caspar, badrutt, 1848, 1904, convinced, some, wealthy, english, regular, guests, to, remain, through, the, entire, winter, at, his, hotel, in, the, mineral, spa, town, of, st, moritz, switzerland, he, had, been, frustrated, that, his, hotel, was, only, busy, during, the, summer, months, by, keeping, his, guests, entertained, with, food, alcohol, and, activities, he, quickly, established, the, concept, of, winter, resorting, within, a, few, years, wintering, at, badrutt, s, st, moritz, hotel, became, very, fashionable, in, victorian, britain, however, with, increased, numbers, this, led, some, guests, to, search, for, new, diversions, in, the, early, 1870s, some, adventurous, englishmen, began, adapting, boys, delivery, sleds, for, recreational, purposes, however, when, they, began, colliding, with, pedestrians, in, the, icy, lanes, alleyways, and, roads, of, st, moritz, this, led, to, the, invention, of, steering, means, for, the, sleds, the, basic, bobsleigh, bobsled, consisted, of, two, crestas, skeleton, sleds, attached, together, with, a, board, that, had, a, steering, mechanism, at, the, front, the, ability, to, steer, meant, the, sleds, could, make, longer, runs, through, the, town, longer, runs, also, meant, higher, speeds, on, curves, local, sentiment, about, these, informal, competitions, varied, but, eventually, complaints, grew, so, vociferous, that, badrutt, had, to, do, something, his, solution, in, the, late, 1870s, was, to, build, a, basic, natural, ice, run, for, his, guests, outside, the, town, near, the, small, hamlet, named, cresta, he, took, action, because, he, did, not, want, to, make, enemies, in, the, town, and, he, had, worked, hard, and, invested, a, lot, of, time, and, money, in, popularizing, wintering, in, st, moritz, so, he, was, not, going, to, let, boredom, induce, customers, not, to, visit, the, area, formal, competitions, began, down, the, natural, ice, cresta, run, in, 1884, which, was, built, in, an, annual, partnership, between, guests, and, local, people, the, run, which, was, still, in, operation, as, of, 2014, has, served, as, a, host, track, for, skeleton, at, two, winter, olympic, games, 1928, and, 1948, as, one, of, the, few, natural, weather, tracks, in, the, world, it, does, not, use, artificial, refrigeration, it, is, not, known, how, much, the, original, track, evolved, in, the, early, years, as, the, three, sports, matured, and, stabilized, the, first, club, was, formed, in, 1897, and, the, first, purpose, built, track, solely, for, bobsleds, opened, in, 1902, outside, st, moritz, over, the, years, bobsleigh, tracks, evolved, from, straight, runs, to, twisting, and, turning, tracks, the, original, wooden, sleds, gave, way, to, streamlined, fiberglass, and, metal, ones, the, international, bobsleigh, and, skeleton, federation, ibsf, was, founded, in, 1923, men, s, four, man, bobsleigh, appeared, in, the, first, ever, winter, olympics, in, 1924, and, the, men, s, two, man, bobsleigh, event, was, added, in, 1932, though, not, included, in, the, 1960, winter, olympics, bobsleigh, has, featured, in, every, winter, olympics, since, women, s, bobsleigh, competition, began, in, the, us, in, 1983, with, two, demonstration, races, in, lake, placid, new, york, one, held, in, february, and, the, second, held, during, the, world, cup, races, in, march, 1983, two, woman, bobsleigh, made, its, olympic, debut, at, the, 2002, winter, olympics, bobsleigh, is, also, contested, at, american, european, and, world, cup, championships, germany, and, switzerland, have, proven, the, most, successful, bobsleighing, nations, measured, by, overall, success, in, european, world, world, cup, and, olympic, championships, since, the, 1990s, germans, have, dominated, in, international, competition, having, won, more, medals, than, any, other, nation, italy, austria, canada, and, the, united, states, also, have, strong, bobsleigh, traditions, bobsleighs, can, attain, speeds, of, 150, km, h, 93, mph, with, the, reported, world, record, being, 157, 06, km, h, 97, 59, mph, set, on, march, 3, 2019, at, the, whistler, world, championships, in, 2019, modern, tracks, are, made, of, concrete, coated, with, ice, they, are, required, to, have, at, least, one, straight, section, and, one, labyrinth, three, turns, in, quick, succession, without, a, straight, section, ideally, a, modern, track, should, be, 1, 200, to, 1, 300, metres, 3, 900, 4, 300, ft, long, and, have, at, least, fifteen, curves, speeds, may, exceed, 120, kilometres, per, hour, 75, mph, and, some, curves, can, subject, the, crews, to, as, much, as, 5, g, some, bobsleigh, tracks, are, also, used, for, luge, and, skeleton, competition, some, tracks, offer, tourists, rides, in, bobsleighs, including, those, at, sigulda, latvia, innsbruck, igls, austria, whistler, british, columbia, canada, lillehammer, norway, cesana, pariol, italy, lake, placid, us, salt, lake, city, utah, us, and, la, plagne, france, modern, day, sleighs, combine, light, metals, steel, runners, and, an, aerodynamic, composite, body, competition, sleighs, must, be, a, maximum, of, 3, 80, metres, 12, 5, ft, long, 4, crew, or, 2, 70, metres, 8, 9, ft, long, 2, crew, the, runners, on, both, are, set, at, 0, 67, metres, 2, 2, ft, gauge, until, the, weight, limit, rule, was, added, in, 1952, bobsleigh, crews, tended, to, be, very, heavy, to, ensure, the, greatest, possible, speed, nowadays, the, maximum, weight, including, crew, is, 630, kilograms, 1, 390, lb, 4, man, 390, kilograms, 860, lb, 2, man, or, 340, kilograms, 750, lb, 2, woman, which, can, be, reached, via, the, addition, of, metal, weights, the, bobsleighs, themselves, are, designed, to, be, as, light, as, possible, to, allow, dynamic, positioning, of, mass, through, the, turns, of, the, bobsleigh, course, although, bobsleighs, once, were, ridden, by, five, or, six, crews, were, reduced, in, the, 1930s, to, either, two, or, four, people, the, four, person, crew, consists, of, a, pilot, a, brakeman, and, two, pushers, athletes, are, selected, for, their, speed, and, strength, which, are, necessary, to, push, the, sleigh, to, a, competitive, speed, at, the, start, of, the, race, pilots, must, have, the, skill, timing, and, finesse, to, steer, the, sleigh, along, the, path, or, line, that, will, produce, the, greatest, speed, in, modern, bobsleighs, the, steering, system, consists, of, two, metal, rings, that, actuate, a, pulley, system, located, in, the, forward, cowling, that, turns, the, front, runners, for, example, to, turn, left, the, pilot, would, pull, the, left, ring, only, subtle, steering, adjustments, are, necessary, to, guide, the, sled, at, speeds, up, to, 80, miles, per, hour, 130, km, h, anything, larger, would, result, in, a, crash, the, pilot, does, most, of, the, steering, and, the, brakeman, stops, the, sled, after, crossing, the, finish, line, by, pulling, the, sled, s, brake, lever, women, compete, in, women, s, bobsleigh, which, is, always, two, woman, and, men, in, both, two, and, four, man, competitions, women, were, confirmed, as, being, able, to, compete, in, any, four, man, bobsleigh, event, as, from, 25, september, 2014, either, as, part, of, a, mixed, sex, team, or, an, all, female, team, however, because, women, are, on, average, lighter, than, men, and, thus, at, a, competitive, disadvantage, in, a, gravity, sport, and, because, most, sliding, nations, have, fewer, women, able, to, compete, than, men, this, option, has, not, proved, popular, with, teams, a, single, person, bobsleigh, is, called, a, monobob, single, person, sleds, were, introduced, into, international, competition, for, both, adaptive, bobsleigh, for, athletes, who, are, able, to, drive, a, sled, but, not, push, and, as, a, youth, sport, for, younger, athletes, who, have, not, yet, developed, the, ability, to, push, a, heavy, two, or, four, person, sled, after, the, 2018, winter, olympics, the, international, olympic, committee, and, the, ibsf, agreed, to, add, women, s, monobob, as, an, olympic, sport, for, the, 2022, winter, olympics, so, that, there, would, be, an, equal, number, of, women, s, and, men, s, events, in, bobsleigh, prior, to, the, 2020, 21, competitive, season, monobobs, were, traditionally, constructed, on, one, piece, chassis, starting, with, the, 2020, 21, season, competitors, in, ibsf, sanctioned, races, must, use, articulated, two, section, monobobs, manufactured, by, the, ibsf, s, sole, source, sled, builder, ixent, the, sled, must, weigh, a, minimum, of, 162, kg, 357, lb, without, the, athlete, but, including, timing, equipment, and, any, ballast, weights, and, a, maximum, of, 247, kg, 545, lb, including, the, athlete, runners, are, the, same, as, for, two, person, bobsleighs, this, implies, a, maximum, athlete, weight, limit, of, 85, kg, 187, lb, individual, runs, down, the, course, or, heats, begin, from, a, standing, start, with, the, crew, pushing, the, sled, for, up, to, 50, metres, 160, ft, before, boarding, though, the, pilot, does, not, steer, grooves, in, the, ice, make, steering, unnecessary, until, the, sled, leaves, the, starting, area, while, poor, form, during, the, initial, push, can, lose, a, team, the, heat, it, is, otherwise, rarely, if, ever, decisive, over, the, rest, of, the, course, a, sleigh, s, speed, depends, on, its, weight, aerodynamics, runners, the, condition, of, the, ice, and, the, skill, of, the, pilot, race, times, are, recorded, in, hundredths, of, seconds, so, even, seemingly, minor, errors, especially, those, at, the, beginning, which, affect, the, remainder, of, the, heat, can, have, a, measurable, impact, on, the, final, race, standings, the, men, s, and, women, s, standings, for, normal, races, are, calculated, over, the, aggregate, of, two, runs, or, heats, at, the, olympic, winter, games, and, world, championships, all, competitions, for, both, men, and, women, consist, of, four, heats, sledding, at, a, competitive, level, involves, sledders, repeatedly, subjecting, themselves, to, high, g, forces, and, multiple, small, collisions, of, their, head, into, their, helmet, as, sharp, turns, are, taken, additionally, when, mistakes, happen, and, the, sled, crashes, there, are, no, seatbelts, or, other, protections, the, sledders, can, simply, be, falling, down, the, course, at, high, speed, with, their, helmet, grinding, along, the, surface, or, bouncing, off, the, interior, of, the, sled, one, sledder, described, his, experience, during, crashes, as, being, equivalent, to, his, head, being, inside, a, jet, engine, even, ignoring, crashes, repetitive, shaking, from, small, imperfections, in, the, course, is, hypothesized, to, cause, small, tears, in, the, brain, especially, if, performed, repeatedly, the, culture, of, competitive, bobsledders, especially, before, this, danger, was, recognized, also, made, injured, participants, hesitant, to, speak, up, and, request, breaks, fearful, of, being, dropped, from, the, team, bobsledders, who, train, frequently, have, reported, issues, such, as, chronic, headaches, a, heightened, sensitivity, to, bright, lights, and, loud, noises, forgetfulness, a, mental, fog, and, psychological, problems, repeated, mild, brain, trauma, has, caused, issues, for, boxers, rugby, players, and, football, players, with, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, and, fears, have, arisen, that, bobsledding, carries, a, similar, danger, at, least, with, the, steeper, and, faster, courses, used, in, competitions, a, brain, scan, of, one, bobsledder, christina, smith, revealed, damage, to, the, rear, and, frontal, lobes, consistent, with, micro, tears, in, the, brain, s, white, matter, a, significant, number, of, athletes, have, either, died, by, suicide, or, died, of, drug, overdoses, examples, include, medal, winning, bobsledders, eugenio, monti, and, pavle, jovanovic, who, died, by, suicide, steven, holcomb, died, of, an, overdose, since, 2013, three, north, american, former, bobsledders, have, taken, their, lives, another, attempted, it, and, two, others, died, of, overdoses, this, is, far, over, expectation, of, the, group, from, chance, as, only, a, few, hundred, athletes, participate, seriously, in, bobsled, and, other, sliding, sports, such, as, luge, and, skeleton, at, any, one, time
