directly, above, a, line, marked, on, the, ground, and, once, the, contest, the, pull, has, commenced, attempt, to, pull, the, other, team, such, that, the, marking, on, the, rope, closest, to, their,

for, extended, periods, of, time, the, rope, must, go, under, the, arms, actions, such, as, pulling, the, rope, over, the, shoulders, may, be, considered, a, foul, these, rules, apply, in, highly, organized, competitions, such, as, the, world, championships, however, in, small, or, informal, entertainment, competitions, the, rules, are, often, arbitrarily, interpreted, and, followed, a, contest, may, feature, a, moat, in, a, neutral, zone, usually, of, mud, or, softened, ground, which, eliminates, players, who, cross, the, zone, or, fall, into, it, aside, from, the, raw, muscle, power, needed, for, tug, of, war, it, is, also, a, technical, sport, the, cooperation, or, rhythm, of, team, members, is, just, as, important, as, physical, strength, to, achieve, this, a, person, called, a, driver, is, used, to, harmonize, the, team, s, joint, traction, power, the, driver, moves, up, and, down, next, to, their, team, pulling, on, the, rope, giving, orders, to, them, when, to, pull, and, when, to, rest, called, hanging, if, the, driver, spots, the, opposing, team, trying, to, pull, the, driver, s, team, away, the, driver, gives, a, hang, command, each, member, will, dig, into, the, grass, with, their, boots, and, movement, of, the, rope, is, limited, when, the, opponents, are, played, out, the, driver, shouts, pull, and, rhythmically, waves, their, hat, or, handkerchief, for, their, team, to, pull, together, slowly, but, surely, the, other, team, is, forced, into, surrender, by, a, runaway, pull, another, factor, that, affects, the, game, is, the, players, weights, the, heavier, someone, is, the, more, static, friction, their, feet, have, to, the, ground, but, if, there, is, not, enough, friction, and, they, weigh, too, little, even, if, they, are, pulling, extremely, hard, the, force, will, not, be, transmitted, to, the, rope, their, feet, will, simply, slide, along, the, ground, if, their, opponent, s, have, better, static, friction, with, the, ground, in, general, as, long, as, one, team, has, enough, static, friction, and, can, pull, hard, enough, to, overcome, the, static, friction, of, their, opponent, s, that, team, can, easily, win, the, match, in, addition, to, injuries, from, falling, and, from, back, strains, some, of, which, may, be, serious, catastrophic, injuries, may, occur, as, a, result, of, looping, or, wrapping, the, rope, around, a, hand, or, wrist, or, impact, from, snapback, if, the, rope, should, break, this, may, cause, permanent, damage, to, the, body, requiring, finger, hand, or, even, arm, amputations, amateur, organizers, of, tugs, of, war, may, underestimate, the, forces, generated, and, thus, may, be, unaware, of, the, possible, consequences, if, a, rope, snaps, under, extreme, tension, injury, is, primarily, due, to, the, large, amount, of, potential, energy, stored, in, the, rope, during, the, competition, as, both, sides, pull, tension, is, placed, on, the, rope, causing, it, to, stretch, as, described, by, hooke, s, law, if, a, rope, exceeds, its, breaking, point, the, potential, energy, is, suddenly, converted, to, kinetic, energy, and, the, broken, ends, of, the, rope, will, snapback, at, great, speed, which, can, cause, serious, injuries, this, phenomenon, has, been, studied, in, ship, operations, as, mooring, ropes, pose, the, same, risk, should, they, snap, for, this, reason, specially, engineered, tug, of, war, ropes, exist, that, can, safely, withstand, the, forces, generated
