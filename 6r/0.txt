restricted, to, human, beings, and, is, a, feature, of, all, human, societies, the, amount, and, type, of, clothing, worn, depends, on, gender, body, type, social, factors, and, geographic, considerations, garments, cover, the, body, footwear, covers, the, feet, gloves, cover, the, hands, while, hats, and, headgear, cover, the, head, and, underwear, covers, the, private, parts, clothing,

and, the, environment, clothing, can, insulate, against, cold, or, hot, conditions, and, it, can, provide, a, hygienic, barrier, keeping, infectious, and, toxic, materials, away, from, the, body, it, can, protect, feet, from, injury, and, discomfort, or, facilitate, navigation, in, varied, environments, clothing, also, provides, protection, from, ultraviolet, radiation, it, may, be, used, to, prevent, glare, or, increase, visual, acuity, in, harsh, environments, such, as, brimmed, hats, clothing, is, used, for, protection, against, injury, in, specific, tasks, and, occupations, sports, and, warfare, fashioned, with, pockets, belts, or, loops, clothing, may, provide, a, means, to, carry, things, while, freeing, the, hands, clothing, has, significant, social, factors, as, well, wearing, clothes, is, a, variable, social, norm, it, may, connote, modesty, being, deprived, of, clothing, in, front, of, others, may, be, embarrassing, in, many, parts, of, the, world, not, wearing, clothes, in, public, so, that, genitals, breast, or, buttocks, are, visible, could, be, considered, indecent, exposure, pubic, area, or, genital, coverage, is, the, most, frequently, encountered, minimum, found, cross, culturally, and, regardless, of, climate, implying, social, convention, as, the, basis, of, customs, clothing, also, may, be, used, to, communicate, social, status, wealth, group, identity, and, individualism, some, forms, of, personal, protective, equipment, amount, to, clothing, such, as, coveralls, chaps, or, a, doctor, s, white, coat, with, similar, requirements, for, maintenance, and, cleaning, as, other, textiles, boxing, gloves, function, both, as, protective, equipment, and, as, a, sparring, weapon, so, the, equipment, aspect, rises, above, the, glove, aspect, more, specialized, forms, of, protective, equipment, such, as, face, shields, are, classified, as, protective, accessories, at, the, far, extreme, self, enclosing, diving, suits, or, space, suits, are, form, fitting, body, covers, and, amount, to, a, form, of, dress, without, being, clothing, per, se, while, containing, enough, high, technology, to, amount, to, more, of, a, tool, than, a, garment, this, line, will, continue, to, blur, as, wearable, technology, embeds, assistive, devices, directly, into, the, fabric, itself, the, enabling, innovations, are, ultra, low, power, consumption, and, flexible, electronic, substrates, clothing, also, hybridizes, into, a, personal, transportation, system, ice, skates, roller, skates, cargo, pants, other, outdoor, survival, gear, one, man, band, or, concealment, system, stage, magicians, hidden, linings, or, pockets, in, tradecraft, integrated, holsters, for, concealed, carry, merchandise, laden, trench, coats, on, the, black, market, where, the, purpose, of, the, clothing, often, carries, over, into, disguise, a, mode, of, dress, fit, to, purpose, whether, stylistic, or, functional, is, known, as, an, outfit, or, ensemble, estimates, of, when, humans, began, wearing, clothes, vary, from, 40, 000, to, as, many, as, 3, million, years, ago, but, recent, studies, suggest, humans, were, wearing, clothing, at, least, 100, 000, years, ago, recent, studies, by, ralf, kittler, manfred, kayser, and, mark, stoneking, anthropologists, at, the, max, planck, institute, for, evolutionary, anthropology, have, attempted, to, constrain, the, most, recent, date, of, the, introduction, of, clothing, with, an, indirect, method, relying, on, lice, the, rationale, for, this, method, of, dating, stems, from, the, fact, that, the, human, body, louse, cannot, live, outside, of, clothing, dying, after, only, a, few, hours, without, shelter, this, strongly, implies, that, the, date, of, the, body, louse, s, speciation, from, its, parent, pediculus, humanus, can, have, taken, place, no, earlier, than, the, earliest, human, adoption, of, clothing, this, date, at, which, the, body, louse, p, humanus, corporis, diverged, from, both, its, parent, species, and, its, sibling, subspecies, the, head, louse, p, humanus, capitis, can, be, determined, by, the, number, of, mutations, each, has, developed, during, the, intervening, time, such, mutations, occur, at, a, known, rate, and, the, date, of, last, common, ancestor, for, two, species, can, therefore, be, estimated, from, their, frequency, these, studies, have, produced, dates, from, 40, 000, to, 170, 000, years, ago, with, a, greatest, likelihood, of, speciation, lying, at, about, 107, 000, years, ago, kittler, kayser, and, stoneking, suggest, that, the, invention, of, clothing, may, have, coincided, with, the, northward, migration, of, modern, homo, sapiens, away, from, the, warm, climate, of, africa, which, is, thought, to, have, begun, between, 100, 000, and, 50, 000, years, ago, a, second, group, of, researchers, also, relying, on, the, genetic, clock, estimate, that, clothing, originated, between, 30, 000, and, 114, 000, years, ago, dating, with, direct, archeological, evidence, produces, dates, consistent, with, those, of, lice, in, september, 2021, scientists, reported, evidence, of, clothes, being, made, 120, 000, years, ago, based, on, findings, in, deposits, in, morocco, the, development, of, clothing, is, deeply, connected, to, human, evolution, with, early, garments, likely, consisting, of, animal, skins, and, natural, fibers, adapted, for, protection, and, social, signaling, according, to, anthropologists, and, archaeologists, the, earliest, clothing, likely, consisted, of, fur, leather, leaves, or, grass, that, was, draped, wrapped, or, tied, around, the, body, knowledge, of, such, clothing, remains, inferential, as, clothing, materials, deteriorate, quickly, compared, with, stone, bone, shell, and, metal, artifacts, archeologists, have, identified, very, early, sewing, needles, of, bone, and, ivory, from, about, 30, 000, bc, found, near, kostenki, russia, in, 1988, and, in, 2016, a, needle, at, least, 50, 000, years, old, from, denisova, cave, in, siberia, made, by, denisovans, dyed, flax, fibers, that, date, back, to, 34, 000, bc, and, could, have, been, used, in, clothing, have, been, found, in, a, prehistoric, cave, in, georgia, several, distinct, human, cultures, including, those, residing, in, the, arctic, circle, have, historically, crafted, their, garments, exclusively, from, treated, and, adorned, animal, furs, and, skins, in, contrast, numerous, other, societies, have, complemented, or, substituted, leather, and, skins, with, textiles, woven, knitted, or, twined, from, a, diverse, array, of, animal, and, plant, fibers, such, as, wool, linen, cotton, silk, hemp, and, ramie, although, modern, consumers, may, take, the, production, of, clothing, for, granted, making, fabric, by, hand, is, a, tedious, and, labor, intensive, process, involving, fiber, making, spinning, and, weaving, the, textile, industry, was, the, first, to, be, mechanized, with, the, powered, loom, during, the, industrial, revolution, different, cultures, have, evolved, various, ways, of, creating, clothes, out, of, cloth, one, approach, involves, draping, the, cloth, many, people, wore, and, still, wear, garments, consisting, of, rectangles, of, cloth, wrapped, to, fit, for, example, the, dhoti, for, men, and, the, sari, for, women, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, scottish, kilt, and, the, javanese, sarong, the, clothes, may, be, tied, up, dhoti, and, sari, or, implement, pins, or, belts, to, hold, the, garments, in, place, kilt, and, sarong, the, cloth, remains, uncut, and, people, of, various, sizes, can, wear, the, garment, another, approach, involves, measuring, cutting, and, sewing, the, cloth, by, hand, or, with, a, sewing, machine, clothing, can, be, cut, from, a, sewing, pattern, and, adjusted, by, a, tailor, to, the, wearer, s, measurements, an, adjustable, sewing, mannequin, or, dress, form, is, used, to, create, form, fitting, clothing, if, the, fabric, is, expensive, the, tailor, tries, to, use, every, bit, of, the, cloth, rectangle, in, constructing, the, clothing, perhaps, cutting, triangular, pieces, from, one, corner, of, the, cloth, and, adding, them, elsewhere, as, gussets, traditional, european, patterns, for, shirts, and, chemises, take, this, approach, these, remnants, can, also, be, reused, to, make, patchwork, pockets, hats, vests, and, skirts, modern, european, fashion, treats, cloth, much, less, conservatively, typically, cutting, in, such, a, way, as, to, leave, various, odd, shaped, cloth, remnants, industrial, sewing, operations, sell, these, as, waste, domestic, sewers, may, turn, them, into, quilts, in, the, thousands, of, years, that, humans, have, been, making, clothing, they, have, created, an, astonishing, array, of, styles, many, of, which, have, been, reconstructed, from, surviving, garments, photographs, paintings, mosaics, etc, as, well, as, from, written, descriptions, costume, history, can, inspire, current, fashion, designers, as, well, as, costumiers, for, plays, films, television, and, historical, reenactment, comfort, is, related, to, various, perceptions, physiological, social, and, psychological, needs, and, after, food, it, is, clothing, that, satisfies, these, comfort, needs, clothing, provides, aesthetic, tactile, thermal, moisture, and, pressure, comfort, the, most, obvious, function, of, clothing, is, to, protect, the, wearer, from, the, elements, it, serves, to, prevent, wind, damage, and, provides, protection, from, sunburn, in, the, cold, it, offers, thermal, insulation, shelter, can, reduce, the, functional, need, for, clothing, for, example, coats, hats, gloves, and, other, outer, layers, are, normally, removed, when, entering, a, warm, place, similarly, clothing, has, seasonal, and, regional, aspects, so, that, thinner, materials, and, fewer, layers, of, clothing, generally, are, worn, in, warmer, regions, and, seasons, than, in, colder, ones, boots, hats, jackets, ponchos, and, coats, designed, to, protect, from, rain, and, snow, are, specialized, clothing, items, clothing, has, been, made, from, a, wide, variety, of, materials, ranging, from, leather, and, furs, to, woven, fabrics, to, elaborate, and, exotic, natural, and, synthetic, fabrics, not, all, body, coverings, are, regarded, as, clothing, articles, carried, rather, than, worn, normally, are, considered, accessories, rather, than, clothing, such, as, handbags, items, worn, on, a, single, part, of, the, body, and, easily, removed, scarves, worn, purely, for, adornment, jewelry, or, items, that, do, not, serve, a, protective, function, for, instance, corrective, eyeglasses, arctic, goggles, and, sunglasses, would, not, be, considered, an, accessory, because, of, their, protective, functions, clothing, protects, against, many, things, that, might, injure, or, irritate, the, naked, human, body, including, rain, snow, wind, and, other, weather, as, well, as, from, the, sun, garments, that, are, too, sheer, thin, small, or, tight, offer, less, protection, appropriate, clothes, can, also, reduce, risk, during, activities, such, as, work, or, sport, some, clothing, protects, from, specific, hazards, such, as, insects, toxic, chemicals, weather, weapons, and, contact, with, abrasive, substances, humans, have, devised, clothing, solutions, to, environmental, or, other, hazards, such, as, space, suits, armor, diving, suits, swimsuits, bee, keeper, gear, motorcycle, leathers, high, visibility, clothing, and, other, pieces, of, protective, clothing, the, distinction, between, clothing, and, protective, equipment, is, not, always, clear, cut, since, clothes, designed, to, be, fashionable, often, have, protective, value, and, clothes, designed, for, function, often, have, corporate, fashion, in, their, design, the, choice, of, clothes, also, has, social, implications, they, cover, parts, of, the, body, that, social, norms, require, to, be, covered, act, as, a, form, of, adornment, and, serve, other, social, purposes, someone, who, lacks, the, means, to, procure, appropriate, clothing, due, to, poverty, or, affordability, or, lack, of, inclination, sometimes, is, said, to, be, worn, ragged, or, shabby, clothing, performs, a, range, of, social, and, cultural, functions, such, as, individual, occupational, gender, differentiation, and, social, status, in, many, societies, norms, about, clothing, reflect, standards, of, modesty, religion, gender, and, social, status, clothing, may, also, function, as, adornment,

environments, such, as, tropical, ones, in, asia, some, scientific, research, into, the, multiple, functions, of, clothing, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, with, publications, such, as, j, c, fl, gel, s, psychology, of, clothes, in, 1930, and, newburgh, s, seminal, physiology, of, heat, regulation, and, the, science, of, clothing, in, 1949, by, 1968, the, field, of, environmental, physiology, had, advanced, and, expanded, significantly, but, the, science, of, clothing, in, relation, to, environmental, physiology, had, changed, little, there, has, since, been, considerable, research, and, the, knowledge, base, has, grown, significantly, but, the, main, concepts, remain, unchanged, and, indeed, newburgh, s, book, continues, to, be, cited, by, contemporary, authors, including, those, attempting, to, develop, thermoregulatory, models, of, clothing, development, clothing, reveals, much, about, human, history, according, to, professor, kiki, smith, of, smith, college, garments, preserved, in, collections, are, resources, for, study, similar, to, books, and, paintings, scholars, around, the, world, have, studied, a, wide, range, of, clothing, topics,

manual, labor, often, mass, produced, clothing, is, made, in, what, are, considered, by, some, to, be, sweatshops, typified, by, long, work, hours, lack, of, benefits, and, lack, of, worker, representation, while, most, examples, of, such, conditions, are, found, in, developing, countries, clothes, made, in, industrialized, nations, may, also, be, manufactured, under, similar, conditions, coalitions, of, ngos, designers, including, katharine, hamnett, american, apparel, veja, quiksilver, evocal, and, edun, and, campaign, groups, such, as, the, clean, clothes, campaign, ccc, and, the,
