ambrosian, republic, to, finance, the, war, against, the, republic, of, venice, however, it, was, in, genoa, that, lotto, became, very, popular, people, used, to, bet, on, the, name, of, great, council, members, who, were, drawn, by, chance, five, out, of, ninety, candidates, every, six, months, this, kind, of, gambling, was, called, lotto, or, semenaiu, when, people, wanted, to, bet, more, frequently, than, twice, a, year, they, began, to, substitute, the, candidates, names, with, numbers, and, modern, lotto, was, born, to, which, both, modern, legal, lotteries, and, the, illegal, numbers, game, can, trace, their, ancestry, king, francis, i, of, france, discovered, the, lotteries, during, his, campaigns, in, italy, and, decided, to, organize, such, a, lottery, in, his, kingdom, to, help, the, state, finances, the, first, french, lottery, the, loterie, royale, was, held, in, 1539, and, was, authorized, with, the, edict, of, ch, teaurenard, this, attempt, was, a, fiasco, since, the, tickets, were, very, costly, and, the, social, classes, which, could, afford, them, opposed, the, project, between, 1757, and, 1836, for, a, period, of, about, 80, years, with, some, interruption, during, the, french, revolution, the, french, state, ran, a, profitable, loterie, the, project, was, born, out, a, series, of, initiatives, to, fund, the, cole, militaire, instrumental, to, the, birth, of, the, loterie, were, giacomo, casanova, and, the, calzabigi, brothers, giovanni, and, ranieri, casanova, defended, the, project, in, a, series, of, conversations, with, madame, de, pompadour, the, french, mathematician, jean, d, alembert, joseph, de, p, ris, duverney, intendent, of, the, cole, and, the, french, minister, of, foreign, affair, unlike, modern, lotteries, where, the, state, can, never, lose, in, the, french, lottery, the, state, could, lose, but, a, wise, choice, of, the, payoff, made, losses, so, improbable, as, to, ensure, a, profit, for, the, state, although, the, english, probably, first, experimented, with, raffles, and, similar, games, of, chance, the, first, recorded, official, lottery, was, chartered, by, queen, elizabeth, i, in, the, year, 1566, and, was, drawn, in, 1569, the, 400, 000, tickets, issued, cost, 10, shillings, 0, 50, each, roughly, three, weeks, of, wages, for, ordinary, citizens, with, the, grand, prize, worth, roughly, 5, 000, this, lottery, was, designed, to, raise, money, for, the, reparation, of, the, havens, and, strength, of, the, realme, and, towardes, such, other, publique, good, workes, including, the, rebuilding, of, ports, and, new, ships, for, the, royal, fleet, each, ticket, holder, won, a, prize, and, the, total, value, of, the, prizes, equalled, the, money, raised, prizes, were, in, the, form, of, both, ready, money, and, valuable, commodities, such, as, silver, plate, tapestries, and, fine, linen, cloth, additionally, each, participant, was, granted, immunity, from, one, arrest, so, long, as, the, crime, wasn, t, piracy, murder, felonies, or, treason, the, lottery, was, promoted, by, scrolls, posted, throughout, the, country, showing, sketches, of, the, prizes, thus, the, lottery, money, received, was, an, interest, free, loan, to, the, government, during, the, three, years, that, the, tickets, without, any, blankes, were, sold, in, later, years, the, government, sold, the, lottery, ticket, rights, to, brokers, who, in, turn, hired, agents, and, runners, to, sell, them, these, brokers, eventually, became, the, modern, day, stockbrokers, for, various, commercial, ventures, most, people, could, not, afford, the, entire, cost, of, a, lottery, ticket, so, the, brokers, would, sell, shares, in, a, ticket, this, resulted, in, tickets, being, issued, with, a, notation, such, as, sixteenth, or, third, class, many, private, lotteries, were, held, including, raising, money, for, the, virginia, company, of, london, to, support, its, settlement, in, america, at, jamestown, the, english, state, lottery, ran, from, 1694, until, 1826, thus, the, english, lotteries, ran, for, over, 250, years, until, the, government, under, constant, pressure, from, the, opposition, in, parliament, declared, a, final, lottery, in, 1826, this, lottery, was, held, up, to, ridicule, by, contemporary, commentators, as, the, last, struggle, of, the, speculators, on, public, credulity, for, popularity, to, their, last, dying, lottery, an, english, lottery, authorized, by, king, james, i, in, 1612, granted, the, virginia, company, of, london, the, right, to, raise, money, to, help, establish, settlers, in, the, first, permanent, english, colony, at, jamestown, virginia, lotteries, in, colonial, america, played, a, significant, part, in, the, financing, of, both,

lottery, tickets, anyway, either, because, they, do, not, understand, the, mathematics, or, because, they, find, the, thrill, and, fantasy, of, becoming, wealthy, to, be, worthwhile, if, this, entertainment, value, and, any, other, non, monetary, value, is, factored, into, the, utility, function, a, lottery, ticket, purchase, can, be, considered, rational, according, to, expected, utility, maximization, the, chances, of, winning, a, lottery, jackpot, can, vary, widely, depending, on, the, lottery, design, and, are, determined, by, several, factors, including, the, count, of, possible,

fewer, matches, although, none, of, these, additional, prizes, affect, the, chances, of, winning, the, jackpot, they, do, improve, the, odds, of, winning, something, and, therefore, add, a, little,

involves, the, selling, of, systems, which, purport, to, improve, a, player, s, chances, of, selecting, the, winning, numbers, in, a, lotto, game, these, scams, are, generally, based, on, the, buyer, s, and, perhaps, the, seller, s, misunderstanding, of, probability, and, random, numbers, sale, of, these, systems, or, software, is, legal, however, since, they, mention, that, the, product, cannot,

to, determine, one, or, both, in, cases, where, there, is, no, visible, or, audible, cue, to, the, patron, of, the, outcome, of, the, scan, some, cashiers, have, taken, the, opportunity, to, claim, that, the, ticket, is, a, loser, or, that, it, is, worth, far, less, than, it, is, and, offer, to, throw, it, away, or, surreptitiously, substitute, it, for, another, ticket, the, cashier, then, pockets, the, ticket, and, eventually, claims, it, as, their, own, the, bbc, tv, series, the, real, hustle, showed, a, variation, of, the, lottery, scam, in, which, a, group, of, scammers, pretended,
