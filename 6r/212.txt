a, shower, is, a, place, in, which, a, person, bathes, under, a, spray, of, typically, warm, or, hot, water, indoors, there, is, a, drain, in, the, floor, most, showers, have, temperature, spray, pressure, and, adjustable, showerhead, nozzle, the, simplest, showers, have, a, swivelling, nozzle, aiming, down, on, the, user, while, more, complex, showers, have, a, showerhead, connected, to, a, hose, that, has, a, mounting, bracket, this, allows, the, showerer, to, hold, the, showerhead, by, hand, to, spray, the, water, onto, different, parts, of, their, body, a, shower, can, be, installed, in, a, small, shower, stall, or, bathtub, with, a, plastic, shower, curtain, or, door, showering, is, common, due, to, the, efficiency, of, using, it, compared, with, a, bathtub, its, use, in, hygiene, is, therefore, common, practice, the, original, showers, were, neither, indoor, structures, nor, human, made, but, were, common, natural, formations, waterfalls, the, falling, water, rinsed, the, bathers, completely, clean, and, was, more, efficient, than, bathing, in, a, traditional, basin, which, required, manual, transport, of, both, fresh, and, waste, water, ancient, people, began, to, reproduce, these, natural, phenomena, by, pouring, jugs, of, water, often, very, cold, over, themselves, after, washing, there, has, been, evidence, of, early, upper, class, egyptian, and, mesopotamians, having, indoor, shower, rooms, where, servants, would, bathe, them, in, the, privacy, of, their, own, homes, however, these, were, primitive, by, modern, standards, having, rudimentary, drainage, systems, and, water, was, carried, not, pumped, into, the, room, the, ancient, greeks, were, the, first, people, to, have, showers, their, aqueducts, and, sewage, systems, made, of, lead, pipes, allowed, water, to, be, pumped, both, into, and, out, of, large, communal, shower, rooms, used, by, elites, and, common, citizens, alike, these, rooms, have, been, discovered, at, the, site, of, the, city, pergamum, and, can, also, be, found, represented, in, pottery, of, the, era, the, depictions, are, very, similar, to, modern, locker, room, showers, and, even, included, bars, to, hang, up, clothing, the, ancient, romans, also, followed, this, convention, their, famous, bathhouses, thermae, can, be, found, all, around, the, mediterranean, and, as, far, out, as, modern, day, england, the, romans, not, only, had, these, showers, but, also, believed, in, bathing, multiple, times, a, week, if, not, every, day, the, water, and, sewage, systems, developed, by, the, greeks, and, romans, broke, down, and, fell, out, of, use, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, first, known, mechanical, shower, operated, by, a, hand, pump, was, patented, in, england, in, 1767, by, william, feetham, a, stove, maker, from, ludgate, hill, in, london, his, shower, contraption, used, a, pump, to, force, the, water, into, a, vessel, above, the, user, s, head, and, a, chain, would, then, be, pulled, to, release, the, water, from, the, vessel, although, the, system, dispensed, with, the, servant, labour, of, filling, up, and, pouring, out, buckets, of, water, the, showers, failed, to, catch, on, with, the, rich, as, a, method, for, piping, hot, water, through, the, system, was, not, available, the, system, would, also, recycle, the, same, dirty, water, through, every, cycle, this, early, start, was, greatly, improved, in, the, anonymously, invented, english, regency, shower, design, of, c, 1810, there, is, some, ambiguity, among, the, sources, the, original, design, was, over, 10, feet, 3, m, tall, and, was, made, of, several, metal, pipes, painted, to, look, like, bamboo, a, basin, suspended, above, the, pipes, fed, water, into, a, nozzle, that, distributed, the, water, over, the, user, s, shoulders, the, water, on, the, ground, was, drained, and, pumped, back, through, the, pipes, into, the, basin, where, the, cycle, would, repeat, itself, the, original, prototype, was, steadily, improved, upon, in, the, following, decades, until, it, began, to, approximate, the, shower, of, today, in, its, mode, of, operation, hand, pumped, models, became, fashionable, at, one, point, as, well, as, the, use, of, adjustable, sprayers, for, different, water, flow, the, reinvention, of, reliable, indoor, plumbing, around, 1850, allowed, free, standing, showers, to, be, connected, to, a, running, water, source, supplying, a, renewable, flow, of, water, the, shower, cabin, was, invented, in, 1839, by, polish, canadian, politician, and, engineer, aleksander, edward, kierzkowski, modern, showers, were, installed, in, the, barracks, of, the, french, army, in, the, 1870s, as, an, economic, hygiene, measure, under, the, guidance, of, fran, ois, merry, delabost, a, french, doctor, and, inventor, as, surgeon, general, at, bonne, nouvelle, prison, in, rouen, delabost, had, previously, replaced, individual, baths, with, mandatory, communal, showers, for, use, by, prisoners, arguing, that, they, were, more, economical, and, hygienic, first, six, then, eight, shower, stalls, were, installed, the, water, was, heated, by, a, steam, engine, and, in, less, than, five, minutes, up, to, eight, prisoners, could, wash, simultaneously, with, only, twenty, litres, of, water, the, french, system, of, communal, showers, was, adopted, by, other, armies, the, first, being, that, of, prussia, in, 1879, and, by, prisons, in, other, jurisdictions, they, were, also, adopted, by, boarding, schools, before, being, installed, in, public, bathhouses, the, first, shower, in, a, public, bathhouse, was, in, 1887, in, vienna, in, france, public, bathhouses, and, showers, were, established, by, charles, cazalet, firstly, in, bordeaux, in, 1893, and, then, in, paris, in, 1899, domestic, showers, are, most, commonly, stall, showers, or, showers, combined, with, a, bathtub, a, stall, shower, is, a, dedicated, shower, area, which, uses, a, door, or, curtain, to, contain, water, spray, the, shower, tub, format, saves, bathroom, space, and, enables, the, area, to, be, used, for, either, a, bath, or, a, shower, and, commonly, uses, a, sliding, shower, curtain, or, door, to, contain, the, water, spray, showers, may, also, be, in, a, wet, room, in, which, there, is, no, contained, shower, area, or, in, a, dedicated, shower, room, which, does, not, require, containment, of, water, spray, domestic, showers, can, have, a, single, shower, head, multiple, shower, heads, handheld, shower, head, s, or, other, variations, all, which, may, be, adjustable, as, needed, to, varying, degrees, many, modern, athletic, and, aquatic, facilities, provide, showers, for, use, by, patrons, commonly, in, gender, segregated, changing, rooms, these, can, be, in, the, form, of, individual, stalls, shielded, by, curtains, or, a, door, or, communal, shower, rooms, the, latter, are, generally, large, open, rooms, with, any, number, of, shower, heads, installed, either, directly, into, the, walls, or, on, posts, throughout, the, shower, area, open, showers, are, often, provided, at, public, swimming, pools, and, at, popular, beaches, military, forces, around, the, world, set, up, field, showers, to, enable, the, washing, away, of, dangerous, residue, from, modern, weapons, such, as, caustic, chemicals, deadly, biological, agents, and, radioactive, materials, which, can, harm, forces, on, both, sides, of, a, conflict, a, wet, room, often, refers, to, a, bathroom, without, internal, dedicated, or, raised, areas, which, has, an, open, shower, structurally, a, wet, room, requires, the, bathroom, to, have, a, gradient, or, slope, towards, a, drain, hole, and, a, foul, air, trap, connecting, the, floor, to, the, waste, pipes, depending, on, region, the, term, wet, room, can, also, encompass, other, rooms, such, as, laundry, rooms, in, norway, for, example, any, room, with, tap, water, and, a, drain, in, the, floor, is, considered, a, wet, room, different, jurisdictions, often, have, special, regulations, concerning, the, design, and, construction, of, wet, rooms, to, prevent, damage, from, damp, air, or, water, leakage, e, g, mold, there, are, also, often, special, regulations, concerning, electrical, installations, in, wet, rooms, for, example, since, water, supplies, often, have, their, own, electrical, grounding, there, can, be, an, added, risk, of, injury, associated, with, ground, faults, and, some, jurisdictions, therefore, require, the, installation, of, residual, current, devices, in, wet, rooms, shower, usage, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, skyrocketed, personal, hygiene, became, a, primary, concern, and, bathing, every, day, or, multiple, times, a, day, is, common, among, western, cultures, showering, is, generally, faster, than, bathing, and, can, use, less, water, in, an, average, home, showers, are, typically, the, third, largest, water, use, after, toilets, and, clothes, washers, the, average, american, shower, uses, 17, 2, us, gallons, 65, l, 14, 3, imp, gal, and, lasts, for, 8, 2, minutes, at, an, average, flow, rate, of, 2, 1, us, gallons, 7, 9, l, 1, 7, imp, gal, per, minute, showering, is, one, of, the, leading, ways, people, use, water, in, the, home, accounting, for, nearly, 17, percent, of, residential, indoor, water, use, which, roughly, equals, to, 1, 200, 000, 000, us, gallons, 4, 5, 10, 9, l, 1, 00, 10, 9, imp, gal, of, water, annually, just, for, showering, the, us, environmental, protection, agency, recommends, to, retrofit, home, showers, with, a, shower, head, that, uses, less, than, 2, us, gallons, 7, 6, l, 1, 7, imp, gal, to, conserve, water, however, many, have, hypothesized, reducing, flow, rates, of, showerheads, might, cause, users, to, take, much, longer, showers, other, options, to, save, water, include, using, extra, high, pressure, mist, flow, or, design, in, sensors, and, valves, to, shut, off, or, reduce, water, flow, while, people, are, not, actively, using, the, shower, water, various, measures, can, be, taken, to, increase, safety, for, those, especially, elderly, people, taking, showers, or, baths, some, people, take, more, than, one, shower, each, day, normally, at, their, normal, shower, time, and, after, exercising, people, also, shower, to, cool, off, in, hot, weather, especially, those, unaccustomed, to, the, climate, used, shower, water, can, be, employed, as, greywater, showering, is, mostly, part, of, a, daily, routine, primarily, to, promote, cleanliness, and, prevent, odor, disease, and, infection, advances, in, science, and, medicine, in, the, 19th, century, began, to, realize, the, benefit, of, regular, bathing, to, an, individual, s, health, as, a, result, most, modern, cultures, encourage,

popular, especially, due, to, improvements, in, waterproofing, systems, and, prefabricated, components, places, such, as, a, swimming, pool, a, locker, room, or, a, military, facility, have, multiple, showers, there, may, be, communal, shower, rooms, without, divisions, or, shower, stalls, typically, open, at, the, top, many, types, of, showers, are, available, including, complete, shower, units,

purchased, separately, each, type, of, shower, poses, different, installation, issues, though, the, installation, requirements, of, each, of, shower, will, differ, the, installation, of, a, shower, in, general, requires, the, laying, of, several, water, transportation, pipes, including, a, pipe, for, hot, water, and, for, cold, water, and, a, drainage, pipe, it, is, important, that, the, wet, areas, of, a, bathroom, be, waterproof, and, multiple, layers, of, waterproofing, can, be, employed, grout, is, used, to, fill, gaps, between, tiles, but, grout, and, tile, setting, materials, are, generally, porous, tiles, are, generally, waterproof, though, a, shower, pan, must, be, installed, beneath, them, as, a, safety, to, prevent, water, leakage, thus, small, mosaic, tiles, offer, less, of, a, defense, than, large, format, tiles, sub, tile, waterproofing, is, important, when, tiles, are, being, used, best, practice, requires, a, waterproofing, material, to, cover, the, walls, and, floor, of, the, shower, area, that, are, then, covered, with, tile, or, in, some, countries, with, a, sheet, material, like, vinyl, a, shower, may, be, equipped, with, a, second, emergency, drain,

adjusted, to, spray, different, patterns, of, water, such, as, massage, gentle, spray, strong, spray, and, intermittent, pulse, or, combination, modes, hard, water, may, result, in, calcium, and, magnesium, deposits, clogging, the, head, reducing, the, flow, and, changing, the, spray, pattern, for, descaling, various, acidic, chemicals, or, brushes, can, be, used, or, some, heads, have, rubber, like, jets, that, can, be, manually, descaled, a, homemade, remedy, is, to, immerse, it, in, a, solution, of, water, and, vinegar, for, a, while, since, the, vinegar, is, able, to, dissolve,
