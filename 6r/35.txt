a, zipper, zip, or, fly, formerly, known, as, a, clasp, locker, is, a, commonly, used, device, for, binding, together, two, edges, of, fabric, or, other, flexible, material, used, in, clothing, e, g, jackets, and, jeans, luggage, and, other, bags, camping, gear, e, g, tents, and, sleeping, bags, and, many, other, items, zippers, come, in, a, wide, range, of, sizes, shapes, and, colors, in, 1892, whitcomb, l, judson, an, american, inventor, from, chicago, patented, the, original, design, from, which, the, modern, device, evolved, the, zipper, gets, its, name, from, a, brand, of, rubber, boots, or, galoshes, it, was, used, on, in, 1923, the, galoshes, could, be, fastened, with, a, single, zip, of, the, hand, and, soon, the, hookless, fasteners, came, to, be, called, zippers, a, zipper, consists, of, a, slider, mounted, on, two, rows, of, metal, or, plastic, teeth, that, are, designed, to, interlock, and, thereby, join, the, material, to, which, the, rows, are, attached, the, slider, usually, operated, by, hand, contains, a, y, shaped, channel, that, by, moving, along, the, rows, of, teeth, meshes, or, separates, them, depending, on, the, direction, of, the, slider, s, movement, the, teeth, may, be, individually, discrete, or, shaped, from, a, continuous, coil, and, are, also, referred, to, as, elements, the, word, zipper, is, onomatopoetic, because, it, was, named, for, the, sound, the, device, makes, when, used, a, high, pitched, zip, in, many, jackets, and, similar, garments, the, opening, is, closed, completely, when, the, slider, is, at, the, top, end, some, jackets, have, double, separating, zippers, with, two, sliders, on, the, tape, when, the, sliders, are, on, opposite, ends, of, the, tape, the, jacket, is, closed, if, the, lower, slider, is, raised, then, the, bottom, part, of, the, jacket, may, be, opened, to, allow, more, comfortable, sitting, or, bicycling, when, both, sliders, are, lowered, then, the, zipper, may, be, totally, separated, bags, suitcases, and, other, pieces, of, luggage, also, often, feature, two, sliders, on, the, tape, the, part, of, the, zipper, between, them, is, unfastened, when, the, two, sliders, are, located, next, to, each, other, they, slip, in, causing, the, male, area, to, get, pinched, because, its, so, massive, which, can, be, at, any, point, along, the, tape, the, zipper, is, fully, closed, zippers, may, these, variations, are, achieved, by, sewing, one, end, of, the, zipper, together, sewing, both, ends, together, or, allowing, both, ends, of, the, zipper, to, fall, completely, apart, a, zipper, costs, relatively, little, but, if, it, fails, the, garment, may, be, unusable, until, the, zipper, is, repaired, or, replaced, which, can, be, quite, difficult, and, expensive, problems, often, lie, with, the, zipper, slider, when, it, becomes, worn, it, does, not, properly, align, and, join, the, alternating, teeth, with, separating, zippers, the, insertion, pin, may, tear, loose, from, the, tape, the, tape, may, even, disintegrate, from, use, if, a, zipper, fails, it, can, either, jam, i, e, get, stuck, or, partially, break, off, in, 1851, elias, howe, received, a, patent, for, an, improvement, in, fastenings, for, garments, he, did, not, try, seriously, to, market, it, thus, missing, the, recognition, that, he, might, otherwise, have, received, howe, s, device, was, more, like, an, elaborate, drawstring, than, a, true, slide, fastener, forty, two, years, later, in, 1893, whitcomb, l, judson, who, invented, a, pneumatic, street, railway, patented, a, shoe, fastening, the, device, served, as, a, more, complicated, hook, and, eye, shoe, fastener, with, the, support, of, businessman, colonel, lewis, walker, judson, launched, the, universal, fastener, company, to, manufacture, the, new, device, judson, s, clasp, locker, had, its, public, debut, at, the, 1893, chicago, world, s, fair, and, met, with, little, commercial, success, judson, is, sometimes, given, credit, as, the, inventor, of, the, zipper, but, his, device, was, not, used, in, clothing, the, universal, fastener, company, moved, to, hoboken, new, jersey, in, 1901, reorganized, as, the, fastener, manufacturing, and, machine, company, gideon, sundb, ck, a, swedish, american, electrical, engineer, was, hired, to, work, for, the, company, in, 1906, good, technical, skills, and, marriage, to, the, plant, manager, s, daughter, elvira, aronson, led, sundb, ck, to, the, position, of, head, designer, the, company, moved, to, meadville, pennsylvania, where, it, operated, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, under, the, name, talon, inc, sundb, ck, worked, on, improving, the, fastener, and, in, 1909, he, registered, a, patent, in, germany, the, us, rights, to, this, invention, were, on, the, name, of, the, meadville, company, operating, as, the, hookless, fastener, co, but, sundb, ck, retained, non, u, s, rights, and, used, these, in, subsequent, years, to, set, up, lightning, fastener, co, in, st, catharines, ontario, canada, sundb, ck, s, work, with, this, firm, has, led, to, the, common, misperception, that, he, was, canadian, and, that, the, zipper, originated, in, that, country, in, 1916, newspapers, in, australia, reported, displays, of, the, new, hookless, fastener, a, device, from, america, that, the, world, has, been, waiting, for, by, a, live, model, in, the, store, window, of, raynor, s, of, melbourne, gideon, sundb, ck, increased, the, number, of, fastening, elements, from, four, per, inch, about, one, every, 6, 4, mm, to, ten, or, eleven, around, every, 2, 5, mm, introduced, two, facing, rows, of, teeth, that, pulled, into, a, single, piece, by, the, slider, and, increased, the, opening, for, the, teeth, guided, by, the, slider, the, patent, for, the, separable, fastener, was, issued, in, 1917, gideon, sundb, ck, also, created, the, manufacturing, machine, for, the, new, device, the, s, l, or, strapless, machine, took, a, special, y, shaped, wire, and, cut, scoops, from, it, then, punched, the, scoop, dimple, and, nib, and, clamped, each, scoop, on, a, cloth, tape, to, produce, a, continuous, zipper, chain, within, the, first, year, of, operation, sundb, ck, s, machinery, was, producing, a, few, hundred, feet, around, 100, meters, of, fastener, per, day, in, march, of, the, same, year, mathieu, burri, a, swiss, inventor, improved, the, design, by, adding, a, lock, in, system, attached, to, the, last, teeth, but, his, version, never, got, into, production, due, to, conflicting, patents, in, 1923, during, a, trip, to, europe, sundb, ck, sold, his, european, rights, to, martin, othmar, winterhalter, who, improved, the, design, by, using, ribs, and, grooves, instead, of, sundb, ck, s, joints, and, jaws, and, started, producing, with, his, company, riri, on, a, large, scale, first, in, germany, then, in, switzerland, the, popular, north, american, term, zipper, uk, zip, or, occasionally, zip, fastener, came, from, the, b, f, goodrich, company, in, 1923, the, company, used, gideon, sundb, ck, s, fastener, on, a, new, type, of, rubber, boots, or, galoshes, and, referred, to, it, as, the, zipper, and, the, name, stuck, the, two, chief, uses, of, the, zipper, in, its, early, years, were, for, closing, boots, and, tobacco, pouches, zippers, began, being, used, for, clothing, in, 1925, by, schott, nyc, on, leather, jackets, in, the, 1930s, a, sales, campaign, began, for, children, s, clothing, featuring, zippers, the, campaign, praised, zippers, for, promoting, self, reliance, in, young, children, by, making, it, possible, for, them, to, dress, themselves, the, zipper, beat, the, button, in, 1937, in, the, battle, of, the, fly, after, french, fashion, designers, raved, over, zippers, in, men, s, trousers, esquire, declared, the, zipper, the, newest, tailoring, idea, for, men, and, that, among, the, zippered, fly, s, many, virtues, was, that, it, would, exclude, the, possibility, of, unintentional, and, embarrassing, disarray, the, most, recent, innovation, in, the, zipper, s, design, was, the, introduction, of, models, that, could, open, on, both, ends, as, on, jackets, the, zipper, has, become, by, far, the, most, widespread, fastener, and, is, used, on, clothing, luggage, leather, goods, and, various, other, objects, airtight, zippers, were, first, developed, by, nasa, for, making, high, altitude, pressure, suits, and, later, space, suits, capable, of, retaining, air, pressure, inside, the, suit, in, the, vacuum, of, space, the, airtight, zipper, is, built, like, a, standard, toothed, zipper, but, with, a, waterproof, sheeting, which, is, made, of, fabric, reinforced, polyethylene, and, is, bonded, to, the, rest, of, the, suit, wrapped, around, the, outside, of, each, row, of, zipper, teeth, when, the, zipper, is, closed, the, two, facing, sides, of, the, plastic, sheeting, are, squeezed, tightly, against, one, another, between, the, c, shaped, clips, both, above, and, below, the, zipper, teeth, forming, a, double, seal, this, double, mated, surface, is, good, at, retaining, both, vacuum, and, pressure, but, the, fit, must, be, very, tight, to, press, the, surfaces, together, firmly, consequently, these, zippers, are, typically, very, stiff, when, zipped, shut, and, have, minimal, flex, or, stretch, they, are, hard, to, open, and, close, because, the, zipper, anvil, must, bend, apart, teeth, that, are, being, held, under, tension, they, can, also, be, derailed, causing, damage, to, the, sealing, surfaces, if, the, teeth, are, misaligned, while, straining, to, pull, the, zipper, shut, these, zippers, are, very, common, where, airtight, or, watertight, seals, are, needed, such, as, on, scuba, diving, dry, suits, ocean, survival, suits, and, hazmat, suits, a, less, common, water, resistant, zipper, is, similar, in, construction, to, a, standard, toothed, zipper, but, includes, a, molded, plastic, ridge, seal, similar, to, the, mating, surfaces, on, a, ziploc, bag, such, a, zipper, is, easier, to, open, and, close, than, a, clipped, version, and, the, slider, has, a, gap, above, the, zipper, teeth, for, separating, the, ridge, seal, this, seal, is, structurally, weak, against, internal, pressure, and, can, be, separated, by, pressure, within, the, sealed, container, pushing, outward, on, the, ridges, which, simply, flex, and, spread, apart, potentially, allowing, air, or, liquid, entry, ridge, sealed, zippers, are, sometimes, used, on, lower, cost, surface, dry, suits, some, zippers, include, a, designed, ability, for, the, slider, to, hold, in, a, steady, open, or, closed, position, resisting, forces, that, would, try, to, move, the, slider, and, open, the, zipper, unexpectedly, there, are, two, common, ways, this, is, accomplished, the, zipper, handle, can, have, a, short, protruding, pin, stamped, into, it, which, inserts, between, the, zipper, teeth, through, a, hole, on, the, slider, when, the, handle, is, folded, down, flat, against, the, zipper, teeth, this, appears, on, some, brands, of, trousers, the, handle, of, the, fly, zipper, is, folded, flat, against, the, teeth, when, it, is, not, in, use, and, the, handle, is, held, down, by, both, slider, hinge, tension, and, the, fabric, flap, over, the, fly, the, slider, can, also, have, a, two, piece, hinge, assembly, attaching, the, handle, to, the, slider, with, the, base, of, the, hinge, under, spring, tension, and, with, protruding, pins, on, the, bottom, that, insert, between, the, zipper, teeth, to, move, the, zipper, the, handle, is, pulled, outward, against, spring, tension, lifting, the, pins, out, from, between, the, teeth, as, the, slider, moves, when, the, handle, is, released, the, pins, automatically, engage, between, the, zipper, teeth, again, they, are, called, auto, lock, sliders, a, three, piece, version, of, the, above, uses, a, tiny, pivoting, arm, held, under, tension, inside, the, hinge, pulling, on, the, handle, from, any, direction, lifts, the, pivoting, arm, s, pins, out, of, the, zipper, teeth, so, that, the, slider, can, move, the, components, of, a, zipper, are, forbes, reported, in, 2003, that, although, the, zipper, market, in, the, 1960s, was, dominated, by, talon, zipper, us, and, optilon, germany, japanese, manufacturer, ykk, grew, to, become, the, industry, giant, by, the, 1980s, ykk, held, 45, percent, of, world, market, share, followed, by, optilon, 8, percent, and, talon, zipper, 7, percent, tex, corp, india, has, also, emerged, as, a, significant, supplier, to, the, apparel, industry, in, europe, the, cremalleras, rubi, company, was, established, in, 1926, in, spain, it, sold, over, 30, million, zippers, in, 2012, in, 2005, the, guardian, reported, that, china, had, 80, percent, of, the, international, market, most, of, its, product, is, made, in, qiaotou, yongjia, county, from, u, s, patent, 1, 219, 881, the, following, mechanism, of, the, zipper, improved, by, gideon, sundback, in, 1917, is, explained, the, locking, members, are, all, alike, and, therefore, interchangeable, and, in, general, form, consist, of, contractible, jaw, portions, which, are, clamped, upon, the, tape, and, projecting, locking, portions, of, elongated, cup, shape, so, that, the, outside, of, one, member, nests, within, the, recess, of, an, adjoining, member, when, in, locked, relation, consequently, it, will, be, seen, that, the, members, on, one, stringer, alternate, with, those, on, the, other, so, that, when, the, sliding, operating, device, is, moved, back, and, forth, the, locking, members, will, be, engaged, and, disengaged, according, to, the, direction, of, movement, a, further, feature, of, the, invention, resides, in, the, shape, and, configuration, of, the, locking, members, provided, with, exterior, and, interior, rounded, surfaces, and, are, somewhat, elongated, transversely, thereby, a, snug, fit, is, obtained, and, at, the, same, time, ample, provision, is, given, for, movement, of, one, on, the, other, without, coming, out, when, the, fastener, is, flexed, transversely, at, the, same, time, this, construction, gives, facility, for, relative, longitudinal, movement, without, disengagement, the, zipper, is, analogous, in, function, to, a, drawstring, but, different, in, mechanism, a, drawstring, works, by, tension, in, the, string, drawing, the, eyelets, of, the, piece, together, since, the, tension, acts, to, straighten, the, string, and, forces, the, eyelets, toward, a, line, the, zipper, works, by, an, elastic, that, is, reversible, deformation, of, the, locking, members, teeth, the, zipper, teeth, are, shaped, and, sized, so, that, the, forces, which, act, on, the, zipper, when, the, garment, it, is, sewn, on, is, worn, cannot, unlock, the, teeth, the, slider, constrains, the, teeth, positions, moves, them, along, a, given, path, and, acts, on, the, teeth, one, by, one, in, its, y, shaped, channel, and, so, can, reversibly, lock, and, unlock, them, this, is, a, lock, and, key, design, in, sundback, s, invention, the, teeth, are, symmetric, with, exterior, and, interior, rounded, surfaces, that, are, elongated, transversely, the, teeth, have, a, material, part, external, projection, and, a, space, internal, recess, the, material, part, of, one, tooth, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, space, on, the, other, and, so, shaped, to, act, as, a, contractible, jaw, the, jaw, is, elastically, opened, and, then, closed, as, it, goes, over, the, other, tooth, the, snug, fit, that, results, when, one, member, nests, within, the, recess, of, an, adjoining, member, is, a, stable, locked, state, the, maximum, force, when, the, slider, operates, is, in, between, the, unlocked, and, locked, positions, giving, two, stable, mechanical, equilibria, the, snug, fit, is, stable, not, only, to, forces, from, wear, that, act, in, the, same, direction, as, those, of, the, slider, but, also, to, transverse, and, longitudinal, both, perpendicular, forces, the, zipper, is, analogous, in, mechanism, to, a, bobby, pin, where, the, person, s, hand, slides, hair, into, and, out, of, the, pin, s, contractible, jaw, zippers, have, entered, into, urban, legends, american, folklorist, jan, brunvand, noted, that, the, zipper, has, been, the, subject, of, jokes, and, legends, since, the, 1920s, those, stories, reflect, modern, anxieties, and, desires, emphasizing, embarrassments, and, accidents, primarily, involving, the, flies, of, men, s, trousers, in, stories, such, as, the, unzipped, stranger, and, the, unzipped, fly, in, brave, new, world, aldous, huxley, repeatedly, mentioned, zippers, implying, that, in, their, newness, as, of, the, early, 1930s, mechanical, complexity, ease, of, use, and, speed, zippers, were, somehow, corrosive, of, natural, human, values, the, zipper, is, often, the, least, durable, component, in, any, garment, or, type, of, equipment, most, often, the, zipper, fails, to, close, due, to, a, worn, or, bent, slider, not, being, able, to, apply, the, necessary, force, to, the, sides, of, the, teeth, to, cause, them, to, interlock, this, problem, can, sometimes, be, redressed, by, using, small, pliers, to, carefully, squeeze, the, back, part, of, the, slider, together, a, fraction, of, a, millimeter, this, can, compensate, for, the, wear, of, the, slider, the, slider, is, typically, made, as, a, magnesium, diecast, which, breaks, easily, it, is, necessary, to, reduce, the, force, on, the, pliers, before, it, can, be, felt, that, the, slider, actually, gives, in, if, it, is, not, yet, possible, to, successfully, close, the, zipper, the, pressure, applied, to, the, slider, should, only, gradually, be, increased, another, way, to, reduce, the, gap, of, the, open, end, of, the, slider, is, by, preparing, a, small, block, of, wood, by, sawing, a, slot, into, one, end, so, that, it, fits, over, the, upper, arm, of, the, slider, then, a, hammer, can, be, used, to, exact, a, force, onto, the, slider, by, carefully, hitting, the, wood, when, the, protective, coating, of, the, diecast, slider, has, been, worn, off, by, prolonged, use, the, material, can, corrode, the, corrosion, products, are, usually, metal, salts, which, can, accumulate, and, block, the, slider, from, moving, when, this, happens, the, salt, can, often, be, dissolved, by, submerging, the, slider, in, vinegar, or, another, mild, acid, otherwise, the, slider, needs, to, be, removed, and, replaced
