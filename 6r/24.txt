comprising, a, suit, jacket, and, trousers, of, identical, textiles, generally, worn, with, a, collared, dress, shirt, necktie, and, dress, shoes, a, skirt, suit, is, similar, but, with, a, matching, skirt, instead, of, trousers, it, is, currently, considered, semi, formal, wear, or, business, wear, in, contemporary, western, dress, codes, however, when, the, suit, was, originally, developed, it, was, considered, an, informal, or, more, casual, option, compared, to, the, prevailing, clothing, standards, of, aristocrats, and, businessmen, the, lounge, suit, originated, in, 19th, century, britain, as, sportswear, and, british, country, clothing, which, is, why, it, was, seen, as, more, casual, than, citywear, at, that, time, with, the, roots, of, the, suit, coming, from, early, modern, western, europe, formal, court, or, military, clothes, after, replacing, the, black, frock, coat, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, regular, daywear, a, sober, one, coloured, suit, became, known, as, a, lounge, suit, suits, are, offered, in, different, designs, and, constructions, cut, and, cloth, whether, two, or, three, piece, single, or, double, breasted, vary, in, addition, to, various, accessories, a, two, piece, suit, has, a, jacket, and, trousers, a, three, piece, suit, adds, a, waistcoat, hats, were, almost, always, worn, outdoors, and, sometimes, indoors, with, all, men, s, clothes, until, the, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, in, western, culture, informal, suits, have, been, traditionally, worn, with, a, fedora, a, trilby, or, a, flat, cap, other, accessories, include, handkerchief, suspenders, or, belt, watch, and, jewelry, other, notable, types, of, suits, are, for, what, would, now, be, considered, formal, occasions, the, tuxedo, or, dinner, suit, black, tie, and, the, black, lounge, suit, stroller, both, which, originally, arose, as, less, formal, alternatives, for, the, prior, formal, wear, standards, known, as, white, tie, which, incorporated, items, such, as, the, dress, coat, and, of, morning, dress, which, incorporated, items, such, as, the, morning, coat, with, formal, trousers, originally, suits, were, always, tailor, made, from, the, client, s, selected, cloth, these, are, now, known, as, bespoke, suits, custom, made, to, measurements, taste, and, style, preferences, since, the, 1960s, most, suits, have, been, mass, produced, ready, to, wear, garments, currently, suits, are, offered, in, roughly, four, ways, the, word, suit, derives, from, the, french, suite, meaning, following, from, some, late, latin, derivative, form, of, the, latin, verb, sequor, i, follow, because, the, component, garments, jacket, and, trousers, and, waistcoat, follow, each, other, and, have, the, same, cloth, and, colour, and, are, worn, together, as, a, suit, in, this, sense, covers, all, or, most, of, the, wearer, s, body, the, term, suit, was, extended, to, a, single, garment, that, covers, all, or, most, of, the, body, such, as, boilersuits, diving, suits, and, spacesuits, the, suit, s, origins, trace, the, simplified, sartorial, standard, established, by, the, english, king, charles, ii, in, the, 17th, century, following, the, example, of, his, one, time, host, king, louis, xiv, s, court, at, versailles, who, decreed, that, in, the, english, court, men, would, wear, a, long, coat, a, waistcoat, then, called, a, petticoat, a, cravat, a, precursor, of, the, necktie, a, wig, knee, breeches, trousers, and, a, hat, the, paintings, of, jan, steen, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, and, other, painters, of, the, dutch, golden, era, reveal, that, such, an, arrangement, was, already, used, in, holland, if, not, western, europe, as, a, whole, the, current, styles, founded, in, the, great, male, renunciation, of, the, late, 18th, century, sharply, changed, the, elaborately, embroidered, and, jewelled, formal, clothing, into, the, simpler, clothing, of, the, british, regency, period, which, gradually, evolved, to, the, stark, formality, of, the, victorian, era, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, in, the, search, for, more, comfort, that, the, loosening, of, rules, gave, rise, to, the, modern, lounge, suit, brooks, brothers, is, generally, credited, with, first, offering, the, ready, to, wear, suit, a, suit, that, was, sold, already, manufactured, and, sized, ready, to, be, tailored, while, haggar, clothing, first, introduced, the, concept, of, suit, separates, in, the, u, s, which, are, widely, found, in, the, marketplace, today, there, are, many, possible, variations, in, the, choice, of, the, style, the, garments, and, the, details, of, a, suit, the, silhouette, of, a, suit, is, its, outline, tailored, balance, created, from, a, canvas, fitting, allows, a, balanced, silhouette, so, a, jacket, need, not, be, buttoned, and, a, garment, is, not, too, tight, or, too, loose, a, proper, garment, is, shaped, from, the, neck, to, the, chest, and, shoulders, to, drape, without, wrinkles, from, tension, shape, is, the, essential, part, of, tailoring, that, often, takes, hand, work, from, the, start, the, two, main, cuts, are, double, breasted, suits, a, conservative, design, with, two, columns, of, buttons, spanned, by, a, large, overlap, of, the, left, and, right, sides, and, single, breasted, suits, in, which, the, sides, meet, in, the, centre, of, the, torso, with, a, single, column, of, buttons, overlapping, only, enough, for, one, two, or, three, buttons, to, close, with, by, convention, the, jacket, front, cut, so, that, the, lowest, button, is, not, designed, to, close, good, tailoring, anywhere, in, the, world, is, characterised, by, strongly, tapered, sides, and, minimal, shoulder, whereas, rack, suits, are, often, padded, to, reduce, labour, more, casual, suits, are, characterised, by, less, construction, and, tailoring, much, like, the, sack, suit, a, loose, american, style, there, are, three, ways, to, buy, suits, the, acid, test, of, authentic, tailoring, standards, is, the, wrinkle, that, comes, from, poor, tailoring, rumples, can, be, pressed, out, for, interim, fittings, rock, of, eye, which, means, trained, freehand, based, on, an, experienced, artistic, eye, to, match, the, item, to, the, wearer, trusting, the, eye, over, unyielding, scripted, approach, drawing, and, cutting, inaccuracies, are, overcome, by, the, fitting, suits, are, made, in, a, variety, of, fabrics, but, most, commonly, from, wool, silk, or, cotton, the, two, main, yarns, produce, worsteds, where, the, fibres, are, combed, before, spinning, to, produce, a, smooth, hard, wearing, cloth, and, woollens, where, they, are, not, combed, thus, remaining, comparatively, fluffy, in, texture, these, can, be, woven, in, a, number, of, ways, producing, flannel, tweed, gabardine, and, fresco, among, others, these, fabrics, all, have, different, weights, and, feels, and, some, fabrics, have, an, s, or, super, s, number, describing, the, fineness, of, the, fibres, measured, by, average, fibre, diameter, e, g, super, 120, the, finer, the, fabric, the, more, delicate, and, thus, less, likely, to, be, long, wearing, it, will, be, although, wool, has, traditionally, been, associated, with, warm, bulky, clothing, meant, for, warding, off, cold, weather, advances, in, making, finer, and, finer, fibre, have, made, wool, suits, acceptable, for, warmer, weather, as, fabrics, have, accordingly, become, lighter, and, more, supple, wool, fabric, is, denominated, by, the, weight, of, a, one, square, yard, piece, thus, the, heavier, wools, suitable, for, winter, only, are, 12, 14, oz, the, medium, three, season, i, e, excluding, summer, are, 10, 11, oz, and, summer, wools, are, 7, 8, oz, in, the, days, before, central, heating, heavier, wools, such, as, 16, oz, were, used, in, suits, now, they, are, used, mainly, in, overcoats, and, topcoats, other, materials, are, used, sometimes, either, alone, or, blended, with, wool, such, as, cashmere, silk, alone, or, blended, with, wool, is, sometimes, used, synthetic, materials, e, g, polyester, while, cheaper, are, very, rarely, recommended, by, experts, at, most, a, blend, of, predominantly, wool, may, be, acceptable, to, obtain, the, main, benefit, of, synthetics, namely, resistance, to, wrinkling, particularly, in, garments, used, for, travel, however, any, synthetic, blended, or, otherwise, will, always, be, warmer, and, clammier, than, wool, alone, for, hot, weather, linen, is, also, used, and, in, the, southern, united, states, cotton, seersucker, is, worn, the, main, four, colours, for, suits, worn, in, business, are, black, light, grey, dark, grey, and, navy, either, with, or, without, patterns, in, particular, grey, flannel, suiting, has, been, worn, very, widely, since, the, 1930s, in, non, business, settings, or, less, formal, business, contexts, brown, is, another, important, colour, olive, also, occurs, in, summer, lighter, shades, such, as, tan, or, cream, are, popular, for, non, business, use, tweed, has, been, popular, since, victorian, times, and, still, is, commonly, worn, a, wide, range, of, colour, is, available, including, muted, shades, of, green, brown, red, and, grey, tweeds, are, usually, checked, or, plain, with, a, herringbone, weave, and, are, most, associated, with, the, country, while, full, tweed, suits, are, not, worn, by, many, now, the, jackets, are, often, worn, as, sports, jackets, with, odd, trousers, trousers, of, different, cloth, the, most, conventional, suit, has, two, or, three, buttons, and, is, either, medium, to, dark, grey, or, navy, other, conservative, colours, are, grey, black, and, olive, white, and, light, blues, are, acceptable, at, some, events, especially, in, the, warm, season, red, and, the, brighter, greens, are, usually, considered, unconventional, and, garish, tradition, calls, for, a, gentleman, s, suit, to, be, of, decidedly, plain, colour, with, splashes, of, bright, colour, reserved, for, shirts, neckties, or, kerchiefs, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, lounge, suits, were, never, traditionally, worn, in, plain, black, this, colour, instead, being, reserved, for, formal, wear, including, dinner, jackets, or, strollers, and, for, undertakers, however, the, decline, of, formal, wear, since, the, 1950s, and, the, rise, of, casual, wear, in, 1960s, allowed, the, black, suit, to, return, to, fashion, as, many, designers, began, wanting, to, move, away, from, the, business, suit, toward, more, fashion, suits, traditional, business, suits, are, generally, in, solid, colours, or, with, pinstripes, windowpane, checks, are, also, acceptable, outside, business, the, range, of, acceptable, patterns, widens, with, plaids, such, as, the, traditional, glen, plaid, and, herringbone, though, apart, from, some, very, traditional, environments, such, as, london, banking, these, are, worn, for, business, now, as, well, the, colour, of, the, patterned, element, stripes, plaids, and, checks, varies, by, gender, and, location, for, example, bold, checks, particularly, with, tweeds, have, fallen, out, of, use, in, the, us, while, they, continue, to, be, worn, as, traditional, in, britain, some, unusual, old, patterns, such, as, diamonds, are, now, rare, everywhere, inside, the, jacket, of, a, suit, between, the, outer, fabric, and, the, inner, lining, there, is, a, layer, of, sturdy, interfacing, fabric, to, prevent, the, wool, from, stretching, out, of, shape, this, layer, of, cloth, is, called, the, canvas, after, the, fabric, from, which, it, was, traditionally, made, expensive, jackets, have, a, floating, canvas, while, cheaply, manufactured, models, have, a, fused, glued, canvas, a, fused, canvas, is, less, soft, and, if, poorly, done, damages, the, suppleness, and, durability, of, the, jacket, so, many, tailors, are, quick, to, deride, fused, canvas, as, being, less, durable, particularly, since, they, may, tend, to, permanently, pucker, along, the, jacket, s, edges, after, some, use, or, a, few, dry, cleanings, however, some, selling, this, type, of, jacket, claim, that, the, difference, in, quality, is, very, small, a, few, london, tailors, state, that, all, bespoke, suits, should, use, a, floating, canvas, most, single, breasted, suits, have, two, or, three, buttons, and, four, or, more, buttons, are, unusual, dinner, jackets, black, tie, usually, have, only, one, button, it, is, rare, to, find, a, suit, with, more, than, four, buttons, although, zoot, suits, can, have, as, many, as, six, or, more, due, to, their, longer, length, there, is, also, variation, in, the, placement, and, style, of, buttons, since, the, button, placement, is, critical, to, the, overall, impression, of, height, conveyed, by, the, jacket, the, centre, or, top, button, will, typically, line, up, quite, closely, with, the, natural, waistline, the, bottom, button, is, usually, not, meant, to, be, buttoned, and, so, the, jacket, is, cut, such, that, buttoning, the, bottom, button, would, ruin, the, lines, and, drape, of, the, jacket, it, is, customary, to, keep, the, jacket, buttoned, while, standing, and, to, unbutton, the, jacket, while, seated, double, breasted, jackets, have, only, half, their, outer, buttons, functional, as, the, second, row, is, for, display, only, forcing, them, to, come, in, pairs, some, rare, jackets, can, have, as, few, as, two, buttons, and, during, various, periods, for, instance, the, 1960s, and, 70s, as, many, as, eight, were, seen, six, buttons, are, typical, with, two, to, button, the, last, pair, floats, above, the, overlap, the, three, buttons, down, each, side, may, in, this, case, be, in, a, straight, line, the, keystone, layout, or, more, commonly, the, top, pair, is, half, as, far, apart, again, as, each, pair, in, the, bottom, square, a, four, button, double, breasted, jacket, usually, buttons, in, a, square, the, layout, of, the, buttons, and, the, shape, of, the, lapel, are, co, ordinated, in, order, to, direct, the, eyes, of, an, observer, for, example, if, the, buttons, are, too, low, or, the, lapel, roll, too, pronounced, the, eyes, are, drawn, down, from, the, face, and, the, waist, appears, larger, there, seems, to, be, no, clear, rule, as, to, on, which, side, the, overlap, should, lie, it, usually, crosses, naturally, with, the, left, side, to, the, fore, but, not, invariably, generally, a, hidden, button, holds, the, underlap, in, place, the, jacket, s, lapels, can, be, notched, also, called, stepped, peaked, pointed, shawl, or, trick, mandarin, and, other, unconventional, styles, each, lapel, style, carries, different, connotations, and, is, worn, with, different, cuts, of, suit, notched, lapels, the, most, common, of, the, three, are, usually, only, found, on, single, breasted, jackets, and, are, the, most, informal, style, they, are, distinguished, by, a, 75, to, 90, degree, notch, at, the, point, where, the, lapel, meets, the, collar, peaked, lapels, have, sharp, edges, that, point, upward, towards, the, shoulders, double, breasted, jackets, usually, have, peaked, lapels, although, peaked, lapels, are, sometimes, found, on, single, breasted, jackets, as, well, shawl, lapels, are, a, style, derived, from, the, victorian, informal, evening, wear, and, as, such, are, not, normally, seen, on, suit, jackets, except, for, tuxedos, or, dinner, suits, for, black, tie, events, only, jackets, with, pointed, and, shawl, lapels, should, be, worn, in, the, 1980s, double, breasted, suits, with, notched, lapels, were, popular, with, power, suits, and, the, new, wave, style, in, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, a, design, considered, very, stylish, was, the, single, breasted, peaked, lapel, jacket, this, has, gone, in, and, out, of, vogue, periodically, being, popular, once, again, during, the, 1970s, and, is, still, a, recognised, alternative, the, ability, to, properly, cut, peaked, lapels, on, a, single, breasted, suit, is, one, of, the, most, challenging, tailoring, tasks, even, for, very, experienced, tailors, the, width, of, the, lapel, is, a, varying, aspect, of, suits, and, has, changed, over, the, years, the, 1930s, and, 1970s, featured, exceptionally, wide, lapels, whereas, during, the, late, 1950s, and, most, of, the, 1960s, suits, with, very, narrow, lapels, often, only, about, 1, inch, 2, 5, cm, wide, were, in, fashion, the, 1980s, saw, mid, size, lapels, with, a, low, gorge, the, point, on, the, jacket, that, forms, the, notch, or, peak, between, the, collar, and, front, lapel, current, mid, 2000s, trends, are, towards, a, narrower, lapel, and, higher, gorge, necktie, width, usually, follows, the, width, of, the, jacket, lapel, lapels, also, have, a, buttonhole, intended, to, hold, a, boutonni, re, a, decorative, flower, these, are, now, only, commonly, seen, at, more, formal, events, usually, double, breasted, suits, have, one, hole, on, each, lapel, with, a, flower, just, on, the, left, while, single, breasted, suits, have, just, one, on, the, left, most, jackets, have, a, variety, of, inner, pockets, and, two, main, outer, pockets, which, are, generally, either, patch, pockets, flap, pockets, or, jetted, besom, pockets, the, patch, pocket, is, with, its, single, extra, piece, of, cloth, sewn, directly, onto, the, front, of, the, jacket, a, sporting, option, sometimes, seen, on, summer, linen, suits, or, other, informal, styles, the, flap, pocket, is, standard, for, side, pockets, and, has, an, extra, lined, flap, of, matching, fabric, covering, the, top, of, the, pocket, a, jetted, pocket, is, most, formal, with, a, small, strip, of, fabric, taping, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, slit, for, the, pocket, this, style, is, most, often, on, seen, on, formalwear, such, as, a, dinner, jacket, a, breast, pocket, is, usually, found, at, the, left, side, where, a, pocket, square, or, handkerchief, can, be, displayed, in, addition, to, the, standard, two, outer, pockets, and, breast, pocket, some, suits, have, a, fourth, the, ticket, pocket, usually, located, just, above, the, right, pocket, and, roughly, half, as, wide, while, this, was, originally, exclusively, a, feature, of, country, suits, used, for, conveniently, storing, a, train, ticket, it, is, now, seen, on, some, town, suits, another, country, feature, also, worn, sometimes, in, cities, is, a, pair, of, hacking, pockets, which, are, similar, to, normal, ones, but, slanted, this, was, originally, designed, to, make, the, pockets, easier, to, open, on, horseback, while, hacking, suit, jackets, in, all, styles, typically, have, three, or, four, buttons, on, each, cuff, which, are, often, purely, decorative, the, sleeve, is, usually, sewn, closed, and, cannot, be, unbuttoned, to, open, five, buttons, are, unusual, and, are, a, modern, fashion, innovation, the, number, of, buttons, is, primarily, a, function, of, the, formality, of, the, suit, a, very, casual, summer, sports, jacket, might, traditionally, 1930s, have, had, only, one, button, while, tweed, suits, typically, have, three, and, city, suits, four, in, the, 1970s, two, buttons, were, seen, on, some, city, suits, today, four, buttons, are, common, on, most, business, suits, and, even, casual, suits, although, the, sleeve, buttons, usually, cannot, be, undone, the, stitching, is, such, that, it, appears, they, could, functional, cuff, buttons, may, be, found, on, high, end, or, bespoke, suits, this, feature, is, called, a, surgeon, s, cuff, and, working, button, holes, u, s, some, wearers, leave, these, buttons, undone, to, reveal, that, they, can, afford, a, bespoke, suit, although, it, is, proper, to, leave, these, buttons, done, up, modern, bespoke, styles, and, high, end, off, the, rack, suits, equipped, with, surgeon, s, cuffs, have, the, last, two, buttons, stitched, off, centre, so, that, the, sleeve, hangs, more, cleanly, should, the, buttons, ever, be, undone, certainty, in, fitting, sleeve, length, must, be, achieved, as, once, working, button, holes, are, cut, the, sleeve, length, essentially, cannot, be, altered, further, a, cuffed, sleeve, has, an, extra, length, of, fabric, folded, back, over, the, arm, or, just, some, piping, or, stitching, above, the, buttons, to, allude, to, the, edge, of, a, cuff, this, was, popular, in, the, edwardian, era, as, a, feature, of, formalwear, such, as, frock, coats, carried, over, to, informalwear, but, is, now, rare, a, vent, is, a, slit, in, the, bottom, rear, the, tail, of, the, jacket, originally, vents, were, a, sporting, option, designed, to, make, riding, easier, so, are, traditional, on, hacking, jackets, formal, coats, such, as, a, morning, coat, and, for, practicality, overcoats, today, there, are, three, styles, of, venting, the, single, vented, style, with, one, vent, at, the, centre, the, ventless, style, and, the, double, vented, style, one, vent, on, each, side, vents, are, convenient, particularly, when, using, a, pocket, or, sitting, down, to, improve, the, hang, of, the, jacket, so, are, now, used, on, most, jackets, ventless, jackets, are, associated, with, italian, tailoring, while, the, double, vented, style, is, typically, british, dinner, jackets, traditionally, have, no, vents, waistcoats, called, vests, in, american, english, were, almost, always, worn, with, suits, prior, to, the, 1940s, due, to, rationing, during, world, war, ii, their, prevalence, declined, but, their, popularity, has, gone, in, and, out, of, fashion, from, the, 1970s, onwards, a, pocket, watch, on, a, chain, one, end, of, which, is, inserted, through, a, middle, buttonhole, is, often, worn, with, a, waistcoat, otherwise, since, world, war, i, when, they, came, to, prominence, of, military, necessity, men, have, worn, wristwatches, which, may, be, worn, with, any, suit, except, the, full, evening, dress, white, tie, although, many, examples, of, waistcoats, worn, with, a, double, breasted, jacket, can, be, found, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1940s, that, would, be, unusual, today, one, point, of, a, double, breasted, jacket, being, it, may, be, supposed, to, eliminate, the, waistcoat, traditionally, the, bottom, button, of, a, waistcoat, is, left, undone, like, the, vents, in, the, rear, of, a, jacket, this, helps, the, body, bend, when, sitting, some, waistcoats, can, have, lapels, others, do, not, suit, trousers, are, always, made, of, the, same, material, as, the, jacket, even, from, the, 1910s, to, 1920s, before, the, invention, of, sports, jackets, specifically, to, be, worn, with, odd, trousers, wearing, a, suit, jacket, with, odd, trousers, was, seen, as, an, alternative, to, a, full, suit, however, with, the, modern, advent, of, sports, jackets, suit, jackets, are, always, worn, with, matching, trousers, and, the, trousers, are, worn, with, no, jacket, or, the, appropriate, jacket, trouser, width, has, varied, considerably, throughout, the, decades, in, the, 1920s, trousers, were, straight, legged, and, wide, legged, with, a, standard, width, at, the, cuff, of, 23, inches, 58, cm, after, 1935, trousers, began, to, be, tapered, in, at, the, bottom, half, of, the, leg, trousers, remained, wide, at, the, top, of, the, leg, throughout, the, 1940s, by, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, a, more, slim, look, had, become, popular, in, the, 1970s, suit, makers, offered, a, variety, of, styles, of, trousers, including, flared, bell, bottomed, wide, legged, and, more, traditional, tapered, trousers, in, the, 1980s, these, styles, disappeared, in, favor, of, tapered, slim, legged, trousers, one, variation, in, the, design, of, trousers, is, the, use, or, not, of, pleats, the, most, classic, style, of, trouser, is, to, have, two, pleats, usually, forward, since, this, gives, more, comfort, sitting, and, better, hang, standing, this, is, still, a, common, style, and, for, these, reasons, of, utility, has, been, worn, throughout, the, 20th, century, the, style, originally, descended, from, the, exaggeratedly, widened, oxford, bags, worn, in, the, 1930s, in, oxford, which, though, themselves, short, lived, began, a, trend, for, fuller, fronts, the, style, is, still, seen, as, the, smartest, featuring, on, dress, trousers, with, black, and, white, tie, however, at, various, periods, throughout, the, last, century, flat, fronted, trousers, with, no, pleats, have, been, worn, and, the, swing, in, fashions, has, been, marked, enough, that, the, more, fashion, oriented, ready, to, wear, brands, have, not, produced, both, types, continuously, turn, ups, on, the, bottom, of, trousers, or, cuffs, were, initially, popularised, in, the, 1890s, by, edward, vii, and, were, popular, with, suits, throughout, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, they, have, always, been, an, informal, option, being, inappropriate, on, all, formalwear, other, variations, in, trouser, style, include, the, rise, of, the, trouser, this, was, very, high, in, the, early, half, of, the, 20th, century, particularly, with, formalwear, with, rises, above, the, natural, waist, to, allow, the, waistcoat, covering, the, waistband, to, come, down, just, below, the, narrowest, point, of, the, chest, though, serving, less, purpose, this, high, height, was, duplicated, in, the, daywear, of, the, period, since, then, fashions, have, changed, and, have, rarely, been, that, high, again, with, styles, returning, more, to, low, rise, trousers, even, dropping, down, to, have, waistbands, resting, on, the, hips, other, changing, aspects, of, the, cut, include, the, length, which, determines, the, break, the, bunching, of, fabric, just, above, the, shoe, when, the, front, seam, is, marginally, longer, than, height, to, the, shoe, s, top, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, europe, traditionally, opt, for, shorter, trousers, with, little, or, no, break, while, americans, often, choose, to, wear, a, slight, break, a, final, major, distinction, is, made, in, whether, the, trousers, take, a, belt, or, braces, suspenders, while, a, belt, was, originally, never, worn, with, a, suit, the, forced, wearing, of, belts, during, wartime, years, caused, by, restrictions, on, use, of, elastic, caused, by, wartime, shortages, contributed, to, their, rise, in, popularity, with, braces, now, much, less, popular, than, belts, when, braces, were, common, the, buttons, for, attaching, them, were, placed, on, the, outside, of, the, waistband, because, they, would, be, covered, by, a, waistcoat, or, cardigan, but, now, it, is, more, frequent, to, button, on, the, inside, of, the, trouser, trousers, taking, braces, are, rather, different, in, cut, at, the, waist, employing, extra, girth, and, also, height, at, the, back, the, split, in, the, waistband, at, the, back, is, in, the, fishtail, shape, those, who, prefer, braces, assert, that, because, they, hang, from, the, shoulders, they, always, make, the, trousers, fit, and, hang, exactly, as, they, should, while, a, belt, may, allow, the, trouser, waist, to, slip, down, on, the, hips, or, below, a, protruding, midsection, and, requires, constant, repositioning, also, they, allow, indeed, work, best, with, a, slightly, looser, waist, which, gives, room, for, natural, expansion, when, seated, suit, trousers, also, known, as, dress, pants, in, the, us, are, a, style, of, trousers, intended, as, formal, semi, formal, or, informal, wear, they, are, often, made, of, either, wool, or, polyester, although, many, other, synthetic, and, natural, textiles, are, used, and, may, be, designed, to, be, worn, with, a, matching, suit, jacket, suit, trousers, often, have, a, crease, in, the, front, of, each, pant, leg, and, may, have, one, or, more, pleats, suit, trousers, can, be, worn, at, many, formal, and, semi, formal, occasions, combined, with, a, shirt, that, has, no, tie, and, a, more, relaxed, fashion, which, can, be, considered, smart, casual, dress, as, an, alternative, to, trousers, breeches, or, knickers, in, variations, of, english, where, this, does, not, refer, to, underwear, may, be, worn, with, informal, suits, such, as, tweed, these, are, shorter, descending, to, just, below, the, knees, fastened, closely, at, the, top, of, the, calf, by, a, tab, or, button, cuff, while, once, common, they, are, now, typically, only, worn, when, engaged, in, traditional, outdoor, sports, such, as, shooting, or, golf, the, length, and, design, is, closely, related, to, the, plus, fours, and, plus, sixes, etc, worn, for, sport, but, differ, in, having, no, bagginess, they, are, usually, designed, to, be, worn, with, long, socks, meeting, just, below, the, knee, but, riding, breeches, worn, with, long, boots, such, as, top, boots, are, long, enough, to, meet, the, boot, and, display, no, sock, accessories, for, suits, include, neckties, shoes, wristwatches, and, pocket, watches, pocket, squares, cufflinks, tie, clips, tie, tacks, tie, bars, bow, ties, lapel, pins, and, hats, the, buttoning, of, the, jacket, is, primarily, determined, by, the, button, stance, a, measure, of, how, high, the, buttons, are, in, relation, to, the, natural, waist, in, some, now, unusual, styles, where, the, buttons, are, placed, high, the, tailor, would, have, intended, the, suit, to, be, buttoned, differently, from, the, more, common, lower, stance, nevertheless, some, general, guidelines, are, given, here, double, breasted, suit, coats, are, almost, always, kept, buttoned, when, there, is, more, than, one, functional, buttonhole, as, in, a, traditional, six, on, two, arrangement, only, one, button, need, be, fastened, the, wearer, may, elect, to, fasten, only, the, bottom, button, in, order, to, present, a, longer, line, a, style, popularised, by, prince, george, duke, of, kent, single, breasted, suit, coats, may, be, either, fastened, or, unfastened, in, two, button, suits, the, bottom, button, is, traditionally, left, unfastened, except, with, certain, unusual, cuts, of, jacket, e, g, the, paddock, legend, has, it, that, king, edward, vii, started, the, trend, of, leaving, the, bottom, button, of, a, suit, as, well, as, waistcoat, undone, the, reasoning, for, having, only, the, top, buttons, and, not, the, bottom, button, to, continue, being, fastened, is, to, avoid, stressing, of, the, fabric, and, is, more, comfortable, for, the, wearer, when, fastening, a, three, button, suit, the, middle, button, is, fastened, and, the, top, one, sometimes, but, the, bottom, is, traditionally, not, designed, to, be, although, in, the, past, some, three, button, jackets, were, cut, so, that, all, three, could, be, fastened, without, distorting, the, drape, this, is, no, longer, the, case, a, four, button, suit, is, uncommon, the, one, button, suit, has, regained, some, popularity, it, is, also, one, of, the, classic, styles, of, savile, row, tailoring, with, a, single, breasted, suit, the, buttons, are, usually, unfastened, while, sitting, down, to, avoid, an, ugly, drape, a, double, breasted, suit, is, often, able, to, be, left, buttoned, to, avoid, the, difficulty, of, constantly, redoing, the, inner, button, the, anchor, button, when, standing, up, in, the, united, states, it, is, common, for, socks, to, match, either, the, shoe, particularly, black, socks, with, black, shoes, or, the, trouser, leg, this, latter, is, preferred, as, it, makes, the, leg, appear, longer, provides, a, smoother, visual, transition, between, the, pant, leg, and, the, shoe, and, minimises, the, attention, drawn, by, a, trouser, leg, tailored, to, be, too, short, a, more, general, rule, is, for, socks, to, be, darker, than, the, shade, of, the, trousers, but, potentially, a, different, instead, matching, some, other, part, of, the, outfit, such, as, the, shirt, or, necktie, with, patterned, socks, ideally, the, background, colour, of, the, sock, should, match, the, primary, colour, of, the, suit, and, the, other, colors, should, coordinate, with, other, parts, of, the, outfit, socks, are, preferably, at, least, mid, calf, height, if, not, knee, height, over, the, calf, and, are, usually, made, predominantly, of, cotton, or, wool, though, luxury, or, dress, socks, may, use, more, exotic, blends, such, as, silk, and, cashmere, before, world, war, ii, patterned, socks, were, common, and, a, variety, of, designs, like, argyle, or, contrasting, socks, were, commonly, seen, after, wwii, socks, became, more, subdued, in, colour, in, lieu, of, over, the, calf, length, which, will, stay, up, by, itself, some, men, still, use, garters, to, hold, up, their, socks, but, this, is, unusual, suit, wearing, etiquette, for, women, generally, follows, the, same, guidelines, used, by, men, with, a, few, differences, and, more, flexibility, for, women, the, skirt, suit, or, dress, suit, are, both, acceptable, a, blouse, which, can, be, white, or, coloured, usually, takes, the, place, of, a, shirt, women, s, suits, can, also, be, worn, with, coloured, tops, or, t, shirts, also, women, usually, wear, suits, in, professional, settings, rather, than, as, general, formal, attire, as, men, do, women, s, suits, come, in, a, larger, variety, of, colours, such, as, darks, pastels, and, gem, colours, women, generally, do, not, wear, neckties, with, their, suits, but, some, do, fancy, silk,

their, dress, fashions, adopted, looks, not, dissimilar, from, men, s, business, wear, by, the, early, to, mid, 1980s, conservatively, tailored, skirt, suits, were, the, norm, in, the, same, colours, and, fabrics, considered, standard, in, men, s, suits, these, were, typically, worn, with, buttoned, up, collared, blouses, usually, white, or, some, pastel, in, colour, these, were, frequently, accessorised, with, a, version, of, the, bow, tie, usually, the, same, fabrics, colours, and, patterns, as, men, s, neckties, and, bow, ties, but, tied, in, a, fuller, bow, at, the, collar, pantyhose,

during, the, 1960s, were, widely, imitated, by, the, mod, subculture, and, underwent, a, large, scale, revival, during, the, late, 2000s, to, mid, 2010s, due, to, their, association, with, james, bond, and, don, draper, from, mad, men, elsewhere, in, the, mediterranean, suits, are, considered, impractical, without, constant, air, conditioning, as, a, result, most, non, conservative, businesses, regardless, of, size, or, wealth, tend, to, use, casual, clothes, even, in, formal, meetings, some, professions, such, as, banking, law, and, certain, government, employees, that, deal, directly, with, the, public, do, have, a, more, formal, dress, code, because, wearing, a, suit, conveys, a, respectable, image, many, people, wear, suits, during, the, job, interview, process, an,

pin, stripe, pattern, the, style, of, an, interview, suit, however, will, depend, on, the, organizational, culture, of, the, industry, in, which, a, person, seeks, employment, in, the, southwestern, united, states, men, s, suits, often, feature, detailing, inspired, by, traditional, western, wear, such, as, a, pointed, yoke, and, arrow, pockets, suit, coats, similar, in, appearance, to, the, ike, jacket, are, also, widespread, and, it, is, common, practice, to, wear, cowboy, boots, instead, of, conventional, dress, shoes, country, music, singers, and, modern, pop, stars, like, post, malone, or, brandon, flowers, of, the, killers, sometimes, wear, flashy, nudie, suits, with, rhinestones, and, intricate, embroidery, in, modern, society, men, s, suits, have, become, less, common, as, an, outfit, of, daily, wear, during, the, 1990s, driven, in, part, by, the, meteoric, rise, of, newly, successful, technology, companies, with, different, cultural, attitudes, the, prevailing, management, philosophy, of, the, time, moved, in, favour, of, more, casual, attire, for, employees, the, aim, was, to, encourage, a, sense, of, openness, and, egalitarianism, business, casual, dress, still, tends, to, be, the, norm, for, most, workers, up, to, and, sometimes, including, mid, level, management, traditional, business, dress, as, an, everyday, style, has, been, prevalent, in, middle, and, upper, level, corporate, management, now, sometimes, collectively, referred, to, as, suits, and, the, professions, particularly, law, over, time, suits, have, become, less, common, at, the, executive, level, aside, for, job, candidates, and, formal, events, remaining, in, widespread, use, at, other, lives, such, as, among, middle, class, hotel, clerks, and, salespeople, casual, dress, has, also, become, common, in, western, academic, institutions, with, traditional, business, attire, falling, in, popularity, for, many, men, who, do, not, wear, suits, for, work, particularly, in, western, society, wearing, a, suit, is, reserved, for, special, occasions, such, as, weddings, funerals, court, appearances, and, other, more, formal, social, events, hence, because, they, are, not, a, daily, outfit, for, most, men, they, are, often, viewed, as, being, stuffy, and, uncomfortable, the, combination, of, a, tie, belt, and, waistcoat, can, be, tight, and, restrictive, compared, to, contemporary, casual, wear, especially, when, these, are, purchased, at, minimal, cost, and, quality, for, rare, occasions, rather, than, being, made, to, be, worn, comfortably, this, tendency, became, prevalent, enough, that, the, christian, science, monitor, reported, that, a, heavy, jacket, combined, with, a, necktie, and, flimsy, slacks, was, a, design, that, guarantees, that, its, wearer, will, be, uncomfortable, at, any, temperature, during, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, men, s, suits, became, less, commonly, worn, in, much, the, same, way, that, skirts, and, dresses, were, dropped, by, many, women, in, favour, of, trousers, this, was, seen, as, a, liberation, from, the, conformity, of, earlier, periods, and, occurred, concurrently, with, the, women, s, liberation, movement, also, remarkable, is, that, the, suit, now, frequently, appears, in, rock, heavy, metal, and, gothic, happenings, even, though, such, groups, were, once, known, for, a, rather, rebellious, tradition, of, clothing, artists, and, bands, such, as, nick, cave, interpol, marilyn, manson, blutengel, and, akercocke, are, known, for, the, use, of, formal, clothing, in, music, videos, and,

citizens, to, wear, the, mao, suit, due, to, its, egalitarian, and, utilitarian, design, after, the, independence, of, india, there, was, a, backlash, against, western, fashions, due, to, their, association, with, the, previous, colonialist, regime, instead, professional, indian, men, began, wearing, the, five, button, nehru, suit, made, from, khadi, to, support, the, local, textile, industry, during, the, 1960s, these, suits, became, fashionable, among, the, british, mod, subculture, due, to, their, use, by, the, beatles, these, made, a, brief, comeback, during, the, mid, 2000s,
