the, loincloth, is, the, simplest, form, of, underwear, it, was, probably, the, first, undergarment, worn, by, human, beings, in, warmer, climates, the, loincloth, was, often, the, only, clothing, worn, effectively, making, it, an, outer, garment, rather, than, an, undergarment, as, was, doubtless, its, origin, but, in, colder, regions, the, loincloth, often, formed, the, basis, of, a, person, s, clothing, and, was, covered, by, other, garments, in, most, ancient, civilizations, this, was, the, only, undergarment, available, a, loincloth, may, take, three, major, forms, the, first, and, simplest, is, simply, a, long, strip, of, material, that, is, passed, between, the, legs, and, then, around, the, waist, archaeologists, have, found, the, remains, of, such, loincloths, made, of, leather, dating, back, 7, 000, years, the, ancient, hawaiian, malo, was, of, this, form, as, are, several, styles, of, the, japanese, fundoshi, another, form, is, usually, called, a, cache, sexe, a,

a, girdle, men, are, said, to, have, worn, loincloths, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, though, it, is, unclear, whether, greek, women, wore, undergarments, there, is, some, speculation, that, only, slaves, wore, loincloths, and, that, citizens, did, not, wear, undergarments, beneath, their, chitons, mosaics, of, the, roman, period, indicate, that, women, primarily, in, an, athletic, context, whilst, wearing, nothing, else, sometimes, wore, strophiae, breastcloths, or, brassieres, made, of, soft, leather, along, with, subligacula, which, were, either, in, the, form, of, shorts, or,

symbol, of, beauty, and, the, corsets, were, stiffened, with, whalebone, or, steel, to, accomplish, this, while, tight, lacing, of, corsets, was, not, a, common, practice, except, among, a, minority, of, women, which, sometimes, led, to, a, woman, needing, to, retire, to, the, fainting, room, the, primary, use, of, a, corset, was, to, create, a, smooth, line, for, the, garments, to, effect, the,
