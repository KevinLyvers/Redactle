coffee, is, a, beverage, brewed, from, roasted, coffee, beans, darkly, colored, bitter, and, slightly, acidic, coffee, has, a, stimulating, effect, on, humans, primarily, due, to, its, caffeine, content, it, has, the, highest, sales, in, the, world, market, for, hot, drinks, coffee, production, begins, when, the, seeds, of, the, coffea, plant, s, fruits, coffee, cherries, are, separated, to, produce, unroasted, green, coffee, beans, the, beans, are, roasted, and, then, ground, into, fine, particles, coffee, is, brewed, from, the, ground, roasted, beans, which, are, typically, steeped, in, hot, water, before, being, filtered, out, it, is, usually, served, hot, although, chilled, or, iced, coffee, is, common, coffee, can, be, prepared, and, presented, in, a, variety, of, ways, e, g, espresso, french, press, caff, latte, or, already, brewed, canned, coffee, sugar, sugar, substitutes, milk, and, cream, are, often, added, to, mask, the, bitter, taste, or, enhance, the, flavor, there, are, also, various, coffee, substitutes, though, coffee, is, now, a, global, commodity, it, has, a, long, history, tied, closely, to, food, traditions, around, the, red, sea, the, earliest, credible, evidence, of, coffee, drinking, as, the, modern, beverage, appears, in, modern, day, yemen, in, southern, arabia, in, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, in, sufi, shrines, where, coffee, seeds, were, first, roasted, and, brewed, in, a, manner, similar, to, how, it, is, now, prepared, for, drinking, the, coffee, beans, were, procured, by, the, yemenis, from, the, ethiopian, highlands, via, coastal, somali, intermediaries, and, cultivated, in, yemen, by, the, 16th, century, the, drink, had, reached, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, later, spreading, to, europe, the, two, most, commonly, grown, coffee, bean, types, are, c, arabica, and, c, robusta, coffee, plants, are, cultivated, in, over, 70, countries, primarily, in, the, equatorial, regions, of, the, americas, southeast, asia, the, indian, subcontinent, and, africa, green, unroasted, coffee, is, traded, as, an, agricultural, commodity, the, global, coffee, industry, is, massive, and, worth, 495, 50, billion, as, of, 2023, in, the, same, year, brazil, was, the, leading, grower, of, coffee, beans, producing, 35, of, the, world, s, total, followed, by, vietnam, and, colombia, while, coffee, sales, reach, billions, of, dollars, annually, worldwide, coffee, farmers, disproportionately, live, in, poverty, critics, of, the, coffee, industry, have, also, pointed, to, its, negative, impact, on, the, environment, and, the, clearing, of, land, for, coffee, growing, and, water, use, the, word, coffee, entered, the, english, language, in, 1582, via, the, dutch, koffie, borrowed, from, the, ottoman, turkish, kahve, borrowed, in, turn, from, the, arabic, qahwah, medieval, arab, lexicographers, traditionally, held, that, the, etymology, of, qahwah, meant, wine, given, its, distinctly, dark, color, and, was, derived, from, the, verb, qahiya, to, have, no, appetite, the, word, qahwah, most, likely, meant, the, dark, one, referring, to, the, brew, or, the, bean, qahwah, is, not, the, name, of, the, bean, which, are, known, in, arabic, as, bunn, and, in, cushitic, languages, as, b, n, semitic, languages, have, the, root, qhh, dark, color, which, became, a, natural, designation, for, the, beverage, its, cognates, include, the, hebrew, qehe, h, dulling, and, the, aramaic, qahey, give, acrid, taste, to, although, etymologists, have, connected, it, with, a, word, meaning, wine, it, is, also, thought, to, be, from, the, kaffa, region, of, ethiopia, the, terms, coffee, pot, and, coffee, break, originated, in, 1705, and, 1952, respectively, there, are, multiple, anecdotal, origin, stories, which, lack, evidence, in, a, commonly, repeated, legend, kaldi, a, 9th, century, ethiopian, goatherd, first, observed, the, coffee, plant, after, seeing, his, flock, energized, by, chewing, on, the, plant, this, legend, does, not, appear, before, 1671, first, being, related, by, antoine, faustus, nairon, a, maronite, professor, of, oriental, languages, and, author, of, one, of, the, first, printed, treatises, devoted, to, coffee, de, saluberrima, potione, cahue, seu, cafe, nuncupata, discurscus, rome, 1671, indicating, the, story, is, likely, apocryphal, another, legend, attributes, the, discovery, of, coffee, to, a, sheikh, omar, starving, after, being, exiled, from, mokha, a, port, city, in, what, is, now, yemen, omar, found, berries, after, attempting, to, chew, and, roast, them, omar, boiled, them, which, yielded, a, liquid, that, revitalized, and, sustained, him, the, earliest, credible, evidence, of, coffee, drinking, or, knowledge, of, the, coffee, tree, appears, in, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, in, the, accounts, of, ahmed, al, ghaffar, in, yemen, where, coffee, seeds, were, first, roasted, and, brewed, in, a, similar, way, to, how, it, is, prepared, now, coffee, was, used, by, sufi, circles, to, stay, awake, for, their, religious, rituals, accounts, differ, on, the, origin, of, the, coffee, plant, before, its, appearance, in, yemen, from, ethiopia, coffee, could, have, been, introduced, to, yemen, via, trade, across, the, red, sea, one, account, credits, muhammad, ibn, sa, d, for, bringing, the, beverage, to, aden, from, the, african, coast, other, early, accounts, say, ali, ben, omar, of, the, shadhili, sufi, order, was, the, first, to, introduce, coffee, to, arabia, 16th, century, islamic, scholar, ibn, hajar, al, haytami, notes, in, his, writings, that, a, beverage, called, qahwa, developed, from, a, tree, in, the, zeila, region, located, in, the, horn, of, africa, coffee, was, first, exported, from, ethiopia, to, yemen, by, somali, merchants, from, berbera, and, zeila, in, modern, day, somaliland, which, was, procured, from, harar, and, the, abyssinian, interior, according, to, captain, haines, who, was, the, colonial, administrator, of, aden, 1839, 1854, mokha, historically, imported, up, to, two, thirds, of, its, coffee, from, berbera, based, merchants, before, the, coffee, trade, of, mokha, was, captured, by, british, controlled, aden, in, the, 19th, century, after, that, much, of, the, ethiopian, coffee, was, exported, to, aden, via, berbera, by, the, 16th, century, coffee, had, reached, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, the, first, coffee, seeds, were, smuggled, out, of, the, middle, east, by, sufi, baba, budan, from, yemen, to, india, during, the, time, before, then, all, exported, coffee, was, boiled, or, otherwise, sterilized, portraits, of, baba, budan, depict, him, as, having, smuggled, seven, coffee, seeds, by, strapping, them, to, his, chest, the, first, plants, from, these, smuggled, seeds, were, planted, in, mysore, coffee, had, spread, to, italy, by, 1600, and, then, to, the, rest, of, europe, indonesia, and, the, americas, in, 1583, leonhard, rauwolf, a, german, physician, gave, this, description, of, coffee, after, returning, from, a, ten, year, trip, to, the, near, east, a, beverage, as, black, as, ink, useful, against, numerous, illnesses, particularly, those, of, the, stomach, its, consumers, take, it, in, the, morning, quite, frankly, in, a, porcelain, cup, passed, around, and, from, which, each, one, drinks, a, cupful, it, is, composed, of, water, and, the, fruit, from, a, bush, called, bunnu, thriving, trade, brought, many, goods, including, coffee, from, the, ottoman, empire, to, venice, from, there, it, was, introduced, to, the, rest, of, europe, coffee, became, more, widely, accepted, after, it, was, deemed, a, christian, beverage, by, pope, clement, viii, in, 1600, despite, appeals, to, ban, the, muslim, drink, the, first, european, coffee, house, opened, in, venice, in, 1647, the, dutch, east, india, company, was, the, first, to, import, coffee, on, a, large, scale, the, dutch, later, grew, the, crop, in, java, and, ceylon, the, first, exports, of, indonesian, coffee, from, java, to, the, netherlands, occurred, in, 1711, through, the, efforts, of, the, british, east, india, company, coffee, also, became, popular, in, england, in, a, diary, entry, of, may, 1637, john, evelyn, recorded, tasting, the, drink, at, oxford, in, england, where, it, had, been, brought, by, a, student, of, balliol, college, from, crete, named, nathaniel, conopios, of, crete, oxford, s, queen, s, lane, coffee, house, established, in, 1654, is, still, in, existence, today, coffee, was, introduced, in, france, in, 1657, and, in, austria, and, poland, after, the, 1683, battle, of, vienna, when, coffee, was, captured, from, supplies, of, the, defeated, turks, when, coffee, reached, north, america, during, the, colonial, period, it, was, initially, not, as, successful, as, in, europe, as, alcoholic, beverages, remained, more, popular, during, the, revolutionary, war, the, demand, for, coffee, increased, so, much, that, dealers, had, to, hoard, their, scarce, supplies, and, raise, prices, dramatically, this, was, also, due, to, the, reduced, availability, of, tea, from, british, merchants, and, a, general, resolution, among, many, americans, to, avoid, drinking, tea, following, the, 1773, boston, tea, party, during, the, 18th, century, coffee, consumption, declined, in, britain, giving, way, to, tea, drinking, tea, was, simpler, to, make, and, had, become, cheaper, with, the, british, conquest, of, india, and, the, tea, industry, there, during, the, age, of, sail, seamen, aboard, ships, of, the, british, royal, navy, made, substitute, coffee, by, dissolving, burnt, bread, in, hot, water, the, frenchman, gabriel, de, clieu, took, a, coffee, plant, to, the, french, territory, of, martinique, in, the, caribbean, in, the, 1720s, from, which, much, of, the, world, s, cultivated, arabica, coffee, is, descended, coffee, thrived, in, the, climate, and, was, conveyed, across, the, americas, coffee, was, cultivated, in, saint, domingue, now, haiti, from, 1734, and, by, 1788, it, supplied, half, the, world, s, coffee, the, conditions, that, the, enslaved, people, worked, in, on, coffee, plantations, were, a, factor, in, the, soon, to, follow, haitian, revolution, the, coffee, industry, never, fully, recovered, there, meanwhile, coffee, had, been, introduced, to, brazil, in, 1727, although, its, cultivation, did, not, gather, momentum, until, independence, in, 1822, after, this, time, massive, tracts, of, rainforest, were, cleared, for, coffee, plantations, first, in, the, vicinity, of, rio, de, janeiro, and, later, s, o, paulo, brazil, went, from, having, essentially, no, coffee, exports, in, 1800, to, being, a, significant, regional, producer, in, 1830, to, being, the, largest, producer, in, the, world, by, 1852, in, 1910, 1920, brazil, exported, around, 70, of, the, world, s, coffee, colombia, guatemala, and, venezuela, exported, 15, and, old, world, production, accounted, for, less, than, 5, of, world, exports, many, countries, in, central, america, took, up, cultivation, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, almost, all, were, involved, in, the, large, scale, displacement, and, exploitation, of, the, indigenous, people, harsh, conditions, led, to, many, uprisings, coups, and, bloody, suppression, of, peasants, the, notable, exception, was, costa, rica, where, lack, of, ready, labor, prevented, the, formation, of, large, farms, smaller, farms, and, more, egalitarian, conditions, ameliorated, unrest, over, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, rapid, growth, in, coffee, production, in, south, america, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, was, matched, by, an, increase, in, consumption, in, developed, countries, though, nowhere, has, this, growth, been, as, pronounced, as, in, the, united, states, where, a, high, rate, of, population, growth, was, compounded, by, doubling, of, per, capita, consumption, between, 1860, and, 1920, though, the, united, states, was, not, the, heaviest, coffee, drinking, nation, at, the, time, belgium, the, netherlands, and, nordic, countries, all, had, comparable, or, higher, levels, of, per, capita, consumption, due, to, its, sheer, size, it, was, already, the, largest, consumer, of, coffee, in, the, world, by, 1860, and, by, 1920, around, half, of, all, coffee, produced, worldwide, was, consumed, in, the, us, coffee, has, become, a, vital, cash, crop, for, many, developing, countries, over, one, hundred, million, people, in, developing, countries, have, become, dependent, on, coffee, as, their, primary, source, of, income, it, has, become, the, primary, export, and, economic, backbone, for, african, countries, like, uganda, burundi, rwanda, and, ethiopia, as, well, as, many, central, american, countries, several, species, of, shrub, of, the, genus, coffea, produce, the, berries, from, which, coffee, is, extracted, the, two, main, species, commercially, cultivated, are, coffea, canephora, predominantly, a, form, known, as, robusta, and, c, arabica, c, arabica, the, most, highly, regarded, species, is, native, to, the, southwestern, highlands, of, ethiopia, and, the, boma, plateau, in, southeastern, sudan, and, mount, marsabit, in, northern, kenya, c, canephora, is, native, to, western, and, central, subsaharan, africa, from, guinea, to, uganda, and, southern, sudan, less, popular, species, are, c, liberica, c, stenophylla, c, mauritiana, and, c, racemosa, all, coffee, plants, are, classified, in, the, large, family, rubiaceae, they, are, evergreen, shrubs, or, trees, that, may, grow, 5, m, 15, ft, tall, when, unpruned, the, leaves, are, dark, green, and, glossy, usually, 10, 15, cm, 4, 6, in, long, and, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, wide, simple, entire, and, opposite, petioles, of, opposite, leaves, fuse, at, the, base, to, form, interpetiolar, stipules, characteristic, of, rubiaceae, the, flowers, are, axillary, and, clusters, of, fragrant, white, flowers, bloom, simultaneously, gynoecium, consists, of, an, inferior, ovary, also, characteristic, of, rubiaceae, the, flowers, are, followed, by, oval, berries, of, about, 1, 5, cm, 0, 6, in, when, immature, they, are, green, and, they, ripen, to, yellow, then, crimson, before, turning, black, on, drying, each, berry, usually, contains, two, seeds, but, 5, 10, of, the, berries, have, only, one, these, are, called, peaberries, arabica, berries, ripen, in, six, to, eight, months, while, robusta, takes, nine, to, eleven, months, coffea, arabica, is, predominantly, self, pollinating, and, as, a, result, the, seedlings, are, generally, uniform, and, vary, little, from, their, parents, in, contrast, coffea, canephora, and, c, liberica, are, self, incompatible, and, require, outcrossing, this, means, that, useful, forms, and, hybrids, must, be, propagated, vegetatively, cuttings, grafting, and, budding, are, the, usual, methods, of, vegetative, propagation, on, the, other, hand, there, is, great, scope, for, experimentation, in, search, of, potential, new, strains, the, traditional, method, of, planting, coffee, is, to, place, 20, seeds, in, each, hole, at, the, beginning, of, the, rainy, season, this, method, loses, about, 50, of, the, seeds, potential, as, about, half, fail, to, sprout, a, more, effective, process, of, growing, coffee, used, in, brazil, is, to, raise, seedlings, in, nurseries, that, are, then, planted, outside, after, six, to, twelve, months, coffee, is, often, intercropped, with, food, crops, such, as, corn, beans, or, rice, during, the, first, few, years, of, cultivation, as, farmers, become, familiar, with, its, requirements, coffee, plants, grow, within, a, defined, area, between, the, tropics, of, cancer, and, capricorn, termed, the, bean, belt, or, coffee, belt, in, 2020, the, world, production, of, green, coffee, beans, was, 175, 647, 000, 60, kg, bags, led, by, brazil, with, 39, of, the, total, followed, by, vietnam, colombia, and, indonesia, brazil, is, the, largest, coffee, exporting, nation, accounting, for, 15, of, all, world, exports, in, 2019, as, of, 2021, no, synthetic, coffee, products, are, publicly, available, but, multiple, bioeconomy, companies, have, reportedly, produced, first, batches, that, are, highly, similar, on, the, molecular, level, and, are, close, to, commercialization, of, the, two, main, species, grown, arabica, coffee, from, c, arabica, is, generally, more, highly, regarded, than, robusta, coffee, from, c, canephora, robusta, coffee, tends, to, be, bitter, and, has, less, flavor, but, a, better, body, than, arabica, for, these, reasons, about, three, quarters, of, coffee, cultivated, worldwide, is, c, arabica, robusta, strains, also, contain, about, 40, 50, more, caffeine, than, arabica, consequently, this, species, is, used, as, an, inexpensive, substitute, for, arabica, in, many, commercial, coffee, blends, good, quality, robusta, beans, are, used, in, traditional, italian, espresso, blends, to, provide, a, full, bodied, taste, and, a, better, foam, head, known, as, crema, additionally, robusta, is, less, susceptible, to, disease, than, arabica, and, can, be, cultivated, in, lower, altitudes, and, warmer, climates, where, arabica, does, not, thrive, the, robusta, strain, was, first, collected, in, 1890, from, the, lomani, river, a, tributary, of, the, congo, river, and, was, conveyed, from, the, congo, free, state, now, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, to, brussels, to, java, around, 1900, from, java, further, breeding, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, robusta, plantations, in, many, countries, in, particular, the, spread, of, the, devastating, coffee, leaf, rust, caused, by, the, fungal, pathogen, hemileia, vastatrix, to, which, arabica, is, vulnerable, hastened, the, uptake, of, the, resistant, robusta, the, pathogen, and, results, in, light, rust, colored, spots, on, the, undersides, of, coffee, plant, leaves, it, grows, exclusively, on, the, leaves, of, coffee, plants, coffee, leaf, rust, is, found, in, virtually, all, countries, that, produce, coffee, beans, from, different, countries, or, regions, can, usually, be, distinguished, by, differences, in, flavor, aroma, body, and, acidity, these, taste, characteristics, are, dependent, not, only, on, the, coffee, s, growing, region, but, also, on, genetic, subspecies, varietals, and, processing, varietals, are, generally, known, by, the, region, in, which, they, are, grown, such, as, colombian, java, and, kona, arabica, coffee, beans, are, cultivated, mainly, in, latin, america, eastern, africa, or, asia, while, robusta, beans, are, grown, in, central, africa, southeast, asia, and, brazil, coffee, can, also, be, blended, with, medicinal, or, functional, mushrooms, of, which, some, of, the, most, frequently, used, include, lion, s, mane, chaga, cordyceps, and, reishi, mushroom, coffee, has, about, half, the, caffeine, of, standard, coffee, however, drinking, mushroom, coffee, can, result, in, digestive, issues, and, high, amounts, can, result, in, liver, toxicity, there, is, little, clinical, evidence, for, the, benefits, of, mushroom, coffee, coffee, wilt, disease, or, tracheomycosis, is, a, common, vascular, wilt, found, in, eastern, and, central, africa, that, can, kill, coffee, trees, it, infects, it, is, induced, by, the, fungal, pathogen, gibberella, xylarioides, it, can, affect, several, coffea, species, and, could, potentially, threaten, production, worldwide, mycena, citricolor, american, leaf, spot, is, a, fungus, that, can, affect, the, whole, coffee, plant, it, grows, on, leaves, resulting, in, leaves, with, holes, that, often, fall, from, the, plant, it, is, a, threat, primarily, in, latin, america, over, 900, species, of, insect, have, been, recorded, as, pests, of, coffee, crops, worldwide, of, these, over, a, third, are, beetles, and, over, a, quarter, are, bugs, some, 20, species, of, nematodes, 9, species, of, mites, and, several, snails, and, slugs, also, attack, the, crop, birds, and, rodents, sometimes, eat, coffee, berries, but, their, impact, is, minor, compared, to, invertebrates, in, general, arabica, is, the, more, sensitive, species, to, invertebrate, predation, overall, each, part, of, the, coffee, plant, is, assailed, by, different, animals, nematodes, attack, the, roots, coffee, borer, beetles, burrow, into, stems, and, woody, material, and, the, foliage, is, attacked, by, over, 100, species, of, larvae, caterpillars, of, butterflies, and, moths, mass, spraying, of, insecticides, has, often, proven, disastrous, as, predators, of, the, pests, are, more, sensitive, than, the, pests, themselves, instead, integrated, pest, management, has, developed, using, techniques, such, as, targeted, treatment, of, pest, outbreaks, and, managing, crop, environment, away, from, conditions, favoring, pests, branches, infested, with, scale, are, often, cut, and, left, on, the, ground, which, causes, scale, parasites, to, not, only, attack, the, scale, on, the, fallen, branches, but, in, the, plant, as, well, the, 2, mm, long, coffee, borer, beetle, hypothenemus, hampei, is, the, most, damaging, insect, pest, of, the, world, s, coffee, industry, destroying, up, to, 50, percent, or, more, of, the, coffee, berries, on, plantations, in, most, coffee, producing, countries, the, adult, female, beetle, nibbles, a, single, tiny, hole, in, a, coffee, berry, and, lays, 35, to, 50, eggs, inside, the, offspring, grow, mate, and, then, emerge, from, the, commercially, ruined, berry, to, disperse, repeating, the, cycle, pesticides, are, mostly, ineffective, because, the, beetle, juveniles, are, protected, inside, the, berry, nurseries, but, they, are, vulnerable, to, predation, by, birds, when, they, emerge, when, groves, of, trees, are, nearby, the, american, yellow, warbler, rufous, capped, warbler, and, other, insectivorous, birds, have, been, shown, to, reduce, by, 50, percent, the, number, of, coffee, berry, borers, in, costa, rica, coffee, plantations, originally, coffee, was, grown, in, the, shade, of, trees, that, provided, a, habitat, for, many, animals, and, insects, remnant, forest, trees, were, used, for, this, purpose, but, many, species, have, been, planted, as, well, these, include, leguminous, trees, of, the, genera, acacia, albizia, cassia, erythrina, gliricidia, inga, and, leucaena, as, well, as, the, nitrogen, fixing, non, legume, sheoaks, of, the, genus, casuarina, and, the, silky, oak, grevillea, robusta, this, method, is, commonly, called, shade, grown, coffee, starting, in, the, 1970s, many, farmers, switched, their, production, method, to, sun, cultivation, in, which, coffee, is, grown, in, rows, under, full, sun, with, little, or, no, forest, canopy, this, causes, berries, to, ripen, more, rapidly, and, bushes, to, produce, higher, yields, but, requires, the, clearing, of, trees, and, increased, use, of, fertilizer, and, pesticides, which, damage, the, environment, and, cause, health, problems, unshaded, coffee, plants, grown, with, fertilizer, yield, the, most, coffee, although, unfertilized, shaded, crops, generally, yield, more, than, unfertilized, unshaded, crops, the, response, to, fertilizer, is, much, greater, in, full, sun, while, traditional, coffee, production, causes, berries, to, ripen, more, slowly, and, produce, lower, yields, the, quality, of, the, coffee, is, allegedly, superior, in, addition, the, traditional, shaded, method, provides, living, space, for, many, wildlife, species, proponents, of, shade, cultivation, say, environmental, problems, such, as, deforestation, pesticide, pollution, habitat, destruction, and, soil, and, water, degradation, are, the, side, effects, of, the, practices, employed, in, sun, cultivation, the, american, birding, association, smithsonian, migratory, bird, center, national, arbor, day, foundation, and, the, rainforest, alliance, have, led, a, campaign, for, shade, grown, and, organic, coffees, which, can, be, sustainably, harvested, shaded, coffee, cultivation, systems, show, greater, biodiversity, than, full, sun, systems, and, those, more, distant, from, continuous, forest, compare, rather, poorly, to, undisturbed, native, forest, in, terms, of, habitat, value, for, some, bird, species, coffee, production, uses, a, large, volume, of, water, on, average, it, takes, about, 140, litres, 37, us, gal, of, water, to, grow, the, coffee, beans, needed, to, produce, one, cup, of, coffee, growing, the, plants, needed, to, produce, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, of, roasted, coffee, in, africa, south, america, or, asia, requires, 26, 400, litres, 7, 000, us, gal, of, water, as, with, many, other, forms, of, agriculture, often, much, of, this, is, rainwater, much, of, which, would, otherwise, run, off, into, rivers, or, coastlines, while, much, water, actually, absorbed, by, the, plants, is, transpired, straight, back, into, the, local, environment, through, the, plants, leaves, especially, for, cooling, effects, broad, estimates, aside, consequential, margins, vary, considerably, based, on, details, of, local, geography, and, horticultural, practice, coffee, is, often, grown, in, countries, where, there, is, a, water, shortage, such, as, ethiopia, used, coffee, grounds, may, be, used, for, composting, or, as, a, mulch, they, are, especially, appreciated, by, worms, and, acid, loving, plants, such, as, blueberries, climate, change, may, significantly, impact, coffee, yields, during, the, 21st, century, such, as, in, nicaragua, and, ethiopia, which, could, lose, more, than, half, of, the, farming, land, suitable, for, growing, arabica, coffee, as, of, 2016, at, least, 34, of, global, coffee, production, was, compliant, with, voluntary, sustainability, standards, such, as, fairtrade, utz, and, 4c, the, common, code, for, the, coffee, community, coffee, berries, are, traditionally, selectively, picked, by, hand, which, is, labor, intensive, as, it, involves, the, selection, of, only, the, berries, at, the, peak, of, ripeness, more, commonly, crops, are, strip, picked, where, all, berries, are, harvested, simultaneously, regardless, of, ripeness, by, person, or, machine, after, picking, green, coffee, is, processed, by, one, of, two, types, of, method, a, dry, process, method, which, is, often, simpler, and, less, labor, intensive, and, a, wet, process, method, which, incorporates, batch, fermentation, uses, larger, amounts, of, water, in, the, process, and, often, yields, a, milder, coffee, then, they, are, sorted, by, ripeness, and, color, and, most, often, the, flesh, of, the, berry, is, removed, usually, by, machine, and, the, seeds, are, fermented, to, remove, the, slimy, layer, of, mucilage, still, present, on, the, seed, when, the, fermentation, is, finished, the, seeds, are, washed, with, large, quantities, of, fresh, water, to, remove, the, fermentation, residue, which, generates, massive, amounts, of, coffee, wastewater, finally, the, seeds, are, dried, the, best, but, least, used, method, of, drying, coffee, is, using, drying, tables, in, this, method, the, pulped, and, fermented, coffee, is, spread, thinly, on, raised, beds, which, allows, the, air, to, pass, on, all, sides, of, the, coffee, and, then, the, coffee, is, mixed, by, hand, the, drying, that, then, takes, place, is, more, uniform, and, fermentation, is, less, likely, most, african, coffee, is, dried, in, this, manner, and, certain, coffee, farms, around, the, world, are, starting, to, use, this, traditional, method, next, the, coffee, is, sorted, and, labeled, as, green, coffee, some, companies, use, cylinders, to, pump, in, heated, air, to, dry, the, coffee, seeds, though, this, is, generally, in, places, where, the, humidity, is, very, high, an, asian, coffee, known, as, kopi, luwak, undergoes, a, peculiar, process, made, from, coffee, berries, eaten, by, the, asian, palm, civet, passing, through, its, digestive, tract, with, the, beans, eventually, harvested, from, feces, coffee, brewed, from, this, process, is, among, the, most, expensive, in, the, world, with, bean, prices, reaching, 160, per, pound, or, 30, per, brewed, cup, kopi, luwak, coffee, is, said, to, have, a, uniquely, rich, slightly, smoky, aroma, and, flavor, with, hints, of, chocolate, resulting, from, the, action, of, digestive, enzymes, breaking, down, bean, proteins, to, facilitate, partial, fermentation, in, thailand, black, ivory, coffee, beans, are, fed, to, elephants, whose, digestive, enzymes, reduce, the, bitter, taste, of, beans, collected, from, dung, these, beans, sell, for, up, to, 1, 100, a, kilogram, 500, per, lb, achieving, the, world, s, most, expensive, coffee, three, times, costlier, than, palm, civet, coffee, beans, the, next, step, in, the, process, is, the, roasting, of, green, coffee, coffee, is, usually, sold, in, a, roasted, state, and, with, rare, exceptions, such, as, infusions, from, green, coffee, beans, coffee, is, roasted, before, it, is, consumed, it, can, be, sold, roasted, by, the, supplier, or, it, can, be, home, roasted, the, roasting, process, influences, the, taste, of, the, beverage, by, changing, the, coffee, bean, both, physically, and, chemically, the, bean, decreases, in, weight, as, moisture, is, lost, and, increases, in, volume, causing, it, to, become, less, dense, the, density, of, the, bean, also, influences, the, strength, of, the, coffee, and, the, requirements, for, packaging, the, actual, roasting, begins, when, the, temperature, inside, the, bean, reaches, approximately, 200, c, 392, f, though, different, varieties, of, seeds, differ, in, moisture, and, density, and, therefore, roast, at, different, rates, during, roasting, caramelization, occurs, as, intense, heat, breaks, down, starches, changing, them, to, simple, sugars, that, begin, to, brown, which, darkens, the, color, of, the, bean, sucrose, is, rapidly, lost, during, the, roasting, process, and, may, disappear, entirely, in, darker, roasts, during, roasting, aromatic, oils, and, acids, weaken, changing, the, flavor, at, 205, c, 401, f, other, oils, start, to, develop, one, of, these, oils, caffeol, is, created, at, about, 200, c, 392, f, and, is, largely, responsible, for, coffee, s, aroma, and, flavor, the, difference, of, caffeine, content, between, a, light, roast, and, a, dark, roast, is, only, about, 0, 1, depending, on, the, color, of, the, roasted, beans, as, perceived, by, the, human, eye, they, will, be, labeled, as, light, medium, light, medium, medium, dark, dark, or, very, dark, a, more, accurate, method, of, discerning, the, degree, of, roast, involves, measuring, the, reflected, light, from, roasted, seeds, illuminated, with, a, light, source, in, the, near, infrared, spectrum, this, elaborate, light, meter, uses, a, process, known, as, spectroscopy, to, return, a, number, that, consistently, indicates, the, roasted, coffee, s, relative, degree, of, roast, or, flavor, development, coffee, has, in, many, countries, been, graded, by, size, longer, than, it, has, been, graded, by, quality, grading, is, generally, done, with, sieves, numbered, to, indicate, the, size, of, the, perforations, the, degree, of, roast, affects, coffee, flavor, and, body, the, color, of, coffee, after, brewing, is, also, affected, by, the, degree, of, roasting, darker, roasts, are, generally, bolder, because, they, have, less, fiber, content, and, a, more, sugary, flavor, lighter, roasts, have, a, more, complex, and, therefore, perceived, stronger, flavor, from, aromatic, oils, and, acids, otherwise, destroyed, by, longer, roasting, times, roasting, does, not, alter, the, amount, of, caffeine, in, the, bean, but, does, give, less, caffeine, when, the, beans, are, measured, by, volume, because, the, beans, expand, during, roasting, a, small, amount, of, chaff, is, produced, during, roasting, from, the, skin, left, on, the, seed, after, processing, chaff, is, usually, removed, from, the, seeds, by, air, movement, though, a, small, amount, is, added, to, dark, roast, coffees, to, soak, up, oils, on, the, seeds, decaffeination, of, coffee, seeds, is, done, while, the, seeds, are, still, green, many, methods, can, remove, caffeine, from, coffee, but, all, involve, either, soaking, the, green, seeds, in, hot, water, often, called, the, swiss, water, process, or, steaming, them, then, using, a, solvent, to, dissolve, caffeine, containing, oils, decaffeination, is, often, done, by, processing, companies, and, the, extracted, caffeine, is, usually, sold, to, the, pharmaceutical, industry, coffee, is, best, stored, in, an, airtight, container, made, of, ceramic, glass, or, non, reactive, metal, higher, quality, prepackaged, coffee, usually, has, a, one, way, valve, that, prevents, air, from, entering, while, allowing, the, coffee, to, release, gases, coffee, freshness, and, flavor, is, preserved, when, it, is, stored, away, from, moisture, heat, and, light, the, tendency, of, coffee, to, absorb, strong, smells, from, food, means, that, it, should, be, kept, away, from, such, smells, storage, of, coffee, in, refrigerators, is, not, recommended, due, to, the, presence, of, moisture, which, can, cause, deterioration, exterior, walls, of, buildings, that, face, the, sun, may, heat, the, interior, of, a, home, and, this, heat, may, damage, coffee, stored, near, such, a, wall, heat, from, nearby, ovens, also, harms, stored, coffee, in, 1931, a, method, of, packing, coffee, in, a, sealed, vacuum, in, cans, was, introduced, the, roasted, coffee, was, packed, and, then, 99, of, the, air, was, removed, allowing, the, coffee, to, be, stored, indefinitely, until, the, can, was, opened, today, this, method, is, in, mass, use, for, coffee, in, a, large, part, of, the, world, coffee, beans, must, be, ground, and, brewed, to, create, a, beverage, the, criteria, for, choosing, a, method, include, flavor, and, economy, almost, all, methods, of, preparing, coffee, require, that, the, beans, be, ground, and, then, mixed, with, hot, water, long, enough, to, allow, the, flavor, to, emerge, but, not, so, long, as, to, draw, out, bitter, compounds, the, liquid, can, be, consumed, after, the, spent, grounds, are, removed, brewing, considerations, include, the, fineness, of, the, grind, how, the, water, is, used, to, extract, the, flavor, the, ratio, of, coffee, grounds, to, water, the, brew, ratio, additional, flavorings, such, as, sugar, milk, and, spices, and, the, technique, to, be, used, to, separate, spent, grounds, optimal, coffee, extraction, occurs, between, 91, and, 96, c, 196, and, 205, f, ideal, holding, temperatures, range, from, 85, to, 88, c, 185, to, 190, f, to, as, high, as, 93, c, 199, f, and, the, ideal, serving, temperature, is, 68, to, 79, c, 154, to, 174, f, coffee, beans, may, be, ground, with, a, burr, grinder, which, uses, revolving, elements, to, shear, the, seed, a, blade, grinder, cuts, the, seeds, with, blades, moving, at, high, speed, and, a, mortar, and, pestle, crush, the, seeds, for, most, brewing, methods, a, burr, grinder, is, deemed, superior, because, the, grind, is, more, even, and, the, grind, size, can, be, adjusted, the, type, of, grind, is, often, named, after, the, brewing, method, for, which, it, is, generally, used, turkish, grind, being, the, finest, while, coffee, percolator, or, french, press, are, the, coarsest, the, most, common, grinds, are, between, these, extremes, a, medium, grind, is, used, in, most, home, coffee, brewing, machines, coffee, may, be, brewed, by, several, methods, it, may, be, boiled, steeped, or, pressurized, brewing, coffee, by, boiling, was, the, earliest, method, and, turkish, coffee, is, an, example, of, this, method, it, is, prepared, by, grinding, or, pounding, the, seeds, to, a, fine, powder, then, adding, it, to, water, and, bringing, it, to, a, boil, for, no, more, than, an, instant, in, a, pot, called, a, cezve, or, in, greek, a, br, ki, from, turkish, ibrik, this, produces, a, strong, coffee, with, a, layer, of, foam, on, the, surface, and, sediment, which, is, not, meant, for, drinking, settling, at, the, bottom, of, the, cup, drip, brewers, and, automatic, coffeemakers, brew, coffee, using, gravity, in, an, automatic, coffeemaker, hot, water, drips, onto, coffee, grounds, that, are, held, in, a, paper, plastic, or, perforated, metal, coffee, filter, allowing, the, water, to, seep, through, the, ground, coffee, while, extracting, its, oils, and, essences, the, liquid, drips, through, the, coffee, and, the, filter, into, a, carafe, or, pot, and, the, spent, coffee, grounds, are, retained, in, the, filter, in, a, coffee, percolator, water, is, pulled, under, a, pipe, by, gravity, which, is, then, forced, into, a, chamber, above, a, filter, by, steam, pressure, created, by, boiling, the, water, then, seeps, through, the, grounds, and, the, process, is, repeated, until, terminated, by, removing, from, the, heat, by, an, internal, timer, or, by, a, thermostat, that, turns, off, the, heater, when, the, entire, pot, reaches, a, certain, temperature, the, espresso, method, forces, hot, pressurized, water, through, finely, ground, coffee, as, a, result, of, brewing, under, high, pressure, typically, 9, bar, the, espresso, beverage, is, more, concentrated, as, much, as, 10, to, 15, times, the, quantity, of, coffee, to, water, as, gravity, brewing, methods, can, produce, and, has, a, more, complex, physical, and, chemical, constitution, a, well, prepared, espresso, has, a, reddish, brown, foam, called, crema, that, floats, on, the, surface, other, pressurized, water, methods, include, the, moka, pot, and, vacuum, coffee, maker, the, aeropress, also, works, similarly, moving, a, column, of, water, through, a, bed, of, coffee, cold, brew, coffee, is, made, by, steeping, coarsely, ground, beans, in, cold, water, for, several, hours, then, filtering, them, this, results, in, a, brew, lower, in, acidity, than, most, hot, brewing, methods, once, brewed, coffee, may, be, served, in, a, variety, of, ways, drip, brewed, percolated, or, french, pressed, cafeti, re, coffee, may, be, served, as, white, coffee, with, a, dairy, product, such, as, milk, or, cream, or, dairy, substitute, or, as, black, coffee, with, no, such, addition, it, may, be, sweetened, with, sugar, or, artificial, sweetener, when, served, cold, it, is, called, iced, coffee, espresso, based, coffee, has, a, variety, of, possible, presentations, in, its, most, basic, form, an, espresso, is, served, alone, as, a, shot, or, short, black, or, with, hot, water, added, when, it, is, known, as, caff, americano, a, long, black, is, made, by, pouring, a, double, espresso, into, an, equal, portion, of, water, retaining, the, crema, unlike, caff, americano, milk, is, added, in, various, forms, to, an, espresso, steamed, milk, makes, a, caff, latte, equal, parts, steamed, milk, and, milk, froth, make, a, cappuccino, and, a, dollop, of, hot, foamed, milk, on, top, creates, a, caff, macchiato, a, flat, white, is, prepared, by, adding, steamed, hot, milk, microfoam, to, two, espresso, shots, it, has, less, milk, than, a, latte, but, both, are, varieties, of, coffee, to, which, the, milk, can, be, added, in, such, a, way, as, to, create, a, decorative, surface, pattern, such, effects, are, known, as, latte, art, coffee, is, frequently, served, iced, popular, options, include, frapp, s, iced, lattes, or, stronger, brewed, coffee, served, with, ice, coffee, can, also, be, incorporated, with, alcohol, to, produce, a, variety, of, beverages, it, is, combined, with, whiskey, in, irish, coffee, and, it, forms, the, base, of, alcoholic, coffee, liqueurs, such, as, kahl, a, and, tia, maria, some, craft, beers, have, coffee, or, coffee, extracts, added, to, the, beer, although, porter, and, stout, beers, may, have, a, coffee, like, taste, solely, due, to, roasted, grains, many, products, are, sold, for, the, convenience, of, consumers, who, do, not, want, to, prepare, their, coffee, or, who, do, not, have, access, to, coffeemaking, equipment, instant, coffee, is, dried, into, soluble, powder, or, freeze, dried, into, granules, that, can, be, quickly, dissolved, in, hot, water, a, new, zealand, invention, and, staple, instant, coffee, was, originally, invented, in, invercargill, 1890, by, food, chemist, david, strang, it, rapidly, gained, in, popularity, in, many, countries, in, the, post, war, period, with, nescaf, being, the, most, popular, product, many, consumers, determined, that, the, convenience, of, preparing, a, cup, of, instant, coffee, more, than, made, up, for, a, perceived, inferior, taste, although, since, the, late, 1970s, instant, coffee, has, been, produced, differently, in, such, a, way, that, is, similar, to, the, taste, of, freshly, brewed, coffee, paralleling, and, complementing, the, rapid, rise, of, instant, coffee, was, the, coffee, vending, machine, invented, in, 1947, and, widely, distributed, since, the, 1950s, over, 90, percent, of, coffee, production, takes, place, in, developing, countries, mainly, south, america, while, consumption, happens, primarily, in, industrialized, economies, there, are, 25, million, small, producers, who, rely, on, coffee, for, a, living, worldwide, in, brazil, where, almost, a, third, of, the, world, s, coffee, is, produced, over, five, million, people, are, employed, in, the, cultivation, and, harvesting, of, over, three, billion, coffee, plants, it, is, a, more, labor, intensive, culture, than, alternative, cultures, of, the, same, regions, such, as, sugar, cane, or, cattle, as, its, cultivation, is, not, automated, requiring, frequent, human, attention, in, 2021, world, production, of, green, coffee, beans, was, 9, 9, million, tonnes, led, by, brazil, with, 30, of, the, total, table, vietnam, indonesia, and, colombia, were, other, major, producers, nearly, 90, countries, export, coffee, cherries, 60, of, them, developing, countries, with, coffee, constituting, the, main, export, revenue, for, countries, such, as, burundi, ethiopia, rwanda, and, formerly, haiti, the, largest, producer, by, far, is, brazil, almost, 30, of, world, production, in, 2015, followed, by, vietnam, colombia, indonesia, and, ethiopia, coffee, production, provides, a, living, for, about, twenty, five, million, people, mainly, small, scale, producers, while, imports, processing, and, distribution, provide, a, living, for, about, one, hundred, to, one, hundred, and, ten, million, people, coffee, is, bought, and, sold, as, green, coffee, beans, by, roasters, investors, and, price, speculators, as, a, tradable, commodity, in, commodity, markets, and, exchange, traded, funds, coffee, futures, contracts, for, grade, 3, washed, arabicas, are, traded, on, the, new, york, mercantile, exchange, under, ticker, symbol, kc, with, contract, deliveries, occurring, every, year, in, march, may, july, september, and, december, higher, and, lower, grade, arabica, coffees, are, sold, through, other, channels, futures, contracts, for, robusta, coffee, are, traded, on, the, london, international, financial, futures, and, options, exchange, and, since, 2007, on, the, new, york, intercontinental, exchange, dating, to, the, 1970s, coffee, has, been, incorrectly, described, by, many, including, historian, mark, pendergrast, as, the, world, s, second, most, legally, traded, commodity, instead, coffee, was, the, second, most, valuable, commodity, exported, by, developing, countries, from, 1970, to, circa, 2000, this, fact, was, derived, from, the, united, nations, conference, on, trade, and, development, commodity, yearbooks, which, show, third, world, commodity, exports, by, value, in, the, period, 1970, 1998, with, crude, oil, in, first, place, coffee, in, second, followed, by, sugar, cotton, and, others, coffee, continues, to, be, an, important, commodity, export, for, developing, countries, but, more, recent, figures, are, not, readily, available, due, to, the, shifting, and, politicized, nature, of, the, category, developing, country, coffee, is, one, of, seven, commodities, included, in, the, eu, regulation, on, deforestation, free, products, eudr, which, aims, to, guarantee, that, the, products, european, union, eu, citizens, consume, do, not, contribute, to, deforestation, or, forest, degradation, worldwide, international, coffee, day, which, is, claimed, to, have, originated, in, japan, in, 1983, with, an, event, organized, by, the, all, japan, coffee, association, takes, place, on, 29, september, in, several, countries, there, are, numerous, trade, associations, and, lobbying, and, other, organizations, representing, the, coffee, industry, nordic, countries, are, the, highest, coffee, consuming, nations, when, measured, per, capita, per, year, with, consumption, in, finland, as, the, world, s, highest, an, april, 2024, national, coffee, association, survey, indicated, that, coffee, consumption, in, the, u, s, reached, a, 20, year, high, with, 67, of, u, s, adults, reporting, drinking, coffee, in, the, past, day, this, is, a, significant, increase, compared, to, 2004, when, fewer, than, half, of, u, s, adults, reported, coffee, consumption, in, the, past, day, drip, coffee, remains, the, most, popular, brewing, method, but, espresso, based, beverages, particularly, lattes, espresso, shots, and, cappuccinos, gained, popularity, market, volatility, and, thus, increased, returns, during, 1830, encouraged, brazilian, entrepreneurs, to, shift, their, attention, from, gold, to, coffee, a, crop, hitherto, reserved, for, local, consumption, concurrent, with, this, shift, was, the, commissioning, of, vital, infrastructures, including, approximately, 7, 000, km, 4, 300, mi, of, railroads, between, 1860, and, 1885, the, creation, of, these, railways, enabled, the, importation, of, workers, to, meet, the, enormous, need, for, labor, this, development, primarily, affected, the, state, of, rio, de, janeiro, as, well, as, the, southern, states, of, brazil, most, notably, s, o, paulo, due, to, its, favorable, climate, soils, and, terrain, coffee, production, attracted, immigrants, in, search, of, better, economic, opportunities, in, the, early, 1900s, mainly, these, were, portuguese, italian, spanish, german, and, japanese, nationals, for, instance, s, o, paulo, received, approximately, 733, 000, immigrants, in, the, decade, preceding, 1900, whilst, only, receiving, approximately, 201, 000, immigrants, in, the, six, years, to, 1890, the, production, yield, of, coffee, increases, in, 1880, s, o, paulo, produced, 1, 2, million, bags, 25, of, total, production, in, 1888, 2, 6, million, 40, and, in, 1902, 8, million, bags, 60, coffee, is, then, 63, of, the, country, s, exports, the, gains, made, by, this, trade, allow, sustained, economic, growth, in, the, country, the, four, years, between, planting, a, coffee, and, the, first, harvest, extend, seasonal, variations, in, the, price, of, coffee, the, brazilian, government, is, thus, forced, to, some, extent, to, keep, strong, price, subsidies, during, production, periods, the, concept, of, fair, trade, labeling, which, guarantees, coffee, growers, a, negotiated, preharvest, price, began, in, the, late, 1980s, with, the, max, havelaar, foundation, s, labeling, program, in, the, netherlands, in, 2004, 24, 222, metric, tons, of, 7, 050, 000, produced, worldwide, were, fair, trade, in, 2005, 33, 991, metric, tons, out, of, 6, 685, 000, were, fair, trade, an, increase, from, 0, 34, to, 0, 51, a, number, of, fair, trade, impact, studies, have, shown, that, fair, trade, coffee, produces, a, mixed, impact, on, the, communities, that, grow, it, many, studies, are, skeptical, about, fair, trade, reporting, that, it, often, worsens, the, bargaining, power, of, those, who, are, not, part, of, it, the, first, fair, trade, coffee, was, an, effort, to, import, guatemalan, coffee, into, europe, as, indio, solidarity, coffee, since, the, founding, of, organizations, such, as, the, european, fair, trade, association, 1987, the, production, and, consumption, of, fair, trade, coffee, has, grown, as, some, local, and, national, coffee, chains, started, to, offer, fair, trade, alternatives, for, example, in, april, 2000, after, a, year, long, campaign, by, the, human, rights, organization, global, exchange, starbucks, decided, to, carry, fair, trade, coffee, in, its, stores, since, september, 2009, all, starbucks, espresso, beverages, in, uk, and, ireland, are, made, with, fairtrade, and, shared, planet, certified, coffee, a, 2005, study, done, in, belgium, concluded, that, consumers, buying, behavior, is, not, consistent, with, their, positive, attitude, toward, ethical, products, on, average, 46, of, european, consumers, claimed, to, be, willing, to, pay, substantially, more, for, ethical, products, including, fair, trade, products, such, as, coffee, the, study, found, that, the, majority, of, respondents, were, unwilling, to, pay, the, actual, price, premium, of, 27, for, fair, trade, coffee, specialty, coffee, has, driven, a, desire, for, more, traceable, coffee, and, as, such, businesses, are, offering, coffees, that, may, come, from, a, single, origin, or, a, single, lot, from, a, single, farm, this, can, give, rise, to, the, roaster, developing, a, relationship, with, the, producer, to, discuss, and, collaborate, on, coffee, the, roaster, may, also, choose, to, cut, out, the, importers, and, exporters, to, directly, trade, with, the, producer, or, they, may, fairly, trade, where, any, third, parties, involved, in, the, transaction, are, thought, to, have, added, value, and, there, is, a, high, level, of, transparency, around, the, price, although, often, there, is, no, certification, to, back, it, up, this, process, tends, to, only, be, done, for, high, quality, products, since, keeping, the, coffee, separate, from, other, coffees, adds, costs, and, so, only, coffee, that, roasters, believe, can, command, a, higher, price, will, be, kept, separate, some, coffee, is, sold, through, internet, auction, much, of, it, is, sold, through, a, competition, with, coffees, passing, through, local, and, international, jurors, and, then, the, best, coffees, being, selected, to, be, bid, on, some, estates, known, for, high, quality, coffee, also, sell, their, coffee, through, an, online, auction, this, can, lead, to, increased, price, transparency, since, the, final, price, paid, is, usually, published, brewed, coffee, from, typical, grounds, has, no, essential, nutrients, in, significant, content, in, espresso, however, likely, due, to, its, higher, amount, of, suspended, solids, there, are, significant, contents, of, magnesium, the, b, vitamins, niacin, and, riboflavin, and, 212, mg, of, caffeine, per, 100, grams, of, grounds, one, psychoactive, chemical, in, coffee, is, caffeine, an, adenosine, receptor, antagonist, that, is, known, for, its, stimulant, effects, coffee, also, contains, the, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, carboline, and, harmane, which, may, contribute, to, its, psychoactivity, in, a, healthy, liver, caffeine, is, mostly, broken, down, by, hepatic, enzymes, the, excreted, metabolites, are, mostly, paraxanthines, theobromine, and, theophylline, and, a, small, amount, of, unchanged, caffeine, therefore, the, metabolism, of, caffeine, depends, on, the, state, of, this, enzymatic, system, of, the, liver, coffee, is, also, known, for, its, laxative, effects, inducing, defecation, in, some, people, within, minutes, of, consumption, the, specific, mechanism, of, action, and, chemical, constituents, responsible, are, still, unknown, but, caffeine, is, likely, not, responsible, polyphenols, in, coffee, have, been, shown, to, affect, free, radicals, in, vitro, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, this, effect, occurs, in, humans, polyphenol, levels, vary, depending, on, how, beans, are, roasted, as, well, as, for, how, long, as, interpreted, by, the, linus, pauling, institute, and, the, european, food, safety, authority, dietary, polyphenols, such, as, those, ingested, by, consuming, coffee, have, little, or, no, direct, antioxidant, value, following, ingestion, a, 2017, review, of, clinical, trials, found, that, drinking, coffee, is, generally, safe, within, usual, levels, of, intake, and, is, more, likely, to, improve, health, outcomes, than, to, cause, harm, at, doses, of, 3, or, 4, cups, of, coffee, daily, exceptions, include, possible, increased, risk, in, women, having, bone, fractures, and, a, possible, increased, risk, in, pregnant, women, of, fetal, loss, or, decreased, birth, weight, results, were, complicated, by, poor, study, quality, and, differences, in, age, gender, health, status, and, serving, size, depending, on, the, type, of, coffee, and, method, of, preparation, the, caffeine, content, of, a, single, serving, can, vary, greatly, the, caffeine, content, of, a, cup, of, coffee, varies, depending, mainly, on, the, brewing, method, and, also, on, the, coffee, variety, according, to, the, usda, national, nutrient, database, a, 240, millilitre, 8, us, fl, oz, cup, of, coffee, brewed, from, grounds, contains, 95, mg, caffeine, whereas, an, espresso, 25, ml, contains, 53, mg, according, to, an, article, in, the, journal, of, the, american, dietetic, association, coffee, has, the, following, caffeine, content, depending, on, how, it, is, prepared, caffeine, remains, stable, up, to, 200, c, 392, f, and, completely, decomposes, around, 285, c, 545, f, given, that, roasting, temperatures, do, not, exceed, 200, c, 392, f, for, long, and, rarely, if, ever, reach, 285, c, 545, f, the, caffeine, content, of, a, coffee, is, not, likely, changed, much, by, the, roasting, process, coffee, is, often, consumed, alongside, or, instead, of, breakfast, by, many, at, home, or, when, eating, out, at, diners, or, cafeterias, it, is, often, served, at, the, end, of, a, formal, meal, normally, with, a, dessert, and, at, times,
