experiences, of, family, leisure, for, example, leisure, moments, are, part, of, work, in, rural, areas, and, the, rural, idyll, is, enacted, by, urban, families, on, weekends, but, both, urban, and, rural, families, somehow, romanticize, rural, contexts, as, ideal, spaces, for, family, making, connection, to, nature, slower, and, more, intimate, space, notion, of, a, caring, social, fabric, tranquillity, etc, also, much, family, leisure, requires, tasks, that, are, most, often, assigned, to, women, family, leisure, also, includes, playing, together, with, family, members, on, the,
