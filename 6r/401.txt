skateboarding, is, an, action, sport, that, involves, riding, and, performing, tricks, using, a, skateboard, as, well, as, a, recreational, activity, an, art, form, an, entertainment, industry, job, and, a, method, of, transportation, originating, in, the, united, states, skateboarding, has, been, shaped, and, influenced, by, many, skateboarders, throughout, the, years, a, 2009, report, found, that, the, skateboarding, market, is, worth, an, estimated, 4, 8, billion, in, annual, revenue, with, 11, 08, million, active, skateboarders, in, the, world, in, 2016, it, was, announced, that, skateboarding, would, be, represented, at, the, 2020, summer, olympics, in, tokyo, for, both, male, and, female, teams, skateboarding, made, its, olympic, debut, in, 2020, and, was, included, in, the, 2024, games, since, the, 1970s, skateparks, have, been, constructed, specifically, for, use, by, skateboarders, freestyle, bmxers, aggressive, skaters, and, more, recently, scooters, however, skateboarding, has, become, controversial, in, areas, in, which, the, activity, although, legal, has, damaged, curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and, parks, the, first, skateboards, started, with, wooden, boxes, or, boards, with, roller, skate, wheels, attached, to, the, bottom, crate, scooters, preceded, skateboards, having, a, wooden, crate, attached, to, the, nose, front, of, the, board, which, formed, rudimentary, handlebars, the, boxes, turned, into, planks, similar, to, the, skateboard, decks, of, today, skateboarding, as, it, exists, today, was, probably, born, sometime, in, the, late, 1940s, or, early, 1950s, when, surfers, in, california, wanted, something, to, do, when, the, waves, were, flat, this, was, called, sidewalk, surfing, a, new, wave, of, surfing, on, the, sidewalk, as, the, sport, of, surfing, became, highly, popular, no, one, knows, who, made, the, first, board, it, seems, that, several, people, came, up, with, similar, ideas, at, around, the, same, time, the, first, manufactured, skateboards, were, ordered, by, a, los, angeles, california, surf, shop, meant, to, be, used, by, surfers, in, their, downtime, the, shop, owner, bill, richard, made, a, deal, with, the, chicago, roller, skate, company, to, produce, sets, of, skate, wheels, which, they, attached, to, square, wooden, boards, accordingly, skateboarding, was, originally, denoted, sidewalk, surfing, and, early, skaters, emulated, surfing, style, and, maneuvers, and, performed, barefoot, by, the, 1960s, a, small, number, of, surfing, manufacturers, in, southern, california, such, as, jack, s, kips, hobie, bing, s, and, makaha, started, building, skateboards, that, resembled, small, surfboards, and, assembled, teams, to, promote, their, products, one, of, the, earliest, skateboard, exhibitions, was, sponsored, by, makaha, s, founder, larry, stevenson, in, 1963, and, it, was, held, at, the, pier, avenue, junior, high, school, in, hermosa, beach, california, some, of, these, same, teams, of, skateboarders, were, also, featured, on, a, television, show, called, surf, s, up, in, 1964, hosted, by, stan, richards, that, helped, promote, skateboarding, as, something, new, and, fun, to, do, as, the, popularity, of, skateboarding, began, expanding, the, first, skateboarding, magazine, the, quarterly, skateboarder, was, published, in, 1964, john, severson, who, published, the, magazine, wrote, in, his, first, editorial, today, s, skateboarders, are, founders, in, this, sport, they, re, pioneers, they, are, the, first, there, is, no, history, in, skateboarding, its, being, made, now, by, you, the, sport, is, being, molded, and, we, believe, that, doing, the, right, thing, now, will, lead, to, a, bright, future, for, the, sport, already, there, are, storm, clouds, on, the, horizon, with, opponents, of, the, sport, talking, about, ban, and, restriction, the, magazine, only, lasted, four, issues, but, resumed, publication, as, skateboarder, in, 1975, the, first, broadcast, of, an, actual, skateboarding, competition, was, the, 1965, national, skateboarding, championships, which, were, held, in, anaheim, california, and, aired, on, abc, s, wide, world, of, sports, because, skateboarding, was, a, new, sport, during, this, time, there, were, only, two, original, disciplines, during, competitions, flatland, freestyle, and, slalom, downhill, racing, animated, cartoons, of, the, time, occasionally, featured, skateboard, gags, two, road, runner, cartoons, made, in, 1965, shot, and, bothered, and, out, and, out, rout, feature, wile, e, coyote, riding, a, skateboard, one, of, the, earliest, sponsored, skateboarders, patti, mcgee, was, paid, by, hobie, and, vita, pak, to, travel, around, the, country, to, do, skateboarding, exhibitions, and, to, demonstrate, skateboarding, safety, tips, mcgee, made, the, cover, of, life, magazine, in, 1965, and, was, featured, on, several, popular, television, programs, the, mike, douglas, show, what, s, my, line, and, the, tonight, show, starring, johnny, carson, which, helped, make, skateboarding, even, more, popular, at, the, time, some, other, well, known, surfer, style, skateboarders, of, the, time, were, danny, bearer, torger, johnson, bruce, logan, bill, and, mark, richards, woody, woodward, and, jim, fitzpatrick, the, growth, of, the, sport, during, this, period, can, also, be, seen, in, sales, figures, for, makaha, which, quoted, 4, million, worth, of, board, sales, between, 1963, and, 1965, by, 1966, a, variety, of, sources, began, to, claim, that, skateboarding, was, dangerous, resulting, in, shops, being, reluctant, to, sell, them, and, parents, being, reluctant, to, buy, them, in, 1966, sales, had, dropped, significantly, and, skateboarder, magazine, had, stopped, publication, the, popularity, of, skateboarding, dropped, and, remained, low, until, the, early, 1970s, in, the, early, 1970s, frank, nasworthy, started, to, develop, a, skateboard, wheel, made, of, polyurethane, calling, his, company, cadillac, wheels, prior, to, this, new, material, skateboards, wheels, were, metal, or, clay, wheels, the, improvement, in, traction, and, performance, was, so, immense, that, from, the, wheel, s, release, in, 1972, the, popularity, of, skateboarding, started, to, rise, rapidly, again, causing, companies, to, invest, more, in, product, development, nasworthy, commissioned, artist, jim, evans, to, do, a, series, of, paintings, promoting, cadillac, wheels, they, were, featured, as, ads, and, posters, in, the, resurrected, skateboarder, magazine, and, proved, immensely, popular, in, promoting, the, new, style, of, skateboarding, in, the, early, 1970s, the, precursors, to, the, modern, skateparks, for, skateboarding, would, be, the, repurposing, of, urban, hydro, and, storm, water, infrastructure, such, as, the, escondido, reservoir, in, san, diego, california, skateboarding, magazine, would, publish, the, location, and, skateboarders, made, up, nicknames, for, each, location, such, as, the, tea, bowl, the, fruit, bowl, bellagio, the, rabbit, hole, bird, bath, the, egg, bowl, upland, pool, and, the, sewer, slide, some, of, the, development, concepts, in, the, terrain, of, skateparks, were, actually, taken, from, the, escondido, reservoir, many, companies, started, to, manufacture, trucks, axles, specially, designed, for, skateboarding, reached, in, 1976, by, tracker, trucks, as, the, equipment, became, more, maneuverable, the, decks, started, to, get, wider, reaching, widths, of, 10, inches, 250, mm, and, over, thus, giving, the, skateboarder, even, more, control, a, banana, board, is, a, skinny, flexible, skateboard, made, of, polypropylene, with, ribs, on, the, underside, for, structural, support, these, were, very, popular, during, the, mid, 1970s, and, were, available, in, a, myriad, of, colors, bright, yellow, probably, being, the, most, memorable, hence, the, name, in, 1975, skateboarding, had, risen, back, in, popularity, enough, to, have, one, of, the, largest, skateboarding, competitions, since, the, 1960s, the, del, mar, national, championships, which, is, said, to, have, had, up, to, 500, competitors, the, competition, lasted, two, days, and, was, sponsored, by, bahne, skateboards, and, cadillac, wheels, while, the, main, event, was, won, by, freestyle, spinning, skate, legend, russ, howell, a, local, skate, team, from, santa, monica, california, the, zephyr, team, ushered, in, a, new, era, of, surfer, style, skateboarding, during, the, competition, that, would, have, a, lasting, impact, on, skateboarding, s, history, with, a, team, of, 12, including, skating, legends, such, as, jay, adams, tony, alva, peggy, oki, and, stacy, peralta, they, brought, a, new, progressive, style, of, skateboarding, to, the, event, based, on, the, style, of, hawaiian, surfers, larry, bertlemann, buttons, kaluhiokalani, and, mark, liddell, craig, stecyk, a, photo, journalist, for, skateboarder, magazine, wrote, about, and, photographed, the, team, along, with, glen, e, friedman, and, shortly, afterwards, ran, a, series, on, the, team, called, the, dogtown, articles, which, eventually, immortalized, the, zephyr, skateboard, team, the, team, became, known, as, the, z, boys, and, would, go, on, to, become, one, of, the, most, influential, teams, in, skateboarding, s, history, soon, skateboarding, contests, for, cash, and, prizes, using, a, professional, tier, system, began, to, be, held, throughout, california, such, as, the, california, free, former, world, professional, skateboard, championships, which, featured, freestyle, and, slalom, competitions, a, precursor, to, the, extreme, sport, of, street, luge, that, was, sanctioned, by, the, united, states, skateboarding, association, ussa, also, took, place, during, the, 1970s, in, signal, hill, california, the, competition, was, called, the, signal, hill, skateboarding, speed, run, with, several, competitors, earning, entries, into, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, at, the, time, clocking, speeds, of, over, 50, mph, 80, km, h, on, a, skateboard, due, to, technology, and, safety, concerns, at, the, time, when, many, competitors, crashed, during, their, runs, the, sport, did, not, gain, popularity, or, support, during, this, time, in, march, 1976, skateboard, city, skatepark, in, port, orange, florida, and, carlsbad, skatepark, in, san, diego, county, california, would, be, the, first, two, large, size, us, skateparks, to, be, opened, to, the, public, just, a, week, apart, they, were, the, first, of, some, 200, skateparks, that, would, be, built, through, 1982, this, was, due, in, part, to, articles, that, were, running, in, the, investment, journals, at, the, time, stating, that, skateparks, were, a, good, investment, notable, skateboarders, from, the, 1970s, also, include, ty, page, tom, inouye, laura, thornhill, ellen, o, neal, kim, cespedes, bob, biniak, jana, payne, waldo, autry, robin, logan, bobby, piercy, russ, howell, ellen, berryman, shogo, kubo, desiree, von, essen, henry, hester, robin, alaway, paul, hackett, michelle, matta, bruce, logan, steve, cathey, edie, robertson, mike, weed, david, hackett, gregg, ayres, darren, ho, and, tom, sims, manufacturers, started, to, experiment, with, more, exotic, composites, and, metals, like, fiberglass, and, aluminum, but, the, common, skateboards, were, made, of, maple, plywood, the, skateboarders, took, advantage, of, the, improved, handling, of, their, skateboards, and, started, inventing, new, tricks, skateboarders, most, notably, ty, page, bruce, logan, bobby, piercy, kevin, reed, and, the, z, boys, started, to, skate, the, vertical, walls, of, swimming, pools, that, were, left, empty, in, the, 1976, california, drought, this, started, the, vert, trend, in, skateboarding, with, increased, control, vert, skaters, could, skate, faster, and, perform, more, dangerous, tricks, such, as, slash, grinds, and, frontside, backside, airs, this, caused, liability, concerns, and, increased, insurance, costs, to, skatepark, owners, and, the, development, first, by, norcon, then, more, successfully, by, rector, of, improved, knee, pads, that, had, a, hard, sliding, cap, and, strong, strapping, proved, to, be, too, little, too, late, during, this, era, the, freestyle, movement, in, skateboarding, began, to, splinter, off, and, develop, into, a, much, more, specialized, discipline, characterized, by, the, development, of, a, wide, assortment, of, flat, ground, tricks, as, a, result, of, the, vert, skating, movement, skate, parks, had, to, contend, with, high, liability, costs, that, led, to, many, park, closures, in, response, vert, skaters, started, making, their, own, ramps, while, freestyle, skaters, continued, to, evolve, their, flatland, style, thus, by, the, beginning, of, the, 1980s, skateboarding, had, once, again, declined, in, popularity, this, period, was, fueled, by, skateboard, companies, that, were, run, by, skateboarders, the, focus, was, initially, on, vert, ramp, skateboarding, the, invention, of, the, no, hands, aerial, later, known, as, the, ollie, by, alan, gelfand, in, florida, in, 1976, and, the, almost, parallel, development, of, the, grabbed, aerial, by, george, orton, and, tony, alva, in, california, made, it, possible, for, skaters, to, perform, airs, on, vertical, ramps, while, this, wave, of, skateboarding, was, sparked, by, commercialized, vert, ramp, skating, a, majority, of, people, who, skateboarded, during, this, period, did, not, ride, vert, ramps, as, most, people, could, not, afford, to, build, vert, ramps, or, did, not, have, access, to, nearby, ramps, street, skating, increased, in, popularity, freestyle, skating, remained, healthy, throughout, this, period, with, pioneers, such, as, rodney, mullen, inventing, many, of, the, basic, tricks, that, would, become, the, foundation, of, modern, street, skating, such, as, the, impossible, and, the, kickflip, the, influence, that, freestyle, exerted, upon, street, skating, became, apparent, during, the, mid, 1980s, however, street, skating, was, still, performed, on, wide, vert, boards, with, short, noses, slide, rails, and, large, soft, wheels, in, response, to, the, tensions, created, by, this, confluence, of, skateboarding, genres, a, rapid, evolution, occurred, in, the, late, 1980s, to, accommodate, the, street, skater, since, few, skateparks, were, available, to, skaters, at, this, time, street, skating, pushed, skaters, to, seek, out, shopping, centers, and, public, and, private, property, as, their, spot, to, skate, public, opposition, in, which, businesses, governments, and, property, owners, have, banned, skateboarding, on, properties, under, their, jurisdiction, or, ownership, would, progressively, intensify, over, the, following, decades, by, 1992, only, a, small, fraction, of, skateboarders, continuing, to, take, part, in, a, highly, technical, version, of, street, skating, combined, with, the, decline, of, vert, skating, produced, a, sport, that, lacked, the, mainstream, appeal, to, attract, new, skaters, during, this, period, numerous, skateboarders, as, well, as, companies, in, the, industry, paid, tribute, to, the, scenes, of, marty, mcfly, skateboarding, in, the, film, back, to, the, future, for, its, influence, in, this, regard, examples, can, be, seen, in, promotional, material, in, interviews, in, which, professional, skateboarders, cite, the, film, as, an, initiation, into, the, action, sport, and, in, the, public, s, recognition, of, the, film, s, influence, tony, hawk, has, stated, that, there, are, plenty, of, legendary, pros, that, i, know, of, that, started, skating, because, they, saw, that, skateboarding, during, the, 1990s, became, dominated, by, street, skateboarding, most, boards, are, about, 7, 1, 4, to, 8, inches, 180, to, 200, mm, wide, and, 30, to, 32, inches, 760, to, 810, mm, long, the, wheels, are, made, of, an, extremely, hard, polyurethane, with, hardness, durometer, approximately, 99a, the, wheel, sizes, are, relatively, small, so, that, the, boards, are, lighter, and, the, wheels, inertia, is, overcome, quicker, thus, making, tricks, more, manageable, board, styles, have, changed, dramatically, since, the, 1970s, but, have, remained, mostly, alike, since, the, mid, 1990s, the, contemporary, shape, of, the, skateboard, is, derived, from, the, freestyle, boards, of, the, 1980s, with, a, largely, symmetrical, shape, and, relatively, narrow, width, this, form, had, become, standard, by, the, mid, 1990s, by, 2001, skateboarding, had, gained, so, much, popularity, that, more, american, people, under, the, age, of, 18, rode, skateboards, 10, 6, million, than, played, baseball, 8, 2, million, although, traditional, organized, team, sports, still, dominated, youth, programs, overall, skateboarding, and, skateparks, began, to, be, viewed, and, used, in, a, variety, of, new, ways, to, complement, academic, lessons, in, schools, including, new, non, traditional, physical, education, skateboarding, programs, like, skatepass, and, skateistan, to, encourage, youth, to, have, better, attendance, self, discipline, and, confidence, this, was, also, based, on, the, healthy, physical, opportunities, skateboarding, was, understood, to, bring, participants, for, muscle, bone, strengthening, and, balance, as, well, as, the, positive, impacts, it, can, have, on, youth, in, teaching, them, mutual, respect, social, networking, artistic, expression, and, an, appreciation, of, the, environment, in, 2003, go, skateboarding, day, was, founded, in, southern, california, by, the, international, association, of, skateboard, companies, iasc, to, promote, skateboarding, throughout, the, world, it, is, celebrated, annually, on, june, 21, to, define, skateboarding, as, the, rebellious, creative, celebration, of, independence, it, continues, to, be, according, to, market, research, firm, american, sports, data, the, number, of, skateboarders, worldwide, increased, by, more, than, 60, percent, between, 1999, and, 2002, from, 7, 8, million, to, 12, 5, million, many, cities, also, began, implementing, recreation, plans, and, statutes, during, this, time, period, as, part, of, their, vision, for, local, parks, and, communities, to, make, public, lands, more, available, in, particular, for, skateboarding, inviting, skateboarders, to, come, in, off, of, the, city, streets, and, into, organized, skateboarding, activity, areas, by, 2006, there, were, over, 2, 400, skateparks, worldwide, and, the, design, of, skateparks, themselves, had, made, a, transition, as, skaters, turned, designers, many, new, places, to, skateboard, designed, specifically, for, street, skaters, such, as, the, buszy, in, milton, keynes, uk, and, the, safe, spot, skate, spot, program, first, initiated, by, professional, skateboarder, rob, dyrdek, throughout, many, cities, allowed, for, the, creation, of, smaller, alternative, safe, skate, plazas, to, be, built, at, a, lower, cost, one, of, the, largest, locations, ever, built, to, skateboard, in, the, world, smp, skatepark, in, china, at, 12, 000, square, meters, in, size, was, built, complete, with, a, 5, 000, seat, stadium, in, 2009, skatelab, opened, the, skateboarding, hall, of, fame, skateboard, museum, nominees, are, chosen, by, the, iasc, efforts, have, been, taken, to, improve, recognition, of, the, cultural, heritage, as, well, as, the, positive, effects, of, encouraging, skateboarding, within, designated, spaces, in, 2015, the, john, f, kennedy, center, for, the, performing, arts, in, washington, d, c, hosted, an, event, at, which, skateboarders, accompanied, by, music, did, tricks, on, a, ramp, constructed, for, a, festival, of, american, culture, the, event, was, the, climax, of, a, ten, day, project, that, transformed, a, federal, institution, formerly, off, limits, to, the, skateboarding, community, into, a, platform, for, that, community, to, show, its, relevance, through, shared, cultural, action, in, a, cultural, common, space, by, raising, 790, 000, the, long, live, southbank, initiative, managed, in, 2017, to, curb, the, destruction, of, a, forty, year, old, spot, in, london, the, southbank, undercroft, a, popular, skate, park, due, to, urban, planning, a, salvaging, operation, whose, effect, extends, beyond, skateboarding, the, presence, of, a, designated, skating, area, within, this, public, space, keeps, the, space, under, nearly, constant, watch, and, drives, homeless, people, away, increasing, the, feeling, of, safety, in, and, near, the, space, the, activity, attracts, artists, such, as, photographers, and, film, makers, as, well, as, a, significant, number, of, tourists, which, in, turn, drives, economic, activity, in, the, neighborhood, recently, barefoot, skating, has, been, experiencing, a, revival, many, skaters, ride, barefoot, particularly, in, summer, and, in, warmer, countries, such, as, south, africa, australia, spain, and, south, america, the, plastic, penny, board, is, intended, to, be, ridden, barefoot, as, is, the, surfboard, inspired, hamboard, electric, skateboards, became, popular, during, the, 2010s, as, did, self, balancing, unicycles, in, a, board, format, the, sport, of, skateboarding, made, its, olympics, debut, at, the, 2020, summer, olympics, in, tokyo, with, both, men, s, and, women, s, events, competitions, took, place, during, july, and, august, 2021, in, two, disciplines, street, and, park, see, skateboarding, at, the, 2020, summer, olympics, with, the, evolution, of, skateparks, and, ramp, skating, the, skateboard, began, to, change, early, skate, tricks, had, consisted, mainly, of, two, dimensional, freestyle, maneuveres, like, riding, on, only, two, wheels, wheelie, or, manual, spinning, only, on, the, back, wheels, a, pivot, high, jumping, over, a, bar, and, landing, on, the, board, again, also, known, as, a, hippie, jump, long, jumping, from, one, board, to, another, often, over, small, barrels, or, fearless, teenagers, or, slalom, another, popular, trick, was, the, bertlemann, slide, named, after, larry, bertelemann, s, surfing, maneuveres, in, 1976, skateboarding, was, transformed, by, the, invention, of, the, ollie, by, alan, ollie, gelfand, it, remained, largely, a, unique, florida, trick, until, the, summer, of, 1978, when, gelfand, made, his, first, visit, to, california, gelfand, and, his, revolutionary, maneuvers, caught, the, attention, of, the, west, coast, skaters, and, the, media, where, it, began, to, spread, worldwide, the, ollie, was, adapted, to, flat, ground, by, rodney, mullen, in, 1982, mullen, also, invented, the, magic, flip, which, was, later, renamed, the, kickflip, as, well, as, many, other, tricks, including, the, 360, kickflip, which, is, a, 360, pop, shove, it, and, a, kickflip, in, the, same, motion, the, flat, ground, ollie, forms, the, basis, of, many, street, skating, tricks, allowing, skateboarders, to, perform, tricks, in, mid, air, without, any, more, equipment, than, the, skateboard, itself, a, recent, development, in, the, world, of, trick, skating, is, the, 1080, which, was, first, ever, landed, by, tom, schaar, in, 2012, skateboarding, was, popularized, by, the, 1986, skateboarding, cult, classic, thrashin, directed, by, david, winters, and, starring, josh, brolin, it, features, appearances, from, many, famous, skaters, such, as, tony, alva, tony, hawk, christian, hosoi, and, steve, caballero, thrashin, also, had, a, direct, impact, on, lords, of, dogtown, as, catherine, hardwicke, who, directed, lords, of, dogtown, was, hired, by, winters, to, work, on, thrashin, as, a, production, designer, where, she, met, worked, with, and, befriended, many, famous, skaters, including, the, real, alva, hawk, hosoi, and, caballero, skateboarding, was, at, first, tied, to, the, culture, of, surfing, as, skateboarding, spread, across, the, united, states, to, places, unfamiliar, with, surfing, or, surfer, culture, it, developed, an, image, of, its, own, for, example, the, classic, film, short, video, days, 1991, portrayed, skateboarders, as, reckless, rebels, california, duo, jan, and, dean, recorded, the, song, sidewalk, surfin, in, 1964, which, is, the, beach, boys, song, catch, a, wave, with, new, lyrics, associated, with, skateboarding, instead, of, surfing, certain, cities, still, oppose, the, building, of, skate, parks, in, their, neighborhoods, for, fear, of, increased, crime, and, drugs, in, the, area, the, rift, between, the, old, image, of, skateboarding, and, a, newer, one, is, quite, visible, magazines, such, as, thrasher, portray, skateboarding, as, dirty, rebellious, and, still, firmly, tied, to, punk, while, other, publications, transworld, skateboarding, as, an, example, paint, a, more, diverse, and, controlled, picture, of, skateboarding, as, more, professional, skaters, use, hip, hop, reggae, or, hard, rock, music, accompaniment, in, their, videos, many, urban, youths, hip, hop, fans, reggae, fans, and, hard, rock, fans, are, also, drawn, to, skateboarding, further, diluting, the, sport, s, punk, image, group, spirit, supposedly, influences, the, members, of, this, community, in, presentations, of, this, sort, showcasing, of, criminal, tendencies, is, absent, and, no, attempt, is, made, to, tie, extreme, sports, to, any, kind, of, illegal, activity, female, based, skateboarding, groups, also, exist, such, as, brujas, which, is, based, in, new, york, city, many, women, use, their, participation, in, skate, crews, to, perform, an, alternative, form, of, femininity, these, female, skate, crews, offer, a, safe, haven, for, women, and, girls, in, cities, where, they, can, skate, and, bond, without, male, expectations, or, competition, the, increasing, availability, of, technology, is, apparent, within, the, skateboarding, community, many, skateboarders, record, and, edit, videos, of, themselves, and, friends, skateboarding, however, part, of, this, culture, is, to, not, merely, replicate, but, to, innovate, emphasis, is, placed, on, finding, new, places, and, landing, new, tricks, skateboarding, video, games, have, also, become, very, popular, in, skateboarding, culture, some, of, the, most, popular, are, the, tony, hawk, series, and, skate, series, for, various, consoles, including, hand, held, and, personal, computer, whilst, early, skateboarders, generally, rode, barefoot, preferring, direct, foot, to, board, contact, and, some, skaters, continue, to, do, so, one, of, the, early, leading, trends, associated, with, the, sub, culture, of, skateboarding, itself, was, the, sticky, soled, slip, on, skate, shoe, most, popularized, by, sean, penn, s, skateboarding, character, from, the, 1982, film, fast, times, at, ridgemont, high, because, early, skateboarders, were, actually, surfers, trying, to, emulate, the, sport, of, surfing, at, the, time, when, skateboards, first, came, out, on, the, market, many, skateboarded, barefoot, but, skaters, often, lacked, traction, which, led, to, foot, injuries, this, necessitated, the, need, for, a, shoe, that, was, specifically, designed, and, marketed, for, skateboarding, such, as, the, randy, 720, manufactured, by, the, randolph, rubber, company, and, vans, sneakers, which, eventually, became, cultural, iconic, signifiers, for, skateboarders, during, the, 1970s, and, 80s, as, skateboarding, became, more, widespread, while, the, skate, shoes, design, afforded, better, connection, and, traction, with, the, deck, skaterboarders, themselves, could, often, be, identified, when, wearing, the, shoes, with, tony, hawk, once, saying, if, you, were, wearing, vans, shoes, in, 86, you, were, a, skateboarder, because, of, its, connection, with, skateboarding, vans, financed, the, legendary, skateboarding, documentary, dogtown, and, z, boys, and, was, the, first, sneaker, company, to, endorse, a, professional, skateboarder, stacy, peralta, vans, has, a, long, history, of, being, a, major, sponsor, of, many, of, skateboarding, s, competitions, and, events, throughout, skateboarding, s, history, as, well, including, the, vans, warped, tour, and, the, vans, triple, crown, series, as, it, eventually, became, more, apparent, that, skateboarding, had, a, particular, identity, with, a, style, of, shoe, other, brands, of, shoe, companies, began, to, specifically, design, skate, shoes, for, functionality, and, style, to, further, enhance, the, experience, and, culture, of, skateboarding, including, such, brands, as, converse, nike, dc, shoes, globe, adidas, zoo, york, and, world, industries, many, professional, skateboarders, are, designed, a, pro, model, skate, shoe, with, their, name, on, it, once, they, have, received, a, skateboarding, sponsorship, after, becoming, notable, skateboarders, some, shoe, companies, involved, with, skateboarding, like, sole, technology, an, american, footwear, company, that, makes, the, etnies, skate, shoe, brand, further, distinguish, themselves, in, the, market, by, collaborating, with, local, cities, to, open, public, skateparks, such, as, the, etnies, skatepark, in, lake, forest, california, individuality, and, a, self, expressed, casual, style, have, always, been, cultural, values, for, skateboarders, as, uniforms, and, jerseys, are, not, typically, worn, this, type, of, personal, style, for, skateboarders, is, often, reflected, in, the, graphical, designs, illustrated, on, the, bottom, of, the, deck, of, skateboards, since, its, initial, conception, in, the, mid, seventies, when, wes, humpston, and, jim, muri, first, began, doing, design, work, for, dogtown, skateboards, out, of, their, garage, by, hand, creating, the, very, first, iconic, skateboard, deck, art, with, the, design, of, the, dogtown, cross, prior, to, the, mid, seventies, many, early, skateboards, were, originally, based, upon, the, concept, of, sidewalk, surfing, and, were, tied, to, the, surf, culture, skateboards, were, surfboard, like, in, appearance, with, little, to, no, graphics, located, under, the, bottom, of, the, skateboard, deck, some, of, the, early, manufactured, skateboards, such, as, roller, derby, the, duraflex, surfer, and, the, banana, board, are, characteristic, some, skateboards, during, that, time, were, manufactured, with, company, logo, s, or, stickers, across, the, top, of, the, deck, of, the, skateboard, as, griptape, was, not, initially, used, for, construction, but, as, skateboarding, progressed, and, evolved, and, as, artists, began, to, design, and, add, influence, to, the, artwork, of, skateboards, designs, and, themes, began, to, change, there, were, several, artistic, skateboarding, pioneers, that, had, an, influence, on, the, culture, of, skateboarding, during, the, 1980s, that, transformed, skateboard, deck, art, like, jim, phillips, whose, edgy, comic, book, style, screaming, hand, not, only, became, the, main, logo, for, santa, cruz, skateboards, but, eventually, transcended, into, tattoos, of, the, same, image, for, thousands, of, people, and, vinyl, collectible, figurines, over, the, years, artist, vernon, courtlandt, johnson, is, said, to, have, used, his, artwork, of, skeletons, and, skulls, for, powell, peralta, during, the, same, time, that, the, music, genres, of, punk, rock, and, new, wave, music, were, beginning, to, mesh, with, the, culture, of, skateboarding, some, other, notable, skateboard, artists, that, made, contributions, to, the, culture, of, skateboarding, also, include, andy, jenkins, todd, bratrud, neil, blender, marc, mckee, tod, swank, mark, gonzales, lance, mountain, natas, kaupas, and, jim, evans, over, the, years, skateboard, deck, art, has, continued, to, influence, and, expand, the, culture, of, skateboarding, as, many, people, began, collecting, skateboards, based, on, their, artistic, value, and, nostalgia, productions, of, limited, editions, with, particular, designs, and, types, of, collectible, prints, that, can, be, hung, on, the, wall, have, been, created, by, such, famous, artists, as, andy, warhol, and, keith, haring, most, professional,
