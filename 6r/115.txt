and, stirred, to, incorporate, air, spaces, and, prevent, detectable, ice, crystals, from, forming, it, can, also, be, made, by, whisking, a, flavoured, cream, base, and, liquid, nitrogen, together, the, result, is, a, smooth, semi, solid, foam, that, is, solid, at, very, low, temperatures, below, 2, c, or, 35, f, it, becomes, more, malleable, as, its, temperature, increases, ice, cream, may, be,

the, various, terms, according, to, the, relative, quantities, of, the, main, ingredients, notably, the, amount, of, cream, products, that, do, not, meet, the, criteria, to, be, called, ice, cream, are, sometimes, labelled, frozen, dairy, dessert, instead, in, other, countries, such, as, italy, and, argentina, one, word, is, used, for, all, variants, the, origins, of, frozen, desserts, are, obscure, although, several, accounts, exist, about, their, history, some, sources, describe, frozen, desserts, as, originating, in, persia, as, far, back, as, 550, bc, a, roman, cookbook, dating, back, to, the, 1st, century, includes, recipes, for, sweet, desserts, that, are, sprinkled, with, snow, and, there, are, persian, records, from, the, second, century, for, sweetened, drinks, chilled, with, ice, kakig, ri, is, a, japanese, dessert, made, with, ice, and, flavoured, syrup, the, origins, of, kakig, ri, date, back, to, the, heian, period, in, japanese, history, when, blocks, of, ice, saved, during, the, colder, months, would, be, shaved, and, served, with, sweet, syrup, to, the, japanese, aristocracy, during, the, summer, kakig, ri, s, origin, is, referred, to, in, the, pillow, book, a, book, of, observations, written, by, sei, sh, nagon, who, served, the, imperial, court, during, the, heian, period, the, earliest, known, written, process, to, artificially, make, ice, is, known, not, from, culinary, texts, but, the, 13th, century, writings, of, syrian, historian, ibn, abu, usaybia, in, his, book, kitab, uyun, al, anba, fi, tabaqat, al, atibba, book, of, sources, of, information, on, the, classes, of, physicians, concerning, medicine, in, which, ibn, abu, usaybi, a, attributes, the, process, to, an, even, older, author, ibn, bakhtawayhi, of, whom, nothing, is, known, ice, cream, production, became, easier, with, the, discovery, of, the, endothermic, effect, prior, to, this, cream, could, be, chilled, easily, but, not, frozen, it, was, the, addition, of, salt, that, lowered, the, melting, point, of, ice, which, had, the, effect, of, drawing, heat, from, the, cream, and, allowing, it, to, freeze, in, the, 16th, century, the, mughal, empire, used, relays, of, horsemen, to, bring, ice, from, the, hindu, kush, to, its, capital, delhi, used, to, create, kulfi, a, popular, frozen, dairy, dessert, from, the, indian, subcontinent, often, described, as, traditional, indian, ice, cream, the, technique, of, freezing, was, not, known, from, any, european, sources, prior, to, the, 16th, century, during, the, 16th, century, authors, made, reference, to, the, refrigerant, effect, that, happened, when, salt, was, added, to, ice, causing, it, to, freeze, however, it, was, not, until, the, latter, part, of, the, 17th, century, that, sorbets, and, ice, creams, were, made, using, this, process, ice, cream, s, spread, throughout, europe, is, sometimes, attributed, to, moorish, traders, but, more, often, marco, polo, though, it, is, not, mentioned, in, any, of, his, writings, polo, is, often, credited, with, introducing, sorbet, style, desserts, to, italy, after, learning, of, them, during, his, travels, to, china, according, to, a, legend, the, italian, duchess, catherine, de, medici, is, said, to, have, introduced, flavoured, sorbet, ices, to, france, when, she, brought, some, italian, chefs, with, her, to, france, upon, marrying, the, duke, of, orl, ans, henry, ii, of, france, in, 1533, but, in, fact, no, italian, chefs, were, present, in, france, during, the, medici, period, and, it, is, known, that, ice, cream, already, existed, in, france, before, catherine, de, medici, was, born, one, hundred, years, later, charles, i, of, england, was, reportedly, so, impressed, by, the, frozen, snow, that, he, offered, his, own, ice, cream, maker, a, lifetime, pension, in, return, for, keeping, the, formula, secret, so, that, ice, cream, could, be, a, royal, prerogative, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, these, legends, as, far, back, as, 1665, the, catalogue, des, marchandises, rares, edited, in, montpellier, by, jean, fargeon, listed, a, type, of, frozen, sorbet, while, the, composition, of, this, sorbet, is, not, provided, fargeon, specified, that, it, was, consumed, frozen, using, a, container, that, was, plunged, into, a, mixture, of, ice, and, saltpetre, these, sorbets, were, transported, in, pots, made, of, clay, and, sold, for, three, livres, per, pound, according, to, l, isle, des, hermaphrodites, the, practice, of, cooling, beverages, with, ice, and, snow, had, already, emerged, in, paris, particularly, in, the, court, during, the, 16th, century, the, narrator, notes, that, his, hosts, stored, ice, and, snow, which, they, later, added, to, their, wine, this, practice, slowly, progressed, during, the, reign, of, louis, xiii, and, was, likely, a, necessary, step, towards, the, creation, of, ice, cream, in, fact, as, early, as, 1682, le, nouveau, confiturier, fran, ois, provided, a, recipe, for, a, specific, type, of, ice, cream, called, neige, de, fleur, d, orange, in, 1686, italian, francesco, dei, coltelli, opened, an, ice, cream, caf, in, paris, and, the, product, became, so, popular, that, during, the, next, 50, years, another, 250, caf, s, opened, in, paris, the, first, recipe, in, french, for, flavoured, ices, appears, in, 1674, in, nicholas,

popular, throughout, the, world, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, after, cheap, refrigeration, became, common, there, was, an, explosion, of, ice, cream, stores, and, of, flavours, and, types, vendors, often, competed, on, the, basis, of, variety, howard, johnson, s, restaurants, advertised, a, world, of, 28, flavors, and, baskin, robbins, made, its, 31, flavors, one, for, every, day, of, the, month, the, cornerstone, of, its, marketing, strategy, the, company, now, boasts, that, it, has, developed, over, 1, 000, varieties, one, important, development, in, the, 20th, century, was, the, introduction, of, soft, ice, cream, which, has, more, air, mixed, in, thereby, reducing, costs, the, soft, ice, cream, machine, fills, a, cone, or, dish, from, a, spigot, in, the, united, states, chains, such, as, dairy, queen, carvel, and, tastee, freez, helped, popularize, soft, serve, ice, cream, baskin, robbins, would, later, incorporate, it, into, their, menu, technological, innovations, such, as, these, have, introduced, various, food, additives, into, ice, cream, most, notably, the, stabilizing, agent, gluten, to, which, some, people, have, an, intolerance, recent, awareness, of, this, issue, has, prompted, a, number, of, manufacturers, to, start, producing, gluten, free, ice, cream, the, 1980s, saw, thicker, ice, creams, being, sold, as, premium, and, super, premium, varieties, under, brands, such, as, ben, jerry, s, chocolate, shoppe, ice, cream, company, and, h, agen, dazs, ice, cream, is, a, colloidal, emulsion, made, with, water, ice, milk, fat, milk, protein, sugar, and, air, water, and, fat, have, the, highest, proportions, by, weight, creating, an, emulsion, that, has, dispersed, phase, as, fat, globules, the, emulsion, is, turned, into, foam, by, incorporating, air, cells, which, are, frozen, to, form, dispersed, ice, cells, the, triacylglycerols, in, fat, are, nonpolar, and, will, adhere, to, themselves, by, van, der, waals, interactions, water, is, polar, thus, emulsifiers, are, needed, for, dispersion, of, fat, also, ice, cream, has, a, colloidal, phase, of, foam, which, helps, in, its, light, texture, milk, proteins, such, as, casein, and, whey, protein, present, in, ice, cream, are, amphiphilic, can, adsorb, water, and, form, micelles, which, will, contribute, to, its, consistency, the, proteins, contribute, to, the, emulsification, aeration, and, texture, sucrose, which, is, a, disaccharide, is, usually, used, as, a, sweetening, agent, lactose, which, is, sugar, present, in, milk, will, cause, freezing, point, depression, thus, on, freezing, some, water, will, remain, unfrozen, and, will, not, give, a, hard, texture, too, much, lactose, will, result, in, a, non, ideal, texture, because, of, either, excessive, freezing, point, depression, or, lactose, crystallization, before, the, development, of, modern, refrigeration, ice, cream, was, a, luxury, reserved, for, special, occasions, making, it, was, quite, laborious, ice, was, cut, from, lakes, and, ponds, during, the, winter, and, stored, in, holes, in, the, ground, or, in, wood, frame, or, brick, ice, houses, insulated, by, straw, many, farmers, and, plantation, owners, including, u, s, presidents, george, washington, and, thomas, jefferson, cut, and, stored, ice, in, the, winter, for, use, in, the, summer, frederic, tudor, of, boston, turned, ice, harvesting, and, shipping, into, a, big, business, cutting, ice, in, new, england, and, shipping, it, around, the, world, ice, cream, was, made, by, hand, in, a, large, bowl, placed, inside, a, tub, filled, with, ice, and, salt, this, is, called, the, pot, freezer, method, french, confectioners, refined, the, pot, freezer, method, making, ice, cream, in, a, sorbeti, re, a, covered, pail, with, a, handle, attached, to, the, lid, in, the, pot, freezer, method, the, temperature, of, the, ingredients, is, reduced, by, the, mixture, of, crushed, ice, and, salt, the, salt, water, is, cooled, by, the, ice, and, the, action, of, the, salt, on, the, ice, causes, it, to, partially, melt, absorbing, latent, heat, and, bringing, the, mixture, below, the, freezing, point, of, pure, water, the, immersed, container, can, also, make, better, thermal, contact, with, the, salty, water, and, ice, mixture, than, it, could, with, ice, alone, the, hand, cranked, churn, which, also, uses, ice, and, salt, for, cooling, replaced, the, pot, freezer, method, the, exact, origin, of, the, hand, cranked, freezer, is, unknown, but, the, first, u, s, patent, for, one, was, 3254, issued, to, nancy, johnson, on, 9, september, 1843, the, hand, cranked, churn, produced, smoother, ice, cream, than, the, pot, freezer, and, did, it, quicker, many, inventors, patented, improvements, on, johnson, s, design, in, europe, and, early, america, ice, cream, was, made, and, sold, by, small, businesses, mostly, confectioners, and, caterers, jacob, fussell, of, baltimore, maryland, was, the, first, to, manufacture, ice, cream, on, a, large, scale, fussell, bought, fresh, dairy, products, from, farmers, in, york, county, pennsylvania, and, sold, them, in, baltimore, an, unstable, demand, for, his, dairy, products, often, left, him, with, a, surplus, of, cream, which, he, made, into, ice, cream, he, built, his, first, ice, cream, factory, in, seven, valleys, pennsylvania, in, 1851, two, years, later, he, moved, his, factory, to, baltimore, later, he, opened, factories, in, several, other, cities, and, taught, the, business, to, others, who, operated, their, own, plants, mass, production, reduced, the, cost, of, ice, cream, and, added, to, its, popularity, the, development, of, industrial, refrigeration, by, german, engineer, carl, von, linde, during, the, 1870s, eliminated, the, need, to, cut, and, store, natural, ice, and, when, the, continuous, process, freezer, was, perfected, in, 1926, commercial, mass, production, of, ice, cream, and, the, birth, of, the, modern, ice, cream, industry, was, underway, in, modern, times, a, common, method, for, producing, ice, cream, at, home, is, to, use, an, ice, cream, maker, an, electrical, device, that, churns, the, ice, cream, mixture, while, cooled, inside, a, household, freezer, some, more, expensive, models, have, an, built, in, freezing, element, a, newer, method, is, to, add, liquid, nitrogen, to, the, mixture, while, stirring, it, using, a, spoon, or, spatula, for, a, few, seconds, a, similar, technique, advocated, by, heston, blumenthal, as, ideal, for, home, cooks, is, to, add, dry, ice, to, the, mixture, while, stirring, for, a, few, minutes, some, ice, cream, recipes, call, for, making, a, custard, folding, in, whipped, cream, and, immediately, freezing, the, mixture, another, method, is, to, use, a, pre, frozen, solution, of, salt, and, water, which, gradually, melts, as, the, ice, cream, freezes, an, unusual, method, of, making, ice, cream, was, done, during, world, war, ii, by, american, fighter, pilots, based, in, the, south, pacific, they, attached, pairs, of, 5, us, gallon, 19, l, cans, to, their, aircraft, the, cans, were, fitted, with, a, small, propeller, this, was, spun, by, the, slipstream, and, drove, a, stirrer, which, agitated, the, mixture, while, the, intense, cold, of, high, altitude, froze, it, b, 17, crews, in, europe, did, something, similar, on, their, bombing, runs, as, did, others, ice, cream, can, be, mass, produced, and, thus, is, widely, available, in, developed, parts, of, the, world, ice, cream, can, be, purchased, in, large, cartons, vats, and, squrounds, from, supermarkets, and, grocery, stores, in, smaller, quantities, from, ice, cream, shops, convenience, stores, and, milk, bars, and, in, individual, servings, from, small, carts, or, vans, at, public, events, in, 2015, the, us, produced, nearly, 900, million, us, gallons, 3, 4, 10, 9, l, 750, 000, 000, imp, gal, of, ice, cream, today, jobs, specialize, in, the, selling, of, ice, cream, the, title, of, a, person, who, works, in, this, speciality, is, often, called, an, ice, cream, man, however, women, also, specialize, in, the, selling, of, ice, cream, people, in,
