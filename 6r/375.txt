huddersfield, yorkshire, england, as, the, result, of, a, split, from, the, rugby, football, union, rfu, over, the, issue, of, payments, to, players, the, rules, of, the, game, governed, by, the, new, northern, rugby, football, union, progressively, changed, from, those, of, the, rfu, with, the, specific, aim, of, producing, a, faster, and, more, entertaining, game, to, appeal, to, spectators, on, whose, income, the, new, organisation, and, its, members, depended, in, rugby, league, points, are, scored, by, carrying, an, oval, ball, and, touching, it, to, the, ground, beyond, the, opposing, team, s, goal, line, this, is, called, a, try, and, is, the, primary, method, of, scoring, worth, four, points, the, opposing, team, attempts, to, stop, the, attacking, side, scoring, points, by, tackling, the, player, carrying, the, ball, and, denying, forward, progress, on, occasion, where, a, clear, try, scoring, opportunity, has, been, thwarted, by, foul, play, a, penalty, try, may, be, awarded, without, the, ball, being, grounded, over, the, try, line, in, addition, to, tries, points, can, be, scored, by, kicking, goals, field, goals, or, drop, goals, can, be, attempted, from, the, hand, at, any, time, for, a, single, point, and, following, a, successful, try, the, scoring, team, gains, a, free, kick, to, try, at, goal, with, a, conversion, worth, a, further, two, points, penalty, kicks, at, goal, known, simply, as, penalties, may, also, be, awarded, for, general, foul, play, and, are, also, worth, two, points, unlike, drop, goals, penalty, kicks, and, conversions, are, taken, from, the, ground, with, the, ball, usually, set, in, a, kicking, tee, and, the, opposing, team, not, allowed, to, directly, challenge, the, kicker, the, super, league, in, europe, and, the, national, rugby, league, nrl, in, australasia, are, the, world, s, premier, club, competitions, globally, rugby, league, is, played, internationally, predominantly, by, european, australasian, and, pacific, island, countries, and, is, governed, by, the, international, rugby, league, rugby, league, is, the, national, sport, of, papua, new, guinea, and, the, cook, islands, and, is, a, popular, sport, in, countries, such, as, england, australia, new, zealand, france, tonga, fiji, samoa, the, first, rugby, league, world, cup, was, held, in, france, in, 1954, the, first, world, cup, of, either, rugby, code, and, has, been, held, sporadically, ever, since, settling, into, a, four, yearly, cycle, in, the, 2010s, as, of, 2023, the, holders, are, australia, a, short, sided, version, of, the, sport, rugby, league, nines, using, modified, rugby, league, rules, also, exists, and, is, comparable, to, rugby, sevens, wheelchair, rugby, league, is, a, mixed, gender, sport, using, heavily, modified, rugby, league, rules, for, disabled, and, able, bodied, players, unlike, wheelchair, rugby, which, adopted, its, name, after, the, invention, of, the, sport, previously, called, murderball, and, is, not, directly, linked, to, rugby, union, wheelchair, rugby, league, has, grown, out, of, the, parent, sport, and, retains, key, aspects, of, that, sport, such, as, an, egg, shaped, ball, the, forward, pass, rule, and, conversions, while, not, a, paralympic, sport, the, sport, has, its, own, wheelchair, rugby, league, world, cup, a, further, variation, for, ambulatory,

rugby, league, football, takes, its, name, from, the, bodies, that, split, to, create, a, new, form, of, rugby, distinct, from, that, run, by, the, rugby, football, unions, in, britain, australia, and, new, zealand, between, 1895, and, 1908, the, first, of, these, the, northern, rugby, football, union, was, established, in, 1895, as, a, breakaway, faction, of, england, s, rugby, football, union, rfu, both, organisations, played, the, game, under, the, same, rules, at, first, although, the, northern, union, began, to, modify, rules, almost, immediately, thus, creating, a, new, simpler, game, that, was, intended, to, be, a, faster, paced, form, of, rugby, football, similar, breakaway, factions, split, from, rfu, affiliated, unions, in, australia, and, new, zealand, in, 1907, and, 1908, renaming, themselves, rugby, football, league, s, and, introducing, northern, union, rules, in, 1922, the, northern, union, also, changed, its, name, to, the, rugby, football, league, and, thus, over, time, the, sport, itself, became, known, as, rugby, league, football, in, 1895, a, schism, in, rugby, football, resulted, in, the, formation, of, the, northern, rugby, football, union, nrfu, the, success, of, working, class, northern, teams, led, to, some, compensating, players, who, otherwise, would, be, on, their, job, and, earning, income, on, saturdays, this, led, to, the, rfu, reacting, to, enforce, the, amateur, principle, of, the, sport, preventing, broken, time, payments, to, players, who, had, taken, time, off, work, to, play, rugby, northern, teams, typically, had, more, working, class, players, coal, miners, mill, workers, etc, who, could, not, afford, to, play, without, this, compensation, in, contrast, to, affluent, southern, teams, who, had, other, sources, of, income, to, sustain, the, amateur, principle, in, 1895, a, decree, by, the, rfu, banning, the, playing, of, rugby, at, grounds, where, entrance, fees, were, charged, led, to, twenty, two, clubs, including, stockport, who, negotiated, by, telephone, meeting, at, the, george, hotel, huddersfield, on, 29, august, 1895, and, forming, the, northern, rugby, football, union, within, fifteen, years, of, that, first, meeting, in, huddersfield, more, than, 200, rfu, clubs, had, left, to, join, the, rugby, league, in, 1897, the, line, out, was, abolished, and, in, 1898, professionalism, introduced, in, 1906, the, northern, union, changed, its, rules, reducing, teams, from, 15, to, 13, a, side, and, replacing, the, ruck, formed, after, tackles, with, the, play, the, ball, by, this, point, rule, changes, meant, the, game, organised, by, the, rfl, was, distinct, as, a, sport, from, its, union, cousin, a, similar, schism, to, that, which, occurred, in, england, took, place, in, sydney, australia, there, on, 8, august, 1907, the, new, south, wales, rugby, football, league, was, founded, at, bateman, s, hotel, in, george, street, unlike, in, england, where, both, codes, maintained, their, own, geographic, areas, of, dominance, in, australia, rugby, league, went, on, to, displace, rugby, union, entirely, as, the, primary, football, code, in, new, south, wales, and, queensland, while, australian, rules, football, dominated, the, rest, of, australia, on, 5, may, 1954, 102, 569, spectators, watched, the, 1953, 54, challenge, cup, final, replay, at, odsal, stadium, bradford, england, setting, a, new, record, for, attendance, at, a, rugby, football, match, of, either, code, also, in, 1954, the, rugby, league, world, cup, the, first, for, either, code, of, rugby, was, formed, at, the, instigation, of, the, french, in, 1966, the, international, board, introduced, a, rule, that, a, team, in, possession, was, allowed, three, play, the, balls, and, on, the, fourth, tackle, a, scrum, was, to, be, formed, this, was, increased, to, six, tackles, in, 1972, and, in, 1983, the, scrum, was, replaced, by, a, handover, 1967, saw, the, first, professional, sunday, matches, of, rugby, league, played, the, first, sponsors, joshua, tetley, and, john, player, entered, the, game, for, the, 1971, 72, northern, rugby, football, league, season, television, had, an, enormous, impact, on, the, sport, of, rugby, league, in, the, 1990s, when, news, corporation, paid, for, worldwide, broadcasting, rights, the, media, giant, s, super, league, movement, created, changes, for, the, traditional, administrators, of, the, game, in, europe, it, resulted, in, a, move, from, rugby, league, being, a, winter, sport, to, a, summer, one, as, the, new, super, league, competition, tried, to, expand, its, market, in, australasia, the, super, league, war, resulted, in, long, and, costly, legal, battles, and, changing, loyalties, causing, significant, damage, to, the, code, in, an, extremely, competitive, sporting, market, in, 1997, two, competitions, were, run, alongside, each, other, in, australia, after, which, a, peace, deal, in, the, form, of, the, national, rugby, league, was, formed, the, nrl, has, since, become, recognised, as, the, sport, s, flagship, competition, and, since, that, time, has, set, record, tv, ratings, and, crowd, figures, the, objective, in, rugby, league, is, to, score, more, points, through, tries, goals, and, field, goals, also, known, as, drop, goals, than, the, opposition, within, the, 80, minutes, of, play, if, after, two, halves, of, play, each, consisting, of, forty, minutes, the, two, teams, are, drawing, a, draw, may, be, declared, or, the, game, may, enter, extra, time, under, the, golden, point, rule, depending, on, the, relevant, competition, s, format, the, try, is, the, most, common, form, of, scoring, and, a, team, will, usually, attempt, to, score, one, by, running, and, kicking, the, ball, further, upfield, or, passing, from, player, to, player, in, order, to, manoeuvre, around, the, opposition, s, defence, a, try, involves, touching, the, ball, to, the, ground, on, or, beyond, the, defending, team, s, goal, line, and, is, worth, four, points, a, goal, is, worth, two, points, and, may, be, gained, from, a, conversion, or, a, penalty, a, field, goal, or, drop, goal, is, only, worth, one, point, and, is, gained, by, dropping, and, then, kicking, the, ball, on, the, half, volley, between, the, uprights, in, open, play, a, field, goal, has, a, value, of, 2, points, when, kicked, from, beyond, the, 40, metre, line, field, position, is, crucial, in, rugby, league, achieved, by, running, with, or, kicking, the, ball, passing, in, rugby, league, may, only, be, in, a, backward, or, sideways, direction, teammates, therefore, have, to, remain, on, side, by, not, moving, ahead, of, the, player, with, the, ball, the, ball, may, be, kicked, ahead, but, if, teammates, are, in, front, of, the, kicker, when, the, ball, is, kicked, they, are, deemed, off, side, tackling, is, a, key, component, of, rugby, league, play, only, the, player, holding, the, ball, may, be, tackled, a, tackle, is, complete, for, example, when, the, player, is, held, by, one, or, more, opposing, players, in, such, a, manner, that, he, can, make, no, further, progress, and, cannot, part, with, the, ball, or, when, the, player, is, held, by, one, or, more, opposing, players, and, the, ball, or, the, hand, or, arm, holding, the, ball, comes, into, contact, with, the, ground, an, attacking, team, gets, a, maximum, of, six, tackles, to, progress, up, the, field, before, possession, is, changed, over, once, the, tackle, is, completed, the, ball, carrier, must, be, allowed, to, get, to, his, feet, to, play, the, ball, ball, control, is, also, important, in, rugby, league, as, a, fumble, of, the, ball, on, the, ground, forces, a, handover, unless, the, ball, is, fumbled, backwards, the, ball, can, also, be, turned, over, by, going, over, the, sideline, rugby, league, and, rugby, union, are, distinct, sports, with, many, similarities, and, a, shared, origin, both, have, the, same, fundamental, rules, are, played, for, 80, minutes, and, feature, an, oval, shaped, ball, and, h, shaped, goalposts, both, have, rules, that, the, ball, cannot, be, passed, forward, and, dropping, it, forwards, leads, to, a, scrum, both, use, tries, as, the, central, scoring, method, and, conversion, kicks, penalty, goals, and, drop, goals, as, additional, scoring, methods, however, there, are, differences, in, how, many, points, each, method, is, worth, one, of, the, main, differences, is, the, rules, of, possession, when, the, ball, goes, into, touch, possession, in, rugby, union, is, contested, through, a, line, out, while, in, rugby, league, a, scrum, restarts, play, the, lesser, focus, on, contesting, possession, means, that, play, focuses, more, on, powerful, running, hard, tackling, forward, progression, and, the, contest, for, field, position, commonly, compared, to, an, arm, wrestle, as, a, result, play, stops, much, less, frequently, in, rugby, league, with, the, ball, typically, in, play, for, 50, out, of, the, 80, minutes, compared, to, around, 35, minutes, for, professional, rugby, union, other, differences, include, that, there, are, fewer, players, in, rugby, league, 13, compared, to, 15, and, different, rules, for, tackling, rugby, union, has, more, detailed, rules, than, rugby, league, and, has, changed, less, since, the, 1895, schism, since, rugby, union, turned, professional, in, the, mid, 1990s, it, has, increasingly, borrowed, techniques, tactics, and, even, laws, from, rugby, league, while, high, profile, players, and, coaches, from, the, league, game, have, increasingly, gone, on, to, success, in, the, union, code, in, those, countries, where, both, codes, are, popular, e, g, andy, farrell, jason, robinson, and, henry, paul, the, inherent, similarities, between, rugby, league, and, rugby, union, have, at, times, led, to, experimental, hybrid, games, being, played, that, use, a, mix, of, the, two, sports, rules, much, more, so, than, rugby, union, rugby, league, shares, significant, similarities, with, north, american, gridiron, codes, although, described, as, evolving, from, both, rugby, and, association, football, the, basic, structures, of, american, and, canadian, football, are, remarkably, similar, to, rugby, league, through, a, process, of, parallel, evolution, a, try, and, goal, based, scoring, system, a, set, number, of, plays, before, handover, of, the, football, each, play, restarting, from, a, set, piece, position, and, ended, by, a, tackle, although, the, canadian, football, league, in, particular, maintained, the, word, rugby, in, its, name, for, many, years, alluding, to, that, shared, past, the, introduction, of, the, forward, pass, and, unlimited, substitution, in, north, american, games, created, a, fundamentally, different, species, of, game, from, either, original, rugby, code, although, the, historic, link, between, the, codes, continues, to, be, acknowledged, neither, canadian, or, american, football, is, commonly, considered, a, rugby, code, today, except, in, the, broadest, sense, and, are, more, commonly, referred, to, collectively, as, gridiron, codes, or, simply, as, football, within, their, respective, countries, players, on, the, pitch, are, divided, into, forwards, and, backs, although, the, game, s, rules, apply, to, all, players, the, same, way, each, position, has, a, designated, number, to, identify, himself, from, other, players, these, numbers, help, to, identify, which, position, a, person, is, playing, the, system, of, numbering, players, is, different, depending, on, which, country, the, match, is, played, in, in, australia, and, new, zealand, each, player, is, usually, given, a, number, corresponding, to, their, playing, position, on, the, field, however, since, 1996, european, teams, have, been, able, to, grant, players, specific, squad, numbers, which, they, keep, without, regard, to, the, position, they, play, similarly, to, association, football, substitutes, generally, referred, to, as, the, bench, are, allowed, in, the, sport, and, are, typically, used, when, a, player, gets, tired, or, injured, although, they, can, also, be, used, tactically, each, team, is, currently, allowed, four, substitutes, and, in, australia, and, new, zealand, these, players, occupy, shirt, numbers, 14, to, 22, there, are, no, limitations, on, which, players, must, occupy, these, interchangeable, slots, generally, twelve, interchanges, are, allowed, in, any, game, from, each, team, although, in, the, national, rugby, league, this, was, reduced, to, ten, prior, to, the, 2008, season, and, further, reduced, to, eight, prior, to, the, 2016, season, if, a, team, has, to, interchange, a, player, due, to, the, blood, bin, rule, or, due, to, injury, and, this, was, the, result, of, misconduct, from, the, opposing, team, the, compromised, team, does, not, have, to, use, one, of, its, allocated, interchanges, to, take, the, player, in, question, off, the, field, the, backs, are, generally, smaller, faster, and, more, agile, than, the, forwards, they, are, often, the, most, creative, and, evasive, players, on, the, field, relying, on, running, kicking, and, handling, skills, as, well, as, tactics, and, set, plays, to, break, the, defensive, line, instead, of, brute, force, generally, forwards, play, a, more, collision, oriented, game, making, ground, by, pure, strength, and, tackling, near, the, play, the, ball, usually, the, stand, off, five, eighth, and,
