poultry, p, o, l, t, r, i, are, domesticated, birds, kept, by, humans, for, the, purpose, of, harvesting, animal, products, such, as, meat, eggs, or, feathers, the, practice, of, raising, poultry, is, known, as, poultry, farming, these, birds, are, most, typically, members, of, the, superorder, galloanserae, fowl, especially, the, order, galliformes, which, includes, chickens, quails, and, turkeys, the, term, also, includes, waterfowls, of, the, family, anatidae, ducks, and, geese, but, does, not, include, wild, birds, hunted, for, food, known, as, game, or, quarry, recent, genomic, studies, involving, the, four, extant, junglefowl, species, reveals, that, the, domestication, of, chicken, the, most, populous, poultry, species, occurred, around, 8, 000, years, ago, in, southeast, asia, this, was, previously, believed, to, have, occurred, around, 5, 400, years, ago, also, in, southeast, asia, the, process, may, have, originally, occurred, as, a, result, of, people, hatching, and, rearing, young, birds, from, eggs, collected, from, the, wild, but, later, involved, keeping, the, birds, permanently, in, captivity, domesticated, chickens, may, have, been, used, for, cockfighting, at, first, and, quail, kept, for, their, songs, but, people, soon, realised, the, advantages, of, having, a, captive, bred, source, of, food, selective, breeding, for, fast, growth, egg, laying, ability, conformation, plumage, and, docility, took, place, over, the, centuries, and, modern, breeds, often, look, very, different, from, their, wild, ancestors, although, some, birds, are, still, kept, in, small, flocks, in, extensive, systems, most, birds, available, in, the, market, today, are, reared, in, intensive, commercial, enterprises, together, with, pork, poultry, is, one, of, the, two, most, widely, eaten, types, of, meat, globally, with, over, 70, of, the, meat, supply, in, 2012, between, them, poultry, provides, nutritionally, beneficial, food, containing, high, quality, protein, accompanied, by, a, low, proportion, of, fat, all, poultry, meat, should, be, properly, handled, and, sufficiently, cooked, in, order, to, reduce, the, risk, of, food, poisoning, semi, vegetarians, who, consume, poultry, as, the, only, source, of, meat, are, said, to, adhere, to, pollotarianism, the, word, poultry, comes, from, middle, english, pultry, or, pultrie, itself, derived, from, old, french, norman, word, pouletrie, the, term, for, an, immature, poultry, pullet, like, its, doublet, poult, comes, from, middle, english, pulet, and, old, french, polet, both, from, the, latin, word, pullus, meaning, a, young, fowl, or, young, animal, the, word, fowl, is, of, germanic, origin, cf, old, english, fugol, german, vogel, danish, fugl, poultry, is, a, term, used, for, any, kind, of, domesticated, bird, captive, raised, for, its, utility, and, traditionally, the, word, has, been, used, to, refer, to, wildfowl, galliformes, and, waterfowl, anseriformes, but, not, to, cagebirds, such, as, songbirds, and, parrots, poultry, can, be, defined, as, domestic, fowls, including, chickens, turkeys, geese, and, ducks, raised, for, the, production, of, meat, or, eggs, and, the, word, is, also, used, for, the, flesh, of, these, birds, used, as, food, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, lists, the, same, bird, groups, but, also, includes, guinea, fowl, and, squabs, young, pigeons, in, r, d, crawford, s, poultry, breeding, and, genetics, squabs, are, omitted, but, japanese, quail, and, common, pheasant, are, added, to, the, list, the, latter, frequently, being, bred, in, captivity, and, released, into, the, wild, in, his, 1848, classic, book, on, poultry, ornamental, and, domestic, poultry, their, history, and, management, edmund, dixon, included, chapters, on, the, peafowl, guinea, fowl, mute, swan, turkey, various, types, of, geese, the, muscovy, duck, other, ducks, and, all, types, of, chickens, including, bantams, in, colloquial, speech, the, term, fowl, is, often, used, near, synonymously, with, domesticated, chicken, gallus, gallus, or, with, poultry, or, even, just, bird, and, many, languages, do, not, distinguish, between, poultry, and, fowl, both, words, are, also, used, for, the, flesh, of, these, birds, poultry, can, be, distinguished, from, game, defined, as, wild, birds, or, mammals, hunted, for, food, or, sport, a, word, also, used, to, describe, the, meat, of, these, when, eaten, chickens, are, medium, sized, chunky, birds, with, an, upright, stance, and, characterised, by, fleshy, red, combs, and, wattles, on, their, heads, males, known, as, cocks, are, usually, larger, more, boldly, coloured, and, have, more, exaggerated, plumage, than, females, hens, chickens, are, gregarious, omnivorous, ground, dwelling, birds, that, in, their, natural, surroundings, search, among, the, leaf, litter, for, seeds, invertebrates, and, other, small, animals, they, seldom, fly, except, as, a, result, of, perceived, danger, preferring, to, run, into, the, undergrowth, if, approached, today, s, domestic, chicken, gallus, gallus, domesticus, is, mainly, descended, from, the, wild, red, junglefowl, of, asia, with, some, additional, input, from, grey, junglefowl, sri, lankan, junglefowl, and, green, junglefowl, genomic, studies, estimate, that, the, chicken, was, domesticated, 8, 000, years, ago, in, southeast, asia, and, spread, to, china, and, india, 2000, 3000, years, later, archaeological, evidence, supports, domestic, chickens, in, southeast, asia, well, before, 6000, bc, china, by, 6000, bc, and, india, by, 2000, bc, a, landmark, 2020, nature, study, that, fully, sequenced, 863, chickens, across, the, world, suggests, that, all, domestic, chickens, originate, from, a, single, domestication, event, of, red, junglefowl, whose, present, day, distribution, is, predominantly, in, southwestern, china, northern, thailand, and, myanmar, these, domesticated, chickens, spread, across, southeast, and, south, asia, where, they, interbred, with, local, wild, species, of, junglefowl, forming, genetically, and, geographically, distinct, groups, analysis, of, the, most, popular, commercial, breed, shows, that, the, white, leghorn, breed, possesses, a, mosaic, of, divergent, ancestries, inherited, from, subspecies, of, red, junglefowl, chickens, were, one, of, the, domesticated, animals, carried, with, the, sea, borne, austronesian, migrations, into, taiwan, island, southeast, asia, island, melanesia, madagascar, and, the, pacific, islands, starting, from, around, 3500, to, 2500, bc, by, 2000, bc, chickens, seem, to, have, reached, the, indus, valley, and, 250, years, later, they, arrived, in, egypt, they, were, still, used, for, fighting, and, were, regarded, as, symbols, of, fertility, the, romans, used, them, in, divination, and, the, egyptians, made, a, breakthrough, when, they, learned, the, difficult, technique, of, artificial, incubation, since, then, the, keeping, of, chickens, has, spread, around, the, world, for, the, production, of, food, with, the, domestic, fowl, being, a, valuable, source, of, both, eggs, and, meat, since, their, domestication, a, large, number, of, breeds, of, chickens, have, been, established, but, with, the, exception, of, the, white, leghorn, most, commercial, birds, are, of, hybrid, origin, in, about, 1800, chickens, began, to, be, kept, on, a, larger, scale, and, modern, high, output, poultry, farms, were, present, in, the, united, kingdom, from, around, 1920, and, became, established, in, the, united, states, soon, after, the, second, world, war, by, the, mid, 20th, century, the, poultry, meat, producing, industry, was, of, greater, importance, than, the, egg, laying, industry, poultry, breeding, has, produced, breeds, and, strains, to, fulfil, different, needs, light, framed, egg, laying, birds, that, can, produce, 300, eggs, a, year, fast, growing, fleshy, birds, destined, for, consumption, at, a, young, age, and, utility, birds, which, produce, both, an, acceptable, number, of, eggs, and, a, well, fleshed, carcase, male, birds, are, unwanted, in, the, egg, laying, industry, and, can, often, be, identified, as, soon, as, they, are, hatch, for, subsequent, culling, in, meat, breeds, these, birds, are, sometimes, castrated, often, chemically, to, prevent, aggression, the, resulting, bird, called, a, capon, has, more, tender, and, flavorful, meat, as, well, a, bantam, is, a, small, variety, of, domestic, chicken, either, a, miniature, version, of, a, member, of, a, standard, breed, or, a, true, bantam, with, no, larger, counterpart, the, name, derives, from, the, town, of, bantam, in, java, where, european, sailors, bought, the, local, small, chickens, for, their, shipboard, supplies, bantams, may, be, a, quarter, to, a, third, of, the, size, of, standard, birds, and, lay, similarly, small, eggs, they, are, kept, by, small, holders, and, hobbyists, for, egg, production, use, as, broody, hens, ornamental, purposes, and, showing, cockfighting, is, said, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, spectator, sport, two, mature, males, cocks, or, roosters, are, set, to, fight, each, other, and, will, do, so, with, great, vigour, until, one, is, critically, injured, or, killed, cockfighting, is, extremely, widespread, in, island, southeast, asia, and, often, had, ritual, significance, in, addition, to, being, a, gambling, sport, they, also, formed, part, of, the, cultures, of, ancient, india, china, persia, greece, rome, and, large, sums, were, won, or, lost, depending, on, the, outcome, of, an, encounter, breeds, such, as, the, aseel, were, developed, in, the, indian, subcontinent, for, their, aggressive, behaviour, cockfighting, has, been, banned, in, many, countries, during, the, last, century, on, the, grounds, of, cruelty, to, animals, ducks, are, medium, sized, aquatic, birds, with, broad, bills, eyes, on, the, side, of, the, head, fairly, long, necks, short, legs, set, far, back, on, the, body, and, webbed, feet, males, known, as, drakes, are, often, larger, than, females, known, as, hens, and, are, differently, coloured, in, some, breeds, domestic, ducks, are, omnivores, eating, a, variety, of, animal, and, plant, materials, such, as, aquatic, insects, molluscs, worms, small, amphibians, waterweeds, and, grasses, they, feed, in, shallow, water, by, dabbling, with, their, heads, underwater, and, their, tails, upended, most, domestic, ducks, are, too, heavy, to, fly, and, they, are, social, birds, preferring, to, live, and, move, around, together, in, groups, they, keep, their, plumage, waterproof, by, preening, a, process, that, spreads, the, secretions, of, the, preen, gland, over, their, feathers, clay, models, of, ducks, found, in, china, dating, back, to, 4000, bc, may, indicate, the, domestication, of, ducks, took, place, there, during, the, yangshao, culture, even, if, this, is, not, the, case, domestication, of, the, duck, took, place, in, the, far, east, at, least, 1500, years, earlier, than, in, the, west, lucius, columella, writing, in, the, first, century, bc, advised, those, who, sought, to, rear, ducks, to, collect, wildfowl, eggs, and, put, them, under, a, broody, hen, because, when, raised, in, this, way, the, ducks, lay, aside, their, wild, nature, and, without, hesitation, breed, when, shut, up, in, the, bird, pen, despite, this, ducks, did, not, appear, in, agricultural, texts, in, western, europe, until, about, 810, ad, when, they, began, to, be, mentioned, alongside, geese, chickens, and, peafowl, as, being, used, for, rental, payments, made, by, tenants, to, landowners, it, is, widely, agreed, that, the, mallard, anas, platyrhynchos, is, the, ancestor, of, all, breeds, of, domestic, duck, with, the, exception, of, the, muscovy, duck, cairina, moschata, which, is, not, closely, related, to, other, ducks, ducks, are, farmed, mainly, for, their, meat, eggs, and, down, as, is, the, case, with, chickens, various, breeds, have, been, developed, selected, for, egg, laying, ability, fast, growth, and, a, well, covered, carcase, the, most, common, commercial, breed, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, is, the, pekin, duck, which, can, lay, 200, eggs, a, year, and, can, reach, a, weight, of, 3, 5, kg, 7, lb, 11, oz, in, 44, days, in, the, western, world, ducks, are, not, as, popular, as, chickens, because, the, latter, produce, larger, quantities, of, white, lean, meat, and, are, easier, to, keep, intensively, making, the, price, of, chicken, meat, lower, than, that, of, duck, meat, while, popular, in, haute, cuisine, duck, appears, less, frequently, in, the, mass, market, food, industry, however, things, are, different, in, the, east, ducks, are, more, popular, there, than, chickens, and, are, mostly, still, herded, in, the, traditional, way, and, selected, for, their, ability, to, find, sufficient, food, in, harvested, rice, fields, and, other, wet, environments, the, greylag, goose, anser, anser, was, domesticated, by, the, egyptians, at, least, 3000, years, ago, and, a, different, wild, species, the, swan, goose, anser, cygnoides, domesticated, in, siberia, about, a, thousand, years, later, is, known, as, a, chinese, goose, the, two, hybridise, with, each, other, and, the, large, knob, at, the, base, of, the, beak, a, noticeable, feature, of, the, chinese, goose, is, present, to, a, varying, extent, in, these, hybrids, the, hybrids, are, fertile, and, have, resulted, in, several, of, the, modern, breeds, despite, their, early, domestication, geese, have, never, gained, the, commercial, importance, of, chickens, and, ducks, domestic, geese, are, much, larger, than, their, wild, counterparts, and, tend, to, have, thick, necks, an, upright, posture, and, large, bodies, with, broad, rear, ends, the, greylag, derived, birds, are, large, and, fleshy, and, used, for, meat, while, the, chinese, geese, have, smaller, frames, and, are, mainly, used, for, egg, production, the, fine, down, of, both, is, valued, for, use, in, pillows, and, padded, garments, they, forage, on, grass, and, weeds, supplementing, this, with, small, invertebrates, and, one, of, the, attractions, of, rearing, geese, is, their, ability, to, grow, and, thrive, on, a, grass, based, system, they, are, very, gregarious, and, have, good, memories, and, can, be, allowed, to, roam, widely, in, the, knowledge, that, they, will, return, home, by, dusk, the, chinese, goose, is, more, aggressive, and, noisy, than, other, geese, and, can, be, used, as, a, guard, animal, to, warn, of, intruders, the, flesh, of, meat, geese, is, dark, coloured, and, high, in, protein, but, they, deposit, fat, subcutaneously, although, this, fat, contains, mostly, monounsaturated, fatty, acids, the, birds, are, killed, either, around, 10, or, about, 24, weeks, between, these, ages, problems, with, dressing, the, carcase, occur, because, of, the, presence, of, developing, pin, feathers, in, some, countries, geese, and, ducks, are, force, fed, to, produce, livers, with, an, exceptionally, high, fat, content, for, the, production, of, foie, gras, over, 75, of, world, production, of, this, product, occurs, in, france, with, lesser, industries, in, hungary, and, bulgaria, and, a, growing, production, in, china, foie, gras, is, considered, a, luxury, in, many, parts, of, the, world, but, the, process, of, feeding, the, birds, in, this, way, is, banned, in, many, countries, on, animal, welfare, grounds, turkeys, are, large, birds, their, nearest, relatives, being, the, pheasant, and, the, guineafowl, males, are, larger, than, females, and, have, spreading, fan, shaped, tails, and, distinctive, fleshy, wattles, called, a, snood, that, hang, from, the, top, of, the, beak, and, are, used, in, courtship, display, wild, turkeys, can, fly, but, seldom, do, so, preferring, to, run, with, a, long, straddling, gait, they, roost, in, trees, and, forage, on, the, ground, feeding, on, seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and, small, snakes, the, modern, domesticated, turkey, is, descended, from, one, of, six, subspecies, of, wild, turkey, meleagris, gallopavo, found, in, the, present, mexican, states, of, jalisco, guerrero, and, veracruz, pre, aztec, tribes, in, south, central, mexico, first, domesticated, the, bird, around, 800, bc, and, pueblo, indians, inhabiting, the, colorado, plateau, in, the, united, states, did, likewise, around, 200, bc, they, used, the, feathers, for, robes, blankets, and, ceremonial, purposes, more, than, 1, 000, years, later, they, became, an, important, food, source, the, first, europeans, to, encounter, the, bird, misidentified, it, as, a, guineafowl, a, bird, known, as, a, turkey, fowl, at, that, time, because, it, had, been, introduced, into, europe, via, turkey, commercial, turkeys, are, usually, reared, indoors, under, controlled, conditions, these, are, often, large, buildings, purpose, built, to, provide, ventilation, and, low, light, intensities, this, reduces, the, birds, activity, and, thereby, increases, the, rate, of, weight, gain, the, lights, can, be, switched, on, for, 24, h, day, or, a, range, of, step, wise, light, regimens, to, encourage, the, birds, to, feed, often, and, therefore, grow, rapidly, females, achieve, slaughter, weight, at, about, 15, weeks, of, age, and, males, at, about, 19, mature, commercial, birds, may, be, twice, as, heavy, as, their, wild, counterparts, many, different, breeds, have, been, developed, but, the, majority, of, commercial, birds, are, white, as, this, improves, the, appearance, of, the, dressed, carcass, the, pin, feathers, being, less, visible, turkeys, were, at, one, time, mainly, consumed, on, special, occasions, such, as, christmas, 10, million, birds, in, the, united, kingdom, or, thanksgiving, 60, million, birds, in, the, united, states, however, they, are, increasingly, becoming, part, of, the, everyday, diet, in, many, parts, of, the, world, guineafowl, originated, in, southern, africa, and, the, species, most, often, kept, as, poultry, is, the, helmeted, guineafowl, numida, meleagris, it, is, a, medium, sized, grey, or, speckled, bird, with, a, small, naked, head, with, colorful, wattles, and, a, knob, on, top, and, was, domesticated, by, the, time, of, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, guineafowl, are, hardy, sociable, birds, that, subsist, mainly, on, insects, but, also, consume, grasses, and, seeds, they, will, keep, a, vegetable, garden, clear, of, pests, and, will, eat, the, ticks, that, carry, lyme, disease, they, happily, roost, in, trees, and, give, a, loud, vocal, warning, of, the, approach, of, predators, their, flesh, and, eggs, can, be, eaten, in, the, same, way, as, chickens, young, birds, being, ready, for, the, table, at, the, age, of, about, four, months, a, squab, is, the, name, given, to, the, young, of, domestic, pigeons, that, are, destined, for, the, table, like, other, domesticated, pigeons, birds, used, for, this, purpose, are, descended, from, the, rock, dove, columba, livia, special, utility, breeds, with, desirable, characteristics, are, used, two, eggs, are, laid, and, incubated, for, about, 17, days, when, they, hatch, the, squabs, are, fed, by, both, parents, on, pigeon, s, milk, a, thick, secretion, high, in, protein, produced, by, the, crop, squabs, grow, rapidly, but, are, slow, to, fledge, and, are, ready, to, leave, the, nest, at, 26, to, 30, days, weighing, about, 500, g, 1, lb, 2, oz, by, this, time, the, adult, pigeons, will, have, laid, and, be, incubating, another, pair, of, eggs, and, a, prolific, pair, should, produce, two, squabs, every, four, weeks, during, a, breeding, season, lasting, several, months, worldwide, more, chickens, are, kept, than, any, other, type, of, poultry, with, over, 50, billion, birds, being, raised, each, year, as, a, source, of, meat, and, eggs, traditionally, such, birds, would, have, been, kept, extensively, in, small, flocks, foraging, during, the, day, and, housed, at, night, this, is, still, the, case, in, developing, countries, where, the, women, often, make, important, contributions, to, family, livelihoods, through, keeping, poultry, however, rising, world, populations, and, urbanization, have, led, to, the, bulk, of, production, being, in, larger, more, intensive, specialist, units, these, are, often, situated, close, to, where, the, feed, is, grown, or, near, to, where, the, meat, is, needed, and, result, in, cheap, safe, food, being, made, available, for, urban, communities, profitability, of, production, depends, very, much, on, the, price, of, feed, which, has, been, rising, high, feed, costs, could, limit, further, development, of, poultry, production, in, free, range, husbandry, the, birds, can, roam, freely, outdoors, for, at, least, part, of, the, day, often, this, is, in, large, enclosures, but, the, birds, have, access, to, natural, conditions, and, can, exhibit, their, normal, behaviours, a, more, intensive, system, is, yarding, in, which, the, birds, have, access, to, a, fenced, yard, and, poultry, house, at, a, higher, stocking, rate, poultry, can, also, be, kept, in, a, barn, system, with, no, access, to, the, open, air, but, with, the, ability, to, move, around, freely, inside, the, building, the, most, intensive, system, for, egg, laying, chickens, is, battery, cages, often, set, in, multiple, tiers, in, these, several, birds, share, a, small, cage, which, restricts, their, ability, to, move, around, and, behave, in, a, normal, manner, the, eggs, are, laid, on, the, floor, of, the, cage, and, roll, into, troughs, outside, for, ease, of, collection, battery, cages, for, hens, have, been, illegal, in, the, eu, since, january, 1, 2012, chickens, raised, intensively, for, their, meat, are, known, as, broilers, breeds, have, been, developed, that, can, grow, to, an, acceptable, carcass, size, 2, kg, or, 4, lb, 7, oz, in, six, weeks, or, less, broilers, grow, so, fast, their, legs, cannot, always, support, their, weight, and, their, hearts, and, respiratory, systems, may, not, be, able, to, supply, enough, oxygen, to, their, developing, muscles, mortality, rates, at, 1, are, much, higher, than, for, less, intensively, reared, laying, birds, which, take, 18, weeks, to, reach, similar, weights, processing, the, birds, is, done, automatically, with, conveyor, belt, efficiency, they, are, hung, by, their, feet, stunned, killed, bled, scalded, plucked, have, their, heads, and, feet, removed, eviscerated, washed, chilled, drained, weighed, and, packed, all, within, the, course, of, little, over, two, hours, both, intensive, and, free, range, farming, have, animal, welfare, concerns, in, intensive, systems, cannibalism, feather, pecking, and, vent, pecking, can, be, common, with, some, farmers, using, beak, trimming, as, a, preventative, measure, diseases, can, also, be, common, and, spread, rapidly, through, the, flock, in, extensive, systems, the, birds, are, exposed, to, adverse, weather, conditions, and, are, vulnerable, to, predators, and, disease, carrying, wild, birds, barn, systems, have, been, found, to, have, the, worst, bird, welfare, in, southeast, asia, a, lack, of, disease, control, in, free, range, farming, has, been, associated, with, outbreaks, of, avian, influenza, in, many, countries, national, and, regional, poultry, shows, are, held, where, enthusiasts, exhibit, their, birds, which, are, judged, on, certain, phenotypical, breed, traits, as, specified, by, their, respective, breed, standards, the, idea, of, poultry, exhibition, may, have, originated, after, cockfighting, was, made, illegal, as, a, way, of, maintaining, a, competitive, element, in, poultry, husbandry, breed, standards, were, drawn, up, for, egg, laying, meat, type, and, purely, ornamental, birds, aiming, for, uniformity, sometimes, poultry, shows, are, part, of, general, livestock, shows, and, sometimes, they, are, separate, events, such, as, the, annual, national, championship, show, in, the, united, kingdom, organised, by, the, poultry, club, of, great, britain, poultry, is, the, second, most, widely, eaten, type, of, meat, in, the, world, accounting, for, about, 30, of, total, meat, production, worldwide, compared, to, pork, at, 38, sixteen, billion, birds, are, raised, annually, for, consumption, more, than, half, of, these, in, industrialised, factory, like, production, units, global, broiler, meat, production, rose, to, 84, 6, million, tonnes, in, 2013, the, largest, producers, were, the, united, states, 20, china, 16, 6, brazil, 15, 1, and, the, european, union, 11, 3, there, are, two, distinct, models, of, production, the, european, union, supply, chain, model, seeks, to, supply, products, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, farm, of, origin, this, model, faces, the, increasing, costs, of, implementing, additional, food, safety, requirements, welfare, issues, and, environmental, regulations, in, contrast, the, united, states, model, turns, the, product, into, a, commodity, world, production, of, duck, meat, was, about, 4, 2, million, tonnes, in, 2011, with, china, producing, two, thirds, of, the, total, some, 1, 7, billion, birds, other, notable, duck, producing, countries, in, the, far, east, include, vietnam, thailand, malaysia, myanmar, indonesia, and, south, korea, 12, in, total, france, 3, 5, is, the, largest, producer, in, the, west, followed, by, other, eu, nations, 3, and, north, america, 1, 7, china, was, also, by, far, the, largest, producer, of, goose, and, guinea, fowl, meat, with, a, 94, share, of, the, 2, 6, million, tonne, global, market, global, egg, production, was, expected, to, reach, 65, 5, million, tonnes, in, 2013, surpassing, all, previous, years, between, 2000, and, 2010, egg, production, was, growing, globally, at, around, 2, per, year, but, since, then, growth, has, slowed, down, to, nearer, 1, in, 2018, egg, production, reached, 76, 7, million, tonnes, a, huge, 24, growth, since, 2008, poultry, is, available, fresh, or, frozen, as, whole, birds, or, as, joints, cuts, bone, in, or, deboned, seasoned, in, various, ways, raw, or, ready, cooked, the, meatiest, parts, of, a, bird, are, the, flight, muscles, on, its, chest, called, breast, meat, and, the, walking, muscles, on, the, legs, called, the, thigh, and, drumstick, the, wings, are, also, eaten, buffalo, wings, are, a, popular, example, in, the, united, states, and, may, be, split, into, three, segments, the, meatier, drumette, the, wingette, also, called, the, flat, and, the, wing, tip, also, called, the, flapper, in, japan, the, wing, is, frequently, separated, and, these, parts, are, referred, to, as, teba, moto, wing, base, and, teba, saki, wing, tip, dark, meat, which, avian, myologists, refer, to, as, red, muscle, is, used, for, sustained, activity, chiefly, walking, in, the, case, of, a, chicken, the, dark, color, comes, from, the, protein, myoglobin, which, plays, a, key, role, in, oxygen, uptake, and, storage, within, cells, white, muscle, in, contrast, is, suitable, only, for, short, bursts, of, activity, such, as, for, chickens, flying, thus, the, chicken, s, leg, and, thigh, meat, are, dark, while, its, breast, meat, which, makes, up, the, primary, flight, muscles, is, white, other, birds, with, breast, muscle, more, suitable, for, sustained, flight, such, as, ducks, and, geese, have, red, muscle, and, therefore, dark, meat, throughout, some, cuts, of, meat, including, poultry, expose, the, microscopic, regular, structure, of, intracellular, muscle, fibrils, which, can, diffract, light, and, produce, iridescent, colors, an, optical, phenomenon, sometimes, called, structural, coloration, as, of, 2022, no, clinical, trials, have, assessed, poultry, intake, on, human, health, poultry, meat, and, eggs, provide, nutritionally, beneficial, food, containing, protein, of, high, quality, this, is, accompanied, by, low, levels, of, fat, which, have, a, favourable, mix, of, fatty, acids, chicken, meat, contains, about, two, to, three, times, as, much, polyunsaturated, fat, as, most, types, of, red, meat, when, measured, by, weight, however, for, boneless, skinless, chicken, breast, the, amount, is, much, lower, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, of, raw, chicken, breast, contains, 2, grams, 0, 071, oz, of, fat, and, 22, grams, 0, 78, oz, of, protein, compared, to, 9, grams, 0, 32, oz, of, fat, and, 20, grams, 0, 71, oz, of, protein, for, the, same, portion, of, raw, beef, flank, steak, a, 2011, study, by, the, translational, genomics, research, institute, showed, that, 47, of, the, meat, and, poultry, sold, in, united, states, grocery, stores, was, contaminated, with, staphylococcus, aureus, and, 52, of, the, bacteria, concerned, showed, resistance, to, at, least, three, groups, of, antibiotics, thorough, cooking, of, the, product, would, kill, these, bacteria, but, a, risk, of, cross, contamination, from, improper, handling, of, the, raw, product, is, still, present, also, some, risk, is, present, for, consumers, of, poultry, meat, and, eggs, to, bacterial, infections, such, as, salmonella, and, campylobacter, poultry, products, may, become, contaminated, by, these, bacteria, during, handling, processing, marketing, or, storage, resulting, in, food, borne, illness, if, the, product, is, improperly, cooked, or, handled, in, general, avian, influenza, is, a, disease, of, birds, caused, by, bird, specific, influenza, a, virus, that, is, not, normally, transferred, to, people, however, people, in, contact, with, live, poultry, are, at, the, greatest, risk, of, becoming, infected, with, the, virus, and, this, is, of, particular, concern, in, areas, such, as, southeast, asia, where, the, disease, is, endemic, in, the, wild, bird, population, and, domestic, poultry, can, become, infected, the, virus, possibly, could, mutate, to, become, highly, virulent, and, infectious, in, humans, and, cause, an, influenza, pandemic, bacteria, can, be, grown, in, the, laboratory, on, nutrient, culture, media, but, viruses, need, living, cells, in, which, to, replicate, many, vaccines, to, infectious, diseases, can, be, grown, in, fertilised, chicken, eggs, millions, of, eggs, are, used, each, year, to, generate, the, annual, flu, vaccine, requirements, a, complex, process, that, takes, about, six, months, after, the, decision, is, made, as, to, what, strains, of, virus, to, include, in, the, new, vaccine, a, problem, with, using, eggs, for, this, purpose, is, that, people, with, egg, allergies, are, unable, to, be, immunised, but, this, disadvantage, may, be, overcome, as, new, techniques, for, cell, based, rather, than, egg, based, culture, become, available, cell, based, culture, will, also, be, useful, in, a, pandemic, when, it, may, be, difficult, to, acquire, a, sufficiently, large, quantity, of, suitable, sterile, fertile, eggs
