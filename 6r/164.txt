consanguinity, from, latin, consanguinitas, blood, relationship, is, the, characteristic, of, having, a, kinship, with, a, relative, who, is, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, many, jurisdictions, have, laws, prohibiting, people, who, are, related, by, blood, from, marrying, or, having, sexual, relations, with, each, other, the, degree, of, consanguinity, that, gives, rise, to, this, prohibition, varies, from, place, to, place, on, the, other, hand, around, 20, of, the, global, population, lives, in, areas, where, consanguinous, marriages, are, preferred, the, degree, of, relationships, are, also, used, to, determine, heirs, of, an, estate, according, to, statutes, that, govern, intestate, succession, which, also, vary, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, in, some, communities, and, time, periods, cousin, marriage, is, allowed, or, even, encouraged, in, others, it, is, taboo, and, considered, to, be, incest, the, degree, of, relative, consanguinity, can, be, illustrated, with, a, consanguinity, table, in, which, each, level, of, lineal, consanguinity, generation, or, meiosis, appears, as, a, row, and, individuals, with, a, collaterally, consanguineous, relationship, share, the, same, row, the, knot, system, is, a, numerical, notation, that, describes, consanguinity, using, the, ahnentafel, numbers, of, shared, ancestors, the, degree, of, kinship, between, two, people, may, give, rise, to, several, legal, issues, some, laws, prohibit, sexual, relations, between, closely, related, people, referred, to, as, incestuous, laws, may, also, bar, marriage, between, closely, related, people, which, are, almost, universally, prohibited, to, the, second, degree, of, consanguinity, some, jurisdictions, forbid, marriage, between, first, cousins, while, others, do, not, marriage, with, aunts, and, uncles, avunculate, marriage, is, legal, in, several, countries, consanguinity, is, also, relevant, to, inheritance, particularly, with, regard, to, intestate, succession, in, general, laws, tend, to, favor, inheritance, by, persons, closely, related, to, the, deceased, some, jurisdictions, ban, citizens, from, service, on, a, jury, on, the, basis, of, consanguinity, as, well, as, affinity, with, persons, involved, in, the, case, in, many, countries, laws, prohibiting, nepotism, ban, employment, of, or, certain, kinds, of, contracts,

followed, couples, were, forbidden, to, marry, if, they, were, within, four, degrees, of, consanguinity, around, the, ninth, century, the, church, raised, the, number, of, prohibited, degrees, to, seven, and, changed, the, method, by, which, they, were, calculated, instead, of, the, former, roman, practice, of, counting, each, generational, link, up, to, the, common, ancestor, and, then, down, again, to, the, proposed, spouse, the, new, method, computed, consanguinity, only, by, counting, back, the, number, of, generations, to, the, common, ancestor, intermarriage, was, now, prohibited, to, anyone, more, closely, related, than, seventh, cousins, which, meant, that, in, particular, the, nobility, struggled, to, find, partners, to, marry, the, pool, of, non, related, prospective, spouses, having, become, substantially, smaller, they, had, to, either, defy, the, church, s, position, or, look, elsewhere, for, eligible, marriage, candidates, in, the, roman, catholic, church, unknowingly, marrying, a, closely, consanguineous, blood, relative, was, grounds, for, a, declaration, of, nullity, but, during, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, centuries, dispensations, were, granted, with, increasing, frequency, due, to, the, thousands, of, persons, encompassed, in, the, prohibition, at, seven, degrees, and, the, hardships, this, posed, for, finding, potential, spouses, in, 1215, the, fourth, lateran, council, made, what, they, believed, was, a, necessary, change, to, canon, law, reducing, the, number, of, prohibited, degrees, of, consanguinity, from, seven, back, to, four, but, retaining, the, later, method, of, calculating, degrees, after, 1215, the, general, rule, was, that, fourth, cousins, could, marry, without, dispensation, greatly, reducing, the, need, for, dispensations, in, fourteenth, century, england, for, example, papal, dispensations, for, annulments, due, to, consanguinity, and, affinity, were, relatively, few, the, ban, on, marriage, to, minor, degrees, of, relationship, imposed, by, the, roman, catholic, church, was, met, with, heavy, criticism, in, the, croatian, society, in, the, 11th, century, which, led, to, a, schism, in, the, croatian, church, among, the, christian, habesha, highlanders, of, ethiopia, and, eritrea, the, predominantly, orthodox, christian, amhara, and, tigray, tigrinya, it, is, a, tradition, to, be, able, to, recount, one, s, paternal, ancestors, at, least, seven, generations, away, starting, from, early, childhood, because, those, with, a, common, patrilineal, ancestor, less, than, seven, generations, away, are, considered, brother, and, sister, and, may, not, marry, the, rule, is, less, strict, on, the, mother, s, side, where, the, limit, is, about, four, generations, back, but, still, determined, patrilinearly, this, rule, does, not, apply, to, muslims, or, other, ethnic, groups, the, quran, at, 4, 22, 24, states, forbidden, to, you, in, marriage, are, your, mothers, your, daughters, your, sisters, your, father, s, sisters, your, mother, s, sisters, your, brother, s, daughters, your, sister, s, daughters, therefore, the, list, of, forbidden, marriage, partners, as, read, in, the, qur, an, surah, 4, 23, does, not, include, first, cousins, muhammad, himself, married, his, first, cousin, zaynab, bint, jahsh, financial, incentives, to, discourage, consanguineous, marriages, exist, in, some, countries, mandatory, premarital, screening, for, inherited, blood, disorders, has, existed, in, the, uae, since, 2004, and, in, qatar, since, 2009, whereby, couples, with, positive, results, will, not, receive, their, marriage, grant, genetically, consanguinity, derives, from, the, reduction, in, variation, due, to, meiosis, that, occurs, because, of, the, smaller, number, of, near, ancestors, since, all, humans, share, between, 99, 6, and, 99, 9, of, their, genome, consanguinity, only, affects, a, very, small, part, of, the, sequence, if, two, siblings, have, a, child, the, child, has, only, two, rather, than, four, grandparents, in, these, circumstances, the, probability, is, increased, that, the, child, will, inherit, two, copies, of, a, harmful, recessive, gene, allele, rather, than, only, one, which, is, less, likely, to, have, harmful, effects, genetic, consanguinity, is, expressed, as, defined, in, 1922, by, wright, with, the, coefficient, of, relationship, r, where, r, is, defined, as, the, fraction, of, homozygous, due, to, the, consanguinity, under, discussion, thus, a, parent, and, child, pair, has, a, value, of, r, 0, 5, sharing, 50, of, dna, siblings, have, a, value, of, r, 0, 5, a, parent, s, sibling, has, r, 0, 25, 25, of, dna, and, first, cousins, have, r, 0, 125, 12, 5, of, dna, these, are, often, expressed, in, terms, of, a, percentage, of, shared, dna, but, can, be, also, popularly, referred, to, as, of, genes, although, that, terminology, is, technically, incorrect, as, a, working, definition, unions, contracted, between, persons, biologically, related, as, second, cousins, or, closer, r, 0, 03125, are, categorized, as, consanguineous, this, arbitrary, limit, has, been, chosen, because, the, genetic, influence, in, marriages, between, couples, related, to, a, lesser, degree, would, usually, be, expected, to, differ, only, slightly, from, that, observed, in, the, general, population, globally, it, is, estimated, that, at, least, 8, 5, of, children, have, consanguineous, parents, in, clinical, genetics, consanguinity, is, defined, as, a, union, between, two, individuals, who, are, related, as, second, cousins, or, closer, with, the, inbreeding, coefficient, f, equal, or, higher, than, 0, 0156, where, f, represents, the, proportion, of, genetic, loci, at, which, the, child, of, a, consanguineous, couple, might, inherit, identical, gene, copies, from, both, parents, it, is, common, to, identify, one, s, first, and, second, degree, cousins, and, sometimes, third, degree, cousins, it, is, seldom, possible, to, identify, fourth, degree, cousins, since, few, people, can, trace, their, full, family, tree, back, more, than, four, generations, nor, is, it, considered, important, since, fourth, cousins, tend, to, be, genetically, no, more, similar, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, any, other, individual, from, the, same, region, reasons, favoring, consanguinous, marriage, have, been, listed, as, higher, compatibility, between, husband, and, wife, sharing, same, social, relationships, couples, stability, enforcing, family, solidarity, easier, financial, negotiations, and, others, 187, consanguinity, is, a, deeply, rooted, phenomenon, in, 20, of, the, world, population, mostly, in, the, middle, east, west, asia, and, north, africa, globally, the, most, common, form, of, consanguineous, union, is, between, first, cousins, in, which, the, spouses, share, 1, 8, of, their, genes, inherited, from, a, common, ancestor, and, so, their, progeny, are, homozygous, or, more, correctly, autozygous, at, 1, 16, of, all, loci, r, 0, 0625, due, to, variation, in, geographical, and, ethnic, background, and, the, loci, chosen, to, genotype, there, is, some, 2, 4, variation, expected, historically, some, european, nobles, cited, a, close, degree, of, consanguinity, when, they, required, convenient, grounds, for, divorce, especially, in, contexts, where, religious, doctrine, forbade, the, voluntary, dissolution, of, an, unhappy, or, childless, marriage, in, the, arab, world, the, practice, of, marrying, relatives, is, common, according, to, the, centre, for, arabic, genomic, research, between, 40, and, 54, of, uae, nationals, marriages, are, between, family, members, up, from, 39, in, the, previous, generation, between, 21, and, 28, of, marriages, of, uae, nationals, were, between, first, cousins, consanguineous, marriage, is, much, less, prevalent, in, christian, arabs, as, they, do, not, practice, arranged, marriages, additionally, an, indult, dispensation, is, required, to, marriages, contracted, between, first, cousins, or, closer, in, arab, christian, denominations, in, communion, with, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, greek, orthodox, church, there, are, no, similar, regulations, that, apply, to, first, cousin, marriages, in, the, coptic, orthodox, church, in, egypt, around, 40, of, the, population, marry, a, cousin, a, 1992, survey, in, jordan, found, that, 32, were, married, to, a, first, cousin, a, further, 17, 3, were, married, to, more, distant, relatives, 67, of, marriages, in, saudi, arabia, are, between, close, relatives, as, are, 54, of, all, marriages, in, kuwait, whereas, 18, of, all, lebanese, were, between, blood, relatives, the, incidence, of, consanguinity, was, 54, 3, among, kuwaiti, natives, and, higher, among, bedouins, it, has, been, estimated, that, 55, of, marriages, between, pakistani, muslim, immigrants, in, the, united, kingdom, are, between, first, cousins, where, preferential, patrilateral, parallel, cousin, marriage, i, e, a, man, marrying, the, daughter, of, his, father, s, brother, is, favored, double, first, cousins, are, descended, from, two, pairs, of, siblings, and, have, the, same, genetic, similarity, as, half, siblings, in, unions, between, double, first, cousins, the, highest, inbreeding, coefficients, are, reached, with, an, f, of, 0, 125, for, example, among, arabs, and, uncle, niece, marriages, in, south, india, the, early, days, of, colonization, particularly, from, 1660, to, 1680, gave, french, canadians, genetic, traits, that, are, still, present, today, thanks, to, the, isolation, and, low, population, of, the, early, colony, this, has, led, to, the, province, having, a, higher, rate, of, hypercholesterolemia, tyrosinemia, spastic, ataxia, intestinal, atresia, myotonic, dystrophy, etc, in, the, population, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, the, phenomenon, of, inbreeding, increases, the, level, of, homozygotes, for, autosomal, genetic, disorders, and, generally, leads, to, a, decreased, biological, fitness, of, a, population, known, as, inbreeding, depression, a, major, objective, in, clinical, studies, while, the, risks, of, inbreeding, are, well, known, informing, minority, group, families, with, a, tradition, of, endogamy, and, changing, their, behavior, is, a, challenging, task, for, genetic, counseling, in, the, health, care, system, the, offspring, of, consanguineous, relationships, are, at, greater, risk, of, certain, genetic, disorders, autosomal, recessive, disorders, occur, in, individuals, who, are, homozygous, for, a, particular, recessive, gene, mutation, this, means, that, they, carry, two, copies, alleles, of, the, same, gene, except, in, certain, rare, circumstances, new, mutations, or, uniparental, disomy, both, parents, of, an, individual, with, such, a, disorder, will, be, carriers, of, the, gene, such, carriers, are, not, affected, and, will, not, display, any, signs, that, they, are, carriers, and, so, may, be, unaware, that, they, carry, the, mutated, gene, as, relatives, share, a, proportion, of, their, genes, it, is, much, more, likely, that, related, parents, will, be, carriers, of, an, autosomal, recessive, gene, and, therefore, their, children, are, at, a, higher, risk, of, an, autosomal, recessive, disorder, the, extent, to, which, the, risk, increases, depends, on, the, degree, of, genetic, relationship, between, the, parents, so, the, risk, is, greater, in, mating, relationships, where, the, parents, are, close, relatives, but, for, relationships, between, more, distant, relatives, such, as, second, cousins, the, risk, is, lower, although, still, greater, than, the, general, population, consanguinity, in, a, population, increases, its, susceptibility, to, infectious, pathogens, such, as, tuberculosis, and, hepatitis, but, may, decrease, its, susceptibility, to, malaria, and, other, pathogens
