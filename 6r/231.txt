bisexuality, is, a, romantic, or, sexual, attraction, or, behavior, toward, both, males, and, females, gender, binary, to, more, than, one, gender, or, to, both, people, of, the, same, gender, and, different, genders, it, may, also, be, defined, to, include, romantic, or, sexual, attraction, to, people, regardless, of, their, sex, or, gender, identity, which, is, also, known, as, pansexuality, the, term, bisexuality, is, mainly, used, for, people, that, have, both, heterosexual, and, homosexual, attraction, bisexuality, is, one, of, the, three, main, classifications, of, sexual, orientation, along, with, heterosexuality, and, homosexuality, all, of, which, exist, on, the, heterosexual, homosexual, continuum, a, bisexual, identity, does, not, necessarily, equate, to, equal, sexual, attraction, to, both, sexes, commonly, people, who, have, a, distinct, but, not, exclusive, sexual, preference, for, one, sex, over, the, other, also, identify, themselves, as, bisexual, scientists, do, not, know, the, exact, cause, of, sexual, orientation, but, they, theorize, that, it, is, caused, by, a, complex, interplay, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, influences, and, do, not, view, it, as, a, choice, although, no, single, theory, on, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, has, yet, gained, widespread, support, scientists, favor, biologically, based, theories, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, bisexuality, has, been, observed, in, various, human, societies, as, well, as, elsewhere, in, the, animal, kingdom, throughout, recorded, history, the, term, bisexuality, like, the, terms, hetero, and, homosexuality, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, by, charles, gilbert, chaddock, bisexuality, is, variously, defined, as, romantic, or, sexual, attraction, to, both, males, and, females, to, more, than, one, gender, or, attraction, to, both, people, of, the, same, gender, and, different, genders, the, american, psychological, association, states, that, sexual, orientation, falls, along, a, continuum, in, other, words, someone, does, not, have, to, be, exclusively, homosexual, or, heterosexual, but, can, feel, varying, degrees, of, both, sexual, orientation, develops, across, a, person, s, lifetime, different, people, realize, at, different, points, in, their, lives, that, they, are, heterosexual, bisexual, or, homosexual, attraction, can, take, numerous, forms, for, bisexuals, such, as, sexual, romantic, emotional, or, physical, sexual, attraction, behavior, and, identity, may, also, be, incongruent, as, sexual, attraction, or, behavior, may, not, necessarily, be, consistent, with, identity, some, individuals, identify, themselves, as, heterosexual, homosexual, or, bisexual, without, having, had, any, sexual, experience, others, have, had, homosexual, experiences, but, do, not, consider, themselves, to, be, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, likewise, self, identified, gay, or, lesbian, individuals, may, occasionally, sexually, interact, with, members, of, the, opposite, sex, but, do, not, identify, as, bisexual, the, terms, queer, polysexual, heteroflexible, homoflexible, men, who, have, sex, with, men, and, women, who, have, sex, with, women, may, also, be, used, to, describe, sexual, identity, or, identify, sexual, behavior, some, sources, state, that, bisexuality, encompasses, romantic, or, sexual, attraction, to, all, gender, identities, or, that, it, is, romantic, or, sexual, attraction, to, a, person, irrespective, of, that, person, s, biological, sex, or, gender, equating, it, to, or, rendering, it, interchangeable, with, pansexuality, the, concept, of, pansexuality, deliberately, rejects, the, gender, binary, the, notion, of, two, genders, and, indeed, of, specific, sexual, orientations, as, pansexual, people, are, open, to, relationships, with, people, who, do, not, identify, as, strictly, men, or, women, sometimes, the, phrase, bisexual, umbrella, or, bisexual, community, is, used, to, describe, any, non, monosexual, behaviors, attractions, and, identities, usually, for, purposes, of, collective, action, and, challenging, monosexist, cultural, assumptions, the, term, bisexual, community, includes, those, who, identify, as, bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, biromantic, polysexual, or, sexually, fluid, the, bisexual, activist, robyn, ochs, defines, bisexuality, as, the, potential, to, be, attracted, romantically, and, or, sexually, to, people, of, more, than, one, sex, and, or, gender, not, necessarily, at, the, same, time, not, necessarily, in, the, same, way, and, not, necessarily, to, the, same, degree, according, to, rosario, schrimshaw, hunter, braun, 2006, the, development, of, a, lesbian, gay, or, bisexual, lgb, sexual, identity, is, a, complex, and, often, difficult, process, unlike, members, of, other, minority, groups, e, g, ethnic, and, racial, minorities, most, lgb, individuals, are, not, raised, in, a, community, of, similar, others, from, whom, they, learn, about, their, identity, and, who, reinforce, and, support, that, identity, rather, lgb, individuals, are, often, raised, in, communities, that, are, either, ignorant, of, or, openly, hostile, toward, homosexuality, bisexuality, as, a, transitional, identity, has, also, been, examined, in, a, longitudinal, study, about, sexual, identity, development, among, lesbian, gay, and, bisexual, lgb, youths, rosario, et, al, found, evidence, of, both, considerable, consistency, and, change, in, lgb, sexual, identity, over, time, youths, who, had, identified, as, both, gay, lesbian, and, bisexual, prior, to, baseline, were, approximately, three, times, more, likely, to, identify, as, gay, lesbian, than, as, bisexual, at, subsequent, assessments, of, youths, who, had, identified, only, as, bisexual, at, earlier, assessments, 60, to, 70, percent, continued, to, thus, identify, while, approximately, 30, to, 40, percent, assumed, a, gay, lesbian, identity, over, time, rosario, et, al, suggested, that, although, there, were, youths, who, consistently, self, identified, as, bisexual, throughout, the, study, for, other, youths, a, bisexual, identity, served, as, a, transitional, identity, to, a, subsequent, gay, lesbian, identity, by, contrast, a, longitudinal, study, by, lisa, m, diamond, which, followed, women, identifying, as, lesbian, bisexual, or, unlabeled, found, that, more, women, adopted, bisexual, unlabeled, identities, than, relinquished, these, identities, over, a, ten, year, period, the, study, also, found, that, bisexual, unlabeled, women, had, stable, overall, distributions, of, same, sex, other, sex, attractions, diamond, has, also, studied, male, bisexuality, noting, that, survey, research, found, almost, as, many, men, transitioned, at, some, point, from, a, gay, identity, to, a, bisexual, queer, or, unlabeled, one, as, did, from, a, bisexual, identity, to, a, gay, identity, there, may, also, be, a, difference, between, sexual, and, romantic, attractions, in, bisexuals, over, time, one, study, found, that, in, the, short, term, bisexual, men, and, women, were, much, more, likely, to, change, their, sexual, behavior, than, heterosexual, or, homosexual, individuals, bisexual, men, were, less, likely, to, have, a, change, in, romantic, attraction, but, those, that, did, were, more, likely, to, have, a, greater, change, than, in, sexual, feelings, while, bisexual, women, were, more, likely, than, bisexual, men, to, have, a, change, in, romantic, attraction, this, suggests, that, sexual, and, romantic, attraction, is, not, fixed, for, bisexual, individuals, and, changes, over, time, in, the, 1940s, the, zoologist, alfred, kinsey, created, a, scale, to, measure, the, continuum, of, sexual, orientation, from, heterosexuality, to, homosexuality, kinsey, studied, human, sexuality, and, argued, that, people, have, the, capability, of, being, hetero, or, homosexual, even, if, this, trait, does, not, present, itself, in, the, current, circumstances, the, kinsey, scale, is, used, to, describe, a, person, s, sexual, experience, or, response, at, a, given, time, it, ranges, from, 0, meaning, exclusively, heterosexual, to, 6, meaning, exclusively, homosexual, people, who, rank, anywhere, from, 2, to, 4, are, often, considered, bisexual, they, are, often, not, fully, one, extreme, or, the, other, the, sociologists, martin, s, weinberg, and, colin, j, williams, write, that, in, principle, people, who, rank, anywhere, from, one, to, five, could, be, considered, bisexual, psychologist, jim, mcknight, writes, that, while, the, idea, that, bisexuality, is, a, form, of, sexual, orientation, intermediate, between, homosexuality, and, heterosexuality, is, implicit, in, the, kinsey, scale, that, conception, has, been, severely, challenged, since, the, publication, of, homosexualities, 1978, by, weinberg, and, the, psychologist, alan, p, bell, the, kinsey, scale, is, criticized, for, various, reasons, one, of, the, main, reasons, is, the, inverse, relation, in, attraction, to, males, and, females, that, the, kinsey, scale, represents, the, kinsey, scale, says, that, having, a, higher, level, attraction, to, one, gender, results, in, less, attraction, to, the, other, which, some, studies, do, not, support, this, aspect, of, the, kinsey, scale, can, impact, the, results, of, studies, that, utilize, the, scale, as, there, is, a, biological, difference, between, bisexuals, and, gay, people, scientific, estimates, as, to, the, prevalence, of, bisexuality, have, varied, from, 0, 7, to, 8, percent, the, janus, report, on, sexual, behavior, published, in, 1993, concluded, that, 5, percent, of, men, and, 3, percent, of, women, considered, themselves, bisexual, while, 4, percent, of, men, and, 2, percent, of, women, considered, themselves, homosexual, a, 2002, survey, in, the, united, states, by, the, national, center, for, health, statistics, found, that, 1, 8, percent, of, men, ages, 18, 44, considered, themselves, bisexual, 2, 3, percent, homosexual, and, 3, 9, percent, as, something, else, the, same, study, found, that, 2, 8, percent, of, women, ages, 18, 44, considered, themselves, bisexual, 1, 3, percent, homosexual, and, 3, 8, percent, as, something, else, in, 2007, an, article, in, the, health, section, of, the, new, york, times, stated, that, 1, 5, percent, of, american, women, and, 1, 7, percent, of, american, men, identify, themselves, bisexual, also, in, 2007, it, was, reported, that, 14, 4, percent, of, young, us, women, identified, themselves, as, not, strictly, heterosexual, with, 5, 6, percent, of, the, men, identifying, as, gay, or, bisexual, a, study, in, the, journal, biological, psychology, in, 2011, reported, that, there, were, men, who, identify, themselves, as, bisexuals, and, who, were, aroused, by, both, men, and, women, in, the, first, large, scale, government, survey, measuring, americans, sexual, orientation, the, nhis, reported, in, july, 2014, that, only, 0, 7, percent, of, americans, identify, as, bisexual, a, collection, of, recent, western, surveys, finds, that, about, 10, of, women, and, 4, of, men, identify, as, mostly, heterosexual, 1, of, women, and, 0, 5, of, men, as, bisexual, and, 0, 4, of, women, and, 0, 5, of, men, as, mostly, homosexual, 55, across, cultures, there, is, some, variance, in, the, prevalence, of, bisexual, behavior, but, there, is, no, persuasive, evidence, that, there, is, much, variance, in, the, rate, of, same, sex, attraction, the, world, health, organization, estimates, a, worldwide, prevalence, of, men, who, have, sex, with, men, between, 3, and, 16, many, of, whom, have, sex, with, women, as, well, a, yougov, survey, found, that, the, proportion, of, young, adults, living, in, the, united, kingdom, identifying, as, bisexual, surged, 14, from, 2015, to, 2019, there, is, no, consensus, among, scientists, about, the, exact, reasons, that, an, individual, develops, a, heterosexual, bisexual, or, homosexual, orientation, although, scientists, favor, biological, models, for, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, they, do, not, believe, that, the, development, of, sexual, orientation, is, the, result, of, any, one, factor, they, generally, believe, that, it, is, determined, by, a, complex, interplay, of, biological, and, environmental, factors, and, is, shaped, at, an, early, age, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, which, suggests, parenting, or, early, childhood, experiences, play, a, role, with, regard, to, sexual, orientation, most, scientists, do, not, believe, that, sexual, orientation, is, a, choice, that, can, be, changed, at, will, in, 2000, american, psychiatric, association, stated, to, date, there, are, no, replicated, scientific, studies, supporting, any, specific, biological, etiology, for, homosexuality, similarly, no, specific, psychosocial, or, family, dynamic, cause, for, homosexuality, has, been, identified, including, histories, of, childhood, sexual, abuse, research, into, how, sexual, orientation, may, be, determined, by, genetic, or, other, prenatal, factors, plays, a, role, in, political, and, social, debates, about, homosexuality, and, also, raises, fears, about, genetic, profiling, and, prenatal, testing, magnus, hirschfeld, argued, that, adult, sexual, orientation, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, the, bisexual, nature, of, the, developing, fetus, he, believed, that, in, every, embryo, there, is, one, rudimentary, neutral, center, for, attraction, to, males, and, another, for, attraction, to, females, in, most, fetuses, the, center, for, attraction, to, the, opposite, sex, developed, while, the, center, for, attraction, to, the, same, sex, regressed, but, in, fetuses, that, became, homosexual, the, reverse, occurred, simon, levay, has, criticized, hirschfeld, s, theory, of, an, early, bisexual, stage, of, development, calling, it, confusing, levay, maintains, that, hirschfeld, failed, to, distinguish, between, saying, that, the, brain, is, sexually, undifferentiated, at, an, early, stage, of, development, and, saying, that, an, individual, actually, experiences, sexual, attraction, to, both, men, and, women, according, to, levay, hirschfeld, believed, that, in, most, bisexual, people, the, strength, of, attraction, to, the, same, sex, was, relatively, low, and, that, it, was, therefore, possible, to, restrain, its, development, in, young, people, something, hirschfeld, supported, hirschfeld, created, a, ten, point, scale, to, measure, the, strength, of, sexual, desire, with, the, direction, of, desire, being, represented, by, the, letters, a, for, heterosexuality, b, for, homosexuality, and, a, b, for, bisexuality, on, this, scale, someone, who, was, a3, b9, would, be, weakly, attracted, to, the, opposite, sex, and, very, strongly, attracted, to, the, same, sex, an, a0, b0, would, be, asexual, and, an, a10, b10, would, be, very, attracted, to, both, sexes, levay, compares, hirschfeld, s, scale, to, that, developed, by, kinsey, decades, later, sigmund, freud, the, founder, of, psychoanalysis, believed, that, every, human, being, is, bisexual, in, the, sense, of, incorporating, general, attributes, of, both, sexes, in, his, view, this, was, true, anatomically, and, therefore, also, psychologically, with, sexual, attraction, to, both, sexes, being, an, aspect, of, this, psychological, bisexuality, freud, believed, that, in, the, course, of, sexual, development, the, masculine, side, of, this, bisexual, disposition, would, normally, become, dominant, in, men, and, the, feminine, side, in, women, but, that, all, adults, still, have, desires, derived, from, both, the, masculine, and, the, feminine, sides, of, their, natures, freud, did, not, claim, that, everyone, is, bisexual, in, the, sense, of, feeling, the, same, level, of, sexual, attraction, to, men, and, women, freud, s, belief, in, innate, bisexuality, was, rejected, by, s, ndor, rad, in, 1940, and, following, rad, by, many, later, psychoanalysts, rad, argued, that, there, is, no, biological, bisexuality, in, humans, alan, p, bell, martin, s, weinberg, and, sue, kiefer, hammersmith, reported, in, sexual, preference, 1981, that, sexual, preference, was, much, less, strongly, connected, with, pre, adult, sexual, feelings, among, bisexuals, than, it, was, among, heterosexuals, and, homosexuals, based, on, this, and, other, findings, they, suggested, that, bisexuality, is, more, influenced, by, social, and, sexual, learning, than, is, exclusive, homosexuality, letitia, anne, peplau, et, al, wrote, that, while, bell, et, al, s, view, that, biological, factors, may, be, more, influential, on, homosexuality, than, on, bisexuality, might, seem, plausible, it, has, not, been, directly, tested, and, appears, to, conflict, with, available, evidence, such, as, that, concerning, prenatal, hormone, exposure, human, bisexuality, has, mainly, been, studied, alongside, homosexuality, van, wyk, and, geist, argue, that, this, is, a, problem, for, sexuality, research, because, the, few, studies, that, have, observed, bisexuals, separately, have, found, that, bisexuals, are, often, different, from, both, heterosexuals, and, homosexuals, furthermore, bisexuality, does, not, always, represent, a, halfway, point, between, the, dichotomy, research, indicates, that, bisexuality, is, influenced, by, biological, cognitive, and, cultural, variables, in, interaction, and, this, leads, to, different, types, of, bisexuality, in, the, current, debate, around, influences, on, sexual, orientation, biological, explanations, have, been, questioned, by, social, scientists, particularly, by, feminists, who, encourage, women, to, make, conscious, decisions, about, their, life, and, sexuality, a, difference, in, attitude, between, homosexual, men, and, women, has, also, been, reported, with, men, more, likely, to, regard, their, sexuality, as, biological, reflecting, the, universal, male, experience, in, this, culture, not, the, complexities, of, the, lesbian, world, there, is, also, evidence, that, women, s, sexuality, may, be, more, strongly, affected, by, cultural, and, contextual, factors, american, academic, camille, paglia, has, promoted, bisexuality, as, an, ideal, american, harvard, professor, marjorie, garber, made, an, academic, case, for, bisexuality, with, her, 1995, book, vice, versa, bisexuality, and, the, eroticism, of, everyday, life, in, which, she, argued, that, most, people, would, be, bisexual, if, not, for, repression, and, other, factors, such, as, lack, of, sexual, opportunity, levay, s, 1991, examination, at, autopsy, of, 18, homosexual, men, 1, bisexual, man, 16, presumably, heterosexual, men, and, 6, presumably, heterosexual, women, found, that, the, inah, 3, nucleus, of, the, anterior, hypothalamus, of, homosexual, men, was, smaller, than, that, of, heterosexual, men, and, closer, in, size, of, heterosexual, women, although, grouped, with, homosexuals, the, inah, 3, size, of, the, one, bisexual, subject, was, similar, to, that, of, the, heterosexual, men, some, evidence, supports, the, concept, of, biological, precursors, of, bisexual, orientation, in, genetic, males, according, to, john, money, 1988, genetic, males, with, an, extra, y, chromosome, are, more, likely, to, be, bisexual, paraphilic, and, impulsive, some, evolutionary, psychologists, have, argued, that, same, sex, attraction, does, not, have, adaptive, value, because, it, has, no, association, with, potential, reproductive, success, instead, bisexuality, can, be, due, to, normal, variation, in, brain, plasticity, more, recently, it, has, been, suggested, that, same, sex, alliances, may, have, helped, males, climb, the, social, hierarchy, giving, access, to, females, and, reproductive, opportunities, same, sex, allies, could, have, helped, females, to, move, to, the, safer, and, resource, richer, center, of, the, group, which, increased, their, chances, of, raising, their, offspring, successfully, likewise, barron, and, hare, suggest, that, same, sex, attraction, is, a, spandrel, of, prosocial, traits, which, has, been, consistently, selected, among, humans, over, time, these, prosocial, traits, include, social, affiliation, communication, integration, as, well, as, reduced, reactive, aggression, among, members, of, the, same, sex, david, buss, criticized, the, alliance, hypothesis, stating, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, most, young, men, in, most, cultures, use, sexual, behavior, to, establish, alliances, instead, the, norm, is, for, same, sex, alliances, to, not, be, accompanied, by, any, sexual, activity, additionally, he, states, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, men, who, engage, in, bisexual, behavior, do, better, than, other, men, at, forming, alliances, or, ascending, in, status, barron, and, hare, state, that, there, are, ethnographic, examples, of, same, sex, activity, being, used, to, strengthen, social, bonds, among, males, and, females, brendan, zietsch, of, the, queensland, institute, of, medical, research, proposes, the, alternative, theory, that, men, exhibiting, female, traits, become, more, attractive, to, females, and, are, thus, more, likely, to, mate, provided, the, genes, involved, do, not, drive, them, to, complete, rejection, of, heterosexuality, barron, and, hare, concur, and, argue, that, this, is, one, of, the, reasons, why, bisexuality, is, more, common, than, exclusive, homosexuality, among, animal, populations, including, human, populations, however, this, is, underreported, due, to, enforced, binary, dichotomies, in, previous, research, and, cultural, factors, also, in, a, 2008, study, its, authors, stated, that, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, human, sexual, orientation, is, genetically, influenced, so, it, is, not, known, how, homosexuality, which, tends, to, lower, reproductive, success, is, maintained, in, the, population, at, a, relatively, high, frequency, they, hypothesized, that, while, genes, predisposing, to, homosexuality, reduce, homosexuals, reproductive, success, they, may, confer, some, advantage, in, heterosexuals, who, carry, them, and, their, results, suggested, that, genes, predisposing, to, homosexuality, may, confer, a, mating, advantage, in, heterosexuals, which, could, help, explain, the, evolution, and, maintenance, of, homosexuality, in, the, population, barron, and, hare, say, that, this, finding, is, only, shown, in, western, european, societies, with, said, finding, being, weakly, supported, in, other, populations, or, cultures, masculinization, of, women, and, hypermasculinization, of, men, has, been, a, central, theme, in, sexual, orientation, research, there, are, several, studies, suggesting, that, bisexuals, have, a, high, degree, of, masculinization, latorre, and, wendenberg, 1983, found, differing, personality, characteristics, for, bisexual, heterosexual, and, homosexual, women, bisexuals, were, found, to, have, fewer, personal, insecurities, than, heterosexuals, and, homosexuals, this, finding, described, bisexuals, as, self, assured, and, less, likely, to, have, mental, instabilities, the, confidence, of, a, secure, identity, consistently, translated, to, more, masculinity, than, other, subjects, this, study, did, not, explore, societal, norms, prejudices, or, the, feminization, of, homosexual, males, in, a, research, comparison, published, in, the, journal, of, the, association, for, research, in, otolaryngology, women, usually, have, a, better, hearing, sensitivity, than, males, assumed, by, researchers, as, a, genetic, disposition, connected, to, child, bearing, homosexual, and, bisexual, women, have, been, found, to, have, a, hypersensitivity, to, sound, in, comparison, to, heterosexual, women, suggesting, a, genetic, disposition, to, not, tolerate, high, pitched, tones, while, heterosexual, homosexual, and, bisexual, men, have, been, found, to, exhibit, similar, patterns, of, hearing, there, was, a, notable, differential, in, a, sub, group, of, males, identified, as, hyperfeminized, homosexual, males, who, exhibited, test, results, similar, to, heterosexual, women, the, prenatal, hormonal, theory, of, sexual, orientation, suggests, that, people, who, are, exposed, to, excess, levels, of, sex, hormones, have, masculinized, brains, and, show, increased, homosexuality, or, bisexuality, studies, providing, evidence, for, the, masculinization, of, the, brain, have, however, not, been, conducted, to, date, research, on, special, conditions, such, as, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, cah, and, exposure, to, diethylstilbestrol, des, indicate, that, prenatal, exposure, to, respectively, excess, testosterone, and, estrogens, are, associated, with, female, female, sex, fantasies, in, adults, both, effects, are, associated, with, bisexuality, rather, than, homosexuality, there, is, research, evidence, that, the, digit, ratio, of, the, length, of, the, 2nd, and, 4th, digits, index, finger, and, ring, finger, is, somewhat, negatively, related, to, prenatal, testosterone, and, positively, to, estrogen, studies, measuring, the, fingers, found, a, statistically, significant, skew, in, the, 2d, 4d, ratio, long, ring, finger, towards, homosexuality, with, an, even, lower, ratio, in, bisexuals, it, is, suggested, that, exposure, to, high, prenatal, testosterone, and, low, prenatal, estrogen, concentrations, is, one, cause, of, homosexuality, whereas, exposure, to, very, high, testosterone, levels, may, be, associated, with, bisexuality, because, testosterone, in, general, is, important, for, sexual, differentiation, this, view, offers, an, alternative, to, the, suggestion, that, male, homosexuality, is, genetic, the, prenatal, hormonal, theory, suggests, that, a, homosexual, orientation, results, from, exposure, to, excessive, testosterone, causing, an, over, masculinized, brain, this, is, contradictory, to, another, hypothesis, that, homosexual, preferences, may, be, due, to, a, feminized, brain, in, males, however, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, homosexuality, may, be, due, to, high, prenatal, levels, of, unbound, testosterone, that, results, from, a, lack, of, receptors, at, particular, brain, sites, therefore, the, brain, could, be, feminized, while, other, features, such, as, the, 2d, 4d, ratio, could, be, over, masculinized, van, wyk, and, geist, summarized, several, studies, comparing, bisexuals, with, hetero, or, homosexuals, that, have, indicated, that, bisexuals, have, higher, rates, of, sexual, activity, fantasy, or, erotic, interest, these, studies, found, that, male, and, female, bisexuals, had, more, heterosexual, fantasy, than, heterosexuals, or, homosexuals, that, bisexual, men, had, more, sexual, activities, with, women, than, did, heterosexual, men, and, that, they, masturbated, more, but, had, fewer, happy, marriages, than, heterosexuals, that, bisexual, women, had, more, orgasms, per, week, and, they, described, them, as, stronger, than, those, of, hetero, or, homosexual, women, and, that, bisexual, women, became, heterosexually, active, earlier, masturbated, and, enjoyed, masturbation, more, and, were, more, experienced, in, different, types, of, heterosexual, contact, research, suggests, that, for, most, women, high, sex, drive, is, associated, with, increased, sexual, attraction, to, both, women, and, men, for, men, however, high, sex, drive, is, associated, with, increased, attraction, to, one, sex, or, the, other, but, not, to, both, depending, on, sexual, orientation, similarly, for, most, bisexual, women, high, sex, drive, is, associated, with, increased, sexual, attraction, to, both, women, and, men, while, for, bisexual, men, high, sex, drive, is, associated, with, increased, attraction, to, one, sex, and, weakened, attraction, to, the, other, richard, a, lippa, proposed, that, there, exist, two, dimensions, of, sexual, orientation, a, gender, typicality, dimension, and, a, monosexuality, dimension, with, the, gender, typicality, dimension, being, associated, with, the, heterosexual, homosexual, distinction, while, the, sociosexuality, dimension, has, many, behavioral, effects, he, proposes, someone, who, would, be, at, any, point, in, the, heterosexual, homosexual, spectrum, will, become, bisexual, if, they, are, high, on, the, sociosexuality, dimension, this, dimension, being, associated, with, higher, sociosexuality, higher, neuroticism, lower, agreeableness, lower, honesty, humility, higher, openness, to, experience, and, a, minor, degree, of, gender, nonconformity, he, proposes, this, as, explaining, phenomena, such, as, increased, juvenile, delinquency, among, bisexuals, increased, mental, health, issues, and, substance, use, disorder, among, bisexuals, and, increased, dark, triad, traits, among, bisexual, women, critics, of, this, theory, have, described, elements, observed, as, coming, from, experiences, of, biphobia, but, lippa, counters, that, these, phenomena, are, present, even, among, heterosexual, identifying, people, with, some, same, sex, attraction, who, would, likely, be, heterosexual, passing, the, bisexual, community, also, known, as, the, bisexual, pansexual, bi, pan, fluid, or, non, monosexual, community, includes, members, of, the, lgbt, community, who, identify, as, bisexual, pansexual, or, fluid, because, some, bisexual, people, do, not, feel, that, they, fit, into, either, the, gay, or, the, heterosexual, world, and, because, they, have, a, tendency, to, be, invisible, in, public, some, bisexual, persons, are, committed, to, forming, their, own, communities, culture, and, political, movements, some, who, identify, as, bisexual, may, merge, themselves, into, either, homosexual, or, heterosexual, society, other, bisexual, people, see, this, merging, as, enforced, rather, than, voluntary, bisexual, people, can, face, exclusion, from, both, homosexual, and, heterosexual, society, on, coming, out, psychologist, beth, firestein, states, that, bisexuals, tend, to, internalize, social, tensions, related, to, their, choice, of, partners, and, feel, pressured, to, label, themselves, as, homosexuals, instead, of, occupying, the, difficult, middle, ground, where, attraction, to, people, of, both, sexes, would, defy, society, s, value, on, monogamy, these, social, tensions, and, pressure, may, affect, bisexuals, mental, health, and, specific, therapy, methods, have, been, developed, for, bisexuals, to, address, this, concern, bisexual, behaviors, are, also, associated, in, popular, culture, with, men, who, engage, in, same, sex, activity, while, otherwise, presenting, as, heterosexual, the, majority, of, such, men, said, to, be, living, on, the, down, low, do, not, self, identify, as, bisexual, however, this, may, be, a, cultural, misperception, closely, related, to, that, of, other, lgbt, individuals, who, hide, their, actual, orientation, due, to, societal, pressures, a, phenomenon, colloquially, called, being, closeted, in, the, u, s, a, 2013, pew, survey, showed, that, 28, of, bisexuals, said, that, all, or, most, of, the, important, people, in, their, life, are, aware, that, they, are, lgbt, vs, 77, of, gay, men, and, 71, of, lesbians, furthermore, when, broken, down, by, gender, only, 12, of, bisexual, men, said, that, they, were, out, vs, 33, of, bisexual, women, like, people, of, other, lgbt, sexualities, bisexuals, often, face, discrimination, in, addition, to, the, discrimination, associated, with, homophobia, bisexuals, frequently, contend, with, discrimination, from, gay, men, lesbians, and, straight, society, around, the, word, bisexual, and, bisexual, identity, itself, the, belief, that, everyone, is, bisexual, especially, women, as, opposed, to, men, or, that, bisexuality, does, not, exist, as, a, unique, identity, is, common, this, stems, from, two, views, in, the, heterosexist, view, people, are, presumed, to, be, sexually, attracted, to, the, opposite, sex, and, it, is, sometimes, reasoned, that, a, bisexual, person, is, simply, a, heterosexual, person, who, is, sexually, experimenting, in, the, monosexist, view, it, is, believed, that, people, cannot, be, bisexual, unless, they, are, equally, sexually, attracted, to, both, sexes, regulating, sexual, orientation, to, being, about, the, sex, or, gender, one, prefers, in, this, view, people, are, either, exclusively, homosexual, gay, lesbian, or, exclusively, heterosexual, straight, closeted, homosexual, people, who, wish, to, appear, heterosexual, or, heterosexuals, who, are, experimenting, with, their, sexuality, assertions, that, one, cannot, be, bisexual, unless, equally, sexually, attracted, to, both, sexes, however, are, disputed, by, various, researchers, who, have, reported, bisexuality, to, fall, on, a, continuum, like, sexuality, in, general, male, bisexuality, is, particularly, presumed, to, be, non, existent, with, sexual, fluidity, studies, adding, to, the, debate, in, 2005, researchers, gerulf, rieger, meredith, l, chivers, and, j, michael, bailey, used, penile, plethysmography, to, measure, the, arousal, of, self, identified, bisexual, men, to, pornography, involving, only, men, and, pornography, involving, only, women, participants, were, recruited, via, advertisements, in, gay, oriented, magazines, and, an, alternative, paper, they, found, that, the, self, identified, bisexual, men, in, their, sample, had, genital, arousal, patterns, similar, to, either, homosexual, or, heterosexual, men, the, authors, concluded, that, in, terms, of, behavior, and, identity, bisexual, men, clearly, exist, but, that, male, bisexuality, had, not, been, shown, to, exist, with, respect, to, arousal, or, attraction, some, researchers, hold, that, the, technique, used, in, the, study, to, measure, genital, arousal, is, too, crude, to, capture, the, richness, erotic, sensations, affection, admiration, that, constitutes, sexual, attraction, the, national, gay, and, lesbian, task, force, called, the, study, and, the, new, york, times, coverage, of, it, flawed, and, biphobic, the, american, institute, of, bisexuality, stated, that, bailey, s, study, was, misinterpreted, and, misreported, by, both, the, new, york, times, and, its, critics, in, 2011, bailey, and, other, researchers, reported, that, among, men, with, a, history, of, several, romantic, and, sexual, relationships, with, members, of, both, sexes, high, levels, of, sexual, arousal, were, found, in, response, to, both, male, and, female, sexual, imagery, the, subjects, were, recruited, from, a, craigslist, group, for, men, seeking, intimacy, with, both, members, of, a, heterosexual, couple, the, authors, said, that, this, change, in, recruitment, strategy, was, an, important, difference, but, it, may, not, have, been, a, representative, sample, of, bisexual, identified, men, they, concluded, that, bisexual, identified, men, with, bisexual, arousal, patterns, do, indeed, exist, but, could, not, establish, whether, such, a, pattern, is, typical, of, bisexual, identified, men, in, general, bisexual, erasure, or, bisexual, invisibility, is, the, tendency, to, ignore, remove, falsify, or, reexplain, evidence, of, bisexuality, in, culture, history, academia, news, media, and, other, primary, sources, in, its, most, extreme, form, bisexual, erasure, includes, denying, that, bisexuality, exists, it, is, often, a, manifestation, of, biphobia, although, it, does, not, necessarily, involve, overt, antagonism, there, is, increasing, inclusion, and, visibility, of, bisexuals, particularly, in, the, lgbt, community, american, psychologist, beth, firestone, writes, that, since, she, wrote, her, first, book, on, bisexuality, in, 1996, bisexuality, has, gained, visibility, although, progress, is, uneven, and, awareness, of, bisexuality, is, still, minimal, or, absent, in, many, of, the, more, remote, regions, of, our, country, and, internationally, a, common, symbol, of, the, bisexual, community, is, the, bisexual, flag, designed, by, michael, page, and, unveiled, in, 1998, which, has, a, deep, pink, stripe, at, the, top, for, homosexuality, a, blue, one, on, the, bottom, for, heterosexuality, and, a, purple, one, blending, the, pink, and, blue, in, the, middle, to, represent, bisexuality, another, symbol, with, a, similarly, symbolic, color, scheme, is, the, biangles, symbol, of, bisexuality, a, pair, of, overlapping, pink, and, blue, triangles, forming, lavender, where, they, intersect, this, design, is, an, expansion, on, the, pink, triangle, a, well, known, symbol, for, the, gay, community, the, biangles, symbol, was, designed, by, artist, liz, nania, as, she, co, organized, a, bisexual, contingent, for, the, second, national, march, on, washington, for, lesbian, and, gay, rights, in, 1987, however, some, bisexual, individuals, object, to, the, use, of, a, pink, triangle, as, it, was, a, symbol, that, adolf, hitler, s, regime, used, to, tag, and, persecute, homosexuals, in, response, a, double, crescent, moon, symbol, was, devised, by, vivian, wagner, in, 1998, this, symbol, is, common, in, germany, and, surrounding, countries, celebrate, bisexuality, day, also, called, bisexual, pride, day, bi, visibility, day, cbd, bisexual, pride, and, bi, visibility, day, and, bisexuality, day, is, observed, annually, on, september, 23, to, recognize, and, celebrate, bisexual, people, the, bisexual, community, and, the, history, of, bisexuality, in, steve, lenius, original, 2001, paper, he, explored, the, acceptance, of, bisexuality, in, a, supposedly, pansexual, bdsm, community, the, reasoning, behind, this, is, that, coming, out, had, become, primarily, the, territory, of, the, gay, and, lesbian, with, bisexuals, feeling, the, push, to, be, one, or, the, other, and, being, right, only, half, the, time, either, way, what, he, found, in, 2001, was, that, people, in, bdsm, were, open, to, discussion, about, the, topic, of, bisexuality, and, pansexuality, and, all, controversies, they, bring, to, the, table, but, personal, biases, and, issues, stood, in, the, way, of, actively, using, such, labels, a, decade, later, lenius, 2011, looked, back, on, his, study, and, considered, if, anything, has, changed, he, concluded, that, the, standing, of, bisexuals, in, the, bdsm, and, kink, community, was, unchanged, and, believed, that, positive, shifts, in, attitude, were, moderated, by, society, s, changing, views, towards, different, sexualities, and, orientations, but, lenius, 2011, does, emphasize, that, the, pansexual, promoting, bdsm, community, helped, advance, greater, acceptance, of, alternative, sexualities, brandy, lin, simula, 2012, on, the, other, hand, argues, that, bdsm, actively, resists, gender, conforming, and, identified, three, different, types, of, bdsm, bisexuality, gender, switching, gender, based, styles, taking, on, a, different, gendered, style, depending, on, gender, of, partner, when, playing, and, rejection, of, gender, resisting, the, idea, that, gender, matters, in, their, play, partners, simula, 2012, explains, that, practitioners, of, bdsm, routinely, challenge, our, concepts, of, sexuality, by, pushing, the, limits, on, pre, existing, ideas, of, sexual, orientation, and, gender, norms, for, some, bdsm, and, kink, provides, a, platform, in, creating, identities, that, are, fluid, ever, changing, feminist, positions, on, bisexuality, range, greatly, from, acceptance, of, bisexuality, as, a, feminist, issue, to, rejection, of, bisexuality, as, reactionary, and, anti, feminist, backlash, to, lesbian, feminism, a, number, of, women, who, were, at, one, time, involved, in, lesbian, feminist, activism, have, since, come, out, as, bisexual, after, realizing, their, attractions, to, men, a, widely, studied, example, of, lesbian, bisexual, conflict, in, feminism, was, the, northampton, pride, march, in, massachusetts, during, the, years, between, 1989, and, 1993, where, many, feminists, involved, debated, over, whether, bisexuals, should, be, included, and, whether, or, not, bisexuality, was, compatible, with, feminism, common, lesbian, feminist, critiques, leveled, at, bisexuality, were, that, bisexuality, was, anti, feminist, that, bisexuality, was, a, form, of, false, consciousness, and, that, bisexual, women, who, pursue, relationships, with, men, were, deluded, and, desperate, tensions, between, bisexual, feminists, and, lesbian, feminists, have, eased, since, the, 1990s, as, bisexual, women, have, become, more, accepted, in, the, feminist, community, but, some, lesbian, feminists, such, as, julie, bindel, are, still, critical, of, bisexuality, bindel, has, described, female, bisexuality, as, a, fashionable, trend, being, promoted, due, to, sexual, hedonism, and, broached, the, question, of, whether, bisexuality, even, exists, she, has, also, made, tongue, in, cheek, comparisons, of, bisexuals, to, cat, fanciers, and, devil, worshippers, sheila, jeffreys, writes, in, the, lesbian, heresy, that, while, many, feminists, are, comfortable, working, alongside, gay, men, they, are, uncomfortable, interacting, with, bisexual, men, jeffreys, states, that, while, gay, men, are, unlikely, to, sexually, harass, women, bisexual, men, are, just, as, likely, to, be, bothersome, to, women, as, heterosexual, men, donna, haraway, was, the, inspiration, and, genesis, for, cyberfeminism, with, her, 1985, essay, a, cyborg, manifesto, science, technology, and, socialist, feminism, in, the, late, twentieth, century, which, was, reprinted, in, simians, cyborgs, and, women, the, reinvention, of, nature, 1991, haraway, s, essay, states, that, the, cyborg, has, no, truck, with, bisexuality, pre, oedipal, symbiosis, unalienated, labor, or, other, seductions, to, organic,

maturity, the, relationship, was, supposed, to, become, non, sexual, but, it, is, not, clear, how, strictly, this, was, followed, there, was, some, stigma, attached, to, young, men, who, continued, their, relationships, with, their, mentors, into, adulthood, for, example, aristophanes, calls, them, eurypr, ktoi, meaning, wide, arses, and, depicts, them, like, women, similarly, in, ancient, rome,

among, men, nearly, half, 46, of, the, population, engages, in, both, heterosexual, and, homosexual, activities, or, reacts, to, persons, of, both, sexes, in, the, course, of, their, adult, lives, and, that, 37, of, the, total, male, population, has, at, least, some, overt, homosexual, experience, to, the, point, of, orgasm, since, the, onset, of, adolescence, kinsey, himself, disliked, the, use, of, the, term, bisexual, to, describe, individuals, who, engage, in, sexual, activity, with, both, males, and, females, preferring, to, use, bisexual, in, its, original, biological, sense, as, hermaphroditic, stating, until, it, is, demonstrated, taste, in, a, sexual, relation, is, dependent, upon, the, individual, containing, within, his, anatomy, both, male, and, female, structures, or, male, and, female, physiological, capacities, it, is, unfortunate, to, call, such, individuals, bisexual, although, more, recent, researchers, believe, that, kinsey, overestimated, the, rate, of,
