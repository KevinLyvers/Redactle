xiangqi, t, i, chinese, pinyin, xi, ngq, commonly, known, as, chinese, chess, or, elephant, chess, is, a, strategy, board, game, for, two, players, it, is, the, most, popular, board, game, in, china, xiangqi, is, in, the, same, family, of, games, as, shogi, janggi, western, chess, chaturanga, and, indian, chess, besides, china, and, areas, with, significant, ethnic, chinese, communities, this, game, is, also, a, popular, pastime, in, vietnam, where, it, is, known, as, c, t, ng, literally, general, s, chess, the, game, represents, a, battle, between, two, armies, with, the, primary, object, being, to, checkmate, the, enemy, s, general, king, distinctive, features, of, xiangqi, include, the, cannon, pao, which, must, jump, to, capture, a, rule, prohibiting, the, generals, from, facing, each, other, directly, areas, on, the, board, called, the, river, and, palace, which, restrict, the, movement, of, some, pieces, but, enhance, that, of, others, and, the, placement, of, the, pieces, on, the, intersections, of, the, board, lines, rather, than, within, the, squares, xiangqi, is, played, on, a, board, nine, lines, wide, and, ten, lines, long, as, in, the, game, go, or, w, i, q, the, pieces, are, placed, on, the, intersections, which, are, known, as, points, the, vertical, lines, are, known, as, files, chinese, pinyin, l, road, and, the, horizontal, lines, are, known, as, ranks, chinese, pinyin, xi, n, line, centred, at, the, first, to, third, and, eighth, to, tenth, ranks, of, the, board, are, two, zones, each, three, points, by, three, points, demarcated, by, two, diagonal, lines, connecting, opposite, corners, and, intersecting, at, the, centre, point, each, of, these, areas, is, known, as, g, ng, a, palace, dividing, the, two, opposing, sides, between, the, fifth, and, sixth, ranks, is, h, the, river, the, river, is, usually, marked, with, the, phrases, ch, h, meaning, river, of, the, chu, and, h, n, ji, meaning, border, of, the, han, a, reference, to, the, chu, han, war, although, the, river, or, hanchu, boundary, provides, a, visual, division, between, the, two, sides, only, two, pieces, are, affected, by, its, presence, soldiers, have, an, enhanced, move, after, crossing, the, river, and, elephants, cannot, cross, it, the, starting, points, of, the, soldiers, and, cannons, are, usually, but, not, always, marked, with, small, crosses, the, pieces, start, in, the, position, shown, in, the, diagram, above, which, player, moves, first, has, varied, throughout, history, and, from, one, part, of, china, to, another, different, xiangqi, books, advise, either, that, the, black, or, red, side, moves, first, some, books, refer, to, the, two, sides, as, north, and, south, which, direction, corresponds, to, which, colour, also, varies, from, source, to, source, generally, red, moves, first, in, most, modern, tournaments, each, player, in, turn, moves, one, piece, from, the, point, it, occupies, to, another, point, pieces, are, generally, not, permitted, to, move, through, points, occupied, by, other, pieces, the, exception, being, the, cannon, s, capturing, move, a, piece, can, be, moved, onto, a, point, occupied, by, an, enemy, piece, in, which, case, the, enemy, piece, is, captured, and, removed, from, the, board, a, player, cannot, capture, one, of, their, own, pieces, pieces, are, never, promoted, converted, into, other, pieces, although, the, soldier, gains, the, ability, to, move, sideways, after, it, crosses, the, river, almost, all, pieces, capture, using, their, normal, moves, while, the, cannon, has, a, special, capture, move, described, below, the, game, ends, when, one, player, checkmates, the, other, s, general, when, the, general, is, in, danger, of, being, captured, by, the, enemy, player, on, their, next, move, the, enemy, player, has, delivered, a, check, abbreviated, as, ji, ng, and, the, general, is, in, check, a, check, should, be, announced, if, the, general, s, player, can, make, no, move, to, prevent, the, general, s, capture, the, situation, is, called, checkmate, unlike, in, chess, in, which, stalemate, is, a, draw, in, xiangqi, it, is, a, loss, for, the, stalemated, player, in, xiangqi, a, player, often, with, a, material, or, positional, disadvantage, may, attempt, to, check, or, chase, pieces, in, a, way, such, that, the, moves, fall, in, a, cycle, preventing, the, opponent, from, winning, while, this, is, accepted, in, western, chess, in, xiangqi, the, following, special, rules, are, used, to, make, it, harder, to, draw, the, game, by, endless, checking, or, chasing, regardless, of, whether, the, positions, of, the, pieces, are, repeated, or, not, different, sets, of, rules, set, different, limits, on, what, is, considered, perpetual, for, example, club, xiangqi, rules, allow, a, player, to, check, or, chase, six, consecutive, times, using, one, piece, twelve, times, using, two, pieces, and, eighteen, times, using, three, pieces, before, considering, the, action, perpetual, the, above, rules, to, prevent, perpetual, checking, and, chasing, while, popular, are, not, the, only, ones, there, are, numerous, end, game, situations, each, player, controls, an, army, of, 16, pieces, the, armies, are, usually, coloured, red, and, black, pieces, are, flat, circular, disks, labelled, or, engraved, with, a, chinese, character, identifying, the, piece, type, and, in, a, colour, indicating, which, player, has, ownership, the, black, pieces, are, marked, with, somewhat, different, characters, from, the, corresponding, red, pieces, on, mainland, china, most, sets, still, use, traditional, chinese, characters, as, opposed, to, simplified, chinese, characters, modern, pieces, are, usually, plastic, though, some, sets, are, wooden, and, more, expensive, sets, may, use, jade, in, more, ancient, times, many, sets, were, simple, unpainted, woodcarvings, thus, to, distinguish, between, pieces, of, the, two, sides, most, corresponding, pieces, used, characters, that, were, similar, but, varied, slightly, this, practice, may, have, originated, in, situations, where, there, was, only, one, material, available, to, make, the, pieces, from, and, no, colouring, material, available, to, distinguish, the, opposing, armies, the, oldest, xiangqi, piece, found, to, date, is, a, chariot, piece, it, is, kept, in, the, three, gorges, museum, generals, or, kings, are, labelled, trad, simp, ji, ng, general, on, the, black, side, and, trad, simp, shu, i, marshal, on, the, red, side, the, general, starts, the, game, at, the, midpoint, of, the, back, edge, within, the, palace, the, general, may, move, and, capture, one, point, orthogonally, and, may, not, leave, the, palace, with, the, following, exception, if, the, two, generals, face, each, other, along, the, same, file, with, no, intervening, pieces, the, flying, general, move, may, be, executed, in, which, the, general, to, move, crosses, the, board, to, capture, the, enemy, general, in, practice, this, rule, means, that, creating, this, situation, in, the, first, place, means, moving, into, check, and, is, therefore, not, allowed, the, indian, name, king, for, this, piece, was, changed, to, general, because, of, chinese, naming, taboos, china, s, rulers, objected, to, their, royal, titles, being, given, to, game, pieces, despite, this, the, general, is, sometimes, called, the, king, by, english, speaking, players, due, to, their, similar, functions, as, royal, pieces, advisors, also, known, as, guards, and, less, commonly, as, assistants, mandarins, ministers, or, warriors, are, labelled, sh, scholar, gentleman, officer, guardian, for, black, and, sh, scholar, official, guardian, for, red, rarely, sets, use, the, character, for, both, colours, the, advisors, start, on, either, side, of, the, general, they, move, and, capture, one, point, diagonally, and, may, not, leave, the, palace, which, confines, them, to, five, points, on, the, board, the, advisor, is, probably, derived, from, the, mantri, in, chaturanga, like, the, queen, in, western, chess, there, is, some, controversy, about, whether, really, is, intended, to, mean, scholar, gentleman, which, would, be, or, guard, guardian, which, would, be, simplified, chinese, one, argument, for, the, latter, is, that, their, functionality, seems, to, be, to, guard, protect, the, general, the, common, western, translation, advisor, does, not, reflect, this, layer, of, meaning, elephants, or, bishops, are, labeled, xi, ng, elephant, for, black, and, xi, ng, minister, for, red, they, are, located, next, to, the, advisors, these, pieces, move, and, capture, exactly, two, points, diagonally, and, may, not, jump, over, intervening, pieces, the, move, is, described, as, being, like, the, character, ti, n, field, in, reference, to, the, board, s, squares, if, an, elephant, cannot, move, due, to, a, diagonally, adjacent, piece, it, is, known, as, blocking, the, elephant, s, eye, elephants, may, not, cross, the, river, to, attack, the, enemy, general, and, serve, as, defensive, pieces, because, an, elephant, s, movement, is, restricted, to, just, seven, board, positions, it, can, be, easily, trapped, or, threatened, the, two, elephants, are, often, used, to, defend, each, other, the, chinese, characters, for, minister, and, elephant, are, homophones, in, mandarin, listen, and, both, have, alternative, meanings, as, appearance, or, image, however, in, english, both, are, referred, to, as, elephants, and, less, commonly, as, bishops, due, to, their, similar, movements, horses, or, knights, are, labelled, m, for, black, and, m, for, red, in, sets, marked, with, traditional, chinese, characters, and, m, for, both, black, and, red, in, sets, marked, with, simplified, chinese, characters, some, sets, use, for, both, colours, horses, begin, the, game, next, to, the, elephants, on, their, outside, flanks, a, horse, moves, and, captures, one, point, orthogonally, and, then, one, point, diagonally, away, from, its, former, position, a, move, which, is, traditionally, described, as, being, like, the, character, r, the, horse, does, not, jump, as, the, knight, does, in, western, chess, and, can, be, blocked, by, a, piece, of, either, colour, located, one, point, horizontally, or, vertically, adjacent, to, it, blocking, a, horse, is, called, hobbling, the, horse, s, leg, the, diagram, on, the, right, illustrates, the, horse, s, movement, since, horses, can, be, blocked, it, is, possible, for, one, player, s, horse, to, have, an, asymmetric, attack, advantage, if, an, opponent, s, horse, is, blocked, as, seen, in, the, diagram, on, the, right, the, horse, is, sometimes, called, the, knight, by, english, speaking, players, due, to, their, similar, movements, chariots, or, rooks, or, cars, are, labelled, j, for, black, and, j, for, red, in, sets, marked, with, traditional, chinese, characters, and, for, both, black, and, red, in, sets, marked, with, simplified, chinese, characters, some, traditional, sets, use, for, both, colours, in, the, context, of, xiangqi, all, of, these, characters, are, pronounced, as, j, instead, of, the, common, pronunciation, ch, the, chariot, moves, and, captures, any, distance, orthogonally, but, may, not, jump, over, intervening, pieces, the, chariots, begin, the, game, on, the, points, at, the, corners, of, the, board, the, chariot, is, often, considered, to, be, the, strongest, piece, in, the, game, due, to, its, freedom, of, movement, and, lack, of, restrictions, the, chariot, is, sometimes, called, the, rook, by, english, speaking, players, since, it, moves, identically, to, the, rook, in, western, chess, chinese, players, and, others, often, call, this, piece, a, car, since, that, is, one, modern, meaning, of, the, character, cannons, are, labelled, p, o, catapult, for, black, and, p, o, cannon, for, red, the, names, are, homophones, though, sometimes, is, used, for, both, red, and, black, the, sh, radical, of, means, stone, and, the, hu, radical, of, means, fire, both, colours, pieces, are, normally, referred, to, as, cannons, in, english, the, black, piece, is, sometimes, labelled, b, o, each, player, has, two, cannons, which, start, on, the, row, behind, the, soldiers, two, points, in, front, of, the, horses, cannons, move, like, chariots, any, distance, orthogonally, without, jumping, but, can, only, capture, by, jumping, a, single, piece, of, either, colour, along, the, path, of, attack, the, piece, over, which, the, cannon, jumps, is, called, the, trad, simp, p, o, t, i, cannon, platform, or, screen, any, number, of, unoccupied, spaces, including, none, may, exist, between, the, cannon, screen, and, the, piece, to, be, captured, cannons, can, be, exchanged, for, horses, immediately, from, their, starting, positions, soldiers, or, pawns, are, labelled, z, pawn, or, private, for, black, and, b, ng, soldier, for, red, each, side, starts, with, five, soldiers, soldiers, begin, the, game, located, on, every, other, point, one, row, back, from, the, edge, of, the, river, they, move, and, capture, by, advancing, one, point, once, they, have, crossed, the, river, they, may, also, move, and, capture, one, point, horizontally, soldiers, cannot, move, backward, and, therefore, cannot, retreat, after, advancing, to, the, last, rank, of, the, board, however, a, soldier, may, still, move, sideways, at, the, enemy, s, edge, the, soldier, is, sometimes, called, the, pawn, by, english, speaking, players, due, to, the, pieces, similar, movements, these, approximate, values, do, not, take, into, account, the, position, of, the, piece, in, question, except, the, soldier, in, a, general, sense, the, positions, of, other, pieces, on, the, board, or, the, number, of, pieces, remaining, in, what, follows, minor, piece, will, refer, to, horses, and, cannons, and, defensive, piece, unless, otherwise, specified, will, refer, to, the, non, royal, pieces, that, cannot, cross, the, river, namely, advisors, and, elephants, other, common, rules, of, assessment, there, are, several, types, of, notation, used, to, record, xiangqi, games, in, each, case, the, moves, are, numbered, and, written, with, the, same, general, pattern, it, is, clearer, but, not, required, to, write, each, move, pair, on, a, separate, line, the, book, the, chess, of, china, describes, a, move, notation, method, in, which, the, ranks, of, the, board, are, numbered, 1, to, 10, from, closest, to, farthest, away, followed, by, a, digit, 1, to, 9, for, files, from, right, to, left, both, values, are, relative, to, the, moving, player, moves, are, then, indicated, as, follows, thus, the, most, common, opening, in, the, game, would, be, written, as, a, notation, system, partially, described, in, a, manual, of, chinese, chess, and, used, by, several, computer, software, implementations, describes, moves, in, relative, terms, as, follows, the, file, numbers, are, counted, from, each, player, s, right, to, each, player, s, left, in, case, there, are, two, identical, pieces, in, one, file, symbols, front, and, rear, are, used, instead, of, former, file, number, direction, of, movement, is, indicated, via, an, operator, symbol, a, plus, sign, is, used, to, indicate, forward, movement, a, minus, sign, is, used, to, indicate, backward, movement, a, dot, or, period, or, equals, sign, is, used, to, indicate, horizontal, or, lateral, movement, for, a, piece, that, moves, diagonally, such, as, the, horse, or, elephant, the, plus, or, minus, sign, is, used, rather, than, the, period, thus, the, most, common, opening, in, the, game, would, be, written, as, according, to, world, xiangqi, federation, wxf, in, the, case, of, tripled, quadrupled, or, quintupled, soldiers, pawns, there, is, no, need, to, specify, the, p, for, pawn, instead, the, soldiers, are, numbered, starting, from, the, frontmost, soldier, and, this, number, replaces, the, usual, piece, abbreviation, the, file, number, is, given, immediately, after, as, usual, thus, the, notation, to, move, the, middle, of, a, set, of, tripled, soldiers, on, the, 5th, file, to, the, 4th, file, would, be, in, older, books, written, in, chinese, the, system, is, the, same, except, that, the, names, of, the, pieces, are, written, in, chinese, the, name, for, the, cannon, on, both, sides, is, the, name, for, the, horse, on, both, sides, is, forward, motion, is, indicated, with, pronounced, j, n, backward, motion, is, indicated, with, tu, sideways, motion, is, indicated, with, p, ng, and, numbers, are, written, in, chinese, either, for, both, players, or, for, just, black, thus, the, most, common, opening, in, the, game, might, be, written, as, this, system, is, unofficial, and, principally, used, by, western, players, it, is, similar, to, algebraic, notation, for, western, chess, letters, are, used, for, files, and, numbers, for, ranks, file, a, is, on, red, s, left, and, rank, 1, is, nearest, to, red, a, point, s, designation, does, not, depend, on, which, player, moves, for, both, sides, a1, is, the, lowest, left, point, from, red, s, side, pieces, are, abbreviated, as, in, notation, system, 2, except, that, no, letter, is, used, for, the, soldier, former, position, is, only, indicated, if, necessary, to, distinguish, between, two, identical, pieces, that, could, have, made, the, move, if, they, share, the, same, file, indicate, which, rank, moves, if, they, share, the, same, rank, indicate, which, file, moves, if, they, share, neither, rank, nor, file, then, the, file, is, indicated, capture, is, indicated, by, x, no, symbol, is, used, to, indicate, a, non, capturing, move, check, is, indicated, by, double, check, by, triple, check, by, and, quadruple, check, by, checkmate, is, indicated, by, for, analysis, purposes, bad, moves, are, indicated, by, and, good, moves, by, these, can, be, combined, if, the, analysis, is, uncertain, might, be, either, but, is, probably, good, is, probably, bad, or, repeated, for, emphasis, is, a, disaster, thus, the, most, common, opening, in, the, game, would, be, written, as, for, example, the, following, game, is, tied, with, several, others, as, the, shortest, possible, xiangqi, game, because, of, the, size, of, the, board, and, the, low, number, of, long, range, pieces, there, is, a, tendency, for, the, battle, to, focus, on, a, particular, area, of, the, board, xiangqi, involves, several, tactics, common, to, games, in, the, chess, family, some, common, ones, are, briefly, discussed, here, in, contrast, to, the, ubiquity, of, pawn, chains, in, western, chess, soldiers, typically, do, not, support, each, other, until, the, endgame, because, from, the, initial, position, it, takes, a, minimum, of, five, moves, of, a, soldier, to, allow, mutual, protection, between, two, of, them, and, they, are, often, prone, to, capture, by, other, pieces, soldiers, horses, cannons, and, chariots, can, form, up, formations, that, protect, each, other, however, lining, up, chariots, must, be, done, with, caution, as, this, risks, losing, one, chariot, to, an, enemy, s, inferior, piece, horses, that, support, each, other, are, called, linked, horses, chinese, which, is, a, relatively, safe, formation, of, the, horses, though, it, can, still, be, threatened, with, a, soldier, a, chariot, plus, another, minor, piece, or, a, piece, blocking, one, of, the, horses, thus, making, the, protection, one, sided, it, is, common, to, use, cannons, independently, to, control, particular, ranks, and, files, using, a, cannon, to, control, the, middle, file, is, often, considered, vital, strategy, because, it, pins, pieces, such, as, the, advisors, and, elephants, to, the, general, which, in, turn, restrict, their, general, s, movement, the, two, files, adjacent, to, the, middle, file, are, also, considered, important, and, horses, and, chariots, can, be, used, to, push, for, checkmate, there, since, the, general, is, usually, safest, in, its, original, position, before, the, endgame, phase, attacking, the, general, commonly, involves, forcing, the, general, out, of, its, original, position, with, check, or, with, threats, thus, specific, points, and, formations, are, very, important, in, xiangqi, for, an, attacking, red, horse, the, most, fatal, points, are, c9, and, g9, chinese, especially, since, without, proper, defence, a, quick, mate, can, follow, with, an, extra, chariot, or, cannon, for, a, cannon, one, of, the, most, fatal, formations, is, the, exposed, cannon, chinese, where, the, cannon, directly, controls, the, middle, file, with, no, other, pieces, between, the, cannon, and, the, general, this, formation, is, particularly, dangerous, since, the, defensive, side, cannot, move, any, piece, in, front, of, the, cannon, while, with, an, extra, cannon, joining, the, attack, mate, can, follow, on, the, spot, and, with, an, extra, rook, the, offensive, side, can, mount, a, double, check, with, the, rook, in, front, of, the, cannon, followed, by, a, windmill, as, when, the, check, is, blocked, the, rook, moving, laterally, discovers, a, new, check, from, the, cannon, often, winning, at, least, a, piece, afterwards, if, the, defensive, side, cannot, chase, the, cannon, away, or, capture, it, it, must, move, the, general, forward, to, avoid, these, threats, leaving, the, general, vulnerable, to, attacks, another, fatal, formation, called, the, cannon, controlled, centroid, horse, chinese, diagram, at, right, also, requires, particularly, bad, coordination, of, the, enemy, pieces, in, the, diagram, black, s, centroid, horse, occupies, the, centre, of, the, palace, blocking, black, s, own, general, and, advisors, and, being, pinned, to, the, general, by, the, red, cannon, cannot, move, black, s, cannon, at, e8, is, also, pinned, to, its, own, general, it, too, is, unable, to, move, and, restricts, the, movement, of, black, s, two, elephants, making, them, unable, to, protect, each, other, such, a, formation, in, the, middlegame, often, produces, deadly, threats, of, smothered, mates, while, in, the, endgame, as, in, the, diagram, red, s, cannon, cannot, be, chased, away, rendering, black, s, general, advisors, cannon, on, e8, and, horse, all, permanently, immobilized, even, though, black, is, up, a, minor, piece, red, has, a, clear, win, the, game, concluded, 41, hg7, forking, the, elephant, and, pinned, cannon, and, creating, a, mating, threat, eg10, 42, hh9, ci9, 43, hf8, cf9, if, not, for, the, other, black, cannon, it, is, instant, mate, 44, hxg6, and, black, resigned, black, s, only, active, piece, the, cannon, on, f9, is, absolutely, helpless, to, stop, red, s, horse, and, soldiers, which, will, soon, invade, the, palace, a, common, defensive, configuration, is, to, leave, the, general, at, its, starting, position, deploy, one, advisor, and, one, elephant, on, the, two, points, directly, in, front, of, the, general, and, to, leave, the, other, advisor, and, elephant, in, their, starting, positions, to, the, side, of, the, general, in, this, setup, the, advisor, and, elephant, pairs, support, each, other, and, the, general, is, immune, from, attacks, by, cannons, losing, any, defensive, pieces, makes, the, general, vulnerable, to, cannon, attack, and, the, setup, may, need, to, be, abandoned, the, defender, may, move, defensive, pieces, away, from, the, general, or, even, sacrifice, them, intentionally, to, ward, off, attack, by, a, cannon, solution, 1, rh10, 1, af10, 2, rh9, afe9, 3, rg10, af10, 4, rg9, afe9, 5, rh10, 5, af10, 6, re9, 6, adxe9, 7, rh9, eeg10, 8, rxe9, the, chariot, is, untouchable, with, legal, moves, gd10, 9, re10, gd9, 10, d8, gxd8, 11, rd10, long, sequences, of, checks, leading, to, mate, or, gain, of, material, are, common, both, in, chess, compositions, and, in, actual, play, a, skilled, xiangqi, player, would, often, have, to, calculate, several, steps, or, even, tens, of, steps, ahead, for, a, forced, sequence, in, the, diagram, on, the, right, black, has, an, immediate, mating, threat, which, cannot, be, parried, forcing, red, to, check, black, on, every, move, although, it, requires, 11, moves, to, mate, its, general, idea, is, clear, induce, a, smothered, check, by, sacrificing, a, chariot, at, the, centre, of, the, palace, e9, then, force, black, to, open, the, centre, file, enabling, the, red, general, to, assist, the, attack, and, finally, mate, by, facing, generals, since, the, left, and, right, flanks, of, the, starting, setup, are, symmetrical, it, is, customary, to, make, the, first, move, on, the, right, flank, starting, on, the, left, flank, is, considered, needlessly, confusing, the, most, common, opening, is, to, move, the, cannon, to, the, central, column, an, opening, known, as, trad, simp, d, ng, t, u, p, o, or, central, cannon, the, most, common, reply, is, to, advance, the, horse, on, the, same, flank, together, this, move, and, response, is, known, by, the, rhyme, trad, simp, d, ng, t, u, p, o, m, l, i, ti, o, the, notation, for, this, is,

the, trad, simp, or, screen, horses, defence, in, which, black, develops, the, other, horse, to, further, protect, their, middle, pawn, h2, 3, or, hc8, either, immediately, on, their, second, move, or, later, when, black, transposes, the, game, into, this, opening, alternative, common, first, moves, by, black, are, developing, either, cannons, 1, c8, 5, 1, che8, or, 1, c2, 5, 1, cbe8, note, that, after, either, of, these, moves, taking, the, central, soldier, with, the, cannon, 2, c5, 4, or, 2, cxe7, is, a, beginner, s, trap, that, impedes, development, and, coordination, of, red, s, pieces, if, black, plays, correctly, for, example, 1, che3, che8, 2, cxe7, ade9, 3, hg3, hg8, 4, ce5, rh10, when, black, develops, the, rook, first, and, the, loss, of, black, s, middle, pawn, actually, enabled, black, s, horses, to, occupy, the, centre, on, the, next, moves, other, common, first, moves, by, red, include, moving, an, elephant, to, the, central, column, 1, ege3, advancing, the, soldier, on, the, third, or, seventh, file, 1, c5, moving, a, horse, forward, 1, hg3, and, moving, either, cannon, to, the, 4th, or, 6th, d, or, f, file, 1, chd3, or, 1, chf3, compared, to, the, central, cannon, openings, these, openings, are, generally, less, restricted, by, theory, general, advice, for, the, opening, includes, rapid, development, of, at, least, one, chariot, and, putting, it, on, open, files, and, ranks, as, it, is, the, most, powerful, piece, with, a, long, attack, range, there, is, a, saying, that, only, a, poor, player, does, not, move, a, chariot, in, the, first, three, moves, chinese, however, this, is, not, to, be, taken, literally, and, is, in, fact, often, violated, in, modern, xiangqi, games, attacking, and, defending, the, centre, especially, the, central, soldiers, central, pawns, are, common, themes, in, the, opening, hence, the, central, cannon, openings, usually, at, least, one, horse, should, be, moved, to, the, middle, in, order, to, defend, the, central, soldier, however, undefended, central, soldiers, can, also, become, poisoned, pawns, in, the, early, moves, especially, if, the, attacking, side, does, not, have, an, immediate, follow, up, to, retain, the, pressure, on, the, central, file, xiangqi, strategy, shares, common, themes, with, chess, but, has, some, differences, like, in, chess, xiangqi, piece, values, depend, highly, on, the, position, on, the, board, the, following, study, from, volume, 42, of, the, elegant, pastime, manual, dating, from, the, ming, dynasty, illustrates, this, dramatically, it, is, red, to, play, and, win, in, this, position, red, is, up, two, soldiers, and, a, cannon, but, black, threatens, seemingly, unstoppable, mate, with, rf1, since, 1, ec5, ad8, renews, the, mate, threat, note, that, the, red, chariot, is, nearly, useless, having, only, two, legal, moves, in, stark, contrast, to, the, very, active, black, chariot, however, red, averts, the, checkmate, by, sacrificing, both, the, cannon, and, chariot, 1, ca10, hxa10, 2, ea3, rxa1, or, the, chariot, is, lost, since, the, general, protects, the, elephant, on, e3, which, in, turn, guards, g1, and, the, red, horse, guards, e2, 3, eec1, despite, the, substantial, sacrifice, of, material, by, red, black, s, chariot, has, now, become, useless, as, it, is, permanently, immobilized, by, the, red, elephants, and, horse, the, red, general, prevents, the, black, soldier, on, g2, from, moving, laterally, to, free, the, chariot, for, example, 3, g1, 4, gf2, black, s, horse, similarly, has, no, safe, move, due, to, the, red, soldier, on, c8, which, also, along, with, the, soldier, on, f9, prevents, the, black, general, from, attacking, the, soldier, on, f9, from, the, behind, in, addition, the, black, soldier, on, g6, is, undefended, and, has, no, safe, move, so, red, can, win, it, by, pushing, the, soldier, on, c4, to, c6, and, moving, it, laterally, to, the, g, file, after, which, the, position, is, effectively, an, endgame, of, three, soldiers, against, two, advisers, an, easy, win, for, red, see, below, despite, being, down, a, chariot, for, three, soldiers, though, xiangqi, endgames, require, remarkable, skill, to, be, played, well, there, are, a, number, of, widely, known, book, wins, and, book, draws, without, a, counterpart, to, pawn, promotion, xiangqi, endgames, instead, focus, more, directly, on, forcing, checkmate, or, stalemate, and, in, this, regard, resemble, pawnless, chess, endgames, since, stalemate, is, a, loss, for, the, stalemated, player, instead, of, a, draw, most, book, draws, in, xiangqi, are, due, to, fortresses, with, a, few, draws, due, to, insufficient, material, a, general, rule, in, xiangqi, endgames, for, the, advantageous, side, is, that, when, there, s, less, material, on, the, board, do, not, trade, pieces, easily, as, with, fewer, attacking, pieces, on, the, board, defending, is, easier, in, contrast, to, western, chess, where, it, is, almost, always, advantageous, to, trade, pieces, when, up, on, material, hence, if, a, certain, type, of, endgame, can, transpose, by, trading, pieces, into, another, type, of, endgame, which, is, a, book, win, then, this, endgame, itself, is, a, book, win, red, wins, with, either, side, to, move, inducing, zugzwang, is, a, crucial, theme, in, winning, simple, endgames, and, almost, exclusively, in, simple, endgames, in, the, general, soldier, vs, general, endgame, shown, on, the, right, red, s, first, main, goal, is, to, occupy, the, middle, file, red, wins, with, 1, gd1, a, waiting, move, and, black, is, in, zugzwang, black, must, proceed, with, 1, ge8, as, 1, ge10, instantly, loses, after, 2, f9, after, 1, ge8, 2, f9, gf8, 3, e9, ge8, 4, d9, gf8, 5, ge1, red, s, general, successfully, occupies, the, middle, file, the, game, would, conclude, with, 5, gf9, 6, e9, and, regardless, of, black, s, reply, 7, ge2, stale, mates, black, reciprocal, zugzwang, whoever, moves, first, loses, reciprocal, zugzwang, is, possible, but, very, rare, and, usually, seen, in, endgame, compositions, in, this, endgame, shown, on, the, right, whoever, moves, loses, since, when, either, of, the, two, generals, moves, to, an, open, d, or, f, file, it, threatens, unstoppable, mate, while, the, player, to, move, only, helps, the, enemy, general, occupy, one, of, the, files, for, instance, red, can, only, move, their, two, soldiers, if, he, is, to, move, moving, the, f, or, d, soldier, allows, the, enemy, general, to, occupy, the, f, file, d, file, even, if, 1, fe9, gf10, 2, d10, when, red, threatens, mate, in, 1, black, still, mates, immediately, with, either, 2, fe2, or, 2, f1, red, to, play, wins, black, to, play, draws, this, type, of, endgame, is, considered, one, of, the, more, complex, endgames, commonly, known, book, wins, and, book, draws, are, single, chariot, endgames, chariot, soldiers, unadvanced, chariot, horse, chariot, cannon, two, chariots, a, game, called, xiangqi, was, mentioned, as, dating, to, the, warring, states, period, according, to, the, first, century, bc, text, shuo, yuan, it, was, one, of, lord, mengchang, of, qi, s, interests, however, the, rules, of, that, game, are, not, described, and, it, was, not, necessarily, related, to, the, present, day, game, emperor, wu, of, northern, zhou, wrote, a, book, in, ad, 569, called, xiang, jing, it, described, the, rules, of, an, astronomically, themed, game, called, xiangxi, the, word, xi, ngq, is, usually, translated, as, elephant, game, or, figure, game, because, the, chinese, character, means, elephant, and, figure, it, originated, as, a, stylized, drawing, of, an, elephant, and, was, used, to, write, a, word, meaning, figure, likely, because, the, two, words, were, pronounced, the, same, for, these, reasons, murray, theorized, that, in, china, took, over, the, board, and, name, of, a, game, called, in, the, sense, of, astronomical, game, which, represented, the, apparent, movements, of, naked, eye, visible, astronomical, objects, in, the, night, sky, and, that, the, earliest, chinese, references, to, meant, the, astronomical, game, and, not, chinese, chess, previous, games, called, xi, ngq, may, have, been, based, on, the, movements, of, sky, objects, however, the, connection, between, and, astronomy, is, marginal, and, arose, from, constellations, being, called, figures, in, astronomical, contexts, where, other, meanings, of, figure, were, less, likely, this, usage, may, have, led, some, ancient, chinese, authors, to, theorize, that, the, game, started, as, a, simulation, of, astronomy, to, support, his, argument, murray, quoted, an, old, chinese, source, that, says, that, in, the, older, xiangqi, which, modern, xiangqi, may, have, taken, some, of, its, rules, from, the, game, pieces, could, be, shuffled, which, does, not, happen, in, the, modern, chess, style, xiangqi, murray, also, wrote, that, in, ancient, china, there, was, more, than, one, game, called, xiangqi, murray, also, even, supposed, that, chaturanga, from, india, influenced, the, formation, of, present, day, xiangqi, an, alternative, hypothesis, to, murray, s, is, that, xiangqi, was, patterned, after, the, array, of, troops, in, the, warring, states, period, david, h, li, for, example, argues, that, the, game, was, developed, by, han, xin, in, the, winter, of, 204, bc, 203, bc, to, prepare, for, an, upcoming, battle, his, theories, have, been, questioned, by, other, chess, researchers, however, the, earliest, description, of, the, game, s, rules, appears, in, the, story, c, n, sh, n, in, the, collection, xuanguai, lu, written, by, niu, sengru, in, the, middle, part, of, the, tang, dynasty, xiangqi, is, the, same, as, it, is, today, from, southern, song, dynasty, janggi, of, korean, peninsula, originates, from, xiangqi, with, the, popularization, of, xiangqi, many, different, schools, of, circles, and, players, came, into, prominence, many, books, and, manuals, on, the, techniques, of, playing, the, game, were, also, published, they, played, an, important, role, in, popularizing, xiangqi, and, improving, the, techniques, of, play, in, modern, times, with, the, economic, and, cultural, development, during, the, qing, dynasty, xiangqi, entered, a, new, stage, a, western, style, encyclopedia, of, chinese, chess, openings, was, written, in, 2004, although, xiangqi, has, its, origin, in, asia, there, are, xiangqi, leagues, and, clubs, all, over, the, world, each, european, nation, generally, has, its, own, governing, league, for, example, in, britain, xiangqi, is, regulated, by, the, united, kingdom, chinese, chess, association, asian, countries, also, have, nationwide, leagues, such, as, the, malaysia, chinese, chess, association, in, addition, there, are, several, international, federations, and, tournaments, the, chinese, xiangqi, association, hosts, several, tournaments, every, year, including, the, yin, li, and, ram, cup, tournaments, other, organizations, include, the, asian, xiangqi, federation, and, a, world, xiangqi, federation, which, hosts, tournaments, and, competitions, bi, annually, with, most, limited, to, players, from, member, nations, there, are, europeanized, versions, of, boards, 10, 9, and, figures, of, xiangqi, the, asian, xiangqi, federation, axf, and, its, corresponding, member, associations, rank, players, in, a, format, similar, to, the, elo, rating, system, of, chess, according, to, the, xiangqi, database, the, top, ranking, female, and, male, players, in, china, as, of, june, 2012, were, tang, dan, and, jiang, chuan, with, ratings, of, 2529, and, 2667, respectively, other, strong, players, include, zhao, guanfang, female, xu, yinchuan, male, lu, qin, male, and, wang, linna, female, the, asian, xiangqi, federation, also, bestows, the, title, of, grandmaster, to, select, individuals, around, the, world, who, have, excelled, at, xiangqi, or, made, special, contributions, to, the, game, there, are, no, specific, criteria, for, becoming, a, grandmaster, and, there, are, only, approximately, 100, grandmasters, as, of, 2020, the, titles, of, grandmaster, is, bestowed, by, bodies, such, as, the, axf, and, the, chinese, xiangqi, association, cxa, the, game, tree, complexity, of, xiangqi, is, approximately, 10, 150, in, 2004, it, was, projected, that, a, human, top, player, would, be, defeated, before, 2010, xiangqi, is, one, of, the, more, popular, computer, versus, computer, competitions, at, the, computer, olympiads, computer, programs, for, playing, xiangqi, show, the, same, development, trend, as, has, occurred, for, international, chess, they, are, usually, console, applications, called, engines, which, communicate, their, moves, in, text, form, through, some, standard, protocol, for, displaying, the, board, graphically, they, then, rely, on, a, separate, graphical, user, interface, gui, through, such, standardization, many, different, engines, can, be, used, through, the, same, gui, which, can, also, be, used, for, automated, play, of, different, engines, against, each, other, popular, protocols, are, uci, universal, chess, interface, ucci, universal, chinese, chess, interface, qianhong, qh, protocol, and, winboard, xboard, wb, protocol, the, latter, two, named, after, the, guis, that, implemented, them, there, now, exist, many, dozens, of, xiangqi, engines, supporting, one, or, more, of, these, protocols, including, some, commercial, engines, blitz, chess, each, player, only, has, around, 5, 10, minutes, each, manchu, chess, invented, during, the, manchu, led, qing, dynasty, red, horses, cannons, and, one, of, the, chariots, are, absent, but, the, remaining, chariot, can, be, played, as, horses, and, cannons, as, well, supply, chess, similar, to, the, western, chess, variant, bughouse, chess, this, variant, features, the, ability, to, re, deploy, captured, pieces, similar, to, a, rule, in, shogi, four, players, play, as,

for, use, in, the, other, game, these, pieces, can, be, deployed, by, the, teammate, to, give, him, an, advantage, over, the, other, player, so, long, as, the, piece, starts, on, the, player, s, own, side, of, the, board, and, does, not, cause, the, opponent, to, be, in, check, formation, similar, to, fischer, random, chess, one, player, s, pieces, are, placed, randomly, on, one, side, of, the,
