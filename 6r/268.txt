fashion, cosmetics, hair, styling, and, even, cosmetic, surgery, they, say, that, this, pursuit, of, physical, beauty, even, encourages, some, women, to, diet, to, the, point, of, harming, themselves, the, london, feminist, network, argues, that, rather, than, being, empowering, beauty, pageants, do, the, opposite, denying, women, s, full, humanity, by, subjecting, them, to, objectification,

australia, targeted, beauty, pageants, in, order, to, in, the, words, of, activist, leslie, hall, challenge, the, notion, of, beauty, and, reject, the, charity, ethic, high, profile, demonstrations, led, to, some, charities, abandoning, their, use, of, such, contests, for, fundraising, and, also, saw, some, remove, offensive, language, from, their, organisational, titles, another, criticism, is, in, the, way, beauty, pageant, is, quantifiably, scored, as, highlighted, by, the, myth, of, the, perfect, 10, beauty, becomes, a, numerical, coefficient, in, ranking, contestants, and, this, type, of, scoring, still, remains, followed, as, a, system, even, in, nationwide, beauty, pageants, such, as, miss, america, researchers, suggest, that, these, events, strengthen, skills, such, as, interpersonal, communications, self, assurance, and, public, speaking, which, prove, to, be, useful, in, future, career, paths, the, requirement, for, contestants, to, wear, a, swimsuit, was, a, controversial, aspect, of, the, various, competitions, the, controversy, was, heightened, with, the, increasing, popularity, of, the, bikini, after, its, introduction, in, 1946, the, bikini, was, banned, for, the, miss, america, contest, in, 1947, because, of, roman, catholic, protesters, when, the, miss, world, contest, started, in, 1951, there, was, an, outcry, when, the, winner, was, crowned, in, a, bikini, pope, pius, xii, condemned, the, crowning, as, sinful, and, countries, with, religious, traditions, threatened, to, withdraw, delegates, the, bikini, was, banned, for, future, and, other, contests, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1990s, that, they, became, permitted, again, but, still, generated, controversy, when, finals, were, held, in, countries, where, bikinis, or,
