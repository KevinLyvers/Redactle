whisky, or, whiskey, is, a, type, of, liquor, made, from, fermented, grain, mash, various, grains, which, may, be, malted, are, used, for, different, varieties, including, barley, corn, rye, and, wheat, whisky, is, typically, aged, in, wooden, casks, which, are, typically, made, of, charred, white, oak, uncharred, white, oak, casks, previously, used, for, the, aging, of, port, rum, or, sherry, are, also, sometimes, used, whisky, is, a, strictly, regulated, spirit, worldwide, with, many, classes, and, types, the, typical, unifying, characteristics, of, the, different, classes, and, types, are, the, fermentation, of, grains, distillation, and, aging, in, wooden, barrels, the, word, whisky, or, whiskey, is, an, anglicisation, of, the, classical, gaelic, word, uisce, or, uisge, meaning, water, now, written, as, uisce, in, modern, irish, and, uisge, in, scottish, gaelic, this, gaelic, word, shares, its, ultimate, origins, with, germanic, water, and, slavic, voda, of, the, same, meaning, distilled, alcohol, was, known, in, latin, as, aqua, vitae, water, of, life, this, was, translated, into, middle, irish, as, uisce, betha, which, became, uisce, beatha, irish, pronunciation, in, irish, and, uisge, beatha, in, scottish, gaelic, early, forms, of, the, word, in, english, included, uskebeaghe, 1581, usquebaugh, 1610, usquebath, 1621, and, usquebae, 1715, much, is, made, of, the, word, s, two, spellings, whisky, and, whiskey, there, are, two, schools, of, thought, on, the, issue, one, is, that, the, spelling, difference, is, simply, a, matter, of, regional, language, convention, for, the, spelling, of, a, word, indicating, that, the, spelling, varies, depending, on, the, intended, audience, or, the, background, or, personal, preferences, of, the, writer, like, the, difference, between, color, and, colour, or, recognize, and, recognise, and, the, other, is, that, the, spelling, should, depend, on, the, style, or, origin, of, the, spirit, being, described, there, is, general, agreement, that, when, quoting, the, proper, name, printed, on, a, label, one, should, not, alter, its, spelling, the, spelling, whiskey, is, common, in, ireland, and, the, united, states, while, whisky, is, used, in, all, other, whisky, producing, countries, in, the, us, the, usage, has, not, always, been, consistent, from, the, late, eighteenth, century, to, the, mid, twentieth, century, american, writers, used, both, spellings, interchangeably, until, the, introduction, of, newspaper, style, guides, since, the, 1960s, american, writers, have, increasingly, used, whiskey, as, the, accepted, spelling, for, aged, grain, spirits, made, in, the, us, and, whisky, for, aged, grain, spirits, made, outside, the, us, however, some, prominent, american, brands, such, as, george, dickel, maker, s, mark, and, old, forester, all, made, by, different, companies, use, the, whisky, spelling, on, their, labels, and, the, standards, of, identity, for, distilled, spirits, the, legal, regulations, for, spirit, in, the, us, also, use, the, whisky, spelling, throughout, whisky, made, in, scotland, is, simply, called, whisky, within, scotland, elsewhere, and, in, the, regulations, of, the, scotch, whisky, association, swa, that, govern, its, production, it, is, commonly, called, scotch, whisky, or, simply, scotch, especially, in, north, america, it, is, possible, that, distillation, was, practised, by, the, babylonians, in, mesopotamia, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, with, perfumes, and, aromatics, being, distilled, but, this, is, subject, to, uncertain, and, disputed, interpretations, of, evidence, the, earliest, certain, chemical, distillations, were, by, greeks, in, alexandria, in, the, 1st, century, ad, but, these, were, not, distillations, of, alcohol, the, medieval, arabs, adopted, the, distillation, technique, of, the, alexandrian, greeks, and, written, records, in, arabic, begin, in, the, 9th, century, but, again, these, were, not, distillations, of, alcohol, distilling, technology, passed, from, the, medieval, arabs, to, the, medieval, latins, with, the, earliest, records, in, latin, in, the, early, 12th, century, the, earliest, records, of, the, distillation, of, alcohol, are, in, italy, in, the, 13th, century, where, alcohol, was, distilled, from, wine, an, early, description, of, the, technique, was, given, by, ramon, llull, 1232, 1315, its, use, spread, through, medieval, monasteries, largely, for, medicinal, purposes, such, as, the, treatment, of, colic, and, smallpox, the, practice, of, distillation, spread, to, ireland, and, scotland, no, later, than, the, 15th, century, as, did, the, common, european, practice, of, distilling, aqua, vitae, spirit, alcohol, primarily, for, medicinal, purposes, the, practice, of, medicinal, distillation, eventually, passed, from, a, monastic, setting, to, the, secular, via, professional, medical, practitioners, of, the, time, the, guild, of, barber, surgeons, the, earliest, mention, of, whiskey, in, ireland, comes, from, the, annals, of, clonmacnoise, which, attributes, the, death, of, a, chieftain, in, 1405, to, taking, a, surfeit, of, aqua, vitae, at, christmas, in, scotland, the, first, evidence, of, whisky, production, comes, from, an, entry, in, the, exchequer, rolls, for, 1495, where, malt, is, sent, to, friar, john, cor, by, order, of, the, king, to, make, aquavitae, enough, to, make, about, 500, bottles, james, iv, of, scotland, r, 1488, 1513, reportedly, had, a, great, liking, for, scotch, whisky, and, in, 1506, the, town, of, dundee, purchased, a, large, amount, of, whisky, from, the, guild, of, barber, surgeons, which, held, the, monopoly, on, production, at, the, time, the, distillation, process, was, still, in, its, infancy, whisky, itself, was, not, allowed, to, age, and, as, a, result, tasted, very, raw, and, brutal, compared, to, today, s, versions, renaissance, era, whisky, was, also, very, potent, and, not, diluted, over, time, whisky, evolved, into, a, much, smoother, drink, in, 1707, the, acts, of, union, merged, england, and, scotland, into, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, thereafter, taxes, on, distilled, spirits, rose, dramatically, following, parliament, s, divisive, malt, tax, of, 1725, most, of, scotland, s, distillation, was, either, shut, down, or, forced, underground, scotch, whisky, was, hidden, under, altars, in, coffins, and, in, any, available, space, to, avoid, the, governmental, excisemen, or, revenuers, scottish, distillers, operating, out, of, homemade, stills, took, to, distilling, whisky, at, night, when, the, darkness, hid, the, smoke, from, the, stills, for, this, reason, the, drink, became, known, as, moonshine, at, one, point, it, was, estimated, that, over, half, of, scotland, s, whisky, output, was, illegal, in, america, whisky, was, used, as, currency, during, the, american, revolution, george, washington, operated, a, large, distillery, at, mount, vernon, given, the, distances, and, primitive, transportation, network, of, colonial, america, farmers, often, found, it, easier, and, more, profitable, to, convert, corn, to, whisky, and, transport, it, to, market, in, that, form, it, also, was, a, highly, coveted, trade, good, and, when, an, additional, excise, tax, was, levied, against, it, in, 1791, the, whiskey, rebellion, erupted, the, drinking, of, scotch, whisky, was, introduced, to, india, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, distillery, in, india, was, built, by, edward, dyer, at, kasauli, in, the, late, 1820s, the, operation, was, soon, shifted, to, nearby, solan, close, to, the, british, summer, capital, shimla, as, there, was, an, abundant, supply, of, fresh, spring, water, there, in, 1823, the, uk, passed, the, excise, act, legalizing, the, distillation, for, a, fee, and, this, put, a, practical, end, to, the, large, scale, production, of, scottish, moonshine, in, 1831, aeneas, coffey, patented, the, coffey, still, allowing, for, a, cheaper, and, more, efficient, distillation, of, whisky, in, 1850, andrew, usher, began, producing, a, blended, whisky, that, mixed, traditional, pot, still, whisky, with, that, from, the, new, coffey, still, the, new, distillation, method, was, scoffed, at, by, some, irish, distillers, who, clung, to, their, traditional, pot, stills, many, irish, contended, that, the, new, product, was, in, fact, not, whisky, at, all, by, the, 1880s, the, french, brandy, industry, was, devastated, by, the, phylloxera, pest, that, ruined, much, of, the, grape, crop, as, a, result, whisky, became, the, primary, liquor, in, many, markets, during, the, prohibition, era, in, the, united, states, lasting, from, 1920, to, 1933, all, alcohol, sales, were, banned, in, the, country, the, federal, government, made, an, exemption, for, whisky, prescribed, by, a, doctor, and, sold, through, licensed, pharmacies, such, as, walgreens, although, specific, methods, may, vary, among, distilleries, whisky, production, broadly, comprises, four, primary, stages, grain, preparation, fermentation, distillation, and, maturation, aging, this, process, is, typically, followed, by, the, two, additional, stages, of, bottling, and, marketing, to, initiate, whisky, production, grains, are, processed, to, convert, their, starches, into, fermentable, sugars, which, can, then, be, subjected, to, fermentation, and, distillation, this, process, involves, malting, milling, and, mashing, the, grains, malt, production, begins, with, the, soaking, of, grains, in, water, tanks, for, a, period, of, three, days, the, soaked, grains, are, then, transferred, to, large, containers, where, germination, occurs, initiating, the, metabolic, process, that, converts, starches, into, sugars, this, process, is, subsequently, halted, by, drying, the, grains, with, hot, air, a, procedure, also, known, as, kilning, at, the, end, of, which, the, product, is, malt, in, the, production, of, scotch, whisky, the, air, used, for, kilning, is, heated, by, burning, peat, bricks, in, a, furnace, imparting, the, characteristic, smoky, flavour, to, the, malt, following, the, malting, process, the, grains, are, transferred, to, a, dressing, machine, which, separates, the, sprouts, from, the, seeds, the, grains, are, then, conveyed, to, a, mill, for, grinding, the, extraction, of, sugars, to, be, converted, into, alcohol, is, achieved, through, a, process, known, as, mashing, during, mashing, the, diastase, enzyme, is, activated, which, facilitates, the, conversion, of, starches, and, dextrins, into, sugars, the, ground, malt, is, introduced, into, a, mashtun, a, large, vat, containing, hot, water, and, is, agitated, for, approximately, thirty, minutes, or, more, the, water, is, then, drained, from, the, mashtun, which, is, subsequently, refilled, with, hot, water, this, procedure, is, typically, repeated, between, one, and, three, times, once, complete, the, resulting, liquid, known, as, wort, which, contains, the, extracted, sugars, is, separated, from, the, mash, cooled, and, transferred, to, the, washbacks, or, fermenting, vats, during, fermentation, a, specific, strain, of, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, commonly, known, as, brewer, s, yeast, is, introduced, to, the, sugary, wort, which, provides, the, necessary, nutrients, for, its, asexual, reproduction, the, yeast, metabolizes, the, sugars, producing, alcohol, carbon, dioxide, and, congeners, which, can, influence, the, flavor, profile, of, the, whisky, either, enhancing, or, suppressing, desirable, characteristics, the, fermenting, vats, are, maintained, within, a, controlled, temperature, range, typically, between, 10, c, and, 37, 8, c, which, is, optimal, for, yeast, activity, distillers, ensure, consistency, by, using, the, same, yeast, strain, to, achieve, uniformity, in, the, final, whiskey, product, fermentation, continues, for, two, days, or, longer, until, the, alcohol, content, of, the, liquid, reaches, between, 5, and, 10, once, fermentation, is, complete, and, the, yeast, ceases, to, be, active, the, resulting, liquid, is, referred, to, as, wash, or, distiller, s, beer, even, though, the, wash, is, alcoholic, it, is, still, organic, which, makes, it, susceptible, to, contamination, by, microorganisms, that, cause, rot, consequently, it, is, promptly, transferred, to, the, still, for, boiling, to, mitigate, this, risk, the, decision, to, transfer, either, the, entire, wash, or, only, the, most, liquid, portion, into, the, still, is, at, the, discretion, of, the, distiller, and, each, choice, affects, the, flavor, profile, of, the, final, product, in, distinct, ways, following, the, transfer, of, the, wash, the, still, is, heated, to, a, temperature, sufficient, to, evaporate, the, alcohol, while, remaining, low, enough, to, prevent, the, evaporation, of, water, alcohol, vapour, ascends, through, the, still, and, is, directed, to, the, condenser, which, consists, of, copper, tubes, or, plates, where, it, condenses, back, into, a, liquid, form, known, as, the, distilled, spirit, this, distilled, spirit, is, meticulously, monitored, during, its, extraction, the, initial, and, final, portions, of, the, distillate, are, deemed, undesirable, and, are, therefore, redirected, back, into, the, still, only, the, middle, portion, considered, the, most, desirable, is, collected, in, the, spirits, receiver, at, this, stage, the, distilled, spirit, is, clear, and, has, an, ethanol, content, ranging, from, 70, to, 80, abv, it, is, typically, diluted, before, being, transferred, to, casks, for, maturation, though, some, distilleries, sell, it, as, is, at, cask, strength, a, still, for, making, whisky, is, usually, made, of, copper, since, it, removes, sulfur, based, compounds, from, the, alcohol, that, would, make, it, unpleasant, to, drink, modern, stills, are, made, of, stainless, steel, with, copper, innards, piping, for, example, will, be, lined, with, copper, along, with, copper, plate, inlays, along, still, walls, the, simplest, standard, distillation, apparatus, is, commonly, known, as, a, pot, still, consisting, of, a, single, heated, chamber, and, a, vessel, to, collect, purified, alcohol, column, stills, are, frequently, used, in, the, production, of, grain, whisky, and, are, the, most, commonly, used, type, of, still, in, the, production, of, bourbon, and, other, american, whiskeys, column, stills, behave, like, a, series, of, single, pot, stills, formed, in, a, long, vertical, tube, whereas, a, single, pot, still, charged, with, wine, might, yield, a, vapour, enriched, to, 40, 60, alcohol, a, column, still, can, achieve, a, vapour, alcohol, content, of, 95, 6, an, azeotropic, mixture, of, alcohol, and, water, whiskies, do, not, mature, in, the, bottle, only, in, the, cask, so, the, age, of, a, whisky, is, only, the, time, between, distillation, and, bottling, this, reflects, how, much, the, cask, has, interacted, with, the, whisky, changing, its, chemical, makeup, and, taste, whiskies, that, have, been, bottled, for, many, years, may, have, a, rarity, value, but, are, not, older, and, not, necessarily, better, than, a, more, recent, whisky, that, matured, in, wood, for, a, similar, time, after, a, decade, or, two, additional, aging, in, a, barrel, does, not, necessarily, improve, a, whisky, and, excessive, aging, will, even, affect, it, negatively, the, minimum, aging, period, required, for, whisky, varies, by, country, in, the, united, states, the, minimum, aging, requirement, is, typically, 2, years, while, in, scotland, ireland, and, canada, it, is, generally, 3, years, while, aging, in, wooden, casks, especially, american, oak, and, french, oak, casks, whisky, undergoes, six, processes, that, contribute, to, its, colour, and, final, flavour, extraction, evaporation, oxidation, concentration, filtration, and, colouration, extraction, in, particular, results, in, whisky, acquiring, a, number, of, compounds, including, aldehydes, and, acids, such, as, vanillin, vanillic, acid, and, syringaldehyde, the, casks, used, for, aging, bourbon, whiskey, are, required, to, be, new, and, charred, after, being, used, for, this, purpose, these, casks, are, typically, exported, for, use, in, the, aging, of, other, whiskies, elsewhere, distillers, will, sometimes, age, their, whiskey, in, barrels, previously, used, to, age, other, spirits, such, as, port, rum, or, sherry, to, impart, particular, flavours, the, size, of, the, barrel, also, has, an, effect, on, the, flavour, development, of, the, whisky, smaller, barrels, will, contribute, more, to, the, whisky, due, to, the, higher, wood, surface, to, whisky, ratio, during, maturation, up, to, 45, litres, of, whisky, may, evaporate, from, the, cask, over, a, 4, year, period, this, portion, is, called, the, angel, s, share, by, distillers, most, whiskies, are, sold, at, or, near, an, alcoholic, strength, of, 40, abv, which, is, the, statutory, minimum, in, some, countries, although, the, strength, can, vary, and, cask, strength, whisky, may, have, as, much, as, twice, that, alcohol, percentage, enthusiasts, often, prefer, cask, strength, whisky, for, its, concentrated, flavors, and, customizable, dilution, experience, the, uk, exports, more, whisky, than, the, rest, of, the, world, combined, in, 2022, whisky, exports, from, scotland, were, valued, at, 6, 25, billion, making, up, a, quarter, of, all, uk, food, and, drink, export, revenues, in, 2012, the, us, was, the, largest, market, for, scotch, whisky, 655, million, followed, by, france, 535, million, it, is, also, one, of, the, uk, s, overall, top, five, manufacturing, export, earners, and, it, supports, around, 42, 000, jobs, principal, whisky, producing, areas, include, speyside, and, the, isle, of, islay, where, there, are, nine, distilleries, providing, a, major, source, of, employment, in, many, places, the, industry, is, closely, linked, to, tourism, with, many, distilleries, also, functioning, as, attractions, worth, 30, million, gva, each, year, in, 2011, 70, of, canadian, whisky, was, exported, with, about, 60, going, to, the, us, and, the, rest, mostly, to, europe, and, asia, 15, million, cases, of, canadian, whisky, were, sold, in, the, us, in, 2011, whisky, or, whisky, like, products, are, produced, in, most, grain, growing, areas, they, differ, in, base, product, alcoholic, content, and, quality, malts, and, grains, are, combined, in, various, ways, american, whiskey, is, distilled, from, a, fermented, mash, of, cereal, grain, it, must, have, the, taste, aroma, and, other, characteristics, commonly, attributed, to, whiskey, some, types, of, whiskey, listed, in, the, united, states, federal, regulations, are, these, types, of, american, whiskey, must, be, distilled, to, no, more, than, 80, alcohol, by, volume, and, barrelled, at, no, more, than, 125, proof, only, water, may, be, added, to, the, final, product, the, addition, of, colouring, or, flavouring, is, prohibited, these, whiskeys, must, be, aged, in, new, charred, oak, containers, except, for, corn, whiskey, which, does, not, have, to, be, aged, if, it, is, aged, it, must, be, in, uncharred, oak, barrels, or, in, used, barrels, corn, whiskey, is, usually, unaged, and, sold, as, a, legal, version, of, moonshine, there, is, no, minimum, aging, period, required, for, a, spirit, to, legally, be, called, whiskey, if, one, of, these, whiskey, types, reaches, two, years, aging, or, beyond, it, is, additionally, designated, as, straight, e, g, straight, rye, whiskey, a, whiskey, that, fulfils, all, above, requirements, but, derives, from, less, than, 51, of, any, one, specific, grain, can, be, called, simply, a, straight, whiskey, without, naming, a, grain, us, regulations, recognize, other, whiskey, categories, including, another, important, labelling, in, the, marketplace, is, tennessee, whiskey, which, includes, brands, such, as, jack, daniel, s, george, dickel, collier, and, mckeel, and, benjamin, prichard, s, the, main, difference, defining, a, tennessee, whiskey, is, that, it, must, be, filtered, through, sugar, maple, charcoal, before, aging, known, as, the, lincoln, county, process, benjamin, prichard, s, which, is, not, so, filtered, was, grandfathered, in, when, the, requirement, was, introduced, in, 2017, the, rest, of, the, distillation, process, of, tennessee, whiskey, is, identical, to, bourbon, whiskey, whiskey, sold, as, tennessee, whiskey, is, defined, as, bourbon, under, nafta, and, at, least, one, other, international, trade, agreement, and, is, similarly, required, to, meet, the, legal, definition, of, bourbon, under, canadian, law, australian, whiskies, have, won, global, whisky, awards, and, medals, including, the, world, whiskies, awards, and, jim, murray, s, whisky, bible, liquid, gold, awards, by, canadian, law, canadian, whiskies, must, be, produced, and, aged, in, canada, be, distilled, from, a, fermented, mash, of, cereal, grain, be, aged, in, wood, barrels, with, a, capacity, limit, of, 700, litres, 185, us, gal, 154, imp, gal, for, not, less, than, three, years, and, possess, the, aroma, taste, and, character, generally, attributed, to, canadian, whisky, the, terms, canadian, whisky, rye, whisky, and, canadian, rye, whisky, are, legally, indistinguishable, in, canada, and, do, not, require, any, specific, grain, in, their, production, and, are, often, blends, of, two, or, more, grains, canadian, whiskies, may, contain, caramel, and, flavouring, in, addition, to, the, distilled, mash, spirits, and, there, is, no, maximum, limit, on, the, alcohol, level, of, the, distillation, the, minimum, bottling, proof, is, 40, abv, to, be, exported, under, one, of, the, canadian, whisky, designations, a, whisky, cannot, contain, more, than, 9, 09, imported, spirits, canadian, whiskies, are, available, throughout, the, world, and, are, a, culturally, significant, export, well, known, brands, include, crown, royal, canadian, club, seagram, s, and, wiser, s, among, others, the, historic, popularity, of, canadian, whisky, in, the, united, states, is, partly, a, result, of, rum, runners, illegally, importing, it, into, the, country, during, the, period, of, american, prohibition, denmark, began, producing, whisky, early, in, 1974, the, first, danish, single, malt, to, go, on, sale, was, lille, gadeg, rd, from, bornholm, in, 2005, lille, gadeg, rd, is, a, winery, as, well, and, uses, its, own, wine, casks, to, mature, whisky, the, second, danish, distilled, single, malt, whisky, for, sale, was, edition, no, 1, from, the, braunstein, microbrewery, and, distillery, it, was, distilled, in, 2007, using, water, from, the, greenlandic, ice, sheet, and, entered, the, market, in, march, 2010, another, distillery, is, stauning, whisky, based, in, jutland, nyborg, destilleri, from, the, island, funen, fyn, in, the, center, of, denmark, produces, organic, whisky, and, other, organic, spirits, the, distillery, was, established, in, 2009, and, in, 2020, they, launched, their, first, 10, year, old, whisky, distillers, operated, in, london, liverpool, and, bristol, until, the, late, 19th, century, after, which, production, of, english, single, malt, whisky, ceased, until, 2003, there, are, currently, 55, distilleries, producing, english, whisky, and, 20, brands, of, english, whisky, an, english, whisky, gi, is, currently, awaiting, approval, in, 2005, there, were, two, working, distilleries, in, finland, and, a, third, one, under, construction, whisky, retail, sales, in, finland, are, controlled, solely, by, the, state, alcohol, monopoly, alko, and, advertising, of, strong, alcoholic, beverages, is, banned, french, whisky, is, whisky, produced, in, france, the, distilleries, producing, french, whisky, include, glann, ar, mor, and, warenghem, in, brittany, guillon, in, the, champagne, region, and, grallet, dupic, in, lorraine, buckwheat, whisky, is, produced, by, distillerie, des, menhirs, in, plomelin, brittany, in, 2022, there, were, around, 100, whisky, producers, in, france, the, first, french, whisky, was, produced, at, warenghem, distillery, in, 1987, who, then, introduced, the, first, single, malt, french, whisky, in, 1998, according, to, a, study, in, 2016, the, french, are, the, largest, consumers, of, single, malt, whisky, in, the, world, especially, scotch, german, whisky, production, is, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, having, only, started, in, the, early, 1990s, the, styles, produced, resemble, those, made, in, ireland, scotland, and, the, united, states, single, malts, blends, wheat, and, bourbon, like, styles, there, is, no, standard, spelling, of, german, whiskies, with, distilleries, using, both, whisky, and, whiskey, in, 2008, there, were, 23, distilleries, in, germany, producing, whisky, distilled, alcoholic, beverages, that, are, labelled, as, whisky, in, india, were, commonly, blends, based, on, neutral, spirits, that, are, distilled, from, fermented, molasses, grain, with, only, a, small, portion, consisting, of, traditional, malt, whisky, usually, about, 10, to, 12, percent, outside, india, such, a, drink, would, more, likely, be, labelled, a, rum, according, to, the, scotch, whisky, association, s, 2013, annual, report, there, is, no, compulsory, definition, of, whisky, in, india, and, the, indian, voluntary, standard, does, not, require, whisky, to, be, distilled, from, cereals, or, to, be, matured,
