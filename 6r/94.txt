meat, is, animal, tissue, often, muscle, that, is, eaten, as, food, humans, have, hunted, and, farmed, other, animals, for, meat, since, prehistory, the, neolithic, revolution, allowed, the, domestication, of, animals, including, chickens, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and, cattle, starting, around, 11, 000, years, ago, since, then, selective, breeding, has, enabled, farmers, to, produce, meat, with, the, qualities, desired, by, producers, and, consumers, meat, is, mainly, composed, of, water, protein, and, fat, its, quality, is, affected, by, many, factors, including, the, genetics, and, nutritional, status, of, the, animal, involved, it, is, edible, raw, but, is, normally, eaten, cooked, such, as, by, stewing, or, roasting, or, processed, such, as, by, smoking, or, salting, bacteria, and, fungi, decompose, and, spoil, unprocessed, meat, within, hours, or, days, the, consumption, of, meat, especially, red, and, processed, meat, causes, health, effects, including, increased, risks, of, cancer, coronary, heart, disease, and, diabetes, meat, production, is, a, major, contributor, to, environmental, issues, including, global, warming, pollution, and, biodiversity, loss, at, every, scale, from, local, to, global, meat, is, important, to, economies, and, cultures, around, the, world, some, people, choose, not, to, eat, meat, vegetarians, for, reasons, such, as, ethics, environmental, effects, health, concerns, or, religious, dietary, rules, the, word, meat, comes, from, the, old, english, word, mete, meaning, food, in, general, in, modern, usage, meat, primarily, means, skeletal, muscle, with, its, associated, fat, and, connective, tissue, but, it, can, include, offal, other, edible, organs, such, as, liver, and, kidney, the, term, is, sometimes, used, in, a, more, restrictive, sense, to, mean, the, flesh, of, mammalian, species, pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, etc, raised, and, prepared, for, human, consumption, to, the, exclusion, of, fish, other, seafood, insects, poultry, or, other, animals, english, has, specialized, terms, for, the, meat, of, particular, animals, deriving, from, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, while, the, animals, retained, their, english, names, their, meat, as, brought, to, the, tables, of, the, invaders, was, named, in, norman, french, these, names, came, to, be, used, by, the, entire, population, paleontological, evidence, suggests, that, meat, constituted, a, substantial, proportion, of, the, diet, of, the, earliest, humans, early, hunter, gatherers, depended, on, the, organized, hunting, of, large, animals, such, as, bison, and, deer, animals, were, domesticated, in, the, neolithic, enabling, the, systematic, production, of, meat, and, the, breeding, of, animals, to, improve, meat, production, in, the, postwar, period, governments, gave, farmers, guaranteed, prices, to, increase, animal, production, the, effect, was, to, raise, output, at, the, cost, of, increased, inputs, such, as, of, animal, feed, and, veterinary, medicines, as, well, as, of, animal, disease, and, environmental, pollution, in, 1966, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, other, industrialized, nations, began, factory, farming, of, beef, and, dairy, cattle, and, domestic, pigs, intensive, animal, farming, became, globalized, in, the, later, years, of, the, 20th, century, replacing, traditional, stock, rearing, in, countries, around, the, world, in, 1990, intensive, animal, farming, accounted, for, 30, of, world, meat, production, and, by, 2005, this, had, risen, to, 40, modern, agriculture, employs, techniques, such, as, progeny, testing, to, speed, selective, breeding, allowing, the, rapid, acquisition, of, the, qualities, desired, by, meat, producers, for, instance, in, the, wake, of, well, publicized, health, concerns, associated, with, saturated, fats, in, the, 1980s, the, fat, content, of, united, kingdom, beef, pork, and, lamb, fell, from, 20, 26, percent, to, 4, 8, percent, within, a, few, decades, due, to, both, selective, breeding, for, leanness, and, changed, methods, of, butchery, methods, of, genetic, engineering, that, could, improve, the, meat, producing, qualities, of, animals, are, becoming, available, meat, production, continues, to, be, shaped, by, the, demands, of, customers, the, trend, towards, selling, meat, in, pre, packaged, cuts, has, increased, the, demand, for, larger, breeds, of, cattle, better, suited, to, producing, such, cuts, animals, not, previously, exploited, for, their, meat, are, now, being, farmed, including, mammals, such, as, antelope, zebra, water, buffalo, and, camel, as, well, as, non, mammals, such, as, crocodile, emu, and, ostrich, organic, farming, supports, an, increasing, demand, for, meat, produced, to, that, standard, several, factors, affect, the, growth, and, development, of, meat, some, economically, important, traits, in, meat, animals, are, heritable, to, some, degree, and, can, thus, be, selected, for, by, animal, breeding, in, cattle, certain, growth, features, are, controlled, by, recessive, genes, which, have, not, so, far, been, controlled, complicating, breeding, one, such, trait, is, dwarfism, another, is, the, doppelender, or, double, muscling, condition, which, causes, muscle, hypertrophy, and, thereby, increases, the, animal, s, commercial, value, genetic, analysis, continues, to, reveal, the, genetic, mechanisms, that, control, numerous, aspects, of, the, endocrine, system, and, through, it, meat, growth, and, quality, genetic, engineering, techniques, can, shorten, breeding, programs, significantly, because, they, allow, for, the, identification, and, isolation, of, genes, coding, for, desired, traits, and, for, the, reincorporation, of, these, genes, into, the, animal, genome, to, enable, such, manipulation, the, genomes, of, many, animals, are, being, mapped, some, research, has, already, seen, commercial, application, for, instance, a, recombinant, bacterium, has, been, developed, which, improves, the, digestion, of, grass, in, the, rumen, of, cattle, and, some, specific, features, of, muscle, fibers, have, been, genetically, altered, experimental, reproductive, cloning, of, commercially, important, meat, animals, such, as, sheep, pig, or, cattle, has, been, successful, multiple, asexual, reproduction, of, animals, bearing, desirable, traits, is, anticipated, heat, regulation, in, livestock, is, of, economic, significance, as, mammals, attempt, to, maintain, a, constant, optimal, body, temperature, low, temperatures, tend, to, prolong, animal, development, and, high, temperatures, tend, to, delay, it, depending, on, their, size, body, shape, and, insulation, through, tissue, and, fur, some, animals, have, a, relatively, narrow, zone, of, temperature, tolerance, and, others, e, g, cattle, a, broad, one, static, magnetic, fields, for, reasons, still, unknown, retard, animal, development, the, quality, and, quantity, of, usable, meat, depends, on, the, animal, s, plane, of, nutrition, i, e, whether, it, is, over, or, underfed, scientists, disagree, about, how, exactly, the, plane, of, nutrition, influences, carcase, composition, the, composition, of, the, diet, especially, the, amount, of, protein, provided, is, an, important, factor, regulating, animal, growth, ruminants, which, may, digest, cellulose, are, better, adapted, to, poor, quality, diets, but, their, ruminal, microorganisms, degrade, high, quality, protein, if, supplied, in, excess, because, producing, high, quality, protein, animal, feed, is, expensive, several, techniques, are, employed, or, experimented, with, to, ensure, maximum, utilization, of, protein, these, include, the, treatment, of, feed, with, formalin, to, protect, amino, acids, during, their, passage, through, the, rumen, the, recycling, of, manure, by, feeding, it, back, to, cattle, mixed, with, feed, concentrates, or, the, conversion, of, petroleum, hydrocarbons, to, protein, through, microbial, action, in, plant, feed, environmental, factors, influence, the, availability, of, crucial, nutrients, or, micronutrients, a, lack, or, excess, of, which, can, cause, a, great, many, ailments, in, australia, where, the, soil, contains, limited, phosphate, cattle, are, fed, additional, phosphate, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, beef, production, also, in, australia, cattle, and, sheep, in, certain, areas, were, often, found, losing, their, appetite, and, dying, in, the, midst, of, rich, pasture, this, was, found, to, be, a, result, of, cobalt, deficiency, in, the, soil, plant, toxins, are, a, risk, to, grazing, animals, for, instance, sodium, fluoroacetate, found, in, some, african, and, australian, plants, kills, by, disrupting, the, cellular, metabolism, some, man, made, pollutants, such, as, methylmercury, and, some, pesticide, residues, present, a, particular, hazard, as, they, bioaccumulate, in, meat, potentially, poisoning, consumers, practices, such, as, confinement, in, factory, farming, have, generated, concerns, for, animal, welfare, animals, have, abnormal, behaviors, such, as, tail, biting, cannibalism, and, feather, pecking, invasive, procedures, such, as, beak, trimming, castration, and, ear, notching, have, similarly, been, questioned, breeding, for, high, productivity, may, affect, welfare, as, when, broiler, chickens, are, bred, to, be, very, large, and, to, grow, rapidly, broilers, often, have, leg, deformities, and, become, lame, and, many, die, from, the, stress, of, handling, and, transport, meat, producers, may, seek, to, improve, the, fertility, of, female, animals, through, the, administration, of, gonadotrophic, or, ovulation, inducing, hormones, in, pig, production, sow, infertility, is, a, common, problem, possibly, due, to, excessive, fatness, no, methods, currently, exist, to, augment, the, fertility, of, male, animals, artificial, insemination, is, now, routinely, used, to, produce, animals, of, the, best, possible, genetic, quality, and, the, efficiency, of, this, method, is, improved, through, the, administration, of, hormones, that, synchronize, the, ovulation, cycles, within, groups, of, females, growth, hormones, particularly, anabolic, agents, such, as, steroids, are, used, in, some, countries, to, accelerate, muscle, growth, in, animals, this, practice, has, given, rise, to, the, beef, hormone, controversy, an, international, trade, dispute, it, may, decrease, the, tenderness, of, meat, although, research, on, this, is, inconclusive, and, have, other, effects, on, the, composition, of, the, muscle, flesh, where, castration, is, used, to, improve, control, over, male, animals, its, side, effects, can, be, counteracted, by, the, administration, of, hormones, myostatin, has, been, used, to, produce, muscle, hypertrophy, sedatives, may, be, administered, to, animals, to, counteract, stress, factors, and, increase, weight, gain, the, feeding, of, antibiotics, to, certain, animals, increases, growth, rates, this, practice, is, particularly, prevalent, in, the, us, but, has, been, banned, in, the, eu, partly, because, it, causes, antimicrobial, resistance, in, pathogenic, microorganisms, the, biochemical, composition, of, meat, varies, in, complex, ways, depending, on, the, species, breed, sex, age, plane, of, nutrition, training, and, exercise, of, the, animal, as, well, as, on, the, anatomical, location, of, the, musculature, involved, even, between, animals, of, the, same, litter, and, sex, there, are, considerable, differences, in, such, parameters, as, the, percentage, of, intramuscular, fat, adult, mammalian, muscle, consists, of, roughly, 75, percent, water, 19, percent, protein, 2, 5, percent, intramuscular, fat, 1, 2, percent, carbohydrates, and, 2, 3, percent, other, soluble, substances, these, include, organic, compounds, especially, amino, acids, and, inorganic, substances, such, as, minerals, muscle, proteins, are, either, soluble, in, water, sarcoplasmic, proteins, about, 11, 5, percent, of, total, muscle, mass, or, in, concentrated, salt, solutions, myofibrillar, proteins, about, 5, 5, percent, of, mass, there, are, several, hundred, sarcoplasmic, proteins, most, of, them, the, glycolytic, enzymes, are, involved, in, glycolysis, the, conversion, of, sugars, into, high, energy, molecules, especially, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, the, two, most, abundant, myofibrillar, proteins, myosin, and, actin, form, the, muscle, s, overall, structure, and, enable, it, to, deliver, power, consuming, atp, in, the, process, the, remaining, protein, mass, includes, connective, tissue, collagen, and, elastin, fat, in, meat, can, be, either, adipose, tissue, used, by, the, animal, to, store, energy, and, consisting, of, true, fats, esters, of, glycerol, with, fatty, acids, or, intramuscular, fat, which, contains, phospholipids, and, cholesterol, meat, can, be, broadly, classified, as, red, or, white, depending, on, the, concentration, of, myoglobin, in, muscle, fiber, when, myoglobin, is, exposed, to, oxygen, reddish, oxymyoglobin, develops, making, myoglobin, rich, meat, appear, red, the, redness, of, meat, depends, on, species, animal, age, and, fiber, type, red, meat, contains, more, narrow, muscle, fibers, that, tend, to, operate, over, long, periods, without, rest, while, white, meat, contains, more, broad, fibers, that, tend, to, work, in, short, fast, bursts, such, as, the, brief, flight, of, the, chicken, the, meat, of, adult, mammals, such, as, cows, sheep, and, horses, is, considered, red, while, chicken, and, turkey, breast, meat, is, considered, white, muscle, tissue, is, high, in, protein, containing, all, of, the, essential, amino, acids, and, in, most, cases, is, a, good, source, of, zinc, vitamin, b, 12, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, vitamin, b, 6, choline, riboflavin, and, iron, several, forms, of, meat, are, high, in, vitamin, k, muscle, tissue, is, very, low, in, carbohydrates, and, does, not, contain, dietary, fiber, the, fat, content, of, meat, varies, widely, with, the, species, and, breed, of, animal, the, way, in, which, the, animal, was, raised, what, it, was, fed, the, part, of, the, body, and, the, methods, of, butchering, and, cooking, wild, animals, such, as, deer, are, leaner, than, farm, animals, leading, those, concerned, about, fat, content, to, choose, game, such, as, venison, decades, of, breeding, meat, animals, for, fatness, is, being, reversed, by, consumer, demand, for, leaner, meat, the, fatty, deposits, near, the, muscle, fibers, in, meats, soften, meat, when, it, is, cooked, improve, its, flavor, and, make, the, meat, seem, juicier, fat, around, meat, further, contains, cholesterol, the, increase, in, meat, consumption, after, 1960, is, associated, with, significant, imbalances, of, fat, and, cholesterol, in, the, human, diet, biomass, of, mammals, on, earth, upon, reaching, a, predetermined, age, or, weight, livestock, are, usually, transported, en, masse, to, the, slaughterhouse, depending, on, its, length, and, circumstances, this, may, exert, stress, and, injuries, on, the, animals, and, some, may, die, en, route, unnecessary, stress, in, transport, may, adversely, affect, the, quality, of, the, meat, in, particular, the, muscles, of, stressed, animals, are, low, in, water, and, glycogen, and, their, ph, fails, to, attain, acidic, values, all, of, which, results, in, poor, meat, quality, animals, are, usually, slaughtered, by, being, first, stunned, and, then, exsanguinated, bled, out, death, results, from, the, one, or, the, other, procedure, depending, on, the, methods, employed, stunning, can, be, effected, through, asphyxiating, the, animals, with, carbon, dioxide, shooting, them, with, a, gun, or, a, captive, bolt, pistol, or, shocking, them, with, electric, current, the, exsanguination, is, accomplished, by, severing, the, carotid, artery, and, the, jugular, vein, in, cattle, and, sheep, and, the, anterior, vena, cava, in, pigs, draining, as, much, blood, as, possible, from, the, carcass, is, necessary, because, blood, causes, the, meat, to, have, an, unappealing, appearance, and, is, a, breeding, ground, for, microorganisms, after, exsanguination, the, carcass, is, dressed, that, is, the, head, feet, hide, except, hogs, and, some, veal, excess, fat, viscera, and, offal, are, removed, leaving, only, bones, and, edible, muscle, cattle, and, pig, carcases, but, not, those, of, sheep, are, then, split, in, half, along, the, mid, ventral, axis, and, the, carcase, is, cut, into, wholesale, pieces, the, dressing, and, cutting, sequence, long, a, province, of, manual, labor, is, being, progressively, automated, under, hygienic, conditions, and, without, other, treatment, meat, can, be, stored, at, above, its, freezing, point, 1, 5, c, for, about, six, weeks, without, spoilage, during, which, time, it, undergoes, an, aging, process, that, increases, its, tenderness, and, flavor, during, the, first, day, after, death, glycolysis, continues, until, the, accumulation, of, lactic, acid, causes, the, ph, to, reach, about, 5, 5, the, remaining, glycogen, about, 18, g, per, kg, increases, the, water, holding, capacity, and, tenderness, of, cooked, meat, rigor, mortis, sets, in, a, few, hours, after, death, as, adenosine, triphosphate, is, used, up, this, causes, the, muscle, proteins, actin, and, myosin, to, combine, into, rigid, actomyosin, this, in, turn, lowers, the, meat, s, water, holding, capacity, so, the, meat, loses, water, or, weeps, in, muscles, that, enter, rigor, in, a, contracted, position, actin, and, myosin, filaments, overlap, and, cross, bond, resulting, in, meat, that, becomes, tough, when, cooked, over, time, muscle, proteins, denature, in, varying, degree, with, the, exception, of, the, collagen, and, elastin, of, connective, tissue, and, rigor, mortis, resolves, these, changes, mean, that, meat, is, tender, and, pliable, when, cooked, just, after, death, or, after, the, resolution, of, rigor, but, tough, when, cooked, during, rigor, as, the, muscle, pigment, myoglobin, denatures, its, iron, oxidizes, which, may, cause, a, brown, discoloration, near, the, surface, of, the, meat, ongoing, proteolysis, contributes, to, conditioning, hypoxanthine, a, breakdown, product, of, atp, contributes, to, meat, s, flavor, and, odor, as, do, other, products, of, the, decomposition, of, muscle, fat, and, protein, when, meat, is, industrially, processed, additives, are, used, to, protect, or, modify, its, flavor, or, color, to, improve, its, tenderness, juiciness, or, cohesiveness, or, to, aid, with, its, preservation, a, bioarchaeological, specifically, isotopic, analysis, study, of, early, medieval, england, found, based, on, the, funerary, record, that, high, meat, protein, diets, were, extremely, rare, and, that, contrary, to, previously, held, assumptions, elites, did, not, consume, more, meat, than, non, elites, and, men, did, not, consume, more, meat, than, women, in, the, nineteenth, century, meat, consumption, in, britain, was, the, highest, in, europe, exceeded, only, by, that, in, british, colonies, in, the, 1830s, consumption, per, head, in, britain, was, about, 34, kilograms, 75, lb, a, year, rising, to, 59, kilograms, 130, lb, in, 1912, in, 1904, laborers, consumed, 39, kilograms, 87, lb, a, year, while, aristocrats, ate, 140, kilograms, 300, lb, there, were, some, 43, 000, butcher, s, shops, in, britain, in, 1910, with, possibly, more, money, invested, in, the, meat, industry, than, in, any, other, british, business, except, finance, the, us, was, a, meat, importing, country, by, 1926, truncated, lifespan, as, a, result, of, intensive, breeding, allows, more, meat, to, be, produced, from, fewer, animals, the, world, cattle, population, was, about, 600, million, in, 1929, with, 700, million, sheep, and, goats, and, 300, million, pigs, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, the, overall, consumption, for, white, meat, has, increased, from, the, 20th, to, the, 21st, centuries, poultry, meat, has, increased, by, 76, 6, per, kilo, per, capita, and, pig, meat, by, 19, 7, bovine, meat, has, decreased, from, 10, 4, kg, 22, lb, 15, oz, per, capita, in, 1990, to, 9, 6, kg, 21, lb, 3, oz, per, capita, in, 2009, fao, analysis, found, that, 357, million, tonnes, of, meat, were, produced, in, 2021, 53, more, than, in, 2000, with, chicken, meat, representing, more, than, half, the, increase, overall, diets, that, include, meat, are, the, most, common, worldwide, according, to, the, results, of, a, 2018, ipsos, mori, study, of, 16, 64, years, olds, in, 28, countries, ipsos, states, an, omnivorous, diet, is, the, most, common, diet, globally, with, non, meat, diets, which, can, include, fish, followed, by, over, a, tenth, of, the, global,

translational, genomics, research, institute, showed, that, nearly, half, 47, of, the, meat, and, poultry, in, u, s, grocery, stores, were, contaminated, with, s, aureus, with, more, than, half, 52, of, those, bacteria, resistant, to, antibiotics, a, 2018, investigation, by, the, bureau, of, investigative, journalism, and, the, guardian, found, that, around, 15, percent, of, the, us, population, suffers, from, foodborne, illnesses, every, year, the, investigation, highlighted, unsanitary, conditions, in, us, based, meat, plants, which, included, meat, products, covered, in, excrement, and, abscesses, filled, with, pus, complete, cooking, and, the, careful, avoidance, of, recontamination, reduce, the, risk, of, bacterial, infections, from, meat, consumption, of, 100, g, day, of, red, meat, and, 50, g, day, of, processed, meat, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, diabetes, diabetes, uk, advises, people, to, limit, their, intake, of, red, and, processed, meat, meat, production, and, trade, substantially, increase, risks, for, infectious, diseases, zoonosis, including, of, pandemics, whether, though, contact, with, wild, and, farmed, animals, or, via, husbandry, s, environmental, impact, for, example, avian, influenza, from, poultry, meat, production, is, a, threat, to, human, health, furthermore, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, meat, production, contributes, to, antimicrobial, resistance, which, contributes, to, millions, of, deaths, and, makes, it, harder, to, control, infectious, diseases, in, response, to, changing, meat, prices, as, well, as, health, concerns, about, saturated, fat, and, cholesterol, consumers, have, altered, their, consumption, of, various, meats, consumption, of, beef, in, the, united, states, between, 1970, and, 1974, and, 1990, 1994, dropped, by, 21, while, consumption, of, chicken, increased, by, 90, except, for, poultry, at, 50, g, day, unprocessed, red, and, processed, meat, are, risk, factors, for, ischemic, heart, disease, increasing, the, risk, by, about, 9, and, 18, respectively, a, multitude, of, serious, negative, environmental, effects, are, associated, with, meat, production, among, these, are, greenhouse, gas, emissions, fossil, energy, use, water, use, water, quality, changes, and, effects, on, grazed, ecosystems, they, are, so, significant, that, according, to, university, of, oxford, researchers, a, vegan, diet, is, probably, the, single, biggest, way, to, reduce, your, impact, on, planet, earth, far, bigger, than, cutting, down, on, your, flights, or, buying, an, electric, car, however, this, is, often, ignored, in, the, public, consciousness, and, in, plans, to, tackle, serious, environmental, issues, such, as, the, climate, crisis, the, livestock, sector, may, be, the, largest, source, of, water, pollution, due, to, animal, wastes, fertilizers, pesticides, and, it, contributes, to, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistance, it, accounts, for, over, 8, of, global, human, water, use, it, is, a, significant, driver, of, biodiversity, loss, and, ecosystems, as, it, causes, deforestation, ocean, dead, zones, species, extinction, land, degradation, pollution, overfishing, and, global, warming, cattle, farming, was, estimated, to, be, responsible, for, 80, per, cent, of, amazon, deforestation, in, 2008, due, to, the, clearing, of, forests, to, grow, animal, feed, especially, soya, and, cattle, ranching, environmental, effects, vary, among, livestock, production, systems, grazing, of, livestock, can, be, beneficial, for, some, wildlife, species, but, not, for, others, targeted, grazing, of, livestock, is, used, as, a, food, producing, alternative, to, herbicide, use, in, some, vegetation, management, meat, production, is, by, far, the, biggest, user, of, land, as, it, accounts, for, nearly, 40, of, the, global, land, surface, just, in, the, contiguous, united, states, 34, of, its, land, area, 265, million, hectares, or, 654, million, acres, are, used, as, pasture, and, rangeland, mostly, feeding, livestock, not, counting, 158, million, hectares, 391, million, acres, of, cropland, 20, some, of, which, is, used, for, producing, feed, for, livestock, roughly, 75, of, deforested, land, around, the, globe, is, used, for, livestock, pasture, deforestation, from, practices, like, slash, and, burn, releases, co, 2, and, removes, the, carbon, sink, of, grown, tropical, forest, ecosystems, which, substantially, mitigate, climate, change, land, use, is, a, major, pressure, on, pressure, on, fertile, soils, which, is, important, for, global, food, security, the, rising, global, consumption, of, carbon, intensive, meat, products, has, exploded, the, global, carbon, footprint, of, agriculture, according, to, some, top, scientists, meat, production, is, responsible, for, some, 35, of, global, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, and, 60, of, the, greenhouse, gases, attributable, to, food, production, some, nations, show, very, different, impacts, to, counterparts, within, the, same, group, with, brazil, and, australia, having, emissions, over, 200, higher, than, the, average, of, their, respective, income, groups, driven, by, meat, consumption, according, to, the, assessing, the, environmental, impacts, of, consumption, and, production, report, produced, by, united, nations, environment, programme, s, unep, international, panel, for, sustainable, resource, management, a, worldwide, transition, in, the, direction, of, a, meat, and, dairy, free, diet, is, indispensable, if, adverse, global, climate, change, were, to, be, prevented, a, 2019, report, in, the, lancet, recommended, that, global, meat, and, sugar, consumption, be, reduced, by, 50, percent, to, mitigate, climate, change, meat, consumption, in, western, societies, needs, to, be, reduced, by, up, to, 90, according, to, a, 2018, study, published, in, nature, the, 2019, special, report, by, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, called, for, significantly, reducing, meat, consumption, particularly, in, wealthy, countries, in, order, to, mitigate, and, adapt, to, climate, change, meat, consumption, is, a, primary, contributor, to, the, sixth, mass, extinction, a, 2017, study, by, the, world, wildlife, fund, found, that, 60, of, global, biodiversity, loss, is, attributable, to, meat, based, diets, in, particular, from, the, use, of, land, for, feed, crops, resulting, in, large, scale, loss, of, habitats, and, species, livestock, make, up, 60, of, the, biomass, of, all, mammals, on, earth, followed, by, humans, 36, and, wild, mammals, 4, in, november, 2017, 15, 364, world, scientists, signed, a, warning, to, humanity, calling, for, a, drastic, reduction, in, per, capita, consumption, of, meat, and, dietary, shifts, towards, mostly, plant, based, foods, the, 2019, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, recommended, a, reduction, in, meat, consumption, to, mitigate, biodiversity, loss, a, 2021, chatham, house, report, asserted, that, a, shift, towards, plant, based, diets, would, free, up, land, for, the, restoration, of, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, meat, consumption, is, predicted, to, rise, as, the, human, population, increases, and, becomes, more, affluent, this, in, turn, would, increase, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, further, reduce, biodiversity, the, environmental, impact, of, meat, production, can, be, reduced, on, the, farm, by, conversion, of, human, inedible, residues, of, food, crops, manure, from, meat, producing, livestock, is, used, as, fertilizer, it, may, be, composted, before, application, to, food, crops, substitution, of, animal, manures, for, synthetic, fertilizers, in, crop, production, can, be, environmentally, significant, as, between, 43, and, 88, mj, of, fossil, fuel, energy, are, used, per, kg, of, nitrogen, in, manufacture, of, synthetic, nitrogenous, fertilizers, the, ipcc, and, others, have, stated, that, meat, production, has, to, be, reduced, substantially, for, any, sufficient, mitigation, of, climate, change, and, at, least, initially, largely, through, shifts, towards, plant, based, diets, where, meat, consumption, is, high, personal, carbon, allowances, that, allow, a, certain, amount, of, free, meat, consumption, per, person, would, be, a, form, of, restriction, meat, taxes, would, be, a, type, of, fiscal, mechanism, meat, can, be, replaced, by, for, example, high, protein, iron, rich, low, emission, legumes, and, common, fungi, dietary, supplements, e, g, of, vitamin, b, 12, and, zinc, and, fortified, foods, cultured, meat, microbial, foods, mycoprotein, meat, substitutes, and, other, alternatives, such, as, those, based, on, mushrooms, legumes, pulses, and, other, food, sources, land, previously, used, for, meat, production, can, be, rewilded, the, biologists, rodolfo, dirzo, gerardo, ceballos, and, paul, r, ehrlich, state, that, it, is, the, massive, planetary, monopoly, of, industrial, meat, production, that, needs, to, be, curbed, while, respecting, the, cultural, traditions, of, indigenous, peoples, for, whom, meat, is, an, important, source, of, protein, meat, is, part, of, the, human, diet, in, most, cultures, where, it, often, has, symbolic, meaning, and, important, social, functions, ethical, issues, regarding, the, consumption, of, meat, include, objecting, to, the, act, of, killing, animals, or, to, the, agricultural, practices, used, in, meat, production, reasons, for, objecting, to, killing, animals, for, consumption, may, include, animal, rights, environmental, ethics, or, an, aversion, to, inflicting, pain, or, harm, on, sentient, animals, some, people, while, not, vegetarians, refuse, to, eat, the, flesh, of, certain, animals, for, cultural, or, religious, reasons, the, founders, of, western, philosophy, disagreed, about, the, ethics, of, eating, meat, plato, s, republic, has, socrates, describe, the, ideal, state, as, vegetarian, pythagoras, believed, that, humans, and, animals, were, equal, and, therefore, disapproved, of, meat, consumption, as, did, plutarch, whereas, zeno, and, epicurus, were, vegetarian, but, allowed, meat, eating, in, their, philosophy, conversely, aristotle, s, politics, assert, that, animals, as, inferior, beings, exist, to, serve, humans, including, as, food, augustine, drew, on, aristotle, to, argue, that, the, universe, s, natural, hierarchy, allows, humans, to, eat, animals, and, animals, to, eat, plants, enlightenment, philosophers, were, likewise, divided, descartes, wrote, that, animals, were, merely, animated, machines, while, kant, considered, them, inferior, beings, for, lack, of, discernment, means, rather, than, ends, but, voltaire, and, rousseau, disagreed, rousseau, argued, that, meat, eating, is, a, social, rather, than, a, natural, act, because, children, are, not, interested, in, meat, later, philosophers, examined, the, changing, practices, of, eating, meat, in, the, modern, age, as, part, of, a, process, of, detachment, from, animals, as, living, beings, norbert, elias, for, instance, noted, that, in, medieval, times, cooked, animals, were, brought, to, the, table, whole, but, that, since, the, renaissance, only, the, edible, parts, are, served, which, are, no, longer, recognizably, part, of, an, animal, modern, eaters, according, to, no, lie, vialles, demand, an, ellipsis, between, meat, and, dead, animals, for, instance, calves, eyes, are, no, longer, considered, a, delicacy, as, in, the, middle, ages, but, provoke, disgust, fernand, braudel, wrote, that, since, the, european, diet, of, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, was, particularly, heavy, in, meat, european, colonialism, helped, export, meat, eating, across, the, globe, as, colonized, peoples, took, up, the, culinary, habits, of, their, colonizers, which, they, associated, with, wealth, and, power, among, the, indian, religions, jainism, opposes, the, eating, of, meat, while, some, schools, of, buddhism, and, hinduism, advocate, but, do, not, mandate, vegetarianism, jewish, kashrut, dietary, rules, allow, certain, kosher, meats, and, forbid, others, treif, the, rules, prohibit, the, consumption, of, unclean, animals, such, as, pork, and, mixtures, of, meat, and, milk, similar, rules, apply, in, islamic, dietary, laws, the, quran, explicitly, forbids, meat, from, animals, that, die, naturally, blood, and, the, meat, of, pigs, which, are, haram, forbidden, as, opposed, to, halal, allowed, some, sikh, groups, oppose, eating, any, meat, research, in, applied, psychology, has, investigated, meat, eating, in, relation, to, morality, emotions, cognition, and, personality, psychological, research, suggests, meat, eating, is, correlated, with, masculinity, and, reduced, openness, to, experience, research, into, the, consumer, psychology, of, meat, is, relevant, both, to, meat, industry, marketing, and, to, those, advocating, eating, less, meat, unlike, most, other, foods, meat, is, not, perceived, as, gender, neutral, it, is, associated, with, men, and, masculinity, sociological, research, ranging, from, african, tribal, societies, to, contemporary, barbecues, indicates, that, men, are, much, more, likely, to, participate, in, preparing, meat, than, other, food, this, has, been, attributed, to, the, influence, of, traditional, male, gender, roles, in, view, of, what, jack, goody, calls, a, male, familiarity, with, killing, or, as, claude, l, vi, strauss, suggests, that, roasting, is, more, violent, than, boiling, by, and, large, at, least, in, modern, societies, men, tend, to, consume, more, meat, than, women, and, men, often, prefer, red, meat, whereas, women, tend, to, prefer, chicken, and, fish, this, article,
