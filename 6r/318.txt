dice, sg, die, or, dice, are, small, throwable, objects, with, marked, sides, that, can, rest, in, multiple, positions, they, are, used, for, generating, random, values, commonly, as, part, of, tabletop, games, including, dice, games, board, games, role, playing, games, and, games, of, chance, a, traditional, die, is, a, cube, with, each, of, its, six, faces, marked, with, a, different, number, of, dots, pips, from, one, to, six, when, thrown, or, rolled, the, die, comes, to, rest, showing, a, random, integer, from, one, to, six, on, its, upper, surface, with, each, value, being, equally, likely, dice, may, also, have, polyhedral, or, irregular, shapes, may, have, faces, marked, with, numerals, or, symbols, instead, of, pips, and, may, have, their, numbers, carved, out, from, the, material, of, the, dice, instead, of, marked, on, it, loaded, dice, are, specifically, designed, or, modified, to, favor, some, results, over, others, for, cheating, or, entertainment, dice, have, been, used, since, before, recorded, history, and, their, origin, is, uncertain, it, is, hypothesized, that, dice, developed, from, the, practice, of, fortune, telling, with, the, talus, of, hoofed, animals, colloquially, known, as, knucklebones, the, egyptian, game, of, senet, played, before, 3000, bce, and, up, to, the, 2nd, century, ce, was, played, with, flat, two, sided, throwsticks, which, indicated, the, number, of, squares, a, player, could, move, and, thus, functioned, as, a, form, of, dice, perhaps, the, oldest, known, dice, were, excavated, as, part, of, a, backgammon, like, game, set, at, the, burnt, city, an, archeological, site, in, south, eastern, iran, estimated, to, be, from, between, 2800, and, 2500, bce, bone, dice, from, skara, brae, scotland, have, been, dated, to, 3100, 2400, bce, excavations, from, graves, at, mohenjo, daro, an, indus, valley, civilization, settlement, unearthed, terracotta, dice, dating, to, 2500, 1900, bce, including, at, least, one, die, whose, opposite, sides, all, add, up, to, seven, as, in, modern, dice, games, involving, dice, are, mentioned, in, the, ancient, indian, rigveda, atharvaveda, mahabharata, and, buddhist, games, list, there, are, several, biblical, references, to, casting, lots, hebrew, yapp, l, r, l, as, in, psalm, 22, indicating, that, dicing, or, a, related, activity, was, commonplace, when, the, psalm, was, composed, knucklebones, was, a, game, of, skill, played, in, ancient, greece, a, derivative, form, had, the, four, sides, of, bones, receive, different, values, like, modern, dice, although, gambling, was, illegal, many, romans, were, passionate, gamblers, who, enjoyed, dicing, which, was, known, as, aleam, ludere, to, play, at, dice, there, were, two, sizes, of, roman, dice, tali, were, large, dice, inscribed, with, one, three, four, and, six, on, four, sides, tesserae, were, smaller, dice, with, sides, numbered, from, one, to, six, twenty, sided, dice, date, back, to, the, 2nd, century, ce, and, from, ptolemaic, egypt, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, bce, dominoes, and, playing, cards, originated, in, china, as, developments, from, dice, the, transition, from, dice, to, playing, cards, occurred, in, china, around, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ce, and, coincides, with, the, technological, transition, from, rolls, of, manuscripts, to, block, printed, books, in, japan, dice, were, used, to, play, a, popular, game, called, sugoroku, there, are, two, types, of, sugoroku, ban, sugoroku, is, similar, to, backgammon, and, dates, to, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, ce, while, e, sugoroku, is, a, racing, game, dice, are, thrown, onto, a, surface, either, from, the, hand, or, from, a, container, designed, for, this, such, as, a, cup, tray, or, tower, the, face, or, corner, in, cases, such, as, tetrahedral, dice, or, edge, for, odd, numbered, long, dice, of, the, die, that, is, uppermost, when, it, comes, to, rest, provides, the, value, of, the, throw, the, result, of, a, die, roll, is, determined, by, the, way, it, is, thrown, according, to, the, laws, of, classical, mechanics, although, luck, is, often, credited, for, the, results, of, a, roll, a, die, roll, is, made, random, by, uncertainty, in, minor, factors, such, as, tiny, movements, in, the, thrower, s, hand, they, are, thus, a, crude, form, of, hardware, random, number, generator, one, typical, contemporary, dice, game, is, craps, where, two, dice, are, thrown, simultaneously, and, wagers, are, made, on, the, total, value, of, the, two, dice, dice, are, frequently, used, to, introduce, randomness, into, board, games, where, they, are, often, used, to, decide, the, distance, through, which, a, piece, will, move, along, the, board, as, in, backgammon, and, monopoly, common, dice, are, small, cubes, most, often, 1, 6, cm, 0, 63, in, across, whose, faces, are, numbered, from, one, to, six, usually, by, patterns, of, round, dots, called, pips, while, the, use, of, arabic, numerals, is, occasionally, seen, such, dice, are, less, common, opposite, sides, of, a, modern, die, traditionally, add, up, to, seven, requiring, the, 1, 2, and, 3, faces, to, share, a, vertex, the, faces, of, a, die, may, be, placed, clockwise, or, counterclockwise, about, this, vertex, if, the, 1, 2, and, 3, faces, run, counterclockwise, the, die, is, called, right, handed, if, those, faces, run, clockwise, the, die, is, called, left, handed, western, dice, are, normally, right, handed, and, chinese, dice, are, normally, left, handed, the, pips, on, standard, six, sided, dice, are, arranged, in, specific, patterns, as, shown, asian, style, dice, bear, similar, patterns, to, western, ones, but, the, pips, are, closer, to, the, center, of, the, face, in, addition, the, pips, are, differently, sized, on, asian, style, dice, and, the, pips, are, colored, red, on, the, 1, and, 4, sides, red, fours, may, be, of, indian, origin, non, precision, dice, are, manufactured, via, the, plastic, injection, molding, process, often, made, of, polymethyl, methacrylate, pmma, the, pips, or, numbers, on, the, die, are, a, part, of, the, mold, different, pigments, can, be, added, to, the, dice, to, make, them, opaque, or, transparent, or, multiple, pigments, may, be, added, to, make, the, dice, speckled, or, marbled, the, coloring, for, numbering, is, achieved, by, submerging, the, die, entirely, in, paint, which, is, allowed, to, dry, the, die, is, then, polished, via, a, tumble, finishing, process, similar, to, rock, polishing, the, abrasive, agent, scrapes, off, all, of, the, paint, except, for, the, indents, of, the, numbering, a, finer, abrasive, is, then, used, to, polish, the, die, this, process, also, produces, the, smoother, rounded, edges, on, the, dice, precision, casino, dice, may, have, a, polished, or, sand, finish, making, them, transparent, or, translucent, respectively, casino, dice, have, their, pips, drilled, then, filled, flush, with, a, paint, of, the, same, density, as, the, material, used, for, the, dice, such, that, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, dice, is, as, close, to, the, geometric, center, as, possible, this, mitigates, concerns, that, the, pips, will, cause, a, small, bias, all, such, dice, are, stamped, with, a, serial, number, to, prevent, potential, cheaters, from, substituting, a, die, precision, backgammon, dice, are, made, the, same, way, they, tend, to, be, slightly, smaller, and, have, rounded, corners, and, edges, to, allow, better, movement, inside, the, dice, cup, and, stop, forceful, rolls, from, damaging, the, playing, surface, the, word, die, comes, from, old, french, d, from, latin, datum, something, which, is, given, or, played, while, the, terms, ace, deuce, trey, cater, cinque, and, sice, are, generally, obsolete, with, the, names, of, the, numbers, preferred, they, are, still, used, by, some, professional, gamblers, to, designate, different, sides, of, the, dice, ace, is, from, the, latin, as, meaning, a, unit, the, others, are, 2, to, 6, in, old, french, when, rolling, two, dice, certain, combinations, have, slang, names, the, term, snake, eyes, is, a, roll, of, one, pip, on, each, die, the, online, etymology, dictionary, traces, use, of, the, term, as, far, back, as, 1919, the, us, term, boxcars, also, known, as, midnight, is, a, roll, of, six, pips, on, each, die, the, pair, of, six, pips, resembles, a, pair, of, boxcars, on, a, freight, train, many, rolls, have, names, in, the, game, of, craps, using, unicode, characters, the, faces, can, be, shown, in, text, using, the, range, u, 2680, to, u, 2685, or, using, decimal, 9856, to, 9861, and, the, emoji, using, u, 1f3b2, or, 127922, from, the, miscellaneous, symbols, and, pictographs, block, a, loaded, weighted, cheat, or, crooked, die, is, one, that, has, been, tampered, with, so, that, it, will, land, with, a, specific, side, facing, upwards, more, often, or, less, often, than, a, fair, die, would, there, are, several, methods, for, making, loaded, dice, including, rounded, faces, off, square, faces, and, weights, casinos, and, gambling, halls, frequently, use, transparent, cellulose, acetate, dice, as, tampering, is, easier, to, detect, than, with, opaque, dice, various, shapes, such, as, two, sided, or, four, sided, dice, are, documented, in, archaeological, findings, for, example, from, ancient, egypt, and, the, middle, east, while, the, cubical, six, sided, die, became, the, most, common, type, in, many, parts, of, the, world, other, shapes, were, always, known, like, 20, sided, dice, in, ptolemaic, and, roman, times, the, modern, tradition, of, using, sets, of, polyhedral, dice, started, around, the, end, of, the, 1960s, when, non, cubical, dice, became, popular, among, players, of, wargames, and, since, have, been, employed, extensively, in, role, playing, games, and, trading, card, games, dice, using, both, the, numerals, 6, and, 9, which, are, reciprocally, symmetric, through, rotation, typically, distinguish, them, with, a, dot, or, underline, dice, are, often, sold, in, sets, matching, in, color, of, six, different, shapes, five, of, the, dice, are, shaped, like, the, platonic, solids, whose, faces, are, regular, polygons, aside, from, the, cube, the, other, four, platonic, solids, have, 4, 8, 12, and, 20, faces, allowing, for, those, number, ranges, to, be, generated, the, only, other, common, non, cubical, die, is, the, 10, sided, die, a, pentagonal, trapezohedron, die, whose, faces, are, ten, kites, each, with, two, different, edge, lengths, three, different, angles, and, two, different, kinds, of, vertices, such, sets, frequently, include, a, second, 10, sided, die, either, of, contrasting, color, or, numbered, by, tens, allowing, the, pair, of, 10, sided, dice, to, be, combined, to, generate, numbers, between, 1, and, 100, using, these, dice, in, various, ways, games, can, closely, approximate, a, variety, of, probability, distributions, for, instance, 10, sided, dice, can, be, rolled, in, pairs, to, produce, a, uniform, distribution, of, random, percentages, and, summing, the, values, of, multiple, dice, will, produce, approximations, to, normal, distributions, unlike, other, common, dice, a, four, sided, tetrahedral, die, does, not, have, a, side, that, faces, upward, when, it, is, at, rest, on, a, surface, so, it, must, be, read, in, a, different, way, on, some, four, sided, dice, each, face, features, multiple, numbers, with, the, same, number, printed, near, each, vertex, on, all, sides, in, this, case, the, number, around, the, vertex, pointing, up, is, used, alternatively, the, numbers, on, a, tetrahedral, die, can, be, placed, at, the, middle, of, the, edges, in, which, case, the, numbers, around, the, base, are, used, normally, the, faces, on, a, die, will, be, placed, so, opposite, faces, will, add, up, to, one, more, than, the, number, of, faces, this, is, not, possible, with, 4, sided, dice, and, dice, with, an, odd, number, of, faces, some, dice, such, as, those, with, 10, sides, are, usually, numbered, sequentially, beginning, with, 0, in, which, case, the, opposite, faces, will, add, to, one, less, than, the, number, of, faces, some, twenty, sided, dice, have, a, different, arrangement, used, for, the, purpose, of, keeping, track, of, an, integer, that, counts, down, such, as, health, points, these, spindown, dice, are, arranged, such, that, adjacent, integers, appear, on, adjacent, faces, allowing, the, user, to, easily, find, the, next, lower, number, they, are, commonly, used, with, collectible, card, games, uniform, fair, dice, are, dice, where, all, faces, have, an, equal, probability, of, outcome, due, to, the, symmetry, of, the, die, as, it, is, face, transitive, in, addition, to, the, platonic, solids, these, theoretically, include, two, other, types, of, polyhedra, are, technically, not, face, transitive, but, are, still, fair, dice, due, to, symmetry, long, dice, and, teetotums, can, in, principle, be, made, with, any, number, of, faces, including, odd, numbers, long, dice, are, based, on, the, infinite, set, of, prisms, all, the, rectangular, faces, are, mutually, face, transitive, so, they, are, equally, probable, the, two, ends, of, the, prism, may, be, rounded, or, capped, with, a, pyramid, designed, so, that, the, die, cannot, rest, on, those, faces, 4, sided, long, dice, are, easier, to, roll, than, tetrahedra, and, are, used, in, the, traditional, board, games, dayakattai, and, dald, s, the, faces, of, most, dice, are, labelled, using, sequences, of, whole, numbers, usually, starting, at, one, expressed, with, either, pips, or, digits, however, there, are, some, applications, that, require, results, other, than, numbers, examples, include, letters, for, boggle, directions, for, warhammer, fantasy, battle, fudge, dice, playing, card, symbols, for, poker, dice, and, instructions, for, sexual, acts, using, sex, dice, dice, may, have, numbers, that, do, not, form, a, counting, sequence, starting, at, one, one, variation, on, the, standard, die, is, known, as, the, average, die, these, are, six, sided, dice, with, sides, numbered, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, which, have, the, same, arithmetic, mean, as, a, standard, die, 3, 5, for, a, single, die, 7, for, a, pair, of, dice, but, have, a, narrower, range, of, possible, values, 2, through, 5, for, one, 4, through, 10, for, a, pair, they, are, used, in, some, table, top, wargames, where, a, narrower, range, of, numbers, is, required, other, numbered, variations, include, sicherman, dice, and, intransitive, dice, a, die, can, be, constructed, in, the, shape, of, a, sphere, with, the, addition, of, an, internal, cavity, in, the, shape, of, the, dual, polyhedron, of, the, desired, die, shape, and, an, internal, weight, the, weight, will, settle, in, one, of, the, points, of, the, internal, cavity, causing, it, to, settle, with, one, of, the, numbers, uppermost, for, instance, a, sphere, with, an, octahedral, cavity, and, a, small, internal, weight, will, settle, with, one, of, the, 6, points, of, the, cavity, held, downwards, by, the, weight, many, board, games, use, dice, to, randomize, how, far, pieces, move, or, to, settle, conflicts, typically, this, has, meant, that, rolling, higher, numbers, is, better, some, games, such, as, axis, allies, have, inverted, this, system, by, making, the, lower, values, more, potent, in, the, modern, age, a, few, games, and, game, designers, have, approached, dice, in, a, different, way, by, making, each, side, of, the, die, similarly, valuable, in, castles, of, burgundy, players, spend, their, dice, to, take, actions, based, on, the, die, s, value, in, this, game, a, six, is, not, better, than, a, one, or, vice, versa, in, quarriors, and, its, descendant, dicemasters, different, sides, of, the, dice, can, offer, completely, different, abilities, several, sides, often, give, resources, while, others, grant, the, player, useful, actions, dice, can, be, used, for, divination, and, using, dice, for, such, a, purpose, is, called, cleromancy, a, pair, of, common, dice, is, usual, though, other, forms, of, polyhedra, can, be, used, tibetan, buddhists, sometimes, use, this, method, of, divination, it, is, highly, likely, that, the, pythagoreans, used, the, platonic, solids, as, dice, they, referred, to, such, dice, as, the, dice, of, the, gods, and, they, sought, to, understand, the, universe, through, an, understanding, of, geometry, in, polyhedra, polyhedral, dice, are, commonly, used, in, role, playing, games, the, fantasy, role, playing, game, dungeons, dragons, d, d, is, largely, credited, with, popularizing, dice, in, such, games, some, games, use, only, one, type, like, exalted, which, uses, only, ten, sided, dice, others, use, numerous, types, for, different, game, purposes, such, as, d, d, which, makes, use, of, all, common, polyhedral, dice, dice, are, usually, used, to, determine, the, outcome, of, events, games, typically, determine, results, either, as, a, total, on, one, or, more, dice, above, or, below, a, fixed, number, or, a, certain, number, of, rolls, above, a, certain, number, on, one, or, more, dice, due, to, circumstances, or, character, skill, the, initial, roll, may, have, a, number, added, to, or, subtracted, from, the, final, result, or, have, the, player, roll, extra, or, fewer, dice, to, keep, track, of, rolls, easily, dice, notation, is, frequently, used, astrological, dice, are, a, specialized, set, of, three, 12, sided, dice, for, divination, the, first, die, represents, the, planets, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, nodes, of, the, moon, the, second, die, represents, the, 12, zodiac, signs, and, the, third, represents, the, 12, houses, a, specialized, icosahedron, die, provides, the, answers, of, the, magic, 8, ball, conventionally, used, to, provide, answers, to, yes, or, no, questions, dice, can, be, used, to, generate, random, numbers, for, use, in, passwords, and, cryptography, applications, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, describes, a, method, by, which, dice, can, be, used, to, generate, passphrases, diceware, is, a, method, recommended, for, generating, secure, but, memorable, passphrases, by, repeatedly, rolling, five, dice, and, picking, the, corresponding, word, from, a, pre, generated, list, in, many, gaming, contexts, especially, tabletop, role, playing, games, shorthand, notations, representing, different, dice, rolls, are, used, a, very, common, notation, considered, a, standard, expresses, a, dice, roll, as, n, d, s, or, n, d, s, where, n, is, the, number, of, rice, rolled, and, s, is, the, number, of, sides, on, each, die, if, only, one, die, is, rolled, n, is, normally, not, shown, for, example, d4, denotes, one, four, sided, die, 6d8, means, the, player, should, roll, six, eight, sided, dice, and, sum, the, results, the, notation, also, allows, for, adding, or, subtracting, a, constant, amount, c, to, the, roll, when, an, amount, is, added, the, notation, is, n, d, s, c, or, n, d, s, c, for, example, 3d6, 4, instructs, the, player, to, roll, three, six, sided, dice, calculate, the, total, and, add, four, to, it, when, an, amount, is, to, be, subtracted, the, notation, is, n, d, s, c, or, n, d, s, c, so, 3d6, 4, instructs, the, player, to, subtract, four, from, the, result, of, rolling, 3d6, if, the, result, of, a, modified, dice, roll, is, negative, it, is, often, taken, to, be, zero, or, one, for, instance, when, the, dice, roll, determines, the, amount, of, damage, to, a, creature, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, publication, now, in, the, public, domain, chisholm, hugh, ed, 1911, dice, encyclop, dia,
