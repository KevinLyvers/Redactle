childbirth, also, known, as, labour, parturition, and, delivery, is, the, completion, of, pregnancy, where, one, or, more, babies, exits, the, internal, environment, of, the, mother, via, vaginal, delivery, or, caesarean, section, in, 2019, there, were, about, 140, 11, million, human, births, globally, in, the, developed, countries, most, deliveries, occur, in, hospitals, while, in, the, developing, countries, most, are, home, births, the, most, common, childbirth, method, worldwide, is, vaginal, delivery, it, involves, four, stages, of, labour, the, shortening, and, opening, of, the, cervix, during, the, first, stage, descent, and, birth, of, the, baby, during, the, second, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, during, the, third, and, the, recovery, of, the, mother, and, infant, during, the, fourth, stage, which, is, referred, to, as, the, postpartum, the, first, stage, is, characterised, by, abdominal, cramping, or, also, back, pain, in, the, case, of, back, labour, that, typically, lasts, half, a, minute, and, occurs, every, 10, to, 30, minutes, contractions, gradually, become, stronger, and, closer, together, since, the, pain, of, childbirth, correlates, with, contractions, the, pain, becomes, more, frequent, and, strong, as, the, labour, progresses, the, second, stage, ends, when, the, infant, is, fully, expelled, the, third, stage, is, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, the, fourth, stage, of, labour, involves, the, recovery, of, the, mother, delayed, clamping, of, the, umbilical, cord, and, monitoring, of, the, neonate, as, of, 2014, all, major, health, organisations, advise, that, immediately, following, a, live, birth, regardless, of, the, delivery, method, that, the, infant, be, placed, on, the, mother, s, chest, termed, skin, to, skin, contact, and, to, delay, neonate, procedures, for, at, least, one, to, two, hours, or, until, the, baby, has, had, its, first, breastfeeding, vaginal, delivery, is, generally, recommended, as, a, first, option, cesarean, section, can, lead, to, increased, risk, of, complications, and, a, significantly, slower, recovery, there, are, also, many, natural, benefits, of, a, vaginal, delivery, in, both, mother, and, baby, various, methods, may, help, with, pain, such, as, relaxation, techniques, opioids, and, spinal, blocks, it, is, best, practice, to, limit, the, amount, of, interventions, that, occur, during, labour, and, delivery, such, as, an, elective, cesarean, section, however, in, some, cases, a, scheduled, cesarean, section, must, be, planned, for, a, successful, delivery, and, recovery, of, the, mother, an, emergency, cesarean, section, may, be, recommended, if, unexpected, complications, occur, or, little, to, no, progression, through, the, birthing, canal, is, observed, in, a, vaginal, delivery, each, year, complications, from, pregnancy, and, childbirth, result, in, about, 500, 000, birthing, deaths, seven, million, women, have, serious, long, term, problems, and, 50, million, women, giving, birth, have, negative, health, outcomes, following, delivery, most, of, which, occur, in, the, developing, world, complications, in, the, mother, include, obstructed, labour, postpartum, bleeding, eclampsia, and, postpartum, infection, complications, in, the, baby, include, lack, of, oxygen, at, birth, birth, asphyxia, birth, trauma, and, prematurity, the, most, prominent, sign, of, labour, is, strong, repetitive, uterine, contractions, pain, in, contractions, has, been, described, as, feeling, similar, to, very, strong, menstrual, cramps, crowning, may, be, experienced, as, an, intense, stretching, and, burning, the, lamaze, method, of, childbirth, teaches, that, making, noises, such, as, moaning, groaning, grunting, repeating, words, over, and, over, and, any, sound, that, one, s, body, may, wish, to, naturally, make, may, help, to, relieve, pain, and, help, labour, to, progress, according, to, lamaze, while, the, media, would, have, you, believe, that, all, birthing, women, scream, in, reality, it, s, not, the, most, common, noise, they, say, that, screaming, may, be, a, sign, that, the, labouring, woman, is, beginning, to, panic, and, the, support, team, should, help, her, back, to, regulated, breathing, back, labour, is, a, complication, that, occurs, during, childbirth, when, a, fetus, exhibits, posterior, presentation, i, e, when, the, fetus, is, facing, the, mother, s, navel, instead, of, the, typical, anterior, presentation, this, leads, to, more, intense, contractions, and, causes, pain, in, the, lower, back, that, persists, between, contractions, as, the, fetus, occiput, exerts, pressure, on, the, mother, s, sacrum, another, prominent, sign, of, labour, is, the, rupture, of, membranes, commonly, known, as, water, breaking, during, pregnancy, a, baby, is, surrounded, and, cushioned, by, a, fluid, filled, sac, usually, the, sac, ruptures, at, the, beginning, of, or, during, labour, it, may, cause, a, gush, of, fluid, or, leak, in, an, intermittent, or, constant, flow, of, small, amounts, from, a, woman, s, vagina, the, fluid, is, clear, or, pale, yellow, if, the, amniotic, sac, has, not, yet, broken, during, labour, the, health, care, provider, may, break, it, in, a, technique, called, an, amniotomy, in, an, amniotomy, a, thin, plastic, hook, is, used, to, make, a, small, opening, in, the, sac, causing, the, water, to, break, if, the, sac, breaks, before, labour, starts, it, s, called, a, prelabour, rupture, of, membranes, contractions, will, typically, start, within, 24, hours, after, the, water, breaks, if, not, the, care, provider, will, generally, begin, labour, induction, within, 24, to, 48, hours, if, the, baby, is, preterm, less, than, 37, weeks, of, pregnancy, the, healthcare, provider, may, use, a, medication, to, delay, delivery, there, is, currently, no, definitive, scientific, explanation, for, why, labour, is, painful, according, to, studies, during, pregnancy, the, myometrium, the, muscle, part, of, the, uterus, is, greatly, denervated, stretch, receptors, in, the, uterus, disappear, during, pregnancy, and, stretch, receptors, in, the, cervix, disappear, at, the, onset, of, labour, consequently, the, reason, for, labour, pain, has, only, been, theorised, not, ascertained, one, theory, is, that, the, pain, results, from, the, buildup, of, chemicals, released, during, physical, exertion, the, second, leading, theory, is, that, the, pain, results, from, the, vasoconstriction, of, uterine, blood, vessels, in, the, myometrium, each, contraction, squeezes, the, blood, vessels, reducing, blood, flow, and, causing, some, hypoxia, during, the, later, stages, of, gestation, there, is, an, increase, in, abundance, of, oxytocin, a, hormone, that, is, known, to, evoke, feelings, of, contentment, reductions, in, anxiety, and, feelings, of, calmness, and, security, around, the, mate, oxytocin, is, further, released, during, labour, when, the, fetus, stimulates, the, cervix, and, vagina, and, it, is, believed, that, it, plays, a, major, role, in, the, bonding, of, a, mother, to, her, infant, and, in, the, establishment, of, maternal, behaviour, studies, show, that, the, father, of, the, child, also, has, an, increase, in, oxytocin, levels, following, contact, with, the, infant, and, parents, with, higher, oxytocin, levels, showed, more, responsiveness, and, synchrony, in, their, interactions, with, their, infant, the, act, of, nursing, a, child, also, causes, a, release, of, oxytocin, to, help, the, baby, get, milk, more, easily, from, the, nipple, station, refers, to, the, relationship, of, the, fetal, presenting, part, to, the, level, of, the, ischial, spines, when, the, presenting, part, is, at, the, ischial, spines, the, station, is, 0, synonymous, with, engagement, if, the, presenting, fetal, part, is, above, the, spines, the, distance, is, measured, and, described, as, minus, stations, which, range, from, 1, to, 4, cm, if, the, presenting, part, is, below, the, ischial, spines, the, distance, is, stated, as, plus, stations, 1, to, 4, cm, at, 3, and, 4, the, presenting, part, is, at, the, perineum, and, can, be, seen, the, fetal, head, may, temporarily, change, shape, becoming, more, elongated, or, cone, shaped, as, it, moves, through, the, birth, canal, this, change, in, the, shape, of, the, fetal, head, is, called, molding, and, is, much, more, prominent, in, women, having, their, first, vaginal, delivery, cervical, ripening, is, the, physical, and, chemical, changes, in, the, cervix, to, prepare, it, for, the, stretching, that, will, take, place, as, the, fetus, moves, out, of, the, uterus, and, into, the, birth, canal, a, scoring, system, called, a, bishop, score, can, be, used, to, judge, the, degree, of, cervical, ripening, to, predict, the, timing, of, labour, and, delivery, of, the, infant, or, for, women, at, risk, for, preterm, labour, it, is, also, used, to, judge, when, a, woman, will, respond, to, induction, of, labour, for, a, postdate, pregnancy, or, other, medical, reasons, there, are, several, methods, of, inducing, cervical, ripening, which, will, allow, the, uterine, contractions, to, effectively, dilate, the, cervix, vaginal, delivery, involves, four, stages, of, labour, the, shortening, and, opening, of, the, cervix, during, the, first, stage, descent, and, birth, of, the, baby, during, the, second, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, during, the, third, and, the, 4th, stage, of, recovery, which, lasts, until, two, hours, after, the, delivery, the, first, stage, is, characterised, by, abdominal, cramping, or, back, pain, that, typically, lasts, around, half, a, minute, and, occurs, every, 10, to, 30, minutes, the, contractions, and, pain, gradually, becomes, stronger, and, closer, together, the, second, stage, ends, when, the, infant, is, fully, expelled, in, the, third, stage, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, the, fourth, stage, of, labour, involves, recovery, the, uterus, beginning, to, contract, to, pre, pregnancy, state, delayed, clamping, of, the, umbilical, cord, and, monitoring, of, the, neonatal, tone, and, vitals, as, of, 2014, all, major, health, organisations, advise, that, immediately, following, a, live, birth, regardless, of, the, delivery, method, that, the, infant, be, placed, on, the, mother, s, chest, termed, skin, to, skin, contact, and, delaying, routine, procedures, for, at, least, one, to, two, hours, or, until, the, baby, has, had, its, first, breastfeeding, definitions, of, the, onset, of, labour, include, many, women, are, known, to, experience, what, has, been, termed, the, nesting, instinct, women, report, a, spurt, of, energy, shortly, before, going, into, labour, common, signs, that, labour, is, about, to, begin, may, include, what, is, known, as, lightening, which, is, the, process, of, the, baby, moving, down, from, the, rib, cage, with, the, head, of, the, baby, engaging, deep, in, the, pelvis, the, pregnant, woman, may, then, find, breathing, easier, since, her, lungs, have, more, room, for, expansion, but, pressure, on, her, bladder, may, cause, more, frequent, need, to, void, urinate, lightening, may, occur, a, few, weeks, or, a, few, hours, before, labour, begins, or, even, not, until, labour, has, begun, some, women, also, experience, an, increase, in, vaginal, discharge, several, days, before, labour, begins, when, the, mucus, plug, a, thick, plug, of, mucus, that, blocks, the, opening, to, the, uterus, is, pushed, out, into, the, vagina, the, mucus, plug, may, become, dislodged, days, before, labour, begins, or, not, until, the, start, of, labour, while, inside, the, uterus, the, baby, is, enclosed, in, a, fluid, filled, membrane, called, the, amniotic, sac, shortly, before, at, the, beginning, of, or, during, labour, the, sac, ruptures, once, the, sac, ruptures, termed, the, water, breaks, the, baby, is, at, risk, for, infection, and, the, mother, s, medical, team, will, assess, the, need, to, induce, labour, if, it, has, not, started, within, the, time, they, believe, to, be, safe, for, the, infant, the, first, stage, of, labour, is, divided, into, latent, and, active, phases, where, the, latent, phase, is, sometimes, included, in, the, definition, of, labour, and, sometimes, not, the, latent, phase, is, generally, defined, as, beginning, at, the, point, at, which, the, woman, perceives, regular, uterine, contractions, in, contrast, braxton, hicks, contractions, which, are, contractions, that, may, start, around, 26, weeks, gestation, and, are, sometimes, called, false, labour, are, infrequent, irregular, and, involve, only, mild, cramping, braxton, hicks, contractions, are, the, uterine, muscles, preparing, to, deliver, the, infant, cervical, effacement, which, is, the, thinning, and, stretching, of, the, cervix, and, cervical, dilation, occur, during, the, closing, weeks, of, pregnancy, effacement, is, usually, complete, or, near, complete, and, dilation, is, about, 5, cm, by, the, end, of, the, latent, phase, the, degree, of, cervical, effacement, and, dilation, may, be, felt, during, a, vaginal, examination, the, active, phase, of, labour, has, geographically, differing, definitions, the, world, health, organization, describes, the, active, first, stage, as, a, period, of, time, characterised, by, regular, painful, uterine, contractions, a, substantial, degree, of, cervical, effacement, and, more, rapid, cervical, dilatation, from, 5, cm, until, full, dilatation, for, first, and, subsequent, labours, in, the, us, the, definition, of, active, labour, was, changed, from, 3, to, 4, cm, to, 5, cm, of, cervical, dilation, for, multiparous, women, mothers, who, had, given, birth, previously, and, at, 6, cm, for, nulliparous, women, those, who, had, not, given, birth, before, this, was, done, in, an, effort, to, increase, the, rates, of, vaginal, delivery, health, care, providers, may, assess, the, mother, s, progress, in, labour, by, performing, a, cervical, exam, to, evaluate, the, cervical, dilation, effacement, and, station, these, factors, form, the, bishop, score, the, bishop, score, can, also, be, used, as, a, means, to, predict, the, success, of, an, induction, of, labour, during, effacement, the, cervix, becomes, incorporated, into, the, lower, segment, of, the, uterus, during, a, contraction, uterine, muscles, contract, causing, shortening, of, the, upper, segment, and, drawing, upwards, of, the, lower, segment, in, a, gradual, expulsive, motion, the, presenting, fetal, part, then, is, permitted, to, descend, full, dilation, is, reached, when, the, cervix, has, widened, enough, to, allow, passage, of, the, baby, s, head, around, 10, cm, dilation, for, a, term, baby, a, standard, duration, of, the, latent, first, stage, has, not, been, established, and, can, vary, widely, from, one, woman, to, another, however, the, duration, of, active, first, stage, from, 5, cm, until, full, cervical, dilatation, usually, does, not, extend, beyond, 12, hours, in, the, first, labour, primiparae, and, usually, does, not, extend, beyond, 10, hours, in, subsequent, labours, multiparae, dystocia, of, labour, also, called, dysfunctional, labour, or, failure, to, progress, is, difficult, labour, or, abnormally, slow, progress, of, labour, involving, progressive, cervical, dilatation, or, lack, of, descent, of, the, fetus, friedman, s, curve, developed, in, 1955, was, for, many, years, used, to, determine, labour, dystocia, however, more, recent, medical, research, suggests, that, the, friedman, curve, may, not, be, currently, applicable, the, expulsion, stage, begins, when, the, cervix, is, fully, dilated, and, ends, when, the, baby, is, born, as, pressure, on, the, cervix, increases, a, sensation, of, pelvic, pressure, is, experienced, and, with, it, an, urge, to, begin, pushing, at, the, beginning, of, the, normal, second, stage, the, head, is, fully, engaged, in, the, pelvis, the, widest, diameter, of, the, head, has, passed, below, the, level, of, the, pelvic, inlet, the, fetal, head, then, continues, descent, into, the, pelvis, below, the, pubic, arch, and, out, through, the, vaginal, opening, this, is, assisted, by, the, additional, maternal, efforts, of, pushing, or, bearing, down, similar, to, defecation, the, appearance, of, the, fetal, head, at, the, vaginal, opening, is, termed, crowning, at, this, point, the, mother, will, feel, an, intense, burning, or, stinging, sensation, when, the, amniotic, sac, has, not, ruptured, during, labour, or, pushing, the, infant, can, be, born, with, the, membranes, intact, this, is, referred, to, as, delivery, en, caul, complete, expulsion, of, the, baby, signals, the, successful, completion, of, the, second, stage, of, labour, some, babies, especially, preterm, infants, are, born, covered, with, a, waxy, or, cheese, like, white, substance, called, vernix, it, is, thought, to, have, some, protective, roles, during, fetal, development, and, for, a, few, hours, after, birth, the, second, stage, varies, from, one, woman, to, another, in, first, labours, birth, is, usually, completed, within, three, hours, whereas, in, subsequent, labours, birth, is, usually, completed, within, two, hours, second, stage, labours, longer, than, three, hours, are, associated, with, declining, rates, of, spontaneous, vaginal, delivery, and, increasing, rates, of, infection, perineal, tears, and, obstetric, haemorrhage, as, well, as, the, need, for, intensive, care, of, the, neonate, the, period, from, just, after, the, fetus, is, expelled, until, just, after, the, placenta, is, expelled, is, called, the, third, stage, of, labour, or, the, involution, stage, placental, expulsion, begins, as, a, physiological, separation, from, the, wall, of, the, uterus, the, average, time, from, delivery, of, the, baby, until, complete, expulsion, of, the, placenta, is, estimated, to, be, 10, 12, minutes, dependent, on, whether, active, or, expectant, management, is, employed, in, as, many, as, 3, of, all, vaginal, deliveries, the, duration, of, the, third, stage, is, longer, than, 30, minutes, and, raises, concern, for, retained, placenta, placental, expulsion, can, be, managed, actively, or, it, can, be, managed, expectantly, allowing, the, placenta, to, be, expelled, without, medical, assistance, active, management, is, the, administration, of, a, uterotonic, drug, within, one, minute, of, fetal, delivery, controlled, traction, of, the, umbilical, cord, and, fundal, massage, after, delivery, of, the, placenta, followed, by, performance, of, uterine, massage, every, 15, minutes, for, two, hours, in, a, joint, statement, world, health, organization, the, international, federation, of, gynaecology, and, obstetrics, and, the, international, confederation, of, midwives, recommend, active, management, of, the, third, stage, of, labour, in, all, vaginal, deliveries, to, help, to, prevent, postpartum, haemorrhage, delaying, the, clamping, of, the, umbilical, cord, for, at, least, one, minute, or, until, it, ceases, to, pulsate, which, may, take, several, minutes, improves, outcomes, as, long, as, there, is, the, ability, to, treat, jaundice, if, it, occurs, for, many, years, it, was, believed, that, late, cord, cutting, led, to, a, mother, s, risk, of, experiencing, significant, bleeding, after, giving, birth, called, postpartum, bleeding, however, a, recent, review, found, that, delayed, cord, cutting, in, healthy, full, term, infants, resulted, in, early, haemoglobin, concentration, and, higher, birthweight, and, increased, iron, reserves, up, to, six, months, after, birth, with, no, change, in, the, rate, of, postpartum, bleeding, the, fourth, stage, of, labour, is, the, period, beginning, immediately, after, childbirth, and, extends, for, about, six, weeks, the, terms, postpartum, and, postnatal, are, often, used, for, this, period, the, woman, s, body, including, hormone, levels, and, uterus, size, return, to, a, non, pregnant, state, and, the, newborn, adjusts, to, life, outside, the, mother, s, body, the, world, health, organization, who, describes, the, postnatal, period, as, the, most, critical, and, yet, the, most, neglected, phase, in, the, lives, of, mothers, and, babies, most, deaths, occur, during, the, postnatal, period, following, the, birth, if, the, mother, had, an, episiotomy, or, a, tearing, of, the, perineum, it, is, stitched, this, is, also, an, optimal, time, for, uptake, of, long, acting, reversible, contraception, larc, such, as, the, contraceptive, implant, or, intrauterine, device, iud, both, of, which, can, be, inserted, immediately, after, delivery, while, the, woman, is, still, in, the, delivery, room, the, mother, has, regular, assessments, for, uterine, contraction, and, fundal, height, vaginal, bleeding, heart, rate, and, blood, pressure, and, temperature, for, the, first, 24, hours, after, birth, some, women, may, experience, an, uncontrolled, episode, of, shivering, or, postpartum, chills, following, the, birth, the, first, passing, of, urine, should, be, documented, within, six, hours, afterpains, pains, similar, to, menstrual, cramps, contractions, of, the, uterus, to, prevent, excessive, blood, flow, continue, for, several, days, vaginal, discharge, termed, lochia, can, be, expected, to, continue, for, several, weeks, initially, bright, red, it, gradually, becomes, pink, changing, to, brown, and, finally, to, yellow, or, white, at, one, time, babies, born, in, hospitals, were, removed, from, their, mothers, shortly, after, birth, and, brought, to, the, mother, only, at, feeding, times, mothers, were, told, that, their, newborns, would, be, safer, in, the, nursery, and, that, the, separation, would, offer, the, mothers, more, time, to, rest, as, attitudes, began, to, change, some, hospitals, offered, a, rooming, in, option, wherein, after, a, period, of, routine, hospital, procedures, and, observation, the, infant, could, be, allowed, to, share, the, mother, s, room, as, of, 2020, rooming, in, has, increasingly, become, standard, practice, in, maternity, wards, skin, to, skin, contact, ssc, sometimes, also, called, kangaroo, care, is, a, technique, of, newborn, care, where, babies, are, kept, chest, to, chest, and, skin, to, skin, with, a, parent, typically, their, mother, or, possibly, the, father, this, means, without, the, shirt, or, undergarments, on, the, chest, of, both, the, baby, and, parent, a, 2011, medical, review, found, that, early, skin, to, skin, contact, resulted, in, a, decrease, in, infant, crying, improved, cardio, respiratory, stability, and, blood, glucose, levels, and, improved, breastfeeding, duration, a, 2016, cochrane, review, also, found, that, ssc, at, birth, promotes, the, likelihood, and, effectiveness, of, breastfeeding, as, of, 2014, early, postpartum, ssc, is, endorsed, by, all, major, organisations, that, are, responsible, for, the, well, being, of, infants, including, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, the, world, health, organization, who, states, that, the, process, of, childbirth, is, not, finished, until, the, baby, has, safely, transferred, from, placental, to, mammary, nutrition, it, is, advised, that, the, newborn, be, placed, skin, to, skin, with, the, mother, following, vaginal, birth, or, as, soon, as, the, mother, is, alert, and, responsive, after, a, caesarean, section, postponing, any, routine, procedures, for, at, least, one, to, two, hours, the, baby, s, father, or, other, support, person, may, also, choose, to, hold, the, baby, ssc, until, the, mother, recovers, from, the, anaesthetic, the, who, suggests, that, any, initial, observations, of, the, infant, can, be, done, while, the, infant, remains, close, to, the, mother, saying, that, even, a, brief, separation, before, the, baby, has, had, its, first, feed, can, disturb, the, bonding, process, they, further, advise, frequent, skin, to, skin, contact, as, much, as, possible, during, the, first, days, after, delivery, especially, if, it, were, interrupted, for, some, reason, after, the, delivery, la, leche, league, advises, women, to, have, a, delivery, team, which, includes, a, support, person, who, will, advocate, to, assure, that, it, has, long, been, known, that, a, mother, s, level, of, the, hormone, oxytocin, elevates, in, a, mother, when, she, interacts, with, her, infant, in, 2019, a, large, review, of, the, effects, of, oxytocin, found, that, the, oxytocin, level, in, fathers, that, engage, in, ssc, is, increased, as, well, two, studies, found, that, when, the, infant, is, clothed, only, in, a, diaper, and, placed, in, between, the, mother, or, father, s, breasts, chest, to, chest, shown, to, reduce, stress, and, anxiety, in, parents, after, interaction, for, births, that, occur, in, hospitals, the, who, recommends, a, hospital, stay, of, at, least, 24, hours, following, an, uncomplicated, vaginal, delivery, and, 96, hours, for, a, cesarean, section, looking, at, length, of, stay, in, 2016, for, an, uncomplicated, delivery, around, the, world, shows, an, average, of, less, than, 1, day, in, egypt, to, 6, days, in, pre, war, ukraine, averages, for, australia, are, 2, 8, days, and, 1, 5, days, in, the, uk, while, this, number, is, low, two, thirds, of, women, in, the, uk, have, midwife, assisted, births, and, in, some, cases, the, mother, may, choose, a, hospital, setting, for, birth, to, be, closer, to, the, wide, range, of, assistance, available, for, an, emergency, situation, however, women, with, midwife, care, may, leave, the, hospital, shortly, after, birth, and, her, midwife, will, continue, her, care, at, her, home, in, the, u, s, the, average, length, of, stay, has, gradually, dropped, from, 4, 1, days, in, 1970, to, a, current, stay, of, 2, days, the, cdc, attributed, the, drop, to, the, rise, in, health, care, costs, saying, people, could, not, afford, to, stay, in, the, hospital, any, longer, to, keep, it, from, dropping, any, lower, in, 1996,

frequency, childbirth, is, achieved, through, labour, induction, or, caesarean, section, also, called, a, c, section, labour, induction, is, the, process, or, treatment, that, stimulates, childbirth, and, delivery, inducing, labour, can, be, accomplished, with, pharmaceutical, or, non, pharmaceutical, methods, inductions, are, most, often, performed, either, with, prostaglandin, drug, treatment, alone, or, with, a, combination, of, prostaglandin, and, intravenous, oxytocin, treatment, caesarean, section, is, the, removal, of, the, neonate, through, a, surgical, incision, in, the, abdomen, rather, than, through, vaginal, birth, during, the, procedure, the, patient, is, usually, numbed, with, an, epidural, or, a, spinal, block, but, general, anaesthesia, can, be, used, as, well, a, cut, is, made, in, the, patient, s, abdomen, and, then, in, the, uterus, to, remove, the, baby, before, the, 1970s, once, a, patient, delivered, one, baby, via, c, section, it, was, recommended, that, all, of, her, future, babies, be, delivered, by, c, section, but, that, recommendation, has, changed, unless, there, is, some, other, indication, mothers, can, attempt, a, trial, of, labour, and, most, are, able, to, have, a, vaginal, birth, after, c, section, vbac, induced, births, and, elective, cesarean, before, 39, weeks, can, be, harmful, to, the, neonate, as, well, as, harmful, or, without, benefit, to, the, mother, therefore, many, guidelines, recommend, against, non, medically, required, induced, births, and, elective, cesarean, before, 39, weeks, the, 2012, rate, of, labour, induction, in, the, united, states, was, 23, 3, and, had, more, than, doubled, from, 1990, to, 2010, by, 2022, it, had, climbed, to, 32, the, american, congress, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, acog, guidelines, recommend, a, full, evaluation, of, the, maternal, fetal, status, the, status, of, the, cervix, and, at, least, a, 39, completed, weeks, full, term, of, gestation, for, optimal, health, of, the, newborn, when, considering, elective, induction, of, labour, per, these, guidelines, indications, for, induction, may, include, induction, is, also, considered, for, logistical, reasons, such, as, the, distance, from, hospital, or, psychosocial, conditions, but, in, these, instances, gestational, age, confirmation, must, be, done, and, the, maturity, of, the, fetal, lung, must, be, confirmed, by, testing, the, acog, also, note, that, contraindications, for, induced, labour, are, the, same, as, for, spontaneous, vaginal, delivery, including, vasa, previa, complete, placenta, praevia, umbilical, cord, prolapse, or, active, genital, herpes, simplex, infection, in, which, cases, a, cesarean, section, is, the, safest, delivery, method, the, who, recommends, a, c, section, rate, of, between, 10, and, 15, because, c, sections, rates, higher, than, 10, are, not, associated, with, a, decrease, in, morbidity, and, mortality, in, 2018, a, group, of, medical, professionals, called, the, rates, of, increase, around, the, world, alarming, in, a, lancet, report, c, sections, were, found, to, have, more, than, tripled, from, about, 6, of, all, births, to, 21, in, a, statement, by, the, maternal, and, child, health, organisation, the, march, of, dimes, the, increase, is, largely, due, to, an, increase, of, elective, c, sections, rather, than, when, it, is, really, necessary, or, indicated, looking, at, the, c, section, rates, between, 1976, and, 1996, one, large, study, done, in, the, u, s, found, that, the, proportion, of, pregnancies, delivered, by, c, section, increased, from, 6, 7, in, 1976, to, 14, 2, in, 1996, with, maternal, choice, the, most, frequent, reason, given, by, 2018, the, rate, had, climbed, to, one, third, of, all, births, obstetric, care, frequently, subjects, women, to, institutional, routines, which, may, have, adverse, effects, on, the, progress, of, labour, supportive, care, during, labour, may, involve, emotional, support, comfort, measures, and, information, and, advocacy, which, may, promote, the, physical, process, of, labour, as, well, as, women, s, feelings, of, control, and, competence, thus, reducing, the, need, for, obstetric, intervention, the, continuous, support, may, be, provided, either, by, hospital, staff, such, as, nurses, or, midwives, doulas, or, by, companions, of, the, woman, s, choice, from, her, social, network, there, is, increasing, evidence, to, show, that, the, participation, of, the, child, s, father, in, the, birth, leads, to, a, better, birth, and, also, post, birth, outcomes, providing, the, father, does, not, exhibit, excessive, anxiety, continuous, labour, support, may, help, women, to, give, birth, spontaneously, that, is, without, caesarean, or, vacuum, or, forceps, with, slightly, shorter, labours, and, to, have, more, positive, feelings, regarding, their, experience, of, giving, birth, continuous, labour, support, may, also, reduce, women, s, use, of, pain, medication, during, labour, and, reduce, the, risk, of, babies, having, low, five, minute, apgar, scores, eating, or, drinking, during, labour, is, an, area, of, ongoing, debate, while, some, have, argued, that, eating, in, labour, has, no, harmful, effects, on, outcomes, others, continue, to, have, concern, regarding, the, increased, possibility, of, an, aspiration, event, choking, on, recently, eaten, foods, in, the, event, of, an, emergency, delivery, due, to, the, increased, relaxation, of, the, oesophagus, in, pregnancy, upward, pressure, of, the, uterus, on, the, stomach, and, the, possibility, of, general, anaesthetic, in, the, event, of, an, emergency, cesarean, a, 2013, cochrane, review, found, that, with, good, obstetrical, anaesthesia, there, is, no, change, in, harms, from, allowing, eating, and, drinking, during, labour, in, those, who, are, unlikely, to, need, surgery, they, additionally, acknowledge, that, not, eating, does, not, mean, there, is, an, empty, stomach, or, that, its, contents, are, not, as, acidic, they, therefore, conclude, that, women, should, be, free, to, eat, and, drink, in, labour, or, not, as, they, wish, at, one, time, shaving, of, the, area, around, the, vagina, was, common, practice, due, to, the, belief, that, hair, removal, reduced, the, risk, of, infection, made, an, episiotomy, a, surgical, cut, to, enlarge, the, vaginal, entrance, easier, and, helped, with, instrumental, deliveries, it, is, currently, less, common, though, it, is, still, a, routine, procedure, in, some, countries, even, though, a, systematic, review, found, no, evidence, to, recommend, shaving, side, effects, appear, later, including, irritation, redness, and, multiple, superficial, scratches, from, the, razor, another, effort, to, prevent, infection, has, been, the, use, of, the, antiseptic, chlorhexidine, or, providone, iodine, solution, in, the, vagina, evidence, of, benefit, with, chlorhexidine, is, lacking, a, decreased, risk, is, found, with, providone, iodine, when, a, cesarean, section, is, to, be, performed, an, assisted, delivery, is, used, in, about, 1, in, 8, births, and, may, be, needed, if, either, mother, or, infant, appears, to, be, at, risk, during, a, vaginal, delivery, the, methods, used, are, termed, obstetrical, forceps, extraction, and, vacuum, extraction, also, called, ventouse, extraction, done, properly, they, are, both, safe, with, some, preference, for, forceps, rather, than, vacuum, and, both, are, seen, as, preferable, to, an, unexpected, c, section, while, considered, safe, some, risks, for, the, mother, include, vaginal, tearing, including, a, higher, chance, of, having, a, more, major, vaginal, tear, that, involves, the, muscle, or, wall, of, the, anus, or, rectum, for, women, undergoing, operative, vaginal, delivery, with, vacuum, extraction, or, forceps, there, is, strong, evidence, that, prophylactic, antibiotics, help, to, reduce, the, risk, of, infection, there, is, a, higher, risk, of, blood, clots, forming, in, the, legs, or, pelvis, anti, clot, stockings, or, medication, may, be, ordered, to, avoid, clots, urinary, incontinence, is, not, unusual, after, childbirth, but,

requirement, for, neonatal, resuscitation, and, neonatal, admission, to, intensive, care, however, there, is, a, higher, chance, of, cord, avulsion, most, women, like, to, have, someone, to, support, them, during, labour, and, birth, such, as, a, midwife, nurse, or, doula, or, a, lay, person, such, as, the, father, of, the, baby, a, family, member, or, a, close, friend, studies, have, found, that, continuous, support, during, labour, and, delivery, reduce, the, need, for, medication, and, a, caesarean, or, operative, vaginal, delivery, and, result, in, an, improved, apgar, score, for, the, infant, different, measures, for, pain, control, have, varying, degrees, of, success, and, side, effects, to, the, woman, and, her, baby, in, some, countries, of, europe, doctors, commonly, prescribe, inhaled, nitrous, oxide, gas, for, pain, control, especially, as, 53, nitrous, oxide, 47, oxygen, known, as, entonox, in, the, uk, midwives, may, use, this, gas, without, a, doctor, s, prescription, opioids, such, as, fentanyl, may, be, used, but, if, given, too, close, to, birth, there, is, a, risk, of, respiratory, depression, in, the, infant, popular, medical, pain, control, in, hospitals, include, the, regional, anaesthetics, epidurals, eda, and, spinal, anaesthesia, epidural, analgesia, is, a, generally, safe, and, effective, method, of, relieving, pain, in, labour, but, has, been, associated, with, longer, labour, more, operative, intervention, particularly, instrument, delivery, and, increases, in, cost, however, a, more, recent, 2017, cochrane, review, suggests, that, the,

however, most, subsequent, pregnancies, do, not, have, similar, problems, worldwide, in, 2019, there, were, about, 2, million, stillbirths, that, occurred, after, 28, weeks, of, pregnancy, this, equates, to, 1, in, 72, total, births, or, one, every, 16, seconds, still, births, are, more, common, in, south, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, stillbirth, rates, have, declined, though, more, slowly, since, the, 2000s, preterm, birth, is, the, birth, of, an, infant, at, fewer, than, 37, weeks, gestational, age, globally, about, 15, million, infants, were, born, before, 37, weeks, of, gestation, premature, birth, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, children, under, five, years, of, age, though, many, that, survive, experience, disabilities, including, learning, defects, and, visual, and, hearing, problems, causes, for, early, birth, may, be, unknown, or, may, be, related, to, certain, chronic, conditions, such, as, diabetes, infections, and, other, known, causes, the, world, health, organization, has, developed, guidelines, with, recommendations, to, improve, the, chances, of, survival, and, health, outcomes, for, preterm, infants, if, a, pregnant, woman, enters, preterm, labour, delivery, can, be, delayed, by, giving, medications, called, tocolytics, tocolytics, delay, labour, by, inhibiting, contractions, of, the, uterine, muscles, that, progress, labour, the, most, widely, used, tocolytics, include, beta, agonists, calcium, channel, blockers, and, magnesium, sulfate, the, goal, of, administering, tocolytics, is, not, to, delay, delivery, to, the, point, that, the, child, can, be, delivered, at, term, but, instead, to, postponing, delivery, long, enough, for, the, administration, of, glucocorticoids, which, can, help, the, fetal, lungs, to, mature, enough, to, reduce, morbidity, and, mortality, from, infant, respiratory, distress, syndrome, the, term, postterm, pregnancy, is, used, to, describe, a, condition, in, which, a, woman, has, not, yet, delivered, her, baby, after, 42, weeks, of, gestation, two, weeks, beyond, the, usual, 40, week, duration, of, pregnancy, postmature, births, carry, risks, for, both, the, mother, and, the, baby, including, meconium, aspiration, syndrome, fetal, malnutrition, and, stillbirths, the, placenta, which, supplies, the, baby, with, oxygen, and, nutrients, begins, to, age, and, will, eventually, fail, after, the, 42nd, week, of, gestation, induced, labour, is, indicated, for, postterm, pregnancy, newborns, are, prone, to, infection, in, the, first, month, of, life, the, pathogenic, bacterium, streptococcus, agalactiae, a, group, b, streptococcus, is, most, often, the, cause, of, these, occasionally, fatal, infections, the, baby, contracts, the, infection, from, the, mother, during, labour, in, 2014, it, was, estimated, that, about, one, in, 2000, newborn, babies, had, a, group, b, streptococcuss, infection, within, the, first, week, of, life, usually, evident, as, respiratory, disease, general, sepsis, or, meningitis, untreated, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, are, associated, with, birth, defects, and, infections, in, newborn, babies, particularly, in, the, areas, where, rates, of, infection, remain, high, the, majority, of, stis, have, no, symptoms, or, only, mild, symptoms, that, may, not, be, recognised, mortality, rates, resulting, from, some, infections, may, be, high, for, example, the, overall, perinatal, mortality, rate, associated, with, untreated, syphilis, is, 30, perinatal, asphyxia, is, the, medical, condition, resulting, from, deprivation, of, oxygen, to, a, newborn, infant, that, lasts, long, enough, during, the, birth, process, to, cause, physical, harm, hypoxic, damage, can, also, occur, to, most, of, the, infant, s, organs, heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys, but, brain, damage, is, of, most, concern, and, perhaps, the, least, likely, to, quickly, or, completely, heal, oxygen, deprivation, can, lead, to, permanent, disabilities, in, the, child, such, as, cerebral, palsy, risk, factors, for, fetal, birth, injury, include, fetal, macrosomia, big, baby, maternal, obesity, the, need, for, instrumental, delivery, and, an, inexperienced, attendant, specific, situations, that, can, contribute, to, birth, injury, include, breech, presentation, and, shoulder, dystocia, most, fetal, birth, injuries, resolve, without, long, term, harm, but, brachial, plexus, injury, may, lead, to, erb, s, palsy, or, klumpke, s, paralysis, historically, women, have, been, attended, and, supported, by, other, women, during, labour, and, birth, midwife, training, in, european, cities, began, in, the, 1400s, but, rural, women, were, usually, assisted, by, female, family, or, friends, however, it, was, not, simply, a, ladies, social, bonding, event, as, some, historians, have, portrayed, fear, and, pain, often, filled, the, atmosphere, as, death, during, childbirth, was, a, common, occurrence, in, the, united, states, before, the, 1950s, a, father, would, not, be, in, the, birthing, room, it, did, not, matter, if, it, was, a, home, birth, the, father, would, be, waiting, downstairs, or, in, another, room, in, the, home, if, it, was, in, a, hospital, then, the, father, would, wait, in, the, waiting, room, fathers, were, only, permitted, in, the, room, if, the, life, of, the, mother, or, baby, was, severely, at, risk, in, 1522, a, german, physician, was, sentenced, to, death, for, sneaking, into, a, delivery, room, dressed, as, a, woman, the, majority, of, guidebooks, related, to, pregnancy, and, childbirth, were, written, by, men, who, had, never, been, involved, in, the, birthing, process, a, greek, physician, soranus, of, ephesus, wrote, a, book, about, obstetrics, and, gynaecology, in, the, second, century, which, was, referenced, for, the, next, thousand, years, the, book, contained, endless, home, remedies, for, pregnancy, and, childbirth, many, of, which, would, be, considered, heinous, by, modern, women, and, medical, professionals, both, preterm, and, full, term, infants, benefit, from, skin, to, skin, contact, sometimes, called, kangaroo, care, immediately, following, birth, and, for, the, first, few, weeks, of, life, some, fathers, have, begun, to, hold, their, newborns, skin, to, skin, the, new, baby, is, familiar, with, the, father, s, voice, and, it, is, believed, that, contact, with, the, father, helps, the, infant, to, stabilise, and, promotes, father, to, infant, bonding, looking, at, recent, studies, a, 2019, review, found, that, the, level, of, oxytocin, was, found, to, increase, not, only, in, mothers, who, had, experienced, early, skin, to, skin, attachment, with, their, infants, but, in, the, fathers, as, well, suggesting, a, neurobiological, connection, if, the, infant, s, mother, had, a, caesarean, birth, the, father, can, hold, their, baby, in, skin, to, skin, contact, while, the, mother, recovers, from, the, anaesthetic, historically, most, women, gave, birth, at, home, without, emergency, medical, care, available, in, the, early, days, of, hospitalisation, for, childbirth, a, 17th, century, maternity, ward, in, paris, was, incredibly, congested, with, up, to, five, pregnant, women, sharing, one, bed, at, this, hospital, one, in, five, women, died, during, the, birthing, process, at, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, giving, birth, at, home, became, more, difficult, due, to, congested, living, spaces, and, dirty, living, conditions, that, drove, urban, and, lower, class, women, to, newly, available, hospitals, while, wealthy, and, middle, class, women, continued, to, labour, at, home, consequently, wealthier, women, experienced, lower, maternal, mortality, rates, than, those, of, a, lower, social, class, throughout, the, 1900s, there, was, an, increasing, availability, of, hospitals, and, more, women, began, going, into, the, hospital, for, labour, and, delivery, in, the, united, states, 5, of, women, gave, birth, in, hospitals, in, 1900, by, 1930, 50, of, all, women, and, 75, of, urban, dwelling, women, delivered, in, hospitals, by, 1960, this, number, increased, to, 96, by, the, 1970s, home, birth, rates, fell, to, approximately, 1, in, the, united, states, the, middle, classes, were, especially, receptive, to, the, medicalisation, of, childbirth, which, promised, a, safer, and, less, painful, labour, accompanied, by, the, shift, from, home, to, hospital, was, the, shift, from, midwife, to, physician, male, physicians, began, to, replace, female, midwives, in, europe, and, the, united, states, in, the, 1700s, the, rise, in, status, and, popularity, of, this, new, position, was, accompanied, by, a, drop, in, status, for, midwives, by, the, 1800s, affluent, families, were, primarily, calling, male, doctors, to, assist, with, their, deliveries, and, female, midwives, were, seen, as, a, resource, for, women, who, could, not, afford, better, care, that, completely, removed, women, from, assisting, in, labour, as, only, men, were, eligible, to, become, doctors, at, the, time, additionally, it, privatised, the, birthing, process, as, family, members, and, friends, were, often, banned, from, the, delivery, room, there, was, opposition, to, the, change, from, both, progressive, feminists, and, religious, conservatives, the, feminists, were, concerned, about, job, security, for, a, role, that, had, traditionally, been, held, by, women, the, conservatives, argued, that, it, was, immoral, for, a, woman, to, be, exposed, in, such, a, way, in, front, of, a, man, for, that, reason, many, male, obstetricians, performed, deliveries, in, dark, rooms, or, with, their, patient, fully, covered, with, a, drape, in, 1991, the, who, launched, a, global, programme, the, baby, friendly, hospital, initiative, bfhi, that, encourages, birthing, centres, and, hospitals, to, institute, procedures, that, encourage, mother, baby, bonding, and, breastfeeding, the, johns, hopkins, hospital, describes, the, process, of, receiving, the, baby, friendly, designation, it, involves, changing, long, standing, policies, protocols, and, behaviors, the, baby, friendly, hospital, initiative, includes, a, very, rigorous, credentialing, process, that, includes, a, two, day, site, visit, where, assessors, evaluate, policies, community, partnerships, and, education, plans, as, well, as, interview, patients, physicians, and, staff, members, every, major, health, organisation, such, as, the, cdc, supports, the, bfhi, as, of, 2019, 28, of, hospitals, in, the, us, have, been, accredited, by, the, who, the, use, of, pain, medication, in, labour, has, been, a, controversial, issue, for, hundreds, of, years, a, scottish, woman, was, burned, at, the, stake, in, 1591, for, requesting, pain, relief, in, the, delivery, of, twins, medication, became, more, acceptable, in, 1852, when, queen, victoria, used, chloroform, as, pain, relief, during, labour, the, use, of, morphine, and, scopolamine, also, known, as, twilight, sleep, was, first, used, in, germany, and, popularised, by, german, physicians, bernard, kronig, and, karl, gauss, this, concoction, offered, minor, pain, relief, but, mostly, allowed, women, to, completely, forget, the, entire, delivery, process, under, twilight, sleep, mothers, were, often, blindfolded, and, restrained, as, they, experienced, the, immense, pain, of, childbirth, the, cocktail, came, with, severe, side, effects, such, as, decreased, uterine, contractions, and, altered, mental, state, additionally, babies, delivered, with, the, use, of, childbirth, drugs, often, experienced, temporarily, ceased, breathing, the, feminist, movement, in, the, united, states, openly, and, actively, supported, the, use, of, twilight, sleep, which, was, introduced, to, the, country, in, 1914, some, physicians, many, of, whom, had, been, using, painkillers, for, the, past, fifty, years, including, opium, cocaine, and, quinine, embraced, the, new, drug, others, were, hesitant, there, are, many, conflicting, stories, of, the, first, successful, cesarean, section, or, c, section, in, which, both, mother, and, baby, survived, it, is, however, known, that, the, procedure, had, been, attempted, for, hundreds, of, years, before, it, became, accepted, in, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, while, forceps, have, gone, through, periods, of, high, popularity, today, they, are, only, used, in, approximately, 10, of, deliveries, the, c, section, has, become, the, more, popular, solution, for, difficult, deliveries, in, 2005, one, third, of, babies, were, born, via, c, section, historically, surgical, delivery, was, a, last, resort, method, of, extracting, a, baby, from, its, deceased, or, dying, mother, but, today, caesarean, delivery, on, maternal, request, is, a, medically, unnecessary, caesarean, section, where, the, infant, is, born, by, a, caesarean, section, requested, by, the, parent, even, though, there, is, not, a, medical, indication, to, have, the, surgery, the, reemergence, of, natural, childbirth, began, in, europe, and, was, adopted, by, some, in, the, us, as, early, as, the, late, 1940s, early, supporters, believed, that, the, drugs, used, during, deliveries, interfered, with, happy, childbirth, and, could, negatively, impact, the, newborn, s, emotional, wellbeing, by, the, 1970s, the, call, for, natural, childbirth, was, spread, nationwide, in, conjunction, with, the, second, wave, of, the, feminist, movement, while, it, is, still, most, common, for, american, women, to, deliver, in, the, hospital, supporters, of, natural, birth, still, widely, exist, especially, in, the, uk, where, midwife, assisted, home, births, have, gained, popularity, the, united, nations, population, fund, estimated, that, 303, 000, women, died, of, pregnancy, or, childbirth, related, causes, in, 2015, these, causes, range, from, severe, bleeding, to, obstructed, labour, for, which, there, are, highly, effective, interventions, as, women, have, gained, access, to, family, planning, and, skilled, birth, attendants, with, backup, emergency, obstetric, care, the, global, maternal, mortality, ratio, has, fallen, from, 385, maternal, deaths, per, 100, 000, live, births, in, 1990, to, 216, deaths, per, 100, 000, live, births, in, 2015, and, it, was, reported, in, 2017, that, many, countries, had, halved, their, maternal, death, rates, in, the, last, 10, years, outcomes, for, mothers, in, childbirth, were, especially, poor, before, antibiotics, were, discovered, in, the, 1930s, because, of, high, rates, of, puerperal, fever, until, germ, theory, was, accepted, in, the, mid, 1800s, it, was, assumed, that, puerperal, fever, was, caused, by, a, variety, of, sources, including, the, leakage, of, breast, milk, into, the, body, and, anxiety, later, it, was, discovered, that, puerperal, fever, was, transmitted, by, the, dirty, hands, and, tools, of, doctors, home, births, facilitated, by, trained, midwives, produced, the, best, outcomes, from, 1880, to, 1930, in, the, us, and, europe, whereas, physician, facilitated, hospital, births, produced, the, worst, the, change, in, trend, of, maternal, mortality, can, be, attributed, with, the, widespread, use, of, antibiotics, along, with, the, progression, of, medical, technology, more, extensive, physician, training, and, less, medical, interference, with, normal, deliveries, since, the, us, began, recording, childbirth, statistics, in, 1915, the, us, has, had, historically, poor, maternal, mortality, rates, in, comparison, to, other, developed, countries, britain, started, recording, maternal, mortality, data, from, 1880, onward, distress, levels, vary, widely, during, pregnancy, as, well, as, during, labour, and, delivery, they, appear, to, be, influenced, by, fear, and, anxiety, levels, experience, with, prior, childbirth, cultural, ideas, of, childbirth, pain, mobility, during, labour, and, the, support, received, during, labour, personal, expectations, the, amount, of, support, from, caregivers, quality, of, the, caregiver, patient, relationship, and, involvement, in, decision, making, are, more, important, in, the, mother, s, overall, satisfaction, with, the, birthing, experience, than, are, other, factors, such, as, age, socioeconomic, status, ethnicity, preparation, physical, environment, pain, immobility, or, medical, interventions, according, to, a, 2013, analysis, commissioned, by, the, new, york, times, and, performed, by, truven, healthcare, analytics, the, cost, of, childbirth, varies, dramatically, by, country, in, the, united, states, the, average, amount, actually, paid, by, insurance, companies, or, other, payers, in, 2012, averaged, 9, 775, for, an, uncomplicated, conventional, delivery, and, 15, 041, for, a, caesarean, birth, a, 2013, study, found, varying, costs, by, facility, for, childbirth, expenses, in, california, varying, from, 3, 296, to, 37, 227, for, a, vaginal, birth, and, from, 8, 312, to, 70, 908, for, a, caesarean, birth, reporting, on, costs, in, 2023, forbes, gave, an, average, cost, of, 18, 865, 14, 768, for, vaginal, and, 26, 280, for, cesarean, which, included, pregnancy, delivery, and, postpartum, care, however, many, factors, determined, the, costs, including, where, the, woman, lived, the, type, of, birth, and, whether, or, not, they, had, insurance, even, with, insurance, average, out, of, the, pocket, expenses, for, a, vaginal, delivery, were, 2, 655, and, 3, 214, for, a, cesarean, birth, variables, which, determined, charges, included, length, of, hospital, stay, which, averaged, 48, hours, for, vaginal, birth, and, 96, hours, for, a, cesarean, there, could, be, charges, for, any, complications, before, or, after, the, birth, for, example, an, induced, labour, costs, more, than, a, spontaneous, birth, babies, that, had, a, difficult, birth, may, need, special, tests, and, monitoring, adding, to, the, costs, of, childbirth, beginning, in, 2014, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, began, recommending, that, many, women, give, birth, at, home, under, the, care, of, a, midwife, rather, than, an, obstetrician, citing, lower, expenses, and, better, healthcare, outcomes, the, median, cost, associated, with, home, birth, was, estimated, to, be, about, 1, 500, vs, about, 2, 500, in, hospital, childbirth, routinely, occurs, in, hospitals, in, many, developed, countries, before, the, 20th, century, and, in, some, countries, to, the, present, day, such, as, the, netherlands, it, has, more, typically, occurred, at, home, in, rural, and, remote, communities, of, many, countries, hospitalised, childbirth, may, not, be, readily, available, or, the, best, option, maternal, evacuation, is, the, predominant, risk, management, method, for, assisting, mothers, in, these, communities, maternal, evacuation, is, the, process, of, relocating, pregnant, women, in, remote, communities, to, deliver, their, babies, in, a, nearby, urban, hospital, setting, this, practice, is, common, in, indigenous, inuit, and, northern, manitoban, communities, in, canada, as, well, as, australian, aboriginal, communities, there, has, been, research, considering, the, negative, effects, of, maternal, evacuation, due, to, a, lack, of, social, support, provided, to, these, women, these, negative, effects, include, an, increase, in, maternal, newborn, complications, and, postpartum, depression, and, decreased, breastfeeding, rates, the, exact, location, in, which, childbirth, takes, place, is, an, important, factor, in, determining, nationality, in, particular, for, birth, aboard, aircraft, and, ships, facilities, for, childbirth, include, different, categories, of, birth, attendants, may, provide, support, and, care, during, pregnancy, and, childbirth, although, there, are, important, differences, across, categories, based, on, professional, training, and, skills, practice, regulations, and, the, nature, of, care, delivered, many, of, these, occupations, are, highly, professionalised, but, other, roles, exist, on, a, less, formal, basis, childbirth, educators, are, instructors, who, aim, to, teach, pregnant, women, and, their, partners, about, the, nature, of, pregnancy, labour, signs, and, stages, techniques, for, giving, birth, breastfeeding, and, newborn, baby, care, training, for, this, role, can, be, found, in, hospital, settings, or, through, independent, certifying, organisations, each, organisation, teaches, its, own, curriculum, and, each, emphasises, different, techniques, the, lamaze, technique, is, one, well, known, example, doulas, are, assistants, who, support, mothers, during, pregnancy, labour, birth, and, postpartum, they, are, not, medical, attendants, rather, they, provide, emotional, support, and, non, medical, pain, relief, for, women, during, labour, like, childbirth, educators, and, other, unlicensed, assistive, personnel, certification, to, become, a, doula, is, not, compulsory, thus, anyone, can, call, themself, a, doula, or, a, childbirth, educator, confinement, nannies, are, individuals, who, are, employed, to, provide, assistance, and, stay, with, the, mothers, at, their, home, after, childbirth, they, are, usually, experienced, mothers, who, took, courses, on, how, to, take, care, of, mothers, and, newborn, babies, midwives, are, autonomous, practitioners, who, provide, basic, and, emergency, health, care, before, during, and, after, pregnancy, and, childbirth, generally, to, women, with, low, risk, pregnancies, midwives, are, trained, to, assist, during, labour, and, birth, either, through, direct, entry, or, nurse, midwifery, education, programmes, jurisdictions, where, midwifery, is, a, regulated, profession, will, typically, have, a, registering, and, disciplinary, body, for, quality, control, such, as, the, american, midwifery, certification, board, in, the, united, states, the, college, of, midwives, of, british, columbia, in, canada, or, the, nursing, and, midwifery, council, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, past, midwifery, played, a, crucial, role, in, childbirth, throughout, most, indigenous, societies, although, western, civilisations, attempted, to, assimilate, their, birthing, technologies, into, certain, indigenous, societies, like, turtle, island, and, get, rid, of, the, midwifery, the, national, aboriginal, council, of, midwives, brought, back, the, cultural, ideas, and, midwifery, that, were, once, associated, with, indigenous, birthing, in, jurisdictions, where, midwifery, is, not, a, regulated, profession, traditional, birth, attendants, also, known, as, traditional, or, lay, midwives, may, assist, women, during, childbirth, although, they, do, not, typically, receive, formal, health, care, education, and, training, medical, doctors, who, practise, in, the, field, of, childbirth, include, categorically, specialised, obstetricians, family, practitioners, and, general, practitioners, whose, training, skills, and, practices, include, obstetrics, and, in, some, contexts, general, surgeons, these, physicians, and, surgeons, variously, provide, care, across, the, whole, spectrum, of, normal, and, abnormal, births, and, pathological, labour, conditions, categorically, specialised, obstetricians, are, qualified, surgeons, so, they, can, undertake, surgical, procedures, relating, to, childbirth, some, family, practitioners, or, general, practitioners, also, perform, obstetrical, surgery, obstetrical, procedures, include, cesarean, sections, episiotomies, and, assisted, delivery, categorical, specialists, in, obstetrics, are, commonly, trained, in, both, obstetrics, and, gynaecology, ob, gyn, and, may, provide, other, medical, and, surgical, gynaecological, care, and, may, incorporate, more, general, well, woman, primary, care, elements, in, their, practices, maternal, fetal, medicine, specialists, are, obstetrician, gynecologists, subspecialised, in, managing, and, treating, high, risk, pregnancy, and, delivery, anaesthetists, or, anaesthetists, are, medical, doctors, who, specialise, in, pain, relief, and, the, use, of, drugs, to, facilitate, surgery, and, other, painful, procedures, they, may, contribute, to, the, care, of, a, woman, in, labour, by, performing, an, epidural, or, by, providing, anaesthesia, often, spinal, anaesthesia, for, cesarean, section, or, forceps, delivery, they, are, experts, in, pain, management, during, childbirth, obstetric, nurses, assist, midwives, doctors, women, and, babies, before, during, and, after, the, birth, process, in, the, hospital, system, they, hold, various, nursing, certifications, and, typically, undergo, additional, obstetric, training, in, addition, to, standard, nursing, training, paramedics, are, healthcare, providers, that, are, able, to, provide, emergency, care, to, both, the, mother, and, infant, during, and, after, delivery, using, a, wide, range, of, medications, and, tools, on, an, ambulance, they, are, capable, of, delivering, babies, but, can, do, very, little, for, infants, that, become, stuck, and, are, unable, to, be, delivered, vaginally, lactation, consultants, assist, the, mother, and, newborn, to, breastfeed, successfully, a, health, visitor, comes, to, see, the,

cultural, values, assumptions, and, practices, of, pregnancy, and, childbirth, vary, across, cultures, for, example, some, maya, women, who, work, in, agricultural, fields, of, some, rural, communities, will, usually, continue, to, work, in, a, similar, function, to, how, they, normally, would, throughout, pregnancy, in, some, cases, working, until, labour, begins, comfort, and, proximity, to, extended, family, and, social, support, systems, may, be, a, childbirth, priority, of, many, communities, in, developing, countries, such, as, the, chillihuani, in, peru, and, the, mayan, town, of, san, pedro, la, laguna, home, births, can, help, women, in, these, cultures, feel, more, comfortable, as, they, are, in, their, own, home, with, their, family, around, them, helping, out, in, different, ways, traditionally, it, has, been, rare, in, these, cultures, for, the, mother, to, lie, down, during, childbirth, opting, instead, for, standing, kneeling, or, walking, around, prior, to, and, during, birthing, some, communities, rely, heavily, on, religion, for, their, birthing, practices, it, is, believed, that, if, certain, acts, are, carried, out, then, it, will, allow,
