activity, sexual, reproduction, safe, sex, and, birth, control, sexual, health, reproductive, health, emotional, relations, and, responsibilities, age, of, consent, and, reproductive, rights, sex, education, that, includes, all, of, these, issues, is, known, as, comprehensive, sexuality, education, in, contrast, abstinence, only, sex, education, which, focuses, solely, on, promoting, sexual, abstinence, is, often, favored, in, more, socially, conservative, regions, including, some, parts, of, the, united, states, sex, education, may, be, provided, as, part, of, school, programs, public, health, campaigns, or, by, parents, or, caregivers, in, some, countries, it, is, known, as, relationships, and, sexual, health, education, many, governments, see, it, as, beneficial, to, provide, public, education, on, such, matters, prior, to, or, at, the, beginning, of, puberty, for, reasons, of, public, health, in, limiting, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, avoiding, teenage, pregnancy, or, unwanted, pregnancies, later, on, in, many, cultures, the, discussion, of, all, sexual, issues, has, traditionally, been, considered, taboo, and, adolescents, were, not, given, any, information, on, sexual, matters, such, instruction, as, was, given, was, traditionally, left, to, a, child, s, parents, and, often, this, was, put, off, until, just, before, their, marriage, however, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, progressive, education, movement, led, to, the, introduction, of, sex, education, as, social, hygiene, in, north, american, school, curricula, and, the, introduction, of, school, based, sex, education, during, the, second, world, war, uk, governmental, concerns, grew, around, mass, relocation, parentless, youths, and, young, men, and, women, working, together, for, the, first, time, not, only, were, there, fears, of, new, sexually, transmitted, diseases, but, there, was, also, growing, anxiety, around, young, pregnancy, putting, pressure, on, the, war, ravaged, economy, and, healthcare, system, as, such, the, uk, board, for, education, introduced, the, sex, education, in, schools, and, youth, organisations, guidance, this, put, the, onus, of, sex, education, on, schools, and, youth, groups, and, guided, leaders, on, how, to, execute, this, for, example, the, mechanics, of, sexual, intercourse, could, be, communicated, via, the, keeping, of, livestock, as, students, could, observe, reproduction, in, real, time, the, guidance, also, encouraged, discussions, about, menstruation, motherhood, courses, and, personal, hygiene, talks, popular, among, teachers, and, many, parents, this, guidance, which, made, sex, education, a, possibility, not, an, obligation, prevailed, for, many, years, in, the, uk, in, the, 1970s, informational, films, became, popular, among, teachers, martin, cole, s, growing, up, 1971, was, a, frank, look, at, how, sex, works, physiologically, and, socially, it, showed, real, clips, of, penises, and, masturbation, which, sparked, some, backlash, however, it, became, apparent, in, the, 1980s, that, a, frank, and, factual, approach, was, required, in, sex, education, as, the, hiv, aids, crisis, began, in, the, uk, in, 1999, the, labour, government, introduced, sex, and, relationships, education, guidance, with, particular, focus, on, sexually, transmitted, diseases, and, teenage, pregnancy, this, was, part, of, the, ten, year, teenage, pregnancy, strategy, which, would, eventually, resolve, in, 2010, teenage, pregnancy, rates, were, halved, across, this, period, however, similar, changes, in, other, countries, indicate, that, this, was, not, an, effect, of, the, strategy, globally, the, outbreak, of, aids, has, given, a, new, sense, of, urgency, to, sex, education, in, many, african, countries, where, aids, is, at, epidemic, levels, see, hiv, aids, in, africa, sex, education, is, seen, by, most, scientists, as, a, vital, public, health, strategy, some, international, organizations, such, as, planned, parenthood, consider, that, broad, sex, education, programs, have, global, benefits, such, as, controlling, the, risk, of, overpopulation, and, the, advancement, of, women, s, rights, see, also, reproductive, rights, the, use, of, mass, media, campaigns, has, sometimes, resulted, in, high, levels, of, awareness, coupled, with, essentially, superficial, knowledge, of, hiv, transmission, according, to, siecus, the, sexuality, information, and, education, council, of, the, united, states, 93, of, adults, they, surveyed, support, sexuality, education, in, high, school, and, 84, support, it, in, junior, high, school, in, fact, 88, of, the, parents, of, junior, high, school, students, and, 80, of, parents, of, secondary, school, students, believe, that, sex, education, in, school, makes, it, easier, for, them, to, talk, to, their, adolescents, about, sex, also, 92, of, adolescents, report, that, they, want, both, to, talk, to, their, parents, about, sex, and, to, have, comprehensive, in, school, sex, education, furthermore, a, study, conducted, by, mathematica, policy, research, on, behalf, of, the, us, department, of, health, and, human, services, found, that, abstinence, only, until, marriage, programs, are, ineffective, the, current, frontier, in, the, development, of, relationship, and, sex, education, rse, is, lgbt, q, inclusion, the, recent, 2019, guidance, update, is, tentative, in, its, acknowledgement, of, lgbt, people, something, which, has, proved, controversial, among, homo, and, transphobic, groups, as, well, as, among, lgbt, allies, and, pro, inclusion, sociologists, for, example, while, birmingham, primary, schools, were, protested, by, muslim, parents, opposing, the, introduction, of, lgbt, content, to, the, guidance, sociologist, jonathan, glazzard, criticized, the, department, for, education, for, the, document, s, ambiguity, and, opt, out, potential, the, inclusion, of, this, form, of, sex, education, is, argued, to, make, lgbt, students, feel, more, included, and, that, feelings, of, safety, would, foster, healthy, developmental, outcomes, for, this, group, leepson, sees, sex, education, as, instruction, in, various, physiological, psychological, and, sociological, aspects, of, sexual, response, and, reproduction, kearney, 2008, also, defined, sex, education, as, involving, a, comprehensive, course, of, action, by, the, school, calculated, to, bring, about, the, socially, desirable, attitudes, practices, and, personal, conduct, on, the, part, of, children, and, adults, that, will, best, protect, the, individual, as, a, human, and, the, family, as, a, social, institution, thus, sex, education, may, also, be, described, as, sexuality, education, which, means, that, it, encompasses, education, about, all, aspects, of, sexuality, including, information, about, family, planning, reproduction, fertilization, conception, and, development, of, the, embryo, and, fetus, through, to, childbirth, plus, information, about, all, aspects, of, one, s, sexuality, including, body, image, sexual, orientation, sexual, pleasure, values, decision, making, communication, dating, relationships, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, and, how, to, avoid, them, and, birth, control, methods, various, aspects, of, sex, education, are, considered, appropriate, in, school, depending, on, the, age, of, the, students, or, what, the, children, can, comprehend, at, a, particular, point, in, time, rubin, and, kindendall, expressed, that, sex, education, is, not, merely, the, topics, of, reproduction, and, teaching, how, babies, are, conceived, and, born, instead, it, has, a, far, richer, scope, and, goal, of, helping, children, incorporate, sex, more, meaningfully, into, their, present, and, future, life, and, to, provide, them, with, some, basic, understanding, of, virtually, every, aspect, of, sex, by, the, time, they, reach, full, maturity, evidence, shows, that, a, combination, of, comprehensive, sexuality, education, and, access, to, birth, control, appears, to, decrease, the, rates, of, unintended, pregnancies, among, teenagers, a, meta, analysis, that, compared, comprehensive, sexuality, education, programs, with, abstinence, only, programs, found, that, abstinence, only, programs, did, not, reduce, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, but, rather, may, have, increased, it, numerous, studies, show, that, curricula, providing, accurate, information, about, condoms, and, contraception, can, lead, to, reductions, in, the, risky, behaviors, reported, by, young, people, as, well, as, reductions, in, unintended, pregnancies, and, stis, programs, that, teach, only, abstinence, have, not, been, shown, to, be, effective, according, to, unfpa, a, 2010, review, found, that, gender, focused, curricula, meaning, curricula, that, integrate, gender, equality, into, the, learning, material, were, substantially, more, effective, in, reducing, risky, behaviors, than, programmes, that, did, not, consider, gender, research, has, also, shown, that, delay, in, sexual, initiation, use, of, condoms, and, practice, contraception, has, been, a, result, of, young, people, adopting, egalitarian, attitudes, about, gender, roles, these, individuals, were, also, found, to, be, less, likely, engaged, in, violent, relationships, and, have, a, lower, rate, of, stis, including, hiv, and, unintended, pregnancy, by, emphasizing, rights, and, gender, issues, these, programs, help, reduce, gender, based, violence, and, bullying, promote, safe, schools, empower, young, people, to, advocate, for, their, own, rights, and, advance, gender, equality, few, sexual, health, interventions, are, designed, with, input, from, adolescents, adolescents, have, suggested, that, sex, education, should, be, more, positive, with, less, emphasis, on, anatomy, and, scare, tactics, it, should, focus, on, negotiation, skills, in, sexual, relationships, and, communication, and, details, of, sexual, health, clinics, should, be, advertised, in, areas, that, adolescents, frequent, for, example, school, toilets, shopping, centres, also, a, u, s, review, concludes, that, the, overwhelming, weight, of, evidence, shows, that, sex, education, that, discusses, contraception, does, not, increase, sexual, activity, the, 2007, study, found, that, no, comprehensive, program, hastened, the, initiation, of, sex, or, increased, the, frequency, of, sex, results, that, many, people, fear, further, the, report, showed, comprehensive, programs, worked, for, both, genders, for, all, major, ethnic, groups, for, sexually, inexperienced, and, experienced, teens, in, different, settings, and, in, different, communities, the, united, nations, population, fund, unfpa, recommends, comprehensive, sexuality, education, as, it, enables, young, people, to, make, informed, decisions, about, their, sexuality, according, to, unfpa, it, is, taught, over, several, years, introducing, age, appropriate, information, consistent, with, the, evolving, capacities, of, young, people, it, includes, scientifically, accurate, curriculum, based, information, about, human, development, anatomy, and, pregnancy, it, also, includes, information, about, contraception, and, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, including, hiv, and, it, goes, beyond, information, to, encourage, confidence, and, improved, communication, skills, curricula, should, also, address, the, social, issues, surrounding, sexuality, and, reproduction, including, cultural, norms, family, life, and, interpersonal, relationships, when, places, have, more, comprehensive, sexuality, education, sti, and, pregnancy, rates, drop, the, attitudes, of, children, have, also, been, found, to, differ, depending, on, the, content, of, their, sex, education, one, comparison, of, results, can, be, made, between, the, sex, education, curriculum, in, the, netherlands, and, that, in, the, us, on, average, teens, in, europe, and, the, netherlands, which, have, more, comprehensive, sex, ed, do, not, have, sex, at, a, younger, age, than, teens, in, the, us, with, less, comprehensive, sex, ed, however, teens, in, the, netherlands, report, having, a, positive, and, consensual, first, sexual, experience, while, 66, of, sexually, active, us, teens, report, that, they, wished, they, waited, longer, for, their, first, sexual, experience, nine, out, of, ten, teens, in, the, netherlands, use, contraception, during, their, first, sexual, experience, which, contributes, to, the, lower, pregnancy, and, sti, rates, more, comprehensive, sex, ed, starting, at, the, elementary, level, resulted, in, appreciation, of, sexual, diversity, dating, and, intimate, partner, violence, prevention, development, of, healthy, relationships, prevention, of, child, sex, abuse, improved, social, emotional, learning, and, increased, media, literacy, human, rights, issues, gender, equality, and, gender, roles, should, be, integrated, into, every, aspect, of, these, discussions, this, includes, human, rights, protection, fulfillment, and, empowerment, the, impact, of, gender, discrimination, the, importance, of, equality, and, gender, sensitivity, and, the, ideas, underlying, gender, roles, sexual, abuse, gender, based, violence, and, harmful, practices, should, also, be, discussed, taken, together, all, this, information, teaches, young, people, the, life, skills, necessary, to, assume, responsibility, for, their, own, behavior, and, to, respect, the, rights, of, others, comprehensive, sexuality, education, enables, young, people, to, make, informed, decisions, about, their, sexuality, and, health, these, programmes, build, life, skills, and, increase, responsible, behaviors, and, because, they, are, based, on, human, rights, principles, they, help, advance, human, rights, gender, equality, and, the, empowerment, of, young, people, sex, education, may, be, taught, informally, such, as, when, someone, receives, information, from, a, conversation, with, a, parent, friend, religious, leader, or, through, the, media, it, may, also, be, delivered, through, sex, self, help, authors, magazine, advice, columnists, sex, columnists, or, sexual, education, discussion, board, web, sites, sex, education, training, for, parents, and, educators, can, also, be, accessed, on, the, internet, through, multimedia, educational, resources, including, short, videos, created, by, master, sexuality, educators, adolescents, spend, a, lot, of, their, time, on, social, media, or, watching, television, those, same, adolescents, may, also, have, a, hard, time, talking, to, their, families, about, sexual, matters, a, study, has, shown, that, mass, media, interventions, for, example, use, of, teaching, sexual, education, through, commercials, shown, on, television, or, ads, on, social, media, have, proven, effective, and, decreased, the, amount, of, unprotected, sex, formal, sex, education, occurs, when, schools, or, health, care, providers, offer, sex, education, slyer, stated, that, sex, education, teaches, the, young, person, what, he, or, she, should, know, for, his, or, her, personal, conduct, and, relationship, with, others, gruenberg, also, stated, that, sex, education, is, necessary, to, prepare, the, young, for, the, task, ahead, according, to, him, officials, generally, agree, that, some, kind, of, planned, sex, education, is, necessary, sometimes, formal, sex, education, is, taught, as, a, full, course, as, part, of, the, curriculum, in, junior, high, school, or, high, school, other, times, it, is, only, one, unit, within, a, more, broad, biology, health, home, economics, or, physical, education, class, some, schools, offer, no, sex, education, since, it, remains, a, controversial, issue, in, several, countries, particularly, the, united, states, especially, with, regard, to, the, age, at, which, children, should, start, receiving, such, education, the, amount, of, detail, that, is, revealed, including, lgbt, sex, education, and, topics, dealing, with, human, sexual, behavior, e, g, safe, sex, practices, masturbation, premarital, sex, and, sexual, ethics, wilhelm, reich, commented, that, sex, education, of, his, time, was, a, work, of, deception, focusing, on, biology, while, concealing, excitement, arousal, which, is, what, a, pubescent, individual, is, mostly, interested, in, reich, added, that, this, emphasis, obscures, what, he, believed, to, be, a, basic, psychological, principle, that, all, worries, and, difficulties, originate, from, unsatisfied, sexual, impulses, leepson, asserted, that, the, majority, of, people, favor, some, sort, of, sex, instruction, in, public, schools, and, this, has, become, an, intensely, controversial, issue, because, unlike, most, subjects, sex, education, is, concerned, with, an, especially, sensitive, and, highly, personal, part, of, human, life, he, suggested, that, sex, education, should, be, taught, in, the, classroom, the, problem, of, pregnancy, in, adolescents, is, delicate, and, difficult, to, assess, using, sex, education, but, calderone, believed, otherwise, stating, that, the, answer, to, adolescents, sexual, woes, and, pregnancy, can, not, lie, primarily, in, school, programmes, which, at, best, can, only, be, remedial, what, is, needed, is, prevention, education, and, as, such, parents, should, be, involved, when, sex, education, is, contentiously, debated, the, chief, controversial, points, are, whether, covering, child, sexuality, is, valuable, or, detrimental, whether, lgbt, sex, education, should, be, integrated, into, the, curriculum, the, use, of, birth, control, such, as, condoms, and, hormonal, contraception, and, the, impact, of, such, use, on, pregnancy, outside, marriage, teenage, pregnancy, and, the, transmission, of, stis, increasing, support, for, abstinence, only, sex, education, by, conservative, groups, has, been, one, of, the, primary, causes, of, this, controversy, countries, with, conservative, attitudes, towards, sex, education, including, the, uk, and, the, u, s, have, a, higher, incidence, of, stis, and, teenage, pregnancy, on, the, other, hand, it, seems, that, in, countries, where, sex, education, is, not, part, of, the, curriculum, students, show, limited, knowledge, even, in, basic, reproductive, issues, for, example, in, a, 2019, study, with, greek, students, it, is, reported, that, about, two, thirds, of, the, students, failed, to, name, external, female, genitals, such, as, the, clitoris, and, labia, even, after, detailed, pictures, were, provided, to, them, a, survey, conducted, in, britain, canada, and, the, united, states, by, angus, reid, public, opinion, in, november, 2011, asked, adult, respondents, to, look, back, to, the, time, when, they, were, teenagers, and, describe, how, useful, several, sources, were, in, enabling, them, to, learn, more, about, sex, by, far, the, largest, proportion, of, respondents, in, the, three, countries, 74, in, canada, 67, in, britain, and, 63, in, the, united, states, said, that, conversations, with, friends, were, very, useful, or, moderately, useful, the, next, reputable, source, was, the, media, television, books, movies, magazines, mentioned, by, three, in, five, british, 65, and, canadians, 62, and, more, than, half, of, americans, 54, as, useful, in, 2011, angus, reid, public, opinion, said, that, half, of, canadians, 54, and, americans, 52, found, their, sex, education, courses, at, school, to, be, useful, only, 43, of, britons, share, the, same, view, and, while, more, than, half, of, americans, 57, say, conversations, with, family, were, useful, only, 49, of, canadians, and, 35, of, britons, said, so, sex, education, in, africa, has, focused, on, stemming, the, growing, aids, epidemic, most, governments, in, the, region, have, established, aids, education, programs, in, partnership, with, the, world, health, organization, and, international, ngos, these, programs, were, undercut, significantly, by, the, mexico, city, policy, an, initiative, put, in, place, by, president, ronald, reagan, suspended, by, president, bill, clinton, and, re, instated, by, president, george, w, bush, the, global, gag, rule, required, nongovernmental, organizations, to, agree, as, a, condition, of, their, receipt, of, federal, funds, that, such, organizations, would, neither, perform, nor, actively, promote, abortion, as, a, method, of, family, planning, in, other, nations, the, policy, was, again, suspended, as, one, of, the, first, official, acts, by, united, states, president, barack, obama, new, hiv, infections, in, uganda, decreased, dramatically, when, clinton, supported, a, comprehensive, sexuality, education, approach, including, information, about, contraception, and, abortion, according, to, ugandan, aids, activists, the, policy, undermined, community, efforts, to, reduce, hiv, prevalence, and, hiv, transmission, egypt, teaches, knowledge, about, male, and, female, reproductive, systems, sexual, organs, contraception, and, stds, in, public, schools, at, the, second, and, third, years, of, the, middle, preparatory, phase, when, students, are, aged, 12, 14, a, coordinated, program, between, undp, unicef, and, the, ministries, of, health, and, education, promotes, sexual, education, at, a, larger, scale, in, rural, areas, and, spreads, awareness, of, the, dangers, of, female, genital, mutilation, the, state, of, sex, education, programs, in, asia, is, at, various, stages, of, development, the, topic, of, sex, education, being, considered, to, be, very, controversial, because, it, deals, with, different, topics, which, are, sometimes, too, vague, and, too, broad, to, be, implemented, largely, in, the, society, in, thailand, there, has, been, progress, on, sex, education, with, the, boundaries, being, pushed, forward, with, each, revision, of, the, curriculum, the, first, national, policy, on, sexuality, education, in, schools, was, announced, in, 1938, but, sex, education, was, not, taught, in, schools, until, 1978, it, was, then, called, life, and, family, studies, and, its, content, consisted, of, issues, related, to, the, reproductive, system, and, personal, hygiene, the, education, curriculum, has, been, revised, several, times, involving, efforts, from, both, government, and, non, government, sectors, and, sex, education, has, been, accepted, as, a, problem, solving, tool, for, adolescent, sexual, reproduction, and, health, issues, this, has, been, a, result, of, educational, reform, following, the, national, education, act, b, e, 2542, increasing, awareness, of, problems, related, to, adolescents, sexual, practices, and, the, emergence, of, women, s, sexuality, and, queer, movements, another, new, approach, in, sexuality, education, curricula, in, thailand, has, been, the, teenpath, project, developed, by, path, thailand, path, has, also, succeeded, in, institutionalizing, sexuality, education, curricula, in, schools, since, 2003, in, india, there, are, many, programs, promoting, sex, education, including, information, on, aids, sex, and, sexuality, in, schools, as, well, public, education, and, advertising, aids, clinics, however, are, not, universally, available, india, has, a, strong, prevention, program, which, goes, hand, in, hand, with, care, support, and, treatment, we, have, been, able, to, contain, the, epidemic, with, a, prevalence, of, just, 0, 31, we, have, also, brought, about, a, decline, of, 50, in, new, infections, annually, untaboo, a, company, dedicated, to, sex, education, however, has, age, appropriate, programs, on, sex, sexuality, and, safety, awareness, education, which, are, conducted, in, schools, and, in, small, private, groups, outside, of, schools, sexual, reproduction, and, different, contraceptive, methods, are, taught, in, grades, 8, and, 10, age, 14, and, 16, compulsorily, in, 2000, a, new, five, year, project, was, introduced, by, the, china, family, planning, association, to, promote, reproductive, health, education, among, chinese, teenagers, and, unmarried, youth, in, twelve, urban, districts, and, three, counties, this, included, discussion, about, sex, within, human, relationships, as, well, as, pregnancy, and, hiv, prevention, since, the, 2010s, there, has, been, a, great, increase, in, books, about, sex, education, for, children, and, young, adults, the, state, of, sex, education, programs, in, china, barely, meets, the, international, standards, china, s, sex, education, is, absent, although, there, have, been, proposals, made, to, include, comprehensive, sexuality, education, in, the, curriculum, although, such, proposals, have, been, made, there, has, not, been, any, solid, actions, to, implement, such, programs, in, school, mainly, due, to, the, conservative, and, traditional, mindsets, the, topic, of, sex, is, not, talked, about, enough, in, public, and, even, shunned, in, private, teachers, and, parents, alike, are, embarrassed, to, talk, about, sex, related, topics, that, such, education, is, often, skipped, making, this, topic, extremely, sensitive, there, is, demand, for, sex, education, that, is, concentrated, on, social, media, platforms, such, as, weibo, citing, the, need, to, have, sex, education, for, its, people, to, learn, how, to, protect, themselves, against, sexual, related, abuse, and, harassments, china, currently, still, experiences, sexual, illiteracy, china, s, government, has, passed, a, law, that, mandates, age, appropriate, sex, education, in, october, 2020, but, no, outlines, have, been, created, yet, to, clarify, how, the, mandate, would, be, implemented, in, school, most, recently, china, has, introduced, a, new, sexual, education, for, students, named, the, healthy, china, initiatives, 2019, 2030, the, initiative, came, after, a, 2015, study, by, the, china, family, planning, association, conducted, a, study, that, showed, only, 10, of, approximately, 20, 000, universities, reported, that, they, were, not, content, with, their, sexual, education, in, grade, school, and, were, unknowledgeable, to, violence, gender, contraceptives, sexually, transmitted, diseases, and, pregnancy, among, other, topics, the, initiative, is, said, to, help, provide, students, with, knowledge, of, gender, sexuality, equality, consent, and, rights, south, korea, has, the, most, insufficient, sex, education, among, developed, countries, in, particular, sex, education, in, public, education, is, the, insufficient, and, pre, modern, so, there, are, not, a, few, criticisms, about, this, in, south, korea, for, example, unlike, europe, sex, education, in, south, korea, doesn, t, teach, in, detail, the, process, of, sexual, intercourse, and, the, use, of, condoms, etc, or, does, not, teach, at, all, in, addition, there, are, cases, in, which, the, government, censors, sex, education, books, under, pressure, from, conservative, and, parent, groups, mbc, reported, that, 67, out, of, 68, censored, sex, education, books, are, harmless, however, the, authorities, censored, them, the, attitudes, of, most, south, korean, parents, are, also, problematic, there, are, many, cases, where, they, protest, against, detailed, sex, education, with, resistance, as, a, representative, example, there, was, a, case, where, a, demonstration, of, how, to, use, a, condom, was, attempted, but, it, was, suspended, due, to, protest, in, addition, there, was, even, a, case, in, which, parents, and, their, relatives, went, to, the, convenience, store, and, protested, for, selling, condoms, that, teenagers, could, legally, purchase, under, south, korean, law, for, these, reasons, some, south, korean, parents, who, want, to, properly, educate, their, children, about, sex, rely, on, private, education, for, sex, education, because,

encouraged, abstinence, only, education, by, steering, over, a, billion, dollars, to, such, programs, some, 25, states, now, decline, the, funding, so, that, they, can, continue, to, teach, comprehensive, sexuality, education, funding, for, one, of, the, federal, government, s, two, main, abstinence, only, funding, programs, title, v, was, extended, only, until, december, 31, 2007, congress, is, debating, whether, to, continue, it, past, that, date, in, 2007, a, study, ordered, by, the, u, s, congress, found, that, middle, school, students, who, took, part, in, abstinence, only, sex, education, programs, were, just, as, likely, to, have, sex, and, use, contraception, in, their, teenage, years, as, those, who, did, not, abstinence, only, advocates, claimed, that, the, study, was, flawed, because, it, was, too, narrow, and, began, when, abstinence, only, curricula, were, in, their, infancy, and, that, other, studies, have, demonstrated, positive, effects, proponents, of, comprehensive, sexuality, education, which, include, the, american, psychological, association, the, american, medical, association, the, national, association, of, school, psychologists, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, the, american, public, health, association, and, the, american, college, health, association, argue, that, sexual, behavior, after, puberty, is, a, given, and, it, is, therefore, crucial, to, provide, information, about, the, risks, and, how, they, can, be, minimized, they, also, claim, that, denying, teens, such, factual, information, leads, to, stis, and, unwanted, pregnancies, a, 2007, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, report, showed, a, 3, increase, in, teenage, pregnancies, from, 2005, to, 2006, to, nearly, 42, births, per, 1, 000, apart, from, this, the, rate, of, teen, pregnancy, has, been, declining, consistently, since, 1991, still, the, u, s, has, the, highest, teen, birth, rate, and, one, of, the, highest, rates, of, stis, among, teens, in, the, industrialized, world, the, government, of, victoria, australia, developed, a, policy, for, the, promotion, of, health, and, human, relations, education, in, schools, in, 1980, that, was, introduced, into, the, state, s, primary, and, secondary, schools, during, 1981, the, initiative, was, developed, and, implemented, by, the, honorable, norman, lacy, mp, minister, for, educational, services, from, 1979, to, 1982, a, consultative, council, for, health, and, human, relations, education, was, established, in, december, 1980, under, the, chairmanship, of, dame, margaret, blackwood, its, members, possessed, considerable, expertise, in, the, area, the, council, had, three, major, functions, support, services, for, the, consultative, council, were, provided, by, a, new, health, and, human, relations, unit, within, the, special, services, division, of, the, education, department, of, victoria, and, was, responsible, for, the, implementation, of, the, government, s, policy, and, guidelines, in, this, area, the, unit, advised, principals, school, councils, teachers, parents, tertiary, institutions, and, others, in, all, aspects, of, health, and, human, relations, education, in, 1981, the, consultative, council, recommended, the, adoption, of, a, set, of, guidelines, for, the, provision, of, health, and, human, relations, education, in, schools, as, well, as, a, curriculum, statement, to, assist, schools, in, the, development, of, their, programs, these, were, presented, to, the, victorian, cabinet, in, december, 1981, and, adopted, as, government, policy, as, of, march, 2021, a, program, called, respectful, relationships, was, a, core, part, of, victoria, s, curriculum, and, was, to, become, mandatory, in, all, state, schools, students, will, also, be, specifically, taught, about, consent, in, new, zealand, sexuality, education, is, part, of, the, health, and, physical, education, curriculum, which, is, compulsory, for, the, first, ten, years, of, schooling, years, 1, to, 10, but, optional, beyond, that, sexual, and, reproductive, health, education, begins, at, year, 7, approximately, age, 11, although, broader, issues, such, as, physical, emotional, and, social, development, personal, and, interpersonal, skills, and, non, sexual, relationships, begin, as, early, as, year, 1, approximately, age, 5, the,

consultations, must, occur, at, least, once, every, two, years, parents, can, ask, for, their, children, to, be, removed, from, the, sexuality, education, component, of, the, health, curriculum, for, any, reason, provided, they, apply, in, writing, to, the, school, principal, and, do, so, at, least, 24, hours, beforehand, so, alternative, arrangements, can, be, made, however, this, does, not, prevent, a, teacher, answering, sexuality, education, questions, if, a, student, excluded, or, not, asks, them, there, are, two, opposing, sides, of, the, sex, education, argument, among, parents, sexual, liberals, see, knowledge, on, sex, as, equipping, individuals, to, make, informed, decisions, about, their, personal, sexuality, and, they, are, in, favor, of, comprehensive, sexual, education, all, throughout, schooling, not, just, in, high, school, sexual, conservatives, see, knowledge, on, sex, as, encouraging, adolescents, to, have, sex, and, they, believe, that, sex, should, be, taught, inside, the, family, for, their, morals, to, be, included, in, the, conversation, sexual, conservatives, see, the, importance, of, teaching, sex, education, but, only, through, abstinence, only, programs, another, viewpoint, on, sex, education, historically, inspired, by, sexologists, such, as, wilhelm, reich, and, psychologists, such, as, sigmund, freud, and, james, w, prescott, holds, that, what, is, at, stake, in, sex, education, is, control, over, the, body, and, liberation, from, social, control, proponents, of, this, view, tend, to, see, the, political, question, as, whether, society, or, the, individual, should, teach, sexual, mores, sexual, education, may, thus, be, seen, as, providing, individuals, with, the, knowledge, necessary, to, liberate, themselves, from, socially, organized, sexual, oppression, and, to, make, up, their, own, minds, in, addition, sexual, oppression, may, be, viewed, as, socially, harmful, sex, and, relationship, experts, like, reid,
