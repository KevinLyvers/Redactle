ice, skating, is, the, self, propulsion, and, gliding, of, a, person, across, an, ice, surface, using, metal, bladed, ice, skates, people, skate, for, various, reasons, including, recreation, fun, exercise, competitive, sports, and, commuting, ice, skating, may, be, performed, on, naturally, frozen, bodies, of, water, such, as, ponds, lakes, canals, and, rivers, and, on, human, made, ice, surfaces, both, indoors, and, outdoors, natural, ice, surfaces, used, by, skaters, can, accommodate, a, variety, of, winter, sports, which, generally, require, an, enclosed, area, but, are, also, used, by, skaters, who, need, ice, tracks, and, trails, for, distance, skating, and, speed, skating, man, made, ice, surfaces, include, ice, rinks, ice, hockey, rinks, bandy, fields, ice, tracks, required, for, the, sport, of, ice, cross, downhill, and, arenas, various, formal, sports, involving, ice, skating, have, emerged, since, the, 19th, century, ice, hockey, bandy, rinkball, and, ringette, are, team, sports, played, with, respectively, a, flat, sliding, puck, a, ball, and, a, rubber, ring, synchronized, skating, is, a, unique, artistic, team, sport, derived, from, figure, skating, figure, skating, ice, cross, downhill, speed, skating, and, barrel, jumping, a, discipline, of, speed, skating, are, among, the, sporting, disciplines, for, individuals, research, suggests, that, the, earliest, ice, skating, happened, in, southern, finland, more, than, 4, 000, years, ago, this, was, done, to, save, energy, during, winter, journeys, true, skating, emerged, when, a, steel, blade, with, sharpened, edges, was, used, skates, now, cut, into, the, ice, instead, of, gliding, on, top, of, it, the, dutch, added, edges, to, ice, skates, in, the, 13th, or, 14th, century, these, ice, skates, were, made, of, steel, with, sharpened, edges, on, the, bottom, to, aid, movement, the, fundamental, construction, of, modern, ice, skates, has, stayed, largely, the, same, since, then, although, differing, greatly, in, the, details, particularly, in, the, method, of, binding, and, the, shape, and, construction, of, the, steel, blades, in, the, netherlands, ice, skating, was, considered, proper, for, all, classes, of, people, as, shown, in, many, pictures, from, dutch, golden, age, painters, ice, skating, was, also, practiced, in, china, during, the, song, dynasty, and, became, popular, among, the, ruling, family, of, the, qing, dynasty, ancient, ice, skates, made, of, animal, bones, were, found, at, the, bronze, age, gaotai, ruins, in, north, west, china, and, are, estimated, to, be, likely, 3, 500, years, old, archeologists, say, these, ancient, skates, are, clear, evidence, for, communication, between, china, and, europe, in, the, bronze, age, er, a, as, they, are, very, similar, to, bone, skates, unearthed, in, europe, in, england, the, london, boys, had, improvised, butcher, s, bones, as, skates, since, the, 12th, century, skating, on, metal, skates, seems, to, have, arrived, in, england, at, the, same, time, as, the, garden, canal, with, the, english, restoration, in, 1660, after, the, king, and, court, returned, from, an, exile, largely, spent, in, the, netherlands, in, london, the, ornamental, canal, in, st, james, s, park, was, the, main, centre, until, the, 19th, century, both, samuel, pepys, and, john, evelyn, the, two, leading, diarists, of, the, day, saw, it, on, the, new, canal, there, on, 1, december, 1662, the, first, time, pepys, had, ever, seen, it, a, very, pretty, art, then, it, was, performed, before, their, majesties, and, others, by, diverse, gentlemen, and, others, with, scheets, after, the, manner, of, the, hollanders, two, weeks, later, on, 15, december, 1662, pepys, accompanied, the, duke, of, york, later, king, james, ii, on, a, skating, outing, to, the, duke, and, followed, him, in, the, park, when, though, the, ice, was, broken, he, would, go, slide, upon, his, skates, which, i, did, not, like, but, he, slides, very, well, in, 1711, jonathan, swift, still, thinks, the, sport, might, be, unfamiliar, to, his, stella, writing, to, her, delicate, walking, weather, and, the, canal, and, rosamund, s, pond, full, of, the, rabble, and, with, skates, if, you, know, what, that, is, the, first, organised, skating, club, was, the, edinburgh, skating, club, formed, in, the, 1740s, some, claim, the, club, was, established, as, early, as, 1642, an, early, contemporary, reference, to, the, club, appeared, in, the, second, edition, 1783, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, the, metropolis, of, scotland, has, produced, more, instances, of, elegant, skaters, than, perhaps, any, country, whatever, and, the, institution, of, a, skating, club, about, 40, years, ago, has, contributed, not, a, little, to, the, improvement, of, this, elegant, amusement, from, this, description, and, others, it, is, apparent, that, the, form, of, skating, practiced, by, club, members, was, indeed, an, early, form, of, figure, skating, rather, than, speed, skating, for, admission, to, the, club, candidates, had, to, pass, a, skating, test, where, they, performed, a, complete, circle, on, either, foot, e, g, a, figure, eight, and, then, jumped, over, first, one, hat, then, two, and, three, placed, over, each, other, on, the, ice, on, the, continent, participation, in, ice, skating, was, limited, to, members, of, the, upper, classes, emperor, rudolf, ii, of, the, holy, roman, empire, enjoyed, ice, skating, so, much, he, had, a, large, ice, carnival, constructed, in, his, court, in, order, to, popularise, the, sport, king, louis, xvi, of, france, brought, ice, skating, to, paris, during, his, reign, madame, de, pompadour, napoleon, i, napoleon, iii, and, the, house, of, stuart, were, among, others, royal, and, upper, class, fans, of, ice, skating, the, next, skating, club, to, be, established, was, in, london, and, was, not, founded, until, 1830, members, wore, a, silver, skate, hanging, from, their, buttonhole, and, met, on, the, serpentine, hyde, park, on, 27th, december, 1830, by, the, mid, 19th, century, ice, skating, was, a, popular, pastime, among, the, british, upper, and, middle, classes, queen, victoria, became, acquainted, with, her, future, husband, prince, albert, through, a, series, of, ice, skating, trips, albert, continued, to, skate, after, their, marriage, and, on, falling, through, the, ice, was, once, rescued, by, victoria, and, a, lady, in, waiting, from, a, stretch, of, water, in, the, grounds, of, buckingham, palace, early, attempts, at, the, construction, of, artificial, ice, rinks, were, made, during, the, rink, mania, of, 1841, 44, as, the, technology, for, the, maintenance, of, natural, ice, did, not, exist, these, early, rinks, used, a, substitute, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, hog, s, lard, and, various, salts, an, item, in, the, 8, may, 1844, issue, of, littell, s, living, age, headed, the, glaciarium, reported, that, this, establishment, which, has, been, removed, to, grafton, street, east, tottenham, court, road, was, opened, on, monday, afternoon, the, area, of, artificial, ice, is, extremely, convenient, for, such, as, may, be, desirous, of, engaging, in, the, graceful, and, manly, pastime, of, skating, skating, became, popular, as, a, recreation, a, means, of, transport, and, spectator, sport, in, the, fens, in, england, for, people, from, all, walks, of, life, racing, was, the, preserve, of, workers, most, of, them, agricultural, labourers, it, is, not, known, when, the, first, skating, matches, were, held, but, by, the, early, nineteenth, century, racing, was, well, established, and, the, results, of, matches, were, reported, in, the, press, skating, as, a, sport, developed, on, the, lakes, of, scotland, and, the, canals, of, the, netherlands, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, wood, was, substituted, for, bone, in, skate, blades, and, in, 1572, the, first, iron, skates, were, manufactured, when, the, waters, froze, skating, matches, were, held, in, towns, and, villages, all, over, the, fens, in, these, local, matches, men, or, sometimes, women, or, children, would, compete, for, prizes, of, money, clothing, or, food, the, winners, of, local, matches, were, invited, to, take, part, in, the, grand, or, championship, matches, in, which, skaters, from, across, the, fens, would, compete, for, cash, prizes, in, front, of, crowds, of, thousands, the, championship, matches, took, the, form, of, a, welsh, main, or, last, man, standing, contest, single, elimination, tournament, the, competitors, 16, or, sometimes, 32, were, paired, off, in, heats, and, the, winner, of, each, heat, went, through, to, the, next, round, a, course, of, 660, yards, was, measured, out, on, the, ice, and, a, barrel, with, a, flag, on, it, placed, at, either, end, for, a, one, and, a, half, mile, race, the, skaters, completed, two, rounds, of, the, course, with, three, barrel, turns, in, the, fens, skates, were, called, pattens, fen, runners, or, whittlesey, runners, the, footstock, was, made, of, beechwood, a, screw, at, the, back, was, screwed, into, the, heel, of, the, boot, and, three, small, spikes, at, the, front, kept, the, skate, steady, there, were, holes, in, the, footstock, for, leather, straps, to, fasten, it, to, the, foot, the, metal, blades, were, slightly, higher, at, the, back, than, the, front, in, the, 1890s, fen, skaters, started, to, race, in, norwegian, style, skates, on, saturday, 1, february, 1879, a, number, of, professional, ice, skaters, from, cambridgeshire, and, huntingdonshire, met, in, the, guildhall, cambridge, to, set, up, the, national, skating, association, the, first, national, ice, skating, body, in, the, world, the, founding, committee, consisted, of, several, landowners, a, vicar, a, fellow, of, trinity, college, a, magistrate, two, members, of, parliament, the, mayor, of, cambridge, the, lord, lieutenant, of, cambridge, journalist, james, drake, digby, the, president, of, cambridge, university, skating, club, and, neville, goodman, a, graduate, of, peterhouse, cambridge, and, son, of, potto, brown, s, milling, partner, joseph, goodman, the, newly, formed, association, held, their, first, one, and, a, half, mile, british, professional, championship, at, thorney, in, december, 1879, the, first, instructional, book, concerning, ice, skating, was, published, in, london, in, 1772, the, book, titled, the, art, of, figure, skating, written, by, a, british, artillery, lieutenant, robert, jones, describes, basic, figure, skating, forms, such, as, circles, and, figure, eights, the, book, was, written, solely, for, men, as, women, did, not, normally, ice, skate, in, the, late, 18th, century, it, was, with, the, publication, of, this, manual, that, ice, skating, split, into, its, two, main, disciplines, speed, skating, and, figure, skating, the, founder, of, modern, figure, skating, as, it, is, known, today, was, jackson, haines, an, american, he, was, the, first, skater, to, incorporate, ballet, and, dance, movements, into, his, skating, as, opposed, to, focusing, on, tracing, patterns, on, the, ice, haines, also, invented, the, sit, spin, and, developed, a, shorter, curved, blade, for, figure, skating, that, allowed, for, easier, turns, he, was, also, the, first, to, wear, blades, that, were, permanently, attached, to, the, boot, the, international, skating, union, was, founded, in, 1892, as, the, first, international, ice, skating, organisation, in, scheveningen, in, the, netherlands, the, union, created, the, first, codified, set, of, figure, skating, rules, and, governed, international, competition, in, speed, and, figure, skating, the, first, championship, known, as, the, championship, of, the, internationale, eislauf, vereinigung, was, held, in, saint, petersburg, in, 1896, the, event, had, four, competitors, and, was, won, by, gilbert, fuchs, a, skate, can, glide, over, ice, because, there, is, a, layer, of, ice, molecules, on, the, surface, that, are, not, as, tightly, bound, as, the, molecules, of, the, mass, of, ice, beneath, these, molecules, are, in, a, semiliquid, state, providing, lubrication, the, molecules, in, this, quasi, fluid, or, water, like, layer, are, less, mobile, than, liquid, water, but, are, much, more, mobile, than, the, molecules, deeper, in, the, ice, at, about, 157, c, 250, f, the, slippery, layer, is, one, molecule, thick, as, the, temperature, increases, the, slippery, layer, becomes, thicker, it, had, long, been, believed, that, ice, is, slippery, because, the, pressure, of, an, object, in, contact, with, it, causes, a, thin, layer, to, melt, the, hypothesis, was, that, the, blade, of, an, ice, skate, exerting, pressure, on, the, ice, melts, a, thin, layer, providing, lubrication, between, the, ice, and, the, blade, this, explanation, called, pressure, melting, originated, in, the, 19th, century, see, regelation, pressure, melting, could, not, account, for, skating, on, ice, temperatures, lower, than, 3, 5, c, whereas, skaters, often, skate, on, lower, temperature, ice, in, the, 20th, century, an, alternative, explanation, called, friction, melting, proposed, by, lozowski, szilder, le, berre, pomeau, and, others, showed, that, because, of, the, viscous, frictional, heating, a, macroscopic, layer, of, melt, ice, is, in, between, the, ice, and, the, skate, with, this, they, fully, explained, the, low, friction, with, nothing, else, but, macroscopic, physics, whereby, the, frictional, heat, generated, between, skate, and, ice, melts, a, layer, of, ice, this, is, a, self, stabilizing, mechanism, of, skating, if, by, fluctuation, the, friction, gets, high, the, layer, grows, in, thickness, and, lowers, the, friction, and, if, it, gets, low, the, layer, decreases, in, thickness, and, increases, the, friction, the, friction, generated, in, the, sheared, layer, of, water, between, skate, and, ice, grows, as, v, with, v, the, velocity, of, the, skater, such, that, for, low, velocities, the, friction, is, also, low, whatever, the, origin, of, the, water, layer, skating, is, more, destructive, than, simply, gliding, a, skater, leaves, a, visible, trail, behind, on, virgin, ice, and, skating, rinks, have, to, be, regularly, resurfaced, to, improve, the, skating, conditions, it, means, that, the, deformation, caused, by, the, skate, is, plastic, rather, than, elastic, the, skate, ploughs, through, the, ice, in, particular, due, to, the, sharp, edges, thus, another, component, has, to, be, added, to, the, friction, the, ploughing, friction, the, calculated, frictions, are, of, the, same, order, as, the, measured, frictions, in, real, skating, in, a, rink, the, ploughing, friction, decreases, with, the, velocity, v, since, the, pressure, in, the, water, layer, increases, with, v, and, lifts, the, skate, aquaplaning, as, a, result, the, sum, of, the, water, layer, friction, and, the, ploughing, friction, only, increases, slightly, with, v, making, skating, at, high, speeds, 90, km, h, possible, a, person, s, ability, to, ice, skate, depends, on, the, roughness, of, the, ice, the, design, of, the, ice, skate, and, the, skill, and, experience, of, the, skater, while, serious, injury, is, rare, a, number, of, short, track, speed, skaters, have, been, paralysed, after, a, heavy, fall, when, they, collided, with, the, boarding, a, fall, can, be, fatal, if, a, helmet, is, not, worn, to, protect, against, severe, head, injury, accidents, are, rare, but, there, is, a, risk, of, injury, from, collisions, particularly, during, hockey, games, or, in, pair, skating, a, significant, danger, when, skating, outdoors, on, a, frozen, body, of, water, is, falling, through, the, ice, into, the, freezing, water, underneath, death, can, result, from, shock, hypothermia, or, drowning, it, is, often, difficult, or, impossible, for, the, skater, to, climb, out, of, the, water, due, to, the, weight, of, their, ice, skates, and, thick, winter, clothing, and, the, ice, repeatedly, breaking, as, they, struggle, to, get, back, onto, the, surface, also, if, the, skater, becomes, disoriented, under, the, water, they, might, not, be, able, to, find, the, hole, in, the, ice, through, which, they, have, fallen, although, this, can, prove, fatal, it, is, also, possible, for, the, rapid, cooling, to, produce, a, condition, in, which, a, person, can, be, revived, up, to, hours, after, falling, into, the, water, experts, have, warned, not, to, ice, skate, alone, and, also, warned, parents, not, to, leave, children, unattended, on, a, frozen, body, of, water, a, number, of, recreational, and, sporting, activities, take, place, on, ice, the, following, sports, and, games, are, also, played, on, ice, but, players, are, not, required, to, wear, ice, skates
