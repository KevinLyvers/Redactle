a, shoe, is, an, item, of, footwear, intended, to, protect, and, comfort, the, human, foot, though, the, human, foot, can, adapt, to, varied, terrains, and, climate, conditions, it, is, vulnerable, and, shoes, provide, protection, form, was, originally, tied, to, function, but, over, time, shoes, also, became, fashion, items, some, shoes, are, worn, as, safety, equipment, such, as, steel, toe, boots, which, are, required, footwear, at, industrial, worksites, additionally, shoes, have, often, evolved, into, many, different, designs, such, as, high, heels, which, are, most, commonly, worn, by, women, during, fancy, occasions, contemporary, footwear, varies, vastly, in, style, complexity, and, cost, basic, sandals, may, consist, of, only, a, thin, sole, and, simple, strap, and, be, sold, for, a, low, cost, high, fashion, shoes, made, by, famous, designers, may, be, made, of, expensive, materials, use, complex, construction, and, sell, for, large, sums, of, money, some, shoes, are, designed, for, specific, purposes, such, as, boots, designed, specifically, for, mountaineering, or, skiing, while, others, have, more, generalized, usage, such, as, sneakers, which, have, transformed, from, a, special, purpose, sport, shoe, into, a, general, use, shoe, traditionally, shoes, have, been, made, from, leather, wood, or, canvas, but, are, increasingly, being, made, from, rubber, plastics, and, other, petrochemical, derived, materials, globally, the, shoe, industry, is, a, 200, billion, a, year, industry, 90, of, shoes, end, up, in, landfills, because, the, materials, are, hard, to, separate, recycle, or, otherwise, reuse, the, earliest, known, shoes, are, sagebrush, bark, sandals, dating, from, approximately, 7000, or, 8000, bc, found, in, the, fort, rock, cave, in, the, us, state, of, oregon, in, 1938, the, world, s, oldest, leather, shoe, made, from, a, single, piece, of, cowhide, laced, with, a, leather, cord, along, seams, at, the, front, and, back, was, found, in, the, areni, 1, cave, complex, in, armenia, in, 2008, and, is, believed, to, date, to, 3500, bc, tzi, the, iceman, s, shoes, dating, to, 3300, bc, featured, brown, bearskin, bases, deerskin, side, panels, and, a, bark, string, net, which, pulled, tight, around, the, foot, the, jotunheimen, shoe, was, discovered, in, august, 2006, archaeologists, estimate, that, this, leather, shoe, was, made, between, 1800, and, 1100, bc, making, it, the, oldest, article, of, clothing, discovered, in, scandinavia, sandals, and, other, plant, fiber, based, tools, were, found, in, cueva, de, los, murci, lagos, in, albu, ol, in, southern, spain, in, 2023, dating, to, approximately, 7500, to, 4200, bc, making, them, what, are, believed, to, be, the, oldest, shoes, found, in, europe, it, is, thought, that, shoes, may, have, been, used, long, before, this, but, because, the, materials, used, were, highly, perishable, it, is, difficult, to, find, evidence, of, the, earliest, footwear, footprints, suggestive, of, shoes, or, sandals, due, to, having, crisp, edges, no, signs, of, toes, found, and, three, small, divots, where, leather, tying, laces, straps, would, have, been, attached, have, been, at, garden, route, national, park, addo, elephant, national, park, and, goukamma, nature, reserve, in, south, africa, these, date, back, to, between, 73, 000, and, 136, 000, pb, consistent, with, the, existence, of, such, shoe, is, the, finding, of, bone, awls, dating, back, to, this, period, that, could, have, made, simple, footwear, another, source, of, evidence, is, the, study, of, the, bones, of, the, smaller, toes, as, opposed, to, the, big, toe, it, was, observed, that, their, thickness, decreased, approximately, 40, 000, to, 26, 000, years, ago, this, led, archaeologists, to, deduce, the, existence, of, common, rather, than, an, occasional, wearing, of, shoes, as, this, would, lead, to, less, bone, growth, resulting, in, shorter, thinner, toes, these, earliest, designs, were, very, simple, often, mere, foot, bags, of, leather, to, protect, the, feet, from, rocks, debris, and, cold, many, early, natives, in, north, america, wore, a, similar, type, of, footwear, known, as, the, moccasin, these, are, tight, fitting, soft, soled, shoes, typically, made, out, of, leather, or, bison, hides, many, moccasins, were, also, decorated, with, various, beads, and, other, adornments, moccasins, were, not, designed, to, be, waterproof, and, in, wet, weather, and, warm, summer, months, most, native, americans, went, barefoot, the, leaves, of, the, sisal, plant, were, used, to, make, twine, for, sandals, in, south, america, while, the, natives, of, mexico, used, the, yucca, plant, as, civilizations, began, to, develop, thong, sandals, precursors, to, the, modern, flip, flop, were, worn, this, practice, dates, back, to, pictures, of, them, in, ancient, egyptian, murals, from, 4000, bc, thebet, may, have, been, the, term, used, to, describe, these, sandals, in, egyptian, times, possibly, from, the, city, thebes, the, middle, kingdom, is, when, the, first, of, these, thebets, were, found, but, it, is, possible, that, it, debuted, in, the, early, dynastic, period, one, pair, found, in, europe, was, made, of, papyrus, leaves, and, dated, to, be, approximately, 1, 500, years, old, they, were, also, worn, in, jerusalem, during, the, first, century, of, the, christian, era, thong, sandals, were, worn, by, many, civilizations, and, made, from, a, vast, variety, of, materials, ancient, egyptian, sandals, were, made, from, papyrus, and, palm, leaves, the, masai, of, africa, made, them, out, of, rawhide, in, india, they, were, made, from, wood, while, thong, sandals, were, commonly, worn, many, people, in, ancient, times, such, as, the, egyptians, hindus, and, greeks, saw, little, need, for, footwear, and, most, of, the, time, preferred, being, barefoot, the, egyptians, and, hindus, made, some, use, of, ornamental, footwear, such, as, a, soleless, sandal, known, as, a, cleopatra, which, did, not, provide, any, practical, protection, for, the, foot, the, ancient, greeks, largely, viewed, footwear, as, self, indulgent, unaesthetic, and, unnecessary, shoes, were, primarily, worn, in, the, theater, as, a, means, of, increasing, stature, and, many, preferred, to, go, barefoot, athletes, in, the, ancient, olympic, games, participated, barefoot, and, naked, even, the, gods, and, heroes, were, primarily, depicted, barefoot, as, well, as, the, hoplite, warriors, they, fought, battles, in, bare, feet, and, alexander, the, great, conquered, his, vast, empire, with, barefoot, armies, the, runners, of, ancient, greece, had, also, been, believed, to, have, run, barefoot, the, romans, who, eventually, conquered, the, greeks, and, adopted, many, aspects, of, their, culture, did, not, adopt, the, greek, perception, of, footwear, and, clothing, roman, clothing, was, seen, as, a, sign, of, power, and, footwear, was, seen, as, a, necessity, of, living, in, a, civilized, world, although, the, slaves, and, paupers, usually, went, barefoot, roman, soldiers, were, issued, with, chiral, left, and, right, shoe, different, footwear, shoes, for, soldiers, had, riveted, insoles, to, extend, the, life, of, the, leather, increase, comfort, and, provide, better, traction, the, design, of, these, shoes, also, designated, the, rank, of, the, officers, the, more, intricate, the, insignia, and, the, higher, up, the, boot, went, on, the, leg, the, higher, the, rank, of, the, soldier, there, are, references, to, shoes, being, worn, in, the, bible, in, china, and, japan, rice, straws, were, used, starting, around, 4, bc, the, greeks, began, wearing, symbolic, footwear, these, were, heavily, decorated, to, clearly, indicate, the, status, of, the, wearer, courtesans, wore, leather, shoes, colored, with, white, green, lemon, or, yellow, dyes, and, young, woman, betrothed, or, newly, married, wore, pure, white, shoes, because, of, the, cost, to, lighten, leather, shoes, of, a, paler, shade, were, a, symbol, of, wealth, in, the, upper, class, often, the, soles, would, be, carved, with, a, message, so, it, would, imprint, on, the, ground, cobblers, became, a, notable, profession, around, this, time, with, greek, shoemakers, becoming, famed, in, the, roman, empire, a, common, casual, shoe, in, the, pyrenees, during, the, middle, ages, was, the, espadrille, this, is, a, sandal, with, braided, jute, soles, and, a, fabric, upper, portion, and, often, includes, fabric, laces, that, tie, around, the, ankle, the, term, is, french, and, comes, from, the, esparto, grass, the, shoe, originated, in, the, catalonian, region, of, spain, as, early, as, the, 13th, century, and, was, commonly, worn, by, peasants, in, the, farming, communities, in, the, area, new, styles, began, to, develop, during, the, song, dynasty, in, china, one, of, them, being, the, debut, of, foot, straps, it, was, first, used, by, the, noble, han, classes, but, soon, developed, throughout, society, women, would, use, these, shoes, to, develop, their, lotus, feet, which, would, entice, the, males, the, practice, allegedly, started, during, the, shang, dynasty, but, it, grew, popular, by, c, ad, 960, when, the, mongols, conquered, china, they, dissolved, the, practice, in, 1279, and, the, manchus, banned, foot, binding, in, 1644, the, han, people, however, continued, to, use, the, style, without, much, government, intervention, in, medieval, times, shoes, could, be, up, to, two, feet, long, with, their, toes, sometimes, filled, with, hair, wool, moss, or, grass, many, medieval, shoes, were, made, using, the, turnshoe, method, of, construction, in, which, the, upper, was, turned, flesh, side, out, and, was, lasted, onto, the, sole, and, joined, to, the, edge, by, a, seam, the, shoe, was, then, turned, inside, out, so, that, the, grain, was, outside, some, shoes, were, developed, with, toggled, flaps, or, drawstrings, to, tighten, the, leather, around, the, foot, for, a, better, fit, surviving, medieval, turnshoes, often, fit, the, foot, closely, with, the, right, and, left, shoe, being, mirror, images, around, 1500, the, turnshoe, method, was, largely, replaced, by, the, welted, rand, method, where, the, uppers, are, sewn, to, a, much, stiffer, sole, and, the, shoe, cannot, be, turned, inside, out, the, turn, shoe, method, is, still, used, for, some, dance, and, specialty, shoes, by, the, 15th, century, pattens, became, popular, by, both, men, and, women, in, europe, these, are, commonly, seen, as, the, predecessor, of, the, modern, high, heeled, shoe, while, the, poor, and, lower, classes, in, europe, as, well, as, slaves, in, the, new, world, were, barefoot, in, the, 15th, century, the, crakow, was, fashionable, in, europe, this, style, of, shoe, is, named, because, it, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, krak, w, the, capital, of, poland, the, style, is, characterized, by, the, point, of, the, shoe, known, as, the, polaine, which, often, was, supported, by, a, whalebone, tied, to, the, knee, to, prevent, the, point, getting, in, the, way, while, walking, also, during, the, 15th, century, chopines, were, created, in, spain, and, were, usually, 7, 8, in, 180, 200, mm, high, these, shoes, became, popular, in, venice, and, throughout, europe, as, a, status, symbol, revealing, wealth, and, social, standing, during, the, 16th, century, royalty, such, as, catherine, de, medici, or, mary, i, of, england, started, wearing, high, heeled, shoes, to, make, them, look, taller, or, larger, than, life, by, 1580, even, men, wore, them, and, a, person, with, authority, or, wealth, was, often, referred, to, as, well, heeled, in, 17th, century, france, heels, were, exclusively, worn, by, aristocrats, louis, xiv, of, france, outlawed, anybody, from, wearing, red, high, heels, except, for, himself, and, his, royal, court, eventually, the, modern, shoe, with, a, sewn, on, sole, was, devised, since, the, 17th, century, most, leather, shoes, have, used, a, sewn, on, sole, this, remains, the, standard, for, finer, quality, dress, shoes, today, until, around, 1800, welted, rand, shoes, were, commonly, made, without, differentiation, for, the, left, or, right, foot, such, shoes, are, now, referred, to, as, straights, only, gradually, did, the, modern, foot, specific, shoe, become, standard, shoemaking, became, more, commercialized, in, the, mid, 18th, century, as, it, expanded, as, a, cottage, industry, large, warehouses, began, to, stock, footwear, made, by, many, small, manufacturers, from, the, area, until, the, 19th, century, shoemaking, was, a, traditional, handicraft, but, by, the, century, s, end, the, process, had, been, almost, completely, mechanized, with, production, occurring, in, large, factories, despite, the, obvious, economic, gains, of, mass, production, the, factory, system, produced, shoes, without, the, individual, differentiation, that, the, traditional, shoemaker, was, able, to, provide, the, 19th, century, was, when, chinese, feminists, called, for, an, end, to, the, use, of, foot, straps, and, a, ban, in, 1902, was, implemented, the, ban, was, soon, repealed, until, it, was, banned, again, in, 1911, by, the, new, nationalist, government, it, was, effective, in, coastal, cities, but, countryside, cities, continued, without, much, regulation, mao, zedong, enforced, the, rule, in, 1949, and, it, continues, throughout, contemporary, times, a, number, of, people, still, have, lotus, feet, today, the, first, steps, towards, mechanisation, were, taken, during, the, napoleonic, wars, by, the, engineer, marc, brunel, he, developed, machinery, for, the, mass, production, of, boots, for, the, soldiers, of, the, british, army, in, 1812, he, devised, a, scheme, for, making, nailed, boot, making, machinery, that, automatically, fastened, soles, to, uppers, by, means, of, metallic, pins, or, nails, with, the, support, of, the, duke, of, york, the, shoes, were, manufactured, and, due, to, their, strength, cheapness, and, durability, were, introduced, for, the, use, of, the, army, in, the, same, year, the, use, of, screws, and, staples, was, patented, by, richard, woodman, brunel, s, system, was, described, by, sir, richard, phillips, as, a, visitor, to, his, factory, in, battersea, as, follows, in, another, building, i, was, shown, his, manufactory, of, shoes, which, like, the, other, is, full, of, ingenuity, and, in, regard, to, subdivision, of, labour, brings, this, fabric, on, a, level, with, the, oft, admired, manufactory, of, pins, every, step, in, it, is, affected, by, the, most, elegant, and, precise, machinery, while, as, each, operation, is, performed, by, one, hand, so, each, shoe, passes, through, twenty, five, hands, who, complete, from, the, hide, as, supplied, by, the, currier, a, hundred, pairs, of, strong, and, well, finished, shoes, per, day, all, the, details, are, performed, by, the, ingenious, application, of, the, mechanic, powers, and, all, the, parts, are, characterised, by, precision, uniformity, and, accuracy, as, each, man, performs, but, one, step, in, the, process, which, implies, no, knowledge, of, what, is, done, by, those, who, go, before, or, follow, him, so, the, persons, employed, are, not, shoemakers, but, wounded, soldiers, who, are, able, to, learn, their, respective, duties, in, a, few, hours, the, contract, at, which, these, shoes, are, delivered, to, government, is, 6s, 6d, per, pair, being, at, least, 2s, less, than, what, was, paid, previously, for, an, unequal, and, cobbled, article, however, when, the, war, ended, in, 1815, manual, labour, became, much, cheaper, and, the, demand, for, military, equipment, subsided, as, a, consequence, brunel, s, system, was, no, longer, profitable, and, it, soon, ceased, business, similar, exigencies, at, the, time, of, the, crimean, war, stimulated, a, renewed, interest, in, methods, of, mechanization, and, mass, production, which, proved, longer, lasting, a, shoemaker, in, leicester, tomas, crick, patented, the, design, for, a, riveting, machine, in, 1853, his, machine, used, an, iron, plate, to, push, iron, rivets, into, the, sole, the, process, greatly, increased, the, speed, and, efficiency, of, production, he, also, introduced, the, use, of, steam, powered, rolling, machines, for, hardening, leather, and, cutting, machines, in, the, mid, 1850s, the, sewing, machine, was, introduced, in, 1846, and, provided, an, alternative, method, for, the, mechanization, of, shoemaking, by, the, late, 1850s, the, industry, was, beginning, to, shift, towards, the, modern, factory, mainly, in, the, us, and, areas, of, england, a, shoe, stitching, machine, was, invented, by, the, american, lyman, blake, in, 1856, and, perfected, by, 1864, entering, into, a, partnership, with, mckay, his, device, became, known, as, the, mckay, stitching, machine, and, was, quickly, adopted, by, manufacturers, throughout, new, england, as, bottlenecks, opened, up, in, the, production, line, due, to, these, innovations, more, and, more, of, the, manufacturing, stages, such, as, pegging, and, finishing, became, automated, by, the, 1890s, the, process, of, mechanisation, was, largely, complete, on, january, 24, 1899, humphrey, o, sullivan, of, lowell, massachusetts, was, awarded, a, patent, for, a, rubber, heel, for, boots, and, shoes, a, process, for, manufacturing, stitchless, that, is, glued, shoes, ago, was, developed, in, 1910, since, the, mid, 20th, century, advances, in, rubber, plastics, synthetic, cloth, and, industrial, adhesives, have, allowed, manufacturers, to, create, shoes, that, stray, considerably, from, traditional, crafting, techniques, leather, which, had, been, the, primary, material, in, earlier, styles, has, remained, standard, in, expensive, dress, shoes, but, athletic, shoes, often, have, little, or, no, real, leather, soles, which, were, once, laboriously, hand, stitched, on, are, now, more, often, machine, stitched, or, simply, glued, on, many, of, these, newer, materials, such, as, rubber, and, plastics, have, made, shoes, less, biodegradable, it, is, estimated, that, most, mass, produced, shoes, require, 1000, years, to, degrade, in, a, landfill, in, the, late, 2000s, some, shoemakers, picked, up, on, the, issue, and, began, to, produce, shoes, made, entirely, from, degradable, materials, such, as, the, nike, considered, in, 2007, the, global, shoe, industry, had, an, overall, market, of, 107, 4, billion, in, terms, of, revenue, and, is, expected, to, grow, to, 122, 9, billion, by, the, end, of, 2012, shoe, manufacturers, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, account, for, 63, of, production, 40, 5, of, global, exports, and, 55, of, industry, revenue, however, many, manufacturers, in, europe, dominate, the, higher, priced, higher, value, added, end, of, the, market, as, an, integral, part, of, human, culture, and, civilization, shoes, have, found, their, way, into, our, culture, folklore, and, art, a, popular, 18th, century, nursery, rhyme, is, there, was, an, old, woman, who, lived, in, a, shoe, this, story, tells, about, an, old, woman, living, in, a, shoe, with, a, lot, of, children, in, 1948, mahlon, haines, a, shoe, salesman, in, hallam, pennsylvania, built, an, actual, house, shaped, like, a, work, boot, as, a, form, of, advertisement, the, haines, shoe, house, was, rented, to, newlyweds, and, the, elderly, until, his, death, in, 1962, since, then, it, has, served, as, an, ice, cream, parlor, a, bed, and, breakfast, and, a, museum, it, still, stands, today, and, is, a, popular, roadside, attraction, shoes, also, play, an, important, role, in, the, fairy, tales, cinderella, and, the, red, shoes, in, the, movie, adaption, of, the, children, s, book, the, wonderful, wizard, of, oz, a, pair, of, red, ruby, slippers, play,
