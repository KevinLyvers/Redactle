tequila, t, k, i, l, spanish, is, a, distilled, beverage, made, from, the, blue, agave, plant, primarily, in, the, area, surrounding, the, city, of, tequila, 65, km, 40, mi, northwest, of, guadalajara, and, in, the, jaliscan, highlands, los, altos, de, jalisco, of, the, central, western, mexican, state, of, jalisco, the, red, volcanic, soils, in, the, region, of, tequila, are, well, suited, for, growing, the, blue, agave, and, more, than, 300, million, plants, are, harvested, there, each, year, agave, grows, differently, depending, on, the, region, blue, agaves, grown, in, the, highlands, los, altos, region, are, larger, and, sweeter, in, aroma, and, taste, agaves, harvested, in, the, valley, region, have, a, more, herbaceous, fragrance, and, flavor, due, to, its, historical, and, cultural, importance, the, region, near, tequila, was, declared, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 2006, the, agave, landscape, and, ancient, industrial, facilities, of, tequila, mexican, laws, state, that, tequila, can, be, produced, only, in, the, state, of, jalisco, and, limited, municipalities, in, the, states, of, guanajuato, michoac, n, nayarit, and, tamaulipas, tequila, is, recognized, as, a, mexican, designation, of, origin, product, in, more, than, 40, countries, it, was, protected, through, nafta, in, canada, and, the, united, states, until, july, 2020, and, through, bilateral, agreements, with, individual, countries, such, as, japan, and, israel, and, it, has, been, a, protected, designation, of, origin, product, in, the, european, union, since, 1997, aside, from, its, geographical, distinction, tequila, is, differentiated, from, other, varieties, of, mezcal, in, that, all, of, the, agave, used, in, tequila, is, blue, agave, and, the, methods, of, production, are, different, tequila, is, commonly, served, neat, in, mexico, and, as, a, shot, with, salt, and, lime, around, the, world, tequila, must, have, between, 35, and, 55, alcohol, content, 70, and, 110, u, s, proof, the, distillation, technology, to, produce, mezcal, from, agave, heart, juice, was, first, introduced, from, the, coastal, regions, of, what, was, then, nueva, galicia, present, day, aguascalientes, colima, guanajuato, jalisco, nayarit, and, zacatecas, into, the, highland, valleys, of, amatit, n, tequila, magdalena, and, el, arenal, in, the, mid, 1700s, the, mezcal, produced, in, these, regions, became, distinctive, enough, as, to, become, known, as, tequila, after, the, town, prior, to, the, production, of, either, tequila, or, mezcal, pulque, had, been, brewed, from, agave, for, thousands, of, years, don, pedro, s, nchez, de, tagle, is, considered, the, first, person, to, produce, tequila, in, 1595, king, philip, ii, of, spain, banned, the, planting, of, new, vineyards, in, mexico, and, other, spanish, colonies, due, to, the, decline, of, wine, trade, with, spain, the, main, reason, behind, this, is, because, mexico, is, self, sufficient, in, producing, its, own, wines, the, king, did, this, to, maintain, the, market, for, spanish, products, in, the, new, world, and, reap, the, taxes, on, wine, exports, the, marquis, of, altamira, grabbed, the, opportunity, of, the, neglected, blue, agave, plants, he, built, his, first, tequila, factory, in, his, hacienda, cuisillos, one, of, the, largest, haciendas, during, that, time, and, amassed, a, great, fortune, the, marquis, is, now, known, today, as, the, father, of, tequila, don, pedro, also, served, as, the, prior, of, the, consulado, which, is, the, head, of, the, largest, corporation, in, mexico, spain, s, king, carlos, iv, granted, the, cuervo, family, the, first, legal, license, to, commercially, make, tequila, don, cenobio, sauza, founder, of, sauza, tequila, and, municipal, president, of, the, village, of, tequila, from, 1884, to, 1885, was, the, first, to, export, tequila, to, the, united, states, and, shortened, the, name, from, tequila, extract, to, just, tequila, for, the, american, markets, don, cenobio, s, grandson, don, francisco, javier, gained, international, attention, for, insisting, that, there, cannot, be, tequila, where, there, are, no, agaves, his, efforts, led, to, the, principle, that, real, tequila, can, come, only, from, the, state, of, jalisco, the, first, tequila, distillery, in, the, united, states, was, opened, in, 1936, in, nogales, arizona, by, harry, j, karns, former, arizona, state, senator, and, nogales, mayor, in, a, move, to, take, ownership, of, the, term, tequila, the, mexican, government, declared, the, term, to, be, its, intellectual, property, in, 1974, although, some, tequilas, have, remained, as, family, owned, brands, most, well, known, tequila, brands, are, owned, by, large, multinational, corporations, however, over, 100, distilleries, make, over, 900, brands, of, tequila, in, mexico, and, over, 2, 000, brand, names, have, been, registered, 2009, statistics, due, to, this, each, bottle, of, tequila, contains, a, serial, number, nom, denoting, in, which, distillery, the, tequila, was, produced, in, many, cases, multiple, different, brands, come, from, the, same, manufacturer, in, 2003, mexico, issued, a, proposal, that, would, require, all, mexican, made, tequila, be, bottled, in, mexico, before, being, exported, to, other, countries, the, mexican, government, said, that, bottling, tequila, in, mexico, would, guarantee, its, quality, liquor, companies, in, the, united, states, said, mexico, just, wanted, to, create, bottling, jobs, in, their, own, country, and, also, claimed, this, rule, would, violate, international, trade, agreements, and, was, in, discord, with, usual, exporting, practices, worldwide, the, proposal, might, have, resulted, in, the, loss, of, jobs, at, plants, in, california, arkansas, missouri, and, kentucky, because, mexican, tequila, exported, in, bulk, to, the, united, states, is, bottled, in, those, plants, on, january, 17, 2006, the, united, states, and, mexico, signed, an, agreement, allowing, the, continued, bulk, import, of, tequila, into, the, united, states, the, agreement, also, created, a, tequila, bottlers, registry, to, identify, approved, bottlers, of, tequila, and, created, an, agency, to, monitor, the, registry, the, tequila, regulatory, council, of, mexico, trcm, originally, did, not, permit, flavored, tequila, to, carry, the, tequila, name, in, 2004, the, council, decided, to, allow, flavored, tequila, to, be, called, tequila, with, the, exception, of, 100, agave, tequila, which, still, cannot, be, flavored, a, new, norma, oficial, mexicana, nom, for, tequila, nom, 006, scfi, 2005, was, issued, in, 2006, and, among, other, changes, introduced, a, class, of, tequila, called, extra, a, ejo, or, ultra, aged, which, must, be, aged, a, minimum, of, three, years, a, one, liter, bottle, of, limited, edition, premium, tequila, was, sold, for, 225, 000, in, july, 2006, in, tequila, jalisco, by, the, company, tequila, ley, 925, the, bottle, that, contained, the, tequila, was, a, two, kilo, display, of, platinum, and, gold, the, manufacturer, received, a, certificate, from, the, guinness, world, records, for, the, most, expensive, bottle, of, tequila, spirit, ever, sold, in, june, 2013, a, chinese, ban, on, the, importation, of, premium, 100, blue, agave, tequila, into, china, was, lifted, following, a, state, visit, to, mexico, by, chinese, communist, party, general, secretary, xi, jinping, the, entry, of, premium, tequila, into, the, country, was, expected, to, increase, tequila, exports, by, 20, percent, within, the, decade, above, the, 170, million, liters, in, 2013, ramon, gonzalez, director, of, the, consejo, regulador, del, tequila, estimates, that, each, of, the, top, 16, producers, of, tequila, had, invested, up, to, 3, million, to, enter, the, chinese, market, on, 30, august, 2013, the, first, 70, 380, bottles, of, premium, tequila, from, ten, brands, arrived, in, shanghai, the, arrival, happened, during, an, event, held, at, the, house, of, roosevelt, a, well, known, club, located, on, the, bund, an, area, with, a, long, tradition, of, importing, alcoholic, beverages, in, china, the, latest, version, of, the, tequila, standard, nom, 006, scfi, 2012, updated, the, standard, to, specify, that, the, silver, class, of, tequila, cannot, contain, additives, to, allow, the, aging, time, for, the, ultra, aged, class, to, be, displayed, on, the, label, and, to, prohibit, the, selling, of, bulk, tequila, through, vending, machines, and, required, registering, the, agave, during, the, calendar, year, of, its, plantation, and, required, annual, updates, in, 2018, the, mexican, government, approved, a, proposal, to, celebrate, the, third, saturday, of, march, as, national, tequila, day, planting, tending, and, harvesting, the, agave, plant, remains, a, manual, effort, largely, unchanged, by, modern, farm, machinery, and, relying, on, centuries, old, expertise, the, people, who, harvest, it, the, jimadores, have, intimate, knowledge, of, how, the, plants, should, be, cultivated, passed, down, from, generation, to, generation, by, regularly, trimming, any, quiotes, a, stalk, at, the, center, of, the, plant, that, could, grow, several, meters, high, if, not, cut, back, the, jimadores, prevent, the, agave, from, flowering, and, dying, early, allowing, it, to, fully, ripen, they, also, determine, when, each, plant, is, ready, to, be, harvested, and, using, a, special, knife, called, a, coa, with, a, circular, blade, on, a, long, pole, carefully, cut, away, the, leaves, from, the, pi, a, the, succulent, core, of, the, plant, which, can, average, around, 70, kg, 150, lb, in, the, valley, and, 110, kg, 240, lb, in, the, highlands, if, harvested, too, late, or, too, early, the, pi, as, will, not, have, the, right, amount, of, carbohydrates, for, fermentation, after, harvesting, the, pi, as, are, transported, to, ovens, where, they, are, slowly, baked, to, break, down, their, complex, fructans, into, simple, fructose, then, the, baked, pi, as, are, either, shredded, or, mashed, under, a, large, stone, wheel, called, a, tahona, the, pulp, fiber, or, bagazo, left, behind, is, often, reused, as, compost, or, animal, feed, or, can, be, used, as, fuel, or, processed, into, paper, some, producers, like, to, add, a, small, amount, of, bagazo, back, into, their, fermentation, tanks, for, a, stronger, agave, flavor, in, the, final, product, the, extracted, agave, juice, is, then, poured, into, either, large, wooden, or, stainless, steel, vats, for, several, days, to, ferment, resulting, in, a, wort, or, mosto, with, low, alcohol, content, this, wort, is, then, distilled, once, to, produce, what, is, called, ordinario, and, then, a, second, time, to, produce, clear, silver, tequila, a, minimum, of, two, distillations, is, required, by, law, a, few, producers, such, as, casa, noble, for, their, crystal, expression, and, corzo, for, their, a, ejo, expression, have, experimented, with, distilling, the, product, a, third, time, but, this, has, not, caught, on, as, a, trend, and, some, have, said, it, removes, too, much, of, the, agave, flavor, from, the, tequila, at, this, point, the, tequila, is, either, bottled, as, silver, tequila, or, it, is, pumped, into, wooden, barrels, to, age, where, it, develops, a, mellower, flavor, and, amber, color, the, differences, in, taste, between, tequila, made, from, valley, and, highland, agave, plants, can, be, noticeable, plants, grown, in, the, highlands, often, yield, sweeter, and, fruitier, tasting, tequila, while, valley, agaves, give, the, tequila, an, earthier, flavor, unlike, other, tequila, production, steps, fermentation, is, largely, outside, the, control, of, human, beings, fermentation, is, the, conversion, of, sugars, and, carbohydrates, to, alcohol, through, yeast, under, anaerobic, conditions, meaning, that, oxygen, is, not, present, during, the, process, fermentation, is, also, carried, out, in, a, non, aseptic, environment, which, increases, the, bacterial, activity, of, tequila, the, participation, of, microorganisms, from, the, environment, yeasts, and, bacteria, makes, fermentation, a, spontaneous, process, which, gives, rise, to, many, byproducts, that, contribute, to, the, flavor, and, aroma, of, tequila, during, the, fermentation, process, inoculum, is, added, to, the, batch, to, accelerate, the, rate, of, fermentation, when, inoculum, is, added, fermentation, can, take, approximately, 20, hours, to, 3, days, if, inoculum, is, not, added, fermentation, could, take, up, to, 7, days, the, rate, of, fermentation, is, a, key, factor, in, the, quality, and, flavor, of, tequila, produced, worts, fermented, slowly, are, best, because, the, amount, of, organoleptic, compounds, produced, is, greater, the, alcohol, content, at, the, end, of, fermentation, is, between, 4, 9, organoleptic, compounds, enhance, flavor, and, aroma, these, include, fusel, oil, methanol, aldehydes, organic, acids, and, esters, production, of, isoamyl, and, isobutyl, alcohols, begins, after, the, sugar, level, is, lowered, substantially, and, continues, for, several, hours, after, the, alcoholic, fermentation, ends, in, contrast, ethanol, production, begins, in, the, first, hours, of, the, fermentation, and, ends, with, logarithmic, yeast, growth, the, alcohol, content, in, tequila, is, affected, by, three, factors, the, amount, of, isoamyl, alcohol, and, isobutanol, in, the, yeast, strain, the, carbon, nitrogen, ratio, the, higher, the, ratio, the, more, alcohol, produced, and, the, temperature, of, fermentation, the, higher, the, temperature, the, greater, concentration, of, isobutyl, and, isoamyl, alcohols, produced, although, if, temperatures, are, too, high, this, can, cause, the, yeast, to, become, less, effective, similarly, if, the, temperature, is, too, low, the, process, occurs, too, slowly, this, can, become, a, large, issue, in, central, mexico, most, precisely, the, city, of, tequila, jalisco, where, most, tequila, is, processed, the, temperature, in, the, city, of, tequila, can, reach, 31, c, for, this, reason, tequila, producers, often, use, large, stainless, steel, tanks, for, fermentation, the, specific, yeasts, and, the, environments, in, which, they, act, determine, the, resultant, organoleptic, combinations, the, role, of, yeast, is, through, many, enzymatic, processes, to, turn, sugars, and, carbohydrates, into, alcohol, there, are, two, steps, first, in, aerobic, conditions, yeast, is, doubled, in, colony, size, every, four, hours, this, process, goes, on, for, 24, 48, hours, next, yeast, turns, acetaldehyde, into, ethyl, alcohol, which, is, known, as, one, of, the, organoleptic, compounds, produced, in, fermentation, the, two, main, categories, of, yeast, used, in, tequila, are, commercial, brewers, yeast, and, yeast, that, comes, from, precultivated, existing, yeast, that, has, been, preserved, the, use, of, either, type, of, yeast, can, result, in, different, end, products, of, tequila, traditional, production, uses, so, called, open, fermentation, relying, on, yeasts, from, the, surrounding, environment, a, 2023, article, analyzes, the, diversity, of, yeasts, found, in, these, uncontrolled, conditions, tequila, is, a, distilled, beverage, that, is, made, from, the, fermentation, of, the, sugars, in, the, blue, agave, plant, once, it, has, been, cooked, the, main, sugar, being, fructose, through, the, fermentation, process, many, factors, influence, the, higher, order, alcohols, present, in, tequila, which, include, molecules, such, as, isobutyl, alcohol, and, isoamyl, alcohol, along, with, the, ethanol, factors, include, the, strain, of, yeast, the, age, of, the, agave, plant, itself, temperature, and, the, ratio, of, carbon, to, nitrogen, the, yeast, strain, used, and, the, carbon, to, nitrogen, ratio, have, the, biggest, influence, on, the, production, of, higher, order, alcohols, this, is, not, surprising, as, production, of, ethanol, and, higher, order, alcohols, is, an, intrinsic, property, of, the, metabolism, of, each, strain, the, type, of, yeast, most, commonly, found, in, tequila, is, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, which, can, include, many, different, strains, for, example, cf1, agaves, a, type, of, yeast, produces, much, more, ethanol, than, a, cf2, strain, as, the, two, yeasts, metabolic, mechanisms, differ, prevalence, of, certain, strains, of, yeast, may, be, influenced, by, agricultural, practices, it, was, found, that, higher, ratios, of, carbon, to, nitrogen, resulted, in, greater, production, of, higher, order, alcohols, such, as, isobutyl, alcohol, and, isoamyl, alcohol, the, lower, level, of, nitrogen, in, the, fermentation, process, results, in, deamination, reactions, of, amino, acids, which, in, turn, leads, to, the, synthesis, of, higher, alcohols, the, ehrlich, pathway, refers, to, this, process, in, which, alpha, keto, acids, are, decarboxylated, and, transformed, to, aldehydes, and, to, higher, alcohols, the, temperature, of, the, fermentation, process, also, greatly, affects, the, alcohol, content, of, the, resulting, product, for, example, a, study, conducted, by, pinal, et, al, found, that, cultivating, two, strains, at, a, temperature, of, 35, c, as, compared, to, a, temperature, of, 30, c, produced, more, isoamyl, alcohol, the, higher, temperature, appears, to, be, favorable, for, the, action, of, the, yeast, the, age, of, the, agave, plant, is, also, a, factor, the, older, the, plant, the, greater, the, production, of, higher, order, alcohols, it, was, shown, in, a, study, that, the, concentration, of, amyl, alcohol, increased, by, 30, as, the, plant, aged, conversely, a, higher, concentration, of, methanol, is, found, when, using, younger, plants, this, change, may, be, due, to, differences, in, agricultural, practices, with, plants, of, different, ages, tequila, s, color, ranges, from, clear, to, a, brownish, amber, depending, on, the, aging, process, and, the, type, of, wood, used, for, storage, the, white, blanco, version, of, tequila, also, nicknamed, silver, is, the, product, with, no, aging, or, may, be, aged, less, than, two, months, it, is, the, purest, form, as, little, has, been, done, to, change, it, what, is, known, as, gold, joven, or, oro, tequila, is, usually, white, tequila, with, the, addition, of, grain, alcohols, and, caramel, color, however, some, higher, end, gold, tequilas, may, be, a, blend, of, white, and, reposado, rested, reposado, tequila, is, aged, for, a, relatively, short, time, two, months, or, more, and, aged, a, ejo, tequila, for, a, longer, time, a, year, or, more, all, aging, of, tequila, is, done, in, wooden, containers, the, aging, process, can, last, three, years, or, more, and, can, create, or, enhance, flavors, and, aromas, it, generally, imparts, a, golden, color, there, are, more, than, 300, known, compounds, in, tequila, many, of, which, are, produced, during, the, fermentation, process, the, raw, material, used, and, to, a, lesser, degree, during, the, maturation, the, components, that, make, up, tequila, do, not, act, individually, to, give, tequila, its, distinctive, flavor, and, aroma, but, rather, depend, on, the, interaction, and, quantity, of, each, volatile, compound, the, volatile, compounds, responsible, for, the, flavor, and, aroma, profiles, of, the, tequila, are, put, into, a, category, called, organoleptic, compounds, and, are, known, to, increase, in, concentration, with, a, slower, fermentation, process, the, organoleptic, compounds, produced, during, fermentation, include, higher, order, alcohols, methanol, esters, carbonyls, terpenes, and, furans, higher, order, alcohols, have, a, strong, aroma, and, the, quantity, present, in, each, tequila, depends, on, the, carbon, nitrogen, ratio, and, temperature, during, the, cooking, and, fermentation, processes, some, of, the, most, common, alcohols, present, other, than, ethanol, are, isoamyl, alcohol, isobutanol, and, 1, propanol, methanol, is, thought, to, be, mainly, generated, through, hydrolysis, of, methylated, pectin, which, is, naturally, present, in, the, agave, plant, but, there, has, been, speculation, that, it, is, also, partly, produced, from, the, enzymatic, reactions, of, yeast, strains, containing, pectin, methyl, esterase, enzyme, which, break, up, the, methoxyl, group, from, the, pectin, nearly, 50, different, esters, are, identified, in, tequila, which, together, give, rise, to, the, fruit, like, flavors, and, smell, one, of, the, most, abundant, esters, is, ethyl, acetate, which, is, synthesized, during, fermentation, by, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, using, alcohol, transferase, enzyme, which, links, acetic, acid, to, ethanol, in, general, the, longer, the, controlled, fermentation, period, the, higher, yield, of, esters, produced, during, the, fermentation, process, ethanol, is, oxidized, and, one, of, the, main, compounds, produced, are, acetaldehydes, which, adds, the, flavor, necessary, for, the, final, product, of, tequila, for, example, isovaleraldehyde, seems, to, produce, a, sweet, cocoa, and, chocolate, like, flavor, 2, and, 3, methylbutanal, produce, a, malty, flavor, the, agave, plant, contains, many, phenolics, such, as, vanillin, and, syringaldehydes, which, presents, a, strong, and, fruity, or, herbal, aroma, it, also, contains, eugenol, which, can, deliver, a, hint, of, spicy, flavor, to, the, tequila, since, the, production, of, tequila, involves, heating, maillard, browning, reactions, occur, and, furans, are, produced, during, the, thermal, degradation, of, sugar, the, most, prominent, furanic, compounds, include, 2, furaldehyde, and, 5, methylfuraldehyde, which, can, contribute, to, the, smoky, flavor, of, tequila, guaiacol, also, seems, to, contribute, to, tequila, s, smoky, flavor, beta, demascenone, contributes, to, the, woody, floral, taste, of, tequila, volatile, compounds, that, contribute, to, the, overall, taste, and, aroma, of, tequila, can, be, quantitatively, assessed, and, evaluated, by, gas, chromatography, discrimination, tests, such, as, duo, trio, and, triangle, tests, are, also, used, to, evaluate, the, quality, of, the, tequila, if, silver, or, white, blanco, tequila, is, the, desired, final, product, distillation, is, the, final, process, it, undergoes, rested, reposado, or, aged, a, ejo, tequila, must, be, matured, in, 200, liter, or, larger, white, oak, barrels, for, at, least, two, months, for, the, former, and, 12, months, for, the, latter, there, are, however, more, than, 50, different, companies, producing, tequila, in, the, mexican, province, of, jalisco, with, different, maturation, times, according, to, the, variety, of, tequila, and, desired, quality, of, the, final, product, all, companies, producing, tequila, have, their, aging, processes, regulated, and, fiscalized, by, the, mexican, government, the, maturation, process, causes, four, main, chemical, transformations, to, the, tequila, compounds, 1, decreasing, of, fusel, oils, by, the, char, in, barrels, which, acts, as, an, absorbing, agent, 2, extraction, of, complex, wood, constituents, by, tequila, giving, specific, aroma, and, flavor, to, the, final, product, 3, reactions, among, the, components, of, tequila, creating, new, chemical, compounds, and, 4, oxidation, of, the, original, contents, of, tequila, and, of, those, extracted, from, wood, the, final, results, of, these, changes, are, increased, concentrations, of, acids, esters, and, aldehydes, and, a, decrease, in, fusel, oil, concentration, reposado, may, be, rested, in, oak, barrels, or, casks, as, large, as, 20, 000, liters, 5, 280, gallons, allowing, for, richer, and, more, complex, flavors, the, preferred, oak, comes, from, the, us, france, or, canada, and, is, usually, white, oak, some, companies, char, the, wood, to, impart, a, smoky, flavor, or, use, barrels, previously, used, with, different, kinds, of, alcohol, e, g, whiskey, or, wine, some, reposados, can, also, be, aged, in, new, wood, barrels, to, achieve, the, same, woody, flavor, and, smoothness, but, in, less, time, a, ejos, are, often, rested, in, barrels, previously, used, to, rest, reposados, the, barrels, cannot, be, more, than, 600, liters, 158, gallons, and, most, are, in, the, 200, liter, 52, gallon, range, many, of, the, barrels, used, are, from, whiskey, distilleries, in, the, us, or, canada, and, jack, daniels, barrels, are, especially, popular, this, treatment, creates, many, of, the, aspects, of, the, dark, color, and, more, complex, flavors, of, the, a, ejo, tequila, after, aging, of, at, least, one, year, the, a, ejo, can, be, removed, from, the, wood, barrels, and, placed, in, stainless, steel, tanks, to, reduce, the, amount, of, evaporation, that, can, occur, in, the, barrels, tma, tristeza, y, muerte, de, agave, agave, depression, and, death, is, a, blight, that, has, reduced, the, production, of, the, agave, grown, to, produce, tequila, this, has, resulted, in, lower, production, and, higher, prices, throughout, the, early, 21st, century, and, due, to, the, long, maturation, of, the, plant, will, likely, continue, to, affect, prices, for, years, to, come, only, certain, mezcals, usually, from, the, state, of, oaxaca, are, ever, sold, con, gusano, with, worm, they, are, added, as, a, marketing, gimmick, and, are, not, traditional, the, tequila, regulatory, council, does, not, allow, gusanos, or, scorpions, which, are, sometimes, also, added, to, mezcals, to, be, included, in, tequila, bottles, the, worm, in, some, mezcals, is, actually, the, larval, form, of, the, moth, hypopta, agavis, which, lives, on, the, agave, plant, finding, one, in, the, plant, during, processing, indicates, an, infestation, and, correspondingly, a, lower, quality, product, however, the, misconception, that, tequilas, may, contain, worms, continues, despite, effort, and, marketing, to, represent, tequila, as, a, premium, liquor, the, norma, oficial, mexicana, nom, applies, to, all, processes, and, activities, related, to, the, supply, of, agave, production, bottling, marketing, information, and, business, practices, linked, to, the, distilled, alcoholic, beverage, known, as, tequila, tequila, must, be, produced, using, agave, of, the, species, tequilana, weber, blue, variety, grown, in, the, federal, states, and, municipalities, indicated, in, the, declaration, furthermore, the, nom, establishes, the, technical, specifications, and, legal, requirements, for, the, protection, of, the, appellation, of, origin, of, tequila, in, accordance, with, the, current, general, declaration, of, protection, of, the, appellation, of, origin, of, tequila, the, law, the, industrial, property, law, the, federal, consumer, protection, law, and, other, related, legal, provisions, all, authentic, regulated, tequilas, will, have, a, nom, identifier, on, the, bottle, the, important, laws, since, 1990, were, nom, 006, scfi, 1993, the, later, updates, nom, 006, scfi, 1994, and, nom, 006, scfi, 2005, and, the, most, recent, revision, published, on, december, 13, 2012, nom, 006, scfi, 2012, the, number, after, nom, is, the, distillery, number, assigned, by, the, government, nom, does, not, indicate, the, location, of, the, distillery, merely, the, parent, company, or, in, the, case, where, a, company, leases, space, in, a, plant, the, physical, plant, where, the, tequila, was, manufactured, unlike, wine, whose, character, may, change, in, taste, over, time, and, storage, conditions, tequila, does, not, change, much, once, bottled, even, without, ideal, storage, conditions, much, like, most, other, distilled, spirits, such, as, whiskey, rum, or, vodka, the, quality, characteristics, flavor, aroma, color, etc, of, a, tequila, are, primarily, determined, during, its, aging, in, wood, barrels, to, maintain, the, utmost, quality, though, some, conditions, should, be, met, a, constant, and, moderate, temperature, 60, to, 65, f, protection, from, direct, sunlight, and, maintenance, of, the, integrity, of, the, seal, of, the, bottle, improper, storage, conditions, will, have, more, effect, on, the, taste, of, aged, tequila, rather, than, the, un, aged, version, due, to, tannins, and, other, compounds, introduced, into, the, spirit, from, the, aging, barrel, for, instance, if, stored, in, improper, conditions, the, dark, and, more, complex, flavors, of, the, a, ejo, tequila, are, more, likely, to, be, tainted, than, the, blanco, or, the, silver, tequila, once, the, bottle, is, opened, the, tequila, will, be, subject, to, oxidation, which, will, continue, to, happen, even, if, no, more, oxygen, is, introduced, in, addition, if, the, bottle, has, more, room, for, air, the, process, of, oxidation, occurs, faster, on, the, liquor, remaining, inside, the, bottle, therefore, it, may, be, the, best, to, consume, the, tequila, within, one, or, two, years, after, opening, for, the, most, part, the, change, in, quality, of, tequila, is, due, to, extreme, conditions, of, improper, storage, not, due, to, oxidation, the, two, basic, categories, of, tequila, are, mixtos, and, 100, agave, mixtos, use, no, less, than, 51, agave, with, other, sugars, making, up, the, remainder, mixtos, use, both, glucose, and, fructose, sugars, there, are, also, four, categories, for, tequila, depending, on, the, aging, period, the, consejo, regulador, del, tequila, tequila, regulatory, council, reported, 1377, registered, brands, from, 150, producers, for, the, year, 2013, in, mexico, the, most, traditional, way, to, drink, tequila, is, neat, without, lime, and, salt, it, is, popular, in, some, regions, to, drink, fine, tequila, with, a, side, of, sangrita, a, sweet, sour, and, spicy, drink, typically, made, from, orange, juice, grenadine, or, tomato, juice, and, hot, chilli, equal, sized, shots, of, tequila, and, sangrita, are, sipped, alternately, without, salt, or, lime, another, popular, drink, in, mexico, is, the, bandera, flag, in, spanish, named, after, the, flag, of, mexico, it, consists, of, three, shot, glasses, filled, with, lime, juice, for, the, green, white, tequila, and, sangrita, for, the, red, outside, mexico, a, single, shot, of, tequila, is, often, served, with, salt, and, a, slice, of, lime, or, lemon, this, is, called, tequila, cruda, and, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, training, wheels, lick, sip, suck, or, lick, shoot, suck, referring, to, the, way, in, which, the, combination, of, ingredients, is, imbibed, the, drinkers, moisten, the, back, of, their, hands, below, the, index, finger, usually, by, licking, and, pour, on, the, salt, then, the, salt, is, licked, off, the, hand, the, tequila, is, drunk, and, the, fruit, slice, is, quickly, bitten, groups, of, drinkers, often, do, this, simultaneously, drinking, tequila, in, this, way, is, often, erroneously, called, a, tequila, slammer, which, is, in, fact, a, mix, of, tequila, and, carbonated, drink, though, the, traditional, mexican, shot, is, tequila, by, itself, lime, is, the, fruit, of, choice, when, a, chaser, must, be, used, the, salt, is, believed, to, lessen, the, burn, of, the, tequila, and, the, sour, fruit, balances, and, enhances, the, flavor, in, germany, and, some, other, countries, tequila, oro, gold, is, often, consumed, with, cinnamon, on, a, slice, of, orange, after, while, tequila, blanco, white, is, consumed, with, salt, and, lime, if, the, bottle, of, tequila, does, not, state, on, the, label, that, it, is, manufactured, from, 100, blue, agave, no, sugars, added, then, by,

however, the, tequila, regulatory, council, has, stated, only, tequilas, distilled, with, 100, agave, can, be, designated, as, 100, agave, many, of, the, higher, quality, 100, agave, tequilas, do, not, impart, significant, alcohol, burn, and, drinking, them, with, salt, and, lime, is, likely, to, remove, much, of, the, flavor, these, tequilas, are, usually, sipped, from, a, snifter, glass, rather, than, a, shot, glass, and, savoured, instead, of, quickly, gulped, doing, so, allows, the, taster, to, detect, subtler, fragrances, and, flavors, that, would, otherwise, be, missed, when, served, neat, without, any, additional, ingredients, tequila, is, most, often, served, in, a, narrow, shot, glass, called, a, caballito, little, horse, in, spanish, but, can, often, be, found, in, anything, from, a, snifter, to, a, tumbler, the, consejo, regulador, del, tequila, approved, an, official, tequila, glass, in, 2002, called, the, ouverture, tequila, glass, made, by, riedel, the,
