perfume, uk, p, f, j, u, m, us, p, r, f, j, u, m, is, a, mixture, of, fragrant, essential, oils, or, aroma, compounds, fragrances, fixatives, and, solvents, usually, in, liquid, form, used, to, give, the, human, body, animals, food, objects, and, living, spaces, an, agreeable, scent, perfumes, can, be, defined, as, substances, that, emit, and, diffuse, a, pleasant, and, fragrant, odor, they, consist, of, manmade, mixtures, of, aromatic, chemicals, and, essential, oils, the, 1939, nobel, laureate, for, chemistry, leopold, ru, i, ka, stated, in, 1945, that, right, from, the, earliest, days, of, scientific, chemistry, up, to, the, present, time, perfumes, have, substantially, contributed, to, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, as, regards, methods, systematic, classification, and, theory, ancient, texts, and, archaeological, excavations, show, the, use, of, perfumes, in, some, of, the, earliest, human, civilizations, modern, perfumery, began, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, commercial, synthesis, of, aroma, compounds, such, as, vanillin, or, coumarin, which, allowed, for, the, composition, of, perfumes, with, smells, previously, unattainable, solely, from, natural, aromatics, the, word, perfume, is, derived, from, the, latin, perfumare, meaning, to, smoke, through, perfumery, as, the, art, of, making, perfumes, began, in, ancient, mesopotamia, egypt, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, possibly, ancient, china, it, was, further, refined, by, the, romans, and, the, muslims, one, of, the, world, s, first, recorded, chemists, is, considered, to, be, a, woman, named, tapputi, a, perfume, maker, mentioned, in, a, cuneiform, tablet, from, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, in, mesopotamia, she, distilled, flowers, oil, and, calamus, with, other, aromatics, then, filtered, and, put, them, back, in, the, still, several, times, on, the, indian, subcontinent, perfume, and, perfumery, existed, in, the, indus, civilization, 3300, bc, 1300, bc, in, 2003, archaeologists, uncovered, what, are, believed, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, perfumes, in, pyrgos, cyprus, the, perfumes, dated, back, more, than, 4, 000, years, they, were, discovered, in, an, ancient, perfumery, a, 300, square, meter, 3, 230, sq, ft, factory, housing, at, least, 60, stills, mixing, bowls, funnels, and, perfume, bottles, in, ancient, times, people, used, herbs, and, spices, such, as, almond, coriander, myrtle, conifer, resin, and, bergamot, as, well, as, flowers, in, may, 2018, an, ancient, perfume, rodo, rose, was, recreated, for, the, greek, national, archaeological, museum, s, anniversary, show, countless, aspects, of, beauty, allowing, visitors, to, approach, antiquity, through, their, olfaction, receptors, in, the, 9th, century, the, arab, chemist, al, kindi, alkindus, wrote, the, book, of, the, chemistry, of, perfume, and, distillations, which, contained, more, than, a, hundred, recipes, for, fragrant, oils, salves, aromatic, waters, and, substitutes, or, imitations, of, costly, drugs, the, book, also, described, 107, methods, and, recipes, for, perfume, making, and, perfume, making, equipment, such, as, the, alembic, which, still, bears, its, arabic, name, described, by, synesius, in, the, 4th, century, the, persian, chemist, ibn, sina, also, known, as, avicenna, introduced, the, process, of, extracting, oils, from, flowers, by, means, of, distillation, the, procedure, most, commonly, used, today, he, first, experimented, with, the, rose, until, his, discovery, liquid, perfumes, consisted, of, mixtures, of, oil, and, crushed, herbs, or, petals, which, made, a, strong, blend, rose, water, was, more, delicate, and, immediately, became, popular, both, the, raw, ingredients, and, the, distillation, technology, significantly, influenced, western, perfumery, and, scientific, developments, particularly, chemistry, there, is, a, controversy, on, whether, perfumery, was, completely, lost, in, western, europe, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, that, said, the, art, of, perfumery, in, western, europe, was, reinvigorated, after, the, islamic, invasion, of, spain, and, southern, italy, in, 711, and, 827, the, islamic, controlled, cities, of, spain, al, andalus, became, major, producers, of, perfumes, that, were, traded, throughout, the, old, world, like, in, the, ancient, world, andalusians, used, fragrance, in, devotion, to, god, perfumes, added, a, layer, of, cleanliness, that, was, needed, for, their, devotion, andalusian, women, were, also, offered, greater, freedoms, than, women, in, other, muslim, controlled, regions, and, were, allowed, to, leave, their, homes, and, socialize, outside, this, freedom, allowed, courtship, to, occur, outside, of, the, home, as, a, result, andalusian, women, used, perfumes, for, courtship, recipes, of, perfumes, from, the, monks, of, santa, maria, delle, vigne, or, santa, maria, novella, of, florence, italy, were, recorded, from, 1221, in, the, east, the, hungarians, produced, around, 1370, a, perfume, made, of, scented, oils, blended, in, an, alcohol, solution, best, known, as, hungary, water, at, the, behest, of, queen, elizabeth, of, hungary, the, art, of, perfumery, prospered, in, renaissance, italy, and, in, the, 16th, century, the, personal, perfumer, to, catherine, de, medici, 1519, 1589, ren, the, florentine, renato, il, fiorentino, took, italian, refinements, to, france, his, laboratory, was, connected, with, her, apartments, by, a, secret, passageway, so, that, no, formulae, could, be, stolen, en, route, thanks, to, rene, france, quickly, became, one, of, the, european, centers, of, perfume, and, cosmetics, manufacture, cultivation, of, flowers, for, their, perfume, essence, which, had, begun, in, the, 14th, century, grew, into, a, major, industry, in, the, south, of, france, between, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, perfumes, were, used, primarily, by, the, wealthy, to, mask, body, odors, resulting, from, infrequent, bathing, in, 1693, italian, barber, giovanni, paolo, feminis, created, a, perfume, water, called, aqua, admirabilis, today, best, known, as, eau, de, cologne, his, nephew, johann, maria, farina, giovanni, maria, farina, took, over, the, business, in, 1732, by, the, 18th, century, the, grasse, region, of, france, sicily, and, calabria, in, italy, were, growing, aromatic, plants, to, provide, the, growing, perfume, industry, with, raw, materials, even, today, italy, and, france, remain, the, center, of, european, perfume, design, and, trade, perfume, types, reflect, the, concentration, of, aromatic, compounds, in, a, solvent, which, in, fine, fragrance, is, typically, ethanol, or, a, mix, of, water, and, ethanol, various, sources, differ, considerably, in, the, definitions, of, perfume, types, the, intensity, and, longevity, of, a, fragrance, is, based, on, the, concentration, intensity, and, longevity, of, the, aromatic, compounds, or, perfume, oils, used, as, the, percentage, of, aromatic, compounds, increases, so, does, the, intensity, and, longevity, of, the, scent, specific, terms, are, used, to, describe, a, fragrance, s, approximate, concentration, by, the, percent, of, perfume, oil, in, the, volume, of, the, final, product, the, most, widespread, terms, are, the, wide, range, in, the, percentages, of, aromatic, compounds, that, may, be, present, in, each, concentration, means, that, the, terminology, of, extrait, edp, edt, and, edc, is, quite, imprecise, with, regard, to, oil, concentration, although, an, edp, will, often, be, more, concentrated, than, an, edt, and, in, turn, an, edc, this, is, not, always, the, case, different, perfumeries, or, perfume, houses, assign, different, amounts, of, oils, to, each, of, their, perfumes, therefore, although, the, oil, concentration, of, a, perfume, in, edp, dilution, will, necessarily, be, higher, than, the, same, perfume, in, edt, from, within, a, company, s, same, range, the, actual, amount, will, vary, among, companies, an, edt, from, one, house, may, have, a, higher, concentration, of, aromatic, compounds, than, an, edp, from, another, furthermore, some, fragrances, with, the, same, product, name, but, having, a, different, concentration, may, not, only, differ, in, their, dilutions, but, actually, use, different, perfume, oil, mixtures, altogether, for, instance, in, order, to, make, the, edt, version, of, a, fragrance, brighter, and, fresher, than, its, edp, the, edt, oil, may, be, tweaked, to, contain, slightly, more, top, notes, or, fewer, base, notes, chanel, no, 5, is, a, good, example, its, parfum, edp, edt, and, now, discontinued, edc, concentrations, are, in, fact, different, compositions, the, parfum, dates, to, 1921, the, edt, from, the, 1950s, and, the, edp, was, not, developed, until, the, 1980s, in, some, cases, words, such, as, extr, me, intense, or, concentr, e, that, might, indicate, a, higher, aromatic, concentration, are, actually, completely, different, fragrances, related, only, because, of, a, similar, perfume, accord, an, example, of, this, is, chanel, s, pour, monsieur, and, pour, monsieur, concentr, e, this, complexity, adds, a, layer, of, nuance, to, the, understanding, and, appreciation, of, perfumery, where, variations, in, concentration, and, formulation, can, significantly, alter, the, olfactory, the, sense, of, smell, experience, the, terms, perfume, and, cologne, lead, to, much, confusion, in, english, perfume, is, often, used, as, a, generic, overarching, term, to, refer, to, fragrances, marketed, to, women, regardless, of, their, exact, concentration, the, term, cologne, is, applied, to, those, sold, to, men, the, actual, product, worn, by, a, woman, may, be, an, eau, de, parfum, rather, than, an, extrait, or, by, a, man, an, eau, de, toilette, rather, than, an, eau, de, cologne, the, reasons, why, the, terms, perfume, and, cologne, are, often, used, in, a, generic, sense, is, related, to, the, modern, development, of, perfumery, in, europe, since, the, 18th, century, the, term, cologne, was, first, used, in, europe, in, the, 18th, century, to, refer, to, a, family, of, fresh, citrus, based, fragrances, distilled, using, extracts, from, citrus, floral, and, woody, ingredients, these, classical, colognes, were, supposedly, first, developed, in, cologne, germany, hence, the, name, this, type, of, cologne, which, is, still, in, production, describes, unisex, compositions, which, are, basically, citrus, blends, and, do, not, have, a, perfume, parent, examples, include, m, urer, wirtz, s, 4711, created, in, 1799, and, guerlain, s, eau, de, cologne, imp, riale, 1830, toilet, water, or, eau, de, toilette, referred, to, wide, range, of, scented, waters, not, otherwise, known, as, colognes, and, were, popular, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, term, perfume, emerged, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, first, fragrance, labeled, a, parfum, extract, with, a, high, concentration, of, aromatic, compounds, was, guerlain, s, jicky, in, 1889, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, fragrance, companies, began, offering, their, products, in, more, than, one, concentration, often, pairing, an, extrait, with, a, lighter, eau, de, toilette, suitable, for, day, wear, which, made, their, products, available, to, a, wider, range, of, customers, as, this, process, accelerated, perfume, houses, borrowed, the, term, cologne, to, refer, to, an, even, more, diluted, interpretation, of, their, fragrances, than, eau, de, toilette, guerlain, for, example, offered, an, eau, de, cologne, version, of, its, flagship, perfume, shalimar, and, many, of, its, other, fragrances, in, contrast, to, a, classical, eau, de, cologne, this, type, of, modern, cologne, is, a, lighter, less, concentrated, interpretation, of, a, more, concentrated, product, typically, a, pure, parfum, and, is, usually, the, lightest, concentration, from, a, line, of, fragrance, products, the, eau, de, parfum, concentration, and, terminology, is, the, most, recent, being, originally, developed, to, offer, the, radiance, of, an, edt, with, the, longevity, of, an, extrait, parfum, de, toilette, and, edp, began, to, appear, in, the, 1970s, and, gained, popularity, in, the, 1980s, in, the, 21st, century, edp, is, probably, the, most, widespread, strength, concentration, it, is, often, the, first, concentration, offered, when, a, new, fragrance, is, launched, and, usually, referred, to, generically, as, perfume, historically, women, s, fragrances, tended, to, have, higher, levels, of, aromatic, compounds, than, men, s, fragrances, fragrances, marketed, to, men, were, typically, sold, as, edt, or, edc, rarely, as, edp, or, perfume, extracts, this, is, changing, in, the, modern, fragrance, world, especially, as, fragrances, are, becoming, more, unisex, women, s, fragrances, used, to, be, common, in, all, levels, of, concentration, but, in, the, 21st, century, are, mainly, seen, in, edp, and, edt, concentrations, many, modern, perfumes, are, never, offered, in, extrait, or, eau, de, cologne, formulations, and, edp, and, edt, account, for, the, vast, majority, of, new, launches, perfume, oils, are, often, diluted, with, a, solvent, though, this, is, not, always, the, case, and, its, necessity, is, disputed, by, far, the, most, common, solvent, for, perfume, oil, dilution, is, alcohol, typically, a, mixture, of, ethanol, and, water, or, a, rectified, spirit, perfume, oil, can, also, be, diluted, by, means, of, neutral, smelling, oils, such, as, fractionated, coconut, oil, or, liquid, waxes, such, as, jojoba, oil, and, almond, oil, the, conventional, application, of, pure, perfume, parfum, extrait, in, western, cultures, is, behind, the, ears, at, the, nape, of, the, neck, under, the, armpits, and, at, the, insides, of, wrists, elbows, and, knees, so, that, the, pulse, point, will, warm, the, perfume, and, release, fragrance, continuously, according, to, perfumer, sophia, grojsman, behind, the, knees, is, the, ideal, point, to, apply, perfume, in, order, that, the, scent, may, rise, the, modern, perfume, industry, encourages, the, practice, of, layering, fragrance, so, that, it, is, released, in, different, intensities, depending, upon, the, time, of, the, day, lightly, scented, products, such, as, bath, oil, shower, gel, and, body, lotion, are, recommended, for, the, morning, eau, de, toilette, is, suggested, for, the, afternoon, and, perfume, applied, to, the, pulse, points, for, evening, cologne, fragrance, is, released, rapidly, lasting, around, 2, hours, eau, de, toilette, lasts, from, 2, to, 4, hours, while, perfume, may, last, up, to, six, hours, a, variety, of, factors, can, influence, how, fragrance, interacts, with, the, wearer, s, own, physiology, and, affect, the, perception, of, the, fragrance, diet, is, one, factor, as, eating, spicy, and, fatty, foods, can, increase, the, intensity, of, a, fragrance, the, use, of, medications, can, also, impact, the, character, of, a, fragrance, the, relative, dryness, of, the, wearer, s, skin, is, important, since, dry, skin, will, not, hold, fragrance, as, long, as, skin, with, more, oil, the, precise, formulae, of, commercial, perfumes, are, kept, secret, even, if, they, were, widely, published, they, would, be, dominated, by, such, complex, ingredients, and, odorants, that, they, would, be, of, little, use, in, providing, a, guide, to, the, general, consumer, in, description, of, the, experience, of, a, scent, nonetheless, connoisseurs, of, perfume, can, become, extremely, skillful, at, identifying, components, and, origins, of, scents, in, the, same, manner, as, wine, experts, the, most, practical, way, to, start, describing, a, perfume, is, according, to, the, elements, of, the, fragrance, notes, of, the, scent, or, the, family, it, belongs, to, all, of, which, affect, the, overall, impression, of, a, perfume, from, first, application, to, the, last, lingering, hint, of, scent, the, trail, of, scent, left, behind, by, a, person, wearing, perfume, is, called, its, sillage, after, the, french, word, for, wake, as, in, the, trail, left, by, a, boat, in, water, perfume, is, described, in, a, musical, metaphor, as, having, three, sets, of, notes, making, the, harmonious, scent, accord, the, notes, unfold, over, time, with, the, immediate, impression, of, the, top, note, leading, to, the, deeper, middle, notes, and, the, base, notes, gradually, appearing, as, the, final, stage, these, notes, are, created, carefully, with, knowledge, of, the, evaporation, process, of, the, perfume, the, scents, in, the, top, and, middle, notes, are, influenced, by, the, base, notes, conversely, the, scents, of, the, base, notes, will, be, altered, by, the, types, of, fragrance, materials, used, as, middle, notes, manufacturers, who, publish, perfume, notes, typically, do, so, with, the, fragrance, components, presented, as, a, fragrance, pyramid, using, imaginative, and, abstract, terms, for, the, components, listed, the, grouping, of, perfumes, can, never, be, completely, objective, or, definitive, many, fragrances, contain, aspects, of, different, families, even, a, perfume, designated, as, single, flower, will, have, subtle, undertones, of, other, aromatics, there, are, hardly, any, true, unitary, scent, perfumes, consisting, of, a, single, aromatic, material, the, family, classification, is, a, starting, point, to, describe, a, perfume, but, does, not, fully, characterize, it, the, traditional, categories, which, emerged, around, 1900, since, 1945, new, categories, have, emerged, to, describe, modern, scents, due, to, great, advances, in, the, technology, of, compound, design, and, synthesis, as, well, as, the, natural, development, of, styles, and, tastes, this, newer, classification, method, is, widely, used, in, retail, and, the, fragrance, industry, created, in, 1983, by, the, perfume, consultant, michael, edwards, the, new, scheme, simplifies, classification, and, naming, as, well, as, showing, the, relationships, among, the, classes, the, five, main, families, are, floral, oriental, woody, aromatic, foug, re, and, fresh, the, first, four, from, the, classic, terminology, and, the, last, from, the, modern, oceanic, category, each, of, these, are, divided, into, subgroups, and, arranged, around, a, wheel, in, this, scheme, chanel, no, 5, traditionally, classified, as, an, aldehydic, floral, is, placed, under, the, soft, floral, sub, group, while, amber, scents, are, within, the, oriental, group, chypre, perfumes, are, more, ambiguous, having, affinities, with, both, the, oriental, and, woody, families, for, instance, guerlain, mitsouko, is, under, mossy, woods, but, herm, s, rouge, a, more, floral, chypre, is, under, floral, oriental, plants, have, long, been, used, in, perfumery, as, a, source, of, essential, oils, and, aroma, compounds, these, aromatics, are, usually, secondary, metabolites, produced, by, plants, as, protection, against, herbivores, infections, as, well, as, to, attract, pollinators, plants, are, by, far, the, largest, source, of, fragrant, compounds, used, in, perfumery, the, sources, of, these, compounds, may, be, derived, from, various, parts, of, a, plant, a, plant, can, offer, more, than, one, source, of, aromatics, for, instance, the, aerial, portions, and, seeds, of, coriander, have, remarkably, different, odors, from, each, other, orange, leaves, blossoms, and, fruit, zest, are, the, respective, sources, of, petitgrain, neroli, and, orange, oils, many, modern, perfumes, contain, synthesized, odorants, synthetics, can, provide, fragrances, which, are, not, found, in, nature, for, instance, calone, a, compound, of, synthetic, origin, imparts, a, fresh, ozonous, metallic, marine, scent, that, is, widely, used, in, contemporary, perfumes, synthetic, aromatics, are, often, used, as, an, alternate, source, of, compounds, that, are, not, easily, obtained, from, natural, sources, for, example, linalool, and, coumarin, are, both, naturally, occurring, compounds, that, can, be, inexpensively, synthesized, from, terpenes, orchid, scents, typically, salicylates, are, usually, not, obtained, directly, from, the, plant, itself, but, are, instead, synthetically, created, to, match, the, fragrant, compounds, found, in, various, orchids, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, classes, of, synthetic, aromatics, by, far, are, the, white, musks, these, materials, are, found, in, all, forms, of, commercial, perfumes, as, a, neutral, background, to, the, middle, notes, these, musks, are, added, in, large, quantities, to, laundry, detergents, in, order, to, give, washed, clothes, a, lasting, clean, scent, the, majority, of, the, world, s, synthetic, aromatics, are, created, by, relatively, few, companies, they, include, each, of, these, companies, patents, several, processes, for, the, production, of, aromatic, synthetics, annually, natural, and, synthetics, are, used, for, their, different, odor, characteristics, in, perfumery, before, perfumes, can, be, composed, the, odorants, used, in, various, perfume, compositions, must, first, be, obtained, synthetic, odorants, are, produced, through, organic, synthesis, and, purified, odorants, from, natural, sources, require, the, use, of, various, methods, to, extract, the, aromatics, from, the, raw, materials, the, results, of, the, extraction, are, either, essential, oils, absolutes, concretes, or, butters, depending, on, the, amount, of, waxes, in, the, extracted, product, all, these, techniques, will, to, a, certain, extent, distort, the, odor, of, the, aromatic, compounds, obtained, from, the, raw, materials, this, is, due, to, the, use, of, heat, harsh, solvents, or, through, exposure, to, oxygen, in, the, extraction, process, which, will, denature, the, aromatic, compounds, which, either, change, their, odor, character, or, renders, them, odorless, although, fragrant, extracts, are, known, to, the, general, public, as, the, generic, term, essential, oils, a, more, specific, language, is, used, in, the, fragrance, industry, to, describe, the, source, purity, and, technique, used, to, obtain, a, particular, fragrant, extract, of, these, extracts, only, absolutes, essential, oils, and, tinctures, are, directly, used, to, formulate, perfumes, products, from, different, extraction, methods, are, known, under, different, names, even, though, their, starting, materials, are, the, same, for, instance, orange, blossoms, from, citrus, aurantium, that, have, undergone, solvent, extraction, produces, orange, blossom, absolute, but, that, which, have, been, steam, distilled, is, known, as, neroli, oil, perfume, compositions, are, an, important, part, of, many, industries, ranging, from, the, luxury, goods, sectors, food, services, industries, to, manufacturers, of, various, household, chemicals, the, purpose, of, using, perfume, or, fragrance, compositions, in, these, industries, is, to, affect, customers, through, their, sense, of, smell, and, entice, them, into, purchasing, the, perfume, or, perfumed, product, as, such, there, is, significant, interest, in, producing, a, perfume, formulation, that, people, will, find, aesthetically, pleasing, the, job, of, composing, perfumes, that, will, be, sold, is, left, up, to, an, expert, on, perfume, composition, or, known, in, the, fragrance, industry, as, the, perfumer, they, are, also, sometimes, referred, to, affectionately, as, a, nez, french, for, nose, due, to, their, fine, sense, of, smell, and, skill, in, smell, composition, the, composition, of, a, perfume, typically, begins, with, a, brief, by, the, perfumer, s, employer, or, an, outside, customer, the, customers, to, the, perfumer, or, their, employers, are, typically, fashion, houses, or, large, corporations, of, various, industries, the, perfumer, will, then, go, through, the, process, of, blending, multiple, perfume, mixtures, and, sell, the, formulation, to, the, customer, often, with, modifications, of, the, composition, of, the, perfume, the, perfume, composition, will, then, be, either, used, to, enhance, another, product, as, a, functional, fragrance, shampoos, make, up, detergents, car, interiors, etc, or, marketed, and, sold, directly, to, the, public, as, a, fine, fragrance, although, there, is, no, single, correct, technique, for, the, formulation, of, a, perfume, there, are, general, guidelines, as, to, how, a, perfume, can, be, constructed, from, a, concept, although, many, ingredients, do, not, contribute, to, the, smell, of, a, perfume, many, perfumes, include, colorants, and, antioxidants, to, improve, the, marketability, and, shelf, life, of, the, perfume, respectively, perfume, oils, usually, contain, tens, to, hundreds, of, ingredients, and, these, are, typically, organized, in, a, perfume, for, the, specific, role, they, will, play, these, ingredients, can, be, roughly, grouped, into, four, groups, the, top, middle, and, base, notes, of, a, fragrance, may, have, separate, primary, scents, and, supporting, ingredients, the, perfume, s, fragrance, oils, are, then, blended, with, ethyl, alcohol, and, water, aged, in, tanks, for, several, weeks, and, filtered, through, processing, equipment, to, respectively, allow, the, perfume, ingredients, in, the, mixture, to, stabilize, and, to, remove, any, sediment, and, particles, before, the, solution, can, be, filled, into, the, perfume, bottles, instead, of, building, a, perfume, from, ground, up, many, modern, perfumes, and, colognes, are, made, using, fragrance, bases, or, simply, bases, each, base, is, essentially, modular, perfume, that, is, blended, from, essential, oils, and, aromatic, chemicals, and, formulated, with, a, simple, concept, such, as, fresh, cut, grass, or, juicy, sour, apple, many, of, guerlain, s, aqua, allegoria, line, with, their, simple, fragrance, concepts, are, good, examples, of, what, perfume, fragrance, bases, are, like, the, effort, used, in, developing, bases, by, fragrance, companies, or, individual, perfumers, may, equal, that, of, a, marketed, perfume, since, they, are, useful, in, that, they, are, reusable, on, top, of, its, reusability, the, benefit, in, using, bases, for, construction, are, quite, numerous, creating, perfumes, through, reverse, engineering, with, analytical, techniques, such, as, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gc, ms, can, reveal, the, general, formula, for, any, particular, perfume, the, difficulty, of, gc, ms, analysis, arises, due, to, the, complexity, of, a, perfume, s, ingredients, this, is, particularly, due, to, the, presence, of, natural, essential, oils, and, other, ingredients, consisting, of, complex, chemical, mixtures, however, anyone, armed, with, good, gc, ms, equipment, and, experienced, in, using, this, equipment, can, today, within, days, find, out, a, great, deal, about, the, formulation, of, any, perfume, customers, and, competitors, can, analyze, most, perfumes, more, or, less, precisely, antique, or, badly, preserved, perfumes, undergoing, this, analysis, can, also, be, difficult, due, to, the, numerous, degradation, by, products, and, impurities, that, may, have, resulted, from, breakdown, of, the, odorous, compounds, ingredients, and, compounds, can, usually, be, ruled, out, or, identified, using, gas, chromatograph, gc, smellers, which, allow, individual, chemical, components, to, be, identified, both, through, their, physical, properties, and, their, scent, reverse, engineering, of, best, selling, perfumes, in, the, market, is, a, very, common, practice, in, the, fragrance, industry, due, to, the, relative, simplicity, of, operating, gc, equipment, the, pressure, to, produce, marketable, fragrances, and, the, highly, lucrative, nature, of, the, perfume, market, it, is, doubtful, whether, perfumes, qualify, as, appropriate, copyright, subject, matter, under, the, us, copyright, act, the, issue, has, not, yet, been, addressed, by, any, us, court, a, perfume, s, scent, is, not, eligible, for, trademark, protection, the, scent, serves, as, the, functional, purpose, of, the, product, in, 2006, the, dutch, supreme, court, granted, copyright, protection, to, lanc, me, s, perfume, tresor, lanc, me, v, kecofa, the, french, supreme, court, has, twice, taken, the, position, that, perfumes, lack, the, creativity, to, constitute, copyrightable, expressions, bsiri, barbir, v, haarman, reimer, 2006, beaute, prestige, international, v, senteur, mazal, 2008, sometimes, a, knock, off, perfume, would, use, an, altered, name, of, the, original, perfume, for, instance, now, discontinued, freya, by, oriflame, perfume, has, a, similar, designed, copy, produced, as, fre, yy, a, it, is, still, questionable, if, perfume, s, functional, purpose, can, be, protected, with, technical, patent, one, which, lasts, 15, years, apparently, russian, novaya, zarya, labels, their, colognes, as, hygienic, lotions, for, a, similar, reason, a, counterexample, novzar, s, more, than, century, old, shipr, chypre, and, troinoi, cologne, are, being, produced, by, other, companies, in, russia, in, similar, bottles, a, different, kind, of, copying, perfumes, is, known, in, ex, ussr, countries, as, literally, numbered, perfumery, a, number, making, company, with, perfumery, equipment, would, use, their, own, one, style, for, all, cheap, bottle, de, jure, labeling, a, knock, off, perfume, as, an, aroma, in, the, direction, of, or, a, version, of, certain, branded, perfume, this, way, the, production, costs, of, initially, cheap, scents, are, reduced, since, the, bottle, is, used, neither, for, plain, counterfeiting, nor, for, subtle, re, designing, the, questionable, part, of, numbered, perfumery, naming, is, the, idea, to, openly, mark, perfume, xxx, say, 105, as, either, type, or, version, or, literally, aroma, in, the, direction, of, of, a, well, known, perfum, in, small, online, bulk, however, in, purchases, over, 5000rub, a, whole, 100ml, bottle, of, such, perfume, or, 50ml, bottle, of, scent, oil, of, same, direction, costs, only, around, 6, eur, perfume, ingredients, regardless, of, natural, or, synthetic, origins, may, all, cause, health, or, environmental, problems, when, used, although, the, areas, are, under, active, research, much, remains, to, be, learned, about, the, effects, of, fragrance, on, human, health, and, the, environment, evidence, in, peer, reviewed, journals, shows, that, some, fragrances, can, cause, asthmatic, reactions, in, some, individuals, especially, those, with, severe, or, atopic, asthma, many, fragrance, ingredients, can, also, cause, headaches, allergic, skin, reactions, or, nausea, in, some, cases, an, excessive, use, of, perfumes, may, cause, allergic, reactions, of, the, skin, for, instance, acetophenone, ethyl, acetate, and, acetone, while, present, in, many, perfumes, are, also, known, or, potential, respiratory, allergens, nevertheless, this, may, be, misleading, since, the, harm, presented, by, many, of, these, chemicals, either, natural, or, synthetic, is, dependent, on, environmental, conditions, and, their, concentrations, in, a, perfume, for, instance, linalool, which, is, listed, as, an, irritant, causes, skin, irritation, when, it, degrades, to, peroxides, however, the, use, of, antioxidants, in, perfumes, or, reduction, in, concentrations, can, prevent, this, as, well, the, furanocoumarin, present, in, natural, extracts, of, grapefruit, or, celery, can, cause, severe, allergic, reactions, and, increase, sensitivity, to, ultraviolet, radiation, some, research, on, natural, aromatics, have, shown, that, many, contain, compounds, that, cause, skin, irritation, however, some, studies, such, as, ifra, s, research, claim, that, opoponax, is, too, dangerous, to, be, used, in, perfumery, still, lack, scientific, consensus, it, is, also, true, that, sometimes, inhalation, alone, can, cause, skin, irritation, a, number, of, national, and, international, surveys, have, identified, balsam, of, peru, often, used, in, perfumes, as, being, in, the, top, five, allergens, most, commonly, causing, patch, test, reactions, in, people, referred, to, dermatology, clinics, a, study, in, 2001, found, that, 3, 8, of, the, general, population, patch, tested, was, allergic, to, it, many, perfumes, contain, components, identical, to, balsam, of, peru, balsam, of, peru, is, used, as, a, marker, for, perfume, allergy, its, presence, in, a, cosmetic, is, denoted, by, the, inci, term, myroxylon, pereirae, balsam, of, peru, has, been, banned, by, the, international, fragrance, association, since, 1982, from, use, as, a, fragrance, compound, but, may, be, present, as, an, extract, or, distillate, in, other, products, where, mandatory, labelling, is, not, required, for, usage, of, 0, 4, or, less, there, is, scientific, evidence, that, nitro, musks, such, as, musk, xylene, could, cause, cancer, in, some, specific, animal, tests, these, reports, were, evaluated, by, the, eu, scientific, committee, for, consumer, safety, sccs, formerly, the, sccnfp, and, musk, xylene, was, found, to, be, safe, for, continued, use, in, cosmetic, products, it, is, in, fact, part, of, the, procedures, of, the, cosmetic, regulation, in, europe, that, materials, classified, as, carcinogens, require, such, a, safety, evaluation, by, the, authorities, to, be, allowed, in, cosmetic, consumer, products, although, other, ingredients, such, as, polycyclic, synthetic, musks, have, been, reported, to, be, positive, in, some, in, vitro, hormone, assays, these, reports, have, been, reviewed, by, various, authorities, for, example, for, one, of, the, main, polycyclic, musks, galaxolide, hhcb, these, reviews, include, those, of, the, eu, scientific, committee, on, consumer, safety, the, eu, s, priority, substances, review, the, eu, scientific, committee, on, health, and, environmental, risk, and, more, recently, also, the, us, epa, the, outcome, of, all, of, these, reviews, over, the, past, decade, or, so, is, that, there, are, no, safety, concerns, for, human, health, reviews, with, similar, positive, outcomes, also, exist, for, another, main, polycyclic, musk, ahtn, for, instance, on, its, safe, use, in, cosmetics, by, the, eu, many, natural, aromatics, such, as, oakmoss, absolutes, basil, oil, rose, oil, and, many, others, contain, allergens, or, carcinogenic, compounds, the, safety, of, which, is, either, governed, by, regulations, e, g, allowed, methyl, eugenol, levels, in, the, eu, cosmetics, regulation, entry, 102, annex, iii, of, the, eu, cosmetics, regulation, or, through, various, limitations, set, by, the, international, fragrance, association, synthetic, musks, are, pleasant, in, smell, and, relatively, inexpensive, as, such, they, are, often, employed, in, large, quantities, to, cover, the, unpleasant, scent, of, laundry, detergents, and, many, personal, cleaning, products, due, to, their, large, scale, use, several, types, of, synthetic, musks, have, been, found, in, human, fat, and, milk, as, well, as, in, the, sediments, and, waters, of, the, great, lakes, these, pollutants, may, pose, additional, health, and, environmental, problems, when, they, enter, human, and, animal, diets, the, demands, for, aromatic, materials, such, as, sandalwood, agarwood, and, musk, have, led, to, the, endangerment, of, these, species, as, well, as, illegal, trafficking, and, harvesting, the, us, fda, controls, the, safety, of, perfumes, through, their, ingredients, and, requires, that, they, be, tested, to, the, extent, that, they, are, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, due, to, the, need, for, protection, of, trade, secrets, companies, rarely, give, the, full, listing, of, ingredients, regardless, of, their, effects, on, health, in, the, eu, as, from, 11, march, 2005, the, mandatory, listing, of, a, set, of, 26, recognized, fragrance, allergens, was, enforced, the, requirement, to, list, these, materials, is, dependent, on, the, intended, use, of, the, final, product, the, limits, above, which, the, allergens, are, required, to, be, declared, are, 0, 001, for, products, intended, to, remain, on, the, skin, and, 0, 01, for, those, intended, to, be, rinsed, off, this, has, resulted, in, many, old, perfumes, like, chypres, and, foug, re, classes, which, traditionally, make, use, of, oakmoss, extract, being, reformulated, fragrance, compounds, in, perfumes, will, degrade, or, break, down, if, improperly, stored, in, the, presence, of, heat, light, oxygen, and, extraneous, organic, materials, proper, preservation, of, perfumes, involves, keeping, them, away, from, sources, of, heat, and, storing, them, where, they, will, not, be, exposed, to, light, an, opened, bottle, will, keep, its, aroma, intact, for, several, years, as, long, as, it, is, well, stored, however, the, presence, of, oxygen, in, the, head, space, of, the, bottle, and, environmental, factors, will, in, the, long, run, alter, the, smell, of, the, fragrance, perfumes, are, best, preserved, when, kept, in, light, tight, aluminium, bottles, or, in, their, original, packaging, when, not, in, use, and, refrigerated, to, relatively, low, temperatures, between, 3, 7, c, 37, 45, f, although, it, is, difficult, to, completely, remove, oxygen, from, the, headspace, of, a, stored, flask, of, fragrance, opting, for, spray, dispensers, instead, of, rollers, and, open, bottles, will, minimize, oxygen, exposure, sprays, also, have, the, advantage, of, isolating, fragrance, inside, a, bottle, and, preventing, it, from, mixing, with, dust, skin, and, detritus, which, would, degrade, and, alter, the, quality, of, a, perfume, there, exist, several, archives, and, museums, devoted, to, the, preservation, of, historical, perfumes, namely, the, osmoth, que, which, stocks, over, 3, 000, perfumes, from, the, past, two, millennia, in, their, original, formulations, all, scents, in, their, collection, are, preserved, in, non, actinic, glass, flasks, flushed, with, argon, gas, stored, in, thermally, insulated, compartments, maintained, at, 12, c, 54, f, in, a, large, vault
