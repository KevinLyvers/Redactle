food, is, any, substance, consumed, by, an, organism, for, nutritional, support, food, is, usually, of, plant, animal, or, fungal, origin, and, contains, essential, nutrients, such, as, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or, minerals, the, substance, is, ingested, by, an, organism, and, assimilated, by, the, organism, s, cells, to, provide, energy, maintain, life, or, stimulate, growth, different, species, of, animals, have, different, feeding, behaviours, that, satisfy, the, needs, of, their, metabolisms, and, have, evolved, to, fill, a, specific, ecological, niche, within, specific, geographical, contexts, omnivorous, humans, are, highly, adaptable, and, have, adapted, to, obtain, food, in, many, different, ecosystems, humans, generally, use, cooking, to, prepare, food, for, consumption, the, majority, of, the, food, energy, required, is, supplied, by, the, industrial, food, industry, which, produces, food, through, intensive, agriculture, and, distributes, it, through, complex, food, processing, and, food, distribution, systems, this, system, of, conventional, agriculture, relies, heavily, on, fossil, fuels, which, means, that, the, food, and, agricultural, systems, are, one, of, the, major, contributors, to, climate, change, accounting, for, as, much, as, 37, of, total, greenhouse, gas, emissions, the, food, system, has, significant, impacts, on, a, wide, range, of, other, social, and, political, issues, including, sustainability, biological, diversity, economics, population, growth, water, supply, and, food, security, food, safety, and, security, are, monitored, by, international, agencies, like, the, international, association, for, food, protection, the, world, resources, institute, the, world, food, programme, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, and, the, international, food, information, council, food, is, any, substance, consumed, to, provide, nutritional, support, and, energy, to, an, organism, it, can, be, raw, processed, or, formulated, and, is, consumed, orally, by, animals, for, growth, health, or, pleasure, food, is, mainly, composed, of, water, lipids, proteins, and, carbohydrates, minerals, e, g, salts, and, organic, substances, e, g, vitamins, can, also, be, found, in, food, plants, algae, and, some, microorganisms, use, photosynthesis, to, make, some, of, their, own, nutrients, water, is, found, in, many, foods, and, has, been, defined, as, a, food, by, itself, water, and, fiber, have, low, energy, densities, or, calories, while, fat, is, the, most, energy, dense, component, some, inorganic, non, food, elements, are, also, essential, for, plant, and, animal, functioning, human, food, can, be, classified, in, various, ways, either, by, related, content, or, by, how, it, is, processed, the, number, and, composition, of, food, groups, can, vary, most, systems, include, four, basic, groups, that, describe, their, origin, and, relative, nutritional, function, vegetables, and, fruit, cereals, and, bread, dairy, and, meat, studies, that, look, into, diet, quality, group, food, into, whole, grains, cereals, refined, grains, cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy, products, fish, red, meat, processed, meat, and, sugar, sweetened, beverages, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, and, world, health, organization, use, a, system, with, nineteen, food, classifications, cereals, roots, pulses, and, nuts, milk, eggs, fish, and, shellfish, meat, insects, vegetables, fruits, fats, and, oils, sweets, and, sugars, spices, and, condiments, beverages, foods, for, nutritional, uses, food, additives, composite, dishes, and, savoury, snacks, in, a, given, ecosystem, food, forms, a, web, of, interlocking, chains, with, primary, producers, at, the, bottom, and, apex, predators, at, the, top, other, aspects, of, the, web, include, detrovores, that, eat, detritis, and, decomposers, that, break, down, dead, organisms, primary, producers, include, algae, plants, bacteria, and, protists, that, acquire, their, energy, from, sunlight, primary, consumers, are, the, herbivores, that, consume, the, plants, and, secondary, consumers, are, the, carnivores, that, consume, those, herbivores, some, organisms, including, most, mammals, and, birds, diet, consists, of, both, animals, and, plants, and, they, are, considered, omnivores, the, chain, ends, with, the, apex, predators, the, animals, that, have, no, known, predators, in, its, ecosystem, humans, are, considered, apex, predators, humans, are, omnivores, finding, sustenance, in, vegetables, fruits, cooked, meat, milk, eggs, mushrooms, and, seaweed, cereal, grain, is, a, staple, food, that, provides, more, food, energy, worldwide, than, any, other, type, of, crop, corn, maize, wheat, and, rice, account, for, 87, of, all, grain, production, worldwide, just, over, half, of, the, world, s, crops, are, used, to, feed, humans, 55, percent, with, 36, percent, grown, as, animal, feed, and, 9, percent, for, biofuels, fungi, and, bacteria, are, also, used, in, the, preparation, of, fermented, foods, like, bread, wine, cheese, and, yogurt, during, photosynthesis, energy, from, the, sun, is, absorbed, and, used, to, transform, water, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, air, or, soil, into, oxygen, and, glucose, the, oxygen, is, then, released, and, the, glucose, stored, as, an, energy, reserve, photosynthetic, plants, algae, and, certain, bacteria, often, represent, the, lowest, point, of, the, food, chains, making, photosynthesis, the, primary, source, of, energy, and, food, for, nearly, all, life, on, earth, plants, also, absorb, important, nutrients, and, minerals, from, the, air, natural, waters, and, soil, carbon, oxygen, and, hydrogen, are, absorbed, from, the, air, or, water, and, are, the, basic, nutrients, needed, for, plant, survival, the, three, main, nutrients, absorbed, from, the, soil, for, plant, growth, are, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, with, other, important, nutrients, including, calcium, sulfur, magnesium, iron, boron, chlorine, manganese, zinc, copper, molybdenum, and, nickel, bacteria, and, other, microorganisms, also, form, the, lower, rungs, of, the, food, chain, they, obtain, their, energy, from, photosynthesis, or, by, breaking, down, dead, organisms, waste, or, chemical, compounds, some, form, symbiotic, relationships, with, other, organisms, to, obtain, their, nutrients, bacteria, provide, a, source, of, food, for, protozoa, who, in, turn, provide, a, source, of, food, for, other, organisms, such, as, small, invertebrates, other, organisms, that, feed, on, bacteria, include, nematodes, fan, worms, shellfish, and, a, species, of, snail, in, the, marine, environment, plankton, which, includes, bacteria, archaea, algae, protozoa, and, microscopic, fungi, provide, a, crucial, source, of, food, to, many, small, and, large, aquatic, organisms, without, bacteria, life, would, scarcely, exist, because, bacteria, convert, atmospheric, nitrogen, into, nutritious, ammonia, ammonia, is, the, precursor, to, proteins, nucleic, acids, and, most, vitamins, since, the, advent, of, industrial, process, for, nitrogen, fixation, the, haber, bosch, process, the, majority, of, ammonia, in, the, world, is, human, made, plants, as, a, food, source, are, divided, into, seeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, and, nuts, where, plants, fall, within, these, categories, can, vary, with, botanically, described, fruits, such, as, the, tomato, squash, pepper, and, eggplant, or, seeds, like, peas, commonly, considered, vegetables, food, is, a, fruit, if, the, part, eaten, is, derived, from, the, reproductive, tissue, so, seeds, nuts, and, grains, are, technically, fruit, from, a, culinary, perspective, fruits, are, generally, considered, the, remains, of, botanically, described, fruits, after, grains, nuts, seeds, and, fruits, used, as, vegetables, are, removed, grains, can, be, defined, as, seeds, that, humans, eat, or, harvest, with, cereal, grains, oats, wheat, rice, corn, barley, rye, sorghum, and, millet, belonging, to, the, poaceae, grass, family, and, pulses, coming, from, the, fabaceae, legume, family, whole, grains, are, foods, that, contain, all, the, elements, of, the, original, seed, bran, germ, and, endosperm, nuts, are, dry, fruits, distinguishable, by, their, woody, shell, fleshy, fruits, distinguishable, from, dry, fruits, like, grain, seeds, and, nuts, can, be, further, classified, as, stone, fruits, cherries, and, peaches, pome, fruits, apples, pears, berries, blackberry, strawberry, citrus, oranges, lemon, melons, watermelon, cantaloupe, mediterranean, fruits, grapes, fig, tropical, fruits, banana, pineapple, vegetables, refer, to, any, other, part, of, the, plant, that, can, be, eaten, including, roots, stems, leaves, flowers, bark, or, the, entire, plant, itself, these, include, root, vegetables, potatoes, and, carrots, bulbs, onion, family, flowers, cauliflower, and, broccoli, leaf, vegetables, spinach, and, lettuce, and, stem, vegetables, celery, and, asparagus, the, carbohydrate, protein, and, lipid, content, of, plants, is, highly, variable, carbohydrates, are, mainly, in, the, form, of, starch, fructose, glucose, and, other, sugars, most, vitamins, are, found, from, plant, sources, with, exceptions, of, vitamin, d, and, vitamin, b, 12, minerals, can, also, be, plentiful, or, not, fruit, can, consist, of, up, to, 90, water, contain, high, levels, of, simple, sugars, that, contribute, to, their, sweet, taste, and, have, a, high, vitamin, c, content, compared, to, fleshy, fruit, excepting, bananas, vegetables, are, high, in, starch, potassium, dietary, fiber, folate, and, vitamins, and, low, in, fat, and, calories, grains, are, more, starch, based, and, nuts, have, a, high, protein, fibre, vitamin, e, and, b, content, seeds, are, a, good, source, of, food, for, animals, because, they, are, abundant, and, contain, fibre, and, healthful, fats, such, as, omega, 3, fats, complicated, chemical, interactions, can, enhance, or, depress, bioavailability, of, certain, nutrients, phytates, can, prevent, the, release, of, some, sugars, and, vitamins, animals, that, only, eat, plants, are, called, herbivores, with, those, that, mostly, just, eat, fruits, known, as, frugivores, leaves, while, shoot, eaters, are, folivores, pandas, and, wood, eaters, termed, xylophages, termites, frugivores, include, a, diverse, range, of, species, from, annelids, to, elephants, chimpanzees, and, many, birds, about, 182, fish, consume, seeds, or, fruit, animals, domesticated, and, wild, use, as, many, types, of, grasses, that, have, adapted, to, different, locations, as, their, main, source, of, nutrients, humans, eat, thousands, of, plant, species, there, may, be, as, many, as, 75, 000, edible, species, of, angiosperms, of, which, perhaps, 7, 000, are, often, eaten, plants, can, be, processed, into, breads, pasta, cereals, juices, and, jams, or, raw, ingredients, such, as, sugar, herbs, spices, and, oils, can, be, extracted, oilseeds, are, pressed, to, produce, rich, oils, sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed, including, canola, oil, and, sesame, many, plants, and, animals, have, coevolved, in, such, a, way, that, the, fruit, is, a, good, source, of, nutrition, to, the, animal, who, then, excretes, the, seeds, some, distance, away, allowing, greater, dispersal, even, seed, predation, can, be, mutually, beneficial, as, some, seeds, can, survive, the, digestion, process, insects, are, major, eaters, of, seeds, with, ants, being, the, only, real, seed, dispersers, birds, although, being, major, dispersers, only, rarely, eat, seeds, as, a, source, of, food, and, can, be, identified, by, their, thick, beak, that, is, used, to, crack, open, the, seed, coat, mammals, eat, a, more, diverse, range, of, seeds, as, they, are, able, to, crush, harder, and, larger, seeds, with, their, teeth, animals, are, used, as, food, either, directly, or, indirectly, this, includes, meat, eggs, shellfish, and, dairy, products, like, milk, and, cheese, they, are, an, important, source, of, protein, and, are, considered, complete, proteins, for, human, consumption, as, they, contain, all, the, essential, amino, acids, that, the, human, body, needs, one, 4, ounce, 110, g, steak, chicken, breast, or, pork, chop, contains, about, 30, grams, of, protein, one, large, egg, has, 7, grams, of, protein, a, 4, ounce, 110, g, serving, of, cheese, has, about, 15, grams, of, protein, and, 1, cup, of, milk, has, about, 8, grams, of, protein, other, nutrients, found, in, animal, products, include, calories, fat, essential, vitamins, including, b12, and, minerals, including, zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium, food, products, produced, by, animals, include, milk, produced, by, mammary, glands, which, in, many, cultures, is, drunk, or, processed, into, dairy, products, cheese, butter, etc, eggs, laid, by, birds, and, other, animals, are, eaten, and, bees, produce, honey, a, reduced, nectar, from, flowers, that, is, used, as, a, popular, sweetener, in, many, cultures, some, cultures, consume, blood, such, as, in, blood, sausage, as, a, thickener, for, sauces, or, in, a, cured, salted, form, for, times, of, food, scarcity, and, others, use, blood, in, stews, such, as, jugged, hare, animals, specifically, humans, typically, have, five, different, types, of, tastes, sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and, umami, the, differing, tastes, are, important, for, distinguishing, between, foods, that, are, nutritionally, beneficial, and, those, which, may, contain, harmful, toxins, as, animals, have, evolved, the, tastes, that, provide, the, most, energy, are, the, most, pleasant, to, eat, while, others, are, not, enjoyable, although, humans, in, particular, can, acquire, a, preference, for, some, substances, which, are, initially, unenjoyable, water, while, important, for, survival, has, no, taste, sweetness, is, almost, always, caused, by, a, type, of, simple, sugar, such, as, glucose, or, fructose, or, disaccharides, such, as, sucrose, a, molecule, combining, glucose, and, fructose, sourness, is, caused, by, acids, such, as, vinegar, in, alcoholic, beverages, sour, foods, include, citrus, specifically, lemons, and, limes, sour, is, evolutionarily, significant, as, it, can, signal, a, food, that, may, have, gone, rancid, due, to, bacteria, saltiness, is, the, taste, of, alkali, metal, ions, such, as, sodium, and, potassium, it, is, found, in, almost, every, food, in, low, to, moderate, proportions, to, enhance, flavor, bitter, taste, is, a, sensation, considered, unpleasant, characterised, by, having, a, sharp, pungent, taste, unsweetened, dark, chocolate, caffeine, lemon, rind, and, some, types, of, fruit, are, known, to, be, bitter, umami, commonly, described, as, savory, is, a, marker, of, proteins, and, characteristic, of, broths, and, cooked, meats, foods, that, have, a, strong, umami, flavor, include, cheese, meat, and, mushrooms, while, most, animals, taste, buds, are, located, in, their, mouth, some, insects, taste, receptors, are, located, on, their, legs, and, some, fish, have, taste, buds, along, their, entire, body, dogs, cats, and, birds, have, relatively, few, taste, buds, chickens, have, about, 30, adult, humans, have, between, 2000, and, 4000, while, catfish, can, have, more, than, a, million, herbivores, generally, have, more, than, carnivores, as, they, need, to, tell, which, plants, may, be, poisonous, not, all, mammals, share, the, same, tastes, some, rodents, can, taste, starch, cats, cannot, taste, sweetness, and, several, carnivores, including, hyenas, dolphins, and, sea, lions, have, lost, the, ability, to, sense, up, to, four, of, the, five, taste, modalities, found, in, humans, food, is, broken, into, nutrient, components, through, digestive, process, proper, digestion, consists, of, mechanical, processes, chewing, peristalsis, and, chemical, processes, digestive, enzymes, and, microorganisms, the, digestive, systems, of, herbivores, and, carnivores, are, very, different, as, plant, matter, is, harder, to, digest, carnivores, mouths, are, designed, for, tearing, and, biting, compared, to, the, grinding, action, found, in, herbivores, herbivores, however, have, comparatively, longer, digestive, tracts, and, larger, stomachs, to, aid, in, digesting, the, cellulose, in, plants, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, about, 600, million, people, worldwide, get, sick, and, 420, 000, die, each, year, from, eating, contaminated, food, diarrhea, is, the, most, common, illness, caused, by, consuming, contaminated, food, with, about, 550, million, cases, and, 230, 000, deaths, from, diarrhea, each, year, children, under, five, years, of, age, account, for, 40, of, the, burden, of, foodborne, illness, with, 125, 000, deaths, each, year, a, 2003, world, health, organization, who, report, concluded, that, about, 30, of, reported, food, poisoning, outbreaks, in, the, who, european, region, occur, in, private, homes, according, to, the, who, and, cdc, in, the, usa, alone, annually, there, are, 76, million, cases, of, foodborne, illness, leading, to, 325, 000, hospitalizations, and, 5, 000, deaths, from, 2011, to, 2016, on, average, there, were, 668, 673, cases, of, foodborne, illness, and, 21, deaths, each, year, in, addition, during, this, period, 1, 007, food, poisoning, outbreaks, with, 30, 395, cases, of, food, poisoning, were, reported
