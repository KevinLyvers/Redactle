the, discus, throw, pronunciation, also, known, as, disc, throw, is, a, track, and, field, sport, in, which, the, participant, athlete, throws, an, oblate, spheroid, weight, called, a, discus, in, an, attempt, to, mark, a, farther, distance, than, other, competitors, it, is, an, ancient, sport, as, demonstrated, by, the, fifth, century, bc, myron, statue, discobolus, although, not, part, of, the, current, pentathlon, it, was, one, of, the, events, of, the, ancient, greek, pentathlon, which, can, be, dated, back, to, at, least, 708, bc, and, it, is, part, of, the, modern, decathlon, the, sport, of, throwing, the, discus, traces, back, to, it, being, an, event, in, the, original, olympic, games, of, ancient, greece, the, discus, as, a, sport, was, resurrected, in, magdeburg, germany, by, gymnastics, teacher, christian, georg, kohlrausch, and, his, students, in, the, 1870s, organized, men, s, competition, was, resumed, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, has, been, a, part, of, the, modern, summer, olympic, games, since, the, first, modern, competition, the, 1896, summer, olympics, images, of, discus, throwers, figured, prominently, in, advertising, for, early, modern, games, such, as, fundraising, stamps, for, the, 1896, games, and, the, main, posters, for, the, 1920, and, 1948, summer, olympics, today, the, sport, of, discus, is, a, routine, part, of, modern, track, and, field, meets, at, all, levels, and, retains, a, particularly, iconic, place, in, the, olympic, games, the, first, modern, athlete, to, throw, the, discus, while, rotating, the, whole, body, was, franti, ek, janda, suk, from, bohemia, the, present, czech, republic, janda, suk, invented, this, technique, when, studying, the, position, of, the, famous, statue, of, discobolus, after, only, one, year, of, developing, the, technique, he, earned, a, silver, medal, in, the, 1900, olympics, women, s, competition, began, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, following, competition, at, national, and, regional, levels, it, was, added, to, the, olympic, program, for, the, 1928, games, the, event, consists, of, throwing, a, heavy, disc, with, the, weight, or, size, depending, on, the, competitor, men, and, women, throw, different, sized, discs, with, varying, sizes, and, weights, depending, on, age, the, weight, of, the, discus, is, either, governed, by, world, athletics, for, international, or, usa, track, field, for, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, henry, canine, advocated, for, a, lighter, weight, discus, in, high, school, competition, his, suggestion, was, adopted, by, the, national, high, school, athletic, association, in, 1938, the, typical, discus, has, sides, made, of, plastic, wood, fiberglass, carbon, fiber, or, metal, with, a, metal, rim, and, a, metal, core, to, attain, the, weight, the, rim, must, be, smooth, with, no, roughness, or, finger, holds, a, discus, with, more, weight, in, the, rim, produces, greater, angular, momentum, for, any, given, spin, rate, and, thus, more, stability, although, it, is, more, difficult, to, throw, however, a, higher, rim, weight, if, thrown, correctly, can, lead, to, a, longer, throw, in, some, competitions, a, solid, rubber, discus, is, used, see, in, the, united, states, to, make, a, throw, the, competitor, starts, in, a, circle, of, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, 1, 4, in, diameter, which, is, recessed, in, a, concrete, pad, by, 20, millimetres, 0, 79, in, the, thrower, typically, takes, an, initial, stance, facing, away, from, the, direction, of, the, throw, they, then, spin, anticlockwise, for, right, handers, 1, 1, 2, times, while, staying, within, the, circle, to, build, momentum, before, releasing, the, discus, the, discus, must, land, within, a, 34, 92, circular, sector, that, is, centered, on, the, throwing, circle, the, rules, of, competition, for, discus, are, virtually, identical, to, those, of, shot, put, except, that, the, circle, is, larger, a, stop, board, is, not, used, and, there, are, no, form, rules, concerning, how, the, discus, is, to, be, thrown, the, basic, motion, is, a, fore, handed, sidearm, movement, the, discus, is, spun, off, the, index, finger, or, the, middle, finger, of, the, throwing, hand, in, flight, the, disc, spins, clockwise, when, viewed, from, above, for, a, right, handed, thrower, and, anticlockwise, for, a, left, handed, thrower, as, well, as, achieving, maximum, momentum, in, the, discus, on, throwing, the, discus, distance, is, also, determined, by, the, trajectory, the, thrower, imparts, as, well, as, the, aerodynamic, behavior, of, the, discus, generally, throws, into, a, moderate, headwind, achieve, the, maximum, distance, also, a, faster, spinning, discus, imparts, greater, gyroscopic, stability, the, technique, of, discus, throwing, is, quite, difficult, to, master, and, needs, much, experience, to, perfect, thus, most, top, throwers, are, 30, years, old, or, more, the, discus, throw, is, sometimes, contested, indoors, but, it, is, not, included, at, the, world, athletics, indoor, championships, world, athletics, used, to, keep, world, indoor, best, discus, records, but, since, 2023, they, now, combine, both, indoor, and, outdoor, marks, the, discus, technique, can, be, broken, down, into, phases, the, purpose, is, to, transfer, from, the, back, to, the, front, of, the, throwing, circle, while, turning, through, one, and, a, half, circles, the, speed, of, delivery, is, high, and, speed, is, built, up, during, the, throw, slow, to, fast, correct, technique, involves, the, buildup, of, torque, so, that, maximum, force, can, be, applied, to, the, discus, on, delivery, initially, the, thrower, takes, up, their, position, in, the, throwing, circle, distributing, their, body, weight, evenly, over, both, feet, which, are, roughly, shoulder, width, apart, they, crouch, in, order, to, adopt, a, more, efficient, posture, to, start, from, whilst, also, isometrically, preloading, their, muscles, this, will, allow, them, to, start, faster, and, achieve, a, more, powerful, throw, they, then, begin, the, wind, up, which, sets, the, tone, for, the, entire, throw, the, rhythm, of, the, wind, up, and, throw, is, very, important, focusing, on, rhythm, can, bring, about, the, consistency, to, get, in, the, right, positions, that, many, throwers, lack, executing, a, sound, discus, throw, with, solid, technique, requires, perfect, balance, this, is, due, to, the, throw, being, a, linear, movement, combined, with, a, one, and, a, half, rotation, and, an, implement, at, the, end, of, one, arm, thus, a, good, discus, thrower, needs, to, maintain, balance, within, the, circle, for, a, right, handed, thrower, the, next, stage, is, to, move, the, weight, over, the, left, foot, from, this, position, the, right, foot, is, raised, and, the, athlete, runs, across, the, circle, there, are, various, techniques, for, this, stage, where, the, leg, swings, out, to, a, small, or, great, extent, some, athletes, turn, on, their, left, heel, e, g, ilke, wylluda, but, turning, on, the, ball, of, the, foot, is, far, more, common, the, aim, is, to, land, in, the, power, position, the, right, foot, should, be, in, the, center, and, the, heel, should, not, touch, the, ground, at, any, point, the, left, foot, should, land, very, quickly, after, the, right, weight, should, be, mostly, over, the, back, foot, with, as, much, torque, as, possible, in, the, body, so, the, right, arm, is, high, and, far, back, this, is, very, hard, to, achieve, the, critical, stage, is, the, delivery, of, the, discus, from, this, power, position, the, hips, drive, through, hard, and, will, be, facing, the, direction, of, the, throw, on, delivery, athletes, employ, various, techniques, to, control, the, end, point, and, recover, from, the, throw, such, as, fixing, feet, to, pretty, much, stop, dead, or, an, active, reverse, spinning, onto, the, left, foot, e, g, virgilijus, alekna, sports, scientist, richard, ganslen, researched, the, aerodynamics, of, the, discus, reporting, the, discus, will, stall, at, an, angle, of, 29, the, discus, throw, has, been, the, subject, of, a, number, of, well, known, ancient, greek, statues, and, roman, copies, such, as, the, discobolus, and, discophoros, the, discus, throw, also, appears, repeatedly, in, ancient, greek, mythology, featured, as, a, means, of, manslaughter, in, the, cases, of, hyacinth, crocus, phocus, and, acrisius, and, as, a, named, event, in, the, funeral, games, of, patroclus, discus, throwers, have, been, selected, as, a, main, motif, in, numerous, collectors, coins, one, of, the, recent, samples, is, the, 10, greek, discus, commemorative, coin, minted, in, 2003, to, commemorate, the, 2004, summer, olympics, on, the, obverse, of, the, coin, a, modern, athlete, is, seen, in, the, foreground, in, a, half, turned, position, while, in, the, background, an, ancient, discus, thrower, has, been, captured, in, a, lively, bending, motion, with, the, discus, high, above, his, head, creating, a, vivid, representation, of, the, sport
