a, gladiator, latin, gladiator, swordsman, from, gladius, sword, was, an, armed, combatant, who, entertained, audiences, in, the, roman, republic, and, roman, empire, in, violent, confrontations, with, other, gladiators, wild, animals, and, condemned, criminals, some, gladiators, were, volunteers, who, risked, their, lives, and, their, legal, and, social, standing, by, appearing, in, the, arena, most, were, despised, as, slaves, schooled, under, harsh, conditions, socially, marginalized, and, segregated, even, in, death, irrespective, of, their, origin, gladiators, offered, spectators, an, example, of, rome, s, martial, ethics, and, in, fighting, or, dying, well, they, could, inspire, admiration, and, popular, acclaim, they, were, celebrated, in, high, and, low, art, and, their, value, as, entertainers, was, commemorated, in, precious, and, commonplace, objects, throughout, the, roman, world, the, origin, of, gladiatorial, combat, is, open, to, debate, there, is, evidence, of, it, in, funeral, rites, during, the, punic, wars, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, thereafter, it, rapidly, became, an, essential, feature, of, politics, and, social, life, in, the, roman, world, its, popularity, led, to, its, use, in, ever, more, lavish, and, costly, games, the, gladiator, games, lasted, for, nearly, a, thousand, years, reaching, their, peak, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, the, 2nd, century, ad, christians, disapproved, of, the, games, because, they, involved, idolatrous, pagan, rituals, and, the, popularity, of, gladatorial, contests, declined, in, the, fifth, century, leading, to, their, disappearance, early, literary, sources, seldom, agree, on, the, origins, of, gladiators, and, the, gladiator, games, in, the, late, 1st, century, bc, nicolaus, of, damascus, believed, they, were, etruscan, a, generation, later, livy, wrote, that, they, were, first, held, in, 310, bc, by, the, campanians, in, celebration, of, their, victory, over, the, samnites, long, after, the, games, had, ceased, the, 7th, century, ad, writer, isidore, of, seville, derived, latin, lanista, manager, of, gladiators, from, the, etruscan, word, for, executioner, and, the, title, of, charon, an, official, who, accompanied, the, dead, from, the, roman, gladiatorial, arena, from, charun, psychopomp, of, the, etruscan, underworld, this, was, accepted, and, repeated, in, most, early, modern, standard, histories, of, the, games, for, some, modern, scholars, reappraisal, of, pictorial, evidence, supports, a, campanian, origin, or, at, least, a, borrowing, for, the, games, and, gladiators, campania, hosted, the, earliest, known, gladiator, schools, ludi, tomb, frescoes, from, the, campanian, city, of, paestum, 4th, century, bc, show, paired, fighters, with, helmets, spears, and, shields, in, a, propitiatory, funeral, blood, rite, that, anticipates, early, roman, gladiator, games, compared, to, these, images, supporting, evidence, from, etruscan, tomb, paintings, is, tentative, and, late, the, paestum, frescoes, may, represent, the, continuation, of, a, much, older, tradition, acquired, or, inherited, from, greek, colonists, of, the, 8th, century, bc, livy, places, the, first, roman, gladiator, games, 264, bc, in, the, early, stage, of, rome, s, first, punic, war, against, carthage, when, decimus, junius, brutus, scaeva, had, three, gladiator, pairs, fight, to, the, death, in, rome, s, cattle, market, forum, forum, boarium, to, honor, his, dead, father, brutus, pera, livy, describes, this, as, a, munus, plural, munera, a, gift, in, this, case, a, commemorative, duty, owed, the, manes, spirit, or, shade, of, a, dead, ancestor, by, his, descendants, the, development, of, the, gladiator, munus, and, its, gladiator, types, was, most, strongly, influenced, by, samnium, s, support, for, hannibal, and, the, subsequent, punitive, expeditions, against, the, samnites, by, rome, and, its, campanian, allies, the, earliest, most, frequently, mentioned, and, probably, most, popular, type, was, the, samnite, the, war, in, samnium, immediately, afterwards, was, attended, with, equal, danger, and, an, equally, glorious, conclusion, the, enemy, besides, their, other, warlike, preparation, had, made, their, battle, line, to, glitter, with, new, and, splendid, arms, there, were, two, corps, the, shields, of, the, one, were, inlaid, with, gold, of, the, other, with, silver, the, romans, had, already, heard, of, these, splendid, accoutrements, but, their, generals, had, taught, them, that, a, soldier, should, be, rough, to, look, on, not, adorned, with, gold, and, silver, but, putting, his, trust, in, iron, and, in, courage, the, dictator, as, decreed, by, the, senate, celebrated, a, triumph, in, which, by, far, the, finest, show, was, afforded, by, the, captured, armour, so, the, romans, made, use, of, the, splendid, armour, of, their, enemies, to, do, honour, to, their, gods, while, the, campanians, in, consequence, of, their, pride, and, in, hatred, of, the, samnites, equipped, after, this, fashion, the, gladiators, who, furnished, them, entertainment, at, their, feasts, and, bestowed, on, them, the, name, samnites, livy, s, account, skirts, the, funereal, sacrificial, function, of, early, roman, gladiator, combats, and, reflects, the, later, theatrical, ethos, of, the, roman, gladiator,

a, morally, instructive, form, of, historic, enactment, in, which, the, only, honourable, option, for, the, gladiator, was, to, fight, well, or, else, die, well, in, 216, bc, marcus, aemilius, lepidus, late, consul, and, augur, was, honoured, by, his, sons, with, three, days, of, gladiatora, munera, in, the, forum, romanum, using, twenty, two, pairs, of, gladiators, ten, years, later,

of, gladiatoria, munera, by, rome, s, iberian, allies, shows, how, easily, and, how, early, the, culture, of, the, gladiator, munus, permeated, places, far, from, rome, itself, by, 174, bc, small, roman, munera, private, or, public, provided, by, an, editor, of, relatively, low, importance, may, have, been, so, commonplace, and, unremarkable, they, were, not, considered, worth, recording, many,

which, lasted, four, days, and, was, accompanied, by, a, public, distribution, of, meats, a, banquet, and, scenic, performances, the, climax, of, the, show, which, was, big, for, the, time, was, that, in, three, days, seventy, four, gladiators, fought, in, 105, bc, the, ruling, consuls, offered, rome, its, first, taste, of, state, sponsored, barbarian, combat, demonstrated, by, gladiators, from,

on, the, imperial, purse, from, which, the, roman, empire, never, quite, recovered, and, lesser, magistrates, found, their, provision, of, various, obligatory, munera, an, increasingly, unrewarding, tax, on, the, doubtful, privileges, of, office, still, emperors, continued, to, subsidize, the, games, as, a, matter, of, undiminished, public, interest, in, the, early, 3rd, century, ad, the,

advertisement, of, their, personal, generosity, and, a, part, purchase, of, their, office, bigger, games, were, put, on, by, senior, magistrates, who, could, better, afford, them, the, largest, and, most, lavish, of, all, were, paid, for, by, the, emperor, himself, the, earliest, types, of, gladiator, were, named, after, rome, s, enemies, of, that, time, the, samnite, thracian, and, gaul, the, samnite, heavily, armed, elegantly, helmed, and, probably, the, most, popular, type, was, renamed, secutor, and, the, gaul, renamed, murmillo, once, these, former, enemies, had, been, conquered, then, absorbed, into, rome, s, empire, in, the, mid, republican, munus, each, type, seems, to, have, fought, against, a, similar, or, identical, type, in, the, later, republic, and, early, empire, various, fantasy, types, were, introduced, and, were, set, against, dissimilar, but, complementary, types, for, example, the, bareheaded, nimble, retiarius, net, man, armoured, only, at, the, left, arm, and,

this, the, senate, decreed, that, whenever, any, public, show, was, given, anywhere, the, first, row, of, seats, should, be, reserved, for, senators, and, at, rome, he, would, not, allow, the, envoys, of, the, free, and, allied, nations, to, sit, in, the, orchestra, since, he, was, informed, that, even, freedmen, were, sometimes, appointed, he, separated, the, soldiery, from, the, people, he,

a, dark, cloak, should, sit, in, the, middle, of, the, house, he, would, not, allow, women, to, view, even, the, gladiators, except, from, the, upper, seats, though, it, had, been, the, custom, for,
