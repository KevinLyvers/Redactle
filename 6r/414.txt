brazilian, jiu, jitsu, also, abbreviated, as, bjj, portuguese, jiu, jitsu, brasileiro, is, a, self, defence, martial, art, and, combat, sport, based, on, grappling, ground, fighting, and, submission, holds, bjj, is, primarily, a, ground, based, fighting, style, and, focuses, on, taking, one, s, opponent, down, to, the, ground, gaining, a, dominant, position, and, using, a, number, of, techniques, to, force, them, into, submission, via, joint, locks, chokeholds, or, compression, locks, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, was, first, developed, around, 1925, by, brazilian, brothers, carlos, oswaldo, gast, o, jr, and, h, lio, gracie, after, carlos, was, taught, kodokan, judo, by, a, travelling, japanese, judoka, mitsuyo, maeda, in, 1917, later, on, the, gracie, family, developed, their, own, self, defense, system, which, they, named, gracie, jiu, jitsu, bjj, eventually, came, to, be, its, own, defined, combat, sport, through, the, innovations, practices, and, adaptation, of, gracie, jiu, jitsu, and, judo, and, has, become, one, of, the, essential, martial, arts, for, modern, mma, bjj, revolves, around, the, concept, that, a, smaller, weaker, person, can, successfully, defend, themselves, against, a, bigger, stronger, opponent, by, using, leverage, and, weight, distribution, taking, the, fight, to, the, ground, and, using, a, number, of, holds, and, submissions, to, defeat, them, sparring, commonly, referred, to, as, rolling, within, the, bjj, community, and, live, drilling, plays, a, major, role, in, the, practitioner, s, development, in, contrast, to, some, other, martial, arts, bjj, can, be, practiced, both, using, a, gi, uniform, or, not, which, is, know, as, no, gi, bjj, for, this, purpose, rash, guards, are, used, the, international, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, federation, ibjjf, is, the, main, governing, body, of, the, martial, art, establishing, the, rules, and, general, guidelines, as, well, as, promoting, competitions, and, training, of, referees, bjj, can, also, be, used, as, a, method, of, promoting, physical, fitness, building, character, and, as, a, way, of, life, mitsuyo, maeda, one, of, the, kodokan, s, top, groundwork, experts, trained, by, tomita, tsunejir, the, first, student, of, judo, s, founder, kano, jigoro, was, sent, overseas, to, demonstrate, and, spread, his, art, to, the, world, he, left, japan, in, 1904, and, visited, several, countries, giving, jiu, do, demonstrations, and, accepting, challenges, from, wrestlers, boxers, savate, fighters, and, various, other, martial, artists, and, arrived, in, brazil, on, 14, november, 1914, gast, o, gracie, was, a, business, partner, of, the, american, circus, in, bel, m, in, 1916, italian, argentine, circus, queirolo, brothers, staged, shows, there, and, presented, maeda, in, 1917, gast, o, s, eldest, son, carlos, gracie, watched, a, demonstration, of, kano, jiu, jitsu, judo, s, common, name, at, the, time, by, maeda, at, the, da, paz, theatre, and, decided, he, wanted, to, learn, maeda, accepted, him, as, a, pupil, at, his, school, overseen, by, jacintho, ferro, gracie, s, account, of, the, events, is, that, his, younger, sibling, h, lio, gracie, gradually, developed, gracie, jiu, jitsu, as, a, softer, pragmatic, adaptation, that, focused, more, on, the, ground, fighting, and, leverages, aspect, of, jiu, jitsu, judo, ne, waza, rather, than, the, throws, as, he, was, unable, to, perform, many, judo, throws, due, to, his, size, that, required, direct, opposition, to, an, opponent, s, strength, although, the, gracie, family, is, typically, recognized, as, the, main, family, to, first, promote, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, as, it, is, known, today, there, was, also, another, prominent, lineage, derived, from, maeda, via, another, brazilian, disciple, luiz, fran, a, this, lineage, had, been, represented, particularly, by, oswaldo, fadda, fadda, and, his, students, were, famous, for, defeating, the, gracies, in, a, gym, battle, and, by, the, influential, use, of, footlocks, the, lineage, still, survives, through, fadda, s, links, in, teams, such, as, nova, uni, o, and, grappling, fight, team, besides, fran, a, s, and, fadda, s, lineage, there, are, four, other, main, bjj, branches, in, brazil, gracie, humait, gracie, barra, carlson, gracie, jiu, jitsu, and, alliance, jiu, jitsu, each, branch, traces, its, roots, back, to, mitsuyo, maeda, the, name, jiu, jitsu, derives, from, an, older, romanization, of, its, original, spelling, in, the, west, the, modern, hepburn, romanization, of, is, j, jutsu, when, maeda, left, japan, judo, was, still, often, referred, to, as, kano, jiu, jitsu, or, even, more, generically, simply, as, jiu, jitsu, higashi, the, co, author, of, the, complete, kano, jiu, jitsu, judo, wrote, in, the, foreword, some, confusion, has, arisen, over, the, employment, of, the, term, jiudo, to, make, the, matter, clear, i, will, state, that, jiudo, is, the, term, selected, by, professor, kano, as, describing, his, system, more, accurately, than, jiu, jitsu, does, professor, kano, is, one, of, the, leading, educators, of, japan, and, it, is, natural, that, he, should, cast, about, for, the, technical, word, that, would, most, accurately, describe, his, system, but, the, japanese, people, generally, still, cling, to, the, more, popular, nomenclature, and, call, it, jiu, jitsu, outside, japan, however, this, distinction, was, noted, even, less, thus, when, maeda, and, satake, arrived, in, brazil, in, 1914, every, newspaper, announced, their, art, as, being, jiu, jitsu, despite, both, men, being, kodokan, judoka, it, was, not, until, 1925, that, the, japanese, government, itself, officially, mandated, that, the, correct, name, for, the, martial, art, taught, in, the, japanese, public, schools, should, be, judo, rather, than, jujutsu, in, brazil, the, art, is, still, called, jiu, jitsu, when, the, gracies, went, to, the, united, states, and, spread, jiu, jitsu, they, used, the, terms, gracie, jiu, jitsu, and, non, gracies, using, the, term, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, to, differentiate, from, the, already, present, styles, using, similar, sounding, names, in, a, 1994, interview, with, yoshinori, nishi, h, lio, gracie, said, that, he, did, not, even, know, the, word, judo, itself, until, the, sport, came, in, the, 1950s, to, brazil, because, he, heard, that, mitsuyo, maeda, called, his, style, jiu, jitsu, the, art, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, gracie, jiu, jitsu, gjj, a, name, trademarked, by, rorion, gracie, but, after, a, legal, dispute, with, his, cousin, carley, gracie, his, trademark, to, the, name, was, voided, other, members, of, the, gracie, family, often, call, their, style, by, personalized, names, such, as, ceaser, gracie, jiu, jitsu, or, renzo, gracie, jiu, jitsu, and, similarly, the, machado, family, call, their, style, machado, jiu, jitsu, mjj, while, each, style, and, its, instructors, have, their, own, unique, aspects, they, are, all, basic, variations, of, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, shares, many, techniques, with, the, original, kodokan, judo, especially, certain, styles, practiced, before, judo, became, part, of, the, olympics, such, as, kosen, judo, and, still, practiced, to, a, lesser, extent, as, well, as, with, the, earlier, ryu, school, of, jujutsu, because, of, this, some, practitioners, have, suggested, that, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, should, just, be, called, jiu, jitsu, certain, changes, were, made, to, the, rules, of, judo, after, it, was, introduced, to, brazil, some, of, these, rule, changes, sought, to, enhance, it, as, a, spectator, sport, and, to, improve, safety, several, of, these, rule, changes, de, emphasized, the, groundwork, aspects, of, judo, and, others, have, reduced, the, range, of, joint, locks, application, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, since, its, inception, did, not, strictly, follow, kodokan, judo, rules, this, divergence, helped, bjj, develop, a, distinct, identity, becoming, a, groundwork, and, submission, focus, fighting, style, this, difference, was, later, consolidated, with, the, creation, of, a, new, set, of, rules, that, guide, bjj, practice, today, even, though, bjj, uses, and, allows, many, of, the, techniques, found, in, judo, and, jujutsu, the, evolution, of, these, techniques, in, bjj, has, followed, a, distinct, path, giving, primary, emphasis, to, ground, fighting, positions, and, maneuvers, and, having, the, guard, as, the, central, working, point, of, the, fight, this, is, reflected, on, how, different, fighting, techniques, are, scored, in, competition, in, bjj, positions, such, as, the, rear, mount, receive, a, higher, score, and, the, focus, of, the, fight, is, to, establish, a, dominant, position, against, the, adversary, on, the, ground, and, submit, them, using, chokeholds, or, joint, locks, by, contrast, in, judo, throwing, techniques, are, scored, higher, and, can, give, a, direct, victory, if, executed, correctly, the, goal, of, the, fight, is, to, sweep, or, throw, the, opponent, to, the, ground, to, win, bjj, also, allows, heelhooks, and, knee, reaping, which, are, prohibited, in, judo, and, any, takedowns, used, in, wrestling, sambo, or, other, grappling, arts, including, direct, attempts, to, take, down, by, touching, the, legs, or, dragging, the, opponent, to, the, ground, spinal, locks, and, cervical, locks, are, not, allowed, in, gi, jiu, jitsu, amateur, mma, multiple, forms, of, no, gi, jiu, jitsu, judo, and, other, martial, arts, due, to, potential, to, cause, serious, bodily, injury, bjj, also, has, become, more, sports, oriented, in, recent, years, prohibiting, techniques, such, as, slams, another, divergence, of, bjj, from, judo, and, jujutsu, is, that, the, first, allows, no, gi, practice, and, competition, with, its, own, subset, of, rules, use, of, holds, and, takedowns, from, wrestling, and, other, grappling, styles, is, common, in, no, gi, bjj, and, strikes, may, also, be, used, when, the, competition, rules, permit, such, as, the, open, palm, strike, in, cjj, combat, jiu, jitsu, in, 1972, carlos, gracie, moved, to, the, united, states, to, teach, jiu, jitsu, and, in, 1978, was, followed, by, rorion, gracie, who, co, founded, the, ultimate, fighting, championship, ufc, in, 1993, jiu, jitsu, came, to, international, prominence, in, martial, arts, circles, when, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, expert, royce, gracie, won, the, first, second, and, fourth, ultimate, fighting, championships, which, at, the, time, were, single, elimination, martial, arts, tournaments, royce, fought, successfully, against, several, larger, opponents, proficient, in, other, fighting, styles, including, boxing, shootfighting, muay, thai, karate, wrestling, and, taekwondo, bjj, has, since, become, an, elementary, aspect, of, mma, revealing, the, importance, of, ground, fighting, in, a, fight, sport, bjj, tournaments, continue, to, grow, in, popularity, and, have, given, rise, to, no, gi, submission, grappling, tournaments, such, as, the, adcc, submission, wrestling, world, championship, and, naga, the, north, american, grappling, association, sport, bjj, has, also, become, a, popular, method, of, fitness, around, the, world, in, recent, years, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, focuses, on, getting, an, opponent, to, the, ground, in, order, to, neutralize, possible, strength, or, size, advantages, through, ground, fighting, techniques, and, submission, holds, involving, joint, locks, and, chokeholds, on, the, ground, physical, strength, can, be, offset, or, enhanced, through, proper, grappling, techniques, bjj, employs, a, wide, range, of, takedown, techniques, to, bring, an, opponent, to, the, ground, such, as, pulling, guard, which, is, not, used, in, other, combat, sports, such, as, judo, or, wrestling, once, the, opponent, is, on, the, ground, a, number, of, manoeuvres, and, counter, manoeuvres, are, available, to, manipulate, the, opponent, into, a, suitable, position, for, the, application, of, a, submission, technique, achieving, a, dominant, position, on, the, ground, is, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, bjj, which, includes, effective, use, of, the, guard, position, to, defend, oneself, from, bottom, using, both, submissions, and, sweeps, with, sweeps, leading, to, the, possibility, of, dominant, position, or, an, opportunity, to, pass, the, guard, and, passing, the, guard, to, dominate, from, top, position, with, side, control, mount, and, back, mount, positions, this, system, of, manoeuvring, and, manipulation, can, be, likened, to, a, form, of, kinetic, or, physical, chess, when, executed, by, two, experienced, practitioners, a, submission, hold, in, bjj, is, often, likened, to, the, equivalent, of, checkmate, where, the, opponent, is, left, with, no, other, option, but, to, tap, be, injured, or, choked, renzo, gracie, wrote, in, his, book, mastering, jujitsu, the, classical, jujutsu, of, old, japan, appeared, to, have, no, common, strategy, to, guide, a, combatant, over, the, course, of, a, fight, indeed, this, was, one, of, kano, s, most, fundamental, and, perceptive, criticisms, of, the, classical, program, maeda, not, only, taught, the, art, of, judo, to, carlos, gracie, but, also, taught, a, particular, philosophy, about, the, nature, of, combat, developed, by, kano, and, further, refined, by, maeda, based, on, his, worldwide, travels, competing, against, fighters, skilled, in, a, wide, variety, of, martial, arts, the, book, details, maeda, s, theory, as, arguing, that, physical, combat, could, be, broken, down, into, distinct, phases, such, as, the, striking, phase, the, grappling, phase, the, ground, phase, etc, thus, it, was, a, smart, fighter, s, task, to, keep, the, fight, located, in, the, phase, of, combat, best, suited, to, his, own, strengths, renzo, gracie, stated, that, this, was, a, fundamental, influence, of, the, gracie, approach, to, combat, these, strategies, were, further, developed, over, time, by, the, gracie, family, among, others, and, became, prominent, in, contemporary, mma, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, is, mainly, differentiated, from, other, martial, arts, by, its, greater, emphasis, on, ground, fighting, bjj, places, less, emphasis, on, standing, techniques, such, as, striking, and, throws, although, takedowns, score, points, and, the, rules, allows, for, a, diverse, range, of, techniques, such, as, single, double, leg, takedowns, or, foot, sweeps, some, bjj, practitioners, also, cross, train, with, wrestling, judo, and, sambo, as, bjj, focuses, on, submissions, sparring, and, live, drilling, rolling, become, the, most, essential, part, of, the, training, regime, this, type, of, training, allows, practitioners, to, practice, at, full, speed, and, with, full, strength, resembling, the, effort, made, in, a, competition, training, methods, include, drills, in, which, techniques, are, practiced, against, a, non, resisting, and, resisting, partners, isolation, sparring, commonly, referred, to, as, positional, drilling, where, only, a, certain, technique, or, sets, of, techniques, are, used, and, full, sparring, where, each, practitioner, tries, to, submit, their, opponent, through, technique, physical, conditioning, is, also, an, important, aspect, of, training, the, gracie, family, lineage, descended, from, helio, gracie, focuses, on, practical, applications, of, bjj, that, apply, primarily, to, self, defense, they, will, often, run, development, drills, in, which, a, person, is, surrounded, by, a, circle, of, other, students, who, will, attempt, to, attack, the, defending, student, who, in, turn, must, defend, themselves, using, techniques, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, gyms, typically, follow, a, set, of, ground, rules, to, instill, trust, respect, and, cleanliness, amongst, students, common, practices, include, once, on, the, ground, the, bjj, practitioner, strives, to, take, a, dominant, or, controlling, position, from, where, to, apply, submissions, these, positions, provide, different, submission, or, transition, options, in, side, control, the, practitioner, pins, his, opponent, to, the, ground, from, the, side, of, their, torso, the, top, grappler, lies, across, the, opponent, with, weight, applied, to, the, opponent, s, chest, the, opponent, may, be, further, controlled, by, pressure, on, either, side, of, the, shoulders, and, hips, from, the, practitioner, s, elbows, shoulders, and, knees, a, wide, variety, of, submissions, can, be, initiated, from, side, control, it, is, also, referred, to, as, the, side, mount, and, cem, quilos, a, hundred, kilograms, in, brazilian, portuguese, additionally, the, typical, side, mount, increases, opportunity, for, the, top, grappler, to, advance, to, other, dominant, positions, this, position, is, often, used, in, mma, as, it, allows, the, top, fighter, to, strike, whilst, overcoming, their, opponents, defense, there, are, many, variants, of, the, side, control, position, including, kesa, gatame, standard, side, control, reverse, side, control, and, other, positions, the, knee, on, belly, position, is, a, modified, side, pin, that, is, distinctly, separated, from, the, side, control, position, the, knee, on, belly, position, is, characterized, primarily, by, the, control, of, the, opponent, with, one, leg, out, for, base, and, balance, and, the, other, leg, positioned, across, the, opponent, s, torso, pinning, them, to, the, ground, this, form, of, pin, is, a, mobile, pin, rather, than, a, static, pin, and, is, considered, a, more, dominant, position, in, many, grappling, formats, the, knee, on, belly, position, is, worth, additional, points, because, it, provides, a, greater, striking, platform, than, traditional, side, control, and, is, closer, to, achieving, the, more, ideal, mounted, position, in, the, mount, or, full, mount, position, the, practitioner, sits, astride, the, opponent, s, front, torso, or, chest, controlling, the, opponent, with, his, bodyweight, and, hips, in, the, strongest, form, of, this, position, the, practitioner, works, his, knees, into, the, opponent, s, armpits, to, reduce, arm, movements, and, ability, to, move, or, counter, submission, attempts, full, mount, can, be, used, to, apply, a, variety, of, submissions, including, armlocks, or, chokes, when, taking, the, back, mount, position, often, known, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, as, the, back, grab, or, attacking, the, back, the, practitioner, attaches, to, the, back, of, the, opponent, by, wrapping, his, legs, around, and, hooking, the, opponent, s, thighs, with, their, heel, or, locking, in, a, body, triangle, by, crossing, one, shin, across, the, waist, like, a, belt, then, placing, the, back, of, the, opposing, knee, over, the, instep, as, if, finishing, a, triangle, choke, simultaneously, the, upper, body, is, controlled, by, wrapping, the, arms, around, the, chest, or, neck, of, the, opponent, this, position, is, often, used, to, apply, chokeholds, as, well, as, arm, bars, and, triangles, and, neutralizes, an, opponent, s, potential, size, or, strength, advantage, the, north, south, position, occurs, when, a, practitioner, is, lying, on, their, back, on, the, ground, and, their, opponent, is, lying, on, top, with, the, head, over, the, chest, area, and, controlling, the, bottom, practitioner, s, arms, as, with, most, top, controlling, positions, in, bjj, the, top, practitioner, applies, pressure, by, bringing, their, hips, downwards, towards, the, ground, generating, what, is, referred, to, as, dead, weight, there, are, several, submissions, and, transitions, that, are, possible, from, the, north, south, position, most, commonly, the, north, south, choke, north, south, kimura, and, others, when, in, the, guard, position, the, practitioner, is, on, their, back, controlling, an, opponent, with, his, legs, the, bottom, practitioner, pushes, and, pulls, with, the, legs, or, feet, to, unbalance, and, limit, the, movements, of, his, opponent, this, position, allows, practitioners, a, wide, variety, of, counter, attacks, from, the, bottom, position, including, submissions, and, sweeps, the, three, most, common, types, of, guards, include, the, closed, guard, half, guard, and, open, guard, in, closed, guard, the, bottom, grappler, has, his, legs, around, the, opponent, s, hips, with, ankles, closed, together, to, control, their, opponent, the, closed, guard, can, be, an, effective, position, this, guard, allows, many, setups, for, submissions, such, as, joint, locks, and, chokes, as, well, as, sweeps, in, the, open, guard, the, legs, are, not, hooked, together, and, the, bottom, grappler, uses, his, legs, or, feet, to, push, or, pull, their, opponent, there, are, many, variations, of, open, guard, with, distinct, names, and, positioning, including, the, butterfly, guard, de, la, riva, guard, x, guard, k, guard, rubber, guard, spider, guard, octopus, guard, lapel, guard, worm, guard, made, popular, by, keenan, cornelius, and, others, butterfly, guard, is, when, the, bottom, grappler, brings, his, legs, up, and, feet, together, against, the, inner, thighs, of, top, opponent, the, name, is, derived, from, the, resulting, butterfly, wing, shape, butterfly, guard, increases, both, space, to, maneuver, and, the, ability, to, counter, the, opponent, with, the, shins, or, arches, of, the, feet, against, the, competitor, s, inner, thighs, spider, guard, is, when, the, bottom, grappler, puts, one, or, two, of, his, feet, on, his, opponents, arms, this, guard, is, effective, at, keeping, control, on, the, bottom, and, can, be, used, to, set, up, sweeps, or, submissions, in, the, half, guard, one, of, the, top, grappler, s, legs, is, controlled, by, the, bottom, grappler, s, legs, preventing, the, top, opponent, from, passing, side, control, or, full, mount, positions, there, is, also, a, variant, of, half, guard, called, 50, 50, guard, which, consist, of, each, opponent, usually, in, sitting, positions, with, one, of, their, legs, hooking, the, same, leg, of, their, opponent, in, a, mirrored, fashion, this, position, is, called, 50, 50, because, neither, opponent, has, a, distinct, advantage, where, both, sides, have, the, same, possibilities, of, sweeps, and, attacks, another, variation, of, the, half, guard, position, is, the, deep, half, guard, which, involves, the, bottom, grappler, positioning, themselves, underneath, their, opponent, grabbing, the, top, grappler, s, thigh, this, gives, the, individual, on, the, bottom, the, opportunity, to, sweep, their, opponent, and, end, up, on, a, more, dominant, top, position, this, position, was, popularized, by, american, bjj, black, belt, jeff, glover, the, de, la, riva, guard, dlr, is, an, open, guard, technique, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, named, after, the, renowned, competitor, ricardo, de, la, riva, while, not, an, entirely, new, concept, in, grappling, as, it, had, origins, in, nonatei, style, judo, credited, to, oda, tsunetane, it, gained, prominence, through, de, la, riva, s, use, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, the, dlr, guard, is, identified, when, a, competitor, lies, on, their, back, controlling, their, opponent, with, open, legs, this, position, is, defined, by, one, leg, hooking, outside, the, opponent, s, leg, e, g, the, guard, player, s, left, leg, hooking, the, passer, s, right, leg, thereby, compromising, the, passer, s, balance, this, outside, hook, is, what, distinguishes, the, dlr, guard, from, other, open, guards, the, de, la, riva, guard, is, pivotal, in, modern, jiu, jitsu, serving, as, a, foundation, for, many, advanced, guard, techniques, developed, since, its, introduction, wrestling, freestyle, greco, roman, american, folkstyle, collegiate, and, others, are, having, an, impact, on, technique, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, whereas, bjj, focuses, on, positional, points, and, submissions, wrestling, focuses, on, the, shoulder, pin, wrestling, techniques, such, as, single, leg, and, double, leg, take, downs, pins, and, attacks, on, turtle, guard, have, made, their, way, into, competitive, bjj, particularly, as, no, gi, competitions, have, gained, popularity, the, majority, of, submission, holds, can, be, grouped, into, two, broad, categories, joint, locks, and, chokes, joint, locks, typically, involve, isolating, an, opponent, s, limb, and, creating, a, lever, with, the, body, position, which, will, force, the, joint, to, move, past, its, normal, range, of, motion, pressure, is, increased, in, a, controlled, manner, and, released, if, the, opponent, cannot, escape, the, hold, and, signals, defeat, by, tapping, a, choke, hold, can, disrupt, the, blood, supply, to, the, brain, and, cause, unconsciousness, if, the, opponent, does, not, tap, when, required, see, also, compression, lock, a, less, common, type, of, submission, hold, is, a, compression, lock, where, the, muscle, of, an, opponent, is, compressed, against, a, hard, large, bone, commonly, the, shin, or, wrist, causing, significant, pain, to, the, opponent, these, types, of, locks, are, not, usually, allowed, in, competition, due, to, the, high, risk, of, tearing, muscle, tissue, this, type, of, lock, also, often, hyper, extends, the, joint, in, the, opposite, direction, pulling, it, apart, some, compression, locks, include, the, achilles, lock, biceps, slicer, and, leg, slicer, or, calf, slicer, while, many, joint, locks, are, permitted, in, bjj, most, competitions, ban, or, restrict, some, or, all, joint, locks, that, involve, the, knees, ankles, and, spine, the, reason, for, this, is, that, the, angles, of, manipulation, required, to, cause, pain, are, nearly, the, same, as, those, that, would,

material, with, tighter, cuffs, on, the, pants, and, jacket, this, allows, the, practitioner, to, benefit, from, a, closer, fit, providing, less, material, for, an, opponent, to, manipulate, traditionally, to, be, promoted, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, the, wearing, of, the, jiu, jitsu, gi, while, training, is, a, requirement, recently, with, the, growing, popularity, of, no, gi, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, has, the, practice, of, giving, out, belts, to, no, gi, practitioners, e, g, rolles, gracie, awarding, rashad, evans, a, black, belt, has, become, more, common, there, are, certain, differences, between, gi, jiu, jitsu, and, no, gi, jiu, jitsu, in, gi, jiu, jitsu, one, can, grip, an, opponent, s, uniform, using, it, to, submit, or, advance, position, there, are, a, number, of,

usually, wear, a, rash, guard, and, mma, shorts, or, spats, the, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, ranking, system, awards, a, practitioner, different, coloured, belts, to, signify, increasing, levels, of, technical, knowledge, and, practical, skill, while, the, system, s, structure, shares, its, origins, with, the, judo, ranking, system, and, the, origins, of, all, coloured, belts, it, now, contains, many, of, its, own, unique, aspects, and, themes, some, of, these, differences, are, relatively, minor, such, as, the, division, between, youth, and, adult, belts, and, the, stripe, degree, system, others, are, quite, distinct, and, have, become, synonymous, with, the, art, such, as, a, higher, degree, of, informality, in, promotional, criteria, a, focus, on, competitive, demonstration, of, skill, and, a, conservative, approach, to, promotion, in, general, traditionally, the, concept, of, competitive, skill, demonstration, as, a, quickened, and, earned, route, of, promotion, holds, true, some, schools, have, placed, a, green, belt, for, adults, between, the, white, and, blue, belt, ranks, due, to, the, long, periods, between, advancement, in, addition, the, use, of, a, grey, belt, has, been, instituted, for, many, children, s, programs, to, signal, progress, between, the, white, and, yellow, belt, rankings, a, black, belt, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, commonly, takes, more, than, several, years, to, earn, and, the, rank, is, generally, considered, expert, level, the, amount, of, time, it, takes, to, achieve, the, rank, of, black, belt, varies, between, the, practitioner, some, notable, individuals, who, had, previous, backgrounds, in, other, martial, arts, have, been, promoted, directly, to, black, belt, rank, without, going, through, any, intermediate, rank, though, this, has, fallen, out, of, favour, in, recent, times, others, have, achieved, the, rank, in, relatively, short, time, frames, outside, of, exceptions, such, as, these, the, average, time, frame, is, around, 10, years, with, a, consistent, training, schedule, however, ryron, gracie, grandson, grandnephew, of, founders, h, lio, and, carlos, gracie, has, stated, that, the, average, of, 10, 12, years, is, longer, than, necessary, suggesting, that, the, ego, of, the, practitioner, often, hinders, progress, and, advancement, to, black, belt, should, take, about, 7, years, since, its, inception, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, has, had, different, registered, federations, and, tournaments, the, first, jiu, jitsu, federation, was, the, jiu, jitsu, federation, of, guanabara, which, has, remained, a, regional, federation, of, rio, de, janeiro, while, many, others, were, founded, among, the, most, prestigious, of, the, many, federations, are, the, sport, jiu, jitsu, international, federation, sjjif, a, nonprofit, organization, with, federations, and, tournaments, around, the, globe, with, the, mission, of, making, jiu, jitsu, an, olympic, sport, the, international, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, federation, a, for, profit, organization, that, hosts, a, number, of, tournaments, and, jjgf, founded, by, rickson, gracie, which, has, focus, on, both, bjj, as, self, defense, and, as, a, sport, the, weight, classes, for, bjj, competitions, can, differ, depending, on, the, organisation, that, is, promoting, the, event, the, ibjjf, weight, classes, are, the, most, commonly, used, under, the, ibjjf, rules, the, weight, classes, vary, by, age, sex, and, competition, type, gi, vs, nogi, while, there, are, numerous, local, and, regional, tournaments, administered, regularly, by, private, individuals, and, academies, there, are, two, major, entities, in, jiu, jitsu, circles, first, is, the, sport, jiu, jitsu, international, federation, sjjif, a, nonprofit, organization, with, international, federations, and, tournaments, second, is, the, international, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, federation, ibjjf, a, for, profit, company, that, hosts, a, number, of, major, tournaments, worldwide, these, include, the, pan, american, championship, european, championship, and, the, mundials, california, new, york, and, texas, are, the, three, states, in, the, us, which, host, tournaments, most, frequently, other, promotions, within, north, america, such, as, battleground, grappling, championship, american, grappling, federation, agf, north, american, bjj, federation, nabjjf, and, north, american, grappling, association, naga, host, tournaments, nationwide, but, visit, these, states, multiple, times, within, a, tournament, season, another, tournament, to, spring, from, the, founding, gracie, lineage, is, the, gracie, nationals, or, gracie, worlds, founded, in, 2007, by, rose, gracie, daughter, of, ultimate, fighting, championship, creator, and, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, grandmaster, rorion, gracie, gracie, nationals, worlds, followed, the, guidelines, of, other, major, tournaments, of, the, time, implementing, a, points, systems, in, 2012, the, gracie, worlds, introduced, a, new, submission, only, format, removing, certain, judging, systems, that, many, interpreted, as, an, outdated, scoring, system, rose, spoke, about, this, change, when, she, said, today, s, tournaments, aren, t, what, my, grandfather, envisioned, there, s, so, many, rules, that, it, takes, away, from, the, actual, art, of, jiu, jitsu, we, don, t, see, many, submissions, we, see, cheating, we, see, decisions, made, by, a, referee, we, need, to, stand, together, against, this, and, support, a, submission, only, kind, of, revolution, cheating, in, jiu, jitsu, rose, said, comes, in, many, forms, will, earn, a, point, then, hold, for, the, entire, match, so, they, can, win, with, that, one, little, advantage, they, got, at, the, start, rose, said, that, s, not, jiu, jitsu, that, s, cheating, mark, mcdonnell, from, gracie, botany, agrees, this, discontent, with, points, based, and, advantage, style, competition, has, been, echoed, throughout, the, jiu, jitsu, community, leading, to, many, prominent, submission, only, style, events, at, these, events, the, winner, of, a, match, is, determined, only, by, submission, and, these, tournaments, at, times, have, no, time, limit, or, are, timed, with, a, result, of, double, disqualification, if, there, is, no, submission, victory, this, form, of, tournament, have, yet, to, become, widespread, but, is, gaining, in, popularity, especially, amongst, mma, competitors, metamoris, a, grappling, competition, event, run, by, rose, s, brother, ralek, gracie, has, helped, advocate, this, tournament, form, another, notable, example, of, a, submission, only, format, is, the, ebi, eddie, bravo, invitational, which, was, the, first, televised, event, of, its, kind, and, is, now, being, featured, on, ufc, fight, pass, other, submission, only, events, have, cropped, up, all, over, the, world, including, tuff, invitational, polaris, pro, grappling, based, in, the, united, kingdom, submission, underground, backed, by, longtime, mma, star, chael, sonnen, and, the, quintet, promotion, devised, by, japanese, mma, legend, kazushi, sakuraba, and, based, around, teams, of, five, players, each, representing, a, different, gym, or, background, at, tournaments, especially, those, hosted, by, the, international, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, federation, ibjjf, some, athletes, engage, in, a, practice, called, closing, out, this, occurs, when, two, athletes, usually, friends, or, members, of, the, same, team, meet, in, a, match, but, refuse, to, fight, tournament, organizers, can, minimize, the, chance, of, close, outs, by, placing, athletes, from, the, same, team, on, opposite, sides, of, the, bracket, a, practice, which, makes, the, finals, the, only, match, in, which, they, could, possibly, meet, assuming, each, team, has, no, more, than, two, competitors, in, a, given, bracket, when, two, athletes, close, out, a, match, they, agree, which, one, of, them, will, technically, forfeit, to, the, other, as, this, most, often, occurs, in, the, final, matches, of, tournaments, this, usually, means, deciding, which, of, the, two, will, win, the, gold, medal, and, which, will, win, the, silver, notable, examples, of, closing, out, include, marcus, buchecha, almeida, forfeiting, the, finals, of, the, absolute, division, at, the, 2018, ibjjf, world, championship, to, his, friend, leandro, lo, who, had, suffered, a, shoulder, injury, during, a, previous, match, and, frequent, close, outs, between, the, brothers, paulo, and, joao, miyao, who, often, compete, in, the, same, weight, division, proponents, of, close, outs, claim, it, fosters, team, unity, and, allows, competitors, to, train, as, hard, and, as, freely, as, they, can, with, their, teammates, they, say, that, facing, a, teammate, in, a, competition, would, make, them, hold, back, in, training, critics, of, the, practice, say, it, diminishes, audience, enjoyment, of, tournaments, where, it, is, allowed, and, some, tournaments, notably, the, adcc, ban, it, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, is, one, of, the, safest, full, contact, martial, arts, its, injury, rate, is, around, 9, 39, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, this, is,

uses, grappling, instead, of, striking, the, few, injuries, that, may, be, incurred, in, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, usually, affect, the, joints, and, rarely, the, head, the, most, common, injuries, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, practitioners, suffer, from, are, acl, tears, rotator, cuff, tears, in, the, shoulders, and, spinal, disc, herniations, most, commonly, in, the, neck, region, many, are, repairable, via, surgery, that, require, an, extended, rehab, period, before, the, athlete, can, return, to, bjj, training, also, many, athletes, suffer, from, minor, injuries, such, as, elbow, finger, and, wrist, tendonitis, due, to, overtraining, and, the, grappling, nature, of, the, martial, art, which, can, be, strenuous, and, taxing, for, the, joints, and, the, tendons, besides, the, normal, strains, and, pulls, associated, with, most, martial, arts, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, practitioners, along, with, wrestlers, judoka, and, other, grapplers, are, exposed, to, regular, skin, abrasions, and, potential, unsanitary, mat, conditions, they, are, thus, at, higher, risk, for, developing, skin, disease, several, commonly, contracted, skin, diseases, include, ringworm, impetigo,
