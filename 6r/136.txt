tea, is, an, aromatic, beverage, prepared, by, pouring, hot, or, boiling, water, over, cured, or, fresh, leaves, of, camellia, sinensis, an, evergreen, shrub, native, to, east, asia, which, probably, originated, in, the, borderlands, of, southwestern, china, and, northern, myanmar, tea, is, also, made, but, rarely, from, the, leaves, of, camellia, taliensis, after, plain, water, tea, is, the, most, widely, consumed, drink, in, the, world, there, are, many, different, types, of, tea, some, have, a, cooling, slightly, bitter, and, astringent, flavour, while, others, have, profiles, that, include, sweet, nutty, floral, or, grassy, notes, tea, has, a, stimulating, effect, in, humans, primarily, due, to, its, caffeine, content, an, early, credible, record, of, tea, drinking, dates, to, the, third, century, ad, in, a, medical, text, written, by, chinese, physician, hua, tuo, it, was, popularised, as, a, recreational, drink, during, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, and, tea, drinking, subsequently, spread, to, other, east, asian, countries, portuguese, priests, and, merchants, introduced, it, to, europe, during, the, 16th, century, during, the, 17th, century, drinking, tea, became, fashionable, among, the, english, who, started, to, plant, tea, on, a, large, scale, in, british, india, the, term, herbal, tea, refers, to, drinks, not, made, from, camellia, sinensis, they, are, the, infusions, of, fruit, leaves, or, other, plant, parts, such, as, steeps, of, rosehip, chamomile, or, rooibos, these, may, be, called, tisanes, or, herbal, infusions, to, prevent, confusion, with, tea, made, from, the, tea, plant, the, etymology, of, the, various, words, for, tea, reflects, the, history, of, transmission, of, tea, drinking, culture, and, trade, from, china, to, countries, around, the, world, nearly, all, of, the, words, for, tea, worldwide, fall, into, three, broad, groups, te, cha, and, chai, present, in, english, as, tea, cha, or, char, and, chai, the, earliest, of, the, three, to, enter, english, is, cha, which, came, in, the, 1590s, via, the, portuguese, who, traded, in, macao, and, picked, up, the, cantonese, pronunciation, of, the, word, the, more, common, tea, form, arrived, in, the, 17th, century, via, the, dutch, who, acquired, it, either, indirectly, from, the, malay, teh, or, directly, from, the, t, pronunciation, in, min, chinese, the, third, form, chai, meaning, spiced, tea, originated, from, a, northern, chinese, pronunciation, of, cha, which, travelled, overland, to, central, asia, and, persia, where, it, picked, up, a, persian, ending, yi, the, chinese, word, for, tea, itself, was, likely, ultimately, derived, from, the, non, sinitic, languages, of, the, botanical, homeland, of, the, tea, plant, in, southwest, china, or, burma, possibly, from, an, archaic, austro, asiatic, root, word, la, meaning, leaf, tea, plants, are, native, to, east, asia, and, the, probable, center, of, origin, of, tea, is, near, the, source, of, the, irrawaddy, river, from, where, it, spread, out, fan, wise, into, southeast, china, indo, china, and, assam, thus, the, natural, home, of, the, tea, plant, is, considered, to, be, within, the, comparatively, small, fan, shaped, area, between, nagaland, manipur, and, mizoram, along, the, burma, frontier, in, the, west, through, china, as, far, as, the, zhejiang, province, in, the, east, and, from, this, line, generally, south, through, the, hills, to, burma, and, thailand, to, vietnam, the, west, east, axis, indicated, above, is, about, 2, 400, km, long, extending, from, longitude, 95, 120, e, the, north, south, axis, covers, about, 1, 920, km, starting, from, the, northern, part, of, burma, latitude, 29, n, passing, through, yunnan, tongkin, thailand, laos, and, on, to, annan, reaching, latitude, 11, n, chinese, small, leaf, type, tea, c, sinensis, var, sinensis, may, have, originated, in, southern, china, possibly, with, hybridization, of, unknown, wild, tea, relatives, however, since, there, are, no, known, wild, populations, of, this, tea, its, origin, is, speculative, given, their, genetic, differences, forming, distinct, clades, chinese, assam, type, tea, c, sinensis, var, assamica, may, have, two, different, parentages, one, being, found, in, southern, yunnan, xishuangbanna, pu, er, city, and, the, other, in, western, yunnan, lincang, baoshan, many, types, of, southern, yunnan, assam, tea, have, been, hybridized, with, the, closely, related, species, camellia, taliensis, unlike, southern, yunnan, assam, tea, western, yunnan, assam, tea, shares, many, genetic, similarities, with, indian, assam, type, tea, also, c, sinensis, var, assamica, thus, western, yunnan, assam, tea, and, indian, assam, tea, both, may, have, originated, from, the, same, parent, plant, in, the, area, where, southwestern, china, indo, burma, and, tibet, meet, however, as, the, indian, assam, tea, shares, no, haplotypes, with, western, yunnan, assam, tea, indian, assam, tea, is, likely, to, have, originated, from, an, independent, domestication, some, indian, assam, tea, appears, to, have, hybridized, with, the, species, camellia, pubicosta, assuming, a, generation, of, 12, years, chinese, small, leaf, tea, is, estimated, to, have, diverged, from, assam, tea, around, 22, 000, years, ago, while, chinese, assam, tea, and, indian, assam, tea, diverged, 2, 800, years, ago, the, divergence, of, chinese, small, leaf, tea, and, assam, tea, would, correspond, to, the, last, glacial, maximum, people, in, ancient, east, asia, ate, tea, for, centuries, perhaps, even, millennia, before, ever, consuming, it, as, a, beverage, they, would, nibble, on, the, leaves, raw, add, them, to, soups, or, greens, or, ferment, them, and, chew, them, as, areca, nut, is, chewed, tea, drinking, may, have, begun, in, the, region, of, yunnan, where, it, was, used, for, medicinal, purposes, it, is, believed, that, in, sichuan, people, began, to, boil, tea, leaves, for, consumption, into, a, concentrated, liquid, without, the, addition, of, other, leaves, or, herbs, thereby, using, tea, as, a, bitter, yet, stimulating, drink, rather, than, as, a, medicinal, concoction, chinese, legends, attribute, the, invention, of, tea, to, the, mythical, shennong, in, central, and, northern, china, in, 2737, bc, although, evidence, suggests, that, tea, drinking, may, have, been, introduced, from, the, southwest, of, china, sichuan, yunnan, area, the, earliest, written, records, of, tea, come, from, china, the, word, t, appears, in, the, shijing, and, other, ancient, texts, to, signify, a, kind, of, bitter, vegetable, and, it, is, possible, that, it, referred, to, many, different, plants, such, as, sow, thistle, chicory, or, smartweed, as, well, as, tea, in, the, chronicles, of, huayang, it, was, recorded, that, the, ba, people, in, sichuan, presented, tu, to, the, zhou, king, the, qin, later, conquered, the, state, of, ba, and, its, neighbour, shu, and, according, to, the, 17th, century, scholar, gu, yanwu, who, wrote, in, ri, zhi, lu, it, was, after, the, qin, had, taken, shu, that, they, learned, how, to, drink, tea, another, possible, early, reference, to, tea, is, found, in, a, letter, written, by, the, qin, dynasty, general, liu, kun, who, requested, that, some, real, tea, to, be, sent, to, him, the, earliest, known, physical, evidence, of, tea, was, discovered, in, 2016, in, the, mausoleum, of, emperor, jing, of, han, in, xi, an, indicating, that, tea, from, the, genus, camellia, was, drunk, by, han, dynasty, emperors, as, early, as, the, second, century, bc, the, han, dynasty, work, the, contract, for, a, youth, written, by, wang, bao, in, 59, bc, contains, the, first, known, reference, to, boiling, tea, among, the, tasks, listed, to, be, undertaken, by, the, youth, the, contract, states, that, he, shall, boil, tea, and, fill, the, utensils, and, he, shall, buy, tea, at, wuyang, the, first, record, of, tea, cultivation, is, dated, to, this, period, during, which, tea, was, cultivated, on, meng, mountain, near, chengdu, another, early, credible, record, of, tea, drinking, dates, to, the, 3rd, century, ad, in, a, medical, text, by, the, chinese, physician, hua, tuo, who, stated, to, drink, bitter, t, u, constantly, makes, one, think, better, however, before, the, tang, dynasty, tea, drinking, was, primarily, a, southern, chinese, practice, centered, in, jiankang, tea, was, disdained, by, the, northern, dynasties, aristocrats, who, describe, it, as, inferior, to, yogurt, it, became, widely, popular, during, the, tang, dynasty, when, it, spread, to, korea, japan, and, vietnam, the, classic, of, tea, a, treatise, on, tea, and, its, preparations, was, written, by, the, 8th, century, chinese, writer, lu, yu, he, was, known, to, have, influenced, tea, drinking, on, a, large, part, in, china, through, the, centuries, a, variety, of, techniques, for, processing, tea, and, a, number, of, different, forms, of, tea, were, developed, during, the, tang, dynasty, tea, was, steamed, then, pounded, and, shaped, into, cake, form, while, in, the, song, dynasty, loose, leaf, tea, was, developed, and, became, popular, during, the, yuan, and, ming, dynasties, unoxidized, tea, leaves, were, first, stirred, in, a, hot, dry, pan, then, rolled, and, air, dried, a, process, that, stops, the, oxidation, process, that, would, have, turned, the, leaves, dark, thereby, allowing, tea, to, remain, green, in, the, 15th, century, oolong, tea, in, which, the, leaves, are, allowed, to, partially, oxidize, before, being, heated, in, the, pan, was, developed, western, tastes, however, favoured, the, fully, oxidized, black, tea, and, the, leaves, were, allowed, to, oxidize, further, yellow, tea, was, an, accidental, discovery, in, the, production, of, green, tea, during, the, ming, dynasty, when, apparently, careless, practices, allowed, the, leaves, to, turn, yellow, which, yielded, a, different, flavour, tea, was, first, introduced, to, western, priests, and, merchants, in, china, during, the, 16th, century, at, which, time, it, was, termed, ch, the, earliest, european, reference, to, tea, written, as, chiai, came, from, delle, navigationi, e, viaggi, written, by, venetian, giambattista, ramusio, in, 1545, the, first, recorded, shipment, of, tea, by, a, european, nation, was, in, 1607, when, the, dutch, east, india, company, moved, a, cargo, of, tea, from, macao, to, java, then, two, years, later, the, dutch, bought, the, first, assignment, of, tea, which, was, from, hirado, in, japan, to, be, shipped, to, europe, tea, became, a, fashionable, drink, in, the, hague, in, the, netherlands, and, the, dutch, introduced, the, drink, to, germany, france, and, across, the, atlantic, to, new, amsterdam, new, york, in, 1567, russian, people, came, in, contact, with, tea, when, the, cossack, atamans, petrov, and, yalyshev, visited, china, the, mongolian, khan, donated, to, tsar, michael, i, four, poods, 65, 70, kg, of, tea, in, 1638, according, to, jeremiah, curtin, it, was, possibly, in, 1636, that, vassili, starkov, was, sent, as, envoy, to, the, altyn, khan, he, was, given, 250, pounds, of, tea, as, a, gift, to, the, tsar, starkov, at, first, refused, seeing, no, use, for, a, load, of, dead, leaves, but, the, khan, insisted, thus, was, tea, introduced, to, russia, in, 1679, russia, concluded, a, treaty, on, regular, tea, supplies, from, china, via, camel, caravan, in, exchange, for, furs, it, is, today, considered, the, de, facto, national, beverage, the, first, record, of, tea, in, english, came, from, a, letter, written, by, richard, wickham, who, ran, an, east, india, company, office, in, japan, writing, to, a, merchant, in, macao, requesting, the, best, sort, of, chaw, in, 1615, peter, mundy, a, traveller, and, merchant, who, came, across, tea, in, fujian, in, 1637, wrote, chaa, only, water, with, a, kind, of, herb, boyled, in, it, tea, was, sold, in, a, coffee, house, in, london, in, 1657, samuel, pepys, tasted, tea, in, 1660, and, catherine, of, braganza, took, the, tea, drinking, habit, to, the, english, court, when, she, married, charles, ii, in, 1662, tea, however, was, not, widely, consumed, in, the, british, isles, until, the, 18th, century, and, remained, expensive, until, the, latter, part, of, that, period, english, drinkers, preferred, to, add, sugar, and, milk, to, black, tea, and, black, tea, overtook, green, tea, in, popularity, in, the, 1720s, tea, smuggling, during, the, 18th, century, led, to, the, general, public, being, able, to, afford, and, consume, tea, the, british, government, removed, the, tax, on, tea, thereby, eliminating, the, smuggling, trade, by, 1785, in, britain, and, ireland, tea, was, initially, consumed, as, a, luxury, item, on, special, occasions, such, as, religious, festivals, wakes, and, domestic, work, gatherings, the, price, of, tea, in, europe, fell, steadily, during, the, 19th, century, especially, after, indian, tea, began, to, arrive, in, large, quantities, by, the, late, 19th, century, tea, had, become, an, everyday, beverage, for, all, levels, of, society, the, popularity, of, tea, played, a, role, in, historical, events, the, tea, act, of, 1773, provoked, the, boston, tea, party, that, escalated, into, the, american, revolution, the, need, to, address, the, issue, of, british, trade, deficit, because, of, the, trade, in, tea, resulted, in, the, opium, wars, the, qing, kangxi, emperor, had, banned, foreign, products, from, being, sold, in, china, decreeing, in, 1685, that, all, goods, bought, from, china, must, be, paid, for, in, silver, coin, or, bullion, traders, from, other, nations, then, sought, to, find, another, product, in, this, case, opium, to, sell, to, china, to, earn, back, the, silver, they, were, required, to, pay, for, tea, and, other, commodities, the, subsequent, attempts, by, the, chinese, government, to, curtail, the, trade, in, opium, led, to, war, chinese, small, leaf, type, tea, was, introduced, into, india, in, 1836, by, the, british, in, an, attempt, to, break, the, chinese, monopoly, on, tea, in, 1841, archibald, campbell, brought, seeds, of, chinese, tea, from, the, kumaun, region, and, experimented, with, planting, tea, in, darjeeling, the, alubari, tea, garden, was, opened, in, 1856, and, darjeeling, tea, began, to, be, produced, in, 1848, robert, fortune, was, sent, by, the, east, india, company, on, a, mission, to, china, to, bring, the, tea, plant, back, to, great, britain, he, began, his, journey, in, high, secrecy, as, his, mission, occurred, in, the, lull, between, the, first, opium, war, and, the, second, opium, war, the, chinese, tea, plants, he, brought, back, were, introduced, to, the, himalayas, though, most, did, not, survive, the, british, had, discovered, that, a, different, variety, of, tea, was, endemic, to, assam, and, the, northeast, region, of, india, which, was, then, hybridized, with, chinese, small, leaf, type, tea, using, chinese, planting, and, cultivation, techniques, the, british, colonial, government, established, a, tea, industry, by, offering, land, in, assam, to, any, european, who, agreed, to, cultivate, it, for, export, tea, was, originally, consumed, only, by, anglo, indians, however, it, became, widely, popular, in, india, in, the, 1950s, because, of, a, successful, advertising, campaign, by, the, india, tea, board, the, british, introduced, tea, industry, to, sri, lanka, then, ceylon, in, 1867, physically, speaking, tea, has, properties, of, both, a, solution, and, a, suspension, it, is, a, solution, of, the, water, soluble, compounds, extracted, from, the, tea, leaves, such, as, the, polyphenols, and, amino, acids, tea, infusions, are, among, most, consumed, beverages, globally, caffeine, makes, up, about, 3, of, tea, s, dry, weight, which, translates, to, between, 30, and, 90, milligrams, per, 250, millilitre, 8, 1, 2, us, fl, oz, cup, depending, on, the, type, brand, and, brewing, method, a, study, found, that, the, caffeine, content, of, one, gram, of, black, tea, ranged, from, 22, to, 28, mg, while, the, caffeine, content, of, one, gram, of, green, tea, ranged, from, 11, to, 20, mg, reflecting, a, significant, difference, tea, contains, small, amounts, of, theobromine, and, theophylline, which, are, xanthines, and, stimulants, similar, to, caffeine, the, astringency, in, tea, can, be, attributed, to, the, presence, of, polyphenols, these, are, the, most, abundant, compounds, in, tea, leaves, making, up, 30, 40, of, their, composition, polyphenols, in, tea, include, flavonoids, epigallocatechin, gallate, egcg, and, other, catechins, although, there, has, been, preliminary, clinical, research, on, whether, green, or, black, teas, may, protect, against, various, human, diseases, there, is, no, evidence, that, tea, polyphenols, have, any, effect, on, health, or, lowering, disease, risk, although, health, benefits, have, been, assumed, throughout, the, history, of, camellia, sinensis, s, consumption, there, is, no, high, quality, evidence, showing, that, tea, consumption, gives, significant, benefits, other, than, possibly, increasing, alertness, an, effect, caused, by, caffeine, in, the, tea, leaves, in, clinical, research, conducted, in, the, early, 21st, century, it, was, found, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, to, indicate, that, consuming, tea, affects, any, disease, or, improves, health, black, and, green, teas, contain, no, essential, nutrients, in, significant, amounts, with, the, exception, of, the, dietary, mineral, manganese, at, 0, 5, mg, per, cup, or, 26, of, the, reference, daily, intake, rdi, fluoride, is, sometimes, present, in, tea, certain, types, of, brick, tea, made, from, old, leaves, and, stems, have, the, highest, levels, enough, to, pose, a, health, risk, if, much, tea, is, drunk, which, has, been, attributed, to, high, levels, of, fluoride, in, soils, acidic, soils, and, long, brewing, camellia, sinensis, is, an, evergreen, plant, that, grows, mainly, in, tropical, and, subtropical, climates, some, varieties, can, tolerate, oceanic, climates, and, are, cultivated, as, far, north, as, cornwall, in, england, perthshire, in, scotland, washington, in, the, united, states, and, vancouver, island, in, canada, in, the, southern, hemisphere, tea, is, grown, as, far, south, as, hobart, in, tasmania, and, waikato, in, new, zealand, tea, plants, are, propagated, from, seed, and, cuttings, about, 4, to, 12, years, are, needed, for, a, plant, to, bear, seed, and, about, three, years, before, a, new, plant, is, ready, for, harvesting, in, addition, to, a, zone, 8, climate, or, warmer, tea, plants, require, at, least, 127, cm, 50, in, of, rainfall, per, year, and, prefer, acidic, soils, many, high, quality, tea, plants, are, cultivated, at, elevations, of, up, to, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, above, sea, level, though, at, these, heights, the, plants, grow, more, slowly, they, acquire, a, better, flavour, two, principal, varieties, are, used, camellia, sinensis, var, sinensis, which, is, used, for, most, chinese, formosan, and, japanese, teas, and, c, sinensis, var, assamica, used, in, pu, erh, and, most, indian, teas, but, not, darjeeling, within, these, botanical, varieties, many, strains, and, modern, clonal, varieties, are, known, leaf, size, is, the, chief, criterion, for, the, classification, of, tea, plants, with, three, primary, classifications, being, assam, type, characterised, by, the, largest, leaves, china, type, characterised, by, the, smallest, leaves, and, cambodian, type, characterised, by, leaves, of, intermediate, size, the, cambodian, type, tea, c, assamica, subsp, lasiocaly, was, originally, considered, a, type, of, assam, tea, however, later, genetic, work, showed, that, it, is, a, hybrid, between, chinese, small, leaf, tea, and, assam, type, tea, darjeeling, tea, appears, to, be, a, hybrid, between, chinese, small, leaf, tea, and, assam, type, large, leaf, tea, a, tea, plant, will, grow, into, a, tree, of, up, to, 16, m, 52, ft, if, left, undisturbed, but, cultivated, plants, are, generally, pruned, to, waist, height, for, ease, of, plucking, the, short, plants, bear, more, new, shoots, which, provide, new, and, tender, leaves, and, increase, the, quality, of, the, tea, only, the, top, 2, 5, 5, centimetres, 1, 2, in, of, the, mature, plant, are, picked, these, buds, and, leaves, are, called, flushes, a, plant, will, grow, a, new, flush, every, 7, to, 15, days, during, the, growing, season, leaves, that, are, slow, in, development, tend, to, produce, better, flavoured, teas, several, teas, are, available, from, specified, flushes, for, example, darjeeling, tea, is, available, as, first, flush, at, a, premium, price, second, flush, monsoon, and, autumn, assam, second, flush, or, tippy, tea, is, considered, superior, to, first, flush, because, of, the, gold, tips, that, appear, on, the, leaves, pests, that, can, afflict, tea, plants, include, mosquito, bugs, genus, helopeltis, which, are, true, bugs, and, not, to, be, confused, with, dipterous, insects, of, family, culicidae, mosquitos, mosquito, bugs, can, damage, leaves, both, by, sucking, plant, materials, and, by, the, laying, of, eggs, oviposition, within, the, plant, spraying, with, synthetic, insecticides, may, be, deemed, appropriate, other, pests, are, lepidopteran, leaf, feeders, and, various, tea, diseases, tea, is, mainly, grown, in, asia, and, africa, with, smaller, areas, in, south, america, and, around, the, black, and, caspian, seas, the, four, biggest, tea, producing, countries, are, china, india, kenya, and, sri, lanka, together, representing, 81, of, world, tea, production, smaller, hubs, of, production, include, such, places, as, s, o, miguel, island, azores, in, portugal, and, guria, in, georgia, in, 2022, global, production, of, tea, was, 29, 8, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 49, and, india, with, 20, of, the, world, total, kenya, sri, lanka, and, turkey, were, secondary, producers, storage, conditions, determine, the, shelf, life, of, tea, that, of, black, teas, is, greater, than, that, of, green, teas, some, such, as, flower, teas, may, last, only, a, month, or, so, others, such, as, pu, erh, improve, with, age, to, remain, fresh, and, prevent, mold, tea, needs, to, be, stored, away, from, heat, light, air, and, moisture, tea, must, be, kept, at, room, temperature, in, an, air, tight, container, black, tea, in, a, bag, within, a, sealed, opaque, canister, may, keep, for, two, years, green, tea, deteriorates, more, rapidly, usually, in, less, than, a, year, tightly, rolled, gunpowder, tea, leaves, keep, longer, than, the, more, open, leafed, chun, mee, tea, storage, life, for, all, teas, can, be, extended, by, using, desiccant, or, oxygen, absorbing, packets, vacuum, sealing, or, refrigeration, in, air, tight, containers, except, green, tea, where, discrete, use, of, refrigeration, or, freezing, is, recommended, and, temperature, variation, kept, to, a, minimum, tea, is, divided, into, categories, based, on, how, it, is, processed, at, least, six, different, types, are, produced, after, picking, the, leaves, of, c, sinensis, soon, begin, to, wilt, and, oxidize, unless, immediately, dried, an, enzymatic, oxidation, process, triggered, by, the, plant, s, intracellular, enzymes, causes, the, leaves, to, turn, progressively, darker, as, their, chlorophyll, breaks, down, and, tannins, are, released, this, darkening, is, stopped, at, a, predetermined, stage, by, heating, which, deactivates, the, enzymes, responsible, in, the, production, of, black, teas, halting, by, heating, is, carried, out, simultaneously, with, drying, without, careful, moisture, and, temperature, control, during, manufacture, and, packaging, growth, of, undesired, molds, and, bacteria, may, make, tea, unfit, for, consumption, after, basic, processing, teas, may, be, altered, through, additional, processing, steps, before, being, sold, and, is, often, consumed, with, additions, to, the, basic, tea, leaf, and, water, added, during, preparation, or, drinking, examples, of, additional, processing, steps, that, occur, before, tea, is, sold, are, blending, flavouring, scenting, and, decaffeination, of, teas, examples, of, additions, added, at, the, point, of, consumption, include, milk, sugar, and, lemon, tea, blending, is, the, combination, of, different, teas, together, to, achieve, the, final, product, such, teas, may, combine, others, from, the, same, cultivation, area, or, several, different, ones, the, aim, is, to, obtain, consistency, better, taste, higher, price, or, some, combination, of, the, three, flavoured, and, scented, teas, are, enhancements, of, the, base, tea, this, can, be, accomplished, through, directly, adding, flavouring, agents, such, as, ginger, cloves, mint, leaves, cardamom, bergamot, found, in, earl, grey, vanilla, and, spearmint, alternatively, because, tea, easily, retains, odours, it, can, be,

the, order, of, steps, in, preparing, a, cup, of, tea, is, a, much, debated, topic, and, can, vary, widely, between, cultures, and, individuals, some, say, it, is, preferable, to, add, the, milk, to, the, cup, before, the, tea, as, the, high, temperature, of, freshly, brewed, tea, can, denature, the, proteins, found, in, fresh, milk, similar, to, the, change, in, taste, of, uht, milk, resulting, in, an, inferior, tasting, beverage, others, insist, it, is, better, to, add, the, milk, to, the, cup, after, the, tea, as, black, tea, is, often, brewed, as, close, to, boiling, as, possible, the, addition, of, milk, chills, the, beverage, during, the, crucial, brewing, phase, if, brewing, in, a, cup, rather, than, using, a, pot, meaning, the, delicate, flavour, of, a, good, tea, cannot, be, fully, appreciated, by, adding, the, milk, afterwards, it, is, easier, to, dissolve, sugar, in, the, tea, and, to, ensure, the, desired, amount, of, milk, is, added, as, the, colour, of, the, tea,

slower, the, drink, cools, a, 2007, study, published, in, the, european, heart, journal, found, certain, beneficial, effects, of, tea, may, be, lost, through, the, addition, of, milk, in, 1907,
