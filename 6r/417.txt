jujutsu, d, u, d, u, t, s, u, joo, joo, tsu, japanese, j, jutsu, pronounced, also, known, as, jiu, jitsu, and, ju, jitsu, is, a, family, of, japanese, martial, arts, and, a, system, of, close, combat, unarmed, or, with, a, minor, weapon, that, can, be, used, in, a, defensive, or, offensive, manner, to, kill, or, subdue, one, or, more, weaponless, or, armed, and, armored, opponents, it, was, coined, by, hisamori, tenenuchi, when, he, officially, established, the, first, school, of, jiu, jitsu, in, japan, a, subset, of, techniques, from, certain, styles, of, jujutsu, were, used, to, develop, many, modern, martial, arts, and, combat, sports, such, as, judo, aikido, sambo, arb, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, via, judo, and, mixed, martial, arts, j, can, be, translated, as, gentle, soft, supple, flexible, pliable, or, yielding, and, jutsu, can, be, translated, as, art, or, technique, jujutsu, thus, has, the, meaning, of, yielding, art, as, its, core, philosophy, is, to, manipulate, the, opponent, s, force, against, themself, rather, than, confronting, it, with, one, s, own, force, jujutsu, developed, to, combat, the, samurai, of, feudal, japan, as, a, method, for, defeating, an, armed, and, armored, opponent, in, which, one, uses, no, form, of, weapon, or, only, a, short, weapon, because, striking, against, an, armored, opponent, proved, ineffective, practitioners, learned, that, the, most, efficient, methods, for, neutralizing, an, enemy, took, the, form, of, pins, joint, locks, and, throws, these, techniques, were, developed, around, the, principle, of, using, an, attacker, s, energy, against, them, rather, than, directly, opposing, it, there, are, many, variations, of, the, art, which, leads, to, a, diversity, of, approaches, jujutsu, schools, ry, may, utilize, all, forms, of, grappling, techniques, to, some, degree, e, g, throwing, takedowns, leg, sweeps, trapping, pins, joint, locks, holds, chokeholds, strangulation, gouging, biting, hair, pulling, disengagements, and, striking, in, addition, to, jujutsu, many, schools, teach, the, use, of, weapons, today, jujutsu, is, practiced, in, both, traditional, self, defense, oriented, and, modern, sports, forms, derived, sport, forms, include, the, olympic, sport, and, martial, art, of, judo, which, was, developed, by, kan, jigor, in, the, late, 19th, century, from, several, traditional, styles, of, jujutsu, and, sambo, and, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, which, were, derived, from, earlier, pre, world, war, ii, versions, of, kodokan, judo, that, had, more, emphasis, on, ground, fighting, which, also, caused, the, creation, of, kosen, judo, jujutsu, the, standard, english, language, spelling, is, derived, using, the, hepburn, romanization, system, before, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, however, jiu, jitsu, and, ju, jitsu, were, preferred, even, though, the, romanization, of, the, second, kanji, as, jitsu, is, not, faithful, to, the, standard, japanese, pronunciation, it, was, a, non, standardized, spelling, resulting, from, how, english, speakers, heard, the, second, short, u, in, the, word, which, is, pronounced, and, therefore, close, to, a, short, english, i, this, may, also, be, a, reflection, of, the, speech, of, shitamachi, that, merges, ju, into, ji, since, japanese, martial, arts, first, became, widely, known, of, in, the, west, in, that, time, period, these, earlier, spellings, are, still, common, in, many, places, ju, jitsu, is, still, a, common, spelling, in, france, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, while, jiu, jitsu, is, most, widely, used, in, germany, and, brazil, different, from, the, japanese, pronunciation, the, word, jujutsu, is, still, usually, pronounced, as, if, it, is, spelled, jujitsu, in, the, united, states, some, define, jujutsu, and, similar, arts, rather, narrowly, as, unarmed, close, combat, systems, used, to, defeat, or, control, an, enemy, who, is, similarly, unarmed, basic, methods, of, attack, include, hitting, or, striking, thrusting, or, punching, kicking, throwing, pinning, or, immobilizing, strangling, and, joint, locking, great, pains, were, also, taken, by, the, bushi, classic, warriors, to, develop, effective, methods, of, defense, including, parrying, or, blocking, strikes, thrusts, and, kicks, receiving, throws, or, joint, locking, techniques, i, e, falling, safely, and, knowing, how, to, blend, to, neutralize, a, technique, s, effect, releasing, oneself, from, an, enemy, s, grasp, and, changing, or, shifting, one, s, position, to, evade, or, neutralize, an, attack, as, jujutsu, is, a, collective, term, some, schools, or, ryu, adopted, the, principle, of, ju, more, than, others, from, a, broader, point, of, view, based, on, the, curricula, of, many, of, the, classical, japanese, arts, themselves, however, these, arts, may, perhaps, be, more, accurately, defined, as, unarmed, methods, of, dealing, with, an, enemy, who, was, armed, together, with, methods, of, using, minor, weapons, such, as, the, jutte, truncheon, also, called, jitter, tant, knife, or, kakushi, buki, hidden, weapons, such, as, the, ryofundo, kusari, weighted, chain, or, the, bankokuchoki, a, type, of, knuckle, duster, to, defeat, both, armed, or, unarmed, opponents, furthermore, the, term, jujutsu, was, also, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, tactics, for, infighting, used, with, the, warrior, s, major, weapons, katana, or, tachi, sword, yari, spear, naginata, glaive, j, short, staff, and, b, quarterstaff, these, close, combat, methods, were, an, important, part, of, the, different, martial, systems, that, were, developed, for, use, on, the, battlefield, they, can, be, generally, characterized, as, either, sengoku, period, 1467, 1603, katchu, bu, jutsu, or, yoroi, kumiuchi, fighting, with, weapons, or, grappling, while, clad, in, armor, or, edo, period, 1603, 1867, suhada, bu, jutsu, fighting, while, dressed, in, the, normal, street, clothing, of, the, period, kimono, and, hakama,

first, began, during, the, nara, period, c, 710, c, 794, combining, early, forms, of, sumo, and, various, japanese, martial, arts, which, were, used, on, the, battlefield, for, close, combat, the, oldest, known, styles, of, jujutsu, are, shinden, fudo, ry, c, 1130, tenshin, sh, den, katori, shint, ry, c, 1447, and, takenouchi, ry, which, was, founded, in, the, sengoku, period, c, 1530s, many, jujutsu, forms, also, extensively, taught, parrying, and, counterattacking, long, weapons, such, as, swords, or, spears, via, a, dagger, or, other, small, weapons, in, contrast, to, the, neighbouring, nations, of, china, and, okinawa, whose, martial, arts, made, greater, use, of, striking, techniques, japanese, hand, to, hand, combat, forms, focused, heavily, upon, throwing, including, joint, locking, throws, immobilizing, joint, locks, choking, strangulation, and, to, lesser, extent, ground, fighting, in, the, early, 17th, century, during, the, edo, period, jujutsu, continued, to, evolve, due, to, the, strict, laws, which, were, imposed, by, the, tokugawa, shogunate, to, reduce, war, as, influenced, by, the, chinese, social, philosophy, of, neo, confucianism, which, was, obtained, during, hideyoshi, s, invasions, of, korea, and, spread, throughout, japan, via, scholars, such, as, fujiwara, seika, during, this, new, ideology, weapons, and, armor, became, unused, decorative, items, so, hand, to, hand, combat, flourished, as, a, form, of, self, defense, and, new, techniques, were, created, to, adapt, to, the, changing, situation, of, unarmored, opponents, this, included, the, development, of, various, striking, techniques, in, jujutsu, which, expanded, upon, the, limited, striking, previously, found, in, jujutsu, which, targeted, vital, areas, above, the, shoulders, such, as, the, eyes, throat, and, back, of, the, neck, however, towards, the, 18th, century, the, number, of, striking, techniques, was, severely, reduced, as, they, were, considered, less, effective, and, exert, too, much, energy, instead, striking, in, jujutsu, primarily, became, used, as, a, way, to, distract, the, opponent, or, to, unbalance, him, in, the, lead, up, to, a, joint, lock, strangle, or, throw, during, the, same, period, the, numerous, jujutsu, schools, challenged, each, other, to, duels, which, became, a, popular, pastime, for, warriors, under, a, peaceful, unified, government, from, these, challenges, randori, was, created, to, practice, without, risk, of, breaking, the, law, and, the, various, styles, of, each, school, evolved, from, combating, each, other, without, intention, to, kill, the, term, j, jutsu, was, not, coined, until, the, 17th, century, after, which, time, it, became, a, blanket, term, for, a, wide, variety, of, grappling, related, disciplines, and, techniques, prior, to, that, time, these, skills, had, names, such, as, short, sword, grappling, kogusoku, koshi, no, mawari, grappling, or, kumiuchi, body, art, taijutsu, softness, or, yawara, art, of, harmony, wajutsu, yawarajutsu, catching, hand, torite, and, even, the, way, of, softness, j, d, as, early, as, 1724, almost, two, centuries, before, kan, jigor, founded, the, modern, art, of, kodokan, judo, today, the, systems, of, unarmed, combat, that, were, developed, and, practiced, during, the, muromachi, period, 1333, 1573, are, referred, to, collectively, as, japanese, old, style, jujutsu, nihon, kory, j, jutsu, at, this, period, in, history, the, systems, practiced, were, not, systems, of, unarmed, combat, but, rather, means, for, an, unarmed, or, lightly, armed, warrior, to, fight, a, heavily, armed, and, armored, enemy, on, the, battlefield, in, battle, it, was, often, impossible, for, a, samurai, to, use, his, long, sword, or, polearm, and, would, therefore, be, forced, to, rely, on, his, short, sword, dagger, or, bare, hands, when, fully, armored, the, effective, use, of, such, minor, weapons, necessitated, the, employment, of, grappling, skills, methods, of, combat, as, mentioned, above, included, striking, kicking, and, punching, various, takedowns, trips, throwing, body, throws, shoulder, and, hip, throws, joint, locking, throws, sacrifice, throws, unbalance, and, leg, sweeping, throws, restraining, pinning, strangling, grappling, wrestling, and, rope, tying, and, weaponry, defensive, tactics, included, blocking, evading, off, balancing, blending, and, escaping, minor, weapons, such, as, the, tant, knife, ryofundo, kusari, weighted, chain, kabuto, wari, helmet, breaker, and, kaku, shi, buki, secret, or, disguised, weapons, were, almost, always, included, in, sengoku, jujutsu, in, later, times, other, ko, ry, developed, into, systems, more, familiar, to, the, practitioners, of, nihon, jujutsu, commonly, seen, today, these, are, correctly, classified, as, edo, j, jutsu, founded, during, the, edo, period, they, are, generally, designed, to, deal, with, opponents, neither, wearing, armor, nor, in, a, battlefield, environment, but, instead, utilize, grips, and, holds, on, opponent, s, clothing, most, systems, of, edo, jujutsu, include, extensive, use, of, atemi, waza, vital, striking, technique, which, would, be, of, little, use, against, an, armored, opponent, on, a, battlefield, they, would, however, be, quite, valuable, in, confronting, an, enemy, or, opponent, during, peacetime, dressed, in, normal, street, attire, referred, to, as, suhada, bujutsu, occasionally, inconspicuous, weapons, such, as, tant, daggers, or, tessen, iron, fans, were, included, in, the, curriculum, of, edo, j, jutsu, another, seldom, seen, historical, side, is, a, series, of, techniques, originally, included, in, both, sengoku, and, edo, jujutsu, systems, referred, to, as, hojo, waza, hojojutsu, tori, nawa, jutsu, nawa, jutsu, hayakawa, and, others, it, involves, the, use, of, a, hojo, cord, sometimes, the, sageo, or, tasuke, to, restrain, or, strangle, an, attacker, these, techniques, have, for, the, most, part, faded, from, use, in, modern, times, but, tokyo, police, units, still, train, in, their, use, and, continue, to, carry, a, hojo, cord, in, addition, to, handcuffs, the, very, old, takenouchi, ryu, is, one, of, the, better, recognized, systems, that, continue, extensive, training, in, hojo, waza, since, the, establishment, of, the, meiji, period, with, the, abolishment, of, the, samurai, and, the, wearing, of, swords, the, ancient, tradition, of, yagy, shingan, ry, sendai, and, edo, lines, has, focused, much, towards, the, jujutsu, yawara, contained, in, its, syllabus, many, other, legitimate, nihon, jujutsu, ryu, exist, but, are, not, considered, koryu, ancient, traditions, these, are, called, either, gendai, jujutsu, or, modern, jujutsu, modern, jujutsu, traditions, were, founded, after, or, towards, the, end, of, the, tokugawa, period, 1868, when, more, than, 2000, schools, ry, of, j, jutsu, existed, various, supposedly, traditional, ryu, and, ryuha, that, are, commonly, thought, of, as, koryu, jujutsu, are, actually, gendai, j, jutsu, although, modern, in, formation, very, few, gendai, jujutsu, systems, have, direct, historical, links, to, ancient, traditions, and, are, incorrectly, referred, to, as, traditional, martial, systems, or, koryu, their, curriculum, reflects, an, obvious, bias, towards, techniques, from, judo, and, edo, j, jutsu, systems, and, sometimes, have, little, to, no, emphasis, on, standing, armlocks, and, joint, locking, throws, that, were, common, in, koryu, styles, they, also, usually, do, not, teach, usage, of, traditional, weapons, as, opposed, to, the, sengoku, j, jutsu, systems, that, did, the, improbability, of, confronting, an, armor, clad, attacker, and, using, traditional, weapons, is, the, reason, for, this, bias, over, time, gendai, jujutsu, has, been, embraced, by, law, enforcement, officials, worldwide, and, continues, to, be, the, foundation, for, many, specialized, systems, used, by, police, perhaps, the, most, famous, of, these, specialized, police, systems, is, the, keisatsujutsu, police, art, taiho, jutsu, arresting, art, system, formulated, and, employed, by, the, tokyo, police, department, jujutsu, techniques, have, been, the, basis, for, many, military, unarmed, combat, techniques, including, british, us, russian, special, forces, and, so1, police, units, for, many, years, since, the, early, 1900s, every, military, service, in, the, world, has, an, unarmed, combat, course, that, has, been, founded, on, the, principal, teachings, of, jujutsu, in, the, early, 1900s, edith, garrud, became, the, first, british, female, teacher, of, jujutsu, and, one, of, the, first, female, martial, arts, instructors, in, the, western, world, there, are, many, forms, of, sports, jujutsu, the, original, and, most, popular, being, judo, now, an, olympic, sport, one, of, the, most, common, is, mixed, style, competitions, where, competitors, apply, a, variety, of, strikes, throws, and, holds, to, score, points, there, are, also, kata, competitions, where, competitors, of, the, same, style, perform, techniques, and, are, judged, on, their, performance, there, are, also, freestyle, competitions, where, competitors, take, turns, attacking, each, other, and, the, defender, is, judged, on, performance, another, more, recent, form, of, competition, growing, much, more, popular, in, europe, is, the, random, attack, form, of, competition, which, is, similar, to, randori, but, more, formalized, the, word, jujutsu, can, be, broken, down, into, two, parts, ju, is, a, concept, the, idea, behind, this, meaning, of, ju, is, to, be, gentle, to, give, way, to, yield, to, blend, to, move, out, of, harm, s, way, jutsu, is, the, principle, or, the, action, part, of, ju, jutsu, in, japanese, this, word, means, art, japanese, jujutsu, systems, typically, put, more, emphasis, on, throwing, pinning, and, joint, locking, techniques, as, compared, with, martial, arts, such, as, karate, which, rely, more, on, striking, techniques, striking, techniques, were, seen, as, less, important, in, most, older, japanese, systems, because, of, the, protection, of, samurai, body, armor, and, because, they, were, considered, less, effective, than, throws, and, grappling, so, were, mostly, used, as, set, ups, for, their, grappling, techniques, and, throws, although, some, styles, such, as, y, shin, ry, tenjin, shin, y, ry, and, kyushin, ry, had, more, emphasis, on, striking, however, many, modern, day, jujutsu, schools, include, striking, both, as, a, set, up, for, further, techniques, or, as, a, stand, alone, action, in, jujutsu, practitioners, train, in, the, use, of, many, potentially, fatal, or, crippling, moves, such, as, joint, locking, throws, however, because, students, mostly, train, in, a, non, competitive, environment, the, risk, is, minimized, students, are, taught, break, falling, skills, to, allow, them, to, safely, practice, otherwise, dangerous, throws, as, jujutsu, has, so, many, facets, it, has, become, the, foundation, for, a, variety, of, styles, and, derivations, today, as, each, instructor, incorporated, new, techniques, and, tactics, into, what, was, taught, to, them, originally, they, codified, and, developed, their, own, ryu, school, or, federation, to, help, other, instructors, schools, and, clubs, some, of, these, schools, modified, the, source, material, enough, that, they, no, longer, consider, themselves, a, style, of, jujutsu, arguments, and, discussions, amongst, the, martial, arts, fraternity, have, evoked, to, the, topic, of, whether, specific, methods, are, in, fact, not, jujitsu, at, all, tracing, the, history, of, a, specific, school, can, be, cumbersome, and, impossible, in, some, circumstances, around, the, year, 1600, there, were, over, 2000, jujutsu, ko, ry, styles, most, with, at, least, some, common, descent, characteristics, and, shared, techniques, specific, technical, characteristics, a, list, of, techniques, and, the, way, techniques, were, performed, varied, from, school, to, school, many, of, the, generalizations, noted, above, do, not, hold, true, for, some, schools, of, jujutsu, schools, of, jujutsu, with, long, lineages, include, aikido, is, a, modern, martial, art, developed, primarily, during, the, late, 1920s, through, the, 1930s, by, morihei, ueshiba, from, the, system, of, dait, ry, aiki, j, jutsu, ueshiba, was, an, accomplished, student, of, takeda, sokaku, with, aikido, being, a, systemic, refinement, of, defensive, techniques, from, aiki, jujutsu, in, ways, that, are, intended, to, prevent, harm, to, either, the, attacker, or, the, defender, aikido, changed, much, during, ueshiba, s, lifetime, so, earlier, styles, such, as, yoshinkan, are, more, like, the, original, aiki, jujutsu, than, ones, such, as, ki, aikido, that, more, resemble, the, techniques, and, philosophy, that, ueshiba, stressed, towards, the, end, of, his, life, wad, ry, is, one, of, the, four, major, karate, styles, and, was, founded, by, hironori, otsuka, 1892, 1982, wad, ry, is, a, hybrid, of, japanese, martial, arts, such, as, shind, y, shin, ry, ju, jitsu, shotokan, karate, and, shito, ryu, karate, the, style, itself, emphasizes, not, only, striking, but, also, tai, sabaki, joint, locks, and, throws, it, has, its, origins, within, tomari, te, from, one, point, of, view, wad, ry, might, be, considered, a, style, of, j, jutsu, rather, than, karate, hironori, tsuka, embraced, ju, jitsu, and, was, its, chief, instructor, for, a, time, when, tsuka, first, registered, his, school, with, the, dai, nippon, butoku, kai, in, 1938, the, style, was, called, shinshu, wad, ry, karate, j, jutsu, a, name, that, reflects, its, hybrid, character, tsuka, was, a, licensed, shind, y, shin, ry, practitioner, and, a, student, of, y, shin, ry, when, he, first, met, the, okinawan, karate, master, gichin, funakoshi, after, having, learned, from, funakoshi, and, after, their, split, with, okinawan, masters, such, as, kenwa, mabuni, and, motobu, ch, ki, tsuka, merged, shind, y, shin, ry, with, okinawan, karate, the, result, of, tsuka, s, efforts, is, wad, ry, karate, jujutsu, was, first, introduced, to, europe, in, 1898, by, edward, william, barton, wright, who, had, studied, tenjin, shiny, ry, and, shinden, fudo, ry, in, yokohama, and, kobe, he, also, trained, briefly, at, the, kodokan, in, tokyo, upon, returning, to, england, he, folded, the, basics, of, all, of, these, styles, as, well, as, boxing, savate, and, forms, of, stick, fighting, into, an, eclectic, self, defense, system, called, bartitsu, modern, judo, is, a, classic, example, of, a, sport, that, is, derived, from, jujutsu, many, who, study, judo, believe, as, kan, did, that, judo, is, not, a, sport, but, a, self, defense, system, creating, a, pathway, towards, peace, and, universal, harmony, another, layer, removed, some, popular, arts, had, instructors, who, studied, one, of, these, jujutsu, derivatives, and, later, made, their, own, derivative, succeed, in, the, competition, this, created, an, extensive, family, of, martial, arts, and, sports, that, can, trace, their, lineage, to, jujutsu, in, some, part, the, way, an, opponent, is, dealt, with, also, depends, on, the, teacher, s, philosophy, with, regard, to, combat, this, translates, also, in, different, styles, or, schools, of, jujutsu, not, all, jujutsu, was, used, in, sporting, contests, but, the, practical, use, in, the, samurai, world, ended, circa, 1890, techniques, like, hair, pulling, eye, poking, and, groin, attacks, were, and, are, not, considered, acceptable, in, sport, thus, they, are, excluded, from, judo, competitions, or, randori, however, judo, did, preserve, some, more, lethal, dangerous, techniques, in, its, kata, the, kata, were, intended, to, be, practiced, by, students, of, all, grades, but, now, are, mostly, practiced, formally, as, complete, set, routines, for, performance, kata, competition, and, grading, rather, than, as, individual, self, defense, techniques, in, class, however, judo, retained, the, full, set, of, choking, and, strangling, techniques, for, its, sporting, form, and, all, manner, of, joint, locks, even, judo, s, pinning, techniques, have, pain, generating, spine, and, rib, squeezing, and, smothering, aspects, a, submission, induced, by, a, legal, pin, is, considered, a, legitimate, win, kan, viewed, the, safe, contest, aspect, of, judo, as, an, important, part, of, learning, how, to, control, an, opponent, s, body, in, a, real, fight, kan, always, considered, judo, a, form, of, and, development, of, jujutsu, a, judo, technique, starts, with, gripping, the, opponent, followed, by, off, balancing, them, and, using, their, momentum, against, them, and, then, applying, the, technique, kuzushi, the, art, of, breaking, balance, is, also, used, in, jujutsu, whereby, an, opponent, s, attack, is, deflected, using, their, momentum, against, them, in, order, to, arrest, their, movements, then, throw, them, or, pin, them, with, a, technique, thus, controlling, the, opponent, it, is, known, in, both, systems, that, kuzushi, is, essential, in, order, to, use, as, little, energy, as, possible, jujutsu, differs, from, judo, in, a, number, of, ways, in, some, circumstances, judoka, generates, kuzushi, by, striking, one, s, opponent, along, his, weak, line, other, methods, of, generating, kuzushi, include, grabbing, twisting, poking, or, striking, areas, of, the, body, known, as, atemi, points, or, pressure, points, areas, of, the, body, where, nerves, are, close, to, the, skin, see, kyusho, jitsu, to, unbalance, opponent, and, set, up, throws, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, bjj, was, developed, after, mitsuyo, maeda, brought, judo, to, brazil, in, 1914, maeda, agreed, to, teach, the, art, to, luiz, fran, a, jacintho, ferro, and, carlos, gracie, son, of, his, friend, businessman, and, politician, gast, o, gracie, luiz, fran, a, went, on, to, teach, it, to, oswaldo, fadda, after, carlos, learned, the, art, from, ferro, and, maeda, he, passed, his, knowledge, to, his, brothers, oswaldo, gast, o, jr, and, george, meanwhile, h, lio, gracie, would, peek, in, and, practice, the, techniques, although, he, was, told, he, was, too, young, to, practice, at, the, time, judo, was, still, commonly, called, kan, jiu, jitsu, from, its, founder, kan, jigor, which, is, why, this, style, variation, is, called, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, its, emphasis, shifted, to, ground, fighting, because, the, gracie, family, thought, that, it, was, easier, to, learn, than, throws, and, standup, fighting, and, was, also, more, adequate, to, the,
