cooking, oil, also, known, as, edible, oil, is, a, plant, or, animal, liquid, fat, used, in, frying, baking, and, other, types, of, cooking, oil, allows, higher, cooking, temperatures, than, water, making, cooking, faster, and, more, flavorful, while, likewise, distributing, heat, reducing, burning, and, uneven, cooking, it, sometimes, imparts, its, own, flavor, cooking, oil, is, also, used, in, food, preparation, and, flavoring, not, involving, heat, such, as, salad, dressings, and, bread, dips, cooking, oil, is, typically, a, liquid, at, room, temperature, although, some, oils, that, contain, saturated, fat, such, as, coconut, oil, palm, oil, and, palm, kernel, oil, are, solid, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, cooking, oils, from, plant, sources, such, as, olive, oil, palm, oil, soybean, oil, canola, oil, rapeseed, oil, corn, oil, peanut, oil, and, other, vegetable, oils, as, well, as, animal, based, oils, like, butter, and, lard, oil, can, be, flavored, with, aromatic, foodstuffs, such, as, herbs, chilies, or, garlic, cooking, spray, is, an, aerosol, of, cooking, oil, while, consumption, of, small, amounts, of, saturated, fats, is, common, in, diets, meta, analyses, found, a, significant, correlation, between, high, consumption, of, saturated, fats, and, blood, ldl, concentration, a, risk, factor, for, cardiovascular, diseases, other, meta, analyses, based, on, cohort, studies, and, on, controlled, randomized, trials, found, a, positive, or, neutral, effect, from, consuming, polyunsaturated, fats, instead, of, saturated, fats, a, 10, lower, risk, for, 5, replacement, mayo, clinic, has, highlighted, certain, oils, that, are, high, in, saturated, fats, including, coconut, palm, oil, and, palm, kernel, oil, those, having, lower, amounts, of, saturated, fats, and, higher, levels, of, unsaturated, preferably, omega, 3, fats, like, olive, oil, peanut, oil, canola, oil, soy, and, cottonseed, oils, are, generally, healthier, the, us, national, heart, lung, and, blood, institute, urged, saturated, fats, be, replaced, with, polyunsaturated, and, monounsaturated, fats, listing, olive, and, canola, oils, as, sources, of, healthier, monounsaturated, oils, while, soybean, and, sunflower, oils, as, good, sources, of, polyunsaturated, fats, one, study, showed, that, consumption, of, non, hydrogenated, unsaturated, oils, like, soybean, and, sunflower, is, preferable, to, the, consumption, of, palm, oil, for, lowering, the, risk, of, heart, disease, cashew, oil, and, other, nut, based, oils, do, not, present, a, danger, to, persons, with, a, nut, allergy, because, oils, are, primarily, lipids, and, allergic, reactions, are, due, to, surface, proteins, on, the, nut, the, seeds, of, most, cultivated, plants, contain, higher, levels, of, omega, 6, fatty, acids, than, omega, 3, with, some, notable, exceptions, growth, at, colder, temperatures, tends, to, result, in, higher, levels, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, in, seed, oils, unlike, other, dietary, fats, trans, fats, are, not, essential, and, they, do, not, promote, good, health, the, consumption, of, trans, fats, increases, one, s, risk, of, coronary, heart, disease, by, raising, levels, of, ldl, cholesterol, and, lowering, levels, of, hdl, cholesterol, trans, fats, from, partially, hydrogenated, oils, are, more, harmful, than, naturally, occurring, oils, several, large, studies, indicate, a, link, between, the, consumption, of, high, amounts, of, trans, fat, and, coronary, heart, disease, and, possibly, some, other, diseases, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, fda, the, national, heart, lung, and, blood, institute, and, the, american, heart, association, aha, all, have, recommended, limiting, the, intake, of, trans, fats, in, the, us, trans, fats, are, no, longer, generally, recognized, as, safe, and, cannot, be, added, to, foods, including, cooking, oils, without, special, permission, heating, as, well, as, heating, vessels, rapidly, change, characteristics, of, cooking, oil, oils, that, are, healthy, at, room, temperature, can, become, unhealthy, when, heated, above, certain, temperatures, especially, when, heating, repeatedly, the, toxic, risk, is, linked, to, oxidation, of, fatty, acids, and, fatty, acids, with, higher, levels, of, unsaturation, are, oxidized, more, rapidly, during, heating, in, air, so, when, choosing, a, cooking, oil, it, is, important, to, match, the, oil, s, heat, tolerance, with, the, temperature, which, will, be, used, and, to, change, frying, oil, a, few, times, per, week, deep, fat, frying, temperatures, are, commonly, in, the, range, of, 170, 190, c, 338, 374, f, less, commonly, lower, temperatures, 130, c, 266, f, are, used, palm, oil, contains, more, saturated, fats, than, canola, oil, corn, oil, linseed, oil, soybean, oil, safflower, oil, and, sunflower, oil, therefore, palm, oil, can, withstand, deep, frying, at, higher, temperatures, and, is, resistant, to, oxidation, compared, to, high, polyunsaturated, vegetable, oils, since, the, 1900s, palm, oil, has, been, increasingly, added, into, food, by, the, global, commercial, food, industry, because, it, remains, stable, in, deep, frying, or, in, baking, at, very, high, temperatures, and, for, its, high, levels, of, natural, antioxidants, though, the, refined, palm, oil, used, in, industrial, food, has, lost, most, of, its, carotenoid, content, and, its, orange, red, color, the, following, oils, are, suitable, for, high, temperature, frying, due, to, their, high, smoke, point, less, aggressive, frying, temperatures, are, frequently, used, a, quality, frying, oil, has, a, bland, flavor, at, least, 200, c, 392, f, smoke, and, 315, c, 599, f, flash, points, with, maximums, of, 0, 1, free, fatty, acids, and, 3, linolenic, acid, those, oils, with, higher, linolenic, fractions, are, avoided, due, to, polymerization, or, gumming, marked, by, increases, in, viscosity, with, age, olive, oil, resists, thermal, degradation, and, has, been, used, as, a, frying, oil, for, thousands, of, years, all, oils, degrade, in, response, to, heat, light, and, oxygen, to, delay, the, onset, of, rancidity, a, blanket, of, an, inert, gas, usually, nitrogen, is, applied, to, the, vapor, space, in, the, storage, container, immediately, after, production, a, process, called, tank, blanketing, in, a, cool, dry, place, oils, have, greater, stability, but, may, thicken, although, they, will, soon, return, to, liquid, form, if, they, are, left, at, room, temperature, to, minimize, the, degrading, effects, of, heat, and, light, oils, should, be, removed, from, cold, storage, just, long, enough, for, use, refined, oils, high, in, monounsaturated, fats, such, as, macadamia, oil, keep, up, to, a, year, while, those, high, in, polyunsaturated, fats, such, as, soybean, oil, keep, about, six, months, rancidity, tests, have, shown, that, the, shelf, life, of, walnut, oil, is, about, 3, months, a, period, considerably, shorter, than, the, best, before, date, shown, on, labels, by, contrast, oils, high, in, saturated, fats, such, as, avocado, oil, have, relatively, long, shelf, lives, and, can, be, safely, stored, at, room, temperature, as, the, low, polyunsaturated, fat, content, facilitates, stability, cooking, oils, are, composed, of, various, fractions, of, fatty, acids, for, the, purpose, of, frying, food, oils, high, in, monounsaturated, or, saturated, fats, are, generally, popular, while, oils, high, in, polyunsaturated, fats, are, less, desirable, high, oleic, acid, oils, include, almond, macadamia, olive, pecan, pistachio, and, high, oleic, cultivars, of, safflower, and, sunflower, the, smoke, point, is, marked, by, a, continuous, wisp, of, smoke, it, is, the, temperature, at, which, an, oil, starts, to, burn, leading, to, a, burnt, flavor, in, the, foods, being, prepared, and, degradation, of, nutrients, and, phytochemicals, characteristic, of, the, oil, above, the, smoke, point, are, flash, and, fire, points, the, flash, point, is, the, temperature, at, which, oil, vapors, will, ignite, but, are, not, produced, in, sufficient, quantities, to, stay, lit, the, flash, point, generally, occurs, at, about, 275, 330, c, 527, 626, f, the, fire, point, is, the, temperature, at, which, hot, oil, produces, sufficient, vapors, they, will, catch, on, fire, and, burn, as, frying, hours, increase, all, these, temperature, points, decrease, they, depend, more, on, an, oil, s, acidity, than, fatty, acid, profile, the, smoke, point, of, cooking, oils, varies, generally, in, association, with, how, oil, is, refined, a, higher, smoke, point, results, from, removal, of, impurities, and, free, fatty, acids, residual, solvent, remaining, from, the, refining, process, may, decrease, the, smoke, point, it, has, been, reported, to, increase, with, the, inclusion, of, antioxidants, bha, bht, and, tbhq, for, these, reasons, the, published, smoke, points, of, oils, may, vary, oils, are, extracted, from, nuts, seeds, olives, grains, or, legumes, by, extraction, using, industrial, chemicals, or, by, mechanical, processes, expeller, pressing, is, a, chemical, free, process, that, collects, oils, from, a, source, using, a, mechanical, press, with, minimal, heat, cold, pressed, oils, are, extracted, under, a, controlled, temperature, setting, usually, below, 105, c, 221, f, intended, to, preserve, naturally, occurring, phytochemicals, such, as, polyphenols, tocotrienols, plant, sterols, and, vitamin, e, which, collectively, affect, color, flavor, aroma, and, nutrient, value, cooking, oil, extraction, and, refinement, are, separate, processes, extraction, first, removes, the, oil, typically, from, a, seed, nut, or, fruit, refinement, then, alters, the, appearance, texture, taste, smell, or, stability, of, the, oil, to, meet, buyer, expectations, there, are, three, broad, types, of, oil, extraction, in, large, scale, industrial, oil, extraction, you, will, often, see, some, combination, of, pressing, chemical, extraction, and, or, centrifuging, in, order, to, extract, the, maximum, amount, of, oil, possible, cooking, oil, can, either, be, unrefined, or, refined, using, one, or, more, of, the, following, refinement, processes, in, any, combination, filtering, a, non, chemical, process, which, screens, out, larger, particles, could, be, considered, a, step, in, refinement, although, it, does, not, alter, the, state, of, the, oil, most, large, scale, commercial, cooking, oil, refinement, will, involve, all, of, these, steps, in, order, to, achieve, a, product, that, s, uniform, in, taste, smell, and, appearance, and, has, a, longer, shelf, life, cooking, oil, intended, for, the, health, food, market, will, often, be, unrefined, which, can, result, in, a, less, stable, product, but, minimizes, exposure, to, high, temperatures, and, chemical, processing, proper, disposal, of, used, cooking, oil, is, an, important, waste, management, concern, oil, can, congeal, in, pipes, causing, sanitary, sewer, overflow, because, of, this, cooking, oil, should, never, be, dumped, in, the, kitchen, sink, or, in, the, toilet, bowl, the, proper, way, to, dispose, of, oil, is, to, put, it, in, a, sealed, non, recyclable, container, and, discard, it, with, regular, garbage, placing, the, container, of, oil, in, the, refrigerator, to, harden, also, makes, disposal, easier, and, less, messy, cooking, oil, can, be, recycled, it, can, be, used, in, animal, feed, soap, make, up, clothes, rubber, detergents, directly, as, fuel, and, to, produce, biodiesel, in, the, recycling, industry, used, cooking, oil, recovered, from, restaurants, and, food, processing, industries, typically, from, deep, fryers, or, griddles, is, called, yellow, grease, recycled, vegetable, oil, rvo, used, vegetable, oil, uvo, or, waste, vegetable, oil, wvo, grease, traps, or, interceptors, collect, fats, and, oils, from, kitchen, sinks, and, floor, drains, the, result, is, called, brown, grease, and, unlike, yellow, grease, its, severe, contaminants, make, it, much, harder, to, recycle, gutter, oil, and, trench, oil, are, terms, used, in, china, to, describe, recycled, oil, processed, to, resemble, virgin, oil, but, containing, toxic, contaminants, and, sold, illegally, for, cooking, its, origin, is, frequently, brown, grease, from, garbage, in, kenya, thieves, sell, stolen, electric, transformers, to, operators, of, roadside, food, stalls, for, reuse, of, the, oil, in, deep, frying, suitable, for, prolonged, use, longer, than, regular, cooking, oil, but, a, threat, to, consumer, health, due, to, the, presence, of, pcbs, and, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons
