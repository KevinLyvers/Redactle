a, beard, is, the, hair, that, grows, on, the, jaw, chin, upper, lip, lower, lip, cheeks, and, neck, of, humans, and, some, non, human, animals, in, humans, usually, pubescent, or, adult, males, are, able, to, start, growing, beards, on, average, at, the, age, of, 21, throughout, the, course, of, human, history, societal, attitudes, toward, male, beards, have, varied, widely, depending, on, factors, such, as, prevailing, cultural, traditions, and, the, current, era, s, fashion, trends, several, religions, have, considered, a, full, beard, to, be, essential, and, mandate, it, as, part, of, their, observance, other, cultures, even, while, not, officially, mandating, it, view, a, beard, as, central, to, a, man, s, virility, exemplifying, such, virtues, as, virtue, beauty, wisdom, strength, fertility, sexual, prowess, and, high, social, status, in, cultures, where, facial, hair, is, uncommon, or, currently, out, of, fashion, beards, may, be, associated, with, poor, hygiene, or, an, unconventional, demeanor, in, countries, with, colder, climates, beards, help, protect, the, wearer, s, face, from, the, elements, beards, also, provide, sun, protection, the, beard, develops, in, human, males, during, puberty, beard, growth, is, linked, to, stimulation, of, hair, follicles, in, the, area, by, dihydrotestosterone, which, continues, to, affect, beard, growth, after, puberty, dihydrotestosterone, also, promotes, balding, dihydrotestosterone, is, produced, from, testosterone, the, levels, of, which, vary, with, season, beard, growth, rate, is, also, genetic, biologists, characterize, beards, as, a, secondary, sexual, characteristic, because, they, are, mostly, unique, to, one, sex, yet, do, not, play, a, direct, role, in, reproduction, charles, darwin, first, suggested, a, possible, evolutionary, explanation, of, beards, in, his, work, the, descent, of, man, which, hypothesized, that, the, process, of, sexual, selection, may, have, led, to, beards, modern, biologists, have, reaffirmed, the, role, of, sexual, selection, in, the, evolution, of, beards, concluding, that, there, is, evidence, that, a, majority, of, women, find, men, with, beards, more, attractive, than, men, without, beards, evolutionary, psychology, explanations, for, the, existence, of, beards, include, signalling, sexual, maturity, and, signalling, dominance, by, the, increasing, perceived, size, of, jaws, clean, shaved, faces, are, rated, less, dominant, than, bearded, some, scholars, assert, that, it, is, not, yet, established, whether, the, sexual, selection, leading, to, beards, is, rooted, in, attractiveness, inter, sexual, selection, or, dominance, intra, sexual, selection, a, beard, can, be, explained, as, an, indicator, of, a, male, s, overall, condition, the, rate, of, facial, hairiness, appears, to, influence, male, attractiveness, the, presence, of, a, beard, makes, the, male, vulnerable, in, hand, to, hand, fights, it, provides, an, easy, way, to, grab, and, hold, the, opponent, s, head, which, is, costly, so, biologists, have, speculated, that, there, must, be, other, evolutionary, benefits, that, outweigh, that, drawback, excess, testosterone, evidenced, by, the, beard, may, indicate, mild, immunosuppression, which, may, support, spermatogenesis, beard, hair, is, most, commonly, removed, by, shaving, or, by, trimming, with, the, use, of, a, beard, trimmer, if, only, the, area, above, the, upper, lip, is, left, unshaven, the, resulting, facial, hairstyle, is, known, as, a, mustache, if, hair, is, left, only, on, the, chin, the, style, is, a, goatee, for, appearance, and, cleanliness, some, people, maintain, their, beards, by, exfoliating, the, skin, using, soap, or, shampoo, and, sometimes, conditioner, and, afterward, applying, oils, for, softness, phoenicia, the, ancient, semitic, civilization, centered, on, the, coastline, of, what, is, today, lebanon, gave, great, attention, to, the, hair, and, beard, it, was, arranged, in, three, four, or, five, rows, of, small, tight, curls, and, extended, from, ear, to, ear, around, the, cheeks, and, chin, sometimes, however, in, lieu, of, the, many, rows, we, find, one, row, only, the, beard, falling, in, tresses, curled, at, the, extremity, there, is, no, indication, of, the, phoenicians, having, cultivated, mustachios, israelite, society, placed, a, special, importance, on, the, beard, many, male, religious, figures, mentioned, in, the, tanakh, are, recorded, to, have, had, facial, hair, according, to, biblical, scholars, the, shaving, of, hair, particularly, of, the, corners, of, the, beard, was, a, mourning, custom, the, religious, cultivation, of, beards, by, israelites, may, have, been, done, as, a, deliberate, attempt, to, distinguish, their, behaviour, in, comparison, to, their, neighbours, reducing, the, impact, of, foreign, customs, and, religion, as, a, result, the, hittites, and, elamites, were, clean, shaven, and, the, sumerians, were, also, frequently, without, a, beard, conversely, the, egyptians, and, libyans, shaved, the, beard, into, very, stylised, elongated, goatees, mesopotamian, civilizations, sumerian, assyrians, babylonians, chaldeans, and, medians, devoted, great, care, to, oiling, and, dressing, their, beards, using, tongs, and, curling, irons, to, create, elaborate, ringlets, and, tiered, patterns, the, highest, ranking, ancient, egyptians, grew, hair, on, their, chins, which, was, often, dyed, a, reddish, orange, with, henna, and, sometimes, plaited, with, an, interwoven, gold, thread, a, metal, false, beard, or, postiche, which, was, a, sign, of, sovereignty, was, worn, by, queens, and, kings, this, was, held, in, place, by, a, ribbon, tied, over, the, head, and, attached, to, a, gold, chin, strap, a, fashion, existing, from, about, 3000, to, 1580, bce, the, ancient, greeks, regarded, the, beard, as, a, badge, or, sign, of, virility, in, the, homeric, epics, it, had, almost, sanctified, significance, so, that, a, common, form, of, entreaty, was, to, touch, the, beard, of, the, person, addressed, according, to, william, smith, in, these, ancient, times, the, moustache, was, shaven, leaving, clear, the, space, around, the, lips, it, was, only, shaven, as, a, sign, of, mourning, though, in, this, case, it, was, instead, often, left, untrimmed, a, smooth, face, was, regarded, as, a, sign, of, effeminacy, the, spartans, punished, cowards, by, shaving, off, a, portion, of, their, beards, greek, beards, were, also, frequently, curled, with, tongs, youngsters, usually, did, not, grow, a, beard, moreover, wearing, a, beard, became, optional, for, adults, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, century, bce, in, ancient, macedonia, during, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, the, custom, of, smooth, shaving, was, introduced, alexander, strongly, promoted, shaving, during, his, reign, because, he, believed, it, looked, tidier, reportedly, alexander, ordered, his, soldiers, to, be, clean, shaven, fearing, that, their, beards, would, serve, as, handles, for, their, enemies, to, grab, and, hold, onto, the, practice, of, shaving, spread, from, the, macedonians, whose, kings, are, represented, on, coins, statues, etc, with, smooth, faces, throughout, the, whole, known, world, of, the, macedonian, empire, laws, were, passed, against, it, without, effect, at, rhodes, and, byzantium, even, aristotle, conformed, to, the, new, custom, unlike, the, other, philosophers, who, retained, the, beard, as, a, badge, of, their, profession, due, to, this, a, man, with, a, beard, after, the, macedonian, period, implied, a, philosopher, there, are, many, allusions, to, this, custom, of, the, later, philosophers, in, such, proverbs, as, the, beard, does, not, make, the, sage, due, to, this, association, with, philosophers, who, lost, reputation, over, time, the, beard, acquired, more, and, more, a, negative, connotation, as, in, theodore, prodromos, lucian, of, samosata, and, julian, the, apostate, who, wrote, the, misopogon, i, e, beard, hater, shaving, seems, to, have, not, been, known, to, the, romans, during, their, early, history, under, the, kings, of, rome, and, the, early, republic, pliny, tells, us, that, p, ticinius, was, the, first, who, brought, a, barber, to, rome, which, was, in, the, 454th, year, from, the, founding, of, the, city, that, is, around, 299, bce, scipio, africanus, 236, 183, bce, was, apparently, the, first, among, the, romans, who, shaved, his, beard, however, after, that, point, shaving, seems, to, have, caught, on, very, quickly, and, soon, almost, all, roman, men, were, clean, shaven, being, clean, shaven, became, a, sign, of, being, roman, and, not, greek, only, in, the, later, times, of, the, republic, did, the, roman, youth, begin, shaving, their, beards, only, partially, trimming, it, into, an, ornamental, form, prepubescent, boys, oiled, their, chins, in, hopes, of, forcing, premature, growth, of, a, beard, still, beards, remained, rare, among, the, romans, throughout, the, late, republic, and, the, early, principate, in, a, general, way, in, rome, at, this, time, a, long, beard, was, considered, a, mark, of, slovenliness, and, squalor, the, censors, l, veturius, and, p, licinius, compelled, m, livius, who, had, been, banished, on, his, restoration, to, the, city, to, be, shaved, to, lay, aside, his, dirty, appearance, and, then, but, not, until, then, to, come, into, the, senate, the, first, occasion, of, shaving, was, regarded, as, the, beginning, of, manhood, and, the, day, on, which, this, took, place, was, celebrated, as, a, festival, usually, this, was, done, when, the, young, roman, assumed, the, toga, virilis, augustus, did, it, in, his, twenty, fourth, year, caligula, in, his, twentieth, the, hair, cut, off, on, such, occasions, was, consecrated, to, a, god, thus, nero, put, his, into, a, golden, box, set, with, pearls, and, dedicated, it, to, jupiter, capitolinus, the, romans, unlike, the, greeks, let, their, beards, grow, in, time, of, mourning, so, did, augustus, for, the, death, of, julius, caesar, other, occasions, of, mourning, on, which, the, beard, was, allowed, to, grow, were, appearance, as, a, reus, condemnation, or, some, public, calamity, on, the, other, hand, men, of, the, country, areas, around, rome, in, the, time, of, varro, seem, not, to, have, shaved, except, when, they, came, to, market, every, eighth, day, so, that, their, usual, appearance, was, most, likely, a, short, stubble, in, the, second, century, ce, the, emperor, hadrian, r, 117, 138, according, to, dio, cassius, was, the, first, emperor, to, grow, a, full, beard, plutarch, says, that, he, did, it, to, hide, scars, on, his, face, this, was, a, period, in, rome, of, widespread, imitation, of, greek, culture, and, many, other, men, grew, beards, in, imitation, of, hadrian, and, the, greek, fashion, until, the, time, of, constantine, the, great, r, 306, 337, all, adult, emperors, appear, in, busts, and, coins, with, beards, but, constantine, and, his, successors, until, the, reign, of, phocas, r, 602, 610, with, the, exception, of, julian, the, apostate, r, 361, 363, are, represented, as, beardless, in, greco, roman, antiquity, the, beard, was, seen, as, the, defining, characteristic, of, the, philosopher, philosophers, had, to, have, beards, and, anyone, with, a, beard, was, assumed, to, be, a, philosopher, while, one, may, be, tempted, to, think, that, socrates, and, plato, sported, philosopher, s, beards, such, is, not, the, case, shaving, was, not, widespread, in, athens, during, fifth, and, fourth, century, bce, and, so, they, would, not, be, distinguished, from, the, general, populace, for, having, a, beard, the, popularity, of, shaving, did, not, rise, in, the, region, until, the, example, of, alexander, the, great, near, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, bce, the, popularity, of, shaving, did, not, spread, to, rome, until, the, end, of, the, third, century, bce, following, its, acceptance, by, scipio, africanus, in, rome, shaving, s, popularity, grew, to, the, point, that, for, a, respectable, roman, citizen, it, was, seen, almost, as, compulsory, the, idea, of, the, philosopher, s, beard, gained, traction, when, in, 155, bce, three, philosophers, arrived, in, rome, as, greek, diplomats, carneades, head, of, the, platonic, academy, critolaus, of, aristotle, s, lyceum, and, the, head, of, the, stoics, diogenes, of, babylon, in, contrast, to, their, beautifully, clean, shaven, italian, audience, these, three, intellectuals, all, sported, magnificent, beards, thus, the, connection, of, beards, and, philosophy, caught, hold, of, the, roman, public, imagination, the, importance, of, the, beard, to, roman, philosophers, is, best, seen, by, the, extreme, value, that, the, stoic, philosopher, epictetus, placed, on, it, as, historian, john, sellars, puts, it, epictetus, affirmed, the, philosopher, s, beard, as, something, almost, sacred, to, express, the, idea, that, philosophy, is, no, mere, intellectual, hobby, but, rather, a, way, of, life, that, by, definition, transforms, every, aspect, of, one, s, behavior, including, one, s, shaving, habits, if, someone, continues, to, shave, in, order, to, look, the, part, of, a, respectable, roman, citizen, it, is, clear, that, they, have, not, yet, embraced, philosophy, conceived, as, a, way, of, life, and, have, not, yet, escaped, the, social, customs, of, the, majority, the, true, philosopher, will, only, act, according, to, reason, or, according, to, nature, rejecting, the, arbitrary, conventions, that, guide, the, behavior, of, everyone, else, epictetus, saw, his, beard, as, an, integral, part, of, his, identity, and, held, that, he, would, rather, be, executed, than, submit, to, any, force, demanding, he, remove, it, in, his, discourses, 1, 2, 29, he, puts, forward, such, a, hypothetical, confrontation, come, now, epictetus, shave, your, beard, if, i, am, a, philosopher, i, answer, i, will, not, shave, it, off, then, i, will, have, you, beheaded, if, it, will, do, you, any, good, behead, me, the, act, of, shaving, would, be, to, compromise, his, philosophical, ideal, of, living, in, accordance, with, nature, and, it, would, be, to, submit, to, the, unjustified, authority, of, another, this, was, not, theoretical, in, the, age, of, epictetus, for, the, emperor, domitian, had, the, hair, and, beard, forcibly, shaven, off, of, the, philosopher, apollonius, of, tyana, as, punishment, for, anti, state, activities, this, disgraced, apollonius, while, avoiding, making, him, a, martyr, like, socrates, well, before, his, declaration, of, death, before, shaving, epictetus, had, been, forced, to, flee, rome, when, domitian, banished, all, philosophers, from, italy, under, threat, of, execution, roman, philosophers, sported, different, styles, of, beards, to, distinguish, which, school, they, belonged, to, cynics, with, long, dirty, beards, to, indicate, their, strict, indifference, to, all, external, goods, and, social, customs, stoics, occasionally, trimming, and, washing, their, beards, in, accordance, with, their, view, that, it, is, acceptable, to, prefer, certain, external, goods, so, long, as, they, are, never, valued, above, virtue, peripatetics, took, great, care, of, their, beards, believing, in, accordance, with, aristotle, that, external, goods, and, social, status, were, necessary, for, the, good, life, together, with, virtue, to, a, roman, philosopher, in, this, era, having, a, beard, and, its, condition, indicated, their, commitment, to, live, in, accordance, with, their, philosophy, late, hellenistic, sculptures, of, celts, portray, them, with, long, hair, and, mustaches, but, beardless, caesar, reported, the, britons, wore, no, beard, except, upon, the, upper, lip, the, anglo, saxons, on, arrival, in, great, britain, wore, beards, and, continued, to, do, so, for, a, considerable, time, after, among, the, gaelic, celts, of, scotland, and, ireland, men, typically, let, their, facial, hair, grow, into, a, full, beard, and, it, was, often, seen, as, dishonourable, for, a, gaelic, man, to, have, no, facial, hair, tacitus, states, that, among, the, catti, a, germanic, tribe, perhaps, the, chatten, a, young, man, was, not, allowed, to, shave, or, cut, his, hair, until, he, had, slain, an, enemy, the, lombards, derived, their, name, from, the, great, length, of, their, beards, longobards, long, beards, when, otto, the, great, said, anything, serious, he, swore, by, his, beard, which, covered, his, breast, in, medieval, europe, a, beard, displayed, a, knight, s, virility, and, honour, the, castilian, knight, el, cid, is, described, in, the, lay, of, the, cid, as, the, one, with, the, flowery, beard, holding, somebody, else, s, beard, was, a, serious, offence, that, had, to, be, righted, in, a, duel, the, punishment, for, pulling, off, someone, else, s, beard, was, the, same, as, for, castrating, him, while, most, noblemen, and, knights, were, bearded, the, catholic, clergy, were, generally, required, to, be, clean, shaven, this, was, understood, as, a, symbol, of, their, celibacy, in, pre, islamic, arabia, arabian, men, would, apparently, shorten, their, beards, and, keep, big, mustachios, muhammad, encouraged, his, followers, to, do, the, opposite, to, grow, their, beards, and, trim, their, moustaches, to, differ, with, the, non, believers, this, style, of, beard, subsequently, spread, along, with, islam, during, the, muslim, expansion, in, the, middle, ages, most, chinese, emperors, of, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, appear, with, beards, or, mustaches, in, portraits, in, the, 15th, century, most, european, men, in, both, the, church, and, the, nobility, were, clean, shaven, in, the, 16th, century, beards, became, fashionable, particularly, following, the, reformation, where, many, rulers, nobles, and, religious, reformers, grew, long, beards, to, distinguish, themselves, from, the, usually, clean, shaven, catholic, clergy, by, the, mid, 16th, century, most, catholic, clergy, also, adopted, beards, every, pope, from, clement, vii, to, innocent, xii, would, also, sport, facial, hair, some, other, beards, of, this, time, were, the, spanish, spade, beard, the, english, square, cut, beard, the, forked, beard, and, the, stiletto, beard, in, 1587, francis, drake, claimed, in, a, figure, of, speech, to, have, singed, the, king, of, spain, s, beard, during, the, chinese, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1911, the, ruling, manchu, minority, were, either, clean, shaven, or, at, most, wore, mustaches, in, contrast, to, the, han, majority, who, still, wore, beards, in, keeping, with, the, confucian, ideal, in, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, the, size, of, beards, decreased, in, urban, circles, of, western, europe, with, the, shape, also, becoming, more, pointed, by, the, middle, of, the, century, men, usually, wore, a, mustache, or, a, pointed, goatee, in, the, later, part, of, the, century, being, clean, shaven, gradually, became, more, common, again, amongst, the, upper, classes, so, much, so, that, in, 1698, peter, the, great, of, russia, ordered, men, to, shave, off, their, beards, and, in, 1705, levied, a, tax, on, beards, in, order, to, bring, russian, society, more, in, line, with, contemporary, western, europe, throughout, the, 18th, century, essentially, all, upper, class, and, most, middle, class, european, men, would, be, clean, shaven, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, after, the, french, revolution, attitudes, began, to, turn, away, from, the, upper, class, fashions, of, the, previous, century, particularly, among, the, lower, classes, during, the, early, 19th, century, most, men, particularly, amongst, the, nobility, and, upper, classes, went, clean, shaven, however, the, shifts, which, had, begun, during, the, revolutionary, period, began, to, creep, their, way, into, first, the, middle, and, then, the, upper, classes, and, this, included, the, gradual, return, of, facial, hair, this, is, seen, in, the, 1810s, and, 1820s, with, many, men, adopting, sideburns, or, side, whiskers, which, gradually, grew, in, size, in, the, ensuing, decades, facial, hair, also, became, more, common, amongst, western, armies, during, this, period, with, the, regimental, mustache, becoming, a, common, association, with, the, soldiers, of, the, time, this, was, followed, by, a, dramatic, shift, in, the, beard, s, popularity, following, the, crimean, war, during, the, 1850s, with, it, becoming, markedly, more, popular, consequently, beards, were, adopted, by, many, leaders, such, as, alexander, iii, of, russia, napoleon, iii, of, france, and, frederick, iii, of, germany, as, well, as, many, leading, statesmen, and, cultural, figures, such, as, benjamin, disraeli, charles, dickens, giuseppe, garibaldi, karl, marx, and, giuseppe, verdi, this, trend, can, be, recognised, in, the, united, states, of, america, where, the, shift, can, be, seen, amongst, the, post, civil, war, presidents, before, abraham, lincoln, no, president, had, a, beard, after, lincoln, until, woodrow, wilson, every, president, except, andrew, johnson, and, william, mckinley, had, either, a, beard, or, a, moustache, the, beard, became, linked, in, this, period, with, notions, of, masculinity, and, male, courage, the, resulting, popularity, has, contributed, to, the, stereotypical, victorian, male, figure, in, the, popular, mind, the, stern, figure, clothed, in, black, whose, gravitas, is, added, to, by, a, heavy, beard, in, china, the, revolution, of, 1911, and, subsequent, may, fourth, movement, of, 1919, led, the, chinese, to, idealize, the, west, as, more, modern, and, progressive, than, themselves, this, included, the, realm, of, fashion, and, chinese, men, began, shaving, their, faces, and, cutting, their, hair, short, by, the, early, twentieth, century, beards, began, a, slow, decline, in, popularity, although, retained, by, some, prominent, figures, who, were, young, men, in, the, victorian, period, like, sigmund, freud, most, men, who, retained, facial, hair, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, limited, themselves, to, a, moustache, or, a, goatee, such, as, with, marcel, proust, albert, einstein, vladimir, lenin, leon, trotsky, adolf, hitler, and, joseph, stalin, in, the, united, states, meanwhile, popular, movies, portrayed, heroes, with, clean, shaven, faces, and, crew, cuts, concurrently, the, psychological, mass, marketing, of, edward, bernays, and, madison, avenue, was, becoming, prevalent, the, gillette, safety, razor, company, was, one, of, these, marketers, early, clients, these, events, conspired, to, popularize, short, hair, and, clean, shaven, faces, as, the, only, acceptable, style, for, decades, to, come, the, few, men, who, wore, the, beard, or, portions, of, the, beard, during, this, period, were, usually, either, old, central, european, members, of, a, religious, sect, that, required, it, or, in, academia, this, case, of, affairs, would, last, all, the, way, until, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, the, beard, was, reintroduced, to, mainstream, society, by, the, counterculture, firstly, with, the, beatniks, in, the, 1950s, and, then, with, the, hippie, movement, of, the, mid, 1960s, following, the, vietnam, war, facial, hair, exploded, in, popularity, in, the, mid, late, 1960s, and, throughout, the, 1970s, beards, were, worn, by, hippies, and, businessmen, alike, popular, musicians, like, the, beatles, barry, white, the, beach, boys, jim, morrison, lead, singer, of, the, doors, and, the, male, members, of, peter, paul, and, mary, among, many, others, wore, full, beards, or, mustaches, the, trend, of, seemingly, ubiquitous, facial, hair, in, american, culture, subsided, by, the, beginning, of, the, 1980s, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, closely, clipped, verdi, beard, often, with, a, matching, integrated, moustache, had, become, relatively, common, from, the, 1990s, onward, fashion, in, the, united, states, has, generally, trended, toward, either, a, goatee, van, dyke, or, a, closely, cropped, full, beard, undercut, on, the, throat, by, 2010, the, fashionable, length, approached, a, two, day, shadow, the, 2010s, decade, also, saw, the, full, beard, become, fashionable, again, amongst, young, hipster, men, and, a, huge, increase, in, the, sales, of, male, grooming, products, one, stratum, of, american, society, where, facial, hair, was, long, rare, is, in, government, and, politics, the, last, president, of, the, united, states, to, wear, any, type, of, facial, hair, was, william, howard, taft, who, was, in, office, from, 1909, to, 1913, the, last, vice, president, of, the, united, states, to, wear, any, facial, hair, was, charles, curtis, who, was, in, office, from, 1929, to, 1933, both, of, whom, wore, moustaches, but, the, last, president, of, the, united, states, to, wear, a, beard, was, benjamin, harrison, who, was, in, office, from, 1889, to, 1893, the, last, member, of, the, united, states,

that, during, the, reformation, era, many, protestant, reformers, decided, to, grow, their, beards, in, order, to, emphasize, their, break, with, the, catholic, tradition, it, was, a, break, from,

campaign, to, loosen, the, beard, restrictions, in, 2014, but, it, had, the, opposite, effect, at, church, educational, system, schools, some, who, had, previously, been, granted, beard, exemptions, were, found, no, longer, to, qualify, and, for, a, brief, period, the, lds, business, college, required, students, with, a, registered, exemption, to, wear, a, beard, badge, which, was, likened, to,

in, sunn, islamic, jurisprudence, there, are, three, scholarly, opinions, on, the, beard, according, to, the, islamic, tradition, sunnah, the, first, one, is, that, growing, the, beard, is, obligatory, and, that, shaving, it, is, haram, forbidden, with, the, main, source, for, this, position, being, this, narration, sahih, bukhari, book, 72, hadith, 781, usc, msa, narrated, by, ibn, umar, allah, s, apostle, said, cut, the, moustaches, short, and, leave, the, beard, as, it, is, the, second, one, which, is, the, official, position, of, the, sh, fi, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, asserts, that, the, beard, is, only, mustahabb, recommended, and, shaving, the, beard, is, only, makruh, disliked, but, not, haram, forbidden, the, third, one, among, some, contemporary, sunn, muslim, scholars, such, as, the, grand, mufti, of, egypt, shawki, allam, is, that, keeping, the, beard, is, permissible, and, that, shaving, it, is, also, permissible, according, to, the, twelver, denomination, of, sh, a, islam, as, per, sunnah, custom, the, length, of, a, beard, should, not, exceed, the, width, of, a, fist, trimming, of, facial, hair, is, allowed, however, shaving, it, is, haram, forbidden, about, the, permissible, size, of, it, according, to, a, few, sh, te, marjia, such, as, seyyed, ali, khamenei, seyyed, ali, sistani, and, others, if, this, its, size, is, urfly, applicable, true, of, beard, it, will, not, be, haram, talmudic, tradition, holds, that, a, man, may, not, shave, his, beard, with, a, razor, with, a, single, blade, since, the, cutting, action, of, the, blade, against, the, skin, mars, the, beard, because, scissors, have, two, blades, some, opinions, in, halakha, jewish, law, permit, their, use, to, trim, the, beard, as, the, cutting, action, comes, from, contact, of, the, two, blades, and, not, the, blade, against, the, skin, for, this, reason, some, poskim, jewish, legal, deciders, rule, that, orthodox, jews, may, use, electric, razors, to, remain, clean, shaven, as, such, shavers, cut, by, trapping, the, hair, between, the, blades, and, the, metal, grating, halakhically, a, scissor, like, action, however, other, poskim, maintain, that, electric, shavers, constitute, a, razor, style, action, and, consequently, prohibit, their, use, the, torah, forbids, certain, shaving, practices, altogether, in, particular, leviticus, 19, 27, states, you, must, not, round, off, the, hair, at, the, sides, of, your, head, or, destroy, the, corners, of, your, beard, the, mishnah, interprets, this, as, a, prohibition, on, using, a, razor, on, the, beard, this, prohibition, is, further, expanded, upon, in, the, kabbalistic, literature, the, prohibition, carries, to, modern, judaism, to, this, day, with, rabbinic, opinions, traditionally, forbidding, the, use, of, a, razor, to, shave, between, the, five, corners, of, the, beard, although, there, is, no, uniform, consensus, on, where, these, five, vertices, are, located, moses, maimonides, criticized, the, shaving, of, the, beard, as, being, the, custom, of, idolatrous, priests, the, zohar, one, of, the, primary, sources, of, kabbalah, jewish, mysticism, attributes, sacred, to, the, beard, specifying, that, hairs, of, the, beard, symbolize, channels, of, subconscious, holy, energy, that, flows, from, above, to, the, human, soul, therefore, most, hasidic, jews, for, whom, kabbalah, plays, an, important, role, in, their, religious, practice, traditionally, do, not, remove, or, even, trim, their, beards, traditional, jews, refrain, from, shaving, trimming, the, beard, and, haircuts, during, certain, times, of, the, year, like, passover, sukkot, the, counting, of, the, omer, and, the, three, weeks, cutting, the, hair, is, also,
