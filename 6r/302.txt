chess, is, a, board, game, for, two, players, it, is, sometimes, called, international, chess, or, western, chess, to, distinguish, it, from, related, games, such, as, xiangqi, chinese, chess, and, shogi, japanese, chess, chess, is, an, abstract, strategy, game, that, involves, no, hidden, information, and, no, elements, of, chance, it, is, played, on, a, chessboard, with, 64, squares, arranged, in, an, 8, 8, grid, the, players, referred, to, as, white, and, black, each, control, sixteen, pieces, one, king, one, queen, two, rooks, two, bishops, two, knights, and, eight, pawns, white, moves, first, followed, by, black, the, game, is, typically, won, by, checkmating, the, opponent, s, king, i, e, threatening, it, with, inescapable, capture, there, are, several, ways, a, game, can, end, in, a, draw, the, recorded, history, of, chess, goes, back, at, least, to, the, emergence, of, a, similar, game, chaturanga, in, seventh, century, india, after, its, introduction, in, persia, it, spread, to, the, arab, world, and, then, to, europe, the, rules, of, chess, as, they, are, known, today, emerged, in, europe, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, with, standardization, and, universal, acceptance, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, today, chess, is, one, of, the, world, s, most, popular, games, and, is, played, by, millions, of, people, worldwide, organized, chess, arose, in, the, 19th, century, chess, competition, today, is, governed, internationally, by, fide, f, d, ration, internationale, des, checs, the, international, chess, federation, the, first, universally, recognized, world, chess, champion, wilhelm, steinitz, claimed, his, title, in, 1886, ding, liren, is, the, current, world, champion, a, huge, body, of, chess, theory, has, developed, since, the, game, s, inception, aspects, of, art, are, found, in, chess, composition, and, chess, in, its, turn, influenced, western, culture, and, the, arts, and, has, connections, with, other, fields, such, as, mathematics, computer, science, and, psychology, one, of, the, goals, of, early, computer, scientists, was, to, create, a, chess, playing, machine, in, 1997, deep, blue, became, the, first, computer, to, beat, the, reigning, world, champion, in, a, match, when, it, defeated, garry, kasparov, today, s, chess, engines, are, significantly, stronger, than, the, best, human, players, and, have, deeply, influenced, the, development, of, chess, theory, however, chess, is, not, a, solved, game, the, rules, of, chess, are, published, by, fide, f, d, ration, internationale, des, checs, international, chess, federation, chess, s, world, governing, body, in, its, handbook, rules, published, by, national, governing, bodies, or, by, unaffiliated, chess, organizations, commercial, publishers, etc, may, differ, in, some, details, fide, s, rules, were, most, recently, revised, in, 2023, chess, sets, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, styles, the, staunton, pattern, is, the, most, common, and, is, usually, required, for, competition, chess, pieces, are, divided, into, two, sets, usually, light, and, dark, colored, referred, to, as, white, and, black, regardless, of, the, actual, color, or, design, the, players, of, the, sets, are, referred, to, as, white, and, black, respectively, each, set, consists, of, sixteen, pieces, one, king, one, queen, two, rooks, two, bishops, two, knights, and, eight, pawns, the, game, is, played, on, a, square, board, of, eight, rows, called, ranks, and, eight, columns, called, files, by, convention, the, 64, squares, alternate, in, color, and, are, referred, to, as, light, and, dark, squares, common, colors, for, chessboards, are, white, and, brown, or, white, and, green, the, pieces, are, set, out, as, shown, in, the, diagram, and, photo, thus, on, white, s, first, rank, from, left, to, right, the, pieces, are, placed, as, follows, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook, eight, pawns, are, placed, on, the, second, rank, black, s, position, mirrors, white, s, with, an, equivalent, piece, on, the, same, file, the, board, is, placed, with, a, light, square, at, the, right, hand, corner, nearest, to, each, player, the, correct, position, of, the, light, square, may, be, remembered, by, the, phrase, light, on, right, while, the, correct, positions, of, the, king, and, queen, may, be, remembered, by, the, phrase, queen, on, her, own, color, i, e, the, white, queen, begins, on, a, light, square, and, the, black, queen, on, a, dark, square, in, competitive, games, the, piece, colors, are, allocated, to, players, by, the, organizers, in, informal, games, the, colors, are, usually, decided, randomly, for, example, by, a, coin, toss, or, by, one, player, concealing, a, white, pawn, in, one, hand, and, a, black, pawn, in, the, other, and, having, the, opponent, choose, white, moves, first, after, which, players, alternate, turns, moving, one, piece, per, turn, except, for, castling, when, two, pieces, are, moved, a, piece, is, moved, to, either, an, unoccupied, square, or, one, occupied, by, an, opponent, s, piece, which, is, captured, and, removed, from, play, with, the, sole, exception, of, en, passant, all, pieces, capture, by, moving, to, the, square, that, the, opponent, s, piece, occupies, moving, is, compulsory, a, player, may, not, skip, a, turn, even, when, having, to, move, is, detrimental, each, piece, has, its, own, way, of, moving, in, the, diagrams, crosses, mark, the, squares, to, which, the, piece, can, move, if, there, are, no, intervening, piece, s, of, either, color, except, the, knight, which, leaps, over, any, intervening, pieces, all, pieces, except, the, pawn, can, capture, an, enemy, piece, if, it, is, on, a, square, to, which, they, could, move, if, the, square, were, unoccupied, pieces, are, generally, not, permitted, to, move, through, squares, occupied, by, pieces, of, either, color, except, for, the, knight, and, during, castling, when, a, king, is, under, immediate, attack, it, is, said, to, be, in, check, a, move, in, response, to, a, check, is, legal, only, if, it, results, in, a, position, where, the, king, is, no, longer, in, check, there, are, three, ways, to, counter, a, check, castling, is, not, a, permissible, response, to, a, check, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, checkmate, the, opponent, this, occurs, when, the, opponent, s, king, is, in, check, and, there, is, no, legal, way, to, get, it, out, of, check, it, is, never, legal, for, a, player, to, make, a, move, that, puts, or, leaves, the, player, s, own, king, in, check, in, casual, games, it, is, common, to, announce, check, when, putting, the, opponent, s, king, in, check, but, this, is, not, required, by, the, rules, of, chess, and, is, usually, not, done, in, tournaments, once, per, game, each, king, can, make, a, move, known, as, castling, castling, consists, of, moving, the, king, two, squares, toward, a, rook, of, the, same, color, on, the, same, rank, and, then, placing, the, rook, on, the, square, that, the, king, crossed, castling, is, permissible, if, the, following, conditions, are, met, castling, is, still, permitted, if, the, rook, is, under, attack, or, if, the, rook, crosses, an, attacked, square, when, a, pawn, makes, a, two, step, advance, from, its, starting, position, and, there, is, an, opponent, s, pawn, on, a, square, next, to, the, destination, square, on, an, adjacent, file, then, the, opponent, s, pawn, can, capture, it, en, passant, in, passing, moving, to, the, square, the, pawn, passed, over, this, can, be, done, only, on, the, turn, immediately, following, the, enemy, pawn, s, two, square, advance, otherwise, the, right, to, do, so, is, forfeited, for, example, in, the, animated, diagram, the, black, pawn, advances, two, squares, from, g7, to, g5, and, the, white, pawn, on, f5, can, take, it, en, passant, on, g6, but, only, immediately, after, the, black, pawn, s, advance, when, a, pawn, advances, to, its, eighth, rank, as, part, of, the, move, it, is, promoted, and, must, be, exchanged, for, the, player, s, choice, of, queen, rook, bishop, or, knight, of, the, same, color, usually, the, pawn, is, chosen, to, be, promoted, to, a, queen, but, in, some, cases, another, piece, is, chosen, this, is, called, underpromotion, in, the, animated, diagram, the, pawn, on, c7, can, be, advanced, to, the, eighth, rank, and, be, promoted, there, is, no, restriction, on, the, piece, promoted, to, so, it, is, possible, to, have, more, pieces, of, the, same, type, than, at, the, start, of, the, game, e, g, two, or, more, queens, if, the, required, piece, is, not, available, e, g, a, second, queen, an, inverted, rook, is, sometimes, used, as, a, substitute, but, this, is, not, recognized, in, fide, sanctioned, games, a, game, can, be, won, in, the, following, ways, there, are, several, ways, a, game, can, end, in, a, draw, in, competition, chess, games, are, played, with, a, time, control, if, a, player, s, time, runs, out, before, the, game, is, completed, the, game, is, automatically, lost, provided, the, opponent, has, enough, pieces, left, to, deliver, checkmate, the, duration, of, a, game, ranges, from, long, or, classical, games, which, can, take, up, to, seven, hours, even, longer, if, adjournments, are, permitted, to, bullet, chess, under, 3, minutes, per, player, for, the, entire, game, intermediate, between, these, are, rapid, chess, games, lasting, between, one, and, two, hours, per, game, a, popular, time, control, in, amateur, weekend, tournaments, time, is, controlled, using, a, chess, clock, that, has, two, displays, one, for, each, player, s, remaining, time, analog, chess, clocks, have, been, largely, replaced, by, digital, clocks, which, allow, for, time, controls, with, increments, time, controls, are, also, enforced, in, correspondence, chess, competitions, a, typical, time, control, is, 50, days, for, every, 10, moves, historically, many, different, notation, systems, have, been, used, to, record, chess, moves, the, standard, system, today, is, short, form, algebraic, notation, in, this, system, each, square, is, uniquely, identified, by, a, set, of, coordinates, a, h, for, the, files, followed, by, 1, 8, for, the, ranks, the, usual, format, is, the, pieces, are, identified, by, their, initials, in, english, these, are, k, king, q, queen, r, rook, b, bishop, and, n, knight, n, is, used, to, avoid, confusion, with, king, for, example, qg5, means, queen, moves, to, the, g, file, 5th, rank, that, is, to, the, square, g5, different, initials, may, be, used, for, other, languages, in, chess, literature, figurine, algebraic, notation, fan, is, frequently, used, to, aid, understanding, independent, of, language, to, resolve, ambiguities, an, additional, letter, or, number, is, added, to, indicate, the, file, or, rank, from, which, the, piece, moved, e, g, ngf3, means, knight, from, the, g, file, moves, to, the, square, f3, r1e2, means, rook, on, the, first, rank, moves, to, e2, for, pawns, no, letter, initial, is, used, so, e4, means, pawn, moves, to, the, square, e4, if, the, piece, makes, a, capture, x, is, usually, inserted, before, the, destination, square, thus, bxf3, means, bishop, captures, on, f3, when, a, pawn, makes, a, capture, the, file, from, which, the, pawn, departed, is, used, to, identify, the, pawn, making, the, capture, for, example, exd5, pawn, on, the, e, file, captures, the, piece, on, d5, ranks, may, be, omitted, if, unambiguous, for, example, exd, pawn, on, the, e, file, captures, a, piece, somewhere, on, the, d, file, a, minority, of, publications, use, to, indicate, a, capture, and, some, omit, the, capture, symbol, altogether, in, its, most, abbreviated, form, exd5, may, be, rendered, simply, as, ed, an, en, passant, capture, may, optionally, be, marked, with, the, notation, e, p, if, a, pawn, moves, to, its, last, rank, achieving, promotion, the, piece, chosen, is, indicated, after, the, move, for, example, e1, q, or, e1q, castling, is, indicated, by, the, special, notations, 0, 0, or, o, o, for, kingside, castling, and, 0, 0, 0, or, o, o, o, for, queenside, castling, a, move, that, places, the, opponent, s, king, in, check, usually, has, the, notation, added, there, are, no, specific, notations, for, discovered, check, or, double, check, checkmate, can, be, indicated, by, at, the, end, of, the, game, 1, 0, means, white, won, 0, 1, means, black, won, and, indicates, a, draw, chess, moves, can, be, annotated, with, punctuation, marks, and, other, symbols, for, example, indicates, a, good, move, an, excellent, move, a, mistake, a, blunder, an, interesting, move, that, may, not, be, best, or, a, dubious, move, not, easily, refuted, for, example, one, variation, of, a, simple, trap, known, as, the, scholar, s, mate, see, animated, diagram, can, be, recorded, variants, of, algebraic, notation, include, long, algebraic, in, which, both, the, departure, and, destination, square, are, indicated, abbreviated, algebraic, in, which, capture, signs, check, signs, and, ranks, of, pawn, captures, may, be, omitted, and, figurine, algebraic, notation, used, in, chess, publications, for, universal, readability, regardless, of, language, portable, game, notation, pgn, is, a, text, based, file, format, for, recording, chess, games, based, on, short, form, english, algebraic, notation, with, a, small, amount, of, markup, pgn, files, suffix, pgn, can, be, processed, by, most, chess, software, as, well, as, being, easily, readable, by, humans, until, about, 1980, the, majority, of, english, language, chess, publications, used, descriptive, notation, in, which, files, are, identified, by, the, initial, letter, of, the, piece, that, occupies, the, first, rank, at, the, beginning, of, the, game, in, descriptive, notation, the, common, opening, move, 1, e4, is, rendered, as, 1, p, k4, pawn, to, king, four, another, system, is, iccf, numeric, notation, recognized, by, the, international, correspondence, chess, federation, though, its, use, is, in, decline, in, tournament, games, players, are, normally, required, to, keep, a, score, record, of, the, game, for, this, purpose, only, algebraic, notation, is, recognized, in, fide, sanctioned, events, game, scores, recorded, in, a, different, notation, system, may, not, be, used, as, evidence, in, the, event, of, a, dispute, chess, is, often, played, casually, in, public, spaces, such, as, parks, and, town, squares, contemporary, chess, is, an, organized, sport, with, structured, international, and, national, leagues, tournaments, and, congresses, thousands, of, chess, tournaments, matches, and, festivals, are, held, around, the, world, every, year, catering, to, players, of, all, levels, tournaments, with, a, small, number, of, players, may, use, the, round, robin, format, in, which, every, player, plays, one, game, against, every, other, player, for, a, large, number, of, players, the, swiss, system, may, be, used, in, which, each, player, is, paired, against, an, opponent, who, has, the, same, or, as, similar, as, possible, score, in, each, round, in, either, case, a, player, s, score, is, usually, calculated, as, 1, point, for, each, game, won, and, one, half, point, for, each, game, drawn, variations, such, as, football, scoring, 3, points, for, a, win, 1, point, for, a, draw, may, be, used, by, tournament, organizers, but, ratings, are, always, calculated, on, the, basis, of, standard, scoring, a, player, s, score, may, be, reported, as, total, score, out, of, games, played, e, g, 5, 8, points, for, versus, points, against, e, g, 5, 2, or, by, number, of, wins, losses, and, draws, e, g, 4, 1, 3, the, term, match, refers, not, to, an, individual, game, but, to, either, a, series, of, games, between, two, players, or, a, team, competition, in, which, each, player, of, one, team, plays, one, game, against, a, player, of, the, other, team, chess, s, international, governing, body, is, usually, known, by, its, french, acronym, fide, pronounced, fee, day, french, f, d, ration,

associate, members, including, various, supra, national, organizations, the, international, braille, chess, association, ibca, international, committee, of, chess, for, the, deaf, iccd, and, the, international, physically, disabled, chess, association, ipca, fide, is, recognized, as, a, sports, governing, body, by, the, international, olympic, committee, but, chess, has, never, been, part, of, the, olympic, games, fide, s, most, visible, activity, is, organizing, the, world, chess, championship, a, role, it, assumed, in, 1948, the, current, world, champion, is, ding, liren, of, china, the, reigning, women, s, world, champion, is, ju, wenjun, from, china, other, competitions, for, individuals, include, the, world, junior, chess, championship, the, european, individual, chess,

magnus, carlsen, on, the, march, 2014, fide, rating, list, players, may, be, awarded, lifetime, titles, by, fide, the, above, titles, are, open, to, both, men, and, women, there, are, also, separate, women, only, titles, woman, grandmaster, wgm, woman, international, master, wim, woman, fide, master, wfm, and, woman, candidate, master, wcm, these, require, a, performance, level, approximately, 200, elo, rating, points, below, the, similarly, named, open, titles, and, their, continued, existence, has, sometimes, been, controversial, beginning, with, nona, gaprindashvili, in, 1978, a, number, of, women, have, earned, the, open, gm, title, 40, as, of, july, 2023, fide, also, awards, titles, for, arbiters, and, trainers, international, titles, are, also, awarded, to, composers, and, solvers,

extensive, literature, in, 1913, the, chess, historian, h, j, r, murray, estimated, the, total, number, of, books, magazines, and, chess, columns, in, newspapers, to, be, about, 5, 000, b, h, wood, estimated, the, number, as, of, 1949, to, be, about, 20, 000, david, hooper, and, kenneth, whyld, write, that, since, then, there, has, been, a, steady, increase, year, by, year, of, the, number, of, new, chess, publications, no, one, knows, how, many, have, been, printed, significant, public, chess, libraries, include, the, john, g, white, chess, and, checkers, collection, at, cleveland, public, library, with, over, 32, 000, chess, books, and, over, 6, 000, bound, volumes, of, chess, periodicals, and, the, chess, draughts, collection, at, the, national, library, of, the, netherlands, with, about, 30, 000, books, chess, theory, usually, divides, the, game, of, chess, into, three, phases, with, different, sets, of, strategies, the, opening, typically, the, first, 10, to, 20, moves, when, players, move, their, pieces, to, useful, positions, for, the, coming, battle, the, middlegame, and, last, the, endgame, when, most, of, the, pieces, are, gone, kings, typically, take, a, more, active, part, in, the, struggle, and, pawn, promotion, is, often, decisive, opening, theory, is, concerned, with, finding, the, best, moves, in, the, initial, phase, of, the, game, there, are, dozens, of, different, openings, and, hundreds, of, variants, the, oxford, companion, to, chess, lists, 1, 327, named, openings, and, variants, middlegame, theory, is, usually, divided, into, chess, tactics, and, chess, strategy, chess, strategy, concentrates, on, setting, and, achieving, long, term, positional, advantages, during, the, game, for, example, where, to, place, different, pieces, while, tactics, concerns, immediate, maneuver, these, two, aspects, of, the, gameplay, cannot, be, completely, separated, because, strategic, goals, are, mostly, achieved, through, tactics, while, the, tactical, opportunities, are, based, on, the, previous, strategy, of, play, endgame, theory, is, concerned, with, positions, where, there, are, only, a, few, pieces, left, these, positions, are, categorized, according, to, the, pieces, for, example, king, and, pawn, endings, or, rook, versus, minor, piece, endings, a, chess, opening, is, the, group, of, initial, moves, of, a, game, the, opening, moves, recognized, sequences, of, opening, moves, are, referred, to, as, openings, and, have, been, given, names, such, as, the, ruy, lopez, or, sicilian, defense, they, are, catalogued, in, reference, works, such, as, the, encyclopaedia, of, chess, openings, there, are, dozens, of, different, openings, varying, widely, in, character, from, quiet, positional, play, for, example, the, r, ti, opening, to, very, aggressive, the, latvian, gambit, in, some, opening, lines, the, exact, sequence, considered, best, for, both, sides, has, been, worked, out, to, more, than, 30, moves, professional, players, spend, years, studying, openings, and, continue, doing, so, throughout, their, careers, as, opening, theory, continues, to, evolve, the, fundamental, strategic, aims, of, most, openings, are, similar, most, players, and, theoreticians, consider, that, white, by, virtue, of, the, first, move, begins, the, game, with, a, small, advantage, this, initially, gives, white, the, initiative, black, usually, strives, to, neutralize, white, s, advantage, and, achieve, equality, or, to, develop, dynamic, counterplay, in, an, unbalanced, position, the, middlegame, is, the, part, of, the, game, that, starts, after, the, opening, there, is, no, clear, line, between, the, opening, and, the, middlegame, but, typically, the, middlegame, will, start, when, most, pieces, have, been, developed, similarly, there, is, no, clear, transition, from, the, middlegame, to, the, endgame, see, start, of, the, endgame, because, the, opening, theory, has, ended, players, have, to, form, plans, based, on, the, features, of, the, position, and, at, the, same, time, take, into, account, the, tactical, possibilities, of, the, position, the, middlegame, is, the, phase, in, which, most, combinations, occur, combinations, are, a, series, of, tactical, moves, executed, to, achieve, some, gain, middlegame, combinations, are, often, connected, with, an, attack, against, the, opponent, s, king, some, typical, patterns, have, their, own, names, for, example, the, boden, s, mate, or, the, lasker, bauer, combination, specific, plans, or, strategic, themes, will, often, arise, from, particular, groups, of, openings, that, result, in, a, specific, type, of, pawn, structure, an, example, is, the, minority, attack, which, is, the, attack, of, queenside, pawns, against, an, opponent, who, has, more, pawns, on, the, queenside, the, study, of, openings, is, therefore, connected, to, the, preparation, of, plans, that, are, typical, of, the, resulting, middlegames, another, important, strategic, question, in, the, middlegame, is, whether, and, how, to, reduce, material, and, transition, into, an, endgame, i, e, simplify, minor, material, advantages, can, generally, be, transformed, into, victory, only, in, an, endgame, and, therefore, the, stronger, side, must, choose, an, appropriate, way, to, achieve, an, ending, not, every, reduction, of, material, is, good, for, this, purpose, for, example, if, one, side, keeps, a, light, squared, bishop, and, the, opponent, has, a, dark, squared, one, the, transformation, into, a, bishops, and, pawns, ending, is, usually, advantageous, for, the, weaker, side, only, because, an, endgame, with, bishops, on, opposite, colors, is, likely, to, be, a, draw, even, with, an, advantage, of, a, pawn, or, sometimes, even, with, a, two, pawn, advantage, in, chess, tactics, in, general, concentrate, on, short, term, actions, so, short, term, that, they, can, be, calculated, in, advance, by, a, human, player, or, a, computer, the, possible, depth, of, calculation, depends, on, the, player, s, ability, in, quiet, positions, with, many, possibilities, on, both, sides, a, deep, calculation, is, more, difficult, and, may, not, be, practical, while, in, positions, with, a, limited, number, of, forced, variations, strong, players, can, calculate, long, sequences, of, moves, theoreticians, describe, many, elementary, tactical, methods, and, typical, maneuvers, for, example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered, attacks, especially, discovered, checks, zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and, interferences, simple, one, move, or, two, move, tactical, actions, threats, exchanges, of, material, and, double, attacks, can, be, combined, into, more, complicated, sequences, of, tactical, maneuvers, that, are, often, forced, from, the, point, of, view, of, one, or, both, players, a, forced, variation, that, involves, a, sacrifice, and, usually, results, in, a, tangible, gain, is, called, a, combination, brilliant, combinations, such, as, those, in, the, immortal, game, are, considered, beautiful, and, are, admired, by, chess, lovers, a, common, type, of, chess, exercise, aimed, at, developing, players, skills, is, a, position, where, a, decisive, combination, is, available, and, the, challenge, is, to, find, it, chess, strategy, is, concerned, with, the, evaluation, of, chess, positions, and, with, setting, up, goals, and, long, term, plans, for, future, play, during, the, evaluation, players, must, take, into, account, numerous, factors, such, as, the, value, of, the, pieces, on, the, board, control, of, the, center, and, centralization, the, pawn, structure, king, safety, and, the, control, of, key, squares, or, groups, of, squares, for, example, diagonals, open, files, and, dark, or, light, squares, the, most, basic, step, in, evaluating, a, position, is, to, count, the, total, value, of, pieces, of, both, sides, the, point, values, used, for, this, purpose, are, based, on, experience, usually, pawns, are, considered, worth, one, point, knights, and, bishops, about, three, points, each, rooks, about, five, points, the, value, difference, between, a, rook, and, a, bishop, or, knight, being, known, as, the, exchange, and, queens, about, nine, points, the, king, is, more, valuable, than, all, of, the, other, pieces, combined, since, its, checkmate, loses, the, game, but, in, practical, terms, in, the, endgame, the, king, as, a, fighting, piece, is, generally, more, powerful, than, a, bishop, or, knight, but, less, powerful, than, a, rook, these, basic, values, are, then, modified, by, other, factors, like, position, of, the, piece, e, g, advanced, pawns, are, usually, more, valuable, than, those, on, their, initial, squares, coordination, between, pieces, e, g, a, pair, of, bishops, usually, coordinate, better, than, a, bishop, and, a, knight, or, the, type, of, position, e, g, knights, are, generally, better, in, closed, positions, with, many, pawns, while, bishops, are, more, powerful, in, open, positions, another, important, factor, in, the, evaluation, of, chess, positions, is, pawn, structure, sometimes, known, as, the, pawn, skeleton, the, configuration, of, pawns, on, the, chessboard, since, pawns, are, the, least, mobile, of, the, pieces, pawn, structure, is, relatively, static, and, largely, determines, the, strategic, nature, of, the, position, weaknesses, in, pawn, structure, include, isolated, doubled, or, backward, pawns, and, holes, once, created, they, are, often, permanent, care, must, therefore, be, taken, to, avoid, these, weaknesses, unless, they, are, compensated, by, another, valuable, asset, for, example, by, the, possibility, of, developing, an, attack, the, endgame, also, end, game, or, ending, is, the, stage, of, the, game, when, there, are, few, pieces, left, on, the, board, there, are, three, main, strategic, differences, between, earlier, stages, of, the, game, and, the, endgame, endgames, can, be, classified, according, to, the, type, of, pieces, remaining, on, the, board, basic, checkmates, are, positions, in, which, one, side, has, only, a, king, and, the, other, side, has, one, or, two, pieces, and, can, checkmate, the, opposing, king, with, the, pieces, working, together, with, their, king, for, example, king, and, pawn, endgames, involve, only, kings, and, pawns, on, one, or, both, sides, and, the, task, of, the, stronger, side, is, to, promote, one, of, the, pawns, other, more, complicated, endings, are, classified, according, to, pieces, on, the, board, other, than, kings, such, as, rook, and, pawn, versus, rook, endgames, texts, referring, to, the, origins, of, chess, date, from, the, beginning, of, the, seventh, century, three, are, written, in, pahlavi, middle, persian, and, one, the, harshacharita, is, in, sanskrit, one, of, these, texts, the, chatrang, namak, represents, one, of, the, earliest, written, accounts, of, chess, the, narrator, bozorgmehr, explains, that, chatrang, chess, in, pahlavi, was, introduced, to, persia, by, dewasarm, a, great, ruler, of, india, during, the, reign, of, khosrow, i, dewasarm, has, fashioned, this, chatrang, after, the, likeness, of, a, battle, and, in, its, likeness, are, two, supreme, rulers, after, the, likeness, of, kings, shah, with, the, essentials, of, rooks, rukh, to, right, and, to, left, with, counsellor, farzin, in, the, likeness, of, a, commander, of, the, champions, with, the, elephant, pil, in, the, likeness, of, the, commander, of, the, rearguard, with, horse, asp, in, the, likeness, of, the, commander, of, the, cavalry, with, the, footsoldier, piyadak, in, the, likeness, of, so, many, infantry, in, the, vanguard, of, the, battle, the, oldest, known, chess, manual, was, in, arabic, and, dates, to, about, 840, written, by, al, adli, ar, rumi, 800, 870, a, renowned, arab, chess, player, titled, kitab, ash, shatranj, the, book, of, chess, this, is, a, lost, manuscript, but, is, referenced, in, later, works, here, also, al, adli, attributes, the, origins, of, persian, chess, to, india, along, with, the, eighth, century, collection, of, fables, kal, la, wa, dimna, by, the, 20th, century, a, substantial, consensus, developed, regarding, chess, s, origins, in, northwest, india, in, the, early, seventh, century, more, recently, this, consensus, has, been, the, subject, of, further, scrutiny, the, early, forms, of, chess, in, india, were, known, as, chatura, ga, sanskrit, literally, four, divisions, infantry, cavalry, elephants, and, chariotry, represented, by, pieces, that, would, later, evolve, into, the, modern, pawn, knight, bishop, and, rook, respectively, chaturanga, was, played, on, an, 8, 8, uncheckered, board, called, asht, pada, thence, it, spread, eastward, and, westward, along, the, silk, road, the, earliest, evidence, of, chess, is, found, in, nearby, sasanian, persia, around, 600, a, d, where, the, game, came, to, be, known, by, the, name, chatrang, persian, chatrang, was, taken, up, by, the, muslim, world, after, the, islamic, conquest, of, persia, 633, 51, where, it, was, then, named, shatranj, arabic, persian, with, the, pieces, largely, retaining, their, persian, names, in, spanish, shatranj, was, rendered, as, ajedrez, al, shatranj, in, portuguese, as, xadrez, and, in, greek, as, zatrikion, which, comes, directly, from, the, persian, chatrang, but, in, the, rest, of, europe, it, was, replaced, by, versions, of, the, persian, sh, h, king, from, which, the, english, words, check, and, chess, descend, the, word, checkmate, is, derived, from, the, persian, sh, h, m, t, the, king, is, dead, xiangqi, is, the, form, of, chess, best, known, in, china, the, eastern, migration, of, chess, into, china, and, southeast, asia, has, even, less, documentation, than, its, migration, west, making, it, largely, conjectured, the, word, xi, ngq, was, used, in, china, to, refer, to, a, game, from, 569, a, d, at, the, latest, but, it, has, not, been, proven, that, this, game, was, directly, related, to, chess, the, first, reference, to, chinese, chess, appears, in, a, book, entitled, xu, ngua, l, record, of, the, mysterious, and, strange, dating, to, about, 800, a, minority, view, holds, that, western, chess, arose, from, xi, ngq, or, one, of, its, predecessors, chess, historians, jean, louis, cazaux, and, rick, knowlton, contend, that, xiangqi, s, intrinsic, characteristics, make, it, easier, to, construct, an, evolutionary, path, from, china, to, india, persia, than, the, opposite, direction, the, oldest, archaeological, chess, artifacts, ivory, pieces, were, excavated, in, ancient, afrasiab, today, s, samarkand, in, uzbekistan, central, asia, and, date, to, about, 760, with, some, of, them, possibly, being, older, remarkably, almost, all, findings, of, the, oldest, pieces, come, from, along, the, silk, road, from, the, former, regions, of, the, tarim, basin, today, s, xinjiang, in, china, transoxiana, sogdiana, bactria, gandhara, to, iran, on, one, end, and, to, india, through, kashmir, on, the, other, the, game, reached, western, europe, and, russia, via, at, least, three, routes, the, earliest, being, in, the, ninth, century, by, the, year, 1000, it, had, spread, throughout, both, the, muslim, iberia, and, latin, europe, a, latin, poem, called, versus, de, scachis, verses, on, chess, dated, to, the, late, 10th, century, has, been, preserved, at, einsiedeln, abbey, in, switzerland, the, game, of, chess, was, then, played, and, known, in, all, european, countries, a, famous, 13th, century, spanish, manuscript, covering, chess, backgammon, and, dice, is, known, as, the, libro, de, los, juegos, which, is, the, earliest, european, treatise, on, chess, as, well, as, being, the, oldest, document, on, european, tables, games, the, rules, were, fundamentally, similar, to, those, of, the, arabic, shatranj, the, differences, were, mostly, in, the, use, of, a, checkered, board, instead, of, a, plain, monochrome, board, used, by, arabs, and, the, habit, of, allowing, some, or, all, pawns, to, make, an, initial, double, step, in, some, regions, the, queen, which, had, replaced, the, wazir, or, the, king, could, also, make, an, initial, two, square, leap, under, some, conditions, around, 1200, the, rules, of, shatranj, started, to, be, modified, in, europe, culminating, several, major, changes, later, in, the, emergence, of, modern, chess, practically, as, it, is, known, today, a, major, change, was, the, modern, piece, movement, rules, which, began, to, appear, in, intellectual, circles, in, valencia, spain, around, 1475, which, established, the, foundations, and, brought, it, very, close, to, current, chess, these, new, rules, then, were, quickly, adopted, in, italy, and, southern, france, before, diffusing, into, the, rest, of, europe, pawns, gained, the, ability, to, advance, two, squares, on, their, first, move, while, bishops, and, queens, acquired, their, modern, movement, powers, the, queen, replaced, the, earlier, vizier, chess, piece, toward, the, end, of, the, 10th, century, and, by, the, 15th, century, had, become, the, most, powerful, piece, in, light, of, that, modern, chess, was, often, referred, to, at, the, time, as, queen, s, chess, or, mad, queen, chess, castling, derived, from, the, king, s, leap, usually, in, combination, with, a, pawn, or, rook, move, to, bring, the, king, to, safety, was, introduced, these, new, rules, quickly, spread, throughout, western, europe, writings, about, chess, theory, began, to, appear, in, the, late, 15th, century, an, anonymous, treatise, on, chess, of, 1490, with, the, first, part, containing, some, openings, and, the, second, 30, endgames, is, deposited, in, the, library, of, the, university, of, g, ttingen, the, book, el, libro, dels, jochs, partitis, dels, schachs, en, nombre, de, 100, was, written, by, francesc, vicent, in, segorbe, in, 1495, but, no, copy, of, this, work, has, survived, the, repetici, n, de, amores, y, arte, de, ajedrez, repetition, of, love, and, the, art, of, playing, chess, by, spanish, churchman, luis, ram, rez, de, lucena, was, published, in, salamanca, in, 1497, lucena, and, later, masters, like, portuguese, pedro, damiano, italians, giovanni, leonardo, di, bona, giulio, cesare, polerio, and, gioachino, greco, and, spanish, bishop, ruy, l, pez, de, segura, developed, elements, of, opening, theory, and, started, to, analyze, simple, endgames, in, the, 18th, century, the, center, of, european, chess, life, moved, from, southern, europe, to, mainland, france, the, two, most, important, french, masters, were, fran, ois, andr, danican, philidor, a, musician, by, profession, who, discovered, the, importance, of, pawns, for, chess, strategy, and, later, louis, charles, mah, de, la, bourdonnais, who, won, a, famous, series, of, matches, against, irish, master, alexander, mcdonnell, in, 1834, centers, of, chess, activity, in, this, period, were, coffee, houses, in, major, european, cities, like, caf, de, la, r, gence, in, paris, and, simpson, s, divan, in, london, at, the, same, time, the, intellectual, movement, of, romanticism, had, had, a, far, reaching, impact, on, chess, with, aesthetics, and, tactical, beauty, being, held, in, higher, regard, than, objective, soundness, and, strategic, planning, as, a, result, virtually, all, games, began, with, the, open, game, and, it, was, considered, unsportsmanlike, to, decline, gambits, that, invited, tactical, play, such, as, the, king, s, gambit, and, the, evans, gambit, this, chess, philosophy, is, known, as, romantic, chess, and, a, sharp, tactical, style, consistent, with, the, principles, of, chess, romanticism, was, predominant, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, rules, concerning, stalemate, were, finalized, in, the, early, 19th, century, also, in, the, 19th, century, the, convention, that, white, moves, first, was, established, formerly, either, white, or, black, could, move, first, finally, the, rules, around, castling, and, en, passant, captures, were, standardized, variations, in, these, rules, persisted, in, italy, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, resulting, standard, game, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, western, chess, or, international, chess, particularly, in, asia, where, other, games, of, the, chess, family, such, as, xiangqi, are, prevalent, since, the, 19th, century, the, only, rule, changes, such, as, the, establishment, of, the, correct, procedure, for, claiming, a, draw, by, repetition, have, been, technical, in, nature, as, the, 19th, century, progressed, chess, organization, developed, quickly, many, chess, clubs, chess, books, and, chess, journals, appeared, there, were, correspondence, matches, between, cities, for, example, the, london, chess, club, played, against, the, edinburgh, chess, club, in, 1824, chess, problems, became, a, regular, part, of, 19th, century, newspapers, bernhard, horwitz, josef, kling, and, samuel, loyd, composed, some, of, the, most, influential, problems, in, 1843, von, der, lasa, published, his, and, bilguer, s, handbuch, des, schachspiels, handbook, of, chess, the, first, comprehensive, manual, of, chess, theory, the, first, modern, chess, tournament, was, organized, by, howard, staunton, a, leading, english, chess, player, and, was, held, in, london, in, 1851, it, was, won, by, the, german, adolf, anderssen, who, was, hailed, as, the, leading, chess, master, his, brilliant, energetic, attacking, style, was, typical, for, the, time, sparkling, games, like, anderssen, s, immortal, game, and, evergreen, game, or, morphy, s, opera, game, were, regarded, as, the, highest, possible, summit, of, the, art, of, chess, deeper, insight, into, the, nature, of, chess, came, with, the, american, paul, morphy, an, extraordinary, chess, prodigy, morphy, won, against, all, important, competitors, except, staunton, who, refused, to, play, including, anderssen, during, his, short, chess, career, between, 1857, and, 1863, morphy, s, success, stemmed, from, a, combination, of, brilliant, attacks, and, sound, strategy, he, intuitively, knew, how, to, prepare, attacks, prague, born, wilhelm, steinitz, laid, the, foundations, for, a, scientific, approach, to, the, game, the, art, of, breaking, a, position, down, into, components, and, preparing, correct, plans, in, addition, to, his, theoretical, achievements, steinitz, founded, an, important, tradition, his, triumph, over, the, leading, german, master, johannes, zukertort, in, 1886, is, regarded, as, the, first, official, world, chess, championship, this, win, marked, a, stylistic, transition, at, the, highest, levels, of, chess, from, an, attacking, tactical, style, predominant, in, the, romantic, era, to, a, more, positional, strategic, style, introduced, to, the, chess, world, by, steinitz, steinitz, lost, his, crown, in, 1894, to, a, much, younger, player, the, german, mathematician, emanuel, lasker, who, maintained, this, title, for, 27, years, the, longest, tenure, of, any, world, champion, after, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, number, of, master, tournaments, and, matches, held, annually, quickly, grew, the, first, olympiad, was, held, in, paris, in, 1924, and, fide, was, founded, initially, for, the, purpose, of, organizing, that, event, in, 1927, the, women, s, world, chess, championship, was, established, the, first, to, hold, the, title, was, czech, english, master, vera, menchik, a, prodigy, from, cuba, jos, ra, l, capablanca, known, for, his, skill, in, endgames, won, the, world, championship, from, lasker, in, 1921, capablanca, was, undefeated, in, tournament, play, for, eight, years, from, 1916, to, 1924, his, successor, 1927, was, the, russian, french, alexander, alekhine, a, strong, attacking, player, who, died, as, the, world, champion, in, 1946, alekhine, briefly, lost, the, title, to, dutch, player, max, euwe, in, 1935, and, regained, it, two, years, later, in, the, interwar, period, chess, was, revolutionized, by, the, new, theoretical, school, of, so, called, hypermodernists, like, aron, nimzowitsch, and, richard, r, ti, they, advocated, controlling, the, center, of, the, board, with, distant, pieces, rather, than, with, pawns, thus, inviting, opponents, to, occupy, the, center, with, pawns, which, become, objects, of, attack, after, the, death, of, alekhine, a, new, world, champion, was, sought, fide, which, has, controlled, the, title, since, then, ran, a, tournament, of, elite, players, the, winner, of, the, 1948, tournament, was, russian, mikhail, botvinnik, in, 1950, fide, established, a, system, of, titles, conferring, the, title, of, grandmaster, on, 27, players, some, sources, state, that, in, 1914, the, title, of, chess, grandmaster, was, first, formally, conferred, by, tsar, nicholas, ii, of, russia, to, lasker, capablanca, alekhine, tarrasch, and, marshall, but, this, is, a, disputed, claim, botvinnik, started, an, era, of, soviet, dominance, in, the, chess, world, which, mainly, through, the, soviet, government, s, politically, inspired, efforts, to, demonstrate, intellectual, superiority, over, the, west, stood, almost, uninterrupted, for, more, than, a, half, century, until, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, there, was, only, one, non, soviet, champion, american, bobby, fischer, champion, 1972, 1975, botvinnik, also, revolutionized, opening, theory, previously, black, strove, for, equality, attempting, to, neutralize, white, s, first, move, advantage, as, black, botvinnik, strove, for, the, initiative, from, the, beginning, in, the, previous, informal, system, of, world, championships, the, current, champion, decided, which, challenger, he, would, play, for, the, title, and, the, challenger, was, forced, to, seek, sponsors, for, the, match, fide, set, up, a, new, system, of, qualifying, tournaments, and, matches, the, world, s, strongest, players, were, seeded, into, interzonal, tournaments, where, they, were, joined, by, players, who, had, qualified, from, zonal, tournaments, the, leading, finishers, in, these, interzonals, would, go, through, the, candidates, stage, which, was, initially, a, tournament, and, later, a, series, of, knockout, matches, the, winner, of, the, candidates, would, then, play, the, reigning, champion, for, the, title, a, champion, defeated, in, a, match, had, a, right, to, play, a, rematch, a, year, later, this, system, operated, on, a, three, year, cycle, botvinnik, participated, in, championship, matches, over, a, period, of, fifteen, years, he, won, the, world, championship, tournament, in, 1948, and, retained, the, title, in, tied, matches, in, 1951, and, 1954, in, 1957, he, lost, to, vasily, smyslov, but, regained, the, title, in, a, rematch, in, 1958, in, 1960, he, lost, the, title, to, the, 23, year, old, latvian, prodigy, mikhail, tal, an, accomplished, tactician, and, attacking, player, who, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, creative, players, ever, hence, his, nickname, the, magician, from, riga, botvinnik, again, regained, the, title, in, a, rematch, in, 1961, following, the, 1961, event, fide, abolished, the, automatic, right, of, a, deposed, champion, to, a, rematch, and, the, next, champion, armenian, tigran, petrosian, a, player, renowned, for, his, defensive, and, positional, skills, held, the, title, for, two, cycles, 1963, 1969, his, successor, boris, spassky, from, russia, champion, 1969, 1972, won, games, in, both, positional, and, sharp, tactical, style, the, next, championship, the, so, called, match, of, the, century, saw, the, first, non, soviet, challenger, since, world, war, ii, american, bobby, fischer, fischer, defeated, his, opponents, in, the, candidates, matches, by, unheard, of, margins, and, convincingly, defeated, spassky, for, the, world, championship, the, match, was, followed, closely, by, news, media, of, the, day, leading, to, a, surge, in, popularity, for, chess, it, also, held, significant, political, importance, at, the, height, of, the, cold, war, with, the, match, being, seen, by, both, sides, as, a, microcosm, of, the, conflict, between, east, and, west, in, 1975, however, fischer, refused, to, defend, his, title, against, soviet, anatoly, karpov, when, he, was, unable, to, reach, agreement, on, conditions, with, fide, and, karpov, obtained, the, title, by, default, fischer, modernized, many, aspects, of, chess, especially, by, extensively, preparing, openings, karpov, defended, his, title, twice, against, viktor, korchnoi, and, dominated, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, with, a, string, of, tournament, successes, in, the, 1984, world, chess, championship, karpov, faced, his, toughest, challenge, to, date, the, young, garry, kasparov, from, baku, soviet, azerbaijan, the, match, was, aborted, in, controversial, circumstances, after, 5, months, and, 48, games, with, karpov, leading, by, 5, wins, to, 3, but, evidently, exhausted, many, commentators, believed, kasparov, who, had, won, the, last, two, games, would, have, won, the, match, had, it, continued, kasparov, won, the, 1985, rematch, kasparov, and, karpov, contested, three, further, closely, fought, matches, in, 1986, 1987, and, 1990, kasparov, winning, them, all, kasparov, became, the, dominant, figure, of, world, chess, from, the, mid, 1980s, until, his, retirement, from, competition, in, 2005, chess, playing, computer, programs, later, known, as, chess, engines, began, to, appear, in, the, 1960s, in, 1970, the, first, major, computer, chess, tournament, the, north, american, computer, chess, championship, was, held, followed, in, 1974, by, the, first, world, computer, chess, championship, in, the, late, 1970s, dedicated, home, chess, computers, such, as, fidelity, electronics, chess, challenger, became, commercially, available, as, well, as, software, to, run, on, home, computers, the, overall, standard, of, computer, chess, was, low, however, until, the, 1990s, the, first, endgame, tablebases, which, provided, perfect, play, for, relatively, simple, endgames, such, as, king, and, rook, versus, king, and, bishop, appeared, in, the, late, 1970s, this, set, a, precedent, to, the, complete, six, and, seven, piece, tablebases, that, became, available, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, respectively, the, first, commercial, chess, database, a, collection, of, chess, games, searchable, by, move, and, position, was, introduced, by, the, german, company, chessbase, in, 1987, databases, containing, millions, of, chess, games, have, since, had, a, profound, effect, on, opening, theory, and, other, areas, of, chess, research, digital, chess, clocks, were, invented, in, 1973, though, they, did, not, become, commonplace, until, the, 1990s, digital, clocks, allow, for, time, controls, involving, increments, and, delays, the, internet, enabled, online, chess, as, a, new, medium, of, playing, with, chess, servers, allowing, users, to, play, other, people, from, different, parts, of, the, world, in, real, time, the, first, such, server, known, as, internet, chess, server, or, ics, was, developed, at, the, university, of, utah, in, 1992, ics, formed, the, basis, for, the, first, commercial, chess, server, the, internet, chess, club, which, was, launched, in, 1995, and, for, other, early, chess, servers, such, as, fics, free, internet, chess, server, since, then, many, other, platforms, have, appeared, and, online, chess, began, to, rival, over, the, board, chess, in, popularity, during, the, 2020, covid, 19, pandemic, the, isolation, ensuing, from, quarantines, imposed, in, many, places, around, the, world, combined, with, the, success, of, the, popular, netflix, show, the, queen, s, gambit, and, other, factors, such, as, the, popularity, of, online, tournaments, notably, pogchamps, and, chess, twitch, streamers, resulted, in, a, surge, of, popularity, not, only, for, online, chess, but, for, the, game, of, chess, in, general, this, phenomenon, has, been, referred, to, in, the, media, as, the, 2020, online, chess, boom, computer, chess, has, also, seen, major, advances, by, the, 1990s, chess, engines, could, consistently, defeat, most, amateurs, and, in, 1997, deep, blue, defeated, world, champion, garry, kasparov, in, a, six, game, match, starting, an, era, of, computer, dominance, at, the, highest, level, of, chess, in, the, 2010s, engines, significantly, stronger, than, even, the, best, human, players, became, accessible, for, free, on, a, number, of, pc, and, mobile, platforms, and, free, engine, analysis, became, a, commonplace, feature, on, internet, chess, servers, an, adverse, effect, of, the, easy, availability, of, engine, analysis, on, hand, held, devices, and, personal, computers, has, been, the, rise, of, computer, cheating, which, has, grown, to, be, a, major, concern, in, both, over, the, board, and, online, chess, in, 2017, alphazero, a, neural, network, also, capable, of, playing, shogi, and, go, was, introduced, since, then, many, chess, engines, based, on, neural, network, evaluation, have, been, written, the, best, of, which, have, surpassed, the, traditional, brute, force, engines, alphazero, also, introduced, many, novel, ideas, and, ways, of, playing, the, game, which, affected, the, style, of, play, at, the, top, level, as, endgame, tablebases, developed, they, began, to, provide, perfect, play, in, endgame, positions, in, which, the, game, theoretical, outcome, was, previously, unknown, such, as, positions, with, king, queen, and, pawn, against, king, and, queen, in, 1991, lewis, stiller, published, a, tablebase, for, select, six, piece, endgames, and, by, 2005, following, the, publication, of, nalimov, tablebases, all, six, piece, endgame, positions, were, solved, in, 2012, lomonosov, tablebases, were, published, which, solved, all, seven, piece, endgame, positions, use, of, tablebases, enhances, the, performance, of, chess, engines, by, providing, definitive, results, in, some, branches, of, analysis, technological, progress, made, in, the, 1990s, and, the, 21st, century, has, influenced, the, way, that, chess, is, studied, at, all, levels, as, well, as, the, state, of, chess, as, a, spectator, sport, previously, preparation, at, the, professional, level, required, an, extensive, chess, library, and, several, subscriptions, to, publications, such, as, chess, informant, to, keep, up, with, opening, developments, and, study, opponents, games, today, preparation, at, the, professional, level, involves, the, use, of, databases, containing, millions, of, games, and, engines, to, analyze, different, opening, variations, and, prepare, novelties, a, number, of, online, learning, resources, are, also, available, for, players, of, all, levels, such, as, online, courses, tactics, trainers, and, video, lessons, since, the, late, 1990s, it, has, been, possible, to, follow, major, international, chess, events, online, the, players, moves, being, relayed, in, real, time, sensory, boards, have, been, developed, to, enable, automatic, transmission, of, moves, chess, players, will, frequently, run, engines, while, watching, these, games, allowing, them, to, quickly, identify, mistakes, by, the, players, and, spot, tactical, opportunities, while, in, the, past, the, moves, have, been, relayed, live, today, chess, organizers, will, often, impose, a, half, hour, delay, as, an, anti, cheating, measure, in, the, mid, to, late, 2010s, and, especially, following, the, 2020, online, boom, it, became, commonplace, for, supergrandmasters, such, as, hikaru, nakamura, and, magnus, carlsen, to, livestream, chess, content, on, platforms, such, as, twitch, also, following, the, boom, online, chess, started, being, viewed, as, an, esport, with, esport, teams, signing, chess, players, for, the, first, time, in, 2020, organized, chess, even, for, young, children, has, become, common, fide, holds, world, championships, for, age, levels, down, to, 8, years, old, the, largest, tournaments, in, number, of, players, are, those, held, for, children, the, number, of, grandmasters, and, other, chess, professionals, has, also, grown, in, the, modern, era, kenneth, regan, and, guy, haworth, conducted, research, involving, comparison, of, move, choices, by, players, of, different, levels, and, from, different, periods, with, the, analysis, of, strong, chess, engines, they, concluded, that, the, increase, in, the, number, of, grandmasters, and, higher, elo, ratings, of, the, top, players, reflect, an, actual, increase, in, the, average, standard, of, play, rather, than, rating, inflation, or, title, inflation, in, 1993, garry, kasparov, and, nigel, short, broke, ties, with, fide, to, organize, their, own, match, for, the, world, championship, and, formed, a, competing, professional, chess, association, pca, from, then, until, 2006, there, were, two, simultaneous, world, championships, and, respective, world, champions, the, pca, or, classical, champions, extending, the, steinitzian, tradition, in, which, the, current, champion, plays, a, challenger, in, a, series, of, games, and, the, other, following, fide, s, new, format, of, many, players, competing, in, a, large, knockout, tournament, to, determine, the, champion, kasparov, lost, his, pca, title, in, 2000, to, vladimir, kramnik, of, russia, due, to, the, complicated, state, of, world, chess, politics, and, difficulties, obtaining, commercial, sponsorships, kasparov, was, never, able, to, challenge, for, the, title, again, despite, this, he, continued, to, dominate, in, top, level, tournaments, and, remained, the, world, s, highest, rated, player, until, his, retirement, from, competitive, chess, in, 2005, the, world, chess, championship, 2006, in, which, kramnik, beat, the, fide, world, champion, veselin, topalov, reunified, the, titles, and, made, kramnik, the, undisputed, world, chess, champion, in, september, 2007, he, lost, the, title, to, viswanathan, anand, of, india, who, won, the, championship, tournament, in, mexico, city, anand, defended, his, title, in, the, revenge, match, of, 2008, 2010, and, 2012, magnus, carlsen, defeated, anand, in, the, 2013, world, chess, championship, and, defended, his, title, in, 2014, 2016, 2018, and, 2021, after, the, 2021, match, he, announced, that, he, would, not, defend, his, title, a, fifth, time, so, the, 2023, world, chess, championship, was, played, between, the, winner, and, runner, up, of, the, candidates, tournament, 2022, respectively, ian,

sets, used, by, the, aristocracy, at, least, partially, survive, such, as, the, lewis, chessmen, chess, was, often, used, as, a, basis, of, sermons, on, morality, an, example, is, liber, de, moribus, hominum, et, officiis, nobilium, sive, super, ludo, scacchorum, book, of, the, customs, of, men, and, the, duties, of, nobles, or, the, book, of, chess, written, by, an, italian, dominican, friar, jacobus, de, cessolis, c, 1300, this, book, was, one, of, the, most, popular, of, the, middle, ages, the, work, was, translated, into, many, other, languages, the, first, printed, edition, was, published, at, utrecht, in, 1473, and, was, the, basis, for, william, caxton, s, the, game, and, playe, of, the, chesse, 1474, one, of, the, first, books, printed, in, english, different, chess,

which, starts, with, the, names, of, chess, pieces, roch, pedites, regina, the, game, of, chess, at, times, has, been, discouraged, by, various, religious, authorities, in, middle, ages, jewish, catholic, and, orthodox, some, muslim, authorities, prohibited, it, even, recently, for, example, ruhollah, khomeini, in, 1979, and, abdul, aziz, ash, sheikh, even, later, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, chess, was, viewed, as, a, means, of, self, improvement, benjamin, franklin, in, his, article, the, morals, of, chess, 1750, wrote, the, game, of, chess, is, not, merely, an, idle, amusement, several, very, valuable, qualities, of, the, mind, useful, in, the, course, of, human, life, are, to, be, acquired, and, strengthened, by, it, so, as, to, become, habits, ready, on, all, occasions, for, life, is, a, kind, of, chess, in, which, we, have, often, points, to, gain, and, competitors, or, adversaries, to, contend, with, and, in, which, there, is, a, vast, variety, of, good, and, ill, events, that, are, in, some, degree, the, effect, of, prudence, or, the, want, of, it, by, playing, at, chess, then, we, may, learn, i, foresight, which, looks, a, little, into, futurity, and, considers, the, consequences, that, may, attend, an, action, ii, circumspection, which, surveys, the, whole, chess, board, or, scene, of, action, the, relation, of, the, several, pieces, and, their, situations, iii, caution, not, to, make, our, moves, too, hastily, chess, was, occasionally, criticized, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, waste, of, time, chess, is, taught, to, children, in, schools, around, the, world, today, many, schools, host, chess, clubs, and, there, are, many, scholastic, tournaments, specifically, for, children, tournaments, are, held, regularly, in, many, countries, hosted, by, organizations, such, as, the, united, states, chess, federation, and, the, national, scholastic, chess, foundation, chess, is, many, times, depicted, in, the, arts, significant, works, where, chess, plays, a, key, role, range, from, thomas, middleton, s, a, game, at, chess, to, through, the, looking, glass, by, lewis, carroll, to, vladimir, nabokov, s, the, defense, to, the, royal, game, by, stefan, zweig, chess, has, also, featured, in, film, classics, such, as, ingmar, bergman, s, the, seventh, seal, satyajit, ray, s, the, chess, players, and, powell, and, pressburger, s, a, matter, of, life, and, death, chess, is, also, present, in, contemporary, popular, culture, for, example, the, characters, in, star, trek, play, a, futuristic, version, of, the, game, called, federation, tri, dimensional, chess, and, wizard, s, chess, is, played, in, j, k, rowling, s, harry, potter, the, game, structure, and, nature, of, chess, are, related, to, several, branches, of, mathematics, many, combinatorical, and, topological, problems, connected, to, chess, such, as, the, knight, s, tour, and, the, eight, queens, puzzle, have, been, known, for, hundreds, of, years, the, number, of, legal, positions, in, chess, is, estimated, to, be, 4, 59, 0, 38, 10, 44, with, a, 95, confidence, level, with, a, game, tree, complexity, of, approximately, 10, 123, the, game, tree, complexity, of, chess, was, first, calculated, by, claude, shannon, as, 10, 120, a, number, known, as, the, shannon, number, an, average, position, typically, has, thirty, to, forty, possible, moves, but, there, may, be, as, few, as, zero, in, the, case, of, checkmate, or, stalemate, or, in, a, constructed, position, as, many, as, 218, in, 1913, ernst, zermelo, used, chess, as, a, basis, for, his, theory, of, game, strategies, which, is, considered, one, of, the, predecessors, of, game, theory, zermelo, s, theorem, states, that, it, is, possible, to, solve, chess, i, e, to, determine, with, certainty, the, outcome, of, a, perfectly, played, game, either, white, can, force, a, win, or, black, can, force, a, win, or, both, sides, can, force, at, least, a, draw, with, 10, 43, legal, positions, in, chess, however, it, will, take, an, impossibly, long, time, to, compute, a, perfect, strategy, with, any, feasible, technology, there, is, an, extensive, scientific, literature, on, chess, psychology, alfred, binet, and, others, showed, that, knowledge, and, verbal, rather, than, visuospatial, ability, lies, at, the, core, of, expertise, in, his, doctoral, thesis, adriaan, de, groot, showed, that, chess, masters, can, rapidly, perceive, the, key, features, of, a, position, according, to, de, groot, this, perception, made, possible, by, years, of, practice, and, study, is, more, important, than, the, sheer, ability, to, anticipate, moves, de, groot, showed, that, chess, masters, can, memorize, positions, shown, for, a, few, seconds, almost, perfectly, the, ability, to, memorize, does, not, alone, account, for, chess, playing, skill, since, masters, and, novices, when, faced, with, random, arrangements, of, chess, pieces, had, equivalent, recall, about, six, positions, in, each, case, rather, it, is, the, ability, to, recognize, patterns, which, are, then, memorized, which, distinguished, the, skilled, players, from, the, novices, when, the, positions, of, the, pieces, were, taken, from, an, actual, game, the, masters, had, almost, total, positional, recall, more, recent, research, has, focused, on, chess, as, mental, training, the, respective, roles, of, knowledge, and, look, ahead, search, brain, imaging, studies, of, chess, masters, and, novices, blindfold, chess, the, role, of, personality, and, intelligence, in, chess, skill, gender, differences, and, computational, models, of, chess, expertise, the, role, of, practice, and, talent, in, the, development, of, chess, and, other, domains, of, expertise, has, led, to, much, empirical, investigation, ericsson, and, colleagues, have, argued, that, deliberate, practice, is, sufficient, for, reaching, high, levels, of, expertise, in, chess, recent, research, however, fails, to, replicate, their, results, and, indicates, that, factors, other, than, practice, are, also, important, for, example, fernand, gobet, and, colleagues, have, shown, that, stronger, players, started, playing, chess, at, a, young, age, and, that, experts, born, in, the, northern, hemisphere, are, more, likely, to, have, been, born, in, late, winter, and, early, spring, compared, to, the, general, population, chess, players, are, more, likely, to, be, non, right, handed, though, they, found, no, correlation, between, handedness, and, skill, a, relationship, between, chess, skill, and, intelligence, has, long, been, discussed, in, scientific, literature, as, well, as, in, popular, culture, academic, studies, that, investigate, the, relationship, date, back, at, least, to, 1927, although, one, meta, analysis, and, most, children, studies, find, a, positive, correlation, between, general, cognitive, ability, and, chess, skill, adult, studies, show, mixed, results, chess, composition, is, the, art, of, creating, chess, problems, also, called, chess, compositions, the, creator, is, known, as, a, chess, composer, there, are, many, types, of, chess, problems, the, two, most, important, are, fairy, chess, is, a, branch, of, chess, problem, composition, involving, altered, rules, such, as, the, use, of, unconventional, pieces, or, boards, or, unusual, stipulations, such, as, reflexmates, tournaments, for, composition, and, solving, of, chess, problems, are, organized, by, the, world, federation, for, chess, composition, which, works, cooperatively, with, but, independent, of, fide, the, wfcc, awards, titles, for, composing, and, solving, chess, problems, online, chess, is, chess, that, is, played, over, the, internet, allowing, players, to, play, against, each, other, in, real, time, this, is, done, through, the, use, of, internet, chess, servers, which, pair, up, individual, players, based, on, their, rating, using, an, elo, or, similar, rating, system, online, chess, saw, a, spike, in, growth, during, the, quarantines, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, this, can, be, attributed, to, both, isolation, and, the, popularity, of, netflix, miniseries, the, queen, s, gambit, which, was, released, in, october, 2020, chess, app, downloads, on, the, app, store, and, google, play, store, rose, by, 63, after, the, show, debuted, chess, com, saw, more, than, twice, as, many, account, registrations, in, november, as, it, had, in, previous, months, and, the, number, of, games, played, monthly, on, lichess, doubled, as, well, there, was, also, a, demographic, shift, in, players, with, female, registration, on, chess, com, shifting, from, 22, to, 27, of, new, players, gm, maurice, ashley, said, a, boom, is, taking, place, in, chess, like, we, have, never, seen, maybe, since, the, bobby, fischer, days, attributing, the, growth, to, an, increased, desire, to, do, something, constructive, during, the, pandemic, uscf, women, s, program, director, jennifer, shahade, stated, that, chess, works, well, on, the, internet, since, pieces, do, not, need, to, be, reset, and, matchmaking, is, virtually, instant, the, idea, of, creating, a, chess, playing, machine, dates, to, the, 18th, century, around, 1769, the, chess, playing, automaton, called, the, turk, became, famous, before, being, exposed, as, a, hoax, serious, trials, based, on, automata, such, as, el, ajedrecista, were, too, complex, and, limited, to, be, useful, since, the, advent, of, the, digital, computer, in, the, 1950s, chess, enthusiasts, computer, engineers, and, computer, scientists, have, built, with, increasing, degrees, of, seriousness, and, success, chess, playing, machines, and, computer, programs, the, groundbreaking, paper, on, computer, chess, programming, a, computer, for, playing, chess, was, published, in, 1950, by, claude, shannon, he, wrote, the, chess, machine, is, an, ideal, one, to, start, with, since, 1, the, problem, is, sharply, defined, both, in, allowed, operations, the, moves, and, in, the, ultimate, goal, checkmate, 2, it, is, neither, so, simple, as, to, be, trivial, nor, too, difficult, for, satisfactory, solution, 3, chess, is, generally, considered, to, require, thinking, for, skillful, play, a, solution, of, this, problem, will, force, us, either, to, admit, the, possibility, of, a, mechanized, thinking, or, to, further, restrict, our, concept, of, thinking, 4, the, discrete, structure, of, chess, fits, well, into, the, digital, nature, of, modern, computers, the, association, for, computing, machinery, acm, held, the, first, major, chess, tournament, for, computers, the, north, american, computer, chess, championship, in, september, 1970, chess, 3, 0, a, chess, program, from, northwestern, university, won, the, championship, the, first, world, computer, chess, championship, held, in, 1974, was, won, by, the, soviet, program, kaissa, at, first, considered, only, a, curiosity, the, best, chess,

deep, blue, beat, garry, kasparov, 3, 2, it, scored, two, wins, one, loss, and, three, draws, there, was, some, controversy, over, the, match, and, human, computer, matches, were, relatively, close, over, the, next, few, years, until, convincing, computer, victories, in, 2005, and, in, 2006, in, 2009, a, mobile, phone, won, a, category, 6, tournament, with, a, performance, rating, of, 2898, chess, engine, hiarcs, 13, running, on, the, mobile, phone, htc, touch, hd, won, the, copa, mercosur, tournament, with, nine, wins, and, one, draw, the, best, chess, programs, are, now, able, to, consistently, beat, the, strongest, human, players, to, the, extent, that, human, computer, matches, no, longer, attract, interest, from, chess, players, or, the, media, while, the, world, computer, chess, championship, still, exists, the, top, chess, engine, championship, tcec, is, widely, regarded, as, the, unofficial, world, championship, for, chess, engines, the, current, champion, is,

to, find, and, play, opponents, worldwide, the, presence, of, computers, and, modern, communication, tools, have, raised, concerns, regarding, cheating, during, games, there, are, more, than, two, thousand, published, chess, variants, games, with, similar, but, different, rules, most, of, them, are, of, relatively, recent, origin, they, include, in, the, context, of, chess, variants, chess, is,
