underwater, diving, as, a, human, activity, is, the, practice, of, descending, below, the, water, s, surface, to, interact, with, the, environment, it, is, also, often, referred, to, as, diving, an, ambiguous, term, with, several, possible, meanings, depending, on, context, immersion, in, water, and, exposure, to, high, ambient, pressure, have, physiological, effects, that, limit, the, depths, and, duration, possible, in, ambient, pressure, diving, humans, are, not, physiologically, and, anatomically, well, adapted, to, the, environmental, conditions, of, diving, and, various, equipment, has, been, developed, to, extend, the, depth, and, duration, of, human, dives, and, allow, different, types, of, work, to, be, done, in, ambient, pressure, diving, the, diver, is, directly, exposed, to, the, pressure, of, the, surrounding, water, the, ambient, pressure, diver, may, dive, on, breath, hold, freediving, or, use, breathing, apparatus, for, scuba, diving, or, surface, supplied, diving, and, the, saturation, diving, technique, reduces, the, risk, of, decompression, sickness, dcs, after, long, duration, deep, dives, atmospheric, diving, suits, ads, may, be, used, to, isolate, the, diver, from, high, ambient, pressure, crewed, submersibles, can, extend, depth, range, to, full, ocean, depth, and, remotely, controlled, or, robotic, machines, can, reduce, risk, to, humans, the, environment, exposes, the, diver, to, a, wide, range, of, hazards, and, though, the, risks, are, largely, controlled, by, appropriate, diving, skills, training, types, of, equipment, and, breathing, gases, used, depending, on, the, mode, depth, and, purpose, of, diving, it, remains, a, relatively, dangerous, activity, professional, diving, is, usually, regulated, by, occupational, health, and, safety, legislation, while, recreational, diving, may, be, entirely, unregulated, diving, activities, are, restricted, to, maximum, depths, of, about, 40, metres, 130, ft, for, recreational, scuba, diving, 530, metres, 1, 740, ft, for, commercial, saturation, diving, and, 610, metres, 2, 000, ft, wearing, atmospheric, suits, diving, is, also, restricted, to, conditions, which, are, not, excessively, hazardous, though, the, level, of, risk, acceptable, can, vary, and, fatal, incidents, may, occur, recreational, diving, sometimes, called, sport, diving, or, subaquatics, is, a, popular, leisure, activity, technical, diving, is, a, form, of, recreational, diving, under, more, challenging, conditions, professional, diving, commercial, diving, diving, for, research, purposes, or, for, financial, gain, involves, working, underwater, public, safety, diving, is, the, underwater, work, done, by, law, enforcement, fire, rescue, and, underwater, search, and, recovery, dive, teams, military, diving, includes, combat, diving, clearance, diving, and, ships, husbandry, deep, sea, diving, is, underwater, diving, usually, with, surface, supplied, equipment, and, often, refers, to, the, use, of, standard, diving, dress, with, the, traditional, copper, helmet, hard, hat, diving, is, any, form, of, diving, with, a, helmet, including, the, standard, copper, helmet, and, other, forms, of, free, flow, and, lightweight, demand, helmets, the, history, of, breath, hold, diving, goes, back, at, least, to, classical, times, and, there, is, evidence, of, prehistoric, hunting, and, gathering, of, seafoods, that, may, have, involved, underwater, swimming, technical, advances, allowing, the, provision, of, breathing, gas, to, a, diver, underwater, at, ambient, pressure, are, recent, and, self, contained, breathing, systems, developed, at, an, accelerated, rate, following, the, second, world, war, immersion, in, water, and, exposure, to, cold, water, and, high, pressure, have, physiological, effects, on, the, diver, which, limit, the, depths, and, duration, possible, in, ambient, pressure, diving, breath, hold, endurance, is, a, severe, limitation, and, breathing, at, high, ambient, pressure, adds, further, complications, both, directly, and, indirectly, technological, solutions, have, been, developed, which, can, greatly, extend, depth, and, duration, of, human, ambient, pressure, dives, and, allow, useful, work, to, be, done, underwater, immersion, of, the, human, body, in, water, affects, the, circulation, renal, system, fluid, balance, and, breathing, because, the, external, hydrostatic, pressure, of, the, water, provides, support, against, the, internal, hydrostatic, pressure, of, the, blood, this, causes, a, blood, shift, from, the, extravascular, tissues, of, the, limbs, into, the, chest, cavity, and, fluid, losses, known, as, immersion, diuresis, compensate, for, the, blood, shift, in, hydrated, subjects, soon, after, immersion, hydrostatic, pressure, on, the, body, from, head, out, immersion, causes, negative, pressure, breathing, which, contributes, to, the, blood, shift, the, blood, shift, causes, an, increased, respiratory, and, cardiac, workload, stroke, volume, is, not, greatly, affected, by, immersion, or, variation, in, ambient, pressure, but, slowed, heartbeat, reduces, the, overall, cardiac, output, particularly, because, of, the, diving, reflex, in, breath, hold, diving, lung, volume, decreases, in, the, upright, position, owing, to, cranial, displacement, of, the, abdomen, from, hydrostatic, pressure, and, resistance, to, air, flow, in, the, airways, increases, because, of, the, decrease, in, lung, volume, there, appears, to, be, a, connection, between, pulmonary, edema, and, increased, pulmonary, blood, flow, and, pressure, which, results, in, capillary, engorgement, this, may, occur, during, higher, intensity, exercise, while, immersed, or, submerged, the, diving, reflex, is, a, response, to, immersion, that, overrides, the, basic, homeostatic, reflexes, it, optimises, respiration, by, preferentially, distributing, oxygen, stores, to, the, heart, and, brain, which, allows, extended, periods, underwater, it, is, exhibited, strongly, in, aquatic, mammals, seals, otters, dolphins, and, muskrats, and, also, exists, in, other, mammals, including, humans, diving, birds, such, as, penguins, have, a, similar, diving, reflex, the, diving, reflex, is, triggered, by, chilling, the, face, and, holding, the, breath, the, cardiovascular, system, constricts, peripheral, blood, vessels, slows, the, pulse, rate, redirects, blood, to, the, vital, organs, to, conserve, oxygen, releases, red, blood, cells, stored, in, the, spleen, and, in, humans, causes, heart, rhythm, irregularities, aquatic, mammals, have, evolved, physiological, adaptations, to, conserve, oxygen, during, submersion, but, apnea, slowed, pulse, rate, and, vasoconstriction, are, shared, with, terrestrial, mammals, cold, shock, response, is, the, physiological, response, of, organisms, to, sudden, cold, especially, cold, water, and, is, a, common, cause, of, death, from, immersion, in, very, cold, water, such, as, by, falling, through, thin, ice, the, immediate, shock, of, the, cold, causes, involuntary, inhalation, which, if, underwater, can, result, in, drowning, the, cold, water, can, also, cause, heart, attack, due, to, vasoconstriction, the, heart, has, to, work, harder, to, pump, the, same, volume, of, blood, throughout, the, body, and, for, people, with, heart, disease, this, additional, workload, can, cause, the, heart, to, go, into, arrest, a, person, who, survives, the, initial, minute, after, falling, into, cold, water, can, survive, for, at, least, thirty, minutes, provided, they, do, not, drown, the, ability, to, stay, afloat, declines, substantially, after, about, ten, minutes, as, the, chilled, muscles, lose, strength, and, co, ordination, hypothermia, is, reduced, core, body, temperature, that, occurs, when, a, body, loses, more, heat, than, it, generates, it, is, a, major, limitation, to, swimming, or, diving, in, cold, water, the, reduction, in, finger, dexterity, due, to, pain, or, numbness, decreases, general, safety, and, work, capacity, which, in, turn, increases, the, risk, of, other, injuries, non, freezing, cold, injury, can, affect, the, extremities, in, cold, water, diving, and, frostbite, can, occur, when, air, temperatures, are, low, enough, to, cause, tissue, freezing, body, heat, is, lost, much, more, quickly, in, water, than, in, air, so, water, temperatures, that, would, be, tolerable, as, outdoor, air, temperatures, can, lead, to, hypothermia, which, may, lead, to, death, from, other, causes, in, inadequately, protected, divers, thermoregulation, of, divers, is, complicated, by, breathing, gases, at, raised, ambient, pressure, and, by, gas, mixtures, necessary, for, limiting, inert, gas, narcosis, work, of, breathing, and, for, accelerating, decompression, breath, hold, diving, by, an, air, breathing, animal, is, limited, to, the, physiological, capacity, to, perform, the, dive, on, the, oxygen, available, until, it, returns, to, a, source, of, fresh, breathing, gas, usually, the, air, at, the, surface, as, this, internal, oxygen, supply, reduces, the, animal, experiences, an, increasing, urge, to, breathe, caused, by, buildup, of, carbon, dioxide, and, lactate, in, the, blood, followed, by, loss, of, consciousness, due, to, cerebral, hypoxia, if, this, occurs, underwater, it, will, drown, blackouts, in, freediving, can, occur, when, the, breath, is, held, long, enough, for, metabolic, activity, to, reduce, the, oxygen, partial, pressure, sufficiently, to, cause, loss, of, consciousness, this, is, accelerated, by, exertion, which, uses, oxygen, faster, and, can, be, exacerbated, by, hyperventilation, directly, before, the, dive, which, reduces, the, carbon, dioxide, level, in, the, blood, lower, carbon, dioxide, levels, increase, the, oxygen, haemoglobin, affinity, reducing, availability, of, oxygen, to, brain, tissue, towards, the, end, of, the, dive, bohr, effect, they, also, suppress, the, urge, to, breathe, making, it, easier, to, hold, the, breath, to, the, point, of, blackout, this, can, happen, at, any, depth, ascent, induced, hypoxia, is, caused, by, a, drop, in, oxygen, partial, pressure, as, ambient, pressure, is, reduced, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, at, depth, may, be, sufficient, to, maintain, consciousness, at, that, depth, and, not, at, the, reduced, pressures, nearer, the, surface, barotrauma, a, type, of, dysbarism, is, physical, damage, to, body, tissues, caused, by, a, difference, in, pressure, between, a, gas, space, inside, or, in, contact, with, the, body, and, the, surrounding, gas, or, fluid, it, typically, occurs, when, the, organism, is, exposed, to, a, large, change, in, ambient, pressure, such, as, when, a, diver, ascends, or, descends, when, diving, the, pressure, differences, which, cause, the, barotrauma, are, changes, in, hydrostatic, pressure, the, initial, damage, is, usually, due, to, over, stretching, the, tissues, in, tension, or, shear, either, directly, by, expansion, of, the, gas, in, the, closed, space, or, by, pressure, difference, hydrostatically, transmitted, through, the, tissue, barotrauma, generally, manifests, as, sinus, or, middle, ear, effects, decompression, sickness, lung, over, expansion, injuries, and, injuries, resulting, from, external, squeezes, barotraumas, of, descent, are, caused, by, preventing, the, free, change, of, volume, of, the, gas, in, a, closed, space, in, contact, with, the, diver, resulting, in, a, pressure, difference, between, the, tissues, and, the, gas, space, and, the, unbalanced, force, due, to, this, pressure, difference, causes, deformation, of, the, tissues, resulting, in, cell, rupture, barotraumas, of, ascent, are, also, caused, when, the, free, change, of, volume, of, the, gas, in, a, closed, space, in, contact, with, the, diver, is, prevented, in, this, case, the, pressure, difference, causes, a, resultant, tension, in, the, surrounding, tissues, which, exceeds, their, tensile, strength, besides, tissue, rupture, the, overpressure, may, cause, ingress, of, gases, into, the, adjoining, tissues, and, further, afield, by, bubble, transport, through, the, circulatory, system, this, can, cause, blockage, of, circulation, at, distant, sites, or, interfere, with, the, normal, function, of, an, organ, by, its, presence, provision, of, breathing, gas, at, ambient, pressure, can, greatly, prolong, the, duration, of, a, dive, but, there, are, other, problems, that, may, result, from, this, technological, solution, absorption, of, metabolically, inert, gases, is, increased, as, a, function, of, time, and, pressure, and, these, may, both, produce, undesirable, effects, immediately, as, a, consequence, of, their, presence, in, the, tissues, in, the, dissolved, state, such, as, nitrogen, narcosis, and, high, pressure, nervous, syndrome, or, cause, problems, when, coming, out, of, solution, within, the, tissues, during, decompression, other, problems, arise, when, the, concentration, of, metabolically, active, gases, is, increased, these, range, from, the, toxic, effects, of, oxygen, at, high, partial, pressure, through, buildup, of, carbon, dioxide, due, to, excessive, work, of, breathing, increased, dead, space, or, inefficient, removal, to, the, exacerbation, of, the, toxic, effects, of, contaminants, in, the, breathing, gas, due, to, the, increased, concentration, at, high, pressures, hydrostatic, pressure, differences, between, the, interior, of, the, lung, and, the, breathing, gas, delivery, increased, breathing, gas, density, due, to, ambient, pressure, and, increased, flow, resistance, due, to, higher, breathing, rates, may, all, cause, increased, work, of, breathing, fatigue, of, the, respiratory, muscles, and, a, physiological, limit, to, effective, ventilation, underwater, vision, is, affected, by, the, clarity, and, the, refractive, index, of, the, medium, visibility, underwater, is, reduced, because, light, passing, through, water, attenuates, rapidly, with, distance, leading, to, lower, levels, of, natural, illumination, underwater, objects, are, also, blurred, by, scattering, of, light, between, the, object, and, the, viewer, resulting, in, lower, contrast, these, effects, vary, with, the, wavelength, of, the, light, and, the, colour, and, turbidity, of, the, water, the, human, eye, is, optimised, for, air, vision, and, when, it, is, immersed, in, direct, contact, with, water, visual, acuity, is, adversely, affected, by, the, difference, in, refractive, index, between, water, and, air, provision, of, an, airspace, between, the, cornea, and, the, water, can, compensate, but, causes, scale, and, distance, distortion, artificial, illumination, can, improve, visibility, at, short, range, stereoscopic, acuity, the, ability, to, judge, relative, distances, of, different, objects, is, considerably, reduced, underwater, and, this, is, affected, by, the, field, of, vision, a, narrow, field, of, vision, caused, by, a, small, viewport, in, a, helmet, results, in, greatly, reduced, stereoacuity, and, an, apparent, movement, of, a, stationary, object, when, the, head, is, moved, these, effects, lead, to, poorer, hand, eye, coordination, water, has, different, acoustic, properties, from, those, of, air, sound, from, an, underwater, source, can, propagate, relatively, freely, through, body, tissues, where, there, is, contact, with, the, water, as, the, acoustic, properties, are, similar, when, the, head, is, exposed, to, the, water, some, sound, is, transmitted, by, the, eardrum, and, middle, ear, but, a, significant, part, reaches, the, cochlea, independently, by, bone, conduction, some, sound, localisation, is, possible, though, difficult, human, hearing, underwater, in, cases, where, the, diver, s, ear, is, wet, is, less, sensitive, than, in, air, frequency, sensitivity, underwater, also, differs, from, that, in, air, with, a, consistently, higher, threshold, of, hearing, underwater, sensitivity, to, higher, frequency, sounds, is, reduced, the, most, the, type, of, headgear, affects, noise, sensitivity, and, noise, hazard, depending, on, whether, transmission, is, wet, or, dry, human, hearing, underwater, is, less, sensitive, with, wet, ears, than, in, air, and, a, neoprene, hood, causes, substantial, attenuation, when, wearing, a, helmet, hearing, sensitivity, is, similar, to, that, in, surface, air, as, it, is, not, greatly, affected, by, the, breathing, gas, or, chamber, atmosphere, composition, or, pressure, because, sound, travels, faster, in, heliox, than, in, air, voice, formants, are, raised, making, divers, speech, high, pitched, and, distorted, and, hard, to, understand, for, people, not, used, to, it, the, increased, density, of, breathing, gases, under, pressure, has, a, similar, and, additive, effect, tactile, sensory, perception, in, divers, may, be, impaired, by, the, environmental, protection, suit, and, low, temperatures, the, combination, of, instability, equipment, neutral, buoyancy, and, resistance, to, movement, by, the, inertial, and, viscous, effects, of, the, water, encumbers, the, diver, cold, causes, losses, in, sensory, and, motor, function, and, distracts, from, and, disrupts, cognitive, activity, the, ability, to, exert, large, and, precise, force, is, reduced, balance, and, equilibrium, depend, on, vestibular, function, and, secondary, input, from, visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic, and, sometimes, auditory, senses, which, are, processed, by, the, central, nervous, system, to, provide, the, sense, of, balance, underwater, some, of, these, inputs, may, be, absent, or, diminished, making, the, remaining, cues, more, important, conflicting, input, may, result, in, vertigo, disorientation, and, motion, sickness, the, vestibular, sense, is, essential, in, these, conditions, for, rapid, intricate, and, accurate, movement, proprioceptive, perception, makes, the, diver, aware, of, personal, position, and, movement, in, association, with, the, vestibular, and, visual, input, and, allows, the, diver, to, function, effectively, in, maintaining, physical, equilibrium, and, balance, in, the, water, in, the, water, at, neutral, buoyancy, the, proprioceptive, cues, of, position, are, reduced, or, absent, this, effect, may, be, exacerbated, by, the, diver, s, suit, and, other, equipment, taste, and, smell, are, not, very, important, to, the, diver, in, the, water, but, more, important, to, the, saturation, diver, while, in, accommodation, chambers, there, is, evidence, of, a, slight, decrease, in, threshold, for, taste, and, smell, after, extended, periods, under, pressure, there, are, several, modes, of, diving, distinguished, largely, by, the, breathing, gas, supply, system, used, and, whether, the, diver, is, exposed, to, the, ambient, pressure, the, diving, equipment, support, equipment, and, procedures, are, largely, determined, by, the, mode, the, ability, to, dive, and, swim, underwater, while, holding, one, s, breath, is, considered, a, useful, emergency, skill, an, important, part, of, water, sport, and, navy, safety, training, and, an, enjoyable, leisure, activity, underwater, diving, without, breathing, apparatus, can, be, categorised, as, underwater, swimming, snorkelling, and, freediving, these, categories, overlap, considerably, several, competitive, underwater, sports, are, practised, without, breathing, apparatus, freediving, precludes, the, use, of, external, breathing, devices, and, relies, on, the, ability, of, divers, to, hold, their, breath, until, resurfacing, the, technique, ranges, from, simple, breath, hold, diving, to, competitive, apnea, dives, fins, and, a, diving, mask, are, often, used, in, free, diving, to, improve, vision, and, provide, more, efficient, propulsion, a, short, breathing, tube, called, a, snorkel, allows, the, diver, to, breathe, at, the, surface, while, the, face, is, immersed, snorkelling, on, the, surface, with, no, intention, of, diving, is, a, popular, water, sport, and, recreational, activity, scuba, diving, is, diving, with, a, self, contained, underwater, breathing, apparatus, which, is, completely, independent, of, surface, supply, scuba, gives, the, diver, mobility, and, horizontal, range, far, beyond, the, reach, of, an, umbilical, hose, attached, to, surface, supplied, diving, equipment, ssde, scuba, divers, engaged, in, armed, forces, covert, operations, may, be, referred, to, as, frogmen, combat, divers, or, attack, swimmers, open, circuit, scuba, systems, discharge, the, breathing, gas, into, the, environment, as, it, is, exhaled, and, consist, of, one, or, more, diving, cylinders, containing, breathing, gas, at, high, pressure, which, is, supplied, to, the, diver, through, a, diving, regulator, they, may, include, additional, cylinders, for, decompression, gas, or, emergency, breathing, gas, closed, circuit, or, semi, closed, circuit, rebreather, scuba, systems, allow, recycling, of, exhaled, gases, the, volume, of, gas, used, is, reduced, compared, to, that, of, open, circuit, so, a, smaller, cylinder, or, cylinders, may, be, used, for, an, equivalent, dive, duration, they, greatly, extend, the, time, spent, underwater, as, compared, to, open, circuit, for, the, same, gas, consumption, rebreathers, produce, fewer, bubbles, and, less, noise, than, scuba, which, makes, them, attractive, to, covert, military, divers, to, avoid, detection, scientific, divers, to, avoid, disturbing, marine, animals, and, media, divers, to, avoid, bubble, interference, a, scuba, diver, moves, underwater, primarily, by, using, fins, attached, to, the, feet, external, propulsion, can, be, provided, by, a, diver, propulsion, vehicle, or, a, towboard, pulled, from, the, surface, other, equipment, includes, a, diving, mask, to, improve, underwater, vision, a, protective, diving, suit, equipment, to, control, buoyancy, and, equipment, related, to, the, specific, circumstances, and, purpose, of, the, dive, scuba, divers, are, trained, in, the, procedures, and, skills, appropriate, to, their, level, of, certification, by, instructors, affiliated, to, the, diver, certification, organisations, which, issue, these, diver, certifications, these, include, standard, operating, procedures, for, using, the, equipment, and, dealing, with, the, general, hazards, of, the, underwater, environment, and, emergency, procedures, for, self, help, and, assistance, of, a, similarly, equipped, diver, experiencing, problems, a, minimum, level, of, fitness, and, health, is, required, by, most, training, organisations, and, a, higher, level, of, fitness, may, be, needed, for, some, applications, an, alternative, to, self, contained, breathing, systems, is, to, supply, breathing, gases, from, the, surface, through, a, hose, when, combined, with, a, communication, cable, a, pneumofathometer, hose, and, a, safety, line, it, is, called, the, diver, s, umbilical, which, may, include, a, hot, water, hose, for, heating, video, cable, and, breathing, gas, reclaim, line, the, diver, wears, a, full, face, mask, or, helmet, and, gas, may, be, supplied, on, demand, or, as, a, continuous, free, flow, more, basic, equipment, that, uses, only, an, air, hose, is, called, an, airline, or, hookah, system, this, allows, the, diver, to, breathe, using, an, air, supply, hose, from, a, high, pressure, cylinder, or, diving, air, compressor, at, the, surface, breathing, gas, is, supplied, through, a, mouth, held, demand, valve, or, light, full, face, mask, airline, diving, is, used, for, work, such, as, hull, cleaning, and, archaeological, surveys, for, shellfish, harvesting, and, as, snuba, a, shallow, water, activity, typically, practised, by, tourists, and, those, who, are, not, scuba, certified, saturation, diving, lets, professional, divers, live, and, work, under, pressure, for, days, or, weeks, at, a, time, after, working, in, the, water, the, divers, rest, and, live, in, a,

floating, platform, at, a, similar, pressure, to, the, work, depth, they, are, transferred, between, the, surface, accommodation, and, the, underwater, workplace, in, a, pressurised, closed, diving, bell, decompression, at, the, end, of, the, dive, may, take, many, days, but, since, it, is, done, only, once, for, a, long, period, of, exposure, rather, than, after, each, of, many, shorter, exposures, the, overall, risk, of, decompression, injury, to, the, diver, and, the, total, time, spent, decompressing, are, reduced, this, type, of, diving, allows, greater, work, efficiency, and, safety, commercial, divers, refer, to, diving, operations, where, the, diver, starts, and, finishes, the, diving, operation, at, atmospheric, pressure, as, surface, oriented, or, bounce, diving, the,

for, the, experience, of, diving, most, divers, have, some, additional, reason, for, being, underwater, recreational, diving, is, purely, for, enjoyment, and, has, several, specialisations, and, technical, disciplines, to, provide, more, scope, for, varied, activities, for, which, specialist, training, can, be, offered, such, as, cave, diving, wreck, diving, ice, diving, and, deep, diving, several, underwater, sports, are, available, for, exercise, and, competition, there, are, various, aspects, of, professional, diving, that, range, from, part, time, work, to, lifelong, careers, professionals, in, the, recreational, diving, industry, include, instructor, trainers, diving, instructors, assistant, instructors, divemasters, dive, guides, and, scuba, technicians, a, scuba, diving, tourism, industry, has, developed, to, service, recreational, diving, in, regions, with, popular, dive, sites, commercial, diving, is, industry, related, and, includes, engineering, tasks, such, as, in, hydrocarbon, exploration, offshore, construction, dam, maintenance, and, harbour, works, commercial, divers, may, also, be, employed, to, perform, tasks, related, to, marine, activities, such, as, naval, diving, ships, husbandry, marine, salvage, or, aquaculture, other, specialist, areas, of, diving, include, military, diving, with, a, long, history, of, military, frogmen, in,

service, sea, rescue, or, lifeguard, unit, and, this, may, be, classed, as, public, safety, diving, there, are, also, professional, media, divers, such, as, underwater, photographers, and, videographers, who, record, the, underwater, world, and, scientific, divers, in, fields, of, study, which, involve, the, underwater, environment, including, marine, biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers, speleologists, and, underwater, archaeologists, the, choice, between, scuba, and, surface, supplied, diving, equipment, is, based, on, both, legal, and, logistical, constraints, where, the, diver, requires, mobility, and, a, large, range, of, movement, scuba, is, usually, the, choice, if, safety, and, legal, constraints, allow, higher, risk, work, particularly, commercial, diving, may, be, restricted, to, surface, supplied, equipment, by, legislation, and, codes, of, practice, freediving, as, a, widespread, means, of, hunting, and, gathering, both, for, food, and, other, valuable, resources, such, as, pearls, and, coral, dates, from, before, 4500, bce, by, classical, greek, and, roman, times, commercial, diving, applications, such, as, sponge, diving, and, marine, salvage, were, established, military, diving, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, peloponnesian, war, with, recreational, and, sporting, applications, being, a, recent, development, technological, development, in, ambient, pressure, diving, started, with, stone, weights, skandalopetra, for, fast, descent, with, rope, assist, for, ascent, the, diving, bell, is, one, of, the, earliest, types, of, equipment, for, underwater, work, and, exploration, its, use, was, first, described, by, aristotle, in, the, 4th, century, bce, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, ce, diving, bells, became, more, useful, when, a, renewable, supply, of, air, could, be, provided, to, the, diver, at, depth, and, progressed, to, surface, supplied, diving, helmets, in, effect, miniature, diving, bells, covering, the, diver, s, head, and, supplied, with, compressed, air, by, manually, operated, pumps, which, were, improved, by, attaching, a, waterproof, suit, to, the, helmet, in, the, early, 19th, century, these, became, the, standard, diving, dress, which, made, a, far, wider, range, of, marine, civil, engineering, and, salvage, projects, practicable, limitations, in, mobility, of, the, surface, supplied, systems, encouraged, the, development, of, both, open, circuit, and, closed, circuit, scuba, in, the, 20th, century, which, allow, the, diver, a, much, greater, autonomy, these, became, popular, during, the, second, world, war, for, clandestine, military, operations, and, post, war, for, scientific, search, and, rescue, media, diving, recreational, and, technical, diving, the, heavy, free, flow, surface, supplied, copper, helmets, evolved, into, lightweight, demand, helmets, which, are, more, economical, with, breathing, gas, important, for, deeper, dives, using, expensive, helium, based, breathing, mixtures, saturation, diving, reduced, the, risks, of, decompression, sickness, for, deep, and, long, exposures, an, alternative, approach, was, the, development, of, the, ads, or, armoured, suit, which, isolates, the, diver, from, the, pressure, at, depth, at, the, cost, of, mechanical, complexity, and, limited, dexterity, the, technology, first, became, practicable, in, the, middle, 20th, century, isolation, of, the, diver, from, the, environment, was, taken, further, by, the, development, of, remotely, operated, underwater, vehicles, rov, or, rouv, in, the, late, 20th, century, where, the, operator, controls, the, rov, from, the, surface, and, autonomous, underwater, vehicles, auv, which, dispense, with, an, operator, altogether, all, of, these, modes, are, still, in, use, and, each, has, a, range, of, applications, where, it, has, advantages, over, the, others, though, diving, bells, have, largely, been, relegated, to, a, means, of, transport, for, surface, supplied, divers, in, some, cases, combinations, are, particularly, effective, such, as, the, simultaneous, use, of, surface, orientated, or, saturation, surface, supplied, diving, equipment, and, work, or, observation, class, remotely, operated, vehicles, by, the, late, 19th, century, as, salvage, operations, became, deeper, and, longer, an, unexplained, malady, began, afflicting, the, divers, they, would, suffer, breathing, difficulties, dizziness, joint, pain, and, paralysis, sometimes, leading, to, death, the, problem, was, already, well, known, among, workers, building, tunnels, and, bridge, footings, operating, under, pressure, in, caissons, and, was, initially, called, caisson, disease, it, was, later, renamed, the, bends, because, the, joint, pain, typically, caused, the, sufferer, to, stoop, early, reports, of, the, disease, had, been, made, at, the, time, of, charles, pasley, s, salvage, operation, but, scientists, were, still, ignorant, of, its, causes, french, physiologist, paul, bert, was, the, first, to, understand, it, as, decompression, sickness, dcs, his, work, la, pression, barom, trique, 1878, was, a, comprehensive, investigation, into, the, physiological, effects, of, air, pressure, both, above, and, below, the, normal, he, determined, that, inhaling, pressurised, air, caused, nitrogen, to, dissolve, into, the, bloodstream, rapid, depressurisation, would, then, release, the, nitrogen, into, its, gaseous, state, forming, bubbles, that, could, block, the, blood, circulation, and, potentially, cause, paralysis, or, death, central, nervous, system, oxygen, toxicity, was, also, first, described, in, this, publication, and, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, paul, bert, effect, john, scott, haldane, designed, a, decompression, chamber, in, 1907, and, he, produced, the, first, decompression, tables, for, the, royal, navy, in, 1908, after, extensive, experiments, with, animals, and, human, subjects, these, tables, established, a, method, of, decompression, in, stages, it, remains, the, basis, for, decompression, methods, to, this, day, following, haldane, s, recommendation, the, maximum, safe, operating, depth, for, divers, was, extended, to, 61, metres, 200, ft, the, us, navy, continued, research, into, decompression, and, in, 1915, the, first, bureau, of, construction, and, repair, decompression, tables, were, developed, by, french, and, stilson, experimental, dives, were, conducted, in, the, 1930s, forming, the, basis, for, the, 1937, us, navy, air, decompression, tables, surface, decompression, and, oxygen, use, were, also, researched, in, the, 1930s, the, us, navy, 1957, tables, were, developed, to, correct, problems, found, in, the, 1937, tables, in, 1965, hugh, lemessurier, and, brian, andrew, hills, published, their, paper, a, thermodynamic, approach, arising, from, a, study, on, torres, strait, diving, techniques, which, suggested, that, decompression, following, schedules, based, on, conventional, models, results, in, asymptomatic, bubble, formation, which, must, then, be, re, dissolved, at, the, decompression, stops, before, it, can, be, eliminated, this, is, slower, than, allowing, the, gas, to, be, eliminated, while, it, is, still, in, solution, and, indicates, the, importance, of, minimising, bubble, phase, gas, for, efficient, decompression, m, p, spencer, showed, that, doppler, ultrasonic, methods, can, detect, venous, bubbles, in, asymptomatic, divers, and, dr, andrew, pilmanis, showed, that, safety, stops, reduced, bubble, formation, in, 1981, d, e, yount, described, the, varying, permeability, model, proposing, a, mechanism, of, bubble, formation, several, other, bubble, models, followed, the, pathophysiology, of, decompression, sickness, is, not, yet, fully, understood, but, decompression, practice, has, reached, a, stage, where, the, risk, is, fairly, low, and, most, incidents, are, successfully, treated, by, therapeutic, recompression, and, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, mixed, breathing, gases, are, used, to, reduce, the, effects, of, the, hyperbaric, environment, on, ambient, pressure, divers, efficient, decompression, requires, the, diver, to, ascend, fast, enough, to, establish, as, high, a, decompression, gradient, in, as, many, tissues, as, safely, possible, without, provoking, the, development, of, symptomatic, bubbles, this, is, facilitated, by, the, highest, acceptably, safe, oxygen, partial, pressure, in, the, breathing, gas, and, avoiding, gas, changes, that, could, cause, counterdiffusion, bubble, formation, or, growth, the, development, of, schedules, that, are, both, safe, and, efficient, has, been, complicated, by, the, large, number, of, variables, and, uncertainties, including, personal, variation, in, response, under, varying, environmental, conditions, and, workload, the, diving, environment, is, limited, by, accessibility, and, risk, but, includes, water, and, occasionally, other, liquids, most, underwater, diving, is, done, in, the, shallower, coastal, parts, of, the, oceans, and, inland, bodies, of, fresh, water, including, lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded, caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming, pools, and, canals, but, may, also, be, done, in, large, bore, ducting, and, sewers, power, station, cooling, systems, cargo, and, ballast, tanks, of, ships, and, liquid, filled, industrial, equipment, the, environment, may, affect, gear, configuration, for, instance, freshwater, is, less, dense, than, saltwater, so, less, added, weight, is, needed, to, achieve, diver, neutral, buoyancy, in, freshwater, dives, water, temperature, visibility, and, movement, also, affect, the, diver, and, the, dive, plan, diving, in, liquids, other, than, water, may, present, special, problems, due, to, density, viscosity, and, chemical, compatibility, of, diving, equipment, as, well, as, possible, environmental, hazards, to, the, diving, team, benign, conditions, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, confined, water, are, environments, of, low, risk, where, it, is, extremely, unlikely, or, impossible, for, the, diver, to, get, lost, or, entrapped, or, be, exposed, to, hazards, other, than, the, basic, underwater, environment, these, conditions, are, suitable, for, initial, training, in, the, critical, survival, skills, and, include, swimming, pools, training, tanks, aquarium, tanks, and, some, shallow, and, protected, shoreline, areas, open, water, is, unrestricted, water, such, as, a, sea, lake, or, flooded, quarry, where, the, diver, has, unobstructed, direct, vertical, access, to, the, surface, of, the, water, in, contact, with, the, atmosphere, open, water, diving, implies, that, if, a, problem, arises, the, diver, can, directly, ascend, vertically, to, the, atmosphere, to, breathe, air, wall, diving, is, done, along, a, near, vertical, face, blue, water, diving, is, done, in, good, visibility, in, mid, water, where, the, bottom, is, out, of, sight, of, the, diver, and, there, may, be, no, fixed, visual, reference, black, water, diving, is, mid, water, diving, at, night, particularly, on, a, moonless, night, an, overhead, or, penetration, diving, environment, is, where, the, diver, enters, a, space, from, which, there, is, no, direct, purely, vertical, ascent, to, the, safety, of, breathable, atmosphere, at, the, surface, cave, diving, wreck, diving, ice, diving, and, diving, inside, or, under, other, natural, or, artificial, underwater, structures, or, enclosures, are, examples, the, restriction, on, direct, ascent, increases, the, risk, of, diving, under, an, overhead, and, this, is, usually, addressed, by, adaptations, of, procedures, and, use, of, equipment, such, as, redundant, breathing, gas, sources, and, guide, lines, to, indicate, the, route, to, the, exit, night, diving, can, allow, the, diver, to, experience, a, different, underwater, environment, because, many, marine, animals, are, nocturnal, altitude, diving, for, example, in, mountain, lakes, requires, modifications, to, the, decompression, schedule, because, of, the, reduced, atmospheric, pressure, the, recreational, diving, depth, limit, set, by, the, en, 14153, 2, iso, 24801, 2, level, 2, autonomous, diver, standard, is, 20, metres, 66, ft, the,

professional, diving, is, done, where, the, work, needs, to, be, done, and, recreational, diving, is, done, where, conditions, are, suitable, there, are, many, recorded, and, publicised, recreational, dive, sites, which, are, known, for, their, convenience, points, of, interest, and, frequently, favourable, conditions, diver, training, facilities, for, both, professional, and, recreational, divers, generally, use, a, small, range, of, dive, sites, which, are, familiar, and, convenient, and, where, conditions, are, predictable, and, the, environmental, risk, is, relatively, low, due, to, the, inherent, risks, of, the, environment, and, the, necessity, to, operate, the, equipment, correctly, both, under, normal, conditions, and, during, incidents, where, failure, to, respond, appropriately, and, quickly, can, have, fatal, consequences, standard, procedures, are, used, in, preparation, of, the, equipment, preparation, to, dive, during, the, dive, if, all, goes, according, to, plan, after, the, dive, and, in, the, event, of, a, reasonably, foreseeable, contingency, the, standard, procedures, are, not, necessarily, the, only, course, of, action, that, will, have, a, satisfactory, outcome, but, they, are, generally, procedures, which, have, been, found, by, experiment, and, experience, to, work, well, and, reliably, when, applied, in, response, to, the, given, circumstances, all, formal, diver, training, is, based, on, the, learning, of, standard, skills, and, procedures, and, in, many, cases, the, over, learning, of, critical, skills, until, the, procedures, can, be, performed, without, hesitation, even, when, distracting, circumstances, exist, where, reasonably, practicable, checklists, may, be, used, to, ensure, that, preparatory, procedures, are, carried, out, in, the, correct, sequence, and, that, no, steps, are, inadvertently, omitted, some, procedures, are, common, to, all, manned, modes, of, diving, but, most, are, specific, to, the, mode, of, diving, and, many, are, specific, to, the, equipment, in, use, diving, procedures, are, those, which, are, directly, relevant, to, diving, safety, and, efficiency, but, do, not, include, task, specific, skills, standard, procedures, are, particularly, helpful, where, communication, is, by, hand, or, rope, signal, the, hand, and, line, signals, are, examples, of, standard, procedures, themselves, as, the, communicating, parties, have, a, better, idea, of, what, the, other, is, likely, to, do, in, response, where, voice, communication, is, available, standardised, communications, protocol, reduces, the, time, needed, to, convey, necessary, information, and, the, error, rate, in, transmission, diving, procedures, generally, involve, the, correct, application, of, the, appropriate, diving, skills, in, response, to, the, current, circumstances, and, range, from, selecting, and, testing, equipment, to, suit, the, diver, and, the, dive, plan, to, the, rescue, of, oneself, or, another, diver, in, a, life, threatening, emergency, in, many, cases, what, might, be, a, life, threatening, emergency, to, an, untrained, or, inadequately, skilled, diver, is, a, mere, annoyance, and, minor, distraction, to, a, skilled, diver, who, applies, the, correct, procedure, without, hesitation, professional, diving, operations, tend, to, adhere, more, rigidly, to, standard, operating, procedures, than, recreational, divers, who, are, not, legally, or, contractually, obliged, to, follow, them, but, the, prevalence, of, diving, accidents, is, known, to, be, strongly, correlated, to, human, error, which, is, more, common, in, divers, with, less, training, and, experience, the, doing, it, right, philosophy, of, technical, diving, is, strongly, supportive, of, common, standard, procedures, for, all, members, of, a, dive, team, and, prescribes, the, procedures, and, equipment, configuration, which, may, affect, procedures, to, the, members, of, their, organisations, the, terms, diving, skills, and, diving, procedures, are, largely, interchangeable, but, a, procedure, may, require, the, ordered, application, of, several, skills, and, is, a, broader, term, a, procedure, may, also, conditionally, branch, or, require, repeated, applications, of, a, skill, depending, on, circumstances, diver, training, is, structured, around, the, learning, and, practice, of, standard, procedures, until, the, diver, is, assessed, as, competent, to, apply, them, reliably, in, reasonably, foreseeable, circumstances, and, the, certification, issued, limits, the, diver, to, environments, and, equipment, that, are, compatible, with, their, training, and, assessed, skill, levels, the, teaching, and, assessment, of, diving, skills, and, procedures, is, often, restricted, to, registered, instructors, who, have, been, assessed, as, competent, to, teach, and, assess, those, skills, by, the, certification, or, registration, agency, who, take, the, responsibility, of, declaring, the, diver, competent, against, their, assessment, criteria, the, teaching, and, assessment, of, other, task, oriented, skills, does, not, generally, require, a, diving, instructor, there, is, considerable, difference, in, the, diving, procedures, of, professional, divers, where, a, diving, team, with, formally, appointed, members, in, specific, roles, and, with, recognised, competence, is, required, by, law, and, recreational, diving, where, in, most, jurisdictions, the, diver, is, not, constrained, by, specific, laws, and, in, many, cases, is, not, required, to, provide, any, evidence, of, competence, underwater, diver, training, is, normally, given, by, a, qualified, instructor, who, is, a, member, of, one, of, many, diver, training, agencies, or, is, registered, with, a, government, agency, basic, diver, training, entails, the, learning, of, skills, required, for, the, safe, conduct, of, activities, in, an, underwater, environment, and, includes, procedures, and, skills, for, the, use, of, diving, equipment, safety, emergency, self, help, and, rescue, procedures, dive, planning, and, use, of, dive, tables, diving, hand, signals, are, used, to, communicate, underwater, professional, divers, will, also, learn, other, methods, of, communication, an, entry, level, diver, must, learn, the, techniques, of, breathing, underwater, through, a, demand, regulator, including, clearing, it, of, water, and, recovering, it, if, dislodged, from, the, mouth, and, clearing, the, mask, if, it, is, flooded, these, are, critical, survival, skills, and, if, not, competent, the, diver, is, at, a, high, risk, of, drowning, a, related, skill, is, sharing, breathing, gas, with, another, diver, both, as, the, donor, and, the, recipient, this, is, usually, done, with, a, secondary, demand, valve, carried, for, this, purpose, technical, and, professional, divers, will, also, learn, how, to, use, a, backup, gas, supply, carried, in, an, independent, scuba, set, known, as, the, emergency, gas, supply, or, bailout, cylinder, to, avoid, injury, during, descent, divers, must, be, competent, at, equalising, the, ears, sinuses, and, mask, they, must, also, learn, not, to, hold, their, breath, while, ascending, to, avoid, barotrauma, of, the, lungs, the, speed, of, ascent, must, be, controlled, to, avoid, decompression, sickness, which, requires, buoyancy, control, skills, good, buoyancy, control, and, trim, also, allow, the, diver, to, manoeuvre, and, move, about, safely, comfortably, and, efficiently, using, swimfins, for, propulsion, some, knowledge, of, physiology, and, the, physics, of, diving, is, considered, necessary, by, most, diver, certification, agencies, as, the, diving, environment, is, alien, and, relatively, hostile, to, humans, the, physics, and, physiology, knowledge, required, is, fairly, basic, and, helps, the, diver, to, understand, the, effects, of, the, diving, environment, so, that, informed, acceptance, of, the, associated, risks, is, possible, the, physics, mostly, relates, to, gases, under, pressure, buoyancy, heat, loss, and, light, underwater, the, physiology, relates, the, physics, to, the, effects, on, the, human, body, to, provide, a, basic, understanding, of, the, causes, and, risks, of, barotrauma, decompression, sickness, gas, toxicity, hypothermia, drowning, and, sensory, variations, more, advanced, training, often, involves, first, aid, and, rescue, skills, skills, related, to, specialised, diving, equipment, and, underwater, work, skills, further, training, is, required, to, develop, the, skills, necessary, for, diving, in, a, wider, range, of, environments, with, specialised, equipment, and, to, become, competent, to, perform, a, variety, of, underwater, tasks, the, medical, aspects, of, diving, and, hyperbaric, exposure, include, examination, of, divers, to, establish, medical, fitness, to, dive, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, diving, disorders, treatment, by, recompression, and, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, toxic, effects, of, gases, in, a, hyperbaric, environment, and, treatment, of, injuries, incurred, while, diving, which, are, not, directly, associated, with, immersion, depth, or, pressure, medical, fitness, to, dive, is, the, medical, and, physical, suitability, of, a, diver, to, function, safely, in, the, underwater, environment, using, underwater, diving, equipment, and, procedures, as, a, general, principle, fitness, to, dive, is, dependent, on, the, absence, of, conditions, which, would, constitute, an, unacceptable, risk, for, the, diver, and, for, professional, divers, to, any, member, of, the, diving, team, general, physical, fitness, requirements, are, also, often, specified, by, a, certifying, agency, and, are, usually, related, to, ability, to, swim, and, perform, the, activities, that, are, associated, with, the, relevant, type, of, diving, the, general, hazards, of, diving, are, much, the, same, for, recreational, divers, and, professional, divers, but, the, risks, vary, with, the, diving, procedures, used, these, risks, are, reduced, by, appropriate, skills, and, equipment, medical, fitness, to, dive, generally, implies, that, the, diver, has, no, known, medical, conditions, that, limit, the, ability, to, do, the, job, or, jeopardise, the, safety, of, the, diver, or, the, team, that, might, get, worse, as, an, consequence, of, diving, or, unacceptably, predispose, the, diver, to, diving, or, occupational, illness, depending, on, the, circumstances, fitness, to, dive, may, be, established, by, a, signed, statement, by, the, diver, that, he, or, she, does, not, suffer, from, any, of, the, disqualifying, conditions, and, is, able, to, manage, the, ordinary, physical, requirements, of, diving, by, a, detailed, medical, examination, by, a, physician, registered, as, a, medical, examiner, of, divers, following, a, prescribed, procedural, checklist, attested, by, a, legal, document, of, fitness, to, dive, issued, by, the, medical, examiner, and, recorded, on, a, national, database, or, by, alternatives, between, these, extremes, psychological, fitness, to, dive, is, not, normally, evaluated, before, recreational, or, commercial, diver, training, but, can, influence, the, safety, and, success, of, a, diving, career, diving, medicine, is, the, diagnosis, treatment, and, prevention, of, conditions, caused, by, exposing, divers, to, the, underwater, environment, it, includes, the, effects, of, pressure, on, gas, filled, spaces, in, and, in, contact, with, the, body, and, of, partial, pressures, of, breathing, gas, components, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, conditions, caused, by, marine, hazards, and, how, fitness, to, dive, and, the, side, effects, of,

hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, is, the, definitive, treatment, for, two, of, the, most, important, diving, related, illnesses, decompression, sickness, and, arterial, gas, embolism, diving, medicine, deals, with, medical, research, on, issues, of, diving, the, prevention, of, diving, disorders, treatment, of, diving, accident, injuries, and, diving, fitness, the, field, includes, the, effect, on, the, human, body, of, breathing, gases, and, their, contaminants, under, high, pressure, and, the, relationship, between, the, state, of, physical, and, psychological, health, of, the, diver, and, safety, in, diving, accidents, it, is, common, for, multiple, disorders, to, occur, together, and, interact, with, each, other, both, causatively, and, as, complications, diving, medicine, is, a, branch, of, occupational, medicine, and, sports, medicine, and, first, aid, and, recognition, of, symptoms, of, diving, disorders, are, important, parts, of, diver, education, risk, is, a, combination, of, hazard, vulnerability, and, likelihood, of, occurrence, which, can, be, the, probability, of, a, specific, undesirable, consequence, of, a, hazard, or, the, combined, probability, of, undesirable, consequences, of, all, the, hazards, of, an, activity, the, presence, of, a, combination, of, several, hazards, simultaneously, is, common, in, diving, and, the, effect, is, generally, increased, risk, to, the, diver, particularly, where, the, occurrence, of, an, incident, due, to, one, hazard, triggers, other, hazards, with, a, resulting, cascade, of, incidents, many, diving, fatalities, are, the, result, of, a, cascade, of, incidents, overwhelming, the, diver, who, should, be, able, to, manage, any, single, reasonably, foreseeable, incident, and, its, probable, direct, consequences, commercial, diving, operations, may, expose, the, diver, to, more, and, sometimes, greater, hazards, than, recreational, diving, but, the, associated, occupational, health, and, safety, legislation, is, less, tolerant, of, risk, than, recreational, particularly, technical, divers, may, be, prepared, to, accept, commercial, diving, operations, are, also, constrained, by, the, physical, realities, of, the, operating, environment, and, expensive, engineering, solutions, are, often, necessary, to, control, risk, a, formal, hazard, identification, and, risk, assessment, is, a, standard, and, required, part, of, the, planning, for, a, commercial, diving, operation, and, this, is, also, the, case, for, offshore, diving, operations, the, occupation, is, inherently, hazardous, and, great, effort, and, expense, are, routinely, incurred, to, keep, the, risk, within, an, acceptable, range, the, standard, methods, of, reducing, risk, are, followed, where, possible, statistics, on, injuries, related, to, commercial, diving, are, normally, collected, by, national, regulators, in, the, uk, the, health, and, safety, executive, hse, is, responsible, for, the, overview, of, about, 5, 000, commercial, divers, in, norway, the, corresponding, authority, is, the, petroleum, safety, authority, norway, psa, which, has, maintained, the, dsys, database, since, 1985, gathering, statistics, on, over, 50, 000, diver, hours, of, commercial, activity, per, year, the, risks, of, dying, during, recreational, scientific, or, commercial, diving, are, small, and, for, scuba, diving, deaths, are, usually, associated, with, poor, gas, management, poor, buoyancy, control, equipment, misuse, entrapment, rough, water, conditions, and, pre, existing, health, problems, some, fatalities, are, inevitable, and, caused, by, unforeseeable, situations, escalating, out, of, control, but, the, majority, of, diving, fatalities, can, be, attributed, to, human, error, on, the, part, of, the, victim, during, 2006, to, 2015, there, were, an, estimated, 306, million, recreational, dives, made, by, us, residents, and, 563, recreational, diving, deaths, from, this, population, the, fatality, rate, was, 1, 8, per, million, recreational, dives, and, 47, deaths, for, every, 1000, emergency, department, presentations, for, scuba, injuries, scuba, diving, fatalities, have, a, major, financial, impact, by, way, of, lost, income, lost, business, insurance, premium, increases, and, high, litigation, costs, equipment, failure, is, rare, in, open, circuit, scuba, and, when, the, cause, of, death, is, recorded, as, drowning, it, is, usually, the, consequence, of, an, uncontrollable, series, of, events, in, which, drowning, is, the, endpoint, because, it, occurred, in, water, while, the, initial, cause, remains, unknown, where, the, triggering, event, is, known, it, is, most, commonly, a, shortage, of, breathing, gas, followed, by, buoyancy, problems, air, embolism, is, also, frequently, cited, as, a, cause, of, death, often, as, a, consequence, of, other, factors, leading, to, an, uncontrolled, and, badly, managed, ascent, occasionally, aggravated, by, medical, conditions, about, a, quarter, of, diving, fatalities, are, associated, with, cardiac, events, mostly, in, older, divers, there, is, a, fairly, large, body, of, data, on, diving, fatalities, but, in, many, cases, the, data, are, poor, due, to, the, standard, of, investigation, and, reporting, this, hinders, research, which, could, improve, diver, safety, artisanal, fishermen, and, gatherers, of, marine, organisms, in, less, developed, countries, may, expose, themselves, to, relatively, high, risk, using, diving, equipment, if, they, do, not, understand, the, physiological, hazards, particularly, if, they, use, inadequate, equipment, divers, operate, in, an, environment, for, which, the, human, body, is, not, well, suited, they, face, special, physical, and, health, risks, when, they, go, underwater, or, use, high, pressure, breathing, gas, the, consequences, of, diving, incidents, range, from, merely, annoying, to, rapidly, fatal, and, the, result, often, depends, on, the, equipment, skill, response, and, fitness, of, the, diver, and, diving, team, the, hazards, include, the, aquatic, environment, the, use, of, breathing, equipment, in, an, underwater, environment, exposure, to, a, pressurised, environment, and, pressure, changes, particularly, pressure, changes, during, descent, and, ascent, and, breathing, gases, at, high, ambient, pressure, diving, equipment, other, than, breathing, apparatus, is, usually, reliable, but, has, been, known, to, fail, and, loss, of, buoyancy, control, or, thermal, protection, can, be, a, major, burden, which, may, lead, to, more, serious, problems, there, are, also, hazards, of, the, specific, diving, environment, which, include, strong, water, movement, and, local, pressure, differentials, and, hazards, related, to, access, to, and, egress, from, the, water, which, vary, from, place, to, place, and, may, also, vary, with, time, hazards, inherent, in, the, diver, include, pre, existing, physiological, and, psychological, conditions, and, the, personal, behaviour, and, competence, of, the, individual, for, those, pursuing, other, activities, while, diving, there, are, additional, hazards, of, task, loading, of, the, dive, task, and, of, special, equipment, associated, with, the, task, the, major, factors, influencing, diving, safety, are, the, environment, the, diving, equipment, and, the, performance, of, the, diver, and, the, dive, team, the, underwater, environment, is, alien, both, physically, and, psychologically, stressful, and, usually, not, amenable, to, control, though, divers, can, be, selective, of, the, conditions, in, which, they, are, willing, to, dive, the, other, factors, must, be, controlled, to, mitigate, the, overall, stress, on, the, diver, and, allow, the, dive, to, be, completed, in, acceptable, safety, the, equipment, is, critical, to, diver, safety, for, life, support, but, is, generally, reliable, controllable, and, predictable, in, its, performance, human, factors, are, the, physical, or, cognitive, properties, of, individuals, or, social, behaviour, specific, to, humans, which, influence, functioning, of, technological, systems, as, well, as, human, environment, equilibrium, human, error, is, inevitable, and, everyone, makes, mistakes, at, some, time, and, the, consequences, of, these, errors, are, varied, and, depend, on, many, factors, most, errors, are, minor, and, do, not, cause, harm, but, in, a, high, risk, environment, such, as, in, diving, errors, are, more, likely, to, have, catastrophic, consequences, examples, of, human, error, leading, to, accidents, are, available, in, vast, numbers, as, it, is, the, direct, cause, of, 60, to, 80, of, all, accidents, human, error, and, panic, are, considered, to, be, the, leading, causes, of, diving, accidents, and, fatalities, a, study, by, william, p, morgan, indicates, that, over, half, of, all, divers, in, the, survey, had, experienced, panic, underwater, at, some, time, during, their, diving, career, and, these, findings, were, independently, corroborated, by, a, survey, that, suggested, 65, of, recreational, divers, have, panicked, under, water, panic, frequently, leads, to, errors, in, a, diver, s, judgement, or, performance, and, may, result, in, an, accident, the, safety, of, underwater, diving, operations, can, be, improved, by, reducing, the, frequency, of, human, error, and, the, consequences, when, it, does, occur, only, 4, 46, of, the, recreational, diving, fatalities, in, a, 1997, study, were, attributable, to, a, single, contributory, cause, the, remaining, fatalities, probably, arose, as, a, result, of, a, progressive, sequence, of, events, involving, two, or, more, procedural, errors, or, equipment, failures, and, since, procedural, errors, are, generally, avoidable, by, a, well, trained, intelligent, and, alert, diver, working, in, an, organised, structure, and, not, under, excessive, stress, it, was, concluded, that, the, low, accident, rate, in, professional, scuba, diving, is, due, to, this, factor, the, study, also, concluded, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, eliminate, all, minor, contraindications, of, scuba, diving, as, this, would, result, in, overwhelming, bureaucracy, and, bring, all, diving, to, a, halt, human, factors, in, diving, equipment, design, is, the, influence, of, the, interaction, between, the, diver, and, the, equipment, on, the, design, of, the, equipment, on, which, the, diver, relies, to, stay, alive, and, in, reasonable, comfort, and, to, perform, the, planned, tasks, during, a, dive, the, design, of, the, equipment, can, strongly, influence, its, effectiveness, in, performing, the, desired, functions, divers, vary, considerably, in, anthropometric, dimensions, physical, strength, joint, flexibility, and, other, physiological, characteristics, within, the, range, of, acceptable, fitness, to, dive, diving, equipment, should, allow, as, full, a, range, of, function, as, reasonably, practicable, and, should, be, matched, to, the, diver, the, environment, and, the, task, diving, support, equipment, is, usually, shared, by, a, wide, range, of, divers, and, must, work, for, them, all, the, most, difficult, stages, of, a, dive, for, recreational, divers, are, out, of, water, activities, and, transitions, between, water, and, the, surface, site, such, as, carrying, equipment, on, shore, exiting, from, water, to, boat, and, shore, surface, swimming, and, dressing, into, the, equipment, safety, and, reliability, adjustability, to, fit, the, individual, performance, and, simplicity, were, rated, the, most, important, features, for, diving, equipment, by, recreational, divers, the, professional, diver, is, supported, by, a, surface, team, who, are, available, to, assist, with, the, out, of, water, activities, to, the, extent, necessary, to, reduce, the, risk, associated, with, them, to, a, level, acceptable, in, terms, of, the, governing, regulations, and, codes, of, practice, risk, management, of, diving, operations, involves, the, usual, measures, of, engineering, controls, administrative, controls, and, procedures, and, personal, protective, equipment, including, hazard, identification, and, risk, assessment, hira, protective, equipment, medical, screening, training, and, standardised, procedures, professional, divers, are, generally, legally, obliged, to, carry, out, and, formally, record, these, measures, and, though, recreational, divers, are, not, legally, required, to, do, many, of, them, competent, recreational, divers, and, particularly, technical, divers, generally, perform, them, informally, but, routinely, and, they, are, an, important, part, of, technical, diver, training, for, example, a, medical,

following, the, guidelines, of, a, voluntary, membership, organisation, such, as, the, international, marine, contractors, association, imca, which, publishes, codes, of, accepted, best, practice, which, their, member, organisations, are, expected, to, follow, recreational, diver, training, and, dive, leading, are, industry, regulated, in, some, countries, and, only, directly, regulated, by,

accepted, though, non, specific, health, and, safety, legislation, still, applies, in, israel, recreational, diving, activities, are, regulated, by, the, recreational, diving, act, 1979, the, legal, responsibility, for, recreational, diving, service, providers, is, usually, limited, as, far, as, possible, by, waivers, which, they, require, the, customer, to, sign, before, engaging, in, any, diving, activity, the, extent, of, duty, of, care, of, recreational, buddy, divers, is, unclear, and, has, been, the, subject, of, considerable, litigation, it, is, probable, that, it, varies, between, jurisdictions, in, spite, of, this, lack, of, clarity, buddy, diving, is, recommended, by, recreational, diver, training, agencies, as, safer, than, solo, diving, and, some, service, providers, insist, that, customers, dive, in, buddy, pairs, scuba, diving, tourism, is, the, industry, based, on, servicing, the, requirements, of, recreational, divers, at, destinations, other, than,

satisfaction, is, largely, dependent, on, the, quality, of, services, provided, and, personal, communication, has, a, strong, influence, on, the, popularity, of, specific, service, providers, in, a, region, professional, diving, includes, a, wide, range, of, applications, of, varying, economic, impact, all, of, them, are, in, support, of, specific, sectors, of, industry, commerce, defence, or, public, service, and, their, economic, impacts, are, closely, related, to, their, importance, to, the, relevant, sector, and, their, effects, on, the, diving, equipment, manufacturing, and, support, industries, the, importance, of, diving, to, the, scientific, community, is, not, well, recorded, but, analysis, of, publications, shows, that, diving, supports, scientific, research, largely, through, efficient, and, targeted, sampling, most, modes, of, diving, are, equipment, intensive, and, much, of, the, equipment, is, either, life, support, or, specialised, equipment, for, the, application, this, has, led, to, a, manufacturing, industry, in, support, of, both, recreational, and, professional, diving, where, developments, in, one, mode, often, find, applications, in, another, in, terms, of, total, numbers, of, divers, the, recreational, diving, industry, has, a, far, larger, market, but, the, costs, of, equipment, and, relatively, large, manning, requirements, of, professional, diving, make, that, market, substantial, in, its, own, right, the, international, diving, equipment, and, marketing, association, dema, exists, to, promote, the, scuba, diving, and, snorkeling, industry, the, number, of, active, scuba, divers, is, not, recorded, systematically, but, has, been, estimated, on, occasions, with, varying, levels, of, confidence, one, of, the, problems, is, the, lack, of, a, generally, accepted, definition, of, what, constitutes, an, active, scuba, diver, the, situation, for, freedivers, and, snorkelers, is, even, less, clear, as, most, freedivers, have, no, qualification, registered, anywhere, the, diving, equipment, and, marketing, association, dema, estimate, from, 2, 5, to, 3, 5, million, active, scuba, divers, in, the, us, and, up, to, 6, million, worldwide, about, 11, million, snorkelers, in, the, us, and, about, 20, million, snorkelers, worldwide, the, sports, and, fitness, industry, association, sfia, reported, 2, 351,

be, fewer, than, 1, 000, 000, possibly, as, low, as, 500, 000, depending, on, the, definition, of, active, numbers, outside, the, us, are, less, clear, this, may, be, compared, with, padi, worldwide, statistics, for, 2021, in, which, they, claim, to, have, issued, more, than, 28, million, diver, certifications, since, 1967, entry, of, non, divers, through, certification, courses, also, provides, an, indicator, of, numbers, though, there, is, no, record, of, whether, a, diver, remains, active, after, certification, unless, further, training, is, registered, three, training, and, certification,

000, professional, members, instructors, and, divemasters, worldwide, in, 2019, on, the, assumption, that, padi, represents, 70, of, the, market, share, the, number, of, instructors, globally, may, be, about, 195, 000, the, american, academy, of, underwater, sciences, aaus, reports, 4, 500, divers, at, 150, organisational, member, scientific, diving, programmes, 2020, and, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, and, bureau, of, labor, statistics, reported, 3, 380, commercial, divers, in, the, us, 2018, the, number, of, active, public, safety, divers, in, the, us, is, also, uncertain, but, estimated, to, be, between, 3, 000, and, 5, 000, in, 2019, the, environmental, impact, of, recreational, diving, is, the, effects, of, diving, tourism, on, the, marine, environment, usually, these, are, considered, to, be, adverse, effects, and, include, damage, to, reef, organisms, by, incompetent, and, ignorant, divers, but, there, may, also, be, positive, effects, as, the, environment, is, recognised, by, the, local, communities, to, be, worth, more, in, good, condition, than, degraded, by, inappropriate, use, which, encourages, conservation, efforts, during, the, 20th, century, recreational, scuba, diving, was, considered, to, have, generally, low, environmental, impact, and, was, consequently, one, of, the, activities, permitted, in, most, marine, protected, areas, since, the, 1970s, diving, has, changed, from, an, elite, activity, to, a, more, accessible, recreation, marketed, to, a, very, wide, demographic, to, some, extent, better, equipment, has, been, substituted, for, more, rigorous, training, and, the, reduction, in, perceived, risk, has, shortened, minimum, training, requirements, by, several, training, agencies, training, has, concentrated, on, an, acceptable, risk, to, the, diver, and, paid, less, attention, to, the, environment, the, increase, in, the, popularity, of, diving, and, in, tourist, access, to, sensitive, ecological, systems, has, led, to, the, recognition, that, the, activity, can, have, significant, environmental, consequences, recreational, scuba, diving, has, grown, in, popularity, during, the, 21st, century, as, is, shown, by, the, number, of, certifications, issued, worldwide, which, has, increased, to, about, 23, million, by, 2016, at, about, one, million, per, year, scuba, diving, tourism, is, a, growth, industry, and, it, is, necessary, to, consider, environmental, sustainability, as, the, expanding, impact, of, divers, can, adversely, affect, the, marine, environment, in, several, ways, and, the, impact, also, depends, on, the, specific, environment, tropical, coral, reefs, are, more, easily, damaged, by, poor, diving, skills, than, some, temperate, reefs, where, the, environment, is, more, robust, due, to, rougher, sea, conditions, and, fewer, fragile, slow, growing, organisms, the, same, pleasant, sea, conditions, that, allow, development, of, relatively, delicate, and, highly, diverse, ecologies, also, attract, the, greatest, number, of, tourists, including, divers, who, dive, infrequently, exclusively, on, vacation, and, never, fully, develop, the, skills, to, dive, in, an, environmentally, friendly, way, low, impact, diving, training, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, reducing, diver, contact, the, ecological, impact, of, commercial, diving, is, a, small, part, of, the, impact, of, the, specific, industry, supported, by, the, diving, operations, as, commercial, diving, is, not, done, in, isolation, in, most, cases, the, impact, of, diving, operations, is, insignificant, in, comparison, with, the, overall, project, and, environmental, impact, assessments, may, be, required, before, the, project, is, authorised, for, some, classes, of, project, underwater, ships, husbandry, may, be, an, exception, to, this, general, tendency, and, specific, precautions, to, limit, ecological, impact, may, be, required, several, of, these, operations, will, release, some, quantity, of, harmful, material, into, the, water, particularly, hull, cleaning, operations, which, will, release, antifouling, toxins, alien, biofouling, organisms, may, also, be, released, during, this, process, 15, other, forms, of, professional, diving, such, as, scientific, and, archaeological, dives, are, planned, to, minimise, impact, which, may, be, a, condition, for, the, application, for, a, permit
