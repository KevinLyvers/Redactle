beer, is, an, alcoholic, beverage, produced, by, the, brewing, and, fermentation, of, starches, from, cereal, grains, most, commonly, malted, barley, although, wheat, maize, corn, rice, and, oats, are, also, used, the, fermentation, of, the, starch, sugars, in, the, wort, produces, ethanol, and, carbonation, in, the, beer, beer, is, one, of, the, oldest, alcoholic, drinks, in, the, world, the, most, widely, consumed, and, the, third, most, popular, drink, after, water, and, tea, p, 1, most, modern, beer, is, brewed, with, hops, which, add, bitterness, and, other, flavours, and, act, as, a, natural, preservative, and, stabilising, agent, other, flavouring, agents, such, as, gruit, herbs, or, fruits, may, be, included, or, used, instead, of, hops, in, commercial, brewing, natural, carbonation, is, often, replaced, with, forced, carbonation, some, of, the, earliest, writings, refer, to, the, production, and, distribution, of, beer, the, code, of, hammurabi, included, laws, regulating, it, and, the, hymn, to, ninkasi, a, prayer, to, the, mesopotamian, goddess, of, beer, a, recipe, for, it, beer, is, distributed, in, bottles, and, cans, and, is, also, commonly, available, on, draught, particularly, in, pubs, and, bars, the, brewing, industry, is, a, global, business, consisting, of, several, dominant, multinational, companies, and, many, thousands, of, smaller, producers, ranging, from, brewpubs, to, regional, breweries, the, strength, of, modern, beer, is, usually, around, 4, to, 6, alcohol, by, volume, abv, beer, forms, part, of, the, culture, of, many, nations, and, is, associated, with, social, traditions, such, as, beer, festivals, as, well, as, activities, like, pub, crawling, pub, quizzes, and, pub, games, in, early, forms, of, english, and, in, the, scandinavian, languages, the, usual, word, for, beer, was, the, word, whose, modern, english, form, is, ale, the, modern, word, beer, comes, into, present, day, english, from, old, english, b, or, itself, from, common, germanic, it, is, found, throughout, the, west, germanic, and, north, germanic, dialects, modern, dutch, and, german, bier, old, norse, bj, rr, the, earlier, etymology, of, the, word, is, debated, the, three, main, theories, are, that, the, word, originates, in, proto, germanic, beuz, putatively, from, proto, indo, european, b, eus, m, meaning, brewer, s, yeast, beer, dregs, that, it, is, related, to, the, word, barley, or, that, it, was, somehow, borrowed, from, latin, bibere, to, drink, it, is, speculated, by, christine, fell, in, leeds, studies, in, english, 1975, that, the, old, english, norse, word, b, or, did, not, denote, ale, or, beer, but, a, strong, sweet, drink, rather, like, mead, or, cider, however, in, europe, the, meaning, of, b, or, expanded, to, cover, the, meaning, of, ale, when, hopped, ale, from, europe, was, imported, into, britain, in, the, late, middle, ages, using, the, word, beer, it, was, originally, used, to, denote, hopped, ale, to, differentiate, from, the, british, unhopped, ale, though, later, it, came, to, mean, all, forms, of, beer, beer, is, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, prepared, alcoholic, drinks, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, fermentation, consists, of, 13, 000, year, old, residues, of, a, beer, with, the, consistency, of, gruel, used, by, the, semi, nomadic, natufians, for, ritual, feasting, at, the, raqefet, cave, in, the, carmel, mountains, near, haifa, in, israel, there, is, evidence, that, beer, was, produced, at, g, bekli, tepe, during, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, around, 8500, bc, to, 5500, bc, the, earliest, clear, chemical, evidence, of, beer, produced, from, barley, dates, to, about, 3500, 3100, bc, from, the, site, of, godin, tepe, in, the, zagros, mountains, of, western, iran, it, is, possible, but, not, proven, that, it, dates, back, even, further, to, about, 10, 000, bc, when, cereal, was, first, farmed, beer, is, recorded, in, the, written, history, of, ancient, egypt, and, archaeologists, speculate, that, beer, was, instrumental, in, the, formation, of, civilizations, approximately, 5000, years, ago, workers, in, the, city, of, uruk, modern, day, iraq, were, paid, by, their, employers, with, volumes, of, beer, during, the, building, of, the, great, pyramids, in, giza, egypt, each, worker, got, a, daily, ration, of, four, to, five, litres, of, beer, which, served, as, both, nutrition, and, refreshment, and, was, crucial, to, the, pyramids, construction, some, of, the, earliest, sumerian, writings, contain, references, to, beer, examples, include, a, prayer, to, the, goddess, ninkasi, known, as, the, hymn, to, ninkasi, which, served, as, both, a, prayer, and, a, method, of, remembering, the, recipe, for, beer, in, a, culture, with, few, literate, people, and, the, ancient, advice, fill, your, belly, day, and, night, make, merry, to, gilgamesh, recorded, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, by, the, alewife, siduri, may, at, least, in, part, have, referred, to, the, consumption, of, beer, the, ebla, tablets, discovered, in, 1974, in, ebla, syria, show, that, beer, was, produced, in, the, city, in, 2500, bc, a, fermented, drink, using, rice, and, fruit, was, made, in, china, around, 7000, bc, unlike, sake, mould, was, not, used, to, saccharify, the, rice, amylolytic, fermentation, the, rice, was, probably, prepared, for, fermentation, by, chewing, or, malting, during, the, vedic, period, in, ancient, india, there, are, records, of, the, consumption, of, the, beer, like, sura, xenophon, noted, that, during, his, travels, beer, was, being, produced, in, armenia, almost, any, substance, containing, sugar, can, naturally, undergo, alcoholic, fermentation, and, thus, be, utilised, in, the, brewing, of, beer, it, is, likely, that, many, cultures, on, observing, that, a, sweet, liquid, could, be, obtained, from, a, source, of, starch, independently, invented, beer, bread, and, beer, increased, prosperity, to, a, level, that, allowed, time, for, the, development, of, other, technologies, and, contributed, to, the, building, of, civilizations, beer, was, spread, through, europe, by, germanic, and, celtic, tribes, as, far, back, as, 3000, bc, and, it, was, mainly, brewed, on, a, domestic, scale, artc, 1025, the, product, that, the, early, europeans, drank, might, not, be, recognised, as, beer, by, most, people, today, alongside, the, basic, starch, source, the, early, european, beers, may, have, contained, fruits, honey, numerous, types, of, plants, spices, and, other, substances, such, as, narcotic, herbs, p, 2, what, they, did, not, contain, was, hops, as, that, was, a, later, addition, first, mentioned, in, europe, around, 822, by, a, carolingian, abbot, and, again, in, 1067, by, abbess, hildegard, of, bingen, p, 110, in, 1516, william, iv, duke, of, bavaria, adopted, the, reinheitsgebot, purity, law, perhaps, the, oldest, food, quality, regulation, still, in, use, in, the, 21st, century, according, to, which, the, only, allowed, ingredients, of, beer, are, water, hops, and, barley, malt, beer, produced, before, the, industrial, revolution, continued, to, be, made, and, sold, on, a, domestic, scale, although, by, the, 7th, century, ad, beer, was, also, being, produced, and, sold, by, european, monasteries, during, the, industrial, revolution, the, production, of, beer, moved, from, artisanal, manufacture, to, industrial, manufacture, and, domestic, manufacture, ceased, to, be, significant, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, development, of, hydrometers, and, thermometers, changed, brewing, by, allowing, the, brewer, more, control, of, the, process, and, greater, knowledge, of, the, results, in, 1912, brown, bottles, began, to, be, used, by, the, joseph, schlitz, brewing, company, of, milwaukee, wisconsin, in, the, united, states, this, innovation, has, since, been, accepted, worldwide, as, it, prevents, light, rays, from, degrading, the, quality, and, stability, of, beer, the, brewing, industry, is, now, a, global, business, consisting, of, several, dominant, multinational, companies, and, many, thousands, of, smaller, producers, ranging, from, brewpubs, to, regional, breweries, as, of, 2006, more, than, 133, billion, litres, 35, billion, us, gallons, the, equivalent, of, a, cube, 510, metres, on, a, side, of, beer, are, sold, per, year, producing, total, global, revenues, of, us, 294, 5, billion, in, 2010, china, s, beer, consumption, hit, 450, million, hectolitres, 45, billion, litres, or, nearly, twice, that, of, the, united, states, but, only, 5, per, cent, sold, were, premium, beers, compared, with, 50, per, cent, in, france, and, germany, a, widely, publicised, study, in, 2018, suggested, that, sudden, decreases, in, barley, production, due, to, extreme, drought, and, heat, could, in, the, future, cause, substantial, volatility, in, the, availability, and, price, of, beer, the, process, of, making, beer, is, known, as, brewing, a, dedicated, building, for, the, making, of, beer, is, called, a, brewery, though, beer, can, be, made, at, home, and, has, been, for, much, of, its, history, in, which, case, the, brewing, location, is, often, called, a, brewhouse, a, company, that, makes, beer, is, called, either, a, brewery, or, a, brewing, company, beer, made, on, a, domestic, scale, for, non, commercial, reasons, is, today, usually, classified, as, homebrewing, regardless, of, where, it, is, made, though, most, homebrewed, beer, is, made, at, home, historically, domestic, beer, was, what, s, called, farmhouse, ale, brewing, beer, has, been, subject, to, legislation, and, taxation, for, millennia, and, from, the, late, 19th, century, on, taxation, largely, restricted, brewing, to, commercial, operations, only, in, the, uk, however, the, uk, government, relaxed, legislation, in, 1963, followed, by, australia, in, 1972, and, the, us, in, 1978, though, individual, states, were, allowed, to, pass, their, own, laws, limiting, production, allowing, homebrewing, to, become, a, popular, hobby, the, purpose, of, brewing, is, to, convert, the, starch, source, into, a, sugary, liquid, called, wort, and, to, convert, the, wort, into, the, alcoholic, drink, known, as, beer, in, a, fermentation, process, effected, by, yeast, the, first, step, where, the, wort, is, prepared, by, mixing, the, starch, source, normally, malted, barley, with, hot, water, is, known, as, mashing, hot, water, known, as, liquor, in, brewing, terms, is, mixed, with, crushed, malt, or, malts, known, as, grist, in, a, mash, tun, the, mashing, process, takes, around, 1, to, 2, hours, during, which, the, starches, are, converted, to, sugars, and, then, the, sweet, wort, is, drained, off, the, grains, the, grains, are, then, washed, in, a, process, known, as, sparging, this, washing, allows, the, brewer, to, gather, as, much, of, the, fermentable, liquid, from, the, grains, as, possible, the, process, of, filtering, the, spent, grain, from, the, wort, and, sparge, water, is, called, wort, separation, the, traditional, process, for, wort, separation, is, lautering, in, which, the, grain, bed, itself, serves, as, the, filter, medium, some, modern, breweries, prefer, the, use, of, filter, frames, which, allow, for, a, more, finely, ground, grist, most, modern, breweries, use, a, continuous, sparge, collecting, the, original, wort, and, the, sparge, water, together, however, it, is, possible, to, collect, a, second, or, even, third, wash, with, the, not, quite, spent, grains, as, separate, batches, each, run, would, produce, a, weaker, wort, and, thus, a, weaker, beer, this, process, is, known, as, the, second, and, third, runnings, brewing, with, several, runnings, is, called, parti, gyle, brewing, the, sweet, wort, collected, from, sparging, is, put, into, a, kettle, or, copper, so, called, because, these, vessels, were, traditionally, made, from, copper, and, boiled, usually, for, about, one, hour, during, boiling, the, water, in, the, wort, evaporates, but, the, sugars, and, other, components, of, the, wort, remain, this, allows, more, efficient, use, of, the, starch, sources, in, the, beer, boiling, also, destroys, any, remaining, enzymes, left, over, from, the, mashing, stage, hops, are, added, during, boiling, as, a, source, of, bitterness, flavour, and, aroma, hops, may, be, added, at, more, than, one, point, during, the, boil, the, longer, the, hops, are, boiled, the, more, bitterness, they, contribute, but, the, less, hop, flavour, and, aroma, remain, in, the, beer, after, boiling, the, hopped, wort, is, cooled, and, ready, for, the, yeast, in, some, breweries, the, hopped, wort, may, pass, through, a, hopback, which, is, a, small, vat, filled, with, hops, to, add, aromatic, hop, flavouring, and, to, act, as, a, filter, but, usually, the, hopped, wort, is, simply, cooled, for, the, fermenter, where, the, yeast, is, added, during, fermentation, the, wort, becomes, beer, in, a, process, that, takes, a, week, to, several, months, depending, on, the, type, of, yeast, and, strength, of, the, beer, in, addition, to, producing, ethanol, fine, particulate, matter, suspended, in, the, wort, settles, during, fermentation, once, fermentation, is, complete, the, yeast, also, settles, leaving, the, beer, clear, during, fermentation, most, of, the, carbon, dioxide, is, allowed, to, escape, through, a, trap, and, the, beer, is, left, with, carbonation, of, only, about, one, atmosphere, of, pressure, the, carbonation, is, often, increased, either, by, transferring, the, beer, to, a, pressure, vessel, such, as, a, keg, and, introducing, pressurised, carbon, dioxide, or, by, transferring, it, before, the, fermentation, is, finished, so, that, carbon, dioxide, pressure, builds, up, inside, the, container, as, the, fermentation, finishes, sometimes, the, beer, is, put, unfiltered, so, it, still, contains, yeast, into, bottles, with, some, added, sugar, which, then, produces, the, desired, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, inside, the, bottle, fermentation, is, sometimes, carried, out, in, two, stages, primary, and, secondary, once, most, of, the, alcohol, has, been, produced, during, primary, fermentation, the, beer, is, transferred, to, a, new, vessel, and, allowed, a, period, of, secondary, fermentation, secondary, fermentation, is, used, when, the, beer, requires, long, storage, before, packaging, or, greater, clarity, when, the, beer, has, fermented, it, is, packaged, either, into, casks, for, cask, ale, or, kegs, aluminium, cans, or, bottles, for, other, sorts, of, beer, the, basic, ingredients, of, beer, are, water, a, starch, source, such, as, malted, barley, or, malted, maize, such, as, used, in, the, preparation, of, tiswin, and, tesg, ino, able, to, be, saccharified, converted, to, sugars, and, then, fermented, converted, into, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, a, brewer, s, yeast, to, produce, the, fermentation, and, a, flavouring, such, as, hops, a, mixture, of, starch, sources, may, be, used, with, a, secondary, carbohydrate, source, such, as, maize, corn, rice, wheat, or, sugar, often, termed, an, adjunct, especially, when, used, alongside, malted, barley, less, widely, used, starch, sources, include, millet, sorghum, and, cassava, root, in, africa, potato, in, brazil, and, agave, in, mexico, among, others, the, amount, of, each, starch, source, in, a, beer, recipe, is, collectively, called, the, grain, bill, water, is, the, main, ingredient, in, beer, accounting, for, 93, of, its, weight, though, water, itself, is, ideally, flavourless, its, level, of, dissolved, minerals, specifically, bicarbonate, ions, does, influence, beer, s, finished, taste, due, to, the, mineral, properties, of, each, region, s, water, specific, areas, were, originally, the, sole, producers, of, certain, types, of, beer, each, identifiable, by, regional, characteristics, regional, geology, accords, that, dublin, s, hard, water, is, well, suited, to, making, stout, such, as, guinness, while, the, plze, region, s, soft, water, is, ideal, for, brewing, pilsner, pale, lager, such, as, pilsner, urquell, the, waters, of, burton, in, england, contain, gypsum, which, benefits, making, pale, ale, to, such, a, degree, that, brewers, of, pale, ales, will, add, gypsum, to, the, local, water, in, a, process, known, as, burtonisation, the, starch, source, termed, the, mash, ingredients, in, a, beer, provides, the, fermentable, material, and, is, a, key, determinant, of, the, strength, and, flavour, of, the, beer, the, most, common, starch, source, used, in, beer, is, malted, grain, grain, is, malted, by, soaking, it, in, water, allowing, it, to, begin, germination, and, then, drying, the, partially, germinated, grain, in, a, kiln, malting, grain, produces, enzymes, that, convert, starches, in, the, grain, into, fermentable, sugars, different, roasting, times, and, temperatures, are, used, to, produce, different, colours, of, malt, from, the, same, grain, darker, malts, will, produce, darker, beers, nearly, all, beers, include, barley, malt, as, the, majority, of, the, starch, this, is, because, its, fibrous, hull, remains, attached, to, the, grain, during, threshing, after, malting, barley, is, milled, which, finally, removes, the, hull, breaking, it, into, large, pieces, these, pieces, remain, with, the, grain, during, the, mash, and, act, as, a, filter, bed, during, lautering, when, sweet, wort, is, separated, from, insoluble, grain, material, other, malted, and, unmalted, grains, including, wheat, rice, oats, and, rye, and, less, frequently, corn, and, sorghum, may, be, used, some, brewers, have, produced, gluten, free, beer, made, with, sorghum, with, no, barley, malt, for, those, who, cannot, consume, gluten, containing, grains, like, wheat, barley, and, rye, flavouring, beer, is, the, sole, major, commercial, use, of, hops, the, flower, of, the, hop, vine, is, used, as, a, flavouring, and, preservative, agent, in, nearly, all, beer, made, today, the, flowers, themselves, are, often, called, hops, the, first, historical, mention, of, the, use, of, hops, in, beer, dates, from, 822, ad, in, monastery, rules, written, by, adalhard, the, elder, also, known, as, adalard, of, corbie, though, the, date, normally, given, for, widespread, cultivation, of, hops, for, use, in, beer, is, the, thirteenth, century, before, the, thirteenth, century, and, until, the, sixteenth, century, during, which, hops, took, over, as, the, dominant, flavouring, beer, was, flavoured, with, other, plants, for, instance, grains, of, paradise, or, alehoof, combinations, of, various, aromatic, herbs, berries, and, even, ingredients, like, wormwood, would, be, combined, into, a, mixture, known, as, gruit, and, used, as, hops, are, now, used, some, beers, today, such, as, fraoch, by, the, scottish, heather, ales, company, and, cervoise, lancelot, by, the, french, brasserie, lancelot, company, use, plants, other, than, hops, for, flavouring, hops, contain, several, characteristics, that, brewers, desire, in, beer, hops, contribute, a, bitterness, that, balances, the, sweetness, of, the, malt, the, bitterness, of, beers, is, measured, on, the, international, bitterness, units, scale, hops, contribute, floral, citrus, and, herbal, aromas, and, flavours, to, beer, hops, have, an, antibiotic, effect, that, favours, the, activity, of, brewer, s, yeast, over, less, desirable, microorganisms, and, aids, in, head, retention, the, length, of, time, that, a, foamy, head, created, by, carbonation, will, last, the, acidity, of, hops, is, a, preservative, yeast, is, the, microorganism, that, is, responsible, for, fermentation, in, beer, yeast, metabolises, the, sugars, extracted, from, grains, which, produce, alcohol, and, carbon, dioxide, and, thereby, turns, wort, into, beer, in, addition, to, fermenting, the, beer, yeast, influences, the, character, and, flavour, the, dominant, types, of, yeast, used, to, make, beer, are, top, fermenting, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, bottom, fermenting, saccharomyces, pastorianus, brettanomyces, ferments, lambics, and, torulaspora, delbrueckii, ferments, bavarian, weissbier, before, the, role, of, yeast, in, fermentation, was, understood, fermentation, involved, wild, or, airborne, yeasts, a, few, styles, such, as, lambics, rely, on, this, method, today, but, most, modern, fermentation, adds, pure, yeast, cultures, some, brewers, add, one, or, more, clarifying, agents, or, finings, to, beer, which, typically, precipitate, collect, as, a, solid, out, of, the, beer, along, with, protein, solids, and, are, found, only, in, trace, amounts, in, the, finished, product, this, process, makes, the, beer, appear, bright, and, clean, rather, than, the, cloudy, appearance, of, ethnic, and, older, styles, of, beer, such, as, wheat, beers, examples, of, clarifying, agents, include, isinglass, obtained, from, the, swimbladders, of, fish, irish, moss, a, seaweed, kappa, carrageenan, from, the, seaweed, kappaphycus, cottonii, polyclar, artificial, and, gelatin, if, a, beer, is, marked, suitable, for, vegans, it, is, clarified, either, with, seaweed, or, with, artificial, agents, the, history, of, breweries, in, the, 21st, century, has, included, larger, breweries, absorbing, smaller, breweries, in, order, to, ensure, economy, of, scale, in, 2002, south, african, breweries, bought, the, north, american, miller, brewing, company, to, found, sabmiller, becoming, the, second, largest, brewery, after, north, american, anheuser, busch, in, 2004, the, belgian, interbrew, was, the, third, largest, brewery, by, volume, and, the, brazilian, ambev, was, the, fifth, largest, they, merged, into, inbev, becoming, the, largest, brewery, in, 2007, sabmiller, surpassed, inbev, and, anheuser, busch, when, it, acquired, royal, grolsch, the, brewer, of, dutch, brand, grolsch, in, 2008, when, inbev, the, second, largest, bought, anheuser, busch, the, third, largest, the, new, anheuser, busch, inbev, company, became, again, the, largest, brewer, in, the, world, as, of, 2020, according, to, the, market, research, firm, technavio, ab, inbev, remains, the, largest, brewing, company, in, the, world, with, heineken, second, cr, snow, third, carlsberg, fourth, and, molson, coors, fifth, a, microbrewery, or, craft, brewery, produces, a, limited, amount, of, beer, the, maximum, amount, of, beer, a, brewery, can, produce, and, still, be, classed, as, a, microbrewery, varies, by, region, and, by, authority, in, the, us, it, is, 15, 000, us, beer, barrels, 1, 8, megalitres, 390, thousand, imperial, gallons, 460, thousand, us, gallons, a, year, a, brewpub, is, a, type, of, microbrewery, that, incorporates, a, pub, or, other, drinking, establishment, the, highest, density, of, breweries, in, the, world, most, of, them, microbreweries, exists, in, franconia, germany, especially, in, the, district, of, upper, franconia, which, has, about, 200, breweries, the, benedictine, weihenstephan, brewery, in, bavaria, germany, can, trace, its, roots, to, the, year, 768, as, a, document, from, that, year, refers, to, a, hop, garden, in, the, area, paying, a, tithe, to, the, monastery, the, brewery, was, licensed, by, the, city, of, freising, in, 1040, and, is, therefore, the, oldest, working, brewery, in, the, world, while, there, are, many, types, of, beer, brewed, the, basics, of, brewing, beer, are, shared, across, national, and, cultural, boundaries, the, traditional, european, brewing, regions, germany, belgium, england, and, the, czech, republic, have, local, varieties, of, beer, english, writer, michael, jackson, in, his, 1977, book, the, world, guide, to, beer, categorised, beers, from, around, the, world, in, local, style, groups, suggested, by, local, customs, and, names, fred, eckhardt, furthered, jackson, s, work, in, the, essentials, of, beer, style, in, 1989, top, fermented, beers, are, most, commonly, produced, with, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, a, top, fermenting, yeast, which, clumps, and, rises, to, the, surface, typically, between, 15, and, 25, c, 59, and, 77, f, at, these, temperatures, yeast, produces, significant, amounts, of, esters, and, other, secondary, flavour, and, aroma, products, and, the, result, is, often, a, beer, with, slightly, fruity, compounds, resembling, apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or, prune, among, others, after, the, introduction, of, hops, into, england, from, flanders, in, the, 15th, century, ale, referred, to, an, unhopped, fermented, drink, beer, being, used, to, describe, a, brew, with, an, infusion, of, hops, real, ale, is, the, term, coined, by, the, campaign, for, real, ale, camra, in, 1973, for, beer, brewed, from, traditional, ingredients, matured, by, secondary, fermentation, in, the, container, from, which, it, is, dispensed, and, served, without, the, use, of, extraneous, carbon, dioxide, it, is, applied, to, bottle, conditioned, and, cask, conditioned, beers, pale, ale, is, a, beer, which, uses, a, top,

usually, dark, coloured, with, an, abv, of, 3, to, 3, 6, although, there, are, lighter, hued, milds, as, well, as, stronger, examples, reaching, 6, abv, and, higher, wheat, beer, is, brewed, with, a, large, proportion, of, wheat, although, it, often, also, contains, a, significant, proportion, of, malted, barley, wheat, beers, are, usually, top, fermented, the, flavour, of, wheat, beers, varies, considerably, depending, upon, the, specific, style, stout, is, a, dark, beer, made, using, roasted, barley, and, typically, brewed, with, slow, fermenting, yeast, there, are, a, number, of, variations, including, dry, stout, such, as, guinness, sweet, stout, and, imperial, or, russian, stout, stout, was, originally, the, strongest, variety, of, porter, a, dark, brown, beer, popular, with, the, street, and, river, porters, of, eighteenth, century, london, lager, is, cool, fermented, beer, pale, lagers, are, the, most, commonly, consumed, beers, in, the, world, many, are, of, the, pilsner, type, the, name, lager, comes, from, the, german, lagern, for, to, store, as, brewers, around, bavaria, stored, beer, in, cool, cellars, and, caves, during, the, warm, summer, months, these, brewers, noticed, that, the, beers, continued, to, ferment, and, to, also, clear, of, sediment, when, stored, in, cool, conditions, lager, yeast, is, a, cool, bottom, fermenting, yeast, saccharomyces, pastorianus, and, typically, undergoes, primary, fermentation, at, 7, 12, c, 45, 54, f, the, fermentation, phase, and, then, is, given, a, long, secondary, fermentation, at, 0, 4, c, 32, 39, f, the, lagering, phase, during, the, secondary, stage, the, lager, clears, and, mellows, the, cooler, conditions, also, inhibit, the, natural, production, of, esters, and, other, byproducts, resulting, in, a, cleaner, tasting, beer, with, improved, modern, yeast, strains, most, lager, breweries, use, only, short, periods, of, cold, storage, typically, 1, 3, weeks, lambic, a, beer, of, belgium, is, naturally, fermented, using, wild, yeasts, rather, than, cultivated, many, of, these, are, not, strains, of, brewer, s, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, may, have, significant, differences, in, aroma, and, sourness, yeast, varieties, such, as, brettanomyces, bruxellensis, and, brettanomyces, lambicus, are, common, in, lambics, in, addition, other, organisms, such, as, lactobacillus, bacteria, produce, acids, which, contribute, to, the, sourness, beer, is, measured, and, assessed, by, colour, by, strength, and, by, bitterness, the, perceived, bitterness, is, measured, by, the, international, bitterness, units, scale, ibu, defined, in, co, operation, between, the, american, society, of, brewing, chemists, and, the, european, brewery, convention, the, international, scale, was, a, development, of, the, european, bitterness, units, scale, often, abbreviated, as, ebu, and, the, bitterness, values, should, be, identical, beer, colour, is, determined, by, the, malt, the, most, common, colour, is, a, pale, amber, produced, from, using, pale, malts, pale, lager, and, pale, ale, are, terms, used, for, beers, made, from, malt, dried, and, roasted, with, the, fuel, coke, coke, was, first, used, for, roasting, malt, in, 1642, but, it, was, not, until, around, 1703, that, the, term, pale, ale, was, used, in, terms, of, sales, volume, most, of, today, s, beer, is, based, on, the, pale, lager, brewed, in, 1842, in, the, town, of, pilsen, in, the, present, day, czech, republic, the, modern, pale, lager, is, light, in, colour, due, to, use, of, coke, for, kilning, which, gives, off, heat, with, little, smoke, dark, beers, are, usually, brewed, from, a, pale, malt, or, lager, malt, base, with, a, small, proportion, of, darker, malt, added, to, achieve, the, desired, shade, other, colourants, such, as, caramel, are, also, widely, used, to, darken, beers, very, dark, beers, such, as, stout, use, dark, or, patent, malts, that, have, been, roasted, longer, some, have, roasted, unmalted, barley, beer, ranges, from, less, than, 3, alcohol, by, volume, abv, to, around, 14, abv, though, this, strength, can, be, increased, to, around, 20, by, re, pitching, with, champagne, yeast, and, to, 55, abv, by, the, freeze, distilling, process, the, alcohol, content, of, beer, varies, by, local, practice, or, beer, style, the, pale, lagers, that, most, consumers, are, familiar, with, fall, in, the, range, of, 4, 6, with, a, typical, abv, of, 5, the, customary, strength, of, british, ales, is, quite, low, with, many, session, beers, being, around, 4, abv, in, belgium, some, beers, such, as, table, beer, are, of, such, low, alcohol, content, 1, 4, that, they, are, served, instead, of, soft, drinks, in, some, schools, the, weakest, beers, are, dealcoholized, beers, which, typically, have, less, than, 0, 05, alcohol, also, called, near, beer, and, light, beers, which, usually, have, 4, alcohol, the, alcohol, in, beer, comes, primarily, from, the, metabolism, of, sugars, that, are, produced, during, fermentation, the, quantity, of, fermentable, sugars, in, the, wort, and, the, variety, of, yeast, used, to, ferment, the, wort, are, the, primary, factors, that, determine, the, amount, of, alcohol, in, the, final, beer, additional, fermentable, sugars, are, sometimes, added, to, increase, alcohol, content, and, enzymes, are, often, added, to, the, wort, for, certain, styles, of, beer, primarily, light, beers, to, convert, more, complex, carbohydrates, starches, to, fermentable, sugars, alcohol, is, a, by, product, of, yeast, metabolism, and, is, toxic, to, the, yeast, in, higher, concentrations, typical, brewing, yeast, cannot, survive, at, alcohol, concentrations, above, 12, by, volume, low, temperatures, and, too, little, fermentation, time, decreases, the, effectiveness, of, yeasts, and, consequently, decreases, the, alcohol, content, the, strength, of, beers, has, climbed, during, the, later, years, of, the, 20th, century, vetter, 33, a, 10, 5, abv, 33, degrees, plato, hence, vetter, 33, doppelbock, was, listed, in, the, 1994, guinness, book, of, world, records, as, the, strongest, beer, at, that, time, though, samichlaus, by, the, swiss, brewer, h, rlimann, had, also, been, listed, by, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, as, the, strongest, at, 14, abv, since, then, some, brewers, have, used, champagne, yeasts, to, increase, the, alcohol, content, of, their, beers, samuel, adams, reached, 20, abv, with, millennium, and, then, surpassed, that, amount, to, 25, 6, abv, with, utopias, the, strongest, beer, brewed, in, britain, was, baz, s, super, brew, by, parish, brewery, a, 23, abv, beer, in, september, 2011, the, scottish, brewery, brewdog, produced, ghost, deer, which, at, 28, they, claim, to, be, the, world, s, strongest, beer, produced, by, fermentation, alone, the, product, claimed, to, be, the, strongest, beer, made, is, schorschbr, u, s, 2011, schorschbock, 57, with, 57, 5, it, was, preceded, by, the, end, of, history, a, 55, belgian, ale, made, by, brewdog, in, 2010, the, same, company, had, previously, made, sink, the, bismarck, a, 41, abv, ipa, and, tactical, nuclear, penguin, a, 32, abv, imperial, stout, each, of, these, beers, are, made, using, the, eisbock, method, of, fractional, freezing, in, which, a, strong, ale, is, partially, frozen, and, the, ice, is, repeatedly, removed, until, the, desired, strength, is, reached, a, process, that, may, class, the, product, as, spirits, rather, than, beer, the, german, brewery, schorschbr, u, s, schorschbock, a, 31, abv, eisbock, and, hair, of, the, dog, s, dave, a, 29, abv, barley, wine, made, in, 1994, used, the, same, fractional, freezing, method, a, 60, abv, blend, of, beer, with, whiskey, was, jokingly, claimed, as, the, strongest, beer, by, a, dutch, brewery, in, july, 2010, draught, also, spelled, draft, beer, from, a, pressurised, keg, using, a, lever, style, dispenser, and, a, spout, is, the, most, common, method, of, dispensing, in, bars, around, the, world, a, metal, keg, is, pressurised, with, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, gas, which, drives, the, beer, to, the, dispensing, tap, or, faucet, some, beers, may, be, served, with, a, nitrogen, carbon, dioxide, mixture, nitrogen, produces, fine, bubbles, resulting, in, a, dense, head, and, a, creamy, mouthfeel, some, types, of, beer, can, also, be, found, in, smaller, disposable, kegs, called, beer, balls, in, traditional, pubs, the, pull, levers, for, major, beer, brands, may, include, the, beer, s, logo, and, trademark, in, the, 1980s, guinness, introduced, the, beer, widget, a, nitrogen, pressurised, ball, inside, a, can, which, creates, a, dense, tight, head, similar, to, beer, served, from, a, nitrogen, system, the, words, draft, and, draught, can, be, used, as, marketing, terms, to, describe, canned, or, bottled, beers, containing, a, beer, widget, or, which, are, cold, filtered, rather, than, pasteurised, cask, conditioned, ales, or, cask, ales, are, unfiltered, and, unpasteurised, beers, these, beers, are, termed, real, ale, by, the, camra, organisation, typically, when, a, cask, arrives, in, a, pub, it, is, placed, horizontally, on, a, frame, called, a, stillage, which, is, designed, to, hold, it, steady, and, at, the, right, angle, and, then, allowed, to, cool, to, cellar, temperature, typically, between, 11, 13, c, or, 52, 55, f, before, being, tapped, and, vented, a, tap, is, driven, through, a, usually, rubber, bung, at, the, bottom, of, one, end, and, a, hard, spile, or, other, implement, is, used, to, open, a, hole, in, the, side, of, the, cask, which, is, now, uppermost, the, act, of, stillaging, and, then, venting, a, beer, in, this, manner, typically, disturbs, all, the, sediment, so, it, must, be, left, for, a, suitable, period, to, drop, clear, again, as, well, as, to, fully, condition, this, period, can, take, anywhere, from, several, hours, to, several, days, at, this, point, the, beer, is, ready, to, sell, either, being, pulled, through, a, beer, line, with, a, hand, pump, or, simply, being, gravity, fed, directly, into, the, glass, draught, beer, s, environmental, impact, can, be, 68, lower, than, bottled, beer, due, to, packaging, differences, a, life, cycle, study, of, one, beer, brand, including, grain, production, brewing, bottling, distribution, and, waste, management, shows, that, the, co, 2, emissions, from, a, 6, pack, of, micro, brew, beer, is, about, 3, kilograms, 6, 6, pounds, the, loss, of, natural, habitat, potential, from, the, 6, pack, of, micro, brew, beer, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 5, square, metres, 26, square, feet, downstream, emissions, from, distribution, retail, storage, and, disposal, of, waste, can, be, over, 45, of, a, bottled, micro, brew, beer, s, co, 2, emissions, where, legal, the, use, of, a, refillable, jug, reusable, bottle, or, other, reusable, containers, to, transport, draught, beer, from, a, store, or, a, bar, rather, than, buying, pre, bottled, beer, can, reduce, the, environmental, impact, of, beer, consumption, most, beers, are, cleared, of, yeast, by, filtering, when, packaged, in, bottles, and, cans, however, bottle, conditioned, beers, retain, some, yeast, either, by, being, unfiltered, or, by, being, filtered, and, then, reseeded, with, fresh, yeast, it, is, usually, recommended, that, the, beer, be, poured, slowly, leaving, any, yeast, sediment, at, the, bottom, of, the, bottle, however, some, drinkers, prefer, to, pour, in, the, yeast, this, practice, is, customary, with, wheat, beers, typically, when, serving, a, hefeweizen, wheat, beer, 90, of, the, contents, are, poured, and, the, remainder, is, swirled, to, suspend, the, sediment, before, pouring, it, into, the, glass, alternatively, the, bottle, may, be, inverted, prior, to, opening, glass, bottles, are, always, used, for, bottle, conditioned, beers, many, beers, are, sold, in, cans, though, there, is, considerable, variation, in, the, proportion, between, different, countries, in, sweden, in, 2001, 63, 9, of, beer, was, sold, in, cans, people, either, drink, from, the, can, or, pour, the, beer,

cans, were, initially, viewed, as, a, technological, breakthrough, for, maintaining, the, quality, of, a, beer, then, became, commonly, associated, with, less, expensive, mass, produced, beers, even, though, the, quality, of, storage, in, cans, is, much, like, bottles, plastic, pet, bottles, are, used, by, some, breweries, the, temperature, of, a, beer, has, an, influence, on, a, drinker, s,

and, food, pairings, some, breweries, have, developed, beers, to, pair, with, food, wine, writer, malcolm, gluck, disputed, the, need, to, pair, beer, with, food, while, beer, writers, roger, protz, and, melissa, cole, contested, that, claim, beer, is, considered, to, be, a, social, lubricant, in, many, societies, and, is, consumed, in, countries, all, over, the, world, there, are, breweries, in, middle, eastern, countries, such, as, syria, and, in, some, african, countries, sales, of, beer, are, four, times, those, of, wine, which, is, the, second, most, popular, alcoholic, drink, a, study, published, in, the, neuropsychopharmacology, journal, in, 2013, revealed, the, finding, that, the, flavour, of, beer, alone, could, provoke, dopamine, activity, in, the, brain, of, the, male, participants, who, wanted, to, drink, more, as, a, result, the, 49, men, in, the, study, were, subject, to, positron, emission, tomography, scans, while, a, computer, controlled, device, sprayed, minute, amounts, of, beer, water, and, a, sports, drink, onto, their, tongues, compared, with, the, taste, of, the, sports, drink, the, taste, of, beer, significantly, increased, the, participants, desire, to, drink, test, results, indicated, that, the, flavour, of, the, beer, triggered, a, dopamine, release, even, though, alcohol, content, in, the, spray, was, insufficient, for, the, purpose, of, becoming, intoxicated, around, the, world, there, are, many, traditional, and, ancient, starch, based, drinks, classed, as, beer, in, africa, there, are, various, ethnic, beers, made, from, sorghum, or, millet, such, as, oshikundu, in, namibia, and, tella, in, ethiopia, kyrgyzstan, also, has, a, beer, made, from, millet, it, is, a, low, alcohol, somewhat, porridge, like, drink, called, bozo, bhutan, nepal, tibet, and, sikkim, also, use, millet, in, chhaang, a, popular, semi, fermented, rice, millet, drink, in, the, eastern, himalayas, further, east, in, china, are, found, huangjiu, and, choujiu, traditional, rice, based, drinks, related, to, beer, the, andes, in, south, america, has, chicha, made, from, germinated, maize, corn, while, the, indigenous, peoples, in, brazil, have, cauim, a, traditional, drink, made, since, pre, columbian, times, by, chewing, manioc, so, that, an, enzyme, amylase, present, in, human, saliva, can, break, down, the, starch, into, fermentable, sugars, this, is, similar, to, masato, in, peru, some, beers, which, are, made, from, bread, which, is, linked, to, the, earliest, forms, of, beer, are, sahti, in, finland, kvass, in, russia, and,

replace, a, third, of, the, malted, barley, that, would, otherwise, be, used, for, brewing, their, craft, ale, a, 2016, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, found, that, moderate, ethanol, consumption, brought, no, mortality, benefit, compared, with, lifetime, abstention, from, ethanol, consumption, some, studies, have, concluded, that, drinking, small, quantities, of, alcohol, less, than, one, drink, in, women, and, two, in, men, per, day, is, associated, with, a, decreased, risk, of, heart, disease, stroke, diabetes, mellitus, and, early, death, some, of, these, studies, combined, former, ethanol, drinkers, and, lifelong, abstainers, into, a, single, group, of, nondrinkers, which, hides, the, health, benefits, of, lifelong, abstention, from, ethanol, the, long, term, health, effects, of, continuous, moderate, or, heavy, alcohol, consumption, include, the, risk, of, developing, alcoholism, and, alcoholic, liver, disease, alcoholism, also, known, as, alcohol, use, disorder, is, a, broad, term, for, any, drinking, of, alcohol, that, results, in, problems, it, was, previously, divided, into, two, types, alcohol, abuse, and, alcohol, dependence, in, a, medical, context, alcoholism, is, said, to, exist, when, two, or, more, of, the, following, conditions, are, present, a, person, drinks, large, amounts, over, a, long, time, period, has, difficulty, cutting, down, acquiring, and, drinking, alcohol, takes, up, a, great, deal, of, time, alcohol, is, strongly, desired, usage, results, in, not, fulfilling, responsibilities, usage, results, in, social, problems, usage, results, in, health, problems, usage, results, in, risky, situations, withdrawal, occurs, when, stopping, and, alcohol, tolerance, has, occurred, with, use, alcoholism, reduces, a, person, s, life, expectancy, by, around, ten, years, and, alcohol, use, is, the, third, leading, cause, of, early, death, in, the, united, states, no, professional, medical, association, recommends, that, people, who, are, nondrinkers, should, start, drinking, alcoholic, beverages, in, the, united, states, a, total, of, 3, 3, million, deaths, per, year, 5, 9, of, all, deaths, are, believed, to, be, due, to, alcohol, it, is, considered, that, overeating, and, lack, of, muscle, tone, is, the, main, cause, of, a, beer, belly, rather, than, beer, consumption, a, 2004, study, however, found, a, link, between, binge, drinking, and, a, beer, belly, but, with, most, overconsumption, it, is, more, a, problem, of, improper, exercise, and, overconsumption, of, carbohydrates, than, the, product, itself, several, diet, books, quote, beer, as, having, an, undesirably, high, glycemic, index, of, 110, the, same, as, maltose, however, the, maltose, in, beer, undergoes, metabolism, by, yeast, during, fermentation, so, that, beer, consists, mostly, of, water, hop, oils, and, only, trace, amounts, of, sugars, including, maltose
