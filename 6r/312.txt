tarot, t, r, o, first, known, as, trionfi, and, later, as, tarocchi, or, tarocks, is, a, pack, of, playing, cards, used, from, at, least, the, mid, 15th, century, in, various, parts, of, europe, to, play, card, games, such, as, tarocchini, from, their, italian, roots, tarot, playing, cards, spread, to, most, of, europe, evolving, into, a, family, of, games, that, includes, german, grosstarok, and, modern, games, such, as, french, tarot, and, austrian, k, nigrufen, in, the, late, 18th, century, french, occultists, made, elaborate, but, unsubstantiated, claims, about, their, history, and, meaning, leading, to, the, emergence, of, custom, decks, for, use, in, divination, via, tarot, card, reading, and, cartomancy, thus, there, are, two, distinct, types, of, tarot, packs, in, circulation, those, used, for, card, games, and, those, used, for, divination, however, some, older, patterns, such, as, the, tarot, de, marseille, originally, intended, for, playing, card, games, are, occasionally, used, for, cartomancy, like, the, common, playing, cards, tarot, has, four, suits, that, vary, by, region, french, suits, are, used, in, western, central, and, eastern, europe, and, latin, suits, in, southern, europe, each, suit, has, 14, cards, ten, pip, cards, numbering, from, one, or, ace, to, ten, and, four, face, cards, king, queen, knight, and, jack, knave, page, in, addition, and, unlike, standard, packs, the, tarot, also, has, a, separate, 21, card, trump, suit, and, a, single, card, known, as, the, fool, depending, on, the, game, the, fool, may, act, as, the, top, trump, or, may, be, played, to, avoid, following, suit, these, tarot, cards, are, still, used, throughout, much, of, europe, to, play, conventional, card, games, the, use, of, tarot, playing, cards, was, at, one, time, widespread, across, the, whole, of, europe, except, the, british, isles, and, the, iberian, peninsula, having, fallen, into, decline, by, the, 20th, century, they, later, experienced, a, renaissance, in, some, countries, and, regions, for, example, french, tarot, was, largely, confined, to, provence, in, the, 18th, century, but, took, off, in, the, 1950s, to, such, an, extent, that, in, 1973, the, french, tarot, association, f, d, ration, fran, aise, de, tarot, was, formed, and, french, tarot, itself, is, now, the, second, most, popular, card, game, in, france, tarock, games, like, k, nigrufen, have, experienced, significant, growth, in, austria, where, international, tournaments, are, held, with, other, nations, especially, those, from, eastern, europe, that, still, play, such, games, including, hungary, romania, slovakia, and, slovenia, denmark, appears, to, be, the, only, scandinavian, country, that, still, plays, tarot, games, danish, tarok, being, a, derivative, of, historical, german, grosstarock, the, game, of, cego, has, grown, in, popularity, again, in, the, south, german, region, of, baden, italy, continues, to, play, regionally, popular, games, with, their, distinctive, tarot, packs, these, include, ottocento, in, bologna, and, sicilian, tarocchi, in, parts, of, sicily, meanwhile, troccas, and, troggu, are, still, played, locally, in, parts, of, switzerland, tarot, cards, then, known, as, tarocchi, first, appeared, in, ferrara, and, milan, in, northern, italy, with, the, fool, and, 21, trumps, then, called, trionfi, being, added, to, the, standard, italian, pack, of, four, suits, batons, coins, cups, and, swords, scholarship, has, established, that, the, early, european, cards, were, probably, based, on, the, egyptian, mamluk, deck, invented, in, or, before, the, 14th, century, which, followed, the, introduction, of, paper, from, asia, into, western, europe, by, the, late, 1300s, europeans, were, producing, their, own, cards, the, earliest, patterns, being, based, on, the, mamluk, deck, but, with, variations, to, the, suit, symbols, and, court, cards, the, first, records, of, playing, cards, in, europe, date, to, 1367, in, bern, and, they, appear, to, have, spread, very, rapidly, across, the, whole, of, europe, as, may, be, seen, from, the, records, mainly, of, card, games, being, banned, little, is, known, about, the, appearance, and, number, of, these, cards, the, only, significant, information, being, provided, by, a, text, by, john, of, rheinfelden, in, 1377, from, freiburg, im, breisgau, who, in, addition, to, other, versions, describes, the, basic, pack, as, containing, the, still, current, 4, suits, of, 13, cards, the, courts, usually, being, the, king, ober, and, unter, marshals, although, dames, and, queens, were, already, known, by, then, an, early, pattern, of, playing, cards, used, the, suits, of, batons, or, clubs, coins, swords, and, cups, these, suits, are, still, used, in, traditional, italian, spanish, and, portuguese, playing, card, decks, and, are, also, used, in, modern, occult, tarot, divination, cards, that, first, appeared, in, the, late, 18th, century, a, lost, tarot, like, pack, was, commissioned, by, duke, filippo, maria, visconti, and, described, by, martiano, da, tortona, probably, between, 1418, and, 1425, since, the, painter, he, mentions, michelino, da, besozzo, returned, to, milan, in, 1418, while, martiano, himself, died, in, 1425, he, described, a, 60, card, deck, with, 16, cards, having, images, of, the, roman, gods, and, suits, depicting, four, kinds, of, birds, the, 16, cards, were, regarded, as, trumps, since, in, 1449, jacopo, antonio, marcello, recalled, that, the, now, deceased, duke, had, invented, a, novum, quoddam, et, exquisitum, triumphorum, genus, or, a, new, and, exquisite, kind, of, triumphs, other, early, decks, that, also, showcased, classical, motifs, include, the, sola, busca, and, boiardo, viti, decks, of, the, 1490s, the, first, documented, tarot, decks, were, recorded, between, 1440, and, 1450, in, milan, ferrara, florence, and, bologna, when, additional, trump, cards, with, allegorical, illustrations, were, added, to, the, common, four, suit, pack, these, new, decks, were, called, carte, da, trionfi, triumph, cards, and, the, additional, cards, known, simply, as, trionfi, which, became, trumps, in, english, the, earliest, documentation, of, trionfi, is, found, in, a, written, statement, in, the, court, records, of, florence, in, 1440, regarding, the, transfer, of, two, decks, to, sigismondo, pandolfo, malatesta, the, oldest, surviving, tarot, cards, are, the, 15, or, so, decks, of, the, visconti, sforza, tarot, painted, in, the, mid, 15th, century, for, the, rulers, of, the, duchy, of, milan, in, 15th, century, italy, the, set, of, cards, that, was, included, in, tarot, packs, including, trumps, seems, to, have, been, consistent, even, if, naming, and, ordering, varied, there, are, two, main, exceptions, although, a, dominican, preacher, inveighed, against, the, evil, inherent, in, playing, cards, chiefly, because, of, their, use, in, gambling, in, a, sermon, in, the, 15th, century, no, routine, condemnations, of, tarot, were, found, during, its, early, history, because, the, earliest, tarot, cards, were, hand, painted, the, number, of, the, decks, produced, is, thought, to, have, been, small, it, was, only, after, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, that, mass, production, of, cards, became, possible, the, expansion, of, tarot, outside, of, italy, first, to, france, and, switzerland, occurred, during, the, italian, wars, the, most, prominent, tarot, deck, version, used, in, these, two, countries, was, the, tarot, of, marseilles, of, milanese, origin, while, the, set, of, trumps, was, generally, consistent, their, order, varied, by, region, perhaps, as, early, as, the, 1440s, michael, dummett, placed, them, into, three, categories, in, bologna, and, florence, the, highest, trump, is, the, angel, followed, by, the, world, this, group, spread, mainly, southward, through, the, papal, states, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, finally, down, to, the, kingdom, of, sicily, but, was, also, known, in, the, savoyard, states, in, ferrara, the, world, was, the, highest, followed, by, justice, and, the, angel, this, group, spread, mainly, to, the, northeast, to, venice, and, trento, where, it, was, only, a, passing, fad, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, this, order, became, extinct, in, milan, the, world, was, highest, followed, by, the, angel, this, ordering, is, used, in, the, tarot, of, marseilles, dummett, also, wrote, about, a, possible, fourth, lineage, that, may, have, existed, along, the, franco, italian, border, it, spread, north, through, france, until, its, last, descendant, the, belgian, tarot, went, extinct, around, 1800, in, florence, an, expanded, deck, called, minchiate, was, later, used, this, deck, of, 97, cards, includes, astrological, symbols, and, the, four, elements, as, well, as, traditional, tarot, motifs, the, earliest, known, mention, of, this, game, under, the, name, of, germini, dates, to, 1506, the, word, tarot, and, german, tarock, derive, from, the, italian, tarocchi, the, origin, of, which, is, uncertain, although, taroch, was, used, as, a, synonym, for, foolishness, in, the, late, 15th, and, early, 16th, centuries, the, decks, were, known, exclusively, as, trionfi, during, the, fifteenth, century, the, new, name, first, appeared, in, brescia, around, 1502, as, tarocho, during, the, 16th, century, a, new, game, played, with, a, standard, deck, but, sharing, a, very, similar, name, trionfa, was, quickly, becoming, popular, this, coincided, with, the, older, game, being, renamed, tarocchi, in, modern, italian, the, singular, term, is, tarocco, which, as, a, noun, is, a, cultivar, of, blood, orange, the, attribute, tarocco, and, the, verb, taroccare, are, used, regionally, to, indicate, that, something, is, fake, or, forged, this, meaning, is, directly, derived, from, the, tarocchi, game, as, played, in, italy, in, which, tarocco, indicates, a, card, that, can, be, played, in, place, of, another, card, the, original, purpose, of, tarot, cards, was, to, play, games, a, very, cursory, explanation, of, rules, for, a, tarot, like, deck, is, given, in, a, manuscript, by, martiano, da, tortona, before, 1425, vague, descriptions, of, game, play, or, game, terminology, follow, for, the, next, two, centuries, until, the, earliest, known, complete, description, of, rules, for, a, french, variant, in, 1637, the, game, of, tarot, has, many, regional, variations, tarocchini, has, survived, in, bologna, and, there, are, still, others, played, in, piedmont, and, sicily, but, in, italy, the, game, is, generally, less, popular, than, elsewhere, the, 18th, century, saw, tarot, s, greatest, revival, during, which, it, became, one, of, the, most, popular, card, games, in, europe, played, everywhere, except, ireland, and, britain, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, ottoman, balkans, french, tarot, experienced, another, revival, beginning, in, the, 1970s, and, france, has, the, strongest, tarot, gaming, community, regional, tarot, games, often, known, as, tarock, tarok, or, tarokk, are, widely, played, in, central, europe, within, the, borders, of, the, former, austro, hungarian, empire, italian, suited, decks, were, first, devised, in, the, 15th, century, in, northern, italy, three, decks, of, this, category, are, still, used, to, play, certain, games, the, tarocco, siciliano, is, the, only, deck, to, use, the, so, called, portuguese, suit, system, which, uses, spanish, pips, but, intersects, them, like, italian, pips, some, of, the, trumps, are, different, such, as, the, lowest, trump, miseria, destitution, it, omits, the, two, and, three, of, coins, and, numerals, one, to, four, in, clubs, swords, and, cups, it, thus, has, 64, cards, but, the, ace, of, coins, is, not, used, being, the, bearer, of, the, former, stamp, tax, the, cards, are, quite, small, and, not, reversible, the, sole, surviving, example, of, a, spanish, suited, deck, was, produced, around, 1820, by, giacomo, recchi, of, oneglia, liguria, and, destined, for, sardinia, the, plain, suit, cards, are, copied, from, the, sardinian, pattern, designed, just, ten, years, earlier, by, jos, martinez, de, castro, for, clemente, roxas, in, madrid, but, with, the, addition, of, 10s, and, queens, the, trumps, are, largely, copied, from, an, early, version, of, the, tarocco, piemontese, at, that, time, liguria, sardinia, and, piedmont, were, all, territories, of, the, savoyard, state, french, suited, tarot, decks, are, known, as, the, oldest, decks, used, for, the, tarot, with, the, exception, of, novelty, decks, french, suited, tarot, cards, are, almost, exclusively, used, for, card, games, the, earliest, french, suited, tarot, decks, were, made, by, the, de, poilly, family, of, engravers, beginning, with, a, minchiate, deck, by, fran, ois, de, poilly, in, the, late, 1650s, aside, from, these, early, outliers, the, first, generation, of, french, suited, tarots, depicted, scenes, of, animals, on, the, trumps, and, were, thus, called, tiertarock, tier, being, german, for, animal, appeared, around, 1740, around, 1800, a, greater, variety, of, decks, were, produced, mostly, with, genre, art, or, veduta, the, german, states, used, to, produce, a, variety, of, 78, card, tarot, packs, using, italian, suits, but, later, switching, to, french, suited, cards, some, were, imported, to, france, there, remain, only, two, french, suited, patterns, of, cego, packs, the, cego, adler, pack, manufactured, by, ass, altenburger, and, one, with, genre, scenes, by, f, x, schmid, which, may, reflect, the, mainstream, german, cards, of, the, 19th, century, current, french, suited, tarot, decks, come, in, these, patterns, from, the, late, 18th, century, in, addition, to, producing, their, own, true, tarot, packs, the, south, german, states, manufactured, german, suited, packs, labeled, taroc, tarock, or, deutsch, tarok, these, survive, as, schafkopf, tarock, packs, of, the, bavarian, and, franconian, pattern, these, are, not, true, tarot, packs, but, standard, 36, card, german, suited, decks, for, games, like, german, tarok, bauerntarock, w, rttemberg, tarock, and, bavarian, tarock, until, the, 1980s, there, were, also, tarock, packs, in, the, w, rttemberg, pattern, there, are, 36, cards, the, pip, cards, ranging, from, 6, to, 10, under, knave, unter, over, knave, ober, king, and, ace, these, use, ace, ten, ranking, like, klaverjas, where, ace, is, the, highest, followed, by, 10, king, ober, unter, then, 9, to, 6, the, heart, suit, is, the, default, trump, suit, the, bavarian, pack, is, also, used, to, play, schafkopf, by, excluding, the, sixes, in, english, speaking, countries, where, these, games, are, not, widely, played, only, specially, designed, cartomantic, tarot, cards, used, primarily, for, novelty, and, divination, are, readily, available, the, early, french, occultists, claimed, that, tarot, cards, had, esoteric, links, to, ancient, egypt, kabbalah, the, indic, tantra, or, i, ching, claims, that, have, been, frequently, repeated, by, authors, on, card, divination, however, scholarly, research, demonstrated, that, tarot, cards, were, invented, in, northern, italy, in, the, mid, 15th, century, and, confirmed, that, there, is, no, historical, evidence, of, any, significant, use, of, tarot, cards, for, divination, until, the, late, 18th, century, historians, have, described, western, views, of, the, tarot, pack, as, the, subject, of, the, most, successful, propaganda, campaign, ever, launched, an, entire, false, history, and, false, interpretation, of, the, tarot, pack, was, concocted, by, the, occultists, and, it, is, all, but, universally, believed, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, tarot, deck, used, for, cartomancy, comes, from, an, anonymous, manuscript, from, around, 1750, which, documents, rudimentary, divinatory, meanings, for, the, cards, of, the, tarocco, bolognese, the, popularization, of, esoteric, tarot, started, with, antoine, court, and, jean, baptiste, alliette, etteilla, in, paris, during, the, 1780s, using, the, tarot, of, marseilles, french, tarot, players, abandoned, the, marseilles, tarot, in, favor, of, the, tarot, nouveau, around, 1900, with, the, result, that, the, marseilles, pattern, is, now, used, mostly, by, cartomancers, etteilla, was, the, first, to, produce, a, bespoke, tarot, deck, specifically, designed, for, occult, purposes, around, 1789, in, keeping, with, the, unsubstantiated, belief, that, such, cards, were, derived, from, the, book, of, thoth, etteilla, s, tarot, contained, themes, related, to, ancient, egypt, in, the, occult, tradition, tarot, cards, are, referred, to, as, arcana, with, the, fool, and, 21, trumps, being, termed, the, major, arcana, and, the, suit, cards, the, minor, arcana, terms, not, used, by, players, of, tarot, card, games, the, 78, card, tarot, deck, used, by, esotericists, has, two, distinct, parts, the, terms, major, arcana, and, minor, arcana, were, first, used, by, jean, baptiste, pitois, also, known, as, paul, christian, and, are, never, used, in, relation, to, tarot, card, games, some, decks, exist, primarily, as, artwork, and, such, art, decks, sometimes, contain, only, the, 22, major, arcana, the, three, most, common, decks, used, in, esoteric, tarot, are, the, tarot, of, marseilles, a, playing, card, pack, the, rider, waite, tarot, and, the, thoth, tarot, aleister, crowley, who, devised, the, thoth, deck, along, with, lady, frieda, harris, stated, of, the, tarot, the, origin, of, this, pack, of, cards, is, very, obscure, some, authorities, seek, to, put, it, back, as, far, as, the, ancient, egyptian, mysteries, others, try, to, bring, it, forward, as, late, as, the, fifteenth, or, even, the, sixteenth, century, the, only, theory, of, ultimate, interest, about, the, tarot, is, that, it, is, an, admirable, symbolic, picture, of, the, universe, based, on, the, data, of, the, holy, qabalah
