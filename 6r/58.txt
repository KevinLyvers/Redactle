a, biscuit, in, many, english, speaking, countries, including, britain, ireland, australia, new, zealand, india, and, south, africa, but, not, canada, or, the, us, is, a, flour, based, baked, and, shaped, food, item, biscuits, are, typically, hard, flat, and, unleavened, they, are, usually, sweet, and, may, be, made, with, sugar, chocolate, icing, jam, ginger, or, cinnamon, they, can, also, be, savoury, similar, to, crackers, types, of, biscuit, include, sandwich, biscuits, digestive, biscuits, ginger, biscuits, shortbread, biscuits, chocolate, chip, cookies, chocolate, coated, marshmallow, treats, anzac, biscuits, biscotti, and, speculaas, in, most, of, north, america, nearly, all, hard, sweet, biscuits, are, called, cookies, and, savoury, biscuits, are, called, crackers, while, the, term, biscuit, is, used, for, a, soft, leavened, quick, bread, similar, to, a, savoury, version, of, a, scone, the, modern, day, difference, in, the, english, language, regarding, the, word, biscuit, is, remarked, on, by, british, cookery, writer, elizabeth, david, in, english, bread, and, yeast, cookery, in, the, chapter, yeast, buns, and, small, tea, cakes, and, section, soft, biscuits, she, writes, it, is, interesting, that, these, soft, biscuits, such, as, scones, are, common, to, scotland, and, guernsey, and, that, the, term, biscuit, as, applied, to, a, soft, product, was, retained, in, these, places, and, in, america, whereas, in, england, it, has, completely, died, out, the, old, french, word, bescuit, is, derived, from, the, latin, words, bis, twice, and, coquere, coctus, to, cook, cooked, and, hence, means, twice, cooked, this, is, because, biscuits, were, originally, cooked, in, a, twofold, process, first, baked, and, then, dried, out, in, a, slow, oven, this, term, was, then, adapted, into, english, in, the, 14th, century, during, the, middle, ages, in, the, middle, english, word, bisquite, to, represent, a, hard, twice, baked, product, see, the, german, zwieback, it, finally, evolved, into, biscuit, to, follow, the, modern, french, spelling, the, dutch, language, from, around, 1703, had, adopted, the, word, koekje, little, cake, to, have, a, similar, meaning, for, a, similar, hard, baked, product, the, difference, between, the, secondary, dutch, word, and, that, of, latin, origin, is, that, whereas, the, koekje, is, a, cake, that, rises, during, baking, the, biscuit, which, has, no, raising, agent, in, general, does, not, see, gingerbread, ginger, biscuit, except, for, the, expansion, of, heated, air, during, baking, another, cognate, dutch, form, is, beschuit, which, is, a, circular, and, brittle, grain, product, usually, covered, by, savoury, or, sweet, toppings, and, eaten, at, breakfast, when, continental, europeans, began, to, emigrate, to, colonial, north, america, the, two, words, and, their, same, but, different, meanings, began, to, clash, the, words, cookie, or, cracker, became, the, words, of, choice, to, mean, a, hard, baked, product, further, confusion, has, been, added, by, the, adoption, of, the, word, biscuit, for, a, small, leavened, bread, popular, in, the, united, states, according, to, the, american, english, dictionary, merriam, webster, a, cookie, is, a, small, flat, or, slightly, raised, cake, a, biscuit, is, any, of, various, hard, or, crisp, dry, baked, product, similar, to, the, american, english, terms, cracker, or, cookie, or, a, small, quick, bread, made, from, dough, that, has, been, rolled, out, and, cut, or, dropped, from, a, spoon, in, a, number, of, other, european, languages, terms, derived, from, the, latin, bis, coctus, refer, instead, to, yet, another, baked, product, similar, to, the, sponge, cake, e, g, spanish, bizcocho, german, biskuit, russian, biskvit, and, polish, biszkopt, in, modern, italian, usage, the, term, biscotto, is, used, to, refer, to, any, type, of, hard, twice, baked, biscuit, and, not, only, to, the, cantucci, as, in, english, speaking, countries, it, is, the, same, for, the, modern, french, term, biscuit, the, need, for, nutritious, easy, to, store, easy, to, carry, and, long, lasting, foods, on, long, journeys, in, particular, at, sea, was, initially, solved, by, taking, livestock, along, with, a, butcher, cook, however, this, took, up, additional, space, on, what, were, either, horse, powered, treks, or, small, ships, reducing, the, time, of, travel, before, additional, food, was, required, this, resulted, in, early, armies, adopting, the, style, of, hunter, foraging, the, introduction, of, the, baking, of, processed, cereals, including, the, creation, of, flour, provided, a, more, reliable, source, of, food, egyptian, sailors, carried, a, flat, brittle, loaf, of, millet, bread, called, dhourra, cake, while, the, romans, had, a, biscuit, called, buccellum, roman, cookbook, apicius, describes, a, thick, paste, of, fine, wheat, flour, was, boiled, and, spread, out, on, a, plate, when, it, had, dried, and, hardened, it, was, cut, up, and, then, fried, until, crisp, then, served, with, honey, and, pepper, many, early, physicians, believed, that, most, medicinal, problems, were, associated, with, digestion, hence, for, both, sustenance, and, avoidance, of, illness, a, daily, consumption, of, a, biscuit, was, considered, good, for, health, hard, biscuits, soften, as, they, age, to, solve, this, problem, early, bakers, attempted, to, create, the, hardest, biscuit, possible, because, it, is, so, hard, and, dry, if, properly, stored, and, transported, navies, hardtack, will, survive, rough, handling, and, high, temperature, baked, hard, it, can, be, kept, without, spoiling, for, years, as, long, as, it, is, kept, dry, for, long, voyages, hardtack, was, baked, four, times, rather, than, the, more, common, two, to, soften, hardtack, for, eating, it, was, often, dunked, in, brine, coffee, or, some, other, liquid, or, cooked, into, a, skillet, meal, the, collection, sayings, of, the, desert, fathers, mentions, that, anthony, the, great, who, lived, in, the, 4th, century, ad, ate, biscuits, and, the, text, implies, that, it, was, a, popular, food, among, monks, of, the, time, and, region, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, armada, in, 1588, the, daily, allowance, on, board, a, royal, navy, ship, was, one, pound, of, biscuit, plus, one, gallon, of, beer, samuel, pepys, in, 1667, first, regularised, naval, victualling, with, varied, and, nutritious, rations, royal, navy, hardtack, during, queen, victoria, s, reign, was, made, by, machine, at, the, royal, clarence, victualling, yard, at, gosport, hampshire, stamped, with, the, queen, s, mark, and, the, number, of, the, oven, in, which, they, were, baked, when, machinery, was, introduced, into, the, process, the, dough, was, thoroughly, mixed, and, rolled, into, sheets, about, 2, yards, 1, 8, m, long, and, 1, yard, 0, 9, m, wide, which, were, stamped, in, one, stroke, into, about, sixty, hexagonal, shaped, biscuits, this, left, the, sheets, sufficiently, coherent, to, be, placed, in, the, oven, in, one, piece, and, when, baked, they, were, easy, to, separate, the, hexagonal, shape, rather, than, traditional, circular, biscuits, meant, a, saving, in, material, and, was, easier, to, pack, biscuits, remained, an, important, part, of, the, royal, navy, sailor, s, diet, until, the, introduction, of, canned, foods, canned, meat, was, first, marketed, in, 1814, preserved, beef, in, tins, was, officially, added, to, royal, navy, rations, in, 1847, early, biscuits, were, hard, dry, and, unsweetened, they, were, most, often, cooked, after, bread, in, a, cooling, bakers, oven, they, were, a, cheap, form, of, sustenance, for, the, poor, by, the, 7th, century, ad, cooks, of, the, persian, empire, had, learnt, from, their, forebears, the, techniques, of, lightening, and, enriching, bread, based, mixtures, with, eggs, butter, and, cream, and, sweetening, them, with, fruit, and, honey, one, of, the, earliest, spiced, biscuits, was, gingerbread, in, french, pain, d, pices, meaning, spice, bread, brought, to, europe, in, 992, by, the, armenian, monk, gr, goire, de, nicopolis, he, left, nicopolis, pompeii,

this, was, originally, a, dense, treaclely, molasses, based, spice, cake, or, bread, as, it, was, so, expensive, to, make, early, ginger, biscuits, were, a, cheap, form, of, using, up, the, leftover, bread, mix, with, the, combination, of, knowledge, spreading, from, al, andalus, and, then, the, crusades, and, subsequent, spread, of, the, spice, trade, to, europe, the, cooking, techniques, and, ingredients, of, arabia, spread, into, northern, europe, by, mediaeval, times, biscuits, were, made, from, a, sweetened, spiced, paste, of, breadcrumbs, and, then, baked, e, g, gingerbread, or, from,

muslin, which, was, a, mixed, corn, compound, of, barley, rye, and, bean, flour, as, the, making, and, quality, of, bread, had, been, controlled, to, this, point, so, were, the, skills, of, biscuit, making, through, the, craft, guilds, as, the, supply, of, sugar, began, and, the, refinement, and, supply, of, flour, increased, so, did, the, ability, to, sample, more, leisurely, foodstuffs,
