routes, the, marathon, can, be, completed, by, running, or, with, a, run, walk, strategy, there, are, also, wheelchair, divisions, more, than, 800, marathons, are, held, worldwide, each, year, with, the, vast, majority, of, competitors, being, recreational, athletes, as, larger, marathons, can, have, tens, of, thousands, of, participants, a, creation, of, the, french, philologist, michel, br, al, the, marathon, was, one, of, the, original, modern, olympic, events, in, 1896, the, distance, did, not, become, standardized, until, 1921, the, distance, is, also, included, in, the, world, athletics, championships, which, began, in, 1983, it, is, the, only, running, road, race, included, in, both, championship, competitions, walking, races, on, the, roads, are, also, contested, in, both, the, name, marathon, comes, from, the, legend, of, pheidippides, the, greek, messenger, the, legend, states, that, while, he, was, taking, part, in, the, battle, of, marathon, which, took, place, in, august, or, september, 490, bc, he, witnessed, a, persian, vessel, changing, its, course, towards, athens, as, the, battle, was, near, a, victorious, end, for, the, greek, army, he, interpreted, this, as, an, attempt, by, the, defeated, persians, to, rush, into, the, city, to, claim, a, false, victory, or, simply, raid, hence, claiming, their, authority, over, greek, land, it, was, said, that, he, ran, the, entire, distance, to, athens, without, stopping, discarding, his, weapons, and, even, clothes, to, lose, as, much, weight, as, possible, and, burst, into, the, assembly, exclaiming, we, have, won, before, collapsing, and, dying, the, account, of, the, run, from, marathon, to, athens, first, appeared, in, plutarch, s, on, the, glory, of, athens, in, the, first, century, ad, which, quoted, from, heraclides, ponticus, s, lost, work, giving, the, runner, s, name, as, either, thersipus, of, erchius, or, eucles, this, was, the, account, adopted, by, benjamin, haydon, for, his, painting, eucles, announcing, the, victory, of, marathon, published, as, an, engraving, in, 1836, with, a, poetical, illustration, by, letitia, elizabeth, landon, satirist, lucian, of, samosata, gave, one, of, the, earliest, accounts, similar, to, the, modern, version, of, the, story, but, its, historical, veracity, is, disputed, based, on, its, tongue, in, cheek, writing, and, the, runner, being, referred, to, as, philippides, and, not, pheidippides, there, is, debate, about, the, historical, accuracy, of, this, legend, the, greek, historian, herodotus, the, main, source, for, the, greco, persian, wars, mentioned, philippides, as, the, messenger, who, ran, from, athens, to, sparta, asking, for, help, and, then, ran, back, a, distance, of, over, 240, kilometres, 150, mi, each, way, in, some, herodotus, manuscripts, the, name, of, the, runner, between, athens, and, sparta, is, given, as, philippides, herodotus, makes, no, mention, of, a, messenger, sent, from, marathon, to, athens, and, relates, that, the, main, part, of, the, athenian, army, having, fought, and, won, the, grueling, battle, and, fearing, a, naval, raid, by, the, persian, fleet, against, an, undefended, athens, marched, quickly, back, from, the, battle, to, athens, arriving, the, same, day, in, 1879, robert, browning, wrote, the, poem, pheidippides, browning, s, poem, his, composite, story, became, part, of, late, 19th, century, popular, culture, and, was, accepted, as, a, historical, legend, mount, pentelicus, stands, between, marathon, and, athens, which, means, that, philippides, would, have, had, to, run, around, the, mountain, either, to, the, north, or, to, the, south, the, latter, and, more, obvious, route, is, followed, by, the, modern, marathon, athens, highway, eo83, eo54, which, follows, the, lay, of, the, land, southwards, from, marathon, bay, and, along, the, coast, then, takes, a, gentle, but, protracted, climb, westwards, towards, the, eastern, approach, to, athens, between, the, foothills, of, mounts, hymettus, and, penteli, and, then, gently, downhill, to, athens, proper, as, it, existed, when, the, olympics, were, revived, in, 1896, this, route, was, approximately, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, long, it, was, the, approximate, distance, originally, used, for, marathon, races, however, there, have, been, suggestions, that, philippides, might, have, followed, another, route, a, westward, climb, along, the, eastern, and, northern, slopes, of, mount, penteli, to, the, pass, of, dionysos, and, then, a, straight, southward, downhill, path, to, athens, this, route, is, slightly, shorter, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, but, includes, a, very, steep, climb, over, the, first, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, when, the, modern, olympics, began, in, 1896, the, initiators, and, organizers, were, looking, for, a, great, popularizing, event, recalling, the, glory, of, ancient, greece, the, idea, of, a, marathon, race, came, from, michel, br, al, who, wanted, the, event, to, feature, in, the, first, modern, olympic, games, in, 1896, in, athens, this, idea, was, heavily, supported, by, pierre, de, coubertin, the, founder, of, the, modern, olympics, as, well, as, by, the, greeks, a, selection, race, for, the, olympic, marathon, was, held, on, 22, march, 1896, gregorian, that, was, won, by, charilaos, vasilakos, in, 3, hours, and, 18, minutes, the, winner, of, the,

italian, stefano, baldini, in, 2, hours, 10, minutes, and, 55, seconds, a, record, time, for, this, route, until, the, non, olympics, athens, classic, marathon, of, 2014, when, felix, kandie, lowered, the, course, record, to, 2, hours, 10, minutes, and, 37, seconds, the, women, s, marathon, was, introduced, at, the, 1984, summer, olympics, los, angeles, us, and, was, won, by, joan, benoit, of, the, united, states, with, a, time, of, 2, hours, 24, minutes, and, 52, seconds, it, has, become, a, tradition, for, the, men, s, olympic, marathon, to, be, the, last, event, of, the, athletics, calendar, on, the, final, day, of, the, olympics, for, many, years, the, race, finished, inside, the, olympic, stadium, however, at, the, 2012, summer, olympics, london, the, start, and, finish, were, on, the,

more, races, of, marathon, distance, or, longer, at, least, 10, of, these, events, must, be, united, kingdom, or, ireland, road, marathons, club, chairman, roger, biggs, has, run, more, than, 700, marathons, or, ultras, brian, mills, completed, his, 800th, marathon, on, 17, september, 2011, steve, edwards, a, member, of, the, 100, marathon, club, set, the, world, record, for, running, 500, marathons, in, the, fastest, average, finish, time, of, 3, hours, 15, minutes, at, the, same, time, becoming, the, first, man, to, run, 500, marathons, with, an, official, time, below, 3, hours, 30, minutes, on, 11, november, 2012, at, milton, keynes, england, the, records, took, 24, years, to, achieve, edwards, was, 49, at, the, time, over, 350, individuals, have, completed, a, marathon, in, each, state, of, the, united, states, plus, washington, d, c, and, some, have, done, it, as, many, as, eight, times, beverly, paquin, a, 22, year, old, nurse, from, iowa, was, the, youngest, woman, to, run, a, marathon, in, all, 50, states, in, 2010, a, few, weeks, later, still, in, 2010, morgan, cummings, also, 22, became, the, youngest, woman, to, complete, a, marathon, in, all, 50, states, and, dc, in, 2004, chuck, bryant, of, miami, florida, who, lost, his, right, leg, below, the, knee, became, the, first, amputee, to, finish, this, circuit, bryant, has, completed, a, total, of, 59, marathons, on, his, prosthesis, twenty, seven, people, have, run, a, marathon, on, each, of, the, seven, continents, and, 31, people, have, run, a, marathon, in, each, of, the, canadian, provinces, in, 1980, in, what, was, termed, the, marathon, of, hope, terry, fox, who, had, lost, a, leg, to, cancer, and, so, ran, with, one, artificial, leg, attained, 5, 373, km, 3, 339, mi, of, his, proposed,

2011, patrick, finney, of, grapevine, texas, became, the, first, person, with, multiple, sclerosis, to, finish, a, marathon, in, each, state, of, the, united, states, in, 2004, the, disease, had, left, him, unable, to, walk, but, unwilling, to, endure, a, life, of, infirmity, finney, managed, to, regain, his, ability, to, balance, on, two, feet, to, walk, and, eventually, to, run, through, extensive, rehabilitation, therapy, and, new, medications, in, 2003, british, adventurer, sir, ranulph, fiennes, completed, seven, marathons, on, seven, continents, in, seven, days, he, completed, this, feat, despite, suffering, from, a, heart, attack, and, undergoing, a, double, heart, bypass, operation, just, four, months, before, this, feat, has, since, been, eclipsed, by, irish, ultramarathon, runner, richard, donovan, who, in, 2009, completed, seven, marathons, on, seven, continents, in, under, 132, hours, five, and, a, half, days, starting, 1, february, 2012, he, improved, on, this, by, completing, the, 7, on, 7, in, under, 120, hours, or, in, less, than, five, days, on, 30, november, 2013, 69, year, old, larry, macon, set, a, guinness, world, record, for, most, marathons, run, in, a, year, by, man, by, running, 238, marathons, larry, macon, celebrated, his, 1, 000th, career, marathon, at, the, cowtown, marathon, in, ft, worth, on, 24, february, 2013, other, goals, are, to, attempt, to, run, marathons, on, a, series, of, consecutive, weekends, richard, worley, on, 159, weekends, or, to, run, the, most, marathons, during, a, particular, year, or, the, most, in, a, lifetime, a, pioneer, in, running, multiple, marathons, was, sy, mah, of, toledo, ohio, who, ran, 524, before, he, died, in, 1988, as, of, 30, june, 2007, horst, preisler, of, germany, had, successfully, completed, 1214, marathons, plus, 347, ultramarathons, a, total, of, 1561, events, at, marathon, distance, or, longer, sigrid, eichner, christian, hottas, and, hans, joachim, meyer, have, also, all, completed, over, 1000, marathons, each, norm, frank, of, the, united, states, is, credited, with, 945, marathons, christian, hottas, is, meanwhile, the, first, runner, who, ever, completed, 2000, marathons, he, ran, his, 2000th, at, tui, marathon, hannover, on, 5, may, 2013, together, with, a, group, of, more, than, 80, friends, from, 11, countries, including, 8, officers, from, the, 100, marathons, clubs, u, k, north, america, germany, denmark, austria, and, italy, hottas, completed, his, 2500th, marathon, on, 4, december, 2016, in, 2010, stefaan, engels, a, belgian, set, out, to, run, the, marathon, distance, every, day, of, the, year, because, of, a, foot, injury, he, had, to, resort, to, a, handcycle, near, the, end, of, january, 2010, however, on, 5, february, he, was, fully, recovered, and, decided, to, reset, the, counter, back, to, zero, by, 30, march, he, broke, the, existing, record, of, akinori, kusuda, from, japan, who, completed, 52, marathons, in, a, row, in, 2009, on, 5, february, 2011, engels, had, run, 365, marathon, distances, in, as, many, days, ricardo, abad, mart, nez, from, spain, later, ran, 150, marathons, in, 150, consecutive, days, in, 2009, and, subsequently, 500, marathons, in, a, row, from, october, 2010, to, february, 2012, some, runners, compete, to, run, the, same, marathons, for, the, most, consecutive, years, for, example, johnny, kelley, completed, 58, boston, marathons, he, entered, the, race, 61, times, currently, the, longest, consecutive, streak, of, boston, marathon, finishes, 45, in, a, row, is, held, by, bennett, beach, of, bethesda, maryland, most, participants, do, not, run, a, marathon, to, win, more, important, for, most, runners, is, their, personal, finishing, time, and, their, placement, within, their, specific, gender, and, age, group, though, some, runners, just, want, to, finish, strategies, for, completing, a, marathon, include, running, the, whole, distance, and, a, run, walk, strategy, in, 2005, the, average, marathon, time, in, the, u, s, was, 4, hours, 32, minutes, 8, seconds, for, men, 5, hours, 6, minutes, 8, seconds, for, women, in, 2015, the, men, s, and, women, s, median, marathon, times, were, 4, hours, 20, minutes, 13, seconds, and, 4, hours, 45, minutes, 30, seconds, respectively, a, goal, many, runners, aim, for, is, to, break, certain, time, barriers, for, example, recreational, first, timers, often, try, to, run, the, marathon, under, four, hours, more, competitive, runners, may, attempt, to, finish, under, three, hours, other, benchmarks, are, the, qualifying, times, for, major, marathons, the, boston, marathon, the, oldest, marathon, in, the, united, states, requires, a, qualifying, time, for, all, non, professional, runners, the, new, york, city, marathon, also, requires, a, qualifying, time, for, guaranteed, entry, at, a, significantly, faster, pace, than, boston, s, typically, there, is, a, maximum, allowed, time, of, about, six, hours, after, which, the, marathon, route, is, closed, although, some, larger, marathons, keep, the, course, open, considerably, longer, eight, hours, or, more, many, marathons, around, the, world, have, such, time, limits, by, which, all, runners, must, have, crossed, the, finish, line, anyone, slower, than, the, limit, will, be, picked, up, by, a, sweeper, bus, in, many, cases, the, marathon, organizers, are, required, to, reopen, the, roads, to, the, public, so, that, traffic, can, return, to, normal, with, the, growth, in, popularity, of, marathon, running, many, marathons, across, the, united, states, and, the, world, have, been, filling, to, capacity, faster, than, ever, before, when, the, boston, marathon, opened, up, registration, for, its, 2011, running, the, field, capacity, was, filled, within, eight, hours, the, long, run, is, an, important, element, in, marathon, training, recreational, runners, commonly, try, to, reach, a, maximum, of, about, 32, km, 20, mi, in, their, longest, weekly, run, and, a, total, of, about, 64, km, 40, mi, a, week, when, training, for, the, marathon, but, wide, variability, exists, in, practice, and, in, recommendations, more, experienced, marathoners, may, run, a, longer, distance, during, the, week, greater, weekly, training, mileages, can, offer, greater, results, in, terms, of, distance, and, endurance, but, also, carry, a, greater, risk, of, training, injury, most, male, elite, marathon, runners, will, complete, weekly, distances, of, over, 160, km, 100, mi, it, is, recommended, that, those, new, to, running, should, get, a, checkup, from, their, doctor, as, there, are, certain, warning, signs, and, risk, factors, that, should, be, evaluated, before, undertaking, any, new, workout, program, especially, marathon, training, many, training, programs, last, a, minimum, of, five, or, six, months, with, a, gradual, increase, in, the, distance, run, and, finally, for, recovery, a, period, of, tapering, in, the, one, to, three, weeks, preceding, the, race, for, beginners, wishing, to, merely, finish, a, marathon, a, minimum, of, four, months, of, running, four, days, a, week, is, recommended, many, trainers, recommend, a, weekly, increase, in, mileage, of, no, more, than, 10, it, is, also, often, advised, to, maintain, a, consistent, running, program, for, six, weeks, or, so, before, beginning, a, marathon, training, program, to, allow, the, body, to, adapt, to, the, new, stresses, the, marathon, training, program, itself, would, suppose, variation, between, hard, and, easy, training, with, a, periodization, of, the, general, plan, training, programs, can, be, found, at, the, websites, of, runner, s, world, hal, higdon, jeff, galloway, and, the, boston, athletic, association, and, in, numerous, other, published, sources, including, the, websites, of, specific, marathons, the, last, long, training, run, might, be, undertaken, up, to, two, weeks, prior, to, the, event, many, marathon, runners, also, carbo, load, increase, carbohydrate, intake, while, holding, total, caloric, intake, constant, during, the, week, before, the, marathon, to, allow, their, bodies, to, store, more, glycogen, carbohydrates, that, a, person, eats, are, converted, by, the, liver, and, muscles, into, glycogen, for, storage, glycogen, burns, rapidly, to, provide, quick, energy, runners, can, store, about, 8, mj, or, 2, 000, kcal, worth, of, glycogen, in, their, bodies, enough, for, about, 30, km, 18, 20, miles, of, running, many, runners, report, that, running, becomes, noticeably, more, difficult, at, that, point, when, glycogen, runs, low, the, body, must, then, obtain, energy, by, burning, stored, fat, which, does, not, burn, as, readily, when, this, happens, the, runner, will, experience, dramatic, fatigue, and, is, said, to, hit, the, wall, the, aim, of, training, for, the, marathon, according, to, many, coaches, is, to, maximize, the, limited, glycogen, available, so, that, the, fatigue, of, the, wall, is, not, as, dramatic, this, is, accomplished, in, part, by, utilizing, a, higher, percentage, of, energy, from, burned, fat, even, during, the, early, phase, of, the, race, thus, conserving, glycogen, carbohydrate, based, energy, gels, are, used, by, runners, to, avoid, or, reduce, the, effect, of, hitting, the, wall, as, they, provide, easy, to, digest, energy, during, the, run, energy, gels, usually, contain, varying, amounts, of, sodium, and, potassium, and, some, also, contain, caffeine, they, need, to, be, consumed, with, a, certain, amount, of, water, recommendations, for, how, often, to, take, an, energy, gel, during, the, race, range, widely, alternatives, to, gels, include, various, forms, of, concentrated, sugars, and, foods, high, in, simple, carbohydrates, that, can, be, digested, easily, many, runners, experiment, with, consuming, energy, supplements, during, training, runs, to, determine, what, works, best, for, them, consumption, of, food, while, running, sometimes, makes, the, runner, sick, runners, are, advised, not, to, ingest, a, new, food, or, medicine, just, prior, to, or, during, a, race, it, is, also, important, to, refrain, from, taking, any, of, the, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, class, of, pain, relievers, nsaids, e, g, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, as, these, drugs, may, change, the, way, the, kidneys, regulate, their, blood, flow, and, may, lead, to, serious, kidney, problems, especially, in, cases, involving, moderate, to, severe, dehydration, nsaids, block, the, cox, 2, enzyme, pathway, to, prevent, the, production, of, prostaglandins, these, prostaglandins, may, act, as, inflammation, factors, throughout, the, body, but, they, also, play, a, crucial, role, in, maintenance, of, water, retention, in, less, than, 5, of, the, whole, population, that, take, nsaids, individuals, may, be, more, negatively, sensitive, to, renal, prostaglandin, synthesis, inhibition, a, study, of, the, performance, of, 1, 8, million, participants, in, the, berlin, london, paris, boston, chicago, and, new, york, marathons, during, the, years, from, 2001, to, 2010, found, that, runners, recorded, their, fastest, times, when, the, temperature, was, around, 6, c, 43, f, with, an, increase, of, 10, c, 18, f, leading, to, a, 1, 5, reduction, in, speed, a, july, 2020, study, found, that, increasing, temperatures, affected, faster, runners, performance, more, than, slower, ones, marathon, participation, may, result, in, various, medical, musculoskeletal, and, dermatological, complaints, delayed, onset, muscle, soreness, doms, is, a, common, condition, affecting, runners, during, the, first, week, following, a, marathon, various, types, of, mild, exercise, or, massage, have, been, recommended, to, alleviate, pain, secondary, to, doms, dermatological, issues, frequently, include, jogger, s, nipple, jogger, s, toe, and, blisters, the, immune, system, is, reportedly, suppressed, for, a, short, time, changes, to, the, blood, chemistry, such, as, elevated, cardiac, troponin, t, may, lead, physicians, to, mistakenly, diagnose, heart, malfunction, after, long, training, runs, and, the, marathon, itself, consuming, carbohydrates, to, replace, glycogen, stores, and, protein, to, aid, muscle, recovery, is, commonly, recommended, in, addition, soaking, the, lower, half, of, the, body, for, approximately, 20, minutes, in, cold, or, ice, water, may, force, blood, through, the, leg, muscles, to, speed, recovery, marathon, running, has, various, health, risks, though, these, can, be, diminished, with, preparation, and, care, training, and, the, races, themselves, can, put, runners, under, stress, while, very, rare, even, death, is, a, possibility, during, a, race, common, minor, health, risks, include, blisters, tendonitis, fatigue, knee, or, ankle, sprain, dehydration, electrolyte, imbalance, and, other, conditions, many, are, categorised, as, overuse, injuries, in, 2016, a, systematic, medical, review, found, that, the, risk, of, sudden, cardiac, death, during, or, immediately, after, a, marathon, was, between, 0, 6, and, 1, 9, deaths, per, 100, 000, participants, varying, across, the, specific, studies, and, the, methods, used, and, not, controlling, for, age, or, gender, since, the, risk, is, small, cardiac, screening, programs, for, marathons, are, uncommon, however, this, review, was, not, an, attempt, to, assess, the, overall, cardiac, health, impact, of, marathon, running, a, 2006, study, of, non, elite, boston, marathon, participants, tested, runners, for, certain, proteins, that, indicate, heart, damage, or, dysfunction, see, troponin, and, gave, them, echocardiogram, scans, before, and, after, the, marathon, the, study, revealed, that, in, that, sample, of, 60, people, runners, who, had, averaged, fewer, than, 56, km, 35, mi, of, weekly, training, in, the, 4, months, before, the, race, were, most, likely, to, show, some, heart, damage, or, dysfunction, while, runners, who, had, done, more, than, 72, km, 45, mi, of, weekly, training, showed, few, or, no, heart, problems, according, to, a, canadian, study, presented, in, 2010, running, a, marathon, can, temporarily, result, in, decreased, function, of, more, than, half, the, muscle, segments, in, the, heart, s, main, pumping, chamber, but, neighboring, segments, are, generally, able, to, compensate, full, recovery, is, reached, within, three, months, the, fitter, the, runner, the, less, the, effect, the, runners, with, decreased, left, ventricle, function, had, an, average, peak, weekly, training, distance, of, 55, 1, km, 34, 2, mi, while, those, who, did, not, averaged, 69, 1, km, 42, 9, mi, the, marathon, was, held, in, 35, c, 95, f, weather, according, to, one, of, the, researchers, regular, exercise, reduces, cardiovascular, risk, by, a, factor, of, two, or, three, in, the, long, run, but, while, we, re, doing, vigorous, exercise, such, as, marathon, running, our, cardiac, risk, increases, by, seven, overconsumption, is, the, most, significant, concern, associated, with, water, consumption, during, marathons, drinking, excessive, amounts, of, fluid, during, a, race, can, lead, to, dilution, of, sodium, in, the, blood, a, condition, called, exercise, associated, hyponatremia, which, may, result, in, vomiting, seizures, coma, and, even, death, dr, lewis, g, maharam, medical, director, for, the, new, york, city, marathon, stated, in, 2005, there, are, no, reported, cases, of, dehydration, causing, death, in, the, history, of, world, running, but, there, are, plenty, of, cases, of, people, dying, of, hyponatremia, for, example, dr, cynthia, lucero, died, at, the, age, of, 28, while, participating, in, the, 2002, boston, marathon, it, was, lucero, s, second, marathon, at, mile, 22, lucero, complained, of, feeling, dehydrated, and, rubber, legged, she, soon, wobbled, and, collapsed, to, the, ground, and, was, unconscious, by, the, time, the, paramedics, reached, her, lucero, was, admitted, to, brigham, and, women, s, hospital, and, died, two, days, later, lucero, s, cause, of, death, was, determined, to, be, hyponatremic, encephalopathy, a, condition, that, causes, swelling, of, the, brain, due, to, an, imbalance, of, sodium, in, the, blood, known, as, exercise, associated, hyponatremia, eah, while, eah, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, water, intoxication, lucero, drank, large, amounts, of, gatorade, during, the, race, demonstrating, that, runners, who, consume, sodium, containing, sports, drinks, in, excess, of, thirst, can, still, develop, eah, because, hyponatremia, is, caused, by, excessive, water, retention, and, not, just, loss, of, sodium, consumption, of, sports, drinks, or, salty, foods, may, not, prevent, hyponatremia, women, are, more, prone, to, hyponatremia, than, men, a, study, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, found, that, 13, of, runners, completing, the, 2002, boston, marathon, had, hyponatremia, the, international, marathon, medical, directors, association, immda, advised, in, 2006, that, fluid, intake, should, be, adjusted, individually, according, to, factors, such, as, body, weight, sex, climate, pace, fitness, vo, 2, max, and, sweat, rate, as, fluid, requirements, can, vary, between, people, depending, on, these, variables, the, immda, also, recommended, sports, drinks, that, include, carbohydrates, and, electrolytes, instead, of, plain, water, and, said, that, runners, should, drink, to, thirst, trying, to, refrain, from, drinking, at, every, fluid, station, before, feeling, thirsty, heat, exposure, leads, to, diminished, thirst, drive, and, thirst, may, not, be, a, sufficient, incentive, to, drink, in, many, situations, the, immda, and, hsl, harpur, hill, give, recommendations, to, drink, fluid, in, small, volumes, frequently, at, an, approximate, rate, falling, between, 100, 250, ml, 3, 4, 8, 5, us, fl, oz, every, 15, minutes, a, patient, suffering, hyponatremia, can, be, given, a, small, volume, of, a, concentrated, salt, solution, intravenously, to, raise, sodium, concentrations, in, the, blood, some, runners, weigh, themselves, before, running, and, write, the, results, on, their, bibs, if, anything, goes, wrong, first, aid, workers, can, use, the, weight, information, to, tell, if, the, patient, had, consumed, too, much, water, exertional, heat, stroke, is, an, emergency, condition, in, which, thermoregulation, fails, and, the, body, temperature, rises, dangerously, above, 40, c, 104, f, it, becomes, a, greater, risk, in, warm, and, humid, weather, even, for, young, and, fit, individuals, treatment, requires, rapid, physical, cooling, of, the, body, some, charities, seek, to, associate, with, various, races, some, marathon, organizers, set, aside, a, portion, of, their, limited, entry, slots, for, charity, organizations, to, sell, to, members, in, exchange, for, donations, runners, are, given, the, option, to, sign, up, to, run, particular, races, especially, when, marathon, entries, are, no, longer, available, to, the, general, public, in, some, cases, charities, organize, their, own, marathon, as, a, fund, raiser, gaining, funds, via, entry, fees, or, sponsorships, in, 2015, the, mars, rover, opportunity, attained, the, distance, of, a, marathon, from, its, starting, location, on, mars, and, the, valley, where, it, achieved, this, distance, was, called, marathon, valley, which, was, then, explored, records, lists, related, races,
