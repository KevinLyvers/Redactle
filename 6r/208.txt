the, chair, is, still, used, as, the, emblem, of, authority, in, the, house, of, commons, in, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, and, in, many, other, settings, in, keeping, with, this, historical,

to, as, chairs, it, was, not, until, the, 16th, century, that, chairs, became, common, until, then, people, sat, on, chests, benches, and, stools, which, were, the, ordinary, seats, of, everyday, life, the, number, of, chairs, which, have, survived, from, an, earlier, date, is, exceedingly, limited, most, examples, are, of, ecclesiastical, seigneurial, or, feudal, origin, chairs, were, in, existence, since, at, least, the, early, dynastic, period, of, egypt, c, 3100, bc, they, were, covered, with, cloth, or, leather, were, made, of, carved, wood, and, were, much, lower, than, today, s, chairs, chair, seats, were, sometimes, only, 10, inches, 25, cm, high, in, ancient, egypt, chairs, appear, to, have, been, of, great, richness, and, splendor, fashioned, of, ebony, and, ivory, or, of, carved, and, gilded, wood, they, were, covered, with, costly, materials, magnificent, patterns, and, supported, upon, representations, of, the, legs, of, beasts, or, the, figures, of, captives, generally, speaking, the, higher, ranked, an, individual, was, the, taller, and, more, sumptuous, was, the, chair, he, sat, on, and, the, greater, the, honor, on, state, occasions, the, pharaoh, sat,

outgrowth, of, indigenous, chinese, furniture, that, it, evolved, from, a, camp, stool, imported, from, central, asia, that, it, was, introduced, to, china, by, christian, missionaries, in, the, 7th, century, and, that, the, chair, came, to, china, from, india, as, a, form, of, buddhist, monastic, furniture, in, modern, china, unlike, korea, or, japan, it, is, no, longer, common, to, sit, at, floor, level, in, europe, it, was, owing, in, great, measure, to, the, renaissance, that, the, chair, ceased, to, be, a, privilege, of, state, and, became, a, standard, item, of, furniture, for, anyone, who, could, afford, to, buy, it, once, the, idea, of, privilege, faded, the, chair, speedily, came, into, general, use, almost, at, once, the, chair, began, to, change, every, few, years, to,

hardoy, chair, bean, bags, and, the, egg, shaped, pod, chair, that, turns, it, also, introduced, the, first, mass, produced, plastic, chairs, such, as, the, bofinger, chair, in, 1966, technological, advances, led, to, molded, plywood, and, wood, laminate, chairs, as, well, as, chairs, made, of, leather, or, polymers, mechanical, technology, incorporated, into, the, chair, enabled, adjustable, chairs, especially, for, office, use, motors, embedded, in, the, chair, resulted, in, massage, chairs, chairs, can, be, made, from, wood, metal, or, other, strong, materials, like, stone, or, acrylic, in, some, cases, multiple, materials, are, used, to, construct, a, chair, for, example, the, legs, and, frame, may, be, made, from, metal, and, the, seat, and, back, may, be, made, from, plastic, chairs, may, have, hard, surfaces, of, wood, metal, plastic, or, other, materials, or, some, or, all, of, these, hard, surfaces, may, be, covered, with, upholstery, or, padding, the, design, may, be, made, of, porous, materials, or, be, drilled, with, holes, for, decoration, a, low, back, or, gaps, can, provide, ventilation, the, back, may, extend, above, the, height, of, the, occupant, s, head, which, can, optionally, contain, a, headrest, chairs, can, also, be, made, from, more, creative, materials, such, as, recycled, materials, like, cutlery, and, wooden, play, bricks, pencils, plumbing, tubes, rope, corrugated, cardboard, and, pvc, pipe, in, rare, cases, chairs, are, made, out, of, unusual, materials, especially, as, a, form, of, art, or, experimentation, raimonds, cirulis, a, latvian, interior, designer, created, a, volcanic, hanging, chair, that, is, handmade, out, of, volcanic, rock, peter, brenner, a, dutch, born, german, designer, has, created, a, chair, made, from, lollipop, sugar, 60, pounds, 27, kg, of, confectioners, sugar, chair, design, considers, intended, usage, ergonomics, how, comfortable, it, is, for, the, occupant, as, well, as, non, ergonomic, functional, requirements, such, as, size, stacking, ability, folding, ability, weight, durability, stain, resistance, and, artistic, design, ergonomic, design, distributes, the, weight, of, the, occupant, to, various, parts, of, the, body, this, is, done, by, having, an, easily, adjustable, seat, height, a, seat, that, is, higher, results, in, dangling, feet, and, increased, pressure, on, the, underside, of, the, knees, popliteal, fold, it, may, also, result, in, no, weight, on, the, feet, which, means, more, weight, elsewhere, a, lower, seat, may, shift, too, much, weight, to, the, seat, bones, ischial, tuberosities, gas, springs, are, attached, to, the, body, of, the, chair, in, order, to, give, height, adjustment, and, more, comfort, to, the, user, some, chairs, have, foot, rests, around, 15, of, women, and, 2, of, men, need, foot, rests, even, at, the, 16, inch, 41, cm, chair, height, a, stool, or, other, simple, chair, may, have, a, simple, straight, or, curved, bar, near, the, bottom, for, the, sitter, to, place, their, feet, on, actual, chair, dimensions, are, determined, by, measurements, of, the, human, body, or, anthropometric, measurements, the, two, most, relevant, anthropometric, measurement, for, chair, design, is, the, popliteal, height, and, buttock, popliteal, length, for, someone, seated, the, popliteal, height, is, the, distance, from, the, underside, of, the, foot, to, the, underside, of, the, thigh, at, the, knees, it, is, sometimes, called, the, stool, height, the, term, sitting, height, is, reserved, for, the, height, to, the, top, of, the, head, when, seated, for, american, men, the, median, popliteal, height, is, 16, 3, inches, 41, cm, and, for, american, women, it, is, 15, 0, inches, 38, cm, the, popliteal, height, after, adjusting, for, heels, clothing, and, other, issues, is, used, to, determine, the, height, of, the, chair, seat, mass, produced, chairs, are, typically, 17, inches, 43, cm, high, researchers, such, as, mary, blade, and, galen, cranz, found, that, sitting, on, the, edge, of, a, high, stool, with, feet, on, the, floor, is, less, harmful, for, the, lower, back, than, sitting, up, straight, on, a, conventional, chair, different, types, of, chairs, can, have, a, variety, of, seating, positions, depending, on, the, intended, task, typically, chairs, intended, for, people, completing, work, or, dining, can, only, recline, very, slightly, otherwise, the, occupant, is, too, far, away, from, the, desk, or, table, dental, chairs, are, necessarily, reclined, research, has, shown, that, the, best, seated, posture, is, a, reclined, posture, of, 100, 110, in, order, to, recline, the, back, rest, may, be, independently, adjustable, a, reclining, seat, and, back, will, reduce, the, load, on, the, occupant, s, back, muscles, in, general, if, the, occupant, is, supposed, to, sit, for, a, long, time, weight, needs, to, be, taken, off, the, seat, area, and, thus, easy, chairs, intended, for, long, periods, of, sitting, are, generally, at, least, slightly, reclined, the, back, of, the, chair, will, support, some, of, the, weight, of, the, occupant, reducing, the, weight, on, other, parts, of, the, body, some, back, rests, support, only, the, lumbar, region, while, shoulder, height, back, rests, support, the, entire, back, and, shoulders, headrests, support, the, head, as, well, and, are, important, in, vehicles, for, preventing, whiplash, neck, injuries, in, rear, end, collisions, where, the, head, is, jerked, back, suddenly, reclining, chairs, typically, have, at, least, shoulder, height, back, rests, to, shift, weight, to, the, shoulders, there, may, be, cases, where, padding, is, not, desirable, such, as, chairs, that, are, intended, primarily, for, outdoor, use, where, padding, is, not, desirable, contouring, may, be, used, instead, a, contoured, seat, pan, attempts, to, distribute, weight, without, padding, by, matching, the, shape, of, the, occupant, s, buttocks, weight, is, distributed, and, maximum, pressure, is, reduced, a, chair, may, or, may, not, have, armrests, chairs, with, armrests, are, termed, armchairs, in, french, a, distinction, is, made, between, fauteuil, and, chaise, the, terms, for, chairs, with, and, without, armrests, respectively, in, germany, an, armchair, was, once, called, a, krankensessel, or, sick, chair, because, it, was, intended, for, people, who, were, too, ill, to, stand, or, sit, without, extra, support, if, present, armrests, will, support, part, of, the, body, weight, through, the, arms, if, the, arms, are, resting, on, the, armrests, elbow, rest, height, is, used, to, determine, the, height, of, the, armrests, armrests, should, support, the, forearm, and, not, the, sensitive, elbow, area, hence, in, some, chair, designs, the, armrest, is, not, continuous, to, the, chair, back, but, is, missing, in, the, elbow, area, armrests, further, have, the, function, of, making, entry, and, exit, from, the, chair, easier, but, from, the, side, it, becomes, more, difficult, for, someone, seated, the, buttock, popliteal, length, is, the, horizontal, distance, from, the, back, most, part, of, the, buttocks, to, the, back, of, the, lower, leg, this, anthropometric, measurement, is, used, to, determine, the, seat, depth, mass, produced, chairs, are, typically, 15, 17, inches, 38, 43, cm, deep, additional, anthropometric, measurements, may, be, relevant, to, designing, a, chair, hip, breadth, is, used, for, chair, width, and, armrest, width, the, buttock, knee, length, is, used, to, determine, leg, room, between, rows, of, chairs, seat, pitch, is, the, distance, between, rows, of, seats, in, some, airplanes, and, stadiums, the, leg, room, the, seat, pitch, less, the, thickness, of, the, seat, at, thigh, level, is, so, small, that, it, is, sometimes, insufficient, for, the, average, person, a, wide, variety, of, chairs, have, emerged, throughout, the, ages, some, based, on, formal, usages, and, others, based, on, domestic, needs, and, some, based, on, needs, within, the, workplace, or, various, professions, an, office, chair, is, one, used, by, employees, within, an, office, modern, office, chairs, are, usually, adjustable, and, wheeled, caster, wheels, are, attached, to, the, feet, of, chairs, to, give, more, mobility, a, dining, room, chair, is, a, specific, type, of, design, used, around, a, dining, room, table, it, can, be, found, in, most, ordinary, residential, homes, and, also, may, appear, in, formal, settings, such, as, any, formal, event, or, reception, that, includes, a, formal, meal, or, banquet, a, work, chair, is, a, specialized, chair, adapted, to, the, needs, of, a, particular, profession, or, setting, for, example, a, designing, chair, will, be,

the, legs, they, are, called, rocking, chairs, a, kneeling, chair, adds, an, additional, body, part, the, knees, to, support, the, weight, of, the, body, a, sit, stand, chair, distributes, most, of, the, weight, of, the, occupant, to, the, feet, many, chairs, are, padded, or, have, cushions, padding, can, be, on, the, seat, of, the, chair, only, on, the, seat, and, back, or, also, on, any, arm, rests, or, foot, rest, the, chair, may, have, padding, will, not, shift, the, weight, to, different, parts, of, the, body, unless, the, chair, is, so, soft, that, the, shape, is, altered, however, padding, does, distribute, the, weight, by, increasing, the, area, of, contact, between, the, chair, and, the, body, and, thus, reducing, the, amount, of, pressure, at, any, given, point, by, contrast, a, hard, wood, chair, feels, hard, because, the, contact, point, between, the, occupant, and, the, chair, is, small, in, lieu, of, padding, flexible, materials, such, as, wicker, may, be, used, instead, with, similar, effects, of, distributing, the, weight, chair, seats, vary, widely, in, construction, and, may, or, may, not, match, construction, of, the, chair, s, back, back, rest,
