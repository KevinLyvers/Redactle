baking, is, a, method, of, preparing, food, that, uses, dry, heat, typically, in, an, oven, but, can, also, be, done, in, hot, ashes, or, on, hot, stones, the, most, common, baked, item, is, bread, but, many, other, types, of, foods, can, be, baked, heat, is, gradually, transferred, from, the, surface, of, cakes, cookies, and, pieces, of, bread, to, their, center, typically, conducted, at, elevated, temperatures, surpassing, 300, f, dry, heat, cooking, imparts, a, distinctive, richness, to, foods, through, the, processes, of, caramelization, and, surface, browning, as, heat, travels, through, it, transforms, batters, and, doughs, into, baked, goods, and, more, with, a, firm, dry, crust, and, a, softer, center, baking, can, be, combined, with, grilling, to, produce, a, hybrid, barbecue, variant, by, using, both, methods, simultaneously, or, one, after, the, other, baking, is, related, to, barbecuing, because, the, concept, of, the, masonry, oven, is, similar, to, that, of, a, smoke, pit, baking, has, traditionally, been, performed, at, home, for, day, to, day, meals, and, in, bakeries, and, restaurants, for, local, consumption, when, production, was, industrialized, baking, was, automated, by, machines, in, large, factories, the, art, of, baking, remains, a, fundamental, skill, and, is, important, for, nutrition, as, baked, goods, especially, bread, are, a, common, and, important, food, both, from, an, economic, and, cultural, point, of, view, a, person, who, prepares, baked, goods, as, a, profession, is, called, a, baker, all, types, of, food, can, be, baked, but, some, require, special, care, and, protection, from, direct, heat, various, techniques, have, been, developed, to, provide, this, protection, in, addition, to, bread, baking, is, used, to, prepare, cakes, pastries, pies, tarts, quiches, cookies, scones, crackers, pretzels, and, more, these, popular, items, are, known, collectively, as, baked, goods, and, are, often, sold, at, a, bakery, which, is, a, store, that, carries, only, baked, goods, or, at, markets, grocery, stores, farmers, markets, or, through, other, venues, meat, including, cured, meats, such, as, ham, can, also, be, baked, but, baking, is, usually, reserved, for, meatloaf, smaller, cuts, of, whole, meats, or, whole, meats, that, contain, stuffing, or, coating, such, as, bread, crumbs, or, buttermilk, batter, some, foods, are, surrounded, with, moisture, during, baking, by, placing, a, small, amount, of, liquid, such, as, water, or, broth, in, the, bottom, of, a, closed, pan, and, letting, it, steam, up, around, the, food, roasting, is, a, term, synonymous, with, baking, but, traditionally, denotes, the, cooking, of, whole, animals, or, major, cuts, through, exposure, to, dry, heat, for, instance, one, bakes, chicken, parts, but, roasts, the, whole, bird, one, can, bake, pork, or, lamb, chops, but, roasts, the, whole, loin, or, leg, there, are, many, exceptions, to, this, rule, of, the, two, terms, baking, and, roasting, otherwise, involve, the, same, range, of, cooking, times, and, temperatures, another, form, of, baking, is, the, method, known, as, en, cro, te, french, for, in, crust, referring, to, a, pastry, crust, which, protects, the, food, from, direct, heat, and, seals, the, natural, juices, inside, meat, poultry, game, fish, or, vegetables, can, be, prepared, by, baking, en, cro, te, well, known, examples, include, beef, wellington, where, the, beef, is, encased, in, pastry, before, baking, p, t, en, cro, te, where, the, terrine, is, encased, in, pastry, before, baking, and, the, vietnamese, variant, a, meat, filled, pastry, called, p, t, chaud, the, en, cro, te, method, also, allows, meat, to, be, baked, by, burying, it, in, the, embers, of, a, fire, a, favorite, method, of, cooking, venison, salt, can, also, be, used, to, make, a, protective, crust, that, is, not, eaten, another, method, of, protecting, food, from, the, heat, while, it, is, baking, is, to, cook, it, en, papillote, french, for, in, parchment, in, this, method, the, food, is, covered, by, baking, paper, or, aluminum, foil, to, protect, it, while, it, is, being, baked, the, cooked, parcel, of, food, is, sometimes, served, unopened, allowing, diners, to, discover, the, contents, for, themselves, which, adds, an, element, of, surprise, eggs, can, also, be, used, in, baking, to, produce, savory, or, sweet, dishes, in, combination, with, dairy, products, especially, cheese, they, are, often, prepared, as, a, dessert, for, example, although, a, baked, custard, can, be, made, using, starch, in, the, form, of, flour, cornflour, arrowroot, or, potato, flour, the, flavor, of, the, dish, is, much, more, delicate, if, eggs, are, used, as, the, thickening, agent, baked, custards, such, as, cr, me, caramel, are, among, the, items, that, need, protection, from, an, oven, s, direct, heat, and, the, bain, marie, method, serves, this, purpose, the, cooking, container, is, half, submerged, in, water, in, another, larger, one, so, that, the, heat, in, the, oven, is, more, gently, applied, during, the, baking, process, baking, a, successful, souffl, requires, that, the, baking, process, be, carefully, controlled, the, oven, temperature, must, be, absolutely, even, and, the, oven, space, must, not, be, shared, with, another, dish, these, factors, along, with, the, theatrical, effect, of, an, air, filled, dessert, have, given, this, baked, food, a, reputation, for, being, a, culinary, achievement, similarly, a, good, baking, technique, and, a, good, oven, are, also, needed, to, create, a, baked, alaska, because, of, the, difficulty, of, baking, hot, meringue, and, cold, ice, cream, at, the, same, time, baking, can, also, be, used, to, prepare, other, foods, such, as, pizzas, baked, potatoes, baked, apples, baked, beans, some, casseroles, and, pasta, dishes, such, as, lasagne, the, earliest, known, form, of, baking, occurred, when, humans, took, wild, grass, grains, soaked, them, in, water, and, mashed, the, mixture, into, a, kind, of, broth, like, paste, the, paste, was, cooked, by, pouring, it, onto, a, flat, hot, rock, resulting, in, a, bread, like, substance, later, as, humans, mastered, fire, they, roasted, the, paste, on, hot, embers, making, bread, making, more, convenient, as, it, could, be, done, whenever, fire, was, created, an, oven, discovered, in, croatia, in, 2014, was, estimated, to, date, to, 6500, years, ago, the, ancient, egyptians, baked, bread, using, yeast, which, they, had, previously, been, using, to, brew, beer, bread, baking, began, in, ancient, greece, around, 600, bc, leading, to, the, invention, of, enclosed, ovens, ovens, and, worktables, have, been, discovered, in, archaeological, digs, from, turkey, hacilar, to, palestine, jericho, tell, es, sultan, and, date, back, to, 5600, bc, baking, flourished, during, the, roman, empire, beginning, around, 300, bc, the, pastry, cook, became, an, occupation, for, romans, known, as, the, pastillarium, and, became, a, respected, profession, because, pastries, were, considered, decadent, and, romans, loved, festivity, and, celebration, thus, pastries, were, often, cooked, especially, for, large, banquets, and, any, pastry, cook, who, could, invent, new, types, of, tasty, treats, was, highly, prized, around, 1, ad, there, were, more, than, three, hundred, pastry, chefs, in, rome, and, cato, wrote, about, how, they, created, all, sorts, of, diverse, foods, and, flourished, professionally, and, socially, because, of, their, creations, cato, speaks, of, an, enormous, number, of, breads, including, libum, cakes, made, with, flour, and, honey, often, sacrificed, to, gods, placenta, groats, and, cress, spira, modern, day, flour, pretzels, scibilata, tortes, savillum, sweet, cake, and, globus, apherica, fritters, a, great, selection, of, these, with, many, different, variations, different, ingredients, and, varied, patterns, were, often, found, at, banquets, and, dining, halls, the, romans, baked, bread, in, an, oven, with, its, own, chimney, and, had, mills, to, grind, grain, into, flour, a, bakers, guild, was, established, in, 168, bc, in, rome, eventually, the, roman, art, of, baking, became, known, throughout, europe, and, eventually, spread, to, eastern, parts, of, asia, by, the, 13th, century, in, london, commercial, trading, including, baking, had, many, regulations, attached, in, the, case, of, food, they, were, designed, to, create, a, system, so, there, was, little, possibility, of, false, measures, adulterated, food, or, shoddy, manufactures, there, were, by, that, time, twenty, regulations, applying, to, bakers, alone, including, that, every, baker, had, to, have, the, impression, of, his, seal, upon, bread, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, alternative, leavening, agents, became, more, common, such, as, baking, soda, bakers, often, baked, goods, at, home, and, then, sold, them, in, the, streets, this, scene, was, so, common, that, rembrandt, among, others, painted, a, pastry, chef, selling, pancakes, in, the, streets, of, germany, with, children, clamoring, for, a, sample, in, london, pastry, chefs, sold, their, goods, from, handcarts, this, developed, into, a, delivery, system, of, baked, goods, to, households, and, greatly, increased, demand, as, a, result, in, paris, the, first, open, air, caf, of, baked, goods, was, developed, and, baking, became, an, established, art, throughout, the, entire, world, every, family, used, to, prepare, the, bread, for, its, own, consumption, the, trade, of, baking, not, having, yet, taken, shape, mrs, beeton, 1861, baking, eventually, developed, into, a, commercial, industry, using, automated, machinery, which, enabled, more, goods, to, be, produced, for, widespread, distribution, in, the, united, states, the, baking, industry, was, built, on, marketing, methods, used, during, feudal, times, and, production, techniques, developed, by, the, romans, some, makers, of, snacks, such, as, potato, chips, or, crisps, have, produced, baked, versions, of, their, snack, products, as, an, alternative, to, the, usual, cooking, method, of, deep, frying, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, their, calorie, or, fat, content, baking, has, opened, up, doors, to, businesses, such, as, cake, shops, and, factories, where, the, baking, process, is, done, with, larger, amounts, in, large, open, furnaces, the, aroma, and, texture, of, baked, goods, as, they, come, out, of, the, oven, are, strongly, appealing, but, is, a, quality, that, is, quickly, lost, since, the, flavour, and, appeal, largely, depend, on, freshness, commercial, producers, have, to, compensate, by, using, food, additives, as, well, as, imaginative, labeling, as, more, and, more, baked, goods, are, purchased, from, commercial, suppliers, producers, try, to, capture, that, original, appeal, by, adding, the, label, home, baked, such, attempts, seek, to, make, an, emotional, link, to, the, remembered, freshness, of, baked, goods, as, well, as, to, attach, positive, associations, the, purchaser, has, with, the, idea, of, home, to, the, bought, product, freshness, is, such, an, important, quality, that, restaurants, although, they, are, commercial, and, not, domestic, preparers, of, food, bake, their, own, products, for, example, scones, at, the, ritz, london, hotel, are, not, baked, until, early, afternoon, on, the, day, they, are, to, be, served, to, make, sure, they, are, as, fresh, as, possible, baking, needs, an, enclosed, space, for, heating, typically, in, an, oven, formerly, primitive, clay, ovens, were, in, use, the, fuel, can, be, supplied, by, wood, coal, gas, or, electricity, adding, and, removing, items, from, an, oven, may, be, done, by, hand, with, an, oven, mitt, or, by, a, peel, a, long, handled, tool, specifically, used, for, that, purpose, many, commercial, ovens, are, equipped, with, two, heating, elements, one, for, baking, using, convection, and, thermal, conduction, to, heat, the, food, and, one, for, broiling, or, grilling, heating, mainly, by, radiation, another, piece, of, equipment, still, used, for, baking, is, the, dutch, oven, also, called, a, bake, kettle, bastable, bread, oven, fire, pan, bake, oven, kail, pot, tin, kitchen, roasting, kitchen, doufeu, french, gentle, fire, or, feu, de, compagne, french, country, oven, originally, replaced, the, cooking, jack, as, the, latest, fireside, cooking, technology, combining, the, convenience, of, pot, oven, and, hangover, oven, asian, cultures, have, adopted, steam, baskets, to, produce, the, effect, of, baking, while, reducing, the, amount, of, fat, needed, other, equipment, tools, needed, for, baking, precision, include, a, method, for, measuring, ingredients, ideally, a, scale, accurate, to, the, gram, is, used, as, exact, measurements, provide, the, best, results, but, some, bakers, rely, on, measuring, cups, and, measuring, spoons, digital, kitchen, scales, are, also, popular, in, baking, where, precise, measurements, are, a, must, for, dry, ingredients, eleven, events, occur, concurrently, during, baking, some, of, which, such, as, starch, gelatinization, would, not, occur, at, room, temperature, the, dry, heat, of, baking, changes, the, form, of, starches, in, the, food, and, causes, its, outer, surfaces, to, brown, giving, it, an, attractive, appearance, and, taste, the, browning, is, caused, by, the, caramelization, of, sugars, and, the, maillard, reaction, maillard, browning, occurs, when, sugars, break, down, in, the, presence, of, proteins, because, foods, contain, many, different, types, of, sugars, and, proteins, maillard, browning, contributes, to, the, flavour, of, a, wide, range, of, foods, including, nuts, roast, beef, and, baked, bread, the, moisture, is, never, entirely, sealed, in, over, time, an, item, being, baked, will, become, dry, this, is, often, an, advantage, especially, in, situations, where, drying, is, the, desired, outcome, like, drying, herbs, or, roasting, certain, types, of, vegetables, the, baking, process, does, not, require, any, fat, to, be, used, to, cook, in, an, oven, when, baking, consideration, must, be, given, to, the, amount, of, fat, that, is, contained, in, the, food, item, higher, levels, of, fat, such, as, margarine, butter, lard, or, vegetable, shortening, will, cause, an, item, to, spread, out, during, the, baking, process, with, the, passage, of, time, breads, harden, and, become, stale, this, is, not, primarily, due, to, moisture, being, lost, from, the, baked, products, but, more, a, reorganization, of, the, way, in, which, the, water, and, starch, are, associated, over, time, this, process, is, similar, to, recrystallization, and, is, promoted, by, storage, at, cool, temperatures, such, as, in, a, domestic, refrigerator, or, freezer, baking, especially, of, bread, holds, special, significance, for, many, cultures, it, is, such, a, fundamental, part, of, everyday, food, consumption, that, the, children, s, nursery, rhyme, pat, a, cake, pat, a, cake, baker, s, man, takes, baking, as, its, subject, baked, goods, are, normally, served, at, all, kinds, of, parties, and, special, attention, is, given, to, their, quality, at, formal, events, they, are, also, one, of, the, main, components, of, a, tea, party, including, at, nursery, teas, and, high, teas, a, tradition, which, started, in, victorian, britain, reportedly, when, anna, russell, duchess, of, bedford, grew, tired, of, the, sinking, feeling, which, afflicted, her, every, afternoon, round, 4, o, clock, in, 1840, she, plucked, up, courage, and, asked, for, a, tray, of, tea, bread, and, butter, and, cake, to, be, brought, to, her, room, once, she, had, formed, the, habit, she, found, she, could, not, break, it, so, spread, it, among, her, friends, instead, as, the, century, progressed, afternoon, tea, became, increasingly, elaborate, the, benedictine, sisters, of, the, benedictine, monastery, of, caltanissetta, baked, a, pastry, called, crocetta, of, caltanissetta, cross, of, caltanissetta, they, used, to, be, prepared,
