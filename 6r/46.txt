dieting, is, the, practice, of, eating, food, in, a, regulated, way, to, decrease, maintain, or, increase, body, weight, or, to, prevent, and, treat, diseases, such, as, diabetes, and, obesity, as, weight, loss, depends, on, calorie, intake, different, kinds, of, calorie, reduced, diets, such, as, those, emphasising, particular, macronutrients, low, fat, low, carbohydrate, etc, have, been, shown, to, be, no, more, effective, than, one, another, as, weight, regain, is, common, diet, success, is, best, predicted, by, long, term, adherence, regardless, the, outcome, of, a, diet, can, vary, widely, depending, on, the, individual, the, first, popular, diet, was, banting, named, after, william, banting, in, his, 1863, pamphlet, letter, on, corpulence, addressed, to, the, public, he, outlined, the, details, of, a, particular, low, carbohydrate, low, calorie, diet, that, led, to, his, own, dramatic, weight, loss, some, guidelines, recommend, dieting, to, lose, weight, for, people, with, weight, related, health, problems, but, not, for, otherwise, healthy, people, one, survey, found, that, almost, half, of, all, american, adults, attempt, to, lose, weight, through, dieting, including, 66, 7, of, obese, adults, and, 26, 5, of, normal, weight, or, underweight, adults, dieters, who, are, overweight, but, not, obese, who, are, normal, weight, or, who, are, underweight, may, have, an, increased, mortality, rate, as, a, result, of, dieting, the, word, diet, comes, from, the, greek, diaita, which, represents, a, notion, of, a, whole, way, healthy, lifestyle, including, both, mental, and, physical, health, rather, than, a, narrow, weight, loss, regimen, one, of, the, first, dietitians, was, the, english, doctor, george, cheyne, he, himself, was, tremendously, overweight, and, would, constantly, eat, large, quantities, of, rich, food, and, drink, he, began, a, meatless, diet, taking, only, milk, and, vegetables, and, soon, regained, his, health, he, began, publicly, recommending, his, diet, for, everyone, who, was, obese, in, 1724, he, wrote, an, essay, of, health, and, long, life, in, which, he, advises, exercise, and, fresh, air, and, avoiding, luxury, foods, the, scottish, military, surgeon, john, rollo, published, notes, of, a, diabetic, case, in, 1797, it, described, the, benefits, of, a, meat, diet, for, those, with, diabetes, basing, this, recommendation, on, matthew, dobson, s, discovery, of, glycosuria, in, diabetes, mellitus, by, means, of, dobson, s, testing, procedure, for, glucose, in, the, urine, rollo, worked, out, a, diet, that, had, success, for, what, is, now, called, type, 2, diabetes, the, first, popular, diet, was, banting, named, after, the, english, undertaker, william, banting, in, 1863, he, wrote, a, booklet, called, letter, on, corpulence, addressed, to, the, public, which, contained, the, particular, plan, for, the, diet, he, had, successfully, followed, his, own, diet, was, four, meals, per, day, consisting, of, meat, greens, fruits, and, dry, wine, the, emphasis, was, on, avoiding, sugar, sweet, foods, starch, beer, milk, and, butter, banting, s, pamphlet, was, popular, for, years, to, come, and, would, be, used, as, a, model, for, modern, diets, the, pamphlet, s, popularity, was, such, that, the, question, do, you, bant, referred, to, his, method, and, eventually, to, dieting, in, general, his, booklet, remains, in, print, as, of, 2007, the, first, weight, loss, book, to, promote, calorie, counting, and, the, first, weight, loss, book, to, become, a, bestseller, was, the, 1918, diet, and, health, with, key, to, the, calories, by, american, physician, and, columnist, lulu, hunt, peters, it, was, estimated, that, over, 1000, weight, loss, diets, have, been, developed, up, to, 2014, a, restricted, diet, is, most, commonly, pursued, by, those, who, want, to, lose, weight, some, people, follow, a, diet, to, gain, weight, such, as, people, who, are, underweight, or, who, are, attempting, to, gain, more, muscle, diets, can, also, be, used, to, maintain, a, stable, body, weight, or, to, improve, health, low, fat, diets, involve, the, reduction, of, the, percentage, of, fat, in, one, s, diet, calorie, consumption, is, reduced, because, less, fat, is, consumed, diets, of, this, type, include, ncep, step, i, and, ii, a, meta, analysis, of, 16, trials, of, 2, 12, months, duration, found, that, low, fat, diets, without, intentional, restriction, of, caloric, intake, resulted, in, average, weight, loss, of, 3, 2, kg, 7, 1, lb, over, habitual, eating, a, low, fat, plant, based, diet, has, been, found, to, improve, control, of, weight, blood, sugar, levels, and, cardiovascular, health, low, carbohydrate, diets, restrict, carbohydrate, consumption, relative, to, the, average, diet, foods, high, in, carbohydrates, e, g, sugar, bread, pasta, are, limited, and, replaced, with, foods, containing, a, higher, percentage, of, fat, and, protein, e, g, meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, cheese, nuts, and, seeds, as, well, as, low, carbohydrate, foods, e, g, spinach, kale, chard, collards, and, other, fibrous, vegetables, there, is, a, lack, of, standardization, of, how, much, carbohydrate, low, carbohydrate, diets, must, have, and, this, has, complicated, research, one, definition, from, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, specifies, low, carbohydrate, diets, as, having, less, than, 20, of, calories, from, carbohydrates, there, is, no, good, evidence, that, low, carbohydrate, dieting, confers, any, particular, health, benefits, apart, from, weight, loss, where, low, carbohydrate, diets, achieve, outcomes, similar, to, other, diets, as, weight, loss, is, mainly, determined, by, calorie, restriction, and, adherence, low, calorie, diets, usually, produce, an, energy, deficit, of, 500, 1, 000, calories, per, day, which, can, result, in, a, 0, 5, to, 1, kilogram, 1, 1, to, 2, 2, pounds, weight, loss, per, week, the, national, institutes, of, health, reviewed, 34, randomized, controlled, trials, to, determine, the, effectiveness, of, low, calorie, diets, they, found, that, these, diets, lowered, total, body, mass, by, 8, in, the, short, term, over, 3, 12, months, women, doing, low, calorie, diets, should, have, at, least, 1, 000, calories, per, day, and, men, should, have, approximately, 1, 200, calories, per, day, these, caloric, intake, values, vary, depending, on, additional, factors, such, as, age, and, weight, very, low, calorie, diets, provide, 200, 800, calories, per, day, maintaining, protein, intake, but, limiting, calories, from, both, fat, and, carbohydrates, they, subject, the, body, to, starvation, and, produce, an, average, loss, of, 1, 5, 2, 5, kg, 3, 3, 5, 5, lb, per, week, 2, 4, 6, 8, a, popular, diet, of, this, variety, follows, a, four, day, cycle, in, which, only, 200, calories, are, consumed, the, first, day, 400, the, second, day, 600, the, third, day, 800, the, fourth, day, and, then, totally, fasting, after, which, the, cycle, repeats, there, is, some, evidence, that, these, diets, results, in, considerable, weight, loss, these, diets, are, not, recommended, for, general, use, and, should, be, reserved, for, the, management, of, obesity, as, they, are, associated, with, adverse, side, effects, such, as, loss, of, lean, muscle, mass, increased, risks, of, gout, and, electrolyte, imbalances, people, attempting, these, diets, must, be, monitored, closely, by, a, physician, to, prevent, complications, the, concept, of, crash, dieting, is, to, drastically, reduce, calories, using, a, very, low, calorie, diet, crash, dieting, can, be, highly, dangerous, because, it, can, cause, various, kind, of, issues, for, the, human, body, crash, dieting, can, produce, weight, loss, but, without, professional, supervision, all, along, the, extreme, reduction, in, calories, and, potential, unbalance, in, the, diet, s, composition, can, lead, to, detrimental, effects, including, sudden, death, fasting, is, the, act, of, intentional, taking, a, long, time, interval, between, meals, lengthy, fasting, multiple, days, in, a, week, might, be, dangerous, due, to, the, risk, of, malnutrition, during, prolonged, fasting, or, very, low, calorie, diets, the, reduction, of, blood, glucose, the, preferred, energy, source, of, the, brain, causes, the, body, to, deplete, its, glycogen, stores, once, glycogen, is, depleted, the, body, begins, to, fuel, the, brain, using, ketones, while, also, metabolizing, body, protein, including, but, not, limited, to, skeletal, muscle, to, be, used, to, synthesize, sugars, for, use, as, energy, by, the, rest, of, the, body, most, experts, believe, that, a, prolonged, fast, can, lead, to, muscle, wasting, although, some, dispute, this, the, use, of, short, term, fasting, or, various, forms, of, intermittent, fasting, have, been, used, as, a, form, of, dieting, to, circumvent, the, issues, of, long, fasting, intermittent, fasting, commonly, takes, the, form, of, periodic, fasting, alternate, day, fasting, time, restricted, feeding, and, or, religious, fasting, it, can, be, a, form, of, reduced, calorie, dieting, but, pertains, entirely, to, when, the, metabolism, is, activated, during, the, day, for, digestion, the, changes, to, eating, habits, on, a, regular, basis, do, not, have, to, be, severe, or, absolutely, restrictive, to, see, benefits, to, cardiovascular, health, such, as, improved, glucose, metabolism, reduced, inflammation, and, reduced, blood, pressure, studies, have, suggested, that, for, people, in, intensive, care, an, intermittent, fasting, regimen, might, energy, supply, to, vital, organs, and, tissues, powerfully, activates, cell, protective, and, cellular, repair, pathways, including, autophagy, mitochondrial, biogenesis, and, antioxidant, defenses, which, may, promote, resilience, to, cellular, stress, the, effects, of, decreased, serum, glucose, and, depleted, hepatic, glycogen, causing, the, body, to, switch, to, ketogenic, metabolism, are, similar, to, the, effects, of, reduced, carbohydrate, based, diets, there, is, evidence, demonstrating, profound, metabolic, benefits, of, intermittent, fasting, in, rodents, however, evidence, is, lacking, or, contradictory, in, humans, and, requires, further, investigation, especially, over, the, long, term, some, evidence, suggests, that, intermittent, restriction, of, caloric, intake, has, no, weight, loss, advantages, over, continuous, calorie, restriction, plans, for, adults, fasting, diets, appear, to, be, safe, and, tolerable, however, there, is, a, possibility, that, periods, of, fasting, and, hunger, could, lead, to, overeating, and, to, weight, regain, after, the, fasting, period, adverse, effects, of, fasting, are, often, moderate, and, include, halitosis, fatigue, weakness, and, headaches, fasting, diets, may, be, harmful, to, children, and, the, elderly, this, type, of, diet, is, based, on, the, restriction, of, specific, foods, or, food, groups, examples, include, gluten, free, paleo, plant, based, and, mediterranean, diets, plant, based, diets, include, vegetarian, and, vegan, diets, and, can, range, from, the, simple, exclusion, of, meat, products, to, diets, that, only, include, raw, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and, sprouted, grains, exclusion, of, animal, products, can, reduce, the, intake, of, certain, nutrients, which, might, lead, to, nutritional, deficiencies, of, protein, iron, zinc, calcium, and, vitamins, d, and, b, 12, therefore, long, term, implementation, of, a, plant, based, diet, requires, effective, counseling, and, nutritional, supplementation, as, necessary, plant, based, diets, are, effective, for, short, term, treatment, of, overweight, and, obesity, likely, due, to, the, high, consumption, of, low, energy, density, foods, however, evidence, for, long, term, efficacy, is, limited, the, paleo, diet, includes, foods, that, were, available, to, our, hunter, gatherer, ancestors, including, meat, nuts, eggs, some, oils, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, overall, it, is, high, in, protein, and, moderate, in, fats, and, carbohydrates, some, limited, evidence, suggests, various, health, benefits, and, effective, weight, loss, with, this, diet, however, similar, to, the, plant, based, diet, the, paleo, diet, has, potential, nutritional, deficiency, risks, specifically, with, vitamin, d, calcium, and, iodine, gluten, free, diets, are, often, used, for, weight, loss, but, little, has, been, studied, about, the, efficacy, of, this, diet, and, metabolic, mechanism, for, its, effectiveness, is, unclear, the, mediterranean, diet, is, characterized, by, high, consumption, of, vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole, grain, cereals, seafood, olive, oil, and, nuts, red, meat, dairy, and, alcohol, are, only, recommended, in, moderation, studies, show, that, the, mediterranean, diet, is, associated, with, short, term, as, well, as, long, term, weight, loss, in, addition, to, health, and, metabolic, benefits, detox, diets, are, promoted, with, unsubstantiated, claims, that, they, can, eliminate, toxins, from, the, human, body, many, of, these, diets, use, herbs, or, celery, and, other, juicy, low, calorie, vegetables, detox, diets, can, include, fasting, or, exclusion, as, in, juice, fasting, detox, diets, tend, to, result, in, short, term, weight, loss, because, of, calorie, restriction, followed, by, weight, gain, another, kind, of, diet, focuses, not, on, the, dieter, s, health, effects, but, on, its, environment, the, one, blue, dot, plan, of, the, bda, offers, recommendations, towards, reducing, diets, environmental, impacts, by, several, diets, are, effective, for, short, term, weight, loss, for, obese, individuals, with, diet, success, most, predicted, by, adherence, and, little, effect, resulting, from, the, type, or, brand, of, diet, as, weight, maintenance, depends, on, calorie, intake, diets, emphasising, certain, macronutrients, low, fat, low, carbohydrate, etc, have, been, shown, to, be, no, more, effective, than, one, another, and, no, more, effective, than, diets, that, maintain, a, typical, mix, of, foods, with, smaller, portions, and, perhaps, some, substitutions, e, g, low, fat, milk, or, less, salad, dressing, a, meta, analysis, of, six, randomized, controlled, trials, found, no, difference, between, low, calorie, low, carbohydrate, and, low, fat, diets, in, terms, of, short, term, weight, loss, with, a, 2, 4, kilogram, weight, loss, over, 12, 18, months, in, all, studies, diets, that, severely, restrict, calorie, intake, do, not, lead, to, long, term, weight, loss, extreme, diets, may, in, some, cases, lead, to, malnutrition, a, major, challenge, regarding, weight, loss, and, dieting, relates, to, compliance, while, dieting, can, effectively, promote, weight, loss, in, the, short, term, the, intervention, is, hard, to, maintain, over, time, and, suppresses, skeletal, muscle, thermogenesis, suppressed, thermogenesis, accelerates, weight, regain, once, the, diet, stops, unless, that, phase, is, accompanied, by, a, well, timed, exercise, intervention, as, described, by, the, summermatter, cycle, most, diet, studies, do, not, assess, long, term, weight, loss, some, studies, have, found, that, on, average, short, term, dieting, results, in, a, meaningful, long, term, weight, loss, although, limited, because, of, gradual, 1, to, 2, kg, year, weight, regain, because, people, who, do, not, participate, in, weight, loss, programs, also, tend, to, gain, weight, over, time, and, baseline, data, from, such, untreated, participants, are, typically, not, included, in, diet, studies, it, is, possible, that, diets, do, result, in, lower, weights, in, the, long, term, relative, to, people, who, do, not, diet, others, have, suggested, that, dieting, is, ineffective, as, a, long, term, intervention, for, each, individual, the, results, will, be, different, with, some, even, regaining, more, weight, than, they, lost, while, a, few, others, achieve, a, tremendous, loss, so, that, the, average, weight, loss, of, a, diet, is, not, indicative, of, the, results, other, dieters, may, achieve, a, 2001, meta, analysis, of, 29, american, studies, found, that, participants, of, structured, weight, loss, programs, maintained, an, average, of, 23, 3, kg, of, their, initial, weight, loss, after, five, years, representing, a, sustained, 3, 2, reduction, in, body, mass, unfortunately, patients, are, generally, unhappy, with, weight, loss, of, 10, and, reductions, even, as, high, as, 10, are, insufficient, for, changing, someone, with, an, obese, bmi, to, a, normal, weight, bmi, partly, because, diets, do, not, reliably, produce, long, term, positive, health, outcomes, some, argue, against, using, weight, loss, as, a, goal, preferring, other, measures, of, health, such, as, improvements, in, cardiovascular, biomarkers, sometimes, called, a, health, at, every, size, haes, approach, or, a, weight, neutral, approach, long, term, losses, from, dieting, are, best, maintained, with, continuing, professional, support, long, term, increases, in, physical, activity, the, use, of, anti, obesity, medications, continued, use, of, meal, replacements, and, additional, periods, of, dieting, to, undo, weight, regain, the, most, effective, approach, to, weight, loss, is, an, in, person, high, intensity, comprehensive, lifestyle, intervention, overweight, or, obese, adults, should, maintain, regular, at, least, monthly, contact, with, a, trained, interventionalist, who, can, help, them, engage, in, exercise, monitor, their, body, weight, and, reduce, their, calorie, consumption, even, with, high, intensity, comprehensive, lifestyle, interventions, consisting, of, diet, physical, exercise, and, bimonthly, or, even, more, frequent, contact, with, trained, interventionists, gradual, weight, regain, of, 1, 2, kg, year, still, occurs, for, patients, at, high, medical, risk, bariatric, surgery, or, medications, may, be, warranted, in, addition, to, the, lifestyle, intervention, as, dieting, by, itself, may, not, lead, to, sustained, weight, loss, many, studies, overestimate, the, benefits, of, calorie, restriction, because, the, studies, confound, exercise, and, diet, testing, the, effects, of, diet, and, exercise, as, a, combined, intervention, rather, than, the, effects, of, diet, alone, a, number, of, studies, have, found, that, intentional, weight, loss, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, mortality, in, people, without, weight, related, health, problems, a, 2009, meta, analysis, of, 26, studies, found, that, intentional, weight, loss, had, a, small, benefit, for, individuals, classified, as, unhealthy, with, obesity, related, risk, factors, especially, unhealthy, obese, but, appeared, to, be, associated, with, slightly, increased, mortality, for, healthy, individuals, and, for, those, who, were, overweight, but, not, obese, due, to, extreme, or, unbalanced, diets, dietary, supplements, are, sometimes, taken, in, an, attempt, to, replace, missing, vitamins, or, minerals, while, some, supplements, could, be, helpful, for, people, eating, an, unbalanced, diet, if, replacing, essential, nutrients, for, example, overdosing, on, any, dietary, supplement, can, cause, a, range, of, side, effects, depending, on, the, supplement, and, dose, that, is, taken, supplements, should, not, replace, foods, that, are, important, to, a, healthy, diet, in, an, editorial, for, psychological, medicine, george, hsu, concludes, that, dieting, is, likely, to, lead, to, the, development, of, an, eating, disorder, in, the, presence, of, certain, risk, factors, a, 2006, study, found, that, dieting, and, unhealthy, weight, control, behaviors, were, predictive, of, obesity, and, eating, disorders, five, years, later, with, the, authors, recommending, a, shift, away, from, dieting, and, drastic, weight, control, measures, toward, the, long, term, implementation, of, healthful, eating, and, physical, activity, when, the, body, is, expending, more, energy, than, it, is, consuming, e, g, when, exercising, the, body, s, cells, rely, on, internally, stored, energy, sources, such, as, complex, carbohydrates, and, fats, for, energy, the, first, source, to, which, the, body, turns, is, glycogen, by, glycogenolysis, glycogen, is, a, complex, carbohydrate, 65, of, which, is, stored, in, skeletal, muscles, and, the, remainder, in, the, liver, totaling, about, 2, 000, kcal, in, the, whole, body, it, is, created, from, the, excess, of, ingested, macronutrients, mainly, carbohydrates, when, glycogen, is, nearly, depleted, the, body, begins, lipolysis, the, mobilization, and, catabolism, of, fat, stores, for, energy, in, this, process, fats, obtained, from, adipose, tissue, or, fat, cells, are, broken, down, into, glycerol, and, fatty, acids, which, can, be, used, to, generate, energy, the, primary, by, products, of, metabolism, are, carbon, dioxide, and, water, carbon, dioxide, is, expelled, through, the, respiratory, system, the, set, point, theory, first, introduced, in, 1953, postulated, that, each, body, has, a, preprogrammed, fixed, weight, with, regulatory, mechanisms, to, compensate, this, theory, was, quickly, adopted, and, used, to, explain, failures, in, developing, effective, and, sustained, weight, loss, procedures, a, 2019, systematic, review, of, multiple, weight, change, procedures, including, alternate, day, fasting, and, time, restricted, feeding, but, also, exercise, and, overeating, found, systematic, energetic, errors, for, all, these, procedures, this, shows, that, the, body, cannot, precisely, compensate, for, errors, in, energy, calorie, intake, countering, the, set, point, theory, and, potentially, explaining, both, weight, loss, and, weight, gain, such, as, obesity, this, review, was, conducted, on, short, term, studies, therefore, such, a, mechanism, cannot, be, excluded, in, the, long, term, as, evidence, is, currently, lacking, on, this, timeframe, a, meal, timing, schedule, is, known, to, be, an, important, factor, of, any, diet, recent, evidence, suggest, that, new, scheduling, strategies, such, as, intermittent, fasting, or, skipping, meals, and, strategically, placed, snacks, before, meals, may, be, recommendable, to, reduce, cardiovascular, risks, as, part, of, a, broader, lifestyle, and, dietary, change, a, 2008, study, published, in, the, american, journal, of, preventive, medicine, showed, that, dieters, who, kept, a, daily, food, diary, or, diet, journal, lost, twice, as, much, weight, as, those, who, did, not, keep, a, food, log, suggesting, that, if, a, person, records, their, eating, they, are, more, aware, of, what, they, consume, and, therefore, eat, fewer, calories, a, 2009, review, found, limited, evidence, suggesting, that, encouraging, water, consumption, and, substituting, energy, free, beverages, for, energy, containing, beverages, i, e, reducing, caloric, intake, may, facilitate, weight, management, a, 2009, article, found, that, drinking, 500, ml, of, water, prior, to, meals, for, a, 12, week, period, resulted, in, increased, long, term, weight, reduction, references, given, in, main, article, it, is, estimated, that, about, 1, out, of, 3, americans, is, dieting, at, any, given, time, 85, of, dieters, are, women, approximately, sixty, billion, dollars, are, spent, every, year, in, the, usa, on, diet, products, including, diet, foods, such, as, light, sodas, gym, memberships, or, specific, regimes, 80, of, dieters, start, by, themselves, whereas, 20, see, a, professional, or, join, a, paid, program, the, typical, dieter, attempts, 4, tries, per, year, some, weight, loss, groups, aim, to, make, money, others, work, as, charities, the, former, include, weight, watchers, and, peertrainer, the, latter, include, overeaters, anonymous, tops, club, and, groups, run, by, local, organizations, these, organizations, customs, and, practices, differ, widely, some, groups, are, modelled, on, twelve, step, programs, while, others, are, quite, informal, some, groups, advocate, certain, prepared, foods, or, special, menus, while, others, train, dieters, to, make, healthy, choices, from, restaurant, menus, and, while, grocery, shopping, and, cooking, attending, group, meetings, for, weight, reduction, programmes, rather, than, receiving, one, on, one, support, may, increase, the, likelihood, that, obese, people, will, lose, weight, those, who, participated, in, groups, had, more, treatment, time, and, were, more, likely, to, lose, enough, weight, to, improve, their, health, study, authors, suggested, that, one, explanation, for, the, difference, is, that, group, participants, spent, more, time, with, the, clinician, or, whoever, delivered, the, programme, than, those, receiving, one, on, one, support
