alpine, skiing, or, downhill, skiing, is, the, pastime, of, sliding, down, snow, covered, slopes, on, skis, with, fixed, heel, bindings, unlike, other, types, of, skiing, cross, country, telemark, or, ski, jumping, which, use, skis, with, free, heel, bindings, whether, for, recreation, or, for, sport, it, is, typically, practiced, at, ski, resorts, which, provide, such, services, as, ski, lifts, artificial, snow, making, snow, grooming, restaurants, and, ski, patrol, off, piste, skiers, those, skiing, outside, ski, area, boundaries, may, employ, snowmobiles, helicopters, or, snowcats, to, deliver, them, to, the, top, of, a, slope, back, country, skiers, may, use, specialized, equipment, with, a, free, heel, mode, including, sticky, skins, on, the, bottoms, of, the, skis, to, stop, them, sliding, backwards, during, an, ascent, then, locking, the, heel, and, removing, the, skins, for, their, descent, alpine, ski, racing, has, been, held, at, the, winter, olympics, since, 1936, a, competition, corresponding, to, modern, slalom, was, introduced, in, norway, at, oslo, in, 1886, as, of, 2023, there, were, estimated, to, be, 55, million, people, worldwide, who, engaged, in, alpine, skiing, the, estimated, number, of, skiers, who, practiced, alpine, cross, country, skiing, and, related, snow, sports, amounted, to, 30, million, in, europe, 20, million, in, north, america, and, 14, million, in, japan, as, of, 1996, there, were, reportedly, 4, 500, ski, areas, operating, 26, 000, ski, lifts, and, enjoying, skier, visits, the, predominant, region, for, downhill, skiing, was, europe, followed, by, japan, and, the, us, the, ancient, origins, of, skiing, can, be, traced, back, to, prehistoric, times, in, russia, finland, sweden, and, norway, where, varying, sizes, and, shapes, of, wooden, planks, were, found, preserved, in, peat, bogs, the, word, ski, is, related, to, the, old, norse, word, sk, which, means, split, piece, of, wood, or, firewood, skis, were, first, invented, to, cross, wetlands, and, marshes, in, the, winter, when, they, froze, over, skiing, was, an, integral, part, of, transportation, in, colder, countries, for, thousands, of, years, in, the, 1760s, skiing, was, recorded, as, being, used, in, military, training, the, norwegian, army, held, skill, competitions, involving, skiing, down, slopes, around, trees, and, obstacles, while, shooting, the, birth, of, modern, alpine, skiing, is, often, dated, to, the, 1850s, and, during, the, late, 19th, century, skiing, was, adapted, from, a, method, of, transportation, to, a, competitive, and, recreational, sport, norwegian, legend, sondre, norheim, first, began, the, trend, of, skis, with, curved, sides, and, bindings, with, stiff, heel, bands, made, of, willow, norheim, also, trended, the, slalom, turn, style, the, wooden, skis, designed, by, norheim, closely, resemble, the, shape, of, modern, slalom, skis, norheim, was, the, champion, of, the, first, downhill, skiing, competition, reportedly, held, in, oslo, norway, in, 1868, norheim, impressed, spectators, when, he, used, the, stem, christie, in, christiania, oslo, in, 1868, the, technique, was, originally, called, christiania, turn, norwegian, christianiasving, or, kristianiasving, after, the, city, first, printed, in, 1901, in, guidelines, for, ski, jumping, the, telemark, turn, was, the, alternative, technique, the, christiania, turn, later, developed, into, parallel, turn, as, the, standard, technique, in, alpine, skiing, the, term, slalom, is, from, norwegian, dialects, slal, m, meaning, a, trail, l, m, on, a, slope, sla, in, telemark, in, the, 1800s, the, steeper, and, more, difficult, trails, were, called, ville, l, mir, wild, trails, skiing, competitions, in, telemark, often, began, on, a, steep, mountain, continued, along, a, logging, slides, t, mmerslepe, and, was, completed, with, a, sharp, turn, telemark, turn, on, a, field, or, frozen, lake, this, type, of, competition, used, the, natural, and, typical, terrain, in, telemark, some, races, were, on, bumpy, courses, kneikel, m, and, sometimes, included, steep, jumps, spr, ytehopp, for, difficulty, the, first, known, slalom, competitions, were, presumably, held, in, telemark, around, 1870, in, conjunction, with, ski, jumping, competitions, involving, the, same, athletes, and, on, slopes, next, to, the, ski, jump, husebyrennet, from, 1886, included, svingrenn, turning, competition, on, hills, the, term, slal, m, had, not, been, introduced, at, that, time, slalom, was, first, used, at, a, skiing, competition, in, sonnenberg, in, 1906, two, to, three, decades, later, the, sport, spread, to, the, rest, of, europe, and, the, us, the, first, slalom, ski, competition, occurred, in, m, rren, switzerland, in, 1922, a, skier, following, the, fall, line, will, reach, the, maximum, possible, speed, for, that, slope, a, skier, with, skis, pointed, perpendicular, to, the, fall, line, across, the, hill, instead, of, down, it, will, accelerate, more, slowly, the, speed, of, descent, down, any, given, hill, can, be, controlled, by, changing, the, angle, of, motion, in, relation, to, the, fall, line, skiing, across, the, hill, rather, than, down, it, downhill, skiing, technique, focuses, on, the, use, of, turns, to, smoothly, turn, the, skis, from, one, direction, to, another, additionally, the, skier, can, use, the, same, techniques, to, turn, the, ski, away, from, the, direction, of, movement, generating, skidding, forces, between, the, skis, and, snow, which, further, slow, the, descent, good, technique, results, in, a, fluid, flowing, motion, from, one, descent, angle, to, another, one, adjusting, the, angle, as, needed, to, match, changes, in, the, steepness, of, the, run, this, looks, more, like, a, single, series, of, s, s, than, turns, followed, by, straight, sections, the, oldest, and, still, common, type, of, turn, on, skis, is, the, stem, angling, the, tail, of, the, ski, off, to, the, side, while, the, tips, remain, close, together, in, doing, so, the, snow, resists, passage, of, the, stemmed, ski, creating, a, force, that, retards, downhill, speed, and, sustains, a, turn, in, the, opposite, direction, when, both, skis, are, stemmed, there, is, no, net, turning, force, only, retardation, of, downhill, speed, carving, is, based, on, the, shape, of, the, ski, itself, when, the, ski, is, rotated, onto, its, edge, the, pattern, cut, into, its, side, causes, it, to, bend, into, an, arc, the, contact, between, the, arc, of, the, ski, edges, and, the, snow, naturally, causes, the, ski, to, tend, to, move, along, that, arc, changing, the, skiers, direction, of, motion, this, is, an, advanced, form, of, speed, control, by, increasing, the, pressure, on, one, inside, edge, for, example, the, right, ski, then, releasing, the, pressure, and, shifting, immediately, to, increasing, the, other, inside, edge, the, left, ski, then, repeat, if, necessary, each, increased, pressure, slows, the, speed, alternating, right, and, left, allows, the, skis, to, remain, parallel, and, point, ahead, without, turning, the, increase, and, release, sequence, results, in, the, up, and, down, motions, of, the, upper, body, some, skiers, go, down, the, top, of, moguls, and, control, the, speed, by, checking, at, the, tops, this, is, how, they, can, practically, go, straight, down, the, fall, line, without, gaining, speed, the, snowplough, turn, is, the, simplest, form, of, turning, and, is, usually, learned, by, beginners, to, perform, the, snowplough, turn, one, must, be, in, the, snowplough, position, while, going, down, the, ski, slope, while, doing, this, they, apply, more, pressure, to, the, inside, of, the, opposite, foot, of, which, the, direction, they, would, like, to, turn, this, type, of, turn, allows, the, skier, to, keep, a, controlled, speed, and, introduces, the, idea, of, turning, across, the, fall, line, modern, alpine, skis, are, shaped, to, enable, carve, turning, and, have, evolved, significantly, since, the, 1980s, with, variants, including, powder, skis, freestyle, skis, all, mountain, skis, and, children, s, skis, powder, skis, are, usually, used, when, there, is, a, large, amount, of, fresh, snow, the, shape, of, a, powder, ski, is, wide, allowing, the, ski, to, float, on, top, of, the, snow, compared, to, a, normal, downhill, ski, which, would, most, likely, sink, into, the, snow, freestyle, skis, are, used, by, skiers, who, ski, terrain, parks, these, skis, are, meant, to, help, a, skier, who, skis, jumps, rails, and, other, features, placed, throughout, the, terrain, park, freestyle, skis, are, usually, fully, symmetric, meaning, they, are, the, same, dimensions, from, the, tip, of, the, ski, to, the, backside, tail, of, the, ski, all, mountain, skis, are, the, most, common, type, of, ski, and, tend, to, be, used, as, a, typical, alpine, ski, all, mountain, skis, are, built, to, do, a, little, bit, of, everything, they, can, be, used, in, fresh, snow, powder, or, used, when, skiing, groomed, runs, slalom, race, skis, usually, referred, to, as, race, skis, are, short, narrow, skis, which, tend, to, be, stiffer, because, they, are, meant, for, those, who, want, to, go, fast, as, well, as, make, quick, sharp, turns, the, binding, is, a, device, used, to, connect, the, skier, s, boot, to, the, ski, the, purpose, of, the, binding, is, to, allow, the, skier, to, stay, connected, to, the, ski, but, if, the, skier, falls, the, binding, can, safely, release, them, from, the, ski, to, prevent, injury, there, are, two, types, of, bindings, the, heel, and, toe, system, step, in, and, the, plate, system, binding, ski, boots, are, one, of, the, most, important, accessories, to, skiing, they, connect, the, skier, to, the, skis, allowing, them, full, control, over, the, ski, when, ski, boots, first, came, about, they, were, made, of, leather, and, laces, were, used, the, leather, ski, boots, started, off, as, low, cut, but, gradually, became, taller, allowing, for, more, ankle, support, as, injuries, became, more, common, eventually, the, tied, laces, were, replaced, with, buckles, and, the, leather, boots, were, replaced, with, plastic, this, allowed, the, bindings, to, be, more, closely, matched, to, the, fit, of, the, boot, and, offer, improved, performance, the, new, plastic, model, contained, two, parts, of, the, boots, an, inner, boot, and, an, outer, shell, the, inner, part, of, the, boot, also, called, the, liner, is, the, cushioning, part, of, the, boot, and, contains, a, footbed, along, with, a, cushion, to, keep, a, skier, s, foot, warm, and, comfortable, the, outer, shell, is, the, part, of, the, boot, that, is, made, of, plastic, and, contains, the, buckles, most, ski, boots, contain, a, strap, at, shin, level, to, allow, for, extra, strength, when, tightening, the, boots, ski, poles, one, in, each, hand, are, used, for, balance, and, propulsion, ski, helmets, reduce, the, chances, of, head, injury, while, skiing, ski, helmets, also, help, to, provide, warmth, to, the, head, since, they, incorporate, an, inner, liner, that, traps, warmth, helmets, are, available, in, many, styles, and, typically, consist, of, a, hard, plastic, resin, shell, with, inner, padding, modern, ski, helmets, may, include, many, additional, features, such, as, vents, earmuffs, headphones, goggle, mounts, and, camera, mounts, the, protective, gear, used, in, alpine, skiing, includes, helmets, mouth, guards, shin, guards, chin, guards, arm, guards, back, protectors, pole, guards, and, padding, mouth, guards, can, reduce, the, effects, of, a, concussion, and, protect, the, teeth, of, the, athlete, shin, guards, pole, guards, arm, guards, and, chin, guards, are, mainly, used, in, slalom, skiing, in, order, to, protect, the, body, parts, having, impact, with, the, gates, back, protectors, and, padding, also, known, as, stealth, is, worn, for, giant, slalom, and, other, speed, events, in, order, to, better, protect, the, body, if, an, athlete, were, to, have, an, accident, at, high, speeds, elite, competitive, skiers, participate, in, the, fis, world, cup, the, world, championships, and, the, winter, olympics, broadly, speaking, competitive, skiing, is, divided, into, two, disciplines, other, disciplines, administered, by, the, fis, but, not, usually, considered, part, of, alpine, are, speed, skiing, and, grass, skiing, in, most, ski, resorts, the, runs, are, graded, according, to, comparative, difficulty, so, that, skiers, can, select, appropriate, routes, the, grading, schemes, around, the, world, are, related, although, with, significant, regional, variations, a, beginner, rated, trail, at, a, large, mountain, may, be, more, of, an, intermediate, rated, trail, on, a, smaller, mountain, in, the, united, states, and, canada, there, are, four, rating, symbols, easy, green, circle, intermediate, blue, square, and, difficult, black, diamond, and, experts, only, double, black, diamond, ski, trail, difficulty, is, measured, by, percent, slope, not, degree, angle, a, 100, slope, is, a, 45, degree, angle, in, general, beginner, slopes, green, circle, are, between, 6, and, 25, intermediate, slopes, blue, square, are, between, 25, and, 40, difficult, slopes, black, diamond, are, 40, and, up, although, slope, gradient, is, the, primary, consideration, in, assigning, a, trail, difficulty, rating, other, factors, come, into, play, a, trail, will, be, rated, by, its, most, difficult, part, even, if, the, rest, of, the, trail, is, easy, ski, resorts, assign, ratings, to, their, own, trails, rating, a, trail, compared, only, with, other, trails, at, that, resort, also, considered, are, width, of, the, trail, sharpest, turns, terrain, roughness, and, whether, the, resort, regularly, grooms, the, trail, in, 2014, there, were, more, than, 114, 000, alpine, skiing, related, injuries, treated, in, hospitals, doctor, s, offices, and, emergency, rooms, the, most, common, types, of, ski, injuries, are, those, of, the, knee, head, neck, and, shoulder, area, hands, and, back, ski, helmets, are, highly, recommended, by, professionals, as, well, as, doctors, head, injuries, caused, in, skiing, can, lead, to, death, or, permanent, brain, damage, in, alpine, skiing, for, every, 1000, people, skiing, in, a, day, on, average, between, two, and, four, will, require, medical, attention, most, accidents, are, the, result, of, user, error, leading, to, an, isolated, fall, learning, how, to, fall, correctly, and, safely, can, reduce, the, risk, of, injury, according, to, a, 2004, harvard, medical, school, study, alpine, skiing, burns, between, 360, and, 532, calories, per, hour, winter, season, lengths, are, projected, to, decline, at, ski, areas, across, north, america, and, europe, due, to, the, effects, of, global, warming, in, the, united, states, winter, season, lengths, are, projected, to, decline, by, more, than, 50, percent, by, 2050, and, by, 80, percent, by, 2090, if, greenhouse, gas, emissions, continue, at, current, rates, about, half, of, the, 103, ski, resorts, in, the, northeastern, united, states, operating, in, 2012, may, not, be, able, to, maintain, an, economically, viable, ski, season, by, 2050, in, europe, half, of, the, glacial, ice, in, the, alps, has, melted, and, the, european, geosciences, union, projects, snowpack, in, the, mountains, could, decline, 70, percent, by, 2100, however, if, humans, manage, to, keep, global, warming, below, 2, c, the, snow, cover, reduction, would, be, limited, to, 30, percent, by, 2100
