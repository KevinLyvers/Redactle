fencing, is, a, combat, sport, that, features, sword, fighting, the, three, disciplines, of, modern, fencing, are, the, foil, the, p, e, and, the, sabre, also, saber, each, discipline, uses, a, different, kind, of, blade, which, shares, the, same, name, and, employs, its, own, rules, most, competitive, fencers, specialise, in, one, discipline, the, modern, sport, gained, prominence, near, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, is, based, on, the, traditional, skill, set, of, swordsmanship, the, italian, school, altered, the, historical, european, martial, art, of, classical, fencing, and, the, french, school, later, refined, that, system, scoring, points, in, a, fencing, competition, is, done, by, making, contact, with, an, opponent, the, 1904, olympics, games, featured, a, fourth, discipline, of, fencing, known, as, singlestick, but, it, was, dropped, after, that, year, and, is, not, a, part, of, modern, fencing, competitive, fencing, was, one, of, the, first, sports, to, be, featured, in, the, olympics, and, along, with, athletics, cycling, swimming, and, gymnastics, has, been, featured, in, every, modern, olympics, fencing, is, governed, by, the, f, d, ration, internationale, d, escrime, fie, headquartered, in, lausanne, switzerland, the, fie, is, composed, of, 155, national, federations, each, of, which, is, recognised, by, its, state, olympic, committee, as, the, sole, representative, of, olympic, style, fencing, in, that, country, the, fie, maintains, the, current, rules, used, by, major, international, events, including, world, cups, world, championships, and, the, olympic, games, the, fie, handles, proposals, to, change, the, rules, at, an, annual, congress, in, fencing, a, bout, consists, of, a, set, number, of, hits, or, a, certain, duration, depending, on, the, format, of, the, competition, university, students, compete, internationally, at, the, world, university, games, the, united, states, holds, two, national, level, university, tournaments, the, ncaa, championship, and, the, usacfc, national, championships, the, bucs, holds, fencing, tournaments, in, the, united, kingdom, many, universities, in, ontario, canada, have, fencing, teams, that, participate, in, an, annual, inter, university, competition, called, the, oua, finals, national, fencing, organisations, have, set, up, programmes, to, encourage, more, students, to, fence, examples, include, the, regional, youth, circuit, program, in, the, us, and, the, leon, paul, youth, development, series, in, the, uk, the, uk, hosts, two, national, competitions, in, which, schools, compete, against, each, other, directly, the, public, schools, fencing, championship, a, competition, only, open, to, independent, schools, and, the, scottish, secondary, schools, championships, open, to, all, secondary, schools, in, scotland, it, contains, both, teams, and, individual, events, and, is, highly, anticipated, schools, organise, matches, directly, against, one, another, and, school, age, pupils, can, compete, individually, in, the, british, youth, championships, in, recent, years, attempts, have, been, made, to, introduce, fencing, to, a, wider, and, younger, audience, by, using, foam, and, plastic, swords, which, require, much, less, protective, equipment, this, makes, it, much, less, expensive, to, provide, classes, and, thus, easier, to, take, fencing, to, a, wider, range, of, schools, than, traditionally, has, been, the, case, there, is, even, a, competition, series, in, scotland, the, plastic, and, foam, fencing, funleague, specifically, for, primary, and, early, secondary, school, age, children, using, this, equipment, fencing, traces, its, roots, to, the, development, of, swordsmanship, for, duels, and, self, defence, described, as, high, speed, chess, each, bout, begins, and, ends, with, a, salute, good, sportsmanship, and, honor, are, stressed, at, every, level, of, training, and, competition, the, oldest, surviving, treatise, on, western, fencing, is, the, royal, armouries, ms, i, 33, also, known, as, the, tower, manuscript, written, c, 1300, in, present, day, germany, which, discusses, the, usage, of, the, arming, sword, together, with, the, buckler, it, was, followed, by, a, number, of, treatises, primarily, from, germany, and, italy, with, the, oldest, surviving, italian, treatise, being, fior, di, battaglia, by, fiore, dei, liberi, written, c, 1400, however, because, they, were, written, for, the, context, of, a, knightly, duel, with, a, primary, focus, on, archaic, weapons, such, as, the, arming, sword, longsword, or, poleaxe, these, older, treatises, do, not, really, stand, in, continuity, with, modern, fencing, from, the, 16th, century, onward, the, italian, school, of, fencing, would, be, dominated, by, the, bolognese, or, dardi, school, of, fencing, named, after, its, founder, filippo, dardi, a, bolognese, fencing, master, and, professor, of, geometry, at, the, university, of, bologna, unlike, the, previous, traditions, the, bolognese, school, would, primarily, focus, on, the, sidesword, being, either, used, alone, or, in, combination, with, a, buckler, a, cape, a, parrying, dagger, or, dual, wielded, with, another, sidesword, though, some, bolognese, masters, such, as, achille, marozo, would, still, cover, the, usage, of, the, two, handed, greatsword, or, spadone, the, bolognese, school, would, eventually, spread, outside, of, italy, and, lay, the, foundation, for, modern, fencing, eclipsing, both, older, italian, and, german, traditions, this, was, partially, due, to, the, german, schools, focus, on, archaic, weapons, such, as, the, longsword, but, also, due, to, a, general, decline, in, fencing, within, germany, the, mechanics, of, modern, fencing, originated, in, the, 18th, century, in, an, italian, school, of, fencing, of, the, renaissance, and, under, their, influence, were, improved, by, the, french, school, of, fencing, the, spanish, school, of, fencing, stagnated, and, was, replaced, by, the, italian, and, french, schools, the, shift, towards, fencing, as, a, sport, rather, than, as, military, training, happened, from, the, mid, 18th, century, and, was, led, by, domenico, angelo, who, established, a, fencing, academy, angelo, s, school, of, arms, in, carlisle, house, soho, london, in, 1763, there, he, taught, the, aristocracy, the, fashionable, art, of, swordsmanship, his, school, was, run, by, three, generations, of, his, family, and, dominated, the, art, of, european, fencing, for, almost, a, century, he, established, the, essential, rules, of, posture, and, footwork, that, still, govern, modern, sport, fencing, although, his, attacking, and, parrying, methods, were, still, much, different, from, current, practice, although, he, intended, to, prepare, his, students, for, real, combat, he, was, the, first, fencing, master, to, emphasise, the, health, and, sporting, benefits, of, fencing, more, than, its, use, as, a, killing, art, particularly, in, his, influential, book, l, cole, des, armes, the, school, of, fencing, published, in, 1763, basic, conventions, were, collated, and, set, down, during, the, 1880s, by, the, french, fencing, master, camille, pr, vost, it, was, during, this, time, that, many, officially, recognised, fencing, associations, began, to, appear, in, different, parts, of, the, world, such, as, the, amateur, fencers, league, of, america, was, founded, in, 1891, the, amateur, fencing, association, of, great, britain, in, 1902, and, the, f, d, ration, nationale, des, soci, t, s, d, escrime, et, salles, d, armes, de, france, in, 1906, the, first, regularised, fencing, competition, was, held, at, the, inaugural, grand, military, tournament, and, assault, at, arms, in, 1880, held, at, the, royal, agricultural, hall, in, islington, in, june, the, tournament, featured, a, series, of, competitions, between, army, officers, and, soldiers, each, bout, was, fought, for, five, hits, and, the, foils, were, pointed, with, black, to, aid, the, judges, the, amateur, gymnastic, fencing, association, drew, up, an, official, set, of, fencing, regulations, in, 1896, fencing, was, part, of, the, olympic, games, in, the, summer, of, 1896, sabre, events, have, been, held, at, every, summer, olympics, foil, events, have, been, held, at, every, summer, olympics, except, 1908, p, e, events, have, been, held, at, every, summer, olympics, except, in, the, summer, of, 1896, because, of, unknown, reasons, starting, with, p, e, in, 1933, side, judges, were, replaced, by, the, laurent, pagan, electrical, scoring, apparatus, with, an, audible, tone, and, a, red, or, green, light, indicating, when, a, touch, landed, foil, was, automated, in, 1956, sabre, in, 1988, the, scoring, box, reduced, the, bias, in, judging, and, permitted, more, accurate, scoring, of, faster, actions, lighter, touches, and, more, touches, to, the, back, and, flank, than, before, each, of, the, three, weapons, in, fencing, has, its, own, rules, and, strategies, the, foil, is, a, light, thrusting, weapon, with, a, maximum, weight, of, 500, grams, the, foil, targets, the, torso, but, not, the, arms, or, legs, the, foil, has, a, small, circular, hand, guard, that, serves, to, protect, the, hand, from, direct, stabs, as, the, hand, is, not, a, valid, target, in, foil, this, is, primarily, for, safety, touches, are, scored, only, with, the, tip, hits, with, the, side, of, the, blade, do, not, register, on, the, electronic, scoring, apparatus, and, do, not, halt, the, action, touches, that, land, outside, the, target, area, called, an, off, target, touch, and, signalled, by, a, distinct, color, on, the, scoring, apparatus, stop, the, action, but, are, not, scored, only, a, single, touch, can, be, awarded, to, either, fencer, at, the, end, of, a, phrase, if, both, fencers, land, touches, within, 300, ms, 25, ms, tolerance, to, register, two, lights, on, the, machine, the, referee, uses, the, rules, of, right, of, way, to, determine, which, fencer, is, awarded, the, touch, or, if, an, off, target, hit, has, priority, over, a, valid, hit, in, which, case, no, touch, is, awarded, if, the, referee, is, unable, to, determine, which, fencer, has, right, of, way, no, touch, is, awarded, the, p, e, is, a, thrusting, weapon, like, the, foil, but, heavier, with, a, maximum, total, weight, of, 775, grams, in, p, e, the, entire, body, is, a, valid, target, the, hand, guard, on, the, p, e, is, a, large, circle, that, extends, towards, the, pommel, effectively, covering, the, hand, which, is, a, valid, target, in, p, e, like, foil, all, hits, must, be, with, the, tip, and, not, the, sides, of, the, blade, hits, with, the, side, of, the, blade, do, not, register, on, the, electronic, scoring, apparatus, and, do, not, halt, the, action, as, the, entire, body, is, a, legal, target, there, is, no, concept, of, an, off, target, touch, except, if, the, fencer, accidentally, strikes, the, floor, setting, off, the, light, and, tone, on, the, scoring, apparatus, unlike, foil, and, sabre, p, e, does, not, use, right, of, way, simultaneous, touches, to, both, fencers, known, as, double, touches, however, if, the, score, is, tied, in, a, match, at, the, last, point, and, a, double, touch, is, scored, the, point, is, null, and, void, the, sabre, is, a, light, cutting, and, thrusting, weapon, that, targets, the, entire, body, above, the, waist, including, the, head, and, both, the, hands, sabre, is, the, newest, weapon, to, be, used, like, the, foil, the, maximum, legal, weight, of, a, sabre, is, 500, grams, the, hand, guard, on, the, sabre, extends, from, hilt, to, the, point, at, which, the, blade, connects, to, the, pommel, this, guard, is, generally, turned, outwards, during, sport, to, protect, the, sword, arm, from, touches, hits, with, the, entire, blade, or, point, are, valid, as, in, foil, touches, that, land, outside, the, target, area, are, not, scored, however, unlike, foil, these, off, target, touches, do, not, stop, the, action, and, the, fencing, continues, in, the, case, of, both, fencers, landing, a, scoring, touch, the, referee, determines, which, fencer, receives, the, point, for, the, action, again, through, the, use, of, right, of, way, most, personal, protective, equipment, for, fencing, is, made, of, tough, cotton, or, nylon, kevlar, was, added, to, top, level, uniform, pieces, jacket, breeches, underarm, protector, lam, and, the, bib, of, the, mask, following, the, death, of, vladimir, smirnov, at, the, 1982, world, championships, in, rome, however, kevlar, is, degraded, by, both, ultraviolet, light, and, chlorine, which, can, complicate, cleaning, other, ballistic, fabrics, such, as, dyneema, have, been, developed, that, resist, puncture, and, which, do, not, degrade, the, way, that, kevlar, does, fie, rules, state, that, tournament, wear, must, be, made, of, fabric, that, resists, a, force, of, 800, newtons, 180, lb, f, and, that, the, mask, bib, must, resist, twice, that, amount, the, complete, fencing, kit, includes, traditionally, the, fencer, s, uniform, is, white, and, an, instructor, s, uniform, is, black, this, may, be, due, to, the, occasional, pre, electric, practice, of, covering, the, point, of, the, weapon, in, dye, soot, or, coloured, chalk, in, order, to, make, it, easier, for, the, referee, to, determine, the, placing, of, the, touches, as, this, is, no, longer, a, factor, in, the, electric, era, the, fie, rules, have, been, relaxed, to, allow, coloured, uniforms, save, black, the, guidelines, also, limit, the, permitted, size, and, positioning, of, sponsorship, logos, some, pistol, grips, used, by, foil, and, p, e, fencers, a, set, of, electric, fencing, equipment, is, required, to, participate, in, electric, fencing, electric, equipment, in, fencing, varies, depending, on, the, weapon, with, which, it, is, used, in, accordance, the, main, component, of, a, set, of, electric, equipment, is, the, body, cord, the, body, cord, serves, as, the, connection, between, a, fencer, and, a, reel, of, wire, that, is, part, of, a, system, for, electrically, detecting, that, the, weapon, has, touched, the, opponent, there, are, two, types, one, for, p, e, and, one, for, foil, and, sabre, p, e, body, cords, consist, of, two, sets, of, three, prongs, each, connected, by, a, wire, one, set, plugs, into, the, fencer, s, weapon, with, the, other, connecting, to, the, reel, foil, and, sabre, body, cords, have, only, two, prongs, or, a, twist, lock, bayonet, connector, on, the, weapon, side, with, the, third, wire, connecting, instead, to, the, fencer, s, lam, the, need, in, foil, and, sabre, to, distinguish, between, on, and, off, target, touches, requires, a, wired, connection, to, the, valid, target, area, a, body, cord, consists, of, three, wires, known, as, the, a, b, and, c, lines, at, the, reel, connector, and, both, connectors, for, p, e, cords, the, b, pin, is, in, the, middle, the, a, pin, is, 1, 5, cm, to, one, side, of, b, and, the, c, pin, is, 2, cm, to, the, other, side, of, b, this, asymmetrical, arrangement, ensures, that, the, cord, cannot, be, plugged, in, the, wrong, way, around, in, foil, the, a, line, is, connected, to, the, lam, and, the, b, line, runs, up, a, wire, to, the, tip, of, the, weapon, the, b, line, is, normally, connected, to, the, c, line, through, the, tip, when, the, tip, is, depressed, the, circuit, is, broken, and, one, of, three, things, can, happen, in, p, e, the, a, and, b, lines, run, up, separate, wires, to, the, tip, there, is, no, lam, when, the, tip, is, depressed, it, connects, the, a, and, b, lines, resulting, in, a, valid, touch, however, if, the, tip, is, touching, the, opponents, weapon, their, c, line, or, the, grounded, strip, nothing, happens, when, it, is, depressed, as, the, current, is, redirected, to, the, c, line, grounded, strips, are, particularly, important, in, p, e, as, without, one, a, touch, to, the, floor, registers, as, a, valid, touch, rather, than, off, target, as, in, foil, in, sabre, similarly, to, foil, the, a, line, is, connected, to, the, lam, but, both, the, b, and, c, lines, are, connected, to, the, body, of, the, weapon, any, contact, between, one, s, b, c, line, either, one, as, they, are, always, connected, and, the, opponent, s, a, line, their, lam, results, in, a, valid, touch, there, is, no, need, for, grounded, strips, in, sabre, as, hitting, something, other, than, the, opponent, s, lame, does, nothing, in, a, professional, fencing, competition, a, complete, set, of, electric, equipment, is, needed, a, complete, set, of, foil, electric, equipment, includes, the, electric, equipment, of, sabre, is, very, similar, to, that, of, foil, in, addition, equipment, used, in, sabre, includes, p, e, fencers, lack, a, lam, conductive, bib, and, head, cord, due, to, their, target, area, also, their, body, cords, are, constructed, differently, as, described, above, however, they, possess, all, of, the, other, components, of, a, foil, fencer, s, equipment, techniques, or, movements, in, fencing, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, offensive, and, defensive, some, techniques, can, fall, into, both, categories, e, g, the, beat, certain, techniques, are, used, offensively, with, the, purpose, of, landing, a, hit, on, one, s, opponent, while, holding, the, right, of, way, foil, and, sabre, others, are, used, defensively, to, protect, against, a, hit, or, obtain, the, right, of, way, the, attacks, and, defences, may, be, performed, in, countless, combinations, of, feet, and, hand, actions, for, example, fencer, a, attacks, the, arm, of, fencer, b, drawing, a, high, outside, parry, fencer, b, then, follows, the, parry, with, a, high, line, riposte, fencer, a, expecting, that, then, makes, his, own, parry, by, pivoting, his, blade, under, fencer, b, s, weapon, from, straight, out, to, more, or, less, straight, down, putting, fencer, b, s, tip, off, target, and, fencer, a, now, scoring, against, the, low, line, by, angulating, the, hand, upwards, other, variants, include, wheelchair, fencing, for, those, with, disabilities, chair, fencing, one, hit, p, e, one, of, the, five, events, which, constitute, modern, pentathlon, and, the, various, types, of, non, olympic, competitive, fencing, chair, fencing, is, similar, to, wheelchair, fencing, but, for, the, able, bodied, the, opponents, set, up, opposing, chairs, and, fence, while, seated, all, the, usual, rules, of, fencing, are, applied, an, example, of, the, latter, is, the, american, fencing, league, distinct, from, the, united, states, fencing, association, the, format, of, competitions, is, different, and, the, right, of, way, rules, are, interpreted, in, a, different, way, in, a, number, of, countries, school, and, university, matches, deviate, slightly, from, the, fie, format, a, variant, of, the, sport, using, toy, lightsabers, earned, national, attention, when, espn2, acquired, the, rights, to, a, selection, of, matches, and, included, it, as, part, of, its, espn8, the, ocho, programming, block, in, august, 2018, two, handed, fencing, refers, to, a, type, of, fencing, where, a, buckler, or, dagger, is, used, to, parry, attacks, one, of, the, most, notable, films, related, to, fencing, is, the, 2015, finnish, estonian, german, film, the, fencer, directed, by, klaus, h, r, which, is, loosely, based, on, the, life, of, endel, nelis, an, accomplished, estonian, fencer, and, coach, the, film, was, nominated, for, the, 73rd, golden, globe, awards, in, the, best, foreign, language, film, category, in, 2017, the, first, issue, of, the, fence, comic, book, series, which, follows, a, fictional, team, of, young, fencers, was, published, by, the, us, based, boom, studios
