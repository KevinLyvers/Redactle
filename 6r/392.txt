the, long, jump, is, a, track, and, field, event, in, which, athletes, combine, speed, strength, and, agility, in, an, attempt, to, leap, as, far, as, possible, from, a, takeoff, point, along, with, the, triple, jump, the, two, events, that, measure, jumping, for, distance, as, a, group, are, referred, to, as, the, horizontal, jumps, this, event, has, a, history, in, the, ancient, olympic, games, and, has, been, a, modern, olympic, event, for, men, since, the, first, olympics, in, 1896, and, for, women, since, 1948, at, the, elite, level, competitors, run, down, a, runway, usually, coated, with, the, same, rubberized, surface, as, running, tracks, crumb, rubber, or, vulcanized, rubber, known, generally, as, an, all, weather, track, and, jump, as, far, as, they, can, from, a, wooden, or, synthetic, board, 20, centimetres, or, 8, inches, wide, that, is, built, flush, with, the, runway, into, a, pit, filled, with, soft, damp, sand, if, the, competitor, starts, the, leap, with, any, part, of, the, foot, past, the, foul, line, the, jump, is, declared, a, foul, and, no, distance, is, recorded, to, detect, this, occurrence, a, layer, of, plasticine, is, placed, at, a, 90, angle, immediately, after, the, board, an, official, similar, to, a, referee, will, also, watch, the, jump, and, make, the, determination, in, recent, times, laser, sensors, and, high, speed, cameras, have, replaced, the, plasticine, at, elite, competitions, like, diamond, league, meetings, the, competitor, can, initiate, the, jump, from, any, point, behind, the, foul, line, however, the, distance, measured, will, always, be, perpendicular, to, the, foul, line, to, the, nearest, break, in, the, sand, caused, by, any, part, of, the, body, or, uniform, therefore, it, is, in, the, best, interest, of, the, competitor, to, get, as, close, to, the, foul, line, as, possible, competitors, are, allowed, to, place, two, marks, along, the, side, of, the, runway, in, order, to, assist, them, to, jump, accurately, at, a, lesser, meet, and, facilities, the, plasticine, will, likely, not, exist, the, runway, might, be, a, different, surface, or, jumpers, may, initiate, their, jump, from, a, painted, or, taped, mark, on, the, runway, at, a, smaller, meet, the, number, of, attempts, might, also, be, limited, to, four, or, three, each, competitor, has, a, set, number, of, attempts, that, would, normally, be, three, trials, with, three, additional, jumps, being, awarded, to, the, best, eight, or, nine, depending, on, the, number, of, lanes, on, the, track, at, that, facility, so, the, event, is, equatable, to, track, events, competitors, all, valid, attempts, will, be, recorded, but, only, the, best, mark, counts, towards, the, results, the, competitor, with, the, longest, valid, jump, from, either, the, trial, or, final, rounds, is, declared, the, winner, at, the, end, of, competition, in, the, event, of, an, exact, tie, then, comparing, the, next, best, jumps, of, the, tied, competitors, will, be, used, to, determine, place, in, a, large, multi, day, elite, competition, like, the, olympics, or, world, championships, a, qualification, is, held, in, order, to, select, at, least, 12, finalists, ties, and, automatic, qualifying, distances, are, potential, factors, in, the, final, a, set, of, trial, round, jumps, will, be, held, with, the, best, eight, performers, advancing, to, the, final, rounds, for, specific, rules, and, regulations, in, united, states, track, field, see, rule, 185, for, record, purposes, the, maximum, accepted, wind, assistance, is, two, metres, per, second, 4, 5, mph, the, long, jump, is, the, only, known, jumping, event, of, ancient, greece, s, original, olympics, pentathlon, events, all, events, that, occurred, at, the, olympic, games, were, initially, supposed, to, act, as, a, form, of, training, for, warfare, the, long, jump, emerged, probably, because, it, mirrored, the, crossing, of, obstacles, such, as, streams, and, ravines, after, investigating, the, surviving, depictions, of, the, ancient, event, it, is, believed, that, unlike, the, modern, event, athletes, were, only, allowed, a, short, running, start, the, athletes, carried, a, weight, in, each, hand, which, were, called, halteres, between, 1, and, 4, 5, kg, these, weights, were, swung, forward, as, the, athlete, jumped, in, order, to, increase, momentum, it, was, commonly, believed, that, the, jumper, would, throw, the, weights, behind, him, in, midair, to, increase, his, forward, momentum, however, halteres, were, held, throughout, the, duration, of, the, jump, swinging, them, down, and, back, at, the, end, of, the, jump, would, change, the, athlete, s, center, of, gravity, and, allow, the, athlete, to, stretch, his, legs, outward, increasing, his, distance, the, jump, itself, was, made, from, the, bater, that, which, is, trod, upon, it, was, most, likely, a, simple, board, placed, on, the, stadium, track, which, was, removed, after, the, event, the, jumpers, would, land, in, what, was, called, a, skamma, dug, up, area, the, idea, that, this, was, a, pit, full, of, sand, is, wrong, sand, in, the, jumping, pit, is, a, modern, invention, the, skamma, was, simply, a, temporary, area, dug, up, for, that, occasion, and, not, something, that, remained, over, time, the, long, jump, was, considered, one, of, the, most, difficult, of, the, events, held, at, the, games, since, a, great, deal, of, skill, was, required, music, was, often, played, during, the, jump, and, philostratus, says, that, pipes, at, times, would, accompany, the, jump, so, as, to, provide, a, rhythm, for, the, complex, movements, of, the, halteres, by, the, athlete, philostratus, is, quoted, as, saying, the, rules, regard, jumping, as, the, most, difficult, of, the, competitions, and, they, allow, the, jumper, to, be, given, advantages, in, rhythm, by, the, use, of, the, flute, and, in, weight, by, the, use, of, the, halter, most, notable, in, the, ancient, sport, was, a, man, called, chionis, who, in, the, 656, bc, olympics, staged, a, jump, of, 7, 05, m, 23, ft, 1, 1, 2, in, there, has, been, some, argument, by, modern, scholars, over, the, long, jump, some, have, attempted, to, recreate, it, as, a, triple, jump, the, images, provide, the, only, evidence, for, the, action, so, it, is, more, well, received, that, it, was, much, like, today, s, long, jump, the, main, reason, some, want, to, call, it, a, triple, jump, is, the, presence, of, a, source, that, claims, there, once, was, a, fifty, five, ancient, foot, jump, done, by, a, man, named, phayllos, the, long, jump, has, been, part, of, modern, olympic, competition, since, the, inception, of, the, games, in, 1896, in, 1914, dr, harry, eaton, stewart, recommended, the, running, broad, jump, as, a, standardized, track, and, field, event, for, women, however, it, was, not, until, 1948, that, the, women, s, long, jump, was, added, to, the, olympic, athletics, programme, there, are, five, main, components, of, the, long, jump, the, approach, run, the, last, two, strides, takeoff, action, in, the, air, and, landing, speed, in, the, run, up, or, approach, and, a, high, leap, off, the, board, are, the, fundamentals, of, success, because, speed, is, such, an, important, factor, of, the, approach, it, is, not, surprising, that, many, long, jumpers, also, compete, successfully, in, sprints, classic, examples, of, this, long, jump, sprint, doubling, are, performances, by, carl, lewis, and, heike, drechsler, the, objective, of, the, approach, is, to, gradually, accelerate, to, a, maximum, controlled, speed, at, takeoff, the, most, important, factor, for, the, distance, travelled, by, an, object, is, its, velocity, at, takeoff, both, the, speed, and, angle, elite, jumpers, usually, leave, the, ground, at, an, angle, of, 20, or, less, therefore, it, is, more, beneficial, for, a, jumper, to, focus, on, the, speed, component, of, the, jump, the, greater, the, speed, at, takeoff, the, longer, the, trajectory, of, the, center, of, mass, will, be, the, importance, of, takeoff, speed, is, a, factor, in, the, success, of, sprinters, in, this, event, the, length, of, the, approach, is, usually, consistent, distance, for, an, athlete, approaches, can, vary, between, 12, and, 19, steps, on, the, novice, and, intermediate, levels, while, at, the, elite, level, they, are, closer, to, between, 20, and, 22, steps, the, exact, distance, and, number, of, steps, in, an, approach, depends, on, the, jumper, s, experience, sprinting, technique, and, conditioning, level, consistency, in, the, approach, is, important, as, it, is, the, competitor, s, objective, to, get, as, close, to, the, front, of, the, takeoff, board, as, possible, without, crossing, the, line, with, any, part, of, the, foot, the, objective, of, the, last, two, steps, is, to, prepare, the, body, for, takeoff, while, conserving, as, much, speed, as, possible, the, penultimate, step, is, longer, than, the, previous, ones, and, than, the, final, one, before, takeoff, the, competitor, begins, to, lower, his, or, her, center, of, gravity, to, prepare, the, body, for, the, vertical, impulse, the, last, step, is, shorter, because, the, body, is, beginning, to, raise, the, center, of, gravity, in, preparation, for, takeoff, the, last, two, steps, are, extremely, important, because, they, determine, the, velocity, at, which, the, competitor, will, enter, the, jump, the, objective, of, the, takeoff, is, to, create, a, vertical, impulse, through, the, athlete, s, center, of, gravity, while, maintaining, balance, and, control, this, phase, is, one, of, the, most, technical, parts, of, the, long, jump, jumpers, must, be, conscious, to, place, the, foot, flat, on, the, ground, because, jumping, off, either, the, heels, or, the, toes, negatively, affects, the, jump, taking, off, from, the, board, heel, first, has, a, braking, effect, which, decreases, velocity, and, strains, the, joints, jumping, off, the, toes, decreases, stability, putting, the, leg, at, risk, of, buckling, or, collapsing, from, underneath, the, jumper, while, concentrating, on, foot, placement, the, athlete, must, also, work, to, maintain, proper, body, position, keeping, the, torso, upright, and, moving, the, hips, forward, and, up, to, achieve, the, maximum, distance, from, board, contact, to, foot, release, there, are, four, main, styles, of, takeoff, the, double, arm, style, the, kick, style, the, power, sprint, or, bounding, takeoff, and, the, sprint, takeoff, the, double, arm, style, of, takeoff, works, by, moving, both, arms, in, a, vertical, direction, as, the, competitor, takes, off, this, produces, a, high, hip, height, and, a, large, vertical, impulse, the, kick, style, takeoff, is, where, the, athlete, actively, cycles, the, leg, before, a, full, impulse, has, been, directed, into, the, board, then, landing, into, the, pit, this, requires, great, strength, in, the, hamstrings, this, causes, the, jumper, to, jump, to, large, distances, the, power, sprint, takeoff, or, bounding, takeoff, is, one, of, the, more, common, elite, styles, very, similar, to, the, sprint, style, the, body, resembles, a, sprinter, in, full, stride, however, there, is, one, major, difference, the, arm, that, pushes, back, on, takeoff, the, arm, on, the, side, of, the, takeoff, leg, fully, extends, backward, rather, than, remaining, at, a, bent, position, this, additional, extension, increases, the, impulse, at, takeoff, the, sprint, takeoff, is, the, style, most, widely, instructed, by, coaching, staff, this, is, a, classic, single, arm, action, that, resembles, a, jumper, in, full, stride, it, is, an, efficient, takeoff, style, for, maintaining, velocity, through, takeoff, the, correct, style, of, takeoff, will, vary, from, athlete, to, athlete, there, are, three, major, flight, techniques, for, the, long, jump, the, hang, the, hitch, kick, and, the, sail, each, technique, is, to, combat, the, forward, rotation, experienced, from, take, off, but, is, basically, down, to, preference, from, the, athlete, once, the, body, is, airborne, there, is, nothing, that, the, athlete, can, do, to, change, the, direction, they, are, traveling, and, consequently, where, they, are, going, to, land, in, the, pit, however, certain, techniques, influence, an, athlete, s, landing, which, can, affect, the, distance, measured, for, example, if, an, athlete, lands, feet, first, but, falls, back, because, they, are, not, correctly, balanced, a, lower, distance, will, be, measured, following, the, pivotal, takeoff, phase, the, jumper, executes, a, deliberate, maneuver, wherein, the, free, leg, descends, until, it, aligns, directly, beneath, the, hips, this, strategic, positioning, characterized, by, an, elongated, and, streamlined, body, silhouette, is, meticulously, crafted, to, minimize, rotational, forces, by, maximizing, the, distance, between, both, the, arm, and, leg, extremities, and, the, hips, the, theoretical, center, of, mass, the, rotational, inertia, is, significantly, increased, leveraging, the, principle, that, longer, levers, rotate, at, a, slower, pace, than, shorter, ones, this, configuration, facilitates, a, controlled, and, stable, aerial, trajectory, as, the, free, leg, descends, to, meet, the, takeoff, leg, forming, an, angle, of, 180, relative, to, the, ground, a, symmetrical, alignment, is, achieved, with, both, knees, positioned, directly, beneath, the, hips, this, alignment, marks, the, apex, of, stability, during, the, airborne, phase, as, minimal, rotational, tendencies, are, manifested, this, aerodynamically, advantageous, posture, colloquially, termed, the, 180, position, epitomizes, the, pinnacle, of, equilibrium, affording, the, jumper, enhanced, control, and, poise, amidst, the, dynamic, forces, encountered, in, flight, in, the, realm, of, athletic, performance, particularly, in, the, domain, of, jumping, techniques, a, prevalent, strategy, observed, among, practitioners, involves, the, utilization, of, a, single, step, arm, and, leg, cycle, this, technique, ingrained, within, the, repertoire, of, many, athletes, serves, a, fundamental, purpose, to, mitigate, and, alleviate, the, forward, rotation, momentum, experienced, during, the, jump, characterized, by, a, deliberate, and, synchronized, motion, of, the, arms, and, legs, this, cycling, maneuver, is, strategically, devised, to, offset, the, rotational, forces, generated, at, the, moment, of, takeoff, central, to, the, efficacy, of, this, technique, is, its, capacity, to, orchestrate, secondary, rotations, of, both, the, upper, and, lower, extremities, thereby, fostering, a, mechanical, equilibrium, that, counterbalances, the, initial, rotational, impulses, triggered, upon, liftoff, by, implementing, this, methodological, approach, athletes, can, harness, the, principles, of, biomechanics, to, optimize, their, jumping, performance, enhancing, stability, control, and, overall, efficiency, in, their, aerial, endeavors, this, nuanced, understanding, underscores, the, intricate, interplay, between, physics, and, human, kinetics, illuminating, the, sophisticated, strategies, employed, by, athletes, to, excel, in, their, athletic, pursuits, the, sail, technique, represents, a, fundamental, long, jump, approach, widely, employed, by, athletes, in, competitive, settings, following, the, culmination, of, the, takeoff, phase, practitioners, swiftly, elevate, their, legs, into, a, configuration, aimed, at, touching, the, toes, this, maneuver, serves, as, an, entry, level, strategy, particularly, beneficial, for, novice, jumpers, facilitating, an, early, transition, into, the, landing, posture, however, despite, its, utility, in, expediting, the, landing, process, this, technique, fails, to, mitigate, the, inherent, forward, rotational, momentum, of, the, body, effectively, consequently, while, advantageous, for, its, simplicity, and, expedited, landing, preparation, the, sail, technique, lacks, the, requisite, mechanisms, to, adequately, counteract, excessive, forward, rotation, posing, a, notable, limitation, to, its, effectiveness, in, optimizing, jump, performance, in, the, 1970s, some, jumpers, used, a, forward, somersault, including, tuariki, delamere, who, used, it, at, the, 1974, ncaa, championships, and, who, matched, the, jump, of, the, then, olympic, champion, randy, williams, the, somersault, jump, has, potential, to, produce, longer, jumps, than, other, techniques, because, in, the, flip, no, power, is, lost, countering, forward, momentum, and, it, reduces, wind, resistance, in, the, air, the, front, flip, jump, was, subsequently, banned, for, fear, that, it, was, unsafe, the, men, s, long, jump, world, record, has, been, held, by, just, four, individuals, for, the, majority, of, time, since, the, iaaf, started, to, ratify, records, the, first, mark, recognized, by, the, iaaf, in, 1912, the, 7, 61, m, 24, ft, 11, 1, 2, in, performance, by, peter, o, connor, in, august, 1901, stood, just, short, of, 20, years, nine, years, as, an, iaaf, record, after, it, was, broken, in, 1921, the, record, changed, hands, five, times, until, jesse, owens, set, the, mark, of, 8, 13, m, 26, ft, 8, in, at, the, 1935, big, ten, track, meet, in, ann, arbor, michigan, a, record, that, was, not, broken, for, over, 25, years, until, 1960, by, ralph, boston, boston, improved, upon, it, and, exchanged, records, with, igor, ter, ovanesyan, three, times, over, the, next, seven, years, at, the, 1968, summer, olympics, bob, beamon, jumped, 8, 90, m, 29, ft, 2, 1, 4, in, at, an, altitude, of, 2, 292, m, 7, 520, ft, a, record, jump, not, exceeded, for, almost, 23, years, and, which, remains, the, second, longest, wind, legal, jump, of, all, time, it, has, now, stood, as, the, olympic, record, for, over, 55, years, on, 30, august, 1991, mike, powell, of, the, united, states, set, the, current, men, s, world, record, at, the, world, championships, in, tokyo, it, was, in, a, dramatic, showdown, against, carl, lewis, who, also, surpassed, beamon, s, record, that, day, but, his, jump, was, wind, assisted, and, thus, not, legal, for, record, purposes, powell, s, record, of, 8, 95, m, 29, ft, 4, 1, 4, in, has, now, stood, for, over, 33, years, some, jumps, over, 8, 95, m, 29, ft, 4, 1, 4, in, have, been, officially, recorded, wind, assisted, 8, 99, m, 29, ft, 5, 3, 4, in, were, recorded, by, powell, at, high, altitude, in, sestriere, in, 1992, a, potential, world, record, of, 8, 96, m, 29, ft, 4, 3, 4, in, was, recorded, by, iv, n, pedroso, also, in, sestriere, despite, a, legal, wind, reading, the, jump, was, not, validated, because, videotape, revealed, a, person, standing, in, front, of, the, wind, gauge, invalidating, the, reading, and, costing, pedroso, a, ferrari, valued, at, 130, 000, the, prize, for, breaking, the, record, at, that, meet, as, mentioned, above, lewis, jumped, 8, 91, m, 29, ft, 2, 3, 4, in, moments, before, powell, s, record, breaking, jump, with, the, wind, exceeding, the, maximum, allowed, this, jump, remains, the, longest, ever, not, to, win, an, olympic, or, world, championship, gold, medal, or, any, competition, in, general, the, women, s, world, record, has, seen, more, consistent, improvement, though, the, current, record, has, stood, longer, than, any, other, long, jump, world, record, by, men, or, women, the, longest, to, hold, the, record, prior, was, by, fanny, blankers, koen, during, world, war, ii, who, held, it, for, over, 10, years, there, have, been, four, occasions, when, the, record, was, tied, and, three, when, it, was, improved, upon, twice, in, the, same, competition, the, current, women, s, world, record, is, held, by, galina, chistyakova, of, the, former, soviet, union, who, leapt, 7, 52, m, 24, ft, 8, in, in, leningrad, on, 11, june, 1988, a, mark, that, has, now, stood, for, over, 36, years, tables, show, data, for, two, definitions, of, top, 25, the, top, 25, distances, and, the, top, 25, athletes,
