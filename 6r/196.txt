more, and, more, common, adoption, in, the, united, states, is, common, and, relatively, easy, from, a, legal, point, of, view, compared, to, other, western, countries, in, 2001, with, over, 127, 000,

performing, these, tasks, from, older, female, relatives, such, as, mothers, in, law, or, their, own, mothers, regarding, women, in, the, workforce, mothers, are, said, to, often, follow, a, mommy, track, rather, than, being, entirely, career, women, mothers, may, be, stay, at, home, mothers, or, working, mothers, in, recent, decades, there, has, been, an, increase, in, stay, at, home, fathers, too, social, views, on, these, arrangements, vary, significantly, by, culture, in, europe, for, instance, in, german, speaking, countries, there, is, a, strong, tradition, of, mothers, exiting, the, workforce, and, being, homemakers, mothers, have, historically, fulfilled, the, primary, role, in, raising, children, but, since, the, late, 20th, century, the, role, of, the, father, in, child, care, has, been, given, greater, prominence, and, social, acceptance, in, some, western, countries, the, 20th, century, also, saw, more, and, more, women, entering, paid, work, mothers, rights, within, the, workforce, include, maternity, leave, and, parental, leave, the, social, role, and, experience, of, motherhood, varies, greatly, depending, upon, location, mothers, are, more, likely, than, fathers,

changes, in, the, social, meaning, of, motherhood, this, is, however, a, position, highly, biased, by, western, world, locality, outside, the, western, world, in, vitro, fertilization, has, far, less, prominence, importance, or, currency, compared, to, primary, basic, healthcare, women, s, basic, health, reducing, infant, mortality, and, the, prevention, of, life, threatening, diseases, such, as, polio, typhus, and, malaria, traditionally, and, still, in, most, parts, of, the, world, today, a, mother, was, expected, to, be, a, married, woman, with, birth, outside, of, marriage, carrying, a, strong, social, stigma, historically, this, stigma, not, only, applied, to, the, mother, but, also, to, her, child, this, continues, to, be, the, case, in, many, parts, of, the, developing, world, today, but, in, many, western, countries, the, situation, has, changed, radically, with, single, motherhood, being, much, more, socially, acceptable, now, for, more, details, on, these, subjects, see,

organization, save, the, children, has, ranked, the, countries, of, the, world, and, found, that, scandinavian, countries, are, the, safest, places, to, give, birth, whereas, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, are, the, least, safe, to, give, birth, this, study, argues, a, mother, in, the, bottom, ten, ranked, countries, is, over, 750, times, more, likely, to, die, in, pregnancy, or, childbirth, compared, to, a, mother, in, the, top, ten, ranked, countries, and, a, mother, in, the, bottom, ten, ranked, countries, is, 28, times, more, likely, to, see, her, child, die, before, reaching, their, first, birthday, the, most, recent, data, suggests, that, italy, sweden, and, luxembourg, are, the, safest, countries, in, terms, of, maternal, death, and, afghanistan, central, african, republic, and, malawi, are, the, most, dangerous, childbirth, can, be, a, dangerous, process, in, the, absence, of, effective, measures, to, reduce, death, when, none, of, these, measure, are, taken, the, maternal, death, rate, has, been, estimated, as, being, within, the, order, of, magnitude, of, 1, 500, deaths, per, 100, 000, births, modern, medicine, has, greatly, alleviated, the, risk, of, childbirth, in, modern, western, countries, the, current, maternal, mortality, rate, is, around, 10, deaths, per, 100, 000, births, nearly, all, world, religions, define, tasks, or, roles, for, mothers, through, either, religious, law, or, through, the, glorification, of, mothers, who, served, in, substantial, religious, events, there, are, many, examples, of, religious, law, relating, to, mothers, and, women, major, world, religions, which, have, specific, religious, law, or, religious, texts, that, comment, on, mothers, include, christianity, judaism, and, islam, some, examples, of, honoring, motherhood, include, the, veneration, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, as, mother, of, god, and, the, multiple, positive, references, to, active, womanhood, as, a, mother, in, the, book,

works, depicting, motherhood, in, western, art, history, have, been, created, by, artists, who, are, men, with, very, few, having, been, created, by, women, or, mothers, themselves, and, these, often, focus, on, the, institution, of, motherhood, rather, than, diverse, lived, experiences, at, the, same, time, art, concerning, motherhood, has, been, historically, marginalized, within, the, feminist, art, movement, though, this, is, changing, with, an, increasing, number, of, feminist, publications, addressing, this, topic, the, institution, of, motherhood, in, western, art, is, often, depicted, through, the, myth, of, the, all, loving, all, forgiving, and, all, sacrificing, mother, and, related, ideals, examples, include, works, featuring, the, virgin, mary, an, archetypal, mother, and, a, key, historical, basis, for, depictions, of, mothers, in, western, art, from, the, european, renaissance, onwards, mothers, depicted, in, dominant, art, works, are, also, primarily, white,
