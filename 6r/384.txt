running, is, a, method, of, terrestrial, locomotion, by, which, humans, and, other, animals, move, rapidly, on, foot, running, is, a, gait, with, an, aerial, phase, in, which, all, feet, are, above, the, ground, though, there, are, exceptions, this, is, in, contrast, to, walking, where, one, foot, is, always, in, contact, with, the, ground, the, legs, are, kept, mostly, straight, and, the, center, of, gravity, vaults, over, the, stance, leg, or, legs, in, an, inverted, pendulum, fashion, a, feature, of, a, running, body, from, the, viewpoint, of, spring, mass, mechanics, is, that, changes, in, kinetic, and, potential, energy, within, a, stride, co, occur, with, energy, storage, accomplished, by, springy, tendons, and, passive, muscle, elasticity, the, term, running, can, refer, to, a, variety, of, speeds, ranging, from, jogging, to, sprinting, running, in, humans, is, associated, with, improved, health, and, life, expectancy, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, ancestors, of, humankind, developed, the, ability, to, run, for, long, distances, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, probably, to, hunt, animals, competitive, running, grew, out, of, religious, festivals, in, various, areas, records, of, competitive, racing, date, back, to, the, tailteann, games, in, ireland, between, 632, bce, and, 1171, bce, while, the, first, recorded, olympic, games, took, place, in, 776, bce, running, has, been, described, as, the, world, s, most, accessible, sport, it, is, thought, that, human, running, evolved, at, least, four, and, a, half, million, years, ago, out, of, the, ability, of, the, ape, like, australopithecus, an, early, ancestor, of, humans, to, walk, upright, on, two, legs, early, humans, most, likely, developed, into, endurance, runners, from, the, practice, of, persistence, hunting, of, animals, the, activity, of, following, and, chasing, until, a, prey, is, too, exhausted, to, flee, succumbing, to, chase, myopathy, sears, 2001, and, that, human, features, such, as, the, nuchal, ligament, abundant, sweat, glands, the, achilles, tendons, big, knee, joints, and, muscular, glutei, maximi, were, changes, caused, by, this, type, of, activity, bramble, lieberman, 2004, et, al, the, theory, as, first, proposed, used, comparative, physiological, evidence, and, the, natural, habits, of, animals, when, running, indicating, the, likelihood, of, this, activity, as, a, successful, hunting, method, further, evidence, from, observation, of, modern, day, hunting, practices, also, indicated, this, likelihood, carrier, et, al, 1984, according, to, sears, p, 12, scientific, investigation, walker, leakey, 1993, of, the, nariokotome, skeleton, provided, further, evidence, for, the, carrier, theory, competitive, running, grew, out, of, religious, festivals, in, various, areas, such, as, greece, egypt, asia, and, the, east, african, rift, in, africa, the, tailteann, games, an, irish, sporting, festival, in, honor, of, the, goddess, tailtiu, dates, back, to, 1829, bce, and, is, one, of, the, earliest, records, of, competitive, running, the, origins, of, the, olympics, and, marathon, running, are, shrouded, by, myth, and, legend, though, the, first, recorded, games, took, place, in, 776, bce, running, in, ancient, greece, can, be, traced, back, to, these, games, of, 776, bce, i, suspect, that, the, sun, moon, earth, stars, and, heaven, which, are, still, the, gods, of, many, barbarians, were, the, only, gods, known, to, the, aboriginal, hellenes, seeing, that, they, were, always, moving, and, running, from, their, running, nature, they, were, called, gods, or, runners, thus, theontas, running, gait, can, be, divided, into, two, phases, regarding, the, lower, extremity, stance, and, swing, these, can, be, further, divided, into, absorption, propulsion, initial, swing, and, terminal, swing, due, to, the, continuous, nature, of, running, gait, no, certain, point, is, assumed, to, be, the, beginning, however, for, simplicity, it, will, be, assumed, that, absorption, and, footstrike, mark, the, beginning, of, the, running, cycle, in, a, body, already, in, motion, footstrike, occurs, when, a, plantar, portion, of, the, foot, makes, initial, contact, with, the, ground, common, footstrike, types, include, forefoot, midfoot, and, heel, strike, types, these, are, characterized, by, initial, contact, of, the, ball, of, the, foot, ball, and, heel, of, the, foot, simultaneously, and, heel, of, the, foot, respectively, during, this, time, the, hip, joint, is, undergoing, extension, from, being, in, maximal, flexion, from, the, previous, swing, phase, for, proper, force, absorption, the, knee, joint, should, be, flexed, upon, the, footstrike, and, the, ankle, should, be, slightly, in, front, of, the, body, footstrike, begins, the, absorption, phase, as, forces, from, initial, contact, are, attenuated, throughout, the, lower, extremity, absorption, of, forces, continues, as, the, body, moves, from, footstrike, to, midstance, due, to, vertical, propulsion, from, the, toe, off, during, a, previous, gait, cycle, midstance, is, when, the, lower, extremity, limb, of, focus, is, in, knee, flexion, directly, underneath, the, trunk, pelvis, and, hips, at, this, point, propulsion, begins, to, occur, as, the, hips, undergo, hip, extension, the, knee, joint, undergoes, extension, and, the, ankle, undergoes, plantar, flexion, propulsion, continues, until, the, leg, is, extended, behind, the, body, and, toe, off, occurs, this, involves, a, maximal, hip, extension, knee, extension, and, plantar, flexion, for, the, subject, resulting, in, the, body, being, pushed, forward, from, this, motion, and, the, ankle, foot, leaves, the, ground, as, the, initial, swing, begins, recent, research, especially, in, the, footstrike, debate, has, primarily, focused, on, identifying, and, preventing, injuries, during, the, absorption, phases, of, running, the, propulsion, phase, which, occurs, from, midstance, to, toe, off, is, crucial, for, understanding, how, the, body, moves, forward, in, a, full, stride, length, model, elements, of, both, the, terminal, swing, and, footstrike, contribute, to, propulsion, the, setup, for, propulsion, begins, at, the, end, of, the, terminal, swing, when, the, hip, joint, flexes, allowing, the, hip, extensors, to, generate, force, as, they, accelerate, through, the, maximal, range, of, motion, as, the, hip, extensors, transition, from, inhibitory, to, primary, muscle, movers, the, lower, extremity, moves, back, towards, the, ground, aided, by, the, stretch, reflex, and, gravity, the, footstrike, and, absorption, phases, follow, leading, to, two, possible, outcomes, with, a, heel, strike, this, phase, may, be, just, a, continuation, of, momentum, from, the, stretch, reflex, gravity, and, light, hip, extension, offering, little, force, absorption, through, the, ankle, joint, on, the, other, hand, a, mid, forefoot, strike, helps, in, shock, absorption, supporting, plantar, flexion, from, midstance, to, toe, off, actual, propulsion, begins, as, the, lower, extremity, enters, midstance, the, hip, extensors, continue, contracting, assisted, by, gravity, and, the, stretch, reflex, from, maximal, hip, flexion, during, the, terminal, swing, hip, extension, pulls, the, ground, underneath, the, body, propelling, the, runner, forward, during, midstance, the, knee, should, be, slightly, flexed, due, to, elastic, loading, from, the, absorption, and, footstrike, phases, preserving, forward, momentum, the, ankle, joint, is, in, dorsiflexion, at, this, point, either, elastically, loaded, from, a, mid, forefoot, strike, or, preparing, for, stand, alone, concentric, plantar, flexion, the, final, propulsive, movements, during, toe, off, involve, all, three, joints, ankle, knee, and, hip, the, plantar, flexors, push, off, from, the, ground, returning, from, dorsiflexion, in, midstance, this, can, occur, either, by, releasing, the, elastic, load, from, an, earlier, mid, forefoot, strike, or, through, concentric, contraction, from, a, heel, strike, with, a, forefoot, strike, the, ankle, and, knee, joints, release, their, stored, elastic, energy, from, the, footstrike, absorption, phase, the, quadriceps, group, knee, extensors, fully, extend, the, knee, pushing, the, body, off, the, ground, simultaneously, the, knee, flexors, and, stretch, reflex, pull, the, knee, back, into, flexion, initiating, the, initial, swing, phase, the, hip, extensors, extend, to, the, maximum, contributing, to, forces, pulling, and, pushing, off, the, ground, as, well, as, initiating, knee, flexion, and, the, initial, swing, phase, initial, swing, is, the, response, of, both, stretch, reflexes, and, concentric, movements, to, the, propulsion, movements, of, the, body, hip, flexion, and, knee, flexion, occur, beginning, the, return, of, the, limb, to, the, starting, position, and, setting, up, for, another, foot, strike, the, initial, swing, ends, at, midswing, when, the, limb, is, again, directly, underneath, the, trunk, pelvis, and, hip, with, the, knee, joint, flexed, and, hip, flexion, continuing, terminal, swing, then, begins, as, hip, flexion, continues, to, the, point, of, activation, of, the, stretch, reflex, of, the, hip, extensors, the, knee, begins, to, extend, slightly, as, it, swings, to, the, anterior, portion, of, the, body, the, foot, then, makes, contact, with, the, ground, with, a, foot, strike, completing, the, running, cycle, of, one, side, of, the, lower, extremity, each, limb, of, the, lower, extremity, works, opposite, to, the, other, when, one, side, is, in, toe, off, propulsion, the, other, hand, is, in, the, swing, recovery, phase, preparing, for, footstrike, following, toe, off, and, the, beginning, of, the, initial, swing, of, one, side, there, is, a, flight, phase, where, neither, extremity, is, in, contact, with, the, ground, due, to, the, opposite, side, finishing, terminal, swing, as, the, footstrike, of, the, one, hand, occurs, the, initial, swing, continues, the, opposing, limbs, meet, with, one, in, midstance, and, midswing, beginning, the, propulsion, and, terminal, swing, phases, the, upper, extremity, function, serves, mainly, in, providing, balance, in, conjunction, with, the, opposing, side, of, the, lower, extremity, the, movement, of, each, leg, is, paired, with, the, opposite, arm, which, serves, to, counterbalance, the, body, particularly, during, the, stance, phase, the, arms, move, most, effectively, as, seen, in, elite, athletes, with, the, elbow, joint, at, approximately, 90, degrees, or, less, the, hands, swinging, from, the, hips, up, to, mid, chest, level, with, the, opposite, leg, the, humerus, moving, from, being, parallel, with, the, trunk, to, approximately, 45, degrees, shoulder, extension, never, passing, the, trunk, in, flexion, and, with, as, little, movement, in, the, transverse, plane, as, possible, the, trunk, also, rotates, in, conjunction, with, arm, swing, it, mainly, serves, as, a, balance, point, from, which, the, limbs, are, anchored, thus, trunk, motion, should, remain, mostly, stable, with, little, motion, except, for, slight, rotation, as, excessive, movement, would, contribute, to, transverse, motion, and, wasted, energy, recent, research, into, various, forms, of, running, has, focused, on, the, differences, in, the, potential, injury, risks, and, shock, absorption, capabilities, between, heel, and, mid, forefoot, footstrikes, it, has, been, shown, that, heel, striking, is, generally, associated, with, higher, rates, of, injury, and, impact, due, to, inefficient, shock, absorption, and, inefficient, biomechanical, compensations, for, these, forces, this, is, due, to, pressures, from, a, heel, strike, traveling, through, bones, for, shock, absorption, rather, than, being, absorbed, by, muscles, since, bones, cannot, disperse, forces, easily, the, forces, are, transmitted, to, other, parts, of, the, body, including, ligaments, joints, and, bones, in, the, rest, of, the, lower, extremities, up, to, the, lower, back, this, causes, the, body, to, use, abnormal, compensatory, motions, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, serious, bone, injuries, these, compensations, include, internal, rotation, of, the, tibia, knee, and, hip, joints, excessive, compensation, over, time, has, been, linked, to, a, higher, risk, of, injuries, in, those, joints, and, the, muscles, involved, in, those, motions, conversely, a, mid, forefoot, strike, has, been, associated, with, greater, efficiency, and, lower, injury, risk, due, to, the, triceps, surae, being, used, as, a, lever, system, to, absorb, forces, with, the, muscles, eccentrically, rather, than, through, the, bone, landing, with, a, mid, forefoot, strike, has, also, been, shown, to, properly, attenuate, shock, and, allow, the, triceps, surae, to, aid, in, propulsion, via, reflexive, plantarflexion, after, stretching, to, absorb, ground, contact, forces, thus, a, mid, forefoot, strike, may, aid, in, propulsion, however, even, among, elite, athletes, there, are, variations, in, self, selected, footstrike, types, this, is, especially, true, in, longer, distance, events, where, there, is, a, prevalence, of, heel, strikers, there, does, tend, however, to, be, a, greater, percentage, of, mid, forefoot, striking, runners, in, the, elite, fields, particularly, in, the, faster, racers, and, the, winning, individuals, or, groups, while, one, could, attribute, the, faster, speeds, of, elite, runners, compared, to, recreational, runners, with, similar, footstrikes, to, physiological, differences, the, hip, and, joints, have, been, left, out, of, the, equation, for, proper, propulsion, this, raises, the, question, of, how, heel, striking, elite, distance, runners, can, keep, up, such, high, paces, with, a, supposedly, inefficient, and, injurious, foot, strike, technique, biomechanical, factors, associated, with, elite, runners, include, increased, hip, function, use, and, stride, length, over, recreational, runners, an, increase, in, running, speeds, causes, increased, ground, reaction, forces, and, elite, distance, runners, must, compensate, for, this, to, maintain, their, pace, over, long, distances, these, forces, are, attenuated, through, increased, stride, length, via, increased, hip, flexion, and, extension, through, decreased, ground, contact, time, and, more, energy, being, used, in, propulsion, with, increased, propulsion, in, the, horizontal, plane, less, impact, occurs, from, the, decreased, force, in, the, vertical, plane, increased, hip, flexion, allows, for, increased, use, of, the, hip, extensors, through, midstance, and, toe, off, allowing, for, more, force, production, the, difference, even, between, world, class, and, national, level, 1500, m, runners, has, been, associated, with, more, efficient, hip, joint, function, the, increase, in, velocity, likely, comes, from, the, increased, range, of, motion, in, hip, flexion, and, extension, allowing, for, greater, acceleration, and, speed, the, hip, extensors, and, extension, have, been, linked, to, more, powerful, knee, extension, during, toe, off, contributing, to, propulsion, stride, length, must, be, appropriately, increased, with, some, degree, of, knee, flexion, maintained, through, the, terminal, swing, phases, as, excessive, knee, extension, during, this, phase, along, with, footstrike, has, been, associated, with, higher, impact, forces, due, to, braking, and, an, increased, prevalence, of, heel, striking, elite, runners, tend, to, exhibit, some, degree, of, knee, flexion, at, footstrike, and, midstance, which, first, serves, to, eccentrically, absorb, impact, forces, in, the, quadriceps, muscle, group, secondly, it, allows, for, the, knee, joint, to, contract, concentrically, and, provides, significant, aid, in, propulsion, during, toe, off, as, the, quadriceps, group, is, capable, of, producing, large, amounts, of, force, recreational, runners, have, been, shown, to, increase, stride, length, through, increased, knee, extension, rather, than, increased, hip, flexion, as, exhibited, by, elite, runners, which, provides, an, intense, braking, motion, with, each, step, and, decreases, the, rate, and, efficiency, of, knee, extension, during, toe, off, slowing, down, speed, knee, extension, however, contributes, to, additional, stride, length, and, propulsion, during, toe, off, and, is, seen, more, frequently, in, elite, runners, as, well, leaning, forward, places, a, runner, s, center, of, mass, on, the, front, part, of, the, foot, which, avoids, landing, on, the, heel, and, facilitates, the, use, of, the, spring, mechanism, of, the, foot, it, also, makes, it, easier, for, the, runner, to, avoid, landing, the, foot, in, front, of, the, center, of, mass, and, the, resultant, braking, effect, while, upright, posture, is, essential, a, runner, should, maintain, a, relaxed, frame, and, use, their, core, to, keep, posture, upright, and, stable, this, helps, prevent, injury, as, long, as, the, body, is, neither, rigid, nor, tense, the, most, common, running, mistakes, are, tilting, the, chin, up, and, scrunching, shoulders, exercise, physiologists, have, found, that, the, stride, rates, are, extremely, consistent, across, professional, runners, between, 185, and, 200, steps, per, minute, the, main, difference, between, long, and, short, distance, runners, is, the, length, of, stride, rather, than, the, rate, of, stride, during, running, the, speed, at, which, the, runner, moves, may, be, calculated, by, multiplying, the, cadence, steps, per, minute, by, the, stride, length, running, is, often, measured, in, terms, of, pace, expressed, in, units, of, minutes, per, mile, or, minutes, per, kilometer, the, inverse, of, speed, in, mph, or, km, h, some, coaches, advocate, training, at, a, combination, of, specific, paces, related, to, one, s, fitness, to, stimulate, various, physiological, improvements, different, types, of, stride, are, necessary, for, different, types, of, running, when, sprinting, runners, stay, on, their, toes, bringing, their, legs, up, using, shorter, and, faster, strides, long, distance, runners, tend, to, have, more, relaxed, strides, that, vary, while, there, exists, the, potential, for, injury, while, running, just, as, there, is, in, any, sport, there, are, many, benefits, some, of, these, benefits, include, potential, weight, loss, improved, cardiovascular, and, respiratory, health, reducing, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, and, respiratory, diseases, improved, cardiovascular, fitness, reduced, total, blood, cholesterol, strengthening, of, bones, and, potentially, increased, bone, density, possible, strengthening, of, the, immune, system, and, an, improved, self, esteem, and, emotional, state, running, like, all, forms, of, regular, exercise, can, effectively, slow, or, reverse, the, effects, of, aging, even, people, who, have, already, experienced, a, heart, attack, are, 20, less, likely, to, develop, serious, heart, problems, if, more, engaged, in, running, or, any, type, of, aerobic, activity, although, an, optimal, amount, of, vigorous, aerobic, exercise, such, as, running, might, bring, benefits, related, to, lower, cardiovascular, disease, and, life, extension, an, excessive, dose, e, g, marathons, might, have, an, opposite, effect, associated, with, cardiotoxicity, running, can, assist, people, in, losing, weight, staying, in, shape, and, improving, body, composition, research, suggests, that, the, person, of, average, weight, will, burn, approximately, 100, calories, per, mile, run, running, increases, one, s, metabolism, even, after, running, one, will, continue, to, burn, an, increased, level, of, calories, for, a, short, time, after, the, run, different, speeds, and, distances, are, appropriate, for, different, individual, health, and, fitness, levels, for, new, runners, it, takes, time, to, get, into, shape, the, key, is, consistency, and, a, slow, increase, in, speed, and, distance, while, running, it, is, best, to, pay, attention, to, how, one, s, body, feels, if, a, runner, is, gasping, for, breath, or, feels, exhausted, while, running, it, may, be, beneficial, to, slow, down, or, try, a, shorter, distance, for, a, few, weeks, if, a, runner, feels, that, the, pace, or, distance, is, no, longer, challenging, then, the, runner, may, want, to, speed, up, or, run, farther, running, can, also, have, psychological, benefits, as, many, participants, in, the, sport, report, feeling, an, elated, euphoric, state, often, referred, to, as, a, runner, s, high, running, is, frequently, recommended, as, therapy, for, people, with, clinical, depression, and, people, coping, with, addiction, a, possible, benefit, may, be, the, enjoyment, of, nature, and, scenery, which, also, improves, psychological, well, being, see, ecopsychology, practical, benefits, in, animal, models, running, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, number, of, newly, created, neurons, within, the, brain, this, finding, could, have, significant, implications, in, aging, as, well, as, learning, and, memory, a, recent, study, published, in, cell, metabolism, has, also, linked, running, with, improved, memory, and, learning, skills, running, is, an, effective, way, to, reduce, stress, anxiety, depression, and, inflammation, it, helps, people, who, struggle, with, seasonal, affective, disorder, by, running, outside, when, it, is, sunny, and, warm, running, can, improve, mental, alertness, and, sleep, both, research, and, clinical, experience, have, shown, that, exercise, can, be, a, treatment, for, serious, depression, and, anxiety, even, some, physicians, prescribe, exercise, to, most, of, their, patients, running, can, have, a, longer, lasting, effect, than, anti, depressants, the, non, threatening, environment, offered, by, running, generates, a, sense, of, achievement, and, belonging, which, helps, with, mental, illness, many, injuries, are, associated, with, running, because, of, its, high, impact, nature, change, in, running, volume, may, lead, to, development, of, patellofemoral, pain, syndrome, iliotibial, band, syndrome, patellar, tendinopathy, plica, syndrome, and, medial, tibial, stress, syndrome, change, in, running, pace, may, cause, achilles, tendinitis, gastrocnemius, injuries, and, plantar, fasciitis, repetitive, stress, on, the, same, tissues, without, enough, time, for, recovery, or, running, with, improper, form, can, lead, to, many, of, the, above, runners, generally, attempt, to, minimize, these, injuries, by, warming, up, before, exercise, focusing, on, proper, running, form, performing, strength, training, exercises, eating, a, well, balanced, diet, allowing, time, for, recovery, and, icing, applying, ice, to, sore, muscles, or, taking, an, ice, bath, some, runners, may, experience, injuries, when, running, on, concrete, surfaces, the, problem, with, running, on, concrete, is, that, the, body, adjusts, to, this, flat, surface, running, and, some, of, the, muscles, will, become, weaker, along, with, the, added, impact, of, running, on, a, harder, surface, therefore, it, can, be, beneficial, to, change, terrain, occasionally, such, as, trail, beach, or, grass, running, this, is, more, unstable, ground, and, allows, the, legs, to, strengthen, different, muscles, runners, should, be, wary, of, twisting, their, ankles, on, such, terrain, running, downhill, also, increases, knee, stress, and, should, therefore, be, avoided, reducing, the, frequency, and, duration, can, also, prevent, injury, barefoot, running, has, been, promoted, as, a, means, of, reducing, running, related, injuries, but, this, remains, controversial, and, a, majority, of, professionals, advocate, the, wearing, of, appropriate, shoes, as, the, best, method, for, avoiding, injury, however, a, study, in, 2013, concluded, that, wearing, neutral, shoes, is, not, associated, with, increased, injuries, another, common, running, related, injury, is, chafing, caused, by, repetitive, rubbing, of, one, piece, of, skin, against, another, or, against, an, article, of, clothing, one, common, location, for, chafe, to, occur, is, the, runner, s, upper, thighs, the, skin, feels, coarse, and, develops, a, rash, like, look, a, variety, of, deodorants, and, special, anti, chafing, creams, are, available, to, treat, such, problems, chafe, is, also, likely, to, occur, on, the, nipple, there, are, a, variety, of, home, remedies, that, runners, use, to, deal, with, chafing, while, running, such, as, band, aids, and, using, grease, to, reduce, friction, prevention, is, key, which, is, why, form, fitting, clothes, are, important, an, iliotibial, band, is, a, muscle, and, tendon, that, is, attached, to, the, hip, and, runs, the, length, of, the, thigh, to, attach, to, the, upper, part, of, the, tibia, and, the, band, is, what, helps, the, knee, to, bend, this, is, an, injury, that, is, located, at, the, knee, and, shows, symptoms, of, swelling, outside, the, knee, iliotibial, band, syndrome, is, also, known, as, runner, s, knee, or, jogger, s, knee, because, it, can, be, caused, by, jogging, or, running, once, pain, or, swelling, is, noticeable, it, is, important, to, put, ice, on, it, immediately, and, it, is, recommended, to, rest, the, knee, for, better, healing, most, knee, injuries, can, be, treated, by, light, activity, and, much, rest, for, the, knee, in, more, serious, cases, arthroscopy, is, the, most, common, to, help, repair, ligaments, but, severe, situations, reconstructive, surgery, would, be, needed, a, survey, was, taken, in, 2011, with, knee, injuries, being, 22, 7, of, the, most, common, injuries, a, more, known, injury, is, medial, tibial, stress, syndrome, mtss, which, is, the, accurate, name, for, shin, splints, this, is, caused, during, running, when, the, muscle, is, being, overused, along, the, front, of, the, lower, leg, with, symptoms, that, affect, 2, to, 6, inches, of, the, muscle, shin, splints, have, sharp, splinter, like, pain, that, is, typically, x, rayed, by, doctors, but, is, not, necessary, for, shin, splints, to, be, diagnosed, to, help, prevent, shin, splints, it, is, commonly, known, to, stretch, before, and, after, a, workout, session, and, also, avoid, heavy, equipment, especially, during, the, first, couple, of, workout, sessions, also, to, help, prevent, shin, splints, do, not, increase, the, intensity, of, a, workout, more, than, 10, a, week, to, treat, shin, splints, it, is, important, to, rest, with, the, least, amount, of, impact, on, your, legs, and, apply, ice, to,
