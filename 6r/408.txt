swimming, is, the, self, propulsion, of, a, person, through, water, or, other, liquid, usually, for, recreation, sport, exercise, or, survival, locomotion, is, achieved, through, coordinated, movement, of, the, limbs, and, the, body, to, achieve, hydrodynamic, thrust, that, results, in, directional, motion, humans, can, hold, their, breath, underwater, and, undertake, rudimentary, locomotive, swimming, within, weeks, of, birth, as, a, survival, response, swimming, requires, stamina, skills, and, proper, technique, swimming, is, a, popular, activity, and, competitive, sport, where, certain, techniques, are, deployed, to, move, through, water, it, offers, numerous, health, benefits, such, as, strengthened, cardiovascular, health, muscle, strength, and, increased, flexibility, it, is, suitable, for, people, of, all, ages, and, fitness, levels, swimming, is, consistently, among, the, top, public, recreational, activities, and, in, some, countries, swimming, lessons, are, a, compulsory, part, of, the, educational, curriculum, as, a, formalized, sport, swimming, is, featured, in, various, local, national, and, international, competitions, including, every, modern, summer, olympics, swimming, involves, repeated, motions, known, as, strokes, to, propel, the, body, forward, while, the, front, crawl, also, known, as, freestyle, is, widely, regarded, as, the, fastest, of, the, four, main, strokes, other, strokes, are, practiced, for, special, purposes, such, as, training, swimming, comes, with, certain, risks, mainly, because, of, the, aquatic, environment, where, it, takes, place, by, way, of, example, swimmers, may, find, themselves, incapacitated, by, panic, and, exhaustion, both, potential, causes, of, death, by, drowning, other, dangers, may, arise, from, exposure, to, infection, or, hostile, aquatic, fauna, to, minimize, such, eventualities, most, facilities, employ, a, lifeguard, to, keep, alert, for, any, signs, of, distress, swimmers, often, wear, specialized, swimwear, although, depending, on, the, area, s, culture, some, swimmers, may, also, swim, nude, or, wear, their, day, attire, in, addition, a, variety, of, equipment, can, be, used, to, enhance, the, swimming, experience, or, performance, including, but, not, limited, to, the, use, of, swimming, goggles, floatation, devices, swim, fins, and, snorkels, swimming, relies, on, the, nearly, neutral, buoyancy, of, the, human, body, on, average, the, body, has, a, relative, density, of, 0, 98, compared, to, water, which, causes, the, body, to, float, however, buoyancy, varies, based, on, body, composition, lung, inflation, muscle, and, fat, content, centre, of, gravity, and, the, salinity, of, the, water, higher, levels, of, body, fat, and, saltier, water, both, lower, the, relative, density, of, the, body, and, increase, its, buoyancy, because, they, tend, to, have, a, lower, centre, of, gravity, and, higher, muscle, content, human, males, find, it, more, difficult, to, float, or, be, buoyant, see, also, hydrostatic, weighing, since, the, human, body, is, less, dense, than, water, water, can, support, the, body, s, weight, during, swimming, as, a, result, swimming, is, low, impact, compared, to, land, activities, such, as, running, the, density, and, viscosity, of, water, also, create, resistance, for, objects, moving, through, the, water, swimming, strokes, use, this, resistance, to, create, propulsion, but, this, same, resistance, also, generates, drag, on, the, body, hydrodynamics, is, important, to, stroke, technique, for, swimming, faster, and, swimmers, who, want, to, swim, faster, or, exhaust, less, try, to, reduce, the, drag, of, the, body, s, motion, through, the, water, to, be, more, hydrodynamically, effective, swimmers, can, either, increase, the, power, of, their, strokes, or, reduce, water, resistance, however, power, must, increase, by, a, factor, of, three, to, achieve, the, same, effect, as, reducing, resistance, efficient, swimming, by, reducing, water, resistance, involves, a, horizontal, water, position, rolling, the, body, to, reduce, the, breadth, of, the, body, in, the, water, and, extending, the, arms, as, far, as, possible, to, reduce, wave, resistance, just, before, plunging, into, the, pool, swimmers, may, perform, exercises, such, as, squatting, squatting, helps, enhance, a, swimmer, s, start, by, warming, up, the, thigh, muscles, human, babies, demonstrate, an, innate, swimming, or, diving, reflex, from, newborn, until, approximately, ten, months, other, mammals, also, demonstrate, this, phenomenon, see, mammalian, diving, reflex, the, diving, response, involves, apnea, reflex, bradycardia, and, peripheral, vasoconstriction, in, other, words, babies, immersed, in, water, spontaneously, hold, their, breath, slow, their, heart, rate, and, reduce, blood, circulation, to, the, extremities, fingers, and, toes, because, infants, are, innately, able, to, swim, classes, for, babies, about, six, months, old, are, offered, in, many, locations, this, helps, build, muscle, memory, and, makes, strong, swimmers, from, a, young, age, swimming, can, be, undertaken, using, a, wide, range, of, styles, known, as, strokes, and, which, are, used, for, different, purposes, or, to, distinguish, between, classes, in, competitive, swimming, using, a, defined, stroke, for, propulsion, through, the, water, is, unnecessary, and, untrained, swimmers, may, use, a, doggy, paddle, of, arm, and, leg, movements, similar, to, how, four, legged, animals, swim, four, main, strokes, are, used, in, competition, and, recreational, swimming, the, front, crawl, breaststroke, backstroke, and, butterfly, competitive, swimming, in, europe, started, around, 1800, mostly, using, the, breaststroke, which, started, as, the, current, breaststroke, arms, and, the, legs, of, the, butterfly, stroke, in, 1873, john, arthur, trudgen, introduced, the, trudgen, to, western, swimming, competitions, the, butterfly, was, developed, in, the, 1930s, and, was, considered, a, variant, of, the, breaststroke, until, it, was, accepted, as, a, separate, style, in, 1953, butterfly, is, considered, the, hardest, stroke, by, many, people, but, it, is, the, most, effective, for, all, around, toning, and, the, building, of, muscles, it, also, burns, the, most, calories, and, can, be, the, second, fastest, stroke, if, practiced, regularly, in, non, competitive, swimming, there, are, some, swimming, strokes, including, sidestroke, the, sidestroke, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, changed, this, pattern, by, raising, one, arm, above, the, water, first, then, the, other, and, then, each, in, turn, it, is, still, used, in, lifesaving, and, recreational, swimming, other, strokes, exist, for, particular, reasons, such, as, training, school, lessons, and, rescue, and, it, is, often, possible, to, change, strokes, to, avoid, using, parts, of, the, body, either, to, separate, specific, body, parts, such, as, swimming, with, only, arms, or, legs, to, exercise, them, harder, or, for, amputees, or, those, affected, by, paralysis, swimming, has, been, recorded, since, prehistoric, times, and, the, earliest, records, of, swimming, date, back, to, stone, age, paintings, from, around, 7, 000, years, ago, written, references, date, from, 2000, bce, some, earliest, references, include, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, the, iliad, the, odyssey, the, bible, ezekiel, 47, 5, acts, 27, 42, isaiah, 25, 11, beowulf, and, other, sagas, in, 450, bc, herodotus, described, a, failed, seaborne, expedition, of, mardonius, with, the, words, those, who, could, not, swim, perished, from, that, cause, others, from, the, cold, the, coastal, tribes, living, in, the, volatile, low, countries, were, known, as, excellent, swimmers, by, the, romans, men, and, horses, of, the, batavi, tribe, could, cross, the, rhine, without, losing, formation, according, to, tacitus, dio, cassius, describes, one, surprise, tactic, employed, by, aulus, plautius, against, the, celts, at, the, battle, of, the, medway, the, thought, that, romans, would, not, be, able, to, cross, it, without, a, bridge, and, consequently, bivouacked, in, rather, careless, fashion, on, the, opposite, bank, but, he, sent, across, a, detachment, of, who, were, accustomed, to, swim, easily, in, full, armour, across, the, most, turbulent, streams, thence, the, britons, retired, to, the, river, thames, at, a, point, near, where, it, empties, into, the, ocean, and, at, flood, tide, forms, a, lake, this, they, easily, crossed, because, they, knew, where, the, firm, ground, and, the, easy, passages, in, this, region, were, to, be, found, but, the, romans, in, attempting, to, follow, them, were, not, so, successful, however, the, swam, across, again, and, some, others, got, over, by, a, bridge, a, little, way, up, stream, after, which, they, assailed, the, barbarians, from, several, sides, at, once, and, cut, down, many, of, them, the, talmud, a, compendium, of, jewish, law, written, compiled, c, 500, ce, requires, fathers, to, teach, their, son, how, to, swim, in, 1538, nikolaus, wynmann, a, swiss, german, professor, of, languages, wrote, the, earliest, known, complete, book, about, swimming, colymbetes, sive, de, arte, natandi, dialogus, et, festivus, et, iucundus, lectu, the, swimmer, or, a, dialogue, on, the, art, of, swimming, and, joyful, and, pleasant, to, read, there, are, many, reasons, why, people, swim, from, a, recreational, pursuit, to, swimming, as, a, necessary, part, of, a, job, or, other, activity, swimming, may, also, be, used, to, rehabilitate, injuries, especially, various, cardiovascular, and, muscle, injuries, people, may, also, pursue, swimming, as, a, career, or, field, of, interest, some, may, be, gifted, and, choose, to, compete, professionally, and, go, on, to, claim, fame, many, swimmers, swim, for, recreation, with, swimming, consistently, ranking, as, one, of, the, physical, activities, people, are, most, likely, to, participate, in, recreational, swimming, can, also, be, used, for, exercise, relaxation, or, rehabilitation, the, support, of, the, water, and, the, reduction, in, impact, make, swimming, accessible, for, people, unable, to, undertake, activities, such, as, running, swimming, is, one, of, the, most, relaxing, activities, and, water, is, known, to, calm, us, and, help, reduce, stress, swimming, is, primarily, a, cardiovascular, aerobic, exercise, due, to, the, long, exercise, time, requiring, a, constant, oxygen, supply, except, for, short, sprints, where, the, muscles, work, anaerobically, furthermore, swimming, can, help, tone, and, strengthen, muscles, regular, swimming, can, help, in, weight, management, and, contribute, to, maintaining, a, healthy, body, weight, robinson, 2022, swimming, allows, sufferers, of, arthritis, to, exercise, affected, joints, without, worsening, their, symptoms, swimming, is, often, recommended, for, individuals, with, joint, conditions, or, injuries, as, the, buoyancy, of, water, reduces, stress, on, the, joints, however, swimmers, with, arthritis, may, wish, to, avoid, swimming, breaststroke, as, improper, technique, can, exacerbate, arthritic, knee, pain, as, with, most, aerobic, exercise, swimming, reduces, the, harmful, effects, of, stress, swimming, also, improves, health, for, people, with, cardiovascular, problems, and, chronic, illnesses, it, is, proven, to, impact, the, mental, health, of, pregnant, women, and, mothers, positively, swimming, can, even, improve, mood, although, many, forms, of, physical, activity, have, been, shown, to, improve, bone, density, and, health, this, is, where, swimming, has, its, downfalls, due, to, the, low, impact, nature, of, the, sport, studies, have, demonstrated, that, bone, mass, acquisition, will, be, negatively, impacted, which, could, be, an, issue, for, adolescent, athletes, in, particular, since, 2010, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, has, required, that, swimming, pools, in, the, united, states, be, accessible, to, disabled, swimmers, water, based, exercise, can, benefit, older, adults, by, improving, quality, of, life, and, decreasing, disability, it, also, improves, or, maintains, the, bone, health, of, post, menopausal, women, swimming, is, an, ideal, workout, for, the, elderly, as, it, is, a, low, impact, sport, with, very, little, risk, of, injury, exercise, in, the, water, works, out, all, muscle, groups, helping, with, conditions, such, as, muscular, dystrophy, which, is, common, in, seniors, it, is, also, a, common, way, to, relieve, pain, from, arthritis, swimming, as, a, sport, predominantly, involves, participants, competing, to, be, the, fastest, over, a, given, distance, in, a, certain, period, of, time, competitors, swim, different, distances, in, different, levels, of, competition, for, example, swimming, has, been, an, olympic, sport, since, 1896, and, the, current, program, includes, events, from, 50, m, to, 1500, m, in, length, across, all, four, main, strokes, and, medley, during, the, season, competitive, swimmers, typically, train, multiple, times, per, day, and, week, to, increase, endurance, strength, and, preserve, fitness, furthermore, when, the, cycle, of, work, is, completed, swimmers, go, through, a, stage, called, taper, where, intensity, is, reduced, in, preparation, for, competition, season, during, taper, focus, is, on, power, and, water, feel, the, sport, is, governed, internationally, by, the, f, d, ration, internationale, de, natation, fina, and, competition, pools, for, fina, events, are, 25, or, 50, meters, in, length, in, the, united, states, a, pool, 25, yards, in, length, is, commonly, used, for, competition, other, swimming, and, water, related, sporting, disciplines, include, open, water, swimming, diving, synchronized, swimming, water, polo, triathlon, and, the, modern, pentathlon, it, is, important, to, prioritize, safety, when, swimming, this, includes, having, lifeguards, present, swimming, in, designated, areas, and, being, aware, of, potential, hazards, such, as, currents, and, underwater, obstacles, as, a, popular, leisure, activity, done, all, over, the, world, one, of, the, primary, risks, of, swimming, is, drowning, drowning, may, occur, from, a, variety, of, factors, from, swimming, fatigue, to, simply, inexperience, in, the, water, from, 2005, to, 2014, an, average, of, 3, 536, fatal, unintentional, drownings, occurred, in, the, united, states, approximating, 10, deaths, a, day, to, minimize, the, risk, and, prevent, potential, drownings, from, occurring, lifeguards, are, often, employed, to, supervise, swimming, locations, such, as, pools, waterparks, lakes, and, beaches, different, lifeguards, receive, different, training, depending, on, the, sites, that, they, are, employed, at, i, e, a, waterfront, lifeguard, receives, more, rigorous, training, than, a, poolside, lifeguard, well, known, aquatic, training, services, include, the, national, lifesaving, society, and, the, canadian, red, cross, which, specialize, in, training, lifeguards, in, north, america, learning, basic, water, safety, skills, such, as, swimming, with, a, buddy, and, knowing, how, to, respond, to, emergencies, is, essential, for, swimmers, of, all, levels, some, occupations, require, workers, to, swim, such, as, abalone, and, pearl, diving, and, spearfishing, swimming, is, used, to, rescue, people, in, the, water, who, are, in, distress, including, exhausted, swimmers, non, swimmers, who, have, accidentally, entered, the, water, and, others, who, have, come, to, harm, on, the, water, lifeguards, or, volunteer, lifesavers, are, deployed, at, many, pools, and, beaches, worldwide, to, fulfil, this, purpose, and, they, as, well, as, rescue, swimmers, may, use, specific, swimming, styles, for, rescue, purposes, swimming, is, also, used, in, marine, biology, to, observe, plants, and, animals, in, their, natural, habitat, other, sciences, use, swimming, for, example, konrad, lorenz, swam, with, geese, as, part, of, his, studies, of, animal, behavior, swimming, also, has, military, purposes, military, swimming, is, usually, done, by, special, operation, forces, such, as, navy, seals, and, us, army, special, forces, swimming, is, used, to, approach, a, location, gather, intelligence, engage, in, sabotage, or, combat, and, subsequently, depart, this, may, also, include, airborne, insertion, into, water, or, exiting, a, submarine, while, it, is, submerged, due, to, regular, exposure, to, large, bodies, of, water, all, recruits, in, the, united, states, navy, marine, corps, and, coast, guard, are, required, to, complete, basic, swimming, or, water, survival, training, swimming, is, also, a, professional, sport, companies, sponsor, swimmers, who, have, the, skills, to, compete, at, the, international, level, many, swimmers, compete, competitively, to, represent, their, home, countries, in, the, olympics, professional, swimmers, may, also, earn, a, living, as, entertainers, performing, in, water, ballets, locomotion, by, swimming, over, brief, distances, is, frequent, when, alternatives, are, precluded, there, have, been, cases, of, political, refugees, swimming, in, the, baltic, sea, and, of, people, jumping, in, the, water, and, swimming, ashore, from, vessels, not, intended, to, reach, land, where, they, planned, to, go, there, are, many, risks, associated, with, voluntary, or, involuntary, human, presence, in, water, which, may, result, in, death, directly, or, through, drowning, asphyxiation, swimming, is, both, the, goal, of, much, voluntary, presence, and, the, prime, means, of, regaining, land, in, accidental, situations, most, recorded, water, deaths, fall, into, these, categories, adverse, effects, of, swimming, can, include, around, any, pool, area, safety, equipment, is, often, important, and, is, a, zoning, requirement, for, most, residential, pools, in, the, united, states, supervision, by, personnel, trained, in, rescue, techniques, is, required, at, most, competitive, swimming, meets, and, public, pools, traditionally, children, were, considered, not, able, to, swim, independently, until, 4, years, of, age, although, now, infant, swimming, lessons, are, recommended, to, prevent, drowning, in, sweden, denmark, norway, estonia, and, finland, the, curriculum, for, the, fifth, grade, fourth, grade, in, estonia, states, that, all, children, should, learn, to, swim, as, well, as, how, to, handle, emergencies, near, water, most, commonly, children, are, expected, to, be, able, to, swim, 200, metres, 660, ft, of, which, at, least, 50, metres, 160, ft, on, their, back, after, first, falling, into, deep, water, and, getting, their, head, under, water, even, though, about, 95, percent, of, swedish, school, children, know, how, to, swim, drowning, remains, the, third, most, common, cause, of, death, among, children, in, both, the, netherlands, and, belgium, swimming, lessons, under, school, time, schoolzwemmen, school, swimming, are, supported, by, the, government, most, schools, provide, swimming, lessons, there, is, a, long, tradition, of, swimming, lessons, in, the, netherlands, and, belgium, the, dutch, translation, for, the, breaststroke, swimming, style, is, even, schoolslag, schoolstroke, in, france, swimming, is, a, compulsory, part, of, the, curriculum, for, primary, schools, children, usually, spend, one, semester, per, year, learning, swimming, during, cp, ce1, ce2, cm1, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and, 4th, grade, in, many, places, swimming, lessons, are, provided, by, local, swimming, pools, both, those, run, by, the, local, authority, and, by, private, leisure, companies, many, schools, also, include, swimming, lessons, into, their, physical, education, curricula, provided, either, in, the, schools, own, pool, or, in, the, nearest, public, pool, in, the, uk, the, top, ups, scheme, calls, for, school, children, who, cannot, swim, by, the, age, of, 11, to, receive, intensive, daily, lessons, children, who, have, not, reached, great, britain, s, national, curriculum, standard, of, swimming, 25, meters, by, the, time, they, leave, primary, school, receive, a, half, hour, lesson, every, day, for, two, weeks, during, term, time, in, canada, and, mexico, there, has, been, a, call, to, include, swimming, in, public, school, curriculum, in, the, united, states, there, is, the, infant, swimming, resource, isr, initiative, that, provides, lessons, for, infant, children, to, cope, with, an, emergency, where, they, have, fallen, into, the, water, they, are, taught, how, to, roll, back, to, float, hold, their, breath, underwater, to, roll, onto, their, back, to, float, unassisted, rest, and, breathe, until, help, arrives, while, clothed, and, unclothed, in, isr, they, teach, the, children, how, to, roll, with, their, clothes, on, as, a, simulation, if, they, were, to, actually, fall, in, walking, or, crawling, by, in, switzerland, swimming, lessons, for, babies, are, popular, to, help, them, getting, used, to, be, in, another, element, at, the, competition, level, unlike, in, other, countries, such, as, the, commonwealth, countries, swimming, teams, are, not, related, to, educational, institutions, high, schools, and, universities, but, rather, to, cities, or, regions, standard, everyday, clothing, is, usually, impractical, for, swimming, and, is, unsafe, under, some, circumstances, most, cultures, today, expect, swimmers, to, wear, swimsuits, men, s, swimsuits, commonly, resemble, shorts, or, briefs, men, s, casual, swimsuits, for, example, boardshorts, are, rarely, skintight, unlike, competitive, swimwear, like, jammers, or, diveskins, in, most, cases, boys, and, men, swim, with, their, upper, body, exposed, except, in, countries, where, custom, or, law, prohibits, it, in, a, public, setting, or, for, practical, reasons, such, as, sun, protection, modern, women, s, swimsuits, are, generally, skintight, covering, the, pubic, region, and, the, breasts, see, bikini, women, s, swimwear, may, also, cover, the, midriff, as, well, women, s, swimwear, is, often, a, fashion, statement, and, whether, it, is, modest, or, not, is, a, subject, of, debate, by, many, groups, religious, and, secular, competitive, swimwear, is, built, so, that, the, wearer, can, swim, faster, and, more, efficiently, modern, competitive, swimwear, is, skintight, and, lightweight, there, are, many, kinds, of, competitive, swimwear, for, each, gender, it, is, used, in, aquatic, competitions, such, as, water, polo, swim, racing, diving, and, rowing, wetsuits, provide, both, thermal, insulation, and, flotation, many, swimmers, lack, buoyancy, in, the, leg, the, wetsuit, provides, additional, volume, at, a, lower, density, and, therefore, improves, buoyancy, and, trim, while, swimming, it, provides, insulation, between, the, skin, and, water, which, reduces, heat, loss, the, wetsuit, is, the, usual, choice, for, those, who, swim, in, cold, water, for, long, periods, of, time, as, it, reduces, susceptibility, to, hypothermia, some, people, also, choose, to, wear, no, clothing, while, swimming, in, some, european, countries, public, pools, allow, clothes, free, swimming, and, many, countries, have, beaches, where, one, can, swim, naked, it, is, legal, to, swim, naked, in, the, sea, at, all, uk, beaches, it, was, common, for, males, to, swim, naked, in, a, public, setting, up, to, the, early, 20th, century, today, swimming, naked, can, be, a, rebellious, activity, or, merely, a, casual, one
