dominoes, is, a, family, of, tile, based, games, played, with, gaming, pieces, each, domino, is, a, rectangular, tile, usually, with, a, line, dividing, its, face, into, two, square, ends, each, end, is, marked, with, a, number, of, spots, also, called, pips, or, dots, or, is, blank, the, backs, of, the, tiles, in, a, set, are, indistinguishable, either, blank, or, having, some, common, design, the, gaming, pieces, make, up, a, domino, set, sometimes, called, a, deck, or, pack, the, traditional, european, domino, set, consists, of, 28, tiles, also, known, as, pieces, bones, rocks, stones, men, cards, or, just, dominoes, featuring, all, combinations, of, spot, counts, between, zero, and, six, a, domino, set, is, a, generic, gaming, device, similar, to, playing, cards, or, dice, in, that, a, variety, of, games, can, be, played, with, a, set, another, form, of, entertainment, using, domino, pieces, is, the, practice, of, domino, toppling, the, earliest, mention, of, dominoes, is, from, song, dynasty, china, found, in, the, text, former, events, in, wulin, by, zhou, mi, 1232, 1298, modern, dominoes, first, appeared, in, italy, during, the, 18th, century, but, they, differ, from, chinese, dominoes, in, a, number, of, respects, and, there, is, no, confirmed, link, between, the, two, european, dominoes, may, have, developed, independently, or, italian, missionaries, in, china, may, have, brought, the, game, to, europe, 181, the, name, domino, is, probably, derived, from, the, resemblance, to, a, kind, of, carnival, costume, worn, during, the, venetian, carnival, often, consisting, of, a, black, hooded, robe, and, a, white, mask, despite, the, coinage, of, the, word, polyomino, as, a, generalization, there, is, no, connection, between, the, word, domino, and, the, number, 2, in, any, language, the, most, commonly, played, domino, games, are, domino, whist, matador, and, muggins, all, fives, other, popular, forms, include, texas, 42, chicken, foot, concentration, double, fives, and, mexican, train, 181, 182, in, britain, the, most, popular, league, and, pub, game, is, fives, and, threes, dominoes, have, sometimes, been, used, for, divination, such, as, bone, throwing, in, chinese, culture, and, in, the, african, diaspora, european, style, dominoes, are, traditionally, made, of, bone, silver, lip, ocean, pearl, oyster, shell, mother, of, pearl, ivory, or, a, dark, hardwood, such, as, ebony, with, contrasting, black, or, white, pips, inlaid, or, painted, some, sets, feature, the, top, half, thickness, in, mop, ivory, or, bone, with, the, lower, half, in, ebony, alternatively, domino, sets, have, been, made, from, many, different, natural, materials, stone, e, g, marble, granite, or, soapstone, other, woods, e, g, ash, oak, redwood, and, cedar, metals, e, g, brass, or, pewter, ceramic, clay, or, even, frosted, glass, or, crystal, these, sets, have, a, more, novel, look, and, the, often, heavier, weight, makes, them, feel, more, substantial, also, such, materials, and, the, resulting, products, are, usually, much, more, expensive, than, polymer, materials, modern, commercial, domino, sets, are, usually, made, of, synthetic, materials, such, as, abs, or, polystyrene, plastics, or, bakelite, and, other, phenolic, resins, many, sets, approximate, the, look, and, feel, of, ivory, while, others, use, colored, or, even, translucent, plastics, to, achieve, a, more, contemporary, look, modern, sets, also, commonly, use, a, different, color, for, the, dots, of, each, different, end, value, one, spots, might, have, black, pips, while, two, spots, might, be, green, three, red, etc, to, facilitate, finding, matching, ends, occasionally, one, may, find, a, domino, set, made, of, card, stock, like, that, for, playing, cards, such, sets, are, lightweight, compact, and, inexpensive, and, like, cards, are, more, susceptible, to, minor, disturbances, such, as, a, sudden, breeze, sometimes, the, tiles, have, a, metal, pin, called, a, spinner, or, pivot, in, the, middle, the, traditional, domino, set, contains, one, unique, piece, for, each, possible, combination, of, two, ends, with, zero, to, six, spots, and, is, known, as, a, double, six, set, because, the, highest, value, piece, has, six, pips, on, each, end, the, double, six, the, spots, from, one, to, six, are, generally, arranged, as, they, are, on, six, sided, dice, but, because, blank, ends, having, no, spots, are, used, seven, faces, are, possible, allowing, 28, unique, pieces, in, a, double, six, set, however, this, is, a, relatively, small, number, especially, when, playing, with, more, than, four, people, so, many, domino, sets, are, extended, by, introducing, ends, with, greater, numbers, of, spots, which, increases, the, number, of, unique, combinations, of, ends, and, thus, of, pieces, each, progressively, larger, set, increases, the, maximum, number, of, pips, on, an, end, by, three, so, the, common, extended, sets, are, double, nine, 55, tiles, double, 12, 91, tiles, double, 15, 136, tiles, and, double, 18, 190, tiles, which, is, the, maximum, in, practice, larger, sets, such, as, double, 21, 253, tiles, could, theoretically, exist, but, they, seem, to, be, extremely, rare, if, not, nonexistent, as, that, would, be, far, more, than, is, normally, necessary, for, most, domino, games, even, with, eight, players, as, the, set, becomes, larger, identifying, the, number, of, pips, on, each, domino, becomes, more, difficult, so, some, large, domino, sets, use, more, readable, arabic, numerals, instead, of, pips, in, china, early, domino, tiles, were, functionally, identical, to, playing, cards, an, identifiable, version, of, chinese, dominoes, developed, in, the, 12th, or, 13th, century, the, oldest, written, mention, of, domino, tiles, in, china, dates, to, the, 13th, century, and, comes, from, hangzhou, where, pupai, gambling, plaques, or, tiles, and, dice, are, listed, as, items, sold, by, peddlers, during, the, reign, of, emperor, xiaozong, of, song, r, 1162, 1189, it, is, not, entirely, clear, that, pupai, means, dominoes, but, the, same, term, is, used, two, centuries, later, by, the, ming, author, lu, rong, 1436, 1494, in, a, context, that, clearly, describes, domino, tiles, the, earliest, known, manual, on, dominoes, is, the, manual, of, the, xuanhe, period, which, purports, to, be, written, by, qu, you, 1341, 1427, but, some, scholars, believe, it, is, a, later, forgery, the, traditional, 32, piece, chinese, domino, set, made, to, represent, each, possible, face, of, two, thrown, dice, and, thus, have, no, blank, faces, differs, from, the, 28, piece, domino, set, found, in, the, west, during, the, mid, 18th, century, although, chinese, dominoes, with, blank, faces, were, known, during, the, 17th, century, each, domino, originally, represented, one, of, the, 21, results, of, throwing, two, six, sided, dice, 2d6, one, half, of, each, domino, is, set, with, the, pips, from, one, die, and, the, other, half, contains, the, pips, from, the, second, die, chinese, sets, also, introduce, duplicates, of, some, throws, and, divide, the, tiles, into, two, suits, military, and, civil, chinese, dominoes, are, also, longer, than, typical, european, ones, modern, dominoes, first, appeared, in, italy, during, the, 18th, century, but, they, differ, from, chinese, dominoes, in, a, number, of, respects, and, there, is, no, confirmed, link, between, the, two, european, dominoes, may, have, developed, independently, or, italian, missionaries, in, china, may, have, brought, the, game, to, europe, 181, having, been, established, in, italy, the, game, of, dominoes, spread, rapidly, to, austria, southern, germany, and, france, the, game, became, fashionable, in, france, in, the, mid, 18th, century, the, name, domino, does, not, appear, before, that, time, being, first, recorded, in, 1771, in, the, dictionnaire, de, tr, voux, there, are, two, earlier, recorded, meanings, for, the, french, word, domino, one, referring, to, the, masquerades, of, the, period, derived, from, the, term, for, the, hooded, garment, of, a, priest, the, other, referred, to, crude, and, brightly, colored, woodcuts, on, paper, formerly, popular, among, french, peasants, the, way, by, which, this, word, became, the, name, of, the, game, of, domino, remains, unclear, the, earliest, game, rules, in, europe, describe, a, simple, block, game, for, two, or, four, players, later, french, rules, add, the, variant, of, domino, la, p, che, fishing, domino, an, early, draw, game, as, well, as, a, three, hand, game, with, a, pool, from, france, the, game, was, introduced, to, england, by, the, late, 1700s, purportedly, brought, in, by, french, prisoners, of, war, the, early, forms, of, the, game, in, england, were, the, block, game, and, draw, game, the, rules, for, these, games, were, reprinted, largely, unchanged, for, over, half, a, century, in, 1863, a, new, game, variously, described, as, all, fives, fives, or, cribbage, dominoes, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, both, english, and, american, sources, this, was, the, first, scoring, game, and, it, borrowed, the, counting, and, scoring, features, of, cribbage, but, 5, domino, spots, instead, of, 15, card, points, became, the, basic, scoring, unit, worth, 1, game, point, the, game, was, played, to, 31, and, employed, a, cribbage, board, to, keep, score, in, 1864, the, american, hoyle, describes, three, new, variants, muggins, bergen, and, rounce, alongside, the, block, dominoes, and, draw, dominoes, in, muggins, the, cribbage, board, was, dropped, 5, spots, scored, 5, points, and, game, was, now, 200, for, two, players, and, 150, for, three, or, four, despite, the, name, there, was, no, muggins, rule, as, in, cribbage, to, challenge, a, player, who, fails, to, declare, his, scoring, combinations, this, omission, was, rectified, in, the, 1868, edition, of, the, modern, pocket, hoyle, but, reprints, of, both, rule, sets, continued, to, be, produced, in, parallel, for, around, twenty, years, before, the, version, with, the, muggins, rule, prevailed, from, around, 1871, however, the, names, of, all, fives, and, muggins, became, conflated, and, many, publications, issued, rules, for, muggins, or, all, fives, or, muggins, or, fives, without, making, any, distinction, between, the, two, this, confusion, continues, to, the, present, day, with, some, publications, equating, the, names, and, others, describing, all, fives, as, a, separate, game, in, 1889, dominoes, was, described, as, having, spread, worldwide, but, nowhere, is, it, more, popular, than, in, the, caf, s, of, france, and, belgium, from, the, outset, the, european, game, was, different, from, the, chinese, one, european, domino, sets, contain, neither, the, military, civilian, suit, distinctions, of, chinese, dominoes, nor, the, duplicates, that, went, with, them, moreover, according, to, michael, dummett, in, the, chinese, games, it, is, only, the, identity, of, the, tile, that, matters, there, is, no, concept, of, matching, instead, the, basic, set, of, 28, unique, tiles, contains, seven, additional, pieces, six, of, them, representing, the, values, that, result, from, throwing, a, single, die, with, the, other, half, of, the, tile, left, blank, and, the, seventh, domino, representing, the, blank, blank, 0, 0, combination, subsequently, 45, piece, double, eight, sets, appeared, in, austria, and, in, recent, times, 55, piece, double, nine, and, 91, piece, double, twelve, sets, have, been, produced, all, the, early, games, are, still, played, today, alongside, games, that, have, sprung, up, in, the, last, 60, years, such, as, five, up, mexican, train, and, chicken, foot, the, last, two, taking, advantage, of, the, larger, domino, sets, available, some, modern, descriptions, of, all, fives, are, quite, different, from, the, original, having, lost, much, of, their, cribbage, character, and, incorporating, a, single, spinner, making, it, identical, or, closely, related, to, sniff, most, published, rule, sets, for, muggins, include, the, rule, that, gives, the, game, its, name, but, some, modern, publications, omit, it, even, though, the, muggins, rule, has, been, described, as, the, unique, feature, of, this, game, dominoes, is, now, played, internationally, it, is, recognized, as, an, ingrained, cultural, activity, within, the, caribbean, but, is, also, popular, with, the, windrush, generation, who, have, caribbean, heritage, in, the, uk, in, the, u, s, state, of, alabama, although, rarely, prosecuted, it, was, illegal, to, play, dominoes, on, sunday, within, the, state, until, the, relevant, section, of, the, alabama, criminal, code, was, repealed, effective, april, 21, 2015, dominoes, also, known, as, bones, cards, men, pieces, or, tiles, are, normally, twice, as, long, as, they, are, wide, which, makes, it, easier, to, re, stack, pieces, after, use, a, domino, usually, features, a, line, in, the, middle, to, divide, it, visually, into, two, squares, called, ends, the, value, of, either, side, is, the, number, of, spots, or, pips, in, the, most, common, variant, double, six, the, values, range, from, six, pips, down, to, none, or, blank, the, sum, of, the, two, values, i, e, the, total, number, of, pips, may, be, referred, to, as, the, rank, or, weight, of, a, tile, a, tile, may, be, described, as, heavier, than, a, lighter, one, that, has, fewer, or, no, pips, tiles, are, generally, named, after, their, two, values, for, instance, the, following, are, descriptions, of, the, tile, bearing, the, values, two, and, five, a, tile, that, has, the, same, pips, value, on, each, end, is, called, a, double, or, doublet, and, is, typically, referred, to, as, double, zero, double, one, and, so, on, conversely, a, tile, bearing, different, values, is, called, a, single, every, tile, which, features, a, given, number, is, a, member, of, the, suit, of, that, number, a, single, tile, is, a, member, of, two, suits, for, example, belongs, both, to, the, suit, of, threes, and, the, suit, of, blanks, or, 0, suit, in, some, versions, the, doubles, can, be, treated, as, an, additional, suit, of, doubles, in, these, versions, the, belongs, both, to, the, suit, of, sixes, and, the, suit, of, doubles, however, the, dominant, approach, is, that, each, double, belongs, to, only, one, suit, the, most, common, domino, sets, commercially, available, are, double, six, with, 28, tiles, and, double, nine, with, 55, tiles, larger, sets, exist, and, are, popular, for, games, involving, several, players, or, for, players, looking, for, long, domino, games, the, number, of, tiles, in, a, double, n, set, obeys, the, following, formula, which, is, also, the, n, 1, th, triangular, number, as, in, the, following, table, this, formula, can, be, simplified, a, little, bit, when, n, displaystyle, n, is, made, equal, to, the, total, number, of, doubles, in, the, domino, set, n, n, 1, 2, displaystyle, frac, n, n, 1, 2, the, total, number, of, pips, in, a, double, n, set, is, found, by, n, n, 1, n, 2, 2, displaystyle, frac, n, n, 1, n, 2, 2, i, e, the, number, of, tiles, multiplied, by, the, maximum, pip, count, n, e, g, a, 6, 6, set, has, 7, 8, 2, 56, 2, 28, tiles, the, average, number, of, pips, per, tile, is, 6, range, is, from, 0, to, 12, giving, a, total, pip, count, of, 6, 28, 168, the, most, popular, type, of, play, are, layout, games, which, fall, into, two, main, categories, blocking, games, and, scoring, games, the, most, basic, domino, variant, is, for, two, players, and, requires, a, double, six, set, the, 28, tiles, are, shuffled, face, down, and, form, the, stock, or, boneyard, each, player, draws, seven, tiles, from, the, stock, once, the, players, begin, drawing, tiles, they, are, typically, placed, on, edge, in, front, of, the, players, so, players, can, see, their, own, tiles, but, not, the, value, of, their, opponents, tiles, players, can, thus, see, how, many, tiles, remain, in, their, opponents, hands, at, all, times, one, player, begins, by, downing, playing, the, first, tile, one, of, their, tiles, this, tile, starts, the, line, of, play, in, which, values, of, adjacent, pairs, of, tile, ends, must, match, the, players, alternately, extend, the, line, of, play, with, one, tile, at, one, of, its, two, ends, if, a, player, is, unable, to, place, a, valid, tile, they, must, continue, drawing, tiles, from, the, stock, until, they, are, able, to, place, a, tile, the, game, ends, when, one, player, wins, by, playing, their, last, tile, or, when, the, game, is, blocked, because, neither, player, can, play, if, that, occurs, whoever, caused, the, block, receives, all, of, the, remaining, player, points, not, counting, their, own, a, common, variant, of, the, blocking, game, that, is, played, in, the, middle, east, features, four, players, with, slightly, altered, rules, the, stock, is, divided, equally, on, all, players, each, having, seven, tiles, in, hand, after, drawing, the, tiles, the, player, with, the, double, six, tile, starts, by, downing, that, tile, on, the, table, and, the, game, then, proceeds, counter, clockwise, since, there, is, no, boneyard, a, player, without, a, matching, tile, passes, their, turn, a, player, that, is, unable, to, play, is, called, a, downed, or, sitting, player, a, less, common, alternation, of, the, middle, eastern, game, requires, the, player, to, the, left, of, the, sitting, player, to, transfer, one, of, their, tiles, not, necessarily, playable, tile, to, the, downed, player, in, this, variant, if, the, transferred, tile, can, be, played, they, have, to, down, it, similar, to, a, normal, blocking, game, the, game, ends, when, a, player, empties, their, hand, or, the, game, is, blocked, if, the, game, is, blocked, the, player, with, the, lightest, hand, receives, points, equal, to, the, sum, of, all, losing, players, hands, a, set, of, games, ends, when, any, player, reaches, a, set, amount, of, points, in, which, they, win, if, no, player, reached, a, winning, score, the, winning, player, from, the, previous, round, starts, the, next, game, with, any, tile, in, their, hand, and, the, game, proceeds, normally, another, variant, of, the, blocking, game, is, the, latin, american, version, and, is, played, in, teams, of, two, the, stock, is, divided, equally, among, all, players, each, having, seven, tiles, in, hand, players, sitting, on, opposite, ends, of, the, table, are, part, of, the, same, team, the, game, ends, when, one, of, the, players, has, no, tiles, left, or, when, the, game, is, blocked, in, the, first, case, the, team, of, the, player, without, any, tiles, left, earns, the, sum, of, the, points, left, in, the, opposing, teams, hands, when, the, game, is, blocked, the, team, with, the, least, points, in, its, hands, earns, the, points, left, in, the, opposing, teams, hands, if, both, teams, have, the, same, points, the, team, that, started, wins, the, round, players, accrue, points, during, game, play, for, certain, configurations, moves, or, emptying, one, s, hand, most, scoring, games, use, variations, of, the, draw, game, if, a, player, does, not, call, domino, before, the, tile, is, laid, on, the, table, and, another, player, says, domino, after, the, tile, is, laid, the, first, player, must, pick, up, an, extra, domino, in, a, draw, game, blocking, or, scoring, players, are, additionally, allowed, to, draw, as, many, tiles, as, desired, from, the, stock, before, playing, a, tile, and, they, are, not, allowed, to, pass, before, the, stock, is, nearly, empty, the, score, of, a, game, is, the, number, of, pips, in, the, losing, player, s, hand, plus, the, number, of, pips, in, the, stock, most, rules, prescribe, that, two, tiles, need, to, remain, in, the, stock, the, draw, game, is, often, referred, to, as, simply, dominoes, adaptations, of, both, games, can, accommodate, more, than, two, players, who, may, play, individually, or, in, teams, the, line, of, play, is, the, configuration, of, played, tiles, on, the, table, it, starts, with, a, single, tile, and, typically, grows, in, two, opposite, directions, when, players, add, matching, tiles, in, practice, players, often, play, tiles, at, right, angles, when, the, line, of, play, gets, too, close, to, the, edge, of, the, table, the, rules, for, the, line, of, play, often, differ, from, one, variant, to, another, in, many, rules, the, doubles, serve, as, spinners, i, e, they, can, be, played, on, all, four, sides, causing, the, line, of, play, to, branch, sometimes, the, first, tile, is, required, to, be, a, double, which, serves, as, the, only, spinner, in, some, games, such, as, chicken, foot, all, sides, of, a, spinner, must, be, occupied, before, anybody, is, allowed, to, play, elsewhere, matador, has, unusual, rules, for, matching, bendomino, uses, curved, tiles, so, one, side, of, the, line, of, play, or, both, may, be, blocked, for, geometrical, reasons, in, mexican, train, and, other, train, games, the, game, starts, with, a, spinner, from, which, various, trains, branch, off, most, trains, are, owned, by, a, player, and, in, most, situations, players, are, allowed, to, extend, only, their, own, train, in, blocking, games, scoring, happens, at, the, end, of, the, game, after, a, player, has, emptied, their, hand, thereby, winning, the, game, for, the, team, the, score, consists, of, the, total, pip, count, of, the, losing, team, s, hands, in, some, rules, the, pip, count, of, the, remaining, stock, is, added, if, a, game, is, blocked, because, no, player, can, move, the, winner, is, often, determined, by, adding, the, pips, in, players, hands, in, scoring, games, each, individual, can, potentially, add, to, the, score, for, example, in, bergen, players, score, two, points, whenever, they, cause, a, configuration, in, which, both, open, ends, have, the, same, value, and, three, points, if, additionally, one, open, end, is, formed, by, a, double, in, muggins, players, score, by, ensuring, the, total, pip, count, of, the, open, ends, is, a, multiple, of, a, certain, number, in, variants, of, muggins, the, line, of, play, may, branch, due, to, spinners, in, the, common, u, s, variant, known, as, fives, players, score, by, making, the, open, ends, a, multiple, of, five, in, british, public, houses, and, social, clubs, a, scoring, version, of, 5s, and, 3s, is, used, the, game, is, normally, played, in, pairs, two, against, two, and, is, played, as, a, series, of, ends, in, each, end, the, objective, is, for, players, to, attach, a, domino, from, their, hand, to, one, end, of, those, already, played, so, that, the, sum, of, the, end, tiles, is, divisible, by, five, or, three, one, point, is, scored, for, each, time, five, or, three, can, be, divided, into, the, sum, of, the, two, tiles, i, e, four, at, one, end, and, five, at, the, other, makes, nine, which, is, divisible, by, three, three, times, resulting, in, three, points, double, five, at, one, end, and, five, at, the, other, makes, 15, which, is, divisible, by, three, five, times, five, points, and, divisible, by, five, three, times, three, points, for, a, total, of, eight, points, an, end, stops, when, one, of, the, players, is, out, i, e, has, played, all, of, their, tiles, in, the, event, no, player, is, able, to, empty, their, hand, then, the, player, with, the, lowest, domino, left, in, hand, is, deemed, to, be, out, and, scores, one, point, a, game, consists, of, any, number, of, ends, with, points, scored, in, the, ends, accumulating, towards, a, total, the, game, ends, when, one, of, the, pair, s, total, score, exceeds, a, set, number, of, points, a, running, total, score, is, often, kept, on, a, cribbage, board, 5s, and, 3s, is, played, in, a, number, of, competitive, leagues, in, the, british, isles, apart, from, the, usual, blocking, and, scoring, games, games, of, a, very, different, character, are, also, played, with, dominoes, such, as, solitaire, or, trick, taking, games, most, of, these, are, adaptations, of,
