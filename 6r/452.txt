modern, age, of, gymnastics, both, men, s, and, women, s, gymnastics, now, attract, considerable, international, interest, and, excellent, gymnasts, can, be, found, on, every, continent, in, 2006, a, new, points, system, for, artistic, gymnastics, was, put, into, play, an, a, score, or, d, score, is, the, difficulty, score, which, as, of, 2009, derives, from, the, eight, highest, scoring, elements, in, a, routine, excluding, vault, in, addition, to, the, points, awarded, for, composition, requirements, each, vault, has, a, difficulty, score, assigned, by, the, fig, the, b, score, or, e, score, is, the, score, for, execution, and, is, given, for, how, well, the, skills, are, performed, the, following, disciplines, are, governed, by, fig, artistic, gymnastics, is, usually, divided, into, men, s, and, women, s, gymnastics, men, compete, on, six, events, floor, exercise, pommel, horse, still, rings, vault, parallel, bars, and, horizontal, bar, while, women, compete, on, four,

ussr, in, 2006, fig, introduced, a, new, point, system, for, artistic, gymnastics, in, which, scores, are, no, longer, limited, to, 10, points, the, system, is, used, in, the, us, for, elite, level, competition, unlike, the, old, code, of, points, there, are, two, separate, scores, an, execution, score, and, a, difficulty, score, in, the, previous, system, the, execution, score, was, the, only, score, it, was, and, still, is, out, of, 10, 00, except, for, short, exercises, during, the, gymnast, s, performance, the, judges, deduct, this, score, only, a, fall, on, or, off, the, apparatus, is, a, 1, 00, deduction, in, elite, level, gymnastics, the, introduction, of, the, difficulty, score, is, a, significant, change, the, gymnast, s, difficulty, score, is, based, on, what, elements, they, perform, and, is, subject, to, change, if, they, do, not, perform, or, complete, all, the, skills, or, they, do, not, connect, a, skill, meant, to, be, connected, to, another, connection, bonuses, are, where, deviation, happens, most, commonly, between, the, intended, and, actual, difficulty, scores, as, it, can, be, difficult, to, connect, multiple, flight, elements, it, is, very, hard, to, connect, skills, if, the, first, skill, is, not, performed, correctly, the, new, code, of, points, allows, the, gymnasts, to, gain, higher, scores, based, on, the, difficulty, of, the, skills, they, perform, as, well, as, their, execution, there, is, no, maximum, score, for, difficulty, as, it, can, keep, increasing, as, the, difficulty, of, the, skills, increase, in, the, vaulting, events, gymnasts, sprint, down, a, 25, metres, 82, ft, runway, to, take, off, onto, a, vault, board, or, perform, a, roundoff, or, handspring, entry, onto, a, vault, board, to, land, momentarily, inverted, on, the, hands, on, the, vaulting, horse, or, vaulting, table, pre, flight, segment, then, propel, themselves, forward, or, backward, off, that, platform, to, a, two, footed, landing, post, flight, segment, every, gymnast, starts, at, a, different, point, on, the, vault, runway, depending, on, their, height, and, strength, the, post, flight, segment, may, include, one, or, more, multiple, saltos, or, twisting, movements, a, round, off, entry, vault, called, a, yurchenko, is, a, commonly, performed, vault, in, the, higher, levels, in, gymnastics, when, performing, a, yurchenko, gymnasts, round, off, so, their, hands, are, on, the, runway, while, their, feet, land, on, the, vault, board, from, the, round, off, position, the, gymnast, travels, backward, so, that, the, hands, land, on, the, vaulting, table, the, gymnast, then, blocks, off, the, vaulting, platform, into, various, twisting, and, or, somersaulting, combinations, the, post, flight, segment, brings, the, gymnast, to, her, feet, less, difficult, vaults, include, taking, off, from, the, vault, board, with, both, feet, at, the, same, time, and, either, doing, a, front, handspring, or, round, off, onto, the, vaulting, table, in, 2001, the, traditional, vaulting, horse, was, replaced, with, a, new, apparatus, sometimes, known, as, a, tongue, horse, or, vaulting, table, the, new, apparatus, is, more, stable, wider, and, longer, than, the, older, vaulting, horse, approximately, 1, m, in, length, and, 1, m, in, width, giving, gymnasts, a, larger, blocking, surface, this, apparatus, is, thus, considered, safer, than, the, vaulting, horse, used, in, the, past, with, the, addition, of, this, new, safer, vaulting, table, gymnasts, are, attempting, more, difficult, vaults, on, the, uneven, bars, the, gymnast, performs, a, timed, routine, on, two, parallel, horizontal, bars, set, at, different, heights, these, bars, are, made, of, fiberglass, covered, in, wood, laminate, to, prevent, them, from, breaking, in, the, past, bars, were, made, of, wood, but, the, bars, were, prone, to, breaking, providing, an, incentive, to, switch, to, newer, technologies, the, height, of, the, bars, may, be, adjusted, by, 5, cm, to, the, size, needed, by, individual, gymnasts, although, the, distance, between, bars, cannot, be, changed, for, individual, gymnasts, in, elite, competition, in, the, past, the, uneven, parallel, bars, were, closer, together, the, bars, have, been, moved, increasingly, further, apart, allowing, gymnasts, to, perform, swinging, circling, transitional, and, release, moves, that, may, pass, over, under, and, between, the, two, bars, at, the, elite, level, movements, must, pass, through, the, handstand, gymnasts, often, mount, the, uneven, bars, using, a, springboard, or, a, small, mat, gymnasts, may, use, chalk, mgco, 3, and, grips, a, leather, strip, with, holes, for, fingers, to, protect, hands, and, improve, performance, when, performing, this, event, the, chalk, helps, take, the, moisture, out, of, gymnasts, hands, to, decrease, friction, and, prevent, rips, tears, to, the, skin, of, the, hands, dowel, grips, help, gymnasts, grip, the, bar, the, gymnast, performs, a, choreographed, routine, of, up, to, 90, seconds, in, length, consisting, of, leaps, acrobatic, skills, somersaults, turns, and, dance, elements, on, a, padded, beam, the, beam, is, 125, centimetres, 4, ft, 1, in, from, the, ground, 5, metres, 16, ft, 5, in, long, and, 10, 16, centimetres, 4, 00, in, wide, this, stationary, object, can, also, be, adjusted, to, be, raised, higher, or, lower, the, gymnast, begins, the, 70, 90, seconds, exercise, by, mounting, the, beam, by, either, a, vault, or, a, jump, the, event, requires, balance, flexibility, grace, poise, and, strength, the, event, in, gymnastics, performed, on, the, floor, is, called, floor, exercise, the, english, abbreviation, for, the, event, in, gymnastics, scoring, is, fx, in, the, past, the, floor, exercise, event, was, executed, on, the, bare, floor, or, mats, such, as, wrestling, mats, the, floor, event, now, occurs, on, a, carpeted, 12m, 12m, square, usually, consisting, of, hard, foam, over, a, layer, of, plywood, which, is, supported, by, springs, generally, called, a, spring, floor, this, provides, a, firm, surface, that, provides, extra, bounce, or, spring, when, compressed, allowing, gymnasts, to, achieve, greater, height, and, a, softer, landing, after, the, composed, skill, gymnasts, perform, a, choreographed, routine, for, up, to, 90, seconds, in, the, floor, exercise, event, depending, on, the, level, the, gymnast, may, choose, their, own, routine, however, some, levels, have, compulsory, routines, where, default, music, must, be, played, levels, three, to, six, the, music, is, the, same, for, each, levels, along, with, the, skills, within, the, routine, however, recently, the, levels, have, switched, now, levels, 6, 10, are, optional, levels, and, they, get, to, have, custom, routines, made, in, the, optional, levels, levels, six, to, ten, there, are, skill, requirements, for, the, routine, but, the, athlete, is, able, to, pick, her, own, music, without, any, words, the, routine, should, consist, of, tumbling, passes, series, of, jumps, leaps, dance, elements, acrobatic, skills, and, turns, or, pivots, on, one, foot, a, gymnast, can,

met, levels, 9, and, 10, and, ncaa, gymnastics, all, start, below, a, 10, 0, and, require, gymnastics, to, acquire, bonus, points, through, connections, and, skills, to, increase, their, start, value, to, a, 10, 0, during, a, routine, deductions, will, be, made, by, the, judges, for, flaws, in, the, form, of, the, technique, of, a, skill, for, example, steps, on, landings, or, flexed, feet, can, range, from, 05, 1, off, depending, on, the, severity, of, the, mistake, male, gymnasts, also, perform, on, a, 12meter, x, 12meter, spring, floor, a, series, of, tumbling, passes, are, performed, to,
