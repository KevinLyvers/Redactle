butter, is, a, dairy, product, made, from, the, fat, and, protein, components, of, churned, cream, it, is, a, semi, solid, emulsion, at, room, temperature, consisting, of, approximately, 80, butterfat, it, is, used, at, room, temperature, as, a, spread, melted, as, a, condiment, and, used, as, a, fat, in, baking, sauce, making, pan, frying, and, other, cooking, procedures, most, frequently, made, from, cow, s, milk, butter, can, also, be, manufactured, from, the, milk, of, other, mammals, including, sheep, goats, buffalo, and, yaks, it, is, made, by, churning, milk, or, cream, to, separate, the, fat, globules, from, the, buttermilk, salt, has, been, added, to, butter, since, antiquity, to, help, preserve, it, particularly, when, being, transported, salt, may, still, play, a, preservation, role, but, is, less, important, today, as, the, entire, supply, chain, is, usually, refrigerated, in, modern, times, salt, may, be, added, for, taste, food, coloring, is, sometimes, added, to, butter, rendering, butter, removing, the, water, and, milk, solids, produces, clarified, butter, or, ghee, which, is, almost, entirely, butterfat, butter, is, a, water, in, oil, emulsion, resulting, from, an, inversion, of, the, cream, where, the, milk, proteins, are, the, emulsifiers, butter, remains, a, firm, solid, when, refrigerated, but, softens, to, a, spreadable, consistency, at, room, temperature, and, melts, to, a, thin, liquid, consistency, at, 32, to, 35, c, 90, to, 95, f, the, density, of, butter, is, 911, g, l, 15, 1, 4, oz, us, pt, it, generally, has, a, pale, yellow, color, but, varies, from, deep, yellow, to, nearly, white, its, natural, unmodified, color, is, dependent, on, the, source, animal, s, feed, and, genetics, but, the, commercial, manufacturing, process, sometimes, alters, this, with, food, colorings, like, annatto, or, carotene, the, word, butter, derives, via, germanic, languages, from, the, latin, butyrum, which, is, the, latinisation, of, the, greek, bouturon, this, may, be, a, compound, of, bous, ox, cow, turos, cheese, that, is, cow, cheese, the, word, turos, cheese, is, attested, in, mycenaean, greek, the, latinized, form, is, found, in, the, name, butyric, acid, a, compound, found, in, rancid, butter, and, other, dairy, products, unhomogenized, milk, and, cream, contain, butterfat, in, microscopic, globules, these, globules, are, surrounded, by, membranes, made, of, phospholipids, fatty, acid, emulsifiers, and, proteins, which, prevent, the, fat, in, milk, from, pooling, together, into, a, single, mass, butter, is, produced, by, agitating, cream, which, damages, these, membranes, and, allows, the, milk, fats, to, conjoin, separating, from, the, other, parts, of, the, cream, variations, in, the, production, method, will, create, butters, with, different, consistencies, mostly, due, to, the, butterfat, composition, in, the, finished, product, butter, contains, fat, in, three, separate, forms, free, butterfat, butterfat, crystals, and, undamaged, fat, globules, in, the, finished, product, different, proportions, of, these, forms, result, in, different, consistencies, within, the, butter, butters, with, many, crystals, are, harder, than, butters, dominated, by, free, fats, churning, produces, small, butter, grains, floating, in, the, water, based, portion, of, the, cream, this, watery, liquid, is, called, buttermilk, although, the, buttermilk, most, commonly, sold, today, is, instead, directly, fermented, skimmed, milk, the, buttermilk, is, drained, off, sometimes, more, buttermilk, is, removed, by, rinsing, the, grains, with, water, then, the, grains, are, worked, pressed, and, kneaded, together, when, prepared, manually, this, is, done, using, wooden, boards, called, scotch, hands, this, consolidates, the, butter, into, a, solid, mass, and, breaks, up, embedded, pockets, of, buttermilk, or, water, into, tiny, droplets, commercial, butter, is, about, 80, butterfat, and, 15, water, traditionally, made, butter, may, have, as, little, as, 65, fat, and, 30, water, butterfat, is, a, mixture, of, triglyceride, a, triester, derived, from, glycerol, and, three, of, any, of, several, fatty, acid, groups, annatto, is, sometimes, added, by, u, s, butter, manufacturers, without, declaring, it, on, the, label, because, the, u, s, allows, butter, to, have, an, undisclosed, flavorless, and, natural, coloring, agent, whereas, all, other, foods, in, the, u, s, must, label, coloring, agents, the, preservative, lactic, acid, is, sometimes, added, instead, of, salt, and, as, a, flavor, enhancer, and, sometimes, additional, diacetyl, is, added, to, boost, the, buttery, flavor, in, the, u, s, both, ingredients, can, be, listed, simply, as, natural, flavors, when, used, together, in, the, nizo, manufacturing, method, these, two, flavorings, produce, the, flavor, of, cultured, butter, without, actually, fully, fermenting, before, modern, factory, butter, making, cream, was, usually, collected, from, several, milkings, and, was, therefore, several, days, old, and, somewhat, fermented, by, the, time, it, was, made, into, butter, butter, made, in, this, traditional, way, from, a, fermented, cream, is, known, as, cultured, butter, during, fermentation, the, cream, naturally, sours, as, bacteria, convert, milk, sugars, into, lactic, acid, the, fermentation, process, produces, additional, aroma, compounds, including, diacetyl, which, makes, for, a, fuller, flavored, and, more, buttery, tasting, product, 35, butter, made, from, fresh, cream, is, called, sweet, cream, butter, production, of, sweet, cream, butter, first, became, common, in, the, 19th, century, when, the, development, of, refrigeration, and, the, mechanical, cream, separator, 33, made, sweet, cream, butter, faster, and, cheaper, to, produce, at, scale, sweet, cream, butter, can, be, made, in, 6, hours, whereas, cultured, butter, can, take, up, to, 72, hours, to, make, cultured, butter, is, preferred, throughout, continental, europe, while, sweet, cream, butter, dominates, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, chef, jansen, chan, the, director, of, pastry, operations, at, the, international, culinary, center, in, manhattan, says, it, s, no, secret, that, dairy, in, france, and, most, of, europe, is, higher, quality, than, most, of, the, u, s, the, combination, of, butter, culturing, the, 82, butterfat, minimum, as, opposed, to, the, 80, minimum, in, the, u, s, and, the, fact, that, french, butter, is, grass, fed, accounts, for, why, french, pastry, and, french, food, in, general, has, a, reputation, for, being, richer, tasting, and, flakier, cultured, butter, is, sometimes, labeled, european, style, butter, in, the, united, states, although, cultured, butter, is, made, and, sold, by, some, especially, amish, dairies, milk, that, is, to, be, made, into, butter, is, usually, pasteurized, during, production, to, kill, pathogenic, bacteria, and, other, microbes, butter, made, from, raw, milk, is, very, rare, and, can, be, dangerous, because, it, is, made, from, unpasteurized, milk, commercial, raw, milk, products, are, not, legal, to, sell, through, interstate, commerce, in, the, united, states, and, very, rare, in, europe, 34, raw, cream, butter, is, generally, only, found, made, at, home, by, consumers, who, have, purchased, raw, whole, milk, directly, from, dairy, farmers, skimmed, the, cream, themselves, and, made, butter, with, it, clarified, butter, has, almost, all, of, its, water, and, milk, solids, removed, leaving, almost, pure, butterfat, clarified, butter, is, made, by, heating, butter, to, its, melting, point, and, then, allowing, it, to, cool, after, settling, the, remaining, components, separate, by, density, at, the, top, whey, proteins, form, a, skin, which, is, removed, the, resulting, butterfat, is, then, poured, off, from, the, mixture, of, water, and, casein, proteins, that, settle, to, the, bottom, 37, ghee, is, clarified, butter, that, has, been, heated, to, around, 120, c, 250, f, after, the, water, evaporated, turning, the, milk, solids, brown, this, process, flavors, the, ghee, and, also, produces, antioxidants, that, help, protect, it, from, rancidity, because, of, this, ghee, can, be, kept, for, six, to, eight, months, under, normal, conditions, 37, cream, may, be, separated, usually, by, a, centrifuge, or, a, sedimentation, from, whey, instead, of, milk, as, a, byproduct, of, cheese, making, whey, butter, may, be, made, from, whey, cream, whey, cream, and, butter, have, a, lower, fat, content, and, taste, more, salty, tangy, and, cheesy, they, are, also, cheaper, to, make, than, sweet, cream, and, butter, the, fat, content, of, whey, is, low, so, 1000, pounds, of, whey, will, typically, give, only, three, pounds, of, butter, there, are, several, butters, produced, in, europe, with, protected, geographical, indications, these, include, elaine, khosrova, traces, the, invention, of, butter, back, to, neolithic, era, africa, 8, 000, b, c, in, her, book, a, later, sumerian, tablet, dating, to, approximately, 2, 500, b, c, describes, the, butter, making, process, from, the, milking, of, cattle, while, contemporary, sumerian, tablets, identify, butter, as, a, ritual, offering, in, the, mediterranean, climate, unclarified, butter, spoils, quickly, unlike, cheese, so, it, is, not, a, practical, method, of, preserving, the, nutrients, of, milk, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, seemed, to, have, considered, butter, a, food, fit, more, for, the, northern, barbarians, a, play, by, the, greek, comic, poet, anaxandrides, refers, to, thracians, as, boutyrophagoi, butter, eaters, in, his, natural, history, pliny, the, elder, calls, butter, the, most, delicate, of, food, among, barbarous, nations, and, goes, on, to, describe, its, medicinal, properties, later, the, physician, galen, also, described, butter, as, a, medicinal, agent, only, in, the, cooler, climates, of, northern, europe, people, could, store, butter, longer, before, it, spoiled, scandinavia, has, the, oldest, tradition, in, europe, of, butter, export, trade, dating, at, least, to, the, 12th, century, after, the, fall, of, rome, and, through, much, of, the, middle, ages, butter, was, a, common, food, across, most, of, europe, but, had, a, low, reputation, and, so, was, consumed, principally, by, peasants, butter, slowly, became, more, accepted, by, the, upper, class, notably, when, the, roman, catholic, church, allowed, its, consumption, during, lent, from, the, early, 16th, century, bread, and, butter, became, common, fare, among, the, middle, class, and, the, english, in, particular, gained, a, reputation, for, their, liberal, use, of, melted, butter, as, a, sauce, with, meat, and, vegetables, 33, in, antiquity, butter, was, used, for, fuel, in, lamps, as, a, substitute, for, oil, the, butter, tower, of, rouen, cathedral, was, erected, in, the, early, 16th, century, when, archbishop, georges, d, amboise, authorized, the, burning, of, butter, during, lent, instead, of, oil, which, was, scarce, at, the, time, across, northern, europe, butter, was, sometimes, packed, into, barrels, firkins, and, buried, in, peat, bogs, perhaps, for, years, such, bog, butter, would, develop, a, strong, flavor, as, it, aged, but, remain, edible, in, large, part, because, of, the, cool, airless, antiseptic, and, acidic, environment, of, a, peat, bog, firkins, of, such, buried, butter, are, a, common, archaeological, find, in, ireland, the, national, museum, of, ireland, archaeology, has, some, containing, a, grayish, cheese, like, substance, partially, hardened, not, much, like, butter, and, quite, free, from, putrefaction, the, practice, was, most, common, in, ireland, in, the, 11th, 14th, centuries, it, ended, entirely, before, the, 19th, century, until, the, 19th, century, the, vast, majority, of, butter, was, made, by, hand, on, farms, butter, also, provided, extra, income, to, farm, families, they, used, wood, presses, with, carved, decoration, to, press, butter, into, pucks, or, small, bricks, to, sell, at, nearby, markets, or, general, stores, the, decoration, identified, the, farm, that, produced, the, butter, this, practice, continued, until, production, was, mechanized, and, butter, was, produced, in, less, decorative, stick, form, like, ireland, france, became, well, known, for, its, butter, particularly, in, normandy, and, brittany, butter, consumption, in, london, in, the, mid, 1840s, was, estimated, at, 15, 357, tons, annually, the, first, butter, factories, appeared, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1860s, after, the, successful, introduction, of, cheese, factories, a, decade, earlier, in, the, late, 1870s, the, centrifugal, cream, separator, was, introduced, marketed, most, successfully, by, swedish, engineer, carl, gustaf, patrik, de, laval, in, 1920, otto, hunziker, authored, the, butter, industry, prepared, for, factory, school, and, laboratory, a, well, known, text, in, the, industry, that, enjoyed, at, least, three, editions, 1920, 1927, 1940, as, part, of, the, efforts, of, the, american, dairy, science, association, hunziker, and, others, published, articles, regarding, causes, of, tallowiness, an, odor, defect, distinct, from, rancidity, a, taste, defect, mottles, an, aesthetic, issue, related, to, uneven, color, introduced, salts, the, impact, of, creamery, metals, and, liquids, and, acidity, measurement, these, and, other, adsa, publications, helped, standardize, practices, internationally, butter, consumption, declined, in, most, western, nations, during, the, 20th, century, mainly, because, of, the, rising, popularity, of, margarine, which, is, less, expensive, and, until, recent, years, was, perceived, as, being, healthier, in, the, united, states, margarine, consumption, overtook, butter, during, the, 1950s, and, it, is, still, the, case, today, that, more, margarine, than, butter, is, eaten, in, the, u, s, and, the, eu, in, 1997, india, produced, 1, 470, 000, metric, tons, 1, 620, 000, short,

regions, of, tibet, bhutan, nepal, and, india, it, consists, of, tea, served, with, intensely, flavored, or, rancid, yak, butter, and, salt, in, african, and, asian, nations, butter, is, sometimes, traditionally, made, from, sour, milk, rather, than, cream, it, can, take, several, hours, of, churning, to, produce, workable, butter, grains, from, fermented, milk, normal, butter, softens, to, a, spreadable, consistency, around, 15, c, 60, f, well, above, refrigerator, temperatures, the, butter, compartment, found, in, many, refrigerators, may, be, one, of, the, warmer, sections, inside, but, it, still, leaves, butter, quite, hard, until, recently, many, refrigerators, sold, in, new, zealand, featured, a, butter, conditioner, a, compartment, kept, warmer, than, the, rest, of, the, refrigerator, but, still, cooler, than, room, temperature, with, a, small, heater, keeping, butter, tightly, wrapped, delays, rancidity, which, is, hastened, by, exposure, to, light, or, air, and, also, helps, prevent, it, from, picking, up, other, odors, wrapped, butter, has, a, shelf, life, of, several, months, at, refrigerator, temperatures, butter, can, also, be, frozen, to, extend, its, storage, life, in, the, united, states, butter, has, traditionally, been, made, into, small, rectangular, blocks, by, means, of, a, pair, of, wooden, butter, paddles, it, is, usually, produced, in, 4, ounce, 1, 4, lb, 110, g, sticks, that, are, individually, wrapped, in, waxed, or, foiled, paper, and, sold, as, a, 1, pound, 0, 45, kg, package, of, 4, sticks, this, practice, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, 1907, when, swift, and, company, began, packaging, butter, in, this, manner, for, mass, distribution, due, to, historical, differences, in, butter, printers, machines, that, cut, and, package, butter, 4, ounce, sticks, are, commonly, produced, in, two, different, shapes, most, butter, dishes, are, designed, for, elgin, style, butter, sticks, outside, of, the, united, states, butter, is, measured, for, sale, by, mass, rather, than, by, volume, or, unit, stick, and, is, often, sold, in, 250, g, 8, 8, oz, and, 500, g, 18, oz, packages, since, the, 1940s, but, more, commonly, the, 1960s, butter, pats, have, been, individually, wrapped, and, packed, in, cardboard, boxes, prior, to, use, of, cardboard, butter, was, bulk, packed, in, wood, the, earliest, discoveries, used, firkins, from, about, 1882, wooden, boxes, were, used, as, the, introduction, of, refrigeration, on, ships, brought, about, longer, transit, times, butter, boxes, were, generally, made, with, woods, whose, resin, would, not, taint, the, butter, such, as, sycamore, kahikatea, hoop, pine, maple, or, spruce, they, commonly, weighed, a, firkin, 56, pounds, 25, kg, butter, has, been, considered, indispensable, in, french, cuisine, since, the, 17th, century, chefs, and, cooks, have, extolled, its, importance, fernand, point, said, donnez, moi, du, beurre, encore, du, beurre, toujours, du,

which, contains, enough, of, the, allergy, causing, proteins, to, cause, reactions, a, 2015, study, concluded, that, hypercholesterolemic, people, should, keep, their, consumption, of, butter, to, a, minimum, whereas, moderate, butter, intake, may, be, considered, part, of, the, diet, in, the, normocholesterolemic, population, a, meta, analysis, and, systematic, review, published, in, 2016, found, relatively, small, or, insignificant, overall, associations, of, a, dose, of, 14g, day, of, butter, with, mortality, and, cardiovascular, disease, and, consumption, was, insignificantly, inversely, associated, with, incidence, of, diabetes, the, study, states, that, findings, do, not, support, a, need, for, major, emphasis, in, dietary, guidelines, on, either, increasing, or, decreasing, butter, consumption
