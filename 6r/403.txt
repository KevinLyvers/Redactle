diving, is, the, sport, of, jumping, or, falling, into, water, from, a, platform, or, springboard, usually, while, performing, acrobatics, diving, is, an, internationally, recognized, sport, that, is, part, of, the, olympic, games, in, addition, unstructured, and, non, competitive, diving, is, a, recreational, pastime, competitors, possess, many, of, the, same, characteristics, as, gymnasts, and, dancers, including, strength, flexibility, kinaesthetic, judgment, and, air, awareness, some, professional, divers, were, originally, gymnasts, or, dancers, as, both, the, sports, have, similar, characteristics, to, diving, dmitri, sautin, holds, the, record, for, most, olympic, diving, medals, won, by, winning, eight, medals, in, total, between, 1992, and, 2008, in, the, tomb, of, hunting, and, fishing, there, is, a, wall, painting, from, around, 530, 500, bce, that, shows, a, person, climbing, rocks, towards, a, cliff, face, and, a, second, person, diving, down, the, cliff, face, towards, water, the, tomb, of, the, diver, in, paestum, contains, a, fresco, dating, to, around, 500, to, 475, bce, that, also, shows, a, scene, of, a, person, diving, into, a, pool, or, stream, of, water, from, a, structure, although, diving, has, been, a, popular, pastime, across, the, world, since, ancient, times, the, first, modern, diving, competitions, were, held, in, england, in, the, 1880s, the, exact, origins, of, the, sport, are, unclear, though, it, likely, derives, from, the, act, of, diving, at, the, start, of, swimming, races, in, the, seventeenth, century, gymnasts, moved, their, equipment, to, the, beaches, and, performed, acrobatics, over, the, water, the, 1904, book, swimming, by, ralph, thomas, notes, english, reports, of, plunging, records, dating, back, to, at, least, 1865, the, 1877, edition, to, british, rural, sports, by, john, henry, walsh, makes, note, of, a, mr, young, plunging, 56, feet, 17, m, in, 1870, and, also, states, that, 25, years, prior, a, swimmer, named, drake, could, cover, 53, feet, 16, m, the, english, amateur, swimming, association, at, the, time, called, the, swimming, association, of, great, britain, first, started, a, plunging, championship, in, 1883, the, plunging, championship, was, discontinued, in, 1937, diving, into, a, body, of, water, had, also, been, a, method, used, by, gymnasts, in, germany, and, sweden, since, the, early, 19th, century, the, soft, landing, allowed, for, more, elaborate, gymnastic, feats, in, midair, as, the, jump, could, be, made, from, a, greater, height, this, tradition, evolved, into, fancy, diving, while, diving, as, a, preliminary, to, swimming, became, known, as, plain, diving, in, england, the, practice, of, high, diving, diving, from, a, great, height, gained, popularity, the, first, diving, stages, were, erected, at, the, highgate, ponds, at, a, height, of, 15, feet, 4, 6, m, in, 1893, and, the, first, world, championship, event, the, national, graceful, diving, competition, was, held, there, by, the, royal, life, saving, society, in, 1895, the, event, consisted, of, standing, and, running, dives, from, either, 15, or, 30, feet, 4, 6, or, 9, 1, m, it, was, at, this, event, that, the, swedish, tradition, of, fancy, diving, was, introduced, to, the, sport, by, the, athletes, otto, hagborg, and, c, f, mauritzi, they, demonstrated, their, acrobatic, techniques, from, the, 10, m, diving, board, at, highgate, pond, and, stimulated, the, establishment, of, the, amateur, diving, association, in, 1901, the, first, organization, devoted, to, diving, in, the, world, later, amalgamated, with, the, amateur, swimming, association, fancy, diving, was, formally, introduced, into, the, championship, in, 1903, plain, diving, was, first, introduced, into, the, olympics, at, the, 1904, event, the, 1908, olympics, in, london, added, fancy, diving, and, introduced, elastic, boards, rather, than, fixed, platforms, women, were, first, allowed, to, participate, in, the, diving, events, for, the, 1912, olympics, in, stockholm, in, the, 1928, olympics, plain, and, fancy, diving, were, amalgamated, into, one, event, highboard, diving, the, diving, event, was, first, held, indoors, in, the, empire, pool, for, the, 1934, british, empire, games, and, 1948, summer, olympics, in, london, most, diving, competitions, consist, of, three, disciplines, 1, m, and, 3, m, springboards, and, the, platform, competitive, athletes, are, divided, by, gender, and, often, by, age, group, in, platform, events, competitors, are, allowed, to, perform, their, dives, on, either, the, five, seven, and, a, half, generally, just, called, seven, nine, or, ten, meter, towers, in, major, diving, meets, including, the, olympic, games, and, the, world, championships, platform, diving, is, from, the, 10, meter, height, divers, have, to, perform, a, set, number, of, dives, according, to, established, requirements, including, somersaults, and, twists, divers, are, judged, on, whether, and, how, well, they, completed, all, aspects, of, the, dive, the, conformance, of, their, body, to, the, requirements, of, the, dive, and, the, amount, of, splash, created, by, their, entry, to, the, water, a, possible, score, out, of, ten, is, broken, down, into, three, points, for, the, takeoff, meaning, the, hurdle, three, for, the, flight, the, actual, dive, and, three, for, the, entry, how, the, diver, hits, the, water, with, one, more, available, to, give, the, judges, flexibility, the, raw, score, is, multiplied, by, a, degree, of, difficulty, factor, derived, from, the, number, and, combination, of, movements, attempted, the, diver, with, the, highest, total, score, after, a, sequence, of, dives, is, declared, the, winner, synchronized, diving, was, adopted, as, an, olympic, sport, in, 2000, two, divers, form, a, team, and, perform, dives, simultaneously, the, dives, are, identical, it, used, to, be, possible, to, dive, opposites, also, known, as, a, pinwheel, but, this, is, no, longer, part, of, competitive, synchronized, diving, for, example, one, diver, would, perform, a, forward, dive, and, the, other, an, inward, dive, in, the, same, position, or, one, would, do, a, reverse, and, the, other, a, back, movement, in, these, events, the, diving, would, be, judged, both, on, the, quality, of, execution, and, the, synchronicity, in, timing, of, take, off, and, entry, height, and, forward, travel, there, are, rules, governing, the, scoring, of, a, dive, usually, a, score, considers, three, elements, of, the, dive, the, approach, the, flight, and, the, entry, the, primary, factors, affecting, the, scoring, are, each, dive, is, assigned, a, degree, of, difficulty, dd, which, is, determined, from, a, combination, of, the, moves, undertaken, position, used, and, height, the, dd, value, is, multiplied, by, the, scores, given, by, the, judges, to, reduce, the, subjectivity, of, scoring, in, major, meets, panels, of, five, or, seven, judges, are, assembled, major, international, events, such, as, the, olympics, use, seven, judge, panels, for, a, five, judge, panel, the, highest, and, lowest, scores, are, discarded, and, the, middle, three, are, summed, and, multiplied, by, the, dd, for, seven, judge, panels, as, of, the, 2012, london, olympics, the, two, highest, scores, and, two, lowest, are, discarded, leaving, three, to, be, summed, and, multiplied, by, the, dd, prior, to, the, london, olympics, the, highest, and, lowest, scores, were, eliminated, and, the, remaining, five, scores, were, multiplied, by, 3, 5, to, allow, for, comparison, to, five, judge, panels, the, canceling, of, scores, is, used, to, make, it, difficult, for, a, single, judge, to, manipulate, scores, there, is, a, general, misconception, about, scoring, and, judging, in, serious, meets, the, absolute, score, is, somewhat, meaningless, it, is, the, relative, score, not, the, absolute, score, that, wins, meets, accordingly, good, judging, implies, consistent, scoring, across, the, dives, specifically, if, a, judge, consistently, gives, low, scores, for, all, divers, or, consistently, gives, high, scores, for, the, same, divers, the, judging, will, yield, fair, relative, results, and, will, cause, divers, to, place, in, the, correct, order, however, absolute, scores, have, significance, to, the, individual, divers, besides, the, obvious, instances, of, setting, records, absolute, scores, are, also, used, for, rankings, and, qualifications, for, higher, level, meets, in, synchronised, diving, events, there, is, a, panel, of, seven, nine, or, eleven, judges, two, or, three, to, mark, the, execution, of, one, diver, two, or, three, to, mark, the, execution, of, the, other, and, the, remaining, three, or, five, to, judge, the, synchronisation, the, execution, judges, are, positioned, two, on, each, side, of, the, pool, and, they, score, the, diver, which, is, nearer, to, them, the, 2012, london, olympics, saw, the, first, use, of, eleven, judges, the, score, is, computed, similarly, to, the, scores, from, other, diving, events, but, has, been, modified, starting, with, the, 2012, london, olympics, for, the, use, of, the, larger, judging, panels, each, group, of, judges, will, have, the, highest, and, lowest, scores, dropped, leaving, the, middle, score, for, each, diver, s, execution, and, the, three, middle, scores, for, synchronization, the, total, is, then, weighted, by, 3, 5, and, multiplied, by, the, dd, the, result, is, that, the, emphasis, is, on, the, synchronization, of, the, divers, the, synchronisation, scores, are, based, on, the, judges, may, also, disqualify, the, diver, for, certain, violations, during, the, dive, including, to, win, dive, meets, divers, create, a, dive, list, in, advance, of, the, meet, to, win, the, meet, the, diver, must, accumulate, more, points, than, other, divers, often, simple, dives, with, low, dds, will, look, good, to, spectators, but, will, not, win, meets, the, competitive, diver, will, attempt, the, highest, dd, dives, possible, with, which, they, can, achieve, consistent, high, scores, if, divers, are, scoring, 8, or, 9, on, most, dives, it, may, be, a, sign, of, their, extreme, skill, or, it, may, be, a, sign, that, their, dive, list, is, not, competitive, and, they, may, lose, the, meet, to, a, diver, with, higher, dds, and, lower, scores, in, competition, divers, must, submit, their, lists, beforehand, and, once, past, a, deadline, usually, when, the, event, is, announced, or, shortly, before, it, begins, they, cannot, change, their, dives, if, they, fail, to, perform, the, dive, announced, even, if, they, physically, cannot, execute, the, dive, announced, or, if, they, perform, a, more, difficult, dive, they, will, receive, a, score, of, zero, under, exceptional, circumstances, a, redive, may, be, granted, but, these, are, exceedingly, rare, usually, for, very, young, divers, just, learning, how, to, compete, or, if, some, event, outside, the, diver, s, control, has, caused, them, to, be, unable, to, perform, such, as, a, loud, noise, in, the, olympics, or, other, highly, competitive, meets, many, divers, will, have, nearly, the, same, list, of, dives, as, their, competitors, the, importance, for, divers, competing, at, this, level, is, not, so, much, the, dd, but, how, they, arrange, their, list, once, the, more, difficult, rounds, of, dives, begin, it, is, important, to, lead, off, with, a, confident, dive, to, build, momentum, they, also, tend, to, put, a, very, confident, dive, in, front, of, a, very, difficult, dive, to, ensure, that, they, will, have, a, good, mentality, for, the, difficult, dive, most, divers, have, pre, dive, and, post, dive, rituals, that, help, them, either, maintain, or, regain, focus, coaches, also, play, a, role, in, this, aspect, of, the, sport, many, divers, rely, on, their, coaches, to, help, keep, their, composure, during, the, meet, in, a, large, meet, coaches, are, rarely, allowed, on, the, deck, to, talk, to, their, athlete, so, it, is, common, to, see, coaches, using, hand, gestures, or, body, movements, to, communicate, there, are, some, american, meets, which, will, allow, changes, of, the, position, of, the, dive, even, after, the, dive, has, been, announced, immediately, before, execution, but, these, are, an, exception, to, the, rules, generally, observed, internationally, generally, ncaa, rules, allow, for, dives, to, be, changed, while, the, diver, is, on, the, board, but, the, diver, must, request, the, change, directly, after, the, dive, is, announced, this, applies, especially, in, cases, where, the, wrong, dive, is, announced, if, the, diver, pauses, during, his, or, her, hurdle, to, ask, for, a, change, of, dive, it, will, be, declared, a, balk, when, the, diver, stops, mid, hurdle, and, the, change, of, dive, will, not, be, permitted, under, fina, law, no, dive, may, be, changed, after, the, deadline, for, the, dive, sheet, to, be, submitted, generally, a, period, ranging, from, one, hour, to, 24, hours, depending, on, the, rulings, made, by, the, event, organiser, it, is, the, diver, s, responsibility, to, ensure, that, the, dive, sheet, is, filled, in, correctly, and, also, to, correct, the, referee, or, announcer, before, the, dive, if, they, describe, it, incorrectly, if, a, dive, is, performed, which, is, as, submitted, but, not, as, incorrectly, announced, it, is, declared, failed, and, scores, zero, according, to, a, strict, reading, of, the, fina, law, but, in, practice, a, re, dive, would, usually, be, granted, in, these, circumstances, the, global, governing, body, of, diving, is, fina, which, also, governs, swimming, synchronised, swimming, water, polo, and, open, water, swimming, almost, invariably, at, national, level, diving, shares, a, governing, body, with, the, other, aquatic, sports, this, is, frequently, a, source, of, political, friction, as, the, committees, are, naturally, dominated, by, swimming, officials, who, do, not, necessarily, share, or, understand, the, concerns, of, the, diving, community, divers, often, feel, for, example, that, they, do, not, get, adequate, support, over, issues, like, the, provision, of, facilities, other, areas, of, concern, are, the, selection, of, personnel, for, the, specialised, diving, committees, and, for, coaching, and, officiating, at, events, and, the, team, selection, for, international, competitions, there, are, sometimes, attempts, to, separate, the, governing, body, as, a, means, to, resolve, these, frustrations, but, they, are, rarely, successful, for, example, in, the, uk, the, great, britain, diving, federation, was, formed, in, 1992, with, the, intention, of, taking, over, the, governance, of, diving, from, the, asa, amateur, swimming, association, although, it, initially, received, widespread, support, from, the, diving, community, the, fina, requirement, that, international, competitors, had, to, be, registered, with, their, national, governing, body, was, a, major, factor, in, the, abandonment, of, this, ambition, a, few, years, later, since, fina, refused, to, rescind, recognition, of, the, asa, as, the, british, governing, body, for, all, aquatic, sports, including, diving, this, meant, that, the, elite, divers, had, to, belong, to, asa, affiliated, clubs, to, be, eligible, for, selection, to, international, competition, in, the, united, states, scholastic, diving, is, almost, always, part, of, the, school, s, swim, team, diving, is, a, separate, sport, in, olympic, and, club, diving, the, ncaa, will, separate, diving, from, swimming, in, special, diving, competitions, after, the, swim, season, is, completed, after, an, incident, in, washington, in, 1993, most, us, and, other, pool, builders, are, reluctant, to, equip, a, residential, swimming, pool, with, a, diving, springboard, so, home, diving, pools, are, much, less, common, these, days, in, the, incident, 14, year, old, shawn, meneely, made, a, suicide, dive, holding, his, hands, at, his, sides, so, that, his, head, hit, the, bottom, first, in, a, private, swimming, pool, and, became, a, tetraplegic, the, lawyers, for, the, family, jan, eric, peterson, and, fred, zeder, successfully, sued, the, diving, board, manufacturer, the, pool, builder, and, the, national, spa, and, pool, institute, over, the, inappropriate, depth, of, the, pool, the, nspi, had, specified, a, minimum, depth, of, 7, ft, 6, in, 2, 29, m, which, proved, to, be, insufficient, in, the, above, case, the, pool, into, which, meneely, dived, was, not, constructed, to, the, published, standards, the, standards, had, changed, after, the, diving, board, was, installed, on, the, non, compliant, pool, by, the, homeowner, but, the, courts, held, that, the, pool, was, close, enough, to, the, standards, to, hold, nspi, liable, the, multimillion, dollar, lawsuit, was, eventually, resolved, in, 2001, for, us, 6, 6, million, 8, million, after, interest, was, added, in, favor, of, the, plaintiff, the, nspi, was, held, to, be, liable, and, was, financially, strained, by, the, case, it, filed, twice, for, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, protection, and, was, successfully, reorganized, into, a, new, swimming, pool, industry, association, it, has, been, commented, that, for, spinal, cord, injuries, related, to, diving, board, use, in, the, united, states, that, for, the, purposes, of, obtaining, rough, estimates, of, diving, board, related, injury, risks, the, estimated, rate, of, sci, due, to, diving, into, swimming, pools, from, diving, boards, to, be, on, the, order, of, 0, 028, per, 100, 000, swimmers, many, diving, accidents, occur, when, divers, do, not, account, for, submerged, objects, in, the, water, such, as, rocks, and, logs, because, of, this, many, beaches, and, pools, prohibit, diving, in, shallow, waters, or, when, a, lifeguard, is, not, on, duty, it, was, commetend, that, shallow, dives, can, end, up, in, death, or, permanent, injury, and, that, in, 1988, on, lake, powell, a, person, was, left, a, quadriplegic, after, diving, just, 5, feet, off, a, houseboat, into, the, murky, lake, water, resistance, increases, with, the, speed, of, entry, so, entering, the, water, at, high, velocity, induces, rapid, deceleration, jumping, into, water, from, a, height, of, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, results, in, a, person, impacting, with, the, water, surface, at, 25, mph, 40, km, h, impacting, with, the, water, surface, at, this, velocity, is, capable, of, giving, a, person, temporary, paralysis, of, the, diaphragm, a, compressed, spine, broken, bones, or, concussion, the, speed, that, a, diver, is, travelling, at, the, water, surface, when, they, dive, from, a, ten, metre, platform, is, around, 35mph, and, when, a, diver, hits, the, water, flat, from, 10, metres, they, are, brought, to, rest, in, about, 30, cm, 1, ft, the, extreme, deceleration, when, hitting, the, water, flat, at, around, 35mph, can, cause, severe, bruising, both, internal, and, external, strains, to, connective, tissue, securing, the, organs, possible, minor, hemorrhaging, to, lungs, and, other, tissues, possibly, resulting, in, a, person, coughing, up, blood, a, compressed, spine, broken, bones, or, concussion, this, is, very, painful, and, distressing, but, not, life, threatening, tom, daley, has, described, one, concussion, that, occurred, to, him, i, missed, my, hands, before, the, beijing, world, series, and, smashed, my, head, at, 35mph, on, to, the, water, the, concussion, resulted, in, him, receiving, headaches, nausea, dizziness, it, also, resulted, in, daley, being, out, of, action, for, six, days, and, left, him, unable, to, dive, off, his, competition, height, of, 10m, for, three, weeks, it, was, commented, that, in, 1989, a, 22, year, old, who, was, a, diver, and, a, member, of, the, salt, lake, country, club, diving, team, climbed, up, on, a, set, of, towering, rocks, about, 60, feet, 18, 2, metres, he, dove, into, the, water, doing, a, back, flip, he, never, surfaced, from, the, water, and, was, found, several, days, later, 120, feet, below, the, surface, the, 22, year, old, was, found, to, have, suffered, a, broken, neck, in, competitive, diving, fina, takes, regulatory, steps, to, ensure, that, athletes, are, protected, from, the, inherent, dangers, of, the, sport, for, example, they, impose, restrictions, according, to, age, on, the, heights, of, platforms, which, divers, may, compete, on, group, d, divers, have, only, recently, been, allowed, to, compete, on, the, tower, in, the, past, the, age, group, could, compete, only, springboard, to, discourage, children, from, taking, on, the, greater, risks, of, tower, diving, group, d, tower, was, introduced, to, counteract, the, phenomenon, of, coaches, pushing, young, divers, to, compete, in, higher, age, categories, thus, putting, them, at, even, greater, risk, however, some, divers, may, safely, dive, in, higher, age, categories, to, dive, on, higher, platforms, usually, this, occurs, when, advanced, group, c, divers, wish, to, compete, on, the, 10, m, points, on, pool, depths, in, connection, with, diving, safety, it, has, been, commented, that, competitive, diving, poses, unique, risks, for, both, traumatic, and, overuse, injuries, in, practice, and, competition, it, was, commented, further, that, head, cervical, spine, shoulder, and, lumbar, spine, injuries, among, others, are, not, uncommon, though, rates, vary, significantly, in, the, literature, existing, data, suggest, that, as, the, level, of, competition, elevates, traumatic, injuries, including, head, injury, become, relatively, less, common, while, overuse, injuries, predominate, it, has, also, been, commented, that, the, most, frequently, injured, areas, are, the, wrist, shoulder, and, lumbar, spine, when, looking, at, ncaa, swimming, and, diving, injuries, from, 2009, to, 2014, an, injury, rate, of, 1, 94, injuries, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, ae, for, males, and, 2, 49, injuries, per, 1000, ae, for, females, with, more, injuries, happening, during, practice, over, competition, it, has, also, been, found, that, 2, 1, of, divers, were, injured, in, the, 2008, olympics, 8, 1, of, divers, were, injured, in, the, 2012, olympics, it, was, further, found, that, during, the, fina, world, championships, of, 2015, 2013, and, 2009, older, athletes, in, the, diving, high, diving, and, water, polo, groups, were, in, the, highest, risk, group, for, injury, in, relation, to, springboard, diving, it, has, been, commented, that, the, injury, producing, forces, during, the, takeoff, are, related, to, jumping, and, deceleration, the, most, common, injuries, related, to, this, part, of, the, dive, are, patellar, tendinitis, patellar, tracking, problems, quadriceps, tendinitis, jumper, s, knee, and, patellofemoral, compression, syndrome, commonly, caused, by, repetitive, stress, placed, on, the, patellar, or, quadriceps, tendon, during, jumping, vertical, jump, ability, as, well, as, jumping, and, landing, technique, are, believed, to, influence, tendon, loading, it, has, also, been, commented, that, 10, metre, platform, diving, can, also, cause, repetitive, strain, injuries, from, repeatedly, pushing, off, the, concrete, platform, it, has, further, been, commented, that, concussions, are, relatively, common, as, are, pulmonary, contusions, in, which, the, force, of, impact, bruises, the, lungs, other, injuries, that, may, occur, include, torn, tricep, muscles, torn, acl, ligaments, and, lower, back, issues, when, entering, the, water, divers, spread, their, arms, and, somersault, either, forward, or, backward, underwater, the, illusion, of, a, vertical, entry, and, pull, extra, water, down, that, hole, with, them, in, a, maneuver, that, stresses, lower, back, muscles, and, hip, flexors, when, divers, performs, this, underwater, somersault, it, is, extremely, inadvisable, to, attempt, to, scoop, the, trajectory, underwater, against, the, rotation, as, it, can, cause, serious, back, injuries, injuries, that, diver, tom, daley, has, received, include, concussions, torn, triceps, broken, ribs, coughed, up, blood, tom, also, has, a, scar, on, the, top, of, his, head, from, hitting, his, head, on, the, diving, board, tom, has, also, described, the, deterioration, of, a, knee, injury, that, he, received, during, the, first, lockdown, in, 2020, i, d, torn, some, cartilage, in, my, knee, but, there, was, no, pain, and, i, continued, to, train, just, when, the, olympics, was, only, eight, weeks, away, my, knee, got, tighter, and, tighter, like, a, screw, being, turned, it, became, locked, in, a, position, and, i, couldn, t, straighten, it, or, bend, it, we, booked, a, scan, we, thought, maybe, it, just, needed, an, injection, to, get, it, moving, again, the, doctor, also, mooted, the, idea, that, it, might, need, keyhole, surgery, from, there, i, was, sent, for, an, mri, scan, from, the, scan, we, could, see, that, the, cartilage, had, not, only, torn, it, had, also, flipped, up, and, the, joint, had, come, back, down, on, top, of, it, it, can, be, flattened, and, sewn, back, down, but, the, surgeon, described, it, as, being, a, bit, like, a, bent, credit, card, that, may, snap, up, again, or, cause, more, problems, the, only, other, way, to, fix, the, problem, was, to, take, it, out, there, is, a, recovery, time, of, four, to, six, weeks, the, doctor, said, a, couple, of, weeks, after, surgery, i, was, back, in, the, pool, building, my, diving, back, up, again, in, 1983, at, the, world, university, games, in, edmonton, canada, diver, sergei, chalibashvili, aged, 21, died, when, he, was, attempting, a, reverse, 3, 1, 2, somersault, and, his, head, collided, with, the, hardwood, 10, metre, diving, platform, after, the, accident, he, was, taken, to, hospital, and, died, a, week, later, in, 1987, during, training, diver, nathan, meade, aged, 21, died, when, he, struck, his, head, on, a, 10, metre, concrete, platform, the, dive, he, was, attempting, was, a, reverse, 2, 1, 2, somersault, there, are, six, groups, into, which, dives, are, classified, forward, back, inward, reverse, twist, and, armstand, the, armstand, group, applies, only, to, platform, competitions, whereas, the, other, five, groups, apply, to, both, springboard, and, platform, during, the, flight, of, the, dive, one, of, four, positions, is, assumed, these, positions, are, referred, to, by, the, letters, a, b, c, and, d, respectively, additionally, some, dives, can, be, started, in, a, flying, position, the, body, is, kept, straight, with, the, arms, extended, to, the, side, and, the, regular, dive, position, is, assumed, at, about, half, the, dive, difficulty, is, rated, according, to, the, degree, of, difficulty, of, the, dives, some, divers, may, find, pike, easier, in, a, flip, than, tuck, and, most, find, straight, the, easiest, in, a, front, back, dive, although, it, is, still, rated, the, most, difficult, because, of, the, risk, of, overrotation, an, armstand, dive, may, have, a, higher, degree, of, difficulty, outdoors, compared, to, indoors, as, wind, can, destabilize, the, equilibrium, of, the, diver, in, competition, the, dives, are, referred, to, by, a, schematic, system, of, three, or, four, digit, numbers, the, letter, to, indicate, the, position, is, appended, to, the, end, of, the, number, the, first, digit, of, the, number, indicates, the, dive, group, as, defined, above, for, groups, 1, to, 4, the, number, consists, of, three, digits, and, a, letter, of, the, alphabet, the, third, digit, represents, the, number, of, half, somersaults, the, second, digit, is, either, 0, or, 1, with, 0, representing, a, normal, somersault, and, 1, signifying, a, flying, variation, of, the, basic, movement, i, e, the, first, half, somersault, is, performed, in, the, straight, position, and, then, the, pike, or, tuck, shape, is, assumed, no, flying, dive, has, been, competed, at, a, high, level, competition, for, many, years, for, example, for, group, 5, the, dive, number, has, 4, digits, the, first, digit, indicates, that, it, is, a, twisting, dive, the, second, digit, indicates, the, group, 1, 4, of, the, underlying, movement, the, third, digit, indicates, the, number, of, half, somersaults, and, the, fourth, indicates, the, number, of, half, twists, for, example, for, group, 6, armstand, the, dive, number, has, either, three, or, four, digits, three, digits, for, dives, without, twist, and, four, for, dives, with, twists, in, non, twisting, armstand, dives, the, second, digit, indicates, the, direction, of, rotation, 0, no, rotation, 1, forward, 2, backward, 3, reverse, 4, inward, and, the, third, digit, indicates, the, number, of, half, somersaults, inward, rotating, armstand, dives, have, never, been, performed, and, are, generally, regarded, as, physically, impossible, for, example, for, twisting, armstand, dives, the, dive, number, again, has, 4, digits, but, rather, than, beginning, with, the, number, 5, the, number, 6, remains, as, the, first, digit, indicating, that, the, twister, will, be, performed, from, an, armstand, the, second, digit, indicates, the, direction, of, rotation, as, above, the, third, is, the, number, of, half, somersaults, and, the, fourth, is, the, number, of, half, twists, e, g, 6243d, armstand, back, double, somersault, with, one, and, a, half, twists, in, the, free, position, all, of, these, dives, come, with, dd, degree, of, difficulty, this, is, an, indication, of, how, difficult, complex, a, dive, is, the, score, that, the, dive, receives, is, multiplied, by, the, dd, also, known, as, tariff, to, give, the, dive, a, final, score, before, a, diver, competes, they, must, decide, on, a, list, this, is, a, number, of, optional, dives, and, compulsory, dives, the, optionals, come, with, a, dd, limit, this, means, that, a, diver, must, select, x, number, of, dives, and, the, combined, dd, limit, must, be, no, more, than, the, limit, set, by, the, competition, organisation, etc, until, the, mid, 1990s, the, tariff, was, decided, by, the, fina, diving, committee, and, divers, could, only, select, from, the, range, of, dives, in, the, published, tariff, table, since, then, the, tariff, is, calculated, by, a, formula, based, on, various, factors, such, as, the, number, of, twist, and, somersaults, the, height, the, group, etc, and, divers, are, free, to, submit, new, combinations, this, change, was, implemented, because, new, dives, were, being, invented, too, frequently, for, an, annual, meeting, to, accommodate, the, progress, of, the, sport, at, the, moment, of, take, off, two, critical, aspects, of, the, dive, are, determined, and, cannot, subsequently, be, altered, during, the, execution, one, is, the, trajectory, of, the, dive, and, the, other, is, the, magnitude, of, the, angular, momentum, the, speed, of, rotation, and, therefore, the, total, amount, of, rotation, may, be, varied, from, moment, to, moment, by, changing, the, shape, of, the, body, in, accordance, with, the, law, of, conservation, of, angular, momentum, the, center, of, mass, of, the, diver, follows, a, parabolic, path, in, free, fall, under, the, influence, of, gravity, ignoring, the, effects, of, air, resistance, which, are, negligible, at, the, speeds, involved, since, the, parabola, is, symmetrical, the, travel, away, from, the, board, as, the, diver, passes, it, is, twice, the, amount, of, the, forward, travel, at, the, peak, of, the, flight, excessive, forward, distance, to, the, entry, point, is, penalized, when, scoring, a, dive, but, obviously, an, adequate, clearance, from, the, diving, board, is, essential, on, safety, grounds, the, greatest, possible, height, that, can, be, achieved, is, desirable, for, several, reasons, the, magnitude, of, angular, momentum, remains, constant, throughout, the, dive, but, since, and, the, moment, of, inertia, is, larger, when, the, body, has, an, increased, radius, the, speed, of, rotation, may, be, increased, by, moving, the, body, into, a, compact, shape, and, reduced, by, opening, out, into, a, straight, position, since, the, tucked, shape, is, the, most, compact, it, gives, the, most, control, over, rotational, speed, and, dives, in, this, position, are, easier, to, perform, dives, in, the, straight, position, are, hardest, since, there, is, almost, no, scope, for, altering, the, speed, so, the, angular, momentum, must, be, created, at, take, off, with, a, very, high, degree, of, accuracy, a, small, amount, of, control, is, available, by, moving, the, position, of, the, arms, and, by, a, slight, hollowing, of, the, back, the, opening, of, the, body, for, the, entry, does, not, stop, the, rotation, but, merely, slows, it, down, the, vertical, entry, achieved, by, expert, divers, is, largely, an, illusion, created, by, starting, the, entry, slightly, short, of, vertical, so, that, the, legs, are, vertical, as, they, disappear, beneath, the, surface, a, small, amount, of, additional, tuning, is, available, by, entry, save, techniques, whereby, underwater, movements, of, the, upper, body, and, arms, against, the, viscosity, of, the, water, affect, the, position, of, the, legs, dives, with, multiple, twists, and, somersaults, are, some, of, the, most, spectacular, movements, as, well, as, the, most, challenging, to, perform, the, rules, state, that, twisting, must, not, be, generated, manifestly, on, take, off, consequently, divers, must, use, some, of, the, somersaulting, angular, momentum, to, generate, twisting, movements, the, physics, of, twisting, can, be, explained, by, looking, at, the, components, of, the, angular, momentum, vector, as, the, diver, leaves, the, board, the, total, angular, momentum, vector, is, horizontal, pointing, directly, to, the, left, for, a, forward, dive, for, example, for, twisting, rotation, to, exist, it, is, necessary, to, tilt, the, body, sideways, after, takeoff, so, that, there, is, now, a, small, component, of, this, horizontal, angular, momentum, vector, along, the, body, s, long, axis, the, tilt, can, be, seen, in, the, photo, the, tilting, is, done, by, the, arms, which, are, outstretched, to, the, sides, just, before, the, twist, when, one, arm, is, moved, up, and, the, other, is, moved, down, like, turning, a, big, steering, wheel, the, body, reacts, by, tilting, to, the, side, which, then, begins, the, twisting, rotation, at, the, completion, of, the, required, number, of, twist, rotations, the, arm, motion, is, reversed, the, steering, wheel, is, turned, back, which, removes, the, body, s, tilt, and, stops, the, twisting, rotation, an, alternative, explanation, is, that, the, moving, arms, have, precession, torque, on, them, which, set, the, body, into, twisting, rotation, moving, the, arms, back, produces, opposite, torque, which, stops, the, twisting, rotation, the, rules, state, that, the, body, should, be, vertical, or, nearly, so, for, entry, strictly, speaking, it, is, physically, impossible, to, achieve, a, literally, vertical, position, throughout, the, entry, as, there, will, inevitably, still, be, some, rotational, momentum, while, the, body, is, entering, the, water, divers, therefore, attempt, to, create, the, illusion, of, being, vertical, especially, when, performing, rapidly, rotating, multiple, somersault, movements, for, back, entries, one, technique, is, to, allow, the, upper, body, to, enter, slightly, short, of, vertical, so, that, the, continuing, rotation, leaves, the, final, impression, of, the, legs, entering, vertically, this, is, called, knee, save, another, is, to, use, pike, save, movements, of, scooping, the, upper, body, underwater, in, the, direction, of, rotation, so, as, to, counteract, the, rotation, of, the, legs, knee, saves, are, performed, for, back, entries, and, pike, saves, are, performed, for, front, entries, the, arms, must, be, beside, the, body, for, feet, first, dives, which, are, typically, competed, only, on, the, 1m, springboard, and, only, at, fairly, low, levels, of, 3m, springboard, and, extended, forwards, in, line, for, head, first, dives, which, are, much, more, common, competitively, it, used, to, be, common, for, the, hands, to, be, interlocked, with, the, fingers, extended, towards, the, water, but, a, different, technique, has, become, favoured, during, the, last, few, decades, now, the, usual, practice, is, for, one, hand, to, grasp, the, other, with, palms, down, to, strike, the, water, with, a, flat, surface, this, creates, a, vacuum, between, the, hands, arms, and, head, which, with, a, vertical, entry, will, pull, down, and, under, any, splash, until, deep, enough, to, have, minimal, effect, on, the, surface, of, the, water, the, so, called, rip, entry, once, a, diver, is, completely, under, the, water, they, may, choose, to, roll, or, scoop, in, the, same, direction, their, dive, was, rotating, to, pull, their, legs, into, a, more, vertical, position, apart, from, aesthetic, considerations, it, is, important, from, a, safety, point, of, view, that, divers, reinforce, the, habit, of, rolling, in, the, direction, of, rotation, especially, for, forward, and, inward, entries, back, injuries, such, as, hyperextension, are, caused, by, attempting, to, re, surface, in, the, opposite, direction, diving, from, the, higher, levels, increases, the, danger, and, likelihood, of, such, injuries, in, canada, elite, competitive, diving, is, regulated, by, dpc, diving, plongeon, canada, although, the, individual, provinces, also, have, organizational, bodies, the, main, competitive, season, runs, from, february, to, july, although, some, competitions, may, be, held, in, january, or, december, and, many, divers, particularly, international, level, athletes, will, train, and, compete, year, round, most, provincial, level, competitions, consist, of, events, for, six, age, groups, groups, a, b, c, d, e, and, open, for, both, genders, on, each, of, the, three, board, levels, these, age, groups, roughly, correspond, to, those, standardized, by, fina, with, the, addition, of, a, youngest, age, group, for, divers, 9, and, younger, group, e, which, does, not, compete, nationally, and, does, not, have, a, tower, event, although, divers, of, this, age, may, choose, to, compete, in, group, d, the, age, group, open, is, so, called, because, divers, of, any, age, including, those, over, 18, may, compete, in, these, events, so, long, as, their, dives, meet, a, minimum, standard, of, difficulty, although, canada, is, internationally, a, fairly, strong, country, in, diving, the, vast, majority, of, canadian, high, schools, and, universities, do, not, have, diving, teams, and, many, canadian, divers, accept, athletic, scholarships, from, american, colleges, adult, divers, who, are, not, competitive, at, an, elite, level, may, compete, in, masters, diving, typically, masters, are, either, adults, who, never, practiced, the, sport, as, children, or, teenagers, or, former, elite, athletes, who, have, retired, but, still, seek, a, way, to, be, involved, in, the, sport, many, diving, clubs, have, masters, teams, in, addition, to, their, primary, competitive, ones, and, while, some, masters, dive, only, for, fun, and, fitness, there, are, also, masters, competitions, which, range, from, the, local, to, world, championship, level, divers, can, qualify, to, compete, at, the, age, group, national, championships, or, junior, national, championships, in, their, age, groups, as, assigned, by, fina, up, to, the, age, of, 18, this, competition, is, held, annually, in, july, qualification, is, based, on, achieving, minimum, scores, at, earlier, competitions, in, the, season, although, athletes, who, place, very, highly, at, a, national, championship, will, be, automatically, qualified, to, compete, at, the, next, divers, must, qualify, at, two, different, competitions, at, least, one, of, which, must, be, a, level, 1, competition, i, e, a, competition, with, fairly, strict, judging, patterns, such, competitions, include, the, polar, bear, invitational, in, winnipeg, the, sting, in, victoria, and, the, alberta, provincial, championships, in, edmonton, or, calgary, the, qualifying, scores, are, determined, by, dpc, according, to, the, results, of, the, preceding, year, s, national, competition, and, typically, do, not, have, much, variation, from, year, to, year, divers, older, than, 18, or, advanced, divers, of, younger, ages, can, qualify, for, the, senior, national, championships, which, are, held, twice, each, year, once, roughly, in, march, and, once, in, june, or, july, once, again, qualification, is, based, on, achieving, minimum, scores, at, earlier, competitions, in, this, case, within, the, 12, months, preceding, the, national, championships, and, in, an, open, age, group, event, or, high, placements, in, previous, national, championships, or, international, competitions, it, is, no, longer, the, case, that, divers, may, use, results, from, age, group, events, to, qualify, for, senior, nationals, or, results, from, open, events, to, qualify, for, age, group, nationals, in, the, republic, of, ireland, facilities, are, limited, to, one, operational, pool, at, the, national, aquatic,

compete, in, the, ncaa, separate, from, swim, team, events, ncaa, divisions, ii, and, iii, do, not, usually, compete, platform, if, a, diver, wishes, to, compete, platform, in, college, he, or, she, must, attend, a, division, i, school, each, division, also, has, rules, on, the, number, of, dives, in, each, competition, division, ii, schools, compete, with, 10, dives, in, competition, whereas, division, iii, schools, compete, with, 11, division, i, schools, only, compete, with, 6, dives, in, competition, these, 6, dives, consist, of, either, 5, optionals, and, 1, voluntary, or, 6, optionals, if, the, meet, is, a, 5, optional, meet, then, the, divers, will, perform, 1, optional, from, each, category, front, back, inward, reverse, and, twister, and, then, 1, voluntary, from, the, category, of, their, choice, the, voluntary, in, this, type, of, meet, is, always, worth, a, dd, degree, of, difficulty, of, 2, 0, even, if, the, real, dd, is, worth, more, or, less, on, a, dd, sheet, in, a, 6, optional, meet, the, divers, will, yet, again, perform, one, dive, from, each, category, but, this, time, they, will, perform, a, 6th, optional, from, the, category, of, their, choosing, which, is, worth, its, actual, dd, from, the, dd, sheet, the, highest, level, of, collegiate, competition, is, the, ncaa, division, 1, swimming, and, diving, championship, events, at, the,

are, combined, to, determine, a, team, swimming, diving, champion, to, qualify, for, a, diving, event, at, the, ncaa, championships, a, competitor, must, first, finish, in, the, top, three, at, one, of, five, zone, championships, which, are, held, after, the, various, conference, championship, meets, a, diver, who, scores, at, least, 310, points, on, the, 3, meter, springboard, and, 300, points, on, the, 1, meter, springboard, in, a, 6, optional, meet, can, participate, in, the, particular, zone, championship, corresponding, to, the, geographic, region, in, which, his, or, her, school, lies, a, number, of, colleges, and, universities, offer, scholarships, to, men, and, women, who, have, competitive, diving, skills, these, scholarships, are, usually, offered, to, divers, with, age, group, or, club, diving, experience, the, ncaa, limits, the, number, of, years, a, college, student, can, represent, any, school, in, competitions, the, limit, is, four, years, but, could, be, less, under, certain, circumstances, divers, who, continue, diving, past, their, college, years, can, compete, in, masters, diving, programs, masters, diving, programs, are, frequently, offered, by, college, or, club, programs, masters, diving, events, are, normally, conducted, in, age, groups, separated, by, five, or, ten, years, and, attract, competitors, of, a, wide, range, of, ages, and, experience, many, indeed, are, newcomers, to, the, sport, the, oldest, competitor, in, a, masters, diving, championship, was, viola, krahn, who, at, the, age, of, 101, was, the, first, person, in, any, sport, male, or, female, anywhere, in, the, world, to, compete, in, an, age, group, of, 100, years, in, a, nationally, organized, competition, diving, is, also, popular, as, a, non, competitive, activity, such, diving, usually, emphasizes, the, airborne, experience, and, the, height, of, the, dive, but, does, not, emphasize, what, goes, on, once, the, diver, enters, the, water, the, ability, to, dive, underwater, can, be, a, useful, emergency, skill, and, is, an, important, part, of, watersport, and, navy, safety, training, entering, water, from, a, height, is, an, enjoyable, leisure, activity, as, is, underwater, swimming, such, non, competitive, diving, can, occur, indoors, and, outdoors, outdoor, diving, typically, takes, place, from, cliffs, or, other, rock, formations, either, into, fresh, or, salt, water, however, man, made, diving, platforms, are, sometimes, constructed, in, popular, swimming, destinations, outdoor, diving, requires, knowledge, of, the, water, depth, and, currents, as, conditions, can, be, dangerous, on, occasion, the, diver, will, inadvertently, belly, flop, entering, the, water, horizontally, or, nearly, so, the, diver, typically, displaces, a, larger, than, usual, amount, of, water, a, recently, developing, section, of, the, sport, is, high, diving, e, g, see, 2013, world, aquatics, championships, conducted, in, open, air, locations, usually, from, improvised, platforms, up, to, 27, meters, 89, ft, high, as, compared, with, 10, meters, 33, ft, as, used, in, olympic, and, world, championship, events, entry, to, the, water, is, invariably, feet, first, to, avoid, the, risk, of, injury, that, would, be, involved, in, head, first, entry, from, that, height, the, final, half, somersault, is, almost, always, performed, backwards, enabling, the, diver, to, spot, the, entry, point, and, control, their, rotation, competitive, high, diving, is, run, as, the, red, bull, cliff, diving, world, series
