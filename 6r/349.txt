instead, of, producing, its, own, beginning, with, super, bowl, ii, nbc, televised, the, game, in, even, years, and, cbs, in, odd, years, this, annual, rotation, between, the, two, networks, continued, through, the, 1970, afl, nfl, merger, when, nbc, was, given, the, rights, to, televise, afc, games, and, cbs, winning, the, rights, to, broadcast, nfc, games, although, abc, began, broadcasting, monday, night, football, in, 1970, it, was, not, added, to, the, super, bowl, rotation, until, super, bowl, xix, played, in, 1985, abc, cbs, and, nbc, then, continued, to, rotate, the, super, bowl, until, 1994, when, fox, replaced, cbs, as, the, nfc, broadcaster, cbs, then, took, nbc, s, place, in, the, rotation, after, the, former, replaced, the, latter, as, the, afc, broadcaster, in, 1998, as, a, result, of, new, contracts, signed, in, 2006, with, nbc, taking, over, sunday, night, football, from, espn, and, monday, night, football, moving, from, abc, to, espn, nbc, took, abc,

bolster, other, major, sporting, events, a, network, airs, afterwards, for, example, cbs, was, given, super, bowl, xxvi, 1992, after, it, won, the, rights, to, air, the, 1992, winter, olympics, with, nbc, subsequently, airing, super, bowl, xxvii, 1993, and, super, bowl, xxviii, 1994, in, consecutive, years, likewise, nbc, aired, super, bowl, lvi, 2022, instead, of, cbs, during, the, 2022, winter,

the, only, person, to, broadcast, a, super, bowl, for, each, of, the, four, networks, that, have, televised, the, game, five, with, cbs, three, with, fox, two, with, abc, and, one, with, nbc, from, 2016, to, 2025, the, full, television, production, rights, of, the, game, were, owned, by, the, most, production, company, of, the, world, fly, on, the, wall, entertainment, note, years, listed, are, the, year, the, game, was, actually, played, will, be, played, rather, than, what, nfl, season, it, is, considered, to, have, been, the, current, tv, contract, with, the, networks, expires, after, the, 2033, season, or, in, early, 2034, under, the, deal, the, super, bowl, is, currently, rotated, annually, between, cbs, fox, nbc, and, abc, in, that, order, abc, will, return, to, the, rotation,

network, using, the, same, video, feed, from, cbs, but, providing, its, own, commentary, the, super, bowl, provides, an, extremely, strong, lead, in, to, programming, following, it, on, the, same, channel, the, effects, of, which, can, last, for, several, hours, for, instance, in, discussing, the, ratings, of, a, local, tv, station, buffalo, television, critic, alan, pergament, noted, that, following, super, bowl, xlvii, which, aired, on, cbs, a, paid, program, that, ran, on, cbs, 4, wivb, tv, at, 2, 30, in, the, morning, had, a, 1, 3, rating, that, s, higher, than, some, cw, prime, time, shows, get, on, wnlo, tv, channel, 4, s, sister, station, because, of, this, strong, coattail, effect, the, network, that, airs, the, super, bowl, typically, takes, advantage, of, the, large, audience, to, air, an, episode, of, a, hit, series, or, to, premiere, the, pilot, of, a, promising, new, one, in, the, lead, out, slot, which, immediately, follows, the, super, bowl, and, post, game, coverage, initially, it, was, sort, of, a, novelty, and, so, it, didn, t, quite, feel, right, but, it, was, just, like, this, is, the, year, bands, of, our, generation, you, can, sort, of, be, seen,

bands, from, local, colleges, or, high, schools, but, as, the, popularity, of, the, game, increased, a, trend, emerged, where, popular, singers, and, musicians, performed, during, its, pre, game, ceremonies, and, the, halftime, show, or, simply, sang, the, national, anthem, of, the, united, states, america, the, beautiful, or, lift, every, voice, and, sing, the, u, s, national, anthem, has,

if, the, stadium, in, which, the, super, bowl, was, held, was, perceived, to, be, a, better, stadium, for, a, large, high, profile, event, than, the, existing, nfl, home, stadium, in, the, same, city, for, example, five, of, los, angeles, s, bowls, were, played, at, the, rose, bowl, which, has, never, been, used, by, any, nfl, franchise, outside, of, the, super, bowl, besides, the, rose, bowl, the, only, other, super, bowl, venues, that, were, not, the, home, stadium, to, nfl, teams, at, the, time, were, rice, stadium, the, houston, oilers, had, played, in, rice, stadium, previously, but, moved, to, the, astrodome, several, years, before, super, bowl, viii, and, stanford, stadium, starting, with, the, selection, of, the, super, bowl, xxviii, venue, on, may, 23, 1990, the, league, has, given, preference, in, awarding, the, super, bowl, to, brand, new, or, recently, renovated, nfl, stadiums, alongside, a, trend, of, teams, demanding, public, money, or, relocating, to, play, in, new, stadiums, to, date, only, two, teams, have, qualified, for, a, super, bowl, at, their, home, stadiums, the, 2020, tampa, bay, buccaneers, who, won, super, bowl, lv, hosted, at, raymond, james, stadium, selected, on, may, 23, 2017, and, the, 2021, los, angeles, rams, the, following, season, who, won, super, bowl, lvi, at, sofi, stadium, before, that, the, closest, any, team, had, come, to, accomplishing, this, feat, were, the, 2017, minnesota, vikings, who, reached, the, nfc, championship, game, but, lost, to, the, eagles, in, that, instance, u, s, bank, stadium, became, the, first, super, bowl, host, stadium, selected, on, may, 20, 2014, to, also, host, a, divisional, playoff, game, in, the, same, season, which, the, vikings, won, all, previous, times, that, the, super, bowl, host, stadium, hosted, another, playoff, game, in, the, same, postseason, were, all, wild, card, games, two, teams, have, played, the, super, bowl, in, their, home, market, but, at, a, different, venue, than, their, home, stadium, the, los, angeles, rams, who, lost, super, bowl, xiv, in, the, rose, bowl, instead, of, los, angeles, memorial, coliseum, and, the, 49ers, who, won, super, bowl, xix, in, stanford, stadium, instead, of, candlestick, park, during, a, time, when, the, league, often, picked, a, stadium, that, was, not, home, to, an, nfl, team, to, host, the, super, bowl, see,

did, not, have, a, roof, be, it, fixed, or, retractable, but, it, was, still, picked, as, the, host, stadium, for, super, bowl, xlviii, in, an, apparent, waiver, of, the, warm, climate, rule, with, a, contingency, plan, to, reschedule, the, game, in, the, event, of, heavy, snowfall, metlife, stadium, s, selection, over, sun, life, stadium, generated, controversy, as, the, league, requested, a, roof, to, be, added, to, sun, life, stadium, a, venue, afflicted, with, a, heavy, rainstorm, during, super, bowl, xli, in, order, to, be, considered, for, future, super, bowls, which, was, done,

allowed, to, bid, for, the, rights, to, host, super, bowls, where, cities, submitted, proposals, to, host, a, super, bowl, and, were, evaluated, in, terms, of, stadium, renovation, and, their, ability, to, host, but, this, competition, was, rescinded, in, 2018, the, league, has, made, all, decisions, regarding, hosting, sites, from, super, bowl, lvii, onward, the, league, chose, a, potential, venue, unilaterally, the, chosen, team, put, together, a, hosting, proposal, and, the, league, voted, upon, it, to, determine, if, it, is, acceptable, in, 2014, a, document, listing, the, specific, requirements, of, super, bowl, hosts, was, leaked, giving, a, clear, list, of, what, was, required, for, a, super, bowl, host, some, of, the, host, requirements, include, much, of, the, cost, of, a, super, bowl, is, to, be, assumed, by, the, host, community, although, some, costs, are, enumerated, within, the, requirements, to, be, assumed, by, the, nfl, new, orleans, the, site, of,

which, resulted, in, the, cowboys, donning, their, less, exposed, dark, blue, jerseys, for, super, bowl, v, while, most, of, the, home, teams, in, the, super, bowl, have, chosen, to, wear, their, colored, jerseys, there, have, been, seven, exceptions, the, cowboys, during, super, bowls, xiii, and, xxvii, the, washington, redskins, during, super, bowl, xvii, the, steelers, during, super, bowl,
