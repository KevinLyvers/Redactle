a, soft, drink, see, terminology, for, other, names, is, any, water, based, flavored, drink, usually, but, not, necessarily, carbonated, and, typically, including, added, sweetener, flavors, used, can, be, natural, or, artificial, the, sweetener, may, be, a, sugar, high, fructose, corn, syrup, fruit, juice, a, sugar, substitute, in, the, case, of, diet, sodas, or, some, combination, of, these, soft, drinks, may, also, contain, caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and, other, ingredients, soft, drinks, are, called, soft, in, contrast, with, hard, alcoholic, drinks, small, amounts, of, alcohol, may, be, present, in, a, soft, drink, but, the, alcohol, content, must, be, less, than, 0, 5, of, the, total, volume, of, the, drink, in, many, countries, and, localities, if, the, drink, is, to, be, considered, non, alcoholic, types, of, soft, drinks, include, lemon, lime, drinks, orange, soda, cola, grape, soda, cream, soda, ginger, ale, and, root, beer, soft, drinks, may, be, served, cold, over, ice, cubes, or, at, room, temperature, they, are, available, in, many, container, formats, including, cans, glass, bottles, and, plastic, bottles, containers, come, in, a, variety, of, sizes, ranging, from, small, bottles, to, large, multi, liter, containers, soft, drinks, are, widely, available, at, fast, food, restaurants, movie, theaters, convenience, stores, casual, dining, restaurants, dedicated, soda, stores, vending, machines, and, bars, from, soda, fountain, machines, within, a, decade, of, the, invention, of, carbonated, water, by, joseph, priestley, in, 1767, inventors, in, europe, had, used, his, concept, to, produce, the, drink, in, greater, quantities, one, such, inventor, j, j, schweppe, formed, schweppes, in, 1783, and, began, selling, the, world, s, first, bottled, soft, drink, soft, drink, brands, founded, in, the, 19th, century, include, r, white, s, lemonade, in, 1845, dr, pepper, in, 1885, and, coca, cola, in, 1886, subsequent, brands, include, pepsi, irn, bru, sprite, fanta, 7, up, and, rc, cola, the, term, soft, drink, is, a, category, in, the, beverage, industry, and, is, broadly, used, in, product, labeling, and, on, restaurant, menus, generally, a, euphemistic, term, meaning, non, alcoholic, however, in, many, countries, such, drinks, are, more, commonly, referred, to, by, regional, names, including, pop, cool, drink, fizzy, drink, cola, soda, or, soda, pop, other, lesser, used, terms, include, carbonated, drink, fizzy, juice, lolly, water, seltzer, coke, tonic, and, mineral, due, to, the, high, sugar, content, in, typical, soft, drinks, they, may, also, be, called, sugary, drinks, in, the, united, states, the, 2003, harvard, dialect, survey, tracked, the, usage, of, the, nine, most, common, names, over, half, of, the, survey, respondents, preferred, the, term, soda, which, was, dominant, in, the, northeastern, united, states, california, and, the, areas, surrounding, milwaukee, and, st, louis, the, term, pop, which, was, preferred, by, 25, of, the, respondents, was, most, popular, in, the, midwest, and, pacific, northwest, while, the, genericized, trademark, coke, used, by, 12, of, the, respondents, was, most, popular, in, the, southern, united, states, the, term, tonic, is, distinctive, to, eastern, massachusetts, although, usage, is, declining, in, the, english, speaking, parts, of, canada, the, term, pop, is, prevalent, but, soft, drink, is, the, most, common, english, term, used, in, montreal, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, the, term, fizzy, drink, is, common, pop, and, fizzy, pop, are, used, in, northern, england, south, wales, and, the, midlands, while, mineral, is, used, in, ireland, in, scotland, fizzy, juice, or, even, simply, juice, is, colloquially, encountered, as, is, ginger, in, australia, and, new, zealand, soft, drink, or, fizzy, drink, is, typically, used, in, south, african, english, cool, drink, is, any, soft, drink, in, other, languages, various, names, are, used, descriptive, names, as, non, alcoholic, beverages, equivalents, of, soda, water, or, generalized, prototypical, names, for, example, the, bohemian, variant, of, the, czech, language, but, not, moravian, dialects, uses, limon, da, for, all, such, beverages, not, only, for, those, from, lemons, similarly, the, slovak, language, uses, malinovka, raspberry, water, for, all, such, beverages, not, only, for, raspberry, ones, the, origins, of, soft, drinks, lie, in, the, development, of, fruit, flavored, drinks, in, the, medieval, middle, east, a, variety, of, fruit, flavored, soft, drinks, were, widely, drunk, such, as, sharbat, and, were, often, sweetened, with, ingredients, such, as, sugar, syrup, and, honey, other, common, ingredients, included, lemon, apple, pomegranate, tamarind, jujube, sumac, musk, mint, and, ice, middle, eastern, drinks, later, became, popular, in, medieval, europe, where, the, word, syrup, was, derived, from, arabic, in, tudor, england, water, imperial, was, widely, drunk, it, was, a, sweetened, drink, with, lemon, flavor, and, containing, cream, of, tartar, manays, cryste, was, a, sweetened, cordial, flavored, with, rosewater, violets, or, cinnamon, another, early, type, of, soft, drink, was, lemonade, made, of, water, and, lemon, juice, sweetened, with, honey, but, without, carbonated, water, the, compagnie, des, limonadiers, of, paris, was, granted, a, monopoly, for, the, sale, of, lemonade, soft, drinks, in, 1676, vendors, carried, tanks, of, lemonade, on, their, backs, and, dispensed, cups, of, the, soft, drink, to, parisians, carbonated, drinks, or, fizzy, drinks, are, beverages, that, consist, mainly, of, carbonated, water, the, dissolution, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, in, a, liquid, gives, rise, to, effervescence, or, fizz, carbon, dioxide, is, only, weakly, soluble, in, water, therefore, it, separates, into, a, gas, when, the, pressure, is, released, the, process, usually, involves, injecting, carbon, dioxide, under, high, pressure, when, the, pressure, is, removed, the, carbon, dioxide, is, released, from, the, solution, as, small, bubbles, which, causes, the, solution, to, become, effervescent, or, fizzy, carbonated, beverages, are, prepared, by, mixing, flavored, syrup, with, carbonated, water, carbonation, levels, range, up, to, 5, volumes, of, co, 2, per, liquid, volume, ginger, ale, colas, and, related, drinks, are, carbonated, with, 3, 5, volumes, other, drinks, often, fruity, ones, are, carbonated, less, in, the, late, 18th, century, scientists, made, important, progress, in, replicating, naturally, carbonated, mineral, waters, in, 1767, englishman, joseph, priestley, first, discovered, a, method, of, infusing, water, with, carbon, dioxide, to, make, carbonated, water, when, he, suspended, a, bowl, of, distilled, water, above, a, beer, vat, at, a, local, brewery, in, leeds, england, his, invention, of, carbonated, water, later, known, as, soda, water, for, the, use, of, soda, powders, in, its, commercial, manufacture, is, the, major, and, defining, component, of, most, soft, drinks, priestley, found, that, water, treated, in, this, manner, had, a, pleasant, taste, and, he, offered, it, to, his, friends, as, a, refreshing, drink, in, 1772, priestley, published, a, paper, entitled, impregnating, water, with, fixed, air, in, which, he, describes, dripping, oil, of, vitriol, or, sulfuric, acid, as, it, is, now, called, onto, chalk, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, gas, and, encouraging, the, gas, to, dissolve, into, an, agitated, bowl, of, water, within, a, decade, inventors, in, britain, and, in, europe, had, taken, priestley, s, basic, idea, get, some, fixed, air, mix, it, with, water, shake, and, created, contraptions, that, could, make, carbonated, water, more, quickly, in, greater, quantities, one, of, those, inventors, was, named, johann, jacob, schweppe, who, sold, bottled, soda, water, and, whose, business, is, still, around, today, the, great, soda, water, shake, up, october, 2014, the, atlantic, another, englishman, john, mervin, nooth, improved, priestley, s, design, and, sold, his, apparatus, for, commercial, use, in, pharmacies, swedish, chemist, torbern, bergman, invented, a, generating, apparatus, that, made, carbonated, water, from, chalk, by, the, use, of, sulfuric, acid, bergman, s, apparatus, allowed, imitation, mineral, water, to, be, produced, in, large, amounts, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, started, to, add, flavors, spices, juices, and, wine, to, carbonated, water, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, thomas, henry, an, apothecary, from, manchester, was, the, first, to, sell, artificial, mineral, water, to, the, general, public, for, medicinal, purposes, beginning, in, the, 1770s, his, recipe, for, bewley, s, mephitic, julep, consisted, of, 3, drachms, of, fossil, alkali, to, a, quart, of, water, and, the, manufacture, had, to, throw, in, streams, of, fixed, air, until, all, the, alkaline, taste, is, destroyed, johann, jacob, schweppe, developed, a, process, to, manufacture, bottled, carbonated, mineral, water, he, founded, the, schweppes, company, in, geneva, in, 1783, to, sell, carbonated, water, and, relocated, his, business, to, london, in, 1792, his, drink, soon, gained, in, popularity, among, his, newfound, patrons, was, erasmus, darwin, in, 1843, the, schweppes, company, commercialized, malvern, water, at, the, holywell, spring, in, the, malvern, hills, and, received, a, royal, warrant, from, king, william, iv, it, was, not, long, before, flavoring, was, combined, with, carbonated, water, the, earliest, reference, to, carbonated, ginger, beer, is, in, a, practical, treatise, on, brewing, published, in, 1809, the, drinking, of, either, natural, or, artificial, mineral, water, was, considered, at, the, time, to, be, a, healthy, practice, and, was, promoted, by, advocates, of, temperance, pharmacists, selling, mineral, waters, began, to, add, herbs, and, chemicals, to, unflavored, mineral, water, they, used, birch, bark, see, birch, beer, dandelion, sarsaparilla, root, fruit, extracts, and, other, substances, a, variant, of, soda, in, the, united, states, called, phosphate, soda, appeared, in, the, late, 1870s, it, became, one, of, the, most, popular, soda, fountain, drinks, from, 1900, through, the, 1930s, with, the, lemon, or, orange, phosphate, being, the, most, basic, the, drink, consists, of, 1, us, fl, oz, 30, ml, fruit, syrup, 1, 2, teaspoon, of, phosphoric, acid, and, enough, carbonated, water, and, ice, to, fill, a, glass, this, drink, was, commonly, served, in, pharmacies, soft, drinks, soon, outgrew, their, origins, in, the, medical, world, and, became, a, widely, consumed, product, available, cheaply, for, the, masses, by, the, 1840s, there, were, more, than, fifty, soft, drink, manufacturers, in, london, an, increase, from, just, ten, in, the, 1820s, carbonated, lemonade, was, widely, available, in, british, refreshment, stalls, in, 1833, and, in, 1845, r, white, s, lemonade, went, on, sale, in, the, uk, for, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, held, at, hyde, park, in, london, schweppes, was, designated, the, official, drink, supplier, and, sold, over, a, million, bottles, of, lemonade, ginger, beer, seltzer, water, and, soda, water, there, was, a, schweppes, soda, water, fountain, situated, directly, at, the, entrance, to, the, exhibition, mixer, drinks, became, popular, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, tonic, water, was, originally, quinine, added, to, water, as, a, prophylactic, against, malaria, and, was, consumed, by, british, officials, stationed, in, the, tropical, areas, of, south, asia, and, africa, as, the, quinine, powder, was, so, bitter, people, began, mixing, the, powder, with, soda, and, sugar, and, a, basic, tonic, water, was, created, the, first, commercial, tonic, water, was, produced, in, 1858, the, mixed, drink, gin, and, tonic, also, originated, in, british, colonial, india, when, the, british, population, would, mix, their, medicinal, quinine, tonic, with, gin, a, persistent, problem, in, the, soft, drinks, industry, was, the, lack, of, an, effective, sealing, of, the, bottles, carbonated, drink, bottles, are, under, great, pressure, from, the, gas, so, inventors, tried, to, find, the, best, way, to, prevent, the, carbon, dioxide, or, bubbles, from, escaping, the, bottles, could, also, explode, if, the, pressure, was, too, great, hiram, codd, devised, a, patented, bottling, machine, while, working, at, a, small, mineral, water, works, in, the, caledonian, road, islington, in, london, in, 1870, his, codd, neck, bottle, was, designed, to, enclose, a, marble, and, a, rubber, washer, in, the, neck, the, bottles, were, filled, upside, down, and, pressure, of, the, gas, in, the, bottle, forced, the, marble, against, the, washer, sealing, in, the, carbonation, the, bottle, was, pinched, into, a, special, shape, to, provide, a, chamber, into, which, the, marble, was, pushed, to, open, the, bottle, this, prevented, the, marble, from, blocking, the, neck, as, the, drink, was, poured, r, white, s, by, now, the, biggest, soft, drinks, company, in, london, and, south, east, england, featured, a, wide, range, of, drinks, on, their, price, list, in, 1887, all, of, which, were, sold, in, codd, s, glass, bottles, with, choices, including, strawberry, soda, raspberry, soda, cherryade, and, cream, soda, in, 1892, the, crown, cork, bottle, seal, was, patented, by, william, painter, a, baltimore, maryland, machine, shop, operator, it, was, the, first, bottle, top, to, successfully, keep, the, bubbles, in, the, bottle, in, 1899, the, first, patent, was, issued, for, a, glass, blowing, machine, for, the, automatic, production, of, glass, bottles, earlier, glass, bottles, had, all, been, hand, blown, four, years, later, the, new, bottle, blowing, machine, was, in, operation, it, was, first, operated, by, michael, owens, an, employee, of, libby, glass, company, within, a, few, years, glass, bottle, production, increased, from, 1, 400, bottles, a, day, to, about, 58, 000, bottles, a, day, in, america, soda, fountains, were, initially, more, popular, and, many, americans, would, frequent, the, soda, fountain, daily, beginning, in, 1806, yale, university, chemistry, professor, benjamin, silliman, sold, soda, waters, in, new, haven, connecticut, he, used, a, nooth, apparatus, to, produce, his, waters, businessmen, in, philadelphia, and, new, york, city, also, began, selling, soda, water, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, 1830s, john, matthews, of, new, york, city, and, john, lippincott, of, philadelphia, began, manufacturing, soda, fountains, both, men, were, successful, and, built, large, factories, for, fabricating, fountains, due, to, problems, in, the, u, s, glass, industry, bottled, drinks, remained, a, small, portion, of, the, market, throughout, much, of, the, 19th, century, however, they, were, known, in, england, in, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, published, in, 1848, the, caddish, huntingdon, recovering, from, months, of, debauchery, wakes, at, noon, and, gulps, a, bottle, of, soda, water, in, the, early, 20th, century, sales, of, bottled, soda, increased, greatly, around, the, world, and, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, canned, soft, drinks, became, an, important, share, of, the, market, during, the, 1920s, home, paks, were, invented, home, paks, are, the, familiar, six, pack, cartons, made, from, cardboard, vending, machines, also, began, to, appear, in, the, 1920s, since, then, soft, drink, vending, machines, have, become, increasingly, popular, both, hot, and, cold, drinks, are, sold, in, these, self, service, machines, throughout, the, world, per, capita, consumption, of, soda, varies, considerably, around, the, world, as, of, 2014, the, top, consuming, countries, per, capita, were, argentina, the, united, states, chile, and, mexico, developed, countries, in, europe, and, elsewhere, in, the, americas, had, considerably, lower, consumption, annual, average, consumption, in, the, united, states, at, 153, 5, liters, was, about, twice, that, in, the, united, kingdom, 77, 7, or, canada, 85, 3, in, recent, years, soda, consumption, has, generally, declined, in, the, west, according, to, one, estimate, per, capita, consumption, in, the, united, states, reached, its, peak, in, 1998, and, has, continually, fallen, since, a, study, in, the, journal, obesity, found, that, from, 2003, to, 2014, the, proportion, of, americans, who, drank, a, sugary, beverage, on, a, given, day, fell, from, approximately, 62, to, 50, for, adults, and, from, 80, to, 61, for, children, the, decrease, has, been, attributed, to, among, other, factors, an, increased, awareness, of, the, dangers, of, obesity, and, government, efforts, to, improve, diets, at, the, same, time, soda, consumption, has, increased, in, some, low, or, middle, income, countries, such, as, cameroon, georgia, india, and, vietnam, as, soda, manufacturers, increasingly, target, these, markets, and, consumers, have, increasing, discretionary, income, soft, drinks, are, made, by, mixing, dry, or, fresh, ingredients, with, water, production, of, soft, drinks, can, be, done, at, factories, or, at, home, soft, drinks, can, be, made, at, home, by, mixing, a, syrup, or, dry, ingredients, with, carbonated, water, or, by, lacto, fermentation, syrups, are, commercially, sold, by, companies, such, as, soda, club, dry, ingredients, are, often, sold, in, pouches, in, a, style, of, the, popular, u, s, drink, mix, kool, aid, carbonated, water, is, made, using, a, soda, siphon, or, a, home, carbonation, system, or, by, dropping, dry, ice, into, water, food, grade, carbon, dioxide, used, for, carbonating, drinks, often, comes, from, ammonia, plants, drinks, like, ginger, ale, and, root, beer, are, often, brewed, using, yeast, to, cause, carbonation, of, most, importance, is, that, the, ingredient, meets, the, agreed, specification, on, all, major, parameters, this, is, not, only, the, functional, parameter, in, other, words, the, level, of, the, major, constituent, but, the, level, of, impurities, the, microbiological, status, and, physical, parameters, such, as, color, particle, size, etc, some, soft, drinks, contain, measurable, amounts, of, alcohol, in, some, older, preparations, this, resulted, from, natural, fermentation, used, to, build, the, carbonation, in, the, united, states, soft, drinks, as, well, as, other, products, such, as, non, alcoholic, beer, are, allowed, by, law, to, contain, up, to, 0, 5, alcohol, by, volume, modern, drinks, introduce, carbon, dioxide, for, carbonation, but, there, is, some, speculation, that, alcohol, might, result, from, fermentation, of, sugars, in, a, non, sterile, environment, a, small, amount, of, alcohol, is, introduced, in, some, soft, drinks, where, alcohol, is, used, in, the, preparation, of, the, flavoring, extracts, such, as, vanilla, extract, market, control, of, the, soft, drink, industry, varies, on, a, country, by, country, basis, however, pepsico, and, the, coca, cola, company, remain, the, two, largest, producers, of, soft, drinks, in, most, regions, of, the, world, in, north, america, keurig, dr, pepper, and, jones, soda, also, hold, a, significant, amount, of, market, share, the, over, consumption, of, sugar, sweetened, soft, drinks, is, associated, with, obesity, hypertension, type, 2, diabetes, dental, caries, and, low, nutrient, levels, a, few, experimental, studies, reported, the, role, sugar, sweetened, soft, drinks, potentially, contribute, to, these, ailments, though, other, studies, show, conflicting, information, according, to, a, 2013, systematic, review, of, systematic, reviews, 83, 3, of, the, systematic, reviews, without, reported, conflict, of, interest, concluded, that, sugar, sweetened, soft, drinks, consumption, could, be, a, potential, risk, factor, for, weight, gain, from, 1977, to, 2002, americans, doubled, their, consumption, of, sweetened, beverages, a, trend, that, was, paralleled, by, doubling, the, prevalence, of, obesity, the, consumption, of, sugar, sweetened, beverages, is, associated, with, weight, and, obesity, and, changes, in, consumption, can, help, predict, changes, in, weight, the, consumption, of, sugar, sweetened, soft, drinks, can, also, be, associated, with, many, weight, related, diseases, including, diabetes, metabolic, syndrome, and, cardiovascular, risk, factors, most, soft, drinks, contain, high, concentrations, of, simple, carbohydrates, glucose, fructose, sucrose, and, other, simple, sugars, if, oral, bacteria, ferment, carbohydrates, and, produce, acids, that, may, dissolve, tooth, enamel, and, induce, dental, decay, then, sweetened, drinks, may, increase, the, risk, of, dental, caries, the, risk, would, be, greater, if, the, frequency, of, consumption, is, high, a, large, number, of, soda, pops, are, acidic, as, are, many, fruits, sauces, and, other, foods, drinking, acidic, drinks, over, a, long, period, and, continuous, sipping, may, erode, the, tooth, enamel, a, 2007, study, determined, that, some, flavored, sparkling, waters, are, as, erosive, or, more, so, than, orange, juice, using, a, drinking, straw, is, often, advised, by, dentists, as, the, drink, does, not, come, into, as, much, contact, with, the, teeth, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, brushing, teeth, right, after, drinking, soft, drinks, should, be, avoided, as, this, can, result, in, additional, erosion, to, the, teeth, due, to, mechanical, action, of, the, toothbrush, on, weakened, enamel, a, 2006, study, of, several, thousand, men, and, women, found, that, women, who, regularly, drank, cola, based, sodas, three, or, more, a, day, had, significantly, lower, bone, mineral, density, bmd, of, about, 4, in, the, hip, compared, to, women, who, did, not, consume, colas, the, study, found, that, the, effect, of, regular, consumption, of, cola, sodas, was, not, significant, on, men, s, bmd, in, 2006, the, united, kingdom, food, standards, agency, published, the, results, of, its, survey, of, benzene, levels, in, soft, drinks, which, tested, 150, products, and, found, that, four, contained, benzene, levels, above, the, world, health, organization, who, guidelines, for, drinking, water, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, released, its, own, test, results, of, several, soft, drinks, containing, benzoates, and, ascorbic, or, erythorbic, acid, five, tested, drinks, contained, benzene, levels, above, the, environmental, protection, agency, s, recommended, standard, of, 5, ppb, as, of, 2006, the, fda, stated, its, belief, that, the, levels, of, benzene, found, in, soft, drinks, and, other, beverages, to, date, do, not, pose, a, safety, concern, for, consumers, a, study, published, in, the, clinical, journal, of, the, american, society, of, nephrology, in, 2013, concluded, that, consumption, of, soft, drinks, was, associated, with, a, 23, higher, risk, of, developing, kidney, stones, in, a, 2019, study, of, 451, 743, europeans, those, who, had, a, consumption, of, soft, drinks, of, two, or, more, a, day, had, a, greater, chance, of, all, cause, mortality, than, those, who, drank, less, than, one, per, month, people, who, drank, artificially, sweetened, drinks, had, a, higher, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, and, people, who, drank, sugar, sweetened, drinks, with, digestive, diseases, since, at, least, 2006, debate, on, whether, high, calorie, soft, drink, vending, machines, should, be, allowed, in, schools, has, been, on, the, rise, opponents, of, the, soft, drink, vending, machines, believe, that, soft, drinks, are, a, significant, contributor, to, childhood, obesity, and, tooth, decay, and, that, allowing, soft, drink, sales, in, schools, encourages, children, to, believe, they, are, safe, to, consume, in, moderate, to, large, quantities, opponents, also, argue, that, schools, have, a, responsibility, to, look, after, the, health, of, the, children, in, their, care, and, that, allowing, children, easy, access, to, soft, drinks, violates, that, responsibility, vending, machine, proponents, believe, that, obesity, is, a, complex, issue, and, soft, drinks, are, not, the, only, cause, a, 2011, bill, to, tax, soft, drinks, in, california, failed, with, some, opposing, lawmakers, arguing, that, parents, not, the, government, should, be, responsible, for, children, s, drink, choices, on, may, 3, 2006, the, alliance, for, a, healthier, generation, cadbury, schweppes, the, coca, cola, company, pepsico, and, the, american, beverage, association, announced, new, guidelines, that, will, voluntarily, remove, high, calorie, soft, drinks, from, all, u, s, schools, on, may, 19, 2006, the, british, education, secretary, alan, johnson, announced, new, minimum, nutrition, standards, for, school, food, among, a, wide, range, of, measures, from, september, 2006, school, lunches, will, be, free, from, carbonated, drinks, schools, will, also, end, the, sale, of, junk, food, including, carbonated, drinks, in, vending, machines, and, tuck, shops, in, 2008, samantha, k, graff, published, an, article, in, the, annals, of, the, american, academy, of, political, and, social, science, regarding, the, first, amendment, implications, of, restricting, food, and, beverages, marketing, in, schools, the, article, examines, a,
