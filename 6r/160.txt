the, family, law, act, 1975, cth, a, stepparent, in, relation, to, a, child, is, interpreted, as, a, person, who, is, not, a, parent, of, the, child, and, is, or, has, been, married, to, or, a, de, facto, partner, of, a, parent, of, the, child, and, treats, or, at, any, time, while, married, to, or, a, de, facto, partner, of, the, parent, treated, the, child, as, a, member, of, the, family, formed, with, the, parent, if, one, member, of, the, couple, has, prior, children, but, the, couple, have, another, child, together, the, complex, blended, designation, replaces, the, simple, designation, upon, the, birth, of, the, new, child, any, subsequent, child, born, to, the, couple, is, a, half, sibling, of, the, respective, members, prior, children, other, types, of, stepfamilies, include, neotraditional, where, both, parents, share, the, responsibility, of, their, children, a, matriarchal, stepfamily, where, an, independent, woman, is, in, charge, of, the, family, with, the, stepfather, becoming, a, mentor, and, a, romantic, stepfamily, where, both, parents, expect, the, combining, of, their, separate, families, to, run, smoothly, without, realizing, any, possible, issues, according, to, james, bray, three, of, the, challenges, facing, a, stepfamily, are, financial, and, living, arrangements, resolving, feelings, about, the, previous, marriage, and, anticipating, parenting, changes, research, has, shown, that, parents, who, are, constantly, fighting, with, their, ex, spouse, tend, to, make, their, children, suffer, mentally, and, emotionally, however, parents, who, are, close, with, their, ex, spouse, tend, to, make, their, new, spouse, insecure, and, anxious, additional, challenges, that, a, step, or, blended, family, face, are, those, regarding, the, inherent, bond, that, biological, parents, have, with, their, children, and, vice, versa, stepparents, often, face, significant, difficulties, when, interacting, with, the, biological, parent, of, their, gender, often, biological, parents, feel, as, though, the, stepfather, or, stepmother, will, ultimately, replace, them, in, the, mind, s, of, the, child, ren, this, is, a, common, feeling, for, a, parent, when, faced, with, the, new, circumstance, of, blended, families, although, historically, stepfamilies, are, built, through, the, institution, of, marriage, and, are, legally, recognized, it, is, currently, unclear, if, a, stepfamily, can, be, both, established, and, recognized, by, less, formal, arrangements, such, as, when, a, man, or, woman, with, children, cohabits, with, another, man, or, woman, outside, of, marriage, this, relationship, is, becoming, more, common, in, all, western, countries, there, appear, to, be, many, cultures, in, which, these, families, are, recognized, socially, as, de, facto, families, however, in, modern, western, culture, it, is, often, unclear, as, to, what, if, any, social, status, and, protection, they, enjoy, in, law, the, stepparent, is, a, legal, stranger, in, most, of, the, u, s, and, has, no, legal, right, to, the, minor, child, no, matter, how, involved, in, the, child, s, life, they, are, the, biological, parents, and, where, applicable, adoptive, parents, hold, that, privilege, and, responsibility, if, the, biological, parent, does, not, give, up, their, parental, rights, and, custody, of, the, child, the, other, parent, s, subsequent, marriage, cannot, create, a, parental, relationship, without, the, biological, parent, s, written, consent, before, a, child, reaches, adulthood, in, most, cases, the, stepparent, can, not, be, ordered, to, pay, child, support, stepparents, generally, do, not, have, the, authority, to, give, legal, consent, to, medical, treatment, for, a, stepchild, unless, the, stepparent, has, legally, adopted, the, child, or, been, designated, a, legal, guardian, a, child, s, parents, or, legal, guardians, may, sign, a, statement, authorizing, a, third, party, to, consent, to, medical, care, if, a, stepparent, legally, adopts, the, partner, s, child, or, children, he, or, she, becomes, the, child, s, legal, parent, in, such, cases, the, parents, may, stop, using, the, terms, stepparent, and, stepchild, and, instead, refer, to, the, child, simply, as, their, son, or, daughter, depending, on, the, child, s, degree, of, affinity, for, the, adoptive, parent, and, or, approval, of, the, legal, proceedings, culminating, in, the, child, s, adoption, the, child, may, likewise, drop, the, step, designation, from, his, or, her, description, of, the, relationship, even, when, all, parties, describe, the, relationship, using, the, terms, applied, to, biological, and, adoptive, families, however, at, least, some, of, the, emotional, and, psychological, issues, common, to, stepfamilies, may, or, may, not, persist, thus, one, possibility, is, that, a, stepfamily, can, be, reconfigured, and, thanks, to, the, biological, and, adoptive, links, could, leave, the, condition, of, a, stepfamily, in, the, united, states, the, most, common, form, of, adoption, is, adopting, a, stepchild, by, adopting, a, stepchild, the, stepparent, is, agreeing, to, be, fully, responsible, for, their, spouse, s, child, the, non, custodial, parent, no, longer, has, any, rights, or, responsibilities, for, the, child, including, child, support, when, a, stepparent, adopts, a, stepchild, either, the, other, biological, parent, willingly, gives, up, their, parental, rights, to, the, child, the, court, terminates, those, rights, or, the, other, biological, parent, is, deceased, reasons, a, court, may, terminate, the, non, custodial, parent, s, rights, include, evidence, of, abuse, or, neglect, legal, abandonment, or, any, other, indications, that, a, continued, relationship, between, the, child, and, that, parent, would, be, detrimental, to, the, child, grounds, for, legal, child, abandonment, in, most, states, is, no, contact, between, the, parent, and, child, for, at, least, one, year, in, canada, one, needs, to, put, into, writing, what, the, child, s, circumstances, are, for, being, adopted, some, circumstances, may, include, the, child, s, mental, physical, and, emotional, welfare, their, background, religion, having, a, positive, relationship, etc, if, the, child, is, an, indigenous, person, then, the, family, must, specify, their, plan, to, keep, the, child, involved, in, their, culture, a, common, villain, of, classic, fairy, tales, is, the, abusive, stepmother, like, the, queen, in, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, lady, tremaine, in, cinderella, or, madame, fichini, in, the, trouble, with, sophie, which, shows, mother, in, law, as, cruel, she, mistreats, her, non, biological, child, by, locking, them, away, or, trying, to, kill, them, in, some, cases, and, treats, her, own, children, if, any, very, well, in, popular, culture, phrases, like, i, ll, beat, you, like, a, red, headed, stepchild, are, uttered, as, a, common, threat, that, show, just, how, aware, people, are, about, the, assumed, nature, of, stepfamily, abuse, the, thought, is, that, the, nonbiological, child, is, more, likely, to, be, beaten, because, of, the, lack, of, kinship, ties, the, research, on, this, topic, shows, that, this, issue, is, not, so, clearly, defined, the, image, of, the, wicked, stepmother, is, well, known, but, much, of, the, research, available, shows, more, of, the, abuse, coming, from, stepfathers, however, in, children, s, stories, it, is, rare, to, find, a, bad, father, in, law, yet, there, are, several, such, as, charles, francis, mistrane, a, bad, father, in, law, violent, and, hateful, in, the, eleonore, tale, by, r, j, p, toreille, published, in, france, in, 2018, stepfathers, have, been, shown, to, abuse, female, stepchildren, more, than, males, they, are, also, shown, to, be, more, abusive, towards, female, children, than, biological, families, but, less, abusive, than, adoptive, fathers, the, abuse, studied, with, men, in, mind, tends, to, focus, on, physical, or, sexual, abuse, of, children, rather, than, emotional, abuse, neglect, is, also, discussed, as, a, qualifying, method, of, child, abuse, by, stepparents, in, general, in, 2004, a, u, s, study, by, weekes, and, weekes, shackelford, found, that, while, biological, fathers, fatally, abuse, children, five, and, under, at, a, rate, of, 5, 6, per, million, per, year, stepfathers, were, found, to, have, a, rate, of, 55, 9, per, million, per, year, a, u, k, study, done, in, 2000, had, different, results, which, found, that, many, fewer, children, responded, as, being, abused, by, a, stepparent, economic, factors, could, also, play, a, role, in, the, abuse, of, stepchildren, in, places, with, higher, levels, of, social, strain, abuse, may, be, more, prevalent, or, more, violent, other, studies, of, census, data, and, child, neglect, and, abuse, records, have, found, that, stepparents, may, be, over, represented, in, abuse, figures, they, have, found, that, when, the, data, is, balanced, biological, parents, have, a, much, higher, rate, of, abuse, than, stepparents, do, there, is, little, research, in, the, field, of, parental, abuse, by, children, in, concern, with, stepchildren, abusing, stepparents, the, abuse, of, stepchildren, by, their, siblings, is, also, a, topic, with, little, research, in, her, book, becoming, a, stepfamily, patricia, papernow, 1993, suggests, that, each, stepfamily, goes, through, seven, distinct, stages, of, development, which, can, be, divided, into, the, early, middle, and, late, stages, the, early, stages, consist, of, the, fantasy, immersion, and, awareness, stages, in, the, fantasy, stage, both, children, and, parents, are, typically, stuck, in, their, fantasies, or, wishes, for, what, their, family, could, be, like, the, developmental, task, for, this, stage, is, for, each, member, to, articulate, their, wants, and, needs, in, the, immersion, stage, the, family, is, typically, struggling, to, live, out, the, fantasy, of, a, perfect, blended, family, in, this, stage, it, is, critical, for, the, insider, spouse, i, e, the, biological, parent, who, typically, forms, the, emotional, hub, of, the, family, to, understand, that, the, feelings, of, the, outsider, spouse, and, children, are, real, the, task, of, this, stage, is, to, persist, in, the, struggle, to, become, aware, of, the, various, experiences, this, stage, is, followed, by, the, awareness, stage, in, which, the, family, gathers, information, about, what, the, new, family, looks, like, e, g, roles, traditions, family, culture, and, how, each, member, feels, about, it, the, tasks, of, this, stage, are, twofold, individual, and, joint, the, individual, task, is, for, each, member, to, begin, to, put, words, to, the, feelings, they, are, experiencing, and, to, voice, their, needs, to, other, family, members, the, joint, task, is, for, family, members, to, begin, to, transcend, the, experiential, gaps, and, to, try, to, form, an, understanding, of, other, members, roles, and, experiences, the, middle, stages, consist, of, the, mobilization, and, action, stages, in, the, mobilization, stage, the, stepparent, can, begin, to, step, forward, to, address, the, family, s, process, and, structure, the, tasks, of, this, stage, are, to, confront, differences, in, each, member, s, perception, of, the, new, family, as, well, as, to, influence, one, another, before, shaming, or, blaming, begins, to, take, action, to, reorganize, the, family, structure, the, goal, here, is, to, make, joint, decisions, about, new, stepfamily, rituals, rules, and, roles, the, focus, in, this, stage, is, on, the, stepfamily, s, unique, middle, ground, i, e, the, areas, of, shared, experience, shared, values, and, easy, cooperative, functioning, created, over, time, and, on, balancing, this, new, middle, ground, with, honoring, of, past, and, other, relationships, the, later, stages, consist, of, the, contact, and, resolution, stages, in, the, contact, stage, the, couple, is, working, well, together, the, boundaries, between, households, are, clear, and, stepparents, have, definite, roles, with, stepchildren, as, intimate, outsiders, the, task, for, this, stage, is, in, solidifying, the, stepparent, s, role, and, in, continuing, the, process, of, awareness, finally, in, the, resolution, stage, the, stepfamily, s, identity, has, become, secure, the, family, accepts, itself, for, who, it, is, there, is, a, strong, sense, of, the, stepfamily, s, middle, ground, and, children, feel, secure, in, both, households, the, task, for, this, stage, is, to, nourish, the, depth, and, maturity, gained, through, this, process, and, to, rework, any, issues, that, might, arise, at, family, nodal, events, e, g, weddings, funerals, graduations, etc, in, her, book, stepmonster, a, new, look, at, why, real, stepmothers, think, feel, and, act, the, way, we, do, social, researcher, wednesday, martin, takes, an, anthropological, approach, to, examining, stepfamily, dynamics, the, prevalence, of, stepfamilies, has, increased, over, the, past, century, with, the, increase, of, divorce, and, remarriage, according, to, the, step, family, foundation, over, 50, of, us, families, are, remarried, or, recoupled, these, families, are, unique, in, their, experiences, facing, many, challenges, which, first, married, families, do, not, for, example, role, ambiguity, dealing, with, stepchildren, and, ex, spouses, are, only, a, few, of, the, issues, which, are, unique, to, these, families, in, response, to, these, families, desire, for, assistance, stepfamily, education, has, become, an, increasingly, common, topic, among, scholars, and, educators, although, still, a, relatively, new, facet, within, the, marriage, education, realm, stepfamily, education, provides, important, information, which, may, not, be, addressed, in, traditional, marriage, or, relationship, education, curriculum, as, discussed, by, adler, baeder, and, higginbotham, 2004, a, number, of, curricula, are, currently, available, to, stepfamilies, and, family, life, educators, however, further, research, is, needed, in, order, to, determine, best, practices, for, the, field, one, way, in, which, this, gap, is, being, filled, is, through, the, current, implementation, of, healthy, marriage, demonstration, grants, in, the, u, s, as, part, of, the, deficit, reduction, act, of, 2005, grants, for, healthy, marriage, and, responsible, fatherhood, which, include, at, risk, and, diverse, populations, such, as, stepfamilies, are, providing, important, information, on, the, evaluation, of, stepfamily, programs, and, their, effectiveness, in, servicing, stepfamilies
