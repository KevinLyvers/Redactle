homosexuality, is, sexual, attraction, romantic, attraction, or, sexual, behavior, between, members, of, the, same, sex, or, gender, as, a, sexual, orientation, homosexuality, is, an, enduring, pattern, of, emotional, romantic, and, or, sexual, attractions, exclusively, to, people, of, the, same, sex, or, gender, it, also, refers, to, a, person, s, sense, of, identity, based, on, those, attractions, related, behaviors, and, membership, in, a, community, of, others, who, share, those, attractions, along, with, bisexuality, and, heterosexuality, homosexuality, is, one, of, the, three, main, categories, of, sexual, orientation, within, the, heterosexual, homosexual, continuum, scientists, do, not, yet, know, the, exact, cause, of, sexual, orientation, but, they, theorize, that, it, is, caused, by, a, complex, interplay, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, influences, and, do, not, view, it, as, a, choice, although, no, single, theory, on, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, has, yet, gained, widespread, support, scientists, favor, biologically, based, theories, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, which, suggests, parenting, or, early, childhood, experiences, play, a, role, with, regard, to, sexual, orientation, while, some, believe, that, homosexual, activity, is, unnatural, scientific, research, shows, that, homosexuality, is, a, normal, and, natural, variation, in, human, sexuality, and, is, not, in, and, of, itself, a, source, of, negative, psychological, effects, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, support, the, use, of, psychological, interventions, to, change, sexual, orientation, the, most, common, terms, for, homosexual, people, are, lesbian, for, females, and, gay, for, males, but, the, term, gay, also, commonly, refers, to, both, homosexual, females, and, males, other, common, labels, that, include, gay, people, are, lgbtq, and, queer, the, percentage, of, people, who, are, gay, or, lesbian, and, the, proportion, of, people, who, are, in, same, sex, romantic, relationships, or, have, had, same, sex, sexual, experiences, are, difficult, for, researchers, to, estimate, reliably, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, many, gay, and, lesbian, people, not, openly, identifying, as, such, due, to, prejudice, or, discrimination, such, as, homophobia, and, heterosexism, homosexual, behavior, has, also, been, documented, in, many, non, human, animal, species, though, humans, are, one, of, only, two, species, known, to, exhibit, a, homosexual, orientation, the, other, is, sheep, many, gay, and, lesbian, people, are, in, committed, same, sex, relationships, these, relationships, are, equivalent, to, heterosexual, relationships, in, essential, psychological, respects, homosexual, relationships, and, acts, have, been, admired, as, well, as, condemned, throughout, recorded, history, depending, on, the, form, they, took, and, the, culture, in, which, they, occurred, since, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, there, has, been, a, global, movement, towards, freedom, and, equality, for, gay, people, including, the, introduction, of, anti, bullying, legislation, to, protect, gay, children, at, school, legislation, ensuring, non, discrimination, equal, ability, to, serve, in, the, military, equal, access, to, health, care, equal, ability, to, adopt, and, parent, and, the, establishment, of, marriage, equality, the, word, homosexual, is, a, greek, and, latin, hybrid, with, the, first, element, derived, from, greek, homos, same, not, related, to, the, latin, homo, man, as, in, homo, sapiens, thus, connoting, sexual, acts, and, affections, between, members, of, the, same, sex, including, lesbianism, the, first, known, appearance, of, homosexual, in, print, is, found, in, an, 1868, letter, to, karl, heinrich, ulrichs, by, the, austrian, born, novelist, karl, maria, kertbeny, arguing, against, a, prussian, anti, sodomy, law, in, 1886, the, psychiatrist, richard, von, krafft, ebing, used, the, terms, homosexual, and, heterosexual, in, his, book, psychopathia, sexualis, krafft, ebing, s, book, was, so, popular, among, both, laymen, and, doctors, that, the, terms, heterosexual, and, homosexual, became, the, most, widely, accepted, terms, for, sexual, orientation, as, such, the, current, use, of, the, term, has, its, roots, in, the, broader, 19th, century, tradition, of, personality, taxonomy, many, modern, style, guides, in, the, u, s, recommend, against, using, homosexual, as, a, noun, instead, using, gay, man, or, lesbian, similarly, some, recommend, completely, avoiding, usage, of, homosexual, as, it, has, a, negative, clinical, history, and, because, the, word, only, refers, to, one, s, sexual, behavior, as, opposed, to, romantic, feelings, and, thus, it, has, a, negative, connotation, gay, and, lesbian, are, the, most, common, alternatives, the, first, letters, are, frequently, combined, to, create, the, initialism, lgbt, sometimes, written, as, glbt, in, which, b, and, t, refer, to, bisexual, and, transgender, people, gay, especially, refers, to, male, homosexuality, but, may, be, used, in, a, broader, sense, to, refer, to, all, lgbt, people, in, the, context, of, sexuality, lesbian, refers, only, to, female, homosexuality, the, word, lesbian, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, greek, island, lesbos, where, the, poet, sappho, wrote, largely, about, her, emotional, relationships, with, young, women, although, early, writers, also, used, the, adjective, homosexual, to, refer, to, any, single, sex, context, such, as, an, all, girls, school, today, the, term, is, used, exclusively, in, reference, to, sexual, attraction, activity, and, orientation, the, term, homosocial, is, now, used, to, describe, single, sex, contexts, that, are, not, specifically, sexual, there, is, also, a, word, referring, to, same, sex, love, homophilia, some, synonyms, for, same, sex, attraction, or, sexual, activity, include, men, who, have, sex, with, men, or, msm, used, in, the, medical, community, when, specifically, discussing, sexual, activity, and, homoerotic, referring, to, works, of, art, pejorative, terms, in, english, include, queer, faggot, fairy, poof, poofter, and, homo, beginning, in, the, 1990s, some, of, these, have, been, reclaimed, as, positive, words, by, gay, men, and, lesbians, as, in, the, usage, of, queer, studies, queer, theory, and, even, the, popular, american, television, program, queer, eye, for, the, straight, guy, the, word, homo, occurs, in, many, other, languages, without, the, pejorative, connotations, it, has, in, english, as, with, ethnic, slurs, and, racial, slurs, the, use, of, these, terms, can, still, be, highly, offensive, the, range, of, acceptable, use, for, these, terms, depends, on, the, context, and, speaker, conversely, gay, a, word, originally, embraced, by, homosexual, men, and, women, as, a, positive, affirmative, term, as, in, gay, liberation, and, gay, rights, came, into, widespread, pejorative, use, among, young, people, in, the, early, 2000s, the, american, lgbt, rights, organization, glaad, advises, the, media, to, avoid, using, the, term, homosexual, to, describe, gay, people, or, same, sex, relationships, as, the, term, is, frequently, used, by, anti, gay, extremists, to, denigrate, gay, people, couples, and, relationships, some, scholars, argue, that, the, term, homosexuality, is, problematic, when, applied, to, ancient, cultures, since, for, example, neither, greeks, or, romans, possessed, any, one, word, covering, the, same, semantic, range, as, the, modern, concept, of, homosexuality, nor, did, there, exist, a, distinction, of, lifestyle, or, differentiation, of, psychological, or, behavioral, profiles, in, the, ancient, world, however, there, were, diverse, sexual, practices, that, varied, in, acceptance, depending, on, time, and, place, in, ancient, greece, the, pattern, of, adolescent, boys, engaging, in, sexual, practices, with, older, males, did, not, constitute, a, homosexual, identity, in, the, modern, sense, since, such, relations, were, seen, as, phases, in, life, not, permanent, orientations, since, later, on, the, younger, partners, would, commonly, marry, females, and, reproduce, other, scholars, argue, that, there, are, significant, continuities, between, ancient, and, modern, homosexuality, in, cultures, influenced, by, abrahamic, religions, the, law, and, the, church, established, sodomy, as, a, transgression, against, divine, law, or, a, crime, against, nature, the, condemnation, of, anal, sex, between, males, however, predates, christian, belief, throughout, the, majority, of, christian, history, most, christian, theologians, and, denominations, have, considered, homosexual, behavior, as, immoral, or, sinful, condemnation, was, frequent, in, ancient, greece, for, instance, the, idea, of, male, anal, sex, being, unnatural, is, described, by, a, character, of, plato, s, though, he, had, earlier, written, of, the, benefits, of, homosexual, relationships, many, historical, figures, including, socrates, lord, byron, edward, ii, and, hadrian, have, had, terms, such, as, gay, or, bisexual, applied, to, them, some, scholars, have, regarded, uses, of, such, modern, terms, on, people, from, the, past, as, an, anachronistic, introduction, of, a, contemporary, construction, of, sexuality, that, would, have, been, foreign, to, their, times, other, scholars, see, continuity, instead, in, social, science, there, has, been, a, dispute, between, essentialist, and, constructionist, views, of, homosexuality, the, debate, divides, those, who, believe, that, terms, such, as, gay, and, straight, refer, to, objective, culturally, invariant, properties, of, persons, from, those, who, believe, that, the, experiences, they, name, are, artifacts, of, unique, cultural, and, social, processes, essentialists, typically, believe, that, sexual, preferences, are, determined, by, biological, forces, while, constructionists, assume, that, sexual, desires, are, learned, the, philosopher, of, science, michael, ruse, has, stated, that, the, social, constructionist, approach, which, is, influenced, by, foucault, is, based, on, a, selective, reading, of, the, historical, record, that, confuses, the, existence, of, homosexual, people, with, the, way, in, which, they, are, labelled, or, treated, the, first, record, of, a, possible, homosexual, couple, in, history, is, commonly, regarded, as, khnumhotep, and, niankhkhnum, an, ancient, egyptian, male, couple, who, lived, around, 2400, bce, the, pair, are, portrayed, in, a, nose, kissing, position, the, most, intimate, pose, in, egyptian, art, surrounded, by, what, appear, to, be, their, heirs, the, anthropologists, stephen, murray, and, will, roscoe, reported, that, women, in, lesotho, engaged, in, socially, sanctioned, long, term, erotic, relationships, called, motsoalle, the, anthropologist, e, e, evans, pritchard, also, recorded, that, male, azande, warriors, in, the, northern, congo, routinely, took, on, young, male, lovers, between, the, ages, of, twelve, and, twenty, who, helped, with, household, tasks, and, participated, in, intercrural, sex, with, their, older, husbands, as, is, true, of, many, other, non, western, cultures, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, extent, to, which, western, notions, of, sexual, orientation, and, gender, identity, apply, to, pre, columbian, cultures, evidence, of, homoerotic, sexual, acts, and, transvestism, has, been, found, in, many, pre, conquest, civilizations, in, latin, america, such, as, the, aztecs, mayas, quechuas, moches, zapotecs, the, incas, and, the, tupinamb, of, brazil, the, spanish, conquerors, were, horrified, to, discover, sodomy, openly, practiced, among, native, peoples, and, attempted, to, crush, it, out, by, subjecting, the, berdaches, as, the, spanish, called, them, under, their, rule, to, severe, penalties, including, public, execution, burning, and, being, torn, to, pieces, by, dogs, the, spanish, conquerors, talked, extensively, of, sodomy, among, the, natives, to, depict, them, as, savages, and, hence, justify, their, conquest, and, forceful, conversion, to, christianity, as, a, result, of, the, growing, influence, and, power, of, the, conquerors, many, native, cultures, started, condemning, homosexual, acts, themselves, among, some, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, in, north, america, prior, to, european, colonization, a, relatively, common, form, of, same, sex, sexuality, centered, around, the, figure, of, the, two, spirit, individual, the, term, itself, was, coined, only, in, 1990, typically, this, individual, was, recognized, early, in, life, given, a, choice, by, the, parents, to, follow, the, path, and, if, the, child, accepted, the, role, raised, in, the, appropriate, manner, learning, the, customs, of, the, gender, it, had, chosen, two, spirit, individuals, were, commonly, shamans, and, were, revered, as, having, powers, beyond, those, of, ordinary, shamans, their, sexual, life, was, with, the, ordinary, tribe, members, of, the, same, sex, during, the, colonial, times, following, the, european, invasion, homosexuality, was, prosecuted, by, the, inquisition, sometimes, leading, to, death, sentences, on, the, charges, of, sodomy, and, the, practices, became, clandestine, many, homosexual, individuals, went, into, heterosexual, marriages, to, maintain, appearances, and, many, joined, the, unmarried, catholic, clergy, to, escape, public, scrutiny, of, their, lack, of, interest, in, the, opposite, sex, during, the, colonial, period, both, the, french, and, the, british, criminalised, same, sex, sexual, relations, anal, sex,

were, prosecuted, for, same, sex, sexual, activity, as, late, as, the, 1960s, which, led, to, the, federal, parliament, amending, the, criminal, code, in, 1969, to, provide, that, anal, sex, between, consenting, adults, in, private, defined, as, only, two, persons, was, not, a, criminal, offence, in, advocating, for, the, law, the, then, minister, of, justice, pierre, trudeau, said, the, state, has, no, place, in, the, bedrooms, of, the, nation, in, 1995, the, supreme, court, of, canada, held, that, sexual, orientation, is, a, protected, personal, characteristic, under, the, equality,

widespread, practice, of, same, sex, love, engaged, in, by, a, considerable, part, of, the, male, population, and, constructed, along, the, classical, pattern, of, greece, and, rome, but, even, as, many, of, the, male, population, were, engaging, in, same, sex, relationships, the, authorities, under, the, aegis, of, the, officers, of, the, night, court, were, prosecuting, fining, and,

latin, to, obscure, the, sexual, details, were, not, widely, read, by, the, general, public, they, did, lead, to, the, rise, of, magnus, hirschfeld, s, scientific, humanitarian, committee, which, campaigned, from, 1897, to, 1933, against, anti, sodomy, laws, in, germany, as, well, as, a, much, more, informal, unpublicized, movement, among, british, intellectuals, and, writers, led, by, such,

ahmadinejad, during, his, 2007, speech, at, columbia, university, asserted, that, there, were, no, gay, people, in, iran, however, the, probable, reason, is, that, they, keep, their, sexuality, a, secret, for, fear, of, government, sanction, or, rejection, by, their, families, in, ancient, sumer, a, set, of, priests, known, as, gala, worked, in, the, temples, of, the, goddess, inanna, where, they, performed, elegies, and, lamentations, 285, gala, took, female, names, spoke, in, the, eme, sal, dialect, which, was, traditionally, reserved, for, women, and, appear, to, have, engaged, in,

divine, blessings, on, homosexual, relationships, the, almanac, of, incantations, contained, prayers, favoring, on, an, equal, basis, the, love, of, a, man, for, a, woman, of, a, woman, for, a, man, and, of, a, man, for, man, in, some, societies, of, melanesia, especially, in, papua, new, guinea, same, sex, relationships, were, an, integral, part, of, the, culture, until, the, mid, 1900s, the, etoro, and, marind, anim, for, example, viewed, heterosexuality, as, unclean, and, celebrated, homosexuality, instead, in, some, traditional, melanesian, cultures, a, prepubertal, boy, would, be, paired, with, an, older, adolescent, who, would, become, his, mentor, and, who, would, inseminate, him, orally, anally, or, topically, depending, on, the, tribe, over, a, number, of, years, in, order, for, the, younger, to, also, reach, puberty, many, melanesian, societies, however, have, become, hostile, towards, same, sex, relationships, since, the, introduction, of, christianity, by, european, missionaries, the, american, psychological, association, the, american, psychiatric, association, and, the, national, association, of, social, workers, identify, sexual, orientation, as, not, merely, a, personal, characteristic, that, can, be, defined, in, isolation, rather, one, s, sexual, orientation, defines, the, universe, of, persons, with, whom, one, is, likely, to, find, the, satisfying, and, fulfilling, relationships, sexual, orientation, is, commonly, discussed, as, a, characteristic, of, the, individual, like, biological, sex, gender, identity, or, age, this, perspective, is, incomplete, because, sexual, orientation, is, always, defined, in, relational, terms, and, necessarily, involves, relationships, with, other, individuals, sexual, acts, and, romantic, attractions, are, categorized, as, homosexual, or, heterosexual, according, to, the, biological, sex, of, the, individuals, involved, in, them, relative, to, each, other, indeed, it, is, by, acting, or, desiring, to, act, with, another, person, that, individuals, express, their, heterosexuality, homosexuality, or, bisexuality, this, includes, actions, as, simple, as, holding, hands, with, or, kissing, another, person, thus, sexual, orientation, is, integrally, linked, to, the, intimate, personal, relationships, that, human, beings, form, with, others, to, meet, their, deeply, felt, needs, for, love, attachment, and, intimacy, in, addition, to, sexual, behavior, these, bonds, encompass, nonsexual, physical, affection, between, partners, shared, goals, and, values, mutual, support, and, ongoing, commitment, the, kinsey, scale, also, called, the, heterosexual, homosexual, rating, scale, attempts, to, describe, a, person, s, sexual, history, or, episodes, of, his, or, her, sexual, activity, at, a, given, time, it, uses, a, scale, from, 0, meaning, exclusively, heterosexual, to, 6, meaning, exclusively, homosexual, in, both, the, male, and, female, volumes, of, the, kinsey, reports, an, additional, grade, listed, as, x, has, been, interpreted, by, scholars, to, indicate, asexuality, often, sexual, orientation, and, sexual, identity, are, not, distinguished, which, can, impact, accurately, assessing, sexual, identity, and, whether, or, not, sexual, orientation, is, able, to, change, sexual, orientation, identity, can, change, throughout, an, individual, s, life, and, may, or, may, not, align, with, biological, sex, sexual, behavior, or, actual, sexual, orientation, sexual, orientation, is, stable, and, unlikely, to, change, for, the, vast, majority, of, people, but, some, research, indicates, that, some, people, may, experience, change, in, their, sexual, orientation, and, this, is, more, likely, for, women, than, for, men, the, american, psychological, association, distinguishes, between, sexual, orientation, an, innate, attraction, and, sexual, orientation, identity, which, may, change, at, any, point, in, a, person, s, life, people, with, a, homosexual, orientation, can, express, their, sexuality, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, may, or, may, not, express, it, in, their, behaviors, many, have, sexual, relationships, predominantly, with, people, of, their, own, sex, though, some, have, sexual, relationships, with, those, of, the, opposite, sex, bisexual, relationships, or, none, at, all, celibacy, studies, have, found, same, sex, and, opposite, sex, couples, to, be, equivalent, to, each, other, in, measures, of, satisfaction, and, commitment, in, relationships, that, age, and, sex, are, more, reliable, than, sexual, orientation, as, a, predictor, of, satisfaction, and, commitment, to, a, relationship, and, that, people, who, are, heterosexual, or, homosexual, share, comparable, expectations, and, ideals, with, regard, to, romantic, relationships, coming, out, of, the, closet, is, a, phrase, referring, to, one, s, disclosure, of, their, sexual, orientation, or, gender, identity, and, is, described, and, experienced, variously, as, a, psychological, process, or, journey, generally, coming, out, is, described, in, three, phases, the, first, phase, is, that, of, knowing, oneself, and, the, realization, emerges, that, one, is, open, to, same, sex, relations, this, is, often, described, as, an, internal, coming, out, the, second, phase, involves, one, s, decision, to, come, out, to, others, e, g, family, friends, or, colleagues, the, third, phase, more, generally, involves, living, openly, as, an, lgbt, person, in, the, united, states, today, people, often, come, out, during, high, school, or, college, age, at, this, age, they, may, not, trust, or, ask, for, help, from, others, especially, when, their, orientation, is, not, accepted, in, society, sometimes, their, own, families, are, not, even, informed, according, to, rosario, schrimshaw, hunter, braun, 2006, the, development, of, a, lesbian, gay, or, bisexual, lgb, sexual, identity, is, a, complex, and, often, difficult, process, unlike, members, of, other, minority, groups, e, g, ethnic, and, racial, minorities, most, lgb, individuals, are, not, raised, in, a, community, of, similar, others, from, whom, they, learn, about, their, identity, and, who, reinforce, and, support, that, identity, rather, lgb, individuals, are, often, raised, in, communities, that, are, either, ignorant, of, or, openly, hostile, toward, homosexuality, outing, is, the, practice, of, publicly, revealing, the, sexual, orientation, of, a, closeted, person, notable, politicians, celebrities, military, service, people, and, clergy, members, have, been, outed, with, motives, ranging, from, malice, to, political, or, moral, beliefs, many, commentators, oppose, the, practice, altogether, while, some, encourage, outing, public, figures, who, use, their, positions, of, influence, to, harm, other, gay, people, homosexuality, is, not, to, be, confused, with, homoromanticism, which, is, the, romantic, attraction, to, the, same, sex, or, gender, most, people, who, are, homosexual, are, also, homoromantic, but, some, people, under, the, asexual, spectrum, do, not, experience, or, experience, limited, homosexuality, for, example, homoromantic, heterosexuals, are, described, as, romantically, attracted, to, the, same, or, a, similar, gender, while, only, being, sexually, attracted, to, the, opposite, gender, in, their, 2016, literature, review, bailey, et, al, stated, that, they, expect, that, in, all, cultures, a, minority, of, individuals, are, sexually, predisposed, whether, exclusively, or, non, exclusively, to, the, same, sex, they, state, that, there, is, no, persuasive, evidence, that, the, demographics, of, sexual, orientation, have, varied, much, across, time, or, place, men, are, more, likely, to, be, exclusively, homosexual, than, to, be, equally, attracted, to, both, sexes, while, the, opposite, is, true, for, women, surveys, in, western, cultures, find, on, average, that, about, 93, of, men, and, 87, of, women, identify, as, completely, heterosexual, 4, of, men, and, 10, of, women, as, mostly, heterosexual, 0, 5, of, men, and, 1, of, women, as, evenly, bisexual, 0, 5, of, men, and, 0, 5, of, women, as, mostly, homosexual, and, 2, of, men, and, 0, 5, of, women, as, completely, homosexual, an, analysis, of, 67, studies, found, that, the, lifetime, prevalence, of, sex, between, men, regardless, of, orientation, was, 3, 5, for, east, asia, 6, 12, for, south, and, south, east, asia, 6, 15, for, eastern, europe, and, 6, 20, for, latin, america, the, international, hiv, aids, alliance, estimates, that, worldwide, between, 3, and, 16, of, men, have, had, some, form, of, sex, with, another, man, at, least, once, during, their, lifetime, according, to, major, studies, 2, to, 11, of, people, have, had, some, form, of, same, sex, sexual, contact, within, their, lifetime, this, percentage, rises, to, 16, 21, when, either, or, both, same, sex, attraction, and, behavior, are, reported, according, to, the, 2021, united, states, census, there, were, about, 1, 2, million, same, sex, couple, households, in, the, united, states, according, to, a, report, by, the, williams, institute, in, april, 2011, 3, 5, or, approximately, 9, million, of, the, adult, population, identify, as, lesbian, gay, or, bisexual, a, 2013, study, by, the, cdc, in, which, over, 34, 000, americans, were, interviewed, puts, the, percentage, of, self, identifying, lesbians, and, gay, men, at, 1, 6, and, of, bisexuals, at, 0, 7, in, october, 2012, gallup, started, conducting, annual, surveys, to, study, the, demographics, of, lgbt, people, determining, that, 3, 4, 1, of, adults, identified, as, lgbt, in, the, united, states, it, was, the, nation, s, largest, poll, on, the, issue, at, the, time, in, 2017, the, percentage, was, estimated, to, have, risen, to, 4, 5, of, adults, with, the, increase, largely, driven, by, millennials, the, poll, attributes, the, rise, to, greater, willingness, of, younger, people, to, reveal, their, sexual, identity, measuring, the, prevalence, of, homosexuality, presents, difficulties, it, is, necessary, to, consider, the, measuring, criteria, that, are, used, the, cutoff, point, and, the, time, span, taken, to, define, a, sexual, orientation, many, people, despite, having, same, sex, attractions, may, be, reluctant, to, identify, themselves, as, gay, or, bisexual, the, research, must, measure, some, characteristic, that, may, or, may, not, be, defining, of, sexual, orientation, the, number, of, people, with, same, sex, desires, may, be, larger, than, the, number, of, people, who, act, on, those, desires, which, in, turn, may, be, larger, than, the, number, of, people, who, self, identify, as, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, reliable, data, as, to, the, size, of, the, gay, and, lesbian, population, are, of, value, in, informing, public, policy, for, example, demographics, are, of, help, in, calculating, the, costs, and, benefits, of, domestic, partnership, benefits, of, the, impact, of, legalizing, gay, adoption, and, of, the, impact, of, the, u, s, military, s, former, don, t, ask, don, t, tell, policy, further, knowledge, of, the, size, of, the, gay, and, lesbian, population, holds, promise, for, helping, social, scientists, understand, a, wide, array, of, important, questions, questions, about, the, general, nature, of, labor, market, choices, accumulation, of, human, capital, specialization, within, households, discrimination, and, decisions, about, geographic, location, the, american, psychological, association, the, american, psychiatric, association, and, the, national, association, of, social, workers, state, in, 1952, when, the, american, psychiatric, association, published, its, first, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, homosexuality, was, included, as, a, disorder, almost, immediately, however, that, classification, began, to, be, subjected, to, critical, scrutiny, in, research, funded, by, the, national, institute, of, mental, health, that, study, and, subsequent, research, consistently, failed, to, produce, any, empirical, or, scientific, basis, for, regarding, homosexuality, as, a, disorder, or, abnormality, rather, than, a, normal, and, healthy, sexual, orientation, as, results, from, such, research, accumulated, professionals, in, medicine, mental, health, and, the, behavioral, and, social, sciences, reached, the, conclusion, that, it, was, inaccurate, to, classify, homosexuality, as, a, mental, disorder, and, that, the, dsm, classification, reflected, untested, assumptions, based, on, once, prevalent, social, norms, and, clinical, impressions, from, unrepresentative, samples, comprising, patients, seeking, therapy, and, individuals, whose, conduct, brought, them, into, the, criminal, justice, system, in, recognition, of, the, scientific, evidence, the, american, psychiatric, association, removed, homosexuality, from, the, dsm, in, 1973, stating, that, homosexuality, per, se, implies, no, impairment, in, judgment, stability, reliability, or, general, social, or, vocational, capabilities, after, thoroughly, reviewing, the, scientific, data, the, american, psychological, association, adopted, the, same, position, in, 1975, and, urged, all, mental, health, professionals, to, take, the, lead, in, removing, the, stigma, of, mental, illness, that, has, long, been, associated, with, homosexual, orientations, the, national, association, of, social, workers, has, adopted, a, similar, policy, thus, mental, health, professionals, and, researchers, have, long, recognized, that, being, homosexual, poses, no, inherent, obstacle, to, leading, a, happy, healthy, and, productive, life, and, that, the, vast, majority, of, gay, and, lesbian, people, function, well, in, the, full, array, of, social, institutions, and, interpersonal, relationships, the, consensus, of, research, and, clinical, literature, demonstrates, that, same, sex, sexual, and, romantic, attractions, feelings, and, behaviors, are, normal, and, positive, variations, of, human, sexuality, there, is, now, a, large, body, of, research, evidence, that, indicates, that, being, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, is, compatible, with, normal, mental, health, and, social, adjustment, the, world, health, organization, s, icd, 9, 1977, listed, homosexuality, as, a, mental, illness, it, was, removed, from, the, icd, 10, endorsed, by, the, forty, third, world, health, assembly, on, 17, may, 1990, like, the, dsm, ii, the, icd, 10, added, ego, dystonic, sexual, orientation, to, the, list, which, refers, to, people, who, want, to, change, their, gender, identities, or, sexual, orientation, because, of, a, psychological, or, behavioral, disorder, f66, 1, the, chinese, society, of, psychiatry, removed, homosexuality, from, its, chinese, classification, of, mental, disorders, in, 2001, after, five, years, of, study, by, the, association, according, to, the, royal, college, of, psychiatrists, this, unfortunate, history, demonstrates, how, marginalisation, of, a, group, of, people, who, have, a, particular, personality, feature, in, this, case, homosexuality, can, lead, to, harmful, medical, practice, and, a, basis, for, discrimination, in, society, most, lesbian, gay, and, bisexual, people, who, seek, psychotherapy, do, so, for, the, same, reasons, as, heterosexual, people, stress, relationship, difficulties, difficulty, adjusting, to, social, or, work, situations, etc, their, sexual, orientation, may, be, of, primary, incidental, or, no, importance, to, their, issues, and, treatment, whatever, the, issue, there, is, a, high, risk, for, anti, gay, bias, in, psychotherapy, with, lesbian, gay, and, bisexual, clients, psychological, research, in, this, area, has, been, relevant, to, counteracting, prejudicial, homophobic, attitudes, and, actions, and, to, the, lgbt, rights, movement, generally, the, appropriate, application, of, affirmative, psychotherapy, is, based, on, the, following, scientific, facts, there, are, no, studies, of, adequate, scientific, rigor, that, conclude, that, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, work, to, change, a, person, s, sexual, orientation, those, efforts, have, been, controversial, due, to, tensions, between, the, values, held, by, some, faith, based, organizations, on, the, one, hand, and, those, held, by, lgbt, rights, organizations, and, professional, and, scientific, organizations, and, other, faith, based, organizations, on, the, other, the, longstanding, consensus, of, the, behavioral, and, social, sciences, and, the, health, and, mental, health, professions, is, that, homosexuality, per, se, is, a, normal, and, positive, variation, of, human, sexual, orientation, and, therefore, not, a, mental, disorder, the, american, psychological, association, says, that, most, people, experience, little, or, no, sense, of, choice, about, their, sexual, orientation, some, individuals, and, groups, have, promoted, the, idea, of, homosexuality, as, symptomatic, of, developmental, defects, or, spiritual, and, moral, failings, and, have, argued, that, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, including, psychotherapy, and, religious, efforts, could, alter, homosexual, feelings, and, behaviors, many, of, these, individuals, and, groups, appeared, to, be, embedded, within, the, larger, context, of, conservative, religious, political, movements, that, have, supported, the, stigmatization, of, homosexuality, on, political, or, religious, grounds, no, major, mental, health, professional, organization, has, sanctioned, efforts, to, change, sexual, orientation, and, virtually, all, of, them, have, adopted, policy, statements, cautioning, the, profession, and, the, public, about, treatments, that, purport, to, change, sexual, orientation, these, include, the, american, psychiatric, association, american, psychological, association, american, counseling, association, national, association, of, social, workers, in, the, u, s, the, royal, college, of, psychiatrists, and, the, australian, psychological, society, the, american, psychological, association, and, the, royal, college, of, psychiatrists, expressed, concerns, that, the, positions, espoused, by, narth, are, not, supported, by, the, science, and, create, an, environment, in, which, prejudice, and, discrimination, can, flourish, the, american, psychiatric, association, says, individuals, maybe, become, aware, at, different, points, in, their, lives, that, they, are, heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, and, opposes, any, psychiatric, treatment, such, as, reparative, or, conversion, therapy, which, is, based, upon, the, assumption, that, homosexuality, per, se, is, a, mental, disorder, or, based, upon, a, prior, assumption, that, the, patient, should, change, his, her, homosexual, orientation, they, do, however, encourage, gay, affirmative, psychotherapy, similarly, the, american, psychological, association, is, doubtful, about, the, effectiveness, and, side, effect, profile, of, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, including, conversion, therapy, the, american, psychological, association, encourages, mental, health, professionals, to, avoid, misrepresenting, the, efficacy, of, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, by, promoting, or, promising, change, in, sexual, orientation, when, providing, assistance, to, individuals, distressed, by, their, own, or, others, sexual, orientation, and, concludes, that, the, benefits, reported, by, participants, in, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, can, be, gained, through, approaches, that, do, not, attempt, to, change, sexual, orientation, although, scientists, favor, biological, models, for, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, they, do, not, believe, that, the, development, of, sexual, orientation, is, the, result, of, any, one, factor, they, generally, believe, that, it, is, determined, by, a, complex, interplay, of, biological, and, environmental, factors, and, is, shaped, at, an, early, age, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, which, suggests, parenting, or, early, childhood, experiences, play, a, role, with, regard, to, sexual, orientation, scientists, do, not, believe, that, sexual, orientation, is, a, choice, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, stated, in, pediatrics, in, 2004, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, that, abnormal, parenting, sexual, abuse, or, other, adverse, life, events, influence, sexual, orientation, current, knowledge, suggests, that, sexual, orientation, is, usually, established, during, early, childhood, the, american, psychological, association, american, psychiatric, association, and, national, association, of, social, workers, stated, in, 2006, currently, there, is, no, scientific, consensus, about, the, specific, factors, that, cause, an, individual, to, become, heterosexual, homosexual, or, bisexual, including, possible, biological, psychological, or, social, effects, of, the, parents, sexual, orientation, however, the, available, evidence, indicates, that, the, vast, majority, of, lesbian, and, gay, adults, were, raised, by, heterosexual, parents, and, the, vast, majority, of, children, raised, by, lesbian, and, gay, parents, eventually, grow, up, to, be, heterosexual, despite, numerous, attempts, no, gay, gene, has, been, identified, however, there, is, substantial, evidence, for, a, genetic, basis, of, homosexuality, especially, in, males, based, on, twin, studies, some, association, with, regions, of, chromosome, 8, the, xq28, locus, on, the, x, chromosome, and, other, sites, across, many, chromosomes, sanders, et, al, 2015, sanders, et, al, 2015, sanders, et, al, 2017, starting, in, the, 2010s, potential, epigenetic, factors, have, become, a, topic, of, increased, attention, in, genetic, research, on, sexual, orientation, a, study, presented, at, the, ashg, 2015, annual, meeting, found, that, the, methylation, pattern, in, nine, regions, of, the, genome, appeared, very, closely, linked, to, sexual, orientation, with, a, resulting, algorithm, using, the, methylation, pattern, to, predict, the, sexual, orientation, of, a, control, group, with, almost, 70, accuracy, research, into, the, causes, of, homosexuality, plays, a, role, in, political, and, social, debates, and, also, raises, concerns, about, genetic, profiling, and, prenatal, testing, since, homosexuality, tends, to, lower, reproductive, success, and, since, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, human, sexual, orientation, is, genetically, influenced, it, is, unclear, how, it, is, maintained, in, the, population, at, a, relatively, high, frequency, there, are, many, possible, explanations, such, as, genes, predisposing, to, homosexuality, also, conferring, advantage, in, heterosexuals, a, kin, selection, effect, social, prestige, and, more, a, 2009, study, also, suggested, a, significant, increase, in, fecundity, in, the, females, related, to, homosexual, people, from, the, maternal, line, but, not, in, those, related, from, the, paternal, one, scientific, research, has, been, generally, consistent, in, showing, that, lesbian, and, gay, parents, are, as, fit, and, capable, as, heterosexual, parents, and, their, children, are, as, psychologically, healthy, and, well, adjusted, as, children, reared, by, heterosexual, parents, according, to, scientific, literature, reviews, there, is, no, evidence, to, the, contrary, some, research, has, examined, the, sexual, orientation, of, children, raised, by, same, sex, couples, a, 2005, review, of, studies, by, charlotte, j, patterson, for, the, american, psychological, association, did, not, find, higher, rates, of, homosexuality, among, the, children, of, lesbian, or, gay, parents, according, to, bailey, et, al, 2016, available, data, do, not, suggest, higher, rates, of, non, heterosexuality, among, children, of, same, sex, couples, however, they, state, that, even, given, a, modest, heritability, of, sexual, orientation, it, would, be, expected, that, biological, children, of, non, heterosexuals, would, be, more, likely, to, have, a, non, heterosexual, orientation, due, to, genes, alone, according, to, a, 2011, data, 80, of, the, children, being, raised, by, same, sex, couples, in, the, us, are, their, own, biological, children, in, addition, accepting, social, environments, may, facilitate, the, open, expression, of, individuals, same, sex, attraction, thus, it, is, necessary, to, control, for, various, confounding, factors, one, study, by, bailey, et, al, found, that, the, sexual, orientation, of, sons, raised, by, gay, men, was, not, related, to, length, of, time, they, had, lived, with, their, fathers, social, theories, of, homosexuality, would, predict, sons, who, lived, with, a, gay, father, the, longest, would, be, most, likely, to, be, gay, the, bailey, et, al, review, conclude, that, social, environmental, influence, on, male, sexual, orientation, is, not, well, supported, while, it, remains, more, plausible, for, female, sexual, orientation, the, terms, men, who, have, sex, with, men, msm, and, women, who, have, sex, with, women, wsw, refer, to, people, who, engage, in, sexual, activity, with, others, of, the, same, sex, regardless, of, how, they, identify, themselves, as, many, choose, not, to, accept, social, identities, as, lesbian, gay, and, bisexual, these, terms, are, often, used, in, medical, literature, and, social, research, to, describe, such, groups, for, study, without, needing, to, consider, the, issues, of, sexual, self, identity, the, terms, are, seen, as, problematic, by, some, however, because, they, obscure, social, dimensions, of, sexuality, undermine, the, self, labeling, of, lesbian, gay, and, bisexual, people, and, do, not, sufficiently, describe, variations, in, sexual, behavior, in, contrast, to, its, benefits, sexual,

was, first, described, in, medical, literature, homosexuality, was, often, approached, from, a, view, that, sought, to, find, an, inherent, psychopathology, as, its, root, cause, much, literature, on, mental, health, and, homosexual, patients, centered, on, their, depression, substance, abuse, and, suicide, although, these, issues, exist, among, people, who, are, non, heterosexual, discussion, about, their, causes, shifted, after, homosexuality, was, removed, from, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, dsm, in, 1973, instead, social, ostracism, legal, discrimination, internalization, of, negative, stereotypes, and, limited, support, structures, indicate, factors, homosexual, people, face, in, western, societies, that, often, adversely, affect, their, mental, health, stigma,

bisexuals, compared, to, their, heterosexual, peers, evidence, indicates, that, the, liberalization, of, these, attitudes, is, associated, with, a, decrease, in, such, mental, health, risks, among, younger, sexual, minority, people, gay, and, lesbian, youth, bear, an, increased, risk, of, suicide, substance, abuse, school, problems, and, isolation, because, of, a, hostile, and, condemning,

or, caretakers, and, more, sexual, abuse, suggested, reasons, for, this, disparity, are, that, 1, lgbt, youths, may, be, specifically, targeted, on, the, basis, of, their, perceived, sexual, orientation, or, gender, non, conforming, appearance, and, 2, that, risk, factors, associated, with, sexual, minority, status, including, discrimination, invisibility, and, rejection, by, family, members, may, lead, to, an, increase, in, behaviors, that, are, associated, with, risk, for, victimization, such, as, substance, abuse, sex, with, multiple, partners, or, running, away, from, home,

can, face, the, death, penalty, in, islamic, countries, and, jurisdictions, ruled, by, sharia, there, are, however, often, significant, differences, between, official, policy, and, real, world, enforcement, although, homosexual, acts, were, decriminalized, in, some, parts, of, the, western, world, such, as, poland, in, 1932, denmark, in, 1933, sweden, in, 1944, and, england, and, wales, in, 1967, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 1970s, that, the, gay, community, first, began, to, achieve, limited, civil, rights, in, some, developed, countries, a, turning, point, was, reached, in, 1973, when, the, american, psychiatric, association, which, previously, listed, homosexuality, in, the, dsm, i, in, 1952, removed, homosexuality, in, the, dsm, ii, in, recognition, of, scientific, evidence, in, 1977, quebec, became, the, first, state, level, jurisdiction, in, the, world, to, prohibit, discrimination, on, the, grounds, of, sexual, orientation, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, several,

all, of, which, are, predominantly, islamic, and, governed, according, to, sharia, law, have, imposed, the, death, penalty, for, homosexuality, these, include, afghanistan, iran, brunei, mauritania,

the, charter, of, fundamental, rights, of, the, european, union, since, the, 1960s, many, lgbt, people, in, the, west, particularly, those, in, major, metropolitan, areas, have, developed, a, so, called, gay, culture, to, many, gay, culture, is, exemplified, by, the, gay, pride, movement, with, annual, parades, and, displays, of, rainbow, flags, yet, not, all, lgbt, people, choose, to, participate, in, queer, culture, and, many, gay, men, and, women, specifically, decline, to, do, so, to, some, it, seems, to, be, a, frivolous, display, perpetuating, gay, stereotypes, with, the, outbreak, of, aids, in, the, early, 1980s, many, lgbt, groups, and, individuals, organized, campaigns, to, promote, efforts, in, aids, education, prevention, research, patient, support, and, community, outreach, as, well, as, to, demand, government, support, for, these, programs, the, death, toll, wrought, by, the, aids, epidemic, at, first, seemed, to, slow, the, progress, of, the, gay, rights, movement, but, in, time, it, galvanized, some, parts, of, the, lgbt, community, into, community, service, and, political, action, and, challenged, the, heterosexual, community, to, respond, compassionately, major, american, motion, pictures, from, this, period, that, dramatized, the, response, of, individuals, and, communities, to, the, aids, crisis, include, an, early, frost, 1985,

a, variety, of, individuals, and, organizations, some, social, conservatives, believe, that, all, sexual, relationships, with, people, other, than, an, opposite, sex, spouse, undermine, the, traditional, family, and, that, children, should, be, reared, in, homes, with, both, a, father, and, a, mother, some, argue, that, gay, rights, may, conflict, with, individuals, freedom, of, speech, religious, freedoms, in, the, workplace, the, ability, to, run, churches, charitable, organizations, and, other, religious, organizations, in, accordance, with, one, s, religious, views, and, that, the, acceptance, of, homosexual, relationships, by, religious, organizations, might, be, forced, through, threatening, to, remove, the, tax, exempt, status, of, churches, whose, views, do, not, align, with, those, of, the, government, some, critics, charge, that, political, correctness, has, led, to, the, association, of, sex, between, males, and, hiv, being, downplayed, policies, and, attitudes, toward, gay, and, lesbian, military, personnel, vary, widely, around, the, world, some, countries, allow, gay, men, lesbians, and, bisexual, people, to, serve, openly, and, have, granted, them, the, same, rights, and, privileges, as, their, heterosexual, counterparts, many, countries, neither, ban, nor, support, lgb, service, members, a, few, countries, continue, to, ban, homosexual, personnel, outright, most, western, military, forces, have, removed, policies, excluding, sexual, minority, members, of, the, 26, countries, that, participate, militarily, in, nato, more, than, 20, permit,

association, empirical, evidence, fails, to, show, that, sexual, orientation, is, germane, to, any, aspect, of, military, effectiveness, including, unit, cohesion, morale, recruitment, and, retention, sexual, orientation, is, irrelevant, to, task, cohesion, the, only, type, of, cohesion, that, critically, predicts, the, team, s, military, readiness, and, success, societal, acceptance, of, non, heterosexual, orientations, such, as, homosexuality, is, lowest, in, asian, african, and, eastern, european, countries, and, is, highest, in, western, europe, australia, and, the, americas, western, society, has, become, increasingly, accepting, of, homosexuality, since, the, 1990s, in, 2017, professor, amy, adamczyk, contended, that, these, cross, national, differences, in, acceptance, can, be, largely, explained, by, three, factors, the, relative, strength, of, democratic, institutions, the, level, of, economic, development, and, the, religious, context, of, the, places, where, people, live, non, acceptance, of, the, sexual, identity, of, lgbtq, by, the, official, laws, of, some, countries, as, well, as, the, lack, of, teaching, correct, behavior, towards, homosexuals, has, led, to, the, formation, of, societal, misconceptions, about, this, group, these, stereotypical, beliefs, of, the, people, against, the, lgbtq, community, have, caused, rejection, and, discriminatory, behavior, against, them, various, researches, have, shown, that, lgbtq, people, in, societies, that, do, not, recognize, homosexuality, as, a, sexual, identity, of, such, group, feel, insecure, psychological, pressure, and, isolated, from, the, society, kameel, ahmady, an, anthropologist, and, social, researcher, who, along, with, team, conducted, a, fieldwork, study, in, iran, with, the, aim, of, understanding, the, attitude, of, the, iranian, lgbtq, community, towards, their, position, in, the, iranian, society, believes, that, the, traditional, and, religious, structure, of, the, society, along, with, the, legal, obstacles, and, restrictions, has, caused, this, groups, to, not, to, be, able, to, express, themselves, and, often, suppressing, their, gender, identity, legal, restrictions, such, as, imprisonment, fear, of, execution, not, been, to, allowed, employment, in, governmental, jobs, along, with, informal, restrictions, such, as, sexual, abuse, in, society, exclusion, from, family, and, social, groups, verbal, and, public, humiliation, etc, have, all, made, life, difficult, for, the, lgbtq, groups, in, a, 2024, study, published, by, springer, nature, the, austrian, political, scientist, arno, tausch, found, that, homonegativity, is, not, only, a, matter, of, growing, scientific, interest, in, the, global, social, science, community, but, also, of, growing, concern, for, public, safety, and, political, stability, around, the, world, extremist, groups, from, the, far, right, to, radical, islamists, are, increasingly, targeting, lgbtq, people, the, study, included, up, to, 88, countries, and, territories, around, the, world, using, open, data, from, the, world, values, survey, and, examining, the, relationship, between, homonegativity, and, religiously, motivated, political, extremism, the, estimates, of, global, homonegativity, based, on, rates, of, disapproval, of, homosexual, neighbours, covered, more, than, 90, per, cent, of, the, world, s, population, and, yielded, the, population, weighted, result, of, a, global, percentage, of, homonegativity, of, around, 55, per, cent, according, to, the, data, of, the, study, 12, 8, of, the, global, population, not, only, oppose, gay, neighbours, but, also, strongly, believe, that, it, is, an, essential, feature, of, democracy, that, religious, authorities, must, interpret, the, laws, 1, 2, of, the, world, s, population, are, not, only, such, religiously, fundamentalist, homophobes, but, also, strongly, believe, that, political, violence, is, justified, this, is, the, hard, core, of, the, 1, 2, of, the, global, population, who, can, be, expected, to, be, at, the, forefront, of, future, violent, and, religiously, motivated, political, action, against, lgbtq, communities, the, study, also, estimates, that, ten, countries, present, the, highest, potential, for, such, homophobic, political, violence, philippines, malaysia, kenya, ecuador, zimbabwe, canada, spain, nicaragua, mexico, and, iraq, the, study, suggests, that, threats, to, the, well, being, of, lgbtq, communities, come, not, only, from, islamist, radicalism, but, also, from, increasingly, militant, orthodox, propaganda, against, lgbtqs, in, the, context, of, the, current, war, in, ukraine, in, 2006, the, american, psychological, association, american, psychiatric, association, and, national, association, of, social, workers, stated, in, an, amicus, brief, presented, to, the, supreme, court, of, california, gay, men, and, lesbians, form, stable, committed, relationships, that, are, equivalent, to, heterosexual, relationships, in, essential, respects, the, institution, of, marriage, offers, social, psychological, and, health, benefits, that, are, denied, to, same, sex, couples, by, denying, same, sex, couples, the, right, to, marry, the, state, reinforces, and, perpetuates, the, stigma, historically, associated, with, homosexuality, homosexuality, remains, stigmatized, and, this, stigma, has, negative, consequences, california, s, prohibition, on, marriage, for, same, sex, couples, reflects, and, reinforces, this, stigma, they, concluded, there, is, no, scientific, basis, for, distinguishing, between, same, sex, couples, and, heterosexual, couples, with, respect, to, the, legal, rights, obligations, benefits, and, burdens, conferred, by, civil, marriage, though, the, relationship, between, homosexuality, and, religion, is, complex, current, authoritative, bodies, and, doctrines, of, the, world, s, largest, religions, view, homosexual, behaviour, negatively, this, can, range, from, quietly, discouraging, homosexual, activity, to, explicitly, forbidding, same, sex, sexual, practices, among, adherents, and, actively, opposing, social, acceptance, of, homosexuality, some, teach, that, homosexual, desire, itself, is, sinful, others, state, that, only, the, sexual, act, is, a, sin, while, others, are, completely, accepting, of, gays, and, lesbians,

homophobia, and, heterosexism, negative, attitudes, bias, and, discrimination, in, favor, of, opposite, sex, sexuality, and, relationships, heterosexism, can, include, the, presumption, that, everyone, is, heterosexual, or, that, opposite, sex, attractions, and, relationships, are, the, norm, and, therefore, superior, homophobia, is, a, fear, of, aversion, to, or, discrimination, against,

courtship, affection, pair, bonding, and, parenting, and, are, widespread, a, 1999, review, by, researcher, bruce, bagemihl, shows, that, homosexual, behavior, has, been, documented, in, about, 500, species, ranging, from, primates, to, gut, worms, animal, sexual, behavior, takes, many, different, forms, even, within, the, same, species, the, motivations, for, and, implications, of, these,
