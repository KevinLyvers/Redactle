pass, or, dribble, the, ball, taking, more, than, three, steps, at, any, time, is, considered, travelling, and, results, in, a, turnover, a, player, may, dribble, as, many, times, as, they, want, though, since, passing, is, faster, it, is, the, preferred, method, of, attack, as, long, as, during, each, dribble, the, hand, contacts, only, the, top, of, the, ball, therefore, carrying, is, completely, prohibited, and, results, in, a, turnover, after, the, dribble, is, picked, up, the, player, has, the, right, to, another, three, seconds, or, three, steps, the, ball, must, then, be, passed, or, shot, as, further, holding, or, dribbling, will, result, in, a, double, dribble, turnover, and, a, free, throw, for, the, other, team, other, offensive, infractions, that, result, in, a,

subject, to, the, same, restrictions, as, the, court, players, the, goalkeepers, may, participate, in, the, normal, play, of, their, teammates, a, regular, court, player, may, substitute, for, the, goalkeeper, if, a, team, elects, to, use, this, scheme, in, order, to, outnumber, the, defending, players, prior, to, 2015, this, court, player, became, the, designated, goalkeeper, on, the, court, and, had, to, wear, some, vest, or, bib, the, same, color, as, the, goalkeeper, s, shirt, to, be, identified, as, such, a, rule, change, meant, to, make, the, game, more, offensive, now, allows, any, player, to, substitute, for, the, goalkeeper, without, becoming, a, designated, goalkeeper, the, new, rule, resembles, the, one, used, in, ice, hockey, this, rule, was, first, used, in, the, women, s, world, championship, in, december, 2015, and, has, since, been, used, by, the, men, s, european, championship, in, january, 2016, and, by, both, genders, in, the, olympic, tournament, in, 2016, this, rule, change, has, led, to, a, drastic, increase, of, empty, net, goals, if, either, goalkeeper, deflects, the, ball, over, the, outer, goal, line, their, team, stays, in, possession, of, the, ball, in, contrast, to, other, sports, like, football, the, goalkeeper, resumes, the, play, with, a, throw, from, within, the, zone, goalkeeper, throw, in, a, penalty, shot, or, directly, taken, free, throw, throwing, the, ball, against, the, head, of, a, goalkeeper, who, is, not, moving, will, lead, to, a, direct, disqualification, red, card, hitting, a, non, moving, goalkeeper, s, head, out, of, regular, play, will, lead, to, a, two, minute, suspension, as, long, as, the, player, threw, without, obstruction, outside, of, own, d, zone, the, goalkeeper, is, treated, as, an, ordinary, court, player, and, has, to, follow, court, players, rules, holding, or, tackling, an, opponent, player, outside, the, area, risks, a, direct, disqualification, the, goalkeeper, may, not, return, to, the,

extensions, of, the, second, half, other, officials, typically, include, physicians, or, managers, no, official, is, allowed, to, enter, the, playing, court, without, the, permission, of, the, referees, the, ball, is, spherical, and, must, be, made, either, of, leather, or, a, synthetic, material, it, is, not, allowed, to, have, a, shiny, or, slippery, surface, as, the, ball, is, intended, to, be, operated, by, a, single, hand, its, official, sizes, vary, depending, on, age, and, gender, of, the, participating, teams, the, referees, may, award, a, special, throw, to, a, team, this, usually, happens, after, certain, events, such, as, scored, goals, off, court, balls, turnovers, and, timeouts, all, of, these, special, throws, require, the, thrower, to, obtain, a, certain, position, and, pose, restrictions, on, the, positions, of, all, other, players, sometimes, the, execution, must, wait, for, a, whistle, blow, by, the, referee, penalties, are, given, to, players, in, progressive, format, for, fouls, that, require, more, punishment, than, just, a, free, throw, actions, directed, mainly, at, the, opponent, and, not, the, ball, such, as, reaching, around, holding, pushing, tripping, and, jumping, into, opponent, as, well, as, contact, from, the, side, from, behind, a, player, or, impeding, the, opponent, s, counterattack, are, all, considered, illegal, and, are, subject, to, penalty, any, infraction, that, prevents, a, clear, scoring, opportunity, will, result, in, a, seven, metre, penalty, shot, typically, the, referee, will, give, a, warning, yellow, card, for, an, illegal, action, but, if, the, contact, was, particularly, dangerous, like, striking, the, opponent, in, the, head, neck, or, throat, the, referee, can, forego, the, warning, for, an, immediate, two, minute, suspension, players, are, warned, once, before, given, a, yellow, card, they, risk, being, red, carded, if, they, receive, three, two, minute, suspensions, a, red, card, results, in, an, ejection, from, the, game, and, a, two, minute, penalty, for, the, team, a, player, may, receive, a, red, card, directly, for, particularly, rough, penalties, for, instance, any, contact, from, behind, during, a, fast, break, is, now, being, treated, with, a, red, card, as, does, any, deliberate, intent, to, injure, opponents, a, red, carded, player, has, to, leave, the, playing, area, completely, a, player, who, is, disqualified, may, be, substituted, with, another, player, after, the, two, minute, penalty, is, served, a, coach, or, official, can, also, be, penalized, progressively, any, coach, or, official, who, receives, a, two, minute, suspension, will, have, to, pull, out, one, of, their, players, for, two, minutes, however, the, player, is, not, the, one, punished, and, can, be, substituted, in, again, as, the, penalty, consists, of, the, team, playing, with, one, fewer, player, than, the, opposing, team, after, referees, award, the, ball, to, the, opponents, for, whatever, reason, the, player, currently, in, possession, of, the, ball, has, to, lay, it, down, quickly, or, risk, a, two, minute, suspension, also, gesticulating, or, verbally, questioning, the, referee, s, order, as, well, as, arguing, with, the, officials, decisions, will, normally, risk, a, yellow, card, if, the, suspended, player, protests, further, does, not, walk, straight, off, the, court, to, the, bench, or, if, the, referee, deems, the, tempo, deliberately, slow, that, player, risks, a, double, yellow, card, illegal, substitution, outside, of, the, dedicated, area, or, if, the, replacement, player, enters, too, early, is, prohibited, if, they, do, they, risk, a, yellow, card, players, are, typically, referred, to, by, the, positions, they, are, playing, the, positions, are, always, denoted, from, the, view, of, the, respective, goalkeeper, so, that, a, defender, on, the, right, opposes, an, attacker, on, the, left, however, not, all, of, the, following, positions, may, be, occupied, depending, on, the, formation, or, potential, suspensions, sometimes, the, offense, uses, formations, with, two, pivot, players, there, are, many, variations, in, defensive, formations, usually, they, are, described, as, n, m, formations, where, n, is, the, number, of, players, defending, at, the, goal, line, and, m, the, number, of, players, defending, more, offensive, exceptions, are, the, 3, 2, 1, defense, and, n, m, formation, e, g, 5, 1, where, m, players, defend, some, offensive, player, in, man, coverage, instead, of, the, usual, zone, coverage, attacks, are, played, with, all, court, players, on, the, side, of, the, defenders, depending, on, the, speed, of, the, attack, one, distinguishes, between, three, attack, waves, with, a, decreasing, chance, of, success, the, third, wave, evolves, into, the, normal, offensive, play, when, all, defenders, not, only, reach, the, zone, but, gain, their, accustomed, positions, some, teams, then, substitute, specialised, offence, players, however, this, implies, that, these, players, must, play, in, the, defence, should, the, opposing, team, be, able, to, switch, quickly, to, offence, the, latter, is, another, benefit, for, fast, playing, teams, if, the, attacking, team, does, not, make, sufficient, progress, eventually, releasing, a, shot, on, goal, the, referees, can, call, passive, play, since, 1995, the, referee, gives, an, advance, warning, by, holding, one, hand, high, signalling, that, the, attacking, team, should, release, a, shot, soon, turning, control, over, to, the, other, team, a, shot, on, goal, or, an, infringement, leading, to, a, yellow, card, or, two, minute, penalty, will, mark, the, start, of, a, new, attack, causing, the, hand, to, be, taken, down, but, a, shot, blocked, by, the, defense, or, a, normal, free, throw, will, not, this, rule, prevents, an, attacking, team, from, stalling, the, game, indefinitely, as, it, is, difficult,
