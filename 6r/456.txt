towards, the, area, they, are, fleeing, and, using, this, technique, they, capture, them, and, as, i, have, said, few, because, there, are, also, tamed, horses, called, corraliegos, in, great, quantity, that, there, are, many, who, have, more, than, a, thousand, mares, and, the, ones, who, seem, to, have, the, least, have, five, hundred, or, two, hundred, and, that, is, nothing, because, there, is, so, much, cattle, that, there, are, men, who, have, 150, 000, cows, and, having, 20, 000, is, very, little, and, many, are, cimarronas, and, most, are, rodeo, ones, that, are, so, made, to, it, it, is, the, only, way, to, know, how, many, there, are, and, these, rodeos, are, done, this, way, that, more, than, three, hundred, horsemen, of, all, the, cattle, barons, gather, on, a, specified, day, and, that, land, they, call, valles, is, very, flat, and, depopulated, of, towns, where, they, have, to, hunt, the, meek, cattle, especially, in, the, san, juan, valley, in, the, chichimecas, who, are, untamed, hostile, indians, who, have, never, been, conquered, and, they, do, a, lot, of, damage, both, in, killing, people, and, in, burning, the, houses, that, over, there, they, call, estancias, where, the, vaqueros, live, and, where, they, have, their, corrals, to, enclose, some, cattle, to, brand, the, term, was, also, used, to, refer, to, exhibitions, of, skills,

macapagal, arroyo, the, province, wide, festival, rodeo, masbate, o, was, first, organized, in, 1993, to, promote, masbate, s, cattle, industry, and, boost, its, tourism, protests, were, first, raised, regarding, rodeo, animal, cruelty, in, the, 1870s, and, beginning, in, the, 1930s, some, states, enacted, laws, curtailing, rodeo, activities, and, other, events, involving, animals, in, the, 1950s, the, then, rodeo, cowboys, association, rca, later, the, prca, worked, with, the, american, humane, association, aha, to, establish, regulations, protecting, the, welfare, of, rodeo, animals, that, were, acceptable, to, both, organizations, the, prca, realized, that, public, education, regarding, rodeo, and, the, welfare, of, animals, was, needed, to, keep, the, sport, alive, over, the, years, conditions, for, animals, in, rodeo, and, many, other, sporting, events, improved, today, the, prca, and, other, rodeo, sanctioning, organizations, have, stringent, regulations, to, ensure, rodeo, animals, welfare, for, example, these, rules, require, among, other, things, provisions, for, injured, animals, a, veterinarian, s, presence, at, all, rodeos, a, similar, requirement, exists, for, other, equine, events, padded, flank, straps, horn, protection, for, steers, and, spurs, with, dulled, free, spinning, rowels, rodeo, competitors, in, general, value, and, provide, excellent, care, to, the, animals, with, which, they, work, animals, must, also, be, protected, with, fleece, lined, flank, straps, for, bucking, stock, and, horn, wraps, for, roping, steers, laws, governing, rodeo, vary, widely, in, the, american, west, some, states, incorporate, the, regulations, of, the, prca, into, their, statutes, as, a, standard, by, which, to, evaluate, if, animal, cruelty, has, occurred, on, the, other, hand, some, events, and, practices, are, restricted, or, banned, in, other, states, including, california, rhode, island, and, ohio, 268, 269, st, petersburg, florida, is, the, only, locality, in, the, united, states, with, a, complete, ban, on, rodeo, 268, 269, canadian, humane, societies, are, careful, in, criticizing, canadian, rodeo, as, the, event, has, become, so, indigenous, to, western, canada, that, criticism, may, jeopardize, support, for, the, organization, s, other, humane, goals, the, calgary, humane, society, itself, is, wary, of, criticizing, the, famous, calgary, stampede, internationally, rodeo, itself, is, banned, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, netherlands, and, other, european, nations, have, placed, restrictions, on, certain, practices, however, a, number, of, humane, and, animal, rights, organizations, have, policy, statements, that, oppose, many, rodeo, practices, and, often, the, events, themselves, some, also, claim, that, regulations, vary, from, vague, to, ineffective, and, are, frequently, violated, other, groups, assert, that, any, regulation, still, allows, rodeo, animals, to, be, subjected, to, gratuitous, harm, for, the, sake, of, entertainment, and, therefore, rodeos, should, be, banned, altogether, in, response, to, these, concerns, a, number, of, cities, and, states, mostly, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, united, states, have, passed, ordinances, and, laws, governing, rodeo, pittsburgh, for, example, specifically, prohibits, electric, prods, or, shocking, devices, flank, or, bucking, straps, wire, tie, downs, and, sharpened, or, fixed, spurs, or, rowels, pittsburgh, also, requires, humane, officers, be, provided, access, to, any, and, all, areas, where, animals, may, go, specifically, pens, chutes, and, injury, pens, the, state, of, rhode, island, has, banned, tie, down, roping, and, certain, other, practices, other, locales, have, similar, ordinances, and, laws, there, are, three, basic, areas, of, concern, to, various, groups, the, first, set, of, concerns, surround, relatively, common, rodeo, practices, such, as, the, use, of, bucking, straps, also, known, as, flank, straps, the, use, of, metal, or, electric, cattle, prods, and, tail, twisting, the, second, set, of, concerns, surround, non, traditional, rodeo, events, that, operate, outside, the, rules, of, sanctioning, organizations, these, are, usually, amateur, events, such, as, mutton, busting, calf, dressing, wild, cow, milking, calf, riding, chuck, wagon, races, and, other, events, designed, primarily, for, publicity, half, time, entertainment, or, crowd, participation, finally, some, groups, consider, some, or, all, rodeo, events, themselves, to, be, cruel, groups, such, as, peta, and, shark, and, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, generally, take, a, position, of, opposition, to, all, rodeos, and, rodeo, events, a, more, general, position, is, taken, by, the, aspca, only, opposing, rodeo, events, that, involve, cruel, painful, stressful, and, potentially, harmful, treatment, of, livestock, not, only, in, performance, but, also, in, handling, transport, and, prodding, to, perform, the, group, singles, out, children, s, rodeo, events, such, as, goat, tying, calf, riding, and, sheep, riding, mutton, busting, which, do, not, promote, humane, care, and, respect, for, animals, the, american, humane, association, aha, does, not, appear, to, oppose, rodeos, per, se, though, they, have, a, general, position, on, events, and, contests, involving, animals, stating, that, when, animals, are, involved, in, entertainment, they, must, be, treated, humanely, at, all, times, the, aha, also, has, strict, requirements, for, the, treatment, of, animals, used, for, rodeo, scenes, in, movies, starting, with, the, rules, of, the, prca, and, adding, additional, requirements, consistent, with, the, association, s, other, policies, unique, among, animal, protection, groups, the, aspca, specifically, notes, that, practice, sessions, are, often, the, location, of, more, severe, abuses, than, competitions, however, many, state, animal, cruelty, laws, provide, specific, exemptions, for, training, practices, the, american, humane, association, is, the, only, organization, addressing, the, legislative, issue, advocating, the, strengthening, of, animal, cruelty, laws, in, general, with, no, exceptions, for, training, practices, it, is, a, myth, that, a, modern, bucking, horse, is, a, wild, animal, the, modern, bronc, is, not, a, truly, feral, horse, some, bucking, horses, are, riding, horses, that, learned, to, buck, off, their, riders, other, bucking, horses, are, specifically, bred, for, use, in, rodeos, a, proven, bucking, horse, can, be, sold, for, 8000, to, 10, 000, or, more, making, rough, stock, a, valuable, investment, worth, caring, for, and, keeping, in, good, health, for, many, years, likewise, bucking, bulls, are, also, selectively, bred, most, are, allowed, to, grow, up, in, a, natural, semi, wild, condition, on, the, open, range, but, also, have, to, be, trained, in, order, to, be, managed, from, the, ground, safely, loaded, into, trailers, vaccinated, and, wormed, and, be, loaded, in, and, out, of, bucking, chutes, young, bucking, horses, are, initially, introduced, to, work, with, cloth, dummies, attached, to, the, saddle, others, are, already, well, trained, on, the, ground, some, champion, bucking, horses, got, their, start, as, riding, horses, that, learned, how, to, quickly, and, effectively, unseat, riders, due, to, the, rigors, of, travel, and, the, short, bursts, of, high, intensity, work, required, most, horses, in, a, bucking, string, are, at, least, six, or, seven, years, old, before, they, are, used, extensively, and, are, expected, to, be, sound, performers, for, many, years, awards, are, given, to, the, owners, of, the, best, bucking, horses, who, are, respected, as, equine, athletes, and, perform, for, many, years, many, are, retired, to, pasture, at, the, end, of, their, careers, many, bucking, horses, understand, their, job, well, and, reduce, or, stop, their, bucking, even, while, still, wearing, a, flank, strap, as, soon, as, they, either, unseat, the, rider, or, hear, the, buzzer, modern, rodeos, in, the, united, states, are, closely, regulated, and, have, responded, to, accusations, of, animal, cruelty, by, instituting, a, number, of, rules, to, guide, how, rodeo, animals, are, to, be, managed, in, 1994, a, survey, of, 28, sanctioned, rodeos, was, conducted, by, on, site, independent, veterinarians, reviewing, 33, 991, animal, runs, the, injury, rate, was, documented, at, 16, animals, or, 0, 047, percent, less, than, five, hundredths, of, one, percent, or, one, in, 2000, animals, a, study, of, rodeo, animals, in, australia, found, a, similar, injury, rate, basic, injuries, occurred, at, a, rate, of, 0, 072, percent, or, one, in, 1405, with, injuries, requiring, veterinary, attention, at, 0, 036, percent, or, one, injury, in, every, 2810, times, the, animal, was, used, and, transport, yarding, and, competition, were, all, included, in, the, study, a, later, prca, survey, of, 60, 971, animal, performances, at, 198, rodeo, performances, and, 73, sections, of, slack, indicated, 27, animals, were, injured, again, approximately, five, hundredths, of, 1, percent, 0, 0004, nonetheless, accusation, of, cruelty, in, the, usa, persist, the, prca, acknowledges, that, they, only, sanction, about, 30, percent, of, all, rodeos, while, another, 50, percent, are, sanctioned, by, other, organizations, and, 20, percent, are, completely, unsanctioned, the, prca, opposes, the, general, concept, of, animal, rights, but, supports, animal, welfare, the, prca, takes, the, position, that, the, organization, does, this, and, even, goes, beyond, expectation, not, all, rodeos, are, governed, by, the, prca, however, though, organizations, governing, collegiate, and, high, school, rodeos, base, their, rules, on, those, of, the, prca, nonetheless, certain, amateur, and, backyard, rodeos, are, unregulated, and, do, not, follow, prca, rules, advocates, for, rodeo, state, that, sick, injured, hungry, or, severely, abused, animals, cannot, perform, well, in, a, given, event, rough, stock, must, be, healthy, and, well, fed, to, give, the, cowboy, a, powerful, and, challenging, ride, sufficient, to, obtain, a, high, score, the, bucking, strap, has, to, be, an, incentive, to, an, animal, that, already, wants, to, buck, off, a, rider, not, a, prod, or, the, animal, will, either, flee, the, pain, not, buck, quickly, sour, and, refuse, to, work, regardless, of, any, pain, that, might, be, inflicted, steers, and, roping, calves, will, not, break, from, the, chute, fast, enough, for, ropers, to, achieve, a, fast, time, if, they, are, lame, or, weak, and, because, of, size, and, weight, restrictions, for, each, event, they, are, not, generally, used, for, more, than, a, single, season, health, regulations, mandate, vaccinations, and, blood, testing, of, animals, crossing, state, lines, so, rodeo, stock, receives, routine, care, an, injured, animal, will, not, buck, well, and, hence, a, cowboy, cannot, obtain, a, high, score, for, his, ride, so, sick, or, injured, animals, are, not, run, through, the, chutes, but, instead, are, given, appropriate, veterinary, care, so, they, can, be, returned, to, their, usual, level, of, strength, and, power, prca, regulations, require, veterinarians, to, be, available, at, all, rodeos, to, treat, both, bucking, stock, and, other, animals, as, needed, the, prca, emphasizes, that, they, first, promulgated, rules, for, proper, and, humane, treatment, of, livestock, in, 1947, a, full, seven, years, before, the, founding, of, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, participants, are, fined, for, animal, abuse, and, a, study, of, 21, prca, rodeos, found, only, 15, animals, injured, in, 26, 584, performances, a, 0, 06, percent, rate, there, are, occasions, of, rule, violations, and, animal, mistreatment, at, sanctioned, rodeos, the, major, national, rodeos, are, also, under, the, most, intense, scrutiny, and, are, the, most, likely, to, rigorously, follow, the, rules, rodeos, not, subject, to, the, rules, of, the, prca, or, other, organizations, and, rodeos, outside, of, the, united, states, and, canada, where, animal, cruelty, laws, are, weaker, are, more, likely, to, be, the, sites, of, abusive, practices, the, largest, state, of, the, art, rodeos, are, professional, commercial, athletic, contests, held, in, climate, controlled, stadiums, with, broadcasting, by, various, television, networks, outside, of, the, rodeo, world, itself, there, is, disagreement, about, exactly, what, rodeo, is, professional, competitors, for, example, view, rodeo, as, a, sport, and, call, themselves, professional, athletes, while, also, using, the, title, of, cowboy, fans, view, rodeo, as, a, spectator, sport, with, animals, having, aspects, of, pageantry, and, theater, unlike, other, professional, sport, non, westerners, view, the, spectacle, as, a, quaint, but, exciting, remnant, of, the, wild, west, while, animal, rights, activists, view, rodeo, as, a, cruel, roman, circus, spectacle, or, an, americanized, bullfight, anthropologists, studying, the, sport, of, rodeo, and, the, culture, surrounding, it, have, commented, that, it, is, a, blend, of, both, performance, and, contest, and, that, rodeo, is, far, more, expressive, in, blending, both, these, aspects, than, attempting, to, stand, alone, on, one, or, the, other, rodeo, s, performance, level, permits, pageantry, and, ritual, which, serve, to, revitalize, the, spirit, of, the, old, west, while, its, contest, level, poses, a, man, animal, opposition, that, articulates, the, transformation, of, nature, and, dramatizes, and, perpetuates, the, conflict, between, the, wild, and, the, tame, on, its, deepest, level, rodeo, is, essentially, a, ritual, addressing, itself, to, the, dilemma, of, man, s, place, in, nature, rodeo, is, a, popular, topic, in, country, western, music, such, as, the, 1991, garth, brooks, hit, single, rodeo, and, has, also, been, featured, in, numerous, movies, television, programs, and, in, literature, rodeo, is, a, ballet, score, written, by, aaron, copland, in, 1942, and, choreographer, agnes, de, mille, s, ballet, rodeo, was, commissioned, by, the, ballet, russe, de, monte, carlo, in, 1942, with, the, copland, score, country, singer, chris, ledoux, competed, in, bareback, riding, and, wrote, many, of, his, songs, based, on, his, experiences, rodeo, has, also, been, featured, in, a, significant, number, of, films, and, some, focus, specifically, on, the, sport, including, 8, seconds, cowboy, up, the, longest, ride, the, rider, and, the, cowboy, way, the, texas, legislature, declared, rodeo, to, be, the, official, sport, of, texas, in, 1997, in, 2021, united, conservative, party, politician, muhammad, yaseen, proposed, making, american, rodeo, the, official, sport, of, alberta, but, the, legislation, did, not, to, pass, there, are, thousands, of, rodeos, held, worldwide, each, year
