and, cost, in, terms, of, scale, of, production, the, dominant, yarn, constructions, are, polyamides, nylons, and, polypropylene, with, an, estimated, 90, of, the, commercial, market, since, the, 20th, century, nylon, is, one, of, the, most, common, materials, for, the, construction, of, carpets, both, nylon, 6, and, nylon, 6, 6, are, used, nylon, can, be, dyed, topically, or, dyed, in, a, molten, state, solution, dying, nylon, can, be, printed, easily, and, has, excellent, wear, characteristics, due, to, nylon, s, excellent, wear, resistance, it, is, widely, used, in, industrial, and, commercial, carpeting, in, carpets, nylon, tends, to, stain, easily, due, to, the, presence, of, dye, sites, these, dye, sites, need, to, be, filled, in, order, to, give, nylon, carpet, any, type, of, stain, resistance, as, nylon, is, petroleum, based, it, varies, in, price, with, the, price, of, oil, polypropylene, a, polyolefin, stiffer, than, the, cheaper, polyethylene, is, used, to, produce, carpet, yarns, because, it, is, still, less, expensive, than, the, other, materials, used, for, carpets, it, is, difficult, to, dye, and, does, not, wear, as, well, as, wool, or, nylon, polypropylene, sometimes, referred, to, simply, as, olefin, is, commonly, used, to, construct, berber, carpets, large, looped, olefin, berber, carpets, are, usually, only, suited, for, light, domestic, use, and,

level, loop, carpets, have, very, small, loops, and, commercial, grade, cut, pile, styles, can, be, well, constructed, when, made, with, polypropylene, commercial, grade, styles, wear, very, well, making, them, very, suitable, for, areas, with, heavy, foot, traffic, such, as, offices, polypropylene, carpets, are, known, to, have, good, stain, resistance, but, not, against, oil, based, agents, if, a, stain, does, set, it, can, be, difficult, to, clean, commercial, grade, carpets, can, be, glued, directly, to, the, floor, or, installed, over, a, 1, 4, thick, 8, pound, density, padding, outdoor, grass, carpets, are, usually, made, from, polypropylene, wool, has, excellent, durability, can, be, dyed, easily, and, is, fairly, abundant, when, blended, with, synthetic, fibres, such, as, nylon, the, durability, of, wool, is, increased, blended, wool, yarns, are, extensively, used, in, production, of, modern, carpet, with, the, most, common, blend, being, 80, wool, to, 20, synthetic, fibre, giving, rise, to, the, term, 80, 20, wool, is, relatively, expensive, and, consequently, it, only, comprises, a, small, portion, of, the, market, the, polyester, known, as, pet, polyethylene, terephthalate, is, used, in, carpet, manufacturing, in, both, spun, and, filament, constructions, after, the, price, of, raw, materials, for, many, types, of, carpet, rose, in, the, early, 2000s, polyester, became, more, competitive, polyester, has, good, physical, properties, and, is, inherently, stain, resistant, because, it, is, hydrophobic, however, oil, based, stains, can, pose, a, problem, for, this, type, of, material, and, it, can, be, prone, to, soiling, similar, to, nylon, colour, can, be, added, after, production, or, it, can, be, infused, in, a, molten, state, solution, dyeing, polyester, has, the, disadvantage, that, it, tends, to, crush, or, mat, down, easily, it, is, typically, used, in, mid, to, low, priced, carpeting, another, polyester, ptt, polytrimethylene, terephthalate, also, called, sorona, or, 3gt, dupont, or, corterra, shell, is, a, variant, of, pet, lurgi, zimmer, ptt, was, first, patented, in, 1941, but, it, was, not, produced, until, the, 1990s, when, shell, chemicals, developed, the, low, cost, method, of, producing, high, quality, 1, 3, propanediol, pdo, the, starting, raw, material, for, ptt, corterra, polymers, dupont, subsequently, commercialized, a, biological, process, for, making, 1, 3, propanediol, from, corn, syrup, imparting, significant, renewable, content, on, the, corresponding, sorona, polyester, carpet, fibers, these, carpet, fibers, have, resiliency, comparable, to, nylon, acrylic, is, a, synthetic, material, first, created, by, the, dupont, corporation, in, 1941, but, has, gone, through, various, changes, since, it, was, first, introduced, in, the, past, acrylic, carpet, used, to, fuzz, or, pill, easily, this, happened, when, the, fibres, degraded, over, time, and, short, strands, broke, away, with, contact, or, friction, over, the, years, new, types, of, acrylics, have, been, developed, to, alleviate, some, of, these, problems, although, the, issues, have, not, been, completely, removed, acrylic, is, fairly, difficult, to, dye, but, is, colourfast, washable, and, has, the, feel, and, appearance, of, wool, making, it, a, good, rug, fabric, the, knotted, pile, carpet, probably, originated, in, the, caspian, sea, area, northern, iran, or, the, armenian, highland, although, there, is, evidence, of, goats, and, sheep, being, sheared, for, wool, and, hair, which, was, spun, and, woven, as, far, back, at, the, 7th, millennium, the, earliest, surviving, pile, carpet, is, the, pazyryk, carpet, which, dates, from, the, 5th, 4th, century, bc, it, was, excavated, by, sergei, ivanovich, rudenko, in, 1949, from, a, pazyryk, burial, mound, in, the, altai, mountains, in, siberia, this, richly, coloured, carpet, is, 200, cm, 183, cm, 6, ft, 7, in, 6, ft, 0, in, and, framed, by, a, border, of, griffins, although, claimed, by, many, cultures, this, square, tufted, carpet, almost, perfectly, intact, is, considered, by, many, experts, to, be, of, caucasian, specifically, armenian, origin, the, rug, is, woven, using, the, armenian, double, knot, and, the, red, filaments, color, was, made, from, armenian, cochineal, the, eminent, authority, of, ancient, carpets, ulrich, schurmann, says, of, it, from, all, the, evidence, available, i, am, convinced, that, the, pazyryk, rug, was, a, funeral, accessory, and, most, likely, a, masterpiece, of, armenian, workmanship, gantzhorn, concurs, with, this, thesis, at, the, ruins, of, persepolis, in, iran, where, various, nations, are, depicted, as, bearing, tribute, the, horse, design, from, the, pazyryk, carpet, is, the, same, as, the, relief, depicting, part, of, the, armenian, delegation, the, historian, herodotus, writing, in, the, 5th, century, bc, also, informs, us, that, the, inhabitants, of, the, caucasus, wove, beautiful, rugs, with, brilliant, colors, which, would, never, fade, there, has, recently, been, a, surge, in, demand, for, afghan, carpets, although, many, afghan, carpet, manufacturers, market, their, products,

industry, the, town, of, wilton, wiltshire, is, also, known, for, its, carpet, weaving, which, dates, back, to, the, 18th, century, the, brussels, loom, was, introduced, into, england, towards, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, and, marked, the, beginning, of, a, new, era, in, carpet, weaving, it, was, the, first, loom, on, which, a, pile, carpet, could, be, woven, mechanically, the, pile, consisting, of, rows, of, loops, formed, over, wires, inserted, weftwise, during, weaving, and, subsequently, withdrawn, brussels, was, the, first, type, of, carpet, to, be, woven, in, a, loom, incorporating, the, jacquard, pattern, selecting, mechanism, and, in, 1849, power, was, applied, to, the, loom, by, biglow, in, the, united, states, later, when, bladed, wires, were, developed, the, pile, loops, were, severed, on, withdrawal, of, the, wires, to, produce, a, carpet, known, as, wilton, and, after, this, development, the, loom, became, known, as, the, wilton, loom, in, modern, usage, the, designation, wilton, applies, to, both, cut, pile, and, loop, pile, carpets, made, in, this, loom, the, latter, are, now, variously, described, as, brussels, wilton, round, wire, wilton, loop, pile, wilton, and, round, wired, jacquard, the, methods, of, manufacture, including, the, principles, of, design, preparatory, processes, and, weaving, are, the, same, in, most, respects, for, both, brussels, and, wilton, qualities, the, chief, difference, between, them, is, that, whereas, brussels, loop, pile, is, secured, satisfactorily, by, the, insertion, of, two, picks, of, weft, to, each, wire, 2, shot, the, wilton, cut, pile, is, woven, more, often, with, three, picks, of, weft, to, each, wire, 3, shot, to, ensure, that, the, tufts, are, firmly, secured, in, the, carpet, backing, brussels, carpets, have, a, smooth, slightly, ribbed, surface, and, their, patterning, is, well, defined, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, carpet, closeness, of, pile, rather, than,
