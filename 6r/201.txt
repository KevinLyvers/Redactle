in, denominations, of, christianity, a, godparent, or, sponsor, is, someone, who, bears, witness, to, a, child, s, baptism, christening, and, later, is, willing, to, help, in, their, catechesis, as, well, as, their, lifelong, spiritual, formation, in, the, past, in, some, countries, the, role, carried, some, legal, obligations, as, well, as, religious, responsibilities, in, both, religious, and, civil, views, a, godparent, tends, to, be, an, individual, chosen, by, the, parents, to, take, an, interest, in, the, child, s, upbringing, and, personal, development, to, offer, mentorship, or, claim, legal, guardianship, of, the, child, if, anything, should, happen, to, the, parents, a, male, godparent, is, a, godfather, and, a, female, godparent, is, a, godmother, the, child, is, a, godchild, i, e, godson, for, boys, and, goddaughter, for, girls, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, ad, infant, baptism, had, begun, to, gain, acceptance, among, catholic, christians, for, the, spiritual, purification, and, social, initiation, of, infants, normally, these, sponsors, were, the, birth, parents, of, a, child, as, emphasized, in, 408, by, st, augustine, who, suggested, that, the, sponsors, could, be, other, individuals, in, exceptional, circumstances, within, a, century, the, corpus, juris, civilis, indicates, that, parents, had, been, replaced, in, this, role, almost, completely, by, those, who, were, not, the, child, s, birth, parents, this, was, clarified, in, 813, when, the, synod, of, mainz, prohibited, natural, parents, from, acting, as, godparents, to, their, own, children, by, the, 5th, century, male, sponsors, were, referred, to, as, spiritual, fathers, and, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, they, were, being, referred, to, as, compaters, and, commaters, suggesting, that, these, were, being, seen, as, spiritual, co, parents, around, the, same, time, laws, intended, to, prevent, marriage, between, family, members, were, extended, to, include, marriage, between, god, parents, and, children, a, decree, of, justinian, dated, to, 530, outlawed, marriage, between, a, godfather, and, his, goddaughter, and, these, barriers, continued, to, multiply, until, the, 11th, century, forbidding, marriage, between, natural, and, spiritual, parents, or, those, directly, related, to, them, as, confirmation, emerged, as, a, separate, rite, from, baptism, from, the, 8th, century, a, second, set, of, sponsors, with, similar, prohibitions, also, emerged, the, exact, extent, of, these, spiritual, relationships, as, a, bar, to, marriage, in, catholicism, was, unclear, until, the, council, of, trent, which, limited, it, to, relationships, between, the, godparents, the, child, and, the, parents, luther, zwingli, and, calvin, preserved, infant, baptism, and, the, accompanying, baptismal, sponsors, in, their, respective, protestant, denominations, despite, opposition, from, more, radical, reformers, such, as, anabaptists, their, respective, visions, of, the, role, played, by, godparents, differed, from, mainstream, catholicism, luther, was, opposed, to, the, prohibition, of, marriage, between, god, parents, and, children, zwingli, placed, more, emphasis, on, the, role, played, by, the, parents, and, pastors, and, calvin, preferred, the, birth, parents, serving, as, sponsors, among, french, calvinists, and, the, residents, of, geneva, it, became, the, norm, to, have, one, godparent, other, calvinists, most, notably, in, scotland, and, the, english, colonies, in, america, did, away, with, them, entirely, the, customary, obligation, of, godfathers, for, catholics, at, least, in, scotland, was, stated, in, nicol, burne, s, of, the, praying, in, latine, 1581, in, relation, to, latin, public, prayers, in, church, if, any, man, pray, in, any, other, tongue, i, e, than, his, own, it, is, also, expedient, that, he, understand, the, meaning, of, the, words, at, the, least, for, the, which, cause, in, the, catholic, church, the, parents, or, godfathers, are, obliged, to, learn, them, i, e, to, make, sure, they, have, learned, whom, they, held, in, baptism, the, forms, of, prayers, and, belief, and, instruct, them, sufficiently, therein, so, that, they, understand, the, same, in, the, early, church, one, sponsor, seems, to, have, been, the, norm, but, in, the, early, middle, ages, there, seems, to, have, been, two, one, of, each, sex, and, this, practice, has, been, largely, maintained, in, orthodox, christianity, in, 888, the, catholic, council, of, metz, attempted, to, limit, the, number, to, one, but, this, limit, seems, not, to, have, been, observed, in, early, 14th, century, spain, as, many, as, 20, godparents, were, being, chosen, for, a, single, child, in, england, the, synod, of, worcester, 1240, stipulated, three, sponsors, two, of, the, same, sex, and, one, of, the, opposite, and, this, has, remained, the, norm, in, the, church, of, england, the, council, of, trent, attempted, to, limit, the, numbers, of, godparents, to, one, or, two, but, practice, has, differed, across, the, catholic, world, the, church, of, england, the, mother, church, of, the, anglican, communion, retained, godparents, in, baptism, formally, removing, the, marriage, barriers, in, 1540, but, the, issue, of, the, role, and, status, of, godparents, continued, to, be, debated, in, the, english, church, they, were, abolished, in, 1644, by, the, directory, of, public, worship, promulgated, by, the, english, civil, war, parliamentary, regime, but, continued, to, be, used, in, some, parishes, in, the, north, of, england, after, the, restoration, in, 1660, they, were, reintroduced, to, anglicanism, with, occasional, objections, but, dropped, by, almost, every, dissenting, church, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, restored, institution, had, lost, some, of, its, social, importance, as, well, as, its, universality, at, present, in, the, church, of, england, relatives, can, stand, as, godparents, and, although, it, is, not, clear, that, parents, can, be, godparents, they, sometimes, are, godparents, should, be, both, baptised, and, confirmed, although, it, is, not, clear, in, which, church, but, the, requirement, for, confirmation, can, be, waived, there, is, no, requirement, for, clergy, to, baptise, those, from, outside, their, parishes, and, baptism, can, be, reasonably, delayed, so, that, the, conditions, including, suitable, godparents, can, be, met, as, a, result, individual, clergy, have, considerable, discretion, over, the, qualifications, of, godparents, many, contemporary, anglican, rites, likewise, require, parents, and, godparents, to, respond, on, behalf, of, infant, candidates, lutherans, follow, a, similar, theology, of, godparents, as, catholics, they, believe, that, godparents, help, with, their, christian, upbringing, especially, if, they, should, lose, their, parents, lutherans, like, catholics, believe, that, a, godparent, must, be, both, a, baptized, and, confirmed, christian, some, lutherans, also, follow, the, catholic, tradition, that, a, christian, who, is, not, affiliated, with, the, lutheran, denomination, may, serve, as, a, witness, rather, than, a, godparent, the, book, of, discipline, stipulates, that, it, is, the, duty, of, a, godparent, also, known, as, a, sponsor, to, provide, training, for, the, children, of, the, church, throughout, their, childhood, that, will, lead, to, a, personal, commitment, to, jesus, christ, as, lord, and, savior, to, an, understanding, of, the, christian, faith, and, to, an, appreciation, of, the, privileges, and, obligations, of, baptism, and, membership, 225, 4, john, wesley, the, founder, of, the, methodist, church, wrote, a, homily, titled, serious, thoughts, concerning, godfathers, and, godmothers, in, which, he, stated, that, godparents, are, spiritual, parents, to, the, baptized, whether, they, were, infants, or, and, were, expected, to, supply, whatever, spiritual, helps, were, wanting, either, through, the, death, or, neglect, of, the, natural, parents, he, described, the, role, of, godparents, instructing, that, they, should, call, upon, their, godchild, to, hear, sermons, and, shall, provide, that, he, she, may, learn, the, creed, the, lord, s, prayer, and, the, ten, commandments, and, all, other, things, which, a, christian, ought, to, know, and, believe, to, his, soul, s, health, and, that, this, child, be, virtuously, brought, up, to, lead, a, godly, and, a, christian, life, as, such, the, book, of, worship, states, that, godparents, sponsors, should, be, selected, carefully, and, should, be, members, of, christ, s, holy, church, and, it, is, the, duty, of, pastors, to, instruct, them, concerning, the, significance, of, holy, baptism, their, responsibilities, for, the, christian, training, of, the, baptized, child, and, how, these, obligations, may, be, fulfilled, the, orthodox, institution, of, godparenthood,

of, the, meaning, and, responsibilities, of, their, role, in, the, reformed, tradition, that, includes, the, continental, reformed, congregationalist, and, presbyterian, churches, the, godparents, are, more, often, referred, to, as, sponsors, who, have, the, role, of, standing, with, the, child, during, infant, baptism, and, pledging, to, instruct, the, child, in, the, faith, in, the,

during, forty, seven, baptisms, the, reformed, church, in, geneva, in, order, to, ensure, confessional, orthodoxy, expected, parents, to, select, reformed, godparents, today, many, reformed, churches, invite, parents, to, select, godparents, for, their, prospective, neophyte, while, other, parishes, entrust, this, responsibility, to, the, whole, congregation, the, catholic, institution, of,

received, the, eucharist, not, under, any, canonical, penalty, and, may, not, be, the, parent, of, the, child, someone, who, belongs, to, another, christian, church, cannot, become, a, godparent, but, can, be, a, witness, in, conjunction, with, a, catholic, sponsor, a, witness, does, not, have, any, religious, role, recognized, by, the, church, in, 2015, the, vatican, declared, that, transgender, catholics, cannot, become, godparents, stating, in, response, to, a, transgender, man, s, query, that, transgender, status, reveals, in, a, public, way, an, attitude, opposite, to, the, moral, imperative, of, solving, the, problem, of, sexual, identity, according, to, the, truth, of, one, s, own, sexuality, and, that, herefore, it, is, evident, that, this, person, does, not, possess, the, requirement, of, leading, a, life, according, to, the, faith, and, in, the, position, of, godfather, and, is, therefore, unable, to, be, admitted, to, the, position, of, godfather, or, godmother, in, some, catholic, and, orthodox, countries, particularly, in, southern, europe, latin, america, and, the, philippines, the, relationship, between, parents, and, godparents, or, co, godparents, has,
