used, as, a, mechanism, for, science, communication, some, games, such, as, chess, depend, completely, on, player, skill, while, many, children, s, games, such, as, candy, land, and, snakes, and, ladders, require, no, decisions, by, the, players, and, are, decided, purely, by, luck, many, games, require, some, level, of, both, skill, and, luck, a, player, may, be, hampered, by, bad, luck, in, backgammon, monopoly, or, risk, but, over, many, games, a, skilled, player, will, win, more, often, the, elements, of, luck, can, also, make, for, more, excitement, at, times, and, allow, for, more, diverse, and, multifaceted, strategies, as, concepts, such, as, expected, value, and, risk, management, must, be, considered, luck, may, be, introduced, into, a, game, by, several, methods, the, use, of, dice, of, various, sorts, goes, back, to, the, earliest, board, games, these, can, decide, everything, from, how, many, steps, a, player, moves, their, token, as, in, monopoly, to, how, their, forces, fare, in, battle, as, in, risk, or, which, resources, a, player, gains, as, in, catan, other, games, such, as, sorry, use, a, deck, of, special, cards, that, when, shuffled, create, randomness, scrabble, does, something, similar, with, randomly, picked, letters, other, games, use, spinners, timers, of, random, length, or, other, sources, of, randomness, german, style, board, games, are, notable, for, often, having, fewer, elements, of, luck, than, many, north, american, board, games, luck, may, be, reduced, in, favour, of, skill, by, introducing, symmetry, between, players, for, example, in, a, dice, game, such, as, ludo, by, giving, each, player, the, choice, of, rolling, the, dice, or, using, the, previous, player, s, roll, another, important, aspect, of, some, games, is, diplomacy, that, is, players, making, deals, with, one, another, negotiation, generally, features, only, in, games, with, three, or, more, players, cooperative, games, being, the, exception, an, important, facet, of, catan, for, example, is, convincing, players, to, trade, with, you, rather, than, with, opponents, in, risk, two, or, more, players, may, team, up, against, others, easy, diplomacy, involves, convincing, other, players, that, someone, else, is, winning, and, should, therefore, be, teamed, up, against, advanced, diplomacy, e, g, in, the, aptly, named, game, diplomacy, consists, of, making, elaborate, plans, together, with, the, possibility, of, betrayal, in, perfect, information, games, such, as, chess, each, player, has, complete, information, on, the, state, of, the, game, but, in, other, games, such, as, tigris, and, euphrates, or, stratego, some, information, is, hidden, from, players, this, makes, finding, the, best, move, more, difficult, and, may, involve, estimating, probabilities, by, the, opponents, many, board, games, are, now, available, as, video, games, these, are, aptly, termed, digital, board, games, and, their, distinguishing, characteristic, compared, to, traditional, board, games, is, they, can, now, be, played, online, against, a, computer, or, other, players, some, websites, such, as, boardgamearena, com, yucata, de, etc, allow, play, in, real, time, and, immediately, show, the, opponents, moves, while, others, use, email, to, notify, the, players, after, each, move, the, internet, and, cheaper, home, printing, has, also, influenced, board, games, via, print, and, play, games, that, may, be, purchased, and, printed, some, games, use, external, media, such, as, audio, cassettes, or, dvds, in, accompaniment, to, the, game, there, are, also, virtual, tabletop, programs, that, allow, online, players, to, play, a, variety, of, existing, and, new, board, games, through, tools, needed, to, manipulate, the, game, board, but, do, not, necessarily, enforce, the, game, s, rules, leaving, this, up, to, the, players, there, are, generalized, programs, such, as, vassal, tabletop, simulator, and, tabletopia, that, can, be, used, to, play, any, board, or, card, game, while, programs, like, roll20, and, fantasy, grounds, are, more, specialized, for, role, playing, games, some, of, these, virtual, tabletops, have, worked, with, the, license, holders, to, allow, for, use, of, their, game, s, assets, within, the, program, for, example, fantasy, grounds, has, licenses, for, both, dungeons, dragons, and, pathfinder, materials, while, tabletop, simulator, allows, game, publishers, to, provide, paid, downloadable, content, for, their, games, however, as, these, games, offer, the, ability, to, add, in, the, content, through, user, modifications, there, are, also, unlicensed, uses, of, board, game, assets, available, through, these, programs, while, the, board, gaming, market, is, estimated, to, be, smaller, than, that, for, video, games, it, has, also, experienced, significant, growth, from, the, late, 1990s, a, 2012, article, in, the, guardian, described, board, games, as, making, a, comeback, other, expert, sources, suggest, that, board, games, never, went, away, and, that, board, games, have, remained, a, popular, leisure, activity, which, has, only, grown, over, time, another, from, 2014, gave, an, estimate, that, put, the, growth, of, the, board, game, market, at, between, 25, and, 40, annually, since, 2010, and, described, the, current, time, as, the, golden, era, for, board, games, the, rise, in, board, game, popularity, has, been, attributed, to, quality, improvement, more, elegant, mechanics, components, artwork, and, graphics, as, well, as, increased, availability, thanks, to, sales, through, the, internet, crowd, sourcing, for, board, games, is, a, large, facet, of, the, market, with, 233, million, raised, on, kickstarter, in, 2020, a, 1991, estimate, for, the, global, board, game, market, was, over, 1, 2, billion, a, 2001, estimate, for, the, united, states, board, games, and, puzzle, market, gave, a, value, of, under, 400, million, and, for, united, kingdom, of, about, 50, million, a, 2009, estimate, for, the, korean, market, was, put, at, 800, million, won, and, another, estimate, for, the, american, board, game, market, for, the, same, year, was, at, about, 800, million, a, 2011, estimate, for, the, chinese, board, game, market, was, at, over, 10, billion, yuan, a, 2013, estimate, put, the, size, of, the, german, toy, market, at, 2, 7, billion, euros, out, of, which, the, board, games, and, puzzle, market, is, worth, about, 375, million, euros, and, polish, markets, at, 2, billion, and, 280, million, zlotys, respectively, in, 2009, germany, was, considered, to, be, the, best, market, per, capita, with, the, highest, number, of, games, sold, per, individual, some, academics, such, as, erica, price, and, marco, arnaudo, have, differentiated, hobby, board, games, and, gamers, from, other, board, games, and, gamers, a, 2014, estimate, placed, the, u, s, and, canada, market, for, hobby, board, games, games, produced, for, a, gamer, market, at, only, 75, million, with, the, total, size, of, what, it, defined, as, the, hobby, game, market, the, market, for, those, games, regardless, of, whether, they, re, sold, in, the, hobby, channel, or, other, channels, at, over, 700, million, a, similar, 2015, estimate, suggested, a, hobby, game, market, value, of, almost, 900, million, a, dedicated, field, of, research, into, gaming, exists, known, as, game, studies, or, ludology, while, there, has, been, a, fair, amount, of, scientific, research, on, the, psychology, of, older, board, games, e, g, chess, go, mancala, less, has, been, done, on, contemporary, board, games, such, as, monopoly, scrabble, and, risk, and, especially, modern, board, games, such, as, catan, agricola, and, pandemic, much, research, has, been, carried, out, on, chess, partly, because, many, tournament, players, are, publicly, ranked, in, national, and, international, lists, which, makes, it, possible, to, compare, their, levels, of, expertise, the, works, of, adriaan, de, groot, william, chase, herbert, a, simon, and, fernand, gobet, have, established, that, knowledge, more, than, the, ability, to, anticipate, moves, plays, an, essential, role, in, chess, playing, ability, linearly, arranged, board, games, have, improved, children, s, spatial, numerical, understanding, this, is, because, the, game, is, similar, to, a, number, line, in, that, they, promote, a, linear, understanding, of, numbers, rather, than, the, innate, logarithmic, one, research, studies, show, that, board, games, such, as, snakes, and, ladders, result, in, children, showing, significant, improvements, in, aspects, of, basic, number, skills, such, as, counting, recognizing, numbers, numerical, estimation, and, number, comprehension, they, also, practice, fine, motor, skills, each, time, they, grasp, a, game, piece, playing, board, games, has, also, been, tied, to, improving, children, s, executive, functions, and, help, reduce, risks, of, dementia, for, the, elderly, related, to, this, is, a, growing, academic, interest, in, the, topic, of, game, accessibility, culminating, in, the, development, of, guidelines, for, assessing, the, accessibility, of, modern, tabletop, games, and, the, extent, to, which, they, are, playable, for, people, with, disabilities, additionally, board, games, can, be, therapeutic, bruce, halpenny, a, games, inventor, said, when, interviewed, about, his, game, the, great, train, robbery, with, crime, you, deal, with, every, basic, human, emotion, and, also, have, enough, elements, to, combine, action, with, melodrama, the, player, s, imagination, is, fired, as, they, plan, to, rob, the, train, because, of, the, gamble, they, take, in, the, early, stage, of, the, game, there, is, a, build, up, of, tension, which, is, immediately, released, once, the, train, is, robbed, release, of, tension, is, therapeutic, and, useful, in, our, society, because, most, jobs, are, boring, and, repetitive, playing, games, has, been, suggested, as, a, viable, addition, to, the, traditional, educational, curriculum, if, the, content, is, appropriate, and, the, gameplay, informs, students, on, the, curriculum, content, there, are, several, ways, in, which, board, games, can, be, classified, and, considerable, overlap, may, exist, so, that, a, game, belongs, to, several, categories, the, namesake, of, the, board, game, gameboards, would, seem, to, be, a, necessary, and, sufficient, condition, of, the, genre, though, card, games, that, do, not, use, a, standard, deck, of, cards, as, well, as, games, that, use, neither, cards, nor, a, gameboard, are, often, colloquially, included, with, some, scholars, therefore, referring, to, said, genre, as, that, of, table, and, board, games, or, tabletop, games, or, seeing, board, games, as, a, subgenre, of, tabletop, games, 5, 1, h, j, r, murray, s, a, history, of, board, games, other, than, chess, 1952, has, been, called, the, first, attempt, to, develop, a, scheme, for, the, classification, of, board, games, david, parlett, s, oxford, history, of, board, games, 1999, defines, four, primary, categories, race, games, where, the, goal, is, to, be, the, first, to, move, all, one, s, pieces, to, the, final, destination, space, games, in, which, the, object, is, to, arrange, the, pieces, into, some, special, configuration, chase, games, asymmetrical, games, where, players, start, the, game, with, different, sets, of, pieces, and, objectives, and, displace, games, where, the, main, objective, is, the, capture, the, opponents, pieces, parlett, also, distinguishes, between, abstract, and, thematic, games, the, latter, having, a, specific, theme, or, frame, narrative, ex, regular, chess, versus, for, example, star, wars, themed, chess, the, following, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, most, common, game, categories, although, many, board, games, have, a, jargon, all, their, own, there, is, a, generalized, terminology, to, describe, concepts, applicable, to, basic, game, mechanics, and, attributes, common, to, nearly, all, board, games
