others, assert, that, the, idea, was, probably, derived, from, the, tent, which, remains, in, an, unaltered, form, to, the, present, day, however, the, tradition, existing, in, china, is, that, it, originated, in, standards, and, banners, waving, in, the, air, hence, the, use, of, the, umbrella, was, often, linked, to, high, ranking, though, not, necessarily, royalty, in, china, the, use, of,

bears, witness, to, a, transition, from, men, carrying, swords, then, spears, then, staffs, then, parasols, to, eventually, nothing, the, parasol, at, that, time, of, its, fashion, displayed, the,

inferiority, during, the, panathenaea, daughters, of, metics, carried, the, parasols, of, the, athenian, maidens, and, this, service, was, called, sciadephoria, from, greece, it, is, probable, that, the, use, of, the, parasol, passed, to, rome, where, it, seems, to, have, been, usually, used, by, women, while, it, was, the, custom, even, for, effeminate, men, to, defend, themselves, from, the, heat, by, means, of, the, umbraculum, formed, of, skin, or, leather, and, capable, of, being, lowered, at, will, there, are, frequent, references, to, the, umbrella, in, the, roman, classics, and, it, appears, that, it, was, not, unlikely, a, post, of, honour, among, maid, servants, to, bear, it, over, their, mistresses, allusions, to, it, are, tolerably, frequent, in, the, poets, ovid, fast, lib, ii, 1, 31, i, martial, lib, xi, ch, 73, lib, xiv, ch, 28, 130, ovid, ars, am, ii, 209, from, such, mentions, the, umbrella, seems, to, have, been, employed, as, a, defense, from, sun, but, references, to, its, use, as, a, protection, against, rain, while, rare, also, exist, juvenal, ix, 50, according, to, gorius, the, umbrella, came, to, rome, from, the, etruscans, who, came, to, rome, for, protection, and, certainly, it, appears, not, infrequently, on, etruscan, vases, and, pottery, as, also, on, later, gems, and, rubies, one, gem, figured, by, pacudius, shows, an, umbrella, with, a, bent, handle, sloping, backwards, strabo, describes, a, sort, of, screen, or, umbrella, worn, by, spanish, women, but, this, is, not, like, a, modern, umbrella, by, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, the, umbrella, and, parasol, were, largely, forgotten, in, europe, for, the, next, few, centuries, beginning, in, the, 8th, century, there, are, numerous, contemporary, depictions, and, descriptions, of, umbrellas, and, parasols, during, the, remainder, of, the, middle, ages, predominantly, used, in, the, religious, ceremonies, of, the, church, by, the, 8th, century, the, umbrella, and, parasol, was, firmly, established, in, the, church, seen, as, honorific, and, symbolic, the, earliest, visual, record, is, an, 8th, century, image, of, bishop, john, of, pavia, showing, him, followed, by, a, servant, carrying, an, umbrella, the, earliest, known, written, evidence, of, the, parasol, is, also, from, the, 8th, century, when, pope, paul, i, 757, 767, bestowed, a, jeweled, parasol, to, pepin, the, short, as, part, of, a, peace, settlement, a, 1530, depiction, is, in, girolamo, dai, libri, s, painting, madonna, dell, ombrello, madonna, of, the,

thomas, wright, in, his, domestic, manners, of, the, english, gives, a, drawing, from, the, harleian, ms, no, 604, which, represents, an, anglo, saxon, gentleman, walking, out, attended, by, his, servant, the, servant, carrying, an, umbrella, with, a, handle, that, slopes, backwards, so, as, to, bring, the, umbrella, over, the, head, of, the, person, in, front, it, probably, could, not, be, closed, but, otherwise, it, looks, like, an, ordinary, umbrella, and, the, ribs, are, represented, distinctly, the, use, of, the, parasol, and, umbrella, in, france, and, england, was, adopted, probably, from, china, about, the, middle, of, the, seventeenth, century, at, that, period, pictorial, representations, of, it, are, frequently, found, some, of, which, exhibit, the, peculiar, broad, and, deep, canopy, belonging, to, the, large, parasol, of, the, chinese, government, officials, borne, by, native, attendants, john, evelyn, in, his, diary, for, 22, june, 1664, mentions, a,

ladies, use, but, much, larger, and, with, long, handles, strangely, carved, and, filled, with, chinese, characters, which, is, evidently, a, description, of, the, parasol, in, thomas, coryat, s, crudities, published, in, 1611, about, a, century, and, a, half, prior, to, the, general, introduction, of, the, umbrella, into, england, is, a, reference, to, a, custom, of, riders, in, italy, using, umbrellas, and, many, of, them, doe, carry, other, fine, things, of, a, far, greater, price, that, will, cost, at, the, least, a, duckat, which, they, commonly, call, in, the, italian, tongue,

of, a, little, cannopy, hooped, in, the, inside, with, divers, little, wooden, hoopes, that, extend, the, umbrella, in, a, pretty, large, compasse, they, are, used, especially, by, horsemen, who, carry, them, in, their, hands, when, they, ride, fastening, the, end, of, the, handle, upon, one, of, their, thighs, and, they, impart, so, large, a, shadow, unto, them, that, it, keepeth, the, heate,

scorching, sunne, and, hence, any, little, shadow, fanne, or, thing, wherewith, women, hide, their, faces, from, the, sunne, in, fynes, moryson, s, itinerary, 1617, is, a, similar, allusion, to, the, habit, of, carrying, umbrellas, in, hot, countries, to, auoide, the, beames, of, the, sunne, their, employment, says, the, author, is, dangerous, because, they, gather, the, heate, into, a, pyramidall, point, and, thence, cast, it, down, perpendicularly, upon, the, head, except, they, know, how, to, carry, them, for, auoyding, that, danger, during, streynsham, master, s, 1676, visit, to,

inventory, of, the, french, royal, court, in, 1763, mentioned, eleven, parasols, of, taffeta, in, different, colours, as, well, as, three, parasols, of, waxed, toile, decorated, around, the, edges, with, lace, of, gold, and, silver, they, were, rare, and, the, word, parapluie, against, the, rain, did, not, enter, the, dictionary, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, until, 1718, kersey, s, dictionary, 1708, describes, an, umbrella, as, a, screen, commonly, used, by, women, to, keep, off, rain, the, first, lightweight, folding, umbrella, in, europe, was, introduced, in, 1710, by, a, paris, merchant, named, jean, marius, whose, shop, was, located, near, the, barrier, of, saint, honor, it, could, be, opened, and, closed, in, the, same, way, as, modern, umbrellas, and, weighed, less, than, one, kilogram, marius, received, from, the, king, the, exclusive, right, to, produce, folding, umbrellas, for, five, years, a, model, was, purchased, by, the, princess, palatine, in, 1712,

your, arm, for, six, months, in, order, to, use, it, perhaps, six, times, those, who, do, not, want, to, be, mistaken, for, vulgar, people, much, prefer, to, take, the, risk, of, being, soaked, rather, than, to, be, regarded, as, someone, who, goes, on, foot, an, umbrella, is, a, sure, sign, of, someone, who, doesn, t, have, his, own, carriage, in, 1769, the, maison, antoine, a, store, at,

the, use, of, the, umbrella, or, parasol, though, not, unknown, was, uncommon, in, england, during, the, earlier, half, of, the, eighteenth, century, as, is, evident, from, the, comment, made, by, general, then, lieut, colonel, james, wolfe, when, writing, from, paris, in, 1752, he, speaks, of, the, use, of, umbrellas, for, protection, from, the, sun, and, rain, and, wonders, why, a, similar,

present, portable, form, is, due, partly, to, the, substitution, of, silk, and, gingham, for, the, heavy, and, troublesome, oiled, silk, which, admitted, of, the, ribs, and, frames, being, made, much, lighter, and, also, to, many, ingenious, mechanical, improvements, in, the, framework, victorian, era, umbrellas, had, frames, of, wood, or, baleen, but, these, devices, were, expensive, and, hard, to, fold, when, wet, samuel, fox, invented, the, steel, ribbed, umbrella, in, 1852, however, the, encyclop, die, m, thodique, mentions, metal, ribs, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, and,
