roman, soldiers, were, stationed, the, oldest, representation, of, what, seems, to, be, a, man, facing, a, bull, is, on, the, celtiberian, tombstone, from, clunia, and, the, cave, painting, el, toro, de, hachos, both, found, in, spain, bullfighting, is, often, linked, to, rome, where, many, human, versus, animal, events, were, held, as, competition, and, entertainment, the, venationes, these, hunting, games, spread, to, africa, asia, and, europe, during, roman, times, there, are, also, theories, that, it, was, introduced, into, hispania, by, the, emperor, claudius, as, a, substitute, for, gladiators, when, he, instituted, a, short, lived, ban, on, gladiatorial, combat, the, latter, theory, was, supported, by, robert, graves, picadors, are, related, to, warriors, who, wielded, the, javelin, but, their, role, in, the, contest, is, now, a, minor, one, limited, to, preparing, the, bull, for, the, matador, spanish, colonists, took, the, practice, of, breeding, cattle, and, bullfighting, to, the, american, colonies, the, pacific, and, asia, in, the, 19th, century, areas, of, southern, and, southwestern, france, adopted, bullfighting, developing, their, distinctive, form, religious, festivities, and, royal, weddings, were, celebrated, by, fights, in, the, local, plaza, where, noblemen, would, ride, competing, for, royal, favor, and, the, populace, enjoyed, the, excitement, in, the, middle, ages, across, europe, knights, would, joust, in, competitions, on, horseback, in, spain, they, began, to, fight, bulls, in, medieval, spain, bullfighting, was, considered, a, noble, sport, and, reserved, for, the, rich, who, could, afford, to, supply, and, train, their, horses, the, bull, was, released, into, a, closed, arena, where, a, single, fighter, on, horseback, was, armed, with, a, lance, this, spectacle, was, said, to, be, enjoyed, by, charlemagne, alfonso, x, the, wise, and, the, almohad, caliphs, among, others, the, greatest, spanish, performer, of, this, art, is, said, to, have, been, the, knight, el, cid, according, to, a, chronicle, of, the, time, in, 1128, when, alfonso, vii, of, le, n, and, castile, married, berengaria, of, barcelona, daughter, of, ramon, berenguer, iii, count, of, barcelona, at, salda, a, among, other, celebrations, there, were, also, bullfights, in, the, time, of, emperor, charles, v, pedro, ponce, de, leon, was, the, most, famous, bullfighter, in, spain, and, a, renovator, of, the, technique, of, killing, the, bull, on, a, horse, with, blindfolded, eyes, juan, de, quir, s, the, best, sevillian, poet, of, that, time, dedicated, to, him, a, poem, in, latin, of, which, benito, arias, montano, transmits, some, verses, francisco, romero, from, ronda, spain, is, generally, regarded, as, having, been, the, first, to, introduce, the, practice, of, fighting, bulls, on, foot, around, 1726, using, the, muleta, in, the, last, stage, of, the, fight, and, an, estoc, to, kill, the, bull, this, type, of, fighting, drew, more, attention, from, the, crowds, thus, the, modern, corrida, or, fight, began, to, take, form, as, riding, noblemen, were, replaced, by, commoners, on, foot, this, new, style, prompted, the, construction, of, dedicated, bullrings, initially, square, like, the, plaza, de, armas, and, later, round, to, discourage, the, cornering, of, the, action, the, modern, style, of, spanish, bullfighting, is, credited, to, juan, belmonte, generally, considered, the, greatest, matador, of, all, time, belmonte, introduced, a, daring, and, revolutionary, style, in, which, he, stayed, within, a, few, centimeters, of, the, bull, throughout, the, fight, although, extremely, dangerous, belmonte, was, gored, on, many, occasions, his, style, is, still, seen, by, most, matadors, as, the, ideal, to, be, emulated, originally, at, least, five, distinct, regional, styles, of, bullfighting, were, practised, in, southwestern, europe, andalusia, aragon, navarre, alentejo, camargue, aquitaine, over, time, these, have, evolved, more, or, less, into, standardized, national, forms, mentioned, below, the, classic, style, of, bullfighting, in, which, the, rule, is, kill, the, bull, is, the, style, practiced, in, spain, and, many, latin, american, countries, bullfighting, stadia, are, named, bullrings, there, are, many, historic, bullrings, the, oldest, are, the, 1700s, spanish, plazas, of, sevilla, and, ronda, the, largest, bullring, is, the, plaza, m, xico, in, mexico, city, which, seats, 41, 000, people, spanish, style, bullfighting, is, called, corrida, de, toros, literally, coursing, of, bulls, or, la, fiesta, the, festival, in, the, traditional, corrida, three, matadores, each, fight, two, bulls, each, of, which, is, between, four, and, six, years, old, and, weighs, no, less, than, 460, kg, 1, 014, lb, each, matador, has, six, assistants, two, picadores, lancers, mounted, on, horseback, three, banderilleros, who, along, with, the, matadors, are, collectively, known, as, toreros, bullfighters, and, a, mozo, de, espadas, sword, page, collectively, they, comprise, a, cuadrilla, entourage, in, spanish, the, more, general, torero, or, diestro, literally, right, hander, is, used, for, the, lead, fighter, and, only, when, needed, to, distinguish, a, man, is, the, full, title, matador, de, toros, used, in, english, matador, is, generally, used, for, the, bullfighter, the, modern, corrida, is, highly, ritualized, with, three, distinct, stages, or, tercios, thirds, the, start, of, each, being, announced, by, a, bugle, sound, the, participants, enter, the, arena, in, a, parade, called, the, pase, llo, to, salute, the, presiding, dignitary, accompanied, by, band, music, torero, costumes, are, inspired, by, 17th, century, andalusian, clothing, and, matadores, are, easily, distinguished, by, the, gold, of, their, traje, de, luces, suit, of, lights, as, opposed, to, the, lesser, banderilleros, who, are, also, known, as, toreros, de, plata, bullfighters, of, silver, the, bull, is, released, into, the, ring, where, he, is, tested, for, ferocity, by, the, matador, and, banderilleros, with, the, magenta, and, gold, capote, cape, this, is, the, first, stage, the, tercio, de, varas, the, lancing, third, the, matador, confronts, the, bull, with, the, capote, performing, a, series, of, passes, and, observing, the, behavior, and, quirks, of, the, bull, next, a, picador, enters, the, arena, on, horseback, armed, with, a, vara, lance, to, protect, the, horse, from, the, bull, s, horns, the, animal, wears, a, protective, padded, covering, called, peto, prior, to, 1930, the, horses, did, not, wear, any, protection, often, the, bull, would, disembowel, the, horse, during, this, stage, until, the, use, of, protection, was, instituted, the, number, of, horses, killed, during, a, fiesta, generally, exceeded, the, number, of, bulls, killed, at, this, point, the, picador, stabs, just, behind, the, morrillo, a, mound, of, muscle, on, the, fighting, bull, s, neck, weakening, the, neck, muscles, and, leading, to, the, animal, s, first, loss, of, blood, the, manner, in, which, the, bull, charges, the, horse, provides, important, clues, to, the, matador, about, the, bull, such, as, which, horn, the, bull, favors, as, a, result, of, the, injury, and, also, the, fatigue, of, striving, to, injure, the, armoured, heavy, horse, the, bull, holds, its, head, and, horns, slightly, lower, during, the, following, stages, of, the, fight, this, ultimately, enables, the, matador, to, perform, the, killing, thrust, later, in, the, performance, the, encounter, with, the, picador, often, fundamentally, changes, the, behavior, of, a, bull, distracted, and, unengaging, bulls, will, become, more, focused, and, stay, on, a, single, target, instead, of, charging, at, everything, that, moves, conserving, their, diminished, energy, reserves, in, the, next, stage, the, tercio, de, banderillas, the, third, of, banderillas, each, of, the, three, banderilleros, attempts, to, plant, two, banderillas, sharp, barbed, sticks, into, the, bull, s, shoulders, these, anger, and, agitate, the, bull, reinvigorating, him, from, the, aplomado, literally, leadened, state, his, attacks, on, the, horse, and, injuries, from, the, lance, left, him, in, sometimes, a, matador, will, place, his, own, banderillas, if, so, he, usually, embellishes, this, part, of, his, performance, and, employs, more, varied, maneuvers, than, the, standard, al, cuarteo, method, commonly, used, by, banderilleros, in, the, final, stage, the, tercio, de, muerte, a, third, of, death, the, matador, re, enters, the, ring, alone, with, a, smaller, red, cloth, or, muleta, and, a, sword, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, the, color, red, is, supposed, to, anger, the, bull, the, animals, are, functionally, colorblind, in, this, respect, the, bull, is, incited, to, charge, by, the, movement, of, the, muleta, the, muleta, is, thought, to, be, red, to, mask, the, bull, s, blood, although, the, color, is, now, a, matter, of, tradition, the, matador, uses, his, muleta, to, attract, the, bull, in, a, series, of, passes, which, serve, the, dual, purpose, of, wearing, the, animal, down, for, the, kill, and, creating, sculptural, forms, between, man, and, animal, that, can, fascinate, or, thrill, the, audience, and, which, when, linked, together, in, a, rhythm, create, a, dance, of, passes, or, faena, the, matador, will, often, try, to, enhance, the, drama, of, the, dance, by, bringing, the, bull, s, horns, especially, close, to, his, body, the, faena, refers, to, the, entire, performance, with, the, muleta, the, faena, is, usually, broken, down, into, tandas, or, series, of, passes, the, faena, ends, with, a, final, series, of, passes, in, which, the, matador, using, the, cape, tries, to, maneuver, the, bull, into, a, position, to, stab, it, between, the, shoulder, blades, going, over, the, horns, and, thus, exposing, his, own, body, to, the, bull, the, sword, is, called, estoque, and, the, act, of, thrusting, the, sword, is, called, an, estocada, during, the, initial, series, while, the, matador, in, part, is, performing, for, the, crowd, he, uses, a, fake, sword, estoque, simulado, this, is, made, of, wood, or, aluminum, making, it, lighter, and, much, easier, to, handle, the, estoque, de, verdad, real, sword, is, made, out, of, steel, at, the, end, of, the, tercio, de, muerte, when, the, matador, has, finished, his, faena, he, will, change, swords, to, take, up, the, steel, one, he, performs, the, estocada, with, the, intent, of, piercing, the, heart, or, aorta, or, severing, other, major, blood, vessels, to, induce, a, quick, death, if, all, goes, according, to, plan, often, this, does, not, happen, and, repeated, efforts, must, be, made, to, bring, the, bull, down, sometimes, the, matador, changing, to, the, descabello, which, resembles, a, sword, but, is, actually, a, heavy, dagger, blade, at, the, end, of, a, steel, rod, which, is, thrust, between, the, cervical, vertebrae, to, sever, the, spinal, column, and, induce, instant, death, even, if, the, descabello, is, not, required, and, the, bull, falls, quickly, from, the, sword, one, of, the, banderilleros, will, perform, this, function, with, an, actual, dagger, to, ensure, the, bull, is, dead, if, the, matador, has, performed, particularly, well, the, crowd, may, petition, the, president, by, waving, white, handkerchiefs, to, award, the, matador, an, ear, of, the, bull, if, his, performance, was, exceptional, the, president, will, award, two, ears, in, certain, more, rural, rings, the, practice, includes, an, award, of, the, bull, s, tail, very, rarely, if, the, public, and, the, matador, believe, that, the, bull, has, fought, extremely, bravely, and, the, breeder, of, the, bull, agrees, to, have, it, return, to, the, ranch, the, event, s, president, may, grant, a, pardon, indulto, if, the, indulto, is, granted, the, bull, s, life, is, spared, it, leaves, the, ring, alive, and, is, returned, to, its, home, ranch, for, treatment, and, then, to, become, a, semental, or, seed, bull, for, the, rest, of, its, life, recortes, a, style, of, bullfighting, practiced, in, navarre, la, rioja, north, of, castile, and, valencia, has, been, much, less, popular, than, the, traditional, corridas, but, recortes, have, undergone, a, revival, in, spain, and, are, sometimes, broadcast, on, tv, this, style, was, common, in, the, early, 19th, century, etchings, by, painter, francisco, de, goya, depict, these, events, recortes, differ, from, corridas, in, the, following, manners, since, horses, are, not, used, and, performers, are, not, professionals, recortes, are, less, costly, to, produce, comical, spectacles, based, on, bullfighting, called, espect, culos, c, mico, taurinos, or, charlotadas, are, still, popular, in, spain, and, mexico, troupes, include, el, empastre, or, el, bombero,

tradition, of, such, bull, fights, particularly, during, holidays, such, as, whitsun, or, easter, among, france, s, most, important, venues, for, bullfighting, are, the, ancient, roman, arenas, of, n, mes, and, arles, although, there, are, bull, rings, across, the, south, from, the, mediterranean, to, the, atlantic, coasts, bullfights, of, this, kind, follow, the, spanish, tradition, and, even, spanish, words, are, used, for, all, bullfighting, related, terms, minor, cosmetic, differences, exist, such, as, music, this, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, bloodless, bullfights, referred, to, below, which, are, indigenous, to, france, a, more, indigenous, genre, of, bullfighting, is, widely, common, in, the, provence, and, languedoc, areas, and, is, known, alternately, as, course, libre, or, course, camarguaise, this, is, a, bloodless, spectacle, for, the, bulls, in, which, the, objective, is, to, snatch, a, rosette, from, the, head, of, a, young, bull, the, participants, or, raseteurs, begin, training, in, their, early, teens, against, young, bulls, from, the, camargue, region, of, provence, before, graduating, to, regular, contests, held, principally, in, arles, and, n, mes, but, also, in, other, proven, al, and, languedoc, towns, and, villages, before, the, course, an, abrivado, a, running, of, the, bulls, in, the, streets, takes, place, in, which, young, men, compete, to, outrun, the, charging, bulls, the, course, itself, takes, place, in, a, small, often, portable, arena, erected, in, a, town, square, for, a, period, of, about, 15, 20, minutes, the, raseteurs, compete, to, snatch, rosettes, cocarde, tied, between, the, bulls, horns, they, do, not, take, the, rosette, with, their, bare, hands, but, with, a, claw, shaped, metal, instrument, called, a, raset, or, crochet, hook, in, their, hands, hence, their, name, afterward, the, bulls, are, herded, back, to, their, pen, by, gardians, camarguais, cowboys, in, a, bandido, amidst, a, great, deal, of, ceremony, the, stars, of, these, spectacles, are, the, bulls, another, type, of, french, bullfighting, is, the, course, landaise, in, which, cows, are, used, instead, of, bulls, this, is, a, competition, between, teams, named, cuadrillas, which, belong, to, certain, breeding, estates, a, cuadrilla, is, made, up, of, a, teneur, de, corde, an, entra, neur, a, sauteur, and, six, carteurs, the, cows, are, brought, to, the, arena, in, crates, and, then, taken, out, in, order, the, teneur, de, corde, controls, the, dangling, rope, attached, to, the, cow, s, horns, and, the, entra, neur, positions, the, cow, to, face, and, attack, the, player, the, carteurs, will, try, at, the, last, possible, moment, to, dodge, around, the, cow, and, the, sauteur, will, leap, over, it, each, team, aims, to, complete, a, set, of, at, least, one, hundred, dodges, and, eight, leaps, this, is, the, main, scheme, of, the, classic, form, the, course, landaise, formelle, however, different, rules, may, be, applied, in, some, competitions, for, example, competitions, for, coupe, jeannot, lafittau, are, arranged, with, cows, without, ropes, at, one, point, it, resulted, in, so, many, fatalities, that, the, french, government, tried, to, ban, it, but, had, to, back, down, in, the, face, of, local, opposition, the, bulls, themselves, are, generally, fairly, small, much, less, imposing, than, the, adult, bulls, employed, in, the, corrida, nonetheless, the, bulls, remain, dangerous, due, to, their, mobility, and, vertically, formed, horns, participants, and, spectators, share, the, risk, it, is, not, unknown, for, angry, bulls, to, smash, their, way, through, barriers, and, charge, the, surrounding, crowd, of, spectators, the, course, landaise, is, not, seen, as, a, dangerous, sport, by, many, but, carteur, jean, pierre, rachou, died, in, 2003, when, a, bull, s, horn, tore, his, femoral, artery, spanish, style, bullfighting, is, usually, fatal, for, the, bull, and, it, is, also, dangerous, for, the, matador, matadors, are, usually, gored, every, season, with, picadors, and, banderilleros, being, gored, less, often, with, the, discovery, of, antibiotics, and, advances, in, surgical, techniques, fatalities, are, now, rare, although, over, the, past, three, centuries, 534, professional, bullfighters, have, died, in, the, ring, or, from, injuries, sustained, there, most, recently, iv, n, fandi, o, died, of, injuries, he, sustained, after, being, gored, by, a, bull, on, 17, june, 2017, in, aire, sur, l, adour, france, some, matadors, notably, juan, belmonte, have, been, seriously, gored, many, times, according, to, ernest, hemingway, belmonte, s, legs, were, marred, by, many, ugly, scars, a, special, type, of, surgeon, has, developed, in, spain, and, elsewhere, to, treat, cornadas, or, horn, wounds, the, bullring, has, a, chapel, where, a, matador, can, pray, before, the, corrida, and, where, a, priest, can, be, found, in, case, a, sacrament, is, needed, the, most, relevant, sacrament, is, now, called, anointing, of, the, sick, it, was, formerly, known, as, extreme, unction, or, the, last, rites, the, media, often, reports, the, more, horrific, of, bullfighting, injuries, such, as, the, september, 2011, goring, of, matador, juan, jos, padilla, s, head, by, a, bull, in, zaragoza, resulting, in, the, loss, of, his, left, eye, use, of, his, right, ear, and, facial, paralysis, he, returned, to, bullfighting, five, months, later, with, an, eyepatch, multiple, titanium, plates, in, his, skull, and, the, nickname, the, pirate, until, the, early, twentieth, century, the, horses, were, unprotected, and, were, commonly, gored, and, killed, or, left, close, to, death, intestines, destroyed, for, example, the, horses, used, were, old, and, worn, out, with, little, value, starting, in, the, twentieth, century, horses, were, protected, by, thick, blankets, and, wounds, though, not, unknown, were, less, common, and, less, serious, however, the, danger, lurks, not, only, from, a, bull, but, also, from, other, causes, such, as, too, weak, infrastructure, one, of, such, cases, happened, in, 2022, in, colombia, when, several, people, were, killed, and, more, than, 300, were, injured, after, a, stand, collapsed, during, the, bullfight, the, incident, happened, in, el, espinal, tolima, in, central, colombia, many, supporters, of, bullfighting, regard, it, as, a, deeply, ingrained, integral, part, of, their, national, cultures, in, spain, bullfighting, is, nicknamed, la, fiesta, nacional, the, national, fiesta, the, aesthetic, of, bullfighting, is, based, on, the, interaction, of, the, man, and, the, bull, rather, than, a, competitive, sport, the, bullfight, is, more, of, a, ritual, of, ancient, origin, which, is, judged,

as, a, symbol, of, spanish, national, culture, the, bullfight, is, regarded, as, a, demonstration, of, style, technique, and, courage, by, its, participants, and, as, a, demonstration, of, cruelty, and, cowardice, by, its, critics, while, there, is, usually, no, doubt, about, the, outcome, the, bull, is, not, viewed, by, bullfighting, supporters, as, a, sacrificial, victim, it, is, instead, seen, by, the, audience, as, a, worthy, adversary, deserving, of, respect, in, its, own, right, those, who, oppose, bullfighting, maintain, that, the, practice, is, a, sadistic, tradition, of,

all, aspects, of, any, bullfight, from, the, transport, to, the, death, are, in, themselves, causes, of, suffering, the, question, of, public, funding, is, particularly, controversial, in, spain, since, widely, disparaged, claims, have, been, made, by, supporters, and, opponents, of, bullfighting, according, to, government, figures, bullfighting, in, spain, generates, 1, 6, billion, a, year, and, 200, 000, jobs, 57, 000, of, which, are, directly, linked, to, the, industry, furthermore, bullfighting, is, the, cultural, activity, that, generates, the, most, tax, revenue, for, the, spanish,

claim, that, bullfighting, is, financed, with, public, money, however, though, bullfighting, attracts, 25, million, spectators, annually, it, represents, just, 0, 01, of, state, subsidies, allocated, to, cultural, activities, and, less, than, 3, of, the, cultural, budget, of, regional, provincial, and, local, authorities, the, bulk, of, subsidies, is, paid, by, town, halls, in, localities, where, there, is, a, historical, tradition, and, support, for, bullfighting, and, related, events, which, are, often, held, free, of, charge, to, participants, and, spectators, the, european, union, does,

anti, flamenquismo, a, campaign, against, the, popularity, of, both, bullfighting, and, flamenco, music, which, were, believed, to, be, oriental, elements, of, spanish, culture, that, were, responsible, for, spain, s, perceived, culture, gap, compared, to, the, rest, of, europe, in, francoist, spain, bullfights, received, great, governmental, support, as, they, were, considered, a, demonstration, of, greatness, of, the, spanish, nation, and, received, the, name, of, fiesta, nacional, bullfighting, was, therefore, highly, associated, with, the, regime, after, spain, s, transition, to, democracy, popular, support, for, bullfighting, declined, opposition, to, bullfighting, from, spain, s, political, parties, is, typically, highest, among, those, on, the, left, psoe, the, main, left, wing, political, party, has, distanced, itself, from, bullfighting, but, refuses, to, ban, it, while, spain, s, far, left, political, party, podemos, has, repeatedly, called, for, referendums, on, the, matter, and, has, shown, disapproval, of, the, practise, pp, the, largest, conservative, party, strongly, supports, bullfighting, and, has, requested, large, public, subsidies, for, it, the, government, of, jos, luis, rodr, guez, zapatero, was, the, first, to, oppose, bullfighting, prohibiting, children, under, 14, from, attending, events, and, imposing, a, six, year, ban, on, live, bullfights, broadcast, on, state, run, national, television, although, the, latter, measure, was, reversed, after, zapatero, s, party, lost, in, the, 2011, elections, despite, its, long, history, in, barcelona, bullfighting, was, outlawed, across, the, catalonia, region, in, 2010, following, a, campaign, led, by, an, animal, rights, civic, platform, called, prou, enough, in, catalan, critics, have, argued, that, the, ban, was, motivated, by, issues, of, catalan, separatism, and, identity, politics, in, october, 2016, the, constitutional, court, ruled, that, the, regional, catalan, parliament, did, not, have, the, authority, to, ban, events, that, are, legal, in, spain, the, spanish, royal, family, is, divided, on, the, issue, former, queen, consort, sof, a, of, spain,

have, been, practised, since, prehistoric, times, throughout, the, entire, mediterranean, coast, but, it, survives, only, in, iberia, and, in, part, of, france, during, the, muslim, rule, of, iberia,

bullfighting, events, are, celebrated, during, festivities, celebrating, local, patron, saints, along, with, other, activities, games, and, sports, the, bullfighting, world, is, also, inextricably,

cited, freedom, of, choice, and, respect, for, tradition, as, arguments, against, it, the, parliament, of, the, autonomous, community, of, catalonia, voted, in, favour, of, a, ban, on, bullfighting,

cockfighting, which, is, traditional, in, some, towns, in, the, islands, bullfighting, was, never, popular, in, the, canary, islands, some, supporters, of, bullfighting, and, even, lorenzo, olarte, cullen, canarian, head, of, government, at, the, time, have, argued, that, the, fighting, bull, is, not, a, domestic, animal, and, hence, the, law, does, not, ban, bullfighting, the, absence, of, spectacles, since, 1984, would, be, due, to, lack, of, demand, in, the, rest, of, spain, national, laws, against, cruelty, to, animals, have, abolished, most, blood, sports, but, specifically, exempt, bullfighting, on, 18, december, 2009, the, parliament, of, catalonia, one, of, spain, s, seventeen, autonomous, communities, approved, by, majority, the, preparation, of, a, law, to, ban,

is, essentially, catalan, and, valencian, in, other, parts, of, spain, they, have, other, names, a, movement, emerged, to, revoke, the, ban, in, the, spanish, congress, citing, the, value, of, bullfighting, as, cultural, heritage, the, proposal, was, backed, by, the, majority, of, parliamentarians, in, 2013, in, october, 2016, the, spanish, constitutional, court, ruled, that, the, regional, catalan, parliament, had, no, competence, to, ban, any, kind, of, spectacle, that, is, legal, in, spain, in, galicia, bullfighting, has, been, banned, in, many, cities, by, the, local, governments,

portuguese, community, in, gustine, lawmakers, determined, that, a, form, of, bloodless, bullfighting, would, be, allowed, to, continue, in, affiliation, with, certain, christian, holidays, though, the, bull, is, not, killed, as, with, traditional, bullfighting, it, is, still, intentionally, irritated, and, provoked, and, its, horns, are, shaved, down, to, prevent, injury, to, people, and, other, animals, present, in, the, ring, but, serious, injuries, still, can, and, do, occur, and, spectators, are, also, at, risk, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, has, expressed, opposition, to, bullfighting, in, all, its, forms, since, at, least, 1981, puerto, rico, banned, bullfighting, and, the, breeding, of, bulls, for, fights, by, law, no, 176, of, 25, july, 1998
