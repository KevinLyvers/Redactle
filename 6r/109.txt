honey, is, a, sweet, and, viscous, substance, made, by, several, species, of, bees, the, best, known, of, which, are, honey, bees, honey, is, made, and, stored, to, nourish, bee, colonies, bees, produce, honey, by, gathering, and, then, refining, the, sugary, secretions, of, plants, primarily, floral, nectar, or, the, secretions, of, other, insects, like, the, honeydew, of, aphids, this, refinement, takes, place, both, within, individual, bees, through, regurgitation, and, enzymatic, activity, and, during, storage, in, the, hive, through, water, evaporation, that, concentrates, the, honey, s, sugars, until, it, is, thick, and, viscous, honey, bees, stockpile, honey, in, the, hive, within, the, hive, is, a, structure, made, from, wax, called, honeycomb, the, honeycomb, is, made, up, of, hundreds, or, thousands, of, hexagonal, cells, into, which, the, bees, regurgitate, honey, for, storage, other, honey, producing, species, of, bee, store, the, substance, in, different, structures, such, as, the, pots, made, of, wax, and, resin, used, by, the, stingless, bee, honey, for, human, consumption, is, collected, from, wild, bee, colonies, or, from, the, hives, of, domesticated, bees, the, honey, produced, by, honey, bees, is, the, most, familiar, to, humans, thanks, to, its, worldwide, commercial, production, and, availability, the, husbandry, of, bees, is, known, as, beekeeping, or, apiculture, with, the, cultivation, of, stingless, bees, usually, referred, to, as, meliponiculture, honey, is, sweet, because, of, its, high, concentrations, of, the, monosaccharides, fructose, and, glucose, it, has, about, the, same, relative, sweetness, as, sucrose, table, sugar, one, standard, tablespoon, 15, ml, of, honey, provides, around, 190, kilojoules, 46, kilocalories, of, food, energy, it, has, attractive, chemical, properties, for, baking, and, a, distinctive, flavor, when, used, as, a, sweetener, most, microorganisms, cannot, grow, in, honey, and, sealed, honey, therefore, does, not, spoil, samples, of, honey, discovered, in, archaeological, contexts, have, proven, edible, even, after, millennia, honey, use, and, production, has, a, long, and, varied, history, with, its, beginnings, in, prehistoric, times, several, cave, paintings, in, cuevas, de, la, ara, a, in, spain, depict, humans, foraging, for, honey, at, least, 8, 000, years, ago, while, apis, mellifera, is, an, old, world, insect, large, scale, meliponiculture, of, new, world, stingless, bees, has, been, practiced, by, mayans, since, pre, columbian, times, honey, is, produced, by, bees, who, have, collected, nectar, or, honeydew, bees, value, honey, for, its, sugars, which, they, consume, to, support, general, metabolic, activity, especially, that, of, their, flight, muscles, during, foraging, and, as, a, food, for, their, larvae, to, this, end, bees, stockpile, honey, to, provide, for, themselves, during, ordinary, foraging, as, well, as, during, lean, periods, as, in, overwintering, during, foraging, bees, use, part, of, the, nectar, they, collect, to, power, their, flight, muscles, the, majority, of, nectar, collected, is, not, used, to, directly, nourish, the, insects, but, is, instead, destined, for, regurgitation, enzymatic, digestion, and, finally, long, term, storage, as, honey, during, cold, weather, or, when, other, food, sources, are, scarce, adult, and, larval, bees, consume, stored, honey, which, is, many, times, as, energy, dense, as, the, nectar, from, which, it, is, made, after, leaving, the, hive, a, foraging, bee, collects, sugar, rich, nectar, or, honeydew, nectar, from, the, flower, generally, has, a, water, content, of, 70, to, 80, and, is, much, less, viscous, than, finished, honey, which, usually, has, a, water, content, around, 18, the, water, content, of, honeydew, from, aphids, and, other, true, bugs, is, generally, very, close, to, the, sap, on, which, those, insects, feed, and, is, usually, somewhat, more, dilute, than, nectar, one, source, describes, the, water, content, of, honeydew, as, around, 89, whether, it, is, feeding, on, nectar, or, honeydew, the, bee, sucks, these, runny, fluids, through, its, proboscis, which, delivers, the, liquid, to, the, bee, s, honey, stomach, or, honey, crop, this, cavity, lies, just, above, its, food, stomach, the, latter, of, which, digests, pollen, and, sugars, consumed, by, an, individual, honey, bee, for, its, own, nourishment, in, apis, mellifera, the, honey, stomach, holds, about, 40, mg, of, liquid, this, is, about, half, the, weight, of, an, unladen, bee, collecting, this, quantity, in, nectar, can, require, visits, to, more, than, a, thousand, flowers, when, nectar, is, plentiful, it, can, take, a, bee, more, than, an, hour, of, ceaseless, work, to, collect, enough, nectar, to, fill, its, honey, crop, salivary, enzymes, and, proteins, from, the, bee, s, hypopharyngeal, gland, are, secreted, into, the, nectar, once, it, is, in, the, bee, s, honey, stomach, these, substances, begin, cleaving, complex, sugars, like, sucrose, and, starches, into, simpler, sugars, such, as, glucose, and, fructose, this, process, slightly, raises, the, water, content, and, the, acidity, of, the, partially, digested, nectar, once, filled, the, forager, bees, return, to, the, hive, there, they, regurgitate, and, transfer, nectar, to, hive, bees, once, in, their, own, honey, stomachs, the, hive, bees, regurgitate, the, nectar, repeatedly, forming, bubbles, between, their, mandibles, speeding, its, digestion, and, concentration, these, bubbles, create, a, large, surface, area, per, volume, and, by, this, means, the, bees, evaporate, a, portion, of, the, nectar, s, water, into, the, warm, air, of, the, hive, hive, bees, form, honey, processing, groups, these, groups, work, in, relay, with, one, bee, subjecting, the, processed, nectar, to, bubbling, and, then, passing, the, refined, liquid, on, to, others, it, can, take, as, long, as, 20, minutes, of, continuous, regurgitation, digestion, and, evaporation, until, the, product, reaches, storage, quality, the, new, honey, is, then, placed, in, honeycomb, cells, which, are, left, uncapped, this, honey, still, has, a, very, high, water, content, up, to, 70, depending, on, the, concentration, of, nectar, gathered, at, this, stage, of, its, refinement, the, water, content, of, the, honey, is, high, enough, that, ubiquitous, yeast, spores, can, reproduce, in, it, a, process, which, if, left, unchecked, would, rapidly, consume, the, new, honey, s, sugars, to, combat, this, bees, use, an, ability, rare, among, insects, the, endogenous, generation, of, heat, bees, are, among, the, few, insects, that, can, create, large, amounts, of, body, heat, they, use, this, ability, to, produce, a, constant, ambient, temperature, in, their, hives, hive, temperatures, are, usually, around, 35, c, 95, f, in, the, honey, storage, areas, this, temperature, is, regulated, either, by, generating, heat, with, their, bodies, or, removing, it, through, water, evaporation, the, evaporation, removes, water, from, the, stored, honey, drawing, heat, from, the, colony, the, bees, use, their, wings, to, govern, hive, cooling, coordinated, wing, beating, moves, air, across, the, wet, honey, drawing, out, water, and, heat, ventilation, of, the, hive, eventually, expels, both, excess, water, and, heat, into, the, outside, world, the, process, of, evaporating, continues, until, the, honey, reaches, its, final, water, content, of, between, 15, 5, to, 18, this, concentrates, the, sugars, far, beyond, the, saturation, point, of, water, which, is, to, say, there, is, far, more, sugar, dissolved, in, what, little, water, remains, in, honey, than, ever, could, be, dissolved, in, an, equivalent, volume, of, water, honey, even, at, hive, temperatures, is, therefore, a, supercooled, solution, of, various, sugars, in, water, these, concentrations, of, sugar, can, only, be, achieved, near, room, temperature, by, evaporation, of, a, less, concentrated, solution, in, this, case, nectar, for, osmotic, reasons, such, high, concentrations, of, sugar, are, extremely, unfavorable, to, microbiological, reproduction, and, all, fermentation, is, consequently, halted, the, bees, then, cap, the, cells, of, finished, honey, with, wax, this, seals, them, from, contamination, and, prevents, further, evaporation, so, long, as, its, water, concentration, does, not, rise, much, above, 18, honey, has, an, indefinite, shelf, life, both, within, the, hive, and, after, its, removal, by, a, beekeeper, honey, bees, are, not, the, only, eusocial, insects, to, produce, honey, all, non, parasitic, bumblebees, and, stingless, bees, produce, honey, some, wasp, species, such, as, brachygastra, lecheguana, and, brachygastra, mellifica, found, in, south, and, central, america, are, known, to, feed, on, nectar, and, produce, honey, other, wasps, such, as, polistes, versicolor, also, consume, honey, in, the, middle, of, their, life, cycles, they, alternate, between, feeding, on, protein, rich, pollen, and, feeding, on, honey, which, is, a, far, denser, source, of, food, energy, human, beings, have, semi, domesticated, several, species, of, honey, bee, by, taking, advantage, of, their, swarming, stage, swarming, is, the, means, by, which, new, colonies, are, established, when, there, is, no, longer, space, for, expansion, in, the, colony, s, present, hive, the, old, queen, lays, eggs, that, will, develop, into, new, queens, and, then, leads, as, many, as, half, the, colony, to, a, site, for, a, new, hive, bees, generally, swarm, before, a, suitable, location, for, another, hive, has, been, discovered, by, scouts, sent, out, for, this, purpose, until, such, a, location, is, found, the, swarm, will, simply, conglomerate, near, the, former, hive, often, from, tree, branches, these, swarms, are, unusually, docile, and, amenable, to, transport, by, humans, when, provided, with, a, suitable, nesting, site, such, as, a, commercial, langstroth, hive, the, swarm, will, readily, form, a, new, colony, in, artificial, surroundings, these, semi, domesticated, colonies, are, then, looked, after, by, humans, practicing, apiculture, or, meliponiculture, captured, bees, are, encouraged, to, forage, often, in, agricultural, settings, such, as, orchards, where, pollinators, are, highly, valued, the, honey, pollen, wax, and, resins, the, bees, produce, are, all, harvested, by, humans, for, a, variety, of, uses, the, term, semi, domesticated, is, preferred, because, all, bee, colonies, even, those, in, very, large, agricultural, apiculture, operations, readily, leave, the, protection, of, humans, in, swarms, that, can, establish, successful, wild, colonies, much, of, the, effort, in, commercial, beekeeping, is, dedicated, to, persuading, a, hive, that, is, ready, to, swarm, to, produce, more, honeycomb, in, its, present, location, this, is, usually, done, by, adding, more, space, to, the, colony, with, honey, supers, empty, boxes, placed, on, top, of, an, existing, colony, the, bees, can, then, usually, be, enticed, to, develop, this, empty, space, instead, of, dividing, their, colony, through, swarming, honey, is, collected, from, wild, bee, colonies, or, from, domesticated, beehives, on, average, a, hive, will, produce, about, 29, kilograms, 65, lb, of, honey, per, year, wild, bee, nests, are, sometimes, located, by, following, a, honeyguide, bird, to, safely, collect, honey, from, a, hive, beekeepers, typically, pacify, the, bees, using, a, bee, smoker, the, smoke, triggers, a, feeding, instinct, an, attempt, to, save, the, resources, of, the, hive, from, a, possible, fire, making, them, less, aggressive, and, obscures, the, pheromones, the, bees, use, to, communicate, the, honeycomb, is, removed, from, the, hive, and, the, honey, may, be, extracted, from, it, either, by, crushing, or, by, using, a, honey, extractor, the, honey, is, then, usually, filtered, to, remove, beeswax, and, other, debris, before, the, invention, of, removable, frames, bee, colonies, were, often, sacrificed, to, conduct, the, harvest, the, harvester, would, take, all, the, available, honey, and, replace, the, entire, colony, the, next, spring, since, the, invention, of, removable, frames, the, principles, of, husbandry, led, most, beekeepers, to, ensure, that, their, bees, have, enough, stores, to, survive, the, winter, either, by, leaving, some, honey, in, the, beehive, or, by, providing, the, colony, with, a, honey, substitute, such, as, sugar, water, or, crystalline, sugar, often, in, the, form, of, a, candyboard, the, amount, of, food, necessary, to, survive, the, winter, depends, on, the, variety, of, bees, and, on, the, length, and, severity, of, local, winters, many, animal, species, are, attracted, to, wild, or, domestic, sources, of, honey, because, of, its, composition, and, chemical, properties, honey, is, suitable, for, long, term, storage, and, is, easily, assimilated, even, after, long, preservation, honey, and, objects, immersed, in, honey, have, been, preserved, for, centuries, however, no, edible, honey, has, been, found, in, egyptian, tombs, all, such, cases, have, been, proven, to, be, other, substances, or, only, chemical, traces, the, key, to, preservation, is, limiting, access, to, humidity, in, its, cured, state, honey, has, a, sufficiently, high, sugar, content, to, inhibit, fermentation, if, exposed, to, moist, air, its, hydrophilic, properties, pull, moisture, into, the, honey, eventually, diluting, it, to, the, point, that, fermentation, can, begin, the, long, shelf, life, of, honey, is, attributed, to, an, enzyme, found, in, the, stomach, of, bees, the, bees, mix, glucose, oxidase, with, expelled, nectar, they, previously, consumed, creating, two, byproducts, gluconic, acid, and, hydrogen, peroxide, which, are, partially, responsible, for, honey, acidity, and, suppression, of, bacterial, growth, honey, is, sometimes, adulterated, by, the, addition, of, other, sugars, syrups, or, compounds, to, change, its, flavor, or, viscosity, reduce, cost, or, increase, the, fructose, content, to, inhibit, crystallization, adulteration, of, honey, has, been, practiced, since, ancient, times, when, honey, was, sometimes, blended, with, plant, syrups, such, as, maple, birch, or, sorghum, and, sold, to, customers, as, pure, honey, sometimes, crystallized, honey, was, mixed, with, flour, or, other, fillers, hiding, the, adulteration, from, buyers, until, the, honey, was, liquefied, in, modern, times, the, most, common, adulterant, became, clear, almost, flavorless, corn, syrup, the, adulterated, mixture, can, be, very, difficult, to, distinguish, from, pure, honey, according, to, the, codex, alimentarius, of, the, united, nations, any, product, labeled, as, honey, or, pure, honey, must, be, a, wholly, natural, product, although, labeling, laws, differ, between, countries, in, the, united, states, according, to, the, national, honey, board, ensuring, honey, authenticity, is, one, of, the, great, challenges, facing, the, honey, industry, today, over, the, past, half, century, a, number, of, honey, testing, methods, have, been, developed, to, detect, food, fraud, to, date, there, is, no, single, universal, analytical, method, available, which, is, capable, of, detecting, all, types, of, adulteration, with, adequate, sensitivity, isotope, ratio, mass, spectrometry, can, be, used, to, detect, addition, of, corn, syrup, and, cane, sugar, by, the, carbon, isotopic, signature, addition, of, sugars, originating, from, corn, or, sugar, cane, c4, plants, unlike, the, plants, used, by, bees, and, also, sugar, beet, which, are, predominantly, c3, plants, skews, the, isotopic, ratio, of, sugars, present, in, honey, but, does, not, influence, the, isotopic, ratio, of, proteins, in, an, unadulterated, honey, the, carbon, isotopic, ratios, of, sugars, and, proteins, should, match, levels, as, low, as, 7, of, addition, can, be, detected, in, 2020, global, production, of, honey, was, 1, 8, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 26, of, the, world, total, table, other, major, producers, were, turkey, iran, argentina, and, ukraine, over, its, history, as, a, food, the, main, uses, of, honey, are, in, cooking, baking, desserts, as, a, spread, on, bread, as, an, addition, to, various, beverages, such, as, tea, and, as, a, sweetener, in, some, commercial, beverages, due, to, its, energy, density, honey, is, an, important, food, for, virtually, all, hunter, gatherer, cultures, in, warm, climates, with, the, hadza, people, ranking, honey, as, their, favorite, food, honey, hunters, in, africa, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, certain, species, of, honeyguide, birds, possibly, the, world, s, oldest, fermented, beverage, dating, from, 9, 000, years, ago, mead, honey, wine, is, the, alcoholic, product, made, by, adding, yeast, to, honey, water, must, and, fermenting, it, for, weeks, or, months, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, is, commonly, used, in, modern, mead, production, mead, varieties, include, drinks, called, metheglin, with, spices, or, herbs, melomel, with, fruit, juices, such, as, grape, specifically, called, pyment, hippocras, with, cinnamon, and, sack, mead, high, concentration, of, honey, many, of, which, have, been, developed, as, commercial, products, numbering, in, the, hundreds, in, the, united, states, honey, is, also, used, to, make, mead, beer, called, braggot, the, physical, properties, of, honey, vary, depending, on, water, content, the, type, of, flora, used, to, produce, it, pasturage, temperature, and, the, proportion, of, the, specific, sugars, it, contains, fresh, honey, is, a, supersaturated, liquid, containing, more, sugar, than, the, water, can, typically, dissolve, at, ambient, temperatures, at, room, temperature, honey, is, a, supercooled, liquid, in, which, the, glucose, precipitates, into, solid, granules, this, forms, a, semisolid, solution, of, precipitated, glucose, crystals, in, a, solution, of, fructose, and, other, ingredients, the, density, of, honey, typically, ranges, between, 1, 38, and, 1, 45, kg, l, at, 20, c, the, melting, point, of, crystallized, honey, is, between, 40, and, 50, c, 104, and, 122, f, depending, on, its, composition, below, this, temperature, honey, can, be, either, in, a, metastable, state, meaning, that, it, will, not, crystallize, until, a, seed, crystal, is, added, or, more, often, it, is, in, a, labile, state, being, saturated, with, enough, sugars, to, crystallize, spontaneously, the, rate, of, crystallization, is, affected, by, many, factors, but, the, primary, factor, is, the, ratio, of, the, main, sugars, fructose, to, glucose, honeys, that, are, supersaturated, with, a, very, high, percentage, of, glucose, such, as, brassica, honey, crystallize, almost, immediately, after, harvesting, while, honeys, with, a, low, percentage, of, glucose, such, as, chestnut, or, tupelo, honey, do, not, crystallize, some, types, of, honey, may, produce, few, but, very, large, crystals, while, others, produce, many, small, crystals, crystallization, is, also, affected, by, water, content, because, a, high, percentage, of, water, inhibits, crystallization, as, does, a, high, dextrin, content, temperature, also, affects, the, rate, of, crystallization, with, the, fastest, growth, occurring, between, 13, and, 17, c, 55, and, 63, f, crystal, nuclei, seeds, tend, to, form, more, readily, if, the, honey, is, disturbed, by, stirring, shaking, or, agitating, rather, than, if, left, at, rest, however, the, nucleation, of, microscopic, seed, crystals, is, greatest, between, 5, and, 8, c, 41, and, 46, f, therefore, larger, but, fewer, crystals, tend, to, form, at, higher, temperatures, while, smaller, but, more, numerous, crystals, usually, form, at, lower, temperatures, below, 5, c, the, honey, will, not, crystallize, thus, the, original, texture, and, flavor, can, be, preserved, indefinitely, honey, is, a, supercooled, liquid, when, stored, below, its, melting, point, as, is, normal, at, very, low, temperatures, honey, does, not, freeze, solid, rather, its, viscosity, increases, like, most, viscous, liquids, the, honey, becomes, thick, and, sluggish, with, decreasing, temperature, at, 20, c, 4, f, honey, may, appear, or, even, feel, solid, but, it, continues, to, flow, at, very, low, rates, honey, has, a, glass, transition, between, 42, and, 51, c, 44, and, 60, f, below, this, temperature, honey, enters, a, glassy, state, and, becomes, an, amorphous, solid, noncrystalline, the, viscosity, of, honey, is, affected, greatly, by, both, temperature, and, water, content, the, higher, the, water, percentage, the, more, easily, honey, flows, above, its, melting, point, however, water, has, little, effect, on, viscosity, aside, from, water, content, the, composition, of, most, types, of, honey, also, has, little, effect, on, viscosity, at, 25, c, 77, f, honey, with, 14, water, content, generally, has, a, viscosity, around, 400, poise, while, a, honey, containing, 20, water, has, a, viscosity, around, 20, poise, viscosity, increases, very, slowly, with, moderate, cooling, a, honey, containing, 16, water, at, 70, c, 158, f, has, a, viscosity, around, 2, poise, while, at, 30, c, 86, f, the, viscosity, is, around, 70, poise, with, further, cooling, the, increase, in, viscosity, is, more, rapid, reaching, 600, poise, at, around, 14, c, 57, f, however, while, honey, is, viscous, it, has, low, surface, tension, of, 50, 60, mj, m, 2, making, its, wettability, similar, to, water, glycerin, or, most, other, liquids, the, high, viscosity, and, wettability, of, honey, cause, stickiness, which, is, a, time, dependent, process, in, supercooled, liquids, between, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, and, the, crystalline, melting, temperature, most, types, of, honey, are, newtonian, liquids, but, a, few, types, have, non, newtonian, viscous, properties, honeys, from, heather, or, manuka, display, thixotropic, properties, these, types, of, honey, enter, a, gel, like, state, when, motionless, but, liquefy, when, stirred, because, honey, contains, electrolytes, in, the, form, of, acids, and, minerals, it, exhibits, varying, degrees, of, electrical, conductivity, measurements, of, the, electrical, conductivity, are, used, to, determine, the, quality, of, honey, in, terms, of, ash, content, the, effect, honey, has, on, light, is, useful, for, determining, the, type, and, quality, variations, in, its, water, content, alter, its, refractive, index, water, content, can, easily, be, measured, with, a, refractometer, typically, the, refractive, index, for, honey, ranges, from, 1, 504, at, 13, water, content, to, 1, 474, at, 25, honey, also, has, an, effect, on, polarized, light, in, that, it, rotates, the, polarization, plane, the, fructose, gives, a, negative, rotation, while, the, glucose, gives, a, positive, one, the, overall, rotation, can, be, used, to, measure, the, ratio, of, the, mixture, honey, is, generally, pale, yellow, and, dark, brown, in, color, but, other, colors, can, occur, depending, on, the, sugar, source, bee, colonies, that, forage, on, kudzu, pueraria, montana, var, lobata, flowers, for, example, produce, honey, that, varies, in, color, from, red, to, purple, honey, has, the, ability, to, absorb, moisture, directly, from, the, air, a, phenomenon, called, hygroscopy, the, amount, of, water, the, honey, absorbs, is, dependent, on, the, relative, humidity, of, the, air, because, honey, contains, yeast, this, hygroscopic, nature, requires, that, honey, be, stored, in, sealed, containers, to, prevent, fermentation, which, usually, begins, if, the, honey, s, water, content, rises, much, above, 25, honey, tends, to, absorb, more, water, in, this, manner, than, the, individual, sugars, allow, on, their, own, which, may, be, due, to, other, ingredients, it, contains, fermentation, of, honey, usually, occurs, after, crystallization, because, without, the, glucose, the, liquid, portion, of, the, honey, primarily, consists, of, a, concentrated, mixture, of, fructose, acids, and, water, providing, the, yeast, with, enough, of, an, increase, in, the, water, percentage, for, growth, honey, that, is, to, be, stored, at, room, temperature, for, long, periods, of, time, is, often, pasteurized, to, kill, any, yeast, by, heating, it, above, 70, c, 158, f, like, all, sugar, compounds, honey, caramelizes, if, heated, sufficiently, becoming, darker, in, color, and, eventually, burns, however, honey, contains, fructose, which, caramelizes, at, lower, temperatures, than, glucose, the, temperature, at, which, caramelization, begins, varies, depending, on, the, composition, but, is, typically, between, 70, and, 110, c, 158, and, 230, f, honey, also, contains, acids, which, act, as, catalysts, for, caramelization, the, specific, types, of, acids, and, their, amounts, play, a, primary, role, in, determining, the, exact, temperature, of, these, acids, the, amino, acids, which, occur, in, very, small, amounts, play, an, important, role, in, the, darkening, of, honey, the, amino, acids, form, darkened, compounds, called, melanoidins, during, a, maillard, reaction, the, maillard, reaction, occurs, slowly, at, room, temperature, taking, from, a, few, to, several, months, to, show, visible, darkening, but, speeds, up, dramatically, with, increasing, temperatures, however, the, reaction, can, also, be, slowed, by, storing, the, honey, at, colder, temperatures, unlike, many, other, liquids, honey, has, very, poor, thermal, conductivity, of, 0, 5, w, m, k, at, 13, water, content, compared, to, 401, w, m, k, of, copper, taking, a, long, time, to, reach, thermal, equilibrium, due, to, its, high, kinematic, viscosity, honey, does, not, transfer, heat, through, momentum, diffusion, convection, but, rather, through, thermal, diffusion, more, like, a, solid, so, melting, crystallized, honey, can, easily, result, in, localized, caramelization, if, the, heat, source, is, too, hot, or, not, evenly, distributed, however, honey, takes, substantially, longer, to, liquefy, when, just, above, the, melting, point, than, at, elevated, temperatures, melting, 20, kg, 44, lb, of, crystallized, honey, at, 40, c, 104, f, can, take, up, to, 24, hours, while, 50, kg, 110, lb, may, take, twice, as, long, these, times, can, be, cut, nearly, in, half, by, heating, at, 50, c, 122, f, however, many, of, the, minor, substances, in, honey, can, be, affected, greatly, by, heating, changing, the, flavor, aroma, or, other, properties, so, heating, is, usually, done, at, the, lowest, temperature, and, for, the, shortest, time, possible, the, average, ph, of, honey, is, 3, 9, but, can, range, from, 3, 4, to, 6, 1, honey, contains, many, kinds, of, acids, both, organic, and, amino, however, the, different, types, and, their, amounts, vary, considerably, depending, on, the, type, of, honey, these, acids, may, be, aromatic, or, aliphatic, nonaromatic, the, aliphatic, acids, contribute, greatly, to, the, flavor, of, honey, by, interacting, with, the, flavors, of, other, ingredients, organic, acids, comprise, most, of, the, acids, in, honey, accounting, for, 0, 17, 1, 17, of, the, mixture, with, gluconic, acid, formed, by, the, actions, of, glucose, oxidase, as, the, most, prevalent, minor, amounts, of, other, organic, acids, are, present, consisting, of, formic, acetic, butyric, citric, lactic, malic, pyroglutamic, propionic, valeric, capronic, palmitic, and, succinic, among, many, others, individual, honeys, from, different, plant, sources, contain, over, 100, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, which, play, a, primary, role, in, determining, honey, flavors, and, aromas, vocs, are, carbon, based, compounds, that, readily, vaporize, into, the, air, providing, aroma, including, the, scents, of, flowers, essential, oils, or, ripening, fruit, the, typical, chemical, families, of, vocs, found, in, honey, include, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, esters, acids, benzenes, furans, pyrans, norisoprenoids, and, terpenes, among, many, others, and, their, derivatives, the, specific, vocs, and, their, amounts, vary, considerably, between, different, types, of, honey, obtained, by, bees, foraging, on, different, plant, sources, by, example, when, comparing, the, mixture, of, vocs, in, different, honeys, in, one, review, longan, honey, had, a, higher, amount, of, volatiles, 48, vocs, while, sunflower, honey, had, the, lowest, number, of, volatiles, 8, vocs, vocs, are, primarily, introduced, into, the, honey, from, the, nectar, where, they, are, excreted, by, the, flowers, imparting, individual, scents, the, specific, types, and, concentrations, of, certain, vocs, can, be, used, to, determine, the, type, of, flora, used, to, produce, monofloral, honeys, the, specific, geography, soil, composition, and, acidity, used, to, grow, the, flora, also, have, an, effect, on, honey, aroma, properties, such, as, a, fruity, or, grassy, aroma, from, longan, honey, or, a, waxy, aroma, from, sunflower, honey, dominant, vocs, in, one, study, were, linalool, oxide, trans, linalool, oxide, 2, phenylacetaldehyde, benzyl, ethanol, isophorone, and, methyl, nonanoate, vocs, can, also, be, introduced, from, the, bodies, of, the, bees, be, produced, by, the, enzymatic, actions, of, digestion, or, from, chemical, reactions, that, occur, between, different, substances, within, the, honey, during, storage, and, therefore, may, change, increase, or, decrease, over, long, periods, of, time, vocs, may, be, produced, altered, or, greatly, affected, by, temperature, and, processing, some, vocs, are, heat, labile, and, are, destroyed, at, elevated, temperatures, while, others, can, be, created, during, non, enzymatic, reactions, such, as, the, maillard, reaction, vocs, are, responsible, for, nearly, all, of, the, aroma, produced, by, a, honey, which, may, be, described, as, sweet, flowery, citrus, almond, or, rancid, among, other, terms, in, addition, vocs, play, a, large, role, in, determining, the, specific, flavor, of, the, honey, both, through, the, aromas, and, flavor, vocs, from, honeys, in, different, geographic, regions, can, be, used, as, floral, markers, of, those, regions, and, as, markers, of, the, bees, that, foraged, the, nectars, honey, is, classified, by, its, source, floral, or, not, and, divisions, are, made, according, to, the, packaging, and, processing, used, regional, honeys, are, also, identified, in, the, us, honey, is, also, graded, on, its, color, and, optical, density, by, usda, standards, graded, on, the, pfund, scale, which, ranges, from, 0, for, water, white, honey, to, more, than, 114, for, dark, amber, honey, generally, honey, is, classified, by, the, floral, source, of, the, nectar, from, which, it, was, made, honeys, can, be, from, specific, types, of, flower, nectars, or, can, be, blended, after, collection, the, pollen, in, honey, is, traceable, to, floral, source, and, therefore, region, of, origin, the, rheological, and, melissopalynological, properties, of, honey, can, be, used, to, identify, the, major, plant, nectar, source, used, in, its, production, monofloral, honey, is, made, primarily, from, the, nectar, of, one, type, of, flower, monofloral, honeys, have, distinctive, flavors, and, colors, because, of, differences, between, their, principal, nectar, sources, to, produce, monofloral, honey, beekeepers, keep, beehives, in, an, area, where, the, bees, have, access, as, far, as, possible, to, only, one, type, of, flower, in, practice, a, small, proportion, of, any, monofloral, honey, will, be, from, other, flower, types, typical, examples, of, north, american, monofloral, honeys, are, clover, orange, blossom, sage, tupelo, buckwheat, fireweed, mesquite, sourwood, cherry, and, blueberry, some, typical, european, examples, include, thyme, thistle, heather, acacia, dandelion, sunflower, lavender, honeysuckle, and, varieties, from, lime, and, chestnut, trees, in, north, africa, e, g, egypt, examples, include, clover, cotton, and, citrus, mainly, orange, blossoms, the, unique, flora, of, australia, yields, a, number, of, distinctive, honeys, with, some, of, the, most, popular, being, yellow, box, blue, gum, ironbark, bush, mallee, tasmanian, leatherwood, and, macadamia, polyfloral, honey, also, known, as, wildflower, honey, is, derived, from, the, nectar, of, many, types, of, flowers, the, taste, may, vary, from, year, to, year, and, the, aroma, and, the, flavor, can, be, more, or, less, intense, depending, on, which, flowers, are, blooming, honeydew, honey, is, made, from, bees, taking, direct, secretions, from, trees, such, as, pine, fir, chestnut, and, oak, or, primarily, honeydew, the, sweet, secretions, of, aphids, or, other, plant, sap, sucking, insects, to, produce, honey, rather, than, from, nectar, this, honey, has, a, much, larger, proportion, of, indigestibles, than, light, floral, honeys, thus, causing, dysentery, to, the, bees, honeydew, honey, has, a, stronger, and, less, sweet, flavor, than, nectar, based, honey, and, european, countries, have, been, the, primary, market, for, honeydew, honey, in, greece, pine, honey, a, type, of, honeydew, honey, constitutes, 60, 65, of, honey, production, generally, honey, is, bottled, in, its, familiar, liquid, form, but, it, is, sold, in, other, forms, and, can, be, subjected, to, a, variety, of, processing, methods, countries, have, differing, standards, for, grading, honey, in, the, us, honey, grading, is, performed, voluntarily, based, upon, usda, standards, usda, offers, inspection, and, grading, as, on, line, in, plant, or, lot, inspection, upon, application, on, a, fee, for, service, basis, honey, is, graded, based, upon, a, number, of, factors, including, water, content, flavor, and, aroma, absence, of, defects, and, clarity, honey, is, also, classified, by, color, though, it, is, not, a, factor, in, the, grading, scale, the, usda, honey, grade, scale, is, india, certifies, honey, grades, based, on, additional, factors, such, as, the, fiehe, s, test, and, other, empirical, measurements, high, quality, honey, can, be, distinguished, by, fragrance, taste, and, consistency, ripe, freshly, collected, high, quality, honey, at, 20, c, 68, f, should, flow, from, a, knife, in, a, straight, stream, without, breaking, into, separate, drops, after, falling, down, the, honey, should, form, a, bead, the, honey, when, poured, should, form, small, temporary, layers, that, disappear, fairly, quickly, indicating, high, viscosity, if, not, it, indicates, honey, with, excessive, water, content, of, over, 20, not, suitable, for, long, term, preservation, in, jars, fresh, honey, should, appear, as, a, pure, consistent, fluid, and, should, not, set, in, layers, within, a, few, weeks, to, a, few, months, of, extraction, many, varieties, of, honey, crystallize, into, a, cream, colored, solid, some, varieties, of, honey, including, tupelo, acacia, and, sage, crystallize, less, regularly, honey, may, be, heated, during, bottling, at, temperatures, of, 40, 49, c, 104, 120, f, to, delay, or, inhibit, crystallization, overheating, is, indicated, by, change, in, enzyme, levels, for, instance, diastase, activity, which, can, be, determined, with, the, schade, or, the, phadebas, methods, a, fluffy, film, on, the, surface, of, the, honey, like, a, white, foam, or, marble, colored, or, white, spotted, crystallization, on, a, container, s, sides, is, formed, by, air, bubbles, trapped, during, the, bottling, process, a, 2008, italian, study, determined, that, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, can, be, used, to, distinguish, between, different, honey, types, and, can, be, used, to, pinpoint, the, area, where, it, was, produced, researchers, were, able, to, identify, differences, in, acacia, and, polyfloral, honeys, by, the, differing, proportions, of, fructose, and, sucrose, as, well, as, differing, levels, of, aromatic, amino, acids, phenylalanine, and, tyrosine, this, ability, allows, greater, ease, of, selecting, compatible, stocks, one, hundred, grams, of, honey, provides, about, 1, 270, kj, 304, kcal, of, energy, with, no, significant, amounts, of, essential, nutrients, composed, of, 17, water, and, 82, carbohydrates, honey, has, low, content, of, fat, dietary, fiber, and, protein, a, mixture, of, sugars, and, other, carbohydrates, honey, is, mainly, fructose, about, 38, and, glucose, about, 32, with, remaining, sugars, including, maltose, sucrose, and, other, complex, carbohydrates, its, glycemic, index, ranges, from, 31, to, 78, depending, on, the, variety, the, specific, composition, color, aroma, and, flavor, of, any, batch, of, honey, depend, on, the, flowers, foraged, by, bees, that, produced, the, honey, one, 1980, study, found, that, mixed, floral, honey, from, several, united, states, regions, typically, contains, the, following, this, means, that, 55, of, the, combined, fructose, and, glucose, content, was, fructose, and, 45, was, glucose, which, enables, comparison, with, the, essentially, identical, result, average, of, 56, and, 44, in, the, study, described, below, a, 2013, nmr, spectroscopy, study, of, 20, different, honeys, from, germany, found, that, their, sugar, contents, comprised, the, average, ratio, was, 56, fructose, to, 44, glucose, but, the, ratios, in, the, individual, honeys, ranged, from, a, high, of, 64, fructose, and, 36, glucose, one, type, of, flower, honey, table, 3, in, reference, to, a, low, of, 50, fructose, and, 50, glucose, a, different, floral, source, this, nmr, method, was, not, able, to, quantify, maltose, galactose, and, the, other, minor, sugars, as, compared, to, fructose, and, glucose, honey, is, a, folk, treatment, for, burns, and, other, skin, injuries, preliminary, evidence, suggests, that, it, aids, in, the, healing, of, partial, thickness, burns, 4, 5, days, faster, than, other, dressings, and, moderate, evidence, suggests, that, post, operative, infections, treated, with, honey, heal, faster, and, with, fewer, adverse, events, than, with, antiseptic, and, gauze, the, evidence, for, the, use, of, honey, in, various, other, wound, treatments, is, of, low, quality, and, firm, conclusions, cannot, be, drawn, evidence, does, not, support, the, use, of, honey, based, products, for, the, treatment, of, venous, stasis, ulcers, or, ingrown, toenail, several, medical, grade, honey, products, have, been, approved, by, the, fda, for, use, in, treating, minor, wounds, and, burns, honey, has, long, been, used, as, a, topical, antibiotic, by, practitioners, of, traditional, and, herbal, medicine, honey, s, antibacterial, effects, were, first, demonstrated, by, the, dutch, scientist, bernardus, adrianus, van, ketel, in, 1892, since, then, numerous, studies, have, shown, that, honey, has, broad, spectrum, antibacterial, activity, against, gram, positive, and, gram, negative, bacteria, although, potency, varies, widely, between, different, honeys, due, to, the, proliferation, of, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, in, the, last, few, decades, there, has, been, renewed, interest, in, researching, the, antibacterial, properties, of, honey, components, of, honey, under, preliminary, research, for, potential, antibiotic, use, include, methylglyoxal, hydrogen, peroxide, and, royalisin, also, called, defensin, 1, for, chronic, and, acute, coughs, a, cochrane, review, found, no, strong, evidence, for, or, against, the, use, of, honey, for, treating, children, the, systematic, review, concluded, with, moderate, to, low, evidence, that, honey, helps, more, than, no, treatment, diphenhydramine, and, placebo, at, giving, relief, from, coughing, honey, does, not, appear, to, work, better, than, dextromethorphan, at, relieving, coughing, in, children, other, reviews, have, also, supported, the, use, of, honey, for, treating, children, the, uk, medicines, and, healthcare, products, regulatory, agency, recommends, avoiding, giving, over, the, counter, cough, and, common, cold, medication, to, children, under, six, and, suggests, a, homemade, remedy, containing, honey, and, lemon, is, likely, to, be, just, as, useful, and, safer, to, take, but, warns, that, honey, should, not, be, given, to, babies, because, of, the, risk, of, infant, botulism, the, world, health, organization, recommends, honey, as, a, treatment, for, coughs, and, sore, throats, including, for, children, stating, that, no, reason, exists, to, believe, it, is, less, effective, than, a, commercial, remedy, the, use, of, honey, has, been, recommended, as, a, temporary, intervention, for, known, or, suspected, button, cell, battery, ingestions, to, reduce, the, risk, and, severity, of, injury, to, the, esophagus, caused, by, the, battery, prior, to, its, removal, there, is, no, evidence, that, honey, is, beneficial, for, treating, cancer, although, honey, may, be, useful, for, controlling, side, effects, of, radiation, therapy, or, chemotherapy, used, to, treat, cancer, consumption, is, sometimes, advocated, as, a, treatment, for, seasonal, allergies, due, to, pollen, but, scientific, evidence, to, support, the, claim, is, inconclusive, honey, is, generally, considered, ineffective, for, the, treatment, of, allergic, conjunctivitis, the, majority, of, calories, in, honey, are, from, fructose, when, consumed, in, addition, to, a, normal, diet, fructose, causes, significant, weight, gain, but, when, fructose, was, substituted, for, other, carbohydrates, of, equal, energy, value, there, was, no, effect, on, body, weight, honey, has, a, mild, laxative, effect, which, has, been, noted, as, being, helpful, in, alleviating, constipation, and, bloating, honey, is, generally, safe, when, taken, in, typical, food, amounts, but, it, may, have, various, potential, adverse, effects, or, interactions, in, combination, with, excessive, consumption, existing, disease, conditions, or, drugs, included, among, these, are, mild, reactions, to, high, intake, such, as, anxiety, insomnia, or, hyperactivity, in, about, 10, of, children, according, to, one, study, no, symptoms, of, anxiety, insomnia, or, hyperactivity, were, detected, with, honey, consumption, compared, to, placebo, according, to, another, study, honey, consumption, may, interact, adversely, with, existing, allergies, high, blood, sugar, levels, as, in, diabetes, or, anticoagulants, used, to, control, bleeding, among, other, clinical, conditions, people, who, have, a, weakened, immune, system, may, be, at, risk, of, bacterial, or, fungal, infection, from, eating, honey, infants, can, develop, botulism, after, consuming, honey, contaminated, with, clostridium, botulinum, endospores, infantile, botulism, shows, geographical, variation, in, the, uk, only, six, cases, were, reported, between, 1976, and, 2006, yet, the, us, has, much, higher, rates, 1, 9, per, 100, 000, live, births, 47, 2, of, which, are, in, california, while, the, risk, honey, poses, to, infant, health, is, small, taking, the, risk, is, not, recommended, until, after, one, year, of, age, and, then, giving, honey, is, considered, safe, mad, honey, intoxication, is, a, result, of, eating, honey, containing, grayanotoxins, honey, produced, from, flowers, of, rhododendrons, mountain, laurels, sheep, laurel, and, azaleas, may, cause, honey, intoxication, symptoms, include, dizziness, weakness, excessive, perspiration, nausea, and, vomiting, less, commonly, low, blood, pressure, shock, heart, rhythm, irregularities, and, convulsions, may, occur, with, rare, cases, resulting, in, death, according, to, the, fda, honey, intoxication, is, more, likely, when, using, natural, unprocessed, honey, from, farmers, who, may, have, a, small, number, of, hives, because, commercial, processing, which, pools, of, honey, from, numerous, sources, dilutes, the, toxins, toxic, honey, may, also, result, when, bees, are, proximate, to, tutu, bushes, coriaria, arborea, and, the, vine, hopper, insect, scolypopa, australis, both, are, found, throughout, new, zealand, bees, gather, honeydew, produced, by, the, vine, hopper, insects, feeding, on, the, tutu, plant, this, introduces, the, poison, tutin, into, honey, only, a, few, areas, in, new, zealand, the, coromandel, peninsula, eastern, bay, of, plenty, region, and, the, marlborough, sounds, frequently, produce, toxic, honey, symptoms, of, tutin, poisoning, include, vomiting, delirium, giddiness, increased, excitability, stupor, coma, and, violent, convulsions, to, reduce, the, risk, of, tutin, poisoning, humans, should, not, eat, honey, taken, from, feral, hives, in, the, risk, areas, of, new, zealand, since, december, 2001, new, zealand, beekeepers, have, been, required, to, reduce, the, risk, of, producing, toxic, honey, by, closely, monitoring, tutu, vine, hopper, and, foraging, conditions, within, 3, km, 2, mi, of, their, apiary, intoxication, is, rarely, dangerous, in, myths, and, folk, medicine, honey, was, used, both, orally, and, topically, to, treat, various, ailments, including, gastric, disturbances, ulcers, skin, wounds, and, skin, burns, by, ancient, greeks, and, egyptians, and, in, ayurveda, and, traditional, chinese, medicine, honey, collection, is, an, ancient, activity, long, preceding, the, honey, bee, s, domestication, this, traditional, practice, is, known, as, honey, hunting, a, mesolithic, rock, painting, in, a, cave, in, valencia, spain, dating, back, at, least, 8, 000, years, depicts, two, honey, foragers, collecting, honey, and, honeycomb, from, a, wild, bees, nest, the, figures, are, depicted, carrying, baskets, or, gourds, and, using, a, ladder, or, series, of, ropes, to, reach, the, nest, humans, followed, the, greater, honeyguide, bird, to, wild, beehives, this, behavior, may, have, evolved, with, early, hominids, the, oldest, known, honey, remains, were, found, in, georgia, during, the, construction, of, the, baku, tbilisi, ceyhan, pipeline, archaeologists, found, honey, remains, on, the, inner, surface, of, clay, vessels, unearthed, in, an, ancient, tomb, dating, back, between, 4, 700, and, 5, 500, years, in, ancient, georgia, several, types, of, honey, were, buried, with, a, person, for, journeys, into, the, afterlife, including, linden, berry, and, meadow, flower, varieties, the, first, written, records, of, beekeeping, are, from, ancient, egypt, where, honey, was, used, to, sweeten, cakes, biscuits, and, other, foods, and, as, a, base, for, unguents, in, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, dead, were, often, buried, in, or, with, honey, in, egypt, mesopotamia, and, other, regions, bees, were, kept, at, temples, to, produce, honey, for, temple, offerings, mummification, and, other, uses, in, ancient, greece, honey, was, produced, from, the, archaic, to, the, hellenistic, periods, in, 594, bce, beekeeping, around, athens, was, so, widespread, that, solon, passed, a, law, about, it, he, who, sets, up, hives, of, bees, must, put, them, 300, feet, away, from, those, already, installed, by, another, greek, archaeological, excavations, of, pottery, located, ancient, hives, according, to, columella, greek, beekeepers, of, the, hellenistic, period, did, not, hesitate, to, move, their, hives, over, rather, long, distances, to, maximize, production, taking, advantage, of, the, different, vegetative, cycles, in, different, regions, the, spiritual, and, supposed, therapeutic, use, of, honey, in, ancient, india, was, documented, in, both, the, vedas, and, the, ayurveda, texts, in, ancient, greek, religion, the, food, of, zeus, and, the, twelve, gods, of, olympus, was, honey, in, the, form, of, nectar, and, ambrosia, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, promised, land, canaan, the, land, of, israel, is, described, 16, times, as, the, land, of, milk, and, honey, as, a, metaphor, for, its, bounty, god, promises, such, a, land, to, the, israelites, exodus, 3, 8, and, the, spies, sent, in, by, moses, confirm, that, the, land, fits, the, description, numbers, 13, 27, the, word, honey, appears, for, a, further, 39, times, outside, the, above, mentioned, phrase, in, the, book, of, judges, samson, finds, a, swarm, of, bees, and, honey, in, the, carcass, of, a, lion, judges, 14, 8, biblical, law, covered, offerings, made, in, the, temple, to, god, the, book, of, leviticus, says, that, every, grain, offering, you, bring, to, the, lord, must, be, made, without, yeast, for, you, are, not, to, burn, any, yeast, or, honey, in, a, food, offering, presented, to, the, lord, lev, 2, 11, in, the, books, of, samuel, jonathan, is, forced, into, a, confrontation, with, his, father, king, saul, after, eating, honey, in, violation, of, a, rash, oath, saul, has, made, 1, samuel, 14, 24, 47, proverbs, 16, 24, in, the, jps, tanakh, 1917, version, says, pleasant, words, are, as, a, honeycomb, sweet, to, the, soul, and, health, to, the, bones, the, book, of, proverbs, says, eat, honey, my, son, for, it, is, good, prov, 24, 13, but, also, it, is, not, good, to, eat, much, honey, prov, 25, 27, of, the, 55, times, the, word, honey, appears, in, the, hebrew, bible, 16, are, part, of, the, expression, the, land, of, milk, and, honey, and, only, twice, is, honey, explicitly, associated, with, bees, both, being, related, to, wild, bees, samson, collecting, bees, honey, from, inside, a, lion, s, corpse, judges, 14, 8, 9, is, the, first, instance, with, jonathan, king, saul, s, son, tasting, from, a, honeycomb, after, the, battle, of, michmash, 1, samuel, 14, 27, being, the, second, modern, biblical, researchers, long, considered, that, the, original, hebrew, word, used, in, the, bible, devash, refers, to, the, sweet, syrup, produced, from, figs, or, dates, because, the, domestication, of, the, honey, bee, was, completely, undocumented, through, archaeology, anywhere, in, the, ancient, near, east, excluding, egypt, at, the, time, associated, with, the, earlier, biblical, narratives, books, of, exodus, judges, kings, etc, in, 2005, however, an, apiary, dating, from, the, 10th, century, bc, was, found, in, tel, rehov, israel, that, contained, 100, hives, estimated, to, produce, half, a, ton, of, honey, annually, this, was, as, of, 2007, the, only, such, finding, made, by, archaeologists, in, the, entire, ancient, near, east, region, and, it, opens, the, possibility, that, biblical, honey, was, indeed, bee, honey, in, jewish, tradition, honey, is, a, symbol, for, the, new, year, rosh, hashanah, at, the, traditional, meal, for, that, holiday, apple, slices, are, dipped, in, honey, and, eaten, to, bring, a, sweet, new, year, some, rosh, hashanah, greetings, show, honey, and, an, apple, symbolizing, the, feast, in, some, congregations, small, straws, of, honey, are, given, out, to, usher, in, the, new, year, pure, honey, is, considered, kosher, permitted, to, be, eaten, by, religious, jews, though, it, is, produced, by, a, flying, insect, a, non, kosher, creature, eating, other, products, of, non, kosher, animals, is, forbidden, it, belongs, among, the, parve, neutral, foods, containing, neither, meat, nor, dairy, products, and, allowed, to, be, eaten, together, with, either, the, christian, new, testament, says, that, john, the, baptist, lived,
