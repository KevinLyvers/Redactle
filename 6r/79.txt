cooking, also, known, as, cookery, or, professionally, as, the, culinary, arts, is, the, art, science, and, craft, of, using, heat, to, make, food, more, palatable, digestible, nutritious, or, safe, cooking, techniques, and, ingredients, vary, widely, from, grilling, food, over, an, open, fire, to, using, electric, stoves, to, baking, in, various, types, of, ovens, reflecting, local, conditions, cooking, is, an, aspect, of, all, human, societies, and, a, cultural, universal, types, of, cooking, also, depend, on, the, skill, levels, and, training, of, the, cooks, cooking, is, done, both, by, people, in, their, own, dwellings, and, by, professional, cooks, and, chefs, in, restaurants, and, other, food, establishments, preparing, food, with, heat, or, fire, is, an, activity, unique, to, humans, archeological, evidence, of, cooking, fires, from, at, least, 300, 000, years, ago, exists, but, some, estimate, that, humans, started, cooking, up, to, 2, million, years, ago, the, expansion, of, agriculture, commerce, trade, and, transportation, between, civilizations, in, different, regions, offered, cooks, many, new, ingredients, new, inventions, and, technologies, such, as, the, invention, of, pottery, for, holding, and, boiling, of, water, expanded, cooking, techniques, some, modern, cooks, apply, advanced, scientific, techniques, to, food, preparation, to, further, enhance, the, flavor, of, the, dish, served, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, that, early, hominids, may, have, adopted, cooking, 1, million, to, 2, million, years, ago, re, analysis, of, burnt, bone, fragments, and, plant, ashes, from, the, wonderwerk, cave, in, south, africa, has, provided, evidence, supporting, control, of, fire, by, early, humans, by, 1, million, years, ago, in, his, seminal, work, catching, fire, how, cooking, made, us, human, richard, wrangham, suggested, that, evolution, of, bipedalism, and, a, large, cranial, capacity, meant, that, early, homo, habilis, regularly, cooked, food, however, unequivocal, evidence, in, the, archaeological, record, for, the, controlled, use, of, fire, begins, at, 400, 000, bce, long, after, homo, erectus, archaeological, evidence, from, 300, 000, years, ago, in, the, form, of, ancient, hearths, earth, ovens, burnt, animal, bones, and, flint, are, found, across, europe, and, the, middle, east, the, oldest, evidence, via, heated, fish, teeth, from, a, deep, cave, of, controlled, use, of, fire, to, cook, food, by, archaic, humans, was, dated, to, 780, 000, years, ago, anthropologists, think, that, widespread, cooking, fires, began, about, 250, 000, years, ago, when, hearths, first, appeared, recently, the, earliest, hearths, have, been, reported, to, be, at, least, 790, 000, years, old, communication, between, the, old, world, and, the, new, world, in, the, columbian, exchange, influenced, the, history, of, cooking, the, movement, of, foods, across, the, atlantic, from, the, new, world, such, as, potatoes, tomatoes, maize, beans, bell, pepper, chili, pepper, vanilla, pumpkin, cassava, avocado, peanut, pecan, cashew, pineapple, blueberry, sunflower, chocolate, gourds, green, beans, and, squash, had, a, profound, effect, on, old, world, cooking, the, movement, of, foods, across, the, atlantic, from, the, old, world, such, as, cattle, sheep, pigs, wheat, oats, barley, rice, apples, pears, peas, chickpeas, mustard, and, carrots, similarly, changed, new, world, cooking, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, food, was, a, classic, marker, of, identity, in, europe, in, the, 19th, century, age, of, nationalism, cuisine, became, a, defining, symbol, of, national, identity, the, industrial, revolution, brought, mass, production, mass, marketing, and, standardization, of, food, factories, processed, preserved, canned, and, packaged, a, wide, variety, of, foods, and, processed, cereals, quickly, became, a, defining, feature, of, the, american, breakfast, in, the, 1920, s, freezing, methods, cafeterias, and, fast, food, restaurants, emerged, most, ingredients, in, cooking, are, derived, from, living, organisms, vegetables, fruits, grains, and, nuts, as, well, as, herbs, and, spices, come, from, plants, while, meat, eggs, and, dairy, products, come, from, animals, mushrooms, and, the, yeast, used, in, baking, are, kinds, of, fungi, cooks, also, use, water, and, minerals, such, as, salt, cooks, can, also, use, wine, or, spirits, naturally, occurring, ingredients, contain, various, amounts, of, molecules, called, proteins, carbohydrates, and, fats, they, also, contain, water, and, minerals, cooking, involves, a, manipulation, of, the, chemical, properties, of, these, molecules, carbohydrates, include, the, common, sugar, sucrose, table, sugar, a, disaccharide, and, such, simple, sugars, as, glucose, made, by, enzymatic, splitting, of, sucrose, and, fructose, from, fruit, and, starches, from, sources, such, as, cereal, flour, rice, arrowroot, and, potato, the, interaction, of, heat, and, carbohydrate, is, complex, long, chain, sugars, such, as, starch, tend, to, break, down, into, more, digestible, simpler, sugars, if, the, sugars, are, heated, so, that, all, water, of, crystallisation, is, driven, off, caramelization, starts, with, the, sugar, undergoing, thermal, decomposition, with, the, formation, of, carbon, and, other, breakdown, products, producing, caramel, similarly, the, heating, of, sugars, and, proteins, causes, the, maillard, reaction, a, basic, flavor, enhancing, technique, an, emulsion, of, starch, with, fat, or, water, can, when, gently, heated, provide, thickening, to, the, dish, being, cooked, in, european, cooking, a, mixture, of, butter, and, flour, called, a, roux, is, used, to, thicken, liquids, to, make, stews, or, sauces, in, asian, cooking, a, similar, effect, is, obtained, from, a, mixture, of, rice, or, corn, starch, and, water, these, techniques, rely, on, the, properties, of, starches, to, create, simpler, mucilaginous, saccharides, during, cooking, which, causes, the, familiar, thickening, of, sauces, this, thickening, will, break, down, however, under, additional, heat, types, of, fat, include, vegetable, oils, animal, products, such, as, butter, and, lard, as, well, as, fats, from, grains, including, maize, and, flax, oils, fats, are, used, in, a, number, of, ways, in, cooking, and, baking, to, prepare, stir, fries, grilled, cheese, or, pancakes, the, pan, or, griddle, is, often, coated, with, fat, or, oil, fats, are, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, baked, goods, such, as, cookies, cakes, and, pies, fats, can, reach, temperatures, higher, than, the, boiling, point, of, water, and, are, often, used, to, conduct, high, heat, to, other, ingredients, such, as, in, frying, deep, frying, or, saut, ing, fats, are, used, to, add, flavor, to, food, e, g, butter, or, bacon, fat, prevent, food, from, sticking, to, pans, and, create, a, desirable, texture, fats, are, one, of, the, three, main, macronutrient, groups, in, human, diet, along, with, carbohydrates, and, proteins, and, the, main, components, of, common, food, products, like, milk, butter, tallow, lard, salt, pork, and, cooking, oils, they, are, a, major, and, dense, source, of, food, energy, for, many, animals, and, play, important, structural, and, metabolic, functions, in, most, living, beings, including, energy, storage, waterproofing, and, thermal, insulation, the, human, body, can, produce, the, fat, it, requires, from, other, food, ingredients, except, for, a, few, essential, fatty, acids, that, must, be, included, in, the, diet, dietary, fats, are, also, the, carriers, of, some, flavor, and, aroma, ingredients, and, vitamins, that, are, not, water, soluble, edible, animal, material, including, muscle, offal, milk, eggs, and, egg, whites, contains, substantial, amounts, of, protein, almost, all, vegetable, matter, in, particular, legumes, and, seeds, also, includes, proteins, although, generally, in, smaller, amounts, mushrooms, have, high, protein, content, any, of, these, may, be, sources, of, essential, amino, acids, when, proteins, are, heated, they, become, denatured, unfolded, and, change, texture, in, many, cases, this, causes, the, structure, of, the, material, to, become, softer, or, more, friable, meat, becomes, cooked, and, is, more, friable, and, less, flexible, in, some, cases, proteins, can, form, more, rigid, structures, such, as, the, coagulation, of, albumen, in, egg, whites, the, formation, of, a, relatively, rigid, but, flexible, matrix, from, egg, white, provides, an, important, component, in, baking, cakes, and, also, underpins, many, desserts, based, on, meringue, cooking, often, involves, water, and, water, based, liquids, these, can, be, added, in, order, to, immerse, the, substances, being, cooked, this, is, typically, done, with, water, stock, or, wine, alternatively, the, foods, themselves, can, release, water, a, favorite, method, of, adding, flavor, to, dishes, is, to, save, the, liquid, for, use, in, other, recipes, liquids, are, so, important, to, cooking, that, the, name, of, the, cooking, method, used, is, often, based, on, how, the, liquid, is, combined, with, the, food, as, in, steaming, simmering, boiling, braising, and, blanching, heating, liquid, in, an, open, container, results, in, rapidly, increased, evaporation, which, concentrates, the, remaining, flavor, and, ingredients, this, is, a, critical, component, of, both, stewing, and, sauce, making, vitamins, and, minerals, are, required, for, normal, metabolism, and, what, the, body, cannot, manufacture, itself, must, come, from, external, sources, vitamins, come, from, several, sources, including, fresh, fruit, and, vegetables, vitamin, c, carrots, liver, vitamin, a, cereal, bran, bread, liver, b, vitamins, fish, liver, oil, vitamin, d, and, fresh, green, vegetables, vitamin, k, many, minerals, are, also, essential, in, small, quantities, including, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, and, sulfur, and, in, very, small, quantities, copper, zinc, and, selenium, the, micronutrients, minerals, and, vitamins, in, fruit, and, vegetables, may, be, destroyed, or, eluted, by, cooking, vitamin, c, is, especially, prone, to, oxidation, during, cooking, and, may, be, completely, destroyed, by, protracted, cooking, the, bioavailability, of, some, vitamins, such, as, thiamin, vitamin, b6, niacin, folate, and, carotenoids, are, increased, with, cooking, by, being, freed, from, the, food, microstructure, blanching, or, steaming, vegetables, is, a, way, of, minimizing, vitamin, and, mineral, loss, in, cooking, there, are, many, methods, of, cooking, most, of, which, have, been, known, since, antiquity, these, include, baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming, and, braising, a, more, recent, innovation, is, microwaving, various, methods, use, differing, levels, of, heat, and, moisture, and, vary, in, cooking, time, the, method, chosen, greatly, affects, the, result, some, major, hot, cooking, techniques, include, as, of, 2021, over, 2, 6, billion, people, cook, using, open, fires, or, inefficient, stoves, using, kerosene, biomass, and, coal, as, fuel, these, cooking, practices, use, fuels, and, technologies, that, produce, high, levels, of, household, air, pollution, causing, 3, 8, million, premature, deaths, annually, of, these, deaths, 27, are, from, pneumonia, 27, from, ischaemic, heart, disease, 20, from, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, 18, from, stroke, and, 8, from, lung, cancer, women, and, young, children, are, disproportionately, affected, since, they, spend, the, most, time, near, the, hearth, hazards, while, cooking, can, include, to, prevent, those, injuries, there, are, protections, such, as, cooking, clothing, anti, slip, shoes, fire, extinguisher, and, more, cooking, can, prevent, many, foodborne, illnesses, that, would, otherwise, occur, if, raw, food, is, consumed, when, heat, is, used, in, the, preparation, of, food, it, can, kill, or, inactivate, harmful, organisms, such, as, bacteria, and, viruses, as, well, as, various, parasites, such, as, tapeworms, and, toxoplasma, gondii, food, poisoning, and, other, illness, from, uncooked, or, poorly, prepared, food, may, be, caused, by, bacteria, such, as, pathogenic, strains, of, escherichia, coli, salmonella, typhimurium, and, campylobacter, viruses, such, as, noroviruses, and, protozoa, such, as, entamoeba, histolytica, bacteria, viruses, and, parasites, may, be, introduced, through, salad, meat, that, is, uncooked, or, done, rare, and, unboiled, water, the, sterilizing, effect, of, cooking, depends, on, temperature, cooking, time, and, technique, used, some, food, spoilage, bacteria, such, as, clostridium, botulinum, or, bacillus, cereus, can, form, spores, that, survive, cooking, or, boiling, which, then, germinate, and, regrow, after, the, food, has, cooled, this, makes, it, unsafe, to, reheat, cooked, food, more, than, once, cooking, increases, the, digestibility, of, many, foods, which, are, inedible, or, poisonous, when, raw, for, example, raw, cereal, grains, are, hard, to, digest, while, kidney, beans, are, toxic, when, raw, or, improperly, cooked, due, to, the, presence, of, phytohaemagglutinin, which, is, inactivated, by, cooking, for, at, least, ten, minutes, at, 100, c, 212, f, food, safety, depends, on, the, safe, preparation, handling, and, storage, of, food, food, spoilage, bacteria, proliferate, in, the, danger, zone, temperature, range, from, 40, to, 140, f, 4, to, 60, c, food, therefore, should, not, be, stored, in, this, temperature, range, washing, of, hands, and, surfaces, especially, when, handling, different, meats, and, keeping, raw, food, separate, from, cooked, food, to, avoid, cross, contamination, are, good, practices, in, food, preparation, foods, prepared, on, plastic, cutting, boards, may, be, less, likely, to, harbor, bacteria, than, wooden, ones, washing, and, disinfecting, cutting, boards, especially, after, use, with, raw, meat, poultry, or, seafood, reduces, the, risk, of, contamination, proponents, of, raw, foodism, argue, that, cooking, food, increases, the, risk, of, some, of, the, detrimental, effects, on, food, or, health, they, point, out, that, during, cooking, of, vegetables, and, fruit, containing, vitamin, c, the, vitamin, elutes, into, the, cooking, water, and, becomes, degraded, through, oxidation, peeling, vegetables, can, also, substantially, reduce, the, vitamin, c, content, especially, in, the, case, of, potatoes, where, most, vitamin, c, is, in, the, skin, however, research, has, shown, that, in, the, specific, case, of, carotenoids, a, greater, proportion, is, absorbed, from, cooked, vegetables, than, from, raw, vegetables, sulforaphane, a, glucosinolate, breakdown, product, is, present, in, vegetables, such, as, broccoli, and, is, mostly, destroyed, when, the, vegetable, is, boiled, although, there, has, been, some, basic, research, on, how, sulforaphane, might, exert, beneficial, effects, in, vivo, there, is, no, high, quality, evidence, for, its, efficacy, against, human, diseases, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, has, studied, retention, data, for, 16, vitamins, 8, minerals, and, alcohol, for, approximately, 290, foods, across, various, cooking, methods, in, a, human, epidemiological, analysis, by, richard, doll, and, richard, peto, in, 1981, diet, was, estimated, to, cause, a, large, percentage, of, cancers, studies, suggest, that, around, 32, of, cancer, deaths, may, be, avoidable, by, changes, to, the, diet, some, of, these, cancers, may, be, caused, by, carcinogens, in, food, generated, during, the, cooking, process, although, it, is, often, difficult, to, identify, the, specific, components, in, diet, that, serve, to, increase, cancer, risk, several, studies, published, since, 1990, indicate, that, cooking, meat, at, high, temperature, creates, heterocyclic, amines, hca, s, which, are, thought, to, increase, cancer, risk, in, humans, researchers, at, the, national, cancer, institute, found, that, human, subjects, who, ate, beef, rare, or, medium, rare, had, less, than, one, third, the, risk, of, stomach, cancer, than, those, who, ate, beef, medium, well, or, well, done, while, avoiding, meat, or, eating, meat, raw, may, be, the, only, ways, to, avoid, hca, s, in, meat, fully, the, national, cancer, institute, states, that, cooking, meat, below, 212, f, 100, c, creates, negligible, amounts, of, hca, s, also, microwaving, meat, before, cooking, may, reduce, hcas, by, 90, by, reducing, the, time, needed, for, the, meat, to, be, cooked, at, high, heat, nitrosamines, are, found, in, some, food, and, may, be, produced, by, some, cooking, processes, from, proteins, or, from, nitrites, used, as, food, preservatives, cured, meat, such, as, bacon, has, been, found, to, be, carcinogenic, with, links, to, colon, cancer, ascorbate, which, is, added, to, cured, meat, however, reduces, nitrosamine, formation, baking, grilling, or, broiling, food, especially, starchy, foods, until, a, toasted, crust, is, formed, generates, significant, concentrations, of, acrylamide, this, discovery, in, 2002, led, to, international, health, concerns, subsequent, research, has, however, found, that, it, is, not, likely, that, the, acrylamides, in, burnt, or, well, cooked, food, cause, cancer, in, humans, cancer, research, uk, categorizes, the, idea, that, burnt, food, causes, cancer, as, a, myth, the, scientific, study, of, cooking, has, become, known, as, molecular, gastronomy, this, is, a, subdiscipline, of, food, science, concerning, the, physical, and, chemical, transformations, that, occur, during, cooking, important, contributions, have, been, made, by, scientists, chefs, and, authors, such, as, herv, this, chemist, nicholas, kurti, physicist, peter, barham, physicist, harold, mcgee, author, shirley, corriher, biochemist, author, robert, wolke, chemist, author, it, is, different, for, the, application, of, scientific, knowledge, to, cooking, that, is, molecular, cooking, for, the, technique, or, molecular, cuisine, for, a, culinary, style, for, which, chefs, such, as, raymond, blanc, philippe, and, christian, conticini, ferran, adria, heston, blumenthal, pierre, gagnaire, chef, chemical, processes, central, to, cooking, include, hydrolysis, in, particular, beta, elimination, of, pectins, during, the, thermal, treatment, of, plant, tissues, pyrolysis, and, glycation, reactions, wrongly, named, maillard, reactions, cooking, foods, with, heat, depends, on, many, factors, the, specific, heat, of, an, object, thermal, conductivity, and, perhaps, most, significantly, the, difference, in, temperature, between, the, two, objects, thermal, diffusivity, is, the, combination, of, specific, heat, conductivity, and, density, that, determines, how, long, it, will, take, for, the, food, to, reach, a, certain, temperature, home, cooking, has, traditionally, been, a, process, carried, out, informally, in, a, home, or, around, a, communal, fire, and, can, be, enjoyed, by, all, members, of, the, family, although, in, many, cultures, women, bear, primary, responsibility, cooking, is, also, often, carried, out, outside, of, personal, quarters, for, example, at, restaurants, or, schools, bakeries, were, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, cooking, outside, the, home, and, bakeries, in, the, past, often, offered, the, cooking, of, pots, of, food, provided, by, their, customers, as, an, additional, service, in, the, present, day, factory, food, preparation, has, become, common, with, many, ready, to, eat, as, well, as, ready, to, cook, foods, being, prepared, and, cooked, in, factories, and, home, cooks, using, a, mixture, of, scratch, made, and, factory, made, foods, together, to, make, a, meal, the, nutritional, value, of, including, more, commercially, prepared, foods, has, been, found, to, be, inferior, to, home, made, foods, home, cooked, meals, tend, to, be, healthier, with, fewer, calories, and, less, saturated, fat, cholesterol, and, sodium, on, a, per, calorie, basis, while, providing, more, fiber, calcium, and, iron, the, ingredients, are, also, directly, sourced, so, there, is, control, over, authenticity, taste, and, nutritional, value, the, superior, nutritional, quality, of, home, cooking, could, therefore, play, a, role, in, preventing, chronic, disease, cohort, studies, following, the, elderly, over, 10, years, show, that, adults, who, cook, their, own, meals, have, significantly, lower, mortality, even, when, controlling, for, confounding, variables, home, cooking, may, be, associated, with, comfort, food, and, some, commercially, produced, foods, and, restaurant, meals, are, presented, through, advertising, or, packaging, as, having, been, home, cooked, regardless, of, their, actual, origin, this, trend, began, in, the, 1920, s, and, is, attributed, to, people, in, urban, areas, of, the, u, s, wanting, homestyle, food, even, though, their, schedules, and, smaller, kitchens, made, cooking, harder
