fundoshi, in, the, united, kingdom, until, the, mid, 19th, century, there, was, no, law, against, nude, swimming, and, each, town, was, free, to, make, its, own, laws, for, example, the, bath, corporation, official, bathing, dress, code, of, 1737, prescribed, for, men, it, is, ordered, established, and, decreed, by, this, corporation, that, no, male, person, above, the, age, of, ten, years,

protested, against, them, and, wanted, to, remain, in, the, nude, francis, kilvert, described, men, s, bathing, suits, coming, into, use, in, the, 1870s, as, a, pair, of, very, short, red, and, white, striped, drawers, female, bathing, costumes, were, derived, from, those, worn, at, bath, and, other, spas, it, would, appear, that, until, the, 1670s, nude, female, bathing, in, the, spas, was, the, norm, and, that, after, that, time, women, bathed, clothed, celia, fiennes, gave, a, detailed, description, of, the, standard, ladies, bathing, costume, in, 1687, the, ladyes, go, into, the, bath, with, garments, made, of, a, fine, yellow, canvas, which, is, stiff, and, made, large, with, great, sleeves, like, a, parson, s, gown, the, water, fills, it, up, so, that, it, is, borne, off, that, your, shape, is, not, seen, it, does, not, cling, close, as, other, linning, which, lookes, sadly, in, the, poorer, sort, that, go, in, their, own, linning, the, gentlemen, have, drawers, and, wastcoates, of, the, same, sort, of, canvas, this, is, the, best, linning, for, the, bath, water, will, change, any, other, yellow, the, bath, corporation, official, bathing, dress, code, of, 1737, prescribed, for, women, no, female, person, shall, at, any, time, hereafter, go, into, a, bath, or, baths, within, this, city, by, day, or, by, night, without, a, decent, shift, on, their, bodies, the, expedition, of, humphry, clinker, was, published, in, 1771, and, its, description, of, ladies, bathing, costume, is, different, from, that, of, celia, fiennes, a, hundred, years, earlier, the, ladies, wear, jackets, and, petticoats, of, brown, linen, with, chip, hats, in, which, they, fix, their, handkerchiefs, to, wipe, the, sweat, from, their, faces, but, truly, whether, it, is, owing, to, the, steam, that, surrounds, them, or, the, heat, of, the, water, or, the, nature, of, the, dress, or, to, all, these, causes, together, they, look, so, flushed, and, so, frightful, that, i, always, turn, my, eyes, another, way, penelope, byrde, points, out, that, smollett, s, description, may, not, be, accurate, for, he, describes, a, two, piece, costume, not, the, one, piece, shift, or, smock, that, most, people, describe, and, is, depicted, in, contemporary, prints, his, description, does, however, tally, with, elizabeth, grant, s, description, of, the, guide, s, costume, at, ramsgate, in, 1811, the, only, difference, is, in, the, fabric, the, costumes, are, made, of, flannel, however, was, a, common, fabric, for, sea, bathing, costumes, as, many, believed, the, warmer, fabric, was, necessary, in, cold, water, in, the, 18th, century, women, wore, bathing, gowns, in, the, water, these, were, long, dresses, of, fabrics, that, would, not, become, transparent, when, wet, with, weights, sewn, into, the, hems, so, that, they, would, not, rise, up, in, the, water, the, men, s, swim, suit, a, rather, form, fitting, wool, garment, with, long, sleeves, and, legs, similar, to, long, underwear, was, developed, and, would, change, little, for, a, century, in, the, 19th, century, the, woman, s, double, suit, was, common, comprising, a, gown, from, shoulder, to, knees,

style, of, swimsuit, in, the, 1920s, and, became, the, focus, of, censorship, efforts, despite, opposition, from, some, groups, the, form, fitting, style, proved, popular, it, was, not, long, before, swimwear, started, to, shrink, further, at, first, arms, were, exposed, and, then, legs, up, to, mid, thigh, necklines, receded, from, around, the, neck, down, to, around, the, top, of, the, bosom,
