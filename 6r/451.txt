golf, is, a, club, and, ball, sport, in, which, players, use, various, clubs, to, hit, a, ball, into, a, series, of, holes, on, a, course, in, as, few, strokes, as, possible, golf, unlike, most, ball, games, cannot, and, does, not, use, a, standardized, playing, area, and, coping, with, the, varied, terrains, encountered, on, different, courses, is, a, key, part, of, the, game, courses, typically, have, either, 9, or, 18, holes, regions, of, terrain, that, each, contain, a, cup, the, hole, that, receives, the, ball, each, hole, on, a, course, has, a, teeing, ground, for, the, hole, s, first, stroke, and, a, putting, green, containing, the, cup, there, are, several, standard, forms, of, terrain, between, the, tee, and, the, green, such, as, the, fairway, rough, tall, grass, and, various, hazards, that, may, be, water, rocks, or, sand, filled, bunkers, each, hole, on, a, course, is, unique, in, its, specific, layout, many, golf, courses, are, designed, to, resemble, their, native, landscape, such, as, along, a, sea, coast, where, the, course, is, called, a, links, within, a, forest, among, rolling, hills, or, part, of, a, desert, golf, is, played, for, the, lowest, number, of, strokes, by, an, individual, known, as, stroke, play, or, the, lowest, score, on, the, most, individual, holes, in, a, complete, round, by, an, individual, or, team, known, as, match, play, stroke, play, is, the, most, commonly, seen, format, at, all, levels, especially, at, the, elite, level, the, modern, game, of, golf, originated, in, 15th, century, scotland, the, 18, hole, round, was, created, at, the, old, course, at, st, andrews, in, 1764, golf, s, first, major, and, the, world, s, oldest, golf, tournament, is, the, open, championship, also, known, as, the, open, which, was, first, played, in, 1860, at, the, prestwick, golf, club, in, ayrshire, scotland, this, is, one, of, the, four, major, championships, in, men, s, professional, golf, the, other, three, being, played, in, the, united, states, the, masters, the, u, s, open, and, the, pga, championship, while, the, modern, game, of, golf, originated, in, 15th, century, scotland, the, game, s, ancient, origins, are, unclear, and, much, debated, some, historians, trace, the, sport, back, to, the, roman, game, of, paganica, in, which, participants, used, a, bent, stick, to, hit, a, stuffed, leather, ball, one, theory, asserts, that, paganica, spread, throughout, europe, as, the, romans, conquered, most, of, the, continent, during, the, first, century, bc, and, eventually, evolved, into, the, modern, game, others, cite, chuiwan, chui, means, striking, and, wan, means, small, ball, as, the, progenitor, a, chinese, game, played, between, the, eighth, and, fourteenth, centuries, a, ming, dynasty, scroll, by, the, artist, youqiu, dating, back, to, 1368, entitled, the, autumn, banquet, shows, a, member, of, the, chinese, imperial, court, swinging, what, appears, to, be, a, golf, club, at, a, small, ball, with, the, aim, of, sinking, it, into, a, hole, the, game, is, thought, to, have, been, introduced, into, europe, during, the, middle, ages, another, early, game, that, resembled, modern, golf, was, known, as, cambuca, in, england, and, chambot, in, france, the, persian, game, chowkan, is, another, possible, ancient, origin, albeit, being, more, polo, like, in, addition, kolven, a, game, involving, a, ball, and, curved, bats, was, played, annually, in, loenen, netherlands, beginning, in, 1297, to, commemorate, the, capture, of, the, assassin, of, floris, v, a, year, earlier, the, modern, game, originated, in, scotland, where, the, first, written, record, of, golf, is, james, ii, s, banning, of, the, game, in, 1457, as, an, unwelcome, distraction, to, learning, archery, james, iv, lifted, the, ban, in, 1502, when, he, became, a, golfer, himself, with, golf, clubs, first, recorded, in, 1503, 1504, for, golf, clubbes, and, balles, to, the, king, that, he, playit, with, to, many, golfers, the, old, course, at, st, andrews, a, links, course, dating, to, before, 1574, is, considered, to, be, a, site, of, pilgrimage, in, 1764, the, standard, 18, hole, golf, course, was, created, at, st, andrews, when, members, modified, the, course, from, 22, to, 18, holes, golf, is, documented, as, being, played, on, musselburgh, links, east, lothian, scotland, as, early, as, 2, march, 1672, which, is, certified, as, the, oldest, golf, course, in, the, world, by, guinness, world, records, the, oldest, surviving, rules, of, golf, were, compiled, in, march, 1744, for, the, company, of, gentlemen, golfers, later, renamed, the, honourable, company, of, edinburgh, golfers, which, was, played, at, leith, scotland, the, world, s, oldest, golf, tournament, in, existence, and, golf, s, first, major, is, the, open, championship, which, was, first, played, on, 17, october, 1860, at, prestwick, golf, club, in, ayrshire, scotland, with, scottish, golfers, winning, the, earliest, majors, two, scotsmen, from, dunfermline, john, reid, and, robert, lockhart, first, demonstrated, golf, in, the, u, s, by, setting, up, a, hole, in, an, orchard, in, 1888, with, reid, setting, up, america, s, first, golf, club, the, same, year, saint, andrew, s, golf, club, in, yonkers, new, york, a, golf, course, consists, of, either, 9, or, 18, holes, each, with, a, teeing, ground, or, tee, box, that, is, set, off, by, two, markers, showing, the, bounds, of, the, legal, tee, area, fairway, rough, and, other, hazards, and, the, putting, green, surrounded, by, the, fringe, with, the, pin, normally, a, flagstick, and, cup, the, levels, of, grass, are, varied, to, increase, difficulty, or, to, allow, for, putting, in, the, case, of, the, green, while, many, holes, are, designed, with, a, direct, line, of, sight, from, the, teeing, area, to, the, green, some, holes, may, bend, either, to, the, left, or, to, the, right, this, is, commonly, called, a, dogleg, in, reference, to, a, dog, s, knee, the, hole, is, called, a, dogleg, left, if, the, hole, angles, leftwards, and, dogleg, right, if, it, bends, right, sometimes, a, hole, s, direction, may, bend, twice, this, is, called, a, double, dogleg, a, regular, golf, course, consists, of, 18, holes, but, nine, hole, courses, are, common, and, can, be, played, twice, through, for, a, full, round, of, 18, holes, early, scottish, golf, courses, were, primarily, laid, out, on, links, land, soil, covered, sand, dunes, directly, inland, from, beaches, the, word, links, derives, from, the, scots, language, and, the, old, english, word, hlinc, rising, ground, ridge, traditionally, these, are, coastal, sand, dunes, but, sometimes, open, parkland, this, gave, rise, to, the, term, golf, links, particularly, applied, to, seaside, courses, and, those, built, on, naturally, sandy, soil, inland, the, first, 18, hole, golf, course, in, the, united, states, was, on, a, sheep, farm, in, downers, grove, illinois, in, 1892, the, course, is, still, there, today, every, round, of, golf, is, based, on, playing, a, number, of, holes, in, a, given, order, a, round, typically, consists, of, 18, holes, that, are, played, in, the, order, determined, by, the, course, layout, each, hole, is, played, once, in, the, round, on, a, standard, course, of, 18, holes, the, game, can, be, played, by, any, number, of, people, although, a, typical, group, will, have, 1, 4, people, playing, the, round, the, typical, amount, of, time, required, for, pace, of, play, is, about, two, hours, for, a, 9, hole, round, and, four, hours, for, an, 18, hole, round, playing, a, hole, on, a, golf, course, is, initiated, by, putting, a, ball, into, play, by, striking, it, with, a, club, on, the, teeing, ground, also, called, the, tee, box, or, simply, the, tee, for, this, first, shot, on, each, hole, it, is, allowed, but, not, required, for, the, golfer, to, place, the, ball, on, a, tee, prior, to, striking, it, a, tee, is, a, small, peg, that, can, be, used, to, elevate, the, ball, slightly, above, the, ground, up, to, a, few, centimetres, high, tees, are, commonly, made, of, wood, but, may, be, constructed, of, any, material, including, plastic, traditionally, golfers, used, mounds, of, sand, to, elevate, the, ball, and, containers, of, sand, were, provided, for, the, purpose, a, few, courses, still, require, sand, to, be, used, instead, of, peg, tees, to, reduce, litter, and, reduce, damage, to, the, teeing, ground, tees, help, reduce, the, interference, of, the, ground, or, grass, on, the, movement, of, the, club, making, the, ball, easier, to, hit, by, elevating, the, ball, from, the, playing, surface, when, the, initial, shot, on, a, hole, is, intended, to, move, the, ball, a, long, distance, typically, more, than, 225, yards, 210, m, the, shot, is, commonly, called, a, drive, and, is, generally, made, with, a, long, shafted, large, headed, wood, club, called, a, driver, shorter, holes, may, be, initiated, with, other, clubs, such, as, higher, numbered, woods, or, irons, once, the, ball, comes, to, rest, the, golfer, strikes, it, again, as, many, times, as, necessary, using, shots, that, are, variously, known, as, a, lay, up, an, approach, a, pitch, or, a, chip, until, the, ball, reaches, the, green, where, the, golfer, then, putts, the, ball, into, the, hole, commonly, called, sinking, the, putt, or, holing, out, the, goal, of, getting, the, ball, into, the, hole, holing, the, ball, in, as, few, strokes, as, possible, may, be, impeded, by, obstacles, such, as, areas, of, longer, grass, called, rough, usually, found, alongside, fairways, which, both, slows, any, ball, that, contacts, it, and, makes, it, harder, to, advance, a, ball, that, has, stopped, on, it, doglegs, which, are, changes, in, the, direction, of, the, fairway, that, often, require, shorter, shots, to, play, around, them, bunkers, or, sand, traps, and, water, hazards, such, as, ponds, or, streams, in, stroke, play, competitions, each, player, plays, their, ball, until, it, is, holed, no, matter, how, many, strokes, that, may, take, in, match, play, it, is, acceptable, to, simply, pick, up, one, s, ball, and, surrender, the, hole, after, enough, strokes, have, been, made, by, a, player, that, it, is, mathematically, impossible, for, the, player, to, win, the, hole, it, is, also, acceptable, in, informal, stroke, play, to, surrender, the, hole, after, hitting, three, strokes, more, than, the, par, rating, of, the, hole, a, triple, bogey, see, below, while, technically, a, violation, of, rule, 3, 2, this, practice, speeds, play, as, a, courtesy, to, others, and, avoids, runaway, scores, and, excessive, frustration, alternatively, in, competition, the, committee, may, designate, a, maximum, score, possible, for, a, hole, for, the, same, reasons, while, formalizing, the, surrender, or, pick, up, rule, the, total, distance, from, the, first, teeing, ground, to, the, 18th, green, can, be, quite, long, total, yardages, through, the, green, can, be, in, excess, of, 7, 000, yards, 6, 400, m, and, when, adding, in, the, travel, distance, between, the, green, of, one, hole, and, the, tee, of, the, next, even, skilled, players, may, easily, travel, 5, miles, 8, 0, km, or, more, during, a, round, at, some, courses, gas, or, electric, golf, carts, are, used, to, travel, between, shots, which, can, speed, up, play, and, allows, participation, by, individuals, unable, to, walk, a, whole, round, on, other, courses, players, generally, walk, the, course, either, carrying, their, bag, using, a, shoulder, strap, or, using, a, golf, trolley, for, their, bag, these, trolleys, may, or, may, not, be, battery, assisted, at, many, amateur, tournaments, including, u, s, high, school, and, college, play, players, are, required, to, walk, and, to, carry, their, own, bags, but, at, the, professional, and, top, amateur, level, as, well, as, at, high, level, private, clubs, players, may, be, accompanied, by, caddies, who, carry, and, manage, the, players, equipment, and, who, are, allowed, by, the, rules, to, give, advice, on, the, play, of, the, course, the, rules, of, golf, are, internationally, standardised, and, are, jointly, governed, by, the, r, a, spun, off, in, 2004, from, the, royal, and, ancient, golf, club, of, st, andrews, founded, 1754, and, the, united, states, golf, association, usga, with, the, aim, of, simplifying, the, rules, in, 2017, the, usga, and, r, a, undertook, a, complete, rewrite, the, new, rule, book, came, into, effect, in, january, 2019, the, underlying, principle, of, the, rules, is, fairness, as, stated, on, the, back, cover, of, the, official, rule, book, there, are, strict, regulations, regarding, the, amateur, status, of, golfers, essentially, anybody, who, has, ever, received, payment, or, compensation, for, giving, instruction, or, played, golf, for, money, is, not, considered, an, amateur, and, may, not, participate, in, competitions, limited, solely, to, amateurs, however, amateur, golfers, may, receive, expenses, that, comply, with, strict, guidelines, and, they, may, accept, non, cash, prizes, within, the, limits, established, by, the, rules, of, amateur, status, in, addition, to, the, officially, printed, rules, golfers, also, abide, by, a, set, of, guidelines, called, golf, etiquette, etiquette, guidelines, cover, matters, such, as, safety, fairness, pace, of, play, and, a, player, s, obligation, to, contribute, to, the, care, of, the, course, though, there, are, no, penalties, for, breach, of, etiquette, rules, players, generally, follow, the, rules, of, golf, etiquette, in, an, effort, to, improve, everyone, s, playing, experience, penalty, strokes, are, incurred, in, certain, situations, and, are, counted, towards, a, player, s, score, as, if, there, were, extra, swing, s, at, the, ball, either, one, or, two, strokes, are, added, for, most, rule, infractions, or, for, taking, relief, from, various, situations, with, the, general, penalty, defined, as, two, strokes, and, disqualification, for, severe, or, repeated, rule, breaches, examples, include, golf, clubs, are, used, to, hit, a, golf, ball, each, club, is, composed, of, a, shaft, with, a, lance, or, grip, on, the, top, end, and, a, club, head, on, the, bottom, long, clubs, which, have, a, lower, amount, of, degree, loft, are, those, meant, to, propel, the, ball, a, comparatively, longer, distance, and, short, clubs, a, higher, degree, of, loft, and, a, comparatively, shorter, distance, the, actual, physical, length, of, each, club, is, longer, or, shorter, depending, on, the, distance, the, club, is, intended, to, propel, the, ball, golf, clubs, have, traditionally, been, arranged, into, three, basic, types, woods, are, large, headed, long, shafted, clubs, meant, to, propel, the, ball, a, long, distance, from, relatively, open, lies, such, as, the, teeing, ground, and, fairway, of, particular, importance, is, the, driver, or, 1, wood, which, is, the, lowest, lofted, wood, club, and, in, modern, times, has, become, highly, specialized, for, making, extremely, long, distance, tee, shots, up, to, 300, yards, 270, m, or, more, in, a, professional, golfer, s, hands, traditionally, these, clubs, had, heads, made, of, a, hardwood, hence, the, name, but, virtually, all, modern, woods, are, now, made, of, metal, such, as, titanium, or, of, composite, materials, irons, are, shorter, shafted, clubs, with, a, metal, head, primarily, consisting, of, a, flat, angled, striking, face, traditionally, the, clubhead, was, forged, from, iron, modern, iron, clubheads, are, investment, cast, from, a, steel, alloy, irons, of, varying, loft, are, used, for, a, variety, of, shots, from, virtually, anywhere, on, the, course, but, most, often, for, shorter, distance, shots, approaching, the, green, or, to, get, the, ball, out, of, tricky, lies, such, as, sand, traps, the, third, class, is, the, putter, which, evolved, from, the, irons, to, create, a, low, lofted, balanced, club, designed, to, roll, the, ball, along, the, green, and, into, the, hole, putters, are, virtually, always, used, on, the, green, or, in, the, surrounding, rough, fringe, a, fourth, class, called, hybrids, evolved, as, a, cross, between, woods, and, irons, and, are, typically, seen, replacing, the, low, lofted, irons, with, a, club, that, provides, similar, distance, but, a, higher, launch, angle, and, a, more, forgiving, nature, a, maximum, of, 14, clubs, is, allowed, in, a, player, s, bag, at, one, time, during, a, stipulated, round, the, choice, of, clubs, is, at, the, golfer, s, discretion, although, every, club, must, be, constructed, in, accordance, with, parameters, outlined, in, the, rules, clubs, that, meet, these, parameters, are, usually, called, conforming, violation, of, these, rules, can, result, in, disqualification, the, exact, shot, hit, at, any, given, time, on, a, golf, course, and, which, club, is, used, to, accomplish, the, shot, are, always, completely, at, the, discretion, of, the, golfer, in, other, words, there, is, no, restriction, whatsoever, on, which, club, a, golfer, may, or, may, not, use, at, any, time, for, any, shot, golf, balls, are, spherical, usually, white, although, other, colours, are, allowed, and, minutely, pock, marked, by, dimples, that, decrease, aerodynamic, drag, by, increasing, air, turbulence, around, the, ball, in, motion, which, delays, boundary, layer, separation, and, reduces, the, drag, inducing, wake, behind, the, ball, thereby, allowing, the, ball, to, fly, farther, the, combination, of, a, soft, boundary, layer, and, a, hard, core, enables, both, distance, and, spin, a, tee, is, allowed, only, for, the, first, stroke, on, each, hole, unless, the, player, must, hit, a, provisional, tee, shot, or, replay, their, first, shot, from, the, tee, many, golfers, wear, golf, shoes, with, metal, or, plastic, spikes, designed, to, increase, traction, thus, allowing, for, longer, and, more, accurate, shots, a, golf, bag, is, used, to, transport, golf, clubs, and, the, player, s, other, or, personal, equipment, golf, bags, have, several, pockets, designed, for, carrying, equipment, and, supplies, such, as, tees, balls, and, gloves, golf, bags, can, be, carried, pulled, on, a, trolley, or, harnessed, to, a, motorized, golf, cart, during, play, golf, bags, usually, have, both, a, hand, strap, and, shoulder, strap, for, carrying, others, may, be, carried, over, both, shoulders, like, a, backpack, and, often, bags, have, retractable, legs, that, allow, the, bag, to, stand, upright, when, at, rest, the, golf, swing, is, outwardly, similar, to, many, other, motions, involving, swinging, a, tool, or, playing, implement, such, as, an, axe, or, a, baseball, bat, however, unlike, many, of, these, motions, the, result, of, the, swing, is, highly, dependent, on, several, sub, motions, being, properly, aligned, and, timed, these, ensure, that, the, club, travels, up, to, the, ball, in, line, with, the, desired, path, that, the, clubface, is, in, line, with, the, swing, path, and, that, the, ball, hits, the, centre, or, sweet, spot, of, the, clubface, the, ability, to, do, this, consistently, across, a, complete, set, of, clubs, with, a, wide, range, of, shaft, lengths, and, clubface, areas, is, a, key, skill, for, any, golfer, and, takes, a, significant, effort, to, achieve, stance, refers, to, how, the, golfer, positions, themselves, in, order, to, play, a, stroke, it, is, fundamentally, important, in, being, able, to, play, a, stroke, effectively, the, stance, adopted, is, determined, by, what, stroke, is, being, played, all, stances, involve, a, slight, crouch, this, allows, for, a, more, efficient, striking, posture, whilst, also, isometrically, preloading, the, muscles, of, the, legs, and, core, this, allows, the, stroke, to, be, played, more, dynamically, and, with, a, greater, level, of, overall, control, when, adopting, their, stance, golfers, start, with, the, non, dominant, side, of, the, body, facing, the, target, for, a, right, hander, the, target, is, to, their, left, setting, the, stance, in, regard, to, the, position, of, the, ball, and, placing, the, clubhead, behind, the, ball, is, known, as, being, at, address, when, in, this, position, the, player, s, body, and, the, centerline, of, the, club, face, are, positioned, parallel, to, the, desired, line, of, travel, with, the, feet, either, perpendicular, to, that, line, or, slightly, splayed, outward, the, feet, are, commonly, shoulder, width, apart, for, middle, irons, and, putters, narrower, for, short, irons, and, wider, for, long, irons, and, woods, the, ball, is, typically, positioned, more, to, the, front, of, the, player, s, stance, closer, to, the, leading, foot, for, lower, lofted, clubs, with, the, usual, ball, position, for, a, drive, being, just, behind, the, arch, of, the, leading, foot, the, ball, is, placed, further, back, in, the, player, s, stance, toward, the, trailing, foot, as, the, loft, of, the, club, to, be, used, increases, most, iron, shots, and, putts, are, made, with, the, ball, roughly, centered, in, the, stance, while, a, few, mid, and, short, iron, shots, are, made, with, the, ball, slightly, behind, the, centre, of, the, stance, to, ensure, consistent, contact, between, the, ball, and, clubface, so, the, ball, is, on, its, way, before, the, club, continues, down, into, the, turf, the, golfer, chooses, a, golf, club, grip, and, stroke, appropriate, to, the, distance, having, chosen, a, club, and, stroke, to, produce, the, desired, distance, the, player, addresses, the, ball, by, taking, their, stance, to, the, side, of, it, and, except, when, the, ball, lies, in, a, hazard, grounding, the, club, behind, the, ball, the, golfer, then, takes, their, backswing, rotating, the, club, their, arms, and, their, upper, body, away, from, the, ball, and, then, begins, their, swing, bringing, the, clubhead, back, down, and, around, to, hit, the, ball, a, proper, golf, swing, is, a, complex, combination, of, motions, and, slight, variations, in, posture, or, positioning, can, make, a, great, deal, of, difference, in, how, well, the, ball, is, hit, and, how, straight, it, travels, the, general, goal, of, a, player, making, a, full, swing, is, to, propel, the, clubhead, as, fast, as, possible, while, maintaining, a, single, plane, of, motion, of, the, club, and, clubhead, to, send, the, clubhead, into, the, ball, along, the, desired, path, of, travel, and, with, the, clubhead, also, pointing, that, direction, accuracy, and, consistency, are, typically, stressed, over, pure, distance, a, player, with, a, straight, drive, that, travels, only, 220, yards, 200, m, will, nevertheless, be, able, to, accurately, place, the, ball, into, a, favourable, lie, on, the, fairway, and, can, make, up, for, the, lesser, distance, of, any, given, club, by, simply, using, more, club, a, lower, loft, on, their, tee, shot, or, on, subsequent, fairway, and, approach, shots, however, a, golfer, with, a, drive, that, may, go, 280, yards, 260, m, but, often, does, not, fly, straight, will, be, less, able, to, position, their, ball, advantageously, the, ball, may, hook, pull, draw, fade, push, or, slice, off, the, intended, line, and, land, out, of, bounds, or, in, the, rough, or, hazards, and, thus, the, player, will, require, many, more, strokes, to, hole, out, a, golf, stroke, uses, the, muscles, of, the, core, especially, erector, spinae, muscles, and, latissimus, dorsi, muscle, when, turning, hamstring, shoulder, and, wrist, stronger, muscles, in, the, wrist, can, prevent, them, from, being, twisted, during, swings, whilst, stronger, shoulders, increase, the, turning, force, weak, wrists, can, also, transmit, the, force, to, elbows, and, even, neck, and, lead, to, injury, when, a, muscle, contracts, it, pulls, equally, from, both, ends, and, to, have, movement, at, only, one, end, of, the, muscle, other, muscles, must, come, into, play, to, stabilize, the, bone, to, which, the, other, end, of, the, muscle, is, attached, golf, is, a, unilateral, exercise, that, can, break, body, balances, requiring, exercises, to, keep, the, balance, in, muscles, putting, is, considered, to, be, the, most, important, component, of, the, game, of, golf, as, the, game, of, golf, has, evolved, there, have, been, many, different, putting, techniques, and, grips, that, have, been, devised, to, give, golfers, the, best, chance, to, make, putts, when, the, game, originated, golfers, would, putt, with, their, dominant, hand, on, the, bottom, of, the, grip, and, their, weak, hand, on, top, of, the, grip, this, grip, and, putting, style, is, known, as, conventional, there, are, many, variations, of, conventional, including, overlap, where, the, golfer, overlaps, the, off, hand, index, finger, onto, off, the, dominant, pinky, interlock, where, the, offhand, index, finger, interlocks, with, the, dominant, pinky, and, ring, finger, double, or, triple, overlap, and, so, on, recently, cross, handed, putting, has, become, a, popular, trend, amongst, professional, golfers, and, amateurs, cross, handed, putting, is, the, idea, that, the, dominant, hand, is, on, top, of, the, grip, where, the, weak, hand, is, on, the, bottom, this, grip, restricts, the, motion, in, your, dominant, hand, and, eliminates, the, possibility, of, wrist, breakdowns, through, the, putting, stroke, other, notable, putting, styles, include, the, claw, a, style, that, has, the, grip, directly, in, between, the, thumb, and, index, finger, of, the, dominant, hand, while, the, palm, faces, the, target, the, weak, hand, placed, normally, on, the, putter, anchored, putting, a, style, that, requires, a, longer, putter, shaft, that, can, be, anchored, into, the, player, s, stomach, or, below, the, chin, the, idea, is, to, stabilize, one, end, of, the, putter, thus, creating, a, more, consistent, pendulum, stroke, this, style, has, been, banned, on, professional, circuits, since, 2016, a, hole, is, classified, by, its, par, which, gives, an, indication, of, the, number, of, strokes, a, skilled, golfer, may, be, expected, to, need, to, complete, play, of, the, hole, the, primary, factor, for, classifying, the, par, of, a, relatively, straight, hazard, free, hole, is, the, distance, from, the, tee, to, the, green, and, calculates, the, number, of, strokes, a, skilled, golfer, is, expected, to, require, to, reach, the, green, with, an, additional, allowance, of, 2, putts, as, such, the, minimum, par, of, any, hole, is, 3, one, stroke, for, the, tee, shot, and, two, putts, par, 3, 4, and, 5, holes, are, commonplace, on, golf, courses, far, more, rarely, courses, may, feature, par, 6, and, even, par, 7, holes, for, men, a, typical, par, 3, hole, is, less, than, 250, yards, 230, m, in, length, with, a, par, 4, hole, ranging, between, 251, 450, yards, 230, 411, m, and, a, par, 5, hole, being, longer, than, 450, yards, 410, m, for, women, these, boundaries, are, lower, and, for, professionals, they, are, much, increased, the, rare, par, 6s, can, stretch, well, over, 650, yards, 590, m, these, distances, are, based, on, the, typical, scratch, golfer, s, drive, distance, of, between, 240, and, 280, yards, 220, and, 260, m, although, length, is, the, primary, factor, in, calculating, par, other, factors, are, taken, into, account, however, the, number, of, strokes, a, scratch, golfer, should, take, to, make, the, green, remains, foremost, factors, affecting, the, calculation, include, altitude, gradient, of, the, land, from, the, tee, to, green, and, forced, lay, ups, due, to, dog, legs, sharp, bends, or, obstacles, e, g, bunkers, water, hazards, getting, the, ball, onto, the, green, in, two, strokes, less, than, par, and, hence, meeting, the, par, calculation, criteria, is, called, making, green, in, regulation, or, gir, missing, a, gir, does, not, necessarily, mean, a, golfer, will, not, make, par, but, it, does, make, doing, so, more, difficult, as, it, reduces, the, number, of, putts, available, conversely, making, a, gir, does, not, guarantee, a, par, as, the, player, might, require, three, or, more, putts, to, hole, out, professional, golfers, typically, make, between, 60, and, 70, of, greens, in, regulation, eighteen, hole, courses, typically, total, to, an, overall, par, score, of, 70, to, 72, for, a, complete, round, with, most, holes, having, a, par, of, 4, and, a, smaller, number, of, par, 3, and, par, 5, holes, additionally, courses, may, be, classified, according, to, their, play, difficulty, which, may, be, used, to, calculate, a, golfer, s, handicap, the, two, primary, difficulty, ratings, in, the, u, s, are, the, course, rating, which, is, the, expected, score, for, a, zero, handicap, scratch, golfer, and, the, slope, rating, which, is, a, measure, of, how, much, worse, a, bogey, golfer, handicap, around, 20, would, be, expected, to, play, than, a, scratch, golfer, relative, to, their, handicap, the, goal, is, to, play, as, few, strokes, per, round, as, possible, a, golfer, s, number, of, strokes, in, a, hole, course, or, tournament, is, compared, to, its, respective, par, score, and, is, then, reported, either, as, the, number, that, the, golfer, was, under, or, over, par, or, if, it, was, equal, to, par, a, hole, in, one, or, an, ace, occurs, when, a, golfer, sinks, their, ball, into, the, cup, with, their, first, stroke, from, the, tee, common, scores, for, a, hole, also, have, specific, terms, in, a, typical, professional, tournament, or, among, scratch, amateur, players, birdie, bogey, play, is, common, a, player, will, lose, a, stroke, by, bogeying, a, hole, then, gain, one, by, scoring, a, birdie, eagles, are, uncommon, but, not, rare, however, only, 18, players, have, scored, an, albatross, in, a, men, s, major, championship, one, of, the, rarest, feats, in, golf, is, the, condor, which, has, never, occurred, in, a, professional, tournament, only, five, condors, have, been, verified, to, have, ever, occurred, although, none, of, the, courses, involved, were, professionally, accredited, there, are, two, basic, forms, of, golf, play, match, play, and, stroke, play, stroke, play, is, more, popular, two, players, or, two, teams, play, each, hole, as, a, separate, contest, against, each, other, in, what, is, called, match, play, the, party, with, the, lower, score, wins, that, hole, or, if, the, scores, of, both, players, or, teams, are, equal, the, hole, is, halved, or, tied, the, game, is, won, by, the, party, that, wins, more, holes, than, the, other, in, the, case, that, one, team, or, player, has, taken, a, lead, that, cannot, be, overcome, in, the, number, of, holes, remaining, to, be, played, the, match, is, deemed, to, be, won, by, the, party, in, the, lead, and, the, remainder, of, the, holes, are, not, played, for, example, if, one, party, already, has, a, lead, of, six, holes, and, only, five, holes, remain, to, be, played, on, the, course, the, match, is, over, and, the, winning, party, is, deemed, to, have, won, 6, 5, at, any, given, point, if, the, lead, is, equal, to, the, number, of, holes, remaining, the, party, leading, the, match, is, said, to, be, dormie, and, the, match, is, continued, until, the, party, increases, the, lead, by, one, hole, or, ties, any, of, the, remaining, holes, thereby, winning, the, match, or, until, the, match, ends, in, a, tie, with, the, lead, player, s, opponent, winning, all, remaining, holes, when, the, game, is, tied, after, the, predetermined, number, of, holes, have, been, played, it, may, be, continued, until, one, side, takes, a, one, hole, lead, the, score, achieved, for, each, and, every, hole, of, the, round, or, tournament, is, added, to, produce, the, total, score, and, the, player, with, the, lowest, score, wins, in, stroke, play, stroke, play, is, the, game, most, commonly, played, by, professional, golfers, if, there, is, a, tie, after, the, regulation, number, of, holes, in, a, professional, tournament, a, playoff, takes, place, between, all, tied, players, playoffs, either, are, sudden, death, or, employ, a, pre, determined, number, of, holes, anywhere, from, three, to, a, full, 18, in, sudden, death, a, player, who, scores, lower, on, a, hole, than, all, of, their, opponents, wins, the, match, if, at, least, two, players, remain, tied, after, such, a, playoff, using, a, pre, determined, number, of, holes, then, play, continues, in, sudden, death, format, where, the, first, player, to, win, a, hole, wins, the, tournament, there, are, many, variations, in, scoring, and, playing, formats, in, the, game, of, golf, some, officially, defined, in, the, rules, of, golf, variations, include, the, popular, stableford, scoring, system, and, various, team, formats, some, common, and, popular, examples, are, listed, below, there, are, also, variations, on, the, usual, starting, procedure, where, everyone, begins, from, the, first, tee, and, plays, all, holes, in, order, through, to, the, eighteenth, in, large, field, tournaments, especially, on, professional, tours, a, two, tee, start, is, commonplace, where, the, field, will, be, split, between, starting, on, the, first, tee, and, the, tenth, tee, sometimes, the, eighth, or, eleventh, depending, on, proximity, to, the, clubhouse, shotgun, starts, are, mainly, used, for, amateur, tournament, or, society, play, in, this, variant, each, of, the, groups, playing, starts, their, game, on, a, different, hole, allowing, for, all, players, to, start, and, end, their, round, at, roughly, the, same, time, for, example, a, group, starting, on, hole, 5, will, play, through, to, the, 18th, hole, and, continue, with, hole, 1, ending, their, round, on, hole, 4, a, bogey, or, par, competition, is, a, scoring, format, sometimes, seen, in, informal, tournaments, its, scoring, is, similar, to, match, play, except, each, player, compares, their, hole, score, to, the, hole, s, par, rating, instead, of, the, score, of, another, player, the, player, wins, the, hole, if, they, score, a, birdie, or, better, they, lose, the, hole, if, they, score, a, bogey, or, worse, and, they, halve, the, hole, by, scoring, par, by, recording, only, this, simple, win, loss, halve, score, on, the, sheet, a, player, can, shrug, off, a, very, poorly, played, hole, with, a, simple, mark, and, move, on, as, used, in, competitions, the, player, or, pair, with, the, best, win, loss, differential, wins, the, competition, the, stableford, system, is, a, simplification, of, stroke, play, that, awards, players, points, based, on, their, score, relative, to, the, hole, s, par, the, score, for, a, hole, is, calculated, by, taking, the, par, score, adding, 2, then, subtracting, the, player, s, hole, score, making, the, result, zero, if, negative, alternately, stated, a, double, bogey, or, worse, is, zero, points, a, bogey, is, worth, one, point, par, is, two, a, birdie, three, an, eagle, four, and, so, on, the, advantages, of, this, system, over, stroke, play, are, a, more, natural, higher, is, better, scoring, the, ability, to, compare, stableford, scores, between, plays, on, courses, with, different, total, par, scores, scoring, an, even, in, stroke, play, will, always, give, a, stableford, score, of, 36, discouraging, the, tendency, to, abandon, the, entire, game, after, playing, a, particularly, bad, hole, a, novice, playing, by, strict, rules, may, score, as, high, as, an, 8, or, 10, on, a, single, difficult, hole, their, stableford, score, for, the, hole, would, be, zero, which, puts, them, only, two, points, behind, par, no, matter, how, badly, they, played, and, the, ability, to, simply, pick, up, one, s, ball, once, it, is, impossible, to, score, any, points, for, the, hole, which, speeds, play, the, usga, and, r, a, sanction, a, modified, stableford, system, for, scratch, players, which, makes, par, worth, zero, a, birdie, worth, 2, eagle, 5, and, double, eagle, 8, while, a, bogey, is, a, penalty, of, 1, and, a, double, bogey, or, worse, 3, as, with, the, original, system, the, highest, score, wins, the, game, and, terrible, scores, on, one, or, two, holes, will, not, ruin, a, player, s, overall, score, but, this, system, rewards, bogey, birdie, play, more, than, the, original, encouraging, golfers, to, try, to, make, riskier, birdie, putt, or, eagle, chipshots, instead, of, simply, parring, each, hole, a, handicap, is, a, numerical, measure, of, a, golfer, s, potential, scoring, ability, over, 18, holes, it, is, used, to, enable, players, of, widely, varying, abilities, to, compete, against, one, another, better, players, are, those, with, the, lowest, handicaps, and, someone, with, a, handicap, of, 0, or, less, is, often, referred, to, as, a, scratch, golfer, handicap, systems, vary, throughout, the, world, and, use, different, methods, to, assess, courses, and, calculate, handicaps, in, order, to, address, difficulties, in, translating, between, these, systems, the, usga, and, the, r, a, working, with, the, various, existing, handicapping, authorities, devised, a, new, world, handicap, system, which, was, introduced, globally, starting, in, 2020, golf, courses, are, assessed, and, rated, according, to, the, average, good, score, of, a, scratch, golfer, taking, into, account, a, multitude, of, factors, affecting, play, such, as, length, obstacles, undulations, etc, a, player, s, handicap, gives, an, indication, of, the, number, of, strokes, above, this, course, rating, that, the, player, will, make, over, the, course, of, an, average, best, round, of, golf, i, e, scoring, near, their, potential, above, average, lower, handicap, players, are, generally, the, most, consistent, so, can, be, expected, to, play, to, this, standard, or, better, more, often, than, higher, handicappers, some, handicap, systems, also, account, for, differences, in, scoring, difficulty, between, low, and, high, handicap, golfer, they, do, this, by, means, of, assessing, and, rating, courses, according, to, the, average, good, score, of, a, bogey, golfer, a, player, with, a, handicap, of, around, 20, this, is, used, with, the, course, rating, to, calculate, a, slope, rating, which, is, used, to, adjust, golfer, s, handicap, to, produce, a, playing, handicap, for, the, course, and, set, of, tees, being, used, handicap, systems, have, potential, for, abuse, by, players, who, may, intentionally, play, badly, to, increase, their, handicap, sandbagging, before, playing, to, their, potential, at, an, important, event, with, a, valuable, prize, for, this, reason, handicaps, are, not, used, in, professional, golf, but, they, can, still, be, calculated, and, used, along, with, other, criteria, to, determine, the, relative, strengths, of, various, professional, players, touring, professionals, being, the, best, of, the, best, have, negative, handicaps, they, can, be, expected, more, often, than, not, to, score, lower, than, the, course, rating, on, any, course, in, 2005, golf, digest, calculated, that, the, countries, with, the, most, golf, courses, per, capita, in, order, were, scotland, new, zealand, australia, ireland, canada, wales, the, united, states, sweden, and, england, countries, with, fewer, than, 500, 000, people, were, excluded, the, number, of, courses, in, other, territories, has, increased, an, example, of, this, being, the, expansion, of, golf, in, china, the, first, golf, course, in, china, opened, in, 1984, but, by, the, end, of, 2009, there, were, roughly, 600, golf, courses, in, china, for, much, of, the, 21st, century, the, development, of, new, golf, courses, in, china, has, been, officially, banned, with, the, exception, of, the, island, province, of, hainan, but, the, number, of, courses, had, nonetheless, tripled, from, 2004, to, 2009, the, ban, has, been, evaded, with, the, government, s, tacit, approval, simply, by, not, mentioning, golf, in, any, development, plans, in, the, united, states, women, made, up, 25, percent, of, golfers, in, 2021, which, was, up, from, 19, percent, since, 2011, and, junior, female, golfers, account, for, 35, percent, or, 1, 1, million, golfers, in, the, united, states, the, number, of, people, who, play, golf, twenty, five, times, or, more, per, year, decreased, from, 6, 9, million, in, 2000, to, 4, 6, million, in, 2005, according, to, the, national, golf, foundation, the, ngf, reported, that, the, number, who, played, golf, at, all, decreased, from, 30, to, 26, million, over, the, same, period, in, february, 1971, astronaut, alan, shepard, became, the, first, person, to, golf, anywhere, other, than, on, earth, he, smuggled, a, golf, club, head, and, two, golf, balls, on, board, apollo, 14, in, order, to, play, golf, on, the, moon, he, attached, the, head, to, a, tool, for, collecting, rock, samples, and, attempted, two, drives, he, shanked, the, first, attempt,

or, teaching, professionals, pros, and, only, compete, in, local, competitions, a, small, elite, of, professional, golfers, are, tournament, pros, who, compete, full, time, on, international, tours, many, club, and, teaching, professionals, working, in, the, golf, industry, start, as, caddies, or, with, a, general, interest, in, the, game, finding, employment, at, golf, courses, and, eventually, moving, on, to, certifications, in, their, chosen, profession, these, programs, include, independent, institutions, and, universities, and, those, that, eventually, lead, to, a, class, a, golf, professional, certification, touring, professionals, typically, start, as, amateur, players, who, attain, their, pro, status, after, success, in, major, tournaments, that, win, them, either, prize, money, and, or, notice, from, corporate, sponsors, jack, nicklaus, for, example, gained, widespread, notice, by, finishing, second, in, the, 1960, u, s, open, to, champion, arnold, palmer, with, a, 72, hole, score, of, 282, the, best, score, to, date, in, that, tournament, by, an, amateur, he, played, one, more, amateur, year, in, 1961, winning, that, year, s, u, s, amateur, before, turning,

but, also, knowledge, of, the, rules, and, etiquette, of, the, game, in, some, countries, golf, instruction, is, best, performed, by, teachers, certified, by, the, professional, golfers, association, some, top, instructors, who, work, with, professional, golfers, have, become, quite, well, known, in, their, own, right, professional, golf, instructors, can, use, physical, conditioning, mental,

is, responsible, for, arranging, events, finding, sponsors, and, regulating, the, tour, typically, a, tour, has, members, who, are, entitled, to, compete, in, most, of, its, events, and, also, invites, non, members, to, compete, in, some, of, them, gaining, membership, of, an, elite, tour, is, highly, competitive, and, most, professional, golfers, never, achieve, it, perhaps, the, most, widely, known, tour, is, the, pga, tour, which, tends, to, attract, the, strongest, fields, outside, the, four, majors, and, the, four, world, golf, championships, events, this, is, due, mostly, to, the, fact, that, most, pga, tour, events, have, a, first, prize, of, at, least, 800, 000, usd, the, european, tour, which, attracts, a, substantial, number, of, top, golfers, from, outside, north, america, ranks, second, to, the, pga, tour, in, worldwide, prestige, some, top, professionals, from, outside, north, america, play, enough, tournaments, to, maintain, membership, on, both, the, pga, tour, and, european, tour, since, 2010, both, tours, money, titles, have, been, claimed, by, the, same, individual, three, times, with, luke, donald, doing, so, in, 2011, and, rory, mcilroy, in, 2012, and, 2014, in, 2013, henrik, stenson, won, the, fedex, cup, points, race, on, the, pga, tour, and, the, european, tour, money, title, but, did, not, top, the, pga, tour, money, list, that, honour,
