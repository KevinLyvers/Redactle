an, arcade, game, or, coin, op, game, is, a, coin, operated, entertainment, machine, typically, installed, in, public, businesses, such, as, restaurants, bars, and, amusement, arcades, most, arcade, games, are, presented, as, primarily, games, of, skill, and, include, arcade, video, games, pinball, machines, electro, mechanical, games, redemption, games, or, merchandisers, broadly, arcade, games, are, nearly, always, considered, games, of, skill, with, only, some, elements, of, games, of, chance, games, that, are, solely, games, of, chance, like, slot, machines, and, pachinko, often, are, categorized, legally, as, gambling, devices, and, due, to, restrictions, may, not, be, made, available, to, minors, or, without, appropriate, oversight, in, many, jurisdictions, arcade, video, games, were, first, introduced, in, the, early, 1970s, with, pong, as, the, first, commercially, successful, game, arcade, video, games, use, electronic, or, computerized, circuitry, to, take, input, from, the, player, and, translate, that, to, an, electronic, display, such, as, a, monitor, or, television, set, coin, op, carnival, games, are, automated, versions, or, variations, of, popular, staffed, games, held, at, carnival, midways, most, of, these, are, played, for, prizes, or, tickets, for, redemption, common, examples, include, skee, ball, and, whac, a, mole, electro, mechanical, games, em, games, operate, on, a, combination, of, some, electronic, circuitry, and, mechanical, actions, from, the, player, to, move, items, contained, within, the, game, s, cabinet, some, of, these, were, early, light, gun, games, using, light, sensitive, sensors, on, targets, to, register, hits, examples, of, electro, mechanical, games, include, periscope, and, rifleman, from, the, 1960s, em, games, typically, combined, mechanical, engineering, technology, with, various, electrical, components, such, as, motors, switches, resistors, solenoids, relays, bells, buzzers, and, electric, lights, em, games, lie, somewhere, in, the, middle, between, fully, electronic, games, and, mechanical, games, em, games, have, a, number, of, different, genres, categories, novelty, or, land, sea, air, games, refer, to, simulation, games, that, simulate, aspects, of, various, vehicles, such, as, cars, similar, to, racing, video, games, submarines, similar, to, vehicular, combat, video, games, or, aircraft, similar, to, combat, flight, simulator, video, games, gun, games, refer, to, games, that, involve, shooting, with, a, gun, like, peripheral, such, as, a, light, gun, or, similar, device, similar, to, light, gun, shooter, video, games, general, arcade, games, refer, to, all, other, types, of, em, arcade, games, including, various, different, types, of, sports, games, audio, visual, or, realistic, games, referred, to, novelty, games, that, used, advanced, special, effects, to, provide, a, simulation, experience, merchandiser, games, are, those, where, the, player, attempts, to, win, a, prize, by, performing, some, physical, action, with, the, arcade, machine, such, as, claw, crane, games, or, coin, pusher, games, pachinko, is, a, type, of, mechanical, game, originating, in, japan, it, is, used, as, both, a, form, of, recreational, arcade, game, and, much, more, frequently, as, a, gambling, device, filling, a, japanese, gambling, niche, comparable, to, that, of, the, slot, machine, in, western, gambling, coin, operated, photo, booths, automatically, take, and, develop, three, or, four, wallet, sized, pictures, of, subjects, within, the, small, space, and, more, recently, using, digital, photography, they, are, typically, used, for, licenses, or, passports, but, there, have, been, several, types, of, photo, booths, designed, for, amusement, arcades, at, the, amusement, music, operators, association, amoa, show, in, october, 1975, taito, introduced, an, arcade, photo, booth, machine, that, combines, closed, circuit, television, cctv, recording, with, computer, printing, technology, to, produce, self, portrait, photographs, two, other, arcade, manufacturers, introduced, their, own, computerized, arcade, photo, booth, machines, at, the, same, show, a, specific, variety, designed, for, arcades, purikura, creates, selfie, photo, stickers, purikura, are, essentially, a, cross, between, a, traditional, license, passport, photo, booth, and, an, arcade, video, game, with, a, computer, which, allows, the, manipulation, of, digital, images, introduced, by, atlus, and, sega, in, 1995, the, name, is, a, shortened, form, of, the, registered, trademark, print, club, purinto, kurabu, they, are, primarily, found, in, asian, arcades, pinball, machines, are, games, that, have, a, large, enclosed, slanted, table, with, a, number, of, scoring, features, on, its, surface, players, launch, a, steel, ball, onto, the, table, and, using, pinball, flippers, try, to, keep, the, ball, in, play, while, scoring, as, many, points, as, possible, early, pinball, games, were, mostly, driven, through, mechanical, components, while, pinball, games, from, the, 1930s, onward, include, electronic, components, such, as, lights, and, sensors, and, are, one, form, of, an, electro, mechanical, game, in, limited, jurisdictions, slot, machines, may, also, be, considered, an, arcade, game, and, installed, alongside, other, games, in, arcades, however, as, slot, machines, are, mostly, games, of, chance, their, use, in, this, manner, is, highly, limited, they, are, most, often, used, for, gambling, sport, games, are, indoor, or, miniaturized, versions, of, popular, physical, sports, that, can, be, played, within, an, arcade, setting, often, with, a, reduced, ruleset, examples, include, air, hockey, and, indoor, basketball, games, like, super, shot, sports, games, can, be, either, mechanical, electro, mechanical, or, electronic, a, general, category, of, arcade, games, are, those, played, for, tickets, that, can, be, redeemed, for, prizes, the, gameplay, itself, can, be, of, any, arcade, game, and, the, number, of, tickets, received, are, proportional, to, the, player, s, score, skee, ball, is, often, played, as, a, redemption, game, while, pachinko, is, one, of, the, most, popular, redemption, games, in, japan, another, type, of, redemption, game, are, medal, game, popular, in, japan, and, southeast, asia, where, players, must, convert, their, money, into, special, medal, coins, to, play, the, game, but, can, win, more, coins, which, they, can, redeem, back, into, prizes, medal, games, are, design, to, simulate, a, gambling, like, experience, without, running, afoul, of, japan, s, strict, laws, against, gambling, arcade, games, have, generally, struggled, to, avoid, being, labelled, wholly, as, games, of, chance, or, luck, which, would, qualify, them, as, gambling, and, require, them, to, be, strictly, regulated, in, most, government, jurisdictions, games, of, chance, generally, involve, games, where, a, player, pays, money, to, participate, for, the, opportunity, to, win, a, prize, where, the, likelihood, to, win, that, prize, is, primarily, driven, by, chance, rather, than, skill, akin, to, sweepstakes, and, lotteries, slot, machines, are, typically, cataloged, as, games, of, chance, and, thus, not, typically, included, in, arcades, outside, of, certain, jurisdictions, pinball, machines, initially, were, branded, as, games, of, chance, in, the, 1940s, as, after, launching, the, ball, the, player, had, no, means, to, control, its, outcome, coupled, with, fears, of, pinball, being, a, tool, of, the, devil, over, the, youth, of, that, time, period, several, jurisdictions, took, steps, to, label, pinball, as, games, of, chance, and, banned, them, from, arcades, after, the, invention, of, the, electric, flipper, in, 1947, which, gave, the, player, more, control, on, the, fate, of, the, ball, after, launching, pinball, manufacturers, pushed, to, reclassify, pinball, as, games, of, skill, new, york, city, s, ban, on, pinball, was, overturned, in, 1976, when, roger, sharpe, a, journalist, demonstrated, the, ability, to, call, a, shot, to, a, specific, lane, to, the, city, s, council, to, prove, pinball, was, a, game, of, skill, prize, redemption, games, such, as, crane, games, and, coin, drop, games, have, been, examined, as, a, mixed, continuum, between, games, of, chance, and, skill, in, a, crane, game, for, example, there, is, some, skill, in, determining, how, to, position, the, crane, claw, over, a, prize, but, the, conditions, of, the, strength, and, condition, of, the, claw, and, the, stacking, of, the, prize, are, sufficiently, unknown, parameters, to, make, whether, the, player, will, be, successful, a, matter, of, luck, the, dominant, factor, test, is, typically, used, to, designate, when, arcade, games, are, games, of, chance, and, thus, subject, to, gambling, laws, but, for, many, redemption, games, its, application, is, a, grey, area, nearly, all, arcade, video, games, tend, to, be, treated, as, games, of, skill, challenging, the, player, against, the, pre, set, programming, of, the, game, however, arcade, video, games, that, replicate, gambling, concepts, such, as, video, poker, machines, had, emerged, in, the, 1980s, these, are, generally, treated, as, games, of, chance, and, remained, confined, to, jurisdictions, with, favorable, gambling, laws, game, of, skill, amusements, had, been, a, staple, of, fairs, since, the, 19th, century, further, the, invention, of, coin, operated, vending, machines, had, come, about, in, the, 19th, century, to, build, on, this, coin, operated, automated, amusement, machines, were, created, such, as, fortune, telling, and, strength, tester, machines, as, well, as, mutoscopes, and, installed, along, with, other, attractions, at, fairs, traveling, carnivals, and, resorts, soon, entrepreneurs, began, housing, these, coin, operated, devices, in, the, same, facilities, which, required, minimal, oversight, creating, penny, arcades, near, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, name, taken, from, the, common, use, of, a, single, penny, to, operate, the, machine, penny, arcades, started, to, gain, a, negative, reputation, as, the, most, popular, attraction, in, them, tended, to, be, mutoscopes, featuring, risqu, and, softcore, pornography, while, drawing, audiences, of, young, men, further, the, birth, of, the, film, industry, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, drew, audiences, away, from, the, penny, arcade, new, interactive, coin, operated, machines, were, created, to, bring, back, patrons, to, the, penny, arcades, creating, the, first, arcade, games, many, were, based, on, carnival, games, of, a, larger, scope, but, reduced, to, something, which, could, be, automated, one, popular, style, were, pin, based, games, which, were, based, on, the, 19th, century, game, of, bagatelle, one, of, the, first, such, pin, based, games, was, baffle, ball, a, precursor, to, the, pinball, machine, where, players, were, given, a, limited, number, of, balled, to, knock, down, targets, with, only, a, plunger, skee, ball, became, popular, after, being, featured, at, an, atlantic, city, boardwalk, arcade, the, popularity, of, these, games, was, aided, by, the, impact, of, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, as, they, provided, inexpensive, entertainment, abstract, mechanical, sports, games, date, back, to, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, in, england, which, was, the, main, manufacturer, of, arcade, games, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, london, based, automatic, sports, company, manufactured, abstract, sports, games, based, on, british, sports, including, yacht, racer, 1900, based, on, yacht, racing, and, the, cricket, match, 1903, which, simulated, a, portion, of, a, cricket, game, by, having, the, player, hit, a, pitch, into, one, of, various, holes, full, team, football, 1925, by, london, based, full, team, football, company, was, an, early, mechanical, tabletop, football, game, simulating, association, football, with, eleven, static, players, on, each, side, of, the, pitch, that, can, kick, a, ball, using, levers, driving, games, originated, from, british, arcades, in, the, 1930s, shooting, gallery, carnival, games, date, back, to, the, late, 19th, century, mechanical, gun, games, had, existed, in, england, since, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, earliest, rudimentary, examples, of, mechanical, interactive, film, games, date, back, to, the, early, 20th, century, with, cinematic, shooting, gallery, games, they, were, similar, to, shooting, gallery, carnival, games, except, that, players, shot, at, a, cinema, screen, displaying, film, footage, of, targets, they, showed, footage, of, targets, and, when, a, player, shot, the, screen, at, the, right, time, it, would, trigger, a, mechanism, that, temporarily, pauses, the, film, and, registers, a, point, the, first, successful, example, of, such, a, game, was, life, targets, released, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1912, cinematic, shooting, gallery, games, enjoyed, short, lived, popularity, in, several, parts, of, britain, during, the, 1910s, and, often, had, safari, animals, as, targets, with, footage, recorded, from, british, imperial, colonies, cinematic, shooting, gallery, games, declined, some, time, after, the, 1910s, the, first, light, guns, appeared, in, the, 1930s, with, seeburg, ray, o, lite, 1936, games, using, this, toy, rifle, were, mechanical, and, the, rifle, fired, beams, of, light, at, targets, wired, with, sensors, a, later, gun, game, from, seeburg, corporation, shoot, the, bear, 1949, introduced, the, use, of, mechanical, sound, effects, mechanical, maze, games, appeared, in, penny, arcades, by, the, mid, 20th, century, they, only, allowed, the, player, to, manipulate, the, entire, maze, unlike, later, maze, video, games, which, allowed, the, player, to, manipulate, individual, elements, within, a, maze, coin, operated, pinball, machines, that, included, electric, lights, and, features, were, developed, in, 1933, but, lacked, the, user, controlled, flipper, mechanisms, at, that, point, these, would, be, invented, in, 1947, though, the, creators, of, these, games, argued, that, these, games, were, still, skill, based, many, governments, still, considered, them, to, be, games, of, luck, and, ruled, them, as, gambling, devices, as, such, they, were, initially, banned, in, many, cities, pinball, machines, were, also, divisive, between, the, young, and, the, old, and, were, arguably, emblematic, of, the, generation, gap, found, in, america, at, the, time, some, elders, feared, what, the, youth, were, doing, and, considered, pinball, machines, to, be, tools, of, the, devil, this, led, to, even, more, bans, these, bans, were, slowly, lifted, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, new, york, city, s, ban, placed, in, 1942, lasted, until, 1976, while, chicago, s, was, lifted, in, 1977, where, pinball, was, allowed, pinball, manufacturers, carefully, distanced, their, games, from, gambling, adding, for, amusement, only, among, the, game, s, labeling, eliminating, any, redemption, features, and, asserting, these, were, games, of, skill, at, every, opportunity, by, the, early, 1970s, pinball, machines, thus, occupied, select, arcades, at, amusement, parks, at, bars, and, lounges, and, with, solitary, machines, at, various, stores, pinball, machines, beyond, the, 1970s, have, since, advanced, with, similar, improvement, in, technology, as, with, arcade, video, games, past, machines, used, discrete, electro, mechanical, and, electronic, componentry, for, game, logic, but, newer, machines, have, switched, to, solid, state, electronics, with, microprocessors, to, handle, these, elements, making, games, more, versatile, newer, machines, may, have, complex, mechanical, actions, and, detailed, backplate, graphics, that, are, supported, by, these, technologies, alternatives, to, pinball, were, electro, mechanical, games, em, games, that, clearly, demonstrated, themselves, as, games, of, skill, to, avoid, the, stigma, of, pinball, the, transition, from, mechanical, arcade, games, to, em, games, dates, back, to, around, the, time, of, world, war, ii, with, different, types, of, arcade, games, gradually, making, the, transition, during, the, post, war, period, between, the, 1940s, and, 1960s, some, early, electro, mechanical, games, were, designed, not, for, commercial, purposes, but, to, demonstrate, the, state, of, technology, at, public, expositions, such, as, nimatron, in, 1940, or, bertie, the, brain, in, 1950, in, 1941, international, mutoscope, reel, company, released, the, electro, mechanical, driving, game, drive, mobile, which, had, an, upright, arcade, cabinet, similar, to, what, arcade, video, games, would, later, use, it, was, derived, from, older, british, driving, games, from, the, 1930s, in, drive, mobile, a, steering, wheel, was, used, to, control, a, model, car, over, a, road, painted, on, a, metal, drum, with, the, goal, being, to, keep, the, car, centered, as, the, road, shifts, left, and, right, kasco, short, for, kansai, seisakusho, co, introduced, this, type, of, electro, mechanical, driving, game, to, japan, in, 1958, with, mini, drive, which, followed, a, similar, format, but, had, a, longer, cabinet, allowing, a, longer, road, by, 1961, however, the, us, arcade, industry, had, been, stagnating, this, in, turn, had, a, negative, effect, on, japanese, arcade, distributors, such, as, sega, that, had, been, depending, on, us, imports, up, until, then, sega, co, founder, david, rosen, responded, to, market, conditions, by, having, sega, develop, original, arcade, games, in, japan, from, the, late, 1960s, em, games, incorporated, more, elaborate, electronics, and, mechanical, action, to, create, a, simulated, environment, for, the, player, these, games, overlapped, with, the, introduction, of, arcade, video, games, and, in, some, cases, were, prototypical, of, the, experiences, that, arcade, video, games, offered, the, late, 1960s, to, early, 1970s, were, considered, the, electro, mechanical, golden, age, in, japan, and, the, novelty, renaissance, or, technological, renaissance, in, north, america, a, new, category, of, audio, visual, novelty, games, emerged, during, this, era, mainly, established, by, several, japanese, arcade, manufacturers, arcades, had, previously, been, dominated, by, jukeboxes, before, a, new, wave, of, em, arcade, games, emerged, that, were, able, to, generate, significant, earnings, for, arcade, operators, periscope, a, submarine, simulator, and, light, gun, shooter, was, released, by, nakamura, manufacturing, company, later, called, namco, in, 1965, and, then, by, sega, in, 1966, it, used, lights, and, plastic, waves, to, simulate, sinking, ships, from, a, submarine, and, had, players, look, through, a, periscope, to, direct, and, fire, torpedoes, which, were, represented, by, colored, lights, and, electronic, sound, effects, sega, s, version, became, a, major, success, worldwide, it, was, the, first, arcade, game, to, cost, a, quarter, per, play, and, was, a, turning, point, for, the, arcade, industry, periscope, revived, the, novelty, game, business, and, established, a, realistic, or, audio, visual, category, of, games, using, advanced, special, effects, to, provide, a, simulation, experience, it, was, the, catalyst, for, the, novelty, renaissance, where, a, wide, variety, of, novelty, specialty, games, also, called, land, sea, air, games, were, released, during, the, late, 1960s, to, early, 1970s, from, quiz, games, and, racing, games, to, hockey, and, football, games, many, adopting, the, quarter, play, price, point, these, audio, visual, games, were, selling, in, large, quantities, that, had, not, been, approached, by, most, arcade, machines, in, years, this, led, to, a, technological, renaissance, in, the, late, 1960s, which, would, later, be, critical, in, establishing, a, healthy, arcade, environment, for, video, games, to, flourish, in, the, 1970s, periscope, also, established, a, trend, of, missile, launching, gameplay, during, the, late, 1960s, to, 1970s, in, the, late, 1960s, sega, began, producing, gun, games, which, resemble, shooter, video, games, but, which, were, em, games, that, used, rear, image, projection, to, produce, moving, animations, on, a, screen, it, was, a, fresh, approach, to, gun, games, that, sega, introduced, with, duck, hunt, which, began, location, testing, in, 1968, and, released, in, january, 1969, missile, a, shooter, and, vehicular, combat, game, released, by, sega, in, 1969, may, have, been, the, first, arcade, game, to, use, a, joystick, with, a, fire, button, leading, to, joysticks, subsequently, becoming, the, standard, control, scheme, for, arcade, games, a, new, type, of, driving, game, was, introduced, in, japan, with, kasco, s, 1968, racing, game, indy, 500, which, was, licensed, by, chicago, coin, for, release, in, north, america, as, speedway, in, 1969, it, had, a, circular, racetrack, with, rival, cars, painted, on, individual, rotating, discs, illuminated, by, a, lamp, which, produced, colorful, graphics, projected, using, mirrors, to, give, a, pseudo, 3d, first, person, perspective, on, a, screen, resembling, a, windscreen, view, it, had, collision, detection, with, players, having, to, dodge, cars, to, avoid, crashing, as, well, as, electronic, sound, for, the, car, engines, and, collisions, this, gave, it, greater, realism, than, earlier, driving, games, and, it, resembled, a, prototypical, arcade, racing, video, game, with, an, upright, cabinet, yellow, marquee, three, digit, scoring, coin, box, steering, wheel, and, accelerator, pedal, indy, 500, sold, over, 2, 000, arcade, cabinets, in, japan, while, speedway, sold, over, 10, 000, cabinets, in, north, america, becoming, the, biggest, arcade, hit, in, years, like, periscope, speedway, also, charged, a, quarter, per, play, further, cementing, quarter, play, as, the, us, arcade, standard, for, over, two, decades, atari, founder, nolan, bushnell, when, he, was, a, college, student, worked, at, an, arcade, where, he, became, familiar, with, em, games, such, as, speedway, watching, customers, play, and, helping, to, maintain, the, machinery, while, learning, how, it, worked, and, developing, his, understanding, of, how, the, game, business, operates, following, the, arrival, of, arcade, video, games, with, pong, 1972, and, its, clones, em, games, continued, to, have, a, strong, presence, in, arcades, for, much, of, the, 1970s, in, japan, em, games, remained, more, popular, than, video, games, up, until, the, late, 1970s, in, the, united, states, after, the, market, became, flooded, with, pong, clones, the, pong, market, crashed, around, the, mid, 1970s, which, led, to, traditional, chicago, coin, op, manufacturers, mainly, sticking, to, em, games, up, until, the, late, 1970s, em, games, eventually, declined, following, the, arrival, of, space, invaders, 1978, and, the, golden, age, of, arcade, video, games, in, the, late, 1970s, several, em, games, that, appeared, in, the, 1970s, have, remained, popular, in, arcades, through, to, the, present, day, notably, air, hockey, whac, a, mole, and, medal, games, medal, games, started, becoming, popular, with, sega, s, harness, racing, 1974, nintendo, s, evr, race, 1975, and, aruze, s, the, derby, v, 1975, the, first, whac, a, mole, game, mogura, taiji, mole, buster, was, released, by, togo, in, 1975, in, the, late, 1970s, arcade, centers, in, japan, began, to, be, flooded, with, mole, buster, games, mogura, taiji, was, introduced, to, north, america, in, 1976, which, inspired, bob, s, space, racers, to, produce, their, own, version, of, the, game, called, whac, a, mole, in, 1977, sega, released, an, em, game, similar, to, air, hockey, in, 1968, motopolo, where, two, players, moved, around, motorbikes, to, knock, balls, into, the, opponent, s, goal, it, also, used, an, 8, track, player, to, play, back, the, sounds, of, the, motorbikes, air, hockey, itself, was, later, created, by, a, group, of, brunswick, billiards, employees, between, 1969, and, 1972, em, games, experienced, a, resurgence, during, the, 1980s, air, hockey, whac, a, mole, and, medal, games, have, since, remained, popular, arcade, attractions, after, two, attempts, to, package, mainframe, computers, running, video, games, into, a, coin, operated, arcade, cabinet, in, 1971, galaxy, game, and, computer, space, atari, released, pong, in, 1972, the, first, successful, arcade, video, game, the, number, of, arcade, game, makers, greatly, increased, over, the, next, several, years, including, several, of, the, companies, that, had, been, making, em, games, such, as, midway, bally, williams, sega, and, taito, as, technology, moved, from, transistor, transistor, logic, ttl, integrated, circuits, to, microprocessors, a, new, wave, of, arcade, video, games, arose, starting, with, taito, s, space, invaders, in, 1978, and, leading, to, a, golden, age, of, arcade, video, games, that, included, pac, man, namco, 1980, missile, command, atari, 1980, and, donkey, kong, nintendo, 1981, the, golden, age, waned, in, 1983, due, to, an, excess, number, of, arcade, games, the, growing, draw, of, home, video, game, consoles, and, computers, and, a, moral, panic, on, the, impact, of, arcade, video, games, on, youth, the, arcade, industry, was, also, partially, impacted, by,
