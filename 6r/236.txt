similar, behaviours, in, other, animals, such, as, bonobos, which, are, known, to, kiss, after, fighting, possibly, to, restore, peace, others, believe, that, it, is, a, learned, behaviour, having, evolved, from, activities, such, as, suckling, or, premastication, in, early, human, cultures, passed, on, to, modern, humans, another, theory, posits, that, the, practice, originated, in, males, during, the, paleolithic, era, tasting, the, saliva, of, females, to, test, their, health, in, order, to, determine, whether, they, would, make, a, good, partner, for, procreation, the, fact, that, not, all, human, cultures, kiss, is, used, as, an, argument, against, kissing, being, an, instinctual, behaviour, in, humans, only, around, 90, of, the, human, population, is, believed, to, practice, kissing, the, earliest, reference, to, kissing, like, behavior, comes, from, the, vedas, sanskrit, scriptures, that, informed, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, around, 3, 500, years, ago, according, to, vaughn, bryant, an, anthropologist, at, texas, a, m, university, who, specialized, in, the, history, of, the, kiss, however, recent, studies, challenge, the, belief, that, kissing, originated, in, south, asia, around, 1500, bce, arguing, that, there, is, no, single, point, of, origin, in, historical, times, figurines, have, been, found, that, indicate, kissing, may, have, been, practiced, in, prehistory, it, s, been, suggested, that, neandertals, and, humans, kissed, evidence, from, ancient, mesopotamia, and, egypt, suggests, that, kissing, was, documented, as, early, as, 2500, bce, kissing, was, present, in, both, romantic, and, familial, contexts, in, ancient, mesopotamia, but, it, was, subject, to, social, regulation, and, public, display, of, the, sexual, aspect, of, kissing, was, discouraged, kissing, also, had, a, role, in, rituals, the, act, of, kissing, may, have, unintentionally, facilitated, the, transmission, of, orally, transmitted, microorganisms, potentially,

of, the, herpes, simplex, virus, 1, hsv, 1, during, the, bronze, age, implies, that, cultural, practices, like, romantic, sexual, kissing, could, have, contributed, to, its, transmission, ancient, mesopotamian, medical, texts, mention, a, disease, called, bu, shanu, which, may, have, been, related, to, hsv, 1, infection, while, kissing, itself, was, not, directly, associated, with, disease, transmission, in, mesopotamia, certain, cultural, and, religious, factors, governed, its, practice, both, lip, and, tongue, kissing, are, mentioned, in, sumerian, poetry, my, lips, are, too, small, they, know, not, to, kiss, my, precious, sweet, lying, by, my, heart, one, by, one, tonguemaking, one, by, one, when, my, sweet, precious, my, heart, had, lain, down, too, each, of, them, in, turn,

the, tomb, i, lie, i, will, arise, and, break, the, bands, of, death, the, earliest, reference, to, kissing, in, the, old, testament, is, in, genesis, 27, 26, when, jacob, deceives, his, father, to, obtain, his, blessing, and, his, father, isaac, said, unto, him, come, near, now, and, kiss, me, my, son, genesis, 29, 11, features, the, first, man, woman, kiss, in, the, bible, when, jacob, flees, from, esau, and, goes, to, the, house, of, his, uncle, laban, and, jacob, kissed, rachel, and, lifted, up, his, voice, and, wept, much, later, there, is, the, oft, quoted, verse, from, song, of, songs, 1, 2, may, he, kiss, me, with, the, kisses, of, his, mouth, for, your, love, is, better, than, wine, in, cyropaedia, 370, bc, xenophon, wrote, about, the, persian, custom, of, kissing, in, the, lips, upon, departure, while, narrating, the, departure, of, cyrus, the, great, c, 600, bc, as, a, boy, from, his, median, kinsmen, according, to, herodotus, 5th, century, bc, when, two, persians, meet, the, greeting, formula, expresses, their, equal, or, inequal, status, they, do, not, speak, rather, equals, kiss, each, other, on, the, mouth, and, in, the, case, where, one, is, a, little, inferior, to, the, other, the, kiss, is, given, on, the, cheek, during, the, later, classical, period, affectionate, mouth, to, mouth, kissing, was, first, described, in, the, hindu, epic, the, mahabharata, anthropologist, vaughn, bryant, argues, kissing, spread, from, india, to, europe, after, alexander, the, great, conquered, parts, of, punjab, in, northern, india, in, 326, bce, the, romans, were, passionate, about, kissing, and, talked, about, several, types, of, kissing, kissing, the, hand, or, cheek, was, called, an, osculum, kissing, on, the, lips, with, mouth, closed, was, called, a, basium, which, was, used, between, relatives, a, kiss, of, passion, was, called, a, suavium, kissing, was, not, always, an, indication, of, eros, or, love, but, also, could, show, respect, and, rank, as, it, was, used, in, medieval, europe, the, study, of, kissing, started, sometime, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, is, called, philematology, which, has, been, studied, by, people, including, cesare, lombroso, ernest, crawley, charles, darwin, edward, burnett, tylor, and, modern, scholars, such, as, elaine, hatfield, kristoffer, nyrop, identified, a, number, of, types, of, kisses, including, kisses, of, love, affection, peace, respect, and, friendship, he, notes, however, that, the, categories, are, somewhat, contrived, and, overlapping, and, some, cultures, have, more, kinds, including, the, french, with, twenty, and, the, germans, with, thirty, kissing, another, person, s, lips, has, become, a, common, expression, of, affection, or, warm, greeting, in, many, cultures, worldwide, yet, in, certain, cultures, kissing, was, introduced, only, through, european, settlement, before, which, it, was, not, a, routine, occurrence, such, cultures, include, certain, indigenous, peoples, of, australia, the, tahitians, and, many, tribes, in, africa, a, kiss, can, also, be, used, to, express, feelings, without, an, erotic, element, but, can, be, nonetheless, far, deeper, and, more, lasting, writes, nyrop, he, adds, that, such, kisses, can, be, expression, of, love, in, the, widest, and, most, comprehensive, meaning, of, the, word, bringing, a, message, of, loyal, affection, gratitude, compassion, sympathy, intense, joy, and, profound, sorrow, 79, nyrop, writes, that, the, most, common, example, is, the, intense, feeling, which, knits, parents, to, their, offspring, but, he, adds, that, kisses, of, affection, are, not, only, common, between, parents, and, children, but, also, between, other, members, of, the, same, family, which, can, include, those, outside, the, immediate, family, circle, everywhere, where, deep, affection, unites, people, 82, the, tradition, is, written, of, in, the, bible, as, when, esau, met, jacob, after, a, long, separation, he, ran, towards, him, fell, on, his, neck, and, kissed, him, genesis, 33, 4, moses, greeted, his, father, in, law, and, kissed, him, exodus, 18, 7, and, orpah, kissed, her, mother, in, law, before, leaving, her, ruth, 1, 14, the, family, kiss, was, traditional, with, the, romans, and, kisses, of, affection, are, often, mentioned, by, the, early, greeks, as, when, odysseus, on, reaching, his, home, meets, his, faithful, shepherds, 82, 83, affection, can, be, a, cause, of, kissing, in, all, ages, in, grave, and, solemn, moments, notes, nyrop, not, only, among, those, who, love, each, other, but, also, as, an, expression, of, profound, gratitude, when, the, apostle, paul, took, leave, of, the, elders, of, the, congregation, at, ephesus, they, all, wept, sore, and, fell, on, paul, s, neck, and, kissed, him, acts, 20, 37, kisses, can, also, be, exchanged, between, total, strangers, as, when, there, is, a, profound, sympathy, with, or, the, warmest, interest, in, another, person, 85, folk, poetry, has, been, the, source, of, affectionate, kisses, where, they, sometimes, played, an, important, part, as, when, they, had, the, power, to, cast, off, spells, or, to, break, bonds, of, witchcraft, and, sorcery, often, restoring, a, man, to, his, original, shape, nyrop, notes, the, poetical, stories, of, the, redeeming, power, of, the, kiss, are, to, be, found, in, the, literature, of, many, countries, especially, for, example, in, the, old, french, arthurian, romances, lancelot, guiglain, in, which, the, princess, is, changed, by, evil, arts, into, a, dreadful, dragon, and, can, only, resume, her, human, shape, in, the, case, of, a, knight, being, brave, enough, to, kiss, her, in, the, reverse, situation, in, the, tale, of, beauty, and, the, beast, a, transformed, prince, then, told, the, girl, that, he, had, been, bewitched, by, a, wicked, fairy, and, could, not, be, recreated, into, a, man, unless, a, maid, fell, in, love, with, him, and, kissed, him, despite, his, ugliness, 95, 96, a, kiss, of, affection, can, also, take, place, after, death, in, genesis, 50, 1, it, is, written, that, when, jacob, was, dead, joseph, fell, upon, his, father, s, face, and, wept, upon, him, and, kissed, him, and, it, is, told, of, abu, bakr, muhammad, s, first, disciple, father, in, law, and, successor, that, when, the, prophet, was, dead, he, went, into, the, latter, s, tent, uncovered, his, face, and, kissed, his, forehead, nyrop, writes, that, the, kiss, is, the, last, tender, proof, of, love, bestowed, on, one, we, have, loved, and, was, believed, in, ancient, times, to, follow, mankind, to, the, nether, world, 97, kissing, on, the, lips, can, be, a, physical, expression, of, affection, or, love, between, two, people, in, which, the, sensations, of, touch, taste, and, smell, are, involved, according, to, the, psychologist, menachem, brayer, although, many, mammals, birds, and, insects, exchange, caresses, which, appear, to, be, kisses, of, affection, they, are, not, kisses, in, the, human, sense, surveys, indicate, that, kissing, is, the, second, most, common, form, of, physical, intimacy, among, united, states, adolescents, after, holding, hands, and, that, about, 85, of, 15, to, 16, year, old, adolescents, in, the, us, have, experienced, it, the, kiss, on, the, lips, can, be, performed, between, two, friends, or, family, this, move, aims, to, express, affection, for, a, friend, unlike, kissing, for, love, a, friendly, kiss, has, no, sexual, connotation, the, kiss, on, the, lips, is, a, practice, that, can, be, found, in, the, time, of, patriarchs, bible, in, ancient, greece, the, kiss, on, the, mouth, was, used, to, express, a, concept, of, equality, between, people, of, the, same, rank, in, the, middle, ages, the, kiss, of, peace, was, recommended, by, the, catholic, church, the, kiss, on, the, lips, was, also, common, among, knights, the, gesture, has, again, become, popular, with, young, people, particularly, in, england, in, many, cultures, it, is, considered, a, harmless, custom, for, teenagers, to, kiss, on, a, date, or, to, engage, in, kissing, games, with, friends, these, games, serve, as, icebreakers, at, parties, and, may, be, some, participants, first, exposure, to, sexuality, there, are, many, such, games, including, truth, or, dare, seven, minutes, in, heaven, or, the, variation, two, minutes, in, the, closet, spin, the, bottle, post, office, and, wink, the, psychologist, william, cane, notes, that, kissing, in, western, society, is, often, a, romantic, act, and, describes, a, few, of, its, attributes, it, s, not, hard, to, tell, when, two, people, are, in, love, maybe, they, re, trying, to, hide, it, from, the, world, still, they, cannot, conceal, their, inner, excitement, men, will, give, themselves, away, by, a, certain, excited, trembling, in, the, muscles, of, the, lower, jaw, upon, seeing, their, beloved, women, will, often, turn, pale, immediately, of, seeing, their, lover, and, then, get, slightly, red, in, the, face, as, their, sweetheart, draws, near, this, is, the, effect, of, physical, closeness, upon, two, people, who, are, in, love, 9, romantic, kissing, in, western, cultures, is, a, fairly, recent, development, and, is, rarely, mentioned, even, in, ancient, greek, literature, in, the, middle, ages, it, became, a, social, gesture, and, was, considered, a, sign, of, refinement, of, the, upper, classes, 150, 151, other, cultures, have, different, definitions, and, uses, of, kissing, notes, brayer, in, china, for,

asian, countries, the, sniff, kiss, is, the, most, common, form, of, affection, and, western, mouth, to, mouth, kissing, is, often, reserved, for, sexual, foreplay, in, some, tribal, cultures, the, equivalent, to, kiss, me, is, smell, me, the, kiss, can, be, an, important, expression, of, love, and, erotic, emotions, in, his, book, the, kiss, and, its, history, kristoffer, nyrop, describes, the, kiss, of, love, as, an, exultant, message, of, the, longing, of, love, love, eternally, young, the, burning, prayer, of, hot, desire, which, is, born, on, the, lovers, lips, and, rises, as, charles, fuster, has, said, up, to, the, blue, sky, from, the, green, plains, like, a, tender, trembling, thank, offering, nyrop, adds, that, the, love, kiss, rich, in, promise, bestows, an, intoxicating, feeling, of, infinite, happiness, courage, and, youth, and, therefore, surpasses, all, other, earthly, joys, in, sublimity, 30, he, also, compares, it, to, achievements, in, life, thus, even, the, highest, work, of, art, yet, the, loftiest, reputation, is, nothing, in, comparison, with, the, passionate, kiss, of, a, woman, one, loves, 31, the, power, of, a, kiss, is, not, minimized, when, he, writes, that, we, all, yearn, for, kisses, and, we, all, seek, them, it, is, idle, to, struggle, against, this, passion, no, one, can, evade, the, omnipotence, of, the, kiss, kissing, he, implies, can, lead, one, to, maturity, it, is, through, kisses, that, a, knowledge, of, life, and, happiness, first, comes, to, us, runeberg, says, that, the, angels, rejoice, over, the, first, kiss, exchanged, by, lovers, and, can, keep, one, feeling, young, it, carries, life, with, it, it, even, bestows, the, gift, of, eternal, youth, the, importance, of, the, lover, s, kiss, can, also, be, significant, he, notes, in, the, case, of, lovers, a, kiss, is, everything, that, is, the, reason, why, a, man, stakes, his, all, for, a, kiss, and, man, craves, for, it, as, his, noblest, reward, 37, as, a, result, kissing, as, an, expression, of, love, is, contained, in, much, of, literature, old, and, new, nyrop, gives, a, vivid, example, in, the, classic, love, story, of, daphnis, and, chloe, as, a, reward, chloe, has, bestowed, a, kiss, on, daphnis, an, innocent, young, maid, s, kiss, but, it, has, on, him, the, effect, of, an, electrical, shock, 47, ye, gods, what, are, my, feelings, her, lips, are, softer, than, the, rose, s, leaf, her, mouth, is, sweet, as, honey, and, her, kiss, inflicts, on, me, more, pain, than, a, bee, s, sting, i, have, often, kissed, my, kids, i, have, often, kissed, my, lambs, but, never, have, i, known, aught, like, this, my, pulse, is, beating, fast, my, heart, throbs, it, is, as, if, i, were, about, to, suffocate, yet, nevertheless, i, want, to, have, another, kiss, strange, never, suspected, pain, has, chloe, i, wonder, drunk, some, poisonous, draught, ere, she, kissed, me, how, comes, it, that, she, herself, has, not, died, of, it, romantic, kissing, requires, more, than, simple, proximity, notes, cane, it, also, needs, some, degree, of, intimacy, or, privacy, which, is, why, you, ll, see, lovers, stepping, to, the, side, of, a, busy, street, or, sidewalk, psychologist, wilhelm, reich, lashed, out, at, society, for, not, giving, young, lovers, enough, privacy, and, making, it, difficult, to, be, alone, however, cane, describes, how, many, lovers, manage, to, attain, romantic, privacy, despite, being, in, a, public, setting, as, they, lock, their, minds, together, and, thereby, create, an, invisible, sense, of, psychological, privacy, he, adds, in, this, way, they, can, kiss, in, public, even, in, a, crowded, plaza, and, keep, it, romantic, 10, nonetheless, when, cane, asked, people, to, describe, the, most, romantic, places, they, ever, kissed, their, answers, almost, always, referred, to, this, ends, of, the, earth, isolation, they, mentioned, an, apple, orchard, a, beach, out, in, a, field, looking, at, the, stars, or, at, a, pond, in, a, secluded, area, 10, a, french, kiss, also, known, as, cataglottism, or, a, tongue, kiss, is, an, amorous, kiss, in, which, the, participants, tongues, extend,

the, sensation, when, two, tongues, touch, also, known, as, tongue, touching, has, been, proven, to, stimulate, endorphin, release, and, reduce, acute, stress, levels, extended, french, kissing, may, be, part, of, making, out, the, term, originated, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, in, america, and, great, britain, as, the, french, had, acquired, a, reputation, for, more, adventurous, and, passionate, sex, practices, french, kissing, may, be, a, mode, for, disease, transmission, particularly, if, there, are, open, wounds, throughout, history, a, kiss, has, been, a, ritual, formal, symbolic, or, social, gesture, indicating, devotion, respect, or, greeting, it, appears, as, a, ritual, or, symbol, of, religious, devotion, for, example, in, the, case, of, kissing, a, temple, floor, or, a, religious, book, or, icon, besides, devotion, a, kiss, has, also, indicated, subordination, or, nowadays, respect, in, modern, times, the, practice, continues, as, in, the, case, of, a, bride, and, groom, kissing, at, the, conclusion, of, a, wedding, ceremony, or, national, leaders, kissing, each, other, in, greeting, and, in, many, other, situations, a, kiss, in, a, religious, context, is, common, in, earlier, periods, of, christianity, or, islam, kissing, became, a, ritual, gesture, and, is, still, treated, as, such, in, certain, customs, as, when, kissing, relics, or, a, bishop, s, ring, in, judaism, the, kissing, of, the, torah, scroll, a, prayer, book, and, a, prayer, shawl, is, also, common, crawley, notes, that, it, was, very, significant, of, the, affectionate, element, in, religion, to, give, so, important, a, part, to, the, kiss, as, part, of, its, ritual, in, the, early, church, the, baptized, were, kissed, by, the, celebrant, after, the, ceremony, and, its, use, was, even, extended, as, a, salute, to, saints, and, religious, heroes, with, crawley, adding, thus, joseph, kissed, jacob, and, his, disciples, kissed, paul, joseph, kissed, his, dead, father, and, the, custom, was, retained, in, our, civilization, as, the, farewell, kiss, on, dead, relatives, although, certain, sects, prohibit, this, today, 126, a, distinctive, element, in, the, christian, liturgy, was, noted, by, justin, in, the, 2nd, century, now, referred, to, as, the, kiss, of, peace, and, once, part, of, the, rite, in, the, primitive, mass, conybeare, has, stated, that, this, act, originated, within, the, ancient, hebrew, synagogue, and, philo, the, ancient, jewish, philosopher, called, it, a, kiss, of, harmony, where, as, crawley, explains, the, word, of, god, brings, hostile, things, together, in, concord, and, the, kiss, of, love, 128, saint, cyril, also, writes, this, kiss, is, the, sign, that, our, souls, are, united, and, that, we, banish, all, remembrance, of, injury, 128, nyrop, notes, that, the, kiss, of, peace, was, used, as, an, expression, of, deep, spiritual, devotion, in, the, early, christian, church, christ, said, for, instance, peace, be, with, you, my, peace, i, give, you, and, the, members, of, christ, s, church, gave, each, other, peace, symbolically, through, a, kiss, st, paul, repeatedly, speaks, of, the, holy, kiss, and, in, his, epistle, to, the, romans, writes, salute, one, another, with, an, holy, kiss, and, his, first, epistle, to, the, thessalonians, 1, thessalonians, 5, 26, he, says, greet, all, the, brethren, with, an, holy, kiss, 101, the, kiss, of, peace, was, also, used, in, secular, festivities, during, the, middle, ages, for, example, nyrop, points, out, that, it, was, the, custom, to, seal, the, reconciliation, and, pacification, of, enemies, by, a, kiss, even, knights, gave, each, other, the, kiss, of, peace, before, proceeding, to, the, combat, and, forgave, one, another, all, real, or, imaginary, wrongs, the, holy, kiss, was, also, found, in, the, ritual, of, the, church, on, solemn, occasions, such, as, baptism, marriage, confession, ordination, or, obsequies, however, toward, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, the, kiss, of, peace, disappears, as, the, official, token, of, reconciliation, 109, the, kiss, of, respect, is, of, ancient, origin, notes, nyrop, he, writes, that, from, the, remotest, times, we, find, it, applied, to, all, that, is, holy, noble, and, worshipful, to, the, gods, their, statues, temples, and, altars, as, well, as, to, kings, and, emperors, out, of, reverence, people, even, kissed, the, ground, and, both, sun, and, moon, were, greeted, with, kisses, 114, he, notes, some, examples, as, when, the, prophet, hosea, laments, over, the, idolatry, of, the, children, of, israel, he, says, that, they, make, molten, images, of, calves, and, kiss, them, hosea, 13, 2, in, classical, times, similar, homage, was, often, paid, to, the, gods, and, people, were, known, to, kiss, the, hands, knees, feet, and, the, mouths, of, their, idols, cicero, writes, that, the, lips, and, beard, of, the, famous, statue, of, hercules, at, agrigentum, were, worn, away, by, the, kisses, of, devotees, 115, people, kissed, the, cross, with, the, image, of, jesus, and, such, kissing, of, the, cross, is, always, considered, a, holy, act, in, many, countries, it, is, required, on, taking, an, oath, as, the, highest, assertion, that, the, witness, would, be, speaking, the, truth, nyrop, notes, that, as, a, last, act, of, charity, the, image, of, the, redeemer, is, handed, to, the, dying, or, death, condemned, to, be, kissed, kissing, the, cross, brings, blessing, and, happiness, people, kiss, the, image, of, mary, and, the, pictures, and, statues, of, saints, not, only, their, pictures, but, even, their, relics, are, kissed, notes, nyrop, they, make, both, soul, and, body, whole, there, are, legends, innumerable, of, sick, people, regaining, their, health, by, kissing, relics, he, points, out, 121, the, kiss, of, respect, has, also, represented, a, mark, of, fealty, humility, and, reverence, its, use, in, ancient, times, was, widespread, and, nyrop, gives, examples,
