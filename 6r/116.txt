purely, plant, based, products, and, that, additions, indicating, the, plant, origin, of, the, products, soy, milk, does, not, influence, that, prohibition, the, earliest, record, of, soybean, milk, is, on, a, stone, slab, of, the, eastern, han, dynasty, unearthed, in, china, on, which, is, engraved, the, situation, of, making, soy, milk, in, ancient, kitchens, a, tofu, broth, doufujiang, c, 1365, was, used, during, the, mongol, yuan, as, doujiang, this, drink, remains, a, common, watery, form, of, soy, milk, in, china, usually, prepared, from, fresh, soybeans, the, compendium, of, materia, medica, which, was, completed, in, 1578, also, has, an, evaluation, of, soymilk, its, use, increased, during, the, qing, dynasty, apparently, due, to, the, discovery, that, gently, heating, doujiang, for, at, least, 90, minutes, hydrolyzed, or, helped, to, break, down, its, undesirable, raffinose, and, stachyose, oligosaccharides, which, can, cause, flatulence, and, digestive, pain, among, lactose, intolerant, adults, by, the, 18th, century, it, was, common, enough, that, street, vendors, were, hawking, it, in, the, 19th, it, was, also, common, to, take, a, cup, to, tofu, shops, to, get, hot, fresh, doujiang, for, breakfast, it, was, already, often, paired, with, youtiao, which, was, dipped, into, it, the, process, was, industrialized, in, early, republican, china, by, 1929, two, shanghai, factories, were, selling, over, 1000, bottles, a, day, and, another, in, beijing, was, almost, as, productive, itself, following, disruption, from, the, second, world, war, and, the, chinese, civil, war, soy, milk, began, to, be, marketed, in, soft, drink, like, fashion, in, hong, kong, singapore, and, japan, in, the, 1950s, soymilk, was, mentioned, in, various, european, letters, from, china, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, soy, milk, entered, the, english, language, as, soy, bean, milk, in, an, 1897, usda, report, li, yuying, established, cas, o, soja, ne, the, first, soy, milk, dairy, in, colombes, france, in, 1910, he, received, the, first, british, and, american, patents, for, soy, milk, manufacturing, in, 1912, and, 1913, j, a, chard, began, production, of, soy, lac, in, new, york, city, united, states, in, 1917, harry, w, miller, an, american, businessman, forced, to, relocate, his, factory, from, shanghai, owing, to, world, war, ii, was, similarly, compelled, by, the, usda, and, the, us, dairy, industry, to, use, the, term, soya, lac, rather, than, soy, milk, john, harvey, kellogg, had, been, working, with, what, he, called, soymilk, at, his, battle, creek, sanitarium, since, 1930, but, was, similarly, compelled, to, market, his, acidophilus, enriched, beverage, as, soygal, when, it, began, commercial, production, in, 1942, a, string, of, 40, court, cases, against, rich, products, between, 1949, and, 1974, finally, established, that, non, dairy, milks, and, imitation, dairy, products, were, a, new, and, distinct, food, rather, than, inferior, and, illegal, knock, offs, cornell, researchers, established, the, enzyme, lipoxygenase, as, responsible, for, the, beany, flavor, of, soy, milk, made, in, 1966, the, same, research, established, a, process, for, reducing, or, eliminating, the, bean, flavor, from, commercial, products, with, tetra, pak, cartons, extending, its, shelf, life, hong, kong, based, vitasoy, reintroduced, soy, milk, to, the, us, market, in, 1980, and, brought, it, to, 20, other, countries, within, a, few, years, alpro, similarly, began, production, in, belgium, in, 1980, quickly, becoming, europe, s, leading, producer, new, production, technology, and, techniques, began, to, permit, soy, beverages, with, an, appreciably, more, milk, like, flavor, and, consistency, in, the, mid, 1980s, soy, milk, is, made, from, whole, soybeans, or, full, fat, soy, flour, the, dry, beans, are, soaked, in, water, for, a, minimum, of, three, hours, up, to, overnight, depending, on, the, temperature, of, the, water, the, rehydrated, beans, then, undergo, wet, grinding, with, enough, added, water, to, give, the, desired, solids, content, to, the, final, product, which, has, a, protein, content, of, 1, 4, depending, on, the, method, of, production, the, ratio, of, water, to, beans, on, a, weight, basis, is, 10, 1, for, traditional, soy, milk, the, resulting, slurry, or, pur, e, is, brought, to, a, boil, to, improve, its, taste, properties, see, soy, odor, below, by, heat, inactivating, soybean, trypsin, inhibitor, and, to, sterilize, the, product, heating, at, or, near, the, boiling, point, is, continued, for, a, period, of, time, 15, 20, minutes, followed, by, the, removal, of, insoluble, residues, soy, pulp, fiber, by, straining, filtration, processing, requires, the, use, of, an, anti, foaming, agent, or, natural, defoamer, during, the, boiling, step, bringing, filtered, soy, milk, to, a, boil, avoids, the, problem, of, foaming, it, is, generally, opaque, white, or, off, white, in, color, and, approximately, the, same, consistency, as, cow, s, milk, quality, attributes, during, preparation, include, germination, time, for, the, beans, used, acidity, total, protein, and, carbohydrates, phytic, acid, content, and, viscosity, raw, soy, milk, may, be, sweetened, flavored, and, fortified, with, micronutrients, once, fully, processed, soy, milk, products, are, typically, sold, in, plastic, bottles, or, plastic, coated, cartons, such, as, tetrapaks, traditional, east, asian, soymilk, has, a, beany, odor, partly, of, hexanal, considered, disagreeable, by, most, westerners, this, is, caused, by, the, lipooxygenase, lox, in, the, soy, oxidizing, the, fat, in, the, beans, rehydrating, the, beans, allows, the, reaction, to, proceed, with, the, oxygen, gas, dissolved, in, soaking, water, to, eliminate, the, odor, one, can, either, disable, the, lox, enzyme, with, heat, or, remove, the, oxygen, dissolved, in, the, water, the, former, can, be, achieved, by, soaking, beans, in, hot, water, a, hot, grind, skipping, the, soak, entirely, or, blanching, the, soy, in, water, or, steam, first, the, latter, can, be, achieved, by, a, variety, of, chemical, means, such, as, adding, glucose, and, glucose, oxidase, to, consume, the, oxygen, the, soybean, cultivar, also, influences, the, odor, and, a, mutant, cultivar, lacking, lox, completely, has, been, produced, the, issue, and, preference, of, soy, odor, also, affects, products, made, from, soymilk, especially, tofu, see, tofu, flavor, with, soybean, production, increasing, worldwide, during, the, early, 21st, century, and, consumer, interest, in, plant, milks, growing, from, demand, in, asia, europe, and, the, united, states, soy, milk, became, the, second, most, consumed, plant, milk, after, almond, milk, by, 2019, soy, milk, sales, declined, in, the, united, states, during, 2018, 19, mainly, due, to, the, rising, popularity, of, almond, milk, and, loss, of, market, share, to, the, successful, introduction, of, oat, milk, according, to, market, research, in, 2019, the, worldwide, market, for, soy, milk, was, growing, at, an, annual, rate, of, 6, and, was, forecast, to, reach, 11, billion, in, total, commerce, by, 2025, growth, in, consumption, was, due, mainly, to, expanding, the, flavors, of, sweetened, soy, milks, and, uses, in, desserts, whereas, unsweetened, soy, milk, was, being, used, particularly, in, asia, pacific, countries, as, an, ingredient, in, snacks, and, various, prepared, foods, a, cup, 243, ml, serving, of, a, generic, unsweetened,

milk, contains, appreciable, levels, of, vitamin, a, b, vitamins, and, vitamin, d, in, a, range, of, 10, to, 45, of, the, daily, value, with, calcium, and, magnesium, also, in, significant, content, it, has, a, glycemic, index, of, 34, 4, for, protein, quality, one, study, gave, soya, milk, a, digestible, indispensable, amino, acid, score, diaas, of, 78, for, infants, 99, for, young, children, and, 117, for, older, children, adolescents, and, adults, with, the, limiting, amino, acid, for, those, groups, being, leucine, lysine, and, valine, respectively, a, diaas, of, 100, or, more, is, considered, to, be, an, excellent, high, protein, quality, source, non, human, milks, are, fortified, manufactured, sweetened, soy, milk, has, an, oatmeal, like, nutty, flavor, in, acidic, hot, drinks, such, as, coffee, curdling, may, occur, requiring, some, manufacturers, to, add, acidity, regulators, soybeans, and, soy, milk, in, particular, contain, phytic, acid, which, may, act, as, a, chelating, agent, and, inhibit, mineral, absorption, especially, for, diets, already, low, in, minerals, however, dietary, intake, of, phytic, acid, may, help, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, colon, cancer, soy, milk, is, a, common, beverage, in, east, asian, cuisines, in, many, countries, soy, milk, is, used, in, vegan, and, vegetarian, food, products, and, as, a, substituve, replacement, for, cow, s, milk, in, many, recipes, soy, milk, is, also, used, in, making, imitation, dairy, products, such, as, soy, yogurt, soy, cream, soy, kefir, and, soy, based, cheese, analogues, it, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, for, making, milkshakes, pancakes, smoothies, bread, mayonnaise, and, baked, goods, using, soybeans, to, make, milk, instead, of, raising, cows, is, ecologically, advantageous, cows, require, much, more, energy, to, produce, milk, since, the, farmer, must, feed, the, animal, which, can, consume, up, to, 24, kilograms, 53, lb, of, food, in, dry, matter, basis, and, 90, to, 180, litres, 24, to, 48, us, gal, of, water, a, day, producing, an, average, of, 40, kilograms, 88, lb, of, milk, a, day, legumes, including, the, soybean, plant, also, replenish, the, nitrogen, content, of, the, soil, in, which, they, are, grown, the, cultivation, of, soybeans, in, south, america, is, a, cause, of, deforestation, specifically, in, the, amazon, rainforest, and, a, range, of, other, large, scale, environmental, harm, however, the, majority, of, soybean, cultivation, worldwide, especially, in, south, america, where, cattle, farming, is, widespread, is, intended, for, livestock, fodder, rather, than, soy, milk, production
