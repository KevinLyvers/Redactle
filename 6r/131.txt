in, common, usage, salt, is, a, mineral, composed, primarily, of, sodium, chloride, nacl, when, used, in, food, especially, in, granulated, form, it, is, more, formally, called, table, salt, in, the, form, of, a, natural, crystalline, mineral, salt, is, also, known, as, rock, salt, or, halite, salt, is, essential, for, life, in, general, and, saltiness, is, one, of, the, basic, human, tastes, salt, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, ubiquitous, food, seasonings, and, is, known, to, uniformly, improve, the, taste, perception, of, food, including, otherwise, unpalatable, food, salting, brining, and, pickling, are, also, ancient, and, important, methods, of, food, preservation, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, salt, processing, dates, to, around, 6000, bc, when, people, living, in, the, area, of, present, day, romania, boiled, spring, water, to, extract, salts, a, salt, works, in, china, dates, to, approximately, the, same, period, salt, was, also, prized, by, the, ancient, hebrews, greeks, romans, byzantines, hittites, egyptians, and, indians, salt, became, an, important, article, of, trade, and, was, transported, by, boat, across, the, mediterranean, sea, along, specially, built, salt, roads, and, across, the, sahara, on, camel, caravans, the, scarcity, and, universal, need, for, salt, have, led, nations, to, go, to, war, over, it, and, use, it, to, raise, tax, revenues, salt, is, used, in, religious, ceremonies, and, has, other, cultural, and, traditional, significance, salt, is, processed, from, salt, mines, and, by, the, evaporation, of, seawater, sea, salt, and, mineral, rich, spring, water, in, shallow, pools, the, greatest, single, use, for, salt, sodium, chloride, is, as, a, feedstock, for, the, production, of, chemicals, it, is, used, to, produce, caustic, soda, and, chlorine, it, is, also, used, in, the, manufacturing, processes, of, polyvinyl, chloride, plastics, paper, pulp, and, many, other, products, of, the, annual, global, production, of, around, three, hundred, million, tonnes, of, salt, only, a, small, percentage, is, used, for, human, consumption, other, uses, include, water, conditioning, processes, de, icing, highways, and, agricultural, use, edible, salt, is, sold, in, forms, such, as, sea, salt, and, table, salt, the, latter, of, which, usually, contains, an, anti, caking, agent, and, may, be, iodised, to, prevent, iodine, deficiency, as, well, as, its, use, in, cooking, and, at, the, table, salt, is, present, in, many, processed, foods, sodium, is, an, essential, element, for, human, health, via, its, role, as, an, electrolyte, and, osmotic, solute, however, excessive, salt, consumption, may, increase, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, such, as, hypertension, in, children, and, adults, such, health, effects, of, salt, have, long, been, studied, accordingly, numerous, world, health, associations, and, experts, in, developed, countries, recommend, reducing, consumption, of, popular, salty, foods, the, world, health, organization, recommends, that, adults, consume, less, than, 2, 000, mg, of, sodium, equivalent, to, 5, grams, of, salt, per, day, all, through, history, the, availability, of, salt, has, been, pivotal, to, civilization, what, is, now, thought, to, have, been, the, first, city, in, europe, is, solnitsata, in, bulgaria, which, was, a, salt, mine, providing, the, area, now, known, as, the, balkans, with, salt, since, 5400, bc, even, the, name, solnitsata, means, salt, works, while, people, have, used, canning, and, artificial, refrigeration, to, preserve, food, for, the, last, hundred, years, or, so, salt, has, been, the, best, known, food, preservative, especially, for, meat, for, many, thousands, of, years, a, very, ancient, salt, works, operation, has, been, discovered, at, the, poiana, slatinei, archaeological, site, next, to, a, salt, spring, in, lunca, neam, county, romania, evidence, indicates, that, neolithic, people, of, the, precucuteni, culture, were, boiling, the, salt, laden, spring, water, through, the, process, of, briquetage, to, extract, the, salt, as, far, back, as, 6050, bc, the, salt, extracted, from, this, operation, may, have, had, a, direct, correlation, to, the, rapid, growth, of, this, society, s, population, soon, after, its, initial, production, began, the, harvest, of, salt, from, the, surface, of, xiechi, lake, near, yuncheng, in, shanxi, china, dates, back, to, at, least, 6000, bc, making, it, one, of, the, oldest, verifiable, saltworks, there, is, more, salt, in, animal, tissues, such, as, meat, blood, and, milk, than, in, plant, tissues, nomads, who, subsist, on, their, flocks, and, herds, do, not, eat, salt, with, their, food, but, agriculturalists, feeding, mainly, on, cereals, and, vegetable, matter, need, to, supplement, their, diet, with, salt, with, the, spread, of, civilization, salt, became, one, of, the, world, s, main, trading, commodities, it, was, of, high, value, to, the, ancient, hebrews, the, greeks, the, romans, the, byzantines, the, hittites, and, other, peoples, of, antiquity, in, the, middle, east, salt, was, used, to, ceremonially, seal, an, agreement, and, the, ancient, hebrews, made, a, covenant, of, salt, with, god, and, sprinkled, salt, on, their, offerings, to, show, their, trust, in, him, an, ancient, practice, in, time, of, war, was, salting, the, earth, scattering, salt, around, in, a, defeated, city, to, prevent, plant, growth, the, bible, tells, the, story, of, king, abimelech, who, was, ordered, by, god, to, do, this, at, shechem, and, various, texts, claim, that, the, roman, general, scipio, aemilianus, africanus, ploughed, over, and, sowed, the, city, of, carthage, with, salt, after, it, was, defeated, in, the, third, punic, war, 146, bc, salt, may, have, been, used, for, barter, in, connection, with, the, obsidian, trade, in, anatolia, in, the, neolithic, era, salt, was, included, among, funeral, offerings, found, in, ancient, egyptian, tombs, from, the, third, millennium, bc, as, were, salted, birds, and, salt, fish, from, about, 2800, bc, the, egyptians, began, exporting, salt, fish, to, the, phoenicians, in, return, for, lebanon, cedar, glass, and, the, dye, tyrian, purple, the, phoenicians, traded, egyptian, salted, fish, and, salt, from, north, africa, throughout, their, mediterranean, trade, empire, herodotus, described, salt, trading, routes, across, libya, back, in, the, 5th, century, bc, in, the, early, years, of, the, roman, empire, roads, were, built, for, the, transportation, of, salt, from, the, salt, imported, at, ostia, to, the, capital, in, africa, salt, was, used, as, currency, south, of, the, sahara, and, slabs, of, rock, salt, were, used, as, coins, in, abyssinia, the, tuareg, have, traditionally, maintained, routes, across, the, sahara, especially, for, the, transportation, of, salt, by, azalai, salt, caravans, the, caravans, still, cross, the, desert, from, southern, niger, to, bilma, although, much, of, the, trade, now, takes, place, by, truck, each, camel, takes, two, bales, of, fodder, and, two, of, trade, goods, northwards, and, returns, laden, with, salt, pillars, and, dates, in, gabon, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, the, coast, people, carried, on, a, remunerative, trade, with, those, of, the, interior, by, the, medium, of, sea, salt, this, was, gradually, displaced, by, the, salt, that, europeans, brought, in, sacks, so, that, the, coast, natives, lost, their, previous, profits, as, of, the, late, 1950s, sea, salt, was, still, the, currency, best, appreciated, in, the, interior, salzburg, hallstatt, and, hallein, lie, within, 17, km, 11, mi, of, each, other, on, the, river, salzach, in, central, austria, in, an, area, with, extensive, salt, deposits, salzach, literally, means, salt, river, and, salzburg, salt, castle, both, taking, their, names, from, the, german, word, salz, meaning, salt, hallstatt, was, the, site, of, the, world, s, first, salt, mine, the, town, gave, its, name, to, the, hallstatt, culture, that, began, mining, for, salt, in, the, area, in, about, 800, bc, around, 400, bc, the, townsfolk, who, had, previously, used, pickaxes, and, shovels, began, open, pan, salt, making, during, the, first, millennium, bc, celtic, communities, grew, rich, trading, salt, and, salted, meat, to, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, in, exchange, for, wine, and, other, luxuries, the, word, salary, comes, from, the, latin, word, for, salt, the, reason, for, this, is, unknown, a, persistent, modern, claim, that, the, roman, legions, were, sometimes, paid, in, salt, is, baseless, the, word, salad, literally, means, salted, and, comes, from, the, ancient, roman, practice, of, salting, leaf, vegetables, wars, have, been, fought, over, salt, venice, fought, and, won, a, war, with, genoa, over, the, product, and, it, played, an, important, part, in, the, american, revolution, cities, on, overland, trade, routes, grew, rich, by, levying, duties, and, towns, like, liverpool, flourished, on, the, export, of, salt, extracted, from, the, salt, mines, of, cheshire, various, governments, have, at, different, times, imposed, salt, taxes, on, their, peoples, the, voyages, of, christopher, columbus, are, said, to, have, been, financed, from, salt, production, in, southern, spain, and, the, oppressive, salt, tax, in, france, was, one, of, the, causes, of, the, french, revolution, after, being, repealed, this, tax, was, reimposed, by, napoleon, when, he, became, emperor, to, pay, for, his, foreign, wars, and, was, not, finally, abolished, until, 1946, in, 1930, mahatma, gandhi, led, a, crowd, of, 100, 000, protestors, on, the, dandi, march, or, salt, satyagraha, during, which, they, made, their, own, salt, from, the, sea, as, a, demonstration, of, their, opposition, to, the, colonial, salt, tax, this, act, of, civil, disobedience, inspired, numerous, indians, and, transformed, the, indian, independence, movement, from, an, elitist, one, with, little, popular, support, into, a, national, struggle, salt, is, mostly, sodium, chloride, nacl, sea, salt, and, mined, salt, may, contain, trace, elements, mined, salt, is, often, refined, salt, crystals, are, translucent, and, cubic, in, shape, they, normally, appear, white, but, impurities, may, give, them, a, blue, or, purple, tinge, when, dissolved, in, water, sodium, chloride, separates, into, na, and, cl, ions, and, the, solubility, is, 359, grams, per, litre, from, cold, solutions, salt, crystallises, as, the, dihydrate, nacl, 2h, 2, o, solutions, of, sodium, chloride, have, very, different, properties, from, those, of, pure, water, the, freezing, point, is, 21, 12, c, 6, 02, f, for, 23, 31, wt, of, salt, and, the, boiling, point, of, saturated, salt, solution, is, around, 108, 7, c, 227, 7, f, salt, is, essential, to, the, health, of, humans, and, other, animals, and, it, is, one, of, the, five, basic, taste, sensations, salt, is, used, in, many, cuisines, and, it, is, often, found, in, salt, shakers, on, diners, eating, tables, for, their, personal, use, on, food, salt, is, also, an, ingredient, in, many, manufactured, foodstuffs, table, salt, is, a, refined, salt, containing, about, 97, to, 99, percent, sodium, chloride, usually, anticaking, agents, such, as, sodium, aluminosilicate, or, magnesium, carbonate, are, added, to, make, it, free, flowing, iodized, salt, containing, potassium, iodide, is, widely, available, some, people, put, a, desiccant, such, as, a, few, grains, of, uncooked, rice, or, a, saltine, cracker, in, their, salt, shakers, to, absorb, extra, moisture, and, help, break, up, salt, clumps, that, may, otherwise, form, some, table, salt, sold, for, consumption, contains, additives, that, address, a, variety, of, health, concerns, especially, in, the, developing, world, the, identities, and, amounts, of, additives, vary, from, country, to, country, iodine, is, an, important, micronutrient, for, humans, and, a, deficiency, of, the, element, can, cause, lowered, production, of, thyroxine, hypothyroidism, and, enlargement, of, the, thyroid, gland, endemic, goitre, in, adults, or, cretinism, in, children, iodized, salt, has, been, used, to, correct, these, conditions, since, 1924, and, consists, of, table, salt, mixed, with, a, minute, amount, of, potassium, iodide, sodium, iodide, or, sodium, iodate, a, small, amount, of, dextrose, may, also, be, added, to, stabilize, the, iodine, iodine, deficiency, affects, about, two, billion, people, around, the, world, and, is, the, leading, preventable, cause, of, intellectual, disabilities, iodized, table, salt, has, significantly, reduced, disorders, of, iodine, deficiency, in, countries, where, it, is, used, the, amount, of, iodine, and, the, specific, iodine, compound, added, to, salt, varies, in, the, united, states, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, recommends, 150, micrograms, of, iodine, per, day, for, both, men, and, women, us, iodized, salt, contains, 46, 77, ppm, parts, per, million, whereas, in, the, uk, the, recommended, iodine, content, of, iodized, salt, is, 10, 22, ppm, sodium, ferrocyanide, also, known, as, yellow, prussiate, of, soda, is, sometimes, added, to, salt, as, an, anticaking, agent, such, anticaking, agents, have, been, added, since, at, least, 1911, when, magnesium, carbonate, was, first, added, to, salt, to, make, it, flow, more, freely, the, safety, of, sodium, ferrocyanide, as, a, food, additive, was, found, to, be, provisionally, acceptable, by, the, committee, on, toxicity, in, 1988, other, anticaking, agents, sometimes, used, include, tricalcium, phosphate, calcium, or, magnesium, carbonates, fatty, acid, salts, acid, salts, magnesium, oxide, silicon, dioxide, calcium, silicate, sodium, aluminosilicate, and, calcium, aluminosilicate, both, the, european, union, and, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, permitted, the, use, of, aluminium, in, the, latter, two, compounds, in, doubly, fortified, salt, both, iodide, and, iron, salts, are, added, the, latter, alleviates, iron, deficiency, anaemia, which, interferes, with, the, mental, development, of, an, estimated, 40, of, infants, in, the, developing, world, a, typical, iron, source, is, ferrous, fumarate, another, additive, especially, important, for, pregnant, women, is, folic, acid, vitamin, b, 9, which, gives, the, table, salt, a, yellow, color, folic, acid, helps, prevent, neural, tube, defects, and, anaemia, which, affect, young, mothers, especially, in, developing, countries, a, lack, of, fluoride, in, the, diet, is, the, cause, of, a, greatly, increased, incidence, of, dental, caries, fluoride, salts, can, be, added, to, table, salt, with, the, goal, of, reducing, tooth, decay, especially, in, countries, that, have, not, benefited, from, fluoridated, toothpastes, and, fluoridated, water, the, practice, is, more, common, in, some, european, countries, where, water, fluoridation, is, not, carried, out, in, france, 35, of, the, table, salt, sold, contains, added, sodium, fluoride, unrefined, sea, salt, contains, small, amounts, of, magnesium, and, calcium, halides, and, sulfates, traces, of, algal, products, salt, resistant, bacteria, and, sediment, particles, the, calcium, and, magnesium, salts, confer, a, faintly, bitter, overtone, and, they, make, unrefined, sea, salt, hygroscopic, i, e, it, gradually, absorbs, moisture, from, air, if, stored, uncovered, algal, products, contribute, a, mildly, fishy, or, sea, air, odour, the, latter, from, organobromine, compounds, sediments, the, proportion, of, which, varies, with, the, source, give, the, salt, a, dull, grey, appearance, since, taste, and, aroma, compounds, are, often, detectable, by, humans, in, minute, concentrations, sea, salt, may, have, a, more, complex, flavor, than, pure, sodium, chloride, when, sprinkled, on, top, of, food, when, salt, is, added, during, cooking, however, these, flavors, would, likely, be, overwhelmed, by, those, of, the, food, ingredients, the, refined, salt, industry, cites, scientific, studies, saying, that, raw, sea, and, rock, salts, do, not, contain, enough, iodine, salts, to, prevent, iodine, deficiency, diseases, salts, have, diverse, mineralities, depending, on, their, source, giving, each, one, a, unique, flavour, fleur, de, sel, a, natural, sea, salt, from, the, surface, of, evaporating, brine, in, salt, pans, has, a, distinctive, flavour, varying, with, its, source, in, traditional, korean, cuisine, so, called, bamboo, salt, is, prepared, by, roasting, salt, in, a, bamboo, container, plugged, with, mud, at, both, ends, this, product, absorbs, minerals, from, the, bamboo, and, the, mud, and, has, been, claimed, to, increase, the, anticlastogenic, and, antimutagenic, properties, of, doenjang, a, fermented, bean, paste, kosher, or, kitchen, salt, has, a, larger, grain, size, than, table, salt, and, is, used, in, cooking, it, can, be, useful, for, brining, in, bread, or, pretzel, making, and, as, a, scrubbing, agent, when, combined, with, oil, pickling, salt, is, made, of, ultra, fine, grains, to, speed, dissolving, to, make, brine, salt, is, present, in, most, foods, but, in, naturally, occurring, foodstuffs, such, as, meats, vegetables, and, fruit, it, is, present, in, very, small, quantities, it, is, often, added, to, processed, foods, such, as, canned, foods, and, especially, salted, foods, pickled, foods, and, snack, foods, or, other, convenience, foods, where, it, functions, as, both, a, preservative, and, a, flavoring, dairy, salt, is, used, in, the, preparation, of, butter, and, cheese, products, as, a, flavoring, salt, enhances, the, taste, of, other, foods, by, suppressing, the, bitterness, of, those, foods, making, them, more, palatable, and, relatively, sweeter, before, the, advent, of, electrically, powered, refrigeration, salting, was, one, of, the, main, methods, of, food, preservation, thus, herring, contains, 67, mg, sodium, per, 100, g, while, kipper, its, preserved, form, contains, 990, mg, similarly, pork, typically, contains, 63, mg, while, bacon, contains, 1, 480, mg, and, potatoes, contain, 7, mg, but, potato, crisps, 800, mg, per, 100, g, salt, is, also, used, extensively, in, cooking, as, a, flavoring, and, cooking, techniques, such, as, with, salt, crusts, and, brining, the, main, sources, of, salt, in, the, western, diet, apart, from, direct, use, of, sodium, chloride, are, bread, and, cereal, products, meat, products, and, milk, and, dairy, products, in, many, east, asian, cultures, salt, is, not, traditionally, used, as, a, condiment, in, its, place, condiments, such, as, soy, sauce, fish, sauce, and, oyster, sauce, tend, to, have, a, high, sodium, content, and, fill, a, similar, role, to, table, salt, in, western, cultures, they, are, most, often, used, for, cooking, rather, than, as, table, condiments, human, salt, taste, is, detected, by, sodium, taste, receptors, present, in, taste, bud, cells, on, the, tongue, human, sensory, taste, testing, studies, have, shown, that, proteolyzed, forms, of, epithelial, sodium, channel, enac, function, as, the, human, salt, taste, receptor, table, salt, is, made, up, of, just, under, 40, sodium, by, weight, so, a, 6, g, serving, 1, teaspoon, contains, about, 2, 400, mg, of, sodium, sodium, serves, a, vital, purpose, in, the, human, body, via, its, role, as, an, electrolyte, it, helps, nerves, and, muscles, to, function, correctly, and, it, is, one, factor, involved, in, the, osmotic, regulation, of, water, content, in, body, organs, fluid, balance, most, of, the, sodium, in, the, western, diet, comes, from, salt, the, habitual, salt, intake, in, many, western, countries, is, about, 10, g, per, day, and, it, is, higher, than, that, in, many, countries, in, eastern, europe, and, asia, the, high, level, of, sodium, in, many, processed, foods, has, a, major, impact, on, the, total, amount, consumed, in, the, united, states, 75, of, the, sodium, eaten, comes, from, processed, and, restaurant, foods, 11, from, cooking, and, table, use, and, the, rest, from, what, is, found, naturally, in, foodstuffs, because, consuming, too, much, sodium, increases, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, health, organizations, generally, recommend, that, people, reduce, their, dietary, intake, of, salt, high, sodium, intake, is, associated, with, a, greater, risk, of, stroke, total, cardiovascular, disease, and, kidney, disease, a, reduction, in, sodium, intake, by, 1, 000, mg, per, day, may, reduce, cardiovascular, disease, by, about, 30, percent, in, adults, and, children, with, no, acute, illness, a, decrease, in, the, intake, of, sodium, from, the, typical, high, levels, reduces, blood, pressure, a, low, sodium, diet, results, in, a, greater, improvement, in, blood, pressure, in, people, with, hypertension, the, world, health, organization, recommends, that, adults, should, consume, less, than, 2, 000, mg, of, sodium, which, is, contained, in, 5, g, of, salt, per, day, guidelines, by, the, united, states, recommend, that, people, with, hypertension, african, americans, and, middle, aged, and, older, adults, should, limit, consumption, to, no, more, than, 1, 500, mg, of, sodium, per, day, and, meet, the, potassium, recommendation, of, 4, 700, mg, day, with, a, healthy, diet, of, fruits, and, vegetables, while, reduction, of, sodium, intake, to, less, than, 2, 300, mg, per, day, is, recommended, by, developed, countries, one, review, recommended, that, sodium, intake, be, reduced, to, at, least, 1, 200, mg, contained, in, 3, g, of, salt, per, day, as, a, further, reduction, in, salt, intake, led, to, a, greater, fall, in, systolic, blood, pressure, for, all, age, groups, and, ethnicities, another, review, indicated, that, there, is, inconsistent, insufficient, evidence, to, conclude, that, reducing, sodium, intake, to, lower, than, 2, 300, mg, per, day, is, either, beneficial, or, harmful, evidence, shows, a, more, complicated, relationship, between, salt, and, cardiovascular, disease, the, association, between, sodium, consumption, and, cardiovascular, disease, or, mortality, is, u, shaped, with, increased, risk, at, both, high, and, low, sodium, intake, the, findings, showed, that, increased, mortality, from, excessive, salt, intake, was, primarily, associated, with, individuals, with, hypertension, the, levels, of, increased, mortality, among, those, with, restricted, salt, intake, appeared, to, be, similar, regardless, of, blood, pressure, this, evidence, shows, that, while, those, with, hypertension, should, primarily, focus, on, reducing, sodium, to, recommended, levels, all, groups, should, seek, to, maintain, a, healthy, level, of, sodium, intake, of, between, 4, and, 5, grams, equivalent, to, 10, 13, g, salt, a, day, one, of, the, two, most, prominent, dietary, risks, for, disability, in, the, world, are, diets, high, in, sodium, only, a, small, percentage, of, the, salt, manufactured, in, the, world, is, used, in, food, the, remainder, is, used, in, agriculture, water, treatment, chemical, production, de, icing, and, other, industrial, use, cases, sodium, chloride, is, one, of, the, largest, volume, inorganic, raw, materials, it, is, a, feedstock, in, the, production, of, caustic, soda, and, chlorine, these, are, used, in, the, manufacture, of, pvc, paper, pulp, and, many, other, inorganic, and, organic, compounds, salt, is, also, used, as, a, flux, in, the, production, of, aluminium, for, this, purpose, a, layer, of, melted, salt, floats, on, top, of, the, molten, metal, and, removes, iron, and, other, metal, contaminants, it, is, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, soaps, and, glycerine, where, it, is, used, to, saponify, fats, as, an, emulsifier, salt, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, synthetic, rubber, and, another, use, is, in, the, firing, of, pottery, when, salt, added, to, the, furnace, vaporises, before, condensing, onto, the, surface, of, the, ceramic, material, forming, a, strong, glaze, when, drilling, through, loose, materials, such, as, sand, or, gravel, salt, may, be, added, to, the, drilling, fluid, to, provide, a, stable, wall, to, prevent, the, hole, collapsing, there, are, many, other, processes, in, which, salt, is, involved, these, include, its, use, as, a, mordant, in, textile, dying, to, regenerate, resins, in, water, softening, for, the, tanning, of, hides, the, preservation, of, meat, and, fish, and, the, canning, of, meat, and, vegetables, food, grade, salt, accounts, for, only, a, small, part, of, salt, production, in, industrialized, countries, 7, in, europe, although, worldwide, food, uses, account, for, 17, 5, of, total, production, in, 2018, total, world, production, of, salt, was, 300, million, tonnes, the, top, six, producers, being, china, 68, million, the, united, states, 42, million, india, 29, million, germany, 13, million, canada, 13, million, and, australia, 12, million, the, manufacture, of, salt, is, one, of, the, oldest, chemical, industries, a, major, source, of, salt, is, seawater, which, has, a, salinity, of, approximately, 3, 5, this, means, that, there, are, about, 35, g, 1, 2, oz, of, dissolved, salts,
