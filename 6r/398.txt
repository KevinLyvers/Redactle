figure, skating, is, a, sport, in, which, individuals, pairs, or, groups, perform, on, figure, skates, on, ice, it, was, the, first, winter, sport, to, be, included, in, the, olympic, games, with, its, introduction, occurring, at, the, 1908, olympics, in, london, the, olympic, disciplines, are, men, s, singles, women, s, singles, pair, skating, and, ice, dance, the, four, individual, disciplines, are, also, combined, into, a, team, event, which, was, first, included, in, the, winter, olympics, in, 2014, the, non, olympic, disciplines, include, synchronized, skating, theater, on, ice, and, four, skating, from, intermediate, through, senior, level, competition, skaters, generally, perform, two, programs, the, short, program, and, the, free, skate, which, depending, on, the, discipline, may, include, spins, jumps, moves, in, the, field, lifts, throw, jumps, death, spirals, and, other, elements, or, moves, figure, skaters, compete, at, various, levels, from, beginner, up, to, the, olympic, level, senior, at, local, regional, sectional, national, and, international, competitions, the, international, skating, union, isu, regulates, international, figure, skating, judging, and, competitions, these, include, the, winter, olympics, the, world, championships, the, world, junior, championships, the, european, championships, the, four, continents, championships, the, grand, prix, series, senior, and, junior, and, the, isu, challenger, series, the, sport, is, also, associated, with, show, business, major, competitions, generally, conclude, with, exhibition, galas, in, which, the, top, skaters, from, each, discipline, perform, non, competitive, programs, many, skaters, both, during, and, after, their, competitive, careers, also, skate, in, ice, shows, which, run, during, the, competitive, season, and, the, off, season, the, term, professional, in, skating, refers, not, to, skill, level, but, competitive, status, figure, skaters, competing, at, the, highest, levels, of, international, competition, are, not, professional, skaters, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, amateurs, even, though, some, earn, money, professional, skaters, include, those, who, have, lost, their, isu, eligibility, and, those, who, perform, only, in, shows, they, may, also, include, former, olympic, and, world, champions, who, have, ended, their, competitive, career, as, well, as, skaters, with, little, or, no, international, competitive, experience, in, addition, to, performing, in, ice, shows, professional, skaters, often, compete, in, professional, competitions, which, are, held, throughout, the, world, each, with, its, own, format, and, rules, the, term, figure, skating, is, an, english, language, term, the, sport, is, called, eiskunstlauf, in, german, and, patinage, artistique, in, french, the, most, visible, difference, from, ice, hockey, skates, is, that, figure, skates, have, a, set, of, large, jagged, teeth, called, toe, picks, on, the, front, part, of, the, blade, these, are, used, primarily, in, jumping, and, should, not, be, used, for, stroking, or, spins, if, used, during, a, spin, the, toe, pick, will, cause, the, skater, to, lose, momentum, or, move, away, from, the, center, of, the, spin, blades, are, mounted, to, the, sole, and, heel, of, the, boot, with, screws, typically, high, level, figure, skaters, are, professionally, fitted, for, their, boots, and, blades, at, a, reputable, skate, shop, professionals, are, also, employed, to, sharpen, blades, to, individual, requirements, blades, are, about, 4, 7, millimetres, 3, 16, inch, thick, when, viewed, from, the, side, the, blade, of, a, figure, skate, is, not, flat, but, curved, slightly, forming, an, arc, of, a, circle, with, a, radius, of, 180, 220, centimetres, 71, 87, inches, this, curvature, is, referred, to, as, the, rocker, of, the, blade, the, sweet, spot, is, the, part, of, the, blade, on, which, all, spins, are, rotated, this, is, usually, located, near, the, stanchion, of, the, blade, below, the, ball, of, the, foot, the, blade, is, also, hollow, ground, a, groove, on, the, bottom, of, the, blade, creates, two, distinct, edges, inside, and, outside, the, inside, edge, of, the, blade, is, on, the, side, closest, to, the, skater, the, outside, edge, of, the, blade, is, on, the, side, farthest, from, the, skater, in, figure, skating, it, is, always, desirable, to, skate, on, only, one, edge, of, the, blade, skating, on, both, at, the, same, time, which, is, referred, to, as, a, flat, may, result, in, lower, skating, skills, scores, the, apparently, effortless, power, and, glide, across, the, ice, exhibited, by, elite, figure, skaters, fundamentally, derives, from, efficient, use, of, the, edges, to, generate, speed, skates, used, in, singles, and, pair, skating, have, a, set, of, large, jagged, teeth, called, a, toepick, on, the, front, of, each, blade, the, toepicks, are, mainly, used, to, help, launch, the, skater, into, the, air, for, the, take, off, when, performing, jumps, ice, dance, blades, have, smaller, toepicks, than, blades, used, for, the, other, disciplines, during, a, spin, skaters, use, the, sweet, spot, of, the, blade, which, is, one, of, two, rockers, to, be, found, on, a, blade, and, is, the, roundest, portion, of, the, blade, the, sweet, spot, is, located, just, behind, the, toe, pick, and, near, the, middle, of, the, blade, the, other, rocker, is, the, more, general, curvature, of, the, blade, when, stroking, or, gliding, ice, dancers, blades, are, about, an, inch, shorter, in, the, rear, than, those, used, by, skaters, in, other, disciplines, to, accommodate, the, intricate, footwork, and, close, partnering, in, dance, dancers, blades, also, have, a, smaller, toepick, as, they, do, not, require, the, large, toepick, used, for, jumping, in, the, other, disciplines, hard, plastic, skate, guards, are, used, when, the, skater, must, walk, in, his, or, her, skates, when, not, on, the, ice, to, protect, the, blade, from, dirt, or, material, on, the, ground, that, may, dull, the, blade, soft, blade, covers, called, soakers, are, used, to, absorb, condensation, and, protect, the, blades, from, rust, when, the, skates, are, not, being, worn, in, competition, skaters, are, allowed, three, minutes, to, make, repairs, to, their, skates, there, are, many, different, types, of, boots, and, blades, to, suit, different, disciplines, and, abilities, for, example, athletes, who, are, performing, advanced, multi, rotational, jumps, often, need, a, stiffer, boot, that, is, higher, and, gives, more, support, athletes, working, on, single, or, double, jumps, require, less, support, and, may, use, a, less, stiff, boot, ice, dancers, may, prefer, a, lower, cut, boot, that, is, designed, to, enable, more, knee, bend, likewise, blades, designed, for, free, and, pairs, skating, have, a, longer, tail, to, assist, landing, the, blade, profile, and, picks, are, designed, to, assist, with, spinning, jump, entry, take, off, landing, and, exit, modern, blade, technology, increasingly, uses, carbon, fibre, and, materials, other, than, steel, to, make, blades, lighter, these, materials, may, also, be, more, flexible, and, help, cushion, jump, landings, and, be, protective, of, young, athlete, s, joints, ice, dance, blades, have, short, tails, to, enable, close, foot, work, and, reduce, the, risk, of, blade, clash, in, close, complex, moves, they, may, also, be, thinner, to, assist, with, glide, and, fast, changes, of, edge, off, ice, training, is, the, term, for, physical, conditioning, that, takes, place, off, the, ice, besides, regular, physical, exercise, skaters, do, walk, throughs, of, jumps, off, the, ice, to, practice, sufficient, rotation, and, height, of, their, jumps, and, to, practice, consistency, in, landing, on, one, foot, in, 2020, 2021, many, athletes, relied, on, a, variety, of, off, ice, training, and, conditioning, methods, due, to, rinks, being, closed, due, to, covid, 19, since, 1980, all, figure, skating, competitions, must, be, held, in, completely, covered, and, enclosed, rinks, the, rule, was, expanded, to, include, practice, rinks, in, 1984, according, to, figure, skating, historian, james, r, hines, the, development, of, indoor, ice, rinks, other, than, the, development, of, the, bladed, skate, during, the, 14th, century, and, the, practice, of, fastening, boots, permanently, to, skates, in, the, 19th, century, has, had, the, greatest, effect, on, figure, skating, it, allowed, for, skating, year, round, as, well, as, anywhere, in, the, world, and, prevented, the, cancellation, of, competitive, events, due, to, the, lack, of, ice, in, outdoor, rinks, the, first, attempts, to, make, artificial, ice, occurred, during, the, 1870s, in, england, and, the, u, s, the, first, notable, indoor, ice, rink, was, made, in, 1876, by, john, gamgee, in, chelsea, along, the, north, bank, of, the, thames, river, it, measured, 24, by, 40, feet, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, many, major, cities, in, europe, and, north, america, had, indoor, rinks, there, is, significant, variation, in, the, dimensions, of, ice, rinks, olympic, sized, rinks, have, dimensions, of, 30, m, 60, m, 98, 4, ft, 197, ft, nhl, sized, rinks, are, 26, m, 61, m, 85, ft, 200, ft, while, european, rinks, are, sometimes, 30, m, 64, m, 98, ft, 210, ft, the, isu, prefers, olympic, sized, rinks, for, figure, skating, competitions, particularly, for, major, events, according, to, isu, rule, 342, a, figure, skating, rink, for, an, isu, event, if, possible, shall, measure, sixty, 60, meters, in, one, direction, and, thirty, 30, meters, in, the, other, but, not, larger, and, not, less, than, fifty, six, 56, meters, in, one, direction, and, twenty, six, 26, meters, in, the, other, the, scoring, system, rewards, skaters, who, have, good, ice, coverage, i, e, those, who, efficiently, cover, the, entire, ice, surface, during, their, programs, olympic, sized, rinks, make, the, differences, in, skill, between, skaters, more, apparent, but, they, are, not, available, for, all, events, if, a, rink, has, different, dimensions, a, skater, s, jump, setup, and, speed, may, be, hindered, as, he, or, she, adjusts, ice, quality, is, judged, by, smoothness, friction, hardness, and, brittleness, factors, affecting, ice, quality, include, temperature, water, quality, and, usage, with, toe, picks, causing, more, deterioration, for, figure, skating, the, ice, surface, temperature, is, normally, maintained, between, 5, 5, and, 3, 5, c, 22, 1, and, 25, 7, f, with, the, olympic, disciplines, requiring, slightly, softer, ice, 3, 5, c, than, synchronized, skating, 5, 5, c, typically, after, every, two, warm, up, groups, an, ice, resurfacer, cleans, and, smooths, the, surface, of, the, ice, sheet, inadequate, ice, quality, may, affect, skaters, performances, some, rinks, have, a, harness, system, installed, to, help, skaters, learn, new, jumps, in, a, controlled, manner, a, heavy, duty, cable, is, securely, attached, to, two, of, the, walls, around, the, ice, with, a, set, of, pulleys, riding, on, the, cable, the, skater, wears, a, vest, or, belt, with, a, cable, or, rope, attached, to, it, and, the, cable, rope, is, threaded, through, the, movable, pulley, on, the, cable, above, the, coach, holds, the, other, end, of, the, cable, and, lifts, the, skater, by, pulling, the, cable, rope, the, skater, can, then, practice, the, jump, with, the, coach, assisting, the, completion, this, is, used, when, a, skater, needs, more, help, on, a, jump, however, if, the, coaches, see, fit, they, could, use, another, harness, usually, called, the, fishing, pole, harness, it, is, named, that, because, it, looks, similar, to, a, fishing, pole, the, skater, will, put, on, the, harness, and, the, coach, will, adjust, it, so, it, fits, the, skater, the, skater, will, go, and, do, the, jump, with, very, little, help, from, their, coach, they, can, also, do, the, jump, on, any, pattern, they, choose, whereas, the, other, harness, they, must, do, in, a, straight, line, figure, skating, consists, of, the, following, disciplines, each, element, receives, a, score, according, to, its, base, value, and, grade, of, execution, goe, resulting, in, a, combined, technical, elements, score, tes, at, competitions, a, technical, specialist, identifies, the, elements, and, assigns, each, one, a, level, of, difficulty, ranging, from, b, basic, to, level, 4, most, difficult, for, each, element, a, panel, of, judges, determines, the, goe, ranging, between, 5, and, 5, according, to, how, well, the, skater, executes, the, element, the, goe, is, weighted, according, to, the, base, value, of, the, element, through, the, isu, guidelines, skaters, must, perform, a, minimum, of, seven, elements, in, their, short, program, and, twelve, elements, in, their, long, program, the, isu, defines, a, fall, as, a, loss, of, control, with, the, result, that, the, majority, of, the, skater, s, body, weight, is, not, on, the, blade, but, supported, by, hands, knees, or, buttocks, jumps, involve, the, skater, leaping, into, the, air, and, rotating, rapidly, to, land, after, completing, one, or, more, rotations, there, are, many, types, of, jumps, identified, by, the, way, the, skater, takes, off, and, lands, as, well, as, by, the, number, of, rotations, that, are, completed, each, jump, receives, a, score, according, to, its, base, value, and, grade, of, execution, goe, quality, of, execution, technique, height, speed, flow, and, ice, coverage, are, considered, by, the, judges, an, under, rotated, jump, indicated, by, is, missing, rotation, of, more, than, 1, 4, but, less, than, 1, 2, revolution, and, receives, 70, of, the, base, value, a, downgraded, jump, indicated, by, is, missing, rotation, of, 1, 2, revolution, or, more, a, downgraded, triple, is, treated, as, a, double, jump, while, a, downgraded, double, is, treated, as, a, single, jump, an, edge, violation, occurs, when, a, skater, executes, a, jump, on, the, incorrect, edge, the, hollow, is, a, groove, on, the, bottom, of, the, blade, which, creates, two, distinct, edges, inside, and, outside, the, inside, edge, of, the, blade, is, on, the, side, closest, to, the, skater, the, outside, edge, is, on, the, side, farthest, from, the, skater, and, a, flat, refers, to, skating, on, both, edges, at, the, same, time, which, is, discouraged, an, unclear, edge, or, edge, violation, is, indicated, with, an, e, and, reflected, in, the, goe, according, to, the, severity, of, the, problem, flutz, and, lip, are, the, colloquial, terms, for, a, lutz, and, flip, jump, with, an, edge, violation, in, 1982, the, isu, enacted, a, rule, stating, that, a, skater, may, perform, each, type, of, triple, only, once, in, a, program, or, twice, if, one, of, them, is, incorporated, into, a, combination, or, sequence, for, a, set, of, jumps, to, be, considered, a, combination, each, jump, must, take, off, from, the, landing, edge, of, the, previous, jump, with, no, steps, turns, or, change, of, edge, between, jumps, toe, loops, and, loops, are, commonly, performed, as, the, second, or, third, jump, in, a, combination, because, they, take, off, from, the, back, outside, edge, of, the, landing, foot, or, skating, leg, to, perform, a, salchow, or, flip, on, the, back, end, of, a, combination, a, half, loop, which, is, actually, a, full, rotation, but, lands, on, a, back, inside, edge, of, the, landing, leg, may, be, used, as, a, connecting, jump, in, contrast, jump, sequences, are, sets, of, jumps, that, may, be, linked, by, non, listed, jumps, or, hops, sequences, are, worth, 80, of, the, combined, value, of, the, same, jumps, executed, in, combination, a, figure, skater, only, needs, to, be, able, to, jump, in, one, direction, either, clockwise, or, counter, clockwise, the, vast, majority, of, figure, skaters, prefer, to, rotate, in, a, counter, clockwise, direction, when, jumping, thus, for, clarity, all, jumps, will, be, described, for, a, skater, jumping, counter, clockwise, there, are, six, jumps, in, figure, skating, that, count, as, jump, elements, all, six, are, landed, on, one, foot, on, the, back, outside, edge, with, counter, clockwise, rotation, for, single, and, multi, revolution, jumps, but, have, different, takeoffs, by, which, they, may, be, distinguished, jumps, are, divided, into, two, different, categories, toe, jumps, and, edge, jumps, the, number, of, rotations, performed, in, the, air, determines, whether, the, jump, is, a, single, double, triple, or, quadruple, commonly, known, as, a, quad, the, simplest, jump, is, a, waltz, jump, which, can, only, be, done, in, a, half, leap, and, is, not, classified, as, a, single, double, or, triple, jump, triple, jumps, other, than, the, triple, axel, are, commonly, performed, by, female, single, skaters, it, is, rare, for, a, female, skater, to, land, a, quadruple, jump, and, very, few, female, single, skaters, have, been, credited, with, quads, in, competition, senior, level, male, single, skaters, perform, mostly, triple, and, quadruple, jumps, in, competition, the, final, of, the, six, jumps, to, be, landed, cleanly, as, a, quad, in, international, competition, is, the, elusive, quadruple, axel, a, few, male, skaters, made, valiant, efforts, to, land, the, immensely, difficult, four, and, a, half, revolution, jump, most, notably, two, time, olympic, champion, from, japan, yuzuru, hanyu, but, failed, to, land, one, cleanly, and, fully, rotated, the, first, clean, and, fully, rotated, quad, axel, was, successfully, landed, by, american, men, s, skater, ilia, malinin, at, the, 2022, cs, u, s, classic, 34, years, after, the, first, ever, quadruple, jump, a, quad, toe, loop, was, landed, by, canada, s, kurt, browning, at, the, world, figure, skating, championships, in, 1988, some, elite, skaters, can, complete, a, jump, in, about, one, second, with, 26, inches, of, height, and, 10, feet, in, distance, the, takeoff, speed, of, a, jump, can, reach, up, to, 15, mph, prior, to, most, jumps, a, figure, skater, needs, to, skate, backward, to, build, power, and, speed, toe, jumps, are, launched, by, digging, the, toe, pick, of, one, skate, into, the, ice, using, it, to, vault, into, the, air, with, the, opposite, leg, the, main, toe, jumps, are, in, order, of, score, value, all, of, the, above, descriptions, assume, a, counter, clockwise, direction, of, rotation, landing, backwards, on, the, outside, edge, of, the, right, foot, for, clockwise, rotation, the, skater, takes, off, using, the, alternative, foot, and, lands, backwards, on, the, outside, edge, of, the, left, foot, edge, jumps, use, no, toe, assist, and, include, in, order, of, score, value, again, these, descriptions, assume, a, counter, clockwise, direction, of, rotation, landing, backwards, on, the, outside, edge, of, the, right, foot, for, clockwise, rotation, the, skater, takes, off, using, the, alternative, foot, and, always, lands, backwards, on, the, outside, edge, of, the, left, foot, several, other, jumps, are, usually, performed, only, as, single, jumps, and, in, elite, skating, are, used, as, transitional, movements, or, highlights, in, step, sequences, these, include, the, half, toe, loop, ballet, jump, half, loop, half, flip, walley, jump, waltz, jump, inside, axel, one, foot, axel, stag, jump, and, split, jump, there, are, two, kinds, of, split, jump, spins, are, an, element, in, which, the, skater, rotates, centered, on, a, single, point, on, the, ice, while, holding, one, or, more, body, positions, they, are, performed, by, all, disciplines, of, the, sport, as, the, new, york, times, says, while, jumps, look, like, sport, spins, look, more, like, art, while, jumps, provide, the, suspense, spins, provide, the, scenery, but, there, is, so, much, more, to, the, scenery, than, most, viewers, have, time, or, means, to, grasp, according, to, world, champion, and, figure, skating, commentator, scott, hamilton, spins, are, often, used, as, breathing, points, or, transitions, to, bigger, things, figure, skating, spins, along, with, jumps, spirals, and, spread, eagles, were, originally, individual, compulsory, figures, sometimes, special, figures, unlike, jumps, spins, were, a, graceful, and, appreciated, part, of, figure, skating, throughout, the, 19th, century, they, advanced, between, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, by, the, late, 1930s, all, three, basic, spin, positions, were, used, there, are, two, types, of, spins, the, forward, spin, and, the, backward, spin, there, are, three, basic, spin, positions, the, upright, spin, the, sit, spin, and, the, camel, spin, skaters, also, perform, flying, spins, and, combination, spins, figure, skating, lifts, are, required, elements, in, pair, skating, and, ice, dance, there, are, five, groups, of, lifts, in, pair, skating, categorized, in, order, of, increasing, level, of, difficulty, judges, look, for, the, following, when, evaluating, pair, lifts, speed, of, entry, and, exit, control, of, the, woman, s, free, leg, when, she, is, exiting, out, of, the, lift, with, the, goal, of, keeping, the, leg, high, and, sweeping, the, position, of, the, woman, in, the, air, the, man, s, footwork, quick, and, easy, changes, of, position, and, the, maintenance, of, flow, throughout, the, lift, twist, lifts, are, the, most, thrilling, and, exciting, component, in, pair, skating, they, can, also, be, the, most, difficult, movement, to, perform, correctly, they, require, more, strength, and, coordination, than, many, other, pair, elements, and, are, usually, the, first, or, second, element, in, a, program, according, to, the, international, skating, union, isu, the, woman, must, be, caught, in, the, air, at, the, waist, by, the, man, prior, to, landing, and, be, assisted, to, a, smooth, landing, on, the, ice, on, a, backward, outside, edge, on, one, foot, during, a, twist, lift, the, isu, defines, dance, lifts, as, a, movement, in, which, one, of, the, partners, is, elevated, with, active, and, or, passive, assistance, of, the, other, partner, to, any, permitted, height, sustained, there, and, set, down, on, the, ice, dance, lifts, are, delineated, from, pair, lifts, to, ensure, that, ice, dance, and, pair, skating, remain, separate, disciplines, after, the, judging, system, changed, from, the, 6, 0, system, to, the, isu, judging, system, ijs, dance, lifts, became, more, athletic, dramatic, and, exciting, there, are, two, types, of, dance, lifts, short, lifts, which, should, be, done, in, under, seven, seconds, and, combination, lifts, which, should, be, done, in, under, 12, seconds, a, well, balanced, free, dance, program, in, ice, dance, must, include, dance, lifts, along, with, other, forms, of, skating, figure, skating, is, one, of, the, only, human, powered, activities, where, travelling, backwards, is, integral, to, the, discipline, the, ability, to, skate, well, backwards, and, forwards, are, considered, to, be, equally, important, as, is, the, ability, to, transition, well, between, the, two, step, sequences, are, a, required, element, in, all, four, olympic, disciplines, the, pattern, can, be, straight, line, circular, or, serpentine, the, step, sequence, consists, of, a, combination, of, turns, steps, hops, and, edge, changes, additionally, steps, and, turns, can, be, used, as, transitions, between, elements, the, various, turns, which, skaters, can, incorporate, into, step, sequences, include, choctaws, are, the, two, foot, equivalents, of, rockers, and, counters, other, movements, that, may, be, incorporated, into, step, sequences, or, used, as, connecting, elements, include, lunges, and, spread, eagles, an, ina, bauer, is, similar, to, a, spread, eagle, performed, with, one, knee, bent, and, typically, an, arched, back, hydroblading, refers, to, a, deep, edge, performed, with, the, body, as, low, as, possible, to, the, ice, in, a, near, horizontal, position, moves, in, the, field, is, a, pre, determined, required, sequence, that, demonstrated, basic, skating, skills, and, edge, control, in, the, context, of, a, competitive, program, they, include, sequences, that, may, include, spirals, spread, eagles, ina, bauers, hydroblading, and, similar, extended, edge, moves, along, with, loops, twizzles, and, different, kinds, of, turns, a, spiral, is, an, element, in, which, the, skater, moves, across, the, ice, on, a, specific, edge, with, the, free, leg, held, at, hip, level, or, above, spirals, are, distinguished, by, the, edge, of, the, blade, used, inside, or, outside, the, direction, of, motion, forward, or, backward, and, the, skater, s, position, a, spiral, sequence, is, one, or, more, spiral, positions, and, edges, done, in, sequence, judges, look, at, the, depth, stability, and, control, of, the, skating, edge, speed, and, ice, coverage, extension, and, other, factors, some, skaters, can, change, edges, during, a,

olympics, the, isu, adopted, the, international, judging, system, ijs, which, became, mandatory, at, all, international, competitions, in, 2006, including, the, 2006, winter, olympics, the, new, system, is, sometimes, informally, referred, to, as, the, code, of, points, however, the, isu, has, never, used, the, term, to, describe, their, system, in, any, of, their, official, communications, under, the, ijs, points, are, awarded, individually, for, each, skating, element, and, the, sum, of, these, points, is, the, total, element, score, tes, competitive, programs, are, constrained, to, include, a, set, number, of, elements, each, element, is, judged, first, by, a, technical, specialist, who, identifies, the, specific, element, and, determines, its, base, value, this, is, done, using, instant, replay, video, to, verify, features, that, distinguish, different, elements, e, g, the, exact, foot, position, at, take, off, and, landing, of, a, jump, a, panel, of, nine, judges, then, each, award, a, mark, for, the, quality, and, execution, of, the, element, this, mark, called, the, grade, of, execution, goe, is, an, integer, with, a, minimum, value, of, 5, and, a, maximum, value, of, 5, the, goe, mark, is, then, translated, into, another, value, by, using, the, table, of, values, in, isu, rule, 322, the, goe, value, from, the, nine, judges, is, then, processed, with, a, computerized, random, selection, of, nine, judges, the, highest, and, lowest, values, are, then, discarded, and, finally, the, average, of, the, remaining, seven, is, calculated, this, average, value, is, then, added, to, or, subtracted, from, the, base, value, to, determine, the, total, value, for, the, element, note, the, ijs, previously, used, a, goe, scale, of, 3, to, 3, but, this, was, changed, for, the, 2018, 19, season, and, is, in, the, early, stages, of, being, tested, in, competitions, the, program, components, score, pcs, awards, points, to, holistic, aspects, of, a, program,

each, component, a, raw, mark, from, 0, to, 10, in, increments, of, 0, 25, with, a, mark, of, 5, being, defined, as, average, for, each, separate, component, the, raw, marks, are, then, selected, trimmed, and, averaged, in, a, manner, akin, to, determining, a, grade, of, execution, the, trimmed, mean, scores, are, then, translated, into, a, factored, mark, by, multiplying, by, a, factor, that, depends, on, the, discipline, competition, segment, and, level, then, the, five, or, four, factored, marks, are, added, to, give, the, final, pcs, score, the, total, element, score, and, the, program,

events, no, more, than, three, from, each, country, and, varying, numbers, of, high, level, skaters, in, each, country, skaters, from, some, countries, may, find, it, more, difficult, to, qualify, to, compete, at, major, events, thus, a, skater, with, a, lower, sb, but, from, a, country, with, few, high, level, skaters, may, qualify, to, a, major, event, while, a, skater, with, a, much, higher, sb, but, from, a, country, with, more, than, three, high, level, skaters, may, not, be, sent, as, a, result, it, is, possible, for, a, skater, who, regularly, scores, higher, to, end, up, with, a, much, lower, world, standing, the, season, s, world, ranking, of, a, skater, couple, is, calculated, similarly, to, the, overall, world, standing, but, is, based, on, the, results, of, the, ongoing, season, only, the, season, s, best, sb, of, a, skater, couple, is, the, highest, score, achieved, within, a, particular, season, there, is, an, sb, for, the, combined, total, score, and, the, individual,

career, in, terms, of, combined, total, and, segment, scores, however, pb, scores, are, not, completely, comparable, if, achieved, in, different, seasons, because, the, isu, regulations, and, technical, rules, are, modified, before, each, new, season, there, may, be, different, requirements, specified, to, achieve, a, certain, level, the, required, elements, may, change, and, new, elements, may, be, allowed, for, example, two, quads, in, the, short, program, were, permitted, starting, in, the, 2010, 11, season, and, the, point, values, may, change, for, example, the, values, of, quads, were, increased, after, the, 2010, olympics, and, a, second, step, sequence, is, no, longer, assigned, a, level, in, the, men, s, competition, as, a, result, of, these, variations, in, the, technical, requirements, the, isu, places, more, weight, on, the, season, s, bests, which, are, fully, comparable, within, any, one, season, for, competitive, programs, figure, skaters, were, once, restricted, to, instrumental, music, vocals, were, allowed, only, if, they, contained, no, lyrics, or, words, beginning, in, the, 1997, 98, season, the, isu, decided, to, allow, lyrics, or, words, in, ice, dance, music, although, the, rules, were, not, relaxed, for, singles, and, pairs, judges, did, not, always, penalize, violations, at, the, 2011, world, championships, florent, amodio, s, long, program, music, included, words, but, an, insufficient, number, of, judges, voted, for, a, deduction, in, june, 2012, the, isu, voted, to, allow, skaters, from, all, disciplines, to, choose, music, with, words, in, their, competitive, programs, beginning, in, the, 2014, 15, season, skaters, may, use, professional, music, editors, so, that, their, music, meets, requirements, ice, dancers, are, required, to, skate, to, music, that, has, a, definite, beat, or, rhythm, singles, and, pair, skaters, more, often, skate, to, the, melody, and, phrasing, of, their, music, for, long, programs, figure, skaters, generally, search, for, music, with, different, moods, and, tempos, music, selections, for, exhibitions, are, less, constrained, than, for, competitive, programs, skaters, are, generally, free, to, select, their, own, attire, with, a, few, restrictions, in, competition, women, may, wear, a, dress, typically, with, matching, attached, briefs, this, rule, of, costuming, was, created, in, response, to, katarina, witt, s, costume, and, performance, at, the, 1988, winter, olympics, in, 2004, the, rule, was, extended, to, allow, women, to, wear, trousers, they, may, wear, opaque, flesh, colored, leggings, or, tights, under, dresses, and, skirts, which, may, extend, to, cover, their, skates, men, must, wear, trousers, they, are, not, allowed, to, wear, tights, although, officials, do, not, always, impose, a, deduction, for, violations, matching, costumes, are, not, required, in, pair, skating, and, ice, dance, competition, costumes, vary, widely, from, simple, designs, to, heavily, beaded, or, trimmed, costumes, skaters, risk, a, deduction, if, a, piece, of, their, costume, falls, onto, the, ice, surface, an, official, may, stop, a, program, if, he, or, she, deems, there, to, be, a, hazard, skaters, and, family, members, may, design, their, own, costumes, sometimes, with, assistance, from, their, coach, or, choreographer, or, turn, to, professional, designers, costumes, may, cost, thousands, of, dollars, if, designed, by, a, top, level, costume, maker, according, to, current, isu, regulations, costumes, in, competition, must, be, fair, non, revealing, and, appropriate, for, both, short, and, long, programs, costumes, should, not, be, showy, or, exotic, in, nature, clothing, however, can, reflect, the, genre, of, music, chosen, although, the, use, of, flesh, colored, fabric, means, the, costumes, are, often, less, revealing, than, they, may, appear, there, have, been, repeated, attempts, to, ban, clothing, that, gives, the, impression, of, excessive, nudity, or, that, is, otherwise, inappropriate, for, athletic, competition, in, general, accessories, or, props, are, not, permitted, in, competition, the, isu, allowed, an, exception, for, the, original, dance, in, the, 2007, 08, season, but, not, since, to, compete, internationally, on, the, senior, level, skaters, must, be, at, least, 17, before, july, 1, of, the, preceding, year, to, be, eligible, for, junior, level, events, a, skater, must, be, at, least, 13, but, under, 19, before, that, date, or, 21, for, male, pair, skaters, and, ice, dancers, a, skater, must, meet, the, age, requirement, before, it, becomes, july, 1, in, their, place, of, birth, for, example, adelina, sotnikova, was, born, a, few, hours, into, july, 1, 1996, in, moscow, and, consequently, was, not, eligible, to, compete, at, junior, worlds, until, 2011, and, senior, worlds, until, 2013, the, isu, s, rules, apply, to, international, events, many, countries, have, no, age, requirements, for, domestic, non, isu, competitions, thus, some, skaters, compete, at, the, senior, level, nationally, while, not, eligible, for, international, competition, the, isu, has, modified, its, age, rules, several, times, before, the, 1990s, 12, was, the, minimum, age, for, senior, international, competitions, new, rules, were, introduced, in, 1996, requiring, skaters, to, be, at, least, 15, before, july, 1, of, the, preceding, year, to, compete, at, the, olympics, worlds, europeans, or, four, continents, the, minimum, age, for, all, other, senior, internationals, was, 14, until, july, 2014, when, it, was, raised, to, 15, the, age, limit, was, then, raised, to, 16, years, old, for, the, 2023, 24, season, before, increasing, to, 17, for, the, 2024, 25, season, in, a, move, to, raise, the, age, limit, gradually, the, move, came, after, the, 2022, winter, olympics, scandal, over, kamila, valieva, s, doping, allegations, and, the, controversy, over, her, responsibility, as, a, minor, during, the, 2005, 06, season, mao, asada, of, japan, was, age, eligible, to, compete, at, the, grand, prix, final, where, she, claimed, the, title, but, she, was, not, permitted, to, compete, at, the, olympics, for, the, 2008, world, championships, the, united, states, was, obliged, to, send, skaters, who, had, placed, 5th, and, 7th, at, nationals, because, higher, placed, skaters, were, too, young, including, a, skater, who, missed, the, cutoff, by, 20, days, the, isu, has, strictly, enforced, the, rules, in, recent, years, however, american, pair, skater, natasha, kuchiki, was, allowed, to, compete, at, the, 1990, world, championships, when, she, was, two, years, too, young, and, american, single, skater, tara, lipinski, who, was, 13, at, the, time, the, 1996, rules, were, introduced, was, grandfathered, into, remaining, eligible, for, future, events, along, with, other, skaters, who, had, already, competed, at, the, world, championships, a, loophole, also, existed, for, a, few, years, for, underage, skaters, who, had, medaled, at, junior, worlds, as, in, gymnastics, skating, has, experienced, controversy, surrounding, possible, age, falsification, on, february, 14, 2011, questions, emerged, surrounding, nine, chinese, skaters, the, associated, press, found, that, birthdates, listed, on, the, chinese, skating, association, s, website, suggested, five, female, skaters, sui, wenjing, zhang, dan, yu, xiaoyu, geng, bingwa, and, xu, binshu, were, younger, than, their, isu, ages, and, four, male, skaters, han, cong, zhang, hao, jin, yang, and, gao, yu, were, older, the, dates, disappeared, from, the, website, by, february, 15, on, february, 17, the, isu, said, there, were, no, discrepancies, for, zhang, dan, zhang, hao, and, xu, binshu, between, the, birthdates, listed, on, their, passports, isu, registration, forms, and, the, chinese, olympic, committee, s, website, athletes, in, china, sometimes, face, pressure, to, falsify, their, age, skaters, may, represent, a, country, of, which, they, are, not, yet, a, citizen, in, most, competitions, except, the, olympics, which, require, citizenship, at, most, international, events, each, country, may, send, one, to, a, maximum, of, three, entries, per, discipline, consequently, even, if, a, skater, has, a, high, season, s, best, he, or, she, may, not, be, sent, to, major, events, if, their, country, has, many, good, skaters, in, their, discipline, some, skaters, have, tried, to, circumvent, this, by, representing, another, country, in, response, the,

compulsory, figures, and, introduced, the, short, program, in, 1973, a, critical, issue, was, said, to, have, been, the, continued, failure, of, janet, lynn, to, achieve, on, the, world, stage,

by, showing, skaters, in, the, kiss, and, cry, area, after, competing, television, also, played, a, role, in, removing, the, restrictive, amateur, status, rules, that, once, governed, the, sport, in,

athletes, in, other, sports, she, states, that, television, has, encouraged, casual, fans, and, other, members, of, the, general, public, to, understand, skating, in, terms, of, media, shaped, parables, about, broader, cultural, issues, including, anxieties, about, femininity, or, masculinity, individuality, versus, conformity, and, nationalistic, sporting, contests, kestnbaum, also, states, that, even, though, most, skating, broadcasts, are, produced, by, networks, sports, divisions, competitions, even, the, more, serious, ones, they, are, packaged, with, more, emphasis, on, the, aesthetic, qualities, of, the, skating, or, of, the, female, skaters, and, on, the, pleasures, of, rooting, for, a, home, country, hero, than, on, the, technical, details, that, determine, the, winners, viewers, who, depend, upon, the, televised, coverage, of, figure, skating, are, limited, in, their, access, to, information, about, it, as, a, sport, because, broadcasters, present, a, week, s, worth, of, competition, in, a, few, hours, and, they, are, compelled, to, avoid, overloading, viewers, with, too, much, information, about, the, more, technical, aspects, of, the, sport, journalists, and, scholars, who, write, about, figure, skating, also, tend, to, focus, on, the, same, broader, cultural, issues, books, films, and, series, video, games
