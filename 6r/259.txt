preadolescence, is, a, stage, of, human, development, following, middle, childhood, and, preceding, adolescence, it, commonly, ends, with, the, beginning, of, puberty, preadolescence, is, commonly, defined, as, ages, 9, 12, ending, with, the, major, onset, of, puberty, it, may, also, be, defined, as, simply, the, 2, year, period, before, the, major, onset, of, puberty, preadolescence, can, bring, its, own, challenges, and, anxieties, a, term, used, to, refer, to, the, preadolescent, stage, in, everyday, speech, is, tween, and, its, perhaps, older, variants, tweenie, tweeny, tweenager, and, tweener, it, s, a, blend, portmanteau, of, the, words, teen, and, between, in, the, sense, of, between, childhood, and, adolescence, and, refers, to, 9, to, 12, year, olds, sometimes, the, terms, tweenie, and, tweenager, are, used, to, differentiate, between, older, 10, to, 15, and, younger, 7, to, 11, age, groups, respectively, while, known, as, preadolescent, in, psychology, the, terms, preteen, or, tween, are, common, in, everyday, use, a, preteen, or, preteenager, is, a, person, below, 13, years, of, age, generally, the, term, is, restricted, to, those, close, to, reaching, age, 13, especially, ages, 9, to, 12, tween, is, an, american, neologism, and, marketing, term, for, preteen, which, is, a, blend, of, between, and, teen, people, within, this, age, range, are, variously, described, as, tweens, preadolescents, tweenies, preteens, pubescents, middle, schoolers, or, tweenagers, a, junior, high, school, can, sometimes, be, confused, with, a, middle, school, though, serving, a, similar, purpose, in, bridging, a, gap, between, elementary, school, and, high, school, a, junior, high, school, typically, serves, 7th, to, 9th, grade, students, whereas, a, middle, school, serves, 6th, to, 8th, grade, students, therefore, middle, schools, serve, a, slightly, younger, demographic, more, befitting, of, preadolescents, while, junior, high, schools, typically, serve, young, adolescents, being, prepubescent, is, not, the, same, thing, as, being, preadolescent, instead, prepubescent, and, sometimes, child, is, a, term, for, boys, and, girls, who, have, not, developed, secondary, sex, characteristics, while, preadolescent, is, generally, defined, as, those, ranging, from, age, 9, to, 12, years, preadolescence, may, also, be, defined, as, the, period, from, 10, to, 13, years, the, point, at, which, a, child, becomes, an, adolescent, is, defined, by, the, major, onset, of, puberty, however, in, some, individuals, particularly, females, puberty, begins, in, the, preadolescence, years, studies, indicate, that, the, onset, of, puberty, has, been, one, year, earlier, with, each, generation, since, the, 1950s, one, can, also, distinguish, middle, childhood, and, preadolescence, middle, childhood, from, approximately, 5, 8, years, as, opposed, to, the, time, children, are, generally, considered, to, reach, preadolescence, there, is, no, exact, agreement, as, to, when, preadolescence, starts, and, ends, early, puberty, begins, as, the, result, of, the, initiation, of, the, pulsatile, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, gnrh, secretion, by, the, hypothalamus, the, exact, mechanism, of, this, initiation, is, currently, unknown, and, remains, under, investigation, pulsatile, gnrh, secretion, results, in, the, pulsatile, secretions, of, gonadotropins, luteinizing, hormone, lh, and, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, which, act, on, the, gonads, ovaries, in, females, or, testicles, in, males, to, cause, increase, secretion, of, sex, steroids, in, females, the, predominant, sex, steroid, released, is, estrogen, and, in, individuals, with, testicles, the, predominant, sex, steroid, released, is, testosterone, these, sex, hormones, then, lead, to, the, development, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, the, stages, of, puberty, can, be, described, with, the, tanner, scale, also, known, as, the, sexual, maturity, rating, which, incorporates, measurements, and, characteristics, of, primary, and, secondary, sex, characteristics, for, example, genital, and, breast, development, as, well, as, pubic, hair, growth, pubertal, development, is, regulated, by, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, gonadal, hpg, axis, tanner, staging, ranges, from, 1, through, 5, with, 5, being, the, most, developed, with, regards, to, pubic, hair, development, the, scale, goes, as, follows, stage, 1, no, hair, 2, downy, hair, 3, scant, terminal, hair, 4, terminal, hair, overlying, the, pubic, triangle, 5, terminal, hair, extending, to, the, thigh, with, regards, to, male, genitalia, development, the, scale, goes, as, follows, 1, testes, at, the, same, size, and, proportion, of, early, childhood, 2, enlargement, of, the, scrotum, change, in, texture, of, scrotal, skin, 3, growth, of, the, penis, length, wise, 4, growth, of, the, penis, in, terms, of, length, and, circumference, 5, adult, sized, genitalia, with, regards, to, female, breast, development, the, scale, is, as, follows, 1, no, palpable, gland, tissue, 2, palpable, breast, bud, under, areola, 3, breast, tissue, palpable, outside, of, areola, 4, areola, elevated, above, breast, contour, 5, areolar, mound, recedes, into, single, breast, contour, the, average, age, in, which, both, males, and, females, reach, tanner, stage, 5, of, pubertal, development, is, around, 15, 16, there, are, significant, neurological, changes, that, are, expressed, during, preadolescence, white, matter, refers, to, the, region, of, the, nervous, system, corresponding, to, neuronal, axons, which, form, fibers, that, convey, information, across, different, regions, of, the, brain, in, contrast, grey, matter, refers, to, the, region, of, the, nervous, system, corresponding, to, neuronal, cell, bodies, which, process, and, relay, neuronal, signals, white, matter, volume, increases, at, a, relatively, linear, rate, of, about, 12, from, ages, 4, through, 22, specifically, focused, in, the, frontal, parietal, and, occipital, lobes, increases, in, white, matter, volume, may, be, correlated, to, improvements, of, fine, motor, performance, auditory, processing, as, well, as, sensory, information, transfer, between, language, areas, of, the, brain, in, contrast, cortical, gray, matter, increases, in, early, life, peaks, in, preadolescence, and, declines, through, adulthood, with, the, exception, of, occipital, lobe, gray, matter, for, example, parietal, lobe, gray, matter, peaks, at, age, 10, in, girls, and, 12, in, boys, while, frontal, lobe, gray, matter, peaks, at, age, 11, in, girls, and, 12, in, boys, such, changes, might, reflect, overproduction, of, synapses, in, the, preadolescent, years, in, subsequent, years, there, seems, to, be, pruning, dependent, on, environmental, context, corresponding, to, increased, synchronicity, of, neuron, firing, a, key, caveat, from, these, imaging, studies, however, is, that, there, exists, significant, variability, in, the, timing, and, characteristics, of, neurological, change, in, preadolescents, neurological, changes, particularly, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, appear, to, be, highly, dependent, on, environmental, input, toxins, hormones, and, lifestyle, factors, including, stress, and, nutrition, impact, neurological, maturation, demonstrating, the, importance, of, early, lifestyle, health, interventions, in, preadolescence, with, regards, to, neurological, and, psychological, development, of, the, two, major, socializing, agents, in, children, s, lives, the, family, environment, and, formal, educational, institutions, it, is, the, family, in, its, function, a, primary, socializer, of, the, child, that, predominates, in, the, first, five, years, of, life, middle, childhood, by, contrast, is, characterized, by, a, child, s, readiness, for, school, being, self, assured, and, interested, knowing, what, kind, of, behavior, is, expected, being, able, to, wait, to, follow, directions, and, getting, along, with, other, children, preadolescent, children, have, a, different, view, of, the, world, from, younger, children, in, many, significant, ways, typically, theirs, is, a, more, realistic, view, of, life, than, the, intense, fantasy, oriented, world, of, earliest, childhood, preadolescents, have, more, mature, sensible, realistic, thoughts, and, actions, the, most, sensible, stage, of, development, the, child, is, a, much, less, emotional, being, now, they, will, often, have, developed, a, sense, of, intentionality, the, wish, and, capacity, to, have, an, impact, and, to, act, upon, that, with, persistence, and, will, have, a, more, developed, sense, of, looking, into, the, future, and, seeing, effects, of, their, actions, as, opposed, to, early, childhood, where, children, often, do, not, worry, about, their, future, this, can, include, more, realistic, job, expectations, i, want, to, be, an, engineer, when, i, grow, up, as, opposed, to, i, want, to, be, a, wizard, middle, children, generally, show, more, investment, in, control, over, external, reality, through, the, acquisition, of, knowledge, and, competence, where, they, do, have, worries, these, may, be, more, a, fear, of, kidnappings, rapes, and, scary, media, events, as, opposed, to, fantasy, things, e, g, witches, monsters, ghosts, preadolescents, may, well, view, human, relationships, differently, e, g, they, may, notice, the, flawed, human, side, of, authority, figures, alongside, that, they, may, begin, to, develop, a, sense, of, self, identity, and, to, have, increased, feelings, of, independence, may, feel, an, individual, no, longer, just, one, of, the, family, a, different, view, on, morality, can, emerge, and, the, middle, child, will, also, show, more, cooperativeness, the, ability, to, balance, one, s, own, needs, with, those, of, others, in, group, activities, many, preadolescents, will, often, start, to, question, their, home, life, and, surroundings, around, this, time, and, they, may, also, start, to, form, opinions, that, may, differ, from, their, upbringing, in, regards, to, issues, such, as, politics, religion, sexuality, and, gender, roles, they, may, choose, their, own, activities, though, they, are, still, susceptible, to, pressure, from, others, around, them, many, preadolescents, play, organized, sports, but, necessary, free, play, self, directed, freely, chosen, independent, play, may, get, overlooked, early, sports, specialization, choosing, a, single, sport, to, play, intensively, or, year, round, before, puberty, has, a, high, risk, of, injuries, youth, sports, organizations, recommend, a, minimum, of, five, hours, of, free, play, per, week, for, preadolescent, athletes, greater, responsibility, within, the, family, can, also, appear, as, middle, children, become, responsible, for, younger, siblings, and, relatives, as, with, babysitting, while, preadolescents, may, start, caring, about, what, they, look, like, and, what, they, are, wearing, prior, to, adolescence, children, may, have, a, dependence, on, their, family, as, their, main, agent, of, socialization, this, helps, the, child, establish, their, attitudes, viewpoints, social, norms, and, societal, roles, among, these, changes, is, the, shift, from, elementary, to, middle, or, junior, high, school, in, this, unfamiliar, environment, the, child, may, find, the, pressure, to, rapidly, adapt, and, fit, in, children, start, to, spend, less, time, with, family, and, more, time, with, friends, at, this, time, socialization, by, the, school, and, peer, environment, can, become, more, predominant, as, the, preadolescent, starts, to, learn, more, about, how, they, would, wish, to, hold, themselves, during, interpersonal, relationships, while, children, find, this, need, to, fit, in, preadolescents, have, a, conflicting, desire, to, establish, their, own, individualism, as, the, child, grows, into, the, transitionary, period, of, preadolescence, the, child, often, starts, to, develop, a, sense, of, autonomy, as, the, child, is, exposed, to, a, larger, world, around, them, full, of, sudden, and, unfamiliar, changes, compounded, with, a, sense, of, self, consciousness, the, preadolescent, starts, to, explore, their, own, self, identity, and, their, role, in, society, further, during, preadolescence, early, adolescence, individuals, may, become, more, preoccupied, with, body, image, and, privacy, corresponding, to, physical, changes, seen, during, adrenarche, and, puberty, early, adolescents, may, become, aware, of, their, sexuality, for, the, first, time, and, experience, attraction, towards, others, homosexual, and, heterosexual, experimentation, is, not, uncommon, although, it, is, important, to, note, that, many, teens, who, eventually, identify, as, lgbt, do, not, always, do, so, during, adolescence, on, average, gay, lesbian, and, bisexual, individuals, report, experiencing, same, sex, attraction, in, early, adolescence, at, age, 12, about, 4, in, 10, gay, men, and, 2, in, 10, lesbian, women, report, experiencing, same, sex, attraction, before, age, 10, for, individuals, who, begin, to, experience, same, sex, attraction, familial, support, and, acceptance, consistently, predicts, positive, outcomes, parents, and, guardians, can, support, preadolescents, regardless, of, sexual, orientation, by, having, honest, conversations, about, sex, specifically, parents, can, talk, and, listen, in, a, way, that, invites, preadolescents, to, have, an, open, discussion, about, sexual, orientation, where, development, has, been, optimal, preadolescents, come, to, school, for, something, to, be, added, to, their, lives, they, want, to, learn, lessons, which, can, lead, to, their, eventually, working, in, a, job, like, their, parents, when, earlier, developmental, stages, have, gone, astray, however, then, on, the, principle, that, if, you, miss, a, stage, you, can, always, go, through, it, later, some, middle, children, come, to, school, for, another, purpose, to, learn, but, to, find, a, home, from, home, a, stable, emotional, situation, in, which, they, can, exercise, their, own, emotional, liability, a, group, of, which, they, can, gradually, become, a, part, children, at, the, threshold, of, adolescence, in, the, nine, to, twelve, year, old, group, would, seem, to, have, particular, vulnerabilities, to, parental, separation, among, such, problems, were, the, very, eagerness, of, these, youngsters, to, be, co, opted, into, the, parental, battling, their, willingness, to, take, sides, and, the, intense, compassionate, caretaking, relations, which, led, these, youngsters, to, attempt, to, rescue, a, distressed, parent, often, to, their, own, detriment, preadolescents, may, well, be, more, exposed, to, popular, culture, than, younger, children, and, have, interests, based, on, internet, trends, television, shows, and, movies, no, longer, just, cartoons, fashion, technology, music, and, social, media, preadolescents, generally, prefer, certain, brands, and, are, a, heavily, targeted, market, of, many, advertisers, their, tendency, to, buy, brand, name, items, may, be, due, to, a, desire, to, fit, in, although, the, desire, is, not, as, strong, as, it, is, with, teenagers, some, scholars, suggest, that, pre, adolescents, reported, frequent, encounters, with, sexual, material, in, the, media, valued, the, information, received, from, it, and, used, it, as, a, learning, resource, and, evaluated, such, content, through, what, they, perceived, to, be, sexual, morality, however, other, research, has, suggested, that, sexual, media, influences, on, preadolescent, and, adolescent, sexual, behavior, is, minimal, freud, called, this, stage, the, latency, period, to, indicate, that, sexual, feelings, and, interest, went, underground, erik, h, erikson, noted, that, latency, period, children, in, middle, childhood, can, then, direct, more, of, their, energy, into, asexual, pursuits, such, as, school, athletics, and, same, sex, friendships, nevertheless, recent, research, contradicts, these, notions, suggesting, that, sexual, development, interest, and, behavior, among, latent, period, children, does, not, cease, instead, the, apparent, lack, of, sexual, interest, is, due, to, children, not, sharing, their, sexual, interests, emotions, with, adults
