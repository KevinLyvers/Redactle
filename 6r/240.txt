incest, n, s, s, t, in, sest, is, human, sexual, activity, between, family, members, or, close, relatives, this, typically, includes, sexual, activity, between, people, in, consanguinity, blood, relations, and, sometimes, those, related, by, lineage, it, is, condemned, and, considered, immoral, in, most, societies, given, that, it, can, lead, to, an, increased, risk, of, genetic, disorders, in, children, in, case, of, pregnancy, from, incestuous, intercourse, the, incest, taboo, is, one, of, the, most, widespread, of, all, cultural, taboos, both, in, present, and, in, past, societies, most, modern, societies, have, laws, regarding, incest, or, social, restrictions, on, closely, consanguineous, marriages, in, societies, where, it, is, illegal, consensual, adult, incest, is, seen, by, some, as, a, victimless, crime, some, cultures, extend, the, incest, taboo, to, relatives, with, no, consanguinity, such, as, milk, siblings, stepsiblings, and, adoptive, siblings, albeit, sometimes, with, less, intensity, third, degree, relatives, such, as, half, aunt, half, nephew, first, cousin, on, average, have, 12, 5, common, genetic, heritage, and, sexual, relations, between, them, are, viewed, differently, in, various, cultures, from, being, discouraged, to, being, socially, acceptable, children, of, incestuous, relationships, have, been, regarded, as, illegitimate, and, are, still, so, regarded, in, some, societies, today, in, most, cases, the, parents, did, not, have, the, option, to, marry, to, remove, that, status, as, incestuous, marriages, were, and, are, normally, also, prohibited, a, common, justification, for, prohibiting, incest, is, avoiding, inbreeding, a, collection, of, genetic, disorders, suffered, by, the, children, of, parents, with, a, close, genetic, relationship, such, children, are, at, greater, risk, of, congenital, disorders, developmental, and, physical, disability, and, death, that, risk, is, proportional, to, their, parents, coefficient, of, relationship, a, measure, of, how, closely, the, parents, are, related, genetically, however, cultural, anthropologists, have, noted, that, inbreeding, avoidance, cannot, form, the, sole, basis, for, the, incest, taboo, because, the, boundaries, of, the, incest, prohibition, vary, widely, between, cultures, and, not, necessarily, in, ways, that, maximize, the, avoidance, of, inbreeding, in, some, societies, such, as, those, of, ancient, egypt, brother, sister, father, daughter, mother, son, cousin, cousin, aunt, nephew, uncle, niece, and, other, combinations, of, relations, within, a, royal, family, were, married, as, a, means, of, perpetuating, the, royal, lineage, some, societies, have, different, views, about, what, constitutes, illegal, or, immoral, incest, for, example, in, samoa, a, man, was, permitted, to, marry, his, older, sister, but, not, his, younger, sister, however, sexual, relations, with, a, first, degree, relative, meaning, a, parent, sibling, or, child, are, almost, universally, forbidden, the, english, word, incest, is, derived, from, the, latin, incestus, which, has, a, general, meaning, of, impure, unchaste, it, was, introduced, into, middle, english, both, in, the, generic, latin, sense, preserved, throughout, the, middle, english, period, and, in, the, narrow, modern, sense, the, derived, adjective, incestuous, appears, in, the, 16th, century, before, the, latin, term, came, in, incest, was, known, in, old, english, as, sib, leger, from, sibb, kinship, leger, to, lie, or, m, h, med, from, m, kin, parent, h, med, sexual, intercourse, but, in, time, both, words, fell, out, of, use, terms, like, incester, and, incestual, have, been, used, to, describe, those, interested, or, involved, in, sexual, relations, with, relatives, among, humans, while, inbreeder, has, been, used, in, relation, to, similar, behavior, among, non, human, organisms, in, ancient, china, first, cousins, with, the, same, surnames, i, e, those, born, to, the, father, s, brothers, were, not, permitted, to, marry, while, those, with, different, surnames, could, marry, i, e, maternal, cousins, and, paternal, cousins, born, to, the, father, s, sisters, in, achaemenid, persia, marriages, between, family, members, such, as, half, siblings, nieces, and, cousins, took, place, but, were, not, seen, as, incestuous, however, greek, sources, state, that, brother, sister, and, father, daughter, marriages, allegedly, took, place, inside, the, royal, family, yet, it, remains, problematic, to, determine, the, reliability, of, these, accounts, according, to, herodotus, shah, cambyses, ii, supposedly, married, two, of, his, sisters, atossa, and, roxane, this, would, have, been, regarded, as, illegal, however, herodotus, also, states, that, cambyses, married, otanes, daughter, phaidyme, whilst, his, contemporary, ctesias, names, roxane, as, cambyses, wife, but, she, is, not, referred, to, as, his, sister, the, accusations, against, cambyses, of, committing, incest, are, mentioned, as, part, of, his, blasphemous, actions, which, were, designed, to, illustrate, his, madness, and, vanity, these, reports, all, derive, from, the, same, egyptian, source, that, was, antagonistic, towards, cambyses, and, some, of, these, allegations, of, crimes, such, as, the, killing, of, the, apis, bull, have, been, confirmed, as, false, which, means, that, the, report, of, cambyses, supposed, incestuous, acts, is, questionable, several, of, the, egyptian, kings, married, their, sisters, and, had, several, children, with, them, to, continue, the, royal, bloodline, for, example, tutankhamun, married, his, half, sister, ankhesenamun, and, was, himself, the, child, of, an, incestuous, union, between, akhenaten, and, an, unidentified, sister, wife, several, scholars, such, as, frier, et, al, state, that, sibling, marriages, were, widespread, among, all, classes, in, egypt, during, the, graeco, roman, period, numerous, papyri, and, the, roman, census, declarations, attest, to, many, husbands, and, wives, being, brother, and, sister, of, the, same, father, and, mother, however, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, available, evidence, does, not, support, the, view, that, such, relations, were, common, the, most, famous, of, these, relationships, were, in, the, ptolemaic, royal, family, cleopatra, vii, was, married, to, two, of, her, younger, brothers, ptolemy, xiii, and, ptolemy, xiv, whilst, her, mother, and, father, cleopatra, v, and, ptolemy, xii, were, also, brother, and, sister, arsinoe, ii, and, her, younger, brother, ptolemy, ii, philadelphus, were, the, first, in, the, family, to, participate, in, a, full, sibling, marriage, a, departure, from, custom, a, union, between, full, siblings, was, counternormative, in, greek, and, macedonian, tradition, and, prohibited, by, the, laws, of, at, least, some, cities, the, fable, of, oedipus, with, a, theme, of, inadvertent, incest, between, a, mother, and, son, ends, in, disaster, and, shows, ancient, taboos, against, incest, since, oedipus, blinds, himself, in, disgust, and, shame, after, his, incestuous, actions, in, the, sequel, to, oedipus, antigone, his, four, children, are, also, punished, for, their, parents, incestuousness, incest, appears, in, the, commonly, accepted, version, of, the, birth, of, adonis, when, his, mother, myrrha, has, sex, with, her, father, cinyras, during, a, festival, disguised, as, a, prostitute, in, ancient, greece, spartan, king, leonidas, i, hero, of, the, legendary, battle, of, thermopylae, was, married, to, his, niece, gorgo, daughter, of, his, half, brother, cleomenes, i, greek, law, allowed, marriage, between, a, brother, and, sister, if, they, had, different, mothers, for, example, some, accounts, say, that, elpinice, was, for, a, time, married, to, her, half, brother, cimon, incest, is, mentioned, and, condemned, in, virgil, s, aeneid, book, vi, hic, thalamum, invasit, natae, vetitosque, hymenaeos, this, one, invaded, a, daughter, s, room, and, a, forbidden, sex, act, roman, civil, law, prohibited, marriages, within, four, degrees, of, consanguinity, but, had, no, degrees, of, affinity, with, regard, to, marriage, roman, civil, laws, prohibited, any, marriage, between, parents, and, children, either, in, the, ascending, or, descending, line, ad, infinitum, adoption, was, considered, the, same, as, affinity, in, that, an, adoptive, father, could, not, marry, an, unemancipated, daughter, or, granddaughter, even, if, the, adoption, had, been, dissolved, incestuous, unions, were, discouraged, and, considered, nefas, against, the, laws, of, gods, and, man, in, ancient, rome, in, ad, 295, incest, was, explicitly, forbidden, by, an, imperial, edict, which, divided, the, concept, of, incestus, into, two, categories, of, unequal, gravity, the, incestus, iuris, gentium, which, was, applied, to, both, romans, and, non, romans, in, the, empire, and, the, incestus, iuris, civilis, which, concerned, only, roman, citizens, therefore, for, example, an, egyptian, could, marry, an, aunt, but, a, roman, could, not, despite, the, act, of, incest, being, unacceptable, within, the, roman, empire, roman, emperor, caligula, is, rumored, to, have, had, sexual, relationships, with, all, three, of, his, sisters, julia, livilla, drusilla, and, agrippina, the, younger, emperor, claudius, after, executing, his, previous, wife, married, his, brother, s, daughter, agrippina, the, younger, and, changed, the, law, to, allow, an, otherwise, illegal, union, the, law, prohibiting, marrying, a, sister, s, daughter, remained, the, taboo, against, incest, in, ancient, rome, is, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, politicians, would, use, charges, of, incest, often, false, charges, as, insults, and, means, of, political, disenfranchisement, in, norse, mythology, there, are, themes, of, brother, sister, marriage, a, prominent, example, being, between, nj, r, r, and, his, unnamed, sister, perhaps, nerthus, parents, of, freyja, and, freyr, loki, in, turn, also, accuses, freyja, and, freyr, of, having, a, sexual, relationship, the, earliest, biblical, reference, to, possible, incest, involves, cain, it, was, cited, that, he, knew, his, wife, and, she, conceived, and, bore, enoch, a, literalist, reading, of, this, passage, indicates, that, during, this, period, there, was, no, other, woman, except, eve, or, there, was, an, unnamed, sister, in, which, case, cain, had, an, incestuous, relationship, with, his, mother, or, his, sister, according, to, the, book, of, jubilees, cain, married, his, sister, awan, later, in, genesis, 20, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, patriarch, abraham, married, his, half, sister, sarah, other, references, include, the, passage, in, 2, samuel, 13, where, amnon, king, david, s, son, rapes, his, half, sister, tamar, according, to, michael, d, coogan, it, would, have, been, perfectly, all, right, for, amnon, to, have, married, her, the, bible, being, inconsistent, about, prohibiting, incest, in, genesis, 19, 30, 38, while, living, in, an, isolated, area, after, the, destruction, of, sodom, and, gomorrah, lot, s, two, daughters, conspire, to, inebriate, and, rape, their, father, due, to, the, lack, of, available, partners, to, continue, his, line, of, descent, because, of, intoxication, lot, perceived, not, when, his, firstborn, and, the, following, night, his, younger, daughter, lay, with, him, moses, was, also, born, of, an, incestuous, marriage, exodus, 6, details, how, his, father, amram, was, the, nephew, of, his, mother, jochebed, an, account, noted, that, the, incestuous, relations, did, not, suffer, the, fate, of, childlessness, which, was, the, punishment, for, such, couples, in, levitical, law, it, stated, however, that, the, incest, exposed, moses, to, the, peril, of, wild, beasts, of, the, weather, of, the, water, and, more, many, european, monarchs, were, related, due, to, political, marriages, such, that, many, such, marriages, were, between, cousins, of, some, degree, uncles, and, nieces, and, so, forth, and, sometimes, first, cousins, this, was, especially, true, in, the, habsburg, hohenzollern, savoy, and, bourbon, royal, houses, however, relations, between, siblings, which, may, have, been, tolerated, in, other, cultures, were, considered, abhorrent, for, example, the, false, accusation, that, anne, boleyn, and, her, brother, george, boleyn, had, committed, incest, was, one, of, the, reasons, given, for, both, being, executed, in, may, 1536, historians, agree, that, the, false, accusation, against, anne, boleyn, and, george, boleyn, was, trumped, up, in, order, to, ensure, the, king, could, go, on, to, marry, jane, seymour, sects, deemed, heretical, such, as, the, waldensians, were, accused, of, incest, incestuous, marriages, were, also, seen, in, the, royal, houses, of, ancient, japan, and, korea, inca, peru, ancient, hawaii, and, at, times, central, africa, mexico, and, thailand, like, the, kings, of, ancient, egypt, the, inca, rulers, married, their, sisters, huayna, capac, for, instance, was, the, son, of, topa, inca, yupanqui, and, the, inca, s, sister, and, wife, half, sibling, marriages, were, found, in, ancient, japan, such, as, the, marriage, of, emperor, bidatsu, and, his, half, sister, empress, suiko, japanese, prince, kinashi, no, karu, had, sexual, relations, with, his, full, sister, princess, karu, no, iratsume, although, the, action, was, regarded, as, foolish, in, order, to, prevent, the, influence, of, the, other, families, korean, goryeo, dynasty, monarch, gwangjong, married, his, half, sister, daemok, in, the, 10th, century, marriage, with, a, family, member, not, related, by, blood, was, also, regarded, as, contravening, morality, and, was, therefore, incest, one, example, of, this, is, the, 14th, century, chunghye, of, goryeo, who, raped, one, of, his, deceased, father, s, concubines, who, was, thus, regarded, to, be, his, mother, in, india, the, largest, proportion, of, women, aged, 13, to, 49, who, marry, their, close, relatives, are, in, tamil, nadu, then, andhra, pradesh, karnataka, and, maharashtra, while, it, is, rare, for, uncle, niece, marriages, it, is, more, common, in, andhra, pradesh, and, tamil, nadu, in, some, southeast, asian, cultures, stories, of, incest, being, common, among, certain, ethnicities, are, sometimes, told, as, expressions, of, contempt, for, those, ethnicities, marriages, between, younger, brothers, and, their, older, sisters, were, common, among, the, early, udege, people, incest, between, an, adult, and, a, person, under, the, age, of, consent, is, considered, a, form, of, child, sexual, abuse, that, has, been, shown, to, be, one, of, the, most, extreme, forms, of, childhood, abuse, it, often, results, in, serious, and, long, term, psychological, trauma, especially, in, the, case, of, parental, incest, its, prevalence, is, difficult, to, generalize, but, research, has, estimated, 10, 15, of, the, general, population, as, having, had, at, least, one, such, sexual, contact, with, less, than, 2, involving, intercourse, or, attempted, intercourse, among, women, research, has, yielded, estimates, as, high, as, 20, father, daughter, incest, was, for, many, years, the, most, commonly, reported, and, studied, form, of, incest, mother, son, incest, is, rarely, reported, according, to, catanzarite, 1980, between, 1965, and, 1980, only, a, handful, such, cases, were, documented, catanzarite, attributes, this, to, selection, bias, and, the, lack, of, physical, evidence, in, such, cases, according, to, etherington, 1997, one, of, the, reasons, of, the, under, reporting, of, such, cases, is, that, men, often, found, difficulty, in, defining, their, mother, s, behavior, as, abuse, in, a, clinical, study, by, olson, 1990, 30, men, had, been, victims, of, incest, the, mother, was, a, perpetrator, in, 61, 5, of, cases, in, a, clinical, study, by, kelly, et, al, 2002, among, the, 67, sexually, abused, men, in, 17, cases, the, perpetrators, were, their, mothers, more, recently, studies, have, suggested, that, sibling, incest, particularly, older, brothers, having, sexual, relations, with, younger, siblings, is, the, most, common, form, of, incest, with, some, studies, finding, sibling, incest, occurring, more, frequently, than, other, forms, of, incest, some, studies, suggest, that, adolescent, perpetrators, of, sibling, abuse, choose, younger, victims, abuse, victims, over, a, lengthier, period, use, violence, more, frequently, and, severely, than, adult, perpetrators, and, that, sibling, abuse, has, a, higher, rate, of, penetrative, acts, than, father, or, stepfather, incest, with, father, and, older, brother, incest, resulting, in, greater, reported, distress, than, stepfather, incest, south, africa, saudi, arabia, sudan, pakistan, and, nigeria, are, some, of, the, countries, with, the, most, incest, through, consanguineous, marriage, sex, between, an, adult, family, member, and, a, child, is, usually, considered, a, form, of, child, sexual, abuse, also, known, as, child, incestuous, abuse, and, for, many, years, has, been, the, most, reported, form, of, incest, father, daughter, and, stepfather, stepdaughter, sex, are, the, most, commonly, reported, forms, of, adult, child, incest, with, most, of, the, remaining, involving, a, mother, or, stepmother, many, studies, found, that, stepfathers, tend, to, be, far, more, likely, than, biological, fathers, to, engage, in, this, form, of, incest, one, study, of, adult, women, in, san, francisco, estimated, that, 17, of, women, were, abused, by, stepfathers, and, 2, were, abused, by, biological, fathers, father, son, incest, is, reported, less, often, but, it, is, not, known, how, close, the, frequency, is, to, heterosexual, incest, because, it, is, likely, more, under, reported, the, prevalence, of, incest, between, parents, and, their, children, is, difficult, to, estimate, due, to, secrecy, and, privacy, in, a, 1999, news, story, the, bbc, reported, close, knit, family, life, in, india, masks, an, alarming, amount, of, sexual, abuse, of, children, and, teenage, girls, by, family, members, a, new, report, suggests, delhi, organisation, rahi, said, 76, of, respondents, to, its, survey, had, been, abused, when, they, were, children, 40, of, those, by, a, family, member, according, to, the, national, center, for, victims, of, crime, a, large, proportion, of, rape, committed, in, the, united, states, is, perpetrated, by, a, family, member, research, indicates, that, 46, of, children, who, are, raped, are, victims, of, family, members, langan, and, harlow, 1994, the, majority, of, american, rape, victims, 61, are, raped, before, the, age, of, 18, furthermore, 29, of, all, rapes, occurred, when, the, victim, was, less, than, 11, years, old, 11, of, rape, victims, are, raped, by, their, fathers, or, stepfathers, and, another, 16, are, raped, by, other, relatives, a, study, of, victims, of, father, daughter, incest, in, the, 1970s, showed, that, there, were, common, features, within, families, before, the, occurrence, of, incest, estrangement, between, the, mother, and, the, daughter, extreme, paternal, dominance, and, reassignment, of, some, of, the, mother, s, traditional, major, family, responsibility, to, the, daughter, oldest, and, only, daughters, were, more, likely, to, be, the, victims, of, incest, it, was, also, stated, that, the, incest, experience, was, psychologically, harmful, to, the, woman, in, later, life, frequently, leading, to, low, self, esteem, very, unhealthy, sexual, activity, contempt, for, other, women, and, other, emotional, problems, adults, who, as, children, were, incestuously, victimized, by, adults, often, suffer, from, low, self, esteem, difficulties, in, interpersonal, relationships, and, sexual, dysfunction, and, are, at, an, extremely, high, risk, of, many, mental, disorders, including, depression, anxiety, disorders, phobic, avoidance, reactions, somatoform, disorder, substance, abuse, borderline, personality, disorder, and, complex, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, the, goler, clan, in, nova, scotia, is, a, specific, instance, in, which, child, sexual, abuse, in, the, form, of, forced, adult, child, and, sibling, sibling, incest, took, place, over, at, least, three, generations, a, number, of, goler, children, were, victims, of, sexual, abuse, at, the, hands, of, fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers, cousins, and, each, other, during, interrogation, by, police, several, of, the, adults, openly, admitted, to, engaging, in, many, forms, of, sexual, activity, up, to, and, including, full, intercourse, multiple, times, with, the, children, sixteen, adults, both, men, and, women, were, charged, with, hundreds, of, allegations, of, incest, and, sexual, abuse, of, children, as, young, as, five, in, july, 2012, twelve, children, were, removed, from, the, colt, family, a, pseudonym, in, new, south, wales, australia, after, the, discovery, of, four, generations, of, incest, child, protection, workers, and, psychologists, said, interviews, with, the, children, indicated, a, virtual, sexual, free, for, all, in, japan, there, is, a, popular, misconception, that, mother, son, incestuous, contact, is, common, due, to, the, manner, in, which, it, is, depicted, in, the, press, and, popular, media, according, to, hideo, tokuoka, when, americans, think, of, incest, they, think, of, fathers, and, daughters, in, japan, one, thinks, of, mothers, and, sons, due, to, the, extensive, media, coverage, of, mother, son, incest, there, some, western, researchers, assumed, that, mother, son, incest, is, common, in, japan, but, research, into, victimization, statistics, from, police, and, health, care, systems, discredits, this, it, shows, that, the, vast, majority, of, sexual, abuse, in, japan, including, incest, is, perpetrated, by, men, against, young, girls, while, incest, between, adults, and, children, generally, involves, the, adult, as, the, perpetrator, of, abuse, there, are, rare, instances, of, sons, sexually, assaulting, their, mothers, these, sons, are, typically, mid, adolescent, to, young, adult, and, unlike, parent, initiated, incest, the, incidents, involve, some, kind, of, physical, force, although, the, mothers, may, be, accused, of, being, seductive, with, their, sons, and, inviting, the, sexual, contact, this, is, contrary, to, evidence, such, accusations, can, parallel, other, forms, of, rape, where, due, to, victim, blaming, a, woman, is, accused, of, being, at, fault, for, the, rape, in, some, cases, mother, son, incest, is, best, classified, as, acquaintance, rape, of, the, mother, by, the, adolescent, son, childhood, sibling, sibling, incest, is, considered, to, be, widespread, but, rarely, reported, sibling, sibling, incest, becomes, child, on, child, sexual, abuse, when, it, occurs, without, consent, without, equality, or, as, a, result, of, coercion, in, this, form, it, is, believed, to, be, the, most, common, form, of, intrafamilial, abuse, the, most, commonly, reported, form, of, abusive, sibling, incest, is, abuse, of, a, younger, sibling, by, an, older, sibling, a, 2006, study, showed, a, large, portion, of, adults, who, experienced, sibling, incest, abuse, have, distorted, or, disturbed, beliefs, such, as, that, the, act, was, normal, both, about, their, own, experience, and, the, subject, of, sexual, abuse, in, general, sibling, abusive, incest, is, most, prevalent, in, families, where, one, or, both, parents, are, often, absent, or, emotionally, unavailable, with, the, abusive, siblings, using, incest, as, a, way, to, assert, their, power, over, a, weaker, sibling, absence, of, the, father, in, particular, has, been, found, to, be, a, significant, element, of, most, cases, of, sexual, abuse, of, female, children, by, a, brother, the, damaging, effects, on, both, childhood, development, and, adult, symptoms, resulting, from, brother, sister, sexual, abuse, are, similar, to, the, effects, of, father, daughter, including, substance, abuse, depression, suicidality, and, eating, disorders, proponents, of, incest, between, consenting, adults, draw, clear, boundaries, between, the, behavior, of, consenting, adults, on, one, hand, and, rape, child, molestation, and, abusive, incest, on, the, other, however, even, consensual, relationships, such, as, these, are, still, legally, classified, as, incest, and, criminalized, in, many, jurisdictions, although, there, are, certain, exceptions, james, roffee, a, senior, lecturer, in, criminology, at, monash, university, and, former, worker, on, legal, responses, to, familial, sexual, activity, in, england, and, wales, and, scotland, discussed, how, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, deems, all, familial, sexual, acts, to, be, criminal, even, if, all, parties, give, their, full, consent, and, are, knowledgeable, to, all, possible, consequences, he, also, argues, that, the, use, of, particular, language, tools, in, the, legislation, manipulates, the, reader, to, deem, all, familial, sexual, activities, as, immoral, and, criminal, even, if, all, parties, are, consenting, adults, in, slate, william, saletan, drew, a, legal, connection, between, gay, sex, and, incest, between, consenting, adults, as, he, described, in, his, article, in, 2003, us, senator, rick, santorum, commented, on, a, pending, us, supreme, court, case, involving, sodomy, laws, primarily, as, a, matter, of, constitutional, rights, to, privacy, and, equal, protection, under, the, law, if, the, supreme, court, says, that, you, have, the, right, to, consensual, sex, within, your, home, then, you, have, the, right, to, bigamy, you, have, the, right, to, polygamy, you, have, the, right, to, incest, you, have, the, right, to, adultery, saletan, argued, that, legally, and, morally, there, is, essentially, no, difference, between, the, two, and, went, on, to, support, incest, between,

is, wrong, because, it, introduces, the, possibility, of, irreparably, damaging, family, units, by, introducing, a, notoriously, incendiary, dynamic, sexual, tension, into, the, mix, in, the, netherlands, marrying, one, s, nephew, or, niece, is, legal, but, only, with, the, explicit, permission, of, the, dutch, government, due, to, the, possible, risk, of, genetic, defects, among, the,

wanted, a, ban, on, marriages, to, nephews, and, nieces, consensual, sex, between, individuals, aged, 16, and, older, is, always, lawful, in, the, netherlands, and, belgium, even, among, closely, related, family, members, sexual, acts, between, an, adult, family, member, and, a, minor, are, illegal, though, they, are, classified, not, as, incest, but, as, abuse, of, the, authority, such, an, adult, has, over, a, minor, comparable, to, that, of, a, teacher, coach, or, priest, in, florida, consensual, adult, sexual, intercourse, with, someone, known, to, be, one, s, aunt, uncle, niece, or,

state, by, state, in, the, united, kingdom, incest, includes, only, sexual, intercourse, with, a, parent, grandparent, child, or, sibling, but, the, more, recently, introduced, offense, of, sex, with, an, adult, relative, extends, as, far, as, half, siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews, and, nieces, however, the, term, incest, remains, widely, used, in, popular, culture, to, describe, any, form, of, sexual, activity, with, a, relative, in, canada, marriage, between, uncles, and, nieces, and, between, aunts, and, nephews, is, legal, one, of, the, most, public, cases, of, adult, sibling, incest, in, the, 2000s, is, the, case, of, patrick, st, bing, and, susan, karolewski, a, brother, sister, couple, from, germany, because, of, violent, behavior, on, the, part, of, his, father, patrick, was, taken, in, at, the, age, of, 3, by, foster, parents, who, adopted, him, later, at, the, age, of, 23, he, learned, about, his, biological, parents, contacted, his, mother, and, met, her, and, his, then, 16, year, old, sister, susan, for, the, first, time, the, now, adult, patrick, moved, in, with, his, birth, family, shortly, thereafter, after, their, mother, died, suddenly, six, months, later, the, siblings, became, intimately, close, and, had, their, first, child, together, in, 2001, by, 2004, they, had, had, four, children, together, eric, sarah, nancy, and, sofia, the, public, nature, of, their, relationship, and, the, repeated, prosecutions, and, jail, time, they, have, served, as, a, result, have, caused, some, in, germany, to, question, whether, incest, between, consenting,

violated, his, right, to, a, private, and, family, life, on, 24, september, 2014, the, german, ethics, council, recommended, that, the, government, abolish, laws, criminalizing, incest, between, siblings, arguing, that, such, bans, impinge, upon, citizens, some, societies, differentiate, between, full, sibling, and, half, sibling, relations, marriages, and, sexual, relationships, between, first, cousins, are, stigmatized, as, incest, in, some, cultures, but, tolerated, in, much, of, the, world, currently, 24, us, states, prohibit, marriages, between, first, cousins, and, another,

as, the, dhond, and, the, bhittani, of, pakistan, clearly, prefer, marriages, between, cousins, due, to, the, belief, they, ensure, purity, of, the, descent, line, provide, intimate, knowledge, of, the, spouses, and, ensure, that, patrimony, will, not, pass, into, the, hands, of, outsiders, cross, cousin, marriages, are, preferred, among, the, yanomami, of, brazilian, amazonia, among, many, other, tribal, societies, identified, by, anthropologists, there, are, some, cultures, in, asia, which, stigmatize, cousin, marriage, in, some, instances, even, marriages, between, second, cousins, or, more, remotely, related, people, this, is, notably, true, in, the, culture, of, korea, in, south, korea, before, 1997, two, people, with, the, same, last, name, and, clan, were, prohibited, from, marrying, in, light, of, this, law, being, held, unconstitutional, south, korea, now, only, prohibits, up, to, third, cousins, see, article, 809, of, the, korean, civil, code, hmong, culture, prohibits, the, marriage, of, anyone, with, the, same, last, name, to, do, so, would, result, in, being, shunned, by, the, entire, community, and, they, are, usually, stripped, of, their, last, name, in, a, review, of, 48, studies, of, children, parented, by, cousins, the, rate, of, birth, defects, was, twice, that, of, non, related, couples, 4, for, cousin, couples, as, opposed, to, 2, for, the, general, population, some, cultures, include, relatives, by, marriage, in, incest, prohibitions, these, relationships, are, called, affinity, rather, than, consanguinity, for, example, the, question, of, the, legality, and, morality, of, a, widower, who, wished, to, marry, his, deceased, wife, s, sister, was, the, subject, of, long, and, fierce, debate, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, 19th, century, involving, among, others, matthew, boulton, and, charles, la, trobe, the, marriages, were, entered, into, in, scotland, and, switzerland, respectively, where, they, were, legal, in, medieval, europe, lateran, iv, ruled, that, standing, as, a, godparent, to, a, child, also, created, a, bond, of, affinity, which, precluded, legal, marriage, but, in, other, societies, a, deceased, spouse, s, sibling, was, considered, the, ideal, person, to, marry, the, hebrew, bible, forbids, a, man, from, marrying, his, brother, s, widow, with, the, exception, that, if, his, brother, dies, childless, the, man, is, required, to, marry, his, brother, s, widow, so, as, to, raise, up, seed, to, him, some, societies, have, long, practiced, sororal, polygyny, a, form, of, polygamy, in, which, a, man, marries, multiple, wives, who, are, sisters, to, each, other, though, not, closely, related, to, him, in, islamic, law, marriage, among, close, blood, relations, like, parents, stepparents, parents, in, law, siblings, stepsiblings, the, children, of, siblings, aunts, and, uncles, is, forbidden, while, first, or, second, cousins, may, marry, marrying, the, widow, of, a, brother, or, the, sister, of, a, deceased, or, divorced, wife, is, also, allowed, offspring, of, biologically, related, parents, are, subject, to, the, possible, impact, of, inbreeding, such, offspring, have, a, higher, possibility, of, congenital, birth, defects, see, coefficient, of, relationship, because, it, increases, the, proportion, of, zygotes, that, are, homozygous, for, deleterious, recessive, alleles, that, produce, such, disorders, see, inbreeding, depression, because, most, such, alleles, are, rare, in, populations, it, is, unlikely, that, two, unrelated, marriage, partners, will, both, be, heterozygous, carriers, however, because, close, relatives, share, a, large, fraction, of, their, alleles, the, probability, that, any, such, rare, deleterious, allele, present, in, the, common, ancestor, will, be, inherited, from, both, related, parents, is, increased, dramatically, with, respect, to, non, inbred, couples, contrary, to, common, belief, inbreeding, does, not, in, itself, alter, allele, frequencies, but, rather, increases, the, relative, proportion, of, homozygotes, to, heterozygotes, this, has, two, contrary, effects, the, closer, two, persons, are, related, the, higher, the, zygosity, and, thus, the, more, severe, the, biological, costs, of, inbreeding, this, fact, likely, explains, why, inbreeding, between, close, relatives, such, as, siblings, is, less, common, than, inbreeding, between, cousins, there, may, also, be, other, deleterious, effects, besides, those, caused, by, recessive, diseases, thus, similar, immune, systems, may, be, more, vulnerable, to, infectious, diseases, see, major, histocompatibility, complex, and, sexual, selection, a, 1994, study, found, a, mean, excess, mortality, with, inbreeding, among, first, cousins, of, 4, 4, a, 2008, study, also, found, decreased, lifespan, among, offspring, of, first, cousins, but, no, difference, between, lifespans, after, the, second, cousin, level, children, of, parent, child, or, sibling, sibling, unions, are, at, increased, risk, compared, to, cousin, cousin, unions, studies, suggest, that, 20, 36, of, these, children, will, die, or, have, major, disability, due, to, the, inbreeding, a, study, of, 29, offspring, resulting, from, brother, sister, or, father, daughter, incest, found, that, 20, had, congenital, abnormalities, including, four, directly, attributable, to, autosomal, recessive, alleles, laws, regarding, sexual, activity, between, close, relatives, vary, considerably, between, jurisdictions, and, depend, on, the, type, of, sexual, activity, and, the, nature, of, the, family, relationship, of, the, parties, involved, as, well, as, the, age, and, sex, of, the, parties, prohibition, of, incest, laws, may, extend, to, restrictions, on, marriage, rights, which, also, vary, between, jurisdictions, most, jurisdictions, prohibit, parent, child, and, sibling, marriages, while, others, also, prohibit, first, cousin, and, uncle, niece, and, aunt, nephew, marriages, in, most, places, incest, is, illegal, regardless, of, the, ages, of, the, two, partners, in, other, countries, incestuous, relationships, between, consenting, adults, with, the, age, varying, by, location, are, permitted, including, in, the, netherlands, france, slovenia, and, spain, sweden, is, the, only, country, that, allows, marriage, between, half, siblings, and, they, must, seek, government, counseling, before, marriage, while, the, legality, of, consensual, incest, varies, by, country, sexual, assault, committed, against, a, relative, is, seen, as, a, very, serious, crime, in, some, legal, systems, the, fact, of, a, perpetrator, being, a, close, relative, to, the, victim, constitutes, an, aggravating, circumstance, in, the, case, of, sexual, crimes, such, as, rape, and, sexual, conduct, with, a, minor, this, is, the, case, in, romania, according, to, the, torah, per, leviticus, 18, the, children, of, israel, israelite, men, and, women, alike, are, forbidden, from, sexual, relations, between, people, who, are, near, of, kin, verse, 6, who, are, defined, as, and, moses, commanded, the, children, of, israel, according, to, the, word, of, the, lord, saying, the, tribe, of, the, sons, of, joseph, speaketh, right, this, is, the, thing, which, the, lord, hath, commanded, concerning, the, daughters, of, zelophehad, saying, let, them, be, married, to, whom, they, think, best, only, into, the, family, of, the, tribe, of, their, father, shall, they, be, married, so, shall, no, inheritance, of, the, children, of, israel, remove, from, tribe, to, tribe, for, the, children, of, israel, shall, cleave, every, one, to, the, inheritance, of, the, tribe, of, his, fathers, and, every, daughter, that, possesseth, an, inheritance, in, any, tribe, of, the, children, of, israel, shall, be, wife, unto, one, of, the, family, of, the, tribe, of, her, father, that, the, children, of, israel, may, possess, every, man, the, inheritance, of, his, fathers, so, shall, no, inheritance, remove, from, one, tribe, to, another, tribe, for, the, tribes, of, the, children, of, israel, shall, cleave, each, one, to, its, own, inheritance, even, as, the, lord, commanded, moses, so, did, the, daughters, of, zelophehad, for, mahlah, tirzah, and, hoglah, and, milcah, and, noah, the, daughters, of, zelophehad, were, married, unto, their, father, s, brothers, sons, incestuous, relationships, along, with, the, other, forbidden, relationships, that, are, mentioned, in, leviticus, 18, are, considered, so, severe, among, chillulim, hashem, acts, which, bring, shame, to, the, name, of, god, as, to, be, punishable, by, death, as, specified, in, leviticus, 20, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, soferim, scribes, declared, that, there, were, relationships, within, which, marriage, constituted, incest, in, addition, to, those, mentioned, by, the, torah, these, additional, relationships, were, termed, seconds, hebrew, sheniyyot, and, included, the, wives, of, a, man, s, grandfather, and, grandson, the, classical, rabbis, prohibited, marriage, between, a, man, and, any, of, these, seconds, of, his, on, the, basis, that, doing, so, would, act, as, a, safeguard, against, infringing, the, biblical, incest, rules, although, there, was, inconclusive, debate, about, exactly, what, the, limits, should, be, for, the, definition, of, seconds, marriages, that, are, forbidden, in, the, torah, with, the, exception, of, uncle, niece, marriages, were, regarded, by, the, rabbis, of, the, middle, ages, as, invalid, as, if, they, had, never, occurred, any, children, born, to, such, a, couple, were, regarded, as, bastards, under, jewish, law, and, the, relatives, of, the, spouse, were, not, regarded, as, forbidden, relations, for, a, further, marriage, on, the, other, hand, relationships, that, were, prohibited, due, to, qualifying, as, seconds, and, so, forth, were, regarded, as, wicked, but, still, valid, while, such, a, couple, may, have, been, pressured, to, divorce, any, children, of, the, union, were, still, seen, as, legitimate, the, new, testament, condemns, relations, between, a, man, and, his, father, s, wife, 1, corinthians, 5, 1, 5, it, is, inevitable, for, bible, literalists, to, accept, that, the, first, children, of, adam, and, eve, would, have, been, in, incestuous, relations, as, we, regard, it, today, however, according, to, the, bible, god, s, law, forbidding, incest, had, not, at, that, time, been, given, to, men, and, was, delivered, to, moses, after, adam, and, eve, were, created, protestant, christians, who, adopt, the, old, testament, as, part, of, their, rule, of, faith, and, practice, make, a, distinction, between, the, ceremonial, law, and, the, moral, law, given, to, moses, with, the, demands, of, the, ceremonial, law, being, fulfilled, by, christ, s, atoning, death, protestants, view, leviticus, 18, 6, 20, as, part, of, the, moral, law, and, still, applicable, thus, condemning, sexual, marriage, relations, between, a, man, and, his, mother, sister, stepsister, stepmother, if, a, man, has, more, than, one, wife, it, is, forbidden, for, a, son, to, have, relations, with, or, marry, any, of, his, father, s, wives, aunt, granddaughter, or, his, brother, s, wife, leviticus, 18, goes, on, to, condemn, relations, between, a, man, and, the, daughter, of, a, woman, he, is, having, relations, with, and, the, sister, of, a, woman, he, has, had, sexual, relations, with, while, the, first, sister, is, still, alive, the, book, of, common, prayer, of, the, anglican, communion, allows, marriages, up, to, and, including, first, cousins, the, catholic, church, regards, incest, as, a, sin, against, the, sacrament, of, matrimony, for, the, catholic, church, at, the, heart, of, the, immorality, of, incest, is, the, corruption, and, disordering, of, proper, family, relations, these, disordered, relationships, take, on, a, particularly, grave, and, immoral, character, when, it, becomes, child, sexual, abuse, as, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, says, 2388, incest, designates, intimate, relations, between, relatives, or, in, laws, within, a, degree, that, prohibits, marriage, between, them, st, paul, stigmatizes, this, especially, grave, offense, it, is, actually, reported, that, there, is, immorality, among, you, for, a, man, is, living, with, his, father, s, wife, in, the, name, of, the, lord, jesus, you, are, to, deliver, this, man, to, satan, for, the, destruction, of, the, flesh, incest, corrupts, family, relationships, and, marks, a, regression, toward, animality, 2389, connected, to, incest, is, any, sexual, abuse, perpetrated, by, adults, on, children, or, adolescents, entrusted, to, their, care, the, offense, is, compounded, by, the, scandalous, harm, done, to, the, physical, and, moral, integrity, of, the, young, who, will, remain, scarred, by, it, all, their, lives, and, the, violation, of, responsibility, for, their, upbringing, the, quran, gives, specific, rules, regarding, incest, which, prohibit, a, man, from, marrying, or, having, sexual, relationships, with, cousin, marriage, finds, support, in, islamic, scriptures, and, is, widespread, in, the, middle, east, although, islam, allows, cousin, marriage, there, are, hadiths, attributed, to, muhammad, calling, for, distance, from, the, marriage, of, relatives, however, muslim, scholars, generally, consider, these, hadiths, unreliable, in, ancient, persia, incest, between, cousins, is, a, blessed, virtue, although, in, some, sources, incest, is, believed, to, be, related, to, that, of, parent, child, or, brother, sister, under, zoroastrianism, royalty, clergy, and, commoners, practiced, incest, though, the, extent, in, the, lattermost, class, was, unknown, this, tradition, was, called, xwedodah, avestan, x, a, tuuada, a, romanized, xvaetvadatha, the, tradition, was, considered, so, sacred, that, the, bodily, fluids, produced, by, an, incestuous, couple, were, thought, to, have, curative, powers, for, instance, the, vendidad, advised, corpse, bearers, to, purify, themselves, with, a, mixture, of, the, urine, of, a, married, incestuous, couple, friedrich, nietzsche, in, his, book, the, birth, of, tragedy, cited, that, among, zoroastrians, a, wise, priest, is, born, only, by, xvaetvadatha, to, what, extent, xvaetvadatha, was, practiced, in, sasanian, iran, and, before, especially, outside, the, royal, and, noble, families, dynastic, incest, and, perhaps, the, clergy, and, whether, practices, ascribed, to, them, can, be, assumed, to, be, characteristic, of, the, general, population, is, not, clear, there, is, a, lack, of, genealogies, and, census, material, on, the, frequency, of, xvaetvadatha, evidence, from, dura, europos, however, combined, with, that, of, the, jewish, and, christian, sources, citing, actual, cases, under, the, sasanians, strengthens, the, evidence, of, the, zoroastrian, texts, in, the, post, sasanian, zoroastrian, literature, xvaetvadatha, is, said, to, refer, to, marriages, between, cousins, instead, which, have, always, been, relatively, common, it, has, been, observed, that, such, incestuous, acts, received, a, great, deal, of, glorification, as, a, religious, practice, and, in, addition, to, being, condemned, by, foreigners, though, the, reliability, of, these, accusations, is, questionable, since, accusations, of, incest, were, a, common, way, of, denigrating, other, groups, were, considered, a, great, challenge, by, their, own, proponents, with, accounts, suggesting, that, four, copulations, was, deemed, a, rare, achievement, worthy, of, eternal, salvation, it, has, been, suggested, that, because, taking, up, incestuous, relations, was, a, great, personal, challenge, seemingly, repugnant, even, to, zoroastrians, of, the, time, it, served, as, an, honest, signal, of, commitment, and, devotion, to, religious, ideals, rigveda, regards, incest, to, be, evil, hinduism, speaks, of, incest, in, abhorrent, terms, hindus, believe, there, are, both, karmic, and, practical, bad, effects, of, incest, and, thus, practice, strict, rules, of, both,

traditional, matrimonial, system, people, within, the, gotra, are, regarded, as, kin, and, marrying, such, a, person, would, be, thought, of, as, incest, marriage, with, paternal, cousins, a, form, of, parallel, cousin, relationship, is, strictly, prohibited, traditional, hindu, laws, of, marriage, suggest, that, between, a, man, and, a, woman, who, are, about, to, marry, there, should, be, no,

the, groom, and, bride, some, orthodox, hindus, might, extend, this, limit, to, up, to, 8, generations, on, the, father, s, side, and, 6, generations, on, the, mother, s, side, for, both, the, bride, and, groom, although, generally, marriages, between, persons, having, the, same, gotra, are, frowned, upon, how, this, is, defined, may, vary, regionally, depending, on, culture, and, caste, of, the, population, in, the, region, marriage, may, be, restricted, up, to, seven, generations, of, gotra, of, father, mother, and, grandmother, in, a, few, rural, areas, marriage, is, banned, within, the, same, local, community, the, founder, of, stoicism, zeno, of, citium, stated, that, incest, was, permissible, in, republic, as, did, the, later, prominent, stoic, philosopher, chrysippus, however, zeno, only, advocates, for, incest, under, unique, circumstances, such, as, procreating, with, one, s, ailing, mother, in, order, to, beget, glorious, children, thus, comforting, her, otherwise, incest, is, condemned, as, being, contrary, to, nature, zeno, further, condemns, incest, from, a, moral, and, psychological, perspective, considering, it, to, be, a, sign, of, plato, s, tyrannical, soul, defined, as, a, soul, that, is, governed, by, illimitable, desire, he, uses, oedipus, as, a, tragic, example, nonetheless, later, stoic, disciples, by, the, 1st, century, bc, downplayed, the,
