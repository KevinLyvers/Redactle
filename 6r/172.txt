infidelity, synonyms, include, non, consensual, non, monogamy, cheating, straying, adultery, being, unfaithful, two, timing, or, having, an, affair, is, a, violation, of, a, couple, s, emotional, or, sexual, exclusivity, that, commonly, results, in, feelings, of, anger, sexual, jealousy, and, rivalry, what, constitutes, infidelity, depends, on, expectations, within, the, relationship, in, marital, relationships, exclusivity, is, commonly, assumed, infidelity, can, cause, psychological, damage, including, feelings, of, rage, and, betrayal, depression, low, sexual, and, personal, confidence, and, even, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, people, of, both, sexes, can, experience, social, consequences, if, their, act, of, infidelity, becomes, public, but, the, form, and, extent, of, these, consequences, can, depend, on, the, gender, of, the, unfaithful, person, after, the, kinsey, reports, came, out, in, the, early, 1950s, findings, suggested, that, historically, and, cross, culturally, extramarital, sex, has, been, a, matter, of, regulation, more, than, sex, before, marriage, the, kinsey, reports, found, that, around, half, of, men, and, a, quarter, of, women, studied, had, committed, adultery, the, janus, report, on, sexual, behavior, in, america, also, reported, that, one, third, of, married, men, and, a, quarter, of, women, have, had, an, extramarital, affair, according, to, the, new, york, times, the, most, consistent, data, on, infidelity, comes, from, the, university, of, chicago, s, general, social, survey, gss, interviews, with, people, in, monogamous, relationships, since, 1972, by, the, gss, have, shown, that, approximately, 12, of, men, and, 7, of, women, admit, to, having, had, an, extramarital, relationship, results, however, vary, year, by, year, and, also, by, age, group, surveyed, for, example, one, study, conducted, by, the, university, of, washington, seattle, found, slightly, or, significantly, higher, rates, of, infidelity, for, populations, under, 35, or, older, than, 60, in, that, study, which, involved, 19, 065, people, during, a, 15, year, period, rates, of, infidelity, among, men, were, found, to, have, risen, from, 20, to, 28, and, rates, for, women, ranged, from, 5, to, 15, in, more, recent, nationwide, surveys, several, researchers, found, that, about, twice, as, many, men, as, women, reported, having, an, extramarital, affair, a, survey, conducted, in, 1990, found, that, 2, 2, of, married, participants, reported, having, more, than, one, partner, during, the, past, year, in, general, national, surveys, conducted, in, the, early, 1990s, reported, that, between, 15, and, 25, of, married, americans, reported, having, extramarital, affairs, people, who, had, stronger, sexual, interests, more, permissive, sexual, values, lower, subjective, satisfaction, with, their, partner, weaker, network, ties, to, their, partner, and, greater, sexual, opportunities, were, more, likely, to, be, unfaithful, studies, suggest, around, 30, 40, of, unmarried, relationships, and, 18, 20, of, marriages, see, at, least, one, incident, of, sexual, infidelity, rates, of, infidelity, among, women, are, thought, to, increase, with, age, in, one, study, rates, were, higher, in, more, recent, marriages, compared, with, previous, generations, men, were, found, to, be, only, somewhat, more, likely, than, women, to, engage, in, infidelity, with, rates, for, both, sexes, becoming, increasingly, similar, another, study, found, that, the, likelihood, of, women, being, involved, in, infidelity, reached, a, peak, in, the, seventh, year, of, their, marriage, and, then, declined, afterward, for, married, men, the, longer, they, were, in, relationships, the, less, likely, they, were, to, engage, in, infidelity, until, the, eighteenth, year, of, marriage, at, which, point, the, chance, of, men, engaging, in, infidelity, began, to, increase, research, on, pregnancy, and, its, effects, on, sexual, desire, and, rates, of, infidelity, conducted, in, southern, spain, indicated, that, men, were, more, likely, to, engage, in, infidelity, while, their, partner, was, pregnant, it, was, estimated, that, 1, in, 10, fathers, to, be, engaged, in, infidelity, at, some, point, during, their, partner, s, pregnancy, and, suggested, that, the, likelihood, of, the, man, engaging, in, infidelity, increases, as, the, woman, s, pregnancy, progresses, through, its, trimesters, one, measure, of, infidelity, is, paternal, discrepancy, a, situation, that, arises, when, someone, who, is, presumed, to, be, a, child, s, father, is, in, fact, not, the, biological, parent, frequencies, as, high, as, 30, are, sometimes, assumed, in, the, media, but, research, by, sociologist, michael, gilding, traced, these, overestimates, back, to, an, informal, remark, at, a, 1972, conference, the, detection, of, paternal, discrepancy, can, occur, in, the, context, of, medical, genetic, screening, in, genetic, family, name, research, and, in, immigration, testing, such, studies, show, that, paternal, discrepancy, is, in, fact, less, than, 10, among, the, sampled, african, populations, less, than, 5, among, the, sampled, native, american, and, polynesian, populations, less, than, 2, of, the, sampled, middle, eastern, population, and, generally, 1, 2, among, european, samples, differences, in, sexual, infidelity, as, a, function, of, gender, have, been, commonly, reported, it, is, more, common, for, men, compared, to, women, to, engage, in, extradyadic, relationships, the, national, health, and, social, life, survey, found, that, 4, of, married, men, 16, of, cohabiting, men, and, 37, of, dating, men, engaged, in, acts, of, sexual, infidelity, in, the, previous, year, compared, to, 1, of, married, women, 8, of, cohabiting, women, and, 17, of, women, in, dating, relationships, these, differences, have, been, generally, thought, due, to, evolutionary, pressures, that, motivate, men, towards, sexual, opportunity, and, women, towards, commitment, to, one, partner, for, reasons, such, as, reproductive, success, stability, and, social, expectations, in, addition, recent, research, finds, that, differences, in, gender, may, possibly, be, explained, by, other, mechanisms, including, power, and, sensations, seeking, for, example, one, study, found, that, some, women, in, more, financially, independent, and, higher, positions, of, power, were, also, more, likely, to, be, more, unfaithful, to, their, partners, in, another, study, when, the, tendency, to, sensation, seek, i, e, engage, in, risky, behaviours, was, controlled, for, there, were, no, gender, differences, in, the, likelihood, to, being, unfaithful, these, findings, suggest, there, may, be, various, factors, that, might, influence, the, likelihood, of, some, individuals, to, engage, in, extradyadic, relationships, and, that, such, factors, may, account, for, observed, gender, differences, beyond, actual, gender, and, evolutionary, pressures, associated, with, each, there, is, currently, debate, in, the, field, of, evolutionary, psychology, whether, an, innate, evolved, sex, difference, exists, between, men, and, women, in, response, to, an, act, of, infidelity, this, is, often, called, a, sex, difference, a, study, published, in, 2002, suggested, there, may, be, sex, differences, in, jealousy, those, that, posit, a, sex, difference, exists, state, that, men, are, 60, more, likely, to, be, disturbed, by, an, act, of, sexual, infidelity, having, one, s, partner, engage, in, sexual, relations, with, another, whereas, women, are, 83, more, likely, to, be, disturbed, by, an, act, of, emotional, infidelity, having, one, s, partner, fall, in, love, with, another, those, against, this, model, argue, that, there, is, no, difference, between, men, and, women, in, their, response, to, an, act, of, infidelity, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, men, are, theorized, to, maximize, their, fitness, by, investing, as, little, as, possible, in, their, offspring, and, producing, as, many, offspring, as, possible, due, to, the, risk, of, males, investing, in, children, that, are, not, theirs, women, who, do, not, face, the, risk, of, cuckoldry, are, theorized, to, maximize, their, fitness, by, investing, as, much, as, possible, in, their, offspring, because, they, invest, at, least, nine, months, of, resources, towards, their, offspring, in, pregnancy, maximizing, female, fitness, is, theorized, to, require, males, in, the, relationship, to, invest, all, their, resources, in, the, offspring, these, conflicting, strategies, are, theorized, to, have, resulted, in, selection, of, different, jealousy, mechanisms, that, are, designed, to, enhance, the, fitness, of, the, respective, gender, a, common, way, to, test, whether, an, innate, jealousy, response, exists, between, sexes, is, to, use, a, forced, choice, questionnaire, this, style, of, questionnaire, asks, participants, yes, or, no, and, response, a, or, response, b, style, questions, about, certain, scenarios, for, example, a, question, might, ask, if, you, found, your, partner, cheating, on, you, would, you, be, more, upset, by, a, the, sexual, involvement, or, b, the, emotional, involvement, many, studies, using, forced, choice, questionnaires, have, found, statistically, significant, results, supporting, an, innate, sex, difference, between, men, and, women, furthermore, studies, have, shown, that, this, observation, holds, across, many, cultures, although, the, magnitudes, of, the, sex, difference, vary, within, sexes, across, cultures, although, forced, choice, questionnaires, show, a, statistically, significant, sex, difference, critics, of, the, theory, of, evolved, sex, differences, in, jealousy, question, these, findings, in, consideration, of, the, entire, body, of, work, on, sex, differences, c, f, harris, asserted, that, when, methods, other, than, forced, choice, questionnaires, are, used, to, identify, an, innate, sex, difference, inconsistencies, between, studies, begin, to, arise, for, example, researchers, found, that, women, sometimes, report, feeling, more, intense, jealousy, in, response, to, both, sexual, and, emotional, infidelity, the, results, of, these, studies, also, depended, on, the, context, in, which, the, participants, were, made, to, describe, what, type, of, jealousy, they, felt, as, well, as, the, intensity, of, their, jealousy, in, her, meta, analysis, harris, raises, the, question, of, whether, forced, choice, questionnaires, actually, measure, what, they, purport, jealousy, itself, and, evidence, that, differences, in, jealousy, arise, from, innate, mechanisms, her, meta, analysis, reveals, that, sex, differences, are, almost, exclusively, found, in, forced, choice, studies, according, to, harris, a, meta, analysis, of, multiple, types, of, studies, should, indicate, a, convergence, of, evidence, and, multiple, operationalizations, this, is, not, the, case, which, raises, the, question, as, to, the, validity, of, forced, choice, studies, desteno, and, bartlett, 2002, further, support, this, argument, by, providing, evidence, which, indicates, that, significant, results, of, forced, choice, studies, may, actually, be, an, artifact, of, measurement, this, finding, would, invalidate, many, of, the, claims, made, by, those, in, favor, of, an, innate, sex, difference, even, those, in, favor, of, sex, differences, admit, that, certain, lines, of, research, such, as, homicide, studies, suggest, against, the, possibility, of, sex, differences, these, inconsistent, results, have, led, researchers, to, propose, novel, theories, that, attempt, to, explain, the, sex, differences, observed, in, certain, studies, one, theory, that, has, been, hypothesized, to, explain, why, men, and, women, both, report, more, distress, to, emotional, infidelity, than, sexual, infidelity, is, borrowed, from, childhood, attachment, theories, studies, have, found, that, attachment, styles, of, adults, are, consistent, with, their, self, reported, relationship, histories, for, example, more, men, are, reported, to, have, an, insecure, dismissing, avoidant, attachment, style, where, these, individuals, often, attempt, to, minimize, or, constrict, emotional, experience, deny, needs, for, intimacy, are, highly, invested, in, autonomy, and, are, more, sexually, promiscuous, than, individuals, who, have, other, attachment, styles, levy, and, kelly, 2010, tested, this, theory, and, found, that, adult, attachment, styles, strongly, correlate, to, which, type, of, infidelity, elicited, more, jealousy, individuals, who, have, secure, attachment, styles, often, report, that, emotional, infidelity, is, more, upsetting, whereas, dismissing, attachment, styles, were, more, likely, to, find, sexual, infidelity, more, upsetting, their, study, did, report, that, men, in, general, were, more, likely, than, women, to, report, sexual, infidelity, as, more, distressing, however, this, could, be, related, to, more, men, having, a, dismissing, attachment, style, the, authors, propose, that, a, social, mechanism, may, be, responsible, for, the, observed, results, in, other, words, replicable, sex, differences, in, emotion, and, sexual, jealousy, could, be, a, function, of, a, social, function, similar, studies, focusing, on, the, masculinization, and, feminization, by, society, also, argue, for, a, social, explanation, while, discounting, an, evolutionary, explanation, a, 2015, study, found, a, correlation, between, avpr1a, expression, and, predisposition, to, extrapair, mating, in, women, but, not, in, men, evolutionary, researchers, have, suggested, that, men, and, women, have, innate, mechanisms, that, contribute, to, why, they, become, sexually, jealous, this, is, especially, true, for, certain, types, of, infidelity, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, heterosexual, men, have, developed, an, innate, psychological, mechanism, that, responds, to, the, threat, of, sexual, infidelity, more, than, emotional, infidelity, and, vice, versa, for, heterosexual, women, because, potential, cuckoldry, is, more, detrimental, to, the, male, who, could, potentially, invest, in, offspring, of, another, male, while, for, females, emotional, infidelity, is, more, worrisome, because, they, could, lose, the, parental, investment, to, another, woman, s, offspring, therefore, affecting, their, chances, of, survival, however, more, recent, studies, suggest, that, increasingly, both, men, and, women, would, find, emotional, infidelity, psychologically, worse, symons, 1979, determined, that, sexual, jealousy, is, the, major, reason, that, many, homosexual, men, are, unsuccessful, in, maintaining, monogamous, relationships, and, suggests, that, all, men, are, innately, disposed, to, want, sexual, variation, with, the, difference, between, heterosexual, and, homosexual, men, being, that, homosexual, men, can, find, willing, partners, more, often, for, casual, sex, and, thus, satisfy, this, innate, desire, for, sexual, variety, however, according, to, this, view, all, men, can, be, hard, wired, to, be, sexually, jealous, and, therefore, gay, men, could, be, more, upset, by, sexual, infidelity, than, by, emotional, infidelity, and, that, lesbians, could, be, more, upset, by, emotional, infidelity, than, sexual, recent, studies, suggest, that, it, may, not, be, an, innate, mechanism, rather, depends, on, the, importance, placed, on, sexual, exclusivity, peplau, and, cochran, 1983, found, that, sexual, exclusivity, was, much, more, important, to, heterosexual, men, and, women, compared, to, homosexual, men, and, women, this, theory, suggests, that, it, is, not, sexuality, that, may, lead, to, differences, but, that, people, are, prone, to, jealousy, in, domains, that, are, especially, important, to, them, barah, and, lipton, argue, that, heterosexual, couples, may, cheat, just, as, much, as, homosexual, relationships, harris, 2002, tested, these, hypotheses, among, 210, individuals, 48, homosexual, women, 50, homosexual, men, 40, heterosexual, women, and, 49, heterosexual, men, results, found, that, more, heterosexual, than, homosexual, individuals, picked, sexual, infidelity, as, worse, than, emotional, infidelity, with, heterosexual, men, being, the, highest, and, that, when, forced, to, choose, gay, men, overwhelmingly, predicted, emotional, infidelity, would, be, more, troubling, than, sexual, infidelity, these, findings, contradict, symons, 1979, suggestion, that, there, would, be, no, gender, difference, in, predicted, responses, to, infidelity, by, sexual, orientation, blow, and, bartlett, 2005, suggest, that, even, though, sex, outside, of, a, homosexual, relationship, might, be, seen, as, more, acceptable, in, some, relationships, the, consequences, of, infidelity, do, not, occur, without, pain, or, jealousy, heterosexuals, rated, emotional, and, sexual, infidelity, as, more, emotionally, distressing, than, did, lesbian, and, gay, individuals, sex, and, sexual, orientation, differences, emerged, regarding, the, degree, to, which, specific, emotions, were, reported, in, response, to, sexual, and, emotional, infidelity, few, researchers, have, explored, the, influence, of, sexual, orientation, on, which, type, of, infidelity, is, viewed, as, more, distressing, summarizing, the, findings, from, these, studies, heterosexual, men, seem, to, be, more, distressed, by, sexual, infidelity, than, heterosexual, women, lesbian, women, and, gay, men, these, latter, three, groups, seem, more, responsible, for, this, difference, by, reporting, similarly, higher, levels, of, distress, toward, emotional, infidelity, than, heterosexual, men, however, within, sex, analyses, reveal, that, heterosexual, men, tend, to, rate, emotional, infidelity, as, more, distressing, than, sexual, infidelity, some, studies, suggest, that, only, a, small, percentage, of, couples, that, experience, infidelity, actually, improve, their, relationship, whereas, others, report, couples, having, surprisingly, positive, relationship, outcomes, in, terms, of, negative, responses, to, infidelity, charney, and, parnass, 1995, report, that, after, hearing, of, a, partner, s, infidelity, reactions, have, included, rage, and, increased, aggressiveness, loss, of, trust, decreased, personal, and, sexual, confidence, sadness, depression, damaged, self, esteem, fear, of, abandonment, and, a, surge, of, justification, to, leave, their, partner, another, study, reported, that, nearly, 60, of, the, partners, that, were, cheated, on, had, emotional, problems, and, depression, following, disclosure, of, the, affair, other, negative, consequences, have, included, damage, to, relationships, with, children, parents, and, friends, as, well, as, legal, consequences, a, report, in, 1983, detailed, that, of, a, sample, of, 205, divorced, individuals, about, one, half, said, their, marital, problems, were, caused, by, their, spouse, s, infidelity, the, negative, impact, of, infidelity, on, a, relationship, depends, on, how, involved, partners, are, in, their, infidelity, relationship, and, researchers, maintain, that, infidelity, itself, does, not, cause, divorce, but, the, overall, level, of, relationship, satisfaction, motives, for, infidelity, level, of, conflict, and, attitudes, held, about, infidelity, do, in, fact, schneider, et, al, 1999, reported, that, even, though, 60, of, their, participants, initially, threatened, to, leave, their, primary, relationship, a, threat, to, leave, due, to, infidelity, did, not, actually, predict, the, eventual, outcome, atkins, eldridge, baucom, and, christiansen, found, that, couples, who, went, through, therapy, as, well, as, openly, dealt, with, the, infidelity, were, able, to, change, at, a, faster, rate, than, distressed, couples, who, were, just, in, therapy, some, unintended, positive, outcomes, that, have, been, reported, for, couples, experiencing, infidelity, include, closer, marital, relationships, increased, assertiveness, taking, better, care, of, oneself, placing, higher, value, on, family, and, realizing, the, importance, of, marital, communication, if, divorce, results, from, infidelity, research, suggest, that, the, faithful, spouse, may, experience, feelings, of, low, life, satisfaction, and, self, esteem, they, may, also, engage, in, future, relationships, fearful, of, the, same, incidence, occurring, sweeney, and, horwitz, 2001, found, that, individuals, who, initiated, a, divorce, after, hearing, about, their, partner, s, infidelity, experienced, less, depression, however, the, opposite, was, true, when, the, offending, spouse, initiated, divorce, according, to, attachment, theory, intimates, evaluate, the, availability, of, close, others, and, respond, to, them, accordingly, while, those, with, a, secure, attachment, style, believe, others, are, available, to, them, those, with, insecure, attachment, believe, others, are, less, available, to, them, people, who, develop, high, levels, of, attachment, have, more, anxiety, and, uncertainty, they, cope, by, seeking, reassurance, and, clinging, themselves, to, another, person, in, attachment, theory, people, seek, sex, to, help, meet, their, needs, those, whose, partners, are, unfaithful, may, experience, anxiety, stress, and, depression, they, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, activities, that, are, risky, to, their, health, women, who, experienced, negative, appraisals, like, self, blame, and, causal, attribution, led, to, emotional, distress, and, increased, health, compromising, behavior, gender, self, esteem, greatly, affects, infidelity, different, factors, for, the, two, genders, are, known, to, influence, jealousy, heterosexual, men, seem, to, be, more, distressed, by, sexual, infidelity, than, heterosexual, women, lesbian, women, and, gay, men, the, latter, three, groups, seem, more, responsible, for, the, difference, by, reporting, similarly, higher, levels, of, distress, toward, emotional, infidelity, than, heterosexual, men, studies, have, found, that, men, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, extramarital, sex, if, they, are, unsatisfied, sexually, while, women, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, extramarital, sex, if, they, are, unsatisfied, emotionally, kimmel, and, van, der, veen, found, that, sexual, satisfaction, may, be, more, important, to, husbands, and, that, wives, are, more, concerned, with, compatibility, with, their, partners, studies, suggest, that, individuals, who, can, separate, concepts, of, sex, and, love, are, more, likely, to, accept, situations, where, infidelity, occurs, one, study, done, by, roscoe, cavanaugh, and, kennedy, found, that, women, indicated, relationship, dissatisfaction, as, the, number, one, reason, for, infidelity, whereas, men, reported, a, lack, of, communication, understanding, and, sexual, incompatibility, glass, and, wright, also, found, that, men, and, women, who, are, involved, in, both, sexual, and, emotional, infidelities, reported, being, the, most, dissatisfied, in, their, relationships, than, those, who, engaged, in, either, sexual, or, emotional, infidelity, alone, in, general, marital, dissatisfaction, overall, is, the, number, one, reason, often, reported, for, infidelity, for, both, sexes, it, is, important, to, note, that, there, are, many, other, factors, that, increase, the, likelihood, of, anyone, engaging, in, infidelity, individuals, exhibiting, sexually, permissive, attitudes, and, those, who, have, had, a, high, number, of, past, sexual, relationships, are, also, more, likely, to, engage, in, infidelity, other, factors, such, as, being, well, educated, living, in, an, urban, centre, being, less, religious, having, a, liberal, ideology, and, values, having, more, opportunities, to, meet, potential, partners, and, being, older, affected, the, likelihood, of, one, being, involved, in, an, extramarital, affair, anthropologists, tend, to, believe, humans, are, neither, completely, monogamous, nor, completely, polygamous, anthropologist, bobbi, low, says, we, are, slightly, polygamous, while, deborah, blum, believes, we, are, ambiguously, monogamous, and, slowly, moving, away, from, the, polygamous, habits, of, our, evolutionary, ancestors, according, to, anthropologist, helen, fisher, there, are, numerous, psychological, reasons, for, adultery, some, people, may, want, to, supplement, a, marriage, solve, a, sex, problem, gather, more, attention, seek, revenge, or, have, more, excitement, in, the, marriage, but, based, on, fisher, s, research, there, also, is, a, biological, side, to, adultery, we, have, two, brain, systems, one, of, them, is, linked, to, attachment, and, romantic, love, and, then, there, is, the, other, brain, system, which, is, purely, sex, drive, sometimes, these, two, brain, systems, are, not, well, connected, which, enables, people, to, become, adulterers, and, satisfy, their, libido, without, any, regards, to, their, attachment, side, often, gender, differences, in, both, jealousy, and, infidelity, are, attributable, to, cultural, factors, this, variation, stems, from, the, fact, that, societies, differ, in, how, they, view, extramarital, affairs, and, jealousy, an, examination, of, jealousy, across, seven, nations, revealed, that, each, partner, in, a, relationship, serves, as, each, other, s, primary, and, exclusive, source, of, satisfaction, and, attention, in, all, cultures, therefore, when, an, individual, feels, jealousy, towards, another, it, is, usually, because, they, are, now, sharing, their, primary, source, of, attention, and, satisfaction, however, variation, can, be, seen, when, identifying, the, behaviors, and, actions, that, betray, the, role, of, primary, attention, satisfaction, giver, for, instance, in, certain, cultures, if, an, individual, goes, out, with, another, of, the, opposite, gender, emotions, of, intense, jealousy, can, result, however, in, other, cultures, this, behavior, is, perfectly, acceptable, and, is, not, given, much, thought, it, is, important, to, understand, where, these, cultural, variations, come, from, and, how, they, root, themselves, into, differing, perceptions, of, infidelity, while, many, cultures, report, infidelity, as, wrong, and, admonish, it, some, are, more, tolerant, of, such, behaviour, these, views, are, generally, linked, to, the, overall, liberal, nature, of, the, society, for, instance, danish, society, is, viewed, as, more, liberal, than, many, other, cultures, and, as, such, have, correlating, liberal, views, on, infidelity, and, extramarital, affairs, according, to, christine, harris, and, nicholas, christenfeld, societies, that, are, legally, more, liberal, against, extramarital, affairs, judge, less, harshly, upon, sexual, infidelity, because, it, is, distinct, from, emotional, infidelity, in, danish, society, having, sex, does, not, necessarily, imply, a, deep, emotional, attachment, as, a, result, infidelity, does, not, carry, such, a, severe, negative, connotation, a, comparison, between, modern, day, chinese, and, american, societies, showed, that, there, was, greater, distress, with, sexual, infidelity, in, the, u, s, than, in, china, the, cultural, difference, is, most, likely, due, to, the, more, restrictive, nature, of, chinese, society, thus, making, infidelity, a, more, salient, concern, sexual, promiscuity, is, more, prominent, in, the, united, states, thus, it, follows, that, american, society, is, more, preoccupied, with, infidelity, than, chinese, society, often, a, single, predominant, religion, can, influence, the, culture, of, an, entire, nation, even, within, christianity, in, the, united, states, there, are, discrepancies, as, to, how, extramarital, affairs, are, viewed, for, instance, protestants, and, catholics, do, not, view, infidelity, with, equal, severity, the, conception, of, marriage, is, also, markedly, different, while, in, roman, catholicism, marriage, is, seen, as, an, indissoluble, sacramental, bond, and, does, not, permit, divorce, even, in, cases, of, infidelity, most, protestant, denominations, allow, for, divorce, and, remarriage, for, infidelity, or, other, reasons, ultimately, it, was, seen, that, adults, that, associated, with, a, religion, any, denomination, were, found, to, view, infidelity, as, much, more, distressing, than, those, who, were, not, affiliated, with, a, religion, those, that, participated, more, heavily, in, their, religions, were, even, more, conservative, in, their, views, on, infidelity, some, research, has, also, suggested, that, being, african, american, has, a, positive, correlation, to, infidelity, even, when, education, attainment, is, controlled, for, other, research, suggests, that, lifetime, incidence, of, infidelity, does, not, differ, between, african, americans, and, whites, only, the, likelihood, of, when, they, engage, in, it, race, and, gender, have, been, found, to, be, positively, correlated, with, infidelity, however, this, is, the, case, more, often, for, african, american, men, engaging, in, extramarital, infidelity, human, mating, strategies, differ, from, culture, to, culture, for, example, schmitt, discusses, how, tribal, cultures, with, higher, pathogen, stress, are, more, likely, to, have, polygynous, marriage, systems, whereas, monogamous, mating, systems, usually, have, relatively, lower, high, pathogen, environments, in, addition, researchers, have, also, proposed, the, idea, that, high, mortality, rates, in, local, cultures, should, be, correlated, with, more, permissive, mating, strategies, on, the, other, hand, schmitt, discusses, how, demanding, reproductive, environments, should, increase, the, desire, and, pursuit, of, biparental, monogamous, relationships, strategic, pluralism, is, a, theory, that, focuses, on, how, environmental, factors, influence, mating, strategies, according, to, this, theory, when, people, live, within, environments, that, are, demanding, and, stressful, the, need, for, bi, parental, care, is, greater, for, increasing, the, survival, of, offspring, correspondingly, monogamy, and, commitment, are, more, commonplace, on, the, other, hand, when, people, live, within, environments, that, encompass, little, stress, and, threats, to, the, viability, of, offspring, the, need, for, serious, and, committed, relations, is, lowered, and, therefore, promiscuity, and, infidelity, are, more, common, sex, ratio, theory, is, a, theory, that, explains, the, relationship, and, sexual, dynamics, within, different, areas, of, the, world, based, on, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, marriage, aged, men, to, marriage, aged, women, according, to, this, theory, an, area, has, a, high, sex, ratio, when, there, is, a, higher, number, of, marriage, aged, women, to, marriage, aged, men, and, an, area, has, a, low, sex, ratio, when, there, are, more, marriage, aged, men, in, terms, of, infidelity, the, theory, states, that, when, sex, ratios, are, high, men, are, more, likely, to, be, promiscuous, and, engage, in, sex, outside, of, a, committed, relationship, because, the, demand, for, men, is, higher, and, this, type, of, behavior, desired, by, men, is, more, accepted, on, the, other, hand, when, sex, ratios, are, low, promiscuity, is, less, common, because, women, are, in, demand, and, since, they, desire, monogamy, and, commitment, in, order, for, men, to, remain, competitive, in, the, pool, of, mates, they, must, respond, to, these, desires, support, for, this, theory, comes, from, evidence, showing, higher, divorce, rates, in, countries, with, higher, sex, ratios, and, higher, monogamy, rates, in, countries, with, lower, sex, ratios, while, infidelity, is, by, no, means, exclusive, to, certain, groups, of, people, its, perception, can, be, influenced, by, other, factors, furthermore, within, a, homogeneous, culture, like, that, in, the, united, states, factors, like, community, size, can, be, strong, predictors, of, how, infidelity, is, perceived, larger, communities, tend, to, care, less, about, infidelity, whereas, small, towns, are, much, more, concerned, with, such, issues, these, patterns, are, observed, in, other, cultures, as, well, for, example, a, cantina, in, a, small, rural, mexican, community, is, often, viewed, as, a, place, where, decent, or, married, women, do, not, go, because, of, its, semi, private, nature, conversely, public, spaces, like, the, market, or, plaza, are, acceptable, areas, for, heterosexual, interaction, a, smaller, population, size, presents, the, threat, of, being, publicly, recognized, for, infidelity, however, within, a, larger, community, of, the, same, mexican, society, entering, a, bar, or, watering, hole, would, garner, a, different, view, it, would, be, deemed, perfectly, acceptable, for, both, married, and, unmarried, individuals, to, drink, at, a, bar, in, a, large, city, these, observations, can, be, paralleled, to, rural, and, urban, societies, in, the, united, states, as, well, ultimately, these, variables, and, societal, differences, dictate, attitudes, towards, sexual, infidelity, which, can, vary, across, cultures, as, well, as, within, cultures, mate, poaching, is, the, phenomenon, of, a, single, person, luring, a, person, who, is, in, an, intimate, relationship, to, leave, their, partner, for, the, single, person, according, to, a, survey, of, 16, 964, individuals, in, 53, countries, by, david, schmitt, 2001, mate, poaching, happens, significantly, more, frequently, in, middle, eastern, countries, such, as, turkey, and, lebanon, and, less, frequently, in, east, asian, countries, such, as, china, and, japan, the, parental, investment, theory, is, used, to, explain, evolutionary, pressures, that, can, account, for, sex, differences, in, infidelity, this, theory, states, that, the, sex, that, invests, less, in, the, offspring, has, more, to, gain, from, indiscriminate, sexual, behaviour, this, means, that, women, who, typically, invest, more, time, and, energy, into, raising, their, offspring, 9, months, of, carrying, offspring, breast, feeding, etc, should, be, more, choosy, when, it, comes, to, mate, selection, and, should, therefore, desire, long, term, monogamous, relationships, that, would, ensure, the, viability, of, their, offspring, men, on, the, other, hand, have, less, parental, investment, and, so, they, are, driven, towards, indiscriminate, sexual, activity, with, multiple, partners, as, such, activity, increases, the, likelihood, of, their, reproduction, this, theory, says, that, it, is, these, evolutionary, pressures, that, act, on, men, and, women, differentially, and, what, ultimately, drives, more, men, to, seek, sexual, activity, outside, of, their, own, relationships, it, can, however, still, account, for, the, occurrence, of, extradyadic, sexual, relationships, among, women, for, example, a, woman, whose, husband, has, fertilization, difficulties, can, benefit, from, engaging, in, sexual, activity, outside, of, her, relationship, she, can, gain, access, to, high, quality, genes, and, still, derive, the, benefit, of, parental, investment, from, her, husband, or, partner, who, is, unknowingly, investing, in, their, illegitimate, child, evidence, for, the, development, of, such, a, short, term, mating, strategy, in, women, comes, from, findings, that, women, who, engage, in, affairs, typically, do, so, with, men, who, are, of, higher, status, dominance, physical, attractiveness, which, is, indicative, of, genetic, quality, one, defense, mechanism, that, some, researchers, believe, is, effective, at, preventing, infidelity, is, jealousy, jealousy, is, an, emotion, that, can, elicit, strong, responses, cases, have, been, commonly, documented, where, sexual, jealousy, was, a, direct, cause, of, murders, and, morbid, jealousy, buss, 2005, states, that, jealousy, has, three, main, functions, to, help, prevent, infidelity, these, suggestions, are, looking, at, jealousy, s, physiological, mechanism, offers, support, for, this, idea, jealousy, is, a, form, of, stress, response, which, has, been, shown, to, activate, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, by, increasing, heart, rate, blood, pressure, and, respiration, this, will, activate, the, fight, or, flight, response, to, ensure, action, against, the, attempt, at, sexual, infidelity, in, their, partner, buss, and, his, colleagues, were, the, first, to, pioneer, a, theory, that, jealousy, is, an, evolved, human, emotion, that, has, become, an, innate, module, hard, wired, to, prevent, infidelity, from, occurring, this, idea, is, commonly, referred, to, as, jealousy, as, a, specific, innate, module, and, has, become, widely, debated, the, basis, behind, this, argument, is, that, jealousy, was, beneficial, in, our, ancestor, s, time, when, cuckoldry, was, more, common, they, suggested, that, those, who, were, equipped, with, this, emotional, response, could, more, effectively, stop, infidelity, and, those, without, the, emotional, response, had, a, harder, time, doing, so, because, infidelity, imposed, such, a, fitness, cost, those, who, had, the, jealous, emotional, response, improved, their, fitness, and, could, pass, down, the, jealousy, module, to, the, next, generation, another, defense, mechanism, for, preventing, infidelity, is, by, social, monitoring, and, acting, on, any, violation, of, expectations, researchers, in, favor, of, this, defense, mechanism, speculate, that, in, our, ancestor, s, times, the, act, of, sex, or, emotional, infidelity, is, what, triggered, jealousy, and, therefore, the, signal, detection, would, have, happened, only, after, infidelity, had, occurred, making, jealousy, an, emotional, by, product, with, no, selective, function, in, line, with, this, reasoning, these, researchers, hypothesize, that, as, a, person, monitors, their, partner, s, actions, with, a, potential, rival, through, primary, and, secondary, appraisals, if, their, expectations, are, violated, at, either, level, of, observation, they, will, become, distressed, and, enact, an, appropriate, action, to, stop, the, chance, of, infidelity, social, monitoring, therefore, enables, them, to, act, accordingly, before, infidelity, occurs, thereby, having, the, capability, to, raise, their, fitness, research, testing, this, theory, has, found, more, favor, for, the, sexual, jealousy, hypothesis, a, more, recently, suggested, defense, mechanism, of, infidelity, attracting, more, attention, is, that, a, particular, social, group, will, punish, cheaters, by, damaging, their, reputation, the, basis, for, this, suggestion, stems, from, the, fact, that, humans, have, an, unmatched, ability, to, monitor, social, relationships, and, inflict, punishment, on, cheaters, regardless, of, the, context, this, punishment, comes, in, many, forms, one, of, which, is, gossip, this, damage, will, impair, the, future, benefits, that, individual, can, confer, from, the, group, and, its, individuals, a, damaged, reputation, is, especially, debilitating, when, related, to, sexual, and, emotional, infidelity, because, it, can, limit, future, reproductive, mate, choices, within, the, group, and, will, cause, a, net, fitness, cost, that, outweighs, the, fitness, benefit, gained, from, the, infidelity, such, limitations, and, costs, deter, an, individual, from, cheating, in, the, first, place, support, for, this, defense, mechanism, comes, from, fieldwork, by, hirsch, and, his, colleagues, 2007, that, found, that, gossip, about, extramarital, affairs, in, a, small, community, in, mexico, was, particularly, prevalent, and, devastating, for, reputation, in, this, region, specifically, adultery, was, found, to, cause, an, individual, to, be, disowned, by, their, family, decrease, the, marriage, value, of, his, her, family, cause, an, individual, to, lose, money, or, a, job, and, diminish, future, reproductive, potential, in, this, community, men, having, extramarital, affairs, did, so, in, private, areas, with, lower, prevalence, of, women, connected, to, the, community, such, as, bars, and, brothels, both, areas, of, which, had, a, high, risk, of, contracting, sexually, transmitted, infections, the, proliferation, of, sex, chat, rooms, and, dating, apps, has, increased, the, opportunity, for, people, in, committed, relationships, to, engage, in, acts, of, infidelity, on, and, off, the, internet, a, cyber, affair, is, defined, as, a, romantic, or, sexual, relationship, initiated, by, online, contact, and, maintained, primarily, via, online, communication, sexual, acts, online, include, behaviors, such, as, cybersex, where, two, or, more, individuals, engage, in, discussions, about, sexual, fantasies, over, the, internet, and, is, usually, accompanied, by, masturbation, hot, chatting, where, discussions, between, two, or, more, people, move, away, from, light, hearted, flirting, and, emotional, acts, where, people, disclose, intimate, information, to, a, significant, other, a, new, type, of, sexual, activity, online, is, when, two, people, s, avatars, engage, in, sexual, activity, in, virtual, reality, worlds, such, as, second, life, the, majority, of, americans, believe, that, if, a, partner, engaged, in, cybersex, this, constitutes, as, an, act, of, infidelity, a, 2005, survey, of, 1828, participants, reported, one, third, of, them, reported, engaging, in, cybersex, and, of, that, one, third, 46, said, they, were, in, a, committed, relationship, with, someone, else, in, an, attempt, to, differentiate, offline, and, online, infidelity, cooper, morahan, martin, mathy, and, maheu, constructed, a, triple, a, engine, which, identifies, the, three, aspects, of, internet, infidelity, that, distinguish, it, to, some, degree, from, traditional, infidelity, in, a, study, of, 335, dutch, undergraduate, students, involved, in, serious, intimate, relationships, participants, were, presented, with, four, dilemmas, concerning, a, partner, s, emotional, and, sexual, infidelity, over, the, internet, they, found, a, significant, sex, difference, as, to, whether, participants, chose, sexual, and, emotional, infidelity, as, more, upsetting, more, men, than, women, indicated, that, a, partner, s, sexual, involvement, would, upset, them, more, than, a, partner, s, emotional, bonding, with, someone, else, similarly, in, the, dilemma, involving, infidelity, over, the, internet, more, men, indicated, their, partner, s, sexual, involvement, would, upset, them, more, than, a, partner, s, emotional, bonding, with, someone, else, women, on, the, other, hand, expressed, more, problems, with, emotional, infidelity, over, the, internet, than, did, men, online, infidelity, can, be, just, as, damaging, to, a, relationship, as, offline, physical, unfaithfulness, a, possible, explanation, is, that, our, brain, registers, virtual, and, physical, acts, the, same, way, and, responds, similarly, several, studies, have, concluded, that, online, infidelity, whether, sexual, or, emotional, in, nature, often, leads, to, off, line, infidelity, a, study, by, beatriz, lia, avila, mileham, in, 2004, examined, the, phenomenon, of, online, infidelity, in, chat, rooms, the, following, factors, were, investigated, what, elements, and, dynamics, online, infidelity, involves, and, how, it, happens, what, leads, individuals, specifically, to, the, computer, to, search, for, a, relationship, on, the, side, whether, individuals, consider, online, contacts, as, infidelity, and, why, or, why, not, and, what, dynamics, chat, room, users, experience, in, their, marriages, the, results, led, to, three, constructs, that, symbolize, chat, room, dynamics, and, serve, as, a, foundation, for, internet, infidelity, all, countries, in, europe, as, well, as, most, countries, in, latin, america, have, decriminalized, adultery, however, in, many, countries, in, africa, and, asia, particularly, the, middle, east, this, type, of, infidelity, is, criminalized, even, where, infidelity, is, not, a, criminal, offense, it, may, have, legal, implications, in, divorce, cases, for, example, it, may, be, a, factor, in, property, settlement, the, custody, of, children, the, denial, of, alimony, etc, in, civil, claims, not, only, the, spouse, but, also, the, other, man, other, woman, may, be, held, accountable, for, example, seven, us, states, hawaii, illinois, north, carolina, mississippi, new, mexico, south, dakota, and, utah, allow, the, possibility, of, the, tort, action, of, alienation, of, affections, brought, by, a, deserted, spouse, against, a, third, party, alleged, to, be, responsible, for, the, failure, of, the, marriage, in, a, highly, publicized, case, in, 2010, a, woman, in, north, carolina, won, a, 9, million, suit, against, her, husband, s, mistress, in, the, united, states, criminal, laws, relating, to, infidelity, vary, and, those, states, that, criminalize, adultery, rarely, prosecute, the, offense, penalties, for, adultery, range, from, life, imprisonment, in, michigan, to, a, 10, fine, in, maryland, or, class, 1, felony, in, wisconsin, the, constitutionality, of, us, criminal, laws, on, adultery, is, unclear, due, to, supreme, court, decisions, in, 1965, giving, privacy, of, sexual, intimacy, to, consenting, adults, as, well, as, broader, implications, of, lawrence, v, texas, 2003, adultery, is, declared, to, be, illegal, in, 21, states, in, many, jurisdictions, adultery, may, have, indirect, legal, implications, particularly, in, cases, of, infliction, of, violence, such, as, domestic, assaults, and, killings, in, particular, by, mitigating, murder, to, manslaughter, or, otherwise, providing, for, partial, or, complete, defenses, in, case, of, violence, especially, in, cultures, where, there, is, a, traditional, toleration, of, crimes, of, passion, and, honor, killings, such, provisions, have, been, condemned, by, the, council, of, europe, and, the, united, nations, in, recent, years, the, council, of, europe, recommendation, rec, 2002, 5, of, the, committee, of, ministers, to, member, states, on, the, protection, of, women, against, violence, states, that, member, states, should, 57, preclude, adultery, as, an, excuse, for, violence, within, the, family, un, women, has, also, stated, in, regard, to, the, defense, of, provocation, and, other, similar, defenses, laws, should, clearly, state, that, these, defenses, do, not, include, or, apply, to, crimes, of, honour, adultery, or, domestic, assault, or, murder, as, the, number, of, women, in, the, workforce, increases, to, match, that, of, men, researchers, expect, the, likelihood, of, infidelity, will, also, increase, with, workplace, interactions, wiggins, and, lederer, 1984, found, that, opportunities, to, engage, in, infidelity, were, related, to, the, workplace, where, nearly, one, half, of, their, samples, who, engaged, in, infidelity, were, involved, with, coworkers, a, study, done, by, mckinnish, 2007, found, that, those, who, work, with, a, larger, fraction, of, workers, of, the, opposite, sex, are, more, likely, to, be, divorced, due, to, infidelity, kuroki, found, that, married, women, were, less, likely, to, have, a, workplace, affair, whereas, self, employed, individuals, are, more, likely, in, 2000, treas, and, giesen, found, similar, results, where, sexual, opportunities, in, the, workplace, increased, the, likelihood, of, infidelity, during, the, last, 12, months, adulterous, office, romances, are, widely, considered, to, be, unhelpful, to, business, and, work, relationships, and, superior, subordinate, relationships, are, banned, in, 90, of, companies, with, written, policies, regarding, office, romance, companies, cannot, ban, adultery, as, in, all, but, a, handful, of, states, such, regulations, would, run, afoul, of, laws, prohibiting, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, marital, status, firings, nonetheless, often, occur, on, the, basis, of, charges, of, inappropriate, office, conduct, academics, and, therapists, say, cheating, is, probably, more, prevalent, on, the, road, than, close, to, home, the, protection, of, the, road, offers, a, secret, life, of, romance, far, from, spouses, or, partners, affairs, range, from, one, night, stands, to, relationships, that, last, for, years, they, are, usually, with, a, co, worker, a, business, associate, or, someone, they, repeatedly, encounter, another, reason, for, the, development, of, office, romances, is, the, amount, of, time, co, workers, spend, together, spouses, today, often, spend, more, time, with, co, workers, in, the, office, than, with, each, other, a, newsweek, article, notes, nearly, 60, percent, of, american, women, work, outside, the, home, up, from, about, 40, percent, in, 1964, quite, simply, women, intersect, with, more, people, during, the, day, than, they, used, to, they, go, to, more, meetings, take, more, business, trips, and, presumably, participate, more, in, flirtatious, water, cooler, chatter, according, to, debra, laino, in, an, article, for, shave, some, of, the, reasons, women, cheat, at, the, workplace, are, because, women, are, disproportionately, exposed, to, men, in, the, workplace, and, as, a, direct, consequence, many, have, more, options, and, chances, to, cheat, swinging, is, a, form, of, extradyadic, sex, where, married, couples, exchange, partners, with, each, other, swinging, was, originally, called, wife, swapping, but, due, to, the, sexist, connotations, and, the, fact, that, many, wives, were, willing, to, swap, partners, mate, swapping, and, or, swinging, was, substituted, the, supreme, court, of, canada, has, ruled, swinging, is, legal, as, long, as, it, takes, place, in, a, private, place, and, is, consensual, swinging, can, be, closed, or, open, where, couples, meet, and, each, pair, goes, off, to, a, separate, room, or, they, have, sex, in, the, same, room, the, majority, of, swingers, fall, into, the, middle, and, upper, classes, with, an, above, average, education, and, income, and, majority, of, these, swingers, are, white, 90, a, study, done, by, jenks, in, 1986, found, that, swingers, are, not, significantly, different, from, non, swingers, on, measures, such, as, philosophy, authoritarianism, self, respect, happiness, freedom, equality, etc, swingers, tend, to, emphasize, personal, values, over, more, social, ones, according, to, henshel, 1973, the, initiation, into, the, world, of, swinging, usually, is, done, by, the, husband, reasons, for, getting, involved, in, swinging, are, the, variety, of, sexual, partners, and, experiences, pleasure, or, excitement, meeting, new, people, and, voyeurism, in, order, for, swinging, to, work, both, partners, need, to, have, a, liberal, sexual, predisposition, and, a, low, degree, of, jealousy, gilmartin, 1975, found, that, 85, of, his, sample, of, swingers, felt, that, these, sexual, encounters, posed, no, real, threat, to, their, marriage, and, felt, it, had, improved, jenks, 1998, found, no, reason, to, believe, that, swinging, was, detrimental, to, marriage, with, over, 91, of, males, and, 82, of, females, indicating, they, were, happy, with, swinging, another, form, of, extradyadic, sex, is, polyamory, a, non, possessive, honest, responsible, and, ethical, philosophy, and, practice, of, loving, multiple, people, simultaneously, there, are, various, types, of, relationships, in, polyamory, such, as, intentional, family, group, relationship, and, group, marriage, one, type, of, group, relationship, can, be, a, triad, involving, a, married, couple, and, an, additional, person, who, all, share, sexual, intimacy, however, it, is, usually, an, addition, of, a, female, unlike, polygyny, or, polyandry, both, men, and, women, may, have, multiple, partners, within, the, confines, of, polyamory, polyamorous, relationships, are, distinguished, from, extramarital, affairs, by, the, full, disclosure, and, consent, of, all, involved, polyamorous, relationships, may, specify, unique, boundaries, outside, monogamous, expectations, of, fidelity, that, if, violated, are, still, considered, cheating, because, both, men, and, women, can, have, multiple, partners, these, individuals, do, not, consider, themselves, to, be, either, uncommitted, or, unfaithful
