https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube
the, rubik, s, cube, is, a, 3d, combination, puzzle, invented, in, 1974, by, hungarian, sculptor, and, professor, of, architecture, ern, rubik, originally, called, the, magic, cube, the, puzzle, was, licensed, by, rubik, to, be, sold, by, pentangle, puzzles, in, the, uk, in, 1978, and, then, by, ideal, toy, corp, in, 1980, via, businessman, tibor, laczi, and, seven, towns, founder, tom, kremer, the, cube, was, released, internationally, in, 1980, and, became, one, of, the, most, recognized, icons, in, popular, culture, it, won, the, 1980, german, game, of, the, year, special, award, for, best, puzzle, as, of, january, 2024, around, 500, million, cubes, had, been, sold, worldwide, making, it, the, world, s, bestselling, puzzle, game, and, bestselling, toy, the, rubik, s, cube, was, inducted, into, the, us, national, toy, hall, of, fame, in, 2014, on, the, original, classic, rubik, s, cube, each, of, the, six, faces, was, covered, by, nine, stickers, with, each, face, in, one, of, six, solid, colours, white, red, blue, orange, green, and, yellow, some, later, versions, of, the, cube, have, been, updated, to, use, coloured, plastic, panels, instead, which, unlike, the, stickers, don, t, peel, or, fade, since, 1988, the, arrangement, of, colours, has, been, standardised, with, white, opposite, yellow, blue, opposite, green, and, orange, opposite, red, and, with, the, red, white, and, blue, arranged, clockwise, in, that, order, on, early, cubes, the, position, of, the, colours, varied, from, cube, to, cube, an, internal, pivot, mechanism, enables, each, face, to, turn, independently, thus, mixing, up, the, colours, for, the, puzzle, to, be, solved, each, face, must, be, returned, to, having, only, one, colour, the, cube, has, inspired, other, designers, to, create, a, number, of, similar, puzzles, with, various, numbers, of, sides, dimensions, and, mechanisms, although, the, rubik, s, cube, reached, the, height, of, its, mainstream, popularity, in, the, 1980s, it, is, still, widely, known, and, used, many, speedcubers, continue, to, practice, it, and, similar, puzzles, and, to, compete, for, the, fastest, times, in, various, categories, since, 2003, the, world, cube, association, wca, the, international, governing, body, of, the, rubik, s, cube, has, organised, competitions, worldwide, and, has, recognised, world, records, in, march, 1970, larry, d, nichols, invented, a, 2x2x2, puzzle, with, pieces, rotatable, in, groups, and, filed, a, canadian, patent, application, for, it, nichols, s, cube, was, held, together, by, magnets, nichols, was, granted, u, s, patent, 3, 655, 201, on, 11, april, 1972, two, years, before, rubik, invented, his, cube, on, 9, april, 1970, frank, fox, applied, to, patent, an, amusement, device, a, type, of, sliding, puzzle, on, a, spherical, surface, with, at, least, two, 3, 3, arrays, intended, to, be, used, for, the, game, of, noughts, and, crosses, he, received, his, uk, patent, 1344259, on, 16, january, 1974, in, the, mid, 1970s, ern, rubik, worked, at, the, department, of, interior, design, at, the, academy, of, applied, arts, and, crafts, in, budapest, although, it, is, widely, reported, that, the, cube, was, built, as, a, teaching, tool, to, help, his, students, understand, 3d, objects, his, actual, purpose, was, solving, the, structural, problem, of, moving, the, parts, independently, without, the, entire, mechanism, falling, apart, he, did, not, realise, that, he, had, created, a, puzzle, until, the, first, time, he, scrambled, his, new, cube, and, then, tried, to, restore, it, rubik, applied, for, a, patent, in, hungary, for, his, magic, cube, hungarian, b, v, s, kocka, on, 30, january, 1975, and, hu170062, was, granted, later, that, year, the, first, test, batches, of, the, magic, cube, were, produced, in, late, 1977, and, released, in, budapest, toy, shops, magic, cube, was, held, together, with, interlocking, plastic, pieces, that, prevented, the, puzzle, from, being, easily, pulled, apart, unlike, the, magnets, in, nichols, s, design, with, ern, rubik, s, permission, businessman, tibor, laczi, took, a, cube, to, germany, s, nuremberg, toy, fair, in, february, 1979, in, an, attempt, to, popularise, it, it, was, noticed, by, seven, towns, founder, tom, kremer, and, they, signed, a, deal, with, ideal, toys, in, september, 1979, to, release, the, magic, cube, worldwide, ideal, wanted, at, least, a, recognisable, name, to, trademark, that, arrangement, put, rubik, in, the, spotlight, because, the, magic, cube, was, renamed, after, its, inventor, in, 1980, the, puzzle, made, its, international, debut, at, the, toy, fairs, of, london, paris, nuremberg, and, new, york, in, january, and, february, 1980, after, its, international, debut, the, progress, of, the, cube, towards, the, toy, shop, shelves, of, the, west, was, briefly, halted, so, that, it, could, be, manufactured, to, western, safety, and, packaging, specifications, a, lighter, cube, was, produced, and, ideal, decided, to, rename, it, the, gordian, knot, and, inca, gold, were, considered, but, the, company, finally, decided, on, rubik, s, cube, and, the, first, batch, was, exported, from, hungary, in, may, 1980, the, packaging, had, a, few, variations, depending, on, the, country, most, popular, being, a, clear, plastic, cylinder, but, cardboard, versions, were, also, used, the, cube, itself, had, slightly, different, variations, in, the, order, of, the, colours, western, vs, japanese, colour, scheme, where, blue, yellow, are, switched, and, some, of, the, cubes, did, not, have, a, white, piece, logo, after, the, first, batches, of, rubik, s, cubes, were, released, in, may, 1980, initial, sales, were, modest, but, ideal, began, a, television, advertising, campaign, in, the, middle, of, the, year, which, it, supplemented, with, newspaper, advertisements, at, the, end, of, 1980, rubik, s, cube, won, a, german, game, of, the, year, special, award, and, won, similar, awards, for, best, toy, in, the, uk, france, and, the, us, by, 1981, rubik, s, cube, had, become, a, craze, and, it, is, estimated, that, in, the, period, from, 1980, to, 1983, around, 200, million, rubik, s, cubes, were, sold, worldwide, in, march, 1981, a, speedcubing, championship, organised, by, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, was, held, in, munich, and, a, rubik, s, cube, was, depicted, on, the, front, cover, of, scientific, american, that, same, month, in, june, 1981, the, washington, post, reported, that, rubik, s, cube, is, a, puzzle, that, s, moving, like, fast, food, right, now, this, year, s, hoola, hoop, or, bongo, board, and, by, september, 1981, new, scientist, noted, that, the, cube, had, captivated, the, attention, of, children, of, ages, from, 7, to, 70, all, over, the, world, this, summer, as, most, people, could, solve, only, one, or, two, sides, numerous, books, were, published, including, david, singmaster, s, notes, on, rubik, s, magic, cube, 1980, and, patrick, bossert, s, you, can, do, the, cube, 1981, at, one, stage, in, 1981, three, of, the, top, ten, best, selling, books, in, the, us, were, books, on, solving, rubik, s, cube, and, the, best, selling, book, of, 1981, was, james, g, nourse, s, the, simple, solution, to, rubik, s, cube, which, sold, over, 6, million, copies, in, 1981, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, exhibited, a, rubik, s, cube, and, at, the, 1982, world, s, fair, in, knoxville, tennessee, a, six, foot, cube, was, put, on, display, abc, television, even, developed, a, cartoon, show, called, rubik, the, amazing, cube, in, june, 1982, the, first, rubik, s, cube, world, championship, took, place, in, budapest, and, would, become, the, only, competition, recognized, as, official, until, the, championship, was, revived, in, 2003, in, october, 1982, the, new, york, times, reported, that, sales, had, fallen, and, that, the, craze, has, died, and, by, 1983, it, was, clear, that, sales, had, plummeted, however, in, some, countries, such, as, china, and, the, ussr, the, craze, had, started, later, and, demand, was, still, high, because, of, a, shortage, of, cubes, rubik, s, cubes, continued, to, be, marketed, and, sold, throughout, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, but, it, was, not, until, the, early, 2000s, that, interest, in, the, cube, began, increasing, again, in, the, us, sales, doubled, between, 2001, and, 2003, and, the, boston, globe, remarked, that, it, was, becoming, cool, to, own, a, cube, again, the, 2003, world, rubik, s, games, championship, was, the, first, speedcubing, tournament, since, 1982, it, was, held, in, toronto, and, was, attended, by, 83, participants, the, tournament, led, to, the, formation, of, the, world, cube, association, in, 2004, annual, sales, of, rubik, branded, cubes, were, said, to, have, reached, 15, million, worldwide, in, 2008, part, of, the, new, appeal, was, ascribed, to, the, advent, of, internet, video, sites, such, as, youtube, which, allowed, fans, to, share, their, solving, strategies, following, the, expiration, of, rubik, s, patent, in, 2000, other, brands, of, cubes, appeared, especially, from, chinese, companies, many, of, these, chinese, branded, cubes, have, been, engineered, for, speed, and, are, favoured, by, speedcubers, on, 27, october, 2020, spin, master, said, it, will, pay, 50, million, to, buy, the, rubik, s, cube, brand, taking, advantage, of, an, initial, shortage, of, cubes, many, imitations, and, variations, appeared, many, of, which, may, have, violated, one, or, more, patents, in, 2000, the, patents, expired, and, since, then, many, chinese, companies, have, produced, copies, modifications, and, improvements, upon, the, rubik, and, v, cube, designs, nichols, assigned, his, patent, to, his, employer, moleculon, research, corp, which, sued, ideal, in, 1982, in, 1984, ideal, lost, the, patent, infringement, suit, and, appealed, in, 1986, the, appeals, court, affirmed, the, judgment, that, rubik, s, 2, 2, 2, pocket, cube, infringed, nichols, s, patent, but, overturned, the, judgment, on, rubik, s, 3, 3, 3, cube, even, while, rubik, s, patent, application, was, being, processed, terutoshi, ishigi, a, self, taught, engineer, and, ironworks, owner, near, tokyo, filed, for, a, japanese, patent, for, a, nearly, identical, mechanism, which, was, granted, in, 1976, japanese, patent, publication, jp55, 008192, until, 1999, when, an, amended, japanese, patent, law, was, enforced, japan, s, patent, office, granted, japanese, patents, for, non, disclosed, technology, within, japan, without, requiring, worldwide, novelty, hence, ishigi, s, patent, is, generally, accepted, as, an, independent, reinvention, at, that, time, rubik, applied, for, more, patents, in, 1980, including, another, hungarian, patent, on, 28, october, in, the, united, states, rubik, was, granted, u, s, patent, 4, 378, 116, on, 29, march, 1983, for, the, cube, this, patent, expired, in, 2000, rubik, s, brand, ltd, also, holds, the, registered, trademarks, for, the, word, rubik, and, rubik, s, and, for, the, 2d, and, 3d, visualisations, of, the, puzzle, the, trademarks, were, upheld, by, a, ruling, of, the, general, court, of, the, european, union, on, 25, november, 2014, in, a, successful, defence, against, a, german, toy, manufacturer, seeking, to, invalidate, them, however, european, toy, manufacturers, are, allowed, to, create, differently, shaped, puzzles, that, have, a, similar, rotating, or, twisting, functionality, of, component, parts, such, as, for, example, skewb, pyraminx, or, impossiball, on, 10, november, 2016, rubik, s, cube, lost, a, ten, year, battle, over, a, key, trademark, issue, the, european, union, s, highest, court, the, court, of, justice, ruled, that, the, puzzle, s, shape, was, not, sufficient, to, grant, it, trademark, protection, a, standard, rubik, s, cube, measures, 5, 6, centimetres, 2, 1, 4, in, on, each, side, the, puzzle, consists, of, 26, unique, miniature, cubes, also, known, as, cubies, or, cubelets, each, of, these, includes, a, concealed, inward, extension, that, interlocks, with, the, other, cubes, while, permitting, them, to, move, to, different, locations, however, the, centre, cube, of, each, of, the, six, faces, is, merely, a, single, square, fa, ade, all, six, are, affixed, to, the, core, mechanism, these, provide, structure, for, the, other, pieces, to, fit, into, and, rotate, around, hence, there, are, 21, pieces, a, single, core, piece, consisting, of, three, intersecting, axes, holding, the, six, centre, squares, in, place, but, letting, them, rotate, and, 20, smaller, plastic, pieces, that, fit, into, it, to, form, the, assembled, puzzle, each, of, the, six, centre, pieces, pivots, on, a, fastener, held, by, the, centre, piece, a, 3d, cross, a, spring, between, each, fastener, and, its, corresponding, piece, tensions, the, piece, inward, so, that, collectively, the, whole, assembly, remains, compact, but, can, still, be, easily, manipulated, the, older, versions, of, the, official, cube, used, a, screw, that, can, be, tightened, or, loosened, to, change, the, feel, of, the, cube, newer, official, rubik, s, brand, cubes, have, rivets, instead, of, screws, and, cannot, be, adjusted, inexpensive, clones, do, not, have, screws, or, springs, all, they, have, is, a, plastic, clip, to, keep, the, centre, piece, in, place, and, freely, rotate, the, cube, can, be, taken, apart, without, much, difficulty, typically, by, rotating, the, top, layer, by, 45, and, then, prying, one, of, its, edge, cubes, away, from, the, other, two, layers, consequently, it, is, a, simple, process, to, solve, a, cube, by, taking, it, apart, and, reassembling, it, in, a, solved, state, there, are, six, central, pieces, that, show, one, coloured, face, twelve, edge, pieces, that, show, two, coloured, faces, and, eight, corner, pieces, that, show, three, coloured, faces, each, piece, shows, a, unique, colour, combination, but, not, all, combinations, are, present, for, example, if, red, and, orange, are, on, opposite, sides, of, the, solved, cube, there, is, no, edge, piece, with, both, red, and, orange, sides, the, location, of, these, cubes, relative, to, one, another, can, be, altered, by, twisting, an, outer, third, of, the, cube, by, increments, of, 90, degrees, but, the, location, of, the, coloured, sides, relative, to, one, another, in, the, completed, state, of, the, puzzle, cannot, be, altered, it, is, fixed, by, the, relative, positions, of, the, centre, squares, however, cubes, with, alternative, colour, arrangements, also, exist, for, example, with, the, yellow, face, opposite, the, green, the, blue, face, opposite, the, white, and, red, and, orange, remaining, opposite, each, other, douglas, hofstadter, in, the, july, 1982, issue, of, scientific, american, pointed, out, that, cubes, could, be, coloured, in, such, a, way, as, to, emphasise, the, corners, or, edges, rather, than, the, faces, as, the, standard, colouring, does, but, neither, of, these, alternative, colourings, has, ever, become, popular, the, puzzle, was, originally, advertised, as, having, over, 3, 000, 000, 000, three, billion, combinations, but, only, one, solution, depending, on, how, combinations, are, counted, the, actual, number, is, significantly, higher, the, original, 3, 3, 3, rubik, s, cube, has, eight, corners, and, twelve, edges, there, are, 8, 40, 320, ways, to, arrange, the, corner, cubes, each, corner, has, three, possible, orientations, although, only, seven, of, eight, can, be, oriented, independently, the, orientation, of, the, eighth, final, corner, depends, on, the, preceding, seven, giving, 3, 7, 2, 187, possibilities, there, are, 12, 2, 239, 500, 800, ways, to, arrange, the, edges, restricted, from, 12, because, edges, must, be, in, an, even, permutation, exactly, when, the, corners, are, when, arrangements, of, centres, are, also, permitted, as, described, below, the, rule, is, that, the, combined, arrangement, of, corners, edges, and, centres, must, be, an, even, permutation, eleven, edges, can, be, flipped, independently, with, the, flip, of, the, twelfth, depending, on, the, preceding, ones, giving, 2, 11, 2, 048, possibilities, which, is, approximately, 43, quintillion, to, put, this, into, perspective, if, one, had, one, standard, sized, rubik, s, cube, for, each, permutation, one, could, cover, the, earth, s, surface, 275, times, or, stack, them, in, a, tower, 261, light, years, high, the, preceding, figure, is, limited, to, permutations, that, can, be, reached, solely, by, turning, the, sides, of, the, cube, if, one, considers, permutations, reached, through, disassembly, of, the, cube, the, number, becomes, twelve, times, larger, which, is, approximately, 519, quintillion, possible, arrangements, of, the, pieces, that, make, up, the, cube, but, only, one, twelfth, of, these, are, actually, solvable, this, is, because, there, is, no, sequence, of, moves, that, will, swap, a, single, pair, of, pieces, or, rotate, a, single, corner, or, edge, cube, thus, there, are, 12, possible, sets, of, reachable, configurations, sometimes, called, universes, or, orbits, into, which, the, cube, can, be, placed, by, dismantling, and, reassembling, it, the, preceding, numbers, assume, the, centre, faces, are, in, a, fixed, position, if, one, considers, turning, the, whole, cube, to, be, a, different, permutation, then, each, of, the, preceding, numbers, should, be, multiplied, by, 24, a, chosen, colour, can, be, on, one, of, six, sides, and, then, one, of, the, adjacent, colours, can, be, in, one, of, four, positions, this, determines, the, positions, of, all, remaining, colours, the, original, rubik, s, cube, had, no, orientation, markings, on, the, centre, faces, although, some, carried, the, rubik, s, cube, mark, on, the, centre, square, of, the, white, face, and, therefore, solving, it, does, not, require, any, attention, to, orienting, those, faces, correctly, however, with, marker, pens, one, could, for, example, mark, the, central, squares, of, an, unscrambled, cube, with, four, coloured, marks, on, each, edge, each, corresponding, to, the, colour, of, the, adjacent, face, a, cube, marked, in, this, way, is, referred, to, as, a, supercube, some, cubes, have, also, been, produced, commercially, with, markings, on, all, of, the, squares, such, as, the, lo, shu, magic, square, or, playing, card, suits, cubes, have, also, been, produced, where, the, nine, stickers, on, a, face, are, used, to, make, a, single, larger, picture, and, centre, orientation, matters, on, these, as, well, thus, one, can, nominally, solve, a, cube, yet, have, the, markings, on, the, centres, rotated, it, then, becomes, an, additional, test, to, solve, the, centres, as, well, marking, rubik, s, cube, s, centres, increases, its, difficulty, because, this, expands, the, set, of, distinguishable, possible, configurations, there, are, 4, 6, 2, 2, 048, ways, to, orient, the, centres, since, an, even, permutation, of, the, corners, implies, an, even, number, of, quarter, turns, of, centres, as, well, in, particular, when, the, cube, is, unscrambled, apart, from, the, orientations, of, the, central, squares, there, will, always, be, an, even, number, of, centre, squares, requiring, a, quarter, turn, thus, orientations, of, centres, increases, the, total, number, of, possible, cube, permutations, from, 43, 252, 003, 274, 489, 856, 000, 4, 3, 10, 19, to, 88, 580, 102, 706, 155, 225, 088, 000, 8, 9, 10, 22, when, turning, a, cube, over, is, considered, to, be, a, change, in, permutation, then, we, must, also, count, arrangements, of, the, centre, faces, nominally, there, are, 6, ways, to, arrange, the, six, centre, faces, of, the, cube, but, only, 24, of, these, are, achievable, without, disassembly, of, the, cube, when, the, orientations, of, centres, are, also, counted, as, above, this, increases, the, total, number, of, possible, cube, permutations, from, 88, 580, 102, 706, 155, 225, 088, 000, 8, 9, 10, 22, to, 2, 125, 922, 464, 947, 725, 402, 112, 000, 2, 1, 10, 24, in, rubik, s, cubers, parlance, a, memorised, sequence, of, moves, that, have, a, desired, effect, on, the, cube, is, called, an, algorithm, this, terminology, is, derived, from, the, mathematical, use, of, algorithm, meaning, a, list, of, well, defined, instructions, for, performing, a, task, from, a, given, initial, state, through, well, defined, successive, states, to, a, desired, end, state, each, method, of, solving, the, cube, employs, its, own, set, of, algorithms, together, with, descriptions, of, what, effect, the, algorithm, has, and, when, it, can, be, used, to, bring, the, cube, closer, to, being, solved, many, algorithms, are, designed, to, transform, only, a, small, part, of, the, cube, without, interfering, with, other, parts, that, have, already, been, solved, so, that, they, can, be, applied, repeatedly, to, different, parts, of, the, cube, until, the, whole, is, solved, for, example, there, are, well, known, algorithms, for, cycling, three, corners, without, changing, the, rest, of, the, puzzle, or, flipping, the, orientation, of, a, pair, of, edges, while, leaving, the, others, intact, some, algorithms, do, have, a, certain, desired, effect, on, the, cube, for, example, swapping, two, corners, but, may, also, have, the, side, effect, of, changing, other, parts, of, the, cube, such, as, permuting, some, edges, such, algorithms, are, often, simpler, than, the, ones, without, side, effects, and, are, employed, early, on, in, the, solution, when, most, of, the, puzzle, has, not, yet, been, solved, and, the, side, effects, are, not, important, towards, the, end, of, the, solution, the, more, specific, and, usually, more, complicated, algorithms, are, used, instead, rubik, s, cube, lends, itself, to, the, application, of, mathematical, group, theory, which, has, been, helpful, for, deducing, certain, algorithms, in, particular, those, which, have, a, commutator, structure, namely, xyx, 1, y, 1, where, x, and, y, are, specific, moves, or, move, sequences, and, x, 1, and, y, 1, are, their, respective, inverses, or, a, conjugate, structure, namely, xyx, 1, often, referred, to, by, speedcubers, colloquially, as, a, setup, move, in, addition, the, fact, that, there, are, well, defined, subgroups, within, the, rubik, s, cube, group, enables, the, puzzle, to, be, learned, and, mastered, by, moving, up, through, various, self, contained, levels, of, difficulty, for, example, one, such, level, could, involve, solving, cubes, that, have, been, scrambled, using, only, 180, degree, turns, these, subgroups, are, the, principle, underlying, the, computer, cubing, methods, by, thistlethwaite, and, kociemba, which, solve, the, cube, by, further, reducing, it, to, another, subgroup, the, rubik, s, group, can, be, endowed, with, a, unitary, representation, such, a, description, allows, the, rubik, s, cube, to, be, mapped, into, a, quantum, system, of, few, particles, where, the, rotations, of, its, faces, are, implemented, by, unitary, operators, the, rotations, of, the, faces, act, as, generators, of, the, lie, group, many, 3, 3, 3, rubik, s, cube, enthusiasts, use, a, notation, developed, by, david, singmaster, to, denote, a, sequence, of, moves, referred, to, as, singmaster, notation, or, simple, cube, notation, its, relative, nature, allows, algorithms, to, be, written, in, such, a, way, that, they, can, be, applied, regardless, of, which, side, is, designated, the, top, or, how, the, colours, are, organised, on, a, particular, cube, when, a, prime, symbol, follows, a, letter, it, indicates, an, anticlockwise, face, turn, while, a, letter, without, a, prime, symbol, denotes, a, clockwise, turn, these, directions, are, as, one, is, looking, at, the, specified, face, a, letter, followed, by, a, 2, occasionally, a, superscript, 2, denotes, two, turns, or, a, 180, degree, turn, for, example, r, means, to, turn, the, right, side, clockwise, but, r, means, to, turn, the, right, side, anticlockwise, the, letters, x, y, and, z, are, used, to, indicate, that, the, entire, cube, should, be, turned, about, one, of, its, axes, corresponding, to, r, u, and, f, turns, respectively, when, x, y, or, z, is, primed, it, is, an, indication, that, the, cube, must, be, rotated, in, the, opposite, direction, when, x, y, or, z, is, squared, the, cube, must, be, rotated, 180, degrees, one, of, the, most, common, deviations, from, singmaster, notation, and, in, fact, the, current, official, standard, is, to, use, w, for, wide, instead, of, lowercase, letters, to, represent, moves, of, two, layers, thus, a, move, of, rw, is, equivalent, to, one, of, r, for, methods, using, middle, layer, turns, particularly, corners, first, methods, there, is, a, generally, accepted, mes, extension, to, the, notation, where, letters, m, e, and, s, denote, middle, layer, turns, it, was, used, e, g, in, marc, waterman, s, algorithm, the, 4, 4, 4, and, larger, cubes, use, an, extended, notation, to, refer, to, the, additional, middle, layers, generally, speaking, uppercase, letters, f, b, u, d, l, r, refer, to, the, outermost, portions, of, the, cube, called, faces, lowercase, letters, f, b, u, d, l, r, refer, to, the, inner, portions, of, the, cube, called, slices, an, asterisk, l, a, number, in, front, of, it, 2l, or, two, layers, in, parentheses, ll, means, to, turn, the, two, layers, at, the, same, time, both, the, inner, and, the, outer, left, faces, for, example, rr, l, 2, f, means, to, turn, the, two, rightmost, layers, anticlockwise, then, the, left, inner, layer, twice, and, then, the, inner, front, layer, anticlockwise, by, extension, for, cubes, of, 6, 6, 6, and, larger, moves, of, three, layers, are, notated, by, the, number, 3, for, example, 3l, an, alternative, notation, wolstenholme, notation, is, designed, to, make, memorising, sequences, of, moves, easier, for, novices, this, notation, uses, the, same, letters, for, faces, except, it, replaces, u, with, t, top, so, that, all, are, consonants, the, key, difference, is, the, use, of, the, vowels, o, a, and, i, for, cl, o, ckwise, a, nticlockwise, and, tw, i, ce, 180, degree, turns, which, results, in, word, like, sequences, such, as, lota, rato, lata, roti, equivalent, to, lu, r, u, l, u, r, u2, in, singmaster, notation, the, addition, of, a, c, implies, rotation, of, the, entire, cube, so, roc, is, the, clockwise, rotation, of, the, cube, around, its, right, face, middle, layer, moves, are, denoted, by, adding, an, m, to, the, corresponding, face, move, so, rim, means, a, 180, degree, turn, of, the, middle, layer, adjacent, to, the, r, face, another, notation, appeared, in, the, 1981, book, the, simple, solution, to, rubik, s, cube, singmaster, notation, was, not, widely, known, at, the, time, of, publication, the, faces, were, named, top, t, bottom, b, left, l, right, r, front, f, and, posterior, p, with, for, clockwise, for, anticlockwise, and, 2, for, 180, degree, turns, another, notation, appeared, in, the, 1982, the, ideal, solution, book, for, rubik, s, revenge, horizontal, planes, were, noted, as, tables, with, table, 1, or, t1, starting, at, the, top, vertical, front, to, back, planes, were, noted, as, books, with, book, 1, or, b1, starting, from, the, left, vertical, left, to, right, planes, were, noted, as, windows, with, window, 1, or, w1, starting, at, the, front, using, the, front, face, as, a, reference, view, table, moves, were, left, or, right, book, moves, were, up, or, down, and, window, moves, were, clockwise, or, anticlockwise, the, repetition, of, any, given, move, sequence, on, a, cube, which, is, initially, in, solved, state, will, eventually, return, the, cube, back, to, its, solved, state, the, smallest, number, of, iterations, required, is, the, period, of, the, sequence, for, example, the, 180, degree, turn, of, any, side, has, period, 2, e, g, u, 2, 2, the, 90, degree, turn, of, any, side, has, period, 4, e, g, r, 4, the, maximum, period, for, a, move, sequence, is, 1260, for, example, allowing, for, full, rotations, f, x, 1260, or, r, y, 1260, or, u, z, 1260, not, allowing, for, rotations, d, r, u, 2, m, 1260, or, b, e, l, f, 2, 1260, or, s, u, b, d, 2, 1260, only, allowing, for, clockwise, quarter, turns, u, r, s, u, l, 1260, or, f, l, e, b, l, 1260, or, r, u, r, d, s, 1260, only, allowing, for, lateral, clockwise, quarter, turns, f, b, l, f, b, r, f, u, 1260, or, u, d, r, u, d, l, u, f, 1260, or, r, l, d, r, l, u, r, f, 1260, although, there, are, a, significant, number, of, possible, permutations, for, rubik, s, cube, a, number, of, solutions, have, been, developed, which, allow, solving, the, cube, in, well, under, 100, moves, many, general, solutions, for, the, cube, have, been, discovered, independently, david, singmaster, first, published, his, solution, in, the, book, notes, on, rubik, s, magic, cube, in, 1981, this, solution, involves, solving, the, cube, layer, by, layer, in, which, one, layer, designated, the, top, is, solved, first, followed, by, the, middle, layer, and, then, the, final, and, bottom, layer, after, sufficient, practice, solving, the, cube, layer, by, layer, can, be, done, in, under, one, minute, other, general, solutions, include, corners, first, methods, or, combinations, of, several, other, methods, in, 1982, david, singmaster, and, alexander, frey, hypothesised, that, the, number, of, moves, needed, to, solve, the, cube, given, an, ideal, algorithm, might, be, in, the, low, twenties, in, 2007, daniel, kunkle, and, gene, cooperman, used, computer, search, methods, to, demonstrate, that, any, 3, 3, 3, rubik, s, cube, configuration, can, be, solved, in, 26, moves, or, fewer, in, 2008, tomas, rokicki, lowered, that, number, to, 22, moves, and, in, july, 2010, a, team, of, researchers, including, rokicki, working, with, computers, provided, by, google, proved, that, the, so, called, god, s, number, for, rubik, s, cube, is, 20, this, means, that, all, initial, configurations, can, be, solved, in, 20, moves, or, less, and, some, in, fact, millions, require, 20, more, generally, it, has, been, shown, that, an, n, n, n, rubik, s, cube, can, be, solved, optimally, in, n, 2, log, n, moves, a, solution, commonly, used, by, speedcubers, was, developed, by, jessica, fridrich, this, method, is, called, cfop, standing, for, cross, f2l, oll, pll, it, is, similar, to, the, layer, by, layer, method, but, employs, the, use, of, a, large, number, of, algorithms, especially, for, orienting, and, permuting, the, last, layer, the, cross, is, solved, first, followed, by, first, layer, corners, and, second, layer, edges, simultaneously, with, each, corner, paired, up, with, a, second, layer, edge, piece, thus, completing, the, first, two, layers, f2l, this, is, then, followed, by, orienting, the, last, layer, then, permuting, the, last, layer, oll, and, pll, respectively, there, are, a, total, of, 120, algorithms, for, fridrich, s, method, however, they, are, not, all, required, to, use, the, cfop, method, most, dedicated, cubers, will, learn, as, many, of, these, algorithms, as, possible, and, most, advanced, cubers, know, all, of, them, if, a, cuber, knows, every, algorithm, for, oll, they, may, be, described, as, knowing, full, oll, it, is, the, same, for, pll, and, f2l, a, now, well, known, method, was, developed, by, lars, petrus, in, this, method, a, 2, 2, 2, section, is, solved, first, followed, by, a, 2, 2, 3, and, then, the, incorrect, edges, are, solved, using, a, three, move, algorithm, which, eliminates, the, need, for, a, possible, 32, move, algorithm, later, the, principle, behind, this, is, that, in, layer, by, layer, one, must, constantly, break, and, fix, the, completed, layer, s, the, 2, 2, 2, and, 2, 2, 3, sections, allow, three, or, two, layers, respectively, to, be, turned, without, ruining, progress, one, of, the, advantages, of, this, method, is, that, it, tends, to, give, solutions, in, fewer, moves, for, this, reason, the, method, is, also, popular, for, fewest, move, competitions, the, roux, method, developed, by, gilles, roux, is, similar, to, the, petrus, method, in, that, it, relies, on, block, building, rather, than, layers, but, derives, from, corners, first, methods, in, roux, a, 3, 2, 1, block, is, solved, followed, by, another, 3, 2, 1, on, the, opposite, side, next, the, corners, of, the, top, layer, are, solved, the, cube, can, then, be, solved, using, only, moves, of, the, u, layer, and, m, slice, most, beginner, solution, methods, involve, solving, the, cube, one, layer, at, a, time, layer, by, layer, method, or, beginner, s, method, using, algorithms, that, preserve, what, has, already, been, solved, the, easiest, layer, by, layer, methods, require, only, 3, 8, algorithms, in, 1981, thirteen, year, old, patrick, bossert, developed, a, solution, for, solving, the, cube, along, with, a, graphical, notation, designed, to, be, easily, understood, by, novices, it, was, subsequently, published, as, you, can, do, the, cube, and, became, a, best, seller, in, 1997, denny, dedmore, published, a, solution, described, using, diagrammatic, icons, representing, the, moves, to, be, made, instead, of, the, usual, notation, philip, marshall, s, the, ultimate, solution, to, rubik, s, cube, takes, a, different, approach, averaging, only, 65, twists, yet, requiring, the, memorisation, of, only, two, algorithms, the, cross, is, solved, first, followed, by, the, remaining, edges, using, the, edge, piece, series, fr, f, r, then, five, corners, using, the, corner, piece, series, uru, l, ur, u, l, which, is, the, same, as, the, typical, last, layer, corner, permutation, algorithm, and, finally, the, last, three, corners, the, most, move, optimal, online, rubik, s, cube, solver, programs, use, herbert, kociemba, s, two, phase, algorithm, which, can, typically, determine, a, solution, of, 20, moves, or, fewer, the, user, has, to, set, the, colour, configuration, of, the, scrambled, cube, and, the, program, returns, the, steps, required, to, solve, it, speedcubing, or, speedsolving, is, the, practice, of, trying, to, solve, a, rubik, s, cube, in, the, shortest, time, possible, there, are, a, number, of, speedcubing, competitions, that, take, place, around, the, world, a, speedcubing, championship, organised, by, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, was, held, in, munich, on, 13, march, 1981, the, contest, used, standardised, scrambling, and, fixed, inspection, times, and, the, winners, were, ronald, brinkmann, and, jury, fr, schl, with, times, of, 38, 0, seconds, the, first, world, championship, was, the, 1982, world, rubik, s, cube, championship, held, in, budapest, on, 5, june, 1982, which, was, won, by, minh, thai, a, vietnamese, student, from, los, angeles, with, a, time, of, 22, 95, seconds, since, 2003, the, winner, of, a, competition, is, determined, by, taking, the, average, time, of, the, middle, three, of, five, attempts, however, the, single, best, time, of, all, tries, is, also, recorded, the, world, cube, association, maintains, a, history, of, world, records, in, 2004, the, wca, made, it, mandatory, to, use, a, special, timing, device, called, a, stackmat, timer, in, addition, to, the, main, 3x3x3, event, the, wca, also, holds, events, where, the, cube, is, solved, in, different, ways, in, blindfolded, solving, the, contestant, first, studies, the, scrambled, cube, i, e, looking, at, it, normally, with, no, blindfold, and, is, then, blindfolded, before, beginning, to, turn, the, cube, s, faces, their, recorded, time, for, this, event, includes, both, the, time, spent, memorizing, the, cube, and, the, time, spent, manipulating, it, in, multiple, blindfolded, solving, all, of, the, cubes, are, memorised, and, then, all, of, the, cubes, are, solved, once, blindfolded, thus, the, main, challenge, is, memorising, many, often, ten, or, more, separate, cubes, the, event, is, scored, not, by, time, but, by, the, number, of, points, achieved, after, the, one, hour, time, limit, has, elapsed, the, number, of, points, achieved, is, equal, to, the, number, of, cubes, solved, correctly, minus, the, number, of, cubes, unsolved, after, the, end, of, the, attempt, where, a, greater, number, of, points, is, better, if, multiple, competitors, achieve, the, same, number, of, points, rankings, are, assessed, based, on, the, total, time, of, the, attempt, with, a, shorter, time, being, better, in, fewest, moves, solving, the, contestant, is, given, one, hour, to, find, a, solution, and, must, write, it, down, there, are, many, different, variations, of, rubik, s, cubes, the, most, common, class, of, variants, changes, the, order, of, the, cube, defined, by, the, number, of, layers, in, each, dimension, or, equivalently, by, the, number, of, pieces, along, each, edge, including, corners, the, 2, 2, 2, pocket, mini, cube, the, standard, 3, 3, 3, cube, the, 4, 4, 4, rubik, s, revenge, master, cube, and, the, 5, 5, 5, professor, s, cube, are, the, most, well, known, as, they, are, all, available, under, the, official, rubik, s, brand, the, wca, sanctions, speedsolving, competitions, for, cube, orders, up, to, 7, 7, 7, these, big, cubes, represent, about, the, limit, of, practicality, for, the, purpose, of, competitive, speedsolving, as, the, cubes, become, increasingly, ungainly, and, prone, to, mechanical, failure, such, as, popping, where, one, or, more, pieces, become, dislodged, from, the, puzzle, and, average, solve, times, increase, quadratically, with, each, larger, order, in, proportion, to, the, number, of, total, facelets, of, the, cube, even, larger, cubes, based, on, the, v, cube, patents, are, commercially, available, to, the, mass, market, from, non, licensed, manufacturers, most, of, them, chinese, firms, which, also, produce, popular, cubes, designed, for, speed, solving, the, 17, 17, 17, over, the, top, cube, available, late, 2011, was, until, december, 2017, the, largest, commercially, sold, cube, and, the, most, expensive, costing, over, us, 2000, a, mass, produced, 17, 17, 17, was, later, introduced, by, the, chinese, manufacturer, yuxin, a, working, design, for, a, 22, 22, 22, cube, exists, and, was, demonstrated, in, january, 2016, and, a, 33, 33, 33, in, december, 2017, though, designs, this, large, are, not, currently, mass, produced, chinese, manufacturer, shengshou, has, been, producing, cubes, in, all, sizes, from, 2, 2, 2, to, 15, 15, 15, as, of, may, 2020, and, has, also, come, out, with, a, 17, 17, 17, the, largest, currently, mass, produced, cube, is, 21, 21, 21, made, by, moyu, beginning, in, 2021, and, costing, between, 1100, and, 1600, there, are, many, variations, of, the, original, cube, some, of, which, are, made, by, rubik, the, mechanical, products, include, rubik, s, magic, 360, and, twist, there, are, electronic, variants, such, as, rubik, s, revolution, and, slide, that, were, also, inspired, by, the, original, one, of, the, 3, 3, 3, cube, variants, is, rubik, s, touchcube, sliding, a, finger, across, its, faces, causes, its, patterns, of, coloured, lights, to, rotate, the, same, way, they, would, on, a, mechanical, cube, the, touchcube, also, has, buttons, for, hints, and, self, solving, and, it, includes, a, charging, stand, the, touchcube, was, introduced, at, the, american, international, toy, fair, in, new, york, on, 15, february, 2009, the, cube, has, inspired, an, entire, category, of, similar, puzzles, commonly, referred, to, as, twisty, puzzles, which, includes, the, cubes, of, different, sizes, mentioned, above, as, well, as, various, other, geometric, shapes, some, such, shapes, include, the, tetrahedron, pyraminx, the, octahedron, skewb, diamond, the, dodecahedron, megaminx, and, the, icosahedron, dogic, there, are, also, puzzles, that, change, shape, such, as, rubik, s, snake, and, the, square, one, in, 2011, guinness, world, records, awarded, the, largest, order, rubiks, magic, cube, to, a, 17, 17, 17, cube, made, by, oskar, van, deventer, on, 2, december, 2017, gr, goire, pfennig, announced, that, he, had, broken, this, record, with, a, 33, 33, 33, cube, and, that, his, claim, had, been, submitted, to, guinness, for, verification, on, 8, april, 2018, gr, goire, pfennig, announced, another, world, record, the, 2x2x50, cube, whether, this, is, a, replacement, for, the, 33, 33, 33, record, or, an, additional, record, remains, to, be, seen, some, puzzles, have, also, been, created, in, the, shape, of, kepler, poinsot, polyhedra, such, as, alexander, s, star, a, great, dodecahedron, gr, goire, pfennig, has, also, created, at, least, one, puzzle, in, the, shape, of, a, small, stellated, dodecahedron, puzzles, have, been, built, resembling, rubik, s, cube, or, based, on, its, inner, workings, for, example, a, cuboid, is, a, puzzle, based, on, rubik, s, cube, but, with, different, functional, dimensions, such, as, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 4, and, 3, 3, 5, other, rubik, s, cube, modifications, include, shape, mods, cubes, that, have, been, extended, or, truncated, to, form, a, new, shape, an, example, of, this, is, the, trabjer, s, octahedron, which, can, be, built, by, truncating, and, extending, portions, of, a, regular, 3, 3, 3, most, shape, modifications, can, be, adapted, to, higher, order, cubes, in, the, case, of, tony, fisher, s, rhombic, dodecahedron, there, are, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, and, 6, 6, 6, versions, of, the, puzzle, puzzles, like, rubik, s, cube, can, be, simulated, by, computer, software, to, provide, very, large, puzzles, that, are, impractical, to, build, as, well, as, virtual, puzzles, that, cannot, be, physically, built, such, as, many, higher, dimensional, analogues, of, the, rubik, s, cube, google, has, released, the, chrome, cube, lab, in, association, with, ern, rubik, the, site, has, various, interactive, objects, based, on, rubik, s, cube, customised, versions, of, rubik, s, cube, can, be, created, and, uploaded, liberty, science, center, in, jersey, city, new, jersey, and, google, designed, an, interactive, exhibit, based, on, the, rubik, s, cube, it, opened, in, april, 2014, in, celebration, of, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, cube, s, invention, before, traveling, internationally, for, seven, years, exhibition, elements, include, a, 35, foot, tall, rooftop, cube, made, of, lights, that, people, can, manipulate, with, their, cellphones, a, 2, 5, million, cube, made, of, diamonds, a, giant, walk, in, cube, displaying, the, inner, workings, of, the, puzzle, and, cube, solving, robots, probably, from, the, earliest, days, of, the, rubik, s, cube, craze, in, the, 1980s, people, have, assembled, cubes, to, form, simple, art, pieces, several, early, folk, artists, are, noted, for, their, work, rubik, s, cubes, have, also, been, the, subject, of, several, pop, art, installations, owing, to, their, popularity, as, a, children, s, toy, several, artists, and, groups, have, created, large, rubik, s, cubes, tony, rosenthal, s, alamo, the, astor, place, cube, is, a, spinnable, statue, of, a, cube, standing, in, new, york, city, once, the, cube, was, covered, with, coloured, panels, so, that, it, resembled, a, rubik, s, cube, similarly, the, university, of, michigan, students, covered, endover, creating, a, large, rubik, s, cube, on, the, university, of, michigan, s, central, campus, for, april, fool, s, day, in, 2008, beyond, the, folk, art, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, and, the, simple, replication, of, a, rubik, s, cube, in, oversized, form, artists, have, developed, a, pointillist, art, style, using, the, cubes, rubik, s, cube, art, a, k, a, rubik, s, cubism, or, rubikcubism, makes, use, of, a, standard, rubik, s, cube, a, popular, puzzle, toy, of, the, 1980s, the, earliest, recorded, artworks, appear, to, have, been, created, by, fred, holly, a, legally, blind, man, in, his, 60s, in, the, mid, 1980s, these, early, pieces, focus, on, geometrics, and, colour, patterns, there, does, not, appear, to, be, other, recorded, art, pieces, until, the, mid, 1990s, by, cube, aficionados, involved, in, the, puzzle, and, game, industry, the, folk, art, form, reached, another, level, of, its, evolution, with, the, development, and, maturity, into, a, pop, art, form, consisting, of, pointillist, cube, art, renderings, the, street, artist, who, uses, the, alias, invader, or, space, invader, started, exhibiting, pointillist, pieces, including, one, of, a, man, behind, a, desk, and, mario, bros, using, rubik, s, cube, in, june, 2005, in, an, exhibition, named, rubik, cubism, at, sixspace, in, los, angeles, prior, to, this, exhibition, the, artist, had, used, rubik, s, cubes, to, create, giant, space, invaders, another, artist, includes, robbie, mackinnon, of, toronto, canada, with, earliest, published, work, in, 2007, who, claims, to, have, developed, his, pointillist, cube, art, years, earlier, while, being, a, teacher, in, china, robbie, mackinnon, s, work, has, been, exhibited, in, ripley, s, believe, it, or, not, and, focussed, on, using, pop, art, while, space, invader, has, exhibited, his, cube, art, alongside, mosaic, space, invaders, in, commercial, and, public, galleries, in, 2010, artist, pete, fecteau, created, dream, big, a, tribute, to, martin, luther, king, jr, using, 4, 242, officially, licensed, rubik, s, cubes, fecteau, also, worked, with, the, organization, you, can, do, the, rubik, s, cube, to, create, two, separate, guides, designed, to, teach, school, children, how, to, create, rubik, s, cube, mosaics, from, templates, which, he, also, created, italian, composer, maria, mannone, created, a, cube, called, cubeharmonic, which, has, musical, note, names, on, its, facets, creating, different, chord, structures, depending, on, its, configuration
