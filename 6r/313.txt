russian, game, ochko, the, game, is, a, comparing, card, game, where, players, compete, against, the, dealer, rather, than, each, other, blackjack, s, immediate, precursor, was, the, english, version, of, twenty, one, called, vingt, un, a, game, of, unknown, provenance, the, first, written, reference, is, found, in, a, book, by, the, spanish, author, miguel, de, cervantes, cervantes, was, a, gambler, and, the, protagonists, of, his, rinconete, y, cortadillo, from, novelas, ejemplares, are, card, cheats, in, seville, they, are, proficient, at, cheating, at, veintiuno, spanish, for, twenty, one, and, state, that, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, reach, 21, points, without, going, over, and, that, the, ace, values, 1, or, 11, the, game, is, played, with, the, spanish, baraja, deck, rinconete, y, cortadillo, was, written, between, 1601, and, 1602, implying, that, ventiuno, was, played, in, castile, since, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, or, earlier, later, references, to, this, game, are, found, in, france, and, spain, the, first, record, of, the, game, in, france, occurs, in, 1888, and, in, britain, during, the, 1770s, and, 1780s, but, the, first, rules, appeared, in, britain, in, 1800, under, the, name, of, vingt, un, twenty, one, still, known, then, as, vingt, un, appeared, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1800s, the, first, american, rules, were, an, 1825, reprint, of, the, 1800, english, rules, english, vingt, un, later, developed, into, an, american, variant, in, its, own, right, which, was, renamed, blackjack, around, 1899, according, to, popular, myth, when, vingt, un, twenty, one, was, introduced, into, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1800s, during, the, first, world, war, or, in, the, 1930s, depending, on, the, source, gambling, houses, offered, bonus, payouts, to, stimulate, players, interest, one, such, bonus, was, a, ten, to, one, payout, if, the, player, s, hand, consisted, of, the, ace, of, spades, and, a, black, jack, either, the, jack, of, clubs, or, the, jack, of, spades, this, hand, was, called, a, blackjack, and, the, name, stuck, even, after, the, ten, to, one, bonus, was, withdrawn, french, card, historian, thierry, depaulis, debunks, this, story, showing, that, prospectors, during, the, klondike, gold, rush, 1896, 99, gave, the, name, blackjack, to, the, game, of, american, vingt, un, the, bonus, being, the, usual, ace, and, any, 10, point, card, since, blackjack, also, refers, to, the, mineral, zincblende, which, was, often, associated, with, gold, or, silver, deposits, he, suggests, that, the, mineral, name, was, transferred, by, prospectors, to, the, top, bonus, hand, he, could, not, find, any, historical, evidence, for, a, special, bonus, for, having, the, combination, of, an, ace, and, a, black, jack, in, september, 1956, roger, baldwin, wilbert, cantey, herbert, maisel, and, james, mcdermott, published, a, paper, titled, the, optimum, strategy, in, blackjack, in, the, journal, of, the, american, statistical, association, the, first, mathematically, sound, optimal, blackjack, strategy, this, paper, became, the, foundation, of, future, efforts, to, beat, blackjack, ed, thorp, used, baldwin, s, hand, calculations, to, verify, the, basic, strategy, and, later, published, in, 1963, beat, the, dealer, at, a, blackjack, table, the, dealer, faces, five, to, nine, playing, positions, from, behind, a, semicircular, table, between, one, and, eight, standard, 52, card, decks, are, shuffled, together, to, start, each, round, players, place, bets, in, the, betting, box, at, each, position, in, jurisdictions, allowing, back, betting, up, to, three, players, can, be, at, each, position, the, player, whose, bet, is, at, the, front, of, the, betting, box, controls, the, position, and, the, dealer, consults, the, controlling, player, for, playing, decisions, the, other, bettors, play, behind, a, player, can, usually, control, or, bet, in, as, many, boxes, as, desired, at, a, single, table, but, an, individual, cannot, play, on, more, than, one, table, at, a, time, or, place, multiple, bets, within, a, single, box, in, many, u, s, casinos, players, are, limited, to, playing, one, to, three, positions, at, a, table, the, dealer, deals, from, their, left, first, base, to, their, far, right, third, base, each, box, gets, an, initial, hand, of, two, cards, visible, to, the, people, playing, on, it, the, dealer, s, hand, gets, its, first, card, face, up, and, in, hole, card, games, immediately, gets, a, second, card, face, down, the, hole, card, which, the, dealer, peeks, at, but, only, reveals, when, it, makes, the, dealer, s, hand, a, blackjack, hole, card, games, are, sometimes, played, on, tables, with, a, small, mirror, or, electronic, sensor, used, to, peek, securely, at, the, hole, card, in, european, casinos, no, hole, card, games, are, prevalent, the, dealer, s, second, card, is, not, drawn, until, the, players, have, played, their, hands, dealers, deal, the, cards, from, one, or, two, handheld, decks, from, a, dealer, s, shoe, or, from, a, shuffling, machine, single, cards, are, dealt, to, each, wagered, on, position, clockwise, from, the, dealer, s, left, followed, by, a, single, card, to, the, dealer, followed, by, an, additional, card, to, each, of, the, positions, in, play, the, players, initial, cards, may, be, dealt, face, up, or, face, down, more, common, in, single, deck, games, the, object, of, the, game, is, to, win, money, by, creating, card, totals, higher, than, those, of, the, dealer, s, hand, but, not, exceeding, 21, or, by, stopping, at, a, total, in, the, hope, that, the, dealer, will, bust, on, their, turn, players, choose, to, hit, take, a, card, stand, end, their, turn, and, stop, without, taking, a, card, double, double, their, wager, take, a, single, card, and, finish, split, if, the, two, cards, have, the, same, value, separate, them, to, make, two, hands, or, surrender, give, up, a, half, bet, and, retire, from, the, game, number, cards, count, as, their, number, the, jack, queen, and, king, face, cards, or, pictures, count, as, 10, and, aces, count, as, either, 1, or, 11, according, to, the, player, s, choice, if, the, total, exceeds, 21, points, it, busts, and, all, bets, on, it, immediately, lose, after, the, boxes, have, finished, playing, the, dealer, s, hand, is, resolved, by, drawing, cards, until, the, hand, achieves, a, total, of, 17, or, higher, if, the, dealer, has, a, total, of, 17, including, an, ace, valued, as, 11, a, soft, 17, some, games, require, the, dealer, to, stand, while, other, games, require, another, draw, the, dealer, never, doubles, splits, or, surrenders, if, the, dealer, busts, all, remaining, player, hands, win, if, the, dealer, does, not, bust, each, remaining, bet, wins, if, its, hand, is, higher, than, the, dealer, s, and, loses, if, it, is, lower, a, player, total, of, 21, on, the, first, two, cards, is, a, natural, or, blackjack, and, the, player, wins, immediately, unless, the, dealer, also, has, one, in, which, case, the, hand, ties, in, the, case, of, a, tie, push, or, standoff, bets, are, returned, without, adjustment, a, blackjack, beats, any, hand, that, is, not, a, blackjack, even, one, with, a, value, of, 21, wins, are, paid, out, at, even, money, except, for, player, blackjacks, which, are, traditionally, paid, out, at, 3, to, 2, odds, many, casinos, today, pay, blackjacks, at, less, than, 3, 2, this, is, common, in, single, deck, blackjack, games, blackjack, games, usually, offer, a, side, bet, called, insurance, which, may, be, placed, when, the, dealer, s, face, up, card, is, an, ace, additional, side, bets, such, as, dealer, match, which, pays, when, the, player, s, cards, match, the, dealer, s, up, card, are, also, sometimes, available, after, the, initial, two, cards, the, player, has, up, to, five, options, hit, stand, double, down, split, or, surrender, each, option, has, a, corresponding, hand, signal, hand, signals, help, the, eye, in, the, sky, make, a, video, recording, of, the, table, which, resolves, disputes, and, identifies, dealer, mistakes, it, is, also, used, to, protect, the, casino, against, dealers, who, steal, chips, or, players, who, cheat, recordings, can, also, identify, advantage, players, when, a, player, s, hand, signal, disagrees, with, their, words, the, hand, signal, takes, precedence, a, hand, can, hit, as, often, as, desired, until, the, total, is, 21, or, more, players, must, stand, on, a, total, of, 21, after, a, bust, or, a, stand, play, proceeds, to, the, next, hand, clockwise, around, the, table, after, the, last, hand, is, played, the, dealer, reveals, the, hole, card, and, stands, or, draws, according, to, the, game, s, rules, when, the, outcome, of, the, dealer, s, hand, is, established, any, hands, with, bets, remaining, on, the, table, are, resolved, usually, in, counterclockwise, order, bets, on, losing, hands, are, forfeited, the, bet, on, a, push, is, left, on, the, table, and, winners, are, paid, out, if, the, dealer, shows, an, ace, an, insurance, bet, is, allowed, insurance, is, a, side, bet, that, the, dealer, has, a, blackjack, the, dealer, asks, for, insurance, bets, before, the, first, player, plays, insurance, bets, of, up, to, half, the, player, s, current, bet, are, placed, on, the, insurance, bar, above, the, player, s, cards, if, the, dealer, has, a, blackjack, insurance, pays, 2, to, 1, in, most, casinos, the, dealer, looks, at, the, down, card, and, pays, off, or, takes, the, insurance, bet, immediately, in, other, casinos, the, payoff, waits, until, the, end, of, the, play, in, face, down, games, if, a, player, has, more, than, one, hand, they, can, look, at, all, their, hands, before, deciding, this, is, the, only, condition, where, a, player, can, look, at, multiple, hands, players, with, blackjack, can, also, take, insurance, when, this, happens, it, is, called, even, money, as, the, player, is, giving, up, their, 3, 2, payout, for, a, 1, 1, payout, when, taking, insurance, with, a, blackjack, under, the, condition, that, they, still, get, paid, if, the, dealer, also, has, a, blackjack, insurance, bets, lose, money, in, the, long, run, the, dealer, has, a, blackjack, less, than, one, third, of, the, time, in, some, games, players, can, also, take, insurance, when, a, 10, valued, card, shows, but, the, dealer, has, an, ace, in, the, hole, less, than, one, tenth, of, the, time, the, insurance, bet, is, susceptible, to, advantage, play, it, is, advantageous, to, make, an, insurance, bet, whenever, the, hole, card, has, more, than, a, one, in, three, chance, of, being, a, ten, card, counting, techniques, can, identify, such, situations, note, where, changes, in, the, house, edge, due, to, changes, in, the, rules, are, stated, in, percentage, terms, the, difference, is, usually, stated, here, in, percentage, points, not, a, percentage, for, example, if, an, edge, of, 10, is, reduced, to, 9, it, is, reduced, by, one, percentage, point, not, reduced, by, ten, percent, blackjack, rules, are, generally, set, by, regulations, that, establish, permissible, rule, variations, at, the, casino, s, discretion, blackjack, comes, with, a, house, edge, the, casino, s, statistical, advantage, is, built, into, the, game, most, of, the, house, s, edge, comes, from, the, fact, that, the, player, loses, when, both, the, player, and, dealer, bust, blackjack, players, using, basic, strategy, lose, on, average, less, than, 1, of, their, action, over, the, long, run, giving, blackjack, one, of, the, lowest, edges, in, the, casino, the, house, edge, for, games, where, blackjack, pays, 6, to, 5, instead, of, 3, to, 2, increases, by, about, 1, 4, though, player, deviations, from, basic, strategy, also, increase, the, house, edge, each, game, has, a, rule, about, whether, the, dealer, must, hit, or, stand, on, soft, 17, which, is, generally, printed, on, the, table, surface, the, variation, where, the, dealer, must, hit, soft, 17, is, abbreviated, h17, in, blackjack, literature, with, s17, used, for, the, stand, on, soft, 17, variation, substituting, an, h17, rule, with, an, s17, rule, in, a, game, benefits, the, player, decreasing, the, house, edge, by, about, 0, 2, all, things, being, equal, using, fewer, decks, decreases, the, house, edge, this, mainly, reflects, an, increased, likelihood, of, player, blackjack, since, if, the, player, draws, a, ten, on, their, first, card, the, subsequent, probability, of, drawing, an, ace, is, higher, with, fewer, decks, it, also, reflects, the, decreased, likelihood, of, a, blackjack, blackjack, push, in, a, game, with, fewer, decks, casinos, generally, compensate, by, tightening, other, rules, in, games, with, fewer, decks, to, preserve, the, house, edge, or, discourage, play, altogether, when, offering, single, deck, blackjack, games, casinos, are, more, likely, to, disallow, doubling, on, soft, hands, or, after, splitting, restrict, resplitting, require, higher, minimum, bets, and, pay, the, player, less, than, 3, 2, for, a, winning, blackjack, the, following, table, illustrates, the, mathematical, effect, on, the, house, edge, of, the, number, of, decks, by, considering, games, with, various, deck, counts, under, the, following, ruleset, double, after, split, allowed, resplit, to, four, hands, allowed, no, hitting, split, aces, no, surrendering, double, on, any, two, cards, original, bets, only, lost, on, dealer, blackjack, dealer, hits, soft, 17, and, cut, card, used, the, increase, in, house, edge, per, unit, increase, in, the, number, of, decks, is, most, dramatic, when, comparing, the, single, deck, game, to, the, two, deck, game, and, becomes, progressively, smaller, as, more, decks, are, added, surrender, for, those, games, that, allow, it, is, usually, not, permitted, against, a, dealer, blackjack, if, the, dealer, s, first, card, is, an, ace, or, ten, the, hole, card, is, checked, to, make, sure, there, is, no, blackjack, before, surrender, is, offered, this, rule, protocol, is, consequently, known, as, late, surrender, the, alternative, early, surrender, gives, the, player, the, option, to, surrender, before, the, dealer, checks, for, blackjack, or, in, a, no, hole, card, game, early, surrender, is, much, more, favorable, to, the, player, than, late, surrender, for, late, surrender, however, while, it, is, tempting, to, opt, for, surrender, on, any, hand, which, will, probably, lose, the, correct, strategy, is, to, only, surrender, on, the, very, worst, hands, because, having, even, a, one, in, four, chance, of, winning, the, full, bet, is, better, than, losing, half, the, bet, and, pushing, the, other, half, as, entailed, by, surrendering, if, the, cards, of, a, post, split, hand, have, the, same, value, most, games, allow, the, player, to, split, again, or, resplit, the, player, places, a, further, wager, and, the, dealer, separates, the, new, pair, dealing, a, further, card, to, each, as, before, some, games, allow, unlimited, resplitting, while, others, may, limit, it, to, a, certain, number, of, hands, such, as, four, hands, for, example, resplit, to, 4, after, splitting, aces, the, common, rule, is, that, only, one, card, will, be, dealt, to, each, ace, the, player, cannot, split, double, or, take, another, hit, on, either, hand, rule, variants, include, allowing, resplitting, aces, or, allowing, the, player, to, hit, split, aces, games, allowing, aces, to, be, resplit, are, not, uncommon, but, those, allowing, the, player, to, hit, split, aces, are, extremely, rare, allowing, the, player, to, hit, hands, resulting, from, split, aces, reduces, the, house, edge, by, about, 0, 13, allowing, resplitting, of, aces, reduces, the, house, edge, by, about, 0, 03, note, that, a, ten, value, card, dealt, on, a, split, ace, or, vice, versa, will, not, be, counted, as, a, blackjack, but, as, a, soft, 21, after, a, split, most, games, allow, doubling, down, on, the, new, two, card, hands, disallowing, doubling, after, a, split, increases, the, house, edge, by, about, 0, 12, under, the, reno, rule, doubling, down, is, only, permitted, on, hard, totals, of, 9, 10, or, 11, under, a, similar, european, rule, only, 10, or, 11, the, basic, strategy, would, otherwise, call, for, some, doubling, down, with, hard, 9, and, soft, 13, 18, and, advanced, players, can, identify, situations, where, doubling, on, soft, 19, 20, and, hard, 8, 7, and, even, 6, is, advantageous, the, reno, rule, prevents, the, player, from, taking, advantage, of, double, down, in, these, situations, and, thereby, increases, the, player, s, expected, loss, the, reno, rule, increases, the, house, edge, by, around, 0, 1, and, its, european, version, by, around, 0, 2, in, most, non, u, s, casinos, a, no, hole, card, game, is, played, meaning, that, the, dealer, does, not, draw, nor, consult, their, second, card, until, after, all, players, have, finished, making, decisions, with, no, hole, card, it, is, rarely, the, correct, basic, strategy, to, double, or, split, against, a, dealer, ten, or, ace, since, a, dealer, blackjack, will, result, in, the, loss, of, the, split, and, double, bets, the, only, exception, is, with, a, pair, of, aces, against, a, dealer, 10, where, it, is, still, correct, to, split, in, all, other, cases, a, stand, hit, or, surrender, is, called, for, for, instance, when, holding, 11, against, a, dealer, 10, the, correct, strategy, is, to, double, in, a, hole, card, game, where, the, player, knows, the, dealer, s, second, card, is, not, an, ace, but, to, hit, in, a, no, hole, card, game, the, no, hole, card, rule, adds, approximately, 0, 11, to, the, house, edge, the, original, bets, only, rule, variation, appearing, in, certain, no, hole, card, games, states, that, if, the, player, s, hand, loses, to, a, dealer, blackjack, only, the, mandatory, initial, bet, original, is, forfeited, and, all, optional, bets, meaning, doubles, and, splits, are, pushed, original, bets, only, is, also, known, by, the, acronym, obo, it, has, the, same, effect, on, basic, strategy, and, the, house, edge, as, reverting, to, a, hole, card, game, in, many, casinos, a, blackjack, pays, only, 6, 5, or, even, 1, 1, instead, of, the, usual, 3, 2, this, is, most, common, at, tables, with, lower, table, minimums, although, this, payoff, was, originally, limited, to, single, deck, games, it, has, spread, to, double, deck, and, shoe, games, among, common, rule, variations, in, the, u, s, these, altered, payouts, for, blackjack, are, the, most, damaging, to, the, player, causing, the, greatest, increase, in, house, edge, since, blackjack, occurs, in, approximately, 4, 8, of, hands, the, 1, 1, game, increases, the, house, edge, by, 2, 3, while, the, 6, 5, game, adds, 1, 4, to, the, house, edge, video, blackjack, machines, generally, pay, a, 1, 1, payout, for, a, blackjack, the, rule, that, bets, on, tied, hands, are, lost, rather, than, pushed, is, catastrophic, to, the, player, though, rarely, used, in, standard, blackjack, it, is, sometimes, seen, in, blackjack, like, games, such, as, in, some, charity, casinos, each, blackjack, game, has, a, basic, strategy, the, optimal, method, of, playing, any, hand, when, using, basic, strategy, the, long, term, house, advantage, the, expected, loss, of, the, player, is, minimized, an, example, of, a, basic, strategy, is, shown, in, the, table, below, which, applies, to, a, game, with, the, following, specifications, key, most, basic, strategy, decisions, are, the, same, for, all, blackjack, games, rule, variations, call, for, changes, in, only, a, few, situations, for, example, to, use, the, table, above, on, a, game, with, the, stand, on, soft, 17, rule, which, favors, the, player, and, is, typically, found, only, at, higher, limit, tables, today, only, 6, cells, would, need, to, be, changed, hit, on, 11, vs, a, hit, on, 15, vs, a, stand, on, 17, vs, a, stand, on, a, 7, vs, 2, stand, on, a, 8, vs, 6, and, split, on, 8, 8, vs, a, regardless, of, the, specific, rule, variations, taking, insurance, or, even, money, is, never, the, correct, play, under, a, basic, strategy, estimates, of, the, house, edge, for, blackjack, games, quoted, by, casinos, and, gaming, regulators, are, based, on, the, assumption, that, the, players, follow, basic, strategy, most, blackjack, games, have, a, house, edge, of, between, 0, 5, and, 1, placing, blackjack, among, the, cheapest, casino, table, games, for, the, player, casino, promotions, such, as, complimentary, matchplay, vouchers, or, 2, 1, blackjack, payouts, allow, players, to, acquire, an, advantage, without, deviating, from, basic, strategy, the, basic, strategy, is, based, on, a, player, s, point, total, and, the, dealer, s, visible, card, players, can, sometimes, improve, on, this, decision, by, considering, the, composition, of, their, hand, not, just, the, point, total, for, example, players, should, ordinarily, stand, when, holding, 12, against, a, dealer, 4, but, in, a, single, deck, game, players, should, hit, if, their, 12, consists, of, a, 10, and, a, 2, the, presence, of, a, 10, in, the, player, s, hand, has, two, consequences, even, when, basic, and, composition, dependent, strategies, lead, to, different, actions, the, difference, in, expected, reward, is, small, and, it, becomes, smaller, with, more, decks, using, a, composition, dependent, strategy, rather, than, a, basic, strategy, in, a, single, deck, game, reduces, the, house, edge, by, 4, in, 10, 000, which, falls, to, 3, in, 100, 000, for, a, six, deck, game, blackjack, has, been, a, high, profile, target, for, advantage, players, since, the, 1960s, advantage, play, attempts, to, win, more, using, skills, such, as, memory, computation, and, observation, while, these, techniques, are, legal, they, can, give, players, a, mathematical, edge, in, the, game, making, advantage, players, unwanted, customers, for, casinos, advantage, play, can, lead, to, ejection, or, blacklisting, some, advantageous, play, techniques, in, blackjack, include, during, the, course, of, a, blackjack, shoe, the, dealer, exposes, the, dealt, cards, players, can, infer, from, their, accounting, of, the, exposed, cards, which, cards, remain, these, inferences, can, be, used, in, the, following, ways, a, card, counting, system, assigns, a, point, score, to, each, card, rank, e, g, 1, point, for, 2, 6, 0, points, for, 7, 9, and, 1, point, for, 10, a, when, a, card, is, exposed, a, counter, adds, the, score, of, that, card, to, a, running, total, the, count, a, card, counter, uses, this, count, to, make, betting, and, playing, decisions, the, count, starts, at, 0, for, a, freshly, shuffled, deck, for, balanced, counting, systems, unbalanced, counts, are, often, started, at, a, value, that, depends, on, the, number, of, decks, used, in, the, game, blackjack, s, house, edge, is, usually, around, 0, 5, 1, when, players, use, basic, strategy, card, counting, can, give, the, player, an, edge, of, up, to, about, 2, 5, card, counting, works, best, when, a, few, cards, remain, this, makes, single, deck, games, better, for, counters, as, a, result, casinos, are, more, likely, to, insist, that, players, do, not, reveal, their, cards, to, one, another, in, single, deck, games, in, games, with, more, decks, casinos, limit, penetration, by, ending, the, shoe, and, reshuffling, when, one, or, more, decks, remain, undealt, casinos, also, sometimes, use, a, shuffling, machine, to, reintroduce, the, cards, whenever, a, deck, has, been, played, card, counting, is,
