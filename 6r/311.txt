a, card, game, is, any, game, that, uses, playing, cards, as, the, primary, device, with, which, the, game, is, played, whether, the, cards, are, of, a, traditional, design, or, specifically, created, for, the, game, proprietary, countless, card, games, exist, including, families, of, related, games, such, as, poker, a, small, number, of, card, games, played, with, traditional, decks, have, formally, standardized, rules, with, international, tournaments, being, held, but, most, are, folk, games, whose, rules, may, vary, by, region, culture, location, or, from, circle, to, circle, traditional, card, games, are, played, with, a, deck, or, pack, of, playing, cards, which, are, identical, in, size, and, shape, each, card, has, two, sides, the, face, and, the, back, normally, the, backs, of, the, cards, are, indistinguishable, the, faces, of, the, cards, may, all, be, unique, or, there, can, be, duplicates, the, composition, of, a, deck, is, known, to, each, player, in, some, cases, several, decks, are, shuffled, together, to, form, a, single, pack, or, shoe, modern, card, games, usually, have, bespoke, decks, often, with, a, vast, amount, of, cards, and, can, include, number, or, action, cards, this, type, of, game, is, generally, regarded, as, part, of, the, board, game, hobby, games, using, playing, cards, exploit, the, fact, that, cards, are, individually, identifiable, from, one, side, only, so, that, each, player, knows, only, the, cards, they, hold, and, not, those, held, by, anyone, else, for, this, reason, card, games, are, often, characterized, as, games, of, chance, or, imperfect, information, as, distinct, from, games, of, strategy, or, perfect, information, where, the, current, position, is, fully, visible, to, all, players, throughout, the, game, many, games, that, are, not, generally, placed, in, the, family, of, card, games, do, in, fact, use, cards, for, some, aspect, of, their, play, some, games, that, are, placed, in, the, card, game, genre, involve, a, board, the, distinction, is, that, the, play, in, a, card, game, chiefly, depends, on, the, use, of, the, cards, by, players, the, board, is, a, guide, for, scorekeeping, or, for, card, placement, while, board, games, the, principal, non, card, game, genre, to, use, cards, generally, focus, on, the, players, positions, on, the, board, and, use, the, cards, for, some, secondary, purpose, despite, the, presence, of, playing, cards, in, europe, being, recorded, from, around, 1370, it, is, not, until, 1408, that, the, first, card, game, is, described, in, a, document, about, the, exploits, of, two, card, sharps, although, it, is, evidently, very, simple, the, game, is, not, named, in, fact, the, earliest, games, to, be, mentioned, by, name, are, gleek, ronfa, and, condemnade, the, latter, being, the, game, played, by, the, aforementioned, card, cheats, all, three, are, recorded, during, the, 15th, century, along, with, karn, ffel, first, mentioned, in, 1426, and, which, is, still, played, in, several, forms, today, including, bruus, kn, ffeln, kaiserspiel, and, styrivolt, since, the, arrival, of, trick, taking, games, in, europe, in, the, late, 14th, century, there, have, only, been, two, major, innovations, the, first, was, the, introduction, of, trump, cards, with, the, power, to, beat, all, cards, in, other, suits, such, cards, were, initially, called, trionfi, and, first, appeared, with, the, advent, of, tarot, cards, in, which, there, is, a, separate, permanent, trump, suit, comprising, a, number, of, picture, cards, the, first, known, example, of, such, cards, was, ordered, by, the, duke, of, milan, around, 1420, and, included, 16, trumps, with, images, of, greek, and, roman, gods, thus, games, played, with, tarot, cards, appeared, very, early, on, and, spread, to, most, parts, of, europe, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, the, british, isles, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, balkans, however, we, do, not, know, the, rules, of, the, early, tarot, games, the, earliest, detailed, description, in, any, language, being, those, published, by, the, abb, de, marolles, in, nevers, in, 1637, the, concept, of, trumps, was, sufficiently, powerful, that, it, was, soon, transferred, to, games, played, with, far, cheaper, ordinary, packs, of, cards, as, opposed, to, expensive, tarot, cards, the, first, of, these, was, triomphe, the, name, simply, being, the, french, equivalent, of, the, italian, trionfi, although, not, testified, before, 1538, its, first, rules, were, written, by, a, spaniard, who, left, his, native, country, for, milan, in, 1509, never, to, return, thus, the, game, may, date, to, the, late, 15th, century, others, games, that, may, well, date, to, the, 15th, century, are, pochen, the, game, of, bocken, or, boeckels, being, attested, in, strasbourg, in, 1441, and, thirty, one, which, is, first, mentioned, in, a, french, translation, of, a, 1440, sermon, by, the, italian, saint, bernadine, the, name, actually, referring, to, two, different, card, games, one, like, pontoon, and, one, like, commerce, in, the, 16th, century, printed, documents, replace, handwritten, sources, and, card, games, become, a, popular, topic, with, preachers, autobiographists, and, writers, in, general, a, key, source, of, the, games, in, vogue, in, france, and, europe, at, that, time, is, fran, ois, rabelais, whose, fictional, character, gargantua, played, no, less, than, 30, card, games, many, of, which, are, recognisable, they, include, aluette, b, te, cent, coquimbert, coucou, flush, or, flux, g, pairs, gleek, lansquenet, piquet, post, and, pair, primero, ronfa, triomphe, sequence, speculation, tarot, and, trente, et, un, possibly, rams, mouche, and, brandeln, as, well, girolamo, cardano, also, provides, invaluable, information, including, the, earliest, rules, of, trappola, among, the, most, popular, were, the, games, of, flusso, and, primiera, which, originated, in, italy, and, spread, throughout, europe, becoming, known, in, england, as, flush, and, primero, in, britain, the, earliest, known, european, fishing, game, was, recorded, in, 1522, another, first, was, losing, loadum, noted, by, florio, in, 1591, which, is, the, earliest, known, english, point, trick, game, in, scotland, the, game, of, mawe, testified, in, the, 1550s, evolved, from, a, country, game, into, one, played, at, the, royal, scottish, court, becoming, a, favorite, of, james, vi, the, ancestor, of, cribbage, a, game, called, noddy, is, mentioned, for, the, first, time, in, 1589, noddy, being, the, knave, turned, for, trump, at, the, start, of, play, the, 17th, century, saw, an, upsurge, in, the, number, of, new, games, being, reported, as, well, as, the, first, sets, of, rules, those, for, piquet, appearing, in, 1632, and, reversis, in, 1634, the, first, french, games, compendium, la, maison, acad, mique, appeared, in, 1654, and, it, was, followed, in, 1674, by, charles, cotton, s, the, compleat, gamester, although, an, earlier, manuscript, of, games, by, francis, willughby, was, written, sometime, between, 1665, and, 1670, cotton, records, the, first, rules, for, the, classic, english, games, of, cribbage, a, descendant, of, noddy, and, whist, a, development, of, english, trump, or, ruff, ruff, then, meaning, rob, in, which, four, players, were, dealt, 12, cards, each, and, the, dealer, robbed, from, the, remaining, stock, of, 4, cards, piquet, was, a, two, player, trick, taking, game, that, originated, in, france, probably, in, the, 16th, century, and, was, initially, played, with, 36, cards, before, around, 1690, the, pack, reduced, to, the, 32, cards, that, gives, the, piquet, pack, its, name, reversis, is, a, reverse, game, in, which, players, avoid, taking, tricks, and, appears, to, be, an, italian, invention, that, came, to, france, around, 1600, and, spread, rapidly, to, other, countries, in, europe, in, the, mid, 17th, century, a, certain, game, named, after, cardinal, mazarin, prime, minister, to, king, louis, xiv, became, very, popular, at, the, french, royal, court, called, hoc, mazarin, it, had, three, phases, the, final, one, of, which, evolved, into, a, much, simpler, game, called, manille, that, was, renamed, com, te, on, the, appearance, of, halley, s, comet, in, 1682, in, com, te, the, aim, is, to, be, first, to, shed, all, one, s, hand, cards, to, sequences, laid, out, in, rows, on, the, table, however, there, are, certain, cards, known, as, stops, or, hocs, cards, that, end, a, sequence, and, give, the, one, who, played, it, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, start, a, new, sequence, this, concept, spread, to, other, 17th, and, 18th, century, games, including, poque, comete, emprunt, manille, nain, jaune, and, lindor, all, except, emprunt, being, still, played, in, some, form, today, it, was, the, 17th, century, that, saw, the, second, of, the, two, great, innovations, being, introduced, into, trick, taking, games, the, concept, of, bidding, this, first, emerged, in, the, spanish, game, of, ombre, an, evolution, of, triomphe, that, in, its, time, was, the, most, successful, card, game, ever, invented, ombre, s, origins, are, unclear, and, obfuscated, by, the, existence, of, a, game, called, homme, or, b, te, in, france, ombre, and, homme, being, respectively, spanish, and, french, for, man, in, ombre, the, player, who, won, the, bidding, became, the, man, and, played, alone, against, the, other, two, the, game, spread, rapidly, across, europe, spawning, variants, for, different, numbers, of, players, and, known, as, quadrille, quintille, m, diateur, and, solo, quadrille, went, on, to, become, highly, fashionable, in, england, during, the, 18th, century, and, is, mentioned, several, times, for, example, in, jane, austen, s, pride, and, prejudice, the, first, rules, of, any, game, in, the, german, language, were, those, for, r, mpffen, published, in, 1608, and, later, expanded, in, several, subsequent, editions, in, addition, the, first, german, games, compendium, palamedes, redivivus, appeared, in, 1678, containing, the, rules, for, hoick, hoc, ombre, picquet, sic, r, mpffen, and, thurnspiel, the, evolution, of, card, games, continued, apace, with, notable, national, games, emerging, like, briscola, and, tressette, italy, schafkopf, bavaria, jass, switzerland, mariage, the, ancestor, of, austria, s, schnapsen, and, germany, s, sixty, six, and, tapp, tarock, the, progenitor, of, most, modern, central, european,

made, up, by, the, dealer, most, of, these, games, however, typically, use, a, specially, made, deck, of, cards, designed, specifically, for, the, game, or, variations, of, it, the, decks, are, thus, usually, proprietary, but, may, be, created, by, the, game, s, players, uno, phase, 10, set, and, 1000, blank, white, cards, are, popular, dedicated, deck, card, games, 1000, blank, white, cards, is, unique, in, that, the, cards, for, the, game, are, designed, by, the, players, of, the, game, while, playing, it, there, is, no, commercially, available, deck, advertised, as, such, collectible, card, games, ccg, are, proprietary, playing, card, games, ccgs, are, games, of, strategy, between, two, or, more, players, each, player, has, their, own, deck, constructed, from, a, very, large, pool, of, unique, cards, in, the, commercial, market, the, cards, have, different, effects, costs, and, art, new, card, sets, are, released, periodically, and, sold, as, starter, decks, or, booster, packs, obtaining, the, different, cards, makes, the, game, a, collectible, card, game, and, cards, are, sold, or, traded, on, the, secondary, market, magic, the, gathering, pok, mon, and, yu, gi, oh, are, well, known, collectible, card, games, living, card, games, lcgs, are, similar, to, collectible, card, games, ccgs, with, their, most, distinguishing, feature, being, a, fixed, distribution, method, which, breaks, away, from, the, traditional, collectible, card, game, format, while, new, cards, for, ccgs, are, usually, sold, in, the, form, of, starter, decks, or, booster, packs, the, latter, being, often, randomized, lcgs, thrive, on, a, model, that, requires, players, to, acquire, one, core, set, in, order, to, play, the, game, which, players, can, further, customize, by, acquiring, extra, sets, or, expansions, featuring, new, content, in, the, form, of, cards, or, scenarios, no, randomization, is, involved, in, the, process, thus, players, that, get, the, same, sets, or, expansions, will, get, the, exact, same, content, the, term, was, popularized, by, fantasy, flight, games, ffg, and, mainly, applies, to, its, products, however, some, tabletop, gaming, companies, can, be, seen, using, a, very, similar, model, a, deck, of, either, customized, dedicated, cards, or, a, standard, deck, of, playing, cards, with, assigned, meanings, is, used, to, simulate, the, actions, of, another, activity, for, example, card, football, many, games, including, card, games, are, fabricated, by, science, fiction, authors, and, screenwriters, to, distance, a, culture, depicted, in, the, story, from, present, day, western, culture, they, are, commonly, used, as, filler, to, depict, background, activities, in, an, atmosphere, like, a, bar, or, rec, room, but, sometimes, the, drama, revolves, around, the, play, of, the, game, some, of, these, games, become, real, card, games, as, the, holder, of, the, intellectual, property, develops, and, markets, a, suitable, deck, and, ruleset, for, the, game, while, others, lack, sufficient, descriptions, of, rules, or, depend, on, cards, or, other, hardware, that, are, infeasible, or, physically, impossible, any, specific, card, game, imposes, restrictions, on, the, number, of, players, the, most, significant, dividing, lines, run, between, one, player, games, and, two, player, games, and, between, two, player, games, and, multi, player, games, card, games, for, one, player, are, known, as, solitaire, or, patience, card, games, see, list, of, solitaire, card, games, generally, speaking, they, are, in, many, ways, special, and, atypical, although, some, of, them, have, given, rise, to, two, or, multi, player, games, such, as, spite, and, malice, in, card, games, for, two, players, usually, not, all, cards, are, distributed, to, the, players, as, they, would, otherwise, have, perfect, information, about, the, game, state, two, player, games, have, always, been, immensely, popular, and, include, some, of, the, most, significant, card, games, such, as, piquet, bezique, sixty, six, klaberjass, gin, rummy, and, cribbage, many, multi, player, games, started, as, two, player, games, that, were, adapted, to, a, greater, number, of, players, for, such, adaptations, a, number, of, non, obvious, choices, must, be, made, beginning, with, the, choice, of, a, game, orientation, one, way, of, extending, a, two, player, game, to, more, players, is, by, building, two, teams, of, equal, size, a, common, case, is, four, players, in, two, fixed, partnerships, sitting, crosswise, as, in, whist, and, contract, bridge, partners, sit, opposite, to, each, other, and, cannot, see, each, other, s, hands, if, communication, between, the, partners, is, allowed, at, all, then, it, is, usually, restricted, to, a, specific, list, of, permitted, signs, and, signals, 17th, century, french, partnership, games, such, as, triomphe, were, special, in, that, partners, sat, next, to, each, other, and, were, allowed, to, communicate, freely, so, long, as, they, did, not, exchange, cards, or, play, out, of, order, another, way, of, extending, a, two, player, game, to, more, players, is, as, a, cut, throat, or, individual, game, in, which, all, players, play, for, themselves, and, win, or, lose, alone, most, such, card, games, are, round, games, i, e, they, can, be, played, by, any, number, of, players, starting, from, two, or, three, so, long, as, there, are, enough, cards, for, all, for, some, of, the, most, interesting, games, such, as, ombre, tarot, and, skat, the, associations, between, players, change, from, hand, to, hand, ultimately, players, all, play, on, their, own, but, for, each, hand, some, game, mechanism, divides, the, players, into, two, teams, most, typically, these, are, solo, games, i, e, games, in, which, one, player, becomes, the, soloist, and, has, to, achieve, some, objective, against, the, others, who, form, a, team, and, win, or, lose, all, their, points, jointly, but, in, games, for, more, than, three, players, there, may, also, be, a, mechanism, that, selects, two, players, who, then, have, to, play, against, the, others, the, players, of, a, card, game, normally, form, a, circle, around, a, table, or, other, space, that, can, hold, cards, the, game, orientation, or, direction, of, play, which, is, only, relevant, for, three, or, more, players, can, be, either, clockwise, or, counterclockwise, it, is, the, direction, in, which, various, roles, in, the, game, proceed, in, real, time, card, games, there, may, be, no, need, for, a, direction, of, play, most, regions, have, a, traditional, direction, of, play, such, as, europe, is, roughly, divided, into, a, clockwise, area, in, the, north, and, a, counterclockwise, area, in, the, south, the, boundary, runs, between, england, ireland, netherlands, germany, austria, mostly, slovakia, ukraine, and, russia, clockwise, and, france, switzerland, spain, italy, slovenia, balkans, hungary, romania, bulgaria, greece, and, turkey, counterclockwise, games, that, originate, in, a, region, with, a, strong, preference, are, often, initially, played, in, the, original, direction, even, in, regions, that, prefer, the, opposite, direction, for, games, that, have, official, rules, and, are, played, in, tournaments, the, direction, of, play, is, often, prescribed, in, those, rules, most, games, have, some, form, of, asymmetry, between, players, the, roles, of, players, are, normally, expressed, in, terms, of, the, dealer, i, e, the, player, whose, task, it, is, to, shuffle, the, cards, and, distribute, them, to, the, players, being, the, dealer, can, be, a, minor, or, major, advantage, or, disadvantage, depending, on, the, game, therefore, after, each, played, hand, the, deal, normally, passes, to, the, next, player, according, to, the, game, orientation, as, it, can, still, be, an, advantage, or, disadvantage, to, be, the, first, dealer, there, are, some, standard, methods, for, determining, who, is, the, first, dealer, a, common, method, is, by, cutting, which, works, as, follows, one, player, shuffles, the, deck, and, places, it, on, the, table, each, player, lifts, a, packet, of, cards, from, the, top, reveals, its, bottom, card, and, returns, it, to, the, deck, the, player, who, reveals, the, highest, or, lowest, card, becomes, dealer, in, the, case, of, a, tie, the, process, is, repeated, by, the, tied, players, for, some, games, such, as, whist, this, process, of, cutting, is, part, of, the, official, rules, and, the, hierarchy, of, cards, for, the, purpose, of, cutting, which, need, not, be, the, same, as, that, used, otherwise, in, the, game, is, also, specified, but, in, general, any, method, can, be, used, such, as, tossing, a, coin, in, case, of, a, two, player, game, drawing, cards, until, one, player, draws, an, ace, or, rolling, dice, a, hand, also, called, a, deal, is, a, unit, of, the, game, that, begins, with, the, dealer, shuffling, and, dealing, the, cards, as, described, below, and, ends, with, the, players, scoring, and, the, next, dealer, being, determined, the, set, of, cards, that, each, player, receives, and, holds, in, his, or, her, hands, is, also, known, as, that, player, s, hand, the, hand, is, over, when, the, players, have, finished, playing, their, hands, most, often, this, occurs, when, one, player, or, all, has, no, cards, left, the, player, who, sits, after, the, dealer, in, the, direction, of, play, is, known, as, eldest, hand, or, in, two, player, games, as, elder, hand, or, forehand, a, game, round, consists, of, as, many, hands, as, there, are, players, after, each, hand, the, deal, is, passed, on, in, the, direction, of, play, i, e, the, previous, eldest, hand, becomes, the, new, dealer, normally, players, score, points, after, each, hand, a, game, may, consist, of, a, fixed, number, of, rounds, alternatively, it, can, be, played, for, a, fixed, number, of, points, in, this, case, it, is, over, with, the, hand, in, which, a, player, reaches, the, target, score, shuffling, is, the, process, of, bringing, the, cards, of, a, pack, into, a, random, order, there, are, a, large, number, of, techniques, with, various, advantages, and, disadvantages, riffle, shuffling, is, a, method, in, which, the, deck, is, divided, into, two, roughly, equal, sized, halves, that, are, bent, and, then, released, so, that, the, cards, interlace, repeating, this, process, several, times, randomizes, the, deck, well, but, the, method, is, harder, to, learn, than, some, others, and, may, damage, the, cards, the, overhand, shuffle, and, the, hindu, shuffle, are, two, techniques, that, work, by, taking, batches, of, cards, from, the, top, of, the, deck, and, reassembling, them, in, the, opposite, order, they, are, easier, to, learn, but, must, be, repeated, more, to, sufficiently, randomize, the, deck, a, method, suitable, for, small, children, consists, in, spreading, the, cards, on, a, large, surface, and, moving, them, around, before, picking, up, the, deck, again, this, is, also, the, most, common, method, for, shuffling, tiles, such, as, dominoes, for, casino, games, that, are, played, for, large, sums, it, is, vital, that, the, cards, be, properly, randomized, but, for, many, games, this, is, less, critical, and, in, fact, player, experience, can, suffer, when, the, cards, are, shuffled, too, well, the, official, skat, rules, stipulate, that, the, cards, are, shuffled, well, but, according, to, a, decision, of, the, german, skat, court, a, one, handed, player, should, ask, another, player, to, do, the, shuffling, rather, than, use, a, shuffling, machine, as, it, would, shuffle, the, cards, too, well, french, belote, rules, go, so, far, as, to, prescribe, that, the, deck, never, be, shuffled, between, hands, the, dealer, takes, all, of, the, cards, in, the, pack, arranges, them, so, that, they, are, in, a, uniform, stack, and, shuffles, them, in, strict, play, the, dealer, then, offers, the, deck, to, the, previous, player, in, the, sense, of, the, game, direction, for, cutting, if, the, deal, is, clockwise, this, is, the, player, to, the, dealer, s, right, if, counterclockwise, it, is, the, player, to, the, dealer, s, left, the, invitation, to, cut, is, made, by, placing, the, pack, face, downward, on, the, table, near, the, player, who, is, to, cut, who, then, lifts, the, upper, portion, of, the, pack, clear, of, the, lower, portion, and, places, it, alongside, normally, the, two, portions, have, about, equal, size, strict, rules, often, indicate, that, each, portion, must, contain, a, certain, minimum, number, of, cards, such, as, three, or, five, the, formerly, lower, portion, is, then, replaced, on, top, of, the, formerly, upper, portion, instead, of, cutting, one, may, also, knock, on, the, deck, to, indicate, that, one, trusts, the, dealer, to, have, shuffled, fairly, the, actual, deal, distribution, of, cards, is, done, in, the, direction, of, play, beginning, with, eldest, hand, the, dealer, holds, the, pack, face, down, in, one, hand, and, removes, cards, from, the, top, of, it, with, his, or, her, other, hand, to, distribute, to, the, players, placing, them, face, down, on, the, table, in, front, of, the, players, to, whom, they, are, dealt, the, cards, may, be, dealt, one, at, a, time, or, in, batches, of, more, than, one, card, and, either, the, entire, pack, or, a, determined, number, of, cards, are, dealt, out, the, undealt, cards, if, any, are, left, face, down, in, the, middle, of, the, table, forming, the, stock, also, called, the, talon, widow, skat, or, kitty, depending, on, the, game, and, region, throughout, the, shuffle, cut, and, deal, the, dealer, should, prevent, the, players, from, seeing, the, faces, of, any, of, the, cards, the, players, should, not, try, to, see, any, of, the, faces, should, a, player, accidentally, see, a, card, other, than, one, s, own, proper, etiquette, would, be, to, admit, this, it, is, also, dishonest, to, try, to, see, cards, as, they, are, dealt, or, to, take, advantage, of, having, seen, a, card, should, a, card, accidentally, become, exposed, visible, to, all, any, player, can, demand, a, redeal, all, the, cards, are, gathered, up, and, the, shuffle, cut, and, deal, are, repeated, or, that, the, card, be, replaced, randomly, into, the, deck, burning, it, and, a, replacement, dealt, from, the, top, to, the, player, who, was, to, receive, the, revealed, card, when, the, deal, is, complete, all, players, pick, up, their, cards, or, hand, and, hold, them, in, such, a, way, that, the, faces, can, be, seen, by, the, holder, of, the, cards, but, not, the, other, players, or, vice, versa, depending, on, the, game, it, is, helpful, to, fan, one, s, cards, out, so, that, if, they, have, corner, indices, all, their, values, can, be, seen, at, once, in, most, games, it, is, also, useful, to, sort, one, s, hand, rearranging, the, cards, in, a, way, appropriate, to, the, game, for, example, in, a, trick, taking, game, it, may, be, easier, to, have, all, one, s, cards, of, the, same, suit, together, whereas, in, a, rummy, game, one, might, sort, them, by, rank, or, by, potential, combinations, normally, communication, between, partners, about, tactics, or, the, cards, in, their, hands, is, forbidden, however, in, a, small, number, of, games, communication, and, or, signaling, is, permitted, and, very, much, part, of, the, play, most, of, these, games, are, very, old, and, often, have, rules, of, play, that, allow, any, card, to, be, played, at, any, time, such, games, include, a, new, card, game, starts, in, a, small, way, either, as, someone, s, invention, or, as, a, modification, of, an, existing, game, those, playing, it, may, agree, to, change, the, rules, as, they, wish, the, rules, that, they, agree, on, become, the, house, rules, under, which, they, play, the, game, a, set, of, house, rules, may, be, accepted, as, valid, by, a, group, of, players, wherever, they, play, as, it, may, also, be, accepted, as, governing, all, play, within, a, particular, house, caf, or, club, when, a, game, becomes, sufficiently, popular, so, that, people, often, play, it, with, strangers, there, is, a, need, for, a, generally, accepted, set, of, rules, this, need, is, often, met, when, a, particular, set, of, house, rules, becomes, generally, recognized, for, example, when, whist, became, popular, in, 18th, century, england, players, in, the, portland, club, agreed, on, a, set, of, house, rules, for, use, on, its, premises, players, in, some, other, clubs, then, agreed, to, follow, the, portland, club, rules, rather, than, go, to, the, trouble, of, codifying, and, printing, their, own, sets, of, rules, the, portland, club, rules, eventually, became, generally, accepted, throughout, england, and, western, cultures, there, is, nothing, static, or, official, about, this, process, for, the, majority, of, games, there, is, no, one, set, of, universal, rules, by, which, the, game, is, played, and, the, most, common, ruleset, is, no, more, or, less, than, that, many, widely, played, card, games, such, as, canasta, and, pinochle, have, no, official, regulating, body, the, most, common, ruleset, is, often, determined, by, the, most, popular, distribution, of, rulebooks, for, card, games, perhaps, the, original, compilation, of, popular, playing, card, games, was, collected, by, edmund, hoyle, a, self, made, authority, on, many, popular, parlor, games, the, u, s, playing, card, company, now, owns, the, eponymous, hoyle, brand, and, publishes, a, series, of, rulebooks, for, various, families, of, card, games, that, have, largely, standardized, the, games, rules, in, countries, and, languages, where, the, rulebooks, are, widely, distributed, however, players, are, free, to, and, often, do, invent, house, rules, to, supplement, or, even, largely, replace, the, standard, rules, if, there, is, a, sense, in, which, a, card, game, can, have, an, official, set, of, rules, it, is, when, that, card, game, has, an, official, governing, body, for, example, the, rules, of, tournament, bridge, are, governed, by, the, world, bridge, federation, and, by, local, bodies, in, various, countries, such, as, the, american, contract, bridge, league, in, the, u, s, and, the, english, bridge, union, in, england, the, rules, of, skat, are, governed, by, the, international, skat, players, association, and, in, germany, by, the, deutscher, skatverband, which, publishes, the, skatordnung, the, rules, of, french, tarot, are, governed, by, the, f, d, ration, fran, aise, de, tarot, the, rules, of, schafkopf, are, laid, down, by, the, schafkopfschule, in, munich, even, in, these, cases, the, rules, must, only, be, followed, at, games, sanctioned, by, these, governing, bodies, or, where, the, tournament, organisers, specify, them, players, in, informal, settings, are, free, to, implement, agreed, supplemental, or, substitute, rules, for, example, in, schafkopf, there, are, numerous, local, variants, sometimes, known, as, impure, schafkopf, and, specified, by, assuming, the, official, rules, and, describing, the, additions, e, g, with, geier, and, bettel, tariff, 5, 10, cents, an, infraction, is, any, action, which, is, against, the, rules, of, the, game, such, as, playing, a, card, when, it, is, not, one, s, turn, to, play, or, the, accidental, exposure, of, a, card, informally, known, as, bleeding, in, many, official, sets, of, rules, for, card, games, the, rules, specifying, the, penalties, for, various, infractions, occupy, more, pages, than, the, rules, specifying, how, to, play, correctly, this, is, tedious, but, necessary, for, games, that, are, played, seriously, players, who, intend, to, play, a, card, game, at, a, high, level, generally, ensure, before, beginning, that, all, agree, on, the, penalties, to, be, used, when, playing, privately, this, will, normally, be, a, question, of, agreeing, house, rules, in, a, tournament, there, will, probably, be, a, tournament, director, who, will, enforce, the, rules, when, required, and, arbitrate, in, cases, of, doubt, if, a, player, breaks, the, rules, of, a, game, deliberately, this, is, cheating, the, rest, of, this, section, is, therefore, about, accidental, infractions, caused, by, ignorance, clumsiness, inattention, etc, as, the, same, game, is, played, repeatedly, among, a, group, of, players, precedents, build, up, about, how, a, particular, infraction, of, the, rules, should, be, handled, for, example, sheila, just, led, a, card, when, it, wasn, t, her, turn, last, week, when, jo, did, that, we, agreed, etc, sets, of, such, precedents, tend, to, become, established, among, groups, of, players, and, to, be, regarded, as, part, of, the, house, rules, sets, of, house, rules, may, become, formalized, as, described, in, the, previous, section, therefore, for, some, games, there, is, a, proper, way, of, handling, infractions, of, the, rules, but, for, many, games, without, governing, bodies, there, is, no, standard, way, of, handling, infractions, in, many, circumstances, there, is, no, need, for, special, rules, dealing, with, what, happens, after, an, infraction, as, a, general, principle, the, person, who, broke, a, rule, should, not, benefit, from, it, and, the, other, players, should, not, lose, by, it, an, exception, to, this, may, be, made, in, games, with, fixed, partnerships, in, which, it, may, be, felt, that, the, partner, s, of, the, person, who, broke, a, rule, should, also, not, benefit, the, penalty, for, an, accidental, infraction, should, be, as, mild, as, reasonable, consistent, with, there, being, a, possible, benefit, to, the, person, responsible, the, oldest, surviving, reference, to, the, card, game, in, world, history, is, from, the, 9th, century, china, when, the, collection, of, miscellanea, at, duyang, written, by, tang, dynasty, writer, su, e, described, princess, tongchang, daughter, of, emperor, yizong, of, tang, playing, the, leaf, game, with, members, of, the, wei, clan, the, family, of, the, princess, s, husband, in, 868, the, song, dynasty, statesman, and, historian, ouyang, xiu, has, noted, that, paper, playing, cards, arose, in, connection, to, an, earlier, development, in, the, book, format, from, scrolls, to, pages, playing, cards, first, appeared, in, europe, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 14th, century, 35, the, earliest, european, references, speak, of, a, saracen, or, moorish, game, called, naib, and, in, fact, an, almost, complete, mamluk, egyptian, deck, of, 52, cards, in, a, distinct, oriental, design, has, survived, from, around, the, same, time, with, the, four, suits, swords, polo, sticks, cups, and, coins, and, the, ranks, king, governor, second, governor, and, ten, to, one, 40f, the, 1430s, in, italy, saw, the, invention, of, the, tarot, deck, a, full, latin, suited, deck, augmented, by, suitless, cards, with, painted, motifs, that, played, a, special, role, as, trumps, tarot, card, games, are, still, played, with, subsets, of, these, decks, in, parts, of, central, europe, a, full, tarot, deck, contains, 14, cards, in, each, suit, low, cards, labeled, 1, 10, and, court, cards, valet, jack, chevalier, cavalier, knight, dame, queen, and, roi, king, plus, the, fool, or, excuse, card, and, 21, trump, cards, in, the, 18th, century, the, card, images, of, the, traditional, italian, tarot, decks, became, popular, in, cartomancy, and, evolved, into, esoteric, decks, used, primarily, for, the, purpose, today, most, tarot, decks, sold, in, north, america, are, the, occult, type, and, are, closely, associated, with, fortune, telling, in, europe, playing, tarot, decks, remain, popular, for, games, and, have, evolved, since, the, 18th, century, to, use, regional, suits, spades, hearts, diamonds, and, clubs, in, france, leaves, hearts, bells, and, acorns, in, germany, as, well, as, other, familiar, aspects, of, the, english, pattern, pack, such, as, corner, card, indices, and, stamped, card, symbols, for, non, court, cards, decks, differ, regionally, based, on, the, number, of, cards, needed, to, play, the, games, the, french, tarot, consists, of, the, full, 78, cards, while, germanic, spanish, and, italian, tarot, variants, remove, certain, values, usually, low, suited, cards, from, the, deck, creating, a, deck, with, as, few, as, 32, cards, the, french, suits, were, introduced, around, 1480, and, in, france, mostly, replaced, the, earlier, latin, suits, of, swords, clubs, cups, and, coins, 43, which, are, still, common, in, spanish, and, portuguese,
