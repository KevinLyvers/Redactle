brandy, is, a, liquor, produced, by, distilling, wine, brandy, generally, contains, 35, 60, alcohol, by, volume, 70, 120, us, proof, and, is, typically, consumed, as, an, after, dinner, digestif, some, brandies, are, aged, in, wooden, casks, others, are, coloured, with, caramel, colouring, to, imitate, the, effect, of, aging, and, some, are, produced, using, a, combination, of, aging, and, colouring, varieties, of, wine, brandy, can, be, found, across, the, winemaking, world, among, the, most, renowned, are, cognac, and, armagnac, from, south, western, france, in, a, broader, sense, the, term, brandy, also, denotes, liquors, obtained, from, the, distillation, of, pomace, yielding, pomace, brandy, or, mash, or, wine, of, any, other, fruit, fruit, brandy, these, products, are, also, called, eau, de, vie, literally, water, of, life, in, french, the, origins, of, brandy, are, tied, to, the, development, of, distillation, while, the, process, was, known, in, classical, times, it, was, not, used, for, significant, beverage, production, until, the, 15th, century, in, the, early, 16th, century, french, brandy, helped, kickstart, the, cross, atlantic, triangle, trade, when, it, took, over, the, central, role, of, the, portuguese, fortified, wine, due, to, its, higher, alcohol, content, and, ease, of, shipping, canoemen, and, guards, on, the, african, side, of, the, trade, were, generally, paid, in, brandy, by, the, late, 17th, century, rum, had, replaced, brandy, as, the, exchange, alcohol, of, choice, in, the, triangle, trade, initially, wine, was, distilled, as, a, preservation, method, and, to, make, it, easier, for, merchants, to, transport, it, is, also, thought, that, wine, was, originally, distilled, to, lessen, the, tax, which, was, assessed, by, volume, the, intent, was, to, add, the, water, removed, by, distillation, back, to, the, brandy, shortly, before, consumption, it, was, discovered, that, after, being, stored, in, wooden, casks, the, resulting, product, improved, over, the, original, distilled, spirit, in, addition, to, removing, water, the, distillation, process, led, to, the, formation, and, decomposition, of, numerous, aromatic, compounds, fundamentally, altering, the, distillate, composition, from, its, source, non, volatile, substances, such, as, pigments, sugars, and, salts, remained, behind, in, the, still, as, a, result, the, distillate, taste, was, often, quite, unlike, the, sources, as, described, in, the, 1728, edition, of, cyclopaedia, the, following, method, was, used, to, distill, brandy, a, cucurbit, was, filled, half, full, of, the, liquor, from, which, brandy, was, to, be, drawn, and, then, raised, with, a, little, fire, until, about, one, sixth, part, was, distilled, or, until, that, which, falls, into, the, receiver, was, entirely, flammable, this, liquor, distilled, only, once, was, called, the, spirit, of, wine, or, brandy, purified, by, another, distillation, or, several, more, this, was, called, spirit, of, wine, rectified, the, second, distillation, was, made, in, balneo, mariae, and, in, a, glass, cucurbit, and, the, liquor, was, distilled, to, about, one, half, the, quantity, this, was, further, rectified, as, long, as, the, operator, thought, it, necessary, to, produce, brandy, to, shorten, these, several, distillations, which, were, long, and, troublesome, a, chemical, instrument, was, invented, that, reduced, them, to, a, single, distillation, a, portion, was, ignited, to, test, the, purity, of, the, rectified, spirit, of, wine, the, liquor, was, good, if, a, fire, consumed, the, entire, contents, without, leaving, any, impurities, behind, another, better, test, involved, putting, a, little, gunpowder, in, the, bottom, of, the, spirit, the, liquor, was, good, if, the, gunpowder, could, ignite, after, the, spirit, was, consumed, by, fire, hence, the, modern, proof, to, describe, alcohol, content, as, most, brandies, have, been, distilled, from, grapes, the, regions, of, the, world, producing, excellent, brandies, have, roughly, paralleled, those, areas, producing, grapes, for, viniculture, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, western, european, markets, including, by, extension, their, overseas, empires, were, dominated, by, french, and, spanish, brandies, and, eastern, europe, was, dominated, by, brandies, from, the, black, sea, region, including, bulgaria, the, crimea, georgia, and, armenia, in, 1877, the, ararat, brandy, brand, was, established, in, yerevan, armenia, it, became, one, of, the, top, brandy, brands, over, time, and, during, the, yalta, conference, winston, churchill, was, so, impressed, with, the, armenian, brandy, dvin, given, to, him, by, joseph, stalin, that, he, asked, for, several, cases, of, it, to, be, sent, to, him, each, year, reportedly, 400, bottles, of, dvin, were, shipped, to, churchill, annually, in, 1884, david, sarajishvili, founded, a, brandy, factory, in, tbilisi, georgia, a, crossroads, for, turkish, central, asian, and, persian, trade, routes, and, a, part, of, the, russian, empire, at, the, time, except, for, a, few, major, producers, brandy, production, and, consumption, tend, to, have, a, regional, character, and, thus, production, methods, significantly, vary, wine, brandy, is, produced, from, a, variety, of, grape, cultivars, a, special, selection, of, cultivars, providing, distinct, aroma, and, character, is, used, for, high, quality, brandies, while, cheaper, ones, are, made, from, whichever, wine, is, available, brandy, is, made, from, so, called, base, wine, which, significantly, differs, from, regular, table, wines, it, is, made, from, early, grapes, to, achieve, higher, acid, concentration, and, lower, sugar, levels, base, wine, generally, contains, smaller, amounts, up, to, 20, mg, l, of, sulphur, than, regular, wines, as, it, creates, undesired, copper, ii, sulfate, in, reaction, with, copper, in, the, pot, stills, the, yeast, sediment, produced, during, the, fermentation, may, or, may, not, be, kept, in, the, wine, depending, on, the, brandy, style, brandy, is, distilled, from, the, base, wine, in, two, phases, first, a, large, part, of, water, and, solids, is, removed, from, the, base, obtaining, so, called, low, wine, a, concentrated, wine, with, 28, 30, abv, in, the, second, stage, low, wine, is, distilled, into, brandy, the, liquid, exits, the, pot, still, in, three, phases, referred, to, as, the, heads, heart, and, tails, respectively, the, first, part, the, head, has, an, alcohol, concentration, of, about, 83, 166, us, proof, and, an, unpleasant, odour, the, weak, portion, on, the, end, the, tail, is, discarded, along, with, the, head, and, they, are, generally, mixed, with, another, batch, of, low, wine, thereby, entering, the, distillation, cycle, again, the, middle, heart, fraction, the, richest, in, aromas, and, flavours, is, preserved, for, later, maturation, distillation, does, not, simply, enhance, the, alcohol, content, of, wine, the, heat, under, which, the, product, is, distilled, and, the, material, of, the, still, usually, copper, cause, chemical, reactions, during, distillation, this, leads, to, the, formation, of, numerous, new, volatile, aroma, components, changes, in, relative, amounts, of, aroma, components, in, the, wine, and, the, hydrolysis, of, components, such, as, esters, brandy, is, usually, produced, in, pot, stills, batch, distillation, but, the, column, still, can, also, be, used, for, continuous, distillation, the, distillate, obtained, in, this, manner, has, a, higher, alcohol, concentration, approximately, 90, abv, and, is, less, aromatic, the, choice, of, the, apparatus, depends, on, the, style, of, brandy, produced, cognac, and, south, african, brandy, are, examples, of, brandy, produced, in, batches, while, many, american, brandies, use, fractional, distillation, in, column, stills, after, distillation, the, unaged, brandy, is, placed, into, oak, barrels, to, mature, usually, brandies, with, a, natural, golden, or, brown, colour, are, aged, in, oak, casks, single, barrel, ageing, some, brandies, particularly, those, from, spain, are, aged, using, the, solera, system, where, the, producer, changes, the, barrel, each, year, after, a, period, of, ageing, which, depends, on, the, style, class, and, legal, requirements, the, mature, brandy, is, mixed, with, distilled, water, to, reduce, alcohol, concentration, and, bottled, some, brandies, have, caramel, colour, and, sugar, added, to, simulate, the, appearance, of, barrel, ageing, brandy, is, traditionally, served, at, room, temperature, neat, from, a, snifter, a, wine, glass, or, a, tulip, glass, when, drunk, at, room, temperature, it, is, often, slightly, warmed, by, holding, the, glass, cupped, in, the, palm, or, by, gentle, heating, excessive, heating, of, brandy, may, cause, the, alcohol, vapour, to, become, too, strong, causing, its, aroma, to, become, overpowering, brandy, drinkers, who, like, their, brandy, warmed, may, ask, for, the, glass, to, be, heated, before, the, brandy, is, poured, brandy, may, be, added, to, other, beverages, to, make, several, popular, cocktails, these, include, the, brandy, sour, the, brandy, alexander, the, sidecar, the, brandy, daisy, and, the, brandy, old, fashioned, anglo, indian, usage, has, brandy, pawnee, brandy, with, water, brandy, is, a, common, deglazing, liquid, used, in, making, pan, sauces, for, steak, and, other, meat, it, creates, a, more, intense, flavour, in, some, soups, notably, onion, soup, in, english, christmas, cooking, brandy, is, a, common, flavouring, in, traditional, foods, such, as, christmas, cake, brandy, butter, and, christmas, pudding, it, is, also, commonly, used, in, drinks, such, as, mulled, wine, and, eggnog, drunk, during, the, festive, season, brandy, is, used, to, flamb, dishes, such, as, cr, pe, suzette, and, cherries, jubilee, while, serving, brandy, is, traditionally, poured, over, a, christmas, pudding, and, set, alight, before, serving, the, use, of, flamb, can, retain, as, much, as, 75, of, the, alcohol, in, the, brandy, in, the, 19th, century, brandy, was, often, used, as, medical, treatment, due, to, its, alleged, stimulating, qualities, it, was, also, used, by, many, european, explorers, of, tropical, africa, who, suggested, that, regular, moderate, doses, of, brandy, might, help, a, traveller, to, cope, with, fever, depression, and, stress, these, views, fell, out, of, favour, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, with, suggestions, that, people, were, using, brandy, s, medical, qualities, as, an, excuse, for, social, drinking, the, term, brandy, is, a, shortening, of, the, archaic, english,
