veal, is, the, meat, of, calves, in, contrast, to, the, beef, from, older, cattle, veal, can, be, produced, from, a, calf, of, either, sex, and, any, breed, however, most, veal, comes, from, young, male, calves, of, dairy, breeds, which, are, not, used, for, breeding, generally, veal, is, more, expensive, by, weight, than, beef, from, older, cattle, veal, production, is, a, way, to, add, value, to, dairy, bull, calves, and, to, utilize, whey, solids, a, byproduct, from, the, manufacturing, of, cheese, there, are, several, types, of, veal, and, terminology, varies, by, country, similar, terms, are, used, in, the, us, including, calf, bob, intermediate, milk, fed, and, special, fed, in, italian, french, and, other, mediterranean, cuisines, veal, is, often, in, the, form, of, cutlets, such, as, the, italian, cotoletta, or, the, famous, austrian, dish, wiener, schnitzel, some, classic, french, veal, dishes, include, fried, escalopes, fried, veal, grenadines, small, thick, fillet, steaks, stuffed, paupiettes, roast, joints, and, blanquettes, because, veal, is, lower, in, fat, than, many, meats, care, must, be, taken, in, preparation, to, ensure, that, it, does, not, become, tough, veal, is, often, coated, in, preparation, for, frying, or, eaten, with, a, sauce, veal, parmigiana, is, a, common, italian, american, dish, made, with, breaded, veal, cutlets, in, addition, to, providing, meat, the, bones, of, calves, are, used, to, make, a, stock, that, forms, the, base, for, sauces, and, soups, such, as, demi, glace, calf, stomachs, are, also, used, to, produce, rennet, which, is, used, in, the, production, of, cheese, calf, offal, is, also, widely, regarded, as, the, most, prized, animal, offal, male, dairy, calves, are, commonly, used, for, veal, production, as, they, do, not, lactate, and, are, therefore, surplus, to, the, requirements, of, the, dairy, industry, newborn, veal, calves, are, generally, separated, from, the, cow, within, three, days, calves, are, sometimes, raised, in, individual, stalls, for, the, first, several, weeks, as, a, sort, of, quarantine, and, then, moved, to, groupings, of, two, or, more, calves, milk, fed, veal, calves, consume, a, diet, consisting, of, milk, replacer, formulated, with, mostly, milk, based, proteins, and, added, vitamins, and, minerals, supplemented, with, solid, feeds, this, type, of, diet, is, similar, to, infant, formula, and, is, also, one, of, the, most, common, diets, used, for, calves, in, the, veal, industry, grain, fed, calves, normally, consume, a, diet, of, milk, replacer, for, the, first, six, to, eight, weeks, and, then, move, on, to, a, mostly, corn, based, diet, a, farm, veterinarian, creates, and, provides, a, health, program, for, the, herd, veal, calves, need, proper, amounts, of, water, adequate, nutrition, and, safe, and, comfortable, environments, to, thrive, veal, production, has, been, a, controversial, topic, the, ethics, of, veal, production, have, been, challenged, by, animal, welfare, advocates, and, some, methods, are, cited, as, animal, cruelty, by, multiple, animal, welfare, organizations, these, organizations, and, some, of, their, members, consider, several, practices, and, procedures, of, veal, production, to, be, inhumane, public, efforts, by, these, organizations, are, placing, pressure, on, the, veal, industry, to, change, some, of, its, methods, some, of, these, practices, are, relevant, to, both, group, and, individual, housing, systems, in, the, past, one, aspect, of, veal, production, cited, as, cruelty, in, the, industry, was, the, lack, of, space, veal, calves, were, provided, space, was, often, deliberately, restricted, by, the, producer, to, stop, the, animal, from, exercising, as, exercise, was, thought, to, make, the, meat, turn, redder, and, tougher, modern, veal, production, facilities, in, the, us, allow, sufficient, room, for, the, calf, to, lie, down, stand, stretch, and, groom, itself, some, systems, of, veal, production, rear, calves, that, are, denied, access, to, any, solid, feed, and, are, fed, a, liquid, milk, replacer, they, may, also, be, deprived, of, bedding, to, prevent, them, from, eating, it, this, dietary, restriction, completely, distorts, the, normal, development, of, the, rumen, and, predisposes, the, calf, to, infectious, enteritis, scouring, or, diarrhea, and, chronic, indigestion, furthermore, calves, with, an, underdeveloped, gut, are, more, likely, to, be, found, to, have, hairballs, in, the, rumen, at, slaughter, the, accumulation, of, hairballs, in, the, rumen, can, impair, digestion, rearing, calves, in, deprived, conditions, without, a, teat, can, lead, to, the, development, of, abnormal, oral, behaviour, some, of, these, may, develop, into, oral, stereotypies, such, as, sucking, licking, or, biting, inanimate, objects, and, by, tongue, rolling, and, tongue, playing, purposeless, oral, activity, occupies, 15, of, the, time, in, crated, calves, but, only, 2, 3, in, group, housed, calves, veal, calves, dietary, intake, of, iron, was, restricted, to, achieve, a, target, haemoglobin, concentration, of, around, 4, 6, mmol, l, normal, concentration, of, haemoglobin, in, the, blood, is, greater, than, 7, mmol, l, calves, with, blood, haemoglobin, concentrations, of, below, 4, 5, mmol, l, may, show, signs, of, increased, disease, susceptibility, and, immunosuppression, alternative, agricultural, uses, for, male, dairy, calves, include, raising, bob, veal, generally, slaughtered, at, 2, 3, days, old, though, age, may, be, as, young, as, 2, hours, or, at, most, 1, month, old, raising, calves, as, red, veal, without, the, severe, dietary, restrictions, needed, to, create, pale, meat, requiring, fewer, antibiotic, treatments, and, resulting, in, lower, calf, mortality, and, as, dairy, beef, in, 2008, to, 2009, in, the, us, the, demand, for, free, raised, veal, rose, rapidly, veal, crates, are, a, close, confinement, system, of, raising, veal, calves, many, calves, raised, for, veal, including, in, canada, and, the, us, were, confined, in, crates, which, typically, measure, approximately, 66, 76, cm, 2, ft, 2, in, 2, ft, 6, in, wide, the, calves, were, housed, individually, and, the, crates, may, prevent, physical, contact, between, adjacent, calves, and, sometimes, also, visual, contact, in, the, past, crated, calves, were, often, tied, to, the, front, of, the, crate, with, a, tether, which, restricted, movement, floors, were, often, slatted, and, sloped, allowing, urine, and, manure, to, fall, under, the, crate, to, help, maintain, a, clean, environment, for, the, calf, in, some, veal, crate, systems, the, calves, were, also, kept, in, the, dark, without, bedding, and, fed, nothing, but, milk, veal, crates, were, designed, to, limit, movement, of, the, animal, because, it, was, believed, by, producers, that, the, meat, turns, redder, and, tougher, if, the, animals, were, allowed, to, exercise, the, diet, was, sometimes, highly, regulated, to, control, sources, of, iron, which, again, makes, the, meat, redder, in, the, us, the, use, of, tethers, in, veal, crates, to, prevent, movement, by, veal, calves, was, a, principal, source, of, controversy, in, veal, farming, many, veal, farmers, started, improving, conditions, in, their, veal, farms, in, the, 2000s, veal, tethering, is, criticized, because, the, ability, of, the, calves, to, move, is, highly, restricted, the, crates, may, have, unsuitable, flooring, the, calves, spend, their, entire, lives, indoors, experience, prolonged, sensory, social, and, exploratory, deprivation, and, the, calves, are, more, susceptible, to, high, amounts, of, stress, and, disease, all, milk, fed, veal, calves, in, the, us, are, now, untethered, and, are, raised, in, groups, by, at, least, ten, weeks, of, age, if, not, earlier, calves, need, to, exercise, to, ensure, normal, bone, and, muscle, development, calves, at, pasture, not, only, walk, but, also, run, about, jump, and, play, calves, in, veal, crates, cannot, turn, around, walk, or, run, this, results, in, calves, that, may, stumble, or, have, difficulty, walking, when, finally, taken, for, slaughter, there, is, a, general, increase, in, knee, and, hock, swelling, as, crate, width, decreases, under, natural, conditions, calves, continue, to, suckle, 3, to, 6, times, a, day, for, up, to, 5, months, veal, crates, prevented, this, social, interaction, furthermore, some, calves, were, reared, in, crates, with, solid, walls, that, prevented, visual, or, tactile, contact, with, their, neighbours, it, has, been, shown, that, calves, will, work, for, social, contact, with, other, calves, to, maintain, personal, hygiene, and, help, prevent, disease, calves, lick, themselves, to, groom, cattle, naturally, lick, all, the, parts, of, their, body, they, can, reach, however, tethering, prevents, calves, from, licking, the, hind, parts, of, their, body, excessive, licking, of, the, forelegs, another, abnormal, behaviour, is, common, in, stall, and, tether, systems, in, the, us, young, milk, fed, veal, calves, may, be, raised, in, individual, pens, up, to, a, maximum, of, ten, weeks, of, age, and, are, typically, in, visual, and, tactile, contact, with, their, neighbors, milk, fed, veal, calves, are, never, tethered, allowing, them, to, easily, groom, themselves, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, regulations, do, not, permit, the, use, of, hormones, on, veal, calves, for, any, reason, they, do, however, permit, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, veal, raising, to, treat, or, prevent, disease, in, 2004, the, usda, expressed, concern, that, the, use, of, illegal, drugs, might, be, widespread, in, the, veal, industry, in, 2004, a, usda, official, found, a, lump, on, a, veal, calf, in, a, wisconsin, veal, farm, which, turned, out, to, be, an, illegal, hormone, implant, in, 2004, the, usda, stated, that, penicillin, is, not, used, in, calf, raising, tetracycline, has, been, approved, but, is, not, widely, used, in, 1990, the, british, government, banned, transporting, calves, in, close, confinement, crates, veal, crates, were, banned, across, the, european, union, eu, in, january, 2007, veal, calf, production, as, such, is, not, allowed, in, many, northern, european, countries, such, as, in, finland, in, finland, giving, feed, drink, or, other, nutrition, which, is, known, to, be, dangerous, to, an, animal, which, is, being, cared, for, is, prohibited, as, well, as, failing, to, give, nutrients, the, lack, of, which, is, known, to, cause, the, animal, to, fall, ill, the, finnish, animal, welfare, act, of, 1996, and, the, finnish, animal, welfare, decree, of, 1996, provided, general, guidelines, for, the, housing, and, care, of, animals, and, effectively, banned, veal, crates, in, finland, veal, crates, are, not, specifically, banned, in, switzerland, but, most, calves, are, raised, outdoors, in, 2007, the, american, veal, association, passed, a, resolution, encouraging, the, entire, industry, to, phase, out, tethered, crate, confinement, of, calves, by, 2017, a, goal, that, was, met, by, all, milk, fed, veal, farmers, as, of, 2015, eight, u, s, states, ban, tethering, of, calves, in, veal, crates, nationally, several, large, veal, producers, and, the, american, veal, association, are, also, working, to, phase, out, the, industry, use, of, tethered, veal, crates, as, of, 2017, all, american, veal, association, members, are, raising, calves, in, tether, free, pens, and, all, veal, calves, are, housed, in, group, pens, by, the, time, they, are, 10, weeks, of, age, state, by, state, veal, crate, bans, are, as, follows, current, active, legislation, in
