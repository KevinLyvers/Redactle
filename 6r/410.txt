sea, or, lake, competitive, swimming, is, one, of, the, most, popular, olympic, sports, with, varied, distance, events, in, butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and, individual, medley, in, addition, to, these, individual, events, four, swimmers, can, take, part, in, either, a, freestyle, or, medley, relay, a, medley, relay, consists, of, four, swimmers, who, will, each, swim, a, different, stroke, ordered, as, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and, freestyle, swimming, each, stroke, requires, a, set, of, specific, techniques, in, competition, there, are, distinct, regulations, concerning, the, acceptable, form, for, each, individual, stroke, there, are, also, regulations, on, what, types, of, swimsuits, caps, jewelry, and, injury, tape, that, are, allowed, at, competitions, although, it, is, possible, for, competitive, swimmers, to, incur, several, injuries, from, the, sport, such, as, tendinitis, in, the, shoulders, or, knees, there, are, also, multiple, health, benefits, associated, with, the, sport, evidence, of, recreational, swimming, in, prehistoric, times, has, been, found, with, the, earliest, evidence, dating, to, stone, age, paintings, from, around, 10, 000, years, ago, written, references, date, from, 2000, bc, with, some, of, the, earliest, references, to, swimming, including, the, iliad, the, odyssey, the, bible, beowulf, the, quran, and, others, in, 1538, nikolaus, wynmann, a, swiss, german, professor, of, languages, wrote, the, earliest, known, complete, book, about, swimming, colymbetes, sive, de, arte, natandi, dialogus, et, festivus, et, iucundus, lectu, the, swimmer, or, a, dialogue, on, the, art, of, swimming, and, joyful, and, pleasant, to, read, swimming, emerged, as, a, competitive, recreational, activity, in, the, 1830s, in, england, in, 1828, the, first, indoor, swimming, pool, st, george, s, baths, was, opened, to, the, public, by, 1837, the, national, swimming, society, was, holding, regular, swimming, competitions, in, six, artificial, swimming, pools, built, around, london, the, recreational, activity, grew, in, popularity, and, by, 1880, when, the, first, national, governing, body, the, amateur, swimming, association, was, formed, there, were, already, over, 300, regional, clubs, in, operation, across, the, country, in, 1844, two, native, american, participants, at, a, swimming, competition, in, london, introduced, the, front, crawl, to, a, european, audience, sir, john, arthur, trudgen, picked, up, the, hand, over, stroke, from, some, south, american, natives, and, successfully, debuted, the, new, stroke, in, 1873, winning, a, local, competition, in, england, his, stroke, is, still, regarded, as, the, most, powerful, to, use, today, captain, matthew, webb, was, the, first, man, to, swim, the, english, channel, between, england, and, france, in, 1875, using, the, breaststroke, technique, he, swam, the, channel, 21, 26, miles, 34, 21, km, in, 21, hours, and, 45, minutes, his, feat, was, not, replicated, or, surpassed, for, the, next, 36, years, until, t, w, burgess, made, the, crossing, in, 1911, other, european, countries, also, established, swimming, federations, germany, in, 1882, france, in, 1890, and, hungary, in, 1896, the, first, european, amateur, swimming, competitions, were, in, 1889, in, vienna, the, world, s, first, women, s, swimming, championship, was, held, in, scotland, in, 1892, men, s, swimming, became, part, of, the, first, modern, olympic, games, in, 1896, in, athens, in, 1902, the, australian, richmond, cavill, introduced, freestyle, to, the, western, world, in, 1908, the, world, swimming, association, f, d, ration, internationale, de, natation, fina, was, formed, women, s, swimming, was, introduced, into, the, olympics, in, 1912, the, first, international, swim, meet, for, women, outside, the, olympics, was, the, 1922, women, s, olympiad, butterfly, was, developed, in, the, 1930s, and, was, at, first, a, variant, of, breaststroke, until, it, was, accepted, as, a, separate, style, in, 1952, fina, renamed, itself, world, aquatics, in, december, 2022, competitive, swimming, became, popular, in, the, 19th, century, the, goal, of, high, level, competitive, swimming, is, to, break, personal, or, world, records, while, beating, competitors, in, any, given, event, swimming, in, competition, should, create, the, least, resistance, in, order, to, obtain, maximum, speed, however, some, professional, swimmers, who, do, not, hold, a, national, or, world, ranking, are, considered, the, best, in, regard, to, their, technical, skills, typically, an, athlete, goes, through, a, cycle, of, training, in, which, the, body, is, overloaded, with, work, in, the, beginning, and, middle, segments, of, the, cycle, and, then, the, workload, is, decreased, in, the, final, stage, as, the, swimmer, approaches, competition, the, practice, of, reducing, exercise, in, the, days, just, before, an, important, competition, is, called, tapering, tapering, is, used, to, give, the, swimmer, s, body, some, rest, without, stopping, exercise, completely, a, final, stage, is, often, referred, to, as, shave, and, taper, the, swimmer, shaves, off, all, exposed, hair, for, the, sake, of, reducing, drag, and, having, a, sleeker, and, more, hydrodynamic, feel, in, the, water, additionally, the, shave, and, taper, method, refers, to, the, removal, of, the, top, layer, of, dead, skin, which, exposes, the, newer, and, richer, skin, underneath, this, also, helps, to, shave, off, mere, milliseconds, on, your, time, swimming, is, an, event, at, the, summer, olympic, games, where, male, and, female, athletes, compete, in, 16, of, the, recognized, events, each, olympic, events, are, held, in, a, 50, meter, pool, called, a, long, course, pool, there, are, forty, officially, recognized, individual, swimming, events, in, the, pool, however, the, international, olympic, committee, only, recognizes, 32, of, them, the, international, governing, body, for, competitive, swimming, is, world, aquatics, which, was, known, until, 2023, as, the, f, d, ration, internationale, de, natation, international, swimming, federation, or, fina, in, open, water, swimming, where, the, events, are, swum, in, a, body, of, open, water, lake, or, sea, there, are, also, 5, km, 10, km, and, 25, km, events, for, men, and, women, however, only, the, 10, km, event, is, included, in, the, olympic, schedule, again, for, both, men, and, women, pool, and, open, water, competitions, are, typically, separate, events, except, at, the, world, championships, and, the, olympics, in, competitive, swimming, four, major, styles, have, been, established, these, have, been, relatively, stable, over, the, last, 30, to, 40, years, with, minor, improvements, they, are, in, competition, only, one, of, these, styles, may, be, used, except, in, the, case, of, the, individual, medley, or, im, which, consists, of, all, four, in, this, latter, event, swimmers, swim, equal, distances, of, butterfly, then, backstroke, breaststroke, and, finally, freestyle, in, olympic, competition, this, event, is, swum, in, two, distances, 200, and, 400, meters, some, short, course, competitions, also, include, the, 100, yard, or, 100, meter, im, particularly, for, younger, or, newer, swimmers, typically, under, 14, years, involved, in, club, swimming, or, masters, swimming, over, 18, since, the, 1990s, the, most, drastic, change, in, swimming, has, been, the, addition, of, the, underwater, dolphin, kick, this, is, used, to, maximize, the, speed, at, the, start, and, after, the, turns, in, all, styles, david, berkoff, became, the, first, to, use, it, successfully, at, the, 1988, olympics, he, swam, most, of, the, 100, m, backstroke, race, underwater, and, broke, the, world, record, in, the, distance, during, the, preliminaries, another, swimmer, to, use, the, technique, was, denis, pankratov, at, the, 1996, olympics, in, atlanta, where, he, completed, almost, half, of, the, 100, m, butterfly, underwater, to, win, the, gold, medal, the, dolphin, kick, was, rarely, used, in, freestyle, sprint, races, until, 2008, when, technical, swimsuits, were, introduced, to, the, sport, at, the, european, short, course, championships, in, rijeka, croatia, technical, suited, amaury, leveaux, set, world, records, of, 44, 94, seconds, in, the, 100, m, freestyle, 20, 48, seconds, in, the, 50, m, freestyle, and, 22, 18, in, the, 50, m, butterfly, spending, more, than, half, of, each, race, submerged, more, than, any, of, his, competitors, subsequently, fina, made, a, rule, that, swimmers, may, not, go, farther, than, 15, metres, underwater, in, 2014, fina, rules, that, a, single, dolphin, kick, may, be, added, to, the, breaststroke, pullout, before, the, first, breaststroke, kick, in, the, past, decade, american, competitive, swimmers, have, made, the, most, use, of, the, underwater, dolphin, kick, notably, olympic, and, world, medal, winners, michael, phelps, and, ryan, lochte, world, championship, pools, must, be, 50, metres, 160, ft, long, course, long, and, 25, metres, 82, ft, wide, with, ten, lanes, labelled, zero, to, nine, or, one, to, ten, in, some, pools, zero, and, nine, or, one, and, ten, are, usually, left, empty, in, semi, finals, and, finals, the, lanes, must, be, at, least, 2, 5, metres, 8, 2, ft, wide, they, will, be, equipped, with, starting, blocks, at, both, ends, of, the, pool, and, most, will, have, automatic, officiating, equipment, including, touch, pads, to, record, times, and, sensors, to, ensure, the, legality, of, relay, takeovers, the, pool, must, have, a, minimum, depth, of, two, metres, other, pools, which, host, events, under, world, aquatics, regulations, are, required, to, meet, some, but, not, all, of, these, requirements, many, of, these, pools, have, eight, or, even, six, instead, of, ten, lanes, and, some, will, be, 25, metres, 82, ft, long, making, them, short, course, world, records, that, are, set, in, short, course, pools, are, kept, separate, from, those, set, in, long, course, pools, because, it, may, be, an, advantage, or, disadvantage, to, swimmers, to, have, more, or, less, turns, in, a, race, due, to, waves, created, by, the, swimmers, it, can, be, an, advantage, to, swim, closer, to, the, center, of, the, pool, during, a, race, due, to, this, world, aquatics, regulations, specify, which, lane, each, swimmer, competes, in, based, on, previous, times, in, a, ten, lane, pool, this, is, as, follows, competitive, swimming, from, the, club, through, to, international, level, tends, to, have, an, autumn, and, winter, season, competing, in, short, course, 25, metres, or, yards, pools, and, a, spring, and, summer, season, competing, in, long, course, 50, metre, pools, and, in, open, water, in, international, competition, and, in, club, swimming, in, europe, the, short, course, 25m, season, lasts, from, september, to, december, and, the, long, course, 50m, season, from, january, to, august, with, open, water, in, the, summer, months, these, regulations, are, slowly, being, brought, to, competition, in, north, america, as, of, right, now, in, club, school, and, college, swimming, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, short, course, 25, yards, season, is, much, longer, from, september, to, march, the, long, course, season, takes, place, in, 50, meter, pools, and, lasts, from, april, to, the, end, of, august, with, open, water, in, the, summer, months, in, club, swimming, in, australasia, the, short, course, 25m, season, lasts, from, april, to, september, and, the, long, course, 50m, season, from, october, to, march, with, open, water, in, the, summer, months, outside, the, united, states, meters, is, the, standard, in, both, short, and, long, course, swimming, with, the, same, distances, swum, in, all, events, in, the, american, short, course, season, the, 500, yard, 1000, yard, and, 1650, yard, freestyle, events, are, swum, as, a, yard, is, much, shorter, than, a, meter, 100, yards, equals, 91, 44, meters, while, during, the, american, long, course, season, the, 400, meter, 800, meter, and, 1500, meter, freestyle, events, are, swum, instead, beginning, each, swimming, season, racing, in, short, course, allows, for, shorter, distance, races, for, novice, swimmers, for, example, in, the, short, course, season, if, a, swimmer, wanted, to, compete, in, a, stroke, they, had, just, learned, a, 25, yard, meter, race, is, available, to, them, opposed, to, the, long, course, season, when, they, would, need, to, be, able, to, swim, at, least, 50, meters, of, that, new, stroke, in, order, to, compete, there, are, several, types, of, officials, which, are, needed, to, manage, the, competition, referee, the, referee, has, full, control, and, authority, over, all, officials, the, referee, will, enforce, all, rules, and, decisions, of, world, aquatics, and, shall, have, the, final, answer, to, all, questions, relating, to, the, actual, conduct, of, anything, regarding, the, meet, as, well, as, the, final, settlement, of, which, is, not, otherwise, covered, by, the, rules, the, referee, takes, overall, responsibility, for, running, the, meet, and, makes, the, final, decisions, as, to, who, wins, each, race, referees, call, swimmers, to, the, blocks, with, short, blasts, of, their, whistles, this, is, the, signal, for, the, swimmers, to, stand, next, to, their, blocks, then, the, referee, will, blow, a, long, whistle, that, will, tell, the, swimmers, to, step, on, the, block, for, backstroke, events, the, long, whistle, is, the, signal, for, the, swimmers, to, jump, into, the, water, the, referee, will, then, blow, another, long, whistle, signalling, the, swimmers, to, grab, the, gutter, or, the, provided, block, handle, finally, the, referee, will, hand, over, the, rest, to, the, starter, by, directing, their, hand, to, the, starter, starter, the, starter, has, full, control, of, the, swimmers, from, the, time, the, referee, turns, the, swimmers, over, to, them, until, the, race, commences, a, starter, begins, the, race, by, saying, take, your, mark, at, this, point, the, swimmers, will, get, into, stationary, positions, sometimes, known, as, point, zero, in, which, they, would, like, to, start, their, race, after, all, swimmers, have, assumed, their, stationary, position, the, starter, will, push, a, button, on, the, starting, system, signaling, the, start, of, a, race, with, a, loud, noise, usually, a, beep, or, a, horn, and, flash, from, a, strobe, light, a, starter, sends, the, swimmers, off, the, blocks, and, may, call, a, false, start, if, a, swimmer, leaves, the, block, before, the, starter, sends, them, a, starter, may, also, choose, to, recall, the, race, after, the, start, for, any, reason, or, request, the, swimmers, to, stand, relax, or, step, down, if, they, believe, that, a, particular, swimmer, s, has, obtained, an, unfair, advantage, at, the, start, clerk, of, course, the, clerk, of, course, also, called, the, bullpen, assembles, swimmers, before, each, event, and, organizes, seeds, swimmers, into, heats, based, on, their, times, heats, are, generally, seeded, from, slowest, to, fastest, where, swimmers, with, no, previous, time, for, an, event, are, assumed, to, be, the, slowest, the, clerk, of, the, course, is, also, responsible, for, recording, and, reporting, swimmers, who, have, chosen, to, scratch, not, swim, their, events, after, they, have, signed, up, or, qualified, to, a, semifinal, or, final, the, clerk, is, also, responsible, for, enforcing, rules, of, the, swim, meet, if, a, swimmer, chooses, to, not, show, up, no, show, ns, or, did, not, swim, dns, to, their, events, timekeepers, each, timekeeper, takes, the, time, of, the, swimmers, in, the, lane, assigned, to, them, unless, a, video, backup, system, is, used, it, may, be, necessary, to, use, the, full, complement, of, timekeepers, even, when, automatic, officiating, equipment, is, used, a, chief, timekeeper, assigns, the, seating, positions, for, all, timekeepers, and, the, lanes, for, which, they, are, responsible, in, most, competitions, there, will, be, one, or, more, timekeepers, per, lane, in, international, competitions, where, full, automatic, timing, and, video, placing, equipment, is, in, use, timekeepers, may, not, be, required, inspectors, of, turns, one, inspector, of, turns, is, assigned, to, one, or, more, lanes, at, each, end, of, the, pool, each, inspector, of, turns, ensures, that, swimmers, comply, with, the, relevant, rules, for, turning, as, well, as, the, relevant, rules, for, start, and, finish, of, the, race, inspectors, of, turns, shall, report, any, violation, on, disqualification, reports, detailing, the, event, lane, number, and, the, infringement, delivered, to, the, chief, inspector, of, turns, who, will, immediately,

made, the, initial, disqualification, report, brands, such, as, arena, speedo, tyr, and, adidas, are, popular, regular, swimwear, brands, the, most, durable, material, for, regular, swimming, is, polyester, the, main, difference, between, competition, and, regular, swimwear, is, that, competition, swimwear, is, tighter, and, compresses, the, muscles, of, the, swimmers, regular, swimwear, is, easier, to, put, on, and, more, comfortable, for, leisure, activities, the, most, used, practice, swimwear, for, men, includes, briefs, and, jammers, males, generally, swim, barechested, there, was, controversy, after, the, beijing, olympic, games, in, 2008, when, many, olympic, swimmers, broke, records, an, unprecedented, number, of, times, using, revolutionary, swimsuits, that, covered, their, entire, legs, to, highlight, the, issue, in, 2008, 70, world, records, were, broken, in, one, year, and, 66, olympic, records, were, broken, in, one, olympic, games, there, were, races, in, beijing, where, the, first, five, finishers, were, swimming, faster, than, the, old, world, record, as, of, 1, january, 2010, men, are, only, allowed, to, wear, suits, from, the, waist, to, the, knees, they, are, also, only, permitted, to, wear, one, piece, of, swimwear, they, cannot, wear, briefs, underneath, jammers, this, rule, was, enacted, after, the, controversy, in, the, beijing, olympics, and, rome, world, championships, women, wear, one, piece, suits, with, thicker, and, higher, backs, for, competition, though, two, piece, suits, can, also, be, worn, during, practice, backs, vary, mainly, in, strap, thickness, and, geometric, design, most, common, styles, include, racerback, axel, back, corset, diamondback, and, butterfly, back, fly, back, there, are, also, different, style, lengths, three, quarter, length, reaches, the, knees, regular, length, shoulders, to, hips, and, bikini, style, two, piece, as, of, 1, january, 2010, in, competition, women, must, wear, suits, that, do, not, go, past, the, shoulders, or, knees, drag, suits, are, used, to, increase, water, resistance, against, the, swimmer, to, help, them, train, for, competitions, other, forms, of, drag, wear, include, nylons, old, suits, and, t, shirts, articles, that, increase, friction, in, the, water, to, build, strength, during, training, and, thus, increase, speed, once, drag, items, are, removed, for, competition, some, swimmers, practice, in, basketball, shorts, over, their, bathing, suit, wearing, two, bathing, suits, or, wearing, an, extra, bathing, suit, with, holes, cut, in, the, material, many, swimmers, also, shave, areas, of, exposed, skin, before, end, of, season, competitions, to, reduce, friction, in, the, water, the, practice, gained, popularity, after, the, 1956, olympics, when, murray, rose, and, jon, henricks, came, shaved, and, won, gold, medals, for, australia, freshly, shaven, skin, is, less, resistant, when, in, the, water, in, addition, a, 1989, study, demonstrated, that, shaving, improves, a, swimmer, s, overall, performance, by, reducing, drag, the, disadvantages, of, using, a, drag, suit, include, the, depletion, of, proper, stroke, this, is, caused, by, the, swimmer, s, own, fatigue, when, the, swimmer, becomes, more, fatigued, different, muscle, groups, become, more, tired, consequently, the, swimmer, will, try, to, engage, another, group, of, muscle, to, do, the, same, thing, which, can, cause, the, stroke, efficiency, to, drop, elite, and, international, swimming, comprises, the, highest, level, of, competition, available, to, swimmers, including, competitions, such, as, the, olympic, games, and, the, world, aquatics, championships, swimming, creates, a, mix, of, levels, including, fully, professional, semi, professional, and, amateur, fully, professional, swimmers, will, typically, get, a, salary, both, from, their, national, governing, body, and, from, outside, sponsors, semi, professionals, a, small, stipend, from, their, national, governing, body, and, amateurs, receive, no, funding, outside, of, these, major, championships, prize, money, is, low, the, 2015, fina, world, cup, series, has, a, total, prize, fund, of, 3, 000, per, race, shared, between, the, top, three, and, the, 2014, 15, usa, grand, prix, series, 1, 800, compared, to, the, 2015, world, aquatics, championships, fund, of, 60, 000, per, race, shared, between, the, top, eight, open, water, swimming, is, swimming, outside, a, regular, pool, usually, in, a, lake, or, sometimes, ocean, popularity, of, the, sport, has, grown, in, recent, years, particularly, since, the, 10, km, open, water, event, was, added, as, an, olympic, event, in, 2005, contested, for, the, first, time, in, the, 2008, olympic, games, in, beijing, new, recent, technology, has, developed, much, faster, swimsuits, full, body, suits, have, been, banned, but, swimmers, at, the, very, top, levels, still, wear, suits, that, have, been, lasered, together, because, stitching, creates, drag, the, disadvantage, of, these, suits, is, that, they, are, often, uncomfortable, and, tight, and, can, tear, easily, if, not, handled, carefully, the, largest, ocean, swim, s, in, terms, of, numbers, of, participants, are, in, australia, with, the, pier, to, pub, cole, classic, and, melbourne, swim, classic, all, with, roughly, 5000, swimming, participants, swimming, times, have, dropped, over, the, years, due, to, superior, training, techniques, and, new, technical, developments, the, first, four, olympics, were, not, held, in, pools, but, in, open, water, 1896, the, mediterranean, 1900, the, seine, river, 1904, an, artificial, lake, 1906, the, mediterranean, the, 1904, olympics, freestyle, race, was, the, only, one, ever, measured, at, 100, yards, instead, of, the, usual, 100, meters, a, 100, meter, pool, was, built, for, the, 1908, olympics, and, sat, in, the, center, of, the, main, stadium, s, track, and, field, oval, the, 1912, olympics, held, in, the, stockholm, harbor, marked, the, beginning, of, electronic, timing, male, swimmers, wore, full, body, suits, until, the, 1940s, which, caused, more, drag, in, the, water, than, their, modern, swimwear, counterparts, experience, competition, suits, now, include, engineered, fabric, and, designs, to, reduce, swimmers, drag, in, the, water, and, prevent, athlete, fatigue, in, addition, over, the, years, pool, designs, have, lessened, the, drag, some, design, considerations, allow, for, the, reduction, of, swimming, resistance, making, the, pool, faster, these, include, proper, pool, depth, elimination, of, currents, increased, lane, width, energy, absorbing, racing, lane, lines, and, gutters, and, the, use, of, other, innovative, hydraulic, acoustic, and, illumination, designs, there, have, been, major, changes, in, starting, blocks, over, the, past, years, starting, blocks, used, to, be, small, narrow, and, straight, but, through, time, they, have, become, bigger, and, wider, and, nowadays, the, surface, of, the, block, is, angled, towards, the, swimming, pool, in, addition, starting, blocks, now, have, a, wedge, which, is, a, raised, slanting, platform, situated, at, the, rear, of, the, main, block, this, enables, the, swimmer, to, adopt, a, crouched, position, at, a, 90, degrees, angle, and, push, off, quicker, with, the, rear, leg, to, increase, their, launch, power, the, 1924, summer, olympics, were, the, first, to, use, the, standard, 50, meter, pool, with, marked, lanes, in, the, freestyle, swimmers, originally, dove, from, the, pool, walls, but, diving, blocks, were, incorporated, at, the, 1936, summer, olympics, the, tumble, turn, was, developed, by, the, 1950s, and, goggles, were, first, used, in, the, 1976, olympics, there, were, also, changes, in, the, late, 20th, century, in, terms, of, technique, breaststrokers, are, now, allowed, to, dip, their, heads, completely, under, water, to, glide, which, allows, for, a, longer, stroke, and, faster, time, however, the, breaststrokers, must, bring, their, heads, up, at, the, completion, of, each, cycle, in, addition, a, key, hole, pull, in, the, breaststroke, start, and, turns, has, been, added, to, help, speed, up, the, stroke, now, off, the, start, and, turns, breaststrokers, are, allowed, one, butterfly, kick, to, help, increase, their, speed, this, change, was, made, official, in, december, 2014, backstrokers, are, now, allowed, to, turn, on, their, stomachs, before, the, wall, in, order, to, perform, a, flip, turn, previously, they, had, to, reach, and, flip, backwards, and, a, variation, of, it, known, as, a, bucket, turn, or, a, suicide, turn, is, sometimes, used, in, individual, medley, events, to, transition, from, backstroke, to, breaststroke, the, foundation, of, fina, in, 1908, signaled, the, commencement, of, recording, the, first, official, world, records, in, swimming, at, that, time, records, could, be, established, in, any, swimming, pool, of, length, not, less, than, 25, yards, and, records, were, also, accepted, for, intermediate, distance, split, times, from, long, distance, events, today, world, records, will, only, be, accepted, when, times, are, reported, by, automatic, officiating, equipment, or, semi, automatic, officiating, equipment, in, the, case, of, automatic, officiating, equipment, system, malfunction, records, in, events, such, as, 300, yd, 300, m, 1000, yd, and, 1000, m, freestyle, 400, m, backstroke, and, 400, m, and, 500, m, breaststroke, were, no, longer, ratified, from, 1948, a, further, removal, of, the, 500, yd, and, 500, m, freestyle, 150, m, backstroke, and, 3, 100, m, medley, relay, from, the, record, listings, occurred, in, 1952, in, 1952, the, national, federations, of, the, united, states, and, japan, proposed, at, the, fina, congress, the, separation, of, records, achieved, in, long, course, and, short, course, pools, however, it, was, four, more, years, before, action, came, into, effect, with, the, congress, deciding, to, retain, only, records, held, in, 50, m, pools, as, the, official, world, record, listings, by, 1969, there, were, thirty, one, events, in, which, fina, recognised, official, world, records, 16, for, men, 15, for, women, closely, resembling, the, event, schedule, that, was, in, use, at, the, olympic, games, the, increase, in, accuracy, and, reliability, of, electronic, timing, equipment, led, to, the, introduction, of, hundredths, of, a, second, to, the, time, records, from, 21, august, 1972, until, 3, march, 1991, world, records, in, short, course, 25, m, pools, were, noted, as, world, best, times, wbts, but, not, as, short, course, world, records, on, 31, october, 1994, times, in, 50, m, backstroke, breaststroke, and, butterfly, were, added, to, the, official, record, listings, fina, currently, recognises, world, records, in, these, events, for, both, men, and, women, denotes, instances, that, cannot, be, determined, swimming, is, a, healthy, activity, that, can, be, done, by, most, people, throughout, their, life, it, is, a, low, impact, workout, that, has, several, mental, and, bodily, health, benefits, all, while, being, a, good, recreational, activity, swimming, builds, endurance, muscle, strength, and, cardiovascular, fitness, correspondingly, it, also, improves, weight, loss, while, being, a, safer, alternative, of, working, out, for, someone, who, is, injured, or, for, women, who, are, pregnant, swimming, generally, requires, less, effort, than, many, other, sports, while, still, providing, similar, physical, benefits, the, u, s, census, bureau, reports, that, two, and, a, half, hours, per, week, of, aerobic, physical, activity, such, as, swimming, can, decrease, the, risk, of, chronic, illnesses, and, help, regenerate, healthy, cells, furthermore, swimming, is, linked, to, better, cognitive, function, also, lowering, the, risk, of, type, ii, diabetes, high, blood, pressure, and, a, stroke, it, can, improve, lung, and, heart, strength, while, it, tones, muscles, in, a, full, body, workout, people, can, typically, exercise, longer, in, water, than, on, land, without, increased, effort, and, minimal, joint, or, muscle, pain, when, in, the, water, the, body, undergoes, less, physical, stress, thus, releasing, pressure, from, the, joints, in, addition, to, the, physical, benefits, of, swimming, lower, stress, levels, and, occurrences, of, depression, and, anxiety, are, known, to, decrease, while, swimming, swimming, is, a, meditation, sport, meaning, there, is, an, increase, of, blood, flow, to, the, brain, which, allows, an, individual, to, evaluate, stressors, more, calmly, for, those, with, dementia, swimming, has, a, number, of, positive, benefits, such, as, reducing, anxiety, and, agitation, provides, opportunities, to, socialize, and, contributes, to, a, positive, sense, of, self, worth, perhaps, the, most, common, injury, to, swimmers, is, repeated, trauma, and, overuse, of, the, rotator, cuff, in, the, shoulder, the, joints, are, more, prone, to, injury, when, the, arm, is, repetitively, used, in, a, position, above, the, horizontal, line, of, the, body, this, position, occurs, in, each, of, the, four, swimming, strokes, in, every, cycle, of, the, arms, out, of, the, four, tendons, in, the, rotator, cuff, the, supraspinatus, is, most, prone, to, tearing, rotator, cuff, impingement, is, due, to, pressure, on, the, rotator, cuff, from, part, of, the, scapula, as, the, arm, is, raised, the, best, way, to, prevent, injury, is, catching, the, issue, early, typically, poor, technique, and, over, excessive, use, of, the, muscle, group, can, be, the, primary, causes, of, injury, through, communication, between, swimmers, coaches, parents, and, medical, professionals, problems, can, be, diagnosed, before, a, serious, injury, additionally, proper, warm, up, stretches, and, strength, training, exercises, should, be, completed, before, any, rigorous, movements, in, treating, a, rotator, cuff, injury, the, most, important, factor, is, time, due, to, the, nature, of, the, joint, being, primarily, stabilized, by, muscle, and, tendon, the, injury, must, be, fully, healed, to, prevent, recurrence, returning, to, swimming, or, other, demanding, exercises, too, soon, can, result, in, degeneration, of, a, tendon, which, might, result, in, a, rupture, during, the, rehabilitation, period, focus, should, be, placed, on, rotator, cuff, and, scapular, strengthening, another, common, injury, is, breaststroke, knee, also, known, as, swimmer, s, knee, this, injury, is, caused, by, the, kicking, movement, used, while, swimming, breaststroke, the, kicking, movement, will, cause, wear, and, tear, on, the, knee, and, it, will, eventually, lead, to, constant, pain, in, recent, studies, it, has, been, found, that, initially, the, pain, is, only, experienced, when, the, kick, was, executed, but, eventually, the, pain, spread, to, other, regular, day, to, day, activities, athletic, and, non, athletic
