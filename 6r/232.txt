asexuality, is, the, lack, of, sexual, attraction, to, others, or, low, or, absent, interest, in, or, desire, for, sexual, activity, it, may, be, considered, a, sexual, orientation, or, the, lack, thereof, it, may, also, be, categorized, more, widely, to, include, a, broad, spectrum, of, asexual, sub, identities, asexuality, is, distinct, from, abstention, from, sexual, activity, and, from, celibacy, which, are, behavioral, and, generally, motivated, by, factors, such, as, an, individual, s, personal, social, or, religious, beliefs, sexual, orientation, unlike, sexual, behavior, is, believed, to, be, enduring, some, asexual, people, engage, in, sexual, activity, despite, lacking, sexual, attraction, or, a, desire, for, sex, for, a, number, of, reasons, such, as, a, desire, to, physically, pleasure, themselves, or, romantic, partners, or, a, desire, to, have, children, acceptance, of, asexuality, as, a, sexual, orientation, and, field, of, scientific, research, is, still, relatively, new, as, a, growing, body, of, research, from, both, sociological, and, psychological, perspectives, has, begun, to, develop, while, some, researchers, assert, that, asexuality, is, a, sexual, orientation, other, researchers, disagree, asexual, individuals, may, represent, about, one, percent, of, the, population, various, asexual, communities, have, started, to, form, since, the, impact, of, the, internet, and, social, media, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, most, prolific, and, well, known, of, these, communities, is, the, asexual, visibility, and, education, network, which, was, founded, in, 2001, by, david, jay, because, there, is, significant, variation, among, those, who, identify, as, asexual, the, term, asexuality, can, encompass, broad, definitions, researchers, generally, define, asexuality, as, the, lack, of, sexual, attraction, or, the, lack, of, interest, in, sexual, activity, though, specific, definitions, vary, the, term, may, be, used, to, refer, to, individuals, with, low, or, absent, sexual, behavior, or, exclusively, romantic, non, sexual, partnerships, in, addition, to, low, or, absent, sexual, desire, or, attraction, the, asexual, visibility, and, education, network, aven, an, online, forum, dedicated, to, asexuality, defines, an, asexual, as, someone, who, does, not, experience, sexual, attraction, as, well, as, adding, that, asexuality, at, its, core, is, just, a, word, that, people, use, to, help, figure, themselves, out, and, encourages, people, to, use, the, term, asexual, to, define, themselves, as, long, as, it, makes, sense, to, do, so, asexuality, is, often, abbreviated, as, ace, a, phonetic, shortening, of, asexual, and, the, community, as, a, whole, is, likewise, referred, to, as, the, ace, community, despite, lacking, sexual, attraction, some, asexuals, might, engage, in, purely, romantic, relationships, while, others, may, not, some, who, identify, as, asexual, report, that, they, experience, sexual, attraction, though, lack, the, inclination, to, act, on, it, citing, no, desire, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, some, asexuals, also, lack, the, desire, to, engage, in, non, sexual, physical, activity, such, as, cuddling, or, hand, holding, while, others, choose, to, do, so, asexual, people, may, seek, relationships, without, romantic, or, sexual, activity, known, as, queerplatonic, relationships, a, squish, is, a, term, used, by, the, asexual, community, to, describe, a, non, sexual, crush, certain, asexuals, may, participate, in, sexual, activity, out, of, curiosity, some, may, also, masturbate, as, a, form, of, solitary, release, while, others, may, not, feel, a, need, to, do, so, the, desire, for, masturbation, or, other, sexual, activity, is, often, referred, to, as, sex, drive, by, asexuals, who, disassociate, it, from, sexual, attraction, and, being, asexual, asexuals, who, masturbate, generally, consider, it, to, be, a, normal, product, of, the, human, body, rather, than, a, sign, of, latent, sexuality, and, others, do, not, find, it, pleasurable, some, asexual, men, are, unable, to, get, an, erection, and, are, unable, to, attempt, penetration, asexuals, also, differ, in, their, views, on, performing, sexual, acts, some, are, indifferent, and, may, engage, in, sexual, activity, for, the, benefit, of, a, romantic, partner, while, others, are, more, strongly, averse, to, the, idea, though, they, are, not, typically, against, sex, as, a, whole, many, who, identify, as, asexual, may, identify, with, diverse, gender, identities, or, classifications, of, romantic, orientation, these, are, often, integrated, with, a, person, s, asexual, identity, and, asexuals, may, still, identify, as, heterosexual, lesbian, gay, or, bisexual, regarding, romantic, or, emotional, aspects, of, sexual, orientation, or, sexual, identity, in, addition, to, identifying, as, asexual, the, romantic, aspects, of, sexual, orientations, may, also, be, indicated, by, a, variety, of, romantic, identities, including, biromantic, heteroromantic, homoromantic, or, panromantic, and, those, who, do, not, experience, romantic, attraction, may, identify, as, aromantic, this, split, between, romantic, and, sexual, orientation, is, commonly, explained, as, the, split, attraction, model, which, states, that, romantic, and, sexual, attraction, are, not, strictly, linked, for, all, people, individuals, who, are, both, aromantic, and, asexual, are, sometimes, known, as, aro, ace, or, aroace, the, term, gray, asexuality, refers, to, the, spectrum, between, asexuality, and, non, asexuality, also, referred, to, as, allosexuality, individuals, who, identify, as, gray, asexual, may, occasionally, experience, sexual, attraction, or, only, experience, sexual, attraction, as, a, secondary, component, once, a, reasonably, stable, or, large, emotional, connection, has, been, formed, with, the, target, known, as, demisexuality, most, scholars, agree, that, asexuality, is, rare, constituting, 1, or, less, of, the, population, asexuality, is, not, a, new, aspect, of, human, sexuality, but, it, is, relatively, new, to, public, discourse, in, comparison, to, other, sexualities, asexuality, has, received, little, attention, from, the, scientific, community, with, quantitative, information, pertaining, to, the, prevalence, of, asexuality, low, in, numbers, s, e, smith, of, the, guardian, is, not, sure, asexuality, has, actually, increased, rather, leaning, towards, the, belief, that, it, is, simply, more, visible, alfred, kinsey, rated, individuals, from, 0, to, 6, according, to, their, sexual, orientation, from, heterosexual, to, homosexual, known, as, the, kinsey, scale, he, also, included, a, category, he, called, x, for, individuals, with, no, socio, sexual, contacts, or, reactions, although, in, modern, times, this, is, categorized, as, representing, asexuality, scholar, justin, j, lehmiller, stated, the, kinsey, x, classification, emphasized, a, lack, of, sexual, behavior, whereas, the, modern, definition, of, asexuality, emphasizes, a, lack, of, sexual, attraction, as, such, the, kinsey, scale, may, not, be, sufficient, for, accurate, classification, of, asexuality, kinsey, labeled, 1, 5, of, the, adult, male, population, as, x, in, his, second, book, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, he, reported, this, breakdown, of, individuals, who, are, x, unmarried, females, 14, 19, married, females, 1, 3, previously, married, females, 5, 8, unmarried, males, 3, 4, married, males, 0, and, previously, married, males, 1, 2, further, empirical, data, about, an, asexual, demographic, appeared, in, 1994, when, a, research, team, in, the, united, kingdom, carried, out, a, comprehensive, survey, of, 18, 876, british, residents, spurred, by, the, need, for, sexual, information, in, the, wake, of, the, aids, pandemic, the, survey, included, a, question, on, sexual, attraction, to, which, 1, 05, of, the, respondents, replied, that, they, had, never, felt, sexually, attracted, to, anyone, at, all, the, study, of, this, phenomenon, was, continued, by, canadian, sexuality, researcher, anthony, bogaert, in, 2004, who, explored, the, asexual, demographic, in, a, series, of, studies, bogaert, s, research, indicated, that, 1, of, the, british, population, does, not, experience, sexual, attraction, but, he, believed, that, the, 1, figure, was, not, an, accurate, reflection, of, the, likely, much, larger, percentage, of, the, population, that, could, be, identified, as, asexual, noting, that, 30, of, people, contacted, for, the, initial, survey, chose, not, to, participate, in, the, survey, since, less, sexually, experienced, people, are, more, likely, to, refuse, to, participate, in, studies, about, sexuality, and, asexuals, tend, to, be, less, sexually, experienced, than, allosexuals, it, is, likely, that, asexuals, were, under, represented, in, the, responding, participants, the, same, study, found, the, number, of, homosexuals, and, bisexuals, combined, to, be, about, 1, 1, of, the, population, which, is, much, smaller, than, other, studies, indicate, contrasting, bogaert, s, 1, figure, a, study, by, aicken, et, al, published, in, 2013, suggests, that, based, on, natsal, 2, data, from, 2000, to, 2001, the, prevalence, of, asexuality, in, britain, is, only, 0, 4, for, the, age, range, 16, 44, this, percentage, indicates, a, decrease, from, the, 0, 9, figure, determined, from, the, natsal, 1, data, collected, on, the, same, age, range, a, decade, earlier, a, 2015, analysis, by, bogaert, also, found, a, similar, decline, between, the, natsal, 1, and, natsal, 2, data, aicken, mercer, and, cassell, found, some, evidence, of, ethnic, differences, among, respondents, who, had, not, experienced, sexual, attraction, both, men, and, women, of, indian, and, pakistani, origin, had, a, higher, likelihood, of, reporting, a, lack, of, sexual, attraction, in, a, survey, conducted, by, yougov, in, 2015, 1, 632, british, adults, were, asked, to, try, to, place, themselves, on, the, kinsey, scale, 1, of, participants, answered, no, sexuality, the, breakdown, of, participants, was, 0, men, 2, women, 1, across, all, age, ranges, there, is, significant, debate, over, whether, or, not, asexuality, is, a, sexual, orientation, it, has, been, compared, and, equated, with, hypoactive, sexual, desire, disorder, hsdd, a, diagnosis, which, was, in, the, dsm, 4, in, that, both, imply, a, general, lack, of, sexual, attraction, to, anyone, hsdd, has, been, used, to, medicalize, asexuality, but, asexuality, is, generally, not, considered, a, disorder, or, a, sexual, dysfunction, such, as, anorgasmia, anhedonia, etc, because, it, does, not, necessarily, define, someone, as, having, a, medical, problem, or, problems, relating, to, others, socially, unlike, people, with, hsdd, asexual, people, normally, do, not, experience, marked, distress, and, interpersonal, difficulty, concerning, feelings, about, their, sexuality, or, generally, a, lack, of, sexual, arousal, asexuality, is, considered, the, lack, or, absence, of, sexual, attraction, as, a, life, enduring, characteristic, one, study, found, that, compared, to, hsdd, subjects, asexuals, reported, lower, levels, of, sexual, desire, sexual, experience, sex, related, distress, and, depressive, symptoms, researchers, richards, and, barker, report, that, asexuals, do, not, have, disproportionate, rates, of, alexithymia, depression, or, personality, disorders, some, people, however, may, identify, as, asexual, even, if, their, non, sexual, state, is, explained, by, one, or, more, of, the, aforementioned, disorders, since, the, release, of, the, dsm, 5, in, 2013, which, split, hsdd, into, diagnoses, for, female, sexual, arousal, disorder, and, male, hypoactive, sexual, desire, disorder, both, disorders, have, been, criticised, for, similar, issues, to, hsdd, although, the, dsm, 5, mentions, asexuality, as, an, exclusion, criterion, for, these, two, disorders, it, is, necessary, for, individuals, to, self, identify, as, asexual, to, meet, the, differential, diagnosis, and, this, requirement, has, been, criticised, for, imposing, a, diagnosis, on, people, who, are, possibly, asexual, but, do, not, yet, identify, as, such, as, of, 2021, hsdd, continues, to, be, used, to, describe, transgender, women, the, first, study, that, gave, empirical, data, about, asexuals, was, published, in, 1983, by, paula, nurius, concerning, the, relationship, between, sexual, orientation, and, mental, health, 689, subjects, most, of, whom, were, students, at, various, universities, in, the, united, states, taking, psychology, or, sociology, classes, were, given, several, surveys, including, four, clinical, well, being, scales, results, showed, that, asexuals, were, more, likely, to, have, low, self, esteem, and, more, likely, to, be, depressed, than, members, of, other, sexual, orientations, 25, 88, of, heterosexuals, 26, 54, bisexuals, called, ambisexuals, 29, 88, of, homosexuals, and, 33, 57, of, asexuals, were, reported, to, have, problems, with, self, esteem, a, similar, trend, existed, for, depression, nurius, did, not, believe, that, firm, conclusions, can, be, drawn, from, this, for, a, variety, of, reasons, in, a, 2013, study, yule, et, al, looked, into, mental, health, variances, between, caucasian, heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and, asexuals, the, results, of, 203, male, and, 603, female, participants, were, included, in, the, findings, yule, et, al, found, that, asexual, male, participants, were, more, likely, to, report, having, a, mood, disorder, than, other, males, particularly, in, comparison, to, the, heterosexual, participants, the, same, was, found, for, female, asexual, participants, over, their, heterosexual, counterparts, however, non, asexual, non, heterosexual, females, had, the, highest, rates, asexual, participants, of, both, sexes, were, more, likely, to, have, anxiety, disorders, than, heterosexual, and, non, heterosexual, participants, as, were, they, more, likely, than, heterosexual, participants, to, report, having, had, recent, suicidal, feelings, yule, et, al, hypothesized, that, some, of, these, differences, may, be, due, to, discrimination, and, other, societal, factors, with, regard, to, sexual, orientation, categories, asexuality, may, be, argued, as, not, being, a, meaningful, category, to, add, to, the, continuum, and, instead, argued, as, the, lack, of, a, sexual, orientation, or, sexuality, other, arguments, propose, that, asexuality, is, the, denial, of, one, s, natural, sexuality, and, that, it, is, a, disorder, caused, by, shame, of, sexuality, anxiety, or, sexual, abuse, sometimes, basing, this, belief, on, asexuals, who, masturbate, or, occasionally, engage, in, sexual, activity, simply, to, please, a, romantic, partner, within, the, context, of, sexual, orientation, identity, politics, asexuality, may, pragmatically, fulfill, the, political, function, of, a, sexual, orientation, identity, category, the, suggestion, that, asexuality, is, a, sexual, dysfunction, is, controversial, among, the, asexual, community, those, who, identify, as, asexual, usually, prefer, it, to, be, recognized, as, a, sexual, orientation, scholars, who, argue, that, asexuality, is, a, sexual, orientation, may, point, to, the, existence, of, different, sexual, preferences, they, and, many, asexual, people, believe, that, the, lack, of, sexual, attraction, is, valid, enough, to, be, categorized, as, a, sexual, orientation, the, researchers, argue, that, asexuals, do, not, choose, to, have, no, sexual, desire, and, generally, start, to, find, out, their, differences, in, sexual, behaviors, around, adolescence, because, of, these, facts, coming, to, light, it, is, reasoned, that, asexuality, is, more, than, a, behavioral, choice, and, is, not, something, that, can, be, cured, like, a, disorder, there, is, also, analysis, on, whether, identifying, as, asexual, is, becoming, more, popular, research, on, the, etiology, of, sexual, orientation, when, applied, to, asexuality, has, the, definitional, problem, of, sexual, orientation, not, consistently, being, defined, by, researchers, as, including, asexuality, while, heterosexuality, homosexuality, and, bisexuality, are, usually, but, not, always, determined, during, the, early, years, of, preadolescent, life, it, is, not, known, when, asexuality, is, determined, it, is, unclear, whether, these, characteristics, are, thought, to, be, lifelong, or, if, they, may, be, acquired, one, criterion, usually, taken, to, be, defining, of, a, sexual, orientation, is, that, it, is, stable, over, time, in, a, 2016, analysis, in, the, archives, of, sexual, behavior, brotto, et, al, found, only, weak, support, for, this, criterion, being, met, among, asexual, individuals, an, analysis, of, data, from, the, national, longitudinal, study, of, adolescent, to, adult, health, by, stephen, cranney, found, that, of, 14, individuals, who, reported, no, sexual, attraction, in, the, study, s, third, wave, when, subjects, ranged, in, age, from, 18, to, 26, only, 3, continued, to, identify, in, this, way, at, the, fourth, wave, six, years, later, however, cranney, notes, that, asexual, identification, in, the, third, wave, was, still, significant, as, a, predictor, of, asexual, identification, in, the, subsequent, wave, in, a, subsequent, commentary, cranney, stated, that, the, interpretation, of, this, data, was, complicated, by, the, absence, of, any, set, quantitative, standard, for, how, long, a, sexual, desire, must, last, before, it, is, considered, stable, or, intrinsic, enough, to, be, considered, an, orientation, while, some, asexuals, masturbate, as, a, solitary, form, of, release, or, have, sex, for, the, benefit, of, a, romantic, partner, others, do, not, see, above, fischer, et, al, reported, that, scholars, who, study, the, physiology, around, asexuality, suggest, that, people, who, are, asexual, are, capable, of, genital, arousal, but, may, experience, difficulty, with, so, called, subjective, arousal, this, means, that, while, the, body, becomes, aroused, subjectively, at, the, level, of, the, mind, and, emotions, one, does, not, experience, arousal, the, kinsey, institute, sponsored, another, small, survey, on, the, topic, in, 2007, which, found, that, self, identified, asexuals, reported, significantly, less, desire, for, sex, with, a, partner, lower, sexual, arousability, and, lower, sexual, excitation, but, did, not, differ, consistently, from, non, asexuals, in, their, sexual, inhibition, scores, or, their, desire, to, masturbate, a, 1977, paper, titled, asexual, and, autoerotic, women, two, invisible, groups, by, myra, t, johnson, is, explicitly, devoted, to, asexuality, in, humans, johnson, defines, asexuals, as, those, men, and, women, who, regardless, of, physical, or, emotional, condition, actual, sexual, history, and, marital, status, or, ideological, orientation, seem, to, prefer, not, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, she, contrasts, autoerotic, women, with, asexual, women, the, asexual, woman, has, no, sexual, desires, at, all, the, autoerotic, woman, recognizes, such, desires, but, prefers, to, satisfy, them, alone, johnson, s, evidence, is, mostly, letters, to, the, editor, found, in, women, s, magazines, written, by, asexual, autoerotic, women, she, portrays, them, as, invisible, oppressed, by, a, consensus, that, they, are, non, existent, and, left, behind, by, both, the, sexual, revolution, and, the, feminist, movement, johnson, argued, that, society, either, ignores, or, denies, their, existence, or, insists, they, must, be, ascetic, for, religious, reasons, neurotic, or, asexual, for, political, reasons, in, a, study, published, in, 1979, in, volume, five, of, advances, in, the, study, of, affect, as, well, as, in, another, article, using, the, same, data, and, published, in, 1980, in, the, journal, of, personality, and, social, psychology, michael, d, storms, of, the, university, of, kansas, outlined, his, own, reimagining, of, the, kinsey, scale, whereas, kinsey, measured, sexual, orientation, based, on, a, combination, of, actual, sexual, behavior, and, fantasizing, and, eroticism, storms, used, only, fantasizing, and, eroticism, storms, however, placed, hetero, eroticism, and, homo, eroticism, on, separate, axes, rather, than, at, two, ends, of, a, single, scale, this, allows, for, a, distinction, between, bisexuality, exhibiting, both, hetero, and, homo, eroticism, in, degrees, comparable, to, hetero, or, homosexuals, respectively, and, asexuality, exhibiting, a, level, of, homo, eroticism, comparable, to, a, heterosexual, and, a, level, of, hetero, eroticism, comparable, to, a, homosexual, namely, little, to, none, this, type, of, scale, accounted, for, asexuality, for, the, first, time, storms, conjectured, that, many, researchers, following, kinsey, s, model, could, be, mis, categorizing, asexual, subjects, as, bisexual, because, both, were, simply, defined, by, a, lack, of, preference, for, gender, in, sexual, partners, in, a, 1983, study, by, paula, nurius, which, included, 689, subjects, most, of, whom, were, students, at, various, universities, in, the, united, states, taking, psychology, or, sociology, classes, the, two, dimensional, fantasizing, and, eroticism, scale, was, used, to, measure, sexual, orientation, based, on, the, results, respondents, were, given, a, score, ranging, from, 0, to, 100, for, hetero, eroticism, and, from, 0, to, 100, for, homo, eroticism, respondents, who, scored, lower, than, 10, on, both, were, labeled, asexual, this, consisted, of, 5, of, the, males, and, 10, of, the, females, results, showed, that, asexuals, reported, much, lower, frequency, and, desired, frequency, of, a, variety, of, sexual, activities, including, having, multiple, partners, anal, sexual, activities, having, sexual, encounters, in, a, variety, of, locations, and, autoerotic, activities, the, field, of, asexuality, studies, is, still, emerging, as, a, subset, of, the, broader, field, of, gender, and, sexuality, studies, notable, researchers, who, have, produced, significant, works, in, asexuality, studies, include, kj, cerankowski, ela, przybylo, and, cj, deluzio, chasin, a, 2010, paper, written, by, kj, cerankowski, and, megan, milks, titled, new, orientations, asexuality, and, its, implications, for, theory, and, practice, suggests, that, asexuality, may, be, somewhat, of, a, question, in, itself, for, the, studies, of, gender, and, sexuality, cerankowski, and, milks, have, suggested, that, asexuality, raises, many, more, questions, than, it, resolves, such, as, how, a, person, could, abstain, from, having, sex, which, is, generally, accepted, by, society, to, be, the, most, basic, of, instincts, their, new, orientations, paper, states, that, society, has, deemed, female, sexuality, as, empowered, or, repressed, the, asexual, movement, challenges, that, assumption, by, challenging, many, of, the, basic, tenets, of, pro, sex, feminism, already, defined, as, repressive, or, anti, sex, sexualities, in, addition, to, accepting, self, identification, as, asexual, the, asexual, visibility, and, education, network, has, formulated, asexuality, as, a, biologically, determined, orientation, this, formula, if, dissected, scientifically, and, proven, would, support, researcher, simon, levay, s, blind, study, of, the, hypothalamus, in, gay, men, women, and, straight, men, which, indicates, that, there, is, a, biological, difference, between, straight, men, and, gay, men, in, 2014, cerankowski, and, milks, edited, and, published, asexualities, feminist, and, queer, perspectives, a, collection, of, essays, intended, to, explore, the, politics, of, asexuality, from, a, feminist, and, queer, perspective, it, is, broken, into, the, introduction, and, then, six, parts, theorizing, asexuality, new, orientations, the, politics, of, asexuality, visualizing, asexuality, in, media, culture, asexuality, and, masculinity, health, disability, and, medicalization, and, reading, asexually, asexual, literary, theory, each, part, contains, two, to, three, papers, on, a, given, aspect, of, asexuality, research, one, such, paper, is, written, by, ela, przybylo, another, name, that, is, becoming, common, in, asexual, scholarly, literature, her, article, with, regard, to, the, cerankowski, and, milks, anthology, focuses, on, accounts, by, self, identified, male, asexuals, with, a, particular, focus, on, the, pressures, men, experience, towards, having, sex, in, dominant, western, discourse, and, media, three, men, living, in, southern, ontario, canada, were, interviewed, in, 2011, and, przybylo, admits, that, the, small, sample, size, means, that, her, findings, cannot, be, generalized, to, a, greater, population, in, terms, of, representation, and, that, they, are, exploratory, and, provisional, especially, in, a, field, that, is, still, lacking, in, theorizations, all, three, interviewees, addressed, being, affected, by, the, stereotype, that, men, have, to, enjoy, and, want, sex, in, order, to, be, real, men, another, of, przybylo, s, works, asexuality, and, the, feminist, politics, of, not, doing, it, published, in, 2011, takes, a, feminist, lens, to, scientific, writings, on, asexuality, pryzyblo, argues, that, asexuality, is, made, possible, only, through, the, western, context, of, sexual, coital, and, heterosexual, imperatives, she, addresses, earlier, works, by, dana, densmore, valerie, solanas, and, breanne, fahs, who, argued, for, asexuality, and, celibacy, as, radical, feminist, political, strategies, against, patriarchy, while, przybylo, does, make, some, distinctions, between, asexuality, and, celibacy, she, considers, blurring, the, lines, between, the, two, to, be, productive, for, a, feminist, understanding, of, the, topic, in, her, 2013, article, producing, facts, empirical, asexuality, and, the, scientific, study, of, sex, przybylo, distinguishes, between, two, different, stages, of, asexual, research, that, of, the, late, 1970s, to, the, early, 1990s, which, often, included, a, very, limited, understanding, of, asexuality, and, the, more, recent, revisiting, of, the, subject, which, she, says, began, with, bogaert, s, 2004, study, and, has, popularized, the, subject, and, made, it, more, culturally, visible, in, this, article, przybylo, once, again, asserts, the, understanding, of, asexuality, as, a, cultural, phenomenon, and, continues, to, be, critical, of, its, scientific, study, pryzblo, published, a, book, asexual, erotics, in, 2019, in, this, book, she, argued, that, asexuality, poses, a, paradox, in, that, is, a, sexual, orientation, that, is, defined, by, the, absence, of, sexual, activity, entirely, she, distinguishes, between, a, sociological, understanding, of, asexuality, and, a, cultural, understanding, which, she, said, could, include, the, open, mesh, of, possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances, and, resonances, cj, deluzio, chasin, states, in, reconsidering, asexuality, and, its, radical, potential, that, academic, research, on, asexuality, has, positioned, asexuality, in, line, with, essentialist, discourses, of, sexual, orientation, which, is, troublesome, as, it, creates, a, binary, between, asexuals, and, persons, who, have, been, subjected, to, psychiatric, intervention, for, disorders, such, as, hypoactive, sexual, desire, disorder, chasin, says, that, this, binary, implies, that, all, asexuals, experience, a, lifelong, hence, enduring, lack, of, sexual, attraction, that, all, non, asexuals, who, experience, a, lack, of, sexual, desire, experience, distress, over, it, and, that, it, pathologizes, asexuals, who, do, experience, such, distress, as, chasin, says, such, diagnoses, as, hsdd, act, to, medicalize, and, govern, women, s, sexuality, the, article, aims, to, unpack, problematic, definitions, of, asexuality, that, are, harmful, to, both, asexuals, and, women, alike, chasin, states, that, asexuality, has, the, power, to, challenge, commonplace, discourse, of, the, naturalness, of, sexuality, but, that, the, unquestioned, acceptance, of, its, current, definition, does, not, allow, for, this, chasin, also, argues, there, and, elsewhere, in, making, sense, in, and, of, the, asexual, community, navigating, relationships, and, identities, in, a, context, of, resistance, that, it, is, important, to, interrogate, why, someone, might, be, distressed, about, low, sexual, desire, chasin, further, argues, that, clinicians, have, an, ethical, obligation, to, avoid, treating, low, sexual, desire, per, se, as, pathological, and, to, discuss, asexuality, as, a, viable, possibility, where, relevant, with, clients, presenting, clinically, with, low, sexual, desire, scholar, ianna, hawkins, owen, writes, studies, of, race, have, revealed, the, deployment, of, asexuality, in, the, dominant, discourse, as, an, ideal, sexual, behavior, to, justify, both, the, empowerment, of, whites, and, the, subordination, of, blacks, to, uphold, a, racialized, social, and, political, system, this, is, partly, due, to, the, simultaneous, sexualization, and, de, sexualization, of, black, women, in, the, mammy, archetype, as, well, as, by, how, society, de, sexualizes, certain, racial, minorities, as, part, of, a, bid, to, claim, superiority, by, whites, this, is, co, existent, with, the, sexualization, of, black, female, bodies, in, the, jezebel, archetype, both, utilized, to, justify, slavery, and, enable, further, control, owen, also, criticizes, the, investment, in, constructing, asexuality, upon, a, white, racial, rubric, who, else, can, claim, access, to, being, just, like, everyone, else, ben, brandley, and, angela, labrador, argue, that, asexual, identity, may, be, more, accessible, to, white, people, than, people, of, color, because, of, how, people, of, color, are, sexualized, michael, paramo, argues, in, an, article, for, aze, that, this, can, create, a, cyclical, perception, that, the, asexual, community, is, dominated, by, white, people, which, can, make, people, of, color, continue, to, feel, excluded, from, it, karen, cuthbert, comments, on, providing, the, first, empirically, grounded, discussion, of, this, intersection, of, asexuality, and, disability, and, to, a, lesser, extent, gender, and, race, eunjung, kim, comments, on, the, intersections, between, disability, or, crip, theory, and, asexuality, saying, disabled, people, are, more, frequently, de, sexualized, disabled, people, who, are, also, asexual, have, stated, that, they, can, feel, invisible, because, of, this, since, they, must, navigate, these, assumptions, both, within, the, asexual, and, disabled, communities, and, outside, of, them, anna, kurowicka, notes, that, asexual, people, may, sometimes, reject, the, notion, that, their, asexuality, is, related, to, disability, in, an, effort, to, avoid, unwanted, medical, intervention, at, the, same, time, disabled, people, may, reject, the, assumption, that, they, are, inherently, asexual, kurowicka, argues, that, contemporary, discourses, should, trouble, the, desire, to, separate, asexuality, and, disability, that, is, rooted, in, compulsory, sexuality, bogaert, argues, that, understanding, asexuality, is, of, key, importance, to, understanding, sexuality, in, general, for, his, work, bogaert, defines, asexuality, as, a, lack, of, lustful, inclinations, feelings, directed, toward, others, a, definition, that, he, argues, is, relatively, new, in, light, of, recent, theory, and, empirical, work, on, sexual, orientation, this, definition, of, asexuality, also, makes, clear, this, distinction, between, behavior, and, desire, for, both, asexuality, and, celibacy, although, bogaert, also, notes, that, there, is, some, evidence, of, reduced, sexual, activity, for, those, who, fit, this, definition, he, further, distinguishes, between, desire, for, others, and, desire, for, sexual, stimulation, the, latter, of, which, is, not, always, absent, for, those, who, identify, as, asexual, although, he, acknowledges, that, other, theorists, define, asexuality, differently, and, that, further, research, needs, to, be, done, on, the, complex, relationship, between, attraction, and, desire, another, distinction, is, made, between, romantic, and, sexual, attraction, and, he, draws, on, work, from, developmental, psychology, which, suggests, that, romantic, systems, derive, from, attachment, theory, while, sexual, systems, primarily, reside, in, different, brain, structures, concurrent, with, bogaert, s, suggestion, that, understanding, asexuality, will, lead, to, a, better, understanding, of, sexuality, overall, he, discusses, the, topic, of, asexual, masturbation, to, theorize, on, asexuals, and, target, oriented, paraphilia, in, which, there, is, an, inversion, reversal, or, disconnection, between, the, self, and, the, typical, target, object, of, sexual, interest, attraction, such, as, attraction, to, oneself, labelled, automonosexualism, in, an, earlier, 2006, article, bogaert, acknowledges, that, a, distinction, between, behavior, and, attraction, has, been, accepted, into, recent, conceptualizations, of, sexual, orientation, which, aids, in, positioning, asexuality, as, such, he, adds, that, by, this, framework, subjective, sexual, attraction, is, the, psychological, core, of, sexual, orientation, and, also, addresses, that, there, may, be, some, skepticism, in, the, academic, and, clinical, communities, about, classifying, asexuality, as, a, sexual, orientation, and, that, it, raises, two, objections, to, such, a, classification, first, he, suggests, that, there, could, be, an, issue, with, self, reporting, i, e, a, perceived, or, reported, lack, of, attraction, particularly, for, definitions, of, sexual, orientation, that, consider, physical, arousal, over, subjective, attraction, and, second, he, raises, the, issue, of, overlap, between, absent, and, very, low, sexual, desire, as, those, with, an, extremely, low, desire, may, still, have, an, underlying, sexual, orientation, despite, potentially, identifying, as, asexual, the, history, of, the, asexual, community, is, presently, undocumented, in, academic, work, although, several, private, websites, for, those, who, fall, under, the, modern, definition, of, asexuality, existed, online, in, the, 1990s, scholars, believe, that, it, was, not, until, the, early, 21st, century, when, a, community, of, self, identified, asexuals, began, to, form, aided, by, the, popularity, of, online, communities, several, small, communities, existed, online, such, as, the, leather, spinsters, nonolibidoism, society, and, haven, for, the, human, amoeba, documented, by, volkmar, sigusch, in, 2001, activist, david, jay, founded, the, asexual, visibility, and, education, network, aven, whose, stated, goals, are, creating, public, acceptance, and, discussion, of, asexuality, and, facilitating, the, growth, of, an, asexual, community, some, asexuals, believe, that, participation, in, an, asexual, community, is, an, important, resource, as, they, often, report, feeling, ostracized, in, broader, society, communities, such, as, aven, can, be, beneficial, to, those, in, search, of, answers, when, questioning, their, sexual, orientation, such, as, providing, support, if, one, feels, their, lack, of, sexual, attraction, constitutes, a, disease, online, asexual, communities, can, also, serve, to, inform, others, about, asexuality, however, affiliating, with, online, communities, among, asexual, people, vary, some, question, the, purpose, of, online, communities, while, others, heavily, depend, on, them, for, support, according, to, elizabeth, abbott, asexuality, has, always, been, present, in, society, though, asexual, people, kept, a, lower, profile, she, further, stated, that, while, the, failure, to, consummate, marriage, was, seen, as, an, insult, to, the, sacrament, of, marriage, in, medieval, times, and, has, been, sometimes, used, as, grounds, to, terminate, a, marriage, though, asexuality, has, never, been, illegal, unlike, homosexuality, however, the, recent, growth, of, online, communication, and, social, networking, as, facilitated, the, growth, of, a, community, built, upon, a, common, asexual, identity, in, 2009, aven, members, participated, in, the, first, asexual, entry, into, an, american, pride, parade, at, the, san, francisco, pride, parade, in, 2010, after, a, period, of, debate, surrounding, the, existence, of, a, pride, flag, to, represent, asexuality, as, well, as, a, system, to, create, one, the, asexual, pride, flag, was, formally, announced, the, final, design, was, a, popular, design, and, received, the, most, votes, in, an, online, open, access, poll, the, flag, s, colors, four, horizontal, stripes, of, black, gray, white, and, purple, from, top, to, bottom, represent, asexuality, gray, asexuality, allosexuality, and, community, respectively, they, have, also, since, been, used, as, a, representation, of, asexuality, as, a, whole, some, members, of, the, asexual, community, additionally, opt, to, wear, a, black, ring, on, their, right, middle, finger, colloquially, known, as, an, ace, ring, as, a, form, of, identification, some, asexuals, use, ace, playing, card, suits, as, identities, of, their, romantic, orientation, such, as, the, ace, of, spades, for, aromanticism, and, the, ace, of, hearts, for, non, aromanticism, on, june, 29, 2014, aven, organized, the, second, international, asexuality, conference, as, an, affiliate, worldpride, event, in, toronto, the, first, was, held, at, the, 2012, world, pride, in, london, the, second, such, event, which, was, attended, by, around, 250, people, was, the, largest, gathering, of, asexuals, to, date, the, conference, included, presentations, discussions, and, workshops, on, topics, such, as, research, on, asexuality, asexual, relationships, and, intersecting, identities, ace, week, formerly, asexual, awareness, week, occurs, on, the, last, full, week, in, october, it, is, an, awareness, period, that, was, created, to, celebrate, and, bring, awareness, to, asexuality, including, grey, asexuality, it, was, founded, by, sara, beth, brooks, in, 2010, international, asexuality, day, iad, is, an, annual, celebration, of, the, asexuality, community, that, takes, place, on, 6, april, the, intention, for, the, day, is, to, place, a, special, emphasis, on, the, international, community, going, beyond, the, anglophone, and, western, sphere, that, has, so, far, had, the, most, coverage, an, international, committee, spent, a, little, under, a, year, preparing, the, event, as, well, as, publishing, a, website, and, press, materials, this, committee, settled, on, the, date, of, 6, april, to, avoid, clashing, with, as, many, significant, dates, around, the, world, as, possible, although, this, date, is, subject, to, review, and, may, change, in, future, years, the, first, international, asexuality, day, was, celebrated, in, 2021, and, involved, asexuality, organizations, from, at, least, 26, countries, activities, included, virtual, meetups, advocacy, programs, both, online, and, offline, and, the, sharing, of, stories, in, various, art, forms, for, a, series, of, fictional, characters, in, books, and, comics, who, are, asexual, see, fictional, asexual, characters, several, works, of, fiction, that, have, asexual, themes, have, been, published, a, series, of, non, fiction, articles, and, books, covering, asexuality, have, been, published, studies, have, found, no, significant, statistical, correlation, between, religion, and, asexuality, with, asexuality, occurring, with, equal, prevalence, in, both, religious, and, irreligious, individuals, asexuality, is, more, common, among, celibate, clergy, as, non, asexuals, are, more, likely, to, be, discouraged, by, vows, of, chastity, according, to, aicken, et, al, a, higher, proportion, of, muslim, respondents, reported, that, they, did, not, experience, any, form, of, sexual, attraction, compared, to, christian, respondents, because, the, application, of, the, term, asexuality, is, relatively, recent, most, religions, do, not, have, clear, stances, on, it, in, matthew, 19, 11, 12, jesus, mentions, for, there, are, eunuchs, who, were, born, that, way, and, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, been, made, eunuchs, by, others, and, there, are, those, who, choose, to, live, like, eunuchs, for, the, sake, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, some, biblical, exegetes, have, interpreted, the, eunuchs, who, were, born, that, way, as, including, asexuals, while, christianity, has, not, directly, mentioned, asexuality, it, has, revered, celibacy, the, apostle, paul, writing, as, a, celibate, has, been, described, by, some, writers, as, asexual, he, writes, in, 1, corinthians, 7, 6, 9, i, wish, that, all, men, were, as, i, am, but, each, man, has, his, own, gift, from, god, one, has, this, gift, another, has, that, now, to, the, unmarried, and, the, widows, i, say, it, is, good, for, them, to, stay, unmarried, as, i, am, but, if, they, cannot, control, themselves, they, should, marry, for, it, is, better, to, marry, than, to, burn, with, passion, a, 2012, study, published, in, group, processes, intergroup, relations, reported, that, asexuals, are, evaluated, more, negatively, in, terms, of, prejudice, dehumanization, and, discrimination, than, other, sexual, minorities, such, as, gay, men, lesbians, and, bisexuals, both, homosexual, and, heterosexual, people, thought, of, asexuals, as, not, only, cold, but, also, animalistic, and, unrestrained, a, different, study, however, found, little, evidence, of, serious, discrimination, against, asexuals, because, of, their, asexuality, asexual, activist, author, and, blogger, julie, decker, has, observed, that, sexual, harassment, and, violence, such, as, corrective, rape, commonly, victimizes, the, asexual, community, sociologist, mark, carrigan, sees, a, middle, ground, arguing, that, while, asexuals, do, often, experience, discrimination, it, is, not, of, a, phobic, nature, but, more, about, marginalization, because, people, genuinely, don, t, understand, asexuality, asexuals, also, face, prejudice, from, the, lgbt, community, many, lgbt, people, assume, that, anyone, who, is, not, homosexual, or, bisexual, must, be, straight, and, frequently, exclude, asexuals, from, their, definitions, of, queer, although, many, well, known, organizations, devoted, to, aiding, lgbtq, communities, exist, these, organizations, generally, do, not, reach, out, to, asexuals, and, do, not, provide, library, materials, about, asexuality, upon, coming, out, as, asexual, activist, sara, beth, brooks, was, told, by, many, lgbt, people, that, asexuals, are, mistaken, in, their, self, identification, and, seek, undeserved, attention, within, the, social, justice, movement, other, lgbt, organizations, such, as, the, trevor, project, and, the, national, lgbtq, task, force, explicitly, include, asexuals, because, they, are, non, heterosexual, and, can, therefore, be, included, in, the, definition, of, queer, some, organizations, now, add, an, a, to, the, lgbtq, acronym, to, include, asexuals, however, this, is, still, a, controversial, topic, in, some, queer, organizations, in, some, jurisdictions, asexuals, have, legal, protections, since, 1999, brazil, has, banned, pathologization, or, attempted, treatment, of, sexual, orientation, by, mental, health, professionals, through, the, national, ethical, code, and, the, u, s, state, of, new, york, has, labeled, asexuals, as, a, protected, class, however, asexuality, does, not, typically, attract, the, attention, of, the, public, or, major, scrutiny, therefore, it, has, not, been, the, subject, of, legislation, as, much, as, other, sexual, orientations, have, asexual, representation, in, media, is, limited, and, rarely, openly, acknowledged, or, confirmed, by, creators, or, authors, in, works, composed, prior, to, the, beginning, of, the, twenty, first, century, characters, are, generally, automatically, assumed, to, be, sexual, and, the, existence, of, a, character, s, sexuality, is, usually, never, questioned, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, portrayed, his, character, sherlock, holmes, as, what, would, today, be, classified, as, asexual, with, the, intention, to, characterize, him, as, solely, driven, by, intellect, and, immune, to, the, desires, of, the, flesh, the, archie, comics, character, jughead, jones, was, likely, intended, by, his, creators, as, an, asexual, foil, to, archie, s, excessive, heterosexuality, but, over, the, years, this, portrayal, shifted, with, various, iterations, and, reboots, of, the, series, implying, that, he, is, either, gay, or, heterosexual, in, 2016, he, was, confirmed, to, be, asexual, in, the, new, riverdale, jughead, comics, the, writers, of, the, 2017, television, show, riverdale, based, on, the, archie, comics, chose, to, depict, jughead, as, a, heterosexual, despite, pleas, from, both, fans, and, jughead, actor, cole, sprouse, to, retain, jughead, s, asexuality, and, allow, the, asexual, community, to, be, represented, alongside, the, gay, and, bisexual, communities, both, represented, in, the, show, this, decision, sparked, conversations, about, deliberate, asexual, erasure, in, the, media, and, its, consequences, especially, on, younger, viewers, anthony, bogaert, has, classified, gilligan, the, eponymous, character, of, the, 1960s, television, series, gilligan, s, island, as, asexual, bogaert, suggests, that, the, producers, of, the, show, likely, portrayed, him, in, this, way, to, make, him, more, relatable, to, young, male, viewers, of, the, show, who, had, not, yet, reached, puberty, and, had, therefore, presumably, not, yet, experienced, sexual, desire, gilligan, s, asexual, nature, also, allowed, the, producers, to, orchestrate, intentionally, comedic, situations, in, which, gilligan, spurns, the, advances, of, attractive, females, films, and, television, shows, frequently, feature, attractive, but, seemingly, asexual, female, characters, who, are, converted, to, heterosexuality, by, the, male, protagonist, by, the, end, of, the, production, these, unrealistic, portrayals, reflect, a, heterosexual, male, belief, that, all, asexual, women, secretly, desire, men, asexuality, as, a, sexual, identity, rather, than, as, a, biological, entity, became, more, widely, discussed, in, the, media, in, the, beginning, of, the, twenty, first, century, the, fox, network, series, house, represented, an, asexual, couple, in, the, episode, better, half, 2012, however, this, representation, has, been, questioned, by, members, of, the, asexual, community, as, the, episode, concluded, that, the, man, simply, had, a, pituitary, tumor, that, reduced, his, sex, drive, and, the, woman, was, only, pretending, to, be, asexual, to, please, him, leading, to, controversy, over, the, representation, and, a, change, org, petition, for, fox, network, to, reconsider, how, it, represents, asexual, characters, in, the, future, stating, it, represented, asexuality, very, poorly, by, attributing, it, to, both, medical, illness, and, deception, other, fictional, asexual, characters, include, spongebob, and, his, best, friend, patrick, from, spongebob, squarepants, and, todd, chavez, from, bojack, horseman, generally, well, accepted, by, the, asexual, community, as, positive, representation
